<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the three hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, addressing the intense negative backlash they received following the resurfacing of a seven-year-old video showing Norton jumping on a homeless man's cake.  They vehemently defended their actions, claiming the man was a friend and was not harmed or offended. They described the online response as a "tsunami of hate," citing hundreds of thousands of negative tweets. This led to tangents about Norton's upcoming comedy special and appearances, including one on the Imus show; past antics involving homeless people they knew; an incident where Norton urinated in someone's oatmeal; Opie's recent Vegas trip (including a drive-in movie, shooting range experience with a full-automatic weapon, and seeing Penn & Teller); their upcoming two-week vacation; the departure of staff member Jackie; and upcoming projects like Norton's Epix special and a new Patrice O'Neal album release.  They also briefly mentioned a future guest with a very large scrotum, foreshadowing a later segment.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Joe Rogan's marijuana use with a Red Band crew before podcast tapings, with Opie admitting to joining in. This segued into commentary on new music from Lady Gaga and Katy Perry, including leaked song snippets and accusations of plagiarism.  A significant portion was dedicated to reviewing the box office and critical reception of *Paranoia*, featuring both positive and negative reviews.  A phone call with Bill Burr followed, covering his acting career (*Breaking Bad*), upcoming Beacon Theater shows, and opinions on A-Rod and baseball.  Macklemore leaving a message for Opie and the hosts' negative views on *Pawn Stars* were also briefly discussed. The segment ended with another mention of Wesley Warren Jr., the man with the massively enlarged scrotum, who would later be a guest.

Next, the hosts reminisced about a "Day at the Races" event where they encountered Groucho Marx (in a wheelchair), Alice Cooper, Artie Johnson, and Ben Gazzara, prompting a discussion about Diane Carroll from *Julia*. A large portion promoted Norton's new comedy special, "American Degenerate," including discussions about its production, finances, and the confusing number and identities of its opening guests.  The longest portion of this segment featured in-studio guest Wesley Warren Jr., who graphically detailed his experience living with a massive scrotal edema weighing up to 145 pounds. He described the challenges of daily life, his surgery, difficulties obtaining medical care, his appearance on the Howard Stern Show, and the logistical nightmares of air travel.

The following segment continued the interview with Wesley Warren Jr., focusing on his 132-pound scrotal mass, the difficulties of air travel, his surgery with Dr. Joel Gellman in Southern California (instead of Greece), and subsequent surgeries to address complications and fluid retention around his penis. He described his post-operative penis as being roughly an inch long and resembling an uncircumcised penis with a small opening, leading to urination problems requiring further surgery. He detailed the high cost of travel to California for these procedures.  The hosts interjected with crude jokes. Warren mentioned a TLC documentary, "The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum," airing that night, and a TLC representative was mentioned outside the studio.  Post-interview, the hosts discussed Warren's demeanor, his farting during the interview, and their reactions to shaking his hand. The show concluded with the usual advertising and promotional announcements, including Steven Singer Jewelers.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on?  Live now? Is he at me?  This is it.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people, real excitement.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Oh my God.  Man, everything's fucked up.  Is it?  Yep.  That kind of sounds...  My side doesn't sound bad.  Let me try this.  Testing, testing, testing.  There we go.  Hi, everybody.  Body.  That sounds all right.  Not really.  Hi, people. 
[00:01:30]  Wow.  Maybe it's all the water in my ears.  Is that it?  The sound of waves.  Out there at the beach?  The beach house.  Yeah.  Best thing I've done in years, having a beach house for the summer.  Yeah, that's pretty sweet.  You don't realize there's a world out there when you're at a beach.  You kind of don't pay attention to anything going on in the world.  Nope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pay attention a little bit.  A little bit?  Had a few bumps in the road over the last week, but... 
[00:02:00]  Why are you on vacation with a disco and a...  You should pick the hell of a week to...  All right.  Don't worry.  We'll come back.  Yeah.  We'll talk about everything we missed, I guess.  Yeah.  Yes, indeed.  Oh, my God.  Where do we begin?  Hmm.  And went to Vegas.  Yeah.  I was at the ocean.  Jimmy was in L.A.  I know.  It's so interesting to keep tabs on everyone on Twitter, you know? 
[00:02:30]  It's kind of cool, right?  Oh, look what you're up to.  Oh, Jimmy's doing some podcasts and having fun and doing shows and talking to people.  Oh, he's there at the beach.  Fending off a fucking...  A tsunami of hate.  Army of hatred.  There was a tsunami of hate.  Oh, my God.  I will never look at Twitter hate ever again the same way.  Nah.  Nah.  These motherfuckers.  Crazy.  They come in like a tsunami. 
[00:03:00]  They try to wipe out everything, and then they just move on to something else.  Like a locust.  I went from...  I exaggerated when I was telling other people, but no exaggeration, at least a quarter million  hate tweets.  At least.  At least.  And then within two or three days, it trickled down to almost nothing.  So it was like locusts.  They come in and just fucking destroy your soul.  And then move on.  And destroy your internet presence, and then they move on to the next disgusting video 
[00:03:30]  or whatever the fuck they're into.  It's like every alien movie where they come to Earth.  Oh, no.  They've come here to use our resources and then move on.  Oh, man.  That's what they're doing.  But...  It was like locusts.  Well, you know what?  You shouldn't have taken such a topical video.  And...  Why would he put that video up now?  Because I thought it would be all right.  How's that for an answer?  You just can't imagine.  Wasn't that online already, too?  Oh, yes.  The video has been online for seven fucking years. 
[00:04:00]  And there's some good quality hate in that version.  But it only did about 40,000 views.  And people have been requesting some of our old videos.  And we got them laying around.  So I'm like, I don't know.  Put it up there.  Fuck it.  It's been seven years.  Are the people that wrote the original hate on the original one, because it's been there  for seven years, are they mad at the new haters because they got on bandwagon jumpers?  Hey, I've been hating that video for years, man! 
[00:04:30]  Right.  And then, I don't even know where to begin.  Like, I can't believe something that we did, mostly me, obviously, seven years ago is coming  to light now.  Ridiculous.  Because that's the world we live in now.  We're all fucking susceptible to that.  Everyone, it doesn't matter if it was seven years ago, everyone can look at something that  you did now, take it completely out of context, get their holier-than-that-about attitude,  and start lambasting you for shit.  Of course.  I don't know.  I mean, I think most people know, but seven years ago, I jumped on a homeless guy's cake, 
[00:05:00]  but it wasn't just any homeless guy.  And it was a shitty...  It was Andrew.  It was a shitty, stale cake that he had next to him that day.  It was our pal.  And he was our pal.  Yeah.  We talked to the guy pretty much every day.  Every day on the walkover.  The walkover from K-Rock to the XM studio.  We had a few homeless people that we would talk to on the way.  And know why we had a few homeless people to talk to every day?  Because they knew we were coming every day.  They were opportunists. 
[00:05:30]  Because we gave them money and food and shit.  So we would see the same guys, and then the word would get out.  That sidewalk started getting pretty crowded.  Because the word got out like there's a whole bunch of people that will walk down the sidewalk  every day with microphones.  They will talk to you for a little bit, and then they and their fans will just give money.  A lot more money than an average day for these guys.  And I'm not even trying to justify anything.  And I'm just trying to get the facts out there and the story out there. 
[00:06:00]  I'm not, I haven't apologized or any of that shit.  I'm just getting the facts out there as I remember them.  Because I forgot all about this.  Seven years.  But they don't give a fuck that it was seven years ago.  They feel like it happened yesterday.  I personally, I'll tell you this much, have changed in a way where I don't even think I  would do that for a radio show now.  Yeah.  Back then I would, yes, of course.  Yeah.  I was different.  Most people are different seven years ago than they are today.  That fucking one dick bag that was posting the stills from the video. 
[00:06:30]  And here you are only leaving a dollar.  It's like, oh really?  So the whole, everything happened between the time the video started and ended?  Right.  It was, the guy made, he got money, he got food.  It didn't put him back at all.  He had a great time like a fucking human being with people.  So shut the fuck up.  Well, it was like, I literally felt like I was the codependent wife defending my husband  as I was on the fucking, like we had been at the party the night before and you drunkenly 
[00:07:00]  stomped a cake.  And I'm like, you don't understand.  He's had a lot of pressure at work.  But I was, I was actually, I explained this a couple of times while I was at, which was  fine.  It was fun to talk about.  But it was like, they don't understand the totality of the relationship with this guy.  Like it was a guy, you did that as a dick move to a guy that you do something that you,  to somebody, you know, like the same way, like we knew this guy.  It wasn't, Hey, let's be mean to a homeless guy.  It was like, let's do something funny to somebody that we know who's okay.  It's a weird fucking Andrew. 
[00:07:30]  There's a difference between that and a total stranger.  It's a total difference.  And I totally understand what you're saying, but those people, they will never even like  they, they will not even listen to the explanation whatsoever.  So you can put a price on a man's dignity.  No.  Get it.  The one thing I did say, uh, cause there was a followup video cause we, we found audio  of us talking to the guy.  Yeah.  I don't even know.  Cause like I said, it's been seven years, but it was probably a couple of weeks later,  maybe a week later.  I don't even know. 
[00:08:00]  I think it was like a week.  Yeah.  And, uh, in that video I do write, of course I would not just jump on a homeless guy's cake.  The context is that he became a friend of the show.  Yeah.  We saw him every fucking day.  We messed with him every day.  We goofed on him every day.  Yeah.  And he kind of goofed on us back.  Yes.  It was fun.  And, uh, fun.  So I felt in, in that world, the world we live in.  Yeah.  It was completely acceptable that day to jump on his, uh, his, uh, his stale cake, make 
[00:08:30]  Jimmy and Anthony cringe a little bit, knowing the guy would be completely fine with it,  which he was.  Yeah.  It wasn't like he was going to go.  First of all, he got, the reason he got money after that is he would have gotten money  anyway.  Yeah.  It was like people gave him money just because he was a guy we stopped and chatted with.  So you weren't just, everybody would have been horrified if we were just walking in  out of context, you jumped on a strange man's cake.  First of all, you wouldn't have, because you might've got sliced with a razor.  Nope.  Does anybody realize that you wouldn't jump on a homeless guy's cake unless you knew him? 
[00:09:00]  Because you don't know how he would react?  It's fucking insane.  You wouldn't do it to a guy who might pick up a broken bottle and stab you with it.  Of course not.  You do it to a guy who you know, who you're comfortable with, and there's a huge difference  in the, we were friendly with that guy and it was funny because of that.  Right.  It was like, when, when, when, and this is a different example, but like when me and I  was on McDougal Street and I had a nice slice of pizza and I hadn't even taken a bite and  Louie walked over and slapped it out of my hand to the ground.  Now I know the difference, but that was hilarious because nobody thought I'm not going to get 
[00:09:30]  more pizza.  Right.  It was just a guy being a dick knocking pizza out of my hand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he wouldn't just walk down the sidewalk and do that to someone.  He doesn't know.  No, not at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Fucking Louie.  I wouldn't.  But again, it's this, the, the age we are living in now gives everyone a voice and that  voice is just whatever they want to take out of context, whatever minute they want to  be fucking holier than thou and, and, and jump on this cause du jour or whatever it is. 
[00:10:00]  That's the world we live in now.  So everyone had this voice.  They see something, they don't even know what the fuck it is really, but they're outraged.  Oh boy.  They're really outraged.  You know, I'm a piece of shit.  I'm a piece of shit for other reasons, but not from a one minute video from seven years  ago.  Did you ever piss into, um, Louie's, uh, oatmeal?  Someone's saying, did I do that?  How about when Louie was eating oatmeal and Jimmy urinated it? 
[00:10:30]  Oh, did I?  I don't even remember that.  I think like he went to the bathroom or something and, and you, you went over there and you took  his oatmeal and you pissed at it during a break or something.  Oh, I didn't even remember that.  Oh, is that funny?  I had no memory of that.  That's the, that's the world we live in.  Yeah.  That should be, that should be something I remember every day when I wake up.  Oh my God.  I pissed at a man's oatmeal, but it's not, it's not a stretch that we did this with other 
[00:11:00]  people within our circle, including homeless, homeless people.  Fucking yeah.  Stalker Patty, friends of the show.  That's just how it is.  You know, there was more video that day, but when you're trying to make a video that's,  that's, you don't want to give away the stuff that happens after the big punchline.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Cause then it's, it's not, it's not as entertaining for people, you know, when the mics go off  and you see us all like taking out our fucking wallets and paying off, you know, someone. 
[00:11:30]  Oh yeah.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  It ruins the whole fucking moment.  Right.  Yeah.  You don't want people to see you being nice and video.  Oh, I hate that.  I don't want that rare occurrence to be seen.  No.  Oh, what do you got?  Did you find it?  It was actually live on the air.  It was live.  You want to hear it?  Sure.  Of course we don't.  Crotic notion to say, you're not even wrong.  What?  He pisses in my oatmeal.  Jim is pissing in my oatmeal.  Jim is literally pissing into my oatmeal. 
[00:12:00]  I was half done.  He just pissed into it.  I thought he was just, I thought he was just going to stick his dick in it.  That's what I thought, too.  Oh my God, it's pretty funny.  All right, I'll still eat it.  It's pretty funny.  If his dick was near it, I would still eat it.  Right.  No, it has to be.  You just pissing in my oatmeal.  Look, Jimmy just pulled his dick out and pissed into my oatmeal.  By the way, how do you have that kind of control that you can just piss an ounce?  What the fuck? 
[00:12:30]  It's like your piss is a syringe with the fucking, those little black gradiated lines on it.  How many cc's was that?  What the fuck?  Holy shit.  He's making some good points here.  Oh my God.  That's what he thinks of what you have to say.  No, no.  It just had to be done.  The oatmeal was mocking me, daring me to urinate on it.  Like a fucking cat.  That's mine now.  A couple things on the Homeless Charlie thing.  We never saw the guy, oh, and then we got Homeless Charlie. 
[00:13:00]  And then we were explaining something else.  Yeah.  See, we were really close with the homeless.  Yes.  What year was that?  To be Tom.  2010.  Three years ago.  And I'm glad.  It's funny.  I thought of this as I was watching the video of the cake stump.  I'm like, that's the one time I'm really happy that Steve would watermark everything  with the date.  Because I didn't remember that that was so many fucking years ago.  It was six to seven years ago.  It's really hard to explain our world to people that don't live in this circle of  ours, where it's completely acceptable in the end to piss in someone's oatmeal. 
[00:13:30]  You can't do that at your job.  Go ahead.  Go up to the receptionist at your workplace right now and just piss in our breakfast.  You just can't do that.  That's funny.  But we live in this really fucking strange world.  Yes, we do.  And then when the outsiders, the people mostly that attacked in the last week are outsiders  that have really never heard this show, to be honest with you.  I mean, the whole hip-hop community got involved because WorldStarHipHop posted the video.  They are the fucking benchmark for morality. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Oh, I disagree.  Oh, Jimmy.  Yeah, they're completely outraged by the one-minute homeless video, but the shit that's on WorldStarHipHop.  And I'm not trashing the guys because I go there.  Their videos are crazy and, you know, out of control.  Five guys beating the shit out of one guy, blindside punches, kicking.  But they're okay with all those videos, but this is the one that really got to them for some reason.  I don't get it.  That's why I just, like, I can't fucking deal with the phony outrage that we live in a world now that's just phony outrage. 
[00:14:30]  What bothered me the most, like, I understand why people would see that and go, what the fuck?  Because if you don't know the show, all you see is a guy jumping on a homeless guy's cake.  Right.  And you hear laughing.  Like, they don't understand that those are fans.  Those are all people who genuinely liked Andrew and he genuinely liked us.  And we were talking to him about his drinking and trying to get him to stop.  And then they're like, and then they did a homeless shopping spree.  Like, they just didn't understand the fact that, yeah, we did a homeless shopping spree. 
[00:15:00]  But those homeless guys were loved.  They were rock stars.  When they were trying to goof on that, they were saying, yeah.  And they've also done something called a homeless shopping spree.  They just don't know anybody.  These people who don't listen to the show just don't understand it.  Where we give homeless people money so they could buy winter clothes and be treated like fucking rock stars for a day.  They were never mocked when they did that.  Yeah, what assholes.  But to be honest, you know, the homeless shopping spree started out as a goof.  Yes.  Bring homeless people to the mall and bother a lot of people.  Yep.  But something happened with that whole thing where we spun that and went, holy crap, these 
[00:15:30]  guys are like rock stars for a day.  Yeah, yeah, yep.  And the whole bit changed.  People loved them.  People loved those guys.  Yeah, man.  Thousands of people would show up in the malls.  Everyone was behind the homeless.  And Gray Wolf.  And I also had to point out that it was Opie who pushed fucking for a mustard.  Like, you know, we didn't give a shit about him.  I mean, we cared about him as a man.  But like, you're the one who, he did the song.  Yeah, me and Ant didn't push for him to get a recording contract. 
[00:16:00]  You were the one trying to get this guy a recording contract and a deal.  And it's like, but people don't see that.  So I have to say it because you don't.  But people don't see that shit.  It's like, I sound like an asshole if I bring up the good shit.  Oh, why?  Why?  I felt obligated.  That's why I hear it because you can't talk to these people.  I had one tweet.  I'm like, you can't explain yourself to people that choose not to listen.  Right.  You don't have to like what happened and all that.  But you don't even get past the point of these people even listening to what you have to say. 
[00:16:30]  And it was hard to explain that.  Like, you know, first of all, it was not me who stomped the cake.  But more importantly.  No, it's just, it's funny when people just don't understand the whole picture.  And I almost get why they would see that and get pissed off.  I'm like, all right, how would I feel if I didn't know the show?  How do you explain the fucking, the texture of the show and our relationships with people?  But those people, they don't care.  They don't care about any of that.  They don't care about the relationship we had with the guy before, during, or after. 
[00:17:00]  They don't care that it was, I was walking around my beach house.  I'm renting.  I don't have an actual beach house.  I'm just renting for the summer.  And I'm just going, I'm talking to myself.  I'm like, this was seven years ago.  Seven years.  Seven years ago.  Seven years.  And they're like, it doesn't matter if it was seven years ago.  You're a piece of shit.  I'm like, it was seven years ago.  A piece of shit again.  I've worked on myself for seven years.  All of a sudden.  Seven years ago.  Back to being a piece of shit.  I'm like, holy fuck. 
[00:17:30]  And I, and I mean this with all sincerity.  I don't think I could do that same bit now.  But back then, yeah, I did.  Yeah.  And I had no problem doing it within the context of what we do as a radio show.  Exactly.  And the relationships we build with whether they're comics or homeless people.  Context has no place in people's lives these days.  It really is an amazing place we're at in history.  Context means nothing anymore.  We would bring homeless guys in, Tippy Tom especially. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  I love Tippy Tom.  And as a goof, like, and it was out one day, I'm like, hey, co-host a show with us.  And he just, the homeless, you know.  Had to throw away all my stuff.  But how do you explain that to anyone?  Also, we just bring a homeless guy that didn't know, you know, doesn't know where his meal's  coming from or where he's sleeping.  Next thing you know, he's hosting a radio show with us.  Yep.  You can't explain this stuff to people.  Go to bus.  Yeah.  We've always been friends to the homeless. 
[00:18:30]  Homeless people.  And always, always took care of them.  Very cool to have around on the show.  This company kind of shut it down because we wanted to continue the homeless shopping  spree.  They wanted to do it in a fucking Costco or something.  And we always wanted, we always like bringing in the new homeless because they're just fascinating  people.  Yeah.  They really are fascinating.  But whatever.  I mean, it was.  And then they, then they attacked a Sandy Kane video saying, and he also smashed a homeless  lady's guitar. 
[00:19:00]  She's not homeless.  And she's an entertainer.  She's been entertaining homeless forever.  And she's another one that in the end was completely cool with what happened.  Cause she understood the context of the fucking radio show.  They were looking to be like, wow, look, I, I, I uncovered another one.  Right.  Like, Oh, look at me.  Look at, I'm a detective on the internet in the context of a fucking radio show.  Would I walk around just smashing people's shit?  No, I'd get my teeth knocked out. 
[00:19:30]  Can't stand the fucking phoniness.  I'm not a brave person in the end, but in our world, then you know, okay, everyone's  going to be cool with this in the end.  It's going to be a bit shocking.  Yeah.  A bit edgy.  Yeah.  But I don't do this as I'm just walking around.  Oh, that fucking prune in a cowboy hat.  Fuck her too.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  We did a lot.  We did a lot of good by her.  And, uh, in the end she, you know, she sued me and Anthony over the guitar thing.  Yeah.  She made our lives kind of miserable for a few weeks there. 
[00:20:00]  That fucker.  But in the end, we were friends with her too.  She got it.  She totally understood it.  Yeah.  Ah, whatever.  I think that was it, right?  Yeah.  I mean, what else can you say?  You know?  I saw a couple of funny tweets where people were like, and then look what Opie did.  And then it was the basketball church.  Oh, yeah.  I got caught.  I got good numbers on that video.  Thanks.  I got caught.  I got good numbers on that.  Yeah.  Click on that goddamn video. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  I guess that's all we got to say about that.  I mean, they're not, you know, they're not even going to listen to what we have to say  today.  But of course not.  At least you got the whole story out there.  Those ass wipes.  Seven years ago, though.  Seven years.  What were you doing seven years ago?  Seven years.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Is it climbing the charts again?  No.  I'm looking for, like Jim said, some people were posting clips on Reddit of like, asshole 
[00:21:00]  Opie, you know, and then does something that's like.  It's nothing.  It's a basketball clip.  It's like, yeah.  Right.  There's a lot of LNA fans on Reddit, too.  I mean, that was just.  Yeah.  I appreciate the guys on Reddit that kind of like stood up for me and the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people just didn't know what to make it.  Honestly, people who had never heard of the show or had heard of it in passing or just  as a bad boy show see that.  And that's all the context they have.  I understand.  That's the problem with the world.  We live in a little fucking research. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fucking egg.  I understand.  Assholes.  Yeah.  I understand.  I understand the outrage, but, you know, at least you got more of the story.  It wasn't just one.  It wasn't just a minute video of some random fucking homeless guy.  Yeah.  Then I'd be on your side.  Fuck.  We knew him by name and everything.  Does anyone else out there know a homeless guy by name?  We probably know 20 of them. 
[00:22:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  And the line that got everybody was the line that we love.  Treat yourself.  Treat yourself.  Treat themselves.  Yeah.  Treat yourself.  Now, you know what?  I don't want any homeless man sidewalk cake today.  Well, you can hear it.  It's funny.  In the video, you can hear me going, you know, it's nothing.  The one thing is I'm the coat of Pinnacle.  I'm going, no, you have some, Andrew.  And Anthony's going, I am not touching that. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I guess that's it.  So, yeah.  More of the story.  You know, do what you have to, I guess.  But, fuck.  I'm sure you'll get a little resurgence now that we talked about.  Of course.  And there'll be more hate.  A little aftershock.  But their hate's okay.  But my hate's not.  Oh, yeah.  And maybe someone can explain that to me someday.  Yeah.  What I did was awful.  But the things they want to happen to me now is completely acceptable. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Because I was a piece of shit.  So, it doesn't matter that they're now being a piece of shit attacking what I did.  Yeah.  Yes.  There's some, there's some, asshole Opie does nothing while Roland gets tickled to death by  a hot girl.  Asshole.  That same asshole forces a homeless man to perform cover songs without appropriate licensing.  That's funny.  That's a good one.  There's some funny Reddit stuff.  Oh, shit.  Plenty of fans.  I'm doing an AMA on Friday.  My special comes out Friday.  So, I'm like, I'm doing the AMA. 
[00:23:30]  I know.  I'm actually thinking of hiring a typist.  Oh, wow.  Because this is going to pop up.  I don't want to have to fucking try to type all the fucking explanation.  Actually, I know this is going to pop up.  Like, what about that video?  I want to get someone who can type really fast.  And just fucking.  Yeah.  Some woman, of course.  Forgotten acts of Opie kindness.  Giving this make-a-wish boy Cialis in a hoodie footie jammies.  And it's a photo of you.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  It's a little Jimmy.  Is that the pink one?  It really shows my hog?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's something.  Yeah, we were, obviously we were on vacation during all this. 
[00:24:00]  Did it seem like longer than a week that we were gone?  I feel like I haven't seen you guys in a month.  Oh, yes.  Yeah, it was nice.  Very long.  Nice little break.  We'll be loved.  Yeah, it did.  It did.  We had, you know, a couple of weekends in there and the week off.  And then we go on vacation next week again.  Yep.  Yeah, don't freak out, people.  Come on.  I mean, this is the two-week vacation that we broke up.  Yeah, we usually do two weeks every summer, but we broke it up into a weird three-week period  where week off, week on, week off. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And it's rare because for most of the year, we keep the channel live.  Because we've all been taking several vacations.  It's very rare that we both take the same week nowadays.  Yeah, yeah.  So.  Just figure, what the hey-ho.  But we'll be back after Labor Day, you know, stronger than ever.  Ah, yes.  I was screaming out my window at, you know, whatever, quarter to six this morning. 
[00:25:00]  Really?  That's some asshole next to me.  Was that me?  Was I stopped at a light?  Because I saw what I thought was your car.  Really?  No.  And I tried to speed up to see if it was you.  Because I'm commuting the same way you are nowadays.  It was, some guy obviously is in front of me.  And I know how the lights are timed.  So don't fuck with me.  I zip through the green lights and I get here and it's very nice.  And if I get stuck in a light because one asshole is pulling this back and forth, not letting me pass. 
[00:25:30]  Right.  Move.  Because he doesn't feel I should pass him.  Then I got a problem.  And that's exactly what happened.  So I went to go around his right side.  And he zooms over to the right.  Like really cuts over aggressively.  So then I go to the left.  But by that point, the light had turned red.  So I'm parked next and I see his window go down.  So mine goes right down.  And he's, of course, of course.  What are you doing at this hour?  What are you doing at this hour? 
[00:26:00]  Where do you have to be?  I just looked at him.  I said, why don't you go fuck your mother?  It took him by surprise.  Of course it took me by surprise.  I'm sitting here.  Have fun with Reddit today.  Have fun with Reddit.  Oh, fuck your mother.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's like, yeah, well, you mother.  And then he starts cursing at me.  And we're just yelling at a quarter to six.  I'm yelling.  It's my first fucking commute back. 
[00:26:30]  And I'm yelling.  And he's really getting.  And he goes, you're an asshole.  And, you know, getting me on that shit.  I was like, what business is it of yours where I have to be?  Or how fucking I'm driving to get there?  I go, the reason I'm sitting here yelling at your fucking ass is that you fucked me on this light.  Fuck you.  What are you going to do about it?  He says.  I go, what am I going to do?  I'm going to wait.  And when the light turns green, I'm going to go.  What else do you want me to do about it? 
[00:27:00]  Fuck you.  And then he starts.  Because it's like, I love that.  What are you going to do about it?  Nothing.  How do you not just fucking, I'm going to do this.  I would love to be in the movies.  I would love it to be a TV show.  But it's not.  So I just sit there and yell.  I yell at them.  And then, of course, I think I close it off with, why don't you go back where you came from?  Yeah.  You know, because without a good racial epithet out there, I don't feel satisfied. 
[00:27:30]  Not good.  So, yeah.  But.  Welcome back.  Yeah, that was a fine.  Usually that takes a day or two.  How do you do?  And I got to throw a salute to the tunnel cop that gave me all those tickets.  Right.  A couple weeks back.  I was going through, and I'm using my blinker like a maniac in front of the thing, so he can't  give me another blinker one. 
[00:28:00]  And I use my blinker.  I get behind my truck.  And, boy, the truck has stopped.  It's not going through.  So I've used my blinker.  I got into the other lane.  And he's standing right there.  So I looked at him, gave a little quirk smile, and fucking threw him a salute.  At the tunnel?  Yeah.  Oh, so you're back on good terms.  No, no.  It was very sarcastic.  Oh, good.  Good.  Yeah, I've spoken with a lot of police officers that say everyone knows what's going on down  there.  Okay.  The cops love it and think it's hilarious, because they have no respect for those guys 
[00:28:30]  either.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was my fucking drive in.  Yeah, but it looks...  First day.  It looked like you had a nice, relaxing week in Vegas.  Oh, it was so nice.  Gambling.  Hanging by the pool.  Acting lessons.  Dancing lessons.  I think you went to a drive-in, it looked like.  I went to a drive-in movie.  Did you really?  Yeah, there ain't many drive-ins left in the nation, and they got a big, in Vegas,  they got a big drive-in movie complex.  Did you have to put the speaker in, or it's now on the FM dial?  I was telling my girly about that whole speaker thing, and she laughed at it. 
[00:29:00]  She couldn't even fathom the fucking speaker.  You had to yank out big metal fucking speaker into your window.  Oh, you used to have to bring it in.  Whose job is it to check that?  Oh, boy.  We don't have interns anymore.  That would have been a good one.  I was going to do like a...  How it used to sound with the...  Right.  Yeah.  We still have an intern.  We do.  Fucking young guy. 
[00:29:30]  What's his name?  Because of the T.  I don't know his name.  Tyler.  Tyler.  Sure.  Okay.  Tyler Fried Chicken.  We lost to two broads.  We're down on the one guy, right?  I miss Jackie's last day.  It's heartbreaking.  It was a great send-off.  Did she have a banner send-off?  Did she?  Yeah.  She got serenaded by Ryan Starr.  Ryan Starr was singing to her.  She started crying.  She was crying.  I want a dork.  Her mom was here with her.  Oh, her mom did come in.  She got a little teary-eyed.  You know, I don't want to misrepresent it. 
[00:30:00]  And the mom was very doable.  Very doable.  Very doable.  Absolutely.  Yeah, so that was fun.  But yeah, drive-in movie, man.  I saw that horrible movie.  Which one?  That one with fucking Matt Damon.  Elysium.  Elysium.  Oh, Elysium.  Elysium.  Was it good?  Oh, it's just, it's such fucking liberal cocksuck drivel.  That is like, and I don't even mind, like, if a movie is slanted liberal, because most 
[00:30:30]  of them are, and if it's well done, but this was so obvious.  Oh, look out, the rich people live in the luxurious, spacey place, and on the earth, in  the shit and filth and litter and poverty, are a bunch of black people.  Ah, they're running around, but they'll get them.  It's exactly what it was.  You don't like the simplicity of the message, the obviousness of the message.  It's so obvious, and so simplistic.  All I was thinking, when I'm watching the impoverished people of earth, instead of the rich corporate 
[00:31:00]  scum on their little space thing, was, why don't they all pick up a piece of paper off  the fucking street, so it cleans it up a little bit?  You live on earth!  Clean it!  I'm yelling at the drive-in.  Yeah, but I forgot how that drive-in experience works.  You gotta get a Disney movie or something.  Something nice and easy.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  You go into a drive-in.  There wasn't much to choose from.  There wasn't much out.  Herbie and the Love Bug.  The Love Bug.  Well, that's kind of what I remember seeing, and not the one with fucking Lindsay Lohan  either.  Who looks like she got her shit together, as I was going for her.  Did she?  Yeah?  I don't know.  We'll see, but I was watching the Oprah interview as I was falling asleep last night, and I'm  like, that's the same Lindsay Lohan?  She must have pulled into that makeup room like a pit crew.  Please, Oprah.  She looks really healthy, because we have beat the shit out of her over the years. 
[00:32:00]  She looks really, really healthy and together.  Hopefully, she won't go back to her old ways.  Good for her.  Yeah, I hope she does.  I mean, what was really annoying was the fact that she got away with everything before  she fucking ran somebody over.  It's like, good for you.  I hope she gets sober.  She owned up to a lot of things, but I think Oprah asked her about cocaine, and she said  she only did it 10 to 15 times in her entire life.  That's hard to...  Co-fucking-cane?  She said her thing is drinking.  And the reason she did the drinking, the cocaine, was so she could drink longer and stay 
[00:32:30]  up longer.  That's a good strategy.  I've actually heard that from many, many people.  That's a smart girl right there.  That really wasn't her thing, cocaine.  She said 10 to 15 times, she admitted to.  And the Adderall, she said she was on.  Yeah, Adderall, huh?  But it was mostly a drinking thing with her.  You know what?  I hope she does all right.  I think you need more than an interview.  You were paid $2 million.  Oh, I know.  I know.  To show that you're back.  Nice.  But Oprah's not an easy...  She doesn't let you get away with shit, really. 
[00:33:00]  $2 million now.  She's a very good...  Yeah, she got $2 million for the interview, and she's doing an eight-part reality series  for Oprah's channel.  She got $2 million, though.  Yeah.  For the whole thing, or just the interview?  The whole thing, probably.  Wow.  You know, we beat up Oprah, too, but she knows how to interview somebody.  I heard it was not exclusive.  She doesn't let you off the hook.  No?  I heard it was just not...  It was just to get, as they say, eyeballs on her channel.  That's what it was for.  Right, right, right.  Just two people watching.  Ah, yeah.  Hey, oh.  I didn't even know Oprah was out there.  She could have had me for two grand. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, Elo, what's wrong with you?  Exactly.  I think it's...  I saved you a couple million dollars.  You know, and Jim is trying to fight the urge from having girls with fucking penises  come to his house.  It's been a very tough road, Oprah.  Why, Jim?  Why?  I don't know.  I'm questioning everything.  Do-do-do-do, the Oprah music.  Yes.  You think we'd get the same amount of eyeballs on the Oprah channel?  Not at all.  Have you got us instead of Lindsay Lohan?  No.  Of course not.  No, it was a pretty good interview, though.  I kind of enjoyed it as I was crashing. 
[00:34:00]  But anyway, so Herbie the Love Bug, drive-in movie.  Went to the drive-in, and then went to the shooting range they got out there.  I love Vegas.  Full automatic weaponry.  God damn, is that a pisser.  And they just don't allow that on Long Island, huh?  At the ranges?  No, not full automatic.  Not as much.  Oh, there.  That was fucking great.  Wait, what were we looking at?  Yeah, that thing was the pisser.  What was that?  A saw. 
[00:34:30]  It's called a saw.  It's just fucking full automatic.  You just rent them?  Great.  Yeah.  Can you rent guns on ranges on Long Island?  I don't even know.  But in Vegas, you can.  Vegas, you can.  In Vegas, if someone doesn't have a pistol license, you can still rent a pistol, go out  there shooting fucking pistol.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Full automatic.  Wow.  It's a pisser.  We did the thing where you got an instructor in there with you, goes over the weapons with  you and stuff like that. 
[00:35:00]  And it gives you a lot of time, alone time.  I'm not in there with a bunch of riffraff.  Aren't you scared?  There's a picture of you with the saw.  Yeah.  So you rented that for, what, a half hour?  Well, I rented a bunch of guns.  Now your fingerprints are all over it, and now they do another crime with the gun.  Yeah, right?  Or they did the crime beforehand, and then they hand you the fucking saw.  That's a pretty good scenario for a little twist in a movie, right?  Yeah, that guy, I don't know.  We shot him up.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun going to the range, shooting some more exotic automatic weaponry. 
[00:35:30]  It is a lot of fun.  It's just something about shooting automatic.  Went to go see Penn and Teller.  Did that, too.  Saw their little magic show out there.  Yeah, it's just a lot of fucking fun.  What a fun show.  You get to talk to Penn afterwards?  He had family over, so he had to go and leave right away after the show.  But I saw him for a few minutes.  I was able to talk to him.  We were texting beforehand, also.  Did you talk to Teller? 
[00:36:00]  No, but he talks.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, he gets out there and talks.  Wait, he gets out there and talks on the show now?  No, after the show.  He'll talk to people and stuff.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun, man.  What a great vacation.  And then when we weren't doing shit, we were getting cabanas by the fucking big pool complex  over there at MGM.  It's fantastic.  I miss the MGM.  We used to go out there every year for the show.  Oh, that's another thing.  We decided to go take the rental car, which was a Mustang convertible. 
[00:36:30]  And I was taking it off-roading in the mountains, in the desert mountains by Hoover Dam.  And what a pisser that was.  How long of a ride was in Hoover Dam?  Three hours or so?  No, it's fucking like real close to Vegas.  It's right there.  It's right there.  It's less than an hour, I think.  Yeah, less than an hour.  How was it?  It's big.  We didn't stop.  We didn't do anything.  We stopped at the pull-off areas for the car, snap a few pics, and then fucking go. 
[00:37:00]  I can't imagine what you'd do.  Like, and here's where they poured the cement.  And the concrete, it's still cooling.  It's going to cool for another hundred years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did they say that really?  Something like that.  Supposedly the concrete's still cooling.  Why?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Concrete is a weird chemical thing that, like, stays hot for a long time.  I don't know exactly.  But they said it's going to be cooling for another...  Oh, that was a bad hundred years.  God.  What happened?  Those are the...  Wait, before you get to that...  Chocolate chips. 
[00:37:30]  Hold on.  What's that?  Exactly.  Before you get to that, the Hoover Dam was...  Because nothing?  I've never been.  It's cool.  It's very cool.  Is it huge?  To look at.  It's giant.  So why when you walk across it?  Can't you do the walk across?  We drove across it.  We drove across the top.  There's a road.  All right.  Okay.  You drive across and you see people walking and shit and snapping pictures.  But you could take pictures from fucking, you know, either side.  Okay.  And once you see it, like, I don't really...  I don't care to...  Is there a lot of water on the one side? 
[00:38:00]  Oh, there seems to be a lot of water on one side.  Not so much on the other.  It's an interesting phenomenon.  Well, what would happen if that thing fucking, dare I say, you know, blown up or something?  Well, I guess it would drain the beautiful Lake Mead.  Right.  Which is out there.  Took some pictures of that.  There's a lake of beer.  Oldie time beer.  Yeah.  Lake Mead.  Good. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That was cool.  And then driving the Mustang off-road was like, you got to really look and go, okay, I could...  That looks like an oil pan ripper outer.  Well, I better go up on the edge a little bit.  And yeah, you really can't just tool around in that thing.  But yeah, it was kind of cool.  I hadn't been in the desert in a long time like that.  Just kind of walking around.  Got out.  See any rattlesnakes?  No rattlesnakes, but I saw some longhorn ram. 
[00:39:00]  Really?  Yeah, those big fucking things that go ram, boom, and hit each other on the horns.  They're in Vegas?  I thought they were only in the mountains.  Yeah, they're in the fucking mountain.  No, they weren't walking down the strip, Jimmy.  I was in the mountains.  Oh.  Wait, you saw those?  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  Like the rams, rams?  Big horn sheep.  No shit.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  They looked ridiculous.  We came around the corner on the dirt road.  I was going real slow, because like I said, I was off-roading in a fucking Ford Mustang. 
[00:39:30]  And we came around the corner, and all of a sudden, you just saw them kind of run off  a little bit, and then stopped and turned to look.  Like, oh, cool.  Fucking started snapping some pitches.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was our little nature excursion.  Very cool.  Which was fun.  I liked our little nature excursion.  You did a lot.  Yeah.  Usually, you just kind of hang out in your room and do a little gambling.  A little gambling.  Maybe a little dinner, but you got out there.  I did do a little gambling. 
[00:40:00]  Well, that's another thing, too.  It's like, dinner was interesting.  It's, um, because I'm used to, you know, going out to some fine restaurants to get some fine  dinners in.  But, uh, you know, when the girl you're with just wants to go to In-N-Out Burger every night.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She likes that In-N-Out Burger.  She doesn't like the fine dining, though?  What are you going to do?  Oh, wow.  Jesus. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, but you can get fine dining anywhere.  Well, that's true.  You can't get In-N-Out here.  Those goddamn In-N-Out burgers are pretty fucking good.  You know what?  I saw one.  I've never had an In-N-Out Burger.  They're not West Coast.  I mean, sorry, East Coast.  No.  But no fine dining?  What?  The steak is tough on her braces?  No, wow.  It's not like she's dropping it on her legs.  She can't.  She's polio.  Polio.  The thing is, you know how lucky you are?  You have exactly the opposite problem.  Every guy wants to take his chick for an In-N-Out Burger. 
[00:41:00]  They want steak.  Yes.  That's great.  I fucking chill let me spend $20 a night on food.  It could be worse.  In-N-Out Burger is awesome.  It was really...  Really?  Yeah.  Nice.  You don't get them that often.  You know.  Yeah.  Did you ever go to the Wynn?  The food at the fucking Wynn?  I went to the fucking buffet there once.  Good, yeah.  Dude, it made me want to stay there.  I went during the day just for like whatever the buffet is.  It was amazing food there.  But I'm not a VIP, so I just would hate to stay there. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  In your eyes I am, but...  In your eyes.  And then I guess the first weekend we were there, it was like the first night, maybe  Sunday night or something.  I'm not sure what night it was.  They had this...  Oh, Jim Norton.  What?  Is he coming up on Imus?  I'm doing Imus tomorrow.  Oh, tomorrow?  Nice.  Wait, aren't you doing our show tomorrow?  Meaning your show?  Yes, I'll be here tomorrow, but I'll be doing Imus as well.  Oh, interesting.  6.35.  I'll be a little late. 
[00:42:00]  Well, this is a big...  One reason we came back is because this is a big week for Jimmy.  Yes.  Very big.  Your special is Friday, right?  Yes.  And I'm just doing a lot of promotion.  I'm very happy we're back.  And the trailer was released, the open to your special.  Yes.  Very funny.  Yes.  It's on our Facebook if you haven't seen it yet.  I thought everyone saw it, because I saw it when you taped.  I went up to Boston with Jimmy for the taping of his latest comedy special.  And there's part of it that I left out, which you'll see when it airs.  I left a little part of it out just to get a minute and a half of it. 
[00:42:30]  But there was like 30 seconds, about 45 seconds left out of it.  Right.  Because I wanted to just get the quick hit.  I forgot that no one has really seen it.  No.  I thought it was already out there.  Yeah, he retweeted it.  He loves it.  So, you like?  It's great.  Thank you.  Amazing.  The opening for Jimmy's special is amazing.  Thank you, brother.  I hope people enjoy it.  Just go to our Facebook page.  I don't even want to say who's in it or in it.  I want them to be surprised, because there's a nice reveal there.  Yeah.  So, just go to Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  You know, after you fucking spill your hate, maybe you could laugh at the opening of 
[00:43:00]  Jim Norton's big comedy special.  That's airing Friday.  There's also a list of all the podcasts that Jimmy did while in L.A. up on the Facebook as well.  Okay.  Yeah, they were all good, man.  How was Kevin Pollack's?  Phenomenal.  I did his video shoot.  He would love to have you guys on.  Yeah.  He's a genuine fucking fan of the show.  How much is he going to pay?  He paid me, I want to say a grand, but it was more like nothing.  But the guys that we've had on this show, every one of them that was in town, like I 
[00:43:30]  think I asked Bob Burr, but he was going to be gone.  He wasn't there.  And a couple of other people just weren't physically there.  But everybody who was in town was amazing.  Everyone said yes.  Chris Hardwick went out of his way to have an earlier, just so I could do it.  And Kevin Smith went out of his way.  That's awesome.  Jay, every one of them completely fucking helped me out.  That's fucking cool.  And Pollack reached out to me during the whole fucking crazy cake stomp video. 
[00:44:00]  Please lose my number.  I know, right?  Exactly.  He just, it was simple.  He just texted me and wrote, fuck the internet.  That's all he wrote.  I'm like, all right, right on, Kev.  Thanks for reaching out.  He's a good man.  Yeah.  Jimmy will be on I Miss tomorrow.  The big comedy special is Friday.  What time?  I don't know.  10 o'clock.  10 o'clock on Epix and epixhd.com.  You can just get Epix HD.  Right.  For, you know, get it for two weeks.  If you don't like it, don't keep it.  Get the trial.  It's free. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  What were you saying before?  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  We're all over the place.  We'll go back to you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm on it.  I just, okay.  I'm on it.  I just want to make sure people get the word out.  Oh, that's where, oh, we came back to kind of, you know, push Jimmy's special, and then  we go back on vacation.  Yes.  I like the two.  I like the break.  It gave me something to look for.  I can't, it felt like longer than a week, and I came back, and I'm like, this is like  a nice breakup, a nice easy week, fucking, and then nice relaxing thing again. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  But then we come back, and I don't know, are we doing the bus trip?  I don't know if we are officially.  We're only, what, less than a month out.  You would assume that we'd be promoting the fuck out of it.  Oh, they all freaked out, like, oh, no.  I hope so.  There was so much time, and now it's only a month, and, oh, I'll tell you one thing.  I saw over the weekend, Larry the Cable Guy does that Only in America show, and he visited 
[00:45:30]  Branson, Missouri, and saw some of the attractions there, and visited and spoke with Yakov, and  my God, it just, Yakov's not there, but.  It looks like a horrible place.  Was that, that's what you were going to say, right?  Oh, my God.  Really?  That's where we got to go.  They went to see this big magician named Kirby.  Yay!  Kirby's out there, and, oh, my God.  It looks like the worst. 
[00:46:00]  What's his last name, your enthusiasm-y?  You did not miss Chip.  You didn't?  No.  Oh, Kirby.  He did a horrible trick, and then they...  Isn't that the Blue Lagoon guy?  Right?  It looks like him.  What the fuck was his name?  Christopher Atkins.  Yeah.  Christopher Atkins. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  It looked pretty bad.  I took that Virgin America out there, the airline.  I loved that.  You like it, right?  Yeah.  It was with the bed seats.  They weren't the bed seats, but they were the full layback recline seats.  Those are the white ones, the white leather ones.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's different than the bed ones, but fucking great.  JetBlue's getting a first class now.  Yep.  Wish I knew that was coming sooner or later.  They were smart.  Yeah, absolutely.  The airlines were scared of them. 
[00:47:00]  The other airlines were fucking scared of JetBlue, man, because they're run by a guy  who really knows the business.  Yeah.  And now they have a frequent flyer program.  They're doing all the shit that the majors are doing.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I always liked JetBlue.  Yeah, they're great.  I just didn't like the fact that they didn't have first class.  I have to fly a certain way to suit my lifestyle, and that is first class.  Nothing better than watching the people file in past you when you've already been sitting  there, already sipping a beverage, and they have to stop because some idiot in fucking 
[00:47:30]  aisle 20 is putting his overhead bag in, so it stops them.  Yeah, but I mean, who wants to spend more time on a plane?  That's great.  I like first class, but I don't have to fly it.  Yes, you do.  I know I do.  I just wanted to sound humble.  What's worse than when you're reading the paper and you hear, hey, big fan, are you?  Then leave me alone!  And then he goes, I'm talking to Bob Saget behind you.  He's talking to Nicholas Cage. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, so he's talking to Nicholas Cage.  Or if it was a scene in the movie, he'd actually just pull out a big fan, and I was just describing  what I bought.  That was actually you talking to Nicholas Cage.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Huh?  Uh-huh.  He apparently takes pictures with everyone else in public except Jimmy.  He can't take a picture fast enough.  He's fucking Frank Photograph.  I read some tweet where somebody had a picture, and they said, Nicholas Cage, we saw Nick Cage  in the airport. 
[00:48:30]  He walked up and asked if he could take a picture with us.  He actually wanted to take a picture.  That's his Barack and Michelle-O.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We'll get back into Anthony in Vegas after the break.  We still got to talk about the gambling and some other things, right?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  We got a guy that used to have a big, huge, giant scrotum coming in today, right? 
[00:49:00]  The big ball guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't wait to meet him.  His scrotum weighed, what, 132 pounds, I want to say?  Yeah.  Wow.  Jesus.  So...  Did we see the special?  We didn't get it, did we?  No, but he's promoting the special on his whole ordeal.  Jesus.  And I also want to remind the people, our pal, Patrice O'Neal, who's no longer with us,  obviously.  His latest album, Unreleased, is out tomorrow on CD.  Oh, is it tomorrow?  And iTunes.  I think his new website launches tomorrow, too.  Yes. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, great.  Yes.  And then our podcast, the Opie and Anthony podcast, number 14.  We didn't really get to promote it because we were on vacation.  It's out there.  14.  And this one has Joe Rogan.  Talking about what?  Not sure.  Do you know E-Rock offhand?  What bit did we pick?  I don't.  Okay.  And then I requested that we put Papa Rock on there with him fiddling and driving Jimmy  nuts with his fiddling.  The fiddling.  He was just trying to tune his guitar. 
[00:50:00]  He tuned it for like an hour straight.  I don't know.  You know, Jimmy, I'm this guy fiddling.  Yeah, exactly.  Wouldn't stop fiddling.  Just wouldn't stop fiddling and it was driving Jimmy nuts.  It's Joe Rogan talking with Dr. Kaku about mushrooms.  Oh, nice.  And the development of mankind.  Oh, very cool.  I do remember that.  Nice.  Rogan smokes a good amount of pot.  You think?  Him and the fucking red band before the taping went out and really.  And I would have left the room, but Joe's like, no, no, we'll go outside.  And man, did they smoke some pot. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  And came back in.  And I just.  But you almost can't tell.  It just seems fun.  And I can't do it.  I won't do it.  But God damn it.  I understand why people.  Like, I wouldn't be Joe Rogan and I wouldn't be Kevin Smith.  I'd be fucking Pete Paranoid in the corner.  I can't broadcast.  I'm too scared.  I'm too scared.  You'd be frightened.  I don't know how they do it.  Yeah.  I succumbed to peer pressure when I did Rogan's podcast.  And I did, like I said, a little baby hit.  And even that scared the shit out of me. 
[00:51:00]  I'm like, it's going to change my entire personality.  That's it, right?  But he was smoking like a mother.  And I couldn't tell the difference, really.  Not much.  Yeah.  Some of them stoners are pretty damn good at it.  They're good, right?  Yeah.  So Rogan's on our latest podcast.  That'll help the numbers.  Podcast number 14.  Go get it.  And what's the nugget?  It's nugget, Sal.  Sal nugget.  Oh, Sal.  The nugget is I like turtles.  It's a quick nugget.  A quick Opie and Anthony nugget at the end of the podcast. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  See, told you we had sponsors.  And now back to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yo, what up?  This is Mac Lamore.  And I want to give a special shout out to Opie, who just discovered our music, even though  it's been out for a year.  He'll be on top of things, bro.  Can we go back?  This is the moment.  Tonight is the night. 
[00:52:00]  We'll fight till it's over.  So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us.  Like the ceiling can't hold us.  Can we go back?  This is the moment.  Tonight is the night.  We'll fight till it's over.  So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us.  All right.  What did I miss?  I was talking to Anthony about shit.  Yeah, I didn't hear you.  I didn't hear that either.  What happened, E-Rock?  What did I miss?  I heard there's something before this.  Your buddy Macklemore left a little message for you.  Oh, he was in the building? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Did he explain why it's a big deal to fucking try to fucking put your hands up through the  roof or whatever the hell he's trying to say?  No, but he had heard that you recently discovered their music.  Not recently.  He left a little message for you.  I'll replay it again here for you.  All right.  Yeah.  Let me hear this.  Yo, what up?  This is Macklemore, and I want to give a special shout out to Opie, who just discovered our  music, even though it's been out for a year.  It'll be on top of things, bro. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Whoops.  All right.  That's pretty cool, though.  Stupid pop music.  I'm starting to listen to pop music now.  Uh-oh.  Wow.  That's just dumb, catchy shit.  It does get stuck in your head, but man, you've got to get it out of there.  You know, the summer hit, which is Blurred Lines, whatever.  That fucking song's catchy.  Yeah.  Then you're embarrassed that you listen to this shit.  I don't know. 
[00:53:30]  Did you hear any of the songs that were leaked during the vacation?  Like what?  New Lady Gaga, new Katy Perry.  How are they?  I'm not too sure about the Katy Perry, but the Lady Gaga one's going to be big just because  it's Lady Gaga.  We hear it?  Yeah.  Isn't she taking over, like, where is she today?  GMA.  I think she's taking over Times Square today.  There should be thousands of people outside this building right now.  Are there?  I don't know.  I was doing, oh, I did Kevin and Bean. 
[00:54:00]  Did you really?  They're really cool guys, man.  They were really fucking nice dudes, and a fun show.  Nice.  Going into their building, Lady Gaga was coming in to do, like, one of the hit stations that  was in that building, and we pulled in, and there was only 20 people outside.  It wasn't like a big gathering like it would have been a couple years ago, unless it was  a completely secret thing.  Like, Katy Perry did emergency appearances on Monday at, like, Z100 here at Hits One, just 
[00:54:30]  went around the city because somebody leaked their music last Saturday.  Oh, so she had a, like, hey!  So her and Lady Gaga went out, like, immediately to promote that it was out.  There are a ton of people out here for Katy Perry.  Is she bigger than Gaga?  Right now?  Yeah.  Well, I'm no Sam Roberts.  Oh.  So I can't answer that question, but I would say so, yeah.  Well, let's hear their new songs.  Okay.  You want to hear Lady Gaga?  Surprise me.  You got them?  Okay.  Lady Gaga, by the way, she's genius at getting these little monsters or whatever to buy her  song multiple times because she's offering some sort of, like, meet and greet or something. 
[00:55:00]  If you, like, tweet, like, screen caps of, like, hey, I bought your song, and you can  do it as many times as you want.  Oh, my God.  So you can buy her song as many times as you want to get more entries into this, like,  contest that she's having.  Oh, my God.  It's brilliant.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Jeez.  That's some clicks.  Bilking her monsters.  It's called Applause.  I stand here waiting for you to bang us. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  What is she?  Sounds like fucking.  Whoa.  Sounds like a black broad.  Oh.  From the 80s.  She was a draught.  Androgynous.  Grace Jones.  Grace Jones.  Grace Slick.  Oh, Grace Jones.  Grace Jones.  A little bit.  I don't know.  Beat's good.  Applause.  Applause.  Applause.  Oh, this is the same fucking song. 
[00:56:00]  It's following the formula.  It's going to be fine.  Right?  Absolutely.  This is just another fucking...  All right.  Beat you, Chick.  I like Lady Gaga.  You like the guys? 
[00:56:30]  I do.  It's catchy as all hell.  Yeah.  It's not too good to look at.  I love her, man.  I don't know, man.  It's got a juicy little vagina.  She cleans up really nice, but when you take half that shit away, she's kind of homely.  I think.  All right.  What about Katy Perry?  And her.  I like this.  Does she sing from the tits?  Does she sing from the tits?  A lot of people are saying that she ripped this song off from some other girl who she 
[00:57:00]  actually tweeted the song like months ago.  That she liked it?  That she liked it.  What?  What?  Yeah.  Listen to the song that...  Sarah Borrelias.  Borrelias.  Yeah.  So we'll listen to this one.  You can listen to this one.  Oh, controversy.  How could you tell this also sounds like every other song? 
[00:57:30]  It's good, but do you have the original that they said?  It's close.  Is there a hook?  Dancing through the fire, cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roll.  She's got a very powerful voice, doesn't she, Eric?  Yeah.  You know a bit about vocals.  She does.  Yeah.  That's pretty strong.  You're gonna hear me roll. 
[00:58:00]  Almost effortless, too.  Cause she sings from the tits.  Are you going to hear me roll?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Go ahead there, Travis.  Oh.  Oh, come on.  Oh, boy.  Travis, we need it.  Total ripoff.  Oh.  Yeah, but this version has over 4 million, 4.5 million views, because it's the ripoff.  I have Katy Perry's song layered over this.  Which one do you want to hear it afterwards? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, it's very close.  If somebody's lack of love, or you can start speakin' up.  Nothing's gonna hurt you the way the words do, and they settle need to stand.  Yeah, that's the same fuckin' cadence.  If to me inside, and no sunlight, sometimes the shadow wins.  Sorry, honey.  Ha, ha, ha.  Sorry, that toots.  Oh, she's gonna make a nice dime. 
[00:59:00]  Can we hear the other one real quick?  Do you just want to hear it layered over this?  Or no, just the other one, like, right after, a half a second later.  That's close, dude.  That is.  That's just not famous, because she's homely.  She's gotta...  Oh, Jesus.  Wow, she's fucked.  She's gonna get so soon.  Why would she do that?  Especially in this day and age. 
[00:59:30]  You can't get away with any of that shit.  Here, let's listen to them layered on top of this.  I didn't think it would be...  They're both playing at the same time right now?  Get the fuck out of here.  And I put my turn straight into my mind and make a love.  So I feel like I'm shy.  I can't reach the lies of me.  I guess that I forgot I had a choice.  I let you push me past the breaking point.  I said something from a her chain.  Watch that for everything. 
[01:00:00]  You had me down to me in the sun.  Oh, he's gonna shut up.  You hear my voice, you hear that sound.  I won't like when you're gonna have to live.  Take me down, but I can't stop  Get ready, cause I can't stop  I think it all  I think it all  I got the eye of the fire  Cause you wanna stay  Through the fire and storm  I am a jam  I'm a jam  I'm a jam 
[01:00:30]  I'm a jam  I'm a jam  I'm a jam  I'm a jam  I'm a jam  I'm a jam  I'm a jam  The same song  Oh my god, I hate it  It is, yeah  Holy shit  Why would she do that?  What's her explanation? 
[01:01:00]  I don't think she's said anything  She hasn't said anything  Sarah tweeted a classy response  All love everybody, all love  That doesn't say I won't sue  It's also rote  It's also rote  Love to sue  Yeah, exactly  All love, everybody  All love doesn't pay the bills  What's wrong with this broad?  Oh, she'll fucking  Don't settle something quietly  You'll be hearing from my lawyer  Are the lyrics similar or not really?  No  No, it's just the whole cadence  Oh, dude  It's so fucking similar 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, that's it  It's over Johnny  I guess Ashton Kutcher's got a bomb on his hands, huh?  Well with Jobs  Yeah, Jobs came in seventh place  Did better than  Indiana Jones  Did that not do good?  No, what's his name?  Harrison Ford  Harrison Ford's movie  I don't even know what he's in

[01:26:00]  It is the best  They invented it  So they're rich  But they're rednecks  They're bloody rich  Why are they rich?  They invented the duck call  And it's the best one  Oh you don't mean  They do it their mouth  They invented an item  Yeah  How would you determine  I guess  Whichever one has  More ducks show up  Yes  A bunch of ducks  Are knocking at their door  Like if you do it  A bunch of flies come  You're like  That's the wrong pitch  Can we hear it?  Sure I guess  I don't know  What a duck call  Sounds like  I invented one  Just imagine  What a duck sounds like  It was just like  Hey Daffy

[01:28:00]  I've worked on that  He's the one  That makes sure  The sound  Of ducks in the wild  Is mimicked  To perfection  Once you get  That sound  That's good  You got it  People are always  Fascinated by  The sounds we make  On our wood duck call  Because they're thinking  Well how did you  Come up with that  And I'm thinking  What do you mean  How'd I come up with it  I heard wood ducks  Doing it  I just listened to them  Made the call  To replicate  The sounds that I was hearing  It'll take probably  Two or three minutes  On each call  But you gotta think 
[01:28:30]  We make like  Holy shit  That's a lot of minutes  That's a lot of  Fucking duck calls  They're shipping out  That's a lot of  Massacred  Fucking fat  Happy  Trusting ducks  They're not easy  Enough to kill  They have no  Natural defense  They make that noise  Mark  Here I am  Mark  Here I am  Mark  Fucking lazy asshole  You gotta have the duck  Come to you  To murder it  Holy shit  Why don't you send out  A duck tour boss

[01:31:30]  And shot some of those  Automatic weapons  Out there in Vegas  Oh you did that  How awesome was that  That was pretty  God damn awesome  Yeah  I would have loved  To see your face  You probably like  Those two parking  Attentions  In Ferris Bueller's day off  When they go over that hill  Yes  Yeah  It's just  Something fun  About shooting  Automatic weapons  I don't know what it is  But it is fun  It's good  You know who's into that stuff  I saw on  One of those shows 
[01:32:00]  I'm the worst  I don't know the name  Of the actor  He was on  I think it was  Freaks and Geeks  Or Undeclared  Yeah  The nerdiest looking guys ever  He was in that  Ah Jesus  I'm the worst  That Tarantino movie  Where they killed  All the Nazis  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Oh that was  He was in that too  Now I guess  Because all the guns  He shot in that one  He's like a full on  Gun nut  He lost his mind  Yeah  No he didn't lose his mind 
[01:32:30]  They were like  They were kind of  Looking at him  Like why are you  Into guns  And he's like this  And he's like  I don't know  Because they're  They're kind of awesome  He had this big grin  On his face  Shooting him  Or whatever  So that's my  First awful story  Bill  Bill are you going to be  In the finale of Glee  In the finale of Glee  Oh yeah  Yeah  Dancing shirtless  In the cafeteria  Holy fuck  No I'm not  That's a running joke 
[01:33:00]  I do on my podcast  Oh wow  You got E-Rock  How could E-Rock  E-Rock possibly think that  E-Rock goes  Bill was in New Orleans  New Orleans  Filming the finale of Glee  He sings a song  He said it on his podcast  Hey Bill  Are you the actor  Who killed himself on Glee  You're dumb Eric  Oh my god  Oh okay  No I actually  I just use that  As a running joke  Whenever I get acting work  Because you never know  If you're still going to be in it  By the time  By the time they  By the time they edit it  You don't know  If you're still going to be in it 
[01:33:30]  So I don't tell anybody  I'm in anything  Until it comes out  But  I can't tell you  I'm telling you  I'm shooting a movie  Called Black and White  And tomorrow's my last day  Who's in that one  Kevin Costner  Octavia Spencer  And  A whole host  Of other people  Wow  Goddamn Burr  Fucking Burr  Goddamn Bill  You're just the opposite of me  Like you don't tell people  You're in something  Until it comes out  I just tell everyone  I'm in shit  And lie  And they cut me out of that 
[01:34:00]  I had a big scene  Hey how's Kevin Costner  You get to talk to him at all  Oh yeah  Yeah  No he's awesome  He's a good guy right  Yeah he's a great guy  Yeah pretty much I think  Everybody at this point  Because there's so few films left  I think if you were a dick  You got the  You got the  Heave ho  Yeah  Everybody that I've been running into  Is  It's cool as hell  Yeah he's one of those guys  Like  You know  When it comes around  To his point of view  You know  He's always there  Like  He doesn't 
[01:34:30]  Walk off the shed  Like  I did my  I have a stand and come in  He like totally  Oh yeah yeah  Goes out of his way  To make sure  You know  You got somebody to look at  You know  As opposed to  Some of the nightmares  That I've heard  Where you got  You're staring at a piece of tape  And they go away  And they leave  Back to their trailer  That piece of tape right there  Just look at them  And  Oh my god  Shit  Movie magic  Jesus  Hey Bill  Are you in any more  Breaking Bad? 
[01:35:00]  Unfortunately  I think that that one  Might have been it  I don't know  I don't think that I'm also  Allowed to say  Oh who's kidding who  I killed Walt  I end up with all the money  And I end up having  A better formula  What a great line that was  He opened a car wash  That was a great line  Where  Your buddy there  Goes yeah  Mexico  That's  That's all I'm saying  You know  And you're like 
[01:35:30]  Yeah  Ten guys dead  In a two minute window  That's all I'm saying  Oh yeah  She was great  That's Lavelle Crawford  Another stand up comic  That's what's so cool  About Vince Gillian  Is he  The reason why  I'm getting acting work  Is because  He  Took a chance  You know  Of putting me on there  So then I finally  Then we could kind of like  Lie  Not lie  I just not tell the whole truth  That I also did stand up  Because I feel like  Once you say you're a stand up comic 
[01:36:00]  That really screws you out of  Them  Even entertaining  Bringing you in for a drama  So once we had the  Breaking Bad  Reel  I somehow sandwiched my awful performance  On Law and Order in there too  And I could actually  Do some drama  Yeah  Yeah  And then I got a couple more  So then I had enough  So that's kind of the formula  We do now  We just  If it's a comedy  We'll put the stand up  On the reel  And if it's a drama  And I want to get in there  We take it off  Oh well 
[01:36:30]  Yeah  Shit yeah  And now you got  Boy you got that good  Breaking Bad shit  For your reel now  God damn it  I know right  I know  And acting with Pacino  And shit  Jesus  Unbelievable  I know  My IMD page  Is a quick read  But I paratrooped  Into a lot of good stuff  Paratrooped  No that's literally  What it is  Yeah yeah  They  I don't know  I don't know how  How the hell  It finally  You know it's funny 
[01:37:00]  People go  Hey you know  Is it just now  That you've wanted  To start acting  It's like  Nah I've been trying  I've been trying right along  Maybe you do have to  Move out to LA  Jesus Christ  For 20 years  But hey  I was also calling  To whore myself out  If that's okay  Of course  Absolutely  I got a  Tickets go on sale  For  We added a show  At the  At the Beacon  So the second show  Goes on  Holy shit  Fuck  I just saw that  When I walked by yesterday 
[01:37:30]  That you were there  I was walking by for lunch  And I see Wanda one night  And you the next  Holy  Bill Burr  At the Beacon  Nice  Yeah  And a second show now  Yep  And I'm gonna save  All the money everybody  I don't know how long  This is gonna work  Holy fuck  Nice brother  When's it on sale  It actually goes on sale today  Okay  So  We shall  We'll see  We'll see  Hold on  Two nights  At the Beacon  That's awesome  Are you doing two nights  Or are you doing a late show

[01:38:30]  Smell that's holding  Was it as awful  As it sounds  No  It was kind of  Look at these  Light fixtures  When I tell my  Ditch  To this casino  These are the best  Light fixtures  To stand underneath  No  It was good  It was actually  Very funny man  Oh  Good deal  Well  I'm hoping  I'm hoping  I get back  Before  Before November 
[01:39:00]  But  If not  I'll just keep  I'll just keep  Calling in  With my mediocre  Stories  Hey Bill  I gotta ask you  About A-Rod  You're a big  Baseball guy  You gotta be  Loving this shit  Huh  Yeah  I was enjoying it  Right up until  Everybody started  Booing him  I'm such a contrarian  Once everyone  Started booing him  Now I'm just  Rooting for him  He hit a home run  Every time  I just look in the crowd  Like  Oh look at this guy  You're not cheating  On your taxes 
[01:39:30]  And literally  I'm such a  Hypocritical piece of shit  The day before  I'm sitting there  Railing  And going  You know  It's a Yankee  They're not gonna  Suspend him  And then they give him  The biggest suspension ever  And then literally  Within 24 hours  He got beaned  Last night  That was a dumb move  Yeah  I don't watch  Much baseball anymore 
[01:40:00]  I kind of tapped out  What it was like  Three years ago  When Ortiz  Maybe tested positive  For something  I just got fed up  With it  I was just  Yeah  It's like look  Either get him  Out of the game  Or make him legal  But I'm sick of  Cheering on  On things  That four years later  You tell me  Don't count  You know  That didn't really count  You know  All the excitement you had  And we'll still let you  Keep the trophy  But uh  Yeah  All that excitement  Everyone was all  Loided up  Or maybe they weren't  And then you start 
[01:40:30]  And then you start  Looking at guys  Who are actually  Playing well  And you're really thinking  Well they gotta be  They gotta be juicing  Right  Right  Now  Yeah  The second anyone  Plays well  And there's the guy  On juice  So  I still love the game  Like I actually was  I watched a little bit  Of the Red Sox game  Last night  But who's kidding me  This time of year  Your choices at that  Are like arena football  So  I do like the way  That the Yankees  Just kind of jogged  Slowly toward the infield  After A-Rod got hit  And the dugout  They just kind of like 
[01:41:00]  Looked up a little  No one flying out  Of the fucking dugout  That's what we said  Before the show  That's why A-Rod  Didn't you know  Yeah  Didn't charge the mound  Or anything  He didn't charge the mound  Because he wasn't sure  Come on guys  Let's get up  No one follows  He wasn't sure  His guy would be behind him  He just stood there  With that stupid look  On his face  Hate that look  I gotta tell you though  Watching the Yankees  Trying to figure out  How to get out  Of that contract  And how A-Rod  Just won't let him  It's been one of my  Favorite things  And it's really fun  To watch  They've tried to 
[01:41:30]  Humiliate him  And they pulled him  Out of  They benched him  In like ninth inning  Of a playoff game  Last year  Basically in front of  You know  The whole country  Because everybody  Who's into baseball  Is watching  And they're like  Did it bug me  He's like  Nope  Didn't bug me  I mean  They're gonna do it  Best for the team  Bye  See you tomorrow  Pay me  Serves them fucking right man  I'm happy that they're  Taking a beating on that  It's like  Enough with the big  Fucking name  Waste of time  Not develop a young talent  I'm really happy  That they're gonna  Fucked with A-Rod  Yeah  Oh you know 
[01:42:00]  What about the Dodgers  I was psyched last year  When they bought off  You know  The Red Sox  Became the Yankees  Somewhere between  2004 and 2007  We've done the exact  Same thing  Buying everybody  In the league  And when we  We dumped like  That hundred million dollars  Worth of guys  Who weren't doing shit  For us  And they just  The Dodgers  Picked them up  I'm like  And then they weren't  Playing well  And it's like  Why the fuck  Do you think  Because they put on  A different uniform  All of a sudden  They're gonna be good  And now they actually are  Yeah  They're killing it out there  Dodgers are just  Ripping it up  Holy fuck 
[01:42:30]  Well they should  They bought a hundred  Million dollars worth  Of guys  Right  That's another reason  Why I don't like  Baseball  It's just like  They just go out  And they buy their  Ways out of problems  And they keep saying  The Yankees are good  If the Dodgers are good  If the Red Sox are good  It's good for baseball  I don't think it is  When you look at the NFL  You know  Is it bad for the NFL  Is Green Bay is good  They're in the middle  Of nowhere  True  Wow  You know what  Anthony  Thank you for that

I uh  I'm walking carrying this orange hoodie here  Yeah  Because it's a symbol  Oh  It's a symbol of 
[02:04:00]  What I used to have to wear for a pair of pants  Yeah you used to have  I saw the pictures  And it's you know  What do you mean?  You had to wear sweatpants you mean?  No no  No no  This is an actual sweat jacket  You know it's a hoodie  Hooded sweat jacket  That uh  You know I realized  In Las  I realized in Las Vegas  Okay  I realized in Las Vegas  That  I had a closet full of  Hooded sweat jackets 
[02:04:30]  Um  Being from New Jersey originally  And I'm out in Las Vegas  Where there's no use for  Hooded sweat jackets  And I was trying to figure out  What in the world could I use  To put on for a pair of pants  When I have to go out  To the bank  When I have to go out to the store  To a doctor's appointment  And I couldn't find anything  To wear  Because my 200  Well at the time  My testicle sack  Was about 100 pounds  Oh my goodness  Instead of 200  When it was on the day  Of the surgery  On April 8th 
[02:05:00]  Of this year  And I'm taking a look  At these jackets  That I have in there  And these  And I said  You know what  I wonder  If I can just  Sort of like  Pin up the hood  So it doesn't drag  In the ground  And if I can  Turn this upside down  And stick my legs  Through the sleeves  Through the armholes  And then actually  I can have use in Las Vegas  For my hooded sweat jacket  So actually  The hood  You were wearing the hood  Over your scrotum  Uh yeah  Like that would like 
[02:05:30]  Upside down  Right upside down  Well I would pin up the hood  Uh huh  Actually because  It would  I would have to  Pin  Turn it down  Oh my god  Right right right  And  Just talking to the legs  So I can make it  Put my legs through  Through the armholes  And this would  And this would be  Upside  Uh huh  This would be upside down  Right  Gotcha  You know  And zip it up  Mother of god  Wow  And that's how I did  The  You know  I didn't know  They had an orange couch 
[02:06:00]  In the Howard Stern show  I went in matching the couch  With my orange hoodie  It did  From my original interview  A couple years ago  So this is a symbol  Of something that  I don't have to rely on anymore  Wow  How did you  Like you go into the bank  If your scrotum is that big  How do you sit in the car  Are you sitting on them  Or were you able to manipulate it  So it's kind of in front of you  And you're not crunching  Your own balls  I couldn't ride in the car  For a couple of years  Basically  Wow  After I did the Howard Stern show

[02:21:00]  He  Saying  It  Was  He  Had  To  Be  Giving  You  Some  Kind  Of  A  Diagnosis  As  To  What  Was  Causing  It  Scrotal  Edema  A  Massive  Scrotal  Edema  Which  Basically  You  Edema  Is  Caused  Like  A  Massive  Growth  Which  Is  Brought  On  By  Fluids  And  What  Not  Enlargement  Of  Body  Mass  Tissue  And  So  Basically  Scrotal  Edema  What  They  Wanted  To  Do  When 
[02:21:30]  What  They  Decided  To  Do  Was  To  Put  Me  In  The  Hospital  At  UMC  He  Says  Let's  Figure  Out  Let's  Try  To  See  If  We  Can  Do  Something  For  You  And  So  Basically  What  They  Did  Was  A  Left  Inglinal  Hernia  Operation  On  Me  And  That  Was  After  My  Being  In  Hospital  For  Five  Weeks  And  Multiple  Teams  Of  Doctors  Coming  In  To  Examine  Me  And  And  Look at  Me  As If  It Was  On  Some  Kind  Of 
[02:22:00]  A  Test  Case  Or  Experiment  Or  Something  It  Was  Unbelievable  So  In  The  Fifth  Week  Out  Of  Eight  Weeks  Total  In  The  Hospital  I  Have  This  Surgery  After  Eight  Weeks  I  Am  Crying  As  I'm  Leaving  The  Hospital  Because  I  Had  I  Had  I  Had  A  Bigger  Testicle  Sack  After  Eight  Weeks  Than  I  Had  To  Anything  Yeah  How big was it at this point now um I don't know but it wasn't long too long after I was on the Howard Stern show and they had an actual scale digital scale there for me to weigh the actual testicle sack on and it measured up to went up to the weight was hundred and forty five pounds wow at that 
[02:22:30]  And the skin could stretch that much apparently so apparently so he's right I know I'm amazed by that you would think something I you know it's it's like a kid being amazed by how your penis can go like this to like that when you're fully erect it's like where does all that come about from that let me ask you now would you when you when you would your balls feel solid or did it feel like fluidy when you touch them did it hurt to touch them 
[02:23:00]  Um you know what I it's funny I could I could sit and I could bang on them like a drum  Whoa you know just for the heck of it just to you know maybe show off to somebody that was uh looking at me like oh wow holy shit look at this you know I was like I said you know what I can bang on these things all day long and and and and and and I don't really feel any pain  So that wasn't helping but yet yeah but yet I could punch them I could bang on them but yet don't let me uh just slightly uh touch the uh the edge of a door or the kitchen cap the kitchen um uh cabinet uh door you know if I if that dings me it was like the worst pain 
[02:23:30]  Huh why I don't know it's the weirdest thing uh the door could hit me the the the corner of the of a of a kitchen cabinet you know below the sink could could uh I could hit that hit up against that or it can come out and and hit up against me 
[02:24:00]  Yeah yeah and it's like a very extreme you know painful feeling but I could slap it and bang on the damn thing with my hands and and and and I wouldn't feel that kind of thing  So sex was out of the question  Was it there was no question  Right okay yeah obviously  No no  Crazy question but did you was there any point where you like as a man you get urges did you like were you able to masturbate or ejaculate in that whole time?  I lost I've lost 
[02:24:30]  Okay one of my well the the doctor says I lost all testosterone  Hmm  You know  Yeah I guess it kind of affected uh the the testicles themselves  Too much fluid  When you when you have uh, I don't know  I mean, I I guess I maybe I shouldn't speak for everybody  But I'm just guessing that if you have low testosterone or or no testosterone in your body  Hmm  Um 
[02:25:00]  It's like, you know, the urge to desire just like just  You know disseminate that, you know, it just goes away  You know, and then you can't miss something that you don't have a desire for  Hmm, you know, it's like I guess a lot of guys don't have as much of a desire  For uh, for an old lady they might have had for a wife for 30 years  Right  But some uh, some hot young honey walks by and all of a sudden  You know, it's like  Yeah, if you don't have a desire  Then uh, you know, you don't miss it 
[02:25:30]  Do we at the time this sounds like a weird question  But were your balls themselves bigger or was it just this like the fluid around them with the balls tiny in the middle of all this?  Yeah, exactly  That's a very good question because because the answer is that exactly  The testicles were still there  Inside of the giant mass of uh skin and um  The  Were still sunken inside of the giant body mass 
[02:26:00]  That grew from the testicle sack all around it  So the balls hadn't grown  According to Dr. Gellman  No, I saw a video last night in preparation for all this publicity uh today  Uh to promote the documentary that's coming out tonight at nine o'clock on  TLC eastern and pacific time eight o'clock central time  I think a lot of you mountain time zone  I don't know but I love you salt lake city in denver anyway  But the point is it's called the sorry to interrupt you  It's called the man with the 132 pound scrotum 
[02:26:30]  Which really it sounds like a fucking science fiction film  Yes, but it was actually 200 pounds  Was that title already taken?  Good question because if it wasn't I wish they would have called it that  Because that's what I had to  That's what I had to be inconvenienced hauling hauling around  That's why I had an issue with that title  But you know, I just hope it's a successful documentary nonetheless  And um  I want to finish your answer to your question  Uh when I was taking a look at a video in preparation for all this tonight 
[02:27:00]  See the british version is a little bit more graphic  And so I was looking at them  They the doctor had to operate a couple of hours  A little more than a couple of hours  Before he was able to actually locate the buried testicles  Wow  And he pulls them out  And it was like like you said like a movie  They were like two balls  Uh with a long slimy stem  Uh you know rising from the deep inside of the tissue 
[02:27:30]  Of the sack  You know and he like he holds them up like this  And and and sort of like a baby with an umbilical cord  And it's like attached deep inside there  And uh but they were they were basically the same testicles as I as I've always  Do you still have them or do you have to remove them  No that's that's one that's part of the miracle  Of of of Dr. Joel Gelman's technique  He's only one of about so I've been told 
[02:28:00]  He's only one of about a dozen surgeons in the entire country  That can perform this special type of surgery  Like finding a needle in a haystack  Is finding someone like Dr. Gelman to help somebody like me  And uh he uh he is skilled at at at removing this type of a mass  On someone while saving the penis and the testicles  Damn  My surgery was about 13 hours long  Was your penis just the same or was it just was it was it mushed up on the top 
[02:28:30]  Was there a pressure against it or was it  Well how was your your dick itself  Well originally inside of the ball sack  Okay imagine you know it was a good a giant  Gigantic round beach ball type of  You know skin uh mass growth  And imagine like like a heart  Dipping in the center  Right  Okay  My penis was dipped deep inside of the center 
[02:29:00]  It's like I had like a like a hole  In the center of the front front and center of the ball sack  And that's where the uh urine would stream out of  Whenever I'd have to urinate  Because it was deep inside there  That and it never covered up the head of it  Was that did it was there a smell with this  Was it was it hard to keep clean all this or no  Did you just have to take extra care in the shower  Yeah I just I just  Whenever I whenever I had to use the restroom  I always 
[02:29:30]  Clean myself  Oh yeah  You know I mean I I just  You know constantly uh  Do that  It just seemed like a hard area to get to  I mean it's hard not to get to your back  Much less underneath all that  It just seems like a difficult  Also I had the  The uh the help and attention  Paid to me by a  Home health care attendant  Uh for a while  Every day  Or you know she'd come  And that was part of her duties  You know  Oh can you talk about that  One girl in particular 
[02:30:00]  Oh  Uh named Passion  And uh  Passion  Yes and she looked very  Health care workers  Rock  Yes and she was  Passion  Yes she was  Yeah  Yes she was  Yes she looked like she  Would come over to my home  After having uh  You know gotten off  Of a strip club pole  Oh  And I tell you  And she came over  With her special technique  Of knowing how to  Tend properly  To Warren's testicle sack  Believe me  Wow  And uh  You know you just  If you can't do it yourself  You gotta have somebody 
[02:30:30]  Come in and do it  Do it because uh  You know  I didn't want it to get  Any worse  Than it already was  Due to uh  Proper hygiene  Right  Yeah yeah  So they  They they finally  How do you get to  This surgeon  Because obviously  The first time you go  To the hospital  You said for eight weeks  It's it's bigger  When you leave  And is there a point  Like when do you start  To realize this is hopeless  It's not gonna ever happen  Or start to feel that way  Well  Uh 
[02:31:00]  There was a point  That I was  Basically given  No hope  And so  I'm like  Wait a minute  Come on now  This is ridiculous  I was depressed  For five minutes  And then I said  There's gotta be an answer  There's gotta be an answer  There's gotta be an answer  There's gotta be a solution  And I'm  Kind of getting tired of it  As I get older  But I'm pretty good  At solving  Problems  Or finding the right person

[02:33:30]  And only then  Will we  Make an appointment  For you  To see one  Of our  Physicians  To then  Treat you  Or give you  An initial  Examination  So the  Initial examination  Was not  Possible for me  Unless I would  Post $25,000  And she said  As you would  Need care  From the  Very first  Exam  We will  Deduct the  Cost of  Whatever  Oh okay  That's not a 
[02:34:00]  Feed just to  Meet with them  They take it  Off  I thought  That goes  Pretty quick  Though  Yeah yeah  Yeah sure  Five large  At the  Mayo Clinic  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  So I knew  They were  On the  Out as far  As far as  An option  For me  Right  Yeah  Okay  Oh shoot  Okay  So  They're  They're out  There  Maybe there  Are others  Out there  That I'm  Just not  Finding  So I  Thought  You know  What  Let me  Put my  25 years  Or so  Of listening  To the  Howard Stern  Show  To good 
[02:34:30]  Use  I said  You know  I'm going  To call  And find  Out somehow  How to  Get  The number  To the  Back office  And just  And get  Whatever numbers  I can  Affiliated with  Sirius  Satellite Radio  At the time  It wasn't  Sirius XM  Because now  You've just  Got to get  The information  Out there  Get your name  Out there  I've got to  Find out  And find someone  That could help  You out  Who in  That Stern  Show  Office  Would be  Willing to  Talk to me  Know my story  And see if  They would be  Interested  In a meeting 
[02:35:00]  In putting  Me on the show  So I can  Get the word  Out that  I'm looking  For a  Specialist  Of all  Specialists  Right  You know  And anybody  Out there  You know  That could be  Of assistance  You know  If I don't  Have the  Insurance  To cover  You know  Maybe some  Rich charity  Maybe some  Generous celebrity  All I need  Is one  You know  So I figured  The male audience  Listening  Which is pretty  Much male  Listening to  A show  Like the  Stern 
[02:35:30]  Show  Is bigger  Than male  And female  Audience  Of Letterman  And Leno  Put together  I says  And if anybody  Is going to  Understand my  Plight  And sympathize  With me  And maybe  Want to help  Or offer  Advice  Or  Contributions  Or whatever  It's going to be  A male audience  That  Doesn't want to  That can identify  With me  And will not  Want to be  In the position  That I'm  Suffering  That I'm in  So I wound up  Surprisingly 
[02:36:00]  They were interested  Surprisingly  No I think  That's pretty  Predictable  They flew me  They flew me in  Let me ask you  The plane  You get on the plane  How do you sit  On the plane  How does this  How do you get  Gigantic testicles  Onto the plane  Well you know  Like I said  I'm pretty much  I try to be  Pretty good  At being a  Problem solver  And I thought  Of the possible  Logistics of this  I contacted  The TSA  I contacted  The person  That would be  Testicle storage 
[02:36:30]  Association  I believe it  I contacted  Flyer passenger  Services  At McCarran  International Airport  I said listen  I don't want you guys  To think I have  A problem  McCarran  That's a great name  McCarran's  Some big balls  You need to put him  Somewhere  Yeah  I don't want to  Have any problem  Going through security  And I'm going to  Probably need a  Special seat  On JetBlue Airlines  For you know  I said  What can you guys  Do for me 
[02:37:00]  And they  Coordinated everything  So you show up there  Is there a special  Line for you to go  Is it embarrassing  Or are you beyond that  I show up there  The head of  The head of  The airport  Head  TSA  I forgot what  TSA stands for  Right now  But the head  Of the TSA  Was there  Some other  Airport  Highfalutin  Person was there  Everyone with  A cell phone  Camera  And a wheelchair  Waiting for me  And we  Zoomed by  Everybody  We're now  Boarding our  Premier customers 
[02:37:30]  Those in  First class  And those with  Giant balls  Luckily I was  Barely able to  The bigger problem  Other than the seat  Okay  Because they had  Plenty of leg room  For me  I had a seat  And then some  For the open seat  Next to me  They were  Very accommodating  Didn't have to  The Stern Show folks  Did not have to  Pay for two seats  For me  You know  But the bigger  Problem was  I was hoping  That I would not 
[02:38:00]  Have to use  The bathroom  Oh man  Those bathrooms  Are just  A little bit  Tiny  It's a small  Bathroom  Yeah  So it  Happened  You know  I'm like  We're flying  We're flying  We're flying  I caught the  Red eye  On purpose  Less people  Yeah  Caught the red eye  So I could  Maximize my time  In New York  You know  And plus  I could sleep  On the plane  But I woke up  Too soon  Wait you could  Sleep on the plane  With 180 pound testicles  And I can't fall asleep 
[02:38:30]  In first class  Jesus you're amazing  Dude  Yes  Yes  And I woke up  Too soon  I wake up  And on the TV  In front of me  It says  News 4  Like I said  I'm originally  From here  So I said  News 4  Oh we must  Not be too far  You know  We're within  We're within  Range of  Picking up  Channel 4 news  On the TV  Yeah  Don't work like that  I says  To the  Flight attendant  I says 
[02:39:00]  I said  Well are we  Fairly close  To landing  Are we on  Schedule  For landing  And you know  On time  In JFK  And she says  Oh yes  Well we'll be  Arriving in about  An hour and a half  I said  Excuse me  I had to use  The restroom  Then  And I was  Trying to wait  Oh man  So up I go  Oh no  I squeezed  You know  I was  Like a few  Couple of hours  Clunking people  On the head  How could you 
[02:39:30]  And I'm lifting  The testicle  And  A guitar  An airplane  And I get  The door open  There  A little door  Open  And I'm  And I'm  Like literally  Squeezing  Oh wow  And I was  Like where's  The gigantic  Jar of Vaseline  I need to  Slip  Oh my god  You know  Wow  And I get  Into the restroom  And  And I lift  The lid  Onto the toilet  And it wasn't  And the door  Wouldn't close 
[02:40:00]  Oh wow  My ass was  Keeping the door  Open  So  Finally  I was able  To get myself  Forward  And  And I did not  Want my  Testicle sack  To touch that  Toilet  And I was  Trying to  Hold it  Up  And but  You know  But once I  Got over  The hole  Of the  Toilet  That's when  The bathroom  Door closed  Right on my  Ass  Because I  Finally made  Enough room  For it to  Close  But from  That trip  Forward 
[02:40:30]  The testicle  Sack got  Too big  For me  To be able  To take  Any other  Flights  Because I  Would not  Be able  To fit  Into the  Bathroom  On the  Plane  Unbelievable  You see  Because I  You know  There was a  Doctor in  Greece that  Came with  High praise  Dr.  Prokopakis  Another  Needle in the  Haystack  But you  You know  You've got  To fly to  New York  And even  They put  Me up  Overnight  Here  There's about  Another  What  Ten hour  Flight  Or whatever  Six hour  Flight 
[02:41:00]  To London  Then I got  To fly to  Athens  I said  I'll never  Be able to  Do all  This  Can't do it  So luckily  Dr.  Joel  Gellman  Was found  For me  And I was  Able to  Hop in a  Van that  Was provided  For me  And with  My milk  Crates  And giant  Pillow  And the  Center seat  Pulled out  So I could  Have plenty  Of leg room  And I  Could help  Me with  These testicles  Would you  Wow 
[02:41:30]  To go to  From southern  California  Which is  You know  And stop  At a rest  Stop or  Wherever along  The way  Sure  You know  Without having  To deal with  Any kind of  Plane travel  So that's  One advantage  Of going  To Orange  County  To see  Dr.  Joel  Gellman  Rather than  Going over  To  Greece  Yeah  When you  Finally get  The surgery  And you  Wake up  How much  Smaller  Is your  Scrotum  I guess  He cut  All that  Extra skin  Away  Exactly 
[02:42:00]  But you  Know  There's  In the  Aftermath  Starting about  A few weeks  Later  You know  There's some  Kind of  A little  Bit of  Water retention  A little bit  Of a water  Retention  Growth there  And  So there's  Some  Rough  Inflated  Skin  Around  The penis  Area  And  That has  To be  Taken  Care  Of  In a  Surgery  That dr.  Gellman  Wants  To do  Within  The course 
[02:42:30]  Of the  Next few  Weeks  You know  But it's  It's  Expensive  For me  To go  To and  From  Southern  California  Three  Four hundred  Dollars  Every time  I go  You know  And luckily  I can  Drive  Now  But a  Rental  Car  Is not  Free  The hotel  Is not  Free  You know  And  But I  Gotta go  Have this  Surgery  Done  First  Follow  Up  Surgery  Like  If you  Imagine  A hot  Dog  Like a  Pig in  A  Blanket  Sure  I  Enjoy  Them  A  Great  Deal  At  Parties  Well 
[02:43:00]  Imagine  That  You know  Yeah  You didn't  Realize  That  That's  Part of  The  Unique  Wonderful  Humor  Of this  Program  Yes  Of course  So  You know  It's a little  Bit more  Humorous  Than what  Will be  On the  Documentary  9 o'clock  TLC  But anyway  Eight o'clock  Central  But the  Thing about  It is  That the  The penis  You know 
[02:43:30]  After recovery  Is full  In about a  Year  Will probably  It has been  Expected that  The penis  Will be back  To normal  Size  It will be  Exposed  Back to  Normal  Exposed  And back  To normal  Size  But at  This particular  Stage  It's only  About  It was only  It was only  About an  Inch  Oh man  But the  Thing about  It  Wow  It  A hardened  Sort of like  A silly  Putty  Type of  Substance  Skin  Rather  With fluid  Causing 
[02:44:00]  Caused  By fluid  Retention  Grew  Around  That  Oh wow  And it  Grew up  And then  Around  To whereby  The head  Is only  Exposed  By  Like it's  Circumcised  Again almost  Right  Or uncircumcised  Like it's  Uncircumcised  And I'm not  Used to  Being uncircumcised  But this  Is  Like I'm  Uncircumcised  With  With the  Penis  Inside  And it's  Got that  Little hole  About the  Size of  Of an  Eraser  Head  Opening  Right now  And I'm  Afraid 
[02:44:30]  That that's  Going to  Close up  And the  Slit of  The penis  Is going  To be  Closed up  And  But I've  Been having  Urination  Problems  Anyway  They pull  The catheter  Out  Incorrectly  And I  Had to  Go to  The emergency  Room  A few  Weeks  Ago  About a  Month  Ago  Because I  Could  Not  My body  Kept  Trying to  Urinate  Every  Ten  Minutes  I felt  Like my  Bladder  Was going  To burst  And nothing  Was coming  Out  Nothing  For five  Hours  You have  To have  This other  Surgery  Now  Where they  Can  Kind of  Relieve  That  I have a  Narrowing  Of the  Urethra  Or what 
[02:45:00]  They call  A urethra  Stricture  Which is  Dr.  Joel  Gelman's  Specialty  It's only  13-14  Hour  Surgery  I had  Before  But  Dr.  Gelman  Says  This is  A more  Delicate  Far more  Difficult  Surgery  Than the  Longer  One  Was  Does he  Have to  Go in  Through  The hole  He doesn't  Slice  Your dick  Open  Does he  Go through  The hole  Of the  Penis  He  Slices  The  What would  Be  The blanket 
[02:45:30]  Of the  Blanket  Of the  Pig  In a  Blanket  He  Would  Slice  The  Blanket  That  Is  The  Silly  Putty  Around  It  Right  And get  Has to  Also  Go inside  Of the  Penis  To  Repair  The  The  The  The  The  Where  Where  Where  The  Where  The passageway  Has been  Narrowed  So  Luckily  I don't  Have to  Be awake  For any  Of that  Yeah  That would  Be awful
