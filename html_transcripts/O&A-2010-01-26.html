<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts envisioning a "Shit Radio" experience and excitedly anticipating the upcoming visit of Ozzy Osbourne, punctuated by crude jokes.  They then derisively referred to the Pro Bowl as the "dumbest fucking event in sports," suggesting ludicrous alternatives like fan field goal attempts.  A humorous exchange followed concerning a past incident involving one of the hosts and Islanders reporter Jill Nicolini, and the possibility of an apology dinner.  This transitioned into a discussion about a woman damaging a $130 million Picasso painting, debating its value and repairability.  Callers Martin (from California) and Brian (from Philly) offered their opinions on the Nicolini apology and the Picasso's worth, respectively. Another caller prompted a discussion on a TV show about parole hearings and the justice system.  The hosts then reviewed TV shows, harshly criticizing "Avatar" (despite not having seen it), and offering opinions on "30 Rock" and "Two and a Half Men," playing a clip from the latter,  and discussing Tim Sabean's health and the nature of bad comedy, comparing modern sitcoms unfavorably to *MASH*.

The show continued with a deep dive into the formulaic nature of sitcoms, targeting *Two and a Half Men* and *Lucky Louie* for their reliance on tired tropes like "fat guy, hot girl, kid" and unrealistic attractive actors.  They contrasted these with older shows like *Sanford and Son* and *All in the Family*, citing *Arrested Development* as a notable exception.  A substantial portion was devoted to listener calls detailing bizarre experiences with Ambien, ranging from sleepwalking and unusual food cravings to DUI's, sexual encounters, and other memory-loss related incidents.  The Tiger Woods scandal and its possible Ambien connection were also speculated upon, interspersed with a recurring comedic segment featuring a remixed song about the Pope by DJ Damage.  Upcoming guests Jim Florentine and Ozzy Osbourne were mentioned.

A segment focusing on Ambien experiences continued, with more listener calls recounting embarrassing and dangerous behaviors while under the influence.  Doctors John and Steve called in to discuss the drug's effects and risks.  Jim Florentine joined the studio, largely to express his excitement for Ozzy Osbourne’s appearance, sharing anecdotes about past encounters with Ozzy and other rock stars, and his extensive memorabilia collection.  The segment ended with preparations for Ozzy’s arrival.

Ozzy Osbourne’s in-studio interview followed.  It began with Super Bowl predictions and a critique of NFL officiating, specifically the excessive use of pass interference penalties.  Ozzy promoted his new book and upcoming appearances.  Humorous anecdotes were shared, including a bizarre encounter at a former porn theater and a strange man offering a $100 bill in a nearly empty adult film theater.  A significant portion covered Ozzy’s past substance abuse, including candid discussions about cocaine, its effects, and wild anecdotes from his career with Black Sabbath and as a solo artist, including stories of drug use with bandmates, police raids, and his eventual recovery.  He discussed pranks, career highlights (and lowlights) including his relationship with Black Sabbath members, his views on the music industry, Ozzfest, experiences with record companies, a borderline positive HIV test result, defecating in an ice machine, a sleepwalking encounter with a burglar, and his abysmal driving record. The interview concluded with further discussion of his book and public persona.

The final segment revisited the Ozzy Osbourne interview, declaring it their best ever, praising his wit and humor.  Ozzy jokingly told listeners to "fuck you" if they didn't buy his autobiography.  A discussion of a Black Sabbath video from Don Kirshner's Rock Concert highlighted Tony Iommi's prominent stage presence around 1975-76, despite Ozzy being the lead singer, prompting debate on Iommi's ego and the band's drug use.  The hosts recounted humorous encounters with Ozzy, including an awkward restroom meeting; Jim Florentine shared his own interactions and reluctance to approach Ozzy at a urinal.  This led to further discussions about Ozzy's personal life and his autobiography.  The conversation shifted to the Scorpions, playing an obscure song and discussing their early sound, similarities to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, and the controversial "Virgin Killer" album cover.  A caller contributed Scorpions trivia.  Finally, the hosts discussed the upcoming Super Bowl halftime show with The Who, commenting on Pete Townsend's past legal issues.  The show concluded with promotion for Jim Florentine and the Opie and Anthony show itself.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We've got to completely take down regular radio, we've got to fucking just destroy it.  I want it like it was where, you know, language was realistic and raw, sexual content is realistic, and just fucking people reacting with people is realistic. 
[00:00:30]  Sit the fuck back.  I'm being a trumpeter.  I got a catchy name, Shit Radio.  Alright, we hit a low.  We have contact, oh my god, Jimmy's face is all over her pussy.  Look at how small my butt hole is.  That's funny, this is Shit Radio.  And it fucking stinks, it stinks.  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What day is today, Tuesday?  Tuesday.  Oh my god, today is Ozzy day, right?  Is he in there?  Ozzy Osbourne.  Why, little Jimmy was so excited.  I didn't even remember he was coming in.  Oh, I'm sure you didn't like Christmas.  I think that was next week.  It's like Christmas for you.  See, when you were awake all night.  I slept pretty well last night. 
[00:01:30]  But I would nod off and go, Ozzy!  I believe you, I would wake up and go, o'clock, where's the clock?  I'm okay, I didn't ever sleep.  That is the worst feeling ever.  You're so gay for Ozzy.  I'm not gay, I just, a boy likes Ozzy.  No.  I'm homo gay.  It's not homo if it's Ozzy.  We all know that.  That is true.  Not homo, you're just fag for him.  It's not gay if you have respect.  Right.  There's not a man alive that would call you a faggot for sucking Ozzy's cock.  Exactly.  Because it's Ozzy.  As long as you hum Iron Man while you do it. 
[00:02:00]  Oh yeah.  That's the last thing you probably want to see here if you're blowing him, by the way.  Yeah, Ozzy Osbourne doing the other radio show.  And then coming over here.  Yeah, and doing other stuff, so it's Boneyard, that's why I like being here.  No, we're the other radio show.  Oh.  His appearance is being promoted everywhere except for our show, and we'll give the best interview,  and we will have the best time with Ozzy.  But that's just how it works in this world.  Absolutely, we know that.  I think that's a Jets prediction. 
[00:02:30]  Jets had a great year.  Now all the players and the coaches.  We had a fine year.  Fine, fine year.  I told you that would happen.  I heard on the news.  And we talked to some of the Jets the day after the big loss and stuff.  It's like, what, is their opinion going to change?  Yeah, no, I'm glad we lost.  Yeah, I'm pretty glad.  The fact is, yeah, as a Jets fan, we had a great year.  But now we're heading to 42 years without an appearance in the Super Bowl. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to in the end.  You're not going to remember that.  We had a really good year in 2009, 2010.  Yeah.  It's all about winning the big game.  The big game.  The big game.  Come on in.  For the big win.  Yeah.  Come on in for the big win, son.  What's that?  Come on in for the big win.  And the Pro Bowl is this weekend, which is the dumbest.  We were just talking about this stuff, so we might as well throw it on the air.  Yeah.  Pro Bowl is the dumbest fucking event in sports. 
[00:03:30]  The baseball Pro Bowl kind of a thing.  Baseball is kind of cool because they do the home run thing.  Yeah, baseball is good.  That's kind of cool.  I know you're not a basketball fan, but the NBA All-Star Game is pretty strong.  Yeah, it's all right, too.  The whole weekend is pretty strong, and the game itself is a lot of fun.  That's pretty cool.  And hockey, getting there.  Yeah.  They've got some skills competitions. 
[00:04:00]  I'm a big hockey fan, obviously, but I wouldn't say it's the best All-Star Game.  I would have to go baseball, basketball, hockey, football, as far as All-Star Games go.  You know what?  Do they do this during the football one?  Because I could watch this for hours.  What?  Just regular guys trying to kick a field goal for money.  For some reason, that is entertaining as hell for me.  They should do stuff like that.  Because the crowd is just like, oh, yeah, and they laugh at them when it just bounces 
[00:04:30]  down the friggin' sideline.  Regular guys meaning what, fans?  Yeah, fans.  I was thinking the players themselves.  You get those animal linebackers trying to kick field goals, and then you get the punters  to try to throw the ball.  Well, that would be hilarious.  That's happened in games sometimes, and that's pretty tragic.  Oh, yeah.  I like when it's like, and if you're sitting in seat number three, two, five.  And you come out?  Yeah, and then you come out.  Right.  And then you've got to try to put one through the uprights for some cash.  And you realize you break a toe. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Because you don't kick it right.  And you don't know how to kick it.  Because none of us have kicked a football since we were 12, 13 years old.  Yeah.  Oh, I know there's a few of you animals that played high school football.  Relax.  But for the most part, we haven't kicked anything since we were 12, 13, 14 years old.  Before we discovered girls.  Yeah.  And then we stopped kicking shit.  I like hockey when they put that big wooden thing up that's just a little hole the size  of the puck.  Yeah.  And you've got to go like half ice and shoot it in there.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's kind of entertaining.  I like when regular people try to do stuff that real athletes have to do. 
[00:05:30]  You know, I go to a lot of hockey games, and that used to be cool, where you have the  dude trying to put it through that really tiny fucking slot, right?  Yeah.  They don't really do that anymore.  No.  They do Chuck-A-Puck.  What's Chuck-A-Puck?  It's the gayest thing ever.  It is horrendous.  What is it?  Throughout the first two periods, you buy these plastic pucks with numbers on them.  Yeah.  And you can buy a bag for 10.  Hey, you want a bag of pucks? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I'll take a bag of pucks, and you hand over your $10, and they give you like, I forget  how many, because I don't really do it.  I did it once for my nephew.  It already sounds douchey.  I know.  It's like five pucks for $10, something like that.  Yeah.  And then in between the second and third period, they put a bullseye right in the middle of  the ice, and then our ugly bra that does the Islander games, who thinks she's hot,  she comes out in stiletto heels and walks to the center ice with an umbrella, because  she doesn't want to be hit by the pucks.  And then she goes, three, two, one.  And then everyone just chucks. 
[00:06:30]  There you go.  You chuck your puck.  And you chuck your puck.  And the one that lands closest to the center wins.  Problem is, everyone's getting hit in the head, because people are trying to throw them  from the top of the arena.  And what are they?  Obviously, they are not real pucks.  I mean, those would hurt.  They're not a glass.  They're like whiffle pucks.  Yeah, they're really flimsy.  They're pretty hard to throw, actually.  I bet.  Pretty hard to get a little distance on there.  Yeah, because they've got to keep it safe for everybody.  And then she walks out in her stiletto heels and the umbrella, and then she holds up the 
[00:07:00]  number, and that person wins.  Are they the size of real pucks?  Oh, yeah.  So you could take real pucks and throw them across the ice and clock someone in the head  with it, if you wanted to.  Well, this is...  With impunity.  It's just a matter of time.  Some dummy's going to get hit in the head, even though they're very flimsy, and claim  that they're injured, and then this will go away, too.  Very injured by a chuck-a-puck.  Oh, it hurt my neck and my ass back.  Right.  It's called chuck-a-puck. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  That's what's great idea was that.  Yeah.  They used to have...  They used to have asses in seats, huh?  They used to have cool stuff in between periods, but now it's just all horse shit.  Yeah.  It's all just a waste of time until they get the big boys back on.  There used to be some hot chick for the Islanders.  Used to come out.  Yeah, Jill Nicolini.  Was that her name?  Jill Nicolini.  I didn't know.  Man, I told you about her when...  I mean, you went...  I used to go to the games.  But, I mean, obviously, you ended up dating her and stuff.  But the old days, I would be with my ex, right, at the hockey games, and Jill Nicolini 
[00:08:00]  would walk by, and my ex would instantly get pissed off.  I'm like, what the fuck is she doing to you?  Yeah, mine too.  And every woman at the Coliseum would get mad as she walked around.  She smelled great.  She looked great.  She had the big boobies, and she showed off everything.  And my broad is getting mad.  I'm like, you don't even know the broad.  I don't know the broad, so why don't you relax?  Yeah, calm down.  She's a nice piece of ass, yes, but it doesn't mean you have to get pissed off about it. 
[00:08:30]  I wonder if that's still in negotiation.  Oh, is that in...  I don't know.  I haven't heard anything else.  Is there a negotiation going on for the...  Or there might have been some...  For the apology dinner, the official apology dinner?  The apology negotiation.  There was...  It had some legs, and I haven't heard anything since, so it's not off, on...  All right, don't look desperate.  It's in the works.  Let's just sit there for...  That's what I'm doing.  All right, let it sit there. 
[00:09:00]  I'm waiting.  I see what happens.  Don't show desperation.  If something happens where, you know...  Yeah.  Because, obviously, I don't want to go through life thinking I've, you know...  Jimmy chastised me very much when we discussed this about what a creep I was and everything,  and it made me realize, yes, I was pretty creepy in that...  Look, who could blame you, but you might owe her just a slight apology.  Who could blame you?  I mean, we're not going to argue.  The circumstances...  That's what I mean. 
[00:09:30]  Like, we're not going to argue, but you might have hurt her feelings, and now that it's  been a year and a half, you might want to just have an apology dinner.  It's a lot easier after a year and a half.  Yeah, of course.  You know, like, the next week would have been really awkward.  I mean, there's a lot of guys going, wow, that's cool as shit.  I don't want to lie down, but you might owe her a slight apology.  Her ego might be a little bruised.  My only defense I have is that I was on a rebound, you know.  I was on a severe rebound at the time, so you do some fucked up shit.  That's all.  But, you know, we'll see if all I know is that there was some type of intermediary communique 
[00:10:00]  that went down.  And that's all I know about, and we see what happens.  Okay.  That's cool.  Yeah.  See?  I got no qualms with it.  I was, you know, I was kind of a douche and willing to, you know.  A douche?  Yeah.  You were just being a guy.  A guy douche.  You were just being a guy in front of a few million people.  And Jimmy looked at me like, yeah. 
[00:10:30]  I don't, those are the things you say that are kind of not nice and yet we argue about.  But when it's into a microphone, it's...  Ah, that's funny.  Uh, Chuckapock phooey, yeah.  At Berlin Hockey Games they play, no, Steven S., I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.  Spike a, oh, now stop.  We can't say that.  He said it's more of a crowd pleaser.  Yeah.  Crowd pleaser, get it?  So the Pro Bowl is this weekend and pretty much everyone is sitting.  So I don't know who's going to end up playing in this football game. 
[00:11:00]  You got the big stars playing in the big game.  Stupid.  Also known as the Super Bowl.  Can't say it.  We can't say Super Bowl?  No.  Sure we can.  No, they'll arrest us.  We just, I hate that.  We might have to add Super Bowl to the famous George Carlin bit.  It's a big game.  Words you can't say on TV and radio.  You just can't promote something with it, right?  Like you can't say, hey, we're going to have a DJ come by and watch the Super Bowl with you.  Like you can't use it in the way of a promotion, but you can talk about it. 
[00:11:30]  Like if you say who gives a shit about the Super Bowl, are you blown while I watch the Super Bowl?  Right.  You can talk about the Super Bowl, you just can't say something like, yeah.  How weird is it?  Give away TV so you can watch the Super Bowl if you were doing that contest.  If you broadcast, it doesn't matter if it's regular radio, satellite radio, there's two words you basically aren't allowed to say anymore.  The N-word and Super Bowl.  Right.  And look who's playing in the Super Bowl.  The N's.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, so the Pro Bowl is going to have no stars. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, this is weird.  They decided to put it before the Super Bowl.  Now, who the fuck, what stars that are in the Super Bowl, which is who everyone wants to see, wants to risk getting injured, playing a useless nothing game.  Right.  And, you know, get yourself all fucked up.  Ugh.  Ugh, why'd you make me look?  You should have just kept it to yourself.  That story's got no legs, my friend.  Ugh.  What?  The King. 
[00:12:30]  What do you think?  The King.  It's time to talk about the King again.  His contract is up.  Yeah.  Have fun over there.  In regular radio land, if you decide to go, wow.  He ain't going.  Because that's, uh, it's not fun.  Oh, why?  They were terrific to work with.  Ugh.  Anyway.  Don't call it a winky.  Yes.  You can't use the word winky, tweedly-doo.  But I said I ate Chinese food.  Don't say Chinese!  It's Asian cuisine.  Yes, it was non-white food. 
[00:13:00]  It stinks.  No.  Before we move on from the Jill thing, I was thinking something.  Mm-hmm.  So you go out and have your apology dinner?  If that happens.  And you sit there the entire time and tell her that she needs to apologize for burning  the other girl's clothes.  Am I you?  that would be funny  how great would that make  well we're here for the apology  and I'm waiting for the apology  alright that would be great 
[00:13:30]  I'm here for the  apology dinner  we're both seated for the apology dinner  and you just sit there waiting  enough small talk and everything so  where is it  what your apology to me  that would be funny  people are mad I didn't do a quick  me me me me  alright there you go  remember that fucking painting thing yesterday  remember  we got an update on that 
[00:14:00]  that woman that put her ass through the fucking painting  was it her ass  did she fall  I think she fell and her ass hit it  she fell backwards  I thought she fell and then  you know how you take that big step to try to balance yourself  and then right through it  I thought it was her ass  I don't know  funnier if it's her ass  a woman who lost her balance  and tore a hole in the  Pablo Picasso painting  at the Met  likely cut the  130 million  paintings value 
[00:14:30]  holy shit  I didn't  I should have read this  before I went on the air  oh no  the painting was worth  130 million dollars  130 million  this fucking dummy  falls into the painting  they're having some kind of workshop  where they trust these dummies  in front of these valuable paintings  right  she falls  whether it was ass  into the painting  or stepped into it  whatever  caused a six inch tear at the bottom  what did they say  it wasn't near the focal point  of the painting  right  yeah it's a six foot painting  it's giant  okay  well the painting was worth 
[00:15:00]  130 million  it's now worth  65 million  come on  that's a  is that an insurance grab  by the  it's like  eh  fucking  it's only worth  what somebody will pay for it  it's damaged  it's damaged  you can't have a hole  in a painting  and you can't fix it  because it's like  it's  it's something that's been  done already  it's like  right  that's his work  can't they fix it though  in the back  where no one will ever see it  I'm sure they could fix it 
[00:15:30]  but the  thing is  that it's been fixed  if it was fixed by  Pablo Picasso  himself  then it would  maybe not be a problem  there you go  and probably the value  would go up  but the problem is  the dude is dead  yeah  so some schmuck  that went to art school  has to fix it  and who's he  who's he  how bad is the rip  can we see it  a six inch tear  there's no pictures  unfortunately of the rip  and an expert is saying  the painting may never  recover its value  it's a 50% loss  of the value  at least  in a million years  I bet 
[00:16:00]  it'll be worth that much again  yeah  you know what though  it's like  all this really is  it's just a thing  some guy painted  that really is all it is  yeah really  tell the art world  because they take this crap serious  remember the dumb gates  in the central park  that was art to somebody  when an artwork comes up  in auction  that's the first thing  people want to know  were there any  repaints or restorations  yeah  that's the first thing  they ask  even a small hole  and Picasso collectors  like Steven Spielberg  are not going to be interested 
[00:16:30]  that's  alright whatever  okay even a small hole  why did they throw Spielberg  in the middle of this  I guess he's a Picasso collector  oh okay  so there you go  that dummy  wow  reduced the value  of that painting  in half  from 130 to 65  million  I wonder if she offered  to you know  pay for  some duct tape  some paint by numbers  stuff  watercolors  unbelievable  let's say hi 
[00:17:00]  to Martin  in California  Martin  it's kind of early  out there  no  oh yeah  it's way early  how are you guys  doing guys  hi Martin  what's up  I just wanted to  remind Anthony  how we always  bragged about  not going back  to any ex-girlfriend  I'm not talking  about going back  to any ex-girlfriend  what are you  oh  punch it out  it just feels like  he might 
[00:17:30]  might apologize  I don't know  she's a good girl  let's say  I ain't gonna  you know  we kind of miss  having Jill around  maybe she could  stop by every once  in a while  exactly  you could just  look away  I'm just saying  it was a little  harsh  that's all  it was  a little harsh  and perhaps  yeah  right  no you're right  I should  you know  say something  to acknowledge  that  I was kind of  being a douche  a little harsh  yeah  and what  you mean  the girl  after the family  party  with the cutouts  of you  and you were 
[00:18:00]  fucking somebody  in the closet  and she actually  got mad  and then you  humiliated her  on the radio  that was a little  that one  that situation  okay Mr. Pushups  I'm gonna keep  on you  I do love Anthony  and it is fun  to watch  your friend  going through  this battle  of conscience  because you know  Anthony is  people who don't  know him  he is a really  nice guy  I try to be  you're not a guy  who just is  mean to people  but you know  I sometimes 
[00:18:30]  want the old cake  and eat it too  as they say  and coming off  a rebound  I may have been  a little overzealous  in my overlapping  of certain  personal relationships  per second  per second  I love the little  son of a bitch  basically you wanted  a lot of pussy  what  no I wasn't  saying that  you know 
[00:19:00]  more to  hanging out  with a female  than just pussy  Opie  I'll say  out of Brian  in Philly  Brian  Hey good morning  Opie  Anthony  Jimmy  I'm kind of  amazed  that the value  of that painting  would be cut in  half  it's still  a one of a  kind item  there's nothing  else like it  in the world  so if it's  repaired to the  point where  it can't be  noticed  and someone  wants to buy  it what are 
[00:19:30]  they going to  say  like  it's damaged  I'm going to  buy something  else  well  these people  buy this stuff  as investments  they don't buy it  because it looks  good in their  apartment  because if that  was the case  then you're  getting a great  bargain  like fuck  I could get  a Picasso  for 65 million  if you live  in that type  of world  with those  type of numbers  you got Ferrari  that's brand  new out of  the showroom  and then you  get another one  that's been  wrecked and  then fixed  which one  are you going  to pay more  for  but Ferrari 
[00:20:00]  they make  several  Ferraris  it's not  a unique  one of a  kind  item  this  painting  is  the only  one of  its kind  it can  never be  made  again  you know  what I  would do  I would  try to  collect  65 million  dollars  I would  buy the  Picasso  painting  I would  and then  I would  exhume  the body  of Pablo  Picasso  and then  I would  get a  young art  student  to just  kind of  hold  his hand  hold the  brush  in his  rotting  hand  and have  Picasso  himself  technically  fix the  painting  he's  actually  touching up 
[00:20:30]  the  painting  that would  be a  good  one  imagine  wow  then you  advertise it  to the  world  that Pablo  Picasso  himself  fixed this  painting  from beyond  the grave  I think  you got  something  there  but what  you gotta  do is  exhume  the body  exhume  a word  we don't  like around  here  exhume  they  exhumed  the body  and did  toxicology  tests  oh we see  that on  forensic  files  nothing  creepier  when you  see like  a graveyard  it's  raining  and here 
[00:21:00]  comes  the tractor  and the  back  hole  to exhume  the body  yeah  that is  creepy  anyway  I was  watching some  great shows  on  forensic  files  and that  stuff  and then  I came  across a  new show  it's  called  I don't know  like  parole  or something  parole  that sounds  cool  and it's  these people  that are  obviously  in prison  and they  go through  their crimes  yeah  parole board  it's called 
[00:21:30]  they go through  their crimes  and tell  them what  they did  and then  they show  them  sitting  before  the parole  board  and giving  their spiel  and then  the parole  board  going  fuck you  so we're  going to  have to  deny  your parole  this time  and other  people  they let  out  I'm sitting  there going  why are  they letting  this motherfucker  out  and then  they give  you a little  update  oh he's  arrested  like  the next  year  it's  a tough  spot  because no  one wants  to hire  anyone that  has a  record  if you have  a little  record  an employer  looks the  other way  right  I mean  it doesn't  look the  other way 
[00:22:00]  it doesn't  hire you  they have  one guy  that was  up for  parole  so what  do you  expect  from these  guys  if they  really  mean  to  have  a  life  parole  hearing  I was going  to just say  a good  life  where they  don't go  back into  crime  and then  these people  are fucking  forced back  into crime  because what  else are they  going to do  well that's  just it  see I didn't  know this  as I'm  watching it  the parole  board  kind of  bases it  on  they don't  just sit 
[00:22:30]  you down  look at  your records  talk to  you and  then say  you're in  or out  they ask  you like  there's  certain  I know  nothing  and don't  want to  know  anything  about  prison  but  apparently  there's  these  little  programs  you go  to  and  classes  and  things  and  they  recommend  them  to  you  if  you're  a drug  addict  or a  drunk  they  recommend  certain  programs  for  you  sexual  deviant  programs  there's  jobs  education  programs  things like  that  and  if  you're  denied 
[00:23:00]  parole  they tell  you  look  here's  what you  need to  do  before  your  next  parole  hearing  and  then  we'll  consider  it  again  and  if  they  come  back  and  they go  well  we  recommended  you do  this  program  did you  complete  it  no  no  it  shows  that  you're  really  not  fucking  gung  ho  about  it  why  wouldn't  you  complete  a  well  that's  just  it  there's  a lot  of  lazy  bums  in there  and  thugs  that  aren't  willing  to do  anything  but  sit  and  rot  in  prison  and  then  there's  some  people  that  go  above  and  beyond  the  programs  that  they  give  them  and  have  been  locked  up  for 
[00:23:30]  a  lot  of  years  for  not  maybe  some  of  them  work  out  but  a  large  percentage  of  the  ones  I  watched  got  locked  back  up  again  oh  really  yeah  and  it  was  cool  because  they  went  to  different  places  and  they  showed  how  different  it  is  in  like  one  was  Nevada  one  was  New  Jersey  the other  one  was  Hawaii  one  is  West  Virginia  and  Hawaii  what  pricks  like 
[00:24:00]  you gotta  have  like  a lawyer  there  and  they're  yelling  at  the  convicts  and  shit  and  then  like  West  Virginia  they're  just  like  hello  sir  sit  down  and  whatever  you gotta  do  but  that  makes  sense  that's  why  everyone  wants  to  go  to  Hawaii  yeah  cause  I'm  watching  them  walk  around  the yard  in  Hawaii  and  like  it's  a  giant  open  kind  of  atrium  and  it's  like  the  guy's  in  Hawaii  it's  not  a  bad  place  to  do  your  time  I  mean  he's  walking  around  in  Hawaii  when  you  get  your  sky  over  his  head  when  you  get  your  hour 
[00:24:30]  outside  it's  under  palm  trees  it's  nice  you know  people pay  a lot  of money  for that  but that  one sex  offender  guy  that was  just  a  real  fucking  deviant  and  he was  only in  there  for like  a  year  and  he was  trying  to  get  out  he's  before  the  parole  board  how  he  got  the  ability  to  even  get  before  the  board  after  a  year  is  amazing  it's  a  16  year  old  girl  he  didn't  even  know  her  just  runs  up  to  her  starts  choking  her  puts  her  face  in  a  gravel  in  a  driveway  drags  her  down  an  alley 
[00:25:00]  he's  fucking  diddling  her  and  molesting  her  and  because  she  didn't  want  to  testify  because  she  was  so  fucked  up  they  gave  him  a  plea  deal  for  attempted  assault  and  stuff  so  it  was  like  they  didn't  let  him  out  but  he's  not  going  to  serve  that  much  time  is  it  because  without  her  they  might  not  have  had  the  physical  evidence  maybe  they  didn't  go  that  deep  into  the  case  but  it's  like  she  doesn't  want  to  testify  she's  traumatized  but  this 
[00:25:30]  guy  admittedly  did  it  he  had  priors  he  had  prior  sexual  convictions  and  they  let  him  out  on  that  why  how  is  this  guy  before  the  parole  boy  it's  amazing  how  many  people  do  not  do  their  entire  stint  in  prison  that's  what  amazes  just  about  every  single  person  I would  love to  know  what  percentage  it's  got to  be  ridiculously  high  of course  it is  cool  show  though  another  one  of  those  good  you  know  is  that  on 
[00:26:00]  true  tv  I  don't  even  know  what  the  fuck  channel  it  was  on  what  was  bio  channel  and  smithsonian  channel  how  do  you  find  all  these  great  channels  because  I've  given  up  there's  so  many  channels  you  go to  the  educational  section  that's  what  I'm  saying  there's  so  many  freaking  channels  if you  ever  start  from  like  two  and  just  keep  going  I  know  where  to  start  see  you're  good  like  I  sit  there  I  start  two  and  then I  stop  when I  finally  find  something  good  but  then  I  never  go  any  further  and 
[00:26:30]  that's  probably  where  all  the  really  good  stuff  is  my  cable  system  here's  where  I  start  45  damn  I  don't  even  deal  with  anything  below  45  and  then  I  go  what  is  45  though  45  is  something  like  45  we're  talking  to  the  whole  country  could  be  the  CBS  affiliate  it's  around  the  like  where  45  Comedy  Central  yeah  Comedy  Central  and then  like  Mythbusters  is after  they hate  CNN  they 
[00:27:00]  buried  CNN  they  readjusted  all their  channels  recently  CNN  used to  be  channel  8  or  10  now  it's  like  72  it  is  buried  I wonder  what  that's  about  oh no  they  fucked  that  up  too  and  there's  a  thing  you  can  go  to  on  my  cable  network  now  where  you  hit  a button  and you  get  like  8  screens  of  the  news  and you  can  just  click  on  anyone  and it's  all  like  the  when I 
[00:27:30]  was on  vacation  on the  west coast  they had  that  and I  was  just  laying  in bed  just watching  8 news  channels  at once  and if  one has  a really  good  fucking  story  you just  click  and it  goes  full screen  it is  the best  feature  ever  what  channel  38  37  26  cable  vision  although  I hate  cable  vision  because  for some  reason  their  signal  every  so  often  more  often  than  I  like  you're  watching  a movie  or the  news  and they're  like  today  is  happening 
[00:28:00]  in  8  that  digital  skip  or whatever  it's  called  and it's  all pixelated  for a second  Time Warner  does it  too a lot  same thing  same thing  they're  overusing  they don't  have enough  room for  the bandwidth  they're using  and they're  trying to  squeeze it  you know  what  cut out  all the  Spanish  channels  I don't  use them  a lot of  fucking  Spanish people  out there  they're  taking  over  from  200  to  300 
[00:28:30]  they're  taking  over  on my  system  it's  all  Spanish  from  200  to  300  can't you  not have  those channels  and use  more bandwidth  or doesn't  work that  well  why should  I have  to do  that  they should  know  not to  broadcast  that  in my  neighborhood  I could  probably  get it  taken  so it  skips  right  from  200  to  300  while I'm  flipping  through  the  channel  would  that  make  your  bandwidth  any  better  or no  not  probably  my  cable  box  it's  got to 
[00:29:00]  start  at  the  headquarters  yes  all  right  I got  fiber optic  motherfucker  well that  fucking show  sounds really  cool  yeah that's  a good  one  forensic  files  the  investigators  I was  watching  that  the  fucking  vampire  killing  guy  what was  his name  fuck  I was  looking  it up  before  this  guy's  sick  Rod  Farrell  he  was  like  1996  and  he  went  into  this  friend's  house  and  murdered  her  parents 
[00:29:30]  wow  she  was  like  16  years  old  or  something  and  took  their  vehicle  and  runs  off  with  her  and  she  gets  off  scot-free  because  she's  like  I  didn't  know  what  was  going  on  but  he  was  like  an  evil  vampire  motherfucker  thought  he  was  a  vampire  you  know  and  just  the  way  his  confession  was  was  just  brutal  talking  about  how  he  bashed  their  fucking  heads  in  left  a  three  inch  hole  in  the  mother's  head  because  she  threw  coffee  on  me  and  that's  why  I  had  to  bash  her  fucking  brains  in  oh  good  it's  like  wow  this  guy's  fucking  hardcore  and  they 
[00:30:00]  gave him  the  death  penalty  and  that's  how  they  left  it  on  the  show  and  then  I  looked  today  and  of  course  they  put  life  without  parole  for  you  know  they  did  because  he  was  16  at  the  time  I  guess  but  he  was  all  fucked  up  he's  not  going  to be  a  productive  member  of  anything  so  get  rid  of  him  the  jets  are  still  playing  awesome  what  happened  what  happened  did  you  see  a 
[00:30:30]  replay  oh  it's  a  replay  opening  see  no  they  they  brought  everyone  back  a  mistake  had  been  made  they  have  to  replay  I  thought  a  mistake  was  made  and  they  let  me  tell  you  something  about  this  radio  show  you  listen  to  we  are  really  good  we  are  actually  close  to  great  when  the  Tiger  Wood  story  broke  we  told  everyone 
[00:31:00]  exactly  what  happened  and  now  a mere  three  four  months  later  they're  telling  the  same  story  we  said  we  know  what  happened  just  google  it  google  it  we  were  the  ones  that  said  it  first  we  had  news  calling  us  thousand  million  news  day  fucking  one  we  had  the  story  yeah  and  it's  pretty  similar  to  what  we  told  or  what  we  said  we  had  a  big  red  flag  and  an  uh  oh  there 
[00:31:30]  was  an  accident  and  he  backed  into  this  and  pulled  we  all  just  went  uh  oh  not  like  oh  what  happened  maybe  the  accelerator  stuck  I  guess  wrong  what  did  you  say  I  said  I  think  that  they  they  had  a  craving  for  kit  kats  and  he  had  rushed  out  gallantly  to  get  them  gallantly  they're  delusious  but that  was just a  miscalculation  and his wife  was just not a good  golfer and was trying to  hit the ball before he got home  and she hit his truck  remember  that could have happened  but it didn't 
[00:32:00]  he liked to fuck a lot of  whores  what a dope he is  Jesus  what a rookie  so well  wait till you hear what he did  right after the break  we'll get right into it  and the Nancy  Kerrigan story  is another story  we bring up on the  show a lot  where a lot of people  out there  your parents  and you're raising  your own fucking murderer  yeah  and that's exactly  what happened  with this whole  Nancy Kerrigan situation  allegedly  of course  and we'll explain  after the break  although I'm sure  you know the details  by now  because we're not  going to be like  the local news  me and Ann  are sitting there  and they're like 
[00:32:30]  Nancy Kerrigan's  father is dead  and you're not  going to believe  who's involved  and that's the tease  this morning  like really  you do realize  that everyone  is on the internet  pretty much  all day long  who doesn't know  the details  of this story  but they are using  the tease  of who murdered  the father  to get you  through the commercials  which is better  for the station's  revenue  because more people  see the commercials  they're actually  using a death  to tease their  fucking advertising  and no one  complains about it  but the tease  on TV news 
[00:33:00]  is just an archaic  way of getting  people to stick  around  because in this  day and age  there's not one  story that they  tease on the news  that I don't  already know  what happened  through the internet  it's just  or Twitter  or whatever  there's no one  that has to look  at the news  and have a tease  and go  what happened  I better stick  around for that  of course  you know  everything they're  going to be talking  about that  an extreme small  percent of the  viewers are sticking 
[00:33:30]  around because  they don't know  fucking fossilized  people that have  no clue what  the internet is  I'm sure there's  a few but not  worth like teasing  it to the masses  they really have  to come up with  a new strategy  yeah they've got  to figure it out  because at this  point everyone  knows the stories  before you tell  them on the news  3D news  3D news  how about 3D news  with big boobie  boobie  so it's an avatar  boobie  here goes Anne again  but he hasn't  seen the movie  by the way  it beat Titanic  so it's now  the number one  grossing movie 
[00:34:00]  ever ever  it's my new  favorite bit  that you're so  mad at avatar  and you haven't  even fucking  seen it  I don't need  to see it  you have a lot  to say about  a movie  you haven't  seen  3D  if it wasn't  3D  it wouldn't  have fucking  grossed as much  that is a  gimmick movie  that is true  gimmick  well  that's like  saying okay  I am going  to play  I am going  to write a  shitty ass  fucking movie  okay  shitty ass  movie  put it in  the theaters  and everyone  that comes in  gets a blowjob 
[00:34:30]  from a prostitute  or something  you just line up  the chicks in front  of the seats  and you get  blowjob  number one  grossing film  in the country  in days  you're not thinking  why  you still got to  get the female  audience to get  those number one  numbers  the guys will  come back  more times  I'm going to  get repeat  viewings of a  shitty ass movie  I can play  that stupid  polo movie  that shit  hey after avatar  anything is possible  anything is possible 
[00:35:00]  3D  3D  it's going to be  great  but you have to  have an imaginary  planet that sounds  cool  like Pandora  Pandora  Pandora  Pandora  we must save  the trees  please  please see avatar  so we can  really  I will  because I  I like the movie  but now I'm ready  to completely bash it  because that's what  I need to do  in my world  even stuff I really  like I got to  completely just  destroy and bash  I'm ready for that  yes  so you got to  see avatar  so we can have  a field day 
[00:35:30]  wait till you see  them docking  I'm probably  going to come  there's a lot  of docking  in avatar  I'll probably  come in and be  like  it was the  most amazing  movie I've  ever seen  oh my god  I was crying  painted blue  little avatar  creature  yes  I want to  be one  well this guy  wants to agree  with Anthony  on his avatar  review even though  Anthony hasn't  seen avatar  of course  Cal in New  Jersey  and you're  so right on  this avatar 
[00:36:00]  is just a  piece of shit  the visuals are  amazing but the  story is just  absolute shit  so it's gimmick  moving  the 3D  gimmick  got the  movie  the press  it got  and the  reason that  it's now  number one  over Titanic  is because of  the gimmicky  3D  why do you  think the  story was  shit  because everything  in the story  was done in  James Cameron's  other movies  I mean like  and plus I mean  the main plot  is just dances  with wolves  well you got a  little dances 
[00:36:30]  with wolves  Pocahontas  type thing  happening but  the storyline  isn't shit  it's not  the greatest  story you're  going to see  on film  but  sir was  Titanic  a great  story  basically the  story was  the ship  goes under  the water  how do they  fall in love  so quickly  they're only  on a ship  for a couple  days  people are  and have  been for a  while  obsessed with  the Titanic  and the whole  thing it's just  gotten this  like almost  glamorous thing  to it  they romanticized  it  exactly  and it's  it's like  and then you 
[00:37:00]  throw in that  fucking love  story to get  the broads in  there and  then you throw  in the amazing  at the time  CGI of the  ship actually  sinking  you watch a  movie like  a night to  remember which  was Titanic  movie that  was made  years ago  black and  white  you watch  something like  that and then  you watch  Titanic and  you're like  holy fuck  that's what  that ship  looked like  sinking  that's exactly  what that  looked like  sinking from  a life  boat  I didn't  give a shit  but the broads  are all in  for that  that's why  that movie 
[00:37:30]  won  got number  one  they got  everybody  but you  make a great  point  now we know  how the  Titanic  truly sank  yeah  that was so  fucking  that was like  watching that  was like  holy fuck  that's how  that went  down  imagine that  in 3D  3D  3D  why doesn't  he do  with George  Lucas  and start  redoing his  fucking movies  in 3D  yes  George Lucas  wants to do  that with the  Star Wars  how's he  gonna redo  I mean  just take  the film  he'll probably  take the film  3D it somehow  and then put  some scenes in  that are conducive  to 3D  like they'll be 
[00:38:00]  all fucking  at-at  looking at you  what are you  talking about  no Star Wars  in general  you don't have to  you don't have to  jazz it up  if it was just  in 3D  it'd be cool  as shit  yeah  how much mileage  is he gonna get  out of those movies  how much  has he already  it's enough  already with Star Wars  because Avatar  didn't just throw  3D shit at you  just cause they can  that's why  I think this was  a really good  3D movie  yeah  yeah  they didn't like  well that's just  all of a sudden  have stuff floating  in front of your  face so you  look like a dummy  reaching out  thinking you  could touch it  I get it 
[00:38:30]  so it's not  that type  but it's still  a gimmicky thing  it is  it is  gimmicky  no  hey can  I gotta ask you  a question  George Lucas  did he ever do  anything else  besides Star Wars  movies  Indiana Jones  American Graffiti  oh  oh okay  duh  okay  but Indiana Jones  is kind of done  with Spielberg  right  yeah  I don't think  of that as  a Lucas movie  I forgot about  American Graffiti  though  I forgot about  good movie  overrated  good  forgot about  just big names  in it  alright  yeah  I'm not sure 
[00:39:00]  I haven't seen  that in years  and it was  kind of  if you look  at it now  it doesn't  date well  not the fact  that it's a  fucking period  piece  but like  they kind of  do that  split screen  Woodstock-y  thing  and that  makes it  look old  but was it  directed well  like were the  scenes shot  because I  remember it  kind of  looking very  cool and  late 50s-ish  with the lights  and everything  I think he  might have done  a good job  on that  maybe  I remember  I was watching  it recently  in a diner  in LA  Mel's Diner  actually  is where  it was shot  and they have 
[00:39:30]  it running  there constantly  oh they do  yeah  it's like  when you're  eating  it's like  on a couple  of screens  and you know  Dreyfuss  and Ron Howard  and Cindy Williams  you know  it was a big  cast but  yeah  and one of  the Phillips  broads  was Mackenzie  Phillips  in there  yeah  but she was  a big girl  already  oh yeah  the duckies  let's say  hi to Kent  the movie guy  Kent  oh boy  I just want to  say I think 
[00:40:00]  there's a great  reason why  Avatar has a  really simple  storyline  and it's  easy to take  in for mass  audiences  you know  a lot of  people don't  necessarily like  science fiction  but you put  a simple  storyline out  there  and then you  just wow  them with  great visuals  and when you  go back  and do a  second film  you can  you know  really go  deeper with  the story  you know  kind of like  how Star Wars  is a pretty  simple movie  and then Empire  Strikes Back  they take  everything up  to another  level  is that true  it  you're a Star Wars 
[00:40:30]  fan  I could see  that  sure  I mean  Kent's  making a pretty  good point  the storyline  is very  basic  so you don't  really have to  sit there  and figure  shit out  yeah  I mean  you don't want  to be thinking  the whole time  while you're  also going  oh my god  this scene's  more gorgeous  than the last  scene and this  scene looks  better than that  well so you  can't have  something that  looks spectacular  and has a good  story because  the human mind  can't handle it  yeah  well no  I just think  the general  public  aren't looking  he's right  though  the masses  really  yeah unfortunately  that is the truth  the best  science fiction  film of the 
[00:41:00]  past year  was Moon  and it  didn't really  do well  because people  are like  well what's  it about  dude I  didn't  I thought  they fucking  petered out  on that  it looked  like it was  going to be  really good  Moon  yeah  I want to  see Moon  Moon was  like I liked  it but  if I really  liked it I  would have  gone online  and like  looked at  what other  people were  saying about  it and shit  it just  didn't really  grab me  and believe me  I was looking  for that  motherfucking  movie for  a long time  and I finally  you know  found it  playing in a 
[00:41:30]  theater  mind you  but it was  okay but  not like  great I  wouldn't  consider that  a great movie  I was thinking  like thinking  man's type of  science fiction  you have that  yeah  and then you  have Avatar  which is  completely on  the other end  of science fiction  now what about  Aliens  what about  Aliens  James Cameron  did that  yeah  he's done  a ton of  great movies  now that was  a great movie  a lot of  action  yeah  any of that  in Avatar  can you see  any old  he dragged  out of 
[00:42:00]  Aliens  that's a good  question  I don't know  there's a lot  of influence  from Aliens  in Avatar  a ton of  influence  yeah  in general  everything from  the big robots  like the loader  right right  right  you know  just the marine  mentality  remember the  pilot at the  beginning of  Aliens  what the chick  the female  yeah the female  we're in the  pipe  five by five  yeah  love that chick  she's basically  Michelle Rodriguez  is a more  blown out  version of  her character  oh really  you know  including the 
[00:42:30]  glasses and  everything  she's just  there's a lot  of characters  who could be  pulled right  out of  Aliens  Rodriguez  in Avatar  fucking one  sexy  brod  but more  importantly  is Bill  Paxton  in Avatar  no  is this the  first movie  that James  Cameron made  without Bill  Paxton in it  poor Bill  Paxton  how did he  get left out  there's a ton of  he might end  up in it  I bet he is  some pretty  shit now  alright Kent  thank you sir  Star Wars wasn't 
[00:43:00]  a great story  it was a fun movie  but you know  there's a hairy  thing flying a  spaceship  it's kind of  silly  but for the  time  for the time  it was  pretty amazing  yeah  you know what  he does make  a good point  with you have  to like  put this stuff  out for the  masses  yeah  like TV  I was watching  30 Rock  last night  I DVR'd it  right  I love that  fucking show  critics love  that fucking  show  it doesn't  really  do well  it's never  done above  a three  it does  okay  but I love  that fucking  show 
[00:43:30]  I love the  writing  Alec Baldwin  is amazing  Tracy Morgan  is amazing  this damn  thing  no one's  watching it  as far as  network TV  numbers go  stays on  though  they stay  on  but it's  like  it's always  on the cusp  of being  cancelled  because they  need just  a little  more viewership  to keep  this thing  going  we'll end  up losing  30 Rock  eventually  it'll just  you know  but other  shows that  are dumbed  down  they just  do way  better than  30 Rock  that's just  how it  is  unfortunately  oh yeah  isn't that  fucking  two and a 
[00:44:00]  half men  still on  two and a  half  how is  that  still  the fuck  on  it's the  most popular  comedy  I don't  get it  I don't  get it  either  the second  I saw  that I'm  like  this has  to be  cancelled  and unlike  you Anthony  I actually  watched it  so I could  talk about  it  I don't  need to  watch it  I have  seen it  before  it really  is my  new  favorite  bit  I haven't  seen it  I have  watched  two and a  half men  and it's  like every  other sitcom  that came  before it  it's  you know  the set 
[00:44:30]  up  punchline  set up  punchline  sitcom  no one  really talks  that way  bullshit  I hate  fucking  shows like  that  it's the  exact same  sitcom  the set  the fucking  characters  yeah  do we have  any that  on YouTube  no surprises  is what it is  trust me  I don't get  it  I don't  get it  Jimmy  just like  one scene  from there  I've never  seen it  I've seen  the coming  attractions  I love  Charlie Sheen  but  this doesn't  seem like  my kind  of show  you know what  I realized 
[00:45:00]  I love  Charlie Sheen  in Platoon  Wall Street  is pretty good  was that pre  or post  Platoon  that was  87  alright  well that  Platoon  era  Sheen  that I like  anything after  that it just  got stupid  you basically  liked him when  he was like  banging hookers  yeah perhaps  he was better  better than  so you like  Danny likes him  in the wife  hitting phase  you like him  in the hooker  phase  I like Picasso  right  the bludgeoning  phase 
[00:45:30]  hey we got a  scene from  two and a half  men  alright  let's see  maybe we're  missing the boat  on this  open minds  people  Danny just found  one random  fucking scene  on YouTube  it's called  two and a half  men  two and a half  man  eaters  little set up  Charlie Sheen  is in a  classroom  I believe  it looks like  some type  of classroom  it must be  a good clip  because there's  over 7 million  views  are you  fucking  so this is  really something  we should be  getting  if we're part  of humanity  there's a girl  in the classroom  who appears to be  maybe a teacher  I don't know how 
[00:46:00]  the story works  but now they're  going to exchange  humorous  banter  she's in a wedding  dress and he's  shitting on her  off the desk  oh that's on your  monitor  what are you  watching  does Tim Sabian  have AIDS  oh my god  why  I just saw him  walking down the  hall  he's unrecognizable  what happened  to him  he can't eat  on what they  probably pay him  around here  I mean we love  the guy but he's  melting away  is that him I  just saw walking  to a room down  the hall  I chatted with  him he's actually  in all kind of 
[00:46:30]  good shape  he's on this  workout regimen  honestly  he inspired me  to want to do it  but I didn't  obviously  can we play a bit  after the break  called  where the fuck  is the first one  god damn  now it's coming  in  it's a long  name  if your comedy  has a blank  it sucks  because Blue Heeler  started with  if your comedy  has a laugh track  it sucks  maybe we can come  up with a few more  after the break  MASH did have a  laugh track 
[00:47:00]  and it was good  at the time  hold on  can I tell you  something about  MASH though  the laugh track  was subtle  all the comedies  had it when we  were growing up  it was a subtle  laugh track  it pumped up  the joke  slightly  now it's like  they're just  pumping up  laughs  where nothing  funny is being  said  that was indicative  of the time  with MASH  I think on the DVDs  you can shut  the laugh track  off  I'm almost  positive you can  somebody can  maybe correct me  on that  didn't they do  an episode  without a laugh track 
[00:47:30]  I think at the end  they didn't have them  really  they didn't have it  in the last couple  years  they started realizing  that it didn't  make sense anymore  I remember being  big news once  that they like  we're going to do  this episode  of MASH  without the laugh  track  MASH used to  get a lot of  press by doing  new things  they would do  an episode  in real time  once  where some  soldier was  wounded  and they had  a clock  in the bottom  right hand corner  and they had  to save him  by a certain  time  they were always  trying some  weird  friggin different 
[00:48:00]  things  the black and  white episodes  they would do  the interview  episodes  where they were  doing an interview  and it was black  and white  the cursing  you'd occasionally  hear  like when Hawkeye  called Mako  a son of a bitch  you had never  heard that on  television  don't let the  bastards win  couldn't believe  you just heard  that on CBS  oh wow  and you couldn't  even rewind it  to watch it again  I know  Kevin from  Connecticut  if your comedy  has a gay guy  it sucks  not true  psychotic  if your comedy  has a fat man  married to a hot 
[00:48:30]  woman  it sucks  I agree with that  you know what  Audrey Meadows  wasn't hot  but she was  the honeymooners  for the time  I think Audrey  Meadows  was pretty hot  like you see  when she comes  out of the room  in one episode  she comes out  and she's in  her robe  going  what are you  doing around  and she's like  in her robe  and you don't  see tit  by any stretch  of the imagination  what about  nip  but you see  you see  like where  the robe  is opened  a little  and you can  you know  there's tit  in there  and it's like 
[00:49:00]  that's kind  of sexy  she wasn't  bad  no exactly  at the time  I mean  she was wearing  that big  fucking  red lipstick  and shit  but I mean  the reason  she didn't  get the job  when she first  did the audition  was she was  too pretty  Gleason wanted  to fuck her  she was too  pretty  and then she  came in  with her  all messed up  and Gleason  didn't even  recognize her  and he said  wow she's  perfect for the  role  and he goes  you saw her  and sent her  away saying  she's not  she's too  pretty for the  role  and he goes 
[00:49:30]  that's the  same girl  he goes  yeah  hire her  right there  well every  sitcom  steals from  the Honeymooners  yeah that's  the basic  formula  when you say  fat guy  married to  hot chick  the Honeymooners  kind of had  that  so they  stole that  as well  if your comedy  has a kid  in most cases  it stinks  not all cases  but in most cases  it's bad  fat girl  I mean fat girl  fat guy  hot girl  and a kid  lucky Louie 
[00:50:00]  fat guy  yeah  but at least  one thing about  Lucky Louie  that was funny  was Pam  Pam Adlon  had an incident  with her kids  where she said  she wanted to  murder them  and the episode  where Lucy is bad  and fucking Louie's  cursing at her  and she's like  our kid's an asshole  that's the way  parents will think  about their kids  it was mean  it's the only reason  I brought it up  it's so  on  fat guy  hot girl  kid  the way it was  presented on that show  Jesus Christ  but Louie stripped it down  he at least made it 
[00:50:30]  different  that's the key  I guess the point  we're trying to make  is that these sitcoms  are the exact same  fucking show  just different people  in the roles  or whatever  his ugly dick  he showed  Louie showed  his horrible dick  yeah  Seinfeld didn't show  his dick  right  it couldn't have been  as bad as Louie's  hey look  even in the 60's  Hogan's heroes  even Nazis  were funny  Jesus  so let's see the clip  and really fast  I don't want to forget 
[00:51:00]  this  someone writes  don't forget  Arrested Development  best comedy show  Arrested Development  was an amazing show  no one got it  and it had to go away  the fucking show  just  it got cancelled  and it was amazing  the writing  the characters  it was  it was a great show  it really was  alright finally  this clip  I'm sorry  so it's  two and a half men  this clip has gotten  seven and a half million views  it's gotta be funny  it's gotta be  here we go  she's running up  hugging him  what is this 
[00:51:30]  a montage  it's a montage  how the fuck is this  of just  uh oh  started as a montage  now it says  with man eaters  wasn't that amazing  I hate myself  try she  are you ready for me  alright we gotta stop this  let's get our losses  we can find another clip  it's more of a montage  there isn't just a  dialogue 
[00:52:00]  we need a dialogue  just dialogue  a quick scene  from two and a half men  but by the way  that sucked  even what I saw  well why don't we find  that clip  we'll take a break  and we'll regroup  we'll do a little more of  if your comedy has  a blank  it sucks  and then we can make love  oh  if a comedy has  a very special episode  it sucks  that's so true  if your comedy has  Mr. Carlson and Dudley  and no one gets raped  it sucks  Stephen S. from Bayshore  if your show has  a well balanced 
[00:52:30]  racial mix  it sucks  if they show  the characters  during the beginning credits  laughing or smiling  and looking into the camera  it sucks  yeah  alright  quick break  we'll continue  Opie and Anthony  let's not forget  Ozzy Osbourne  in about  hour and a half  let's call it  an hour and a half  from right now  and Jim Florentine  stop  Florentine's coming  in a little while  cool  alright  Van Halen right 
[00:53:00]  which song though  which one  which one  it's the one  where David Leroy  goes  Mean Streets  Mean Streets  I should have  Eddie Van Halen  55 years old  today  me and Travis  work together  and we're not  even talking  between the breaks  we knew  to play a little  Van Halen  and then I go  oh  Eddie Van Halen's  birthday  55  you think I'll blow  out his candles  and his tongue  will fly out  take that stupid 
[00:53:30]  and here's one  for the people  remember when  Billy Joel  crashed into that  tree  the house  or the tree  the house  or the tree  the tree  maybe it was  a house tree  combo  how many  accidents  has he had  quite a few  it was the  famous one  where he  crashed into a  tree  which I believe  was right in  front of the  house  guess how many  years ago  that was  this is depressing  how many  ten  seven 
[00:54:00]  that's seven  years ago  already  seven  and then another  quick little  little  little  little  little  thing  which game  had more  people watching  the Jets  and Colts  or the  Viking Saints  oh  wow  good one  for real  or Jets  Colts  had to be  right  I know  this is  useless  shit  but it  gets people  thinking  I'm just  thinking  they're having  their first  cup of coffee  Viking Saints  because of  Favre  nope  which game 
[00:54:30]  had more  people watching  you say  Jimmy  Viking Saints  because of  Favre  just because  of Favre  here's my  my logic  Anthony says  Jets Colts  had more  people  New York's  always going  to draw a  fuckload of  people  it was the  first  game that  was on  it was  Sunday  afternoon  come on  bring it  home  Anthony  bring it  home  show your  knowledge  and you're  looking at  one of the  best quarterbacks  in the history  of quarterbacking  Peyton Manning  yeah  very good 
[00:55:00]  but you're  wrong  Jimmy's  right  which I  would have  went with  the Jets  Colts  myself  because the  big New  York market  because the  last the  first playoff  game against  the Bengals  I forgot  what the  number was  but it  was a  ridiculous  number of  people watching  the game  the percentage  of TVs  watching the  Jets  it was  insane  it was  insane  yeah  47 million  people watched  the Jets  Colts on  Sunday  you think  that's  wow  Viking 
[00:55:30]  Saints  had 58  million  they had  another  11 million  fucking  people watching  and that  makes it  the most  watched  non-Super  Bowl  telecast  since  Seinfeld's  finale  which did  76 million  that was a  football game  what  what happened  I thought  you were  talking about  football games  wow  yeah  now  okay  I'm  thinking  so fucking  two dimensionally  the time  thing  I think  West Coast  no  West Coast  how  why 
[00:56:00]  why was  it  what's  their  explanation  Brett  forever  I guess  I guess  that was  a better  game  see that's  what happens  when you're  a Jets  fan  you live  in New  York  you think  well the  Jets  game  has to  be the  better  game  well they  split the  market  with the  Giants  too  a lot  of people  hate  the Jets  and didn't  want to  see it  right  a lot  of people  like ah  fuck  the Jets  you know  but  in that  voice  Minnesota  New Orleans  that's  like two  relatively  small markets  far  and the  fact the  Saints  have never  gone  and people  have more  of an  interest in  New Orleans  since Katrina  people kind 
[00:56:30]  of rooting  for New  Orleans to  do well  like yeah  you know  people still  looking at  it like  the city's  in trouble  so  who dat  what does  that mean  I don't know  could one  fucking Saints  fan tell me  what who dat  means  who dat  plus they were  helping Pac-Man  Jones  would play  oh Pac-Man  Pac-Man  Jones  where were we  did we have  that scene  from two  and a half  men  did we  find one  oh we  actually  found  so we're  trying to  understand  why this  is the  best show 
[00:57:00]  on TV  according to  the masses  people love  it  alright here  we go  two and a  half  men  nice guy  has no  idea how  close he  is to  the wood  chipper  hello  Alan you  home  candy  what are  you doing  here  I thought  I'd surprise  you with  a booty  call  lower your  voice  booty  call  what's a  booty  call  well it's  you know 
[00:57:30]  this is  more the  kind of  thing a  son should  learn from  his father  oh okay  maybe you  should ask  him now  alright  I'm going  to hell  it's a  really sweet  gesture but  this is not  a great time  hey dad  what's a  booty call  oh hey  hey Jake  you remember  candy  sure  hi candy  hi  so what's  a booty  call  I figured 
[00:58:00]  you didn't  want me  telling him  was I  wrong  well  Jake  it means  the  candy  came  by  to  to  do  her  yeah  I don't  see any  laundry  oh my 
[00:58:30]  god  always  the  eye  for  detail  well  you see  Jake  in the  old  west  cowboys  could be  out on  the dusty  range  for months  at a time  superior  right  I'm  looking at  how big  the set 
[00:59:00]  is  if they're  landing  737  to the  living room  nothing  but the  clothes  on their  backs  and they  need to  watch  them  so  what  they  do  is  they  would  go  down  to  the  creek  he  pauses  for one  second  not to  interrupt the  laughs  pause  why don't we  just  fucking  bail  this is  horrendous  this is what  I hate  about television  yeah  how about  this  when the  kid comes in  you're talking  to a chick  go inside  I'll talk  to you a little  bit  I'm busy  yeah  that to me 
[00:59:30]  is what  television is  missing  not that you  can't have  awkward or  made up  situations  but the  fact that  wow  oh boy  the little  guy  the awkwardness  how about  I'll talk  to you later  yeah  I know that  sounds like a  stupid point  it's gonna be  what's up  your ass  in a second  if you don't  get out of  here  and let me  fuck this  broad  or something  that harsh  but meaning  that every  relationship  on TV  is so  unrelatable 
[01:00:00]  to relationships  in real life  it doesn't help  that the kid  looks like  he's 17  years old  he knows  what a booty  call is  exactly  maybe if  the kid  was like  I don't  know  five or  six  this kid  looks like  he's a  teenager  ready  it's two  and a half  men  get it  he's the  half man  yeah but  sex is  awkward  oh god  it's what  it's you know  they should just  replace him with a  double amputee  two and a half  men 
[01:00:30]  rolling around  no jokes  at all  but it's  it's  it's  it's  all cutesy  um  fake awkwardness  silly  yeah  yeah it's  it's that  well  it just goes  on and on  well let's see how  it's less than a minute  hopefully the self  inflicted gunshot  awkward  let's go  let's see how  this booty call  thing ends  until they were  wearing uh  nothing but  their boots  why'd they keep 
[01:01:00]  their boots on  you get it  rattlesnakes  uh  anyway um  in order to  to warn  uh  people who were  swimming  that you know  the naked  cowboy  was uh  on his way  he would yell  or uh  or if you will  uh call  um  booty  booty 
[01:01:30]  ergo the booty call  wow  alan  you really make  history fun  well thank you  so when did it  start meaning  casual sex  that's the butt slide  um  why don't you  go play a video game  or something  okay great  hey candy  you wanna come to  my birthday party  tomorrow  sure  how old are you 
[01:02:00]  gonna be  12  happy bar mitzvah  how to show  on tv  there you go  11 year old  doesn't know  what a booty call  is  dude i started  checking my twitter  and i'm  we're trying to do  the bit  i'm sitting here  trying to watch  i i bailed  that is  horrid  it's the number  one show  they win awards  there are people  i've heard from  people that say  it's a funny show  and i look at them  and i lose  all respect  there might be 
[01:02:30]  i'm sure there's  funny moments on it  i mean  it's it's not that  it has to be as so  edgy you can't put  it on tv  but it's every show  yeah  has the same  unbelievable  relationships  and the same  unbelievable  interactions  always  my problem is  they're all the  same show  i agree  and they're all  good looking  exact same formula  it's so stupid  but sanford and son  all in the family  when you get up to  tax  even mary tyler moore  didn't have  i mean mary was  cute but ed asner  was awful looking  uh ted knight was 
[01:03:00]  ugly gavin mcleod  was ugly  good times  they were fucking  homely  of course  it's the obsession  with making people  pleasant to look at  in pleasant giant  apartments  and it is just  abominable  the dialogue  delivery is as  bland as a  edward norton  phoner  oh wow  oh let's go to  bud the trucker  buddy  what's up bud  hey  good morning  happy birthday  jimmy  thank you buddy  what are you hauling  there bud  um  the mash episode  with no laugh track  was the highest rated 
[01:03:30]  mash episode ever  oh was it  i didn't know that  really  yeah i think it won  a couple awards  um  that's the one where  hot lips showed her  pussy  yes  um  and i think the reason  that the uh  you know two and a half  men does so well  it's mindless  entertainment  you don't have to  you don't have to be  intelligent to watch it  you don't have to  have a brain  you just sit there  and kind of tune out  dude you didn't have to  be you didn't have to  be a genius to enjoy  taxi  you know what i mean 
[01:04:00]  it was like and i'm  not saying that that  was a perfect or  flawless show  i'm basically just  going with louis  who i think is the  best sitcom character  ever and uh  jimmy natowski was  great  latke got a little  hokey but he was  funny when he did  vic because there  was some really funny  shit as vic ferrari  sure  there was some really  funny moments on that  on that show  you gotta look at what  they're producing for  the masses and you  know look at the  people that are  watching it if it's  a number one show  you know look at  nascar how many  people watch that 
[01:04:30]  and it's just  mindless entertainment  going around and  around and around  so you know i think  they dumb it down  and it's just  something you can  watch without having  to think  yeah i don't know  man that's maybe  that's part of it  but all right  yeah thanks  i'm not saying that  they should be  intellectually so  great it's just  that there's this  forced it's an  unbelievable fantasy  world niceness  it doesn't make  sense to me  and the laugh track  is just  again every other 
[01:05:00]  second  what do they feel  like if there's  just silence  that's bad  very bad  i love louis ck  for never allowing  the laughs to be  sweetened  even seinfeld did  all the sitcoms  do even like i'm  sure that that got  laughs a lot of  laughs but they  just they they  temper it and they  they just they  raise and so it  sounds flawless and  groucho said that  the laugh track  ruined comedy  because you  didn't have to  be funny he's  right you don't  get that when you  do stand-up  he's no fucking  laugh track  you know what i  would love to do  it it's impossible  you take the  laugh track out of  that i want to i  want it i want to 
[01:05:30]  hear that exact same  scene without a  laugh track for it  would sound so  awkward and dry  that's why the  british office is so  amazing because it  didn't use a laugh  track it just let  those moments hang  there like they do  in real life thank  god because that's  the way that worked  because it was so  uncomfortable and  funny you didn't  need to you didn't  need to know where  the fucking laugh  it's a funny show  i'm alan partridge  alan in uh it's not  you're right i never  heard of it i'm sorry  we interviewed steve 
[01:06:00]  coogan it's it was in  in england they use a  laugh track though it  was a weird show about  a guy who was a radio  show host uh and uh it  was a very very funny  show but they used the  laugh track in outside  scenes and it did  actually work for the  show yeah but it  probably would have  been better without the  laugh track all right  we're gonna find out  what uh who dad is  all about uh mike in  new orleans what's up  mikey good evening  congrats on your  saints and i i hope  they beat the cults  ah fuck the saints i  don't like them  anyway  showed me

[01:07:00]  oh right your city's  known for that that's  terrific who dat say  they gonna beat them  saints and then this  guy writes it means  who says they can  beat the saints as a  rhetorical rhetorical  question the response is  nobody that's awful  man thank you uh let's  go to chris on long  island chris first of  all fuck you guys for  totally do last night i  was humming it after the  replay oh we got a new  version of totally do  that came in from uh dj  damage that we're gonna

It's funny, it's funny, everybody, it's funny, see, see, see, see, now it makes sense.  So I wasn't sure if it was funny until then.  Well, no, it's funny, Anthony, yes.  We got delays on Tiger Woods. 
[01:11:00]  It's everywhere, but it's pretty much the story that we told everybody when this whole thing hit.  Front page of the paper once again.  Yes.  Tiger's back on the front page.  He's back and better than ever.  So, this is how it went down.  We'll get right into this.  November 25th.  Tiger Woods warns his wife, Elan, the National Enquirer will claim he's having an affair with New York Party girl, Rachel...  You can tell.  Yeah.  Ah, the old head-em-off-at-the-pass thing. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  He knew this was coming down, figured he'd go to the wife and go, I'm going to explain this first, so that when the story comes out, he goes, see, I told you.  Why would I tell you if it wasn't fake?  He persuades his wife to call her, who insists they're just friends.  So, Rachel gets on the phone with Elan and goes, yeah, yeah, we're just friends.  You know, the story that's coming out is bullshit.  Do you think Elan just went, oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  All right, I believe you.  Sorry to bother you.  Yeah.  November 26th, the next day, Thanksgiving Day, Elan learns the Enquirer is reporting Woods and Ukatel rendezvoused in Australia. 
[01:12:00]  That evening, they argue, Tiger and Elan argue, Woods takes a sleeping pill.  Oh, this is exactly what we say happened.  Yeah, he took one of those Ambien.  So, November 27th, pretty much the same day.  It's just, it was one in the morning, obviously.  So, a few hours later, let's call it, around 1 a.m., Elan takes Woods' phone while he's sleeping.  And, pretending to be him, texts Rachel, who texts back.  She then calls Rachel, who answers, thinking it's Woods. 
[01:12:30]  Oops!  Yeah.  And, what she texted Rachel was this, I miss you, when are we seeing each other again?  Oh, what a rookie.  Oh, what a rookie.  Oh, did he screw up.  You're talking about the guy that, you know, had a grown cloth.  Yeah.  So, that's what Elan did.  She didn't believe Tiger, so she grabbed his phone while he was sleeping and texted, making believe it was Tiger.  Why the fuck would you leave your phone with, what are you doing? 
[01:13:00]  Like, what are you doing?  She was so aggravated.  What a dummy.  And, did you hear some of the texts that she read?  Elan found some old texts.  Oh, boy.  Some goodies.  It wasn't good.  Some goodies.  I think it should be in that story of the post.  Oh, really?  Some details.  All right.  So, yeah, Rachel thinks it's Woods, so she writes back, and then all hell breaks loose in the Woods' mansion.  And Elan screams, or screams Woods out of his pill-induced stupor. 
[01:13:30]  So, he's fucking out on Ambien.  Oh, man.  She's yelling, screaming.  He wakes up from his pill-induced stupor.  Woods grabs his phone, locks himself in the bathroom, and texts Rachel.  When he comes out, Elan punches him repeatedly.  Wow.  I wonder if that's when he left the phone.  I wonder if that's...  Oh, no, that's not.  He goes like this.  But the lie unraveled hours later when a still suspicious Nordgren allegedly found a text to you could tell on her husband's phone that read, 
[01:14:00]  You are the only one I've ever loved.  Oops.  Maybe that's not a good one.  Well, friends always do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the way friends are.  Punches him repeatedly when he gets out of the bathroom that he locked himself into.  And then, 2.25 a.m., Woods flees the mansion without his shoes and jumps in the SUV.  Elan gives chase, brandishing a golf club, and smashes a window in the car, which Woods then crashes into a fire hydrant and a tree. 
[01:14:30]  And that's what we said, that he was fucking fleeing because he probably woke him up from a deep sleep by hitting him or yelling at him.  God, imagine you're in an Ambien sleep and you're just getting punched in the face and you wake up,  What the fuck?  Amazing.  What are you doing to me?  Amazing.  Well, he is stupid.  Man.  Leaving the phone like that?  How do you not have a password protection on your phone?  Not even from your wife, just because you're Tiger Woods.  What if you leave it somewhere, unless you watched him do it and knew what it was? 
[01:15:00]  He's probably so stupid.  It was probably golf.  Golf.  I think his password was golf.  Some dumb fucking word.  Yeah, golf.  Or tiger.  His password is just tiger.  Roar.  Or his birthday.  You know, some shitty easy one.  Fucking dummy.  Yes.  Wow.  So that's finally coming out.  But even though most people sort of figured that out a long time ago, right?  Mm-hmm.  And she's visiting him at sex rehab? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, apparently she said she's going to stick with him, or at least stick with him during  this period, because this is like part of his rehab, so she's acknowledging that this  is part of his rehab.  But after it's done, she could just fucking take off.  Right.  But she's like, I guess, being the dutiful wife.  The dutiful wife, taking the high road, as they say, and then she could ditch him afterwards.  It could also be a divorce thing, too, because then you could say to the judge... 
[01:16:00]  You'd look great in a divorce if you did that, right?  Hey, look, I went through the rehab, and I just couldn't do it.  Like, you know, as opposed to leaving him when he's in trouble.  Let's say hi to Dave, who takes an Ambien every once in a while.  Dave.  Hey, good morning, boys.  What's up?  Hi, sleepyhead.  I am surprised Tiger Woods never...  Never mind even woke up, was even able to drive more than a foot.  That stuff, it...  You can be perfectly fine one minute, and then be passed out.  And sometimes, if you happen to take it, if you have a few drinks, it makes you do some 
[01:16:30]  very odd shit that you don't even remember in the morning.  I woke up one morning, my wife said, well, how are you feeling?  Like, well, what are you talking about?  I was sleeping on the kitchen floor with a coat of the pillow.  There's too many stories, but I can't believe that guy was even able to drive.  Well, he wasn't able to drive.  What's wrong with you, Dave?  Are you on Ambien now?  Exactly.  He drove eight feet and hit a juniper bush and flipped his truck. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  What gives you the impression that he was able to drive?  I can't believe he was able to drive, yeah.  Yeah, you act like he was zipping up and down like fucking Al Cowlings and O.J.  Right.  He did a shitload of damage within, what, a hundred yards?  Yeah.  Nothing.  Gas tree!  Right.  I'm leaving gas tree!  No shoes!  Believe it.  Let's say to even get out of the garage.  I think you can put a toddler in Tiger's car, and the toddler would drive better than Tiger  did that night.  My intestines have done better driving.  Jesus, Dave.  Well, that's the point. 
[01:17:30]  It proves that he was in an Ambien stupor, because then he had to go back to sleep.  He was sleeping when the paramedics showed up, if you remember.  Oh, yeah.  They put the pillow under his head, didn't they?  Yeah.  He went right back to sleep.  Yeah.  He was sleeping on the road.  He probably woke up the next morning and was wondering, what the hell happened last night?  Or heck.  Yeah.  Let's tone it down a little bit.  What the heck?  We got the kids listening now.  We're all about the kids.  All right.  Punch it out.  All right.  Let's go to John in New Jersey. 
[01:18:00]  John.  Hey, what's up?  Hi, John.  I'm good.  How's everybody?  We're good.  Good, buddy.  What's up, John?  Get a DUI while on Ambien.  Yeah?  Wait a minute.  How is that possible?  We were painting the living room one night on a Sunday night.  Had a couple beers.  Went out to sleep.  Popped my Ambien.  That was it.  Next thing I know, I crashed into a wall.  Wait a minute.  But it's a DUI? 
[01:18:30]  Yes, sir.  DUI.  But an influence of Ambien.  Were you drunk, too?  I blew under what the legal limit was, but trying to get out of it, I said, oh, it's Ambien.  It's an Ambien.  Sure enough, the lawyer couldn't get me out of it.  Caused me a lot of problems.  Wow, that sucks.  Yeah.  Always keep it quiet.  Yeah.  Yes.  Lawyer up.  That's what I had to do.  All right, sir.  God.  Yeah.  Later, guys.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:19:00]  Jesus Christ.  I thought you'd get away with that.  What?  I don't get the truth.  Like if you're on Ambien.  Yeah.  And you don't blow a...  You don't blow any numbers.  You don't blow to .08.  Sure.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Poor guy.  He's on Ambien.  Just what?  Sleeping?  Yeah.  I wonder how...  And then his wife just comes in and starts pummeling him?  While he's fast asleep. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  I couldn't imagine how that would even play out.  That's terrible.  I would love to hear how that would sound.  That's horrible.  I don't know.  Tiger sleeping.  Oh, God.  You know, tiger sleeping.  Oh, that would be awful.  Guys, probably...  I'll relax.  Oh, I'm so glad I told my wife that's all I about.  The girlfriend.  I think she bought it.  Everything's cool.  I'm going to take a little nap. 
[01:20:00]  Where's my phone?  I'll get it later.  Oh, God.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, I had a dream that I was falling off a cliff,  and my head was bouncing off a rock.  I...  Oh, no!  Oh, my God!  Stop beating!  Oh, my God!  My wife is beating the shit out of me!  Oh!  Oh, I'm sorry! 
[01:20:30]  I didn't do anything!  Dummy.  Leave his fucking phone out.  Well, he's asleep.  He should have been down his pants or up his ass.  As a golf fan, I can't wait for Tiger to come back  because he's going to be shooting 80s.  He's going to be shooting mid-80s.  This guy will never be where he was.  No.  I think it's over for Tiger.  Yeah, all right.  Let's go to Scott and PA.  Scott.  Hey there, Scott. 
[01:21:00]  Hey.  Hey, good afternoon, guys.  Good afternoon.  What up?  Hey.  There's warnings on that product that says you can't take it.  You can't drive with that product.  It also has a sleep warning on it, too, about having sex.  What's wrong with having sex at Ambien?  You don't remember it.  Well, isn't there times you don't want to remember it?  Exactly.  That's all I got, gentlemen.  Yeah, that Ambien is some weird stuff. 
[01:21:30]  It's amazing they actually hand it out.  I mean, I think it's more, it fucks you up more for doing things than I think other prescription drugs that you would think, you know, would be worse.  Like Percocet or whatever the fuck.  At least with alcohol, I think you know what you're doing.  Oh, yeah.  You drive and you go, oh, I'm on the wrong side of the road.  You realize.  This is great.  I meant to do this.  I'm not saying that it's not dangerous, but at least you realize what the fuck you, you're still, you're still you. 
[01:22:00]  You're in the moment.  It sounds like the Zambian.  All of a sudden, people have to tell you what the fuck you did.  I talked about that, you know, night cooking that someone would do.  Yes, a girl would go do night cooking.  On Ambien.  Yeah, and then fall asleep.  And she wouldn't remember the next day?  Boil in a bag thing is in the water boiling away.  And then the aluminum pot would actually melt onto the stove and the place is full of smoke.  And, yeah.  And she had no clue?  Very dangerous.  Did she have any clue that she was doing this? 
[01:22:30]  After the fact, when she was wide awake the next day?  No.  No.  That's fucking scary, man.  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know, but that shit fucked you up.  That shit fucked you up.  This is a very good question from Jeff in Rochester.  Jeff?  Yeah, I want to know why that little white bitch is of being arrested for domestic violence.  Put the shoe on the other foot.  Tiger's in fucking jail.  I'll tell you why.  Because he didn't press charges.  And I guess...  It doesn't matter. 
[01:23:00]  I'm...  The cops didn't know what happened.  Yeah, they didn't tell him.  There was no call of domestic violence.  It wasn't like there was a call made saying there's domestic violence.  It was a car accident call.  And someone called and said a car hit a tree.  And then someone went, what happened?  Yeah, it wasn't like he called and said my wife's hitting me.  Yeah.  And then they shut up and didn't talk to the cops, if you recall.  And after that, it was just chalked up to an accident.  All right. 
[01:23:30]  He didn't want his wife going to jail.  Are the cops allowed to open up the investigation now?  No.  Because of this?  No.  Nothing was...  Okay.  Ex post facto.  You like how this lawyer just think he got me, though?  Yeah.  He goes, does it matter?  You're out of order.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve in Florida.  Steve.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm a man of leisure.  I'm catching some rain.  Here in Fort Lauderdale.  Yes.  Just driving to work. 
[01:24:00]  A couple of years ago, first started taking Ambien.  My wife says, what were you doing last night?  So what do you mean?  Why are there chocolate-covered pretzels on the counter?  I'm like, what?  But there was a double bar, barrel down some chocolate and covered some pretzels with it  at like 4 o'clock in the morning.  Didn't remember doing it.  Jesus.  That's not exactly a horror story, sir.  But it is.  People wake up in prison for the rest of their life because they hit a family with their car.  Or this guy's like, one time I dipped pretzels in chocolate, I have no memory of it.  Wow, you wild man. 
[01:24:30]  It's crazy.  I woke up late one time on Ambien.  I had some strawberries and whipped cream.  Get out of here.  What happened?  You're lucky to be alive, sir.  Did you really forget to put the milk back in the fridge once?  Oh, God.  Get to a meeting.  It is fucked up, though, that you can cook and not have a memory of it.  That was the worst story ever.  One time I had a delicious mixture and made myself a treat.  All right.  Take that stuff and just go to bed.  That's what's the biggest problem. 
[01:25:00]  If people stay up and watch TV and then it's like...  Well, what you got to do is you take the Ambien and then you have someone strap you down to the bed  so you don't start walking around and doing shit.  And making Rice Krispie Treats and dangerous things of that ilk.  Right.  Things of that ilk.  Well, thank God you made it, sir.  All right.  Let me say hi to Eric in Boston.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  Quick comment.  And I'm surprised Tiger didn't have a whole phone.  No whole phone for Tiger, Jimmy.  He's a dope.  Doesn't everyone have a whole phone? 
[01:25:30]  I don't.  Well, if you're going to be banging over 100 broads, the rumor is it's up to 100.  Wow.  Could be up to 100.  Yeah.  You would think if that's going to be your world, you would get a phone or something.  Maybe that was his work phone.  Maybe he had a phone for personal and work and would use the other one.  Maybe he was using that as a shady phone and she kind of suspected.  Who knows?  I doubt it.  I bet he had one fucking phone and just was...  It's because it sounds like he wasn't really being very careful. 
[01:26:00]  Was it a Blackberry or an iPhone?  I wonder.  Blackberry, I think.  Oh, the Pope had a whole phone.  Doodly-doo.  I don't think so, but...  The Pope can't have a whole phone.  A whole phone?  Oh, the Pope likes cell phones with big numbers.  Doodly-doo.  That's more accurate.  Oh, the Pope has a funny ringtone.  Doodly-doo.  Does he?  Yes.  It's the devil going, ow, it's hot, it's hot.  And he laughs when he hears it.  Yeah, good for you. 
[01:26:30]  Adam in Jersey.  How you guys doing?  Hey, what's up, Adam?  Hey, did you hear about this other...  It's like the competitor to Ambience.  And they have this commercial on, and they go through the disclaimers.  It's the funniest thing in the world.  Suicidal disease.  You may choke and die in your sleep.  You've got to get this and play it.  It's hilarious.  Well, what product is it for?  Then we can...  Oh, Lusinesto.  Oh, Lusinesto.  Okay, we'll try to find it. 
[01:27:00]  Actually, the disclaimers for the drugs that they're selling on TV, they are...  It's hilarious.  The shit that could happen to you after they tell you how great this pill is.  Yeah.  And then they run through all the crap.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  Nothing's better than the Yaz one.  What?  The Yaz, the fucking...  What's the Yaz one?  It's a birth control pill for women.  Right.  And the list they go through is everything from...  It might give you a slight headache to an alien will burst out of your chest.  Like, it's everything. 
[01:27:30]  Heart attacks, strokes, don't smoke on it, don't try to walk, don't do anything.  Now I've got to hear this.  Just lay there and fucking not get pregnant.  Now I've got to hear this.  Yeah, it's really like...  Have you ever did the disclaimer bit on our show with these drugs they sell on TV?  Because they're all hilarious.  Yeah, and there's so many now.  It's unbelievable, the shit that could happen to you.  You have chronic dry eye.  ...9% effective and can give you shorter, lighter periods.  But there's one pill that goes beyond the rest.  It's Yaz.  Can we hear that out there? 
[01:28:00]  More and more women are turning to...  A little love.  Sorry, guys.  Yaz is the only birth control.  Yeah.  ...to treat the emotional and physical pre-menstrual symptoms that are severe enough to impact your life.  And it also helps keep skin clear.  Yaz contains a different kind of hormone that may increase potassium.  So you shouldn't take Yaz if you have kidney, liver, or adrenal disease because this could cause serious heart and health problems.  Tell your doctor if you're on daily long-term treatment for a chronic condition like cardiovascular disease or chronic inflammatory disease. 
[01:28:30]  The pill does not protect against HIV or STDs.  What?  Serious risks include blood clots, stroke, and heart attack.  So women, especially over 35, shouldn't smoke because it increases these risks.  Talk to your healthcare professional and find out if Yaz is right for you.  Is Yaz right for me?  Oh, my God.  It's crazy shit.  Blood clots, strokes.  Heart attack, strokes, blood clots, fucking...  What the hell?  Fuck that.  Just get the vacuum cleaner. 
[01:29:00]  It's easier.  Yeah.  It's less painful to kick her down the fucking steps.  Right.  Uh, let me say hi to Ray in Kalamazoo.  Hey, boys.  Go Kalamazoo!  What's up, Ray?  Hey, when are we going to get E-Fat, I mean E-Rock, to take Ambien for the show?  Hey, can we have someone on Ambien for the whole show?  Oh, that would kick ass.  I think that prescription is from Steve.  It'd make a great payback for blowing you off the other weekend.  That's not a bad idea. 
[01:29:30]  I kind of like that.  Let's say hi to Bill the Trucker.  Bill?  Hey, what's up, Bill?  What's up, Bill?  My wife took Ambien one night and ate a half a pint of Ben and Jerry's and then blamed  me for it in the morning.  She saw the empty pint container on the nightstand and blamed me for eating it after eating it.  Another wild story.  Exactly.  You're denying that she has lactose farts?  What finally happened?  One time my wife ate the ice cream and blamed me. 
[01:30:00]  That's just like the shiny when Danny had his sweater ripped.  So when do you think maybe we should take Danny to a dietician?  I think maybe he ate the ice cream by himself.  His awful USA shirt with a rocket on it.  Oh, it was adorable.  This is an Apollo shirt.  Come on, guys.  These Ambien stories are terrific.  Did our wires cross for the morning zoo radio show?  This morning?  I got so fucked up one time that I put the standard side pillowcases on the king pillows. 
[01:30:30]  Come on, stop it.  That's correct.  These stories are horrible.  All right, you know what, though?  Leave it to Philly.  Philly's going to pump up the stories with this one right here.  Doug in Philly.  Doug?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Good day, Jimmy.  All right, Doug?  I took an Ambien about a year ago and I had a couple beers, which it says right on you're  not supposed to do it.  So I woke up with my girlfriend slapping the shit out of me because I was pissing on the  night table.  And there was a toilet. 
[01:31:00]  See, now we got a good story.  Just pissing anywhere but the toilet.  It's just funny.  It's always funny.  In your house.  All her comic books.  Just everything was splattering onto the bed.  I was all fucking...  Oh, that's awesome.  Punch it out, boy.  Thanks.  All right, man.  Wow.  I didn't know they did this.  Mike in Fort Trump.  Hey, Mike.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hello, Mike.  Yeah, are you there?  I am.  Yeah, right here with you. 
[01:31:30]  Hey, when you deploy, that's what they give you on a plane.  So you leave your home base.  They pass out Ambien to everybody.  You wake up in Kuwait or Baghdad, it's 150, and you're like, what the hell did I get  myself into?  They give you training and everything else does nothing.  They have to drug you in order to get you over there.  Yeah, and God forbid if there's an air emergency, everyone's going to be knocked out.  Mr. T?  There's not going to be any heroes on that flight.  Sure. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  It's called Bravo Sierra.  You don't think that's true, Ant?  Oh, why would they do that?  Maybe they give it to you if you need to sleep when you're flying.  They might go, well, yeah.  B.A. Barakas.  Don't like to fly.  Making a whole new A-Team movie, too.  Rampage is in it.  Is he?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah?  What's he playing?  He's playing Mr. T.  Is he Mr. T?  I thought it was another black guy.  Maybe he was playing a bad guy or something.  Ralph's got a fine story.  Ralph?  What's up, boys? 
[01:32:30]  Good morning, Jimmy.  My wife, I didn't realize how strong Ambien was, so she gave me a lot of things.  I was going one night because I was having trouble sleeping.  Next thing I know, she's interrogating me from what she said.  And as she's interrogating me, I basically stopped breathing for 35 seconds to the point  she had to punch me in the side of the head to weight me up.  That's how strong this stuff is, and I'm 260 pounds.  She is.  That shit will fuck you up.  Yeah.  Yeah, it really is.  Hey, can we go back to that birth control commercial? 
[01:33:00]  Because Anthony from Jersey has a very good observation that I think we missed out on.  Anthony.  Yeah, did you guys notice in the background they were playing Goodbye to You in an upbeat  club?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Goodbye.  Goodbye to you.  Later.  Being played in the birth control commercial.  Goodbye to you.  Holy shit.  Okay, now we've got some sexy stories coming in.  Jennifer from Louisiana.  Are you into the Saints or what, Jennifer?  Yeah, who dat?  Who dat? 
[01:33:30]  Well, first off, my 18-month-old daughter was in the car when Jimmy's Who Did They Do song  was playing, and she was humming along to it.  Aw, that's a dark uncle.  And also, I took Ambient for a little while, and then one night, one morning I woke up, and  my husband was like, you know, he asked me, what was with you last night?  And I was like, what are you talking about?  He was like, we have sex, you don't remember?  I was like, are you serious?  And so I've had sex on Ambient, and I've heard about other people having sex and cooking  dinner while on it, too.  And you couldn't remember? 
[01:34:00]  How was the sex on the Ambient?  I hear it's pretty good.  I couldn't remember.  I guess it's kind of like a roofie.  I couldn't remember.  Yeah, wow.  I don't know the sound of that.  Nothing wrong with not remembering, right?  What even says on the bottle that you should be where you're going to sleep once you take  it.  That's how fast it reacts.  Really?  Anybody take Ambient in this room?  I've never had.  Butcha?  Butcha has Ambient stories?  Really?  Bring Butcha in, man.  I want to hear about the Zambian.  Yeah, punch it out.  Thank you. 
[01:34:30]  Let's go to Rich in Connecticut.  Rich?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Last year, I flew into Vegas.  Had a couple of five-hour energies.  I couldn't sleep for two days.  One of my buddies gives me an Ambient.  I have $500 in my room.  I wake up the next day with $16,000, having no idea how I want it.  Nah, come on.  I've done that before.  No Ambient involved.  I have no idea how I mean it.  Ambient.  Memory loss, please. 
[01:35:00]  Sleep, please.  Yes.  Blackout.  He has no idea he won the money.  I hope it was because he turned into a sloppy party bottle.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We got Butcha in studio.  Butcha, you take this Ambient?  I can't get enough of Ambient.  It is the greatest thing that has ever been prescribed on the face of the planet.  Really?  Sex on Ambient is unbelievable.  It can go either way. 
[01:35:30]  It will be the best sex you've ever had or you have absolutely no recollection of what  happens.  The best part about it is when you take it, if you try and fight the sleep, you get this  mild mushroom trip.  Everything starts morphing in front of you.  If you talk on the computer, your screen will start blowing up and breathing at you.  How long does it take you to fall asleep?  It usually kicks in within the first 10 minutes.  What?  Yeah.  Damn, how fast?  Yeah.  If you take it on an empty stomach, it'll kick in immediately. 
[01:36:00]  How long does it last for?  Six hours, I think.  Yeah.  They say about six hours.  They have this new one, Ambient CR, which is like a double pill.  Fucking drug companies rule.  Yeah.  It'll knock you out.  One part of the pill knocks you out and the other part of the pill keeps you out.  That one I haven't taken yet.  I want to try that one, but it's absolutely amazing.  How do you feel when you wake up?  Do you have a little hangover?  When you first started taking it, yeah, but I've been taking it for like, you're supposed  to take it for 30 days.  I've been taking it for like three years.  I mean, this job is very demanding. 
[01:36:30]  You know, I have to be up at three o'clock in the morning, which means I have to be asleep  at like 8, 39 o'clock, which is impossible.  So you take the Ambient, it knocks you right out.  But now it's more of a...  Recreational.  Yeah, I love it.  It's the best.  He makes it sound fun.  It's so good.  I highly recommend it.  You know, just tell your doctor you have insomnia, even if you don't, and just get that shit.  It's so fucking good.  You know, Brother Elmo is a fan of the Ambient.  Yeah?  Now that I think about it.  Yeah, he likes his Ambient.  Because he wasn't able to sleep.  Yeah, I have...  Even sex on it. 
[01:37:00]  Take one and have sex with your chick.  And like that girl was saying, you don't have any recollection sometimes.  You'll wake up.  So you have to take the pill and start the fucking right away.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  If it only takes ten minutes.  That's the whole problem.  Sometimes you'll have difficulties getting a boner on it, and that can be...  Well, how about you have the boner first, then you take the Ambient.  Exactly.  That's what I've been doing.  Let's work it out here.  Yeah, you take the Ambient.  It's easy to figure out.  Then you start the finger popping, and then we'll see what happens.  Does your dick work on Ambient?  Yeah, I mean, you know, depending on how quick you get started at it, you know.  If you wait after that ten minutes, and that Ambient kicks in, and then you try getting 
[01:37:30]  hard, it'll just be flopping around.  Dude, my cock would hang like a little piggy tail.  You got Ambient on you right now?  Not on me, but...  We should all take an Ambient and see who's the last man standing.  Oh, my God.  That'd be great.  Somebody said, would you give E-Rock an Ambient?  I would happily bring in E-Rock an Ambient.  The best thing is, it's like a truth-like thing.  You'll do shit that you won't even purposely want to do.  Like, I've sent out videos.  I've had videos of me getting my dick sucked, and I've sent them out to all my friends.  And then they tell me the next day, they're like, do you know you sent me this video? 
[01:38:00]  And I'm like, what video?  And everybody's got a video of me getting my dick sucked.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you'll tell people, like, girls, like, if you don't have the balls to tell some girl  that you're in love with her, you will fucking pour your heart out if you're talking to  on Ambient.  And that's what I thought Tiger did.  I thought he, like, actually openly told his wife that he was cheating.  Yeah, fuck this shit.  Oh, maybe that was part of this whole thing.  Because that's totally, that's exactly what the type of shit that happens.  Just because they're saying that's how it went down in the paper today, I'm not buying 
[01:38:30]  it completely.  Yeah, it's definitely, I mean, because you'll get, if E-Rock starts talking.  Tiger might be just cursing Ambient.  Yeah.  Saying, mom, it was the fucking Ambient.  Yeah, it's like a truth serum.  It's like a, it's like a acid trip.  It's everything jammed into one little tiny pill.  It's great.  I've never had a problem sleeping, so it's like, I've always had a problem sleeping.  I can't get it.  Yeah, my girlfriend doesn't take pills.  She just, I have 10 milligrams, and she takes a half, and she trips the fuck out.  It's excellent. 
[01:39:00]  It is excellent.  Highly recommend it.  Highly recommend it.  I love that you sent out a video.  Yeah.  Your dick sucked to all your friends.  All right.  Yeah.  Awesome.  Butch, everyone.  Thank you.  Uh, we got Steve, uh, checking in.  Steve?  Yes.  I took Ambient, and I woke up, and I was doing prejudctions.  Let's go to Mike in Indiana.  Mike?  Hi, gentlemen.  Hey, Mike.  I had my wife wake me up. 
[01:39:30]  I was naked, sitting in the car, in the driveway, and she wakes me up in the morning and tells  me to get my ass in the house before the kids come out to get on the school bus.  Why were you naked in the car?  Don't beat the hell out of me.  I didn't have alcohol.  I guess I was going to go somewhere.  Wow.  Beat the hell out of me.  All right.  Well, the other side of this Ambient, John in Tennessee.  Uh, John.  Hey, how you guys doing today?  Good, man. 
[01:40:00]  Hey, good.  Hey, I've been on Ambient for about a year and a half, um, and I take two 10 milligrams  out for tonight, and I take, uh, Oxycontin and 15 milligrams of Oxycodone, and, uh,  Klonopin every night.  I've had, like, massive back surgery.  So, I've been on, uh, 120 milligrams of Oxycontin for the past two years, and Ambient don't  seem to fuck with me at all.  I mean, I'm not going to go to sleep at all, so I'm on four different narcotics.  What kind of back surgery?  Like, in Predator? 
[01:40:30]  I mean, you would think of fucking Oxycontin all night, yeah, but somebody goes to cut the  Tylen's up to it, and it just doesn't fuck with it anymore.  But, uh, you know, you only go to a high on that.  Yeah.  But, with these Ambient stories, I don't know where they're coming from.  I just, I mean, it doesn't put me to sleep, man.  I mean, I take two, uh, two chalps tonight, 20 milligrams a night, and I just, I'll sit  there and still watch TV.  Jesus.  All right.  This guy's on some shit.  No kidding.  But, if anything, the Klonopin's better than Ambient, so, uh, if you want to switch over, 
[01:41:00]  Klonopin's better.  Oh.  Fuck.  I try to stay away from the pills.  No pills.  Let's go to Jared in Louisiana.  Who dat, Jared?  Who dat?  Hey, fellas.  What up?  Well, no shit this guy can, uh, has a tolerance.  He's taking fucking four of the best pain reliefs in the world.  But, anyway, um, I was living with my mom a while back, and she was on Ambient, and I  walk out about two o'clock in the morning, and she's sitting in the dark in front of a mirror, 
[01:41:30]  and I ask what she's doing, and she says, I'm watching myself age.  Ugh.  Mm-mm.  Yeah.  So, this is some serious shit.  Yeah, they prescribe it like it's nothing, too.  Look at the phones.  Yeah, it doesn't seem to be like everybody's on it.  Look at the phones.  Amazing.  Now, I know why everyone's listening to us.  They're all half asleep.  Look at these calls coming in.  This is a good one, actually.  Christine.  What's in it?  Melanin?  Melanin?  Christine in Connecticut. 
[01:42:00]  Come on.  Christine.  Yeah, I took Ambient for a short period of time, and my husband loved it because I was  one of the people who stayed awake on it, and I would drink on it as well.  Ooh.  And he said that I would turn into a porn star, and he couldn't wait until I said, you know,  I think I'm going to take an Ambient.  And he'd be like, all right.  But, I mean, things that I don't normally do, like the ass and various other things.  Oh, wow.  Nice.  Wait.  What do you mean, the ass? 
[01:42:30]  There's a lot of things you could do with the ass.  Well, I would let him fuck me in the ass.  There you go.  Okay.  You needed some clearing up.  There you go.  Yeah, boy.  All right.  So, yeah.  I thought you might have been talking about a little finger.  Yeah.  A little fingertip or something.  No, I mean the real thing.  No, right in.  Right in, huh?  Driving.  You and who are you?  I just did it, yeah.  I don't remember any of it.  You had to remember the next morning.  Sure.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  There was blood and shit all over the sheets.  The next morning, sure. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, God.  You're not on the Ambient anymore?  No, I just needed it for short term.  I had some shit going on.  Now I say fine.  Your sheets look like somebody's fucking rolled over on some chocolate-covered cherries.  Got some shit going on someone's dick.  Colon, please.  Well, Christine, thank you.  We want to hear from the women.  We know they're out there.  Call the fucking show. 
[01:43:30]  Tell us your Ambient stories.  Chad in Minneapolis.  Chad.  Yeah, I've been prescribed this crap for about three months now.  Can't live without it.  But, uh, driving is, like, not a good deal.  Not recommended, eh?  No, I was doing the one-eyed closed, hoping maybe I'd see single.  You know, like when you get really fucking hammered?  And you close one eye so you can see.  That trick never works.  Yeah, well, the road sign didn't agree either. 
[01:44:00]  And then the next road sign.  And I woke up about ten hours later, and my truck was peeled down the side of my house.  Hmm.  Nice.  Yeah, this is, like, more dangerous than booze.  Oh, yeah.  I think so.  I think some people can actually drive while they drink.  No one seems to be able to drive on Ambien.  No.  You just, it does, you know, you start seeing double and then triple, and then you kind 
[01:44:30]  of pick a lane.  That's nice.  Compound eyes.  You know, it doesn't work.  All right, we gotta go, I mean, I gotta get to all these stories.  They're unbelievable.  Chris and Charlie, listen to this one.  Chris.  Yo.  Hey, buddy.  What's up?  Yeah, I did the Ambien shit just to check it out, trying to do the sex thing.  Didn't work out.  I woke up on top of my truck naked with my thumb on my ass.  And I have a lifted F-150.  I have no idea how I got up there.  Ah.  No idea, huh? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Amazing.  All right, we got a doctor on the phone, Dr. John from Harvard.  Ah, hey, guys.  I love the show.  I just want to say, and you honestly don't have to take my opinion for it, this is the  most dangerous prescription drug out there.  It's going to turn your girl into a porn star, but then after you both pass out, she's  going to turn into the psycho bitch from paranormal activity and throw you into the camera.  The behavior is so unpredictable with these people, you don't know what they're going  to do.  And, of course, they're talking about, you know, the hangovers.  It's really not good stuff.  I mean, it may trip you out, but, you know, just smoke a bowl. 
[01:45:30]  Do something organic.  Don't take that trash.  Yeah?  Doesn't work like the after effects not good, huh?  Well, no.  And, I mean, we sure don't know what the long-term effects of it are.  I mean, it still is a relatively new drug.  Apparently you get fucked up or die before there's long-term effects anyway.  In a car wreck or your wife beats you with a golf club.  He's a doctor.  Thanks for the charity, Doc.  Yeah, thank you, Doc.  Let's go to Adam in Princeton.  Adam.  Yeah, Adam.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I work at a, like a psych ward, and we had this kid come in tripping. 
[01:46:00]  He took, like, four or five of them one night, and we were, like, fighting, falling asleep.  This kid started hallucinating.  He was, like, petting cats that weren't there.  He was, like, swatting at butterflies and, like, running headfirst into a wall and shit.  And that's all he was on?  Yeah, I'm thinking he had to be on something else.  Oh, man.  Four Ambien.  They did the blood test and everything.  He just was flipping out.  It was great.  These people are fucked up when they take that stuff. 
[01:46:30]  All right.  Well, Kevin from Connecticut writes, here's me later today.  Hi, Doc.  I'm having trouble sleeping.  Yes.  Hey, you want...  Drinking out of cups.  Some Ambien.  Not me.  No way.  Not once.  Not never.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage?  I bet I have fist.  I bet I have fedelisk.  Barns.  Had a little kid in the background fucking going crazy.  Fedelisk.  Fedelisk.  Fedelisk.  Fedelisk.  Fedelisk.  It just feels like it's fun to say that.  Fedelisk.  I was just saying that the other day for no reason. 
[01:47:00]  Fedelisk.  Fedelisk.  Fedelisk.  Fedelisk.  Should we get Dr. Steve on this Ambien thing?  Dr. Steve would know everything about it.  So, drug commercials with side effects disclaimers.  We got two.  Because these things are just hilarious.  All the shit that could happen to you after they tell you how great the drug is.  Oh, yeah.  First one is for Ambien.  When morning comes in the middle of the night.  Cock.  It affects your entire day.  To get a good night's sleep, try two-layer Ambien CR. 
[01:47:30]  The first layer dissolves quickly to help you fall asleep.  And unlike other sleep aids, a second dissolves slowly to help you stay asleep.  When taking Ambien CR, don't drive or operate machinery.  Sleepwalking and eating or driving while not fully awake with memory loss for the event.  As well as abnormal behaviors such as being more outgoing or aggressive than normal.  Confusion, agitation, and hallucinations may occur.  Don't take it with alcohol as it may increase these behaviors.  Allergic reactions such as shortness of breath, swelling of your tongue or throat may occur,  and in rare cases may be fatal. 
[01:48:00]  Side effects may include next day drowsiness, dizziness, and headache.  In patients with depression, worsening of depression, including risk of suicide, may occur.  If you experience any of these behaviors or reactions, contact your doctor immediately.  Wake up ready for your day.  Ask your health care provider for two-layer Ambien CR.  There's a lot of shit in there, that kid.  Fuck you up.  Damn, man.  Side effects may include an asshole that feels like a truck has been backed into it.  And duty on your bedsheets.  Your wife's teeth missing.  This guy spent three grand on collectibles while on Ambien. 
[01:48:30]  My cousin got a speeding ticket on Ambien and didn't know it until the next day.  Took Ambien and texted one of the...  Oh, this one's good.  Let's go to Carrie in Houston.  Carrie.  Yes, sir.  Hi, Carrie.  Another broad.  We love when the broads fall.  What's up, broad?  I took an Ambien on my way home from work, and by the time I got there, I text one of  the top engineers in my company to send me something filthy so I can get off. 
[01:49:00]  Holy shit.  Chicks are great on this.  Did he?  Oh, my God.  I was so embarrassed the next day at work because I slightly remembered what I did, and apparently  about ten minutes later, I was pissed that he never responded, so I said, never mind,  I'm done.  Oh, he didn't send you anything?  What's wrong with this guy?  What a fact.  Look, it's very inappropriate.  It's not professional.  I was looking at cam girls.  Apparently, I got the job done without him, so no big deal. 
[01:49:30]  Good girl.  Why are you taking the Ambien just before you drive?  It sounds like that wouldn't be a smart thing.  Clip photos, please.  Black cock.  Black cock.  I'd like it to be nine, please.  That's not nine.  That's not nine.  That's Asian in three. 
[01:50:00]  Why do they do that?  Oh, fuck, man.  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  Good story, Carrie.  Thank you.  Let's go to Danny in Jersey.  Danny?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a girlfriend.  She doesn't take Ambien, but she has some weird condition where she falls asleep standing  up.  She'll just rock back and forth.  Narcolepsy?  Before I know it, she's asleep.  She'll drive home. 
[01:50:30]  We'll wake up the next day.  We'll have no idea.  We'll screw in everything.  Jesus.  Jesus.  It's Ambien.  It's some weird sleeping condition.  I have no idea.  I've heard like the narcolepsy where people just nod off.  Sure.  Oh, I thought that was when you just start telling on people.  You're dark.  But her eyes will be wide open.  She'll have conversations.  She just won't remember.  Wow.  Maybe she's just stupid.  Exactly.  You're dating a dope.  Her eye sockets are too small and far apart in her head.  Let's go to... 
[01:51:00]  Thank you, Danny.  Steve Rambas said he married a cow.  She just stands there looking at you with a tongue going up one nostril.  Let's go to Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, we're talking about this Ambien thing.  We think it's the greatest drug ever now.  Oh, it absolutely is.  I wouldn't get any at home if it wasn't for Ambien.  Yeah, what is it?  It seems to be pretty widely prescribed, I guess.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  And it seems to be very dangerous.  Well, you know, those side effects are not uncommon, but they're not in the majority of people, I don't think.  Really?  Yeah, I mean, I've had occasion to take it and didn't have any problems, and I'd say 90% of the people that I prescribe it to don't have any problems with it.  Steve took it, woke up, and realized he had made some real shitty wine overnight. 
[01:52:00]  Exactly.  Instead of using grapes, he used fucking little stepped-on rat shit and grape juice.  He took all the rat duty from the corner and stepped on it, so this will be good vino.  And it wasn't.  He used raisins instead of wine.  Fucking awesome.  Goddamn.  Yeah, but there is a significant minority of people that have these crazy effects from it.  It's a sedative, hypnotic, and it's almost as if you're asleep before your body's actually asleep, and people just say and do crazy things on it. 
[01:52:30]  Now, the number of people that actually get in the car and drive around are really in the minority,  but the few that just say dopey things or do things and don't remember them the next day are, you know, a significant number of people.  What is it?  Like, is it opiate-based, or like, what kind of drug is it?  Well, it's in a new class, but it works on the, oh, it's this gamma-amino-butyric acid receptor. 
[01:53:00]  Don't worry about it.  There won't be a quiz.  But it works on the same pathway, or some of the same pathways that things like Valium and those kinds of drugs do.  Oh, hmm.  So it's a sedative, hypnotic, and Lunesta and Sonata are in that same class.  Yeah.  They don't seem to cause the same number of problems, or at least you don't hear about them, 
[01:53:30]  but they're not prescribed as often as Ambien, as it's still number one.  Yeah, I guess that's why you get most of the people with Ambien stories.  Dr. Steve, would you like to defend yourself?  Because Stephen S. from Bayshore writes,  Dr. Steve mainly prescribes his podcast for his patients who can't sleep.  Oh, now.  Steve from Bayshore.  Uncalled for.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, Steve.  He's incorrigible.  He's pecking away.  I can picture Stephen Bayshore dressed like Pugsley Adams in his little knee-high shorts 
[01:54:00]  and his little velvet smoking jacket typing naughty things.  Pugsley Adams.  Oh, my God.  With a little tight T-shirt, peck, peck, pecking away.  Oh, that's horrible.  That's classic.  All right, Dr. Steve.  I want to get to a few more of these calls, so thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  All right, we go to Vinny on Long Island.  Vinny.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  Joan quit working for a while. 
[01:54:30]  She couldn't come, and, you know, I had kind of an inferiority complex.  So one night she can't sleep.  She pops the Ambien.  She tells me, you know, start finger-banging me.  Wait, she had 15 orgasms in a row.  Mingy.  I was going to fall off.  Mingy, 15.  My mother puts Ambien in the sauce.  It's all.  We go right to sleep.  Oh, my mother, rest her soul.  She made a Parmesan cheese better than anybody's Parmesan.  Did she?  Did she?  Why are you making fun of me?  I'm not a Mets fan. 
[01:55:00]  Not you.  No, it's all good.  We're just using your ethnicity.  Yeah, 15 orgasms the other day on the Ambien.  There you go.  I don't believe it, but good.  She didn't have 15.  It was just probably one mediocre one.  Every time she went, ooh, he thought she came.  She went, ooh, you come?  Yeah, there's another one.  Let's go to Michelle.  Michelle in Boston, and then we go to the buzzkill next.  Michelle.  Oh, no.  Hey, I used to see things on Ambien.  My mom.  Used to see things?  What kind of thing?  Yeah.  Oh, we're losing Michelle. 
[01:55:30]  Michelle.  All right, Michelle, call back.  We'd love to see what you're seeing on the Ambien.  Yeah, what'd you say?  We go to the buzzkill.  Lydia.  Lydia, what's up?  We're having fun with the Zambien.  Well, I hope I had some fun on Ambien, but I'm calling to remind Dr. Steve that Ambien  interferes with your Delta wave sleep cycle.  Ugh.  What the fuck?  Can you put it in terms of a Disney cartoon?  Yeah.  Do you understand it?  It keeps you from dreaming. 
[01:56:00]  Your Delta wave sleep cycle is your deepest sleep cycle, and also where you have your dreams.  And if you stop taking the Ambien, then you have, like, dream rebound, which can be quite  terrifying to some people.  Kevin from Connecticut says, I take Lydia CR.  I just wanted to add the non-pharmacological side of things.  Oh, have you ever been on Ambien? 
[01:56:30]  Yes, I have taken Ambien.  Oh, Lydia on Ambien, Aunt.  What do you think, huh?  I think she wakes up with her tits full of cum, because everyone just goes, I have to titty  fuck her.  She's on her face, and she actually reaches back and opens her asshole with both hands.  Like, she just digs her fingers in and opens her asshole.  She wonders why it hurts so much in the morning.  Yeah.  That's great.  All right, very good.  Lydia, everyone.  We have the other drug. 
[01:57:00]  What is it?  Oh, for the restless leg syndrome and all the crap that can happen.  Oh, yeah.  All the side effects.  The side effects disclaimers are awesome with these commercials.  Every day, you count on your legs to get you where you want to go.  But when you suffer from restless leg syndrome, your legs don't want to stop, even when you  do.  Annoying sensations can keep you up at night when all you want to do is get some rest.  Fortunately, there's Miropex. 
[01:57:30]  Miropex is a prescription medicine that helps relieve the frequency and severity of many RLS  symptoms, like those irritating sensations and the uncontrollable urge to move.  Sell your legs feel better and you feel better.  Prescription Miropex may cause you to feel drowsy or fall asleep during normal activities  such as driving or to feel faint or dizzy when you stand up.  Tell your doctor if you experience these problems.  If you drink alcohol or taking medicines that make you drowsy or if you experience increased 
[01:58:00]  gambling, sexual, or other intense urges.  Other side effects include nausea.  Uh-oh.  Talk to your doctor about Miropex and RLS.  What?  Because when your legs feel better, you feel better.  Gambling?  I like how they spread out the side effects, too.  Because they know there's just too much shit that can go wrong.  Did they say increased gambling?  Yeah.  Yep.  Maybe somebody's slipping me a mickey.  Do you have restless leg syndrome?  Do this.  And then they show a picture of Christopher Reeve on a horse.  That'll stop it.  That'll put the kibosh on it. 
[01:58:30]  And the old gag that psychotics bring it up.  Where were all these fucking diseases 20 years ago?  No one had restless fucking leg syndrome 20 years ago.  Heather Mills has restless legs.  That's very good.  She takes off the stump.  She takes off the fake one of her stump and plays it like a violin.  She's a real artiste.  Oh, that's good.  Let's go to Mike and Westchester.  We're trying to move on, but the stories are too good still.  Mikey.  How you doing, guys? 
[01:59:00]  Hey.  Welcome aboard.  I got one that Anthony will really appreciate.  First of all, that stuff, the guy called.  He said, oh, I take OxyContin and everything.  It has the opposite effect for me.  So I have to take Ambien to go to sleep because it wakes me up and keeps me up all night.  So one night, now my wife has to take the guns away from me because one night I woke up.  Middle of the night, thought somebody was intruding in my house.  And the police caught me, half naked, running around the neighborhood with an AR-15, trying to find out who was breaking into my house.  It didn't work out well.  That's not very good.  No, that's not good. 
[01:59:30]  You should not have guns out.  Yeah.  And another time, I went outside and built the railing around my deck quite well, actually, and had no idea.  I woke up the next morning, and my wife said, you did a great job.  I said, what?  I looked outside, and the railing was done.  So it does work.  Sometimes you do function pretty well on it.  She's there with a big fucking twat opened up saying, yeah, you built the deck.  Thank you, sir.  We got Dana in Boston.  Someone else fucked her.  Dana.  Dana.  Boys, good morning. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, Dana.  Oh, hi.  I need to, Anthony, can you clarify something for what Dr. Steve said?  Yes.  Did he say that a minority of his patients are on Ambien or all minorities are on Ambien?  Sure seems like it sometimes, doesn't it, Dana?  We'll have to listen to the replay on that.  Sure seems like it.  Let's go to Tommy in Brooklyn.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Welcome aboard, Tom.  What's wrong with the pills we got? 
[02:00:30]  What's some of them, the Ambien?  Berkison.  Lunasta.  Xana.  I've caught.  Valtrex.  Out.  Yeah.  They pill pretty good.  All right.  Pissed on the lawn.  I mean, they're just coming in here.  I guess we can move on.  We can go back to this another day.  So we got Ozzy coming in.  We got Florentine outside the studio.  We have to dine. 
[02:01:00]  We have to take leave.  I'm working on my Ozzy questions.  That's good, Jimmy.  Remember, is Tom alive?  Yes.  He's dead.  No.  Yeah, he died overnight.  What happened?  I don't know.  Hello?  Hey.  Hey.  How are you guys doing?  What's up?  Not much.  I should say, I was describing Ambien.  This is Tom, by the way.  That's why the stupid joke.  Tom, from White Plains.  Obviously, you're still alive and you've got an Ambien story.  Yeah. 
[02:01:30]  And I was picked up by the police because I was in my neighbor's house, naked, barking  like a dog at them.  And, you know, of course, they called the police.  But I didn't have to stay anywhere, fortunately.  Well, more importantly, you sound like you're doing okay.  You're still alive.  Yeah.  What up?  I'm still alive.  Yeah.  I said, there's new medication I'm on. 
[02:02:00]  That's helping me.  And I'm feeling pretty good.  You sound like you're doing a lot better.  Are you driving right now?  I just got out of the car.  I'm walking.  That's his iron lung.  Oh, it works well.  I just want to say hi to you guys.  See how y'all doing?  Yeah, we're doing all right, Tom.  Good to hear from you.  I'm hoping to catch on with Dr. Steve and say hello.  Oh, you want Dr. Steve to help you out now? 
[02:02:30]  What is this?  I just want to say hello.  Is this Dr. Oz?  We're a fucking service for a doctor over here.  We're not a referral service.  What the fuck, man?  We're a mediocre radio show.  Yeah, at best.  I can't.  Are you working, Tom?  Are you getting laid?  Are you living on the ground floor?  What's going on with you?  No, I'm on the third floor, which kind of sucks.  Why are you on the third floor?  If I had your condition, the only thing I would worry about is making sure I'm ground level.  Yeah, I know, but my landlord died there, and I had to move quickly, and this was the only 
[02:03:00]  place I could afford at the time.  Right.  You know, I could have sold my MacBook if I ever got it, but...  Oh, damn.  Didn't you promise him a MacBook?  I don't remember that.  Yeah, you did.  I have it on tape.  What happened with that?  He thought you'd be dead.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, well... 
[02:03:30]  Actually, I did die.  The night of your concert, the PNC concert...  By the time I got night, I was clinically dead.  They had to revive me.  Wait, after a comedy show, you died?  I know a lot of comics died on the stage that night.  Let's not bring up Rich Ross, but...  But, you know, folks... 
[02:04:00]  Wow.  It was a bomb.  That night, I got home.  I couldn't move my legs or arms, and I went to the hospital, and...  Did you call me again?  Yeah, please.  Uh, yeah.  All right, what are we doing?  I'm fucking calling.  Am I going to piss?  You know something?  You are so right.  I was just ready to...  What the fuck is this?  Just call that.  I don't know how to hang up on the guy.  The guy might be dead soon.  Call you to just hang up on the guy. 
[02:04:30]  Paul died.  Who are you talking to, Tom?  I'm ordering coffee.  You're on the fucking radio.  You can order coffee anytime.  Well, I might be dead.  I was like, let the guy go behind.  Oh, my good God.  Now I just want to keep him on the line.  Hey, I keep you laughing anyway.  Well, I have the wrong reasons.  Thank God you've learned how to smile.  Be good.  Be good.  Be good.  He sounds like... 
[02:05:00]  He could be that guy, right?  All right, why don't we take a break?  Jim Florentine joins the program next.  Ozzy Osbourne within the next 15, 20 minutes, it looks like.  No, no, no.  9.30.  Oh, 9.30?  Ozzy's 9.30, yeah.  What is that about?  Yeah, he's 9.30.  Okay, so we've got another hour.  We're back.  We're 9 a.m. now.  8.45.  Oh, really?  It is 8.45.  Did they change it?  Yeah, they did.  Okay.  So 15, 20 minutes for Ozzy Osbourne.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:05:30]  We welcome Jim Florentine to the radio show.  Haven't seen Jim in a while.  Another big Oz fan.  Well, that's why I think he's here.  I don't even think he's promoting anything.  He just wants to say hi to Ozzy who's going to be here in a few minutes.  Hang on with the Oz. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, what's going on, Jim?  Anything?  Not much, yeah.  I mean, definitely.  Just like to be an Ozzy, absolutely.  This is like my...  I think it's my 12th time meeting him, and I'm still like a little kid.  You're just like Jimmy.  I got up extra early.  I made sure.  You got your ECDC shirt on.  Yeah, I didn't want to wear the Ozzy.  I know Jim did, but it's like...  No.  I could.  I got a nice Dyer from Madman shirt to cover.  I just got one of those retro shirts that I wore, yeah.  But he's had enough of me.  He won't remember, but I got some good stories meeting him.  He didn't remember me? 
[02:06:30]  Since like 1981.  Wow.  I met him probably 12 times.  Jim gave me, actually, one of my greatest things.  Fucking Florentine gave me a poster that he had gotten Ozzy, Rudy Sarzo, and Randy Rhodes  to sign in 81, which, you know, Randy's signature on it with Ozzy is very fucking rare.  Yeah, Jim.  Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking, because I want that back.  I know.  I'm so happy he gave me that.  I know.  I was like, what am I going to do with this?  I'm like, you can have it, Jim.  And then I'm thinking, I'm like, what did I do that for?  Why did I do that for?  I had Randy Rhodes' signature.  I got a couple pictures with Randy, though, too.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you give that away.  Good one. 
[02:07:00]  We had Rudy Sarzo on our metal show, and he toured with Ozzy in the Blizzard of Oz days,  and he was telling a story.  Should I bring it up when Ozzy comes in?  I would say when Ozzy's here, because you can confirm it.  Yeah, that's true.  Some good shit stories.  Did you wear the Ozzy shirt on purpose, or did that just happen?  I would have anyway, but it's like, you know, I wear this all the time anyway, man.  It's like, I would wear a Kiss shirt when Ozzy's in, a Sabbath shirt when Kisses.  It doesn't matter.  I have, like, three fucking shirts I wear.  That's all.  Okay, I didn't realize that.  Gene and Paul were here yesterday doing other stuff promoting Kisses, like Dr. Pepper commercials. 
[02:07:30]  So I talked to Gene and Paul, I wanted them to get them to sign this Cream magazine.  Did they?  Yeah, yeah, they were very nice, and they both know me.  Oh, were they?  Yeah, they were.  And it's amazing how I cannot communicate with people that I like.  I can't do it.  Like, because Steve Leeds goes, ah, do you know Jim Norton?  And Gene goes, yeah, he tore my asshole out.  He's like, hey, how are you?  We're chatting.  Oh, good, yeah.  Being very friendly.  And he makes a little joke, and I'm like, huh.  And someone laughed.  He goes, what, he laughed?  You?  Nothing?  Oh, you turn all fucked up. 
[02:08:00]  I'm like, no, but I just, I can't.  You're a child.  Dude.  You turn into a little child.  Paul Stanley walks out, and he goes, hey, the funniest guy I know.  He, like, knew my act.  He fucking, he liked my stand-up.  And I just, I couldn't talk.  My mouth doesn't.  I can, I'm not a 41-year-old.  What, was this cock in there?  I wish it weren't.  At least that would be a viable excuse.  That was blood on him.  I'm not a 41-year-old man around people I like.  Yeah.  It's fucking horrifying.  But there's not too many people you like, though. 
[02:08:30]  That's true.  Not to that magnitude.  Yeah, exactly.  Jimmy, it's all are minimal.  It's like, yeah, that person, eh, they're all right.  And then he'll love someone.  And then there's that weird thing where his agent or manager knows them so he can't fucking  badmouth them.  Or he's hoping they put him in a movie so he's got to make like it likes him, Billy Crystal.  I like Billy.  I like Billy because he was nice to me when I met him.  You hate Billy Crystal as much as we do.  You just can't say it.  You just can't say it. 
[02:09:00]  Mr. Bush.  Publicly.  Get some people to help with the Katrina.  I'm doing my black man act.  A scuba bop.  But you better stop it.  You fucking hack.  God, I hate that shit.  Jimmy loves him, though.  He's very nice to me.  Good.  What's your short list of people that you get really nervous in front of?  It's Gene and Paul.  Gene and Paul.  Ozzy.  I'm trying to think of anybody else.  I don't think there's another person on their list.  I mean, anyone in Sabbath, really, except Bill Ward.  I'm very comfortable with Bill Ward.  Yeah, you were comfortable when you met him, when we met him out in L.A.  Yeah, Bill's just such a sweet, easygoing guy. 
[02:09:30]  Are you going to be all right with Ozzy?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, uh...  You read the whole book, so...  I did.  I love it, too.  You met him a couple of times.  Sharon knows you very well.  Yeah, you know, I texted her yesterday and said, I hope I see you today.  Did you?  Yeah, she emailed back.  I'd love to, but I'm doing a Today Show.  You know how it is when you're friends.  Of course.  But he won't remember me, I don't think.  Thank God that wasn't like he didn't mess it up with another girl that he was texting,  you know, sent her some dirty text.  Sends one to Sharon.  Hey, you know, do you got a turd brewing?  I'm horny.  You probably love it.  Do you got a turd brewing? 
[02:10:00]  Hey, the Ozzy book.  It's good, Jimmy.  I know I'm the fucking rooting for the home team because I'm a fan, but it's...  Dude, it's honestly...  I fucking laughed out loud through the whole book.  It is so much better than I was expecting.  Is it as good as Dirt?  I like this better than any rock biographer I've ever read.  Did you read Motley Crue's Dirt?  Yes.  And...  That was what it was called, right?  Dirt?  That was a very good book.  Yeah.  That was an amazing book, man.  But nobody has fucking better stories of drunkenness.  And you'd like it.  He was an avid gun owner at one point.  I didn't know that.  I learned a lot of shit that I did. 
[02:10:30]  Collector of Nazi memorabilia.  What do you mean at one point?  He doesn't do the gun thing anymore?  I don't know.  I would like to ask if he has guns now because I know that they got robbed in 2004.  He walked in on a burglar when he was taking a piss.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  There's a lot of stuff I learned about it.  Oh, and he collected some Nazi stuff.  Wait, wait, wait.  Lemmy's into that, too.  That's what he said.  Yeah, he gives him the lemmy.  Hold on.  But he walked in on a burglar.  Oh, yeah.  You can't just casually say that.  You didn't know that?  Him and Sharon go,  A turd burglar.  I was in there.  Was it in a hotel?  No, it was his house.  So he what?  Gets up in the middle of the night? 
[02:11:00]  And there's a burglar.  He's pissing.  And he sees a burglar.  Get the fuck out of here.  I don't know the...  So I guess...  Yeah, so the devil's in his house over in England.  And it was in the L.A. house where he was born and said, yeah.  Obviously worked out in his favor because he's still here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm a burglar.  Stop it.  I have a club.  Can't carry a gun or nothing.  The burglar just started running.  Stupid England.  I think Ozzy threw him out the window.  Oh, shit.  Something.  The guy jumped out the window or something.  Or maybe Ozzy threw him out.  He went after him.  He actually went after him, I think. 
[02:11:30]  Some people said that Ozzy threw him out the window because he gave Sharon a foot massage.  And other people said that Ozzy threw him out.  I was in Ozzy's house one time in L.A.  because Jack Osborne used to do the show over in England, some variety show.  And he had me on when I was doing that crank anchors.  And we actually did it in the Malibu house.  Remember that?  They used to have the house on the beach.  They showed it in the Osbornes.  I was in that house.  It was just me and Jack.  We filmed from there.  And I'm in the bathroom.  And I see these towels that say O-O on them and all this stuff. 
[02:12:00]  I'm like, should I steal this stuff?  I'm like, I can't.  I'm like, but I want to.  I just kept going back in.  And I'm like, no one's going to know.  There's 75 towels in there.  But I just didn't do it.  Yeah, you can't steal from someone's house.  I would have.  That would suck.  He had a refrigerator.  It's like one was Ozzy's side.  It had a refrigerator.  One was Jack's.  So he's like, you want sugar-free Red Bull?  You could have one of my dad's.  I'm like, I'll take one of your dad's.  I was just looking at anything.  I'm like, but I just couldn't steal from him.  No, you can't.  I would have went through the septic tank and found a log.  It was a one-in-six shot of his. 
[02:12:30]  Sold it on eBay.  But no, it's like you can't take from somebody's house.  But I understand the temptation.  It's hard.  Two O's on a towel.  Yeah, really?  I'm going to ask him for something today of his.  Really?  Yeah, whatever.  Give you a ring or something?  I don't think he'll give me a ring, but maybe the jacket.  Some of it.  The cross.  Yeah, that'll happen.  Let's say hypothetically you and Ozzy are hanging out.  Sissy wants to hang out.  You go to dinner.  And Ozzy makes a move on you.  What happens?  I mean, seriously.  I would probably go, hey, man.  It's like, you know, it's like there's people here.  I mean, you got a good room, right?  Easy tiger. 
[02:13:00]  I always tell my friend that.  This is a big Ozzy fan.  I go, what if you picked up Ozzy Hitchhike and Ozzy picked you up?  And he said, look, can you just give me a handjob?  And the guy, I go, what would you do?  He's like, I'd just be sad that he asked me that.  I'd be sad.  That's a good answer.  It is.  I'd be fine.  My eye, you know, he goes, I'd just be sad.  With a handful of goo.  Just being sad.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you're almost obligated to help out.  The poor guy's been touring, doing Ozfest. 
[02:13:30]  His fucking stress levels are high.  Every man needs to come in the fucking knuckles of a fan.  I would just be sad.  That's great.  You guys got pictures that you're going to get signed?  I have one photo.  But you have every picture signed by Ozzy.  I wasn't going to bring anything, but the photo I want to bring is of me on the stage  after the tribute.  It's a great shot.  It's got Ozzy, me, Tommy Lee, Billy Bob.  It's all of us.  Let me see that shot.  I haven't seen that yet.  I don't know if you have enough wall space for your pictures.  And I'm not even joking.  And you haven't been to fucking Jimmy's house. 
[02:14:00]  It's starting to look like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  He's got glass cases.  Wow, that's a pretty cool picture.  It's a good shot, right?  Henry Rollins, Ozzy, a slash.  Yeah, Billy Bob.  That looks nice.  Who are the other?  You, of course.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Who's the one guy I don't recognize?  Billy Morrison from the cult.  He and Ozzy are really, really close.  He hosted the tribute.  And it's a great shot.  And the knee on the end, looking completely like an interloper.  Nah, not at all.  Not a place.  But yeah, of course.  But yeah, it's Billy Bob slash Rollins, Ozzy, Tommy, Billy Morrison, and some fucking fat-titted kid from Jersey. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, Jimmy's apartment's being taken over by his memorabilia.  Yeah, the memorabilia.  It's everywhere now.  I can't imagine.  And I haven't been there in a little bit.  So I imagine that.  Well, is the girl into it, Jimmy?  Yeah, she's used to it.  I mean, my ex-girlfriend told me it's like a museum.  She's used to it.  Yeah, see, he's got a grandfather in.  That's the thing.  Yeah, yeah.  He's had it up before.  That's the only way he gets away with it.  He meets some chick, and they're going to go get a house somewhere.  No way that that chick goes up in the living room.  Packed away and put some storage units somewhere. 
[02:15:00]  That's cool, yeah.  When she coughs up 50% of the money for the house, she makes 50% of the fucking wall decisions.  If it's 100 to 0, you get no say in the wall.  You want a mirror in the bathroom?  Fine.  I mean, you've got to be at the point where you have to prioritize and go, I really like  this one, but I've got to hang this one somewhere because I don't have any room.  The majority of my stuff is not hanging.  I actually wasn't.  Last time I saw him in L.A., I didn't get a picture.  I didn't get anything signed.  It's like I see the guy. 
[02:15:30]  What else could you want?  And from everybody else, though.  It's like, you know, you've had shit signed by other artists.  I got a signed Woody Allen picture and me that I don't have up on my wall, really?  That should be right up there.  I know.  I want to get a fight.  I'm thinking.  I put them in good frames, but you've seen my place.  Yeah.  I got my Allen Alder photo.  Yay.  My fucking Carlin photo.  Yeah, he's got glass cases now and everything.  You guys in the Iron Sheik with the piss in the pants.  I had that blown up and signed.  That's a great picture.  I got that picture blown up, too.  Fucking great shot, man.  It's just the ones I really love.  And, of course, Sabbath. 
[02:16:00]  I got to hang the one with us and George Carlin.  I found that recently.  That's a big issue.  You got Kinnison in your apartment?  You got a great one.  I got Kinnison when I was a kid.  Wow.  Yeah, it was in my early 20s.  That's a rare one.  Yeah.  I don't even have my whole family, like, in pictures in my house.  No, no.  I'd rather hang pictures of, like, me with celebrities and my family.  Yeah, me too.  It's more fun.  Yeah, it's more fun.  It really is more fun.  And they all listen to the show.  I'm not trashing them.  But I'd rather see me and Sam Kinnison than, you know.  I'm telling my family, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:16:30]  I know.  On my camera, I got, like, 600 pictures on them.  Christmas, it's all my friends, people puking, naked chicks, or rock stars.  That's all it is.  Childish?  Never.  Never not childish.  Never.  Yeah, I don't have any memorabilia or anything hung up.  Well, the homeless people have your fucking stuff, man.  Well, that was a while ago.  You had a nice collection that you were collecting until, you know, it all went bad.  That was the ex-wife back in the old AAF days. 
[02:17:00]  She took all that stuff and threw it in a fireplace.  Well, dude, you have such a great apartment for memorabilia.  Me and chicks are burning stuff.  Yeah, I know.  I don't understand that.  What the hell is going on?  Your house is perfect for having stuff hanging up, man.  It's amazing, dude.  Especially downstairs.  That should just be filled with pictures.  Memorabilia?  Well, you've got a lot of celebrity pictures now.  Start blowing some of that shit up.  I've got a Luftwaffe officer's hat.  That's good.  That's a good one.  See, I kind of like the era, too, myself.  I like some of the collectibles from the era.  I want to talk to Ozzy about that. 
[02:17:30]  But what's the most valuable thing you've got as far as memorabilia goes?  I'll start.  I've got what I think is a Kurt Cobain autograph, but I'm still not sure.  All right.  That one's questionable.  No, the one.  No, that one's still at the old XM, which is now someone's office.  I bailed on that.  I knew that one wasn't real.  But someone else sent me one and swears it's true.  And I looked it up.  It looks like it could be real.  Most valuable.  I don't know where I can bring it so someone can tell me if it's real or not. 
[02:18:00]  What's the most valuable thing?  You know, nothing great.  I mean, I got the...  To you, though.  It might just be a picture of you and fucking...  The Blizzard of Oz original album.  I got the whole band to sign it.  That's strong.  You know, Randy, Rudy, Tommy, all originals.  And then I also have the Appetite for Destruction original album cover.  Signed by everybody?  No, not signed, but that's really rare.  Oh, the one where they had to switch out because...  Yeah, because the girl was getting raped in her pants down in the cartoon.  Yeah, how many of those ended up in the market before they... 
[02:18:30]  Not too many.  Only like 5,000.  I remember I got that album the first day it came out.  No, I forgot all about that until you brought it up.  That was a big deal when that first hit.  Yeah, because once they started playing Welcome to the Jungle video on MTV,  they started blowing up.  Then they set a switch to the album cover.  Yeah, they recalled all the albums.  Yeah, and there was only like 10,000 out there because nobody knew who they were.  And you have one of those.  Yeah, I got that.  Yeah.  That's pretty big.  Is that one of your guitars, Dan?  Yeah, that's my autograph slash Les Paul.  Oh, okay.  That's a good one.  That's pretty good.  That thing doesn't see the light of day anymore.  It's not...  It was only on that stand just for the picture taking. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  It's in a nice little case tucked away in my closet and it rarely ever comes out.  Don't you want people to see it?  You should display it in a way where they can't touch it,  like they can't do what they did to that Picasso painting.  Well, you know what?  They sell like those shadow boxes, like those big glass boxes,  but for a giant thing like a guitar, they're very, very expensive, like 900 bucks.  It's all off the fucking neck of the thing.  I don't know why I didn't think of that.  Good call.  Like you did to that Sandy Kane chick.  That was the last time I was on the show when you smashed that guitar.  I'm embarrassed though.  That guitar should have shattered, but it was fucking made of cement or something. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, what did you do?  After smashing it as much as I did, I only got a nice size hole inside of it.  It was still just that you did that.  You were fuck creeping around the back like a little kid.  Oh, it pins her off.  It's not getting there.  That was...  Her face was just...  It was precious.  That was a good day.  That was a good day for me.  Jimmy, what about you?  I would say the single thing is my photo at Sabbath, which is my...  From the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Yeah, which is blown up and signed by three of them.  I just got to get Bill to sign it. 
[02:20:00]  But I also have my wall...  Why hasn't Bill signed it?  I haven't seen him since I've gotten it except for that one time and I want to bring it to L.A.  I have on my wall, I have bands, individual shots with the bands and each shot signed.  And those are pretty cool.  I got Metallica, Sabbath, Motley Crue, Kiss, and Motorhead.  Wall on my bedroom wall, like each one signed by...  So that type of stuff is like for me the best.  And it's worth nothing financially.  I don't even know...  Oh, yeah.  It's valueless financially.  Of course.  We're not talking about financially.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  Now, first edition, The Stand, signed by Stephen King.  That's pretty strong.  That's pretty much all I have.  That's pretty fucking strong right there.  But that's like all I have.  And then it drops off real quick.  I have a fucking giant ash doll from Evil Dead signed by fucking Bruce Campbell.  So the drop off from Stephen King's first edition stand to that.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  I got a Reggie Ball signed, which I really like.  I just got that recently here.  That's pretty big.  He signed it to me and I was happy to have him sign it to me. 
[02:21:00]  When did he have testicular cancer?  That's a Reggie Ball.  I'm so stupid I didn't get it for a second.  Hey, someone sells great guitar display cases online, Dan.  Well, I mean, I've done the research.  I mean, some of them are shit.  Really?  You know, I don't want the finish to fade.  You know, you have something with Sharpie, you know, that's just a marker that can go away very easily. 
[02:21:30]  No kidding.  That's an easy smear.  I had an autographed Metallica t-shirt that I just kept in my drawer.  I never even wore it.  And then I took it out like six months later just to look at the autographs and they were gone.  What the fuck?  They just like soaked into the pattern of the shirt or whatever.  I was just like, wow, that really sucks.  Were you bumming?  Yeah.  I was like, dude, that was like, that was like one of the only things I had signed by all of them besides like shitty posters that were all torn up and fucked up.  Just evaporated.  Florentine, are you a big football fan?  Yeah.  Oh, you are?  Yeah, huge. 
[02:22:00]  OK, because they're asking, what did you think of the NFL playoffs?  What did you think of those two games?  I'm just glad that Favre's out of the playoffs.  For real?  A lot of people, sentimental favorite.  The guy's a fucking crybaby drama queen.  He's the worst fucking drama queen ever.  The guy just has to be in the news.  Well, it comes out today.  He's highly unlikely.  Of course.  Of course.  He's saying it's highly unlikely he will return next season.  Of course.  He needs to throw it out there because he's out of the news.  So he needs the attention back on him because it's not going to be for the next two weeks.  Is he going to play? 
[02:22:30]  Is he not going to play?  So he's going to keep doing this.  I just need a few more days with my family.  Stop.  As soon as guys say they're going to go back and talk to their family, they're right back  to playing the sport.  Because they realize, oh, fuck, I don't want to spend the rest of my years with my family.  I could get one more year out there.  Yeah, remember when Michael Jordan retired?  His wife was there.  And she's like, Michael's going to be a father now.  He's going to pick the kids up from school.  Two months later, he was playing basketball again.  He ain't fucking picking kids up from school.  Michael Jordan.  He's not ready for that.  That's a good point.  Because Brett Favre had one or maybe his best year ever, right? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  So he's got another year in him.  And the Vikings were that close?  He's going to play again.  Yeah.  But we'll go through it for the next six months.  But he knows when the cameras are on him.  He knows when to limp.  He knew to just get his ankle taped over and go, oh, what a warrior to come back in.  Like, nobody ever got fucking hurt in a game before and came back in.  Only him.  Only he's the warrior.  Nobody else.  But Anthony was pointing out he took some shots.  He did.  But he got fucking beat up.  He took a few late hits, man.  I love that.  It was just, like, brutal.  He got beat up pretty good. 
[02:23:30]  But two weeks before, the fucking refs are picking him up when he's on the ground.  I've never seen that before in football.  Yeah.  They're helping him up with his fucking hand.  I'm like, what is going on here?  Yeah, the refs aren't supposed to be touching the players ever.  He did it three times in the Dallas game.  I didn't notice that.  Or where they played the week before.  Arizona.  Now, and we argued a little bit.  Do you think he should have ran that last fucking pass?  Yeah.  Instead of passing anything?  Absolutely.  He should have ran.  Because all he had to do was get, what, maybe seven yards, and that's a pretty good  chance of winning the game.  That's what he's doing.  All the Favre haters in Green Bay that had to deal with him for years, that wanted him 
[02:24:00]  out of there.  No, he throws that big pick in a big game like that.  He's been doing it for years.  And he did it the last pick he threw with Green Bay.  It was the Giants.  That's when the Giants went to the Super Bowl.  Right.  It was a dumb play.  You don't throw across the field late in a game.  That's a rookie move.  Even Sanchez didn't do that with the Jets.  I don't understand that fucking, I understand quarterbacks don't want to fuck themselves  up and run into a fucking moose on the field.  But there are so many occasions where you look, they're fucking open to the sideline. 
[02:24:30]  They could run on an angle, maybe make the first down.  They just refuse to fucking cross that line of scrimmage now and run with the ball.  Because you're not going to even get popped.  Because if you slide, they can't touch you.  So you could just slide right before a guy's going to pop you.  Yeah.  So what's the big deal?  And he could have just ran.  Even if he got back to the original line of scrimmage, it was a 54-yarder.  In a dome, he can easily make that.  You don't think Farb's foot was hurt, though?  I thought maybe his ankle was hurt.  That's why he didn't run.  Whenever there was a fumble, he ran.  Believe me.  Fucking stop with that. 
[02:25:00]  I love Jim.  Yeah, he only limps after the play.  If it's a bad play, oh my, I can't, someone help me get off the field.  If he fucking threw a touchdown, he would have sprinted down the field and jumped on the  guys' arm.  Wow, good point.  He's a fucking pussy.  Sick of him.  The whole right side of the field was open on that play.  It was wide open.  But even if he just slits in a line of scrimmage, seven seconds left, 55-yarder, it would  have been in the Super Bowl.  Yep.  And what about the Jets game?  That was a good game, man.  The Jets put up a good fight.  I think so.  I think they played a pretty good game.  I mean, the Colts are just, I hate to say it, a better team. 
[02:25:30]  We were saying, now, the first quarter was like, wow, these fucking Jets, look at this.  And then going into the half, it was like, hey, look at this.  But your voices get a little higher, like, yeah, I think they're going to do it.  All right, it was still, eh.  I started walking.  And then, that's it, the wheels come off.  Yeah.  I was at a christening the first half.  I mean, we all blew off the party, you know, the Jets fans.  We were upstairs, you know, in someone's bedroom because they had a nice TV sitting on the floor.  By mid-third quarter, I was wandering around the party. 
[02:26:00]  I just knew.  You knew, yeah.  I just knew.  I mean, it was on every TV, so I was still taking a look.  But you just felt the momentum completely changing.  And Peyton Manning, they had no answer for him.  That guy is probably going to be the greatest quarterback of all time.  Yeah.  Because if he was, if Colts didn't have Peyton Manning, they'd be a 5-11 team.  You saw how much they sucked when they played the second half of the Jet game when he took them out.  And then the Buffalo game, I think they almost got shut out or whatever it was when he's not in there.  That guy is that good.  Yeah.  Better than Richard Todd.  Seriously, he probably could. 
[02:26:30]  I'm not a big fan of Peyton Manning, but he probably will be the greatest quarterback of all time.  He should be a fan of the guy, though.  He's a nice guy.  I get those commercials that are fucking horrendous.  Oh, the fucking ping pong one with Justin Timberlake?  You know what?  They're not, that's on a scale of one to ten, they're like a negative three.  Funny.  The ones before that with the mustache, you put a little to the side.  He was trying to, I'm not Peyton Manning with the fucking phone, whatever it was.  They've gotten actually better, and they're still at a negative three.  We had him on the show once.  He called in.  Nice enough.  He was really nice.  Sure he is, and it's like, hey, he doesn't know. 
[02:27:00]  He's a football player.  Just read the script.  All right, fine.  Yeah, fuck it.  You know what I mean?  He's like, five million bucks, I'll fucking read it.  Yeah, I'll take it.  I'll be out of here in an hour, no problem.  So I understand where he's coming from, but they're just terrible.  And Justin Timberlake with the paddle.  Oh, it's hot.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I get it.  What the fuck is that, kid?  I get it.  Oh, so you just got a point off of it.  So your fucking paddle's really hot.  But Justin Timberlake is funny.  He's a comedian.  Oh, is he?  Yeah, he hosts SNL.  He's a funny guy, right?  Jesus.  Sanchez looked good, though. 
[02:27:30]  I was happy.  You know what?  The last few games with Sanchez, he's come into his own.  Pete Carroll, you know, coached him at USC.  He said he wasn't ready to come out because he only played 16 games in college.  Right.  And I really thought that.  And when you saw him play during the middle of the year, you're like, you know what?  A little rough.  He's a little rough, but he's real, absolutely.  For a rookie.  I was happy with his performance.  I really was.  No, he was great, man.  That fucking Rex Ryan, if he doesn't drop dead of a heart attack during the offseason.  Oh, and he ripped his fucking headphones off and started yelling because of that call.  All Jets fans are like, don't run.  What are you, crazy?  I was at a sports bar. 
[02:28:00]  I was in, like, where was I, Ohio or something like that, watching the game.  And every time he came on, they saw him screaming.  I was just yelling out, who stole my cake?  Who stole my...  The fucking place was rolling.  I never do that, but he was just...  Who stole my...  Where's my fucking cake?  That monster.  7,000 calories a day, he said he has.  Yeah.  He consumes.  Yeah, he doesn't fuck around.  7,000.  He's not trying to lose weight.  And who told him the sweater vest is a good look for him, though?  Oh, my God.  It's horrendous.  Yes, go with two...  Just wear a car.  Go with rock and roll shirts with the sleeves cut off. 
[02:28:30]  Yes, and fire on them.  It's horrendous.  And finally, who wins the Super Bowl there, Jim?  It's going to be a high-scoring game, right?  Yeah, I don't see the Colts not winning that game.  Really?  Yeah, I just...  They've been there before.  Manning is just a monster, man.  That guy, he'll make a mistake or two, but he's still going to bring you back.  I think, yeah, I think the Saints are going to be lucky.  You know, it'll be close.  It'll be like 34-24, Colts.  Official, right there.  I like that.  That's the official...  I don't know, you know, it's just tough. 
[02:29:00]  This deaf fucking guy's a monster, man.  He is.  You know, Breeze is good.  He's no slouch either, but, you know...  Well, their offense has been ridiculous this year.  Yeah.  I just think that, you know, New Orleans...  No one has a great defense anymore.  The whole league has changed.  It's all about passing.  Well, the Jets...  Well, you can't touch anybody anymore.  God forbid you fucking put a finger on somebody eight yards down the field to pass interference.  That should just be every play.  Just throw it fucking deep, and you're going to...  Half the time, you're going to get a pass interference.  It's a 40-yard gain.  It's true. 
[02:29:30]  It's a joke.  Basically, if you're on target, if you're a good passer, and the guy's going to be open,  you can catch it eight out of ten times.  You can't even go near the guy.  If you go near him, they fucking throw a flag.  They threw a flag in overtime.  You saw that one at the...  In overtime, I was like, come on, let these guys fucking play.  It was over his head.  It's like, you're not allowed to cover somebody?  Yeah, the pass wasn't catchable, I don't think, and they called it, and that set up the field goal,  and now the game's over.  Let the fucking guys play.  It's a sudden death in the playoffs.  Yeah, I mean, it's basically like a track meet. 
[02:30:00]  They're all indoors, fucking domes.  Whoever's the fastest could just run a good route.  You're fucking...  You're going to score a touchdown.  Yeah.  That's what it's like now.  Yeah.  I used to work with Marino on Inside the NFL, and he was saying, he goes, man, if I would  have played it today, he goes, I would have thrown fucking 80,000 yards, and I would  have had fucking 60 touchdown passes a year.  Really?  Yeah, because the old days, 20, 30 yards down the field, you could still fucking punch the  guy in the face as you're going up for the ball.  You could.  It's like, too bad.  They went for it, and nobody got it, or whatever. 
[02:30:30]  They used to just battle as they were running down the field.  Pushing, shoving, and elbowing.  What the fuck happened?  You're right.  It's a joke.  Yeah, Florentine's right.  Damn, man.  Absolutely right on that.  Should we take a break?  Somebody set up for Ozzy?  Yeah.  He doesn't look like he's here yet.  Is Ozzy coming?  You're so full of wee-wees from Ozzy.  Thumbs up for a break?  Or thumbs up for Ozzy.  Florentine, what are you promoting, man?  The Metal Show starting season four, Saturday, February 6th.  First guest?  Dave Mustaine from Megadeth.  Nice.  He has a lot to say.  Yeah, he was great. 
[02:31:00]  Very cool.  Yeah, and then this Saturday, January 30th, 8 p.m. at the Bolton Center, Bayshore, Long  Island.  Oh, Bayshore.  What's the Bolton Center?  Is that the old porn theater that Jimmy was at recently?  Yeah.  The old porn theater.  No, I'm serious.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Yeah, I was there.  It was creepy to see comedy in that place.  It was a porn theater?  Yeah, I went when I was 18.  It was the thing to do.  Of course.  Because we didn't have the fucking internet, so you get a bunch of your boys together,  believe it or not.  I know this sounds crazy.  You drink beer all the way down to Bayshore, and you check out porn.  That's what we used to do.  The best if kids don't understand what it was like. 
[02:31:30]  There's a porn theater in Jersey where a comedy club, they turn into a comedy club too, and  I remember going in there too.  I remember one time I went in there by myself.  I stopped home, driving home.  I stopped in there, and there was a guy sitting like, there was only four people in the theater.  Great.  This guy sitting like six, there's six people in the theater, so I take my own row.  Two minutes later, the guy sits in my row about three seats over.  I'm like, all right, this is fucking creepy, but I'm just going to keep watching.  I could see him in the corner of my eye, and then he has his arm out, and I'm looking.  I'm like, I'm not looking.  I'm not looking. 
[02:32:00]  He has his arm out, and then finally I look.  He has a $100 bill.  He's giving me a $100 bill.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And I just, I stormed out of there.  What'd you do with the $100?  Yeah, exactly.  Bought some mouthwash and had $96 profit.  I was making like $8 an hour at the time.  It's not Gabe, you're a struggling comic.  And Jimmy's in the bathroom.  Is Ozzy coming right now?  That's great.  For real?  I hope he can only stay for two minutes, and he leaves, and Jimmy misses him. 
[02:32:30]  It would be really bad.  We should make, not make, let's have Ozzy send Jimmy's seat.  I want to see how Jimmy handles that.  Really fucking Jimmy's in the bathroom and Ozzy's walking down the hall?  Yeah.  That's amazing.  That's classic.  What's Iraq waving him on for?  Like, there's a thousand other doors that are waving.  Oh, waving Steve.  Hello.  Yes.  It's Ozzy, of course.  Of course, Ozzy.  Take a seat.  Mr. Osborne. 
[02:33:00]  How you doing, sir?  Fine, thanks.  I like the wings.  Look at that.  That's nice shit you got there.  You got some nice bling.  Damn.  What's up, Ozzy?  That's got to cost two, three hundred dollars.  Christmas cracker.  Yeah?  Christmas cracker.  That's pretty good.  A little Jimmy Norton went to the bathroom.  He's your biggest fan.  Yeah, I know.  He's your biggest fan.  He went to take a piss.  He didn't think you were going to be, uh...  His bladder couldn't take you not, you know, knowing you were coming in.  So, uh, Jimmy's going to be very mad as he... 
[02:33:30]  Oh, here we go.  Here's Jimmy.  Yeah, here he is.  Here's a little Jimmy Norton.  You little bastard.  Can I tell you, you're in the house.  Look at you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ozzy looks good, man.  What the fuck?  You look really good today.  A bit early.  My face had time to drop, yes.  Is that what happens?  Hey, I was just thinking, what time do you guys get up in the morning?  5.15.  It's ridiculous.  5.  5.15.  I thought rock and roll was crazy.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah, we do the stay-up-all-night thing sometimes, though. 
[02:34:00]  You are?  You know?  Yeah, you stay up, like, all night, and then you do the show, and then go home and go to sleep.  You're doing the lines of white powder.  Nah, I used to.  I mean, we all did.  Back in the...  Yeah.  Back when everybody did.  That's what we used to call fun.  I was talking to a friend of mine a while ago.  I mean, I was getting that shit in your pure nostrils, you know?  Could you fuck on coke?  Yeah, that was fun.  Could you fuck when you were on coke?  No way.  I couldn't either.  My dick was horrendous.  No, let me tell you.  You usually get an acorn dick if you do coke, but if you're with, like, a new chick or really 
[02:34:30]  hot...  I've got an acorn dick without the fucking coke.  If you got hard, that wasn't going away.  Really?  If you got a hard-on on coke, you couldn't get rid of it.  No, no, I don't believe it.  I know guys used to eat fucking big meals.  I had some of the...  I'd throw more food away when doing that fucking...  Oh, yeah, you couldn't eat.  That's for sure.  Your appetite would go away.  Ozzy, was your ever...  You'd certainly have a drink of vodka.  Oh, you could drink. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, you'd drink.  And then you'd spend the rest of the night.  I don't know about you, because, you know, you know, rock guy, you could send somebody  out for more coke.  We had to sit there and go, where are we getting more coke?  Oh, I know.  It's fucking...  Especially at, like, the early hour of the morning when you run out and you're looking  on the carpet.  Picking up pretzel salt.  I think that's it.  There's a great story in the book about, back in the Sabbath days, when they're in the  house doing coke, and then the cops are knocking on the door.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, instead of flushing the fucking coke, they're like, we have to snort all of it. 
[02:35:30]  So, they're trying to snort the evidence.  Karen, we need it on those.  Ozzy, was there ever a time where you did coke, and then you had a groupie come back,  and you had the egg corn, and you couldn't...  Oh, I mean, that's the story of mine.  I love it.  You're a really nice chick.  I like you a lot.  Fucking...  The next morning when you wake up, you go, what the fuck are you doing with that thing?  And you couldn't fuck her, because what about the coke?  Did you have a little needle dick, or...?  Oh, a little needle dick?  I never had one to fucking start it. 
[02:36:00]  The coke's changed.  Second, I went, my dick got smaller, and my fucking boys got higher.  That's got to be embarrassing if you bring a girl backstage, you're doing coke, and then  she can't...  Listen, you bring them backstage for a trophy, but that's about it, man.  Yeah?  You don't...  Fucking hell.  I never used to...  I couldn't do shows with that stuff either.  Fucking...  Really?  Zap me a voice over...  Oh, to fuck your throat up?  Yeah.  Your book is phenomenal, man.  It's like...  I mean, I'm a recovering addict, so I kind of understand it on some level, but it's great 
[02:36:30]  to see what would have happened had I not stopped, and it's such a great...  Are you going to become a huge rock star?  Yeah, that's a bad example, actually.  Yeah, yeah.  That'd be a multi-millionaire success story instead of a fucking flop who lives at home  until I was 30.  I mean, you see, it's all...  I mean, as I said earlier on, I mean, can you believe that we used to thought that was  a good night?  That was a fun night, yeah, yeah.  Fucked up to your fucking...  Yeah.  Topped up to your fucking roofie amount.  And your whole night was dedicated to it.  Like, you didn't think of anything else. 
[02:37:00]  You know what we said in the hotel suites?  I ended up in the fucking bathroom all along.  Yeah.  Thinking you're doing sneaky, you know?  It was like, oh, everybody else is in the fucking bathroom, and you're doing the same  thing.  No, I don't have any left.  I'm just taking pisses every 10 seconds.  What happened where you knew, like, okay, this is not fun, and I don't appear to other  people the way I appear to myself, and I'm loaded?  When you've got no volume to bring you down, you've got no more booze to bring you in,  you've got no coke, and you still fucking daybreak, you go, this ain't such a...  God, please let me sleep, and I promise you I'll never do it again. 
[02:37:30]  Fucking...  When you've got to sleep, you wake up and do the first fucking line, you know?  It's great that Ozzy went through that same thing as all of us.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  When you go...  And I used to hate fucking daybreak.  Yeah.  I blacked the windows, and I fucking hated it.  I remember once being in Canada, doing all that shit.  And I'm walking back to the...  I don't know where we've been to this club all night.  Walking back to the...  As they go into work, and you're gacked up to the fucking guild, and you want to find 
[02:38:00]  the neatest rock to crawl under for another fucking week.  Yeah.  Oh, it's terrible, man.  You told a great story in the book about a revelation for you is when you were at...  I think it was Kelly's birthday party, and you thought you were like the life of the  party and the great dad.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  When I...  The thing about Betty Ford...  Sharon had found Betty Ford Center, and she said to me,  Darling, I found this place where they teach you to drink properly, and I go,  That's it.  I was drinking wrong.  Yeah.  So I'm expecting to go there and see Mrs. Ford, and go into a fucking bar with a smoking 
[02:38:30]  jacket on, and a little cocktail with an olive in, you know, a martini.  And she goes, Now, gentlemen, this is my fucking water, Betty fucking mind for you.  Yeah, yeah.  Stir the olive three times, and take a drink.  And I go, and I say, Mrs. Ford, where's the bar?  She went, What?  I mean, it didn't go down too well, but...  No, man.  But, um...  I mean, the things we would do to... 
[02:39:00]  And, you know, the festive fucking night out, you know, it's fucking bullshit, you know.  And the thousand, I love you.  You know, man, I really love you, man.  I've never said this to me before, but I really think you're a cool guy, man.  Were you a crier when you drank?  What?  Were you a crier?  Like, I would get drunk.  I'd depend on if I was drinking gin, yes.  Vodka, no. 
[02:39:30]  I even went to the show, I'd go, Oh, the fucking gin bottle.  Well, you said you saw a videotape of yourself.  Oh, yeah, man, she goes, You should have seen yourself yesterday.  And I go, Oh, I was thinking, What the fuck are you on about?  I was playing with the kids.  She said, Do you want to see yourself?  I said, What do you mean?  She put the fucking cassette in.  I did a fucking football tackle to the off switch.  I was like, Whoa!  You didn't want to see that? 
[02:40:00]  No, no.  Fucking thing.  The memory that I had of the day before wasn't what was on the fucking cassette.  It's a lie.  Hey, somebody else, not me.  It's all good, clean fun.  And then you look at the tape and you're an animal.  I haven't done that for a fucking cocaine I haven't done for a long, long time.  But I quit about doing smoking, dog, drinking, booze, all the rest of the shit. 
[02:40:30]  That's seven years.  Seven years.  It's been seven years.  Wow.  Did you used to drink or do coke before you were on state?  We always met.  I had so much in for the night before, I didn't need it.  So even the Sabbath and the solo days, never?  No, no.  Better occasionally, I would.  But not as a rule.  Oh, wait.  It was my...  Like, you give a horse a sugar lump.  But that was at the end of the gig.  I got my fucking coke.  Yeah, after you did it again.  You could do the fastest show in the world.  All right, let's go, brother. 
[02:41:00]  I'm going to poison myself.  It's just like, oh, this line of coke and a line of rat poison.  What's the difference?  That's true.  You never had to take a drink to take the edge off before you could go?  Occasionally, but not very often.  Did you ever get a driver's...  One of my favorite parts of the book is he's just talking about how fucking horrible a driver  is and you could never pass it...  Did you ever pass the driving test?  Yeah, I just recently got one in California.  Oh, you did?  But I must have had fucking 90 fucking attempts.  What was the problem? 
[02:41:30]  Alcohol and drugs.  I never had him in the fucking car.  The guy sitting next to me, the instructor, was like, what the fuck?  I'd pass out.  Yeah.  One time, I was just talking to Howard about it.  One time, I remember coming around.  And I went, where the fuck?  I look on the street beside me, and there's a handwritten note that says,  Mr. Osborne, you've filed your test, and I suggest you don't drive his vehicle any further. 
[02:42:00]  He just left.  Fucked up.  Unbelievable.  The fucking book is full of just really, really funny stories.  It's like, most biographies are boring.  Like, they have one interesting chapter, and then the chapter two always sucks.  This whole thing, I laughed out loud reading this entire book.  Yeah, Jimmy was reading it laughing, and then just taking, like, yellow post-it notes and going, like a lunatic.  He's going, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, just trying to talk about.  Slapping stickums on there.  And it was sad at times.  It was really a fucking great picture of your life, and it wasn't preachy. 
[02:42:30]  You know, I've had a charm in life when I think about it.  I mean, to be alive is a fucking gift.  No shit, man.  Now I go, I'm enjoying being me, you know.  I mean, when I first got successful with Black Sabbath,  you know, you could buy booze, you could buy your own.  You didn't have to scrounge butts off people.  You could buy your own.  And that was kind of like a working class attitude to life, you know, 
[02:43:00]  going out in the bar, you know.  But then that was me being able to say, you know, I've got success.  I can buy cigarettes, dope, booze, you know.  Get married at fucking 20 and have fucking three kids.  But then, you know, I'm much happier the way I am now than I used to.  And I said to you, how the fuck did we all think that was enjoying life?  Take a snort of death and sit in a fucking box all night. 
[02:43:30]  Do you regret it, though?  No.  You don't regret anything you've done like that?  We all have regrets, but as I said all along,  you can't, you know, the wreckage of my past still follows me, you know.  But I don't want to do that anyway.  If I don't like being straight, I know exactly what to do.  I was a professional not being straight.  Right, right, right. 
[02:44:00]  And I just, there's nothing attractive about it anymore.  He's like, give us a line, man.  Yeah.  I only have one.  Do you have any vice left that, like, you can't have taken away from you?  Whatever I like to do, I do addictively.  I work, I shop, I, you know.  Whatever I do, I can't do.  And the word moderation to me doesn't exist.  It doesn't exist.  Yeah, so you...  So whatever you're into, you've got to go full speed.  It's like the fucking, I've got to take it to the end, you know. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, of course.  And further.  So what have you replaced the drinking and drugs with in this point in your life?  I haven't replaced it, I've replaced it with reality, you know.  Yeah, something new, a new concept.  I mean, it was fun when it was fun, but when it got bad, it got very bad for me.  When I sit and look at them and go,  Oh, shit, yeah.  Five o'clock in the morning, gack to the fucking gills.  Um, I, I just didn't like the way I felt. 
[02:45:00]  If I did like the way I felt, I'd drink.  You'd get stoned again, but I, I just did not like the way I, I mean, when you can say  to yourself, is this a good fucking time, or am I just pretending it's a good time?  I got real, if you like.  Did it take any one instance that made you just say, fuck this?  No, I, the first thing I stopped was cigarettes.  Yeah?  And I've been in rehabs with a fucking bunch of them, with a bunch of hardcore smack users, 
[02:45:30]  and they go, you know, I could do the smack, but I can't put the cigarettes on.  I didn't know why, I mean, I'm a singer, and I just threw the fucking things away.  And then I, then I thought, well, if that, if that's easy, I just stopped the drink and  the drugs, you know.  So the heroin, heroin wasn't tough to get off?  Because I heard, that's supposedly the toughest one.  Well, I, well, I, I didn't use street heroin, heroin, I'd get doctors to shoot me with  Demerol, morphine, morphine, and Bicodens, and all the rest of the part.  Ah, some of the perks of being a rock star. 
[02:46:00]  Don't have to go out on the street.  But you used to pull a lot of pranks, too, like, when you get high and stuff, like, you  know.  Yeah, it's part of the gig, isn't it?  And fucking, when some poor wretch is fucking, out of his mind, passed out, and like,  that was dangerous for you, Rami.  You went to fucking sleep before me, and I was fucked up.  Right.  Wake up, baby, you've got no eyebrows, no fucking hair.  Faint, faint.  It's a crap weekday now.  I'll tell you what we should do.  I love it.  You shave somebody's eyebrows off.  Yeah.  Because your eyebrows, they're expression.  Yeah.  You look in the mirror, and they go, oh, fucking hell. 
[02:46:30]  I've got no eyebrows, I've got no expression.  Yeah.  I must be really ill.  I can't look happy or sad.  I had a guy, remember when I just wore them chain mail suits, and fucking that guy, and  died at the moment.  The chain suits, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was a guy, come on, it's my house, and he got, oh, we got this guy, fucking blitz  green, and I threw his clothes on the fucking fire, and he had to go home, with his fucking  red shirt, red, all these performance clothing. 
[02:47:00]  He has a weird wife and fucking no shit.  Let's get back to the book, because Jimmy wrote down a whole bunch of stuff that you  read in the book that you want to ask Ozzy about, right?  Or a couple of things, maybe?  One thing, there was a couple of things that were amazing to me.  One was, you got an AIDS test.  Yeah.  Oh, man, that was fucking bad, because we were doing so many drugs.  Back then, the HIV test was in these primitive days, you know, so it came back as a borderline, 
[02:47:30]  which I read as a positive, and I was like, you fucking what?  And I was like, freak the fuck out, and then I was like, wait another week for the fucking  next one, and we should, negative, and I was like, was the first one real, and the  second one not real?  It told me a new fucking asshole that did.  You said that stopped you from cheating, too, after that.  Really?  Yeah?  To a point.  To a point, yeah, we all know.  You're almost obligated if it's overseas. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah, that was like when Magic Johnson came out and said he had HIV.  Every guy's like, I'm never doing that again.  A week later, we're in a strip club, so we're like, ah, whatever.  I'm sure he was gay, or whatever.  Use a bag for like one time.  Exactly, yeah.  Start justifying it.  Half the time, use a bag, slide it off with a thumb.  There you go.  No, it's still on, as far as I think.  What about the shit story?  Dude, fucking Ozzy, you've got to ask her about the shit story.  Shit your pants stories in fucking head.  There's no one with better shit stories than fucking Ozzy. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  There's one, supposedly, like in the hotels back in the day, like the ice machines were  really low to the ground, and they said like, you know, when you get back to the hotel,  you would shit in the ice machines.  And then when people left their shoes outside the hotel door to get them shined, the Ozzy  would shit in the shoes, and he wouldn't even just go to bed, he would wait up to hear  the person come out and put his foot in it, go, what the fuck?  So he'd be up all night by his door just waiting. 
[02:49:00]  What the shit accomplished?  Yeah.  He'd be going to bed.  Holy shit, that's funny.  Whose curtains did you use to wipe your ass?  Roger Whittaker.  Sharon was looking for a house, and the day before, I'd taken his fucking coal and tending,  which was like fucking dynamite.  And I forgot, and I got this Roger Whittaker.  You know who Roger Whittaker is?  No, who is he?  Roger Whittaker is like a folk singer kind of guy.  He just whistles a lot.  And what interested me about his house, he had a recording studio, I thought, oh, great, 
[02:49:30]  man.  So anyway, and when I got to there, I was just like, oh, no.  But his house was sold, he never put fucking toilet paper in his john.  Oh, so it's his father.  Can I just say it really, really, really, too personally?  Can I use his toilet?  Sure.  I'll go, and I'll fucking unload.  And I'll go, oh, no, I've got no toilet paper.  So sit on my toes and wipe my ass for these curtains. 
[02:50:00]  Holy shit.  Now did you tell Sharon afterwards that you did?  Oh, yeah, Sharon, you fucking what?  And he threw him in the bathtub behind the shower curtain where no one would notice.  Couldn't even get rid of the evidence, right?  With his hair, man.  God damn it.  Oh, Sam?  Yeah, Sam.  You're not hallucinating.  You don't want a fucking mountain bike or something.  We're not sure about Sam and his hair.  Fuck, you ain't a little.  It's very kinky.  Turn sideways.  Turn sideways, yeah.  Just fucking hell, man.  That's some hairdo.  Yeah, it's like a bird's nest or something. 
[02:50:30]  You're not married, yeah?  No.  We're trying to figure out if he's black, Ozzy.  We're not really sure about him.  Yeah, it's something.  Because he does that.  He's related to Thomas Jefferson, for real.  And you know what Thomas is.  The Thomas is.  Every other American.  Yeah.  Thomas Jefferson used to get in the back there and, you know, take a few out, so.  Yeah, I don't know.  What's the burglar story?  Because I tried telling them that before and I didn't know exactly what happened.  It was like you were taking a piss and you came into the room and there was a burglar 
[02:51:00]  in your house.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  It was four o'clock in the morning.  I got to sleep.  I sleepwalk a lot, you know.  I fucking walk.  And I'm stark naked.  And I go into my wife's bedroom.  I don't know why I was in the other side of the house.  And there's this guy.  Stupid.  I'm thinking, I'm not fucking dreaming.  So this guy makes a run for the window and I got him in the head.  Like, I'm stark fucking naked.  He's got a scream act on.  I go, oh, this is going to end up bad.  I'm fucking, I know he isn't. 
[02:51:30]  And he's looking at me.  His eyes are shrinking.  I go, I went, I could kill this fucking guy now.  I could do all these different thoughts into mine.  I thought, why do you got a brother or a fucking gang or how can I sleep?  They come back and beat me to death and my sleep.  You thought I'm all this doing a struggle?  In England, you can't shoot them and you can't kill them.  No, no.  Even in your house?  Yeah.  No, you can't even have a gun over there.  It's crazy.  Well, didn't you used to own, that's one of the things I was really surprised to learn  was that you actually at one point owned a lot of guns.  I still do.  Oh, you still do.  Okay.  My son owns even more. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Anthony has a lot of guns.  I just bought a sniper over.  What, a Barrett?  One of those Barrett 50 cal.  Jack Tom, you know.  Big fucking.  It's like one of them 50 cal fucking things.  Yeah, yeah.  Accurate for three miles.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, where do you shoot that?  I would love to buy one, but I don't even have a range to go shoot that at.  You could kill people in Afghanistan.  Yeah, from here.  Oh, that's cool.  I didn't know, because I've been in guns for forever. 
[02:52:30]  It's a sign of bad guns.  It's attractive.  I mean, in California, you can buy a gun like that, but you can't fucking get a driving license.  You can go out of your phone and say, I want to buy that fucking .357, dude.  Sign out.  It's yours.  You can be stoned out of your fucking face and buy a gun.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  New York, it's a little rough.  The thing about it is, the cops have them also.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, you got a lot.  Do you ever remember that shootout in Hollywood? 
[02:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  When the cops had to go to the gun stores to get.  Yeah.  They had just had a body armor on, and they're shooting like crazy.  The cops are shooting their 9mm, and they weren't doing anything.  The cops had to go to the gun stores around the town and get assault rifles from the gun stores to fight these guys.  Really?  The bank robbers, yeah.  And they finally took them out.  That's an amazing story.  That's a big one.  Have you and, what's, you and Sabbath have a, is like you and Tony and the guys have a bad relationship now, or is it okay?  It's on and off.  Some days we're talking, some days we ain't. 
[02:53:30]  But that's life, you know?  I love the guys.  I don't have any, but I'm not going to start slagging them.  Without them, I wouldn't be there.  Without me, they wouldn't be there, you know?  We, we, we, we, one thing I really like about the Sabbath, though, is the fact that we weren't some, some big moguls success story.  You know, we didn't know it.  We, we, we knew each other.  We went to, I went to school.  We were the same school as Tony.  We, we were like a little bunch of local guys that had a good idea, and it worked, you know?  But what would you say your favorite Sabbath album is, if you had a pick? 
[02:54:00]  I don't, I don't have a favorite.  It's certainly not heaven and hell.  You know what I'm talking about?  Poor old Ronnie Deals, he's sick, he's got cancer on him.  Yeah, he's got cancer, I heard about that.  That's a drag, man.  Yeah, that sucks.  I mean, everybody thinks, oh, Roz, he's a dronny.  I don't know anything about it.  He's a good singer.  No, we've interviewed him.  He loves you.  He's, he had nothing but good things to say.  Yeah, he's, well, he's doing really well.  He's almost, you know.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's a digital cut. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, he's doing, he's doing really well.  The prognosis is really good, so.  But you guys, you guys had a big feud back in the day with the Sabbath, and they've, you  know, you guys go back and forth in the press.  It was almost like wrestling, like pro wrestling, you guys.  It's, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, I'm going to give this thing to a guy called  Ronnie, a little fucking bastard.  But there was never really, I only ever, I mean, I've never really met him.  I've only met him a few times. 
[02:55:00]  But, you know, good for him.  He's, I don't care.  You know, I'm doing all okay.  And you had the little Ronnie midget come out during the Derby Madman tour, bring you  water and stuff.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, you had a little midget come out, Ronnie.  You can't give it to you, seriously.  Really?  Did he really?  Jesus.  A little midget guy killed himself.  Wow, really?  God damn.  Jesus.  What the hell did you do to him?  No, he, he, he, he was, he was, he was a big, that old, drunkenly little guy.  He's fucking loved to get fucking wasted on the boot. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Probably doesn't take much.  You know, shorts.  Yeah.  It's kind of hard, like as a midget, it's kind of hard to forget your plight.  Like, you know, whatever's wrong with you, you try to forget,  and not think about it.  But, you know, as a midget, there's no way you can.  The minute you hop off the couch.  I used to go, uh, where's the toilet?  And I'd go to, follow me, and there'd be, like, woman on the door,  but the Mahando, the W-I-I.  That's how he couldn't see it.  Oh, you're men.  You go in here.  He's got a million of them.  Jesus, man, you've got some pranks. 
[02:56:00]  Something else I learned from the book, too, is that I didn't know I only quit Sabbath just  as you guys were getting started and joined Jethro Tull.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Well, I mean, it was, it was a, we were doing so, he's a great player, Tony.  He's a fucking, there ain't nobody who comes up with heavy riffs like him.  He's fucking great.  And he quit and joined Jethro Tull, and Iommi is actually in that, uh, that famous Rolling  Stones circus.  Rock and Roll.  Rock and Roll.  He's actually in that with Jethro Tull, and then he just got bored with those guys four  days later and came back to you. 
[02:56:30]  I was like, what?  I mean, that was, I don't think he liked the way, I mean, Tony's a leader, not a follower,  you know.  He's never been one to, you know, take, I mean, apparently they were telling him what  to wear, how to do it, and whatever.  But one thing, he got, he came back and he says, if we want to do anything, we've got  to get really fucking serious about it, you know.  Yeah.  It's all fucking, it was a great, great, every band that I've been with, like, from the 
[02:57:00]  beginning days, it's always the best one.  Yeah.  You've got nothing to lose, you know, when I did the Blizzard and Diary albums, that  was fun, you know.  Right, right, right, like at the beginning, building it up.  It's great.  All together like that, yeah, yeah.  You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Right, right, exactly.  When you get up there, you've got to come and beat your last record.  No, you've got to try to stay where you are, and that's a tough one.  A lot of people will notice, though, with the Blizzard of Oz and the Diary from Mad Men,  those albums, they recorded them at the same time.  Because you guys wanted to go out on the road for like two to three years. 
[02:57:30]  So imagine if they would have put that as a double album.  That probably would have been the greatest double album of all time.  Double album, but it's just, um, we only had to do eight songs back then.  Yeah, I know.  I didn't do fucking songs on a single.  Double albums.  God damn it.  But I mean, not many successful double albums, though.  Right, there is a problem.  I mean, Physical Graffiti or something like that.  Sure, France, it comes alive.  Yeah, there's a few, I know.  They recorded those two at the same time, which was amazing.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, and then, you know, went on tour for about a year and a half, 
[02:58:00]  and then put Diary from Mad Men out, and it was already done.  Nowadays, that would have just been out online the next day anyway,  and you couldn't stash an album away for a year.  I mean, if you'd have said to me 20 years ago,  this is what it's going to be like in the future,  I would have got you fucking stoned.  Really?  Yeah, because how would you...  You can say, oh, on that record of that album,  on that record of that album, make it on compilations.  Yeah, you can mix and make your own compilations out.  What do you think of that whole thing, aside from buying it?  It's kind of sad in a way, but it's progress. 
[02:58:30]  I think it's going to be...  Someone's going to have to come up with a new idea soon,  because it's not cost-effective to make records anyway.  I mean, everybody does fucking 300-year tours now, you know?  Yeah, yeah, and they're just piecemealing together what they want to hear,  so if you put an album out, you're good for what?  A song, maybe two, if you're lucky, on the album.  Yeah, I'm just completing my new album.  I haven't got a title for it yet, but I'm just nearly done that.  Do you find that it might help cut out the record companies, though,  who have a lot of times fucked the artists, 
[02:59:00]  so it's like if the artists can...  I know that's groundbreaking information,  but if the artists can kind of just put it out on iTunes or something like that,  you guys can, in a lot of ways, not get fucked by the record companies.  Yeah, but you know what?  Well, it's not so much me and people in my generation,  but the new kids, now the record companies apparently weren't part of the gig money,  part of the...  Oh, everything.  Yeah, concessions, yeah.  Yeah, it's fucking...  That's rough.  What are you...  It's tough to make it.  Because Sabbath was amazing.  You guys wouldn't get record play,  and then you came over from England, 
[02:59:30]  and by the time you got, I think, from, what, New York to California,  everybody knew who you were.  It was like, what was it that spread that so fast?  There was no internet.  Word of mouth.  Word of mouth.  I mean, I don't know what's up now,  because everybody's got a fucking cell phone, you know?  I mean, I often wonder,  who's going to be the next thing to...  Who's going to last out of all this?  Like, I mean, I don't know.  Is it Justin Timberlake?  I don't know.  Oh, you mean like newer artists?  Like, who's going to be the next...  Who's going to be the next fucking rock star? 
[03:00:00]  Big, that has longevity.  It seems to be tough to get longevity now in the music business.  Because there's so many one-hit wonders,  because like I was saying,  it's just so easy to pick one song that you want.  You get like these boy bands now.  They're the biggest things in sliced bread.  Then you go, what happened to them guys, you know?  Yeah, they're gone.  And then, yeah, a lot of the bands,  I just find very generic these days.  There's nothing special about it.  It's all contrived.  A lot of it seems...  I don't know what it is.  It's all down to America and all that now. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, put it on.  It's not the new thing.  I often wonder when people are going to get fed up with the next thing,  because everything's run by that TV stuff now, you know?  How did you survive all the fads, though?  You went through from Sabbath into...  You survived the hair...  You know what, when you're in something like Sabbath,  it's kind of weird because you think,  how the fuck are we going to get past this Peter Frampton thing?  How are you going to get past this new Bon Jovi thing?  And it's like... 
[03:01:00]  And suddenly you just plod in.  It's like the hair and the fucking tortoise, you know?  We just plod along and all these things come bolting past us.  And then, you know, they just pizzle out, you know?  And you just carry on.  I don't know what the answer is, really.  I know you're in music because of McCartney.  There's really a cool...  When you talk...  I related to something you said about...  Because I'm obviously a huge fan of you and a few other artists,  and I'm a blithering idiot when I meet people I like.  I'm never comfortable talking to them. 
[03:01:30]  I think you figured that out.  Sometimes I'm disappointed.  If I like somebody from a distance and I go...  I imagine what he's going to be like,  but sometimes I'm very mistaken and I go...  Very disappointed, right?  Fucking asshole.  McCartney, McCartney, when I met him, he was great.  Elton John's a great guy.  Who was an asshole?  Sorry?  Who was an asshole?  I knew somebody was going to say that.  Come on.  I mean, you set it up.  We need to know.  I don't want to reveal my asshole.  How about...  Give us a clue.  What?  Give us a clue.  No. 
[03:02:00]  I know who Lazi probably got creeped out about,  and Jim always tells a story.  When me and Jim met him at MTV years ago,  we were just staring at you,  and you're looking at us like,  who are these fucking creeps?  And we didn't know if we should approach you,  and then finally we do,  and you just gave us the autographs,  and like, all right, just get out of here.  And then we followed you into the bathroom  because we were such big fans.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to be a guy.  Wrong person to follow me in the bathroom.  You do piss a lot, right?  You piss constantly.  Oh, we saw him fucking...  No, I didn't get to see.  You didn't see his hog? 
[03:02:30]  No, it wasn't a gay thing.  It was just out of respect.  Sometimes you check someone's penis out of respect.  It's not a fucking homosexual thing.  You checked out Ozzy's penis?  I don't fucking check other guy's penis.  Thank you, Ozzy.  No, I didn't actually...  I know a good few people  that like to check your penis.  You don't have me...  Give me fucking cell phone pictures  of my dick I've sent out.  It's embarrassing.  That's why I have a cell phone  to send people shots in my dick.  What did you say to McCartney  when you met him?  I don't know.  That's a slight-ass... 
[03:03:00]  No, no, no, no, no...  You know, you know,  I heard that I was a big fan.  I mean, he's...  That guy's written...  Somebody just brought me up  for Christmas...  This Christmas...  He's a gig at the new football stadium thing.  He's just like...  He's a fucking guy  who's 60-something.  He did like a four-hour fucking shot  and every song where you go...  Fucking hell, yeah.  And oh, wow.  He's got such a great body of work, that guy.  Yeah.  And he still...  Whatever you say about the guy,  he's written some of the 
[03:03:30]  fucking phenomenal songs of all time.  And he sounds good live, too.  He did this a few years ago.  I've seen him a few times live.  And he's just fucking great live.  Do you get a kick out of the fact  that your idols know who you are?  Like, is that cool for you  when you meet somebody  who you've always loved?  I mean, the Beatles  were the ones that lit my fucking light,  you know.  And they just got sent...  I wanted to become a Beatles  and a former car  and running up with my sister  or John Lennon 
[03:04:00]  marrying my dad.  Was that a big thing  to get your ass over to the States?  Oh, yeah.  Back then...  And was it because of the Beatles  that kind of influenced them?  America was like the fucking place  to crack, you know.  Because had you played all over Europe  or were you just...  Oh, yeah.  Okay, so...  And how did that go?  Like, were you accepted  and, wow, these guys fucking rock?  Or...  We first came to America  with our own PA system, 
[03:04:30]  which in England  we got 400 fucking cabinets, you know.  We still...  Half of it ended up in one state.  We lost a lot of it.  Really?  And then...  It was just...  It was just the experience  of being in this country.  It was fucking great.  I mean, to land in...  I remember when we landed  in Kennedy Airport  and it was like a warm summer evening  and it was like...  It was just something about it  which was so attractive to us.  Yeah, I bet.  When it wasn't...  You didn't have any reservations?  Like, holy shit,  how the hell are we gonna... 
[03:05:00]  No, it was...  I mean, for the first...  When I first came to New York  I wouldn't go to the hotel  for a fucking month.  Yeah.  I was fucking...  You dirty rat.  That's all we got.  That's all we got in England.  We got the movies.  Yeah, that's what New York was.  Because a bunch of...  The fucking...  Dangsters.  Old jangsters.  Hey, take them off.  Take them off.  Fucking Roy Ryder's  galloping down people.  And then when did you...  When did you finally realize like, 
[03:05:30]  wow, I think we're on to something  here in the States?  About 1993.  Fucking Aussie.  He rules.  Fucking Aussie.  I'm amazed too  that OzFest came  because fucking stupid Lollapalooza  Sharon had called  to get you on Lollapalooza  and those fucking dummies  didn't understand  how popular you still were  and...  They said,  oh, we can't get a point.  I mean, I got fucking...  What's that guy's name?  Perry Farrell.  No, on the show...  Oh, fucking early in the morning. 
[03:06:00]  You've got those standard singers  and they go,  Ozzy's like a fucking dinosaur now.  I'm going,  oh, I'm a dinosaur.  What about this fucking fat ass  fucking singer man?  Right.  What's his name?  He's like Sinatra.  What's his...  Oh, Christ.  Oh, it's Tony Bennett.  Tony Bennett.  Oh, Tony Bennett.  Tony Bennett was on Lollapalooza.  And he's a nice guy,  you know, but fucking...  But no kid.  That's for sure.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm not a fan of his music either.  I don't...  My heart and sample  with a smile on your face. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, so Shannon said,  fuck them,  we'll do that.  I said, whoa,  slow down a bit, mama.  I said, don't do...  If you're going to do that,  don't do too many shows.  Because if it didn't work out,  we're going to look fucking great.  We're like fucking 500 shows,  you know,  but nobody in there.  So it started off  like four, five,  six,  so much to us,  venues.  And it grew from there.  And you guys are going to do it  this year again?  Oh, absolutely.  That's amazing  because you guys,  you know,  took a couple years off  and stuff.  That's for a year off. 
[03:07:00]  A year off,  I wrote a book  and did a fucking album,  so that's my year off.  Yeah,  they've got a solo album  coming out  and some year off.  We've got to wrap up,  unfortunately,  with music and stuff.  Yeah,  we've got another minute or two.  A lot of people say  Sharon kind of pushes you  into working  when you want to relax.  Well,  I mean,  I'm a lazy ass,  you know.  I had the idea  of being a rock star  was living like a bohemian  and fucking  eating grapes  and being fed. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah,  but I mean,  she loves fucking driving.  She just did that fucking  celebrity apprentice  and she got so sick  with his fucking  Persian flu  or whatever the fuck  is going on now.  Really?  And I said,  what the fuck  are you doing?  She'd get up at five  in the morning  and work all day  till eleven,  you know,  and I said,  Sharon,  is he fucking working?  I said,  okay,  I'll impersonate  Donald Trump.  You're fired. 
[03:08:00]  You know,  it's such a show.  You know,  Sharon and all the contestants  have to raise money  for the charity  and whoever gets  the most money  has all the other  people's money  to go into there.  So that's fucked.  Oh,  so the other charities  get fucked out of money?  No.  So us guys  are on the show  and our job is  to get money  for whatever charity  we're representing there.  Whoever out of us  gets the most money,  we all have to give him  our money. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah,  so only one charity  gets the money?  Pardon?  Only one charity  gets the money?  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Okay.  That's fucked.  Yeah,  that's not,  that's not cool  for the other charities,  right?  Sharon was fucking  working,  right?  Someone might think.  Yeah,  you don't like  Donald Trump,  huh?  Oh,  I know,  he's a nice guy.  He's a nice guy.  I think that's  a fucking bit  of a wacky rule.  We were just  trying to trip you up.  But whatever  they say about  Sharon,  I mean,  Ozzy always admits  this that if it  wasn't for Sharon,  he would have  never had a solo career. 
[03:09:00]  He basically  would have just  petered out  and nothing.  She saved him.  You were laying  on the couch  for six months  after you left  Sabbath just drinking  and she got  your ass in gear  and got you banned  and got you  back out on the road.  So if it wasn't  for her,  no Oz.  But how is this  any different  than a husband  and wife?  Like,  it's so fucked up  where it's like,  oh boy,  Sharon pushes him.  Sharon,  you ever been  fucking married?  Your wife is  up your ass  the whole fucking time?  They weren't married  at the time.  They weren't even  together.  Oh,  I was married.  She was.  Someone had 
[03:09:30]  dropped off an envelope  with 500 bucks  and they're like,  could you give this  to Sharon?  So it's like,  yeah.  This guy dropped  his empty envelope  for you.  It's written out  500 dollars.  What the fuck  kind of a guy  would do that?  There's a lot  of great fucking  Sharon really  screaming at him  stories in the book  too.  No shit,  I bet.  The thing is,  you've always been  really honest about  yourself and your flaws.  It's like,  you don't try to put up  a rock star persona.  It's like,  you talk about  being afraid. 
[03:10:00]  It's too much  like hard work  for me to come  and be the fucking  dick of the party.  Oh,  it's like,  I'm glad that  people know  I'm there now  rather than  didn't want me  there.  Right,  right.  You know,  I don't,  I mean,  I don't,  it's the way I am.  I don't want to be  like this fucking  ego prick.  I think,  you know,  it's hard work  to see these guys  who've got this,  I don't remember  that fucking  Daryl Hall  and fucking  Oats guy. 
[03:10:30]  He was like,  looking down  his fucking eyes  and I go,  oh,  for fuck's sake.  Been there,  done it,  got over it.  Do you get scared  before you go on stage?  Every night.  Every time.  Still,  that's,  that's something  that I think  amazes everybody.  Okay,  I mean,  I mean,  singers only got  one instrument  which,  and they can't  change their voice.  Yeah.  Guitar player can change  and the drummer  can change his drum.  Do you know  if you're,  you know,  like as a comic,  I know a couple  minutes into it  if it's going  to be a bad night.  Can you feel that  sometimes when you're  up there like, 
[03:11:00]  oh,  this is going to be  a rough one?  Oh, yay,  when my voice goes,  oh,  thank you,  God,  you fucking asshole.  I know there was,  there was some,  not that I would  ever compare myself  to the great  Ozzy Ozoran,  but there were  many nights,  because I would  sing with bands  when I was growing up,  where you would think,  oh,  I am fucked tonight.  I can't even talk,  nonetheless.  I know.  And then you get up,  one of the best nights  you could sing.  And then sometimes  you think you're  going to have a great night  and you can't hit  a fucking note.  I did a show 
[03:11:30]  in Canada,  Vancouver,  and I'm fine,  I'm absolutely  fucking fine.  Warm up my voice,  go on,  and I go,  good day.  I'm going to be  me up,  Scotty,  you fuck pig,  get me out of the air.  That's when you look  at the set list  and go,  shit,  that's a lot of slides.  Oh,  you got a fucking  hangover  from the night before,  and you,  I remember going to  Biloxi Mixers,  every, 
[03:12:00]  we had two days off,  I got off the bus,  straight in the fucking bar,  there for two days,  I did a show  on the third day,  I'm on there going,  paranoid's my end,  end of the night,  and I go,  fucking God,  get me to paranoid,  just kill me now,  I mean the sound  of a fucking bee  flying past me  was louder  than the fucking bar,  and I'm on this fucking,  get me to paranoid,  God,  for fuck's sake,  you look great,  you look great,  drop that song,  drop that song, 
[03:12:30]  do I,  hello,  goodnight,  finish with my woman,  how great is it  when you know  you're rolling  into the final song  of the night  and you're made,  is it the best feeling?  when you,  especially when you,  and that's one of the things  I'm glad I don't have to do anyway,  I just,  I don't know,  I don't have to pretend  I'm on the phone  when I'm not,  you know.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  You're up there  having a good time,  man.  Most of the time.  We've got to get out of here.  Yeah,  they're panicky pizza up there,  they've got to get you going.  He's got other interviews to do.  Ozzy,  thank you so much.  Whoa,  whoa, 
[03:13:00]  whoa,  Jimmy,  Jimmy wants something from Ozzy,  don't you,  Jimmy?  You were going to ask him  for something.  Want a kiss?  No!  You're not going to look at my dick.  No,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no.  It's got two Viagra  strapped in.  Ozzy,  have you ever used Viagra  or Cialis?  Oh,  yeah.  It's great,  isn't it?  Yeah,  but when you do the coke,  you get a boner,  but you can't have a shuddering leg  at the end of it.  No,  Ozzy,  we were joking that  Jimmy's your biggest fan ever,  and we're like,  Jimmy,  you're going to probably ask Ozzy 
[03:13:30]  to give you something  like a ring  or the necklace.  You can fuck off.  You know,  it's funny,  I met Ozzy back in like 1981.  You were doing the  Blizzard of Oz tour.  You were doing a record store  appearance in New York,  and I had like an $8 watch,  and I'm like,  Ozzy,  I'm a big fan.  He's like,  thanks.  He signs all my stuff.  I go,  here,  you can have my watch.  He's like,  what do I want your watch for?  And I'm like,  no,  I'm a big fan.  He's like,  thanks,  but I don't want your watch.  I'm like,  please take it.  He goes,  I don't want your fucking watch.  Get out of here.  What a fucking psychopath.  I know,  it was an $8 watch.  Why am I giving it to him? 
[03:14:00]  He's like,  I want it.  We promoted a signing tonight,  too.  I think it says,  Ozzy will be signing at Borders  at Columbus Circle tonight  in Manhattan,  which is in the Time Warner building.  And it's an amazing building  because there's so much room  to stand inside,  so even if it's cold,  you'll be inside waiting.  And the book,  I'm not just talking as if,  it's fucking phenomenal.  It's really funny,  and it's really honest,  and it's just an amazing rock biography.  There's no other ones I've read  that are compared to it.  It's out today, right?  Yeah, it is out today.  I am Ozzy.  I am Ozzy,  and if you can't get to see Ozzy, 
[03:14:30]  get it on Amazon.  Yeah,  fuck you.  Exactly.  It's going to do great.  You can't fucking read something else.  Hey, Ozzy,  this was great, man.  This was a lot of fun, man.  A lot of fun for everybody,  and we appreciate it.  We're going to take a quick break.  Ozzy Osbourne, everybody.  Fucking Ozzy, man.  We were talking about the interview,  and we've had Ozzy on many,  many times over the years.  I've lost track.  A lot of phoners,  three or four studio visits. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  That was the best Ozzy interview  we've ever done.  I think kicked ass.  He was really on,  really sharp,  funny as all hell.  Right?  Yeah.  61 years old.  61 years old.  Up all morning doing interviews.  Fucking sharp at the comedy.  My God.  He was on it.  On fire,  like he had these lines rehearsed.  Yeah.  He's fucking hysterical.  It's like,  Jimmy just goes,  yeah,  so if you can't get down there  to see Ozzy,  fuck you.  Yeah.  You know what's going to be, 
[03:15:30]  Ozzy left his Starbucks cup here  that he was drinking out of.  You think Jim wants this?  You want it, right?  You're just as bad as Jim.  Quarantine in studio.  You know,  I gave Jim a poster  with Ozzy,  Randy,  Rhodes,  and Rudy Sarzo signed.  Signed Randy.  I gave that up,  so I think I should get the Starbucks.  I didn't realize that.  But it is Jim's show,  so if he wants it.  I didn't realize you're an Uber fan  like fucking Norton.  You're right there.  You're right behind him.  I.  You're showing me an old fucking  Black Sabbath video  that's on your phone.  On my iPhone.  Yeah,  absolutely.  Because Jimmy,  Jimmy, 
[03:16:00]  Jim Florentine was telling me  that there was a time  where Ozzy,  like,  sang from,  like the side of the stage.  Well,  not the side,  but he wasn't front and center.  He was more off to the left side  if you're looking at the stage.  Tony Elmi took the center stage  where the singer sings  because he said,  it's my band.  I don't care.  You know,  I write all the stuff.  Wow.  Around 75,  76,  and he would stand,  so Ozzy was on the side  where the guitar player is.  It's the weirdest thing.  And he had the big spotlight  on Tony the whole time,  and,  you know,  I guess when Ozzy would sing,  but pretty much it was just on, 
[03:16:30]  and I only would stand  front row center  and just play his guitar  with his head up.  That looks a little awkward.  It did.  Yeah.  You guys see the video.  I got video of it  from Don Kirshner's rock concert.  It makes you feel a little uncomfortable  because it's Don Kirshner's rock concert.  Yeah.  He's supposed to be,  you know,  front and center.  Is Tony just an egomaniac?  He was at the time  because there was...  He's not anymore?  He's been humbled over the years?  I don't,  you know,  I don't know.  There's still some stuff going on  with them,  underlying issues,  but Tony pretty much  took over the band  after like 75  because everyone was so much  into drugs.  So Tony too,  but Tony pretty much wrote,  like the Techno Lestasy album 
[03:17:00]  was 1976,  wrote that whole album,  produced it,  didn't let anyone  in the whole band  do anything on it.  Is it a good album?  I don't know.  I guess it's not their best.  It's probably,  it comes to the hit off it  for us,  you know.  There was no hit.  Rock and roll doctor.  Look at Ozzy.  Holy shit.  That is an old fucking video.  Jimmy just came back in,  yeah,  Ozzy singing from  kind of wow.  Is that Don Kirshner's rock concert?  Yeah.  And now Black Sabbath  on Don Kirshner's rock concert  with Ozzy Ogsbourne. 
[03:17:30]  Did this kill you?  Snowblind.  Snowblind.  That fucking voice, man.  How was he just in here?  This is so old.  I know,  this is 1975.  How was he just in here?  That's 35 years ago.  Sabotage just came out.  We're looking at something  that's 35 years ago.  Dude,  Nixon with president.  And Ozzy was right sitting  where Florentine is,  just sharp as ever.  Was it everything  you thought it would be,  Jimmy?  This Ozzy thing?  He's great, man.  Yeah,  of course.  It was just great.  And if you're going to grab 
[03:18:00]  that Starbucks cup,  you've got to do it now  because Florentine is  fucking eyeing it.  That's the one  he was drinking at him.  He's going to clone  his own Ozzy.  Yeah,  what am I going to do?  Would you take that home?  Nah.  Jerk off in it?  He's still here.  You can have him autograph it.  I would not.  I got him to sign my picture  of Ozzy.  Why don't you clone him, man?  There might be a little DNA  around the fucking books.  Yeah,  that would be cool.  I asked for another picture  outside.  I wasn't going to,  but I was talking to  Tony Dennis,  his assistant,  who's a fucking great guy.  And Ozzy just walked up  and clapped me on the back.  Yeah.  I was at the urinal 
[03:18:30]  and all of a sudden  I smell Ozzy  before I knew  he was peeing next to me.  I'm like,  He smells great, right?  And I'm like,  do I do it?  Do I,  A,  look,  or B,  strike up a conversation  with Ozzy?  I'm like,  you know what?  No.  So you didn't look either?  I didn't look  or talk to him.  Oh, how awkward.  You should have just said something.  We're both staring straight ahead  peeing.  I'm like,  what kind of small talk  am I going to have  with Ozzy?  With our dicks in our hands.  Good job, Ozzy.  Right.  A lot of fun.  Just something awful  on the show. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, but you know,  I mean,  being,  you know,  in this business and stuff,  like if you hung out  with a fan  at one of the appearances  or whatever  and you spend time with them  and then you go in the bathroom  and the guy next to you  in the stall  and still wants to talk,  you're like,  all right,  dude,  come on,  I gave me enough time.  Can I piss in peace?  You know,  so,  yeah.  But Ozzy didn't go  with the buffer.  I know.  He was right next to me.  Oh,  so you were there first?  Oh, yeah.  Maybe he wanted to look at yours.  I don't know.  No,  I'm just fucking around.  I think there was other people  at the other urinals.  I just,  when he walked up, 
[03:19:30]  when he walked up  and I'm out there,  you have to say,  I think it's Ozzy Osbourne.  What am I going to say?  I have to say something.  I wanted to say,  he claps you.  I was going to say something  like I can relate to him  and I'm like,  you know what,  I'm not saying shit.  I'm just going to pee  and it was a nice moment,  a nice fucking time  on the show  and that's it.  And let him be.  So that's what I did.  Yeah,  it was like a phenomenal  fucking one night stand.  Right.  You fucked a 12.  Right.  You know what I mean?  She's dressing,  getting dressed to leave.  You're like,  all right,  I'll see you later.  There's no more conversation. 
[03:20:00]  Just enjoy the moment.  Let her leave.  That was fucking amazing.  We both know what it was.  Yeah,  exactly.  I know you're not going to call me  ever again.  It's fine.  There's a very good chance  when we leave in a few minutes here  and we're passing Ozzy,  not Jimmy,  but certainly I'll speak for myself,  he won't even remember  he talked to me  a half hour ago.  Exactly.  There's a very good chance of that.  I felt very  kinship with Ozzy.  It was a lot of eye contact.  I liked talking to him.  He seemed  very jovial. 
[03:20:30]  No, huh?  No, I think so.  Look at Jimmy's looking at me like,  no, idiot.  I think he realized  you were the only one in the room  that didn't really want to see his dick.  So he connected with you.  He's like,  these other guys,  I feel they're creepy.  I hid it better than everybody else.  Of course,  I wanted to see his dick.  I look so fucking fat and gay  in the picture I just...  You could have just stopped.  And that's you  trying not to look eager.  If you were sucking his cock  in that picture,  that would be less gay  than your face.  I started talking to Tony 
[03:21:00]  and he comes up  and he just kind of  claps me on the back  and puts his arm around me.  Tony, by the way,  another Tony.  No, no, Tony Dennis.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And he claps me on the back  and puts his arm around me.  So I kind of feel like  I had to get another shot.  So I finally got a shot  where he doesn't look miserable  to be talking to me,  which finally he was hugging me.  I got a good shot  where he's choking me.  I know, I'm very anxious.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  See, that's good.  Yeah, it was a great one.  I hate where we just stand,  okay, can we take a picture?  I would like it to be  something like that,  something cool.  Yeah, that's what I was...  Yeah, so that's what I showed.  How'd you get that done? 
[03:21:30]  I don't know.  He just did it.  I said, I was getting a picture.  He goes, of course.  And he just started choking me  and I just made a goofy face  and Jim saw it  and he got all jealous.  Did you try jerking off real fast  as he's choking you?  I'll do it later.  Sam got a good one, too,  of Ozzy pulling Sam's hair up.  He was fascinated with Sam's hair.  He sure was.  Ozzy's childlike.  Wait a minute.  It was really refreshing  to hear him telling...  He went through the same experience  as we all did  when we were all just partying and shit.  Partying too much  and just looking around.  Yeah, shaving people's eyebrows 
[03:22:00]  and using curtains  to fucking wipe his ass.  Going through stuff we did.  Shit in people's shoes.  Right, right.  I can see Ozzy.  The Black Jack!  Jim, did he...  I don't know if...  I didn't read the book yet.  Did he write in there  when he brought the girl  over in Japan?  No.  He brings his groupie back to the room.  He was so fucked up.  He forgot that Sharon was in the room.  Get the fuck out!  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he beat the shit out of everybody.  That's a full paw.  Yeah, I know.  Did Sharon beat up everybody?  Yeah, yeah.  Ozzy, the girl.  The girl.  Yeah, he brings her back.  He forgot she was in town. 
[03:22:30]  He was so hammered.  Oh, that's great.  Dummy.  God damn, that was good.  I'm going to read this book.  I am Ozzy.  Absolutely.  I loved it, man.  What are they,  bringing him around  to the other stations?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To the other stations?  Yeah.  He's doing an interview with Kane,  who's now in Octane.  That's cool.  Oh, yeah, Kane?  We lost our Kane.  He was on Old Nation.  I really liked him on Old Nation.  They moved him to Octane.  You don't listen to Octane?  Not as much as Old Nation.  I guess I'm showing my age. 
[03:23:00]  I'm a lithium guy.  Lithium, Old Nation, and a little Octane.  I go Boneyard.  I love the Boneyard.  I do a little Boneyard.  They go a little too deep for me.  Yeah?  I know.  Because I'm not a metalhead like you guys.  See, because I don't like the Hair Nation.  Occasionally Hair Nation.  Occasionally.  Occasionally.  But it's just too much, the Hair Nation.  Too many hits.  Too many hits?  Yeah, I think in Hair Nation.  But that's the struggle.  If I go to Hair Nation or Boneyard,  I want to hear a few hits.  But that's good, though.  It's good that they have the two,  because if they mixed them, 
[03:23:30]  then it'd be like, you know,  you hear you shook me all night long,  and then some real deep cut,  and they would fuck everything up.  So it's good that they got  the two different stations.  Yeah.  I hear you.  I love Boneyard.  Old Scorpions and...  Scorpions!  They announced they're done  after another album.  In an 18-month tour.  Three years.  Three-year tour.  Three years.  Three-year tour.  What band announces three years early  that they're going to break up?  They're going to be on the road  until 2012.  We're on to them.  That's all just bullshit.  Like you were saying about Brett Favre,  just get your name in the press, you know?  Yeah, it did.  Get people thinking about the Scorpions 
[03:24:00]  for a few days.  We're taping that metal show today,  and that's our topic.  We're going to talk about the Scorpions,  because they ain't going anywhere.  No.  They got a little more window change in them.  They've been around since 72  they put their first album.  Get the fuck out of here.  So it'll be 40 years.  Get the fuck out of here.  They formed in the late 60s.  No.  Like 68.  No way.  Yeah.  What was their first song?  Did it sound like the Beatles?  Yeah, it was all really like  jam kind of Beatles,  Beatiless,  like the first couple albums.  Yeah.  Give me a Scorpions song  from like the late 60s,  early 70s  that sounded like that. 
[03:24:30]  And then where the fuck were they  in like the entire 70s?  They didn't hit until like 76, 77,  taken by force.  Was it even that early?  Yeah.  They started getting a little...  No, and then Love Drive came out in 1979,  another piece of meat,  Loving You Sunday Morning,  they started picking up steam.  And then Blackout, 1980,  was a huge, huge stage album.  You should have like a metal show or something.  Oh, he does.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We couldn't get Ozzy on,  but it's like... 
[03:25:00]  Why?  And they were mad that VH1 people  was in and get back,  the Ozzy's people.  I'm like, look,  it's a fucking show on digital cable.  The guy's doing a Today show.  You know what I mean?  He's doing huge radio shows.  You know, so he's not...  This isn't even...  That's not even on their radar.  Sometimes you do have to humble yourself  and go, look,  he's doing other things.  I didn't take it personally.  I'm like, look,  this is...  Don't take it personally.  We're in less homes  than the NFL Network, all right?  He's fucking...  He's Ozzy Osbourne.  That's true.  Sometimes you gotta suck it up.  They're like,  we're not gonna promote his book. 
[03:25:30]  I'm like, look,  that fucking child is shit.  Oh, wow.  Oh, boy, now he won't sell any.  Yeah, ooh, I know, really.  That's gonna hurt five sales.  I was gonna say,  he'll notice the boycott, I'm sure.  Travis has one song  from their first album,  The Scorpions.  Oh, wow.  You might turn me on  to something new today.  It's pretty cool.  It's pretty cool stuff,  their old stuff.  I'm all about  Rocky Like a Hurricane,  The Scorpions hit, so...  Let's hear what this sounded like  off their first album  almost 40 years ago.  Oh, yeah,  this is a pretty cool jam song. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, Jim,  if you notice,  this sounds a little like Sabbath,  like the first Sabbath record.  Listen to when they get into it.  I've never heard this.  Wow, wait.  A little Zeppelin right there, brother.  Yeah.  Those good times, bad times.  See, doesn't it Sabbath?  Yeah, very much.  Warning, I owe me.  Yeah, yeah.  Not yet.  I never... 
[03:26:30]  You could play this  for people that know Scorpions  in and out,  and they would not guess  who this is.  No way.  Vocals kick in?  At the end of the song,  there's only like a minute of vocals in here.  It's like the LSD background music  from some movie.  This is...  A Monday night mystery movie.  This is Sabbath,  this is Zeppelin.  That's close to some Zeppelin rest  right there, man.  It's slightly off. 
[03:27:00]  Wow.  This sounds nothing like the Scorpions.  Purely John Roth was a guitar player,  real freaky.  Hendrix was heavily influenced  on this.  You a Hendrix fan?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to hear the vocals.  Light with this.  Sounds like Aquarius.  Yeah, it's fucking endless deal.  What's that, Aquarius song? 
[03:27:30]  Age of Aquarius.  Right, right.  Kind of hippie-ish.  Fucking drug-denish.  It's not bad, though.  Yeah, it's all right, but...  Sabbath?  Wow.  What that?  That sounds like a...  Free electric funeral.  That's the end of that Sabbath song.  Ironoid, right?  The War Pigs. 
[03:28:00]  Little riffs on the War Pigs.  Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.  How much time left in this?  Two and a half minutes.  All right, I'm going to hear the vocals.  Fuck it, what else are we doing with this two and a half minutes?  Let it roll.  Is that you talking?  No, it's the end.  Oh.  That's the end.  Oh, wow.  That's the end.  Oh, wow.  That ball's never there. 
[03:28:30]  Imagine I'm in you.  But it is a hand.  Sun is trying off my breathe.  My eyes connections are my pain.  I'm going to dance.  I'm going to dance.  I'm going to dance.  I'm going to dance. 
[03:29:00]  Rock.  Good.  It's not bad.  This ain't the zoo, though.  No.  This is a fun craft from the zoo.  This is groovy. 
[03:29:30]  All right.  I just had them pull up the Scorpion's Virgin Killer.  That was like their second or third.  Look at the album cover.  The girl was actually, they used to show her tits until they blurred them out.  It's almost like fucking, I know who you're talking about. 
[03:30:00]  The red-headed chick.  Not Iron Maiden, was it?  No.  No, fucking, uh, uh, the famous album cover with the chick holding the fucking airplane.  Help me out.  I can't remember what it was, but I know, I know.  Blind face.  Blind face.  Thank you, everybody.  You know, I love the computer aid.  You can just look down.  I mean, that's pretty much considered child porn, right?  Absolutely.  She can't be more than 12, 13.  That, look at blind face.  With the little nubs.  With the little English nubs.  Nice, right, Jim?  Hey, Pip. 
[03:30:30]  Nice, right?  Imagine how saggy they are now.  They were almost, they were starting to sag there.  They're like, those are like Pennsylvania tits.  A lot of chicks, they're almost like mushed in, and I don't know what happened in that state.  It's not pedophilia if it's on an album cover.  Story was, they were supposed to get her older sister, who was of age, and then she said no,  or backed out, and without asking the parents or anything, they took pictures of the younger  sister and put that on the album.  Is that real?  No shit. 
[03:31:00]  All right, let me go to Peter, because he hated that song we just played.  Peter.  Oh!  You didn't like that?  Peter.  It was like fucking druid chasing in the forest.  Give me a fucking break.  Well, it's old school.  It's like early 70s.  Yeah, man.  I didn't say it was the greatest thing we ever heard.  It was all right, though.  And what's cool is that's the scorpions.  I didn't have an idea that scorpions used to sound like that.  You guys are putting me down.  I called in a month or so ago about the Stooges, and you guys were fucking saying how bad the  Stooges suck.  So I just wanted to say...  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[03:31:30]  I know only the ones without Shemp or Curly.  When they put Curly Joe in there, Curly Joe Besser, that sucked.  I don't know enough about the Stooges to say they suck.  I just never got into them.  Yeah.  So that's where I'm at with the Stooges.  I don't have anything else on the Stooges.  Oh!  All right, Peter.  You made your point.  Toodly-doo.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  The drugs are really good back then.  Oh, the Pope likes long intros. 
[03:32:00]  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Fucking scorpions.  Look at that.  That's something that if you're on the plane, you just kind of mellow out.  You listen to something like that.  It's not something...  I can't do a whole album.  No.  Then you don't mind so much if it crashes.  At least I don't have to listen to the whole fucking song.  Yeah, maybe one or two songs, but not the whole fucking album.  That's for sure.  We get it.  Speaking of music, the who?  Super Bowl?  What do you think, Jim?  Awful.  Why?  I mean, I...  I don't expect much from these halftime shows anymore.  I know, but there's two guys left.  That's true. 
[03:32:30]  They're like 70.  You don't want to see the Super Bowl show?  You know, the who?  They were good, but I don't know.  Yeah, Townsend's not into it anymore.  Fucking adultery still wants to be the who, and Townsend rather collect child pics, you  know.  I know they're trying to give them a hard time in the NFL, but letting them in the country.  Like, the NFL finally figured out, all right, let's just go with these white artists.  They're safe.  They're not going to curse.  They're not going to pull their pants down, pull a tit out.  Yeah.  And then they don't do any research on Pete Townsend.  It was up on child porn charges over in England, and now they get caught in wind of it. 
[03:33:00]  They had no idea.  They're trying to buy every copy of the Blind Faith album.  Yeah.  Let's be honest with each other, too.  The circumstances are still a bit shady with this Townsend and his explanation.  He was on a child porn site, and he actually used his credit card to do research.  When you're buying stuff.  There was a credit card involved?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And it was buying hugs.  Because he said he was doing research, so he actually used his credit card on the site.  That's how he got busted.  It was a me credit card.  You know, they're running out of conservative acts.  Like, who's going to be...  Like, I could see ACDC doing it maybe one year, the Super Bowl. 
[03:33:30]  But after that, I mean, who...  I guess, like, country stars, maybe Garth Brooks or something like that.  But they're running low.  Because they don't want someone to pull the same shit they did with Janet Jackson and all that crap.  I mean, to this day, it was nothing.  Come on.  Do you know they're still fighting that thing?  It's still going on?  It's still fucking going on.  CBS isn't going to buckle.  And you know what?  As much as we have our problems with CBS, God bless them for still fighting the good fight.  Yeah.  They're like, hell no, man.  We're not buckling to this thing.  We'll fight this thing all the way to the top. 
[03:34:00]  Because that's easily...  I would...  2003?  2003?  I think so.  I was going to guess six or seven years.  Okay.  And they're still fighting that.  Let me go to Mac in Raleigh.  Mac?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was just saying that track you guys were playing from Lonesome Crow,  that actually was used in some German movie about drugs.  Oh, really?  Like some groovy movie?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  It was their version of Reefer Madness. 
[03:34:30]  You know, the little warning.  It's actually how they got their record deal with RCA or whatever it was at the time.  So, about that whole album, like Lonesome Crow.  It's why there's not that one.  It's not much singing because they couldn't speak English.  The other, it was soundtrack music.  That's just a rumor, what you just said.  No, that's actually true.  We always kid about this.  It's like, if someone knows something like that, this guy, it's not an insult, had no childhood.  He didn't get laid when he was growing up. 
[03:35:00]  If you know that that happened with the Scorpions, you were not banging chicks on a Friday night.  That's a story.  Well, actually, I know that I met Rudy and Klaus.  All right, you go ahead.  What's that?  I've met Rudy and Klaus.  Right, but were you like a womanizer growing up?  Did you get laid a lot?  Or were you sitting home listening to the record?  Yeah, because I was in a band, man.  All right.  You were in a band in college.  You got pussy like nobody's business, man.  You're right.  Like what Paul Stanley said, being in a band and bragging about banging chicks is like bragging about turning on a faucet and finding water. 
[03:35:30]  No, you can always brag about it.  It doesn't matter.  Okay, well, then again, we are talking about Paul Stanley here.  True.  Yeah, and actually, that was Michael Shanker on guitar, not Uli.  Uli didn't come in until Flight to the Rainbow.  But that was 72.  Michael Shanker must have been 11 then.  He was, yeah, he was 13 or whatever, and then he joined UFO when he was 14.  Wow.  Yeah, it's kind of sick how talented he is when he's sober.  You got a lot of knowledge that no one else gives a shit about. 
[03:36:00]  Exactly, man.  I mean, you know, it's how you win game shows and fucking, you know, who wants to be a millionaire?  Get on Opie and Anthony, man.  What else do you want me to do?  I understand.  Just take your opinion.  This is just a lie.  We always make fun of Eddie Trunk on the show that he knows all this obscure stuff.  Eddie's ridiculous.  It's insane.  Here's something, Eddie.  Let someone else talk.  Jeez.  I went to see Batman in some obscure fucking theater in the middle of nowhere.  I was with my girl, and there's Eddie behind me. 
[03:36:30]  Talked the entire movie.  I'm like, Eddie, I'm trying to watch a movie.  Can we do this over coffee after the movie?  Because he hasn't seen me in a while.  I love Eddie.  Don't get me wrong.  I love the guy.  Guy can talk, though.  Absolutely.  I mean, you know, he's good at it.  You know, he's fine for our show because I'm not like a big...  When I interview the guests, Eddie, you know, weaves this whole story in the question.  Sure.  And he's amazing at that.  Me, we had Joey Kramer, and I go, so, you guys write better songs when you're fucked up on drugs or sober? 
[03:37:00]  He's like, what kind of question is that?  I'm like, I'm not going to spend a minute asking, and I'm just getting right to the point.  You bang a lot of chicks?  How many do you get?  You ever have a threesome?  I go right there.  That's what I love about you, Jim.  And that's what I love about you.  You go right for it.  But Eddie's good.  We need Eddie.  I'm not trashing Eddie.  I love Eddie.  Oh, absolutely.  We've been friends forever.  Forever.  And I wish him nothing but the best, and that's the truth.  All right, why don't we get out of here?  Great day.  It was a good day.  No, it was a great day.  I am Ozzy's the book.  Ozzy doesn't need our help.  He's doing a signing tonight.  It's in the Time Warner building, and it's Columbus Circle at the Borders Bookstore. 
[03:37:30]  It's a great place for a signing.  So if you're around, go see him.  If you can't get to it, go on Amazon.  But it really is a funny book.  It's just amazing how comfortable Jim is with Ozzy Osbourne now, that Ozzy's going to be  like two blocks away from where he lives, and he's not going over there.  Yeah, that is odd.  Yeah, you're comfortable in your marriage now.  I remember the first time we had Ozzy, and I think me and Aunt were both thinking,  you know what, we'll call it in.  Fucking Jimmy's like this huge Ozzy fan.  I love Ozzy too, but look, we don't have to do any of the heavy lifting. 
[03:38:00]  We'll sit back in and watch Jimmy interact with his hero, right?  The only time I've ever seen Jimmy starstruck, and he was just staring at him.  Florentine, he was literally staring at him without asking him anything.  I'm like, holy shit.  And we had to pick up the ball and work Jimmy through it, believe it or not.  Not that he needs our help usually, but it was unbelievable to me.  I couldn't fucking talk.  He literally was just staring and couldn't.  Really?  And we were kind of pushing Jimmy without fucking throwing him under the bus. 
[03:38:30]  It's like, Jimmy, you know, and nothing.  Yeah, it was awful.  It was like the chef of the future commercial.  But I did the same thing when Gene first came in back in like 2002 at NEW.  Yeah.  I couldn't talk.  And so only those two guys, everyone else, Jimmy's right there, fucking, they'll ask him  anything.  And then Opie goes, Jimmy, you're with your hero.  You don't want to ask my question to Gene Simmons.  Right.  And I'm like, whatever happened to Star Stowe, who was a Playboy bunny that he used to do  photo shoots with?  And they laughed because they didn't know Star Stowe was a person. 
[03:39:00]  They didn't know exactly what it was.  So whatever happened to Star Stowe?  And he goes, and they laughed.  He was less not very funny.  She died.  And I was like, all right.  Oh, all right.  That was uncomfortable.  Thank you.  I had the worst moment ever.  This band Saxon, they're from England.  So I'm 16 years old.  I meet them after the show.  They had no fans.  They were in the States the first time.  They told me, my brother, hey, if you guys want to come back to a hotel and drink water,  she can.  I'm like, holy shit, this is great.  We're in the elevator with the whole band.  I'm a huge fan.  I'm 16 years old.  We're going up.  It's complete silence. 
[03:39:30]  I just go, so do you guys have elevators over in England?  That's what I fucking said.  It was the worst thing that had ever come out of my mouth.  I'm like, of course we do.  Yeah.  I'm like, okay.  The lift.  Yeah, okay.  You guys have elevators over in England.  That's what I said.  Is that one of those moments you still go back over and go, I got it.  The worst thing I've ever said in my life.  Amazing.  Worse than I'd love you to girls that I'd really, that came back to haunt me.  That was the worst thing I've ever said. 
[03:40:00]  So.  That is a bad one.  Isn't that bad?  Florentine, are you officially back in our camp or what?  Where are we at with this?  Well, we're, you know.  I fuck everybody.  That's a good way to look at it.  No, we just want you on the show more.  No, I love it, man.  It's a great hang.  I'm comfortable with you guys.  It's awesome.  What do you promote there, Jim?  This Saturday night, 8 o'clock, Bolton Center in Bayshore, Long Island.  That's the Porn Theater?  That's the theater I did that you can't do.  It's a great venue.  What did we call it when you were there? 
[03:40:30]  I don't think we were there.  Porn Theater.  We did, right?  Yeah, Porn Theater.  We just called it the old Porn Theater.  And then, yeah, the metal show starts season four, February 6th, 11 p.m.  VH1 Classic.  Dave Mustaine's our first guest.  Nice.  Very cool.  And fans in San Diego will be out there February 19th doing a show at JimFlorentine.com.  And we'll get you back sooner than later.  Certainly.  I'm going to be in LA for the next six weeks.  I guess then it'll be later.  Staying out there for a while.  In March, we'll have Florentine back.  Always a pleasure.  Jim, you're good?  One thing, Richmond this weekend, Friday and Saturday only, because I'm not doing Leno Thursday, 
[03:41:00]  so they didn't do the show Thursday.  So Friday, Saturday only in Richmond, Virginia.  I think the funny ball.  See, he's already blown you off.  See?  You should have went with Conan.  I know.  It hurts my feelings already.  Well, Jim's just not getting it done.  No.  He'll be part of the Leno's show when he goes back.  I hope so.  Absolutely.  They don't like me, dude.  I'm almost glad I'm not doing it, because I don't want to fuck it up right before they go  back to the Tonight Show.  I know my luck.  I'd say something horrendous in my last sentence on the fucking 10 o'clock show.  We're never going to have him back again.  That's pretty much it.  You're a clit hat.  Jim, why did you say clit hat? 
[03:41:30]  And your segments were great.  The ratings were great.  So yeah, you know what?  You should probably tell him you're sick and you can't do any more shows for the next month.  Yeah, I should just lay low and not fuck it up.  Lay fucking low.  Just what, before he goes off the 10 o'clock, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  That's it, I guess.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you.  Bye.  Yes. </pre>
