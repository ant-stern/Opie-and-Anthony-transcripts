<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony Cumia and Jim Norton recounting their high-speed driving experience at Pocono Raceway, detailing their participation in a stock car racing experience reaching speeds up to 170 mph in a Shelby and approximately 150 mph in stock cars.  They discussed the thrill, the physical exertion, and the differences between track and road driving, alongside safety procedures. Callers "Satan" (discussing his BMW X6), Dennis (a NASCAR enthusiast), and Mike (who recounted an unauthorized station wagon joyride at Long Pond racetrack) contributed to the automotive segment.

The conversation then shifted to New York City, focusing on Mayor Bloomberg's smoking ban in Central Park. The hosts debated the merits of the ban, touching upon personal freedom versus public health concerns and government hypocrisy.

Rich Voss joined the show and shared a graphic story about a sexual encounter in Central Park.

The show then segued into a segment dominated by sexually explicit anecdotes from Opie and Rich Vos, including graphic details of past sexual encounters and boasts about past sexual conquests, along with a discussion of Opie's earlier days in comedy. This was followed by a crude and offensive discussion about President Obama's foreign policy.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to complaints about poor customer service across various industries, sparked by a story about a New Jersey teenager denied a prom dress refund following her boyfriend's death. Listener calls further fueled this discussion.  The segment concluded with comments on the Billboard Music Awards, criticisms of Britney Spears, Beyonc√©, and Neil Diamond's performances, and a mention of Eric Stonestreet's presence at the awards show.  This section also involved a detailed analysis of a listener's bizarre and racist dream involving a chimpanzee and violent encounters with two Black men, interpreted by the hosts and a caller identifying as Dr. Chipperson. The hosts also expressed frustration over booking difficulties, particularly with securing Brian Johnson of AC/DC for Jim Norton's show.

The death of Macho Man Randy Savage became a major topic, with extensive discussion involving various conspiracy theories, humorous anecdotes (including a flying elbow drop to Jesus), analysis of Macho Man Slim Jim commercials, and comparisons to other deceased wrestlers like Bam Bam Bigelow, Ultimate Warrior, and Larry Sweeney. The hosts also discussed the deaths of Miss Elizabeth and Sensational Sherri, Savage's car accident, and  imitations of Macho Man Randy Savage, with a guest named Eric providing a particularly noteworthy impression.  The segment included mention of Jimmy Norton's interview with Brian Johnson and Malcolm McDowell's upcoming appearance, along with discussions of a physical fitness challenge for show staff and the hosts' radio format preferences. Rich Vos's upcoming stand-up shows and documentary were also promoted.

The show concluded with a brief discussion of the death of "Sensational Sherry," comments on a photograph of someone described as a "monster," and thank yous to Sam Roberts, Danny Ross, and Travis.  The hosts teased an upcoming "shit hour" featuring Macho Man Randy Savage material and Ronnie B., speculating on Ronnie B.'s departure from the "Ronnie and Sammy Sweetheart Show" and the potential for Fez's wife, Marie, to fill in. The broadcast ended with playful banter between the hosts.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  This is perfect. 
[00:03:30]  This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me.  I worked here.  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live?  No, is it happening?  This is it.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for the cream  style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going.  I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  You know, tell them what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio.  It's just like hanging out. 
[00:04:00]  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show  suspended from satellite radio.  This is why.  This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And Sam.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people.  Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:04:30]  Wee, wee, wee.  Just headphones.  There we go.  Hi, everybody.  How is everybody's weekend?  Good, I hope.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  That weekend was uneventful.  Was it?  Uneventful, yeah.  That's good.  I like those.  Sometimes, yeah.  Uneventful weekend.  Although it does tend to make him go fast.  So you feel like he didn't do anything and then Monday rolls around and you're like,  ugh, gotta get up early.  Ugh, I did nothing. 
[00:05:00]  Bleh.  Uh, well, happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  To you.  Happy birthday, dear Opie.  Happy birthday to you.  Of course, he's not going to hear that unless he listens to the replay.  Because if it was my birthday and I had taken the day off, I certainly wouldn't be up at this ungodly hour. 
[00:05:30]  Opie has taken the day off.  Yes.  He decided that.  That's something he does.  Every year, I guess.  Is turn the old screw to the boss and go, it's my birthday.  Go fuck your mother.  I'm staying home.  But what he really does is he stays home and plays a lot of happy birthday, different versions of the song.  There's probably plenty of them.  What was the one I kept hearing the other night?  I was in some restaurant.  Im got a good birthday and a naughty birthday.  Im got a good. 
[00:06:00]  I couldn't stop all weekend.  I was singing it all weekend.  Im got a good.  Im got a good.  It's the best fucking song ever.  It really is.  It really is.  The minute I started singing that in Jonathan's car, I knew I had a hit on my hands.  It's a hit.  What describes a hit?  You can't get it out of your head.  You just can't.  Im got.  Someday it's going to become a big hit and I'm going to rape a bunch of women and then kill myself.  Yes. 
[00:06:30]  You light up my life, guy.  Oh, he's great.  Isn't he wonderful?  Oh, wait.  He's dead.  Yeah, so I'll be taking the day off.  Yes.  Lucky ducky on a Monday.  Yeah.  Mondays really do blow.  We had quite an eventful weekend.  My goodness.  The fine, fine folks out at Pocono Raceway.  Wow.  We did the stock car racing experience out there at Pocono Raceway. 
[00:07:00]  Holy moly.  It's when I was driving up, you enter Pocono Raceway and you start looking and you hear like  This has to be some guy that's like the boss is away and he's giving cars to people to  drive around the track because this can't be sanctioned or legal or anything.  And then you realize, wow, they really did a good job putting this together.  It's nice and like it's safe. 
[00:07:30]  They're very safety conscious.  You rent a car and you just fucking go as fast as you want on the track?  No.  See, that would be crazy.  See, that's the crazy way to do it.  Although it would be entertaining to watch.  But you go out there and you take a class.  You know, you sit there in a little class with some hot shot driver who fills you in on everything  you should be doing and shouldn't be doing and asks you the big important question. 
[00:08:00]  Can you shift?  Can you shift a vehicle?  Well, which at that point, me and Danny just started making fun of Travis.  Yeah, well, that's the reason that I guess only me and you actually went on this little  adventure was because obviously the entire staff was welcome to come, but no one else knows  how to drive.  No one else.  I can't drive a shift.  I would have just taken my automatic out there, done a cool 65 right around the course.  Just the whole way around, right?  Beep, beep, signal.  Oh, that would have been awesome.  Could have lapped you like five times. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, you go out there and, yeah, you take the little course and then they take you out  in a van, in a big van, and they drive around the track a couple of times to give you the  feel of the bank turns and the line that you're supposed to, you know, follow.  You call it a groove, you know.  You're supposed to cut the apex of the turns and shit like that.  And then, um, how many of you were there?  Uh, let's see, it was me, it was Danny and, uh, Melissa. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, but you didn't go with other strangers in the van?  Yeah, there were other people in there, but they take you out in groups where it's, uh,  the instructor and then two students behind the instructor in their cars.  And then he goes around and slowly, not slowly, every lap he goes faster and faster.  And by the last lap, you're, you're doing pretty, uh, pretty good.  You're going anywhere between, what is that, one?  Probably, I mean, depending on your, your own skill level, you could probably get anywhere 
[00:09:30]  between like 140, 170.  Yeah.  Like 170 is like if you're really doing well.  Yeah, that's intense.  You know, there's the guys looking behind you.  I don't know, I guess I was doing about 150 in the stock car.  Well, how many, what'd you get the RPMs up to on there?  75?  Yeah, probably about that.  Yeah.  Like 150, 155.  Around that, yeah.  And, uh, it, it's, it really is something where it's like, you know, you watch stock car  racing, if you like it or not, that's your own opinion.  But, uh, when you're in that car and, and, and you just feel like, boom, boom, boom, boom. 
[00:10:00]  There's no, no fucking muffler or anything.  It's loud as fuck.  It's hot.  And, uh, it's shaky.  And then you just get in there and drive like a fucking maniac.  Those guys are shifting.  Actually, that's a, those are automatics.  I mean, I'm sorry, manuals.  No, no, they're sticks, sticks, yeah.  The, the fucked up thing is though, they take you out and by the end of the, um, by  the end of pit road, but right when you hit the track, you're already in fourth gear.  So you really don't have to shift on that track with these cars. 
[00:10:30]  It's just, you know, you got to know how to shift up to fourth gear.  It's just getting up to speed.  It's getting up to speed.  Knowing how to let the clutch out to start.  You don't want to be the guy that goes, bucking the car and then stalling it.  People laugh at you.  Do you think they would laugh at you if you did that?  Oh, they would laugh at you.  Or slide in the clutch.  And I'll tell you, like, you know, the whole lead up, you know, you're excited.  You never drove a car.  That's a fucking stock car.  So there's all this worry, like, am I going to do it good?  Yeah, yeah.  The scariest part of the whole experience is worrying that you're going to fucking stall 
[00:11:00]  out just getting out of pit road.  Stall out, yeah, leaving.  You don't want to, you don't want to be the dick that stalls.  Has anybody done it?  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm sure it's happened, but we didn't see anybody.  I was kind of hoping for it.  There was a few people that were, like, slow.  They, like, were really slow behind the other car.  And you get to pass them.  Like, Danny got to pass the other driver that was behind his instructor.  Because he sucked.  Yeah, he sucked. 
[00:11:30]  The guy was driving so slow.  And Danny's like, we have in-car cameras.  And you could hear this really slight, because it's so loud in the car.  You just hear Danny, like, yelling, I'm going to fucking move.  I want to go faster, you motherfucker.  Sound like me on my drive home.  Well, it's like, you know what?  You know, you're having this experience for the day.  You want to enjoy it to its full potential.  And the last thing that you need is some guy who's too pussy to really hit the gas  because he's scared.  How fast were you going?  Probably about the same, about 150-ish.  God, around there. 
[00:12:00]  Could you take, like, my truck probably goes, like, 100.  It's a BMW truck.  Your truck goes way more.  Oh, your truck goes faster than that.  Oh, yeah.  Would I be able to take that on the track?  Yeah, if they, uh...  But it's an automatic.  Yeah, no, that's all right.  I mean, I don't...  If you went down there, they would let you do that.  You could bring your car on there?  After all the...  Well, no, you have to be special.  Oh.  Because after all the shenanigans are done with the stock car,  I was able to take the Shelby out, finally. 
[00:12:30]  Take it out on an actual racetrack and fucking peg that thing at about 170.  Oh, that's what you were doing 170?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Fuck.  And that was insane.  You could hear the thing just winding.  The supercharger was just howling from turn three,  and you could hear it the entire way coming down the stretch.  Yeah, at first it's just la-dee-dee, da-dee-dee,  and it looks like nothing's really happening,  because we're just sitting there. 
[00:13:00]  He plays it, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a little wind in the camcorder mic.  Really, at this point I'm on the back turn three.  You could hear it now, though.  Yeah.  You could start hearing it.  It's like a torpedo.  And then the supercharger.  That's like a half mile away.  Yeah.  That was insane, insane-looking out the windshield of that car. 
[00:13:30]  Are you scared that you're going to keep going and just crash into the wall  like you're not going to turn in time,  but you're going to flip it or roll it?  No.  The only thing I was a little leery of,  in the stock cars, you don't really have a fear of anything,  because it's their cars.  It's set up to make left turns.  The whole car is set up to just make left turns on that track. 
[00:14:00]  The tires aren't the same on each side of the car.  The suspension is different.  So it's set up.  It knows that it's only making left turns.  It doesn't have to, you know, at speed make right turns.  You know, turn into the pit, obviously.  You can make a right turn and shit like that.  But, um, so you're not really worried about that.  The safety equipment in those NASCARs are unbelievable.  The harness, the helmets, the frigging...  The neck brace thing. 
[00:14:30]  The Hans they put around your neck.  It's this thing that keeps...  Actually, they came up with it after Earnhardt's accident  where he broke his neck and died.  They clip you on, so now your head is pretty much stabilized.  Your head can't move.  You can't get whiplash.  And they strap the shit out of you.  Pull those belts down and everything.  Very safe.  They're showing you where the fire extinguishers are.  And, uh, they also take you on this, um...  There's an option where you could take a ride along 
[00:15:00]  for, I guess, three laps.  Yeah, they have different ones.  Three laps with, uh, with an instructor  and you're on the passenger seat.  That I would do.  So before you go, they do that  so you get the feeling like, at first,  you wouldn't be sure,  can I hit this turn this fast?  And then when this professional is taking you around,  it's like, I don't know how the hell this car  is not just spinning out.  It's insane.  You're going really fast around curves  and you're just like,  how are we not hitting the wall?  It's very unnatural. 
[00:15:30]  Like, you're approaching a wall going really fast  and, you know, your body wants to go,  okay, now if I was him,  I'd probably get on the brake now.  But no, he just kind of just yanks the wheel,  keeps going.  No brake, no deceleration,  just plows right through the turn.  You don't touch your brake.  You don't touch the fucking brake  until you're done  and you're pulling into the pit  and you give a little brake.  You let off the gas at all or no?  Yeah, you let off the gas a little.  Bah!  Boom!  And back on it.  It's real loud.  And so with the instructor,  you kind of get the feel like,  okay, I can go fast with this thing. 
[00:16:00]  So when you get into the car  and you start getting up to speed  around some of these curves,  it's completely unnatural.  Like Danny was saying,  when you're driving your car  and you come up to a curve on the road,  you slow down,  you might give it a little brake  or something like that.  But in these,  you keep going fast  and turn the wheel thinking,  I should not be doing this.  Everything I've learned  in every year I've been driving  is telling me not to do this. 
[00:16:30]  But then you do it  and you're like, girl.  It's a tough habit to break too  because we got to do eight laps on our own.  And every time going around,  I felt myself...  Because turn one at that speedway  is ridiculous.  It's really banged.  14 degree bang.  Yeah, it's crazy.  You've got to hit it just right.  And every time I'm going around,  I knew what I was doing wrong.  And I'm like, fuck, come on, man.  Fix it!  And I keep thinking to the ride-along.  I'm like, hey, he did it.  The car is made to do it.  And every single time,  I did the same thing.  I took my foot off  and I was all pussy about it.  You could just go fast. 
[00:17:00]  You could blast around that track.  And then the straights are hysterical.  You come off of turn three  and you're real close to the wall  at that point.  You swing out of the curve  real close to the wall.  And now you just punch it the whole way  straight down the track.  Bring it up to 160.  You look at the flag man up top.  He passes by in a split second.  And you're right back into a turn one  faster than you believe it. 
[00:17:30]  I would be the fucking guy.  All I would do is the ride-along.  That would be my whole day.  I would just let the instructor  ride me around.  Some people do that.  They just do that.  They were telling me about one guy  that got in.  He was strapped in,  all ready to go.  The engines start up.  And he goes,  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  And they took him out of the car.  He couldn't do it.  And all his friends  were just fucking laughing at him.  The worst thing that happened  is his chick went.  Yeah, his chick went.  And they just were laughing.  You know what, though?  You can't even like... 
[00:18:00]  Everybody has a thing  that they don't like.  That's what it is.  Like, I don't particularly care  for roller coasters.  But, you know...  You don't care for what?  Roller coasters?  You know, so I'll shy away from that.  I don't feel like doing  something like that.  But getting into a car  that's going to do  170 miles an hour,  I'm like, yeah, okay.  Yeah.  That's fine with that.  And you can see, though,  how some people  would have some problems  with certain things.  Like, it's a bit  claustrophobic in there.  Yeah.  Because they have to take  the steering wheel off  in order to even get in.  Do they?  Yeah, they pop the steering wheel off. 
[00:18:30]  And then there's no door,  so you've got to climb in  through the window.  Wait, but it's on a regular  steering wheel?  No, it pops off.  The whole wheel pops off  and the little steering column  is just sitting there  with the little pinion gear on it.  But wait, why is it so close to you?  You can't get in and out.  It's just a better way  to have it set up  is having the steering wheel  close to you.  They've realized, like,  if your arms are straight out,  you're not going to have  as much control  as if they're closer  into your body.  What if your asshole itches?  You're, believe me,  the vibration of the car  will scratch your ass. 
[00:19:00]  Now, how long are these guys  in for when they're  doing a real race?  That's fucked up  because, now,  we did eight laps  and it's a two,  two and a half mile track?  Two and a half mile track.  We do a little math  and we'll see it's 20 miles.  It's 20 miles.  After 20 miles,  you feel like,  wow, I did something.  Like, your arms,  you have to work it  to pull the car down  into these turns,  especially turn one.  It's, you know,  14 degrees isn't that much 
[00:19:30]  for a race course  because a lot of,  a lot of them  have higher banks than that.  But you've got to  pull the car down  in order to have it  cut through the apex  of that corner  and make it the shortest  distance through the turn.  And after 20 miles,  even, you're kind of like,  wow, my wrist's  kind of hurting.  Yeah, I can feel, like,  you know, vibration.  I was trying to write  something down  and my penmanship  was Michael J. Fox-ish.  It was just like,  you can't write.  Everything's all shaken up.  And then, 
[00:20:00]  imagine doing that  for 500 miles.  The Indy 500, right?  Yeah.  Well,  that would be Indy cars,  but any of the NASCAR races.  What's the,  let me ask you,  is this the poker  where they actually  do real races here?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they got a couple  of races coming up  this summer.  And you really,  it gives you appreciation  for what these guys  do have to go through.  There's no air conditioning.  I mean,  they do have some cool suits  I think some people use.  I don't even know  if they use them anymore.  I'm not up on this.  Yeah, I'm not either. 
[00:20:30]  You could chime in  and let me know.  But it's just,  it's hot,  it's loud,  and it's fucking,  it's taxing on you.  I would do it,  like I said,  I would go around  with one of you guys  or an instructor,  but I'm a pussy  with driving.  Like, I can fucking drive,  but I can't drive like that.  I would be the guy  that got taken out,  believe me.  I would be the one  that had his girl go.  Yeah, I'd be the humiliator.  I think little Jimmy Norton  is going to come next time.  I'd go with you,  but I'd fucking keep  telling the instructor  to be careful,  there's a wall coming. 
[00:21:00]  Careful.  I'm the fucking worst.  There's a wall coming.  I'm the fucking worst  backseat driver.  You know how fucking,  I would be a fun killer.  Guys, do we really  want to do this?  I would be the fucking  fun roaner.  The guy,  I think we have the same  instructor that we took  the ride along with,  and he was the guy  that's like,  hey, here's your orange cone,  and here's where you're  going to be checking  your distance between  the other car,  or your yellow cone.  Here's your orange one,  now you're going to  roll into the corner.  And he's talking,  doing like 170 miles an hour. 
[00:21:30]  Around the corner?  He did 170?  Well, not around the corner,  but coming out of the corner  into the straight,  he barrels it up to that.  But he's just  chit-chatting with you.  As he's going that fast.  That ride along,  man,  that was insane.  I was looking at the RPM,  and there's no speedometer  in these cars,  so everything is by RPM.  Really?  If you're in fourth gear,  and you're doing like  7,500 RPM,  you could calculate  that you're doing  about 150 miles an hour.  Why not need a speedometer?  It's useless to them. 
[00:22:00]  They don't even need one.  It's extra weight at that point.  They just know  what the RPMs per gear is.  Like if you're in third,  they know if your RPM  is a certain amount  in third gear,  they know what the speed would be.  How fast are they going  when they're doing a race?  Oh, real races?  Like the professionals?  Oh, yeah,  they'll hit 200 miles an hour,  over 200.  And how fast  do they take those turns?  I don't know exactly,  but they've got to slow them down.  Especially,  it's a weird race course,  Pocono,  because there's  three different turns,  they're banked differently, 
[00:22:30]  and the radius of the turn  is different.  And the straightaway lengths  are different.  So you can't really  fall into a thing like,  okay,  I'm coming into the curve,  it's the same curve  as the last one,  and kind of figure it out.  And they get kind of flat, too,  as you go through the track,  so I've got to imagine  they've got to slow down  a little bit.  Can you imagine doing that  with fucking eight other cars  all turning?  Eight?  How about fucking 40 cars  on the track  and getting just a start  where it's got to 
[00:23:00]  just shake the shit  out of the whole place.  And then,  yeah,  how do you get through  that crowd?  Just the cars  that they had on the track,  just for the Clash,  just for the stock car thing,  when they started up,  I mean,  just that was impressive.  I can't even imagine  what it sounds like  for like fucking 40 cars.  That's got to sound ridiculous.  But I mean driving,  I would be fucking  Ted tentative  just being worried  about clipping somebody else  with tires.  Just stay in the back.  No one will get you there. 
[00:23:30]  You just stay in the back.  Yeah,  I guess that is a pretty  hard gig.  It seems easy  because you're just driving.  It's crazy.  I watched a few videos  of some crash footage  of races,  and it's weird to watch  because, you know,  having been on the track,  having been on the track,  but you look at it  and you go,  oh, yeah, that turn.  Okay.  I see.  I see why that would  have been a problem.  But it was just a blast.  The people were great.  Let me take all kinds 
[00:24:00]  of in-car camera equipment  in there.  I bought those little  contour cameras,  and they rigged up  a frigging mount  so they could put it  on one of the roll bars  and point it at me.  One's pointing out  the windshield.  Another guy climbed up  onto the frigging  scoring tower  and took video  with my camcorder.  Did that guy email you  from the flag stand?  No!  That was one of the  best shots ever.  It was like,  he took a video  from the stand  where the guy  actually waves  the checkered flag  and it's over the track  when I was driving  the Shelby, 
[00:24:30]  and it's a great  overhead view  of the thing  just whining down there.  It's fantastic.  How much gas did you use?  It was like a quarter  tank of gas  for a few laps, yeah.  Because when I usually  drive it out on the street,  I can hit the gas,  the supercharger kicks in,  and then you let off  the gas  and supercharger stops.  With this,  it was just  the whole time.  And you just go,  gas is pouring  into the engine. 
[00:25:00]  Watching the speedometer  just peg,  just burp,  it hit maximum,  which was 160.  And then still watch  the RPMs go up.  So I knew I was  going faster than that.  Wait, you went beyond  the maximum on the speed?  Yeah, the speedometer?  The speedometer just pegged  at 160.  I don't think you can do that.  Yeah, amazingly enough,  you can.  I guess you pour enough money  into a car and you can do it.  Yeah, that's what the thing is.  It's like,  they were telling me  some horror stories  of people that decide,  because the great thing is,  you can go out there,  you can say,  hey, I'll bring my car,  I'll do everything, 
[00:25:30]  and they go,  hey, sure,  it's your fucking car,  whatever you want to do.  There was some guy  that came down there  with a car,  and there's a big difference  between going out  on the street  and getting next to somebody  and going, hey,  I'll gas it,  and we'll go down  the expressway for an exit  and see who wins,  and going around a track  like this where you can  really go fast.  Your car,  a lot of cars aren't built  for that shit.  They're not made for it. 
[00:26:00]  And people have said,  wow, you poured a lot of money  into your car, Anthony.  I'm like, yeah,  it's pretty much a race car  that I could drive  on the street,  unless I'm hitting guardrails  on the way to the bank.  It's all right.  Sometimes you lose control.  Yes, that was a dumb move.  But it's all hunky-dory now.  Good as new,  it looks right.  Right as rain.  It's right as rain.  The engine,  everything's built for it.  The suspension,  tires,  the brakes,  people don't understand. 
[00:26:30]  When you're going fast,  now you've got to slow down.  People have melted  their fucking brakes.  You've got to have racing brakes.  You bring it up to 150,  and then you want to slow it down  on a corner.  You've got to hit the brakes  and then go into the corner  if you don't have a car  that's going to handle well.  You have racing brakes?  Yeah, they're giant discs,  fucking huge discs on there,  ventilated.  I've got air ducts  that actually direct air  onto the brakes  so when you're driving 
[00:27:00]  it cools the brakes off.  So one guy came in,  he had his own car there.  I think it was a Beamer  or something.  And he's driving around  and then every light  just came on at once  and the engine just went  just stopped instantly.  And smoke started coming out.  He was done.  His car,  he melted his car.  I would like to take it  around the track like once.  Yeah.  Just to do 100.  I'd be happy to do 100  on the straightaway.  It's funny because  I have no idea 
[00:27:30]  what that truck can do.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's talk to that guy.  But I don't have racing tires  or anything.  This is Satan, I believe.  Ah, Satan.  Yeah, good morning.  What's up, man?  Hi, Dev.  Hey, Jimmy,  did you get the 6-cylinder  or the V8?  I think I got the,  it was 6-8-12.  I might have the 8  because the guy  who leased it to me,  he gave it to me fully loaded. 
[00:28:00]  That was the one they had  and he gave me a good deal on it.  So I think it was the 8,  but I don't know.  I don't even know.  Dude, you have a twin turbo V8.  Okay, that thing is  fucking 400-some-odd horsepower.  You could go a little faster  than 100.  How fast can I go  on a straightaway  like at a track like that?  The governor on that car  is at 155.  Okay.  That car can easily do 155.  Okay.  How about if it's a V6,  though,  if I don't have the V8?  It's a straight 6,  but same thing on that car.  It's just you won't get to 155 that fast. 
[00:28:30]  But, I mean,  that car would go excellent on that track  because the four-wheel drive system  on that thing is fucking sick.  It can control all the power  to one wheel if it needs to.  Any one of the four wheels,  it'll automatically hit brakes  as you're starting to slip  on one wheel.  Dude, it's just insane.  The only problem with that truck,  though,  dude, I've had the truck  for two years.  The only problem I have with it,  like I have my lease is coming up  and I'm going to get something else,  I think, 
[00:29:00]  because the computer,  it sounds weird,  but the fucking onboard computer,  like the light,  like the clock  has to be reset.  I've had weird computer problems  with it,  like there's something  in the computer  that's not right.  Do you do a lot  of short-distance driving?  Yes.  Yeah, that's why.  Basically,  you're never really charging  the battery back  to full capacity.  So what happens  is basically,  the first function  to go  when the voltage drops  too low  is it loses  its steering angle position 
[00:29:30]  and the clock setting.  Listen to this guy.  If you go to the BMW dealer  and just buy a trickle charger  and just plug it in  over the weekend,  it'll just keep  the battery charged up  and you won't have that problem.  All right,  because they have many,  and I don't like  the backup camera.  I thought BMW  could have done better  with a backup camera.  What do you want,  a fucking HD  fucking Kubrick shot?  I can't tell the difference  if I'm backing  into a fucking light pole  or an eight-year-old.  I can.  If you get a new X6, 
[00:30:00]  they got an all-around  view camera now,  so you got cameras  in both side-view mirrors  and in the rear,  and it's a higher-quality camera.  Damn.  Now he's telling you  to buy a new car.  Look at this fuck.  I've enjoyed it, though.  I mean,  the guy gave me  a good deal in New Jersey,  and I enjoy driving  the thing.  It's a fun car, man.  I never had a fucking car  like that before.  It was cool.  Yeah, you need to push it, though, man.  That car is built for that shit.  Not in New York.  100 miles an hour, Satan.  Yeah, man.  Fuck it. 
[00:30:30]  New York City, 120.  Just be like Anthony, man.  All right, thanks, man.  No, I just go up and down  to the fucking comedy cellar  at Caroline's  or whatever the fuck I'm...  Literally, I do no real driving.  You could have bought  a Dodge Dart.  Dude, I'm fucking in my second...  I think in August  it was two and a half years.  I've had it for two years  since February,  and I have like  8,000 miles on it.  Really?  I do no driving.  You don't drive it a lot.  None.  I used to do 30,000 a year  on the road.  Now I do none.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's great.  What about Dennis  from the Poconos?  He's probably a menace. 
[00:31:00]  Ah, Jim.  Hello?  Hi, Dennis.  Hey, you were talking  about air conditioning.  You know, there's no air conditioning  in the car.  Usually what the drivers  have during a race  is there's a hose  that plugs into  the back of the helmet.  All right.  Sounds hot.  It's docking.  The hose plugs  into your helmet.  Yeah.  You connect to the car  like they did an avatar  with the animal.  Yes.  Yeah, that's to keep them cool.  Also, when I first started 
[00:31:30]  getting into NASCAR,  you know, I was like you,  you don't realize  how strenuous it is.  You know, you guys just did,  what, 20 miles?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They'll tell you, you know,  that these guys are in the gym  three, four times a week  working out and, you know,  how fit, like how nuts they are.  Right.  Look at him, he's getting  an animal over these drivers.  Jesus, you mo.  He didn't deny it.  Another thing about  Pocono Raceway,  that front straightaway  that Danny was saying 
[00:32:00]  he was hitting brake  every time he went  to turn one,  that's the longest  straightaway  in NASCAR racing.  And a lot of times  the drivers,  as they're hitting turn one,  are hitting just over  200 miles an hour  as they hit that first turn.  Yeah.  I don't understand  how you do that.  It's amazing.  It really is amazing.  I've always wanted  to do that,  but, you know,  you think you can get  in that car  and hit 200 just like them,  it looks easy,  but, you know.  That's one thing  I never thought.  It didn't look easy. 
[00:32:30]  It was like,  wow, these guys,  they know what they're doing.  They're working  pretty hard.  Did they tell you  what your lap time was?  No, actually,  you told me  they just give you  your RPM,  convert it to speed,  and that's pretty much it.  A couple years ago,  I'm sorry,  I threw up.  A couple years ago,  I went to the qualifying there,  and I think the guy  who qualified,  they do two laps  to qualify,  and his average lap speed  was 169.  Average, wow. 
[00:33:00]  That's pretty amazing.  I mean,  it's one thing  to hit 170,  but the average 170  Yeah, exactly.  You know,  it's just,  you know,  I'm not a fucking  race car driver,  so it was just  kind of fun  to come off  of that third turn  and goose it.  The other thing  you were talking  about,  the brakes,  I think there's a track  in Richmond,  I think it's  the Richmond track,  they'll show you,  they'll zoom in  on the guy's wheel  because they hit  the brakes a lot 
[00:33:30]  in that race,  the shorter track.  Yeah.  And you can see  them glowing  as they go  into the tire.  Yeah,  it's molten metal  coming out of  your fucking tire.  It's wonderful.  It's lit up red.  It's something.  Well,  thank you,  Dennis,  sir.  I hope this is true,  this guy Mike  in Philly  has a story  that I hope  is true.  Mike!  Hey,  good morning,  fellas,  how are you today?  What's up,  man?  Hi,  Mike.  Hey,  Anthony,  great story for you.  My brother and I  were 17, 
[00:34:00]  18 years old.  This is back  in the late 70s,  and we had a great  idea one night  to go up to Long Pond  and get into that  racetrack.  We drove over there  with my mom's  77th station wagon,  and we go down there  to the Ainsfield,  and the frickin'  gate's wide open.  So we jump in there,  and we're up there  on the track,  and my asshole  brother says,  we're going around  this track with  no lightsaber,  and I don't want  anyone seeing it.  So,  you know,  we've been there  for races,  so we knew  where the layout  of the track was,  and we're going 
[00:34:30]  down that front  straightaway,  going down  in the dark,  in the station wagon,  in the dark,  and we hit that  first turn,  and that fuckin'  car got sucked  right up to the  top wall,  and I thought the  car was gonna  flip over.  And we both  looked at each  other and went,  holy shit,  this is not for us,  and out the frickin'  door we went,  man.  But it was frickin'  wild.  One time,  me and my buddy,  I like stories  when you're 17.  It's like,  no offense,  but I kind of  had higher hopes  for that story.  Let me sum that 
[00:35:00]  one up.  Me and my friend  went for a little  joyride in a  station wagon,  didn't take the  turn as well as  we'd anticipated,  so we headed  home.  We headed home,  fucked up.  Yeah,  we thought we  were dead neat  that night.  All right,  I bet you did.  The description  in the call  looked a lot better.  Of course it did.  Broke into the  speedway,  took my station wagon.  Dead man's curve!  Thanks,  Mike.  All right,  you can't punch  out after you've  already bombed.  I love that  when he prefaced  it, too.  It's like,  great story. 
[00:35:30]  It's like,  you never say  great story  before you tell  any story.  We'll be the  judge when it's  over.  You know what  would be a  great story  if you were  sipping a  pina colada  and Scarlett  Johansson thought  you were someone  else and made  you cum in her  mouth and then  went and spit  your cum on  your own knee?  That's a great  story.  And you could  start it by saying,  I got a great  story.  Yeah,  because you  know where  it's going.  Yeah,  no one's going  to say that  story sucked  when you're  done.  Scarlett Johansson's  big tits on  your knee and  she drunkenly 
[00:36:00]  bobs her head,  falls asleep on  your dick.  That's a story.  You and your  fucking friend  in your mom's  station wagon like  fucking Daniel from  the Karate Kid.  It's not a fucking  cool story.  And dude,  I was going to  pick this girl up  and my mom,  we had to push  the car down the  hill to get it  started.  I just want to  say because they  are a sponsor  to the wonderful  people at Pocono  Raceway and the  stock car racing  experience down 
[00:36:30]  there at Pocono.  They were really  cool.  They really let us  do a lot of shit  and just the fact  that I could take  my car out there  was great.  I didn't like the  fact that they all  ask you when you  get out of the car,  would you think?  Yeah,  that is funny.  What the fuck  did you think?  It was awesome.  Who gets out of  the car going,  I hated this.  Fucking sucks.  I had to drive  here.  You know?  Some guy said  it's amazing to  watch Anthony,  your videos,  because you hate 
[00:37:00]  driving so much,  yet you love  driving so much.  Yeah.  It's great when  no one's in front  of you.  When you can  actually fucking  open it up and  drive.  Not like my  traffic-strewn videos  on the way home.  I was testing  out the  contour cameras  for the past  few days when  I drive home  from here.  So I pop them  on in the  Escalade,  and it's pretty  much fuck the  expressway or  that drive,  but it's from  here to the  Midtown Tunnel  is a fucking  nightmare.  It's a nightmare.  And then while  I'm trying to 
[00:37:30]  edit this together,  I'm watching and  I'm getting mad  all over again.  I edit and go,  yeah,  the fucking guy  was a prick.  And I've been  doing that,  so I'll probably  throw a couple  more up there  because people  find them  entertaining.  And I haven't  really had  the blowout.  And I know  the day I don't  put the cameras  on,  there's going  to be the  big blowout  with a cab  driver or some  fucking truck  or some shit.  So what?  You see that van?  See?  Fucking Sam  was just playing  it,  and the guy  in the van 
[00:38:00]  goes to just  pull out in  front of me.  And then some  guy just walks  out into the  lane I'm driving  in.  Fuck New York.  Fucking traffic.  I am so,  I'm so glad  more people are  just going to be  annoyed in this  city with Central  Park.  What's happening?  You hear what they're  doing?  No.  Starting today,  don't you fucking  light a cigarette  in all of Central  Park.  Bloomberg came out  and that's it.  I fucking hate him.  You can,  no smoky smoky. 
[00:38:30]  I just can't  fucking stand him.  He really is  just a...  He's a nudge.  Budinsky.  A Budinsky.  How about,  how about you  fucking fix  other things?  Yeah,  there are plenty of...  Like the potholes.  Yeah,  yeah,  there are plenty  of things.  God almighty,  I hate him.  Driving home  yesterday,  driving through  some of the  classically bad  roads,  the cross Bronx,  shit like that,  and you're  hitting these 
[00:39:00]  bumps and  holes in the road  that it's just  like,  what the fuck  am I paying  taxes for?  Why are the  tolls $8,  $12 for a  fucking toll  when you can't  even drive on  the roads  because they're  just full of  potholes?  I hit one,  I found a new  way down to the  cellars when I  go down there,  so I took a  shortcut,  which I can't  believe I didn't  know sooner.  And I hit a,  I think it was,  I want to say it  was on Bank  Street.  Oh, 
[00:39:30]  what a fucking  pothole.  Was it just a  bam?  It was,  it was you  drop,  I don't even  think my front  tire hit it.  I think the  front tire shot  right over and  the back tire just  fell into it.  It was like one of  those fucking  horrendous divots.  It's like,  would you fix  this?  They don't fix  the fucking  things.  the big,  and if they  are,  if they do  fix them,  it's such an  involved process  that the entire  road has to be  closed down.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  And if you're on  one of those  pothole repair  crews,  I don't even  want to hear  from you  because I  drive around  enough to see  it at work.  It is the  slowest process  I've ever  fucking seen  with vehicles  taking up much  too much room  and too many  people stand  around doing  nothing.  Fix them!  We have to  drive!  But they  ban smoking  in Central  Park now,  so you  can't smoke.  You know how  much money  they're going 
[00:40:30]  to make?  That's all.  It's another  way to get  money from  you.  Great way  to get  money.  And what  about this?  New York  gets a lot  of tourists  from overseas.  Europe,  where smoking  is a way  of life.  They're going  to be writing  those people  up?  What happens  when you get  a ticket and  you don't  live in the  country?  They just  leave and  not pay it  and then  what?  You can't  come back?  I wouldn't.  Why would you?  If I got a  ticket in  France,  I wouldn't  pay that  fucking thing,  but then I  guess you  could never  go back. 
[00:41:00]  There's probably  going to be a  warrant out for  you or something.  That is a little  annoying in the  park beach.  I guess I get  it in a way.  It is annoying  to have to smell  it, but it's  like in a way  it's just  fucking stop.  Have you?  No, no.  I've been in  Central Park a few  times and have  you ever gone,  wow, this park  would be so much  better if there  was no smoking.  You had me until  smoking.  I've said that  about certain  groups.  Yes, of course.  No, I don't  know if I ever  have.  I don't spend  enough time in  the park.  The beach, I  think I've gotten 
[00:41:30]  annoyed, like  seeing cigarette  butts in the  sand.  The beach is a  weird place because  you're in one spot  for a very long  period of time.  You're just  laying down and  if somebody's next  to you smoking,  the wafting smoke  will get to you.  Central Park is  huge, first of  all.  Most people, if  you're laying  there for some  sun, it's what,  for your lunch  break or some  shit?  You're not there  a long time.  If someone's  smoking next to  you, you can  move.  But it doesn't  seem like a  place where  smoking was ever  an issue, where 
[00:42:00]  it's like, God,  I wish people  would stop  smoking in this  giant open air  fucking park.  It is a little  annoying.  What they're  going to do  eventually, what  they're going to  ban is guys  doing poppers and  blowing each other  behind trees.  Why do you ban  that?  Hey, slow  down, Jim.  I'm not as  shocked the mayor  didn't go after  that one.  Why would he?  Our fair mayor.  Why would he go  after that?  Oh, there have  been allegations.  It's more  thought policing,  but then again,  the other side is  like, if you  smoke, I don't  want to pay  your fucking  health care.  Yeah, you 
[00:42:30]  know, there's a  grave hypocrisy  that goes on  with a lot of  things, I feel,  like the smoking  ban.  I like less  government.  And shit.  Budinskis,  less Budinskis.  But then I do  kind of like that  you could go into  a bar and not  stink like smoke.  So, then who  am I to say  something I like  doing when they  outlaw to get  all pissed off  about it?  I guess you  have to say how  much is it  fringe on other 
[00:43:00]  people's right to  enjoy their evening.  Like smoking,  the thing was...  My cock out,  doing the safety  dance at a bar.  But you wouldn't  do that in a bar.  Where you would do  it is probably when  you're a substitute  teaching, so I'm  sure it would spoil  nap time.  Another pedophilia joke.  I'm shocked.  Ran right into that  with my fucking  rabble shaking.  But you know what?  I guess that's what  it is, because I'm  an ex-smoker too,  and I can't fucking  stand it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't.  I don't even like  walking through the  little cloud that's 
[00:43:30]  outside of every  building I go in and  out of from people  that are smoking.  You walk through  that cloud, and you're  just like, stop it.  It does stink, and we  all have to pay for it  when you get a fucking  lump.  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah,  because even the  insurance company, the  rates go up, so you're  fucked.  You're paying for it.  But then, you know, to  what end, Jim?  Do you want everybody  then mandatory exercise  and mandatory diets?  How about this?  If we're all paying...  I mean, again, not 
[00:44:00]  fucking reasonless.  But again, like, then  where is the line?  Don't accept...  I'll tell you the  line.  My thing...  You think I like not  fucking eating cake?  I want to eat cake.  It's all I want to do.  But I got to tell  myself fucking no.  We all looked at  Iraq.  We all looked at  Iraq.  Thank you.  Put that there!  You know what?  This is...  Kenny just put my  breakfast down.  Yeah.  Cum in his hand.  Do you think I want  fucking egg whites? 
[00:44:30]  No.  No, I don't.  But I make myself  eat egg whites, so I  don't wait fucking...  Come on!  Yeah.  I love things that  are bad for me, but  yeah, there are certain  ones I steer clear of.  But, you know, I do  like my beers and  drinky, so what?  Am I supposed to say  don't do this, but  people will be like,  well, you know, if I  have to pay for your  cirrhosis of the liver...  Yeah, but then we  have to pay...  And to me, if you  want to ride without a  helmet, that's great. 
[00:45:00]  You should be able to,  but the insurance  company should not be  held live.  This is where you  have to side with  the insurance company.  You don't want to  wear a helmet, you  crack your head on  the sidewalk, they  shouldn't have to  pay for it.  You should have to  sell your...  If you want to  ride without a  helmet, go ahead.  I agree.  We shouldn't tell  you not to.  But don't expect me  to fucking pay for  it because you  didn't feel like  wearing a helmet.  So there's a  waiver on your  insurance policy that  would say, no, I  don't wear a helmet.  Yeah.  Well, you have to  pay a lot more if  you don't want to  wear a helmet.  It's like, why  the fuck should  everybody else pay  for your choice? 
[00:45:30]  You should have  your choice.  Just be willing to  fucking foot the  bill if it causes  you a problem.  All right, but then  hi, Mr. Rich Voss.  Come sit down.  Have a seedy doodle.  Have a seedy doodle.  I don't just come to  a party.  Exactly.  I wasn't...  A lemon party.  I wasn't...  You know...  Hi, Rich.  But God, if we  couldn't smoke in  Central Park, can you  imagine what a  nightmare that would  have been?  God.  Whole smoke.  Get that bad  taste out of your  mouth.  When I ate the 
[00:46:00]  girl's ass?  Oh, right.  Were you smoking  at the time?  Oh, yeah.  I was smoking  ashes on her  back.  He's eating her  ass.  Looks like a kid  in candy.  I'm getting  blown.  He's eating her  ass.  And we're driving  home.  I go, you  have fun?  I got my  pants dirty.  No, I said  my legs are  sore.  I was squatting  and you know  the story.  And he goes,  why didn't you  kneel?  Because I  didn't want to  get my pants  dirty.  I'm straight  someone's ass.  What, were you  like fucking  like a catcher?  Yeah.  I was like  squatting down.  You had to see  the look on the  girl's face.  You know, she  would blow me  and all of a sudden 
[00:46:30]  the tongue goes  in her ass and  her eyes just  lit up.  That's all you  saw too because  she was a black  girl and it was  late.  Just two eyes.  And it was  great because  when we were  done she was  home.  You ate a  black girl's  ass in Central  Park.  She was so hot.  We met her  outside of  SOB's.  She was hot,  man.  She recognized  this is how  fucking zeroes  we were.  She knew  Voss from the  fucking Boston  Comedy.  Wow.  Boston Comedy  Club.  Yeah,  I go to  her.  How do you  just break  the ice  with hey,  can you  blow me  in the  park one  day in  the merry 
[00:47:00]  merry  He's going  for the  long  tongs.  What happened  we were going  to eat  bagels and  she recognized  me and  then she  came with us  to eat  bagels and  we said  we're going  to go up  to the  peep booth.  No,  we got the  bagels on  54th.  54th and  Broadway was  the bagel  place and  the peep  booth place  was fucking  three doors  down.  That's  convenient.  Yeah,  you get  white fish  We're up  the floor  of the  peep booth.  Put a  little schmutz  on your  bagel.  We would  go fucking 
[00:47:30]  the boss  really was  fucking  juice squared.  He would  take me for  white fish  bagels at  two in the  morning.  That was  the fucking  greatest.  Wow.  They were  good bagels.  They were  wonderful.  Just two  guys in love  back then.  I give a shit  about the  bagels.  How'd you  get the  girl to  me at  the diner  on Route  22?  We would  meet at  the fucking  diner and  go into  the city  together and  get bagels  after.  One night a  black girl  recognized him  and we took  her for  bagels.  He took  her into  a peep  booth.  You took  her into  a peep  booth.  That kind  of lets  everybody know 
[00:48:00]  the kind  of personality  the girl has.  Then we were  standing.  We got  kicked out of  there.  Then we were  standing between  my car and  a newsstand.  She has a  skirt.  I'm making  out.  I put my  finger under  her skirt.  a finger  and he's  standing behind.  Does she have  panties on  under her  skirt?  Have those  been removed?  I went under  them.  He's standing  behind her  just squeezing  her ass like  it's a  Charmin's  commercial.  I squatted  down.  I just started  kissing the  cheeks of her 
[00:48:30]  ass a little  bit and  caressing them.  You were  feeling it  out like  is this  okay?  Broadway and  54th Street  we were  parked.  It was  right between  Voss's car  and a newspaper.  Didn't Bud  Friedman go  by?  He did  that show  at  Caroline's  that night.  Did he  see us?  I don't  think we  were.  I think I  stood up  and we  were just  standing  there at  the moment  and we  were just  like Bob  almost caught  me fucking  my face  in her  dumper.  This  fucking  monocle.  Jimmy,  one thing 
[00:49:00]  that fascinates  me,  how did  you know  that that  would even  be okay  with anyone  else?  Like with  Voss or  the Flex?  I knew it  would be  okay.  But with  her,  Voss was  a good  team player.  He got  so many  chicks back  then.  He was  always trying  to get  his ugly  friend laid.  I was  the fat  chick that  he was  hanging out  with.  We were  doing a  gig in  Harrisburg  or somewhere  and I was  begging the  maid to  take him  in the  closet.  Look at  my dick.  And just  look at  it.  If she  looks,  that's the  start.  Or she 
[00:49:30]  was a  waitress  or a  maid or  something.  I don't  know.  She was  a waitress.  And the  maid was  in charge  of the  IMF.  Oh,  man.  So,  how did  you get  into the  park?  Why did  you go from  the car  to the  park?  It was  just a  place to  be alone.  I lived  in New  Jersey.  He lived  in New  Jersey.  So,  what,  the car  was too  small?  No,  no,  no,  yeah.  We were  driving around  after she  bused and  I go,  where are we  going to  go?  It was  warm out  and we  climbed the  wall of  Central  Park. 
[00:50:00]  She  went over  with it.  She was  actually the  radio chick  from the  movie.  Sorry  about that,  warriors.  Jim,  I had a  little nugget  fall out.  Sorry  about that.  So,  yeah,  it was fun.  You went  into the  park and  found a  little  I think  he made  out with  her and  she started  sucking  his dick  and I  just  fucking  went to  town and  ate her  ass and  her pussy.  I was a  trooper.  She blew 
[00:50:30]  me too  though.  Oh,  she did?  Yeah.  To  fruition?  Yeah,  I don't  remember if  I came  or not.  Huh?  I don't  remember if  I blew  a load  or not.  On the  other night  on stage  I told  the story,  matter of  fact,  the one  about I  was working  at Caroline's  and I  was staying  for some  reason at  the Marriott  or they  were at  the Marriott  across the  street.  I met  these  ladies.  One,  if we  were lucky,  was a  two.  The other  one was a  negative  seven.  Norton's  working  Dangerfields  and I  called  him. 
[00:51:00]  I said,  I got  these two  ladies.  I never  seen a  guy get  across town  so quick.  I'm telling  you,  it was like  he was  passing the  Batmobile,  right?  So we go  back up to  this fucking,  I don't  know,  it's just a  quick reference.  It's early  still,  okay?  He went  for the  long  tons.  He's a  pro.  I love  my bank.  So,  these  ladies are  horrific. 
[00:51:30]  Horrific.  He knows  the story.  Oh,  you know  the story?  So I'll  tell it.  Well,  there's always  a new  listener.  I like  a new  angle on  the same  story.  So you  fucked  some  pigs?  No.  No.  I was  trying to  hit on  the fucking,  we went  to their  room and  I was  hitting on  the fucking  the minus  seven and  Vos takes  the two  in the  fucking  bathroom and  she was  getting  married in  a few  days,  like her  fourth  marriage.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And I  was having,  I was  striking out  with fucking  awful.  So after  he was  done,  I went 
[00:52:00]  in with  the girl.  I begged  her.  Well,  I didn't  beg her.  I told her  you just  got out of  rehab and  you haven't  been  with a  golf ball.  I didn't  know that.  I thought  she liked  me,  man.  How were  you getting  turned down  by the  fucking  minus  seven?  Well,  it's a  minus  five.  I'm not  exactly an  eleven.  I must have  pissed you  off though,  this fucking  bitch.  I was so  irritated.  But he  was in  the bathroom  and whatever.  I tolerated  her.  And then I  went into  the bathroom  after.  And I  fucking,  I actually 
[00:52:30]  made out  with her.  Dude,  I don't  know why.  I was  just horny.  But that's  not the  kicker.  You would  come in  her mouth?  No.  Well,  she was  blowing me  and stuff.  And then I  asked Norton,  did you make  out with her?  And he  said,  yeah.  I go,  well,  she had  her tongue  up my  ass.  I said  to boss,  I think  before I  asked him,  did she blow  just fool  around her?  I just  fucked her.  I forget  what he  said,  but he  indicated  that she  didn't do  anything  with the  mouth that  I would 
[00:53:00]  object to.  And then  afterwards,  I learned  the error  of my  ways.  Is that  indeed?  That was  so much  fun back  in the day.  You could  just get  pussy.  You're  married now.  But if I  was single,  being older,  and what's  going on,  I don't know  if it's as  easy to get  late.  When I  used to do  comedy,  it was  like girls  would just  come up  to you  out of  nowhere.  I remember  one time I  was working  a gig in  Somerville,  and if 
[00:53:30]  Bonnie's friend  is listening,  Maria,  this is way  before I was  married.  Okay?  Actually,  you have to  make an  excuse now.  I remember  this girl  came,  within five  minutes she  was blowing  me in the  coat room.  And she  was a  hottie.  And I  was horrible.  I had  bad teeth  and long  hair.  You know,  bad.  The good  old days.  Shouldn't  you be  running for  breakfast?  Oh,  dear. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah,  breakfast  feet.  There's the  famous photo,  yeah.  And you  were getting  blown in  coat rooms.  It was just  crazy.  Just horny  chicks.  What years  were these  about?  Early 90s,  right?  Was it  early 90s?  20 years  ago,  I guess.  20-something  years.  And were  they quality  girls?  Yes.  Really?  When I was 
[00:54:30]  in Vegas,  I picked up  this girl.  I was  working with  Jay Moore.  Brandy,  she was  smoking.  I remember  that.  In Reno,  I'm at  the show  in this  girl's show  with her  mom.  She's a  dancer.  A 10  between  shows.  She says  to her mom,  we're going  to take a  while.  I go  up to  my room  and everything.  It was  insane.  What happened?  You're just  going,  did she  blow you?  Did you  fuck her  in the  ass?  Did you  come inside  of her  and make  a baby?  What  happened?  One girl,  I was  in Vegas  fucking  this girl  and I 
[00:55:00]  wanted to  gamble  so bad  when I was  talking about  the show.  So did she.  So I  told her I  was going,  I swear to God,  it didn't  happen,  but I'm  going down  for a  bagel.  She goes,  if you  get me one,  you can fuck  me in the  ass.  That's  for a  bagel.  Wow.  That's a  bargain.  I would have  got her a  bagel.  Yeah,  of course.  You know.  Yeah,  yeah.  Huh?  No,  I lost the  money.  I couldn't  get her  the bagel.  Atrocious.  No,  I wouldn't do 
[00:55:30]  that.  Just fucking  some stranger  on the  ass.  That's  disgusting.  Okay,  yeah,  I get the  drift.  I don't  know.  Back to,  I don't  know if  comics now  story.  It was  another guy  and Voss  actually said  that to  him.  Fuck me in  the ass.  I get  you a  bagel.  Worst  possible  scenario.  I put  the bagel  right by  my ass.  Oh,  yeah.  You're a  smart guy.  I try  to be.  He said 
[00:56:00]  that in  the mirror  so many  times.  Now,  I don't  know how  I can  make this  scenario  sound  legitimate,  but say  you lived  on a  cul-de-sac  or a  warm  sack.  You  had  say  like  a  two  bedroom  house,  a little  two  bedroom  house.  All the  houses  around you  were like  six and  seven  bedrooms,  but everybody  on the  block hated  you.  They all  hated you.  The Walton  or something.  Okay.  Then one 
[00:56:30]  family gets  kicked out of  their house,  right?  And the  mortgage  company calls  you and  says you  have to  take that  family in,  but they're  not going  to recognize  you're the  owner of  the house.  Would you  take them  in?  The fuck  is this?  I don't  know what  you're  talking about.  You're  talking about  Israel and  the borders.  Oh,  I got  you.  No,  I wouldn't  take them.  Thank you. 
[00:57:00]  Unless they  were blowing  me and eating  my ass.  I like his  analogy.  That took me  from the  turnpike to  the tunnel.  You thought  it up yourself  or you heard  that?  I thought  of that one.  Just my  analogy.  Just insane.  I like that  your Jew  comes out  when these  national events  happen.  Well,  because you  hear,  well,  it's crazy.  You know,  here's my  theory.  Strap in.  Well,  the Arab  world is not  too happy 
[00:57:30]  with our  president  after what  we did  in Pakistan.  Pakistan's  pissed off,  other Arab  countries.  So how do  we appease  the Arabs?  I don't think  anyone's that  pissed off,  to be honest,  with Kilbin  Laden.  A lot of  them hated  him,  and I think  everyone knew  that he had  to be,  they all knew  we were coming  after him.  You're right.  That's a  legit shot.  No surprise.  To go into  their country.  Oh,  fuck Pakistan.  What are they  going to do?  Well,  you're right,  nothing.  But they're  still pissed  off.  You don't  think we'd  be pissed  off?  But are  they pissed  off?  If we  caught  operatives 
[00:58:00]  in this  country,  but are  they pissed  off or do  they have  to say  they're pissed  off because  they have  radicals?  Yeah,  because they  got crazy  people over  there.  Okay,  so to  appease them,  we go,  all right,  what can we  do to,  you know,  jump on  Israel and  say that  you want to  give up  some of  their land?  Yeah.  So that's  what you  think Obama's  doing?  Well,  I don't  know.  It's not  going to  hurt his  PR.  You know,  there's a lot  of Arabs  in this  country that  will be  voting in  2012 or  whenever it  is again.  I think 
[00:58:30]  there's more  Jews that  would vote  for Obama  than Arabs.  I think  so.  Don't Jews  tend to be  a little  more on the  Democratic side?  Oh,  yes.  But there's  only how  many percentage  of Jews  compared to  Arabs in  this country  are there?  I think  there's a lot  more Jews  than Arabs.  By the way,  you lost me  on the smart  theory when  you said  how many  percentage?  How many  percentage?  Whatever.  I just  have my  Voss translator  on.  I'm not  even hearing  it.  There's 3% 
[00:59:00]  Jews in  this country,  so you  say maybe  1% or  1.5%  are voters.  1.5%  of this  country are  Jewish voters.  How many  Arabs are  there in  this country?  Exactly.  I don't  think it's  more.  If you look  at a state  like New  York, which  is a pretty  important state  democratically,  you've got a lot  in the city  especially, you've  got a pretty  high Jewish  voter base  that you don't  want to alienate  by turning 
[00:59:30]  your back on  Israel?  Well, by  him saying  that, you  don't think  he's...  Appeasing  the friggin...  Well, you  don't think he's  destroying his  relationships with  the Hebrews?  I think he is,  but I think it's  out of this  stupid political  correctness  bullshit and  his love for  the Muslims and  wanting to  appease them.  So you  just said  appease  the Muslims.  But not so  much appease  them for  things we've  done, but I  think it's just  a constant  thing of just 
[01:00:00]  he'd rather  the Muslim  world love  him than  anything else,  it seems.  That just  seems to me.  He's constantly  doing things  where it's like  we've got to  have Muslim  fucking, some  kind of Muslim  appreciation day.  The guy, I  don't care what  he calls himself  now, religiously,  he was raised a  Muslim, I think  he still has  that...  Wants to, you  know, give him 
[01:00:30]  a little boost  wherever he can.  Much to the  chagrin of the  Jew.  Where, doesn't  he, I mean,  doesn't he have  advisors?  I mean, they  couldn't...  Not a one.  He's not  listening to me.  He just goes  all alone and  I have no idea  what he has.  And he's got a  bunch of clowns  around him.  Yeah, when I  watch 2040, you  know, the  presidents always  have millions.  That's how he  gets his  information.  Look, I have  to eat this  sandwich.  This sandwich.  So, we're  going to take a  break and we'll 
[01:01:00]  be back with  the lovely and  talented Rich Voss  who, where are  you going to be?  I'm going to  plug this date.  It's a couple  weeks down the  road because I  haven't been, it's  in Buffalo.  I haven't been to  Buffalo in about  six or seven  years.  Oh, wow.  So they'll forget  the material.  I got tons.  I'm coming out  with my third  CD.  I know, Rich.  It's called  Knitschies  musical.  It's a musical.  Wow, was that a  hard word for you? 
[01:01:30]  Knitschies, is that  it?  No.  How do you say  that?  How do you say  it?  Oh, no, no, he  didn't say that.  Let me see the  word.  Say it again.  Say it again, Rich.  I'll tell you if you  got it right.  Knitschies.  Knitschies is  what it is.  It's Knitschies?  Yeah, not  Knitschies.  Have you heard of  it?  It's a music venue.  It's a music venue.  It's a music venue.  You can't really say  Knitschies if it was  Knitschies.  It's Knitschies.  I can say what I  thought.  It's Knitschies.  Knitschies.  Tell me.  That's what it is?  Knitschies, yes. 
[01:02:00]  Like fucking the  philosopher.  Oh, yeah, that's  what Bonnie told me  last night.  Knitschies.  Is it Knitschies?  Knitschies.  Knitschies, yeah.  Knitschies.  Wait, hold on.  Try it.  Knitschies.  No, that was a  bad one.  Wow.  Knitschies.  Oh, perfect.  Perfect.  It wasn't perfect.  Wow.  What happens to the  inside of your mouth  when you make that  sound like ch?  Yeah, ch.  It's my jaw shifts.  Where does it go?  Shifts into neutral.  Yeah.  Knitschies.  That was perfect.  That was good right there.  It wasn't good. 
[01:02:30]  Yes, it was.  It wasn't.  Yes, watch.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Knitschies.  Knitschies.  See, it gives that one.  You're punching out  from the floor.  It's not that bad.  It goes instead of  Okay, well, I'll be in  Buffalo at Knitschies.  Hey, there you go.  Knitschies.  Knitschies.  Make a hard sound.  Knitschies.  Friday.  It's like cheese on your  knees or something.  17.  17.  Stupid.  My new nightclub's open.  Yeah, what's it called? 
[01:03:00]  Scandals.  Of course it is.  Knitschies.  Scandals nightclub.  Yeah?  Scandals.  What's the motif?  Just to make bunny.  No, no, no.  Not motive.  What's the decorative...  What's the vibe?  Bunch of seashells and stuff.  Oh, yeah?  And like nets,  like you caught whales in them.  Oh, so it's kind of a nautical  kind of an atmosphere? 
[01:03:30]  Everybody behaves.  Why is it called scandals, then?  There's lots of scandals happening.  I would think if it was scandals...  Is it like dark, dimly lit?  Like rich?  Thank you.  Nautilites are all on full blast.  That's not much scandal can happen.  That's why they're on there,  because everybody's got some scandals.  Oh, the name alone will bring it in.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  They messed up the sign, though.  Yeah.  They forgot to see.  So everybody's just been wearing sandals.  I gotta get that fixed. 
[01:04:00]  I'm gonna spell it with a K.  Scandals.  That's K.  But that seems to go with the shells  and the netting  and the beach kind of thing.  But notice,  the K is gonna be like,  there's gonna be a K over it  with an arrow in.  Scandals.  So you don't have to bring back  the original sign, right?  Yeah.  My friend made it.  Well, we'll all look for it.  Thank you, Chip.  Can I have any ketchup?  Yeah, we'll get some ketchup  and I'll be right back.  The Virus Sirius XM. 
[01:04:30]  This is the Opin' Entry Show.  Opin' Entry.  Well, today,  it's Anthony, Jimmy,  and Rich Voss.  Thank you, Rich.  You guys,  I gotta hand it to you  that you can do this.  I woke up at 5 o'clock  as I'm walking downstairs  to have my coffee.  Have my coffee.  And I'm going,  I think I'm gonna blow this out.  Yeah, yeah.  You know,  I'm going in my head,  do I do that?  And I'm sitting drinking it. 
[01:05:00]  I go,  I'll make my decision by 5.30.  Yeah.  That is my mental conversation  with myself  every single morning.  Yeah.  The second the alarm goes off,  I try to think of a way,  and it only lasts  for a few seconds,  but it's every morning  I try to think like,  maybe I could just call someone.  Maybe I,  is there,  I'll call Travis,  Travis,  and maybe he can like  square things out  with this one or that.  And then I realize  it's just futile,  I'll get in fucking trouble  up the ass, 
[01:05:30]  I'll fuck it.  So I'm just like,  I get out of bed.  And then once you're up  and out of bed,  then you're going to work.  But when I'm just laying there  and the alarm goes off,  the paramount thing  on my mind is  I don't want to function  this early in the morning.  Well, here's the difference is,  okay,  it's worthwhile for you  to come in,  look at your house.  I have nothing to gain or lose.  Maybe four people  will come see me in Buffalo.  Maybe.  Maybe four.  Right.  Nothing but negative printing  all over the place.  Did you hear how he talked?  Did you hear what he said? 
[01:06:00]  Oh, look,  he messed that one up.  Oh, what O&A comic  did you hate  and now you love?  You know,  this, that,  oh,  going back from song break.  Go anyhow.  You know what I mean?  So there's not a lot  to gain out of it.  Yeah.  Except having fun  and hanging on a radio.  That's true.  But, you know,  as far as financial things go  or anything,  there are some clubs  that I'm sure the plugs  work good for.  For who?  Maybe not so much.  For who?  Bobby?  No, 
[01:06:30]  I don't mean people.  I mean,  the best,  the best for me,  O&A is like Philly,  obviously,  or Stress Factory.  And Utah was good.  Salt Lake.  Wait, was that,  because I just got offered  that gig,  I didn't turn it down,  but I'm not going to do it yet.  Is that good?  Yeah, it's good.  Those O&A fans in Utah,  I mean,  I don't know if the guy's  going to have me back.  I think he's pissed.  Why?  I don't know.  A lot of fat people in Utah.  Because my,  stop chewing the gum.  The only thing I could think of, 
[01:07:00]  here's the deal,  why he might be pissed.  Didn't I tell you  the story about the bonus?  This is the only thing  I think he could be pissed at me.  My bonus,  if it was a small club I did,  if I did over a certain amount  of people,  I got an extra $500.  Nice.  Right?  So I came up 10 people short.  Oh, shit.  So I bought the tickets  at 10 apiece,  that's $200.  So I got a $300 bonus.  You fucking,  oh, you shyster.  Why?  Because my expenses,  my travel,  everything.  Is there a drink minimum? 
[01:07:30]  Well,  he's got three clubs.  He's got three clubs.  Hold on.  Is there a drink minimum?  Is there a drink minimum?  Oh, I don't know.  Here's why that matters.  Yeah.  Because,  oh, wait.  Is it tickets  or total gross  on the fucking,  here's why I'm asking you.  Because if it's tickets sold  and people in the club,  then the club motor might go,  well, that's fucking,  I've lost a minimum  of two drinks  on every one of those  because there's a minimum.  But then again,  if it's total gross  on the box office,  the drink minimum  is irrelevant.  Well,  all I know is,  are you booking yourself?  All I know. 
[01:08:00]  No, here's the thing.  The club owner's cool.  He listens to O&A.  So now what happened though?  Did he pay you?  Well, yeah,  that's smart.  He should tip his hat to you.  Here's the thing.  There are two things  that could be.  All I know is,  I killed there.  It was a great club.  And it was great.  I did the street room.  He has three rooms.  Two of them are like big rooms.  How big?  Three or something  hundred seaters, I think.  I mean,  Bellamy was there  the week I was there  in the big room.  How big was the room?  That's the big room?  How big was the room you did?  It was a small room.  I did.  It was a small room. 
[01:08:30]  Remember Jay Moore  was talking about it.  It's a great room.  It's in downtown Utah.  So the only thing  I could think of  because he was at the club  one of the shows  and I was killing  is the bonus  or the fact  that I was saying  to a waitress  come back to the hotel  with me.  But, you know,  I'm only messing around.  I'm just being a scumbag  because I'm married.  You know,  if she said yes,  I would have panicked.  So,  but maybe he's not mad at me.  Maybe he just doesn't  answer emails after.  You know,  I wrote back to him  going,  I had a good time. 
[01:09:00]  I hope,  you know.  How did he,  well,  how did he know  you bought the tickets?  The manager told him.  I told the manager,  I said,  if I don't hit the number,  if I get close,  I'll buy the tickets.  He goes,  yeah.  And he told the owner that.  So I don't,  I don't even know.  Maybe the owner's not pissed.  How many people are sitting  in the club seat?  The one I did?  No,  the one Bill Bellamy did.  Of course the one you did.  You're not going to do that,  so it's irrelevant.  No,  it's not.  I'm trying to wonder.  It's like 100 people,  the one I did seat.  It seats like 100,  110,  I think. 
[01:09:30]  You know,  so,  and it has some good comics there,  though.  I'm looking at,  is that them wise guys?  So you bought 10% of the tickets?  Kevin Pollack.  All right,  they have some fucking real,  yeah.  The other room has got to be  bigger than 300 if they're doing  Gilbert,  they're doing Kevin Pollack.  I guarantee the other room  is like 550.  No.  No,  I don't think it's that many.  I don't know.  I don't know.  How many shows a weekend?  What am I,  fucking I just,  mine was four,  because I was in the small,  I guess it's four,  two and two,  or maybe one Thursday.  I came in early to do radio, 
[01:10:00]  and the radio was fun there,  too.  Patrice.  The radio guys were great.  They got along.  Ralphie,  yeah,  they're getting,  Patrice Ralphie,  Jim Brewer's doing it,  fucking Madigan.  Aren't they having real,  real comedians?  Cassidy Madigan shows out  everywhere.  That shows all,  that's why I love her  with real comedians.  Well,  she buys her own seats.  Yeah.  10 tickets,  big deal.  The extra 300 made up,  it made up for my rental car.  What did you do with the tickets?  Just throw them out?  Huh?  I didn't get the tickets,  you fucking idiot. 
[01:10:30]  I just bought the seats.  So why did you say,  look,  give me 300,  I missed it by 10.  Oh,  well,  I didn't actually know  why I said that.  Right,  right,  he's here.  I don't know.  Maybe the guy's not pissed at me,  maybe he just doesn't answer email.  Alls I know is I want to go back  to this place.  Alls I know.  There's one story  that's really been bugging me.  Alls.  What's that?  I don't know.  This fucking,  this is how jealous I am.  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  I thought he was,  he was going over his lines  for a TV show  or a movie.  Fuck. 
[01:11:00]  Voss is a boob.  No.  What happens is  when we have these prep sheets,  we have stories.  This one is the New Jersey teen  that wanted the prom dress refund  and this story has me  fucking out of my mind.  So what Travis or one of the guys  will do is go over  and yellow highlight  certain parts of the story.  So if we're on the air  and we just pick it up  and look at it,  we kind of can go to  the yellow highlight areas  instead of reading the whole thing.  Got the gist.  Makes it a little bit easier.  So that's how you would also  highlight a script.  So Voss thought  that I had a script.  You're right. 
[01:11:30]  It's a fucking,  it's a show I'm doing.  How did he,  how does he memorize  all those lines  because it was like four pages?  Wow.  Yeah.  But this,  this girl,  I just fucking hate,  do you know the story?  No.  I've been,  I've been incommunicado  for the weekend.  She's,  I just read it last night.  She was in New Jersey  and they had,  the prom dress  has a no refund policy place.  And it's just like most girls,  she was on her way to,  she was going to the prom. 
[01:12:00]  Tragedy struck last week.  Her boyfriend of two years  was killed in a car accident.  Jesus.  It was a two car crash.  She was honestly home  from a little baseball team dinner.  She bought her $1,200 dress  from this fucking,  at Freeholds,  Diane and Company.  It's,  it's,  it's known from the popular  oxygen show,  Dress Couture,  which I never saw.  It sounds awful.  I watch oxygen all the time.  So she wanted a refund  so she could help pay  for her boyfriend's funeral expenses.  Wow.  And the mother approached the store  and they said it's against store policy. 
[01:12:30]  So they offered her a credit.  The mother fucking said  that when she showed up  to bring the dress back,  they were nasty and unsympathetic.  And the company goes,  no,  we didn't do that.  Over the phone,  they said it's a terrible,  tragic situation  has been spun out of control.  It's not trying,  we're not trying to be vicious,  strong, compassionate.  We're faced with tragedy  all the time.  What?  Fucking asshole.  How much tragedy  are they faced with  all the time?  Probably people getting dumped  and broken up with  and my boyfriend cheated on me  and my boyfriend would.  That's not tragedy,  that's reality. 
[01:13:00]  It's just shit that happens.  They offered to make a donation  to the memorial set up  and fuck that store.  Give her the $1,200 back.  How much was the dress?  $1,200.  What a fucking...  I'd cough up $1,200.  I'll tell you,  if I worked for that store,  I would have said,  hey, I'll take her to the prom.  But what a fucking...  It just makes me fucking crazy  what scumbags...  Yeah, that is a scumbag.  ...people are.  Wow.  So maybe I'm wrong.  If anybody knows more  and Freehold's Diane & Company  is not that type of store,  but they sound like fucking shit 
[01:13:30]  if that's the truth.  They offered to make a donation  to the memorial fund,  but they refused to give a refund.  What fucking scumbags.  Wow, what the hell is going on?  What fucking scumbags.  Diane & Company, huh?  What scumbags.  I bet they're getting some shit.  The girl's...  Her boyfriend is killed?  A fucking 16-year-old's...  It's a...  Oh, it makes me fucking...  So irritated.  It's not like your fan base  is going to proms.  No one's going to go with them.  They're usually out of school  by that point.  Their protest page on Facebook  now has more likes 
[01:14:00]  than their actual Facebook page.  Good.  People should fucking...  They should be blasted on Facebook.  $1,200 fucking dollars.  Or on Twitter or whatever.  It's almost like  if you're going to be  that big of a scumbag  as a company  and you can't make...  That's the example  of not making an exception.  The fucking girl's boyfriend  is killed.  Even if she didn't want  to pay for the funeral.  Even if she just wanted  her money back on the drugs  because her boyfriend's dead.  Is that them?  Mm-hmm.  Fucking assholes.  Okay, they look...  Yeah, yeah, okay.  They look like fashion people.  Ugh.  Yuck. 
[01:14:30]  We're faced with tragedy.  You know what I mean?  So really, how many...  I would love to know  how many times  every year  somebody's boyfriend  is killed  and you...  And somebody asks you  for a refund  like a week or two  before the prom.  Yeah.  How often does that happen?  Oh, it happens so often  we'd go broke  if we gave refunds.  I'll give her a refund  you fucking pricks.  I say we take a drive  and get her the money.  We could do it.  Oh, really?  Bust some legs?  We could easily just fucking...  No, I should...  Believe me.  Do a fundraiser.  She will get the money  from other people 
[01:15:00]  and this place  will get the grief.  You know,  that's somewhere  where somebody  should have to  fucking apologize.  Not this political  correct bullshit  that everyone  apologizes for every day.  How about a situation  like that  where somebody actually  fucked with somebody's  life like that?  A bunch of pricks.  Well, the only way  is for people  to let them know  how fucking disgusting...  It's like, that's just...  You face these companies, man,  and there's no humanity  in any of these fucking people.  In the airlines,  in retail stores,  there's just... 
[01:15:30]  That's policy.  That's policy.  That's policy.  That's policy.  Oh, really?  It can't be changed?  Who the fuck made it?  I had a big fight at Target.  My wife is sitting at Target.  We knew it would come back to him.  No.  No.  No, about policy  because I was getting  Nicorette gum  and the guy asked for ID.  Of course you are.  Asked for ID.  I go, really?  I'm not...  Why?  I don't...  Really?  But they're so...  I'm trying to say  they're so programmed...  Why were you buying  a short ethnic guy gum?  None of...  Nobody.  Oh.  No, this gum works.  Nobody...  Nobody...  Can make an executive decision. 
[01:16:00]  No.  They just...  They can't.  That's why they have those jobs.  That's why they're just so stupid.  And I was agreeing with you,  but I haven't...  No, I'm teasing, man.  But the airlines are like that,  like the flight attendants.  No one can make...  Somebody tweeted me  about Continental or something.  They get upgraded to first  from Tampa or something.  I don't know if the...  This is just what someone told me.  They get upgraded to first class,  I guess they were frequent flyers.  And the airline,  for whatever reason,  didn't have the first class meals. 
[01:16:30]  Like, I guess they had forgotten  or somebody forgot  to put the thing on  or they put the wrong thing on  and they made them  buy the meals from the back.  Ugh.  What?  Continental is just a fucking...  Has become despicable.  They're terrible.  All these companies  are just shit.  Yeah, and they do cover it  under this blanket of,  well, it's policy.  We can't...  Like, no one can make  a decision anymore.  The person on the floor,  they hire people  where you can't just...  You know, you hired someone,  you trust them  to do their job.  How about they can make 
[01:17:00]  a decision every so often  and go, you know,  I kind of felt this out,  brought a little humanity  into the situation,  not just ones and zeros,  and we could do this.  I'll tell you what,  it's this thinking where  there's no winners or losers,  everybody's the same.  So if they make an exception  for one person,  then they have to make  the exception for everybody.  No, they don't.  No, you don't.  And you make ugly fucking  prom and bridesmaid dresses.  Yes.  You fucking...  Those dumb things  that they wear once 
[01:17:30]  get come all over.  They're made for a nickel  in some sweat house somewhere.  Yeah, some fucking Chinese...  Yeah.  A bunch of kids  are putting together  crepe paper  and cheap material.  I was on Continental,  and these kids  are coming from a school trip  or whatever.  Yay!  You know,  it's just a bunch of them.  Sure.  Maybe 16, 17.  All.  And there was a ton of them,  and they're walking,  and the flight attendant...  Frequent crier club.  The flight attendant...  Because they're getting molested. 
[01:18:00]  The flight attendant,  some black male,  first of all,  angry,  he should be,  he's a flight attendant  at probably 40.  Did he seem a little effeminate?  No, he was like,  everything else failed,  or I lost everything,  I have to do this type of gig.  So the kids are taking time  to get...  They don't fly all the time.  They don't know.  And he's yelling at them,  put your bags up,  do this, do this, yell.  And I said to him,  I go,  hey, maybe if you'd help him,  things would speed up  instead of yelling.  And he went,  motherfucker!  And he wanted to throw me 
[01:18:30]  off the plane.  He got mad.  He goes,  yeah, I'll get you thrown off.  Why?  For basing my opinion?  But that's the problem  with these fucking scumbag  flight attendants  is like,  they don't make  legitimate decisions  between a guy who's drunk  and a threat to the flight  and a problem  and a guy legitimately  criticizing them.  They've gotten so spoiled,  they think they're above  being criticized legitimately.  Criticizing a member  of the flight crew  in any way,  shape,  or form  is a terrorist act.  They'll fucking,  yeah,  zip strip your hands,  lay it in the aisle, 
[01:19:00]  and land the plane  at the closest airport.  I had it one time  where I was going to...  Maybe in downtown Utah,  like Rich said.  Downtown Utah.  Yeah.  Utah.  Really?  The state of Utah?  Did he say so?  Downtown Utah.  That's been coming in  like crazy.  I didn't catch that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was wondering  why you obsessed on that.  I'm like,  there's gotta be...  Downtown Utah.  Downtown New Jersey.  Yeah, yeah.  Downtown New Jersey. 
[01:19:30]  Wait, wait, whatever.  Downtown Schenectady.  Whatever you want  to throw your own things in.  Oh, Chip.  That would work.  See?  There was enough time  passed in that  that the Statue of Limitations  kicked in.  The Statue of Limitations,  of course.  We always remember that one  because it's up on the wall.  The Statue of Limitations.  The Statue of Limitations.  It's just a statue  of Voss's mental capacity.  Because it's limited.  It is.  You call.  Continental had me on hold  for 45 fucking minutes. 
[01:20:00]  And then,  I'm not lying,  then someone got on the phone  and I got cut off  another 40 minutes.  Oh, that is the worst.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's because you're the merger.  Oh, really?  Then hire more fucking people  to answer your phone.  When you have to go  through that automated shit  and then you get cut off,  and then you have to go  through it all over again.  You know you're never  going to get the same person.  So now you've got to go  through the whole bullshit  that you went through already.  I don't know how,  at least if I have  a bad experience with a company, 
[01:20:30]  I know that I can talk  about them on the radio  or I know I can Twitter  to 100,000 people.  It may not change.  Show off.  I'm not going to,  I'm not going to fucking  break the bank at Continental,  but I know it will cost them  a little bit of business  or whatever.  Some aggravation.  I don't know how regular,  like I should say,  people without those avenues  do it.  I understand why people  throw punches.  I understand why people  fucking attack employees.  They lose their fucking minds.  Of these companies  because they're just terrible  and they don't deal with you  with any humanity. 
[01:21:00]  Well, I don't know.  I don't know if you ever  dealt with a health insurance company.  Well, when we switched  our health insurance,  I had to bring it down.  It's like $20,000 a year.  So I sent two payments,  but they put them  on my old policy,  not the new one.  So I get a cancellation letter.  I go, well, I sent the payments.  They go, well, we put them  on your old policy.  So I go, well, you made the mistake,  not me.  So now I have to go fax some stuff, 
[01:21:30]  document stuff,  do all this shit  because of their incompetency,  if that's the right word.  It's not, of course.  They're incompetence.  They're incompetence.  They're incompetence.  See at the end.  All right.  But you can't,  because there's nobody.  Being in third grade.  Here's the thing.  There's nobody.  You made it that far?  There's nobody that cares  because they're not invested.  They're not invested.  Yeah, no one gives a shit.  They don't care.  So what are you going to do?  You're yelling,  you're screaming,  and you're getting nowhere.  That is the bottom line  is no one gives a fuck 
[01:22:00]  about like anything,  which, you know,  I guess I'm in the same boat.  No, but it's like  they deal with horrible customers  who demand more  than they should get,  but I'm not a horrible customer.  I don't yell,  you dropped your mic.  There goes,  I'm not unreasonable.  Like, I won't,  I was flying one time,  and again, I'm lucky.  Magic.  The Tonight Show will,  if I go out there,  they put me in first.  Again, I say that  because I don't want you  to think I'm showing off.  It's literally,  You're fancy.  No, but it's contractual.  It's like anybody, 
[01:22:30]  they fly out for a thing,  they put in.  Do you get miles for that  every time you fly?  Yeah, yeah, you do.  But I mean,  it's like,  it's whatever,  it's what they do  for everyone,  not just me.  So I was flying out one time  in Continental,  they ran out of the meal.  All right,  and I know this is  white people problems.  White people problems.  Here it comes.  But I literally,  I was like,  okay,  I'll just have like  something from the coach.  I didn't complain.  I wasn't mad.  I was like,  whatever,  you didn't have  what I wanted for breakfast.  I'll just buy one of the,  just give me one of the meals  from the back.  And just like that guy  from Tampa,  they made me pay for it.  They didn't have it.  They ran out of stuff  and they made me pay for it.  So I'm inclined to believe him. 
[01:23:00]  And I said to the woman,  I'm like,  you should be embarrassed.  Your airline stinks.  And then did she have you?  No,  we were in midair.  So when I fucking paid her  with the credit card,  she had a male flight attendant  standing with her.  Like,  there's going to be a problem.  I wouldn't even look at her.  I just,  I stuck it up like,  here,  take pig.  Call a waitress.  You should have said waitress.  Come here.  Call them waitress.  They stink.  Airline employees stink.  They do not like being called waitresses.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  In-flight waitress. 
[01:23:30]  A waitress.  Excuse me.  We're flight attendants  and we're trained in safety and stuff.  There is this attitude  that they are untouchable now.  You can't complain about the food,  the service,  anything that has nothing to do  with the safety issue,  interfering with the flight crew,  anything.  I mean,  you cannot do it  or else you will be perceived  as some type of threat  and they can always hold that  over your head  no matter what you've done.  It really is annoying  when they feel that 
[01:24:00]  any time you complain  about their fucking shit service  and if you complain legitimately  without screaming,  you're considered a threat  because they don't want to deal with you.  For him to say to Voss,  I'll have you throw off the plane,  hey, fuck you.  They were going to throw him  and Florentino off the plane  because Florentino was farting.  Yeah, the farts.  No, no, that wasn't me.  That is interfering with the flight crew.  That was him on Stuttering John.  Me and Florentino farted.  We both upgraded the first  going to L.A.,  I think for VH1 or something.  I don't remember what for.  And they were spritzing  the fucking, 
[01:24:30]  they were spritzing like  air freshener by our seats.  It just reeked  in the whole area.  It was fucking brutal.  I'm sorry to go off on a tangent.  And you guys are just laughing  your asses off.  The newspapers,  all the flight attendants saw  was this.  A shaking newspaper  of us howling.  You know what?  You just got to record yourself  complaining.  If you got a legitimate complaint  on an airline or anywhere  and you record it  and then when you get kicked off  or they stop,  you know, 
[01:25:00]  they land a plane  because you're out of hand  because you don't want to pay  and you're in first class,  which that's the whole reason  of sitting in first class.  You're paying that extra money  for food.  Well, I'm not.  But food's part of it, yeah.  Food's part of it  so you don't have to,  you know,  sneak in a fucking old sub  from the airport.  You can bring it in.  You don't have to sneak it in.  Yeah, I can actually bring it in.  You can just bring them on.  They don't care.  You'll have to bring food  on the plane.  Oh, fuck.  You know what I'm saying,  don't you, Mr. Particular? 
[01:25:30]  What, you said sneak in an old sub.  You know what I'm saying.  Submarine?  That'd be hard.  Subpar grinder.  That's what I shot yesterday.  Uh, yeah, the, uh, yeah,  the, the, the fly crew.  I, I, I try not to make any issues  even if they are being assholes  because I feel like, uh,  it's almost like a Seinfeld soup  Nazi thing.  I don't want to piss them off  because I, they must keep  the drinks coming.  So, if I'm the asshole,  then if I, boom, boom, 
[01:26:00]  I, I, I won't get service  and I, I need those Bloody Marys  to keep coming and coming.  You know how you fucking strike back,  you can't yell at them,  but I just, I absolutely dismiss them  in my dealing with them.  Like, I literally, uh, yes, no,  I don't look up at them.  I'll keep looking down at my food  on my iPad.  Oh, I'm a cunt.  That must fucking piss them off.  But it's only for fucking  when they're really rude or awful.  It's like, okay, then I'll treat you  like the fucking waitress 
[01:26:30]  or waiter you are.  Fetch.  The, uh, somebody had a,  oh, I guess that's gone.  The one that had,  it was Diane and Company.  What?  Um, somebody had a problem,  their daughter or something,  but, uh,  what's that one?  Knows about Diane and Company.  It's in his town.  I know this,  this probably amount to nothing,  but Adam?  Yes, I'm here.  You've had dealings  with that horrid dress company?  Yeah, you know what?  They're such scumbags 
[01:27:00]  that they were even lying  to the press  and claiming that they tried  to get their money  for the dress,  like, on Friday night,  but the kid didn't even die  in the car crash  until after they claimed  that they were trying  to get their money.  Oh, wait a minute, though,  but hold on.  Was she trying to get  the money from the dress  back before he died?  Like, maybe they broke up?  No.  Okay.  No, that's what they were claiming,  just to try to make themselves look.  Oh, that's what Diane and Company  was claiming.  Diane and Company was lying, 
[01:27:30]  just to try to make,  save face.  Wait, are they saying,  are they saying that the girl  wanted the money back  and was using the tragedy  to get the money back?  Yeah, they were, like,  insulted that they thought  it was so quick.  Like, how could she come in  right away  to get the money back?  But it's because the girl  just wanted to help the family  pay for the funeral.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  They're even bigger scumbags there  because this dress  was, like,  bought off the rack.  They didn't have to special order it. 
[01:28:00]  She didn't have it, like, fitted.  So, like,  just put it back  on the frickin' rack,  you know?  And $1,200 fucking dollars  for a prom dress?  Oh, that is a fucking rip-off,  whatever it is.  All right, thanks, Adam.  Go to Billy, because he's got  Billy, Billy.  He's got, like,  a similar story about this.  Billy!  What's up, guys?  How you doing, man?  Good.  All right.  Yeah, just,  Adam said that the girl  tried to get a refund  before the kid died.  But you know what?  The kid died,  and this girl's all 
[01:28:30]  throwing herself up on the news,  like, not even a week later.  Something a little fishy  about that, don't you think?  No, a week later  isn't enough time.  Like, she might have went  a couple of days later.  I think it makes sense  because she probably,  you know,  spoke to the family,  knew that they couldn't afford it,  and she's like,  oh, I could take  this prom dress back.  I don't need it.  Plus, the funeral's gonna be...  You seem like a real twat  on TV, though.  I have to say...  Well, her boyfriend died.  I mean,  she was dating a guy  for two years.  It was like it was  a one-month relationship.  And she's a high school girl, too,  so, I mean,  that's, you know...  Yeah, how does she seem 
[01:29:00]  like a twat?  All high school girls are.  You have to say...  Believe me.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thank you, Billy.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  It's just...  You can't...  I get more pissed off  every day  because you just can't  get the shit  that you're willing  to pay for,  that you have paid for.  Nothing works.  Just blatant incompetence  everywhere.  Oh, sitting right there.  I bought a fucking iPad  for $500, 
[01:29:30]  and the guy bought it from...  Yeah, but you put it  over your face.  But the guy...  Chip.  Sorry, Rich.  Nothing.  It wasn't a good one.  Yeah.  iPad, $500.  Yeah.  What happened?  I called a guy  for technical support,  and he's mean to me.  Well, it's pretty  self-explanatory.  Yeah.  What did you do wrong?  I'd be mean, too.  I don't know.  I don't think he was mean to you.  Are you joking about  Danny's bit that he did  about you?  No, I was talking about  Bobby being my  technical support guy.  That's who I brought it from.  Oh, oh, Bobby. 
[01:30:00]  Why, what bit did Danny do?  Was Bobby mean to you  when he was just yelling at you?  The first time I called him,  he was mean, like he's  Mr. Fucking Computer.  All right?  I can't wait till he calls me  for health tips.  Fucking Colin had Bobby pay  because I guess he said  Bobby's a tech bully.  He teaches you things  as a bully.  A tech bully.  And Bobby and Colin  were together,  and Colin didn't know  how to work his computer  or something.  And Bobby goes,  Who am I?  Who am I?  And Colin goes, 
[01:30:30]  You're your stepfather  and I'm you  when you're seven.  I'm like, yeah,  that's probably exactly  what happened.  Bob is a fucking bully.  What was Bob's line?  He tweeted that  about black chicks.  I'll have to find it  to get it verbatim,  but he said something like,  Black women shouldn't wear  deodorant on a hot day  because it looks like  their armpits are eating  ice cream. 
[01:31:00]  Fucking funny.  Bobby,  he sent me a video yesterday  where he's just,  did you see that one?  Where he's just home alone  and there's this lonely  song playing  and it's about being alone  and he's eating stuff  and then he just,  he hangs himself  at the end of the video.  It's really twisted.  What is it?  It's Bobby  doing this real sick  kind of looking 
[01:31:30]  all alone at his house  but he's smiling  and he's eating.  He's just eating  and going through  his boring life  and this really  like kind of morbid  lonely song  is playing in the background.  System of a down.  Yeah.  And then at the end  he's like got a rope  around his neck  from the blinds  and he just hangs himself.  It's so fucking morbid.  His wife's at the big  and tall shop  trying to return  all of his clothes. 
[01:32:00]  At the supermarket  trying to return the food.  12 briskets  trying to have  floorboards  strengthening equipment  removed from the house  with the hydraulics.  I get it dude  because I'm fat.  I got it.  Got it dude.  I told you  I had one more fat in me.  He's in Tampa now.  He's coming home today.  I kind of miss Bob.  Yeah.  I haven't seen him in a while.  Never thought I'd say that  or think it.  Bobby's a good egg. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  He's kind of a creep.  He's a dinosaur egg.  I was watching that  god awful  Billboard Music Awards  last night  and you know  how award shows  and shit  everybody just kind of  gets on Twitter  and you start going  back and forth with shit.  I didn't feel that vibe  was going on  with that award show  last night.  I didn't even know  it was happening.  I know.  I tried to jump in  like I think I tuned in  maybe 45 minutes  before it ended 
[01:33:00]  and I tweeted a few things  and realized  people were actually  tweeting back  what are you talking about?  You think they were  like oh okay  no one's watching this  I'm not even going to bother.  You would think  they would advertise  at least on one billboard  around town.  Ooh.  Ooh.  It's Monday morning.  I'm worried  not a lot to plug.  You're lucky I'm here.  Well billboard music awards  is owned by  I guess  Dick Clark  Productions  and Dick Clark  is you know 
[01:33:30]  ABC guy  so I guess  and ABC  just used this whole thing  every time  they went to break  it was just promos  for all their  fucking TV shows.  It was barely  a commercial  it was you know  every fucking TV show  was being promoted  and  the big  the big moments  Britney Spears  came out  and she sang with  who the fuck  she sang with?  Rihanna.  Beyonce  and then later on  she came out  with someone  I could give a shit 
[01:34:00]  who it was  that big ass bitch  Rihanna  she came out with right?  Nicki Minaj  No no  Nicki Minaj  the big ass  Nicki Minaj  is fucking like  there's something  bizarre  going on there  cause her body  the whole body  looks like a normal  person's body  with a  the biggest  fucking ass  ever  on a person  of  especially of that  stature  I heard she's a bitch too  I had a driver  that had driven her 
[01:34:30]  she said she was a  fucking nightmare  and almost threw her  in the car  figures  let me see Sam  this is an older  picture of her  that doesn't do it justice  last night she came out  they say that  it's not real  oh they think it's  implants?  yeah  she's like ass implants?  you can see right  it does look fake  like there are pictures  of her ass  where it looks fake  like it looks like  there's just too much  ass there for  for ways  it doesn't go from  waist to ass right  she not rolls  she not rolls  for a while  she was standing in front of  that's just  nonsense 
[01:35:00]  the rappers always  need new cars  straight down I think  yeah that one  it's like  that makes no sense  whoa  look  I think she  she had ass implants  that looks like  ass implants  why would she do that  she wanted  she wanted to have a big booty  she's trying to  she's trying to attract guys  that like that  ass implants are fucking awful  I've felt a few  they're terrible  you can get ass implants  yes  hold on  let me call Bonnie  she wants to  implant one 
[01:35:30]  and play her husband  the biggest injustice  in the museum  is when this girl  Haley got kicked off  of Idol last week  you don't watch it  this girl  now teenage girl  I didn't  this fucking girl  man let me tell you  she belted out  Led Zeppelin  she was fucking  off the fucking hook  I'm telling you  who could sing  Led Zeppelin  am I the only one  I can't even look at her  she was off the fucking hook  off the charts baby  oh god  Hallie 
[01:36:00]  she's my favorite  did you cut her rug  while you were listening to her  let me tell you something  23 skidoo  when she got kicked off  I broke camp  oh god  that's before your time son  before my time  when we used to leave a place  we'd go let's break camp  that's a cool thing to say  back in the 70s  in the nom  in the 70s  when we were leaving  in Auschwitz  oh god  the uh 
[01:36:30]  so Britney Spears  came out and sang  sang  with them  it was one of these  20 second deals  where she just pops out  at the end of a song  and does this  she came out  and you would think  for this many years  of lip syncing  she would get it down  it was so bad  that  I don't know  how she wasn't  completely embarrassed  to walk out  on that stage  and boy  those  stump like  legs  she was wearing 
[01:37:00]  a black dress  she didn't look  as bad as she has  looked in the past  but not nearly  as good as she has  either  why can't they  just fucking sing  yeah just sing  how come none of these  shit performers  can sing live  that was a lip sync  fest last night  they were all like  lip syncing  and then  Lil Wayne came out  with  Mary Jane Blige  Mary Jane Blige  I don't listen  to her shit  she's ancient  too  is she old  yeah she's a queen  yeah she's a queen 
[01:37:30]  Mary Jane Blige  how long is this  commercial that you  have to sit through  30 seconds  and they just had  to keep  daily motion  is fucking terrible  that website  they stink  I was fucking  trying to watch  something on there  the other day  and I had tried  to fast forward  through it  and a new  commercial started  I just closed it  and went somewhere else  and now she's  doing this whole  thing with  there's a bunch  of other chicks  and then  what is this  and then a chicken  comes out  a guy in a chicken 
[01:38:00]  suit comes out  they give me an  eye she's crazy  what is this about  she's gonna fry it  like what is this  there's a chicken  suit guy  can you fast forward  through it Tim  you betcha  look at her ass  it's retarded  and now  wait till  Britney comes out  there's a bunch  of chicks  in jail outfits  they were just 
[01:38:30]  like giving  lap dances  to a bunch  of black guys  they brought  out on the stage  that's her bitch  what  that's her bitch  she does it  in concert  oh it is  that's saucy  look at her  now they gotta  they keep blanking  out all the  nasty language  sure  because god forbid  we see it  I was more offended  by the white chicks  giving the black guys  lap dances  what's up with that  they showed that  I'd rather hear  you know  nasty language 
[01:39:00]  and now look  big Britney  appearance  look how bad  the lip syncing is  fucking stinks  not for you people  at home  just trust us  it's bad  all fucking  what's that thing  they do  auto-tuned  she's trying to  like  terrible  not even close  there's no energy  so you can tell  she's not doing it  loudly  no  look at her  and she's got  stumpy legs now  but it's like  who cares about  these two being  together  nobody  the kids 
[01:39:30]  they had a fake  audience too  close to the stage  they like put  the beautiful  people there  so they could  make it like  wow we're partying  and having a great  time listening  and they're hired  and they had this  bitch singing  lip syncing  in auto  to music  and that's it  awful  and that's all  she does  all she does  I guess if you  listen to it on the  radio it's fine  but why would  anybody watch a  live award show  there's no reason  to  nothing's gonna  happen  some manufactured  moment of  craziness  Britney kissed 
[01:40:00]  Rihanna  who gives a fuck  I've watched people  having their mouths  shit in  from under the  table  and then  Neil Diamond  came out  because they gave  him an icon  did he lip sync  too  no he sang  but it would  have been better  if he lip  synced  because his  songs  except for  maybe the  chorus  have become  unrecognizable  he's like  you know  singing sweet  Caroline  and the  beginning  he's just  I guess he's  so sick 
[01:40:30]  of fucking  singing it  that he just  pretty much  changed the  entire way  he sings  the beginning  that's why  he told  the  how about  the microphone  that's why  he told  the history  of the song  that he wrote  it for  Caroline Kennedy  when she was  like three  so he wouldn't  have to sing  it again  because I  thought he  was a real  creep after  that  did he say  that or is  that a legend  or myth  he said that  he did  that's kind  of funny  give him that  but it was  yeah he sang  sweet Caroline  and America 
[01:41:00]  you know  they're coming  to America  but he sang  it at least  yeah yeah  but when he sang  America  they just paraded  on behind him  it was  like  25 black  people  and maybe  two white  people  it was all  Mexican  oh yeah  I can't begin  to know it  I can't begin  to know it  he's just  talking  his dancing  is terrible  it doesn't 
[01:41:30]  even sound  like the  song  is his  you know  what's funny  he's singing  at least  he's singing  spring became  the summer  well he's old  school  he's tired  he couldn't  find an old  album  but I just  love the fact  that this old  fucking guy  is doing a  terrible dance  and he's alive  it is an awful  dance  and look at the  people clapping  behind him  they don't give  a shit  they don't know  who the fuck  he is 
[01:42:00]  because they're  all hired  everyone's heard  this song  this song  oh he's great  there he goes  still sounds good  oh yeah  well the chorus  he gets it  did you see  Beyonce  no I didn't  catch the Beyonce  no what did  she lip sync  oh that was  Jeff Rouros  oh that's the guy  that was just in  that was fucking  Eric Stonestreet  oh I knew  he looked familiar  I was looking 
[01:42:30]  at that guy  going that guy  looks familiar  oh he was  sitting next to  me  this is great  I don't like  when he does  that  I don't either  that he don't  seem so long  with only two  just sing it  the way you  fucking did  on the album  look at all  excited  he's just an  old fucking  man walking  down the aisle  not auto-tuning  like these  fucking twats  he really is  good for you  Neil  these fucking  twats all  auto-tuning 
[01:43:00]  and lip-syncing  boo  all right  let's see  how Beyonce  what did she  do  she had  performances  god damn it  I was enjoying  that  get it for  your  do you have  it for your  iTunes  I don't have  it on my  did you get  iTunes  downloaded on  your fucking  phone  was she  singing or  lip-syncing  oh boy  I think there  were a few  parts where  she was actually  singing but not  for the most  why wouldn't  she  why would  she  what is  this 
[01:43:30]  she was on  idle  oh there's  so self  this empowered  yeah Neil  Diamond just  walked out  oh really  shut up  spread your  legs  boom  oh look at  this horse  shit  look at  that  she's dancing  with her  own  silhouettes  yeah a  revolution 
[01:44:00]  meanwhile she  just shows  her ass  and is  that is  that the  revolution  that guys  think chicks  are hot  yeah wow  what a revolution  that is  all this nonsense  and she can't  even sing her  own shit  live  yeah  great empowerment  she's uh  and I really  sound like an  old man  I know it  sure people  want to  strangle me  today  I apologize  company's  fair  what happened  to good old  Neil Diamond  I'm embarrassing  myself  this is awful  what did she say 
[01:44:30]  fucker  here we go  oh this mother  she's doing the  charleston I think  this is fucking  she's at the  cotton club  I don't like this  this is awful  oh everything is  so generic  I know  it's all this  generic sounding  techno  crap  look it's a  Beyonce army  look out  we're in trouble  now  this is  unlistenable 
[01:45:00]  and unwatchable  what is this  now coming in  a rapist  I'll take  fucking stupid  Neil Diamond  snapping in his  awful black  coat  than this  please  pay me  you should only  hear this if  you're being  cooked in a  big black pot  I'm waiting for  Charlton Heston  to walk up  this is just  terrible 
[01:45:30]  this is awful  and first of all  this couldn't have  been a performance  this is a video  that she's live  in front of the  video screen  okay yeah I'm sure  she is  it's great  it's very well  choreographed  oh my god  I just don't like  this song  right that  Monty hates it  I've never  heard it  woman  yeah  y'all ready  are you ready  no  yeah there's 
[01:46:00]  her empowerment  just shake your  fucking ass  and spread your  legs and show  your pussy  there yeah  woman empowerment  oh god do I  hate this shit  all right I've  had it  I'm tapping  is she really  singing there or  no I don't know  I've only watched  that line sorry  I don't know  I don't know why 
[01:46:30]  that bugs me so  much when they  lip sync I  shouldn't care but  I do yeah well  I guess I like  live music and I  like when they make  mistakes I like  when they trip on  fucking it's a it  kind of just  symbolizes to me  what's wrong with  like people just  can't accept it  in perfection they  can't accept that  it might not be  perfect yeah like on  the album which is  why comedy sucks  because they have  to fucking sweeten  it with laughs  they can't they  can't people just  can't accept the  fact that a joke  might bomb or a  laugh might not be  what you want or a  moment might not be  what you want to  fix it record your  act and then just  lip sync it so it's 
[01:47:00]  perfect comments can't  do that and by the  way we also can't go  on TV and just do  our jokes as is and  have them fucking  conveniently just  beep out our  mouths yeah because  these fucking faggot  pussy singers can't  change their lyrics and  they're fucking they  get away with  everything yeah I  guess Eminem's gonna  say fuck 50 times  we'll just have to  go on a delay so we  can beep it that's  what they did with  Lil Wayne too  weezy Lil  weezy yeah weezy  weezy what the fuck  is that I'm annoying  myself by the way if  I'm annoying everybody  I'm annoying myself  what's with the  weezy thing it's just  bugging me I'm tired  yeah what do you 
[01:47:30]  mean what's with  Sam what's with the  weezy thing what's  it like why is that  his name yeah cuz  Wayne weezy Lil  Wayne his name is  Wayne so it goes to  weezy his nickname  weezy you know  what you need you do  need to go to an  empty chair am I  right  go to Utah work  there because it's  serene you need a  place like that where  there's beautiful  mountains around  somewhere you can  relax downtown Utah  downtown Utah right  and and just go there  the owner you'll love  the club you know  who I really want is 
[01:48:00]  really pushing it you  know I really guy just  text me saying he's not  mad at me okay you know  I really want to see  these things you know  I really want to see on  this show it would be  great someone came out  and saying you light up  my life and then  mocked fucking putting  a bag over their  head greatest story of  the decade that is a  fantastic story he was a  bad boy what a naughty  naughty boy the guy that  that wrote the song of the  70s probably the biggest  song ever you light up my 
[01:48:30]  life Debbie Boone singing it  here what a huge song  this was carry on light up  my day feel my night with  song I'm fucking good  you got a good voice I  know  why are you not singing  oh is he a fucking bad boy 
[01:49:00]  I forget his name oh  Joseph Brooks yes he had  82 allegations of sexual 
[01:49:30]  assault I like my sweaty  balls I'm gonna fuck you  in the mouth he would  invite starlets over and  drug and rape them really  yeah he was 73 he's all  living off that one song  you will be molested he was  molesting 13 women who were  lured to his apartment for  supposed acting auditions  penis you are never to blame  nice it was a hauntingly a 
[01:50:00]  beautiful song and his son's a  piece of shit too he's in jail  oh yeah he's on trial for  attempting for murder right  yep no he murdered his he  actually murdered his chick you  can get a doggy style you can  get laying on your side those are  your only choices this is my  house and I get to sing  you ever slept a guy's cock  I don't know what that one is  yeah 
[01:50:30]  god damn rich cunt I kill rich  cunt  when it feels so right  cause you  she was very badly raped you  see  good evening  yeah 
[01:51:00]  how did this guy kill himself  it's like uh not your  ordinary  run of the mill  uh killing  I'll tell you the mask  he uh his head was  encased in a dry cleaning bag  that had a tube attached to a  helium gas tank  and a towel was wrapped around  his head and neck  oh my god  it was fucking like  MacGyver killed him  that must have been hysterical  though it's like  oh my god I'm dying  I  I can't believe it  I can't breathe  why the helium  uh because it's not oxygen 
[01:51:30]  he probably didn't want to  not be able to breathe  anything in  like if I think if you put a  bag over your head  you just suffocate because  like  how do people do that  you can't breathe  right  but with helium  you'll be breathing  but your blood's getting no  oxygen so you just kind of  pass out I guess  he must have studied that  online or something  he was very gone  oh he looks fucking  like a guy that  is facing 11  counts of fucking  no 82  or 82  13 women 
[01:52:00]  his daughter was a fucking  his daughter really uh  hated him too  like she was  she was 78  not quite a  not quite a uh  great dad  great father figure  so good  that's great  that's what has shit happen  now that we don't  we don't have to put him on trial  we save Bonnie  and he's dead  yeah how perfect  he's dead  and then it's yeah  the son is a scumbag too  he murdered his fucking  I don't know he murdered  he's facing charge  I know he did it  I think I uh  yeah well he's in jail  yeah he probably did it  I'm just gonna go and say  he did it  I don't like that innocent 
[01:52:30]  until proven guilty thing  because if I hear enough  I know they did it anyway  whenever I watch that  first 48  and you see the uh  perp they bring him in  and they pretty much  get a confession  and all the evidence  points to him  and then they go uh  at the end  they put the thing  yeah he's in jail  awaiting trial  he's innocent  until proven guilty  I'm like no he's not  I know he did something  track record  eh past performance  that's what track record means  that's right  exactly  it's a track record  I thought that was a good 
[01:53:00]  record by a group  called The Tracks  no Chip  my god  I had such  ridiculously racist  horrible dreams  last night  were they daydreams  just laying awake  looking at the ceiling  hands behind your head  feet crossed  just dreaming of  lynching people  to fucking  smoking a pipe  and whittling  yeah  hauling out to the fields  yeah  just thinking about  making your own  strange fruit 
[01:53:30]  oh my god  no it  it was really  no it's a dream  so you know  I don't know  what they mean  everyone tries to  interpret dreams  we'll figure them out  very quickly  well I'm sure you will  but it's  it's like  it's really fucked up  really fucked up  but now I must say  also again  please let me reiterate  this is a dream  and I know it sounds  very racist  but I can't control  what the fuck  happens in my dreams 
[01:54:00]  so here's  here it goes  okay  first  I don't know what happened  but  I was hanging out  a big room  and  and there was  a woman in there  and a big  chimpanzee  I swear  it was like  a big chimpanzee  that was going around  and a couple other people  in the room  were like  all cool  with the chimpanzee  and all I'm thinking is  these things  fucking  rip your balls off  and bite your face  and shit like that  and I didn't want to  look at them 
[01:54:30]  or show fear  but I was afraid  and the thing  like sensed the fear  in me  and starts coming over  and like  like fucking with me  right  and  who was the girl  she white girl  or black girl  it was a white girl  did you like her  I didn't know her  okay  was she coming from school  or was it a summer vacation  I have no idea  what that  I'm not going to let you  elaborate  and make this worse  than it comes off  being a dream  okay so  some people were cool  with the chimpanzee  but you were afraid of it  I didn't like the chimpanzee  because I've seen  and this has nothing 
[01:55:00]  to do with anything else  but the fact that  I know the chimpanzees  are very vicious  when they attack  and things like that  so  but it was supposed  to be cool  but I was kind of being  you know  very fearful  of this chimpanzee  then  I don't know  how this  turned around  to something  but  two guys  were in  the room  and they were  blowing the chimpanzee  wait 
[01:55:30]  two guys  two guys  are in the room  blowing the chimpanzee  how's that racist  it wasn't me  no it gets  wait  who were the guys  I don't know  and what was the chimpanzee doing  the chimpanzee was  getting a blowjob  and I guess  enjoying it  was he a crack dealer  and one of the guys  was like  cause I was looking over  like what the fuck  is going on  and the guy  looked over  and he's like  talking about  how you gotta  grab the chimpanzee's 
[01:56:00]  dick  and it was  really bad  so what are you  saying oh no for  keep going with the dream  go ahead  what do you have  so far Jimmy  the chimpanzee  is your racist  mind  putting a black man  as a chimpanzee  really  why would I do that  it's just  because it's an irrational  fear of black people  that you have  and I think that's what it is  and yet other people  in the room  aren't afraid of him  so you see how  we all interact  with black guys  and not afraid  but you have this  irrational anger  which I think 
[01:56:30]  is fear based  but deep down  it's because you  want to suck  their big dicks  oh my god  is that scary  you just told my story  see that  I know  isn't  the gist  of this dream  no but the fear part  I believe  I'm kidding  well that could be  that could be  the way I've  interpreted it  into a dream  I don't know  with a blowing  I actually wouldn't  have went there  but you said  it was racist  so I'm assuming  it had something  well later on  in the dream  like okay 
[01:57:00]  that happened  and that was  all weird and shit  and then you know  how dreams are  then I'm in  some department store  and for some reason  were you Woolworths  and Woolco  yes I was in  a department store  it had elevators  and  hope it wasn't  a Sears in Florida  in 1981  alright guys  just for you  I was buying  a department  ooh  ooh  yes I was in  the department store  and there was 
[01:57:30]  an elevator  so I was on  one of the top floors  and this woman  this older woman  was trying to get  something  from one of the shelves  that she wanted  to purchase  I gather  and she couldn't  do it  because something  was in the way  and I could have  helped her out  but I had to get  this giant bowl  from the top shelf  and take that out  because I had to  get a bowl  for some reason  so I grabbed the bowl  and I just walked out  and she goes  can't help me huh  and I go  I'm in a rush 
[01:58:00]  and went to the elevators  to get downstairs  so  by the way  another gay thing  grabbing a bowl  no bowl  a big bowl  of course  you had to reach up  and grab a bowl  you were molested  by somebody of color  you were forced  to suck a dick of color  in the tree house  how does that come into  no  no you had to reach up  and grab a bowl  it might have been  a Mexican guy  from the farm  that you hung out on  or whatever  what is a bowl  what does the bowl represent  you're reaching up  grabbing a ball  it's a word thing  dreams do that word shit  so instead 
[01:58:30]  I'm reaching up  to a giant sack  ball  with balls in them  yes  why can't you help me  that's probably  what you were saying  that's probably  what your mind was going  why can't you help me  no one was helping you  no one was helping me  big dark dick  in your young white mouth  I do remember though  it was a white bowl  because it was a white porcelain  big  like  I have a soup bowl  in my house  that is very similar  one of the big white  soup bowls  but it was bigger than that  okay  it was like a big white bowl 
[01:59:00]  except in your house  a statue is holding it  yes of course  on the fucking front yard  okay  so  so  so I  I bring  what was the woman  trying to get  I don't know  what she was trying to get  but it was  it was  something that was stuck  on a shelf  and she was kind of  backed in a corner  like she  she was stuck  in there too  kind of  as she's trying  to get this thing out  it was very awkward  and I  I could have helped her  very easily get  whatever she needed  off the shelf  because it wasn't  high up or anything 
[01:59:30]  but instead  I inconvenienced her  more by opening the door  to leave that room  that this merchandise  was in  she represents your mom  who didn't help you  when you were young  or he didn't help  he always helped me  or he maybe  not when you were  getting mouth raped  no I've never gotten  mouth raped  I assure you  Anthony's thing is  he's he's got  arms and guns  maybe you're afraid  that you won't be able  to protect a girl  that you're with  and a girl is going  to be injured  or taken away  from you  she was an older woman  it was an old woman  and I looked at her  like get the fuck 
[02:00:00]  why can't you help me  like I don't want  to help her  with anything  so you're thinking  it's me  that needs to help  instead of  I don't know  I thought it might  be the girl  she's trapped  in a corner  trying to read something  and she's saying  why can't  why don't you help me  so you're kind of  just leaving her  without help  you're leaving her  without being helped  but if she was younger  I would say  maybe it's a fear  but if she's an old lady  I don't know  what that means  yeah  I don't know  well I go downstairs  with the bowl  in the elevator  now by the time 
[02:00:30]  I walk out  of the department store  of course you go down  of course you go down  oh I'm going down  of course  oh shit  big bowl  in the elevator  you go down  I got it  shaft  elevator shaft  I didn't even think of that  what happened  like the shining  but it was milk  coming out  in your face  in the elevator  did somebody have  on a fucking dog  or bunny rabbit outfit  you fucking moe  alright guys  so I go downstairs  and there's a department store 
[02:01:00]  but I don't pay  for the bowl  but nobody  gives me a problem  but I can't even see  cash registers  or anything  and I just  I leave  and I'm out now  in the parking lot  and it's night time  right  and now instead  of the bowl  for some reason  I have  a pizza  and it's not  in a box  it's just  the pie  of course it's not  because that would be  a vagina  why would it be  it's not 
[02:01:30]  in a box  the pizza  is like  under my arm  like you would hold  a stack of books  like that  like not  not flat either  like it's  under my arm  laying there  like where the cheese  will all drip off  but it's not  there's a little grease  dripping off of it  but  and  and in the other hand  I think I might have  the bowl  or something  and I'm walking  and now  I notice  that I'm being  flanked by two  gentlemen of color  and they look  a little gangsta 
[02:02:00]  so  and then it hits me  I'm like  holy shit  these are the two guys  that  like threatened me  if I didn't have  like money for them  or something  tomorrow  they were gonna  fuck me up  you know  so I'm  now I've got  this dumb pizza  in a bowl  I don't have a gun  with me or anything  so  the black guy  comes up  and like  goes you know  I'm gonna  smack you  in your fucking head  and then he  bashes me in the head  and I was like 
[02:02:30]  ow that  you know  that fucking  hurting shit  and then he's like  where's my shit  and he was getting  all fucking  in my face  and pissed off  and  took the pizza  took the bowl  probably want the pizza  after it's been  against your fucking shirt  I don't know  probably has your  shirt cookies in it  shirt cookies  it's been dripping  half the pizza  it looks like your pizza  had a stroke  cause this fucking  cheese is all on one side  stroke pizza  and then  and then  it  it got really weird  where  where  he  touched my leg 
[02:03:00]  of course he did  he touched my leg  and I was  and then I started thinking  holy shit  this motherfucker  is gonna try something  so I got up  and tried to run  and you know how  running goes in dreams  it doesn't work  so I'm like  ah ah  and then he  like punched me  in the head  and the other guy  like  like  grabbed me too  and  and  started like  kicking my ass  and I woke up  but there was no  there was no sexual  well  the whole thing  of it being  going from the chimp  to the 
[02:03:30]  the that  and then the  the gangsters  the chimp could just  honestly represent  aggressive males  like there are other people  comfortable with them  and you're uncomfortable  with certain aggressive males  that's why you gotta  protect yourself  yeah  I think it's all about protection  and you're afraid  that you'll be walking  through a parking lot  and someone will try to rob you  and all you'll have  is some motherfucking pizza  and a bowl  pizza and a dumb bowl  I don't know what the bowl means  somebody might have  bowl might represent something  I don't know what it is  but  yeah I would love to  somebody out there  may have an interesting  interpretation of that  which we'll never know  if it's real or not  now I  now I realize  how you guys cover 
[02:04:00]  like 20 hours of radio  a week  with a fucking  two hour  dumb dream story  and this guy  who thinks  he's a fucking doctor  well that's what we do  but I'm realizing  I don't know what I'm  I recognize that  you try to analyze  these things  I would like to analyze  one of your dreams  what was it  there was an apple  and somebody fed it to me  with their fucking palm  flattened  I don't even have  big teeth anymore  well  alright  no need to be literal  but I  I always have dreams  that I can't  that no matter  what happens  if I have a firearm 
[02:04:30]  and I need to use it  it never works  cops have that dream  never fucking works  I googled some dream meetings  now I know that  you know  there's only so much  legitimacy that you  could really put in  because I'm sure  like every site  says something different  for each object  but this one  says  if you see a bowl  in your dream  it symbolizes the womb  and sense of security  consider  the condition of the bowl  and how it is treated  or handled  in the dream  this may offer clues  as to how you feel  you are being treated  in a particular relationship 
[02:05:00]  alright alright  the bowl was very  pristine  it was brand new  off the shelf  very very white  maybe that's how you like  you know what  maybe that's the thing  about the way  you look at women  oh I like them  pristine  and nice  and white  and white  and white  and unbroken  smooth and unbroken  and new  and you're afraid  yeah  okay  yeah  so that girl  that represents the woman  that represents the girl  and you're afraid  she's gonna be hurt  by fucking people  and I shunned  the old lady  yes 
[02:05:30]  I took that  because  I shunned  the old lady  in exchange  for the nice  new  white bowl  could be about  your ex-marriage  or something  with the mother  or the marriage  I think it's just  that I don't like  old broads  nah that means  something  I think you're  an alcoholic  alright  I don't have to  dream to  that's when I  pass out  when I fucking  hallucinate  but that makes  perfect sense  that you're  fucking carrying  the ball  and the guys  are gonna hurt  you  and you know  you're carrying  this ball  black guys though  are you afraid  of black guys  it's always 
[02:06:00]  black guys  in my dreams  like always  like if there's  a problem  either that  or it's like  some kind of  military thing  going on  like some kind  of thing  happening  but again  the gun  never works  they don't have  the right bullets  for the gun  it sucks  you shoot  and it goes like  nothing happens  you want some more  symbols out of your dream  help me out  it says here that  to see or eat pizza  in your dream  represents abundance  choices and variety  it may also indicate  that you are lacking 
[02:06:30]  or feeling deprived  of something  alternatively  a pizza may have  similar significance  to a circle  a bowl is circular  bowl  and so is pizza  pizza  you want to do  the chimp  to see a chimpanzee  in your dream  suggests that  what you thought  was true  is actually not  you are overthinking  an issue  I don't know about that  I believe that's  more regression  how do they pull  that out of their ass  I don't believe that  and who comes up  with these  you know  that's just  anybody's opinion 
[02:07:00]  oh you see  a chimp in your dream  that means  that you want to  go to a double feature  yeah it means  by the way  that's how old you are  I know  that you improv  a double feature  when was the last time  there was a double feature  that's what a dream means  that you want to go  see a talkie  a talkie  a double feature  you want to go  to the drive-in  oh it's great  we see cartoons first  then there's a newsreel  a double feature 
[02:07:30]  oh fuck  but who decides  what it means  yeah a chimp  shouldn't mean  that  it shouldn't be  so abstract  dreams  I don't  that's why  I don't like  how abstract they are  because then they can  be interpreted  into anything  how about  I just was fucking  like  my synapses  in my head  were just  clicking together  things that don't  make fucking sense  and that happens  I live that all the time  yeah well  in a waking state  yes  I have a lot  of these weird dreams 
[02:08:00]  that just  sometimes they're  in the same  location  like there's a house  that I've been to  in a thousand dreams  and the same thing  happens in the house  same little passageways  and stuff  it's just really weird  we have an armchair  psychologist  Rick  in Austin  Texas  Rick  how are you  what's up  you have  absolutely no  experience in this  right  none whatsoever 
[02:08:30]  all right  hold on for two seconds  because we have a doctor  on the phone  that's what I want  to get to  all right  yes  Dr. Chipperson  wait  if the guy's  an armchair  psychologist  does that mean  that he helps  armchairs  to feel  in blue  or something  wait wait wait  maybe the armchair  doesn't know  what he's sitting  on  enough about  the armchair  I want to know  about my dream  with the bowl  the pizza  you're probably  afraid of something 
[02:09:00]  that if you had  a bowl of pizza  that you wouldn't  have nowhere  to carry it  or something  you know  or maybe  you was  afraid  that your bowl  would fall down  or something  like you was  on a shelf  and there's the bowl  and you're like  hey where's the bowl  everybody's like  go bowling for dollars  I don't know  what about the chimpanzee  what's that  what about the chimpanzee  in my dream  I had a  you're probably afraid  that your pan  is going to have  a bunch of  antsy in it  or something  oh no  oh my god  he did not 
[02:09:30]  he did not even  you probably was  getting like  a pan of antsy  or something  all right  you know  wait wait wait  where did you go  to medical school  by the way  Dr. Chipperson  what's that  yeah  where did you go  to medical  I heard you  I just  I went to  to Jerry Hopkins  Jerry Hopkins  that means something 
[02:10:00]  that you was  in a store  or something  oh right  yeah  because I was  in a department  store  and maybe  the ball  symbolizes  the one  that your father  threw against the wall  because of the spaghetti  incident  and you was mad  because your mother  was going  why don't you help me  so maybe you was  really scared  that you couldn't  help your mother  when your father  was throwing a ball  up against the thing  and the pizza  kind of represents  the same kind of food  well that is very  intuitive of Chip  I didn't think  you could actually  I wanted to go  to tour  but I couldn't  get in  so I was at it  doing it  I'm trying to think 
[02:10:30]  if there was  one more thing  in the dream  oh the black guys  what does that represent  black eyes  yeah black eyes  you're probably afraid  of being beaten up  you're getting black eyes  no no  it wasn't eyes  it was two black gentlemen  I know  but sometimes  the dreams work  like I used to dream  that sometimes  I would see black guys too  and they'd be on top  of my mother  and they'd be giving it 
[02:11:00]  to her  and she'd be yelling  fuck me  and she'd be yelling  stick that black dick  fodder in  and I'd be in the bushes  and I'd be watching  through the bushes  or something  and I'd be crying  but then I would notice  that there was  a whole big puddle  in front of my pants  and what do you think  that represented  that my mother  fucked black guys  and I'd be in my pants  so there's no real  abstract thought  going on there  what's that  you heard me  no I didn't  I don't know  what abstract means  oh I didn't think so 
[02:11:30]  that's kind of like  being distracted  but your abs  that's what you're  that's what your abs  are distracted  abstract  it's a laugh  it's hard  no  I was  I was trying to say  like  your dream  doesn't necessarily  have to mean  exactly what it means  that your mother  is fucking black guys  and you came in your pants  oh I think you were  talking about  I thought it was a memory  oh no  it was a dream  when you're sleeping  we're talking about 
[02:12:00]  she says  Chip go outside  cause Lamar gotta  help me fix something  and then you look  through the window  and his back  is all sweaty  and the back of his  dark chocolatey  butt cheeks  are all sweaty  and she's digging  her fingernails in  and he's doing it  so hard  that the lamp  falls off  the end table  and you know  your father  bought it out  or something  and you don't  pull out  and he just  leaves it in there  and he punches  it in the face  that's what I think  that's what you think  well uh  wow  Dr. Chibberson  you've been  very informative 
[02:12:30]  thanks  thanks  say hi to your mom  I'm going to be  a couch  psychologist  with the armchair  one  but you talk  to couches  yeah I know  that's what I said  thank you  thank you  Dr. Chibberson  okay  I did great  dude  I was there  a bit of  cracking up  hang the phone  that was really  funny  fucking  the price  of having  it's a regular  respond  god damn 
[02:13:00]  Dr. Chibberson  is uh  Jimmy  you missed  Dr. Chibberson  when you went to the bathroom  he's really good  he's very insightful  with um  with dreams  yeah  he had a really good one  about his mom  I'll tell you about it  sometime  boy you think  the bowl represents  the bowl of spaghetti  that hit the wall  and then  and then the pizza  is like Italian food  and the old woman  saying help me  is my mom  and the only thing  I can think of  as helping  is taking the bowl away 
[02:13:30]  according to our website  the bowl was the womb  like that's a  it's a motherly thing  so there's definitely  some kind of mom  thing going on  yeah maybe you were scared  that your father  was going to hurt your mother  and that you couldn't  help your mother  and you would see him  yelling and screaming at her  and you were just like  little fucking  little skinny  waif bodied fruit  hiding behind the  fucking whatever  so if I ever have a dream  that my girlfriend's pregnant  I just take a bowl  and throw it down the stairs  is that  will that represent  a good egg  no  what you do is  you fucking scrape  the bowl out 
[02:14:00]  scrape it clean  put it in the  scalding hot dishwasher  you take a fucking  you take a hoover  and you clean  the inside of the bowl  pour Drano in it  get every piece  of tomato  yeah then you bury  the bowl in a ditch  poor little bowl  poor little bowl  wasn't bigger  than the squirrel  oh that's fucked up man  yeah maybe it means  something like that  yeah  god damn  we haven't taken  a break or anything  have we  we've taken one  one  that's a cray cray yo 
[02:14:30]  that's off the  his hook  I'll tell you what  right Rich  let me tell you something  when I'm working  in Buffalo  June 17th  I won't be taking  a break  when I'm at  oh boy  don't help him  at Nitsy's  music hall  wait wait  what's the name  of the place  I like to  I like to spell  my name  so the listeners  don't screw it up  now how do they 
[02:15:00]  how do they  what's the word  if you spell  something the way  it sounds  instead of the  actual spelling  maybe we could  spell it that way  oh  you know like  instead of spelling  something the way  it's actually spelled  instead of spelling  like psychiatrist  you would spell it  with a P  right you wouldn't  spell P-H  you would spell it  S-Y-K  psychiatrist  K you know  something like that  so you  and what is that  called  writing something  oh phonetically

[02:20:00]  an email  to people  and I  say I'd  like to  try to  get Brian  Johnson  on my  boneyard  show  and they  forward it  to her  they might  want to  say this  is Jim  Norton  yeah  he has a  boneyard  show  hi  Ted  do you  have to  keep  banging  on the  yes  I do  because  it's  fucking  irritating  angry  that's  what he  does  when he's  angry  unfucking  believable  what's  that  I'm not  faulting  her  she's not  supposed to  just recognize  my email  address  well

[02:22:00]  why can't  you just  deal  directly  with  them  with  like  because  I don't  give a  fuck  about  that's  me  being  selfish  but I  don't  care  about  their  schedules  and  other  channels  I  don't  care  it's  like  this  is  what  you  want  you  shouldn't  care  this  is  what  I  want  hi  Ted  that is  a bad  one  imagine  calling  everybody  you know  based on  their email  address  like  the  first  thing  in  the  address  okay  so I  sent  the  email  slobbering  too  bag  all right  thank  you  I would

[02:26:30]  too  I  sometimes  get a  little  up in  arms  about  the  guesting  on  this  very  program  well  sometimes  I go  like  I  didn't  want  that  guy  and  then  I'm  trying  and  then  the  guy  I  know  well  you  know  you  somehow  got  in  again  under  the  wire  yeah  you  know  sometimes  you  get  a  guest  and  then  go  oh  I  don't  want  that  guest  and 
[02:27:00]  then  you  realize  why  am  I  talking  to  this  guy  thank  god  we  have  fucking  I  will  say  this  I'm  so  happy  I  don't  have  to  rely  on  50  people  for  this  show  yes  really  if I  didn't  push  and  complain  I  would  get  nobody  on that  fucking  show  nobody  yeah  you gotta  get in  there  and I  know  I  should  I  don't  this is  one  thing 
[02:27:30]  I  hate  about  working  for  like  with  his  50  stations  you  only  one  of  the  very  few  disadvantages  I  know  I  should  I  know  that  there's  other  people  to  be  considered  besides  me  I  don't  give  a  fuck  you're  paying  me  to  do  a  show  I  want  to  fucking  get  these  guys  on  and  it's  like  why  wouldn't  I  want  to  interview  Brian  Johnson  for  my  show  I'm  on  five  nights  a  week  why  wouldn't  I  want  to  you  should  be  a  you  should  be  on  their  mind  whenever  they  have  a  musical  guest  you  should  be  one  of  the  guys  that  go  okay  here  here's  the  list  of  stations  Jimmy's 
[02:28:00]  show  or  Ted  yes  he's  fake  it was  cordial  though  again  I'm  not even  shitting  on her  there's  no way  she could  know  that  right  because  nobody  told  her 
[02:28:30]  no one  told her  you know  again  but  the odd  part  is  I  don't  know  her  at  all  that's  the  relation  we  have  I  don't  know  this  person  yeah  someone  needs  a  talking  to  I  don't  know  who  but  someone  needs  to  be  talked  to  there's  nothing  worse  than  just  utter  disgust  because  there's  nothing  you  can  do  about  it  you  just  have  to  like  just  take  it 
[02:29:00]  and  it  great  wow  well  we  do  have  Sam  Robertson  here  who  is  our  resident  expert  on  wrestling  and  what  a  huge  story  that  came  out  over  the  weekend  wow  one  of  the  biggies  gone  yeah  one  of  the  biggies  gone  uh  macho  man  randy 
[02:29:30]  macho  man  savage  maybe  the  biggest  would  you  put  him  as  well  I  would  put  Hulk  Hogan  as  the  biggest  sure  as  far  as  you  know  history  goes  longevity  well  now  of course  longevity  you know  because  he's  still  alive  but  I  mean  career  longevity  and  yeah  you'd  have to  put  the  Hulkster  second  would  you  put  Macho  Man  Randy  Savage  or  Rowdy  Roddy  Piper 
[02:30:00]  how  about  The  Rock  maybe  not  longevity  but  Andre  the  Giant  those  are  more  famous  Calhoun  all  right  there  you  go  23  Skidoo  again  Andre  the  Giant  I  think  was  more  famous  than  any  of  them  no  yeah  but  in  terms  of  impact  Hulk  Hogan  had  the  biggest  impact  and  then  The  Rock  had  a  bigger  impact  than  Macho  Man  but  it  was  a  different  era  yeah  yeah  I  think  I'm  just  talking  wrestling  like  overall  not  just  a  part  yeah  of  like  I  don't  know  and 
[02:30:30]  The  Rock  you know  because  of  acting  you  kind  of  in  hindsight  look  at  him  as  he  had  four  or  five  years  that's  it  yeah  The  Undertaker  is another  one  yeah  but  since  1990  he's  been  around  and now  it's  yeah  but he's  not  you know  snap into  a slim  gym  no  no  which  one  did I  meet  the  guy  with  the  mask  which  guy  with  the  mask  he's  a  monster  how  about  Goldberg 
[02:31:00]  Goldberg  is  not  flash  in  the  pan  how  about  the  other  one  there  are  lots  of  other  ones  the  other  one  the  Brooklyn  Brawler  classy  Freddy  Blassy  you  horses  assy  there's  a  guy  who's  editing  with  Bonnie  and he  made  a  documentary  on  wrestling  I don't  know  the  name  but  he  followed  like  four  or five  wrestlers  for  the last  six years  have you seen this  well was it a big  documentary  one of the 
[02:31:30]  wrestlers  died  in jail  he overdosed  or something  he was in jail  I'll get you the  documentary  you'll love it  please do  no for you  because you're a  wrestling kid  well yeah  he's a wrestling kid  but I think  Macho Man  was probably  behind Hulk Hogan  the biggest  I mean  there aren't  many other  wrestlers  who garnered  the attention  that he did  it was on  every single  news channel  on Friday  it really was  yeah  and they've  never done  that  think about  if another  wrestler died  if it would  just be like  as big a story 
[02:32:00]  as it was  I think  that's pretty  big  yeah  I think  Macho Man  probably the  second biggest  what about  Bruno San Martino  I don't think  he's as big  as a Macho Man  no  back in the day  he was  it's all relative  what if  Ultimate Warrior  died  you think he'd get  the coverage  like the Macho Man  no  I don't think  he would  and I think  that also  has a lot  to do with  the fact  that his legacy  was somewhat  tarnished  towards the end  somewhat  yes  who  the Ultimate Warrior  what happened  Warrior  just  well he's just  crazy 
[02:32:30]  yeah  he's bat shit  crazy  what about the guy  that pissed himself  in here  I had a cheek  camel clutch  I humble you  I fuck you in the ass  and I humble you  he became a bit  of a parody  towards  yeah that's true  his legacy would be  that he became  a bit of a parody  curly shoe joke  but for me  when I was a kid  Macho Man  was way more important  Macho Man  was very flamboyant  could rock the mic  better than anyone  yeah  one of the best  we were up  when we were up  in the Poconos  the other day 
[02:33:00]  we went to a  convenience store  beer store  and it was very  convenient  they had beer  and there was  a tin  a round tin  with Slim Jims  in there  and it was  the outside  painted  his picture  was on it  and he's like  whoo  and I'm like  Macho Man  Randy Savage  picture  and I was like  telling the guy  behind the counter  collect this item  right here  yeah  they tried to have  other wrestlers  do the Slim Jim  commercials too  none of them 
[02:33:30]  worked the way  Macho Man  did  the Warrior  did Slim Jim  the Warrior  did  yeah  do you have  that on  YouTube  or something  like that  maybe we can  talk to Troy  because all the  conspiracy theorists  oh no  are theorizing  that perhaps  Macho Man  was responsible  for making sure  that the rapture  didn't happen  yeah I heard  tell that  now some people  think Macho Man  had a heart attack  I actually have a  picture of him  saving the day  it's right here  as a matter of fact  see what happened 
[02:34:00]  was  Macho Man  came off the  top rope in heaven  and gave the  flying elbow to  Jesus  who was about  to fuck the world  up  just ready to  get that rapture  thing going  and Macho Man  gave the  flying elbow  to Jesus  that's not real  somebody added that  and just  and  stopped the  rapture from  happening  I've got an  wow  an Ultimate Warrior  Slim Jim commercial  and a Bam Bam Bigelow  Bam Bam Bigelow  who the fuck  Bam Bam Bigelow 
[02:34:30]  New Jersey's finest  yeah  wow  alright let's see  well that's the  curse of the  Slim Jim commercial  here's Warrior  here's Warrior  oh shit sorry  come on Dan  what do you want  to do  I don't know  what do you want  to do  you boys a bit  bored  snap me to it  snap me to a  slim Jim  snap me to a  spice  make me just  a taste  hey  noise  antique  snap me to it

[02:35:30]  original  the macho man  Randy Savage  there's a lot  of parody  a lot of  parodies  turning up  lately  a lot of  people really  taking his  death  seriously  taking it  to heart  oops  I always like  to keep  my favorite  snack  handy  get a little  excitement  snap me to a  slim Jim  oh yeah  now that's a  slim Jim commercial  what happened  well  something happened

[02:37:00]  slapped  by another man  that might make  Jake Roberts  check the Snake  that might make  you a little bit  over the edge  macho man  talking about Jake  that might make  you a little bit  insane  but not me  Snake  man  not me  cause I  know  what I'm going  to do to you  tonight  what are you doing  maybe I am  insane  maybe I am  insane  and maybe it's  time for you

[02:38:00]  herself  she bought the real  ones  yeah  you can still  wear the wristband  now you have to  put bark on it  and windshield glass  snap me to a slim jim  that was fucking  horrible that commercial  yeah  well um  so they're saying  he had a heart attack  yeah they said  he had a heart attack  while he was driving  well that's what  his brother is saying  because I think  the autopsy  we've been Lanny Poffo  yeah the autopsy  reports said  like inconclusive  or something 
[02:38:30]  no heart attack yet  well he might have  been on those  steroids huh  well I mean  steroids don't make  he could have been  but why jump to  conclusions  why jump to  conclusions  by the way  38 days  38 days on the  wrestler death clock  oh wrestler death  clock was reset  who was the last  wrestler to go  sweet and sour  Larry Sweeney  sweet and sour  Larry Sweeney  went 38 days ago  a mere 38 days ago  he hung himself  at a wrestling school 
[02:39:00]  did you know him  or no  yeah I did  I worked a show  with him  oh shit  he was 29  get out of here  29  Larry Sweeney  was yeah  and he's still  in school  in a wrestling school  why did he  anybody have any  comments on why  he would have  done that  at such a young age  he had some  problems  he had severe  bipolar  and a whole bunch  of stuff that  made him lose  a couple wrestling gigs  so why did he  just bring it back  why does he  keep buying it  oh chip  no it's two  the macho man 
[02:39:30]  Randy Savage  was 58  58 years young  exactly double  the other guy's age  oh my god  which is  which is  58's old  for a wrestler  that's fucking  90 for a wrestler  that is  that is true  why was he still  wrestling  no  no it's just  most wrestlers  don't make it to 58  no  not wrestling  but they live  incorrect  just  it's not  that's not what  I'm saying  did you see  any accident pictures  yes  I saw a picture  of the car 
[02:40:00]  smashed up  on the tree  yeah did it  because I haven't  seen it  but I heard  it looks like  he just drove  smack into a tree  yeah  he just drove  through a divider  into oncoming traffic  passed it  into a tree  think it was suicide  no because his wife  was in the car  they were arguing  oh his wife  was in the car too  his wife was  minor injuries  not Miss Elizabeth  by the way  because my mom  called me and said  Miss Elizabeth  was in the car  with him  no  I had four  my mom  Miss Elizabeth  had died  several years ago 
[02:40:30]  is she dead  yeah Miss Elizabeth  is dead  from like pills  and alcohol  is she a wrestler too  she was a manager  she was the first lady  of wrestling  one of the bimbos  that come out  I remember the name  was she from the 80s  one of the bimbos  that come out  with the wrestlers  you know  she was Macho's wife  in real life  oh really  for a time  now  hanging out with  Lex Luger  and partying  and she died  now though  reunited in heaven  well I don't know  because sensational  Sherry who managed  the Macho King  also dead  so we'll see  wow there's a  friggin brawl 
[02:41:00]  going on up there  maybe they'll have  some kind of a  match  in heaven  to win the  fancy of the  Macho Man  and you know  at one point  Macho Man teamed  with Mr. Perfect  who is also dead  who is dead  holy shit  wrestling is an  amazing activity  as a tag team  you're never gonna see again  Perfect Maniacs  yeah  gone forever  I was part of a gang  called the Maniacs  were you  were you Chip  what did you do  fuck everything  oh yeah  was it drugs 
[02:41:30]  was it uh  vandalism  was it stealing  no no we just like  selling candy  we stole  oh you stole candy  yeah  it's not Maniacs  that's tough  fuck it right at  the store though  boom  boom  I guess I shouldn't  have taken that  opportunity to put  that spoonful of  soup in my mouth  you're listening to  more Macho Man  promos  yeah  a little bit  later on  against Bing  the face of terror  from the dungeon  of doom  that means 
[02:42:00]  that Luger  and the Macho Man  Randy Savage  would indeed be  meeting here at  Halloween Havoc  how did anyone  take that seriously  one day on  one to go  you know what  stop it  yeah  and we have  even a little  audience participation  yeah  because I'm wild  yeah  and I'm gonna tell you  something  thanks  you said about me  a few days ago  yeah  and I don't think  you can separate  business from  friendship  I'm your friend  but if I ever 
[02:42:30]  see you in the ring  I can beat you  don't you know  yeah yeah yeah  Randy Savage  I know you're  your mustache is crooked  you're very  sideways too  but I don't want  to get into that  I'm not gonna  take personal  pot shots at you  or anybody else  that's not my nature  get in line  everybody  I'm a little  better guy than that  I don't mind telling you  I'm a bigger man  cool  how did we get into this  that's okay man  very curious  I'm gonna take  Lex Luger  because I know  he's gonna beat Ming  because I'm gonna  make sure he does  can we just  get away from the  subject of the 
[02:43:00]  Luger  potential Randy Savage  match  I want to ask you  one other question  because everywhere I go  people are talking  about these two  monster trucks  that are gonna be  colliding here  a little bit later on  the giant in the  dungeon of doom truck  and your good friend  Hulk Hogan  in the Hulkster's  monster truck  my curiosity  is killing me  just like a cat  would be killed  my curiosity  yeah  because of the fact  machine versus machine  and man versus man  doubled and tripled  by the exposure  of the WCW  heavyweight championship 
[02:43:30]  belt  don't you think  I have a little bit  of interest right there  friendships  friendships  business is business  Hulk Hogan already  threw the line  in the sand  I'm just following  in the sand  all right  we're gonna be  watching very closely  a participant  and I'm gonna be  watching too  through the video  scope  thank you the  Macho Man  Randy Savage  he is one of a kind  let's get you back  inside  a lot of a kind  you know  I was just  suggested  in my little  headphones here  yeah  I mean  we're talking about 
[02:44:00]  how I'm coping  with the loss  of the Macho Man  true  but I mean  the only thing  that would make  me feel better  is to hear  a real fan  of wrestling  doing his best  Macho Man impression  somebody like  a sex bagel  I guess  maybe  if he could do that  now  he does an impression  he does a Macho Man impression  of the Macho Man  does he  oh yeah  oh please  hopefully from  a few days ago  you know Jim  you should really be  nicer to your  fellow co-star  you should be  mourning the loss 
[02:44:30]  of your co-star  what  because you  two guys  were in the same  film together  oh that's true  he was in  Spider-Man  he was in  Spider-Man  oh was he  yes  wow  after we  after we deal  with this tragic  situation  somebody  owes an apology  oh boy  oh  shite  oh  oh  so let's  get iraq  oh boy  somebody  uh-huh 
[02:45:00]  jumped the gun  ah  I know  I know what's  going on  curious  but I thought  that you knew  that already  this will make  sense in like  ten hours  very curious  very curious  indeed  did he fight  Hulk Hogan ever  of course he fought  Hulk Hogan  and mega powers collide  where is the sex  why isn't the sex  bagel on his way  well I don't know  that I don't know  the answer to that  let's get the sex  man to come in here  oh here he comes  oh  I can't wait  awful  I can't wait to hear  fingers  that's always my

[02:46:30]  doll  yeah or get  chocolate on  which  tried to tell  your dad it  was a puppet  his fingers  his fingers had  chocolate on  the macho man  was just stained  with a garlic  butter sauce  caramel all over  oh shit  just treats  whipped cream  aww  young b-rock  wanting to  cuddle with  his macho  man buddy  but he wouldn't  give up his  dessert  but he needed  his treats 
[02:47:00]  b-rock had the  little chocolate  in the corners  of his mouth  kissing the  macho man  any of this  happen b-rock  no  not at the  all right  just wanted to  get the facts  out there  now we hear  tell through  our own sam  roberts  that somebody  in this room  does an amazing  macho man  randy savage  impression  it is not  I but I  am willing  to try  well what  do you  mean it  is not  well actually  it's not him  because he's  not in character  I mean I  spoke to our  producer and 
[02:47:30]  he said if you  wanted an intro  with the music  and the whole thing  that he could leave  if we want to do  this right like  Eric can leave  and I can do  the macho man  music  we need the  music  and then he  gets the mic  and then does  an impression  hold on  oh shit  he rocked his  kiss  he just threw  the mic down  he went to pick  the mic stand up  it came apart  in two pieces  and then instead  of putting it back  he threw the mic  down  because he wanted  to slam down  the whole mic stand  but when he pulled 
[02:48:00]  it it came in half  so it lost the effect  oh my god  he's like Jerry  Lundegaard with the  ice scraper  is Iraq  gonna  participate in this  I owe an apology  oh yeah  let's get Iraq  we have to get  the music  where's the music  here it is  here he comes  and here comes  oh my god  the macho man  Randy Savage  coming in  what a spectacle  this is

[02:49:00]  I like that impression  because I'll tell you  why  because Eric  gets the dynamics  the low  of the macho man  because I would have  just started screaming  macho man shit  no  but Eric knew  that sometimes  the macho man  gets real down  and talks to you  from his soul  but then he gets  really angry  some of Friday  I got my money  on Sam  because he's  out of breath  from that  oh I know  he's huffing  and puffing  from doing  an impression  wow  you know  I wanted to  goof on you  but you did  you had the 
[02:49:30]  dynamic down  I told you  he did  I was humiliated  that was the first time  I was  what a haunting  tribute  to the man  the myth  of the late  macho man  Randy Savage  very sad  very very sad  indeed  are you going to  go out back  and bury your  little macho man  buddy  no that's long  poor little feller  I wish I still  had it  really  don't have it  who likes wrestling  more  you or him  I do  I like it a lot  but he's way  into it  like it's scary 
[02:50:00]  how well he's into it  see Sam likes it  from the viewpoint  of somebody  that knows  a lot about it  the people  the dynamic  the business  end of it  and Eric knows it  like a five year old  that just likes  the colors  because he has no friends  Eric Stowe  Eric Stowe  gets upset  when the good guys  lose  come on  does he like  John Cena  he loves John Cena 
[02:50:30]  John Cena  would he want a  John Cena doll  do you think  oh he has them  he's gotten John Cena  to sign them for him  wow  definitely  and I remember  when we went to  the Wrestlemania  press conference  last time  he was the one guy  in the press  who was wearing  a Triple H t-shirt  while we interviewed  Triple H  Eric was wearing  a Triple H t-shirt  that was the size  triple H  triple H  do you think  that um  because he was  getting all those

[02:56:30]  I have  my spectrum  it goes from  the joy  luck club  to the  godfather  what movies  do I  you know  what  you don't  listen to  music in  your car  do you  you listen  to talk  radio  I fucking  hate it  what do you  mean you  hate  you do  it  everyone else  sucks  no you do  it on tv  talk  but it's  funny  it's comedically  based  I'm talking  about  in the car 
[02:57:00]  talk radio  I used to  listen to it  is  unlistenable  to me  I just  can't  listen to  these  fucking  boring  motherfuckers  just droning  oh my god  democrats  and republicans  political  talk radio  shut up  there's no  humor to it  at all  and they're all  fucking predictable  exactly  just like this  program 
[02:57:30]  no  on tv  I don't mind  there are some  that I think  years ago  years ago  I used to think  Jay Diamond  was great  back in  remember him  he was good  when he sang  sweet caroline  right  Bob Grant  I love  yeah  of course  he's gonna lean  to their sides  but you'll get  lean  it's boring  it's just  listening to  other guys  opinions  who gives a  fuck  what they  think  music  I used to 
[02:58:00]  listen to it  and I'm like  why do I  care what  this motherfucker  thinks about  anything  gives a  fuck  they're very  passionate about  their  and you know  the house  has the  republicans  and the  democrat senate  committee  shut up  gives a  fuck  what about  sports radio  horrendous  yeah that is  bad  can't fucking  listen to a  minute of  sports radio  it's terrible  I'll tell you  what I've heard  on the radio 
[02:58:30]  that I love  there was an  hour show on  Sunday  or two hours  of movie  like movie  critics where  they discuss  movies  I love that  kind of shit  what the fuck  I've heard it  all  I've heard it  already  at least you  know what  am I gonna do  listen to  roundabout again  something different  but music is  more fun to  listen to than  a bunch of  guys  I listen to it  once in a while  I got my  greatest hits  he just wants  to find out  and sound  smart  what are you  talking about  you're right  you learn  you don't learn 
[02:59:00]  you learn their  opinions  no you'll hear  the story  and then you  make your own  opinion  but I do that  on my fucking  way  no if you  listen to the  same talk  radio  you read the  news  or you go  from different  news sources  it's not quicker  go to Drudge  Report  and then you  go to  Huffington Post  you go to  a bunch of  different sites  you don't think  they lean to  a bunch of  that's why I'm  saying a bunch  of different  sites  I didn't  listen to  all different  talk radio  I don't listen  just to the  right  I'll listen  to the  left too  yeah I do  to get aggravated 
[02:59:30]  the left  how are you  going to listen  to that  do you  yell at the  radio  do you ever  get annoyed  listening to people  I used to get  really annoyed  listening to  what's his name  fucking  Kubi  talk radio  oh god  just his  fucking  anti-white  self-hating  Jew  it just didn't  matter  whatever  black guy  would do  was totally  fine  it was the  white guy's  fault  and he would  get on the air  and just  talk about  how awful  the system  is  and how racist  everybody 
[03:00:00]  him and Lynn  Samuels  I used to  hate her  I cannot  listen to  talk radio  it is  horrendous  to me  horrendous  I just  I don't know  I either put on  that stupid  shit hour  after this show  I put on  the shit hour  is what it's called  starring Sam Roberts  or I just  listen to the news  like even that  it's not talk radio  but I put on  1010 wins  I put on 88  yeah I listen to that  yeah  cause then  I'm sick of 
[03:00:30]  listening to music  I really am  I've gotten to the point  where it's just like  I don't care  what am I  what am I gonna  start listening to  a lot of new stuff  I'm done  I think I'm done  listening to  there might be an  occasional song or two  where I'll be like  ah it's pretty good  I like that  but I think I've  reached the point  that sucks  I'm kinda done  I listened the other day  and I ended with  Nectar  Remember the Future  and it just went on  forever  and I said  you know what  I can't do this anymore 
[03:01:00]  you know  really  the Future  alright whatever  alright alright  alright empty garden  alright he's dead  we don't care  alright  do you have satellite  in your car Rich  huh  do you have satellite radio  no  I have it on my phone  I don't know how to work it  you should get it in the car  it's fucking  honestly  oh no I know  when I rent a car  it really is  cause I get to listen to  you know the comedy  channel  cause that's always fun  and I'm wondering  the 70s channel is great  the comedy channels  are the fucking  I'm going  how is this person 
[03:01:30]  on radio  they're the most  well they gotta fill time  it's fucking horrendous  they'll get some real shit  yeah the 70s  I listen to that  you can listen to the  fucking comedy  just to hear comics  that you hate  or bad comics  it is good sometimes  to hear the shit comics  and you go  how is this  when I get shit  when I get in on the road  I listen to Stern  he's fucking good in the morning  ever you listen to him  in the morning  yeah years ago  I listened in the afternoon  made me want to get into radio  and then once I  you know got into radio  hard to listen  you're doing it  I listened recently  cause he was  he takes these 
[03:02:00]  these vacation blocks  they play this fucking  like best of  whatever  like the history  and I knew for years  what happened with Jackie  but I never heard it  and I knew like a long time  and so I actually  fucking heard that recently  when Artie first came  and then when Artie  had his breakdown  I heard all that shit  and it was fucking fascinating  pretty cool  cause I knew the stories  kind of  but to hear it actually unfolding  I'm like Jackie  what are you doing  what happened  it was about money right  yeah  he wanted more money  yes  but to hear their reactions  or to hear these other  I just  I'd never heard anything  yeah  it was interesting  but where did Artie  like Artie 
[03:02:30]  like he never really  worked as a comic  he got TV  like right away  didn't he  I don't know  I honestly don't know  he got like Mad TV  yeah he was on Mad TV  and a couple of movies  cause he was from Jersey  but you never knew  you never saw him working  like he was a headliner  at a club  you know he does TV  did a movie or so  and next you know  he's you know  the right hand guy on Stern  you know  he just came out of nowhere  we're listening to Jackie  and just going like  what are you doing  yeah  cause you have the hindsight  there's an equity  to being on the show 
[03:03:00]  that goes beyond  just the paycheck  you know  especially if you're a comic  it's called  filling a fucking theater  reading joke books  it's called  filling a theater  doing what the guy  at the fucking  at the docks can do  okay  I learned a lot from Jackie  though before I ever met him  because  no no I mean  I mean  like that move that he made  and I understand  I've been  you know  we've all been tempted  to go fuck this  and walk  it's part of  just doing any gig  never once  but I remember  well if you ever had a gig 
[03:03:30]  that was worth leaving  but you fucking  you start to think that way  but I'm like  they moved on without him  and they just went into  a new era  and it's like  I'm not bigger on this show  than he was on that show  or not just this  but anything else  no no but I'm saying  of course you're not  I fell for it  so it's like  I actually did learn  from him man  like you can't  and he was there longer  you know what I mean  he's been there 15 years  sometimes people get  yeah a little uppity  and think a little 
[03:04:00]  too much of themselves  and find themselves  out the door  going like  what the fuck  did I just do  yeah you never think  you're bigger than the gig  no but sometimes  also people are so  tired or  they can't do it anymore  and they don't have  the courage  to say well I'm quitting  or I'm done  so this is a way  this isn't out  it's a gamble going  this is not a hard gig though  radio is not  it's like  when you're just hanging out  bullshitting  like this is work  this is not a hard gig  15 years  he had a family  you don't know how it  how it 
[03:04:30]  you know  what it did to his family  maybe he just said  I can't do this anymore  so let me go for broke  and if they say yes  then I  and if they say no  my response to your awful  demo  that was a perfect  that was a perfect  pause his face  that was great  I'm so happy  I had Brian Johnson  I'm really sorry I yelled  I feel very bad  you know what  you gotta base it  on the track record  you have been fucked over  we all have  so you jumped the gun 
[03:05:00]  but you had justification  but I did see that email  that said hi Ted sorry  so I of course reacted to that  nobody told me that I had him  so it's fair to me  yeah  bless you  so I apologize  I won't worry about it  it's fucking 940 already  I know  can you believe that shit  time flies  can you believe that  we should take like a  a quick break  and then we'll come back  and make love  listen I need  talk about some other shite  here's the thing in Buffalo  yes Buffalo  well I want to say one thing  at Nietzsche's  yeah on June 17th  I'm booked to do one show  but I want to do two

[03:16:00]  he's all  fidgeting  the fucked up  thing is  it's like  watching a  brundle fly  talk  the way you're  moving around  you two have  like fucked  in the same  the same girl  we didn't touch  yeah but that's  just it  but it's like  so he can't  even touch  your arm  yet you just  watch them  banging away  on some creepy  little thing  creepy guy  touching me  look at him  but he's one  of your best  friends  I don't like  him  not so much 
[03:16:30]  I really like  this guy  what's going  on with the  because obviously  the shit hour  is starting  very shortly  yeah  what's the deal  with Ronnie  and Fez  well  what do you know  of this situation  about what  situation  I don't know  because I won't  get specific  unless you are  privy to say  anything but I  think you know  what I'm talking  about  well are we  talking about 
[03:17:00]  the question  that I posed  to them or  the statement  that Ron made  give me a little  of both  well the question  that I posed  to Ron was  the question  that Opie  asked me to  pose to Fez  which is about  the nut house  right  and Ron said  that it was  under consideration  but this time  it would be a  longer stay  like maybe  two three years  two three years  so he said  though he would  continue Ron and Fez  and wait to see  how long it would  take people  from like a  crazy house  no he'd like  he would do it  by himself  and just wait  to see how long 
[03:17:30]  it took  and wait to see  how long people  oh oh really  he would just  keep doing the show  realize that there's  no Fez in the room  that's what he said  yeah  is Fez on medication  I think he is  yes  is he always  just having breakdowns  yeah he has  very bad anxiety  and he breaks down  a lot  why does he cry  so much  I think it has  to do with the  anxiety  probably the anxiety  it's a little  nervous  yeah  you get that  Rich  are you crazy  we just  yeah but  you still get it  just as bad 
[03:18:00]  click in and click  off  anxiety is fucking  horrible  because it can get  to the level  where you're so  disorientated  and it turns into  panic  what happened  disoriented  disorientated  disoriented  I said  that's okay  it's bad  anxiety  and why  you can't  concentrate  on it  no you just  because you think  you're going crazy  because you're going  why the fuck is this  happening  why is my body  and then you feed  into it  and it turns into  panic  the old rolling  snowball thing  I guess if that's 
[03:18:30]  how you would  compare it to a  rolling snowball  gathering up  and it just  becomes a monster  that's what I'm  saying  unless you could  nip it in the  butt  how long have you  had it  how many years  have you been  dealing with that  21  53  ever since you  stopped doing  drugs  no I stopped  at 28  but I started  with anxiety  at 21  but it goes  away  and comes  and goes  now I'm  getting it  now that I'm  talking about it  do you have  anxiety  because you've  got a big  stomach now  oh god  alright  why
