<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a bizarre, nonsensical phone call mimicking an insurance claim, setting a humorous, irreverent tone.  The bulk of the show centered on a disastrous live event at the Hammerstein Ballroom, their "Passion of O&A" show.  This segment involved extensive, highly offensive descriptions of two poorly chosen women hired for a stage bit intended as a staged reconciliation between Yankees and Red Sox fans. The bit failed spectacularly, resulting in the women being forcibly removed from the couch by stagehands.  The hosts’ commentary was filled with vulgar language, detailing the women's appearance and behavior.  Callers Larry (a producer), Marion (a frequent attendee who recounted her experience with security), and Rich Voss (a comedian who performed at the show) contributed to the discussion, adding their own anecdotes and perspectives on the disastrous event.  This discussion was interspersed with numerous vulgar jokes, sexually explicit anecdotes, and a recording of "I've Had the Time of My Life" sung by individuals described as "retarded people."  The segment also included brief sports commentary.  Later, they discussed an upcoming “O&A Family Feud” with further lewd commentary.

The broadcast then shifted to a listener's account of a bizarre threesome experience involving semen on the face, triggering a humorous discussion about alibis and the absurdity of the situation. This transitioned to a discussion of the hosts' personal lives, including rejected threesome opportunities and changing social dynamics.  The Iraq War was briefly touched upon, with Anthony expressing interest in graphic war footage. The show then covered NFL game results, specifically the New York Jets' loss, with commentary on coaching decisions. A Beastie Boys/Beverly Hills Cop theme song mashup was played, followed by their "F U" line, where callers left profane messages.  Commercials for XM radio punctuated the broadcast, leading to comedic bits about the hosts' Hollywood experiences and a discussion on the absurdity of helmets and helmet laws.  Further discussion involved the new U2 album and comparisons to other bands' release frequencies. Opie shared a story about a sponsored Mercedes ride to a comedy show that ended in a cab ride instead.

A significant portion focused on the negative experience at the Hammerstein Ballroom, detailing the lack of XM Satellite Radio promotional support, Sirius' aggressive competitive tactics (including removing XM signage and harassing interns), and the theft of an intern's bag.  This segment featured extensive use of vulgar language, including frequent use of the word "bitch."  An audio clip of Kevin Straley, an XM executive on ESPN’s *Cold Pizza*, was played, followed by speculation about Howard Stern’s move to Sirius and his contract negotiations.  An audio clip of Earl Weaver, a former baseball manager, filled with profanity-laced rants, was also played.  More commercials for XM radio and a Delphi Sky-Fi 2 device were interspersed throughout. The show concluded this segment with news items including the Scott Peterson verdict, Old Dirty Bastard’s death, Star Jones's wedding, and a naked man jumping into a crocodile pit. The hosts also briefly discussed the media's disproportionate coverage of a 57-year-old white woman giving birth to twins compared to a similarly aged black woman. Further complaints about the Hammerstein Ballroom incident and dissatisfaction with their employer concluded this section.

The next segment opened with discussions of videos showing dangerous animal interactions, including a man attempting to convert lions and a woman attacked by a bear.  A caller, Justin, made a “croc-blocking” pun.  “Ozone's Midget Sighting of the Day” featured a poker game with a dwarf nicknamed "Stacks." The conversation shifted to Jim Norton, allegedly caught stealing books while intoxicated. Bob the Trucker called in, recounting a 20-hour gambling spree, multiple DUIs, and his time as a prison trustee. Club Soda Kenny called to discuss the Hammerstein Ballroom show. The hosts discussed loyalty amongst former colleagues, expressing disappointment in Dice and Louis Black’s unavailability.  A Jay-Z/Linkin Park mashup was played, followed by a discussion on obtaining old show material.  The segment concluded with reflection on Jim Norton's past radio habits, a humorous exchange between the hosts, audio from Fallujah, and a mention of Jim Norton's book "Rent Boys."


A segment detailing Opie's early radio career in Buffalo included the disastrous "Pick Your Stones Weekend" promotion.  A listener's request for "Star Star" (a misheard Rolling Stones song) containing multiple uses of "fuck" played loudly during a convention center broadcast, nearly resulting in Opie's firing.  A call from "Lady Di" resulted in a lengthy, vulgar exchange with the hosts criticizing her appearance, drinking, and demeanor.  They introduced a new punishment for on-air mistakes: reading from "Rent Boys," which Eric (a producer) was forced to do.  The segment included extensive profanity, humorous descriptions of the book's content, and discussions of XM Satellite Radio sports broadcasts.


The final excerpt began with a discussion of an upcoming guest and Anthony’s premature theme music playing.  This transitioned to Colin Powell’s resignation, speculation about the reasons, the Iraq War intelligence failures, and potential further resignations.  A parody song, "Put the Fucking Lotion in the Basket," was played, followed by a phone interview with its creators, John and Al.  The "Guess What's in My Pants" segment involved a female listener, Angel, describing her pubic hair through sound effects, with Frenchie (a studio guest) guessing “Hitler mustache.” Frenchie then read a sexually explicit passage from a gay-themed book.  The show ended with closing comments, promotional material, and an angry phone call from a customer complaining about a utility shut-off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And if you're gonna let a fuck come between our love, there's something really wrong happening here, baby.  Good afternoon.  Hello. Is this an insurance place?  Excuse me?  Is this an insurance place?  Yes, it is.  Okay. I met this young lady. I think I wanted to marry me.  Hello?  Yes?  I met this young lady. I wanted to marry me, but I need your insurance to tell me if, you know, the marriage will be good. 
[00:00:30]  She'll make a good wife.  How am I supposed to tell you that?  I don't know. She don't cook or clean or nothing.  Well, I need you to ensure me that she's the right lady for me.  I can't tell you that.  She got a bigger bare belly than me.  That's why I'm trying to look nice and swell for Memorial Day, because I want to wear a nice bikini.  I got knob knees. 
[00:01:00]  I got knob knees.  Hello?  Yes, yes.  You can see my feet. They look like a bushel of corn.  Okay, how can this help you?  I don't know. She don't cook or clean. She's always dancing around the house. She used to be a dancer.  She puts rags on her head.  She looks like a beast.  She looks like a wife.  She looks like a Theseus Bewegers.

The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio.  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day. 
[00:06:30]  It's all about me.  I played golf with old guys.  I am a grinning idiot.  Hey, it's Romy and Anthony. We're back now.  The new climate of radio.  Ho, ho, Romy.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  Opie is crazy, big and beautiful.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  You'll be an Anthony show.  We stink. 
[00:07:00]  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits.  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  Smells like...  Smells like...  Victory.  That's right.  Don't just stare at it and eat it.  You like Huey Lewis on the news?  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 hole. 
[00:07:30]  Don't fall for that old guy.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Greetings and salutations.  Big day for the boys.  This is a brand new intro, huh?  Yeah.  Reworking the Rage Against the Machine theme.  I think it's Drew Boogie and...  Steve, get your ass in here.  One of Steve's guitar friends.  That's pretty cool.  Who did this?  This was Drew Boogie. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, you didn't let it play.  No, I know it's Drew Boogie, but...  It's Drew Boogie and Rob Balducci, a really, really great guitar player.  Right on, man.  Well, here we are.  We really didn't have a weekend.  No, you can't have a weekend when you do something Saturday.  We did a huge gig.  We didn't really talk about the gig on the radio that much leading up to it because it  was a sold-out show, so we didn't really have to talk much about it, but I guess there's  a lot to talk about today.  Yeah.  As far as the gig, we're talking about the passion of O&A at the Hammerstein Ballroom 
[00:08:30]  here in New York City Saturday night.  The passion.  Sold out 2,500 screaming O&A and Jim Norton and Jim Brewer and Rich Voss lunatics.  Yep.  It was a lot of fun, huh?  It certainly was.  A lot of people and a lot of...  Did you see Mary in there with her husband?  Yes, I did.  The retarded Laverne Shirley.  One half of the retarded Laverne Shirley. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, that poor bastard.  That's all I can say.  The poor guy that's with her.  Because now she's a celebrity.  Who knew?  She's a celebrity.  And this husband now has to deal with, first of all, everyone knowing that's his wife.  That's something maybe you want to keep under wraps, but she's leading him around and introducing  him to people.  And he's just embarrassed by the whole thing.  And you could tell.  Because he kind of, I don't know, he just seems like a normal run-of-the-mill kind of  guy. 
[00:09:30]  And he's married to that.  And she just wouldn't shut up.  And he's like, guys, can I come backstage?  No.  It's hard enough coming out on stage and having to look at you.  You know, we were doing stuff in between the comedians, and I was leaving the stage  once.  Did you hear what I said to the crowd?  There was 2,500 people.  I heard one voice.  And it was her voice.  Her voice.  Just screaming, whatever.  And I'm like, shut up.  Shut up.  Where was the other one?  Too drunk to attend? 
[00:10:00]  Was she even there?  No, I didn't see her.  Thank God.  Maybe she's in AA, finally.  I don't know.  Detoxing.  Detox.  Yeah, Larry's on the line.  You know, maybe the listeners could help us through this first break.  If you're at the Passion of ONA and you have something about the show, definitely give  us a call now, okay?  I do want to start with the...  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's let Larry say it.  Hey, Larry, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hello, Larry.  What's going on, Larry?  Saturday's show was amazing.  Yeah, we might...  One of the funniest things I ever saw. 
[00:10:30]  I think we're going to be forced to take that on the road, unfortunately, which means  Anthony and I will get no time off.  No sleep.  It was such a huge success.  I've got to thank Pete and the gang at Artist Group International, AGI.  They put on the whole shindig and got the videos together with the help of Steve from  FoundryMusic.com.  It was just a solid show, huh?  Yeah, well, maybe if you hit the road, you can get a little better opening act than you  had this time around.  You know, who got those girls? 
[00:11:00]  Steve.  You're saying $400.  You paid for them.  You know something?  I bet Norton wouldn't touch them.  I actually would.  I know Erica Cole and Lucy Luce.  Lucy, I was in Lucy Lou.  I don't know her.  Lucy Lou.  Lucy, the other girl.  Don't touch them?  Now I know that that's your depravity if you would touch them, though.  Absolutely.  They both do porn.  Of course they do.  Have you been with either one of them?  No.  One of those $1.99 DVDs?  No doubt.  Well, let me explain as Steve enters the studio here.  Thanks, Larry. 
[00:11:30]  You know, to start the show, Ant and I decided to go back into our bag of tricks and do something  we did about four years ago.  And we got everyone riled up, you know, asking how many Red Sox fans there were in the audience.  And of course, you know, of course everyone was supposed to boo like crazy.  Booing, yeah.  And then Anthony's like, how many Yankee fans?  The place goes nuts.  Uh-huh.  And then I'm like, can't we all just get along?  And of course they're going to say boo.  Yeah.  I mean, this works like a charm if you have hot chicks, Steve.  That's what we're going to get at in a second.  So then finally, you know, some stagehands, because we weren't allowed to touch crap on 
[00:12:00]  the stage.  Don't touch anything.  You'll get beat up outside by some teamsters.  Union rules.  So they bring the lesbian couch onto the stage.  And then, of course, one skank-ho from the left walks out, and one skank-ho from the right.  One had the Red Sox jersey on.  One had the Yankees jersey.  And then, of course, Anthony and I go, you sure we can't get along?  Now, the crowd at this point is supposed to get all riled up.  They see these hot chicks in the jerseys, and they're just eagerly awaiting them taking 
[00:12:30]  the jerseys off and getting along on the couch.  Yeah.  That's how it's supposed to work.  Yeah, but when they started walking out, and I think, you know, I don't know this, but  was the whole show on the big screen, too?  I do not know.  Oh, okay.  There was no video.  Well, it was pretty obvious that the ONA fans weren't feeling the skank-hoes.  No, no, no, no, no.  Which kind of did not help the bit.  No, because the girls were rank.  They were rank.  And then, who decided to put the black girl in the Red Sox jersey? 
[00:13:00]  No, they flipped for that, I believe, right?  Yeah, they did.  That was a flip.  Yeah, they flipped the coin for that.  Which is just hilarious.  That was the funniest part about the whole thing.  So then they start going at it, and Anthony and I are like, we paid $400 for this?  Me and Opie, I had to go to the ATM.  Yeah, after sound check, we had to go to ATMs and get cold hard cash, or the girls wouldn't  do anything.  I didn't even give the girl, I gave my money to Steve to give to the girl, because I didn't  even want to, like, hand her the money.  Dude, we think always on the same level. 
[00:13:30]  I'm like, there's no way I'm exchanging money with that skank.  No, no.  Here's my money, Steve.  You pay the bitch.  $200, you'd think you could get something a little better, Steve.  You know what we found out?  There he is.  My GDC.  Sorry.  It was the last minute factor that really killed.  Last minute factor.  It was actually Norton's friend, Yoshi, really, really helped us out with that.  He's got a lot of connections.  All right, let's calm down with the really, really helped us out, okay?  Well, you know what? 
[00:14:00]  He helped us out.  He helped us out.  It was either those girls or no girls.  I understand.  All right.  And they were, I'll say one thing.  All right, you might say you wanted to get girls that were, you know, smoking or tans,  but these girls, they performed well.  It wasn't like they went out there and didn't do it.  No, no, no.  They perform.  Believe me, you have to weigh it sometimes, like hotness, and it weighs against what will  they do on stage.  You can get hot chicks that aren't going to do anything.  Yeah.  Or you can get skanky girls that can almost get us arrested.  Right. 
[00:14:30]  Which happened last night.  I was thinking some more common ground there, maybe girls that look a little better.  Because when they took those jerseys off, I came face to face with the black chick's  ass.  Yeah.  And it was awful.  I could, I'm looking at...  Okay, horrific.  I'm looking at...  It was awful.  Discolored stretch marks, probably done by another, by some guy's cock.  It was awful.  Yeah, the lights were a little too bright on that stage. 
[00:15:00]  You want the crowd to go like, yeah, yeah, yeah, when they take it off, not, oh, it was  like that, oh, oh, it was like a room full of people watching the Theismann breaking his  leg footage.  Yeah.  It was like, oh, oh, oh, just horrified.  It's so true.  So then we realized that bit's going nowhere fast, so we call the Teamsters back on the  stage to just pick up the whole mess and get it off the stage so we can get to the show.  So, yeah, the Teamsters come out and they grab one end of the couch each and try to 
[00:15:30]  lift it up with the strippers on it.  As the girls are still going at it like crazy.  One guy had his side of the couch up, another guy couldn't get the other side of the couch  I believe at that point one girl was munching the other girls, you know what, there.  Well, you know something, might have been through the panties, yeah, but when they hit  the floor, because the guys couldn't pick the couch up, so we said, just dump them on  the floor.  So, the Teamster guys holding the couch tipped the couch and flipped the porn girls on the  floor. 
[00:16:00]  The place went nuts at that point.  And then they carried the couch off.  Now, the problem is the girls are still on stage.  So, they're laying there on the floor and that's when one of the chicks, I'm not even  sure which one, it was just a nightmare mess on the stage, grabs the other girls' panties,  pulls them aside completely, just pulls them aside and buries her face in the girl's snatch.  And I'm staring there watching and all I could think was to wave up the box that my family 
[00:16:30]  was in and say, hi mom, hi mom, look, look what I do for a living.  It's just awful.  Just in case you're wondering, this is it.  This is it.  Get a good look.  You know how I tell you it's just a bid on the radio?  Yeah, well, oops, that ain't gonna work anymore.  Yeah, just horrific.  And then it was all awkward because I was hoping the teamsters would be able to carry  the girls away.  Now, what do you do?  Stop eating that pussy and leave.  Leave the stage, guys.  You've made your money.  Leave. 
[00:17:00]  Go away.  Get up and leave.  Right.  Can someone get a mop out here?  Just mop the mess up.  You should have just pushed them off with a push broom.  That would have been funny.  I thought the girls were lovely.  Did you?  I enjoyed them.  They were nice, but we were thinking.  That bit only works if the girls are kind of like lipstick lesbians.  Yeah.  Beyond hot.  Like Taylor Law would have been a perfect person to have do that.  But don't forget, once you're in the balcony in the back, you can't see anything.  All you see is two little dots rolling around on the stage either way.  Oh, really?  The people up front were horrified. 
[00:17:30]  And I think the people in the back were horrified.  Yeah, they saw enough.  I think the people in the back figured it out.  I was convinced we paid 200 bucks.  The wave of emotion, trust me, the wave of emotion made its way all the way to the back  We paid 200 bucks each, and we were convinced that Jim was going to have sex with them because  they were bought and paid for.  We paid for it.  You eat it.  I was sure that somehow Jim would get the sex that we paid for.  I don't understand why you and I are always going to ATMs to pay for whores.  And we don't sleep with whores.  But we're paying for them all the time. 
[00:18:00]  Got to pay.  If Jim knew that was an option, that maybe he could parlay that 400 into a little oral  treats, he certainly would have tried that.  You absolutely could have.  Absolutely.  You should have.  Their time was bought.  It was whatever we wanted to do for that amount of time.  I didn't know that.  Fair game.  Did not know that.  After boss went on and started trashing them, I didn't think it'd be a good time to walk  into the dressing room with a semi.  They had no idea, actually.  Marion, what's going on?  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, good show on Saturday night.  Thank you.  Oh, great.  Hey, I'm the topic of the first five minutes of what? 
[00:18:30]  Me and my husband.  You and your husband.  Did your husband have fun?  Yeah, he did.  We had a good time.  I thought I was going with him.  I wasn't even thinking about bringing Diane.  Where did he get the mustache and groucho glasses from?  Oh, come on.  He's a nice guy, guys.  You've got to get to know him.  He doesn't like the fact that you're...  We hate to say this, but you're not...  I'm not a celebrity.  I don't play it around like I'm a celebrity.  Everyone knows who you are, though.  They're all like, oh, my God.  There she is.  There's the annoying mess.  But you know what? 
[00:19:00]  I don't flaunt it, and I don't push it, you know?  You don't have to.  All someone has to do is say, look for the rhino with the blonde wig.  And I'm not an alcoholic.  I'm glad that that's cleared up.  No, we figured that out finally.  We thought both of you guys were drinking, but now we know it's just Lady Di.  No, no.  Diane didn't go.  I don't know why she didn't go, and I don't want to talk about why she didn't go.  Do you think Lady Di is so drunk that she made two people look drunk and seem drunk?  Anthony, she's in...  Guys, I'm going to tell you one thing about her.  She's in a state of depression right now.  Who wouldn't be?  You think so is any ground she's standing on? 
[00:19:30]  Go figure, guys.  No, really.  She's in a state of depression, so you guys know what that's all about.  We've told her on many occasions to go get some help finally, but...  But she's not.  She's afraid.  You know what I mean?  She's struggling.  She's struggling.  What do you want me to say?  All right.  Well, you had fun, though, huh?  We had a good time.  I had a very good time there.  I just didn't like it when I was leaving.  I had to use the bathroom and the security guard said they'll close downstairs for security reasons. 
[00:20:00]  What the hell is that all about?  You can't use the bathroom before you leave?  The place is closing.  You had to leave.  The place was not closing.  I was still there hanging out.  I said to the big black security guard, I had to use the bathroom and he got nasty with me,  so I said, fuck you.  Oh, you told him, huh?  Why didn't you try the sexy blonde thing and wink your way past him?  What do you want me to do?  Blonde with a big ass.  Do you want me to pull down my pants and piss right here?  I was about to.  Oh.  Any of the black guys trying to pick you up? 
[00:20:30]  No.  I'm just saying, these security guards, they're fucking assholes.  They're doing their job.  No, they're not.  They can't.  What?  Nobody could go to the bathroom before they leave to go get the train?  That bathroom's cleaner than Penn Station.  Could you imagine a couple of thousand people wanting to use the bathroom after the show's  over?  They want people out of there when the show's over.  Show's over, leave.  I know, but you know what?  It was ridiculous the way they handled it. 
[00:21:00]  It's people like this that ruin it for everybody.  Absolutely.  No, it's not.  You don't pay attention to the rules.  A lot of people would want to leave and a lot of people were hanging out, talking bullshit.  And so I said to the guy, I just have to use the bathroom before I go get the train.  And I just kept walking away.  Hey, I was talking to Master Poe.  All right.  Tell Master Poe.  I said hello.  Do you really think one of us is going to go out and say, Master Poe, she says hi?  Yeah.  Why didn't you do an interview with Danny?  We had one of our interns getting sound bites from the listeners.  He didn't look like an intern. 
[00:21:30]  I'm sorry.  I don't know him.  And I thought he was a creep.  Look at you getting an attitude.  You thought he was a creep?  Yeah, I didn't know who he was, and I didn't believe him.  Marion, I was walking.  Anybody could come up to me and tell me they work for you.  I don't know these people that work for you guys except for Master Poe and Ziggy and Eric.  He's the only ones I know.  Marion, it's so easy to get a tape recorder into a performance.  You don't think he would be working?  How would he get a tape recorder?  I thought this guy was pulling my legs.  What the hell do you want me to do?  I told him no.  What do you think he was doing? 
[00:22:00]  I don't know him, okay?  No comments.  No comments.  No comments.  I shall not be commenting.  It's just I didn't know him.  I am not an animal.  You know what she says?  She goes, you know what you said?  What do you think I am, stupid?  What's he saying?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Marion, thank you.  We had a good time.  I hope to see you guys before Thanksgiving.  I'm off on the 24th.  I'm going to try to make it up there.  Well, Marion, you should come to the big event we're having in Long Island actually next Friday night.  I don't know nothing about Long Island, guys. 
[00:22:30]  I don't know where we're at in Long Island.  Where do you live?  No, the next gig we're doing, the night before Thanksgiving, we're going to be at the downtown in Farmingdale.  We'll start promoting that thing now.  What if you're going to do another gig in Manhattan?  I don't know.  We just did one.  I think we're taking the passion of ONA to Philly in the very near future.  Marion.  I may go, too.  Oh, Marion.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Totally nailed.  Bukkake Joe from Brooklyn.  Checking in.  Dude, it wasn't even the chicks that totally sucked.  The crowd was filled with a bunch of guys that were with their chicks. 
[00:23:00]  So when the girls came out, guys had to make that decision to either go crazy and get no pussy later on or just shut up.  There were a lot of couples there last night, wasn't there?  Yeah.  It was definitely a couples night, which is kind of strange.  You go to see Jim Norton on a date show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a fine place to take your girl.  I don't want to fuck you.  Look, at least I'm not him.  Oh, all right.  But, man, what else was going on there? 
[00:23:30]  I mean, there's so much else to talk about.  Should we take a break and then continue or?  Voss.  Yeah.  Hey, how'd you guys get there?  All right.  We'll get into that next.  And we got Voss on the line.  How's that sound?  All right.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Just wondering how you got to the gig.  That's all.  You know, in honor of Marion calling, I'm trying to take a break here because I want to play,  you know, segmeister here.  This is one of my favorite songs ever.  And it makes sense after talking to Marion.  That's the only reason I want to, you know, take a break here.  As you know, this is the brand new Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio, getting 
[00:24:00]  more gooder every day.  More gooder.  And every day, the listener is finding stuff that we used to play on the old show.  And I think we could talk over the intro a little bit.  Okay.  This is some guy that...  I think we're ready.  I think we're ready.  Actually, I'll just go to the vocals, but go ahead.  Some guy dropped this off for us, and he says that he actually was on the recording  session of this.  Seriously?  It was done at Great Adventure.  They had some special class come in. 
[00:24:30]  A bunch of retarded people came in for a little field trip to Great Adventure.  And you know those booths where you can do karaoke and record it?  Well, two retarded people walked in and did the song from Dirty Dancing, I Had the Time  of My Life.  You remember this from the old show?  Yeah, I do.  Well, we finally got it back.  Really cringeworthy.  I want to thank the listener that got us this one.  Yeah.  Every day.  Know what else we found today that we're going to play later?  The Earl Weaver clip? 
[00:25:00]  Oh, I like that one.  And Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  But first, in honor of Marion calling in.  This is a perfect place to play this.  And then when we get back, we'll talk to Voss and a little more about the passion of O&A.  Okay, but check this out.  If you've never heard this before, crank it up.  I've had the time of my life, now I've never felt this way before. 
[00:25:30]  Yes, I swear, it's the truth, and I owe it all to you.  Cause I've had the time of my life, now I've always felt confused.  I've been waiting for so long, now I've finally found this one to stay by me. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, we're riding on the wall, and you felt the magic called fantasy.  Yeah, we imagine it all right, it's the way because it's died secretly.  So we take each other's hand, something they understand, so we don't see.  Just remember what you're the one, you're the one, you're the one. 
[00:26:30]  You're the one, you're the one, you're the one.  So I tell you something, there could be love, because I've had the time of my life,  That I've never felt this way before, that I swear, it's the truth, and I owe it all to you. 
[00:27:00]  And my body and soul, can't you know that you never know?  No.  Don't let it go, be afraid, don't lose control, no.  You're the one, you're the one, you stay, stay with me tonight. 
[00:27:30]  Me, stay together, I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one.  I can't get enough of, so I'll tell you something, there could be love, because I've had the time of my life, 
[00:28:00]  So I've never felt this way before, but I swear, it's the truth, and I owe it all to you.  I've never felt this way before, but I'll tell you something, there could be love, because I've never felt this way before.  So I've never felt this way before, but I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one, I'm all one. 
[00:28:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:29:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:29:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:30:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:30:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:31:00]  We'll be right back.

And covering.  But a touchdown to Rosario.  It was defended well, but the ball got there before Clark could turn around. 
[00:32:00]  Was it Clark or was it Trey Brown?  Trey Brown turned inside and the ball came outside.  Third down and nine.  At the 17-yard line.  Left hash mark.  Olsen back to throw.  Steps.  Throws.  Caught.  First down and more.  Might be a four-scorer unless they can catch Taylor.  He's at the 30.  Trying to get it from behind.  Inside of the 10. 
[00:32:30]  Touchdown UCLA.  Oh my.  And those calls courtesy of ESPN Plus, Oregon Sports Network.  The Pac-10 game of the week between Oregon and UCLA.

So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:36:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  I guess they weren't the sponsors of the passion of O&A.  We found that out the hard way, huh?  Wow!  Oops.  Saturday night at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  It was Anthony and I with three of our very good friends.  Jim Brewer, Rich Voss, and of course this meaty mess that you're currently staring at, Anthony. 
[00:36:30]  Jim Norton.  I stare every day.  And I got to tell you, you know, we abuse Voss and stuff.  And we got to let people know.  The guy just killed on stage.  He was hilarious.  We always make fun of his material and this and that.  But when it comes down to performing, the guy just does a great, great job.  And Norton, I got to tell you, Norton, you were the best Saturday night.  Oh.  Now Norton will downplay and say, eh, whatever.  I mean, Brewer killed, too.  Everyone did great, but you had the set of the night, man. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, thank you.  It's hard to tell with that weird acoustics in that room.  Hammerstein is so large.  Remember, you hear that's very hard to hear.  But, yeah, it was great, I think, all around.  Oh, they were laughing and laughing.  Yeah, I saw a few knee slaps.  I'm like, you know, if I can make just one person happy.  That's all that matters.  Jay and...  Can I throw one thought in parenthetically?  No, I know where you're going to go, and it'll be a 10-minute tangent.  No, no, it's not.  It's about the song we heard.  Yeah.  I enjoyed that retard song very much, but I just had to say, ladies, if you're pregnant  and you get a sonogram and you see one of those things floating around your womb, look 
[00:37:30]  for steps or an open elevator shaft.  Back to you, Ope.  Thank you.  Speaking of which, Jay wanted to comment on the song.  Jay in Jersey, what's up?  Jay!  Are we...  Are our phones working?  Yeah, no, that was...  I think that's Jay.  Speaking of Voss, he's on the line.  Let's talk to Rich Voss.  Hey, Voss.  Hey, what's happening?  I know you don't have XM Satellite Radio yet, so I was just complimenting you on your  fine set at the Hammerstein on Saturday night.  I'll tell you, when those two lesbians got up, the couch had stretch marks. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, wasn't that awful?  I liked them.  Oh, how horrible.  And they're $200 a pop?  I know.  200 bucks.  The first time I pay for a whore, and it's that.  200.  Yuck.  In Brazil, you can go a week for $400.  400 bucks and probably get a real hot one, right?  They were brutal.  Yeah, they kind of wrecked our bit, but we were kind of desperate, so we went to Steve,  because we know he's a smut peddler, and he knows the women, and that's when he got us. 
[00:38:30]  So what can I tell you?  Not quite a caliber of...  Anthony and I both had to go to the ATM machines and then break out the cash to pay the girls.  Oh, they were brutal.  Let me tell you, I never talked so fast on stage that night, because I swear to God,  I didn't want to slip up once and let them get me.  Oh, yeah.  Voss kept, like, there was not one dramatic pause.  There wasn't any gap between his bits or anything, his material, because he didn't want the people 
[00:39:00]  yelling anything out at him.  No, well, because first of all, one, when they start booing your name on a big screen,  it's not a good sign.  Right from the beginning, I'm going, oh.  Yeah, the videos that were playing.  We had video clips of our show and then video clips of the comics before they came out.  And Voss' video clip is playing, and the crowd starts going, boo!  They're, like, booing his video clip.  But then you came out and totally won him over.  Voss, they have a weird...  The crowd has a weird relationship with Voss, because they do love Voss. 
[00:39:30]  It's not like they don't want you there or they don't like you.  It's just, like, that weird vibe you have with him.  They feel compelled to boo him, but then they laugh their ass off.  Of course they do.  They never don't laugh.  They never don't enjoy the material.  They always love it.  Whether it's at him or with him.  We're going to go back to Voss in a second, but Rob from Long Island  has something to say.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I saw Voss Friday night at that bowling alley gig that he did.  Yeah.  Over at Wildwood.  And I heard me and my friend are, like, friends with the guy who was hosting the show. 
[00:40:00]  He said that Voss came from New Jersey and got there around 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  So slept from 4 o'clock to 9 o'clock in his car in the parking lot before he went out on stage.  Well, Voss will do that, and I'll...  What did I do?  What did I do?  You slept in your car?  No.  When I got there, first of all, first of all, you're friends with the host at a bowling alley,  okay?  So that's nothing to brag about.  But here's the thing, okay?  First of all, the host...  I got a tryer.  First of all, the host wore a suit like it was some big dick, all right? 
[00:40:30]  And right now, the host is redoing his resume thing.  I opened for Voss, okay?  All right?  And you're a friend of his?  All right?  So one, okay, so you're a zero to the second power.  But here's the deal.  I got there like an hour, an hour and 20 minutes early, so I'm not going to stand in  the bowling alley.  So I just sat in my car, and I took a nap.  What's the big deal with that?  How do you wake up?  What's that?  I keep an alarm clock, a traveling alarm clock in the car.  God, the life of a comedian, it's got to suck because you get this gig in Riverhead 
[00:41:00]  at a bowling alley.  I'm sure you did fine.  And then the next night, you're at the Hammerstein Ballroom, sold-out show in front  of 2,500 people.  Yeah, well, here's the thing.  When I took the gig, I didn't know it was a bowling alley.  All right?  Well, I didn't take it.  My agent took the money.  The money was...  Were they bowling while you were telling jokes?  No.  That would be hilarious.  I said that.  I said that when I was up there.  What gave away the fact that it was a bowling alley, and the contractor said your dressing 
[00:41:30]  room will be lane four?  First of all, it wasn't bad.  I mean, the guy, there were really nice people, the guy that ran and stuff, you know?  But, you know, I mean, it wasn't a bad crowd.  I know there was a puppet act there that only drew 30 people.  Puppet act.  What do you call it?  Did you have a good crowd?  It wasn't bad, but you know what's funny?  They roped off the stage like I was working Woodstock, like they were going to rush the  stage or something.  Tell me you...  Hello?  Hello?  I thought we lost it. 
[00:42:00]  Tell me you were doing your act in the middle of the bowling alley.  No, they set up the stage at the end of the lane, and they put chairs down.  You're lying.  I'm not lying, I swear to God.  So there were people whose chairs were uneven in the gutter?  No, I was at the edge.  They couldn't...  They weren't allowed there.  But there was even worse.  A band went on after me, and the police...  So the band's playing to like three people.  And you're standing there just feet away from the pin sweeper, just in case you tell one  bad joke, they could just sweep you in.  Sweep, my man.  Sweep you in.  Pop another comic out. 
[00:42:30]  I hit an all-time low of patheticness tonight when I was playing Scrabble on the computer.  I'm playing against the computer, right?  Yeah.  I have a dictionary, but I turn my back to the computer like it can see me cheating.  And not only am I cheating with a dictionary, I still lost.  Of course you did.  And how old was the kid you lost to?  No, this was just regular.  You're playing against the computer.  I was playing against the computer, but when I would look in a dictionary, I would spin 
[00:43:00]  my chair and turn my back to it.  Who plays Scrabble on the computer?  I play...  You know what the computer is capable of?  Yeah.  And you're playing a board game on it?  Well, because here's the thing.  I got to...  Because every time me and Bonnie go in...  Oh, I got to tell you this story.  You'll love this.  This isn't new the other night.  When we go on the road, we bring a traveling Scrabble board.  So we, you know, we like to play Scrabble.  What happened to you, Voss?  Oh, my God.  I know.  I can't believe I'm talking to Rich Voss.  Where's my best friend that I used to pull trains with and get blown in Central Park with? 
[00:43:30]  Now it's...  My girl and I are going on the road.  We got the new travel-size Scrabble.  We got the travel-size Scrabble and the alarm clock, so we're not tardy.  But here's the thing.  We were playing last week in Orlando.  Yeah.  And there's little letters that...  In the travel one, and we lost the letter M.  This is true.  And we're like, hello?  Yeah.  So we lost the letter M.  We're looking for it.  We couldn't find it for like two days.  I swear to God.  Then we found the letter M, right?  I found it, right?  And I didn't tell her.  And like when we fool around, like sometimes I like, you know, a finger to get on my, you 
[00:44:00]  know, my balloon knot, right?  So I took the letter M, and I put it like in my ass a little.  Oh, God.  And I was pulling around.  I go, can you?  I swear to God, she pulled out the letter M.  You don't think that's funny?  The only thing I don't believe about that story is that they were little travel-size letters.  I think you put the entire rack filled with seven.  Let me tell you.  Anyhow, back to the show.  It was idiosyncratic, and it was up his ass. 
[00:44:30]  That crowd was so hot the other night.  Yeah.  They, I'm telling you, when you can get a room with 2,500 people just to sit and listen  and watch a show like that, do you know what I mean?  They were so good.  After the show, when they came by, and they went to Norton's store, and they were buying,  hello?  Norton's store.  They went to Norton's store because Macy's was closed.  This guy got more product.  He's my idol.  Yeah.  My idol.  Norton was selling CDs, DVDs, six or seven versions of his T-shirt, all the stuff you could 
[00:45:00]  get on EatABullet.com, by the way.  Six shirts, yes.  Six shirts.  I went over there and bought some lumber and sheetrock, because I'm doing a little stuff  around the house.  It's unbelievable, but he's got it down.  Do you own that, like, where they hang the stuff up on and stuff?  No, I don't travel with that, with the barrier between the showroom and the, no, I don't travel.  Let me check my stock room.  I'll see if we have that for you, sir.  No, Club Soda Kenny actually had the foresight to bring hangers, but I have these guys, this  guy Paul and his wife told my merchandise, and they came up and brought all these shirts. 
[00:45:30]  You know, it was fun, man.  Cool.  He's got so much merchandise, Jackie Martling's calling him for tips now.  Ah, he's not the only one he's calling.  Dave from Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Boss actually, like, the sound system there was horrible.  I don't know if it was just me, but it was horrible.  The only person that sounded good was freaking Boss out of everybody.  But it was a great show, and everybody was great, but was it just me that the sound system  sucked?  It's weird acoustics in that room.  Yeah, because the theater goes up so high, it's really tough to, you know, make the sound 
[00:46:00]  perfect.  It's not meant really for the spoken word, you know.  It's meant for music and singing.  Yeah, we did get a few complaints about it.  That was the only complaint we got that sometimes is out.  Hard to hear, depending where you were sitting.  Yeah, I was in the Italian section, not in the Opie section.  I mean, Anthony's section.  Ah.  Yeah, my brother almost, like, got in a fight with Anthony's uncle.  And my brother would have lost that fight big time, because I don't know what's going  on with Anthony's uncle.  Uncle Tony?  Uncle Tony, yeah.  Uncle Tony came in, and... 
[00:46:30]  Uncle Tony came into my family's box.  It's the wrong box.  And my brother's like, what are you doing here?  And then your Uncle Tony's like, well, what are you doing here?  And then you had some words, Anthony.  I got to tell you.  I think this is our box.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, my brother's a psycho like myself, but I think he would have lost that fight.  I'll give you that one.  Speaking of which, we should bring this up on the air right now.  Anthony came up with the bit.  I think it'd be fun.  And we're going to do this in the very near future when we can get everyone in here.  It's going to be the O&A family feud.  Because both of our families...  Oh, there you go. 
[00:47:00]  Both of our...  Will Hughes family, ready for action!  Both of our families are pretty effed up.  Yeah.  In their own...  Sure.  In their own way.  I think it'd be cool.  Put together a bunch of questions and have them go at it.  And we'll have Norton as the host.  And yeah, it'll be your family as my family.  I was just going to say, I can't wait to...  When it's time to...  Like the Richard Dawson version.  Yeah, yeah.  Not the Louie Anderson.  No.  Hi, I was fingering when I was eight.  I'm going to go with the Richard Dawson version.  Where he just slobs on them. 
[00:47:30]  Come here, love.  Come here, love.  How old are you?  You're 85 years old.  You haven't been tongued in a while, have you?  You're not kissing my sister, by the way.  My hot sister.  Your sister is smoking.  You're not kissing my hot sister.  I love everyone.  Give him a little hep.  Oh, wait.  I haven't met your sister.  I'm thinking of your sister.  Dawn is a hottie, too.  She's smoking.  Yeah.  I haven't met your sister yet.  That was on purpose.  Trust me.  Your brother's not bad.  I'd mug with Brent a little bit. 
[00:48:00]  Stay away from my brother.  I got to tell you one thing.  It might piss off some listeners, but my sister just got a couple kids.  She doesn't get out that much these days.  I think that was the first time since we moved back to New York that she saw one of our gigs,  Anthony, and she was horrified how we're treated by our fans.  At one point, I'm not sure if it was the booze, but all of a sudden she just goes,  Why are all these faggots taking pictures with my brother?  Oh, jeez.  Really?  I'm like, wow.  How many Budweiser's did we sneak up to the box for you? 
[00:48:30]  Hey, the overall sense is, do you think the audience liked me?  They loved you, of course.  They loved you, yes.  Okay, because I was talking too fast to even realize what was going on.  No, they loved you.  They get it now.  They get that it's a bit for the show and that when you're actually on the stage,  you do a really good job, man.  And you had new material, which is always a bonus.  Well, this week when I'm working in Chicago, I'm doing a lot of new material at Zaney's.  Which Zaney's, Rich?  Chicago or Vernon Hills?  All three of them.  And my DVD has so much new material.  Oh, God. 
[00:49:00]  I don't know.  I'm only kidding.  Who cares?  Go to RichFoss.com.  You can get the DVD.  I was hanging with Norton last night at dinner, and we were talking about you, Voss.  You're the only guy that could do crowd work at a 2,500-seat arena or theater,  whatever you want to call it.  I mean, everyone understands a crowd work comedian.  You go to a small comedy club, and there's a guy who has to hammer everyone in the front row.  Wow, look at your head.  Or where did you get him from?  All that crap, right?  Yeah.  But Voss has spotlights in his eyes. 
[00:49:30]  I mean, when you're on that stage, you don't see anybody.  You can't see crap.  And you're still doing crowd work.  Yeah.  And pulling it off.  And the night before, he was doing crowd work.  Hey, what size bowling shoe do you take?  Hey, you know what I got to do?  I got to get a copy, like a DVD of that phone, the thing you did with Bonnie on the phone.  Yeah.  All right, we'll get you a copy of that.  I thought you meant you needed to get some tweezers.  For what?  No, when you said, you know what I have to do? 
[00:50:00]  I'm like, get some tweezers to get the M out of your ass?  Oh, no.  That's already taken out.  Yeah, Russell from Jersey says, tell Voss to cut the Scrabble joke from his act.  What Scrabble one?  Justin, Voss is a douche.  Uh-huh.  You know, speaking of playing online games, for a while there, I was playing chess online.  I got into this chess thing all of a sudden, so I'm playing, you know, guys online.  You know, chess.  You're playing chess online.  Another board game that he's playing on the computer.  Well, I haven't played it in a while, but for a while there, I went through a little thing. 
[00:50:30]  Like, I want to play chess online instead of staring at porn all day.  So I was killing in this one room, just killing everyone, all newcomers, just taking them  on, right?  And finally, I got a wake-up call.  This person's like, you know, because you can talk to the people while you're playing  chess, you know, because I played this one that turns out to be a kid like three or four  times, and I'm just killing him.  And he's like, how old are you?  And I'm like, well, how old are you? 
[00:51:00]  I'm eight.  Eight years old.  So now I can't fess from my real age.  I'm like, oh, I'm 14.  Because I feel like such, first of all, you feel like a creep.  You feel like almost like a...  I type that in, too, but it's not in the chess room.  Right, right.  I'm 14.  And you almost feel like a freaking pedophile, even though you're not.  But you're like, why am I talking to an eight-year-old boy online?  No reason you're talking to strange young children in any way, the phone, live, or on  a computer.  You should not be having little chats and playing little games. 
[00:51:30]  I thought I had some skills, and it turns out, no, you're just beating up an eight-year-old  in chess.  I tried the chess on, not against anybody, but the Mac that I picked up has chess on it.  So I just click and give it a try.  I hadn't played chess in years.  And three moves.  Three moves, the computer, like, aced me.  Gone.  I was gone.  I had no clue what I was doing.  I play okay, and the computer murders me.  I've never beaten it.  How the hell do you beat a computer?  It knows what to do. 
[00:52:00]  Grandmasters, guys like Kasparov and Kramnick, those guys whipped the computer the way he whipped  that eight-year-old.  Yeah.  Yeah, on certain levels.  Not French, but I mean, chess master they beat.  When Opie said he played the eight-year-old, how come you don't have the sound effect of  Norton's zipper going down?  We don't need the sound effect.  It just flies down.  And by the way, Ben comes stumbling in here with his hurricane hair, and the first thing  he tells Anthony is that you were chicken out my dick in the bathroom. 
[00:52:30]  He did not see my dick.  First of all, no, we went to dinner on Saturday.  And be honest.  Have you ever seen my dick?  No.  He was trying to.  Because you like to gossip.  Every Ben story goes a little too far.  There's a little exaggeration.  A little exaggeration.  So instead of telling the story how it was, you're not going to believe this, Anthony,  but Jim was checking out Opie's dick in the bathroom.  He went into the stall with you.  Yeah.  It was a horrific story, but he never saw mortified people in the bathroom.  We were in the steakhouse before the show. 
[00:53:00]  After the sound check, we all went out to eat.  And Opie walked into the men's room, and Ben was in there.  So I was talking to Opie just to make people in the bathroom uncomfortable.  Well, hold on.  I went into the stall, but I left the door open, you know?  Why would you ever do that?  Why would you leave the door open?  I leave the door open if I'm taking a leak.  Yeah, but see, he didn't know he was coming in.  I don't know why.  And I didn't know he was coming in.  He did that in the dressing room, too.  I come walking up the stairs.  I turn my head, and there's Opie taking a leak in the bathroom.  It's like, oh, shut the door.  He wants you to accidentally see his mule.  No, not at all.  Accidentally.  He wants people to, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  I've seen Voss's dick.  I've seen Norton's dick.  Oh, isolate that.  Oh.  Oh, we have...  What?  Voss, Anthony saw it, too.  I've seen a photograph.  All right, I should clarify.  I've seen a photograph of Voss.  Voss will just walk up to you and go, hey, check this out.  And you grab the picture, like he's showing you a photograph.  And you look at it, and then you realize what you're looking at.  And it's a penis on Levitra, first of all.  We're playing golf, and he's like, oh, I've got to show you something.  In the middle of hitting shots.  It definitely is nice.  It goes right on the red side. 
[00:54:00]  You should only have fingers that long.  So it's a nice steakhouse, right?  And I'm in the urinal with the door open, because the...  I mean, I'm in the stall with the door open, and the two urinals were taken.  That's why I went in there.  I was like, whatever, I don't care.  And then were you...  Ben was in there.  I was at the urinal.  And all of a sudden, like, there was a couple of businessmen, I mean, really dressed nice,  and they come walking in, and that was Norton's cue to come into the freaking...  He will always embarrass you.  Into the stall.  And he's like, just...  Not only is he behind me, he's now walking, trying to see my dick.  I'm just kind of peeking over the side, and I'm just talking about... 
[00:54:30]  You're sharing a stall.  So then...  Oh, yeah.  I just go to the business guy, I scream, and I go, he's trying to look at my penis.  And the guy was more...  He didn't know what to say or do.  It's a really nice steakhouse, and I'm just trying to check out your little pink mule.  You cannot go to any public place with Jimmy Norton.  He will embarrass you.  When I was at a wedding, I left my camera on the table, and Florentine and Norton took pictures  of their cocks.  But I didn't know him.  When I got the pictures back, I recognized Norton's cock.  That's how many times I see him, and I go, I know that cock. 
[00:55:00]  There was one time me and Florentine were doing that.  That's Florentine's gag.  That's Florentine that invented that.  But one time we were doing it, I think it might have been with your camera or at someone  else's wedding, where one of us was in the stall, bending over, opening our ass cheeks,  and the other one was squatting behind, taking shots.  And somebody walked into the bathroom and went, oh my, and walked back out.  I thought, I didn't know what your camera was.  Oh, that's good.  Classic.  Here's Florentine's ex-girlfriend.  Her brother got fired from his company, because it was a company function, and he took the camera 
[00:55:30]  off the table, and he went into the bathroom, and he snapped photos of his mule, and they  fired him, because they recognized the suit in the picture.  Oh, what an idiot.  He lost his job.  How great is that?  No, that's a great reason to get fired.  That's classic.  I told you the story of, you know the park story with me and Norton.  I guess when you guys were on sabbatical, I picked up, remember, this happened when they  were on break, when we picked up, I picked up that 19-year-old, this is when I was single, 
[00:56:00]  or 20, remember, we went back to your place, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So we go back to Norton's place, right?  Well, first, I'm in the car, right, with her.  He's driving, and we're in the back seat, right, and we're fooling around, and he keeps  like staring, looking back, like, you know, some weirdo.  In the mirror of the mirror.  No, he's in the mirror and over his shoulders, so he goes, why don't you just, you know, we'll  go to my house.  Like, and she kind of really didn't want to have anything to do with him, but, you know,  since I'm on the team, so we go back to his house, and we're somehow, like, me and her 
[00:56:30]  are fooling around, but he keeps pushing himself in her face, right?  So, like, whatever, I finish, and he's laying there with her, right, and he's spanking it,  and then I turn, and he shot a load, and it was all over his face.  It was dripping on his face.  Oh, my God!  And I'm sitting there, and I look, and there's a big load on his, you know, and he had no  chin to block it, right? 
[00:57:00]  So, as you know, and this is my idea, she goes, you know, she said, you know, can you  sign an autograph for me to her?  You know, so we both signed something, and I go, can you sign these condom packs saying  that I had a great time?  You know, that's the proof that, you know, nothing went wrong.  Right, they always need their alibis, these guys.  There's nothing worse than sitting on a couch, looking at that, you know, jellyfish next  to you with a big load all over his face.  Oh, you were real legal eagle, Rich. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, sign the condom, that'll hold up in court.  Your Honor, I want to put this as Exhibit A.  She signed the rubber saying she had fun, charges dismissed?  That couldn't have been gotten under duress.  Yeah, that's true.  That was kind of fun, though, wasn't it?  Kind of fun.  It was a lot of fun.  It's more fun than I have with you now.  Oh, I got to go.  I got a seven-letter word.  Click.  Freak.  You used to be a lot of fun back then.  It was all trains and loads on the face and young chicks. 
[00:58:00]  And now it's Scrabble.  Yeah.  And cell phones and balling locks.  And now it's, what's a Vietnamese unit of money?  Quick.  I turned down a threesome last night.  Oh, look at you.  Oh, with those two girls?  Yeah.  The one I kind of thought was kind of sexy.  Who, the blonde?  Yeah.  I mean, the other one you used to date, so I couldn't, uh...  You could have done...  What are you kidding me?  She wouldn't have, I mean.  She wouldn't have.  All right.  Well, we're going to let you go, Voss.  You're running out of air.  You did good today.  You did good.  You did good.  I had a couple good stories.  Listen, we were just recapping. 
[00:58:30]  You know, it's not like...  Relax, dude.  Hey, Voss, how'd you get to the gig, by the way?  Oh, well, they were supposed to send me a car, but instead I said, since they're not,  I'll drive myself, but I have a car picking me up, taking me to the airport in a few minutes.  From them?  Oh, what is he doing?  I don't know.  All right.  We'll get into your car story next, because now we're running out.  What car?  I don't have a car story.  I know.  Oh, boy.  And there's other things we'll do on the show.  We got your Fallujah audio, Anthony.  Oh, good.  Anthony loves war.  I like watching the war show on TV, because, you know, you see your tax dollars at work. 
[00:59:00]  If we have to be there, I want to see some of it.  It all looks kind of nice when you watch a war movie in a weird way.  You know what I'm saying?  This is the real deal.  We got audio of actual, you know, stuff going on in Fallujah.  They're showing a lot of stuff now.  They're getting a lot of tape from Fallujah, and some of the equipment we have on our side  is just amazing.  These rocket launchers these guys put on their shoulder and just fire off and just blow up  a whole building up full of those fucking animals. 
[00:59:30]  And I don't want to talk about football today.  My Jets lost in overtime, 20-17.  It's over.  But they lose, too.  Oh, freaking Ravens.  What's their record now?  The Jets?  Yeah.  What are we up to now?  What's the difference?  They're not going to win the division.  They have, what, three losses?  I think it's three, right?  Weren't they 5-0?  Yeah.  Their coach calls the dumbest.  Coaching yesterday by him, I can't even believe some of the calls he made.  Well, they lost their quarterback.  Yeah, but Quincy Carter's not a bad.  Quincy's a good backup, though.  Or Dallas.  He took over.  I think that's when they went downhill, right? 
[01:00:00]  No, he's just, today was, yesterday was the first game.  Oh, okay.  First, where he started.  Then Patriots beat the Bills, of course.  Giants.  Go Pats.  Giants lost to the Cardinals.  Good.  I mean, everyone knows.  I hate when radio shows do football scores.  Because if you're a fan of the team, you know what your team did.  You already know.  Pittsburgh's the team.  You don't care.  Pittsburgh's unbelievable.  And the Cowboys, I predict, will upset the Eagles tonight.  Shut up.  And only lose by 20.  There you go.  With that, why don't we take a quick break.  We're going to play a mashup.  These mashups are taking over the world, Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  They are.  Taking over the world.  Yeah, they are.  Well, they have been for a while.  Who's in the mashup?  We're going to do Beastie Boys and Beverly Hills Cop theme song.  Axel F?  Axel F, yeah.  Axel F.  We mix this together, and this is what happens.  All you Trekkies are TV addicts. 
[01:01:00]  Don't mean to this, don't mean to break static.  All you Klingons in your grandma's house.  Grab your backstreet friend and get loud.  Pull the doors off inches.  Grab you with the pinches.  And no, I didn't retire.  I'll set you up with the needle-nosed pliers.  Like you, you're like I'm a whore.  What do you know you've never seen before?  Gliding in the glazing.  Like Lord D, you know what you're doing.  Like a bracelet with a basil.  Not groovy like Darren, I hate you. 
[01:01:30]  So I'm a boy, I'm taking a knife.  With practice to be running, let you know.  All right.  Now, I remain calm and overlong.  But the form ain't fast.  So what's up with that?  I got friends and family that I respect.  When I think I'm too good, they put me in checks.  Don't believe when I say I'm no better than you.  Except when I rap.  So I guess it ain't true like that.  You're all in, you're just no star.  Guaranteed to make your boxy raw.  Check, check, check, check, check it out.  What, what, what, what's it all about?  What, what, what, what, what, what, work it out.  Let's turn this, turn this party out.  I said, doctor, what's the condition? 
[01:02:00]  I'm a man that's on the mission.  I said, son, you better listen.  Stuck in your, what, is an electrician?  Like a scientist.  Mmm, when I'm applying this?  Method of control in my mind.  Like I sign a rap and do comply.  Now, hey, baby, bubba, now what's the deal?  I didn't know you go for that mass appeal.  So call it Salucci, some appetator.  I stole your mic, but you won't see it later.  Cause I wear magic like a magician.  I had love for magic to be shunned.  At the bank I share, engineer.  I wear cotton and I don't wear jer. 
[01:02:30]  Shazam and abracadabra.  In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya.  Don't worry, don't jump yourself.  Put that back on the shelf.  My phrase blazing.  Yada phase in.  My crew's amazing.  We're working on the record, y'all.  So just stay patient.  Check, check, check, check, check it out.  What, what, what, what's it all about?  What, what, what, what, what, work it out.  Let's turn this Perkins party out.  Now I know by the name of the king as well.  I don't wear a cup nor a job. 
[01:03:00]  I bring the that's beyond bizarre.  Like Miss Piggy.  I am the one with the clientele.  You say I rock, you rock so well.  I got glass like pink champagne.  Lipsy ain't got the mic before the mic goes stale.  Don't test me, they can arrest me.  Big back, I saw what you left me.  You look upset, you'll come down.  You look like cable guy, dumps over your crown.  I throw like smoke out a chimney.  You're never been me.  You wanna rap with your big name here, poppy. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, oh, oh, now.  Bitch, I'm come right out of the tire.  Quick, I'm gonna roll up on your tire.  Squat the press.  Shataya.  Tonight we're going out, let the town of fire.  Set the sound of place.  Gonna start and amaze.  Ready to throw a crazy.  Make a baby shake your head, say,  Now check, check, check, check, check it out.  What, what, what, what's it all about?  W-w-w-w-w-w-work it out, let's turn this, turn this party out!  Check, check, check, check, check it out! 
[01:04:00]  W-w-w-w-w-what's it all about?  W-w-w-w-w-w-work it out, let's turn this, turn this party out!  The very worst of the Opie & Anthony F U line  Yes, hi, my name's David, I'd like to give a big fuck you to Opie & Anthony  You guys, even though you make funny gay people, I still love your show, but fuck you anyway 
[01:04:30]  I just want to say F you guys for getting that fucking porn song stuck in my head.  It's 4 p.m. Central Time and I'm still singing Internet Porn.  Ah, thanks a lot. Fuck you guys.  Hello, this is Black Earl.  I'd like to leave a big F you to Wayne Brady.  You're a black man. Put a little nigger in it.  Hey Wayne, go after yourself.  Hi, this is the English language. I'd like to give a big F you out to Opie for butchering me. 
[01:05:00]  Oh no, I suck.  Call the Opie and Anthony F you line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.

Everybody you meet, the people at drugstore, grocery store, waiters, waitresses.  They're all frustrated screenwriters, directors, actors.  Even a policeman stops me for drunk driving.  He's a frustrated choreographer.  Instead of having me walk the line, he wants me to follow after him. 
[01:06:00]  All right, here we go.  And follow after me.  Step, kick, fall, change, step, rise, and step, step.  Step, kick, fall, change, step, rise, and step, step.  Smile, pretty shuffle off the buffalo.  Pretty fingers.  So I miss the step, bitch.  Don't get me pissy.  I am in a mood.  Skydiving was definitely the scariest thing I've ever done.  Let me ask you this question in regards to the skydiving. 
[01:06:30]  What is the point of the helmet in the skydiving?  I mean, can you kind of make it?  You jump out of that plane.  That chute doesn't open.  The helmet is now wearing you for protection.  Later on, the helmet's talking with the other helmets, going,  it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly.  There are many things that we could point to as proof that the human being is not smart. 
[01:07:00]  The helmet is my personal favorite.  The fact that we had to invent the helmet.  Now, why did we invent the helmet?  Well, because we were participating in many activities that were cracking our heads.  We looked at the situation.  We chose not to avoid these activities,  but to just make little plastic hats so that we can continue our head-cracking lifestyles.  The only thing dumber than the helmet is the helmet law,  the point of which is to protect a brain that is functioning so poorly 
[01:07:30]  it's not even trying to stop the cracking of the head that it's in.  At least the helmet is functional clothing.  I appreciate that.  Unleash the power of XM performance in your home.

That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee. 
[01:08:30]  This is the best show ever.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello, hello, hello, hello.  I'm at a police call, but it's all.  It's everything I wish I didn't know.  It's a joke.  Give me something.  I can see you.  U2 Vertigo on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I was tracking through that latest CD all weekend long.  Track 5 and track 6.  I don't even know the names of them. 
[01:09:00]  Two huge hits.  The one about beautiful, City of Blinding Lights, and all because of you.  Those are good songs.  Unbelievable songs by U2.  I think, well, obviously the album's going to be a smash.  Duh.  Duh.  Is this their first new album in a long time?  No, actually 2000 was the last one.  Was it really, 2000?  Uh-huh.  Remember the old days, your favorite band would put out an album like every six months?  Eight months, maybe.  Eight months?  Six months?  Well, when we were growing up, Kiss was putting out albums like every six months for a while  there. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, yep.  And now, like U2 is one of my favorites.  They put out an album every five years now.  Look at like the Beatles and the Stones.  I mean, the Beatles put out tons of records.  I mean, they would just pump out and they were good, too.  That's what's amazing.  Yeah, the Beatles were doing.  Those are in the ancient days, though.  But the Beatles were doing an album a year for a while there.  Yeah.  Definitely.  And that used to be the thing, but you don't have to anymore.  So, when was the last time Ozzy?  What was the last Ozzy album?  I really don't care.  I'm wondering if, I know you don't, but I'm going to answer anyway.  It wasn't Osmosis.  It was Back on Earth. 
[01:10:00]  It was a live album, wasn't it?  Pukata or whatever?  Alive in Budokan.  Budokan.  Yeah.  Like when?  Alive in Budokan, huh?  Yeah, he doesn't rip off anybody.  Oh.  Yeah, okay.  No, it was a very cheap trick title.  I want you to want me.  Right.  The Dream Police.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  The Dream Police.  The Dream Police.  Da-da-da-da-da.  All right.  What were we going to talk about after the break here?  A loister call.  Did you want to talk about your ride to the venue? 
[01:10:30]  What ride to the venue?  The yellow cab that I hailed?  It was fantastic.  The guy was brown with a mustache.  What happened?  Getting ready to go to the venue.  I hear how there's a club center Kenny calls me.  He tells me there's a deal with Mercedes.  And they're providing cars.  The official sponsor of the New York Comedy Festival.  And they're providing cars for everyone.  I was very happy.  My hotel room, I was waiting.  And I got a phone call.  Bring.  Bring. 
[01:11:00]  And I answer.  And it was my driver saying, I'm down in front, Mr. Cumia.  Anytime you're ready.  And I went down.  There was my car.  Got in.  Drove me to the venue.  It was very convenient.  Very nice.  Didn't have to worry about it.  Yeah, very good.  Same thing with me.  It was awesome.  Really?  Yeah.  Funny, because I went downstairs.  And I had merchandise and a suitcase.  And as it always happens to me, whenever something nice is supposed to go down, I'm standing  in front of my building like an asshole with a suitcase and no car. 
[01:11:30]  Willie Lohman.  Yeah.  He's got a big bag.  You're like the traveling salesman.  Oh, that's funny.  And I poke my little head down the street.  I'm like, yeah, maybe this is it.  Where is it?  And I suddenly realized that this car is not coming.  I wait 10 minutes.  Because instead of just getting...  It's only 10 blocks from my house.  But the idea of showing up in a Mercedes really thrilled me.  Did you look like Jennifer Jason Leigh in Fast Times looking for Damone's car to take  you to the abortion? 
[01:12:00]  Wow.  Nice reference.  This is going to be a Mercedes with little prick written on the door.  I was so...  So I get in a cab.  I call Kenny.  I'm like, look, man.  The car's not here.  And it's not his fault.  He's like, I'm very sorry.  I'll check into it.  So I hop in the car.  And whatever happened, Kenny did his job.  Ben did his.  They did the emails.  And Mercedes fucked me.  Oh.  So thanks for nothing.  Thanks for nothing.  Thank you for nothing.  Did they get to the bottom of it? 
[01:12:30]  No.  Let's find out who's...  No, why would they?  Who screwed up?  I don't know.  They called my cell phone in the middle of the night thinking I was you.  The car was still at the Hammerstein at like 1.30 in the morning.  But I don't know how they got my number out of the clear room.  The car waiting for nobody.  Everyone's home.  Just how awful.  Who's in charge of that?  How did that happen?  Oh, boy.  It's some woman that Kenny kept calling sir in the emails.  He was like, Mr. So-and-so.  Kenny goes to me on Saturday.  He goes, you know, that was a woman the whole time.  I said, I had no idea.  Well, whoever this androgynous incompetent is, thank you for nothing. 
[01:13:00]  He, she, or it, or whatever you are.  That shouldn't be in your job.  I'm nine blocks from the venue.  Nine blocks.  I think there was a mix-up.  What can I tell you?  What else is...  Of course there was a mix-up.  God forbid there shouldn't be one.  So you had to drag your merchandise and throw it in the trunk of a taxi.  That was awful.  Taxi, I'm dragging a stupid suitcase full of shirts.  Your big night at a sold-out show at the Hammerstein Ballroom.  That happens every day.  And there you are lugging your luggage into a cab.  Did the suitcase have a little pull-out thing that it turns into the table that you sell 
[01:13:30]  the stuff from?  No, they haven't.  Like an old, oldie-time salesman?  Let me tell you what you need.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have an elixir of life here for you.  Selling snake oil, yeah.  Well, yeah, really.  I think we're going to start talking about bringing the passion of O&A to other cities.  I think it's going to be Philly next.  I think Boston's in a possibility, and maybe Cleveland and Buffalo as well.  Well, before we do that, let's just call up and see what city Sirius wants to go to first. 
[01:14:00]  And I think then we can go to those cities, and, you know, they're going to do it.  They'll sponsor the event.  Absolutely.  That was great to have them there.  They'll go there and not be able to hang up any XM signage.  No wow stickers.  There was almost a huge fight between the two satellite companies.  The interns were getting yelled at.  And what was going on, Ben?  It was kind of like the old days of radio, though, wasn't it?  Yeah.  Where you get the two stations against each other.  Then our old company sent the K-Rock van to hang out, because the line was, I don't  know, all the way around the venue and down a few blocks, I'm hearing. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  So they sent the K-Rock van to get some exposure.  Did it bother?  Wait, whoa, whoa.  It must have interfered with the XM van.  What was the XM van?  See?  Wait a minute.  Well, what do you mean there's no XM van?  It's really funny.  I got to tell you.  2,500 fans.  I mean, rabid, money-spending fans.  What do you mean there was no XM van?  That doesn't make sense.  Well, see, this is the problem.  So, Washington gets on the phone with us every day and says, stop your bitching. 
[01:15:00]  Who's bitching?  They're really getting sick of us bitching.  Yeah.  But they give us something every day to bitch about.  Like, I don't understand that we would be at the Hammerstein Ballroom in our backyard  here in New York City, sold-out show, 2,500 people, and not even an XM Satellite Radio  van outside the venue.  This XM Satellite Radio van has our pictures on the side, but no one gets to see it because  it's in a lot down there in Washington, in the Washington compound.  In the compound.  And I'll get the call again today.  You guys bitched again. 
[01:15:30]  But I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  I don't get it.  Well, you got to give the touche to Sirius.  Sirius was there.  Brilliant move.  Sirius was there in full force.  It was a brilliant move on their part.  Man, did they...  Bitch slapping our interns and ripping down any type of banners that we could put up ourselves.  They had to darken.  They had to take a magic marker and scratch out the words, XM Satellite Radio on the IDs.  The IDs have pictures of Opie and Anthony, those cartoons, and it said, Passion of ONA  All Access, XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:16:00]  Black magic marker, because Sirius had co-sponsored part of the thing.  At last minute, this wasn't done all along, they just saw this opportunity and they took  it.  It was a great move.  It was like a scene out of the Warriors, wasn't it?  We couldn't walk through orphans' territory with our colors on.  Hey, sorry about that, XM.  And then we wanted to hand out these Opie and Anthony Wow stickers, and we couldn't do  it in the venue.  And there was no one there to push back on our side. 
[01:16:30]  No.  I mean, absolutely no one from Washington, right?  Did anyone come up for the show?  No.  From where?  Of course not.  But we're not supposed to bitch.  No, why wouldn't anybody?  So we got Sirius bitch-slapping our interns and everyone else associated with the show  and making sure they were going to kick people out if we didn't scratch out the XM Satellite  logo.  Yeah.  So then our interns had to take it to the street to hand out the stickers like a couple  blocks away or something crazy like that as the fans were...  We couldn't hand out XM, our Wow stickers.  We couldn't hand out our own Wow stickers at our show. 
[01:17:00]  How fucked up is that?  Well, and there was no one helping us out as far as this goes.  And I know I'm going to get the phone call.  They're going to blame Ben again.  Not Ben's fault.  Because Ben's the executive producer of the show, so for some reason they blame Ben for  everything.  I just don't get that.  Everyone knew that this show was going down.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  I just don't get it.  Yeah, I don't either.  You know, not only that, we weren't even allowed to wear the ONA XM shirts.  They made us put them inside out or else they were going to kick us out of the venue. 
[01:17:30]  See, how does that happen?  It's an embarrassment.  In the number one market in the country, it was an embarrassment.  Washington, hear us.  We got bitch slapped by the competition Saturday night in our backyard.  Thanks for the help.  We got bitch slapped.  And then I go, Ben, we could send a bunch of people out on stage in between the comedians  and we'll throw out some XM Satellite Radio shirts at least.  That'll be cool.  Wrong.  Ben goes, well, we have six shirts that we could give away.  Of six shirts, there's 2,500 lunatics here that would pretty much kill for an Opie and 
[01:18:00]  Anthony XM Satellite Radio t-shirt.  What do you mean six shirts?  Let me ask you, did you ask for shirts?  What happened?  Stuff came.  Stuff came.  We had boxes of stuff.  That's what came.  What boxes of what?  All the stuff went to the venue.  I mean, that's the stuff that's...  What stuff went to the venue?  Did we have shirts or not?  Yeah, yeah, we had shirts.  How many?  We had, like, how many shirts do we have?  Six shirts. 
[01:18:30]  Six shirts.  For the show, we had...  Well, I came here, you know, early in the day to try and get everything together.  It's six shirts.  And I saw six of them just hanging out.  I threw them in my bag.  I figured there was another box, so I tore the studio apart.  There's really not another box with, uh...  UPSA stickers.  Six.  We should have shirts.  Nah, six is good, though.  What's six in a 2,500?  That's one shirt every 400 and something people.  Maybe they could just put it on, take it off, give it to the next guy, put it on,  take it off, give it to the next guy.  That sounds fun.  A community shirt.  Sure.  We need 500 ONA fans there, and we got bitch slapped by the competition. 
[01:19:00]  Embarrassed.  We got embarrassed.  Anthony and I couldn't even leave the venue.  It took us two hours to get through our fans as far as taking pictures and autographs.  It was another perfect opportunity that was blown by the company, but we're not supposed  to bitch about things.  Well, it's funny.  I had a merchandise thing set up, and we had XM, you know, just XM, you know, stickers,  wow stickers by my shirt, because you didn't even have to go to eatabault.com for them.  You could have got them right there.  And they almost threw my merchandise guy out.  But Caroline's, actually, thank you to Lewis, came in and stuck up for me, because the venue 
[01:19:30]  was going to toss my merch guy for having stickers there.  Right.  All right.  Wow.  There you go.  That's today's bitch.  Make it.  And then even funnier was some of these guys got, like, assaulted by serious people.  Even funnier?  Again, you're trying that, Ben?  Damn it.  All right.  Well, let's see how funny this is.  He's prefacing it with it's funny.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  What happened?  They had a company girl there, a little blonde girl, who was just trying to get us out of  there any way she could.  At one point, she grabbed me by the shoulders and tried to manhandle me off the street. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that is even funnier, Ben.  You're right.  I'm sorry that I questioned you.  You've got to stop saying that expression.  Jim almost hit me for saying ASAP on Saturday night.  Not ASAP.  When you said it, you sounded like one.  All right.  Well, thanks, guys.  Well, you know, there's one more thing that happened.  During all the buckets, wasn't it funny?  Why don't you just pull the mic down instead of standing on your tippy toes?  Oh, look at you brave enough to just go on microphone.  All right.  Go ahead.  Actually, someone actually took Nathaniel the Intern's bag, and it could have been actually 
[01:20:30]  one of the serious people.  I'm not saying anything, but it was there, and then all of a sudden, it wasn't.  Are you calling them all thieving scum over there?  Is that what it is?  Yeah, actually.  What was in your bag?  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  This isn't funny.  My cell phone, a PDA, a voice recorder.  Yeah.  Yep.  Laugh at the hilarity.  And it was stolen?  Yes, it was.  Oh, wow. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, it was right next to all the wow stuff.  Now, that was one of our fans.  An over-eager fan got the mic.  Right now, there's a fan calling your ex-girlfriend, jerking you off as they say, hello, hello,  Nathaniel, hello.  Why did you?  One of the first time.  I figured if the first hello doesn't get a laugh.  Why would you leave something like that?  Keep going.  Yeah, it wasn't.  Hello?  Hello?  Well, maybe at five hellos, we'll get the chuck.  Nope.  All right, well.  Yeah, I don't understand how you leave something like that for somebody to just pillage. 
[01:21:30]  It wasn't the smartest thing I've done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just went outside for five seconds, put it next to the wow bag, wandered off to give  stickers, and then it was gone.  All right.  Well, the laugh track.  Thanks, guys.  The interns did a great job.  Great job.  Thanks, guys.  Fantastic.  They were unbelievable.  Oh, God.  But we're not supposed to bitch.  Who's bitching?  I'm not bitching.  I thought it was fine.  It was kind of cute.  It just amazes me.  Woof, woof.  We don't want to bitch.  We want to do a radio show, but this stuff is just, you're kidding, right?  You're kidding. 
[01:22:00]  Dude, I'm sure there's going to be plenty of stern events that XM is omnipresent at.  I'm sure that will happen.  You're kidding, right?  You can't just send the van at the least?  Why else did you get it painted with our faces on it?  All right.  And leave it in Washington.  Anthony, speaking of the old satellite thing, one of our bosses was on Cold Pizza.  We were watching it Friday, remember, as we were on the air?  Kevin Straley, and he was on with the gang at Cold Pizza on ESPN. 
[01:22:30]  What is Cold Pizza, for people that don't know?  It's a really weird, awful sports talk show.  Is it awful?  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  I've never seen it.  I saw it the day that Kevin was on when it was muted here in the studio.  I don't really know what they're trying to do with that show.  Is it a sports show, though?  Yeah, but it's a little bit of everything, but it's mainly sports.  But they do, like, they have roundtable about the football and all that stuff.  And then they were discussing... 
[01:23:00]  They were talking it was about sports talk.  On satellite radio?  No, sports talk on radio in general.  And they had, you know, Kevin there and someone from the other company there and then someone  from ESPN.  Right.  Well, we haven't heard this audio yet because we were on the air Friday.  So here's Kevin Straley on Cold Pizza on ESPN.  Or is it ESPN2?  ESPN2.  We better be ready to stop it.  Kevin, we'll start with you.  Why would folks...  Let me rephrase it.  What does XM offer to listeners that they can't get right now for free? 
[01:23:30]  That's a lot of options from XM Satellite Radio.  Specifically for sports, we offer NASCAR Radio, which is a 24 by 7 NASCAR channel.  If you think of WFAN, you think of baseball tonight, they're very focused on one sport.  We were the first to offer up a 24-7 sports channel with NASCAR, which offers all the  races, as well as talk and analysis around the races.  We also, coming in the spring, are going to offer up a 24 by 7 Major League Baseball channel.  Right.  So in addition to that, you know, we've got 13 play-by-play channels offering up content 
[01:24:00]  and a Hispanic play-by-play channel that has sports talk before the games and call-in  analysis after the games.  So almost narrow casting, very specific topics, and it is driving folks to go to Satellite  Radio.  That's right, it is.  24 by 7.  That was like...  Wow.  I've never heard it put that way.  That's the first time I've ever heard it put 24 by 7.  Is that a corporate thing also?  I believe so, yeah. 
[01:24:30]  They've adopted that.  That used to be a homie slang.  24-7.  24-7 was a homie slang, like years ago.  Yeah, well...  The brothers must be so pissed that white man takes everything.  That was phasing from my left ear to my right ear.  Yeah, I've kind of heard that myself.  I hope they're not having a problem out there in radio life.  That would make it interesting to listen to.  Can I ask a question about Straley?  Yeah.  How long has he had his hair cut like Forrest Gump?  I think that was his TV haircut.  Yeah, TV hair.  We saw him right after that interview, and his hair looked fine live. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  But on TV, yeah, it kind of had a...  It was almost like Forrest Gump meets Pee Wee Herman.  There was something going on in front a little bit.  You could tell that he knew he was going on ESPN, and he wanted to look nice, and he got  his TV haircut done.  That's all.  Yeah.  Here's the competition on cold pizza.  All right.  Interesting developments, Jay, with Howard Stern.  I believe it was on Wednesday's program he was talking about, and of course, Howard, you  pulled off a huge coup, and Howard is bringing his show to serious, I believe, in early 2006. 
[01:25:30]  2006.  Or my question to you is, is it going to be sooner?  Because on Wednesday's show, and I'd like to read this quote, Howard Stern said, quote,  a buddy of mine who shall remain nameless says Viacom is trying to get serious to pay  off my contract, and then I would leave early because serious is anxious to get the show  started.  Are you trying to buy him out of his contract with Viacom and get this thing going before  2006?  On the specific question, I have no comment on the, uh, would we really like to have him 
[01:26:00]  early?  Of course.  I mean, he's the quintessential broadcaster.  This man understands his audience.  He understands the business better probably than anybody who's doing it today.  And would we like to have him on the platform early?  Absolutely positively.  Now, are there talks going on at this point in time?  No comment on that.  You can read into that what you will.  And I don't want to put words in your mouth here, but would you be reading between the 
[01:26:30]  lines?  I think Howard's onto something here.  Oh, yeah, really?  Wait till you see what Viacom pulls.  I won't mention any names, but, um, yeah, yeah, they're trying to buy out my contract and  they're trying to, more conspiracy theories, more Howie conspiracy theories.  Viacom will, uh, will do all that when it makes sense to them.  Yeah.  When it makes sense for Viacom.  Exactly.  So then I think Kevin Straley, um, kind of stood up for us here.  Is there more of that on the horizon, uh, going out and signing the big shock jocks and, and 
[01:27:00]  some of the folks that are, that are out there looking to make this jump?  Will that happen?  Well, I mean, it's, it's, it's Bruce said, it's about talent and, you know, uh, unique  content is going to drive satellite radio as it drove, you know, cable television.  We signed Opie and Anthony, who are two personalities who, you know, from the younger set, you know,  they, they beat out Howard in afternoon drive or at least had similar ratings.  Yeah.  So they're kind of, they're, they're, they're the, um, the pioneers, uh, for satellite radio  in this giant, and there'll be more unique content that will come down the pike and that, 
[01:27:30]  uh, that's what's going to drive the format.  Kevin did good.  Great.  Pioneers.  There you go.  In the covered wagon as we make our way west, westward ho.  So, so, all right, we're going to take a break.  Wunderbar.  Kevin did well there.  He's very handsome.  I'll say.  He's a very skilled looking guy.  I'll say.  Okay.  Um, speaking of sports, Anthony, another clip that we finally got back.  Oh, which one is this? 
[01:28:00]  The Earl Weaver clip is one of our favorites of all time.  The old, uh, I guess he was, uh, with the Baltimore Orioles at this point.  And, uh, he was doing Coach's Corner.  Coach's Corner.  And, uh, obviously, I, he must have lost the game because he just loses his mind.  He was a little pissed off.  And this was live on the radio way, way, way long ago.  Check this out, and we'll return.  Now, the Manager's Corner.  With the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winningest manager, the Orioles' Earl Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's six best. 
[01:28:30]  Your area Oldsmobile dealers.  Anderson Olds.  Schaefer and Sturmanger Olds.  Lee Oldsmobile.  Metro Olds.  City Olds.  And Stuberger Olds.  And now, to the Manager's Corner with Earl Weaver.  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl, that certainly is an answer.  From, uh, Frederick Merriman, wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis, getting picked off, trying to steal, getting thrown out, taking runs away from you. 
[01:29:00]  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark, and you can't make any goddamn mistake.  Well, certainly, this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C. wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley as a designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings and enjoy watching a baseball game, just like any other fan, 
[01:29:30]  and has the ability to get up there and break one open in a fucking night.  So if this cocksucker didn't mind his own business and let me manage the fucking team, we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly, you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl, but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lane's coming from,  rather than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from. 
[01:30:00]  If she'd get her ass out to fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street,  she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Managers Corner.  Go fuck yourself and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball Fucking Network.  Now available on Norton Records, a heartwarming compilation.  A tribute to the mentally disadvantaged. 
[01:30:30]  It's Jim Norton duet.  Straight from the Opie and Anthony show, it's Jim Norton, a preschooler's keyboard, and a room full of retards.  Singing some of television's greatest hits.  Mister, we could use a hanger if your mother gets pregnant again.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Eat it.  He ran that one into the ground.  That'll be a promo. 
[01:31:00]  The game that was born on the radio now joins the next generation of radio.  XM Satellite Radio is now the official satellite service of Major League Baseball.

[01:32:00]  Now available in store.  I don't understand anything, so there you go.  You know my problem?  I watch too much news, man.  That's why I'm so depressed all the time.  I figured it out.  I watch too much CNN, man.  I don't know if you've ever sat around and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in one day.  I don't recommend that.  Watch CNN headline news for one hour.  It's the most depressing thing you'll ever fucking do.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless. 
[01:32:30]  Then you look out your window.  Where's all this shit happening?  Ted Turner's making this shit up, man.  Jane Fonda won't sleep with him.  He runs to a typewriter.  By 1992, we will all die of AIDS.  Read that on the air.  I don't get laid.  No one gets laid.  I'm writing, Jane Fonda. 
[01:33:00]  Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please?  I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast.  Hey, it's all going to work out.  Here's sports.  This is the nicest part of the South, for sure, man.  This is, like, the only part of the South you go, like, when I come there, nobody goes,  Man, I wish you could take me back to New York with you. 
[01:33:30]  You go to, like, Mississippi motherfuckers behind in your car and shit.  Shit, boy.  It's nice here.  Too hot, boy.  This ain't no place to be in, like, July.  Shit.  Get the fuck out of here, man.  It's hot every day, 90 degrees, and shit's, like, hotter than 10 niggas in a Volkswagen. 
[01:34:00]  This is Peter Kessler with today's XM Pure Golf Radio Minute.  England's Tony Jacklin was quite anxious to turn professional as early as possible, and he did.  My dad said, well, son, if that's what you want, that's it.  And January 1st, 1962, I turned pro, and I came along really quickly.  You know, I felt there was a lot inside me that I needed to get out, and I got as much experience as I could and played and quickly got myself out of the pro shop situation and the club making and playing some golf tournaments. 
[01:34:30]  And I played my first British Open in 63, and, you know, just sucked in all of that information and watched these great players that I had the opportunity to be around, asked if I didn't know the answer to anything, and was fortunate enough to do fairly well fairly early.  Join me tomorrow for another XM Pure Golf Radio Minute. 
[01:35:00]  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton's thing.  Forget me not, you sightless taut, your dog's your shit on my rug.  Thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  Cold-eyed bitch, just a kiss on her lips, said I was on my knees.  I'm waiting, yeah, man, ah.  She was shaking her hips, so that was all that I needed. 
[01:35:30]  Jets.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  On XM Satellite Radio.  The high-voltage channel, Anthony.  Right.  We love being on XM Satellite Radio.  You should know that.  But Anthony and I will continue to bitch until things are right.  That's all.  That's all we're saying.  Believe it or not, this mess of a radio show that you listen to every day has high standards. 
[01:36:00]  It does?  Yeah, when it comes down to getting everything right, of course it does.  We expect a lot.  We expect a lot from each other.  We expect a lot from the gang behind the scenes.  And we expect a lot from the company we work for.  As simple as that.  Right.  That's why we were on top.  Because we don't let anything slide.  Right before we screwed it up.  Right.  Well, yeah, then we screwed it up is right.  Well, they stopped showing the freaking 57-year-old mom that gave birth to twins.  Why are they still showing her? 
[01:36:30]  I don't know.  What happened?  The record's been broken already.  By the black lady.  You don't see the black lady going on ABC, Good Morning America, with Diane Sawyer, that hot piece of ass.  Ew.  Eesh.  I'd do her.  No, you wouldn't.  I swear to God, I would.  Yeah, I would.  She stinks.  I'd do her.  It's grandma.  Yeah, she has Martha Stewart hair.  She's awful.  All right, maybe she got a little long in the tooth the last couple of years since we've been off the air.  Yeah.  And they do use the soft lighting on Good Morning America to keep everyone looking young and fresh. 
[01:37:00]  They keep showing that woman.  I know.  She looks awful.  We were talking about this last week.  She was the oldest lady to give birth to twins, 57 years old.  She's white, so she's getting all this coverage all over America.  And in the paper on Friday, I think it was, there was this disgusting-looking black lady.  I'm sorry.  That's 59 from Georgia.  She's just not getting the attention.  Because let's be honest with each other here.  It's because she's black.  Yep.  Right.  That's the only reason I can see.  What a racist media we have. 
[01:37:30]  That's true.  I'll say.  All right.  Well, the big news was Friday, right?  A little audio here.  State of California versus Scott Peterson.  We, the jury, in the above entitled cause, find the defendant, Scott Lee Peterson, guilty of the crime of murder of Lacey Denise Peterson.  In violation of penal code section 187A, as a resident count one of the information filed herein.  Dated November 12th, year 2004, poor person number six. 
[01:38:00]  It gets boring from here, right?  Pretty much.  That's pretty much the verdict.  It's as they just read the first three charges, the murder and that it's first-degree murder and that he's found guilty of first-degree murder of Lacey and second-degree of the child.  Who was crying in the background?  One of his relatives or hers?  Peterson's mother.  Oh, the mothers always have to take it so hard.  It's kind of nice to see one of these end the right way. 
[01:38:30]  Well, I mean, these high-profile cases never end.  You mean like OJ?  OJ got off the hook?  All of them never end the right way.  Menendez brothers?  It's because we don't live in a racist country.  How did OJ get off the hook?  Jesus Christ.  I'm still trying to figure that one out.  It was like a hung jury for a while, right?  Yeah.  The jury went to the judge a while back when they first started deliberating.  Came back after a while and said, we cannot reach a decision.  We're deadlocked. 
[01:39:00]  There's a couple of sticks in the mud, I guess you'd call them, that wouldn't change their mind.  And the judge said, well, you go back and discuss this because I'm not going to declare a mistrial or a hung jury or anything.  So, deliberate.  Well, then, right after that, one juror is thrown off the case and an alternate is put in.  And all they said was she was conducting her own investigation into certain evidence, which you're not allowed to do.  They threw her off.  And they continued deliberating. 
[01:39:30]  They had to start all over again with the new juror.  They start deliberating again.  And then after a while, another jury gets thrown off.  And I didn't even hear what the reason was.  They didn't even give a reason.  They just said, another juror gone.  They bring in another alternate.  They have to start all over again with deliberations.  And then in really, relatively speaking, no time at all, they come back guilty.  So, I don't know what happened.  It seems like they got rid of the jurors that were kind of hanging in there and willing to give the guy a break.  And they threw them out and came back with a guilty verdict. 
[01:40:00]  So, I think they got plenty of grounds for appeal.  And, I don't know.  I don't think we've heard the last from Scott Peterson.  Probably not.  Nice to see that smug look wiped off his face.  He is an absolute jerk-off.  Am I awful because I kind of wanted the guy to get off the hook?  I love when things happen that are out of the ordinary.  The upset.  The big weird.  But that's never.  The OJ thing.  When they were not guilty.  And everyone just went, oh my god. 
[01:40:30]  And there's OJ.  Getting patted on the back by his buddies and everything.  That was a much better ending.  Not for the family or anything.  And a lot of people were pissed off.  I was pissed off.  But as far as.  Of Anthony.  The movie ending.  I was going to say, this is real life.  Yeah.  You're looking at this like, wow, this is a great mini-series.  And I was hoping it was going to end another way.  They televise it that way.  I want a good ending.  You're missing the point with Anthony.  He's rooting for guys who kill their wives.  Hmm.  You bring up a good point.  And they're unborn fetuses. 
[01:41:00]  Yes.  Back to you, Johnny.  I understand.  Well, so that's over with for now, right?  And how does he get, didn't he get convicted for murder of the fetus also?  Is that a law?  Well, this is the beauty of women's rights groups.  They were fighting that because they were trying to convict him for murder.  But these self-centered women's rights groups were saying, well, we don't know about that  because the minute you start to give a fetus rights, of course, it's their face.  It's going to chip away at Roe V.  You know, never about what's right or wrong. 
[01:41:30]  I don't know.  Nine months in.  I think if you're saying that the child is a child, that's got to be the law.  Now, then you wouldn't be able to have an abortion or anything.  But that's like saying if it was, I mean, technically it's right, but if it's born five minutes after it's born,  if he killed it, it'd be murder.  I mean, this is nine months in.  It just slips out of those beautiful labia.  Yeah, the second it really wrecks her for life and just denotes her to a minivan and soccer practice  and a bob haircut and stretch marked titties, the second that rotten little head does that, 
[01:42:00]  right, it's all of a sudden got legal protection.  Then it has legal protection, but before that, I don't know.  It depends.  I mean, if this was a third month pregnancy, but this was the ninth month, right?  I mean, she was ready to go.  Was it?  Yeah, it was close.  It was bad.  Bad news.  I should have thought it out a little earlier.  Two stiffs in the mud.  All right.  Also, Anthony, old dirty bastard died.  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  Leaving behind 13 children.  13 kids.  13 kids.  It's not, you know, you idiots, it's not the OD that we have on our radio show.  We try to make that clear a long time ago.  Our OD is different than old dirty bastard.  It's not old dirty bastard.  We have an old dirty.  Right.  He was old dirty bastard.  It looks like he dropped him a heart attack, right?  He was in a recording studio.  He was in the studio, had chest pains, and collapsed in the studio.  Leaving behind, yes.  13 children. 
[01:43:00]  I'd like to see.  Yeah.  Something's cooking in here.  Nice to see him busting apart those stereotypes, huh?  Just spreading that old dirty seed around every woman he was with.  And then the woman he was married to, I guess, has three kids with her, is coming out now  in the news.  I guess she's all busted up over the death, because the first thing she's coming out with  in the paper is, he don't really have all them kids.  Only three.  She's only claiming that he's the father of the three children she has, so that his estate 
[01:43:30]  will go to her and the three kids, and not be divvied up between ten other people.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  So old dirty bastard, dead.  All right.  More tragic news.  That story will continue, obviously.  And then, well, there's two more stories.  Stupid Star Jones finally got married, so thank God we don't have to listen to her.  I'm a lawyer.  Talk about her stupid wedding. 
[01:44:00]  What's her name now?  Star Jones Reynolds.  Star Jones Reynolds?  I'm Star Jones Reynolds.  Is she doing the hyphen thing?  I don't know what she's doing.  No, in the paper last week it said she's going to take the name of her husband.  Star Reynolds?  So it might just be Star Reynolds.  Star Reynolds.  She's a mess.  An absolute mess.  Awful fatso.  She had this big, sponsored wedding.  Like, everything in it.  She was auditioning companies to come in, makeup artists, clothing people, getting them  together a year before the wedding, and seeing if she wanted them as an official sponsor of 
[01:44:30]  her wedding.  No, she didn't even have to pay for this thing.  She gets out there, lost a little weight.  Yeah, you've got to give her that.  I would love to see if she failed completely and got into that wedding dress, that big  fat cow she's been for her whole life.  But she dropped a few pounds.  But watch.  Let's keep your eye on Star now.  The wedding's over.  She's married.  I say bigger than she was before.  I say within six months. 
[01:45:00]  Ooh, she's going to start eating.  Unless she had her stomach stapled.  A lot of people say she might have had her stomach stapled.  Should have a kitchen stapled.  And then finally, Anthony, I guess we're doing a little news segment here.  I don't know.  This was the story of the weekend.  God, you've got to love this guy.  Naked man jumps into the Bronx Zoo crock pit.  A man who was undergoing psychiatric evaluation after he jumped naked into a pool of reptiles 
[01:45:30]  at the Bronx Zoo.  The episode happened at about 1.30 Friday afternoon when the man, whose name was not  released, stripped off his clothes and climbed a five-foot wall surrounding the zoo's tank  of alligators.  The tank was inside the zoo's World of Darkness section, which features nocturnal animals,  Anthony.  I've been there.  Where is it?  Bronx Zoo.  I thought the World of Darkness was the surrounding neighborhood.  Well, it is pretty amazing that that zoo is in the middle of a ghetto like that. 
[01:46:00]  But he tried to touch one of the toothy lizards before police and zoo keepers were called to  the scene and pulled them out.  Naked with the alligators.  Crazy people love getting naked.  They just love getting naked.  But then finding wild animals, jumping in and toying with them.  Right.  Thankfully, no one got hurt, and it didn't happen while there were any school groups  around, the zoo spokesman said.  Yeah, you want your little tot to see that.  It was not clear why the man jumped into the tank.  He was taken to... 
[01:46:30]  He was crazy.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why he did it.  What do they mean, thankfully no one was hurt?  How great would it be if he had his throat torn out and saved his state a lot of money?  Oh, that would have been awesome.  A crocodile grabs him, does that death roll they do.  The one thing I don't get about the zoo thing, and there's a story in the news a couple  times a year, easily.  You get some stupid, idiot, fat tourist that has to toy with the lions or something, think  they're the cool ones, and they take a stick and they kind of point it at the lion, and  the lion sort of gets lucky and grabs hold of the stick, then their arm, and then 
[01:47:00]  rips their arm off or rips the coat off.  You ever see the video of the coat?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Polar bear.  Was it a polar bear where the polar bear's ripping at the coat and she's slammed against  the railing, the cage?  Oh, that one's true.  And she can't get out of the coat because it's now tight around her and she's screaming  Bloody Mary?  You can't get out of your coat, you dumb...  But what I don't get, after the episode is done, they always have to go and kill...  And I'm not an animal rights activist.  Trust me, I'm not. 
[01:47:30]  But why do they have to go and kill these animals for doing what they're supposed to  do?  Yeah, I know.  I mean, we're the stupid ones, the stupid humans that have to toy with these things.  Stupid human.  And if the person dies or gets maimed, then they have to go in and kill the damn thing.  Kill the animal.  Kill the stupid fat lady for being dumb.  Easy, tree hugger.  I'm not, though.  But it just bothers me.  You see, recently, a couple weeks back, I guess it was, some Asian guy jumped in with  lions.  No, where was that?  He jumped in with, I don't know, it might have been Taipei or something. 
[01:48:00]  One of these Asian zoos.  And he jumped into a cage of lions trying to convert them to Christianity.  He was breeding religious...  Wow!  ...to the lions.  Yeah, that's a kook.  This lion, they had some great pictures of it.  Lunges at him, takes that big lion paw, and just smacked him.  Put him right down.  And then starts mauling him a little bit, you know, teeth.  Did he die?  No!  The guy hung in there. 
[01:48:30]  Annoyed the crap out of me, too.  I see how pissed off you are that he's still alive.  Well, the lion smacked him because he looked at his emotionless face and thought it was  a mannequin.  He said, why is this mannequin talking?  He had the same look when he was reading the religious stuff to when he was being attacked  two hours later when he was eating ice cream.  Did you ever see the clip of the...  They always play this one on When Animals Attack on Fox.  It's a bear with a muzzle on, and the bear trainer sits the bear down in a chair, and 
[01:49:00]  there's a woman sitting next to the bear.  And the woman goes to look up at the bear, and she's got this big smile on her face.  And the bear just kicks the shit out of this woman.  Swats her?  Swats her!  And that stupid smile on her face turns to complete horror in a split second, and you  can just watch it over and over again.  He just trounces her.  Trounces her.  Won't get off of her.  Starts bouncing up and down on her.  If he didn't have the muzzle, her throat would just be gone. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Those are definitely the best videos to check out.  Let's say hi to Justin in Massachusetts.  Congrats on the Pats there, Justin.  What's up, guys?  Beating the Bills last night, 29-6.  Who cares?  That's awesome.  All right, what's up, man?  I just wanted to comment on that guy in the Bronx Zoo.  If his friend was trying to talk him out of jumping, would that be croc-blocking?  Very good.  That's not bad.  You should have said, I have something funny before you said that, though.  That was good.  All right, thank you.  You guys suck. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Thank you.  We interrupt this program for the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day, Anthony.  Ozone's Midget Sighting of the Day.  It's Billy in Long Island.  We're on Long Island.  What's up, Billy?  How you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I played Texas Hold'em with a two-foot dwarf on Friday night.  Really?  Texas Hold'em.  Well, now, what's the difference between a dwarf and a midget?  Well, from what I understand, the dwarf has the regular-sized head.  Yeah.  His head was bigger than mine.  No, the dwarf has the kind of elongated head. 
[01:50:30]  A midget looks just like a real person, only shrunk.  And a dwarf has those weird limbs and head.  Let me tell you, man, there was nothing better than seeing these little toe fingers grasping  at the cars, throwing the chips in.  Trying to rake a pot in with those little fingers.  Hey, he was the short stack the whole game, huh?  And that's all the guys there.  We're calling him Stacks.  Stacks?  Stacks.  That's his nickname around there.  Oh, that's great.  He must love being called Stacks.  With his little feet poking straight out from the chair. 
[01:51:00]  Sitting on a phone booth.  That's a little off-office.  Sitting on a phone booth.  Boy, you must have been really tall sitting on that phone booth at the table, Jim.  I suck.  Little cauliflower ears.  All right.  Thank you, Billy.  Sitting on a phone cord.  What an asshole I am.  Sitting on a cell phone.  This concludes the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Thank you. 
[01:51:30]  Who's going to be the guy that wrecks the midget sighting of the day, Ben?  Somebody will.  There's going to be some idiot that just wrecks the bit, and then it's going to have to go away.  How could the bit be wrecked, do you think?  I don't know.  So far, everyone that has called in with their midget sightings, they just know what they're doing.  Good midget sightings.  Hey, Ben, why aren't you wearing Nicholson's sweater from The Shining?  He's got a dapper turtleneck on.  Right after you look at him in that turtleneck, a thing should come on that went, Tuesday.  We're going to be abusing you in a little while, man. 
[01:52:00]  What?  For this book you brought in.  What's wrong with the book I brought in?  Oh, speaking of books, by the way.  Yeah.  Caught stealing Friday after you guys left.  Old Dirty.  Caught stealing.  Come on.  Really?  I swear to God.  He tried to steal some books, and he was so hammered because he was doing Jägermeister,  and he walked out, and he just ... The funniest thing was, he's like, I don't know where that  came from.  I don't know where that came from.  That's all he kept telling Paul.  He had a couple books.  He had the 9-11 hearing book.  I don't know where the hell he found that, and a couple other books.  O.D. was so drunk when I left. 
[01:52:30]  He had been hitting that Jäger machine toward the end of his appearance on the show.  I saw him do six shots.  About six shots here in the studio.  Did you notice during the show, after he left the studio and we continued doing the show,  that you kept hearing, brrrr, the Jäger machine going?  Yeah.  He kept coming in, using it, doing a shot, going out, coming back in.  He was hammered.  When I got off, we went out to talk to those two young gentlemen that came in to visit the  show.  I remember.  And old Dirty's sitting there, hammered.  He tried to talk to me about something, and it was just Jäger breath and babble that 
[01:53:00]  was coming out of his mouth.  He did great, though.  We're going to have to have him back.  Oh, yeah.  Well, he didn't recognize they were books.  He just saw these things.  He's like, yo, I can sit on these, B.  This guy used to, what is this story about?  Let's say how to Bob the Trucker.  Bob?  Yeah.  How's it going, Opie and Anthony?  Where are you hauling to?  I'm sorry.  Come again on here?  Where are you hauling to? 
[01:53:30]  I'm going to Niagara Falls and delivering a load of boilers up there.  Oh, that's a lot of fun.  Oh, yeah.  But the guy can't unload me today, so I'm going to go check out the falls.  Anyways, I've got a story for you guys.  Check out the casinos up there.  Is there good casinos up there?  Oh, I went, Opie goes, you've got to check out the falls when we were up in Buffalo.  We were driving from Cleveland.  I thought it would be a nice little thing for you and your lady to do.  I'm like, we're going from Cleveland to Buffalo on our promotional tour.  I'm like, ah, if you've never seen it, go see Niagara Falls, Anthony.  I'm thinking Anthony's going to spend the whole night, maybe do dinner next to the falls, 
[01:54:00]  and maybe do some sightseeing, the Maid of the Mist, where the boat goes nice and close  to the actual falls.  You have to put your rain slicker on.  Put on your rubber.  You know?  But no, you what?  You drove by it?  No, no.  Did you do a drive-by?  One of the seven wonders of the world?  Did you just do a drive-by?  We went to a drive-by, we stopped in the parking lot, got out, walked up to the rail, took  a look, got a little wind change direction, got a little mist, like, ooh, that's nice.  And then I turned around and looked up and I saw a big thing, casino. 
[01:54:30]  And I went, oh, man.  All right.  And for the next 20 hours.  I think it was 20 hours.  I was sitting at a blackjack table.  There was a point we didn't think you were going to make it to the Buffalo appearance.  And then I was just a wreck for the whole appearance.  Yeah, yeah.  The stupid tap beers.  God, I hate tap beer.  I need a bottle.  I felt like shit the next day.  Did you stay there at the casino?  Oh, hell yeah.  I was there, like, forever.  Wouldn't leave.  Sorry I interrupted you.  He's ready to say something funny. 
[01:55:00]  I interrupted on a pointless fucking logistics question.  Yes, I stayed there.  Do you need the...  He didn't stay in a room, though.  He stayed at the tables for 20 straight hours.  I actually meant that he stayed in the room.  I don't know why.  I just was...  I get curious about people's trips.  Like, well, how was it?  What did you do?  Yeah, how was the room?  Room service?  Yeah.  No, it was...  I'm crazy with casinos.  I love casinos.  I love the sound of them.  I like the action, the adrenaline rush when you have a good hand there.  I hate losing.  I'll crank you when I lose.  Oh, I wish you guys...  I wish you guys wouldn't have said that because my credit card's paid off now. 
[01:55:30]  I can go up there and get all that.  Hey, they make it easy to get money.  Well, Bob, what do you have for the show there?  You know, you guys were talking about those people who like to tease the lions and shit,  you know, in the zoos and stuff.  Yeah.  I served a little time in jail.  It was like a month or something like that.  Every trucker.  Every trucker's got a shady pass.  He's been in jail.  Why were you in jail for a month?  It was a DUI.  A DUI?  A DUI?  A DUI.  A DUI.  Yeah.  A DUI.  All right.  Well, that's fine when you're hauling boilers. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, no, no.  That's going to make me safe next time I'm on the road and I hear...  ...behind me.  Great.  Yeah, go ahead there.  So you spent a little time in jail.  No big deal.  Yeah.  And since it wasn't a violent crime...  Hey, hey, hold on.  Hold on.  Hey, dude.  I really don't think they give you jail the first DUI.  No, this was...  Yeah.  How many?  All right.  We're on to them.  Well, it's on to you.  How many, my friend?  I was ready to let it slide. 
[01:56:30]  I'm sorry.  What?  How many DUIs?  I had two.  Only two?  Yeah, only two.  Swear to God, it was only two.  Ah, you're a rookie.  And the second time, yeah, I refused to do their classes and all that shit because I just didn't want to do it.  And I couldn't get myself there because they took away my license.  So I just went in and told the judge, you know, hey, well, just send me to jail on the fine, you know, and I'll pay it off that way.  So anyways, I was in there 30 days.  And since I wasn't in for a violent crime or a felony like drugs, meth or anything like that, they let me be a trustee. 
[01:57:00]  And I worked my way into receiving trustees.  So I was a guy that held the sign in front of you, you know, and took your picture.  And they had the rubber rooms right down the hallway from where they put the psychos and stuff in there.  And they had this glass, real thick glass that went by.  And the only way to get to the bathroom was walk past the psycho room.  So I'd go by there and I'd flip them off, you know, and make faces at them and shit so they'd get psycho and start beating on the glass and get all angry and yelling and shit.  And then I'd walk past the deputies and act like, I don't know what he's mad about. 
[01:57:30]  You know, and they'd go in there and just kick the living shit out of them.  You'd hear them in there yelling and screaming and then just go silent.  Oh, what a meanie.  Did anybody try to sexually assault you in jail or beat you up?  Did who?  Did anybody bother you?  No, no, man.  That means you're at least 6'4 and 250.  You know, when I'm 6'2, 40.  Hey, dude.  Yeah, that's why they're not messing with you. 
[01:58:00]  When I left, when I finally got out, though, I kind of missed that job.  I wanted to stay there just so I could fuck with them guys.  Drink a little more.  Drink and drive.  I had a...  All right.  I think...  Bobby!  Give us a toot.  We're out of here.  All right.  They're going to go.  Later on, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  They love talking.  They love talking.  The truckers are all...  You know, it's amazing because we were told before we even hit the air, you're going to  get a lot of truckers listening because they got the satellite and they love to talk. 
[01:58:30]  Well, they're lonely.  You've got to cut them off.  They're lonely.  You've always got to cut them off.  Here's what the truckers are saying.  They're lonely.  They're lonely.  All right.  Let's say hi to Club Soda Kenny.  Oh, good.  Kenny, great job the other night.  No.  You guys did a great job.  Ah.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you very much.  Who's better than you guys?  You.  Club Soda Kenny.  Let me tell you something.  I woke up.  I heard you talking about the news.  The biggest news of the weekend was that show. 
[01:59:00]  It sure was.  Sold out.  Hammerstein Ballroom, 2,500 strong.  Thousands of people went home satisfied and leaking clear stuff.  And they had Norton's merchandise, too, man.  Oh, man, do they have his merchandise.  And Norton and Voss killed selling merchandise.  Yes.  Norton more than Voss.  Voss did good, though.  He did all right.  Considering he only has two items.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  And, Kenny, thank you for putting everyone at ease.  Well, you know, I try to do my best. 
[01:59:30]  Anthony and I get on the stage, do a little sound check.  It's completely empty.  Yeah.  We got a little pre-show jitters happening.  So we told Kenny to do some skipping for us because it's always fun to see a 6'5 monster  skipping up and down the aisles.  He was skipping.  And the whole place, even the tough teamsters that don't crack a smile.  You got them going, too, man.  Well, I am multi-talented.  Yes, you are.  6'4 muscular man with a pistol strapped to him skipping up and down the aisle happily. 
[02:00:00]  Listen, did you guys talk about the show yet?  All the nakedness, all the craziness?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, we covered all that.  Yeah, we talked about the skankos that helped us start the show.  Actually, the video was a huge hit with the Team Boyer bus footage.  And we have thousands of hours of video that we just have to do something with from our old show.  Yeah, we got to figure it out.  Somebody's got to figure that out.  I mean, we want to maybe put out a series of DVDs maybe called Shock Jocks Gone Wild or something.  Gone Wild.  Something.  Sell it late night.  This thing would sell like crazy. 
[02:00:30]  The stuff we got on video, it's insane.  That video was on the money.  Yo.  It was good.  We talked about my cab ride over.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sorry about that.  Not your fault.  Not your fault.  I want to thank Jeff from foundrymusic.com for putting the video together.  Kenny, what else do you want to say about the show?  We kind of covered it all, unless you got something.  I just wanted to call and remind everybody how terrific you guys are.  Oh, thanks, Kenny.  Because I am enamored with you. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, thank you so much.  That's all.  I just called to say hello and thank you.  And you did a great job.  And keep up the good work.  And I just got a little nuts when you talked about midgets before.  And thanks for being a true friend of the show.  We don't have many.  And you're one of them, Kenny.  I hear you.  Just want to say that.  Okay?  All right, buddy.  I'll see you guys later.  All right.  Bye, sweetie.  Take care.  There's a lot of rumors going around, and we're trying to get to the bottom of it.  But I don't know, man. 
[02:01:30]  I don't think Anthony cares as much, which is fine.  But I just want just a little loyalty.  I just ask for a little loyalty as far as the people that are associated with this radio show.  Jim Norton showed unbelievable loyalty when we were gone for two years.  Rich Voss, unbelievable loyalty.  They could have went on other radio shows and stuff like that.  They chose not to because they know what we have, and they know what Anthony and I have given them.  And it's kind of nice to see. 
[02:02:00]  But I'm starting to hear things about some of the people that used to do our old show.  And it's kind of a bummer, actually.  Like who?  Well, Dice was in town, and he doesn't even call or stop in.  And we had him booked on the show, and then it became a whole soap opera that he wanted to talk to me before he came on the show.  So I called him and left a message, and then he never called me back.  And then he was talking to other people that will remain nameless.  And it was like a whole soap opera.  We didn't get what was going on.  Then I'm here, and he's trying to go on someone else's show, which shows, I don't know, shows his desperation, to be honest with you. 
[02:02:30]  Well, we always knew that.  No, you know, I was hoping that it was different, but I'm not surprised, you know.  But we're trying to get to the bottom of it before we give you all the details.  But it's like, what is he doing?  You know, he's done some unbelievable radio with us, great radio with us.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  A lot of people were counting on him being on the show last week, and he was in town doing some shows, and I guess they did well. 
[02:03:00]  I don't know.  And he doesn't even call in or anything.  He even promoted it and everything.  Said he was going to be on.  Right.  And then we're up in the air about Louis.  Louis Black, yeah.  What's up with that?  Louis Black, great friend of the show.  We've been trying to get him on, especially with the election that just passed.  He would have been a perfect guess.  Maybe he doesn't want to get arrested again.  He was one of the 15 people arrested with the Teen Voyeur bus thing.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I don't know what's going on there either.  And we hear spring.  Springtime will be available. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, we finally got a hold of his handlers, and I think maybe Louis is getting a little big now.  He's got a book to plug in spring if he can do your show.  Yeah, they're telling us he'll come back in the spring when the book comes out.  And that's not the Louis we know.  Louis would just walk down the street, stop in, and say hi.  Yep.  What's going on with these people?  I don't know.  I haven't seen him in a while, so I don't know.  No?  Nah.  He doesn't do that.  You know, occasionally I bump into him here and there, and he's always cool, but I haven't  seen him in a while.  I'm not saying he's in a lot of the same clubs.  He lives a block from me.  Louis lives like four buildings away from me, and I never see him. 
[02:04:00]  I'm not saying he's not cool.  You know, it's just kind of weird, though.  Yeah.  Anybody that doesn't, any comic especially, doesn't show loyalty to you guys, you should  just spit in their face.  I don't care who they are, and move on.  There's no reason that I could do it or Voss could do it.  And I'm not saying you can't go on other shows and promote your stuff.  I mean, you've got to make a living.  I mean, this can mean you've got to plug, but you understand, there's a vibe there.  You know, well, they're not big enough yet, or they just came back, so I'll wait.  After all, we are not communists.  Exactly.  It's not...  In my neighborhood, we would keep it with the shock jocks.  See, Anthony and I are different here. 
[02:04:30]  We understand you guys have got to go on other shows.  We totally get that and always have, but there's going on other shows, and then there's going  on other shows, and that's what we're getting at.  You know?  That's the loyalty we're looking for a little bit.  But then when people start waiting for you guys to get the...  Well, let's wait until they're on for a year until their audience is built back up.  Well, the audience is growing every day.  I'm saying that's the thinking.  And we're quite happy with the amount of people listening to this brand new show, but we're  nowhere near where we're going to be a year from now.  We know that.  And some people want to wait. 
[02:05:00]  I guess.  Well, it seems that way, and anyone that wants to wait, you should spit in their face, because  no guest is worth that much.  I'll tell you this.  I thought, stupid me, that Dice came on the show because he had fun doing the radio show  with us, and then it was almost like, and if he sells tickets and merchandise, great.  That's great, too.  Obviously, that goes with it a little bit.  But we have so many guys that stop by just because they want to hang and have fun.  I think it was all about just selling tickets with Dice.  Yeah?  I think so.  I really don't...  I don't think there was that personal of a relationship there. 
[02:05:30]  That's what I think.  Oh, really?  You know how many stupid phone calls I took in the middle of the night and listened to  him talk for two straight hours?  Well, I think that all was a part of it.  You think?  Yeah.  That's a bummer, then.  I think it was.  And then all of a sudden, we get thrown off the air.  We come back.  We're building an audience.  Right.  Maybe not now.  All right.  Mike on Long Island, he writes, are you guys putting that video footage on ona.com?  I was in the balcony, and I couldn't see the screen. 
[02:06:00]  OpianAnthony.com.  Is Steve going to get all that up and running on OpianAnthony.com, the videos that we made,  that we played in between the comedians?  Yeah?  All right.  Cool.  That would be great.  So I guess, you know, we'll have to wait and see on the whole Dice situation.  But he was here, and now he's gone, and he doesn't even call to say hi.  Didn't even call.  Well, that's what we got.  You know, Brewer is doing his own thing these days, but he still calls me.  He wants to do our show still.  I don't see how that's going to happen.  I don't know.  He thinks he can make it happen, so we'll have to wait and see. 
[02:06:30]  Because we do great radio with Brewer.  Brewer is so stoned, I think he just assumes that he can make it happen.  Man, peace in the whole world, man.  I'm going to do it.  No, I don't think you're going to pull that one off.  No.  But if Brewer can't, you know, it's a logistics thing that's not his fault.  Right.  But he wants to.  I mean, what a great little tribute he gave you guys when he walked out.  I mean, you know what I mean?  I know.  Spoke very highly.  The guy said nothing but good things.  He was so stoned.  He's the greatest.  The guy comes up into the dressing room, and he's just like, hey, man, how you doing? 
[02:07:00]  Like, good.  He goes, hey, I'll be back.  I just want to go, you know, smoke a little bit.  And he was off.  That was it.  Then I didn't see him until stage.  And I know I spoke to Pete, who had just spoken to him in his dressing room.  He came into our dressing room, Pete, smelling like he had just smoked a pound of weed.  And he was just hanging out in the room with Brewer. 
[02:07:30]  Anyone that hangs around, even next to Brewer, winds up smelling like weed.  You get the contact buzz.  I don't have my coffee.  The guy loves his pot.  Loves his pot.  All right.  And Pete doesn't do drugs.  No.  Do you got to...  I left my copy home, I think.  No, I left it home.  You got another one?  Of what?  Rent Boys?  Yeah, we'll talk about...  We'll talk about...  You left your copy at home, Opie?  No, no.  Trust me.  No, no.  Don't start that crap. 
[02:08:00]  What?  I'm at dinner, and Norton talks about this book, Rent Boys.  I'm like, what is wrong with...  Save it.  I will save it.  Sure.  I want to know everything, though.  I want to know how you got it, how you found out about it, why you have a copy.  And then you got to hear what he wants us to do, as well.  You can get...  Take that out.  Take that out.  Anthony, the show getting more gooder every day as we...  You know, when we were kicked to the curb a little over two years ago, we weren't able  to bring anything with us.  Nope.  Except for, you know, a little, like, our little plants that we had in the office and 
[02:08:30]  little, like, cute Ziggy cartoons, you know, that type of crap.  But all our material had to be left behind.  Gone.  Gone.  So we're slowly but surely getting all this stuff back, and who sent this in?  Or did you just get it?  I had it.  Oh, okay.  Eric, Sex Bagel had this, Anthony.  Oh.  It's one of our favorites from the old show, Total Recalling.  Now Arnold is the governor.  The governor of California.  I don't know if that was a burp or...  I don't know what the hell was on there.  It's like an acid reflux burp. 
[02:09:00]  It was weird.  So we got Total Recalling back, Anthony.  Yes.  This thing just makes us laugh silly.  I don't know why.  I like the bad impression, and I like the lyrics.  Okay.  I've been dreaming of going to Mars, where mutants drive plastic cars. 
[02:09:30]  So I go there, you know the rest.  The best part is the girl with three breasts.  Total Recalling.  Dillon.  Recalling.  Total Recalling.  So I'm on Mars, and I meet Queto, and I pull this big metallic thing out of my nose. 
[02:10:00]  It makes me scream, it makes me scream, and shout, and move my big robotic head all about. 
[02:10:30]  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Recalling.  Recalling.  See you at the party, Victor.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  One more time, fellas.  Total Recalling.  Total Recalling.  I'm going to start falling. 
[02:11:00]  I'm so sad, I can't screw Sharon Stone.  And Macaulay Culkin was left home all alone  AHHHHHH  TOTA RICK  TOTA RICK  TOTA RICK  TOTA RICK  TOTA RICK  Johnny, give me the bass  You're not, you don't, you got to slap it a little harder  Give me the bass 
[02:11:30]  Alright  Okay  I don't think it's in tune  Cause I, I don't know, the fingering  It's not working  Johnny, grab my hand  Grab, grab your bass

[02:15:30]  XM 202  XM News  Talk  Sports  And Information  It's everything  All the time  Staring at my shoes  Trying to think of something  The O.B. and Anthony Show  It's a freak show!  The O.B. and Anthony Show  The O.B. and Anthony Show  Oh, Black Betty  Bambalam 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, Black Betty  Bambalam  Black Betty  Bambalam  Bambalam  Bambalam  Bambalam  Bambalam  Bambalam  Bambalam  Black Betty  Bambalam  Yeah, Black Betty  Bambalam  Spiderbait  The old Ram Jam song, Black Betty  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show  Thanks for checking us out today  I lost my internet connection  On one of my many computers over here  Sweetie! 
[02:16:30]  I have my backup up  But all my favorites are on my other one  This is the most amazing radio studio I've ever seen in my life  Yeah  I want to thank the folks at XM Sally Radio for building this for us  It's like the bridge of the enterprise  It really is  Ashton Kutcher has got to calm the F down  Why?  He starts all the trends in Hollywood, Opie  Stop it  He started the trucker hat trend, right?  He pretty much bought that  Von Dutch  Ben, you don't agree with him starting the trucker hat 
[02:17:00]  I don't know if he started it  And I hate those Von Dutch  Can anybody get an original one wear or something different?  Awful Von Dutch  I like trucker hats though  But no, I don't know if he started it  I don't know  But I mean he was probably one of the more favorites  You're probably right  I mean he probably made it pretty big  But...  Who started the ribbon trend?  And what the hell does it mean on the cars?  What's that?  Oh, the cars?  I don't know what it means  It says support the troops, which is fine  I'm all for supporting the troops  It's the old yellow ribbon thing  Yeah, but...  Do you pay for that?  And then the money goes to the troops' families? 
[02:17:30]  Oh, stop  How are we supporting the troops by putting ribbons on our car?  You're telling people  Through your decorative stick-on  That you're supporting the troops  If you want to support the troops  You know, grab an AK  And then jump on the next flight to Fallujah  That's how I think you should support the troops  Be like little Jimmy Norton  Get on a C-130 and give him some chuckles  It's funny, I was arguing with some liberal comedian  We were having just a big blowout  Liberal comedian, wow  Yeah, I know  Really surprising to find those in show business  What are the odds? 
[02:18:00]  98%  And, of course, we're arguing about Bush and Kerry  And he starts getting personal  And I'm just talking about how, you know  I don't think Bush has to do it  He's like, what have you done?  Like, I haven't done anything  He's like, what have you done?  You're for the war?  And I'm like, well, I did go over there  And stand in a war zone and entertain troops  How about you, douchebag?  What did he do?  Nothing  Nothing  Sat there with his head that's too small for his body  And pontificated paternalistic drivel  Paternalistic drivel like the rest of the left does  Paternalistic  Drivel  Drivel  You were over there in harm's way, as they say 
[02:18:30]  I'll say I was  Landing at Baghdad airport  Yeah, we were in Baghdad  We were in Krakuk, Talil  We had to make an emergency landing in Balad  Why?  Because we were coming down into  No, I'm sorry, not Balad, Mosul  We were supposed to go into Balad  Were you in first class at the time?  Oh my god  Yeah, yeah, yeah, which was the uh  Which was the second seat in the cargo hull  We um  No, me and Colin were in the cockpit  And we're coming in for a landing in uh, Balad  I didn't know if Colin could fly a C-130  Oh, he couldn't  He just sat there with his dress on like I did  Watching men do men's work 
[02:19:00]  And uh, the fog was so bad in Balad  We were a hundred feet off the runway  They couldn't see the runway  Did you really think maybe you might die doing this?  Because you ain't flying to begin with  And now you're flying into Iraq  During the trip  During the trip  The whole way there  Until you got back  Did you think that I probably won't come home from this?  Of the time, not really  I felt very secure  Our base did get hit with a mortar attack  While we were sleeping  Um  No, we actually left the base to do a show 
[02:19:30]  We came back  They said they had been on the ground for an hour  Because there was a mortar attack on the base  But no, the only time I felt vulnerable  Is when we were flying  Uh, because they have guys looking out the windows  To make sure no RPGs are fired up at you when you take off  Nice  And uh, when you're coming in for landings  It was a little bit uh, scary  And commercially  Uh, we had a two hour wait  Didn't they have to do some maneuvers too?  Combat maneuvers for the landing, yeah  Which means  That's something you don't get on your normal flight on Continental  You don't know the rush you feel when you're just dropping  Because they're doing all these weird drops and sharp dips  Uh, to make it a harder target to shoot down 
[02:20:00]  Hard to hit  Now in a regular commercial airline  Their rate of descent is so slow  Yeah  Yeah  And it's for the comfort  The plane can handle it  But the comfort of the passengers  They bring you in nice and slow  Uh, in this thing  They don't want a nice slow target  So they drop you in altitude really quickly  Banking right  I mean a hard  And you're turning back and forth  Hard bank  Were you nauseous?  I thought I was going to vomit on myself  I actually, it was worse in the cockpit  It wasn't as bad when you flew in the back 
[02:20:30]  Uh, we did get to fly  Cool thing  We got diverted to Mosul  We had no way to get to Baghdad  We were going to do shows in Balad  They got canceled  Oh, let's go to Baghdad  And do a New Year's Eve show  So we got to fly with General Ricardo Sanchez  Oh  The guy running the whole show in Iraq  The big muckety muck  Yeah, yeah, yeah  We got to fly in his plane with his Delta Force bodyguards  And that was really cool  He came to the show  Wow  Yeah, I got shots with him  And you got to see the look on his face  Say pictures in that situation  You're right  I really don't understand if it's shots or pictures  I got pictures  Unbelievable  And of course Colin is so ballsy  He goes on stage 
[02:21:00]  And just starts making fun of Sanchez for being Spanish  And doing box card jokes  I've never seen bigger balls on a comedian  He made fun of the commander in chief in Iraq  While he was there  Ah, Colin  Yeah  Wow  It was great man  That sounds like very dangerous though  I got photos on Saddam's toilet  Holding his  We got to hang out with these green berets that are occupying one of his  That's unbelievable  Dude, one of the guys we hung out with was the third guy on the ground in Afghanistan  This is October of 2002  After we got hit in 9-11 
[02:21:30]  Third guy on the ground  Really?  They were going over there  He speaks Russian  All these like really secret black ops guys  They were great  Technically they're not supposed to be over there  Like you can't put our faces on websites  You can't mention our names  So how did Saddam's toilet feel?  On your butt?  Like any other toilet would feel  Yeah  I think I sat on the bidet in Collins  Wait, so you walked through one of his  Did you see any thick pubic hairs on the toilet rim?  Did you walk through his palace?  Two of them  So what did you see?  Was there anything cool?  Well  Like porno or like blockbuster videos? 
[02:22:00]  Anything like that?  Yeah  Obviously not blockbuster  Yeah the hot video  The clitoral circumcision comedy  Selling Julia Roberts  No, it was all these big pallets full of stuff  Because the military uses them  But they are as decadent  The green beret colonel was showing us around in the one place  And he showed us this mural on the wall  Of all these surrendering Americans that Saddam had  Really?  Like when he was telling people that we lost  Yeah it was great  His swimming pool  His indoor swimming pool  We could have swam in  Absolute marble decadence  It was fantastic 
[02:22:30]  Yeah  I got photos I'll show you guys  And there was his people just starving and being tortured  Yeah  And there he is in his golden palace  Nice  Mammoth  What a way to live  That's great  Yeah  He should have just calmed the fuck down  Yeah come on in  He had it made  Yep  What is he stupid?  He ruled with an iron fist over his people  If you just leave it at that  You'd have been fine  We got driven by on the way to one of his palaces  The guy  These special forces soldiers that were taken  Showed us where his old place used to be 
[02:23:00]  Where he kept animals  And like right back there is where he kept lions and tigers  And what he would do is either political dissidents  Or women  Him and the sons  Uda and Kuse would rape women  And when they were done with them just throw them  To the animals  Yeah  Oh that's not appropriate  That's really not appropriate  But it's funny because we don't know them  I'm just very surprised  That's why it's funny  That's why it's funny  I just don't  Knowing you 
[02:23:30]  I'm very surprised you put yourself in so much danger  Nah well you have to  I mean it's like  It was like for soldiers man  It was weird  It was like  How can you not go to Iraq  And support that  You have to  And this was right after Saddam got caught  So the insurgencies were starting  But it weren't as bad  Yeah  My friend Tony  You should have him on one time  He's a comedian  He got to actually go into the jails  He got  I mean he went like on the  Pile them up with dog leashes  Or  He said they would bring the prisoners out  And the other comedians were screaming at the prisoners  Oh comics are screaming at you  And he said they got stuck in Baghdad traffic 
[02:24:00]  In a tank  I mean they were like  We got like flown around  We were there for a week  He was there for like a month  Wow  So he took the army tour  Wow  A real rough one  Hey Rick in Kansas  What's up?  Hey Jimmy  Did they do any combat landings when you was in the hurricane there?  Combat maneuvers  Yeah they did them on every  We didn't get to go on any Blackhawks  I know they do them on them too  But on the C-130 they did combat maneuver landings  I think on two out of the three flights  Or three out of the four  Yeah those are 
[02:24:30]  Yeah I used to be a load master on the C-130  Station in Japan here  About four or five years ago  And  We practiced those combat stops and takeoffs  You know those things will throw you through the  Through that forward bulkhead pretty quick  Oh yeah the combat takeoff  I forgot where they take off really low  And they kind of go straight and pick up speed  All of a sudden straight up  It's awful  They're awful experiences  Oh yeah 
[02:25:00]  Do they at least warn you?  No  So they have no idea what's going on  Of course not  Yeah they do when your asshole is by your ears  Then you know  Oh yeah there's something going on here  Alright Rick  Go ahead  Set the brakes and ramp up the engines  Then just let her go  Yeah this guy  That didn't affect them at all  They just meant nothing to them  Probably do it a hundredth of times  Weren't affected  Doesn't matter  Alright  Hey we got audio from Fallujah  Yeah let's hear some of this  You were talking about this when we first got in  Oh I love seeing my tax dollars at work  You can't really see this stuff 
[02:25:30]  And years ago you never really saw it  Now there's plenty of video coming out of Fallujah  Took a little while longer than I would have liked  But now they're really pounding them  I mean pounding them  They're using shoulder fired stuff  That looks like they pulled it off a tank  It's not these little RPGs like the insurgents have  They got these computer guided rocket launchers  That they're shooting into these buildings  It's just leveling them  And then they pull up these APCs  These armored personnel carriers 
[02:26:00]  And tanks next to these buildings  And they're just driving down the street like you would drive  And then they turn the gun  Point it in a window  And you see these rounds going in the window  And the entire interior of the building  Is glowing in the other windows  And then they'll turn it around  Get across the street  Move on  Like they're delivering the mail in Fallujah  Here you go rag head  Ag ag ag ag ag ag  And then Dan I got a little something for you  Ag ag ag ag ag ag 
[02:26:30]  And then they move on  And they leave these buildings glowing  Glowing  I love it  Big flaming tracer rounds  Right through the window  Anyone home?  Hello?  America calling  Going back like just a couple feet here  Toolbag writes  On the news when they first raided Saddam's palaces  They said he had a copy of Pulp Fiction in his movie room  Hey  He's got some good taste in movies  I have Iraqi money  That was kind of cool  You do?  Some genuine Saddam money 
[02:27:00]  With his picture on it?  Yeah  I have a lot of the fake stuff over there too  Like it's been made since  But I have a lot of the real stuff  They've got knockoff crap over there  Just  Yeah  We went to Abraham's birthplace  And uh  You know  Did you set up a table  With some of your CDs  And DVDs  And shirts?  My crinkle crinkle shirt  Yellow discipline  Oh  Jimmy Norton  Yes  Sleeping puddle of AIDS  But they don't get what AIDS is  So they just go  Why would you want to slip in a puddle of helpers?  Jesus 
[02:27:30]  All right  So let's check out the Fallujah audio  See if there's anything here  Yeah let's listen in  It might be a better visual  But I think some of the Marines get very animated  Oh they do  It's good to watch this  And I don't know how well it translates on audio  But uh  When you watch it you see how real soldiers are  And we always get so upset here in this country  About language  This is the real deal  I mean they're in combat  And they're saying fucking shit  And they're cheering when a building blows up  You know?  It's not like in a bad movie  Where they're not using authentic language 
[02:28:00]  And that's kind of what  Even though Jimmy didn't think it's a good movie  The Saving Private Ryan  Where they put it on television  For uh  What was it? Veterans Day?  Veterans Day  They put it on TV  And I'm reading they got hundreds of FCC complaints  For the language  Now what kind of  You're watching a movie about war  And there's realistic language  It's not offensive  Because this is the language  People use in that situation  And uh  Hundreds  And last time they played it on TV 
[02:28:30]  One complaint came in  But now it's all the rage to complain  When you hear a fuck on TV  Because it's a hypersensitive issue now  The whole indecency in the FCC  Yeah so the uh  The FCC has hundreds  And we'll see where that goes  But uh  The Fallujah audio  You might be able in the background  To hear some of these soldiers  This is real language  This is the way real people talk  In these situations  And the  The  The  The  Richard 
[02:29:00]  The  The  The  The  The  Oh, God damn.  Yeah!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! 
[02:29:30]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Get ready, go!  Holy crap!  And they're cheering.  I got goosebumps.  Dude, that's the shit.  You hear them screaming in the background, yeah!  Go, go, go!  That's the shit.  That's the real deal.  You hear that language?  Oh my God, that's offensive. 
[02:30:00]  They're the guys over there fighting.  Another reason why it's great to be on satellite radio.  You couldn't play this on the radio.  No, no.  This is real life crap.  You hear that friggin' fire being laid down?  Oh, you just gotta...  You know, any human being, you cannot imagine being in that situation.  You could not imagine being in that situation where that shit's flying over you like that,  and you're dealing it out.  It's...  You cannot give these guys enough credit for actually doing this. 
[02:30:30]  It's amazing.  Oh!  Oh, get up!  Well, that was a quickie, but...  Yeah, I think that was one of the guys that kinda got injured.  Had something...  Hit his...  Hit his face under his eye.  He looked like he was fine.  Oh my God, they're not messing around. 
[02:31:00]  You do not want to be on the receiving end of that one.  Oh my God.  They are laying so much shit into these windows.  You see how fast the US military took Fallujah after this stupid election? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  What, four days?  Done.  To take this shithole over?  Yeah.  And they were running that place for months.  Months!  For months, they would do whatever they wanted.  All those people that got killed got their heads lopped off on video.  It was all done in Fallujah.  They found these houses.  They just found a woman laying in the street dead.  Ugh.  Another hostage.  The bridge in Fallujah is where they hung the bodies of the American businessmen  that they murdered months and months ago.  That was just taken. 
[02:32:00]  I mean, these guys, they ran this place.  And to let politics cut short by a minute getting these motherfuckers and killing them  in that city is a disgrace.  Yep.  Just so, if anything went wrong, or because the Democrats would have been able to twist  around whatever was happening, or because the Republicans are afraid that it's going  to cost them the election if something happens that they can twist into...  Just any politics playing its way in and costing any more lives is a disgrace. 
[02:32:30]  Both sides are guilty of that one.  There's still barriers there.  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  Yeah, that one where they were cheering, they pretty much took the corner of a building  out.  There was some people shooting at them from a barrier on what looked like a porch on the 
[02:33:00]  corner of a building.  And they had sandbags and stuff, fortified, like they love thinking they're safe.  I wonder, how do these guys come home and just live a normal life after this?  That's one of the biggest problems.  I mean, you're like, you got carte blanche to do whatever you want over there basically,  and then you go back to your neighborhood with your old pals and stuff, and it's got  to be weird.  I'm thinking, how do you find excitement in your normal everyday life, even though this  is horrible.  I mean, these guys got to be terrified.  Yeah, but tell like it is, there's an excitement level. 
[02:33:30]  Of course there is.  An excitement level that now you're what?  You're going to go home and, you know, listen to the wife's day at the office or driving  the kids to the soccer game after you are blowing a building apart?  Hey Charlie, want to go to the movies?  I hear there's a good movie coming out.  It's an action picture.  Yeah, let's go see The Incredibles.  I hear it's a fine flick.  Action picture?  You were driving a tank down the street, blasting through boards.  That's action.  You were living a real-life video game, and now you're at home. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, I can't wait until the Fallujah video game comes out.  You know it's coming out.  Sounds like New Year's Eve at Ted Nugent's house.  Well, there you go.  It's translated a little bit to radio, but it kind of gives you the picture.  The video's now up all over the internet.  Yeah, yeah.  Go to Drudge.  Drudge has a report, and it's got the video of it.  All right. 
[02:34:30]  Hats off.  Hats off to them over there.  The beauty of this radio show got a little serious there, and next we talk about Rent  Boys, a book that Jim Norton decided to bring in and share with us for some reason.  Wow.  Rent Boys.  Look at the picture on the cover.  You pretty much know what you're getting in that book.  You don't know.  You don't know.  Also, a lady dies on the phone and she's babbling.  Hi.

[02:40:00]  What?  What's wrong, Anthony?  What, Opie?  We're back with you.  I can't hear you.  What's wrong?  Oh, my God.  Old habits die hard, I guess.  You have a habit that I know where it comes from.  I understand it completely, but you've got to break it.  Back in your solo days, the Opie Nighttime Attitude Show, which you did from 7 to midnight.  What?  On Long Island.  We had a hell of an attitude, too, when we did that show.  You know what it was called?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie.  Just Opie. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, look at you.  Opie.  Taking credit for my solo career.  I'm acknowledging the solo career.  Let's calm down, all right?  Opie's Nighttime Attitude.  Now, when he was running the show, there were many times, he would leave the studio.  Maybe he'd grab a cup of coffee, take a leak, or whatever.  And you don't want something screwing up on the song or the song ending and you not knowing.  So what you would do is crank up the audio in the studio for whatever's playing and then  leave the studio to do whatever you've got to do. 
[02:41:00]  He still does this.  So when you left just before, you crank that mashup up so loud, you leave the studio.  Me and Jim are like, so, Jimmy, what'd you do after the show?  Oh, well, he kind of went, grabbed something to eat.  I could.  And he's got to go, Ben, could you turn that down?  I could tell you where that came from.  It's a quick story.  When I was working in Buffalo Radio at the home of Rock and Roll in Buffalo, I've said  it before.  I've worked for three homes of Rock and Roll in my fine radio career, the Rochester home 
[02:41:30]  of Rock and Roll, Buffalo's home of Rock and Roll, and Long Island's home of Rock and  Roll.  And New York's?  No, NAW was just...  It was the Rock of New York.  Well, when we got there.  Where Rock lives.  Oh, really?  It's not living on all the other rock stations across America.  What the fuck does that mean, where Rock lives?  Where Rock is on life support.  What about when we were...  That's what it was.  That's what it should have been.  Yeah, all the jocks were over 60 when we got to town. 
[02:42:00]  And then AF in Boston.  Yeah.  The only station that really rocks.  That really rocks.  Oh, really?  The other ones just rocked.  So when the other stations are playing Metallica, they're not really rocking?  No.  What the freak does that mean?  The only station that really rocks.  The Rock.  Anyway, the reason I cranked a monitor, I was just starting out in radio.  I was doing radio in Buffalo.  I was the overnight scumbag.  But during the weekends, I had a real time slot. 
[02:42:30]  Like I would do afternoon drive, let's say 2p to 6p, which was pretty cool.  Because then now people are listening to you.  Well, I almost got fired.  If Dillette has this song, I'll be amazed.  You ever hear the song by the Rolling Stones, Star F?  What?  Yeah, Star Star.  Star Star.  Okay, Star Star.  All right.  We did this promotion, and you guys, I guarantee, will laugh at me.  This isn't even a setup.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  They came up with...  When I was working in Buffalo Radio at this station, they came up with this bright idea.  The Rolling Stones were, I don't know, either coming to town...  All right, don't play it yet.  No, trust me, don't play it yet.  Look at his face.  Don't go...  Don't play...  Don't play...  Don't play the song.  He's like...  He dropped all the carts in there, too, Anthony.  He played the song.  He played the song.  We're going to make him read out of Rent Boy now for doing that. 
[02:43:30]  Absolutely.  That is Eric's punishment.  Maybe that's what we should do.  That is Eric's punishment.  Is that the way to do it?  Can I...  Can I...  Not yet.  I want to section off what he has to read.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Eric, we got a punishment for you for jumping the gun.  You overachiever.  Yeah.  Over-eager little beaver.  All right.  So, the radio station came up with this bright idea.  You know how they're always going with these theme weekends.  We talked about the Black Party weekend, the four-play weekend, Aerosmith A to Z. 
[02:44:00]  Got to make a theme so it's more fun for the listener.  The Firecracker 500.  Oh, 500.  Ooh, what will be number one this year?  Is it going to be Stairway to Heaven, or will it be Won't Get Fooled Again by The Who?  Ooh.  So, they come up with this idea, I think because the Stones had another album coming  out or something, basically called Pick Your Stones Weekend.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  They had all the laser...  You're listening to Pick Your Stones Weekend on the home of rock and roll. 
[02:44:30]  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  It's like...  Or Pick Your Stones Weekend.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  Oh, yeah, that's when production, you know, then you couldn't be cool doing production  and it had to be like you didn't really care.  The Dry Delivery.  Right.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  All this week.  K-Rock.  K-Rock.  K-Rock. 
[02:45:00]  God, radio stinks.  On the only station that really rocks.  W-A-A-F.  That was every piece of production for A-F.  But back then, it was still the laser.  Oh, yeah.  This is the biggest thing ever to hit radio.  Star Wars sound effects.  Pick Your Stones Weekend.  So, basically, the concept was you call in and you pick a stone song and me as the stupid  DJ, I push the button and you get to hear your stone song as you're driving around miserable  Buffalo.  How about that? 
[02:45:30]  Quite easy, right?  Mm-hmm.  Well, they have a huge convention center in Buffalo and the home of rock and roll was  there and they had the speakers on the van.  It was like a car show or something.  Thousands of people there, not exaggerating.  It was just the thing to do in Buffalo.  There's not many things to do.  So, everyone went to the convention center and, yeah, it actually was called the Fox,  I guess.  The Fox was cranking out the radio station and I was on the air.  So, this girl calls up and totally fucked me, man.  And I almost got fired. 
[02:46:00]  I had to beg for my job.  Literally, I think I even had, I hate to admit it, a little tear in my eye.  Like, look, I have no place else to go.  I have no place else to go.  I did have to beg for my job.  Aw.  So, this girl goes.  Little Opie Schroeder.  Oh, champ.  I go to the phones and, you know, hi, the Fox.  Fox, is this Pick Your Stones Weekend?  Yes, it is.  What do you want to hear?  Can I hear Star Star by the Stones?  Of course. 
[02:46:30]  What's your favorite radio station?  The Fox.  That's right.  And I start the song.  So, back in those days, right, I would turn down the monitor and go, so anyway, and I  would have phone sex and talk to hot chicks and bitches on the phone.  So, I have no idea what's playing at the convention center in front of a couple thousand people,  right?  Uh-huh.  And all of a sudden, the hotline is, eh, eh, eh, eh.  And I'm, like, really flirting with this Buffalo Betty, big time.  And I have no idea what's going on with this song.  We've got to crank it up right about here, I think. 
[02:47:00]  Just picture this.  Picture this commercial radio being played to thousands of people, right?  I think it takes another, like, 30 seconds, right?  At first.  Basically.  Would have been an FCC violation?  Oh, my God, yeah.  It's coming up any second.  It's still a cool song, though.  All right?  Listen.  It's okay.  This is the problem with doing radio on the fly.  We can prepare this bit, but. 
[02:47:30]  But just remember, no monitor.  I have no idea.  I'm just watching the song Countdown.  Oh, boy.  Dude, this is the rest of the song.  Oh, my goodness.  This is pretty much the rest of the song.  They say someone could.  Maybe we get an intern to find out how many times they say, fuck, the whole thing played.  And now I'm like.  Wow.  So, what do you look like, really?  Well, I get off at, you know, 6 p.m. 
[02:48:00]  You want to, like, meet on the corner?  I'll do the drive-by to see if you're not a fat pig.  And, uh, oh, yeah, I would make believe it.  I would tell them I'm driving a pickup truck and I had a Honda.  No, I'll drive by in my pickup truck and, you know, if they were hot, you stop.  If not, you're in a different car.  You just keep going.  Yeah.  So, uh, what a creep.  So, this is playing at the convention center.  It just says fuck throughout the whole song.  I'm just the, I'm the plebe of the station.  There's no, here, turn that off.  Turn it up again.  That girl totally fucked you over. 
[02:48:30]  So, the hotline is ringing, and it's counting down.  The song's over.  And then, uh, Mike Benson, really good guy, he's still up in the area doing radio.  He's like, dude, did you, do you know what you just played?  Oh, no.  And then he told me, and I swear to God, I went white.  I went white and I saw my career, which was just beginning.  Just budding.  Just budding, like little, little, little 13-year-old African.  Fucking girls' boobies.  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  And, uh.  And her kids.  And I'm like, and then the next call, the hotline's ringing.  It was him first.  And I swear to God, I went white.  I'm like, there's no reason why they would keep me.  I have no, I have nothing.  I'm just starting out.  And then, sure enough, the next call was the hotline.  Uh, I want to see you in my office Monday morning at 9 a.m.  Don't you do it!  This is really me.  Begging.  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go! 
[02:49:30]  I got nothing else.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole?  Yes.  But you know what?  I think the only reason they kept me, I was working like 70 hours a week and making like  12 grand.  So.  It's cost effective.  I think that's the only reason they didn't fire me, because they were getting a lot out  of me, you know?  But can you imagine this playing to a convention?  How many times did they say it?  That's what I'm saying.  We'll have it in about 10 seconds.  Hang on. 
[02:50:00]  It's unbelievable.  It's the whole song.  It's the whole song, Anthony.  Probably the most fucks in any song.  It's not like the who, you know, who the fuck are you?  It goes by real fast and that's it.  Yeah, well, who the fuck are you?  Just imagine this playing at a convention center for thousands of people.  And Mike Benson, he's like, I couldn't get the speaker.  Not only did he, well, I guess they couldn't turn the volume off in the van because it  was a lot, whatever.  So he's grabbing this huge speakers off the van and jumping on top of the woofer to try  to muffle the sound while they try to find where the volume was. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, because people probably knew what it was before the song even started, when she  requested it.  Right.  And you went, yeah, people probably already started panicking, like, uh-oh, I know what  that song is.  I was playing DJ.  Like, I made believe I knew the song.  That's why they wanted to fire us.  They're like, you sound like, I'm like.  I'd never heard the song in my life.  I just thought it was a Stone, you know.  We're playing any Stone song?  And I just turned down the monitor.  Just turned it down.  And I'm back on the phone flirting with this girl.  And this is what's going on all over the years.  She tried to screw you.  She knew what the song was. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  How many fucks are in that song?  This lyric page here is saying 35 times.  No, it's way more.  It's got to be more than that.  It's got to be more than that.  They probably just do it once for the chorus and they count it as one.  Yeah, listen.  Get an intern in the other room to just.  It's quick.  I guarantee it's more than 35.  It's got to be.  I don't know.  That's a lot.  35 is a lot.  Dude, that's the whole song.  It's just over and over.  Fuck the star.  Fuck the star.  Come on.  But why did they fire?  Did they realize that Sponge Buckley was irreplaceable?  When you're making $12,000 a year, yes. 
[02:51:30]  Irreplaceable.  $12,000 large.  Nice.  I was doing Midnight to Six, and then I would sit in on the Bear Man show all the way to  10 a.m., Anthony.  The what?  The Bear Man.  He's a good guy.  The Bear Man?  He was the guy I told you.  I used to tape my sexcapades.  Yeah, but The Bear Man?  And then play it back for him, yeah.  What was the name?  His name was The Bear Man.  Ugh.  Why?  He's like the king of Allentown Radio to this day.  Bear like, arrr.  Or bear like you're ready to jump in a crock pit. 
[02:52:00]  Huge guy.  In New York.  Huge.  Six.  Yeah?  Six, maybe 300.  Oh, okay.  That's what I was.  Huge guy.  I was asking why The Bear Man?  The Bear Man, and he's big like a bear.  And I don't know what he's doing now, but back then he did some great radio.  He's the king of what?  Well, he's from like Allentown area, so.  The king of Allentown Radio?  Yeah.  They brought him into Buffalo, and then he moved back home.  He does fine for himself.  I'm not saying he doesn't, but just that title is awful.  Well, that's the title I just gave him.  I don't know what they call him.  He's the king of Lancaster comedy.  So where were we?  We went off on a major tangent. 
[02:52:30]  We were going to talk about something.  We absolutely did.  Eric was going to do a little reading.  Oh, now Eric's got to do his reading?  I think so.  All right.  I don't know.  Look at 37.  See where I sectioned it.  Let me see while we go to Lady Di.  Can you give this to Hot Cock?  The cover of that.  It's a good cover.  I didn't know what it was.  Lady Di.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  How's it going?  Not just a name, but a good idea, as Anthony used to say.  Yeah, thanks a lot, Opie.  Hey, well.  So, um. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah?  So, uh, a party last night?  No.  No partying last night.  Any men at your place?  Why weren't you at the gig?  Um, I had, no, no, no.  I wasn't feeling good.  I wasn't feeling well, so I couldn't go.  So I told Mary to let her husband go.  All right.  You weren't feeling good.  Are you feeling good today?  Yeah.  Hangover.  Hangover.  Oh, I have a little bit of a cold.  Hangover from Friday night?  No.  So, how's the job search?  Um, the job search is going pretty good.  I mean, I'm putting in applications and stuff like that. 
[02:53:30]  I'm just waiting for people to call me back.  Where are you looking?  All over the place.  All over here.  All over where I live.  Name a place you've given an application to.  A place that I gave an application to?  There's the question after the question.  So she can think about it.  Which is thinking time.  I went over to a drugstore, and I put an application in there.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  And, uh, you know, prior to that, um, let me see.  Where else did I go?  So, I went to several places.  Some of them are, you know, further than here, and others are close and everything like that.  And I just went to several places. 
[02:54:00]  You know, like a, um, you know, restaurant and stuff like that.  I'm still waiting for them to call.  The crossing guard.  They told me to call back next Monday.  We should have that by now.  Huh?  Nothing.  Go ahead.  We're not listening.  No, no, no, no.  The person's out there.  See, this is what happens when someone, this is what happens when someone is just babbling  and, you know, you start other conversations amongst yourselves.  We're just talking to each other here.  Don't bend that cover.  Don't bend that cover.  This isn't different than, uh, real life.  You have nothing, so we start a little side conversation. 
[02:54:30]  We ask our listeners to do the same.  Right.  When Lady Di's talking, just, uh, start chatting with whoever's next.  On the new show, we don't waste time hoping for good radio.  No.  So, Lady Di, I'm, we're gonna, what, do you have something, or?  Lady Di, this is Norton.  Yes.  Hi, Jim.  I'm not even teasing you.  You gotta stop drinking.  Okay.  I, I understand.  Well, that was easy.  Okay.  Jim, you ought to, you ought to go into business.  I understand, I understand you completely.  That's not an okay.  You gotta stop.  I quit, you can quit.  You know, we don't, we don't show our true sides, uh, often on this program. 
[02:55:00]  Mm-hmm.  And you do good radio with Marion, because you are a mess just in general.  What?  No, we're not.  And you're really stupid.  Like, you don't know anything about anything.  I do, too.  But, but, the one thing we will get serious about, you really gotta stop drinking, because  we're, we're gonna get the call that you're dead, and we're gonna feel bad.  No, no, no, that ain't gonna happen.  Your face is bloated.  That's not gonna happen.  Your face is bloated, like your liver isn't working 100%.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I gained weight.  That's why.  Yeah, but in your hair. 
[02:55:30]  You gained it everywhere.  Yeah, that's alcohol leaking out of your hair follicles.  Oh, God.  Do you know, if you were on fire, instead of putting you out, someone would yell,  The Humanity!  Ah, you know that's not true.  Of course it's not true, because you're not as big as a blimp, you idiot.  Right, but way to be literal.  Jesus.  Oh, that's not true.  Rule number one in humor, be completely literal.  They would never yell, The Humanity, The Humanity, as people jumped from my body.  I've always been a big girl.  You know, I was on a diet one time, and I lost a lot of weight, but then I just put it 
[02:56:00]  right back on again.  And I mean no disrespect by this, but how can somebody, like, as large and rotund as  you have no ass?  I've never seen a fat girl with no ass before.  No ass or boobs.  Now, wait a minute.  She's a flatso, they call her.  That's something I cannot help, okay?  And something you've got to work on, exercise, okay?  You're telling us to work on exercise?  Yeah, you exercise for that, if you want, you know, if you want a nice butt.  Your ass cheeks look like cancerous kidney beans.  Really? 
[02:56:30]  She thinks a lot.  She's definitely got an Oliver Hardy body, too.  Yeah, I do.  When she used to walk in the studio, and that music would play, nothing, I laughed every  time that awful music would play.  Because she'd have the same smile on, she'd fiddle with her tie.  The only thing I have to do is get a haircut again.  That's all I've got to do.  My hair is long.  Yeah, but it looks like, you look like a younger version of Throw Mama from the Train, the mother  in that movie.  You really do.  Thank you so much. 
[02:57:00]  You know who should cut your hair?  Al Zarcawi.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I've got to go there.  I've got to look like Throw Mama from the Train, younger version.  Good.  Way to get the news reference.  No, she's hotter.  Oh.  Keeps on trucking.  Hey.  That's not nice.  You should be decapitated.  I heard Danny DeVito almost didn't do that movie.  What?  All right, Lady Di.  Zarcawi, are you?  A long time ago.  That movie was on a long time ago.  That movie was on a long time ago? 
[02:57:30]  It was out a long time ago.  Out a long time ago?  Yeah.  They would cut their own heads off if they had to have her in the same room.  Just shut up, woman.  Shut up.  You.  All right.  Well, Lady Di.  Yes.  Honestly, as your demented pals, whatever, you've really got to, like, get help.  Yeah, really.  Get help.  It's very obvious at this point.  I got help.  Voss got help.  There's plenty of us who are wrecks.  I've been sober 18 years.  18 years.  Oh, that's a good one. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  Anyway, I have an appointment that I have to keep.  What appointment do you have?  All right.  I have to go to Plainfield for something.  For what?  Pick up some dope?  What kind of a...  No.  What do you have to get in Plainfield?  You got to drop off your latest bar fly?  No.  What do you have to do?  Is Mickey Rourke there?  No, no, no.  It's some kind of an evaluation that I have to do, so...  What kind of an evaluation?  Oh, boy.  Don't be cryptic.  I'm not going to get into that.  Why not?  We tell you everything.  What kind of evaluation?  Are they doing a body, like, fat mass test? 
[02:58:30]  Huh?  What?  Are you sick?  Nothing physical.  What?  No.  Mental evaluation?  A mental evaluation for a job?  Well, yeah, kind of.  You could say that.  Or a mental evaluation so you can get your kid back.  No.  No.  Well, yeah, yeah, no.  Yes and no.  Yes and no.  See, that's what I mean, man.  You got to take care of yourself.  Just answer questions...  I'm fine.  As smoothly as that.  My kid won't be back over here.  You're not fine.  You can't smile and go, I'm fine.  I'm fine. 
[02:59:00]  Things aren't fine.  Wait, I just heard you.  Except that.  You didn't lose your kid, right?  No, I did not.  But he's not living with you right now?  Well, actually, he's with my father, but I did not lose him.  All right.  Why is he with your dad?  Because he's with my dad.  I guess, you know, I don't know.  There's more financially stable right now over there.  Well, then why don't you stop drinking and you can work that out?  You got it.  I think I should.  Stop drinking and having these guys over your house.  Oh, well, you know.  The guys are my friends.  Oh, well, you know.  Yeah, great friends. 
[02:59:30]  They stay up drinking and smoking all night.  No, they don't.  You're in a depression.  You can pull yourself out of it.  I know it sucks, but just if you stop drinking, that's the first and most important thing.  Everything else will follow if you stop that.  You know what helps?  Cutting.  Right, Jim?  If you just take a razor blade and cut your body a little bit.  It does seem to help a little.  It alleviates a little tension.  The mental pain is translated into some form of physical pain.  Yeah.  And it's easier to deal with, so you might want to give that a try.  All right.  You know what?  They don't party all the time.  Maybe just on the weekends. 
[03:00:00]  Party all the time.  Party all the time.  Party all the time.  How are you?  Do they sing that about you?  My cow wants to party all the time.  I don't want anybody to get any.  Well, look, we hung in there long enough, and now here comes the bit, everybody.  Okay.  Anyway.  So, all right.  You got your evaluation.  My girl wants to eat all the time.  Eat all the time.  My girl wants to exercise none of the time.  Exercise none of the time.  Wait a minute.  Patty did get my resume, by the way. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, she did, because she told Marion that on Saturday.  All right.  So, she got the resume.  My girl should wash her hair with turpentine.  No, no, no.  My hair is clean.  My girl has a body like a swine.  Body like a swine.  Be nice, Norton.  Now, look.  It's never too late.  We'll see you guys before Thanksgiving, okay?  My drunk cannot walk a straight line.  Enough with that. 
[03:01:00]  My girl's stomach, I must climb.  Stomach, I must climb.  Enough with that.  Okay, let me get a call.  What?  What?  You're not leaving now.  The serious part of the phone call is over.  Now, it's time to get back to business.  I want to put an apple in my girl's mouth and tie her feet with twine.  Tie her feet with twine.  My girl can't find a big enough beer, Stine.  Big enough beer, Stine. 
[03:01:30]  Very funny.  Oh, yes, it is.  When you sit where we're sitting.  Oh, boy.  Quick rhyming words.  I know.  That's what we're all doing.  We're all just trying to keep her on the phone while we rhyme.  Don't worry about it.  Mine, fine, Stine.  Mine.  We will be okay.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  Take care of yourself.  Okay.  All right.  We'll see you again before Thanksgiving.  Lady Di? 
[03:02:00]  Yes.  Bye.  Okay.  That was pretty funny.  Yeah.  She is a wreck.  Yeah.  Just taking a breather.  I mean, look, I love being a part of the show,  but when Opie's music cue doesn't get done the way it's supposed to.  No, they didn't know we're going anywhere.  They have to.  No, no, no.  I'm not talking about that one.  He has to read.  But heads must roll.  Heads must roll and things must be read. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  You know what?  All right.  We'll do that next.  All right.  I'm just thinking about you.  All right.  Go.  Cash up, nigga.  All my niggas in the P now, right now.  Bubby, Hagi, Bubby, shoot.  We're doing it out here, nigga.  We're about to take all the millions.  You hear me?  All I got to say to XM Satellite is fuck my dick  because they ain't give me no money.  The OB and Anthony Hill.  XM Radio, cash up, all day, everything.  Get that bitch, nigga.  Stop pushing me.  Fuck you, bitch. 
[03:03:00]  Red 36.  ACC football.  ACC football.  The ACC Today.  Maryland.  Virginia.  UNC.  Duke.  NC State.  Wake Forest.  Georgia Tech.  Clemson.  FSU.  And new to the ACC.  Virginia Tech.  And Miami.  It's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.  It's Monday, the 15th of November, 2004.  I'm Ari Bikowski with the ACC Today.  A 54-yard attempt.  Right angle to the left.  Here's the snap. 
[03:03:30]  Here's the spot.  The kick.  It's up.  It's got the distance.  It is.  Ah!  He told me he was going to win a game for us this year.  Matt Brooks has done it.  A 54-yard career-long field goal.  Duke wins it.  16-13.  The crowd is on the field.  The Duke Radio Network on the call.  Now, did you catch your breath?  You heard it.  Makes no sense, huh?  Clemson last Saturday beats Miami, then turn around and loses to Duke this weekend. 
[03:04:00]  Go figure.  Here's ball.  Almost fell down.  Coming from center.  He'll throw back.  End zone.  Caught.  Touchdown.  Jimmy Dixon.  Second consecutive week.  Dixon has caught a touchdown pass.  ISP Sports Network on the call.  An interesting game on the schedule for Georgia Tech.  They're taking on the UConn Huskies.  And Tech gets a fairly easy victory, winning 30-10.  ACC!  Ben Maugh, the quarterback, from the shotgun.  There's a snap to the ball.  Here's Maugh looking to throw.  Going to fire one over the middle.  It's going to be intercepted by North Carolina. 
[03:04:30]  Back at the 10-yard line.  And since the ball comes up with his first pick of the year, and the Tar Heels are one  snap from ending the ball game.  The Tar Heels Sports Network, a division of Learfield Sports, on the call.  UNC liked a close one there.  Back and forth contest against Wake Forest and Winston-Salem.  Big plays and big games.  Tar Heels 31.  The Demon Deacons 24.  And that's the ACC Today on XM Satellite Radio.

[03:05:30]  Look at this crowd roar!  The game that was born on the radio now joins the next generation of radio.  XM Satellite Radio is now the official satellite service of Major League Baseball.

Just when you had time to take a breather, XM Satellite Radio brings you right off the bench. 
[03:06:00]  One minute of the passing lane will go, but the next minute, he's there.  Get that weak stuff out of here.  You hear that sound?  He shoots.  This is the hook stuff.  It's time to take off the warm-ups.  College basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  We have ACC, Big Ten, and Pac-10.  Round ball, baby.  It'll be a full slate on channels 180 through 188.  Huge rivalries.  ACC, North Carolina and Duke.  Yeah, hills. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, hills.  Yeah, hills.  Blue double.  Arizona, UCLA.  Go Cats.  Go Cats.  Yeah, Bruins.  Yeah, Bruins.  Indiana and Purdue.  Who's that?  Who's that?  Boilermakers, Boilermakers, Boilermakers.  Oh, yeah, and we have much more.  All season long, we're taking it hard to the hoop.  The defensive pressure continues.  That was a...  With college basketball on XM Satellite Radio.  It's the ACC, Big Ten, and the Pac-10.  College basketball on channels 180 through 188 on XM Satellite Radio.  No one will outscore us. 
[03:07:00]  Aw, it's so cute.  Whoopsie-daisy.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Asses like 10-year-old boys.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Give me build, give me five, give me double-tonARA design.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, man, crank that up.  I'm just saying we're back.  That rocks.  Although, Hardcore Metallica fans, this is shit.  I love this one, though. 
[03:07:30]  I know.  Fuel.  The memory remains.  This is great.  Good stuff.  Well, wait a minute.  Yeah?  Did somebody turn down the music before Opie wanted it turned down?  Boy, you want penalties doled out for everything, don't you?  Yeah, Norton is working on his first bit for the Opie and Anthony show.  It's about time you've been with us for four years, five years at this point.  What's my first bit, I don't think.  Well, it's the first bit that you've actually brought to the table with confidence saying, 
[03:08:00]  look, I think I got something for the show.  No, I actually said, read this, it's hot.  Right, that's all.  Pretty much all he said.  No, you kill on the show every day, but it's very rare that Jim will actually suggest something we can do.  And he might have a good idea.  He brought in this book, Rent Boys.  Rent Boys?  And now he wants people, when they F up on this show, to read passages from this book.  I'll tell you how I got my hands on it.  Yeah, please.  It's true.  It's on the cover.  Why does Steve here all act as the color?  Steve wants to mess up in the baddest way right now. 
[03:08:30]  No, no, no.  Steve's coming in to confess things he did, and then one time I did this.  Ben was talking to me outside, he said, watch this, Eric just walked into a bloodbath.  What?  Oh, okay.  I didn't hear you, Steve, his music playing.  He doesn't put his headphones on, he can't tell.  He plows right through it.  That's so funny, man.  Like he plows through a martini.  I was just talking to Ben outside.  He said, okay, all right. 
[03:09:00]  Get in here.  You did a great job with the O&A passion thing.  The cover is a...  Oh, yeah.  What's on the color, ass?  I'm not here.  Where'd you get this book?  Give me the cover.  Okay.  Give me the book.  The cover says, Rent Boys, Hustlers and Escorts is the little subtitle.  Gay Erotic Tales, edited by David, whatever his name is.  But the cover is, it's a young man, nude, but barely covering his crotch with his hand 
[03:09:30]  and touching it, tweaking, if I may say, his nipple between his middle finger and pointer  finger as he gently has his hand over his breast.  And he's got this look on his face like, I've taken 20 miles of cock in my ass.  My friend, I saw my friend...  This is going to be a little rough.  Go ahead.  My friend, this is how I got my hands on the boat.  My friend Megan gets in my car on like Friday night and she goes, you have to read this book. 
[03:10:00]  My brother got, I don't know how her brother got his hands on it, if it was a goof gift  or her brother's...  I really don't know.  But she's like, she's a really, actually a really twisted chick and she has a weird  sense of humor.  She's like, turn to page 37.  So I turn to page 37 and we're reading it together and it was gay, erotic, hardcore sex and  it was hilarious.  And I immediately thought how nice it would be to hear another male reading this.  Having to read this.  Being forced to read this.  Being forced to read it seriously. 
[03:10:30]  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  You can't goof on it or put on a gay voice.  Nope.  And I just marked off a little section I felt for Eric, who's a great member of the show,  but I felt that for that, instead of demerits, we hand out paragraphs and I feel that page  37...  Look how anxious Jim is to hear some of this read.  I want to hear a young man speak these words.  Let me throw this on the table.  He barely effed up.  Oh, you think so?  Yeah.  Well, maybe you don't care about music cues, but I do.  And since I'm making decisions on who reads these things, keep your mouth shut or I may 
[03:11:00]  feel fit to find a little paragraph for you.  He was a little crazy about his music cue at the show, so maybe music cues...  Absolutely.  All right.  I don't think I forgot about you in there.  You're going to get him too?  All right.  Maybe not right now.  Old washboard abs.  You don't even know that guy's name.  Yeah.  I don't need his name.  I just see his jawline and his bulge, and that's all I need to know.  All right.  It's not much for you to read.  It's just from here.  No.  Come on.  It's here.  Just to right there.  It's only that one thing.  But I think you should read that.  It's a tale of hustlers.  Wait. 
[03:11:30]  That's a couple paragraphs you want him to read?  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's three paragraphs.  All right.  No gay voice.  Just read this.  No wacky radio voice.  Yeah.  Enjoy it.  This is his punishment.  Reading aloud.  This is why satellite radio rocks.  Okay.  Go ahead.  I flipped on the news when I got home, but I couldn't concentrate.  I kept thinking of Jason, his washboard belly, his tightly clipped dick, his beautiful  chest, his succulent rosy nipples, his pale smooth ass. 
[03:12:00]  Next thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees, and my shirt pulled up to my armpits.  I traced the fine line of the hair that bisected my belly, following it up through the deep  ridge dividing my pecs.  No laughing.  Don't laugh or I tack on paragraphs.  Right.  Don't kill my vibe.  My long fingers caressed the swell of my pecs, teasing the thick tits and the silky fur 
[03:12:30]  that coated the broad expanse of muscled flesh.  I threw my head back and squeezed my dick hard, forcing the first drops of clear, sticky  juice to drizzle out of my piss slit.  I could feel it trailing down the vein shaft, warm and sticky, and smelling like sex.  I tensed my body, looked down along its sculpted planes and angles with satisfaction.  My nuts dropped down between my outspread legs, nestling warm and heavy against my sweaty 
[03:13:00]  asshole.  I took a long pull on my dick, envisioning Jason's ruddy lips nuzzling against the glistening  sticky crown.  As I continued to jack off, I fantasized about burying my face in his crack, tonguing the  funky treasure hidden between those perfect ass cheeks.  Funky treasure.  I figured he'd be hot and tight and smooth.  New message board name. 
[03:13:30]  Funky treasure.  Sorry, go.  I figured he'd be hot and tight and smooth.  He'd tasted, he'd taste clean and he'd grown and rife as my tongue breached his chute.  Just thinking about it made my toes curl.  My hand flew up and down the shaft, pumping faster and harder as my nuts drew up into a  tight knot between my hairy thighs.  I envisioned Jason squatting over me, grunting at the fat, grunting as the fat head of my dick,  cowl peeled back, punched deep into him. 
[03:14:00]  His asshole was tighter than my fist, making man love to my aching meat.  Sweat trickled down my sides.  I nuzzled my pit, lapping up the pungent salty water, imagining my tongue was Jason's.  The end.  Jesus, are you happy, Hitler?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Now that you got that off your mind, read the paragraph.  Jesus, Norton. 
[03:14:30]  Funky treasure, you're right.  That's a new message.  That's a new message.  That's a new message.  I've never seen you happier.  We got an instant feedback from funky treasure.  What was the other line that was funky treasure and there was one more line that was fantastic.  The piss slit thing, I guess.  By the way, we have a month's worth of new promo material.  Steve's holding up huge signs in the other room, promo material.  You'll be hearing that one for a while.  All right, well, Steve better watch it or he'll be in here reading.  Hold on, let's go to the line, too. 
[03:15:00]  We're going down to D.C.  Hey, Jason, what's up?  Hey, I just want to know if he'll go out with me because he sounds so hot.  Didn't he?  He kind of put a little emotion into that that I didn't think he was going to.  Steve, what's going on in New York?  I'm going to drive off the bridge right now if that keeps up.  That was hilarious.  That's hot, right?  Why are we getting punished because of his mistake?  That's true.  I will not punish him.  I will punish all of you.  His funky treasure will have the barracks. 
[03:15:30]  Why aren't you stomping Private Pyle's piss-lit?  Sir, because I'm too ruddy, sir.  Because you're too ruddy.  Wow.  Let me hear you lick your pit and cry.  Let's see.  Spicnic 24-7 from Philly.  Eric's mom.  How'd the show go today, hon? 
[03:16:00]  Eric, I don't want to talk about it.  I just want to take a shower.  That's funny.  Damn it.  There's one more line in here.  Oh.  One more line?  No, there's one more.  And then you've read the whole book?  No, no, no.  There's just the funky treasure.  Perry, what's up?  Another one.  Damn it.  Hey.  Hey, man.  This is not more gooder.  This is way more gayer.  That's his punishment.  Oh, punishment.  Why do we have to suffer because of him?  Oh, you know it's funny.  You just know it's funny.  It was funny at the end when you guys jumped in, but I wanted to drive into a bridge apartment. 
[03:16:30]  All right.  It was bad.  Thank you, bro.  Yeah, Star has 56 F-words in it.  Oh, an update.  Mm-hmm.  56.  So you want Derek, right?  No, not Frenchie.  Did you have a problem with...  I felt that Derek purposefully undermined you enjoying the Metallica song, and I didn't like it. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, my God, he turns it down for a second as we came on.  I didn't like it.  That's why I'm now calling him Hitler.  I'm not Hitler.  You're the gay Hitler.  I'm Eman Gutt.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  That's right.  You're lucky you didn't leave a ring in my tub.  Look for his new book, Men's Fur.  I don't have a paragraph for him to read, though.  Oh, my God.  He's off the hook.  No, no, you're not off the hook, boy.  I'm sure you can find one quickly. 
[03:17:30]  You guys talk.  I'll find something hot.  A quickie.  Yeah, we got a quickie right here.  Stalker Patty, what's up?  Hi, how you doing?  Hi, how are you?  Fine.  Listen, before I can help her, like, referring her to different things, she's got to get herself together first.  Oh, are you pulling out on her now until she gets her shit together?  Talking about Lady Di, of course.  She's going to embarrass the hell out of me.  You know, my good name goes along with a reference, and then she doesn't last a week.  Good name, slow down. 
[03:18:00]  She had a couple things, and she doesn't last more than a week.  You're not going to vouch for her?  Oh, I will, but I want to see her get help first and get the drinking out of the way entirely.  I have a resume, by the way.  She did mail it.  I got it Friday.  And I found no less than six places in town around her with UPS alone.  We need package handlers that, you know, according to her resume, I guess she's done before.  Are you ready over there?  This is called Phil. 
[03:18:30]  Wow, this is fantastic calling.  You're ready, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I found a pattern.  All right, thanks, Patty.  Not as much as Eric.  Oh, Patty.  There you go.  But I still felt that your purposeful undermining of one of the show's hosts was a detriment  that is not to be tolerated.  This will teach everybody.  Yeah, this will keep this ship running tightly, if I may.  You'll see where I've, from that part right there.  It's not as much.  Because you didn't mess up as much?  No, I just felt the listeners haven't been awful enough to deserve another full-length 
[03:19:00]  three paragraphs.  Read it and read it with confidence.  All right.  And enjoy it.  Are you just going to, you're going to keep this book with you, right?  No, the book is staying right here on the console.  I may have Eric Logan and Stradley come in here and do a little reading.  Oh, do a reading?  Yeah, even without the mics on, just to hear it.  It's hot.  Well, just put it in a bucket and they'll find it.  All right.  Right?  His hands found my dick and balls and began to stroke and pull for our audience.  My jeans and underwear slipped down to my knees. 
[03:19:30]  The itch up my ass threatened to go Nova.  I was dripping pre-cum like a faucet in need of a plumber.  You're a sick ass, Norton.  Norton found this one.  Chad pulled away and I bent over to get my clothes over my feet.  His hand had began to massage my gloves and I groaned.  His other hand found first one nipple and then the other. 
[03:20:00]  His hand on my butt found my crack and I almost immediately, one of his fingers was playing at my entrance.  I bent over some to give him better access and his finger plunged into me.  His other hand continued to pull and rub my nipples as we swayed to our own music. 
[03:20:30]  My ass against his crotch.  I forgot that we had an audience.  I just knew I had to have him.  All of him.  Inside me.  Now.  Cover that thing up and put it in.  I growled.  Oh, safe sex.  That was hot.  And that was actually two more paragraphs than I told him he had to read.  Good boy.  He went about a...  The proverbial bull by the horns.  Yeah, look at that. 
[03:21:00]  Everyone wants Steve to read a...  Well, believe me, he'll do something wrong.  First problem, all I don't like, believe me, he's getting called in here.  Wow.  People are going to start thinking this is Mark Perrino's show.  Hey, you want to read another paragraph?  Look, people are coming up with punishments.  They want to hear more already.  Greg, what's going on?  I read your book, you magnificent bastard.  Go ahead, Greg.  You guys rock.  Hey, Jimmy, I think I got a technicality for you for Steve. 
[03:21:30]  What's that?  You remember last week, Opie made the rule that when you come into the area,  you got to have your headphones on to hear?  Well, technically, you're right, but there's a grandfather clause.  Technically, since we only started this punishment today,  I can't start meting out the punishment for old infractions.  Yes, yes.  However, I do realize that Ben will do something wrong.  I certainly know Martini Steve will do something wrong.  I think Nathaniel is now attempting to do something wrong. 
[03:22:00]  So there's been plenty of infractions and problems.  All right, that's what I was going to say,  because Steve came in and without his headphones,  I'm talking about his little bit this morning.  And I hope that Master Poe doesn't forget to open that door when I'm coming through,  or there's going to be a problem.  Oh, man, if we could get Master Poe to read that someday,  that'll be the coup right there.  Okay, guys, you rock.  I'm out.  All right.  Get home safe.  You're insane.  God bless.  There'll be one more bloody gee to find a dumpster for.  George in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I don't know if I could do this, because Brian Regan's so cool, 
[03:22:30]  but I just wanted to tell you, I saw Regan this weekend,  and he totally killed.  Yeah, Regan, I got to tell you, he's probably my favorite, man.  I mean, he's just unbelievable.  Absolutely.  He's coming to New York early December, I think, right?  First weekend of December.  Carolines.  And you know what?  Call Carolines now and get your tickets,  because those shows sell out way in advance, so don't wait.  Oh, funny about Brian Regan,  I had a girl show up to my apartment the other day who was, 
[03:23:00]  let's just say, charging me to be there,  and she recognized me from when I opened for Regan with Voss.  Really?  So I had to not only pay her for sex,  I had to hear about how brilliant Regan was.  I can't tell you.  For a solid hour.  The blue one is my balls.  Yeah, no, he's one of those comedians,  he gets you going to the point,  you want to stop laughing because it hurts.  It hurts your ribs.  You wake up in the morning like, what happened?  Did I get punched?  Because your ribs hurt.  My wife has asthma.  I swear to God, she had an asthma attack while he was doing it. 
[03:23:30]  He's the real deal,  and I don't understand why Hollywood hasn't figured out something for him to do on TV.  I just don't get it.  I think they want to.  I mean, they love Regan.  It's just hard to find, I guess.  How about he reads from Rent Boys?  I'm sure Regan will do something bad when he comes here.  You know what?  If Regan, one foul up out of him, and there's definitely a paragraph.  And then my balls were hanging between my thighs.  Yeah, that's what happened. 
[03:24:00]  I was lonely.  Chad had some of that clear stuff coming out.  I called it dick full of clear stuff.  What was that nugget thing again?  It's a funky treasure.  A funky treasure, right, right.  Hey, I think I found a funky treasure.  I didn't even have a funky treasure, Matt, but I found it.  I'd love to have Voss do it, although he'd just butcher it and somehow not make it gay.  The funky treasure. 
[03:24:30]  Treasure-y.  And then I pulled an M out of my ass.  In honor of this awful segment, we're going to go to a tape here.  Oh.  A little phone call we made back in the old days.  And, yeah, we'll continue.  Is this okay with you?  Am I allowed to do this?  Fine with me.  Am I messing up?  No, no, you're doing fine.  Don't miss the post.  Look at him just looking around.  He can't wait.  He's already got a page picked out for you.  No, I know, but I'll find one.  All right. 
[03:25:00]  All right, Bob, are you ready to play?  Hi, Mom, I'm gay?  Absolutely.  Now, I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay?  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob, let's give it a shot.  All right.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me, darling?  Yeah.  It's Bobby.  Bobby?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah, well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, Mom, you sitting down? 
[03:25:30]  Why?  I got to tell you something.  What?  Don't get nervous.  Something I've been meaning to tell you.  I was going to call and tell you when you called earlier today.  Yeah?  I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s***.  I'm a Twinkie.  I swear it.  Bobby, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you never believe me?  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Bobby.  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah, okay. 
[03:26:00]  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Bobby.  What?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm not.  I got to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right.  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Bobby, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  Okay.  You can tell your father that.  I'm not even going to bring it up.  All right.  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people.  So what's the...  You know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it was to throw everyone off, you know?  Bobby, I don't believe it. 
[03:26:30]  However, you know...  You still love me.  I've had enough heartache.  I think, you know...  You still love me.  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh?  What the hell are you doing?  Drinking?  No.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No, I was going to spring it on him tonight.  Yeah, that's nice.  Yeah, you do that.  Stand a long distance away, will you?  I will.  Out of arm's reach.  Bobby, don't give me that bologna, please.  You break my heart when you do things like this. 
[03:27:00]  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  All right.  All right.  I love you.  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus.  Dude.  I got to get back to her quick, man.  She's going to put a knife in her wrist.  You better do that.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. life.  Yeah, this is a big fuck you to every single guy who drives a dumb truck, a fucking sanitation 
[03:27:30]  truck, and turns it over because the asshole doesn't know how to drive.  Slow down, you prick.  Fuck you.  Hello, this is Octana.  I'd like to leave a big F.U. to Steve C.  I appreciate a good bitch beating promo as much as the next nigga, but Steve, you just  take it too far.  Fuck you.  Hi, this is Reed from Cleveland, and I want to drop a big fuck you bomb on Yasser Arafat  and all those who think he's some sort of peacemaker.  You don't fool me, fucker. 
[03:28:00]  And I know you're ready for that fiery closet you're going to be in, jerking off on Christopher  Reeves' gink-ass while he's taking pictures of Mr. Rogers, 69 and Lacey Peterson, soaking  wet smurfette pussy.  Rock, you fucking terrorists.  Rock.  Go Browns.  Fuck all y'all.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Oh, fuck you very much.  So I'm watching Rocky IV the other day.  I'm saying to myself, two white guys fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world? 
[03:28:30]  Boy, that Spielberg's something else.  Basically, white guys cannot box.  Black guys fight better.  Puerto Ricans fight even better.  I guess the lower you go on the social ladder, the better you fight.  You think about for every good Puerto Rican fighter?  There's American Indians waiting to kick his ass. 
[03:29:00]  Nepal, I feel so sorry for the Indians, man, because we took, well, we didn't take you,  white people took their land.  And now they have nothing.  Everybody exploits the Indians, man.  You got fucking Mazzola commercials and F Troop and the Washington Redskins.  Redskins, that's not nice.  That's a racial slur, man.  That's kind of like having the New York niggas, okay? 
[03:29:30]  Denver Dykes, man.  Can't have that shit, man.  Remember the commercial?  The Indian had a tear in his eye for pollution?  Wasn't crying for pollution.  He took his land and fucked his wife.  I don't think he was crying because there was a tear, you know, or because there was a fucking  can on the ground.  I was like, yeah, you could fuck my wife, but that can gotta go.  Get it all in. 
[03:30:00]  I went to a Chinese restaurant in New York and the bitch I was with said there was hair  in her food.  You know, I said, where's her hair, baby?  She said, right here.  I said, well, fuck it, we ain't gonna pay for that shit.  Hey, man.  Come here, man.  There's some hair in the food.  I don't have no food.  I said, no, motherfucker, there's some hair in the food. 
[03:30:30]  I don't say I'll help.  I said, yeah, yeah, motherfucker, there's some hair.  What the fuck you talking about?  Take this shit out the way.  And the bitch talking about, oh, it's all right.  Shut up, bitch.  It was all right.  Why didn't you eat the shit?  I said, I ain't paying for shit.  Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.  And we was leaving.  The motherfucker grabbed me. 
[03:31:00]  But he didn't grab me like motherfuckers grab you  because we'd have been fighting all night.  They know that karate and shit.  That's how much was that?  Gave the motherfucker a tip and everything else.  Because I heard bones and shit snapping.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X. 
[03:31:30]  Obi and Anthony show.  XM 202.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[03:32:00]  Some of the O&A listeners outside the passion of O&A chanting monster rain.  Monster rain.  Someone threw a hat on stage in the middle of my act  that had monster rain written on it in pen.  Yeah, what the hell was that?  It's sweeping the nation.  It sure is.  Monster rain.  Boy, I'd love to be a porch maker these days.  Monster rain.  People wanted their porch a little higher than the old ones, I think, these days.  Just so you don't bump your head going under. 
[03:32:30]  You know what we got in the mail today?  The Silence of the Lambs, the musical, Anthony.  The actual CD.  Oh.  The clips we were playing last week were kind of poor quality.  I mean, this is CD quality, obviously.  Yes.  Much, much, much clearer to hear all the words.  Well, you know which one I want to hear.  You want to do our favorite?  Where's Steve?  I think we're going to get these guys on the show.  Hey, Steve. 
[03:33:00]  Smart move.  So far, so good.  Look at Jim just studying them.  He's just...  There you go.  Martini Steve, everyone.  Yes.  All right.  So are we going to get these guys on the show?  Working on it.  Working on it.  I called them yesterday.  They just haven't returned my call yet.  All right.  Well, they might have to be punished when they get in the studio.  If I'd like to know...  Wait a minute.  Did Anthony start playing the theme music?  No.  A little too soon?  I don't know.  I'm just making sure. 
[03:33:30]  He wields an iron fist, doesn't he?  He sure does.  He might start that a little too soon.  Oh, no.  You bet I wield an iron fist.  I'll punch your funky treasure with it.  He's the czar of gay.  You're the worst.  I'm not the worst.  I want this ship running smoothly.  Well, you guys want to hear...  I want to hear...  I really do.  I can't stop humming that song.  All right.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Well, we can play this, and then maybe at the end of this, 
[03:34:00]  we'll figure out what to do with the rest of the radio show today.  Attaboy, Elp.  Way to look at the future.  Okay.  Thank you, Jim.  So, Colin Powell stepped down.  Colin Powell has resigned as Secretary of State of these United States.  I think he was furious over the way he got hung out to dry in the U.N.  Hung out to dry?  How could you get hung out to dry when you pretty much agree and do things that you know are wrong?  Well, I mean, I think that he was kind of being the spokesman to talk about the uranium.  Like, that was an embarrassing...  When he got up there in front of the U.N., and I watched every word he said, 
[03:34:30]  and I was all riled up saying, well, obviously we got to go over there,  because they got all this proof that he's showing everybody the pictures of the mobile,  biological warfare-making trucks and the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction  that they had satellite photos of, the trucks that are moving these things.  And then what?  Now he's cranky about the way he was hung out to dry?  That's my speculation. 
[03:35:00]  He was part of the whole machine that got us over there.  You're right, but I don't think the intelligence failure was his.  I think that the administration probably wanted...  Because I think they're more partisan.  He knew it was bullshit.  He knew it.  He even said it later on.  It took one for the team.  Some of the stuff was he actually used the term bullshit.  Yep.  And he said one of the things that he was supposed to say he didn't.  And he said it in the meeting.  He said, I'm not going to say this bullshit.  Okay, but he was doing pretty much what he was told to do.  Yeah.  Okay, so that's what I mean by hung out to dry.  The guy's a soldier, first of all. 
[03:35:30]  That's what I'm saying.  He was told to do something.  I'm not saying he didn't know, but he was told to do it,  and he had to go out there and be in a weird way to fall, guy.  Like, I've got to read this garbage.  And he hung in there until the election was over.  That's obvious.  And that's what they do.  They hung in there because now Ashcroft...  He probably wants to step down immediately.  Ashcroft's gone from the Justice Department,  and now there goes Secretary of State Colin Powell,  and I think Rumsfeld.  I truly think Rumsfeld will be next.  Yeah, he might.  Whoever's been running the show over in Iraq has not done a great job.  No.  And, again, that may be because for political reasons, 
[03:36:00]  they're fighting their arms with both hands tied behind their dicks.  Who are they going to get to replace, Colin Powell?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  This is like something that...  Because before Rumsfeld resigned, before Ashcroft resigned,  they had had a little advance warning  and kind of had people lined up.  This is kind of a surprise.  I wasn't expecting this one.  I wasn't either.  All right.  McGreevey, maybe?  McGreevey.  Secretary of Funky Treasures. 
[03:36:30]  He'll show up in, like, a skirt.  Oh, it said secretary.  I wanted to take some dictation.  Give me those ribs, you.  Elbow, elbow.  All right.  So, Anthony, Silence of the Lambs, the musical.  I want to get a nice copy of this out there on the airwaves  for the fine folks that are downloading our show illegally for everybody.  This is Put the Fucking Lotion in the Basket.  I love this one.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin. 
[03:37:00]  Or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task.  It's Put the Fucking Lotion in the Basket.  Put the Fucking Lotion in the Basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So, I call them it instead of by their names. 
[03:37:30]  Mister, please, no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been.  I'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop drying out your big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining. 
[03:38:00]  So, I'm down before I jam a moth.  I'm down your fucking throat.  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go.  This isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose.  Don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway, but failed. 
[03:38:30]  Precious.  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you, but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fangirls in a fucking store. 
[03:39:00]  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend.  You don't know what pain is, but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  Nice.  That's one of our faves right now on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's great.  Yeah, we're trying to get the guys that did the music. 
[03:39:30]  We got them.  Wow.  Now we're talking to real celebrities, man.  That is hilarious.  Hey, who's this?  This is John and Al.  John and Al?  Yeah, we're both here.  Hi, guys.  You guys are calling from California?  Yep.  So it's like 6.40.  Sorry to wake you.  Whatever you guys are doing there, man.  But this Silence of the Lambs, the musical, is freaking hilarious.  You got to tell us a little bit about it.  All right.  We wrote it about it.  Yeah, I can recognize the voice.  Yeah, you did Buffalo Bill, didn't you?  You did Buffalo Bill.  Yeah, guess a little Buffalo Bill. 
[03:40:00]  Would you have me?  God, I feel like I'm talking to a big-time celebrity now.  That's right.  Dude, we're all humming your songs.  Isn't it a crook?  How about, was she a great big fat person?  Was she a great big fat person?  Very cool.  So why did you guys decide to make this?  Well, obviously, I mean, it's a hit, but.  We just did it for fun, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, we know that.  Like, basically, we saw that there was a song in Singing in the Rain called Would You, 
[03:40:30]  and that's one of our favorite Buffalo Bill lines.  Would you?  Like, for years, we'd have to say, would you?  Like, it was the idea.  So we had, like, an idea for, like, five or six songs within a minute,  and then we just did it in our apartment.  What kind of musical background you got?  We have composition degrees from USC.  Really?  Yeah.  That's nice.  Where'd you get the, you made all the music and everything?  Yeah, we did it all in our apartment.  All in your apartment?  Just you guys, or did you have, like, a?  Orchestras?  No.  It sounds really good. 
[03:41:00]  It's all us, and we had a woman sing on the chorus, but that's it.  It's great.  It's really great.  We can't get enough of this thing.  Are you selling this, or?  Until they shut you down?  We had it online, like, for, like, a year and a half for free,  and, like, lost a lot of money with people just downloading it,  but that's basically what we wanted.  Yeah.  And now we sell it just to try and make some of the money back.  Basically, we're breaking even, because we still have it online,  and it costs, like, 80 bucks a month.  Where can they get it online? 
[03:41:30]  Silencethemusical.com.  Was it one of your favorite movies?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What's your favorite song off this thing?  That's a good one.  The Lotion Song.  Yeah, obviously.  Yeah, that's the hit, man.  That one is just too goddamn funny.  That's your Welcome to the Jungle.  Fantastic.  We also like Are You About a Size 14?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good one, too.  Sure.  And, well, If I Could Smell Her Sea is pretty good.  We played that one, because we're on satellite radio.  Oh, wow.  Any other movies that you thought about doing this, too? 
[03:42:00]  Robocop.  That would be funny.  And Spartacus.  Spartacus.  We shall see.  Cool.  Very good.  Yeah, we just want to say hi to you guys,  because we've been having a lot of fun with this song the last week or so.  And, man, we're going to link you guys to our website, so.  Would you?  They fucked me hard.  Hey, what was that song,  I'm Crying Over You Crying?  You know the song in the background that he's tucking his dick between his legs and dancing to?  Oh, yeah, the real song in the movie. 
[03:42:30]  Crying Over You.  Yeah, it's really a hot number.  I don't know what the name of that song is.  A hot number?  Yeah.  Over You.  Dirty mechanic fingernails tweaking his own nipples.  Fuck me hard.  I love it.  Great job, guys.  Silencethemusical.com  What?  Yeah, these guys are half asleep.  I mean, let's be honest here.  Your website is silencethemusical.com.  People can purchase this. 
[03:43:00]  Maybe a few of our listeners should purchase it, please.  I know our fans are, you know, internet savvy,  but someone throw some money at these guys.  I'll just tape it off the fucking radio.  Fuck these guys.  I hope that they go for all.  Put the fucking money in the PayPal.  All right.  All right.  If you guys got anything else you want us to play on the radio, just contact Steve, okay?  Okay.  Thanks a lot.  You guys rock.  Thanks, guys.  See you later. 
[03:43:30]  There they go.  John and Al.  Very funny.  Very funny.  A couple of artistes.  A couple of artistes.  They're just hanging out there in California.  How long ago did they do that?  It's like what?  About a year and a half ago.  About a year and a half ago?  Are they still in school?  No.  They're both, they're working at some place that has to do with film composition.  What are they together so early in the morning for?  They're brothers.  Doing goofs on musicals.  Oh, they're brothers.  They're brothers.  Okay.  I was thinking maybe there was a lava thing going on there.  He's my lava.  Put your fucking dick in my asshole. 
[03:44:00]  Put your fucking cock in my funky treasure.  Oh, still there, huh?  What?  What happened?  Hello?  No.  No, they're gone.  They're gone.  Goofing on them.  I thought they were homos.  What, Steve?  No, brothers.  Very good.  Thanks, Steve.  You're welcome.  All right.  Thank you for that little bit of info, Steve.  All right.  Angel.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Not too much.  All right.  Why?  Just getting ready to go to work here after a while.  Hi.  All right.  And why are you calling the show today? 
[03:44:30]  Because my husband and I listen to you every day, and we think you're just hilarious.  Oh, thank you.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  And Norton, he's awesome, too.  Thank you, miss.  Yeah, he's awesome.  I give 110% every day, miss.  110%.  110%.  110%.  So what do you want to do?  Well, he asked if you want to put it in my pants.  All right.  But hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on one second, because I want to give this a try.  We're trying this for the first time on the show. 
[03:45:00]  We are.  Yeah.  Hold on one second, okay?  Trying what?  I'm just trying something.  Will I get in trouble if it doesn't work?  Well, this thing should be tried in pre-production.  It should not be tried on the air, but it works.  We're up this program to bring you the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Wow, Steve.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Not much.  What are y'all doing today?  Well, we're talking to you.  You're in Florida.  What do you have?  I got a midget sighting.  It was Saturday up in Queens. 
[03:45:30]  I was walking back from my girlfriend's house, and I stopped off at a gas station to get something  to drink.  I was like, I come back out, and this car door is like opening by itself, so I thought.  Just what I thought, he killed the bed.  He comes back strong.  Like a magic trick, those midgets.  All right, well, yeah, so it's opening by itself, then what happens?  And then he gets out, and I realize he's like three foot six. 
[03:46:00]  And with me being six foot four, I look down at this guy, and it's like, wow.  Top of his little flathead.  And that was it?  That was it.  All right.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Thank you, Frank Caliendo.  Angel.  Yes?  Hey, sorry about that.  No problem.  All right, so what do you want to do today?  Well, he asked if I wanted to play with some of my parents.  I called for a midget sighting, but he's already doing one now. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  He.  Meaning you, Opie.  Oh, me?  What?  Yeah.  You mean me?  So you want to play Guess What's in My Pants?  We have nothing.  I think we have nothing else to give our fine listeners, so maybe we can end with this today.  Okay.  I love Guess What's in My Pants.  You know how the game is played, Angel?  Yes, I do.  You take the telephone, you rub it on that nasty little area you women have between your legs,  and, you know, not through underwear.  It's got to be right there.  Right.  On that beautiful piece of real estate. 
[03:47:00]  And we will tell what type of hairstyle you have just on the sound that's coming out of  the phone.  So please, at no time, disclose to this show what you have between your legs until we ask  you what you have in your pants.  Okay.  We're going to play the theme song first.  Oh, of course we are.  Somebody was just about to get a punishment.  I looked after my pal.  I couldn't get in there fast enough for you, Anthony.  I wasn't going to have her do it.  I know the phone was punished.  I was a little nervous.  Somebody was going to be punished.  I don't like this. 
[03:47:30]  What?  You got everyone on edge.  Jimmy's holding some power over people, yeah?  You got everyone on edge now.  I don't like this.  Oh, no.  What are you guys doing now?  No.  Listen to the replay and you'll get it.  Let's hit the theme song.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[03:48:00]  It's time to guess what's in my pants.  My pants.  All right, Angel.  Now you listen to Anthony.  Okay.  Angel.  Yeah.  What are you wearing?  I actually just have underwear on.  I'm getting ready to go to work here.  Where are you?  I'm at home in the bathroom.  In the bathroom.  Anyone else home?  Nope.  No, huh?  Nope.  Great time for a home invasion.  Bust that door down.  She's in her undies.  She's almost asking for it. 
[03:48:30]  Okay.  Could you take your little undies off?  Okay.  No problem.  How old a gal are you?  I am 5'6".  She's 56 years old.  Now, how old are you?  I am 31.  And wait, 5'6", how much do you weigh?  About 125.  That's good.  She's great.  Short, blonde hair, green eyes.  It's not bad.  She would get kicked out of any self-respecting concentration camp, but it's not heavy by any. 
[03:49:00]  No, I would like it.  All right.  All right.  All right.  If you would take the telephone and rub it in an up-and-down fashion.  Okay.  Okay.  I so got it.  It's got that squishy sound that we hear sometimes.  Okay.  If you would now rub it side to side.  Okay.  Okay.  Do you hear that? 
[03:49:30]  I heard something there.  Okay.  Lastly, we love the circular motion.  Just a couple of laps around the track.  Okay.  Hold on.  Oh, that's going to change things. 
[03:50:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  All right.  Now it's our turn, Opie, to guess, based on what we've heard, what type of hair shoe sporting.  The choices, of course, are the basic standard issue triangle that most girls are issued with.  Factory install.  Factory install.  Factory install.  It's the basic what you start out with, and then you can hop it up from there.  Let's hear the options.  Then the options are the mohawk, which is shaved into a line up and down like a mohawk. 
[03:50:30]  Okay.  Landing strip, it's also called.  Then there's the Hitler mustache, which is like the landing strip, only it's a lot shorter from top to bottom.  It leaves a little Hitler mustache over the vag area.  And then all the rage, all the popular.  Guys love it.  It's clean, tidy, easy to work with.  The wood floor, the clean shaven, the JonBenet Ramsey.  All right.  Let's go to Norton first today.  Oh.  I think. 
[03:51:00]  Because I don't want to piss him off.  I like this because he tends to pick up on what we've done.  Notice I said let's go to Norton today because I know what the usual order is, but I don't want to read out of that stupid book.  I'm going to go with Hitler mustache.  That was the first thing I thought.  Wow.  No way.  All right.  Wood floor.  You're saying wood floor.  I'm saying standard issue.  I'm going to say standard issue.  Hitler.  So Hitler. 
[03:51:30]  Frenchie says Hitler.  Yeah.  He spoke up without being introduced.  He sure did.  He sure did.  Oh.  I might have to read a couple of lines out of Brent boys.  And then I sucked it.  He sure did.  Who's telling him he can talk, Jim?  No one introduced him.  No one said Frenchie's in the studio.  He just goes Hitler.  Hitler.  Hitler.  Some flashbacks from World War II.  Hitler.  Run, everyone.  Give your possessions to them.  And leave. 
[03:52:00]  All right.  We're going to get to Frenchie in a second.  All right.  So I said wood floor.  Hitler.  Hitler mustache.  And it.  I'm saying standard issue.  So let's go.  Angel.  If you would please tell us what is in your pants.  Okay.  It is just about a quarter size of hair just on the lip.  That's a Hitler mustache.  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton gets it.  Wow.  A Hitler mustache.  You're good.  Yeah.  You are good. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Norton would know.  Yeah.  I did.  I heard it.  And I didn't like the way Ope automatically went, no.  And kind of.  Now you've.  Oh, I'm not allowed to give my opinions anymore.  No, no.  You can give your opinions.  Okay.  But there's no need to blow out my candle to make yours shine brighter.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I just want to say the best day I ever listened to was when them poker chips went flying at  that girl.  Oh, God.  You should have been here for that.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  You've got to see the video because they show her and then you just see the chips fly by.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The video is up on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com. 
[03:53:00]  Oh, great.  I've got to ask Angel.  Why do you go with that Hitler mustache look?  Oh, because I figure if I shave off the lips, I'll probably be all cut up and look nasty.  So I just have never tried to shave it all off.  Yeah, but you know what that looks like when you're laying down?  Standing up with the legs together, it looks kind of cool.  It's a little, little patch of hair.  But when you lay down and the legs come apart, it just becomes this blotch, like this spot  of hair that really is distracting. 
[03:53:30]  Okay.  It has no rhyme or reason at that point.  There's no rhyme or reason.  It's separated from the actual plumbing.  It looks way too far away.  Yeah.  It's too far away from the plumbing and it's just this patch of hair.  It looks ridiculous.  And a pussy in your position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  All right, Angel.  I'll have to try and get rid of it all then for you.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thanks for playing Guess What's in My Pants.  Keep up the awesome work, man.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  Okay. 
[03:54:00]  It's time to play.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Guess What's in My Pants.  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Guess What's in My Pants.  It's time to guess.  What's in my pants.  My pants.  So you want to deal with French or what?  I don't like the way he just piped up without being introduced.  Hitler.  Do you have a passage for him? 
[03:54:30]  Coincidentally.  You do have a passage for him?  I have a passage for Eddie.  You have to stand over there because your mic's not on here.  Hearing a Frenchman read this will sound masculine.  It'll sound natural.  Yeah.  It's only one paragraph.  It's not that long because we're out of time.  One paragraph.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Frenchie.  Oh, my God.  This is the original Frenchie.  Yeah.  Not to be confused with the.  Pay attention to Opie or I'm going to make it longer.  With the improved version.  No, this is the old Frenchie.  This is the old Frenchie.  Now, Frenchie.  Yeah.  You got to play along.  You can't like. 
[03:55:00]  You have to read it serious.  I will.  Yeah.  The way you'd read it if you were alone on the toilet.  And this is.  If you're just tuning in, the replay is going to be pretty funny.  Norton explains this whole thing.  Norton has pretty much taken over the show with fucking gay literature.  Gay literature.  I don't know how the hell this happened, but.  Read it seriously like a half track full of Nazis just came into your home and told you  to leave.  Like you're reading off a list of names and telling people that their possessions will follow  them.  Want me to read this?  Yes.  Okay.  My legs dropped over his chest.  What's the name of the story? 
[03:55:30]  Oh.  Rent me down.  Rent me.  Rent to own.  Rent to own.  Yes.  Rent to own.  Atta boy.  All right.  Take it.  Take it slow.  You don't have to rush because you're going to make all kinds of mistakes if you rush.  It's only one paragraph.  Okay.  My legs dropped over his chest and his latex covered cock head pressed out against my entrance.  He grinded down at me and began slowly to edge his hips forward.  My eyes bulge at his wide knob began and penetrated me. 
[03:56:00]  Pain swept through his.  Did he really grind down stupid or he grinned down?  Grind.  How do you spell it?  Grind?  Yeah.  G-R-I-N-D.  Well, anyway, let me read.  Pain swept throughout my ass like a tidal wave.  My cock forgot that it was supposed to having sex and try to hide in my pubes. 
[03:56:30]  He stopped then.  The flange of his helmet just inside my...  What?  Spinster?  Oh, Spinster.  Oh, Spinster, baby.  Naughty baby.  Threatening the length of my virgin chute.  Spinster!  Oh, man.  Take a deep breath, Josh, and let me out...  No, let it out slow.  The blonde rent boy said, watching my face, all of it. 
[03:57:00]  Jesus Christ.  The blonde rent boy.  The blonde rent boy and co-host of popular radio show said...  Wrong.  You're a blonde rent boy.  Now, Finster.  It's Finster.  That dumb voice.  What the hell is this?  Shoot the hostage.  We don't have time to play.  What did we learn today, I guess, huh?  Well, Chris from Boston, I learned today, hey, guys, I learned never play any board games 
[03:57:30]  with Rich Voss and never read any book that has rent or boys in the title.  Thanks for getting the gay out, dicks.  Happy Anarchy from Staten Island.  I learned that Opie begged for his job with a tear in his eye.  Yes, I did.  Nick in Cleveland, I learned Norton gives 110% every day.  And Al Mack from Clifton today, I learned that Fallujah sounds like Nugent's house on  New Year's Eve.  Yes, we did learn that.  We're out?  Oh.  All right.  We got five seconds.  Oh, four? 
[03:58:00]  Three?  How many?  We got one?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, hold, hold, hold.  Bye.  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  Why is McDonald's still counting?  How insecure is this company?  Forty million, 80 jillion billion, so you kill you, tell you, tell you, tell you.  Is anyone really impressed anymore? 
[03:58:30]  Oh, 89 billion sold.  All right, I'll have one.  I'm satisfied.  Who cares?  I would love to meet the chairman of the board of McDonald's and just say to him, look,  we all get it.  Okay, you've sold a lot of hamburgers.  Whatever the hell the number is, just put up a sign, McDonald's, we're doing very well.  We are tired of hearing about every goddamn one of them. 
[03:59:00]  What is their ultimate goal?  To have cows just surrendering voluntarily or something?  Showing up at the door.  We'd like to turn ourselves in, we'll send a sign.  But otherwise, we have very little chance out there.  We'd like to be a happy meal if that's at all.  We'll send a sign. 
[03:59:30]  This is Willie.  Can I help you?  Yeah, my name is I live in a drive.  All right.  And I had made payment arrangements on my bill.  Yeah.  And I just got a shut-off notice today.  They shut you off?  Well, you got to pay your bill.  If you pay your bill, they won't shut you off.  You won't have to freeze your ass off.  Why don't you pay your damn bill?  I worked out payment arrangements. 
[04:00:00]  You didn't pay your bill, so you're going to freeze your ass off.  Now, whose fault is that?  That's your fault, not ours.  Just pay your damn bill.  Don't be a jive turkey.  Hey, man, I'm not, okay?  Don't get on my bad side.  I used to be a drill sergeant.  Don't get on my...  Dude, you don't need to be talking to me the way you're talking to me.  You didn't pay your bill.  You calling up...  I am working on paying the bill.  I make payment every Friday.  You don't need to hit no trash from nobody.  Come on.  I've been here since 7 o'clock this morning. 
[04:00:30]  I hate working on getting up early.  Just pay your bill.  You won't have to freeze your ass off.  What part don't you understand?  Now, what part don't you understand, okay?  I called the main office.  I worked out payment arrangements where I pay $100 every Friday.  Yeah, well, they shut you off because you didn't pay your damn bill.  They agreed with it, okay?  They agreed with that, and they said that is fine.  That's right.  I understand that. 
[04:01:00]  So why am I getting a shut-off notice for Friday?  You got to pay your bill.  I am working on paying my bill.  Well, you pay your damn bill.  Stop yakking and complaining.  Then I'll tell you how you...  Fuck you, asshole.  Yo, granny.  100 channels of crystal clear digital audio.  XM Satellite Radio.  Radio to the power of X.  XM Satellite Radio.
