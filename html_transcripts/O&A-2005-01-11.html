<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments.  The show began with a discussion of their recent interview with Billboard AirPlay Monitor, their relationship with Citadel's Farid Suleiman, and their reasons for staying with satellite radio instead of returning to terrestrial radio, citing creative freedom and broader reach.  This led into a segment mocking Howard Stern's apparent indifference towards them, repeatedly playing a bit where Stern says "I don't care."  They then dissected the media coverage of Randy Johnson's altercation with a CBS cameraman, noting the ubiquitous use of the same photo across major New York newspapers.  Celebrity gossip, particularly Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston's breakup and Pitt's relationship with Angelina Jolie, was also heavily discussed, interspersed with listener calls about other radio personalities (John and Jeff), a Gene Simmons anecdote, and a listener's suggestive use of the term "Java log."

The show transitioned to a debate on musical tastes, focusing on songs deemed "gay" or embarrassing. Artists like Cher, Madonna, Wang Chung, and Bryan Adams were discussed, alongside listener submissions and the hosts' own "guilty pleasures."  This segued into a discussion of a news story about a doctor's exposed genitals being shown on television during a flood rescue, which prompted a barrage of crude jokes from the hosts.  They then moved to discussing "Surreal Life" featuring Mini-Me, graphically detailing his drunken behavior, including urination and passing out, using highly derogatory language.  The segment concluded with an explicit discussion of "freak dancing" among high schoolers and a reminiscence of a previous Atlanta experience involving "Freak Nick," rife with racial slurs and stereotypes.

A significant portion focused on listener calls about experiences at amusement parks, particularly Six Flags Great Adventure.  These calls detailed aggressive behavior, line-cutting, and perceived racial dynamics, often accompanied by racial slurs and stereotypes from both the hosts and callers. The conversation also included an extensive discussion of Action Park, its dangerous nature, and accidents, with further use of racial slurs.  Listener anecdotes from various amusement parks across the country were shared.  The segment also touched on a prior appearance by two Playboy Radio hosts, disputing claims of intimidation, and featured a studio guest, comedian Chris Rush, who participated in the conversation. A caller engaged in a highly offensive exchange with Rush.  The hosts also mentioned an upcoming interview with Paul, a longtime friend recovering from a car accident and coma.  A commercial for a sex education video series aired during this segment.

Later, the show revisited their negative experience with the Playboy Radio hosts, criticizing their wit and offering sexually explicit commentary on their appearances.  This was followed by a call from Paul the Pilot, detailing his car accident, coma, and injuries in graphic detail. The rivalry with Howard Stern was again addressed, along with discussions about their show's ratings and opinions on women in radio.  Audio clips, including one of Verne Troyer ("Mini-Me"), were discussed for potential future use.  Sabrina Sikora, a Sports Illustrated model, was mentioned as a potential guest, but did not appear.

The final segment began with the hosts mocking someone's physique and continued with Anthony delivering a series of vulgar insults towards Marty Schottenheimer, his ex-girlfriend, and Jimmy Norton.  This was followed by listener calls, including one from Steve in San Diego who insulted Howard Stern. XM Satellite Radio advertisements aired, interspersed with a bizarre audio clip suggestive of sexual acts.  The conversation returned to Mini-Me's drinking problems and a request for comedian Pablo Francisco (initially mistaken for Pablo Picasso).  Sabrina, the Sports Illustrated model, joined the show, discussing her experience on the show, including negative comments from the judges and Jimmy Norton's behavior.  The show concluded with a "What Did I Learn?" segment from callers, interspersed with further vulgar comments from the hosts, followed by advertisements for a sex education video series, "Wow Stickers," and final plugs for XM Satellite Radio and the show itself.  Throughout the entire broadcast, there was extensive use of offensive language, racial slurs, and sexually explicit content.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And what's all the dropouts, who make their own rules?  What puts a position, for rule and control?  The media's hails in, and you live the road.  Mental wounds still screaming, finding me insane.  I'm going up the rails on a crazy train. 
[00:00:30]  I'm going up the rails on a crazy train.  I know that things are going wrong for me.  You've got to listen to my words.  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:03:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:05:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:06:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:06:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:07:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:07:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:08:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:08:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:09:00]  That's terrific. 
[00:09:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:10:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:10:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, a third grader can come up with that. 
[00:11:30]  You spend two hours. 
[00:12:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:12:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:13:00]  Well, why don't you read it. 
[00:13:30]  Listen to radio. 
[00:14:00]  Unquote, he says, 
[00:14:30]  Washington, Washington, Washington, Washington, Washington, Boston. 
[00:15:00]  that. You can't disagree with it.  But he ended every dramatic  thought  with, drive safely.  Shut up!  You just sit back and let Uncle Ted tell you, thank you very much.  Shut up! This is how it's  going to be, so drive safely.  Yeah.  You know, like, what are we,  just middle-of-the-road idiots?  Gee, good point, Ted. I didn't realize  the government does that. Thanks.  Yet you can't disagree with him.  He finds it incomprehensible 
[00:15:30]  that there is even another viewpoint  in some of his arguments.  Yeah, the next time he's on, we're going to have to  get someone that's way left  to kind of go out of the thing.  The left, though, can't argue with the right.  It just doesn't happen. It doesn't work.  The left really comes off looking like  sniveling little worms.  Unless you're a guy like Ron Cooby,  who's really, you've got to be that smart  to be able to pull off a liberal argument.  Believe me, I hope he falls  into a ditch, but I mean, he is a smart guy.  He's a good debater.  All right, Uncle Ted. 
[00:16:00]  Back to the exclusive interview  that Anthony did with Bill Boy Radio Monitor.  Kumia and co-host Greg Opie Hughes.  Greg, quote, Opie, unquote, Hughes.  That was my first radio name, by the way.  What?  Greg Opie Hughes.  The whole name.  You didn't just go with Opie  and you didn't go with Greg Hughes.  When I was on in Rochester,  when I was doing two for Tuesdays  in the four-play weekends,  I was Greg Opie Hughes.  Greg Opie Spuds Buckley Hughes.  This is Greg Opie Hughes  on your four-play weekend  where the fourth cut is always live. 
[00:16:30]  Here's Leonard Skinner.  Freebird.  Shut up!  I'm going to go spend the next 25 minutes  getting a blowjob from some slut  in the parking lot.  I'll be back.  Nice.  Absolutely.  And then the PD's like,  well, Greg Hughes would be a nice radio name  and Opie would be a nice radio name,  so you have to decide.  Really?  And I decided wrong  because now I'm stuck  with this stupid name.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Greg Opie Hughes, yeah.  Had been off terrestrial airwaves 
[00:17:00]  since 2002  when they were yanked  by Infinity Broadcasting.  Here it comes.  Our legacy, everyone.  Having sex in a vestibule  of St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Enough.  Opie and Anthony  became the first high-profile jocks  to sign on to satellite radio  and have been on XM since October.  The show that aired on WAQX  was an edited version  of the previous day's XM show.  The pair's relationship  with Citadel's chairman,  CEO, Farid,  Solomon,  is that his last name? 
[00:17:30]  Solomon, yeah.  Yeah.  Led to the two weeks  of ONA's airing in Syracuse.  Quote,  we've been on pretty good terms  with Farid  since he worked for Infinity,  Kumia says,  on what led them  to being heard on WAQX.  Quote,  we got along pretty well with him  and after our little fiasco  when we got the boot,  we still kept in touch with him.  He had always been offering us  jobs at his stations,  but Opie and I wanted to see  how it was going to play out.  We definitely wanted to return  to radio in New York  and a lot of the other 
[00:18:00]  big markets we were in.  We didn't want to be exclusive  to a couple of markets  in Pennsylvania,  New Orleans,  and Reno.  And that's what Farid  initially offered us, right?  We wanted to be  in the bigger markets  and where our fans were.  So that's what kept us  from signing on board  with Farid and Citadel.  Signing on board?  I would never say that.  It's either signing  or getting on board  or something.  You know,  you don't sign on board.  You say big a lot, though.  Big?  Yeah.  I know.  You like the word big  and bigger.  I didn't do the big. 
[00:18:30]  I'm looking forward to biggest.  Marcus, we were biggest.  Biggest.  Marcus, we were biggest.  No, I don't talk like that.  We want to be bigger.  Bigger.  We want to be in the big,  big markets we were big in  because it's bigger than big.  Yeah, we're bigger lovers.  You goddamn bigger.  The way the whole thing worked out  was pretty informal.  It was sort of a testing ground  for putting us back  on bigger terrestrial radio bigness. 
[00:19:00]  Suleiman and Stern  have been warring  since last year  when the five Citadel stations  airing station  Stern was airing on  began ending the show  abruptly at 10 a.m.  Suleiman stated  that Stern was promoting  his impending jump  to Sirius Satellite Radio  too much.  What, are you going to read  the whole thing?  Yeah.  Jesus.  No one highlighted it.  All right.  Well, that's all.  Then they mentioned  all the stations  that he was on  that Fareed took him off.  I just like your quotes.  And then it goes back  to Kumia says.  Kumia says, 
[00:19:30]  ONA were enjoying  their freedom on,  are enjoying their freedom  on XM  and don't want to give it up.  Quote,  we don't want to compromise  what we're doing  and we're pretty happy  with the show right now.  Kumia says,  it's quite a lot of freedom  when you don't have to worry  about the FCC on you.  Didn't say that like that.  We wouldn't want to compromise  that to get back  into terrestrial radio.  But we think other people,  we think,  and other people think,  Wow, you don't talk  like that at all.  that there is a way  to do this  that would put us on 
[00:20:00]  even live  and not compromise  what we're doing  with satellite.  No.  I don't talk like that.  God,  that guy has me  as a blithering idiot.  We think,  and other people think.  And other people think.  We're all thinking.  That's still got to be  hashed out  with whoever  we decide to work with.  I probably did say  hashed out.  Yeah, you like that.  You like the word hashed.  That's got to be  bigly hashed out  in a big way.  All right.  Markets,  we were big.  Among the other options,  Kumia discussed 
[00:20:30]  is talking about  more risque subject matter  on XM  during terrestrial commercial breaks  or having a long delay  that would allow stations  to punch out of material  they might find offensive.  Story is still pending,  but getting a lot of press,  Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of press these days.  That was my interview  on my cell phone  from my big suite  at the MGM Grand.  Oh.  Just sitting there  kicking my feet up,  watching a little TV.  I think I had  Team America on.  Yeah?  With the puppet sex?  Oh, the puppet sex. 
[00:21:00]  One of the best scenes  in movie history.  When the puppet  is giving the girl puppet  the pile driver?  The pile driver.  It's the funniest  goddamn scene  in a movie.  I can't wait  to get the DVD.  You know that DVD  is going to be good.  Oh, yeah.  Because there's supposed  to be extra sex scenes  between the puppets.  Well, yeah.  That sex scene  was supposed to be  twice as long,  but Hollywood was like,  oh, my God,  you can't have puppet sex.  Blah, blah, blah.  All right, well,  if you cut it in half,  we won't give you  an X rating  or whatever the hell  they were going to give it.  It's supposed to be  a tender, sensitive moment  between the two characters 
[00:21:30]  that are, of course,  played by puppets,  and they start out kissing  and just like they show  the bed scene.  That's why it's so brilliant.  Well, they were kissing  with the sun going down  because that's what movies show,  the nice romance.  Right, the romance.  And then they're in bed  and you kind of see the covers  and they're under the covers  and it just mutates  into this hardcore puppet sex.  He's got the back of her head  pumping up and down  in his crotch.  But that's the reality.  It's hysterical.  It starts with a nice dinner  and a sunset  and ends with the wheelbarrow.  The wheelbarrow. 
[00:22:00]  The wheelbarrow on her hands,  you holding up her legs  and walking around the room  with your penis in her.  He's holding her ankles.  She's doing a handstand.  He's just pounding down on her.  Hysterical.  Oh, that's wonderful.  America!  Getting back to the Howard thing,  you know the thing  we've been playing by chemistry?  Because Howard doesn't  really care about us,  doesn't care that we're  potential replacements  for a lot of his markets  all over the country.  Yeah, and that we did  pop on one of his stations. 
[00:22:30]  And he has spent a lot of time  telling his audience  that he just doesn't care about us.  I don't care.  Well, you heard this yesterday, right?  They replaced us with  Opie and Anthony  while we were,  you know, like the,  the, their...  Yeah, I mean, yeah,  I go, well, well,  I don't even know why they're...  I don't...  I said, this doesn't...  They think I give a crap  about Opie and Anthony.  I don't...  Yeah, I mean, yeah,  I go, well, well,  I don't care.  They think I give a crap.  I don't care.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  Why would,  why would I care?  I don't care.  I said, this doesn't...  Yeah, I mean, yeah,  I go, well, well,  I don't care.  Say, I don't care.  I don't care.  Opie and Anthony.  I don't care.  Opie and Anthony.  I don't care.  Opie and Anthony.  I don't even know  why you're involved  with me like this.  I don't care.  He just doesn't care, Anthony.  See, the funny part about that is,  you mentioned the people  you care about.  I don't care. 
[00:23:30]  There are so many people  that I don't care about.  I couldn't even tell you  their names  because I don't care.  Yeah, because when you don't care,  you just don't give it  a second thought.  Right.  And you don't discuss it  every day  for 20, 30 minutes  at a clip.  So, you know us,  we're like, you know,  just ass wipes, so...  Pests, as Norton  so eloquently put it.  So I came up  with an idea here.  Pests.  I just got to set it up.  Okay.  Pestilence.  So, um...  What, you're pulling me  off the air.  All right, now we got this. 
[00:24:00]  I don't care.  I don't care.  My jokes don't go over.  I don't care.  What, you're pulling me  off the air.  I don't care.  Then they did a stunt  where they replaced us  with Opie and Anthony  while we were, you know,  like their best of show.  And I go,  why would I care?  You can replace me  with whatever you want.  Yeah, that's a fire right now.  It's not even going to be so close.  Yeah, I mean, yeah,  I go, why would that  even offend me?  The only thing you're going to  offend is a bunch of  church-going people  who are upset about  how they got pulled off the air. 
[00:24:30]  I said, this doesn't get to me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't even know why  you're involved with me like this.  No, I don't care.  They think I give a crap  about Opie and Anthony  or Man Cow  or any of these guys.  I don't care.  Put them all on.  I don't care.  You know, I just don't.  Put them all on.  I mean, I've seen  what they can do.  Fareed thinks he's going to put,  like, Opie and Anthony on.  I'm going to get all upset about it  and that's going to make me  somehow twist in the wind. 
[00:25:00]  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  This is stupid.  You're not doing comedy.  You're aggravating people.  There you go.  Because we are asses.  Ah, Kevin Meany.  Yeah, Kevin Meany.  Ah, I don't care. 
[00:25:30]  Boom, boom, boom.  That just makes me giggle, man.  All right.  We should go to the phone  and see what's going on today.  What's going on, America?  A couple phone calls.  I don't know what to do.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Got it?  Yeah, I guess.  What the?  I don't have instant feedback today, Anthony,  so hopefully you'll be eyeing  the instant feedback  very closely today.  All right.  Chris from New Orleans.  What's up, Chris?  Chris?  Yellow. 
[00:26:00]  Yellow.  You got to push that button.  All right.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, if I have to hear Howard Stern  say I don't care one more time,  I'm going to go into fucking compulsion.  I don't care.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The reason I was calling  is because I was listening  to John and Jeff,  those pipshits from Los Angeles.  Oh, we told you guys  to check them out  on one of the XM channels.  Yeah, I did that.  And I want to tell you,  I could only handle listening to them  for five minutes  until I was just ready  to bust my fucking radio. 
[00:26:30]  They were talking,  they were supposed to be  a comedy channel,  and they were talking  about sexual situations  that you have  whenever you're a problem.  They had guys calling in  saying they were sexually molested  by the father.  And then, like,  the next minute,  the next minute,  they're talking about  what to do with the things  that you get that don't work  that you got during Christmas.  A complete waste of time.  Oh.  Things that don't work  that you got at Christmas. 
[00:27:00]  Like, give us an example of that.  Well, they had one guy  that called in and said,  well, my radio that I got  doesn't work.  What should I do?  Take it back.  The answer is,  put it on their show,  and you'll be grateful  it's broken.  Well, that's the comedic stylings  of John and Jeff, I guess.  Enjoy.  You guys are funny, man.  It was complete nothingness.  I don't care about John and Jeff.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  I just don't care.  Hey, thank you.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  Let me, uh,  Jason has a problem with me.  Jason in New Hampshire,  what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, last week, Opie,  you, uh,  you did the same thing  about I don't care.  Lady Di called in  to say hi to the show.  Right.  And then carried on  for like 20 minutes.  I don't care.  Were you saying I don't care  a lot, Opie?  Uh-oh, you might have  to get that rant.  I'm going to have  to pull that clip.  Pull that clip,  and we'll play the Kevin  Meany over that again.  You really do care  about Lady Di,  don't you,  see?  We knew you had it in you.  I do care. 
[00:28:00]  I'll tell you,  I do care as far as,  you know,  getting good radio out of her.  Definitely I care.  You know,  she has given us  good stuff in the past,  and if we could exploit her  to get good radio,  yes,  I truly care about that.  Sure.  That's the difference,  but as a human being,  I could care less about her.  Yeah.  And also,  I heard somebody  calling a John and Jeff  about that little Connor.  It was great.  What did you say?  Oh, really great.  I don't remember.  It was last week,  but he just,  he carried on  the normal little  little Connor way, 
[00:28:30]  and they had no clue  what he was talking about.  That's great.  It was awesome.  You guys suck.  All right,  thank you.  Those guys are funny, man.  This might have been  one of the guys  that did it, actually.  Jim from Tennessee.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, I heard that.  It was last Thursday,  like at around 5 o'clock.  I can stand  about 15 minutes of it,  but what it was  is this guy calls in  from PA,  and he says  that his name is Mike,  and that they were  talking about women  that had been sexually 
[00:29:00]  abused by their fathers,  and he said  he was dating a girl,  and her name was Lacey,  and he liked her child,  and her child's name  was Connor,  and he just didn't  understand why  that in the backyard  he had a boat,  and she was horrified of it,  and he didn't know,  and these tools  actually gave this guy  advice on it  for about 15 minutes.  That's funny.  I mean,  they just kept on  and on and on, 
[00:29:30]  and oh, man,  it was flair.  And the guy even mentioned  her giving him  oral treats,  and he called it  Monster Rain.  I swear to God.  Someone has to get us  the tape of that.  It came on last Thursday  at about 5 o'clock  in the morning.  Really?  If someone has that tape,  please send it  into the program.  That's really funny.  It was fucking hilarious.  That's great.  All right, Jim,  thank you.  All right, bud.  Bye.  I'm starting to recognize,  Jim.  He calls the program a lot.  Yeah, he got that voice. 
[00:30:00]  Come on, boys.  All right,  why don't we take  our first break?  We got to talk about  Randy Johnson  when we get back.  Aw, you know,  why are people  giving him a hard time?  You know.  Well, we'll get into it  after the break.  And also,  Neil Cavuto  wants us on TV today.  We'll explain  and decide,  I guess,  live on the show  if we should do it or not.  Your world,  Cavuto,  wants us on.  And as we go to break,  once again, Anthony,  my darling,  my blood.  I don't know.  All right,

[00:33:00]  All in all, you're just a  never-breaking go-off.  Okay, terrific.  Pardon my French,  but you're an asshole.  You're checking out  the Opie and Anthony program  on XM Satellite Radio.  Hello.  We got Gene Simmons,  limo driver on the line here.  Do we know what he wants?  We'll go with it,  see what's going on here.  Let's say hi to Haas in Vegas. 
[00:33:30]  Haas, what's up, buddy?  Oh, no, no, no.  It's looking at the print lights  as I drive through Vegas, bud.  All right.  Hey, uh,  this is the thing you're talking  about Lady Di and Howard.  I just had a brainstorm.  Why don't you put the two  of them together?  Both of them fucking losers  can go look for a job.  Oh, boy, that's terrific.  That's terrific.  Shut up!  Hey, uh, you were talking  yesterday about, uh,  the kiss, about Gene Simmons. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy, uh, hold on.  Let me, because people are  turning on their radios every day.  Uh, Jimmy, really not a big fan  of Gene Simmons all of a sudden,  even though he grew up  pretty much idolizing the guy.  But just because Gene Simmons  didn't give him a picture  while we were out in Vegas,  now, uh, now Jimmy hates him.  No, that's not completely accurate.  It's because he was so dismissive  once he found out,  even though I was on the show,  and then when he said, uh,  walk, walk, and we'll do the,  I walked with him,  and he couldn't stop for one second.  That's for Bob.  For one second.  Yeah, and he knew that 
[00:34:30]  we had just interviewed the guy  a week ago.  Yeah.  You know, it's like,  sorry, I can't hoard your products  here in the Venetians, stupid.  So, sorry, all right, just to, go ahead.  All right, Haas.  You know, he, uh,  well, I drove a limo for five years,  and he's one that sticks in my mind  very much,  because, like, like you said,  he's really an arrogant, pompous person.  And, uh, like the,  they were supposed to take the limo  from their stand,  from their little trailer  to the stage,  and he was raising hell about it.  He was just,  I just want to walk, you know? 
[00:35:00]  And I, the guy that dresses  like a pussycat told me  to shut up, he wants more  than an old bitch.  I'm punching out.  All right, be good.  Oh, wow.  What a great call.  That call had so many problems.  My God, man.  He actually made Gene look better.  He didn't want the cushy limo.  He wanted to walk.  Yeah, I know.  What was that?  Yeah.  The guy's trying to make Gene  sound like an idiot.  Right, maybe he,  and he goes,  oh, he didn't want to take the limo.  He wanted to walk. 
[00:35:30]  Wow, what a jackass.  Maybe Gene couldn't handle  all the bad jokes  this guy was giving him.  Yeah, really.  Pull over, I'm walking.  Surprised Gene didn't fly  because he's dressed like a bat.  Oh, very nice.  Anthony, so we were just  getting into it before the break.  The Randy Johnson story is huge.  Oh, they're playing this thing  like over and over and over.  The New York Post,  I got to tell you, man.  I used to really think  it was a newspaper.  Yeah, it's not.  They finally lost me  because they don't put any news  on the front page anymore. 
[00:36:00]  No.  The other day,  there was a big, huge picture  of Brad and Jennifer  because they broke up.  And now today,  the front page is Randy Johnson  kind of giving a cameraman  some shit.  Yeah, and then,  did you see the back page too?  Of course, the sports section.  They got to do these  wacky Photoshop things.  It's not even news.  Look at this.  They put Randy Johnson  in like, I don't know,  some kind of Jedi attire. 
[00:36:30]  Is that what it is?  Is he Darth Vader  without the mask?  I don't know.  I think he's supposed to  look like Obi-Wan Kenobi  or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's more of an Obi thing.  Sure.  Yeah.  And then they got a,  what's his face there?  And then they got a lightsaber  in between them?  Picked up for the Mets.  Oh, he's holding  kind of a lightsaber bat, right?  What's his name?  Beltran.  Carlos Beltran?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm glad that that's got him.  Good.  They got him holding a bat  that looks like a lightsaber  and he's swinging that around. 
[00:37:00]  And, of course,  the headline there  is Star Wars  because they're both stars.  Oh.  Oh.  Just awful.  This paper is just  so gimmicky.  And front page,  Randy Johnson  with the headline  Big Jerk.  Isn't it great  to see other people  get headlines like that,  Opie?  Yeah, it really is.  Big Jerk.  Jackasses.  They fired all those  producers from CBS.  Yes, for 60 Minutes.  60 Minutes.  And they have their photos  and Anthony was making  a good point before the show. 
[00:37:30]  You never want your picture  in the paper  with the word  fired over it.  Fired, yeah.  That's exactly what  has happened to us  twice now  in major newspapers.  But it's really fun  to see someone else's face  with the word fired.  Yeah.  It's kind of fun.  Yeah, they had those  four CBS executives  that got fired,  their faces,  and then Big Fired.  And we know how that feels.  It's not fun,  but it certainly is fun  when it's other people.  It really is.  He's fired.  So anyway,  Randy Johnson,  the front page of the Post  has his hand up. 
[00:38:00]  Uh-huh.  How's the story go?  He was getting a physical?  He walked him with security  to his physical.  Right.  And I guess the CBS cameraman  saw him  and started taping him  and saying,  he said like,  hey, buddy,  he's going to get some quotes  out of him or something.  And Randy didn't want  to be photographed.  Well, the guy said to him,  how do you feel  about being in New York?  And Randy Johnson said,  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
[00:38:30]  I don't care.  Yep.  The big unit,  uh,  got a little angry.  I think we have audio  of it, actually.  Hmm.  Um,  so who's at fault here,  do you think?  I'm going to blame.  I think the cameraman,  you know,  we know the camera people  can be passing all that,  but it wasn't like  he was up in the,  up in Randy's face.  He was giving him  some space  and just kind of  filming him  as he was walking,  you know,  toward his physical,  I guess.  Did, uh,  did,  did Randy say like,  I don't want to be photographed 
[00:39:00]  or right away  did he go for the camera?  I forgot.  He said, uh,  he did say,  look,  don't take my picture.  The six foot 10 Johnson  snarled at the new shutterbug.  Don't take my,  the shutterbug.  And then he said,  don't follow me,  Johnson Warren.  Don't follow me.  I don't know.  Look,  as much as I despise  the media photographer  sometimes,  guy's making 32 million  and it's just like,  he's going to make  the Yankee announcement.  What do you think?  You're going to sneak in  incognito?  Idiot.  You're 6'10".  Big,  yeah,  big guy.  Yeah,  there's a lot of,  there's a lot of interest 
[00:39:30]  so they're going to follow him  around for a while now,  you know?  Six foot 10  and he's making 32 million.  You think no one's going to notice  when you traipse  into the physical?  These celebrities have to,  the first day in New York.  Well,  these celebrities have to deal  with this,  you know,  they want,  they want the coverage  and the photographers  and the cameramen  when it's something really cool  that they're promoting  but they don't want  that same stuff  when,  you know,  it's something as boring as this  or when you get in trouble.  They just want it one way.  It just doesn't work that way.  If you're in the public eye,  you're in the public eye. 
[00:40:00]  Like it or not.  Yeah.  And there's going to be,  you know,  paparazzi,  you know,  taking your picture  and trying to get a picture  of you coming out of a club  or something  or whatever.  You know what this is going to do now?  They are just going to pound him.  That's how the press is.  And the New York press  is the worst.  This,  they see now  that this guy  is a little angry  with the press.  They are going to put cameras  in his face  every minute of every day  to try to get him to react.  And,  I don't know,  this guy does seem like  kind of a prick.  Dude,  all three major newspapers 
[00:40:30]  in New York  have his stupid hand.  That's the front page.  It's his big,  long-fingered hand.  Oh,  the Daily News  put it on their front page, too?  Pitching a fit.  It all has a baseball tie.  Look at Newsday.  The same one.  Newsday's got the biggest hand  of them all.  They really zoomed in on that.  That's what makes news  these days, you know?  Randy Johnson,  it's really not that big  of a deal.  He just didn't want  to be photographed.  He puts his hand up  and kind of pulls  the camera down.  And then there's  a slight argument  and that's that.  Yeah.  It wasn't like,  you know,  he assaulted the cameraman 
[00:41:00]  or anything like that.  No,  but the cameramen  do not like  when you handle  their camera.  No.  They do not like that.  And the guy got pissed off.  I mean,  there's just no way  that some six-foot-eight  arrogant asshole  who's really skinny  is going to do well  in New York.  Wait.  Oh,  very nice.  Well,  here's the Randy Johnson.  And check out  the end of this clip  because the cameraman  is just a sarcastic prick.  The Yankees' newest pitcher  is getting off  to an interesting start  in New York,  say the least. 
[00:41:30]  Things got physical  when CBS2 cameras  caught up with Randy Johnson  today and CBS2's  Duke Castiglione  here now to show us  just what happened, Duke.  Yeah, Michael,  it was interesting.  I mean,  earlier this morning  we caught up  with a five-time  Cy Young Award winner,  Randy Johnson,  as he walked  with Yankees security  to get his physical.  Now,  I asked him for an interview.  He said no.  Our cameraman,  Vinny Everett,  tried to get some shots  of him walking.  And that's when  Johnson got upset.  Watch and listen.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, how you doing? 
[00:42:00]  Hey.  All right.  No cameras, man.  What is that?  What is that?  No cameras.  You got my face,  that's all I asked.  It's not going to fix you.  No, you're not.  No cameras.  No cameras.  I got him, Randy.  I got him.  All right?  Don't get in my face.  I don't care who you are.  Don't get in my face.  He's taking a picture.  Don't get in my face  and don't talk back to me,  all right?  All right.  Come on, Randy.  Welcome to New York.  Welcome to New York.  The cameraman's like,  welcome to New York.  This is going to be a curse 
[00:42:30]  now every day,  you big dork.  Did he say,  don't talk back to me?  Yeah, that's the thing  that is just going to  seal his fate.  Now everyone's going to  think he's an asshole.  Don't talk back to me.  Don't talk back to me?  Don't take my picture.  I was just taking it,  but don't talk back to me.  Don't talk back to me?  What a douche.  Yeah, that's not going to  play well.  You're not going to beat  the New York media.  He'll fit in perfectly.  This is great.  The media is salivating at this.  They will be on his doorstep.  Good.  They will follow him 
[00:43:00]  everywhere now,  trying to get him to react.  They will stick cameras  in his face  everywhere he goes.  If he just would have  smiled and said,  it probably wouldn't  even have made the news.  It would have been  a two-second clip  of him just kind of,  how you doing?  I'm walking down the street.  Yeah, not right now, guys.  There's a way  to blow them off.  There really was nothing to it.  The guy was going to  film them for 30 seconds  just walking on a sidewalk  and they were going to  show it on TV.  They probably wouldn't  even have showed it on TV.  And what was that?  The cameraman goes,  I'm just taking your picture. 
[00:43:30]  And he goes,  no, you're not.  He's like,  I have a camera here.  Yes, I am.  I'm taking your picture.  Yeah, I'm pretty much  just taking your picture.  Let me see that  Daily News again.  Sure.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  Don't talk back to me.  Don't talk back to me.  Isn't that a song?  No.  Don't talk back.  I don't care.  He didn't care  the camera was in his face.  He didn't care.  He just didn't care.  He didn't care.  So the camera's in the face.  Big deal.  Anyway, so that's 
[00:44:00]  the big story in New York.  I mean, we're done  with that tsunami crap.  It's over.  Yeah.  This is much more  important, Randy Johnson.  Oh, of course.  This is why it's  got to be front page.  Of course.  I hear they just found  1,500 more dead people.  Yeah, they're just going  In like one spot.  Yeah, they're just going  to all these little islands  over there,  and they're finding  a lot more people.  And, ah,  that's old news now.  No, big jerk.  That's what you need.  Yeah, they'll clean that  and mess up.  Ah, we don't need  to worry about that anymore. 
[00:44:30]  It's all about  Randy Johnson today  in New York.  When is the last time  all three New York  papers like that  had the same picture  on the cover?  I would love to know  when the last time,  like whenever you  piss somebody in the media  off by not giving them  what they want,  that's what they do.  I'd love to know  when the last time  that happened was.  It's the same,  not just the same  scene or story,  the same exact picture.  Exact same photo.  Yeah.  Just, yeah,  one's a little larger,  that's about it,  but.  Yeah, so when was  the last time?  That's their idea  of showing solidarity.  That's a message  they send out.  Son of Sam arrest?  What the hell  was the last time  that was done?  Yeah, it's ridiculous. 
[00:45:00]  Speaking of caring  and not caring,  Neil Cavuto,  he wants us on  his TV show so bad.  He does that thing  on the Fox News channel,  I guess.  Yeah.  And every time  there's some kind  of story,  maybe about indecency  on the radio  or the Janet Jackson thing  or just anything  about pop culture,  he's always calling us,  and he wants us  to do an interview today.  Mm-hmm.  But he wants us  to talk about  the breakup  of Brad and Jennifer.  What the hell 
[00:45:30]  would we...  I know.  That's what I said.  And he wants us  to take the angle,  why do we care?  I don't care.  I don't care.  Boom, boom, boom.  Boom, boom.  The problem is  we don't care,  and that's why  we will not be doing  the Neil Cavuto interview today.  I don't even care  enough to go on  to not care.  Right.  You can't go on  and say you don't really care  as you're on TV  talking about  how you don't care.  Yeah, yeah.  So he goes into  that whole I don't care  thing again.  You can't make a big deal,  a television appearance  to tell people 
[00:46:00]  how much you don't care  about something.  Could you imagine  if we did that?  Maybe we should.  We go on  to talk about  how we don't care?  Yeah, Neil,  we're on your show  to let you know  that we truly  just don't care.  We don't care.  I don't care, Neil.  I don't care if you like us.  We don't like you.  And guess what?  I don't care.  I don't care.  Your son could die  in a house.  All right, hold on.  Get that back.  Wow.  You've got to do it  the right way.  That guy did call me 
[00:46:30]  out in New Hampshire.  They must have really  noticed that.  All right, we've got  to work together.  So this is a clip  from last week  talking to the drunk  Lady Di.  She's telling us  about her horrendous life  and I was basically  telling her I don't care.  You don't care.  Let's hear Opie not care.  Hold on, we've got to  start with the Kevin Meany  thing first.  I don't care.  I don't care if you like us.  We don't like you.  And guess what?  I don't care.  I don't care.  Your son could die 
[00:47:00]  in a house fire.  I wouldn't even care.  Do you understand?  Do you understand me?  I don't care about anything  to do with you.  I don't care if you like me.  I don't give a fuck  if you like me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He doesn't care.  I don't care.  You guys suck.  I don't care.  I don't care.  One more time.  No.  I don't care.  No.  Shut up.  You guys stink, man. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Opie didn't care.  It sounded a lot like,  you know,  who who.  I don't care.  I don't care.  They put on Opie and Anthony.  I don't care.  Opie and Anthony.  Shut up.  You guys shut up.  Speaking of which,  because we like to pound things  into the ground.  Of course we do.  I got another version.  Actually,  I want to play for everybody today.  Gotta do this.  Do that.  Do this.  Do this.  What you're pulling me off the air. 
[00:48:00]  Then they did a stunt where they replaced us with Opie and Anthony while we were, you know,  like their best stuff show.  And I go,  why would I care?  You can replace me with whatever you want.  And that's the primary knowledge that it doesn't come close.  Yeah,  I mean,  yeah,  I go,  why would that even offend me?  The only thing you're going to offend is a bunch of churchgoing people who are upset about how they got pulled off the air. 
[00:48:30]  I said,  this doesn't get to me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't even know why you're involved with me like this.  They think I give a crap about Opie and Anthony or Mankow or any of these guys.  I don't care.  Put them all on.  You know,  I just don't put them all on.  I mean,  I've seen what they can do.  For Reed thinks he's going to put my Opie and Anthony on them. 
[00:49:00]  He's going to get all upset about it.  And that's going to make me somehow twist in the wind.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  Now that's just funny,  you know,  but in the old days we would be in a closed office somewhere getting yelled at because we're making people laugh.  Well,  they can't do that to us anymore.  Thank God.  All right.  Well,  now let's play my rant. 
[00:49:30]  The Ramones.  Yeah,  the Ramones.  You got that queued up again,  Dirk?  All right.  Hold on.  Sounds very similar.  I don't care if you like us.  We don't like you.  And guess what?  I don't care.  I don't care.  Your son could die in a house fire.  I wouldn't even care.  Do you understand?  Do you understand me?  I don't care about anything to do with you. 
[00:50:00]  I don't care if you like me.  I don't give a fuck if you like me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  It's pretty similar,  man.  Anyway.  All right.  Well,  there you have that.  Someone's going to answer your question,  Anthony.  I think this is the wrong answer,  by the way,  but we'll go with it. 
[00:50:30]  Eric from Pennsylvania.  What's up,  Eric?  Oh,  hold on.  See,  you got to move buttons around.  All right.  Say that again,  Eric.  I'm going to let you guys know when the last time the newspapers had the same picture on the cover.  Okay.  It might have been September 11th.  Oh,  that could have been.  No,  maybe.  There had to be one since then.  Maybe.  Love you,  I mean,  love you,  Master Poe.  Bye,  sweetie.  He loves Master Poe.  Did they say love you,  Jaime?  Yeah.  Love you,  Master Poe.  Who's Jaime?  You don't know who Jaime is?  Jaime.  Jaime. 
[00:51:00]  Jaime's great.  Yes,  he is.  A huge defender of the Opie and Anthony program.  Jaime.  Eric from Maryland.  What's up,  Eric?  Hey,  Opie,  I don't think you should get caught with the same thing that they're doing to Howard,  because you had Lady Di on the phone when you were doing that.  I mean,  you were actually saying it to her face.  It's a huge difference between that and what Howard's doing.  Well,  I mean,  I really don't care about it.  I can't even use that phrase anymore.  Yeah,  now everybody's going to be all gun shy for saying,  I don't care.  I really don't care about her personal life. 
[00:51:30]  I do care about making good radio out of Lady Di,  without a doubt.  Yes.  So in that way,  you do care.  Yes,  exactly.  But her personally,  don't care.  No,  I don't really care about her.  You don't give it any thought during the day.  Not at all.  When she hangs up that phone,  do you even think about Lady Di?  I kind of forget her name.  Right.  Like,  wait,  who's that drunk that calls a show that's,  you know.  Don't care.  Friends with Marion.  Oh yeah,  Lady Di.  Yeah.  I have to think about it a little bit.  Yeah.  But you know,  that off the air, 
[00:52:00]  he's actually thinking about this show,  and how it much,  it annoys him that we were put on.  Oh yeah,  over and over again.  On the air.  Yeah.  All right.  Speaking of which,  Anthony,  man,  you're making news all over the place.  Well,  what happened?  Well,  we just read your Billboard Monitor interview,  your exclusive interview.  Exclusive.  Billboard Monitor,  or AirPlay Monitor,  whatever.  And now the Daily News has quotes from that.  Oh,  stop.  In the New York paper.  Really?  Anthony Cumia of Opian Anthony tells Billboard AirPlay Monitor, 
[00:52:30]  it would be a no-brainer for stations that drop Howard Stern to substitute a broadcast-friendly  version of the O&A show.  Oh,  my quote makes it in.  Makes it into the New York paper.  Congrats.  Congratulations.  Great.  I don't care.  So,  getting back to the Brad and Jennifer thing,  we're not going on Neil Cavuto to talk about Brad and Jennifer, right?  No,  why would we do that?  And the papers are starting to hint at the fact that he may have been kind of hooking up  with Angelina Jolie,  who's just built for sex.  Let's be honest with each other. 
[00:53:00]  Now,  that we care about Angelina Jolie.  Oh,  yeah,  we do.  Yeah,  we do.  I guess they were filming a movie together and getting a little too close.  That's got to be a bitch,  man.  It doesn't matter who you are,  who you're married to.  He's got a piece of ass.  I think Jennifer Aniston is really hot,  you know?  And he goes off to make a movie with Angelina Jolie.  Yeah.  It happens all the time.  Especially in Hollywood.  Actors and actresses,  they hook up.  You can't,  look at the scenes in these movies.  Well,  you know,  it starts with the casting of these movies where they try to find two people that have a nice chemistry. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  And usually,  let's say that the guy has a marriage or whatever,  or a girlfriend,  and the female actress there also has a significant other.  Right.  But some casting director gets these people together because they think they have good chemistry.  So right there,  there's danger.  And then they go off to like the middle of nowhere to film a movie on location for six months.  You'll figure out what's going on.  Exotic locations where so much of the time you spend is downtime. 
[00:54:00]  Like movies,  it takes forever because a lot of the time they're not shooting.  You're waiting for shots and you're bored.  Now you're two people,  good chemistry,  attractive people,  bored out of your mind.  In the middle of the jungle somewhere.  In the middle of nowhere.  Hey,  want to take a walk?  I don't know.  And since you're the romantic interest in the movie,  you've had a couple of scenes that already have broken the ice where you're kissing,  rolling around in bed naked.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  I mean,  you know,  the ice is broken.  Right. 
[00:54:30]  Oh no,  but it's just acting.  But it's acting.  Stop it.  Yeah,  I'm not feeling it when she's naked on top of me.  Exactly.  Are you insane?  Oh no,  it's Angelina Jolie's huge luscious cans rubbing against me.  Her lips and yeah,  right.  No,  we're acting.  There's nothing here.  So now you're in the trailer,  maybe at night.  Right.  Now you're drinking a little bit,  winding down from the day's shoot.  You start talking and you're spending months together.  On top of that.  Months together making these movies.  On top of that,  you haven't popped a nut in, 
[00:55:00]  you know,  a few weeks or a month because your chick's back in Hollywood.  She's kissing some other guy on some movie set.  Right.  It's ridiculous to think that these people can actually have these relationships when they're  doing these love scenes.  It just can't happen.  And don't think that they don't recognize how famous the other person is.  I don't think he's not thinking,  I'm actually banging Angelina Jolie.  Right.  And she's going,  oh,  Brad Pitt.  I'm drinking out of Brad's Mule.  Yeah,  right.  They are.  And you know,  exactly.  And,  uh,  Brad Pitt,  you know,  he's a more of a hometown boy and he wants to,  he wants to be a father. 
[00:55:30]  I read up on this stuff,  Anthony,  just for the show.  Actually,  because we had a six hour freaking flight and you know,  what else were we going to read?  And,  uh,  you know,  he's like,  he comes from a small family in the middle of nowhere,  hometown boy,  you know,  and,  uh,  he,  he wants to be a father and you see Angelina Jolie,  this piece of ass that definitely is motherly and wants to,  to start a family or he has started a family.  Didn't even wait for the dude.  Just went out and,  you know,  um,  adopted Max.  Not like Baron Jennifer Aniston's,  huh?  Not like Baron Jennifer Aniston's uterus. 
[00:56:00]  Jennifer Aniston is the type of girl that just doesn't want her body ruined.  Is that it?  Or I,  I heard like they were trying.  Oh really?  This is our gossip segment.  Where's Ben?  With this guy.  I know.  Brad was doing coke with Tom Brady.  Couldn't keep erections.  Hey,  how do we know so much about Brad and Jennifer,  but I,  I guess,  you know,  I couldn't even tell you that.  I couldn't even tell you the town that the tsunami hit.  I couldn't name three freaking areas that the tsunami hit, 
[00:56:30]  but I could tell you all about,  uh,  Jennifer Aniston and her,  and her barren womb.  It's our American culture,  man.  It just kind of seeps in.  It seeps in there,  you know,  and you kind of know things that you'd never even tried to know.  Are you trying to say that Brad Pitt's tsunami hit dry land?  I think so.  He was,  he was not,  Hey,  I,  I think they were trying to get pregnant and it just wasn't panning out.  And perhaps that added,  you know,  he sees that Angelina Jolie's nice fertile womb, 
[00:57:00]  staring at right in the face,  probably.  And,  uh,  what are you going to know?  I can't see how these relationships ever last,  you know,  unless you get one of those,  who has one that actually works?  Tom Hanks and his wife.  Rita Wilson's not that famous though,  compared to,  right.  She's not that famous.  And he's not doing these like scenes like that.  Right.  He's not really bedding down with people,  you know,  she's not going to catch him tickling Kevin Bacon's bag. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  And Harris.  And Harris,  Jesus.  You know,  but you get somebody like,  uh,  Brad Pitt,  Angelina Jolie.  Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw works out nicely.  Cause there you go.  We all know who the big one in that relationship is.  Uh huh.  She does her little parts.  Sure.  Go ahead.  Sure.  Do a little part.  Go ahead.  I'll put you in one of my movies.  What actor would try to bang Spielberg's wife?  That's not a career move that you want to make.  That wouldn't be a smart thing to do,  right?  Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon.  Yeah, 
[00:58:00]  they work.  That's a good couple.  Yeah.  She's already hit the wall,  so he doesn't really have to worry about.  Yeah.  I think he's gay.  I think you think he's gay.  Why else?  Why?  How old is he?  And how old is she?  Why?  He's not a kid.  Well,  she's a lot older though,  man.  Someone do the math.  Ask Ben.  She's a lot older.  All right.  Ben.  Tim Robbins,  he's always skateboards.  He's tall.  There were cops parked out in front of the building.  Did you hear him gossiping about them last week?  There were cops parked out in front of Susan Sarandon, 
[00:58:30]  Tim Robbins' building.  Yeah.  Really,  Ben?  And what else did you learn?  I have my little phone in my ear.  But he always goes on to other gossip from like one piece of it.  He never has any real information.  He'll have like a couple of good lines,  and just when you get like,  you go,  really?  He'll go,  yeah,  and then he'll go on to something else you don't care about.  He's got his ear to the pavement.  He really does.  From the length of his hair,  ten cabs have run it over.  And he has his ear and the rest of his face to his pavement.  It's called being passed out.  Oh, man.  You beat me to it, dude.  You beat me to it.  Damn it.  I was right there.  That Ben has his nose to the grindstone. 
[00:59:00]  No,  that's not what he's doing.  It's a mirror.  Ben,  get up.  No,  no,  Tim Robbins.  Why is Ben chopping up that white stuff on the grindstone?  All right,  let's go to Frank NVA.  Frank in Virginia.  What's up,  Frank?  Hey,  little Jimmy.  How you doing?  Hello,  Buttercup.  I just want to tell you guys that I heard a rumor that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt actually  had a Java log in some wine when they were shooting on location. 
[00:59:30]  That's funny.  I really wanted the car crash on that one,  but he yanked it out.  That was very funny.  Good job.  I don't think it's funny at all.  Did they have a Java log in some wine?  Perhaps a mishap where the fire department was called?  Java log.  Java log.  I have no idea what that guy is referring to.  Just never be with another man and pick up a Java log.  Oh,  Java log.  Is that funny?  Yeah,  it's hilarious.  Shut up.  Was Jay actually over?  When he's back in town? 
[01:00:00]  Jay is,  yeah,  Jay's back in town.  Back in town.  No Java logs,  though?  No,  no Java logs at all.  Ooh,  the Survivor finale.  Shut up.  The men in their pajama bottoms with no tops.  You know that's how the gay guys lounge around in their PJ bottoms?  They're perfect abs.  Yeah.  All right,  let's say it.  Two men eating marmalade,  rubbing scented oils on each other's V-shaped abdomens.  Let's go to Chicago.  Hey,  Chicago,  what's up today?  Tim Robbins is 46 and Susan Sarandon is 58. 
[01:00:30]  I guess that is a little,  uh,  that's awful.  Perpetual surprise face.  I like it.  I read in the newspaper,  they called her golf balled eyed Susan Sarandon.  Did they really?  Hysterical.  Good.  How do you print that in the newspaper?  You know,  she probably has eye drops she needs because they're always wide open,  like a clockwork orange.  Just huge drying out by the second.  Yeah.  You know when you should go out with a 58 year old?  Hmm.  When you're 78.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's a chippy. 
[01:01:00]  I mean,  when did they,  but when did they start going out?  Like 15 years ago?  It was a while ago.  Maybe that made sense.  It never made sense.  Do the math.  He was 31,  let's say 15 years ago and she was 43.  Ah.  Yeah.  Wow.  She was much more famous than him 15 years ago.  Yeah.  So maybe she was a catchy,  what was he doing?  And 15 years ago for an older broad,  she was put together pretty well.  You know,  she's just hit the wall recently.  Yeah.  Look at Cher,  but then again,  Cher's still a piece of ass,  but I mean,  she's always.  She is.  She's not.  Her age.  I don't think she is.  For Cher's age,  she is still very sexy.  Cher lost me when she went through that phase 
[01:01:30]  where her face didn't move in the infomercial.  Remember that?  This is wonderful.  And her lips didn't move.  She was a ventriloquist.  And her cheeks were like puffy.  That was like where Cher really lost it.  Yeah.  She looked good in those,  you know,  old videos she was in  when she got her ass tattooed  on the battleship or something.  I liked her when she was singing on the cannon.  Here's her turn back.  God,  that song stinks. 
[01:02:00]  She had.  That awful?  Awful.  Oh,  there it is.  And then she had her son in the video  and her,  she had a wedgie  and her ass  is showing with the tattoo.  And it was awful  because if you have a flat ass,  you're not,  you shouldn't be wearing  any of those freaking T-backs ever.  And the tats were like all faded.  It looked like really bad,  silly putty,  picked up images  of the comics  in a newspaper  and then you stretch them out of shape.  That's what those tats look like.  Just big blotches.  Like an old,  like an old sailor  that used to have something on his arm 
[01:02:30]  and it's,  you can't even tell what it was.  It's just like blue ink.  She should be singing a sea shanty.  That's funny.  Tim and Susan together since 88.  88.  Look at Eric running in  with these little upsets.  Wow,  I just about nailed it.  So it was 16 years ago.  Yeah.  All right.  You want to know the bad song,  Do You Believe in Life After Love?  That is a huge song with the homos.  Is it?  Oh,  the homos love,  well,  they love Cher.  But that one,  oh,  they would shake around. 
[01:03:00]  Oh,  run for governor at Jersey.  They do crazy gay things.  Yeah,  they really do like Cher.  You don't like this one?  It's,  is this even it?  It's an abomination.  I have no idea.  Thank God.  There you go.  Oh,  this is just music  to shove your cock  through a glory hole to,  isn't it?  It is.  Music to call the fire department to.  Shut up.  Do you believe in Java logs? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  I like the vocal effects.  Yeah,  do you?  No,  not at all.  Right there.  Although I will say a song  I like very much  is Gypsies,  Tramps,  and Thieves.  I think that's a fantastic  old Cher song.  Actually,  I don't mind that song.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I don't mind that one at all.  Actually,  I think you have it in your car.  I do.  I have it.  I think we listened to that  once going down to the cellar.  I made a Napster mix.  He has the weirdest songs, 
[01:04:00]  man.  You like this one.  He was the one that turned me  on to Johnny Cash.  I knew Johnny Cash growing up,  but really didn't pay much attention  until I started driving  to comedy clubs with Norton.  I'm like,  yeah,  right on.  Now I got every Johnny Cash  song ever made.  This isn't a bad song.  Yeah,  this is really good.  This came out about the same time  that women dressed like Helen.  Early 70s.  It was the same hairstyle  as your Helen.  But your Helen  toe-tapped to this,  didn't she?  Of course she did.  Jimmy and his cape  ran around.  While Jimmy Norton  just cried alone.  Face in a pillow. 
[01:04:30]  Unliked by all.  Shame-filled face  buried in a pillow.  You liked Ozzy,  Kiss,  and this?  I didn't like this  growing up as much.  I have these weird mixtapes  I make,  like one song for everybody.  One song?  Yeah,  like whatever.  I've done that too.  Sure.  I've done that with some bad songs.  I gotta be honest,  my iPod has...  Well,  that's what iPods  are made for.  What's the most embarrassing  song on your iPod?  Be honest.  I don't know 
[01:05:00]  because none of it's  embarrassing to me.  Well,  to you.  But you don't have one song  that like,  it might be a guilty pleasure  or something that you  put on your iPod  and like,  I can't really let people  know this is on here.  Well,  you know,  I work out a lot  and...  I'll say.  But Ben will...  Shut the...  Ben will like defend me  on this  and you know what?  I have no problem  saying it.  I have Madonna,  Ray of Light.  All right,  that's an embarrassing song  to have on your iPod,  don't be...  Not really.  I hate to fill you in,  but it is.  Ray of Light is a pretty 
[01:05:30]  cool song.  It's...  There you go.  It's very poppy.  It's good.  Yeah,  but I'm saying  for a guy to have  on his iPod,  it's kind of embarrassing.  I also have Metallica  and Tool.  You don't have to sell me  just to down-fag  this break here.  You don't have to sell me.  I don't have an iPod,  but I do have a bunch  of CDs that I make  and that counts  as the same thing,  I suppose,  in my car.  Yeah,  of course.  I have...  For a technology retard  like yourself,  that is pretty good.  Burned.  My Victrola at home.  Hold on,  hold on.  Before you move on, 
[01:06:00]  Ben,  Ray of Light.  That's a great record.  And it's a cool song,  right?  That's a cool album.  It's pretty good.  Just because it's Madonna  doesn't mean every song  is going to be stupid.  Madonna has a huge  gay following  is what it is.  That's fine,  whatever.  That kind of puts  a stigma on all her music.  I have the...  What's the song?  The Island song?  I like that one a lot.  I actually...  What song is that?  Fire Island.  No, no, no.  Fire Island.  Down on Fire Island.  No, I never...  Wait, what's the one called? 
[01:06:30]  Little Island Bonita?  Oh, wait a minute.  The Madonna song?  Yeah.  La Isla Bonita or something.  Right, right.  See, now that's faggy.  I have that on my bird.  I love that song.  You play Ray of Light  next to that song.  Trust me, Ray of Light is not...  Don't talk up Ray of Light  like it's Metallica,  my friend.  Yeah.  Dude, it's a lot better than...  What is it?  I'll give you that, but...  What's the name of the song?  I'm sure...  La Isla Bonita or something.  Yeah, one of those.  Oh, my God.  I like that tune.  Dude, that is a lot worse  than Ray of Light.  It probably is.  You just saved me, man. 
[01:07:00]  Is it a lot worse?  It's a lot worse.  Eternal Flame by the Bangles  I downloaded and burned.  You got that one?  I like that one, yeah.  You know what it is?  My most embarrassing song,  I actually have Wang Chung  on my iPhone.  Yeah.  That's gay and awful.  That's what's called  a guilty pleasure.  Right.  A guilty pleasure.  This is the one...  Oh, I like this song.  Crank this up.  This is awful.  That's a good song.  This is so much worse.  Thank God you came up  with this one.  Last night,  I called up a hooker. 
[01:07:30]  She dropped a javalog  on my chest, she did.  A young girl with eyes  like a river.  Do you have fantasies  of Madonna beating you up  and kicking you down the stairs  and then cuddling you?  Yes, and then rejecting me  for a photo 25 years later  where I promote her  awful products.  Look, the Madonna tampon line.  Yeah, this song is awful.  I like this one.  No, this is a lot worse. 
[01:08:00]  Florentine one time told me  because my radio was preset  to all these awful stations,  he's like,  what's the matter with you?  If someone steals your car,  they're going to think  they stole a gay guy's car  because of my radio stations.  You do get those guilty pleasures  though that, you know,  maybe for nostalgia reasons,  you kind of listen and go,  oh, you know,  it takes you back.  Well, dude,  I have everything like,  you know, Metallica,  I have everything,  Sabbath, Ozzy, Kiss,  like all the stuff I like.  So it's like,  you just download,  Napster's great.  You just download  a little song here and there.  I'm not going to buy  the whole stupid 
[01:08:30]  Bryan Adams CD,  but I do happen to want  to hear Heaven.  You really?  Heaven?  Oh, I have that one.  All the Bryan Adams songs  you can play?  You really have a collection  of faggy songs.  I do.  I do like,  I like some of those  corny love songs.  I am so out of the barrel.  Thank God.  I need love songs.  And sometimes I do.  Heaven?  Summer of 69's a cool song.  I like this one better.  I'm not a Bryan Adams fan at all.  Oh, this was our wedding song.  Well, yeah,  it's a pretty awful wedding song.  It's a good tune.  Do you know what I got 
[01:09:00]  into this song?  You're the only one  that should not be thinking  about your younger years,  okay?  Because that's what has caused  all your problems.  Are you insane?  Thinking about the porch  we hit on your head.  You're the one  that has deep, dark secrets.  I don't think you want to be  thinking about your younger years.  Another fine Christmas moment,  by the way,  after that you don't like people  to really go doo-doo on you  question was,  we didn't know those things 
[01:09:30]  were going on.  You know,  the monster aim.  Oh, my God.  I got to now acknowledge that.  It's just awful.  To believe  we're under the porch.  Paul Bond  did a song parody of this,  which is what got me  into this song years ago.  He was doing  Butta Fuco and Amy Fisher,  and he said,  it's hard to believe  you're 11,  and that always made me laugh.  Oh, I like this.  That's funny.  Yeah, it was really  a good parody.  Oh, God.  All right.  That's a nice tune. 
[01:10:00]  I got some old,  like,  Skinnered on there,  which is cool.  Oh, yeah.  Ballad of Curtis Lowe.  Good stuff.  Yeah.  You ever hear  Am I Losing by them?  Probably.  Hard to find.  I don't remember.  I know there's other ones  on there that I would  be embarrassed of,  but I can't remember.  Well, that's not  embarrassing, though.  Got to bring it in.  Classic rock.  That's good stuff.  No, no, not that.  But, you know,  Wang Chung's a little  embarrassing to have  on your iPod.  Pops up.  Doon, doon, doon. 
[01:10:30]  Doon, doon, doon.  Doon, doon, doon.  Doon, doon, doon.  Everybody.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Across the nation,  around the wall.  Oh, dude, I have  Mexican radio.  That's a cool.  I like Mexican radio.  That's a good tune.  I have no problem  saying that one out.  That's, yeah, that's fine.  That's kind of corny.  Who's this?  Hey, buddy.  They didn't put  your name up there.  What's up? 
[01:11:00]  You.  Hello.  Yeah, you.  That just said hello.  Oh, am I on?  Yes, sir.  What's your name?  Hey, Mike, from Jersey.  Hey, Mike, let's go.  Mike, we were playing  this game at work one time  with our iPod to come up  the gayest song,  and the winner was  Right Said Fred,  I'm Too Sexy.  Who walked around  with that, a guy?  There was some dude  at work, and he's gay,  and he had it on his iPod.  What a better source  to go to.  I think we kind of,  I think we did this bit  a while ago, like,  what is the gayest song  out there?  Yeah.  Well, that was ours, so. 
[01:11:30]  You think you can come up  with a better one  than I'm Too Sexy?  That's.  That's pretty gay.  It's Rainin' Men  is pretty gay.  Oh, that's gay, yeah.  It's Rainin' Men.  That was sung by a woman, right?  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.  Monster Rainin' Men.  If it was sung by a man,  then, yeah, definitely,  but it's sung by a woman,  so it's a faggy song,  but is it the gayest song  out there?  Are we on a minute delay  in that studio?  How does he get  these songs so fast?  Dirk's really good, man.  Oh, my God.  Dirk's really good.  He's on top of the,  I'll say.  on top of things.  That's pretty bad. 
[01:12:00]  People saying  Wang Chung,  the most embarrassing  of all songs  to have on.  It's a bad song.  It's a bad song,  but I don't think  it's like the worst.  How do you,  how does somebody  Wang Chung tonight?  What does that mean?  I don't know.  You're just wanging,  chunging,  herking,  jerking.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, why don't we  take a quick break here?  All right.  A lot of good  phone calls coming in.  We'll go to the phones next.  I love Eternal Steve  by the Bangles,  people. 
[01:12:30]  I prefer Fight Steve  with Steve.  One guy did write,  these are the type of songs  that bears listen to.  We couldn't get to him.  He was on the phone.  We should see what  Steve's most embarrassing  song is.  Let's see what Steve's  most embarrassing  four CDs are.  I'm sure he has  quite a few.  I think I did have  this one on my iPod,  too.  Ant, remember the  guy singing the worst  song ever from the  80s, Saga,  On the Loose.  Remember Saga? 
[01:13:00]  That's not a bad,  I mean, it's bad,  but it's, you know.  On the Loose,  do you actually have that?  Look, he's shuffling  in there for that one.  No?  Oh, come on.  You remember this one?  I remember On the Loose,  sure.  How 80s is this song?  Jesus.  I'll tell you what  would be gay.  It would be anything  probably by Duran Duran.  Rio.  Duran Duran.  Yeah, they're most.  But those were pretty  cool songs when they  came out.  I never listened.  All right.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  We'll go to break with a  little On the Loose here.  Crank it up, everybody.  It's the Opie and  Anthony program.  I see the problems start.  I watch the tension grow.  I see you keeping it to  yourself.  And instead of reaching  conclusions, I see you  reaching for something else.  No one can stop you now.  Tonight's you're on the  loose.

[01:14:30]  and let the others  take it for a while.  When the pace is too fast,  I think I won't last.  You know where I'll be  found.  I'll be standing here  beside myself,  getting ready for the  final round.  No one can stop me now.  Tonight I'm on the  loose.  No one can tell me how. 
[01:15:00]  Tonight I'm on the  loose.  No one can stop me now.  Tonight I'm on the  loose.  No one can tell me how.  Tonight I'm on the  loose.  This is a very special  show.

[01:18:00]  list of gay songs.  Culture Club, Karma Chameleon.  Of course Village People in the  Navy.  Wham!  Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.  Go-Go.  Yeah.  That's pretty gay.  That's up there.  I have Karma Chameleon  downloaded.  I have that one.  You do.  Yeah.  It's the only Culture Club  song I have.  That's one too many.  It really is, man.  Love Shack?  That's not really good.  I love Shack.  It's all right.  It's just terrible.  Achy, breaky heart.  Awful.  That's just lame.  If you had that on your iPod. 
[01:18:30]  Kill yourself.  All right.  I have a nice version of Garth  Brooks singing Hard Luck Woman.  That's not gay.  That's fantastic.  You do, huh?  Yeah.  With Kiss.  Someone is saying, how about  Forget Me Not by Regis Philbin.  Forget Me Nods.  You sideless twine.  This is pretty funny.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, guys.  I'm not gay, but I dig Dancing Queen  from ABBA.  ABBA's one of those things that  will stick in your head forever. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  They have those haunting harmonies.  Well, Anthony, what was going on  with the floods?  Oh, I was just watching some of  the news coverage of California.  Seems to be a lot of mudslides,  a lot of rain, a lot of flooding.  People running.  Oh, there it is.  There he goes.  Oh!  Isn't that great?  We were just talking about it.  That's exactly what we were  about to mention.  Look at this.  They have to cover his honey.  They got to blur it out.  Is that the same guy?  That's the guy.  Holy S.  They keep showing this poor bastard. 
[01:19:30]  You don't want to be known as the guy  with your cock hanging out  as the rest of you know.  Was that him?  Yeah, that's him.  Look at him.  I wonder who does he remind you.  I don't want to say his name.  Dr. Bill McCree.  Who does he remind you of?  Oh.  Oh.  I'll tell you how fair.  I just realized I don't want to say it.  Oh, you should have.  Nah.  Wow.  He's there with his daughters now?  Yeah.  On TV?  How embarrassing.  He's the guy, if you watch the news,  he's stuck in a flooded river. 
[01:20:00]  And the rescue crew gives him a rope  and is pulling him up this bridge.  Now the water.  There it is again.  Here it is again.  There he is.  He's on his car and it got flooded.  That's his car in the middle of that mess?  Yep.  Look, it's in the middle of a riverbed.  How did his car get down there?  I don't know.  I don't understand how some of these cars get where they.  Did you see the other one in the ocean that they showed?  It doesn't really take much water to move a car.  And they have to blur his hiney.  They'll show bodies floating up in the tsunami, 
[01:20:30]  but you have to blur his hiney.  It's just silly.  He's on his cell phone.  Is that great?  He's on his cell phone.  He's on his cell phone.  Hello?  Yeah, I'm in a flood.  Sarah, we're in a truck.  And, yeah, the rescue crew kind of got a rope to him.  And then they're trying to pull him up onto this bridge.  And the rope snaps.  I guess the water pulled his pants off.  Yeah.  The rush of water had pulled his pants off.  And he's naked.  So his schlong is hanging out. 
[01:21:00]  They pull him up and they almost got him up to the top of this bridge.  And the rope snaps.  And his daughters are talking now.  We never knew Dad was unclipped.  Oh, come on.  Show it again.  Oh, they'll show it again.  So they're pulling him up.  The rope snaps.  And he goes ass over tea kettle and falls into this, like, raging river again.  Oh, here it comes.  Here it comes.  He's going to grab the rescue rope, right?  Look, his car is moving and everything.  He grabbed the rescue rope.  He's on top of his car.  Now his car is moving pretty quickly.  There he is with no pants. 
[01:21:30]  His schlong.  And, oh!  His schlong hanging out.  He can't hold on.  And, oh, slow motion.  Slow motion now.  God, you've got to love the noose for this crap.  And there he goes.  Oh, he let go of the rope.  What was his fatal error, man?  Why couldn't he keep holding on to the rope?  He was just about to the top.  It slipped right out of his hands.  Oh, he didn't.  The rope didn't break.  No.  No.  And then he falls maybe 20 feet, 15 feet.  Face first.  Back into the nuts first.  Yeah.  He did a mule flop. 
[01:22:00]  That would have hurt.  And then they get him later.  Oh.  How embarrassing.  How embarrassing.  You're the guy on TV with your dick out.  And you know his friends are probably all nice because he's a doctor.  They're probably like, oh, thank God you're all right.  They should tease him for the rest of his stupid life.  Of course they should.  Oh, that is hilarious.  They've been showing this clip all day.  Well, of course.  It's naked guy.  Naked guy.  Here they go pulling him up and wham, back onto his nutsack. 
[01:22:30]  He lets go.  Pulls back in cock first.  And now here's the rescue later on.  Yeah, they show him.  Now they're pulling him out of the water.  His pants completely off.  What an about.  I think I saw his yam bag all blurred out.  America's funniest whole video.  This guy's got it in the bag.  Is that show still on?  Oh, look at his ass.  His wet white ass. 
[01:23:00]  He's being raped by the water.  Yanks his trousers down.  And his kids are there watching Dad's bony ass.  Dad half naked like a woman being pulled out of the water.  It's not even like his sons are watching.  He's got two very young daughters watching his nakedness being pulled and dropped back  into the water.  But your dad is supposed to be the guy that protects you when you were a kid.  How are you supposed to look up to him now?  How are you ever supposed to listen to him when he yells at you?  The man whose trousers were yanked off by the raging waters. 
[01:23:30]  And he fell face first with his genitals hanging out.  Had to be rescued by other men.  While the water just...  Real men.  ...cascaded over his balls and taint.  Getting a power enema.  So he helplessly just screamed and begged.  Oh, that is an embarrassing piece of footage.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Think they'll show that at his birthday and stuff?  There's a real monster flood.  When company's over.  Come on, pull out the tape.  That is really funny.  All right, let's go to the phones and see what's going on today. 
[01:24:00]  Say hi to Anthony in Queens.  Anthony.  Yeah, good morning, guys.  Hello.  Good morning.  Did you guys catch the Surreal Life Sunday night?  I gotta start watching this.  Which one?  Is this when Mini-Me passes out?  Oh, that was the funniest shit.  He was naked on a scooter right around.  You know those little World War II vets?  Those little scooters they drive around.  The old guys with the Fez hats on?  Yeah.  His drunk passed out in the corner.  And he was making the funniest noises when he was passed out.  You saw it?  I actually ate dinner at Bob Kelly's house last night.  And he made me watch it.  And I really was pretty funny, man. 
[01:24:30]  Did Bob cry?  Yeah.  Did Bob get all emotional?  He's sad.  He's drunk.  Fruits him.  Oh, you gotta see some of Bob's headshots, by the way.  I have to get off the set.  Bob Kelly got some headshots done.  Right.  And a couple of them are really good.  And a couple of them, he should be drummed out of show business for.  Drummed out.  We have to universally get together.  I told Bob we should have a contest and let people pick his hat.  There are a couple of these that are mind-bogglingly awful.  Just really bad.  There's one of him, and you know Bob.  He looks like Colonel Kurtz. 
[01:25:00]  Where he's standing there with his head tilted to the right.  And he's wearing like an old 1950s sports coat.  And he's holding a fedora.  Why?  Because he's an ass.  Ha-ra-cha-cha!  That headshot stinks, stupid.  But anyway, we watched it, and Mini-Me is in it with a bunch of people.  And Mini-Me, I didn't even, it's just, it's like you see him, you just want to pick him up and hurt him.  Yeah, he's really a freak.  And he gets drunk and passes out.  And later, he gets on one of those little scooters. 
[01:25:30]  And he's standing in front of Christopher Knight, who's on the Surreal Life.  Peter Brady.  Peter Brady, yeah.  He has washboard abs, by the way.  The guy's in terrific shape.  It's really depressing.  Yeah, and he's just sitting on this scooter in front of Peter Brady's room, just urinating on the floor.  Come on.  Stop it.  Yeah.  He's like a little dog running around the house.  Yeah, he really is.  One of those rat dogs.  Did somebody stick his face in it and go, no, no, bad midget freak.  Did you see when he was full side patting his leg with his arm? 
[01:26:00]  Did you see that?  A little midget arm.  It was patting like Peter Brady's leg when he passed out.  Yeah, his little awful wrinkled hand.  Oh, that hand.  He's got one of the worst midget hands ever.  Like a little fat dog's paw.  Oh, yeah.  You just want to sink your teeth into it until he yelps.  Oh, his little platypus hand.  Disgusting.  That's the one with China, too, right?  The new Surreal Life has China?  I could be starving on an island somewhere with a midget, and if he offered me something  with that awful hand, I would just say, no, I'm not hungry. 
[01:26:30]  I would not eat anything handed to me in that thing that they call a hand.  Because they can't grip it.  Whenever it was a pretzel rod, he'd have to tape it to his hand and hold it out.  Give it to you because they can't curl their fingers around anything.  Monkeys have better dexterity because they can actually twist their hand around.  These guys are like, yeah, it's like a dog paw.  Try to get a dog to pick up change.  It's the same thing as a midget.  It's just impossible.  Those fingers stick straight out.  They're an inch long.  This huge, disgusting fingernail on it. 
[01:27:00]  Here you go.  You want to share this Hershey bar with me?  Snap.  No.  Ugh.  I'm not hungry.  You weigh 10 pounds.  You're just dying.  No, none for me.  Ooh, I'm stuffed.  You have to see this little...  He looks like a baby when he's laying there drunk and shirtless.  Oh, it's so awful.  Oh, he's horrible.  I wish I could remember the noise he was making.  He kept going...  Really?  Oh, it was awful.  Like a sleeping shih tzu with the mouth all screwed up. 
[01:27:30]  See, that's the type of thing you have to TiVo.  Bob did TiVo, but I don't know how to get it onto a thing from him.  I would love to hear the noises he made now.  Well, maybe Robert Wall, he's probably not up yet, but he has it.  He could burn it for us.  I'm sure he has it.  All right, very good.  Wow, well, I'm going to have to watch that one.  Yeah, that's the real life is, I don't know, it looks like a show that we have to check out.  Yeah.  That mini me being drunk and urinating was hilarious.  That was very funny.  All right, let's say hi to Mark in Philly.  Something's going on.  On a housebroken dog.  Just to see him so humiliated, not only for being something that should have been yanked out with a hanger after two weeks, 
[01:28:00]  but just to be urinating on the rug and not able to handle his liquor like a man.  Yeah.  He can't even drink with the boys.  No.  His little organs, just not being able to distill that booze.  His little liver just working overtime like a steam engine.  I can't do it.  A little thimble of bourbon or something just puts him over the top.  Just wants to be one of the boys once in his rotten life.  Oh, and it'll never happen. 
[01:28:30]  No, Peter Knight had to pick him up, whatever his name, Christopher Knight, had to pick him up like a baby and carry him into his room.  No, I like calling them by their TV names.  Peter Brady had to pick up maybe me.  Yeah, I called him Peter.  I put them both together.  Peter Knight.  That's like calling Mr. Brady Mike Skinny.  We've got to go to Philly.  Something might be going on in Philly today.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  I'm on Roosevelt Boulevard and Red Lion Road.  It looks like they got a live shot, but I think they just noticed me, and they're not filming yet. 
[01:29:00]  It looks like until I leave or something.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Hmm.  He was trying to do a...  They got the light on the camera, and the newswoman's just standing right there, and the cameraman and the newswoman keep on looking over.  I mean, it's a pretty empty field, so...  Yeah, he's...  It's an empty area, so I can't really hide.  This guy's trying to do an assault on the media, Anthony.  We greatly appreciate when the listeners get the Opie and Anthony and Wow signs on live TV.  Oh, absolutely.  And it looks like this attempt's going to fail, though, Mark? 
[01:29:30]  I don't know, dude.  The light's still on in the camera.  I'm not really sure what's going on yet.  They keep on looking at me, though.  All right.  Well, give us an update if something happens, okay?  All right.  I got a notebook written with Wow on it.  That's all I got, because I'm in my work truck.  All right.  Well, thank you, Mark.  No problem.  We'll see if you can get that done.  Let's go.  Chris from Brewster on Instant Feedback says, old Dr. Wetschlong there that fell off the bridge,  Channel 4 showed it unblurred this morning in Brewster, New York, I guess. 
[01:30:00]  Well, we got Channel 4 on now.  Let's hope for the best.  See if the FCC shuts them down.  Oh.  No, it's funny, because you got to think that rainwater's really, really cold.  Oh, it's coming from melting snow in the mountains.  Believe me, it's cold.  He's packing an acorn as they're rescuing him.  Bag all tight.  Little acorn, and the fireman just looking and laughing at him.  His bag's so tight, you got that ache.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Right. 
[01:30:30]  You got that ache in your lower abdomen.  You got to push down on your lower abdomen so a nut doesn't pop into your lower abdomen.  Or is it pulling you up the side of the bridge?  Your helmet is scraping against the concrete?  Getting all chafed and sore?  That's the worst part, is being nakedly pulled up by rough firemen.  Oh.  They're just worried about your life.  Right.  They're not worried about, yeah, your helmet rubbing against concrete.  Yeah.  We'll take care of that later at the hospital.  Tries to put his bony knees out in defense.  His bony white ass. 
[01:31:00]  You leave part of your penis on the side of the bridge.  Oh, brother.  Horrible.  Hey, TJ, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Apparently, Dr. Beamer lost control of the BMW on the highway, plunged the thing off a bridge overpass.  That's one of those drainage culverts in L.A. that they filmed Terminator in.  Yeah, they're all over the place.  I guarantee the guy was on his cell phone, not paying much attention at all.  And the two daughters were in the car.  I like to think of it as the little trenches that they raced in Greece. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Oh, and by the way, gayest song ever?  Relaxed by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  That's pretty gay.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Not that I have that on my iPod.  I have True by Spandau Ballet.  True.  Punch it out, Maverick.  Spandau Ballet.  Spandau Ballet.  The only thing that could be gayer than having True is after Spandau Ballet.  Spandau Ballet.  Spandau Ballet.  Spandau Ballet. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  You're fired!  I actually meant to get the crash on there.  I screwed up.  Spandau Ballet.  Spandau Ballet.  That was supposed to be polo ponies.  I was going to say the only thing gayer than that is after you do Carson Daly with Spandau Ballet  to run up to them and ask them for photos individually, which I did.  Stop it.  Love your stuff, man.  You did not.  Why would you want a picture with Spandau Ballet? 
[01:32:30]  True.  Did they keep walking and say, you could follow me?  No, of course.  They stopped happily.  Offered me their home numbers.  What are you doing for lunch, kid?  No, of course not.  Oh, that's classic.  No, they didn't have a big, stupid lower lip.  All right, well.  Staying with the mini-me thing reminded me, on the plane ride, coming back from Vegas,  you know when the movie's over, they play crappy TV?  Sure.  They play, like, Good Morning America clips and stuff like that. 
[01:33:00]  They showed some segment.  It was this kid, I guess in his teens, in a wheelchair, because he was half, he only had half his body.  Dude, this guy was strapped in a chair, a wheelchair, and he, it was from the bottom of his rib cage down,  was all there was of this guy.  And I'm watching, and they're not answering the questions everyone's asking.  What about a schlong?  How does he take a dump? 
[01:33:30]  How does he take a leak?  You mean the rib cage up is all they had?  You said the rib cage down is all they had of this guy.  Now, that would be interesting.  It's just a, how do you live without a head?  Just legs.  Just legs.  It was, yeah, the bottom of the rib cage up.  And that was all there was of this guy.  And, you know, he was born like that.  So they showed baby films of him walking up the stairs on just his hands.  It looked like a horror movie.  It looked like a horror movie.  I think that guy was on, like, Springer or something.  He got married once.  How old is he now?  I think they showed him with his, like, wife or something. 
[01:34:00]  Was he in his 30s, maybe?  No, he kind of still looked youngish.  Okay.  Maybe in his late 20s or mid-20s.  All right.  Probably the same guy.  But did he have a mullet?  I think he did.  Yeah, I think it's the same guy.  They showed him playing wheelchair basketball.  And his wheelchair got knocked over.  And he goes right on his face and tries to boost himself back up with his hands.  And it's horrific to watch.  But you're wondering how he takes care of business.  You can't have an ass.  How do you take your dumps? 
[01:34:30]  Does he have a schlong?  Does he have sex?  No questions.  They talk about how courageous he is.  Probably just some stupid hole at the bottom, like, under his ribcage.  It's probably just a hole that nature put for him to leak out his whatever business he has to leak out.  God, that blows.  Just some festering wound.  Life.  Although I kind of envy him to not have a mule.  I mean, as much pleasure as it gives me, it's my greatest obsession and the greatest source of torture.  Or to not have that.  I mean, you know, come on.  Your biggest worry is, am I going to make this two-pointer? 
[01:35:00]  Let's say hi to Sean.  Sean, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hi, Pumpkin Ball.  Hello, sweetie.  Thanks for calling.  How are you doing?  I heard at the end of the surreal life, Peter Brady kicked Mini-Me in the liver.  I don't know what that means.  Burr!  Burr!  Yeah.  You can only hope.  Chester!  Mini-Me can't be eating prime rib.  Where is Chester?  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Chester, what are you doing downstairs?  We've got to take a break.  I shared enough. 
[01:35:30]  Big boot print.  Shut up.  Magnus fur.  Sneakers.  What did you give me, Eric?  We were talking about Ray of Light, so Eric gave me some kind of mash-up.  Yeah, it's a new mash-up.  It's Madonna's Ray of Light and Sex Pistols God Save the Queen.  Hmm.  Oh, this has got to be a clusterf.  Interesting combination.  It's really big in Europe right now, but it's going to be released in the United States soon.  Oh, Europe.  Eric is the mash-up expert.  It's really big in Europe. 
[01:36:00]  So is the Jew punching.  Europe stinks.  All right, there's skirmies.  Listen, listen.  And now, here's Jenny.  All right.  Just stop listening.  I'll spin it.  I'll turn it on me.  It's my hand.  There's a little sky at night, I won't do it. 
[01:36:30]  Do my tears in the morning, sing for you in my soul.  She's got a simple, you know, first go through you, through you.  For the color, the manga, protein until you're gone.  And I feel like this disco fell in the hill.  And I feel like this disco fell in the hill. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, i'm so relatively lazy.  She's flying  Trying to get  Remembered  Back again  Sky is never  Nails and faceless  Heavens  Leading for the  Lying man  Nursery and  Dawn  And I feel

[01:45:00]  Where was that again?  The high school kids  Doing the  The teens doing freak dancing  Freak dancing  What the hell is freak dancing?  That's what I said  I read the  I was reading in the paper  Some school  Is supposed to have a dance  And they  Canceled the dance  Because the kids  They're freak dancing  And I'm like  What the hell is this?  And then I'm seeing  A bunch of schools are doing this  They're kind of canceling a lot of dances  And parents are outraged 
[01:45:30]  Because their kids are freak dancing  There you go  What is freak dancing?  It's  It's suggestive dancing  You ever see  You ever see when  Like chicks at clubs  Bend over  And guys just get right behind them  And start humping their asses  And grabbing like their hair  Isn't it like a form of dirty dancing?  Yeah  It's like the new dirty dancing  Not the old dirty dancing  Like Patrick Swayze  Dirty dancing 
[01:46:00]  Which isn't really dirty dancing  Is it?  This is the new and improved  Dirty dancing  This is filthy dancing  And it's kids  They said  Like from 12 years old  12 up to you know  17, 18 years old  That are doing this  Some of the other moves  Are grabbing the girl  By the sides of her head  By her hair  And shoving her face  Into your crotch  And then gyrating  And she would then  Be bent over  And another guy  Could come up behind her  And start humping her ass 
[01:46:30]  And this is dancing  That's a little move  Called the lucky girl  Put her on the old rotisserie  Right on the spit  And parents are outraged  Principals  Are stopping dances  And the teens are saying  This is just the way  They express themselves  They say that  That their parents  And their parents before them  Went through the same thing  With their suggestive type dances  You know  Elvis himself  Had to be edited 
[01:47:00]  Because of his gyrations  His shaking hips  Yeah  But it's a lot different  That's a lot different  Simulating like head  A 12 year old  Bending over  Getting dry humped  By another 12 year old  It kind of  You know  It's kind of different  The parents are kind of right  On this one  You know  I hate to be in that  Whole thing  It's just a little  Too sexy to think about  You don't want to be  The guy that goes  Yeah you know  You can't have that 
[01:47:30]  Going on  But you can see  Why the parents  Would be kind of  Pissed off at this  You go to  Picture your  Little girl dancing  You want to  Picture her in a  Ball gown  Doing some kind  Of ballroom dancing  Some nice slow dancing  Not having balls  Slapping against their ass  As she's dancing  Well the older people  Are doing that dance  Where they kind of  Grab a rope  And their pants  Are pulled down  And they get  Knocked into the water  And they continue on  And then their helmets  Are scraped up  It's called  Do the humiliation  You need a couple 
[01:48:00]  Of firemen there  To do it  Sure  How do you downplay  The fact that  Your penis  Was rubbing up  Against the bridge  As you're getting  A cement culvert  Just your schlong  Rubbing there  Why were you nude  While the water  Had pulled my trousers down  Yeah  With such a torrent of water  Some of your penis  Is left behind  For flies to nibble on  Oh  That filthy water 
[01:48:30]  Just rushing into  Your open wounds  On your schlong now  Well you know  That it probably  When the  Yanked the pants down  It had to hurt  A little bit  I mean I'm sure  That wasn't a gentle  Unzip  No  You would think  It would hurt  Bring it down  It just must have  Been the worst  When he was just  Almost up to that bridge  Because you know  The firemen  Are probably going  Alright give me your  Oh there he goes  We lost  Oh we had him  He's probably thinking  Hey I'm out of this  This is great  It's a little embarrassing 
[01:49:00]  My pants are off  But  Face first  Maybe let go of the rope  To cover up his junk  Oh  The last thing the firemen  So is his white ass  Falling into the water  Skinny doctor legs  Yam bag  Slapping that water  So that's just  A great piece of video  Alright so the freak dancing  Is going on  And  Yeah  Pretty much no one  Gives a crap  Right  Well the parents  Give a crap  And the principals  But I don't know  Kids are I guess  Going to keep doing it  I've seen  We saw that done in 
[01:49:30]  The first time I even saw it  Was during Freak Nick  Remember that  In Atlanta  Oh my god  I remember Freak Nick  Remember Freak Nick  Back in Atlanta  Yeah they flew us down  To Atlanta  For a job interview  After we got fired  From Boston  For saying the mayor  Of Boston  Died in a fiery car accident  Yeah  So yeah  Your pals almost worked  In Atlanta  Yeah  Close  Because Pat Irvin  Pat Irvin said  It's just like New York  It's just like New York 
[01:50:00]  Atlanta's just like New York  You'll be so surprised  At how many displaced  New Yorkers  Are down here  He's telling us  In the middle of  Dart night  In a country bar  Yeah  Where everyone had  Cowboy hats on  And they were  You know  They were throwing darts  Nothing against that  I don't really care  But if you're trying  To tell us  It's just like New York  And this is what  Oh no  Did I say I don't care  Yeah I don't care  I don't care  I don't care  But if you're trying  To tell us  You know 
[01:50:30]  It's just like New York  As we're listening  To Garth Brooks  And people play darts  Yeah  Sorry  Sorry that  We're not really  Going to believe you  You get yourself  A house out there  In Buckhead  And you drive  In Atlanta  Do the show  It's just like New York  And you get a lot  For your money  Down here  Oh a dollar  Goes a lot further  Than it does up there  In New York City  Oh stop it  We're not moving  Down here  Thank God  New York wanted us  As well  Thank God  Because we would have 
[01:51:00]  Had no choice  Yeah  We would have  Lived in Atlanta  Atlanta  No  So anyway  Why Atlanta  Oh Freak Nick  Yeah they flew us  Down there  And Freak Nick  Was going on  Now this is  Spring break  For black people  Better known as  I was going to say  Better known as  Whitey get out  Whitey leave  Whitey leave  Spring break  Without that pesky  College to go back to  They converge  On Atlanta  And the shopkeepers

[01:52:00]  You know  On the highway  When there's some  Kind of accident  Yeah  Up ahead  But it wasn't an accident  What was it  No no  It was  Some young black people  Dancing  On their cars  In the middle of the highway  Stopped  In the middle of the highway  So the cars are stopped  There's music  Just blasting out of these vehicles  Out of like  They got like  Super systems in these things  They're on the hood of the car  Remember the couple  That was on the hood of the car  Yeah  On the hood  The guy was basically 
[01:52:30]  Mating with this chick  On the hood of his car  This one black chick  I remember this  Like it sticks in my head  She had this big old ass  I like big  Big ass  She's  Bent over  With her hands  On her knees  And she's sticking her ass out  She's looking over her shoulder  With that  Mmm  Mmm  Face on  Mmm  And she's biting her lower lip  You know  Mmm  With her head turned around  And this  This  Huge gentleman 
[01:53:00]  Is behind her  With both hands on her ass cheeks  Just pumping away  Through the pants  They're dancing  Yeah  Yeah  They're  They're  Freak dancing  Opie  You move  Just like that  And you know what Whitey does  Just like that  You sit in your car  Just like that  You roll your windows up  You lock your doors  And you shut up  You shut up  You don't beep your horn  You don't yell 
[01:53:30]  Why don't you move over  To the side of the road  Unless you want  You know  The Reginald Denny  Potted plant brick  To the head thing  Cause when it comes down to it  Us white people  Are scared  S-less of black people  Black people  Hello black people  We are petrified of you  We are petrified of you  In certain neighborhoods  You can do anything  Try that in Bensonhurst  I'm sure somebody  Will be honking at you  Yeah  Someone will honk  Hey you mooly  Yeah  Get out of the way  Get the fuck off the road  You're so belligerent 
[01:54:00]  Hey what's the matter with you  Huh  Get the fuck off the road  You heard me  Yeah where's  Down there  During Freaknik  Yeah Anthony  Where was your road rage  That day  I've seen you road rage  Like nobody's business  I saw  Coming in from Long Island  I figured  Why would I be  In a rush  Or why would I get angry  When I can enjoy  Another culture  And sit and watch  I believe your quote was  This is a  This is a catchy song  That's what I said  Start snapping along 
[01:54:30]  To it a little bit  That's what I said  I said something like  Wow  That's your figures  And I said something like  Oh my god  I wish this road  Was bigger  Because then we could  Drive around  I think it was  Something like that  I think you also said  No wonder they don't  Have jobs  No I don't think  I said that at all  No  Huh  Ding ding  No  Alright help me out  Thank you  I think I said  My favorite poo character 
[01:55:00]  Is Tigger  Yeah  That's what I said  Or maybe I wish  I had a bunch of  Pinky triggers  Right yeah  Things like that  I was saying  I was saying something  Like that  Yeah  It was something  Like that  I think  Think about it  Really  Yeah I mean  You know something  The nicest guy  In the world  Can just turn into  A stark  Raving  Racist  Lunatic  In that  In that situation  How long were you  Sitting there for  It was quite a long time  Until the cops come 
[01:55:30]  And tell them to move  Let's just put it this way  Bernie gets  Would have had a field day  Oh forget about it  I had something like that  Happen one time  It was scary  I think it was  A great adventure  I don't remember exactly  Great adventure  Is a great adventure  These days  Oh my god  Jump on the hood  Of the car  That is  Are you talking about  The safari drive  And a great adventure  Six flags  It's just an adventure  To get back to your car  Six flags  Great adventure  In Jersey  Wow  You talk about  Some line cutting 
[01:56:00]  Going on  And just mob mentality  You want to go there  As a nice little  White family  Expect to spend  Twice the amount  Of time on lines  Than the black people  Because they will  Just walk  Right in front of you  And give you a look  Like don't even  Don't even question  Why I'm doing this  And you know something  You don't  You don't  You'll just sit there  And go  I've never seen  A bigger roller coaster  Nothing bigger  Than this roller coaster  Or something like that 
[01:56:30]  Get out the way  Get out the way  That's what they say  That's what they say  And you get out the way  Get out the way  Get out the way  Bitch  Get out the way  Move  Whitey  Get out the way  And it's so hard  In those situations  To not have racial epithets  Just race through your mind  Shouldn't it be  Get out of the way  No it's get out the way  It's quicker that way  Get out the way  They have that  What do they call that  At the amusement parks  Where you can get online  You usually have to  Pick something up 
[01:57:00]  A card  Or a key or something  It's like a speed pass thing  For the lines  Yeah  And then you ever  You hear this  And then you come back  At a certain time  Oh yeah yeah  And you get on the ride  You kind of have a reservation  Yeah  They all have that  Only they don't need a card  They don't have to visit anything  They don't have to do  But they all have  They just  It's a speed pass  Well they got  What's called a gat  Yeah  That they kind of just show  You know something  It's nothing but intimidation  And when you walk in  A great adventure  When I was a kid  And used to go there  It was nothing like this 
[01:57:30]  You walk in now  It's like you're visiting Rikers  There are metal detectors  You have to walk through  Security line  A pat down  I haven't been there  Since I was 12 I think  When was the last time  You were there recently  Like recently yeah  Why  It's a friend's birthday party  He wanted to ride some rides  Go there  And I just sat there like  Oh my god  Am I gonna make it through this  Am I really gonna survive through this  I've never seen a drive-by  On a roller coaster  Until I went there  It's fascinating 
[01:58:00]  They come down  Or a log flume  You see the splash of water  You see the bullets fly  You see some brothers fall  Yeah  The photo  The police tape goes up  Yeah  The photo of them  With their guns in the air  Like they don't care  Like they just don't care  Exactly  You can buy those photos  Bill from Jersey  What's up?  Mug shots  They take photos  It's funny  When you go on a roller coaster  And you have your photo taken  Yeah  A great adventure  It's one from the front  And one from the side  And they're holding numbers underneath  Go ahead Bill 
[01:58:30]  Morning Fuzzy Love Tits  How are ya?  I'm good baby  Thanks for calling  Down in Asbury  They have the Greek fest  Yeah yeah right  The black fraternities  But the local law enforcement  Refers it as  Chocolate sundae  For the natives  Chocolate sundae  That is so awful  Oh is that inappropriate  Here we go  Boston wants in  Yes Boston  Oh my god Boston  Go ahead Pat  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  Hi Angel 
[01:59:00]  Hi Pat  What's up  From the city of racial sensitivity  Boston Massachusetts  Pat what do you got  Even in  Western Mass  Six Flags  The only thing that's empty  Is the water park  But um  See this is Boston  The only thing that's empty  Is the water park  Cause they can't swim  Those people  But uh  Down in Daytona  They have a thing called  Black College Reunion  Where they uh  They shut down A1A  Like you said  They board up the walls 
[01:59:30]  And uh  It's just uh  Chaos for a little bit  It is  It's just whitey  Intimidation  It's  We get so intimidated  F in Boston  It's very uh  It's very hard to enjoy yourself  In those uh  Situations  Boston never disappoints  Yeah  The only pot is empty  In the water parks  Of course  God damn Boston  Never disappoints  Never  Rev from Whackbag  Yes  Hey what's going on guys  Hey  Yeah I used to go to  Action Park in Vernon 
[02:00:00]  They used to bathe them  In the wave pool  All right  Shut up  It was the worst thing ever  Enough  He does bring up a good point  But there is  Action Park  I'm sorry  We used to call it  Traction Park  Yeah  It was the most dangerous  Amusement park  Ever conceived  Ever ever ever  You go to most parks  And it's very uh  In control  You know  You  The guests are not in control  Of the attraction  You get on the roller coaster  You go  You get done  You get off  Action Park  Was some guy's idea  Of let the people 
[02:00:30]  Control a lot of this stuff  They had something called  The Alpine Slide  Where it was uh  You go up on a ski lift  And it was what amounted  To like a half pipe  Of a sewer pipe  You know  A regular round sewer pipe  Sure  They'd cut these in half  And lay them down  The side of this mountain  You'd then sit on this  Oversized skateboard  With a handbrake  Right in your crotch  And you push forward  And it would lift up  These little Teflon brakes  On the bottom  And you were on wheels  In this pipe  And you'd go down this thing 
[02:01:00]  To see people fall off  And get like  It  Just these big  Hamburger  Burn marks  On their body  Uh  They had these cars  These race cars  That weren't on a track  That you'd drive around  And  People would crash  And flip these things over  They'd have the water rides  And the wave pool  Where  Who's  Who's guarding the people  Some  Numb skull  Jersey  Asswipe  That's taking the summer off  Is uh  Sitting around  From his lifeguard 
[02:01:30]  They had more lawsuits  And more people  Get killed  And wounded  At this place  That they had to  Finally just shut it down  It was great to go to  But again  There was a lot of  Intimidation  Uh  When  When you used to go there  Very scary  Classic  The phones have exploded  Let's say hi to Jeff  Jeff what's up  Go ahead Jeff  Oh you're on the air  Sir  Jeff  Alright  We can't wait around  Today  Ellis from Philly  What's up  Hey uh  In Philly  We have the 
[02:02:00]  Greek picnic  Appropriate located  Right across the street  From the Philadelphia  Zoo's primary area  Alright  Oh stop it  Let's move on  You know something  You try to cover a subject  On this program  And the listeners  Will take it to the  Umpteenth level  That it was never  Intended to go  Let's go to Birmingham  Oh Birmingham  Alabama  That should be very sensitive  Yes Pat  New Yorkers  Stuck here in Birmingham  But if you're a white family  What you need to do  Is you need to go  When it first opens up  At 10  And you need to leave 
[02:02:30]  By like 12  1 o'clock in the afternoon  Why by 12 or 1  It's very dark  At like 12 o'clock  At 1 o'clock in the afternoon  There you go  There's Birmingham  From the city of  Fire hoses in the streets  Birmingham, Alabama  Another area  That never disappoints  Yes Jimmy  Nothing  Okay  Pete from Jersey  Hey what's going on guys  Hi Pete  I worked at Action Park  For about five years  I grew up in northern New Jersey  We had a line  Well not the Shulky line  But they even had a speech 
[02:03:00]  It told people who can't swim  Don't go towards the deep end  But the black people did  And they couldn't swim  We used to call them  African rockfish  Because they were always  Swimming at the bottom of the pool  African rockfish  Are you kidding me  I kid you not  That alpine slide  Was made out of concrete  That's why you got  All that hamburger  Because I've done that myself  Yeah that was a frightening ride  You know something  I do remember  A lot of the water tragedies  That happened there  Were the black guys  They'd go into the deep end  And for some reason  That stereotype 
[02:03:30]  But the swimming stereotype  Would just hold up  And they'd have to  Get the lifeguards in there  We hung with Earl this summer  And Earl didn't know how to swim  Oh Earl definitely not  Busting apart that stereotype  Not at all  He doesn't  Petrified of the water  Not only that  He wears dress shoes  To the beach  Yeah  With black socks  Go figure  Black shoes  Black socks  On the beach  We were walking on a dock  We were tooling around  In Ben's boat  And we had a  You know  It was a dock  That was no more  Than four feet  Wide  Maybe even less 
[02:04:00]  Three feet  He was petrified  That he was going to fall in  As he's walking on the dock  With his stupid  Black dress shoes  And black socks  And then gets mad at us  Because we're laughing at him  Because he doesn't have  Beach attire  He would drown  Mark what's up  Hey what's up guys  Hey  Hey beefsit  Hi Mark  Hey listen  I was at Six Flags  Great Adventure  And that place is atrocious  One of the roller coasters  We were on  Broke down  A little bit  After the  Loading platform 
[02:04:30]  Yeah  So we were on there  For about 25 minutes  Before it started moving  And then they said  Alright  The ride will be moving shortly  Well this black girl goes  Oh no it ain't  I want off this ride  Right now  And they're like  Man we can't let you  Off the ride  We can't reverse it  It has to go through  Before it comes  She's like  Oh no  I want off this ride  Right now  You guys are racist  They were arguing with her  For about a half hour  Finally they had to get  A crane  A special crane  Just to get her off the ride  Really  Yep  I find that hard to believe sir 
[02:05:00]  Thank you  Did he just go damn  I think he was lying  Yeah  He was pissed off  At his appearance  He's like  Oh man they didn't buy it  Damn  It doesn't matter  It's fine  Alright why don't we take a break  And the best place is  Coney Island  When was the last time  You were at Coney Island  Two weeks  Two weeks ago  You went to Coney Island  I hear they're cleaning up  Coney Island  Uh  No  Uh  No  What's the problem  Astro Land  Astro Land

Yeah  It's true, man  I'm telling you  What were they saying?  They were saying that  They were saying that  Jimmy had told them  That they spent over  That Jimmy spent over  $60,000 on whores  And they couldn't believe it  And  I never said  Hold on  I never said over $60,000 
[02:13:00]  No  Well  That's what they were saying  But they were saying  They were just saying  That you guys were  That you guys were trashing them  But they couldn't say  They couldn't really say anything bad  Because they're with XM Radio also  So  Nah, dude  I think you got it wrong  Yeah, we didn't trash them  We were nice to them  We had a really good time  Yeah  And off mic  They said they really enjoyed  Their appearance  That's not what they said  Maybe some other guys  Can call in  Because I didn't have  Playboy Radio

[02:14:00]  I've seen them before  Oh, yeah  Hello  How you doing, man?  Good  What's up?  We're not on the air, are we?  Yeah  Oh, we're completely on the air  We're completely on the air?  Very informal  Opie's eating  That's what we do  Just hanging out  Reading the paper  The simple intelligence test  Of these headphones  Has baffled me  Oh, there you go  No  Tell you what  I think it's got to go down  Yeah  That way  Like you said, I didn't sleep  I'm listening to you guys  Talk about  Listening to you guys  Talk about roller coasters  Yeah  And last night I saw a special on it 
[02:14:30]  Apparently there's been a renaissance  In roller coasters  Because of  Molybium steel  And computers  And they showed one of the Atlantic  In Kansas City  Yeah  They were 93 miles an hour  The first hill had snow on it  I mean, a monster  And no car  You're hung from your armpits  You could actually get hit in the forehead  By your own nuts  And then have the unique opportunity  To scream up your own ass  You get like an echo there  Oh, oh, oh  It was amazing  Well, I stayed up around the clock  Watching science shows  You know  Yeah  I watched everything on Earthfuck 
[02:15:00]  And then I watched roller coasters  And I learned a lot  I did  Snakes have two dicks  I didn't know that  Really?  Can you imagine God  In the primordial state  Making the snake's initial office  All right, look  No arms or legs  Two dicks  Anybody want it?  And somebody did  And God was moving  And said  I'll give you a forked tongue too  What the hell  Are you going to do  With two dicks?  Well, there's a reason  That was my first thought  Sure  Well, if you lose  The first one  Getting, you know  Rescued  Getting rescued  By some firemen  Out of a culvert  Just go to your second one 
[02:15:30]  That's why they do it  Because 70% of the time  When they mate  The female  Takes a doggy back home  She takes it  One with her  She takes it  That's right  So that's why God  Gave him two  You know  You don't get two dicks  For nothing  You pay dues  You know  You pay like heavy dues  You know  And I learned that  No matter how much  You might bitch  About getting laid  Thank God  You're not a bed bug  A female bed bug  Has no sexual opening  Really?  Really 
[02:16:00]  The male  Must drill his own  Ah, she's got a mouth  Though, right?  Drill his own  Yeah, I know  But eventually  You want to go regular  Make little bed bugs  So you've got to  Take her to the rec room  And show her to Block and Decker  Drill her  I kind of like that  Wow, it's an insectile thing  You know  It's a very insectile thing  And I learned that  Gorillas  This was on a learning channel  Yeah  The Great Mountain Gorilla  Which is known as  The symbol of sexual virility  In Japan and America  Basically because  They weigh a hundred pounds 
[02:16:30]  They rip your fucking head off  And no fear  You shoot a gun up  They laugh  Like the counter-mountain crystal  Gun, fuck you  And they rip your head off  And because of the fearlessness  And the size  They're known as sexually  Symbolic creatures  Of great strength and virility  No  According to the learning channel  The mountain gorilla  At full maturity  Has a penis  An inch and a half long  Really?  Yeah  But don't say that to the gorilla  Don't go really to the gorilla 
[02:17:00]  Because you rip your fucking head off  Alright  Sure  But five and a half inches across  Like a muffin that fucks  I don't even think  They go in and out  I think they go round and round  They got a round and round thing going  You know  Five and a half across  Yes  But three and a half  Yeah  Some guy went to college  To measure that god damn  True  What'd you do Bill  I measured the gorilla dick today  See the wound  And the next thing you know  It's dancing on a car in Atlanta  You got that right  Hey you stay at 24 hours  You watch anything 
[02:17:30]  Yeah  Watching you guys was weird  Because I'm sitting on the outside  There's a slight delay  Yeah  I'm watching a 1950s Japanese movie  You have no idea  What we're talking about  Until five minutes later  How are you?  Yeah  Very strange  Very time warpy  Well you seem like you watch  A lot of those educational programs  What are you going to do  In the wheel  Nothing  It's either that  Or softcore porn  Watch Richard Pryor tapes  Yeah  Or softcore porn  Yeah  Which is what's on  Richard Pryor tapes  Jim knows it's funny  Yeah well you know  It's about the end  Let's go to Oklahoma really fast

[02:18:30]  And the girls seemed to think  That y'all were intimidated by them  No  Yeah  We had a good time with them  They did say that  They had a good time with y'all  But they also said that  Y'all were trashing  All the porn stars  And then y'all had to interview them  And so they kind of thought  Y'all were intimidated by them  Wait we interviewed them  Before we interviewed any porn stars  Yeah  I know  But they said that y'all were intimidated  Because y'all were saying  That all porn stars were hoes and sluts 
[02:19:00]  And  Well porn stars are hoes and sluts  That's their job  What the  Yeah I know  Yeah these porn stars  Are taking their jobs  A little too seriously  Wait you gotta give the Playboy girl  Let's give them the benefit  They may have said that being funny  And then they were kind of scared  They may have said that  Just kind of off the cuff  Being silly  Maybe  And people are taking it  Literally reading from a transcript  So why don't we hear the audio  And then say horrible things  All right  All right  You'd be embarrassed about it  Thank you Jern  I'm a chap  All right  You know something  And I know us  On this program  We kind of hope they are

[02:22:00]  Sick fuck  What's up  Hello  I'm sorry boss  Can't hear you  What's going on  There we go  I'm trying to roll  I'm trying to roll a blunt  On the way to work  Alright  I got audio for you  Let me cue it up right now  Cue it up in your car  How do you cue up audio in your car  It's hard to roll in an ambulance  My fi baby  The beauty of my fi  Oh  Oh wow  Hey  There you go  And it was fun  But they did get into hurting him 
[02:22:30]  The first thing they did  Is go to a phone call  They said that he hit  That's how they tried to get us  Was by the first caller  Out of the box  Was  Grey boys  Suck  You guys suck  I like such a story  But you guys give it bad advice  And blah blah blah  Oh it's probably a friend of theirs  Alright  You know what actually does  We're sticking to a caller of ours  That sounded like  I know but he loves it  So he would  Yeah  I think it makes sense  Yeah  No  I thought it was a set up  Oh absolutely  I know you guys want  Exactly  That was the way  They were trying to start  To get us  You know  And we were like  Hey 
[02:23:00]  And yeah  Whatever  We did suck for a living  Yeah  That's the point  That's the point  And still do it nightly  With my husband  That's hard to understand right  I know what's going on  I'll explain  You're married  And you suck dick  I do  Beautiful  I do  I do  Nightly  That's pushing it  Right  Three to four times a week  That's pretty impressive  Really impressive  Is it  Yeah  Yeah  From a married standpoint  Yeah  I'd say that's impressive  Oh  Yeah  Yeah  Well  Three and a half years into it 
[02:23:30]  See  Mm-hmm  There's a little  So  See  I suck  I'm proud of it  You suck  Sorry  It's really hard to hear  Dude  Open Anthony came  And did their show  Saturday morning  Over where we were  At the laundry list booth  And  How was that?  Well I only saved  I had to go meet  Some other people  Back somewhere else  With the playboy executive  Jesus  Dirty deals there  I think Juan  Stayed for most of their show  I think  What do you think Juan?  How did they  At least more than I did 
[02:24:00]  How did they do?  Well  I never listened to much of it  But  They never  They never  Even acknowledged  That I was there  Never said hello  Never said nothing  I might as well  Not have been there  Who's this guy?  Who is he?  That's their engineer Juan  They're just like sitting there  Like didn't even like  Make eye contact  So they went to the porn  I have no clue who you were  You dick bag fuck ass  Should I pause it  So you can talk a little?  Yeah  Pause it for a second 
[02:24:30]  Because now we got to unload  All right  The girls are fine  Who is it?  Well the girls are saying  That you set them up  With that phone call  Which was not a set up  Yeah  They said that  Remember the first call  That was taken  It was almost like  The first call  We just took with Chris  Yeah you don't know  Someone called  And wanted to talk  To the Playboy girls  And basically say  They give out bad advice  They gave bad advice  But it was obvious  The guy was a lunatic  And that's where the fun was  We weren't trying to set them up  A set up  We sided with you  We gave you like  A softball 
[02:25:00]  We lobbed it in for you girls  To hit out of the park  Is what we did  And they thought it was a set up  Well that's them  You know  Being  I don't know  Paranoid  Whatever  Well it's either that  Or deal with the unpleasantness  That somebody called  To say they suck  Sorry you did  More so  Is  Who was that guy  He's the engineer  Did we meet him  Did we meet this engineer guy  Oh  Am I supposed to know  Every engineer  From XM's face  So that when we see him  We could  Give him the attention 
[02:25:30]  That he needs  I met him  I met him  And I spoke to him  A few times  He said that  We wouldn't look at him  Oh we wouldn't look  They wouldn't look at me  They didn't acknowledge me  Oh we had a  We had a show to do  You fucking idiot  I didn't even know  He existed  What a shithead  What a complete jerk  Everyone thinks  You're so important  I mean not that it wasn't  A great set up  You gave us  A round table  In the middle of the floor  You douches  Yeah  Who is this guy  Did we even see him  Yeah he was there  He was there  I spoke to him  He was nice enough to me  Was he working  Side by side with Jaime  Yeah he was directly 
[02:26:00]  Next to Jaime  The whole time  And we didn't give him  The attention  That he so needed  From us  I had no  I have no idea  Who this guy is  I have no clue  I was looking at Jaime  He's sitting there  For accusing stuff  Thinking  In his stupid head  He's actually thinking  That we did something  On purpose  That we were so  Thinking of him  That we  On purpose  Didn't acknowledge him  It's people like that  Keep a freezer full of  Pizza delivery boys  You know  Have an internal world  An internal world  That's exaggerated 
[02:26:30]  And intense  It's self important  Guys this audio started  I forgot to record  The first minute  They basically were saying  That you guys were nervous  That they were coming on  Because you bad mouthed them  For an hour  Before they got on  What?  Why?  What?  That's what I said  When I heard it  That's why I pressed  The record button  But it was a little too late  For the first minute  But there's a little more  About Jimmy coming up  All right  Let's listen in  A little more  They have all the regular  People coming through  You know  Saying hi 
[02:27:00]  But I couldn't really  Hear the show  And yeah  I mean  I was just hired  To set up the equipment  Because they were using our gear  They had their own engineer  From XM  Who was a cool guy  And he was doing CES  So he actually engineered  The show for them  And so I just  Found it around  Now they're the same guys  But at the end of their show  They run around  To all the different booths  Say oh  This isn't for me  But a friend of mine  Loves you  And wants your signature  And then they're the same guys  Like you know  They're like oh  You're a slut  You know  You have sex for money  And then 
[02:27:30]  They're the same guys  That like try to go out  And get laid at a club  On a Saturday night  Right exactly  What kind of girl  Do you think is going to be  Well they  There's a third guy  In their show  Who I don't know  The same  Has a reputation  For doing a lot of that  And if he doesn't get it  He'll pay for it  He tells us about it on the air  Yeah he's very open  About that  Yeah  Yeah  I heard him say  On the air one day  He pays about  $60,000 a year  In prostitution  And so proud  I'll pause that  For a second  Go ahead  Well sorry  I have to pay  And to Julie Ashton 
[02:28:00]  If it wasn't  People paying for fucking  You wouldn't have  Made a living stupid  You took it in the ass  In deep throat  That was your job  You had to say that  On your tax returns  Job description  What do you do  For a living  I put my face  In a pillow  While a stranger  Treats my ass  Like an oil well  Yeah I am open about it  I have to pay  Of course I do  It's really too bad  We really had a good time  We liked them a lot  And the engineer  Is just talking out of his ass 
[02:28:30]  First of all  The engineer is talking out of his ass  And they're talking like  That after the show  We were going up to what  Them  And getting autographs  And taking pictures  I didn't even  I didn't take a picture  With them  I said thanks for coming  I said thanks for doing the show  We had a good time  That was it  No pictures  Nothing  What are they talking about  I think they met  All the porn stars  In the convention  Yeah but I'm open about that  Opie and Anthony left  Dude  They didn't talk to  Any porn stars  And they goofed on them  But you know what  They had people on  They joked about it  And they treated them  Actually pretty nice 
[02:29:00]  So what they goofed on them  It's a comedy show  And they're porn stars  And we left within minutes  Of the end of the broadcast  And Jimmy we know  You love this  Me and Steve ran around  Steve of course  And I'll be the first one  To tell you I run around  And I don't make it up  To spend 60 grand  On prostitutes  I certainly would  If I made more money  I spent a lot on hookers  But not that kind of money  Yeah I'm open about it  Sorry nobody ever paid me  To pull my pants down  And get fucked in the ass  In 1974  Sorry  The engineer is stirring shit up  And the girls aren't even 
[02:29:30]  Trying to deny it  Or say you know  Hey we had a good time  On the show  And the nerve of these two  This is what annoys me  They think that they were  Just two sassy gals  That we couldn't handle  You dumb bitches  If we wanted to get you  We would have gotten you  We were nice to you  Because we liked you  Yeah  Well yeah  I mean it turned out  Yeah we liked them  But the reason they even  Came on our show  Is because they need help  With their channel  And Kevin's like  You know it would be  A nice help for the  Playboy channel  Which is dying a slow death  I mean there's only two  They just fucked themselves  There's only two premium channels  On XM right now  It's us and Playboy 
[02:30:00]  And we have  At least twice to three times  The audience they have  And they're losing listeners  Every day  So Kevin's like  Could you do me a favor  Get these girls on  They're pretty good  And they could use  A little bump  I'm like yeah  No problem  We had fun  It's too bad  That they turned it  Into this  Because I don't know  We didn't get this feeling  When we were talking to them  No  And there's no  If there's one thing  You should learn  About this awful show  Is people here  Will be made to feel  Uncomfortable  If there's something  Real going on  And the reason  Everybody here  Was nice to them 
[02:30:30]  Is because we genuinely  Like them  They were fine  He spoke highly  About them  When we got off the air  Like oh those girls  Were great  We should do something  Else with them  Holy shit  Is that aggravating  I said to Kevin  I wouldn't mind  Getting them on the show  On a regular basis  They were fun  Because we didn't  Pull our hogs out  And slap them in the face  With it  We were intimidated  Nobody  Was intimidated  You're not these two  Saucy gals  That really came in  And laid it down  Ladies  Nobody gives a fuck  You're a semi-attractive  Lingerie model  And the other one  Took dicks  Until the Susan Sarandon  Wrinkles started to show up  Sorry we were too intimidated 
[02:31:00]  By you lovely chicks  Where's this coming from  Didn't we see them  After when we came back  And they were real nice to us  Go listen to the interview  I mean it speaks for itself  We weren't intimidated  We had a lot of fun  And that first call  Was not a set up  No it wasn't a set up  You try to make  Interesting radio  Someone's calling in  Saying the girls  Don't give great advice  You're like well  If the girls are doing radio  They can handle themselves  Let's see where this leads  And it turned out  The guy made a complete fool  Of himself  During that phone call  And we backed them up  We backed them up  What kind of advice 
[02:31:30]  Do they give  Like use your left hand  That feels like  Somebody else is doing it  I mean these are girls  We jerk off to  I'm losing touch  With reality  You're talking about  Porno stars  And playboy people  Who basically  People jerk off to  Right  And they have this  Incredible sensitivity level  Wow  Makes you wonder  About physicists and nurses  The advice  That they didn't  That the guy didn't like  Was  What was it  The ass shaving  It was asshole shaving 
[02:32:00]  He called up and said  They gave bad advice  On shaving an asshole  Wow  Yeah  What  So  Alright  They drive you out of the village  If you were an expert on that  Yeah  But just the fact that they thought  That anyone was intimidated by them  Or we were nice to them  Because  You don't want to get on her bad side  She's quite a pip  Nobody gave a shit  It was genuine  We were nice  Because we thought  They were nice  And we talked about them  Off the air  When they weren't around  And spoke highly of them  Is there any more audio sir  Yeah  There's about 20 seconds  You're going to get annoyed at 
[02:32:30]  Right about now  Alright  Let's listen  I mean  It's better than  Going without it  You ask me  No no  It's $60,000  You can put that money  To good use  The thing though  Is  How can you knock  Somebody like us  For what we do  And then you turn around  And you're paying  Right  Exactly  You're just  Yeah  Well you know  To me that is  It's the same thing  That drives me crazy  When  There's a sting operation  Or whatever  And all the  All the hookers  Go to jail  And all the jobs  Get sent home  Yeah  I mean it's the same thing  Heidi's play  She is 
[02:33:00]  You know  The guy that visits  The prostitute  Is not  Doing anything wrong  Right  You know  It's the hooker  Well excuse me  You're both fucking  Right  So  But you know  It's just men for you  I want to say one more thing  About your signing  At the ex-semblies  Pause this for a minute dude  The fact  This guy  I hope your first kid  Is born dead  Did he actually say  You can take that money 
[02:33:30]  And put it to good use  To good use  You nerd  He is  I am putting it  To good use  Here you go miss  Do what women do  That's what you do  That's why he's an engineer  Not on the radio  Absolutely  Of course you're putting it  To good use  Here's your job  That's your job  Plug and unplug  While nobody looks at you  In Jimmy's world  He's putting it to good use  That engineer  Do you understand that  Is a jackass  He's a douchebag  Who wanted some acknowledgement  Instead of coming up  And going hello 
[02:34:00]  I'm the engineer  Everybody would have  Talked to him  And said hello  We're supposed to  Like I'm supposed to  Poke Jimmy in the side  And go  Jimmy I think that's  The engineer  That's the guy  That's the guy  Let's go over  And say hi  These are guys  That want to cape  With their initials on it  But won't admit it  Right  Yeah  Alright  Well  Right  Exactly  That's pretty much it  Wait  Yeah  They were saying  Something about  Going back  Into the green room  So let's hear that  Okay  I was very happy  Oh my god  You know  Because XM just got  This baseball contract  So I went back  And there's Greg Maddux 
[02:34:30]  In there  I mean  He won like  Three-side young awards  If I had been there  The day before  With Cal Ripken  He would have seen  A different  I would have been  A bowl of jello  Oh my god  Have you seen his eyes  No  I know  He's still in the dark eyes  Oh  Nice guy  They said he was the best guy  Oh  Anyway  I think that's it  From these  But I don't know  If you heard it before  They were saying  These are the same guys  That go out 
[02:35:00]  And try to get laid  On a Saturday night  Oh yeah  They did say that before  Yes that is what I do  No you know  We don't have to try  To do anything  Trust me  Try to get laid  On a Saturday night  Alright here's the deal  To the twats  On the Playboy channel  We have a much bigger audience  So if you have a problem  With us  You call us anytime  Yeah  And we'll discuss this  Don't hide behind  Your little audience  That's getting littler  Every day  And they're going to  Probably cancel the channel  Or get new hosts  You call us up  And we'll work out  Our differences  Yeah we'll hash it out 
[02:35:30]  You want to hash it out  On the air  We'll be more than happy to  And don't say no  Come on our show  No see  We have a much bigger audience  So we'll do it right here  In our forum  Okay  We'll see what kind of  Radio chops you really do have  And that engineer  Oh  Uh  Elo  Fire him  I want him fired  He's just happy  The two chicks  Were listening to him  And he felt rejected  And embarrassed  Because nobody on the show  Talked  It wasn't  First of all  It wasn't personal  I would have spoke to the guy  We were all worried  About doing the show  We're doing a show 
[02:36:00]  It's an out  It's a very open setting  We're a little nervous  Like is this going to go well  How is this going to be  Is the equipment going to work  We're all focused on that crap  We're reading newspaper  We're just prepping for the show  You guys are being too nice  Here's the deal  Anthony and I meet so many people  Especially when we're on the road  If you don't make  Uh  An impression  Right away  You're forgotten  You're completely forgotten  That's how it works  Unbelievable  I shook your hand  And maybe 20 or 30 other hands  Probably in that same hour  You were forgotten  You're a zero 
[02:36:30]  You're a nobody  Sorry  You didn't say anything  That was stimulating  Or interesting enough  For me to go  Oh wow  I gotta remember that  That person  He was kinda interesting  It was a handshake  And that was it  I don't think about it  The guy  If I shook his hand  As one of the engineers  Hey this is  It's one of  It's one of 50 people  That I met  If he was lined up  Right now  With a bunch of  I swear on my life  I couldn't pick out the guy  I have no idea  What he looks like  Even if he was saying  I'm the engineer 
[02:37:00]  I still wouldn't know  Which one he was  Nobody looked at you stupid  Sounds like he should be a criminal  What a self important  Jackal  I can't pick him out  What a self important jackass  And just these two  This one even annoys me before  Like we first hear  That they're trashing us  Ah well let's just see  If it's true  So we don't just bash them  For no reason  Yeah  We didn't just jump up  And start trashing them  You dummies  What kind of fucking people  Did you meet  They would sound like  A guy with a viking helmet  With day glow on it  That wants to be noticed  Whores 
[02:37:30]  They were just two girls  From the playboy channel  Who host the show  Who we were erroneously nice to  But that will not happen again  But we were intimidated  Because they were the type of gals  That will really put you in your place  And nothing scares a bunch of dumb guys  Like a gal with six shooters  Don't want to get out of her  Get on her bad side guys  She's all full of piss and vinegar  Watch out for her  Look out  She's saucy  Party doesn't start  Until you walk in  Does it hon? 
[02:38:00]  Elbow to the ribs  You and your fake tits  Drop dead  Stupid  I hate fake tits  I do too  Get the surgery to get the approval  They made it the same stuff  That your lawn furniture's made of you  Might as well fuck your lounge  And God made  God made huge round tits  That don't droop  So you could be in awe  You see a pair of tits  That look like Snoopy  Worshipping the moon  And they weigh 11 pounds  That's something to thank God for  Like the Redwood  Not some asshole  In a lab who goes  More nipple  Formula 21  You know  That's bullshit  I can't wait to call Adam Farrar 
[02:38:30]  Yes  I want to thank Adam  We love Adam  We do love Adam  You're friends with Adam, right?  Yeah  He is, man  I definitely want to give him a thank you call today  Let's say hi to Brian in Brooklyn  What's up, Brian?  What's up, guys?  Hi  I think it's time for  Assault on Playboy Radio  Maybe you can get our radio call  And a couple of  That'd be fun  Attack and destroy them  Yeah 
[02:39:00]  No, don't do that  Because their listener might call us  Maybe XM can use it as a promotional  To get those bitches  Some more listeners  Attack and destroy them  And tell them they need to come on our program  To discuss this  And stop hiding behind their tiny little audience  Watch out, guys  All right  It's on  Game on  What they confused was this  You guys teasing porn stars  I'm nice to porn stars  I'm open about it  Everybody was  We're all very consistent  Yeah  And we all were extremely consistent  In the way we behaved  You guys were out of that porn place 
[02:39:30]  By 1210  Not that you hate the porn stars  But that's not your thing  No  You went and gambled  I stayed with Steve  Because A, I wanted to get audio  B, because I'm a dirtbag  That's why I stayed  And the only reason it took so long  It took 10 minutes to walk from where we were  To the front door  Right  I wanted out of there  Oh, right after  They were taking pictures with everybody  And getting autographs  Oh, they might mean me  They know I love you  I got a picture with Greg Maddox  Although, I would love to have seen her there the day before  Because she would have been Jell-O with Cal Ripken  But I probably would have matched your original tits

Dude, I love porn stars  I  I love them if I have a rosin bag  I love porn stars  And I respect the business  That's why I did well when I posted the AVN  Hey  But I'm very consistent with that  99.9% of all normal males on Earth masturbate  Not at the same time 
[02:40:30]  Because it would knock the Earth off its axis  But if you get, you know, like Bolivia up, New York down  You're cool  And I don't know what the 1% does  But I wouldn't leave town and let them watch my pet  So porn stars stimulate people to do a natural thing  Truck off  Dustin Diamond's title is in jeopardy  Please hang up and try again  I will hang up  Was that the Playboy hotline?

[02:41:00]  Cody the trucker, what's going on?  Hey, yeah  Yeah  I was just wondering why you don't just say  That you get a little, I don't care  I don't care  We don't care  We don't care  Yeah, you just  Well, no, you just don't care  The Playboy bitches  What, I don't care  Alright, punch it out  I don't care  I don't care  My chokes don't go over  I don't care  I don't care  I don't care  I don't care

You can replace me with whatever you want  I don't find right now  I don't think it's going to come close  Yeah, I mean, yeah  I go, why would that even offend me?  The only people you're going to offend is a bunch of churchgoing people who are upset about how they got pulled off the air  I said, this doesn't get to me 
[02:42:00]  I don't care  I don't care  I don't even know why they're involved with me like this  I don't care  They think I give a crap about Opie and Anthony  Or Man Cow  Or any of these guys  I don't care  I mean, you know  I just don't  Put them all on  I mean, I've seen what they can do  Fareed thinks he's going to put like Opie and Anthony on them  And get all upset about it  And then it's going to make me somehow twist in the wind  I don't care  I don't care 
[02:42:30]  I don't care if you like us  We don't like you  And guess what?  I don't care  I don't care  Your son could die in a house fire  I wouldn't even care  Do you understand?

I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  We have Chris Rush in the studio today helping us out.  Good to be here.  Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello? 
[02:46:00]  Oh, thank you, Ben. I didn't like that one. Thank you.  Let's see.  Uh-oh. I'm worried, dude.  What? What's wrong?  I don't know. I don't want to get on their bad side.  Oh, they're plucky.  Oh, those two are pips. Once they get on your...  Don't they understand? You don't want to mess with us.  Even Howard doesn't mess with us.  I don't care.  You have no idea what you're getting yourself into, ladies.  They're scary. Julie and Tiffany do a heck of a show, and they're firecrackers. 
[02:46:30]  And the sad part is, if you thought we were intimidated or had a problem with you,  you were right there. You were two feet from me.  You don't want to go down this road. You really don't.  And I guarantee they won't. They'll puss out.  They won't come on our show to discuss this.  Yes, Chris?  The whole concept of the Playboy radio show is a little confusing to me.  How do you hear a nipple or a clit?  Because any kind of advice you're going to get is going to be really lame advice. 
[02:47:00]  It's like, yeah, you go in and out. In, send out. That's right.  And swallowing is optional.  I mean, what kind of advice is this bullshit?  Playboy is to look at and aim at.  The only thing they can do to improve the magazine is Teflon treat the pages so they don't stick.  Dustin Diamond had a really good run, too, man.  He had a great run.  He had a great run.  You got to give him props for the run he had.  Damn.  You speak the truth, Chris. You speak the truth. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, man. I hope they don't find out what we said.  We were just kidding, girls.  Yeah.  I don't want them to start going off.  The wrath of those two.  Oh, and those two go.  Because do you hear when she said that if Cal Ripken had been there the next day, she would have been like Jell-O.  I'm like, man, you don't want that kind of wit coming after you.  No.  You want to stay out of her sights.  Yeah, we can't compete with that.  Oh, she's good.  They're intimidating.  We can't compete with wit like that.  I mean, a lingerie model and an over-the-hill porn actress?  I mean, my God almighty.  I can't picture two more frightening people to be across the microphones from. 
[02:48:00]  It's like a hell of a midget wrestling team.  There's just so many phonies in this business because they were right there.  Yep.  They were right there.  I was impressed that she was in what?  I think it was the Delamus Jones, actually.  I thought it was great.  Yeah.  They were very nice.  That is so aggravating when you're genuinely nice to someone and you like them and you speak highly of them off the air when they're not around.  And then you were scared of us.  And then they got to get on and bash you for some reason.  Tom from Kentucky, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[02:48:30]  What's up, Snookums?  Hi, Angel Face.  How are you?  Oh, just lovely.  The sad thing about it was is last night what y'all were trying to do was actually helping them.  And there at the end, there was a guy that called in.  He was like, oh, I heard y'all on O&A, and that's why I called in and got it.  And now there's going to be like a complete invasion on them, so they're just totally screwed.  Yeah, let's see what kind of radio they can do now if they're brave enough to even throw our callers on the air.  Even Howard's not brave enough to throw our callers on his show.  I don't care.  Yeah, we'll see how this goes. 
[02:49:00]  It's going to be a complete riot.  You guys suck.  Bye.  All right.  I'll bet you in the meeting today at least one of those dummies says, we have to batten down the hatches.  You're never going to say something awful like that.  Batten down the hatches.  Ready to do a little battle.  Well, the whole Playboy channel is failing miserably.  Of course it is.  It's bleeding money at this point.  And, you know, we were trying to do the right thing for the company and for our show because we knew we'd get some good radio out of it.  And, well, good luck to you.  We thought they were fun.  We thought they were good on the air with the show.  We enjoyed them. 
[02:49:30]  It was good.  I liked them.  Not as much as looking at some part of their body.  Which is what the hell they do professionally.  Of course.  I don't give a shit about her ovula or how well she says vowels.  It's can she crack a walnut with the cheeks of her ass.  That's where it's at.  I'm losing track of reality.  I've been up 24 hours.  You're talking to me about pussy that makes noise on the fucking radio.  Who gives a shit?  Right.  Have lost or have been better in that statement.  Let's go to Paul in Texas.  What's up, Paul?  Yeah, I thought it was kind of interesting the way you guys were talking about the ratings. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know how long you guys have been on the air now.  Three, four months.  And they've been with Nick them for who knows how long.  You know, I subscribe to your show and their show at the same time.  Just kind of check them both out.  And after four days, I had to shut them off, man.  You know, I like the erotic stories and everything.  But I don't know if you've ever heard five women in one small room giggling and cackling and crap about shopping and just...  I hate to say it, man.  Women on the radio stink. 
[02:50:30]  Can I tell you, the only time five women in a room are funny is when Richard Speck walks in.  Women on the radio, you know, they just stink.  They've been trying to get a woman to do the radio show with Anthony and I for years.  It'll never happen.  Oh, stop it.  Never happen.  I want no bitch in here.  Her stupid sensibilities.  Then they're like, well, can we just get a woman to just, you know, cackle in the background for four hours?  Oh, you.  No, that ain't gonna work either. 
[02:51:00]  Women on the radio stink.  Now, guys, they'd be here to...  A woman would be here to keep us in check.  Even keel?  Even keel.  Keep us in check.  Make sure we don't get too outrageous.  We'd laugh at that guy with his pants being pulled down by the water as his penis and she'd go, oh, well, at least he's all right.  At least he's safe and sound and with his family.  She'd ruin it with her dumb woman sensibilities.  Oh, stop it.  And then eventually they'll bring up sexual harassment charges because you said something stupid on the air.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  Exactly. 
[02:51:30]  Or she walked in and, you know, he made a remark.  All right.  Well, let's say hi to an old pal, Paul the Pilot.  Oh, here we go.  Paul.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Paul.  Sorry to make you wait for an hour, but, you know.  Eh, it's no worries.  You waited, what, a few months to wake up, so, you know, waiting an hour on the phone isn't that bad, right?  Jesus.  Yeah, it was only five weeks in a coma.  You were in a coma for five weeks?  Yeah.  Paul the Pilot was, uh...  Wow.  Wow, must have a hell of a morning mouth.  That's kind of funny.  I like that one. 
[02:52:00]  Their food didn't taste good for a while.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  What'd they do after your third week of coma?  Do they offer you a show on Playboy?  Sorry, girls.  Just kidding.  Don't want to get on your bad side.  Watch it.  Keep giving out that fun advice.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ugh.  Of course.  60,000 a year.  I wish I was in that position.  Paul?  Yes?  So, uh, walk us through it, Paul.  What happened?  Well, we gotta explain, Paul, to the new audience, though.  Paul was a huge fan of the show, the old show, when we were syndicated, and he had a... 
[02:52:30]  He's a stunt pilot, and he painted Wow! and Opie and Anthony on the side of his plane,  and used to, like, write Wow! over Manhattan.  Yeah, he did skywriting, and he would write Wow! over Manhattan on Wednesday.  And I did an air show for you guys.  Yeah, I did an air show.  All sorts of stuff he has done for us over the years.  And Opie and Anthony is still on the airplane.  Oh, cool.  Very nice.  I never took it off.  So, you know, we started getting emails from, uh, I don't know, listeners, maybe family  members, and we couldn't, couldn't, we couldn't even, we weren't sure if this was true or not. 
[02:53:00]  I mean, what happened to you?  Uh, I, I went to Florida, and I flew home in my airplane, and I drove home, and I forgot  some paperwork, and I had to go back to the airplane.  And I hit a telephone pole, and then a tree.  Did you fall asleep?  Uh, that's what they're saying I did.  Wow.  Oh, how fast were you going?  I have not a clue, but I totaled out my Dodge Booey.  Uh, uh, you weren't drunk or anything, were you?  No, no, no.  You have seatbelts on and airbags and stuff? 
[02:53:30]  I didn't have my seatbelt on.  How is a fucking pilot not wearing his seatbelts in a car?  Are you insane?  I have no, it's only three miles from my house, you know?  It doesn't matter.  You know what they say.  Yep, within 10 miles of the home.  No, Playboy sucks.  Within a mile of my home.  Do you, do you remember anything about the crash?  I mean.  Nothing at all.  The only thing that I know is what my wife and family told me.  I don't remember.  You promised to buy us a pole.  Right before you hit.  So you hit the pole, and what else? 
[02:54:00]  Well, I, I sideswiped the pole with the, with the driver's side, and then a dually,  dual axles hit the telephone pole, snapped the telephone pole,  but then it turned the truck sideways.  And the truck slid down an embankment and hit a tree and rolled up on its roof.  Holy ass.  Wow, you're lucky to be alive.  Did you have a near-death experience?  Well, my heart stopped three times.  Jiminy.  That's a lucky number, Trey.  Did you see anything when your heart stopped?  Well, I'm not afraid to die anymore, that's for sure.  Really?  Did you have the tunnel with the light, or if you're in Jersey,  did you have the tunnel light and the token boots? 
[02:54:30]  And no damn tokens.  It was just my luck.  Actually, that was very funny.  Wait, so why aren't you scared of dying anymore?  It's not that bad, I guess.  It's just, I don't know, it's kind of hard to explain.  You'd have to live through it.  Wow.  To really experience it.  But it was five and a half weeks in a coma.  All right, hold on, hold.  Before you get to that, what were your injuries?  I broke, totally smashed my nose.  They had to rebuild my nose.  I broke the CL in my left leg. 
[02:55:00]  I lacerated my spleen, my pancreas, my kidney, my liver, my small intestine.  They had to remove two ribs.  My ribs were totally smashed.  Oh, and a two-by-four came through the back window and hit me in the head.  It gave me a concussion.  A two-by-four?  Yeah, I had a load of wood on the truck.  Wow.  It's like fucking a roller derby team.  Same injuries.  I always said the most dangerous part of my job was not flying the airplane.  It was getting to and from the airport, and I guess I was right. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  So now they obviously take you out of there.  Did someone call it in?  Did you find out?  Here's the worst part.  It took them over an hour to cut me out of the vehicle, and they medevaced me out.  But the school where the helicopter landed is three houses down from my house.  So my wife and my son saw the helicopter land.  Oh, boy.  Saw them load somebody onto the helicopter, and then the helicopter took off,  and then three squad cars drove past the house, and the last one pulled in the driveway. 
[02:56:00]  Ah.  That's how they kind of knew it was me.  Wow.  But they sat there.  My wife and my son saw the whole thing.  They watched the whole thing.  They didn't know it was me, though.  So that kind of started everything.  And then you were in a coma for five and a half weeks?  Five and a half weeks, two and a half weeks on the fifth floor for recovery,  two and a half weeks in the Kessler Institute,  and another ten weeks of rehabilitation.  I had six surgeries.  But I'm doing fine now.  I'm flying again.  I've got five air shows lined up already for next year. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, jeez.  And you're moving around pretty well now?  Oh, yeah.  Everything's fine.  I'm walking.  I'm running.  You know.  They weren't sure you were going to make it for a while.  Yeah, that's what my wife said, that they were already planning my funeral  because the doctors didn't.  I also got the infection split throughout my whole body,  and it took them a long time to get.  I was on the dialysis machine for four weeks,  24 hours a day because my kidneys had failed.  You better buy 20 or 30 pounds of religious medals. 
[02:57:00]  Don't worry.  I wear one now.  Well, yeah, it was pretty rough, but I'm back to normal.  So what happened right when you woke up?  Do you remember?  I didn't have any idea where I was,  and I remember them asking me if I was married and had kids,  and I said no.  Oh, man.  My wife was standing right there.  I said, yeah, but she's kind of cute.  Wow.  I couldn't sit up in bed.  The whole room would spin.  I couldn't walk.  I couldn't do anything.  They had me on a feeding tube. 
[02:57:30]  Why would the room spin?  Why would the room spin?  Concussion?  I guess from being laid down on my back for eight weeks.  Every time I'd sit up, the whole room would just spin.  That was my biggest fear.  I needed my equilibrium in order to fly.  Yeah.  And that was really one of the biggest things when I was laying in the hospital.  I just wanted to get back into my airplane and get my life back.  So when did the accident occur?  June 8th.  So then you woke up what? 
[02:58:00]  Do the math July, August.  Five and a half weeks later.  About November sometime?  No.  Five and a half weeks?  Oh, weeks.  I was thinking months.  I'm sorry.  Still up July.  Nice math skill.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  Jesus.  Five and a half weeks.  I'm sorry.  I bet you really had to pee when you got up.  No kidding.  Yeah, but I didn't have to work at that either because I had the tube.  Oh, well, that works.  Yeah.  Yeah, but let me tell you something.  When they pull that tube out, holy cow.  Yeah, now you know what a lawnmower feels like.  Yeah, pool start. 
[02:58:30]  I get it.  It's pretty good.  Now, it was pretty bad, but I'm like 97% complete.  Thank God.  Yeah, really.  Wow.  Like I said, I've got air shows and I'm buying a new airplane.  I'm buying a Yak-55.  It's made in Russia.  I know you guys love Russia.  A Yak-55?  Isn't that old?  No.  No?  It's brand new.  A Yak?  They still make those?  You're going to fly in a plane named after a Yak, not a bird?  It's a Yak-55 with 400 worth pounds.  Oh, you're going to try a Warthog 21. 
[02:59:00]  Give me the money.  I'll buy it.  Yeah, well, you know, it's better than a rhino, which just drops.  Yeah, but everything's going good.  And I'm glad you guys are back, man.  I'll tell you, I was really upset with you.  Hey, we're glad you're back.  I was doing my drive home.  What happened to us was no big deal.  You were dealing with death.  Really?  You guys were gone for, what, two and a half years?  Yeah, well.  I was only gone for two months.  What, like, right when you woke up, did it freak you out that you were asleep for so long?  Did you, like, look at the newspaper and go, what did I miss? 
[02:59:30]  Well, I had no idea until I looked down on my stomach, because they had cut me from underneath  my ribs all the way down to my Johnson.  Wow.  And from what I understand, I was so swollen up from all the surgeries and stuff, they left  me laid open.  I had a two and a half inch gap down my belly for, like, three weeks.  They had it covered with wax.  Wax?  Yeah, well, because I was so blown up and so, you know, they couldn't put the skin back  together, because everything was swollen so much.  Can you throw up in this, Mike? 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, that's pretty nasty.  Yeah.  That's nasty, darling, a taco.  That's unbelievable, Paul.  Yeah, well, I'm lucky to be here, and I'm really glad you guys are back, though.  It's amazing that you're talking on a microphone, does it?  What you've been through, I figured you'd be communicating through a series of knocks on the table  through Madam Zora.  Well, I did that.  You did that?  Yeah, I had a trach in my throat for about three weeks after I woke up.  I couldn't talk.  Wow.  That was the worst part, is I couldn't get my message across, and then I couldn't even  write.  I was like, well, give me a piece of paper and a pen.  I'll write down what I want. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  I couldn't even write.  I mean, the handwriting was, my wife couldn't even understand what I was writing, you know?  It was like, get me the fuck out of here.  Any philosophy on life, after what you've been through?  Near-death experience?  The telephone poles, man, they're hard.  There you go.  And wear your seatbelt.  Before you fly, set your VCR for your favorite shows.  You know, I don't even understand, because I never, ever, ever drive without my seatbelt.  I didn't have my shoes on.  I broke three of my toes.  Wow, man.  Which I don't even understand why I would have been driving without my shoes or the seatbelt 
[03:01:00]  on, but...  Yeah, if you had your seatbelt on, did they tell you, you know, what might have been?  I would have died.  If you had it on?  Break your back.  Why is that?  Because the truck rolled up against a tree, and it crushed the roof down.  And when they found me, I was laying in the front seat across the armrest and in the back  seat, and the roof had totally crushed the driver's seat.  If there was anybody in the passenger seat, they would have died instantly.  The passenger door was all the way in, touching the armrest. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, wow.  I mean, it was totally, the truck's totally demolished, and I'm really pissed about it,  because I had 280,000 miles on that truck, and I loved it.  You got a picture of that truck?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I went down and took a look at it.  I couldn't believe I lived through that.  Yeah.  Well...  I mean, every window was broken.  Like I said, it took them over an hour to cut me out.  Is it totaled?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I got 1,500 bucks for it.  Wow.  1,500 bucks?  Yeah, for the motor.  And then I found out the guy sold the motor for $4,500.  I was really pissed.  You bastards. 
[03:02:00]  They take the spleen out?  Did they remove your spleen?  My spleen was moved up underneath my liver, I think.  Wow.  You get a good price in Mexico on that.  Yeah, well, I'm up to $2 million.  Really?  Yeah.  Thank God for Walmart.  My wife works at Walmart.  We have the insurance.  So Walmart paid for everything.  Oh, wow.  I thought they did the surgery.  You mean the bill was $2 million?  Yeah, the helicopter ride alone was $16,000.  It was an eight-minute ride. 
[03:02:30]  How do they get away with that stuff?  First class?  Really?  Who, the peanuts?  Good?  Jesus.  Did XM book your helicopter ride?  Did you have to stop off in Massapequa and get on another helicopter?  Well, according to my wife, I had lots of helicopter rides because they had me on fentanyl,  which is like 100 times more potent than morphine.  Wow.  So I was hallucinating, and I kept thinking that they were taking me for helicopter rides.  Aw.  I was on a boat.  They had me in a bed that constantly moved when I was in the coma, and I kept dreaming I was on a boat. 
[03:03:00]  You remember dreaming during your coma?  Oh, yeah.  I remember seeing my grandparents and friends of mine that had died.  Wow.  It was really weird.  I can't explain it to you, but it was definitely an eye-opener.  Hmm.  And I don't wish that on anybody.  I mean, they had me tied to the bed for weeks because I kept pulling the trach out,  and I had like nine IVs all in one arm and like six in the other, and I kept pulling the needles out.  Hey, did you know you were in a coma or something? 
[03:03:30]  I mean, like, because that's always claustrophobic for me.  Did you have any idea that your condition was what it was?  No.  Oh, okay.  I know I feel incredibly lucky now.  It took me a couple of weeks after I woke up to even realize that I was in a hospital.  So, you know, and then I looked down, and, you know, there was all stitches on my belly  and everything.  It was like, it was not something pleasant for anybody, I can imagine.  Wow.  I actually wound up in the hospital recently, man.  I caught a flash flood with my car, and they were trying to rescue me, and I let go of the  rope, and I fell down half nude in the water. 
[03:04:00]  Like that guy the other day.  Did it hurt as much as when they pixelated your dick?  That's funny.  It's warming up.  I like that.  All right.  Hey, Paul, we're glad you're alive, obviously, and it's good to see you doing well, and we  can't wait to see you flying again.  Yeah.  I'm definitely going to advertise you guys again, and I want to put XM on there.  Oh, cool.  We've got a logo for you.  I've got to make sure it's all right with the company, and they're going to want the  right colors and all that stuff.  Yeah.  Well, keep in touch, and come in and see us soon, all right? 
[03:04:30]  I definitely will, guys.  All right.  There he goes.  Take care, man.  Thanks a lot.  I'm really glad you guys are back.  All right.  Thanks, Paul.  Bye-bye.  Definitely likewise.  It's great news.  I'm glad he's all right.  Yeah, because that was grim when they gave us the news on that.  It was like, oh, man, he ain't going to make it.  Yeah.  How about the fact that he flew and nothing happens, gets in a car, and gets a little fucked up?  Yeah, gets in a car.  Doesn't wear his goddamn seatbelt.  Right.  God, you've got to put that stupid thing on, even though they said it would have killed him.  Yeah, but-  But you don't know.  Yeah.  You just don't know.  Normally, the actual impact, I think most times, the seatbelt helps you. 
[03:05:00]  If the truck rolls, that's just one of those things.  Yeah.  All right.  Scott-  Kenny won't wear his seatbelt.  Huh?  Kenny never wears a belt.  Kenny doesn't wear a seatbelt?  Nope.  I don't want to be trapped in the car.  Big and stupid.  Yeah.  Scott in Jersey, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just want to let you know, during the break, I checked out Howard, and he was not caring anymore.  Really?  Again?  Again.  He's not caring again?  God damn, he doesn't care so much every day.  He better be careful, or we'll stick those Playboy girls on him.  Oh, that's the atom bomb. 
[03:05:30]  I'll tell you, when those two get after you, watch out.  What was he not caring about today?  You guys, Opie and Anthony, it was Mancow and Anthony, and he was trying to be funny.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  He failed.  Oh, boy.  That's terrific.  That's cute.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  He's not caring again today, Ant.  He doesn't care.  Chris from Connecticut, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, you guys were talking about your callers being, they should be fearing your callers. 
[03:06:00]  That John and Jeff show or whatever, every night they're getting flooded with Opie and  Anthony listeners, just all kinds of references.  They actually, someone called with a story about Monster Rain, and they end up turning into  like an Howard topic that they were talking, they didn't even realize.  All right, we're giving them material.  That's good.  We really are just dicks.  No, we're not.  Look, John and Jeff, I'm sorry.  You're corn balls.  I listen to the show.  It's not funny.  What do you want to tell you?  I don't care about them.  I don't care.  Why would I care? 
[03:06:30]  Corn balls.  All right.  Well, we should take a break here, huh?  All righty.  Wow.  This, this, wow.  She's coming in to say hi?  She's here.  Man.  What?  She's in doing her paperwork with Master Poe at the moment.  Yeah.  That should be in at 1130.  Exactly.  What's her name?  Sabrina Sikora.  She got kicked off the Sports Illustrated show.  For what?  Look at this.  Hopefully for drinking out of a comic's mule.  Unbelievable.  Was it an anti-Semitic comment she made?  Because she looks like the product of genetic breeding. 
[03:07:00]  Wow.  The blonde hair and the little pointy nipples.  Look at the legs on this girl.  Look at the arm band.  That's funny.  That's very funny.  I want to see an Armenian girl with a mustache and a mole.  This is why we fought World War II, these fucking girls. 
[03:07:30]  Ben, shut up, Ben.  Goddamn Ben.  That's fucking hackling in the background.  I love it.  Huh?  Honey.  I'm waiting.  I want to talk to Julie, but I guess Danny's still talking to her.  Julie.  Hey.  Another girl.  And look, Lisa, we got girls calling.  We got girls calling.  I love a girls call.  Uh-oh.  Let's say hi to Julie.  Julie, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I was just, um...  Wait, you're not Julie from Julie and Tiffany, are you?  No.  Oh, thank God. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, my God.  I was getting all nervous.  I was getting very intimidated just by that name.  Oh, you don't want her unloading on you.  Wow.  Uh-huh.  She is a rifle.  Oh, yeah.  Just wanted to call.  I actually can't get you guys in the office, unfortunately.  And the only radio station I do get is power to the morning.  Okay.  And he just went on for a half-hour tangent about all of you, and, quote, he says, it's  a compliment that you guys were put on in Syracuse because the biggest thing out, he's the biggest 
[03:08:30]  thing out there, and that a way to fuse it is just not to care.  So I thought that was pretty interesting.  This is so funny.  He goes on to say, Anthony, he goes on to say that, um, you know, he was quoting you, that  you stating that he doesn't care means that he does truly care, but he really doesn't  care.  Oh, that was zen.  That was zen.  Isn't that classic?  That's funny.  That's funny.  I don't care.  That's so funny.  Thank you.  And that went on for a half an hour with a guy in Syracuse bitching and moaning that 
[03:09:00]  you guys are on the radio.  It's so funny how much he cares.  He had a half hour of, uh, of time to fill.  Not having to produce radio.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what he, I mean, I know his game.  He doesn't want to do a radio show anymore.  Spends a half hour talking about how he's getting kicked off stations, half hour about  the FCC, half hour about Bush, and then next thing you know, you're, as the listener, going,  oh my God, he's not entertaining me anymore.  But the thing is that he runs over, like, by 40 minutes every day about not caring.  About not caring.  He really, you know, he should learn from Lenny Bruce. 
[03:09:30]  I know, I know Lenny was, uh, one of his heroes growing up and Lenny, uh, Bruce destroyed  his career doing the exact same thing.  Lenny spent what?  At the end of his life, he spent like hours on stage just reading his, uh, his court transcripts  instead of, instead of like, uh, doing comedy.  Yeah.  I hope he totally just burns up like Steve.  All right.  Thank you, Julie.  Bye, Julie.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  You know, it's entertaining now, but you know, eventually it gets old.  Right in? 
[03:10:00]  That's right.  Work for Jesus.  I mean, he still dominates dashboard toys in paraphernalia years after the bitching.  Can't wait to call Adam.  He keeps saying that.  I know.  Adam's going to kick my ass.  No, no, not at all.  A lot of people.  Oh, what?  I was going to say a lot of people checking in on instant feedback.  Uh, holy fuck.  Another, I don't care shit spew from Stern.  Uh, sorry to butt in how he still doesn't care. 
[03:10:30]  Everyone's checking in about how much he doesn't care.  Well, and then we'll go to break with this, Anthony.  All right.  What, you're pulling me off the air?  Then they did a stunt where they replaced us with Opie and Anthony while we were, you  know, like their best of show.  And I go, why would I care? 
[03:11:00]  You can replace me with whatever you want.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I go, why would that even offend me?  The only thing you're going to offend is a bunch of churchgoing people who are upset about  how they got pulled off the air.  I said, this doesn't get to me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't even know why you're involved with me like this.  They think I give a crap about Opie and Anthony or Mancow or any of these guys. 
[03:11:30]  I don't care.  Put them all on.  I mean, you know, I just don't put them all on.  I mean, I've seen what they can do.  Three things you're going to put like Opie and Anthony on them and you're all upset about  it and that's going to make me somehow twist in the wind.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
[03:12:00]  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care about these words.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Let's listen in on a show prep meeting in the Opie and Anthony laboratory.  Hey, guys, anyone want a bagel?

[03:14:30]  Pretty crazy show today.  We're actually entertaining here today and Howard's not caring about anything.  I don't care.  He just doesn't care.  I just don't care.  We got a very hot Sports Illustrated potential model. 
[03:15:00]  I guess she got kicked off the Sports Illustrated reality show.  I don't even know what this show's about.  Sabrina will tell us.  She's beautiful.  And Master Poe is fixing her hair or doing something over there.  I was walking by Master Poe's little area and I don't know what the hell was going on.  Has he set up a salon?  I don't know, man.  I know he pretty much hits on every girl that comes through here, but now he's hitting on supermodels.  By hitting, you don't mean like literally.  He can break a brick with his foreskin. 
[03:15:30]  You know, Master Poe is an advanced martial artist.  He is indeed.  We love the Master Poe.  Let's see.  Okay.  We have the Playboy audio, the clean version, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  Well, no, that is actually the phone call that we took when they were on our show that they claimed was a setup.  Oh, okay.  They have.  All right, what do we got, Eric? 
[03:16:00]  They have it in the dilette.  They have the actual Playboy show of them ragging us.  Let's hear the call that they say we set them up, which no one on this show sets people up like that.  We don't do it.  Yeah.  And it wasn't a call like, they suck, they're terrible.  Well, there wasn't some venom-filled call with some guy going, they give bad advice.  Okay, address it.  And they addressed it.  Is that it?  Yeah.  All right, so here's the call.  I guess we can listen to a little bit of the call.  When they first came on?  See if it was a setup.  This is when they first came on with us in Las Vegas.  Dan from Wisconsin has a problem. 
[03:16:30]  Let's say hi to Dan.  Dan, what's up?  Danny.  Dan?  We got you?  Yeah.  Hey, Dan, go ahead.  Julian and Tiffany aren't there yet, are they?  No, they're coming in a second.  Why are you going to bash them?  Because their show is lame.  They offer lame advice, and I feel sorry for anyone who has to pay $4 a month for their show.  It's $2 a month.  Where are they?  No, it's $3.99 a month.  Oh, is it?  Oh.  So, you don't like their show? 
[03:17:00]  I like their show.  When I've heard of it, I've liked it.  This guy.  So far, we're nothing but nice to them.  Yeah, real bashing.  That's real horrible stuff.  I don't see anything nasty there.  But I'll tell you, spending this much time on this doesn't give me a lot of hope for Israel and Palestine.  You know?  Gaza is a little bit more nitty.  You're kind of making a mountain out of a molehill.  Is that what you're saying there?  Yeah.  Well, we have nothing else to go to today. 
[03:17:30]  That's the reason.  Well, they're going to have the guys rock.  Oh, let me see that.  What's the rest of that audio?  I definitely want to hear that because I know that.  Is that her?  Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got more pictures over here.  All right.  Well, here's a...  This chick doesn't stop bugging me for my number.  So, so far, there's nothing there, really.  We're nothing but cordial to them.  Hey, man.  And if you listen to some of the guys who call in asking for help, you know, they just  pull whatever out of their butts, you know? 
[03:18:00]  They're pulling stuff out of their butts and you don't like that?  You sound like a guy who's an expert.  Maybe you should give advice.  Julie, this is a horrible way to meet, but this guy doesn't like your show.  See, I even acknowledge that it's a horrible way to meet because we didn't...  I mean, there are times, you know, Jim was actually lying.  There are times, yeah, I'll set up people bad.  Real bad.  But in this case, we just took this call.  You know what I mean by setup is, not that you wouldn't allow them to get punched in the  face verbally, but it's not like a phony phone call setup, like we have a guy calling in. 
[03:18:30]  That's when they said setup.  I'm thinking they mean that we had a guy.  Okay, call in and do that.  No, we don't do that.  Oh, not at all.  No, no, no.  It was just a listener with an honest opinion or whatever.  Whatever.  He's like, I don't like this, you know?  I don't think...  So the tsunami?  Sir, what's an example of advice that you think that was bad?  Maybe the advice was good.  She's got a problem with butt hair.  This guy calls in and he's talking about butt hair or whatever.  She's like, shave it off, you know?  No girl deserves to go through that. 
[03:19:00]  But his girlfriend or something says that she actually likes it, you know?  Don't shave it, just trim it.  Yeah.  Hello.  Can you imagine shaving your a-hole?  No.  Crickly when it grows back?  Just keep it trimmed.  I mean, we're going to lick around there.  We don't want pukes, you know?  Like you're holding a pin cushion between your teeth.  Wait, exactly.  Hey, we're all fun and nice.  There's something to be said for a smooth hiney, and I'm not just quoting the Michael Jackson article again.  Which we really got to get to in a few minutes here. 
[03:19:30]  All right, well, Dan, you don't like the show.  There's plenty of people that are enjoying them.  You know what?  That's why XM has over, what, 100 stations?  Right.  There you go.  Yeah, the only one that gives you a rod each time, and this one doesn't do that, so I don't  think you're doing your job.  In this guy's defense, he sounds like a very exciting guy that probably needs a lot more.  Let me tell you, it just seems like you're advised to shut up.  What do you find exciting, then?  I like the sexy stories. 
[03:20:00]  All right, so you like their show, then?  You like that segment of their show?  That's not part of their show, though.  That's pretty funny.  I like the sexy stories.  Well, they do a different type of show.  Not their show.  What do you want to do, just whack your bag 24 hours a day on the station?  The guy didn't like ass hair advice, and he's freaking out about it?  I want to know what he would like us to talk about.  Like, what's sexy to you?  Well, yeah.  Besides sexy stories, give us some of your key.  Well, it's kind of hard to be sexy on the radio, and sexy to me is, like, sexy stories.  Give us some of your past stories of... 
[03:20:30]  Why don't you give one, she's saying.  Why don't you say something that you think is sexy, so she'll have an idea of what it is that you're looking for.  How about you find sexy?  I've done with her boyfriends in the past.  How about you say something?  What do you'd like to do with...  Go ahead.  Give the girls a sexy story, sir.  A real one.  Uh, well, I'm an 18-year-old boy, and a couple years ago, I was with this girl, and her parents really didn't like me,  so I'd take her to the woods and do things with her, do oral favors, and, uh... 
[03:21:00]  How many years younger than you is she?  Uh, three.  All right.  Are you wanking off right now?  Sounds like it does.  He's out of breath.  See, I think you're weird.  Like, you're actually jacking off to Opie and Anthony, and you don't like our show.  That's why he doesn't like us.  All right.  I think he's gay.  I want to hear his erotic story about last prom night.  Well, I was home alone, whacking off with a...  All right, Dan, you don't like the show.  Come on.  I know you were doing this.  Believe me, I know I'm a zero.  I just don't criticize hot chicks because I didn't give the advice I wanted them to give. 
[03:21:30]  Aw.  I was in the woods with a girl, and I hit her in the head with a shovel and buried the  body in a shallow grave.  Who's more exciting, Dan from Wisconsin or Super Agent Bob Eatman?  Oh, I think that is Super Agent Bob Eatman.  I don't like your show.  You need new representation.  He's mad because you wouldn't tell him how to dig easier in January when the ground is  frozen.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye, fella.  There you go.  Well, that's a bad way to meet each other. 
[03:22:00]  I'm sorry, girls.  Well, it's okay.  We like critique.  We like to hear all, you know?  Absolutely.  Give it to us.  That's a liar.  Yeah, a big line.  Obviously, they didn't think it was okay because then they went on their show and thought we  set them up.  All we did in that whole segment, and this is what makes me really irritated, is back  them up, make fun of him.  It's like if we were setting you up, do you really think that's the lame way we're going  to go?  Yeah.  You dummies.  God, that annoys me.  They didn't really give advice.  Like, if you have a problem with premature ejaculation, rub it with a Turkish towel for 
[03:22:30]  a while.  Stuff that works.  I mean, I read in a book.  A Turkish towel?  Yeah.  What the hell is a Turkish towel?  I'm calling you out on your...  A terry cloth.  Oh, okay.  I don't want to sound, you know, politically incorrect by saying a Turkish towel.  You know, but terry cloth.  That's what it is.  All right.  Yeah.  All we did was side with them and make fun of the caller, and those assholes thought  we were intimidated by them and said, God, does that make me want to vomit? 
[03:23:00]  T-Bones from Boston has a Howie Care update.  Howard just breathed a sigh of relief that he's still on in Rochester, but then he said  he didn't care, but then he said he needed to have a meeting with someone, and then he  didn't care again.  Thank you, T-Bones, for that little update.  I love the I don't care updates.  The Howard I don't care updates.  What a douche.  He just didn't care.  Fantastic. 
[03:23:30]  I love it.  Let's go to Boris the Russian.  Boris.  Boris the spider.  Boris.  Boris the spider.  Hello, Boris.  How are you today?  I am very, very well.  Isn't Russia so much better than America?  Yes.  It's a very beautiful country.  Aren't we so much superior to the Americans?  Stupid.  He buy airplane.  It comes with bubbly in cockpit. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, Paul bought a Russian plane.  And Boris is going to explain why.  You remember the tirade you had about Indonesia and the Russian complaining, no bubbly?  Yes.  This plane come with bubbly.  That's the reason we buy.  In my country.  What a country.  It's the best.  Yakov Smirnoff is the best.  Thank you, Boris. 
[03:24:30]  Punch out.  Say hello to Natasha.  I will.  He's going to find it hard to penetrate the CIA.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  I wish Yakov was here at this moment.  Where is Yakov?  Where is Yakov when you need him?  What the country.  Miles, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  With this great run of Chris Rush, should we expect Shucky Ducky next? 
[03:25:00]  Who?  He's a black comedian, I think.  An awful black comedian.  Is he awful?  Who's Shucky Ducky?  Shucky Ducky's a black comic.  I've heard his name, but I don't know what he does.  He's awful, just like Chris Rush.  Oh, shut up.  You're really, Chris Rush?  I'm awful?  What an asshole, man.  I'm one of the best comedians crawling around the earth.  Yeah, it's very obvious that you don't know what funny is, sir.  Opie, are you setting up?  Did you set that call up?  Of course I don't.  Is that a setup?  I can't read what they want to talk about, you idiot.  They don't like the advice Chris Rush has given. 
[03:25:30]  That's right.  Violet, what's up?  What's his name?  Chris Rush?  I thought you had soupy sails in there for a minute.  He sucks.  What's wrong with soupy?  Dude, you suck my dick.  I'm sorry.  Oh my God, Violet.  First of all, you are a chick.  You don't have a dick though, Violet.  Well, not since the operation.  You're going to get scraped off on the side of a drainage ditch?  Your insult is not accurate.  You don't have a dick.  That's right.  Although, if you do have a very meaty area that could resemble a dick because your vagina  is so puffy, please email me at yellowtreats at AOL.com. 
[03:26:00]  I'm a big fan of the vagina that looks like it smoked the exploding cartoon cigar.  Well, if you want to judge for yourself, we can play Guess What's in My Pants.  I'd love to.  Oh, I would love to.  I've never seen elephantitis at a clip before.  Do we have time though?  Because we have that...  Well, you know, I've been rubbing it with a Turkish towel.  With the Turkish guy in it.  She brings back the Turkish towel.  I love the callback, Violet.  Very nice.  Maybe we could have you on the show next. 
[03:26:30]  All right.  Well, you know, I'm waiting in line to get on that hot show on Playboy Channel.  I tell you, man.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Please, just no more bad-mouthing these two.  They're going to go off tonight, and they are really going to get us.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, they're intimidating.  Yeah, they're...  I don't know.  All right.  You heard what?  They really, you know, it's sort of like people read Playboys for the articles.  Hold on, hold on.  Listening to them for their intellectual...  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Violet.  Augustus, what do you mean you heard tonight's show already? 
[03:27:00]  Parts of it's pre-recorded.  Parts of it's pre-recorded?  These phony bitches don't even go live?  Mm-mm.  Are they probably going to gather up and call friends, or could you call on the show to  act like we have an audience?  Oof, you suck.  Thank you, Violet.  All right.  Thank you, boys.  What had...  Oh, never mind.  Oh, so the O&A callers probably won't get on because they're pre-recorded.  We have another I don't care update coming in from Ohio.  Ohio.  Yes, Tony?  Hey, guys.  I love our name.  Just keep putting a foot deeper and deeper, man.  Yeah?  They're talking about, I guess, one of the channels, ABC or something, just said that 
[03:27:30]  Infinity and Clear Channel are joining hands to put out commercials against satellite  radio.  And he goes, well, you know, if you spend that kind of money and time on something, saying  how bad it is, it must be really good.  Oh, that's classic.  So he's saying if you say you don't care so much, then you must.  Oh, but he doesn't care, so...  I don't care.  What a...  What a douche.  Who cares?  Who cares? 
[03:28:00]  All right.  We have the audio...  What do we have the audio of that you just handed me?  That's Mini-Me on The Surreal Life.  Oh, we were talking about this earlier.  Mini-Me drunk?  We're all over the place.  I believe so.  Drunk and peeing.  And peeing.  How about the audio of him in bed?  We have that?  We're going to get more of the audio.  We're going to get China snoring for tomorrow and some more of the Mini-Me.  But let's hear this.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[03:28:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Holy Jesus.  That was him in the bed saying, like, I'm all right.  I'm all right.  It could be the funniest thing I've ever heard.  I need that online machine.  No, no, no, no.  Do not give that one to Anthony.  Give it to my...  No, I need...  But we both get it.  You have too many on yours.  No, I want that one.  I want that one, too.  I absolutely want that one, too.  Come on.  I got boring ones on mine.  I want a cool one.  No, I need that one.  Come on, Ant.  I'll get rid of that. 
[03:29:00]  We'll both have it.  No, I won't.  There are certain circumstances you never know where to choose.  I want our listeners to know that it came from me when that...  Get the fuck out of here!  I want that one.  No, I need it, too.  We're going to fight.  That's a classic one.  We're going to fight.  There's already a couple that I would have liked to have had that you have.  Oh, which one do you like from my machine?  I got...  You're a couple.  I got, like...  I'll trade you...  I don't need that guy.  How about we trade?  You have that guy.  I don't care about that guy.  How about we trade?  Give me that one, and you can have one of mine. 
[03:29:30]  Here, I'll give you this one.  No, I don't want that guy.  I don't have crickets.  That could have come in handy.  I'd give it to you, but the button's worn out.  I don't have to replace the button.  How about...  I'll give you this.  Why on earth would you deny both of us having that?  Why would you deny both of us having that?  Because it's too good.  But I want it, too.  I'll give you this one. 
[03:30:00]  I don't want that one.  Why?  Because you do a great job at that one.  Oh, thank you.  I know when to use that clip.  I'll give you one of my okay terrifics.  No, I don't want that.  I'll give you an okay...  Okay, terrific.  I'll give you an okay terrific, and I'll even sacrifice my favorite clip, this one.  No.  That's terrific.  No, I like that one, but no.  Let me hear the mini-me again.  All right. 
[03:30:30]  You should always shoot your food.  No, I need that.  There's nothing on there you could trade for that.  No, come on.  I must have that one.  I'm all right.  All right.  All right.  I'm all right.  That's funny.  What a...  Wow.  What a drunken little midget.  All right.  All right.  And then he just sounds like a broken kazoo.  What, do you have a shot of beer?  Sounds like a model airplane. 
[03:31:00]  Holy crap.  You can't have those.  What a mess.  No, I need that.  I need that.  That must be.  Wait, let me try.  You know how much I want that clip?  I don't care if I get it.  I don't care.  We interrupt this program to bring you the Bozo Nidget Sighting of the Day. 
[03:31:30]  Meanwhile, back at the show...  That is the funniest goddamn sound ever to come out of anything.  It really is.  Wow, that's good. 
[03:32:00]  We're going to have to go to court and see who gets custody of that.  I don't have many on my machine yet.  But that's my job.  Yeah, but you don't do a good job with your job.  What the fuck?  Are you insane?  Are you crazy?  You got too many over there.  Too many?  I got maybe 30 here.  You got hundreds.  Too many?  You have too many.  Here, I'll give you this one.  That's what I'm talking about.  Stupid!  You're so stupid! 
[03:32:30]  No, I used to have that one, and I don't want it anymore.  No, no.  Listen to the replay.  You played it at an appropriate point in the show this morning.  Which one?  Oh, what?  Wait, which one?  The one you threw in that didn't make any sense?  Which one?  Or maybe you throw in Earl where it doesn't make any sense.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  That was over the intro of the show.  What?  What?  All right, I'll give you this one.  I hate this place!  No, I don't want that one.  Why?  I want mini-me. 
[03:33:00]  All right, but you can't have the I Don't Care song.  No.  Because we're going to be using this one a lot.  No, that's fine.  All right.  I got to have mini-me.  Look, I'm not saying you shouldn't have it, too.  That should be split between both machines.  Because I, you know, I think I can handle this one a little better than he can.  Get out of here!  How do you even, I've been, what?  I've been working this machine for five years!  I'll use it more appropriately.  How would you use it more appropriately?  I don't know. 
[03:33:30]  I'll just, you know, I'll push the button.  Use it at the beginning of the show for the intro, things like that, and I will use it where  it comes in handy.  All right, but you can't...  If someone, put it this way.  Right.  If someone walked into our studio as a guest, and they were really short, and we were all  laughing, and wanted to goof on how short they were without actually saying it, I would  hit that button.  You might not be inclined to do it, and if I thought it, and you didn't, people wouldn't  get the enjoyment of knowing that there's a short person walking into the studio.  Or how about this? 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  Whenever it's time to use the button, I'll just yell, hit the mini-me clip.  Hit the mini-me clip.  Someone.  Yeah.  Can I have it, too, at least?  I have no problem with you also having it.  I think you should share.  Why did you want exclusivity?  That's what I don't understand.  Yeah, it's too good.  It is very good.  It's so good, it needs to be on both machines.  You got all the fun shut-up ones.  You have shut-up ones.  I don't think I have a shut-up one.  I don't have any.  I don't feel bad for either one of you tools.  You're supposed to give me the new shut-up one.  Tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right.  Shut up! 
[03:34:30]  Shut the fuck!  You're all right to take me.  Shut up!  Will you shut up!  Shut up!  Shut!  Shut!  Shut!  Shut!  Shut up!  Shut up!  By the way...  I love that one.  By the way, proving that you were at...  asleep at the wheel today.  Why?  We could have used that clip at least 20 times today.  I like your approach better.  See, I would sit back sometimes and not even do that.  I like the subtle approach on that whole thing.  So you think it's subtle is better at times? 
[03:35:00]  See, I wasn't stepping on you.  I thought that worked quite nicely.  So we got, um...  Who's here, uh...  Sabrina Sikora.  Wow.  Nice.  Chris Rush in the...  Where are you going?  That's what you're saying.  I gotta...  I gotta leave soon.  Ah.  No, no one would ever say that to your face.  Yes, they would.  They'd call in.  Hi, you suck!  Shut up!  Shut up!  That's when I wanted to shut up thing here. 
[03:35:30]  Will you shut up?  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  You really believed that...  Shut up!  My approach was better.  Are you insane?  I liked it.  All right, let's take a break.  And we're going to talk to Sabrina next.  Sabrina Sikora.  She's lovely.  She's beautiful.  She's been eyeing me up since you walked in, too.  Yeah.  And, uh, wait.  Pete from Astoria.  I was born in Astoria.  Pete.  Now all Greek there.  Pete.  Pete, what's up?  What's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi, Pete. 
[03:36:00]  How's everybody doing this morning?  Imagine if his last name was Moss.  I don't know if it sounds like to anyone else, but it sounded like he was having sex in that clip.  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  Ah.  No, what happened was he was, um, laying...  Wait, where is it?  I want to play it now.  The mini-meat clip.  It sounds like he's having sex.  I don't know what it sounds like, actually.  He's laying in the bed drunk, and Christopher Knight is comforting him.  Instead of just biting his arm and chest like he should be, a little fat piece of Play-Doh.  He played Montserrat. 
[03:36:30]  A little oven-stuffer roaster body.  That's exactly what he looks like, a Cornish game hen.  Should be gutted and fed to people.  He's sitting around drinking, waiting for Mike Myers' next phone call.  Dude, you gotta see.  There's a scene where he's sitting on a ledge, and him and Christopher Knight are drinking,  and he actually takes...  He gets drunk, and he falls back, and, like, kind of almost passes out, but he's such a  little nothing that he's like...  There's no bending.  It's like he all just falls back at once. 
[03:37:00]  It's like a Stonehenge type of thing.  He just falls back at once.  Just one piece.  Like a weevil.  No joints on him.  No.  You want to just pick him up by the legs and pull the last 30 seconds of Caligula out  and smash his face on the steps.  All right, as we go to break, we'll play our newest clip.  Our new clip.  Anthony's newest sound clip. 
[03:37:30]  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony.  F-U-I.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you out to fucking Marty Schottenheimer.  You fucking losing cocksucker.  Fuck you.  I'll tell you what.  You are such a fucking loser.  I feel sorry for all you people out in San Diego.  You thought this motherfucker was gonna be your Jesus Christ. 
[03:38:00]  Hey, fuck you, man.  I'll tell you what.  Marty Schottenheimer, you're such a fucking loser.  You couldn't even fucking get a fucking nigger jacked up on crack,  stuffed full of Viagra,  into a fucking piece of pussy.  Fuck you, you motherfucker.  I'd like to leave a big fuck you to my fucking girlfriend of five years  for fucking leaving me for a fucking dorky.  Fuck you, whore.  Fuck you, you fucking dorky.  Private Snowball.  Fuck you. 
[03:38:30]  Fuck you.  I want to send a big fuck you to Norton  for calling you the Pogam.  I'm getting so fucking sick of hearing that.  Norton, great comic.  Love your material.  Got your CD, Yellow Discipline.  Got it at eagerbullet.com.  But I'm fucking so sick of hearing you say Pogam.  Fuck you, man.  Fuck you.  Shut up.  Don't say that.  Goodbye.  Yeah, this fuck you goes to Jimmy Norton  because, you know, I'm gay.  I enjoy your show.  But a lot of the thoughts you have  are the same thoughts that I have. 
[03:39:00]  And I kind of think he's gay, too, you know?  In fact, I'm pretty much sure  under all that bullshit,  he's a gay little faggot just like me.  Hello, how are you?  This is Steve from San Diego, California.  I just want to say a big fuck you to Howard Stern.  Kiss my ass, you donkey, stupid,  fucking suck your own dick.  I love Opie and Anthony,  and they're the best things that ever happened to me.  The best entertainment. 
[03:39:30]  I hope you guys go on strong.  I listen to you in my house, my car, on the beach.  Can't get enough of you.  Keep up the good work.  Come out to the fucking AVN Awards  to see you fucking street jerk-offs,  and I have a fucking midget sighting,  and I got nobody to fucking talk to.  Fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line  at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.

[03:42:30]  I just want to try something here.  I don't even know if it's going to work.  Oh, my God.  That feels so good.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, slow down.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Place my balls.  Place my balls.  Oh, that feels so good.  Yeah, just roll them around.  That is so good.  Oh, man.  What the hell is it we're doing?  Uh-oh.  Slow down. 
[03:43:00]  Don't move.  I'll go get you a towel.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Wow, is that sad?  It just gets funnier and funnier.  I'm all right?  Is that what he's saying?  Awful, bald, nothing.  I actually, I know Mini-Me just got a new headshot.  Where his head is tilted, and he's wearing an old school jacket, and he's holding a fedora. 
[03:43:30]  Yuck.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ugh.  It was a good call, too.  I'm surprised that dumbbell wasn't crying through the Mini-Me clip.  This is sad, dude.  He has a drinking problem.  Why are a lot of people saying on the instant feedback, bring back Pablo Picasso.  Pablo.  Pablo Picasso.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Nice.  He was a fine guest in 1948.  Yes. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, I just blew it.  Oh.  Whatever.  A lot of people are asking to bring back Pablo Francisco.  It doesn't work if you mess up the first time.  Pablo Picasso.  I understand that now.  Let's bring in Sabrina.  Bring in Sabrina.  Yes.  Oh, points to Steve.  Yes.  Yes.  You're a beautiful woman.  Woman.  Woman.  Holy mackerel.  I'll sit.  Wow.  Hey.  Hi, Sabrina.  Hi, hi, hi.  How there you are.  You're very, very tall. 
[03:44:30]  Statuesque.  Thank you.  How tall are you?  I'm six feet without the shoes on.  Without the shoes.  Yeah.  Six one, six two when you have to, you know, get dressed up, right?  About six four.  Six four.  Yeah, because I normally wear big heels.  Wow.  How do you find guys?  You got to be pretty tall, right?  Not too bad.  No, my boyfriend's six feet.  Yeah.  And I'm not opposed to dating somebody shorter than me.  Would you date Jimmy?  Someone my height, maybe.  I'm like five six.  Yeah.  I'm a real firecracker.  You have confidence to go along with it. 
[03:45:00]  You're not afraid to stand with a six foot four woman.  No, I don't please.  Not at all.  She's looking at you thinking, well, the height's not the real problem here.  Because everyone always looks at the guy, the shorter guy.  What does that mean?  That's like a beautiful tall girl.  Shut up.  Let it go.  Let it go.  What does that mean?  Let it go.  I don't know what that meant.  I'm bombing horribly this last hour.  Let it go.  Bring back Chris Rush, please.  Damn, I missed it.  I didn't hear it.  I know.  I missed it.  Damn. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  Height.  I'm not even going to try again.  Have you seen this video, Sabrina, of the naked guy getting rescued?  I did last night, actually.  What do you think of the guy?  You feel bad for him?  It's a good personality test.  At least he got rescued.  Is it funny for you?  At least he got rescued.  But how funny is it?  Come on.  It might be a little awkward to show your family the rescue tape.  There you go.  Yeah.  Yeah, because we're thinking like his Johnson was scraped on the way up.  Especially if your kid blurts out, I haven't seen that since you tucked me in.  Oh, God.  That's horrible. 
[03:46:00]  He is a despicable person.  Yeah, don't mind him.  Please.  Sorry.  She's closing her eyes and going, make him go away.  Oh.  No?  So you were...  You were...  Jimmy.  Be nice.  Jimmy, suck in your gut, please.  We have a very...  Oh, God.  Nice young lady.  He's sitting there.  There's a beautiful girl in here.  And he's pushing out his belly.  I'm actually not pushing you.  I'm just standing.  Just standing.  Okay.  So what's this show about?  I haven't seen it.  The Sports Illustrated reality show. 
[03:46:30]  I saw an episode.  I did.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They were taking photos on the beach.  Did you see Sabrina?  Yeah.  Were you in that one or had you been thrown out before?  No, that was the first episode.  I was still there, thankfully.  You were still there.  That was the first one?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  It was last Wednesday.  What were you doing on the beach?  Were you crawling around?  I did a little bit of crawling.  A little crawling.  I was in the bright orange swimsuit, the first one to go.  Right.  What did they tell you?  How did they critique you?  What did they say?  Well, I actually didn't have any negative comments.  No?  My comments were that I was too nice and too fair.  But I had... 
[03:47:00]  Oh, that's right.  Wait a minute.  It was supposed to be you were the one that was going to choose who was going to go first.  And then they thought strategically to get their photo shots done on the beach in their bikinis.  All right.  And strategically, it would have been good for you to go last.  And she got to pick the order of all the people that were going to take the photos.  And last would have been good because I guess there's not that pressure being the first one.  But you decided to go first?  Yeah.  I decided to just kind of set the tone for the day.  And just try to show the judges that I wasn't afraid that I didn't have to watch anybody. 
[03:47:30]  That I could just get out there and do my job no matter what position I was in.  And I don't think they saw it that way.  No.  No.  And they threw you off?  Too nice.  I got booted.  But at least you didn't get some of the criticisms the other girls got.  Oh, my God.  I did throw you off.  There was one girl.  Stop, Jimmy.  Jimmy, don't scratch your gut.  As you're asking a nice question.  What a despicable guy.  I'm being despicable.  I think she's very nice.  They shouldn't tell you if I'm being nice. 
[03:48:00]  Well, they told me that I was hardworking and I had an athletic body.  But that I was just too nice and too fair to make it in this industry.  That I wasn't tough enough.  Yeah, but you don't need to be nice to take a good photo.  No.  Exactly.  Who cares if you're a bitch?  They told one girl.  No, they're saying she is nice.  No, I know.  But who cares if you're a bitch or nice?  It's how you look in the photographs.  I'm thinking, right?  Well, I've been doing this for about seven years professionally.  And it has been my experience that the more professional and polite you are, the further you get.  So that's how I came into the show with that attitude. 
[03:48:30]  Who was the girl that they said had a flabby?  What did they say?  Her ass was flabby?  Now, this girl is like, she's a size 0-2 and weighs like 102 pounds or something.  So when they said that, I just was standing back there going, oh my God, they're going  to rip me to shreds.  I just know it.  That was brutal.  It was tough.  And I mean, she was working out every morning.  She ate right.  So I was blown away when they said that.  Well, they're just saying that because mean plays better on TV than nice.  If you're nice and pleasant, they're not going to get any sound clips or any of that stuff  out of you.  Stop, Jimmy. 
[03:49:00]  Why do you keep hitting your gut?  I'm actually nervous.  Well, it's just through the shirt, please.  That stupid hairless arm bugs me.  Yeah, it's true.  Yeah, Jimmy has-  No, no, no.  I don't want to show her.  It's embarrassing.  I have no hair on my arms.  Did any of the girls have hairy arms?  Not hairy, but kind of like peach fuzzy?  Not that I didn't really look at their arm hair.  Because it's almost like a girl's arm hair.  It's got wispy little-  Come on, show her.  I'm a guy and I have that as an arm hair.  It's such fine-  That's all that Harry's got.  It's kind of wispy.  Light hair.  Run your finger on his wispy hair. 
[03:49:30]  I actually think that would be better than having a sweater.  Love your-  So-  Yay, such an ass.  So, Anne, you've seen-  Yeah.  So you've seen that.  Very hot.  And like now, week to week, they run the girls through photo shoots.  Or what other things that the girls do to prove that they would be better models?  Well, the show is all about having the girl that has the right mental and physical components 
[03:50:00]  to make up the Sports Illustrated model.  And so they run the girls through physical challenges as well as modeling challenges.  Ah.  And the winner of the physical challenges gets advantages for the modeling ones.  That gag.  I love that one.  And what type of advantage?  It just depends.  What's an example?  Mine was actually-  I won the physical challenge, and so my advantage was to pick the order of the lineup.  Yeah.  That didn't seem like a really good advantage, though.  It's kind of like, eh.  They have challenges?  Physical challenges?  Yeah.  What was it?  Ours was basically a workout, Simon Says, death match, where- 
[03:50:30]  Simon Says.  Pretty much.  We were all doing push-ups and sit-ups and jumping jacks, and when he blew the whistle,  we had to follow whatever orders he was giving us, and so I was the last one standing.  And this was after about two hours of working out, and we had the hour-long challenge.  Oh, yeah.  So I was pretty much dead afterwards.  What?  Some kind of sick joke?  You're supposed to do that and then stop?  It's silly.  And then they actually, the winner will be in Sports Illustrated, will be on the cover, 
[03:51:00]  is it?  Not on the cover, but a seven-page layout in the swimsuit issue.  Seven-page layout in the swimsuit issue.  Wow.  How bummed are you that you're out?  You know what?  I'm actually, I was okay with it just because of the opportunity that was presented.  I mean, I'm here speaking with you guys this morning, and that wouldn't have happened  any other way.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  You really, believe me, looking at the TV and then coming here is really taking lemons  and making hepatitis.  But obviously, you model.  I mean, you did modeling before you got the show. 
[03:51:30]  How were you picked?  Did you have to send something in, or did they go around and say, hey, here's a purdy  girl?  Well, actually, one of my friends called me on a Saturday morning and just said, I heard  something about a million dollars in Sports Illustrated.  What are you doing today?  So we drove to Atlanta and went to the casting, and it just kind of rolled on from there.  A lot of people there?  Not at the one I was at, but I think, I went kind of early in the morning, so I think  it flooded that afternoon.  Yeah?  Yeah, I saw the video of the lines at some of the casting sets.  Did you look around and say, oh, that person doesn't have a shot?  Again, I have no idea what these people are ever looking for. 
[03:52:00]  Really?  So I just, normally when I go into a casting, I don't look like anybody else, or else I  look like everyone else.  So I just kind of roll with it and see what happens.  Can you imagine that line, though, with a bunch of women that look like her?  How amazing that must have been?  Like, you know, a hundred gorgeous women lining up.  Nice, tall, thin, lovely.  Beautiful.  That must have been nice.  What other modeling have you done?  Anything we know?  Well, I've done Cosmopolitan and 17YM.  I do a lot of runway, obviously.  I'm six feet tall, so I kind of work well on that.  You've got the nasty attitude on the runway.  I like the girls.  Oh, I love the attitude.  They make the nasty face look down like, oh, you don't have a shot in hell with me. 
[03:52:30]  I love that attitude.  Yeah, I've done runway for Nautica, Tommy Hilfiger, Gucci, Armani, Chanel, Baby Fact.  So, it's been really nice.  I've had a good time doing this.  Wow.  Well, very pretty girl.  Thank you.  And we wish you the best.  Any other future reality TV show plans?  You want to be with Mini-Me in a house watching pee or something?  Nothing like that?  Oh, as much fun as that.  I know I saw that episode. 
[03:53:00]  I got to hear you.  Wouldn't you love to be involved in that?  As much fun as that would be.  No, I would actually do another reality show if I was offered.  Yeah.  You had a good experience?  I had a really nice time.  It wasn't one of those things where a lot of people watch and go, oh, they edited this  down.  Well, obviously, there was extensive editing to get it down to an hour-long show.  Yeah.  Didn't make you look different than you were trying to present yourself or something.  Not really.  I was thankful with the way it came out.  Okay. 
[03:53:30]  Well, thank you for stopping by.  Thank you.  Are you working on any projects?  Anything you want to plug right now?  Actually, I am working on a website called 360flare.com.  Okay.  And it's a website for models and actors run by models and actors.  What?  Jimmy, you're the one.  I don't know.  Jimmy's just awful.  I actually was asking that very seriously.  360, the number 360, F-L-A-R-E.com.  F-L-A-R.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, we want to thank...  360flare.com.  We're running out of a show, unfortunately.  Yes, we are. 
[03:54:00]  But it was great.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  What are you doing, Eric?  Eric?  Studio shots.  Huh?  Studio shots.  All right.  Studio shots.  I want a picture with Sabrina.  Can we have a photo together?  Sure.  Okay.  Oh, she didn't blow you off.  Why would she?  She's a sweetheart.  She's very nice.  You guys are going to take a picture.  You guys are going to make the number 10.  Pinchy, what's up?  Wow.  You are so tall.  Jimmy's going to look... 
[03:54:30]  I'm just going to look how silly that looks.  Jimmy looks like Minnie.  Oh, you got him with that up on the website.  Jimmy looks like Minnie Mae.  Oh, that is awful.
