<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of a suggestive magazine photograph, transitioning into commentary on Rage Against the Machine's "Street Fighting Man" music video and criticisms of MTV's editing of the VMAs, specifically the removal of Triumph the Insult Dog's interaction with Jennifer Lopez.  The hosts then focused on the squalid state of their office, particularly Ben's cluttered desk, discovering a box of rotting, two-month-old food.  Jim Norton called in from the road, sharing a Christopher Reeve joke.  Listeners called to discuss Opie's alleged sports curse and shared personal anecdotes, including one listener's quitting smoking due to the show's influence, and another describing a disturbing experience at a cancer benefit.  The show then delved into a discussion of organ transplants (heart, arm, and larynx), leading to tangents about the Twilight Zone and Stephen King. This segment concluded with audio clips from "Retard Laverne and Shirley."

"Voice Box Monday" followed, sparked by a caller, Scott, detailing his throat cancer and voice box surgery.  This led to discussions of voice-related ailments and numerous prank calls targeting a bar with increasingly absurd and offensive names.  Roy recounted a humorous encounter with a voice box user, while Joe, a Vietnam veteran, claimed to have a technologically advanced voice box, launching into offensive and graphic war stories and racist remarks, met with disbelief and humorous reactions from the hosts and a refuting call from a speech therapist. Joe also mentioned seeing Jim Norton and Jeff Norris in a comedy show. Clips of intellectually challenged individuals conducting awkward VMA interviews were played, including those with Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Tommy Hilfiger.  The broadcast then moved on to a discussion of Michael Jackson's disorganized concert, featuring various celebrities, including a poorly received Marlon Brando segment, and played a recording of a deteriorated Buddy Epson singing. A Mighty Mouse-themed voice box recording was also featured.  Mario Cantone called in briefly to discuss his stand-up and the Emmys, and the hosts discussed a man showering in a visible apartment.  More prank calls and Michael Jackson concert discussion concluded this segment.

The next segment heavily featured discussion of Michael Jackson's alleged child molestation, with crass and offensive speculation from hosts and callers.  The hosts also discussed their strained relationship with the entertainment media.  Listener calls offered varied opinions on Jackson, often equally offensive. A significant portion discussed the death of Joan Rivers' dog, Spike, with graphic and darkly humorous commentary, including a contest for Spike's remains.  Calls included Mike (Online 7) referencing a New York Post article about Jackson’s party and Chris making a *Poltergeist* joke.  A caller discussed Blind Melon's *Behind the Music* episode, and a bizarre interview clip featuring Kimmy from *Survivor* and Pete Best was played, including an insensitive question about John Lennon's assassination. A caller discussed her grandmother's collection of cremated dog remains. The show included a rant by Opie about Al Dukes damaging a foosball table, and Logan recounted a "wow" story from a *Jay and Silent Bob* screening.  The segment concluded with offensive jokes about Jerry Lawler and a *Fast Times at Ridgemont High* trivia segment. Commercials for Vermont Teddy Bear Company and Paisano Restaurant aired.

The final segment featured Jim Norton as a guest.  Topics included a comedic bit mocking Montel Williams, a Hotwire.com commercial, an update on Jerry Lawler's personal life (specifically his divorce from Stacy "Kat"), and a listener's interrupted "wow" story from Philadelphia.  Opie delivered a highly offensive rant about women obtaining restraining orders, and numerous vulgar and misogynistic jokes about Lawler's ex-wife were made.  Excerpts from Lawler’s website updates detailing his heartbreak were read. The segment ended abruptly when a caller's story was interrupted, hinting at a connection to Lawler's ex-wife.  Hotwire and Ultimate V commercials aired.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  O.P. and for me  1027  E.A.W.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, what did I miss?  Why are you laughing, what?  Show me again.  I said that looks so warm.  Oh, doesn't it just look warm in there?  It sure does look warm in there.  Doesn't it?  It seems something's melting out of it already.  Looking at 10,000 salt. 
[00:00:30]  That guy's got hairy nostrils, too.  What's up with that?  Checking out the latest penthouse.  Nice, right, Steve?  Did you know I was talking about that picture, Steve?  I did. The second you said it, that's the one I was sniffing earlier.  That just looks warm and inviting.  That is exactly what one of these should look like.  Wow.  What pain.  It's very clean.  38 of October 2001's penthouse. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  All right, well, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  And there's no big schlongs in this spread.  Pure dyke love.  Uh, excuse me.  Yeah.  I was, uh, I was, uh, looking at that penthouse with Sandy this morning.  Yeah.  Huge C in that damn magazine.  No, I know, not in this spread, though.  Not in that one day out there, isn't it?  No, this one.  Look at this guy.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Where's the one where he's, uh, the girl's trying to get ready to service him. 
[00:01:30]  He's kind of hunched over, and his C comes up to his chest.  Up to his nipple.  Yeah.  His nippage.  Yeah, look at this.  Look at that.  All right, this is the O and A show.  A lot of people want to know what this song is.  I'm not telling you.  No, it's Rage Against the Machine.  What is it?  Street Fighting Man, right? 
[00:02:00]  The beginning of that?  Yeah, it's Street Fighting Man.  Yeah, right on.  All right.  A couple phone numbers to give you in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  And anywhere else, we would love to hear from you.  866-2774.  Wow.  Those guys just kind of lost their, um, rage.  The Rage Against the Machine?  Yeah, it was kind of all cool, and it was,  Freedom!  Yeah!  And then all of a sudden, it's like, you know,  what the hell do these guys got to be pissed about after selling a few million albums?  What do you think of the video?  I couldn't get my latte!  You know?  It's like, what the hell is he angry about now? 
[00:02:30]  His limo didn't come on time?  You know, kind of lost the Rage.  Did you see the VMAs with Will Ferrell?  Raging?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where he was doing a little, uh, little bit on, uh, last year's VMA?  Yeah.  And what's-his-name climbed?  And it went nowhere.  No.  Yeah, it just kind of went nowhere.  Hey, MTV, we've seen the VMAs.  Thank you.  Can you move on to new programming?  Well, they've got to wait for the next awards show.  Holy ass.  So they can play that a thousand times over again.  But all I want to do, I swear, is just see a video. 
[00:03:00]  Thank God for M2, man.  I don't get M2 in my area.  No.  You got that, um, what cable system are you on?  Viacom, right?  No, no.  Uh, uh, uh, what?  Cable Vision.  Cable Vision.  Sure.  Yeah.  That's our company here.  We don't get-  I have Time Warner.  I love it, by the way.  Thank you.  We don't get MTV2.  I was tuning in all weekend.  I just want to see some of these videos that are out.  I was so pissed off when I had, uh, Cable Vision.  I swear, you know, we got a few different cable systems, uh, here in New York. 
[00:03:30]  Like, I'm sure they do other places.  And you always meet the guy that, like, lives a couple of towns over and has the greatest  cable system ever.  And you have the crap.  Uh, you see, how many channels do you have?  How many channels do you have?  Uh, on my system?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like 80 or so?  80 or so.  I mean, I got a lot, but most of them are just nonsense.  I got like 400, or it was like 600 channels.  On your regular cable service.  This is it?  Yep.  Get the F out of here.  Every HBO, every Showtime, everything. 
[00:04:00]  It's- you can't even get that with, uh, with what you have.  But then I- I have all kinds of MTVs.  You know, there's all kinds of different MTVs, not just M2.  You want to watch video?  You want to watch Just Rock?  You want to watch rap?  You want to watch whatever?  There's different MTVs all for that.  And I turned on M2, and I'm just like-  Oh, it's a whole new world out there.  It really is a whole new world.  I was turning on M2, because MTV's just replaying the VMAs 20,000 times over.  VMA edition of fashion.  By the way, I want someone from MTV to call us and tell us why they got rid of the insult 
[00:04:30]  dog's comment on Jennifer Lopez.  Yep.  Yeah.  The version of the VMAs they're running over and over again at nauseam.  They got rid of the funniest line from the VMAs.  When the- what's the insult dog's name?  Triumph.  Triumph the insult dog.  Thank you.  In the hallway.  Where he's behind Jennifer Lopez and asks J-Lo if he could sniff her butt.  J-Lo.  But because she didn't have a sense of humor, did her people make MTV, you know- 
[00:05:00]  Absolutely.  Out of the man?  Absolutely.  And MTV, you know, they think J-Lo helps them out.  You know what I mean?  And they probably said, look, we're not going to do anything for MTV unless you pull that  with that slimy little puppet dog insulting J-Lo's ass.  And the insult dog is, you know, doing the Carson Daly stuff.  And then I'm like, look, here it is, the J-Lo thing.  This is hilarious.  And all of a sudden, they pop a graphic on.  So you can't see it.  Can't see the dog right next to J-Lo, and then there's a voiceover. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Like, you've got to be kidding me.  Which they put in during the original one after he had done the little insult to J-Lo.  Right.  But now they just kind of pushed it forward so it covers up any of J-Lo being insulted.  And what, they cut out the U2 screw-up?  Yeah, they cut that out.  They cleaned up all the awards.  Did they?  I mean-  Shortened everything up a little bit?  Well, they just cleaned up all the messes.  Tightened it up.  Tightened it up, as they say.  Tightened it up.  Yeah, they tightened it up.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, you've got to go with a satellite dish to the cable. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, there you go.  That's another thing.  You're right.  I'm actually looking into the satellite thing.  Finally.  So, thank you, Tom.  If you need it.  All right, bye.  Bye.  You know, we have to bring up the rotting food in our office.  Ugh.  How long have we been on in Chicago?  A couple months now?  Yeah.  Well, Chicago, as a, you know, as a welcome aboard type thing, sent us some local food from Chicago.  Ah, what, some deep dish pizza? 
[00:06:30]  All sorts of ribs and pizza and good food that you'd relate to Chicago.  Right.  And it was in this packaging.  Did we get any from Chicago's Sausage King?  I think we had some sausage from the Sausage King.  Oh, Abe Broman.  Abe Broman, wasn't that his name?  Yeah.  A Sausage King of Chicago.  We did get some fine sausage in there, yes.  And it was, they had some dry ice and stuff to keep it cool for a couple days, you know, 
[00:07:00]  in a nice styrofoam type thing.  Yeah.  So, we've got to explain, we have about seven people that hang out in our office.  It is like a dorm, like a, what's the, you know how you have the different rooms and then  you have the little central area with the TV and the couch?  It's like a dorm room without beds.  Right.  Really, because we all have our own computers and our own stuff on the walls and this and  that.  And I'm like, I'm always begging people to clean up their area because it gets so ridiculous.  I think you're what they call a fuss budget, you're the fuss budget, but I'm a slob. 
[00:07:30]  I really am a slob, but I'm not a slob.  The whole office is, we're all slobs in the office, but I don't think I'm as bad as most  of you guys.  No, you, you aren't.  You're, you're not even a slob.  I wouldn't consider you a slob.  He turns around today and he's like, Ben's away in Boston?  Okay, clean up the CDs on his desk.  Like, I wouldn't even dream, I wouldn't even think of that.  But he's got so much clutter on his desk that it was annoying you.  Well, because it's, Ant and I have like a big desk we share, all right, and then we 
[00:08:00]  both have our computers in this side of the office.  And then on the other side of the office, right down the row, it's Rick in his section,  Ben in his section, and right next to Ben, Stinky.  And bring Stinky in here, because he's not happy about Ben's section.  Because Ben's section, Ben's got, Ben's got the moving blob on his desk.  We could talk about him while he's alive.  Yeah, describe Ben's area in the office and how ridiculous it is.  And, and, and what he says when you try to, you know, get him to clean up his area.  First of all, you cannot see his countertop anymore. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  That went away a long time ago.  The, the paperwork is, am I exaggerating if I say six to eight inches?  It could be higher.  I think it's higher.  And wide, too.  Wide, piles of CDs.  It's like the blob, yes.  The blob.  It's spreading out.  It's slowly spreading to the side.  Hey, could I bring up an interesting point, though, here?  Yeah.  If we got rid of the printer that's the size of the Nimitz, maybe, maybe there'd be more room there.  There is a printer.  I swear to God, it looks like one of those big printers from the 80s. 
[00:09:00]  It is one of those big printers from the 80s.  Yeah, I've seen printers, very cheap these days, that you can get that is the size of a notebook.  It's nothing.  And for some reason, it's not even a fax printer, mind you.  This is a printer.  And it's gigantic, and it's ridiculous, and it takes up a lot of desk space.  Safe to say it's two feet high, at least.  At least two feet high, and probably two and a half feet wide.  It's a big old block.  It's huge, and it's got numbers on it from the various companies it's been abandoned from. 
[00:09:30]  You know, like you see IBM Section 3825, and then they wheeled it over to McDonald's Corp.  or something.  And we're like, it's the last whore copy machine that we get last ups on.  Right.  Just get rid of that.  So the office is just a mess.  We get stuff from all the cities on a daily basis.  We have so many shirts and CDs and bumper stickers.  We need the shirt for Syndicated Market Day, which is Wednesday.  Wednesday.  Like you guys know. 
[00:10:00]  Stinky participates every Wednesday.  It comes in with a new shirt from one of the new cities that we're broadcasting in.  And none of us do.  It's like, nice way to have some spirit, guys.  Wait.  I started Syndicated T-shirt Day, and then I felt like an idiot because I was coming in  with my KXOA shirt or my JFK shirt.  Yeah.  Actually, we don't like the JFK shirts.  Yeah.  They're boring.  They're white.  That was a problem.  We like the station, but their shirts suck.  They've got to do something about the shirts.  I like the YSP WOW shirts. 
[00:10:30]  I like the YSP shirt.  I like the KXOA shirt.  The BCN shirts.  The BCN shirts rock.  Yeah.  Our own WOW New York shirts are great.  But JFK, you know, no one really wants to wear that for Syndicated T-shirt Day.  I have to wear the Big Wazoo shirt.  The Big Wazoo is a little rough, too.  That T-shirt.  Yeah, it's a little rough.  But you know something?  So when I started...  Stinky takes it seriously.  Well, I started, and then Stinky kind of was like, you know, I thought he was just,  you know, making me feel good one day.  And then I finally gave up because it was just Stinky and I. 
[00:11:00]  And one day, we came in with the same shirt, and we looked like dorks.  Yeah, that was horrible.  They both came in with the black pants.  I came in that day with a syndicated shirt on, and no one even gave me the time of day.  No one noticed.  I didn't feel good about myself.  And now I don't even remember.  I think I had on...  You had an AEW shirt on.  No, I had an FM Talk shirt when this station used to be FM Talk for a week.  That doesn't count.  It doesn't count?  No, it's not part of the Syndicated T-shirt Network.  I thought I'd be funny.  I thought it was funny.  That doesn't count.  That's like wearing a missing person shirt, to tell you the truth, when you go to a concert. 
[00:11:30]  To tell you the truth, when I wake up Wednesday morning, the last thing I'm thinking is,  what syndicated shirt should I wear today?  The best was, though, when I walked in and I took one look at Stinky,  and we both had the KXOA shirts on.  I'm like, oh.  It took Stinky literally two seconds to get up from his desk  and go to the bathroom with the JFK T-shirt to change.  So anyway, the office is just such a mess at this point.  Ben's area is completely ridiculous. 
[00:12:00]  We finally gave Stinky his own little space in the office,  and it's just being taken over by Ben's junk, falling into his area.  You know what's great about my desk?  It's what they call a self-cleaning desk, like a self-cleaning oven.  But the more crap I get, everything else gets pushed to the back,  where there is a gap of about six inches, where everything just cascades down the back.  There's so much crap out there.  And then when it gets so bad that it starts falling out by my feet,  I pick it up and throw it in the garbage.  You know what, though?  Someone should go behind Anthony's desk and see what has made the floor. 
[00:12:30]  It would be really funny.  There's all kinds of crap.  I just look behind your desk, and there is a ton of crap there.  I'm afraid to clean it up because I might pull plugs out to things.  Go get one of the interns to grab all the stuff that's behind Anthony's desk,  you know what I mean, against the wall that fell in that slot.  Throw it in a big box and just bring it in.  They're already running together.  All right, so we're trying to clean up the office, especially because Ben's not around today.  And Rick, for once, got motivated, and he started looking around the office.  Slow down. 
[00:13:00]  Rick motivated.  Always cleaning up the desk.  Slow down.  So there's been a box near my desk for two months, okay?  And I remember distinctly asking either Ben or Rick,  do we need this?  And you're like, yeah, we need what's in that box.  Well, maybe, because I don't even saw that box today.  I think it was Ben.  And on top of it was a smaller box with, like, a bunch of CDs and stuff.  And I'm like, come on, can we get rid of this box?  What's in here?  He goes, no, we need it for the show.  We need it for the show.  So today, we opened her up. 
[00:13:30]  We opened up this box.  Oh, what waft out of this thing.  It was the food from Chicago a month ago.  Two months ago.  We're in September now.  Two-month-old food.  From Chicago.  Ant was playing a video game.  He wasn't even facing our direction.  Went, holy ass, what the F is that?  What is that?  And Opie's just flipping out.  Get it out of here.  Get it out of here.  Dude, there was a mixture of colors in there I had never seen before together, and they're still considered food.  Wasn't on the spectrum, man.  No.  Wasn't on the color spectrum. 
[00:14:00]  It looked like those little crystals that the kids put in water, and it grows those colorful rocks under the water.  That's the colors and the consistency that was growing on these food products.  A lot of different color molds and stuff, but still enough there to really stink really bad.  Oh, it's been stuck like a dead animal.  Yeah.  Well, that's what was in there.  It's not food at that point.  If you have sausage in a box for two months, it is just dead animal then.  It's no longer food.  It's roadkill.  Yee. 
[00:14:30]  So that's gone.  Thank God.  So.  It almost knocked us out, though.  And then the smell wafted down the hall.  It was just bad.  It was a bad scene.  But you're always, you're talking about cleaning up the office a little bit.  I'm trying to clean up.  Yeah, I see.  Because we share a really small space.  Opie's that guy.  No, I'm not.  You know that.  A little bit.  If you weren't, the place would be completely a mess.  I understand.  I understand.  You need the ying with the yang if I could please just use that.  Oh, party. 
[00:15:00]  Not without the party.  Let me tell you something.  My family's laughing right now because they know I'm a slob by nature.  Yeah.  But you guys are slobbier.  This is uber slob.  He is the slobbiist.  Oh, the worst.  The worst.  I don't know how he finds stuff.  He gets freaked out if you mess with his pile.  He goes, dude, I know where everything is.  Don't touch my desk.  And he does.  That's why you can't clean it up.  And you ask him where something is.  He goes, oh, it's right here.  And he goes down about four or five inches in his pile of crap and finds it through the  protective crust. 
[00:15:30]  His junk is 3D on his desk.  Right.  Yeah.  He has contest folders from like May.  Really?  At his desk.  It's like he never throws anything out.  Pack rat.  All right.  Let's go to Albert.  Albert, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Go, man.  This morning, I was listening to some radio station, and I heard on the news that J-Lo herself  said that she didn't want that comment that they had about a...  Triumph. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, with the dog.  Oh, she called herself.  She herself called and said it.  And why would MTV bow to that?  That was really funny.  God.  So when the Video Music Awards started, it was a goop show.  That's what they said.  It was a goop show.  Making fun of all the award shows, and now it has become everything it used to goof about.  That's why M2 rules.  You turn it on, you know what you're going to get?  Music videos.  You go to MTV, it's like the...  You don't see videos anymore. 
[00:16:30]  It's all the crap programming.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Let's go to Jim Norton, our buddy.  What's Norton up to?  Hey, Norton.  Hey, he's not down.  Jimmy.  There he is.  Hey, Jim.  Oh, it says...  Oh, it says Jim Norton off air.  Off air.  Jim, where are you?  I'm right now on my way into New York.  Oh, cool.  All right.  You're coming in?  Yeah, yeah.  I was just calling for Rick because I saw you guys last night and I didn't speak to him.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'll talk to him when I get in.  Hey, you want to hear a really good Christopher Reeve thing?  Yes. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Hold on.  I've got to find it.  I was reading an email before the show and this guy, Satchmo, writes, question for Anthony.  Ant, I remember you saying you stayed up late to watch Live from the Apollo on Saturday night.  Excuse me.  Great show.  Well, I'm up late and I just watched his black comic end his routine with a great Christopher  Reeve bit.  Just wondering if you saw it.  Basically, he said he was freaked out by the Chris Reeve commercial where he walked and  that it plays with people's minds.  And instead, he should be doing Snickers commercials.  Him in a wheelchair with a Snickers bar position just out of reach saying, not going anywhere 
[00:17:30]  for a while.  Grab a Snickers.  I heard that joke.  I don't know what comic does it.  It's very funny.  I forget who.  It's a black comic.  I don't remember who it is.  I love Live at the Apollo Saturday night.  You ever see when an artist, like I saw Joe, you know that guy Joe?  He was playing.  The crowd gets out of their chairs and runs toward the stage.  I swear to God, the artist must see exactly what Reginald Denny saw when he got out of 
[00:18:00]  that goddamn truck.  Nice.  And then this guy, Satchmo Norton, he quotes you.  It says, handicapped jokes, always funny.  They really are.  I got to tell you, especially with Christopher Reeves, because people just are so heartbroken  by that.  And so when somebody closes with it, you got to respect it.  Now, Norton, I must say last night, I saw you last night at Caroline's, despicable you're  at.  I have no other way to describe it.  Despicable.  You know, I didn't know you guys had stayed through the second show until I'm walking out. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  And I'm like, oh, well, that's it.  I thought you guys had taken off.  You are a horrible human being.  I really am.  I loved it.  I'm actually just going into Starbucks here.  Ma'am, can I have a medium coffee, please?  I just take coffee before I come in.  And I haven't taken a dump yet, either.  This is going to be an awful combination.  I just got a message from Rick when I woke up.  Go, thank you, ma'am.  Ma'am.  Oh, I will.  All right.  All right, we'll see you in a little bit, man.  All right, guys.  There you go. 
[00:19:00]  All right, bro.  There goes our buddy, Jim Norton.  Ben calling us from Boston, of all places.  Ben.  Ben.  Hey, I'm all the way in Boston.  You guys are busting my balls?  What are you talking about?  I heard it.  I know where everything is on my desk.  I can find anything.  See, this syndication thing is not working out too well.  Why?  Because we used to be able to talk to people about people.  Yeah, when they left the New York area.  It's like, you know, Ben's nowhere near New York, and he hears us messing with them.  You're messing with them?  Ben, remember that box that was right next to my desk for the last two months? 
[00:19:30]  There aren't just CDs in it.  No, there isn't.  I thought it was CDs.  The wrong box, dude.  Somewhere in the garbage was a box of CDs, because this was food from Chicago from two months ago.  You picked the best day to not be in the office.  When Rick lifted the lid of this box, holy ass.  Oh, and Ben loses his mind when stuff like that happens.  When Eddie comes in to take out the garbage, and he dumps over a pail where maybe some milk spills out, 
[00:20:00]  Ben loses his mind.  Oh, it's going to stink!  What do you mean maybe?  We get coffee every day before the show, and the leftover cream and the leftover milk  gets dumped right into the garbage pail that doesn't have a bag in it.  So it's just hanging out at the bottom of the pail until, you know, Eddie cleans our office.  All right, Ben.  All right, well, I can guarantee I know where everything is on that desk, and it's in some  sort of chaotic order that I like.  Well, Ben, you're going to...  I needed to defend myself. 
[00:20:30]  Ben, you're going to be a little surprised when you get back tomorrow.  Don't tell me you threw a bunch of my stuff away.  You're going to be a little surprised.  I hope he's like a freak.  He's going to throw everything out, and it's always, like, important stuff we need.  Ben, if you want to make, like, a little bit out of this, I will go in the office tomorrow,  and I will get at least 20 to 30 items, and I'm going to ask you personally why we need  this stupid thing in the office.  And watch.  Ben will have an answer for everything we want to throw out.  Oh, wait a second.  Rick will back me up.  A lot of that stuff we need. 
[00:21:00]  You always want to throw stuff away, and then someday we're going to need it, and we're  not going to have it.  Ben, perfect example.  You thought there were CDs in this box for the last two months.  It was rotting food with multicolored mold all over the place.  That's hilarious.  All right.  That's hilarious.  Ben's in Boston.  What does that mean, Dave?  Are they going to pull a gag on me?  Hey, Dave, batting down the hatches.  Ben's in Boston.  Dude, I was out Saturday night, and I ran into an old college friend of mine who happens 
[00:21:30]  to be friends with him, and he is petrified.  Rock hole?  Petrified.  He doesn't know what to do with us.  Yeah, I know.  Freaked out, and they did cancel all his appearances for the month and all that stuff.  Yeah, they canceled.  Look at this.  This is Rock hole from WAAF, the station.  We used to work out at Boston.  We now work at BCN, obviously, WBCN up in Boston, and we have a hatred for WAAF and  for Rock hole, Rocco Schlocko, who does the afternoon show over there.  Took our place, didn't call, didn't do anything. 
[00:22:00]  No, hey, thanks for the shift, guys, or sorry to hear you got fired.  Best of luck, nothing.  So he has appearances.  You know, these jocks, they go out and, you know, appear at a concert or a tweeter or something  like that and give away some CDs, meet the fans or something.  And the last one was a blood drive.  A couple of people from the fans of this show went over there and disrupted Rock hole a little  bit.  I do believe they went to say hi.  Went to say hi.  Got the F word on the air a few times. 
[00:22:30]  Went to say hi.  Upset Schlocko and Maddie, his partner over there at AF.  And now it seems Rocco's appearance has taken off the calendar.  He's scared S-less.  I hear that when he goes out, he's got at least six people with him at any given time because  he's petrified.  That's true.  He's going out with big policies.  And this guy, who is a close friend of mine that I haven't seen, who is friends with him,  just said he's so fearful.  He has no idea what to do with us.  He's hiding like a little worm. 
[00:23:00]  Now I hear there's nothing he could do.  This is what we do.  We do this better than anyone.  I hear our army's in place up there now.  Next Sunday, they're doing some concert with a bunch of second rate type bands.  You know, some cool bands, but it's nothing like the shows that BCM puts on.  Please.  At Foxborough.  But how's Rocco going to handle that?  How's he going to go out in public, not knowing who's there, what they're going to do,  and deal and do his job? 
[00:23:30]  I don't know how he's going to do it.  Well, our next surprise is on the way, by the way.  Hey, I'm the fat ass in the plastic bubble.  Don't touch me.  They're going to wheel him out in a big bubble.  So we can't get to him.  Our next little surprise on the way.  Have fun when you hit that stage, fat man.  Watch out for the jackal.  You're going to love this, man.  Beware of the jackal.  Hey, shut up.  Fear the jackal.  Dave.  Dave, what do I do? 
[00:24:00]  Fear the jackal.  All right.  All right, Ben.  One other Boston note for everyone.  You guys have to see this wow sign on the back of BCN.  You can see it all the way from the end of Lansdowne Street, which is a pretty big distance.  It's unbelievable how far away you can see this thing.  I saw it last night.  I drove by to see it last night.  Unbelievable.  Nice.  Very cool.  Thank you, Ben.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow, all right?  All right.  All right, man.  There he goes, Ben.  Maybe I'll go out in disguise. 
[00:24:30]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Opa.  Bad news, man.  Your curse continues, and it only gets worse.  Huh.  Your fourth curse.  Every team that you're in the market for now, either lost or didn't cover yesterday.  I have a new fundraiser, and I'll spend all the money for my bookie next week after we cash in.  Wait, wait.  Give me the sports pitch.  And explain the Opie sports curse.  It's Opie.  It's beyond ridiculous at this point.  Opie is the worst sports jinx ever. 
[00:25:00]  The worst.  If he picks a team, it doesn't matter how well the team is doing.  If he picks the team to win, they will definitely lose.  No questions asked.  If he backs a team on a whim, that's it.  They're not winning.  If he's a fan, they have no hope whatsoever.  Getting to a championship, nothing.  He is a jinx.  Has been, always will be.  It's almost scary.  Wait, Mike.  You know, Mike, hold on.  Hold on the phone. 
[00:25:30]  I want to see if you're right, okay?  I'm going to be off by one or two, but let me go through the ones I know.  No, no, no.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I'm going to go right down the list, okay?  You go.  All right.  We are syndicated to Chicago.  Chicago.  Loser.  Ravens 17, Bears 6.  Let me keep going down here.  We are syndicated to Dallas.  Bucks 10, Cowboys 6.  We are syndicated to Buffalo.  Saints 24, Bills 6.  We are syndicated to Boston. 
[00:26:00]  Bengals 23, Patriots 17.  Look at that.  We're syndicated to Cleveland.  Seahawks 9, Browns 6.  Oh, my God.  You've got to be kidding me.  I'm sorry to kill you, but you're going to make me a lot of money this year.  We are syndicated to San Francisco, but barely on a tiny little AM that only goes about two  miles in radius, so I don't know if it counts that the 49ers beat the Falcons 16 to 15.  Oh, they didn't cover, though.  They didn't cover, yeah.  Well, we are syndicated to Philadelphia.  Rams 20, Eagles 17, and OT. 
[00:26:30]  And, of course, for everyone listening to us on WJFK, Chargers 30, Redskins 3.  Dude, this is just...  It's about your Jets.  And, of course, the Jets.  And, of course, the Jets lost to the Colts 45 to 24.  Oh, my God.  Mike, best observation of the day right there.  Thank you, my brother.  Not one team covered yesterday.  You suck.  Have a great day, guys.  All right, Mike.  Peace.  That is funny. 
[00:27:00]  What a fortune you would have made if you just bet against every city that we're in because  of Opie's sports curse.  God damn.  Isn't that amazing?  That is.  Who would have had the foresight to think to do that?  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Opie.  Hey.  Have you been an Islander fan since 1983?  No.  Well, you know, they haven't won since 1983.  No, I know that.  I actually was brought up an Islander fan.  That is the truth.  You could ask anyone in my family.  So you got to live through their glory years.  Yeah, and it's been pretty pathetic the last 18 or 19. 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  Well, let's hope you don't become a Ranger fan.  Hey, I got season tickets for the Islanders, though.  So there you go.  We're going to have a great year this year.  I hope so.  I hope he's sitting through the Islanders championship listening to the new album by The Knack.  Deb the Dyke, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Deb.  Hey, I just wanted to check with you, Opie.  Are you rooting for the Giants tonight?  I hate the Giants.  Oh, come on.  You got to root for the Giants.  I'm a big Broncos fan.  They're a shoe-in. 
[00:28:00]  I really hate the Giants.  Never like the Giants.  Oh, come on.  I need my Broncos to win tonight.  Could care less about the Giants.  Well, then, you know something, Deb?  I'm sorry to say, the Broncos will lose tonight.  Oh, I don't know.  New Stadium tonight?  Open it up?  They will lose.  All right.  I'll call you tomorrow.  We'll see you, Ann.  All right, Deb.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Deb the Dyke.  Bye.  Hey, that's pretty funny.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Didn't Opie pick that team in the movie Alive to win the World Cup?  They had to eat each other in the plane. 
[00:28:30]  No, these guys are great.  Great soccer players.  They're a shoe-in.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Did you notice the first three teams that you got, what was their score?  The losing side.  They all got six points.  Right.  That means 6-6-6.  You're the devil.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  Over and up.  All right.  You suck, man.  Isn't that amazing, though?  What are the odds?  All right.  We should take another break, I guess. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, you know what we should do?  We got that sheet, so I know what to play?  Seat.  The email on the Retard Laverne Shirley at the VMAs, just off the hook.  Unbelievable how many people enjoyed them interviewing the celebrities or attempted to interview the  celebrities as they made their way into the awards.  So all this week, as we go to break, I think we're going to play some of the better ones,  okay?  All right.  Which one do you want to hear?  I like Bon Jovi.  Yeah, let's start with Bon Jovi. 
[00:29:30]  All right?  So listen to this.  This is the Retard Laverne Shirley on the red carpet interviewing everyone, going into  the VMAs.  And this is how it sounded like when they were trying to talk to Bon Jovi.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  We love you, Richie!  Richie!  We love you, Richie!  Richie!  We love you!  Richie!  Oh my God!  We love you guys!  And a half-life air!  All living on a prayer!  It's my life! 
[00:30:00]  It's my life!  Watch out, watch out!  It's my life!  It's now or never!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.

The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station. 
[00:31:30]  1027 WNEW, New York.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I rocked.  Disturbed.  Goddamn.  Are you down with the sickness?  I want to get it.  What do you got in?  People give me a little grief about your sports jinx, Opie. 
[00:32:00]  Seems every city that we broadcast in now, their sports teams, their football teams lost in week one.  In week one.  Yeah.  Every one of them.  Either lost or just won, didn't cover the spread.  The 49ers.  Yeah.  The Niners.  So, a lot of people have their own little comments they want to make to you.  Opie, you should pick my fantasy football starters for me so I can bench them and win.  Did Opie root for Mr. T in Rocky III?  I bet Opie was a fan of Corey Stringer. 
[00:32:30]  Ouch.  What's more troublesome, troubling the replacement refs or the Opie curse in the NFL?  Well, I said the Opie curse, by the looks of it, proven damaging.  Hey, Opie, please never become a St. Louis Rams fan.  Keep hating the Yankees.  I'll have a great year.  And finally, Opie, do you still have your Len Bias jersey?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:33:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey, Paul, what's going on today?  Not a whole lot, man.  All right, you tell us.  Well, I just wanted to let you guys know, man, I recall when you guys had that blind boxing match with Blind Dave.  Blind Dave and Blind Matt, right.  Yeah.  Well, I recall that you guys were complaining about him smoking and stuff.  I recall.  He couldn't breathe because he was smoking all the time.  Well, I just wanted to let you guys know that you kind of encouraged me to quit smoking because I used to smoke. 
[00:33:30]  I just quit smoking for about three weeks now.  You quit smoking because of Blind Dave in that show?  Yeah, you guys encouraged me because I got tired of breathing really hard in the humidity and stuff, you know, and I just figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm doing it, man.  Well, congratulations.  Do you think we care?  I have a sensitive Opie.  Well, you know, I just wanted to let you guys know that, man.  Call Oprah.  You guys rule, man.  All right.  Thanks, Paul.  Thanks.  Bye. 
[00:34:00]  Good.  Now walk out in front of a bus.  Just want to let you know I quit smoking because of you guys.  Thank you.  Let's give them a big hand.  You're an inspiration.  Fantastic.  Wonderful.  All right.  You know what?  We should get into the sickest story of the day.  Just get it out of the way because it's creeping me out, and I don't want it just sitting here for the next few hours.  So we'll deal with this, and we'll move right on to other fun things, okay?  Does this fall into the medical technology gone crazy category? 
[00:34:30]  Science has got to just slow down.  Slow down a little bit.  They've got to just slow down a bit.  We've talked about the heart transplants, and then the guy recently that doesn't even have a heart, a real heart in his body, and he's living no problem.  He's got a mechanical heart, all self-contained.  Sounds like Richard Pryor, the guy who was supposed to last, what, 24 hours with this mechanical heart, and he's doing great two, three months later.  Yeah.  All right.  A little humming going on in his chest. 
[00:35:00]  He doesn't even have a heartbeat.  Let's not forget the guy.  I think he was from the Jersey area with the arm transplant that he finally had to get removed because it freaked him out.  He got it cut off again.  Thank God.  And the drugs that he had to take so his own body wouldn't reject the new arm was screwing him up, so he just said, screw it, hack it off.  You know the deal, though?  They took some dead guy arm.  Dead guy arm.  And they put it on this guy, and the hair and the skin tone wasn't the same. 
[00:35:30]  I know.  And he ends up throwing out the first pitch at a game.  Yeah, that was weird.  Oh.  It was just a different hand.  And then there's all the ramifications of, you know, does it make you a little gay if you go and spank out a batch with another man's hand?  It's another guy's hand.  Another guy's hand.  Right.  Sure.  You know?  And that poor guy dies.  He leaves his body to science or medicine or whatever.  He doesn't know that his arm is going to be sewn on some other guy that's going to be wiping his crack and spanking out a batch or something. 
[00:36:00]  And, you know, the poor guy's got to look down at his arm down there and go, oh, great.  That arm, I used that arm to touch my mom's face.  I used that arm in life to, you know, run it through my best girl's hair.  Touch maybe, pat my little kid on the head or something like that.  And there it is.  Six inches of man meat.  Wrapped around.  It's wrapped around it now.  And I've got to interrupt you, Rand, because we've inspired another person through this show. 
[00:36:30]  Casey, yes.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to let you know you've inspired me so much I've started shooting up heroin now.  You know?  Oh, yeah?  But I had a problem the first time I used a plastic spoon, but I got it all worked out, so I'm doing good.  Well, I'm glad to hear that, Casey.  We inspire everyone.  Thank you.  Yeah, you guys suck.  All right, bye.  Later.  Casey's shooting heroin because I want to have some heroin.  That's cool.  Nice.  Anyway, so, you know, it sounds all well and fine. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, arm transplant.  But then when you just think about it, how did that story go, though?  He really got freaked out and they had to lop it off?  He got a little freaked out.  He said he was...  Because he had it for a while, right?  Yeah, he said the skin started getting very dry and...  Oh, it was dead.  It was dead man hand.  Hello.  And the medication that he had to take to keep from rejecting it was causing all kinds of other problems.  So, he just said, you know, I went that long without an arm.  Just take it off. 
[00:37:30]  So, the arm was, I guess, returned back to the great beyond where it belonged.  Where do you put the arm after someone else uses it?  Do you return it to the first guy?  Do you bury it?  Do you return it to the first guy?  Do you give it to someone else?  Imagine they just pass it on to someone else.  That's creepy.  Well, I'd want a woman's hand and arm.  Nice, right?  Soft.  You spank one out there.  Fag.  It's a girl.  No.  You spank it out.  It's a girl's hand.  Looks cool when you're spanking. 
[00:38:00]  He looks real cool.  It looks like a fag.  Why has the guy got long fingernails and nail polish on his hand?  You could put on a glove, perhaps, or maybe just not go with the long nails.  I don't think you thought it out before you decided to say that on the radio, Anthony.  See, and that's what I'm saying.  People aren't thinking through this.  There I am.  All of a sudden, I got a chick's hand, and I'm feeling stupid when I really think about it.  You're right.  No, but medical technology's really gone crazy.  All right.  The heart, the arm guy, and now... 
[00:38:30]  Hold on to your hats, kids.  Larynx transplant gives man new voice.  Oh.  Larynx.  Larynx.  How do you say that word?  Voice box.  Voice box transplant.  Thank you.  That guy got a new voice box.  Let me read this.  It's really a...  I like how he lost his old one.  Yeah.  There's a lot of good things in this.  What's his name?  Quick little story.  Wile E. Coyote?  Was it an Acme wire?  A Pennsylvania man who had the world's only voice box transplant has regained full vocal 
[00:39:00]  range and speaks with an entirely new voice.  Ah!  Oh.  Tell me he's speaking like the dead guy that he got the voice box from.  He has to talk like the dead guy.  He has the dead guy voice.  All right.  So he's got the new voice.  Tim Heidler, 44, has even retained the accent he had before he lost his voice box in a motorcycle  accident 22 years ago. 
[00:39:30]  So he's got the new voice, but he put an accent on it.  He still has his old accent.  He's got his old accent.  Right.  What we are now seeing is truly amazing beyond my wildest imagination, said Dr. Marshall Strom,  whose team at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio performed the surgery three years ago.  Heidler lost the power of speech when he rode his motorbike into a wire stretched across  a road.  Oh!  Ha ha ha!  Oh!  Ha ha ha!  Oh, God. 
[00:40:00]  Could you imagine that?  Man, man, man, man, man, man, man.  Oh.  Just into a wire.  The Pennsylvania man then spent the next 19 years being able to speak only through a  handheld electronic device.  The voice, uh...  Oh, my God.  What the hell am I?  The coyote or something?  Who stretched that goddamn wire across the road?  Oh, they do the burp thing.  You ever see the burp talk?  You ever see the people with the throat cancer?  The throat cancer.  That, uh, they have the hole in the throat and they use burping to talk? 
[00:40:30]  The burp?  Dude, you've never seen this?  I haven't seen the burp talk, though.  It's burp talk.  They suck air in.  Screw that.  And talk burping.  Yeah, well, that was...  Give me a pen and a pen.  No, this was before really everyone had the availability of the electronic, the cancer  kazoo.  I was smoking for 37 years and they took my boy's box.  Please don't smoke.  Yeah.  How does the burping thing work?  They suck in air. 
[00:41:00]  They go, uh, and it's disgusting.  It's so disgusting.  And there's like this yellow pussy crap dripping from their blowhole in their throat and they're  burping and talking.  Oh, it's so sick.  I remember that as a kid.  Because not everyone had the cancer kazoo.  Those cancer kazoo's were like big things back then because they didn't have the transistor  technology they do today.  There was a guy in my family.  Big tubes.  And through divorce, thank God, he stopped showing up at the family functions. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Think I'm kidding?  Through divorce.  Thank God because you had to deal with them.  Hey, man, when people get divorced in your family, not only do you lose the annoying  relative, you lose all their family members too.  Good riddance.  See you all later.  Bye-bye.  So this guy would come to like a granny's house for all the holidays, Thanksgiving and  Christmas.  Yeah.  He had the throat cancer.  He didn't have the cancer kazoo.  He had the hole with the little plastic thing right there. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  They pop a nice little, like an eyelet in your shoe.  You know where you lace your shoes up?  They pop a little plastic thing in there to keep the edges from getting ready.  Maybe he had some wacky little voice thing going.  What did he do?  Maybe it was the burp speech.  I don't know.  It wasn't very clear, but he could get some words out.  See, that's probably part of the burp speech.  Probably was, now that you think about it.  And this is what horrified us as kids.  Guy smoking through his neck.  Oh, he was smoking through his throat?  Even though the cigarettes, without a doubt, was the reason why he lost it all. 
[00:42:30]  Well, if you lose your voice, Bob.  Smoking cigarettes through your neck.  You might as well just keep smoking.  You might as well.  That's like, you know, I think my grandfather died of lung cancer.  You know?  And he smoked a lot of cigarettes.  And then they took one lung out.  Keep smoking.  Enjoy your last few years.  It's not like, all right, you had lung cancer.  They hacked the whole lung out.  Hey, you're good for another 50.  You know what I mean?  Right.  You're pretty much done.  So just keep smoking. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  The rest of the story, Anthony?  Yeah.  All right.  So this guy loses his own voice box.  He's got dead guy voice box.  Dead guy voice box.  The Pennsylvania man then spent the next 19 years being able to speak only through a handheld electronic device.  Okay.  That was after his motorcycle accident.  After the operation, Heedler's own nerves grew into the transplanted tissue, and the donated voice box shrunk to fit its new body.  Oof.  This guy has a brand new voice that probably sounds like the dead guy. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Imagine calling up that guy's mom.  Mom, I'm alive.  I was just kidding.  It was just a big joke.  Mom, the storm blew the phone wire over my tombstone.  And I'm able to talk to you.  Remember that?  Twilight Zone?  Yeah.  Who was it?  It was, I think it was the kid that played, it was Bill Moomey. 
[00:44:00]  Bill Moomey from Lost in Space?  Yeah.  And he had a relationship with his grandmother, and his grandmother died, but his grandmother had given him this little toy phone.  And one night it starts ringing, and he's talking, like he's talking to someone on the other end.  And the parents are, like, freaking out, like, what's this kid doing?  He's holding a conversation, and he's saying it's grandma.  You're just gaming the creeps, man.  Yeah.  And it turned out that a storm blew the phone line down, and it landed on grandma's tombstone.  And he was able to talk to her. 
[00:44:30]  Dead grandma.  And then the father had to get on the phone with the mother and say, leave our son alone.  Because the grandma was trying to get him to kill himself so she could be with him.  Rock.  Goddamn Twilight Zone.  Always good.  All right.  So there you go.  The guy has dead guy voice boxing, can now speak like the dead guy.  Yeah.  Brian.  I was a waiter at a catering place, and they had a cancer benefit one night.  I had an entire table of people with voice boxes I had to take the orders from. 
[00:45:00]  Really?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  I couldn't sleep for two days.  I was, like, 18 years old.  Hey, let's do Voice Box Monday.  There's got to be someone out there that has a voice box.  Where were we just?  Hopefully someone out there has a sense of humor with a voice box.  Call the show today.  Call the show today with your cancer gazoon.  Voice Box Monday.  Hey, it's Voice Box Monday, everybody.  I'm the Opie and Anthony Show.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  I'm-O-N-A. 
[00:45:30]  Why not?  Voice Box Monday.  God, that's a bitch.  Guarantee we'll get at least one.  That one is a bitch, man.  You hear the story, Norton?  Norton just arrives.  Not?  Oh, yeah.  On the way in, I was listening about the transplant.  The Voice Box.  There was another guy.  You know, they're doing a lot of stuff with eyeballs now, too.  They put dead people's eyeballs in part of your eyeball, and then you could see again.  Yeah, the cornea transplant, right? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, things like that.  Even more so.  They're doing stuff with the retina now.  It's like, it's ridiculous.  I think what happened is they pretty much gave up on the major diseases.  After so many years of money, they just said, ah, you know, cancer's something we're just all going to have to deal with.  There are better ways to treat it now, but it's not like there's a vaccine or something.  You know, the AIDS, I think it's the same thing.  They got great ways to treat it, but no pill that you're going to be able to take and go back to butt banging.  You know, so they went on to these other things, like this cloning. 
[00:46:30]  God damn, what about that family that had a child that died?  They kept a piece of the kid's tissue in the refrigerator, and they're paying scientists to clone their kid so they can have their kid back.  Cloning dead children.  That's twisted.  And the family's spending all kinds of money to try to get their kid cloned.  Move on.  It's Pet Sematary.  You ever see that?  With the little kid?  Daddy.  Daddy.  Daddy.  Gage. 
[00:47:00]  Little Gage.  And he comes at the bottom with the scissors and stuff.  And then father punches him right in the face.  Stephen King rolls, man.  Not fair.  Not fair.  The kid goes running away.  He ruled.  He ruled until he got ran over by that damn car.  No, he's good now, too.  I messed him up.  One thing Stephen King always did that I admire, I don't care how crappy his movies translate from the book,  the kid doesn't care about children and old people getting killed in the worst possible ways.  He'll do it. 
[00:47:30]  He don't care.  I love that.  You ever read It about the clown that was murdering children?  It's phenomenal.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  The movie wasn't that bad, either.  It was creepy, though, the clown.  They're never as good as the book.  Hey, Keith, what's up?  Hey, I was just thinking about the dead guy voice box.  I'm a real prick.  I'd be using all kinds of pranks.  I'd be calling the widow up to me.  Call the guy's old job.  Call his credit card company.  Hey, how come you canceled all my cards? 
[00:48:00]  There's limitless possibilities you could do with this.  Yeah.  I don't want dead guy's voice box.  No, thank you.  Dead guy's anything.  I don't want dead guy's anything.  You know the junk transplant is just, we're just years away from that, maybe.  Why not?  You lose your junk in some kind of horrible accident, and you still want to be a man, go  around doing some of that banging, and then some guy dies, you get dead guy junk.  Can we get a black guy's?  Sew it right on, right?  There's going to be an overstock of Asian junk that nobody wants. 
[00:48:30]  No one wants.  It's like the Yugo car, you know?  No one wants that piece of crap.  Say a little.  Hey, Bob, what's up?  Hey, you guys get the Twilight Zone episodes mixed up.  Oh, yeah, the one with the phone line on the coffin was the woman.  Yeah, they had the one with Billy Movey, you know, the grandmother talking the phone.  She made him, like, jump in a pool or something.  I was going to say that, because I just saw that episode recently.  The phone line was the only one.  The one with the phone line over the grave was, it was like the old lady's husband, and she 
[00:49:00]  didn't know who was calling.  She thought it was a crank call, and it was kind of a funny ending, because at the end,  she kept telling him, don't call back, don't call back.  Finally, when she figured out what it was, she picked up the phone, and the guy's like,  Oh, I always listened to you.  I always listened to you.  The guy died, I guess, because, I don't know, she caused a car accident or something.  It was her dead husband or boyfriend or whatever it was.  Yeah.  And she's laying in bed, and the phone kept ringing and ringing, and she's answering it, 
[00:49:30]  and it's like, hello, hello, hello, all creepy and stuff, and she was like, go away, leave  me alone, don't talk to me anymore, and she kept doing this over and over again, and finally  the guy just said, she just said, okay, I always listen to you.  I won't call you back, and at this point, she realized who it was, and she's like, no,  please talk to me.  I always listen to you.  Oh, my God.  Those shows rock.  Those rock.  All right, Bob, thank you.  All right, thanks.  Okay, those are out on DVD now. 
[00:50:00]  I think Chris is a little pissed at us.  Chris?  Hey, Chris.  Yo.  What's up?  All right, man.  Hey.  I got to talk about something.  Yeah.  What you're saying to these people, this ain't cool.  What?  All right, now, I understand that, yeah, yeah, yeah, some of these people, they don't need  that, but the liver, the arm, and the liver, they need that crap.  Oh, the organs?  No, organs are cool.  They're inside.  You don't pay them no mind.  Right.  Someone wants to donate a kidney or something like that?  Hey.  No, we understand all that.  We understand that transplant. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Dead guy hand.  Yeah.  Dead guy hand.  He took my name also, dude.  We understand organ transplants.  Yeah.  It's very, very important.  We understand that.  But when it starts getting to, like, dead guy's arm and dead guy's voice box, it's creeping  me out.  But I guess, you know, the dead guy arm thing, you guys are listening to think you can commit  a lot of crimes, and his fingerprints are going to show up on a crime scene.  That's the beauty of it.  Yeah.  And then they'll say, hmm, where did that arm go?  Oh, yeah.  We sold it on another guy.  Good point.  I don't think that would work too well. 
[00:51:00]  Let's go to Scott.  Scott, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Whoa.  Voice box Monday, baby!  What's up?  Hey, don't make fun, okay?  We're not making fun.  We think it's cool.  Oh, thank you.  But, yeah, I spoke to you guys a couple of months ago.  You put me on the air.  I was making believe I was Jack Krugman, but...  Hey, Scott.  Scott.  Yeah, what do you want to know?  Could you page somebody alcoholic?  Ha, ha, ha.  I wish I would be able to drink, but after they removed half my voice box and one vocal 
[00:51:30]  cord...  Stanley Payne?  They said that I'm not allowed to drink alcohol.  Sally, drummer.  I'm organic.  Really?  What?  What happened to your voice box?  You lost it to cancer, right?  Yeah, five years ago, I was diagnosed with a small tumor on my right vocal cord, and  the entire world told me that with radiation, I'll be cured forever, but they didn't tell  me that one teeny little percent causes... the radiation causes a secondary tumor.  Oh, my God. 
[00:52:00]  They tell you that five years is the clear point, and summer, which was one and a half  years later, I got another tumor.  So this time, they removed half my voice box and one vocal cord.  Sucks.  But you know what?  Thank God.  I'm in sales, and I'm still able to sell, and I make a good living.  Right on.  Hey, Scott, does it hurt as much as it sounds?  Not at all.  The only thing that's the weirdest thing is every three months, when I go to my doctorate,  Sloan Kettering, I sit in front of this incredible cancer hospital, and every single nurse and 
[00:52:30]  doctor is sitting there with cigarettes in their mouth.  Oh, right.  Isn't that amazing?  They work with people all day.  It's a cancer hospital.  Probably the best one in the whole country.  And they sit there, and all the doctors and nurses are smoking?  Yep.  That's amazing.  Pretty crazy.  Well, got to keep the money going into the medical industry by getting cancer, I guess.  Yeah, but that was one big thing that I was really afraid of, was having my entire voice 
[00:53:00]  box removed, because there was a good chance of, you know, thank God, what in, you know,  stage one, which they caught it early enough.  Yeah, wow.  Well, God bless you there, as they say.  God bless you.  Thanks.  You only lost one.  I don't know.  One vocal cord.  It's like flying on a 767, though, and one engine goes down.  Hey, it's perfectly fine.  We can fly with one.  We can land this sucker.  Exactly.  But you're watching that one real hard, real close.  I'm not kidding.  Every time I get a little bit of a cold, you know, right away, you think it's something, 
[00:53:30]  you know.  It's crazy.  At that point, Anthony, you want the window seat.  Ladies and gentlemen, we've had a problem in the engine number one, but this plane is  fully equipped on landing and flying with just one engine.  It's that one on the right that everyone's going to be looking on.  I'm looking at every gauge.  I look at every single little light on this engine.  Oh, my God.  Was that a red light?  Oh, no, no.  Okay.  Everything's fine.  It's one engine.  Just one.  Second.  For flying.  All right.  Well, Scott, thanks. 
[00:54:00]  Call us from time to time.  I absolutely would.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right, man.  Yeah.  Scott.  Yeah.  Was it from smoking?  Believe it or not, that's the sickest thing.  I think I smoke.  I'm 42.  When I was a kid, maybe for two years, 18 to 20, I smoked.  But all in all, I'm in pretty good health.  I work out.  I eat right.  It's the sickest thing.  Everywhere I turn now, all I keep hearing is cancer.  Cancer, cancer.  Somebody's got it here.  There.  It's nuts.  All right. 
[00:54:30]  Thank you.  Really picking up our spirits for the show here.  Oh, come on.  The last time you said that, too, it's just, it's reality.  The only thing that stinks is every time.  I mean, literally, you know, I'm in sales all day long.  And it's not a day that goes by that four times a day somebody will say to me, at McDonald's  somewhere, you know, whenever I stop, somebody will say, oh, you should be in bed.  You know, you have a lot of diabetes.  You sound sick.  Right.  Oh, you shouldn't be out. 
[00:55:00]  You know.  Hey, Scott.  Every single day, I'm reminded of the voice.  Let's keep on talking until he loses his voice.  Paul.  Hey, Scott.  What's worse, having cancer or being in sales?  That's true.  It's amazing, though.  Thank God I'm able to communicate.  That's the only thing.  All right, man.  All right, guys.  I would love to hear Scott imitate Rob Halford.  Oh, man.  Trying to do like Brewer does, right?  Hey, listen, guys.  I love you.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  See ya. 
[00:55:30]  Wow.  You know, I actually, it's funny.  Go, go, Jim.  I'm sorry.  That's right.  They used to have comedians come into Sloan Kettering sometimes just for the patients.  It was like a perfect gig.  You would go in and just perform for them.  And I'm in there one night, and I'm bombing horribly because I'm trying not to be a complete  dirtbag because they're all cancer patients.  And that's your act.  Yeah, I'm starving.  Being a complete dirt.  And so I'm really bombing, and this one guy is sitting up front, hooked up to Tubes.  I'm like, I know.  You hate me.  I suck.  And after the show, he comes up and he goes, oh, I enjoyed you.  I'm just not feeling that well. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, God.  That's how nice my act is.  I made a guy want to kick the plug in the arm on himself.  I wanted to smile, but they've removed the muscles in my face that make me smile.  All right.  Great.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, horrific.  Anthony, I found alcoholic.  Yeah, because the second we started talking to Scott, it sounded like the guy that used  to do the, well, they made prank calls to that bar, tube bar.  Right.  And the guy that would answer, the bartender, it sounded just like him.  Right, and here it is. 
[00:56:30]  This is a classic.  Oh, hello.  Hello.  Is Al there?  Al, uh, Al Winger?  No.  Coholic.  Al who?  Coholic.  Alcoholic.  It's not a whole of shit.  Alcoholic.  You don't know anybody by that name.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Hello.  Hello.  Yes.  This is a tube bar?  Yeah.  Yeah, I wonder if you could help me.  I'm looking for Phil Myers. 
[00:57:00]  M-I-Z-A.  Myers.  Phil Myers.  Myers, yeah.  Phil Myers.  Phil Myers.  I hear you.  There's nobody by that name.  You're not there?  No.  Okay, thank you.  Hello.  Yeah, I'd like to know if you could tell me if there's an Al Kill You there.  Who?  Al Kill You.  Al Kill You?  Yeah.  Kill You.  What's his name?  Al Kill You.  Al Kill You. 
[00:57:30]  Al Kill You.  Al Kill You.  No, nobody but that name.  Oh, there was supposed to be a few guys there, you know.  Uh, could you call, uh, how about Stanley Payne?  Stanley Payne there, you know?  Sally Schreiber.  Stanley Payne.  Stanley Payne.  Stanley Payne.  Hello?  Stanley Payne.  What are you trying to kid me now?  No.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:58:00]  You want to hear you kid me around now?  What?  I see you f***ing bum.  You want to hear you kid me, you motherf***er?  I'll come down and kick your f***ing mouth off.  I see why you go out and f*** your mother.  I'll f*** your mother, you stupid son of a bitch.  Why don't you come down here and have a little knock?  She ain't come down and tell me that.  I'll come down and tell me that.  I'll break you in the face.  I'll break you.  Give me a, I'll give you a hundred dollars to buy it.  A hundred dollars?  You haven't even gotten a hundred dollars.  Well, listen, you f***ing mother f***er out.  Come over here.  Come over here.  Come over here.  I'll tell you my age, what I'm doing to you. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  I'll cut you f***ing bull out.  You motherf***er.  You're a scumbag.  Hello?  I'll speak with Joe, please.  Joe.  Dildo.  Joe Dolan.  Dildo.  Joe Dildo.  Joe Dildo.  Not here.  You sure?  Positive.  Okay.  Okay, thanks.  Love that, man.  That's great stuff, huh?  Joe Dildo. 
[00:59:00]  Joe Dildo.  Sally Kramer.  That's my favorite one.  I'll kill you.  Again.  Yeah.  Hey, Roy, what's up?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Noah, how's the guy going, man?  Check it out.  You guys, I'm going to hell for telling you this.  I swore I would never tell anybody.  I worked in a cellular phone store out here on Long Island.  This is going back like three or four years.  Yeah.  Guy comes in, and he was from like an electrical company.  I can't really say the name because it's the big name place. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  And he had one of those little voice things.  What did Anthony call them?  The cancer things.  Cancer kazoo.  Yeah.  He has that thing, and he needs a cell phone that works with that thing.  So we're going through Ollie's phone.  I find a phone.  I set him up.  He walks out.  He leaves the little thing.  I start playing with it.  I got everybody in the place laughing.  One of my coworkers, he's cracking up because I'm trying to be like the guy,  and it sounds different when you have a regular voice.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  I turn around, and the guy is standing right there.  I am caught so bad.  It's unbelievable.  I just, I was like.  Did the guy yell at you?  No.  He just kind of said, you know, I need that thing.  I was like, oh, here you go.  I need that thing.  Right.  It charges up overnight.  Like, I had a little battery charger thing, and we're playing with that, trying to get  the thing to work.  Awful.  I totally got caught.  Nice.  All right, Roy.  It was fun.  Cool.  Thank you.  All right, boys.  Bye.  Bye.  It's kind of Voice Box Monday, right, Ant? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Why not?  Joe, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Hey, what's happening, man?  Good.  You sound like Scott.  Hello.  Hello.  Yes, Joe.  I have Voice Box.  What is that?  I have a Voice Box with cancer.  So what are we hearing right now?  My Voice Box.  It's electronic?  Yes.  How does that work?  Battery.  Sounds like it sounds pretty good, and it sounds like you're in your car.  No, I'm outside. 
[01:01:00]  You're outside?  Yes.  I don't know.  Like, how does it work?  It doesn't sound like the run-of-the-mill Voice Box.  It's like a small handheld megaphone.  And what?  You hold it to your voice.  Perhaps when you want to talk.  And the vibrations from your vocal cords.  Wow.  That does sound good.  Hey, they've made leaps and strides there in the Voice Box industry.  What Voice Box model do you have?  What is it?  I don't know the model. 
[01:01:30]  And how long have you had this thing?  Three years.  Three years?  When did they take your Voice Box out?  I had my Voice Box taken out five years ago.  Five years?  What?  Were you smoking?  A little too much.  A little too much?  Way too much.  Camel, no filter.  Camel, no filter?  Three packs a day.  Oh, if you can do it, you might as well do it right.  Yeah.  Three packs a day?  Yeah.  Oh, spitting the tobacco out.  I was in the guy.  It gets on your lips with the no filter. 
[01:02:00]  I was in the Vietnam War.  Really?  Smoked a lot in the war.  And I just came home and couldn't really adjust to society.  I'd have smoked if I was in Vietnam, too.  You know, you figure you're not going to come home anyway, so screw it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  So, what, does the VA take care of you?  Not as good as they should.  Yeah.  Bastards.  They don't take care of any of us, really.  That sucks.  How big is the microphone?  It's small, actually.  It's almost like a cufflink type of thing. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Hey, those gooks over there smoked a lot, too, huh?  Oh.  You can only hope some of them rice eaters have no voice boxes, too, right?  I'd still like to go back and find some.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, I never have to have to.  Can I say something profound?  Yeah, go ahead.  You have, what's that?  You can bleep it out.  Uh, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.  Well, try to say it so we don't have to bleep it out, though.  Yeah, so everyone can hear.  So everyone can hear.  All right.  That made it close enough. 
[01:03:00]  Even with the voice box, you can't say that.  F the gooks.  F the gooks.  We got it.  That got through.  Hey, how many did you take out when you were over there?  I lost a lot of count.  Really?  Where were you?  I was the real life Rambo, to be honest with you.  I hated him.  Where were you?  Well, where were you in the NOM?  Where was I?  Yeah.  Thank God.  All right, hold on.  Joe, there's a speech therapist on the line that's saying you're full of ass. 
[01:03:30]  John.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  This guy's lying.  Why?  If he has no voice box, then he can't have vocal cords to vibrate the machine that he  says he's using.  Oh?  Joe?  If you want to come meet me, you can.  Is that a turn on or something?  Is that a lie?  Oh.  If you want to come meet me, you can.  I think John's lying.  I would say John's full of crap.  No, this sounds legit.  I believe Joe.  I believe Joe.  Sure.  Sure.  No, if you guys wanted me to come to the studio, I would. 
[01:04:00]  Hey, Joe, Joe, what's the best way you took out a gook?  Uh, well, bassinet.  Oh, with bayonet?  Yeah, just straight knife.  Just cut him open.  Did you say bayonet or bassinet?  Oh, bayonet.  Bayonet.  Yeah.  Cut him open like a pig.  What, did you get him from behind or something?  No, no, straight at him.  Straight at him?  Me and you, you son of a bitch.  Let's go.  Nice.  Right, Gordon?  Nice.  Yeah, hey, and you know what? 
[01:04:30]  What?  I happen to go to clubs once in a while.  Yeah.  And I saw Jim Norton, and I think he's very funny.  Yeah.  And if I could have had two guys with me in Nam, I'd want it to be me in the middle, Norton  on my right, and Jeff Norris on my left.  You know, it's funny that you mention that, sir.  I'm actually working with Jeff Norris and the awful Rich Voss tomorrow night at Assholes 
[01:05:00]  in West Orange.  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  I don't know where you live, but if you want to come to West Orange, I'll work on it.  Come on down.  Jim, we'll bring you on stage.  Joe.  I'll come on down.  Could you repeat after me?  Could you say, well, doggie?  What's that?  Could you say, well, doggie, like Buddy Epson?  Well, doggie.  It sounds better than Buddy.  Sounds like.  Okay.  Well, Joe, thanks for helping us out with Voice Box Monday.  Jim Morgan, I'm going to take you up on an offer. 
[01:05:30]  I'm going to come to Rascals tomorrow.  All right, buddy.  All right.  Take care, man.  Thanks, Joe.  There goes Joe, man.  I love Vietnam vets.  Love them.  It did sound like you said bass and bass.  Yeah.  They tacked him with a little baby thing.  Oh, this is Buddy Epson, well, doggie, 2001.  Well, doggie.  Oh, God damn.  Which one do I have?  You got two of them.  You got, like, 1997.  Do I have the 97? 
[01:06:00]  I think I have the well, doggie, 2002.  Hold on.  No, that's the original.  That's well, doggie, 96.  96, 97.  96, 97?  Yeah.  Let me hear that one again.  Okay, this is Buddy Epson doing well, doggie, in 1996, 97.  Well, doggie.  Nice.  And I have well, doggie, 99.  Well, doggie.  And I got Buddy Epson, well, doggie, 2001.  Well, doggie.  That poor son of a bitch. 
[01:06:30]  I can't wait for 2002.  What happened to poor Buddy?  That first one, we were calling up Buddy Epson.  All the time.  All the time.  He's a good friend of the show.  We could call him right now if we wanted to.  Yeah.  Buddy Epson, of course, Beverly Hillbillies.  You remember him as Uncle Jed.  Right.  And his catchphrase was, we'll doggies.  You know?  Remember that?  Sure.  And when we first called him back in 96, when we were up in Boston, he sounded great.  It sounded just like the old Jed, if you have that one. 
[01:07:00]  No, you...  Oh, I got it.  Okay.  96.  We'll doggie.  Nice.  That was 96, man.  And that's...  The guy was like 90 years old then.  It was just like it was on the TV show.  So then the next time we talked to him, I'm like, all right, he doesn't sound as good.  Could you do the well, doggie?  And he did it, and it just, man, something's happening to his health.  Use it or lose it.  That's what he said.  Use it or lose it.  Here's the well, doggie from there.  Well, doggie.  So then we're thinking, all right, maybe we got him on a bad day. 
[01:07:30]  Maybe he just had laryngitis.  So we talked to him 2000, just last year.  2001.  2001.  Earlier this year.  And this was it, which just confirms that it just wasn't just that day.  The latest well, doggie.  Well, doggie.  Sounds like tires skidding.  That's awful.  My voice box hurts.  I know, my voice is hurting just talking about this.  Remember when he said, we asked him if the woman on the show, Miss Hathaway. 
[01:08:00]  Wait, can I interrupt you because it's going to take Rick a minute to find it.  Can you find Buddy Epson trying to sing the theme song?  Oh, yeah.  Do you still have that?  I sure hope so.  All right, go ahead, Anthony.  Sorry.  Yeah, Miss Hathaway from Beverly Hillbillies.  We asked Buddy Epson if she was a carpet muncher.  I mean, you know, a dyke.  And he didn't know what carpet muncher meant.  So he thought we were saying something else.  And here's him asking if we were saying this. 
[01:08:30]  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  A carpet muncher.  And then we were very excited and we wanted Buddy to sing the theme song.  If you don't like cringe radio, you know what?  Go see what the pop station's doing right now because this is going to make you cry.  Buddy Epson trying to sing the theme song to the Beverly Hillbillies.  Hillbillies.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, a poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed. 
[01:09:00]  And then one day, oh, he never, I'm still writing it.  When people, I'm sorry.  Tragic.  And then the people shooting his gun, then he said, what the hell is Buddy saying? 
[01:09:30]  I got to hear it again.  Come and listen to the story about a man named Jack, a poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed.  And then one day, oh, he, but he never, when I, I'm still writing it, when people, I'm sorry.  Oh.  The sorry is just, it was like Grandpa just crapped himself and you got to change it and he's like, look, I'm sorry. 
[01:10:00]  And before you write your hate email, we had no idea the guy couldn't, couldn't remember the song anymore.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  Anthony, Rick found another bit that we haven't played in years.  Which one?  The Mighty Mouse voice box thing.  Oh, well, we're on Voice Box Monday.  It's kind of Voice Box Monday.  We've had two people call in so far.  Yeah.  Little known fact, the guy that wrote the Mighty Mouse theme.  Yep.  When we were growing up, died of throat cancer.  Yeah. 
[01:10:30]  Tragic.  We all remember Mighty Mouse.  And the theme, oh, soundtrack to your childhood.  Right.  Guy died of throat cancer.  And we thought, well, you know, maybe he was still singing the Mighty Mouse theme.  A little tribute before he died.  It would have sounded something like this.  Mr.  Mr.  Mr.  Mr.  Crouble never hangs around when he hears this mighty sound. 
[01:11:00]  That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way.  Yes, sir, when there is a wrong to right, Mighty Mouse will join the fight.  There I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come.  On the sea, you're on the land, he gets the situation well in hand. 
[01:11:30]  So though we are in danger, we never despair, cause we know that where there's danger, he is there.  He is there, on the land, on the sea, in the air.  There I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come.  That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way.  Yes, we're all tipping our hats to Andy Kaufman, don't worry. 
[01:12:00]  We're not worrying at all.  We're just listening for his call.  Here I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come, there I come.  That means that Mighty Mouse is on the way. 
[01:12:30]  Ah, there you have it.  Nice.  All right, we have to take a break, Anthony.  On the way, we have more Voice Box bits for Voice Box Monday.  Great.  Also, Kimmy from Survivor to the Australian Outback was in Friday,  and we were talking about one of the most uncomfortable moments on our show  when she asked Pete Best about John Lennon.  Yes.  Rick found that audio for us.  We're going to play that after break.  And congratulations to Kimmy and everybody from Survivor that won the Retard Emmy, I call it. 
[01:13:00]  They had this Emmy Award for technical and, like, a best, what was it,  best reality show where people get money kind of category.  It's one of those feel-good, everyone-wins Special Olympic moments.  They're just making new categories, so everyone wins, I guess.  Right, even that mongoloid that tripped over his own shoelaces, he wins a ribbon.  He's very happy about it.  Yeah.  So it's kind of the Retard Emmy, so congratulations to Survivor for the Retard Emmy. 
[01:13:30]  They all get things in their Special Olympics?  They all get a prize?  They all get prizes, Norton.  Why?  Because they're all winners.  There's no losers at the Special Olympics.  Well, every one of them.  Maybe there's one that will cross the finish line first.  I don't understand.  Why would you give such a false message?  I don't either.  I don't like it.  I think, you know, we do that with Little League now and sports for kids.  They don't keep score.  They don't keep score on some of these games.  And everyone wins.  Yeah, it's good.  And then a few years later, they're not used to losing.  Somebody calls them a zero, and they open fire in the school. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  That's why it's happening, and I'm glad.  So continue not keeping score.  They could just have different categories, you know, in the Special Olympics.  That's good.  Teach your kids not to compete.  Yeah.  I can understand not being vicious about it, but do you have to be such little pansies  you can't take a loss on the chin?  You know what they should do?  Have the 440-yard dash in the Special Olympics.  Have a winner for that.  And then have subcategories, like fastest mongoloid with a tongue like a rib roast.  You know, something like that.  Maybe we should break it up so the guy that ran the race doesn't have to feel like he didn't win something. 
[01:14:30]  This is an awfully evil show to me.  What's the problem?  Really evil, Ted.  Heaviest skull.  Throw their heads up.  Holy S.  They can't even defend themselves.  They can't even defend themselves.  And the one with the heaviest head, you put a blue ribbon on it like a pig, and everybody  used to walk by and just slap it.  Most snot and saliva-ridden fingers?  There's a category.  Whoever makes the biggest duty? 
[01:15:00]  Holy mackerel.  Andy.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Man, I thought the Mighty Mouse song was twisted, but now I'm listening to this crap.  You guys are twisted.  It's a very evil show today.  Yeah.  I don't know why, but it's getting awfully evil.  You guys are wild, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  All right.  Anthony, we're going to go to break.  Is this set up, Rick, or do we have to go from A to B here?  Oh, you want to do a...  Yeah.  We want to play another clip from the retarded Laverne Shirley interviewing the celebrities  as they were going into the VMAs. 
[01:15:30]  I mean, the email on this was ridiculous, so we're playing some of the highlights over  again for you as we go to break.  This is them interviewing Dale Earnhardt Jr.  It was B, Rick.  I mean, it was A, not B.  Hold on.  Ready?  Stink ahead.  Hey, who are you?  We'd like to do an interview with you.  We want to do an interview with you.  Hi.  We want to do an interview with you.  Who are you?  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Who's that?  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Racecar.  Dale Earnhardt?  Oh, I'm sorry.  You don't look like him.  I'm sorry about your dad and everything. 
[01:16:00]  I'm sorry about your dad.  Yeah, you know, so how are you doing since, uh, are you running, uh, winning any races?  Yeah, he did.  He just won a race.  Okay, all right.  I don't watch, um.  I don't watch car racing.  Yeah, I'll enjoy you soon.  Yeah.  Yes, we are.  There we are.  Good, nice interview.  Nice, nice jacket.  Beautiful jacket.  Nice pantsuit.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Karen Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a place than listen to those, too.

Monday, you know.  People don't like getting involved on Mondays.  All right, we've still got a lot to do.  We do have a Jerry the King Lawler update. 
[01:18:30]  We do want to talk about the Michael Jackson concert.  Well, you were reading a review on it, right?  Yeah.  Awful.  He's out of his mind, which, you know, that's not news to anybody.  I guess he was at a party over the weekend at Tavern on the Green,  and he passed out into his handler's arms.  Did he?  Yeah.  The thing you picked him just going.  I'm feeling a little faint.  I think I have a touch of the vapors.  I thought it was ridiculous on the VMAs. 
[01:19:00]  Everyone giving him a standing ovation for dancing for 15 seconds, 20 seconds.  Dancing, first of all, doing the exact same moves from Beat It.  The guy hasn't updated any of his dancing in years.  And he just comes out there.  For some reason.  Hey, you like the dancing?  Yeah.  I was hoping he would update some of the moves.  Actually, I've been writing him and telling him I'll choreograph any of the newer things that he sang. 
[01:19:30]  No, I just don't know why he...  What is this, Rick?  Men in the Mirror.  Oh, is it?  I couldn't tell you in the beginning.  I'm going to make a change.  I'm going to make a change.  I'm going to make a change for once in my life.  I'm going to young boy.  Oh!  I'm going to feel real good.  Oh!  I'm going to make a difference.  I'm going to make it right.  Yeah.  As I turn up the collar. 
[01:20:00]  Oh!  Freaking fag.  You want to make out or something?  I'm going to make the swing just a-blow in my mind.  Howdy!  Freaking faggot in the street without enough to eat.  That's a stupid voice.  Wait, somebody put this retard out of his misery.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  You're Tzatzel?  No.  Charcoal briquette?  No, Tony.  Amolignon?  No.  You're a girl!  Oh! 
[01:20:30]  Oh!  We've got ourselves a pretty little faggot.  Asking him to change his way.  I'm Big Dick Black.  No, you're not.  No messes.  Could have been any clever.  If you want to make the world a better place,  take a look at yourself, then make a change.  Nice head, Dick.  What are you?  Gay.  Gay.  I'm back for a topper. 
[01:21:00]  Butt sex.  Penises.  It looks like a murex.  It's in the hole!  Cousin!  Cousin!  Awful!  Horrible.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  What are you?  Gay? 
[01:21:30]  He's apparently holding a huge tribute to himself.  Yeah.  That's what he does now.  It's a gigantic, star-studded tribute to Michael Jackson.  Complete with throne for him to sit on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because he is the king of pop, Anthony.  What I read, the review I read, was the queen of pop.  Does anybody know if there were any protests outside, just curious?  Were there any women's groups protesting?  No!  No.  No.  Okay, because he was alleged to have done some odd things. 
[01:22:00]  Some awful, horrible things, but thank God he had enough money to just bury it all  by paying off the parents of the child that he allegedly had sex with.  Know what that proved?  That everyone has a price no matter what.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  I love that.  You could even whore your own children out to a pedophile just for the right price.  I've been sending him pictures of my nephew for five years.  Nothing.  And nothing, huh?  No, just because it's interesting, the women's groups, you know, Andrew Dice Clay, we don't  like Andrew Dice Clay, but, you know, it looks just a few bad words. 
[01:22:30]  This guy has been able to skate all these charges and been able to hold this office of  Supreme Entertainer.  Anthony, we got some kids on the line out of nowhere, and we need to ask him what Michael  Jackson allegedly did to them.  All right.  What did Michael Jackson allegedly do to you?  The filthy Sanchez.  Ah, the filthy Sanchez.  The filthy Sanchez.  And what about you?  Doggy.  Doggy.  Doggy. 
[01:23:00]  And you?  Hot Carl.  Hot Carl, huh?  And what about you?  Piledriver.  Michael Jackson did a pile driver.  Oh, allegedly, of course.  Touch on the doll where Michael touched you.  Was it where your bathing suit covers?  If Michael touched you where your bathing suit covers, that's bad.  And you have to tell somebody.  Remember, say no, then tell.  Here's Michael talking to some preschoolers. 
[01:23:30]  Do you like having your background?  Did he have a voice box transplant, Anthony?  I don't remember Michael Jackson sounded like that.  I read a review about Michael Jackson's little tribute to himself.  Five hours long.  Just about five hours long.  A lot of it downtime.  Now, what they're doing is I guess they're taping this for a CBS special.  Yeah, I guess they weren't organized, so I'm so proud being part of the network that's handling this drivel.  So, a bunch of celebrities start coming out and singing Michael Jackson's songs. 
[01:24:00]  But it seems most of them don't know when to hit the stage, when to leave the stage, what parts to sing, how long to sing it.  It was like this big unorganized mess.  So, then Whitney Houston comes out to sing the end of one of these songs that they started.  The crowd gasps at her look.  She's gaunt.  She's, like, emaciated.  Anorexic, they're saying.  A horrified crowd gasped when she took the stage. 
[01:24:30]  So, this went on and on and on.  Then they show this big close-up of Michael Jackson's face.  Again, the crowd audibly, you hear,  at his, I mean, it's one thing to see him on stage with a hat pulled down and he's doing this thing.  But all the surgery.  Taring his face covering some of the stuff, right?  Yeah, all the surgery this guy has had.  And now his face is like powder from that movie Powder.  It's totally white because he's got the vitiligo or whatever it is.  Or he's bleaching himself. 
[01:25:00]  I don't know.  But his face is completely white.  Except for certain areas of the surgery that have had the pigment of what he was formerly.  Remember?  A black guy.  So, there's, like, some brown all around some of these surgery areas.  And the crowd, he's got that thin, non-existent nose.  And his lips are so red, it just looks like he's been sucking on something for hours at a clip.  Hours.  Big red puffy lips.  And the crowd gasps.  Then, part of the show, two hours, he spends up in a balcony, sitting on a throne with, who's next to him? 
[01:25:30]  I get Liz Taylor and Macaulay Culkin is up there with him.  Yeah.  As star after star hits the stage, talking about how great Michael Jackson is.  That's it.  You sat and paid $2,500 a ticket to watch this.  Then, big, fat, what's his name?  Marlon Brando.  Marlon Brando.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  Marlon Brando takes the stage.  I sit in a chair and talk about poor children that don't have money for food and are starving in certain areas of the world.  He sat there, this big load of crap, on a big couch, in front of people that paid $2,500 a ticket,  to talk about how greedy we are for not taking care of the world's children. 
[01:26:30]  How greedy we are.  $2,500 a clip.  Didn't he get booed or something?  Yeah, he started booing the fat man.  I would never boo Brando.  You know something?  The old Brando, you're absolutely right.  This new Brando isn't Brando.  He fell asleep next to a bean pod and woke up, and he's some nut now.  He's some lunatic.  I like the godfather era Brando.  I like the island of Dr. Moreau Brando, even. 
[01:27:00]  Not the early Brando, where he was doing things with Wally Cox.  And believe me, Wally Cox, no pun there.  And I don't like the new Brando, the big, fat one.  That Mario Cantone last night said looks like Humpty Dumpty sitting there, and he's rolling back.  Mario was hysterical last night.  Mario's on the phone right now.  Is he?  Mario.  Yeah.  No, this is Marlon Brando, and I don't appreciate you talking about me like that.  It sounds very funny.  You are greedy.  You're greedy bastards. 
[01:27:30]  And if you all ate seaweed, the world would be a better place.  Now, Marlon, what was the use of you coming out during a Michael Jackson thing?  Well, Michael asked me, and I said I'd love to come on stage, but of course I need to sit down.  So I sat down on a big couch with a wraparound glass and said, you know, very greedy people.  And the $2,500 is going partially to hungry children, needed children.  It's a good cause.  It really is.  Michael's right here.  Michael, come over here.  Get off your knees. 
[01:28:00]  Stand up.  Come here.  Come here.  Talk to them.  You people are slandering me and talking about me, and I really don't appreciate it.  I'm not a pedophile.  I never touch those children.  I am innocent.  Well, Michael, why'd you pay the parents so much money?  I didn't pay anybody.  I gave them credit cards.  Is that what it was?  What are you boys doing?  Mario.  Hello, it's me again.  Let me tell you something.  I saw Mario Cantone last night.  Yeah, where were you, Opie? 
[01:28:30]  At Caroline's.  Opie was not there.  No, Opie was not there.  Mario, I promised I would go see you, and I had something more important I had to take  care of.  Uh-oh.  You know, what was that?  Your penis?  No, I...  My brother is running a restaurant in Roslyn called Mim's, a really nice place, and they  had the grand opening for family and friends, and I had to show my support.  Well, I missed you so much.  Just for you, Mario.  I called you my...  I said, where's my Latin lover?  And Opie, where's Opie, my Latin lover? 
[01:29:00]  I called you my Latin lover.  You know?  In public, my Latin lover.  Opie, just for you, Mario kept the comedy club at 58 degrees.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  The Carolines was at 58 degrees last night.  They stood up and turned to a hot 100.  You are hysterical.  I gotta say, it's nonstop.  First of all, you went out...  It was like a telethon marathon that you were doing.  The guy's on stage for over two hours, and it was just all manic hysteria. 
[01:29:30]  Mario, I heard you killed.  I have a question.  Why is Caroline giving you the Sunday night slot?  You know what?  What is up with that?  I usually do...  If I want to do a whole weekend, believe me, I can.  All right.  But I just did a whole weekend, like, a few months ago, and I only do those every three  or four months.  But now, because I'm going to be going into rehearsals for Assassins, and I won't be able  to do four weekends, I'm trying to do these, like, Sunday night things.  I love Sunday nights, anyway.  Yeah.  I did, like, a Thursday through Monday about two months ago when I was on your show. 
[01:30:00]  Okay.  But, no, I do my weekends, believe me.  Well, what day is...  They're very good to me.  What day is good for you, Opie?  Well, I'd like to see them on, like, a Thursday night.  Oh, you don't want to see...  All right.  Start the weekend early, you know?  Well, you know what?  My next gigs are October 7th, 14th, and 21st, so those are Sunday nights, and I want you  there.  Which night are you not going, Opie?  Hey, I've seen Mario more than you have, my friend.  No, you haven't.  Yes, I have.  Yes, I have, my friend.  Probably not.  Stop fighting over me! 
[01:30:30]  Stop it!  He's my...  He likes me better than you, Anthony.  I love you both!  I love both my children!  I can't choose!  Mario's choice.  Take...  Take Opie!  Take him!  Which one gets strapped into bed, and which one has to scrub?  I'll tell you, Anthony, you have to scrub.  I have to...  And Opie gets strapped into bed.  I love when he goes, uh...  He's just like, I'm just torturing him.  Can I just hear, uh...  Tina! 
[01:31:00]  Get Tina!  Get Tina!  All right, did anybody hear about Liza Minnelli at the concert?  No.  I'm going tonight, by the way.  I'm going to the Michael Jackson concert tonight.  I am not paying for it.  I'm going for free, and I'm going for the material.  Just for the material.  You were that good, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I was that good.  And I'm just going to hear Liza Minnelli sing her song.  Yes.  She's singing, You Are Not Alone.  You are not alone!  She won't know the words.  Call me on the phone!  Leave a message up to the tone! 
[01:31:30]  The elephant man's bones!  I can't wait.  And I heard she does Over the Rainbow, and at the end she goes like this.  This is exactly what I heard she did.  My friend Kim called me, called me up and held a cell phone.  And she goes like this.  If happy little blue birds fly beyond the rainbow,  why, oh, why?  I love you, Michael.  Oh, God, no.  I swear to God.  She says, I love you, Michael. 
[01:32:00]  That's classic.  I'm so scared.  She is so stuck in, like, the 70s.  What did you say?  What?  She's so stuck in that 70s brand, like, I don't know, that Vegas entertainer of the 70s.  But, you know, well, I didn't see, no, in the 70s she was good, though.  That's what she did, Cabaret in New York, New York, which is her best film.  New York, New York is her best film.  All top shows.  Fabulous.  One of the best movies.  One of the most underrated Scorsese films, New York, New York.  Now, Mario, you're going to come in and go over the Emmys? 
[01:32:30]  I am.  I'm going to be talking about the Emmys.  I'm going to be in on the 17th.  Cool, cool.  So I will see you all then.  All right, Mario.  Thank you, Mario Cantone.  All right, you guys.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks for everything.  I had a great crowd last night because you guys, I really appreciate it.  It doesn't go unappreciated.  All right, right on.  Thanks a lot, Mario.  All right, boys.  Thank you, Mario.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  There he goes, our buddy, Mario Cantone.  That's a pisser.  We have to take a break.  Rick, another clip from the Retard Laverne Shirley interviewing the celebrities outside  the VMAs, Anthony.  All right.  This was a hit on Friday, so I think it's worth playing a few of these as we go to break. 
[01:33:00]  If we're all set up, I think this one is them talking to Tommy Hilfiger, the designer.  Yes.  Check this out.  Rick, it's still A, not B.  God, we've got to label these.  A, it's not A, B, D, Rick.  Look, every time, it's A and B is down.  Wrecks the timing, man. 
[01:33:30]  All right, here we go.  How are you doing?  Tommy Hilfiger.  Are you opening at the radio show?  I want to ask you a question.  Who do you think is going to win?  Who do you want to win tonight?  I'm not sure.  Well, I'll decide after Watson performs.  I know you're a designer.  Do you think a lot of people are wearing your clothes?  I hope so.  All right.  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  No, you don't.  Get a nice suit on, Tommy.  Hurry, Tommy.  Now, let's turn on the PA system and start the fun. 
[01:34:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Afternoon radio.  This is it.  You can't go anywhere else.  Nowhere to go.  That's like saying you don't like Earth.  You're leaving.

The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW.  New York.  And we're back with the O&A show.  We're distracted, sorry, because a shower's going on behind us. 
[01:35:30]  I think it's a guy, man.  You guys are getting all excited, and I think it's a guy.  It's just, see, it's very hard.  We're here, our window in the studio faces an apartment building.  And the windows on this side of the apartment building are all bathroom windows.  So, uh, some of the people don't have curtains, don't have that window with the wavy glass, 
[01:36:00]  so you can't see through it.  None of them.  Yeah, none of them.  None of them.  So, uh, occasionally we look out, and there's people showering.  The window is in the shower itself, and it's a pretty, fairly big-sized window.  So you can see the whole, pretty much the whole body.  You can see knees to head.  So, uh, sometimes the window gets a little fogged up, but you can still make out what's going on in there.  So, this window was kind of far down, a little further away than the normal ones we look at.  We got a bad angle on this one.  Bad angle.  So, uh, who threw up the alert? 
[01:36:30]  A stinky fag.  You threw out the alert.  You have to confirm that it's female before you tell the guy.  I asked Rachel if it was a guy or a girl.  She could look if it was a guy.  You know something?  Oh, come on.  Rachel, Rachel, is that a guy or a girl showering?  You know, I think it's a guy because the butt is so big.  It was a big, white ass.  And Rick was saying, you know, he's being so aggressive about it.  Yeah, it was a white washcloth in the guy's hand.  And he's going at the crack. 
[01:37:00]  Being a guy, I would have to say it's a guy because, you know, the women are much, much, much more careful with it.  I don't know.  Women can't be pretty aggressive in the shower.  Really?  Spoken from my own.  Nah, that guy was rubbing off some cranky ass.  Rachel, go look again.  Make sure.  Is he still showering?  It's got to be a guy, right?  Yeah.  All right, wait.  She's taking a look.  The window is pretty fogged up.  Thank God.  All right, we're back with the show here.  If you're not in the New York area and you want in on the show today, 866-2774-WOW. 
[01:37:30]  Logan from Philly.  Logan.  Hey, yo.  What's up, man?  You've been waiting an hour and a half.  And what do you got for the show today?  All right.  I went to see Jay and Silent Bob strike back with my friend Adam last night.  Hold on.  You got the ultimate wow outside Jay and Silent Bob, the movie, right?  Yeah, we didn't have a wow outside.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  We're going to get to you in a few minutes, but we've got to make sure the shower thing  is okay.  Hold on.  All right.  I think he's done.  I think...  Shower's done?  I think he's done.  I mean, I don't see anyone walking by.  I mean, I think he's right in front of the shower. 
[01:38:00]  That's where his shower is.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where all the showers are.  They're right near the window.  It's the shower itself.  What is the sense in that?  There's a huge window in your shower.  You happen to be a female, so your neighbors...  Oh, thank God.  We've seen some nice stuff going on in that shower.  The last time we saw a shower, it was an unbelievable view.  Yeah.  The girl was doing everything.  She was...  That'd be something else.  She was shaving everything, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, we saw the...  Remember the guy...  She had to take care of her underarm.  She had to take care of her legs.  She had to take care of the coochie.  A year and a half ago, there was a couple having sex in the shower. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, yeah.  And they were going at it with the window opened.  Mm-hmm.  And the people on the street, right in front of Hooters, were looking upstairs and...  Yeah, because it was only about 20 feet off the ground, the window, right?  Yeah.  There were like 100 people just standing there watching.  Watching them have sex.  That's great.  Nice.  Okay, now we're distracted.  Where were we with this show?  Logan.  Yeah, let's go back to...  Hey, Logan.  Yo.  All right, hold on a few more minutes.  We're going to get to you, okay?  All right.  All right, cool.  He's got an ultimate wow outside Jay and Silent Bob movie. 
[01:39:00]  I was waiting quite a long time, Opie.  Yeah, be patient, Logan.  We'll get to you in just a few minutes.  All right?  All right, there he is.  Hold on a second.  Can I plug real quick?  Yeah, go ahead, Norton.  Zero, I am.  I have to plug Rascals West Orange tomorrow night with Voss and Jeff Norris.  And the number is area code 973-736-2726.  And then for the weekend, I know you can't plug two things at once, and this is going  to get effed up.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie, 845-462-3333. 
[01:39:30]  Does that spell anything fun?  No, it doesn't spell anything wacky, but...  Zing-a-rific.  4-6-2-3-3-3-3-3.  We put 4-3 so you can remember it.  Adam, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Hey, buddy.  I'm calling to really complain about this damn Michael Jackson crap.  Okay.  Why?  Because somebody somewhere decided that Michael Jackson was a genius.  And you see this from time to time, where, you know, some commercially successful artist 
[01:40:00]  all of a sudden gets dubbed by somebody as a genius, so then everybody and their mother  has to buy into this.  Yeah.  And the Michael Jackson thing, they just did the same thing with Janet Jackson not too  long ago on MTV.  They had a big tribute to Janet Jackson.  The music is crap, bought by mindless people that are just buying it because someone says  it's good.  Can I tell you something?  What's that?  You should only do tributes when the person is barely alive.  I love when they do the tributes at the Oscars and stuff.  Isn't that great when they wheel him out?  And they wheel out the guy and he's barely alive like they did with Alfred Hitchcock and 
[01:40:30]  John Wayne and all these guys.  Christopher Reeve they did a tribute to?  They did.  You remember that?  Did they really?  They wheeled him out and they all gave him a standing ovation.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  Watching it.  Look at what we can do.  Yeah.  Janet Jackson, too young for a tribute.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You got to be on your last leg before you get the tribute.  My favorite was the Kirk Douglas tribute and then they bring Kirk out.  Yeah.  The Oscars gave him a little tribute at some point.  And he could barely speak a word. 
[01:41:00]  You're remembering him in the old gladiator movies and stuff.  Right.  Jesus.  All right, Adam.  Sorry state of the way.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  You got to talk.  Thank you.  Michael Jackson, though.  You know how the whole thing ends?  His little tribute?  Logan.  Yo.  Oh, hold on.  I interrupted Anthony.  You got that Ultimate Wow story, right?  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  I interrupted Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, Ed.  I didn't mean to do that.  You know how the whole Michael Jackson thing ends?  They drag out the Jackson Five. 
[01:41:30]  You know.  All the rest of the little Jackson brothers.  And they sing a medley of some of the songs that made the Jackson Five so famous back years ago.  And they sing it like you remember hearing all the backup and stuff.  And the music is there.  Michael sings like behind it.  You know what I mean?  He's not on the beats.  He sings his rendition of the songs kind of behind the brothers.  Just like they'll do one line and then Michael redo the line again. 
[01:42:00]  And like just sing it the way everyone remembers it.  But no, he's too good.  He doesn't even like hanging out with those brothers.  You know that.  You know that was something his militant father, Joe Jackson, made him do.  You get them all out there.  Okay, Daddy.  To help their careers.  Of course.  Ben, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  Oh, hey?  Yeah.  Yo, that's Michael Jackson's the man, yo.  What are you talking about?  Why he got their price?  I think he really did touch a kid. 
[01:42:30]  He'll be in jail so fast you wouldn't believe it.  No, he's got the money to get out of any allegations by buying off.  So, wait, wait.  The whole problem went away after he made that big payment.  All right.  No, no.  It doesn't mean he did it or didn't do it, but it's a little suspicious, don't you think?  No, but I...  He would have had to go to court.  You know how long that court...  He would have had to go to court for a year.  No, he wouldn't go to court.  Dude, not if the charges were dropped, he wouldn't.  Wait a minute.  Oh, you're saying that he paid him off so he wouldn't have to go to court and spend time in court. 
[01:43:00]  And he would have been in the National Enquirer.  He would have been on TV.  He spent another day to court, show him to go to court.  That's not the business.  He got to get rid of him.  No, what would have been in the National Enquirer?  That he didn't do it if he proved that he didn't do it?  No, no.  But say it took a year for him to prove that he actually didn't do it, all that time he  was in court and flashing his name, you know what I'm saying?  And not to mention, if somebody could give you a million dollars and they could do whatever  they want with your kid, are you saying that? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Well, I think everyone has...  You're a bad father there.  Huh?  I think you're a bad father.  Nobody could give me any amount of money.  I don't have kids.  Yeah.  Dude, 20 million I think it was.  Wasn't it 20 million?  It was something.  Yeah.  It was a lot of money.  It wasn't just a million dollars.  I think it was 20 million.  To me, it doesn't matter.  Plus, not to mention, his thing, his thing, he did that to two kids.  What's that, $40 million?  Did you think somebody's going to pay $40 million?  Are you serious?  It doesn't add up to me.  And don't get me wrong, dude.  Dude, I think the kids were asking for it. 
[01:44:00]  I mean, don't get me wrong.  Oh, man.  Dude, this is sick, man.  Yo.  All right, yo.  I set my pee shows.  Just stop trash.  All right, man.  See, wait.  And another thing.  This is why you guys couldn't get any good freaking people to talk to at the movie awards  because you trashed so many people.  Everybody's mad at you.  No, they walked by everybody.  Ben, Ben, they were walking by no matter what.  So that's how we handled it.  Entertainment Weekly dissed them, too.  I mean, they were passing by everybody.  They passed by all the real media outlets. 
[01:44:30]  They stopped for the MTV cameras.  Honestly, I think you guys have a funny show, and soon they're going to give you your own  TV show.  I'm sure that'd be...  All right, Ben.  Great.  Thank you.  How about Mike from Online 7?  Online 7.  Let's go to Line 7.  Mike, what's up, man?  Hey, O&A.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up, Mike?  Hey, you guys see the New York Post article this morning?  Talked about Michael Jackson's party at Tavern on the Green.  Had all those kids at his table.  Really?  He had a table with, like, 10-year-olds, 12-year-olds till 1 or 2 in the morning. 
[01:45:00]  No wonder he was exhausted.  1 or 2 in the morning?  He's keeping...  Like, who are the parents that are allowing their children to be with Michael Jackson at  all hours of the morning?  That's like us going to the Playboy Mansion and hanging out with Playmates till 1.  We'd be tired, too.  They're trying to hit the pedophile jackpot.  And you know what they say?  You know what his excuse is?  His excuse, and everyone else that backs this guy, is, oh, he lived a life where he wasn't  allowed to be a child, so he just acts like a child and likes being around children. 
[01:45:30]  That's the same M.O. as the soccer coach that pulls hairless ass.  Wow!  It is!  Holy ass.  It absolutely is.  I mean, so what?  I don't care how he got there.  You know what I mean?  Oh, here he goes, Rock.  Who's flinging their children's toward this meat grinder?  But don't listen to Opie and Anthony, and don't say certain things, because the kids  might be listening to bringing them.  Stop it!  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[01:46:00]  Well, you've got to stop.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  That was really Michael Jackson with NSYNC in the beginning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought it was the clown from Poltergeist.  Yeah, you remember the clown from Poltergeist?  Wow, that's a good one.  We'll take it easy.  You guys suck.  That's a good one.  What did the clown do?  He grabbed the kid in the bed.  The boy.  CJ.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, CJ.  Hey, I was wondering if you got a chance to see the Behind the Music last night about Blind 
[01:46:30]  Melon.  Yeah, let me tell you something about Behind the Music, too.  They're running out of bands.  I mean, no offense to the Blind Melon fans at all, but come on.  I mean, No Rain was a good song, but I mean, a hole behind the music on the band.  Oh, did you even see it or not?  I saw the last ten minutes when they found him dead on the tour bus.  Really?  Yeah.  It was pretty good.  They were running out of ideas.  I thought that was one of the better ones they did, but...  Did they talk to B-Girl?  No, no.  Was she on?  I didn't get that far.  See, they should have gotten her.  Well, let me tell you something. 
[01:47:00]  Back when I did that, what a little heifer that kid was.  I want to know how big B-Girl got.  All right, guys.  Later, Crumpet Munches.  All right.  Hey, Crumpet Munches.  Yeah, I saw part of the Blind Melon behind the music.  It's just...  They're running out of bands at this point.  I know.  All right.  Hey, Logan.  Yo.  I hate to do this to you, but we've got to take a break.  Rick's telling me we're late.  You're late?  Yeah.  You've been waiting like an hour and 40 minutes, man.  Yeah, man.  I'll get on soon. 
[01:47:30]  All right, cool.  And it's a really good story?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We can't wait for it.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  All right.  There he is, Logan.  We'll get to him.  Hey, Anthony, remember on Friday when Kimmy from Survivor was in the studio?  Yes.  And we were talking about the time when Pete Best was in here and how uncomfortable it got  because Kimmy wanted to ask Pete Best a question.  Pete Best, you remember him.  The first drummer, the Beatles.  Right.  And we had him here in the studio because he was going around with a bunch of other has-beens,  a bunch of other musicians.  And Kimmy asked him a little awkward question. 
[01:48:00]  Kind of put the brakes on the whole interview.  Yeah.  I want to ask him a question.  Sure.  Okay.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Come on.  I want to know, like, when John Lennon got shot, were you kind of like, ha-ha?  Whoa, Kimmy.  Oh, my God.  Kimmy, Kimmy, Kimmy, that's sick.  Kimmy comes out with the worst goddamn question ever.  Oh, come on.  Pete, once again, I want to apologize because we don't even know this girl,  and she comes out with some kind of a wacky off-the-wall look. 
[01:48:30]  Stinky can't even take it.  You know, we just found a brand-new member of the show, though.  Didn't she get hotter asking that question?  No boundaries with this chick.  None.  Oh, my God.  Pete, please, again, let me apologize for that question.  Oh, my God.  Now, Yoko would have been hit.  That would have been a treat.  Did you have any communication with the guys after you were 62?  Yeah, I saw him a couple of times.  Yeah?  And what was it like?  Not much said.  No?  What was the reason that was given to you? 
[01:49:00]  What was the reason they gave?  I wasn't a good enough drummer.  Not a good enough drummer.  And then they got Ringo.  Well, yeah, that's the debatable question, isn't it?  Wow.  Because now.  But I never held up water.  So then it leads to a whole lot of other things.  What was it?  Did you see anything coming?  Did you see?  No, no.  You didn't see this coming?  No, that was the funny thing.  After two years, none of the three,  you didn't know anything which was going to happen.  Yeah.  It came completely out of the blue.  You weren't an a-hole or anything, were you?  Because I know there's some bands you get a member of, 
[01:49:30]  and you're like,  this guy's a jerk, but we've got to get rid of him.  No, no, no.  No?  So you were like, cool guy, having fun,  got along with everybody,  and they just gave you the boot.  The big boot.  Jesus.  I know what that feels like.  Oh, you got another funny joke there?  No.  No?  I know what it feels like to face every joke.  You got a challenger exploding joke or something  you're going to just throw in?  Kimmy?  No, I'll just sit here.  No, don't be quiet.  I'm waiting for your next question.  Think of another question for me.  Okay.  Mom, I'm staring her down now. 
[01:50:00]  There you go.  There was the clip we promised you from Friday's show.  That is a tad.  Well, it wasn't.  We were talking about it on Friday,  and we dug it up for you.  A tad brutal.  Uncomfortable, right?  All right, we'll take another break.  As we go to break,  another clip of the retarded Laverne and Shirley  at the VMAs,  kind of hanging with the celebrities.  This one is really funny.  Them talking to Nate Dogg.  Nate Dogg.  Nate Dogg.  D-O-double-G.  Nate Dogg.  And in the middle of the interview,  they thought they saw Kato Katelyn. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  This is really good,  and we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Excuse me, sir.  What is your name?  Nate Dogg.  How are you?  Excuse me.  What's your name?  Nate Dogg.  Nick.  Nate Dogg.  Nate Dogg.  How are you?  Nick.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Okay.  Okay.  That's a nice outfit.  I got to ask you one question.  What?  Who are you hoping to win?  Best group?  The best group.  Best, uh...  Who's nominated for best group?  I have no idea.  You tell me.  That's information I'm waiting to hear.  Okay.  All right.  That's a nice outfit. 
[01:51:00]  Nice hat.  Where'd you get it?  Nice sunglasses.  Nice sunglasses.  I had it made.  One of my friends made it.  Woody Wood.  Okay.  Nice outfit.  I wish you a lot of luck.  Well, thanks a lot.  Okay.  All right.  What do you sing?  Hey, Kato Katelyn.  All right.  Thank you.  Kato Katelyn.  Looks like Kato Katelyn.  Listen, listen, listen, listen.  The award-winning Opie and Anthony show.

You know, it's Voice Box Monday, Anthony, and it's not going too well so far.  Well, it started off with a bang.  You know, we said it was Voice Box Monday for no apparent reason. 
[01:53:00]  And we got a couple of people that called up.  Not having really Voice Boxes, but having vocal cords removed.  One guy had a Voice Box.  I thought we'd have some wacky fun, and no one wants to play.  No one wants to play along on this juryry Monday.  So we're looking for people that have Voice Boxes today to give the show a call, okay?  Call us up with your cancer kazoo.  Anthony, finally, we've got to get to Logan, because he's got a story.  He's got the ultimate wow outside Jay and Silent Bob, the movie. 
[01:53:30]  Logan!  Hold on.  We were going to go to the Joan Rivers thing.  I wanted to talk about that a little bit.  Not that I know Logan's story is probably cool, but I'd rather right now stay on track a little bit.  Well, it's kind of important for the wow thing, because we need more wow stories from Philly.  Well, you know.  Logan, we'll definitely get to it.  I just wanted to...  Logan, hold on just a few more minutes.  I don't want to mix everything up.  Please, hold on.  Sorry, Logan.  Just a couple of minutes.  All right, I understand.  Okay.  Right, I'm sure you do.  Now, what do you want to talk about the...  You had a story there about Joan Rivers, dog dying. 
[01:54:00]  You're blowing off Logan for Joan Rivers' dog?  I'm not blowing off Logan.  I was just being postponed for just a...  I'd be a little pissed off if I was Logan at this point.  A couple of minutes.  You're blowing off for a dead dog.  He's a good fan.  He'll hang in there for a little bit.  Norton, how pissed are you that you can't get anybody to write about you in the post  and they're writing about Joan Rivers' dead dog?  I know.  A goddamn dog dying.  I think next time I should run it over and then maybe they'll have to cover me as part of it. 
[01:54:30]  Did the dog kill itself?  Because it was Joan's.  Oh, my dog...  Was it my dog Spike?  Which dog was it?  Was it Spike or my dog Melissa?  Which one?  They said Joan Rivers' dog died.  I thought it was Melissa.  No, no.  Let me read.  It wasn't?  Are you sure?  It says Joan's...  Have you looked at her?  She looks like a Dalmatian.  It's Joan's good dog goes to heaven after 17 years.  Joan Rivers, 17-year-old Yorkshire Terrier, Spike, who appeared on The Tonight Show back in 1980. 
[01:55:00]  You can't get on The Tonight Show.  I can't get on that one either.  And the cover of People Magazine.  The dog was on the cover of People Magazine, Jim.  Died at home of heart failure.  The comedian's publicist said yes to that.  All right. 
[01:55:30]  We get it.  Spike died Saturday while being cared for by a Rivers assistant.  Oh, man.  That assistant gone.  I'm Spike, Spike.  Hi, this is Joan.  I'm calling from out of town.  Could you put Spike on the phone?  Put Spike on the phone.  Hello? 
[01:56:00]  Put Spike on the phone.  Um, Joan.  There's something I can tell you.  What?  I'm out of town.  I left you with Spike with you to make sure everything's fine.  Put Spike on the phone.  Hi, Spike.  Hello, my love.  Spike.  John, um, Spike passed on last night.  Oh, no.  You're fired.  You're fired, you aunt.  You killed my Spike.  Just like my husband.  What was his name?  Edgar.  Uh, Edgar.  Just like Edgar.  Just like Edgar. 
[01:56:30]  Spike died.  I have to sit shiver.  I'm sitting shiver for my dog.  Um, Anthony, I wonder if the assistant was eating prime rib at the time.  Maybe she kicked it.  Oh, no.  People don't even know how funny that really is.  I'm going to put Spike's ashes in an errand until I die.  And we'll get buried together.  Vincent Saro, get me a box of wine.  Three rights, make a left. 
[01:57:00]  Three rights, make a left.  Anthony, Joe.  Joe wants to say something.  Give me a chance to us, Spike.  Shut up.  I'm wondering, how could this all be 17 years old if it was on TV in 1980?  Uh, 22 years ago.  You know what?  It says Johnny Carson's show in the 80s.  I'm sorry.  Oh, in the 80s.  All right.  I'm saying they got a mix-up on the mat there.  You guys suck.  Thanks for paying close attention, Joe. 
[01:57:30]  Thank you.  I'm going to go.  Couldn't do a show without you.  Thank you.  Your dog seems to have taken a crap on Ed McMahon.  Oh, took a crap on me, Johnny.  Uh, all right.  So, Rivers, traveling in Europe for a week, was saddened by the death and planned to fly  home shortly.  I have to fly home.  Uh, I have to bury the body out in the backyard.  Ah.  Uh, Spike made his television debut on Johnny Carson's show in the 1980s, appeared on the 
[01:58:00]  covers of TV Guide and People, Heavy Guide, headlined with Rivers at nightclubs around the  world, and was Mr. February in a Ralston Perina Company calendar.  He appeared on Broadway in 1995.  Look at the resume this effing month has.  I can't get interviewed by stepping out.  And Sally Maher and her escorts.  He also had his own page on Rivers' website.  Yay!  How's your website coming, Norton?  There's like two more things to be done, and it's done, but, you know, I'm just, I'm 
[01:58:30]  lazy.  Oh.  Uh, tonight, we have, uh, Joan Rivers and her dog, Melissa.  Ho, ho, ho.  That's the daughter, Johnny.  Ho, ho.  Uh, poor Jim Norton can't even get on my show, yet a dog is here this evening.  Ho, ho. 
[01:59:00]  Ho, ho.  Look at our website.  I'm looking right now.  It's got little Spike.  Our beloved Spike is gone, it says on our website.  And when you click...  Spike, it's got a little statement from her.  Spike, my beloved 17-year-old Yorkie, died peacefully at home of heart failure on Saturday.  September 8th.  He will be missed beyond belief.  But he will never be forgotten.  Spike was given to me by Melissa's governess. 
[01:59:30]  Governess?  She wasn't a governess.  Right after my husband's head, his heart attack, when Melissa had gone off to college.  He was the runt of the litter, and I was the aunt of the litter.  Melissa was the aunt of the litter.  I could hold him in the palm of my head, and they were going to kill him.  And the governor said, you need someone to love, and I did.  Spike became the love of my life. 
[02:00:00]  One day when Melissa came home, they surprised me.  I thought it was going to be a surprise party, and I had peanut butter spread all over my genitals.  And Spike, what?  It's an urban legend.  Yeah, that's an urban legend.  I knew that person, though.  You need someone to love.  Okay, here's the rest of a statement.  I took Spike with me everywhere.  He was Spike the Wonder Dog.  You freaking nut.  Did she really write that?  This is really her words.  He made his national debut on the Tonight Show starry, Johnny Goss, in the early 80s. 
[02:00:30]  He was featured on the Covers of People TV Garden with Mr. February, blah, blah, blah.  Spike, oh, wait a minute.  Let me get it.  Let me get it back.  Spike was a piece of history of my life.  He went through everything with me 24 hours a day and slept with me virtually every night.  Ew!  That poor effing dog!  Imagine that.  She's crawling into bed.  New contest.  $1,000 for Spike's remains.  Oh, nice.  Okay. 
[02:01:00]  No, dude.  Dude.  We have a lot of listeners.  You know something?  This radio show.  Yes.  $2,000.  $2,000?  $2,000 for Spike's remains.  It's got to be confirmed.  And we'll drop its body from the top of this building.  38 floors.  $2,000 for Spike's remains.  And it's really got to be Spike.  I don't care how you get it.  Oh, no.  Look, I didn't read the bottom of this.  It's already been cremated.  Spike was cremated with his favorite purple dinosaur toy.  His favorite blanket in my old cashmere bathrobe.  The one I wore all those nights we spent together in Spike. 
[02:01:30]  Spike is gone, but he will live on here at the website forever and ever in my heart.  These pants, buds.  He made extremely comfortable by two wonderful vets.  What?  Oh, he was made comfortable.  You know, she was probably keeping that thing alive years after it should have been put down.  Spike, come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Oh, get a vet. 
[02:02:00]  Pay the vet money.  I don't care.  Make a mechanized Spike.  Ugh.  Like Chester, Anthony?  Oh, Chester.  Chester, Spike, me and Judy, all in the same coffin with the ashes.  Three rights make a left part of the wine.  My good friend Judy from Massachusetts, I don't know, Chester died years ago.  She cremated it and keeps it in an urn in the living room for Anthony to be real uncomfortable around until his divorce. 
[02:02:30]  Craig, what's up?  I think I'm very concerned about this.  I got to tell you about the whole Spike thing, guys.  Why did Opie and Anthony have to come to BCN?  Oh, wait, I'm doing Rocco.  Hold on.  Oh, Spike.  Craig, what's up?  I think we got to get an autopsy on Spike, guys.  Why?  I'm very concerned she didn't Edgar-ize him.  You know what I mean?  Oh, Edgar-ize him? 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, she did to her ex-husband, you know, splitting a little roofie at night and put him out.  What are you trying to say, Craig?  We have no idea that Joe Rivers did that.  I'm just wondering, you know?  All right.  I just think we should do an autopsy.  All right, Craig.  Thank you.  Bye.  Edgar shot himself.  Oh, Logan.  Right.  Yeah, Edgar shot himself.  Yeah, he wasn't in an autopsy.  Hey, Logan.  That's awful.  We thought we lost you.  You have the wow story from Philly, right?  Yeah.  What happened to your phone?  Oh, it died. 
[02:03:30]  It died.  Why?  Because I guess the battery went out.  You were only on hold for about two hours.  Yeah, right.  Well, there's another guy who's been waiting for three.  That's my cordless.  So what?  You found another phone?  What?  You found another phone to call back, obviously, right?  Yeah, I want to pay for them.  All right, cool.  Hold on a second.  All right.  We're just finishing up with the Joan Rivers story.  All right, Anthony.  Spike was cremated.  I hear Joan Rivers will be wearing Spike at the next Oscar broadcast.  What are you wearing?  What are you wearing? 
[02:04:00]  I'm wearing a Spike.  I'm wearing a wonderful Spike.  We had him corded and gutted.  And I had his fur made into a lovely hat.  Look at this.  I'm wearing a Spike.  Now Spike can stay with me.  I had Spike skinned and his skin and fur rolled up into custom tampons so I could have Spike with me.  Well, like I've had my period in the last 80 years.  Oh, God.  I'm wearing a Spike with Edgar accents. 
[02:04:30]  Edgar accents.  And actual earrings made from the bullets he blew his head up.  There we go.  What did he use?  A deuce deuce?  Over a 3-8.  Glock, glock.  I got a brooch.  I'm very rarely uncomfortable in the studio.  Come on, John.  What's up?  It's ancient instrument.  Who, me?  Yeah, go, John.  Go ahead.  I heard there's a discrepancy on Spike's age there.  He's a Dominican dog. 
[02:05:00]  His father's from the Dominican Republic.  Thanks for being in the Yorkshire area.  See you later.  And he has an awesome curveball.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Let's go to Tommy.  I save everything.  Look at what I'm wearing around my waist as a belt.  It's Melissa's umbilical cord and afterbirth.  I wear the afterbirth as a hat.  And then I have my Edgar slippers.  I hear it's very in.  It's actually Edgar's feet.  I've hollowed them out to make Edgar slippers.  And I have Edgar gloves. 
[02:05:30]  I say, why not just wear Edgar's feet everywhere as Edgar, his slippers, accented with Spike fur.  It looked like Bigfoot.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm talking with the Edgar larynx.  I've got Edgar's larynx.  Look, it's got a mind of its own.  Shoot me, please.  Shoot me.  Shoot me.  I can't live with this anymore. 
[02:06:00]  I was going to have another facelift.  I ran out of skin.  But now I'm going to use Edgar's skin.  I swear to God.  One more facelift.  I'll have bad breath and a goatee.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  It's my goodness.  Ah, Tommy.  Oh, what's going on, boys?  Just getting very uncomfortable.  What's up?  What's going on?  Listen, I live with my grandmother.  And right at the present time, we have two chihuahuas.  Yeah.  She had about, since I've been born, she had about eight, nine dogs. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  There was no technology in the past.  So my backyard was like Pet Sematary.  Yeah.  But years back, she started cremating the dogs.  She has five boxes of dogs on her, I guess, like her end table before she goes to bed at night.  How awful is that?  She says goodnight to every picture of, and there's a box of the dogs behind it.  Don't they understand how goddamn creepy that is for normal thinking folks?  And I have a god damn dog ashes.  I got a 27-year-old chihuahua that his heart stopped like three years ago, 
[02:07:00]  and my grandma lets them bring him every day to get fluids.  The vet drives around in the Mercedes.  My grandmother bought it for her, basically.  Dude, how long have you been living at a big motel?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What?  Horrible.  Wait, back that story up.  What?  What?  My dog, it's not my dog.  It's my grandmother's dog.  It's a chihuahua.  The dog's heart stopped like two or three years ago,  and somehow the doctor has to give it this medication the exact same time.  It goes for fluids, the dog, every single day to keep this dog alive.  Every day to keep this mud alive.  Your dog craps, pees all over the place.  It's hind legs basically don't even work. 
[02:07:30]  The dog has to be dragged around.  It's horrible.  Isn't that wonderful?  And the dog's room is bigger than mine.  I'm 24 years old.  Selfish.  It's the mother's why I'm getting married.  What's in the box?  Is it the actual bodies, or is it cremated?  No, no, no.  They cremate the dogs.  They cremate these animals.  Yeah.  And then the people put them around their house.  You know what you want to do?  He's the scary part.  Dude, you want to take the ashes and then somehow dump them into her food over a period of time?  And then let her know she ate her dog and crapped it.  Ah, that's great.  She'll be going through a dumpster.  Get us on in a half hour. 
[02:08:00]  Maybe I'll do that, Norton.  Or put it in a carpet-fresh box.  Vacuum the rug.  Sprinkle it down.  You're carpet-fresh.  You know damn well Joan held on to those ashes.  She couldn't keep Edgar's little...  Edgar.  Edgar.  She couldn't keep Spike's ashes.  I mean Spike's body, so you know damn well.  Don't dance.  Melissa.  Melissa dust off Spike's little thing.  Dust off the earth, Melissa.  When they cremate them, the vet, they don't do it.  Obviously, then they mail the box to you.  So who knows what you got in that box. 
[02:08:30]  There might be like a big skin.  They might just bury your dog and give you like a box or whatever.  I'm sure.  They give you some fireplace ashes.  I've got to be your vet in the next life.  Have a good day, boys.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dobby.  Thank you, Dobby, for your good knowledge.  That's disturbing, man.  Hey, Logan.  Yo.  Hold on, all right?  I can barely hear you, man.  Just hold on.  All right.  We have to do some commercials.  Finally done with the Joan Rui thing.  No!  Well, I guess next we'll finally get to Logan's wow story from Philadelphia. 
[02:09:00]  Yes, Rick?  Okay, yeah, we can go to the FU line and we'll be back.  We also have the latest on Jerry the King Lawler, if you've been following the story.  That is Jerry the King Lawler.  And his ex, this guy, man.  You know, it's pathetic enough when a guy has to go through this, the breakup of a marriage  or a relationship.  It's bad enough, especially when you're like a kid and you just, I don't know, you spill  your guts to a friend and then years later you just feel like an ass for even saying it. 
[02:09:30]  He's spilling his guts on a website.  He's spilling his guts to everybody.  It's like, have some pride, man.  Oh, have some pride.  Yeah, we got the, we, you gotta wear this.  Those boys at IBM are depending on you.  Have some pride.  Brad?  I was thinking more fast times.  Brad, yeah, that's what I mean.  Brad with the uniform.  With the uniform.  Those boys from IBM are depending on you to bring those fish.  Hey, he's gotta go with the uniform.  Have some pride.  I'm taking off the uniform to make a delivery.  All right! 
[02:10:00]  And we're gonna kill Lincoln!  Right!  We were doing that all the weekend.  All right!  It really gets Dina and me.  Yeah!  It really fucks Dina and me.  No, it fucks the heck out of Dina and me!  All right!  A little, uh, little known fact about Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Yeah.  You know those two cheerleaders?  Anthony and the Gin, the blonde.  Uh-huh.  And Dina, her friend, that's the brunette.  Yeah.  Guess who that is?  Who?  Bruce Springsteen's younger, uh, sister. 
[02:10:30]  Bruce Springsteen's sister.  Look at that.  A little Fast Times trivia for you.  Look at that.  Someone got the CD, huh?  Yeah.  Someone got the DVD.  My new favorite thing is, uh, with the DVDs is to, to listen to the directors.  Yeah, you listen to the director talk during the whole movie.  Like, you've seen it a thousand times, so it's cool.  So it's on in the background, just a little bit, the volume.  But the director talks and the, uh, some of the actors talk about, uh, parts of the movie.  Right.  It's pretty cool.  It was funny, because there's a scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where they're  walking across the, uh, the front lawn of the school. 
[02:11:00]  And all of a sudden, an extra, like, bumps into, um, uh, uh, uh, help me, the, uh, Jennifer  Jason Lane.  Thank you.  And she's walking with Damone.  And, and the director's just getting all pissed as the scene's starting, going, oh, here's,  here's an overzealous, uh, extra.  And sure enough, the, the, the extra bumps right into her, and she wasn't supposed to.  Wasn't supposed to bump into it.  And I'm thinking, why didn't they just film the scene again?  Because it bugs her 20 years later.  She's like, oh, this girl wrecked this whole scene.  You got any iced tea?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, this is great.  Great iced tea.  He didn't even take his way.  I know.  All right.  Uh, Logan and his wow story from Philly.  Uh, Jerry the King Waller update.  Might have to talk about Memento today.  The DVD came out.  Ah, I saw that over the weekend.  Also want to talk about Silent Hill 2 coming out.  And, uh, talking about games.  Red Faction.  Yeah, we could do a little.  Steve C, turn me on to that one.  We could do a little gaming next.  A little multiplayer.  We haven't done, uh, a gaming break in a while.  Cool.  But first, it's the FU line. 
[02:12:00]  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Yeah, I want to give an FU out to the ground round.  They're shutting me off after six days in the eight Long Island iced tea.  FU.  Next message.  Hey, Rocco and Dave Dickless.  FU.  The radio war is on.  Game on.  Next message.  I want to send a big FU out to Eric Lindros.  Hey, Eric, you don't get to play in Toronto, you big freaking crybaby. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, you get to waste the rest of your career in New York.  Haha, FU.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big FU to my neighbor.  Turn me in for putting up a pool without a building permit.  FU, dickhead.  Pool's up.  I'm enjoying it right now, naked.  And I think your wife is watching me.  Next message.  Hi, I'd like to send a great big FU to Mike in Westchester.  I do not believe that I've wasted a year and a half of my life on you, your f***ing game, your f***ing life.  I am so done.  You are such an a*****.  F*** you. 
[02:13:00]  End of message.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious bemusement and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Filth and smash.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Truly tasteless and not funny.  Ah, Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Give you three guesses where I was Friday. 
[02:13:30]  Here you go.  Paisano?  Very good.  Wow.  You're like Kreskin.  I think I'm as smart as Logan.  There you go.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  All the romance of Italy.  It's a warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  And they serve incredible, authentic Italian cuisine.  I had the, um, what the hell did I have?  Veal.  Veal Marsala.  Nice.  Oh, with a side of ziti sauce.  Wonderful.  Mmm, Paisano.  The portions are huge.  And the pasta lunch specials they got, too, are great. 
[02:14:00]  If you want to take a little time out for lunch.  Ask for Joey, the owner.  You get a glass of wine in the house.  A glass of wine in the house.  What?  And speaking of wine, they have a great wine list, too.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  It's right in the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  Call them up.  965-1188.  965-1188.  They're open seven days a week.  Weekends still to Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Now, the station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York. 
[02:14:30]  And we're back with the O&A show.  In the studio, our buddy Jim Norton.  I think he's actually plugging something today.  It's okay.  It's all right.  We're doing Rascal's West Orange with Gorilla Boy and Rich Voss tomorrow night.  I have to give out the phone number.  It's 973-736-2726.  And not to forget, for those of you in the Poughkeepsie area, this is just going to get 
[02:15:00]  so effed up.  I haven't been in Poughkeepsie in two years, and they're going to be calling West Orange  from Poughkeepsie.  If you're in Poughkeepsie for Friday and Saturday, it's 845-462-3333.  That's four threes.  4-6-2-3-3-3-3-3-3.  You know it's going to be all effed up now.  You know why it might not be?  I'm trying to tell you guys, plug one gig.  Because it's only in different places.  They're in totally different markets, so it might not.  If you live in Jersey, the first one. 
[02:15:30]  If you live in New York, the second one.  I feel bad for the people that, you know, get all confused.  They think they're going to Poughkeepsie to see Jim Norton, but they show up on the wrong  night and see, like, Carrot Top or something.  Ouch.  That would suck.  4-6-2-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3.  Let's make it easy to remember, guys.  3-3-3-3-3.  That's easy.  Hey, I have to bring up something quick.  Yes, Anthony?  You know, after our show here in New York, Ron and Fez come on.  I have a huge problem with a member of Ron and Fez's show. 
[02:16:00]  Al Dukes, the faggot.  The producer guy, whatever it is.  Remember a few weeks back, they got him all drunk and asked him questions about everybody  that works here.  And my name was brought up and he goes, nice guy.  A guy I'd like to go drink him with.  You know why?  Because I really, I don't say much.  I'm pretty quiet.  I'm pretty nice to everybody, right?  Until they F up.  This tool is that guy that, you know, when something good was around, whether it be,  I don't know, a TV, a stereo, or a foosball table, and one douchebag, you'd come in the 
[02:16:30]  next day and it would be broken for some reason.  And you go, well, who did this?  Oh, dickbag did it.  You know, ass, munch, wipe, douche.  He broke it.  So now, like, it's screwed for everyone.  They did something to Al Dukes, I guess, Friday.  Made him kiss a man or something.  I don't know.  Seems to me, knowing him, he'd probably like it.  But he gets all pissed off and I hear he flipped over the foosball table. 
[02:17:00]  Broke the scoring thing on top.  Someone had to fix it.  It's completely out of whack now.  It's not level at all.  It's all screwed up.  Because he has a hissy fit, the foosball table I brought down so we could have fun  during commercials.  I don't need this tool tipping over crap that we have around here for our entertainment.  So now I'm completely pissed off at that douchebag and I don't want to see him.  Why?  He's such a fun guy.  Don't see him.  You know something?  Yeah, fun guy.  Keep him in the effing office and when I leave and go to my office, then he can come out 
[02:17:30]  and come down to the studio.  Oh, you're giving him the Carole Miller treatment.  That's right.  Nice.  And that was totally uncalled for.  I mean, I received oral treats from a tranny and I didn't break anybody's games.  You didn't go breaking people's games.  You didn't break the Pac-Man machine outside.  Not at all.  He's just one of those guys that will ruin crap for everybody.  You know, the foosball table's out there.  Everyone's having fun with it.  We don't care if people from other shows use it. 
[02:18:00]  It's out there for fun.  But there's always one jerk-off that's got to break it or wreck it or something.  And, you know, just chill out.  You're such an asswipe.  There you go.  The Al Douche segment of my rant.  I know why I never said hi to the guy.  You know, I always start off being just a nice guy.  No, I'm serious.  Don't like him and think he's an idiot and will do anything to get his name on the radio.  You know, he's a loser.  A complete and utter loser. 
[02:18:30]  It's not your table to go flipping over, you jerk-off.  We all like playing it during commercials and stuff.  And because of some douchebag like Al Dukes, we're not going to be able to do it?  If he decides to tip it over and snap a leg off it or something?  He wants to be loved so bad he'll do anything for the Ron and Fez show and he's pathetic.  When you have something like that happen, you've got to do it like a man.  You go home, you wash the foul breath off your junk, and you take it like a man.  Right.  Ass.  And was he really that pissed off or do you think he had to make a scene to make sure people didn't think he was... 
[02:19:00]  You know, if you want to make a scene, bust one of the many windows and slit your throat on it.  I heard he tipped it over with his rod.  Or be a real man and go after Ron and Fez if they put you in that position.  You stupid idiot.  You didn't think they were going to, like, trick you and have you kiss a guy, you fag.  Rude and rude.  He ruins other people's equipment.  Great.  Everyone is saying you gave out the wrong phone number. 
[02:19:30]  For which one?  Comedy clubs always stink on this show.  No one can get it right.  What number did I give out wrong?  Let me go to Patrick.  Ah, Patrick.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You gave the Poughkeepsie number.  That's wrong.  I just dialed it.  I live up in Putnam County.  Is it 845-462-3333?  I tried all four of them.  Oh, all four of them.  Then hit dial information.  I stink.  God, am I awful.  Well, sorry if I gave out the wrong number. 
[02:20:00]  West Orange is correct for Tuesday.  Jersey only.  Tuesday.  I told you.  You're right.  I gave out the wrong...  I thought that was the right one.  You're giving out too many dates.  I love when, you know, you have a packed house, but you're confusing everybody.  I know.  No, I just had two in the same week.  I never plug if I can help.  Lewis Black was here once and he gave out the plug.  Oh, I know.  He messed it up so bad that both shows stunk because he said he was going to be at one  place when he was going to be at the other and vice versa.  Some people were showing up to close comedy clubs because they couldn't figure it out.  Call 411.  Just dial information.  I don't want to say 411 because that's probably wrong in Putnam County. 
[02:20:30]  Just dial whatever information is for you and you'll get it.  Mark, what's up?  I was just actually impressed that Patrick could hear the phone number.  You had the music playing for that.  I couldn't hear the number.  All right.  Where is Norton playing next?  I want to test this guy because he's obviously a fan of Norton and wants to see you.  Mark.  Yeah.  Where is Norton playing next?  West Orange.  What day?  That I missed.  I couldn't hear.  Where is he playing?  When is he playing there?  Tomorrow night. 
[02:21:00]  Okay.  This is great.  It's Rascals, right?  Rascals, West Orange, tomorrow night.  All right.  With Jeff Norris and Richard.  All right.  But let's just keep it there for now.  All right.  Okay.  Let's just keep it simple.  Yeah.  Maybe later you can plug in another.  Yeah, you're right.  West Orange, tomorrow.  Let that one just sink in and let people write that down.  We're slow.  Keep it simple.  All right.  That's what you learn in radio, though, when you first start.  Keep it simple.  Keep it to one thought per break.  One thought.  Because they can't digest too much information.  One thought.  You can either talk about the 20 minutes of music you just played or do a contest. 
[02:21:30]  But don't do both.  It's a little too confusing for the listeners.  Swear to God, they teach this crap.  This is what they teach it.  But a lot of them are driving.  Keep it simple, stupid.  Keep it simple, stupid, Rick.  Yeah, you've got to kiss it.  It's the kiss.  Kiss it.  Keep it simple, stupid.  Swear to God, I would be in air check meetings.  Sometimes the program directors, you know, most program directors are program directors  because they weren't good enough to be on the radio.  And then you have to sit in an office with them and play back your show from like the 
[02:22:00]  night before.  And then they criticize you for like two straight hours in their office because they're, you  know, they know how to do a radio show.  Yeah.  And it was always about keep it to one thought.  I noticed in that last break you did weather.  You talked about the music.  You did a contest.  You did a contest and you did some shout outs.  And so it's way too confusing for everybody.  Keep it to one thought.  What about our first meeting with Dave Dickless, our old PD?  Remember that one?  Would that be Dave Douglas at WAF, Anthony?  Yeah.  The station we are slowly but surely destroying in Boston? 
[02:22:30]  Dismantling.  Yes.  Yeah, he's still there.  We moved on.  Remember him, the first meeting?  Gus, I want to talk to you about something, a little something called passion.  And he writes passion on a big note board.  I swear to God.  He didn't write it.  We're in a conference room.  Yeah, he wrote it.  He takes a big marker and writes the word passion.  Was he Alec Baldwin?  We have to be passionate about what we do and what we mean.  Okay, Dave, I am passionate in that I hate you and want to see you dead.  I'm passionate about my hatred towards you. 
[02:23:00]  Program directors are ridiculous.  And he's the one that's going to tell us what people want to hear on the air by writing passion in his multicolored pens that he bought.  You've got to be passionate with your one thought.  Passion.  Why don't you put a picture of somebody cut out of a magazine to represent your audience?  Program directors do this.  Yeah.  Because most guys do their radio show by themselves.  So they can get a little more intimate with their listeners.  They encourage you to bring a picture in and set it up.  Right.  And talk to the picture. 
[02:23:30]  No, they don't.  And they believe it's your audience.  No one would suggest that.  Dude, what about this?  We're sitting in Dave Dickless' office and he goes,  What is, who is your listeners?  Who are they?  And he's got a pen and it's like,  Who are they?  Uh, guys?  Okay, let's write that down.  And he writes it down.  Well, now we're just supposed to,  Guys with shoes!  Guys with shoes!  Guys with pencils!  Hold on before we continue with this. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, Logan.  Yeah?  We're ready for you.  And we even got the wrap from the movie all of a sudden ready to go.  So stay right there, okay?  All right, cool.  We need more wow stories from Philly,  So it's very important to stay.  Hold on.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, so, but then the next question, Anthony, would be,  And how old is this guy?  How old is this listener?  Uh, I don't know, like 27?  27?  Okay, we'll write that down now.  We're building a profile of your listener.  It'll give you help as to who you're talking to.  Now you're going to be able to know, 
[02:24:30]  Well, I don't need help knowing who I'm talking to now.  A big dick!  So tomorrow...  And what kind of car does he drive?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, let's see.  Remember that one?  Yep.  Hmm.  Um, some kind of, uh, like truck made?  Like an SUV?  Or a pickup truck?  Very good, a pickup.  What's the average age of the listener in the audience here?  Average age.  Uh, a bar show?  We can give up flying out.  No, I'm just curious.  Back then it was, you know...  If the numbers are screwed up,  we'll just cut pictures out and put them in the seats at Rascals and talk to them. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, do that.  It might work for you comedians.  Yeah, right.  I think tomorrow there's going to be pictures in the studio of John Wayne Gacy,  Henry Lee Lucas.  Yeah, I know.  You're right.  That's our listeners.  That's our listeners.  Gee.  Okay.  And then it would be, what type of job do they have?  Where do they live?  What suburb?  Who cares, Dave?  This is the stuff that Rocco still has to sit through.  All right, Dave.  Yeah.  Okay, he's like between, I'd say he's 20, 25.  All right.  Yeah, and he's like, he rocks. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  What kind of car does he drive?  I don't know.  If he works here, he can't afford one.  Because you don't pay crap, Dave.  A lot of fun.  Alexis.  Dave.  Hey, I'm Anthony, and I'm crying about my food table.  I'm a baggie.  I'm a baggie.  Shut up.  Hey, I'm going to block my food table. 
[02:26:00]  Mommy?  All right, Alexis.  Maybe you can put a tribute page to the food table on your website.  I'm wearing food ball band as earrings.  As you know, my food ball table passed away over the weekend.  Oh, oh, oh.  I'm wearing handles.  I'm wearing handles in my hair.  And food ball band for earrings.  It wasn't, I don't think I was really crying about it.  I think I was just getting pissed that you have something good, and someone will always 
[02:26:30]  be there to wreck it.  But people don't understand.  If it was anyone else but Al Dukes, I'd be like, oh, well.  All right, blow it off.  Who cares?  The S happens with the guy.  I just don't like that guy.  Tip over something else.  He's so desperate to be loved and wanted.  Yeah.  He's really a pathetic mess.  He's a pathetic, sad mess.  He's the type of guy when, like, you know, you're in a fraternity, you'd make run around  naked and stuff, and you would just abuse them.  Really?  Pee out of them. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, in public.  Just make them do the most ridiculous things, going, don't worry, by the end of this, you'll  be one of us.  And then you make sure at the end, you tell them to go F himself.  Go away.  You know, I can only hope that if he ever does tip the food ball table over again, it  falls and crushes him.  That would be the only way it would work out for the best.  What's he wanted so bad?  Why would you break your friend's game?  I don't get it.  Because he doesn't, it's one of those people that don't think about, like, their actions  or any consequence or anything.  Yeah, it's just a foosball table.  It's not like, oh, man, it's gold-plated or something. 
[02:27:30]  But it's something we like doing during commercials.  We take care of each other because we are a club, and he's just a douche that is on the  outside looking in and wants to be part of this so bad.  And we wouldn't go trashing anything.  I can't wait for them to fire him.  Yeah.  And it will happen.  Uh-oh.  If O puts the word out, it's over.  You know that.  I hope he could get people fired very easily around here.  Shut up.  But, you know, it has nothing to do with it.  It's more about just respecting the other shows and the equipment of the other shows and stuff 
[02:28:00]  than it is a foosball table.  Ken?  I think tonight Al's going to have anal with a guy that was just released from prison just  so he's wanted a little more.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, shucks.  I'm mad that I did that.  Will you maybe invite me out after the show for a beer if I do this?  Okay.  I'll do it.  But can I...  Can he at least wear a condom?  Jeez.  I don't want the hibs.  How many times did he just get his ass kicked in school? 
[02:28:30]  Hey, Ken.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey, Anthony, you going to cremate the foos table and keep it by your side?  I'm cremating it with my bathrobe.  It's Mike and Chester.  You going to make him buy another one?  No.  What are you kidding?  Oh, come on.  No, it still works.  But the thing is, it had to be fixed, and now it's all on a level.  The guy just...  He's not...  He doesn't think. 
[02:29:00]  That's all.  All right, Ken.  You know what?  Fags...  Yeah, fags usually don't.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  Darren, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Norton, you're the best, man.  Thanks, Darren.  No one even caught that Alec Baldwin reference to the movie Glenn Gary when they were talking about  writing passion on the board.  Passion.  Thanks, buddy.  What was the line again, man?  Now I've got to hear it, because I love that movie.  No, there was a movie called...  No, it was called Glenn Gary, Glenn...  Yeah, but what did Norton say?  Oh, when you were talking about your...  Passion. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, the passion with...  Your old guy, and he actually wrote passion on the board.  Yeah, yeah.  What did Norton say, though?  Who was the Alec Baldwin?  He said, what is the Alec Baldwin?  Oh, wow.  Okay.  And that went totally over your guys' heads.  Yeah, big guy.  I just want to say, Norton, you're the best, man.  You're...  Dispickable.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, Darren.  Passion.  We have to have passion.  All right, Anthony, Logan's been on hold in Philly.  He has a wow story.  He's been on hold.  How long, Logan?  I don't know.  I lost count.  How much money you put in the pay phone after your cell phone died?  Um, none.  Oh.  I thought you were... 
[02:30:00]  What, are you using a calling card?  Uh, no.  He had an 800 number.  Oh, yeah.  See, we got an 800 number.  So it's not like money out of his pocket.  Oh, okay.  Right?  All right, well, let's play the...  You went to what?  Jay and Silent Bob, the movie, and something happened outside the theater, right?  Yeah.  Okay, hold on.  Let's play the little rap from the movie here.  One, two.  One, two, three, four.  Noin', noin', noin'.  Smokin' weed, smokin' weirs.  Doin' coke, drinkin' beers.  Drinkin' beers, beers, beers. 
[02:30:30]  Rollin' fatties.  Smokin' bunts.  Who smokes the bunts?  Who smokes the bunts?  Rollin' bunts and smokin' bunts.  Uh, let me get a nickel bag.  Fifteen bucks, little man.  Put that f*** in my hand.  If that money doesn't show, then you owe me, owe me, oh.  I love that little rap.  All right, so, does a car go by otherwise I can't hear you?  What, Logan?  A car's goin' by.  Yeah.  Does a car go on by?  Yeah, I'm in a parking lot next to a liquor store.  All right, we'll put you on hold until that car goes by, all right? 
[02:31:00]  Anthony, we got the Jerry the King Lawler update.  Speaking of pathetic messes...  Can we fit this in before we get out of here?  I sure hope so.  All right.  That and Logan.  All right.  What do you want to play as we go to break here?  I'm going to do a...  Do another F.U. or you want to do another Marion clip?  Let's do a Marion clip.  All right, the Retard Laverne show.  Outside the VMAs.  I got fun for kind of a plane.  Interviewing all the big celebrities.  I'm going to push over the football table.  Oh, let's do the Montel Williams one, where she starts out being a big fan, and then Montel 
[02:31:30]  Williams blows her off, and then she gets really pantsy.  You should only get pantsy.  Nice.  Yeah.  Comedy.  Nice.  Comedy, right.  This one's really good, and we'll be back with Logan's story and the King Lawler update.  Hey, Montel, come here.  I want you to have a couple questions.  Come here.  Come here.  Come on, Montel.  I like your...  Hey, I watch your talk show.  Thanks a lot for dissing me.  I'm not watching it ever again.

[02:33:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony show hanging with Jim Norton today.  All right.  Playing somewhere tomorrow, but we don't know.  We really don't know.  It's a little too confusing for us.  Woo!  He didn't keep it to one thought for a break.  Passion.  Jim, passion.  Passion.  All right, Anthony, we've got a couple options here.  We have a really good wow story from Philly on line two with Logan.  Yeah.  We also have the update about Jerry the King Lawler. 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  Very sad.  What would you like to do?  I'd like to talk a little bit about Lawler.  And then go to Logan?  Then go to Logan.  Okay.  I've been waiting for a long time.  Stinky, the Logan story's really good?  Awesome.  Yeah, definitely is.  Great.  All right.  It could be the showstopper, you say?  Save the best for last kind of thing.  All right, good.  All right, Anthony, our friend Jerry the King Lawler.  Yeah.  Last time he was on our show, it was just so embarrassing.  Oh, my God, you're a pathetic man, Mr. King. 
[02:34:30]  Right.  You know, he talked about he had his little girlfriend there, Cat.  Cat.  And he was huge in the WWF.  Oh, yeah, for many years.  Him and Jim Ross.  Yeah.  Just the best when they're announcing these matches.  Announcers, yeah.  And he let his little head do all the thinking for him.  And the WWF wanted to fire his girlfriend, Cat, who really didn't add much of anything to the WWF except for, you know, a really hot body.  But they got plenty of those, you know.  Yeah.  They come a dime a dozen for the WWF. 
[02:35:00]  For some reason.  They figured, you know, we got to move on and let Cat go.  Right.  What did Jerry the King Lawler do, Anthony?  Said, well, you know, you fire her and I'm gone.  I'll quit.  They said goodbye.  Anyway, that was it.  They fired him.  Well, he quit.  He quit because they were going to fire his girlfriend.  Right.  And he says, if you fire her, you got to fire me.  So he pretty much gave up a lucrative career with the WWF for a woman.  Stupid yet noble.  Noble in a way.  And, you know, it pretty much shows your loyalty toward your chick. 
[02:35:30]  He's been married to her.  He was going out with her for quite a while.  Married how long?  One year.  One year.  Okay.  And one day, this past July, she comes home from a vacation.  Ouch.  You don't let your girl go away on vacation by herself.  Walks up to him and just says, hey, we got to talk.  Oh, my God, King.  This is going to be a hell of a slobber knocker.  And. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  Use it or lose it.  That is still a lame part.  So she leaves him.  She ditches him.  Left him.  He left his job.  His lucrative job with the WWF for her.  For her.  Half a mill a year.  Did he say he was making something crazy like that?  And gone.  Gone.  Loses his wife now because she leaves him for another guy.  Now he's plugging that he's going to be somewhere in Connecticut at some like high school. 
[02:36:30]  It's so sad.  Yeah.  So he's got a website and he does updates from time on time about his situation.  He likes to think the writing is therapeutic.  He says.  He says this situation is so bad because she ended up getting a restraining order that he  doesn't want to come on our show right now unfortunately.  We had him on only what about two weeks ago?  Before any of that stuff hit the news.  You know.  So this is the only way to keep in contact with our friend Jerry the King Waller. 
[02:37:00]  These updates on the website.  Can I read the latest one Anthony?  Let me just add something.  Yeah.  These bitches.  These whore twats.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  With their restraining orders.  Now I'm not even saying this from experience because I never had one taken out on me.  Thank God.  Let me just knock wood.  But a lot of times.  Do you know what you whores.  Do you know what you twats are doing when you take out these restraining orders and they  really aren't.  You shouldn't have done it.  You know the guy didn't do anything.  It's just your way to maybe get back at him or to get an upper hand legally during a 
[02:37:30]  divorce case because these are supposed to be for women that are in danger for their  lives because these men are.  Right.  Real danger.  But it's now being used as some ploy to get an upper hand in front of a judge.  And you know something?  I can't even sympathize now when one of you twats get it right in the friggin' head because  you're all because you dug your own goddamn grave with the legal system the way it is.  Nine restraining orders.  Yeah.  Guerrilla boys have nine. 
[02:38:00]  He's a case of someone I say yes.  Slap one on his ass.  One more I go to Disney.  He is dangerous.  And six of those are men.  But you know if you legitimately need one fine.  I think they should be enforced and they're a very helpful thing.  But these women that just take them out because your lawyer said to.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Die getting a cough in your whore.  There you go.  Very good answer.  I am having one taken out against douchebag Al Dukes. 
[02:38:30]  And my foosball table.  Al.  Hey Al.  You're going to get a tattoo so you feel loved?  Are you going to get a tattoo of Ronnie on your right ass and Fezzy on your left ass?  And then make like you're all pissed off about it?  But you really think it's great because you were involved for a day?  Oh man.  And if you think there's a radio bed just watch when we pass each other in the hall.  Look in our eyes and see how real it is you pathetic loser who wants to be loved. 
[02:39:00]  Go get a tattoo.  Go get a tattoo of your favorite radio personality.  There you go.  You made out with a guy and you couldn't handle it.  So you effed with us.  God I hate that kid.  I will laugh so hard the day Ronnie comes in our office and goes.  How to fire him.  How to fire him.  Still love the Ronnie Fez. 
[02:39:30]  No he doesn't have a tattoo of the fabulous sports babe on his butt because it wouldn't.  It wouldn't have to.  Anthony so the update.  Yes.  Alright here's Jerry the King Lawler in his words.  First of all I must apologize for the long time between updates.  I'm sorry.  But unfortunately there has been a lot on my plate as of late.  Man I just thought my life changed back in February when the WWF fired my wife Stacy.  A.K.A. Kat.  And then I quit my job with the WWF in protest.  But that change paled in comparison to the changes that started on July 1st when Stacy. 
[02:40:00]  A.K.A. Kat.  Told me she was leaving me.  As most of you know I tried to document my situation here on my website.  In the updates I wrote I poured my heart out about our breakup.  I did that for a few reasons.  One to keep the fans advised about what was going on in my life.  Two I found writing about what I was experiencing was almost therapeutic.  Therapeutic.  And that it allowed me a chance to talk to someone.  Even if it were through the computer.  Because in reality I was alone.  With no one to share my feelings with. 
[02:40:30]  And three I admit that I wrote what was in my heart hoping that Stacy.  A.K.A. Kat.  Would read it and have a change of heart herself.  Yeah.  Oh man.  The begging phase.  Ah pooh ha.  This guy's a wrestler.  Don't expect this from a wrestler.  I thought she'd have a change of heart.  I bowed to him for the stuff he did with Andy Kaufman and all that.  I love Jerry Lowe.  And one of the greatest wrestling announcers ever.  I love him.  And this chick just screwed him over and he was stupid enough. 
[02:41:00]  Hoping that she would think that if I would bare my soul and tell the world how I felt  about her it would make her see how much I really loved her.  No I think she's too busy looking at another man's junk to read your website.  She's too busy.  Maybe she could read if she didn't have another man's yam bag over her eyeballs and the shaft  down her nose like the Roman war helmet.  Perhaps then she would have been able to read it if she didn't have male junk in her face.  You just gotta move on man.  Sometimes it hurts but you know you gotta move on for God's sake. 
[02:41:30]  Move it along.  Move it along.  And don't spill it like I'm off.  He's writing like pretty much love letters to her on his website.  And you know all the fans are just like laughing like Cartman.  He'll get a hot girl out of that though.  Because they see him as a sensitive guy.  Some smoking 19 year old 10 will start banging her.  We're gonna get him late on this show.  He's gonna come in when everything is settled and we're gonna get him a banging.  We'll get him a banging.  An Opie and Anthony banging.  Good.  Maybe we'll have Al Dukes do it.  He can just tip the chick over right before Lawler dumps. 
[02:42:00]  Get his seed all over him.  He'll put Al Dukes in a wig.  He'll do it.  Of course he will.  Be part of something.  He wants to be loved.  He'll do that type of radio.  But at last it was to no avail.  Cat is not coming back.  We are now in the midst of a divorce proceedings.  And of course that is never pleasant.  There was a lot of talk about wanting to be on her own.  And make her own decisions in my last updates.  But the truth is Stacy has a new man in her life.  I wish them well.  They deserve each other. 
[02:42:30]  Stacy has asked that all things concerning her be removed from my wedding.  He's a stalker too.  And that is being done as you read this.  She has also asked that I not make any disparaging remarks about her on my website.  I am not going to say anything bad about Stacy.  We had a great time together.  And it really is like the Garth Brooks song.  I could have missed the pain.  But I would have had to miss the dance.  I could have missed the pain.  But I would have had to see. 
[02:43:00]  There you go.  And believe me the dance with Stacy was wonderful.  I hope that when this divorce is done Stacy and I could still be friends.  But that is yet to be seen.  That will never happen.  You know what song he should be quoting?  Hey Joe.  You're right.  Whenever lawyers get involved, things have a tendency to get out of hand.  So that is where I am today.  Trying to move forward while waiting to be divorced.  Hoping to meet someone new to share my life with.  While continuing to make appearances and wrestling dates. 
[02:43:30]  And he lists all his dates.  And they are too embarrassing to mention, Anthony.  I have received so many emails of encouragement.  And hope from you great fans and friends.  And I have received so many emails of encouragement.  And hope from you great fans and friends.  And I thank you for each and every one of them.  Many of you have suggested that I try to return to the WWF.  Now that Stacy is no longer in the equation.  You ready for this?  Yeah.  I called Bruce Pritchard at the WWF last week to try to mend some of the fences. 
[02:44:00]  That has been damaged by my remarks about Bruce during my ordeal.  Bruce was very gracious.  He wasn't upset or angry and didn't hold any grudges.  We talked for a long time about many things.  One of them being my returning to the WWF.  And finally, Bruce suggested that I call Vince personally.  I told him I would.  The next day I called good old JR.  And we talked for a long time as well.  I always enjoy talking to JR.  And I value his opinion and advice.  JR's advice, Anthony?  Yeah.  JR's advice to me was to concentrate on my business at hand. 
[02:44:30]  Meaning my divorce from Stacy.  Get that finalized and behind me.  And then talk to Vince about coming back.  I think he is right.  The only way he'll wrestle again is on PlayStation.  And divorce is a very serious thing.  And needs your full attention if you intend to protect your own best interest.  And that is what I intend to do.  I was encouraged by my conversations with Bruce and JR.  And I hope that someday soon I can be back with the WWF in some capacity.  Man.  And then it goes on and on.  But unfortunately we're running out of show here.  So.  What?  He's a pussy.  He is a pussy.  Nah.  Nah, he's not. 
[02:45:00]  He's a guy that's got burned by a chick.  Yeah, he got burned.  But you know something?  Yeah, but the more you dwell on it, then you look like a bigger pussy to new girls you meet.  Then you start doing comedy and beat up somebody in the studio.  The only reason he's writing stuff like this is still the hopes of getting her back in some way, shape, or form.  He hasn't accepted it yet.  That's why he's saying, I hope after this is all over we can still be friends.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  The more you chase, the more restraining orders you get hand delivered. 
[02:45:30]  Believe me.  You start getting sticker pushes in your ass, you can't do nothing about it.  You just want to.  She must have been some.  Yeah, she must have had.  Well, she was really young.  That's the deal.  I mean, he has to be at least 50-something.  And she was probably no more than 25, 26.  Liquid gold from that cash.  But yeah, you just, you know, you got to move on.  All right.  He can't be doing this on websites hoping that someday she's going to go, oh, I made a mistake.  They're going to have him on soon. 
[02:46:00]  I'm where I hope.  Rent the car and cut her off the road.  You know what?  You can hope that someday she comes back and says, oh, I made a big mistake.  But by that point, she's just a crag whore.  Yeah, you got a 19-year-old.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's a crag whore.  That would be great.  All right.  Let's end the show with Logan from Philadelphia.  He has a really good wow story.  He called up at about 4 o'clock.  Yeah, about 3.45 or so.  Sure.  It's been on hold a long time, but a lot of our listeners are on hold a long time. 
[02:46:30]  About three hours or so.  I don't know how long.  Long time, man.  Thanks, though.  What have you been doing this whole time?  Wishing that I had Jack Daniels with me.  Yeah, all right.  Well, let's hear your story.  All right.  Last night, me and my friend, Adam, and my lesbian friend, Hannah, go to see, um...  Oh!  Oh, my God.  None more code.  Oh, my God.  There's a guy waiting.  Is this cat?  Hang up.  That cat?  That's always funny.  Yeah, that's cat.  Wow. 
[02:47:00]  Is that really cat?  Yeah.  I'd chase her, too.  All right.  Listen, we got to go.  Holy smoke.  We got to go.  Norton, you got to give the plug really fast.
