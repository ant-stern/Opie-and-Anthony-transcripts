<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a raucous, profanity-laced critique of an unspecified video or media piece.  Sam Robertson and E-Rock provided a running commentary filled with vulgar jokes and derogatory descriptions.  Around the 3:30 mark, Jason Ellis and Mike Tully joined via phone from Los Angeles.  The conversation then shifted to Ellis's past experiences on the show, his negative encounter with Jim Jefferies, his rise to fame, and further devolved into graphic sexual humor, including detailed descriptions of childbirth and Ellis's MMA career. The hosts also discussed the prevalence of herpes in New York City.  A segment featuring porn star Belladonna followed.  A frequent caller, Big A, described as a "stuttering, muttering prick," was brought into the studio for a bizarre, highly sexualized interview with Belladonna, filled with crude jokes and graphic descriptions of her adult films, including "double fisting." Big A even attempted to create a fictional porn scenario involving himself and Belladonna.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about Paulo, a contributor to *The Ron and Fez Show*, and his film *Gap*.  This segment started with a discussion about sexually aggressive language during sex before briefly featuring a promotional spot by Bella Donna.  The main focus turned to a review of *Gap*, a low-budget, experimental horror film. Paulo, the film's writer, director, and star, was in studio, along with Sam and Louis C.K. (who was involved in the filmâ€™s creation). They critiqued *Gap*'s poor editing, amateur cinematography, unconvincing violence, and awkward acting.  Clips from the film were shown and analyzed, with much laughter and commentary, frequently focusing on the unconvincing violence and poor camera work. There was much debate about whether *Gap* was "so bad it's good" or just objectively terrible. The conversation was filled with frequent interruptions, off-topic comments, and profanity.  Jimmy Norton also participated, seemingly defending the film, though he fell asleep during the viewing. Paulo attempted to defend the film, calling it "controversial" and a "fulcrum for discussion," and promoted the film's website, GapTheMovie.com.  This segment also included a disastrous first broadcast of "The Dave and Bobo Show," featuring Intern David and a caller named Bobo, highlighting awkward interactions and hostile callers aggressively criticizing David's interviewing skills.  The conversation further veered into discussions about Rihanna and Chris Brown, and Sam and E-Rock's experiences at Big Apple Comic Con, including E-Rock's obsession with toys and the high prices for celebrity autographs and photos.

A significant portion of the show covered Sam's Comic-Con experiences.  This included discussion of unexpectedly short lines for celebrities like Mickey Dolenz, Virgil, Eddie Furlong, Tom Wopat, and Ernie Hudson, contrasted with surprisingly long lines for props like the Batmobile and DeLorean. The lack of a Ted DiBiase appearance was also lamented.  The segment included numerous disparaging remarks about the celebrities' declining popularity.  Sam's Comic-Con interviews were played, featuring individuals in various costumes (Iceman, Conan the Barbarian, the Goblin King, the Joker), with often awkward improvisational attempts to stay in character.  The hosts and Sam offered frequent, crude commentary. One interviewee even claimed his girlfriend was She-Hulk. The segment concluded with a discussion of a bee infestation at a GameStop and a bizarre anecdote about a bee removal service run by a man named Ted, who claimed to have been stung 4,000 times.  Finally, the hosts briefly discussed Opie's unsuccessful fly fishing trip with Bob Kelly.

The show also featured two segments focused on Opie's fly-fishing trip with Bob Kelly and Bob's unique eating habits. The fly-fishing segment highlighted the small number of fish caught, Opie's disdain for the sport, and their guide's perceived shortcomings, interweaving this with jokes about Bob's smoking, weight, and Opie's relationship troubles. Reed, a caller, defended the sport. Bob later called in, defending his catch and recounting a near-accident.  Their subpar motel accommodation was also described. The second segment focused on E-Rock's reaction to eating Sam's dad's unusual meal: raw potatoes, sardines, onions, garlic pickles, and buttermilk. E-Rock's disgust and discomfort were the main focus, culminating in him nearly vomiting.  The hosts compared this to "Fear Factor," highlighting how much worse it was. The show concluded with promotions for upcoming shows.

[00:02:30]  Get real.  I'm in love with seahorses.  I'm in love with them.  They're so beautiful and cute.  I'm in love with the seahorses.  They're fucking unreal.  I love them.  They're like all the clocks.  I love them.  I love seahorses.  And I love looking at them.  And I love seashells.  I love seashell things.  I love things with seashells and seahorses on them.  Like blankets.  And towels.  And little bags.  I love them.  Seahorses.  Forever.  Hey, it's Jim Brewer, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's show, hosted 
[00:03:00]  by primetime Sam Robertson, E-Rock.  Get him, slugger.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  And I am primetime Sam Robertson.  And this year was a lot of firsts.  A lot of firsts.  Besides celebrity deaths, it was a lot of firsts.  You lost your virginity.  No, that is not true.  Okay, well, one day it will happen.  No, it won't.  All right.  You're probably right.  I tried paying.  It doesn't work.  Aw.  This is a year of firsts.  This is when we had a new addition to the Virus Channel.  Yes.  E-Rock.  No, I've been here.  Oh.  I've actually been here longer than you. 
[00:03:30]  Really?  People don't pay attention.  People don't.  No, I'm talking about Jason Ellis.  That's right.  The first time Jason Ellis was in studio along with Jim Jeffries, who I guess didn't...  A fellow Aussie.  Yeah, and Jeffries didn't quite go along with his brand of...  What's...  E-Rock.  No, don't do this.  I'm getting something in my head.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  Oh, somebody wants to join us from L.A.  Ah, it's Mike Tully and Jason Ellis live from Faction in Los Angeles.  Jason and Mike, can you hear us?  You want me to fucking talk?  Who's this?  That's what you want to use?  Thank you, Sam and E-Rock. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, what's up?  I'm Jason Ellis.  In New York City.  I love Sam.  I'm a big E-Rock fan.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  Like, is he a dancer?  I think he used to be.  Right.  You remember the Fly Girls?  Yeah, you'd probably still get laid with E-Rock.  I think he's got like a medallion or something?  I would hope so.  Good for him.  You can put Rock in your name if you're not Rockin'.  You can.  You better not.  Sometimes people put Big in their name and they're not big.  You can only do that if you're incredibly small.  In Australia, redhead dudes are called Blue. 
[00:04:30]  Really?  Yeah.  What's with Australia?  I don't know.  That's why I moved here.  I get you.  Anyway.  So they are in New York City.  Good for them.  Sam and E-Rock.  It's a hell of a town.  That's where everybody has herpes.  That's right.  Meanwhile, here in Los Angeles.  Do we have the stats on Los Angeles?  AIDS.  We're a big AIDS state.  It's always been a West Coast thing.  Big fan.  Go AIDS.  Exactly.  Sun, surf, punch IV.  Yeah.  So, Jason, do you recall the first time you were on the Opie and Anthony show? 
[00:05:00]  I totally recall that.  As if it were yesterday.  It was like it was yesterday.  I remember that there was an Australian dude on there who was fucking annoying the shit out of me.  I think the feeling was mutual.  Yeah.  Well, that happens.  His name is Jim Jeffries.  Yeah, he can suck a cock.  Okay.  Yeah, I wasn't in the studio.  Right.  And I did feel a little weird that day.  You know when you just don't have it?  Yes.  I didn't have it.  I have a deal with that almost every day.  Right.  I was like, man, what a bad time to not have it because it's the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:05:30]  and these people are fucking Megatron and they're giving you a chance.  I just showed up to the World Series without my fastball.  Yeah, you're sucking a dog dick right now on the radio and then some Aussie dude's fucking  making every now and then a little fucking interesting fucking point about nothing.  But I should have just shut up and let him talk.  Nonetheless, this clip remains a classic.  Does it?  And that's why they're going to play it now.  Maybe that Aussie dude shredded it up and was hilarious.  Jason Ellis debuts on Opie and Anthony via ISDN from Los Angeles.  Australian comedian Jim Jeffries is in the studio. 
[00:06:00]  As ONA are getting to know him and promote his show coming to the virus,  Jim is put off by Jason's personality.  Oh, really?  Yes.  That's what's about to happen.  Right.  Well, I'll fight that guy.  Is he undefeated in the amateur boxing and professional mixed martial arts ring?  Isn't he the guy that got beat up?  He did get beat up.  He's a bitch.  He cowed like a bitch, too.  He went down into the fetal position.  Fetal.  Don't even come at me.  Like a baby.  Yeah, you go fetal on a motherfucker. 
[00:06:30]  Don't be coming to me with anything.  Shut the fuck up and go home.  Fetal.  I don't go into the fetal for a fucking, like, an elephant.  I'd at least fucking give it a kick.  You know what I mean?  You went fetal on a fucking drunk fan.  Ridiculous, Michael.  Ridiculous.  Absolutely absurd.  Why am I even on here right now explaining, nobody should play this.  Jim Jefferies is a fucking tool bag.  He's a baby.  He's an infant.  He's a diaper-wearing comedian. 
[00:07:00]  What a fucking baby.  Somebody fucking burp this little bitch.  Jim Jefferies.  Is he rich yet?  I doubt it.  Right.  Good.  Is this it?  Yes.  It's the worst of 2009.  Where's Jason Ellis?  He doesn't talk about John and Kate Plus 8 on his radio show, does he?  No.  Jason.  I've never heard of the bitch.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  I've never heard of the bitch.  How's it going?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  We got in studio Jim Jefferies, who's from Australia. 
[00:07:30]  Hello, mate.  How are you?  Oh, God.  I feel like I'm talking to my mom right now.  What the fuck's going on here?  You moved out of Australia when you were 14 years old.  You have a thicker accent than me, you bastard.  How does that work?  I left when I was 17, and I'm talking to you, like me, and you, but then I'll go back  to Opie and Anthony so that the world can understand me.  Yeah, it is bizarre.  We just said things then to each other that you wouldn't even know.  There were subplots.  I know.  I asked him on a date, and he said, go fuck yourself. 
[00:08:00]  It's a secret language.  I feel like I got Jim Jefferies' clone on the phone.  We just think it's an accent, but it is a secret language.  Yeah.  I feel like there's an echo going on.  Chicks dig it, though, man, this voice.  They do dig it.  It's ridiculous how much they want to bone you.  You know what else?  Oh, go ahead.  I heard you talking about kangaroos, and I realized that you can just say anything you  want if you're Australian in America, and everybody believes it.  Oh, they don't even exist.  Oh, yeah, dinosaur kangaroos.  They grow like it.  That's true. 
[00:08:30]  They're about fucking 20 feet higher.  There was dinosaur kangaroos.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, my mom's got one in her backyard.  Oh, we do.  We just eat that shit up.  Really?  He said it with that accent.  It's got to be true.  I am partial to lying.  It's true.  Did you know that ACDC's lyrics came from a dinosaur kangaroo?  It was red.  Sure, they have one.  They still have one.  12 feet tall.  Yeah, we just believe it because it sounds Australian.  Oh, come on.  I told a story about drop bears where they were like feral koala bears, and they would  drop out of trees on your face and mole people. 
[00:09:00]  My dad used to say the drop bears.  That was a myth.  Drop bears.  If you weren't strong enough, they could actually kill you.  Like, if you couldn't get them off your face in time, they might slash your jugular or something.  And that story came back to me drunk at a bar like 10 years later.  Do you know about drop bears?  No, my dad told us about drop bears.  You idiot.  I made it up.  That's a standard thing, drop bears.  Really?  My father would tell us about drop bears so we'd look up at trees and shit.  They sound like huge fuzzy head crabs from Half-Life.  You know, they're actually really terrifying.  I think, yeah.  Your wife had another kid, right? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, humongous baby out of her vagina.  The doctor had to cut her vagina in front of me.  I watched the scissors go into the beave and cut it open.  I don't want to bang her.  She's not listening right now.  It was a drop baby.  It dropped out on his head and started mauling the doctor.  I always find that funny.  You know what?  He came out the same size as the fucking koala.  He's a beast.  He came out humongous.  When my brother had his kid, his wife had the baby.  Same thing.  They cut the cunt open.  The baby falls out, right? 
[00:10:00]  Do you know Australians are the only people that can say cunt correctly?  Cunt.  Oh, yeah, cunt.  It's not offensive if we say it.  When you say it, it's like, whoa, dude.  Is it really impossible?  We say the chicks fucking punch us and leave the house immediately.  You guys saying it's like, it's so endearing.  Fuck me.  But they cut the baby out and they go, you're not to have sex with her for six weeks.  And he's like, well, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because I was so desperate to fuck that.  Yeah, I was really good.  He said at the end it looked like Apollo Creed's face when he was killed in Rocky IV. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, wow.  Thanks a lot for putting that in there.  That's cool.  Jason, so your first child, they didn't have to do it, but his name's Tiger, right?  Your son's name is Tiger.  Tiger Lee Ellis, recognize.  Nice.  And you had to watch this.  It's not named after that fucking retarded golf player.  I can assure you of that.  Get a real sport, bitch.  That's got to be pretty fucked up to see that live.  My father-in-law was like, hey, man, guess what?  Tiger came back to play golf after hurting himself the same day Tiger was born. 
[00:11:00]  I'm like, what the fuck would you tell me that for?  Fuck golf.  Fuck that guy.  Useless.  When he injured himself playing golf, fuck off.  You injured yourself smoking a fucking pole, you useless prick.  My God.  Golf injury.  Jesus.  Good point.  Good point.  I shattered my wrist and had pins in it, and my doctor's like, do you know how many golf  players I have in here?  And I was like, no.  I don't have any.  And I was like, what the fuck does that mean?  He's like, figure it out.  I'm like, oh, fuck you. 
[00:11:30]  Fuck doctors.  Fuck golf.  Fuck all you mother-pussies.  Break something and fucking live your life, you homo.  And then you decide, you're in your, what, mid-30s?  Because I think you're talking about it here.  37.  37.  You decide to pick up some MMA crap recently, right?  Yeah.  You had your first fight?  Yeah, my first pro fight, like, was it a month ago?  Yeah.  Yeah, just under a month.  I won.  I'm undefeated.  Yeah, you knocked the dude out in the first round, right?  No, that was my, I had an amateur boxing fight about three months ago, and I knocked 
[00:12:00]  that dude out in 90 seconds, and then this is an MMA fight, which is mixed martial arts.  I heard you guys talking about it.  It's always been called mixed martial arts.  UFC just made it look like Ultimate Fighter, because they're the big organization of America.  Hey, you've got a lot of your fans calling right now.  The LL Cool J interview, this is one I have no idea about.  So I don't know what I'm getting into, but they said you've got to mention LL Cool J to  Jason Ellis.  Yeah, he was on the show.  So, like, he was in New York, and I was here, and somebody said, hey, man, LL's going to 
[00:12:30]  be on your show in five minutes.  I was like, you mean LL Cool J, the rapper dude?  And they were like, yeah.  And I was like, okay, that's weird.  And then my boss said to me, right before I went in the studio, I'm sure you guys have  dealt with this.  That's the thing I wanted to talk to you about, but we'll get into that later.  Yeah.  My boss says, just so you know, Will is, I'm sorry, LL Cool J is good friends with the  big boss at Sirius, and when he's done with your show, he's going to walk into that office 
[00:13:00]  and talk to that guy.  And I'm like, what does that mean?  I'm not saying it means anything.  I'm just saying that's what he's going to be doing after the interview.  And I was like, that's weird, because I don't really, you know what I mean, I'll fuck with  people, but usually if it's a celebrity, I know what you got.  You know, they need to be pampered.  Oh, you're so fucking glorious.  Fuck you.  When's your album coming out?  I know that bullshit, so I've never really said anything too bad, but straight off the  bat, this dude starts coming at me, because he misunderstood me.  I said he was like the prince of hip-hop, because he was getting a, his last record was on a 
[00:13:30]  certain record label.  I could care less, man.  I never thought he was good anyway.  But he's, you know, I said something about you, you're like the prince of hip-hop, except  you don't have arseless pants.  And he thought I, that he, I was saying that he had arseless pants.  No, dog, no dog, you are.  You, you're the one in the garage with your arseless pants, motherfucker.  I'm like, what?  What's going, you get these balls, and I was like, get, get, get your balls?  You're pissed at me, you want me to get your balls? 
[00:14:00]  Like, what's up with that?  So now, I gather he went to the boss after this great conversation.  I haven't been fired.  Well, yeah, I mean, you know.  I'm still here.  If he's listening, I'm still here.  And nobody's listening to your album, you steaming pile of shit.  Why don't you do another episode of Project Runway, you washed up motherfucker.  He's got a little of everything.  He was in Mall Cop.  You got your own band. 
[00:14:30]  Taint Stick.  Taint Stick.  Recognize.  Recognize the Taint Stick.  The show today is actually groundbreaking.  A new song.  I'm actually not.  Yeah, fuck it.  I'll tell it.  A new song that no one's ever heard ever before is going to debut on the Jason Ellis Show today.  And it's all about my truck that I have, which is very riveting, I'm sure you can imagine.  A song about a truck.  Yeah, it's my truck.  A country song?  No.  No.  It's a matter.  We're sort of a metal comedy band, but we're very serious.  The only thing that stops me from being really committed to it is, as I said before, I dropped 
[00:15:00]  a bunch of loads in my wife's carnival, and there's no fucking coming back.  Yeah.  Yeah, that baby.  Because now the radio show is getting better, and I get a lot of girls like, hey, hey, I'm  like, cool.  I have two kids.  You want to blow me?  Awesome.  Yeah, that works out fucking sweet now, doesn't it?  Motherfucker.  I got nothing.  I wake up fucking seven times a night.  Fucking bitches want to blow me now? 
[00:15:30]  Shit.  I hate it, man.  MySpace, hey, hey, hey.  I won't even click on it anymore.  I have direct ones where they say, hey, hey, hey.  I'm like, wow, that's actually you.  That's what you're saying.  So I can fuck you.  I can do you.  I can do all of you and your friends.  Hey, I heard you talking about threesomes.  I've got a friend who'll fuck you.  Great.  Cool.  I'm just going to go burp a baby.  And then I'll be right back.  Fuck.  I'm going to go watch a human come out and rip my wife's uterus in half and know that that's 
[00:16:00]  the only uterus that I'll be touching ever again.  And you and your friends all want to blow me?  Sweet.  Can't wait to fucking go home.  You've got the worst timing.  You should have started this radio thing in your early 20s.  I know, but I didn't know I was that funny.  Yeah, you're pretty funny.  You're very funny, actually.  What else are you doing on the show today, Jason?  Record deals and talking about a baby coming out of my wife's vagina and debuting a new  song.  Oh, wait.  Tell me I'll do that.  Is this your first live show since having the kid? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm back.  I'll be checking it out today then.  Cool.  Yeah, I'm going to talk about you guys and how we're now like the Wonder Twins, except  we're not gay.  What's a good one?  We're like Birdman.  You're Birdman.  Yeah.  And I'm that fucking eagle.  And when the sun's out, we're going to fucking fly out of a cave and fuck everybody up.  It's going to be awesome.  It could be like that.  I'm going to start learning how to sound like an eagle.  And make sure you trash Jim Jefferies on your show today, too. 
[00:17:00]  Fuck Jim Jefferies.  Guys are steaming pilots.  Who is Jim Jefferies anyway?  What the fuck?  It's me and ACDC.  Fuck everybody else.  That's the only Australians allowed.  Yeah, Jefferies is taping his HBO special Saturday night.  What's the Australian ever doing?  Yeah, we're tired.  A funny guy from Australia.  Wow.  He must really burn a lot of whores.  He's fucking hilarious.  Wow, that is a weird...  Are you having herpes?  No, actually no.  I was working on it.  Every now and again I think I've got them and the doctor just says it's like a rash. 
[00:17:30]  Speaking of herpes, Brent Michaels admitted to you that he has herpes?  One and two, motherfuckers.  He said one.  I said herpes.  He said one and two.  He goes one and two.  Is that two grains of herpes?  No, that means mouth and pee-pee.  Oh, I got the mouth.  Every time he watched that show and he makes out with those chicks like...  Holy shit.  I can't watch now.  Now the show becomes really entertaining because he does it to everybody with his 50-year-old...  He's a nasty-ass motherfucker. 
[00:18:00]  I actually like the guy but he's the most grotesque individual ever and he will like...  He has that weird...  You know, because he puckers up so he looks good in the photo.  He looks like a girl from the 80s.  You know, that whole thing he does?  Yeah.  He does that when he makes out with them so he's like...  And just drops herpes all over everybody.  There's no remorse here.  He made out with like a 22-year-old the other day.  He's like...  Welcome to herpes.  Fucks her life up and anyone she fucks.  He gave her herpes all over her face and then fucking booted her off the show. 
[00:18:30]  Like, thanks a lot.  Here's a little token of...  You can only give them if you've got them at this stage.  You can still fuck a chip when you do it.  That's a complete lie.  That's a complete lie because I also do sex stuff on my show about...  Because like I said, I care.  I care.  But herpes, when you're not showing with a condom on, you can still get herpes.  Terrify yourself on that.  And did you know that where you are, 25% of you have herpes?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, just about everyone.  Don't fuck anybody in New York, dude.  Come back over here.  Most people have herpes. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, right.  I'd rather say...  No, New York has more herpes than anyone in New York.  I'd rather say 75% don't.  There you go.  I'm more the herpes.  Those are three-quarter empty.  Right.  All right.  Hey, we've got to let you go, man.  Jason, it was a pleasure.  Hey, thanks for letting me on there, man.  Cool, Jason.  Remember, non-boner dick tattoos on our asses.  Right.  When I come to New York, let's do it.  Let's do it in a church.  No shit.  It's a joke.  That was a joke.  Team virus.  Team virus.  Team virus.  Yeah, way to hurt us.  Thanks. 
[00:19:30]  Way to remind us of that nightmare.  All right.  You'll be all right.  Hey, we'll talk to you soon.  All right, Jason?  All right, man.  All right.  Later, boss.  Peace.  Jason Ellis, everyone.  He's the real deal.  I really enjoy his show.  That was exhausting, though.  Now I need a nap.  I know.  Guy could talk.  That's how we used to be at AAF.  What?  All hyper?  Just AAF.  Before we got better.  See what you got to look forward to, Jason?  Bitterness.  Bitter.  Bitterness.  He was asking. 
[00:20:00]  He's getting kicked around.  Right.  It's all fun.  Everything's new to him.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Wait till the bosses beat you down for a decade.  They're fucking physically brow beaten.  Right.  Ass raped.  Wait till your first contract negotiation.  Right.  You got so many firsts in your career.  Wait till they take every great bit you came up with and tell you why you can't do it anymore.  They just pick.  You know what it is?  Sit there and let them pick your soul away.  Your very soul. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Until there's nothing left of what was you.  Oh, yeah.  And then there.  You've made it.  There's going to be no more pink punching you in the face.  Yeah.  Because that's not cool.  Especially you punching her.  That ain't happening.  Yeah.  In another year.  LL Cool J trashing him.  No.  Never going to happen.  That won't happen.  Because he's going to be involved with something that matters.  That you can't talk about because it's that and this.  It's refreshing to hear somebody all with that much energy in the business and that much  faith and just thinking that naive thinking that it's all going to go great and stuff. 
[00:21:00]  Believe me, he sounds very good.  I bet he'll be very successful.  But by the time you get everything you want, you're an empty shell of a man.  And that's why he sounds like we're used to.  Yes.  Is he still here?  He's done, man.  Oh, thank fuck for that.  Bloody hell.  I have never heard of you.  I was homesick about 50 minutes ago. 
[00:21:30]  I was homesick.  And now I don't want to visit the country ever again.  What's wrong, Jim?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  We're going to punch someone in the fucking hand of the thing.  And my wife's fucking snatch has just been coming.  And the baby fell out.  It's a fucking thing.  That's what he does.  Oh, my God.  And you're a fan opening.  He is shit.  That guy is fucking shit.  He didn't say one fucking funny thing.  He didn't let anyone fucking get in.  He just mouthed off about everything. 
[00:22:00]  And you're a fan.  You Aussies cannot get along.  That's why you're not a superpower.  That's why you're not a superpower.  I just went into the office and said, I'm not going to say, I've got to walk away.  This guy is fucking true.  You should have said it to his face.  He was, I couldn't get a word in.  Try to say it to his face.  He would have told me that he punched some guy in the karate using a fucking known form of martial art.  You know, son, we were just talking about, though, this is how you are at the beginning of your radio career.  If you listen to early tapes of us, I think you've been in those shows. 
[00:22:30]  We're full of piss and vinegar.  It's like, yeah, we're in radio, man.  This is it.  And then as time goes by and your bosses and the business suck the fucking life force out of you,  then you end up like this, where you're just like, yeah, just fuck everything.  To all the listeners out there, if I'm halfway through a crossword, that's how fucking much I've never done a crossword and I'm not even good at them. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I saw that you changed halfway through that.  I just went, oh, fuck this.  I'm not.  Fuck.  Fuck this.  I love that.  Fuck this.  Yeah, I like Jason Ellis.  I like his radio show.  I'm sure he's going to show five, but I'm really glad.  I haven't heard so many.  I'm a swearer.  I love a good swearer.  Don't get me wrong.  He was selling himself to a whole new audience.  You know what?  And I think that's what one of the callers was going to get to, but fuck it.  I'm going to just comment on this.  When he's at the point where he's playing old tapes of himself and juice chilling out, perhaps we'll be in that montage. 
[00:23:30]  He's just so full of vim and vigor and energy, and that goes away, and it just, I hope, I can only hope the bosses shit on you enough that you can have a career just like we've had.  Success?  Sure.  That part of it's fun. 
[00:24:00]  It's exciting.  You get to get things you want.  You know, it was very nice when I paid my credit cards off, and I would look at something in the store and go, I could just buy that.  But then you realize they've taken my very soul from me.  The bosses have taken my soul.  Oh, I enjoy my fucking, my life.  I enjoy my car.  I enjoy everything.  But there's part of me that I listen to in my early tapes that's dead. 
[00:24:30]  It's the worst of the year, 2009 countdown.  For the Opie and Anthony Show with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, it's not often that we get porn stars in the studio, and when we do, most of the time we don't really like them.  We're doing it as a favor because it's some connection Steve had.  But in this case, yeah, it's usually a gay porn star that he suggests.  But in this case, Belladonna came by, and we do like her.  She was one of the best porn stars we've ever had in studio, and she didn't even do anything, like, overtly sexual.  She was barely even naked. 
[00:25:00]  She just talked.  She ended up giving Opie her panties to give to his brother-in-law, which was very nice of her.  Yes.  But, yeah, I mean, she gave all kinds of stories, advice, just very honest, awesome person.  Plus, we found out a friend of ours is really into Belladonna.  Big A himself, old friend of the show, this stuttering, muttering prick, came by and interviewed Belladonna for a little while.  Yeah, he was trying to win her affection. 
[00:25:30]  Woo her is what he was trying to do.  Did he or didn't he?  He did not.  Correct.  And if you don't believe Iraq, you can listen right now to the clip that we're about to play now, which is this.  Here it is on the Worst of 2009 Countdown.  It's the Worst of 2009.  Should we get Big A in here and do something?  Yes, we have a guy who wants to meet me.  He's been here since 6 o'clock this morning. 
[00:26:00]  He's on Twitter.  I think I saw his name.  Oh, did you really?  Well, yeah.  I didn't know he was coming in, though.  He's sweating bullets because he's, you know.  He sweats a lot.  He's kind of a large man.  We should have Big A talk dirty to Belladonna.  It would be terrific.  We had Big A write something up.  Oh, you did?  You did.  That was Danny's brilliant statement.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Very good.  Ladies and gentlemen, Big A.  Big A.  How you doing?  Belladonna.  Hi.  I saw you on Twitter.  You're dead?  Yeah.  The microphone.  What, do you come from reffing a fucking football game? 
[00:26:30]  Andrew, this is very dressed up for Andrew.  You dressed up for Belladonna?  Of course.  Aww.  And she's your favorite?  Yeah.  That didn't seem to you confident about that.  No, he's already frightened.  Oh, really?  Vertical stripes.  No.  No, that's the way you're supposed to do it.  Yeah, horizontal's the bad one.  No, no, no stripes on him at all.  Oh, all right.  None.  Because, you know, it kind of, like, you ever see those maps of what the universe looks like 
[00:27:00]  when there's a mass in it that's invisible?  Oh, I see.  It's like a grid with, yeah.  He's a visual representation of mass.  Yes, mass.  There's supposed to be straight lines, but they kind of push out at times.  What he's doing?  Hey, what is he doing to you?  That's not nice.  Don't you choke her.  He has his hands around.  Well, I was doing that the first day.  God damn, that's your first day on the job.  So, Bella's standing up, and she's got her hands on the bed, and the guy is standing  up behind her, but, again, fucking her, but not brutal.  Oh, he's slapping me.  And he has his hands around her neck. 
[00:27:30]  Wow.  Those little slaps in the cheek.  I know.  And the breasts are jiggling.  I carry it.  That's so cool to watch.  The only natural tits move like that, by the way.  They're fantastic.  Like, I've got to tell any of you guys.  Yeah.  What's that guy?  By the way, by the way, only natural tits move like that.  Thank you.  Make sure you get that true coat.  What's that guy doing nowadays?  Chris Cannon.  I don't know.  Is he still doing movies?  I, you know, he could be, but I don't, I haven't shot with him since then, I think.  Are you doing, now, you're smart.  She's one of the really smart performers, because you use, you do your own company, and 
[00:28:00]  you take, you're in charge of your own stuff, which is the way to do it.  Are you doing still all stuff, or are you only doing girl-girl stuff now?  I do boy-girl and girl-girl.  I do one every other month.  Oh, okay.  And sometimes I do one with both.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Andrew, what do you got?  Andrew.  Actually, one of them.  Oh, look at me.  Oh, he's so cute.  He brushed his hair and everything. 
[00:28:30]  Look at you.  And don't ask for her panties.  They're mine.  Yes.  I can have mine if you want.  I can't leave here without her panties.  I'll pass on that.  Jimmy.  Okay, so what do you want to say to me, Belle?  What are you doing, first of all?  Tell her what you're doing.  Oh, um, should I ask the questions first?  Holy shit, you wrote something down?  Can we see your handwriting?  Quickly turn it around.  It looks like something I saw in forensic files last night.  Holy shit.  That is the writing they find.  It's the next clue for where the next body will turn up. 
[00:29:00]  Yes, look at it.  Holy shit.  Oh, that's so sweet.  Okay, guys.  What did you want to ask, Belle?  We told Andrew because he's going to meet her.  He's going to be nervous.  So, like, Danny, so why don't you run up a list of questions for Bella?  Yeah.  Maybe you can ask her.  Um, the first question is, do you rather direct or acting in movies or both?  Both.  Oh, one word answer. 
[00:29:30]  Nice.  Well, he gave her kind of multiple choice.  Yeah, it was kind of a multiple choice.  He didn't say follow up or show or work.  He didn't say follow up or show or work.  Good question.  Okay, question number, uh, two.  Right.  I think you did.  It's not like that.  She makes you nervous.  She's beautiful.  It's scary.  Um, why do you like doing black, um, black guys so much?  Why do I like doing black guys so much?  Um, because they're sexy. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, boy.  Sorry, Ant.  You just lost Ant, but Jimmy and I will continue the interview.  No, I'll be watching this for first one.  You didn't lose Ant.  Ant would turn into the cuckold, the fessy.  Ant would actually go, I can't believe I'm servicing a black ball.  Do you, do you, do you rather do girl girl scenes or boy cousins?  Both.  How about, wait, wait, wait, wait, how about a follow up question? 
[00:30:30]  That's what interviewers do.  So you got the initial question and then you're going to do a little follow up on your own.  Or read the next question.  Wow.  You have, this is Bella Donna.  She's not just some.  She's the biggest.  She's the biggest in the business.  The biggest.  She's got, you have her ear.  You have her rear.  Her ear.  Oh, her ear.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Sorry, Jim. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, that was wrong.  Um.  Wait.  Do you know how to squirt?  I do.  With the right tools.  Oh.  Oh.  We did that for Big A once.  Big A likes squirters.  Which is the right tool?  Well, it could be fingers.  It could be a dick.  Well, anything but your cock, Andrew.  Didn't we have someone spraying Andrew's face once?  Yes.  That hatchet away.  Yes.  It was Flower Tucci, I believe.  Oh, I, I, yeah, she's right. 
[00:31:30]  You know who, gosh.  She got on all fours and went off like a fire.  Yeah.  Like civil rights footage.  Yeah, kids run through her in Harlem in the fucking summer.  So, yes, Bella just had a squirt with the right gentleman, Frank.  Sure.  Um.  Do you have trouble coming up with amazing things to do on, between, that will amaze your fans? 
[00:32:00]  I haven't had any problems so far, but that doesn't mean it won't happen one day.  What do you consider amazing, Andrew?  I'll, I'll help you.  Oh, that's good.  Tell Bella what you, what you've seen her do that you thought was amazing to amaze you as her fan.  Yeah, what did you see that was amazing, amazing?  Just always trying, you know, to push the, the, the, the limit in.  Um.  Um.  Um.  Something that's been incredible with the time you got, um, fist, fuck. 
[00:32:30]  Yes.  Ah, fisting.  Yeah.  You like fisting?  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  Of course you do.  Now, did you see the clip between Jenna Hayes and myself?  No, I haven't.  Two fists.  I haven't had a chance.  Wait, two fists and who?  Two fists and me.  Wow.  Well, one in each.  What?  But she has, she has small, pretty hands.  Well, I think I have some free clips for you guys.  Oh.  I have a bunch of freebies for you. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  You can watch that now.  Now we're chugging.  Now, who's, who's in this scene?  There's, uh.  Alexis, Texas.  This is one of my favorite scenes, by the way.  You like it, yeah?  Oh, dude.  Discovering Alexis, Texas.  I know it's not one of your DVDs.  Oh, she's awesome.  Your DVDs, but you're in this DVD.  No, it is my DVD.  Oh, your company's DVD.  Yeah, but it's all about her.  I love her to death.  Dude, she's, she's incredible.  Her body's amazing.  If Bella put this guy's cock down to her fucking belly button through her mouth, you, you went  balls deep on that guy.  Well, his wasn't very long, but yes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're talking to a room full of guys that think his is long. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, thanks a lot.  Oh, no.  Jesus Christ.  Well, you know, for camera, you know, for camera.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  We were all getting along.  I would actually apologize for my dick as I was getting undressed.  I'd be like, look, you know, it's very cold in here.  Right.  I'm not a size queen off camera, but on camera, I definitely am.  Oh, shit.  Danny was just handed something.  What do we got, Danny?  These are.  I'm not quite sure.  They're my dog tags.  I give them away for free. 
[00:34:00]  Really?  For my fans.  And then you go to the website?  You can go to this website and you can get a free clip.  My brother-in-law's going to need one.  Yes, I have a handful of them here.  Holy shit.  Your brother-in-law's a big fan?  Well, fuck all the dudes tonight.  The biggest.  The biggest.  Jesus.  I really have to leave here with her panties.  That's why I keep saying it.  You can have them.  I'm not joking.  No, I know you're not.  I have to get them.  Wow.  So this is Jenna Hayes and myself.  It's been like three or four years ago.  And she's behind you and she's inserting.  Where's the first one?  Oh.  All right.  So the first fist is about to go over. 
[00:34:30]  Some girl play.  Just two girls having fun.  Hey, Big A, why don't you tell the radio audience what's going on?  Yes, explain what's going on.  He can't see.  He can't see.  Color commentary.  Color commentary by Big A.  Yeah, take the mic out of the stands.  I'm Big A.  You're panicking.  Go ahead.  You're panicking.  Get on that and tell everybody.  Give us a rundown.  Mike, closer to your mouth.  Okay.  Actually, I'm a big asshole now. 
[00:35:00]  Go ahead.  Please, we're all jerking off at you.  It's just good.  Well, right before this, I was telling her how to put her hand inside of me so that it  wouldn't hurt.  Oh.  Okay.  Because I prefer girls that don't have fake nails.  Sure.  Yeah, I would assume.  But she did have them, so.  So she had to be very careful.  You need to be very careful, yeah.  Go ahead, Big A.  And then you've got to make your hand like it's a shadow puppet. 
[00:35:30]  Basically.  Big A, go ahead.  Bella Donna is slowly fighting Jenna Hayes' hand into her asshole.  And holding on to her hand.  Yeah.  And pushing her hand in.  Right.  Wow.  What the fuck?  She does have very small hands, by the way.  All right.  So that basically is so large.  Does that do permanent damage?  No.  I mean, you have to prepare for these types of things. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  Come on.  Two hands?  Two hands.  Now the other one's going to wear it, Big A.  She does a little bit of this.  Big A, what is she doing now?  What's going on?  Oh.  Um, uh, Jenna Hayes is, is preparing to, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, well, forget it.  It's done now.  Jesus Christ.  They're on the bus going home. 
[00:36:30]  Everyone came.  It's done.  So she's preparing to what?  Jenna, Jenna Hayes just did what?  Uh, uh, uh, started with two hands into her asshole.  Wow.  No, she doesn't have two hands into her asshole.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  One in each.  Yeah.  Other than the ass.  And she's kind of going, uh, yeah.  She's not that deep.  Yeah.  She's just moving.  No, it looks like she's knitting. 
[00:37:00]  It does, actually.  Thanks.  You know, what's so great about Jenna Hayes is that she has such a filthy mouth, but she  doesn't look like she would say the things that she says.  Really?  Uh-uh.  I don't know why I even have the audio up.  Stretching in your ass like that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you fucking slut.  You like to have all your holes spelled, huh?  Oh.  Dirty little bitch that you are.  Yes.  Huh?  Oh, my God.  You don't even care what slut you are, huh?  You just fucking want it, huh?  I do.  You just want it counting in your fucking holes. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  I know you want my leg up, but it's just a cum that's very nice and bad.  I think that's crazy.  I'm shocked.  That's astounding.  We're all speechless.  It's like a magic trick.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That was the first time I had ever done that.  I want you to cum from both my fucking hands fucking me like this.  Did she pull out a rabbit at the end?  I love it.  Surprise.  I love it.  Ow.  Look at that.  Wow. 
[00:38:00]  That was so unreal to look down and see.  That's pretty amazing.  I love it.  That's a long distance from that first dick.  I know, right?  I got comfortable.  Yeah.  It's basically, if you see the way you can see the little bend in the hand, it's basically  just a little bit beyond the hand, which I'm sure there are dicks a lot larger than that.  Yes.  Very large.  Again, we sit here emasculating.  Again, not here enough.  Not in this room, but...  It's all up in your fucking cunt, in your ass.  A language.  Yeah.  I have to squeeze really tight when I cum, so that's why I'm like, my legs are that way. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Clinch your muscles.  Yes, yeah.  I love that.  Show me what a fucking...  He's got it, and down he goes at the five-yard line.  Oh, wow.  Two for three years.  Fuck.  Huh?  You fucking whore, take it.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Do you feel good?  Do you feel good?  Uh-huh.  I'm trying to DP you with my fist.  Oh.  Just like a guy would.  And that really felt good. 
[00:39:00]  Yes.  Goodness gracious!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen!  Oh, my baby.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It's all about the way you do things, you know?  I can feel your crusty clenching on my fucking hand.  Huh?  Are you fucking going to kill us?  She has a vibrator on her own clip.  Are you fucking whore?  Come on.  And I had to use my own fingers.  Are you fucking whore?  Did you like her talking to you that way?  I do.  I love her dirty mouth. 
[00:39:30]  Like, ugh.  I'll fill every one of them up.  She's so good at dirty talking.  Yeah, she's pretty good.  She keeps going.  Yeah.  A lot of times you peed her out and go, ah, I don't want to keep her peeing.  There's nothing worse than when you're like, yeah, do you like this shit?  And they're like, yeah.  And you're like, happy to hear it.  Did I ask you if you like this shit?  How much on a scale from one to 50?  Kevin got confused.  He thought you said, while you were up there, could you tie my tubes for me? 
[00:40:00]  No, Kevin.  That's not what she said.  Yeah.  What, are you getting close?  Fucking sweat?  You're going to cum all over that hand.  It'd take a while to cum.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that's good.  It's real.  That's okay.  We can wait.  Don't worry.  No rush.  What else are we going to do today?  And it's okay.  I love you for it.  Come on, take it.  Do you like that, Big A?  Take it like a fucking slut that you are.  Mike, Mike, what, Big A? 
[00:40:30]  How are you going to let this pretty girl make you fucking cum?  I like you very much.  Are you going to, well, do you have a hard on right now?  Oh, Jesus.  No hard on?  Come for me.  Oh, come for me.  Oh, this might be it right here.  Oh, come for me.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Yes.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  I love the way she is.  Wow. 
[00:41:00]  Now, Andrew, is that a scene?  What would you do if you were watching this scene along?  Does that feel good?  Oh, my God.  Which one should I take out?  Kill a hooker?  Bite a small animal?  Wow.  What would you do if you were watching this along?  I guess what anybody else would do.  Dark cloth, I guess.  Okay.  So you like the hands are clean.  Both hands clean.  Hand comes out clean.  That's really sexy.  Ta-da.  Both hands perfectly clean.  Oh, well, you got to clean them off.  I got to clean them off.  Of course you do.  That's the best part. 
[00:41:30]  Wow.  So now, Andrew, you've seen the double fisting, and did you have other questions you wanted  to ask?  Yes.  What's the name of that movie, by the way?  A lot of people want to know.  Oh, God.  That was Fetish Man.  Oh, no.  That's not in the movie because, obviously, it's fisting, so I can't put that in my movie.  That's only on my website.  Wait.  You can't do fisting now?  You can, but it's been prosecuted in the past.  That's what I mean by the PC thing, by the way.  Right.  Yeah.  There's a lot of stuff that I'm told not to do to be safe, but like you can see, I can put 
[00:42:00]  it on my website.  So what's the rule?  Is if you do it in a DVD and mail it out, like, Max got in trouble that way, and I  think Staliano...  That it's considered, yeah, I guess, trafficking.  Considering, like, who picks it up, and maybe a mom and whatever finds it in her son's room  and finds it obscene.  Hot.  But on your website, it's safe.  Right.  So far.  Okay.  Well, it should be.  Yeah, I mean, I hope it stays that way.  Exactly.  So far.  Everyone having fun in this scene.  Big A, what else you got?  Drop his papers.  He just dropped his papers on the floor. 
[00:42:30]  I'm so glad you like that.  That makes me happy.  Good.  Alexis, Texas.  Me and my chick.  Very big fan of yours.  Oh, good.  She's actually quite jealous that I'm here.  Why did you have her come?  Was she working?  Dude, you know what?  I didn't even tell her.  I forgot.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Big A.  Big A.  Another question.  Close.  Right on the mic.  Yeah, please.  We can barely hear you.  Actually, I don't have any more questions.  I have other things I was told to write.  Okay.  I was told to write.  Very sexy intro. 
[00:43:00]  By the neighbor's dog.  Way to tear down the wall there, Big A.  Wonderful David Berkowitz reference.  Jesus.  Now, what did we ask you to write?  What did you, Rocky, ask you to write?  Um, I do porno with Belladonna.  If you did a porno with Belladonna.  If I did it.  Oh.  Okay.  It's almost like Voss doing that acting.  With Chaz Palminteri?  Yes, with Chaz Palminteri.  Wait, so what is this? 
[00:43:30]  This is Big A doing porno with Belladonna?  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  So what's the name of the movie?  Actually, I didn't.  All right.  How about Bella's Nightmare?  I'm kidding.  Okay.  All right.  This is if Big A was doing porno with Belladonna.  And get right on that mic.  Yeah, go ahead, Big A.  Got to get right up on it.  Okay.  Yeah, so we can all hear. 
[00:44:00]  Um, I guess we meet in a bar.  And begin talking.  And, uh, hitting it off.  And, uh, getting, uh, friendly.  And...  What year do you meet in this bar?  1950?  And I'm an investigator, see?  She was a lovely dame. 
[00:44:30]  She had a gap in her teeth.  We hit it off.  Nice pair of stems.  We begin hitting it off.  Hitting it off.  I ask if they had pretzels.  They say no.  They only have nuts.  I know.  We meet at a bar.  They only have the dinner menu.  All right.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Hitting it off.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  We asked...  Go ahead.  Andrew's trying to not be a piece of shit.  He's trying to write actual scenarios.  Oh, my fault.  Go ahead, buddy.  I apologize.  That was disrespectful.  He's a lucky guy. 
[00:45:00]  Jesus.  Then we go to a local hotel.  And...  Was that one right after we hit it off, right?  Yes.  Okay.  And...  You forgot to mention, do you take the subway?  Do you use your Metro cars?  Jesus Christ, what happens?  I asked the cabbie for a receipt.  He says the machine is broken.  I say I need it for tax reasons.  Fucking lunatic. 
[00:45:30]  Then what happens?  That sucks.  We'll get in the sexual tension here.  I'm just going to relieve it.  Go ahead.  Okay.  That's what you're trying to do.  Yeah.  Oh!  That's my answer.  Oh!  I'll accept it.  Fair enough.  You earned it.  I'll give me gay rules.  Okay.  Okay.  We go to a local hotel and begin kissing and doing some foreplay. 
[00:46:00]  What kind of foreplay, big guy?  Yeah.  Actually, he had that licking and sucking on my nipples.  My nipples?  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  He was licking and sucking my nipples.  That's all he is doing. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Go ahead, big A.  Go ahead.  Let's see.  Big A.  Nipples.  I know.  Yes.  And then big A says, let me have a de-hungle sandwich.  I put my stack of dimes in her.  All right.  Go ahead.  This is great iced tea.  Yeah, so she's licking and sucking her nipples.  No, no.  I'm licking and sucking her nipples.  Oh, her nipples.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Very good. 
[00:47:00]  Then slowly going down to her pussy and clit.  And clit.  Yes.  As opposed to the clitless pussy.  Yes.  Well, everyone knows that because she travels, she carries them separately.  That's just the way it works.  It's the whole new carry-on rules.  It's very annoying.  It's safer that way.  It's like the president and vice president not being in the same place at the same time.  Apologize.  Good.  Yeah, sorry.  Keep going.  Then I give her pussy a lot of attention. 
[00:47:30]  What?  Play Monopoly with it?  What are you doing?  What kind of attention?  Yeah, you need some attention.  Give her a little detail.  Well, lick and suck a clit.  Pulver.  And just fuck her pussy.  Hmm. 
[00:48:00]  Our anus.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  And then she sucks my hard cock.  Oh.  Ooh.  Oh, wow.  Salty of you.  It's hard.  I'm too salty.  No, no, no.  It's better.  Okay.  No, no.  Yeah, that's good. 
[00:48:30]  Oh.  Porno script.  You're doing fine.  Yeah.  Now lick my sweaty bone.  I'm going to fuck you in the mouth.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Go ahead, Andrew.  And then I would bend her over and fuck her behind hard and fast. 
[00:49:00]  Well, so you're bending her over, you're fucking her hard and fast.  Madonna doesn't know what to say or do.  If the film doesn't fly off that reel after that and go, you're not done.  Well, it's like a really old film.  As soon as he starts fucking around the ass, just goes the end.  All right.  All right.  So what happens?  You're having sex?  He said, oh, yes.  I can smell your cunt.  Oh. 
[00:49:30]  Who would you?  What the fucking lotion in the bathroom?  Sorry, Andrew.  They're kind of giving you the business via SoundCloud.  Yeah, a little bit.  Giving you a real teasing.  So now what happens?  You're fucking her from behind.  Then I cast a blow, a load of become on a face.  Of become a?  What?  I said, blow a load of cum in her face. 
[00:50:00]  But you're fucking her from behind.  So how does this happen?  Exactly.  Now run us through.  Because that's the money shot.  This is the big ending.  Right.  So you can't just gloss through it like you did the rest of it.  Yeah, unless you plan.  Give us some detail.  Here's how it goes.  You're fucking her from behind.  Where are your hands?  What are you doing?  How do you pull out and spin her around and get it on her face?  Unless you're going to ricochet off the television.  I'm grabbing hold of her hips. 
[00:50:30]  And I pull out.  This sounds like a confession.  I'm going to ask you to read that transcript back.  Go ahead.  So your hands are on her hips.  And then I pull out.  Okay.  And I flip her over. 
[00:51:00]  And she'll suck my cock into her cum over her face.  All right.  So you should suck in your cock.  You pull out.  Right.  Do you do a little jerk?  Is it on her face?  Is it in her mouth?  Does she then spin it back out?  Is it on her hair?  Is it one of those like, ah, ah, I'm going to cum on my face?  Or is it like, oh, oh, oh, oh?  Yeah, answer that.  And also, what do you say as you're cumming on her face?  Ah, good question.  Yeah, thank you, Anthony. 
[00:51:30]  Thank you.  So where does it go?  And what are you saying as you're doing it?  It goes in her mouth.  She swallows it.  But what are you saying as she's swallowing your goo?  Take my cum, you bitch. 
[00:52:00]  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you.  Why so mean, Andrew?  Okay, all right.  Holy shit.  Someone just writes, that's all, folks.  They were just hitting it off at the bar.  You're having a nice chat.  Get all nasty.  Get all nasty at the end.  Take that cum, you communist.  Why so mean? 
[00:52:30]  Holy shit.  Why the anger, Big Ed?  Yeah.  Yeah, what happened?  You guys are having a good time.  Now she's a bitch.  Are you trying to be mean to her, or are you just trying to be dirty and a dominating?  Yeah, trying to be dirty and a dominating.  And now that the act is over, where's the ideal place that you would bury her?  If this case isn't solved in the first 48 hours. 
[00:53:00]  Were you nervous talking to Bella Donna?  Of course.  Big fan, right?  Yeah.  Bella Donna, this was a pleasure, man.  Yes.  Come back and see us, please.  Very cool.  Thank you so much, guys.  Very cool.  Next time we'll film an orgy.  Hey, can I have one of those dog tags?  You can definitely have one.  All right.  I'm fucking jerking off tonight.  Yeah, there's one for each of you.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Thank you.  And then I left you with one movie, so I don't know who's getting that.  Oh, shit.  Danny's a fan.  He requested that you get it.  What is it called?  Is that Cock Happy 3?  Yeah.  Oh, I always wondered what happened after Cock Happy 2.  And now you can find out.  Electric Boogaloo. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, this is Bella Donna, your favorite dirty slut.  You're listening to Opie and An...  These are the easiest things in the world, and I always fuck them up.  All right.  Hey, this is Bella Donna.  What is that?  Should I do that one again?  Yeah, if you want to.  Yeah, you're like, what are you doing over there?  Hey, this is Bella Donna.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On the virus, it's Sirius 197, XM 202.  Yeah, just like the movies, we played out on the last scene. 
[00:54:00]  Worst of Opie and Anthony, it's E-Rock and Sam.  That's right.  Sam, Paulo, legend from The Ron and Fez Show, is in studio.  He's got a movie.  Of course he does.  Well, I don't know if you'd call it a movie.  It's motion picture, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  So, uh...  It's a horror movie.  It's called Gap, and I watched it as part of my show homework.  Yes.  And it was unwatchable. 
[00:54:30]  One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.  Really?  Yes.  Hmm.  Well, you're going to have to suffer through it now, because Paulo's in studio, and we're  playing clips of crap.  Well, it's Gap, and thank God Louis C.K. was there with us.  Yes.  To rate this movie as he saw fit.  It's number 30.  On the worst of 2009 countdown.  It's the worst of 2009.  We got Paulo out there.  Oh, that's right.  He's going to do a movie.  He's a Ron and Fez guy, though.  He is a Ron and Fez guy.  Are we acknowledging that it's a Ron and Fez guy? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, obviously.  How did this come about?  Well, because he has a motion picture.  But wouldn't he just go on Ron and Fez and promote his motion picture?  I believe he is doing that, too.  But, see, I went on to Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  And I started talking about Paulo and his film.  Yeah.  And I had, you know, I guess a review of it.  Did you see the film?  Some of it.  Okay.  I've not seen it.  All right.  I saw some of it.  Okay. 
[00:55:30]  I heard it's good.  And you did.  Yeah, I heard it was actually really good.  And so it got to the point where, you know, we had seen it.  Sam has seen it, I believe, some of it.  Sam, you like the movie?  Sam, you saw it?  Let's see what Sam thinks of this movie.  Louie's a filmmaker.  He can appreciate a good film.  Yes.  Sam?  I was able to see the whole film last night.  It was terrifying.  It's a horror movie.  Oh, terrifying.  Terrifying.  Oh, gotcha.  Terrifying.  Fying. 
[00:56:00]  Gotcha, yes.  It was long at parts, but...  Long in parts, huh?  Yeah.  One part would be longer than another part.  It was.  The first hour was a lot longer than the second ten minutes.  I assumed that it was going to be one of those so bad that it's good movies,  especially since most of the cast I know.  Oh, really?  I've seen them walking around these very hallways.  That must be amazing. 
[00:56:30]  You just know them.  Not as actors, but as just interns and people and fucking friends of the show  and fat little English people that sell fucking t-shirts.  With tiny heads.  Little heads and no brains.  Stalkers.  Yeah.  Stalkers.  So I figured, yeah, at least I'm in on that.  It'll kind of be funny.  It didn't catch me like that.  He's right there listening.  Yeah, I didn't get it. 
[00:57:00]  I didn't get the point.  Oh, boy.  You may want to...  I didn't...  I thought it was horrible.  Well, should we...  Dude, I don't know.  Can we ask some questions?  I don't know the amount of...  Sure.  Come on in, Paul.  This is...  Come on in there, Paul-O.  The writer, director, star of...  The Orson Welles of Gap.  Yes, exactly.  Gap.  Of Gap.  The movie's called Gap.  Wait, well, I want to start by saying, Paul-O, now, it's been obviously many years. 
[00:57:30]  So they replaced the G with a C-R, and you might have a movie there.  Paul-O.  It's a spelling joke.  Yeah, we like it.  I'm not kidding.  It's been many years.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding.  You are...  Oh, crap.  Just to bring everyone up to speed, the last time you were on our show, what was it?  Was it the Sandy Cain kissing of the...  Yeah, what happened is, over the years, we've had encounters with the Sucky Bed event, and  then, of course, the Enema show, and the Tuato show, various things over the year.  But I've always respected the fourth wall, the imaginary fourth wall between Ron and Fez 
[00:58:00]  and Hopi and Anthony, I just figured there was one.  I don't know if there is one or not, but in my hand, I think that's a good use of fourth.  The tween shall never meet.  No, actually, it's not.  I think it's a terrible use of fourth one.  Well, it's maybe the mind thing that I'm thinking.  No, that doesn't matter.  Is that like, you mean...  The fourth wall is where you're watching the thing, and you imagine there's three walls to  the show, and that the fourth wall is the audience.  It's torn down.  So some sort of a barrier between Ron and Fez and this show would not be any kind of a fourth 
[00:58:30]  wall.  No.  That would be one wall.  It would be a fourth mistake.  Unless they were the audience.  Ron and Fez were the audience.  Right.  The fourth wall would be Ron and Fez.  It could be the fourth wall.  In any case, I've been with...  You saw a separate kind of thing, so...  I thought I should honor something.  I don't know what I would call it.  Well, you know what it was?  That's what...  Well, we wouldn't have you on to do your, you know, let's have Paulo do movie reviews or  things like that, because that's your Ron and Fez guy.  Right.  But since you put out a film...  Yeah, and there's a fourth wall between the two shows.  And there's a fourth wall, and there's no door. 
[00:59:00]  That's what I thought.  So you've got to go through the ductwork.  Maybe it's just a bay window or something.  That's what I'm thinking.  So, but in any case, I was doing Ron and Fez since the 90s.  Yeah, just keep trotting ahead with this.  That's fine.  I was a movie reviewer.  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  And so people expect me to know movies in and out, and then they have an expectation that  this should be like Citizen Kane, Gap.  Well, no.  Why would they expect that?  That's your movie reviewer.  Why would anyone expect a movie reviewer to make anything that is like Citizen Kane?  Well, I think they would expect that I would have a full knowledge of movies and a full 
[00:59:30]  understanding of what a movie should be.  Oh.  Not really.  No.  Oh.  Well, how long would it take you to make the movie?  Okay.  First of all, this was an experimental movie, and it took three days to make.  Experimental movie.  Three days.  Three days.  Louie's a filmmaker.  Three days?  Yeah.  What do you think of a movie that only took three days?  It would be a tenth of the amount of time it usually takes.  Yeah.  And how long is the movie?  It's an hour and 23 minutes.  So it's not like it's a short, like a five-minute short that you throw together.  No.  We cut it down for three hours. 
[01:00:00]  What?  So there's three hours.  We shot an hour a day and then edited out half of it.  They edited out Tuesdays.  Yeah.  Is there a director's cut?  You know, we'll ever be able to.  Well, here's the problem.  There's actually, before we start promoting this movie, I have to honor the Ron and Fez  Opie and Anthony community.  So because essentially this movie should only be released with no knowledge of what this  is.  So we put out the director's cut collector's edition now.  Well, don't worry.  If you see it, you won't know what it is either. 
[01:00:30]  And then we're going to put out the basic edition.  Do you want to market this to the movie theaters?  No.  I don't think we can because I have no money.  But, you know, I...  Is it good?  This is just something.  He burns you a copy on his mail.  And he writes the name of it in Sharpie on the actual disc.  So I've been listening to the Gap explanation for how many years now?  A year and a half?  Something like that.  I still have no effing idea what this movie's about.  I saw it, or most of it anyway, and I have no idea what it's about.  All I see, and scene after scene, is Polo with some type of a knife, some victim poorly tied 
[01:01:00]  up in the background.  Very loose.  Very loosely tied up in the background.  Trying not to laugh as they're squirming and not really trying, or the fear isn't really  getting there.  And then a bloodless murder scene for a horror movie. 
[01:01:30]  Well, Anthony, maybe he didn't tie them up tightly because the fear, the intimidation  of who he was, was keeping them there.  And that's part of the mistake of him as a killer.  Maybe he didn't tie Piley because it made them uncomfortable, they weren't actors, they  were just friends of his.  Well, the fear, fear and intimidation would have been a good thing to keep the viewer there  because it didn't work for me.  All right, first of all, to defend the movie, I honestly believe that, you know, there has  been an, it's a specific type of movie that you haven't seen before, and it kind of taps 
[01:02:00]  into that audience, hopefully, down the road, once I finish marketing to my core audience,  which is, of course, Rod Fez, Opie, and Anthony.  I want it to be four people.  Yeah, you don't have to put Opie and Anthony in there.  Okay.  No problem.  Rod Fez and pedophile.  That's your audience.  Pedophile fucking wife stealers.  You know, the Blair Witch Project is obviously a lot of shaky camera things.  Oh, right.  Okay, okay.  So you kind of were going for some kind of a, this is not professional, a professional 
[01:02:30]  shot.  It's supposed to be some lunatic setting up a tripod with a camera before he kills people.  Right.  The scene with No Filter Paul.  Yes.  Who's a genius.  He, genius, does a great work.  Genius.  Oh, I'm using that word again.  I want to see that.  He, that scene goes on and on and on to the, it's maddening.  And I don't mean in a good way.  It's not like I was, I was saying, I don't mean like watching this and going, holy shit,  this is great. 
[01:03:00]  I was like, holy shit, they're still fucking doing this.  I left.  Usually when I'm watching a movie I haven't seen before and I have to go take a piss, grab  a beer, whatever.  I pause it.  Sure.  I didn't pause this.  I just went.  I took a piss.  I grabbed a beer.  I washed my car, whatever.  I come back.  Fucking No Filter Paul is still in the chair, loosely tied, with no shirt on.  Everybody is in their underwear.  That's true.  Yeah.  Everyone's in their underwear.  And there's some nudity as well, because, you know, they say the foreign markets, you 
[01:03:30]  need the nudity.  Foreign markets?  What are you looking for?  Foreign?  Jersey?  We're talking Japanese.  I need Japanese.  The Japanese.  The Japs, please.  Let's change the G to a J, then.  We'll think it's about them.  Oh, he go over fourth wall.  He went over fourth wall.  Fourth wall.  No, you can never go over fourth wall.  Between the Roy Fizze or the Anthony.  It's a fourth wall.  I love the Gap.  Hey, are you familiar with a movie called Peeping Tom? 
[01:04:00]  Yes, of course.  Oh.  Well, Louie might be onto something.  Louie thinks that your movie sounds very much like Peeping Tom.  Oh, like Peeping Tom.  It is.  It's the same movie.  It's a famous British director who did a lot of great classes.  Who fucked a wife of some guy and shipped her over.  That's right.  Oh.  He was in prison.  He did a famous ballet movie called The Red Shoes, but he did the Peeping Tom.  Real famous.  Oh.  No clue.  Uh, I also just, I want to touch on something, um, the way it was shot and edited. 
[01:04:30]  Yes.  Do you, do you or the editor or anybody, who was in charge of the aspect ratio of the movie?  All right, there were, uh, the, the, the, the, the whole point is to be as experimental as possible.  Right, I understand.  So you change aspect ratios for time.  I understand.  So it would go from widescreen.  Yeah, but here's the thing, with experimental film, the idea is that you have an idea that you're burning to do as a filmmaker.  Mm-hmm.  Nobody's really done it before, but they're, you're willing to try it as an experiment to see if it'll work. 
[01:05:00]  The thing isn't to go, I want to make an experimental movie.  So what kinds of things are experimental?  Yeah.  You're supposed to start with an idea of a movie, that this is a movie I really want to make.  I think this would be cool.  And even though it hasn't been done, I'm willing to do the experiment.  You're starting with, I want to do something weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  How about changing the aspect ratio that will hurt people's eyes?  That will just, like, the thing is, I'm thinking, if you were going to go widescreen, then you shoot the whole thing widescreen.  And then, in editing, you make it look like the regular old style TV. 
[01:05:30]  What ratio is that?  3-4 or something like that?  Going that.  That gets it to fractions.  Right.  What?  It gets it to fractions.  Well, whatever it is, you could have laid the whole thing out so that my television wouldn't snap back and forth.  It was stretching and snapping.  Like, your TV knows.  Your TV, your DVD players these days, it knows when to do certain things to certain aspect ratios. 
[01:06:00]  So, if you would have just kept it all widescreen and then made it look, it wouldn't have been.  It was so distracting.  Every time it switched, my TV went click, click, and then numbers came up on the side, a code, the fucking stretch.  It said wide.  It went, like, my TV was freaking out.  My TV hated your movie.  The movie is actually supposed to generate hate in every possible way.  It's supposed to force people, confront people, push people to the edge in a lot of ways. 
[01:06:30]  In a different way, I think, was the intent.  It forces people to turn off their TVs.  Well, I figured every way I could do it.  It forces people to rent Peeping Tom, which was the one you stole it from, which is better.  I didn't see him.  Oh, boy.  Which was better.  We all steal.  See, what you're saying is...  Wait, I didn't steal.  Yeah, you and the thieves all steal.  Hey, Paula, what I'm saying is there's a difference between...  Let's see, you're watching a movie about a bank robbery.  And you're, like, immersed in it and going, holy shit, I'm afraid, I'm concerned for these 
[01:07:00]  characters, there's a bank robbery going on.  And then actually being involved in a bank robbery.  Right.  You're going to feel an emotion.  Right.  Like you said, to bring out hatred, it's supposed to.  But it's the wrong thing.  In the movie version, it's great if you could bring that out.  The physical act of watching it made me hate you.  Okay, well, first of all, not the movie.  It's essentially an anti-film.  It goes against all the film jargon and the film logistics that you're used to. 
[01:07:30]  So, you see, in a way, that's...  The groaning you're hearing is Louis C.K.  A filmmaker.  A filmmaker.  No, we should take what you're saying.  Shut it, James.  I do.  No, we should do, because Louis is here.  Fucking Jimmy is an insufferable prick.  Can we get the first scene of the movie, and we can watch it, because I've never seen  any...  Get the first scene up there.  Would you mind if we broadcast the first scene of this movie?  You really want to go to the North? 
[01:08:00]  Can I say something about Louis?  No, we don't.  Louis is a brilliant filmmaker.  Yes.  He's a brilliant guy.  But...  But...  Fantastic.  You're a genius.  There's an idea here that maybe you pushed that he didn't think of.  And it's almost like he's trying to cut off your legs, because what if your idea is all  of a sudden better?  Yeah, I'm used to that.  I am burning with jello cake.  Right.  But let me just say to Louis C.K.  It's killing me.  Let me just say to Louis C.K.  I went the wrong way with my career. 
[01:08:30]  As I say...  Yes.  This is intended for...  First of all, this has been developed on air for a year and a half, so everybody's aware  of it.  Not by anyone's choice, by the way.  I understand that.  That's understandable.  But here, it's really supposed to leap out of, like, the shadows, and you don't know  what the fuck this is.  It makes you want to leap from a ladder.  And so, you know, when you find it and have no knowledge of it...  Like your ex there.  Then you'll be real and say, what the fuck is this?  Polo, I can understand.  I can...  I understand what you're saying about it, but it's not... 
[01:09:00]  I understand the aspect ratio is a problem.  No.  And I did have a camera problem, because I had two different cameramen, so there was a  problem.  All right, listen.  Well, two different cameramen.  Holy shit.  Desi Arnaz?  Now you're getting a little crazy.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  We've got Polo.  He's promoting, I guess, Gap.  Are you doing something crazy on Ron and Fez today?  I'm always available.  You said something about your last stunt.  Yeah, and we sent out a crazy...  It's your suicide.  ...life coach guy sent out a crazy memo to you guys that I was going to be... 
[01:09:30]  What does the title mean?  The Gap.  Right.  Oh, it's actually, here's the message.  The divisions in society.  The generation gap was the core issue.  Right, yeah.  But I mean, we're always divided from each other on every level.  What does that have to do with some guy in his underwear killing another guy in his  underwear?  He's torturing people, sacrificing people so we will love each other more.  So we'll learn.  It's like a lesson.  So you'll love each other more?  I think you guys are prejudging it. 
[01:10:00]  I mean, it's honestly, I have a social message.  After the break...  Maybe I was too stoned when I watched it.  Maybe.  I don't know.  After the break...  CaptainMovie.com.  After the break, we'll do the opening scene, because you've got a filmmaker in studio,  and you'll get an honest review, okay?  Thank you.  I want to see some of this film.  And also, you've got to show off your horrendous tattoos sometime today.  Sometime today.  I'll be nice.  It's the worst of 2009.  Continuing on with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Now, we have an interview that we did with Paulo. 
[01:10:30]  Yes.  That we will play after this segment here.  So you better stay tuned, because that's a reason for you to keep listening.  Yes.  Well, this is part two of...  Crap.  Gap is the name of the movie, but yes, it was...  No, Ron told me it's called crap.  Ron sometimes plays tricks on you, because you have a weak mind.  I'm so gullible.  I know you are.  It's the worst of 2009.  Boy, we're lucky.  Paulo in studio.  Oh, yeah.  Promoting Gap on our show.  Yep.  I don't know what we did to Ron and Fez to deserve this.  Well, it's the fourth wall. 
[01:11:00]  Payback's going to be a bitch.  Huh?  The fourth wall is finally broke.  Yeah, that fourth wall, he's still going with Louie.  That's the incorrect use of the fourth wall.  I'm fucking wrong.  I'm sorry, I was corrected.  Thank you, Louis C.K.  Louie already explained that that just doesn't work.  TheMovie.com.  And I even got a promotional code, Ron Fez.  If you go there, it'll send you the film, baby.  I need to sell them.  Some people are saying that they send money, you don't send the movie.  Oh, that was...  That's great.  That's a great service.  People are busting balls.  You send money, we don't send the movie.  In this case, that is actually the proper thing. 
[01:11:30]  It's the easiest transaction you'll ever take part in.  There's some accusations out there, Paul.  You're not sending out the movie.  Because that's what people do on those message boards.  They bust balls.  Why would anybody take the time to make a complaint that's totally unbased?  Because it's a lot.  I hate to win.  Obviously, you have been slow on the shipping.  This is for you, Lou.  We're going to look at the first scene of Gap.  That word is there?  The first word was there.  The second word is...  This is the playful font choice.  It is the playful font. 
[01:12:00]  There's a lot of music going on.  Play school font.  Yeah, play school.  Yeah, it is.  Wait, where's our audio?  And then he changes to...  There is rock music.  That's actually the...  Wait, we need the rock music.  He writes Gap twice.  And that's the shaky Friends opening...  Yeah, the Friends opening font.  Friends opening font.  The music's gone.  These are all default choices on Final Cut Pro.  I'm a monster.  Oh, this is the movie?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  I'm a monster.  And that's me as a young, toe-headed child.  Now, I'm a monster. 
[01:12:30]  No!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  War.  Life is a war.  We hate each other.  It's hopeless.  It'll never get any better.  I wish I could do something about it.  So I am.  This is an art film.  I want to do something.  It matters.  I'm watching your movie.  Have an impact.  Fuck's sake.  We're in a theater, I agree.  I get it.  I see it in faith.  Does somebody change the channel, or is this still the movie? 
[01:13:00]  It's still the movie.  I'm really in favor of torturing anyone.  That's my late life.  That's the dead life.  That doesn't make me necessarily a nice person, but it just means you don't have to give back  what they did to you.  Unfortunately, the life they chose.  And it does lead to that.  Besides, I didn't make a choice.  Make a choice about what?  Well, she made hers.  Hit stop.  You couldn't wait for the truck to fucking pass by?  I wish there was a win. 
[01:13:30]  There's a truck in the fucking, let's take that again.  This is a video.  No, no, that's not a, that's not a halftime.  Have you examined it?  Yes, I have.  And I don't find any true evil in myself.  I find a lot of horrible mistakes.  I think you need to take it closer.  Is this a toll booth on the Jersey Turnpike?  No, I've made a lot of horrible mistakes, but they were never evil.  She's good.  Well, if that's what you say, but I don't know. 
[01:14:00]  I'm not doing this to say it.  Audrey Hepburn.  She was good before she fell off a ladder with a shoulder infection.  And she wears lots of wacky clothes over the years.  You've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Not anymore.  You could save my soul and my body.  Your soul.  Would you die?  Yes.  Okay.  I would.  All right.  That's all.  Okay.  She should have filmed her suicide.  This is the first one I lived with forever and lived through tragedy after tragedy with 
[01:14:30]  in what seemed like forever, but it had to end.  Cops in traffic court read into the record better than that.  With her crazy hat.  A cop reading into the record what he saw you do on the highway when you were speeding reads  better than that.  She's as good as it ever got.  Get James Earl Jones.  Wait, wait, wait.  She found the right balance of medication.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got to pause this.  I don't.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, you got to pause.  I want to know why, if this is some kind of a video diary of some fictitious thing, why 
[01:15:00]  did you put realism in there?  Like, you talk about her.  It's really her.  She really did do that.  She's dead now, and you recite.  It's not part of a movie.  It's like the fucking director having his little home movie and a little comment at the beginning  of a movie.  They always say that you write what you know.  You didn't write what you know. 
[01:15:30]  You put down.  It's a documentary.  It's a whole movie.  That was a whole movie.  Also, she talks like he does.  Everything in the movie is just this rambling never.  Sentences that literally don't begin.  Some people have sentences that don't end.  He has sentences that don't begin.  It just comes in the middle.  One moment, you're not listening to him.  The other moment, you are.  You go, how did I get?  Where am I?  Where am I?  It's a quasi-pseudo-documentary.  It's a quasi-pseudo-documentary.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, quasi-pseudo.  Yeah, it is.  Going a few words together makes it all a little better. 
[01:16:00]  A quasi-pseudo-documentary.  Okay, now I'm looking at you, and you're screaming, apparently.  Yeah, it's obviously something's going on.  Oh, yeah.  Now something...  Okay, this is...  What is it?  You're yelling.  I'm always trying to clarify my thoughts, make sure I'm right, make sure I'm not making  mistakes.  I mean, there are so many gaps.  Gaps.  I see.  Now look at this in the...  I don't want to start using music in this presentation, but music is so dead, so arrogant, distasteful, 
[01:16:30]  contemptuous, with no heart.  No wonder the record industry is being destroyed.  If they even call it the record industry anymore.  It's not something like that.  Ooh, commentary.  Can you stop for a second?  So what's happening there is he's going to start putting some score, some music in it,  so he tells the audience, I'm going to play some music now during this movie.  It'll be like you're watching Jaws, and you hear, hey, here comes a shark, listen to this 
[01:17:00]  piece of music.  That makes it sound scary.  Do these go together well to you, folks?  Write me a letter and let me know.  Why did you do that?  Because, exactly, he is commenting on the fact that he's putting in music that he hates,  you know, this modern, you know...  Record industry.  Give me a break.  So he's commenting on the destruction of society.  God, record industry.  Why do they call it that anymore?  They don't.  You're the only one calling it that.  It's called the music industry.  He's a guy who's obsessed with the generation.  Is he?  Oh, it's a character.  I'm sorry. 
[01:17:30]  It's a character.  It's a character.  So, exactly.  And he's obsessed with the records.  Records don't exist anymore.  I know.  It's crazy.  It's just insane, right?  It's just, yeah.  Wow.  I keep playing it with that.  All right.  Let's do it.  I'm too late.  It's being a high point.  That's because civilization died.  It's killing music.  Civilization.  It's going like this.  So, I'm just going to play some music here.  Everybody's going to be here. 
[01:18:00]  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you.  Can you understand what I'm saying?  That requires repeated viewings.  You see, this is the film that does really work.  It requires repeated throwing into the garbage and never watching even once.  And the deeper you get in, you're repeating.  It requires repeated attention to the sound mix.  Let's hear that again.  Make sure we can hear what he's saying.  Because otherwise, why say anything if you're not going to turn it up?  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:30]  Go, Paul.  For the first time you listen to this, I've got to see.  I didn't hear.  I've got to hear.  No, you're just saying, why the fuck can't I hear what he's saying?  Paul, I think so far you're doing well with the review and Louis C.K.  So far it's really good.  I think after I'm dead, this will become a huge thing.  Yeah, because I'm going to murder you and they're going to find out it's because of this piece of shit.  Let's go back.  We're almost done with our review. 
[01:19:00]  It's going to be Exhibit A.  And neither can I.  If you're not blind.  I wish I was blind right now.  Some of the nudity coming right up.  Oh, wow.  The first abduction of people.  I hope it's not you.  We have a couple who appear to meet up typical couplings in the night.  I mean, pointlessness of common sexual behavior of modern society, human species.  Why is she laughing in the background? 
[01:19:30]  She's not laughing.  Why is she screaming?  She's scared.  It's like she's crying.  There's a naked girl on the couch in the background.  God needs to have the world back in a purer form.  And the only way I can do this is...  How did she not really think you were going to kill her?  Like, you're that nuts.  I would think you were making a snuff film.  Is that supposed to be a blood stain on the back, Walder?  See, that's the kind of little details in the reviewing.  Yeah, little details.  Oh, my God.  People will pick it up.  You're right. 
[01:20:00]  Going back and forth on the message board.  Is that supposed to be a blood stain?  Yeah, no, exactly.  You're supposed to be thinking, is that a blood stain?  You're not supposed to be going, did that idiot really think that I was going to think that's a blood stain?  Did they think for a second that I was going to buy that?  Fucking red paint?  What did you do?  You know, Jesus.  It looks like it was done with like a thin brush.  That's kind of thematic reinforcement in a way.  No, it's not.  It's subliminal. 
[01:20:30]  It's just a mistake on your part to have done such a shot at all.  Subliminal.  There's nothing subliminal about it.  It couldn't be more obvious.  It's in the back.  Oh, my God.  You don't want to be very obvious with it.  You just wanted to kind of put it there and let people think about it.  It's like subliminal.  Right, Jim.  Yeah, please.  Something not subliminal but like.  Do we at least get to see this girl's tits?  Yeah.  Who is the girl?  She's actually very good.  I don't care.  You can tell she's naked.  She's actually very good.  It's my brother-in-law's ex-wife. 
[01:21:00]  Okay, good, good, good.  All right, let's go.  My ex, my son, we got it.  Your brother-in-law's ex-wife.  And making it as horrifying an experience.  You and your sister?  That's what I was talking about.  To make it understood that.  All right, you're holding some weapon race.  Weapon race.  Yes, thank you.  There's shears.  Shears.  And there's also some long metal.  All right, let me just point something out.  There's a girl, a naked girl, over on the bed.  We look on her face like, come over any time, guys. 
[01:21:30]  Instead, we're listening to a fat guy in an orange shirt with a horrendous mustache.  Say things that mean nothing.  Exactly.  This is good camera work, though, because...  And there's a light behind the camera, which is the most annoying thing in the world.  No, the light is from the camera.  It doesn't matter what the source of the light is.  It's behind your stupid fucking head.  You can see the camera, man, and you're fucking painting on the wall.  It is really fucked up.  Is that the light from the camera in a reflection?  Yeah, just take that picture down.  If you remember Clockwork Arts, there was a lot of that kind of stuff. 
[01:22:00]  Well, this is just like...  Exactly.  How dare you.  How dare you.  It's one of the most carefully made, beautiful films ever.  Fucking Kubrick.  But it was made deliberately to look like a porno film.  How dare you.  It is.  This doesn't...  A porno director, you wouldn't get hired as a porno director.  I swear to God.  If you gave this to a fucking porn company, they'd go, fuck you.  I swear to God.  They wouldn't hire you to swab the cum off the floor.  You were saying you wanted Clockwork Arts to look like a porno film. 
[01:22:30]  They wouldn't let you fluff the biggest, the ugliest fag on the set.  Your instincts are so poor that we don't even want you around here.  You're going to fuck something up.  We're talking about the camera work.  Oh, there's no fluff.  Oh, good God.  Louie.  Go ahead.  All right.  That was intentional.  It was absolutely intentional.  We want to see the naked chick at least.  She has zoomed so far.  She's really trying to get out of those ties.  She's frightened.  She's really moving.  I'm a big guy. 
[01:23:00]  She kind of looks hot though.  Yeah, she looks very hot.  She's very hot.  She reminded me of Angel Tompkins from the 70s.  She doesn't remind me of anybody because I can't see her because I'm looking at you.  If you remember, Angel Tompkins was a gorgeous actress in the 70s.  Right.  Good reference.  But soon my rambling will be over and we'll do the zoom.  The rambling is good enough because it shows the state of mind.  Thank you.  He's getting up.  He's getting up with the shears.  You did sacrifice for the benefit of the viewers. 
[01:23:30]  For the benefit of the viewers.  Oh, you're telling them that I'm doing this.  Oh, man.  She's scared.  She's acting.  Dude, what the fuck is she doing there?  How'd you get a hot girl in your movie?  Oh, no.  She's acting.  It's a disaster.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  She looks frightened though.  Oh, turn up that music again.  There's a nipple.  What are you...  Are you cutting it?  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, God.  Really?  The back of your leg?  Oh, now it's...  How's the naked guy?  What the fuck?  All right.  We could talk about this.  Let's pause.  Yeah, because he killed her.  Let's go to Louie, because Louie's moaning over there.  He's moaning.  Wait, Louie had a problem with the murder scene, Paul.  Yeah.  Let's go to Louie.  The back of his leg, we're hearing you going, eh.  And we had a very good opportunity to see a nice set of tits, and you wouldn't even give  us that in this crappy movie. 
[01:24:30]  And you don't even throw just a little jar of blood in the shot or something.  Yeah, why was there that a bloodless...  Would you use all the paint on the wall?  There's no more red paint.  Sorry.  There was a lot of blood later.  We brought in a guy who was actually good in a lot of...  Brought in a guy.  Brought in a guy.  Brought in a guy.  Benjamin Moore.  And we used a lot of the old school...  You know, where we...  You must have cut all that out.  It was late.  Because I just saw the back of your leg and heard you...  Yeah, where's the murder?  And that wasn't horrifying. 
[01:25:00]  It's implied.  Was she dead?  Implied.  At the end of that?  Because her tits were still moving up and down like she was still breathing.  I thought you said it's a slasher movie.  People don't die right away.  They even did...  Oh, well...  When people were guillotines, they even did a study back in the old days about how long  the heads would respond.  Can we try that now?  Sometimes 10 seconds.  Who did the study?  Who funded it?  Guys who were interested in guillotines.  Yeah, you know what?  You're right.  That's the best murder scene I ever saw.  You just talked me into enjoying it.  I'm winning him over. 
[01:25:30]  You just debated it into a good scene.  Holy shit.  Instead of actually shooting anything that matters.  And I think with repeat viewing...  I mean, Jesus Christ.  Enough with the repeat viewing.  Especially in this day-age.  Yeah, repeat viewing.  No one has time for repeat viewing.  Repeat viewing.  Come on.  Let's get this murder out of the way.  Yes, let's keep going.  Sure.  ...experience at this point in that the idea of...  Now, here, I had him, who I always feel the male is the guiltier of the species.  The more vile, the more evil, the real predator, the real source of all that is wrong with society. 
[01:26:00]  Did somebody off camera just cough?  Yeah.  I did hear that.  Can you please roll it back?  You really did hear that.  It never happened.  And again, we need to sacrifice...  Nobody's respecting the set like they're sitting there.  You can hear them walking around.  No, there was a cough in the studio here.  First of all, that is wrong with society.  If somehow women could take control and take over, it might be...  There is somebody cough. 
[01:26:30]  What about him?  He's choking in the background.  That wasn't him.  That wasn't him.  All right.  Oh, there's a boring knife again.  Would you just use the cam mic?  It's just turning the ass or whatever.  We'll see.  No, it was a good camera.  Who was?  Oh, he's acting.  He's acting.  It's really not personal.  It's just to...  This film will hopefully be seen by everyone.  No, it won't.  And yet, you're going to die.  Everybody have a shitty day. 
[01:27:00]  Everybody have a shitty day.  You're going to die soon.  I'm having a shitty day right now.  You don't even know her name.  No.  I wish I was him really living that moment.  I'd rather be that guy really tied up on a couch.  Getting shears in you.  Yeah.  Than watch it happen.  That was convincing.  Let me go.  Let me go.  I don't know her name.  I don't know your name.  Yeah, you don't know her name.  You don't know my name.  I'll get somebody out.  Okay.  I need another guy.  Was there a script?  It's really not about...  The way this was done.  People are...  Yes or no question. 
[01:27:30]  It's a yes or no question.  It was very Larry David.  Right.  It's a yes or no question.  That's right.  Was there a script?  Well, I bought a computer.  No.  I got final draft, which is a script writing program.  I bought some paper with three holes in the sides and some brats.  I then proceeded to write some...  So there wasn't a script.  We had extensive interviews with everyone involved in the film.  So there would be a common ground. 
[01:28:00]  When I interacted with them, I would know everything that they were doing.  Kind of like everybody working towards the same goal in their own way.  Right.  Right.  I interviewed everyone and I knew...  I want to fucking choke, Jimmy.  Why?  I want to choke you out.  I actually understand where you're going with this.  I want to Vince McMahon your head.  I'm not saying that there aren't certain things that could probably be fixed in post,  but I do think that it's a lot better.  Everybody's just kind of razzing you.  Yeah.  They're right.  I think busting balls is what I'm used to.  That's part of it.  That's what makes it funny.  Sure.  Soon enough, you're going to be dead. 
[01:28:30]  And it's moments away, moments away, and the pain will be bad for the first few seconds.  But trust me, it won't be that long before you are lost in oblivion.  If this was...  Let me say something about what you just said.  If this was a filming...  If he murdered this person...  Yeah.  ...and then tried to sell it, like, as a ghoulish, you've got to see this...  Even...  He wouldn't be convicted of the murder if this was the evidence.  Because the fucking cops and the jury would start watching and go,  I just turned it up, let him go, turn it off. 
[01:29:00]  I don't want to watch this.  I don't want to watch this.  Well, I was kind of...  I don't want to watch it until the point where I witnessed the murder and put him in jail.  All right.  But the dialogue was kind of chilling, though.  Pause for a second.  Because I want to comment on his dialogue.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Where you're walking this guy through the fact that you're going to kill him,  and he's pretty much helpless, and he has to hear what's going to happen to him.  What do you have in your pocket?  What is in your pocket there?  I believe...  That's my wallet.  It's kind of a big wallet.  Yeah.  So why did you have your wallet while you were fighting?  If you were filming, couldn't you leave that on your dresser or something? 
[01:29:30]  No.  That's cool.  Chubby.  Oh, my God.  Let's get to the murder.  And maybe we can stop this.  Would you stop short there, Jim?  I'm just going to carry a DVD in there.  Let's look at the back of his leg again.  There's a lot more blood later in the movie.  Sure.  And, you know, most of these murder movies don't have a lot of blood.  You actually do get a lot of implied violence.  A lot of films that are pretty terrifying.  Where are you stabbing him?  You're showing his chest and head. 
[01:30:00]  Where are you stabbing him?  Where are you working the lower torso?  I don't see...  No, look.  There's nothing there.  I don't see...  It's below the camera.  Out of view of camera.  Where are you stabbing him in the ass?  Where are you just stabbing him?  Ass and balls?  Ass and balls.  There's no blood.  Yeah, he looks like he's being stabbed in the balls right now.  Look at the look on his face.  Look how bored that guy is.  You just lay there.  You can roll onto the floor.  You didn't have much of a budget, so why wouldn't you use all your blood early in the movie  to really get people hooked?  Yeah.  Why waste all the blood later on when no one is still there watching? 
[01:30:30]  Louis' groans are the best, like, review you can ever have.  It's just...  All right, let's see how this guy dies.  Will you try to purposefully avoid the violence on camera because it's got like a Hitchcock vibe?  Exactly, and that's...  Believe me, you'd be surprised if we listed the amount of films where the violence happens  off the camera and it's implied.  Like what?  Name one movie.  Yeah, but you're not implying violence in this scene.  You're showing that it's definitely not happening.  Because you're showing the vital organs of the person. 
[01:31:00]  And there's nothing wrong with it.  So you are proving that that's definitely...  You're making it very clear that the person is yelling for no reason.  We're not seeing his penis.  We don't see his penis.  If you cut off somebody's dick and ate it, they wouldn't die for three days.  Right, thank you, Louie.  I had a long metal thing that could have gone up his ass.  Oh, sure.  All right, it's implied up the ass.  Sure.  You could have made a better movie if you cared at all.  It was $5,000.  It's not even lack of skill.  It's just not giving a shit. 
[01:31:30]  Three days.  Remember that, too.  All was experimental.  Of course...  Experimental, three days, right.  That's not how you get reviews.  Well, we've got to give him a break because it only took, you know, a month instead of two  months to film the movie.  You look at the...  What was the desperado that Robert Rodriguez did?  That was the big way that they pushed that thing.  There you go.  Now he's Rodriguez.  No moment.  No moment.  Are you comparing yourself to Robert?  It's very shoddy.  You look at Evil Dead 1, very shoddy looking.  But this is supposed to look shoddy looking.  And this is what's not being acknowledged. 
[01:32:00]  The original Evil Dead did kind of have a very low-grade quality to it, but the horror was  there.  Right, exactly.  Hopefully, at some point, when this movie is out and people don't know about it...  It is out.  No, but I know.  I know.  At this point, I haven't really promoted...  Yeah.  I haven't really fully promoted it.  All right.  And I'm going to continue to promote it.  We're called Ron and Fez.  And then years from now...  Years from now, right.  They're going to say...  People are going to find this movie and they're going to say, what the fuck is this?  And believe me, that's the reaction that's going to happen with people. 
[01:32:30]  They're going to be confused because they won't know the backstory.  I say it now.  We all know some of the backstory.  I'm saying, what the fuck is this now?  But it's because...  Also because you know the backstory.  Yes.  But those that don't know the backstory will be more...  No, they'll just say, some guy grabbed a camera and some friends and made a shitty  movie.  I think.  I think.  You see, you think.  But you're looking at it from your perspective.  You know something?  You're absolutely right.  Fucking Mall Cop was the number one movie for two weeks in a row. 
[01:33:00]  Who am I to say?  He looks like it was in this movie.  And you notice I lost a lot of weight, too.  You look good.  What?  I lost 60 pounds in six months, mostly from stress from the divorce.  That's good for you.  That's a healthy way to lose weight.  On the Magic Johnson diet.  Only hope.  Yeah.  Now we get to the local report.  Oh, just a wow sticker.  All I need to say is...  Great.  Great.  We got our fucking wow sticker in there.  Thanks for putting a wow sticker in the shitty film. 
[01:33:30]  Can we assume that he now has to digitize that out on every copy?  That would rule.  Please.  All right.  So the context is that I don't like mainstream movies.  I am the fucking target audience.  Right.  For this kind of film.  This is shit.  I am the closest you're ever going to get to someone who would give a shit.  It's literally...  And the reason is because crazy David Van Vector with his piss palms and the fucking retarded  Russian, who I am one of eight people who saw that movie, they really cared about how 
[01:34:00]  they made...  It didn't mean that they shot it like professionally or slickly.  It means that they are with some...  They gave a shit.  They didn't just fuck up and not try again.  They put some...  They fucking mixed it so you could hear what the guy was saying.  This is just shit.  First of all, number one, we know that this is experimental film.  Oh, God.  No.  Okay.  That's it.  We know that...  Just keep going that circle.  And we know it's supposed to look like this.  This guy defend his...  You ever seen the early films, the short films of David Lynch, for instance? 
[01:34:30]  Again, David Lynch, how dare you drag him into this?  How dare you drag him into this?  He has brought up names of legendary directors.  Artsy directors.  And then I look up and just see that.  A wow sticker on a car.  Did you do any second takes?  Not with the no filter Paul stuff, because it's all gold.  It really is.  It's all gold.  How bad is the no filter Paul stuff? 
[01:35:00]  It's so...  It goes on forever.  Can we see...  Maybe...  Yeah, just get to that part.  It's right now.  It's right now.  There's a chapter...  Oh, it's coming up?  This is it?  20 minutes.  Oh, the music.  That's it, man.  I still feel the Paul in his car.  I think that's a laugh.  Laying across the street.  I believe you're asleep.  He fell asleep in his car.  What happened?  Yeah, I'm picking off the easy three.  Now it's just him, shirtless, badly tied up to a chair, bouncing around like a cartoon character. 
[01:35:30]  So what?  Did you kill him and then put his shirt back on?  No.  I got him.  He was drugged out from a night of...  Oh, God.  I had no intensity that day.  I wasn't getting my message across, but that pig was so monstrous.  Well, wait a minute.  Now you're both talking.  Now you're talking on screen and off screen.  Right. 
[01:36:00]  Now you're fucking narrating and talking at the same time.  I...  As a...  Not on purpose.  No, it's because you just fucked that you were allowed.  As a psycho, I did edit and I did look at my...  And prepare it.  And he rips off like clerks or something.  I was about to say, why are you ripping off Kevin Smith with the dramatic title card?  With the words on there and then going to different scenes like Kevin Smith.  Well, he ripped off people way before that.  I mean, like...  Well, Kevin Smith...  We're not arguing Kevin Smith's, you know, filmatic integrity. 
[01:36:30]  We're talking about your piece of garbage.  I'm saying that these are things that are not used that often and they need to be brought  back from time to time.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll throw it in there.  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  And what am I saying?  Interesting things, you know, musical terms, which...  What comment on the action?  Not...  What...  How...  What comment?  There's no comment being made.  Agitated.  With excitement.  Agitated.  Oh, you mean the word comment?  The words you actually wrote upon the screen? 
[01:37:00]  Yes.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  Well, let her rip.  Cross, anyhow.  Any credence to any of you worthless scum, but I will appreciate you enough to avoid the  moral bankruptcy of obscenity.  How time are you, cocksucker?  I'll be bleeping out anything he has to say.  Oh, my God.  Because that's not exactly part of my message.  This, by the way, goes on for how long?  Oh, it's probably a 15-minute seat.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  15 minutes of just what you're seeing right here. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, my God.  It's Paul trying to get out of the shitty tie job.  He jiggles and curses for 14 and a half minutes.  Yeah, just jiggling and saying, fuck you.  Let me out of here, you fucking cocksucker.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  And then Paolo is just rambling through the whole thing.  I think we're pretty well engaged in this scene.  Back and forth.  Because he can't.  Oh, it's terrible.  Some sort of a statement.  Look how bored he gets between strugglings. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  He kind of looks around like, are we done now?  Hello?  I'm timing, you cunt.  Okay, so then he does that.  He looks at people off camera.  Yeah, he looks at the cameraman.  Oh, there's another special shot.  A little insert there.  What's your problem, Dick?  I went to the camera, adjusted the camera.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Because I'm not.  And we're still on that shot.  We're still sitting on this insert shot of his legs.  Why are we looking at this?  Because this is clearly something that would not be in a normal film.  You won't see a shot completely ill-framed like that. 
[01:38:30]  Am I correct or not?  What the fuck is happening here, Louis C.K.?  That's what's happening in this movie.  What the fuck is happening?  Do you understand?  No.  You didn't try.  You didn't try.  You didn't try.  That's exactly it.  There wasn't any effort to...  No, you didn't try.  I swear.  You got sleepy.  I swear.  You felt sleepy.  Look, it happens all the time.  You're making a movie and you go, oh, fuck.  Could I just get out of here?  And then you go, wait a minute.  I got to at least try to...  Even if I'm trying to do something shoddy, I got to try to do the best version. 
[01:39:00]  I need everybody out there.  You got to sleep.  Somebody's $5,000 just spent it on that fucking weird clothes that I bought.  He's the Ron Fez promo code.  Holy shit.  I think we're finally even with Ron and Fez.  Wow.  For the Earl thing.  Holy shit.  It is exactly what Louis said.  It's not like, yeah, you're looking going, holy shit, what is this?  No, you would do that if the movie was done well and someone gave a shit about it. 
[01:39:30]  And then you would look and say, wow, what is this?  This is kind of weird.  This is like you just didn't put effort into it.  You said you wanted to make a movie.  That's the problem.  There was more effort in you saying, I want to make a movie than making the movie.  This is an anti-film.  It is meant to...  Just keep saying this.  What is an anti-film, by the way?  What I need to understand is that it means it doesn't use the editing process.  No, that's not the case.  Yes, but here, you see, when you see a film, most people are willing to put the suspension 
[01:40:00]  of belief into a film.  They know the process of making a film that has all these edits.  Here, we take the editing out.  No, you don't, because you edit a lot in this scene.  Yeah, you edit it.  That's the thing you do just enough to show that you didn't give a shit.  We walk to the camera.  Just enough.  Turn it off.  Turn it back on with a different shot.  Spike Lee made a movie called Get on the Bus about all the guys, black guys going to  the Million Man March. 
[01:40:30]  Million Man March, right.  It's about as simple a movie as you could ask for.  Cheap, cheap video camera, and it's just single shots of dialogues.  It's fucking great, because it's low in scope, and it's not trying to do much.  Right.  It's just some dialogue, and there's no lighting, and some scenes are hard to look at, because  they're so dark.  I was on a bus that went...  And it's...  Oh, jeez.  ...Man March.  I was...  So that must mean this movie's good.  Because you took a bus once.  But he cared about the movie.  I went to the Million Man March on a bus ride.  Louie was making a point.  Okay, so then you're right.  It's a good movie.  You're right. 
[01:41:00]  It's a good movie.  Your point being...  The point is that there are many, many movies that do what he says he's doing, which is  let's do away with editing.  Let's say editing is a pretense.  The dogma school.  Editing is a trick.  Let's take the school...  The tricks out.  You know, let's not have...  A lot of people do that.  That's not what this is.  The caring.  The caring about it.  Let's take that out.  This is just no effort.  The effort.  Let's just remove any effort and work that goes behind it.  The dogma people that you just mentioned.  Exactly.  And it's even more offensive that you have the education and know better. 
[01:41:30]  I'm talking to the dogma people.  Because sometimes you see a movie like Out of the Mouth of Babes.  You know, you see a movie made by some people that didn't know what the fuck they were doing  and there's a beauty to looking at it because of how tragically fucked up it was.  I didn't know how to do it.  That's even better.  See, that I thought...  This isn't even that.  I thought I was going to get a little of that when I watched this.  I was going like, wow, maybe this will be fucked up enough where it's hysterical. 
[01:42:00]  But it just was fucked up.  And it went on and on.  He's deep.  Wow.  I think he's rimming.  Poor guy.  I love how Jimmy jumps when you wake him up.  He's my right-hand man right now.  I'm just doing this.  It's just like...  I don't want to wreck the movie, man.  You're doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing when you watch this movie.  Yes.  Jimmy, I just touched your lips twice with my hand.  You didn't feel it.  Did you?  That's a sleepy word.  Yeah, I was in his tiny hole, too.  Gap in consciousness seems to be with you. 
[01:42:30]  I need a little bit of sugar on a piece of stuff.  Louie, and I...  This guy can't even defend you ironically without falling asleep.  Truthfully, you're busting my balls.  Truthfully, you're busting my balls.  You're not really giving me the benefit of the doubt.  It's like if you walked in out of the rain into a theater and saw this movie.  If I go back out into the rain, if it was raining AIDS, I'd go back out and open my mouth.  I'd look up at it like a turkey and drown in AIDS rain. 
[01:43:00]  After watching three frames of this shit, I'd run back out into the acid rain and let it eat my body.  That's busting balls.  That's busting balls.  I'm sorry.  Thank God Louie was here for this today because we didn't know how to handle this horseshit.  Paulo, I think we're going to wrap up.  Yes, sir.  It's the worst of 2009.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You just heard a long ordeal of Paulo playing his movie in studio and Louis C.K. just destroying him, which saved a bit.  Yeah, thank God Louis C.K. was there because otherwise it would have just been a bunch of guys watching a terrible movie. 
[01:43:30]  And we have an interview that we did with Paul right after this whole ordeal.  I don't like how you call him Paul.  With Paul.  What do I call him?  Paulo.  That's his character name.  Here's the Paulo interview.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  And I'm Sam from Opie and Anthony.  Of course.  Obviously.  And we're here with Paul O.  Hello, Paul O.  Your life's in the movie.  How are you?  How are you? 
[01:44:00]  The director, the creator.  Did you write it too?  Did you write Gap?  There's a discussion about whether it was written or whether it was conceived in a slapdash fashion.  That's true.  As we learn in this segment, there was no writer because there was no script.  That's right.  But if anyone wrote it, he did.  He also starred in it.  And if you haven't figured out by now, we're featuring a bit here with Paulo about his movie Gap.  And Louis C.K. is in studio giving his critique of the film.  Yes.  He had never seen it.  He came in cold. 
[01:44:30]  And we put it on for him and for opening it to watch along with us.  And, Paul, how did you feel that review went?  I was actually very happy with the situation because Louis C.K. took the devil's advocate position, which, of course, he had to.  Somebody had to.  And then, of course, Jimmy Norton took the defense of the film.  I think he did an admirable job because I think it is very defendable.  The movie is defendable?  That's its best quality?  I think what you have to understand about this movie is that it's controversial.  It is a fulcrum for discussion. 
[01:45:00]  And so that's what we had there was discussion back and forth.  Well, I'm sure a lot of you own Gap.  If you don't own Gap by now, don't bother.  But here is...  Bullshit!  We should at least be fair and give him a way to try to plug it and make some means to this end here.  It's gapthefilm.com.  There is no other movie like this.  Swear to God, you will be happy you own this.  Gapthemovie.com.  Gapthefilm.com?  Gapthemovie.com.  Gapthevideo.com.  Gap the movie.  No spaces.  Gapthemovie.com.  Right.  You heard it. 
[01:45:30]  Gapthemovie.com.  And here is Opie.  G-A-P.  G-A-P.  G-O-T.  Is it that series that they spoof other horror movies and comedies and stuff like that?  Right, right.  That's exactly what it is.  Leslie Nielsen's in them.  Yeah, they're hilarious.  And a Paquin.  My life is fucked up.  You please, if you have any heart in your body, please buy this movie.  Now, the movie's kind of cheap, right?  It's not expensive?  Not expensive, no.  But that's how...  That was the reason we did this movie.  I have dozens of movies swimming around in my head.  The reason we did this is because it was a cheap...  It was supposed to look cheap.  How much is the movie going for right now? 
[01:46:00]  $17.99.  Oh, Jesus.  You know...  Is that a two-disc set?  Does it come with a digital copy for my iPod?  This is actually the collector's edition disc, the director's cut, whatever.  But, I mean, the point is it was for the members of the O&A, R&F community.  Paul, one more question about Garbage the Movie here.  Gap the Movie.  What are the special features on the DVD that you will get?  Lots of people, you know, members of the show.  You've got Stalker Patty, you've got No Filter Paul, you've got Linnae from Rana Fez, you've got Eastside Dave, 
[01:46:30]  you've got Kielo, of course, my ex-late wife, and my new, soon-to-be ex-wife, not late, Melissa, Mellie, and me, of course, in the movie.  So there's all those people behind the scenes.  I thought Dave wasn't in the movie.  I thought you cut him out.  Well, he's in the extras, but we had to shorten the scene.  So that's not in the movie.  He was shortened.  Of course.  They had to shorten Eastside Dave's scene to make room for 75 minutes of No Filter Paul saying the C word.  So Dave's hosting the extras.  I guess so. 
[01:47:00]  We included his entire scene.  And believe me, I believe Dave has a future in film.  He's an excellent character.  Just not in your film because you cut him out.  It just happened that way because it was almost he mocked the film, the way he was acting.  But I think he's got an ex's face reads on film.  And go to GapKidsTheMovie.com, see if you can order.  GapTheMovie.com.  But you can find E-Rock or myself on PalTalk or the message boards, and we'll just burn you a copy for free.  Sure.  You can't do that because it's got that protection on it.  Oh, Steve's got software that we can get around that. 
[01:47:30]  You can find it on BitTorrent, too, I'm sure.  I'm sure it's on BitTorrent.  Fuck, you better not.  Or if you want to buy the GapTheMovie.com.  If you want to order it, GapTheMovie.com.  Right.  So enjoy GapTheMovie with Paolo.  Hey, this is Paolo.  Your life's a movie.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am Sam.  I am E-Rock.  And with us is the world famous, the now infamous Bobo of the David and Bobo Show.  Our guest booking just keeps going through the roof, Sam. 
[01:48:00]  I know.  Somehow we get all these celebrities.  Bobo, how are you doing today?  I'm doing fine today.  Basically, what we're doing is going over some of the worst Opie and Anthony bits of all time.  And by that, we mean the best Opie and Anthony bits of all time.  And Bobo, you made it on the list with the very first David and Bobo Show.  Yep, I still remember that first David and Bobo Show.  I have to admit, David sounded like a police interrogator that time.  Yeah, it did turn into more of an interview than a show. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, he really likes saying your name over and over, Bobo.  Yeah, I remember that whole day.  It just kept ringing in my head the whole day.  Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo.  It just kept ringing in my head in my sleep.  Since this first show came on, did people start to recognize you?  Did you start to build a little bit of fame?  Yeah, I get some people that recognize me.  Mostly people that know me.  Yeah.  And I got some comments on my MySpace.  Ah.  Yeah, so I get some comments on my MySpace and a couple people I know who are also fans who heard and said, 
[01:49:00]  Oh, Danny, we heard you.  We love the David and Bobo Show.  Of course, Danny is your real name.  Bobo.  Yeah, that's correct.  That's my real name.  So what was going through your head when Opie and Anthony first proposed to you, Bobo, today?  Because that's what happened.  And you were just an audience member like the movie Rockstar.  You're just an audience member.  Then all of a sudden, Opie and Anthony put their hands down into the crowd and bring you up on stage because now you're the rockstar. 
[01:49:30]  What was going through your head, Bobo?  This was, like, impressive.  I thought, oh, wow, this is a shocker.  Yeah.  And how do you think you did for your first time, Bobo?  I think I did good the first time.  Yeah, Bobo, you did very well, Bobo.  But David just kept saying your name over and over, Bobo.  And what do you think of that, Bobo?  Isn't that annoying, Bobo?  Yeah, it was annoying.  The thing, the freaking thing was getting stuck in my head.  Well, thanks to David, thanks to Opie and Anthony, and thanks to everybody else, you're a radio star. 
[01:50:00]  Yep, that's right.  And I'm glad that we get to share with everybody, E-Rock, on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of 2009.  All right, welcome to the Dave and Bobo Show, the first-ever edition.  I'm Dave, and we're here with Bobo.  What's up, Bobo?  Everything's going great.  Everything's going great, David.  Thanks a lot, Bobo.  And this is the first-ever edition of the show, and I want to get to know you a little bit.  So, first of all, you're Bobo. 
[01:50:30]  What gave you the name Bobo, if I may ask?  My sister's been calling me that since she was a baby, and it just stuck with me.  She still calls me that to this day.  Well, why does she call you Bobo?  I mean, she could have picked, like, dickface, or she could have picked, like, clown, or whatever.  Like, why does she call you Bobo?  Where does that come from?  I don't know.  When she was little, that's how she said brother.  Should brother means Bobo?  How does that work?  I have no idea.  If I could figure out baby language, I'd be a freaking genius.  Yeah, do you consider yourself a genius there, Bobo?  Well, I don't know a genius, but if I freaking knew that language, I'd be a freaking genius. 
[01:51:00]  What language do you know, Bobo?  The only language I can speak is English.  You can't speak any other languages?  Nope.  What about Bobo language?  That's the same as English.  Oh, that's the same as English, yeah?  Yeah, the phone number 866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's right, Bobo, 866-WOW-1-WOW.  There you go.  So, did you have a pretty good relationship there with your sister back in the day? 
[01:51:30]  She's only 13, so...  Oh, she's younger than you.  Yeah, she's younger than me.  All right, so what made her start calling you Bobo?  She couldn't mention any other name.  Like, why that name?  As I said before, I have no idea.  That's how she said brother.  All right, I got you.  So, do you hang out with your sister a lot?  Are you too close?  I see her every so often.  She's going out a lot.  I don't know.  Are you going out a lot?  What are you going to do this week?  That's what I get to.  It's the weekend coming up, you know, Bobo. 
[01:52:00]  So, what are you going to do this weekend?  You got any big plans, man?  What are you going to do?  What's your typical weekend, Bobo?  What are you going to do?  This weekend, I might be heading out to Long Island to pay visit my cousin.  As they do sometimes on the weekend.  All right, hold on there a minute, Bobo.  We're going to go to the phones.  We've got Brooklyn Ace online, too.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up, man?  Just out of curiosity, David, first of all, you're not a radio host.  You're maybe a backroom guy.  And are you going to ask Bobo the same questions I want to ask him for the rest of the conversation?  I'm just curious. 
[01:52:30]  This is our first show, and I want to get to know the co-host.  We just had this discussion.  We just listened to this.  Why do they call you Bobo?  Because my sister said that.  What do you open up with?  How come they call you Bobo?  Come on, David.  Well, I'm just curious.  I want to get to know the co-host.  I don't know the first thing about this guy.  I'm interested.  I want to know him.  So I'm asking him a bunch of questions.  You got a problem with that?  Why don't you come around and run the show if you got a problem?  I could do a hell of a lot better job than you could, David.  You think you could?  Anyone could.  Neo could.  Neo?  Oh, whatever.  Forget you.  Goodbye.  Okay, we got another caller. 
[01:53:00]  Victor on line three.  What's up, Victor?  How are you?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  What's up, man?  I cannot believe they are giving you valuable fucking air time.  This is unbelievable.  You are like a, you're a dope, man.  I'll tell you what.  If you do midnight radio for insomniacs, you would be perfect.  How dare you?  That's not, how dare you?  Enough of this caller.  Hang up on that caller.  Yeah, hang up on that caller. 
[01:53:30]  Darn, yeah.  What do you think about this, Bobo?  That's pretty rude about all these callers, don't you think, man?  Yeah, it is.  We got Mitch on line eight.  Mitch, how are you doing?  Hello, Mitch?  You there, Mitch?  Hello?  Hello?  What's up, man?  Hello, David.  If you had a little freaking radio presence, maybe you'd know I was here.  I didn't even know you came to me.  I didn't hear you.  You didn't hear Bobo?  He went to you.  So what's up, man?  Nothing much.  He's not saying the goddamn word, Bobo, already.  We know his freaking name.  You suck. 
[01:54:00]  Good for you, man.  Goodbye.  All right.  So, Bobo, what are your plans this weekend, man?  What are you going to do?  Well, this weekend, I'm going to visit my cousin.  I got a DVD box, got the Lost DVD box that I've been trying to get him into Lost for quite a while.  Oh, you like the show Lost.  You're a big fan?  Do you watch every week, every day, Lost, when it's on every week?  Every week.  I've been seeing every episode since the beginning.  Since the beginning?  Wow.  So you're a big fan, huh?  What do you like about Lost?  Like, what do you like about that?  Do you think it's a good show, man? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, it is.  It just makes you want to watch the next episode.  Like, wish it was next week right now.  All right.  Cool, man.  Hold on for a minute.  We got Matt on line three.  Yo, Matt, what's up, man?  Hey, Dave.  Yes, what's up, man?  Can you say just a word besides proceeded?  He proceeded to, then I proceeded to.  Okay, so why don't you come on the show and you say whatever you want to say?  And he proceeded to.  Good for you, man.  That I proceeded to, then she proceeded to, then I proceeded to.  Yes, you proceeded to do a lot of things, yes.  But you didn't proceed to.  Did you proceed to host this radio show, Matt? 
[01:55:00]  I don't think so, no.  No, I didn't proceed to answer your question, no.  No, I can't proceed to go fuck myself.  I can proceed to have you go fuck yourself.  Bobo, I'm going to interject here, Bobo.  What do you think about this caller, huh?  Then he proceeded to...  Then I proceeded to... 
[01:55:30]  Shut up, man. Continue, Bobo.  I proceeded to proceed.  I hung up on this guy already. Good enough of this guy, Matt.  Bobo, what are your thoughts about this?  Then I proceeded to proceed to more.  Let the dude get a word in, all right?  Let the kid talk for a minute. Come on, now.  Bobo, what do you think?  Then he can not proceed anymore.  You know what? I'll proceed to...  If you don't shut up, I'll proceed to hang up on you.  You proceed to take it.  Yes, I do.  Bobo, what do you think about all these callers making fun of me and saying proceed, Bobo? 
[01:56:00]  This sounds like that WABC guy, that guy in WABC that goes...  Yeah, I proceeded to say that.  Wait, Bobo, what ABC guys? I'm not familiar with this guy.  I don't remember the name of this guy, but this guy would always like,  yo, get the F off my phones!  Was it on radio or was it on TV? What was this?  It was on radio. I forgot the name of this guy.  That's all right. One moment. One moment there, Bobo.  We got Dave on line 7. Dave, what's up, man? 
[01:56:30]  Hello, Dave? Dave, you're on.  Hey, Dave, how you doing?  Yes, hey, what's up, man?  Do you know a fucking monkey with a pencil could do your job as you proceed to do and ask the same fucking question?  Good for you, man.  Good for you, man.  Good for you.  Proceed. Proceed.  Yeah, good for you, man. All right.  So, Bobo, what are you telling me about this guy on ABC radio?  This guy would just go if he felt like it.  He'd just, if the guy didn't, if the person didn't agree with him, he'd just, like, go and yell, like, get the, get off my phones! 
[01:57:00]  Oh, did he?  Yeah, yeah, he would. I forgot the name of this guy, but the guy, the guy...  Was that one of your favorite radio personalities back in the day? You listened to him all the time?  I don't know if he was my favorite, but...  Who was your favorite radio personality? Do you have any favorite radio shows you always listened to?  I don't know. I used to, back in the day, I would, of course, I would listen to Mike and the Mad Dog in the afternoons.  Oh, Mike and the Mad Dog? You're a big sports fan?  Yeah, man. As you can see, I'm a huge Mets fan. 
[01:57:30]  I see that. You got a big Mets cap on that. Your favorite baseball team there in the Mets?  Yeah, I've been a Mets fan for years.  All right. One moment there, Bobo. We got Kevin on line one. Kevin, what's up, man?  The phones are ringing off the hook. Wow. Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  I'm Bobo.  I want to hear what it sounds like when you two guys are eating pussy together.  You got two girls, just the two of you. You got a little orgy going on.  Playing some kissy face on some pussy. I want to hear what it sounds like. Same time.  All right. Bobo, you got that? 
[01:58:00]  Well, there's one thing I'd say. Ask and you shall receive.  All right, great. Let's hear it.  What you doing there, Bobo? What's that voice you're doing there?  That's your voice there? Your voice for kissing a girl or making out with a girl?  Is it a mic? Is it pussy a microphone?  Yeah, that's pretty much the sound of it.  Okay, cool, Bobo.  Dude, keep going. Keep going. Make the noise. Make the noise.  Okay, I'd do that, too. Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Whoa, Bobo. That's how you'd get in?  You'd get in there with all that. Would you be giggling, though?  No, I don't think I'd be giggling.  I heard a little giggling in your voice.  How'd you be interacting with that girl?  I want to hear it, David. It's making my dick hard.  Oh, no, Bobo. That's kind of sick, Bobo.  What do you think about that, making the guy's dick hard?  Isn't that sick, Bobo?  Does that turn you on? Does that turn you on?  A male caller is getting his dick hard.  Does that turn you on there, Bobo? 
[01:59:00]  No, that would make me puke.  Puke? Why would you puke?  You don't like that?  That's not comfortable for you?  I have no idea why the heck the guy would get his dick hard by the sound of that.  What is comfortable for you, Bobo?  What is comfortable for you?  Bobo, what is comfortable for you?  If that's not turning you on, what would?  A simple, a good porn film.  Oh, a good porn film. 
[01:59:30]  Okay, hold on there, man. We got Mike on line 12.  Yo, Mike, what's up, man?  Hey, why don't you...  You're supposed to have a co-host there.  It's a fucking co-host.  You're not interviewing the guy that's supposed to be your co-host.  You're fucking talking to Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, Bobo, and like you're interviewing him.  Talk about something.  Get a fucking subject, and then fucking talk about it.  You don't know how to carry on a conversation. 
[02:00:00]  This is Bobo we're talking about here.  This is Bobo we're talking...  You're a fucking retard.  You don't fucking...  Hey, Bobo, what do you think about...  Bobo, what do you think about the microphone for your face?  Bobo, what do you think about...  This is...  This is...  What do you think about fucking shitting?  This is Bobo we're talking with here.  Pick a topic and fucking talk to the guy about it.  You think so?  I'm a fucking retard.  Why don't you host a show with Bobo, all right?  And then you see what you can talk about with him, all right?  All right?  Yeah, I thought so. You hung up, huh? 
[02:00:30]  That's right. That's what I thought, man.  Great. Good for you.  I don't know. These callers are being...  These callers are being really ridiculous.  Bobo, what do you think about these callers, huh?  They're being pretty ridiculous.  They're being pretty ridiculous, all right.  But I have to admit, though, that does make interesting radio hearing these guys.  All right. So, okay. Okay, fine.  So, you want to talk about a topic?  Do you have any topics you're interested in, Bobo?  How about Rihanna?  Rihanna's on the front page of the cover of the New York Post.  Say, you heard about this whole story, though? 
[02:01:00]  Rihanna and Chris Brown?  Yeah, I heard about it, all right.  I heard about it, right?  I haven't seen any of the photos of it yet, but I could imagine...  Yeah, I looked at the newspaper.  She's right on top of the cover.  This guy, Chris Brown, brutally...  They were dating.  You know who they are, right?  First of all, you know who they are, right, Bobo?  Of course I know who they are.  They're big R&B stars, R&B rap pop stars.  They're big stars, big singers.  And they're dating.  And Rihanna is getting brutally beaten up by Chris Brown.  She's taken it from them. 
[02:01:30]  Look at all this...  I mean, you've seen all the scars and bruises on the face of Rihanna.  What do you think about all this?  I think this is terrible.  This is the wrong way to go.  How are they going to get far in life or have a relation?  This is bad for the music industry, I personally think.  What do you think about all this?  Yeah, it is.  To me, it amazes me they're still dating.  She must really like an ass-kicking if she's still going with him.  You think so?  Yeah, Bobo, if I may ask before that...  You know Mike, the guy that just called before.  What do you think about this guy, Mike, that just called before?  If I may ask, real quick. 
[02:02:00]  I'm sorry to interject about the Rihanna story, but real quick.  I think a lot of people are just getting used to this  because this is just a new thing that they're just hearing this.  Because, after all, this is the first show.  Right.  This is the debut, so of course...  Right, so...  But did you think he was like a real asshole?  And you think he was like a real asshole?  I think that guy was a personal asshole.  Like, he's ruining our show and making fun of our show like this.  That fucking idiot asshole was ruining our show and saying rude things,  telling us how to run our show.  This is the Dave and Bobo show. 
[02:02:30]  Come on.  Come on, Bobo.  You gotta have some stuff about it.  Like, what do you want to do to, like, if Mike for some reason...  Pretend Mike was in the studio right now, the call.  What would you want to do to him right now?  He was ruining my fun of your show and was trying to tell you what to do.  What would you want to do to him right now for what he said to you on the show?  What would you want to do to him, Bobo?  I'd say...  Ramon!  What?  Somebody get...  That's what you would do?  Why don't you take a fist and knock it to his head and beat him up  and fucking punch him out and beat the shit out of that guy for all of what he said to you? 
[02:03:00]  Heck yeah, I'd probably go...  I'd probably knock the guy out after.  You'd knock the guy out?  But what was that before?  What was that noise you were making before?  Come on.  You wouldn't just, like, go there and make noises.  You'd fucking punch him in the mouth.  You'd beat him up.  You'd knock him down.  You'd bust him out.  You'd send him to the hospital.  You'd want to kill that guy, wouldn't you?  He was rude on your debut of the show.  You had a rude caller like that.  That's pretty rude, man.  If I admit that, I'd want him to look like a UFC victim.  A UFC victim.  There you go, man.  You'd kick him in the cunt, wouldn't you, Bobo? 
[02:03:30]  I know I would kick that guy in the cunt.  I think I'd go one step further.  I think I'd bring out the old flamethrower.  The old flamethrower?  Yeah, I'd fuck that guy in his mouth, wouldn't you?  I don't know about that, but...  You wouldn't do that, Bobo?  I think I'd probably bring out the whole rocket launcher of the guy.  That's what you'd do?  Yeah, I'd bring out the rocket launcher.  All right, these callers are getting pretty brutal with us for the first entire show.  That's over? 
[02:04:00]  That guy would be pretty brutal for the first entire show.  You know, Bobo?  Yep, I know what you mean.  Looks like we got the Mary Brothers music.  We got to finish up.  Yeah, we definitely do got to finish up.  Well, Bobo was a good first show.  I enjoyed it.  So, once again, this has been the Dave and Bobo Show.  Have a good weekend, everybody.  Goodbye, guys.  Bobo?  Bobo, say goodbye to the callers.  All right.  Bye, callers.  It's the worst of 2009.  Hey, it's the worst of Opie and Anthony, and you just heard the David and Bobo Show, and 
[02:04:30]  we are here with Intern David.  Yes, we are lucky enough.  This, of course, is Sam and E-Rock from Opie and Anthony.  And Intern David, you got to host your very own radio show.  Yes, I certainly did.  That's correct.  How do you think it went, David?  I don't think it went too good, honestly.  Why is that?  We got a lot of calls, though.  The phones were ringing.  The phones were lighting up and stuff, and the callers weren't very happy with what was  going on in the show.  They were disagreeing and saying it was horrible.  I should talk about news topics instead of, you know, just interviewing Bobo. 
[02:05:00]  No, yeah.  We just heard it along with all the other people listening.  After re-listening to it, do you think there's some improvements you could have made?  It depends, though.  I mean, part of the, I think, to me, I don't mean to be rude or anything, but part of the  reason why I think it went so poorly is because of my co-host.  Bobo, you'd say, would be the problem.  I would say so.  I felt uncomfortable with doing, like, a real show, like, talking about news topics or  talking about, like, what was on the front cover of the story, like, the Rihanna, Chris  Brown story.  I felt uncomfortable talking about it with him. 
[02:05:30]  Did you feel like you were carrying the show?  Uh, I, I feel like I was carrying the show a little bit, but I was also uncomfortable  because it was off the cuff.  I didn't know I was going to do this.  Is it fair to say that you didn't even really give Bobo a lot of time to speak?  You, you kind of, uh, monopolized that whole conversation.  I, I'd have to agree with that.  I did kind of monopolize the conversation.  And why did you do that?  I did that because I felt that Bobo is, has, is not really very good, meant for radio  or not very good to talk to on the radio.  I didn't, you know, I felt like I wasn't able to give him a chance. 
[02:06:00]  I understand why ONA wants him to do it because I am who I am and all, um, Bobo has, uh,  certain disabilities that make him, uh, turn out weird to other people.  So I understand why they wanted him on the air, but.  But the bottom line is he's not David Freed.  He is not David Freed.  But if it was any other normal, if it was any other normal human being, like any other  fan, I think I probably could have had a normal conversation with him and talked about  any news topic or anything.  Well, that's the thing people are failing to realize, that you're sitting here a professionally 
[02:06:30]  trained broadcaster.  You've had this internship, you've had training.  I wouldn't say I'm a professional broadcaster.  You're a professionally trained broadcaster.  Okay, if you want to say that.  Professionally trained.  If you want to say that, sure.  I mean, CSB isn't just for clowns and jokers.  Tell that to some people.  Artie Lang, right?  Just kidding.  He's a joker.  He's a comedian.  It's just, I'm just kidding, David.  Artie Lang went to CSB.  He did.  Yes.  But now you are forced to do a show with someone who's just off the street.  As a professionally trained broadcaster, do you think that you held up your end? 
[02:07:00]  I don't know.  I have to agree.  I might have not, I might not have held up my end, but I think I did that on, I think  that was on purpose, could have been on purpose.  You, you, you threw in the towel on purpose?  You threw it?  Well, I didn't throw it.  No, I definitely didn't throw it.  But when I found out that I, that I was going to do this, this, this segment with Bobo  or this Dave and Bobo show, I went with in my mind, well, this guy is, is who he is.  He has issues, disabilities.  And I pretty much was going to be like, I want to get to know this person, find out why 
[02:07:30]  he has the name he has, what he's all about.  But what really came out in the show was your ability to act as an insult comic, the way  you just came at all the callers and just boom, boom, got him back, got him back.  Where's the quick wit come from?  The quick wit comes from me being annoyed and pissed off at the fact that these are,  these callers are ruining my show and saying negative things.  I don't like to take negativity from, from callers and stuff.  When I hear negativity, I'm going to go back and be negative to them.  You threatened to fuck one caller in the mouth.  I did threaten to fuck, I did threaten to do that. 
[02:08:00]  I threatened him because he was rude to me and ruining my show.  I'm going to be rude back to the caller.  Caller's rude to me, I'll be rude back to the caller.  That's what I'm talking about.  David, as we wrap up here, give us your, uh, your final thoughts, your overall impression  of the entire show.  Um, my overall final thoughts of the show was that, uh, shitstorm.  It was a shitstorm.  It didn't go as well as I ever planned it to go.  I went pretty bad, I'd have to say.  Would you ever do this again?  Um, I don't think I'd ever do a David and Bobo show ever again, no.  Would you just do the David Fried show?  I would do the David Fried show. 
[02:08:30]  The only, the only way I'd ever do the David and Bobo show again is if Opie, Anthony, or  Jim Norton told me to do the David and Bobo show again.  If they told me to, then of course I'd have to listen to them and do it.  And finally, in closing, how shitty is your life?  My life is very, very shitty.  All right, cool.  Thanks a lot, David.  David, how can the listeners reach out to you?  Where do they find you at?  The listeners can reach out to me by going to my Facebook page.  And they can constantly, they can look up David Fried, D-A-V-I-D-F-R-I-E-D, and look  it up on Facebook and request me as a friend if they so choose.  Okay, well there it is.  Intern David, uh, wrapping up the David and Bobo show here on the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:09:00]  It's the worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm Iraq, he's Sam.  Sam, Big Apple Comic Con happened.  No.  This is part one, and we start with just, uh, some stories about your behavior at Comic Con.  Which I didn't find inappropriate at all, but apparently...  That's because you're a goon.  No, it was fine, but you, you had to amp it up a little bit.  You were going around collecting audio for interviews.  And you were going around collecting toys for your collection. 
[02:09:30]  And signatures and photos.  Yeah, for some reason, everyone was told Sam and Iraq are going to Comic Con for the show.  You were not there for the show.  You were there for Iraq.  Exactly.  I was there for the show.  That was how it was set before we even decided to do this.  Then how come every email said Sam and Eric are going to Comic Con?  Because Steve is an idiot.  Oh.  He was in the right.  Well, then, here's me making fun of you, Rock.  And, um, we talked about photos and signature price gouging.  And then Big Cab also called in to correct us on everything we had wrong. 
[02:10:00]  That's right.  It's number 28 on the Worst of 2009 Countdown.  It's the Worst of 2009.  Hey, Sam's back in studio.  Thank God, I say.  Well, he was at Comic Con, or Comic Con.  How do you say it?  Well, this was, uh, the Big Apple Con.  The Big Apple Con.  The Big Apple Con.  But technically, it's Comic Con.  Comic Con.  I think Comic Con.  I think Comic Con convention.  And you took E-Rock to help you with some, um, celebrity interviews.  Throughout the week, Steve kept mentioning to bosses and stuff that Sam and Eric were going 
[02:10:30]  to Comic Con, which I took umbrage with because I knew going into this thing that I would be  going to do interviews and stuff, and Eric would just be distracted by the goodies the  whole time.  By the goodies?  What kind of goodies?  Did he get all distracted?  He, well...  What kind of horrible stuff did he get at this thing?  Well, there's all...  Everything.  You can get everything.  This was a giant Comic Con.  And Eric kept getting distracted in the toy sections.  Can we get E-Rock in here, please? 
[02:11:00]  I went with Jess...  I don't know.  Can we?  How big's the door?  Jesus.  I went with Jess in the morning before Eric got there, and then apparently Jess had to  go do something.  Ah!  And then Eric had to come in and fill in for her.  Oh, but you're not suggesting that you spent the rest of the afternoon with his fiancÃ©e.  Well, I'm not...  He's not my fiancÃ©e, just long-term.  What?  I thought it was...  I thought you guys were going to get married.  If you do a little investigating, you could see exactly what she was doing Saturday night. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, shit, yo.  She might be in one of my videos.  Really?  If you look closely.  Didn't realize she was a hockey fan.  Oh, shit, yo.  I know you're not, so I invited her.  Apparently, she's more of a hockey fan than Comic Con by day and Jersey All-Pro Wrestling  by night.  Yeah, I would say so.  The fucking listeners, man.  They pick up on everything.  Somebody picked up on...  Are you serious?  ...that she was in one of the videos really quickly.  I don't even know what she looks like.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  E-Rock.  Hello.  You were distracted by the shiny toys? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  How many times did I have to yell at you,  Eric, we're going.  Come on, Eric.  We're here to work.  We're here to work.  It was during the downtime when you weren't interviewing anybody,  so I was like, oh, let me just look right here.  What toys did you see that you liked?  There was a lot of them.  Tell me one or two.  Tell me which He-Man character were you looking for.  I bought Skeletor.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Who's the less known character that you were looking for?  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Moss Man.  Will you shut up?  What is fucking Moss Man?  He's part of the Masters of the Universe. 
[02:12:30]  Wait, that's distracting.  That is amazing that people were able to figure that out.  There's your...  There's like four pictures of her online.  How do they know what she looks like?  There's a girl in one of my videos.  That's her right there.  Why was she with you at a hockey game?  She didn't want to go to wrestling after Comic-Con, so she left Comic-Con early and said she's  going to the mall in Long Island at an Islanders game, which she's never watched a hockey game  in 15 years.  But how is she...  Was it coincidentally enough that she's right next to Hope?  Yes. 
[02:13:00]  Coincidentally, she was sitting next to him and went to the mall with him.  Yes.  Coincidentally.  Wow.  And he drove her, coincidentally.  Wait, where was your wife?  Was she there?  Yeah, she's there.  Oh, really?  He's got one of those things going on, apparently.  Wow.  Didn't know how this...  At one point it was, you know, two pairs, and then all of a sudden it's just...  Damn!  I know you don't like sports, so I saved you the trouble.  Oh, great.  You and the Rock hate sports.  I was doing work for, actually, this show that you're the host of while you decided to 
[02:13:30]  hit up the Mall and the Islanders game with My Lady.  Wow.  I thought you were kidding until I saw the video.  No.  No.  And how did people...  Oh, look at where poor Sam is.  How did you get a picture of old Opie?  No, that's...  Oh, God.  That's Lex Luger, the total package.  Oh, that's exactly how I'm going to look.  The total package.  Yes.  We were talking sports, and E-Rock came in this morning and goes,  Oh, sports.  Great.  And then walked out.  You don't like sports at all? 
[02:14:00]  I like hockey now and then, but that's about it.  No, Angela.  Well, she got me into it, but if it wasn't for that, I'd not be into any sports.  She's a big hockey fan.  She loves those...  Eric used to be a Mets fan, and that went away.  Went away.  Was she happy you got Mossman?  Was she psyched?  Oh, yeah.  Get back to that, because we were looking at the video.  We were distracted.  So what happened?  Yeah, he was...  He bought the toy Mossman?  What's Mossman?  Come on, Eric.  We're going.  We're here to work.  Let's do some interviews.  And he was never behind me, because he was at the toy area, the toy booths, buying Mossman. 
[02:14:30]  How big was the Mossman you bought?  He's small.  How much?  About four inches.  Oh, it was ten bucks.  Where are you going to put it?  With the rest of my collection.  Which is where?  Collection.  I know where it should be.  In the big green storage thing behind the apartment complex.  Do you get just shitty toys all over your apartment?  Shitty toys all over...  That's true.  Yes, you do.  They're not shitty toys.  Of course they are.  Jesus.  Most of them are in storage, but the ones that I have aren't shitty.  You're a hoarder.  They're stuff I had from when I was a kid. 
[02:15:00]  I just never got rid of.  It's a prized possession, and then we'll decide if it's shitty or not.  What's the bestest thing you'll have?  I'll give you a chance.  What's the one thing you can't lose?  Wait.  We'll get rid of it.  That's the formula at work.  That's the formula at work.  What's the one thing?  If you lost this or...  It's not really a toy.  It's a big hand autographed thing from Matt Groening from The Simpsons. 
[02:15:30]  He was upset.  That's pretty cool.  He was upset because he went to...  How can we beat him up on that one?  Easily.  He went to one of the toy booths, and he was upset because the Ned Flanders action figure  that he wanted was too expensive.  How much was it?  They wanted 25 bucks, but it's all bent up and everything.  I wasn't going to pay for that.  Where do you put these things?  All over your bedroom and stuff?  No.  The Simpsons stuff?  They're in the bathtub with them.  No, the Simpsons stuff is hanging on a wall in one of the rooms of my apartment. 
[02:16:00]  The Simpsons stuff is cool.  I have four rooms.  Big Kev's on the line.  How do we get to Big Kev?  Big Kev, what's up, buddy?  I heard something about shitty toys all over an apartment.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Biggity better call.  Hi, Big Kev.  I thought maybe you were talking about me.  I just don't understand that culture, to be honest with you.  I know you don't.  I know it's huge.  I know, I know, I know these things do very well, but I just can't be bothered. 
[02:16:30]  Just like E-Rock can't be bothered with sports, even though he was at the Yankee game over the weekend.  I was offered a ticket to go.  Huh?  I can't understand being a Mets or an Islanders fan.  At this point, Kev, I can't understand it myself.  So there we go.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I respect it somewhat.  Did Ant talk about him holding some very expensive comic books while he was there?  Oh, my goodness.  What did you hold?  Did I hold some expensive fucking comic books? 
[02:17:00]  We went to a comic book booth there.  And wow, these guys are back there with suits on and everything.  Everybody else is...  Exclusive dealer.  Yes, yes.  And what were some of the amazing comics that I was shown?  I gave Anthony a Detective Comics number 27, which is the first appearance of Batman.  First appearance of Batman.  So?  Well...  No, can I...  I have to say, I'm not even trying to make jokes.  So?  Yeah, yeah.  So until you ask the price. 
[02:17:30]  What kind of condition?  How much would you assume...  All right.  How much would you assume that that would go for?  What was inflation?  It was 10 cents when it was bought.  All right.  What's inflation?  $5.75.  Okay.  $5.75.  Let me guess.  Hold on.  Jimmy's going to guess.  I have a question.  What kind of condition was it in?  It was a 4.5, Jimmy.  That's mint?  Jimmy knows this stuff.  4.5 out of 10.  Oh, okay.  No, I don't know.  I don't know a point.  I know mint, near mint.  So it's like good.  Is that considered good?  That's the cover.  Slightly above, but yeah. 
[02:18:00]  And it was a restored copy.  Which means what?  Which means that professional people had done some restoration work on mostly the cover  and perhaps a few pages on the inside.  Oh, okay.  So it's doctored.  Doctored?  Well, we prefer restored.  I would say, to play conservative, $4,827,000.  It might as well have been.  No, I'm going to guess, say $15,000.  Okay, it was $45,000. 
[02:18:30]  $45,000.  Wow.  For what?  What?  Like, what do you do with it?  Well, I put it in my den.  Yeah, you could do that.  No, I did not buy it.  What was it being stored in?  I would put it in one of my bathrooms.  Yeah, put it in the shitter.  Put it on the shitter.  Jimmy, what did you say?  What was it being stored in?  Not just a plastic fucking bag.  No, it's what we refer to as a comic coffin.  It's a plastic case that is not intended to be opened. 
[02:19:00]  It can be opened, but it's not intended to be opened.  It's hard plastic.  And if you shake it around, will the magazine shake?  Absolutely not.  Wait, so you can't even read it?  No, it's not for reading.  Obi, at this point, there have been so many reprints of that story, you could easily find  one in a...  Yeah.  But if I'm spending $45,000, I want to read that copy.  No.  Like I said, you could open it, you could leaf through it, but you run the risk of your 
[02:19:30]  $45,000 comic becoming $38,000.  Would it make you really nervous if I was eating it while I was having salsa and chips and drinking  coffee?  Drinking coffee.  If it was mine, it wouldn't be anywhere near you.  You'd just lift your mind.  Eating over it.  You're just like, chips and salsa.  You're flipping pages.  Oops.  You flip a page too fast, it rips.  You're like, oops.  It rips a little.  Ah, shit.  Well, what are you going to do?  Ant also had a Superman number one in his hands.  Wow.  What is that? 
[02:20:00]  Let me guess on that one.  Now, what kind of condition?  That was a little bit better, Jimmy.  Like a six?  Uh, yeah, probably more like a five-five, maybe a six.  Can I guess $60,000?  Uh, yes, but you'd be wrong.  It was only $43,000.  Yes, $43,000.  Oh, that damn more expensive, huh?  $43,000.  Well, it was obviously going to be about the same price if it's the first time Superman appeared  at the first time.  No, sir, it's the first issue of Superman in his own magazine.  Superman originally appeared in Action Comics. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, yes.  That would have been even more expensive.  How much is that one?  It would depend on condition, Jimmy, and I would say your guess is $60,000 would probably go  for one that was about a three or a four.  Now, Kev, what's the most valuable thing you own?  The most valuable thing I own?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  What do you mean you don't know?  I don't know.  How about give us one?  One thing that, you know, if there was a fire, you'd run in and make sure you grab it.  If there was a fire, I'd burn up in the house. 
[02:21:00]  Whatever was burning on the stove?  Get it?  What?  It said if there was a fire in my house, I'd probably die trying to put it out.  Oh, all right.  Oh.  I have a lot of original art, Opie.  Yeah.  And that is, to me, that is what is the most expensive.  Now, the R2-D2 that was there was amazing.  Yeah, the little kid on it.  The little kid on it dressed as a little Jedi.  Yeah.  And he was riding it.  Tiny little dork.  It was a real size, you know. 
[02:21:30]  It was like it was from the movie.  It was better than the prop they used in the movie.  It did everything.  It was better than all of them they used for the movies, yeah.  Quite amazing.  All radio controlled.  Were you impressed by anything there over the weekend?  I was impressed by that.  Yeah?  I was impressed by that.  I was impressed by the fact that William Shatner was gone in less than an hour.  And I saw him on Sunday.  Oh, did you?  Yes.  Was he miserable?  He was there for slightly less than an hour on Sunday.  Was he totally miserable with his $80 pictures? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, it was.  There wasn't a lot of people online, which is very surprising.  Really?  Well, at $80 a clip.  Uh-huh.  He's not the most expensive, and you'd think he would be.  Who would be?  Mark Hamill.  Really?  At $150 a pop, last I heard.  Wow.  That's stupid.  I know.  People pay it.  Who cares he's Luke Skywalker?  Captain fucking Kirk.  Do you get a picture with that, too, or is that extra?  No, you get a picture with that.  Oh, okay.  All right, Kev, we've got to get to these interviews.  Okay, I have one more question for Kev.  What's the most expensive comic, Kev? 
[02:22:30]  Is it action number one?  I would say, on a guess, I would say probably, yeah.  And how much is a mint condition of that?  I have never, I don't think one, I don't think there's a known mint copy of that book  in existence.  Somewhere.  What's the most expensive copy, about $90?  Somewhere.  In one of these apartments with a dead person.  Jimmy, I've heard of one as high as a seven, seven and a half, and it went for, I can't,  I know it was over $100,000, but I don't remember how much.  Oh, okay, wow.  For a goddamn comic book.  I think I got one of those in my attic.  It's insane. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, I'll go find it.  I'll give it to you guys.  What the hell?  Oh, cool.  All right, well, enjoy the, I was by Sam when he did some of those interviews.  They're very funny.  Oh, good.  Thank you, Big Kev.  Thanks, Big Kev.  Take care, guys.  Good talking to you.  It's been a while.  Bye.  All right, there goes Big Kev.  Yeah, so Big Kev there at the comic, the Big Apple comic convention, whatever you want  to call it.  Everyone knows that idiot at those places.  Oh, my God.  I was walking around there like, I couldn't believe it.  My apartment was infested with those things.  They're called silverfish. 
[02:23:30]  Silverfish.  Yeah, I've had them, too.  Silverfish.  Oh.  Ugh, they're fucking good eating, though.  Yeah?  Yeah.  My cat likes them.  Silverfish.  That does really suck.  When I lived with Florentine in Jersey, it would rain, and they would come up from the  basement, and we lived on the second floor, and I'd have three or four of those on my  bedroom wall at a time.  What, were you on Paper Street?  Come on.  No?  Who's that?  Oh, you didn't see Fight Club?  I did see it.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Oh, yeah, he was beating himself up.  And the basement was flooded, you know. 
[02:24:00]  You didn't like Fight Club?  I liked it.  I loved it.  I didn't love it.  Book's better.  No, the movie's great.  Book's better.  The movie's great.  Book's better.  The movie's great infinity.  Book's better.  The movie's great infinity.  Book's better.  I said infinity.  Don't fight.  Plus one.  Book's better.  Fuck.  Guys, don't fight.  What's the haps at the Big Apple Comic Con?  Yeah.  Where E-Rock did not help you at all because he was looking at all the toys.  No, Jess was a huge help, and then E-Rock came and slowed the process down entirely.  E-Rock's just a big, sweet kid.  He is.  He's going to pinch his cheek.  He's like a retard at those places. 
[02:24:30]  He looks at shiny things.  He was very, I forgot to tell you, he was very upset that he found the Transformers toy  that he had been searching for in the box.  It was shiny and came with, I think, two cassette tapes.  Wow.  Four cassette tapes, but it cost $100, and little E-Rock had ran out of pocket money by the time  we got there.  E-Rock.  He ran out of pocket money.  Pocket money.  How can E-Rock?  He ran out of pocket money because he got pictures with too many of his favorite celebrities. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, does that make me happy?  Who did he get pictures with?  That makes me so happy.  I got photos with the Duke boys.  Tom Boat and Josh Snyder.  He started Duke.  We're there.  But they wouldn't let you take them together.  Of course not.  Why?  Well, you got to pay for each one separately.  You had to go to a certain time and pay a certain company to get the combo pick.  They could go fuck themselves.  If you went straight to their booth, you couldn't.  How much was the combo pick?  Enough already.  Yes, Samuel.  It was like $85 just to get both of them in a photo together. 
[02:25:30]  And you don't get to take the photo.  They just print it out, and you don't get a digital copy or anything.  Combo people are the worst.  It is the biggest ripoff on the face of the earth.  Why?  I went to Monster Mania a few years back when they were doing the big...  I can't believe you guys didn't talk about this on the show,  because they did the big They Live reunion.  Oh, wow.  You're kidding me.  Rowdy Roddy?  Yeah.  And fucking...  The black guy.  The black guy from Platoon?  Well, anyway.  So you buy your 8x10, let's say with Roddy Piper first.  So it's $20 for the 8x10, $20 for the autograph. 
[02:26:00]  So now you bring that 8x10 over to Black Guy from They Live.  Now you figure, all right, well, he's just going to charge me $20 for the autograph.  No, he charges you another $20 because you brought your own item for him to sign.  Yeah, they do that, too.  Oh, fuck yourselves.  And they also, like, if you do a combo picture with two people...  Enough already.  You've got to pay.  It's one picture.  I understand.  But you still have to pay for two.  Dude, I understand to a point, like, these guys want to make a little money,  and they're not doing that well, but that's just fucking ripping off your own fans.  It used to be... 
[02:26:30]  It's disgusting.  It used to be, look, you appreciated an actor or a sports star, whatever the fuck he is,  for his work.  You were a fan of his work.  And in exchange for that loyalty, he or she would give you an autograph or a picture.  Right.  It was a little trade-off for your loyalty and fandom, and it's turned into this thing  where now they charge outlandish prices for these fucking autographs that you're not going  to be able to sell for more money. 
[02:27:00]  Sorry.  It just ain't going to happen.  You got to just...  It's like you got to go to a place where it's like you get ripped off.  I mean, there's got to be, like, better companies that have, like, celebrities come in.  Can't think of one.  And get the picture taken.  I can't think of a company.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't really know.  Where you get the best celebrities.  I don't know.  Oh, really?  I wonder who would have that.  Would it be an emporium?  I don't know.  You know, it's funny you should ask that.  Really?  I wonder. 
[02:27:30]  Yes.  What kind of emporium?  Ted's Famous People Photograph Emporium.  Oh.  You name them, I can get them.  Yeah, Ted?  Yes.  Like who?  Who do you want?  All right.  I have Trevor Burbick.  Trevor Burbick.  Trevor Burbick.  Wow.  What about Babe Ruth?  That's a biggie.  He's dead, Gregory.  It's only living people who will come in and you can take photographs with him.  All right.  Let's say I want...  Combinations.  Whatever you need.  I want an A-list star. 
[02:28:00]  I want Tom Cruise.  He's not available.  Why is he available?  He's busy shooting a movie.  Well, but that's just it.  You being the company, you're supposed to find out when...  No, we don't.  But from Jerry Maguire, we have the lady who played one of the secretaries of the opening  scene.  When he's walking through saying hello, she was hello number four.  That isn't even off track of what these fucking conventions are, by the way.  Helen Crumplimpkin. 
[02:28:30]  Helen Crumplimpkin.  Dude, that's exactly what these things are.  I know.  You're not even going to...  90% of the people there are like, you know, person number eight.  All right.  Yeah.  She'll wave at a picture of Tom Cruise like she did in the movie.  That picture is $722.  Shipping costs.  Who are some of the celebrities that had no line?  Well, Brandy Roderick.  Brandy Roderick.  I think that's her name from Celebrity Apprentice.  She was the hot blonde, right?  From Playboy? 
[02:29:00]  No one was online to get her autograph?  I was there for like four hours back and forth and I never saw her.  Oh my God.  How embarrassing.  Mickey Dolenz had a surprisingly short line because he's usually...  Mickey Dolenz, there was no one there.  Most of his fans are dead by now.  He had a whole fucking bunch of like monkeys, drum heads up there that were signed and drum  sticks and fucking...  The problem with Mickey Dolenz and a lot of those guys fall into this problem.  He used to have a long line, but he's at every convention on the East Coast.  So no one gives a flying fuck.  Everybody's already got Mickey Dolenz.  They got it.  They have already.  Yeah. 
[02:29:30]  Don't need it.  Who else?  Virgil.  No line.  Virgil again.  Virgil was there again?  He's a wrestling superstar.  Is this the latest Virgil?  Yes.  Million Dollar Man, Ted DiBiase, and Virgil.  Well, no.  Ted DiBiase did not show up.  Yeah.  They advertised he was coming, but he was never booked to be there.  And he's got one banner that just says...  Yes.  If it sounds like E-Rock's pissed off, it's because he had his Million Dollar Championship  belt ready to get signed by Ted DiBiase.  Oh, the Million Dollar Man signing the Million Dollar Belt. 
[02:30:00]  Jesus Christ, did you get robbed?  I didn't bring it there.  He wasn't going to be there.  He was going to bring it there.  I was going to.  He had it in the office.  I didn't know Black Earl was Virgil.  No, that's Virgil.  It's a different guy.  Oh, I know.  Look at him all alone again.  No.  I love empty line pictures.  All alone again.  It's the only one E-Rock took.  You know who else had nobody in front of him?  Who?  Fucking the kid from Terminator there.  Eddie Furlong?  Yeah.  He had that long line, though.  Did he?  Yeah.  You mean the kid from Pest Cemetery 2?  That's right. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, that kid.  He had a bit of a drop off, didn't he?  When I walked by, there was no one online.  Really?  Yeah, you sure it wasn't for Linda Hamilton?  She was right next to him.  I thought the line was for both of them.  I don't know.  Maybe a double?  You're saying a double?  Maybe a combo type deal.  No combo shot.  Stop it.  I just want to jump in here.  Dave from Hate Speech Radio.  Just as an example of people who care about their fans, Brie Olsen signed an autograph for me for $5,  and I got to feel her tits.  Wow.  There you go.  She's a good girl. 
[02:31:00]  Eric started flipping the hell out because we passed some Battlestar Galactica cast members.  No way.  Previous or new?  The new ones.  Oh, okay.  There were two.  Because I saw.  Yeah, there were Boomer from the old series.  Boomer.  Never saw the old series.  Yeah, from the old Battlestar Galactica.  And what's her name there?  Was also there from Buck Rogers.  And the guy from Buck Rogers.  Aaron Green.  Yeah.  Who's the guy that played Buck Rogers in Buck Rogers? 
[02:31:30]  I don't know his name, but he's there.  John Wayne?  No.  Hold on.  It'll probably pop up here.  Gil Gerard.  Thank you.  Oh, Gil Gerard.  Thank you.  Gil Gerard was sitting there.  No line.  Yep.  Looking like Gil Gerard's great-grandfather.  And he was shoving food in his mouth out of this little styrofoam thing.  You don't want to see these guys like that.  And I looked just going like, oh.  Oh, oh.  Is that him sweating?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's Gil Gerard.  That's Buck Rogers. 
[02:32:00]  Where are these pictures?  They're all over Dan.  I mean, there's one.  The one Virgil picture is on E-Rock's Twitter.  But other than that, it's just a Google image.  Yeah, this was just Google image, yeah.  All right.  Just Google it.  Yeah, Tom Wopat, when I went, had no lines.  He was just surfing on his laptop.  How embarrassing.  That's humiliating.  Because the line was all next to John Snyder.  It's very...  Yeah, John Snyder.  Because John Snyder's got, like, fucking Smallville people and shit like that.  And then what does Tom Wopat have?  Oh, I did the revival of fucking some shitty show on Broadway. 
[02:32:30]  He's got a lot of things going on.  He's in a jazz trio now.  Don't stop it, Sam.  Ernie Hudson didn't have any line when I passed him.  Well, I saw him going to the concession stand with his, who you're going to call.  And on the back, it said Ghostbusters.  Oh, I was wondering.  And then when he got behind the counter, he would put back on his jumpsuit and smile and shuck and jive a little bit.  You know what I'd like to do to Ernie Hudson?  I'd like to just drop honey jars in front of his feet.  And have him throw bees on me.  I'm going to hurt you, Red. 
[02:33:00]  The Batmobile and the, what's it called, the DeLorean, both had longer lines than any of the people we've mentioned.  And I was upset with the DeLorean, because you don't fucking pimp out the DeLorean by putting television screens in the grill.  In the license plates.  In the fucking license plates and in the doors like that.  Just stop it.  The flux capacitor looked good.  It was fluxing.  The equipment looked good on it.  But why would they ruin it by putting television screens?  Eric also, he turned to me while we were walking at one point. 
[02:33:30]  He turned around and said, you know, my legs hurt.  Yeah, I'm hungry.  That's shiny.  I want it, but I have no pocket money.  I've run out of pocket money.  But I'd really like my Transformers toy.  How do you run out of pocket money?  I love its pocket money.  He's run out of pocket money.  No.  Why would you bring more pocket money?  Did he ask to borrow six pence?  He brought a lot of pocket money, but so many of his favorite stars and so many goodies were there.  He didn't know how to ration it properly. 
[02:34:00]  He didn't have any control.  Spending willy-nilly.  Instead of trying to figure it out.  I couldn't spend three bucks there if I was told to.  I could go through a lot of money.  If I was told to, I couldn't spend three dollars there.  I spent $20.  Why?  I took a photo with Bruno Sammartino.  Bruno was there?  Yes.  I would like to see Bruno.  Now you got me a little bit.  Yes.  He's old school.  He hates Vince McMahon and everybody, doesn't he?  He hates him.  He won't even get into it.  He won't accept a nomination into the WWE Hall of Fame. 
[02:34:30]  Why does he hate him?  He doesn't like Vince McMahon.  He doesn't.  I don't know.  They left on terrible terms.  I'm starting to think his own son doesn't like Vince McMahon.  David.  I doubt he does.  No.  Shane quit.  Oh, Shane.  What's that about?  He retired.  Shane McMahon resigned from the WWE.  Really?  He's younger than us.  What is he doing retiring?  He said being 40 years old, he has decided that he wants to pursue other things.  He's thanked everybody.  He's had a great time.  He said it's time now to move on. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, really?  Time to give up the million dollar job he had?  Maybe he's going to help us out.  I think he's had it with dear old dad.  He's probably sick of just doing that.  His whole life has been about men in tights.  Hey, is the rankler going to beat up on the toadstooler?  Hey, how about the jogger who hits the hat mongler with the chair?  Shut up!  That's all necessary.  His whole fucking life has been that nonsense.  I don't know if that's all.  Yeah, but he's in line to take over this billion dollar company. 
[02:35:30]  That's true.  He's 40 years old and his father's like, get in there and take some bumps.  I mean, he probably left at the right time because it looks more like Triple H and Stephanie  will be taking over the reins of that.  He got forced out.  I think he got pushed out.  I was smart!  I'm smart!  He's sitting in the chair.  Got passed over.  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  Dude, actually, who's that old wrestler?  Old bumpy tits McGillicuddy? 
[02:36:00]  I should have pointed it out.  I love that wrestler.  Bumpy tits McGillicuddy.  Hey, Eric.  Can we get some interviews done or what?  Yeah, I was just going to say that Eric, the final Eric story is that he turned around  to me and he said, man, you know, I've never seen them, but after everything that's going  on here, I might have to start getting into these Twilight movies.  That's so funny.  Yes, you did.  You said you were going to get into the Twilight movies.  That's not what I said.  Oh, no.  The one that the chicks are all into. 
[02:36:30]  I started screaming at him and asking if he was a 17-year-old woman.  He was a little girl.  No.  See, what it was is there were so many people dressed up like that.  I asked you, I'm like, should I watch these movies?  And then you said, what are you, a 17-year-old girl?  You said, I think I'm going to start getting into these Twilight movies.  Yeah.  That's what you said.  You want to watch Twilight?  Oh, sweet.  You know what the steampunks are?  Steampunk wear?  Mm-mm.  Oh, okay.  What is it?  I don't know.  It's some fucking, like, Victorian wear that these, like, suicide girl-looking chicks 
[02:37:00]  will wear.  Like, Victorian dress wear and stuff.  But then with, like, gadgetry.  Oh.  Like, fucking, like, oldie-style, new-style stuff.  Like, futuristic from the past stuff.  You should get into that, Eric.  Yeah, Eric, you should do that.  Can you dress up as one of the characters from Twilight?  And they wear, like, top hats.  They wear, like, top hats.  They dress like Van Helsing.  Yeah.  And have, like, gadgetry. 
[02:37:30]  Ooh.  That's a little weird.  Would you wear a top hat?  No, it's a lot fucking weird.  See?  Look at that.  See?  There's a steam thing on the side of your head with things.  I found all that out yesterday, by the way.  That's a bit strange.  Yeah.  All right, let's get to a couple of these interviews.  They're sitting here.  We kept saying they're really good, too.  He didn't ration his money properly.  He didn't ration his pocket money properly.  His pocket money.  It's the worst of 2009.  It's the worst of the year 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony Show with Sam and E-Rock.  We talked about what I was doing there, and now we're talking to people who dress up in costumes. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, the grand finale is just me going around and interviewing some of these weirdos and dorks at Comic-Con.  I should have interviewed you in this segment.  I wasn't dressed up as anything.  But you were a weirdo slash dork.  What is wrong with you?  You collect toys as well.  Yeah, but I don't make a scene about it.  I didn't make a scene either.  I left you alone.  Yeah, exactly.  I do work.  I stepped away from what you were doing so I could go do my thing.  I know, as opposed to actually helping and doing something for the show. 
[02:38:30]  So that wasn't making a scene.  You were doing it in public.  You were there to work.  Plus, you were just at Comic-Con the day before doing your own stuff.  Oh, Sam.  Making up stories.  Let's check out Sam's interviews with some people who dressed up as superheroes at Big  Apple Comic-Con here.  Nerd.  On the Worst of 2009 Countdown.  It's the Worst of 2009.  Sam.  Yeah?  We go back to what's the haps at the Big Apple Comic-Con.  Yeah.  Yesterday you talked to big stars like Anthony Cumia.  Oh, yeah.  The Iron Sheik. 
[02:39:00]  Nikolai Volkov.  And?  Tom Wopat.  Okay.  See, I remember.  Okay.  And today we continue with the second half of your interviews, and you said that these  interviews were way better than the ones we played yesterday.  Yeah, because I got to meet some superheroes.  No, Anthony.  It's through no fault of yours.  That's okay.  You caught me.  You know, I was fascinated.  You were off.  You know, you were doing...  I was fascinated.  I was going to talk to you.  I was going to say what I was about to say.  Oh.  Someone was walking.  Somebody was walking funny down the hall. 
[02:39:30]  Oh.  And I was speculating.  You were going to speculate as to why?  That someone might have had a rough night last night.  Oh, look.  She's tugging on her pants.  She is so tugging.  Did you see her tugging on the jeans?  What's going on there?  Oopsie.  Our show is being played down the hall because she just looked back at us.  All right.  Hey, Sam meets Iceman.  Yeah, I meant the Iceman.  Who the fuck is the Iceman?  You know, from the X-Men.  Oh, I thought you meant...  Oh.  I thought from Top Gun.  I thought Top Gun, too.  No.  I thought he came up to you and took his teeth and went... 
[02:40:00]  Snack them together at you.  He told me he was dangerous?  You're dangerous, Sam.  No.  I meant superheroes.  There's a superhero named the Iceman?  Yeah.  Who does he fight?  I don't know, but he hangs out with the X-Men.  Fire guy.  He's a Marvel superhero.  The Human Torch.  He fights Fire guy.  Yeah.  No, I don't think that's the case.  Iceman and fight...  What?  It's not the guy that makes the fucking...  Made the ice rink?  Like, so him and the little fucking chick that goes through walls could skate? 
[02:40:30]  That's him right there.  Turn to your right.  The Iceman, who's covered in blue paint at Comic-Con.  Yeah, and he was there with his X-Men friends.  Yeah.  Fake X-Men friends.  Oh, yeah.  And most of the costumes were horrendous.  Costumes.  Costumes.  That's correct.  Costumes.  All right, we're here at Big Apple Comic-Con with us.  Some guy dressed him...  Iceman.  Iceman.  Iceman of the X-Men.  Bobby Drake, I'm here with my X-Men friends of the X-Gym.  So these are your friends? 
[02:41:00]  Indeed, they are.  Yeah.  My best friends.  Iceman.  I've never seen Iceman's nipples so extended.  Yes, they're very erect because I'm actually quite cold, and I didn't wear a jacket on my  way here, and it is mid-October.  Now, here's what confuses me.  You're obviously in great shape, Iceman.  Thank you.  You seem like a handsome guy, a very good jawbone.  I appreciate it, brother.  Don't you think if you got rid of all this paint and stuff, you could actually get some  girls?  I do have a girl, and her name is She-Hulk.  She-Hulk is your girl? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, yes, and she's quite a wild one, I'll tell you.  There's she.  What's wrong, O?  You're making a face.  Is she really?  She's a wild one.  She-Hulk.  She-Hulk.  It's just that his girlfriend has a retard haircut, and she's deaf.  Holy shit.  Quite a wild one, I'll tell you.  She's got a penis, correct?  She does not have a penis.  She-Hulk is, in fact, a woman.  The regular Hulk has a penis, but She-Hulk has all the parts that a woman should have. 
[02:42:00]  How on earth do you keep from melting?  I absorb the moisture in the air, and I convert it into, I lower the climate, the temperatures.  I control the area, you know?  But look, my friend works out so hard, you can't hurt it.  Your friend is wrapped in duct tape.  No, that's steel.  That's organic steel.  Is that true?  Indeed.  No, it's not true, but yes, it is true.  Okay, cool.  What?  Iceman and the rest of your ex-friends.  Indeed.  I hope you have a great time, and that you keep from melting. 
[02:42:30]  Thank you, my friend.  I'll try my best.  Thank you.  So, going back to yesterday, so people line up to get their pictures taken with these  guys, too?  Yeah, well, yeah, these guys.  Why?  These guys just walk around.  Yeah, I saw the Hulk.  And then people come up, and they got to take their picture with the ex-friends.  And, like, the one guy dressed as Colossus, who's supposed to be made of, like, metal.  And what was he made of?  Tin furl?  Duct tape.  Yeah, duct tape.  He just wrapped duct tape around a sweatshirt.  That's wonderful.  Does it look real? 
[02:43:00]  No, that's why I said it.  That's just duct tape.  Hey, here's a guy, Dave in Houston, had to do this at these events.  Dave.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Dave.  Throwing myself under the bus here, but, yes, I do travel around the country going to different  shows like this.  I dress as Conan the Barbarian.  Why?  Why, sir?  Why?  It's actually a lot of fun.  For who?  What's fun about it? 
[02:43:30]  You know, if you don't do it, I can't explain it.  It's just...  Yes, you can.  We both have the common bond of language.  I don't understand what would be fun about getting a tranny, either.  Well, I can tell you, shit.  Oh, shit.  You got you there.  Those are fighting words.  It's receiving the blowjob, probably.  Well, you know, if I were a single band, I could probably do the same, just as Conan  the Barbarian, so it is a lot of fun. 
[02:44:00]  I've actually been in your studios when I was up there for New York Comic Con a couple  of years ago.  Sounds like a threat.  And?  No, really, and?  Like, you were in our studios.  Did you do anything?  No, you talked to me a bit.  I was...  Yeah, you won't remember, but I made a comment about looking for Shane's in a pickup truck.  And I got a nice phone with Jimmy, and I'm getting the silent treatment, aren't I?  No. 
[02:44:30]  I could use that call on my threat assessments.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That guy seemed unstable.  Lucky you.  Sam meets David Bowie from Labyrinth and talks about his bulge.  Wow.  David Bowie was there?  How did I miss David Bowie?  I would think that would be a giant.  No, no, no.  David Bowie from Labyrinth.  Yeah, yeah, well, that's what I mean.  It's like, you'd think there'd be a giant crowd around David Bowie.  Wow, David Bowie's career has dropped down a bit, that he's hanging out at these Comic-Cons 
[02:45:00]  as Labyrinth.  What happened?  The Goblin King.  Was it actually David Bowie?  No, it was the Goblin King.  Oh, oh, so it was a guy, another geeky douchebag, dressed up as the character that David Bowie  was paid very well to play.  That's correct, Nathan.  And this guy's getting $7 an hour.  No.  You guys are confused.  I acted with Jennifer Connelly when she was real hot.  That is correct.  These guys are not paid to dress up as superheroes and walk around. 
[02:45:30]  These are people who pay admission, dress up as a superhero, and walk around.  Oh.  They're not hired by the convention.  No?  So they're just doing this for free?  For fun.  They think this is, I mean, for fun?  Yeah.  Excuse me.  They're not doing it for free.  They're paying to get in.  Danny's finding some really bad Labyrinth costume.  Oh, God damn.  Look at that.  Look at this guy.  Nice head.  That wasn't him.  He did a better job with the makeup.  All right.  Well, let's see what you got out of this guy. 
[02:46:00]  This is zero.  All right.  We're here with David Bowie from Labyrinth.  David Bowie, what's the haps?  Oh, this is quite some time here.  He's doing the voice.  Is he trying to do the accent?  Oh, my God.  He didn't have a crystal.  He should have had a crystal.  He should have had it.  Quite some time here.  Now, what do you hope to accomplish here at Comic Con or Big Apple Con?  Well, right now I'm just out getting as many pictures as I can.  I'm with my friends.  They're buying a mass load of comic books. 
[02:46:30]  So, I see the bulge here.  Did you work on this specifically because of David's bulge in the film?  Of course.  See, actually, in my costume paper, they said, no, any specifics, and I put down the bulge.  What costume paper?  There's a big costume contest going on that Wizard's throwing, I guess.  So, do you think when you look back at some of your celebrity pictures and realize that you're dressed as David Bowie from Labyrinth, you'll feel a fool?  No.  I'll feel all that much better.  I think that's true. 
[02:47:00]  So, now, what did you accomplish to pull off this bulge?  Really, I just wrapped a sock around it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you worried about any excitement down there or like a semi-erection making it so that your costume is not as accurate?  Well, semi-erection, that would be a problem.  But I'm trying to keep myself calm today, you know?  Well, with all the comic books here, I would assume that you've already achieved the erection, possibly.  No, no, not quite.  I've been staying away from that area. 
[02:47:30]  Good for you.  Smart thinking.  Yeah.  He is a waste of fucking life.  You don't like any of these guys?  No.  That was an exhausting minute and 18 seconds.  That's all it was?  Yeah.  Shit, I was ready to grab my bag and leave.  And what gives nerds erections?  Comic books.  Comic books and shit.  Having socks wrapped around their dicks, too.  I'm sure he loved that.  Yeah.  Toys.  E-Rock got a big boner from that Transformer toy.  He sure did.  I can't wait for his girl to leave him. 
[02:48:00]  That was going to be a fun day for all of us.  He didn't have enough pocket money for the good toy.  I hope he's saving his pocket money for that day.  Is that Mossman?  When she goes so long.  He spent his last bit of pocket money on Mossman and couldn't afford his Transformer toy.  What's Mossman?  Is that real Moss?  I don't think so.  Why don't we continue?  Sam meets the Joker.  This should be good.  Yes, the Joker.  Jack Nicholson was there?  No, no, no, no.  Because he's Ledger's dead, so I would assume.  They would go right to Jack Nicholson, so that's pretty cool. 
[02:48:30]  No, the Joker.  Oh, God.  You're naming actors.  I meant the Joker.  The Joker.  From the Dark Knight.  Who causes problems for Batman.  He was there.  He was there.  The Joker.  All right.  How many more of these do we have?  I can't even fake this today.  We're at the big apple con with the Joker.  The Joker, what's the haps?  Well, I met Adam West, and Batman over there is looking quite retro. 
[02:49:00]  I can't listen to this.  Why?  I met Adam West over there, looking quite retro.  You can tell it's the real Joker, by the way, his voice is.  Oh, yeah.  Which Joker is he doing?  From the Dark Knight.  The Joker.  He's doing Heath Ledger's version?  Heath Ledger Joker.  Heath Ledger was probably playing him as this is the Joker.  There were a lot of Riddlers walking around, I noticed.  There were some Riddlers.  A lot of Riddlers walking around.  Oh, Jesus.  That looks great.  What?  That guy.  He just didn't even try. 
[02:49:30]  I love the guy.  Stop it.  No, that wasn't.  That looks like a fake Joker to me.  I spoke to a man who introduced himself as the Joker.  Quite retro.  And I had a run-in with Gordon.  With Gordon?  Yeah.  Commissioner Gordon?  Yeah.  And what happened?  Did he arrest you?  Oh, no.  Since you're the Joker.  He held me at gunpoint, but...  Well, let's just say he's on the ground.  He died happy. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, did you kill him?  Since you're the...  What a fucking...  This guy is giving me such douche chills.  What a fucking zilch.  Tim, you don't like his improv?  It's fucking horrendous.  Why couldn't he have been found in a hotel room dead?  He makes Bobo look like Jonathan Winters.  What a fool this guy is.  Look at this guy.  Looks like Screech dressed up as fucking the Joker.  No, he's fucking Bruno from the original Fame. 
[02:50:30]  The caption says, Seth Rogen Joker.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good...  Anyone with tight, curly hair.  That guy was fucking terrible at his improv.  Awful.  Danny, a few pees on the...  He died happy.  Yes, he had a gun.  Commissioner Gordon.  Stumbling over himself.  A few people say in the Iceman that Sam interviewed, there's a big YouTube video where he's rapping at Comic-Con.  No.  Wow.  So you might have been talking to a...  Wow.  No, he's not.  Oh, did you kill him? 
[02:51:00]  Since you're the Joker?  Yeah, of course not.  Did you meet Catwoman?  He has nothing.  Yeah, of course.  What are you, an idiot?  He has nothing.  He has nothing.  I'm telling him a voice he has.  I gotta hear that again.  Oh, is this guy fucking...  It's a pretty easy question.  Did you kill him?  And he goes, yeah, of course.  Of course.  And just runs out of air.  Oh, did you kill him?  Since you're the Joker?  Yeah, of course not.  Of course not.  That's a...  Of course. 
[02:51:30]  This guy is fucking abominable.  Oh, shit, I didn't think I was going to be asked that question.  Basic fucking Joker questions he can't answer.  Did you kill Commissioner Gordon?  Right, that would be something you should figure out in your head, because you might be asked that if you're walking around as the Joker.  Did you kill him?  Since you're the Joker?  Yeah, of course not.  Did you meet Catwoman?  Not yet.  Is she here?  Well, the actress who plays her is over there.  Not the real Catwoman.  No, no.  I saw Batgirl over there earlier today. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Do you have a grudge with her, too?  Anyone associated with Batman is at fault.  Oh, I see.  Now, Joker, I am surprised to see you here, because I thought you died of an overdose of pain pills and alcohol.  No, that was Heath Ledger.  That wasn't the Joker?  No.  But I am paying tribute to Heath Ledger.  Oh, okay.  Like, in all seriousness, he was a great actor, and I would have loved to have met him.  He dropped character.  Maybe at a convention just like this. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, Joker.  Thanks a lot, Joker.  He dropped character, because he was very offended that I brought up Heath Ledger.  He would have loved to meet Heath Ledger.  Guess what?  It's not the same for Heath Ledger.  Hopefully he will soon.  Of course I can't.  Yeah, that's him.  That's the Ice Man.  What, you found the YouTube rap video?  That's my team, the X-Men. 
[02:53:00]  Have a success with this now.  This isn't the one of him rapping.  I think I have that, though.  He's well-built.  He is.  He's in very good shape.  Good for him.  Also a boob.  Oh, Joker sounds like Napoleon Dynamite.  Very good, Ronnie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I interviewed that guy, too.  I'm the Joker.  Listen on the stage.  Drummer like a rage.  I am the man, and I'm gonna entertain. 
[02:53:30]  Okay.  I stand by.  Sound.  Turn off my mic, but I can go all night.  Okay, let's see.  Can we do it right?  Give me a topic.  And slid.  He'll make you drop it.  What is it?  Anything.  Say something.  Improving.  Giraffe?  Okay.  Listen, listen.  Okay.  Giraffe.  It's just like a plant.  A long neck.  Please let me correct.  You would see giraffes up eaten in the trees and a freestyle about them so easily. 
[02:54:00]  Giraffes, you know they have the funny pattern.  Giraffes are tall like the planet Saturn.  Oh, look at me.  We are just dancing.  Look at my skin.  I'm so handsome.  Boom.  And we're the X-Men.  Those are my friends that we will not...  Ah!  Ah!  What are you doing, Gregory?  Those guys were wonderful.  Ah!  Ah!  You like that, Ted?  I certainly do.  I had topics I wanted to throw out.  Oh.  Peanut chew!  At my breakfast, I wanted to throw out.  That is horrible. 
[02:54:30]  Well, we got Larry King checking in, Anthony.  Always a pleasure when Larry calls the show.  Larry!  I had topics!  How important is learning your character?  Yeah, it's very important.  You might be asked some important questions at Comic-Con.  Gregory, what topics would you have yelled out at the rappers?  How about you, Samuel?  Uh, colostomy bags.  Yay! 
[02:55:00]  How about...  Go.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Well, they steal.  They jump and they run real fast.  I don't know you can rap there, Ted.  I certainly can.  I'm very good.  Rapping Ted Sheckler.  Yes!  Or just Bond, Anthony.  Y'all thing is, don't know what I'm dealing with.  Up in this motherfucker.  As it turned out, a lot of Ice... 
[02:55:30]  Like, four of Iceman's ex-friends are huge ONA fans.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they told him who I was after I interviewed him.  I am.  Good for them.  Yeah.  Like, can we stop the interviews before we get to the Ghostbuster guy?  Do you want to?  You actually met a Ghostbuster guy?  I met a Ghostbuster.  Is it the guy that played a Ghostbuster in the movie, or someone just dressing up as a Ghostbuster?  Oh, don't cross the streams. 
[02:56:00]  They all just sound like him.  Wow.  I'm Superman.  He had a Ghostbuster outfit.  He had a Ghostbuster backpack and a Ghostbuster zapper.  Yeah.  I've never seen him in any films, so I would say he's a Ghostbuster.  An actual Ghostbuster.  Oh, wow.  Before we get there, we got one more on the Joker, I think.  Tim in South Carolina.  Tim.  The way that Joker answers follow-up questions, you'd think it's Bob Kelly. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, Bob Kelly is the Joker would be pretty funny.  You know what, dude?  I got these scars.  Boom.  Where's the Batman?  Hey, Joker, did he kill Commissioner Gordon?  Who are you asking?  Who are you asking?  Jerry doesn't know who he is.  Did he ask you Bob or Ted the Joker?  I didn't kill Commissioner Gordon.  He's sleeping on a banana peel. 
[02:57:00]  His teeth.  Who left that banana peel, though?  No, see.  See, I was in the imaginary world, Bob Kelly as the Joker.  So I was asking the Joker.  I wasn't acknowledging that it was Bob Kelly, per se.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so then I said Joker, or did you kill Commissioner Gordon?  You know what, dude?  Commissioner Gordon had a lump on his prostate.  Dude, you know what?  Boom, you got your face.  Let's meet a Ghostbuster.  Send me an actual Ghostbuster. 
[02:57:30]  Yes.  All right, we're here at the Big Apple Comic Con with a Ghostbuster.  What's the haps?  Huge anniversary.  Ghostbusters 2 is celebrating its 20th anniversary.  We heard Ernie Hudson was going to be here, so I put on my stuff and we met him and everything.  I got a picture with him wearing my gear.  It's very awesome, very nice.  We met a couple of other Ghostbuster fans and people from Long Island, Queens, around town here.  Is that the first time you've ever worn a Ghostbusters outfit?  No, I've been doing this since 99, 2000.  Where do you wear it? 
[02:58:00]  Hi, I'm around town.  Usually, after work, I go out around Times Square and do this.  People take pictures and whatnot.  Do you charge them?  No, it's such a great thing.  People love it.  It brings joy to kids and families.  Does it?  You see the back there?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  This is a new piece of equipment called the ionization converter.  What does that do?  Well, if you remember from the first movie, after they caught Slimer, Ray was talking,  if the ionization rate was constant for all ectoplasmic entities,  we find out that that's not true. 
[02:58:30]  Unfortunately, I do not remember that.  Well, if you watch the movie, when they get back to the university.  Of course.  We're talking outside the university.  Outside the university.  Uh, he has a lot of helpful information.  Uh, we're talking outside the university.  Chris Russo.  At times, I'm a Ghostbuster.  It's a bad dog as a Ghostbuster.  Well, you can't cross the stream.  There's going to be a problem.  Keep your mind clear.  Don't think about anything.  Uh, something's going to be made. 
[02:59:00]  Oh, no.  We've got to step up Marshmallow Man coming up the street.  There's going to be big problems there.  I don't know how they're going to handle it.  How do you take on the Marshmallow Man as he's coming up the street there?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Mad dog?  Unfortunately, I believe we're going to have to cross the streams.  Yeah, I think so.  Just to make enough energy to fucking, uh...  They take one minute detail from the movie.  Oh, oh.  And blow it out of proportion to the point...  And stink.  No one gives a shit except for maybe two more human beings on this planet.  You don't think that guy was interesting? 
[02:59:30]  Oh, what a dork.  Do you think Ernie Hudson is, like, happy when people like that come up to him and ask  him questions about...  He'd be happier if Michael Richards just yelled his act at him.  Why didn't you talk to Ernie Hudson himself?  He'd turn me down.  Tell him what the fuck.  Who are you to turn me down?  He thinks who the fuck he is.  Yeah.  You should have just forced yourself on him.  Who gives a shit if he got thrown out of the joint?  Well, then I wouldn't have gotten to interview a Ghostbuster.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  You didn't.  What?  You interviewed an asshole with a fucking toaster on his back.  Stop it.  Well, Sam got the next best thing.  Instead of talking to Ernie Hudson, he talks to this fake Ghostbuster about Ernie Hudson.  Yes.  So who's your favorite Ghostbuster?  My favorite Ghostbuster is Dr. Race Dance.  Why is that?  He's the heart of the Ghostbusters.  He's just a thesaurus of knowledge of paranormal activity, and he's a true believer of the paranormal,  just like I am. 
[03:00:30]  You are?  Well, so you believe in the paranormal and ghosts and things, but you want to hunt them down?  Well, not all ghosts are good.  There are such things as help spirits.  And werewolves.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, we're working on this to see if it will work on other supernatural beings.  Do you think that you could make a proton pack that will zap werewolves, vampires, and ghosts?  We're working on it.  That should be the 2010 model.  Who's working on it?  The guys.  Oh, boy.  I love how Sam trips them up because their fucking improv skills are so bad that Sam throws 
[03:01:00]  in these softballs and they just can't hit them.  That's a great question.  Who's working?  The guys.  The guys.  No, see.  It was just a movie.  No one's working on this.  Yeah.  Why would they?  There's no reason to work on this.  Passed by the firehouse that's supposed to be their headquarters.  You know what?  There's no Ghostbusters logo on top of it.  No.  What?  No.  Just fire trucks.  That's it.  Where is it?  Ghosts?  We're working on it.  That should be the 2010 model.  Who's working on it? 
[03:01:30]  The guys.  Peter Venkman?  Venkman and Ernie.  Well, Ernie's here if you've seen him.  Were you disappointed that Ernie Hudson wasn't wearing his Ghostbuster outfit?  He's wearing it now.  He is?  He's wearing his GB2 suit.  The dark gray one?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a picture of him with my gear.  Don't you think it's a little sad that Ernie Hudson hasn't moved on from the silly Ghostbusters?  He's done other things.  He's done Secret Life of an American Teenager.  But he's still wearing that dumb suit.  I mean, Ghostbusters is iconic.  Okay, cool. 
[03:02:00]  Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you, and I hope you continue to bust the ghosts.  We are.  We're ready to believe you.  I don't know what that means.  Life in the movie.  Of course.  I'm done.  Thanks a lot.  The guy was all excited.  He goes, life in the movie.  That's great, though.  I don't know what that means.  A line from the movie.  Oh, good for you.  God.  How about you do a line from the movie we all know?  Yeah.  Sam is just terrible.  I don't know any lines from Ghostbusters except Zap.  I don't know what you mean.  I don't know what that means. 
[03:02:30]  Ghostbusters was a lousy movie.  Stunk.  I watched it recently.  It did stink.  I watched it recently.  I didn't like it.  That young man told me.  It's dated now or something.  I don't know what it was.  That in his opinion, the film Ghostbusters is better than the film Goodfellas.  Do you have a picture of this guy?  Does it need to go?  No.  Did you slap him for that?  I didn't.  Slap him.  Sam meets a guy playing with a lightsaber.  Yeah.  He had his own booth.  There were a lot of lightsabers there.  It looked almost...  But he was in his own booth, which you have to pay for. 
[03:03:00]  And he looked almost like Star Wars Kid, just swinging his lightsaber around.  So I wanted to get to the bottom of that.  How much do you pay for a booth?  A lot.  So it's just some rich kid?  Well, as it turns out...  Getting money from his dad?  I mean, I don't want to do any spoilers, but he's got a club that he's trying to get some members for.  Let's go to this.  Start with North American man, boy.  I had...  Out.  Out.  Did you?  All right, we're at the Big Apple Con with one of the sword fighters. 
[03:03:30]  What's the haps?  I'm part of New York Jedi, a fight choreography group that focuses mainly...  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, you're not.  Let it go.  We just found the worst hobby ever.  I'm part of the Disappoint Your Father group.  It's an average film.  Move on.  I got really...  Fucking assholes.  I got really excited when he told me what group he was doing.  Oh, I bet you did.  Yes, I did.  They have a website and everything.  The New York Jedi.  New York Jedi.  Wow. 
[03:04:00]  They have lightsabers.  All right, we're at the Big Apple Con with one of the sword fighters.  What's the haps?  I'm part of New York Jedi, a fight choreography group that focuses mainly on lightsabers from the Star Wars movies and universe.  Basically, we're a bunch of, you know, geeks.  Some of us are martial artists.  Some of us are dancers.  Some of us have no experience doing either or.  We're just a bunch of people who enjoy doing fights and just enjoy putting together and entertaining the crowd.  Who would win in a plastic sword fight?  A martial artist or a dancer? 
[03:04:30]  A plastic?  A plastic?  You are fucking notorious, man.  That's awesome.  Because you just know the guy doesn't want to call it a plastic sword.  Really?  He wants you to call it a lightsaber.  Calling it a plastic sword makes it seem silly.  Whoops.  See, this is the coolest thing in the world.  Look.  Oh, my God.  They're doing lightsaber fights out in the street.  Because I was looking at him with these very interested eyes. 
[03:05:00]  So he had to know I meant no harm when I said plastic sword fight.  Wow.  These guys are good.  Master Poe should do this.  Ha!  Ha!  Who would win in a plastic sword fight?  A martial artist or a dancer?  Good.  So you think...  Ooh.  I know.  It's a tough one.  I honestly can't say.  It would depend. 
[03:05:30]  It really would depend.  On what?  Are you pissed off about all the heat that the Star Wars kid took on YouTube?  YouTube?  Yeah.  Look.  Look.  I mean, just because we're a, you know, a group that runs around with giant glow sticks,  we do get some graft.  But nobody gets the joke better than we do.  I mean, we insult ourselves better than anyone else can.  You can't make fun of yourselves.  They insult themselves better than anyone else can.  I doubt that's true.  They are so serious. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, wait.  How can I master Poe work a lightsaber?  That was, yeah, somebody actually superimposed the lightsaber on one of his stick fights  that he was having with Craig.  That's Craig, right?  Oh, wow.  That's not a real lightsaber?  No.  Our security guard got into a stick fight with one of our interns.  Yeah.  That's smart.  Correct.  And they used the movie magic to make it a lightsaber.  Oh, that's sweet.  But toy sword fight guy explains how awesome his club is to Sam. 
[03:06:30]  This is the final clip from Comic-Con.  Oh, no.  Thank fucking God.  Come on here.  Until next time.  How good are you at this stuff?  How good am I?  I can't, I'm not going to gauge myself at all.  I've only been here for eight months.  There are some people, the group's only been around for five years.  Some of us have been around for that long.  Some of us only about a year, some three.  Why do people spend time doing this?  Because it's fun.  I mean, seriously, you're holding a, you know, forget the fact that it's Star Wars. 
[03:07:00]  You're holding a sword of pure energy.  Well, it's a toy with a light bulb.  It is.  Yes, it is essentially a flashlight.  It is.  It is.  I mean, but just the idea that you can do anything with.  Well, you can't cut anything.  Well, I mean, physically, like tricks and stuff.  I mean, you could do fencing, you could do broadsword, you could do samurai swords, you  could do, you know.  But you could also technically do that with a pointer for a chalkboard. 
[03:07:30]  Yes.  Yes, you could.  Or a pool cue.  Yes.  Or like a branch that fell off a tree in a storm.  Yes.  Would I be welcome into your group if I tied a bunch of glow sticks to a tree branch and  swung it around like a retard?  I, swinging around like a retard, we wouldn't really like.  One of our first tenets in the group is safety.  We, above all things, we value safety the most.  I mean, we, the first thing we teach is control of the blade. 
[03:08:00]  No word.  Ew.  The blade or the plastic shorts?  Well, for all intents and purposes, the blade.  Or, in this scenario, plastic.  Plastic, yes.  And at the end of the day, everybody goes home happy.  Yes.  To their mom's basements.  Maybe.  It's not for you to judge.  It's not for me to judge.  I can't speculate where most of our members live.  All right.  Well, I appreciate your time, and I hope people join the sword fight club.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  What are you doing?  That's fantastic.  I'm watching the MasterPose demo. 
[03:08:30]  He's just tapping them.  What does this mean?  It's really helpful if you ever get into a fight where the other person was in slow motion.  Or not moving at all.  You can hit him a whole bunch of times.  He could kick your ass in a slap fight.  Oh, Jesus.  That's stunning.  That gentleman did not like you referencing his lightsaber as a plastic toy, even though  he was like, oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I know he did.  The blade.  No. 
[03:09:00]  Their tenant is safety first.  There's no blade.  Safety first, pussy last.  What an ass.  Yeah, you can't buy a blade in KB Toys.  No.  No, but you can buy a flashlight with a colorful stick on it.  Yeah.  His was red, which means he's a bit evil.  Oh, he's a little evil.  Yeah.  I understand.  Great job.  Thank you.  That was ridiculous.  It's the worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:09:30]  I'm E-Rock.  He's Sam.  The year wouldn't be complete without taking a look back at the worst of Ted.  Who is that?  It's Professor Ted Frump.  Ted, Ted, Ted Burns.  Teddy Rash.  Ted Portnork.  Ted's Match Emporium.  Ted's Inflatable Rat Factory.  Ted's Egg Emporium.  You're listening to The Ted Show.  Ted's an ass.  What were these New Yorkers buzzing about this holiday weekend?  Bees.  Thousands of them swarming around a hive in this lower Manhattan building. 
[03:10:00]  When I got here, there was already like a thousand bees in there.  But then they came out.  There were more.  They were like in a pack.  The swarm left employees in this video game store trapped inside for hours.  The insects forced them to close shop while waiting for help.  While officials were trying to figure out how to solve the unusual problem,  a good Samaritan was able to lure about a thousand bees into a bag,  which he then put in a box for safety.  But more bees streamed out of the building. 
[03:10:30]  What were people doing when you approached this?  I don't know.  They were laughing, some of them, you know.  Is anyone stung?  Not yet.  Well, that's a good thing.  Stay away.  Stay away.  Finally, a bee specialist showed up to begin the tough task of removing the bees.  I'm probably going to be relying on scent, on the queen's scent from in here.  I'm going to have her attract them in.  The trick worked.  The store was later reopened.  The bees, meantime, have been taken to hives in upstate New York.  Can I tell you something? 
[03:11:00]  Sure.  The bees.  When did you lose?  The second she opened her mouth.  That voice of hers.  New Yorkers are buzzing.  What happened, for real?  About bees.  I completely, like, completely zoned out.  And then I'm like, I realized I was zoning and I was trying to focus and I just went somewhere else.  You can't.  What happens?  All right, bees in a place, then what happened at the end?  In a GameStop.  And then they called a specialist to get the bees away.  And he used the scent of a queen bee to lure the bees away.  And then the bees went upstate. 
[03:11:30]  The end.  Dude, I started thinking about bacon again.  Bacon.  Bacon honey.  They did call a bee expert.  Yes.  Who are?  Thank you.  At least someone understands why I pulled this stuff.  I wonder what they cost.  It's probably very expensive.  Wait, a bee expert?  Bee expert.  Bee expert.  Yeah.  I wonder if you'll be able to get a discount bee expert.  I don't think there's many bee experts in the university especially.  Nah, probably not.  Just feel free to call TENS Pesky Bee Removal Emporium. 
[03:12:00]  They're pesky?  Yes.  The way to get rid of bees is I walk right under the hive and I flail my arms wildly and  yell, shoo.  I put honey on my fingers.  But Ted, you're going to get stung by bees.  Yes, I have, Gregory.  I was stung 4,000 times once.  4,000 times?  Yes.  Where do they usually stung?  That's how I remove the bees.  I entice them to sting me and they die.  Where do they sting you?  All over my body and genitals. 
[03:12:30]  Why your genitals?  I don't know.  I should probably tuck them in before I do this.  Sometimes I attempt to tinkle on the bees as they're swarming me.  Why would you have your genitals exposed?  Because I'm wee-weeing on the bees, Gregory.  I figure that the liquid will kill them.  Yeah, that's probably a bad thing.  I grab the hornet's nest.  I shake it angrily.  Hornet's nest.  I say, get out of here.  Sometimes I punch it.  Like a speed bag. 
[03:13:00]  They probably come out.  They certainly do.  They're very upset.  One time I was hitting it and I was making a noise.  A dook-a-dook-a-dook-a-dook-a-dook-a.  Wow.  And what do you charge for a bee removal?  I usually charge $3 per bee.  That's a lot of money.  So I remove the stingers and add it up.  And the money comes rolling in.  $3 a bee.  Do you have to go to the hospital every time?  Every single time. 
[03:13:30]  Sounds like you don't mind the bee stingers.  I hate them.  I just scream and yell, help.  Then I have to call a bee expert with smoke.  So why don't you close your business?  Because it makes me riches.  What's it called?  Ted's Pesky Bee Removal Emporium.  I also sell bee removing products.  Like I sell a stick for $400 and you can poke the nest with it.  But anyone can get a stick.  Not like this one they can.  It's shaped like a big bee.  So it lulls them into a sense of security. 
[03:14:00]  They think their God has arrived.  Isn't that what we're hoping for, Ted?  It's the worst of the year 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony Show with Sam and E-Rock.  And we both work for the Opie and Anthony Show.  For now.  For now until they hear this show.  E-Rock, Opie teased it for weeks.  Finally was the Bob Kelly Opie fly fishing trip to Roscoe, New York.  Yes, this is something Opie wasn't really willing to be a part of.  No.  But kind of had his hand forced by Bob Kelly. 
[03:14:30]  And thank God for the honesty and integrity of Opie.  He shared his entire trip with all the listeners.  In fact, he posted a whole bunch of videos.  If you want to, while you're listening to this, if you're at home, check out YouTube.com slash Opie Radio.  And I think Robert Kelly fans on Twitter as well has some.  I think those are just retweets.  Oh, okay.  Just go to the YouTube site, Opie Radio.  Don't pay attention to that other guy.  And listen to the telling of the tale of Opie and Bob Kelly going fly fishing. 
[03:15:00]  It's number 27 on the Worst of 2009 countdown.  It's the Worst of 2009.  Elzner Rufino presents Bob Kelly's Titty Mountain Highway Tour.  Head down the Titty Mountain Highway with Bob Kelly's Titty Mountain Highway Tour.  Featuring the smash hit song, Titty Mountain Highway.  From the platinum selling album, Titty Mountain Highway.  It's Bob Kelly's Titty Mountain Highway Tour. 
[03:15:30]  Rolling down the Titty Mountain Highway to a city near you.  Tickets on sale now.  Are we getting Robert Kelly on the phone?  Hope so.  Hope so.  Talk about matching the hatch.  Now we understand the whole fucking thing.  You got it now.  What am I going to do?  Do a half hour on fucking fly fishing on this show?  I kind of want to hear when Jimmy's talking about taking a dildo up his ass.  How am I supposed to follow that with a fly fishing?  Not a dildo.  My friend is a strap-on.  Strap-on.  I'm sorry.  I don't need the technical things like you training us for that.  But I do kind of want to know where your head was at during the whole thing. 
[03:16:00]  How it started.  Your first cast.  I started.  First cast.  First of all, my fucking fly ended up in the trees behind me.  Did it?  I was breaking flies left and right.  See, this is all inside fly fishing shit.  No one gives a crap about it.  No.  I mean, people.  You know how light your fly is on the end of your line?  You know how hard it is to snap those things off?  But it's because I had the whipping motion.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of the 10 and 2, like Bob Kelly said, 10 and 2.  And stop it.  Oh, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.  You were going, whip, whip, Indiana Jones. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  And then you got to know when to release.  And then you place the fly.  You release when your cock is between the tits.  That's the best time.  And then you let your fly just float slowly down the river  where the trout are kind of taking a peek from down below.  And you hope that they come up and grab it.  What time did you start fishing?  I don't know.  I think we started heading toward the river around 8 in the morning yesterday.  What time did you finish?  Like fucking one.  It was like four hours in the water.  And it was raining.  Did you catch them?  Bobby was smoking the whole fucking time. 
[03:17:00]  Did you catch anything?  I think I might have got a bite.  Did you get a nipple?  But they're kind of telling me that you don't really get bites when you're trout fishing.  Because the hook is ridiculously tiny.  Wait, you fucking spent all those hours and didn't get a bucket of fish?  You caught nothing?  Why are you upset?  That's a waste.  You drove an hour.  You stayed in a bed bug motel.  How about two and a half?  There you go.  To stand in the water with that fucking monstrosity smoking.  Just committing suicide in the water.  I was in a serial killer motel to begin with. 
[03:17:30]  With fucking the bed bugs.  Because I saw the droppings.  And the fucking pillow that smelled like old man breath.  Because they just don't feel like...  Bobby's dick smelled.  Changing the linens or whatever.  You caught no fish?  Bobby caught three in four hours.  Exactly.  One fish an hour?  I could catch more fish.  If I stood in the fucking water with my asshole open.  And let trout accidentally fall into it.  You'd be going like, ow though. 
[03:18:00]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  I get the fin in, but...  Spanky writes, just tuned in.  Oh, did you just say Jimmy took one in the shitter?  See, that's the problem with people not listening to the whole show.  You might have to listen to the replay today.  That might.  Fucking blithering idiot caught three fish?  Three trout.  In four hours?  And by the way, I saw a picture.  How big were those fucking trout?  They looked pretty small.  Uh, the one I don't know if I captured was pretty impressive, to be honest with you.  And then two small ones.  Yeah, here's what that is.  I don't know what a good-sized trout is, so I don't know.  Average this out. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  That's 240 minutes.  That's one fish every 80 fucking minutes.  Look at that thing.  And there's Tony.  Look how small that fish is.  What is that?  Well, that's a trout.  Is that the bait?  And that's Tony, our guide, who pretty much had it with us by the end of the day.  No shit.  We were just goofing off the whole time.  Is that actually a...  He's a serious fly fisherman.  Bob caught that, and he's holding it?  Yeah.  I hope he's apologizing.  Do you see the cigarette in his mouth as we're trying to enjoy nature?  This fucking chain smoker?  Here's what it is.  When you see somebody catch a fish, and they're proud of it, they're holding it up by the gills. 
[03:19:00]  And they're like, and you can tell it takes a little bit to loft that fish up, and you're  like, proud of it.  He's holding this fish in his hand, much like you would just hold your dick while you're jerking  off.  Except the fucking fish is smaller.  His hand wraps around the entire fish.  I went up there with a, let's get this over with, maybe make some videos, but by the end, 
[03:19:30]  I'm a bit hooked on this thing.  You caught nothing?  Hooked on what?  Well, Tony, which you're seeing a picture of if you go to my Twitter, OP Radio, he said  it took him a year to catch his first trout.  He has nothing.  You've got to figure zero that guy is.  He's doing his off time, make crystal meth with the motorcycle gang.  Look, man, he's a...  Fucking, that fish stinks.  He's a non-vet.  Horrible.  And he wanted to know if I was a drinking man.  Really?  Because he had some Jack Daniels.  A year to catch a fucking trout?  That's supposed to be inspirational?  Oh, good.  Only 364 more days until I can fucking reel in something the size of a mealworm. 
[03:20:00]  You've got to figure out what they're fucking biting at.  What was Bob using his bait?  Fucking beach balls?  That's fucking awful.  You should have yelled incoming and watched him dive into the water.  I can watch Tony burrow under a shrub.  Fucking rotten beard.  You've got to figure out, you know, the whole match to hatch.  Yeah, well, you didn't do it.  Look, we went down to the river and we started studying the river.  I'm like, ah.  And Tony goes, ah, look at that.  And I'm like, oh, and we're all going, ah, and then you look at your fucking flies that  Tony has all over his body, you know, the fishing flies, and then you match the hatch. 
[03:20:30]  You figure out what insects are hanging out on the surface of the river, and then you  fucking match that shit.  You know what doesn't make sense about that?  What?  Say you're a fucking fish, and now you're looking around, you see all this shit floating  around, and you go, all right, I'll match it with this fly.  Right.  Well, wouldn't that be like this fucking cheeseburgers all over the fucking place, and then someone  wheels in a steak.  Don't you want the steak?  That's what I asked Tony.  He goes, nah, these fucking fish, they see hundreds of fishermen every day.  They're smart.  They know what the fuck's going on. 
[03:21:00]  No, they don't.  They're dumb.  They know what the fuck's going on.  They have a feeling in their, their brain is the size of a pea, by the way.  Of course it is.  But they have a feeling in their, like-  Like our own E-Rog.  In spring, they eat the big bugs, like crickets and shit.  By the end of the season, like I went, the fucking flies looked like a piece of lint on  your clothing.  That was it?  That was it.  It's a whole game you're playing with the fish and nature.  Exactly.  You're trying to fool this prehistoric idiot fucking animal.  And as you're whipping that fucking rod back and forth, you're hoping you're not taking  your own eye out.  I would just go out and close my eyes all the time. 
[03:21:30]  I'm like, that's not-  Go get a fucking worm and dangle it in and catch something.  That's it.  That's how it is.  Then you got the waders on, and you're up to your waist in very cold water, but it  feels kind of good in a weird fucking way.  How about you just take a net and stand there and wait for these faggots fucking to swim  into it?  No, they're just out of reach, Jimmy.  That's the frustrating part about it.  Were you really scared that hook was going to go into your eye?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it's flying back and forth.  Watch more glasses.  I was wearing sunglasses, but it was a cloudy day, so he kept taking them off.  It was a little too dark.  Do they have goggles for that shit? 
[03:22:00]  I can't imagine.  I can't wait until Bob loses an eye.  I can't wait.  You know what?  Dude, I can't drive, but you know what?  I got my health.  My coffee.  You know what?  Dude, boom.  Can you have a cup of coffee?  So what?  I can only read half the paper.  You know what, dude?  He can eat, man.  Of course he can.  I had three meals with the guy.  He's getting a little bigger.  I was like, I thought he was trying to keep his weight off.  And then he was dreaming about, I want to be an older guy that's in shape where I can  walk down the beach, dude, with my wife.  Did he say that? 
[03:22:30]  And have good bodies.  Did he say that?  He's like, me and Don are going to stop smoking soon.  And we're going to fucking start eating, right at exercise.  And I'm like, isn't what he's been telling everyone he's doing?  What are you waiting for?  His wife's in good shape.  His wife doesn't need to do anything except fucking find a guy in better shape.  That's all his wife needs to do.  Bob's the problem, not her.  Yeah, his wife's keeping it all together big time.  Did the girls go?  Well, his did mine.  She opted out.  Yeah, she had all that.  Oh, shit.  Because then I wanted to go back to Geneseo for homecoming, and I can't make a fucking decision. 
[03:23:00]  So then she's like, well, as you not make a decision, I'm going to come up with something  that I could do tonight.  And then finally I went up there, at the last minute, literally, and said, oh, fuck it.  I'll do this with Bobby.  But it's, I don't know.  I liked it.  Communing with nature.  I kind of liked it.  You caught no fish.  It was a wasted day.  Dude, and I grew up fishing for blues and all that shit, and dumb snappers, and snagging  fucking, what the hell, the bunkers, the bunker fishing stuff. 
[03:23:30]  That's my share of fishing over here.  I'll catch a fucking trout with a worm.  This was more fun than catching a lot of fish.  No, it wasn't.  Because you're trying to figure it out.  And at one point, Tony goes, Tony, me and Bobby over and over, and you kind of see the  fish bubbling up and grabbing bugs.  You see them.  You're like, fuck!  And all of a sudden, Tony goes, ah!  Reel in your lines, boys, or whatever.  And he changes the fly, and within two minutes, Bobby caught his first fucking fish.  This Tony knew what the fuck.  How long was Bobby doing that before fucking Tony told him to wheel it in? 
[03:24:00]  And, I don't know, that could have been, I don't know.  An hour?  Time goes by very fast when you're in nature there, Jimmy.  Yeah, probably four hours went by like that.  Behind your back, you probably sprayed the fly with, like, fucking fish, beautiful vagina  spray.  It's the same as the human stuff.  So wait, how many did Tony catch?  Tony didn't want to fucking fly fish.  He was too busy, like, you know, throwing down some sauce.  Look at Bobby's got his cup of coffee!  You know what, boom, dude, you got your fucking coffee, bang, you're right ready to go. 
[03:24:30]  We go to the general store, pick up some supplies, we'll be out there, hours.  Hey, you ready, you ready?  We're gonna go fishing.  My first video's up, we're gonna have four.  My first video shows me just sitting in my car, staring at my motel room door.  Because I didn't like, I just didn't want to go in the room.  And I'll have others, but OP Radio on YouTube, if you want to see the first one, part one.  Rented his rubber pants?  Yeah, the rubber pants were alright, you know.  They're not alright.  Other men have worn them and pissed through them. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, Jimmy, I forgot to tell you this.  Raining the whole time as I'm not catching fish.  Oh, that's wonderful.  What a nightmare.  It's not fun.  Just getting soaked because I don't have a fucking rain fucking jacket.  You understand, I caught as many fish almost getting fucked in the ass as you did standing there.  But Tony, then Tony is playing this shit and I had to tell him.  Well, Tony knew I had a problem.  I mean, I was starting to like, I was starting to figure out how to do the 10 and 2 and get the fucking line out there.  I was doing alright with that. 
[03:25:30]  And that was exciting to me.  I'm like, oh, I get it.  Cool.  And all of a sudden, Tony realized that I was not going to catch any fish.  So he started taking my reel and he was starting to do some real fucking fly fishing.  And then he actually said to me, if I hook this fish, I'm going to give you the rod.  I go, Tony, motherfucker, I want to catch my own fucking fish with my own fucking cast.  I'm not one of those guys where you're going to catch it and then, oh, look, I reel it in.  What did Tony catch?  He caught nothing.  Sounds like a great day.  He was too busy.  Three men caught. 
[03:26:00]  He was too busy going back to the car a little too many times.  Oh, really?  One guy's running back to fucking drink fucking apparently lighter fluid.  And that fucking blithering idiot smoking and drinking a cup of coffee and catching that minuscule fucking fish.  You've got to see.  Smoking fucking opium from Thailand that he's gotten since 69.  It was a dumb 30 bucks for me to get a rod and some waders and that was it, right?  And some fucking flies and a little thing so I could switch up my flies even though I didn't have to.  Bobby has everything you could ever want for fly fish. 
[03:26:30]  Except fucking skill.  Get him on the phone.  He has no skill.  He caught three.  Big deal.  He stood there for four hours.  I could have caught ten four hours with a worm.  Yeah.  Three little things.  Little shit fish.  There's nowhere to hang out in this town.  Bears just walk in and grab them.  Yeah.  Beaver kill?  Beaver kill, yeah.  That's the area.  25-year rod guarantee?  Yeah, I don't know.  Wow.  I don't know what that means.  Beaver kill angling, I guess.  Honestly, everyone.  Bob thinks he's an angler. 
[03:27:00]  Everyone in Roscoe, New York, they were very nice to us.  They look a little inbred, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Bunch of tards.  A little crooked in the eyes, but they were hospital.  They're blithering idiots.  Does the whole place just smell like fish?  They can't get enough of their trout.  They love their fucking stupid trout.  It is everywhere.  It's on the menus.  It's fucking stuffed down.  Fresh out of the river.  It's everywhere, dude.  Every fucking where.  Hold on there.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You get to keep the fish?  I don't know.  I didn't catch any, remember? 
[03:27:30]  No, Bobby does catch and release.  Catch and release?  What the fuck?  What are you going to do with the fucking trout?  We don't get to cook that shit.  That one?  You cook it, it'll disappear.  I love how Jimmy gets so upset.  Because, dude, he fucking wasted the whole day.  Caught nothing.  It was a big waste of time.  That shitty fish.  When your fingers wrap around a fish, you have wasted your day.  Yeah.  That's a goldfish.  A lot of people say there's not many fish in the rivers this late in the year.  Really?  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah.  Then how about people don't fucking fish? 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, but what is he fucking taking out there for?  I kind of like being in the fucking river up to my waist in cold water.  In the rain.  In the rain.  I liked it.  That doesn't sound good.  For real, I liked it.  I'll tell you where I was.  I was in a fucking 93 degree pool in the rain.  I understand.  Where you have very different lives.  It was wonderful.  It wasn't fishing, mind you.  I had a Guinness fish in my hand.  Well, you were in that thing all night at the party.  Oh, it was wonderful.  It was fantastic.  It's raining.  I don't give a shit.  Phil B. in Tennessee.  He's checking out the pictures on my Twitter. 
[03:28:30]  He goes, let's see.  It looks like Bob is holding his bait, not his catch.  Yes!  That is a tiny little fish.  If you want to fish, go bass fishing and without that bald coffee drinking dolt.  Yep.  Or, you know what?  Deep sea fishing.  Then you're putting up a fight with the goddamn fish.  We can't get Bobby.  You get a grappling hook with a fucking steak on the end of it.  You throw it in and something giant eats it and then you got to try to reel it in.  And I love how Bobby, I go, when we were getting this together and a few listeners were cool enough, 
[03:29:00]  they're like, look, I got a house up there.  It's a really nice house.  And one guy said, I'm not even going to be there.  I'll give you the fucking key.  And Bobby's like, what?  That's crazy.  We got a hotel, dude.  You should have saw the fucking shithole we stayed at.  It was like a serial killer motel for real.  And the guy who owned it didn't speak English, was sauced.  He smelled like alcohol and curry.  There's nothing else to do up there but drink.  No.  And I'm sure after a while.  I was talking about my house.  Oh.  I'm sure after a while you're sick of the trout, too.  You know what, dude?  You stand out there. 
[03:29:30]  It's raining.  You're in the water.  Boom.  Got your coffee, your cigarette.  Pow.  You just boom.  Shut up.  You just boom.  All right.  This guy wants to explain what's up with the fly fishing.  All righty.  I think it's Reed.  Reed, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hi, Robert.  What would I rather do than fly fish?  Yeah.  See?  Reed?  Even Potoski, Michigan.  Oops.  You know where that is?  No.  No?  Okay.  Right by the Mackinac Bridge.  Not too far from Mackinac. 
[03:30:00]  And we fly fish up here all the time.  And we don't catch big fish, you know?  I mean, but we catch fish.  But it's just so much fun.  It's not all in catching the fish.  It's like seeing what's out there.  No, you raise a good point, dude.  It's like, you know, if you see, like, you know, beavers swimming around or a mink playing,  you know, in the water or a fawn go by, that's all good, you know?  What the fuck are you in?  I can watch that on Discovery.  Well, you know, yeah, Discovery TV. 
[03:30:30]  Beavers and fucking mink.  You used to be a nature guy, eh?  With the guns and the desert and all that shit.  He's violent.  He's not a nature guy.  Yeah, I like to hang out.  Yeah.  You know, I was brought up and raised in Detroit, Michigan, you know?  Murder city, you know?  I moved up here in 1990.  It took me over a year to catch my first fish and fly fishing.  Thank God you stuck it out.  Oh, yeah.  That's exciting when you finally get that fucker.  You go, look, I outsmarted the little trout with the pea brains. 
[03:31:00]  Because in Detroit, fly fishing is, like, really cool fishing.  Yeah.  Yeah, because it's the most cannibalistic fishing, you know?  It's the only time you fish a hook.  You know, with a worm, you don't see that fish take that bait.  You don't see the pole go down.  When you're fly fishing, you see that fish take that bait.  That's right.  Let me tell you something.  That's right.  I've been deep sea fishing, my friend.  And don't make it sound like shit.  Because when you're sitting there, and then you see your line.  That's not a deep sea fish.  You are like, don't.  And you see, and you see your line go like, and then you pull that fucking thing, and the line goes out. 
[03:31:30]  You're fighting something big.  Not this little, look at that.  Okay.  Danny just pulled a picture up.  That's cool, too.  The fish is as big as the fucking guy.  I understand, but there was a whole strategy thing in trying to figure out what the fish should do.  How is to land that fucker, Bobby?  Oh, Bobby's on the line.  All right, Reed, I've got to let you go.  We've got Robert Kelly on the line.  Wait, Reed.  Bobby! 
[03:32:00]  Yo!  Match the hatch, brother!  There he is.  Bobby, they're killing me here.  Help me out with this.  Jimmy doesn't understand that we stood in water up to our waist, cold water, for four hours, and you caught three and I caught nothing.  Bob, that was a cool photo of you holding that contact lens.  He thought your fish was a little small.  Yeah.  Listen, first of all, my fish, that one you saw was small. 
[03:32:30]  The other one was around 13 inches, which is pretty big.  The one that got away?  Even a cock size.  Yeah, even Tony, who's seen a few trout in his day, goes, that's a good-sized trout right there.  Well, Tony's word is gospel, apparently, according to YouTube.  Tony said that must be so.  Suck his cock.  We liked Tony until he almost had us into a fucking huge T-bone accident.  Oh, really?  Bobby goes, Tony, that was a green light for them.  Oh, man.  He goes, I know, I know, I know, I know.  I'm colorblind. 
[03:33:00]  I think he starts saucing at 8 in the morning.  I'm standing.  I'm still up here, dude.  I'm in a river right now.  What?  No way.  Are you really?  I'm standing in the river right now.  Wait, splash the water.  Drown yourself.  Yeah.  Splash the water.  We don't believe you.  I swear to God, I'm here right now.  All right, did you catch anything since I left?  No, there's a guy next to me.  He's using fucking worms, and he's catching every fish in the fucking lake.  That's what I fucking said.  Jimmy just said that.  I said I'd catch more with a worm while you two fucking idiots are, match the hatch.  Let's see if they're a little buggy. 
[03:33:30]  Shut up.  Put a worm on the fucking hook and reel in a dinner.  Yeah, but that's boring.  It's not boring.  There's nothing to it.  You want to do it with yourself.  You want to try to figure it out, like how they're doing it naturally, and you're a part  of that.  Get it out.  Get a fucking worm.  And you got to make sure your line doesn't drag.  I learned that.  Or your fly.  You want it to float down the river.  Naturally.  Three fish.  And then when it starts dragging, the fish knows, oh, that's a fake one.  Fuck that.  You guys are a moron.  It's like taking a bullet and throwing it at deer instead of using a gun.  Absolutely right, Anthony.  That's exactly what it is.  It's like a bunch of bunk.  It would be easier.  If I'm going fly fishing, I don't use the worms there. 
[03:34:00]  No way.  No?  No way, no how.  Look at you, you're a purist now.  I'm a purist.  You've been out four hours in the rain, didn't catch one fish, but you're a purist.  I think I might have got a bite.  A bite?  Maybe.  Of the mosquito variety?  I hope his cast is natural.  He's a natural fly fisherman.  No, I am.  Must come from the golf swing.  Well, they said don't break your wrist, Dan.  Very good.  Really?  Yeah.  But a few of my casts did end up in the trees behind me.  Ah.  Yeah.  Well, to be expected.  Jimmy's very angry, Bobby. 
[03:34:30]  What happens?  Fishing.  Jimmy's angry.  Jimmy.  I'm bothered by the waste.  Bob.  Fucking.  You caught one fish every 80 minutes.  Yes.  That's terrible.  Yeah, but it's not about the...  I caught three fish.  Yeah, that's good.  If I caught one, it would have been a perfect day.  That's great for a retarded boy.  A retarded boy runs out there with his fucking dopey boy fishing pole with a fucking piece  of gum on the end of it.  Don't beat Floyd.  Stupid hat. 
[03:35:00]  What do you think of going out with a net?  You think I'm a Japanese fisherman?  Why wouldn't you?  You'd catch more.  Go out there with fucking something else.  Go out there with anything.  No, if you want to catch...  Put an apple on the line, you would have caught more.  If you want to catch more fish, then fly fishing isn't for you, Jimmy.  Sure it is.  Just say you want to stand in the water.  Leave the pole home and just stand in the water and wave at fish.  That's kind of what we did.  I have to take a shit so bad right now, but I'm in the middle of nowhere.  Shit in your waders.  Some shit in the fucking water.  Exactly.  I'm sure somebody will fucking catch it.  You watch those trout. 
[03:35:30]  I bet you they enjoy a little shit sandwich.  Hey, Bobby, how awful was that room?  You're still in it?  Yeah, the fucking room is awful.  If you were staying up there, why wouldn't you move rooms to something nicer?  To where?  Yeah, that's true.  It's not about that, dude.  It's about being here.  Part of it's the room.  You know what, dude?  You get up here, you're with nature.  You leave all the luxury behind, dude.  Boom.  You got your coffee.  You got your kabings.  What?  Kabings.  And your things. 
[03:36:00]  I don't like that I'm starting to enjoy him imitating me.  Oh, I'm loving the additions Jimmy's making.  What else could you tell the boys about our fly fishing extravaganza?  Besides the fact it was a monumental bust.  No, no, it was not.  Three fish is a lot, Jimmo.  Three fish is a lot.  If you fish for ten minutes, three fish is a lot.  For four hours, I caught more than that in fucking Phoenix, outside my hotel in the desert.  You know what, Bobby?  I'm thinking we can't invite Jimmy fly fishing.  He doesn't understand it.  You're too excited. 
[03:36:30]  You can't come with us.  You can invite me.  Nope.  And I'll be happy to offer to drive you.  So you're both standing out there with your fucking waders in buckets, and you realize,  oh, he's not coming.  We're not inviting him.  First of all, if he stands on the shore, the fish are all going to come up to him.  They're going to think he's a worm anyway.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, Bob.  I'm glad you're making sport of my physical shortcomings.  But that doesn't change the fact that three fish in four hours is atrocious.  Three fish in four hours is fantastic.  It's not. 
[03:37:00]  The fish is that we matched the hatch.  We did match the hatch.  I totally get it now.  We weren't catching anything, and then we caught a bug in the air and found the fly.  I want to match his house after hearing him say match the hatch so many times.  Look, you guys.  I'm done with him.  Look, you just look at the bugs, and you go, oh, and then you see, oh, my fucking fly  looks like that thing.  What if you have no flies that look like the bugs?  Then you're in deep shit.  You've got to have some experience.  You've got to see what kind of flies might be out there to begin with, or what kind  of bugs are out there to begin with. 
[03:37:30]  Right?  Right.  That's right.  Did you feel like Tony might kill us while we were out there?  Either that or fuck us.  Oh, wow.  That's a good match the hatch.  It's a good match the hatch.  And what about the motel owner?  Oh, that's frigging angry.  He looks like every Asian guy that's been in every movie ever.  But he's Indian.  The karate master.  How did the stupid fish not see that hook?  It's like, oh, it's a bug that looks just like the ones that are swimming around, except 
[03:38:00]  this one's got a big metal hook in it.  Let me have that.  Yummy.  Listen.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Do you have your dogs?  Does anybody fuck with you for your, because you have a fucking arsenal at your house?  Well, what about my arsenal?  It's fun.  I go target shooting with it.  I don't have to match the hatch.  It's ridiculous to something.  What should I use?  Nine millimeter or a 40 caliber on this target.  I don't have to match anything.  It's just fucking shooting. 
[03:38:30]  It's fun.  It has nothing to do with your fishing.  Well, let's get Bobby back on the river there.  Thanks, please.  I need to go take a shit, dude.  All right, Bobby.  That's what you've been doing all day.  That's what you did yesterday with Hope.  It was a giant shit in the river.  You know what?  Calling it stinks.  Dude, I hope there's a giant fucking hole in there and you step into it and you fall and  your cell phone gets all wet.  And the other, one other thing, and then we'll move on from this shit.  But I knew I was the problem in the bunch because I'm casting and I'm just disturbing everything. 
[03:39:00]  Because before you place your fly in the water, you're doing the 10 and 2 and trying to get  it so you can really get it out there.  And then when you feel good, you kind of let it go forward, right?  But my fly is like smacking the water over and over again because I can't keep it in the  air long enough.  And Tony finally realized I could be the problem in the group.  So he goes, hey, Bobby, come with me.  Brings Bobby way the fuck down the river.  And someone got his dick sucked behind a bush, didn't he, Bobby? 
[03:39:30]  So then my splashing wasn't going to disturb Bobby's fish time with Tony.  Right.  And then all of a sudden Bobby started catching fish like crazy because, you know, he didn't  have me disrupting everything around me.  Somebody got their dick sucked while they were holding the little fishy, didn't they?  I think Tony handed Bob a plastic fish and sucked his cock while he looked at it.  Pulled his little penis out of his waders.  It was all cold from the chilly water hitting it.  Popped in his mouth like an acorn.  It's like when you're a kid, you take your snowsuit off and your dick's all shriveled 
[03:40:00]  and tiny.  That's how Bob's weenie looked in his fucking wader pants.  While some older gentleman put Jack Daniels breath on it.  Sucked the cock and balls at the same time.  You know what, Dan?  I'm holding a little fish.  I'm getting a blowjob.  What else is there?  Hey, man.  There was a lot of exercise.  We got out of that river.  Our fucking legs were cold.  We were a little wobbly.  Trying to get the warmth back, right?  Bob, did you get my picture text, by the way?  No. 
[03:40:30]  Fucking God damn it.  All right, Bobby.  We'll let you go.  I'll try to send it to you.  Did you upgrade your phone, Bobby?  No.  How do you do that?  No.  Your iPhone.  Did you plug it into fucking iTunes and get it where you can text pictures now?  No.  I've been out in the wilderness.  Oh, see?  That's why I didn't get it there, Jim.  I'm crossing a river right now.  All right, Bobby.  I'm up to my waist.  Redding from Wack Bag.  Of course, Jimmy isn't invited to match the hatch.  Jim Norton is an uninvited guest.  Oh. 
[03:41:00]  A little plug.  Hey, Bobby.  Are they inbred up there?  I'm really trying to work with you, Bobby.  You all right?  He's busy.  He's fishing.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm in the middle of a river right now.  Up to my waist, and there's a pretty strong current.  I'm over fucking ice on the river.  Bye-bye.  Oh, please.  I'll talk to you guys later.  I'd love to find his body crunched at the bottom of a fucking illiquid-y ravine with his legs smashed.  Obviously, he had caught in the undertow, and it took him over a fucking waterfall, and he's impaled on a fucking fly fishing rod. 
[03:41:30]  What happens to Bobby when he's on the phone?  It's hard with the river and stuff.  He was a lot of fun yesterday.  It's hard to call in.  We get him to call in to help out with the stories, and he's got nothing.  No river.  What the hell is he going to do?  Attention, anglers.  Still convinced that fishing is a sport?  Well, renowned sportsman James Norton presents the ultimate cure for your delusion.  How smart do you have to be to beat this animal psychologically?  What a dumb animal the fish is.  Introducing, fishing is not a sport, you douche.  It's not a sport. 
[03:42:00]  It's not a sport.  Go in the water with your fist and punch the fish.  That's a sport.  You're standing in a fucking boat.  It's not a sport.  You have a hook, and the fish has nothing but hunger.  This collection is presented on nine full-length, high-fidelity audio cassettes, and will thoroughly  convince you that your leisure activity is a colossal waste of time.  You and some other jizz bucket and fucking waders and a big gut standing there in 10-degree  water, strinking Pabst Blue Ribbon, trying to hook some asshole fish.  You're not a sportsman.  You're not out there sporting.  Despite what you may think, fishing is not a battle of wits. 
[03:42:30]  It's not stacked equally between a dumb fucking fish who has been doing the same thing since  dinosaurs were shitting all over Manhattan.  You understand, that fish was no smarter when a Tyrannosaurus was shitting on 70th Street  and Broadway.  Put down that stupid fishing pole and pick up your copies of Fishing is Not a Sport, you  douche.  Narrated by James Norton.  I'm just letting you know, you're not a sportsman.  On the Virus, Sirius 197, XM 202. 
[03:43:00]  It's the worst of 2009 countdown for the Opie and Anthony Show with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, in 2009, it became more apparent that your dad has become a super fan of the program.  A super fan, and in his mind, a superstar, as this happened at the beginning of the year,  I think.  Yeah, this was when we were still on Terrestrial.  Yeah.  And he still has brought it up.  Every time it gets replayed, he leaves me a voicemail saying,  Hey, is Opie going to give me some royalties?  He's, I mean, just like, he's just so into it. 
[03:43:30]  Your dad's like a traveling vaudeville act.  He is a traveling vaudeville act.  And that's why he deserves to be on the Worst of 2009.  Because, because of my dad's odd eating habits, you got to eat some of the most disgusting foods  that are, in his words, the world's greatest treats.  How did this come up?  Was this just something that randomly you threw out there?  I think I mentioned on the air, sometimes I throw my family under the bus for no reason on the air.  Okay.  I mentioned on the air that my dad drinks buttermilk and eats sardines out of the can. 
[03:44:00]  I gave my dad's phone number to the call screener, and my dad called in and defended himself for eating raw potatoes,  which are good, I eat raw potatoes, but for eating raw potatoes with salt, along with sardine and onion sandwiches,  garlic pickles, oh yeah, big garlic pickles, and buttermilk.  And, of course, so it involved food.  So they come up with, well, you know what? 
[03:44:30]  E-Rock has to do it.  Yes.  They said, this can't be good.  E-Rock, you must try it.  Yeah, so I did enjoy some of the greatest treats of all time.  Wow, you didn't really enjoy them.  I like the pickles.  Yes, you do like your treats.  Potato wasn't bad either.  The rest of it, oh, the dry rye bread, too.  Yeah, the dry rye bread, of course.  The greatest treats of all time.  Dad, this is for you.  It's number 26 on the Worst of 2009 countdown.  It's the Worst of 2009. 
[03:45:00]  Let's have E-Rock try the greatest treats, or some of the greatest treats of all time.  Wait a minute, look at it.  It's all stacked up.  What is that?  This is a whole can of sardines.  A whole can of sardines, okay.  Yeah, and then two slices of onion that are about a quarter inch thick.  Yeah.  They kind of fell apart a little bit, so I spread it out across.  Oh, the pickle's on the sandwich, too?  No, the pickle is right here with the raw potato.  That's a little snack on the side.  A whole little snack. 
[03:45:30]  And then I waited.  I didn't put the buttermilk concoction together yet.  Oh, no.  You've got to eat, you know, the crackers out of the buttermilk right away.  And that's like dessert.  That's dessert.  And your dad would be proud of how you prepared some of the greatest treats of all time?  This is something.  He would look at this sandwich and say, oh, my goodness.  What did I do to deserve such a treat?  You're an ass.  Here, present some of the greatest treats of all time with the pickle and the raw potato.  Okay.  Get a little picture here before we move it over to E-Rock. 
[03:46:00]  It's prison food.  Look at it.  It looks like it belongs on a prison tray.  Yeah, absolutely.  You going to eat that?  All right.  E-Rock, you ready to try some of the greatest treats of all time?  We have some salt for the potato if you prefer with salt.  Some people do.  Some people do.  I prefer pepper, actually.  Oh, really?  What about your dad?  He likes salt.  He likes salt on that potato.  He pours salt on everything, though.  He doesn't even taste.  He just pours salt on that.  What else does this health nut do? 
[03:46:30]  Salt on everything and buttermilk.  Buttermilk.  Did he prepare the buttermilk with the crackers?  Well, I wanted to wait until just before he eats the crackers so that way they don't lose their crunch.  He's going to be able to squeeze mustache wax out of his aorta.  I definitely think he should start with the sandwich because, as we discussed, the cracker buttermilk concoction is a treat.  It's like dessert.  But it's timely.  You've got to watch the timing on that one.  How does he wash down the sardine sandwich? 
[03:47:00]  How about if you have the buttermilk and occasionally you sprinkle a cracker in when Fatso has to wash down a little bit of a...  I'm just for the bit.  He just threw his arms up in the air.  When he wants to wash down some, you give him a little bit of buttermilk and you sprinkle some cracker and he spoons it into his mouth.  And that way you're eating a little treat along with the sandwich.  I want to keep the authenticity of Sam's dad and his consumption habits.  Does your dad ever just drink buttermilk in a glass?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay, then that's fine.  Then give him a little glass of buttermilk to wash it down. 
[03:47:30]  Worsh.  Would anybody like to smell the buttermilk?  I'd like to smell it, yeah.  That's a lot of worsh.  I don't even have to get it too close.  Oh, my God.  It is very strong.  It's like soury.  I can't smell that.  It kind of smells like the milk went bad.  No, there's a little more going on in there.  Oh, God.  This is disgusting.  It smells like breast milk, Anthony.  No, shut up.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yes, thank you.  Oh, God.  That's the reaction I had, too.  There's a sour butter smell. 
[03:48:00]  It's a salty treat.  It actually probably is good with crackers, I got to say.  Oh, no effing way.  It's probably good with crackers.  No, it's not.  Then eat it.  Eric, make sure that you take a big smell of it right before you take a gulp.  All right.  Bring it over.  All right.  Here's the...  Let's see what it looks like when you pour it.  I want to see what it looks like.  Well, it is thick.  It certainly is thick, Anthony.  Oh, you can't even hear it.  You know how liquid when you can't hear it?  No, no.  It just kind of goes into itself.  It's like you're pouring motor oil.  This is one entity.  You're pouring, like, mercury or something, right? 
[03:48:30]  I'll put that in a crankcase like that.  40-weight milk.  It's very viscous-y.  All right.  Where do you want them to eat this?  Right here.  Do it on camera, or do you want me to do it over there?  Yeah.  They're filming it.  Come over here.  Go over there.  I'm not.  I'll set up.  We want you close.  Get over there now.  I'll just put the top piece of bread on the sandwich.  Uh-huh.  Look at that.  Tomorrow, we'll have sandwiches.  There you go.  Let's see.  What's wrong?  The onion smell.  Well, do you like onions, E-Rock? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, I do.  It's just strong.  Do you like sardines?  I've never had sardines.  They're actually good.  Oh, wait.  Maybe in, like, Caesar salad or something, but that's about right.  Sardines and Caesar salad?  Oh, it's anchovies?  Yeah.  Whatever.  Sardines?  Eric, you'll like this.  All right.  Which am I eating first?  Well, this.  Have the sandwich.  This is just your side dish.  Okay.  Your side dish.  You should try a sip of buttermilk first before you taint your mouth.  They want you to wash out your palate with some buttermilk.  Yeah, cleanse out your palate with some buttermilk. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, just have a sip of buttermilk.  Smell the buttermilk first.  It's not bad.  Like a fine wine.  Smells like butter.  Give it a smell.  It's clumpy.  Why are you shaking?  I don't know.  Yeah.  It smells like ranch dressing.  Really?  Really?  Well, you've drank that before.  He brings in a thermos.  All right.  A little swig of buttermilk.  Have a sip.  Just, yeah. 
[03:50:00]  Hey, Sam's dad drinks.  Go ahead.  Here he goes.  It's probably good, Iraq.  Yeah, it is good.  It's terrible.  Oof.  Here he goes.  What's wrong?  Enjoy.  It's a great treat.  Yeah.  Enjoy the buttermilk.  Oh.  What happened?  All right.  So the great treat so far is a bust.  What happened, Iraq?  Is he enjoying it? 
[03:50:30]  He's gagging.  There's buttermilk all over the garbage.  It's just dumb buttermilk.  What happened that it made you gag like that?  Um, well, the salt separated from the, what tastes like really sour milk, so you're getting  the best of both.  Is it really that bad?  This is the part.  It's not bad when you first drink it.  Dude.  But as you start to, it starts to separate.  People like butter.  People like milk.  That is the byproduct that's left over. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  Why would you drink it?  Why would you?  Exactly.  Buttermilk stinks.  You want some crackers?  Well, you've got to put it in the buttermilk.  But that's dessert.  All right.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Don't spoil the boys' meal.  His actual first course, the sardines, onions, on some wonderful green bread stuff.  No, no.  Take a bite out of the middle.  Oh, shut up.  Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Why don't we cut the sandwich in half so you get a nice bite of goodness?  Well, he's eating the whole thing.  You have to.  Yeah. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, I can't.  Take a bite out of the middle.  Oh, you've got to eat the whole thing.  Wait.  There you go.  Come on, kid.  He's lifting up the sardine and onion sandwich.  It's perfect for 7 o'clock in the morning.  Hey, he's dropping the onions out of the sandwich.  Yeah.  Don't lose any onions.  What's wrong, boy?  You miss out on flavor.  All right.  He's about to bite into some of the greatest treats of all time, according to Sam's dad.  The middle, not the side.  There's no...  You're an ass.  He's shaking.  Why are you shaking?  Because this smells horrible.  Oh, my God.  He's...  How is it? 
[03:52:00]  It sounds so dry.  Yeah, I know.  You hear that.  He's making a face.  He's not happy.  Eat the canned fish.  Good.  It's not as bad as I thought it would be.  Oh.  So it is the greatest treat.  It's the onions that is making this worse.  Have another bite.  Mm-hmm.  What is it?  I can't suck down the first part.  Well, wash it down with some buttermilk.  Yeah.  Come on.  You have a delicious beverage there.  Worship the taste. 
[03:52:30]  Make it into a nice, buttery, salty, milk byproduct, fishy, pasty...  Yeah, wash it down.  Wash it down with some byproduct.  Enjoy.  A nice sip.  Thick buttermilk.  I'm going to love this.  There you go.  Come on.  Come on, Iraq.  It should be drained out of the Trojan.  Here he goes.  Come on, Iraq.  You can do this.  Making down that buttermilk, washing down that...  Attaboy.  There you go.  Oh, my God. 
[03:53:00]  He's shaking.  He's shaking.  Oh, no.  Have a bite of potato.  Have a bite of potato.  Potato.  That'll help out.  There you go.  A bite of raw potato.  Raw potato.  Raw potato.  Shut up.  A big bite.  A big bite.  That's how Sam's dad does it.  There he is.  Oh, my God.  It's like he just ate a rock.  He just ate a rock. 
[03:53:30]  Listen to that.  Crunch.  Nothing crunches like that.  A potato, guys.  No.  A potato.  How's the raw potato?  That's not bad.  The potato actually is a welcome treat to all of us.  Wow.  All right.  A welcome treat.  So what you do is you go from bad to worse, and by the end, it's a miracle.  Yeah.  It's the wonderful...  Boy, your house must sound like termites, all right, with all of you just eating raw potatoes.  Do you laugh at how much each crunch is?  Do you and your dad like crunch and then laugh? 
[03:54:00]  Let's go to Ryan real fast in Indiana.  Ryan.  Hey, E-Rock, look on the bright side, buddy.  At least your breath smells better now.  Oh, bad breath.  That's not...  Bad breath.  That's not nice.  Hey, you want to dip the sardine sandwich into the buttermilk?  You know how people like to dip their sandwiches a little bit?  A little bit, a little bit.  Might.  Or how about a sandwich, E-Rock?  How about another big bite of the sardine and onion sandwich?  Yeah.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Get a good one.  Get a good one. 
[03:54:30]  That a boy.  There you go.  He's digging in.  Mmm.  Yummy.  Nice, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It's our time, E-Rock.  You're absolutely right.  Is this one of the worst things we've made you do?  I can tell by your face.  His face is red and on the verge of lots of tears.  Some of the world's greatest treats.  According to Sam's dad, yes.  Wow. 
[03:55:00]  How about a sip of buttermilk?  Oh, well, wash it down.  Wash it down.  A little buttermilk.  Wash it down.  Wash that down with some, mmm, delicious buttermilk.  Here we go.  So thick and creamy.  Not quite butter.  Not quite milk.  That's the stuff at the bottom of the bucket in the barn after they lift the cow's filthy  udders out.  Are there any black, crusty things that fell off the cow's teeth?  Oh, you got a sardine bone? 
[03:55:30]  Oh, sardine bone in your tooth?  Yeah, washing completely boneless.  Oh.  All right.  Get a nice sip of buttermilk.  You're eating like a stray cat.  Yeah.  Come on.  Let's get some buttermilk in here.  Yeah.  They drape the buttermilk.  Get a good one.  Nice big gulp will wash that right down, E-Rod.  They do scrape the buttermilk, right?  Yeah, they scrape it from the bottom of the barrel.  Oh, yeah.  It smells sour.  Oh, it's all the goodness that's left over. 
[03:56:00]  It's probably a little like cow urine in the milk.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's got to be.  It's a little of everything.  It might even be some, you know, baby maker in there.  When you look at a cow's udders, there are a lot of nooks and crannies in between the udders.  And what collects in there is this dirt.  Dirt, sweat.  It's manure.  Yeah.  It's sweat.  Yeah.  It's other stuff, and it actually forms these flat plates of gunk that fall out into the  milk and make black speckles. 
[03:56:30]  And I know that when they do the buttermilk, that's part of the byproduct also that is filtered  out and put in the buttermilk.  Yes.  Like hardened scabs in a way of gunk.  That's what makes it so salty, to tell you the truth.  It's the bovine sweat that you're getting from the cow teat.  This is starting to look like rice pudding.  Oh, good.  Enjoy it.  What, it curdles real fast?  It's getting a little clumpy.  You're going to say that about your waist later, so.  Rice pudding.  That just, it smells like curdled, like cottage cheese. 
[03:57:00]  It's a little cottage cheese that's been left out a little too long.  Enjoy your treat.  Nice, big, warm mouthful, E-Rock.  Delicious, warm mouthful.  Make sure it's nice and warm.  Yeah, treats.  It's nice to treat.  What a treat, Sam.  That's pushed away.  He's shaking.  Chew your milk, E-Rock.  Chew it.  Big, big gulp.  That's right.  Swallow that.  Oh, God.  Oh, he didn't quite make it.  Held it in the mouth too long, did you? 
[03:57:30]  Best thing to do, you know, hold your nose and swallow it and ask him to drop you off.  Oh, God damn.  Look at that garbage, pal.  Oh, it's a mess of buttermilk and sardine bones.  Hey, why don't you bite into the pickle?  Yeah, maybe the pickle will be a good treat now.  Some of the greatest treats of all time.  We haven't even touched the pickle yet.  It's like you're having dinner over Sam's house.  Yum.  This is great.  Pickles all right.  What's wrong with the pickle?  Oh, what's the matter with the pickle?  It doesn't go good with buttermilk. 
[03:58:00]  Who would think that a milk and pickle didn't go all together?  Buttermilk.  Buttermilk, yes.  Buttermilk, yes.  Nice, warm, viscous buttermilk.  More sandwich now, I think, right?  Yeah, another big bite.  I was thinking more buttermilk.  What's wrong with you, Jimmy?  Switch it up.  Switch up the order.  A nice, big gulp.  I hope it's getting warmer under these lights, too, because it's much better warm.  Then it's like a creamy custard.  It's almost like a custard. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, enjoy.  Why don't you pour some more of that?  No, I've got enough.  Oh, I don't know.  Enjoy your coagulating beverage.  E-Rog, can you chug the, just give us a nice gulp of buttermilk.  It's pre-soured.  Yeah.  Let's play rodeo with the buttermilk.  Let's see if we can keep it down.  Nice, big gulp.  That's a whole shot you got in there.  You should be able to down that entire shot.  There you go.  Come on.  If that was Jaeger, you'd be doing it.  That's right.  All right, here goes E-Rog.  Here you go. 
[03:59:00]  He's trying to chug the buttermilk.  All right.  Your beverage is clotting.  This buttermilk is not disappointing anyone.  It's forming skin.  It's horrific.  Oh, on the top?  Yeah.  Oh, no, it's not.  It's forming skin?  All right.  We all got this sardine in there.  All right.  Give us a good gulp.  Here we go, E-Rog.  Big gulp.  Some of the greatest treats of all time.  Just sipping.  Nice gulp of buttermilk.  Come on.  All the way.  All the way.  You feel the skin sliding down your tongue? 
[03:59:30]  Ew, I can smell it.  He's gagging.  Good stuff.  Oh, he poured it out.  Well, I think now you got to refill.  That's right.  He spilled it by accident.  You're spilling it.  Stop.  You're spilling it.  Well, no, he made all gone with it.  He must love it.  Fill it up again.  Yep.  Another whole big cup of creamy, warm buttermilk. 
[04:00:00]  That's a lot of buttermilk, Sam.  Oh, it's true.  You can't go for a cracker now.  You can't eat the cracker.  No, the cracker's going with the buttermilk.  Don't you know how the greatest treats of all time goes?  You're not done with the sandwich yet.  That's the reward, right?  Yes.  You don't get your dessert first.  Clean Plate Club.  Clean Plate Club.  What's the Clean Plate Club?  It's when you eat all your meals.  All right.  It's dessert.  You're a member of the Clean Plate Club. 
[04:00:30]  I bet you and your dad have fun with stuff like this.  Yeah.  It's true.  Uh-huh.  There, a nice, another big bite of his sardine.  He's making a face that says, I love it.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  How could you not, right, Ed?  It's wonderful.  Oh, wow.  I've seen crushed glass enjoy it more than he's enjoying this deal.  Sounds like the potato.  Yeah, bite into the potato again.  I want to hear the potato.  And some pickle. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah.  And then wash it all down.  With the buttermilk.  Butter, buttermilk.  Get a nice, big bite of the potato for everybody.  It sounds good on the radio.  Yeah.  E-Rock can't even really stand up straight.  No, he's shaking.  He doesn't look good.  Sam, it's official.  Your dad is a weirdo.  He actually enjoys this.  Here goes the potato.  Here goes the potato.  Raw potato. 
[04:01:30]  Doesn't it sound wet and uncooked?  It sounds awful.  But it's so inviting.  I've never been able to hear something that tastes awful.  Yeah.  That sounds terrible.  This is the best part of the meal.  It kills the taste of everything else.  Oh, good.  And you need some sandwich.  You want to wash it down with some more buttermilk?  Now you've got to wash it all down with a nice brand new cup that he's got. 
[04:02:00]  That's right.  Delicious milk butter byproduct.  Before the skin forms at the top.  Yeah.  Like when you leave pudding out.  Yeah.  It gets a skin on it and then you leave it out longer and it cracks like an earthquake.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Good stuff, righty?  Oh, yeah.  Come on, E-Rock.  All right, E-Rock.  It's like drinking out of a giant zit.  If you're just turning into E-Rock.  He just put the cup down after Jimmy's comment.  He's taking a little more time. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, it is.  Isn't it like pustule fluid?  Yeah.  That's true.  How else can we describe this?  Some kind of sample.  Yeah.  Do you ever squeeze one that just takes so long and then it finally gives and just all  over the mirror?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's do it.  Are you actually chewing the buttermilk?  Some people want to know.  You're supposed to.  Is it lumpy yet?  Not yet.  This buttermilk.  Roll that around in your mouth.  The buttermilk really changes form pretty quickly.  Yeah.  If you're just turning into E-Rock, he's enjoying some of the greatest treats of all time, according 
[04:03:00]  to Sam's dad.  Yes.  This is amazing because he really doesn't like this.  Well, the buttermilk.  Wow.  Look at that.  It's a big, nice, full cup again.  No, no.  That's okay.  I've seen it.  You can do it.  All right.  It's clobby.  Don't go with a little dabble, do you, either?  We're looking for a nice, big mouthful.  Wait.  Can we have him do a little in his mouth?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little swish it around.  Yeah, yeah, sometimes you use the drink that you're washing down everything with to kind 
[04:03:30]  of cleanse your teeth and your palate and your tongue.  Swish it around.  Why don't you swish it out around your mouth a little bit?  Yeah, you should, E-Rock.  Steve and S. from Bayshore are usually good with the lines.  He's just writing today, E-Rock effing rules.  Yeah.  No jokes, just saying E-Rock effing rules.  Yeah, swish it around your mouth.  Go ahead.  Before you wash out your mouth.  Looks like he's drinking a tumor.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no.  Now, swallow that delicious stick. 
[04:04:00]  It came out.  He can't drink it.  Oh, he can't do it.  How is this a treat in your house, Sam?  There's a man vomiting from drinking it.  This is supposed to be a treat.  E-Rock, why don't you bite into the potato because that's the only thing that helps you out.  How about some pickle?  I think that would be helpful, too.  Yeah, get that pickle.  How about a combo?  A little bite of the pickle and a nice big bite of the raw potato. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  Is it an acquired taste?  I don't understand.  It's one of the great treats of all time.  Yeah.  We figured that out.  I say you enjoy some pickle without the potato first.  I don't like the way you're trying to kill the pickle taste.  I know.  That's cheating and it bothers me.  Get that pickle.  All right.  You're wasting.  He seemed to like the pickle last time.  Sure he does.  Especially right after the buttermilk.  Ah, the pickle has got to be very inviting at this point.  He's angry.  What's wrong? 
[04:05:00]  His face looks angry.  Now you don't like the pickle anymore?  Why do you have such an angry face?  I have no taste buds left.  This is burning.  He looks like Little Steven on The Sopranos.  He's making that.  Yes, still.  Yeah, thank you.  I can remember his character name.  And a big.  There he goes.  Heating a granite countertop. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, E-Rock.  We're taking.  Ant's taking a video with his flip.  Oh, yeah.  I'll put some of this up on my Facebook later.  And I've been sending pictures out to all the followers on Twitter.  OP Radio on Twitter.  I'm sending pictures out as E-Rock enjoys the greatest treats of all time.  Or some of.  Some of.  Of all time.  Yeah.  I want to know in time what some of the other treats are.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Not today, though.  Oh, no.  That would be crazy.  No, we're concentrating on the wonderfulness of the buttermilk.  Around the holidays, your father will enjoy a gravel driveway. 
[04:06:00]  Did he eat enough of the sardine sandwich?  Only half.  No, only half.  Oh, well.  He's got to finish that up.  What do you want to do, E-Rock?  People starving.  We're heading toward a break, but what do you want to do?  I want to die is what I want to do.  More sardine.  All right.  How about one big?  How about the grand finale?  Let's go with a...  How do you want to do this, Ant?  One big bite of the sardine sandwich.  Yeah.  Throw in the buttermilk and bite down on the potato all at the same time. 
[04:06:30]  Pickle, pickle, pickle.  Pickle, potato.  All right.  He loves that potato.  This is the grand finale.  You know how you see fireworks and you're like, ooh, and then it's finally, you know,  the big...  The ending?  Yeah.  Big bite of the sardine onion sandwich.  How do you want to do this?  Bite into the potato and then drink the buttermilk all at the same time or one after another?  Yeah.  Yeah, because you want to do a each taste.  Rapid fire.  All right.  How about this?  Listen to me closely.  You got the...  A big bite of the sardine sandwich.  Bite of the potato. 
[04:07:00]  Drink the buttermilk.  Bite down on the pickle.  End of...  And swallow it.  End of enjoying the...  But one after another.  Yeah, yeah.  I want your mouth full of everything.  Sandwich, potato, pickle, milk.  All right.  No, no, no.  Sandwich, potato, buttermilk, pickle.  Oh.  Yeah.  Atta boy.  End with the pickle.  Here it is.  The grand finale.  And you got to do that until you swallow it.  If you spit it back out, you got to do it again.  Put it...  Get it all in your mouth.  Okay, here's a big bite of that sandwich.  You put it in the sandwich. 
[04:07:30]  It sounded like Don Corleone in the tomato field.  And now the potato.  Nice.  All right.  Keep going.  Don't swallow too much milk.  Big mouth full of buttermilk in there.  Big mouth full.  And don't puke until you get to the pickle.  All right.  Hold it in.  Hold it in.  Hold it in.  It's gone.  No, he's trying out.  It's gone.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[04:08:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, this poor son of a bitch.  And it's just, this isn't even like Fear Factor food.  This is something that Sam's dad eats and enjoys.  It's not just what he enjoys.  What is it, Sam?  These are some of the greatest treats the world has seen in my dad's typical Sunday lunch.  Yeah.  Like a lazy Sunday lunch.  That's what makes this so great.  I mean, we could do this, we could get the same reaction from Fear Factor crap. 
[04:08:30]  Yes.  This is regular crap.  It's the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the  show.  Amazing show.  There's a lot of stuff that was covered, and there's a lot more yet to come.  And I have been E-Rock.  Yeah.  And you have been Primetime Sam Roberts.  I know.  Both from the Opie and Anthony show.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, if you're a new subscriber or whatever, thanks for listening, checking  this out.  This is all new to you.  Yeah.  And it only gets better from here.  Yeah.  Well, tomorrow's show has a lot of good shit as well. 
[04:09:00]  That's true.  What do we got?  Well, when you think about the way 2009 has been, it wouldn't be complete without airing  some of our favorite phoners, you know, from the guests that have come on, celebrity interviews  that came.  Everyone will all be featuring it tomorrow.  Some of the most hilarious moments.  I'm calling me, Anthony.  E-Rock.  I'm Mike.  E-Rock, wake up.  Turn the mic back on or go home.  Oh.  All right.  See you later. </pre>
