<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them with frequent use of vulgar and offensive language.  The show began with a lengthy discussion about Lady Di, a frequent, now homeless caller struggling with drug and alcohol addiction.  Opie, Anthony, Patrice O'Neal (in studio), and Jim Norton (calling in) recounted Lady Di's history with the show and debated the extent of their responsibility in helping her, ultimately concluding she needed to hit rock bottom. Lady Di's friend, Marion, called in to corroborate her struggles and describe a manipulative boyfriend. The hosts also discussed listener calls concerning Lady Di, including an offer to retrieve her from near a Pathmark in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Speculation about Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson's rumored relationship was interspersed throughout.  A comedic segment featuring a song by their homeless friend, Grey Wolf, and banter about Steve, a friend obsessed with extreme weight loss methods, including a potentially dangerous supplement, were also included.

The discussion then shifted to Steve, a caller focused on extreme weight loss, leading to a sexually charged and racially charged conversation about his wife's attractiveness among the hosts and Patrice O'Neal. This evolved into a broader discussion about racial dynamics and anxieties in interracial communication.  A significant portion involved vulgar and offensive descriptions of various sexual acts.

The show also discussed a viral video of Twitchels, a person with Tourette's Syndrome, self-harming and the hostsâ€™ involvement in the video; a news story about a teenager involved in hazing that included explicit details of sexual acts, which prompted further discussion of sexual slang; and a lengthy segment dedicated to comparing various sports, often using offensive language and comparisons.  A rant by former baseball manager Lee Elia was played.

A humorous anecdote about a youth football game, using racially charged language, introduced a phone interview with David Koechner, who discussed his role in "Thank You for Smoking," his work with Steve Carell, and his upcoming Comedy Central show. Patrice O'Neal was present for this segment. This was followed by a discussion of a baseball player's accidentally broadcast profanity-laced commentary, leading to imagined scenarios of similarly offensive broadcasts. A complaint against the show, referencing "Web Junk 20," was also discussed.  The hosts played several audio clips: a voicemail with explicit demands for interns; audio of a DEA agent who shot himself in the foot; and clips from MTV's *Yo Mama*, with commentary on censorship.  Banter about the DEA agent's lawsuit and gun safety followed, concluding with a discussion of "Fables from the Disabled" and a bizarre accompanying visual clip.

The show briefly mentioned Sean and his book "Disabled Fables," followed by a discussion of listener-submitted audio from "Heist," featuring racially charged dialogue between police officers. The hosts analyzed the audio using racial slurs and offensive remarks, comparing it to other shows like "The Cosby Show," "Seinfeld," and "Cheers," with further offensive commentary about Bill Cosby.  Multiple calls ensued, including one from Lady Di, resulting in confrontational and offensive exchanges.  A listener submitted a Playboy magazine featuring Thelma from "Good Times," leading to more commentary about the show.  Another caller pointed out the small age difference between the actors playing the father and J.J. on "Good Times." The segment concluded with a discussion of a fatal tree falling on deaf Italian tourists and an anecdote about Opie's childhood.  "O&A Party Rock" merchandise was mentioned.

The show ended with a news story about a tree falling on deaf Italian tourists, which transitioned into rambling, nonsensical, and profane conversation, including references to Italians and an unintelligible phrase involving "ninyin."  Patrice O'Neal's recent appearances and a Boston show at Bill's Bar on Marathon Monday were promoted, with Patrice O'Neal present in studio.  The final moments included a discussion of a man charged with public masturbation who claimed to lack a penis.

[00:04:00]  We love when Hawk fucks up. 
[00:04:30]  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. We can freeze his head.  It's Friday! 
[00:05:00]  It's Friday!  It's Friday!  It's Friday!  He can't do it on the road, I can't do it.  You smoke crack, don't you?  You smoke crack, don't you? 
[00:05:30]  You smoke crack, don't you?  Look at me, boy.  Don't you smoke crack.  Look, my vagina is too fat,  but these teeth are very small  and they don't damage very much.  They just, they pinch.  Contrary to popular opinion,  I'm the head-tigger in charge.  Go ahead, go on, leave.  Leave our father.  He stinks, and I don't like it. 
[00:06:00]  Wonderful.  And that's how we begin another O.P. and Anthony broadcast.  Friday, right?  It's Friday, yes.  Trying to get my mic, uh, headphone ratio adjusted. 
[00:06:30]  I think it's okay.  I think we're the only talk show that is live today.  Really?  It's Good Friday.  It's Good Friday.  The stock markets are closed.  That's all I know.  I don't know about anything else.  Banks?  Are the banks open?  Close.  Anybody?  Anybody?  Anybody?  Banks?  Banking institutions?  Good Friday?  Yeah.  I don't think Good Friday's out there.  But the stock market's closed.  Yeah, it must be a ghost piece of shit.  Yeah, those motherfuckers are. 
[00:07:00]  Anything?  Dwayne Reed?  Are they open?  Close?  Oh, no.  Open.  Nuclear attack.  Those places are open.  Doesn't matter.  Come on in.  You need cough medicine.  They don't care.  Who knows?  Let's just run through this shit.  Heathens, let's just run through this shit one more time and then go home for the weekend.  Plaster a smile on our face and plow through this shit one more time before the weekend starts.  Hi, how are you this morning?  Let's make believe we give a crap.  This fine, fine Friday. 
[00:07:30]  Where?  Right in.  Yeah, I was looking at that.  Wait, let me see.  Looked like Opie got.  Ken Paves.  You see that?  Like Opie and a chick walking out of an Outback Steakhouse.  You saw that?  Yeah.  I thought the same thing.  I thought that's how it would look if Opie and I was caught walking out of a place by the press.  I was about to say, damn.  That's Jessica Simpson.  That guy's next to Jessica Simpson.  You banging Jessica Simpson?  I'm not banging Jessica Simpson.  Dane Cook is.  Dane Cook is. 
[00:08:00]  That's what the rumor is.  That's what the rumor is around the circles.  Don't yell out a nigga's pussy like that?  No, it's funny.  No, it's funny about that rumor.  Dane Cook is, you know, a friend of pretty much everybody's.  We've known Dane Cook for many, many years.  Yeah.  And he's blowing up.  Everyone knows it.  And he's now doing a movie with Jessica Simpson.  What is he?  He's beyond blowing up.  What does he have to give Satan?  Like, I don't know his exact deal.  I haven't seen the contract.  But obviously he gets a few years of anything he wants. 
[00:08:30]  And then it comes.  What is it?  I don't know.  Look it.  And I love Dane.  A lot of white boys hate Dane.  Like, in the comedy community.  Yeah.  They're just jealous.  He doesn't bother.  Because Dane's righteous.  A lot of motherfuckers try to copy Dane.  Yeah.  This motherfucker.  I've never heard of him if I didn't know him.  Yeah.  Like, you know, his motherfuckers fame will go through your ears.  And you go, okay, I've never heard of Dane.  And he's selling out arenas.  Oh, yeah.  Not.  Yeah, we're going to see him tomorrow night when we go up to Boston. 
[00:09:00]  Are you going?  Yeah, I'm going to a show.  Fucking the Fleet Center.  He sold out the Fleet Center in Boston.  Oh, is that where you're going to?  What, a Boston.  The Fleet Center, whatever they call it now.  It's the Fleet Center.  I think he sold out a couple shows up there, right?  Three or some shit.  Three sold out shows at the Fleet Center.  The guy is as big as you can get in comedy.  I couldn't sell out the Stardome in Alabama.  And they got nothing to do.  Fucking U2 does.  They go in there and sell out.  That's where U2 plays, yeah.  Yeah.  Dane can sell out one of those parks.  Yeah.  He can do a park gig like fucking Prodigy. 
[00:09:30]  What the?  Well, but the point I'm making now, you know, he's blown up and he's doing an HBO special  or something up in Boston.  Yeah.  He's taping it at the Fleet Center.  A lot of us are going, doing a movie with Jessica Simpson.  Now all the rag magazines are saying, you know, is he banging Jessica Simpson?  Yeah.  That seems to be the idea.  I would bet money he wasn't.  Well, this is the point I want to make.  He's not running to the press to say, I'm not banging Jessica Simpson.  That's true.  Well, he's a smart, that's a smart thing to do.  Some of those rumors, you can't wait to get in front of a microphone and go, wait a minute, 
[00:10:00]  dude.  He's like, hold on.  He's like, hello?  Hi, hi, Dane.  This is Jessica.  You think you can tell people that we're not fucking?  Oh.  You probably call a dude, too.  Ah, dude.  No, dude, you got to keep that going.  Whether you're doing it or not.  Look, I don't want to know.  But you can't say no.  Dane probably thinks he's upgrading her pussy.  Yeah.  You should say you're fucking me, dude.  Well, Dane's got a girlfriend and everything, but he's not running to the press to deny that.  Let that rumor. 
[00:10:30]  Let that rumor fly.  How do you keep the girlfriend in check or explain to the girlfriend, look, it's the press, it's this.  I'm not going to get up.  You go on there and you deny it.  I want you to bring me out there and you show us together and don't just, baby, I really can't do that.  People have to think I'm fucking Jessica Simpson.  Shut up and get back in your trunk.  I got Dane Cook's response.  All right.  He's just going to sit there and he'll nod his head a lot. 
[00:11:00]  I don't think he is, man.  He's too professional.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He wouldn't cheat on his girl.  That's how I feel about it.  Yeah.  He wouldn't get no side pussy.  Is it cheating when everyone knows about it?  Like if it's in the press.  It's called iszing.  Iszing, right.  It's just like the whole thing to cheating is you're trying to pull the wool over someone's eyes and get away with something.  You're cheating.  If you're doing, you're doing is you're iszing.  You're iszing. 
[00:11:30]  I'm cheating.  I'm iszing.  Yeah.  I'm iszing, motherfucker.  Mr. O'Neill, are you looking at that Chinese boy's paper?  Are you looking at his test?  Why, yes, I am.  I'm iszing.  I'm iszing.  I'm iszing looking at this motherfucker's paper.  You know that's cheating?  No, it's iszing.  I don't deny it.  So, there you have it.  Hey, let's go to Brad in Buffalo.  Brad, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Come on, Brad.  We're off to a good start.  Let's go.  So, why don't you just reach into the cash register, Brad, and give me my money back. 
[00:12:00]  It's not the best breakfast I ever had.  Lady Di yesterday.  Your timing stinks, Brad.  You have no rhythm.  Lady Di, I don't know.  What is going on with Lady Di?  Is that what he said?  Because he was saying it over what you were saying.  And he continued to talk as I talked.  Yeah, you talked.  So, I have no idea what the hell is going on.  People have to be aware.  This is how a conversation goes.  You have to be aware on this program.  It's not like other radio shows.  Y'all are ornery already.  It's fucking just on.  The whole guy was trying to mumble out his horse shit. 
[00:12:30]  And you guys, he took him right off of his fucking...  You've got to listen a little bit.  That's all we're saying.  In four seconds, the guy's like,  You motherfucker!  Hurry up, Buffalo!  We believe Brad has something good to say.  This is a weird show.  I think he was concerned about Lady Di.  Yeah.  All right, Brad.  The floor is yours.  I'm sorry.  All right.  I'm just wondering what ended up happening with Lady Di yesterday. 
[00:13:00]  Conversation cut off at the end of the show.  It was kind of weird because...  Cut off.  The show ended yesterday and a lot of comments going,  Ah, she sounds really fucked up this time.  Really?  She sounds fucked up.  Oh, well.  Well, I'll see you in an hour, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  I really could care less.  But I don't know.  Maybe she'll call back today and we'll really get into it finally.  A lot of important things going on.  You know, we've been trying to help her for years.  And, you know, what are you going to do after a while?  What are you going to do?  And honestly, we did try to help.  We really tried to help get her off the juice, the sauce. 
[00:13:30]  Brought our friends in on the whole thing.  When is time to give up on someone?  On somebody, when they give you a call like that on the show and go,  I'm homeless.  I'm on the street.  And we told her that's exactly what was going to happen.  Then you just give up.  Wait, so when this thing happens that you warn the person about happening,  when that actually happens, then you say, fuck you?  Yeah, because they've hit bottom.  It depends how much you care for somebody.  Yeah, we really don't care about it. 
[00:14:00]  To tell you the truth.  You know what?  You can't be mad at what you just said.  It's like, you know, any human being out there that felt bad for her,  after you hear that kind of honesty where you go, you know,  I'm going to be honest with you.  I cannot.  You ever watch the news and just go, boy, oh boy, I want to give a fuck about this.  I really want to.  Because I'm supposed to.  Yeah.  But I just don't.  And you know what?  That was a very fair statement, Opie.  I go with that.  You know, I felt a little bad for her.  And the fun you guys were having with her.  She's like, I'm homeless, help.  All right, let me ask you a question, Patrice. 
[00:14:30]  You felt bad and it was very obvious because you were looking at us like,  you know, brand new listeners to this show are going to hate you guys  because of what you just did.  Yes.  And that's okay because they'll come back and listen again.  But you were the one.  Just to hate you.  You were the one that said that you were really bothered by that, right?  Not super duper bothered, but I was like, wow.  When did it leave your mind?  As soon as I left.  You know what?  All right.  As soon as I left.  I ain't going to lie to you.  As soon as you hit the bright streets of Manhattan, 
[00:15:00]  were you still thinking of Lady Di and her plight?  Absolutely not.  I can't lie to you.  Absolutely not.  To be honest, I forgot all about it.  I forgot that she even called the show yesterday  until that guy, Brad from Buffalo, reminded me.  Yeah.  I'm here to say that Opie is not as big of an asshole as you think  because I saw a moment yesterday.  I'm not going to even say it.  I'm not going to share it.  I saw a little moment.  You saw a moment?  Yeah.  I saw a moment of like Greg Hughes moment.  Oh, it wasn't Opie?  It was Greg Hughes.  It was a Greg Hughes moment.  Wow.  And I saw it.  Really? 
[00:15:30]  Fucking yes, I did.  You've piqued my interest.  I fucking saw it.  Was it on the show?  You know what Greg Hughes did?  What?  Greg Hughes comes out and goes,  She really homeless?  Oh.  Greg Hughes was concerned.  That was it?  She really homeless?  Yeah.  That was a Greg Hughes moment.  And I think somebody smacked him in his face and said,  Snap out of it, Opie.  Fuck that bitch.  Yeah, right?  You know what?  Who cares?  Where's my rollerblade?  It's like a rollerblade over this homeless hoe.  And then I went, hmm, well, do you want to get some meat? 
[00:16:00]  You hungry?  You hungry?  That's his thing.  And she went out of his mind.  You hungry?  You know, we got someone that's calling in right now, Jim from Brooklyn.  Jim was trying to help Lady Di.  Oh, Jim was, Jim, you wanted to get her an AA and all that, right?  Yeah, I was trying to get her into the program.  And you know what?  Sorry about that, guys.  You know what?  She got what she deserves, whether she wants to say so or not.  You guys called it. 
[00:16:30]  I called it.  It was like, Di, you're going to get yourself homeless.  You're going to get fucked.  And, you know, well, she did it.  Here's what happened, the whole lead-up to this thing with Lady Di.  Lady Di was on the show years ago on our N.E.W. show.  We called her, she was part of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  They had been friends, her, Diana, and Marion, had been friends for years, since high school.  And they would come in because they would just babble incessantly with each other. 
[00:17:00]  And it was annoying, but there was something funny about it.  But then, when we got the boot, we come back to XM two years after we got the boot.  And we figured we'd have them back on the show.  We didn't have any new characters, so we bring on the old characters to see what they've been up to.  We slowly saw Lady Di's life just going away.  She's losing her job, losing her kid.  You know, little by little, she's lying about getting jobs and things like that. 
[00:17:30]  And we told her, look, if you don't clean up your shit, and she was constantly drunk, you don't clean up your act, you're going to end up on the streets.  Just a homeless...  Hadn't she lost a kid on the old show?  I think she had lost a kid.  Yeah, toward the end of the old show, she had started, like, this little slide.  But, you know, on the new show here, she has just fallen apart.  And now she's hit rock bottom.  There's really nothing you can do for somebody once they've bottomed out like that. 
[00:18:00]  They have to really see that they've bottomed out.  And we saw her try to pull out.  She came into the studio a couple times, and she is pretty much pickled at this point.  Yeah.  Her color's not right.  Oh, my God.  She's pickled.  Pickled.  No, I'm not even kidding.  Our color is not right.  It's not right.  I don't think she's even hit it yet, because she's still sitting there.  Yesterday, she was sitting there going, oh, no, that's not true.  Yeah, she's still lying.  No, that's not.  I'm not drinking.  I'm not doing.  And then she's, you know, looking to get donations from Whack Bag, who gave money to Patty. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  And Pat from Unaki.  Well, Jim was a good guy, man.  He came out of the woodwork to just say, look, you know, I want to help this woman.  What would be funny would be if you did do a donation on Whack Bag, you'd probably end  up owing Whack Bag $2,000.  There you go.  Hey, Jim, Marion's on the phone, so we've got to say goodbye for now.  All right.  Later, boys.  Lady Di's best friend, Marion. 
[00:19:00]  Marion.  Yeah, hi.  How you doing?  All right.  So Lady Di called us yesterday out of desperation, begging us to help her.  She said that she's homeless.  What's the story?  Back in January, she went into rehab.  Um, they gave her medication to take, you know, to get off the alcohol.  She couldn't handle it.  And she just wanted out.  She went a little nutsy at the end of, you know, at the end of the 28-day program that  she was supposed to go through.  She decided she's hanging out with this guy who, this guy has been in and out of jail. 
[00:19:30]  He's a real ass.  She is really toppled.  I mean, she got hooked up with this guy when she was staying at the Salvation Army.  And I told her, back in, around Christmas time, get help.  You look horrible.  You look like crap.  You know, they fired her at Dunkin' Donuts.  That's coming from memory.  You know, she's...  They fired her from Dunkin' Donuts?  They fired her because she went to work one day drunk.  Yeah.  But she's not an alcoholic, though, right? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, right.  And I told her to go into this place that they help you, St. Joe's.  It's the organization in Elizabeth.  And I made some phone calls.  And they said, if she goes to the hospital, they'll put her in.  She...  What happened is, one day at work, I got a phone call that she was in the hospital.  So she...  She was on the phone with me.  And I said, what happened?  The night before, she got mugged panhandling.  So she went in.  She was panhandling and gotten mugged. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, she was panhandling and somebody beat her up.  This story gets better and better.  And they took her cell phone from her.  They took a lot of things from her.  So I said, well, this is the life you want to be.  What are you doing?  Why didn't you stop it?  No.  I can just see the scene.  Seriously, I said, so this is what you want?  This is the life of a homeless person.  This is the life.  This is what you want?  I said, what are you going to do?  She says, well, I think it's time for me to get help.  So right after Christmas is when she went to that 28-day program that this organization 
[00:21:00]  was helping her.  I kept in touch with the counselor.  Every now and then, I'd call her from work.  And she would tell me, Diane's doing okay.  Diane's doing okay.  Diane would call me like once a week to let me know if she's doing all right.  At the end, I figured beginning of February, she started to tell me about this medication  that they give you to wean you off the alcohol.  I know all about it, right?  I said, well, take it.  She was taking something else, too, for her anxiety. 
[00:21:30]  I said, this is to help you.  I said, take it.  I said, stop being nervous.  Stop worrying about this, how you feel.  If it's too strong, ask for something else, right?  So two weeks later, I get a phone call, right?  She says to me, Marion, I couldn't handle it anymore.  I'm out.  I said, what do you mean you're out?  She says, they found something.  They give you a blood test, I guess, every week or whatever.  And I said, what do you mean?  Boring. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  I said, what do you mean they found something?  They found benzoids in her blood, which wasn't connected with the medication.  I said, what the fuck are you doing?  Oh, nothing, nothing.  Nobody gave me nothing.  I says, look.  All right.  I have my own problems, right?  I said, you know what?  You're fucked up.  I said, you want help, but yet you couldn't handle the medication.  I said, what the fuck are you doing?  She says, well, I decided I had enough.  I want out.  Okay.  They kicked away the program.  They don't give her another chance. 
[00:22:30]  This is like, I don't know how many chances that they're supposed to give you.  But how does, how counselor said to me that this was it.  This was the third or fourth or fifth, whatever.  She decided this is the life she wants to leave.  So she doesn't call me.  We don't really talk as much anymore.  So I, I heard from her like about three weeks ago, right?  I found that, that she decided she liked this guy that she's hanging with so much that this guy leaves her.  Believe me, this guy fucking leaves her at train station in Elizabeth behind Pathmark. 
[00:23:00]  She's sleeping with all of these fucking homeless people.  Yes.  I, I talked to her two weeks ago, right?  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  No, I got home from work yesterday.  You, these guys called me.  I appreciate these guys calling, but I don't, her father can't fucking help her.  So what the fuck am I supposed to do?  Yeah.  I got my own problems too, right?  I, I, I, well, Marion, uh, I don't understand how someone, how someone's life falls apart so late in life. 
[00:23:30]  Let me tell you, she's in her late forties.  Yeah.  So what?  What does that mean?  She can't go and decide, she decided she wants to be with this guy.  She likes this guy a lot.  She likes this guy better than anybody else, better than any of her friends, including me,  including a lot of her other friends that we sang with.  She'd rather hang out with these homeless people.  And, and, and, and Gemma, I found that yesterday. 
[00:24:00]  Matter of fact, I talked to somebody yesterday.  She got a lot of her clothes stolen.  Well, that's what happens to the homeless.  Because she's just what these, that's what these homeless people do.  The good news, she can be part of our homeless shopping spree.  That's right.  Uh, next Christmas.  Oh my God.  So what did she say to you guys when she called you?  Uh, that she's homeless, she needs help, and she wants us to raise money for her.  She was trying to solicit money off a whack bag.  But it would just go to either a drugs or her stupid, uh, uh, drug addict boyfriend or booze. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  She wouldn't do the right thing with it.  So you think whack bags are going to come up with, uh, money for her?  No way.  She's looking for money to, uh, to drink.  Because I helped her out so much.  I, I put money on her phone for her like a few months ago.  I helped her too fucking much.  I told, no, I don't give a shit about her.  I don't hang with her.  She calls me every couple of weeks.  I had enough.  I had to deal with my own problems 20 fucking years ago.  You think I'm going to deal with this again?  I said to her, no, I told her two weeks ago. 
[00:25:00]  I said, this is what you like.  She doesn't seem to get the fucking picture.  I told her she's going to end up dead.  These people are going to knock the shit out.  She can't fight.  Diane can't fight for herself.  I know.  I know for too damn long.  Yeah, she's just a big, overweight water buffalo with the lions around and the crocodiles.  Well, let me tell you something.  I have not seen her since November.  But from what I heard, she's like a lot of weight.  Her hair is always, of course, homeless. 
[00:25:30]  You can't take a shower.  You can't take, you know what I mean?  What do you can do?  But I heard she looks so much, oh, forget it.  I heard she looks horrible.  Now I want her to come in.  And now I need to see a picture of her.  Now I want to see her.  Now we need her to call back.  I don't know.  She ain't going to call, what, on her fucking satellite radio tape to her head?  She'll call us again today.  I guarantee that.  I don't know where she's at.  I mean, all I know is that this is what she's doing.  When this guy leaves her, this guy, like, dumps her on the street every couple days.  And this guy has a place to stay.  He stays with his mother.  He stays with friends. 
[00:26:00]  But he doesn't seem to give a shit.  You know?  Yang dumpster dive.  But yet, she will go find him no matter where he is.  She will go friggin' find him.  Because she, this is what she wants.  She likes this guy.  This guy treats her like, I mean, me and this guy had a fight.  Me and this guy had a fight back in January, the way he treats her.  But you know what?  He controls her.  He tells Diane, jump.  She says, how fucking high.  So this is it. 
[00:26:30]  In front of a train, perhaps.  I mean, you know, I, like I said, I don't give a shit.  We got it.  Her father, her father's fed up.  It seems like everyone's fed up.  There's only so much you can do.  Tell me about it.  And you know something?  I got, I'm gonna tell you, I got my shit together.  And I'm doing pretty good.  And I keep telling her, if I could do it and a lot of other people that we know  who's been down in the dumps could do it, she can do it.  There's people like this in your life that just drag you down in the end.  I mean, she's hard.  You have an obligation to help them out because you're related to them or they're your friends. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then you realize, now this has affected me.  Yeah.  Now this is fucking up my life.  And if she's calling you, what does she expect you to fucking do?  Run a telethon or something for her?  And we're not stupid.  What is that gonna actually do?  What does she expect?  She needs to go into rehab and go look for her?  I mean, you know, there's so many people that, you know, so much help here.  The government gives you, I mean, she's on food stamps.  She's on welfare. 
[00:27:30]  You know, these people are helping her.  But yet, she doesn't want to go back into a hospital.  She could tell you.  I mean, she might have told you that she's on her way on the list to go back into rehab.  That's all bullshit.  Of course it is.  Because let me tell you, she could go right back over to St. Joe's.  Not today, because there's a holiday.  She could go right back over to St. Joe's on Monday.  Oh, my God.  The talking.  And they may take her back.  Hold on, man.  Take a breath.  Let's say hi to Blind Dave.  Blind Dave.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Blind Dave.  Hey, Dave.  How are you?  All I got to say to the whack baggers is, Jules, if you give this Nimrod $1,500, I'll shoot 
[00:28:00]  him on general principle.  I would take that chance, though, because it's Blind Dave.  You know, the government helps scumbags like her more than they do the disabled and the elderly.  Yeah.  Yeah, she just, we've told her.  At the beginning, when she just started sliding, everyone saw it.  It's amazing how far down the toilet she went. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, my God.  She was the one that ended up completely in the shitter.  I would think more of her for accomplishing something if she killed herself.  And she still doesn't believe it.  The tall road of denial is a long one.  Right?  Hey, Dave, you're going to be at our broadcast on Monday.  I'm probably not going to be able to make it.  We're going to be in Boston, man.  Bill's Bar and Lansdowne Street.  Marathon Monday.  And I think we're doing the show from 8 to 11. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  That's early, no?  I'm going to try and make it.  What time does the marathon actually start?  I don't know.  Sometime in the morning.  Yeah?  It's a weird time for the show, so don't forget.  Monday.  My band's playing Saturday night at the Mammoth Road Club in Drake It, and you can find out directions on Pulserox.net.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Later.  So, Marion.  Yeah?  Well, I guess we'll have to wait and see if she calls the show today.  I don't know.  She'll probably call.  What's she calling you? 
[00:29:30]  Someone pay phone?  I guess.  Oh, because I have.  Like I said, she has no money.  She has no minutes on her phone or not.  I don't help her no more.  Right.  All right.  We'll see what happens today.  If she does, try to call me back later on.  I will.  Thanks, Marion.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Take care.  There's the lady, Di Update.  A lot of people were asking, so a lot worse than we thought.  She hooked up with some bad element.  Jesus.  And wow.  Fucking homeless guy.  Bottom of the barrel.  Homeless now.  Now she's living behind a supermarket somewhere. 
[00:30:00]  Jersey.  Not even a New York homeless.  Yeah.  A Jersey homeless.  Oh, man.  Which makes you a lesser homeless.  She's Jersey homeless.  New York homeless is like...  New York's the number one market for homeless, I think.  Like if you reach New York, you're homeless, but you're New York City homeless.  Like just think of like a, I don't know, a Minneapolis homeless.  But a homeless Jersey person has a better view.  They can see the skyline and everything. 
[00:30:30]  They're just looking up and seeing the buildings like they're eating you.  You got it all wrong with the homeless thing.  I do?  The further south you go, the better off you are homeless.  Oh, no.  I understand the better off you are.  Like if you're going to be homeless, why would you pick Minneapolis?  Why would you pick New York?  Why pick a cold place?  Go to Florida.  Go to Florida.  You know why, though?  But New York, you're going to be able to get the panhandling down a little better.  And if you make it in...  More people.  If you make it homeless in New York, you can make it anywhere.  Make it anywhere.  It's up to you.  You bum. 
[00:31:00]  You bum.  You bum.  You bum.  Hey, uh...  Start spreading out the newspapers.  You're going to sleep tonight.  Let's go to Flying Standby.  Flying Standby.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  I don't want to kill the flow of the show, but I got to point out one of Opie's lines that  had me laughing.  They got no love.  Oh, all right.  You know, I don't get to call as much because of my job, but I got to call one of these  out.  Basically, when Blind Dave called with the Jules line, Opie goes, well, I'd take that chance 
[00:31:30]  that it's Blind Dave, you know, with a gun.  Fucking had me hysteric.  He is blind.  All right.  Punch it out, boys.  Have a good day.  I thought I should have got something out of that.  A little something.  Just a little bit.  All right.  We should regroup, because that's just...  That's just downright sad.  Ragic.  I think I see a glistening look of Karen in Mr. Opie's face.  God, there's such no Karen.  I think I'm airing here.  No, it's...  I think I saw some...  Oh, just some...  I'm fascinated.  It's a fly.  I'm sorry.  I thought it was...  I'll be absolutely... 
[00:32:00]  I thought it was a tear.  I'll be absolutely honest with you about my feelings on the Lady Di situation up to  right now, what I know, and everything.  I am fascinated with it and want to see her.  I want to see what she looks like in this devastated state.  I have no care whatsoever about her.  None.  But you didn't to begin with, right?  Let's say a family member.  How far would you let a family member go?  Let me think. 
[00:32:30]  Family member, you got to get in there.  Really, like...  You got to get in there and fight it to the end.  Yeah.  I haven't spoken to my sister.  I haven't spoken to her.  No?  About six years, maybe.  I haven't even spoke to your own sister in six years.  I can't understand that.  Long story, but it's just you go to a place...  After a while, you just got to give up.  Like, I call it like Halloween, you know?  It's like, you ever see Halloween when Donald Pleasence was like...  Oh, I thought you'd call her every Halloween.  I'm like, that's your relationship.  No, just like, it was like something where every Halloween... 
[00:33:00]  Not every Halloween, but when Donald Pleasence on Halloween, he just goes,  you know, I got this little boy and I looked at his eyes and then I just realized...  Yeah, yeah.  It's something wrong.  I know something's wrong with my sister.  Yeah.  And you're not going to change that, right?  And I just...  And, you know, you're just not going to change it.  And you have to go, you know, I love you, but what else can I do?  Yeah.  I've done all the talking, like you said.  So, I do have a sort of insight on what you're saying.  If you do care, especially if you don't care about somebody, like Lady Di, she's kind of... 
[00:33:30]  You're kind of imbeveling.  Yeah.  Anyway, but when you do care about somebody and you just see them go to a certain place  that you go, wow, what the fuck, man?  Patrice, you speak the truth.  It's very freeing when you finally realize you've done all you can do.  It's freeing.  It's still sad because it's someone that you're related to.  It's family.  Family, you get this weird fucking rule you have to do.  But it's also freeing where you go, okay, I know I've done everything I can. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  I did, man.  I talk to her and they talk, hey, you know, come on.  What are you going to do, man?  Just come on.  You're my sister.  Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.  And they get that look of looking at you.  Just looking.  But it's...  In one ear, out the other.  It's not even in the ear.  No, nothing.  It's a distant world going on in their head and you just go, oh, my God.  But I'm related to somebody that's not well.  This isn't even penetrating. 
[00:34:30]  It's not even an opinion.  Just a blank.  Oh, wow.  Like, you're going to be looking and I go, did you hear what I just said?  And she go, huh?  I go, oh, shit.  Oh, boy.  And I would try to tell my mother, but, you know, you can't tell a parent that their kid  is whatever.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's like why Michael Jackson, everybody's still...  His family's still with him knowing that he's fucking insane.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, Tom Cruise says vitamins and exercise.  That's it.  That's all you need.  Mac cures everybody.  Cures everything.  Hey. 
[00:35:00]  Mike in New York City.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's up, Mike?  Nothing.  If you want, I'll go out to Jersey to whatever supermarket she's at.  Go pick her up and bring her into the studio.  Yeah, what supermarket was it?  He says he'll do that because he wants to meet us.  That's fine.  All right.  You know what?  We could...  What supermarket was it?  Pathmark.  Pathmark where?  Elizabeth?  Somewhere around that area.  In New Jersey?  It was Pathmark in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  She's behind there with some homeless people.  Be careful.  She's behind a Pathmark fucking homeless man. 
[00:35:30]  In Elizabeth, New Jersey.  And there's a homeless guy who...  Like, how does she get more attracted to which...  Like, what's prestige for the homeless dude?  Like, you know, whatever.  Man, I will suck your dick.  You think she's a looker in the homeless community?  I bet you she's a fucking hot bra.  You think she's like a supermodel?  I bet she's delicious.  On the Pathmark on tour?  She's new homeless.  Hey, Mike.  Which is good.  She hasn't been, you know, that too much stank on her. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, Mike, come on and get out there by like 8.15.  Fresh meat.  All right, here's the deal.  Bring us Lady Di.  Bring us Lady Di.  If you can't bring her whole thing, just her head.  Chris in Albany.  Chris?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to let everybody know the way Marianne described it.  If anybody wants to go get her or screw with her, she should be right by the North Elizabeth  train station, like a half mile off of 1 and 9.  Yeah?  Yeah, there's a supermarket right behind her.  All right, try to find Lady Di.  We got to talk to her today. 
[00:36:30]  North Elizabeth train station.  And that's her spot.  That's her spot.  That's where she resides.  Well, I guess it's good food.  Supermarket garbage?  Like, supermarket garbage.  A lot of old, like, brews fruit.  Brews fruit.  Right.  Lettuce leaves.  Things like that.  She could lose some weight.  Asparagus tips.  I mean, it's good.  The occasional.  Imagine what a treat the occasional, like, open, dented box of donuts is.  It's a vegan paradise down there. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Clean your system out beautifully.  Some old Metamucil.  Let's take a break.  Is this Greg?  Greg, are you all right?  I want to laugh today.  Gregory?  I want to laugh today.  Very funny.  He gets mad if he's not funny for 30 seconds.  Absolutely.  This is a goddamn comedy show.  We get serious every once in a while when you feel like spilling out your heart.  Let's try to keep it funny. 
[00:37:30]  I don't try to victimize myself.  I just tell a story.  I was like, no, no.  Here comes 45 minutes on Patrice's sister.  It's going to make us all cry again.  Just, you know, you just realize it.  It is what it is.  You just realize it.  It is what it is.  What we should do is we should play Grey Wolf's song for Lady Di.  Jesus Christ.  Because she's out there somewhere.  Now I'm going to cry.  She's out there somewhere.  Get her a guitar.  And Grey Wolf, our homeless friend, wrote a little ditty.  You're on the path to Mark. 
[00:38:00]  You want to hear Grey Wolf as we go to break?  A quick break.  And the cops said, hey, bitch, you're fat.  Hey, bitch, put those little donuts down.  Why don't you shut up with your babbling?  We had to give up on Grey Wolf, too.  We were trying to make this song a hit.  We brought him into a studio to get more out of him, and it was just a disaster for Drew Boogie.  Are you serious?  Shilter me from the big black cock.  What did he do, man? 
[00:38:30]  He just can't get it done.  I didn't know that.  He was one and done, man.  He's a one-hit wonder.  The stars aligned for Grey Wolf.  Just that one day off the top of his head.  He came up with one line out.  Is he the fancy midnight runner of homeless singing?  Of homeless singing?  He couldn't get a line out.  Without it sounding like he had gargled with Drano.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Damn. 
[00:39:00]  Before Grey Wolf, when we get back, a British woman dead for three years with the TV on.  Tiger's in trouble for using the word spaz, which is just ridiculous.  How does that happen?  Man denies lewdness, claiming missing part.  His penis wasn't big enough to be accused of lewdness.  What?  Exactly.  What else?  Falling tree kills deaf Italian tourists.  It's one of those sucks to be you or unlucky lottery.  Unlucky lottery.  And other things, including teen's life ruined by teabagging. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, we were supposed to get to that yesterday.  That's why I'm trying to move along.  We have so much.  We got a peek at that awful show on MTV called Yo Mama.  Yeah.  Yo Mama.  That's bad.  And other things on the way.  But first, it's Grey Wolf.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a break.  I'm going to put it off the commission.  Thank you.  Oh, this is nice.  Oh, you're a boss. 
[00:40:00]  This is a story about a man.  And he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about tippy-toe Tommy.  Let's go.  All we go.  All we go.  All we go.  He's lazy at night.  And now you have nowhere to go. 
[00:40:30]  Our money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says,  And you know I have an angel.  And he says,  That is you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs. 
[00:41:00]  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain. 
[00:41:30]  That's just a little piece.  Opie and Anthony dance party weekend.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Comedy gone too far.  California, California.  California, res and knees.  Time will take me a release.  California, New Yorkies. 
[00:42:00]  To the free, the best of your feet.  A little taste of the brand new one from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  What's that?  Danny, California, right?  Very cool.  Those guys still doing it.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  How many songs with California in it?  They got a really cool video.  I'm not sure if it's for this song or what, but kind of mocking all the other videos that 
[00:42:30]  have been made.  Really?  Actually mocking the way.  How can I explain it?  Jesus.  All of a sudden they're doing their song as like Buddy Holly.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden it turns and they're doing the song like the glam rock bands or  the hair band.  Okay.  Then one video kind of looks like psychedelic, like the Black Sabbath.  Groovy.  I just explained that really, really bad. 
[00:43:00]  Way to sell it.  Patrice O'Neill in studio helping us out today.  Jim Norton in Hollywood.  Yes, he's out.  He taped a big thing yesterday.  I don't even know if we're allowed to talk about it.  The thing.  The thing.  I don't know if we can talk about it.  I don't think so.  Has that stopped you before?  Yeah, that's true.  Why do you respect that fucking kook's privacy?  What did he do?  He did something for the latest version of Last Comic Standing.  Oh.  Did he really?  Spilling the beans. 
[00:43:30]  Jim Norton.  Yes.  Who has never made it.  Well, they're doing some kind of like roast and he's one of the guys that roasts the contestants.  It's a good spot to be in actually.  Yeah.  Did they pick the thing already?  I have no idea.  They must be filming because they flew him out there to do a little something something.  And then Norton's going to be joining us Monday.  We are broadcasting live from Boston.  Some of the crew leaving right after the show.  Others leaving tomorrow.  Wow.  Anthony leaving Monday morning before the show probably. 
[00:44:00]  Sometime very early.  Nah.  But we'll be live from Bill's Bar in Lansdowne Street this Monday from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.  Right?  Yeah.  I try to get a room at Foxwoods on the way up.  You know, kind of break the drive up and have a little fun.  Play some Hold'em.  It's a great idea.  But, uh, god damn engines.  Build some more god damn rooms.  Build more rooms, you fuck Indians.  Nah, they don't have Hold'em over there. 
[00:44:30]  They don't have poker rooms over at Mojee.  He wants to play poker.  He wants to play poker.  Hey, uh.  No.  No.  I will bet a lot of money that this is a very new listener.  All right.  Eliana.  I'm not a new listener.  How long have you been listening?  Um, when you guys started on XM.  Oh, okay.  A year and a half?  About a dollar a month.  A year and a half?  Yeah.  I paid a dollar a month.  If it was two, I don't remember.  All right.  Then you're a year and a half listener.  Yeah.  That's cool.  So what do you got today?  Well, I know you guys want to change the subject, but I wanted to let you know that if you really 
[00:45:00]  did care about Marion, that perhaps you gave up on her at the wrong time, because addiction,  she's addicted, and it's a very difficult thing to get a hold of, and you're not going to get  better until you hit rock bottom.  Now, with that said, I don't think she has hit rock bottom.  I think it's going to go on for a while before she realizes that-  You know who should be caring for Lady Di?  Homeless rape victim is not rock bottom?  You know who should be caring for Lady Di? 
[00:45:30]  Her father, the rest of her family, and her friends.  Not two dopey shock jocks.  Hold on.  I'm not saying you guys are wrong.  Our job is to exploit her, and she's playing right into our hands.  No.  You guys have to cry.  You know how difficult this is going to be to leave this one alone?  I know.  Well, I don't think that you guys are doing the wrong thing.  I mean, it's certainly not up to me to say, but I just wanted to tell you that she's addicted,  and my God, she's not hit rock bottom yet.  We've talked to her for years. 
[00:46:00]  We watched the slide.  We tried to stop it.  She wouldn't listen.  What are we supposed to do?  Hobo cum is rock bottom.  Oh.  Yeah.  She, um-  Oh, in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  Let's see who snatches up hobo cum on Wacom.  Hobo cum.  That screen name is God.  Guy walks away with that stick with the bandana tied on the end of it over his shoulder.  Sorry, game. 
[00:46:30]  I gotta hop this next freighter out of here.  Who came up with the stick with the bandana thing, by the way?  I don't know.  All your possessions are just in that bandana.  You can't even fit an extra pair of underwear in there.  You can get a lighter in there.  What the hell's in the, uh, the old-  And she can't even-  You can't even get a shopping cart anymore.  No.  Because Pathmark puts up these, like, these metal bars-  Barriers around the parking lot.  So you can't squeeze them through.  No.  And it costs a quarter to get-  You can't even-  They can't even-  Bums can't even get a fucking cart.  They can't even get a break and get a damn- 
[00:47:00]  Nothing.  Shopping cart.  They really figured that cart thing out because-  You cannot squeeze those carts through those little bars.  Well, good news.  According to that lady, uh, she hasn't reached rock bottom, so we can exploit her a little  more.  Oh, good.  She's fine, man.  So then we can sleep at night.  She got more to go.  Yeah.  All right.  Homeless guys really figure out how to load those carts up.  I see a guy pushing a shopping cart that's, like, 20 sizes bigger than the shopping cart  with shit just hanging out the sides.  It's like a balancing act.  Because it's wood and it's-  Oh, they put, yeah, plywood and two-by-fours. 
[00:47:30]  They make a big platform out of it and load it up.  So, yeah, and you look and go, what the fuck does he possibly need that, like, a tire  off a wheelbarrow?  For no reason.  And for no reason, he just saw it and figured he'd pick it up.  It's Martini, Steve.  Yes, it is.  It's Martini, Steve.  It's Martini, Steve.  Hey, Steve.  How are you?  I'm fine, Opie.  How are you?  You guys are heading to Boston right after the show today?  Yeah, Ben and I are heading up.  Oh, man.  I'm jealous.  I want to go tonight.  Do you really?  Why not?  I might change my plans. 
[00:48:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Why not?  Steve?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What's wrong if Opie wants to go up?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's going up.  Grr.  Don't get angry.  Grr.  No.  Sorry.  Fucking phones are going off.  I had to throw them across the room.  Sorry.  How many phones do you have?  I have two phones now.  Two phones.  All right.  You're going to hang out with some hot goth girls in Kimmel Square?  I wish.  I wish.  Now, I have a lot of friends I haven't seen in Boston because I used to work in clubs up there.  You used to bounce.  Yeah.  You was a big, big bounce.  Lance Downs.  Much bigger, yeah.  Steve, he has that bouncer. 
[00:48:30]  Lou has a tough look and a handlebar mustache.  Well, he's not fat anymore.  I'm not fat anymore, so.  But he's big.  Yeah, he still has an intimidating look.  Like, if Steve was in a bar, you wouldn't fuck with him.  Well, you might because Steve's...  No, dude.  Steve, he's having trouble with his love handles.  Yeah, a lot.  I said about a sexy figure.  He's almost in shape, but he is having these deep troubles.  Yeah, but that's what happens when you lose a pile of weight and used to be effective.  Don't get defensive, sexy.  I'm not getting defensive.  That's a state of... 
[00:49:00]  You have no idea what kind of damage you just did.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you have no idea.  No, he's not.  This is a guy that wants to have a perfect body.  Working on it.  It might be genetics, though.  Why don't you just casually mention all the stuff you're doing to try to, like, get the perfect body?  He looks...  Look, I didn't know him when he was a fat guy.  Patrice.  You just sent him to a Pathmark in Elizabeth.  How many egg whites do you eat a day, first of all?  A dozen.  A dozen egg whites a day.  What kind of supplements are you doing these days? 
[00:49:30]  No supplements.  No more supplements.  You got rid of all that shit?  Yeah, what I'm doing now is I do six small meals a day, mostly protein and complex carbohydrates.  I take a pack of eight or nine vitamins three times a day.  That's basically a lot of cardio stuff to help, like, muscles regenerate, and I work out every single day.  What's the name?  Wait, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Ketosis.  Yeah, it is mostly ketosis, but it's...  What the hell is that?  Oh, fuck it.  Ketosis is when your body is constantly burning fat because you're not...  It's the principle that the Atkins and Scarsdale diets were all based on. 
[00:50:00]  Your body eats itself.  Yeah, your body eats itself.  Oh, that's great.  But you're eating so much protein that your body is never really searching for what it needs.  You should have said that he looks like he has, like, really good abs and stuff.  Because now he doesn't...  I can't lie to him, but he looks...  He's got good on.  Dude, no.  I would go, hey, Steve, man, you're looking good, but you're having trouble with the little tum-tum.  If that's the truth, what the fuck?  Oh, damn.  I'm not disrespecting the guy.  Oh, jeez.  You're not around here every day.  We've all have decided don't even talk about what's wrong with Steve. 
[00:50:30]  Steve, you play right into it.  So you motherfuckers, like, never told him...  I'm his only friend in this motherfucker.  That's bullshit.  He looks amazing compared to how he used to look.  Look how he hands and nothing.  Steve is a god.  He looks good.  But he's a little obsessed with getting it even better.  How many hours a day do you work out?  Minimum an hour and a half.  All right.  That's not too bad.  One day he's handing out shit pills to all of us.  Well, I wasn't...  Steve, who's got the shit pills? 
[00:51:00]  Everybody's shit.  Everybody's shit with the gun.  I tried him...  Dude.  Oh, the oxy powder.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the oxy powder.  Because, you know, because there's morning radio, we're eating the eggs every morning.  You get bound up when you have that much.  You're getting bound up like crazy.  Oxy powder work, right?  So this ass comes in with this shit powder, I call it, or shit pills.  I tried it.  E-Rock tried it.  Derek.  Derek tried it.  I think Danny tried it.  Half the place tried it.  This is dangerous crap. 
[00:51:30]  Without...  And somebody told me about this.  Without...  How long did it take?  It, uh...  Did that have your first very violent bowel movement to take the bowel?  Oh, very violent.  You better...  You better time when you take those pills.  You got any with you?  No, I could bring you something if you want to really.  You got a time when you take these pills.  Because if you wake up in the middle of the night a little groggy and think you might just  have to let a little gas out, you could be in some serious trouble.  Oh, yeah.  You could go, whoa!  You said, whoa! 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, there's no subtle farting when you take this stuff.  You will shit your pants if you...  Steve, I don't know what you're feeling.  Not at all.  Not at all.  It's not my context.  It wasn't like...  No.  You didn't do it on purpose, but...  No, no, you didn't even...  But you stay away from...  It's like a really...  Steve is bordering on obsessed with trying to have the perfect body for his size or whatever.  When you spend...  Very simply, when you spend 27 years or 20...  Yeah, it was 27 years for me being really fat.  And you are of the mind...  I'm 32 now.  All right.  So when you spend that long being that fucking obese and you get it into your head that you 
[00:52:30]  are never, ever going to look any other way.  And all of a sudden, something happens.  In my case, it was surgery that, you know, leads you to believe that, hey, maybe I'm not  always going to be fat.  You sort of...  You know, you get a little bit, yeah, obsessed with...  Have you checked your genetics, though?  You might have to...  My parents are both.  You might just be one of them motherfuckers, man, that's just not going to be, you know,  a V.  You might not be LL Cool Jam.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  But I haven't tried everything yet. 
[00:53:00]  I used to be...  Yeah, he's going to try everything.  That's why I asked him what he's on these days, because I can't even keep up anymore,  you know?  Steve's going to walk around with an extra heart.  No, I'm not even...  In a suitcase.  No!  Oh, I'm dying!  Wait a minute.  Let me just...  Whew!  Dude.  Shit is kidney out.  Hold on.  There was a...  I think it was in the middle of winter when we're coming in here.  Right.  In really heavy coats and stuff, freezing our asses off.  He was...  He was there that day.  I think I was there.  He had a roll.  I was walking around the bathroom. 
[00:53:30]  Sweating.  Wait, you were sweating because you were cold or sweating because you were...  Now I don't know why you were sweating.  I was sweating because I took too much of one of the supplements I was on.  See, that's what I'm saying.  It made me shiver.  So you...  So the fucking fear of maybe shocking your body is less than the fact that you want to  be...  You want to look better.  Correct.  Like...  The fear of fat is...  We gravitate towards what we are more afraid...  What we are less afraid of.  So I am less afraid of shocking my body into some kind of convulsion than I am of being fat 
[00:54:00]  again.  Oh.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  So he was on this supplement that was...  It was scary because he was walking around just dripping sweat with...  And everyone's like, Steve, what's up, man?  You sick?  You want to go home?  Sweating.  You blew that one off though, right?  Yeah.  That one's not taking any more.  So...  Damn.  And they're worried about stupid Barry Bonds.  We're worried about our little Steve here.  I wonder if looking...  If we're looking like...  Oh, look at that picture.  See?  Oh, and that's why Steve...  Look at Steve.  That'll do it.  Look at Steve.  That'll do it.  Can you do a before and after?  Yeah.  Steve, do it. 
[00:54:30]  You want hits on your website.  You do a before and after, people will be like, wow.  Steve wants to be a hot chick.  Wow.  He really wants to be hot.  So...  God bless you.  I cannot believe you're ever that...  Now, how's your wife?  Is your wife doing the same thing you're doing?  She's...  No, she's not.  She is...  She goes to the gym a lot, but she's...  And she helps.  She's very supportive.  What?  Your wife, huh?  I think she's beautiful.  All right.  Is Steve's wife...  Is his wife, huh?  She's definitely all right, man.  Is she really?  Yeah.  All right.  Good enough.  Because I was going to say, if she was like a fat guy's wife...  Are you crazy anyway, asking... 
[00:55:00]  Like, what kind of answer are you going to get out of here?  I would tell you if my bitch was okay.  If you're...  But you can't ask Opie if his girl's hot.  If Steve's girl's hot.  Because he's going to say...  He's going to say...  He loves his wife.  But he might go, yeah, she's hot, but on some love shit.  Like a picture of E-Rock going, uh, Anthony, is Patrice's girl hot?  You go...  If Anthony goes, eh, what am I going to do? 
[00:55:30]  That's an insult to you, your girl, everything.  No, it's not, motherfucker.  That's like a nigga saying, yo, I fucked your girl.  Good job, nigga.  Did you choke her like me, motherfucker?  Huh?  Did you hang her head out the window like I do, you fuck face?  How was the pussy there?  I wouldn't get offended.  Motherfuckers are so tender.  Get the fuck out of here.  God damn you motherfuckers make me sick with that shit.  Dude.  Fuck, I give a fuck.  What do you think of my bitch? 
[00:56:00]  We live in the real world.  You niggas is crazy, man.  You live in the context.  I just want to know...  It is what it is.  You live on the black version of Earth.  No, I don't.  You see how fucking gun-shy you black people have gotten white people?  We're afraid to say anything about anything.  Girls, it's all gone.  It all stemmed from the black people.  Where we were afraid to say that.  Now we're afraid of everything.  Retards, fucking everything.  We can't say shit about nothing.  You two crazy motherfuckers. 
[00:56:30]  I can't believe I just got a goddamn speech.  You niggas just said, fuck that homeless bitch.  And I go, is his wife hot?  Got all slavery and shit.  Oh, Lord, I don't ask no questions like that.  What if I open-ass me, is your girl hot?  If he goes, I don't think so, I'll be like, all right, cool enough, nigga.  Then I won't be working in the house no more.  They put me back out in the field.  Jesus Christ, man.  Your girl's all right.  Shit, whatever.  Like, a lot of white guys wouldn't think my girl's all right, man. 
[00:57:00]  She's got a lot of ass, a lot of titty.  Your chick's smoking.  You know what I'm saying?  She got up on stage.  She might be too big.  I think she looks good.  On stage, she look hot.  Well, it's hot and shit.  You did certain things.  Look, I'll speak for the room.  Everyone was like, what?  Patrice got that?  Yeah.  I don't fuck around, nigga.  And I never fuck with ugly bitches.  I refuse, because I was like, Steve.  But here's what I did.  I took mental oxy powder.  You did a brain shit. 
[00:57:30]  I let my body go to shit.  But you let your brain take a dump.  I'm going to work out my mind every day, six days a week, 16 eggs.  You know what I'm saying?  But I was like, Patrice must be a smooth operator, because how is he getting that?  How are you getting that?  And she knows I'll get another one.  Like, she knows I'll get another one, because she's seen me talk.  Uh-huh.  She's seen me talk.  So I'll just get another one.  That's my working out.  But I still need to work out for my health.  But I wish I could be shocked to be that obsessive. 
[00:58:00]  But when you get like that, you gain things, but you lose things.  You know what I mean?  You just lose.  I don't have no.  I just.  It's taken Steve years, though.  Yeah, hold on.  Hold on.  Steve's looking good.  Let's say hi to Gino in Philly.  Gino.  Yeah, I want to say, Patrice, man, you're the only motherfucker in the studio.  A guy who is big enough to tell Steve the truth to his face.  I'm his only friend in this motherfucker.  I'm like, Steve, you're a little tender in the belly part.  You look sexy, but you're still poppable. 
[00:58:30]  But he's working on it.  That's like, you know, somebody's in a race and halfway down to the finish line, Patrice  is going, you're not at the finish line.  What the fuck's the matter with you?  The guy's still running.  This guy on the phone knows the context of which I meant.  I meant like, that was my way of going.  You know what, Steve?  God damn, you're looking good.  But I'm like, to work out that much, I see the tumble.  So basically, I'm going, so what's going on?  If I know it, he knows it.  Oh, he's saying it again.  I'm saying, so what's going on? 
[00:59:00]  I'm looking for help.  Like, I'm going, what's going on where this thing ain't happening?  Where it's not just V-ing up like that.  And I know he's been working hard, but the motherfucker, the rest of his body is looking tender.  Sexy.  Shoulders, arms.  So I'm going, wait, Steve, still a little kissable down there.  You think those arms are a little soft?  No, like, in shape.  Like, you can see this motherfucker's body changing.  He's obsessed with working on it. 
[00:59:30]  What are you doing about the sides and the belly?  What are you doing?  A lot of cardio, a lot of just constant cardio and ab workouts.  And the reason this is still softer in here is, number one, I was really fat and had a lot of extra skin down there, and it was all stretched out.  But two, this is when you lose weight, especially when you work out this much, you shred it from the top down.  So that's the last part to go, is the midsection.  All right, let's say how to mark the trucker.  Mark.  All right, fair enough.  There you go. 
[01:00:00]  Fair enough.  Hey, I just got to say thanks to Patrice for bringing a funny back to the show.  Hobo come.  It's rock bottom.  All right.  There you go.  So anyway, Steve.  Okay.  I don't even know why we brought you in here.  Audio.  Oh, the Twitchels thing?  Twitchels.  Yes.  The Twitchels video is getting downloaded like crazy, and other websites are picking up on it.  Yeah, definitely.  Slapping his face with the pudding and the ketchup and all the other stuff we put in his hands.  Classic.  We learned, if you didn't get to hear the show a lot this week, that Twitchels, our Tourette's guy, his new tick is that he slaps himself really hard because he went to a Tourette's conference, and he picked that one up. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know why you would go to a Tourette's conference because all you're going to get is good ideas.  He's got his good ideas.  Yeah.  That's good.  I'm going to smack myself in the head.  Right.  That's a good one.  So we tried to cure him, so we started putting all sorts of stuff in his hands, like pudding.  And he started slapping the crap out of his face, even though he had pudding in his hands, and the video's hilarious. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, and it's making the rounds.  It hit GorillaMask.net yesterday.  The guys at Break put it up, and they contacted me this morning, and they were very, first of all, they were very happy that they got talked about yesterday, but they said between now and Sunday it'll get hit over a million times.  Break.com?  Yeah, Break.com.  And I fully expect to see it on WebJunk 20.  Yeah, why wouldn't you throw that on WebJunk 20?  I would.  You call them up right now and say, I got a video. 
[01:01:30]  I tell them about Foundry.  I tell them about the Gorilla Mask of the world and all that shit, man.  They just kind of go, uh.  Like, I'm just the guy that goes, hey, Patrice O'Neal.  Hey.  But I'm like, hey, man, if you're having problems, go to somebody who's fucking crazy.  I'm giving them five.  They want to stick to, like, one place.  We can make sure this show goes on for another couple seasons.  It's like fucking telling them.  Here's a number.  But you know how motherfuckers are.  You know how motherfuckers are.  Oh, yeah.  And then they act like they have their idea later.  Yep, right.  And it's like, oh, remember I said, oh, yes, yes. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, we've gotten some more videos from these places.  So Steve came up to me.  He was like, hey, we need da-da-da-da.  One day, he was like, you know, I go, yeah, I just talk about Foundry.  I said, go to Foundry.com, Steve.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Yes.  So Twitchell's.  We'll see if it's in the budget.  The Twitchell's video is up on opanthony.com.  It certainly is.  What's this teabagging thing?  We were supposed to play this yesterday.  Teabagging.  Audio from some news special, maybe Dateline, maybe 2020, of a kid, 15, 16-year-old kid 
[01:02:30]  who went away with a bunch of friends of his for a weekend, and they hazed him a little  bit, and the hazing consisted of teabagging.  Right.  Oh, shit.  A couple kids held him down while one kid teabagged him.  Teabagging.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  And they hold him down and they...  That's terrific.  Oh, it's not.  That's terrific.  They don't describe teabagging on Dateline or 60 Minutes.  This is teabagging.  What happened to this child was teabagging.  Right. 
[01:03:00]  With his stupid voice.  Do you know what your kids are doing at these parties?  They held him down.  It just can't get better from there.  They spider-manned him.  They gave him the Roman war helmet.  You know what the Spider-Man is?  What?  It's the one that's good.  You come in your hand and then sling it in her face.  I thought I heard all of them.  I thought I heard all of them. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's a good one.  Wham.  Oh, fff.  Do, do, do, do, do.  He stinks and I don't like him.  Oh, is that a good one?  That's great.  All right, let's get back to this story.  A couple kids held him down while one kid teabagged him.  Teabagging is when they hold him down and they rub their exposed genitals on their faces. 
[01:04:00]  Then they rubbed him over, told him to be found when they attempted to insert a banana in his record.  My trust in people has gone down a lot.  Your grades went down, too?  Yeah.  I didn't do anything in school.  I didn't go to the classes and when I did, I just sat there and did nothing.  I spent 15 years working my butt off, keeping my kids safe.  Now look.  Listen, I sat away with you for three nights and look at what I get back. 
[01:04:30]  This is what I get back.  I get back a totally different kid.  Oh, wow.  He got teabagged.  They attempted the dirty Sanchez.  Gave her son the angry pirate.  The magic dragon.  The what?  The magic dragon.  You come in her mouth and when she tries to spit out, you hold it closed and then tickle  and it comes out her nose. 
[01:05:00]  Wow.  Oh, is that brutal?  I'll say it again.  I thought I heard it all.  That's another one I never heard of.  Oh, is that good?  It all came to a head with a donkey punch. 
[01:05:30]  It's just brutal, man.  Wow, that was bad.  So they held him down, rubbed their nutsack on his face, just teabagging, and then flipped  him over and tried to stick a banana up his ass.  Oh, my God.  Not going to fall for the old banana up the ass trick.  Oh, man.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana  phone.  Oh.  Damn it.  What are you looking for? 
[01:06:00]  All right.  Let me hear that song again.  All right.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, mother.  Hold on.  Let's not get lazy on a Friday.  Let's go wrong form.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oh.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot? 
[01:06:30]  I got a feeling.  So appealing.  I wish I knew I'd quit you.  Get together and sing.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Keep your hands up, man.  No.  It's the best.  Beats the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana phone.  chá»£.  Banana phone.  It's no bologna. 
[01:07:00]  It ain't a pony.  My cellular.  Banana phone.  Three simple words.  I am gay.  Yes, I am gay.  Let's go to Joe in Chicago.  Joe.  Boys, have you heard of the Tony Danza?  What's the Tony Danza?  Tony Danza, when you're banging a chick doggy style, she won't let you come in or toot.  You spit on her back and you tell her you came.  When she turns around, you smack her in the face of your dick and you go,  Who's the boss?  That's the cop that got shot in the foot. 
[01:07:30]  That shot himself in the foot.  What?  That's the cop that shot himself in the foot.  Oh, the cop that shot himself in front of the class.  He was doing a demonstration.  And he goes to take his gun out.  And he had, it was loaded.  Who is he suing and why?  Oh, my God.  This guy's suing?  How could he sue?  Let's get the, uh...  He brought a loaded weapon in.  Wait, I'm really confused.  First of all, Joe, thanks for the call.  Here, here's the clip.  He, uh, he's demonstrating things to the class.  He goes to pull his gun out.  And, uh, it goes off and he shoots himself in the leg. 
[01:08:00]  And, uh...  Now he's suing after shooting himself?  Who is he suing?  All right, someone, uh...  Now, look.  They'll check out the story and, uh...  And, uh, give it to us in a little bit here.  This big motherfucker.  See, he takes his gun out.  Why would you...  Oh, it's a loaded weapon.  He could have shot someone in the classroom. 
[01:08:30]  Uh, here's my gun.  He's holding his gun up.  He's a big motherfucker, huh?  Yep.  He's got a little belly fat, though, and some love handling.  And then, look.  He goes to put it away.  Bam!  There it goes.  It goes off.  He shoots himself.  He's limping around.  And he's telling the class, it's okay.  It's okay.  This, uh, just shows how dangerous these guns can be.  And, uh, everyone pretty calm sitting there.  I saw this clip when I was on Letterman.  This is one of the clips that you showed.  This is one of the clips he showed. 
[01:09:00]  Have you played this on Web Chunk?  Yes!  This is the first show!  All right.  Tonight.  This stupid motherfucker shot himself.  And what?  Who could he be suing?  You know what's the best part?  As he's limping around after he shot himself, some, uh, chick, I guess, came back into the  classroom, has no idea what's going on, and walked right behind him, like, uh, trying  to find her seat again.  Hey, uh, what happened?  He must feel just ridiculous, because this is like...  Oh, we gotta find out why he's suing.  I wanna know who he could be suing.  The school?  But look, he has the I'm suing glasses on. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, he certainly does.  The I'm suing suit.  And his dreads are pulled back.  Yeah, his dreads are pulled back in a ponytail.  Could please somebody tell Bubba Smith why is he suing?  Bubba Smith.  Why is Bubba Smith, is he suing Police Academy 5 for fucking up his career?  I wanna know.  We'll find out in a few minutes.  Jeff in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, oh, hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey, I was wondering if you boys or Patrice had heard of the Screaming Seagull?  That's, that's also known as the Chicken Cutlet.  The Chicken Cutlet. 
[01:10:00]  You fuck your girl on the beach, you stick it in the pussy, then pull it out, stick it  in the sand, and then stick it back in the pussy.  Yeah, that's the one.  Oh, so it's like breaded.  Yeah, it's breaded.  It's chicken par.  The Screaming Seagull.  You know, that's a lot of self-sacrifice there.  Yeah, that's just what...  Because if any goes in the tip, you're done.  Oh, it's just...  Like someone just violent. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Punch.  Oh, sorry.  Does Steve know why he's suing?  Well, we got it.  Who he's suing?  The DEA for releasing the video?  Okay, yeah.  Is that true?  Dan's pulling the audio right now, but he's going after the government for releasing the  video.  Whoa.  Oh, because he...  But he...  I don't blame him.  I look like an asshole.  Yes, exactly.  I look like a fucking idiot.  That's exactly what he's suing for.  We need to release a video like that for our enjoyment.  But who says the DEA released it?  Did they release it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We'll get the full story.  I heard he left it in a camera on a school shelf and some... 
[01:11:00]  It's like Star Wars kids.  And if you watch that video over and over, man, the one thing is that the kids didn't move.  He shot himself, and they just was like, this is so interesting.  Meaning that's got to be a school district in a bad neighborhood.  Holy shit.  If that happened out where I went to high school, we're running out of the building.  The DEA doesn't send someone in to give a chat in the nice schools. 
[01:11:30]  You know?  A DEA agent isn't pulling out his fucking gun in the nice schools at Assemblies.  At Wynworth Academy.  My what?  Today, we're going to bring in a drug enforcement agent that's going to show you his firearm and  how you can stay off the drug.  It doesn't happen.  Yeah.  You have like career day when the guy from fucking Apple comes in.  I started my career in a garage with Bill Gates, and it was a wonderful thing. 
[01:12:00]  Here's this school.  Look at this guy.  He's pulled his gun out in a classroom.  A loaded gun.  Back in the pocket.  Bam!  There it goes.  And he's suing...  And what is this?  It must be mental stress he's suing over.  Wait, so he's suing because the DEA released a video, right?  Yeah.  But he's on the Today Show giving an exclusive interview as they show the videotape over and  over and over again.  So far, five times.  Over again, right.  Five times.  Maybe it's that it's ruined his career. 
[01:12:30]  You know his woman's like, baby, you should sue.  He can't do anything.  Yeah.  Baby, you should sue.  You know after he got back from his sick leave, from getting a bullet in the leg when  he's in the locker room with the rest of the agents.  Hey, what happened over there?  Put his gun in the hose.  Everybody's like, get out!  Get out!  He shot his gun out!  Some smartass lit a firecracker and threw it in near him.  You know they just fucked with him.  You know, it took his whole life.  That's all he wanted to be.  Yeah.  And he just shot his foot. 
[01:13:00]  And you know his career is over.  He had to be fired after that.  Yeah, had to.  All right, we'll get the...  Part of the solution here, people.  People, I grew up in a bad neighborhood, and I figured I'd go into DEA and really clean  up things, and bam, blows his friggin' gun off in the classroom.  Bye-bye.  You want to hear something else here?  Some dude from Chicago.  Where's his email?  Hey, Chicago.  We love when the listeners help us out.  We love when the pests help us out.  Brad from Chicago sent an email to Ben. 
[01:13:30]  I'm sending you two clips.  I know O&A liked their Earl Weaver rant, but I think this one is better.  It's Lee Elia?  How do you say his name?  E-L-I-A?  And he's cursing out the Cubs fans after a game.  That's wise.  I don't know how old this clip is.  Maybe someone from Chicago could call us up and give us a little more detail.  Maybe even Brad himself.  I could only imagine what a strawberry milkshake is.  I don't want to know.  I know that one.  Is that when it's her time? 
[01:14:00]  I know that one.  Do you know what the Angry Pirate is?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Jim on Long Island.  Arr.  Arr.  Jim?  Yo.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I got the strawberry milkshake.  Yeah.  You come in the chick's mouth and you just fucking punch her.  See that?  That's how I'm like the jelly donut.  Here's one.  Here's one.  The cement mixer.  You're fucking up doggy style and she hits her head on the wall and paint chips fall from  the ceiling into her head and then you come in it and mix it all up. 
[01:14:30]  That's got to be in the ghetto.  Where are paint chips falling off the ceiling?  Like I said, I thought I heard all of them, but man, the ghetto version of this game is  much better.  That TV's going to be calling you.  They're going to do a six-show series on this.  What's a flat soda?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  Josh on Long Island.  Josh?  I got the flat soda?  Yep.  It's when you come in her mouth and then quickly punch her in the stomach and it dribbles 
[01:15:00]  out the sides.  That doesn't really make much sense.  I kind of get what he's saying.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You shouldn't call it a flat soda.  Make a better word.  Let's go to Jason in Arizona.  Jason?  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  They got one called the rodeo.  The rodeo.  Okay.  Yeah.  You get your girl doggy style and you get in her and then you tell her,  this is how your sister likes it. 
[01:15:30]  And you got to stay in her before she tries to get up and start kicking your ass.  Yeah.  I heard that one.  You got to stay on for eight seconds.  Yeah.  That's an old one.  We don't want to do old ones.  Sally.  Hi.  Hi.  Lee Elia was manager of the Cubs for the 82 season and part of the 83 season.  That's all they could stand him for, I guess.  Oh, yeah.  Sally.  Oh, damn.  This is an old clip then, huh?  Oh, that's going back a few years.  I'd say.  It's going back.  Huh?  What did you say? 
[01:16:00]  Before God invented the computer even.  Hey, before God invented the computer, there's what Sally's saying.  Hey, Sally, you know what the dolphin is?  No.  It's when you try to fuck your girl on the ass.  She goes, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  How about the Dick Cheney?  What's that?  He shoots you in the face and then swears he thought you were game.  No?  No?  I love it.  I love it. 
[01:16:30]  She's super Chicago, right?  No?  I like Sally.  What, nothing?  She's super Chicago, right?  Hey, didn't get a thing from that one over there.  So, Sally, the co-  You left me hanging.  All right, Sipowitz.  Sally.  Yes.  So, the Cubs were real awful in 82 and 83?  The Cubs were real awful forever until about a couple seasons ago.  And that was one season.  That was it.  Yeah, that was it.  Well, good old Lee.  I guess he was talking to the press after a game and he just finally had it with the  Cubs fans. 
[01:17:00]  And I've never heard this clip before, by the way.  So, I want to thank Brad from Chicago for sending it in.  Hey, thank you, Sally.  All right, Sally.  Bye.  Listen to this.  This guy goes off, Lee.  I'll tell you one fucking thing.  I hope we get fucking hotter than shit just to stuff it up them 3,000 fucking people that  show up every fucking day.  Because if they're the real Chicago fucking fans, they can kiss my fucking ass right downtown  and print it. 
[01:17:30]  They're really, really behind you around here.  My fucking ass.  What the fuck am I supposed to do?  Go out there and let my fucking players get destroyed every day and be quiet about it for  the fucking nickel-dime people to show up?  The motherfuckers don't even work.  That's why they're out at the fucking game.  They only go out and get a fucking job and find out what it's like to go out and earn a  fucking living.  85% of the fucking world's working.  The other 15 come out here.  The fucking playground for the cocksuckers. 
[01:18:00]  Rip them motherfuckers.  Rip them cocksuckers like the fucking players.  Got guys busting their fucking ass and them fucking people too.  And that's the cunts?  My fucking ass.  They talk about the great fucking support that the players get around here.  I haven't seen it this fucking yet.  The name of the game is hit the ball, catch the ball, and get the fucking job done. 
[01:18:30]  Right now, we have more losses than we have wins.  The fucking changes that have happened in the cup organization are multifold.  All right.  They don't show because we're 5-14.  And unfortunately, that's the criteria of them dumb 15 motherfucking percent that come  out to date baseball.  The other 85% are earning a living.  It'll take more than a 5-13 or 5-14 to destroy the makeup of this club. 
[01:19:00]  I'll guarantee you that.  There's some fucking pros out there that want to fucking play this game.  But you're stuck in a fucking stigma of the fucking Dodgers and the Phillies and the Cardinals  and all that cheap shit.  All these motherfucking editorials about say and fucking the Philly-itis and all that shit  that's just sickening.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  It's a disheartening fucking situation we're in right now. 
[01:19:30]  5-14 doesn't negate all that work.  We've got 143 fucking games left.  What I'm trying to say is don't rip them fucking guys out there.  Rip me.  If you want to rip somebody, rip my fucking ass.  But don't rip them fucking guys because they're giving everything they can give.  But once we hit that fucking groove, it'll flow.  And it will flow.  The talent's there.  I don't know how to make it any clearer to you. 
[01:20:00]  I'm frustrated.  I'll guarantee I'm frustrated.  It'd be different if I walked in this room every day and saw a bunch of guys that didn't give a shit.  They give a shit.  And it's a tough National League East.  It's a tough National League period.  Wow.  That is a good rant.  Fucking amazingly honest, that dude, man.  A tough individual.  Listen to this.  Warren in Jersey.  Warren.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  The interesting part about this clip is that he got fired at the end of the season. 
[01:20:30]  And the Cubs made the playoffs the next year.  The next year.  So he was telling the truth.  He said he had the players on the team.  I guess so.  He had the talent.  God bless that guy.  Wow.  Very good, Warren.  Thank you.  Sure.  I don't understand the bashing of the people that show up, though.  They were booing him.  Is that what the problem was?  Yeah.  He's like, fuck you, booing me.  You jobless motherfuckers.  We should be booing you.  That's genius.  He's like, coming out during an afternoon Monday game at 12 in the afternoon, booing his team. 
[01:21:00]  And you don't have a fucking job, you hunks of shit.  And we're trying.  Because they're supposed to be fans of the team.  And so basically saying, look, we're trying.  We got the talent.  Well, then, you know, give us some ballsy speech, then.  That's genius.  And I bet you the fans never booed again.  And I bet you the team got better.  Just because of that, man.  You know, at 82, 83, you could go to a game and it was still pretty cheap.  So, you know.  Nowadays, man, if your team sucks, I have no problem booing. 
[01:21:30]  And nice and loud, too, man.  If it's nice and fucking loud.  Like, you can boo the Knicks.  Absolutely.  Like, the Knicks, because the amount of money you're spending to go see the Knicks, which is one of the worst teams in the NBA this year.  $1,900 for floor seats.  Yeah.  You should be able to boo and do whatever the hell you want.  That's amazing.  If they're not trying.  But, like, say the New Orleans Hornets, if you're a basketball fan, the New Orleans Hornets or...  A team on the way up, by the way.  Like, somebody, they just try and you see that they want to win. 
[01:22:00]  They just don't have it.  But the Knicks, motherfucker, they're horrible.  And Larry Browns is just...  But this guy, man, I feel...  That's what I feel about comedy sometimes.  Like, are you serious?  Like, am I trying to, like...  How much pressure are you putting on me to make your day, you loser, motherfucker?  God damn it.  You're going to yell at the audience.  Yeah, give me a break.  It's like it's not about...  It's about the fans pushing you.  Like, the fans going, come on, motherfucker.  You do this for us. 
[01:22:30]  And you go, you know what?  I wanted to go to sleep, but you know something?  I'm fucking awake now because I want to do well for you.  And they go, boo, fuck you.  Yeah, but if you're spending, you know, a lot of money to go to a comedy show or a sporting event and then the...  Fuck, the drinks aren't cheap anymore.  There was an article about Yankee Stadium, how much the beers are this season.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, you got to pay for Johnny Damon, then.  So you're expecting some really good entertainment because you're shelling out some serious bucks.  It's not an excuse, but it's like...  That's why Ant and I never charge our listeners to get into one of our events. 
[01:23:00]  Nope.  We keep the expectations nice and low so they don't start booing our shit.  That's it. They can't boo. It was free to get in, you shithead.  That's right.  Can you beat Chuck Lydell in a fight, you think?  Mm-mm.  Or whatever.  Any Joe Rogan, you know what I mean?  It's like, if you can't, you can't.  Right?  So it's like, these teams, they can't.  These motherfuckers just can't.  So it's like, don't boo a nigga.  Well then, you know what?  Because he can't? 
[01:23:30]  You know what?  Then you got to drop the prices until the team gets better.  Drop the prices to...  But that's why the prices are high, so you can get a motherfucker for the beer.  I understand.  No, I understand.  I understand how the economics of sports and all that works and how you got to spend the money to get the players and stuff.  But if your team is, you know, blowing chunks, then you got to give something back to the fans.  Give something back so they're not booing.  I'm not kidding.  Like the Islanders.  Free fingers.  Hold on.  Free foam fingers for everybody.  Hold on.  The Islanders, they're not going to make the playoffs this year, right? 
[01:24:00]  Okay.  So they're handing out tickets like crazy to get as many people into the stands for the last few remaining games.  The drive for five is over.  Let's be honest, Ope.  What?  Hockey stinks.  It's not a real sport.  Hockey's a great sport to watch.  And they need...  I would watch a hockey game way before I would watch an entire baseball game.  They're rebuilding a lost season.  You remember what baseball was doing after...  The strike, yeah.  That's why they're not fucking with Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa on that steroid shit. 
[01:24:30]  Them motherfuckers put baseball back on the map.  Yeah.  So hockey is different because it's trying to get people back.  Hockey's getting there, man.  They signed a contract with NBC.  Fair enough.  And it's getting better, though.  Hockey's watchable.  Yeah.  They are definitely getting there.  Hockey's getting more and more exciting.  Now they've got the shootouts and stuff.  When these games end in a tie, they're on their way.  Like I said, there's so much more action in hockey.  I would rather sit through a hockey game than a baseball game. 
[01:25:00]  Can you explain?  I'm a Mets fan, and they've got a great team this year, and they're going places.  But the pacing of a baseball game, I can't handle it.  It's unwatchable.  Explain to me.  They should give you a version of a baseball game that lasts one hour.  And the purists will be like, no, man, that's what's so great about it.  Pitching changes after every two fucking innings.  That's what's great about it.  I can't be bothered.  You could start watching a game at 8 o'clock at night, and in 2 in the morning, it's still going. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  And 100.  Here's the thing about baseball bugs me.  They should repackage baseball games and make it an hour long.  A hundred and, what, 70 games or some shit?  The star pitcher pitches 30 times or some shit.  30.  This motherfucker has a part-time job, and he's a zillionaire.  They made it really difficult to be a 20-game winner.  When we were growing up, there were 20-game winners all the time.  Because everybody was fat pigs trying to swing the bat.  No, they got a lot more starts. 
[01:26:00]  What?  It was like four pitchers to a team back then, right?  For the most part, four starters.  Now it's what?  They averaged five, six?  Five, five or six starters there.  Now, can you explain to me a layman like myself in hockey, just being that you're a hockey fan,  just one of the things that, okay, just watching it, I'm like, oh, God, somebody killed me.  But what are you watching for that's fun other than the scoring?  My fellow hockey fans are going to get mad at me, or the purest, but I love the hitting and the fighting.  Love it. 
[01:26:30]  Can't get enough of the hitting.  So without it, though, without it, how's it a nice good sport?  Well, they're trying to take the fighting out of the game, and that's such a bad, bad thing to do, man.  They're checking into the boards and just knocking people down.  As someone that hates basketball, because I can't stand the game, I look at it the same way you're looking at hockey.  I see no fun, excitement, or thrill in watching that game.  There is nothing that goes on.  Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk.  What's the score?  A hundred and fucking two?  I mean, it's ridiculous. 
[01:27:00]  As a basketball fan, okay, to watch a motherfucker jump 11 feet and dunk it over a motherfucker that's 7 feet tall,  or take something, I get by, it would be hard for me to get by you with nothing in my hand,  let alone dribbling something past you.  But that's exciting in hockey, when you see a guy rushing down toward the net, and he's got one guy in front of him,  and he's now got to slip it around him, and then get it around the goalie.  That shit's exciting. 
[01:27:30]  Fair enough.  And the score, you know, you're looking at 3-4, you know, the score's like that.  So when they do score, it's so exciting.  Basketball, it's like, oh, there's another two.  Oh, there's another two.  It's so difficult.  Oh, there's another two, though.  Oh, it's so ridiculous.  But then you like soccer, then.  You must like soccer.  Oh, soccer stinks.  No, soccer, I can't stand it.  It's nothing but hockey with feet.  Nah, the field is so goddamn big.  We can all agree that.  Half the time, they're just fucking running.  We can all agree that soccer stinks.  Bunch of uncut fucking Spaniards.  Let the rest of the world have soccer. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, take it.  It blows.  Take it.  Call it football, maybe we'll catch on.  Maybe you'll trick the Americans.  You know, football is really soccer, is it?  Yeah, okay, I'm tuning in.  Who gives a shit?  Who fucking has?  They've been trying to make soccer exciting in America for so many years.  It's time to give up on that dumb thing.  It won't happen.  Oh, no.  Three billion people a year watch the World Cup.  Biggest sport.  Who gives a fuck?  Great.  Get me a Brazilian flag.  I'll tie it to the hood of my fucking Escalade.  I'm so excited.  If it ain't big in this country, it ain't big. 
[01:28:30]  Do you know that Chow Yun-Fat is the greatest?  Great.  He is the most famous movie star in the world.  Oh, really?  Not here, nigga.  He's a co-star to fucking Paul Sorvino's daughter, nigga.  Yeah, he's an extra.  He's an extra in American film.  Shut up.  We are just so pompous.  That's why they hate us.  That's why they hate us.  That is why we are hated.  Really?  Mary Sorvino and Chow Yun-Fat.  Chow Yun-Fat.  And some horseshoe.  Why are you the number one star? 
[01:29:00]  Why are you second bearing?  Why?  Because he stinks.  He stinks.  Soccer stinks.  Soccer is awful.  Soccer.  My kids will not play soccer.  Someone has to start the movement.  Oh, there's running down field.  What sport are you going to say, this is what my play might be?  If you had to build a, say you're going to push your kid to play a sport with him.  My sport was basketball.  I didn't get the height, unfortunately.  I really wanted to be in the NBA.  You would push your kid.  I went to all the basketball camps and all that. 
[01:29:30]  Here's what you got to do.  I was probably baseball.  Baseball, obviously.  Got to be baseball.  Because then you could start him out young and it doesn't matter what happened unless they  got some kind of fucking deformity.  But I mean, he doesn't have to grow into a giant to play basketball.  Or an animal to play football.  My nephew is obsessed with hockey.  He started out as baseball.  He's eight.  He can't get enough.  He's already playing hockey.  He'll play hockey, too.  You could get the kid into hockey.  Baseball.  Hockey's an expensive sport, though.  You got to have cash.  My sister doesn't have the cash and her son wants hockey and she's like, oh, shit. 
[01:30:00]  That's why I'm saying there's no black hockey players.  Well, not as many.  Very hard in the projects to set up the outdoor hockey rink.  And when do you practice?  And when do you get ten motherfuckers to go play hockey?  Or how many you need to like, hey, fellas.  Hey, you know, this is, hey, hi, Ms. Johns.  This is Greg.  Can, hey, dude, we're going to go play hockey?  How?  How do you get good at hockey?  You got to live in Canada.  You got to live somewhere cool.  Why not a guy like Crosby? 
[01:30:30]  How does he get good?  He's from Canada.  Is Crosby from Canada?  He is great, too.  What's that guy?  Crosby, right?  Crosby, right?  He's got to be from Canada.  Yeah, because they got to.  I'll probably look stupid, but he's got to be.  A pond freezes over and you get ten guys.  You got to simplify all this stuff.  Like, that's why the Canadians are so great.  While we're, you know, going outside to play baseball with our pals,  they're going outside to play hockey.  There's frozen freaking ponds everywhere.  To us, Long Island, I can take Long Island as an example.  We grew up and we loved hockey because the Islanders were so great. 
[01:31:00]  So we were like, hey, all right, let's play hockey.  And you would get rink time at, like, 2, 3 in the morning if you were lucky.  And then the Canadians, same kids your age, they're going outside at 2 in the afternoon  after school and playing hockey every fucking day.  Play some street hockey.  Street hockey was great.  Car!  Car!  You have to move the net out of the middle of the road.  Oh, street hockey rocks.  Drive by.  You need a stick.  You need a helmet.  How do you get skewed?  We just need a ball for basketball, right? 
[01:31:30]  You have to learn how to ice skate.  Dude.  That's a faggy thing in itself to be great for on ice skates.  That is true.  Did you just say helmet?  Eh, well.  It's the faggity parents nowadays that invented the helmets.  Yeah, you know, you got to point out.  When we grew up, we didn't have helmets.  You got to point out.  We didn't bike ride with helmets.  We didn't play street hockey with helmets.  We barely had a helmet when we were playing Little League.  You know what?  Yeah, because you know. 
[01:32:00]  I remember jumping my bicycle over ramps we made over garbage.  There were no helmets involved.  I think I tore my ACL when I was 11.  When you were 11.  And limped it off.  And came out and played the next day.  And had a high school football career.  With a torn ACL at 6.  We just did.  We just did fucked up.  You did think you had no safety equipment.  Hey, get on the handlebars.  I'll ride you home.  Oh, your foot got caught in the spokes.  Helmets.  Look at that mess.  Our generation didn't have helmets.  Helmets.  Pussies. 
[01:32:30]  To this day, I don't wear a helmet.  I'm in line skating.  Getting up to some stupid speeds.  Going down hills.  You shouldn't go down.  No helmet.  And hip guards.  Insane.  When did this culture of Karen.  Like football.  I love it.  Unwatchable.  Because like T.O.  It started with the quarterback.  You can't fuck him up.  But when I was a kid.  Or whatever.  When I was playing high school football.  If you hit a motherfucker, right?  And he didn't move.  And he was maybe paralyzed. 
[01:33:00]  There's no fucking way we would hold the other team's hand.  And pray for this motherfucker to get up.  We'll be like.  We'll dance over his fucking carcass.  While he's shaking like Hulk Hogan.  Before he puts up the one finger.  And go, yeah, motherfucker.  That nigga's paralyzed.  And then mark his number on your towel.  Laugh at his mama.  That's.  That's what the fuck.  Yeah, your son's dead, bitch.  That's what we did in high school football.  I'm with you.  Because I.  I knew we were going to talk about football on this break as well. 
[01:33:30]  Because we're talking about all the sports and the NFL.  It's like, will you let all this shit happen?  Let them dance their asses off in the end zone.  I want to see that.  And if they dance too much, the other team's going to be pissed.  And the hits are going to get even better when that motherfucker's, you know, running for the goal the next time.  And they'll try to hit you.  But the thing about the NFL, like entertainment, like whatever, it's a fraternity, man.  These guys, for the most part, are not trying to take food out of another motherfucker's mouth.  Because football is the worst sport to fuck it. 
[01:34:00]  It's the hardest and the worst in terms of financial, no guarantee contracts.  That's why they fight so hard for bonus money.  Because that's their money.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  But if they pop a kneecap, like they got the T.O. rule, which is when you can't hang on a motherfucker's back and pull him down no more because it might pop his knee.  But that's the shit.  Yeah, motherfucker.  I popped your knee, nigga.  But you really ain't trying to pop his knee.  Right.  But if it pops, you're like, I'm the knee popping motherfucker. 
[01:34:30]  Fred Williamson, the hammer, he used to hit motherfuckers, punch the top of the helmet, and it hurt.  And Deacon Jones would punch you in the side of your ear cavity.  And that's what the name sack comes from.  The name sack is, you take the quarterback, and then it's like you put him in a sack and beat him with a baseball bat.  That's where the term sack came from.  Now it's like you hold the quarterback, and it's in the grass. 
[01:35:00]  It's touch football as far as the quarterback is concerned.  You can't spear a guy with your helmet.  I'm sure you try to murder a motherfucker in football.  How do you edit collision course with another man when he's not looking?  You go, oh, my God, he's not looking.  I remember when I was 17, I said, oh, my God, this guy's not looking.  The whistle didn't blow.  He turned around, and I smashed his fucking face mask. 
[01:35:30]  His face mask was bent.  He didn't see 350 pounds coming at 4.7 speed, nigga.  And good night, bitch.  And I was over him hopping.  I was teabagging him.  I teabagged that nigga and Spider-Man that nigga.  Pointing in the crowd.  And it wasn't even a play I had anything to do with.  The touchdown was up there.  I just fucked up a motherfucker that wasn't looking.  Nigga, pay attention next time, bitch.  Where's your mom at?  Your son's dead. 
[01:36:00]  That is so true.  We were brutal.  You guys were modern-day gladiators.  I tried to fuck you up.  That's right.  And Gavin, that nigga plays rugby.  Oh, forget about it.  Gavin is the toughest motherfucker I've ever seen.  He was a rugby star in England, and they played football without fucking equipment.  That's what rugby is.  You think the rugby guys laugh at the NFLers?  I argue with that pussy about the difference between rugby and... 
[01:36:30]  Have you ever seen these rugby guys?  Have you ever been to a rugby game?  Never.  It's not football, though.  It's not football.  I understand.  They grab.  I understand.  My brother was really, really into rugby, and I went to a few of his matches.  It was insane.  They're tough motherfuckers, man.  I was like, you're not from the same mother as me.  What went on in your head that you have no problem playing this sport?  I could see Gavin killing somebody, though.  Dude, I would be scared shitless on a rugby field. 
[01:37:00]  Please.  It's not...  The difference between rugby and American football is the collision, the projectile hitting.  The, I'm running, and then you're running, and then somebody is not running anymore as  soon as that shit happens.  Rugby is a constant movement, and you grab.  There's no, oh shit, a motherfucker ain't looking.  Bloom!  To a guy in his naked tight shorts and his fucking no helmet. 
[01:37:30]  It'll be deaths all the time.  It's a, it's less collision, but it's tough.  Well, what, who, are the rugby guys tougher than football players?  Like, like, Gavin, Gavin is 6'6", 300 pounds.  Right.  He's, he could easily be an NFL linebacker, and probably with equipment, and he goes,  fucking mice, fucking helmet mice, oh my god, mice, I get to fucking hit a guy in his  mouth, mice, knock him, kill him. 
[01:38:00]  They're innately tougher, I think, than American fuck because it's no equipment, nothing, and  they're dirty, rotten motherfuckers, but the evil, the, we take things and just make it  a little bit better.  American football is a little more vicious.  You can kill a motherfucker in American football, but rugby dudes are fucking tough because they're  all the same size.  John Alama from New Zealand, 6'5", 310 pounds, and a 4'5", 40. 
[01:38:30]  A fucking 4'5", 40.  You know how dangerous that motherfucker is?  Jesus.  Unbelievable.  I'm telling you, dude.  Let me go to Mike in Detroit.  Mike, what's going on, man?  Hey, how you doing?  This is Mike out of Detroit.  Yeah.  I'm 37 years old.  My son's 10 years old.  He plays hockey up there in the peewee leagues and everything.  I grew up playing hockey.  We had to apologize to one of the kid's parents because my son hit him so good.  My son's a big kid, about 5 foot tall, 10 years old, 130 pounds. 
[01:39:00]  He's a defenseman.  The kid comes across a blue line, skating with his head down.  He delays them out.  They have to drag him off the freaking ice.  At the end of the game, we got to go over and apologize to the kid's parents.  And we got to be sincere.  And I'm just sitting there thinking to myself, hey, head up.  First thing they fucking teach you, you know?  How proud were you as a dad when your son's laying out all the kids?  Oh, dude, I was smiling from ear to ear as he's apologizing.  You know what?  At that point, those other kids should get out of the game. 
[01:39:30]  But instead, you got to apologize because we're all like equal and it's PC and everyone gets to play and no one gets hurt and everyone gets to score.  Was you silently, like, when you went home?  Now, as a father, I really wish I was a dad to a son, you know what I mean?  And let me ask you this.  After you see your son is a brute, right?  Do you, like, silently, like, push him to continue?  Or you go, son, you got to be a little more careful?  Or do you go, good job, son.  Like, thank you.  And another question is, are you going to be happy when he gets pussy at whatever age he gets pussy at? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, I'd be happy whenever he gets pussy.  Even at 12 or 11?  We went to Outback for steak dinner after a freaking game.  I was so happy.  Oh, what a fucking man.  What a man.  But do you push him to be, like, do you go, son, you know, good job killing that bastard.  No, my son's actually a straight-A student, goes to private school, very passive individual, except when he plays hockey.  That's his outlet.  I tell him, hey, you hit him, you hit him fucking good. 
[01:40:30]  That's awesome.  It's all it works, man.  Hey, speaking of getting hit nice and hard, we've been talking about this new website, break.com.  I was checking it out last night.  They're featuring our Twitchels videos.  Yes.  Where Twitchels slapping his face really hard with stuff in his hands, like pudding and stuff.  Oh, I love Twitch.  Anyway, there's a video that's right up on the front page of a kid getting just creamed at a hockey game into the boards,  and the entire glass just shatters, and the guy's down on the ice.  It is, check this out. 
[01:41:00]  A kid or a...  Well, I mean...  Oh, he's like a...  You know, it's probably, I don't know, if I had to guess, maybe 15-year-old, 16-year-old.  Oh.  Look at that.  And down he goes.  And boom goes to dynamite.  Oh, he tried to get up, and he's back down.  He's back down.  The video's unbelievable.  It's on break.com.  Oh, how proud would you be if you was the dad of that kid that just almost murdered that kid?  Oh, you slammed him, son.  You slammed him.  Good boy.  Scott the Trucker, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, up near Syracuse, it's kind of like hockey. 
[01:41:30]  I grew up playing lacrosse.  Yeah.  The only thing we had at the time was the gloves and a helmet.  We wore no shoulder pads, nothing.  Right.  You know, just the jersey and the shorts.  And now they got these little fucking kids, like my nephew, with the shoulder pads, the flag jacket.  They want to give them football pads with the thigh pads and all that shit.  They just learned how to take a fucking hit.  Oh, you got hit all.  Boo-hoo.  Fucking get up.  Walk it off.  Tape it up.  Get back out there and hit somebody else with the goddamn dick. 
[01:42:00]  I think a few kids getting paralyzed and stuff might have had something to do with it.  I see one kid at his helmet off on the side of the line.  You got to figure out what sport your kid's good at, though.  Blowing their knee out at, yeah, like seven years old.  Yeah, I had an injury at seven.  Ruined my career.  All right.  I saw my other nephew.  He's playing football.  And he's like, how old is he now?  Seven.  And he's seven or eight.  Football is seven?  Is that legal?  It is insane, man.  Wow.  And these kids are running off the field crying and, like, their knuckles hurt because 
[01:42:30]  they got smashed in between helmets.  And the moms have to run out and calm them down and give them a little, like, snack so  they can get back in the game.  And the father's like, if you want comedy, man, go see seven-year-olds play football.  It is one of the best days you could ever spend.  Well, like, want to be good?  The whole thing is insane.  Because the father's like, ah, it's all right.  Don't cry.  Get back out there.  And the mom's like, ah, I can't believe you.  And then, you know, cuddling the kid. 
[01:43:00]  Giving him all this equipment, crying.  Giving him a juicy box to calm him down.  A juicy box.  And then there's other mothers that have to be.  Oh, it's a fucking straw in it.  I'm not even kidding.  Through his face mask.  And then you see the father rolling his eyes like, oh, God, there you go, cuddling the  kid again.  It's unbelievable.  There's no juicy box in football.  No.  And, dude, there's a kid on my nephew's team, a black kid, that is so much bigger than everyone  else, just destroying everybody. 
[01:43:30]  That should not be legal.  And they don't know how to tell the kid not to play.  Because, you know, he's 7'8", and he's competitive like everybody else.  Put him in.  That's half the NFL draft him.  But you could also.  You could already tell that this kid is going to be a force in football.  Because that's going to be what the curve is at each level.  Like, I was that big.  I'm as big as I was every level of life.  So, you know, this kid is going to be this much bigger and this much better than every 
[01:44:00]  level.  Because those are the kids he's growing up with.  You know what I mean?  They already have some kind of nickname for him, like the Destroyer or some crazy name.  I thought it was something else.  The future big niggas.  The future big niggas.  I'm sure some of the fathers and mothers have a different nickname for him.  He's playing linebacker.  That frightening coon who's hitting my child.  Stay away from the Negro.  He's playing linebacker.  I hurt you.  He's playing linebacker and, you know, hike.  He's playing linebacker.  Oh, and he is just like the little kid is just trying to learn how to be a quarterback 
[01:44:30]  and this monster is running after him and he just drops the ball and runs away.  See, like, you know, his juicy, little juicy box.  I want your juice box, nigga.  Oh, yeah.  And then he's like, you fucked up my car.  Oh, shit.  Dude, you fucked up his car.  I'm telling you, if you want an entertaining afternoon, go watch a game.  Because then the coach is like, looks down the bench to see who's not crying anymore to  get them back in the game. 
[01:45:00]  Kids are running out crying all the time.  All the time.  Seven years old playing footballer.  That's beautiful, man.  I always had a goddamn son.  David.  Let me get somebody.  Yes.  Sorry to make your way, buddy.  We're in the middle of some dumb talk.  Hey, listen.  I got another call I got to do in nine minutes, though.  Wow.  All right.  We'll go quickly.  Are you, like, on the tour where you got to call us and call somebody else?  Yeah.  Who are you calling next?  Let's see.  No, I'm calling one contact number at six. 
[01:45:30]  Ah.  And then they set him up some.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  David, how do you say your last name?  I can never say your last name.  Heckner.  Yeah, I'm not going to butcher it.  You were on SNL 95, 96.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got a good memory.  Well, we got your bio in front of us.  I mean, you were in 40-Year-Old Virgin, Anchorman.  Right.  Dukes of Hazzard movie.  I mean, if people saw your face, they would be like, oh, my God, that guy.  Very, very funny.  And you're in the latest movie, Thank You for Smoking, which I saw, I think, last week. 
[01:46:00]  I loved it.  Thanks, man.  That's a good one, isn't it?  Well, it's a smart movie, so I'm wondering how many people are going to go see it.  Well, I think it's going to do really well.  They're expanding to 1,000-some theaters.  Oh, there you go.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Taking on Scary Movie 4 with your thank you for smoking.  It's a smarty-pants satire.  Right, exactly.  You want to explain the movie to everybody?  It's based on a Christopher Buckley novel. 
[01:46:30]  Uh-oh.  It's based on a novel from 92, and Christopher Buckley was taking on political correctness,  because that was the height of that certain atmosphere, if you will.  And so they skewer both sides of the issue of smoking, if you will.  All right.  But ironically, no one ever smokes in the movie.  So it's not about smoking.  It's about spin control.  It's about lobbyists.  It's about point of view. 
[01:47:00]  It's also got a little morality tale in there, because the father's got to, you're just talking  about fathers and sons.  The father's got to teach his son how to make an argument, how to argue.  Not necessarily right and wrong, but how you tell the difference between right and wrong,  and what is right and wrong.  Right.  Because these days, you know, people have opinions, but it doesn't necessarily make them right.  It's just like if someone's got a strong opinion, no one will challenge it and assume it's right.  Yeah, and the lead character, his whole job is to convince America that smoking is not as bad as you think. 
[01:47:30]  There are people out there that do that.  Yeah.  For a living.  Exactly.  It's their job.  And you play, actually, the head of the NRA, I guess, basically, or a lobbyist for the NRA.  The gun lobby.  They don't call it the NRA.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  Right.  The gun lobby.  And it's great because David's character gets together with the guy that's taking care of the smoking thing,  and the alcohol.  Oh, shoot.  Maria Bello.  That's right.  And she's, you know, she's trying to... 
[01:48:00]  The lobbyist for the alcohol industry.  So she's spinning, saying alcohol's not as bad, and the drunk driving thing is not as bad as people think,  and then David's character's the gun thing, and then the guy with the smoking,  and they get together and, like, you know, swap information.  Yeah, yeah, we hang out at a restaurant.  John, because we've all worked for these awful, we have these hard jobs of spinning for these companies that kill people.  Right.  And one way or another, or accidentally, whatever, I'm not going to spin for it. 
[01:48:30]  And we call ourselves the merchants of death.  The merchants of death, right.  And they get together and just compare notes and stuff to help each other's jobs out.  Right.  We compete with death figures.  Yeah.  And it turns out that the smoking thing is the worst as far as deaths every year, right?  As far as killers, yeah.  And then the alcohol and the gun thing just didn't seem too bad, actually.  Oh, yeah.  They don't even compare.  Right.  It didn't even come close.  Come on, 11,000 deaths a year? 
[01:49:00]  Right.  That doesn't even touch what I do.  Right.  I forget what his product kills.  I forget all the quotes, but they're pretty hilarious.  Yeah.  So, bottom line, you've got to go see this picture.  I really enjoyed it.  It's really good.  I definitely enjoyed the movie.  You smoke?  I don't.  No, huh?  I got kids.  Oh.  You smoke them?  Oh.  What do you think?  Yeah.  So, they smoke.  Never seen.  I tell you what.  My kids watch Grease.  And in Grease, because they're little kids, right? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Six and four, and they enjoy it.  And it's one of my wife's favorites.  So, they're watching the movie, and they smoke in that movie.  Yeah.  Swear to God, the next day, they take a straw and act like they're smoking.  Yeah.  Kids will do that, though.  I remember being a kid, and they used to sell what they called the candy cigarettes in the stores.  You go down there.  How the hell do they get away with that?  And it was in the little pack that looked like Marlboro, and it was candy, and there was a little red, like, paint at the tip of it.  Little tip.  Yeah.  And you'd be like, hey, look, I'm smoking like daddy. 
[01:50:00]  There was also later came gum, and if you actually blew out on the gum, do you remember this one?  Yeah.  It blew out on the gum, and it looked like smoke came out of it.  Yeah, because it was like some powdered sugar stuff would come flying out of it, and it would look like smoke.  But they pulled all that stuff off the market.  I've still seen candy cigarettes around.  Really?  Where?  To, like, Taiwan?  Where do you see that?  Where in America?  I bet it was down south.  No, actually, it was one of those trucks that have ice cream and candy and all that stuff. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah, the ice cream trucks, my friend.  Yeah.  Yes, my friend.  You get the candy cigarette, my friend.  Exactly.  Well, when does the movie come out?  Well, it's been out.  It's out.  It's out.  But they're expanding it to more theaters.  That's what they've got to do.  They do that little test run, do they?  They call it platforming.  Platforming.  There's a word for everything.  God damn it.  What do I know?  Platforming.  Platforming.  I just know, hey, wow, look, there's a cool movie in my theater.  I'm going to go see it.  I guess that's what they did with that basic instinct, too. 
[01:51:00]  They were platforming.  Yeah, I guess.  No one really wanted to see that for the second time around.  Man, I mean, how many years has it been between the two movies, right?  Leg crossings.  30.  Yeah.  And they blatantly were trying to, like, promote it that way, where they showed her cross the legs  and put a big, like, black box over her box.  That movie made $4.600 at the box office.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They said it averaged something like four people per theater. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  It's an intimate date movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  You could go in there and get away from everybody.  Yeah, because I really want to see Sharon Stone's 50-year-old pussy.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus.  Christ.  How about you make basic instinct, too, maybe two, three years later?  Yeah.  You wait two decades.  Gee, thanks. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Thanks for throwing us a bone.  Or recast it.  Or recast it.  Think her pussy tastes like an alligator's stomach?  Jesus.  You know, I've never tasted an alligator's stomach, but that's still funny.  I can only imagine.  You don't even need to imagine for some reason.  So you've got to go with this movie.  This isn't one of those movies that needs to be like this over-the-top, hundreds of millions  of dollars to be successful.  It's just got to be critically acclaimed.  You know? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, it's getting great reprieve.  You know, it speaks for itself.  It really is a fun movie.  And it works from the beginning to the end.  You walk in, you go, wow, that worked.  Yeah.  And people get it, because, yeah, I could just see some people that don't really get  it.  Right.  What is this?  There were some really, really funny scenes in this movie.  They're trying to brainwash me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You are a PG-13.  I'm not going in there.  They're going to try to make me smoke.  What rating did they give you guys?  A PG-13?  I think it's an R.  An R, really? 
[01:53:00]  Good.  Why?  Because of the subject matter?  I think because of the sex scenes.  Oh.  And doesn't she say, I want you inside me when I see you on TV?  Oh, the Katie Holmes scene.  Right.  Oh, right.  That was really good.  Yeah.  Dude, that was hilarious.  I forgot all about that until you just, I don't want to give it away.  Damn it.  I wonder what happened to her.  I want to talk about her.  Huh?  I wonder what happened to her.  Yeah, where'd she go?  You never hear about her anymore.  Do you really think she's pregnant? 
[01:53:30]  A lot of people don't think she's pregnant.  We all got to wait to see what's under that shirt.  Yeah.  Nice shirt.  Yeah.  L. Ron Hubbard's ashes.  They just ripped out pages of Dianetics and shoved it down her shirt.  You know, the scene with Katie Holmes is actually really funny because we could kind of relate  in a way.  Like, she's a reporter and she starts banging this guy.  So he's like, not because we banged reporters, by the way, but you'll understand what I'm 
[01:54:00]  getting at.  And I guess he assumed that they had something because they're having sex.  So he's telling her all this information, assuming it's, you know, it's off the record because  they're having sex, you know?  Yeah.  And we've been in positions with some of our friendly reporters like, ah, he can't possibly  screw us.  That's our pal.  Right.  So he's just yapping, yapping, yapping because he's having sex with her and she just puts  out an article and destroys the dude in the movie.  And he's all surprised, like, what? 
[01:54:30]  I thought we had something.  It was well, well done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  I encourage people to see this movie.  I really enjoyed it.  Right on.  And I liked you in 40-Year-Old Virgin and Anchorman, man.  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  Those were amazing.  40-Year-Old Virgin, I just did a day because Steve's a friend.  They called me and asked me if I want to come and do some of the movies.  I said, sure.  But Anchorman, man, that was fun every day.  Right.  So you got a Spike Lee thing going on with Steve Carell because I'm looking like you got 
[01:55:00]  all the shit he does.  So y'all got like that, hey, call Dave.  I've known him for 15 years.  He and I, his wife and I were on Saturday Night Live together.  I've known those guys since Chicago.  We were all at Second City at the same time.  Right.  What, any character we might know on SNL?  Did you have a character?  Do you remember T-Bones?  There's an extra sketch I did with Christopher Walken was hilarious.  Gerald T-Bones Timmons.  In fact, I got my own television show coming out this summer in August with Comedy Central 
[01:55:30]  based on that character.  Really?  The other ones I remember, the Fops or what else?  I did Pat Buchanan.  Oh, I remember that one.  I remember Donald's brother, Gary.  You still have to audition or you just get offers now?  That's how it is.  Oh, no.  I audition.  But you get offers, though, right?  Every once in a while.  You're an offer guy.  I feel it.  I know you're trying to keep humble.  I know you're trying to keep humble, but you're an offers guy.  I feel it.  I feel it.  I feel he gets offers. 
[01:56:00]  He's just trying to, like, that humble thing that we do, like, hey, we don't want to get  jinxed anything.  Oh, no.  I wish it was true.  Really?  Yeah.  That was, man.  Show business is a craggy mountain that everyone's crawling on all fours.  Patrice worked with Steve, right?  I did the office a few times.  Patrice has been in the office.  Yeah, David, Patrice O'Neill's in the studio.  He's been in the office.  He does WebJunk 20 for a few months.  Hey, look at his face, you motherfucker.  That's just like being in Thank You for Smoking, you know. 
[01:56:30]  I'm crawling through the quagmire.  Yeah, we're all on all fours over here, man.  The man that's on my neck and peeing in my mouth, motherfucker.  I'm making fun of you.  That would be a dream come true to host WebJunk 20.  We got all the rungs of the entertainment ladder talking at the same time right here.  I'm not even on the ladder yet, and I'm making fun of you.  I love it.  I love it.  David, they're telling us you got to go. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, man, thanks for having me.  Yeah, if you're ever in New York, come on by and say hi to us.  I will.  All right, David.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  Thank you for smoking.  It's going to be in theaters all over the place starting this weekend.  I love that they're telling us you got to go thing.  Yeah.  Like, do you think right now he's thinking, who told him anything?  I really think that's a genius thing, man.  Isn't that the best thing?  Because I called him one time, and you guys did, like, hey, tell us you got to go.  Hey, they're telling us you got to go.  It's so...  Patrice.  It's so funny. 
[01:57:30]  Like, at first, you're like, oh, yeah, okay.  And then you think, who's they?  I'm the only motherfucker here on the phone.  No, even better when they're in studio.  Yeah.  You look at them with a dead straight face, poker face, and go, hey, man, they're telling  us you got to go.  They're telling us you got to go.  We've seen...  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've seen guests look around like, who...  What?  Who's telling...  But they can't dispute it or anything.  And you don't change them.  And all you have to do is, like, do the hold your right ear thing with your hand.  Yeah, hold your ear.  Hey, tell us.  No, you don't even do that.  And you don't even change your poker face, and they're just, like... 
[01:58:00]  And they just get up all weird, like, and walk out.  It's so uncomfortable, but so much fun.  And you know they're down in the elevator just, who told them I got to go?  But I didn't tell you he's got to go.  I think that is really funny, man.  They're telling us.  Hey, this started off by...  I don't even know how this break started.  We've been on, like, an hour and a half easily.  Wow.  Maybe longer.  We had another sports clip.  That's what it was, from Brad in Chicago. 
[01:58:30]  Oh.  Right.  We did the sports clips.  God, that seems like years ago.  I had a second clip we were going to play, and then we went off on an hour tangent.  Certainly did.  So we should wrap up this break with another clip that Brad sent in.  It's Mark Grace.  Mark Grace...  Mark's great.  This is how it's in the email.  Mark Grace ripped a player while he was the Diamondbacks announcer, and not knowing he  was live on the air.  Oh.  Ouch. 
[01:59:00]  Nice grammar.  Here's the clip.  Here we get a look at Juan Encarnacion, who did major damage to the Diamondbacks in Phoenix  about a month ago.  Every fucking swing that guy takes is an underwater swing.  Snyder hit a fucking grand slam.  You know, A.J. Burnett, although he's never had the 114...  All right, you hear what's happening here?  How great is this?  This is a really good clip.  But what's happening?  Because he didn't explain it quite right in his email.  Here's what it sounds like. 
[01:59:30]  He's not in the booth with the announcers.  Obviously.  It sounds like, obviously, the announcers are in the booth.  They're calling the game.  This guy is somewhere else.  Has his mic on.  Well, you know how they mic the players.  They wire...  Yeah.  And then I think what they do is they warn the player, look, we're going to you.  Right.  It's a deal they make with Major League...  You know...  He's in the dugout.  He's in the dugout?  He's in the dugout.  Yeah, but, like, I mean, if you're going to be mic'd as a player, you've got to think  you're just going to start cursing.  So you've got to think someone is, from the broadcast, going, all right, we're going to  finally go to you, so keep it clean.  Right.  Yeah, they left his mic on.  And he's...  They left his mic on. 
[02:00:00]  It goes on.  And now the announcer, the guy in the booth...  He freaks.  ...is trying his best every time this guy starts talking and cursing to cover it up  with something that he can say loudly.  Yeah, you hear his voice get a little louder, like, oh!  You heard him chime in after he heard the first F-bomb.  The other guy's a player.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's not in the announcer's booth.  Now we understand what's going on.  I guess, like Ben said, he's in the dugout and he's mic'd.  And they're going to, you know, eventually play his audio, whatever.  And, well, this is what happened.  We're going to look at Juan Encarnacion, who did major damage to the Diamondbacks in Phoenix. 
[02:00:30]  Snyder, definitely.  About a month ago.  Every fucking swing that guy takes is an underwater swing.  Snyder hit a fucking grand slam off.  You know, A.J. Burnett, although he's never had the 114...  This guy can just slam off and get your fucking ass off.  But Burnett, one of those guys...  That's going to fucking matter.  Well, we understand we had some technical...  You know, I've got to go back again because...  Oh, that was great. 
[02:01:00]  Who is that, by the way?  It's one of the...  It's one of...  It's Buck...  What the hell is his name?  Ben, help me out again.  Where's Earl?  No, what the...  It's one of the most, you know, famous baseball announcers.  What the hell is his name again?  Whatever.  But he's...  It's Joe Buck.  It is Joe Buck, right?  Joe Buck.  Okay.  I think it is.  It sounds like Joe Buck.  Joe Buck.  Anyway, he's trying to cover by saying something.  Yeah.  Did you notice that he stops because he doesn't actually have anything?  No, he's got nothing to say. 
[02:01:30]  And he's probably looking around at people going, like, what...  You know, mouthing, what the fuck is going on?  Right.  We're going to look at Juan Encarnacion, who did major damage to the Diamondbacks in Phoenix.  Snyder definitely.  About a month ago.  Every fucking swing that guy takes is an underwater swing.  Snyder hit a fucking grand slam.  You know, A.J. Burnett, although he's never had the 1.14.  This guy can go slam off and get your fucking... 
[02:02:00]  But Burnett, one of those guys where you...  Where are you?  My gut's going to fucking matter.  Well, we understand we had some technical problems a little bit earlier on tonight in the telecast.  And maybe there were a few things that, to be quite honest with you, we certainly wish you did not hear at home.  And we would like to send out our apologies.  And if any of you were offended, we sincerely and deeply apologize.  There's a happy young fan. 
[02:02:30]  Dude, do you...  Can you imagine?  I feel that he was...  Not only was that fucked up to hear for the guy announcing, but you know there was a guy talking that he was talking to that was uncomfortable.  That was an uncomfortable conversation, just man to man, like, this fucking guy.  And then you can picture the guy next to him, because there's no sound from the other guy going,  Yeah, he's a dick.  He's just going,  Yeah, cool, man.  And he's like, this fucking guy sucks. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  Every swing he takes is a fucking underwater swing.  Oh, fuck.  Just one of those guys that you're like, get the fuck away from me, dude.  Yeah, right.  You know what, though?  It just shows you, though.  Why not just throw it all out there?  Why is it such a problem to hear that word?  Because apparently it's being used everywhere all the time.  Who are we kidding?  Who are we kidding?  For some reason, TV and radio, it has become a place, it's about the only place. 
[02:03:30]  You can't use those words, because they fear that when people hear it, they're going to be offended.  But you hear it everywhere.  Who are we kidding?  We've got to give up on the F word.  202, right?  Open Anthony Station.  Yeah.  Ready?  Mm-hmm.  Uncensored Sports Announcing.  Make a deal for 202.  Oh, would that be great?  Sports Announcing XL.  Look at this fucking non-jumping faggot.  That would be awesome.  Nigga, this nigga can't shoot. 
[02:04:00]  The fuck you doing?  Holy shit, he hit that ball like a wife who doesn't listen.  That thing is gone.  Wow, he smacked that motherfucker.  Right over the wall.  What?  The 202 game.  There you go.  I don't even want no money.  If it's high and wide for ball four, he's walked two in a row now.  They've got to take this fucking asshole out of here.  He's stinking up the whole fucking joint.  Fucking dick.  We'll be back after this word from nobody. 
[02:04:30]  We have no sponsors.  Because we say fuck all the time.  This faggot just got off a rotator cuff.  What the fuck is a rotator cuff, you faggot?  Walk it off, dick.  I want ghetto announcing, though.  That's even better.  NBA ghetto announcing.  Start there.  Instead of these white boys announcing the NBA games.  I've got to watch this nigga shoot free throws.  Bring these bitches out and dance.  Fuck this hoe in her mouth.  Yeah, dunk it, motherfucker. 
[02:05:00]  Damn, that white boy can dunk.  Ghetto announcing.  Now, see, that's something that would fly.  We've got info on that clip, by the way.  Jason in Arizona.  Jason.  Hey.  Yeah, the announcer, that's Tom Brenovan.  He does the TV side.  Okay, I'm sorry.  They all sound like Joe Buck to me.  Yeah, and the funny thing is, because that was when Mark Grace was an actual player,  and then now he doesn't play no more.  But he does the TV side now with that guy, Tom Brenovan.  How great is that? 
[02:05:30]  Very cool.  All right, punch it out.  Thanks, Jason.  So, and of course, we could finish up with the latest John Sterling call.  Now, the 2-2.  Swung on.  Hit in the air to deep right.  If it stays fair, it's gone.  It is gone.  Upper deck.  A three-run home run for Johnny Damon.  Positively demonic.  He hits a three-run home run. 
[02:06:00]  In the first row of the upper deck near the foul ball.  That blows it wide open.  And the Yankees have a 9-2 lead.  That's the best he could come up with for Johnny Damon.  Demonic.  You're going to have to hear demonic all year long, you Yankees fans.  Demonic.  Oh, boy.  Demonic.  It's going to be a long season if you've got to listen to that crap.  But Giambino was bad.  And he couldn't even really sell it.  Nah, he's still working on something for Johnny Damon. 
[02:06:30]  He's like, I'll try the demonic.  I don't know if it's going to fly.  What's the Asian guy that he got sold for him?  I don't know.  What's that guy's name?  The best is the Giambino.  The Giambino.  The Giambino.  Whatever.  An A-bomb by A-Rod.  Shut up.  Jimmy fucking hates it.  I can't wait to tell Jimmy what he's got for Johnny Damon.  What do we got?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's nice.  Thanks, E-Rock. 
[02:07:00]  I don't need it, though.  It's E-Rock.  E-Rock.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  We have audio of DEA, who's suing.  We started that an hour ago.  Good.  I want to hear that.  Yo, Mama Clips from MTV.  Yeah, I want to hear about this thing.  I haven't seen the show, but I heard it really stinks.  I hate it.  I hate it.  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Hi, Ma.  Ma, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too. 
[02:07:30]  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Whew.  Finally.  Being an intern for the Opie and Anthony radio show can be a worthwhile experience if you  follow these simple guidelines.  First, you must adhere to the company dress code.  You could wear either garters or bong panties.  When working in close quarters with others for extended periods of time, personal hygiene 
[02:08:00]  is also very important.  You will shave every third day, which includes legs and pubic area, navel to anus.  Conduct in studio and on air is also of critical importance.  You will be naked within 20 minutes and then sleep naked unless otherwise instructed.  On occasion, interns will need to cater to very specific needs of the radio show hosts.  You will perform any and all sexual acts, including anal penetration and or ingestion of  cum when told to. 
[02:08:30]  Interns looking for additional credit are encouraged to go the extra mile.  Sex acts can include, but are not limited to, stripping, handjobs, fingering, masturbation,  dildoing, vibrators, and object insertion.  All application of lubes to myself, you, or any object will be done by you.  Of course, it's important to maintain a positive attitude despite any objection you may have  to these requests.  You will not cry, sob, whine, or otherwise show displeasure or unhappiness.  Non-compliance with a host's request will be dealt with effectively and immediately. 
[02:09:00]  If you are non-compliant, you will be tied to the bed and I will do whatever I wish to  you.  So if you think you have what it takes to be an Opie and Anthony show intern, look for  details on opieandanthony.com.  I can cuddle, spoon, hold, or touch you in any way.  What is fucking wrong with this?  She's a woman, you know what I mean.  You better listen, listen to me.  She's gonna set you free. 
[02:09:30]  Nice.  Wolf mother, right?  Thank you, Steve.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  We're heading to Boston.  We're gonna be live Monday.  My neck of the woods.  At Phil's Bar on Lansdowne Street.  Marathon Monday, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.  That's the broadcast on Monday.  Fun, fun, fun. 
[02:10:00]  What do you want to do next?  I don't know.  Patrice was just trying to make hookups on Pal Talk during the commercial break.  He's so funny.  He wants, you know, he wants to bring another girl in.  So he kind of starts soliciting some of the girls that are up on the screen.  And you, I mean.  And we're just cock-blocking.  Yeah, it's just full of cock-blocks.  Just cock-blocking.  It's cock-block talk.  Cock-block talk.  Don't let him do it, man.  No.  Stay away from him.  They cut off our typing privileges.  Yeah.  Don't answer him, man. 
[02:10:30]  Look at those sexy tits.  Oh, it makes me sick.  Just look at that, man.  That's fucking amazing, dude.  What is this?  The fucking, um, his complaint.  Oh, the G-E-A-A.  That is genius.  Uh, the G-E-A-A-J?  I got this, man.  You motherfuckers do good work.  Fucking well.  I can't believe I'm looking at the goddamn complaint.  That's genius.  And it's highlighted.  I can tell this was highlighted by a tiny, frail hand.  Wasn't it?  No?  Oh, shit. 
[02:11:00]  What?  Right there.  Look at the plate.  They got web junk 20s.  It's in a complaint.  Come on.  Get the fuck out.  Oh, fuck.  You're getting your ass too, bro.  Oh, damn.  Patrice O'Neal.  For example, the videotape of the accidental discharge has been broadcast.  Enter Alia?  Uh, that probably means without their permission.  Um, inter-al-ia. 
[02:11:30]  Ad nauseum.  Enter, uh...  What page of the complaint?  Uh, page four.  They underlined it.  I just saw it because they underlined it.  Page four.  The videotape of the accidental discharge has been broadcast.  Uh, inter-al-ia.  Oh, yeah.  On the Jay Leno show, A Current Affair, Jimmy Kimball, live, CNN Headline News, CNN News, Fox News, and VH1 show, Web Junk 20. 
[02:12:00]  Web Junk 20 in a complaint, baby.  It says, Regarding Volume 1, Stupid Cops.  Oh, they're going after your ass.  Oh, you are done.  And I called him an asshole.  I said, this asshole shoots himself in.  We had a nice...  We had...  Everybody else was going, oh, this was a dangerous situation.  We were like, this dumb motherfucker shot himself in the toe.  Your clip is going to be played in this courtroom.  You going, this asshole.  They're going to stop it with you right there, freeze-frame. 
[02:12:30]  And they're going to go, this man is calling our client an asshole based on this case.  And CNN's going to jump all over that.  We didn't take this lawsuit seriously until we saw this particular clip.  This man's an asshole.  Patrice O'Neal.  That motherfucker playing professional football.  He's a...  Yeah.  It goes on to say, typically, the videotape of the accidental discharge has been broadcast,  presented, or disclosed to others for purposes of amusement and to demean and to ridicule 
[02:13:00]  Mr. Page.  Boom.  Hmm.  So we're obviously talking about the accidental shooting in the classroom with the...  That's the actual law affidavit right there, isn't it?  Fucking amazing.  That's it.  We got audio.  Let's see if it mentions WebJunk 20.  I'm going to kill that fat motherfucker when I see him.  This is the DEA agent who shot himself on the Today Show only about an hour or so ago.  Well, that would have been perfect.  Yeah, you sold that nice soap.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, Hawk.  Hawk, what did you do?  Let's see.  Let's see what happens.  Yeah.  Usually, it's good to play the audio clip after the big setup.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's trying for a third time.  Go ahead, Hawk.  Third time's a charm.  It ain't happening.  You got it.  You got it.  It ain't happening.  This is it.  This will work.  Oh, boy.  Nothing.  Yeah.  He's pointing.  Everyone's pointing at Thane?  They're pointing at Derek.  No, not Derek. 
[02:14:00]  Derek just held up two fingers.  They're pointing at Thane.  It can't be.  It can't be.  No, no.  It can't be.  No.  It can't be.  Oh, no, Thane.  No, no.  Was he the last suspect?  Not two days in a row.  He was the last suspect.  It can't be.  Yesterday, he bombed on a joke.  And today, he fucked up one of the...  No, he's getting his back because we set him up yesterday to bomb on a joke.  Oh, is that it?  Absolutely.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Eat that.  Any circus tumbling humor you want to... 
[02:14:30]  I got five more minutes, huh?  Oh, boy.  I'll try to re-burn that, sir.  Yeah.  Let's get ready to humble.  Oh, very good.  Very good.  That's pretty funny.  The fucking look.  The fucking look.  That ran right into it, too.  Let's get ready to humble.  That fucking look he just gave me, though, man.  Oh, man.  All right.  What can we do?  Look at how we'll just go on to something else because that's what we do.  We're adaptable. 
[02:15:00]  Barely.  Yo, Mama.  Yeah.  Let's hear some of the Yo, Mama.  Are you into the Yo, Mama on MTV?  I watched seven seconds of an episode, and I threw up and then turned it off.  They're doing Yo, Mama.  And they already did this show, by the way, on...  It was a show right...  It came on like a year or two right after Def Comedy Jam was on.  Yeah.  It was already on HBO.  Snaps or something.  HBO Snaps.  Yeah.  HBO Snaps. 
[02:15:30]  Already.  This show is this.  I bet you this show's killing the radio.  It was 15 years ago.  And MTV bleeped out the word midget.  Midget.  They're doing crazy Mama jokes, and they're bleeping out the word midget.  Midget.  Because it's offensive.  It is what you are.  You're a midget.  That's all...  They're little people, and that's...  No, little people are regular motherfuckers who are small.  What you have is midgetitis.  Oh, someone's calling me dumb.  I think we were speculating, right? 
[02:16:00]  Rob?  Yeah, man.  Hey, why am I dumb today?  Oh, all right.  This guy's going to explain why you're dumb.  Yeah.  You stupid motherfucker.  You're on the air, idiot.  Speak.  Oh, what's up?  Hey, hey, how you doing?  All right, smarty pants.  Doesn't that fuck up your whole phone call if you're calling to say I'm dumb?  All right, punch it out.  No, no.  No, because now I need to know.  Now you have to.  Interalia is a legal term.  It means including but not limited to, or like among other things. 
[02:16:30]  Okay.  It has nothing to do with permission.  He didn't say we knew.  If you're calling me dumb because I didn't know what that is, that's fine.  I'm a dummy.  And I wanted to call you out because, you know, you guys always said it here on the microphone.  It must be the truth.  You were wrong today.  Rob.  Yeah.  I was kind of doing like a butthead, Beavis and Butthead thing, like, and playing dumb.  I think it means.  I've never seen that word in print before in my life.  I don't care to see it ever again.  And if I'm dumb because I don't know what that means, then so be it. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, smarty pants.  You go to Hofstra, huh?  Yeah.  Nuff said.  Nuff said.  Nuff said.  Nuff said.  Hofstra.  What, are you going to Hofstra law?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a great legal.  All the legal minds come out of Hofstra law.  Ha, ha.  And Anthony didn't even graduate high school.  How does that make you feel?  That's right.  And I know that Hofstra ain't worth a shit.  You didn't graduate high school?  He didn't.  He didn't.  Travis.  He didn't.  He too.  That's why he's smart now.  Travis goes to Hofstra, went to Hofstra. 
[02:17:30]  It's all unfolding.  I'm going to know the entire Anthony story by 2016.  No graduating for me.  I was too busy.  He didn't.  Need to.  What was high school we're going to get in?  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right, counselor.  Yes, then.  Oh.  Well, just thanks, man.  Wow.  Now we can go to either thing.  What are you doing with that, like, look now?  Let's go with your mama.  Beard?  I don't need to change.  Thanks.  Bill, the intern, his beard. 
[02:18:00]  But now that the hair has really gotten low into your eyes, you're starting to look like  Paul McCartney.  Like, you're doing something like, yeah.  Remember when Paul McCartney just, like, right after the Beatles broke up?  You shouldn't get him a Sgt. Pepper jacket.  He was, like, singing Let It Be.  Oh, my God.  He's got some.  There's almost some kind of a Chekhov hairdo going on.  Oh, yeah.  I guess I could see that.  Yeah, like, it's really.  Wow.  You're a hairy guy. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, I was going to shake my beard after this weekend, but.  No, don't do that.  Keep it going.  He's trying to get, like, downtown heroin pussy.  Is that it?  Greenwich Village heroin bitches with the super, the, what's that, the fucking dog, underdog  lunchboxes they walk around with their makeup in.  And the Che Guerrero jackets.  And that's who he's trying to fuck now.  Down in Ribbington.  Up on Delancey off of Minus 47th Street and shit.  This motherfucker.  Minus 47th Street. 
[02:19:00]  That's really funny.  You're living in Manhattan.  Right?  No, right?  That's really funny.  Like, where the fuck am I?  I'm at Minus 47th Street.  We don't know what's down this far.  You're trying to fuck junkie bitches.  Well, good luck to you.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go back to the DEA.  DEA agent who shot himself.  He talked on the Today Show.  It works.  Here's so much for timing. 
[02:19:30]  I hope it works.  50 cent, too short.  All of them talk about Glock 40.  Okay?  I'm the only one in this room, professional enough, that I know of and care of this Glock 40.  I'm the only one.  Now, that happened two years ago.  But now, Lee Page, the agent you're seeing, is suing the federal government  because the video somehow hit the internet, even though it was part of an internal DEA investigation.  The second, the best part, he's like, I'm the only one that is professional enough or whatever he's saying. 
[02:20:00]  You see, you know.  And then, bam, right after that.  Who's he say talks about the Glock?  Uh, 50 cent.  Your 50 talks about the Glock.  Chick, chick.  But, um, though, apparently, he, uh, he puts one in the chamber and then drops the clip.  Dude, this could wreck your career.  Which is really not what you're supposed to do.  This could wreck the Web Junk 20 career of Patrice O'Neal.  Oh, they're going to run scared.  Mm-mm.  No?  No? 
[02:20:30]  All right, guys.  That's why I'm there to cover him.  Ah.  Oh, never.  No.  It's going to turn up in the, uh...  Is it lunchtime?  In the court case, though.  For Patrice, it is.  Yeah, for me, I'm starving.  What'd you get, chicken cutlet?  Chicken salad.  All right.  Chicken salad.  Listen, uh...  He can't win this, by the way.  People cover themselves.  People cover themselves too much.  Like, the goofy show I do, they just...  The lawyers cover themselves.  Yeah.  There's an...  He can't win.  He's saying because it was part of a DEA investigation. 
[02:21:00]  It was part of an investigation after he did it, I'm sure.  When it first happened, or if that thing had gone off without a hitch like that, that  tape would have ended up where?  They sent it to other schools or something, maybe?  Yeah, who was filming this?  The school itself?  Just the school to, you know...  All right, let's, uh...  Put it in their video yearbook.  This is where he explains why he's suing.  As we heard on the tape, you said, I'm the only one professional enough to handle the  weapon, and then, bang, the gun discharged.  How could this have happened? 
[02:21:30]  Well, I accidentally, basically had an accidental discharge.  I cleared the weapon and then omitted to release the magazine.  When I let the slide forward, it seated another round in the magazine.  I was at the point of attempting to demonstrate how the gun could be disassembled and put back  together.  And it's something that I had done hundreds of times throughout my career.  And I had an honest mistake.  And basically what happened is I shot myself. 
[02:22:00]  He's got a suit.  He's looking for a paycheck.  Someone got in his head and said, you know what, man?  We can make some money off this.  Like, what happened?  I fucked up would be the answer, because that's what he did.  Clears the weapon and then pops the magazine out.  Patrick in Ohio.  Patrick?  Yeah, I got the exact same gun.  It's a Glock 23.  It's .40 caliber.  It's, like, extremely difficult to make that gun go off on accident, for one, because, like, 
[02:22:30]  you always know if one's in the chamber, because if one is not in the chamber, the trigger  will be suppressed.  It'll be, like, back against the...  I don't know, they'll be back against the...  Back of the trigger guard.  Yeah, it'll be back against the trigger guard.  But secondly, on a Glock, on his model, your finger has to be, like, dead on the trigger,  because in the middle, there's, like, a little...  It's, like, a little clip, and if you don't have your finger on that, that is the safety. 
[02:23:00]  Like, if you don't have your finger square on the trigger, it will not go off.  Yeah, you can't put your finger on the very tip of the trigger and pull it.  Yeah, because on the side, it's, like, hard, but in the middle, it's, like, a little plastic.  He just, he wanted to release the hammer, is what he did, and...  But his hammer on that gun is internal.  Yeah, no, I know, I know, it's an automatic.  He wanted to release it, so he just pulled the trigger, thinking that the gun was clear,  when, you know, obviously, ha-ha, oops. 
[02:23:30]  Can a gun malfunction?  Yeah, when a person fucking malfunctions.  I mean, they can't do something and fire itself when it clicks.  You know, I would love to know how many times a gun has malfunctioned and gone off  without it being some type of human error, because it's usually somebody being careful.  That guy was being so fucking careless right there.  A room full of kids.  When you clear your clip, I don't care if you, no, you open it up,  and you visually look and see if anything's in there, 
[02:24:00]  and then you still don't fucking fire it off.  And now this guy is suing?  Yeah.  I swear, man, the kid should sue him.  Yeah, the kid's probably got a good case.  The kid should sue him.  I was traumatized.  Yeah, of trauma.  But they'll sue the DEA also.  Yeah.  I would sue that guy personally going,  look, man, my kid was in that classroom, man,  and now he's scared that he's going to be shot just walking down the street.  That's the Brandon Lee thing.  What the fuck happened?  That's why, you know, if you,  they don't fuck around with water guns on sets,  because that shit happened to Brandon Lee's son. 
[02:24:30]  That's how he died.  John Eric Hexum.  Remember John Eric Hexum?  He was a guy who was on this TV series,  and he was fucking around with a gun.  There was a blanket around in it,  and he put it up against his head and pulled the trigger.  Now, even though there's no bullet,  you are then, what he in essence did was use a piece of his skull as the projectile,  because you're still getting the energy that would normally push a bullet out.  Oh, wow.  So it hit the side of his head and put a piece of his skull right into his brain. 
[02:25:00]  Bye-bye.  Dead.  This is a stage prop gun.  Dead.  Oh, sure.  Let's go to Dan in Philly.  Dan?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  I own a Glock 2340 cal pistol,  and it's a lot easier than you think to accidentally discharge the gun.  I mean, that trigger guard safety is nothing,  and what the guy did was just drop another bullet into the chamber,  and when he went to put it on his side, pulled the trigger, period. 
[02:25:30]  That's it.  Very stupid move, but you know what I mean?  It's a lot easier than people think.  Wow.  Thank you, Dan.  I stink.  Sorry.  No, that was fine.  Let's get more audio here.  It's impact of the tape, what it's done to him personally.  All right.  So this tape, then, shot by someone in the room, was turned over to the DEA.  They used it in an internal investigation.  I understand you were eventually suspended without pay for about five days,  but then somehow this tape ended up on the Internet.  How do you say that's impacted your life and your career? 
[02:26:00]  Well, basically...  Patrice, call me asshole.  The majority of my time as a special agent with DEA, I spent a lot of time working undercover.  I also was a demand reduction collateral duty.  One of my collateral duties was a demand reduction agent where I went out and spoke to civic organizations,  professional teams, nursing homes, doctors, lawyers, the whole nine yards,  and had aspirations of doing something at the end of my career, 
[02:26:30]  and it's probably going to be hard now since throughout the world this video had been shown.  And thank God it's going to be hard.  What are you doing with a loaded gun in a classroom?  What are you doing with a loaded gun in a classroom?  A little demonstration.  Imagine if you shot one of those kids, man.  Oh, that would have made a great tape for WebJunk 20, right?  How come it's okay if he shoots himself, but shooting one of the kids, you never would have played it. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Ziggy?  Never would have seen that.  Ziggy, what's up?  Hey.  I just wanted to chime in, man.  I spent six years in the Marine Corps, and my brother's a cop.  My best friend's a cop.  And the first rule of any weapon is you treat it as if it was loaded or not.  I don't care if you have a magazine in the ground, any stuff like that, man.  This guy, especially in a classroom with kids, I just don't see how anybody could be that stupid.  In that environment, with kids in a classroom, wouldn't you, like, quadruple check everything? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  I know when we were in the Marine Corps, you know, you'd have the little dog and pony shows  where people would come and look at weapons.  You can't just how many times you went over that just checking the chamber.  First of all, there's no reason to come in there with a loaded magazine.  Like, the weapon should have been cleared before he even...  He wanted to be, like, 50 cent.  He wanted to be cool.  Right.  He wanted to look like a gangster thug in front of the kids.  Exactly.  Like a hard ass.  There was no reason to have ammo on himself when he went into that classroom. 
[02:28:00]  He could have done the whole demonstration with just the magazine and the gun.  All right.  You're damn right.  Punch down, guys.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's see.  Let's go down to Mark in Connecticut.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You guys sort of stole my thunder here, but I'm surprised this guy has still got a job.  And if he was so concerned about his undercover stuff, why is he doing all this talk show crap?  Yeah.  Yeah, now he's in public on all the talk shows because he's sewing. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Well, and that, like, you stole my thunder saying, what if you pop one of the guys in the class?  But I sell, like, 15 blocks a week at the shop that I work at.  And some of the cops that I sell to are the scariest guys I sell them to.  The way they finger the gun and don't know what the hell they're doing with it.  Horrible.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Someone's suggesting there was more firepower with the students.  So if he shot one of the kids, he'd have been shot by half the class.  That's why he calmed down the kids right away.  Yeah.  He was like, oh, my God. 
[02:29:00]  Don't shoot, kids.  Don't shoot.  Anyone carry in this classroom?  Matthew in Vegas, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  I worked at a secret test site, and we had to watch this as a training video.  And if you see what the guy did, is he actually racks the slide bag to clear it with the magazine still in  and drives the slide forward with the magazine in the gun.  Yeah.  If he would have popped the magazine, even if there was one in the chamber,  if he would have then racked it, it would have popped out the live round and it would have been empty. 
[02:29:30]  But he racks it with the clip in, so then, hey, you got yourself a loaded gun.  What an asshole.  All right, Matthew, thank you.  Watch it out.  My famous story, when I saw that kid get shot out there in the desert, that was one of those guns.  It was just an awful old six-shooter, had barely no safety on it.  He had a quarter-cocked this gun to load it to spin the chamber, and it was his father.  We're out there just fucking around, and the father brings the gun up. 
[02:30:00]  It's loaded, quarter-cocked.  His finger must have been on the trigger.  Hit the round, boom, right through his son's shoulder.  Looked like it went right through his chest, but it hit his shoulder-chest area.  And the kid's face just kind of looked at his father and just was like,  You shot me.  Boom, down he went.  Sprayed like a fountain right out of him.  And we were all sitting there like, holy shit.  But it's pretty fucked up why someone gets shot.  Pretty cool, actually.  If you really don't care about the person that much. 
[02:30:30]  Here's one more clip.  So clearly there's been some pain and suffering, I would imagine, emotionally on your part.  Well, certainly, you know, I'm inclined to say that I've dealt with it from colleagues, state and local colleagues,  as well as the general public in airports.  Yesterday I walked into a salon, and a young lady made mention to me that I was a person that shot myself on TV.  So it's something that I can't get away from. 
[02:31:00]  I made an honest mistake during the course of this sensitive investigation.  Sensitive material was leaked, and it's caused me a great deal of embarrassment and a lot of stress, basically, on my family and friends.  How about cutting off your dreads?  Like, if he just gave himself a haircut, no one would recognize him.  He can't really tell what he looks like that well.  It's a grainy internet video. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, who's going to say, oh, I know you.  You're the guy that shot yourself.  Yeah.  Hmm.  So there you go.  Good luck.  And there's a, God, there's a ton of people that want in on this.  Matt in Pennsylvania.  Matt.  Hey, what's this?  Professor Anthony's supposed to know a little bit about everything.  Yeah.  Dogs don't have hammers.  No, I didn't mean a hammer like in a revolver.  But that's what you said.  Whatever the name, what's the name of the thing that hits the fucking firing pin mechanism then? 
[02:32:00]  Could you help me out?  Help me out of here, Henry.  I'm pretty sure it's called a drop pin.  What's it called?  Drop pin.  It's a drop pin.  Drop pin?  Drop pin.  The drop pin comes down and then it lets the firing pin come front.  There is something that, on the slide, that strikes the firing pin, that gives it the pressure that hits the primer.  What's it called?  What's it fucking called?  I don't remember.  All right, asshole.  Call me when you know. 
[02:32:30]  I know it's not a hammer technically, but that's what, whatever it is that strikes the firing pin.  Let's go to Glenn in Connecticut.  Glenn.  I don't own a Glock.  Jesus.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got two things.  First off, I'm in the Army, so the first thing that happens when you get your rifle is they always tell you to index your finger,  which means never put your finger on the trigger.  So technically you can never accidentally discharge a weapon if your finger's not on the trigger. 
[02:33:00]  And then the second thing is if he was going to take apart the weapon and he's trying to clear it,  the first thing you do is you take the magazine out.  You don't clear it and then have the magazine still in.  You said another round's going to go in the chamber.  You're just, that's called loading it.  That's called getting it ready to go.  Hey, so.  Chambering around.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Anthony, so if you, while you're watching this, right, if it didn't go off, like hindsight,  would anybody, any of these people who are calling out, would they have looked at that video and been like, 
[02:33:30]  what's this fucking stupid motherfucker doing?  Yeah, and probably a few people would have been like, oh my God.  Even before he shot himself, like, what the fuck is this guy doing?  He just chambered around.  Sorry.  We get distracted easily on this program.  I'm sorry.  Don't do this to me.  Oh, shit.  Hidden talents.  Fables from the disabled.  Fables from the disabled. 
[02:34:00]  Don't do this to me.  And I guess it's disabled people that do arts and crafts.  Oh, my God.  I made a pillow.  Oh, boy.  P-I-W-O-W.  Oh, look.  Look at that.  One goat's looking one way.  One's looking the other.  Zeeb in the middle going, what do you want from me?  What do you want from me?  Hey, he painted that.  Hey, the painting looks better than their DNA. 
[02:34:30]  Look like.  One goat's looking the other way.  What do you want?  What do you want from me?  What do you want from me?  Oh, man.  It looks familiar.  Yes, and had this serious interview.  And Carrie sitting there on the couch having this serious interview.  So, what does this do for their self-esteem?  This really.  Oh, my God.  Look at the glass.  Are we getting this audio?  Is that a guy?  I can't tell. 
[02:35:00]  Is that a guy or a girl?  It looks like Truman Capote.  That is a woman?  That is the cruelest thing.  Oh, God, no.  Our Lord is a cruel Lord.  Why would.  Why would.  That looks like a man woman.  And it's middle age.  So, it just.  Yeah.  It lived.  You don't know what it is.  It just lived.  I swear to you, I could not tell what that was. 
[02:35:30]  It looked like the little guy that sat on top of that guy's back in.  Master Blaster.  In.  Isn't that humongous?  Yeah.  From Mad Max?  No, it's Master Blaster from Thunderdome.  Master Blaster.  Master Blaster.  Master Blaster.  Sounds like.  I sent him back and I said, you know what?  I'm sorry, but you have to do it differently.  But thank you for the job that you tried to do.  And I kept sending it back to him.  And he says, I'm just as disabled.  I'm just as disabled as you guys. 
[02:36:00]  And we all clapped and said, welcome to the family, Sean.  Well, that's cool.  Who'll run barter town?  He was a lovely, lovely person to know.  Well, he actually wrote the foreword to this book.  Master Blaster.  Master Blaster.  Thank you so much for joining us and best wishes on this book and also these other items  which you can find out about on our website if you'd like.  End embargo.  Disabled Fables.  That will sell six books.  It will be, let me tell you what that book will be. 
[02:36:30]  This book will be when you're walking downtown and there's a homeless guy who just has a bunch  of books.  It will be right next to like Beatles, unknown Beatle collection.  In between a Superman 3 and a fucking, and that letter F on the encyclopedia.  On a table.  Those book guys stink.  It will be a chewed up Superman 3. 
[02:37:00]  And then disabled Fables in the middle.  Those awful books.  A Da Vinci Code that's missing 100 pages.  And then you, that's the book you use to sign your credit card.  You take credit cards?  Let me sign it on Disabled Fables.  Could you go get the audio of that?  No, maybe we should.  Oh, shit.  You know what I hear?  Can I hear that man, woman?  Oh, man. 
[02:37:30]  Jesus.  It's a tough old world, man.  Once upon a time.  This fucking world stinks.  You know somebody wrote that too?  You know they were just going, they were just going, meh.  And somebody was going, what do you want to say?  Meh.  Once upon a time.  Okay, go.  Meh.  There was a goat.  Who had what?  A kangaroo as a friend.  Me. 
[02:38:00]  And then that goat put on some pants.  Is that what you said?  And at the end.  That's the co-author.  At the end, the author of the picture is just a hand with paint on it.  Me.  Hey, this is.  No, that's what he does at the book signing.  At the book signing.  I loved your book.  He said, thank you. 
[02:38:30]  Written by, and then they have the author, as told by.  As told by.  You know, it's like when the sports guy writes a book.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, sure he did.  Oh, that's so fucked up.  As told to.  Sure, Patrick Ewing actually wrote this.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, you're kidding.  That was Patrick Ewing when I was doing this.  That's why.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, someone's saying it's a striker.  Someone's saying it's a hammer.  So now, whatever.  Ah.  You know what?  We don't care. 
[02:39:00]  We don't have to answer every question.  You need the technical name for everything, my friend.  Can we break before Yo Mama Audio?  All right.  No.  Oh.  He's in the ranks.  Who's angered by that?  Is there a reason why we have to break?  Yeah, yeah.  Behind?  I heard that.  Let's do this heist thing real fast, and then we'll break.  I can hear you.  Rashad wrote Steve at foundrymusic.com. 
[02:39:30]  We're getting a lot of participation from the listeners lately.  Yes.  A lot of people sending us stuff.  We appreciate that.  It helps the show greatly.  Still looking for news teases from the rest of the country, by the way.  Those ridiculous, scary news teases.  You can send those in as well.  Rashad writes, I was watching the show Heist on NBC, where I noticed some beautiful statements  being made by an Irish cop to his black partner.  I have not laughed harder at network TV dialogue.  In the first clip, the two guys, who don't particularly care for each other, are just 
[02:40:00]  bantering in the station before a meeting.  In the second clip, they are doing a stakeout, and Billy asks a perfectly reasonable question.  I think it's great that network TV is finally showing a little bit of gumption by leaving  that kind of dialogue in.  Then again, NBC is in fourth place.  Ah, yes.  So Irish cop, black partner, and Rashad thought this was so funny that he needed to send this  sentence today.  Let's take a listen to the first clip.  I'm just saying, your people don't make good quarterbacks. 
[02:40:30]  What?  Your people.  Patrice, you better put your headphones on.  Your people.  I can hear it.  Oh, you can hear that?  Yeah, but I can hear it also.  I can hear it also.  Oh, I didn't know you...  Because you might have a comment here.  Your people.  I'm just saying, your people don't make good quarterbacks.  What?  Your people.  They don't make good quarterbacks.  Now you're an idiot and a racist.  Vic, McNabb, Culpeper, McNair.  How would you feel if I said all Irish people were drunks?  Well, we have to be to put up with the blacks.  What'd you say? 
[02:41:00]  I'm sorry, African Americans.  Should have used the N-word.  That's what...  That would have made it real.  That was actually pretty good, the dialogue.  That was pretty fun, actually.  Not bad.  I mean, they gave the white guy a little more cleverness, and he was dumb at the same  time, but he was more clever than the black.  Yeah.  But that was funny, but, you know, it was like, oh, how would you think if we called  all Irish people drunks? 
[02:41:30]  Drunk.  Like, he could have been way funnier than that.  Yeah.  But, you know, they wrote it for the dumb white guy to be clever, but it was pretty  funny, though, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Here's the second clip.  So you're saying niggas with an A-Z is acceptable, but...  Don't say it.  That word with an E-R is offensive.  Yes, fool, they're both offensive.  Just like Cracker with an A and Honky with two E's.  Now, why can't you just call a brother by his name? 
[02:42:00]  Why's it got to be I have this black friend on my African American partner?  You can just say, this is my friend Tyrese, and believe me, people will see that I'm black.  So you're saying we're friends?  No.  No, I'm not saying I was just using that as an example, if we were friends.  Well, if we were, what would I be?  Your partner, your co-worker, or a nigger with an A that took a bullet for you?  Didn't I just tell you not?  Hey, hey, hey, here it comes.  What show is this? 
[02:42:30]  It's called Heist.  That's pretty brave TV, but...  I thought it's called 48 Hours.  Yeah.  Is that the one on FX?  Sorry about you, nigger, watermelon.  NBC.  On NBC?  But they copped out because the white guy should have said, you know, the N-word.  Because his character would obviously say it, but the black guy's like, don't say it, don't  say it.  That's like so not irreverent, but it is for NBC, so you go, whoa.  But it's really not.  No.  It isn't.  Because Sopranos probably did that scene 10 years ago, and it was ridiculous. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Oh, and the discussion, the show has been canceled.  Oh.  Heist is canceled?  There you go.  Oh, well, what are you going to do?  They trying, though.  NBC's trying.  I didn't know they were fourth.  What the fuck do you mean fourth?  How do you beat both of them?  Below Fox?  Fox?  Fox is rocking.  They beating...  Fox is beating NBC?  Fox is rocking.  Oh, my God.  Idle and 24.  Oh, I know Zuppie's over there with a bullet in his mouth.  And, of course, House. 
[02:43:30]  Wait a minute.  How can it be number two?  Wait a minute.  What's channel CSI on?  Two.  Two.  CBS.  That's CBS.  That's CBS.  CBS rocks.  So what's NBC's biggie?  Kickin' ass.  Kickin' ass with that CSI.  I love Earl, the office.  Earl is NBC.  Yeah, that's a good show.  But what's their biggie?  What's their thing?  Earl.  NBC?  Yeah.  The office.  Earl.  Earl.  No big...  How about The Unit?  Earl.  The new hit show, The Unit. 
[02:44:00]  The Unit?  The fuck are you even talking about?  With the president?  They say it's the number one show.  With the president from, um...  24.  24.  He does the insurance commercials.  Dennis Haysburg.  Oh, right.  The guy who plays the black president.  The Unit.  Nothing from The Unit?  I swear to God, I don't know.  Never heard of The Unit?  No.  Without a trace?  Stuff I don't watch.  I just...  It's so many commercials.  You just know it exists.  I'm surprised I haven't...  Oh, yeah.  NBC, thanks.  It has deal.  Or no deal. 
[02:44:30]  Uh-huh.  What do they have?  I don't watch that.  They're fucking last place?  Fourth place.  To NBC?  Fucking to Fox?  They were...  Remember the Seinfeld Friends days?  NBC?  Couldn't be...  Cosby, motherfucker.  Cosby.  And let me tell you something.  I went down to NBC, and you know what they got pictures of?  Mm-hmm.  Every major person on NBC, except for guess fucking who?  Bill.  No Cosby.  William H. Cosby.  He probably demanded that they take it down.  No the fucking...  What?  He...  That station was how it is now? 
[02:45:00]  That guy's an ass.  The Cosby Show...  You know what?  Y'all are just teasing.  The Cosby Show was so much bigger than Seinfeld and his importance when it came out.  I love Seinfeld.  Yeah, in importance, I would say.  But motherfucker, that show brought them back to life.  In importance, I would say, yes.  Fuck!  And what?  Cheers did what?  Nothing.  They all rode Cosby's fucking ball trail.  All of them.  Cheers? 
[02:45:30]  Cheers was a baby of Cosby.  They were all Cosby babies.  You think?  Cheers did nothing.  Family ties?  Cheers.  Fucking Frazier.  Cosby babies.  Seinfeld's the only motherfucker that's been a Cosby baby.  I think Cheers was on first.  Cheers came on first.  Cheers was not on before Cosby.  It didn't become a hit until Cosby became one and then pumped the station up.  Because Cheers came on at 9 o'clock on Thursdays.  I remember that.  Wow.  Motherfucker.  If Cosby didn't bring that station back to life, Cheers was fledgling. 
[02:46:00]  A fledgling show before Cosby.  Just give it respect.  That's all I want.  That's all.  That's all.  And it's going to check on that.  Cheers.  1982.  Cosby 84.  Who heard of the fucking 82 and 83 years of Cheers?  Cosby 84.  Two years of Cheers before.  Of mediocrity.  Obscurity. 
[02:46:30]  Yes.  I always liked it.  Just admit it.  I loved the Cosby show.  I thought it was one of the best fantasies I've ever seen on television.  No doubt.  You're a fucking dick.  I really need to.  I really want to pour water on your console.  I didn't care.  It was one of the best fairy tales I've ever seen.  It was.  Once upon a time, there was a black doctor.  Wait a minute.  Once upon a time, it was a daddy in the home.  A daddy in the home.  Not only was he a daddy in the home, he was a doctor. 
[02:47:00]  And he had kids and all of them were nice and peaceful and successful in their own right.  And all the family all stayed together.  And the mom, what'd she do?  I gotta tell you.  She was a lawyer?  She was a lawyer.  She was a lot of black families.  A doctor and a lawyer.  There's a lot of black families in Park Slope.  Like that?  Listen.  A lot.  First time I saw the Cosby show, I went, God damn, they brought back Fantasy Island. 
[02:47:30]  Boss, boss, they crack.  Listen, man.  I love the Cosby, like, whenever one of the kids or something would go to the party,  and it would be an equal mix of black and white kids.  Where the fuck do you see that?  In Park Slope.  No, you don't.  In Middlebrook County in New Jersey.  Listen.  In Brooklyn, there's a lot of that going on.  And the thing about the Cosby show, man, that you gotta love is the party. 
[02:48:00]  First of all, you didn't think what you're saying now when you used to watch the Cosby show.  What?  Like, no one thought, oh, what is this bullshit?  The Cosby show was so great when it came out that it took away that ratio.  I was more a good times guy.  Yeah.  I kind of liked how.  I kind of liked how.  It's more of a better reality than when James did it.  When James, no.  Damn.  You do something.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  My favorite.  You knew there was some crack involved in that sitcom.  My favorite of all. 
[02:48:30]  Every.  This happened so many times on Good Times.  Like, the episode would start.  It was going to be a great time and a great day and something great was happening for the  Evans family.  James was going out to get a new job.  And he'd be like, Florida, when I come home, you better have a party waiting for me because  we're, but James, we only have the rent money.  James.  Baby, with the money I'm going to be pulling in, we can afford more than that.  So, of course, they'd spend the rent money on a party.  And then James would go down and a bad white man at the desk would sit there and go, you 
[02:49:00]  know, just so condescending.  That opening was last week.  We don't have other.  You're just doing that because I'm a black man.  And it's like, oh, well, that would be illegal, Mr. Evans, please.  And then James would go home and they'd be surprised, big party.  And he'd have to go, Florida, baby, they didn't give me no job.  And then Florida would be disappointed, but she'd go, that's okay.  You know, we're going to make it anyway, baby.  And the audience goes wild.  It was never a victimized moment on that show. 
[02:49:30]  That's the one.  It was never a victimized moment.  And must I say, the guy, what is his name?  Norman Lear, maybe?  Norman Lear, yeah.  That fucking cocksucker made great television, man.  I mean, Jefferson's, Good Times, Ahmaud, all my children.  And that's the thing.  You got to give credit for the daddies of all these shows.  All my children, all my children, all in the family, all in the family was the daddy  of all of those fucking things. 
[02:50:00]  Cosby was the daddy up until Seinfeld.  Seinfeld was the daddy of a lot of shit.  Cosby was a daddy, all in the family.  But Cheers, man, Cheers became popular after Cosby, man.  They surrounded the entire Thursday evening night.  For years.  Yeah, all right.  For some reason, they stuck behind it.  Let's go to Leslie in Cleveland.  James!  Leslie!  James!  Yes!  Where is JJ?  Hey, I just wanted to say, Patrice, Cosby, they could say Earth, and not Earth. 
[02:50:30]  Oh, E-A-R-F?  Yeah.  You know what I hate when you hear that this bitch is marginally intelligent, and she still  makes dumb black jokes.  That's what just gets me.  That's what got me about that heist clip.  This guy's like, oh, the black quarterback.  Like, how the fuck are you?  You're not even, you're a midget mentally, or a little person mentally.  And they, white people feel, dumb white people feel so comfortable saying that black  people are dumb.  It bugs me. 
[02:51:00]  Earth.  Earth.  Tim in Chicago, Tim.  I say Earth because there's something wrong with my teeth.  My tooth.  My tooth.  I got a bad tooth.  But that don't mean the mind.  You got a bad tooth?  I got a bad tooth.  He got a bad tooth.  But that doesn't mean my mind ain't saying tooth-es.  Tooth?  You got a bad tooth.  I know it's Teefas.  I know it's Teefas.  Hey, let's say hi to Tim in Chicago.  Hey, what's up, guys?  A lot of calls from Chicago lately.  How you doing there, Tim?  Patrice, I got to call you out, man.  You know, I never liked that motherfucker Bill Cosby. 
[02:51:30]  No?  That fake-ass nigga.  He got on my goddamn nerves.  You got to get to 40.  Goddamn, I couldn't stand that.  But how old are you, dude?  I'm about 19.  See, listen.  I didn't like the motherfucker.  I don't like him now.  Listen, though.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  When the Cosby Show came out, you were not born, maybe?  How old?  19.  You was born in, what, 80?  85?  Show how to go off, what, in the early 90s?  He didn't watch the Cosby Show. 
[02:52:00]  See, that's the same thing.  I still watch.  I mean, it still come over.  It's not as good.  It's not as good as it was.  When I was coming up, the Cosby Show was genius.  When I watch it now, it's not as good to watch.  But at the same time, that's like your age.  And I keep saying this.  Michael Jackson, to a guy this age, is not special.  He's always been a pedophile.  You know what I mean?  It's nothing.  There's no pain involved.  It's like, who gives a fuck about Michael Jackson?  But to somebody my age, that nigga was amazing.  Do you understand what I'm saying? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  To my age, Cosby was the shit when I grew up.  Now he's not.  Looking back, it's not that great.  He's got a great theory on Michael Jackson.  I saw you perform that at Avery Fisher Hall.  The Michael Jackson bit is amazing.  Yeah, man.  Because there were two Michael Jacksons.  There was a time where you're like, especially if you're into Michael Jackson.  If you're 36 years old, Michael Jackson, you have to qualify liking him.  You can't just go, fuck Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  He's a pedophile.  You have to go, I'm going to be into just the pre-pedophile music. 
[02:53:00]  Like A, B, C.  And then you have to start rationalizing.  Wait a minute.  Was that song You Were Not Alone?  Was he touching kids then?  When did he start doing that?  I love that fucking song.  Because he's so great, it's hard to go, oh my God, fuck this guy.  Yeah.  But when you're 19, everybody who means something to somebody 36 or older, he doesn't give a fuck about Cosby because Cosby is a pompous old fool to him. 
[02:53:30]  And that's what he's been in his life.  Like, black people, I don't do this, but this is what to do.  And he became this preachy asshole.  He's not Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable.  He was great.  I'm Heathcliff Huxtable.  They call me Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable.  This is my wife, Claire.  My children.  This year is T.O., Vanessa, and little Rudy. 
[02:54:00]  T.O.  T.O.  Let's go to Billy in Chicago.  Billy.  It's Chicago Day on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up, Billy?  Anthony, you remember a couple months ago you were talking about good times?  I think you caught a marathon or something on the weekend.  Yeah.  And I believe you said that they're just a bunch of niggers on there.  And I remember Opie wanted nothing to do with it.  You remember that?  You know something?  Yeah, I remember that day.  Did you say James Evans was a bunch of niggers?  Yeah, why don't you say that to Patrice?  I remember that day.  E.R., Anthony?  That's disturbing. 
[02:54:30]  And I can't believe that.  If I did, I got to apologize.  And did you say E.R.?  Yeah, yeah.  It was the whole.  Did you say a bunch of niggers?  You know something?  And I never fucking said that.  Are you insane?  I need to believe that my friend Anthony said E.R.  You find me the taste.  I, first of all, love that joke.  Walona?  Janet Jackson?  Walona.  Lady Di.  Walona.  And Walona was constantly hooking up.  Lady Di.  With some guy who turned out to be a scumbag. 
[02:55:00]  Lady Di on the phone?  What?  Is that Lady Di?  Lady Di on the phone?  Lady Di.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Lady Di.  Can you hold through the break?  Sure, I can.  How much you got left in the phone card?  How many minutes?  No, no.  No, I'm going to pay both.  All right, you better get more quarters.  Still got those out there?  I'm sure you got plenty of change.  Is there a giant cup worth?  I'm going to pay both right now.  I'm sure you have plenty of change, so can you hold through the break?  No, no, where's Jim?  Where's Jim Norton?  Listen, listen.  You got to listen.  You got to be reasonable and sensible for a second and listen. 
[02:55:30]  Okay.  We have to take a commercial break.  Okay.  We need you to hold on the phone.  Do you have enough quarters?  Yes, I do.  Let me try to explain it to you.  I don't know.  Shut up, Lady Di.  I'm going to try to explain it to you because you're homeless and you're collecting quarters.  You're panhandling.  See, Anthony and I are multi-millionaires, and the way they pay us is when we go to break  and they sell some commercials.  Okay.  So you can handle that, right?  Yeah.  So if we don't go to commercial, we don't make our millions.  Jesus.  Listen.  That affords us a wonderful life. 
[02:56:00]  I'll be on the phone.  So hopefully you have enough quarters left in that dirty cup of yours.  Wasn't you trying to buy a Pathmark in Elizabeth?  Yes.  No, wasn't she?  She'll just say yes to everything.  Wasn't you trying to purchase a Pathmark?  Wasn't you looking in to buy all the Pathmarks in Elizabeth?  No.  Yeah.  No, no, but I don't do anything by a Pathmark.  Kind of deal?  Will you shut up, Lady Di?  Lady Di.  We've got to pay some bills.  Just hold on during the commercials.  We'll be with you in about four minutes or so.  Joe in Jersey.  Joe? 
[02:56:30]  Yo, remember when Opie wanted to bang Florida Evans?  Right.  Opie said it live once that he actually wanted to bang Florida Evans.  Are you serious?  With that big ring around her neck.  Now, before I judge you, why?  Because I have a thing for middle-aged white women.  I really do.  For hot middle-aged white women, it's like a fetish thing.  You can't be this stupid.  I believe you want to fuck Florida.  How many times have you done this radio show?  I believe you might want to fuck Florida, man.  Don't be like that.  You can't be this stupid. 
[02:57:00]  Dude.  You might be on the show.  You've done this show enough to know that I fucked things up a lot.  You wanted to pop Florida?  No.  What happened?  I meant to say Thelma.  I believe that.  I would like to stretch this out, but I believe that.  Do you remember when Thelma was in Playboy?  Are you fucking kidding me?  There is a Playboy somewhere out there.  No, with Thelma?  With Thelma in it.  Yeah.  I would jerk my helmet to oblivion if I'd seen a fucking naked Thelma.  I used to go to the stationery store up the hill from my house, and I would steal the 
[02:57:30]  Playboys, which was just like the stress that I would feel before I would run out of there  with the Playboy, because I would make believe I'm getting baseball cards.  And then I'd walk around the store, wait for the guy to maybe go do something else.  And then I would make a mad dash for the Playboy, grab it, and run.  And I had the Playboy with Thelma in the woods for a long time.  You know, if you went into Harlem with a Thelma from Good Times Playboy, you may be able  to get $10,000 for it. 
[02:58:00]  I'll get it.  Yeah.  It's out there somewhere.  Go get it.  I am telling you.  You get it.  Fucking Kevin, I'm telling you something.  Can you bring that in?  I remember that one.  I'll get it.  If you get a Thelma from Good Times Playboy, I'm telling him.  So, we'll play the bit going into break.  Quickly, a little fun fact that I always find amusing is the fact that John Amos, who was  the father on that show on Good Times, was only eight years older than J.J.  J.J. was third.  I talked to J.J., who's Jimmy Walker's a very angry guy, by the way. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, absolutely.  He believes.  We know.  We fucked with him many times.  David Brenner told him to be clean.  Really?  And he goes, I used to be dirty.  And then David Brenner goes, man, you make a lot of money being clean.  And he went clean, and then Pride became Pride, and that motherfucker.  He thought he could be Pride.  And J.J. is built like fucking Martini Steve now.  Get out of here.  He can knock you through a fucking wall.  J.J. is a big guy.  J.J. does not fucking run.  He said he was 35 as J.J. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, he was eight years younger than the father character.  And Florida was 20 years older than James.  20 fucking years older than James.  She was 60?  The woman was born in 1920.  She was born in 1920.  Are you fucking serious?  Amazing.  Amazing.  Yeah, she was an old, old woman.  So we're going to go old school with this bit.  I don't even know if it holds up to the test of time.  Well, this was fun.  We had Lynch in the studio with us, and it was a party going on that day. 
[02:59:30]  And we were talking about good times, and I fucked up by saying Florida instead of Thelma.  And then just listen to Anthony.  I've got to go with it, man.  Listen to this.  You know, I stole the Playboy with Florida in it.  No, wait.  Thelma, Thelma, Thelma.  James.  James.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  James, Ope is looking at me, James.  Look, I got that big pack of hot dogs stabled to the back of my neck.  James, where's J.J.? 
[03:00:00]  Thelma.  You said Florida.  Everyone heard it.  Ope had the hots for Florida when he was a kid.  Come on, everyone heard it.  Ope, come here, give me some love.  Little brown sugar, Ope.  James.  That was only until Wheezy came along.  All right, all right.  The beauty that was Wheezy.  All right.  Oh, if only I could be George Jefferson.  I'll move you on up. 
[03:00:30]  Now you've gone too far, man.  You said it, man.  Yeah, how about that Anesta, Ope?  Shut up.  Come here, heathen.  Oh, man.  Well, let's change the subject and talk about Stephen Lynch.  I could never squeeze out syrup out of that Aunt Jemima bottle without thinking, wow, what  a hot babe.  Yeah.  I'd lose my syrup.  Oh, man.  Well, you heard it here, folks. 
[03:01:00]  Ope, hots for Florida from good times.  Stole the Playboy.  That Playboy I never saw, but I guess it's in Ope's personal collection.  The one with Florida.  James, I'm naked and Playboy.  All right.  Son of a...  Look at the picture we got on the wall.  Check this out.  James!  Oh, man.  There she is. 
[03:01:30]  Esther Rowe.  Wow.  She is truly dynamite.  Yeah, look at that.  Yeah.  Chocolate thunder.  Just sucks when you put your foot in your mouth on this show, you know?  What was Hugh Hefner thinking that month, huh?  I don't know.  He was on the crank.  All right.  It was after the stroke.  Get me, Eskimo!  I am trying to change the subject here so fast. 
[03:02:00]  Because this could go on for another three weeks.  James!  Here's the picture, Opie.  Are you feeling that tingle?  Yeah.  Here it is, Opie.  Time to feel free.  In a time you're up and under.  Not getting hassled.  Not getting hustled.  Keeping your head up the water.  Opie loves mama.  Dino man! 
[03:02:30]  Simple rapidly on.  Good times.  Easy credit rip-off.  Rip-off.  Good times.  Second life.  Surviving.  Good times.  Hanging and a jawing.  Good times.  Ain't we lucky we got him.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Good times.  Yeah.  Opie's got good times in his pants.  Woo, James!  James!  Now, J.J., I have company this evening. 
[03:03:00]  Opie's coming over.  After James got killed, remember that?  She would have liked a guy like you.  Shut up.  You'd have fit good in the projects.  All right.  You'd have to suffer the scrutiny of Michael, the younger brother.  Yes.  Yes.  Remember how angry he was.  That's right.  I don't think Opie would have cut the monster with his hair and everything.  Mama! 
[03:03:30]  Why are you dating that white boy?  He's very nice.  Now, come on.  Let Mama go out with Opie.  James!  Mama, he's the devil.  Well, he's showing the devil in bed.  Wait till I tell Walona what he did to me.  Of course he can't stack up to James, Larry Counts. 
[03:04:00]  You know, this picking on someone is not that fun after all.  I always thought it was fun to pick on people.  Oh, it's a blast.  Come on this side.  Hey, what's that?  Well, you've never seen it before?  It looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock. 
[03:04:30]  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can buck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  Is...  Is...  It's the fucking rock, you dildo. 
[03:05:00]  Let's say hi to Danny.  Danny, what's going on today, man?  Hey, uh...  Just wanted to tell you that I got that Playboy.  For, uh, the tree.  The good time I'm selling my one?  What's it look like, man?  Like, what's she looking like in there?  Oh, she's hot, bud.  What are they showing?  They show...  She's got, like, bush, right?  Like, black girl hair on her pussy?  Oh.  Afro. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, just a thick, bushy pussy.  I wonder if someone has it on Pal Talk.  Oh, my God.  They can hold it up to their camera.  Okay, it won't.  I know we're asking a lot, but...  It won't be live.  All right, Danny, bring it, uh...  Bring it in, or mail it in.  That would be great.  Or copies of the pictures.  Whatever you want to do.  I got a picture.  Not naked, but it looks pretty recent.  And, uh...  She kind of still looks like herself.  All right, Danny.  All right, thanks a lot.  Aw, thanks, dude.  Wow, man.  How fucking gorgeous is she must be? 
[03:06:00]  Lady Di.  Hello.  Oh, that's right.  I'm staying in hold over here.  Lady Di!  How you doing?  She's in the Projects.  Bad times!  Bad times.  Oh, Christ.  How does hobo cum taste?  What?  I don't know.  We heard about you, Di.  What did you hear about me?  You're homeless, right? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  Yes, I am.  Now...  There's no joke about that.  Right, no joke.  Of course, Paris, the thought we joke.  That's terrific.  Lady Di.  Yes, hi.  In your own stupid words, what happened?  How did you end up homeless?  Now, let's hear...  I ended up being behind on the rent, and I got evicted.  Let's hear the Lady Di version, because we already heard the real version.  Right.  Now, how did you get behind on the rent if you had a job at Dunkin' Donuts?  Because, no, that's very easy to do.  My rent was over $1,000 a month. 
[03:07:00]  It was about $1,000 a month.  Why, since you were only you, why didn't you move to someplace cheaper?  I should have done that years ago.  You're right about that.  Shoulda, shoulda, shoulda.  But I didn't do that.  I just, you know, figured I'd stick it out over there, but it didn't happen that way.  So you stay at a $1,000 a month house.  I thought I was going to find another roommate.  That would have been good.  But that didn't happen either.  So you got thrown out.  Where is your furniture and stuff? 
[03:07:30]  I sold most of my furniture.  So she sold everything she had.  So right now, you have the wrinkled, dirty shirt on your back.  Yeah.  And no money.  No money whatsoever.  And where do you, like...  I mean, I bought a couple of dollars, but that's it.  Where do you sleep?  Right now, where do I sleep?  I know.  Where did you sleep?  What was that guy asking?  Yeah, what was that guy?  No, it was a lady.  And what did she want?  Nothing.  She said hi to me. 
[03:08:00]  No, you said, I know.  Oh, no.  No, this is where I sleep at right now.  Okay?  Wherever I can.  I go to friends' houses sometimes.  And sometimes on top of the train tracks.  On top of the train tracks?  Right on the train tracks, right there.  They can train tracks.  Like outside your...  You sleep...  What do you cover yourself with?  We got blankets up there.  Oh, like everyone knows. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, it's wonderful.  Who has blankets up there?  The other homeless people.  The other homeless...  And they give up their blankets to you?  Yeah.  Again, how does hobo come taste?  By the way, if Mary hears this, I'm doing okay.  I'm doing okay.  No, you're not.  She, first of all, doesn't care.  She gave up on you.  She gave up on you.  Doesn't care.  Even your best friend gave up on you.  How does that feel?  What do you want me to do?  I mean, you know...  Well, maybe start listening to people would be a good start.  I don't betray...  Hi.  So, Di.  Okay. 
[03:09:00]  Lady Di, I hear you were mugged?  No, not yet.  No, I heard you were mugged.  They stole your money and your cell phone.  Yeah, they did.  All right.  So, what do you say?  Why did you say...  Wait, wait, wait.  Why did you say not yet when I said you were mugged?  Because I didn't think anybody would tell you that.  It's the whole thing.  She's a lying sack of shit.  And it's true that you're fucking for grapefruit rinds.  Hold on.  One second.  What?  Are you still there? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Why?  Somebody wants to talk to you.  Hold on.  Hold on one second.  All right.  Hey, how you doing, buddy?  Good.  Who is this?  This is a friend of the Lady Di's.  What's your name, sir?  My name is Frank.  Your name's Frank.  And what type of friend are you?  Well, I just got done working with the store ledger papers.  I bought her a beer.  I bought myself a shot in a beer for the weekend, holiday weekend.  Shot a Blackberry brandy.  All right.  So, you bought her a little bit of beer.  And what's she doing for you in exchange? 
[03:10:00]  I didn't do nothing.  I just met her recently.  How long ago was recently?  I feel sorry for her.  So, I try to help her.  I don't feel sorry for her.  I know she's having a little problem.  But, yeah.  Yeah.  I guess you could call her feel sorry.  How long have you known her?  About a week or two.  About a week or two.  Now, sir, you have to be completely honest here because we have known her for a long time.  Are you having any type of sexual contact with her?  No, sir.  Not even kissing?  No, sir.  Cop a feel? 
[03:10:30]  No, sir.  Are you homeless, too?  No, sir.  You're not homeless?  No, sir.  Where do you live?  In Elizabeth.  I lived in Elizabeth for 40 years.  So, why don't you let her live with you?  Because in my rooming house where I stay, I'm not allowed to have anybody stay except for myself.  So, it's a rooming house.  I already told her they have rooms available so you can get some money.  How much?  $125 a week for what I pay.  $125 a week? 
[03:11:00]  Damn, motherfucker, that's five under the goddamn line.  A lot of money for a rooming house.  Will you share a bathroom?  Well, that's what they all are in Elizabeth now.  In Elizabeth?  Yeah, there's four bathrooms in the house.  Yeah, there's four bathrooms there except for the guy and the girl upstairs and they have their own bathroom.  And you just hear yelling and fucking arguing and shit.  So, where's Lady Di sleeping these days?  She's over by a couple of people that I know for years over by the railroad tracks.  She's a good girl.  I understand she's got problems.  With the homeless people by the tracks.  Do you think you're helping her by giving her a shot and a beer? 
[03:11:30]  Well, I don't see why not.  If she enjoys it.  Yeah, but don't you understand that's pretty much what's gotten her to this point is her drinking?  I don't know that long to say that.  Well, rest assured, that's it.  Do you know that she has a son that she pretty much abandoned and lives with her father?  Yeah, yeah, but she's a nice girl.  She knows people I know also that sleep over on the tracks.  As a matter of fact, one of the guys over there, I met him.  I was the manager of his baseball team.  Now, he's sleeping on the tracks for two years now. 
[03:12:00]  Is it good?  Yeah, he was very good.  No, no, no.  He was the clean-up batter for my team.  Is it good?  Yeah, he's all right.  No, no, Lady Di.  The cho-chop.  She's nice.  I talk to her.  No, I'm saying when you...  You already said he's not banging her.  Oh, he's not banging?  You're not banging it?  No, no.  Is anybody banging Lady Di on the tracks?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know about all that, but yeah, obviously, yeah.  So she has sex on the tracks with the people up there?  Yeah, yeah.  Isn't that poetic? 
[03:12:30]  A train on a train track.  And that's to get money?  Yeah, she's right.  She tries to get money so she can, you know...  So she gives blowjobs or...  I don't know about all that now.  Like I said, I'm only new with her, and I ain't trying to go that way.  But how do you know that?  Has she told you that she has had sex for money on the tracks?  No, he used to be on my baseball team.  He was the clean-up batter.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  So this guy's all over the place.  And he's almost a schizophrenic.  I taught him how to play baseball. 
[03:13:00]  Wait, let me ask you.  No, give a shit about the baseball.  Enough about the baseball player.  Does he fuck some of the guys in trade?  They give her, like, their panhandle route?  Like, the clientele?  Like I said, whether he hits home runs, he...  Hey, hey, hey, hey, you motherfucker.  You're pissing me off.  Enough about the baseball.  Hey, I'm sorry.  Hey, dude, do not mention the baseball.  I swear.  I got my shot in the beer here, the Blackberry Brandy.  I didn't even drink the... 
[03:13:30]  I just got off work.  I sold 60 small legend papers.  I'm tired.  So I'm sorry about that.  The guy is babbling.  Put Lady Di back on the phone.  I've had it with you and your baseball player.  I wish we could say the same.  So what was he, the clean-up?  Yeah, I heard about your shows over the years.  Yeah.  Those are a good show.  Yeah, what was he, the clean-up hitter?  Yes, he was.  Shut the fuck up.  Most of the time.  Put Lady Di back on.  And one other, one other guy.  Oh, my God.  Somebody's probably fucking her right now.  He's trying to cover.  Yeah.  All right, here you go. 
[03:14:00]  Here's the Lady Di.  Put her back on.  All right, put her back on.  She's zipping up the back zipper of her sack.  Hi, Gold.  Someone start up the Lady Di death pool.  Lady Di.  Yes.  All right, I'm going to ask you a question.  What?  I know the answer already, so don't fucking lie.  I'm not going to fucking lie.  Go ahead.  All right, are you on the tracks at night having sex in exchange for money or food?  No.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  Have you had any intimate contact with anybody on the tracks? 
[03:14:30]  I don't kiss and tell.  That's not like you're having a romantic fucking date.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We're talking about hobo car.  Dude, you are trading sexual favors.  No, I don't do that.  You are trading sexual favors for money.  No, I'm not doing that.  Yes, you are.  Why can't you admit it?  You know something?  Until you admit things, you are going to continue sleeping on the fucking train track.  No, I'm not going to do that either. 
[03:15:00]  This is only like one thing right now.  So what you have done with the kissing and not telling is for romance, loneliness, friendship.  What do you do it for?  Probably loneliness, but no, I don't do that.  She drinks and doesn't tell.  Oh, yeah, you want some of this moonshine on your face?  Yeah, maybe.  So, Lady Di, you're telling me if you want to drown your sorrows with some booze one night  and you can't afford it because you don't have any money and some guy says, you know,  you suck my dick, I'll give you a fucking bottle of beer. 
[03:15:30]  No, no, I wouldn't do that.  That hasn't happened.  Then where are you getting your booze from?  That has not happened.  Where are you getting your booze from?  The guy just told you.  Friends.  That's it.  They just give it to you.  Yeah.  They're homeless.  They're homeless and living in shelters and they give you their booze for nothing.  He's not a homeless guy.  Yeah, he lives in a fucking shelter and he's a schizophrenic.  Believe me, he's one step away from being homeless.  That's pretty much homeless.  Everybody's two paychecks away from being homeless.  I don't care. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  You know, how you are, whatever.  That's two paychecks away from being homeless.  Yeah, keep believing that crap.  It can't happen.  When was the last time you showered, Lady Di?  Yesterday, why?  Where?  Where?  My dad's house.  Your dad won't see you.  We heard this already.  Your dad will not see you.  How do you know about this?  We know.  We heard everything.  You're a compulsive fucking liar.  Okay.  Your dad won't see you.  Where did you shower?  I showered at my dad's house.  Liar, liar.  Pants full of hobo cum. 
[03:16:30]  Where did you shower?  You've always lied to us.  See, this is, now the new listeners are finally going to understand.  So she's saying that your father, you're saying your father lets you shower and then says get the fuck out.  Right.  Right after he lets you do an intimate thing in his house, he tells you to leave after you fucking go shower, you fucking bitch, and get out.  And then get out.  And what did you steal from him?  Yeah, well, he, no, I don't.  I don't do that.  I don't steal.  How far from the tracks is your father's house? 
[03:17:00]  I don't know, about maybe three, four miles.  Mm-hmm.  And he lets you shower, and then you say, bye, daddy, I'm going back to sleep with the homeless.  I'm not going to tell him where I'm sleeping at.  He doesn't ask.  But he asks you, he asks you why, I'm sleeping at a place that doesn't have a shower?  Right.  If you're going over there to shower, apparently you're fucking homeless.  You know, if you guys could do me a favor on whackfake.com.  No, you're lying to us.  No, no, no, no.  Not until you tell the truth.  No, no, no.  All right, you want me to tell you the truth? 
[03:17:30]  Yes.  This is the truth.  We help out people that, you know, really deserve it.  That means she was lying.  If she's going to say you want the truth, would have you been lying the whole time?  What's the truth, Lady Di?  The truth is I am homeless, and I'm doing whatever I can, okay, to get by right now.  And that includes...  Lady Di, that includes what?  Hold on one minute.  Hold on.  Let's listen.  Hello?  Hello?  She hung up on us. 
[03:18:00]  She hung up.  Hold on, hold on.  Now, for the new listeners, we've been dealing with that on a steadily declining basis.  To the point she's at now, completely destitute, for years now.  When we first met her, she actually had a pretty good job.  She had a good job with Budweiser.  Budweiser, I believe, yeah.  She worked in, like, one of the Budweiser plants or something like that.  Her son.  Did they fucking tell you something?  I think she was...  Yeah, I know.  She went where the booze was.  And now, that's what you get.  But the one consistency through the entire episode is the fact that she is a compulsive liar. 
[03:18:30]  She will never tell the truth.  She will never be honest with herself, which is the most important thing.  And she's just going to stay where she is.  Lady Di Deathpool.  Let's get it running, because she don't have much time left.  No.  One minute, one minute.  Click.  I'm going to hang up on a lot of people so we can clear lines.  Maybe she'll call back.  Frank in New York City, really fast.  Hey, just real quick, guys.  This morning, when I first heard the story, I really felt bad for her. 
[03:19:00]  But now, when I hear what a lying, denial-ass she is, I don't feel sorry at all for her.  She deserves where she is.  And until she gets her shit together, that's where she's going to stay.  We've told her so many times.  That's why.  It's not like one of these things where she's just calling and needs help.  Even Patty we helped out.  You know what?  Patty is an ass.  But at least she kind of wants to be helped and realizes that if we came up with money for her,  it was going to rent so she could get back on her feet while she got a new job, which she went out and did. 
[03:19:30]  You know, Pat from Munaki, she's just an ass who lives in a fucking old tuna can with holes in it.  I question Stalker Patty, though.  Do you?  Absolutely.  She came in here, got naked, and, you know, was crawling around amongst mousetraps to find checks for her to pay the rent.  And this morning, you look over at Pal Talk.  She's on Pal Talk.  Yeah, true.  Why isn't she working?  Yeah, the GOAP's right.  Patty's the next homeless person.  Patty, why aren't you working?  Well, she's got a job at Starbucks, I believe. 
[03:20:00]  When does she work?  She's on Pal Talk all the time.  Anyway.  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  So bad for that?  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, she's going to suffer the same fate.  Isn't it so ironic that her husband killed himself by stepping onto the train tracks,  and now every night when she's sleeping, there's a constant... 
[03:20:30]  Constant reminder of an 1843 train rolling by her.  I was going to call you out, finally.  You've got some great sound effects, but I'm like, what the fuck, man?  That's really funny.  Hey, let's do a...  That was the X-Sella?  Yeah.  Let's do a speed round here, man.  London.  A woman's skeleton was discovered in her apartment, surrounded by Christmas presents, and with the TV on.  Creepy.  Three years after she is believed to have died. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, she died, just sat there, and apparently rotted away.  Just a dead, pretty much a skeleton, sitting there amongst Christmas presents, and the TV on.  It just goes to show you, you don't know who you're broadcasting to.  Like a scene from Conan.  Yeah, just like...  Like, when he finds, like, Osiris, and he gets his sword, and the motherfucker's just chilling there with two dead dogs still in the same position.  Motherfucker pulls the sword out of her.  You pull the remote out of her, and her hand comes off.  You hold the remote up, and fucking the Conan music comes on. 
[03:21:30]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Well, Joyce Vincent, 40, probably died of natural causes in early 2003, police said, at an inquest this week, based on mail and prescriptions found in the apartment.  But her remains were only found in January this year, when housing officials finally decided to hunt her down to pay the bank rent.  It took three fucking years.  She must have lived in one of those...  Two paychecks.  Dude, I'm...  Those Stonehenge places like... 
[03:22:00]  If I'm late with the rent, two days, my freaking landlord's calling me.  Two fucking days.  They waited three years and said, well, we better see what the hell's going on here.  You're late with your rent?  And the fucking mail, because they put it in the slots over there, in the door, like old school.  Hey, Opie brought up, you're late with your rent?  Yeah, just, you know, I can't do regular things.  A lot of bills, right?  But you won't hire anybody to do it, but you still try to handle your own thing, right?  I can't do regular things right.  You just forget.  I forget parking tickets, and you just forget things until you go, holy shit.  Why are you shocked by that?  I'm shocked that you're late with the rent. 
[03:22:30]  I just, yeah, sometimes.  That's like shit that freaks me out.  I have to have everything early or completely on time.  Oh, please.  That was from the past, though.  Rent.  There was a time where you went early.  Oh, I was hiding from the landlord.  I used to hide.  I'd see his car pull up.  He had a firebird.  Dude, I screw up.  And we all hide.  Your landlord had a firebird?  You're just white trash down to your knuckle.  It was awful white trash.  Down to your white blood cells.  It's just fucking Jesus.  I had, like, five roommates. 
[03:23:00]  The table was full of beer.  We'd call the place Pee-wee's Playhouse.  And, like, instead of paying the rent, we'd go out and buy radio control toys and stuff.  Oh.  And barbecue out back.  We'd just buy a big London broils and cook with tools, like wrenches, because we didn't  have anything to cook with.  We'd be flipping it with pliers and shit.  And the landlord would pull up.  We'd just run inside, lock the door, and hide.  Playing, I want to rock.  He'd be, I know you're in there, motherfucker.  I want to rock. 
[03:23:30]  I'm going to eat dirt or whatever.  I want to rock.  I know you're in there.  Kumia.  He's the car.  You're Kumia.  Fuck out, Kumia.  Fucking asshole.  And I'd be, like, that fucking asshole wanting his fucking money.  Let me know I don't have any.  The story gets crazier.  Let's see.  When officials broke into her apartment, they discovered the woman's largely skeletal remains  on the floor surrounded by Christmas presents.  The television was on as it apparently had been for three years. 
[03:24:00]  Three years.  Three straight years.  The 40-year-old's body was so decomposed that the only way to identify her was to compare  dental records with a holiday photograph.  Holiday photo.  Was there an open lost ark next to her?  Who?  Wait.  I want to know who the presents were to or from.  Yeah.  Because where were those people?  She obviously gave out shitty presents every year.  Yeah.  No one noticed or cared.  I didn't get a present yet, but who cares?  It's going to be a dumb sweater.  I got to return anyway.  Just think of the newscaster sitting there broadcasting to a skeleton. 
[03:24:30]  Tonight's news on the BBC One.  Ready for this?  So the sisters attended the inquest, but there's no explanation for why they never checked on  her over the years.  They didn't like her.  And then it ends with this.  In another sad twist, it was disclosed that Vincent had moved into the apartment after  becoming a victim of domestic violence.  Ah, there you go.  Shit.  Pretty sad.  Have fun with that one.  Is that Lady Diya's future? 
[03:25:00]  At the truck stop?  At the train tracks, not in front of a TV.  That woman at least had an apartment.  Marion has given up on Lady Di.  That means it's not good.  And that Lady Di is a hopeless case.  But Marion's the one with that awful afro, right?  Her friend.  Marion is a friend to the end.  Football helmet hair without the face mask.  That's what she got.  I shouldn't say to the end, but she is the type of friend that, I mean, she's a saint.  Done a lot for her.  She tried everything.  If she gave up on her, it's got to be really bad. 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  Yes.  She's into booze.  Who knows what kind of drugs.  Sex for money.  I took a shot.  And she just hung up on her.  She did the old trick in a book.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, wait.  Because she didn't want to tell the truth.  Hey, this falling tree story is an unlucky lottery.  Unlucky lottery.  Want to explain that to the new listeners out there?  Unlucky lottery is when something happens, the odds of which are so astronomical that you should win lottery.  You should win the lotto. 
[03:26:00]  Those are the odds.  You ever hear that?  The odds of winning the lotto or mega ball, whatever the fuck it is.  It's like, you know, millions to one, hundreds of millions.  You always say you have a better chance of, you know, getting struck by lightning is the good example.  Right.  But instead of those odds going in your favor by being lucky and winning, the odds went against you and it was unlucky.  Same odds, millions to one that something like this will happen.  But I'll give you a prime example.  It happened on the parkway here in New York. 
[03:26:30]  A boulder that had apparently had sat and watched dinosaurs, you know, a boulder that was up there.  Saw dinosaurs, saw the dawn of man, saw us building from nothing up to, and then one day, it just decides to roll down the hill and hit a station wagon full of people.  That rock was sitting there, saw, you know, fucking Columbus could have stood on that rock. 
[03:27:00]  It's because God gets bored, too.  God gets bored and decides to flick that thing off of his mouth.  He just gets bored.  And he just, we're just chest pieces.  He just pushed that rock.  You know what?  Boink.  With his index finger.  See that station wagon coming?  Watch my timing.  Watch this.  Watch this.  Boink.  Da-de-da-de-de-de-de-de-de.  Done.  So, here's the story.  Falling tree kills deaf Italian tourists.  Oh, mamma mia.  Oh, my God. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, no.  You think everyone around him was just screaming, and he's just like, look out.  With his camera taking a picture or something.  Taking a picture.  Rome.  A century-old tree.  Century-old.  Here we go.  Hundred years.  Hundred years.  The thing sat there, saw a few popes.  A century-old tree fell on a group of deaf tourists in central Italy on Sunday, killing  a man, and injuring seven people who were unable to hear a bus driver's shout of alarm.  Hey, get out of the way. 
[03:28:00]  Me.  What's your name?  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  He probably was an asshole.  He ran a deaf Italian.  Motherfuckers always talk with their hands, the Italians.  No, we're signing you, idiots.  They should have the lady that used to yell Anthony out the window saying,  Anthony. 
[03:28:30]  I want that motherfuck on whack.  I don't want to need him no more.  They killed Sonny at the thorn booth.  That, that, that tree.  That tree now has made him neat with the wishes.  He nips.  He what?  With the nipses.  He what?  Loo the money. 
[03:29:00]  Leap with the men.  Loo for your body?  No.  Loo the.  You leap with a.  Loo the money.  Leap.  With the men.  Someone get someone in here.  I can fucking understand.  I'm going to shoot this motherfucker.  Hey, Henry.  Henry, you're going to help me out here.  Look.  The, the ninyin. 
[03:29:30]  I, man in the norma, he named me muse.  I, man in the norma, he named me muse.  If you never love my ninja again, I'll love the ninyin.  Don't do that dance on my ninja.  They, the ninyin', they were banging guck.  I, man, didn't do anything to any other.  The, the, the, the, the, the, the drink at the bar.  The, the ninyin.  The ninyin, me mate.  The, the, the ninyin. 
[03:30:00]  The, the ninyin.  The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the.  left. That would have went  off for 15 minutes easily. Of course it would have.  Man denies lewdness claiming  missing part. We're going to have to save this  story. He got charged with masturbating  in public. Yeah. His defense, he doesn't  have a penis. It's a pretty good defense.  That's a great story. We'll have to do that.  I mean, it sucks for him, but  all right, listen. Patrice O'Neal did a great job  for us the last couple of days. Love it. Patrice, 
[03:30:30]  thank you so much. Love it. Are we promoting anything?  We're going to do the Black Phillips show a week  from tomorrow, I guess, right?  Yeah. All right, very cool.
