<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with a montage highlighting the hosts as "shock jocks" and "radio bad boys."  Anthony recounts his weekend at a Renaissance festival, detailing his costume, axe-throwing escapades, encounters with fans (including a former caller working at a beer booth), and the extensive video footage he shot.  This is followed by a graphic description of his girlfriend's emergency gallbladder surgery, his own hangover, and the successful laparoscopic procedure, punctuated with humorous anecdotes from the hospital.  The show then touches upon Tiger Woods' golf success, the Yankees and Red Sox standings, and the Space Shuttle Endeavor (repeatedly mispronounced as "Spatial Endeavor"), along with several news clips showcasing news anchors' inappropriate reactions to a fashion show mishap and a fatal car accident.  Listener calls follow, with Bill attempting to secure an invitation to the show and Steve, a trucker, providing a firsthand account of the car crash.

The next segment begins with a discussion of a caller who witnessed a car crash but offered few details.  This transitions into speculation about the Space Shuttle Endeavor's re-entry and media hype. A brief replay of a Jonah Hill interview features a humorous anecdote about his landlord. The segment then features a series of callers: Jim clarifies a misunderstanding about an anti-French commercial; Tom suggests a Nicole Kidman movie plot involving aliens and a space shuttle crash; Frank proposes a car wrap advertisement deal with the hosts, sparking discussion on costs and legalities; and Scott prompts a conversation about Anthony's rapier, jokingly dubbed the "sword of the gay."  The hosts then discuss the death of Merv Griffin.  Jennifer, a caller, criticizes the Renaissance Fair discussion, leading to a heated exchange. The segment continues with a discussion of Merv Griffin's song "I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts," a "Cue of the Day" riddle about seatbelts, and a prolonged, often antagonistic search for a "good Jennifer" among numerous callers with that name.  Further discussion includes the death of Merv Griffin, a box office report, and the departure of the show's intern, Jared.

The final segment begins with a discussion about a blind kitten and a cruel game suggestion involving loud noises.  This is followed by a "feel good story"â€”the alleged abuse of a 15-year-old girl at a Christian boot camp, where she was reportedly tied to a rope and dragged behind a van.  The hosts and callers react with varying degrees of outrage and dark humor, discussing child discipline and the pastor's response.  The conversation then returns to humorous anecdotes about cats and potentially harmful games involving them.  A phone interview with Andrew Kaplan, author of "The Charisma Creator," follows.  The interview, interrupted by humorous interjections from the hosts and co-host, focuses on his book, using examples from a fictionalized train encounter with a woman.  The segment concludes with promotional announcements for the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus show and a giveaway.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.

[00:01:30]  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  See Jimmy, you miss so much.  All I was doing all weekend was saying that.  What?  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  Spatial Endeavor.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  We've got a very busy week with this radio show.

Yeah.  So we'll find out, hopefully within the first hour, and give out information on how to get

Yeah, we're sorting out the details for our trip to Washington because there's going to  be many opportunities to see us.  You can watch the show live on Friday.  Yeah.  You can go to the comedy show on Saturday.  Jimmy's doing a special thing for XM.  XM, it's all-encompassing this week.  Lots to do, lots to do.  How was everybody's weekend?  I know how Anthony's weekend was.  It started with a Renaissance festival.  The Renaissance festival.  Another one?  I was very festive.  No, it was the only one I've been to this year. 
[00:03:00]  It was Saturday.  That's exactly what I think, too.  Another one, but it's only once a year.  Nope.  Went with my girl and Dave.  Eastside Dave came with his lovely bride, Casey, and Danny, of course, and then a couple  of friends of mine, and oh, what a time.  What a time.  We wound up getting three full digital videotapes. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Can we get some of that audio on the air?  I just have to sort through.  I was supposed to sort through it yesterday, but had a little jam up yesterday.  What happened?  I'm exhausted.  See, I already know what happened.  I'm exhausted.  But I got to make believe.  I don't know.  We went to the Renaissance fair.  I had a great time.  Yeah.  Everything was hunky-dory.  I dressed up first time ever that I got dressed in Renaissance regalia.  What do you mean first time ever? 
[00:04:00]  It is.  Halloween parties.  Oh, Halloween parties are different.  Everyone dresses up on Halloween.  This was, you know, the Renaissance.  And then I was walking around going, hello, fair maiden.  Ugh.  Wait, where'd you go with Fez?  And you guys all went with something.  Isn't that a Renaissance fair you went recently?  Well, Fez didn't go.  But did you go to one recently?  No.  We were planning this one.  Medieval Times.  Oh, we went to Medieval Times.  Yes.  That's different.  Isn't that kind of like a Renaissance festival?  No, no.  You'd just sit in your seat and eat, you know, food without silverware.  Eat big turkey legs? 
[00:04:30]  Big turkey legs.  And we went there and had a great time.  Got smashed.  Videotaped it.  Doing dangerous things.  See, after you drink at a Renaissance fair, the best thing to do is grab sharp objects and  hurl them at targets you can't possibly hit and mock other people that have like weapons  that they aren't doing good until they get mad at you.  And then you threaten the guy behind the counter that you're going to start lobbing the weapons 
[00:05:00]  over the top of the little hut where the target's on it and send it out into the highway and  he gets very upset.  Are you talking about the axes?  Axes.  Arrows?  Yes.  We were throwing axes at targets and I was pretty good.  I got the hang of it pretty fast.  But there were a few guys that weren't very good at it and we got much laughter, much  jocularity laughing at them screwing up and we made it known that we were laughing at them. 
[00:05:30]  Ha ha ha, look at you.  You are incompetent.  You should be embarrassed to be throwing those axes in front of the king.  Who's the king?  I was pretty good.  I think I was, no, the king was walking around.  Like the king walks around.  One, you kidnap the king and then you could have become the king.  The king's guard walks with him.  Are you insane?  He's going to take out the guard.  He's just a kid from some college.  Insane.  Trying to make a few extra bucks over the summer. 
[00:06:00]  Exactly.  Just take out the king's guard.  Take out the king and take over the Renaissance Festival.  Is there a hierarchy among those nerds?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  I'm playing the king and the guy who's playing the guard really has to kind of be nice to  the guy who's really playing the king.  Like there's, yeah, there's guys that are like, you know, well, I have to go to the joust.  And he's like, oh, wow.  He rides the horse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there's lowly, you know, whatever they called the poor people back then.  You know, and they're, oh, good day, sir. 
[00:06:30]  Good day.  They got a bowdy people as they're walking down the little trails.  Paupers.  Paupers.  Surf's.  Surf's.  That's right.  Surf's.  The surf's.  God, I learned that in high school.  I can finally.  You never get to use that in daily life, do you?  Right, right, right.  And then there's a lot of fat broads that cinch up these corsets and turn their fat into  boobs.  They try anyway. 
[00:07:00]  And Danny had no qualms about, as he's videotaping one of these women, he points at her belly and  goes, her boobs and goes, hey, was that a bunt this morning?  And just pushing everything.  Oh, he got hammered, Danny, without his shirt on, wearing nothing but a chainmail halter.  Oh, he looked so queer.  And who else did we meet?  At a beer booth.  Many O&A fans, by the way.  Many O&A fans coming up, taking pictures with me, loving the show. 
[00:07:30]  And there was a girl behind the beer booth, one of the beer booths.  And she goes, I know you.  I was on your show once.  Uh-oh.  What'd she do with her vagina?  What did she do with her vagina on our show?  She certainly wasn't in there to discuss Russian history.  Well, oddly enough that you say that.  Yeah.  Because in a way, she kind of was with a Russian.  Okay. 
[00:08:00]  And another girl, she was, um, what was her name?  Miss, Misty.  Oh, boy.  Monday?  Misty Monday?  Well, let me get her name right.  Well, what'd she do on our show back in the day?  Misty Monday.  She was in Playmate of the Apes.  Remember?  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  That was her.  It wasn't her.  Oh, okay.  She was one of the other girls in Playmate of the Apes.  Yeah, but the other broad was the star.  Yeah, she was.  All right.  But this girl, you know, she was caught up in that industry for a while. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  And, um, we, we gave a little, we had a little interview with her that's on a videotape  and I got to pull some audio from that because Danny, again, starts talking about how well  she's doing now working a beer booth at a Renaissance fair.  Yeah, wow.  Is she a porn chick?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  I remember her back in the day.  She was doing, like, the soft porn.  Like, didn't really get any action.  Yeah.  So it was like, why would you buy these tapes?  Yeah.  Because you're not.  Playmate of the Apes.  It's either you want to see lots of flesh or really good acting.  Uh-huh. 
[00:09:00]  The in-between stuff, no one gives a crap about.  You're getting nothing here.  Oh, there's me with, um, my, uh, gear on.  That's beforehand and after.  But I, I also got a nice hat with feather plumage.  Yeah.  And a sword.  Yes.  You fluffed out your hair, I see.  Well, no, I just took my hat off.  Because I can't wear a baseball cap in the Renaissance period.  Wasn't there another hat you could wear?  There's got me somewhere.  Uh, yeah, but I, I went around without a hat as I searched out a hat.  And then I found a lovely one with nice feather plumage. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, looks wonderful.  I hope you threw it in the garbage on your way out.  No.  No, it is all still there.  Well, actually, um.  It's called buying the myth.  We talk about it on the show all the time.  You go to the, the Renaissance Festival.  You buy all this stuff.  You look cool while you're there.  You look like you're fitting in.  And then you have to walk back to your car in the parking lot looking like a, a doofus.  Dude, the parking lot was no problem because other people were dressed like that.  What was odd was checking into the hotel. 
[00:10:00]  Complete, I swear to you, complete regalia.  Sword, uh, bracers with knives in them.  Yeah.  Like, I was fully armed.  But people, you know, you can walk around the city with a sword and knives and you will  be arrested in a second.  But if you have a, if you dress as if you are in the Renaissance period, people smile.  They don't care that you have a weapon that can kill a crowd of people.  Because they probably think you have down, down syndrome and that you were at some kind  of summer camp.  My tongue did not look fat in what I was wearing. 
[00:10:30]  And, uh, then we went to the bar.  Yeah.  Up the, uh, at the corner, uh, over there on, uh, uh, 7th.  And, uh, again, dressed in full regalia.  Walked into the bar.  With weapons.  Ticked my hat.  Yes.  Greetings, everyone.  Greetings.  An ale for me and my party, please.  But, but, people, I brought a smile to people's faces. 
[00:11:00]  You know you're going crazy, right?  He's losing his mind.  No.  He's slowly but surely going crazy.  It was, it was funny.  I had fun.  Oh, wait, who's that?  Uh, just a young lad dressed in his, uh, his, his, his Renaissance outfit.  I'm looking at the pictures on the website.  Yes, there are some pictures available on, uh, Wack Bag, I believe.  You see a couple you don't like, you get mad at the girl, you call her a surf lover.  Yes, indeed.  So then what happened? 
[00:11:30]  Well, um, you know the food at the Renaissance Festival?  Oh, yeah.  Not the best food.  Well, big turkey legs.  What else do they serve?  Yes, yes.  I remember going once back in the day, it was turkey legs.  It was a, they call it steak on a steak.  There's, see, there's, um, a steak strips, and they put it on a skewer, a wooden skewer,  and they call it steak on a steak.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Okay, terrific.  And everything is just doused in grease.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  French fries and cheesy stuff, and just awful stuff for you.  So, uh, I opted to stay away from the unhealthy food, and just drank a beer.  A beer?  A beer.  A beer an hour?  A beer every 15 minutes.  It was a few beers.  We had a lot of fun.  I don't know how he has such willpower, this guy.  Right.  Stays away from the bad food, yet he gambles a quarter million dollars, and drinks alcohol.  Right.  The willpower.  We all need our vices.  And then drives really fast back to Manhattan, dressed like a pirate.  No, I didn't drive. 
[00:12:30]  Or whatever.  I did not drive.  I'm not silly anymore like that.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  But, uh, the food, very bad.  And, uh, of course, uh, my girl is a vegetarian, so it's very hard for her to find something to  eat, so she was eating them French fries.  And, uh, she's had, uh, problems with gallstones.  Oh, boy.  Over the, um, past few months.  And that food set it off.  So, here I am at the hotel, uh, here in New York City, um, yesterday morning, completely 
[00:13:00]  feeling like crap.  It's 7.30.  I think I got to sleep at 2.  We had been, uh, you know, we had been, uh, drinking, uh, during the night.  And I was pretty hungover.  And she's up going, ah, I'm getting that pain again.  And I know if it starts, it's just going to get worse.  So, loaded up the car, uh, the truck real quick.  And drove back to, uh, Long Island.  To, uh, the, uh, emergency room.  And by that time, she was hurting pretty bad.  So, they did all the tests that they do. 
[00:13:30]  But they did it, like, three months ago.  And she knows that there's a problem with that and everything.  And finally, after maybe 10 hours of sitting in a room.  But they were doing tests.  And they gave her some good, you know, stuff to stop the pain.  So, that was good.  Uh, they decide, well, you know something.  That's just got to come out.  That's got to come out.  The gallbladder.  So, now, uh, I sit here waiting.  And, um, she's, uh, in the, uh, hospital.  Wait, they're taking her whole, the gallbladder's coming, the whole thing? 
[00:14:00]  And they just take them out.  Yeah, you don't take a piece of that.  They're like nothing.  You either take it all or leave it.  It's a little, it's a little thing.  What is a gallbladder?  What do you do with it?  You even need it.  I think it's like a, like if, if you let a plum, like, just dry in the sun all day.  That's what it looks like.  I think, I think that's what a gallbladder looks like.  And it's useless.  It just gets stones in it.  Yeah, a gallbladder.  It's got some stones in there.  A gallbladder is pretty much useless in this day and age.  Yeah.  So, uh, last, you know, it was, uh, the whole day Sunday. 
[00:14:30]  It's funny you say that the food kicked it off.  Because, uh, back in the day.  It always does.  Uh, as a little family thing, we went to Kentucky Fried Chicken.  And my dad, like, keels over in pain from the greasy food.  It set off his gallbladder attack.  And he had his gallbladder out.  My sister Dawn.  She had hers out.  The Reverend Dawn, whatever she is.  Performing weddings for people.  Dawn Moon.  Dawn Sun.  Dawn Moon, right.  Sun Young Dawn.  She, uh, she had eaten some, uh, Chinese food. 
[00:15:00]  And, uh, I, I guess something greasy.  Egg rolls and stuff.  Yeah.  And wham.  Had to go and have it taken out.  Wait, how does grease, I don't understand how it works.  I don't really understand.  I think greasy food makes, kicks your gallbladder into, like, high gear.  It, it, like.  Yeah, this would.  It ejects something in there to, uh, help break down the grease or something.  Yeah, the gallbladder just, uh, makes weird noises.  Like.  Yeah.  Squishy noises.  And if there's. 
[00:15:30]  This is what your gallbladder does inside you.  Quack, quack, quack, quack.  And if there's stones in there, they can block up the duct that the, quack, quack, quack.  It's supposed to come out of, and then it gets all inflamed, and it hurts like hell.  It's like having kidney stones or any other kind of stones.  If you have no gallbladder, nothing changes, though.  No, you just, uh, I think you gotta watch, you know, you can't eat crappy, fatty food.  You know, you'll have a problem digesting it.  Oh, okay.  So, uh, you know, that's, like, no more horrible renaissance fair food. 
[00:16:00]  You know?  Vegetarian, eat vegetables.  If a vegetarian has to worry, that's depressing, because that's eating pretty healthy.  Yeah.  When you're a vegetarian, you eat fairly healthy, and if that's not even good enough, it's like,  what's the thing?  Just eat ice cream, and we should all kill ourselves by the time we're 50.  Some people.  Yeah.  But some people are just cursed with a bad gallbladder.  Well, that's what it is.  Our whole family, every single one of them.  Bad gallbladders?  The mother, the father, the whole, and to this one.  Yeah, bad gallbladders.  Are they just piling them up in a jar?  That's it.  Saving them.  Big gallbladder jar. 
[00:16:30]  Put it in the jar.  The family gallbladder jar.  Plop.  There's some more dried than others.  But, uh, yeah, so, um, that was, uh, that was all day Sunday, just sitting there.  And nothing, uh, more entertaining than sitting in an emergency room.  Hungover.  Hungover.  No, no, uh, comfortable bed.  And just watching, watching people.  Since you gotta go for some, uh, test, uh, where they give you some kind of radioactive 
[00:17:00]  stuff and then you lay under a machine and it scans you for two and a half hours.  As I tried to sleep in a chair that I recall from third grade being in my desk and a couple  of blankets over me and was curled up to the point where I think when I stood up, they rushed  me into surgery to fix my scoliosis they thought I had.  I was hunched over.  I said, no, no, I was sleeping in a chair.  How many times did the doctor try to wheel you away thinking you were the problem? 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  Because you were hungover and not looking good.  I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm sleeping there.  Doc, here he is, here he is.  They're rolling it down the hallway.  I finally got a room so I got, I got to watch Patton.  I watched Patton and then, uh, and I was, I was sitting there at about 11 o'clock AM thinking  there's no way we could still be here by like seven.  I pushed it.  I was like seven.  I'll finally be home laying in bed.  And then like seven, 10 was there and I'm like, oh, was I wrong?  Oh, was I wrong?  So then the doctor and this, the surgeon and stuff come over to consult and everything. 
[00:18:00]  We speak to them and he goes, well, we're going to, you know, admit you and, uh, uh,  we'll do this tomorrow.  No, first we'll do a sonogram, make sure everything's, uh, you know, it's the last phase of all the  tests and then, uh, we'll go in and yank that out and do it to a laparoscopic, laparoscopic  surgery these days.  That means they go into something.  No, no.  It means they don't cut.  They don't make a big cut.  Yeah.  They don't make a cut.  So they have to go in somehow.  No, they go in, but they go in with very small instruments so it doesn't leave scars. 
[00:18:30]  But how do they get it out then?  How do they get it out?  They squeeze it through a little.  They yank it out.  They yank it out through the tiny, tiny, tiny.  Very tiny, almost little incision.  Yeah.  Uh, and, and they just, and they go in with a camera and little instruments that snip and do  things and then, and then they take it out.  It's amazing.  But if it's, if it's like a plum thing, how do they stay?  Oh, but it's soft.  It's like a rat going under a door.  Oh, yeah.  What a way to operate on people. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, I know.  It's amazing.  They get a hold of it with tweezers and pull it out.  That place is something.  I won't mention it or something, but unbelievable new, new technology.  I'm amazed.  You go into these, uh, emergency rooms and all of a sudden I was like, I thought that window,  I thought the whole, the whole front of it is glass and, and, uh, of, of everyone's room  and the door is glass and everything.  It's like, not much privacy in this room.  And then you flip a switch.  The whole window turns white. 
[00:19:30]  It's like Star Trek.  Nice.  It's like, electrical.  They finally get it out.  They finally use the bathroom technology for something useful.  You go into trendy, like restaurants and they have that technology.  And I was thinking to myself, when are they going to use this for something useful?  Something good.  Right.  And then the, uh, if you have to get an x-ray, they don't have to drag you up to x-ray guy  comes around with the machine itself, goes from one room to the other x-raying people  like they really got this down.  Yeah.  Figure this crap out.  And, uh, well, uh, finally with, uh, this whole thing, I have not slept, uh, in a while. 
[00:20:00]  Uh, I actually crapped out on her bed in her room.  She finally got a room and, uh, like fell asleep on the bed.  And, uh, I guess they left me.  They shut the curtain and left me in there.  They were pretty cool about it.  And, um, I woke up with no alarm, luckily, at 4.30 and just whizzed right here.  And if you check those pictures that you looked at earlier, Iraq, the ones before I got dressed 
[00:20:30]  in my Renaissance gear, you'll find me wearing this.  That's what you were wearing Saturday.  You're up to Monday, man.  No, I was wearing this, um, wait, yes, Saturday.  But here's the thing.  Please, did you change your underwear?  I changed out of it.  Not that we care, but.  I, I, I changed out of it to put on my Renaissance gear.  So I wasn't wearing this long at all.  Are you free balling right now?  No.  Oh.  I, I, I, um, I had my Renaissance gear on, which would have looked very silly. 
[00:21:00]  I was thanking God that I did bring, um, clothing and didn't get dressed in my other Renaissance  gear before I went because I would have looked silly sitting in the emergency room with Renaissance  wear on.  It would have put me into psych, I believe.  He thinks he's a knight.  Oh, here's the Alzheimer's patient.  I hear they go into the belly button.  Huh?  They go in and through the, the belly button, no?  What are they, aliens?  I think they untie the belly button, get in there.  Untie it?  Yeah.  And then they tie it back up. 
[00:21:30]  There's no untying of belly button.  It's called laparoscopic surgery.  Doctor's going to put his big toe on the belly button.  All right.  Put your thumb here.  Hold it.  They tie it back up and they push it back in.  All right.  How long are you out of commission for when you get your thing?  It's not.  The surgery is an hour, about an hour, an hour and a half.  And then, uh, they hold you for one day to make sure, you know, everything's fine.  And then you go home.  Okay.  And then you're back to rocking and rolling, right?  Yeah.  So you'll be leaving the show. 
[00:22:00]  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much after this or if, uh, sooner, if I get any call, because, uh, they were going  to do the, uh, sonogram this morning at some point and then, uh, surgery.  And of course I got to be there.  I'm not like a, I'm not an idiot.  Yeah.  I'm going to sit here doing a, uh, uh, S's and giggles show while my girl is, uh, having  surgery.  All right.  You're a better boyfriend than I am then.  Why?  What would you do?  Just like, Godspeed.  But even if I wasn't like, I'm doing a show, even if it was like a Saturday and she  didn't get surgery, I'd probably be like, baby, call me as soon as you're done. 
[00:22:30]  Oh God.  You don't want her, you don't want her opening her eyes in recovery and the first person  she sees is you, Jimmy.  No.  No?  I wouldn't want to see me.  No.  If I woke up from surgery, I'd want to see doctors.  Let's see how my clockwork are and you just open your eyes and there's like five smart  looking people.  I wouldn't want to see my fat head over her.  Arguing.  We'll flirt with the male nurse.  I was making sure there were none of them on the floor holding the pillow. 
[00:23:00]  Fat guy in blue scrubs and a creepy beard.  Can I have an extra pillow, please?  Yeah.  Just walking the hallways with a big blue pillow.  You see him at night, like at two in the morning, just creepily walking the halls with a blue  pillow.  He has a bumper sticker on him and says, the heaven express.  All right.  We got to take a break, but that's the deal.  So Ant's going to be leaving the show sometime this morning.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll all just leave the show sometime this morning.  I, uh, first of all, we will not be taking awful gallbladder surgery stories, you dumb 
[00:23:30]  Fs.  No, they're just like, I just had my gallbladder out.  That's fine.  But then it's always going to turn into, these are what I call the club soda Kenny calls.  Well, it's, uh, you know, routine surgery, but things happen.  Well, Pete and Buffalo got gallbladder taken out.  You have awful dumps afterwards.  Well, wonderful.  So your chick's going to have awful dumps.  It was, I never said if she did or didn't now, she eats a lot of broccoli.  You know how I know mine does?  Cause while I was in the shower, she's on the bowl the other day in San Francisco. 
[00:24:00]  You've reached that point in the relationship.  It was odd.  I got out and I caught her.  I'm like, were you eating matches?  It's all that sulfur in here.  What's the matter with you?  Wow.  She must have had to go.  Oh gosh.  She ran.  I was, I was in the shower and I didn't even know she snuck in there.  Yeah.  And the next thing you know, I came out of my shower.  I'm ready to enjoy this steamy bathroom.  Yeah.  And I realized that she has come in and committed an atrocity.  And in the steam, it's even worse.  It's awful.  It just carries it.  Women are so strange, man. 
[00:24:30]  Like when you live with a girl, you'll just close the door and do what you have to do.  I don't know when my chick goes to the bathroom.  I have no idea.  Like she schedules it around the time I'm out of the apartment, I guess.  Or gets up, maybe sets the alarm in the middle of the night.  I don't know what she does, but I've never seen her go.  Wow.  That's good.  And I don't mean actually go, but I've never seen the door close while I'm in the apartment.  I don't know when she goes.  No clue.  That's good.  And not one fart.  The girl's got to keep up that whole illusion. 
[00:25:00]  Why can't guys do that?  Because we're disgusting guys.  Like my chick hasn't let one fart go in almost three years.  Wow, that's nice.  She probably has, but you didn't know.  She's probably really good at blaming other things.  Like she probably will.  Like she'll always make sure that you're walking by a garbage.  Like a big dog.  Yeah, there you go.  She'll probably drop one there and go, oh my God, this garbage is awful.  Garbage stinks.  That's what I mean.  They could figure all that out.  The entire drive down to Atlantic City.  You can just keep blasting them.  Blame it on Jersey.  Her stomach's rumbling and she can't wait until you hit 13A. 
[00:25:30]  I'll let her rip.  All right.  So why don't we take a quick break and we'll continue.  So we'll blow off the gallbladder stories for you, Ant.  Yeah.  I don't need to hear any more about it.  Hang up if you've got a gallbladder story.  I've heard enough about the gallbladder.  Yeah.  All right.  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show for a Monday. 
[00:26:00]  Phone number 877-212-O-N-A.  What's going on in the world today?  I can't get enough of Tiger Woods.  I know you guys aren't huge golf fans, but.  Oh, I like the golf.  What he's doing is just incredible.  He won his 13th major over the weekend.  Jack Nicklaus.  Jack Nicklaus got the record at 18.  Tiger Woods is four years ahead of that.  Yep.  Four years ahead of Jack Nicklaus' pace. 
[00:26:30]  I watched him make his little speech yesterday after he won.  And, you know, it's like, what else is there to say?  He won again.  Yeah.  It's like the Yankees.  I mean, it's like the Cowboys of the 70s and the Steelers.  Like, oh, him again.  He is great.  You know what's amazing about Tiger Woods?  He changed the game, obviously.  Revolutionized the thing.  The equipment got better.  The guys got stronger.  The guys started.  Oh, oh.  The guys started taking care of themselves.  Golf used to be like a middle-aged, you know, pot belly.  You know, you had Jack Nicklaus and a bunch of these guys. 
[00:27:00]  But now they're all athletes.  And they all kind of caught up to Tiger Woods as far as how they're preparing for the game  and the equipment and everything.  And he's still winning like crazy.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  I can't take away until the steroid charge is in golf.  Wow.  He hit the ball 1,700 yards.  He's strong.  He works out.  Hole in one on a par five.  They're raising some eyebrows, though.  I mean, he's like, he's jacked.  And only the last couple of years, he really, really got jacked.  Supposedly, bench presses like 300 pounds. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, he's ridiculous.  He's an animal.  And then the dumb Yankees are catching up to the Red Sox.  Yeah, that's what they do.  You guys are having a hell of a month of August.  They're on a nice little streak.  And, by the way, they chopped it way down.  What were they down at one point?  Like 14 games down?  Now there are only four behind the Red Sox.  Four behind the Red Sox.  Because the Red Sox, at this time in the season, always start their choke.  And the Yankees know when to start their rally.  And this just always happens. 
[00:28:00]  So, I'm looking forward to...  I'm more pissed off that I was looking at the standings.  Your dumb Yankees, they have a better record than my Mets.  Yeah.  How did that happen?  How did that happen?  The Mets were way ahead of the Yankees as far as, you know, win losses.  Turned it around.  The Yankees will start their choke in the first round of the playoffs.  Yes, exactly.  When the stupid big-name pitchers goes up and gives up nine runs because he's 51.  And Steinbrenner just kind of wanted him.  And when A-Rod won't be able to get one hit the entire series. 
[00:28:30]  Eight, eight, eight, two, bounce ground out for A-Rod.  A pop-up for A-Rod.  Stupid John.  Mid is high.  Mid is foul.  Stupid John Sterling.  When was A-Rod last year in the playoffs?  Two for 24 or something like that?  That was horrific.  He was just so awful.  Horrible.  Man, what a swing he took.  He starts trying to find some type of lemonade. 
[00:29:00]  Good eye, May Rod.  Ball for the Yankee walks.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Can we play that news clip?  This is the greatest newscaster clip.  Amazing.  We're getting there, Jimmy.  We're getting there.  We've got to at least mention the space shuttle Endeavor.  Because I am so psyched to hear that, too.  Yeah.  Yes.  Just trying to get the headlines out there.  That's all.  Well, the big story.  Are we heading toward another space shuttle disaster?  I don't know.  It's very, very dangerous. 
[00:29:30]  It seems that...  It seems the...  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  I know.  What?  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  What?  It seems that the...  Spatial Endeavor.  ...has a problem.  Yeah.  Uh, one of the, uh, heat, uh, shield tiles on the bottom of the, uh...  Spatial Endeavor.  ...has a huge gash in it.  About three inches by, uh, two inches and very deep. 
[00:30:00]  They're saying right to the skin of the...  Spatial Endeavor.  Yes.  So, uh, coming through, uh, the atmosphere, that could, could be a problem.  So what they're going to do...  A problem with...  With the...  Spatial Endeavor.  Yeah.  Uh, okay.  Right, right, right.  Uh, so they're going to have to send a couple astronauts out, uh, to, uh, fix the hole in  the bottom of the...  Spatial Endeavor.  Yeah.  Uh, because it's very dangerous.  If they come through, it could be, um, like, uh, the Columbia, uh, and bursting into flames, 
[00:30:30]  and we wouldn't want to see that happen to, uh, the...  Spatial Endeavor.  How about enough with the tiles?  They suck.  The tile thing, the guy should have just been fired.  Your idea stinks.  Why don't they stop going to Fred's Tile Shop for a tile?  Find a better tile manufacturer.  It's always the problem with them.  Always the tiles.  We, uh, discussed this last week, Jimmy.  It's like, why are we even still flying space shuttles with this, the huge fuel tank?  It seems like something's always falling off at the launch pad. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Knocking into the space shuttle.  I don't think there's been one launch.  Removing tiles.  Removing tiles.  And the big gouges are taking out of this thing.  Tiles.  I gotta get my bathroom guy in here.  Right.  To fix the tiles.  There's grout leaking in the atmosphere.  Yeah.  The grout.  The grout's getting old and just flaking off.  Needs new grout.  Gotta re-grout the space shuttle.  It's such a, just a horrible idea.  Those things are always breaking off, but something came off of the, um, fuel tank, of course. 
[00:31:30]  Are they lucky they made it into space with this, uh, with this goug?  No, you'll make, you'll make it in.  It's all about coming back in.  It's all about coming back.  Gotcha.  You'll make it out there to where, you know, you can't live without air.  Right.  It's the coming back that's rough.  Can't they just go to the space shuttle and dock for a little while?  What, the station?  Space station, yeah.  Uh, they would do that if they weren't there already.  Oh, they're now?  How do I know?  Wait.  Oh, she's, oh, they found, they already launched. 
[00:32:00]  I didn't realize that.  Yeah, yeah, they launched.  They took a little look.  Wait, what launched?  The.  Spatial Endeavor.  Oh, hold on.  Spatial Endeavor.  Right, right, right.  Spatial Endeavor.  And they're docked to the space station?  Yeah, they were dropping off a truss.  So now what happens?  Do we have to, uh, like, uh, launch another space shuttle to rescue the, uh.  No, they'll get a couple, because now they have a contingency plan for, uh, uh, holes.  In the shuttles.  Yeah.  And, uh, now they're going to send a couple of the astronauts out to the bottom of the.  Spatial Endeavor. 
[00:32:30]  And, uh, if need be, they have a couple of options.  They have pieces of tile.  Uh-huh.  They have, um.  Some grout.  Some type of caulking stuff that they can use.  Um.  But doesn't the caulk just fly off into, like.  Oh, no.  They know how to do that.  Everland.  I don't know why.  Like, but into, like, zero gravity land.  I call it Everland.  Uh.  Or they can use some kind of, like, spackle-like stuff that they scoop into the hole and hope  it, uh, stays in there.  Yeah.  You know, it's just, this being on the bottom of, uh, the. 
[00:33:00]  Spatial Endeavor.  It's kind of rough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because the bottom is the place that takes the most heat.  All right.  Bottom, uh, front, and the leading edge of the wings.  Those are the places that really.  They're saying this repair is very dangerous.  Why?  Uh, what, to do?  Yeah.  Uh.  No, this one in particular.  I mean, they, they, they work on the shuttle all the time, but they said.  Yeah.  Well, usually you're in the cargo bay.  Yeah.  Uh, when they do any work.  They're, they're rarely outside of the thing unless they're, uh, hooking up something to 
[00:33:30]  the station or, uh, putting something together.  Uh, but this, they're usually in, in plain view of everything.  When they have to go to the bottom of the shuttle, you really can't keep a good eye on  them, except with one camera on the robot arm, which they kind of modified to be able  to hook around to look underneath.  But you're on the bottom of this thing.  It's like being under a car.  No one can really see you.  And, you know, you're pretty exposed to everything.  Do you think the astronauts, as they're out there, they kind of take a peek to the left  and go, that, that goes forever. 
[00:34:00]  That would freak me out.  Oh my God.  I'd be like, just get me back on.  I'd be five inches away from what I'm working on.  Yeah.  Just staring at it.  Yeah.  Because the second you look off, you know, when you're, you're, you know, scuba diving  OB, please.  Yeah.  You've been there.  And you ever look off.  That's what I'm.  And just go like, that goes till I can't really see anymore.  And it pretty much goes around the world.  I basically go, that goes until Spain.  Yeah.  That goes until Spain.  And there are monsters in there and everything.  But if you look out into space and go, that's infinite. 
[00:34:30]  You could lose your mind.  There's no end that way.  If something happened where I just kind of got flung off of this and headed in that direction,  I'd go forever and ever.  You're also moving at 17,000 miles an hour.  Yeah.  I think is what the speed is.  And there's nothing to slow you down.  Like if you hit a bump when you're, when you're reentering, you will bounce off.  Like you, you can bounce and keep going.  So if something goes wrong and you fling off that station, there's nothing to even slow 
[00:35:00]  you down ever.  You will go at that speed until you hit a rock.  You're done.  But you're dead after three minutes anyway.  No, you're not.  No, no.  With your space suit on?  Oh, you'll have your space suit on.  Oh, how much air do you got?  Oh, I don't know.  I'm going there.  Enough to freak out.  Enough to probably watch it get pretty small depending on how fast you're going.  Yeah.  Enough to get out there and realize, like, how are they going to find me?  Oh, God.  Yeah, this, there, wow, there is no plan for getting me.  The shuttle's no good.  It's docked.  Yeah.  I'm done. 
[00:35:30]  You think there's monsters out there too?  You would hope.  Just floating around.  Eating one.  Just eat you.  You'd be done.  Oh, I couldn't look to my left.  Oh, my God.  Although, I don't think you'd really be able to reach escape velocity.  So you'd probably at some point get caught up again in Earth's gravity and just get pulled  into the atmosphere and ripped and burnt to shreds.  Within.  Crisp.  Half a second.  Yeah, it wouldn't take too long.  All right.  Yeah, Jimmy's talking about this.  It'd be a little flash of light and someone would go, oh, I'm going to wish upon a star. 
[00:36:00]  Meanwhile, you're wishing something stupid upon a star.  I would like a new car.  And there he is exploding, his head barbecuing as he's reentering the atmosphere.  That doesn't put any pressure on the tile fixing guy.  Well, if we don't have this, we're just going to kind of come into the atmosphere as a flaming  ball of wreckage.  Good luck to you.  Yeah, 200,000 feet.  Our lives are in your hands.  Here's a wrench.  Godspeed.  Here's some spackle.  Right.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, Jimmy was talking about this brand new news clip.  God, we can't get enough of these.  Why don't we play the original one?  Yep.  I mean, everyone has heard this by now.  Those are two guys, legendary newsmen from the Washington area.  We'll be in Washington, obviously, later this week.  We got the virus tour on Saturday, broadcasted live from Washington Friday.  Details to come.  Why don't we play the original, why they were laughing?  Basically, they were watching a video of a model falling in Paris or something, and these  two just lost their minds. 
[00:37:00]  This is fashion week over in Paris.  The latest fashions are on the runway for next spring.  But there was a problem out there today.  One of the British designers' shows had the difficulty.  A model fell down twice.  That's her going down once.  The young woman wearing that pink skirt and the orange platform shoes, never quite recovered  after that.  There she goes.  That had to hurt.  That was uncool.  That's embarrassing.  This is at least the second time. 
[00:37:30]  Well, you all are just really tickled by that, aren't you?  You try walking in those shoes.  Hey, first of all, baby, I got enough meat on me that it's all right.  George, thank you.  I'm sorry.  We want to apologize. 
[00:38:00]  Hold on.  He wanted to talk over the second fall.  Yeah, the fall is coming up again.  Hold on, hold on.  Yeah, he's like, don't write this for me.  Let's say this.  I want to watch this 20 times.  I think this one is just as cute a story.  Oh, this one.  This is cute.  Sometimes things like a model falling and stuff gets you laughing, and this is no exception.  Yeah, you know, the human interest stories will get some of these news anchormen just  losing their minds.  Well, we got a brand new one today. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, good.  Coming out of Nebraska, this is Jay Warren of WSLS Nebraska.  Listen to this one.  It's just too much fun going on in that newsroom.  A fire crash leaves three people dead.  Police in Nebraska say a rental truck carrying two people lost control, crossed the median,  and collided head on with a semi-truck.  Both trucks burst into flames, and witnesses say there were several explosions.  Excuse me.  The two people in the real truck and the driver of the semi. 
[00:39:00]  This is a sad story.  Excuse me.  We're killed.  Crews say they had fires contained in about 10 minutes.  Why was this guy laughing?  Do we know the answer yet?  I'm just speculating.  It might have just been because it was such a complete disaster.  It's like an action movie.  Come on.  They collide, burst into flames, three explosions.  I don't know.  Why wouldn't he pass this to someone?  When you realize you know where you have to go with this, why wouldn't you go, excuse  me, just improv and get through your plan? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, just kind of go like, excuse me, can Bill take the story?  I have something in my throat.  You can't finish that story.  A big laugh.  But if you get that laughing attack, there's nothing that can stop it.  You just get really silly.  Do we have an answer why the guy was laughing?  Wouldn't it be funny if his response was, I read what happened and it just struck me  as funny?  It doesn't even try.  It just really struck me as funny.  He's apparently an award-winning journalist.  He's been at this place since 98. 
[00:40:00]  And he's like an anchor.  I mean, he's not just like, you know, he's like a real news anchor.  And oof.  They didn't fire him?  I don't know.  It doesn't really say here.  People are very sensitive these days.  Yeah.  Well, to me, if you're a newscaster and you're laughing through a head-on collision story,  you should be fired.  Well, the job might not be for you.  But yeah, your job is to do those stories and not laugh.  Right.  And act concerned because they don't care.  He's a shock news guy.  Yeah.  Shock news.  Give us a new trend. 
[00:40:30]  Maybe just to try to get the ratings up or something.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'd love to know why he was.  Yeah, we'll try to find out.  If anyone knows, please give us a call, okay?  Didn't he apologize later in that newscast or something?  Oh, they always do.  I mean, do we have any information?  They have to.  They have to.  They have to do a follow-up.  Well, this is just hitting the old.  The wire.  The old wire.  So hopefully we'll have more info on that.  I want to hear that again, though.  You bet I do.  Absolutely.  Listen where he goes.  He said something and then pauses.  He realizes he can't stop his laugh. 
[00:41:00]  And then realizes, too.  Oh, no.  There's no way I'm getting through this.  He couldn't shake it.  A fire crash leaves three people dead.  Police in Nebraska say a rental truck carrying two people lost control, crossed the median,  and collided head-on with a semi-truck.  Both trucks burst into flames, and witnesses say there were several explosions.  Excuse me.  The two people in the world.  The two people in the world are trying to do this too much.  This is a sad story.  Excuse me.  We're killed. 
[00:41:30]  We said they had tires contained in about 10 minutes.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  You have to be panicking internally when that's happening.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because you understand.  You're a news guy on camera, live. 
[00:42:00]  Laughing at a multiple death story.  A head-on collision story.  Yeah.  Flaming wreckage story.  You couldn't pick a worse story to laugh at.  Unless children were involved.  Literally, nothing worse than a head-on fiery wreckage story to laugh at if you're a news guy.  All right.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  Get over there, Iraq.  I got a point to you.  Our phone number, 877-212-ONA.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:42:30]  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Looking at the box office here.  Very important to give the box office receipts every Monday.  Somebody out there is keeping track of this, I guess.  I have a little, a little, very little.  Huh.  A bit of faith in America.  Although, very little because of who is number one. 
[00:43:00]  And Rush Hour 3 is number one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  $50.2 million.  And, dude, all I heard, all I heard on any of the trailers, the ads on the radio that I've been hearing for this movie,  when they talk about the box office receipts and how it's number one, they play a clip of it on the news.  I heard it as I was driving in.  All they play is the interaction between a black gentleman and an Asian gentleman.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with the story, the action, the this.  The whole movie is based on, I will do a black stereotype, and it will be funny because I'm Asian, 
[00:43:30]  and I will do an Asian stereotype, and it will be funny because I'm black.  And if we did that same thing on radio?  Done!  We would have to be meeting with groups, there would be boycotts, there would be, there would be firings.  But because it's a black guy and an Asian guy, they can make all the jokes they want.  Well, how come the Asian groups aren't mad?  They always complain about people making parodies of Asian voices and stuff.  Why aren't they mad at Jackie Chan overdoing it and doing it for the movie and obviously purposely screwing up? 
[00:44:00]  Where is the problem?  And then Chris Tucker imitates him and does that and makes fun of him being Asian and makes fun of Asian stereotypes.  He slaps the guy, and this is in the trailer, he slaps the Asian guy and complains because he's short or something like that.  He goes, you're short, and if you did that on radio, they'd all be screaming and crying like a bunch of babies.  Yeah.  Because it's Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.  Because we would have some kind of agenda, see?  We're not trying to be funny and just entertaining people.  Because that's fun, and we would be hate radio. 
[00:44:30]  Right, right.  Doing it.  Instead of being a comedy show making a joke, it would be hate radio.  But if you do it on a big screen in a movie theater, you make $50.2 million.  It's amazing.  And no one complains.  It is amazing.  No one complains.  Unbelievable.  We truly are a comedy show just trying to entertain people.  But it's hate speech.  Maybe someday the special interest groups will understand that.  Yes, Dan.  I also remember from the trailer they have a character named me and a character named you and all the hilarious confusion that results in having those pronouns for a name. 
[00:45:00]  Are they both Asians?  Hilarious.  Oh, good.  Okay, good.  So Asian names, good.  What are they doing?  Like some kind of Abbott and Costello?  He goes, I'm you.  And he goes, what are you talking about?  You're me.  I go, no, no, not me.  I'm you.  That's me.  And Chris Tucker, like, can't figure it out.  Who's on first?  Oh.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Well, that's your number one movie this weekend.  Yeah, there you go.  And a movie we talked about a lot on Friday. 
[00:45:30]  All right.  I have to, you know.  Look at America differently.  Yeah, this kind of renewed my faith, even though Rush Hour 3 was number one.  I was wrong.  I was wrong.  I said that.  Thank God.  I said that we would all march to the movie theaters this weekend, not us, and most likely not most of our listeners, to see Daddy Day Camp.  It came in 10th place with only $3.6 million.  Ouch.  That means that movie is out of here. 
[00:46:00]  Another Cuba Gooding Jr. hit.  It's like, enough with the stupid.  Oh, he falls through the roof trying to fix the kid.  We get it.  It's tough.  The woods are nutty.  The raccoon.  Oh, no.  The kids, he fell.  Ah!  They're all yelling.  Ah!  Oh, he's in the lake.  Oh, he's...  Wait, it's a black Steve Martin face.  What's happening?  Were you listening to the show on Friday when you were away?  No.  We were trying to figure out all the stupid things that are in these movies.  We knew there would be a poison ivy gag.  We knew there would be some kind of outhouse gag. 
[00:46:30]  We knew there would be some kind of, like, innocent, like, animal that would scare the crap out of everybody.  The skunk.  A skunk scene.  It's got to be the skunk scene.  That was one of the critics reviewing it.  He's going to pew.  It stinks.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bill in Dallas.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Oh, boy.  Thank you.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, Bill.  Two quick items for you.  Yeah, you called.  I can't believe an Oscar winner couldn't carry the movie.  Yes, an Oscar winner. 
[00:47:00]  Yes, for as good as it gets.  And he certainly deserved it that year.  As good as it gets.  Even after radio, you'd think it would have built some momentum up.  Got it for Jerry Maguire.  Jerry Maguire.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought he played the gay guy and it was as good as it gets.  I thought he won for that.  That's right.  He won for Jerry Maguire.  My fault.  He had another movie where he could have won, you mean?  Yeah.  He's actually had two movies where he...  Oh, no, no.  I just mixed it up.  That was his first one, I think, after Jerry Maguire.  When he was still a promising actor.  And if he's going to win for anything, it should have been for Boys in the Hood because  he was great in that. 
[00:47:30]  All right.  Yeah.  He was great in that movie.  That's good.  Hey, Bill, let's go.  What do you got?  Hey, I just want to see the other thing.  I'm going to be in New York in late October.  No one cares.  No one cares.  Da-da, da-da-da.  No one cares.  I've been a faithful listener in Dallas.  No one cares.  No one cares.  I think he wants to...  I think he's trying to get an invite.  I think we should invite him.  We should be nicer to our listeners.  Just stop by and say hi.  What else do you got for today's show?  We've got a million people listening right now. 
[00:48:00]  What do you got?  No one cares that you're coming to New York, Bill.  Um, that's all.  I just had the day-to-day care.  Oh, and the...  I'm glad.  No, he's all bummed out, Bill.  Chill, man.  You've got nothing.  Chill.  We'll see you in October when you come to New York.  But what were you saying?  That daddy day camp bombed?  Yeah.  Did you go see it?  And the space shuttle Endeavor bombed.  Oh, my God.  I take it back, Bill.  Bill.  Don't let him come up.  How did it bomb? 
[00:48:30]  Bill, what happened?  Well, it's just not going good for the guys up there.  No, no, you.  What happened to you?  When did you realize?  That's pretty bad.  They're pretty bad.  Pretty bad up there.  Just trying to get in the door, guys.  Wow.  Well, he did good.  I think for worst call ever, you should get in the door.  I think Bill should be allowed up.  Yeah, you're up there.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Can I say I was watching the Honeymooners with the episode where he goes,  Hello, Bill.  Oh.  And when Gleason is sitting at his boss's desk and Mr. Monaghan walks in and catches him,  Gleason's the noise he makes is he puts his fat head to the side. 
[00:49:00]  He goes,  It's one of the funniest things anybody has ever done.  My favorite part of that episode is when Bill walks in with Norton and Karamda wants  to make it seem like he's been working.  So he's writing and he goes,  Hello, Bill.  And now he's got time to put his pen away in the pen holder on the desk.  Hello, Bill.  He's been working hard.  Oh, let's go to Steve in Montana.  Steve.  Yeah.  What's up, Steve? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, I've seen that wreck you guys are talking about in Nebraska.  It was a hell of a fireball.  Did you see the news clip?  No, I didn't see the news clip.  I'm a trucker.  Don't get to see much TV.  So you saw the crash that the news was talking about where the guy laughed?  Yeah, I saw the actual crash where he was laughing about it.  And what do you have to add?  That was over in Nebraska, over west of Sydney, or east of Sydney, Nebraska. 
[00:50:00]  And what do you have to add?  No Caller Monday?  I don't know what that is.  No Caller Monday.  See, that's why you need Phone Call Thursday.  Well, hold on.  Maybe he's got a good...  Sir, did you see the accident happen?  This is Your Call Sucks Monday.  My call sucks, huh?  Wait, sir.  Did you see the accident happen?  Wait.  Wait, why would you call a radio show just because you saw the crash that the news was  talking about, but you have nothing else to add except for the fact that it was a bad  crash, but we already know that?  Like, what could you add to this? 
[00:50:30]  Did you jump out of your rig and save somebody?  Yeah, I would think if you saw that and you could describe it, it would be a pretty good  story.  Yeah.  But, um, no, no, he can't describe it.  Big, boom, boom, boom, big, big.  Showing footage of the shuttle coming back and what's going to have to happen.  When the shuttle comes back in, it's almost like you're doing a wheelie.  You're skidding back into the atmosphere and the entire bottom of the shuttle is just  on fire.  Look, another piece.  They got the video and everything. 
[00:51:00]  Another piece falling and hitting the shuttle.  Enough with this dumb technology.  Oh, and they show shuttle explosions over the years.  We could be heading for the trifecta.  No, they will make it.  This will not be a problem.  What would happen if they can't fix this thing?  They'll just stay on the space station.  They could fix it.  I think they're just going for good ratings.  I could fix it.  I think they've realized that the ratings are down with these space shuttle missions,  the launches, and they're coming back to Earth. 
[00:51:30]  So they're just like, ah, tell them there's a gash in there.  Yeah, now, who's not watching this thing come back to Earth?  And then you get to hold your breath at that crucial time because they tell you to  hold your breath at the crucial time.  Or is it?  And then you breathe a sigh of relief for?  Space shuttle Endeavor.  For the space shuttle Endeavor.  Endeavor.  Hey, speaking of movies, before we move on, very excited.  Superbad starts, what, Thursday, Friday?  Are they going early with this movie?  Sometimes they like to go early, get a little head start on the weekend. 
[00:52:00]  A little buzz.  I can't wait to see Superbad again.  And we had the star Jonah Hill in recently.  And it's just really quick.  We want to replay Jonah telling the story about his landlord, Carl.  Carl.  I actually have a crazy story.  You guys want to hear a two-second story about this?  I used to live in New York.  And my landlord, Carl, was this, like, kind of, like, big Italian dude.  And he never wore a shirt, even if it was, like, two degrees outside.  And he was from Queens.  And he would be, like, like, he was, like, all right. 
[00:52:30]  And then the first day I moved in, like, from that day on, after the first day,  every time I'd see, he'd see me or one of my friends walk into the building,  he would go, hey, look at these high-fiving faggots every time we walk in.  And I'd be, like, every time.  Like, he would just call me that.  And I'd be, like, man, like, what's Carl's deal?  Like, why does he call me that all the time?  So the year was up, and I was moving out, and I was, like, moving all my shit out.  And I was, like, hey, Carl, like, nice, you know, thanks for letting us live here.  You're a good landlord, you know.  I got to ask you, like, why, like, you know, like, why did you always call us, like, high-fiving faggots? 
[00:53:00]  Like, we just, like, want to know.  And he's, like, quiet for a second.  He's, you know, not wearing a shirt, obviously.  And he's, like, you know, when I saw you move in here, I saw you high-five one of your buddies.  That's what they call us.  That's it?  For a year.  For a whole year.  One high-five, and I was a high-fiving faggots for a whole year.  There he is, Jonah Hill from Superbad.  Let's say hi to Jim on Long Island.  Jim, what's up?  Jim. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, Dad, Jim.  Oh, my.  Jim.  What you got for the show, Jim?  Hey, Jim.  I'm here.  Well, you're not here because we said, hey, Jim, three or four times there.  Yeah, well, I'm kind of brainless right now.  You know, it's too early for me to be awake, but I was listening to your show.  Too early to be awake, but not early enough to call Opie and Anthony and ruin the flow of their show.  Thank God.  What do you got, Jim?  I'm so glad you took that into consideration.  You were talking about Russia.  They were making fun of Asians, and that's why you can't do it.  They weren't actually making fun of Asians in that commercial.  They were making fun of the French.  And while the Asians were speaking French. 
[00:54:00]  Well, the French, the one he did in the French, he's like, he's talking about French girls  where he's naked or something like that.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  The guy, he smacks the Japanese guy.  He's like, why are you talking French?  Why are you humiliating yourself like that for?  But didn't he slap and say something about him being short?  No, it was for speaking French.  Jack, you're like, you're speaking French.  You're like, why are you humiliating yourself and smacks the guy?  All right.  Well, whatever.  He's still, all right.  I think you'll find other scenes.  There was something about him being short, though.  It's not an Asian joke.  It's a dumb French joke. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  That's better.  Well, okay.  No wonder they didn't care.  Fine.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  No problem.  Let's go to Tom in Boston.  Boston, help us out today.  What do you got?  Hey, isn't that a Nicole Kidman movie coming out where the space shuttle crashes to Earth  and the aliens come down with it?  Yeah, but how did the aliens get in the space shuttle?  Wouldn't they have had to fly it?  I don't know.  Like, we have cameras.  Wouldn't we know the point where the aliens come onto the space shuttle?  They got in there.  And come back to Earth? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, like, what do you do if you're on a space shuttle and you hear...  Oh, my God.  Open the door.  Who is it?  It can't be good.  Yeah, open the door.  See who that is.  If you see headlights heading towards you when you're on the shuttle, just avoid it.  Don't stop.  Maybe they're broken down, honey.  There are things you should never encounter when you're on the shuttle.  Headlights.  Headlights coming at you.  Exactly.  Somebody honking at you from the back.  Nah, nah.  He wants to pass.  Wave them around.  Open the window and wave them around. 
[00:55:30]  We're going too slow.  Wouldn't it be funny to be an obnoxious space shuttle driver and you're just honking and  high-beaming the person in front of you?  You have infinity to go around.  Yet you're pissed off.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to...  You know, now I'm obsessed.  We're going to try to get one good phone call.  Frank in New York.  What's up?  It's going to happen.  I'm listening on 92.3 K-Rock.  What's up, Frank?  Hey, Dopey and Dopey.  What's going on, man?  Hey, did you guys check out what's his name?  Fave of Fave, the roast.  They ripped them up yesterday. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, it was a really good roast, actually.  Yo, beautiful.  We should get some clips of that.  This is the first time I ever saw it.  And they ripped up Bridget Nielsen.  The reason I called is I got a brand new car.  I don't know if you guys are interested.  Wrap in my car.  You know that paint job.  It's like plastic.  The way they do the eggs.  Dip it in hot water.  And it shrink wraps.  Advertisement for your show.  And who's going to pay for that?  You guys.  I got a 2006 Sion, man.  I drive to New York twice a month. 
[00:56:30]  I put 2,000 miles on my car every month.  I bought it with 120 miles on it in December.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, so, dude, you have a business that you do that.  You want us to, like, kind of pay you to advertise the show.  No, I don't have a business.  But what I'm saying, I see cars with advertisement,  Mellow Yellow and this and that.  I'm willing to have my car completely advertised.  With Opie and Anthony, I'll whip it out Wednesday,  whatever you want.  Your brother's freaking restaurant, 
[00:57:00]  little corner of the bumper, whatever.  How much?  I don't know how much it costs,  but if you guys do it,  I'm willing to have my car freaking just trash  to advertise your show.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Okay, he won't make anything off it.  He's saying.  He's selling spots on his car, though, like NASCAR.  No, no, no, no.  We won't pay him at all.  No, he wants us to pay for it.  He wants us to wrap his car in the Opie and Anthony logo  or what have you and pay for it.  I'll pay him for it, but not pay him anything.  I'm on the Cape.  I'm in Cape Cod, Massachusetts,  and I drive to New York. 
[00:57:30]  I do a lot of driving.  Right, right.  I do advertising.  I go to Rhode Island, Connecticut to New York.  I got family in Brooklyn.  So how much is it?  How much?  How much?  From my understanding,  it might run from like $800 to maybe $2,000,  depending on how much stuff you put on it.  $800 to $2,000.  That's quite a window.  There sure is, sir.  Yeah, but no, no.  If you want a lot of...  It could be like one solid color  and have your guy face his Opie and Anthony,  blah, blah, blah.  But if you put a lot of detail in it,  then it probably runs more money.  You know what I mean? 
[00:58:00]  I don't know if the company would go for it.  I don't know.  I don't know what would happen legally  if all of a sudden you're in a massive car crash  with an Opie and Anthony logo on it.  Do the research.  I'll give you my cell phone number.  If you're interested, give me a call.  All right.  What's your number?  508.  No, don't give it out over the air.  508.  That's funny.  Go ahead.  508-364-8509.  Hey.  All right.  I got no problem changing my number.  You don't want to have to change it.  I love the show.  You guys are great, but... 
[00:58:30]  All right, Frank.  I don't think anyone will call.  Don't worry about it.  We'll get back to you.  Thanks.  Let's go to Scott in New Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Did that guy just give out his cell number on our show?  What an idiot.  Anthony, I was wondering,  with your outfit,  was that the sword of the gay?  Uh, no, I was not wielding the sword of the gay.  The sword of the gay.  That made me laugh all weekend.  No, I had a rapier.  I had my rapier.  Did you?  Yes, of course I did.  We called it the sword of the gay on Friday, though. 
[00:59:00]  And then, uh, here's, here's, uh,  there's a couple of geniuses working the Renaissance Fair.  When you walk in and you have a sword,  Yeah.  Uh, they take a little black zip strip,  uh, that, like they had in the olden days,  and, uh, zip strip your sword into your,  your leather sheath,  your scabbard,  your sword holder.  You know?  Your what?  Your, your, your sheath.  No.  Your scabbard.  Your, your sword holder thing.  You know, the leather thing that the sword goes in.  Why would you just call it the sword holding thing? 
[00:59:30]  Why have they used, like, the,  a scabbard?  Because a scabbard also holds a, a rifle.  It's just the leather, you know.  It's the, the rifle holding thing.  A holding thing.  Why do you have to know the names of things all the time?  It's a holster for a sword.  Yeah, how about a sword holster?  A sword holster.  Not a scabbard.  And they, they zip strip your sword to that holster thingy,  so you can't pull it out and, and engage in, uh,  battle with people there.  They don't want swords coming out and, uh, you know, 
[01:00:00]  poking someone.  Well, the guy does it to mine,  but just wraps it around the sword.  So I walk in and go,  I don't think he,  and I pull,  and it comes right out.  So now you could have done damage.  I could have just.  The sword of gay.  Lopped some heads.  I wasn't carrying the sword of the gay.  It's known as the sword of gay, though.  I was not wielding that.  No one's going to remember rapier.  They're going to remember sword of the gay.  They do not.  I didn't even see anyone else wielding the sword.  Well, maybe a couple of people were wielding the sword of gay. 
[01:00:30]  Oh.  A hole.  All right.  Hey, uh, in other news, uh, Merv Griffin died.  We don't have much.  Oh, Merv.  82 years old, prostate cancer.  I'm just looking at his list of people he's had on there.  Oh, legendary talk show host, man.  He had, uh, presidents and everyone.  Did he have Martin Luther?  Was that Martin Luther King Jr.?  He, uh, back in the day,  Merv Griffin had everybody on his show, man.  He was like,  he was kind of like the Larry King.  Kind of like,  I think Regis kind of got his whole, like, thing.  Yeah.  From Merv Griffin.  He was a true pioneer. 
[01:01:00]  Merv and Mike Douglas had, like, similar shows.  Mike Douglas was the poor man's Merv Griffin.  Right.  Everyone knows that.  The poor man's Merv.  I hate when people say that.  And I just did.  I know.  He invented, uh...  Jeopardy!  Really?  Yes.  Yes.  He actually invented the game Jeopardy.  Came up with it.  Hmm.  How do you invent Jeopardy?  It's, it's, it's trivia questions.  I wonder if it's just trivia questions.  He just did it backwards.  But they give you the answers.  We do it backwards. 
[01:01:30]  And you have to come up with the questions,  which it really isn't.  Let's do it backwards.  You just gotta say, say what is or who is before.  It's really just a question.  Yeah, he, he, he,  and because he did it backwards,  he becomes a multi-billionaire, basically.  This producer's jaw is probably dropping about now.  Um, Merv Griffin?  No.  No.  What?  No, that takes time.  Oh, it does, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  His jaw's not dropped yet.  I wonder when he thought of the name Jeopardy.  Probably when his face was in a pillow. 
[01:02:00]  That music was going off in his head.  Hmm.  Ooh.  Does he?  Does he?  Does he?  Does he?  Hope not.  Hold on, we got,  We got Jennifer in New York.  Uh, Jennifer.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to say,  I'm getting bored of the Renaissance conversation.  You guys are boring me in my car.  I'm falling asleep.  Then turn on Scott and Todd, you bitch.  Hey, you,  you,  you stupid C-word.  We, we,  we spent one break on it.

What's 30?  Turn up your radio right now.  What's that?  No,  you're still listening to us.  You're still listening to us.  You lying bitch.  You lying sack of crap bitch. 
[01:03:30]  Go away.  Don't kill yourself.  Drive into a pole.  Drive into a pole.  Do everyone a favor.  Jennifer.  What an awful name.  Oh,  what an awful name that is.  Why?  Why?  Why?  What?  Why is it awful?  Short memory.  We've talked about the Renaissance.  Enough of her.  We talked about the Renaissance Festival that you went to for maybe two minutes during this  break.  Oh,  God.  And for about 10 minutes to start the show.  Maybe 15 to start the show.  I don't care.  What do you want to talk about? 
[01:04:00]  Dummy.  All right.  What does she want to talk about?  Her pals at the office?  Shut up.  What?  Whose D you took in last night?  Ugh.  Give my pal Anthony a break today.  He's wearing the same clothes from Saturday.  I've had it.  I'm going to melt down.  All right.  Merv Griffin.  So you got the Jeopardy.  He did the Wheel of Fortune.  He was the legendary talk show host.  And he sang I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts. 
[01:04:30]  This record sold three million copies, everybody.  Three million copies in 49.  One evening I was there when I heard a showman shouting underneath the flare.  I've got a lovely bunch of coconut.  And Merv would like two right on his chin.  Big one, small one, some as big as red.  Oh.  Yeah, this is a little different, thinking Merv wrote it. 
[01:05:00]  Coconuts.  Coconuts.  And all your throw will make me rich.  Who would buy this?  There, Stan.  Three million people in 1949.  Singing roll-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bole-a-bo

[01:12:30]  every time a jennifer calls up  anthony goes into a bit of a tizzy  because yeah  that's the name of his ex-wife  guys you know how that is right  just hate the name  hate it  also lots of sweepers being produced for the show today  from Tim down the hall  he's getting out of control  we talked about Merv Griffin dying over the weekend  prostate cancer 82 years old  and unfortunately it came in with this a little late  but we could have used this today  it's another ONA celebrity death 
[01:13:00]  cool  all right  I think he could have done a little more with that  what else to be done  I mean that was obviously hours of labor  Timmy sweats over this equipment  it's more about quantity than quality here  apparently  well if you didn't like that one  you might not like this one  you know when we were talking about the box office  Rush Hour what  made 50 million at the box office 
[01:13:30]  number one movie over the weekend  yep  Tim produced this  pew pew pew pew pew  it's the ONA box office report  I like that a lot  it's got everything you need  laser sounds made by the mouth  yeah  a film in the background  yeah  and it tells you what it is  it's all it needs  you're right  and of course don't forget  it's also  ringtone Monday  mania  feel good story Monday  and pot talk Monday  I think we already did the pot talk 
[01:14:00]  with the whole space  space shuttle endeavor  little space talk  where you look off  and get a little paranoid  that you're looking into infinity  yeah  you're looking into ever  I like to say  you're looking into ever  ever  it's pot talk Monday  do you think the astronauts  as they're out there  they kind of take a peek  to the left and go  that  that goes forever  that would freak me out  oh my god  I'd be like  just get me back on  on the Opie and Anthony show  dude that's trippy 
[01:14:30]  trippy man  why is the sweeper  about something  that we talked about today  but he produced that  like a while ago  whoa  what's up  how'd that happen  what's up with that  something's going on  I think I know  busy bee  Tim is magic  I guess he knew  what we were gonna say  he's got wizardry  Tim engages  wizardry  that's right  when he makes these sweepers  that's right  when he's not having his haircut  with retarded people  give me whatever it is  he has  what's wrong with his haircut  nothing 
[01:15:00]  it's a good haircut  is it  yeah  did he see Kenny's  did he have a haircut  yeah  did he get the front shorter  so it's more of a  in mullet  Kenny has the short  the shortest mullet possible  yeah  it's amazing  like oh  try to get a shorter mullet  than our own club  so did Kenny  it's not gonna happen  ever ever ever  it's pretty much a crew cut  with like a mullet thing  in the back  yeah  but but but but  but the back is like 
[01:15:30]  only like a quarter inch  yeah it's not that long  it's really strange  long enough though to qualify  I think Kenny has just  unusually like  his hair in the back  goes too far down  it goes down my neck  where he has to shave  a make believe  like end to it  yeah  yeah  I want to grow a tail  like remember the 80s guys  would grow like those  long rat tails  oh the rat tail  did you have one  no  I grew a little one  stop it  yeah  stop it  it was as wide as my pinky  and about half a pinky  oh  it was really lame  I'm gonna get one  the chicks digged it

[01:42:00]  happened to the blind  kitten i think i think  my brother's stuck with  the blind kitten because  he has a heart of gold  and now they don't want  to give up the blind  kitten  he's actually making  funny youtube videos  with the blind kitten  and like doing wacky  things that only kittens  with eyes should be able  to do because if they're  blind like milk or  gasoline is a fun game  he has two little  milk or gasoline  my brother now has a  three-legged dog and a  blind kitten  this is the type of  uh person he is  we should have him a  traveling virus for  in the village we  should have uh him  with all his wacky  animals  you know like the 
[01:42:30]  you know the well-hung  goldfish  he's just getting all  these odd things  animal freak show  nice  yeah i think uh my  brother's keeping the  blind kitten  although the listeners  came out of the  woodwork to try to  adopt it and take it  off his hands because  he's too busy doing  70 80 hours a week at  the restaurant there  yeah here's a fun game  to play with the blind  kitten like there's the  kittens walking towards  you you're really quiet  and it's stumbling on  its little kitten feet  and then when it gets  right by your face you  go  you play like whatever 
[01:43:00]  kitten music kittens  like like a little  tinkle a link  a tinkle a link like  a little music in the  back distracted and  then you scream at his  little dumb kitten face  it's pittering along on  its little paws  little padded feet  padded foot padded foot  padded foot  I can't see nothing  and then it gets  right in its face  and you watch it  scamper backwards on 
[01:43:30]  his padded foot  padded foot  and there's one animal  that shouldn't be blind  it's cat  oh not a cat  because they're skittish  to begin with man  yeah  poor thing  oh the poor little thing  and they like jumping  on things and he just  can't jump  where's he jumping to  just a flat wall  thinks there's a shelf  there because he thought  he sensed it  and he jumps and just  smashes into the wall  I know milk or gasoline  that's a fun little game  that he plays  two little  two little dishes  which one will  kitty drink out of 
[01:44:00]  milk or gas  or a comfy blanket  or tax  is a fun game  too  alright we got a cute  little story coming in  it's uh  it's uh feel good story  Monday right  oh it could be  sure  it's time for your  feel good story  ah good  these are pictures  of a 15 year old girl  taken detectives say  when her mom  picked her up  from summer camp  I just thought  oh my god  you know  what did they do to her  everything was so swollen  and so raw 
[01:44:30]  we've agreed not to reveal  the girl's name  or show her mom's face  on camera  investigators say  the teen was tied  to a rope  and dragged behind  a van  while she was  at a christian boot camp  detectives say  she was being punished  for not being able  to keep up with  other campers  out for a run  this was supposed  to be fun  it was supposed  to be a fun thing  and you know  a little bit  of a learning  experience for her  first of all  the room  the room  Anthony has broken 
[01:45:00]  out the boner  whistle today  I like that  I had just  the opposite reaction  I love the boner  whistle  yeah the longer  the story went  the happier I got  except for the fact  I don't like the way  the reporters said  they tied her to a rope  tied her to a rope  tied her to a van  because she wasn't  doing what she was  supposed to be doing  how else do you  discipline a child  yes  you can't hit them  no you tie them  to a rope  crushed glass  or tender vittles  that's a fun thing  oh look the little fellas  lapping at  crushed glass  he doesn't know  any better  poor little thing  you have some gas 
[01:45:30]  to wash it down with  shut your face  bad cat  Bill from Waterford  I like playing  with my blind kitten  he likes to play  catnip or poison  well  be a little more  creative  yeah they could  probably smell it  Bill  then again  I'm thinking  gas or milk  are indistinguishable  from one another  gas is funny  I'm thinking that  eyesight is all that  that tells you  not to drink gas  like you could be  at the gas pump  but it could just  easily be milk  you're smelling  cats have a better  sense of smell  than I do  even  I have a very 
[01:46:00]  good sense of smell  like if I'm on my  hands and knees  sometimes I'll be  naked on my  hands and knees  and just push my  butt up in the air  and I did that  with my kid  when I was a kid  I was holding  my cat's head  and I farted  on his nose  I don't know  why I was mad  but I'll never  forget holding  his head  and he's straining  backwards  to pull out  like picture  yourself squatting  and you're reaching  behind yourself  holding a cat head  not a happy cat  might I add  and he's backing up  like alright  what are you doing  and as soon as the nose  and the butt touch  he goes  he was not pleased 
[01:46:30]  oh that is an unhappy  little guy  he was just trying  to back out  because they can't  use their hands  to push your hands  away  so he's using  all four paws  and the cat  was scrunching  his face  so it's all wrinkly  he's pushing back  and I'm holding  his head  it looked like  he was wearing  a cone around  his face  and then he got  a nose full of  lesson  that's what happens  did you feel  his wet little nose  that's when I knew  it was time  to let go  we have  contact  wet little nose 
[01:47:00]  Aaron is suggesting  that my brother's  into civil war  pet care  let's get the hacksaw  he's got a splinter  cut off a limb  hey we're in the middle  of feel good story  Monday  let's get more  out of this one  dismissed  sir  carry on  today the man  who runs that camp  Pastor Charles Flowers  was arrested  at his church  here in San Antonio  before he was  taken away  we asked him  if he thinks  he's too hard  on the kids  they will tell you  in the end  no  in the end 
[01:47:30]  if he asked him  the first day  too hard on  they will say yes  he wouldn't talk  about the details  of this case  and wouldn't say  specifically  whether the girl  was dragged  behind a car  he did say  his tough love  approach  helps teens  to connect  with their purpose  and God  but the mother  of this girl  hopes he never  works with children  again  I think he just  goes too far  do you think  you know  and I think  that there's  a right way  and a wrong way  to get through  to kids  Pastor Charles Flowers  and a training  assistant  are charged 
[01:48:00]  with aggravated  assault  investigators say  Flowers drove  the van  while the girl  was tied  to the bumper  can I say  that when  someone says  did you tie  that child  to the bumper  and drive  the car  you should  always say  no  this should  never be  well I have  no comment  about allegedly  dragging the child  behind the van  no comment  no comment  and his name  is Flowers  Flowers  Chuck Flowers  what a doodle  retribution  I know what 
[01:48:30]  that was about  though  why  they put a rope  around her  and they just  kind of  were trying  to make her  run  probably drove  very slowly  very slowly  they weren't dragging  her I bet  it sounds really bad  like come on  keep up  keep up  and it's obviously  something you shouldn't do  but it was probably  like they tied a rope  to her and like  come on  come on  and to push her  a little further  and then she probably  fell down  even though the  truck was going  like no miles  those church groups  do some like  wacky things though  yeah  like obviously  you shouldn't be  doing that 
[01:49:00]  I know those  boot camp things  they get a little  raw with the kids  you know as far  as that  but I don't know  if this was like  one of those  boot camps  or some kind  of stupid  church outing  some friggin church  the only answer  you should have  when someone says  did you drag  that kid  did you tie that  kid to the bumper  and drive  no  right  never happened  that should be  the only  acceptable answer  no  well I might  you know  I don't want to  I can't get into that  alright  let me interrupt you  we got Craig  on Long Island  he has a little  cat game too  Craig what's up  hey what's going  on fellas 
[01:49:30]  hey  I like to play  string or live wire  that's a fun one  sometimes they get it  right  other times they don't  alright let's go  to Mark in New York  Mark what's up  good morning  I like to play  driveway  or a highway  it feels the same  to his little feet  full tar on his pads  hey that wasn't  your feel good story  obviously I was  no  I was just kind  of joshing  you were joking  I was joking  with everybody  here's your feel  good story  for feel good 
[01:50:00]  story Monday  a woman tries  to console  one of the owners  of harem family  hair care  shortly after  a brutal  morning robbery  left four women  most of them  grandmothers  badly beaten  horrible  she not  around here  disgusting  police spent  the afternoon  assessing the  bloody crime scene  marking spots  of blood  and taking photos  we're told  around 11  Friday morning  a man walked  into the business  demanded money  and immediately  started hitting  three customers 
[01:50:30]  and a co-owner  with a hammer  that one guy's laugh  you know he's  going to need  a cancer gazoot  in like a month  but that laugh  is perfect  oh we love that guy  we got to meet him  while we're down  in Washington  this weekend  oh yeah  that's a rule  Jerry Kishuda's  grandmother was  getting her hair  done  well I got home  for lunch  and my grandfather  rushed me out  the door  he said something  happened  there was a robbery 
[01:51:00]  three customers  and a co-owner  were rushed to  area hospitals  at least some  had been beaten  over the head  they called from  the hospital  and she was awake  and talking to them  police later found  the suspected  getaway car  she was awake  and boring them  a couple miles away  in Wilkesbury  it's now locked up  in a police garage  what a douche though  what the hell  are the old people  going to do  nothing  that's why  and she said  her hair never  looked over  no but I mean  no that's the point  of making  why would you  beat them with a hammer  what are they  going to do to you  see my take is 
[01:51:30]  why wouldn't you  you just  you know  you got to show  them who's boss  exactly  throw it in  that stupid dryer  what  what did he say  I don't know  what they're thinking  at that point  that's just a psychopath  who probably wanted  to beat people  with a hammer anyway  and this was just  a chance to do it  she wakes up  what  what's she speaking  doctor come here  let me  let me tell you  about my  grandchildren  ah  put her back  in a  medically induced  coma  want to hear 
[01:52:00]  about your  grandkids  old people  stories  stop it  I don't  he smashed  her head  her charm  bracelet  wrists  raced up  to protect it  chink  of the charm  with all of her  grandkids names  on each one  they're all  but all  all five of them  are just kind of  peeking up as the  hammer  smashes down  on that gray  that gray matted  head  how awful  her wigs  all askew  old lady wig  I hope one of the  ladies didn't have  that see-through  cotton candy 
[01:52:30]  hairdo  where they lost  hair so they  tease it up  but you could  see straight  through it  because that  doesn't offer  much protection  that hammer  will  it's going to  hit the skull  that's as thin  as rolling  paper  big old lady  lump  all right  here we go  we got a couple  things  thought it was  a feel-good  story  it is  there you go  after the break  we're doing  we have a special  guest calling in  he wrote a book  called the  charisma creator  yes  and it's a  definitive handbook

[01:53:30]  would be  really smart  well a lot  of people  are going to  have some  questions  for this  of course  so serious  questions  yeah please  keep the  goofiness  to a minimum  that's right  we are  asking you  please  serious  questions  only  for our  author  right  that  we're going  to have  on  the  charisma  creator  what  other things  are in this  book there  Jimmy  well it looks  like he's got  a thing  there was a  conversation  he had with  a woman  on the train  which he  kind of wrote  down from  memory  about how  he met  her  and he  used  humor  and he 
[01:54:00]  talks about  he thinks  people should  read his  book twice  from cover  to cover  and the  second time  you memorize  parts  you take  notes  and he  said that  going from  nothing  to being  a truly  charismatic  person  may take  up to  90 days  of daily  work  so there's  a lot  to get  into here  that's odd  that he's got  like a  schedule  like that  like 90  days  he has a  list of  some of  the smooth  moves  he used  within a  conversation  that's what  I want to  get to  and on one  page he  explains what  humor really  is and it's  more than  just being 
[01:54:30]  funny  and throughout  the book  he explains  how important  it is to  make sure  conversations  and dates  are fun  with a  capital  F-U-N  and an  exclamation  point  fine  so we  will see  what Andrew  Kaplan has  to say  about this  book called  The Charisma  Creator  looking forward  to it  serious  questions  yes  did you  do this  part about  the book  Andrew  thinks people  should read  his book  twice  yes I  did mention  that  okay  good  good  Jimmy  says the  same  thing  but he  doesn't  want you  reading  the same  book  twice  he  wants  you  to  buy  a  new  one  I'd  like  you  to  buy  two  copies  of  happy

[02:05:00]  I'm giving attitude  here  I'm keeping a  straight face  even though this  is funny  it's a good  back and forth  but you know  go between  because I'm  keeping a  straight face  it adds to  the level  of tension  and humor  and Andrew  you could get  a broad  doing that  oh yeah  wow  oh hell yeah  it's kind of like  that's how you do it  it's kind of like  you're going  what do I look  like to you  Jenny  it's kind of  like a  kind of like a  Clint Eastwood  meets Merv  Griffin  type thing  yeah I think  I was thinking  you know  Marlon Brando  something like that  ah Brando  sure  after 1980

[02:06:00]  wait let me  let me jump in here  and explain  what do you say  here  after she's like  what I  because she's  been taken  off guard  by this  by this  alpha male  approach  in parentheses  expecting  no doubt  in my voice  or body  posture  no no no  your info  my name  that's it  that's the deal  that's the end  of page 3  oh yep  ok now  now she says  you know what  trying to come up  with something 
[02:06:30]  to say  fine  fine  laughs  begins to write  on the back  of a business  card  I just  handed her  why didn't  she laugh  what's that  hold on  no  it says  here  like what  happened  is our  actress  is not  doing this  right  it says  she laughs  and so there  should be a  laughter  so read it  the way it  is stupid  but there's  nothing to  laugh at  ok read it  fine  fine  laughs  and starts  writing  and I go  see that  wasn't so hard  and her 
[02:07:00]  a pouty  look  come on  let's see your  pouty look  oh there  it is  that's adorable  I felt the  pouty look  from here  it's all good  and then you  do shit  in her hand  as trains  is coming to  stop  I'm Andrew  it was very  nice meeting  you  what did  you say  your name  was  get out  of here  Andrew  stretch his  word out  annoyed  but very  amused  I'm  Andrew  alright  listen  how does  that work  so yeah  this seems  like a whole  crazy thing 
[02:07:30]  here  yeah  explain how  that worked  well  basically  the situation  is this  most women  if they're  attractive  to at least  this  are literally  hit on  anywhere from  10 to 20  times a day  right  wow  and  figure  99%  of the guys  doing it  are doing it  wrong  right  now what's  wrong with  the way  they're doing  it  well hold on  you say  something here  which I  thought was  very interesting  what page  Jimmy  it was on  page  I don't  have a  page  148  you have  a list  by the way 
[02:08:00]  on page  206  give us  an example  of some  of the  smooth  moves  you've  used  within a  conversation  in the context  of this  conversation  smooth  move  what's that  I use  my  surroundings  ah  a 2x4  like if you're  behind a  planned  parenthood  you might  make a  stew joke  anything  that works  for you  guys  anything  yeah  humor is  important  right  it's  always  important  and you  never  hesitate  and you  always  make sure  it's  congruent  with who  you are  congruent  good word  could you  give us  an example 
[02:08:30]  of some  of the  smooth  moves  that you've  displayed  here  right  well I  used my  surroundings  like I  said  I was  different  because  you know  like we  were just  talking about  who has  the stones  to walk up  to a complete  stranger  an attractive  one  and tell her  she's got  no game  no one  well I'll tell you  one thing  like if you're  on the train  you might want  to make like  a Colin  Ferguson  like remark  that's a good  one too  something like  train humor  and that's  funny obviously 
[02:09:00]  you go with it  sure  train  like  give an example  oh I see  what you're  saying  give us  smooth  look at this  Andrew's  smooth moves  what page  it's on page  206  oh boy  I wish I could  read that  give us a couple  give us an example  here  well besides being  different I also  use what I like  to call  role reversal  right  it sucks  role reversal  yeah which again  it's another example  I guess  what you were  saying for earlier  yeah  usually we're in a  role where if she's  attractive well 
[02:09:30]  most guys are  saying okay she's  a goddess I'm  looking up to her  this is great  ice tea  you gotta flip  you gotta make a  situation where  you're the attractive  one you're the one  she's going after  you're the piece of  meat  act like wherever  you are that's  the place to be  let me ask you a  question because it  seems to me like  you've got this  whole thing down  is charisma something  that you'd say  because a lot of  people would feel  that it's completely  natural and yet  there's the other  camp that would  say yeah it's  natural I mean  are you kind of  thinking that it's  natural or are you  going to go like 
[02:10:00]  no no no it's  probably only slightly  natural well the  thing is everybody  is born that's not  that's not what I'm  saying yeah yeah  what I'm saying is  Andrew please is  there a connection  between right a  personality and  charisma or is it  something that you  find uh to use your  word congruent uh as  time goes on oh I  think it's it's a  connection that you  build up the more  not no no no no  not a connection  no no no listen  listen closely it's  very important very  important is there a  connection between the  having a charisma and 
[02:10:30]  and developing some of  these skills uh from the  very get-go now I heard  you the third time the  answer is an emphatic  yes all right well no  please don't just give  me you have to uh you  have to elaborate you  need more than a yes  there Andrew you're the  author you have to  understand that in a  situation like this uh  like I was saying  everybody is technically  born charismatic no no  no no I'm not talking  about people who are  born charismatic I'm  talking about you're  completely missing the  question here are people  uh uh uh uh uh uh  could they could they 
[02:11:00]  become that way if say  it's not like a natural  inclination uh to force  something like that  oh no go ahead you talk  I'm sorry I wasn't done  with his question Andrew  that's cool yeah  absolutely anybody  all right now go ahead  it's all about you I  mean who am I just  asking some questions I  know I'm trying to get to  the bottom of this  no no no but I'm just  trying to I want to be  hostile  no no I hear you no  yeah no no apparently  you don't hear me because  you keep answering the  wrong question it was a  two-part question yes  what I'm saying is is  there a way to come from  like not that background  and then all of a sudden  to turn it into something  like that yes go ahead 
[02:11:30]  now right just feel free  to jump in whenever you  want to I don't need to  finish go ahead go  answer go ahead so  apparently this is a big  question for you to  answer go ahead go well  yeah you can come back  from it all you have to do  come back from what from  what from being nothing  from being uncharismatic  from being uncomfortable  around people from feeling  like you don't have to  control on a date or a  conversation no no but I'm  talking about the humor  angle like when you're  talking about the smooth  moves we're completely on  different pages here okay so  what do you mean in terms of  the humor that's exactly it  like oh you should it be 
[02:12:00]  something that you start  with as a natural charisma or  or will the humor kind of  come naturally to a person  who doesn't normally have  that I mean it's not  second the second thing you  just said humor  no no no no no hold on  god are you frustrating  will you listen for one  I'm trying  I'm trying  you're a good writer but  you're not a good listener  yeah it's all about you  it should just be the  Andrew show people call in  and try to ask a question  all right and you just  talk about whatever you  want to go ahead it's all  about you who was I to ask  a question maybe we should  just have you come in and  we go home and you talk  sorry about that fellow 
[02:12:30]  no no that's all right it's  about you and we don't know  what we're doing listen  closely listen closely  now what I'm what I'm  saying is here on page  listen closely here's the  the important question  go ahead Jimmy now would  you say that with the  uh uh uh uh humor angle  is it more important to  start with that or should  you more bring that home  without having done  something a similar like  you know like when you  first started talking  and with the charisma  thing though because  that's the point Jimmy  was really getting at the 
[02:13:00]  charisma and with the  humor right is that an  angle that is better suited  for uh earlier in the  process right  later midway but without  having had that normally  right as a part of it  yeah I got you  yeah you definitely  start with the humor  no no no but that's  not what I'm saying  what I'm saying is  should you start that  way yeah absolutely  right okay but that's  not start with what  the humor  no no that wasn't even  no no you don't start  with the humor  Jesus Christ  you never start with  the humor  well where can people  get your book  uh create 
[02:13:30]  I love the don't get  the question  bitch  I love it  no no no  why don't you go ahead  and talk  um  oh god  uh  just this we'll do  that tomorrow  we're running out of  show we got a pair of  tickets to the virus tour  at the PNC Bank Art  Center on Saturday  August 25th courtesy of  Blades of Glory on DVD  and stores everywhere  Tuesday August 28th
