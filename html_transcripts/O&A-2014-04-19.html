<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a series of commercials for various services, including tax relief, real estate, lawn care, phone systems, trucking, teeth whitening, and car buying.  The hosts then launched into a discussion of Coachella's lineup, expressing their disdain for the featured artists. This segued into a discussion of Tom Petty's "You're Jammin' Me," specifically questioning the inclusion of Joe Piscopo and Eddie Murphy in the lyrics.  Listener calls followed, detailing experiences with sleep paralysis, including claims of out-of-body experiences, sparking further anecdotes and speculation from the hosts.

Next, the show moved on to a viral video of a disastrous Wheel of Fortune contestant, generating much laughter and mockery.  This was followed by a news report showing a college hockey riot in Minnesota, featuring intoxicated students harassing a news reporter.  More listener calls ensued, discussing this incident. A caller then shared a story about their young daughter and niece claiming communication with their deceased grandmother, prompting a discussion about children's experiences with the deceased and the phenomenon of mediums like the Long Island Medium.  The broadcast concluded with the somber announcement of the death of Otto Peterson, a long-time friend and guest of the show. The hosts and callers shared heartfelt remembrances of his comedic talents and contributions, interspersing their grief with the show's characteristic crude humor.  Hollywood Joe DeRosa was a guest during this segment.  Otto Peterson's death was discussed extensively, with callers sharing anecdotes about his famously filthy comedy and his appearances on the show, including clips from *The Late Show with David Letterman* and a Moujan hair removal commercial.  The hosts and callers also discussed his struggles with substance abuse and his career frustrations.  Clips of Otto's act were played.

A post-show broadcast with Sam Roberts further explored Otto Peterson's death.  Additional listener calls shared personal anecdotes, and clips showcased Otto's extremely filthy one-liner style.  One caller recounted a humorous story about Otto being physically assaulted by a woman after an off-color comment. His appearances on the show, live performances, involvement in the "Traveling Virus Tour," and appearance on Letterman were discussed.  A clip of Otto discussing Jeff Dunham was also played.  Speculation about the cause of death ensued, but the hosts stated they lacked definitive information.  Following this, Sam Roberts engaged in a lengthy conversation with a Reddit co-founder about the site's history, the Armenian genocide, and its impact.  The post-show concluded with more commercials.

A later segment focused on hacking, its evolving connotations, and the internet's influence on society and politics.  The hosts discussed a website hack revealing user data, debated the ethics of "white hat" versus "black hat" hacking, and touched upon WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden.  The conversation expanded to political and financial corruption, referencing Arlen Specter and the "Wolf of Wall Street," along with the legalization of marijuana. The role of the internet in disseminating information and memes (like Rickrolling) was discussed, alongside Obama's "you didn't build that" quote and the changing perceptions of authority among millennials.  Finally, the show concluded with anecdotes from the comedy world, including advice (and mis-advice) from club owners Jamie Masada and Mitzi Shore, and reflections on the challenges of stand-up comedy.  This segment contained no studio guests.  Throughout the entire broadcast, frequent use of offensive language and discussions of potentially sensitive topics were prevalent.

[00:15:00]  nick in syracuse nick what  hey hey what's up guys um hey what's up nick what what you got yep hey  jimmy was talking about the sleep paralysis yeah  this guy on um art bell show for like whatever however long he was on serious this one guy  dr elbert taylor came on and talked about how like that happened to him all the time and he was 
[00:15:30]  able to apparently he could be full of shit but he said that he used that state to like  have out-of-body experiences and shit and he like went out and didn't experiment like he went to one  place and experiment looked like a gum yeah exactly like that but um yeah i don't know apparently like  he said it's possible and shit like you could uh he ended up he was afraid of it at first then he  like used it to do all kinds of crazy shit with it go to different dimensions and all that so 
[00:16:00]  i was wondering if jimmy ever did that or if he ever uh no no and neither did he you know it's just  i you feel like you can rise out of your body though i understand why someone would say it feels like  that but it's uh no you don't have out of body i swear to you when i was uh younger living with my  parents early teens maybe i swear i have this this that i felt like i left my body oh and walked  into the bathroom were you comfortably numb is that it there is no pain no no i but i have a memory 
[00:16:30]  that i've i feel like that absolutely happened huh but i don't know how to explain it was i just  dreaming could have been a dream i felt like i went to the bathroom but not with my body  how do you explain that did you piss yourself you're just dreaming yeah maybe you're just dreaming  especially when you're a kid you don't even get the fucking what the dream is so you think it's  real i don't know sure sure you do you was just dreaming i remember that gregorio you thought i went to 
[00:17:00]  the bathroom i was like no you're just not used to that pressure in your hiding that was my finger  he doesn't even try to be subtle i know no i was helping him i was taking his temperature oh okay  he had a fever as long as you're helping your head was warm so i wet my finger and i put it in your  bottom i said let me see how warm you are there gregorio oh your little feet was kicking in your pjs 
[00:17:30]  like he was swimming it's horrible this isn't fun anymore yeah quick quick question when you took  that out of body shit like were you able to smell it like you guys were talking about smelling the  dream i don't even remember if i took a leak or any of that stuff i just have this memory from when  i was a child that i've i've kept with me for many many years where i i truly felt like i left my body  and and for whatever reason walked into the the bathroom and i'm sure it was probably you know just 
[00:18:00]  a dream or whatever but to my no way to know i mean it could be true though who knows  and i always thought to myself over the years wow i really would like to do that again it was cool  i remember one dream that i had when i was fucking like five years old and it was when casper the  friendly ghost uh took a shit he i was hanging out with casper the friendly ghost and he took a  shit on the sidewalk and i was like casper went to the bathroom and you remember this from being 
[00:18:30]  i remember it but it was like it's it is definitely the first dream i ever remember having and i  remembered it for so long because i thought it was the funniest thing as i got older i kind of  remembered it and i was like that with you all these years casper taking a shit casper the friendly  ghost but did casper have a bunch of friends that looked like him and they were on horseback 
[00:19:00]  let's go to uh mark on long island thank you for that other call there marky  yeah what's going on hey man i'm in the clinic yeah in college i uh used to take adderall and uh that  shit would cause a lot of sleep paralysis and i would take it to to study and i would see myself  from across the room and i would take naps in the study hall it was weird yeah you're probably just  thinking you saw yourself yeah all right now dreams will weird you out right it is yeah exactly i think 
[00:19:30]  a lot of people when they have these spiritual awakenings and um after uh death experiences but  then they come back i think that's all some kind of a dream state thing you know once you start  crossing wires in your head you could you know it can make you believe anything and you could see  things hear things smell things you're in certain places where you're not you confuse your memory of  things with the actual reality of where you are now it could fucking short circuit all kinds of 
[00:20:00]  shit up there when uh when you got stress going on just made up of a lot of goo and yeah some electric  currents we're a goopy machine it's a goo machine instead of a metal and wires and everything it's  all goopy stuff but it works the same way uh bishop in chicago bishop good morning john i've had i've  had the sleep paralysis probably five or six times in my life it's the weirdest thing you just wake up  you cannot move your eyes you can't control your breathing you can't scream you can't move 
[00:20:30]  right and then what happens to me is i just basically get in such a panic i pass back out  and then wake up covered in sweat and then pass out yeah i it's just like such a panic feeling then  it just all goes black and then you wake back up and every time it's happened i've been just covered  in sweat and it's not a fun thing wow that is really strange we're getting no answers to any of  this stuff by the way where's our experts there's a lot of theories as far as dreams go i understand 
[00:21:00]  that when i was when i was a kid it was probably just a dream but i remember it being that i really  truly felt i left my body and walked into the bathroom i fucked up so just explain that and you  can't just say well it's a dream but why is it is it to is it a dream to the point where you really  believe you actually did that yeah that's what i'm trying to figure out i've i never forgot that one  it's one of the only things i really truly remember as far as uh dreams and things like 
[00:21:30]  that go i had a fever as a kid and i remember being a little delirious and uh thinking that  i was doing certain things you know walking around when i wasn't did your hands swell up like two  balloons yes you want to learn how to control your dreams song uh sure dave in pennsylvania dave  hi uh new fan guys yeah local local college here it was in the newspaper 
[00:22:00]  a year or two ago they developed these special glasses penn state  they developed these glasses with like a light in them and they claim that like when you're in  red sleep like if you were dreaming you were a field like the sky would like blink like it would be that  light and they said with with training you could participate in your dreams yeah could be all  bullshit but no i think you can because there are certain times you get right you realize you're 
[00:22:30]  dreaming and then you can do things no but you're right at the brink of waking up which is the bad part  and i think that's the only reason you can control them is because you're so close to waking up because  every time i do get into a point where i'm controlling a dreamer i know i'm dreaming so i start  doing other things like flying around or something like that then i wake up you just gotta stay cool  stay cool i always you're right i'm like whoa i'm so excited right girl's naked over here the next  thing you know it's like butterflies in a fucking field somewhere oh it's terrible i panic so what 
[00:23:00]  do you do you just stay cool you're like okay i'm dreaming oh i'm dreaming that girl over there  is naked now what do i do what do i do what do i do walking over there and she turns into a dog  yeah you gotta stay cool right yeah stay tiptoe over to her i think so you edge your way over real  slowly hello hello baby i don't know yeah let's move on because these phone calls are all the same

[00:40:00]  even if he was from even if he was from wherever the other guy said yeah  of course ethiopia oh look at this he's just a fucking idiot evolution oh no bob saget it says  evolution of bob saget family man to filthy comedian what do you call yourself the aristocrats  after a family has uh done something you don't want to do 
[00:40:30]  you've been known for years and but it's not right family man to filthy comedian he was filthy  comedian that went into right that family man and that family uh man thing in the sitcoms  making him do the aristocrats joke again no it's together let's let them on here in theaters i  didn't know it's going to be in theaters i had a daughter going to get my oldest daughter who is  in this book and she was she's been in my book signings and she's beautiful um and she said i'm  going into the theater now dad to watch the aristocrats i remember it was a nightmare said no don't don't

[00:41:30]  tv show right he's a dirty guy people now know that i know mainstream media i guess they don't let's say  hi to dave in minnesota he wants to add a little more to that uh that video we just played here of  the tv reporter getting just harassed dave yeah hey yeah you gotta look like halfway through the video  you'll see one guy walking past the reporter talking with him and then there's a line of  cops that just come out of nowhere and he spots them and he's like a deer and head bites and he just 
[00:42:00]  bolts at the other direction oh really we did see when the cops showed up yeah yeah you weren't really  fucking with him as much oh it's great i love those i i i love all of those yeah those videos are great  when the reporters lose it that riot was just a bunch of drunk kids but the news made it seem like it was  some crazy dangerous life-threatening situation mike in minneapolis it seemed like it was all right  a lot of those cities they the cops have like all the riot gear and all the fun stuff but they never  get to use it they want to really break it in a little bit so if there's like a gathering of people 
[00:42:30]  uh committing uh shenanigans right you got to put on the helmet and get your fucking clubs out in  the shields and start racking a few heads breaking in your new glove right right breaking in the new  glove for spring and uh it gives you a few fun stories to tell in the locker room sure let's go  to sandra in cincinnati hi um whose birthday is it today  what oh boy cincinnati big star coming out of cincinnati march shot march shots birthday nope

[00:43:30]  whatever it's probably just she's repeating what we told her well about a week later we had dinner with  my other family and my niece who's about the same age as my daughter she was like yeah i talked to  grandma on the phone the other day and she said that she wasn't sick anymore and that she loved us  and i was just like holy shit well grandma got a new repertoire exactly the kids all the same  shit that was on board right we've done them for that's a twilight zone i remember that one 
[00:44:00]  that was uh the one with um it was uh the kid uh billy moomy there from uh from lost in space  his grandma his grandmother died and uh and he kept getting phone calls from her and the grandmother  was trying to get him to kill himself what so he would be with the grandmother sure and the father  and mother are like what the fuck knock it off so then the kid he does it he jumps into the fountain  out back and drowns himself and he's laying on the ground and they're like oh we can't get you know 
[00:44:30]  the emt guys are like oh we can't get him back to life and then the father gets on the phone the  little toy phone it starts going mom please please don't take our boy he has such a long life and then  the kid comes back to life because the father was like pleading with his mother to not  fucking uh take the kid the show was brilliant that show is great it holds up too it absolutely  you can still watch those and it's uh just as a chilling or right or fucking captivating to watch 
[00:45:00]  i love it thank you sandra thank you have a good one uh we got a therapist he's going to explain why  uh children can speak to dead relatives his name is gorilla bob and he's calling from the jersey  turnpike uh gorilla bob oh yeah hello boys i can uh i know why uh children can see or babies really  can see yeah all of those dead relatives oh yes yes eagerly awaiting yes i'm not explaining it to you 
[00:45:30]  oh what why would you that's obi's new bit i'm the new bit guy remember what bet said goodbye boys  what the fuck that was like a bad edit of six phone calls yes but i don't understand i don't either  new bit guy he's not going to tell us is he the guy that calls up and says i know this but then  doesn't tell us is that his character i think i said that one time yeah that's just oh maybe a 
[00:46:00]  little maybe he ran with it i guess all right jim on long island jim right here oh what's up boys  hey buddy hey there oh yeah we're here waiting yeah listen so uh the other day my uh two-year-old  nephew he's uh in the crib and all of a sudden i hear him going cattle tail castor earl  yeah i called him on the phone oh i make ghost noises 
[00:46:30]  i saw on twitter over the weekend that the long island medium was uh trending really so i kind  of clicked on the trend to see what that was all about and there's all these mostly women i gotta  be honest with you were completely losing their shit over watching the long island medium why what  was she doing talking to dead people which has been disproven by well everybody but they they 
[00:47:00]  love suing people that say just that for whatever reason well let's say what who told us to be  careful with that pen okay but you just can't call them liars you can't say liar or fraud but you could  say uh you know i i don't believe that bullshit yeah but who's still buying into that and you could say  i'm sure a few of my family members i should show people who are very hopeful i've never seen people that  have uh definitively proven that they talk to dead people and i've seen a lot of people who have  definitively definitively disproven like pen is a brilliant is brilliant when it comes to uh 
[00:47:30]  to that right and how they do it but um it's it's amazing but i mean like just how she gets vague  information and people are still is vague are still holding out hope it's like yeah why does she have vague  signals coming from the beyond you know what the greatest thing for these people has been the  fucking internet if you have an appointment if someone calls you with an appointment to  fucking have a reading done about your dead relative and you just google their name or go 
[00:48:00]  deeper fuck google it's a it's a business expense at that point you go into their records find up their  ancestry with their death records yeah exactly ancestry you know shit like that you could get so much  information anyone could seem like an amazing psychic yeah you would absolutely blow someone's  mind yep but to still believe and when she's like i'm thinking of the way he's kind of highway i think  he's trying to say uh it starts with an ass and everyone just stares so she knows okay sign up uh well no 
[00:48:30]  no no no that's uh well wait wait it's a a a p and then she sees someone like jump up a little bit  ah yeah and people still buy into that shit john edwards shit went on his tv show he used to make  people fill out stuff right like they didn't show that part go to twitter and and put in long island  medium as i think that was the hashtag you got to read some of these tweets yeah people are they'd lose 
[00:49:00]  their minds over yeah they're dopes they deserve what they get they deserve what they get they're  dopes right they're fucking dopes and they deserve what they get there was only one good medium her name  was uh reya yes and i remember telling her once well done medium reya  we heard you i think she spelled that long by the way  we heard you loud and clear yeah it's really bad it's your face though it's from you're hurting 
[00:49:30]  today you're hurting i like to pick up a nice raw steak with both hands and slap your face as hard  as i can smack me across my sunburned face with a nice raw steak oh yeah if you're tuning in it's  face is like beet red it's supposed to calm down a little bit it's supposed to be a couple hours  like 74 today and sunny so i'm going to be out by the pool again nice but i'm going to put a little  lotion on this time or something that resembles yeah this is something that resembles don't get burned 
[00:50:00]  lotion did you see my picture that i tweeted of mr brady no one of the episodes no when did you  tweet it apparently uh yesterday i saw apparently mr brady in one episode was wearing an apron right  and he was cooking something and then jan was doing her spastic uh tap dancing right and she  knocked into what he was cooking which was some batter stuff and it hit the floor and sprayed up on  him so he's standing there in an apron looking down with this white creamy stuff all over his shirt 
[00:50:30]  and your tweet was just nice i just put i put it and i said foreshadowing or something  shadowing right question mark because he had come on him sam sam read some of these start with that  plain jane one i see uh in the red right there start with that one if i could meet anyone it would be  teresa caputo i freaking love her she is amazing hashtag long island medium i honestly think she changes  lives uh this person well she might i mean in all fairness you might change people's lives but it's all 
[00:51:00]  in my opinion complete bullshit she's not talking to any dead people oh this person says i get some  people think hashtag long island medium is fake regardless the things she does for people is  amazing they need what she gives them uh this person says hashtag long island medium i love you teresa  i'm your number one fan i wish you can tell my grandma i wish you can tell my grandma that i love 
[00:51:30]  her and miss her so much thanks god bless you you just did she's got twitter  if it's heaven it's got to have everything right of course so grandma's got twitter don't worry about  it this episode of hashtag long island medium is hitting too close to home first time i ever cried  this way watching something on tv oh god that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying  to believe in what what she's putting forward how does she sleep at night you think there's just 
[00:52:00]  dope people are dope she probably just says well you know i know it's entertainment or maybe she  says i'm helping people because she probably spins in her head like well i know that yeah i don't  actually have these powers yeah but in the end i think i'm helping them get over this it amazes me  that people don't know that these powers don't exist it's amazing to me that there are people that  believe uh people are stupid when you can tell when you watch videos that people post check this

[00:54:00]  yeah i just find it hard to believe that anybody can communicate i but i wish all that stuff was  believable to me i wish i could believe it but it's such a nice reassuring thing that would absolutely  prove that there's life after death that would be an amazing thing for everybody uh let's go to tom  from the float place tom where's your float place long island yes sir long island it's in uh  farmville it's opened up in november man i'm supposed to go right yeah i'll send you uh i'll

[01:03:30]  time you've known him forever you're fucking you comics jesus christ yeah i'm fucking believable  i don't know if it was tied into what had happened where he was in the hospital for a while yeah he was  in the hospital last year was it for a while almost uh was it almost a year ago or something  some sort yeah yeah hmm so i guess his girlfriend was calling people and um this was just the first 
[01:04:00]  i heard of it it's just heartbreaking look no shit wow me  that's just out of nowhere yeah that shit just blindsides you  he was a funny fucking guy man i mean we always say that about people when they  die off court but auto was a funny fucking guy yeah i don't think no one made me laugh harder than  him no one as a guy and funny so inappropriately funny i love it god yeah oh boy that's fucking that

[01:05:00]  it's like what do you say you don't even know what to say no it's just a bummer it seemed like he was  doing you know pretty good too yeah got over that illness which was extremely scary for him and  every you know everybody else he was in the hospital a while wasn't it he was in canada for what was it  for uh the comedy festival oh i don't even know what he was doing yeah then you fast forward he came in  here looking great all rested and tan and feeling much better yeah gee we would just i mean you always 
[01:05:30]  say that when you're done we were texting the other day back and forth doing uh bob levy and  clockwork orange it was the last thing we were talking about was bobby it was fun too oh shit i  realized when i was texting him too like i'm such a perv with my phone and i'm such a piece of garbage  but i'm like it's so nice to be just texting a friend just having some laughs like not funny stuff 
[01:06:00]  yeah like it made i had an odd revelation while i was doing that like it's so nice to be texting  healthy and just having some fun together right not just looking for pussy or yeah like trolling it  made me feel really normal and healthy just yelling at somebody or something yeah just having some  laughs did some uh amazing stuff for this radio show did our comedy festival and yeah yeah i knew him  way before then though when he was uh performing at fast eddies in huntington oh yeah he was in he 
[01:06:30]  would just he would just slay he's been a name to go see for for years the whole town knew about him  because he would come to fast eddies and just kill it yeah he was just amazing  never really got his due that's no he never did nope no he didn't  uh bob levy bobby yeah i just got the call just now and uh i'm just shocked man i mean we were 
[01:07:00]  friends for like 20 some years and you know he finally got his life together and for this to happen  you know we were just talking last week about stories from what we used to do when we were crazy  and he we're like i can't believe we're still alive and you know i don't know what happened  you know right it's just like i it just blows me away that just one after another i mean  we're going down you know it's like  fucking wrestlers have shit like a comedian what the fuck you're right just telling jokes you know 
[01:07:30]  and it's just like this really hit me man and we were going to hang out we you know in a week or  two we were going to florida for a gig and just he goes let's stay a few days and hang out and have  a good time and get some sun and i was like yeah man that sounds great and it's just like  fucking unbelievable because uh you know he is he was a legend in his business and always will be known 
[01:08:00]  as that and that's got to be kept up you know what i mean yeah he may have been more underground  than most people but they're a lot of most of the people that are underground are better than you  see on tv so right when you pop up on other comics favorite comic lists you know like he was  he was always on a lot of people's list when you talk to comics about who was  fucking hilariously funny and i don't know right you know with bob how was he doing lately i mean he was 
[01:08:30]  on our show i don't know not that long ago and he looked great yeah yeah yeah like he would call  he called me up and he goes right to have a couple beers right you know and i was like you know you  don't need to drink i mean but you know because i just wanted to sit in the yard you know and like  he was basically sober he was off the coke you know i mean and uh i i just hope it's not you know 
[01:09:00]  people fall back you know i haven't fall back and fell back in you know almost four years now but you  know it could shock your body and that shit but i just i just you know what i mean i just hope he went  peaceful because i mean like working with him like it was the greatest thing because we used to go to  tips to work right right and that was a well-known comedy club a lot of big stars came out of there  david breiner you know what i mean uh dice and many more and we played there one weekend and he 
[01:09:30]  looked at me and he goes we made it you know what i mean right because we in comedy people most fans  think you make it when you got it on tv or something like that when you're most of you on tv they couldn't  follow me with their fucking dick in their hands okay so they ain't fucking nothing compared to us  and uh it it's just fucking it's just so shocking when i got the call like out of it just like you 
[01:10:00]  know when you just talk to somebody and you're just talking about the future and saying you know let's  team up together we'll get roger to get us some dirty shows you know yeah yeah he seems so fucking  happy you know what i mean because he loves working we always had fun working you know i have such  great i'm writing a book now and we were going over stories that we did together when we were a party  and when like we after a show we got a like a gram of coke and he made me bring george home first 
[01:10:30]  before we did it because he couldn't sit in the trunk and that was like years ago and but he's clean  you see what i mean when you fucking get your shit cleaned up you can talk about it and laugh at  shit right and this is this is fucking shocking you know what i mean for someone that i've known since  fucking i started this fucking thing and looked up to and was the nicest guy yet if anybody says a 
[01:11:00]  bad word about otto you don't fucking know him or you're a fucking asshole off stage that guy he might  have been the filthiest motherfucker and i was just bragging to him about him to someone the other  day i go he is the filthiest motherfucker out there but he is hilarious and you can watch him over and  over yeah yeah and it and it's just it's it's it's really fucking shocking that fucking this shit is going 
[01:11:30]  on man i don't understand it man i mean i'm like fucking lost right now because i just got the phone  call and yeah this shit's always fucked up just don't know what to do or say just walk around in a haze  yeah it's like you don't know what to say you don't know like what the  fuck do you say to his girlfriend you know what i mean yeah you know i mean the way i look at it 
[01:12:00]  you got to take care of her do a show you know what i mean fucking raise some money you know you  got to do something in his name you know yeah he he was a fucking legend i don't give a fuck if you  know what i mean all these douchebags can get on fucking tv or whatever the fuck with this shit material  because they got a pretty look or something like that but let me tell you something the real  fucking legends are the ones that fucking go out there and bust their balls every night and 
[01:12:30]  fucking kill in front of people and there should be something of fun made up for him where his name  would carry on because i mean he did mean a lot to a lot of fucking people and of course you guys i  mean he fucking loves you guys you know he's always talked about you guys you know right because you  guys are fucking real you know he was fucking hilarious on the on the show too yeah yeah he  came to you guys because you guys are fucking real he's a real fucking person he's not into the 
[01:13:00]  bullshit hollywood i got it that's why he came to you i gotta tell you i gotta tell you that george  thing was creepy though at times i remember oh yeah i remember at any w uh he comes in in the early  days when we didn't know him that well and he's just killing it for us and then like in between  breaks he always loved reading the newspaper auto loved getting knowledge and yeah yeah he's reading  the newspapers while we're in break and i look over and then i kind of like get ants attention i go you 
[01:13:30]  gotta look at this what is he doing and he's reading the newspaper and george is reading along  with auto like he's moving george's head and stuff and i'm moving his eyes like back and forth and i  never forgot that because i'm thinking oh my god he's not doing this for anyone he doesn't even realize  we're looking at him right now and i'm like what is that i'm like what is that about  well that's what it is it becomes like you know it's part of you right you know what i mean like  to him and like when he was done with his set like no one can tell you he would wrap his doll up his 
[01:14:00]  head up like you know like an iranian or something like that so it was comfortable it had like the head  gear on it but it always had to go home before we went out after a show man and and he always had  like you know rodney loved him okay and ron and he always had he goes listen listen to this message  we always do every time we went back we listened to it he's like hey kid i'm telling you you know  what i mean let's go you got it you know you're the man you know you make a laugh you know but you 
[01:14:30]  know i think he was somewhat a little bit afraid of success yeah yeah and but the whole thing was is  that you never you can never sit down with a guy and just like a sweetheart you know what i mean right  like you know there's scumbags in this business you know what i mean but you know i mean nobody could 
[01:15:00]  say that about him i mean he was a true fucking person and you know i it's just you wake up and  you know just fucking you know i'm listening to you guys i finally got my schedule set up and  fucking i got a call and i'm and i'm like this has got to be a fucking joke because we were just talking  last week we're supposed to go to florida next friday or saturday right yeah i'm like  fuck we were gonna hang out and that shit and i'm just like i don't you know what i mean it makes 
[01:15:30]  you think about everything you know it's just fucking heartbreaking you never know guy who never  got is doing the business and uh you know he's another funny guy who the business just did not  give what he deserved to right he was another funny guy with all these fucking mediocre  motherfuckers because the critics like him and because they they uh i think they carry the right 
[01:16:00]  narrative or ideology and a brilliantly funny guy like him and he auto was punch you in the stomach  funny nobody made people laugh when he killed it was absolutely unfollowable yeah and he's one of those  guys that all the comedians would walk in to watch and i remember somebody at a roast it was years  ago this is probably i'm 1992 or 93 was talking about somebody and they said uh they mentioned um  uh what did what did he say about otto he said something about you'll notice that the comedians 
[01:16:30]  in the room he was a roast that the public was at and he said you'll know who the comedians in the  room are because they're the ones in the room uh who are not laughing until otto is on and then  they're going to be the only ones who are i always remember that is such a great description of mixing  auto with comics and the public right and he was just that that's what he always said he always said  how come these pieces of shit are on tv and we can't get a fucking special you know what i mean he 
[01:17:00]  he goes he goes it's it's because you know what i mean like these mtv guys got 15 fucking minutes  they're fucking selling alcohol are you fucking kidding me comedy is a fucking like you know like  me jimmy you know auto quarantine you know everybody that you know that's fucking anybody that's  fucking powerful and knows comedy it's just just such a shitty fucking business because they put out 
[01:17:30]  shit on tv yet you know what i mean so people don't go as the clubs they're like if this is  what's in clubs no that's not within clubs right come and see real comedy man it's not some 18 year  old girl that has 15 minutes it's just one of those things thank you brother i'll talk to you soon  i'll see you i'm sure i'll see you before the the thing that's yeah thanks man help out the family 
[01:18:00]  wait yeah all right bobby thank you guys bob lee it's just very close without george jimmy just  told us that auto uh died in his sleep yeah i got the uh call from jim in um during the thing right  i just it's really weird to not be able to say that you know i just couldn't say it right it was  you know whatever we all act weird when we hear that and then you take a couple minutes but it's just  terrible do you remember the first time you met him or saw him yep it was in uh the varsity pub 
[01:18:30]  and it was before i did comedy i was just starting me and my buddy would go to watch  shows that's where i first saw florentine um guys like quentin haggs and that guy jeff zebrowski  who i did get an update on by the way he retired and won some kind of lotteries oh really yeah he's  doing good but uh auto was one of the guys that patrick gainer who was the guy who really i would  not be doing comedy if it wasn't patrick gainer told me who was patrick gainer i don't even he was  a local booker oh and uh he died years ago and uh the varsity pub was the first place i ever went on 
[01:19:00]  so i would go and watch the shows on the weekends i would never heckle the comics sometimes patrick  would let me like introduce the show just to get me on stage before i ever performed and i that's where  i saw auto for the first time and i it was a it was it was like seeing zeppelin for you know yeah jesus  yeah seeing him for the first time was was a shock right like uh and i think i saw him at um  at uh the place fast eddies that was the first place i saw him they taped them and then that was 
[01:19:30]  one of those tapes you gotta remember way before the internet i'm talking like my bab days so what 92  to 95 ish somewhere in there and uh they they taped them a couple times that tape man yeah by the time you  you got a copy you almost couldn't you know hear it anymore but that's he was one of those guys where  his stuff was just passed around and traded yeah if he was going to be around locally everyone knew it 
[01:20:00]  right and you had to go see him because he was like the you know you were going to see  shit you weren't going to see anywhere else but you had to go pick him up  always all you guys have stories about that yeah yeah you'd have to pick him up from he lived off  jewel avenue in queens at one point and i lived in north brunswick and i remember i would pick him  up to go to you'd have to go yeah wow wow that's a hell of a drive right i remember what's his name  oh great white gorilla he used to have to pick him up oh yeah jeff jeff norris i remember he stepped in 
[01:20:30]  dog shit and brought in my car and i wanted to fucking strangle it so i just got the car and  florentine was with me he's like auto you tracked the whole log in the car he brought a  fucking it was like a log of horse shit like you dope it wasn't just a little no  giant you brought the whole log yeah you brought the whole login is florentine uh up for talking  or not really i don't i don't want to force anyone on the show but um maybe get word out if he wants  to call on that'd be great um i also remembered any w he he was this funny that we we like tolerated 
[01:21:00]  some of this stuff like he would kill for a minute or two and then feel like it wasn't going well and  and and then he would just leave and me and anthony would sit and certainly jimmy too would salt us  over the years and and all of a sudden like what where'd he go yeah he would just run out  he got that under control uh years later but yeah yeah you remember those days yep  i like it he thought he thought he sucked he's gone like he he was killing  yeah oh this just sucks that was no it's just like enough of this i hate it i mean you just gotta 
[01:21:30]  kind of you know get through it what do you do there's no fucking nothing you can do  there's nothing you do you just gotta feel like now for you know everybody makes it about how come  out i wasn't able to become more of a star that's that's a pretty good question i don't know he was 
[01:22:00]  there was one like fucking patrice he shouldn't he wouldn't play the game he wouldn't uh i think i  think it's one part of his career it was probably his demons yeah and uh uh substance abuse that uh kept  him from uh really achieving but then you know he's not going to compromise and not say  pope wrote cunt sir he never had the proper management i don't think he ever had the proper  people rick messina really loved him who was tim allens all those guys loved otto right and they 
[01:22:30]  really did and uh he was in comedy's dirtiest dozen with uh chris rock and bill hicks and a bunch of  those guys um you know and i think that they loved him but it's like what do you do yeah with a dirty  ventriloquist i'm guessing that's what the business which is so uncreative and right pathetic and every  time they come out with those fucking funniest people lists i want to just fucking strangle  the dummy who wrote it because there's usually 10 people like really or 15 people i think really  deserve to be on it and then and the other 35 that are just like oh you fucking really benicio del 
[01:23:00]  toro is he a hoot it's just the weirdest you know and it's like a guy like otto will never make  a list like that yeah never and he was funnier than any of them yeah he was funnier than any of them  jeez oh geez yeah boy did i work with him having some fucking awful shows too well when they didn't  like him it was ugly oh yeah yeah there was no ambiguity they hated him boy it was full steam ahead 
[01:23:30]  right but he had no problem with that no he didn't like it but i mean he would he knew how to deal with  it i mean he would just he couldn't change gears he was he was who he was yeah you know and so he  would just kind of fucking plow ahead and make it worse for him yeah he oh he could rip into people  oh man yeah wow he says some great stuff yeah we got any um i don't know when george stuff we could  play today yeah what do we but you guys find a few uh well we're looking through stuff right now but

[01:37:00]  fucked up uh uh viewpoint just completely politically incorrect which i loved right yeah  yeah we got um oh wow hollywood joe's checking in nice joe de rosa hi buddy how are you guys yeah  you know it takes for someone to die for you for you to call us oh shit joe come on come on man 
[01:37:30]  i poke i poke as i love brother you know that i'm just fucking with you yeah i i woke up i'm usually  not awake this early but uh i i couldn't sleep and i looked on twitter and i saw weavey's tweets  about otto and george i can't fucking believe it man i'm like in shock right now yeah uh well that's  what we're all trying to figure out like uh i think we i think jimmy said that he took a nap and that was 
[01:38:00]  it i will i'm sure we'll get more info um later but uh yeah that fucking blows he was so goddamn  funny yeah he he the thing that always blew me away about him was like when the dummy would do like  his inner monologue yeah and like like i remember seeing him at carol orange and like you know he  did a joke that didn't go over that like otto said a joke that didn't go over that well and then  the dummy looked at him and started going what are you nervous you fucking pussy yeah yes it would be 
[01:38:30]  it was the greatest inner monologue reaction ever because he had the puppet and it would be very  funny like if a joke didn't work um and otto would just stammer something george would go sweat you danish  junkie your lips are moving you're supposed to be creating an illusion oh he would just deconstruct  nobody ever deconstructed himself better than fucking otto through his pocket the brilliance of 
[01:39:00]  that you know nobody did that better than him it's so funny i remember i remember we did the nasty show  in uh at just for laughs one year and uh the two things i remember is one he did the he did the  kennedy bit where the puppet gets shot and yeah come out like a kennedy assassination and and during  it he's going he's going they're shooting norton yeah yeah they're shooting put the top up norton  yeah put the top up norton they're shooting at us it's so funny went to a honeymooners pit 
[01:39:30]  right oh shit that's so good man and then and then i remember patrice was on the shows too  it's so fucking sad man jesus christ uh but patrice was on the shows too and we were down the theater  we were in the green room was downstairs under the stage and there's this long cinder block hallway so if  anybody was coming down the hallway from the stage you could hear it it's just echo 
[01:40:00]  i remember patrice was otto was on stage and patrice came walking down and patrice's cackle was like  cascading off the cinder block and he walks in the room and i go what's so funny man and he goes i  don't know just don't give a fuck about even trying to make it look like this  i don't give a fuck oh shit man that's great hey joe de rosa yeah i had a yeah i i forgot about 
[01:40:30]  this we were talking about dreams earlier i had a dream that joe de rosa was in oh really yes and this  was just like two nights ago yeah yeah i i was i was in this bedroom trying to have sex with this  girl on a mattress on the floor and uh you were on a bed in the same room but it was on like a a  frame bed frame so it was a little higher up and uh i was trying to real quiet so you wouldn't hear 
[01:41:00]  but i don't know why you were in the room what was going on the most the most most unrealistic  part of the dream was that i was wearing a condom because you're responsible in your dreams i know  why in a dream when i wear a condom what an asshole i don't know but he dream rapes joe but he's  responsible enough to wear a condom and the condom was weird the condom was making a squeaky rubber 
[01:41:30]  noise that i thought was going to wake joe up right how fucking odd i like that your dream  was reinforcing that you shouldn't wear condoms yes that's the lesson that's the lesson i grabbed  out of the dream fuck the condoms i love that i was in the dream i am too you got up you walked out  of the room i was like hey joe yeah when are you uh are you planning on coming back to new york  anytime soon for some beverages yeah i think i'm going to be in new york all july so oh nice i hope 
[01:42:00]  i hope i get to see you all of you guys and uh and hang out i just cracked uh just cracked the pool  open my friend so uh a party coming up yeah party early yep it's great and we're hearing we're  hearing all the stories from everybody that you're a mover and shaker out there now oh he's hollywood  joe de rosa joe yeah oh yeah taking meetings and hanging out and hobnobbing a little hobnobbing 
[01:42:30]  going on i i i i terribly miss uh the on a show this it's a less it's a less filthy place out here  and i don't i don't know how i feel about that it's probably very artificial feeling and how's the gig  going with uh pete holmes gig's going well awesome i don't know la is weird it's it's been a nice  experience but i just feel like i'm supposed to live in new york that's the best way you know  i've heard a saying it's a nice place to visit but i wouldn't want to live there hey you know 
[01:43:00]  if i had a time i'll tell you can i can i tell you guys my favorite auto story yeah oh you scared me  i thought you were going to say can i plug something oh jesus oh jesus well we usually  we've heard that so many times hey can i yeah of course joe go ahead yeah oh my boss  listen it's real sad can i just say my cd is out right now 
[01:43:30]  this is my favorite auto story he's a he's a caroline uh and he's on stage obviously and um  there's a guy sitting to the left of the stage and it's like this big italian guy the guy's got  to weigh 400 pounds he's just huge but he's wearing this checkered sport coat and uh auto's on stage  and he's doing a bit and the dummy like isn't you know isn't paying attention and in the middle of 
[01:44:00]  the bit the fucking dummy just looks over at the fat guy and he just goes jesus  fucking christ how much what size is that sport coat you fucking zilch  and it would seem like oh my god why is the puppet saying that when auto was in the middle of doing  something like you for somebody who moved his lips when he talked uh working that puppet you were  completely uh fooled into thinking it was a different entity absolutely you know it was a 
[01:44:30]  different fucking person absolutely he was twittering out a lot of old photos recently too like stuff from  like the 70s um really like when he was 15 14 years old if you see his old his twitter timeline um  there's some uh really good pictures yeah yeah oh man i'm gonna look at it if if you guys find  anything out well why don't you text me i'm gonna keep looking yeah we'll let you know joe absolutely 
[01:45:00]  man yeah cool well you guys always uh you guys always you know showcased him and supported him  and that was awesome and it's a bummer that he's it's a real fun yeah i'm so fucking lonely all right  man hopefully uh i'll see you in uh see you in july at some point i'll see you guys in july man i miss all  yeah i'll i see i'll see you soon sounds great joe take it easy man take care guys all right buddy  later what a fucking asshole it's like doing that right when the phone clicks oh what an

[01:46:00]  him where he was on our show and he he was killing but he he said something like oh i suck i suck so i  don't know maybe jimmy could elaborate on this but was was there any you know instability or something i  mean i i don't know did you just ask if there was any instability with auto  yes there was i said i said maybe like five words to the guy when i uh used to see him down at either 
[01:46:30]  the comedy cellar or i saw him in the midwest one day but uh you know i he was he was like my idol  when i when i saw him i was starstruck i i swear to god because he's the funniest guy you know when  when you saw him on um uh the aristocrats you know it was only like a minute and 15 that he was on but  you know he says i bring out my daughter she's a real sexy nine-year-old i kill her i fuck the ball  i mean you have no time to to to register how funny this guy is yeah that day does anyone know what 
[01:47:00]  happened no we don't know yet we truly don't know brother jimmy literally just found out in the middle  of our show he uh ran out of here to take a phone call we we all knew that can't be good oh boy well  listen i'm punching out i love you guys love your brother thank you sir all right man later later man  there he goes a caller ike from washington godspeed oh he's still on

[01:48:00]  gonna be sitting in a box somewhere and maybe never taken out again you think like it's almost human  kind of a person and he's is he dead that is a weird thing it's kind of you know will he just disappear  or because he made him so more mortal that it's like yeah yeah i'm gonna lose george too yeah no one  can else can i can just kind of a weird thing yeah george george goes with auto yeah yeah period 
[01:48:30]  okay that's a strange concept do you think that if auto had if auto had a will i have no idea i  would guarantee that's it well yeah george goes with me you know there's only one thing to say  get over it well yeah i know in time perhaps but there's a time you know you guys make so much fun  of somebody but it's weird when it hits you you almost feel like you guys can't i mean i know  you're gonna joke about it but it's so i mean i remember you guys you're panicking sorry i lost  somebody you're you're panicking why are you panicking because the get over it thing didn't

[01:50:00]  time when pat from winaki went down on a girl in our studio maybe that's what i'm getting here  and it says and otto was there and he said it's like watching tor johnson bobbing for gonorrhea  oh he definitely said that that was actually one of your lines of the day right there  he definitely said that bobbing for gonorrhea holy fuck is that funny yeah lisa sparks lisa sparks

[01:52:00]  just amazing wait wait she twisted out there wait it wasn't all at the same time obviously if they're  calling it seven babies over ten years yeah i guess she didn't want to have a you know those babies  right so she uh had them and then killed them and no one knew until now i guess not  she's a weird looking bitch she's got them crazy how long would the baby survive before  she decided they were evil or whatever the fuck nah nah nah yeah when do when do how crazy do you have 
[01:52:30]  to be like does that does it come up how crazy you are for how long you wait before you realize your  baby's the devil or something and have to get rid of it oh let's see let's say hi to cory and yonkers  cory yes cory hey guys how are you all right all right no i just went to like one of the first times  i ever saw auto was in 1990 or 91 in yonkers at a place called shooting stars oh yeah oh man it was 
[01:53:00]  and it was owned by grandpa al i think at the time oh sure right and no i mean i was only like 18 19  years old and they let you in and just the impact that he had on me he was one of the funniest people  ever saw from then on you would always keep seeing him you know even though his act mostly didn't  change over the past 20 something years let me throw a few new ones in there but that night the  girl i was with was just a very conservative girl and boy did i get an earful coming out that night 
[01:53:30]  and especially she got especially she got up and decided to go to the bathroom during his set  i think i think auto was very particular because he absolutely came up with new stuff all the time but  it was it was it was small there was a line or or two you know what i mean but every time he had  something new it killed every time every fucking yeah oh yeah i must have seen him at least you know  five or six times over all the years and stuff like that and just yeah some of the stuff was the same  and a lot of you know some of the stuff was new but yeah just every time but here's one of those 
[01:54:00]  here's one of those comics too that you could go and see him do some of the same stuff because  you wanted to watch the reaction of the crowd like you knew what was coming so you're like oh  fuck i want to see like how they handle this bag up front is gonna right gonna do when when that line  comes out you know right but one time it always got me i forgot where the heck it was someplace in new  jersey and i guess you get ready to go up and he was sitting behind me with george and i guess he was  warming up but they were basically having a conversation with each other yeah yeah we've 
[01:54:30]  we all saw a little of that over the years i used to bring him on stage sometimes because he hated  when you refer to the puppet as a wooden pal or wooden friend oh just to annoy him  i would go on stage sometimes and say please welcome otto and his wooden buddy george because he  hated being introduced like did did he say something when you left the stage and he took the mic i don't  remember i know that he probably had something under his breath i'm sure yeah yeah he really 
[01:55:00]  loathed it yeah there was one time i was sitting up close i used to be really freaking fat i mean i  looked like 170 pounds over the past year congrats but yeah thank you but he looked at me or the puppet  looked at me just look at me want ring dings just out of nowhere ring dicks he would just do that it  was so funny when he would just stop what he was saying and then george would jump in but you're like  no that's him right he's doing the whole thing yeah genius yeah that guy i'm sorry to hear about you 
[01:55:30]  know oh my god everyone everyone's sad he would grab like george's arm or or the lapel of yeah of  george's little jacket and be like no george and pull him up right take your hands off me  cocksucker take your hands off me stop touching me oh all right crazy all right corey thanks  sweat you danish junkie oh that made me laugh a great fucking jab at himself we got uh mike francesa 
[01:56:00]  he was a huge fan of auto i don't think what's up my condolences man he's fucking one of my favorites  man he's seriously uh one of the comedians one of the comedians that you can tell his like  repeated material somebody can repeat their his material to you like i saw a george and  actually was funny like coming from somebody else and very right yeah yeah you're right  and uh it's so funny that i was listening recently to like the old new days and he wasn't even in the

[02:05:30]  here oh that one was great stupid fredo yeah it's fine so um whatever yeah we'll see you guys  tomorrow we're going to try the johnny ola murder on big a because you know how they  they do the myth busters it doesn't look like you could snap somebody's neck with a wooden hanger that  that that bottom part is pretty frail yeah so i'm going to try i'm going to try and murder big  a on the next johnny ola yeah i'm going to see if that'll work rato's a huge fan of big a 
[02:06:00]  johnny ola was killed with the hangar or he killed somebody he was killed with it it was  it was the bodyguard the old man bodyguarded yeah the guy didn't even have a name yeah yeah  yeah yeah was it rocco lampone or no yeah uh the bodyguard i don't remember but when they  when they told michael your bodyguard is dead he had no reaction just went so where'd you get my  kid for christmas it's like no feeling i'm glad i'm here with with movie aficionados uh here's a  quick before you go five minutes left yeah godfather question yeah original godfather okay how did and 
[02:06:30]  this is not a quiz but how did uh uh uh the father uh don coleon on coleon how did he know after that  meeting when he said i did not know to this day that it was barzini how did he know what happened in  the meeting for him to know that it was barzini the whole time i knew he said it and he figured  it out but what six what instance happened for you to for you to go back and go oh this is what 
[02:07:00]  happened for him that was probably the one question everyone i think it was the way bartini manipulated  the meeting and uh and ran the meeting and made it happen i think the what bartini just he was just  a smart guy and he was too agreeable and he was like uh agreeable and he said a refusal is  not the act of a friend yeah uh if he has them he must share them yeah and i think that was probably  it it was probably that subtle way he led that meeting yeah and got don corleone to concede  his point that he had been fighting with to tell you about and i think that's so it was never a moment 
[02:07:30]  it just was an overall theme yeah a mobster hunch yeah that he knew from you know growing up  watch the godfather 2 and press and press those guys just on a maybe that you're on a maybe right  right you know better better better i didn't know till this day well i kind of know yeah yeah  fuck him anyway yeah he didn't pass the ketchup that one time so what why take a chance yeah  but he said uh he goes uh he could charge for these services he's not we're not communists i think just 
[02:08:00]  the way he led it and and made it happen yeah yeah tip them off yeah good enough that helps me  to watch it again and wanted the drugs done i think it also said that bartini wanted the drugs sold  yeah um because i think some real greaseball he might have thought that bartini would side with  him on no drugs right um but when bartini said that that indicated that he was on the side of the  drugs being sold yeah yeah but didn't that's true but didn't they kill any everybody anyway yeah they 
[02:08:30]  want to kill everybody right michael did and he knew he could make that swear that oath and michael  would do it he knew michael would do it yeah don corleone didn't have even stracci who i have no  idea who the fuck that was when he tells him yeah stracci who's that what me i thought he was all  itch he would stop scratching here you're fucking stracci  i bet stracci's going through the names and you hear stracci you're like who who yeah  the fuck was stracci yeah yeah he probably killed him on a horse's head and something right 
[02:09:00]  it was no definitive thing that happened then no no i don't think there was one moment where they  it wasn't such a blatant thing i think it would have been corny if it was this blatant yeah  yeah haha well where he looked and curled his mustache and his finger like he had his fingers  crossed when he went yeah the pieces yeah when michael found out fredo did it it was kind of a moment of  dun dun like that happened yeah yeah yeah it wasn't like oh shit like it was like right yeah he  fucked up he lied so i thought it was on my maybe a moment there where johnny all took me here 
[02:09:30]  what an asshole fredo is yeah no no we never met i never know  now oh yeah and then like five minutes later oh me and johnny oh yeah johnny comes here all the  time yeah what an idiot fucking dummy beluga whale far-headed fuck and michael  then michael kissed him i was like what are you still getting fresh all right  it's fucking friday i ain't putting up with this shit  the opie and anthony show has gone to a close stay tuned to reflect

[02:20:00]  morning while the show was on uh that our friend auto from auto and george passed away uh within the  last couple days i don't know if uh we know exactly what day it was but we just found out  this morning while the show was on so most of the second half of the show was spent kind of  reflecting on his life and and his specifically his experience with the show uh we'll get into  that in a minute but first why don't we play line of the day sal  here 
[02:20:30]  here  comes  line of the day  line of the day  getting in our way so if we have anything new  no doubt about it  fuck her right in the  pussy absolutely  he felt compelled to get  whoever that guy is just one line of the day so congratulations to that guy who  somebody from minnesota if you haven't seen that video we posted it on our twitter and facebook 
[02:21:00]  pages which is at oh and a show uh i guess the minnesota's college hockey team lost the ncaa  hockey championships over the weekend and uh completely  destroyed uh this announcer's uh live shot that he was doing for the news so it's a really  really funny video if you haven't checked it out but i mean the news of the day certainly 
[02:21:30]  was finding out that auto from auto and george passed away now we're not we don't know how it  happened uh i believe we know that he apparently died in his sleep um but he was a part of the  ona show for years and years back to the wnew days i mean easily  10 to 12 years he's been doing the ona show and i mean you heard if you were listening to the  end of the show you heard his set on letterman and i mean even as filthy a comedian as auto was 
[02:22:00]  even on letterman he's able to pull off a set like that which was hilarious all of us the mics were  off but all of us in the studio were laughing he was of course part of the traveling virus  tour that we did for a couple years uh and that's the thing he was able to pull off  doing a set on letterman as well as going in front of an audience that really it when it boiled down 
[02:22:30]  to it the reason that they stopped opie and anthony stopped doing the traveling virus tour was because  the audience was simply out for blood i mean they would go out of their way to make life tough for  the comedians on stage and auto would just constantly have them in the palm of his hand  uh such an interesting guy too do do we have uh an auto and george clip to start sal yeah uh do you  want that uh gonorrhea clip that they were talking yeah we were talking about the gonorrhea clip a little 
[02:23:00]  earlier let's uh let's let's hear that hmm i thought i almost wish i was gay because  passed on his hands and i would love to rape him yeah but is he doing pretty good yeah pretty good  gentle yeah very nice did you have a cheeseburger for dinner last night yeah i was doing that  oh that must have been me oh i burped i was like no i had no cheeseburgers  he's got to be the happy clown always i know it's like toward johnson bobbing for gonorrhea 
[02:23:30]  hey hey i i have i have no gonorrhea don't give me a complex  yeah don't give her a simplex we don't even have to bother later yeah we don't even have to  bother later holy shit does that conjure an image 
[02:24:00]  pat how's it going it's going it's going  and that's what it would be like one of those spots that was pat from munaki performing oral sex on a  woman i believe this was way back when we were on 57th street and there was there were no bosses around 
[02:24:30]  to tell us that was completely against the rules but that's kind of a tough spot for a comedian to  be in because generally not a lot is going to be able to take away from the attention to what's going  on in the room but auto was just i mean he was a sniper with his lines he would that i think he might  have been him and davital are probably the two best one-line artists to come into the open anthony  studio maybe ever intern adrian you uh auto and george fan yes well do you remember the the your 
[02:25:00]  first exposure with this show yeah listen to some of the older clips yeah um especially the one a  lot of college brought up between him and jay moore yeah yeah yeah and they argue about that but then  like it kind of because it's such a ridiculous premise like they were arguing over who compared  you who to diarrhea first yeah and then but then it leads you to listening to the actual joke and  you're like holy shit there's something about when auto does this it's an art yeah he was great you  know uh let's go to brady in louisiana what's up brady hey i wanted to reflect on my first experience 
[02:25:30]  with auto and george it was uh seventh grade back in uh when uh xm before serious and xm merged and  it was on the old comedy channel i forget what the name of it was and it was me my mom and my  dad in the car and auto and george came on and all of a sudden they just started telling cunt jokes  out of nowhere and so dad and i are just howling and we listened to this for about a minute and a  half before mom makes us turn it off and i was laughing for like five minutes after that and then 
[02:26:00]  came on on your guys a show and it's really my first venture in the truly filthy comedy and i  wanted to thank him for that and isn't it an amazing thing that somebody because auto was among  the filthiest comics uh anywhere and that somebody who has taken as much heat as he has for being  filthy is bringing a father and a son together i mean i don't know what that says about you and  your dad but you guys are bonding over all these over all these c-bombs yeah it was a great great 
[02:26:30]  family moment all right all right thanks brady uh eric in new york yeah hi sam uh just so sad to  to hear him go i mean every time i hear about him in george it just brings me back my reference point  to to the mujon commercial on waw it's just a classic classic bit and just came out of nowhere yeah we  played that during the show a little earlier but it was i mean it was just he didn't know it was a 
[02:27:00]  live read he didn't know it was just like here let me tell you about this and he was able to just  riff and create this thing that is maintained for over a decade just amazing uh just one more  question for you um i may have gotten my uh uh a ticket or two for uh for the unmask would  would opium anthony mind if i bring lady dyes a date yeah i think they probably would mind but  i mean if you have an extra ticket what can we do 
[02:27:30]  yeah i guess i would like to use it i mean they probably yeah they'd probably be upset  about that okay then i won't upset all right i'll talk to you later i'll see you uh i'll see  you on thursday at unmask all right bye bye jay in nyack oh professional broadcaster sam roberts  it's an honor to be on your show my friend well thank you um i share a lot of the same passion as you do  with uh with wrestling and wwe and and uh i just um i i couldn't believe uh when i turned the radio 
[02:28:00]  on and heard um about otto i uh i don't have any really great funny stories unfortunately um other  than the fact that he made me laugh every time he was on on your show or you know on ona yeah um and  it's just like uh i remember he was supposed to be on a couple of months ago or something and he  could didn't show up and you guys were like you know we can't reach him and i i had a bad feeling  right then because i know he you know uh he had issues in the past and i just hope uh and pray 
[02:28:30]  wherever he is now he's happy and he rests in peace and and and just you know just lots of love and and  and appreciation to him and his family and uh to the whole otto and george you know family of of  comedians i'm sure jim jimmy norton is it's got to be you know and that's that's uh a shout out to  jim norton if i could yeah i missed his advice show uh-huh and uh you know i i wish i had more  to add to that today right no that's good thanks jay uh yeah man thanks a lot and that's that's the 
[02:29:00]  that's the thing that uh you know he did the every he was guaranteed that he was gonna slaughter every  time he came on the ona show like it wasn't about you know the long-form bits it wasn't it was  whatever was going on in the studio that day would just be peppered in by some of the  most uh disgusting wittiest one-liners anywhere let's go to bello in staten island 
[02:29:30]  hey sammy i was just thinking the first time i saw him was probably 30 years ago in a bar in staten  island and i'm always drunk and everything but like you said he just he just took control and it  was amazing and that's it like you're in a bar in staten island i'm sure everybody's everybody's  drinking you know it's just the worst crowd to perform in front of and he would just grab you  yes and he said that choker what do you call for puerto rican the quicksand cuatro cinco 
[02:30:00]  loved it and i love you sammy thanks bro thank you bello uh 866 wow on wow 866-969-1969 if you want to call  up the post show and talk a little bit about uh auto because the other thing about it is and he  was like he was the nicest guy that you'll ever meet i mean when i was doing my sunday show live  he came up one sunday and said sam i'm you know yeah i want to come up and do your show and i said of  course and we got to talking and past all the all all his his act he was one of the most interesting 
[02:30:30]  people that you'll ever encounter just because of his life experiences like this was a guy who from  the time he was a kid was performing on the streets of new york like he was doing his ventriloquist act  as a teenager on the sidewalk in new york city back when new york city was like real new york city  you know like taxi driver new york city i mean he's got stories about being approached by john  lennon he performed for john lennon on the street his david copperfield the magician in vegas was 
[02:31:00]  such a big auto and george fan that he has one of the original george puppets in his private  collection that's true i mean it's amazing the amount of lives that this guy touched uh what's the  next uh auto bit that we want to play for the folks sal uh we have uh auto on jeff dunham yeah yeah  let's hear that because you know you obviously there are not a lot of successful ventriloquist 
[02:31:30]  acts so we have yeah auto talking about jeff like every radio show i've ever done they always they  always try and goat me into bad mouthing jeff dunham i have nothing against the guy i mean to me he's  more of um like a jim henson than what i do i have the one character that's a domineering character  he's got a thousand little creatures and uh they always try and like get me to bash the guy  i have nothing you know yeah that fucking rich guy yeah i mean that successful guy he's an  interesting guy i've had him on he's a wonderful entertainer he's cool talk i have a great dunham 
[02:32:00]  story i was playing in vegas years ago at the riviera and was working for uh steve shiripa  bobby bakalov and the sopranos so i play in the the comedy room which is like a 300 seat room  and dunham he booked dunham the same week as me in the big room with dean martin used to play and all i  see is dunham's picture all over the casino in the elevators and normally when i arrived at the  hotel i'd see my picture within five minutes of walking in the hotel so i called up sheriff and 
[02:32:30]  he's a scary guy to talk to you know every conversation he says i'll bury you in the  desert if you don't do the full time you know that's how he talks to you he's a big intimidating  guy i can see why they hired him for that role and uh so i called him up pretty much screaming at him  i go what why is dunham here the same week as me why is there two ventriloquists why is his picture  everywhere he goes are you giving me shit he goes you're funny and he's not if he goes if you give  me any more shit i'll kick everybody out of this fucking hotel and put puppets in every room  and then we immediately both of us just cracked up at the absurdity of that statement 
[02:33:00]  i'll put puppets in every room and then he just started laughing and just a  fucking it was so absurd fucking crazy i couldn't believe i screamed at him no yeah yeah  because that's a weird booking to have both you guys i didn't get it i didn't get it did you have  people show up kind of dumb yeah i had a normal the pen jillette always brings 50 people to see me  when dunham came and he was grobbling and kissing my ass oh wow um it was great you know he was a really 
[02:33:30]  nice guy that's the i mean you don't have to stop mid-word but uh that's the other thing i mean you just  heard pen jillette goes and brings i mean pen jillette who does the show all the time maybe  we'll try to get him on the phone or something tomorrow because i'd love to hear his reflections  pen adores auto i mean i've never he has come on this show so many times and talk about to talk about  the affection that he has for auto and i know that last caller a couple callers ago had said that they 
[02:34:00]  had heard that he uh had had problems or whatever but as far as any of us know here at the show uh he  was in good health you know auto has had somewhat of a history with some substances or whatever but as  far as any of us know and bob levy was on the show uh today to talk about it a little bit he was not  using um he had had health problems about a year ago he was stuck in canada and he was hospitalized  but he recovered from that and he had been on the show since then and he seemed healthy and 
[02:34:30]  everything so you know i just don't want anybody to jump to conclusions as to what uh caused the  death of auto which is what we're talking about today um but again if you have any uh anything you  want to add to the conversation call up 866-WOW1-WOW 866-969-1969 uh and we have uh one more clip  that we want to play before we run out of time is that right sal yes it's uh lady palms auto in the 
[02:35:00]  head of course one of my favorite things we did a gig in delaware yeah it's a giant  fucking this is many years ago a giant uh room like a big bar and afterwards uh i was out there  and auto killed and i had a great set and there was a girl that walked up to uh me and uh she didn't  know auto was the ventriloquist because he didn't have george with him in the parking lot and she just  everyone focuses on george so she goes you were really funny and she goes uh i liked you more than  the last guy and she was he was really funny but he was more of a guy's comic like she did enjoy you 
[02:35:30]  but you know you're very harsh for a young fucking girl yeah and and uh her head was not shaped good  oh she had a really bad hairline and uh oh no and she said when she said like he was a good comic but  more of a guy's comic auto said yeah well you're really pretty except for your forehead it's too  big and she was so hurt she took her palm and she palmed auto with the forehead 
[02:36:00]  holy shit wow she must have been upset it was so uncomfortable and  fucking great good good fuck car did you like that it's one of my said the worst thing to say  i remember that exchange in the parking lot like it happened four minutes ago  that's hilarious what did you laugh at more the me getting hit or her the whole thing of it was  the fact the fact that you just you you went to you you went her making an off-handed  park you went right for the achilles yeah you sliced her achilles and because you said forehead she 
[02:36:30]  just palmed your forehead she didn't know how to react it was everything that she's ever been  afraid a guy would say to her right no guy has ever said that like they've all talked to her  and looked up and her fucking bad hairline but she sees the eyes go up but she's never actually  had a guy say it to her wow oh man it's too big yeah wow in hindsight she did try and spare my  feelings by saying i'm a guy kind of you know all that she didn't know it was you at first for a  second but she really what she was saying that sincerely yeah she just thought you were harsh but 
[02:37:00]  funny god i'm a vindictive vicious asshole she'll learn hydrocephalous head  she'll learn it's time to fucking think before she speaks she taught her a lesson  that's why that's what this is what makes auto like the comedian's favorite comedian  because he goes and gets smacked in his head in the parking lot and he talks about what a funny  story it was there are a lot of people who would not enjoy repeating the fact that one of the 
[02:37:30]  audience members was so upset by what they said that they had to physically assault them but  auto was a real comedian chris in jersey hey i was just wondering if you think that nancy grace  believed that it was steroids that killed auto you know i wouldn't be surprised if that miserable  person decided to launch an investigation into the deaths of comedians as many as we've had uh  recently well uh again i think jim florentine is going to be on the show tomorrow so i'm sure we'll 
[02:38:00]  talk more about it then hopefully we'll get some more information because i know when stuff like  this happens especially with somebody i guess people listen to this show regularly and religiously  and they kind of you feel close to the people that you hear on opian anthony so everybody's going to  want to know uh what happened with auto and and we'll get that information to you as soon as humanly  possible shane in new york hey what's up sam i was i was on your i was on your show with auto um  he brought me in and just just as a friend that that guy was one of the best fucking guys 
[02:38:30]  i'm just i i'm just beside myself right now man i mean and that's what that's what i don't want  people to lose is the because he's he was such a brutal comic that like he's one of the sweetest  guys that ever walked into the studio absolutely i mean it's for him to bring me on i mean because he  he liked the way i just told it told a story um it's just it's i i i'm i'm sorry i'm repeating  myself i'm just i'm freaking out brother yeah well good luck man that's tough joe in jersey 
[02:39:00]  hey what's up sam how you doing buddy um one of the best stories about auto uh with the john lennon  thing yeah is what had happened was he was you know performing and john lennon's there with yoko  and he's doing his bed and john lennon walks up to him and gives him two bucks he says here  a dollar fifty for the puppet and fifty cents for you because you didn't do that much  and the best part the best part of it is that um and then as lennon goes by lennon gives him an elbow 
[02:39:30]  you know like with your pals you get a little he gives auto like a shove and we were talking about  one day i'm like i don't know what are you a pussy why'd you let him do that he's like dude he was a  fucking beetle yeah yeah if he was one of the monkeys it would have been go time  it's a really uh horrific uh horrific day for um you know for us uh you know who were really tight

[02:59:00]  you're listening to the opium anthony channel on sirius xm  the joe rogan experience begins  now buckle up some bitches here we go you gotta go with your right name dude you gotta go  yeah you gotta go with that i fuck all these these silly people that can't say that learn how to 
[02:59:30]  say that oh onion well i i'll tell you the uh well i mean my father so my father was born in the states  both of his parents uh had were part of the generation that came over so my dad pronounces it oh  hanging as well so but i'll tell you this i i'll tell you what i own see that first name alexis you  never call me alex oh okay i like that you grow up as a little pudgy kid named alexis and you learn  real quick to own that name oh that's awesome because i was i was born in in 83 and my father  named me after a boxer uh alexis arguello this nicaraguan fighter i know exactly who he is i got 
[03:00:00]  to see him fight live serious yeah yeah i got to see him fight live a long time ago me and my friend  jimmy lawless we went down to i think it was in lowell massachusetts we saw alexis arguello live and we  saw mickey ward live before he became famous you should have brought my father what am i doing here  oh it was awesome it was awesome in lowell it was fucking great lowell massachusetts which is where  mickey ward was from so when he went out there yeah i got to see him when he was an up-and-coming  contender live but he's seen our grail that's my pop he showed me he has an entire closet full of vhs 
[03:00:30]  tapes of his fights which i keep telling he needs to do something about that is digitized now but now i  just go on youtube and i can run a quick quick query and um he had a wonderful mustache an amazing left  jab and that combination well alexis aguer was awesome his straight right hand was a work of  art and a gentleman yeah a really really good guy like a real man a real man's man so that's that was 
[03:01:00]  my namesake he died young right he did it was a suicide if you i've talked to nicaraguans about this  and there you know he got very involved politically after his fighting days and there are a lot of  people who believe there was more to that story no way that never happens nobody ever kills anybody  and tries to make it look like a suicide it's never happened bro it's been snoped have you ever  snoped it i love my snopes yeah i love snopes too snopes and a lot of stupid fucking arguments  real quick this is one of the advantages of the interwebs i know what you mean isn't that like 
[03:01:30]  they're snooping for the facts no no i think it's snopes yeah yeah if it was snoops it would have  two o's you could probably check snopes for this though if the english language wasn't so goofy and  there wasn't any weird exceptions like that it would be so easy to shit on you right now but  there's a lot of ones that don't make any sense it's a pretty fucked up language yeah this is very  bizarre and it's more bizarre when you're working with you know words like oh onion i know man you  know it's like it fits it or you know that's one of the reasons why you got to give schwarzenegger 
[03:02:00]  his props that's a bold goddamn move the guy owned schwarzenegger arnold and arnold too arnold is  fucking that's the kid from different strokes you know i mean it's not the manliest most manly  bodybuilder ever he made it though fuck yeah he did see see arnold uh definitely uh definitely a  fighter i i know i'm not i i didn't fulfill my father's prophecy of me being a boxer instead i guess  i'm a lover not a fighter well i tell myself you figured your own path out sir thank goodness thank 
[03:02:30]  god for computers you don't have to be a fighter like in the physical form obviously you figured out a  way to succeed you figured out some cool for sure i mean that's what everybody admired about alexis  arguello was the same thing that anybody admires about anybody who is involved in the creation of  something cool and you're involved in the creation of the coolest fucking website on the internet i  certainly like to think so in reddit yeah you can't get a better hub of information like when new  things innovation a lot of gossipy bullshit but that's people that's the internet people that's 
[03:03:00]  what we do as people we like to talk shit but other than that i mean the the resource if anything  is going down anywhere in the world at any time you can pretty much find it at reddit and it gets  verified the vote up system like good posts rise to the top bad posts fall down it's such a smart cool  thing and really the model i think for like online discourse when it comes to like message board type  discourse i think you guys are the model you know we i mean it's it's amazing uh when steve steve hoffman 
[03:03:30]  my co-founder and i started this thing we were in a little apartment in medford massachusetts i  lived in medford medford we were on 72 i feel bad for whoever lives there now can i say that no don't  say it definitely not but it's no i don't want to get in trouble yeah it's on fucking you know  whatever what's with the questions but the uh medford medford yeah it was it was a great we just  graduated from college just graduated uva went up to boston we raised 12 grand from y combinator 
[03:04:00]  uh which would go on to invest in like dropbox airbnb and and reddit um and with 12 grand in  the bank we worked our asses off for three months in that little apartment and built reddit and it's  to be a top of the website now 150 million people a month it's crazy it's crazy i love hearing  shit like that it's crazy and that's so cool that's the american dream man that is the american  dream we were just some nerds with with with 12 grand in the bank total we just we just worked  with a couple laptops no connections and and and you know well what's the american dream right i mean  the american dream where your parents somewhere in their past they're either their parents or their 
[03:04:30]  parents parents were came from over from armenia oh yeah yeah my father's side fled the genocide so  what year was this we're talking about the early 1900s yeah so 1915 was when it got started if you  want to get really real so my birthday is april 24th which is the remembrance day of the genocide  so like i'm so i'm half armenian on my father's side i'm full-on armenian on my mother's side  i'm full-on german she actually immigrated she was fresh off the boat from deutschland 
[03:05:00]  wow so it's a really interesting 20th century dude your dna has gone through some shit yeah it's  it's a range too yeah and uh and i feel like having i mean right there yeah certainly from the armenian  side you know they came out of survival my mom actually came for love to marry my dad very romantic  um but but both of them right you know the reality was um leaving her life she was on track to be like  a pharmacist in germany but coming to the states she was just an ignorant like degree-less uh immigrant  right in quote unquote um and so she worked jobs that she had to work just because it was paying the 
[03:05:30]  bills like she worked as an au pair she worked in i'm so incredibly like proud of what she did to  leave a life behind a comfortable great life in germany to start fresh here um and then obviously my  father's family like you know when you grow up with a bunch of armenians you know real quick how lucky  you are to have that sort of genetic lottery of being born here instead of over there yeah i didn't  i was totally ignorant to uh the the genocide um until uh i was interviewing a fighter manny gambarian 
[03:06:00]  after one of his fights and um he was dedicating his victory to the victims of the uh armenian  genocide and he was like trying to bring awareness to it i was like wow good for him i mean yeah oh he's  very proud armenian so i had to look it up and find out what it was all about but that's one of  those ones that you you don't hear about too much another horrific event in uh human history it is uh  it is certainly really unspoken and i i'm trying to think i discovered system of a down because i was 
[03:06:30]  listening in 98 rock back in uh maryland and i heard sarge talking about the genocide and i was like  who is on a rock station talking about the armenian genocide and i'm like oh armenian rock band isn't it  crazy how one event like that can make i mean it's not that armenians wouldn't be have like  nationalistic pride or pride of origin before that but that one event has everybody bonded together so  much more and especially because a lot of folks don't even know about the armenian genocide it is  and i was a history major too in school so i've thought a lot about this um i think and it's partially 
[03:07:00]  because it is unrecognized in turkey and even here in the u.s on a national level but it's this it i  think it's the fact that it's still this open wound and it seems it may seem moot like i understand the  people who committed this are long dead right um but it's i think it has such an effect on the psyche  because we're all like well hold on this like they're to deny the existence that this thing happened  is is so incredibly offensive because it's not doing justice to all the people we know it's crazy 
[03:07:30]  that we're having this conversation because just 17 hours ago the u.s senate committee passed an  armenian genocide resolution seriously yep so it's still got to go to the house or did it already it  says i don't know how it works i'm kind of ignorant but it says 12 senators voted for the resolution i  feel like when i when i have to pay attention to how the government works as far as like senators  and congressmen and representatives i get angry it hurts so i just i just shut it off i don't want to  know who has to go to who you know why because your system sucks it's broken this is such 
[03:08:00]  a donkey ass old cane system made when people are riding horses and hurling bows and arrows at each  other this system's retarded so you make me know who is it well it has to go through the house and  the house passes the senator the senator must pass muster the out of here it's dumb and it is uh it  has been so co-opted by money and and and it's it's frustrating it is and and i am an optimist don't get  me wrong i still i think the internet i mean the reason the reason in part i wrote the book the reason i  campaigned against sopa pipa was i really believe the internet can be a way for us to get the 
[03:08:30]  government that we deserve i completely agree it's just it's a process and there's a lot of a lot of  to get through in the meantime well i think what the process really is is in changing the way people's  minds operate and i think that that process without a doubt has already begun i think kids of today i'm  46 years old so anyone who's uh in their 20s i guess i'd be talking about kids of today they're men but  they're kids they are so much more advanced than i ever was when i was at that age than i was i was a 
[03:09:00]  monkey i knew nothing i knew neighborhood couple books uh you know cnn news every now and then i knew  nothing yeah it's uh it's it's amazing and it is i i visited 77 universities on the tour and it makes me  makes me jealous frankly it makes me very hopeful too but like these kids yeah but but look this is  like these kids grew up like i i remember getting that modem i had a 33.6 in middle school i remember 
[03:09:30]  getting my first pc it was a 486 sx my parents i was lucky enough to get that when i got it in middle  school right my parents didn't have a ton of money and they didn't know about technology but they knew  enough and i got that chance and that has provided everything for me but there are kids coming up  today who by and large have known this technology from jump and they've known they have they don't  know what a dial-up sounds like that's insane and so they think of knowledge as being something in  real time like like you were saying earlier you know we we're sort of developing this attitude of  like all right we can go seek out this information we can squelch gossip on snopes or we can go learn 
[03:10:00]  how to do we can learn string theory on khan academy but this generation coming up they just on  they take it for granted because they just know oh i have a problem or i need to figure something  out or i want to create something and share it like the internet uh and that's how that's how all  of us got to learn the programming languages that helped us build things like reddit but it's helping  filmmakers right now it's helping artists it's helping photographers helping comedians right like  think of the wealth of knowledge that the up-and-coming comic now has to learn from to look to share  like it's yeah the amount of the resource of just finding things to talk about as long as they 
[03:10:30]  don't men see it though can't can't do that it's horrible that's a verb now um but the like the  the amount of internet like uh internet websites internet search engines amount of uh social media  networks whether it's facebook or twitter the the just a sheer amount of funny stories that are coming  your way as a comic today yeah it's like if you can't write new material it's like you're just not  paying attention it's not like the old days you had to wait for shit to happen you know living in 
[03:11:00]  fucking pennsylvania and just looking left and look come on i need something to talk about like  now you go online it's like it's constant it's overflowing it kind of sucks though because they  know the same comics are also looking at the same news stories uh writing jokes about that that's  totally gonna happen that's totally gonna happen without a doubt like uh i was doing something about  almond milk and somebody uh let me know on the podcast that what's his face um lewis black has a great  hunk on soy milk it's basically the same joke and uh like you find that out because the internet too 
[03:11:30]  but you that the good thing is you like i wouldn't have known that unless i then i would like that  joe could have made it into my arsenal and then i wouldn't have even known that lewis black had it  and then you know it would be i would be accused of plagiarism and i would feel stupid can you change  almond milk to something else like i don't know it's not important it's it's a tiny part of the bit but  because of the internet i know all this and and think about it this way right like the the speed  with which you can learn shit this is this brings everyone up like it forces us this is and we see 
[03:12:00]  this in tech all the time um just because of the nature of writing code and creating applications you  know competition is this is as efficient as it gets there's new stuff coming out every day and it  forces you to stay up and to be innovating and be pushing and now i think of it as there are so many  more in this instance like comics who are connected who are watching who who are seeing what someone is  doing they're like all right like i'm not going to take that joke but now i just gotta i have to  i have to push harder faster and on the whole i think we all benefit because we'll get better  jokes we'll get better comedians benefit there's the the artistic expression will benefit the real 
[03:12:30]  problem with plagiarism whether it's in that or blogs you see them blogs a lot i mean people still  are getting busted for it yeah remember the rightfully so yeah absolutely but the the difference  between the mindset is what's really important like the the the guy who's an actual writer the guy  who or the girl who's an actual writer the girl who's an actual comic what they're trying to do  is figure out and they're trying to find ridiculous points and things and then make 
[03:13:00]  funny observations about those points if you're just copying stuff then you're not exercising  whatever it is that tunes you into those ideas in the first place so that you're lost when you're  done if you you get busted stealing jokes and then you have to write your own you're like holy  shit like i don't even know how to do this like you're like an open miker that's why you see like  the guys have been accused of plagiarism there's just like a high period in their careers and then  this massive drop off where you look at and you go oh my god like who the fuck is writing this like 
[03:13:30]  this isn't funny at all like you went from being this guy with these really funny points  to this monkey with dog shit coming out of your mouth and what is that which could be the act yeah it's  it's a good act it's probably better than your jokes but it's because they never really did it  in the first place they were just stealing and that that mindset there they seem to be mutually  exclusive like people who are really creative are almost never the type of person that would even  think about plagiarizing so it's kind of fascinating how it's a but something like reddit exposes that 
[03:14:00]  quick like this i found out about this found about this on twitter but the just social media just the  the ability to communicate with the people yeah it's just it's unprecedented and and i you have  to i mean in in 05 two of us in a little apartment there's no twitter there's no tumblr facebook is  still in colleges it's still in like elite colleges back then it was a different world but and to give  credit where it's due i mean i really i do believe we're all standing on the shoulders of giants um also  not my quote but like you know the message board right that's nothing new right there we had message 
[03:14:30]  boards i ran a message board in college uh forum um you know before that did they come out like  what was the first year of the message board ah well i mean really early internet you've got bbs systems  um you've got i mean they're like the forum usenet you've got forum like basic forum software where  someone creates an account usually with like a pseudonym right they create an account they post a link or  they have a discussion this stuff this stuff is as old as the internet as the worldwide web what what  steve and i got right was we adapted it modernized it a bit because we'd let people you know at large 
[03:15:00]  upvote or downvote um and and essentially i mean i hate to simplify it that much but reddit is like  a next generation forum platform and then what we realized that dig and all the dig clones didn't  realize was that they were just one front page we knew if we were going to win we would have to be  a platform for communities dig was a platform for a community right the front page would only have so  much stuff on it but we knew you know steve and i knew that yeah we had a you know there were things  we were interested in right we're interested in technology we're interested in the redskins we're 
[03:15:30]  interested in like just football like we might have a certain audience um but what's going to  make this work is if anyone who has a particular community or a following whether you love my  little pony and want to create a reddit about that a subreddit which there are lots or you want to  create about your favorite team or you want to create about your favorite tv show or just about  science or asking questions about science ask science amazing sub all these things exist because  we knew this has to be a platform just like twitter is a platform for individuals this would be a  platform for communities it's just amazing that it's been able to be pulled off the way it is 
[03:16:00]  that the vote up vote down system is such a brilliant system because steve you're always going to have  noise you're always going to have people that just want to make noise you're always going to have  people that just want to be twats and now you can sort of at least without censoring you sort of just  push that to the bottom and it's not perfect i i will argue and this is all to steve's credit  yeah i mean there is no perfect system we constantly fight against ring voting all that stuff  but um steve built a really smart system with a really smart hotness algorithm and by the way we're 
[03:16:30]  open source so if you want that go take it it's it's there um and and i think it is for what it is  it's one of the best on the web and i think that's why our content is so good it used to be  right we started with just people linking stuff out the first link on reddit fun fact was a submission  i made to the downing street memo remember that it was it was showing this this leaked memo during  the run-up to the iraq war the english government kind of saying like hey we're going to drum up some  you know uh support here to support america going into this war and um it was my first submission  and it was a link to another was that the proposed false flag event yes it was well the the the notion 
[03:17:00]  being we could pull this thing up um the notion being that like uh downing street memo and so this was  leaked out as basically an indication that the british government really wanted to help drum up support  for the war i don't know how explicit it was i don't recall if it was like an explicit like  i guess they wouldn't call it a false flag thing in the memo but we're going to do a stunt but yeah  what if they have like code words and then the big bad wolf says but this this was the first submission 
[03:17:30]  to reddit and it wasn't that new at the time but i was just thinking like hey what if it would be if  this thing actually worked like what would we want reddit to be a place to like find and have people  link to and this seemed like the perfect thing right the internet enabled some person to put this  image of a leaked document online and share the world right now massive printing press and uh but  what's crazy is we thought that's how it was going to always be maybe like three years in some user 
[03:18:00]  because users are fucking clever um linked to a comments page like they knew when they hit submit  what the link would be like the number the random number well not quite random the sequential  number we would generate and so they linked to what they effectively do is create a  self post which is now a feature in the site but basically reddit only used to let people link out  to other sites one user hacked it and learned you could just link to itself and create this amazing  comment thread so you wouldn't you know when you click on it when you do an ama right you're not  creating something that links somewhere else you're creating something that just creates a reddit 
[03:18:30]  comment page and what that user did by hacking the site was show that there was a tremendous value  and just saying hey people have a discussion about whatever it is and today i i believe it's a little  less than half of our like content is actually linking to reddit so it's actually it's an ama or  it's an ask historians post or it's just people talking about it it's not even linking to other  content on the internet and we never could have seen that coming wow that's awesome and it was just  the user being creative uh basically hacking our site to you know in the that that word we need to take 
[03:19:00]  back right we need to take that word because it's not make it a positive thing yeah it's you can  life hack you and you see this right you can life how you can you can body hack you can basically  find a understand the system so well that you can find an optimal way to use it to your advantage  that's it that's hacking it's not it's not the like angelina jolie bagging on a keyboard  hoodie and like doing evil it can be but it's it's a much more innocuous word yeah it's it seems to 
[03:19:30]  have weird it's it's got a combination of meanings it's like some people use it in a negative  way but some people look use it in a positive way like dude i fucking hacked the system yeah  like someone someone's saying i hacked the system that's that that's you know that's in a positive  way but all these hackers broke into this website and put dicks in everybody's picture you know like  that's how we look at it we we also have this weird sort of connection to adolescence like adolescent  pranks hacking being some sort of an adolescent prankster type behavior which i don't think is fair 
[03:20:00]  either you know what it is and you know that's an interesting point there are there's definitely  the there's a there was a there has always been a spirit of like pranking yeah in the hacker community  like i'm talking like og hackers like mit building early like steve wozniak being example um and i think  what's cool is there's that childlike wonder like because i think a lot of that shit usually gets beaten  out of us as we get older right um especially in a lot of traditional industries and whatnot and so i'd like  to believe that that can even like be an excuse for people to think about stuff a little differently 
[03:20:30]  and think about stuff a little more like let's take things a lot seriously um as part of that  broader cultural yeah no it's cool that there's a prankster type thing rather than an evil vicious  mean type thing you know like when they hack someone's and they put a smiley face on their front  page instead that's kind of funny i mean it's kind of funny you know well now we know that someone can  hack into your page i mean in a way it's probably good that you know that that's possible yeah no i 
[03:21:00]  don't encourage people to just go hacking anybody's website because it fucks up that person's day but  all in all overall you should be lucky that someone's doing that and that if they're doing it hopefully  they're not stealing your credit card information and doing it maliciously there's a whole i mean there  we can i can dig into this there's the so there's the white so like the white hat hacker is the  quintessential like hey i found out there's a problem with your website right i'm not going to  exploit it i'm just telling you so you need to fix it or hire me and fix but usually just like 
[03:21:30]  and we had we've had white hat hackers um periodically emailing us with exploits on reddit that have done  us a huge service um because they told us about this thing we could i mean you can't possibly know  every no you can't you know yeah it's interesting man it's it's the the amount of information that's  available now has got it so it's it's so the world is so wired that it's like we're standing in this  crazy river of ideas that are just constantly flying by us and a few people are looking around 
[03:22:00]  poking their head up out of the water and just looking at each other going holy shit and  the the internet is where it all sort of pools together i mean that's the channel for it all and  that's where it all pools together in places like reddit or places like twitter all over where  just you think about how much you know now how many things you've been exposed to now how many  strange bits of information all the chaos that was caused by wiki leaks and edward snowden and all this  stuff what where's all this coming from well it's all on the internet the internet is it just boom 
[03:22:30]  booms like these shots are being fired these holes are being exploded into the system and then you know  there's a bunch of scrambling to try to put scaffolding up where the hole was and boom another  hole gets blown out of the fucking society standards it is weird it is is probably a really scary time to  be an incumbent uh oh yeah but it's a great time to be an upstart it's a great time to be someone who is 
[03:23:00]  trying to find a way to get their ideas to the world because there's never been a better time yeah  there's never been a better time to be an honest politician it's a good good move it would be and that's  that's just it right that brings us like i i god i hope we get there because we need to i'm a big  fan of the states and i think we can evolve i really do it's just gonna take a lot it's just  gonna take a lot of these old fucks getting out of office these people that have been doing it  in a sneaky dirty underhanded way since the jump i mean there's fucking people in office that were  alive when kennedy was assassination and they were they're like in government and they're still they're 
[03:23:30]  still involved i don't think it was supposed to be a career uh pretty sure pretty sure the founding  fathers didn't want it to be a career yeah it was the exact opposite of that it's a service that's  one of the reasons why they wanted to put term limits they wanted to make sure they they don't  get too much of a stranglehold on how things operate because men just do that men are creepy  fucks when we get power some of us they get to positions of power like that they just distort  things to their advantage and then you're stuck with lobbyists and you're stuck with these 
[03:24:00]  arlen specter type dudes and who's also involved in the single bullet theory he's one of those long  term yeah really yeah he was the guy who came up with the idea he was the that's like when people  say the single bullet theory you know you're looking at it all wrong arlen specter that guy  that guy came up with it that's how goofy that idea was one bullet went through two  people and caused all this fucking damage in their body and barely like barely dented the bullet the 
[03:24:30]  bullet looked beautiful little pieces of bullet in their bodies nothing missing from the bullet  whatever whatever this is a magic bullet this is a single bullet is that arlen specter guy yeah  it's his idea he had to come up with a reason why one bullet had done so much damage people right  now that are anti-kennedy conspiracy theorists are going nuts right now possibly even on reddit  rogan's such a fucking retard with this bullet theory but that all came from our inspector that 
[03:25:00]  all came from that sort of old school politician those guys that had just been around and been a  part of the system for just too long i wonder if it's possible to do to dig i i i mean i want to  i want to be hopeful enough to think that there is a chance for someone to get into it for the right  reasons and then be able to stay in it for the right reasons there is and not get a lot of them  probably mean fuck guys guys like arlen specter i'm sure probably got into it for all the right  reasons but i think there's certain systems that once you get into you just look around you go oh  fuck like it's just such a mess a viper's nest that you're like what it when you're a young guy it's 
[03:25:30]  like did you see the movie uh wolf wall street of course yeah well there's i don't know how much of  it was a hustle you know what i mean i mean whenever you have a story and the guy who it's his life it's  based on the story it's probably going to make him look a little bit nicer than he was a little bit more  innocent in the beginning of the movie but it's that system where you see leonardo di capro he  starts out he's a family man he's a nice guy who drinks water he doesn't want to have anything to do 
[03:26:00]  with drugs and he gets co-opted by the matthew mcconaughey mcconaughey character and then he becomes a  part of this system that's fucked up and so he's a victim he becomes a someone that you can sort of  sympathize with you know how much of that is real yeah that's i i definitely i can only imagine uh  because you got to figure i mean why someone gets into that whole industry actually the whole finance  industry just blows my mind yeah because i really like i really like uh making things and doing 
[03:26:30]  things and and i just can't even wrap my head around getting into work every day and just hustling  like that well it's a crazy way to live those guys are maniacs yeah a guy used to know that i grew up with  he uh became a stockbroker and he was a he was a maniac he was a maniac and all of a sudden he's  like bro we're uh selling stocks and shit it's great it's amazing i saw him in a bar wearing a  a suit with a tie i'm like what the fuck are you doing with a suit on like he was an animal this guy  and all of a sudden he was a stockbroker they're like maniacs a lot of them like wild crazy gambling 
[03:27:00]  risking maniacs they need the fix i think you if you had a job in a system like that and i'm not  equating politicians with with uh these kind of guys with uh stockbrokers but i think what a system  that's equally fucked the political system is equally fucked as a financial system you look  at the both of them you're like wait wait wait why are you doing it like that what is that a  derivative is what does it fuck oh no where did you guys make you're making things up what did you 
[03:27:30]  make yeah you have a hundred billion dollars you don't have any money there's no money here at all  this is crazy that that system is equally fucked to the political system like wait the wait the  fucking hold on a second the supreme court just changed the limits they just made it so that you  can just unload money on politicians citizens united uh yeah i got a nice little jump site  what's crazy it's crazy yeah so i think equal system once you incorporate yourself into it like  a lot of these politicians who probably do go into it with good intentions i think you find along the way 
[03:28:00]  that if you try to buck the system completely you probably get blackballed there's probably going  to be a lot of blowback against you by your party by competing parties you're going to you're going  to be in a tough situation you against the world and that's how they survive they survive by sort of  attacking each other like this and then propping up these individual candidates that differ only slightly  from each other and all of them supported by the same giant hood of money that comes from 
[03:28:30]  corporations it's crazy it's a crazy system so if you're a young guy and you're a senator from  delaware and you decide that you want to i'm going to make some changes in this world and if you elect  me i'm gonna blah blah blah and and then you get in there and you're like oh you're making me really  optimistic right now joe and i and i just got i got off my house of cards bender which you know amazing  those systems are inherently corrupting that's what i'm saying yeah i just think that younger people 
[03:29:00]  have to it it almost has to be like transparency involved in your actions is going to reach such a  tipping point oh yeah that there will be no room for corruption and once that happens different story  yeah and it's got to be on the way there right we all the the forces certainly seem to be on their way  i mean it's crazy we still live in an age where these senators and congress people are still doing what  they're doing on their uh twitter direct messages or uh you mean sending dick pics yo yeah but the  but the funny thing is there's this kind of like okay at a certain point there'll be mutually assured 
[03:29:30]  destruction where like the president is going to have like photos of herself from like a party in  high school right we're going to get to a certain point where everyone's got shit on everyone from  all the stuff we did ever but that's going to take a little while and in the meantime i mean i i hope that  the the the thing that still makes me hopeful is coming back to the sort of finance side of things  um money is the corrupting influence in washington uh one of the biggest and and right now there are  a few people who can put in a lot of money and have a lot of an effect what i hope the internet can do 
[03:30:00]  and we've started seeing this happen is is in the same way that it's given a voice to people through  social media we can start using small amounts of money and in aggregate start having a really big  impact and we saw we've seen these money bombs before in 08 and in 12 but i feel like the software  is going to keep getting better and better with crowdfunding and with these models that are going  to really inspire people to want to give to a candidate and know that there's actually going  to be accountability to with how that's spent and who they are and and whatnot one of the big ones one 
[03:30:30]  of the really big ones that people think is kind of frivolous especially people who don't smoke  marijuana is the legalization of it the legalization of marijuana and in washington state in colorado  is fucking gigantic yeah those are the impacts that it's had on their economy it's been so big  that there's everyone's forced to step back and go wait a minute well okay all right so now we know  it's a lot of times rubbing on their pants and a lot of fucking late night meetings a lot of guys 
[03:31:00]  pacing back and forth a lot of people yelling john they're gonna smoke pot okay they're gonna  fucking smoke no matter what what are we doing here let's make some money yeah we can't we can't fix the  street we can't hire new teachers well and that's the and that's right if if if if that money being  used on the war against drugs were being used for more productive things and we did legalize my  goodness the war against drugs is such a farce crazy idea it's it's a crazy term it's like the war  against breathing you know we figured out drugs it's probably it made people better in a million 
[03:31:30]  different ways the idea that you got a war against it is and it's just you call it drugs you don't make  a distinction the war against negative lethal drugs that are addictive you're not gonna make  any distinctions it's just a war against drugs so you gotta break into the fucking store and  steal all the aspirin at gunpoint like what what is this war you're saying yeah it's ridiculous  it's preposterous and i hope you know it the uh i know dc's i don't know where dc's at right now  i was on the table maryland just decriminalized yeah that's a step in the right direction and i mean  what happens like what what happens if we get legal weed in the district of columbia now i know they're not 
[03:32:00]  technically a state because that's ridiculous it'll happen but it has to but like at one point  you know i like i see the discrepancy between the federal law and the state laws but like  if you're not having feds knocking down doors in the district of columbia like you know i think  maybe everyone's in agreement here and you see so many so many ex-law enforcement so many ex-dea  people come out in support of legalization because they realize if the goal if we have a common goal here  um to actually make our streets safer and actually curb the the criminal element that comes 
[03:32:30]  in with this um legalization is the way to do it and make a lot of money and help help a lot of  people live better lives because they don't have to be treated like criminals for a drug like marijuana  i've never seen a single person that i didn't think was just trolling say that they think that  marijuana should stay illegal anyone worth having a conversation with like when i hear ann coulter  say it i'm like this bitch is trolling she's trolling obviously she's too good at it obvious troll  is obvious she's got a half a smile while she's doing it did you just meme it i did audio 
[03:33:00]  memes that's another cool thing that came out of places like reddit is memes reddit and message  boards these dreams i mean there are obviously uh 4chan is still uh a hub for a lot of that meme creation  i feel like i feel like at this point hub right yes and that's where it all began isn't it the way it is  i mean it is one of the or message boards that's a classic 4chan that picture yeah that's a classic  4chan picture it uh and it's it's it's just it's so interesting because now there are enough basically 
[03:33:30]  right 10 years ago the culture people who were spending a lot of time communicating on forums  online was pretty small right and now right everyone's taking their selfies like it has reached  a point where uh it's nearly a it's so so ubiquitous or so close to it that yeah these these memes these  funny interesting image whatever they are can catch hold and literally millions of people can  see i mean it gets a little weird when you see like rick astley in the thanksgiving day parade a  couple years ago rick rolling everyone that was that's a little that's like a little weird a little 
[03:34:00]  art influencing life in a strange way yeah yeah yeah that was weird man the rick roll it's a strange  thing when something just catches on like a virus like a real disease and spreads across i mean or  an organism almost like a thing with a lifespan we like as i mean as humans we are and and i'm not  i'm not saying plagiarism here but like we are sort of intrinsically copy machines and that like 
[03:34:30]  early man right sees someone else hunting a little better than him and he's like oh i could use that  as a weapon dude this guy this guy over here let's all make weapons right and we are really good at  seeing what someone is doing alert that's how we learn yes and and what's so wild is you know because  of that hyper connectivity because of how fast these ideas now spread right these memes like  humans are sort of naturally really good at this but now we can spread this shit faster than ever  before right within hours million within minutes millions of people can see an interesting photo of  a cat or an interesting video or or what have you you know alexis you can't do that on your own you 
[03:35:00]  didn't get there on your own yeah but i think what obama was trying to say when he was trying to say  that uh you didn't build that you didn't make that he's he's you know about the infrastructure  you know to to build your own small business remember was that speech that he was so criticized  from there was that that that quote was it was definitely taken out of context it was a shit  quote the reality is it was he he said it very poorly like but it's essentially what we're we're  saying is we all needed someone before us to come up with all these ideas that we all piggyback shoulders 
[03:35:30]  of giants man and i everybody look dude i mean i i i have been incredibly fortunate right i saw my company  when i was 23 years old all right that was crazy crazy dude how much coke did you do don't lie i  have actually never done coke good for you thank god if you were hanging out with that guy you've  done coke you would add too much coke and you'd be i'd ask you that question you'd go wow bad things  man weird eyebrow hairs you can't explain like when did that start growing i hate coke oh man it's not i 
[03:36:00]  am i feel like caffeine is enough of a stimulant for me um that i'm more interested in the stuff that you  know calms me down yes chills me out chills me out and that's what i think would change and i think  turkey that's one of the things that that is changing uh right now in in america because of  the fact that the spread of this stuff the the what the spread is starting out first of all information  wise when people found out the real truth about like the ld-50 rates like you can't die from it  like it's not impossible and that malarkey document or film reefer madness it's ridiculous great to 
[03:36:30]  watch now but yeah this is straight propaganda yeah it's um that's a that's a fascinating movie  it's fun to watch today but there's a lot of people that still believe that it does something  negative that it slows you down or it removes motivation i think um people have to realize like  the the motivation for motivation in the first place like what why why is that so inspiring to you  like what is what is motivation you want someone to get off their ass and get a job and get to work 
[03:37:00]  well they just have to be excited about something yeah you know the most likely they're more excited  about sitting on the couch than whatever it is they're being exposed to in their life it doesn't  mean that marijuana removes motivation it means that if you're one of those lazy bitches that doesn't  think outside the box and you're stuck in a spot and you're discontent and you like to get high and  sit on the couch you're probably going to be like that for the rest of your life but that's okay too  it is it is a it's not harming anyone exactly those are the same people who drink cough syrup  yeah drink fucking cough syrup until they you know their liver failed syrup drinking that syrup 
[03:37:30]  i mean for real that is the same they're the same people and the idea that it did all the benefits  reported by people like i'm not saying you smoke a little weed i'm saying probably smoke a little weed  or me or anyone else who does that that's that's all discounted yeah and not to mention i mean  seriously on a from a medical standpoint i mean i you can't fight like every day there's another  story from another person who's using it to get through chemo or using it to get their app like 
[03:38:00]  when you see that many people's lives being so positively affected by a thing that's naturally  occurring like really i it come on guys it's all it's a truly unbelievable shake the stigma the fact  that it's still around in 2014 is really a truly unbelievable story because if you looked at  it logically and factually and said could you imagine a culture in which information is sent  instantaneously all over the globe to which the answer to virtually any question a person can come  up with can be answered on your phone in a matter of seconds that you truly have the information the 
[03:38:30]  current information of the world at your disposal could you imagine there would be one of the most  beneficial plants that grows easily contains essential amino acids it's very high in protein  it can make you think about things differently it can make food taste better it makes sex feel better  it makes you sleep easier it removes anxiety it makes you nicer and kinder this sounds amazing  you would go yeah but it's illegal and it's a schedule one drug and the record screeches and you're like 
[03:39:00]  wait but hold on what it used this was used to be this was a major hemp was a major crop for the 13 colonies  yeah um like well when they figured out the cotton gin that's when things got a little weirder  because um they used to make clothes with hemp but before the 1930s they 1930s they came up with a  thing called a decorticator and the decorticator was it was for the first time they could use this  giant machine to break down the hemp fiber because before they used slavery and then when slavery was 
[03:39:30]  abolished and the cotton gin was invented all along sort of in the same time frame the the shift went to  cotton and away from from him it's really kind of fascinating this is like wikipedia i know a few  things that i've seen in documentaries but it's a fascinating fascinating story because one what was  really what shut down marijuana is the crop hemp that's what shut it down and that's the main reason  why today like when i was talking about on it we can't grow our own hemp we would love to we would 
[03:40:00]  love to pay a farmer to grow hemp for our protein powder that way we could monitor the soil we could make  sure everything's organic we can do all the right steps but we can't do it we can't we literally  can't do it in america land of the free but it's it's totally non-psychoactive that's what's so stupid  like it's it doesn't that what you're getting when you're getting like a hemp bag or you're getting  hemp protein powder there's zero thc in there it's just not in there you cannot smoke kids you cannot  smoke your hemp bag don't try don't do it but the idea that that somehow or another can be illegal 
[03:40:30]  because it's related related to the plant that's crazy i mean that's like a poppy plant like you  could have a poppy plant you could eat a bagel yeah we're bananas it's crazy and then you know  what it is though here's the the real victims of ending the drug war would be all those prisons  that would no longer be full of uh young black men you say this but what if your business is running  prisons right what if your business is prison guards i mean that's not someone someone think of  someone think of the prison uh the prison industrial complex prison guards lobby against 
[03:41:00]  drug legalizations they do it because they want to stay in office they want to keep their jobs and  how many lives have to be ruined in the process it's fucking crazy it's a vampire system it's a  horrible vampire system and it's a system that's brought out of it's it's based on these reverberations  or these vibrations from the past it's all like this scramble when people were retarded when they came  over on boats and this is just how they did things they get him in the clink throw him in the jail 
[03:41:30]  you know scoundrel you were smoking marijuana or whatever the rule that you broke is that they  realize that they can do it so they do do it and they throw you in some cage in 2014 the fact that's  still going on and that people are actually profiting from it this is these are more things that the  internet has a huge problem with because the internet is guys like you as young fellas that are very  smart and unconventional and seeing the system and being like you know what i don't buy it i think  uh there's some shit that people i knew growing up that were adults i knew they were fucking idiots 
[03:42:00]  and i knew they made bad choices and now i'm looking at the the repercussions of this everywhere i'm  looking at it and i'm saying no this is dumb this is so this is one of the things especially talking  to college students that i love bringing up which is that and i'm the first to admit it like i have no  fucking clue what i'm doing 99 of the time especially when i got started i still don't  now and i've i've come to realize like and i've got i've got been lucky enough to meet some pretty  like successful impressive people but like you dig on the surface we're all just hacking it like we're 
[03:42:30]  all just for your expertise experience those things all help but like every one of us is a fallible  human all the conventions and rules and status quo we know were created by other fallible humans yeah  and there's no reason not to look at that and go huh does it have to be that way or why is it that  way and if the reason why is well that's the way it is well that's a terrible reason  you know and and when you see the world as being that hackable so to speak like you start to realize  all right well let's just let's actually question stuff and and for you know i remember i was a 
[03:43:00]  freshman at uva when 9-11 happened for this generation of millennials coming up we we nearly  all of us one of our first really vivid memories of the world was 9-11 this awful tragedy and then we  get into these two wars and then think of all the authority figures we've had in our life since  that moment they've all at one point or another either misled us this sort of deceived us you've  got the financial crisis you've got the housing bubble all these conventions oh trust us we know  we're doing this is the thing the american dream is buying a home go to college take on that student 
[03:43:30]  loan debt don't worry there's a job waiting for you every single one of these conventions from from  all these people in power have not held up and so i think in particular millennial millennials look at  that very skeptically because we're like all right you know what so the conventional stuff didn't work  out for anything like we have no choice but to realize you know what we're all just hacking it so  let's let's really let's dive into the passion let's let's figure out a better way to do something  not settle for uh it's the way it always been i think you're completely right and i think um first  of all i'm slightly annoyed by this new statement that i'm first to absorb millennials i know it's a 
[03:44:00]  terrible phrase i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm not buying we can rebrand this i think we should i really  please because i i think there's a divisiveness or there's a separation that comes when you start  labeling people by like what era they were born in fair enough fair enough it's a it's a state of  mind more than anything else yeah i think so but i think it's horseshit generation x generation  shut the fuck up it's just humans like this this idea of putting things in a label generalization  the human race is evolving watch father knows best and then watch game of thrones okay 
[03:44:30]  shit's different now we don't have to come up with names for the generations and your generation  why and there was fucking jamie from the laugh factory tried to tell my friend uh uh todd parker  todd parker's a stand-up comic that i started out with jamie was like buddy you have to be generation  x guy this is what you do you go on stage and everything my generation generation x think that's  gonna be your hook and i remember him trying to explain it to jamie and i'm in the background 
[03:45:00]  going don't don't don't listen to him did you hear what he told tony to do what he told buddy you must  always wear a cowboy hat that was just thinking he would just look like woody from toy story because  he needed a hat he was shopping for hats did jamie uh the guy who owns jamie masada the guy who owns the  laugh factor is a sweetheart of a guy he is a very nice guy i love him to death but he's crazy and  he gives advice to comedians and he was a comedian at one point in time he might have been the second 
[03:45:30]  or third worst comedian that's ever walked the face of the earth but as a club owner he's like one of  the best he's a sweetheart of a guy he wasn't the worst comedian he just we said second or third barely  speaks english and he's not funny but he's a sweetheart of a guy but his ideas are terrible and  he'll like tell young comedians he'll like pull you aside buddy listen this is your move from here  on out you go on stage you wear superhero costume with falcon you don't look like superhero that's 
[03:46:00]  the joke i i want to know is there a comic somewhere who actually took his advice oh yeah there's been  a bunch there's a bit of i don't want to name any names because it's sort of like someone who got  tricked by a guy who said he was in the military so they had sex with him and then it turns out he was  just a liar and the girl feels bad i don't want to shame anybody okay so i won't say any names okay  but yeah there were some comedians for sure there was definitely some comedians that listened  and changed their their persona you know and came up with like a a plan and not it never worked  because once jammy's got you dancing first of all oh yeah keep now i control the dance 
[03:46:30]  strings buddy you're dancing bad it's not my dance moves are good mitzi did it also with carlos  yeah yeah mitzi made um well i mean i don't know i i don't know exactly i mean allegedly it was  missy's idea but obviously we're not pals with that dude so we probably shouldn't tell his life  story without checking in with it he probably doesn't even know it's so much yeah well i don't  hate the guy just hate what he's doing um but there's been a lot of those club owners that come 
[03:47:00]  up the best club owners are like wendy from denver who just stands back just you know if you're doing  well you're doing well she encourages originality and her clubs have built like a real scene in denver  just because of her like if there's one person that like is important for the the the entire  denver comedy scene this is one lady wendy did did mitzi ever give you any advice that you either took  or didn't you're too dirty you're too dirty you clearly took that advice what you said was sick 
[03:47:30]  it wasn't funny it was sick i used to have this bit about anna nicole smith's husband this is the  one she always hated unfortunately there's no good versions of it online i think there's an audio  version we're gonna let's record it now but it was a um it was all about uh him making her do  ugly things before before he died like that she was earning this money and everybody's like oh she's  stealing his money i'm like what are you talking about the guy made a billion dollars from scratch  don't you think he knows what the fuck is going on like he's he was he was onto it yeah so the joke 
[03:48:00]  was that he was going out in style with this big fat kentucky fried hooker and mitzi would go it's  disgusting it's not funny mike but why is everybody laughing they're fucking idiots  you clearly don't have to i mean this is like hey it's nice advice but like if people are still  laughing and buying drinks she's gonna keep having you well she loved me you know she's nice she's a  sweet woman she just didn't like it wasn't her style of comedy you know i i get it i get that and 
[03:48:30]  there's some things that i did that she really loved and she wanted me to keep doing those and i love  those too but there's shit that i'll do that i i i and i always have because i would laugh at it and  my friends who are comics would laugh at it like i like if i know that stanhope is in the room i'll  probably ramp something up just because i know he's there i'll you know add some extra fucked up  shit to it just to get him to laugh just just something totally inappropriate that i don't even  mean but i'll do it just for stanhope if he's in the room like we do that to each other comics do that 
[03:49:00]  so when when a comic is writing a bit that's like really fucked up like half of it is just like to  make your own jaded sense of comedy like jolt it you know just give a little prod yeah just see oh  man that's i i uh that is the bar that i like because i do a fair bit of public speaking right  but um i don't have to fucking tell jokes like that stand-up bar has to be and i'm not just blowing  smoke like it's got to be the hardest like public speaking gig to have to do it is and it isn't 
[03:49:30]  but to do it night after night too well that actually makes it easier joey diaz says it best  joey diaz he goes this is the easiest hardest thing you can do okay it's the easiest hardest thing you  can do because if you do it right it's easy if you got it down and not in the beginning god damn it  takes a long time to not be on shaky legs every time you go on stage but once you get good enough  to where you kind of like you understand yourself better so he's not as insecure you're not as concerned  about acceptance and you can kind of relax and you're more comfortable in your own skin and then 
[03:50:00]  you kind of understand the roots of humor better as you get older and then you become a comic so  then boom you're a comic um and i think from there it's all just about maintaining it's about continuing  to do it and once you do that it's fairly easy this has been the joe rogan experience expand further  into the rogan universe at joe rogan.net and listen every saturday at 11 a.m and 11 p.m eastern  stay in touch with the o and a show follow our hosts on twitter i have a bad case of diarrhea
