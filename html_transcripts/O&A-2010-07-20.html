<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie detailing a mysteriously cracked iPhone screen (his seventh), jokingly blaming supernatural forces. He then transitioned to a new bit he's developing, "Homeless Roulette," featuring a recurring character: a hostile homeless man wearing women's makeup.  The conversation shifted to Opie's recent Yankee Stadium visit, highlighting the stadium's impressive amenities and contrasting the experience with expected Mets fan negativity.  This led to a discussion about a controversial Mets-Giants game, with callers recounting poorly officiated plays and debating Yankee Stadium seating options and prices.

Opie then recounted a massive party at his house, mentioning guests Bobo, Stalker Patty, and "Crazed" from the Ron and Fez Show, culminating in a late-night keg depletion.  The hosts discussed the challenges of parenthood, sharing anecdotes, including a supermarket encounter with Fred Norris.  A discussion about the death penalty followed, infused with dark humor and irreverent commentary.  Patrice O'Neal was a guest in the studio during this portion.

The death penalty debate continued extensively, including a confrontational call with Renee, whose family members were serving life sentences. This segment was punctuated by homophobic slurs from the hosts.  A caller then recounted a purported CIA operation, "Operation Charles Manson," involving Manson in Iraq.  This sparked a discussion about the plausibility of the story and broader conspiracy theories. The conversation then veered into sports, specifically basketball and hockey, with numerous offensive comments and racial slurs, along with discussion of Tiger Woods's performance.  Patrice O'Neal was again mentioned as a later guest.

The next segment started with more Tiger Woods discussion and speculation on his career longevity, comparing him to golfing legends.  This transitioned into a lengthy segment about Jimmy "The Greek" Snyder's infamous racist comments, with the hosts mimicking his remarks. The hosts then discussed other offensive and racist statements from celebrities, including a shockingly racist ad for "Nigger Boy" steel wool.  A listener-submitted audio clip of a Mel Gibson rant was played, along with a remix.  The segment also touched upon celebrities' ability to navigate public life, a birthday shout-out to Jimmy, and discussions of *The Expendables*, *Rampage*, *Postal*, and other violent films.  Randy Couture and Terry Crews were mentioned as upcoming guests.

A segment focused on comedians began with discussion of Don Rickles at Reagan's inauguration and John Pinette's comedy.  The main focus, however, was an in-studio interview with Terry Crews.  The conversation covered his career from "Battle Dome" (including an alleged punch thrown at Scott Steiner), his film roles, and navigating racial expectations in Hollywood.  His physique was frequently commented on explicitly. He discussed  "Training Day" and "The Expendables," sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes.  Randy Couture then joined, demonstrating a chokehold and discussing MMA techniques. Mark Maron briefly joined, discussing his career and personal life.  Terry Crews' Old Spice commercials were also mentioned. The segment was highly informal, profane, and sexually suggestive.

The final segment focused on Dane Cook's career, speculating on the reasons for his popularity and the nature of criticism towards him.  The influence of Mark Maron was discussed, with the hosts jokingly referring to various comedians as "Mark Maron babies." Patrice O'Neal participated, sharing anecdotes about interviewing Cook.  A significant portion of the segment was devoted to a crude and explicit conversation about erectile dysfunction, Cialis, Viagra, and the hosts' and Jimmy's personal experiences with aging and sex. Jimmy's birthday was celebrated, and his upcoming appearances were discussed.

[00:06:00]  it was just an innocent little thing but the mets uh fans coming out of the woodwork yeah to beat the  shit out of me i went to yankee stadium for the first time the new stadium ah yes but i have not  been to the new city field yet i have been to city last year was the first year for both stadiums  i did not make it to a baseball game last year and uh man people just beat me up that i would go to  yankee stadium to check out the new stadium why it's a big thing to check out goddamn impressive  place i'll tell you yeah they did a number on that holy shit isn't that amazing i felt like because 
[00:06:30]  i haven't been to yankee stadium in many many years probably five or six years easy and i felt like  i was stepping into the future because if you don't go to a lot of baseball games for that  you know that long of a time or whatever then you go to the brand new yankee stadium like wow this is  the future and this is how they handle baseball now yeah yeah you know for the regulars that go to  baseball games year after year you don't really you just kind of go with the progress you know what 
[00:07:00]  i mean but if all of a sudden you just miss five years and then jump ahead and go to a game  you realize wow they're doing some crazy shit at these baseball games that's why i always laugh  uh when someone will be like you know the old stadiums are great this corporate stadium thing  man it's just you know what it's the future it's just good yeah it's good there there are all kinds  of things to do in in the place well i was telling you before the show i now understand why baseball 
[00:07:30]  games are four or five hours long yeah they want you to be there for the entire day yeah sure you  know when they say a day at the ballpark they truly mean now an entire day at the ballpark yep at one  point i said hey i want to check out this stadium so we did a whole loop because i want to just see  everything i missed three outs by the time i got back to my seats doing a full fucking circle and a lot  of other people were doing a full circle so you know it's it's slow moving i i missed three lousy outs 
[00:08:00]  and i checked out the meat man i checked out all the food i checked out uh well i didn't check out  the museum they have a museum yeah but the line for the museum was too long and i'm looking at these  people isn't there a baseball game going on why are you online for a museum but you could do that  steakhouse and right yeah you have restaurants mohegan sun in the outfield you got you got uh you got  you could just hang out outside and have a beer somewhere and watch the game i think there was a  water slide i passed i'm not sure i haven't been to uh city field yet either uh home of the mets 
[00:08:30]  well i got to get to city field immediately i hear city field is more manageable that's that that's  what uh mets uh fans are calling it more manageable like uh yeah like yankee stadium is way over the top  compared to city there's a lot of shit yeah they kept it just baseball uh i don't know i haven't been  there yeah i'll have a full report because i'll get my ass over there within the next week or two  because now i gotta check out uh city field as well you mean the one the game that shouldn't have 
[00:09:00]  won mets the what happened the one the game where they shouldn't have won mets they uh it was a bad  call at the plate oh the giants yeah yeah it is my giants got screwed by the mets giants uh clearly won  over the mets yesterday uh dave in pennsylvania i did i did not know this uh dave what's up hey guys  hey you did see that game yesterday op i did not no i i'm not i saw the clip i don't watch a lot of  baseball games anymore i i can't uh make believe i do so yeah what happened there dave it was three to 
[00:09:30]  one mets were leading going into the bottom of the ninth uh giants come to bat and i'm getting two  runners on got a base hit to score the two runs tied it three three there was a runner on third for  the giants um one out uh there was a infield hit and they the third baseman hit through the ball to  the home plate and it was a real high throw the uh runner got under the tag just touched home plate 
[00:10:00]  then the catcher touched uh the runner there and the empire called him safe  or i'm sorry called called him out yeah called him out but uh he was clearly safe they showed it  over and over that was it so they went into extra innings and uh the mets wound up scoring and they  they won the game they it was such a bad call it's a it's it's a weird so many bad calls in the ninth  and the tenth inning between the pitches and just umpires just suck man why can't they go to instant 
[00:10:30]  replay for that i love this it's like wow quite the call this guy would make a great announcer no kidding  they're goofing on you sir it's yeah it's it's it's been a weird year for baseball i think they  bring uh the instant replay in next year because a lot of a lot of shit's going wrong this year  dude they are so fucking against true the instant replay that is true look at this look at this  the high throw oh my god he was so safe he's safe the ump was in a in in a bad position the slow 
[00:11:00]  mo uh you don't even need it i know you don't even really need the slow motion but oh it's not even  close he his leg was so far across home oh here you go here's a better shot at for who gives a  game oh that was closer than i thought you know though he's safe yeah but that was closer than i  thought from that angle oh here's uh oh no he's so safe it looked like his bent leg was the one that  touched uh the plate but it was his straight leg uh that touched the plate first so yeah wow 
[00:11:30]  fucking uh this guy wants to tell it correctly angelo from staten island what's up boys hey we  just saw the replay so i don't know if we even need you but what do you want to add the umpire is a  retard that's the same retarded umpire that when the met yankees were playing minnesota and it hit the  guy in the foot and it was totally foul that he called it a fair ball that's the shame umpire  number one number two the the call last night he even admitted after the game that he thought his 
[00:12:00]  foot was over the base but didn't touch home plate oh okay so it swept it was over it he said it did  not touch it that's why he was out oh that's crazy it didn't even look like the catch made the tag  either it looks like he came right behind his back it's pretty amazing came behind his back  this is too early for that man how great we go to mlb.com and we just saw 10 different angles of 
[00:12:30]  that one lousy play i know one lousy fucking play there future it is the future but love the intro tubes  but very impressed with yankee stadium not impressed with the 15 steak sandwich that we bought by the way  they have a they have a steak sandwich over there i i tweet it's got to pay the a-rod salary  well i don't i tweeted a picture of meat man yeah and then they carve up this meat nice and then uh  and then i i guess it's a 15 fucking sandwich it was good it wasn't worth 15 fucking dollars got  any bourbon in it or nothing then nothing and then what's up with the seats of yankee stadium you 
[00:13:00]  know about them in the front to like 1500 a seat or something like that but uh but you get  everything they just take care of you the whole game oh the wait staff and everything yeah yeah  but it comes with the price of your ticket they're great and then uh the seats are pretty pretty thin  because they just can't get that section sold out every game yeah so when you're watching the games  on tv it looks like no one's at the fucking with the economy the way it is you know toward the end of 
[00:13:30]  the season especially if the yankees are doing good you'll see that yeah but it is amazing that you  just sit there and you don't got to get up right you do not have to fucking get up they come by  whatever you want place your order and and you get it but the only thing you have to do at that point  is tip because everything comes with the the price yeah yeah yeah then i also learned they have five  dollar seats at yankee stadium five dollar seat for certain games and you can say weigh the fuck up  and then check out a game for five dollars just be there be there to experience the magic that's 
[00:14:00]  really uh really nice of them yeah that is nice of them to shove you in the cosmos for five dollars  there are seats at the park that just aren't worth like just watch it at home but i was just watch it  at home but who gets to to sit way high up in the sky i was thinking if you're not a huge fan yeah that  that would be a cool experience to go check out a five dollar seat and just look at the cosmos for  yeah just sit there and look up this is great i'm high realize how small they look down below on 
[00:14:30]  the field it would be a good experience no we could spit on people and just go haha suckers better  luck next time it's really nice of the yankees to offer you know five dollar seats to the real fans  and then you get in the place and of course you know after parking getting a couple waters how much  five dollar seat cost you exactly and that's why they do it they're not stupid yeah they got they  got you in the place and now you got all this stuff to check out for four or five hours a couple of 
[00:15:00]  fifteen dollar sandwiches exactly yeah five bucks i guarantee the average five dollar seat ends up  costing you easily 50 bucks hell yeah by the time it's all said and done uh let's go to mj in  mj good morning boy hey yo the new stadium was awesome man awesome steak houses all crazy stuff  but something so simple like basket robin's the line's a half mile long i ended up missing a  yankees rally and he ride homer because i'm staying alive for a fucking sunday yeah that that was a 
[00:15:30]  little weird because it seemed like they had a lot of places to eat but there were a lot of long lines  a lot of fucking people and especially the ice cream line because you know what was it a hundred  degrees yesterday something like that people want their ice cream i saw these people they they were  just in line forever yeah you're right mj check out uh george's box this weekend uh i don't have  that set up i'm sorry george's box and right in front of yankee stadium they had the the lamest memorial 
[00:16:00]  to bob shepherd i've ever seen the guy gave his life and you know how when like lady died died or  something or some fucking famous person they'd throw down the candles and the flowers and the  pictures giant and some dude threw his yankee cap down that obviously was a lame ass fucking  promotional yankee cap it wasn't even one of the good ones it's just sitting there and everyone's  taking pictures of this thing yeah it was the i should have fucking that was in a picture it was 
[00:16:30]  so lame right in front of you know yankee stadium that's remembering bob shepherd their pa announcer for i  don't know 85 years whatever he did no one cares about because george died george's box is unavailable  it's six feet underground oh yeah i can't see the game from there that's uh danny they're very good  you get a comfy satin pillow uh let's go to derek our intern in staten island derek hey what's up boys  um you know those people talking about those those presidential seats the ones that all the way 
[00:17:00]  about a front yeah what are they called though i think they call them the presidential no i don't  think that's the name but there might be there might be city though i don't remember what the  yankee stadiums call them something with a probably like premier presidential yeah and i know towards  the end of the season the steinbrenner family and management they give the seats out to vips  just to fill them up so the um that section up so it doesn't look like it's so empty but the problem  is vips don't uh use their seats so they would have to give them to the you know the the regular  fucking fans if they want to the regular fans they look at us they look at the regular fans 
[00:17:30]  like we're peasants i don't know they offer five dollar seats for you guys they'd probably give them  to celebrities and stuff and go hey come on down we'd like to see your face back there you know  yeah but if your team i i mean the yankees aren't going to be out of it but if your team's out of it  why would you go to the ballpark late in the year to sit in those seats for a four thousand dollar  sandwich or that's true that's true uh let me say hi to tony in jersey tony  tony what's up hey buddy hey yeah so you know those seats that are down they changed it from 
[00:18:00]  last year they used to be called legend seats and they used to go from all the way from first  all over third baseline what they did was they broke it up now they have championship seats  and legend seats the legends go from the dugout to dugout including home plate they range from  900 to 1100 dollars per seat jesus now you get a the only i believe it's either four or five diamond  restaurant of any ballpark in the country big deal uh it does include all your food and your soft drinks 
[00:18:30]  including water but not alcohol so you still have to pay fifteen dollars a beer wait so they can't  throw the alcohol in oh that's ridiculous probably some kind of law yeah oh you think it's a law that  they can't give away but if you're paying eleven hundred dollars per seat yeah you would think it's  included you can't drink eleven hundred dollars worth of alcohol in one game no and so the seats  right next to the giuliani seats they're eleven hundred bucks right and actually they go up in 
[00:19:00]  price depending on your row so like if you were sitting let's say right by uh to share you know  down the first baseline championship seats yeah the first row is 550 dollars the second row is 350  dollars why because you're in the first row man that's a yankee point even second row is in the  front row second row is just as good yeah in that situation sorry i didn't mean to run kenny's in 
[00:19:30]  no it's all right no but here's what really is annoying if you're in the old stadium and a lot of the  court parks before the game batting practice you can go down hang out by the dugout you know kids  can try to like you know maybe see one of the stars maybe get an autograph or something but at least  be part of the experience now in yankee stadium if you don't have legend seats you cannot go down for  batting practice oh man that used to be the coolest thing when when i was growing up we couldn't afford 
[00:20:00]  the good seats but we we went early to the game down batting practice down to batting practice to  check out everyone close up yeah they will not let anybody in that section if you do not pay  between 920 hours a seat you know that's that's just a sorry that's just a bad design for the stadium  they should have figured that out yeah because the batting the batting practice thing was always a  tradition uh for for kids you know run down there and check shit out for the kids for the kids maybe  get an autograph maybe one of these stars will will uh we'll give you a look well i'll tell you 
[00:20:30]  another secret i mean that's not a secret but something you could you know i've been doing  is stop up they're like they're you know reseller of uh sure yeah yeah stop up what the yankees have  been doing is for the seats that haven't been purchased they put them up on stop up and they pure  their pricing meaning that they'll start offering let's say you know a seat right behind all plate  for 1100 dollars at face value and it gets closer to the game they come down so depending on the game 
[00:21:00]  you could actually buy one of the seats for like three four hundred dollars right on i'd sell my  fucking legend seats because of you you cunt  mel's packing up and leaving that's the latest that's a rumor oh really it's a rumor thanks for  the call brother i appreciate it you know i can't trash yankee stadium i was i was blown away how 
[00:21:30]  nice that fucking place is hey i'm not going to become a yankee fan or anything like that but  wow that that's a hell of a ballpark man they really they uh really did a great job yeah and could  the police and you know we're big fans of the police maybe and it's not going to agree with me  but stop busting the guy selling water going into the stadium oh poor fucking guy is selling  water for a dollar a bottle and and you got guys writing them up just leave them alone i hate 
[00:22:00]  those guys that sell water on the side of the road it's it's nice when you get off the  fucking subway and you're fucking dying and take the d train uptown at d train because their hands  are wet and then they you know they're dirty and then and then the the water from the condensation  drifts and hits the cap and even though it's sealed it's like you take the cap off and now  his filthy hand water there's still some shit going on there you take the cap off and then you wipe it  on your shirt a little bit do a little fucking ring around the fucking lid and start drinking maybe 
[00:22:30]  for dust that's good but i'll tell you if uh for that disgusting hand i actually shit i actually felt  bad for these guys they were getting written up and i'm thinking if you're if you find yourself in  a position where you're selling water for a dollar a bottle and it's a hundred degrees out and you only  have i don't know maybe like 24 bottles because you can't carry anymore so i'm thinking they're only 
[00:23:00]  taking in 24 lousy dollars they had to pay for the water whatever their whatever their cost was  it's like why don't you leave these poor guys alone small profit margin who are they really hurting in  the end poor fucks i think it's a bigger conspiracy i think it's a a big you think it's one main guy i  think it's a main guy and he comes by and keeps delivering more water to those guys motherfucker  that's not a they're just the dealers yeah yeah and then you have to go up and there's some big  water kingpin somewhere who's supplying this i actually saw face i actually just drinking right 
[00:23:30]  out of a five gallon uh jug i was too lazy yesterday i should have taken more pictures because i actually  saw the kingpin of water i know you're joking about it but this guy had so much fucking water around  him i'm like how did you get all this water on the sidewalk just piles and piles and then as you  got close to the stadium it was the the little guy with like you know yeah 12 bottles here 20 bottles  over here one guy had just a little coleman cooler he was selling water out of never fuck me with my 
[00:24:00]  water tony never fuck me take it to the limit limit this is water being poured tony montana in the  montage is just drinking water yeah they're talking about water laughing at each other with  giant jugs of water close up of like hands putting ice into a glass there's just somebody just going  through the machine but it's only like eight bucks right it's one out dollar bills yeah just a few 
[00:24:30]  they're back they're back stroking in the water trucks leaving bj's wholesale club  stacks of water man but i was thinking too you know what fuck those guys you know what i'm with  the nypd after i'll fuck those guys because if they're selling the water for a dollar they had a  they had to have stolen it from somewhere you have to think the profit margin because i'm looking like  only a dollar for a big fucking water as you're walking into the stadium that's a that's a bargain 
[00:25:00]  of course that fell off the truck somewhere you think yeah it is some kind of illegal something  illegal thing went on there the water kingpin i like that i did i think i saw that guy though  and a few of the locals because i wasn't brave enough to make uh comments they're like it or a  few of the locals like you think you have enough water think you got enough water the fuck is that  about and i just walked by just leave the water guy alone don't look at anybody just just focus on  the stadium you'll get there you'll get there in one piece now the margin is better than you think 
[00:25:30]  because you can get a case of water for nine bucks okay okay and it's 30 and 35 to a case so that's  35 so then nine dollars let's call it so you're a 26 profit per case per case three cases but what  about the guy that only had like fucking 24 and he gets asked out that was a sad fucking sight and is  it poland spring or they sell that aquarius shit smell water i do notice that today there is the  poland spring is bountiful yeah in studio making a big comeback right here we appreciate that 
[00:26:00]  aquarius water indeed and then uh and then i finally gave in because then i had to take the d train back  downtown me and me doing subways and you know of course it's easiest way to actually to get there  and i finally broke down i grabbed one of the waters from one of these guys right you know at the top of  the subway and i get lukewarm water guy i'm like fuck i passed a hundred of these guys where you  see the ice just dripping off the fucking water and i get the nervous guy at the top of the subway

[00:51:30]  amazing did you get all the when you when you're daydreaming like that do you get like every detail's  gotta be right every how much i pay i'm paid automatically yeah a good 50 mil bam off the  back i what i do is i fucking buy uh i buy a nice car really fucking really nice car drive go get my  mom's out of boston yeah go to her job tell her who you want to smack who do you want to smack

[00:56:30]  live for a long long fucking time that's what made me not believe in karma by the way is just so many  kids just fucked over yeah and just rich people get to relax and that's why i go karma can't be real  you know you know i was watching last night uh a special on um or a biography uh they actually  did an interview this profiler sat down and did an interview with joel rifkin remember joel rifkin  sure do he was the guy from um was it elmont or uh long island right camera guy i think elmont 
[00:57:00]  somewhere around there a long island and he would kill prostitutes oh killed like 20 of them and uh  you know what the way you were saying that sounded like he was a good guy like i didn't know who he  was it's like okay who's this guy gentleman this uh man was you know what he didn't have a third  name that's what threw me off yeah joel fucking joel rifkin joel jewie rifkin and uh like they  showed the older pictures of him when when he uh was was doing the murders and and then they had 
[00:57:30]  him now sitting there he's just like an old guy really sitting there well he's getting old  and uh yeah in jail and then they're asking him you know what do you do he goes well i do this i do  that he's in jail enjoying his life in jail no one fucks with him because he's old well we talk about  it it becomes your life like you think about these guys don't really suffer in jail it just becomes  their life when you haven't been in jail or you've been in jail for a short period of time  you don't understand i guess the mindset of being in there for let's say 25 years after five six 
[00:58:00]  years you're probably going this is my life you do not it does not rehabilitate you just makes you  fucking it's like it just becomes what it is after after this first second of going all right i'm not  gonna get stabbed to death or raped yeah yeah uh but then you have people going i'd rather see him  in prison rot rotting and it's like you know what many of these guys rot in prison he's got a job 
[00:58:30]  if you're fucking talking made friends he's doing things it's fucking prison you're stuck in one  place a really nice tv too where you can see the tubes well if you're able to put the glass on there  so you can't hide if you're able to watch lebron james's announcement you're not suffering in jail  no you're not suffering if you're able to watch whatever the fuck's going on in the world on tv  how are you suffering and that's why i am all for the death penalty because you know but it caused  more people and and it's like oh that's a weird thing man i'm not for the death penalty i love the 
[00:59:00]  death penalty not because i don't want to see a motherfucker dies who might deserve it it's just  the fact of so i kill somebody now who's killing me like the state the state and the state is a  it's a bunch of people that i just don't want people doing shit to me because we've agreed that  you're a big fan of it huge oh yeah you get you you you huge fucking read some stories about  first degree murder and and uh child murders and shit like that and you know the guy did it it's 
[00:59:30]  not even a question of fucking circumstantial evidence it's like why the fuck i think you  should be an official atheist by the way if yeah you can't you can't have any god in your life  if you're going to be what about you have to you have to not believe in god about a power  some type of cosmic gelatin power thing that you believe you can't have any spirituality  no i'm not and and fucking be a part of the i think you can you can't have a good bad god 
[01:00:00]  you can't have a you're good you're gonna you know go to good place you're bad you're gonna go to bad  place god but you could have something like uh there was this big fucking cosmic cloud that in  that made everything and made life and shit i do apologize i i will say this uh those goddamn  muslims supposedly believe in god and their death penalties are the least god maybe they're closer  to the bible than uh maybe they're wait i'll take that back because i'm stoning a bitch that's buried  up to her neck it's close to bible right how do you protect yourself if you're buried up to your neck 
[01:00:30]  and people are throwing rocks at you that sucks man stoning a bitch buried up to her fucking neck  the best thing to do is blink your eyes and hope that protects you you just see that rock come flying  towards your face and you can't you do nothing but blink right when you you shell your eyes tight  and wrinkle your nose and they probably wouldn't even allow you to do that they probably make make  sure your eyes are wide open so you can really see the rock nail you in the head and you couldn't 
[01:01:00]  even shrug your shoulders like you're just stuck you're trying to fucking you've never seen how  important lips are until somebody's trying to stone you bury up to your fucking try to push your cheek  forward a little bit as just as your sentence yeah yeah yeah like that you know i guess you look i  believe in you know what i like that shit too i like that shit too why not some fucking child  but it's so many it's so many mistakes it's so many death penalty mistakes man it's just like don't 
[01:01:30]  they find out a lot look at in detroit at some point they had to just they had to let everybody  off death row because it was so many people that were not supposed to be there after corruption and  all that shit they like we got to let everybody off because no one no one's supposed to be here so we  just stopped it for right from right now yeah no death penalty yet i think it was detroit because  it because he um it was so corrupt so that's what i'm saying it's so final a lot of people might not 
[01:02:00]  have deserved i mean the gary gilway or gilmore whatever there's some guys if they did what they  did yeah yeah yeah you can i'm not against it on a level like oh poor guy i'm i'm against it that  it might be some innocence and who's killing you if god was like boom no problem that's why the appeals  last so fucking long though to make sure like you know you're not killing some guy that didn't do  the shit and then you got guards doing the shit you got regular people oh shit uh hold on yeah we 
[01:02:30]  got a guy that actually has two family members doing life and uh very pissed off at us uh renee  hey what's going on freaking nancy grace and james lady mitchell over there all right shut up girl name  shut up girl name renee your fucking girl name wait a minute wait wait let me find out for a second  hold on hold on so renee are we all wrong or or just these two well obviously no actually i think

[01:04:00]  that call this one oh okay i know why that's yeah yeah really yeah i don't want that wrecked yeah  that's true you know you're right and that's you know what's gonna happen you're absolutely right  we're worried before renee scare the shit out of us  i mean it's just look i'm not against i'm not against that shit on a on a oh all right how about  this punishment level anthony in new york he knows a little something about uh charles manson how do 
[01:04:30]  you know something about charles manson all right well first off they were so guys first off i got a  good friend who was uh who was in the military who did a tour in iraq in 2003 so when uh he got back  he told me well as everybody knows charles manson you know he's he's still alive he uh avoided the uh  uh the death penalty and uh you know i forget it and like the 70s or something because it was a  certain clause it was a rule in california yeah we know they repealed the death penalty 
[01:05:00]  okay continue we're gonna kill him and then yeah yeah he got lucky here's the deal  no y'all think this is crazy this is true though right before we went to iraq in 2003  they came to him the cia has started like um uh operation and they wanted to use use him in iraq he  had the opportunity to be free and they came to him and said you know here's what we want you to do 
[01:05:30]  we want you to go to iraq and act as one of them and you know i guess have him dress up in the  clothes or whatever and act as like an ambassador and try and get uh out out who's saying and they  wanted to use him to talk to the people because you know he's a very smart man he's got a crazy  high iq and he speaks he speaks a lot of languages they wanted to use did you get did you get that  baby carry thing as a gift or did you have to buy it did you get it as a gift or have to buy it 
[01:06:00]  a guy that has a gift with his swastika cut his head they wanted to use him over there  they are yeah because because he's stable and he would do exactly what the government wants of him  gotta turn off that awful music and play hell to see hell to  operation that was starting  do we just hang up on what do we do are you out of your fucking mind  wait a minute but listen you know i'm a conspiracy theorist it's very interesting 
[01:06:30]  that he's saying this i mean it's possible but there's a lot of  i mean what is he goes over there and they tell him to pretend he's an arab with that with that  fucking voice he got what what they wanted to pretend he was an arab and they wanted to  to speak to all the arab people in his language and give them to move or travel or  i'm gonna i'm gonna be i'm gonna be honest man guys with this accent never i never seem to think  they're crazy a covert plane i promise i swear to god i don't know if it's on on documents because 
[01:07:00]  the whole thing was scrapped but i got a good friend in the military he's a he's a he's not a  conspiracy theorist but he's got a good friend he said that would come out this is the reason  this is the reason i i fucking believe it this is the reason i don't i don't believe in uh i don't  believe in ufos yeah i i don't believe in anything like uh i believe in government shit to a to a to  a degree to a large degree but a lot of a lot of this shit you can't hide like you hear he's saying 
[01:07:30]  a friend of mine said this said charles man the charles manson play now that's a low level conspiracy  thing is charles man so at this point this is why you know i i have i'm having trouble with jfk and a  lot of that stuff because if somebody is is gonna say something no one can keep alien secret no one  can even keep operation fucking charlie manson by the operation charlie manson operation charlie  manson has to be the dumbest fucking thing no no no anthony hold on a second you're there yeah yeah 
[01:08:00]  all right hold on david in oklahoma wants in on this one david yeah i think that guy's been listening  to alex jones a little too much i mean that's the dumbest fucking thing i've ever heard  yeah on the thing but guess what but guess what it is this is the type of stuff that people like  you say it's the dumbest thing i've ever heard which is why they do shit and get away with it  because regular people like you think uh nah it won't happen it won't happen it won't happen  who's your buddy in the army is he's some low-level private that thinks he knows everything he's got 
[01:08:30]  an inside scoop on nothing no no he's dropping people like you every day no is your buddy the  chef at some barracks in the middle of the desert is that where you're getting this info from i mean  that'll go get some stuff shut the fuck up you know what though is there is there any is there  any place you can send anybody that has this anywhere that that's the thing when you say my  buddy told me that's where it gets fucked up but you got to have a place to like alex jones man he'll 
[01:09:00]  they always have a place to send you you know the guys the guys that by the way the guys that have  the guys you got two guys arguing on the phone i'll fade them down a minute the guys that have that  info aren't going to tell their buddies no that's that's how the cia works they don't they don't have  fucking guys that's going oh my god i gotta tell my buddies back home hey who is your buddy yeah who's  your buddy and trust me man who's your buddy would you listen to me for a second who's your buddy what 
[01:09:30]  does he do what's your buddy's hey hey dude dude hey hey anthony what does your buddy do like what  what uh line of the military is he in that he even was privy to this information he uh schemes on  people's uh he pulls up ip addresses on regular people like you and me he listens to our conversations  he uh if he gets a flag like if you're touching a buddy i had a i had a fucking buddy that told me 
[01:10:00]  that man this is hey listen people listen to you so they listen to me uh what during my phone calls  and shit i mean not you know it's just every it's operation big brother you want to do that right  they do listen to you call it for buzzwords like fuck the president and i'm gonna blow up this and  i read about big brother in 1984 that's like 1984 all over again yeah yeah all right david thank you  let me go to uh  shit hold on man sorry about that let me go to cassius in brooklyn cassius you're on with anthony in new york 
[01:10:30]  oh thank god yeah he's he's so uh so brilliant uh this is it's just such a most ridiculous story uh  manson is not multilingual he doesn't he doesn't know anything other than english  how do you know how do you know and he's world like people know what he looks like  prove it but yeah he's got a swastika carved into his forehead he sends a guy like that to do  diplomatic work or this is so asinine so fucking he's very asinine which is why they do something 
[01:11:00]  like that expect people like you not to believe it come on imagine if that ever got out like that  the president was using charles manson was behind charles manson a bunch of arabs around a campfire  you know what cassius he makes a good point what he got on that jeez oh yeah yeah it's such a solid 
[01:11:30]  point yeah you can say this about anyone you could say they were trying to let anybody anybody out of  prison to to do something like this and then you just say you know it's it's because common people  like like us wouldn't believe it that that's why they would do it yeah so anything ridiculous is  viable because we wouldn't believe it is that it wait anthony's got a question go anthony 
[01:12:00]  you remember the ice man right the ice man the ice man from new jersey yeah yeah yeah  he killed over 100 people he killed him in all these sick ways he he uh he ice picked him stabbed  him he shot him all right whatever go forward yeah yeah you don't remember man do your mafia history  all right now why do you think he's still alive let me ask you that well good question okay he's got  you there cassius yeah what is this a person who's locked up currently yeah i mean he's locked up he he does 
[01:12:30]  a fucking uh interview on dateline every year it's like an anniversary thing and the media gets a  fucking kick off this guy man they get hard on off this dude because he's such a fucking genius  they won't kill him what is it there's all sorts of there's all sorts of criminals we have locked up  that aren't being killed what does that prove that proves nothing it proves a lot man you gotta wake up  all right right on cassius thank you wow you know thank you to cash but i'm telling you all right hold on  hold on anthony all right i'm trying to tell you all but i don't want to anthony shut the fuck up for a 
[01:13:00]  second shut up um shut up wait he might say something good here  y'all look crazy not to give that any kind of weight come on all right listen  a lot of people do though hold on anthony i'm trying to shut you up because i got a guy backing  you up we got dana in boston you're on with anthony new york boys good morning can you hear me yes i  got you dana but i want to let uh you guys know that uh my brother's in the air force yep and uh he 
[01:13:30]  heard that they're gonna hire jeffrey dahmer to go to area 51 and talk to the aliens fucking john  travolta sounding retard anthony comment he called you a john travolta sounding retard hey what was  his name dana dana hey dana hey fuck you ain't a booster red shots in your fucking bitch ass name  bitch ass nigga oh damn it's dana sick to be calling from boston i'm sorry about that patrice man you 
[01:14:00]  cool though but you know fuck dana well you didn't have to use the n-word well patrice isn't a bitch ass  yeah really he used it in the correct context there's a motion behind it you don't worry about  what are you gonna do uh anthony uh derek in alabama derek you're on with anthony in new york  hey yeah why would uh they send him over to iraq to listen to our phone calls can't they just do  that from here no they're doing that from here but yeah that the no he has a point though you can't  just dismiss him it's possible you can completely get the hell out of here maybe operation charles 
[01:14:30]  manson could be with someone else though yeah people say this a lot they say this a lot why are  you wasting regular lives when and and filling up these jails there's two million people in jail some  shit and it's like why not send a couple of them over and they might be looking into that giving these  guys choice they do it they do it on these shows where they give you but they give these kids a 
[01:15:00]  choice you go to jail for the rest of your life or you go to this boot camp i'm sure there's some  prisoners right they go okay we're gonna transfer you seen uh con air you go i'm gonna transfer these  sick motherfuckers to this prison we just built yeah all right don't have a family guys been in jail  10 years fucking no no visitors they go listen we got listen you could you could do this for us  go into this training this clockwork orange kind of shit and we're gonna send you over to iraq and do  some some clandestine work it's it's you can't dismiss you you can't just say fuck that because 
[01:15:30]  he's right the point is you can't just go man something i agree with the possibility of things  that happen that we don't believe that they can exist scandal it's funny that he says charles man  charles manson is just a funny guy to say but if he said this 70 years old you know right  swastika right he sits there and makes fucking that makes uh scorpions out of people's hair  charles manson could all right listen listen we got bonnie in dc i got two really good calls here 
[01:16:00]  first one is bonnie bonnie in dc go ahead hey how come when the other guy cash has called in and said  charles manson doesn't even speak a lot of english he's made a legitimate point and this other dude  anthony his answer was prove it and that was it well you prove something you see what i'm saying  yeah yeah it is anthony you don't have any you're not you know it's hard to say i mean i've heard  some things that make sense a friend of mine told me why they have you been down when planes crash and 
[01:16:30]  put your head between your knees yeah yeah it's so your neck cracks so you won't suffer you know it  makes sense but he's like hey i got some information i'm like well where you get that from because your  friend told you it's it's gospel right it's hard the only reason why i'd have the balls to call up  and even like and and and and common all that to say that is because well it's my buddy who works in  the military he does the whole uh you know the whole eavesdropping thing like the whole like i'll 
[01:17:00]  put it like this so he heard man the military picked the wrong guy to tell everybody that he's  the eavesdropping girl you hear what happened right yeah no i'm just gonna make a quick point  and and then i'll punch out though hold on you can't hold on hold on hold on before you make your  quick point uh sea wedge in massachusetts and then we'll end with you making your point go ahead sea  wedge hey what's up guys hey hey um yeah i met i met this whole child mantha thing actually uh was  gonna happen and it went down like it did on team america where they you know stuck shit on his face 
[01:17:30]  and uh you know dirk dirk and muhammad jihad it happens just like that yeah a lot of people  commenting that this sounds a lot like team america yeah team america yeah very good sea wedge  all right your point anthony uh i'll put it like this but this guy and the only reason why i would  think it's credible is because what this guy does he does intel like i can't say everything what he  what you know he does oh sure this is so dangerous though to just to do what you're doing though 
[01:18:00]  man i think you should stop because at some point somebody's gonna look for you and say who's  this who's your friend oh they're already looking for me i'm ready i'm ready i got a whole babble of  guns i'll be ready to go to the mountains if the shit pops off oh i'll pay tabernod because i know  they're looking for me they're gonna get me though i know i'm not and and you're not and you all of  this and you you pay 14.95 a month for serious rate like you you're fucking you have enough collected  that make you you just listen to morning radio every morning just to chill out guns ready to die 
[01:18:30]  and fucking serious xm motherfucker that's your new that's the new commercial i'm ready to die  and serious xm well the while the government's burning down your house you'll have classic  rewind at least to listen to i'm saying i'm just look at charles manson is what fucked him up but  if he had to say there's opera i can see it's possible to me i mean he believes this shit  to us every day what we don't think it all these high tech phones our iphones four and all this  stuff if you punch in the right word if you punch in the right word it doesn't mean it doesn't matter 
[01:19:00]  if you're on your internet it doesn't matter if you're on your cell phone yeah if you're punching  a keyword a flag comes up and what they do is it doesn't matter what base or where they at but  your ip address comes up and they pull your ip address on your phone or your internet so you don't  sound crazy to me anthony i got i got i got my iphone up right now okay right but the people  that want to do harm to us hold on the people that want to do harm to us will speak in code they  wouldn't just fucking uh make it that blatant yeah they would they would i don't fucking know they 
[01:19:30]  wouldn't yes they would okay if you if you text a friend i can't stand obama okay that's one thing  if you text a friend i can't stand obama i hope he gets blown up in his meeting uh at massachusetts  as soon as he lands at the airport but that's but you just said that i just dude you just i  believe it i just hold on all right i know what he's gonna say listen to this you just said it 
[01:20:00]  so now you just said it you're flagged right you're you just flagged yourself all right you just  said it they got your ip right now they got your shit yeah yeah they got me he just ruined his  yeah but he's not worried about it he's ready to kill everybody that's true as he listens to  fucking asia jesus christ man that guy is batshit crazy batshit crazy with this fucking i don't think  so come on yeah but a batshit crazy guy explaining to me why bread is bad like a homeless guy's just 
[01:20:30]  screaming why bread is bad and i go this is this makes a lot of sense or a crazy man i've heard the  only person i've ever heard to make space travel make sense like the the how do how do you space  travel quickly you know what's the science of it it is what's crazy people it's not like like dr  cock who when he called he's a nut like he's not a a regular dude man he's insane but it's not saying 
[01:21:00]  his friend like his whole story do you think a guy charles manson's kind of you know  intelligence there's a swastik in the middle of his forehead i know but operation charles manson this  could be i'm just saying kind of without him hold on some young fucking let anthony wrap this thing  do you think this fucking guy has a friend in intelligence that knows now he knows him well  enough because he's his friend he's like hey my buddy anthony you know the loud mouth motherfucker 
[01:21:30]  anthony that babbles all kinds of shit i'm in military intelligence to the point where i know  all kinds of shit that they're doing let me tell my dopey friend anthony that fucking blabs it out  i absolutely agree with you okay and here's here's the thing i'll add i think a friend told me when  you're dealing with a guy like this yeah is that his friend is him and i think he might be if he's  if he's fucking has the tyler dirt and shit yeah if he has the ideas i mean if he's saying that he 
[01:22:00]  has guns and he's waiting for this shit he's you know he might be listening to certain things and  then you elaborate because i i you know you you when you're crazy you do crazy things sometimes i  catch myself daydreaming like we were talking about yeah about things and it becomes very real  a daydream and you make it make sense and you make it fucking yeah yeah i think he doesn't have a  friend and and you know and i think that uh you know let me uh he made it up guys that entire time 
[01:22:30]  uh renee called back from new mexico oh renee hopefully having him on hold for 20 minutes  calmed him down a little bit yeah what happened renee renee hey what's going on now let's talk  about this uh man to man okay listen you you have hold on hold on hold on because people are just  turning in you have two family members that are doing life in prison and you got hold on i'm just  setting up hold on i'm setting up the whole thing for you renee and then you can talk as long as you  want uh and we have said many times in the show and it's not just us saying it we've actually  talked to guys that have been in the joint for a very long time we have we have a we have a nice 
[01:23:00]  fan base with guys that are in jail or have done many many years and they agree with us they said  after a while jail just becomes your life and you're not really suffering as much as the average person  would think well most of your callers agree with everything you guys say so that really doesn't mean  anything all right all right fair enough fair enough i've got a cousin doing 25 to life he  deserves it and i got a nephew doing 40 to life he deserves it yeah i got another nephew's getting 
[01:23:30]  out in a couple weeks and he just took a some kind of ice pick to the ear and he's got a fucking family  you got there now yeah they're nuts but anyway that's another point and uh and they call me or i go  see him or write to him here and there i don't go see him all the time because they're you know california  now but they're miserable man they're like sad run down depressing people i'm not saying it's a  great place i'm just saying it becomes your life no one's rotting away in prison like the family of 
[01:24:00]  the victim likes uh uh to think someone's rotting away in prison they're living their life that you  adapt to this this situation and live fight every day almost to freaking get to your day and watch  you don't gotta fight every day and i you know what it's mundane it's fucking routine it's like  everyone that gets up for this stupid job every morning and then comes home to a naggy wife or  whatever the fuck it is it's just another mundane routine life that these guys live yeah we're not 
[01:24:30]  saying that it's the most exciting thing no but they're eating they're fucking yeah just like in  society they're a bad motherfuckers that can fuck you up so so you don't want to eat anthony is that  your deal no i didn't say i didn't say that at all the drug users i just said violent criminals that  perpetrate horrid crimes against humanity do not deserve to live in a place that is adaptable that 
[01:25:00]  they can then adapt to they need uh horrid places they need places where they they have to work too  much where they have where they suffer every day and and have to really think about what they did  every day i will say though thinking back to what we were saying i think we were uh approaching it  with um we were approaching it with free man's tongues like yeah i think what you're doing right now 
[01:25:30]  is it makes sense to to explain it wasn't the context wasn't man fuck prison is just simple  prison we're not saying it's just as as you you after five or six years the point being it stops being  what you don't live like the suffering of a man in prison after five years you're living years you're  not the guy on day one when that fucking and it's not saying that that is happiness it's just a an  an adept an adept you adapt you're not horrified like you were on day one we've adapted to our

[01:29:00]  savage family how many listeners of this show do you think don't like the show oh a lot but listen  how many people work here don't like the show he doesn't like you he went to some other shit  there's a weird group you bug him there's patrice i'll ask you a question there's a weird group of  uh fans i'll put in quotes that just want to hate they listen to hate that guy's in a whole  other category though i wish i knew what he was saying but i couldn't let him get a word in i had 
[01:29:30]  to talk about horrible shit could someone go listen to the phone call because i think he probably said  some horrible things what was he trying to say to me some about i know you live and and oh was it  i've been there already listen i was at your party i was at your party can we can we some name can we  summarize i mean obviously not everyone doing hard time in prison is yeah they're miserable they're  fucking it's a nightmare just get the context is what but the context it's been our experience with 
[01:30:00]  this dumb show talking to you know guys that have been in and out of jail it's like the majority of  people it becomes your life and what you're not completely suffering you'd rather be out on the  outside i'm sure but it becomes your thing and because this dumb family got caught and sent to  prison uh uh that big the that i'm friends with cops and have them on my house for a party is a  problem with renee what the fuck was that but some people who aren't squares too like 
[01:30:30]  jail comes with the territory and it's like you know they're they're not afraid of that's why you go  back in and out it's like i'm i'm once you're a person on the street you get caught what are you  going to be when you come out you're not what are you going to make ten thousand a year what are you  going to make thirty thousand a year a a regular guy who's a plumber i guess plumbers make sixty  maybe you know i mean it's like he's used to that he knows how to live like that he's going to live  like that for his whole life but a guy who does crime and then you go to jail you're not a jail is 
[01:31:00]  not a deterrent after you're there still somewhere else can i tag what i'm saying let me jump in here  because you make a great point and then on top of that you get out of jail and now it's on your  record so now you can't even get a legit you can't get a regular i'm thinking if you come out of jail  and you and you got a record now you should go to the top of the fucking list to be hired  as wow wait a minute because that's a fucking great point because as the the fact being you  they send you to jail to rehabilitate they say you are now okay to go back in society but you have 
[01:31:30]  nothing but the only option is i'm going to either work at mcdonald's but where you can lie about  working there like you can lie about your reference and lie about having a record yeah or i need to  survive you got to do some fucked up shit because any go and go back any legitimate job an employer  is not going to hire you if you have that on your fucking record so i'm thinking if you have that on  your record then that's the people you should be hiring because i think that's a fucking great  point man the streets a little safer that's better than i think that's that's higher than affirmative 
[01:32:00]  action really i'm telling you because a black person without a record okay can can has a better  chance than anybody coming out of jail and you and you're trying to do the right thing and you're  like look first you got a parole officer when you're a ward of the state i watch some of these  things where you go on parole if they gave me 10 years in prison okay i serve three and i do seven  years parole i'd rather do the whole 10 i know that sounds fucking crazy the whole 10 and not be a 
[01:32:30]  ward of the state wow because you it's it's like having it's like having a master the jail is already  in your life now they constantly are on you about going back and you got to report to this guy who  can say you know what i'm gonna fuck you on your shit on your piss test i'm gonna fuck you because you  were late reporting to me i'm gonna put you back in jail for another year then you get out and you still  got the whole six over your head you can't leave the state you can't do anything you can't get a 
[01:33:00]  job it's when you get out of jail and if they say that you are fucking good enough to leave jail  they should make people fucking hire you or only have the ability to have the law enforcement check  your record everybody else you're a fucking free guy you're a civilian because why wouldn't you go  back to doing street shit after you get out of jail there's no choice you don't have a choice  you want a murderer well i'm like working with your fucking obviously my theory has some fucking 
[01:33:30]  holes in it but i'm just saying it's not crazy but the state it's like look i'm not saying don't let  him out you're saying he's a part of society now right don't let him out yeah but you're part of  society with consequences based on your fucking directions but that's gonna that's gonna come  back to bite you because you went to jail was the fucking reason you went like you went the jail is  supposed to be there for your rehabilitation it's the purpose of going you commit murder i put you in 
[01:34:00]  this is why i always said one thing i don't agree with michael vick i'm a dog lover but the thing about  michael vick going to jail and all these apologies that he had to do yeah jail is here so you don't  ever have to say i'm sorry but there's there's there's shit that happens after you get out because  you were in what do you mean what if i joined the kkk and then i'm not in the kkk anymore should 
[01:34:30]  people just be like well he's out now no no no that's that's that the kkk isn't but it's a  repercussion based on what i did this is all quote end quotes okay the state is is saying to  to to the society we're taking him out of society this guy gets life with no parole we think what he  did was so fucked up he can't never he's not good enough to come back with us yeah the other guy is 
[01:35:00]  10 10 years 10 to 25 he gets out or 25 to life maybe 15 to life 15 years if we think at 15 years  if he's doing okay here we're gonna give him a chance to society okay he has another he now 10 to  like meaning i mean 25 he has the rest of his life to be awarded a state okay he has to be on a  straight and narrow he goes into a fucking job okay and he's and he has a skill like look i think you  if he has a wall street skill or if he has a fucking executive position skill get his motherfucking 
[01:35:30]  executive position job even though he fucking committed to murder only because the state now  your clan point don't make sense because you chose the clan then you chose leaving but the clan's not  the state but you chose the crime yeah but people make mistakes and you never made a mistake i made a  mistake by joining the clan what happened what big mistake you made in your life man anything  got married yeah but i mean okay but you got married all right now you got married and the 
[01:36:00]  the jill situation that's that's documented yeah right the next the next bitch coming around  every bitch from there on judges what you are by the fact that you had two failed relationships  well that's now they judge you immediately based on that that's true i mean it's it's like it's  unfair why is it unfair though tell you the truth yeah i i'll even be honest you lost your point 
[01:36:30]  it's unfair because you lost your point but if you could never i did it if you could never get  don't mean that's not the point doesn't mean i'll never do it again that's not the point the point is  those the new girls you never and this is hypothetical to the hypotheticalness you you can't  get another girl based on what you did with those other two relationships like the convict you would 
[01:37:00]  have to rebuild your trust and and and if you got to go out and work a shitty job and then uh  shitty job is fine by the way any shitty job is fine it's hard to get a shitty job and if you're a felon  you can't get a shitty where do you where do you go yeah you can rebuild your trust good point  but that's what i'm saying um but right now you don't you can you can get pussy tomorrow you can  fix cars over there at lunderguards fucking uh you can but go over to lunderguards and go hey 
[01:37:30]  fucking shep proudfoot we can continue this after the break  don't know i'm won't vouch for us that's a great at the fucking fargo why do i know fargo  analogies i love that fucking listen patrice o'neill is gonna be at the miami improv this  weekend friday saturday and sunday miami improv.com for tickets or follow uh patrice on twitter big  mama prods he'll tweet about his miami shows i'm sure we'll go to break with this and then you  know it's a radisson so it's pretty good yeah and then we'll do something else say the other guy 
[01:38:00]  you should say the other guy holy square you darn tootin that's a great movie ah what the christ  ah what the christ it's a comedy you're such a super lady coen brothers by the way best movie  makers i think yeah fucking great man i love coen's brothers movies yeah after it's just the tags  mill is crossing oh just the tags all right listen we'll play this and then eric's gonna play a  little something for anthony in new york and then we'll do something else and then we come back and 
[01:38:30]  we talk to patrice some more patrice rules opian anthony patrice o'neill we're talking a little  sports so anthony kind of faded away on us yeah i why are you a sports fan man i'm not basketball i  have no he hates basketball i have no clue about it i don't know i couldn't play it oh no i could never 
[01:39:00]  play it didn't have a jump shot never shot around anthony's logic on basketball isn't that bad  i just really isn't that bad i've watched the last couple of minutes of a basketball game and that's  pretty exciting and fun and shit but for the most part it's like dick dick dick dick dick score  dick dick dick dick dick score dick dick dick dick this good it's like you know something i can't get  into this and that's my and that's my thing on every sport that i don't like is i always ask i'll trash  your sport and i just go look somebody please explain to me why it's good this just just tell 
[01:39:30]  me the intricacies of it well one sport i did learn thing is hockey i did learn some things is i go oh  okay this is why they're stopping and doing this this is why they're fighting this is why this is why  uh the goalie's missing it's it's like oh okay i get it i get oh this is skill i see what a skillet  that's all i just want to know hockey let me know yeah yeah in my world hockey is is the sport to the 
[01:40:00]  point where i'm still following my shitty islanders they haven't done shit in over a decade and i'm  still can you just tell me why it's the hitting for me you just i love the hitting okay fair enough  more than anything in hockey i think football even better than uh i mean a good fight in hockey still  rules but in general i love some how about okay fucking hits okay take the hitting out because  hitting is is a almost a uh a dessert to the game what is the the thing where you if as a as a casual 
[01:40:30]  watcher i watch hockey other than the hitting because i see the hitting okay what is it that they're  doing that you go i should i should appreciate as a as a non-fan you know that's i mean that's a  really good question because where i'm at with hockey now i'm gonna sound kind of like hypocritical  i'm a little frustrated by the sport because i think the guys have gotten so big and so fast that  it looks just very crowded out there you know it can't they can't fucking fucking moves like like 
[01:41:00]  when there's stick handling oh yeah but a lot of times through two guys and the finesse around guys  yeah the skills are amazing but what frustrates me about hockey these days it they're just fighting  to get the puck for most of the fucking game and then finally they could get a play going but for  the most part they're just fighting to try but a real hockey a real a real hockey fan would even know  how to appreciate even what you're saying bores you they would know how to appreciate i'm not saying 
[01:41:30]  it bores me it frustrates me i i feel like that uh i feel like the nhl is gonna have to do something  eventually because they're just getting too damn good for so is but is this a basic hockey uh  thought that you have like it's a dumb it's a dumb hockey fans on on a regular agree with you what  you're saying now i don't know about that they would probably go go you know shut the fuck up you  don't know anything about sports like they usually do but uh i mean my my point with hockey i i feel  like if they made the rinks bigger it would be a much more exciting game give these guys a little 
[01:42:00]  room because like gans said their skills are ridiculous what they do the uh the football i  think is one of the most exciting sports ever because the scoring isn't that high for the most  part unless you get those blowout games and it's like every time the team has the ball that's  exciting it's like all right they're they're making a drive here they go you know and you get  a first down holy shit like there's exciting shit happening i think football is the number one able 
[01:42:30]  to explain why it's good to somebody who's not into it it's like what it's a it's 22 guys and you can  point at every one of them at every play and go watch watch 72 watch why he's good watch that block  i've seen plays where you go holy shit look at that block it wasn't a vicious it just was  the it perfect watch this guy move a guy with his left hand run over and and block another guy yeah 
[01:43:00]  holy now you can go and then you go watch the running back which you get the running back and  the quarterback and the what they call the skill positions you see speak for themselves yeah that's  all your most people that's all they're focusing on watch a really uh hardcore football  hell you go watch rape a girl watch him and watch his wife defend him god damn it if you're gonna  get married marry a black bitch man she she will fucking is that is that in your fucking corner man 
[01:43:30]  is that denial on her part no black bitches got your back they just got your back oh cheating  hearty har har fucking black bitch was with jesse james baby come on just don't make me look stupid  getting back to the hockey though the the goals and the saves are you know pretty fucking amazing  goals are self-explanatory i wish the scoring was a little higher in hockey it seems like uh it's a 
[01:44:00]  bit low for my taste i would like to see a few more goals and a few more fights to be honest with you i  love the fighting but still do you see how you're just not you're just not explaining it  well that's what i'm saying you didn't really explain football that yes i did yeah but i can  i'm saying if you sat and watch a football game with somebody don't like football you can show if  they still don't like football you go ah go fuck yourself you're not gonna go it's you it's not a  boutique sport man i actually explained how hockey could be a little better in my eyes that's all i'm 
[01:44:30]  saying but i mean the hitting when you see someone get fucking crushed into the boards that's exciting  but that's self-explanatory and then no and then if uh a team that hits very well will do  very well because it opens up some some room it opens up some plays up opens up some scoring  opportunities a home run i get it a big time shortstop a two seven twelve double play i don't know  what the fuck that's self-explanatory when you watch it how many home runs you see 
[01:45:00]  explain why sports center explain how baseball is a a great sport it stinks we've took we've took i hate  it but i'm saying a baseball did a better job defending hockey than than like you didn't do a  bad job i'm saying you you explain okay a home run a a a a uh a double play you see you you the  highlight parts well i was i see right right and you're in a selfish i'm saying nuance i was keeping  out the obvious when when you see a fucking goal a nine out of ten times it's like wow that was 
[01:45:30]  fucking cool like basketball look there is a skill because i i played obviously there's a skill to  having a ball in your hand and you're dribbling it and some other motherfuckers trying to take it  and you know how to move the ball with your hand it's it's an amazing skill to watch a motherfucker  dribble or watch a motherfucker with a a six foot ten guy in your face shoot up shoot this  fucking ball into a a hole yay big it's you see the all right you know it's just you can see it 
[01:46:00]  let me jump in on that one uh basketball by far was my number one sport okay i don't know they lost  me somewhere and i don't know i'll tell you where they lost you what you have to well we talked about  the neck tattoos more of it yeah you have to embrace you have to embrace that you're white  you don't embrace that you're white enough more as a joke we started saying when the tattoo started  you know raising above the neckline i i i tapped out but i don't agree man i don't be honest 
[01:46:30]  patrice i would be i don't know if it's that it's too niggery so it wasn't nick magic so who  magic who made it that iverson i don't want to blame iverson for niggery i don't i don't i don't  want to blame him but david stern had a dress code and in in implemented right yeah because i'm gonna  tell you steve nash still dresses like a homeless man dirk navinsky dresses like that dirty looking  that dirty uh pressed on their face wet gray hair greasy guys sicking me but it was made up for 
[01:47:00]  these gangsters and i think the the product is this not a lot of black people i love when they  show up at the fucking game it's a it's a white little kid white kids are there which is and when  you see this tatted up nigger trying to save the ball and he knocks your little white boy this white  kid's popcorn out of his hand and he's just got his nigger sweat on your white kid they're trying  let's be honest look you know what let's be fucking you know honest you know what this world is really 
[01:47:30]  fucked up because we don't even acknowledge it because i i get to a nick game and maybe a couple  times a year and you can't see a fucking black guy in the back there's some black fans but in the back  but it spike lee's there you know and you're trying to tell me if you go to madison square  garden to watch the next you would you would just assume that white people are the only ones that love  basketball uh and and it's and and and the nba doesn't even want to acknowledge that that's a  problem that their biggest fan base aren't even going to the games because they can't they probably can't 
[01:48:00]  afford it probably can't afford the tickets only when your team oh that's classic though then you  be honest this is the problem with this is the problem with fucking racial conversations and i can  feel a bunch of them because oh it's look but i don't know just admit it there's no other reason  it would be bad to you except for it's a little well bit niggery for you i i guess and foreign i get  there's no regular white boys playing basketball no more yeah but how do i relate to hockey guys 
[01:48:30]  they're all canadian yeah but they're regular white boys can just because they're white that i i go  yes all right yeah and and i'm gonna tell you there's a lot of black guys playing hockey  if if those black guys there's like seven or eight now it's they're moving up that's a lot  it's noticeable comparatively speaking sure but that's not a lot to the fact that hockey is anti-black  it's just not meaning wait let me reiterate meaning it's not a sport that black people 
[01:49:00]  why don't black people like hockey uh it's you know what it is um for the basic point it's a it's too  expensive now i know a white guy goes because you got weak ankles nigger now  it's cold niggas don't like cold they don't like they got weak ankles it's it's an expensive sport  it's a play it's a daddy it's a daddy sport yeah it's a it's a daddy rinse the rink it's a daddy  buys a you know two three hundred dollar skates i guess that's the price of you know you're right 
[01:49:30]  you're right the the the fact that they have to get up at five in the morning but i never played  hockey really a little street hockey yeah street hockey that's why you don't play hockey you play  basketball basketball is easy a fucking hole is that why we like the sports we like it's because  we played them growing up and then absolutely that's why kids in person why can't we like  sports we never played though we can but you don't understand the question i don't know the answer  we don't because the reason because if you look at hockey it's a fucking cool sport to check out 
[01:50:00]  yes but you grew up on it you can't play it unless you were raised playing hockey and again like patrice  said you know that's a father thing it's a the equipment costs a lot you don't just get a  basketball and go to the fucking park and start shooting at any time you want right exactly ice  is hard to come by yeah yeah i'll tell you this much though with the whole lebron james thing i'm  back in i want to see the miami heat lose fucking 50 games this year why is everybody just it ain't 
[01:50:30]  gonna happen dude it ain't gonna happen everyone but i'll tell you something uh this is why somebody  made a point i don't know where but if you made it you made it i forgot but lebron won 66 games  without dwayne wade and chris bosh was it 66 66 no they didn't go 66 and 16 yeah i thought they  won 61 but the year before 66 they won 60 games oh i see he's he's been a 60 game winner and he  went to the championship his second year with without them they're not losing 50 games but when 
[01:51:00]  they lose the championship that's gonna be if they go they're not gonna fucking lose i'm all in  no i'm an nba fan again officially i'm announcing it here i will be watching a lot more games this  year this is a beastly team man yeah i understand but it's gonna happen to the knicks me and patrice  were talking uh the other day it's gonna happen to the knicks next year now the thing in the nba is  you have to build your super team they're not gonna get away super team lebron and these guys are not 
[01:51:30]  gonna get away with this shit other teams are now figuring out how they build their super team  well to not make it racial once again i'm telling you the nba will not allow the nba will not allow  niggas to run their these are all white men they're not gonna let niggas get together and go  and make decisions on what the fuck they're gonna what if they're talking in code trust me what if  they're talking in code and they got the same agent how that how does the nba prevent that how do 
[01:52:00]  they stop that the teams david stern what he is people go he's the commissioner but what he is  he's the voice of the owners he's the owner's boy so the owners anything that david stern is have  has a problem with the owners have a problem with the owners are not going to allow small market teams  are not going to allow the knicks the celtics the lakers to just buy championships it ain't going to  happen there's no um salary cap in baseball from far as i'm concerned which is why the yankees exist 
[01:52:30]  so hold on they're just going to allow uh miami to win fucking you know possibly five six it's too  late they've done that i'm saying but this so the nba in a way should allow a few more teams to make  their super team the nba is going to go you deal with it the have not you deal with it and then they're  gonna and then you're gonna have old school guys get an interview like jordan jordan would go if  that happened when he played we got yeah if isaiah bird and magic was on the same team jordan go 
[01:53:00]  fuck all three of you motherfuckers how about i'll beat you by myself that was basketball when i  loved to watch it now they go let's join forces gangsters they ain't fucking they ain't three  leaders this ain't the justice league of america i should say that michael jordan to nbc sports he said  this very recently over the weekend i believe i would have never you know called up larry called  up magic and said hey let's get together and play on one team i mean that's but that's things are 
[01:53:30]  different you know i can't i can't say that's a bad thing i mean that's the opportunity these kids have  today i mean you know in all honesty i was trying to beat those guys i gotta tell you i think michael  jordan follows patrice on uh twitter yeah that's exactly what patrice's whole argument everybody kind of  was making that same argument it's just that you look at jordan jordan built a team around him  and here's what they did they not only jordan got so good that they knew okay if bj armstrong who  was the who was the point guard then if he was fucking up let's get another bj armstrong dude 
[01:54:00]  that all he does is is make jump shots well steve kerr won a couple of championships because they  they know all we need if jordan's on the court if jordan's not going to take the last shot have a guy  once they collapse right kick it over and your job stupid is to hit jump shots what an amazing  three-point shooter huh it is i'm telling you dude i don't understand the lebron thing uh we go around  it's different he was one lousy player away from winning championships for cleveland he could have won 
[01:54:30]  he could have won he just was leaving and you know jordan told you and he and he was quite friendly  about it he's like i would never had called the greatest players in the world to say help  right he would have tried to beat them and he said it's different now and the different is this the  different is the money right jordan never made a hundred million dollar contract i don't think he's  ever signed a hundred million dollar contract he made all his money from endorsements or whatever  but the free agent i'm sure look the thing that sports people i think love about this lebron thing 
[01:55:00]  is the idea that the players do have a little power it gives you it gives you a little bit of  of like wow man yeah just it's it's the oj verdict it's just it gives you a little bit of pride  that yeah a nigga beat the system but now the system is going to have a nice boot on their neck  let's just sit let's say hi to jason jersey jason what am i doing wrong with the hockey thing with  patrice okay i know you love your hockey but jesus you got to do a little bit better job again at

[01:58:30]  watching it's not with their feet which is tough enough yeah if you were running around on just a  fucking you know floor right do you know how amazing it is is to skate as fast as you can  then stop that's fucking it is amazing that's amazing hockey fans check check dude getting back to  uh jordan uh well dwayne wade it's in the paper today and aol kind of fucked uh dwayne wade at first i 
[01:59:00]  was like what the fuck was he thinking and then you yeah you read a little more and you realize  aol fucked them it's my deal here see that's right wade uh had uh this to say for aol fan house  okay he was quoted saying this if we lose a couple in a row this season it will be like the world trade  center is coming down again that's like that's like wow obviously it got back to uh dwayne wade's  people and they're like whoa what the fuck that wasn't what he said you just kind of edited what 
[01:59:30]  he said to make it easy for for your website the what he actually said was we're going to be  wearing a bullseye uh wade reported but that's what you play for we enjoy the bullseye plus  they're going to be times when we lose two three games in a row and it seems like the world has  crashed down uh you're all going to make it seem like the world trade trade center is coming down  again but and this is what aol didn't add originally but it's not going to be nothing but a couple  of basketball games that's a lot different than the original fucking uh thing he said it's 
[02:00:00]  completely different it's the opposite right he covered his ass because he said hey but we're  just talking about basketball games here right the world you know when you mention the world  trade center gets everyone on edge and then you realize he covered his ass yeah by adding the  thing look it's only a couple of games in the end totally that fucking aol what what the hell  wow trying to get him fucked so trying to get him fucked and finally you might as well wrap up  sports with tiger cursed on tv so oh yeah that's a big deal today i guess what did he say i fucked 
[02:00:30]  name followed that he didn't do well with the british open another major goes by and uh tiger didn't win  huh he came in 13 something like that yeah yeah it's whatever i guess we're not to talk about  golf mostly like in the shit you don't like golf do you patrice do you like watching it  golfing hockey is like white sport very foreign to you if i got any black card i know you can't  you can't even but a lot of black people are into golf now who could afford to play golf growing up 
[02:01:00]  but there's a lot of golf fans it's just you know it's an old man's game too you know i might get  tiger made it a younger younger man sport but in general it's still a guy's sport right it's just  you know but this is tiger woods from the british open woods has missed that  i think the wind's blowing from the right you can't believe the ball should go that way  i think that they get to the situation where you're concerned about the wind the strength of the wind  is it going to affect the ball you imagine it will and then it doesn't and then you don't strike it as 
[02:01:30]  firm as you might do and you miss he is running hot with a five par to come tiger needs to get  moving right they play the music cover him up he's fucking saying fuck i think there are a few in  there i think there might have been a cocksucker there if you listen closely yeah fuck fuck who cares  if you're gonna have live mics you're gonna hear some curses of course what do you expect the guy not  to curse love a cat god damn tiger's great yeah to be able to fucking have people interested in that 
[02:02:00]  fucking you know how great tiger woods is i watched the british open the entire weekend i get up early  on weekend so it's right there on the tv right the guy was pretty pretty much out of it early  man he got so much coverage all the way through his last fucking hole on sunday oh yeah they don't care  they just usually if a guy drops out they're like you don't even see him again you're like what did  he walk off the course you don't even know if he's still out there they don't care over tiger they 
[02:02:30]  show pretty much every shot he does yeah that's how great he is when there's there was guys leading  this tournament that were just blowing everyone else away and they continue to you know show you boy  are they writing him off too huh they are writing him what do you mean um they just you could see you  could see the media or whatever you calling it you could just see him devise in a way to have  everybody say fuck tiger and and the cheating thing has disappeared but now it's the okay here's where 
[02:03:00]  all the other greats uh yeah yeah failed have fucked up and he only has five years but you know he he has  more because jack nicholson was a he was a nicholas he nick nicholas i'm sorry about that nicholas or  nicholas and um you got the the other great guy who's synonymous uh palmer arnold palmer and who's 
[02:03:30]  the one who kind of invented golf in this country uh ben hogan them these guys they they played golf  here's one of the things people forget tiger has innovated he innovated physical conditioning  yeah yeah yeah to go working out jack nicholas was a was just a physical bum yeah who was good  this tiger probably has 10 more years to 15 more years to go because he's in shape he's in shape  so so you they're trying to say oh it's over for tiger and his his chase because it's five years 
[02:04:00]  everybody gets old at 40 he's in better shape than any of those guys and he probably has those you  know some genes natural genes that yeah fucking help so he might still he still has a good shot  and he's got that big thigh muscle that the blacks have in him it's that thigh muscle that was bred in  during his slavery days really jimmy the greek keep talking i love this i got the last video of jimmy 
[02:04:30]  the greek ah sure they breed their big buck with the uh big black uh woman get that and uh what they get  is a stronger uh a negro oh oh bye bye jimmy bye jimmy the greek hold on let's play does he get  fired because it's true or he fired because he said it because he said he just said it here it is  here it is this goes this goes way back i love this for the the youngsters out there i mean there were  there was no one bigger than jimmy the greek for a while there every event this guy was so massively 
[02:05:00]  every big event that happened they would go to the handicapper jimmy the greek yeah to see who is  going to win what are the odds the belmont stakes he picked the horses the super bowl the teams the  overrun to the fucking did you see 30 30 that documentary about him no they have a documentary  the espn 30 30 for foot 30 and that statement was made in conjunction with the fact they was trying  to get the fuck get rid of him oh like they at that point he was just a a crazy old coot and it was 
[02:05:30]  like oh thank god cbs was like thank god he said that shit send a cameraman over there and just bait  him with questions yeah because he was starting to dip in his popularity at that point yeah oh yeah  well the dip got a lot dippier after this the black is a better athlete to begin with because he's been  bred to be that way because of his high thighs and big thighs it goes up into his back and they can jump  higher and run faster because of their bigger thighs this goes back all the way to the civil war 
[02:06:00]  when during the slave trading the big the owner the slave owner would would would would breed  his big black to his big woman so that he could have a big a big black kid  oh jimmy even in 2010 it's uncomfortable to hear the fucking knowing what he had as a career the  cameraman's jaw was on the floor he was like oh my god i am filming the last you will ever see of

Well,  all I know is that it was made in Sydney,  Australia.  I'm trying to locate the actual packaging.  I have a description of the packaging.  I don't have an actual picture of the packaging.  But it says it's an empty,  it's a yellow box, rather.  It says the new improved boy steel wool soap.  All right.  The soap is in the pad printed in red and black. 
[02:16:00]  The picture is of a winking aboriginal boy.  Oh, okay.  Yeah,  they got pretty racist over there in Australia.  Now,  that was,  that commercial was made when in 2000?  Yeah.

Let me,  let me go to Rob and go to.  Jesus.  Fucking awful,  awful people,  man.  Rob,  what do you got?  Hey,  guys.  Yeah,  last week, 
[02:18:30]  I did my own Mel Gibson remix.  I put it on YouTube if you guys want to hear it.  It's Peter Grissom versus Mel Gibson remix.  It's already got like close to 200 hits.  200 hits?  That fucking thing's going viral.  Wow.  That's amazing.  That thing's going to take off any time then.  That's it.  Hey,  I'm happy with 200 hits.  Perhaps more than that.  Well,  let's see how good it is,  Danny.  This guy really believes in what he did. 
[02:19:00]  Rape boy,  rape boy.  What?  Perhaps.  I punch it out.  You found it?  Yes.  All right,  let's take a listen.  He's over-inflating his hit count by just a smidgen.  Oh,  really?  What has he got?  189 views.  Oh,  boy.  He's pushing to 100.  Oh,  well.  Here it is.  I bet this sucks.  I just bet it sucks.  Hello?  You make my life so fucking difficult.  Who is this?  You have one more chance. 
[02:19:30]  And I mean it.  Now fucking go if you want.  But I will give you one more chance.  Uh,  okay.  At least the quality's good.  You make me want to smoke.  You fucked my damn.  You care about yourself.  Yeah,  you know what?  The hell we'll do then.  Yeah,  go to hell.  Go to hell.  What?  What?  Okay,  you bastard.  You want to play rough?  You need a fucking bat in my side of the head.  Holy crap.  You've got a sick mind.  You need a fucking doctor.  You need a fucking brain transplant. 
[02:20:00]  You need a fucking...  No,  excuse me for being a child.  It's no D-boy.  You get it now?  What mean?  They're good cuts.  Get it?  Hey,  Hey,  Hey,  Hey,  Stop it.  Stop it.  You fucking don't care about me.  I'm having a hard time.  You fucking yank,  you bitch.  You son of a bitch.  You son of a bitch.  Oh my God,  this is so bad.  What?  You hang out to them coming over there. 
[02:20:30]  You've been drinking.  What the?  You're in my house.  So I'll call the police and tell them there's someone in my house.  You,  you do not be more wrong.  Well,  I guess I should be going.  I don't want to miss the all you can eat schnitzel bar.  I'll tell you,  uh,  dude,  the guy I just called,  I'll tell you why this innately stinks.  Yes,  Patrice.  I'll tell you why.  And I'm not even,  you listen to it.  It stinks so bad. 
[02:21:00]  Just ruined the last hour of great radio.  I tell you why it stinks.  Right out.  Right.  And you hate to just say somebody put that word.  It's the other D-boy thing.  The D-boy things are from existing audio that you can't really,  the genius of it is to take audio that is straight up from one thing and meld it into something else that's straight up from one thing.  So when you go,  when you put D-boy,  when you put Mel Gibson up against Pat,  uh,  uh,  O'Brien, 
[02:21:30]  it,  you can't do much with it,  but figure out how to meld those two existing conversations into something else.  He's just using clips.  He took clips.  For many episodes.  Right.  You can,  there's a million episodes of The Family Guy that you could just take any word and put Peter Griffin to.  Right.  It makes no sense though.  It's not as,  it's just editing as opposed to creating something.  That's what you're going to call editing?  I know.  I mean,  I'm trying to not.  It sounds like he recorded it on a wax cylinder. 
[02:22:00]  It's just trying to help him.  Why,  why it's just,  it's just,  you could do it with the Carol Burnett show or fucking Seinfeld.  Yeah.  Who are these people?  What?  Who are these people?  It's like,  it's just,  it's.  I'm more impressed that he was able to,  like to upload that to YouTube.  Like if,  if,  if you know the process to get that up online with like a still picture,  then you need to,  you need to be able to like learn how to just fade in clips and fade them out and make things a little smoother than that.  I mean,  transitions are a little rough.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  It just,  that's,  it's just,  that's why it's.  I think the best one that came in from the listeners was from Dan,  the producer.  Oh yeah.  The Pulp Fiction one.  Do we have that to play in a break for him?  Give him another plug.  He does radio in Vancouver.  You should have Eric's telling me that you have in front of you.  All right.  Let me come up.  If we're going to play listener ones,  listener,  listener.  Here it is.  Okay.  We'll,  we'll play.  He's going in a break.  Let's not forget.  Patrice is going to be at the Miami improv this coming weekend.  So go see fucking Patrice. 
[02:23:00]  Yes.  If you're in the Miami area,  I'm telling you,  you're going to have a good time.  All right.  We'll do this.  That Jordan thing is great.  Patrice has never heard that before.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  I do that all the time.  Just like around the house or,  or driving.  I'll just start going.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  How does he shoot free throws and he can't do that?  You know what's fucked up about that?  How do you fuck that up?  12 different ways.  I don't know.  Can you fuck that up?  Try to fuck that up. 
[02:23:30]  12 different ways right now.  I am.  Let me tell you something.  You don't want to play?  Yeah.  The morning that you go in,  you expect,  you look at that and go,  boy,  this is going to be the best money ever made for 30 seconds.  Right.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Yeah.  See,  you just did it.  And then you go,  and they go,  can you do it a little,  is it in you?  Is it in you?  First,  you go through all the,  the,  the,  the,  the easy ones.  Yeah.  The different quotations.  Gatorade.  Exclamation point.  Is it in you? 
[02:24:00]  Question.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  Is it in you?  Period.  Gatorade.  Is it in you?  All right.  That's three though.  Gatorade.  Is it?  In you.  Is it in you?  You sing it.  Gatorade.  How many times?  Gatorade.  Is it?  Is it?  Because he sounds like he's,  is it,  is it,  is it in you?  You just did five,  but he did another fucking seven.  And then you start fucking up Gatorade.  Gate. 
[02:24:30]  O-raid.  O-raid.  Gate-o-raid it.  Like you said,  Gate-o-raid it.  It.  Gate-o-raid.  Is it in you?  Gate-o-raid is.  Gate-o-raid is.  So,  so we shouldn't fault Michael Jordan.  We should fault the people,  the engineer.  Yeah.  In that situation.  Yeah,  you fault it for saying,  you come in and they probably told,  can we,  I've done this a million times where it's like,  all right,  give us another read.  And,  you know,  and you go,  why?  Why?  Why?  One for safety. 
[02:25:00]  That's what one camera shows.  I love one camera show.  I think they had a funny show,  you know,  the office and,  and,  uh,  Larry saying all these one camera show.  But the thing about one camera shows,  it's like,  it's too long.  Like,  why,  why 4,000 takes?  Just,  you don't,  stop trying to fucking justify your existence.  I'll never understand that.  My,  my,  uh,  philosophy is that's why,  uh,  you don't see a lot of great comedies anymore.  Because they're too busy fucking doing the scenes over and over and over again to make it look right.  And then the, 
[02:25:30]  taking all the energy.  And the feeling is gone.  That's my theory on why,  like,  when we were growing up,  it seemed like there was a,  a new comedy popping out that everyone loved.  And you just don't get that anymore.  And I think it's because they're,  they,  they want to make sure the lighting's right.  And,  and you know what I mean?  I remember recording stuff and it's,  you think it's hysterical.  You wrote it,  you fucking do,  you record it.  Right.  And then after it's all mixed and arranged and everything,  by the time the final product is done,  you're like,  was this ever funny?  Yep.  This stinks. 
[02:26:00]  That's what happened to that little,  that pilot I did.  It's just like,  it was a,  it was a vision.  Yep.  And it's just so many people that think,  that think all the funny that I do.  Yeah.  Like that.  That's why I'm in deep shit.  I think it was me.  We were just talking,  going to the bathroom,  you know,  I I'm in deep shit.  Cause I,  what I think is funny and,  and committed to might stink and,  and fuck me funny.  But just what I think is funny.  Right.  It doesn't just ain't happening. 
[02:26:30]  No,  it doesn't.  It's not that it stinks.  It's not what mainstream media is looking for.  Really?  50 year old fucking hockey dude.  Really?  Really dude.  I,  I,  you know,  what's funny.  Yeah.  This is why I get upset.  And it's not sports.  I'm just going back.  There's a kid named Nate Washington,  Nate,  Nate Robinson who plays for the Celtics.  Now I used to play for the Knicks.  If you don't know sure five foot eight,  five foot nine,  uh,  uh,  uh,  a machine,  a basketball machine.  He's only good if he, 
[02:27:00]  if there's,  if there's fucking Bill,  David Banner or the Hulk,  he's only good when he's the Hulk,  but these old irrelevant guys try to make him play as David Banner.  They go,  you have to calm it down,  but he's only good as the fucking Hulk.  Let him be the Hulk.  Just let him,  he,  he wouldn't have made it to the NBA if he didn't always play as the Hulk.  Leave him alone.  So you get a guy that people go,  Oh,  he's funny.  The guys that come on your show, 
[02:27:30]  me,  Bob,  Bill fucking Rogan to a lot,  to a lot of degrees.  Like you go,  these guys fucking have been funny all their lives.  And then you get into the business part and Susan head of development thinks it's not good.  And you go,  what the fuck are you talking about?  Why did you hire me then?  Right?  Why am I here?  You could get a Joe,  anybody to do this then.  Holy shit.  You didn't hire me to be the Hulk like you're saying.  Yes,  I'm,  I'm funny because of how I've been, 
[02:28:00]  you know.  Hey,  we're going to move on,  but we were talking about LeBron James and Patrice mentioned it outside the studio.  I've seen the video as well.  I don't know why we didn't bring it up when we were talking about LeBron.  The heel turn video that's up on YouTube.  I think it's hilarious.  Have you seen it,  Ant?  Yeah.  You like?  I saw it when Patrice retweeted.  Yeah.  Oh,  you saw it?  You watched it?  Oh,  yeah.  It made me laugh,  man.  It's just so goofy and dumb.  Basically,  it's a classic wrestling heel turn,  but they,  they fucking put like a,  like a LeBron James face on one of the dudes. 
[02:28:30]  It's cheesy,  but it's so fucking,  it's so cheesy,  but it's just,  it just works.  At its cheesiness.  It's like,  oh my God,  what is he doing?  Uh,  I gotta get something out of the way.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday,  dear Jimmy. 
[02:29:00]  Happy birthday  to you.  Boo!  Yes.  Mr. Shitty Chess.  Out of all the days  that it is Jimmy's birthday,  today is legitimately  Jimmy's birthday.  How do we know for sure,  though?  What a gift I get.  Robert Duvall photo  on the way he was actually leaving  while I caught him going out the door.  Get out.  You got a picture with Robert Duvall  for your birthday.  Ah, 
[02:29:30]  you've got them.  He was walking out the door.  Will that be your best birthday present today?  Um,  no,  it's a cool one,  but I mean,  I'm really glad I came in.  Let me see it.  Yeah,  Jimmy just flew in from Montreal.  And his,  let me say.  He looks,  he looks good as an old man.  He must be 80 years old.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Let me see what Robert Duvall looks like now.  He's not a bad,  he's not a fucking decrepit old man.  He looks all right.  You're out,  Tom.  Looks like a fisherman.  If only he was in like one decent movie.  He hasn't aged it.  He stopped,  he stopped,  he stopped after what, 
[02:30:00]  like a,  what,  Apocalypse Now?  Has there been any since then?  It was,  he's been,  he was in,  he now plays loners now.  Lonely old coots with a gun on the porch.  Fucking,  or a,  or a fucking,  he's still a sheriff.  He plays sheriff on Hallmark Channel movies and shit,  but he's done enough where it's like,  he doesn't need to do anything else.  He's great even in those horrible movies.  They don't make a bad movie here and there,  and he's always good,  man.  He got old,  young,  and just stayed old looking. 
[02:30:30]  He hasn't aged from that in 20 years.  He still looks good.  He still looks good.  There are old Twilight Zones that he is in,  that he looks old.  Yep.  Balding is a motherfucker.  He's like bald and just fucking,  and you know,  he was like 23,  just horseshoe bald.  I think he deserves to be heard.  The best use of his hands,  any actor in history.  He would do like,  he would do this thing where his hands would be out in front of him and kind of cupped in.  Yeah,  yeah.  He had this great way of fucking,  yeah,  of using his fucking hands to him. 
[02:31:00]  What movie was that when he used his hands?  That was in,  with fucking Ned Beatty.  That was in Network,  where he played the fucking,  where he was,  he played the head of us,  of CA,  the network,  whatever,  CA,  yeah.  Yeah.  It was the network.  I was just talking about it.  Yeah.  I forgot the,  yeah.  He fired him.  Fucking Duvall.  Oh,  dude,  I couldn't believe that.  He had a,  he was great in Apocalypse Now,  too.  He was fucking tremendous.  And recently,  he had a,  who gives a shit scene in Crazy Heart,  and he was great.  I didn't see that yet.  You haven't seen it yet?  What is that?  I have it,  but I haven't seen it. 
[02:31:30]  Is that when he played the sergeant  and he was fucking with his kid?  Crazy Heart.  No,  that was great,  Santini.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  Yeah,  Santini.  Crazy Heart was the one that won,  you know,  some Oscars and shit.  What's his name?  Bridges.  I wanted him to just,  just talk to me like I was Toomer.  What did he say to you?  I wanted Toomer.  He was,  I just said,  because he was walking out with Tim Sabian,  and I was,  my eyes just opened.  Who's Tim Sabian?  He's,  he runs Howardstown.  We know him from YSP.  Oh,  okay,  okay.  He's been around for years,  Tim.  We know him.  But there's another guy I didn't know  with some shit like that.  No,  Tim's a good dude.  Everyone knows everyone here.  He's fucking, 
[02:32:00]  and he's walking out,  and I'm like,  it's Duvall.  Like,  I had seen him before,  but I'm like,  that really is him.  Yeah,  me and Kenny happened to walk through the fucking doors in reception,  and there he was.  And,  I just was like,  are you sure you're saying,  I kept a picture?  Like,  there was no protocol.  I didn't even say hi to Tim.  Yeah,  yeah,  nothing.  And Tim's trying to duck out of the way.  Oh,  hey,  you got it.  I don't know.  It just,  he goes,  all right,  man,  just make it fast.  It's not,  and then,  and then there was no flash happening,  and I'm like,  Kenny,  I'm going to bite you.  Oh,  no.  He told you to make it fast?  No,  but not like a dick.  He's just like, 
[02:32:30]  all right,  just make it fast.  He's supposed to get out of it.  Robert Duvall?  Yeah,  but he wasn't being a jerk.  He's just,  he's old.  He wants to go home.  Make it fast,  lads.  Yeah.  He's one of those actors that can walk the streets by himself,  you feel?  Like,  I saw Joe Pesci in The Village,  and he just,  you just go,  hey,  and he gets that look like,  I'm not the guy that people are going to be around fucking with on that level.  Alec Baldwin is a very in the street guy.  Just kind of,  yeah.  Alec Baldwin,  he wanders the Upper West Side.  He's just an in the street guy.  He almost looks homeless if you didn't know it was Alec Baldwin. 
[02:33:00]  I've never seen him in the movie.  Who couldn't?  Oh,  yeah,  I've seen him many times.  What celebrity could not possibly walk the street?  I would say Brad Pitt couldn't.  I would say any in the magazines on a regular basis,  guys,  and Joe Pesci was never that.  Brad Pitt could not.  I don't think George Clooney could be.  There were two,  I've seen a million celebrities,  because they walked the Upper West Side a lot.  There were two that drew ridiculous crowds.  Two.  Yoko Ono walked home from the movie theater once.  What gives a fuck about Yoko? 
[02:33:30]  People were out of their minds running out of every fucking store.  Glennon's dick in her.  That's the only reason.  It was Yoko,  and the only other one was Keanu Reeves.  But then again,  he was wearing a long fucking Matrix fucking black coat in the middle of summer,  so I think that alone made people go,  oh, what the fuck.  But they came out of...  I think the Beavers,  the singers probably can't.  Huh?  I don't think the singers...  I think Justin Bieber can't.  And I don't think Lady Gaga can.  Attacked by little girls.  Know who I saw walk around like,  and no one gave a shit?  Dustin Hoffman.  Wow.  Yep, he's won. 
[02:34:00]  He's won how?  He walked around with a thing of flowers  that he got from the corner bodega,  wandering around just looking up in the air.  I think we talked about this on the air,  and no one bothered him whatsoever.  There's an energy, man.  Joe Pesci had an energy of...  You know, Ice Cube used to do a rap long ago.  He goes,  when you see me in the street,  shake my hand and make it a firm shake.  Say, what up, Ice Cube?  It didn't break,  because if you're hanging there,  I'm going to tell you loud and clear,  get off my dick, nigga,  and tell your bitch to come here. 
[02:34:30]  So, Joe Pesci gives that kind of vibe  where it's like,  you just go, hey, Joe,  and he just goes, hi.  He goes, it's the bitches gotta get you.  Yep, you just keep it moving.  Dustin Hoffman got that.  I hate to tell you,  Yoko drew a crowd, man.  People were out of their fucking minds.  Yeah, they fucking didn't want to touch  John Lennon juice, man.  Supposedly, she doesn't walk often.  She called off her driver,  and then me as a creep,  I just fucking followed her home.  Is that the driver that was recording her?  I'm sure she appreciates that, huh?  I wonder if that was the driver  that was recording her.  There was that guy secretly taping her.  She was in the same movie theater 
[02:35:00]  when I saw, I think it was,  yeah, Grizzly Man.  And I'm in the bathroom,  and fucking Sean Lennon's in the bathroom.  I'm like, holy shit.  Grizzly Man?  So I go to my, huh?  I think just making jokes  about Yoko's horrible speech.  Oh, shit.  Grizzly.  Grizzly.  Grizzly.  So all of a sudden,  I'm in the bathroom with Sean Lennon.  I'm like, holy shit.  I tell my girl,  and sure enough,  he's hanging with Yoko,  and they called off their driver  and started walking down Broadway.  That's like seeing Priscilla Presley. 
[02:35:30]  I bet you Priscilla Presley  gets bothered  because she got,  she got,  I mean,  I would,  at this point,  John Lennon is bigger than Icon.  I mean,  you get John Lennon aura on you.  A lot of people are creeping,  they're creepy  when it comes to that  posthumous shit.  Elvis stink.  Oh,  Elvis stink.  Michael Jackson stink  is going to be huge soon.  You know who used to walk  around the neighborhood  and no one bothered him?  Conan O'Brien.  He gives off that vibe, man.  Not a one.  And I bet you Lennon  walks around  when no one fucks with him.  I bet you.  But it's different.  New York and L.A. 
[02:36:00]  we're talking,  but in fucking Ohio,  you know,  none of these people  can walk around.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Who's the,  Lennon seems accessible  about people.  He speaks to people.  He seems like he can walk  through the streets.  Letterman doesn't.  Letterman couldn't  because I think Letterman  seems like too inaccessible.  Who the fuck is the guy  from Ghostbusters,  the nerd?  Bill Murray?  Carl Ramis.  Carl Ramis?  Rick Moranis.  Rick Moranis?  Seen him a million  fucking times.  No one bothers him.  No one cares.  By the way,  that's not the Rick Moranis  movie you access 
[02:36:30]  to make safe.  I know,  I know.  It's like,  honey,  I blew up the kids.  I know,  you're right.  But you know what?  He's to the point  where no one even cares.  They don't even look.  He is almost done point.  They don't even look.  Yeah,  he is.  At least Dustin Hoffman  they were looking  but weren't bothering.  There's a whole thing.  He's at that level  where it's,  oh shit,  he produced Godfather 12.  It's at the point  where you,  I just found out  something interesting.  I didn't know  and this might be  all white news  but I didn't know  that your girl,  I was watching a movie  called Prophecy. 
[02:37:00]  It's an old horror movie.  What's the girl,  the sister from  The Godfather?  Oh,  Talia Shai?  I didn't fucking know  she was your boy's sister.  Oh,  right.  Francis Ford Coppola.  This family's a mafia.  Yeah.  I didn't realize  these motherfuckers  were so indigenous.  Yeah,  yeah.  To Hollywood.  Nicolas Cage.  Nicolas Cage is part  of that whole show.  I don't hear shit  about the Wayans brothers.  These motherfuckers,  the Coppolas 
[02:37:30]  are nepotism  in this business  to the fucking  10th degree.  Goddamn royalty.  And he has  his brother,  Francis Ford's  other,  his uncle  used to do  all the music  from the fucking movie.  I was like,  what the fuck?  Wikipedia has  the Coppola family tree.  I'm not upset about it.  It's just,  I didn't realize  these motherfuckers  were so dug in.  Why did Nicolas Cage  use his last name?  I know.  He didn't want  the Coppola name.  He wanted to do it  on his own.  Why would you want  the Coppola name? 
[02:38:00]  I think I remember  reading something about that  and he wanted to do it  on his own  without any recognition.  I would trade in  the Hughes name  in a second.  I want to change  my name to Coppola.  Yeah, exactly.  I think I want  to do it now.  He had the option.  If Nicolas Cage  fucking flopped,  he'd be Nicolas Coppola  in a second.  Nicolas Coppola Cage,  like Cougar Mellencamp.  Yeah, exactly.  That's the family tree.  Anything on there?  But Talia Shire,  Jason Schwartzman.  She wasn't Talia Coppola  ever.  No, no.  Ever was she Talia Coppola.  His daughter  was Coppola. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Now she's  big time director,  but when she was Coppola,  she single-handedly  almost destroyed  the Godfather.  Oh, the franchise.  She almost wrecked it.  Oh, what a mess.  You said Jason Schwartzman.  That's Talia Shire's son.  He stars in...  I didn't fucking know that.  Yeah, he stars in  Border Death.  And he got another brother.  He was in Rushmore,  obviously.  I didn't see Rushmore.  Rushmore is a good movie.  He was in  I Heart Huckabees.  Yeah, I liked the Rushmore,  man.  He was good in that one.  Motherfucker, boy.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know that.  Anyone else on that  family tree? 
[02:39:00]  Look at the family tree.  That's pretty...  Jesus Christ.  All in Hollywood, probably.  Oh, yeah.  That's a family tree  without a whole lot  of nuts on it, right?  Happy birthday, Chip.  Holy shit, man.  We also have Randy Couture.  That's why he came  back from Montreal, huh?  I also don't want to miss  if I don't have to.  Like, tomorrow I do  and then I got to go to L.A.  So I don't want to miss days 
[02:39:30]  if I don't have to.  But it's your birthday.  I know.  Randy Couture's coming in  and Terry Crews  from the Old Spice commercial.  That's how I know.  He's also in  Everyone Hates Chris, right?  He's the father.  He's been around a long time, man.  But now we all know him  from the Old Spice commercials.  He's coming in.  And he's doing Ice Cube's  new show on TBS.  He's a TV show?  Yeah, Ice Cube.  He's another father.  He's a father again.  And he's in The Expendables,  Terry Crews and Randy Couture.  I think that's going to be  a halfway big movie. 
[02:40:00]  Like, middle big.  Like, 18.  Almost big?  Almost big.  Almost big.  What did 18 do numbers-wise?  What, it was 60?  Did well, right?  I think it did okay.  Which is that?  Well, The Expendables got  Stallone, Schwarzenegger,  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke,  Jason Statham.  That means this movie's  going to suck.  You don't like Jason Statham?  No, no, not because  of Jason Statham.  There's too many big,  big fucking names.  Usually, the movies  with a lot of big names  don't do well.  I don't think they're 
[02:40:30]  as nostalgic as they  think they are.  I don't think they,  they came together on this,  this nostalgia kind of  coming back thing.  But I don't think that they're,  I think the only one  that's nostalgic might be  Schwarzenegger and Stallone.  But the rest are pretty  existing now.  Dolph Lundgren.  Yeah, yeah.  He's been doing movies  retrograde.  Jesus, yeah.  Eric Roberts  was a great actor.  Underrated, by the way.  Love Eric Roberts. 
[02:41:00]  Great, one of the great  fucking, for the time  that he was great.  Should have been way  bigger than he was.  10 minutes.  What happened?  Fuck.  I don't know.  He had that hair lip?  Did he do a drug thing  or something?  I don't know.  Something happened with him.  He should have been  in a million great movies.  Better than fucking,  better than Stacy Keech  and Joaquin Phoenix, man.  Oh yeah, Joaquin Phoenix.  Greatest hair lip actor  of our time?  Of our time.  The greatest hair lip actor.  Him and Star 80?  Fucking Cheech.  Doesn't even have a  It's a knuckle on his mouth. 
[02:41:30]  That's terrible.  Fucking Star 80.  I don't remember  Star 80 anymore.  I haven't seen that movie  in years.  Star fucking 80.  The thing he did  with Jon Voight  was the runaway train.  I didn't know  he had a hair lip.  Oh yeah.  He was in  Pope of Greenwich Village.  Pope of Greenwich Village.  He was Charlie.  They took Mike Dumb.  He was that guy.  And Mickey Rourke,  by the way,  another guy that,  but we know  what happened to Mickey,  but he's got a  hair face.  Looks like Little Kim.  How did the Iron Man  the second movie come out  and I missed it? 
[02:42:00]  It made about  a good 300, 400,  maybe more.  Was it good?  Or was it a bomb?  People loved it.  It wasn't a bomb.  What the fuck happened?  You just missed it.  Oh, I think I had a kid  somewhere in there.  Yeah, I might have done it.  I'm finally coming out  of the fog.  I just realized  I missed the Iron Man sequel.  What the fuck?  I hate how people  go away and come back,  though.  Meaning,  how they control that.  It's like Mickey Rourke,  gone.  Now he's back.  He did The Wrestler  and now that fucking  mashed up.  No, no, no.  Sin City.  Sin City kind of brought 
[02:42:30]  him back.  That was a while ago, too.  Then he did The Wrestler,  which super brought him back.  Now he's like villains  in movies.  But he was playing himself  in The Wrestler.  Was that impressive?  It was a great movie.  It's fucking very hard  to play yourself, I think.  It's still okay  if you play yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw a movie called  Rampage over the weekend.  Who was in that?  It was like fucked up.  I don't know.  There's like no people  I've ever seen in it.  But it's this young guy  and he just,  he's like just inundated 
[02:43:00]  every day by the news  and the horribleness  and everything.  And he just fucking  puts on this  armored,  goddamn,  bulletproof suit  and goes out  and fucks up  his hometown,  his small hometown.  Is it like falling down?  It's like falling down,  but 80 times  on crack.  Yeah.  80 times more  violent and heinous.  Anything on crack.  There's one scene  where he's standing there 
[02:43:30]  and he's got two like  Uzis  and this complete  fucking suit  where cops can just  shoot at him.  Is this a made for DVD thing?  I don't know where  the fucking came from.  Where'd you see it?  I never heard of it.  Pay-per-view.  I think the same guy  did that did  The Chronicles of  Jerry Sherbert.  Jerry Sherbert.  It's just a bad name  for a movie.  Of course it is.  That's horrible.  Well, why don't we  know this movie?  He walks up to this chick  at some point.  Are you a violent movie  enjoyer?  I love that shit.  Please watch  The Newest Punisher. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah?  Punisher?  The Newest Punisher.  Warzone.  Enjoy The Newest Punisher.  If you like violence  fantastically violent.  Rampage?  Can I find it?  Well, we find  the Rampage  but not  Rampage the movie.  You gotta put  Rampage  like 2010.  When did they make it?  This fucking chick  it's new  is cowering  in a corner  because they've  told everybody  that this guy's  like fucking  this town up  and she's cowering  in this corner  and the guy just  kind of loads his gun  up and goes off. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, hey.  Hi.  Okay, I'm looking  at the trailer.  Pretty bad, huh?  He already  has indie hair.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He has independent  film hair.  He does.  This means it might  be good.  Why haven't we  heard this one?  He's so precious,  aren't we?  Everyone's gotta live.  Everyone's gotta be happy.  He looks like  Adam Baldwin.  It's a joke.  It's an absolute joke. 
[02:45:00]  You think people  are equal?  They're not.  They're not.  He plays a good psychopath.  Yes.  I mean, that's my plan.  That's what I want to do.  Let's just  clean the world  so maybe  the rest of us  can sustain  a little bit  of life.  These people  are out to kill us.  I just got a montage  thing happening here.  You're a little  cranky.  Working out. 
[02:45:30]  He puts his  fucking shit together.  Gets his guns  and just fucking  a downward spiral  to the end  of all time.  And there's no chance  so we can survive.  So we can survive.  These people are out to kill us.  My name is Ben.  Do you have any thoughts?  The violence is amazing.  It just  shoots the  shit out of people. 
[02:46:00]  With no mercy.  You know why  this is violent  right away?  They showed a death  in the trailer.  Yeah, no shit.  Oh, of course.  We had him in.  Oh, good old  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  Of course that's him.  We had him in.  That crazy German director.  What was he in for again? 
[02:46:30]  I figured.  The movie he did  where they chose  the plane hitting  the trade center?  Yeah, I think it was  based off a video game  called Postal.  Postal, yeah.  Right, right, right.  Very good, Danny.  Yeah, one part...  He doesn't fucking  hold back.  One part, he fucking  stabs this cop  in his liver  and then pulls it out  and the cop's just  kind of fucking  dying there,  laying there.  And he just leans over  and goes,  it'll take about  eight seconds.  Like, tells him,  you know,  you'll be dead  in about eight seconds.  Don't worry about it.  Just fucking...  I'm watching this going, 
[02:47:00]  this is so fucking bad  and twisted.  How was the story, though?  You know what?  What was the storyline,  Greg?  It's got...  You know what?  I'm gonna...  I'm gonna Wikipedia it.  It's got a fucking  twist to it.  Better than taken?  What wasn't?  I didn't like the...  Me and Patrice  loved the taken.  The lack of soy sauce hair.  Every time I see  that fucking movie,  I'll pop it on  every so often  when it's on.  And all I can think of  is Jimmy saying  this asshole  dyed his hair with soy sauce.  I'm not saying that...  And he didn't ruin it for me. 
[02:47:30]  He just ruined his hair.  He ruined face-off for me.  But he didn't ruin taken.  Taken still,  I love taken.  I'm not saying that taken  didn't have problems,  but it's like  retard run daughter.  I want a pony.  Jesus,  I gotta watch  fucking Rampage.  No wonder though,  it'll never be big  because of society now  and a lot of violence.  And Uwe Bola,  however you say his name,  makes really controversial  flicks, that guy.  He sure does.  Hey, Danny,  can you find the scene  he did  where there's a window washer  and a plane in his head? 
[02:48:00]  It wasn't the trade center.  It was just a window washer.  And it gave him  a lot of shit.  And you know what?  Someone came up with  Departed,  so I'm wrong.  But I think movies  where they get the huge  all-star over-the-top cast,  they usually don't do well.  But Departed  obviously did great.  Maybe The Godfather,  maybe,  sneaking in there.  Yeah,  but were those guys  all-stars when that movie came out?  They absolutely,  I would say they were.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  What is this?  Postal clip?  Oh, shit.  Wow. 
[02:48:30]  Wow.  That just made my stomach hurt.  Yeah.  This guy is great.  Yeah, he wasn't fucking around.  Show that again  in the beginning.  Oh, I got a fucking...  What would it be  if you were a window washer?  It's a window washer.  How the fuck do you film this?  That's some CGI shit,  motherfucker.  That's great.  No, I understand what it is,  but that looks way too fucking...  Hold on,  stop this right there.  Stop it.  Stop it right there.  First of all,  first of all,  what you just said just now  matches my fuck up the other day 
[02:49:00]  and Jimmy's.  I don't want you to be able  to get past the fact  that you fucking said,  hey, man, CGI.  I said CGI.  Fucking asshole.  You really crashed  the plane into the guy.  Really?  Really?  All right, look,  you're absolutely right.  George Lucas,  that fucking beats  my stupid shit  and trumps his stupid shit.  Look, it ties it.  Thank you.  It really does.  Fucking...  I'll give us a three-way tie.  Man, we've come a long way  since fucking silent film.  Really? 
[02:49:30]  If you notice,  Fatty Arbuckle...  Really, Sesame...  Fatty Arbuckle's flying the plane.  I just wanted to...  I just wanted to let you know  I caught CGI, you asshole.  I got your sweetheart,  Mary Pickford,  as the window washer.  This is scary, man.  This is...  This makes my stomach tight.  There's actually...  Go ahead, let it go.  There's a fucking...  There's a...  There's a special  on the towers falling.  Did you ever hear the story  of the guy  who was in the fucking,  like, the 92nd floor?  He's fucking Illmatic, man.  And the plane came in  and it actually hit 
[02:50:00]  right above him  in his floor.  It's a true story.  He lived.  The plane came...  You guys have seen him  interviewed, I'm sure.  No, I haven't.  I got to check it out.  Is it online?  And there's a graphic of it.  They actually show you  what it might have looked like  because he's telling the story  about how I looked out the window  and the plane was there.  Like, he saw the plane heading  and when it came in  it, like, crashed  the floor above him.  But I guess the damage was so...  He was right there  so the damage went beyond him,  I guess.  But you should look him up.  9-11...  Jesus, get the fuck out of here.  It's on YouTube 
[02:50:30]  and they show the graphic  of what he saw coming in.  Get the...  Wow.  And it's...  It's really fucking chilling.  What is this movie, Postal, about?  I don't know.  I just...  I know he got a lot of shit for that.  I bet.  But I thought that was well shot.  That looked amazing, man.  It wasn't like he was goofing on it.  Jesus, that hurt.  Pretty good.  That just hurt.  Just now.  It was too fast.  It just hurt.  Ouch.  Like that fast shit.  God damn it.  I think a disturbing scene  in a movie was Fight Club  when Edward Norton's in the plane 
[02:51:00]  and it just gets broadsided  by the other plane.  Oh, yeah.  And people are getting sucked out.  He has the fantasy  that he wishes  that every time he flies  there would be a mid-air collision  or some shit  and it just looks...  Yeah.  And of course,  Danny gets it in two seconds.  Every time the plane  banked too sharply  on takeoff or landing,  I prayed for a crash  or a mid-air collision.  Anything.  That's well shot. 
[02:51:30]  See, that's fucked up, right?  It's fucked up.  The whole side of the plane  opens up.  But I'll tell you something,  you can't really get  the full effect of that  just watching a clip.  Like, one time,  I used to do this.  I used to have, like,  a car with a really nice  sound system.  Like, I was into that  at the time.  And sometimes I would  take my laptop  and I'd watch movies  in my car  because it sounded  really good.  That fucking scene...  Do you understand  how psychotic that is?  Thank you, Jimmy.  I don't know.  Trust me.  But it sounded  fucking ridiculous. 
[02:52:00]  Like, I've seen this  a thousand times  and that fucking scene  scared the shit out of me.  By the way,  that's a man who's  heavily into kiddie porn.  How do you sit in the laptop?  How do you sit in the car  with the laptop?  Yeah, you're not watching.  In the woods.  I had to live with  my grandfather for a while.  It was full of roaches  and dirt.  I didn't like it.  Oh, was it really?  Yeah, we used to talk  about you living with him.  The more time I spent  outside of that apartment  was more beneficial for me.  Poor Danny and his vehicle.  Yeah, I spent a lot of time  in my car.  Oh, my God.  That is really psychotic  because there's a good sound...  How'd you hook the laptop 
[02:52:30]  into the fucking...  With one of those  tape adapters.  Jesus.  You guys want a break  so we get ready  for Terry Crews  and Randy Couture?  Speaking of movies,  they're promoting  The Expendables.  Can I say one thing  before we break?  Yeah.  Two things I watched.  I did a gala last night  in Montreal.  It was good.  I went on.  It was a little late  and it was hot  and whatever.  And fucking Panette went on.  John Panette.  I hadn't watched...  I've never seen Panette  for more than a minute  like in a clip.  He is fucking awesome.  I'm not breaking ground 
[02:53:00]  by saying that  but I watched him  get a standing ovation  and I had just worked  the crowd.  Like I saw they were tired.  It was hot.  He is fucking unbelievable  that son of a bitch.  Really?  Is he fat again too?  He's fat  but he's not like he used...  He's nowhere near  what he used to be.  Yeah, he got the stomach  stapling and went down  to like a sickly size.  And then uh...  He went down  and was sickly size.  Obligated to do it now.  Dude, he fucking closed  with a bit on gluten.  It may be an old bit.  Gluten?  He made gluten funny. 
[02:53:30]  I couldn't believe  that he was making gluten...  I couldn't make gluten funny  if I smeared it  on a retarded girl's tits  while I fucked her.  He made it fucking...  You kind of made it funny there, Jimmy.  But I mean,  he really kind of did.  He made a really smart  funny bit  on gluten  and he closed with it.  Is this Terry Crews?  Should we bring him right in?  No, it's fucking  Dak from Enemy Mind.  It's fucking...  It's Richard Steele  from the Republican Party.  Ali Salasi.  Yeah, it's a fucking  Ethiopian nickel. 
[02:54:00]  That's the guy looks like.  So, John Panette funny.  What was the second thing?  Oh, I went...  I was on YouTube  and I just watched  a little bit of Panette last night.  I couldn't believe...  Like, I knew he was funny, but...  I gotta check him out now.  I got a lot of shit to do  after the show  because of you guys.  But I watched Rickles in 85  go up at Reagan's inaugural.  Oh, Rickles is the king.  I'm pissed that we're...  that he's too old  for us to completely appreciate.  Dude, it was Reagan's inauguration.  And, you know,  it was all of Washington.  It was a massive 5,000 feet.  Could you get that?  That's worth playing. 
[02:54:30]  Fuck it.  I don't know if it'll translate  without being...  Let's try.  Don Rickles.  1985 Reagan inaugural.  A million years ago.  But when you just see  the way this guy worked  in front of the president  and the entire...  He was just fucking  amazingly fun of them.  But you got...  You know,  they were all friends, though.  Oh, yeah, right.  They did those roasts.  So that's...  It's less intimidating.  It's like...  He roasted him right.  Yeah, he's buddies with...  He was buddies with Reagan  back then.  But it's still the president  and the fucking, you know...  Rickles is an animal, man.  Fucking animal.  Yeah, I'm not dismissing... 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, I'm just saying...  You know...  It's just so...  Yeah, and the comedian...  It's just so little Webster...  Oh, Webster, right.  Little Webster.  Oh, Rickles looks old in 85.  Does he make a joke  about the little colored kid?  Be funny.  It's Little Webster.  Hands up, Rickles,  the microphone.  Look how old Rickles  was already in 85.  Yeah.  25 years ago.  The first black kid I ever saw  that will definitely  never play basketball. 
[02:55:30]  That was short.  I was destroyed.  I asked you, huh?  40 million stars.  I get a little kid out here  who doesn't know  what time it is  and brings me out  and you're standing here  with the band  with the same cockamamie music.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Try to learn it.  The president's here.  It's a big shot for me.  Last night we had Bush.  Well, I'll tell you this.  He was great.  Did you see him and the wife  after the show?  He was in the lobby going,  nobody knows me.  I gave him a cookie.  He went away.  He didn't know what time it was. 
[02:56:00]  It's topical.  I'll tell you this.  Did you see some of his movies?  Stiffs.  I'll tell you this.  How this guy became president?  When he was governor,  I couldn't get in touch with him.  I had a cousin.  Did three months,  three months in a county jail.  I made a phone call.  I said, give me a break.  He was too busy.  Tied up.  Wouldn't make that.  He's now doing 14 years  and he's the president  of the United States  sitting in the White House  with Nancy walking around  going,  Art Rickles' cousin  is doing a lot of time.  Good evening, Mr. President.  Nice to see you, sir. 
[02:56:30]  And your lovely wife, Nancy.  It's a big treat for me  to fly all the way  to California  to be here  for this kind of money.  I got to interrupt him.  Reagan's roaring.  He really was.  Reagan loved him.  Yeah.  Best timing ever, though, Rickles.  We got a commotion  outside the...  Yes.  What's going on?  What do we got?  What do we got?  I don't even know  what we got.  I see women.  I see Terry.  Hello.  I had no idea.  Who's here, Steve?  It's Terry and Reagan.  All right on.  Bring him right in.  Fuck, I want to break. 
[02:57:00]  Randy.  Randy, how are you?  Stay nice.  What's up, my man?  How you doing, man?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Terry, how you doing?  How you doing?  What's up, Randy?  All right, Terry Crews.  Good to see you again, man.  All right, Terry.  How you doing?  What's up?  What's up?  How you doing a little of that?  What's up, man?  Wow.  Our introductions.  Oh, there we go.  How many people?  There'll be so many people here.  Yeah, let's do it.  It's me, boy.  So, oh.  There you go.  Thanks, man.  And let's go take the couch. 
[02:57:30]  This is Jet Li's wife in the movie?  Of course.  Makeup for the radio?  Holy fuckballs, man.  You have fucking changed, nigga.  Holy shit.  We probably wouldn't up here, baby.  That's how it's doing.  Terry Crews is getting makeup for his radio appearance.  Look at him, man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Smoothness.  More shit.  Shit.  You got muscles on your muscles and your abs and your shit. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  And I exfoliate everything, too.  Fuck.  Long way from T-Money, man.  I know.  And I was a big, I'll say, to start off, that was one of my favorite shows when it  was on.  Battle Dome?  Battle Dome.  Yeah.  And you played T-Money.  And if you didn't see Battle Dome, it was a show.  It was like American Gladiators meets wrestling, almost, where it's like you.  But what was one of my favorite things back then is you had a fight.  They did this cross promotion with WCW.  Yep. 
[02:58:30]  And I always wanted to ask you is that you, did you really punch Steiner in his face?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He, they was doing this cross thing with WCW.  And he punched, was it a mistake or, he really punched another wrestler?  Straight up.  And it just looked real.  And it looked like you heard him.  And it looked like he said, what the fuck?  What'd you do that for?  We really, the thing was with me is that I always took it a little too far. 
[02:59:00]  Just with the whole.  On the show, too, by the way.  On the show.  There were times where he got.  We just regular people, Terry.  Yeah.  Now you get the fucking makeup on radio.  You ain't shit.  I just want to say that.  You came along with knocking motherfucking real dudes out to makeup on the radio, man.  God damn it.  Money makes you feel better.  Don't you?  Dude, I get mani-pedis and everything.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry, though.  But I was a big fan of that show. 
[02:59:30]  They had to cancel it, man, because people were getting broke up.  I mean, I was one of the guys that survived.  It was that extreme.  And then once they knew you, you know, you were on our name.  And then people were training just to get you.  It just got too violent.  It was crazy.  I remember that show, though.  It's a great.  I've been, that's when I, that was the first time I noticed where you are.  And then it's just, you know, Hollywood is one of those places.  So you see, once you see somebody, you see what the progression is. 
[03:00:00]  You do see, man.  You know, I did a, I was extra in training day.  And so when you see training day now.  I fucking, you didn't say a fucking word.  The leader of either the Bloods or the Crips was like, you was part of him.  But that guy was real.  That was all, no, everybody else in the jungle was real.  All the other gangsters were real.  I came to visit the set to watch Denzel.  And literally the director, Antoine Fuqua, was like, hey, man, you want to be in this movie?  And I'm like, yeah.  He said, look, take your shirt off. 
[03:00:30]  We're going to the roof.  I go to the roof.  I'm the guy with the pigeons, the whole thing.  You were the pigeon guy?  That's me.  If you see the lumpy head, that's me.  I was the pigeon guy.  You were flipping pigeons?  Flipping pigeons.  Oh, shit.  That's Terry Crews.  I suck.  Flipping pigeons in a world.  You were the pigeon flipper?  I'm the pigeon flipping brother.  That's it.  That's me.  Holy shit.  That's me.  I go.  And I'm going to tell you something else.  In movies, I noticed this about maybe a year ago.  You know, in any time you see someone who's playing a gangster who looks really mean, real 
[03:01:00]  gangsters, like, if you watch American Gangster, they never have a mean face.  You see Randy's face?  Like, the comfort of either killing you with his hands or I'll shoot you immediately makes  you easy.  You were the meanest face motherfucker on there.  And I'm getting makeup on the radio now.  He will kill you.  He's smiling and he will destroy you.  Do you fight mixed martial arts at all or no? 
[03:01:30]  No.  No.  I'm the NFL guy.  I played seven years in the NFL.  Rams, right?  Rams, Packers, Chargers, Redskins, Eagles.  Wow.  But you were really a beast in, like, college though, right?  Yeah.  I did my thing, man.  I did my thing.  I'm still...  You know, it's off of looks.  That's it, man.  You know, abdominals.  That's me.  And let me ask you this, man.  This is...  And this is...  Oh, shit.  How do I ask this shit?  This is...  You know, black people always have... 
[03:02:00]  We can't be as free as white people.  Meaning, white people can do anything.  And they get to just do anything.  Was there any of that fucking blackness question when you had to get naked almost?  Oh, yeah.  When you go, man, I'm...  Am I up here with just muscles, naked, and shorts?  We turn around.  Everything has to be Martin Luther King Jr.  You are now representing all black men.  Right!  When you put on these red shorts, you do understand that you... 
[03:02:30]  And I'm like, yo, man.  Exposure!  I'm just saying, bump it.  You have to admit...  I don't give a damn.  If black people voted, which one of you they would want to represent the men, they're going  to vote for him.  What the man part?  But I'm saying the point...  See, this is...  The point is, like, the blockage meaning...  Okay, Jim Carrey.  If you go, hey, Jim, you want to put this shit costume on and tap dance with a feather?  It's like, in your ass?  I'm going to do it!  And it's no block.  But it's like...  It's...  You know the NAACP. 
[03:03:00]  You see...  And he's in fair condition.  And the other motherfucker that's riding...  The naked guy riding a horse and...  It's just like, you know black people go, why is this nigga naked?  And it's like, you have that block that keeps...  That has to make...  So I was wondering if you had to have that...  You go, alright, family, then I don't want NAACP fucking with me.  How is that...  No, I don't.  I do what I love.  I do what I want to do.  If I think it's funny, if I think it's great, I'm going to do it. 
[03:03:30]  And, you know, I mean, that's the thing.  You can never...  Let me tell you, my wife is not black enough for some people.  You know what I'm saying?  Is she black, your wife?  I've seen you speak to show.  No, she's black.  She's black.  But she's half white.  So in this country, that makes you black.  Obama's black.  Well, I got a half white girlfriend, too.  But your wife looks Spanish or something.  But she's half black.  She's black.  Gary, Indiana, we'll cut you in a minute.  I mean, no one has a swing at night.  You know what I mean?  So, but this is the thing.  If you do all that stuff, and then you cannot please this segment right here, and then you 
[03:04:00]  go too far over here, you can't please this segment.  But then, but see, the thing is, I've had a trick in that I've been able to do everything.  Everybody hates Chris.  They're like, oh, boy, you're a black father.  We love you.  And then I can go do idiocracy and be the black president that's just crazy.  And then you can go do white chicks.  God damn, you are working.  And then now, with this Expendables, it's about the whole action movie genre.  And literally, this thing is the dream of my life.  I always wanted to run with the gun. 
[03:04:30]  I always wanted to work with real, real tough cats like Randy.  This has got to be the greatest movie set of all.  Just, let's be honest, man.  I was watching the trailer of Who's In It.  Theoretically, I would say you are the toughest dude on the set.  Now, in reality, who's second?  And who'd you give that look to?  Like, you know what?  I'm going to taste you. 
[03:05:00]  Because I know you want to taste.  Like, who's the guy that really is a Dolph or is it Jet Li who you go, you know what?  I'll fuck you up, man.  I think Dolph is probably the only other guy that's really had any combative sports.  He's a fighter, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking Dolph Lundgren's a fucking fighter, man.  He had his trainer there, a Bulgarian cat that he did.  He's still a martial arts guy?  Yeah, he's still training.  Can you take him?  We never got to hook up.  Yeah, that means, yeah.  Wait a minute.  But you fucking, you wanted to taste him. 
[03:05:30]  Come on, Randy.  You wanted to fucking taste him, though.  Just to go really, really fucking Ivan Drago.  I'll bump up, but I'll punch you right in the fucking mouth right now.  No, no, no.  I was trying to start fights on the set.  I would bump somebody.  Hey, man.  Dolph said something about you, dog.  Hey, Jet Li over there.  He looking at you, man.  You know, I wanted to see something break off.  Was it a prison feel?  Meaning, like, did it get manly?  Meaning that thing where you go, you felt a little tension, like, this is not.  And I never felt that. 
[03:06:00]  Well, you never felt that because you don't care.  Like, if something jumped off, it's like, fuck you.  Time to smile and go.  Just choke out Stallone and hear him just.  No, but everybody on this set had nothing to prove.  You know what I'm saying?  That's the thing.  Like, nobody had to prove they were tough, you know, prove that they'd done something.  You know, everybody had their scars, and my lip was all broke up and scarred up.  Everybody had their thing. 
[03:06:30]  Like Jaws and shit, where it's like, this one here, BJ Penn.  Yeah, right there, right there, and fucking, yeah.  That's how it was.  Right.  When you say that, I would agree.  Y'all get along?  Absolutely.  You guys get along?  That's my man.  That's my man.  We were in the trenches together.  I'll tell you why you get along, too.  Because you guys are doing the tour together.  The guys that got along are doing the tour.  So, fucking Dolph is probably with fucking Jason Statham.  Both of them look like they swim, and they're fucking from England, or wherever the fuck 
[03:07:00]  they're from.  So, they're doing their shit together.  Stallone and fucking Schwarzenegger.  The European side.  Yeah.  Everybody kind of twisted off into, right, right, right, right, right, right.  I bet you that shit is, it looks like it's going to be good, too.  How big is Schwarzenegger's part in it?  Because they're actually making a big deal, because he's finally doing a film again.  Well, I think the biggest thing is that those three, Bruce Willis, Schwarzenegger, and Stallone,  have never been on film together in the same movie, ever.  And they're three huge actions.  Who's the last one?  Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Bruce O'Connor.  Right.  I mean, three huge action stars in the same scene. 
[03:07:30]  But now they have to come together like LeBron James, Dwayne, like Chris Bosh.  I don't know.  Three things.  It's who have to come together.  Holy shit.  What's that you got to do to make a movie now, though?  I mean, all movies are like that right now.  You know, freaking Sex and the City, you got to team up.  I would love to see you guys have knocked the shit out of those chicks.  That would have been a great movie.  I tell you, right, you put both of those movies in the multiplex, you're going to have a baby. 
[03:08:00]  You know what I mean?  You're going to have a baby.  It's like Expendables and Sex and the City.  Yeah.  Well, you could have thrown a saddle on Sarah Jessica Parker and ridden her around.  Randy, what was that last movie you did?  What was the movie you did?  The last movie you did.  Red Belt.  Red Belt.  Good movie.  I didn't mind Red Belt at all.  With Chewatel.  Akeem Olajuwon.  What's his name?  How you pronounce it?  Chewatel.  Chewatel.  I refuse to even figure out.  Some motherfucker better have a nickname at some point.  I'm not going to pronounce your African name exactly. 
[03:08:30]  Really?  You got to keep your African name Chewatel?  With all these fucking Jews around, he got to keep Chewatel?  Change that name to Chewy Johnson, motherfucker, for you to get a job.  He's fucking getting his jobs.  Yeah, he did a great job.  But you did something else, too.  Red Belt and then something else right before it.  Scorpion King 2.  That's the one.  That's the one.  That's the first one I saw you in.  Yeah, that was fun.  And then fucking Soul Plane was the first movie.  Yeah. 
[03:09:00]  Your first movie.  No, Friday after next.  Right.  And it was a big-ass role, too.  Huge.  God, you've been on a fucking run.  Oh, it's crazy.  And you took the father from fucking Everybody Hates Chris from me.  Yeah.  I fucking read for that.  God damn it.  And now you're another father.  I know.  I have something.  But Chris Rock said you fucked it up.  Fuck him.  Chris Rock really said that, Terry.  Fuck him, man.  Took the juice right through his face that he fucked it up. 
[03:09:30]  We've heard a lot of Patrice.  So you had it to lose?  Is that what happened?  Yup.  No.  Yup.  Look it, man.  It ain't even...  Look.  It was just...  I don't know what it is.  Me and Chris are both comics.  And I...  It's that kind of...  I don't know what it is, but that motherfucker.  He could have made me the uncle or something.  With all the guest stars y'all had on that fucking show.  We had a lot of stars.  Ricky Harris was on it.  Give me a fucking...  Can I get in there?  Oh, dude.  Everybody.  I fucking actually know you.  Motherfucka's like, I know you from Battle Dome.  Right. 
[03:10:00]  Shit.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm taking everything, though.  I'm taking...  Dude, you are working.  When I saw the Ice Cube thing, I just went like this with the hands in there and hit my...  What the fuck is Terry Crews doing?  I'm taking all they're giving right now.  And that's just...  It's a blessing, man.  It ain't...  It's a blessing for you.  No.  You hear what happens when people say it's a blessing?  Nigga, it ain't a blessing for me.  I'm watching you like...  And it's not even...  It's just you go, wow. 
[03:10:30]  You see that...  I don't know what it is.  And I think the thing that's going to make you super duper star is when you finally play...  You have to play black gangster somehow.  You have to be evil.  You've been a good guy too long now.  I did a movie last year with Gerard Butler called Gamer where I was straight evil and all that stuff.  But nobody saw it.  That was...  I was going to say that.  That's the only little stickler.  But like a menace to society, when you...  The evil...  The bad guys is what always pops you off. 
[03:11:00]  And I'm thinking a bad guy for you too.  You've been...  But you've been bad guys.  But you've been the...  Kind of the bad guy in Scorpion King.  Yeah.  You were, but you...  But it was the PG-13 sword and sandal.  And they make you...  Randy Couture all the time too.  It's like they make you...  Remember how Tura Tanaka used to be when you see Professor Tura Tanaka?  And it's like he's the invincible dude that...  Right.  You got to play somebody fucking just a bad motherfucker that talks a lot. 
[03:11:30]  And you...  That kills somebody and talks a lot.  Yeah.  And then it's like fucking Terry Crews day.  Because it's still...  You're still somehow bubbling underneath.  And you just want to see that explosion where you go, that's the fucking one.  And you go, damn.  Let me tell you.  I'm not in a hurry.  So that's another thing too.  I ain't trying to rush it.  Again, I got...  Everything I've got has been...  Repeat business.  It's crazy.  Because, you know, I work with Chris Rock and Longest Yard.  Boom.  You know, here come...  Everybody hates Chris.  Same thing with Ice Cube. 
[03:12:00]  Friday after next.  Here comes, you know, Are We There Yet?  Everything is about longevity and just keeping it going.  Relationships.  Stallone plucked me out.  I was the fourth choice.  Remember that...  Listen, they went to Wesley.  But Wesley couldn't leave the country.  Then he went to like Forrest Whitaker.  Oh, you did the swear out in Canada or something or...  No, we did in Brazil.  We shot in Brazil.  You shot in Brazil?  Yeah, we shot in Brazil.  Was your wife and family there?  No.  Did you stay in a hotel all night?  Yes, I did.  Yeah, you had better hat.  How about you, Randy?  I bet you went out there with your wife so she could kick a fucking... 
[03:12:30]  What's her name?  Cyborg's ass?  Fucking Chris Cyborg.  Fucking...  Yeah.  Jesus.  These guys know a little bit about Brazil is what Patrice is getting at.  Yeah.  Now, I'm saying, did you...  They know the underbelly of Brazil.  Did you...  Was your wife there with you?  I'm out married.  Divorced.  Since the last time you got divorced from her?  Yeah.  So you really enjoy Brazil?  Yeah.  We were busy, dude.  I was there for a week of the three-week shoot in Brazil and we were rocking the whole time. 
[03:13:00]  So...  But you've been there a million times because of training, right?  You must have been there.  First time there.  You've never been to Brazil doing the whole going there with the fucking jiu-jitsu thing?  Did they know you there?  The Brazilians, did they recognize you?  Yes.  Why do they did?  He's huge in Brazil.  Dude.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, that whole mixed martial arts is as big as NFL over there and this  dude is like, you know, that's LeBron James of Brazil, right?  MMA guys are getting a lot of acting work, too.  Like Rampage is getting work and you've done a few films.  It's like, they're smart because they know that that's what everybody under 21 is watching 
[03:13:30]  mixed martial arts.  They're going to go see you guys.  And they're legitimately tough.  They're not...  Yeah.  It's like, Randy's legitimate.  You can watch him in a movie and you just go, this feels good because you can, you just  legitimately...  Who did, who's the biker, the Hell's Angel who knocked it?  Tough fucking guy, man.  Oh, uh...  Oh, God.  We all...  Zito?  Yeah, Chuck.  Who did he knock out or hit in the bathroom?  It was...  It was knocked off...  Jean-Claude Van Damme.  Yeah.  Like, I think people kind of saw that as like, oh, wow, man, these guys aren't as tough,  but you guys are. 
[03:14:00]  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Like, the mixed martial arts...  Well, you're not going to write.  You're not going to say shit.  He's sitting on the set and he's just smirking at you sideways.  Like, yeah, buddy.  I could kill you.  I could kill you.  What a comfort zone.  Now, I didn't ask you this before, but do you say to yourself, for real, do you say,  God damn, I can fight?  Like, is there any point where you just go, fuck, I'm...  I can beat someone's ass.  I don't think you really analyze it that way when you're in it.  I mean, you're just doing what you do, and I'm having a blast. 
[03:14:30]  I enjoy the competition.  I enjoy the training.  It's kind of like...  How about to a square, though?  Like, to a square guy who's not in a...  Meaning, if somebody who's not in the UFC and they bump into you and you just go, wow.  Like, if it was a regular dude, regular muscles, just tough guy.  And I always say, it's like, you can't beat a dude that knows how to fight.  You can be tough, but it's like, wow.  You can look at a guy and go, wow.  He's standing in a way where I can break his leg or something.  And would you question him, like, would you say to him, look, man, look, I know how to fight. 
[03:15:00]  You're going to get hurt.  Don't get hurt.  Like, are you...  Do you have to let a person who's a square in the street know that you are legitimately dangerous?  Do you have to let them know?  I've never found myself in that situation.  I don't know.  I mean...  But my hands are registered weapons.  Is that true?  Is that fucking true?  He has a piece of paper in his pocket right now. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, I've had to lie so far.  A fucking pamphlet.  If shit goes down and you end up in a court of law, you've got not a leg to stand on.  Right, right.  With my background.  I would just have to...  So it is like a thing where...  Your life had better been threatened or whoever you're with has better...  Just have YouTube videos on your phone and show the guy that wants to fight you and go,  look, this is me, asshole.  Why do you fucking choke the life out of some asshole?  I know those are uncomfortable questions, but really tough dudes. 
[03:16:00]  You know, they got this thing called no homo.  You go, no homo.  But it's like really tough dudes.  We used to have a question.  We grew up and go, okay, how much anger do you need to have been able to fight Mike Tyson?  And it's like, you know, you go levels, smack your mother anger.  Like if Tyson smacked your mama, do you think you can muster enough anger to, you know what I mean?  To fight him.  So it's like you just tough, tough dudes.  And when you say tough, legitimately fight for fun, you know? 
[03:16:30]  That's why the questions, man.  And I know it's like kind of uncomfortable, but it's like motherfuckers that fight for real are like superheroes, man.  Most of the guys I know that find themselves in that situation, when you're in a bar or whatever,  and the guy makes the offhand, you ain't so big.  I think I could take you.  They're going to smile.  They're going to laugh that shit off.  They're not, you know, they got nothing to prove,  and they're not going to take that step to that guy and say, what?  They're just going to let that go. 
[03:17:00]  See, I'm the friend that you don't want to have with you because I go, no, you can't.  I'm smacking your face.  You really would be like the big mouth girl and shit.  I really am.  I'm a chick.  I'm an ugly chick.  My best friend can beat up your best friend.  We throw the first punch.  Let me go, Randy.  Get off me.  Get off me, Randy.  Yeah, let me go.  Let me ask you a question.  Because they're saying we have to wrap up.  When BJ Penn was in here, he put me in an arm bar for a second. 
[03:17:30]  I could have probably went a little bit, but I tapped just to.  But what kind of a move could you put me in?  Not to hurt me, but to show me.  I want to see what something feels like that I've never.  Have you been choked?  No, don't choke.  Yeah, go for the choke.  I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.  You're not going to be able to choke him out because his neck.  You're not going to be able to find his neck.  He's got too karate.  You can choke him out.  No, his neck will press against the back of his spine before he...  All right, could you show me how that's done, but then I will tap very quickly. 
[03:18:00]  No, no, I won't choke you out.  Okay, thanks.  But I'll definitely...  Oh, yeah, no, I just...  And by the way, James Toney, is this...  Are you going to...  It's on.  Are you going to...  Yeah, August 28th.  Are you going to go out to fuck him up?  Are you going to teach him a lesson, or is it just regular, regular?  It's a fight.  You've got to take it seriously.  I mean, the guy's a world champion boxer.  He must be shit-talking.  I haven't seen any promos yet.  Is he talking shit?  Oh, he's good at talking shit.  If you start losing the fight, just say fuck the fight.  Just attack him and break his leg and take the loss on the technicality. 
[03:18:30]  Are you shooting right away?  I don't know if you've given away a plan, but you must be shooting right away.  Yeah, there's no secret there.  This is a mixed martial arts competition.  Okay.  He's taking him down.  Take the boxer.  Oh, it's mixed martial arts.  You're not just boxing.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Now, you remember I like you a lot, right?  You know that.  Ray Mercer made that shit stop with Tim Silver.  That is no more of that shit.  That was supposed to be a boxing match, and they wouldn't sanction it, so they had to  do an MMA match, and there was supposed to be a gentleman's agreement that he wasn't 
[03:19:00]  going to kick.  The first thing Tim did was walk out and kicked Ray, and Ray's like, oh, yeah, and dropped  him like a bad habit.  Wow.  Don't get knocked out by James Donnie, please.  Oh, thanks for the mojo there.  I'm just saying.  It's a weird day.  Fucking fatal loss.  It's kind of weird.  You just don't want to.  It's just kind of a weird day.  Hey, I'm taking it very seriously.  He's going to be dangerous, especially early in the fight.  He's an explosive, very good striker, and I've got to do my best to make sure he doesn't 
[03:19:30]  land one.  Wow.  All right, now choke Jimmy.  Choke Jimmy.  Well, let's phrase this properly.  We're just demonstrating on how a move would be done.  You ever choke a clam?  Use that technique.  All right.  Now, what's the proper way to...  Hold on.  Physiologically, your carotid arteries are right here.  Oh, fuck.  There's two kinds of choke.  There's a blood choke, which is you're cutting off the blood supply.  There's a wind choke.  Wind chokes are actually very painful.  You don't want it again.  Okay.  It's super cool.  It's crushing his trachea. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  And eventually he'll pass out because there's no oxygen, but it's a much slower way.  It's a death blow.  You know how humiliating it is?  He's controlling me with his finger right now.  You know why?  He's checking to see if you're done.  Oh, God.  What was the bicep on one carotid and my forearm on the other?  Oh, God.  And now if I apply...  Wow.  That was it?  That was it right there?  Wow.  You made a sound?  He peed.  He didn't hurt me.  That's pee on his leg.  How do you fucking get these guys who fight for... 
[03:20:30]  He made a sound like...  When Fado got choked, he fought a long time.  And he was a choke with his legs.  Triangle choke is a blood choke.  He applied the pressure.  Wow.  That's effective.  Can you do that again?  You can't...  You can't...  Don't start jerking off, Norm.  No, no, I'm not...  No.  Here comes the poop.  No.  Done.  Wow.  You can't...  There's nothing you're going to do to get out of that.  Nope.  If you're me.  Wow.  That's fucking great.  Holy shit.  So if a guy has you like that, you've got the same carotid artery. 
[03:21:00]  My chin down.  But you still can fight it.  Yeah.  Because he's giving me his neck and letting me put it on.  But is that what you guys are avoiding?  That's the end game right there.  Once he gets it sunk in that deep, in real competition, in real time, I'm going to fight  and keep him out of getting it that deep.  That's what Jimmy can't do is put his chin down and need one.  Immediately.  It's over.  And so when Brock got Carwin, what was being crushed there? 
[03:21:30]  His carotid artery?  Oh, good.  A bicep on one and his own shoulder on the other.  Oh, his own shoulder was choking.  Okay.  Okay.  And if you don't really like a motherfucker, you go for the fucking one at the trachea.  Yeah.  That's, I don't like you very much.  Oh, damn.  That's your not breathing.  And you never really see that.  You don't see it because it's guys like each other, basically.  You know how embarrassing that would be if my girlfriend saw me that happened like  in a bar if I shit-talked you and you did it in front of my chick?  How fucking humiliating that would be?  In a split second, you're just like, wow.  Fucking wow.  Oh, she's a whore. 
[03:22:00]  I'm sorry.  Wow.  So, Jimmy, were you just like fucking...  I'm an actor.  Did you realize...  I need more makeup.  Terry's like, eh, don't...  My makeup, please.  Thank you.  I just want to know if, Norton, did you know you were like, you would pass out?  It was a weird feeling.  It was almost like instinct kicks in and my hand...  There's nothing I could have done to stop my hand from going, tap.  Nothing.  Nothing.  I know at that moment, like, there's... 
[03:22:30]  Because I can't fight, but there's nothing you can do.  Yes.  Again, there's nothing...  Because he's a lot stronger than me, obviously.  But once you're in that pit, there's nothing.  By the way, there was a girl on YouTube that lasted about 10 seconds longer than you did.  She actually...  Hey, she actually wouldn't tap, you fucking sister.  That's the difference.  She said, I'm going to take it like a goddamn man, you fucking worm.  Hey, you know what?  He just...  All he did was place his thumb knuckle and Norton's like, oh, I feel it.  No, fuck you.  That's about that.  Salmon-necked motherfucker. 
[03:23:00]  The girl took it.  Yeah, but she didn't have Randy Couture doing it.  Fuck, she did have Randy.  It was her.  Yeah, bitch.  That's what I just said.  She wanted to be choked out.  No, she choked out.  She went out.  So, Jimmy, why don't you try the last 10 seconds?  She wanted to go to sleep.  Oh, I don't want to go to sleep.  No.  Some women like submissions.  Exactly.  Some women like submissions.  Exactly.  Got real men don't like submissions.  Yeah, real men don't like submissions.  You tap out. 
[03:23:30]  We got to get them out of here.  Real men do this right away.  I feel it.  All right, we'll take a break.  We got to wrap it up.  Yeah.  We got to get the plug out.  Thank you, guys.  We got the plug out in theaters August 13th.  Terry Crews and, of course, Randy Couture.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you for having us, man.  It had to be.  They're not going to talk about it, though.  Pretty good show today.  I want to thank Patrice O'Neal for sitting in.  Oh, hell yeah.  I want to thank Jimmy for coming back from Montreal to do about an hour of radio today.  Of course.  On his birthday. 
[03:24:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  What's going on here?  The show's ending?  A little bit.  We're getting close to wrapping up.  Yeah, 15 minutes.  I don't want to go.  Terry Crews.  I'm lonely.  He's a good guy.  He's a very nice guy.  Lonely.  Real good guy.  I'm lonely.  You're lonely?  I don't feel like going.  What are you leaving?  Well, you come back.  Jimmy's out a lot.  Yeah, I'm going to do.  I'm doing Leno Wednesday.  Are you in tomorrow?  Yes.  In tomorrow.  Out Wednesday.  Wednesday, Thursday.  Come do Wednesday.  I might do Comic Con or I might cancel.  You don't want to do Wednesday?  I'm leaving.  Where are you going, baby?  You're not.  I'm going to Miami.  This weekend. 
[03:24:30]  When do you leave?  Wednesday.  So I can do early morning radio in Miami.  On Thursday.  Doing the improv.  Hmm?  I don't drop a shit in the improv.  White acts don't do that well there, too.  It's a very black Spanish market.  I do good in Fort Lauderdale, but Miami, I do.  Don't fucking...  Stop marginalizing the fucking club because you don't do well.  I'm saying you'll do well.  Why'd you make it racial?  Because I'm saying it's...  Shit.  Everyone who knows anything...  Why does you have a black audience?  No, no, but it's not even insulting.  Or some black.  In Miami, it's not typically...  Most white acts don't do that well there because it's mostly a Latino and black market. 
[03:25:00]  That's not an insult.  No, it's true.  Norton, you know what?  As a black...  I love Norton.  Yes, you do.  But...  As a black man...  There's a butt in there.  Yeah, there's a butt.  But as a black person that doesn't know Norton, he has the face where you are not allowed  to really enjoy him as a black person.  Right.  No regular black person would go...  You're right.  To enjoy that face.  That's why I don't do black audiences.  You're right.  That's exactly why.  Just because of his face?  He's right.  He has a face.  What could he do to fix that? 
[03:25:30]  Nothing.  I mean, I'm telling you, his chin, his chin, just for his own fucking own aesthetics, but  it's nothing he can really do to...  Blacks don't like chinless faces?  He's just such a little white boy.  Yeah.  And that's all it is.  It's racial.  Isn't it funny?  It's racial.  Huh?  Shouldn't it be funny?  Fuck it.  I go to Minnesota and offend the three people that come see me.  Minnesota, you don't do well enough.  If I say anything that's just not about Minnesota, and even if it was about Minnesota, I'm 300 
[03:26:00]  some odd pounds of black guy who ain't happy.  If I smile, I might get over, but it's just not a happy thing.  So again, I don't know, but it might be racial, but in the middle of the country, it's just...  Yeah, they're just looking at you like, motherfucker.  Yeah, like...  Goddamn, I told you.  If I get a little arrogant or a little...  If I fuck with some white woman, it's like uppity.  Oh, uppity nigger shit.  Richie, Marilyn, if you're lonely, go stick around and do Ron and Fez today. 
[03:26:30]  There you go.  I don't know.  Why are you looking at me weird?  I don't know.  I don't know what to say.  I didn't say...  Why is weird just looking at you?  It was a weird look.  You're not going to set me up.  You would do...  It wasn't even a setup, to be honest.  I didn't look too weird.  You would do good radio with Ronnie.  I think Ron should be talked about as one of the best radio people ever in history.  He's fantastic.  Ever.  I've never been invited.  Yeah, I never...  I mean, that's why I don't go.  You feel self-conscious.  You don't just walk in.  I've never been invited to do a show.  But that's how he is, though. 
[03:27:00]  You just walk in and then...  I know, but you feel silly.  I don't know...  Ronnie's the type of guy that will drop everything if one of you guys walked in the door.  He wouldn't give a shit.  If I heard that from him, I don't fucking...  That's how he does it.  I don't know.  That's how he does it.  If all of a sudden he sees you, he would drop everything and hang out with you for an hour.  Easy.  I think he...  I think he interviewed me for something I did on XM.  Oh, what?  The Unmasked?  Yeah.  I think he...  I think he...  That fucking...  To be one of the great radio people ever, just in terms of his knowledge, he's great.  I think he's great.  Unmasked should be on TV? 
[03:27:30]  It should be.  Easily.  Yeah.  But it's, again, I think he's too...  Easily.  Like we were talking about, you would hope there's a market for people who just kind of...  That's a no-brainer thing, though.  Kind of tell it.  I don't know why that's not on TV.  Someone should pick that up in a second.  But he should be on TV.  Everybody should be.  You should be on TV.  Everyone should just be on TV.  Everyone here that comes through, I would think.  We don't want to play with their fucking rules.  But you hear what Terry said, though.  And I don't disagree, man. 
[03:28:00]  He plays the game a little bit, right?  People like him, man.  And that's not a knock.  It's just like, fuck.  I wish I had to learn how to be likable to everybody.  You need likability.  We didn't even talk about the Old Spice commercials with Terry Crews.  That's the big one right now.  With the abdominals.  They're fucking...  Those things are viral.  As viral as you could get, those damn things.  And he probably is making most of his money from that.  You think?  Yeah, a national like that?  Fuck yeah.  Probably.  All the money he's making, he's probably...  Where he's at in this game, on TBS, probably have to take a little lower. 
[03:28:30]  On this show on TBS, and Everybody Hates Chris, I bet you on Everybody Hates Chris, he was the star of the show.  But he wasn't a big name.  I bet you he makes a very non-aggressive five figures around the 20s, an episode, I would think.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  About 20s.  High to low.  And then on this one, since it's TBS, but he still has a big name, I bet you he makes... 
[03:29:00]  You know, non-aggressive five.  About 30.  I bet he makes 35.  How much is he worth right now?  He probably has about three in the bank, I bet you.  Three Gs?  No, I don't know.  Three Gs.  Yeah, a bunch of iPhones.  And he's a family man, and he had a show on BET with his wife, and she kind of got it together a little bit.  I don't know if he's a family man.  I think he's just scared to leave his wife.  Why?  He says she's from Gary, Indiana, and she would cut you. 
[03:29:30]  So he's probably just scared to leave.  He's only saying that shit to say it.  He's not leaving.  He loves you.  He's been with her a long time.  And she's been with him in the lean years.  They've been together forever.  So it's like you have to be a little, you know, you have to be loyal, man.  You have to be loyal.  Girl has been around during the fucking years where you ain't shit.  Then when you pop.  And he pop.  He's popping.  Popping.  He's more than popping.  Well, he's still, look it.  He's bubbling still?  A lot of white people.  You ain't popped until white people know your name. 
[03:30:00]  And I bet you the thing that most white people know is the old Spice commercial.  Of course.  Oh, he's old with the muscles coming in?  Of course.  But it's like black people, he's pretty much a household name in black world.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  He's big in black world.  In white world, he's probably still, he's the fucking.  He's got to catch on name-wise.  Yeah.  Who's the white equivalent to Terry Crews?  Maybe a tough question.  That's known in the white world and not as much in black world.  That's a fucking.  That might be a tough question.  Yeah, that's a. 
[03:30:30]  But I'm saying who should be.  Gary Oldman.  I bet you.  To the average black person that might watch Friday.  You go, Gary Oldman.  You go, who that?  Oh, you know the motherfucker played Commissioner Gordon?  Oh, that motherfucker.  He's.  But if you're a fan of movies, you know him from professional, you know.  There's certain people that, you know.  True romance.  That should know.  True romance.  He's, you know what I mean?  Gary Oldman is probably not known by as many black people as you should be.  Because he's so white. 
[03:31:00]  You know, he's so white.  He was in JFK.  He played Oswald.  He's a genius.  Did he?  Yes, he was Oswald in JFK.  I didn't know about that.  I didn't know he was British until I heard him interview.  Brad Pitt is famous and Denzel Washington is famous.  Anybody.  Across the board.  Across the board.  Everybody knows that.  All right.  What else we got?  Oh, E-Rock's got the noise you made when you got choked out by Randy Kinsley.  Just for the radio, it didn't.  Oh, it's good enough.  I want to hear that.  Here it is. 
[03:31:30]  E-Rock's panicking.  Are you panicking?  Is that a look of panic?  I think so.  E-Rock's head's getting bigger and his face is getting smaller.  Fucking guy's starting to look like a.  It's like he's being blown up on a bicycle pump from the back.  What a great visual.  You see those guys.  Their head gets bigger, but their face gets smaller.  His features are disappearing.  He's just like one of those things where you put a big one in a little one and then a little one in another little one.  He's a fucking Russian fucking balloon face. 
[03:32:00]  His head is turning into a black hole.  It's collapsing on itself.  He really makes me sick.  That's E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  I'm getting fed up with E-Rock.  I say hello to him every morning.  I'm just looking at him and struggling.  But E-Rock's lucky.  I don't think anyone will Photoshop you on those little Russian fucking.  You don't have that to worry about E-Rock.  Don't worry about it.  Backable Russian.  And the other thing.  I love the other thing.  I'm just saying.  And I noticed it because he's just sitting there and he's under pressure to do something.  Yeah, he's freaking out.  And his little baby features are just. 
[03:32:30]  Someone's saying it's not Terry Crews and the new ads.  What?  They changed the old Spice guy?  There's two different ad campaigns.  Yes.  All right.

[03:38:30]  and we spent the weekend some nice fucking hard alternative dick you motherfucker i did i did i  give her some powerful nerd cops you say take this jake johansson yeah that's exactly what i did  give a little jake johansson and a dash of oswald i said that twice yeah i said  but then okay a week later she uh she moved to la that was a little creepy wow a week later she's  like i'm here i moved here and she goes but not for you but not for you and then it was one of those 
[03:39:00]  things that's what happened she texted me like 49 times i told her you're a fucking stalker leave me  alone i've had and she said why don't you fuck me why don't you fuck me over and over again like  40 times to one text like if i held it up to you and you wanted i said this is what crazy looks like  then like the 50th text was a picture of her pussy so i was like i got to rethink this and yeah but  here's the this is a true story two texts later the guy who was building my bookshelf sent me a text  of the bookshelf he was building i was more excited about that i thought to myself you know this is  something i'll have to be afraid to put my you know something into so i and it might last so i got the 
[03:39:30]  bookshelf and the chick now and i and she's coming out here tonight i'm a little how long have you  been sitter because i remember you telling me a few months i it's been a it's i lose touch with that  shit but it's been a few months and it's really good and it's really fucking crazy and i and i thought  all that anger and weirdness in me was gone but it's all right there apparently that's how i court  that's how i i yell at a girl until she cries a few times and if she can take it we're in we're gonna  go for a while you look better than you did in your 95 hbl special holy shit are we gonna fuck after this 
[03:40:00]  i just can't believe because here's my fear he looks so much healthier uh now than than when  he if you say he's on top of his game comedically or whatever is relevant right he looks it's like  i'm sitting here going am i going to mark maron myself and and and feel and look better but  but be traveling around doing a fucking podcast which is what we don't want to be doing but it's he's  happy happiness the world is into a a shitty joke you were starting to an insult on me 
[03:40:30]  no no it's i'm being very sincere i can't believe he's ahead of all of us that's the  the world is going toward the podcast i'm telling you he's uh he's he's the leader right but it's but  it's the fight the early fight of trying to get to this place where we think we want to be yeah  yeah and then you're realizing you're never going to get there and you better settle for something  and you better fucking be happy no bullshit i know it sounds insulting but i'm just being trying 
[03:41:00]  to be honest about it realizing your limitations is a grown-up moment well look uh we'll get mark  in tomorrow or the next day we'll figure it out great uh the podcast where can they hear it wtfpod.com  i think uh what's up there today there's some good ones up there i did dane your buddy dane came on  and i was an asshole to him like yeah why did you think you had to be i did what else am i gonna do  being a fucking what else am i gonna do why are you being the fucking the the martyr or the the  nemesis to dane for these fucking young douchebags these douchebags i wasn't the nemesis i wasn't the 
[03:41:30]  nemesis i just didn't know it because you have to talk to him i'm telling you i'm not mad at dane  you know why a lot of i'm not mad at him because i fucking know him yeah and i talked to him and i  know that motherfucker what he's doing is honest he does not want to do fucking pain comedy that  digs he don't right he's not deep and he's not interesting i agree  honestly it's like dane is just the go-to name but he's a funnier honestly he's a funnier guy than 
[03:42:00]  people give up than comedians i have absolutely nothing again so i didn't go into it with any i  didn't vilify him i don't care about the stealing thing i don't care about you know what people think  he's a hack or whatever you really are a slick white guy listen to me listen to me listen to me  patrice this is very good man all i'm saying is that when i i just thought that he had a lot of  charisma not a lot of depth and when i listened to him i thought like well i guess people like it he's 
[03:42:30]  filling arenas but i'm not that interested but he wanted to come on and and i was going to talk to  him and i was a little defensive i just quit nicotine that day and also i just didn't i i felt like he  was just giving me patter you know i want to have a conversation but you know what only people who are  finished in the business give you the the interview that you're looking for that you're hoping for yeah  dane can't give you a fucking we we see that a lot patrice is making a pretty good point can't say  anything the guys that have a lot strength the guys that have a lot to lose don't don't give up 
[03:43:00]  like politicians they're like politicians yeah dane got too many people who don't understand truth  that's fans of his he can't go out there and say and say the truth fucked up shit he can't yeah  that he just makes good point we've seen a lot on this show we really do yeah i think that's what  frustrated me is that like i felt like i was getting stock stuff and i wanted him to cry and i just  couldn't you wanted you wanted you might have got more out of him if he knew you better too sometimes  people are much more likely to open up if they know a guy like they feel if i wasn't a dick i was kind 
[03:43:30]  of a dick and quite frankly you are i will say as we're you know mark maron we all talk and there's a lot  of guys who spawn a lot of comedy children where you say that these guys are stealing from this guy  right stealing his essence i tell how that maron has in the top uh probably in the top five a lot  of mark children a lot of children you think maron has a lot of famous children too oh can you write 
[03:44:00]  one down uh really help me out or do you want to just fucking say it you're pretty honest the big  the name that then this is the streets all right mark you don't have to acknowledge that you even  hear this this is the streets right patten is it is a mark maron baby well that's the streets  that's the streets okay i love patten let me say that i love patten patten never speaks bad but  i'm talking about the streets talking is colin quinn has a lot of babies out there who's the number one  that has the most big dave attell attell okay yeah he has the most children walking around 
[03:44:30]  i tell todd and head this day what tell todd and head which is the which todd berry and headberg  todd berry has but not on the tells level headberg a lot headberg a lot a lot yeah i tell a lot and  the question and it might be and i know it's posthumously the doctor people the streets say that  uh uh is headberg headberg is a is a is a tell baby really yeah you slow it down a little bit 
[03:45:00]  and yeah yeah i know it's possible thinking was so different than it tells it was more of a steven  right thing yeah his thinking was so where he went for a joke a laid-back company man like he was so  fucking beatnik kind of indifferent than attell attell is uh uh it's a pacing guys steal like  and his out there-ness with that yeah but maron maron is a lot of children out there a lot of 
[03:45:30]  babies no i was hoping they're having a better time with it than i am they are they fucking because  they take a little bit of the actual you yeah and make it more accessible to these fucking people  so they just give a little bit and it's like wow he's he's crazy but he's not crazy he's not  gonna hurt us how did you and dane end the interview it went okay he ended up really  wanting me to like him and he ended up uh you know inviting me to his house for fourth of july  and sending me a present i felt kind of guy he's not a bad guy dude it's like he really gets it  he gets a bad rap from comics because he's right like in a way comedians think we're supposed to 
[03:46:00]  feel a certain way and i guess i know him before he hit i didn't feel that but he's actually a nice  dude there's nothing wrong can i ask you guys because uh how much of that is uh jealousy  the day and i'm not saying you three in the room in particular but oh the whole fucking  people's issue how many people fucking beat them up because they're actually just if there's a hundred  people jealousy look because you got to go guys who are really upset who who want to say something 
[03:46:30]  who thinks comedy is about saying something out of a hundred it's 10 of them the rest 90 is jealous  just motherfuckers i'm not saying it's seeing that you guys are saying you know mark is saying i  only get jealous of people that are like me i don't i don't get jealous of people that i got  nothing to do with i i mean right i've never understood the contempt against him because it  just didn't register that was real content that really wasn't a shot at any of you guys i'm just  talking in general the comedy world the content the content is the content is dane made it on a on 
[03:47:00]  this perception of uh of a of a plan that everybody thinks was like that's the contingency plan which  is like i'm going to be famous by doing youtube facebook myspace and um it did not happen that way  so it becomes oh he's only doing he probably licked somebody's ass so it's like these guys who emulate  and want to be famous that blueprint of fame they follow the blueprint and then they realize oh shit  dude he hit the social network there is really early yes he did really early that's right it's 
[03:47:30]  not easy to do what dane did but he got in real early russell peters is the only guy the other guy  that did it that way early but to hold on to it i mean the thing is it's like anyone can do that but  to actually you know maintain a career after you do that i mean that's the trick i mean you get these  guys in last comic standing or whatever they're good for a year but i mean to maintain a following and  maintain a business yeah i mean that's the trick and you can't manufacture lightning in a bottle 
[03:48:00]  there's no blueprint i mean fuck it's who the hell knows who's gonna hit for what reason now you're not  a big fan of his but what do you respect about him what do i respect about him did i say i did  if anything no if anything that's how you know that he repeated your question because he's like  he's like oh boy am i gonna say something he's he got mel gibson what i'm turning the podcast on  mark maron i know i know anything you respect about him i respect his discipline if anything  you got to respect a guy's work ethic that i find that most guys who get real famous and hold on to 
[03:48:30]  a career they work their asses off and and i as a guy who doesn't you know necessarily work his ass  off i've after i've talked to a lot of these cats who have money and have fame the one thing they do  is they work fucking hard and so you know if there's anything i can respect it's that because  i certainly don't have that good answer man you answered it fuck you're gonna say  very fair all right well mark maron's gonna come in tomorrow wednesday patrice you're off to miami  the miami improv this weekend i thought we'd see you another day we got no jimmy all week i i would  i would just love to i'm i'm just i'm unless you want to just come in tomorrow i don't know i'm lonely
