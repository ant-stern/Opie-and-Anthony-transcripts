<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a nonsensical, apocalyptic monologue, quickly transitioning into sexually suggestive banter and jokes.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, discussed their online community, PalTalk, and the recurring "Panty Party" segment. Norton recounted an embarrassing incident involving his girlfriend and his “Uncle Paul” persona.  They then launched "Your Morning Bad News with Club Soda Kenny," featuring their security guard delivering morbid news.

A significant portion focused on Tracy Morgan's DUI arrest and the insensitive media coverage, followed by a discussion of "Whip Em Out Wednesday" and the use of "WOW" stickers.  Michael Richards' racial slur incident and Monique's reaction were heavily mocked, with the hosts criticizing her hypocrisy and speculating on celebrity motivations.  The "Bimbo Summit" (Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and Paris Hilton) was discussed, focusing on Britney's photos and attempts to recapture her sex symbol status, accompanied by numerous sexually explicit comments.  A caller, Kenny, commented on Britney's toes.  The discussion then veered to violent video games (Grand Theft Auto) and their purported link to violent behavior, seguing into a bathroom anecdote about a coworker’s bowel movement.

The show moved on to a critique of Tyra Banks and her show, highlighting her self-absorbed personality with examples from segments like her "panty party." Clips were played, showcasing her focus on lingerie and undergarment care.  Joe Namath called in, discussing his career, book, and the NFL. The conversation briefly touched upon celebrities appearing in nude magazines and the annual eggnog challenge.

A substantial segment mocked deaf newswoman Karen Meyer, with numerous crude jokes about her ears. The hosts debated banning the N-word from entertainment, referencing *True Romance* and *Do the Right Thing*.  They also discussed violent video games, a Judge Mathis ruling about accessibility for the blind (prompting further offensive jokes), the upcoming eggnog drinking contest, and announced Joe Rogan as a future guest. A caller detailed their constipation experience graphically.  The segment concluded with a description of a nearby movie filming and details about the cast.  A blind listener, Krista, was also described in sexually suggestive terms.

Further calls featured more crude jokes about Karen Meyer's ears.  In-studio, Flea, a participant in the eggnog drinking contest, was ridiculed for his milk and buttermilk consumption.  Uncle Paul's creepy comments about children were highlighted. A rap song mocking Michael Richards’ racist rant was played and discussed.  The conversation became sexually suggestive and offensive, involving Uncle Paul and a female guest.  Flea’s drinking contest and interactions with the female guest and Uncle Paul continued.

The show then devolved into increasingly vulgar and sexually explicit challenges involving a blind guest, a female caller ("BTM"), and the hosts.  The focus was on forcing the blind guest to describe the caller’s genitals and the caller simulating sexual acts with a dildo, culminating in simulated fellatio.  The hosts pressured the blind guest to touch the caller's breasts and buttocks, highlighting the caller's discomfort.  Concurrently, Flea was pressured to allow the hosts to record his bowel movements.  The bizarre story of “Sergeant Magoo” consuming Froot Loops from a bucket of vomit on Paltalk was also mentioned.

The broadcast concluded with a plan to break into Minnelli's house and burn his clothes, followed by further discussion of "WOW" stickers and their uses, including a graphic description of anal injury from using them for hair removal.  Finally, there were promotional announcements for the show's website, sponsors (including Bodog), and listener polls on iliketolisten.com.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  It's an epidemic.  One goes in, millions come out.  Every cell is dead.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  What's into the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection.  It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with their pure rage. 
[00:00:30]  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee.  Opie.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing. 
[00:01:00]  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S.  It's the Opie and...  I hate you. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's.  Come on, you Bucksotics.  Wake up, all Bucksotics.  Panty party!  Woo!  Panty party!  I'll do it!  Finally!  Titanic Bucksotic.  Panty party!  Woo!  Yeah!  Panty party, you dummy.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning!  Hi.  Hi.  You're about to check out the Opie and Anthony show.  About to?  It's in progress as we speak.  Well, yeah.  Hmm, that's a lot.  Panty party!  Woo!  Panty party!  Bimbo Summit!  Bimbo Summit.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:02:30]  Wake up.  It's time to have some fun.  Where's Opan 2?  Where's Opan 2?  My God, we can't do the show without Camera 2.  We have PalTalk cameras and stuff.  For all you people out there who are not watching on your computer,  if you're home with your computer,  you could watch what the very handsome individuals in the studio are doing.  What dopey men.  Yeah.  My camera focused on Jimmy Norton.  You see my Breathe Right strip, which I wear?  Really awful.  And you know what a treat it is to watch everybody on this show go into that bathroom. 
[00:03:00]  Because I leave the bathroom door in frame.  Just so people can go and then people can comment,  ooh, look, Opie's going to the bathroom.  Do they really do that?  Yeah, of course they do.  Can we have a bathroom cam?  I'd love one.  Put in there?  It would be hilarious.  Where would it have to be?  Just like from the chest up, just so you can see the faces you're making.  That would be hilarious.  All right, we'll have to work on that.  Why don't we get a day in the near future where we have bathroom cam? 
[00:03:30]  Bathroom cam for the pal talkers.  For the pal talkers out there, yes.  Sounds good.  Very hot.  How many people are on pal talk?  Hundreds?  Yeah, hundreds at any given moment.  At any given moment.  At any time of the day or night.  Yeah, this is like a lifestyle.  We talk about that from time to time.  The Opie and Anthony show, yeah, we go off the air eventually.  We do about, I don't know, 12 hours of radio a day for eight different companies.  Something like that.  And then when that's finally over, the fans just haven't had enough.  And they continue in the pal talker rooms. 
[00:04:00]  Last night I was in one of the pal talker rooms, the fan room.  A little glass of wine, a little pal talk, and then the other half of the screen, online poker.  And a little chat with the people, a little talking, a little poker, a little wine, other people drinking what they're drinking.  It's fun.  It's a little community right there.  And it never ends.  No, it never ends.  All night long.  All night long.  Goes on and on and on.  Hey, Bill from Waterford, right off the bat on the instant feedback. 
[00:04:30]  Hey, guys, is Uncle Paul in studio for Tyra's Panty Party?  Panty Party!  Oh, Tyra.  Jesus.  Oh, lovely Gail.  Gail.  Gail.  Oh, is that frightening?  Just briefly.  I was doing, my girlfriend and I, my girlfriend embarrasses me publicly.  And she's one of the very few people that can embarrass me.  Which I find so refreshing because Jimmy does nothing but embarrass everybody he's with in public. 
[00:05:00]  It's just brutal.  If you're on an elevator, he's going to let one loose.  Nice and loud and he just doesn't care.  You're walking down the sidewalk.  Airports.  How about that?  Where he's talked too loud because his iPod's up too high, guy.  No, it's guy who doesn't know his headphones.  He's talking too loud because his headphones are on, guy.  Yeah.  I say guy twice.  So his headphones are on and he's just yelling,  Where's the baggage carousel for our flight? 
[00:05:30]  Is it this one?  And everyone's looking and he's got big dopey headphones on and you're walking 20 steps ahead of him because he's embarrassing and he's yelling at you.  Well, slow down.  Yeah, I want to go get some coffee.  You want thirsty?  You want coffee?  Coffee?  Because I'm thinking it's a latte.  Really annoying.  I was thinking about that this morning because we're flying down to West Palm Beach on Friday.  Yeah.  We are.  And it's going to be nothing but embarrassment from old Jimmy Norton.  So it's refreshing that your girlfriend is taking it and turning it around on you. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, she does stuff.  It's really, really awful.  Like, things like, all right, all right, all right, all right, stop, just stop, just stop, just stop.  Oh, you get, you get embarrassed.  Good.  Yeah, yeah.  Join the club, idiot.  You get, she's nonstop.  She won't stop until you're embarrassed.  It's just, I don't know if I love her or if she's mentally ill.  Like, so I started doing this character to her, which creeped her out.  And I didn't realize it creeped her out.  We did talk about this on XM yesterday so that the guys know about it.  And I called him Uncle Paul. 
[00:06:30]  And I don't know why I creeped her out.  But I would talk to her like that and tell her that she was a good little girl.  I used to babysit her.  She used to bounce on my knee when she was wearing little bikini undershorts.  And she's, I guess, I don't know what it does, but she said it gave her the, she's like, you got to stop with that.  It really creeps me out, like on a real level.  So, of course, you do it nonstop.  The closer to her ear I can be, the happier.  What's better than creeping your girlfriend out?  There's nothing better.  That is great.  There's nothing better than when you can whisper something awful. 
[00:07:00]  Like, I remember when you was 11 and your body started changing.  Remember how confused you was?  It just, it doesn't, how does she react?  Does she smack you?  She's like, oh, she backs off like in a really creeped out version.  So now her, now her, now she's trying, her way to beat that is to flirt back.  Oh, okay.  She flirts back.  Oh, she's now flirting with Uncle Paul.  Yeah, but it's not going to last.  I see you, I see you winning.  Yeah, you're going to win that battle. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, although she won yesterday on the street.  Because I was, we went to see Citizen Copeland.  We're walking home and I'm doing a little Uncle Paul.  And then she starts doing loud tourist guide lady, talking about the streets of Manhattan.  And I'm like, all right, you shut up.  People are looking at us.  Oh, it was the most irritating thing.  I love this.  Oh, yeah.  That's exactly how we feel when you do it to us.  Like, shut up, Jimmy.  Yes, stop.  It's embarrassing.  Not only is everyone looking at us, someone's going to punch us.  No, it's really, it was really awful.  So I kind of.  Good for her. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, Uncle Paul had to settle down last night.  The beauty of Uncle Paul, because I was listening to the show.  You know, they do the replays all day long on XM.  And wow, it is creepy.  Yeah, because it doesn't sound like Jimmy.  At all.  No.  Usually when someone does an impression, you can listen really closely.  You can kind of hear the person's voice that's doing the impression just a little bit.  Just enough to go, oh, okay.  Yeah.  But with that, it truly sounds like there's a different person in the studio.  I will actually say, and I will confess, that is a rip-off of an old thing I used to do, 
[00:08:30]  of my own thing, where my one girlfriend, I would creep out years ago, and I did the  character called Uncle Larry, who was.  It's always an uncle, isn't it?  Yeah, he was very thin-lipped and talked like that, and his mouth was very small, and he  was also used to babysitter, you know.  Uncle Larry.  That was like what I would do, and it really would creep her out.  But this is more than Uncle Paul.  No, I like Uncle Paul.  I do, too.  You're a ghoul.  Uncle Larry was the child's version.  That was kids.  That was Play-Doh.  Well, so I guess we'll hear from Uncle Paul as the morning progresses. 
[00:09:00]  I believe it has something to do with Jim Norton's multiple personalities that he has.  It could.  In that body.  Also, I think we may have come up with a new bit today.  We're going to try it for the first time.  It's your morning bad news with Club Soda Kenny.  Everyone needs a little dose of bad news in the morning.  For the new listeners, Club Soda Kenny, just, I don't know.  He revels in bad news.  But I've got to explain why he's even around.  He's our security, and he takes care of everything, including, like, travel plans and getting food and making sure we get to the station on time and safely. 
[00:09:30]  And then he helps us with the walk from here to exam.  He just does all this stuff.  He's a personal assistant road manager.  Slash dummy.  Slash ghoul.  Slash vampire.  And, you know, we all noticed this.  But finally, I think Jimmy brought it to everyone's attention that he's just a bearer of bad news.  Because we all would hear this stuff, but we didn't share it with each other. 
[00:10:00]  And he loves it.  And finally, I think Jimmy, like, kind of, you know, started.  And then we're all like, oh, my God, he does that to you, too?  Yeah.  I've been watching it for years.  Kenny, I met when he was Dice's road manager, and I opened for Andrew.  So I saw Kenny in many states.  He would just – Kenny does this thing where he doesn't make eye contact with you.  Like, his eyes open wider.  And if anyone has seen Club Store to Kenny, he's just a big kook.  And he's, like, 6'5", and he has dry hair, and he just stares straight ahead.  He's an ex-cop.  He gives away nothing when he talks to you.  He must have been a real bastard of an interrogator because he gives away no – 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  You don't even know it's a human.  I'm sure phone books weren't involved.  Of course they were.  And he just would look and go, look, I don't want to be the one to tell you this.  But internally, he wants nothing more than to be the one to tell you this.  And he was legendary for upsetting Dice, for upsetting me, and anybody he could upset with bad news.  And he doesn't lie.  I mean, he makes things up.  He just tells you the truth.  But he has no bedside manner at all.  No bedside manner.  He stinks.  He just loves it. 
[00:11:00]  So we're just going to go to the local papers here in New York.  And actually, we'll check out, like, the Chicago Sun-Times and the Boston Herald and some of the other newspapers.  And there are horrible stories everywhere.  Yeah.  If you could help us out with some of these horrible stories for – what is it going to be called?  Your Morning Bad News with Club Soda Candy?  I think Morning Bad News, yeah.  Maybe the listeners can help us out with a name for the bit on Instant Feedback.  It's a very, very interactive radio show, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Which means we don't like to do certain things we would like you to do for us. 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  We just want to sit here.  Get busy.  So a little later this morning, because Kenny is doing one of his jobs right now, and I believe that's getting Jim Norton some egg whites.  No, no egg whites.  They're doing something in my system.  I'm going to have cereal now.  Because normally, I'm Ralph regular.  And, you know, for the last couple of days, it's been awful.  Yeah.  No, I haven't sat in two days.  Are you a little tamped down, a little backed up?  It's horrible.  Yeah.  I sneezed.  I was wiping chocolate pudding off the counter. 
[00:12:00]  I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but Tracy Morgan was arrested again.  Yeah.  You know, I tell you guys, drinking and driving.  I was a cop.  I know.  We can spot these things.  But then he'll throw in some other facts.  Like, I saw him the other night.  He'd been drinking all day then, too.  I was like, well, then where were you then?  No one's going to suck him out the bit.  We're going to have to pipe in to make it a good bit.  Oh, because he's such an unfunny ass.  Right.  A monotone ass. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  So we're going to have to, I think we're going to have to jazz it up.  Here's a nice smiling picture of our friend Tracy Morgan on 30 Rock.  And he was in the other day, and here he is smiling in the post with his white sweater.  And, man, busted again.  Yeah.  You know, why bring race into it?  Anybody can wear that sweater, Jimmy.  You don't have to call it a white sweater.  Oh, no, no, no.  Here we go.  This is a sweater for white men.  Oh, just for white people.  All right.  It's a gentleman's sweater.  If that's what it is, what more am I to say?  What page? 
[00:13:00]  Is it the post or the news?  It's page nine, and it's chock full of awful, awful reporter writing.  Oh, I know.  I was reading it before, and it's just all puns.  Well, it starts off by saying, not so funny, man, Tracy Morgan.  First of all, Tracy Morgan is hilarious.  He must not have been funny when they were arresting him.  Was caught stinking drunk behind the wheel in upper Manhattan yesterday, earning his  second misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated. 
[00:13:30]  Third time's a charm, you know.  What, second one in 11 months, I guess, right?  Wow, wait a minute.  I didn't even read this editorializing bitch.  Laura Italiano of the Post.  And then she goes, the comedian who got more snores than laughs on Saturday Night Live?  What?  What are you talking about?  The guy was on there for years.  He was on there for years, you dumb bitch.  And had some very memorable characters.  She's obviously thinking of Tim Meadows.  She's got her black comedians.  Oh, maybe that's it. 
[00:14:00]  What a dummy.  What a dummy.  The nerve of her to judge anybody else's comedic talent when she's trying to be funny,  and this cornball crap she is writing.  The Post has the corniest writers.  Just print the news.  Yeah.  Don't try to be funny with it.  You're not good writers.  If you're good writers, you work for the Times.  You don't, and you're not.  Well, you've got to give him credit, though, man.  He blew a .126.  That's it, boy.  That's nice.  If you're going to be pulled over for DWI, you might as well take it over the top. 
[00:14:30]  He currently plays a drunk, washed-up comic on 30 Rock.  Is she implying that that's what he is?  Once taken to the 20th Precinct, the stand-up comic was falling down drunk.  See, stand-up.  Arr, arr, arr.  Manhattan prosecutor's charge.  He gave an allegedly stumbling, unsteady performance during his coordination test.  Arr, arr, arr, arr.  That ties in with his job.  Oh, that's terrific.  That's good.  Oh, boy. 
[00:15:00]  Did he blurt out the N-word?  He started pointing and yelling.  He realized it was a mirror.  Why am I saying that?  Oh, God.  Do I hate when these reporters try to be funny.  Well, we're going to try to get him on the phone this morning.  He was heckled by the breathalyzer when he blew a .126.  All right, well.  Well above the .08.  Remember when it was a one?  One.  Make it a one.  Make it a one. 
[00:15:30]  It used to be a sport.  Right.  I don't know.  Drunk driving is quite a problem, guys.  I hate to be the hole on this show, but.  Oh, my goodness.  Shut up.  Are you saying drunk driving could be dangerous?  From now on, my name on the show is Rita Reasonable.  It's the Rita Reasonable hour.  I'm going to chime in with all the things that you boys shouldn't be talking about.  All right.  We'll have more on that story as the morning goes as well.  And finally, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Oh, my God, it is.  I was talking to some of the big wigs this, I don't know, a couple days ago. 
[00:16:00]  Were they actually giant wigs that are in rooms and offices?  You walk in and a giant, like, oldie-style English wig is in the chair.  Just a big Mardi Gras head.  Or are they fat people from a defunct political party?  Of the wigs.  Big wigs.  That would be W-H-I-G.  Of the wig.  Right?  Yeah.  Big wigs.  Yeah, they're all like judges from 1720.  Those faggoty white things.  Someone was suggesting that we... 
[00:16:30]  Or are they just fat black people and they got a letter wrong?  All these things are just a mystery to me.  I don't want to upset you, but Jack Pound's died and Korea's testing nukes again.  You know?  You know I told them.  Right.  People are writing in their sad, their bad news stories.  He'll tie it.  You know, you might not want to hear this, but most people wear wigs because they have cancer. 
[00:17:00]  But someone was suggesting that we don't explain Whip Em Out Wednesday good enough.  Are you kidding me?  We don't.  Are you kidding me?  It's the easiest concept ever, ever.  And the greatest radio promotion ever.  Because everyone can play.  Everyone can play.  Yeah.  You just throw a WOW sticker or a WOW sign or write it in the dirt on your car or truck.  WOW stands for Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[00:17:30]  Exactly.  Unless you're Britney Spears, then it's Whip It Out Wednesday.  Bimbo Summit coming up on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you just throw a WOW on there somehow.  I've seen it in the dirt on the back of the trucks.  WOW stickers starting to pop up a lot more these days.  Well, WCKG just got their WOW stickers up there in Chicago.  Very, very excited that the WOW stickers.  God, we've only been at this, what, six or seven months, they finally got their WOW stickers.  And the ones in San Francisco, they could fit ten on the head of a pin. 
[00:18:00]  It's amazing.  Oh, they just don't want to commit in San Francisco.  A little postage stamp.  It's really interesting when you get to do a syndicated radio show.  You get the feel and the personalities of each city.  Yeah.  San Francisco just doesn't want to commit to anything.  Make the sticker bigger.  They just want to make everybody happy.  So they want to make the perverts that are into Whip Him Out Wednesday happy by having the WOW sticker.  But they don't want to piss off the women's group so the sticker's really small.  Small. 
[00:18:30]  So maybe they won't notice.  It's the smallest WOW sticker we've ever seen.  It's awful.  It's an eyepatch.  There's no reason for it.  I think it's maybe slightly bigger than a dollar bill.  Yeah.  And the WOW sticker is around America, especially here in New York City, much bigger than that.  Yeah, they stand out.  You can see them from blocks away.  So you throw the WOW in your car, and there are ladies out there.  Maybe a few will call us this morning.  They kind of just look for WOW stickers, and they will flash you.  Yeah.  They will flash you. 
[00:19:00]  Pull up next to you.  Shirt goes up.  Boof.  There you go.  You get your nice tough commute home.  You get a nice little treat.  Right.  And I think you can go to opiananthony.com to figure out how to get your WOW stickers, okay?  Yeah.  But it is Whip Him Out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Let's give it the big plug here.  Right.  Get a WOW on the vehicle.  For detailed instructions on how to get your very own WOW sticker, visit opiananthony.com.

One of these days you'd be driving, a girl that's familiar with the program is going to see the WOW, know what it means, pull up next to you, and flash you.  It makes that commute so much better.

[00:20:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This week on the Razzle Dazzle Variety Show, it's the worst of the walk.  Who knew you could screw up putting one foot in front of the other?  So fire up that listening thread on your favorite message board and get ready to complain about something.  It's the Razzle Dazzle Variety Show, Saturday mornings at 6 a.m. Eastern, with replays throughout the weekend.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Kramer story. 
[00:20:30]  Doesn't go away.  It's a quickie.  It's kind of interesting to follow these really, really big stories when they hit and just see how it unravels.  Yeah.  You know, it's a very serious thing.  Michael Richards yelling and screaming, the N-word.  N.  At the Laugh Factory in L.A.  He's been banned from the club and he's on an apology tour and, you know.  Just a mess. 
[00:21:00]  You get the celebrities coming out of the woodwork because, you know, they're jumping on this to get their own exposure.  That's all this is about.  People see an opportunity to get publicity for themselves.  Indeed.  Indeed.  You know, at first, you got Paul Mooney, who obviously wrote for Richard Pryor and is a comedian in his own right for many, many years.  So he has a lot of experience with the N-word in comedy.  And then you got Paul Rodriguez, who happened to be at the club.  So, yes, you want his point of view. 
[00:21:30]  Now it's come down to Monique, who has nothing to do with this except for the fact that she's black.  Big fat Monique.  Ew.  From, uh...  But this is what makes these things interesting.  Showtime at the Apollo.  Didn't she host that?  I don't know.  She's hosting some...  I don't know.  Some fat woman show.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a fat...  A show for fat women to make them beautiful, but not to make them lose weight.  You know, just to say that you're fat and you're a beautiful girl. 
[00:22:00]  Just to make them feel better about themselves.  Big beautiful woman, BBW.  Yeah.  You're big.  There's more of you to love.  She gets on stage.  I watch Showtime at the Apollo after SNL.  And she comes out and she is wearing just a tent every time she comes out.  It's a huge...  More material.  It could clothe ten normal-sized people.  And she comes out and does a little turn and goes,  What do you think, people?  And the place goes wild. 
[00:22:30]  And she smiles and goes,  I know I look good.  But can someone be honest with that mess and tell her she doesn't?  You don't look good.  A walrus.  There's a small percentage of guys out there that find fat women attractive.  Just want to throw fish into her mouth.  Just watch her.  They're afraid of being left.  Those guys, those chubby chasers are afraid of being left.  And they want to be hugged and smothered by mother's love.  Mother.  It's a mother.  Mother's love. 
[00:23:00]  Chubby chasers have a mother issue.  Show me one fat pig doing the news and I'll buy the validity of no...  There's no size discrimination.  You never see a big fatty doing the news.  Why?  Hey.  Al Roker.  As long as she's pretty on the inside.  Exactly.  If she has a beautiful personality, she could do the news and we wouldn't even notice.  What a pretty heart.  Right.  And lard wrapped around it.  She's lovely on the inside.  What a pretty clogged intestine she has.  Well, out of nowhere, Monique had to pipe in about the Michael Richards thing. 
[00:23:30]  Of course she did.  And watch as the days go on.  I mean, you're going to see more celebrities coming out of the woodwork.  Oh.  Going, wow, I can get my face and my name in the news here.  And they're just going to get lower and lower on the celebrity scale.  Absolutely.  So here's Monique from The Insider last night.  I will no longer watch that show.  I won't purchase any DVDs.  And people will say, well, it's not the whole cast.  I understand that.  But he's a part of that.  So for me, I can't support that. 
[00:24:00]  We are no funny.  You stupid bitch.  How self-righteous.  Self-righteous and stupid.  It makes no sense.  What guilt by association, you ass?  She's being an idiot.  That's boycott, let's see, one member of a basketball team, let's say, rapes a woman.  Oh, yeah.  Let me think.  That's probably never happened. 
[00:24:30]  But how about you boycott the entire team?  Yeah.  You don't go to see a game.  You don't go to – because rape is horrible.  So why would you support a team, even though it's not the whole team, but he's a part of it.  So don't support the team at all.  You dummy.  So she can't watch Seinfeld anymore because of Michael Richards and what he did.  Jerry and Larry David need any more cash.  Jesus Christ.  But what did Jerry do?  But Jerry did nothing.  By the way, season seven is selling like hotcakes, Jimmy. 
[00:25:00]  Hotcakes are always big sellers, I was told.  Or like Johnny Cakes if you're staying at a bed and breakfast.  It's a nice alternative to what?  Deliciousness?  Fruit with a bad foot?  Yeah, it looks like something that you remember being delicious.  A pancake.  But it tastes like gravel.  First of all, when I say at the bed and breakfast, he made me those corn cakes.  And he goes – they're like made out of corn products, which is corn and creamed corn.  Creamed corn is disgusting. 
[00:25:30]  It really is bad.  It's disgusting.  It's pre-chewed corn is what it is.  Let's call it what it is.  A machine chews it for you.  It looks like corn they eat on a porn set.  There's no reason for it.  Worse vegetable.  Worse vegetable.  Harry Schiavo.  End of discussion.  Back to Monique.  So far we learn here that she can't watch Seinfeld because of what happened with Kramer, 
[00:26:00]  which is just completely ridiculous.  Stop it.  She continues on her little rant.  In between eating.  And that was –  Oh, she knows funny.  She's going to tell her.  Oh, she knows funny.  We all know funny.  And that wasn't.  Monique says she can't erase those hurtful words from her memory.  Try with some anthemins.  Angry.  Hungry.  Because that went somewhere else.  That wasn't comedy.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:26:30]  I'm Richard Pryor.  My favorite comedian ever.  My idol as a kid and through adulthood.  I love Pryor.  Love him.  But if you want to get into something like that, Richard Pryor was arrested for battery  of his wife, I think he was maddering six times.  I mean, if you want to talk about things – like, am I supposed to not like Pryor because  he shot at his car and had to be arrested because he was – he shot his wife's car  while she was home or he threatened his wife with a pistol?  Well, why would you still love Pryor considering the abominable things he did in his personal  life and yet boycott Michael Richards when all he did was say bad things? 
[00:27:00]  You understand?  I mean, come on.  Stop it.  Get over it.  She's just seeking attention.  That's awesome.  And a lot of people are in agreement here.  She's not breaking any new ground here as far as being over the top, inappropriate, or  whatever you want to call it.  Yeah, we know.  No, he lost his mind on that stage.  Everyone saw it.  No one's sitting there going, oh, what?  He was doing a great bit of comedy.  It wasn't funny. 
[00:27:30]  It was – he lost his mind.  We know that.  But then to boycott Seinfeld, oof, good luck, by the way.  It's played 80 times a day, all of – and I watch every single one.  You better pull your TV out of the wall and throw it out the window.  Just don't watch TV because you're going to –  You're going to be going around the channels while you're shoving bonbons in that fat maw  of yours, and you're going to come across Seinfeld.  What are you going to do then?  Oh, she's going to be in turmoil with that remote control. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, it's on again.  You're going to sit there, and you're going to go, oh, this is the first one.  This is the one where they're in a Chinese restaurant.  I might just watch this one.  Crayman ain't in it.  She's just going to watch the pilot.  Monique, no one's following your boycott, by the way.  No one cares.  This is not Selma in 1965, you jackass.  He's making his mea culpa.  He's apologizing.  Let it go.  Oh, she said something.  I don't know if it's in this clip that, yeah, she apologized – he apologized, but he had  to because he got caught. 
[00:28:30]  Yes, that's true.  Why does anybody apologize?  Do you apologize for cheating before you're busted?  Oops.  Got me.  Honey, sorry.  Let's smell this.  I don't know why I did it.  Yeah, why would he apologize if – yeah, exactly.  Here's just a perfect example of how this works because usually you don't see somebody  groveling to this extent and apologizing.  Usually something happens racially.  The lawyer gets involved.  A statement is put out.  You rarely hear from the actual person, and the situation goes away. 
[00:29:00]  It dissolves.  They demand an apology.  It never really happens, and the situation goes away.  Now, Michael Richards couldn't stop apologizing.  The guy's got dystopia apology flying out of his mouth on multiple shows, and you see  now what that gets you.  It gets you in a worse position.  Well, if you're an adult like he is and has no talking ability, people might have thought,  well, you didn't realize that your mouth opened and just dreck came out of it.  Why couldn't Larry David have written an apology for him?  It probably would have been hysterical, funny. 
[00:29:30]  You know, I'd like to know –  A little pratfall he could have done in the middle of it.  I'd like to know why the black community didn't boycott Mike Tyson when he was not only accused  of rape, he was convicted of rape.  And I don't remember one person of the black community saying, I'm not going to his fight  because of that.  I don't remember – and that was a behavior.  That wasn't just yelling.  I want to remember not one person –  Not one person in the white community either.  Of course, absolutely. 
[00:30:00]  No.  Absolutely not.  Why wouldn't you?  I'd love watching that guy.  Please, I'd love him more.  Living crap out of people.  That's what he should do.  Of course he should.  Your job is to punch people in the face.  Why should she be any different?  A little snotty beauty contestant.  Hey, we're talking about Kramer.  E-Rock, I want to play that rap song over here.  Tell – yes.  Oh, boy.  I know.  Did you hear that?  Whoa.  Whoa.  Whoa.  E-Rock just went, whoa.  Tell the boys here over at Free FM to grow a set and let us play this stupid rap song  that is all over the internet. 
[00:30:30]  It's viral at this point.  Good luck.  Keep up your good nature.  You don't think it's going to happen?  No.  We played it at XM and we got rave reviews on it and the feedback was unbelievable.  It has the N-word in it.  It has the N-word in it.  But it's from his actual dialogue there.  It's from his taped performance at the Laugh Factory.  Diatripe.  Go bring it there.  Diatripe.  Go bring it to Al and see if we can play it.  What do you think, Al?  What do you think, Al?  Okay.  Can this make it through Al? 
[00:31:00]  Al.  Okay.  Al, hit the dump button.  Al, for any new listeners, is our dump guy.  He sits down the hall and hits a little button which stops you from hearing certain dirty words  which will get us in trouble.  One, unfortunately, is the N-word.  Yeah.  So whenever you think we're in commercial, that's just us being dumped out of as we scream  and and and and and and and and and and and and so this might have to go over al's head  but we want to play this thing because uh yeah run it past now 
[00:31:30]  okay pookie play the kramer's song i can almost do that one too  what do you say al  we're a bunch of asses all right here's uh monique a little more from her  That was so ugly, because there are people in my family, in my family tree, that's been hung up to a tree with a fork stuck in them. 
[00:32:00]  What?  Because they were black.  Holy cow.  Stop it.  How the hell do you know?  Who hung your relatives with a fork in them, stupid?  Yeah, let's challenge her on that.  Please.  Dude, I don't even know who my great-grandfather was.  I know.  Stop, Monique.  I was thinking about that the other day.  I don't know his name.  I don't know what he did.  I don't know where he lived.  Yeah.  I would assume somewhere in Queens.  Yeah, I know nothing.  Yeah, I was thinking about that the other day.  I know nothing about my family past my parents. 
[00:32:30]  But she knows about her family tree going all the way back to slavery.  Slavery days.  And a fork?  I'd challenge her on that.  Where did Kramer pull that fork thing out of nowhere?  I think it was like a sight gag, you know, of the mind, where he conjured up an awful image.  Probably looked down at somebody eating, saw a fork, and decided that was what he was going  to use in his mind in this scenario that he pulled up.  And she's saying that that actually happened? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  That someone from her family, her ancestry, was hung in a tree and a fork was used?  Yeah, let's continue with the clip.  Stuck in there simply because they were black.  Not even a public apology can help Monique, but he has Michael.  If Michael Richards went on the highest mountain and said, I'm sorry, I believe you're sorry  because you got caught.  It would be very cold.  You're sorry because you got caught.  That's just how it works.  How would he be able to apologize on the top of Mount Everest, by the way?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  First, how would he get there?  I don't think he's in shape to do the climb.  A surfer would get up there.  Yeah, but still, you got to be in, like, really good shape.  I don't think Kramer can make the climb.  Nope.  I think the lack of oxygen would get to him.  I was going to say, the apology would have to be very quick because you can only last a certain amount of time.  How long do people stay on the summit?  They get to the summit, they go, wow, the summit, and then they have to get right down.  Does anyone have enough time, especially in the stupid, slow Shatner delivery that he's been giving these apologies,  to actually apologize from the altitude that airliners fly? 
[00:34:00]  No.  I don't think so either.  She's just being silly.  He would have to be a speed reader to read his apology.  Yeah.  And Monique still, still wouldn't accept it.  Frost-bitten toes, probably.  Probably Kramer toes just having to be cut off when he gets back.  I'd like to see Monique climb a mountain.  She is a mountain.  I would like to see her.  Let's see Kramer climb Monique.  I would like to see her climb a little hill.  Mount stupid.  Oh, what a... 
[00:34:30]  Just throwing her fat face into the mix.  That's what I'm saying.  Why do you need attention?  This has nothing...  I'm a black...  We know it.  We know it.  But this is my new favorite thing because they're coming out of the woodwork.  Let's see who comes out of the woodwork next.  Is that a new saying people are saying?  Stick a fork in me, I'm black.  All right.  So we do know who my great aunt is.  Yes.  Yes, Jeff.  All the way May.  We do know that Obie's great aunt was all the way May from A League of Their Own.  She was the actual all the way May. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And she's now a nun.  But we all know what all the way May went through.  Right.  Who empathizes with Michael Richards because during sex, she yells the same things that  he yells on stage.  Leave my great aunt alone.  Leave her alone.  One black on one end, one white on the other, just showing what the races can do together.  They can fill all the way May.  She was about unity.  Madonna played my great aunt.  Beat that. 
[00:35:30]  Beat that.  Um...  I can't.  Nope.  Nope.  Oh, okay.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  My family, they're Irish, and they brought ice cream to Jersey City, the Pierce's.  Are you kidding?  My grandmother told me that with pride, and I had to unball my fist and walk away.  It was awful.  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  My grandma used to talk about how the Iceman would come to town, and they would get a lick.  They'd get to lick the ice.  Hopefully, they met Richard Kuklinski as he was showing up to kill someone.  The Iceman.  I thought it may be Val Kilmer's character in Top Gun.  And the Iceman would come and clinch his teeth in a towel.  Five cents a lick back in the day.  Wow.  You know, that might sound like a lot of money.  Oh.  Oh, Uncle Paul, yeah?  If a kid's got a buck, he can get 20 licks. 
[00:36:30]  Creep.  Even though it only takes three.  Tree?  Tree.  Yeah.  Don't you love those stories?  And we used to, yeah, we didn't have television, and the Iceman would come, and he'd have to walk up five flights with a big block of ice.  Wow.  Sounds great.  Yeah.  Where's my video gaming system?  Hey, where's my Wii?  Too good to pass up someone from their cell phone.  I bet if he wrote the apology down and stuck it to a cheesecake, she would accept that. 
[00:37:00]  And Steven from Bayshore, always good for a few every morning.  Madonna played your great aunt, so did half the Negro League.  Oh.  That's not nice.  Oh, that is not very nice.  No.  She'd paint a home plate on her stomach, and they would run and slide in face first.  He's safe.  All the way, May.  All the way, May.  Boy, what had to happen that drove her into the nunnery? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, what a bad back she must have.  Easy.  Just got, she finally had enough where she had to actually become a nun.  Rumor has it Babe Ruth was impressed with her hitting back in the day.  I bet.  I bet you all the way, May, was one time in the backseat of a vehicle, and somebody was treating her like such a pig.  Hey, hey, hey, that's my great aunt!  That, actually, you heard, poof, poof, as the back tires blew out, because all the way, May, was being caved in. 
[00:38:00]  The old shocks on the Studebaker couldn't take it.  They had a picture of all the way, May, in the New York Post.  Yeah?  I think right around the time we got back on radio.  I gotta find it.  I'll bring it in so we can get it up on the website.  Was she a looker?  Dude, she's in her nun...  Was she a looker back in the all the way May days?  I have no idea.  She looks like an old lady.  She's in her nun habit, her nun habitat, whatever it's called.  Habit. 
[00:38:30]  Habit, and she has a baseball bat in her hand, and she's like 95 years old.  She's actually showing exactly how far she got it.  And think of what must have been banging her, because the truth of the matter is every healthy, able-bodied man was at war.  Every black guy back then looked like Yafit Kodo or Mike Epps, and that's what all the way May was.  Right, that and retards that couldn't get into the army.  All right, they're searching for all the way May pictures. 
[00:39:00]  I gotta see all the way May.  All right, listen, I wasn't sure, so it's a Sherpa, not a Sherpa, right?  A Sherpa.  Sherpa, I said Sherpa.  Oh, did you?  Sorry, Jared.  Sherpaco.  He exposed all the crookedness in the Sherpa community.  Fontaine, what's up?  It's time for Norton and Friends.  Jimmy, you are amazing.  Oh, thank you.  Fontaine loves you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Fontaine.  I do indeed.  Guys, I'm a black listener and a big-time Monique fan. 
[00:39:30]  And I think she's the funniest chick comic ever, if there is such a thing.  I'm not following any boycott.  I just, I think, Anthony, you pegged it for what it is.  She's just trying to get that name out there, and I'd probably do the same thing.  Guilt by association is ridiculous in this case, especially.  Stop it.  Yeah, I love you guys.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's say hi to Dave in the Bronx.  Dave.  Yeah.  Sorry about Tracy, bro.  What's that?  Sorry about Tracy, man.  Well, you know, D. Wee, he still lives there.  He's still representing. 
[00:40:00]  He represents the Bronx.  You know that, Dave.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Good.  What do you got?  I just want to thank you guys for finally having the balls to say what I think everyone  should be saying about this Michael Richards thing.  I mean, why is it that, you know, the blacks can make a movie called White Chicks, and  that's not racist, but if we had a bunch of white guys, blackface, and named it Black  Chicks, oh, they would go crazy over that.  You are correct on the theme of what you're saying, but I will say that there was a movie  called Soul Man, which was a guy in blackface getting into Harvard, and plus, look, dude, 
[00:40:30]  I hate to say it, but those are done as to be funny.  Michael Richards did something to be vicious.  It is kind of different, but I've had enough of it already.  It's like he apologized, and the black community should stop using him to all of a sudden dredge  up other things that they want to talk about.  It's like, let it go.  We've had enough of the story as well, but what we're finding funny is the celebrities  that are now coming out of the woodwork to get some exposure for themselves.  So, all right, Dave, thank you.  Thank you.  Has Jimmy J.J. Walker made a statement yet?  I'm looking forward to that.  I'm sure.  I will.  Jesus. 
[00:41:00]  I'm sure that he won't say dynamite in the middle of it unless you pay him an extra thousand.  That's what I heard Jimmy Walker wants on stage.  He won't say dynamite unless you give him, like, an extra grand.  A grand?  I love that.  Yeah, good for him.  Really?  Yeah.  He's an ass.  He is, but, I mean, you know, I'm sick of saying it.  He really is an ass.  Hey, he has some projects on the back burner.  Does he?  Yeah.  Club Sotokani in the corner with his reading glasses on, getting ready to do the bad news, the bad morning  news, those are great glasses if you're wearing orthotics.  I bet they're orthopedic shoes because I wear orthotics.  Those are the only glasses you could wear. 
[00:41:30]  Like, they fit you perfectly, but on anyone else.  Oh, my God.  Where'd you get them?  Like, the pharmacy?  Did you just pull them off the rack?  Like, yeah.  Yeah.  I see good now.  All right.  We've got to do a little discussion about the Bimbo Summit.  We've got, are we almost ready for Club Sotokani?  Yes.  Oh, that means no.  No, yes, we are.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:42:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show is headed to Florida, and you're not.  Tune in to the Opie and Anthony Show Monday and Tuesday morning, December 4th and 5th,  as we broadcast from the Buzz 103 FM studios in West Palm, without you.  If you're in the West Palm area, feel free to stop by and watch the show from a safe distance.  That's Monday and Tuesday morning, December 4th and 5th, live from West Palm.  Details on opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  On this fine Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yes, Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Wow.  By the way, the wow stickers as well.  Great way to support the Opie and Anthony Show.  Great way.  I was driving all over Long Island this weekend.  I saw so many freaking wow stickers.  It was nice to see.  All over.  Nice.  And we're on a lot of radio stations.  I don't know what your radio station's doing to get you a wow sticker. 
[00:43:00]  I really don't know.  I think you can go to opieandanthony.com.  We might have some info up there, right?  I do believe we do.  But basically, you throw the wow sticker on the back of your car.  It stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Yes, there are women out there that will flash you if they see the wow sticker.  And if you don't have a wow sticker, we see the homemade wow signs all the time as well.  So get involved.  Get your wow sticker today.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:43:30]  Write that down so we don't have to say it every freaking time.  Please.  Jot it down.  It's a very interactive radio show.  Eventually, you're going to need that phone number.  1-866-313-FREE.  You'll get annoyed at some point and want to call up.  Yeah.  There were a lot of people annoyed on yesterday's show.  Oh.  And we loved it.  You get a racially charged program like that, and you're going to get calls.  Of course.  Well, we're going to try something new right now with Club Soda Kenny.  Hi, Kenny. 
[00:44:00]  Good morning.  Good morning.  That's nice.  He's also known as Derek the Dodo, if you're playing GTA Vice City Stories like I am.  Mm-hmm.  He's the star of GTA Vice City Stories.  Yes.  We're all involved with that game.  All our voices have been used on that game.  So we're going to do bad news with Kenny.  We don't have a name for this bit yet.  We're going to hone it.  We just kind of came up with it just before he went on the air today.  So we'll see what happens. 
[00:44:30]  Just because he loves being the bearer of bad news.  Yeah.  And he's got a certain style to giving bad news, unlike anyone I've ever seen.  Because he tells you he doesn't want to tell you this bad thing.  Yeah.  But he feels like it's his job to.  But like Jimmy pointed out, no, he can't wait to tell you the bad news.  There's nothing he enjoys more.  He's never seen glowing more than when delivering bad news.  Right.  He just gets a glow to them.  Usually we try out these new bits in the O.P. and Anthony lab. 
[00:45:00]  At the Institute, yeah.  At the Institute, but we figured today, what the hell, we'll just throw it on the air and  see what happens.  So without further ado, are we ready?  Do we need any more of a setup here?  No?  I don't think so.  All right.  Here's your morning bad news with Club Soda Kenny.  Good morning, everyone.  I don't mean to start your day on a bad note, but unfortunately, it's time for the morning  bad news with me, Club Soda Kenny.  Now, you know, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the U.S. dollar has plunged to 
[00:45:30]  a 15-year low on fresh signs of economic trouble.  The Federal Reserve attributed this slide to the declining housing market.  You know, I've been saying for weeks that the yen was gaining on us, but no one would  listen to me.  I'm just telling you what happened.  You know, don't shoot the messenger.  You know, I don't want to upset every, you know, the mothers of newborn babies, but a 
[00:46:00]  mother has been accused of putting her baby in a microwave.  China Arnold was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, but the case is difficult because there's  not a lot of scientific research on the effect of microwaves on human beings.  I could have told her it would have hurt the baby, but she wouldn't have listened.  You know, let alone what it did to her electric bill.  Stick to the script. 
[00:46:30]  I like that.  A little newscaster improv.  Yeah, they're doing that these days on the news.  Yeah, I didn't want to say, what, was she too lazy to shake it?  You should have.  Some are suggesting we should call this, maybe you should sit down with Claude Sotichetti.  Oh, that's a good one.  Maybe you should sit down.  And, you know, I don't know if you knew this, but the Justice Department might open a federal 
[00:47:00]  investigation into the shooting of an unarmed group of black men in Queens.  Sometimes the black community is outraged, and this is only going to make it worse.  I told them that half the cops are not whites, but it's like talking to a brick wall.  If things keep up, this could end in a riot.  You think?  No, I'd like to see that happen for this bit.  Riot.  And finally, believe it or not, but believe it, here's some good news. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, good news with Club Sotichetti.  Yeah.  Out of character.  All right.  You know, a year after doctors performed the world's first partial face transplant, doctors  say the lady is gaining more facial mobility, and the operation was a success.  Hey, there you go.  Some good news.  All right.  Yeah, but of course her immune system almost rejected the transplant twice, and there's  always the chance her body could reject it completely at any time.  And she's still pretty weird looking, if you ask me. 
[00:48:00]  Yes, she is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I hate to tell you this, but there's, you know, that's all the stories for today.  Oh, my God.  This is cold.  And just so you know, the weather is supposed to get gradually worse the rest of the week.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it'll probably thunderstorm this weekend.  And so don't say I didn't tell you so.  All right.  There it is.  Very good. 
[00:48:30]  Maybe you should sit down with Club Sotichetti.  It has potential.  It certainly does.  It definitely has potential.  She's too lazy to shake it.  There it goes.  All right.  Back to his corner.  Going to read up.  Well, you know, we spent two days on that shooting in Queens with the cops and stuff.  50 shots.  We all know the story by now.  It made national news.  But here in New York, it's time to move on.  Two days was enough for that story.  Yeah.  Front page of the New York Post. 
[00:49:00]  Bimbo Summit.  Bimbo Summit.  I didn't even know it was that time of year.  Has everyone seen the pictures of Britney Spears?  Yeah, I think they've been.  What can we say on this side?  Emailed.  We'll say a lot more later on this morning.  But what can you say on this side?  It's plump and nice.  It's plump and nice?  I guess her belly.  Because you could see that.  That must be what you're talking about, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You could see the sea scar.  She has a little plump belly.  I like it.  The sea scar stinks. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, but it's better than the other option.  It's taken a long time to heal.  Yeah, I'd rather have a sea scar.  You know, please.  Than, yeah, the old water slide.  That's, uh...  Well, she's, um...  She's trying to get publicity.  Right.  She got rid of K-Fed.  Got rid of the K-Fed.  Which people don't know, Jim Norton loves K-Fed.  How do you not love K-Fed?  Can't get enough of K-Fed.  No one can.  I'm obsessed with K-Fed.  The guy's a great rapper.  He brings it. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know what you're all thinking.  He brings it, all right.  He certainly does.  Yeah.  Yeah, wow.  Give me a K-Fed's rhymes.  I rest my case.  Well, Brittany is now single.  Of course, everyone knows that.  She's trying to get some publicity.  She's trying to get her career back intact.  So she figured the best way to do this is to get the counsel of Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton.  Wow.  And they're calling this the Bimbo Summit, where the three of these bims are hanging out in bars. 
[00:50:30]  They're chatting it up.  They're hanging with each other, trading ideas.  I'm sure Brittany got the idea of going without any underwear, underpants, and going out, and then getting out of a vehicle in a certain way that makes everything visible.  It's called the old oopsie, which was...  Whoopsie-daisy.  I think it was invented by Paris Hilton.  So Brittany Spears, you got to remember, we've seen Brittany Spears for the last two and a half years, pregnant, fat, with those really fatty Starbucks drinks. 
[00:51:00]  Yep.  She's trying to change her image back into being, you know, a piece of ass.  So she's getting her body back to get...  Wow.  That is nice.  Wow.  Old Homer mouth.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow, that mouth, that doesn't look like Homer Simpson's mouth.  Someone's got to draw, yeah, draw like Homer's face.  I've seen that before, yeah.  It hasn't been done.  It's very sexy.  It hasn't been done?  It certainly has.  Okay.  Although I don't know what's going on under Homer's mouth. 
[00:51:30]  Looks like something's happening there.  Yeah.  Right there.  Wow, well, that is a close-up.  Yeah, wow.  What is that?  Oof.  Ah.  It's almost life-size.  What is that?  I don't know.  It looks like...  If that was a car, I would say it's leaking tranny fluid.  Yeah, what is that?  I don't know.  I think we know.  Yeah?  Yeah, she probably could have waited a few days before she went for this photo op.  Oh, wow.  You think so, huh?  Maybe.  Well, the beauty of this photo is that she prepared for this photo. 
[00:52:00]  It's very obvious.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very obvious.  It was...  Hey, do we have a link to this photo on our website for the people that haven't seen this  yet?  Who hasn't seen this?  How does Britney have an awful C-section scar?  God, can't she...  Does she have no vitamin E?  God almighty.  She looks like some chick from Jersey.  Can't you fix that?  You're Britney.  Day stripper out on the island.  Looks like a day stripper scar.  Yeah, you're right, Anthony.  No wonder K-Fed got disgusted.  So, this is what's so great about this. 
[00:52:30]  So, Britney Spears needed help to turn it to a sex symbol again and get her image back.  So, she calls Paris Hilton.  Paris Hilton invented the oopsie shot, which is basically not wearing any underpants.  Yeah, I know.  But now they're going to start dumping out.  We're trying to keep it as...  Yeah.  Whatever.  So, the deal is you step out of a car not realizing what's exposed.  They get a picture of it.  You don't look like a whore.  It used to be.  Because it's an oopsie.  You didn't mean to do that.  Then everyone starts talking about it because it's just an amazing shot. 
[00:53:00]  It used to be subtle.  Where maybe they were wearing panties and, like, you'd get a little slip of the...  Maybe it would turn sideways.  You'd see a little something.  It was, like, subtle.  This is just blatant.  Yeah.  This is...  I mean, her shirt is pulled up to her belly.  Well, she prepared for the oopsie shot.  In the car.  In the car.  Here comes the oopsie shot.  When the right leg then gets out, when she turns her right leg to put it on the pavement 
[00:53:30]  out of the car, wow.  That must have looked like Hiroshima when those flash cubes went off.  Flash cubes.  Flash bolt.  What do I think?  It's 1950?  Yeah.  She's getting out to see Kong.  Yeah.  Flash cubes.  Jesus.  Jesus.  So the front page of the New York Post...  What an ass I am.  No, she was going to watch Jake LaMotta fight Marcel Sardin.  Yeah.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum. 
[00:54:00]  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Fum.  Rock Hudson wiping his mouth and vomiting.  Jimmy going old school.  Looks like all bit of hair is gone with the wind.  Wow.  Well, you know what Marilyn Monroe, someone is bringing up, she might have invented the oopsie.  I was thinking of that with that picture, yeah.  With the famous picture over the subway grate. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, but wasn't that done for a movie?  I don't know.  It was a publicity shot, but it was like, ooh, here comes my dress.  Ooh, I got to hold it down somehow.  Yeah, but she was wearing big bloomers.  Well, yeah.  Big, nasty bloomers.  What do you want to see?  Joe DiMaggio's fist print right in her stomach?  Because supper was cold?  Yes, I do.  Instead of a C-section scar, yeah, it's a nice fist print.  It's a Yankee World Championship ring print because she got mouthy while Joe was having  some laughs with Ted Williams. 
[00:55:00]  Joe and Ted having a few laughs.  Having a few laughs.  She got a little mouthy.  I want to laugh too, T.E.  Shut up.  Some Yankees are talking.  That's right.  By the way, a lot of people saying, do you think it's Photoshop?  This one is not.  No way.  This one is not.  She's seen the fake ones.  She needed to completely change her image back to being a sex symbol, and she had no choice.  She had to call up Paris Hilton and get this done.  So the front page of the post, Bimbo Summit.  Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and now Lindsay Lohan jumps into the mix as well. 
[00:55:30]  She's going to teach her the finer arts of smoking and cutting.  I think she's a cutter.  Yeah?  That's what I read the other day.  Cool.  She's a cutter.  Nice.  She's got a bunch of razor marks on her arms and bandaged up and stuff like that.  I like that.  Yeah, that's hot.  Well, she's got the psycho eyes on the front page of the post today, Lindsay Lohan.  Yeah, Lindsay is on the fast track.  You know, Paris Hilton, a lot of people think she's a dummy, but the woman is brilliant. 
[00:56:00]  She knows how to get attention.  Yes.  For doing what?  We don't even know what she does.  All she does is get attention.  She doesn't sing.  She's great.  I challenge anyone to play Paris Hilton's song and not dance.  But that was some invention.  That was some producer making her sound great.  No, it was Paris.  Did she sound great?  She certainly did.  Well, they made her sound like a pop star, and it's a very poppy song.  Yeah.  Absolutely, but if you heard her just natural voice, it doesn't sound like that. 
[00:56:30]  No way.  We did on her sex tape.  What's that?  We did on her sex tape, heard her natural voice.  Well, it was muffled.  You're a little too close to the microphone.  Anyway, the bimbo.  You're popping your peas.  The bimbo summit, they're partying all over Hollywood, and the paparazzi can't get enough of this.  And Britney Spears is smiling.  She's happy because she's getting this great exposure.  But Ant and I and Jimmy were talking about what goes on before they hit the streets there. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, there's got to be the bimbo summit where they talk about what they're going to do.  It's got to be pre-planned where they all take off the panties so when they get out, you're going to get a good view.  My God, guys, what are we going to do to you?  Let's go for the no-panty paparazzi shots.  Let's go for the oopsie.  We'll go for the oopsie here on the bimbo summit. 
[00:57:30]  I am declaring this oopsie day.  Oopsie day is tomorrow.  I want everybody involved.  I attended the bimbo summit yesterday.  The bimbo summit.  The bimbo summit.  Oh, just terrific.  Walk in.  The whole summit room just smells like trout.  For some reason, maybe they're hungry.  Having sushi.  Having sushi.  By the way, you're about to hear a typical guy. 
[00:58:00]  We're all like this, by the way.  Kenny in Queens, go ahead.  What's up, brother?  Hey.  Hi.  You guys, I know that everything is funny.  There's plenty of things to look at with these pictures, but you guys see the inset on  the page 39.  Page 39 in the post?  Yeah.  All right.  Wade, let me get my workbook out.  Sorry, out of towners.  All right.  Yes.  New York Post, page 39.  Look at that picture.  Huh?  Look at that hammer toe.  Is that thing not disgusting?  Oh, God.  If she put that, it looks like a thumb. 
[00:58:30]  Wait, who?  The small picture of Brittany getting out.  The hammer toe.  It's like.  Oh, my God.  It's her right foot and her big toe goes way to the left.  Oh, my God.  And way past all the other toes.  Well, the right foot goes, I mean, it goes way to the right.  Yes.  Yeah.  And you see how the big toe, the third toe is bigger than the second toe?  Dude, the big toe is twice as big as it should be.  It looks like it belongs to an African animal. 
[00:59:00]  She really should.  She has feet like a sleet stack.  It lands a lost.  Listen, I got a baby.  I don't like to touch the feet, but I like pretty feet.  But look, this girl's feet.  She would.  Oh, my God.  Do you understand what?  Hammer toe.  You understand what Kenny's doing here?  We all do it.  We're looking at Britney Spears.  She's a piece of ass.  She's showing us way more than we've ever seen before.  But we'll always find something wrong with the hot shit.  Well, that foot is just bizarre.  This girl's got right here. 
[00:59:30]  I would never show those toes in public.  She should not be allowed anywhere near open-toed shoes.  Dude, she's doing pretty good.  If you have to go all the way down to her big toe to find something wrong with her, though.  It wouldn't bother me if the end of her feet had prostate cancer hanging off of her.  I don't care.  Listen, I'm telling you right now.  This foot has to go.  She's got all that money.  She's got to get one extended and the other one straightened out and cut down on something.  No, right on, Kenny.  This thing is ridiculous.  It looks like an orangutan foot.  That really is an awful foot. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And Paris has awful feet, too.  That's one of the worst feet I've ever seen.  All right, Kenny.  We got it.  Could be worse than Paris's.  Paris has some nasty ligament.  You can see all the ligaments that connect on the top of the foot.  She's got a big, long foot.  It's like a foot-long foot.  And then it's got, like, connecting rods that run along the top just under the skin.  Bony.  Yuck.  I don't mind that.  Oh, my God. 
[01:00:30]  That thing is...  Oh, he just doesn't like that foot.  You know, I got to admit it, though.  Our own stalker, Patty, has a better big toe than Britney Spears.  Britney should be running a bed and breakfast with that awful foot.  Awful toe.  All right, Kenny.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  Let's say hi to Rowdy in Illinois.  Rowdy.  Yeah, morning, boys.  Good morning.  I would love to hear Uncle Paul comment on a Dakota Fanning oopsie shot.  Jeez, dude.  I don't think she was part of the bimbo summit. 
[01:01:00]  People already loving Uncle Paul.  No, it's funny you say that about Dakota Fanning.  I think she's a little bit past the prime.  Terrible.  Yeah.  She's a cute kid.  You're talented.  Maybe you should stay away from children.  Hey, a little heads up to the guys in the office.  Good morning, America.  Most violent video games. 
[01:01:30]  The games parents should stay away from if they're buying a video game for their children.  All right.  I'm sure it's going to be like games that are 10 years old.  Well, the one that we're proudly represented in, Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, is the top of the list.  Hey, there they go.  They're showing a little GTA.  Yes, then.  And as they're showing this thing about all the harmful effects, they show an old woman get sniped in Grand Theft Auto on the television just to illustrate their point. 
[01:02:00]  A nice headshot.  Oh, yeah.  Head comes off.  The spurting blood.  Yeah, the spurting blood.  Love it.  Oh, God.  This argument again.  What are your kids playing?  Most violent video games.  It was some kind of cockamamie study that was just recently done by some cockamamie scientists that said that after kids play violent video games, there is some type of brain activity that is left over, this residual brain activity that is more prone to violent behavior. 
[01:02:30]  So, you know, these people that are trying to get these games banned have finally gotten their proof, you know, by some scientists that I'm sure are biased.  They've been trying to prove this crap for years.  Stop.  For years.  Was there violence before video games?  No.  Nope.  No.  None whatsoever.  No violence?  No.  I remember.  Matter of fact, a cop who shot 31 times his favorite video game?  Pac-Man.  Was it Pac-Man?  Yeah, not even Miss Pac-Man. 
[01:03:00]  Wouldn't that make you, like, just go around biting people, though?  Yeah.  Like that.  Like, I remember when Pong came out, I grabbed the flat surface and would just smack someone across the head and send them flying across and go, bloop, bloop, when they hit a wall.  Bloop, bloop.  I'd set it for squash or tennis or ping pong.  How about Donkey Kong?  Donkey Kong.  Donkey Kong.  Yeah.  I played that for about a week and I had to stop because I was throwing barrels down on people.  I was just rolling them down, various ramp things that I built. 
[01:03:30]  Actually, being the Italian, I was trying to get back up and kill Patrice at the top.  Well, of course.  It's in your blood.  Rolling barrels down on me.  It's in your blood.  We all know it.  Speaking of which, I was...  It's so handy, though, anytime I need a little cash, I just jump up and bang my head on a flat surface and coins fall down.  Mamma mia.  It is wonderful for me, being an Italian, but I have to wear a goofy, stereotypical Italian, just off the boat little suit. 
[01:04:00]  I got to tell you, we've talked about this over the years.  I'm playing Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories for the PSP.  Loving it, right?  Yeah.  We pull up to work today and there's a cab right out front.  All of a sudden, my brain, because I'm not fully awake, I'm like, man, I could steal that cab and make some money right now.  Oh.  See, you do think about it, but you don't do it.  Dude, but it gets in your head.  Yeah.  Like, Kenny is driving me to work today. 
[01:04:30]  I'm like, why are you stopping at red lights?  Because, obviously, I played the game right up until bedtime.  No.  So, I'm sitting there like, wow, this is kind of weird to actually stop at red lights.  Why would you do that?  I'm getting chastised.  I know Ted Williams didn't play for the Yankees.  Yeah.  I said, two Yankees.  I was confused.  It was fine, but he knew what you meant.  We were just having fun.  No, he's a, yeah.  Nicky, Ned Nicky.  All right, we'll talk about that.  His head will always be a Red Sox to me.  So, the Ted Williams stunk anyway.  Not a good head. 
[01:05:00]  That frozen head just sitting there somewhere.  Do we have our Ted Williams clip?  I don't know.  I love that clip.  Ted.  Yeah, we'll play it after the break then.  We'll find it.  Penny party!  Ah.  We got the audio.  Maybe we should do that today.  Not at the Bimbo Summit.  Hey, by the way, it's time for MacBook Karaoke.  Yes.  MacBook Karaoke.  Go to www.923freefm.com for all the details.  That's 923freefm.com for all the details. 
[01:05:30]  You can win the new MacBook, sleek and sexy, and has everything you need to explore all  your creative possibilities.  Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out.  But it's MacBook Karaoke.  If you go to 923freefm.com, you'll have all the details there, okay?  Can you dig that?  I'd do the chooker.  Shut up.  Ugh.  I put myself through that torture.  Comic Relief has been on.  HBO has been replaying it on their various HBO channels, and I had to sit through the 
[01:06:00]  whole thing just to wait for Billy Crystal to do his Black Gentleman impression from...  The Comic Relief.  Yeah.  New Orleans.  The old jazz musician.  Yeah, the old jazz musician character he does.  The only time it's called moving.  Moving.  It almost moved me to throw something through my television.  I swear to you, it was the dumbest, most pompous...  The guy actually thought he was being poignant.  And when he said, can you dig it?  And no one was digging anything. 
[01:06:30]  No one was digging anything.  Ah, the LA Times dug it.  They dug it.  And I knew that she could.  How did you know?  Because no one gave you a response.  And like Dan said, shuffling papers, you hear coughing through the whole thing.  No one cared about this, but I subjected myself to it.  I had to.  I sat through the whole thing wincing.  If you get a chance, check it out.  It's awful.  Did you see Louis C.K. set on the Comic Relief?  I heard it was very good. 
[01:07:00]  I didn't see it.  No.  Okay.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons.  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing  down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my n****s are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:07:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Can I ask you something?  I did.  Where's the TP?  You don't want to know.  Where is it?  I sacrificed for my art.  Wait, where is it?  You ate it.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[01:08:00]  I wiped!  I don't have to explain everything.  Oh, that is disgusting.  Let's just put it this way.  For the pal talkers, we have bathroom cam today.  Yeah.  Jimmy started in, and now I accept the challenge.  Give me the heebie-jeebies.  See, but they expect it from Jimmy and I.  We're hoping that Anthony will share eventually.  No, I won't be sharing that.  No?  That is a private part of me that I will not be sharing. 
[01:08:30]  Nothing better than when you walk out, and you know your friend's going to walk into the bathroom and just see a lovely gift.  Well, Jimmy, of course we use our breaks here to visit the men's room, which is right here off the studio.  And when all three of us have to use it, even though the breaks might seem long to people,  it takes a while, you know.  So I was vying for position.  I knew Jimmy was in there.  I wanted to get in before Opie did because I don't want to stand there in any kind of a stench. 
[01:09:00]  So I rushed in there and walked up to the bowl, and Jimmy had not flushed.  And, yeah, something was staring back at me.  I looked right at it, right into the face of doom.  Nothing blocking the view?  You see how I positioned everything?  No, it was just, it was, yeah. 
[01:09:30]  You posed it like a serial killer.  I did.  John Douglas was looking at it, evaluating my personality.  He thinks I felt guilty.  Actually, no, he knew I didn't feel guilty.  I didn't cover it.  I profiled you from that, from what I saw.  He didn't love this one.  He's white, in his 30s.  That's true.  And George's Mexican.  Well, horrible. 
[01:10:00]  Because I was in such a rush, I ran right in and stared right down into it.  You, full throttle, right?  You, I've never seen a door fly open faster and a man run in and then back out of the room.  It was so hard.  And then you're asking me to get rid of it.  I'm like, what are you, high?  Why would I do that?  Why would I get rid of it?  You're not going to knock down your own sandcastle.  Of course you do.  And then after you, I went in there and gave a little treat.  Committed a homicide.  That was the worst.  Looked like what they pulled out of George Harrison's head. 
[01:10:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Penny Porter!  Oh, Tyra!  Want to do some Tyra?  Who doesn't?  We've covered the morbid news.  Why don't we have some fun now?  The self-centered, beautiful woman.  Yeah, for the new listeners, we can't get enough of Tyra.  She stinks.  Her TV show stinks.  But we discovered something as we watch this show every day.  She's a piece of ass?  She's a piece of ass.  We all know that. 
[01:11:00]  But she's just obsessed with herself.  With herself.  She turns everything around to make it about her.  No matter what the show's about, it could be something lighthearted.  It's got to be about Tyra.  It's got to be, if it's something tragic that someone went through, Tyra will tell you how  much more tragic her life was.  Right.  Even though, you know, it could be somebody that was born without a jaw.  Right.  And they're on the show and she'll talk about how she once chipped a tooth.  Or, yeah, she'll start crying saying how when she was a little girl, her jaw was a little 
[01:11:30]  big.  Mine was a little big, so I could understand how you felt.  I don't, I'm a jaw, you dummy.  Look at me.  You're beautiful.  I'm a monster.  But she's a monster.  I'm a monster.  But she's amazing because then she gets the person without the jaw to comfort her.  Yeah.  But you don't understand how hard it was for me because I was trying to be a model and  they said my jaw was too, oh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, you can cry 
[01:12:00]  on my shoulder.  There's no way to hold the saliva in.  He's drooling.  It's all about her.  Yeah, yeah.  This person comes on her show thinking she, you know.  Yeah, he's going to be the sympathetic character.  Right.  And he's like, why am I coddling a supermodel when I don't have a jaw?  Jesus.  I thought it was going to be about me today.  It was going to be about me.  I thought the audience was going to give me some ahs and ooh, and then I was going to  get like a surgery.  I was going to get a free trip and a performance from some boy band. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  A performance from a boy band.  Oh wait, that's Maury's trick.  And at the end, they were going to talk about how they were going to take a cadaver's jaw  and sew it on my face.  Stupid Maury makes everything better by having a performance from a boy band.  A third rate boy band.  It's not even like the boy bands that are popular.  Right.  Like we heard, you know, even though you were born without ears or eyelids and you're horrifying  to look at.  Right.  We have, who's your favorite band? 
[01:13:00]  42 Latitude.  We have 42 Latitude here today.  Who?  Who are these guys?  You're at home like, what?  Why?  You can't even get like, you know, I don't know, Backstreet Boys or.  Yeah.  Who do you, who even knows?  Whatever.  Yeah.  He never gets anybody.  Some poor pejoria kid has to watch Danny and the Juniors because they can't book a popular  band.  I don't understand who these people are.  Who are they, Maury?  Shut up.  Sit there and look pathetic.  In your years, they were popular four million years ago. 
[01:13:30]  It's supposed to be all okay after you see this performance.  They are all, all of them.  All these talk show hosts about them, but Tyra is the queen of it.  Is the greatest.  So she decides to have a panty party.  Panty party.  And, uh, and the audience, uh, has to take off their clothes and, and they have to feel  just as comfortable as, as Tyra would in her underpants.  I guess that's how they set it up.  It's being comfortable with yourself and, and you come into Tyra's show, you get caught 
[01:14:00]  up in the moment and you're like, yeah, my body.  I'm a mother of three, but, uh, you know, the neighbors say I still look good.  So, uh, you know, I'm, I could do this.  Yeah.  I'm going to take my clothes off and sit here in my bra and panties on the Tyra show with  the rest of the audience.  Right.  And there's a bunch of, you know, housewives sitting there.  Some of them, you know, probably looking all right.  Yeah.  You got a few lookers, a few lookers, a few milfs, as they call them. 
[01:14:30]  But for the most part, the audience is a mess.  And, and then they see Tyra and her, in her little tiny little underpants and, and, and  bras.  And now they're trying to pull up their underpants and cover up their, their C-section scars.  Right.  When they're feeling good about themselves, Tyra's got to come out.  Here I am.  And she's in her Victoria's secret, beautiful bra and matching panties and everything.  She even had, she had a stylist, uh, you know, make sure she had the perfect underpants  and bra.  Yeah.  Like, like, uh, make, and she had makeup done all over her body. 
[01:15:00]  So the makeup people worked on her.  And, and the, these mothers and housewives are now sitting there kind of, maybe their  arms are closing in a little more.  They're crossing their arms and leaning over in their chair a little further than they would.  Oh, Jesus.  The mom's wearing a pair of panties.  It looks like the towel that hangs on the ends of Quincy's table.  Sam, I got brain matter all over the floor.  Oh, wow.  Jimmy.  Hey, I love the Quincy.  That's amazing.  That's an amazing impression.  Jack Klugman sitting right next to me. 
[01:15:30]  But we just find it hilarious because it just gives her an excuse to look hot as, hot as  crap in front of everybody with her perfect body.  She could walk out in her panties and bra and people would go, wow, there is an attractive  woman.  Yeah.  But it has to be made more about her.  Yeah.  She's got to look like she does now compared to the audience.  Right.  So now she looks even better than she would have if she just trotted out like that.  See, the bit would be for Tyra to be, you know, in her underwear in front of other supermodels. 
[01:16:00]  Right.  But then Tyra would be like, oh, man.  I don't know.  I don't know.  They're a little younger than me.  They're younger.  So how do I look even better?  Well, I'll invite housewives from all over America to strip down with me.  Fanny party!  All right.  So maybe she should be around anorexic women.  And then whenever Tyra walks in, they all yell, fat pig alert, fat pig alert.  Fanny.  The best part of our Tyra clips is the commentary on the labeling. 
[01:16:30]  Tyra reminds her audience she used to model underwear, then shows how good her underwear  makes her feel by showing the audience.  Oh, great.  Any comments, Sam?  That's about it?  Yeah.  On that one?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's play the clip.  All right, everybody.  So I think a lot of you know that I have modeled a lot of lingerie over the years.  And I remember that I would have to cut a slit in the back of the panties when I was modeling  because I was always giving these sizes that were too small. 
[01:17:00]  See?  Right off the bat, see?  See?  Right off the bat.  Trying to make herself like one of them.  Yeah.  She's in turmoil because she had to cut the...  Maybe she had to cut the back out to get the job.  Well, she realized they hand her gay male model underwear.  And they do that just because it's more convenient.  You guys, I have this perfect bubble button.  Yeah.  What I had to do to fit into the tiny underpants was cut a slit. 
[01:17:30]  Cut the back of the panties.  So it would show off my perfect bubble button.  I'm short.  You see her ass?  Stop it.  But she always has to make it like, look, I'm just like you.  I have problems.  I got problems, too.  Just like you ladies out there.  Or maybe it's just that she's like a horse and she likes to shit and walk at the same time.  Panty party!  Yeah, there's a big panty party going on, Tyra. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  In the back of the panties when I was modeling, because I was always giving these sizes that were too small.  So I would cut them so that I wouldn't get that bloop, bloop thing on the sides.  You know when your panties are too tight?  You know?  And it does that little bloop, bloop thing.  Yeah, I hated that.  So I'd always cut them.  But the fact is that the kind of panties you wear can make a really big difference in the way that you look and the way that you feel.  And we know that they can make a difference in the way that a man feels about you, too.  Right? 
[01:18:30]  So today, we're going to show you how to find the right kind of underwear for your body.  And if we're going to be talking about underwear today, I think we've got to see what we're working with.  For example, I've gone on some underwear today, and I think they make me feel pretty fantastic.  What happened to this chick and little girl?  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  She's just a self-centered pain model.  She just needs the attention and the approval.  It's what she's gotten her whole life. 
[01:19:00]  She's one of these girls and then women who have never been told anything negative.  It's always been, oh, my God, you're beautiful here.  Let me shower you with this and that and jewels, and you'll get an easy job.  You're a model.  You'll be gawked at.  Even with all that, something is still missing in her brain is what I'm saying.  Yeah, well.  Because she's still looking for that attention.  The whole brain.  There she goes.  In fact, I'm going to show you how fantastic my underwear make me feel. 
[01:19:30]  By taking off her little robe and showing these wonderful Victoria's Secret panties and bra.  You know, it's rare I actually root for a suicide bomber.  I cannot think of a better place than that audience full of hens for someone to just yell a lock bar and just kill themselves.  Hens. 
[01:20:00]  Here's the best clip.  Tyra feels a little crazy, so she has the audience join her panty party, and I'm sure they look just as hot as her.  They're not even allowed to stand up, Ted.  No.  So gravity helps a little bit.  Instead, they're in these cold seats where their asses go, and their asses are like.  Yeah, they get the secretary spread, and then their belly hangs over the front of their panties because they're sitting.  Come on.  She's standing arched back.  She's gone to school.  You know, she's taking model training. 
[01:20:30]  She knows exactly how to stand to make her body look perfect.  And meanwhile, there's a housewife sitting there, frumped over with, like, that cleavage that's 18 inches apart.  You can see right down their bellies.  With their freckly boobs.  Yeah.  Their freckly cleavage.  Yeah, just hunched over.  She's nursed three kids.  Just devastated her.  Part of their ass is just cascading over the chair.  Yeah, she's rubbing thighs with the woman next to her. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, Jesus.  This has to be torture for these people.  She is just too much.  Wait, guys, I have an idea.  Panty party?  Panty party?  Studio.  Yeah?  Panty party!  Why don't we have an underpants party?  Yeah?  We'll just all take our clothes off right now?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you have fun with that.  For the listeners.  For the listeners.  Well, it isn't for me.  They're demanding it.  What about Uncle Paul? 
[01:21:30]  I wouldn't mind seeing Sam in his underpants.  Hey, could you just lisp for me?  Could you call me mister?  Kid's got a hell of a body on him.  Is he black or white?  I'll tell you.  Oh.  Ghoul.  The ghoul.  It's ghoulish.  All right, Tyra feels a little crazy, so she has the audience join her panty party.  I really feel crazy standing up here in my underwear.  I'm used to doing this on a, you know, a Victoria's Secret runway or in a catalog, but not on the Tyra show. 
[01:22:00]  So, I need a little help, everybody, on the count of one, two, three, I want you to lose those under the canopy robes right now.  Free that underwear, everybody.  There they are.  She's got to yell.  Because today, today is a panty party. 
[01:22:30]  Yes, it is.  Oh, my God.  We're a girl, guys like Charles Whitman.  Yeah.  Nice Teflon-coated bullet to that face.  I wish she was not on a Victoria's Secret runway.  I wish she was on runway five niner.  This next track, Tyra, talks about how much her bra size changes.  Listen to her interrupt her guest and brush her guest off when she tries to contribute again. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah?  All right.  Thanks, Sam.  Thanks for that contribution.  Good boy.  Finding underwear that fits and flatters is not easy, but it can be done.  And here with the skinny on how the right kind of skivvies can flatter your figure is the co-founder of StyleBakery.com.  And our friend here at the Tyra Show, Alison DeYette.  But it's not about her.  Share with us what the number one issue is for women when it comes to finding undies and that whole thing.  Buying the wrong size.  Women think that they're the same size for years. 
[01:23:30]  But really, when it comes to underwear and bras, you have to get yourself size every single year.  Because gravity, pregnancy, weight fluctuation can change your whole body shape.  It's true with me because when I'm...  Of course it is.  It's true with me, me, me, me.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Me, me, me.  Holy crap.  You shut up.  It's not always about you.  She's talking, and this woman is talking about fat housewives, women who have had children. 
[01:24:00]  She's talking about gravity, things that make women.  Where a woman that is wearing panties that she wore in her 20s, maybe now in her 30s or 40s, she needs bigger panties.  Not talking about Tyra.  Because she's raising three kids, working two jobs, just trying to keep it all together.  Tyra has a personal trainer, a dietician on call.  Guaranteed.  A stylist.  Her panty size has not changed since she was 16.  It probably changed a centimeter in the last 10 years. 
[01:24:30]  Nothing.  And changed her whole body shape.  It's true with me because when I was a C, I was wearing a B.  And then when I was a D...  Oh, and she was a...  You're still a C.  Not to mention an N.  Oh, God.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  Change her whole body shape.  It's true with me because when I was a C, I was wearing a B.  And then when I was a D, I was wearing a C.  And then over the holidays, I turned into a double D and I was wearing a D. 
[01:25:00]  I'm back to a D now.  But you're right.  You have to keep on from a B to an A.  Yeah.  Oh, we wanted to help real women who wrote it with common body issues.  Oh, God.  It was like a musical note.  Oh, it was a C.  Now it's an A minus.  A minor.  I know.  Of course you do. 
[01:25:30]  I just wanted to head them off at the pass.  She's got real problems in life.  She went from a D to a double D.  Aw.  The women in the audience went from like a D to an extra long.  Yeah.  Right, you know.  38 long.  They went from an A to a...  Yikes.  Tyra brushes off a woman's complaint of small breasts as a preference, not a problem.  Everyone in my family was blessed with big boobs. 
[01:26:00]  I was robbed.  Please, Tyra, help me at least look bigger.  All right.  Well, I don't think that's necessarily a problem.  That's more of a preference.  All right.  Because if you had all this, girl, you'd be like not being able to wear tank tops with  no bras.  It's a whole issue.  It's a whole issue.  That was in the middle of a segment that was completely around other people's problems.  So this girl comes up with her problem.  Which is...  Her problem is she's got small boobs and all her sisters, I guess, have big ones.  Right.  And Tyra's like, ah, you don't want...  Yeah, I don't want it.  You don't want the luscious ones I have. 
[01:26:30]  I can't wear tank tops.  The guy's looking at me all the time.  You don't want these lovelies strapped in here.  Let me tell you the problems I have.  Just take your boyish body and be happy.  Yeah.  Go Peter Pan.  The last clip here.  Tyra learns you have to wash and dry panties.  What's this about?  Oh, it's a person who's on there telling her how to take care of panties.  And I guess she seems amazed when she finds out that she has to put them in the dryer. 
[01:27:00]  What would she normally do?  Just wear them for two weeks?  Let the German Shepherd eat them off?  Okay, um...  Is it safe to, when you wash your underwear, I hear you're supposed to wash it, and since  you don't want to ruin it, you wash it and then hang dry it?  The whole...  You know what this is about, by the way?  What?  She doesn't wash and dry panties.  No, you heard her say, I hear you're supposed to wash them.  You know what?  She is so bloody rich, and I have sponsorships with Victoria's Secret, she probably has just 
[01:27:30]  crates and crates of her size.  She wears...  Never wears the same pair twice.  She's one and done.  Never wear the same pair twice.  And since you don't want to ruin it, you wash it and then hang dry it.  Is that the right way to do it?  No.  You've got to get heat on those bacteria, on those bugs.  You've got to heat it, heat it, heat it.  Bugs!  Either you want to wash it in hot water, but if you want your delicates not to fade, you  do cold water and heat.  You put it in the dryer.  So put your panties in the dryer.  Put your panties in the dryer.  Then hang them upside down and put a fork in them. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  You still have to, you know, don't put them on when they're wet, because that can cause  yeast infections.  All right.  This is really...  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  She really gets to the bottom of the issue, though.  You have to wash and dry your underpants.  Yeah.  She's really hard-hitting.  Yeah.  She's just like Oprah.  Well, Oprah's not doing a panty party, though.  No.  Not at all.  Oh, boy.  Thank God.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  So you got to wash them with some heat, some hot water, to get rid of the bugs.  There's bugs crawling around there, huh? 
[01:28:30]  That can cause yeast infections.  All right.  This is really good to know, because as you guys know, I've modeled lingerie a long time.  We know.  We know.  You have to say it again.  You told us.  I've modeled lingerie for a long time.  Long time.  All right.  This is really good to know, because as you guys know, I've modeled lingerie a long time.  And I know about putting the panties in the dryer.  So thank you so much, doctor.  Thank you so much.  He knows about putting panties in a dryer.  That's great, Tyra.  Oh, is this woman just an ass? 
[01:29:00]  Wow.  Is she a self-obsessed little brat?  We can't get enough of her, though.  We love the Tyra clips.  Keep them coming, boys.  Keep them coming.  I can't wait until Kenny has a story about her to read.  Well, you know, the panties, you put them on wet, you're going to get the yeast.  I tell these women, they don't listen.  Now, I want that story to end.  I wanted to start off with, sadly, Tyra Banks.  I want it to end with, a la Jane Mansfield.

[01:31:00]  Opie and Anthony!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:31:30]  We got to go right to the phone and say hi to Joe Namath.  Joe!  Hey, fellas.  How are you, sir?  Yes, Joe Namath.  I'm doing well.  It's good to hear you guys.  Very good.  Good to hear you, Joe.  Wow, look at that voice.  You got that voice, Joe.  He's got that voice.  You know it's Joe Namath.  Yep.  Oh, me.  Yeah.  You got a book out?  I do.  I do.  I did a book with a Rugged Land publisher called Namath, and I was influenced, certainly, by the couple of books that they had already done with Brett Favre and Walter Payton. 
[01:32:00]  I just liked the quality of the books, and then Rugged Land seemed like a good team to work with, and right now they are, and we're having a good run.  The book's finished, and we're very proud of it.  It kind of feels like a textbook feel to it.  It's all got pretty cool paper.  It's not like that dry, awful paper.  I like the feel of a lot of photos.  Yes, yes.  And by, you know, Harry Benson and Neil Leifer and Bart Silverman are some top-notch photographers, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Now, how about the girls?  Are there any talk about the girls in here?  Because that's, you know, the legendary Joe Namath.  We would love to know about the girls.  Well, I've talked about most things that were pertinent that I could share with the reader.  This is basically a book to be shared with the family, and the DVD that's added to it by NFL Films is a very fine DVD.  I've never, you know, I've worked on four books now. 
[01:33:00]  I had help with Dick Schaap and Bob Oates Jr. on three of them.  This one was different, certainly, and it was more difficult and took longer to get done.  But I enjoyed the process.  Now, Joe, I've got to ask you, in this book, does it include probably the pinnacle of your career,  playing catch with young Bobby Brady on the Brady Bunch?  Yeah, old Bobby tried to fool me that time. 
[01:33:30]  I remember that.  You know, you didn't have to be such a nice guy and go over their house.  For God's sake, the guy's lying that he knows you.  Yeah, we caught him, though, see?  We taught him a lesson.  Yeah, said he was sick.  And then Joe, being nice, goes over and sees this sick boy.  Yeah.  And it turns out that his father was sick.  Yeah.  You didn't walk into your trailer and have to throw Mr. Brady out, did you?  Yeah.  I'm sure Mr. Brady really took a liking to you.  That's pretty amazing.  The Brady Bunch had such a following to this day. 
[01:34:00]  Of course.  People would say, hey, I remember the Brady Bunch you did.  Isn't that?  Yeah.  It's a kick.  Go out for a pet.  You should have drilled one right into his head.  Hey, you know, they put him in a harness and raised him about 30 feet over the stage  and then crossed the stage with him up there 30 feet.  He crossed.  I wouldn't have gotten up there.  No.  He went above and beyond the call of duty, I thought.  Very memorable episode.  You're right up there with Davey Jones.  Are you disgusted at all with a lot of the players today? 
[01:34:30]  Maybe it's just perception.  The media coverage is different.  Are they really as arrogant and awful as they seem?  They seem a little bit different back 30 years ago.  Well, it certainly was different.  But, guys, things have been changing for a good while now.  We're not seeing anything new that hasn't existed since the 80s.  You know, the NFL has done a pretty good job in policing the players' behavior out there  and trying to keep it focused on the game.  But you have show business more in the game today than ever before. 
[01:35:00]  I personally don't like that they're policing all that.  I love all the showboating.  It makes it so exciting, all the crap they're doing in the end zone and stuff.  Right.  But some of it is certainly out of place, any kind of taunting deals and premeditated stuff.  You know, we are a team out on the field.  But when the individual stuff starts taking center stage, I know it's good for home entertainment.  But for teamwork and the rest of the group, they don't really care for that. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, but they take care of their own.  I mean, if you're showboating too much, you're going to pay down the road.  Of course.  Of course.  But this has been going on.  I remember when Billy White Shoes Johnson started doing the dancing, man.  And that was all right.  There were a lot of guys, you know, doing some things in nice ways.  But then it got ugly.  It got mean.  It kind of got, you know, out of line.  And then it's really reach.  Guys start reaching.  You know, whenever they're planning and plotting what they're going to do for a game rather than play, you know they're not quite focused. 
[01:36:00]  You know, when you're doing a five-step dance routine in the end zone, it really is kind of uncomfortable to watch.  Or pull out a cell phone, you know.  Oh, didn't he?  He grabbed a cell phone behind them.  Yeah.  That really is pompous.  Yeah.  Bring props.  Joe, I got a memory of you.  I used to be a caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club.  And I was maybe 14 or 15 at the time.  And you came to play a round of golf.  This goes back a few years.  And you were out there.  And every single female member followed you around that day. 
[01:36:30]  You didn't even know they were following you around because they were hiding in the bushes and behind trees and stuff.  Joe was hiding in the bushes later that evening.  But it was unbelievable how many women were following you around just as you played one round of golf at the Huntington Crescent Club back in the day.  Why didn't you tell me?  I was just a nobody.  It was Broadway Joe, man.  You were quite the showman back then, you know. 
[01:37:00]  But when you mention caddy, you bring back some memories, too, because I did that for about six years and loved it.  Yeah, it was probably my favorite job.  Yeah, that was good.  I have one complaint, though.  You could have picked any broad on the sideline and you went after Susie there.  The famous clip.  I mean, she's not a looker, Joe.  I've got to be the one to tell you.  You could have any broad in America and you picked her.  I'm sure she's a fine lady and she does a good job on the sidelines.  But, I mean, come on, Joe.  You let us down. 
[01:37:30]  Well, I have apologized, but not because of what you say about her.  Beauty's in the eye of the behold.  There you go.  Each his own.  Hey, did you wake up the next morning and just go, thank God it wasn't Pam Oliver?  No, but what I did the next morning, I felt like a real dog, you know, whenever I figured  out what had Trance.  Oh, no one saw it, Joe.  It wasn't bad, dude.  Don't worry about it.  It was harmless.  No, it made for me.  Barely anyone saw it.  It was done, you know.  It was done.  And then it was time to change your pace, man.  It happened. 
[01:38:00]  I'm sure the joking continues to this day among your circle friends, though.  You guys are bad.  You know something, Joe?  I have to confront you on this.  You made a year of my life miserable when I was in elementary school because of that goddamn  fur coat.  My mother, who, of course, was in love with Joe Namath, saw you in the fur coat.  Now, when you're Broadway Joe Namath and you're, you know, winning Super Bowls and you're 
[01:38:30]  out there in the fur coat, it's cool.  Going to Hollywood premiere.  Yeah, you're going to parties.  You got the hot blood on your arm.  You can wear the fur coat.  You're making CeCe and Company.  Yeah.  You're making movies.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, you're a CeCe writer.  You're wearing the fur coat.  It's cool.  My mother went and got a fur coat for me.  I don't even know.  I think I was in, like, the third or fourth grade.  I got my ass kicked because I was wearing a fur coat like a girl. 
[01:39:00]  Well, it might have been that ribbon in your hair, too.  You know?  Actually, she was such a Joe Namath fan, she sent me in stockings also.  Hey, did you, honestly, did you wear Brute?  Of course I did.  I did that even in college.  That's why it was so much fun to go to work with them initially.  Yeah.  The folks that were owners of Fabergé were just a terrific group, so I had fun, yeah.  Muhammad Ali wore Brute, too, you know, and so did. 
[01:39:30]  It was something we enjoyed doing, and it was a great company to work with.  No high karate back then?  No, no, no.  Hey, Joe, you bring up Muhammad Ali.  Were you ever starstruck?  Because, I mean, everyone.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Who were you starstruck by?  Bob Hope, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra.  Matt Peck.  Yeah, yeah.  All the biggies.  They turned out being guys, you know, that I had admired their work over the years.  But, yeah, for the most part, they were those kind of guys. 
[01:40:00]  And, you know, when you meet some folks that have accomplished some things, whether it's political or in the arts, it's always fun.  I was starstruck, man.  I never met Roberto Clemente, but I was starstruck with him since I was a little kid, you know.  I was a big baseball fan and all.  Oh, that's right.  You're from the Pittsburgh area?  Yes, yes, just outside of Pittsburgh.  But I'll never forget when I first met Gregory Peck, you know, he had that really deep voice. 
[01:40:30]  And they introduced me to him.  I said, how do you do, Mr. Peck?  And he says, just call me Greg, Joe.  I said, yes, sir, Mr. Peck.  Yeah, exactly.  I couldn't get myself to call him Greg.  Hey, was there anybody in the NFL that you were scared of?  I mean, look, you got hit a lot.  Was there anybody that you just wanted nothing to do with hitting you?  Yeah, a whole bunch of them, man.  You know, they were sick, a lot of those guys.  What was tough is like before a game, you know, you're standing beside him for the introductions.  And I'll never forget one time standing beside his defensive end. 
[01:41:00]  He was sweating.  His eyes were red.  He was about six foot eight.  And I just said to myself, what am I doing here?  Really?  I mean, yeah, there was some folks out there.  And there are today.  You know, that's their job, man.  They've got a lot of enthusiasm.  And it's to knock other people down, you know.  You know, it was fun to watch, though, back then, where the quarterback would scramble and run with the ball like that instead of just sliding down or heading for the sideline or something like that. 
[01:41:30]  I mean, obviously, it took its toll on your body.  Well, even today, you know, what the NFL has done, and it's not just for quarterbacks.  They've altered the rules to prevent some injuries, hopefully so, to the head and to the knees and all, and rules that have helped the offensive linemen, defensive players, help prevent some injuries.  The quarterback's a bit of a stretch.  I've seen some of the calls recently.  And, you know, if you're a defensive player, you can't believe that you get a penalty for that. 
[01:42:00]  But if they didn't enforce those penalties, then the teams would lose their best players.  The fans wouldn't get the quality of the game.  You know, you get two or three quarterbacks knocked out, though.  Man, it's a hard position, and you're just going to have the quality of the game go downhill.  So I think it also helps maintain a good play.  Hey, Joe, who's the best quarterback in the league right now?  Well, you know, I'd have to go with Tom Brady for past performances if we had to go in the one game right now. 
[01:42:30]  I'd take Tom Brady, certainly.  But in my opinion, I've not seen anyone like Peyton Manning.  He's one of a kind.  He really is amazing.  How about the most overrated player?  I think there's an overrated player in the game.  P.L.I. Manning.  I don't know about overrated players, but I also look at some young players.  And what I've been impressed with at this point is the quarterback of Tennessee.  There was a lot of questions about Evans.  And the more I watch him, the more I'm saying, yeah, they're right about this guy.  They're right about this guy. 
[01:43:00]  We forget that the guy's just a rookie.  And he won't be running around downfield a whole lot either.  But Tennessee's coming on, and I'm very impressed with him as a young quarterback.  Right on.  And who wins the Super Bowl this year, Joe?  That's the old question that none of us ever know until we get there, it seems, because of Lady Luck.  Look what happened to McNabb the other day.  He gets knocked out, and the Eagles aren't going to measure up now.  No.  You know, they might have had a chance to make the playoffs, but they're not going to measure up now.  If Lady Luck were to pull the same cruel act on a few of the other players, not just quarterbacks, 
[01:43:30]  but if you lose a Manning, if you lose Brady, you know, look what Denver's doing.  I'm a little surprised.  Going to Cutler, you know, they're starting a rookie quarterback now, and they're still really in the hunt.  So that's going to be interesting.  Hey, in 99, you were right, 96 on the list of 100 greatest football players.  Who was ahead 95th?  I have no idea what you're talking about. 
[01:44:00]  They listed you.  Apparently, we have it in our bio here.  The Sporting News had a list of 100 greatest football players, and I was wondering who was right ahead of you,  because if it annoyed you or not.  I'll tell you, it's got to be a whole lot of them ahead of old Joe.  You guys got to remember something, man.  I knew that I wasn't up to speed when I was coming in.  And there have been guys that have played many years, like myself,  but have been able to perform more consistently over the years.  Yeah, you had personality, Joe. 
[01:44:30]  Anytime, when I hear what Paul Bear Bryant has to say, or Vince Lombardi, or Weeb Eubank,  when those pro coaches and your peers have some things to say about you, that's what I listen to.  So I'm just glad that things worked out and we won the championship.  Well, the book is called Namath.  It really looks good, man.  A lot of great photos, a whole history of your career.  And is it on sale now?  Yes.  Yeah.  Less reading, more photos.  Always good. 
[01:45:00]  Yes.  Joe knows that.  Lots and lots of photos.  Very cool talking to you, Joe.  Hey, thank you, Opie Anthony.  You guys take care of yourselves.  And little Jimmy Norton, too.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy.  Speak up.  No, I've been talking, but we're all just three chiming in.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Take care, Joe.  Thank you for having me on.  All right.  It's Joe Namath, everyone.  That is very cool.  Joe Willie Namath.  Yep.  You guys are bad.  Bad.  Someone's saying he sounded like the Greaseman.  Water doodle there. 
[01:45:30]  He had that same delivery.  Yeah.  Oh, wasn't he in Playgirl, too?  What spread did he do?  Did he do a spread for a magazine like that?  I was going to ask you about it.  I wasn't like a queer if I was.  Wow.  Yeah, you would have anyway.  Wrong, right?  I just thought you know that.  But he did.  Didn't he do a spread in one of them?  I don't know.  Sam?  You're not going to get an answer from any of us.  I don't know.  Why?  It's okay to know that.  No, it isn't.  Oh, was that Burt Reynolds?  Oh, Burt was in it, yeah.  All right.  I'm mixing up my tricky people.  You know that, Kenny?  Of course he knows it.  And you even know that. 
[01:46:00]  Stop.  What?  That Burt Reynolds was in Playgirl?  You know that.  I don't think Burt Reynolds was in Playgirl.  I think it was Cosmo.  Cosmo Kramer?  But you knew he did a nude spread.  He certainly wasn't in jet.  You knew he did a nude spread is what I'm saying, though.  Yeah.  Maybe it was Cosmo.  He looked like a bearskin rug.  With the leg propped up?  I don't know.  I don't remember the pose.  No, no.  It's Burt laying on his side. 
[01:46:30]  And he has a towel covering what a lot of us call best parts.  Ladies.  Hey, yesterday we started this bit.  I think we have time to do a few more.  Now with this whole Michael Richards Kramer thing.  What happened?  Well, the latest thing now is, you know, the black leaders, they want to ban the N-word  from entertainment.  Yeah, from everything.  Everything from movies to rap lyrics. 
[01:47:00]  Never to hear the word ever, ever, ever again.  Banish it.  They're just blah, blah, blah.  It's not going to happen.  Stop.  It's just not going to happen.  Not until behavior changes.  So, we're taking a look at some of the greatest scenes in movies and how they would be different  if the N-word was banned from these fine movies.  It takes some away.  Like, here's an example.  My orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved  core. 
[01:47:30]  There is no racial bigotry here.  Here we do not look down on African-Americans, Jewish people, Italian-Americans, or Mexican-Americans.  Here, you are all equally worthless.  Is that understood?  Yes, sir!  Listen to us.  We sound pathetic.  You really do.  There's R. Lee Ermey giving us the drill, and we're just, yeah, sir.  You're all about to invade and take over a bathhouse.  God, I'm glad I wasn't here for that.  embarrassing answers you gave that real man. 
[01:48:00]  I know.  Sir, yes, sir!  Hey, a great movie out there, True Romance.  Yes.  Ah!  Famous scene.  Yes, well...  Well, you could not possibly do it without the use of the N-word.  Well, you know, if the black leaders have it their way and we ban this word, that scene  would be drastically different.  It's absolutely amazing to me to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, that  that Sicilians still carry the African-American genes. 
[01:48:30]  Now, this...  No, I'm quoting history.  It's written.  It's a fact it's written.  I know this guy.  I know this guy.  I know this guy.  No.  It's a fact.  Yeah.  Your ancestors...  ...of African-American.  Uh-huh.  Hey.  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  And...  And your great, great, great, great grandmother.  ...an African-American.  Yeah.  And she had a half African-American kid.  Now, if that's a fact, tell me, am I lying?  Goddamn.  All that makes me want to do is see that movie again.  I know.  Yeah.  What a great scene.  Could be the best scene in a movie ever.  Because Dennis, just watching them act, because Hopper's doing this thing with his right hand where he's going, 
[01:49:30]  he has a bloody rag and he's just twisting it to and fro.  And Walken isn't playing it angry or tough.  He's laughing.  He's laughing, but he's fuming inside.  How great of a choice is that, just to smile and be happy?  It's menacing.  Yeah.  Oh, I love this guy.  He gives him a little tsk, tsk finger.  The tsk, tsk, you.  And then he puts a bullet in his head.  Hopper just knows he's dead at that point.  He knows he's dead.  Trying to get killed quick. 
[01:50:00]  Yep.  True romance.  One of the best scenes ever shot.  Yeah.  Going to watch it tonight now.  Absolutely have to now.  And finally, we got one more example.  If they ban the N-word from movies, this scene would be a lot different from Do the Right Thing.  Boy, do I have a great clip to bring in tomorrow.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, let's continue this for another day.  Mookie's f***ing talking on the phone.  People are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.  Mookie!  20 minutes. 
[01:50:30]  How come African-Americans are so stupid?  You see an African-American.  Kick his ass.  F*** you and stay off the phone.  Hey, Mookie, forget about it.  Can I talk to you for a second?  What?  Pino, who's your favorite basketball player?  Magic Johnson.  Who's your favorite movie star?  Eddie Murphy.  Who's your favorite rock star?  Prince.  You're a prince.  Boss, Bruce, Prince, Bruce, Pino. 
[01:51:00]  All you ever talk about is African-American this and African-American that.  And all your favorite people are so-called African-Americans.  It's different.  Magic Eddie Prince.  I'm not African-Americans.  I mean, they're not black.  I mean, let me explain myself.  They're not really black.  I mean, they're black or they're not really black.  They're more than black.  It's different.  It's different.  Yeah, to me, it's different.  And there you have it.  I love Spike Lee.  There you have it. 
[01:51:30]  Someone is asking if we did Blazing Saddles.  Yes, we did.  Yeah, we did Blazing Saddles.  We did that yesterday.  You've got to listen longer.  I think I know which one you're bringing.  No.  No, you're not?  What did you think?  I'll tell you.  Which one are you bringing, Jimmy?  They're whispering.  Brady?  Oh, my God.  I forgot that.  Come on.  That's a perfect one.  Which one?  That clip of Nick?  It's one of our favorite ones.  You'll know it as soon as you hear it.  Yeah.  All right.  I have one that no one in this room will know.  Oh.  All right.  Jimmy, we'll bring that in tomorrow.  In case you missed it.  Home videos?  Yes. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  Me and my dad talking and laughing, accusing my mom of being a something lover.  Ha!  Yeah, we did it yesterday.  But once again, here's the Blazing Saddles one.  Hold it.  The next man makes a move that the African-American gets it.  Hold it, man.  He's not bluffing.  Listen to him, man.  He's just crazy enough to do it.  Drop it.  I swear I'll blow this African-American's head all over this town.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  He's desperate.  Do what he's saying. 
[01:52:30]  Do what he's saying.  It kind of changes the movie.  A little bit.  It takes away the impact.  But, you know, hopefully, hopefully that'll go through.  Everyone will agree.  And that awful word will be removed from everybody's vocabulary, movies.  Let's all just calm down.  Re-edit movies that have the word in it.  Let's just calm down.  We can't start banning words.  Oh, I see a picture of Jimmy Norton and Spike Lee. 
[01:53:00]  I'm a Spike fan.  I like them.  I met him at the Jeter dinner.  You're a Spike lover?  I do love Spike.  Right.  I have for many years.  Hey, still lots of show to do.  We have another Maybe You Should Sit Down segment from Kenny.  Oh, wonderful.  Should we do it again?  Why not?  All right, we'll do another Maybe You Should Sit Down segment with Club Soda Kenny.  We had some of the biggest successes of our careers drilling things into the ground.  Why should we stop?  Well, when we get a new bit, we get very excited. 
[01:53:30]  And we push it hard in the beginning.  And then it'll just calm down and have a life of its own.  Also, violent video games.  That's always in the news.  They've got some crap to say about that today on TV.  And I don't know if we're going to get to it today, but Karen Meyer, one of our favorite  newswomen from Chicago.  Oh, what?  The deaf newswoman, Karen Meyer, does a report on blind artists.  Got to hear it.  Got to hear that?  That's top priority on my list.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:54:00]  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out with big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  Swinging tribute to unrestrained female enemies.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Saturday, December 2nd.  Dude, do you compost your own shit?  You rolling around with Steve C with some fucking rims on your Prius?  Yes.  It's the Laszlo Show.  So I have this theory that when you're jerking off, it's like a kaleidoscope in your mind. 
[01:54:30]  But doesn't a kaleidoscope, you mean like a, like a Viewmaster, all the, all the...  Yeah, maybe a Viewmaster kaleidoscope.  It's all the same.  Opie and Anthony present The Laszlo Show.  Saturday, December 2nd.  From 9 till midnight Eastern.  Welcome back.  The Opie and Anthony radio program is returning. 
[01:55:00]  It's Opie and Anthony with myself and Iraq and some other people.  I mean, it's not just us.  Wow.  It's good, right?  You do.  You do a great job of bringing the show back.  That was really good.  I feel like I bring it back with a lot of spunk, a lot of pizzazz.  It's smooth.  Yeah.  Seamless.  Yeah.  Seamless, even better.  Love it.  Hey, Joe Rogan's doing the show tomorrow and Friday.  We love Joe Rogan.  Yeah.  I'm going to knock Joe's teeth out.  You're going to knock his teeth out, huh?  Really.  Really. 
[01:55:30]  Good luck with that.  Joe's got hairy knuckles.  And Joe would slap you a face and knock you to the ground.  Joe's a man.  I haven't seen Rogan in a while.  He's a fear factor, dude.  He's a good boy.  And, of course, the ultimate fighting thing, too.  He does a great job of announcing those fights.  Yeah, he really does.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  He knows every move.  He knows all the positions and the guys.  That means he's going to be here for the eggnog drinking contest, which is Friday. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  Good.  God, I love the eggnog drinking contest.  This is the third time around.  Yeah.  Will Pat from Minnaki get his title back?  I hope so.  We'll see.  I'm rooting for him.  It's a double shot of eggnog every minute.  You puke, you're out until one man is standing.  Simple rules.  Puke, you're out.  Pat has the record at 71 double shots, I believe.  And other guys, you know, unless you have something to engage that with, you're not quite sure if that's a lot. 
[01:56:30]  It sounds like a lot.  But other guys have dropped out after 10, 11 double shots.  We've had guys here that are like, yeah, and they're all, you know, all pumped up, talking it up.  Yeah, I'm going to kick ass.  After 10 shots, they're like, and we ask people like, how are you doing?  Or, you know, I noticed that last shot took you a little longer.  And then they go, yeah, it's getting a little rough.  It's getting a little rough.  And then we know.  Just keep your eye on this guy.  Yeah.  And then before you know it. 
[01:57:00]  The sounds of eggnog pouring out of a man.  So freaking hard.  Yeah, and usually a lot of these guys are very big truck drivers.  They're like, oh, this is a breeze.  It's nothing.  And they all have a story.  Dude, one year I drank all the eggnog at the house.  It was like more than this.  I could do it.  I know.  So 15 shots in. 
[01:57:30]  Tell your friends, eggnog drinking contest Friday on the Opie and Anthony show.  And as a special feature, I will be doing a shot of eggnog.  Whoa.  Hey, hey.  It's kind of like a Tyra moment.  And from here.  Make it about you.  Actually, for you music fans, we got Jet coming in tomorrow to do a song or two.  Oh.  They're popular, right?  Are you going to be my girl?  Yeah.  I don't know that song.  Love Jet.  They got new stuff out right now.  Okay.  Karen Meyer reports on Blind Artist.  You want to go there, you said?  Love the Karen Meyer, the deaf reporter who just so happens coincidentally enough. 
[01:58:00]  I hear at the station she works at, all the reporters get together and draw stories out of hats because you don't want to give preference over one guy.  Their stories are good.  You know, as a reporter, you would want that.  And she just coincidentally enough always gets the handicapped stories.  You're kidding, right?  Of course I'm kidding.  She's being completely exploited by the television station because she is handicapped.  Hold on.  Could somebody smash my face?  I want to smack you. 
[01:58:30]  It's like, wow.  Just think of the odds that every time she'd get the handicapped story.  Oh, I should be shocked.  Could you picture her just going,  You never hear that.  It's just about her and the handicapped.  And the burn victims and the cripples.  You know, we get a lot of hate mail after we do this segment.  We do this from time to time.  People hate that the segment ends so soon?  What?  By the way, good morning, Chicago, because this is Chicago's own Karen Meyer. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, but we're pointing out that she is just on the TV for ratings.  Oh, this is our disclaimer.  Huh?  This is our disclaimer?  Or is this our make ourselves feel okay when we walk home later?  No, I don't really give a crap.  I don't either.  But the reality is, you know, they're presenting it one way,  but it really is a way to get you to watch their news.  Yeah, it's a modern day freak show.  It's Ringling Brothers.  It's one of those gimmicks. 
[01:59:30]  It's something to bring the people into the big top.  So if this station has a handicapped, a deaf reporter,  you're going to tune in because it's something odd, a little different.  Yeah.  By the way, Britney Spears' pictures are up on opianathlete.com.  Oh.  Okay.  So let's get right into it.  Karen Meyer reports on blind artists.  Speaking of the blind, what are they talking about with the money, Jimmy?  You have that story today.  There's a very interesting story here about how a judge,  Money, uh... 
[02:00:00]  Talks and bulls...  What?  No, that's not what he's saying.  Oh, I thought...  Judge Mathis would, though.  He's all full of sass.  Judge makes bills recognizable to the blind.  Make bills recognizable to the blind.  The government discriminates against blind people  by printing money that all look and feels the same,  a federal judge said.  Uh, U.S. District Judge Blah Blah  ordered the Treasury Department  to come up with ways for blind people to tell bills apart.  How about just get some trustworthy family members? 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, I don't even think you could get a trustworthy family member.  You think a family member's going to, like, rob a poor blind guy?  Sitting there going,  Could you, like, take all my 1s, 5s, 10s, 20s, whatever,  and put them in separate little money clips that I have for each one  with a little bit of braille on the front that tells me what it is  so I can reach them in my pocket.  I know I got the 5s.  And you think the family's just kind of,  Hey, let me grab this.  Either that...  Stealing money?  Either that or the guy at the corner store. 
[02:01:00]  Now, that's what I think.  I got a blind woman in my neighborhood,  and she goes about her business all day long.  She asks for help when she gets to the corner.  I've actually, believe it or not,  I've helped her across the street a few times.  And I see her going to the stores, buying stuff.  How do you know what she's buying?  Now you've got to trust the counter person to give you the right change.  How in the hell does she know what she's buying?  How does she know what aisle to go into?  She's got to figure it out.  I don't know.  I don't watch her,  but she comes out with groceries,  and it looks like what she wanted.  That blindness is a bitch. 
[02:01:30]  Maybe it's just a surprise.  Every day, you don't know what you're eating.  You want milk, and you come out with a watermelon?  I mean, I think you can kind of figure it out.  Pouring antifreeze on your cereal?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Right.  I think I'm with the blind on this one.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  I think you've got to help him out a little bit.  I think it would be pretty easy, you know,  at the Mint, where they print up all the cash.  Yeah, one little operation where you put a few little dents in the money 
[02:02:00]  or something like that.  A few little bumps.  Like different sizes?  Just something?  Just a little different?  Different sizes.  Slow down.  Why?  Because that's a pain in the ass thing.  You're trying to count your money,  and it's different sizes?  They do it in other countries.  Every country does it.  Every country is stupid with their stupid square money  and then different sizes to Canada with that huge bill.  That's dumb money.  We have great money here.  The money is a human ear.  I'd like two lobes worth, please. 
[02:02:30]  All you'd have to do is put little bumps on the corners of the money,  where it actually says, you know, five or ten.  You put little braille bumps there.  Raise the seal a little bit.  So they know.  You touch it, and there it is.  There it is.  Feels like warts.  Yeah, little money warts.  Grab your hogs.  She thinks it's a hundred.  There's Stan's laugh that we love.  Karen Meyer reports on blind artists.  Hello, Chicago.  Here we go.  The best artists use their vision to create their work. 
[02:03:00]  That also includes...  Oh, yeah.  By the way, we play a little game called Guess When Karen Meyer Speaks.  Guess When Karen Speaks.  Obviously, it's not the guy's voice, but it could be the woman I hear.  Yeah, I wasn't sure if that was the woman there.  The best artists use their vision to create their work.  That also includes those with vision lost.  No.  No.  And ABC7's Karen Meyer is here to explain the story.  This morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Thanks, Dan, Kevin.  For the past five years, guilt for the blind, past, and its focus has been showcased in the 
[02:03:30]  work of talented artists.  What?  What?  Fix the audio.  What?  Something's wrong.  Something happened.  The tape is playing slow.  Yeah, I'm playing it off a real.  The record's warped.  I'm playing it off a reel-to-reel, and it's wobbly.  Yeah.  It's wobbly.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Needs a little adjustment here.  I can't understand what she's saying.  I don't know what she's saying.  I'm sorry.  Enough with the hate email when we do this.  This is for you to make sure you're watching so you can point and laugh. 
[02:04:00]  We all want to point and laugh, but there's people out there that don't want to admit  that.  She's walking around with two change purses on the sides of her head.  They pick up no sound.  Nothing.  Do you understand?  If you shoot sound at a sneaker, it does the same thing as her ears.  Picture, look at a wire above the street when sneakers are dangling worthlessly around  it.  Picture those on top of a human head.  Try to talk to those sneakers.  You'll get the same response. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, just a dumb tongue and laces staring back at you.  There's no sound processing going on.  Someone is screaming debit cards.  You still got to trust the person when you hand over your debit card if you're blind.  Yeah, they might just pay more.  They might just put...  Oh, well, yeah, I guess...  See, that's a problem now.  Why?  Who cares about the cash?  What if you're using credit like a lot of people do?  Thank you.  Or debit cards.  Now you got trouble.  They could charge you more.  Yeah.  Two million dollars for eggs.  Sign here.  Let's go back to Karen Meyer. 
[02:05:00]  The best gift for the blind, passionate focus has been showcasing the work of talented  artists who are legally blind by using their artistic skills that provide an insight of  their vision.  Watching the news should not be work.  This is such hard work.  What if you wanted to know about blind artists?  You got to...  You're not understanding.  Oh, my goodness.  Don't tell me they're painting.  Don't tell me they're painting. 
[02:05:30]  They're blind.  I can understand if they're doing a little sculpture or something.  I can understand that.  You can kind of feel what you're doing.  You can feel...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can use some of your artistic talent to do something, but...  Why is she on the news?  You know what she should be doing?  She should be laying on her side on a coffee table, and important people should be flicking  their ashes into her ear.  You're implying her ear is as worthless to hearing as an ashtray.  You know what her ear should be? 
[02:06:00]  It should be featured in a painting with fruit sticking out of it.  It's a worthless appendage.  Well, was she done?  I couldn't even tell.  I don't know.  What is it?  Let's forget it.  A Canadian is calling you a dope.  What?  Canadian money is the same size as you asked, just different colors.  It's big. 
[02:06:30]  You stupid loony.  What's your stupid loonies?  Your money's too pretty.  Bring me a Canadian dollar.  Oh, of course.  You have one?  Of course.  I mean, you have fruit.  Oh, what a goody two-shoes.  You got a loony?  And a toonie.  And a toonie.  What's a toonie?  I guess it's two loonies.  Take this away.  You have no bills, though?  That's right.  No paper money?  How about a coonie?  All right.  Let's get back to this. 
[02:07:00]  Santa's a moonie.  They provide an insight of their vision.  Looking at the art on display, you will never know they were created by blind artists.  They represent the best of the best.  This year, 161 pieces were submitted by 49 artists.  47 were selected by a team of judges.  Chicago area artist David Simpson, working down before the climb.  What?  I totally didn't understand.  That's when I start to see my way out. 
[02:07:30]  And this is kind of what this painting is representing.  Like a magi-glutant generation.  They should be mixing paint in her ears.  Just the blind artists mixing different colors.  You know what she should be?  A Texan should be taking her ear and putting it to his mouth and spitting his shoe into it.  Old tobacco juice ears.  Here comes the hate mail.  Bring it on. 
[02:08:00]  But we don't get it.  I'm sorry.  No one understands what she's saying.  Tell old tobacco juice ears to write the copy and send it to somebody who talks right.  It's just too much work after a long day at the office.  I forget to hear.  I forget to hear.  Hey, fruit dish head.  Nobody is listening to you.  When a toilet backs up, you should take her head sideways, put it in, and just try to plunge the block away, the blockage with that ear.  Grab her hair on the left side, put her right ear over the hole in the bongle. 
[02:08:30]  Why are you going to shut your mouth?  Hey, a blind photographer blows up pictures to see them.  Oh.  I've heard about these blind photographers.  They just freaking...  Blows up a picture.  Just to hang on the side of the Verrazano to get a good look.  Cool.  That's a bridge for the rest of America.  is out of focus pictures.  You should have went local. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, out of focus.  You should have went...  I don't even know what the Verrazano is.  No, you should have went San Francisco local.  Golden Gate?  Golden Gate.  Yeah, go Golden Gate.  I think it was depressing.  But screw San Francisco with their tiny little wow stickers.  Little tiny stickers.  Brooklyn Bridge.  Everyone knows that one.  Brooklyn Bridge.  There you go.  No, I'm just busting it.  I should have said it really strong.  It's a bridge.  You should hang it off the gothals.  Yeah.  How about that bridge going into Trenton with that sign?  Trenton makes the world takes.  Does it?  That's a sign in Trenton.  That's something to be proud of.  It's awful. 
[02:09:30]  What do they make?  Criminals?  What is the...  I think they make marshmallows.  What is the needlepoint capital of Jersey or something?  That's right.  When you're going towards the Lincoln Tunnel.  Oh, you see.  It's like, welcome to the needlepoint capital of the country.  I could not think of a bigger who cares.  That's like saying your town is home to the biggest testicular cancer ever found.  They have like a yarn ball.  You can actually hold it and weigh it.  That's what Karen could do. 
[02:10:00]  She could just store knitting needles in her ears.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's learn about blind photographers.  Whole umbrella rack.  Just have her lay on the floor.  What she ought to do is she ought to put her ear under a microscope and let them examine  things.  Old Petri dish head.  That's what her ear is.  It's a Petri dish with a coverless Petri dish.  No one understands what you're saying.  Oh, no.  But they clean out her ears with a hammer and a needle. 
[02:10:30]  Blind photography.  Here we go.  Yeah, blind photography.  Who taught us a photographer from Oregon?  Can we start over, please?  Why?  From the beginning of the newscast.  I don't know what's happening.  She's talking in pig Latin.  What are you saying?  As she's talking right now, there's an aborigine tribe nodding their heads.  We get it, Karen.  We get it.  What's she saying?  I don't know.  Talk it to the aliens. 
[02:11:00]  All right.  How does she talk dirty in bed?  You know what her whole sex life must be?  What?  Aliens on Mars are going, finally, we know what they're talking about.  Finally.  We're talking about a photographer from Oregon.  He has been blind since birth.  Three of his photos were selected.  Holy crap.  What?  All I heard was he has been blind since birth.  And I had to try so hard to hear that. 
[02:11:30]  Listen for the first five seconds.  What is she saying right here?  We're talking about a photographer from Oregon.  He has been blind since birth.  Someone from Oregon.  All right.  Oregon, blind from birth.  You know what her ears are?  They should be cut off and put on a gentleman's smoking jacket.  The elbow part.  All elbow patch ears.  Your ears should be on the elbows of a gentleman's smoking jacket.  Get me my pipe and her ears. 
[02:12:00]  I'm going to retire to the study.  We can't.  We can't get enough of this, bro.  Those ears are just of no value.  None.  He has been blind since birth.  Three of his photos were selected.  This one was shot as just a tree next to a park because it goes slow.  I have no idea.  No.  I don't want to know.  We're not backing it up anymore.  You know what we should do with her ears?  What?  Cut them off and put them in the hands of a small wind-up monkey so he can smack them together. 
[02:12:30]  That's right.  Old chimp cymbal ears.  How do you like them apples?  It wouldn't go, it would just kind of go, make a silent little noise for those cymbals that scare the children.  This would be nice for children that don't like loud noises.  You know what you should do with her ears?  You cut them off and you put them in your scrap album next to yesterday's baseball game tickets because they're as worthless as they are. 
[02:13:00]  They also have no value.  Yeah.  Good idea.  You know what I want to do?  I want to cut her ears off and sew them together from where they were cut off from the head.  Wind a string around it and have an ear yo-yo.  Just, it would be more fun and worthwhile. 
[02:13:30]  Can we get to-  Put those ears to some good.  Can we get through this clip so we can get out of here?  Okay.  We'll try.  The light was perfect.  I took my time.  I took the image and noticed my shadow in it and decided to leave that in.  So it's kind of a self-portrait.  That's a trial.  Push you.  No one understands you.  Excuse me, one second.  I want to spray paint her ear white, cut it off and put it over my nose when I go to the beach.  Old sunblock ear. 
[02:14:00]  You know what?  I'm getting a facial.  Can I cut your ears off and put them over my eyes while they apply cream to my face?  Stupid cuke ears.  Old cucumber slice ears.  Oh, I like to just punch her ears repeatedly.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Joe?  Her drawer full of unused iPod buds.  Joe?  Joe?  Hello?  Are you deaf? 
[02:14:30]  No, my brother is.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry to hear that.  God bless him.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, if you had the poor guy, when he talks, he sounded like a retard.  I'd feel so bad for him.  Jesus.  I know it's funny, but it's not funny.  Of course it's not funny.  Very sad.  Yeah, get out of here.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  Only in New York, though.  When he talks, he sounds like a retard.  How did your brother go down?  Hey, we've got to get out of here.  Can we get through this clip?  Oh, my God. 
[02:15:00]  You know what I want to do with her ear?  I want to bring it to my eye doctor so I can rest my chin in it, because the next time he  does the test in my eyeball, to test my eyeball pressure.  Well, the rest of the clip's going to have to wait until tomorrow. 
[02:15:30]  Two worthless chin straps she has.  That's where your head is.  It's supporting two chin straps.  Well, yeah, we'll have to wait.  Yeah, we've got a couple more to do tomorrow.  Someone remind us to do that, all right?  Also tomorrow, Jet, Joe Rogan's sitting in.  He's great.  Don't forget about the eggnog drinking contest on Friday.  Lots of radio still to do this week.  We really appreciate the support, guys.

[02:17:00]  There's girls that wear little skirts in the cold.  Why do girls still wear skirts when it's cold out?  Because they're trying to get a raise.  Is that it?  Yeah.  A lot of people for the walk today, by the way.  We got Flea.  He's going to try to get into the eggnog drinking contest.  He's going to try to drink like a gallon of milk or whatever until he pukes today.  Also, we got a blind listener for the walk today.  Oh, yeah?  Half blind.  Half blind?  Half blind.  One eye. 
[02:17:30]  One eye.  Krista, the blind girl, sends her best.  Oh, you know Krista, the blind girl?  Absolutely.  Very, very good friends with her, yes.  She's a whore, right?  She's a goer.  She's totally a goer.  Wow.  She's got a wild side to her.  You knew that she was.  Is she hot?  Is she hot?  She's all right looking.  She gets that.  You can't talk at the same time.  You're not deaf.  You're blind.  That's right.  Well, half blind.  Yeah.  Well, shut the fuck up so I can talk that.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, half blind?  All pussy whipped.  Massive boobs.  How big are those?  42H. 
[02:18:00]  42H.  Show them.  Wow, they are really.  It is Wednesday.  Come on.  Shut up.  I'm not showing my tits.  Why?  I love the blind guy going, show them.  Yeah, because he actually watched me bang one of my ex-girlfriends on his couch.  Whip them out.  Whip them out.  Wait, wait.  There's a lot going on here.  You have 42Hs and the blind guy watched you bang your old girlfriend on a couch?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're very close, so.  Yeah.  I haven't banged him, though.  No.  No.  He's too blind for me. 
[02:18:30]  She's not physically attracted to me.  I love him like a brother that I wouldn't fuck.  He kept putting his dick in her belly button.  I love him like a brother that I wouldn't fuck.  Jesus.  She wants to bang Uncle Paul.  That's what she really wants.  I would totally go for Uncle Paul.  Really?  Actually, my ex-boyfriend kind of looks like you, and I had a thing for you a while because  of that, but I hope you don't have a small penis like he does.  Hi, Brian.  Oh.  Nice.  Brian with the small hog.  No, I don't.  Why don't you just not whip him out, but unbutton the vest. 
[02:19:00]  I'm going to show my tits.  No, just the vest so he can see it through the sweater.  You're a redhead, too, by the way.  Wow.  I'm going to be the very bad news, but there's NYPD brass on the corner.  Don't you?  I'm going to really take pictures of my tits right now.  This is fucking crazy.  These won't be on the internet.  Kenny.  Oh, yeah.  They won't be on the internet.  With some fucking bad news.  That means I'm going to be on whack bag with my tits out.  I don't want to be the bigger bad news, but there's NYPD brass on the corner.  On the corner.  And, you know, I don't want to have to tell you twice. 
[02:19:30]  You get arrested.  I don't know how much your tits are on TV.  By the way, blind guy loves the Islanders.  Season tickets, man.  Section 301.  He has no idea he's been watching the Rangers for the last 15 years.  Oh, man.  It's true.  One eye you can see out of?  One eye.  This one.  How good?  How good?  Yeah.  I can see your face.  I can see, I don't know, I can see buildings.  Please tell me you sit in the back row and save money.  Faces in buildings.  What?  Where do you sit? 
[02:20:00]  Wouldn't it be ironic if a puck took the other eye out at you?  301 behind the penalty box.  Like, on the penalty box side.  Towards the Islander goal.  301.  You're not seeing anything?  The big logo at center ice, I can see that.  Oh, my God.  The blue lines, you can see that.  All right.  What does it matter as long as they speak?  You know what I want to do?  Yeah.  I want to take Karen Meyer's ears and put them in a box with your eye and make a game where  you've got to roll your eye into her useless ear holes.  Hey, what are they filming?  Like a little metal ball.  Yeah.  What are they filming over there? 
[02:20:30]  Oh, wow.  Anyone know?  Are they doing a movie?  There is a movie going on.  Let's go check it out.  Let's just go make noise by it.  NYPD ain't yapping.  They are not talking today.  It's Gridlock Alert Day.  Yes.  It's because of all the shopping.  Maybe they're filming a commercial.  I don't think our mics are going to...  Do our mics make it over there around the corner?  No.  It's only a half a block.  Is it a line of sight?  Let's go this way and see how far they... 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  Because I want to get to the bottom of this.  We're walking down 57th Street.  Instead of going down 57th, we're going to go up 6th Avenue to 58th.  Right until our mics...  But there are a lot of buildings here, so you get a little ricochet action.  Well, perhaps that'll work and help us.  We'll keep talking until the mics crackle out.  So far, so good, right?  Right by Jekyll and Hyde here in New York City.  It's a restaurant. 
[02:21:30]  Get off the phone.  That's some guy who once stole my credit card when I went there to eat.  Did he?  And charged $800 for a cell phone.  That was nice of you.  Yeah.  You know, it was Amex.  I didn't have to pay.  We're getting there.  We're almost there.  Here we go.  It's crackling a little.  Crackling.  A little crackle.  A little crackle.  A little crackle.  A little crackle.  All right.  And that's about as far as we're getting.  Walk slow.  Two set.  Wow.  Oh, they're filming inside?  What are they filming?  Yeah, I see some lights inside. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, it's probably some commercial.  What are you guys filming today?  Hi.  Hi.  What are you filming?  I got a camera.  Look at Sam.  I got a camera.  I'm like you.  I got a camera.  I'm making motion pictures.  I make movies, too.  With my camera.  Here comes Club Soda Kenny to tell us what they're filming today.  Kenny, what's the info?  It's a movie called Girl in the Park, but they're mum about who's in it.  Oh, really?  No.  How would they say who's in it? 
[02:22:30]  We'll plug it.  We're a radio show.  They don't care.  It's not going to come out for like two years.  Yeah.  Who's in the movie?  Oh, they're just...  Who are we going to see?  How come everyone that works on movie sets thinks they're fucking stars?  Too cool for the room?  Yeah, I don't know.  I hate movie people.  They make them believe we're not standing here yelling at them.  They're setting up all the lighting now.  I want to know who's in it.  What's the movie called?  Girl in the Park. 
[02:23:00]  Girl in the Park.  I hope it's about the Central Park Jogger and it's a comedy.  You can look it up on IMDB.  I'm sure it's there and that'll be who's in it.  All right.  They're not filming anytime soon.  No, they're just doing the lights.  All right.  But I say we make it a point to badmouth this cunty movie.  That's right.  That movie sucks.  Miss, they're filming a movie there.  Do you know who's in it?  They won't tell us.  Sigourney Weaver.  Sigourney Weaver.  Oh, why would they tell us that?  Oh, Sigourney Weaver.  Is she in there now? 
[02:23:30]  You show me.  I just came down to get coffee.  How'd you know she was in it?  Hey.  One of the guys told me.  Well, he told you, but he wouldn't tell us.  Look at her.  She just walks away from me.  That's good.  She should have.  I was telling Billie Jean Kay.  Kick her down the subway stairs.  Go ahead.  Kick her right down those fucking subway steps.  Let's see.  Cast and credits.  Kate Bosworth.  Ah.  Sigourney Weaver.  Ah.  Kerry Russell.  Alessandro Novella.  I don't know the rest of those people. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  What's it about?  Why don't you tell us?  Roland, what's it about?  Mother enduring traumatized by disappearance of her three-year-old daughter 15 years ago.  Has cut herself off from her ex-husband and son.  However, when a troubled young woman with a checkered past enters her life, old psychic  wounds painfully resurface.  All right.  So it's a comedy.  What does that have to do with that fucking store?  I know.  Where does that store come into play? 
[02:24:30]  Maybe that's where the kid is working as a clerk.  Maybe the three-year-old stayed three and is working as a clerk.  You know what I like to do?  I like to find that three-year-old and cut off Karen Meyer's ears and hang them above  the kid's crib so he can swat at them like they're a little mobile.  Jimmy, you can't get enough of her, huh?  I want to take Karen's ear, cut it off, fill it with vodka, take your eye, put a toothpick 
[02:25:00]  through it, and drop it in with a little vermouth.  Old martini glass ear.  Why are you rubbing salt around my ear rims?  Look at this traffic.  No, have fun.  It'll be fun to do.  You cut her ears off and you hold them together and you fuck them. 
[02:25:30]  That's right, pocket pussy ears.  You heard what I said.  Or did she?  No, she didn't hear anything.  Someone signed that to her when they see her.  That's right.  Oh.  Hey, Jason Alexander.  Hey.  There he is.  Wow, does he look retarded.  Racist.  I'm not buying none of that Seinfeld.  Why do these security guards always have these awful patches on their jackets?  Oh, big and gaudy. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, big stupid hamper circle patch.  Gives us the look like he could actually do something.  Oh, stop.  What are you going to do?  That's right.  Useless.  With your patch.  Oh, here's Broom Boy.  There he is.  Mr. Whipple.  Shouldn't you be wiping a child's memory out?  Hey, bring the blind kid to Starbucks and make believe he's seeing the show.  Well, another big long line for the elevator for some reason.  I like to cut her ears off and put them behind a counter and throw a tire on them. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, someone did.  Her ears are more useful than this guy.  Oh, he's a bum.  Morning.  Morning, everybody.  Good morning.  Good morning to the elevator line.  Good morning.  Oh, it's going to take forever.  We'll see you guys upstairs.  Odean Revenue XM202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Enkle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe. 
[02:27:00]  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol CM. 
[02:27:30]  Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:28:00]  Enough with the walking from studio to studio.  I've had it.  I'm going to need a portable mic for a few minutes. 
[02:28:30]  Wait, what are you doing?  Oh, boy.  I haven't been shitting.  When I shit, I'm fucking regular.  I don't have diarrhea.  But I just, it's been, they've been fucking awful.  Like when I take dumps now, I got to fucking break them off constantly because there's  nothing moving internally.  Oh, no.  So I think I got to go get colonics again every couple of years.  You got to break them off?  Yeah, they're awful.  Yeah.  You feel like they're coming out and then all of a sudden it just stops.  Yeah, you still know you got 11 or 12 pounds lodged in there. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, that hurts.  Yeah.  You get the headaches yet?  No.  No, no.  It's only a day or two.  The lack of crapping?  I'll see you guys in a minute.  I just need a portable mic.  All right, Jimmy.  Enjoy.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  Enjoy.  Tiddly, a, ta, ta.  Get him a mic.  Enjoy.  Very good.  I am starting a peltor.  Oh, Fred.  And reports coming in, the mics weren't crackling at all.  No?  It was just our headphones.  Oh.  Crackling.  Because over the air, it sounded fine.  Oh, really? 
[02:29:30]  My inside source.  Very good.  Good to know.  Okay.  Dude, they opened my, my, join my room, and there they are.  All the pal talkers.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Hey, Max.  How are you today?  Hey there, Max.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Max.  Yeah, I would like to take Karen Meyer's ear, cut it off, paint it black, and put it over  the lens of my 35 millimeter camera. 
[02:30:00]  A lens cover.  Just use her useless appendage as a lens cover.  Ah, there's a million of them.  There's so many uses.  Yeah.  It's like Tupperware.  You know, if I had a parrot on my shoulder, I'd like to push her ear over my right eye.  Jimmy?  Yeah, buddy?  Where are you?  I'm in a bad trim, Opie.  I hear Uncle Paul is in the stall next to you.  Huh?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Just cut out. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, boy.  I, I hear Uncle Paul is in the stall next to you?  Why?  No, I, wouldn't he be hanging in?  Is my head, is my mic on or no?  Are you ready?  Yes.  Yes.  Are you ready to rock?  No, my earphone, my, my, I just, I cut off.  My headphone's cut off.  Can I have headphones?  Oh, my God.  Get him headphones.  Holy shit.  Oh, my.  No, I mean, I can't hear anything, so I didn't want to, uh, I don't want to be yapping.  Jimmy, Jimmy, we're here, we're here. 
[02:31:00]  Jimmy!  Where are you?  Jimmy, can you hear us?  Now I can, but I couldn't in the bathroom.  Oh.  The whole thing, I, you know who I felt like, don't you?  Yes, Karen Meyer.  I couldn't understand anything you were saying.  And what you're going to lay in that bowl?  I might as well tape it to the side of my head.  All right.  Let me try it again here.  There's fucking things.  I hope they work.  Jimmy, all I was saying is, uh, Uncle Paul's in the stall next to you.  That's all.  I was warning you.  Hold on.  I need, I'm sorry.  I need the door.  Can I have the door open, please? 
[02:31:30]  Oh, boy.  Door open?  Why the door open?  I don't know, so I don't shit in the hallway?  Oh.  Oh, he's not even in the bathroom yet.  I just came back in and said, why isn't the door open?  Why?  Let's say hi to Dan in North Carolina.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to see if maybe at some point today you may be able to play Kenny's act  that got him in trouble in the past.  Oh, that.  Oh, that thing.  We haven't played that in a while.  Wow.  That's probably part of the settlement.  Yeah.  That it never see the light of day again.  Yeah, we'll figure that out, Dan. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  Thanks, guys.  We haven't talked about that in a while, but maybe we can later on.  Anything.  Yeah, I need something, Kenny.  What do you suggest?  Well.  Yogurt, pork, fat?  No.  Fresh fruit?  Yeah, fresh fruit.  Jimmy.  How you doing?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  What's up?  Jimmy was in there.  You know, I remember.  I remember when she was just a little girl.  She'd go to the bathroom, and she'd never know how to wipe good enough, so I'd have to  help her out.  She'd cry a little. 
[02:32:30]  Sometimes there was a little blood mixed in.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Not right.  He's gruesome.  Uncle Paul, you see Jimmy in the stall next to you?  Oh, he's pushing. 
[02:33:00]  He's really pushing.  Yeah, I am.  I got a nice one.  Breathe.  Breathe and push.  I am.  I'm trying, but it's all mushed up in there, but it's coming out in perfect little logs.  Don't strain.  Is it coming out like milk duds?  Yeah, like plink.  Plink.  Bloop, bloop.  Bloop, bloop.  I feel like I got a bunch in there, too.  It feels like there's one piece lodged sideways.  Ah, a blockage. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Anthony, Bill from Philly is still communicating with me personally from yesterday.  I'll get you a stamp!  Just secret message.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He can't find a stamp.  I would...  I need to get him a stamp immediately.  Yeah.  Jimmy...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You fucking plinkhole pellet shit. 
[02:34:00]  Come on.  Like a rabbit.  Shit like a man, for God's sake.  Come on, Jimmy.  Come on, Jim.  We're rooting for you.  Push that stomach.  Start prodding.  Grab...  Grab your...  Come on, we can do it.  Grab your right knee and pull it up toward your belly and bend over.  Squeeze it out like toothpaste.  Like fucking space food.  I told you you could do it. 
[02:34:30]  Well, Uncle Paul's back.  He's talking him through it.  Sometimes when a little boy or a little girl is blocked up, you gotta put your finger in.  Work it out so the little fella feels better.  Oh, my God.  He's doing good.  Yeah.  Better boy.  Jimmy, uh...  Nah, I'm blocked up.  Nah.  I'm sitting here now.  I'm just kind of relaxing on the toilet, listening to my favorite radio show.  Yeah.  Did you have to cut it off?  Of course I did.  It was fucking...  Oh, no.  Now it's gonna be a mess, right?  It was eight feet and I got two inches out. 
[02:35:00]  Right now, I'm just sitting on the bowl.  That's the worst.  All right, Jimmy.  I'll keep you posted.  All right.  Uh, Jim Norton in the bathroom.  Brother Joe, what's up?  My ass last night was blowing like a fucking salad shooter.  Oh, nice.  Oh.  It was nasty.  We're down here in Santa Fe, uh, in, uh...  Yes, Santa Fe.  We're down here in College Park, Maryland.  We played at the Santa Fe Cafe last night.  And, uh...  I ate the nachos.  I made a mistake.  Did you get pictures on that?  Mmm.  Um...  It comes out the way it went in. 
[02:35:30]  Exactly.  Uh, what I called about was, uh, whack bag, man.  Those guys really put me over the top with that Volkswagen contest.  Yeah?  What is the contest about, Joe?  It's a shredding, uh, it's a guitar shredding contest.  You go on and you, uh...  It's pretty much just, uh, you know, blowing out 30 seconds of, uh, guitar playing.  Real fast leads.  It's kind of...  What they did on, uh, you guys have seen the Volkswagen commercials.  Yeah, the commercials.  Who was in there? 
[02:36:00]  Slash did one.  And, uh...  Nigel.  Nigel from Spinal Tap.  He did one.  John Mayer did one.  And, uh, basically, uh, you enter a 30-second video and, uh, you're up against, uh, you know,  a ton of other players.  And I'm down to the final eight so far.  Ooh.  Hey, what happens if you win the whole thing?  You win a pre-shredded, um, first act, uh, limited edition.  It's in black-on-black guitar.  Limited edition.  Like, I need another one. 
[02:36:30]  I have, like, I have, like, 40 of them.  About 40 guitars at this point.  But it's a, uh, it's pre-shredded by Slash and Sign in, uh, like a silver Sharpie.  Pre-shredded?  Pre-shredded.  Pre-shredded.  But, uh, I'm gonna be, uh, I'm gonna be in the finals now, so I just wanted to thank  everyone on Wackback for voting me in, man.  All right, what can they do for you, Joe?  Yeah, now what?  Now what?  You send in a video and they choose?  No, I already choose.  Now it's just all up on Volkswagen.com. 
[02:37:00]  That's wagon with an E-N.  Well, that's what I'm saying, so the pest could still vote for you.  Oh, hell yeah.  Okay, that's what I mean by now what?  Let them roll.  All right, good.  Now it gets to, uh, now I, you know, the semifinals, then the finals, and then, uh, one person  becomes Uber Rock God, and, uh, you end up with your, with your face and some TV up on  top of, uh, on top of a big pile of TV sets on the website.  Very good.  I got that going for me, which is nice. 
[02:37:30]  Which is nice.  All right, good luck.  Thanks, guys.  Thank Godspeed.  All right.  All right, man.  Coming back from Maryland.  See you later.  Brother Joe, everybody.  Touring, uh, touring the country.  Jimmy, I...  You two cover band.  I noticed by the audio, you're still in the bathroom.  Yeah, I'm sitting here, and it's like, oh, I got something coming, but it's like, it's  all thick.  It's like shitting, like, bubble gum.  Ah.  It's really annoying.  Is it too big to come out, or is it just the consistency? 
[02:38:00]  It's...  Or are you tightening up?  Once it comes out, it's shaped like logs.  I mean, so it's not like it's all mushy.  I just think that there's...  Try something I'm eating that's been binding me up, where the whole track needs to be loosened  up with a good colonic.  I may go for some more colonics, and get some water shot in there, and just get the whole  track moist and bacteria-free.  You need a raisin bran, my friend.  You think so?  Kellogg's raisin bran.  Yeah.  Or post.  Yeah.  Yes.  Raisin bran is brutal. 
[02:38:30]  Raisin bran will just...  I can't eat it anymore.  That will...  Makes you shit?  Oh, my God.  Within minutes.  Really?  It's amazing.  It's ridiculous.  Well, it looks like someone's going to be eating raisin bran from now on.  You know what I like to do?  Take a Karen Meyer ear and fill it, keepin' helpin', right to the tippity-top brim with  raisin bran and a little milk.  Well, speaking of Karen Meyer, the listeners really are chomping at the bit.  Chomping at her ear.  Jeremy in Cleveland, what's up? 
[02:39:00]  Hey, hello, bu-bu-bu-boys.  What's up, Jeremy?  I just wanted to say, it's raining here today, so I need an umbrella, so I think I need to  borrow Karen Meyer's ears.  And use them as an umbrella.  Isn't that a little small?  Yeah.  I don't think you're quite getting...  Yeah, yeah.  ...quite getting...  Yeah.  Maybe her ears are giant.  All right, let's go to Rob in Richmond.  Rob!  Good morning, boy.  Hey.  Hey, I want to cut off Karen Meyer's ear and use it as a yarmulke.  Ah, see?  Maybe he has to go to Temple.  Ah, no. 
[02:39:30]  No?  Still a little small.  Yeah, sir.  Why don't you just jump out of a plane with her ear?  Oh, you can stretch it out a little bit.  It's a parachute.  Why don't you use it as a magic carpet?  No.  What her fucking...  Silly goose.  What her ear is good for...  Yeah.  Yeah, listen to Jimmy do it.  Jimmy is perfect.  Like, let's say you're having some friends over.  Yeah.  And you have four junior mints, and you have no place to put them.  You use that worthless dish-like appendage, and you put four or five junior mints in  it.  Very good.  All right, there's a great example.  The listener's still not getting it.  Umbrella, too big.  Yarmulke, too big. 
[02:40:00]  Could you maybe take one, put it on your night table, and throw your extra change in there  at the end of the night?  See, ashtray, change holder.  Just things like that.  Right.  Let's go to Christina in Washington.  Christina.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  What's up?  Hey.  I want to get Karen Meyer's ear, roll it up, and use it as a tampon.  Oh.  I, uh, wow.  That can kind of work. 
[02:40:30]  Jimmy's.  Do you know that I had to get this pair of tight shoes?  Thank God I had one of Karen Meyer's ear.  I put it on my heel, and slip that tight shoe right on.  See, Jimmy's perfect.  That'll work.  Very accurate every time, Jimmy.  DJ New Style, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  My mom actually likes to use Karen Meyer ears to slide furniture along the living room.  She puts them under the leg.  And it doesn't scratch the floor.  No, and it makes it really easy to push.  There you go.  See? 
[02:41:00]  Punch it out.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Should we, uh, take a break, Jimmy?  What's going on in there?  Uh, I'm still just dropping basically a slow, it's like a slow pile.  It's like a frozen yogurt pile.  Really slow, uh, and thick, and full of carbs.  And my headphones are going out.  So.  All right.  All right.  We'll take a, uh, a break.  We should, right?  Until Jimmy can wipe.  Okay.  Because it's going to take him a while if he cut off.  Oh, I'm going to have to, yeah.  Yeah, you're really going to have to clean up.  Wait, we do have Whitetail that might have one. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  He's following Jim's, uh, example.  Yes, Whitetail.  My wife was thinking that she could use Karen Meyer here for a diaphragm.  Well, there you go.  How you shove it up in there?  There you go.  You would have to, you would have to sew shut that useless canal, that opening.  That sound could not possibly pass through.  I think it's actually already sewed shut.  I don't think you'd need to.  Yeah, the canal couldn't be open.  Because nothing gets through.  Punch it out, boys. 
[02:42:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  The canal has been fucking sealed off like a road to Syria.  Hey, we've got blind guy up here.  Half blind.  He's facing the window.  He thinks he's seeing the show.  Turn him around.  Turn him this way, will you?  He's looking at the buildings outside, saying, which one's Opie?  And we've got Flea here.  Old Aggie eye.  Flea is going to try to enter the eggnard drinking contest. 
[02:42:30]  Good luck.  Last minute stuff, right?  Skinny little guy.  But he only has a quart of milk.  That's all it's going to take him.  No, we've got to get more milk for Flea.  We've got to get some good puking today.  All right, Jimmy.  We'll see you in a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.

[02:43:00]  Jump around.  Jump around.  Jump around.  Opie and Anthony.  Let's get Flea in here.  Jimmy's back.  Do you have enough milk to drink?  Milk.  We got more milk.  What?  More milk coming?  I can't hear.  The metallic is too loud. 
[02:43:30]  That is loud.  I love this song, though.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  Double sitting?  My crack hurts.  Does it?  Like, you know how your ass, when you wipe it, but it's like it's sore now?  But you got to take a little water on the tissue and dab a little to cool off and get  away any stomach acids that might be burning.  It feels like I was walking with a potato chip between my ass cheeks and chafing.  Yeah.  Swamp ass?  No, no, not bad.  Just burning.  I'm hungry.  You got any potato chips back there? 
[02:44:00]  No.  Rhino Fez joke.  Oh, really?  Just ripping off.  Yeah.  Sorry, we all out.  Try to steal as much.  Oh, thank you.  You returned with the Earl line.  How come no one likes you on the message board?  Yeah, why are you?  I'm opinionated and I'm an asshole.  I don't think it's the opinionated part.  I think it's the asshole part.  Yeah, you're really not liked.  You just rub people the wrong way.  I'm liked on FullBlownAids.com.  Are you not?  Yeah.  Yes, I am. 
[02:44:30]  Welcome.  Check it out.  I don't think you are.  Except I hate Doug Outdog.  He's my arch nemesis.  But he, like, runs the joint.  Yeah, but screw him.  Why do you hate him?  He's a dickhead.  And I...  What's up?  Talking to the mic.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm an ass.  I actually thought I was going to do this on the walkover, not here.  Oh.  Well, we got a little caught up.  You are opinionated, but you don't have anything.  No opinion.  Any substance behind it.  That's the problem.  We ask you what's wrong with Doug Outdog and you go, he's a...  What?  Well, uh...  He's a dick.  Have you ever seen his wife? 
[02:45:00]  Very hot.  I don't think she is.  Oh, she's sexy.  You're nuts, dude.  She spends too long in the tanning booth.  Wow, yeah, there's a bad thing for a chick to be tan.  What are you, like fucking dead girls?  Doug Outdog, if he wasn't so big, I would offer his wife money for sex.  She's fucking hot.  There you go.  He's really sexy.  Beat that, Flay.  Oh.  And what's your problem with the whack bag?  Uh, I don't know.  I'm not a big Stingray fan.  Why?  Why?  Because, uh, you ever watch, you ever see how he censors out a lot of it? 
[02:45:30]  Um, yeah, there are certain things that are, uh, yeah, taken out.  I think it's mostly because, uh, uh, like the word nigger gets taken out because you  don't want to pop in the word into a search engine and have that website come up.  Yeah, but why rape?  I don't know why rape.  I enjoy the word rape.  I say it all the time.  I enjoy the word, the activity.  The word, the activity.  I think, again, I think it was for a search engine thing.  That's, uh, his prerogative.  Whatever. 
[02:46:00]  But, uh, you know, it's a message board run by somebody that isn't you.  That's right.  So, why don't you make a message board?  Yeah.  I don't have the money or the time or the inclination.  Ah.  Ah.  So, don't you think people that do have the money, time, and inclination to do it can  run it however the fuck they please?  I assume.  You assume.  You make an ass out of you and you.  You assume.  Ooh.  All right, start drinking the milk.  No one likes you on the message board.  No one likes you.  I think you're all right.  All right.  Really?  I hate it on the message board.  Dude, you don't need a mic. 
[02:46:30]  Go in the corner.  You're like a corner guy for the show.  We just kind of throw you in the corner and we look at you every once in a while.  Let's see what the progress is.  Ah, let's do it.  But, Flea, really, why does everyone think that you're just a bag of shit?  I'm not knocking you because I think you're all right.  A bag of shit.  Well, they, basically, you know what you are?  You're a taller Karen Meyer ear.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  Also, I'm plugging MafiaLife.com.  Why?  Do you own that side or run it?  I got paid in lap dances to plug it. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  At least he was honest.  Payola.  How many?  That's nice.  $200 worth.  Did you cum in your pants?  No.  You're dumb.  What's wrong with you?  You got a dump in your pants.  That's the beauty of a lap dance.  You could just splooge right there in your pants?  You know how great it is to make her stand up with a little grease stain on the back of  her fucking leg?  That's right, toots.  I did it.  Teach her a little lesson.  All right.  Continue drinking that milk.  All right.  Here we go.  By the way, we got an update.  Remember, first half of the show, we needed to ask Al something. 
[02:47:30]  Al.  Al.  We never got the answer.  Well, we did get the answer, but we didn't tell the listeners.  The answer was no.  No.  Al took it to his place.  Flea is to message boards what Karen Meyer's ears are to a stethoscope.  Fucking useless.  You're drinking that milk.  Good boy.  Atta boy.  You're a good, strong young boy, Flea.  Big and strong.  Let's see what happens. 
[02:48:00]  Good smoothie.  We got to know, so we want to play it over here again.  Yeah.  It's a very funny rap.  The beauty of XM.  They're just being stupid over at Free Radio.  They are cutting their own fucking throats, commercial radio.  This is a funny thing.  You'd be in and out of it in two minutes, and they just, they don't understand.  It is very frustrating.  They don't understand.  We just sit there and go, all right, whatever.  Fine.  Play it at XM.  We don't care.  We'll just bring it over to XM.  You're hurting yourselves in the end.  Yep.  So here's a rap that is all over the internet.  It has something to do with, of course, Kramer, Michael Richards, and his tirade. 
[02:48:30]  You have a tirade?  What happened?  This was put together.  That is racism.  I'm not a racist.  That's what's so insane about this.  Nigger.  Nigger.  I'm not a racist.  That's what's so insane about this.  Look at the nigger.  Call me to talk.  Oh, my God.  I'm not a racist.  That's what's so insane about this. 
[02:49:00]  Nigger.  Nigger.  I'm not a racist.  That's what's so insane about this.  Look at the nigger.  50 years ago, you had your upside down.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Nigger.  50 years ago, you had your upside down.  Nigger.  Talking and talking and talking.  Nigger.  50 years ago, you had your upside down.  Nigger.  He mother fucker.  He mother fucker.  Walk up your ass.  Hey, walk up your ass.  50 years ago, you had your upside down.  I'm really busted.  I'll pull it in.  I'm really busted.  I'll pull it in.  Busted.  Busted. 
[02:49:30]  Busted.  I'm very, very, very, very sorry.  He's a piece of trash.  Lee Edward.  Nigger.  He's black, isn't he?  He is?  I'm black.  I thought he looked Irish.  What's his last name?  Nigger.  That's not Irish.  I'm not a racist.  That's what's so insane about this.  Nigger.  Nigger.  I'm not a racist.  That's what's so insane about this.  Luke is a nigger.  He's black, isn't he?  Nigger.  I'm black.  I'm not a racist.  That was the worst pause you've ever seen.  Get out of my mouth.  Oh, my God.  I should say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. 
[02:50:00]  A long while.  There you go.  That is put together really, really well.  And that's up on opandanthony.com.  Nice.  Very good.  And they don't want us playing it over at Free FM.  Idiots.  Bunch of dummies.  Dummies.  Yep.  What's wrong with that?  Huh?  What's wrong with that?  It goofs on the situation.  It's not nasty.  And it's kind of catchy.  It has a beat to it. 
[02:50:30]  And it's a rap song, which is fine.  I'm sure we could play a rap song over there.  You think we'd be able to play a rap song with Nigger in it?  Not now.  No?  Not right now.  Can't?  No.  Can't?  No, no, no.  Not until February.  February 12th, I believe.  How about hip-hop stations?  Can they play songs with that word in it?  No.  CBS-owned hip-hop?  They're probably self-editing.  Yeah?  I'm guessing they're self-editing, yeah.  That would be something to find out.  Flea, how are you doing over there? 
[02:51:00]  Pretty good.  They got more milk coming?  They got a quarter of it down already.  Huh?  No idea.  No idea.  All right, great.  Keep doing what you're doing.  No idea.  All right, violent video games.  This was on Good Morning America today.  New report says violent games should be kept from kids.  It's obviously the parent's responsibility.  You decide what a kid can play and what he can't play.  Take a peek in his room every once in a while.  Don't you know?  Look, see if they're online with the perverts. 
[02:51:30]  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul, you go online?  I love my computer.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Make a lot of friends.  Hello.  People come over.  They visit you.  You know, bounce them in your lap.  That's it.  You send pictures?  Yeah, I got pictures of my body.  Pictures of myself.  Sometimes a little girl likes to see what a man looks like with his undershorts off. 
[02:52:00]  I say, why don't you come over here?  I'll show you how to make a boy love you.  Little kiss.  Little kiss.  Oh my god.  Teach him how to French.  People are saying, please tell Flea he's not famous.  Flea, they're saying you're a bag of shit.  And what do you got?  Your cell phone out?  What are you doing?  I'm giving calls from everybody.  Oh, really?  Everybody and that...  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Everybody would be like a billion people.  Fucking Lead Belly keeps calling me.  Yeah, fucking Lead Belly.  That goddamn Lead Belly.  What's wrong with Lead Belly?  I have no idea.  I like the Lead Belly.  No.  All right, here we go.  Violent video games.  This season, beneath the Christmas trees and Hanukkah menorahs will lie millions of vividly violent video games.  Like...  You see how we had to change his tune?  Yeah.  I gotta hear that again.  Hanukkah menorahs will lie millions of vividly violent video games. 
[02:53:00]  Like Scarface.  The Sopranos.  Get out of there!  Go on.  And Saints Row.  Games rated M for mature, 17 years and older.  This brand new report from the National Institute on Media and the Family says games like this should be kept from kids.  And while it notes improvement by retailers refusing to sell such games to minors, it says the bigger problem is parents. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, enough, yeah.  Enough!  Bigger problem is parents.  What's the problem with parents?  They're not doing their job.  Yeah.  So they see their kid finally playing a violent video game and think it's awful and then go to the store and say,  Why are you selling these to my kids?  Ah, just leave it alone.  It doesn't do anything. 
[02:54:00]  It's entertainment.  The parents aren't doing their job because they know it's not doing anything to their children.  I think it's the responsibility of whoever is molesting the kid.  Right.  To make sure that they play proper video games when they come over.  Make sure they're the ones traumatizing the child the most.  Right.  Not some video game.  Let's go to Rico in Chicago.  Rico.  Rico.  Hey, Opie, Anthony.  How you doing?  Hey, Rico.  How you doing?  Good.  Good.  Hey, in regards to that hip-hop station letting the word nigger fly through, they edit that in Chicago. 
[02:54:30]  You do not hear it come through.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's just part of the format, I guess.  No, it's weird.  The artists obviously got to be pissed off about that.  All the hip-hop artists that have that word in their songs.  They don't want it.  They seem to like it.  They put it in their song.  They don't want it censored out when it's being played on hip-hop stations.  Not really.  Even when some of the stations have their artists in and they're interviewing them and they're about to say that, 
[02:55:00]  they tell them they cannot allow them to say that over the radio.  So, I guess they understand now.  This country's ridiculous.  Lee's getting close.  Ridiculous.  All right.  Thank you.  We've got to go back to Flea.  Flea.  I'm trying to see if I can finish it, but I think I'm going to puke in like two minutes.  Really?  Is that bad?  It's a quart of milk.  It's a quart of milk.  Yeah, but I've been drinking it too fast.  And you're doing this for the eggnog competition?  Well, that's a lot easier because that's a lot less. 
[02:55:30]  You did drink it pretty quickly.  He did say that.  I mean, he's a kid's challenging.  This kid's got a svelte young body.  I think that he'd be a fine addition.  And he's very popular.  Doug out Doug at fullblown8s.com.  I like the site.  I just don't like Doug.  All right.  We heard you.  We get it.  You're not rivals.  Doug's a man's man.  Let's say hi to Nigel in Kentucky.  Nigel.  I understand the humor behind it, but Uncle Paul makes me physically cringe in my seat.  Dear God, Jimmy.  Why?  You are a creepy man. 
[02:56:00]  It's not Jimmy.  There's another person in the studio.  His name's Uncle Paul.  I'm sorry.  Uncle Paul is a creepy man.  You know what, sir?  You're being very hurtful.  And back when I was your age, we spoke to all the gentlemen with a certain amount of respect and reverence.  And you can't judge a book by its cover.  Got it.  Take the clothes off so you can see the undershorts.  Yeah, you got to take...  I like to...  Sometimes they wear little superheroes on their underpants. 
[02:56:30]  Look at that.  Look at that.  It's nice.  Uncle Paul, we need to know a little more about you.  What do you do for a living?  Do you have a job?  I'm on disability.  You're on disability?  I worked in a warehouse.  Yeah?  And I had an accident.  What happened, of course?  I was struck by one of the other workers.  It was a misunderstanding.  Ah, misunderstanding, yeah.  They're on family day.  I simply took...  His son had to use the bathroom.  I knew where there was a tree and some bushes where nobody would bother him. 
[02:57:00]  So I took him back there and helped him.  You were just helping.  Just helping him out a little bit.  Just helping him.  Uh-oh.  Sweet boy.  All right, let's go back to Flay.  Flay, what's going on over there?  Attaboy.  He finished...  Done.  His quart.  All right, well, we got another one for you.  Yeah, fortunately we have a quart of buttermilk for him.  Oh, wow.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:57:30]  No?  Take a couple sips.  Don't be a girl.  Yeah, you really are a girl.  Wow, that really came up quick, huh?  Oh, God.  Ah.  It's coming out of his nose.  It's not for YouTube.  Oh, God.  It's coming out of his nose.  Yeah.  All right, keep drinking.  I think he just took a real load.  We're not impressed.  Keep drinking.  Keep drinking the milk.  Buttermilk.  Keep drinking the milk.  Get somebody...  Because Stan's busy, get somebody in here to mic him, because Stan's got ten things he's 
[02:58:00]  got to do.  Yeah, someone should just have a mic on him.  He's not a terribly good puker, I've got to be honest.  What person?  You're a stealth puker.  Yeah, you're kind of very quiet.  Yeah, a lot came out, but we didn't get the nice...  No.  Love that sound.  That's all you get is, like...  Keep drinking.  Drink some buttermilk.  You're not impressing us.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Colin in Florida.  He's a social worker. 
[02:58:30]  Colin.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  I just wanted to say to Uncle Paul in studio, I deal with molested kids all the time, and  you're hitting a little too close to home.  Yeah?  Are we?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  I just think, Uncle Paul, that you've done this once or twice and might have actual experience.  Hold on, sir.  We've got something distracting.  That was better. 
[02:59:00]  Hold on, sir.  He's powerbooting over there.  Over a quart of milk, man.  I keep drinking, wow.  Yeah, but what do you tell the kids?  Do you talk to them?  Do I drug them?  No, no, you talk to them.  You don't have to drug them.  Sometimes you buy somebody toys.  You buy them a little something.  Do you get to talk to these kids?  Make them tell you stories?  Yeah, I basically hear stories about when they come back from you.  What do they tell you? 
[02:59:30]  They like it, right?  You like it.  Uh, not so much.  Do you ever tickle a little cunny?  Do you ever give a little cunny a tickle?  A little tickle bucket?  No, no, not really.  You lick your fingers.  You ever have them over and you play a game?  Who could do the most headstands in the skirt?  Oh, look, a headstand.  A game.  Yeah.  No, all mine are younger.  How about the old ticklish bug? 
[03:00:00]  What's that?  Tickle, tickle.  You give them a little tickle.  Yeah.  And when they start to laugh and everything in the shirt comes up, you give them Skittles.  Skittles or Skittles?  Skittles.  Skittles.  They love to play the old game.  Find the M&Ms in Uncle Paul's shorts.  What kind of shorts you wear?  I tend to wear, uh, I like the, uh, the white ones, the Fruit of Looms. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  I know you wear a lot of sweatpants, I know.  Yeah, nice under shorts.  Shows your package off.  Consumming your knee.  Let's go to, uh, Eric in Bethlehem.  Hey, uh, how's Jesus?  Uncle Paul.  Huh?  What?  I was wondering if Uncle Paul could read some nursery rhymes.  Punch it out.  Nursery rhymes with Uncle Paul.  Oh, I don't know. 
[03:01:00]  Are you writing for the show now?  Yeah, he's a writer.  All right, violent video games.  Here we go.  What parents think their kids are doing and what their kids are actually doing relative  to video games are often two different pictures.  While 73% of parents say they always decide which games their children play,  only 30% of children agree.  Critics of these games say their interactive and graphic nature can confuse children,  perhaps even causing violent thoughts and impulses.  Come on.  Wait, where, where's that study coming from? 
[03:01:30]  Come on, will you stop?  Stop already.  Nothing can just be for fun anymore.  The video game industry disputes that, but agrees parents need to be involved.  I don't think you're a bad parent if you choose to allow your 12 or 13-year-old to play an M-rated game,  so long as you know what you're doing.  But the report advises parents to follow the game ratings,  use parental controls on the new game systems,  and set limits on their kids' gaming. 
[03:02:00]  Many parents, perhaps thinking nostalgically to video games of old,  may not be aware of the difference between this death  and this one.  They actually use a Pac-Man sound there?  Yeah.  The freaking news is out of touch.  How you feeling?  Cold.  Cold?  Yeah.  Why cold?  I don't know.  Is this shit even drinkable? 
[03:02:30]  What is it?  It's buttermilk.  It's buttermilk.  Are you drinking it?  Yeah.  I'm halfway done.  You're halfway done?  What does it taste like?  Just thick, viscous, sweet milk?  Yeah, it tastes like a thermos full of spoiled milk.  It's like sucking the phlegm out of somebody's nose or throat.  You ever suck somebody's clogged throat phlegm?  When they do that, that's what you're sucking.  After your vocal cords.  Just cold.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  People are doing nothing but bashing phlegm nonstop.  Why?  Name some people.  They hate him.  Why do they hate him?  Nah, I won't rat anyone out.  Why not?  What are they writing?  Telling him he's not famous.  Shut up.  Is O-Ban 2 on?  No.  What are you, a director now, too?  O-Ban 2 has been broken for three fucking weeks.  Yeah.  Has anybody...  Can everyone get the message?  We're a one-camera shoot here today.  All right.  Well, we got nursery rhymes coming in. 
[03:03:30]  Jesus.  I don't know if Uncle Paul is feeling that today.  We'll see.  Wah, wah.  I'm Flea.  Wah.  You can't even puke right.  Flea sucks.  Whoa.  Yeah, they just really don't like you.  Eh, say it to my face.  Flea is a homo.  Flea isn't funny.  I hate him.  Why don't they like you, Flea?  You're not a bad guy.  Flea sucks Jimmy's cock.  Attaboy. 
[03:04:00]  He's a great guy.  He's an unfunny little insect.  He's annoying.  Yeah.  You really are hated.  Yeah, they want to ban you.  I used to see a banned Flea thing.  Have you ever been banned?  Uh, yeah.  From a guy who just posts salt and vinegar chips.  What?  I don't want him to say the site name.  Why give him a plug?  What do you mean he posts salt and vinegar chips?  Everybody will know what it is.  You have to be a message boarder to get it.  That's his name?  Well, I look at the message boarder.  That's his name? 
[03:04:30]  No.  It's not his name on there.  I don't want to give him a plug.  Okay, don't give him a plug, but why'd he ban you?  Um, I used to plug my radio show.  Like, consistently.  Being a post-whore.  Yeah.  How's the buttermilk coming?  Sucks.  Keep drinking.  When are you going to puke again?  Yeah.  It is spoiled, by the way.  Buttermilk has to be spoiled for it to be effective.  Right.  Yeah, it's been a little...  Well, we had it on the heater for about an hour. 
[03:05:00]  Didn't let it cool back down.  Spoiled buttermilk.  Is it working on you?  Kinda.  Yeah, you're feeling a little queasy.  Why are you shaking?  I'm freezing.  I don't know why.  God, I hope you have some kind of reaction.  Come on, drinking milk?  I don't know.  Who knows?  No, he's just cold.  From what?  He puked it all up.  Maybe that's why.  The milk's probably cold.  Is that cold milk?  I just had a smoothie and it made me a little chilly.  Sometimes I drink something cold and it makes me cold, too. 
[03:05:30]  You know what I want to do?  I want to take Karen Meyer's useless ears and put a little piece of metal in between the  two, cover it with material, and use them as little earmuffs from my own ears.  That's his teeth.  They get chilly.  His teeth are chattering.  Is that your teeth?  Yeah.  Ew.  Listen, listen.  Your teeth are chattering?  Listen.  Are you nervous? 
[03:06:00]  Combo of a lot of things.  Drugs?  You're gay, cold, I'm nervous.  No, I don't do drugs.  Get out of order.  No.  Are we hungover?  We're going to take a break.  Don't puke during the break or we're kicking you out.  Oh, boy.  That's what we do.  That's discipline.  There are many ways to get an Opie and Anthony Wow sticker.  This is not one of them.  Hello.  I am selling Wow stickers on Craigslist.  Please buy a $4,000 American through a numbered account in Zurich and I'll happily send you  a Wow sticker, shiny and new.

[03:07:00]  Oh, man.  What has he drank so far?  A quart of milk and he's working on the quart of buttermilk.  Buttermilk.  Now, a couple of more quarts have been brought in and just to show how much everybody can't  standfully, even the staff here at the show, they didn't bring milk.  What is over there?  Half and half.  Oh, my God.  That is never just drank by anybody.  That is always put in coffee or something like that.  So, he's going to drink that. 
[03:07:30]  And heavy cream.  Just a quart of heavy cream.  He is going to...  Dude, you're going to shit butter sticks.  Perfectly square butter sticks will come out of your asshole.  You still cold?  You look really disoriented.  Yeah, you all right?  I'm doing good.  Getting drunk off of that shit?  Uh, Craig.  Catching a buzz?  No, that wasn't him.  Wasn't Craig's fault.  He's just a sweet boy. 
[03:08:00]  All right.  Dummy, but a sweet boy.  Wireless mic needs to be on.  Who is in charge of that?  What head rolls?  Ah, I like it.  Oh, let's find out right away.  Dead silence.  It's not Sam.  Dead silence.  He used to have been too busy modeling.  All right.  What's going on over there?  Uh, just working on the butter...  What fucking mic am I here?  Just talking to one...  Even Flea is annoyed.  Talking to one in front of your face.  Way to go, Thane.  Good answer.  Working on the buttermilk.  I'm about halfway done.  It's just disgusting.  Well, start chugging, will you?  Yeah, chug a lug, as we used to say when I was partying. 
[03:08:30]  Chug a lug.  You're supposed to be impressing us so we get you in the eggnog drinking contest.  We're not impressed yet.  That's right.  Chug.  Chug a lug.  Look at this chattering.  Yeah.  Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter.  A little chattering teeth.  I want to put your teeth on a table and watch them make everyone laugh.  Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.  Why is the blind guy taking pictures?  Why?  He's photographing his own face by accident.  A hundred pictures of his eye. 
[03:09:00]  He's got the picture.  He's got it lined up.  But, of course, he's aiming the wrong way.  And he has a photo of the bottom of his nose and his gum line.  What is this?  Is this the who at the concert I went to?  No.  It's your staring in the wrong direction eye and half of your ear.  Oh, here's a good one of your forehead and hairline.  All right.  Now we've got to get blind guy in here with the big-titted monster.  Well, he has to get a girl with big tits.  He can't see anything below D's.  His eyes won't register anything below D's.  She's a redhead, too, which is kind of sexy.  Do you have red puig hair? 
[03:09:30]  Do you shave it?  Ugh.  Nice.  Shaved.  She won't fuck him, though.  All right.  Come on in here.  I was thinking about me.  Bring the big-titted monster and blind guy into the studio.  Wow.  He's flipping you the bird.  I like that.  Why are you flipping me the bird?  You called her a monster.  You just called her a monster.  Big-titted monster.  It's hard to get a chicken.  I'm a fat chick.  You do have some huge tits, though.  I got to say.  Wow.  Thank you.  Do you shave?  I shave, yeah.  How much?  Everything.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You got to take care of it, don't you?  You're not a fat chick?  I am a fat chick.  No, I totally admit that. 
[03:10:00]  But you just said you're not a fat chick.  No, I said I'm not a monster, but I'm a fat chick.  Oh, okay.  But she's got huge tits.  I didn't understand that.  I'm sorry.  So that kind of...  Balances it out a little bit?  Yeah, it balances it out.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because you don't want to be a flatso.  No.  Oh, God, no.  When did you start developing?  Oh, fuck.  Tits?  Yeah.  Yeah, like around four years old.  In the womb, the ultrasound.  Here are her tits.  The girl.  I can see that girl.  My mom's fat.  She's a fat chick, too.  I was like eight years old.  Eight, and you started getting tits? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  I was like fucking triple D by the time I was saying three.  Uncle Paul liked that.  Hold on, hold on.  Please.  What's up, Flea?  Silence, everyone.  Please tell me you're almost done with the buttermilk.  Oh, boy.  You all right?  See, the guests in the studio don't know to shut the fuck up when someone pukes.  Sorry.  That's okay.  You're blind.  Shut up.  Yeah.  How's he supposed to know something was going on?  Jesus.  Shut up. 
[03:11:00]  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good boy.  What table matters this kid has?  Vomit on your upper lip.  He's churning.  Vomit on your upper lip.  Still not impressed, though.  What color are your nips?  Pink.  They're very big.  Why don't you show them?  They're big?  No, they're tiny actually.  Can you let blind guy feel you up?  Don't squeak your tits. 
[03:11:30]  He doesn't get any action.  No, I mean, like, I've flashed him before.  You're wearing a bra?  Wait, wait, hold on.  Yeah, I'm wearing a bra.  I'm wearing a bra.  I'm wearing a bra.  I'm wearing a bra.  I'm wearing a bra.  I'm wearing a bra.  I'm wearing a bra.  I'm wearing a bra.  I could use some breast milk.  Does anybody remember last night?  It's coming out, Colonel.  Oh, it stinks over there?  It's starting to really stink.  You'll smell it in about 30 seconds.  No, if I smell it, I'll probably puke. 
[03:12:00]  I'll probably need some of the Febreze over here.  Are you done with the buttermilk?  Buttermilk and bile.  That's nice.  Here it comes.  Some nice fucking bile.  Start spraying.  Start spraying the can.  Yeah, roll it over.  Spray the can.  Thanks.  I'd say if he could drink the quart of half-and-half, he's in the contest.  Putting up a barrier.  That'll be fair, right?  That's right.  He's got 50 minutes to drink a quart of half-and-half.  And some throat yogurt. 
[03:12:30]  Half-and-half, heavy cream.  So, blind guy.  Heavy cream's worse than half-and-half.  Name's Bob.  Bob.  Sorry.  No, blind guy.  That's okay.  Half-blind guy.  That's right.  What do you think your chances are of feeling those things?  Already done it.  What?  Already done it.  Oh, you already felt it?  Already done it.  When?  A while ago.  Your titty fucked her?  I'm like, what if I know?  While you were sleeping.  Oh, while you were sleeping?  No, no.  It's last time.  So, is Krista a whore or what?  Krista's a goer.  She, like, fucking hit on me one day.  We were just hanging out.  She's like, you've got such a sexy voice. 
[03:13:00]  I would totally fuck you.  I'm like, wow.  She hasn't been with too many people, but she just hits on people openly.  Yeah.  Like, she has no filter at all.  Is she hot?  Or a cornea.  She's looking enough.  She's hot and horny.  She's hot for a blind check.  What does that mean?  She's not that hot, but, like, compared to some other chicks that I know who are blind,  she's pretty banging.  Yeah.  I really don't know what that means.  Well, I like to fuck.  I don't know either.  Blind chicks are great.  They can't identify you.  They can't pick you out of a lineup.  Like, there's just that, like, especially, like, albino chicks, they just don't look as 
[03:13:30]  hot.  So, you know, when you get, like, a good-looking blind chick, it's just surprising.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't think we're going to get much more out of you.  Why do you have small nipples?  You ain't going to pull those out, huh?  I can just show them.  I can just.  Yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  It's Wednesday.  I like that.  Yeah.  Don't ruin it.  No, seriously.  Don't reen it.  All right.  Get real close, blind guys, so you can see these things.  My eyesight's not that bad, man.  You can see.  It's not that bad.  You can see those from a mile away. 
[03:14:00]  Nice.  Just don't get my face in any of the pictures.  No, no problem.  Okay.  I'm going to blur that right out.  Here we go.  And.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  They are giant.  You're a busty girl.  Those are some huge tits.  You're a busty girl.  Thank you.  Thank you.  A bucksotic.  I justify you not to look.  My mom breastfed me, so.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She overfed you.  Yeah, I'm still overfeeding myself.  That's a problem.  Is that it?  You like to eat?  No, actually.  You're not lying? 
[03:14:30]  Are you one of these bullshit thyroid people?  No, no, not at all.  I know people who are like that.  It's more like I'm just too fucking lazy to cook, so I go to like McDonald's all the time.  Ah, that'll do it.  Yeah, exactly.  You take big dumps?  No, actually.  I'm having a problem with my shits right now.  Oh, like Jimmy?  Yeah, I really like.  What'd you go and chop them off?  They're just tiny little shits, and they crackle, and it's just not like a good stuff.  What is that?  Who'd pay for that?  Yeah.  You gotta fucking start taking some.  I got some oxy powder here.  I'm gonna take you.  This stuff will make you shit in a few days.  Good times.  You'll be right as rain.  Good times. 
[03:15:00]  Go to my doctor and be like, give us some back.  Right as rain.  Hey, do you have big, not to be personal, but do you have big lips?  Yeah.  Well, they're like, they're moderate.  They're not like Britney Spears Sharpay pussy lips, but they look decent.  Anything hanging out of there?  Dear God, no.  Like a steak-em sandwich?  Oh, fuck no.  No, I've got like a nice situation.  Mine is nice.  It's all sealed up?  Yeah, it's all nice and like covered up, and it's not like fucking beefsteak down there.  Yeah, I like a pussy that looks like a fucking, a thing that's hatching and fucking invasion of the body snatchers. 
[03:15:30]  I want a fucking, a pod cunt.  A fucking hatching pod cunt.  I feel like, personally, when I want a girl sitting on my face, I don't want her to have like a roast beef mayo vag happening.  That's not attractive.  That's where we part company.  I want a fucking girl.  I want it to look like aliens.  Like her cunt just grabbed my fucking, my helmet.  No, I'm not cool with that kind of scary vag.  More girls than guys? 
[03:16:00]  At the moment, yes.  It really depends.  Interesting.  She just got her heart broken.  What happened?  I got, I got my heart broken by a girl at my school.  No, she was just a cunt.  She was like, oh yeah, I don't have a boyfriend.  Let's get together.  And then, you know, she's like, oops, I have a boyfriend.  Did you eat her ass?  No, we never hooked up.  You an ass eater?  I would not eat anybody's ass.  What a rookie.  I'm sorry.  What's wrong with you?  I just lost my virginity in May.  You did?  How old are you? 
[03:16:30]  You what, a guy?  I'm 19.  Okay, that's fair, fair.  You just lost it in May?  Yeah.  Oh, how'd that happen?  Um, like, it's a really long story.  Ah, just, just a highlight.  Me and my friend decided to have a threesome with him.  She like freaked out because her mom walked in on us.  And then we went back to his dorm room and I was just like, hey, why don't you fuck me?  And he fucked me.  Cool, at least you're smooth about it.  Yeah.  Just throw him a bone right there.  I really wanted to be sentimental about it.  So I was like, yeah, it's, you know, it's just hanging in your dorm room.  Well, you and your friend were fucking a guy and the mother walked in and what did she say? 
[03:17:00]  What are you and your father doing with that redheaded girl?  She was like, what is this redneck doing in my fucking house?  No, um, you know, we just like went back to his dorm room and, uh.  Did you tell him it was your first time?  Oh, yeah.  I was like, yeah, I'm a virgin.  Just take it easy.  And then, like, at the end, he fucking ruined it.  What happened?  He ended up, like, we were talking about Guns N' Roses that night and he was like, oh,  I've got their CD.  Let's listen to it.  So he puts on Appetite for Destruction and this fucking dumbass redneck hick motherfucker 
[03:17:30]  looks at me after he comes and he starts singing Paradise City.  I was like, what the fuck is wrong with you?  That's now your fuck song forever and ever.  No, every time I hear it.  Forever and ever.  That will be your fuck song now.  Every time I've heard it, I'm just like, oh, I can't listen to this.  So he dumps his fucking load and starts singing.  At least he didn't eat your pussy and sing Welcome to the Jungle.  No, no.  There we go. 
[03:18:00]  She's a virgin.  After they fucked this, she's like a twister board.  No, he was small, so it was easy entry.  Oh, no.  Really?  Redding from Whackbag, this girl's lesbian stories are hot.  Are not hot.  She's probably getting her box eaten by a girl with a Pete Rose haircut.  Actually, no.  For some reason, hot chicks really dig me.  Like, I've banged some pretty hot chicks, so I'm cool.  You sure you're not blind, too?  No, I'm close to it, but no.  She is.  Hold on a second. 
[03:18:30]  I'll give you my friend's MySpace.  Why are we listening to that music?  Yeah, well, because Bill thought he would add to the show.  That was terrific.  Bill, it was actually a very good ad for the first eight minutes of the song.  Right.  Hey, holy fuckaroni.  Find Doug Stanhope's MySpace Bulletin on Comic Relief.  Just posted.  Probably Doug trash everybody.  Go get that.  Get Doug to read it.  I'm ready to get Doug fucking read it.  Yeah, can we get Doug on the phone because we're all about the Comic Relief lately.  He'd fuck you up the ass? 
[03:19:00]  Uh, no.  God, no.  Did he try?  No, he never tried.  Got a little dick?  Yeah, he's got a little dick, but I wouldn't let him know my ass.  Let him fuck your ass.  I don't know.  How about this?  I'm serious to me.  Since you were just a virgin, would you lay on the bed and let him fuck your mouth while  he fingered your shitter?  I'm not trying to ask an inappropriate question.  I'm totally cool with blowing him.  I love giving head.  Oh, yeah?  I'm a fat chick.  Of course I love sucking cotton.  I'm a good girl.  Wow, that was perfect.  Please, can we isolate that?  Oh, shit, I was talking.  That's all right.  Yeah, can you say it again? 
[03:19:30]  Oh, um.  I'm a fat chick.  I love sucking cock.  No, I'm a fat chick.  Of course I love sucking cock.  Of course it adds to it.  Yeah, we're trying to get...  I'm a fat chick.  Of course I'm a fat chick.  Hold on.  I'm going to start talking again.  Yeah, that'll be with talking.  I'm going to give you a little direction.  We're going to throw this into a promo.  Why are you shaking like a leaf now?  I don't know.  Are you getting the half and half down?  Yeah, I'm about halfway done.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's kind of like a half and half and half and half and half and half.  Oh, by the way, then you've got to finish it off with milk, and then we'll  watch you in the eggnog chicken contest.  And then we're going to give you a booty, a little fucking... 
[03:20:00]  All right.  We're going to use this in a promo, so say it right.  I'm a fat chick.  Of course I love sucking cock.  Not bad.  Not perfect.  All right.  We'll use that somewhere.  But you should...  Did he let him titty fuck you?  Can you say it like you were...  I'm sorry.  I once let him titty fuck me.  Once.  Once?  Yeah.  I don't like that too much.  That's not from Bob.  That's a girl.  Did he shoot bisquick all over your neck and then fucking play another GNR song?  No.  Once he tried to come in my mouth, though, and I ended up running to the bathroom and  like spitting it out.  Aw.  I'm such a fucking priss, man.  You really are.  I know.  You should have shot on some carrot cake you would have enjoyed. 
[03:20:30]  I do like carrot cake.  What was the problem there?  You just couldn't bring yourself to it.  Yeah.  It was like the worst thing.  You found the one thing.  You don't like the taste of it.  That and Brussels sprouts.  Maybe if it was called Mick Cum, you'd have...  Yeah, tell me.  If he had like a cheeseburger or something.  What part of the chicken does this come from?  Was that super-sized?  Yes.  She's a cool chick.  She's...  Yeah, I like her. 
[03:21:00]  Nice, honest.  Thank you.  Flea?  You got to get with the little dirty, a little bit more dirty.  Oh, I'm dirty, but I just haven't done anything yet.  Oh, boy.  That don't look good.  He's trying to swallow...  He's drinking half and half.  Stop chewing it, Flea.  I'm kind of impressed.  I got to be honest.  I know.  Half and half is pretty rough.  We're putting him really through a lot of shit here.  I think Flea's going to be good.  He's a good boy.  He is a good boy.  I don't know why the message boards all think he's fucking just a pile of cunt.  Because he's an asshole.  But...  You're shaking.  I know.  Look at his hand.  I know. 
[03:21:30]  Fucking microwave Fox.  I don't know.  I'm just cold.  You're all right.  The loons.  Are you getting close to puking again?  Actually, no.  This isn't...  We have a rectal thermometer.  This is easier than buttermilk.  The buttermilk was just thick.  We certainly do.  What's up, Uncle Paul?  I asked for a rectal thermometer.  I'd be happy to provide one.  It's the same as a mouth thermometer.  He's got to take his temperature.  But he can't be mouthed because he's been drinking so much milk.  The temperature in his mouth is probably low.  It's probably very cold.  Yeah, you'd need a rectal thermometer. 
[03:22:00]  In the buttocks.  You put it in his little backside.  You put a little snaps down on the back of the PJs.  Oh, God damn.  Put it in his backside.  It's a little feety PJs.  Keep the feet nice and warm.  That's the sound they make on the floor.  Paul, I forgot.  Were you married?  I forgot.  Yeah, my wife...  My wife was injured in a fire.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  I forgot.  And he took care of her for a while.  Seven years, was it? 
[03:22:30]  Seven years, he took care of her.  Yeah.  He made love all through it.  Right.  And she looked real surprised during the whole thing.  We're making love a day and a half after the accident in the hospital.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John.  Hey, hey, Jen.  Hey.  When a fat chick who's a virgin tells you you have a little dick,  you have reached the bottom of rock bottom.  A lot of people saying that she sounds hot. 
[03:23:00]  She is sexy.  Hey, Jimmy.  What up, buddy?  Hey, Jimmy.  I can't believe I said what up, buddy.  Yes, sir.  Oh, you did have me.  That's why I hesitate.  I said what up.  He kind of got me.  He did get me, actually, even though I knew it.  Sergeant Magoo is on Pal Talk right now.  Yeah.  He's been drinking milk.  Yeah.  Like crazy.  Gallons of milk.  Now he has a stick of butter that he just put ketchup on.  And he's taking a huge, he's going to take a huge bite of a full big stick of butter  with ketchup poured all over it.  Ugh.  That is fucking disgusting. 
[03:23:30]  That is, ah.  You know what would be even worse?  He just did it.  Swallow it.  I want to see him take a stick of butter and suck it like it's a cock.  Not to be gay either, believe me.  Not a gay thing.  He is chewing this and, and he ate it.  Wait, what did Flea say?  Sergeant Magoo said for the eggnog contest, if he were to be part of it, he would take  a taser shot after every shot of eggnog.  We don't want to kill him.  Jesus Christ.  He's a Marine.  He can take.  No, it would be fun.  Oh, okay.  So he knows how to eat bugs and shit. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Brendan from New York.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey, this girl says she lost her virginity back in May.  Has anybody asked Flea when he lost his virginity?  Flea?  Still a virgin?  Comment?  Hmm?  Who called?  Are you still a virgin?  It depends who's asking.  No, yes or no.  What do you mean?  If it's your uncle, no.  If it's anyone else, yes?  I'm on the radio, so I'll say yes.  It's smooth.  This kid speaks in code.  Everywhere it's yes.  Now, I was at a show at Vaughn. 
[03:24:30]  Boy, let's get the CIA so we can figure this out.  All right, so you never thought you were going to saw it.  Why is everything so cryptic with you?  Yeah, just answer.  How come you can't just give us a straight fucking answer to anything?  I don't want to give a plug.  I don't know.  I want to give a plug.  Don't do this.  What's wrong with him?  He's an ass.  Yes, you're a virgin.  Wait, baby, if we're on the radio, yes.  How about an answer?  It's not the Iran-Contra hearing, you dope.  You're drinking half and half.  That girl right there lost her virginity in the spring.  That's right, to a black gentleman.  And you?  Oh, I wish.  You wish?  I wish, yeah.  You want a black queen?  You want a black cock?  No, I'm actually not. 
[03:25:00]  I was with a guy who was like eight inches, and it was very, very painful.  But at least a black guy would have had some talent and suaveness.  Wait, if you're a virgin...  Oh, wow, since May, you've been just going crazy, right?  You can't get enough cock.  No, not really.  Not really.  Can't get enough cock.  I've only had two partners.  Oh, okay.  One little dick and eight-incher?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  You should fucking find some middle ground there.  Eight-incher was like my second time ever, and I was like, oh, this really sucks.  Was he fat, too?  No, it was just long.  He's a skinny... 
[03:25:30]  She went from, like, single-A ball to the majors.  He got called up quick.  All the way May would be proud.  Oh, wait a minute.  Why am I doing this?  All the way May.  No, no, no.  That's your great ad.  Come on.  All the way May would be ashamed.  All right, I got caught up in it.  Stop.  All the way May would have said you should have started with the eight-incher and in your ass.  All the way May started with one in her mouth, ass, and cunts.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[03:26:00]  Hey, now you've gone too far.  So you want a black guy?  Why do you think that'll be more suave than a white cock?  No, it's just, like, compared to who I was with for the first time, I would have rather  been with a black guy, but I'm not, like, I'm really, oh, jeez.  What, did he steal your car?  I'm not one of those fat chicks who really likes dating black guys.  I've dated black guys in the past, and he was pretty cool.  Yeah, well, you kind of, you're built for a black guy.  I am.  Black guy's probably looking at you all the time, going, ooh, yeah, I like that shit. 
[03:26:30]  I've got a lot of comments.  Like, I was walking in a, like, friggin' parking lot one day, and some black guy just stops and,  like, stares at my ass, and he's like, damn, girl, why are those jeans so baggy?  I'm like, what the fuck?  Damn, girl.  So, how do you feel being half-blind guy, and you haven't fucked her, yet she's ready  to just shove black cock in her?  I'm cool with it.  Yeah?  We're good like that.  You're a big, hot-fucking half-blind guy, fuck you.  Come on.  I've had a lot of people tell me that.  You don't seem to put much...  He's not a bad-looking guy.  Yeah, let blind guy nourish. 
[03:27:00]  No, yeah, I think he's like a frail Tom Hanks.  In Philadelphia.  It doesn't seem like you put much importance into fucking...  No, you know, a little bit.  So, you could throw him one.  Can't someone feel you up or something?  I'm feel your tits.  He's a good guy.  He's a fucking half-blind guy.  He's your friend.  I love him.  He's like...  But that's the thing.  He's like a brother to me.  No, no, no, no.  I'm dating a girl who was one of my best friends for three years, and I mean nothing ever happened.  Nothing.  Like a brother.  Now, we're dating.  The thing is like... 
[03:27:30]  Give him a squishy toy.  He won't know the difference.  He doesn't make believe you're doing it.  I can see the sign behind it.  I've told him, I'm like, hey, let me buy you a hooker for Christmas.  He's like, no, no.  Because he likes you.  Well, you love giving head.  How about you just suck his dick?  Have you seen his cock?  No, but my best friend has.  Oh, really?  She said it was okay.  How did your best friend see it?  She asked to see it.  Oh.  Yeah.  We were in the car on the way back to my house, and she's like, I want to see it.  So, I was like, all right.  She was horrified.  We got back to my house.  I pulled it out, and her friend kind of grabbed a hold of it, gave it a little, how do you do, 
[03:28:00]  and said, nice.  Much cool.  Do you want to see it, Jim?  I don't want to see it, but how about this?  How about you show her while none of us are looking?  We won't look.  You've got nothing going on right now.  So what?  You're not supposed to when it's fucking a room full of guys and one of them is puking.  If your dick was hard, there'd be something wrong with you.  It should be.  I have a nice dick.  Some would say delicious.  And others would say responsible and, you know.  No, no.  Work it a little.  Why don't you just look at his penis?  You don't have to touch it. 
[03:28:30]  It's looking at a dick.  Yeah, let's go.  My mother has seen my cock.  Okay, you're fine.  All right, fine.  All right, let's get this done.  Do I, like, can I just, you know.  No, you.  We're just going to mic you as he shows you.  We're not looking.  We're not looking.  You stand against that wall.  I don't want anybody else to see it.  You don't want you to look.  We're not fucking homos.  There's something really fucked up about seeing my best friend's penis.  Don't worry about it.  Look at him.  This kid can't get it that fast enough.  He wants to pull that cock out.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I really want to get, like, some razor blades.  Oh, come on.  No. 
[03:29:00]  Don't worry about it.  It's just like him.  It's one-eyed.  It's a dick.  All right, here we go.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  Can you look?  Yeah, I see it.  I see it.  Look at it more.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Look at it.  I don't want to look at it more.  Look at it.  I saw it.  Look at that cock.  I do not want your feet to my arms.  Look at the cock.  Just look at the cock.  Look at the cock.  Make a good look.  I am looking at his cock.  But you look away.  You keep looking away.  Look at the cock.  Look at the cock.  You've got to look at it for a while. 
[03:29:30]  Look at it.  Look at it.  What am I going to get if I look at the cock?  Describe it at the cock.  Look at it.  Look at the cock.  I'm looking at it.  All right, you're looking at the cock.  Yeah.  Now, as you're looking.  Describe it for everybody.  Describe it.  But you've got to look and describe at the same time.  It's protruding from the open zipper of his jeans.  It's very tiny.  Oh, Jesus.  He's cut and hairy.  Is that enough?  Very tiny?  Yeah.  Smaller than your original?  Yeah.  And is it because he's nervous? 
[03:30:00]  It's because he's soft.  So, you know.  Yeah, but you could be soft and still have some real estate down there.  What are you thinking?  You're thinking that thing wouldn't be a shower even if it was grown?  No, I think that it would definitely be a shower.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I like her.  Why don't you flick it for him?  No.  Just give it a little flick.  No.  But not a hard one.  No.  Like, look, I'm putting my finger out like I'm pointing, and then you touch the helmet,  and you can actually say, go, he-le-le-le-le-le-le.  Please do that for me.  He-le-le-le-le-le. 
[03:30:30]  That makes it silly.  Yeah, it makes it silly.  That has nothing to do with-  I got a couple hundred bucks, you know?  You know what?  Just tap it like a sticky gauge.  I'm not touching it.  Oh, God.  We want a he-dly-he-dly-he-dly.  I'm not making yodeling noises.  That's not a yodel.  Yodel.  Yes, give it a glove.  Where are the surgical gloves?  Wait, who's bigger than me, Brian?  You're bigger than Brian.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Brian's the first guy to fuck.  The small cock, dude.  The small cock, dude.  Oh, okay.  Oh, I thought you said-  Watch this.  Watch, like, a certain friend of ours is going to sue us for saying that Brian's cock is small. 
[03:31:00]  Nah, fuck him.  You don't yodel.  Everyone knows it.  You don't yodel.  You hold the balls.  When you're holding balls, you go-  Where are the gloves?  When you're tickling the cock, it's he-le-le-le-le-le.  He-le-le-le-le-le.  He-le-le-le-le-le-le-le.  That's all.  That's cock tickle noise.  I have an issue.  I'm not going to make that noise.  It's called the cock tickle.  All right.  Flick his cock?  I've flicked cocks before.  Do you need surgical gloves on, though?  Yes.  You want the gloves?  No, I don't need-  He's clean.  Real ego.  Oh, okay.  I'm sure he's clean. 
[03:31:30]  All right.  Let's hear it.  All right.  Give a little heat-le-le-le-le-le-le.  Should one guy pull his pants all the way down?  You have to, dude.  No, no, no.  You can get at it this way.  Yeah, but this way your bag is in view.  That's right.  I really-  Yeah, show your bag, Terry.  Get all that home.  Just don't be-  We're not looking, dude.  Your fan is the most home-  Pull-  Then you guys are going to see my ass.  We don't care.  Oh, no.  Just pull the whole thing through, and how about-  Don't you know what a fucking razor is?  Is he really, like, haired up?  Yeah.  Dude.  Here's what you got to do.  I'm going to get you some fucking nair for Christmas. 
[03:32:00]  Give a little heed-leed-leed, and then give him a quick three tugs.  I'm not going to say heed-leed-leed.  Three quick tugs.  I'm not quickly tugging.  No, you just grab it and go, go.  And actually make the noise.  Go.  Not, not, not.  Heed-leed-leed.  Not, not, not, not.  Heed-leed-leed.  Not, not, not.  I'm not.  Can I do it over his sweatshirt?  No.  No.  No, it's got to be like just.  Dude, your hair, like, what the fuck, man?  Your cock looks like.  Is he getting any action here from this?  No, I'm in a room full of guys. 
[03:32:30]  What's his cock look like?  It's there.  What's up with the balls?  What about the bag?  They're huge.  They're bulbous.  He's got a huge ball bag.  It's supporting a very soft, tiny penis.  This is not how I envision my first appearance on the fucking show.  Really not.  It's shrinking.  Hold on a minute.  It's gradually shrinking as the time goes on.  It's getting smaller with the prospect that you're going to touch it?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  It's getting smaller with the prospect of everyone talking about my balls. 
[03:33:00]  We can't see it there.  His cock and balls, it looks like a fucking balloon that's tied off.  So, guys, give him a little tickle on the head.  Just a little clicky.  I'm not making any noises.  No, we need the heat.  All right, I flicked it.  Oh, you flicked it.  I flicked it.  Now, does that feel good?  For the .5 seconds that it was.  Yeah, that felt amazing.  My fingernail is completely aroused right now.  Have you had sex, sir?  No comment.  That's no.  Hold on a second.  Now, Flea has to shit. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, get a mic.  Get a mic.  Take a mic in there.  Mic it.  Come on.  Be a man.  Don't give a mic.  You've got to take a fucking half and a half shit.  We want to hear it.  You put your cock back.  You take a mic in when you take a shit.  We want to listen.  This is quality programming.  Hold on.  I've got to tell you.  Scott from Chicago, I love your show.  First time listening to XM today.  Your terrestrial show is better since there is actually a large amount of humor and wit,  and you have to actually try to stay clean with things instead of just running buck wild.  He turned into the wrong show today.  It is. 
[03:34:00]  It goes from...  We are running buck wild today.  It just goes from really trying to stay within the guidelines and describe things to touch  his cock and shit some half and half.  But how great is this?  You can touch a blind guy's cock.  There's rules.  Yeah.  Mr. Torrance from Wackbag.  Co-workers are at my cubicle talking to me while in my earpiece I hear Anthony yelling,  look at the cock.  Look at the cock.  Would you be open to perhaps letting him look down the front of your pants?  You just pull him out and see your shaved pussy. 
[03:34:30]  What good is it going to do him?  I don't know.  He can't even do it.  I can see that sign behind Oak.  He's watching me eat out my best friend.  Can you see how many fingers I'm holding up?  I can see that you're holding your hand up.  I can't see how many fingers.  I can see the windows behind you and the big virus sign behind you.  At one eye completely blind, the other one seems to be going.  This one is just one of the sort of works.  And what happened?  Briefly.  You don't have to go into a house explanation.  I used to please, not enough blood getting to you.  Hold on, Flea.  How?  Not enough blood getting to you out the corner.  Oh, sorry.  I interrupted you, but I thought Flea was going to start doing something. 
[03:35:00]  I have one of those cameras at school.  I know what you can do with it.  Flea.  Make a doody.  No.  Come on.  Dude, Sam.  He's afraid of the camera.  You're not going in the contest.  Wait, what are they doing?  They're trying to film him.  No one wants to see him shitting.  Just get the audio.  Yeah, we just need audio, guys.  Sam in here.  Just audio.  Sam's a shit freak.  And we've got a black guy that wants to have sex with you, so.  All right.  I'm on the line, big-titted monster. 
[03:35:30]  BTM.  We'll call you BTM.  That's fine.  All right.  BTM.  That's O-1-2.  Flea.  Flea.  What are you doing?  I'm in here.  I'm stealing Jimmy's bed, I guess.  All right.  Let's hear.  Is he shitting in a rector set?  Stop locking the door, you homophobe.  Afraid they're going to come in and rape him again while he's shitting. 
[03:36:00]  Like it happened in Juvie.  Juvie.  Juvie.  What the fuck year are you in?  All right.  Here's the mic.  Oh, fuck.  Uh-oh.  Can Flea hear us?  I think Danny can hear you.  Danny.  See, we need somebody to hear us.  Yeah, no one.  No, somebody does have headphones on.  Yeah.  Who's got headphones on in the bathroom? 
[03:36:30]  What's up?  Flea should be.  All right.  Flea.  Flea?  Danny?  Yeah, yeah, what's up?  Oh, Flea, you can hear us?  Are you getting close to shitting?  Yep, pretty close.  All right.  Is the mic close by?  Yep.  All right.  Make sure we get that nice echoey.  Put the mic by your little balls.  Yeah.  Don't shit on it, though.  Tell us when you're ready.  Somebody's in here.  Yeah, so what?  So what?  It's a fucking public bathroom.  Just squeeze one out, for God's sake.  Mr. O from Boston. 
[03:37:00]  This is the best fucking show I've heard in weeks.  The Deedle-deedle-deedle-honk-honk-honk  is the funniest fucking thing I've heard.  I want that as my ringtone.  That would make a good ringtone.  What was the masturbation noise?  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  It was almost like a studio thing.  Damn it.  Flea?  Yep.  We're waiting for you.  I'm waiting for myself.  You can't shit on cue.  You had to shit so bad,  you held up a fucking sign 
[03:37:30]  and ran out of here.  Oh, Jesus.  Jimmy's shitting in here.  You're a spoiler of fun.  Does Flea have headphones on?  I'm going to take this opportunity  to eat some fruit.  Hey, Flea,  why don't you tell us  when you're going to shit?  The most awful fucking thing ever made.  When you have to shit,  tell us I'm going to shit  and put the mic down  by your fucking unviewed balls.  Your unshaved boy balls. 
[03:38:00]  Never seen a girl's balls.  And I promise you,  if you fuck this up,  I'm going in there  and I'm going to spray you.  That's right.  With the urine?  With shit.  So we're going to  hee-le-le-le-le.  Hey, Pete in Philly,  what's up?  Yo, what's up?  I'm trying to get a hold of this.  What?  I'm trying to get a hold  of this shorty on here.  She said she wants  to hug up with her brother, man.  Hey, you live in Philly?  I can't hear her.  She can't hear her.  He wants to know  if you live in Philly.  Hold on,  she's putting headphones on, sir.  Yeah.  All right,  the black dude from Philly 
[03:38:30]  wants to have sex with you.  Really?  Um, why?  Why?  Because you said  you want a black dude.  Because you're a white chick.  No, I said that I would, like,  for my virginity,  I'd bang a black eye,  I should say.  Are you a big boy, sir?  Do you have a big penis?  I'm all right.  How do I?  That means he has a small dick.  Oh.  Yeah, what do you got?  All right, I'm ready.  All right, all right.  Hold on, guys.  Hold on.  Shit. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, fuck.  You fucking bashful asshole you have.  His asshole's like,  I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.  I hate his shy asshole.  His asshole is shy.  He felt it.  He's ready to roll.  Then he puts the mic,  then he puts the mic by it  and it turns into rolling.  I can't, I, I will, I will. 
[03:39:30]  We know you will.  All right.  But at least you called attention to it.  All right, just,  just sit there and wait  and we'll do a show  and interrupt us again  when you feel  you don't have to really shit.  Sir, from Philly.  We have Philly guys  still on the line, right?  I lost him.  Let's go to Nick in Texas.  Nick.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Did you notice that  the broad just said  she ate out her best friend  in front of the blind guy?  Then how come she has trouble  blowing her fucking  the male best friend?  Yeah.  There's a difference. 
[03:40:00]  My other best friend  is actually like a complete slut  and everybody's banged her.  Who?  This girl, Tina.  She, what's she look like?  Oh, she's fucking hot.  She's like five, six,  brown hair, brown eyes.  All right, I don't care about that.  I don't care if her fucking  head is gone.  Oh, I'm like 34B,  but her cunt is disgusting.  Why?  It's what I said before,  a roast beef vag with mayo in it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Does she shave it?  No.  And she's a brunette.  She has a meaty pussy?  Yeah.  It's one of those  that you put a firecracker  in a...  Can I see it? 
[03:40:30]  I don't have a picture  of her pussy.  Will she send me one?  It's interrupted.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  All right, listen,  you're changing the subject.  What's wrong with this schlup?  I don't know.  He's just like,  he's so close to me,  like, you know,  I can't do that.  I'm a bummer.  You know something?  He doesn't care.  He doesn't care how close  and sisterly and brotherly  and he doesn't care.  Oh, no, I know  that he'd bang me.  And you, like,  you seem, you know,  pretty open to experimentation.  Yeah, just not with him.  Wouldn't it be funny  to kind of,  you go out, you know,  and then you fuck 
[03:41:00]  and then you could  kind of goof on him  all night?  Yeah, what's the real...  You could be hanging out.  You could be,  remember how lousy  you were fucking me?  They'd give you  something to talk about.  What's the real problem  with him?  There's nothing wrong  with him.  No, there's nothing  wrong with him.  Watch, you didn't tug  his cock a little bit.  It was a joke.  You should give it  a little tweak.  Not a tweak's that good  enough.  She was supposed to  grab it and give it  the old one, two, three.  And could you let  my friend here  tune in Tokyo  with those big bosoms  of yours?  That'd be a nice present.  Bob?  For a guy.  You want him to...  Yeah, it's not sexual  because you're tuning  in Tokyo here.  Just under the shirt 
[03:41:30]  and just like  give a little...  Over the bra?  No, under the brazeer.  Feeling bare-breast.  Brazeer.  I want my brazeer on.  Feeling bare-breast, though.  Yeah, we gotta keep  this sexy.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is really sexy.  A fat chick  and a blind guy  molesting each other.  Play.  It is.  Play.  Ah, fleas the show stop.  Fall in.  Play.  Literally the show stop.  Shit.  I...  I...  Went. 
[03:42:00]  Why didn't you call us?  Because it's not  all the way done.  Well, then why...  It's half out your ass?  Pretty much.  Why didn't you fucking tell us?  You're shitting  and not letting us know.  Because it's hard  to keep moving the mic  back and forth.  No, it's not.  I do it constantly.  I can do four hours  doing that.  That's right.  Then again,  we're professional broadcasters.  That's true.  It's strange.  I'm yelling at him  because I couldn't hear him shit.  I know.  I know.  I know.  So let's go back  to yelling at me  for not touching  a blind guy's cock.  Yes.  Well, no. 
[03:42:30]  We'll just...  How about he slips  his hands up your shirt  under your bra  and feels those  wonderful,  huge,  fun bags of yours.  I don't feel your tits.  Jesus.  The guy...  Look, he's already  coming over.  She didn't even  give an answer.  He's wandering over.  You know what's great  about the blind?  He knew exactly  where those boobs were.  He certainly did.  Yep.  I can see...  Like a magnet.  You can't see.  I can see the  fucking sign behind you.  Yeah, you keep saying that.  It looks like a fucking  piss stain on asphalt to you.  No, not really. 
[03:43:00]  I can read it.  What's it saying?  Virus.  Well, too bad  that's not what it says.  Thank you.  It says Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  It just does it really...  Yes, it does, sir.  By the way,  Sergeant Magoo  on Pal Talk  has been drinking milk  and eating butter  with ketchup on it  and all kinds  of other crap.  He just vomited  into a bucket  and then drank  the vomit.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  This guy is 
[03:43:30]  a fucking trooper, man.  Is he making videos  so we can check this out later?  I'm sure it's being  capped on Pal Talk.  How fucking great is that?  Here it is now.  He's got Froot Loops.  Oh, okay.  He's got the Froot Loops  and the big Tupperware  bucket of vomit  and he's now eating  the Froot Loops  out of his own vomit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, bravissimo.  Wow, that's entertainment.  Sergeant Magoo  is a good boy.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  Isn't this what  Pal Talk is all about?  He's eating fucking 
[03:44:00]  Froot Loops  out of his own puke.  Out of his own vomit.  I don't approve.  I don't approve.  Bravo.  Maybe I should have that.  It will help me shit.  He's got a big spoon  and he's just eating it.  It's this yellowy substance  because of the butter  and the milk  and the ketchup  and...  Wow.  He's a good boy.  You, my friend...  Let me see that.  Sergeant Magoo,  is he in for the eggnog eating?  Yes.  I say abso-fucking-lutely.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, he's been trying  to get us in the contest.  Yeah, he's in.  You're in.  All right, back to tuning in. 
[03:44:30]  All right, here we go.  All right, we're going to tune in Tokyo.  All right, here we go, here we go.  Blind guy is now going to feel...  By the way, if you're tuning in,  how big are those?  42.  It's 42 H,  but they might be bigger.  Hold on.  Could you guys turn a little sideways?  There we go.  We got to see.  Okay.  Just pull...  Yeah, pull it up  and just let him get a good...  Not too...  Now, go ahead.  There you go.  What do you think of those, sir?  Okay, you need to get off my tits, bud.  Why?  Why?  Why?  He was just getting to nipple.  What the hell happened?  I don't know what my...  He was just getting to nipple.  Oh, you got excited, didn't you?  No, I definitely didn't. 
[03:45:00]  No?  No.  What do they feel like?  Quite nice.  Yeah.  Quite nice.  Quite nice.  Wow.  He'd been jerking off for years.  Oh, absolutely.  Grabbing his pubic hair by accident.  Oh, my God.  He's just going to end up  on the freaking train with me,  like rubbing his crotch.  Go on.  Oh, he does that, yeah.  You know, staring at me?  No.  No, I don't do that.  No.  All right, one more time.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, you got to give him  a little more time with that.  Get more intense traumatizing.  You're rushing him.  How many seconds does he give?  There you go.  Now, just let him, yeah.  Let him get a good... 
[03:45:30]  He's a blind guy, so...  Let him read your nipple.  The sense of feel.  Why are you reading my nipples?  They're not braille.  What is...  Wow.  Keep grabbing them.  Yeah, go ahead.  Don't stop, you goof.  What is the nipple saying to you?  What does it say?  What is that?  Is that like...  It's an A.  It's an A?  No, it literally is in braille an A.  Isn't that ironic?  It's one dot.  An A being the smallest tits and you having those behemoths on your chest.  All right, get a nice squeeze going.  Yeah.  Get a good, like, massage.  Lift up.  Lift up.  Feel the weight. 
[03:46:00]  What do you think?  Nice, right?  Show her how you touch breasts.  Show her...  Get a critique on her on how your breast touching is.  She can help you here.  Yeah, she can.  She can help you out.  Touch them.  How would you normally touch tits?  That's fine.  That's fine?  Yeah.  Dude, this guy's going to lose his mind.  His breast touching is like, what's her name, was touching the face there.  You were like being in the studio in front of everyone watching me touch a girl's tits.  Hold on.  One person at a time has got to talk. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  It's kind of like being in the studio watching everyone touch...  You know, everyone watching me touch a girl's tits.  It's a big difference between...  Who, um...  Yeah, but you were just feeling them, like, again, I'm being critiqued, like, you know...  Yes, Ebert and Roper.  Who wants to show a blind guy how to feel up a girl?  Laura Dern.  That's who the girl was.  Wow.  It was like the way Laura Dern felt Rocky Dennis' face in masks.  That's how you were touching her tits.  He's sort of like...  And her tits were as big as his fucking head. 
[03:47:00]  Jesus.  No, actually, it reminded me of one night, he's, like, stroking his cat.  Yeah.  And, you know, like, the same sort of petting motion happening?  Yeah.  Because he's, like, kind of cautious and wary of, like, petting.  You were more experimentally touching than you were, like, getting any pleasure out of it.  Well, again, I'm in a studio full...  Sorry.  I'm in a studio full of people and...  But you don't know that.  You don't know that.  I don't know that.  I only think I am, yeah.  Actually, we're outside and we just have...  That's it.  We're actually...  We haven't even left my house.  I'm imagining.  Hey, this guy's got a sense of humor. 
[03:47:30]  Would you let her finger your ass?  Would I let her finger my ass?  Yeah.  Put a glove on.  She would never finger my ass.  Put a glove on, she would.  No, but I told him last night that I'd lick his father's asshole.  Remember that?  Oh, she did say that.  I was just fucking around.  Would you finger his butt with a glove on?  Yeah.  I would not finger his asshole ever.  No.  No.  I think you hit your line.  What?  Yeah, the boy's got to ask.  I think you hit your line.  My line.  There's a certain thing she won't do.  I will not finger the ass of a visually impaired friend.  Right. 
[03:48:00]  She will take black cock, though.  That's right.  Just not in the ass.  All right.  Well, would you let him hock a loogie on your clit?  Oh.  Then let him feel your clit.  No, I'm not letting him feel my clit.  Can he just shove his hand down the front of your pants?  No.  Just feel the outside.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Just the outside.  No, no.  We're talking Majora.  How about this?  As compared to Majora?  No, it's okay.  How about within an inch?  It's still skin.  Within an inch?  Yeah. 
[03:48:30]  Let's see how far you let him go down.  He'll take his hand real slow down the front of your pants, and then you can say stop at  any time.  Do you know how awkward this is going to be?  Like, that's what you guys love.  This is going to be so awkward on the street.  Dude, you'll be talking about this for years.  You'll hear it in the replays when we're on vacation.  Let's go.  I remember doing this with the retarded children in the playground when I was in school.  Oh, man.  I just got to be honest.  Yeah, we would.  No, they don't say nothing.  Really?  They don't know it's wrong.  I mean, that's the way it's supposed to be.  Everybody just feeling good together.  Oh, my God. 
[03:49:00]  I don't go, Paul.  You'd just kill yourself.  I don't go, Paul.  Stick his hand down there.  Oh, hey.  How old the girl are you?  19.  Not interested.  19?  Too old?  Mm, well.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  Nothing?  Well, you kind of explained the obvious, blind idiot.  Teasing a porn.  Is your joke?  Parted.  All right.  How was that?  Let's get a hand in the pants here.  Yeah.  Just down the front, and then you could, you know, you stop at any time. 
[03:49:30]  But really, give him a chance.  No.  How about your butt?  How about your butt cheeks?  Feel your butt.  My ass?  You're not your whole.  It's the cheeks.  Let him feel one cheek.  In my jeans?  Yeah.  No.  Grab her ass?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, kind of down the back of the pants.  What kind of panties do you have?  I have, like, boy shirts on.  Those are sexy.  Let me see them.  No.  Why?  You have a nice big butt.  What's wrong with you?  No, I'm not.  You have a body image problem.  Oh, I wonder.  I'm a fat chick.  Do you think I'm going to be hot?  You're proportioned, though.  Yeah, you're not bad. 
[03:50:00]  You've got to understand.  You see, you're proportioned, so it's not a bad thing.  If I'm a fat chick, you're not bad.  And you're 19.  So that takes a lot of damage points off.  Yeah, gravity's still on your side.  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  That's good.  That's good.  No, I'm not.  I don't want to get naked in studio.  Well, we're not talking about naked.  Yeah, like, shake my pants.  Maybe loosen your pants enough so he can slip his hand down for one ass-cheek feel.  Yeah, you should be flattered, because in five years, no one's going to be asking you  to do this stuff.  You know how to break a girl's heart. 
[03:50:30]  Sergeant Magoo is puking, by the way, on Pal Talk.  Oh, there he goes.  He's puking into his fucking bowl of Froot Loops.  He's puking the Froot Loops he just ate.  Oh, my God.  This guy is a repugnant human being.  He has to be in the studio.  He is heinous.  Can you redo the trick on Friday for us?  I'm sure he will.  Oh, yeah.  He's a good boy.  If he's listening, you know, Sergeant Magoo, you've got to bring in your Froot Loops on  Friday.  Please come in, Sergeant Magoo.  He is just vomiting away into that.  He's a sweet boy.  All right.  What else can we get?  All right.  Back of the pants.  He can grab my ass. 
[03:51:00]  Grab an ass-cheek.  All right.  Guide your hand.  I got it.  I got it.  All right.  Down.  And get in.  Get in.  No.  In.  In the underwear and everything.  Now, rub her ass-cheek.  You're feeling it with the back of your hand getting a nut job?  There we go.  There we go.  There we go.  All right.  Look, both.  I didn't think you had.  I got both.  Oh, you got both.  Now, kind of squeeze and rub and go down a little and off.  My ass-cheeks are so clenched at the moment.  I'm clenched them.  I'm clenched them.  I'm like Edward Norton in American History X right now. 
[03:51:30]  Oh.  That didn't work.  Feel for a pimple.  No pimples, no.  No, very smooth.  Very smooth.  Run your hand over her ass-crack.  No.  Just a little.  Just over the top of the ass-crack.  It's like legal molestation here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just the top of the ass-crack.  Top.  Okay, go ahead.  Yeah, I got it.  You like that?  It's nice.  See?  Very nice.  That's good.  You getting a rod?  Not with a room full of guys.  That means he does have a rod.  A little guy.  Grab his dick so he's got a rod.  Why don't you do this?  Through the pants.  Yeah, why don't you check the suit he's got a bone? 
[03:52:00]  Through the pants.  All right, pull your pants back down.  No.  Just take the platter, the palm of your hand, and place it against to see if he's got a  rod.  He's got these awful briefs on, and he always wears the same type of jeans, so it always  looks like he has a rod.  It's just like his package.  It either looks like a really fat cunt, or he's got like a, you know?  It's a great first appearance.  It looks like a fat cunt.  Wow.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Barrel feels good.  Yeah, Jim.  You like that? 
[03:52:30]  It was nice.  It was very nice.  All right, take the palm of your hand and just put it up against it to see if he's got  a rod.  It's a palm.  It's a palm.  You don't even have to grip it.  There you go.  Just push.  Feel around.  Anything?  No, it's like, no.  Yeah.  You can tell.  Punch him in the balls.  Oh, God.  All right.  Now what we want is the fat girl to suck on blonde guy's thumb.  Thumb?  Yeah.  Thumb?  Yeah.  No.  Why?  No.  That's too erotic.  You want to see a technique?  Yeah, we just want to see the technique.  Absolutely.  I have a great technique.  Well, you talked about it. 
[03:53:00]  Let's see it.  How about a banana?  Give her a banana.  No, a thumb.  A thumb.  Stupid.  I can't deep throw it or anything like that.  Yeah.  Well, a thumb, I hope you can.  Get his thumb, yeah.  A thumb is okay.  No, I can't.  Grab his fist like you would the balls, and then suck his  thumb, like it's a cock.  That's right.  All right.  I don't touch size.  Blonde guy is giving the thumbs up.  You don't touch balls?  No, I do not.  What?  Well, you and I would not.  I have to fucking really straighten her out.  I thought you said fat chicks.  Want to take me off for a threesome?  Who?  Us too?  Yeah.  You make two. 
[03:53:30]  Jimmy makes one.  You're more like an orgy with the tits.  Yeah, they're nice.  Oh, they're toddlers.  Yeah, we have a threesome.  You don't cup the balls or nothing like that?  No, I don't focus on it.  I mean, if they weren't hairy.  I'm not talking about sitting down there and taking them out to dinner.  I cup them unless they're hairy.  I'm not touching any hairy sack.  Why don't we tie her hands behind her back?  Yeah.  How about this?  You let Bob come and you're unprotected.  I'm not having blind babies.  God, I'm going to talk about that.  It's not genetic, you ass.  Wow.  Blind fat kids.  It's not genetic. 
[03:54:00]  God, they would be so fucked up.  Blind fat kids.  All feeling for the fridge.  Blind fat kids.  Blind fat kids.  Where's the cheeseburger?  You're in the garage.  Come inside.  They're eating the...  But he's blind.  You should have...  He's blind.  That's actually audio of him in his own garage with a car.  You should have...  You should have graded on a curve there.  He's blind.  Geez.  What's the wrong with my mouth?  Blind guys aren't that funny.  It's true.  Unless they're walking by cliffs. 
[03:54:30]  Oh, no.  All right.  What are we getting done?  All right.  A little cock sucking.  All right.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Let's go.  A little thumbs up in the air.  Let's go.  No, no, no, no.  No?  Come on.  I got to pee.  For the record, I'm trying to help out here.  Would you let him maybe suck on one of your nipples?  Oh, that's fair.  That'd be cool.  I don't think she'd let me do that.  Dude, he's blind.  No?  Barely let me touch him.  I don't think I'm sucking anything.  No.  He's blind.  Dude, don't cock block yourself, you fucking asshole. 
[03:55:00]  Jesus Christ.  We're trying to help you out here, Hendrix.  He's so self-deprecating after years of female abuse.  He really is.  We're like, we're working.  I know.  We already got your tits and ass.  That's true.  And every time we make an attempt for the next move, you're fucking saying, no, she ain't  gonna do it.  All I see is somebody bringing in like a fucking strap on over here and I'm worried.  You want to fuck him in the ass?  No, I do not want to fuck him in the ass.  Absolutely not.  That's okay.  Oh, there's a dildo.  You want to show us your technique on it?  Yeah, I guess I could.  All right.  Let's see what her technique looks like.  She's just grabbed. 
[03:55:30]  It's clean.  It's all brand new right out of the package.  We have a sponsor.  Right out of the package, yeah.  No, we really do.  I don't jerk off.  I just jerk off.  You just...  What?  You don't jerk at the same time?  No, I don't.  Just mouth.  I suck really hard.  You suck really hard?  Wait, wait, wait.  Take it out of your mouth.  Can you let blind guy push the back of your head?  Oh, what's the matter?  There's fucking shit all over this thing.  Well, it was used up in ass, but that is not shit.  I'm teasing, of course.  That is a used one.  This needs to be clean.  It wants to go in the wheelchair, Fred.  This needs to be clean.  Use a paper towel. 
[03:56:00]  Hey, good call back, my guy.  See?  Very good.  And spill a little of that water on there or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever you need.  Whatever you need.  Clean up that rubber cock.  And then, okay, now, how about we do this?  Yeah, let's put it by blind guy's cock and get on your knees and let him hold the back  of your head and show what it would look like if you were sucking his cock.  That's rock and roll. 
[03:56:30]  That's fair.  All right, blind guy, take the cock.  Put it down your...  I don't want to hear that again.  Hold it.  No, no, no.  It's the other way.  No.  Not even a hold.  Shove it down the front of your pants and pull it out your zipper so it looks a little  more authentic.  Yeah.  Yes?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just shove it out there.  Jimmy, we're getting so close to having this fat chick fuck this blind guy.  No.  By run and fed, we'll have it done.  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy. 
[03:57:00]  All right, blind guy is taking the dildo.  All right, give him the dildo.  He's looking for it.  All right.  There it is.  Now, shove it.  Don't be looking all day.  He's putting it through his underwear hole.  He's completely confused.  In the underwear.  Of course, he's backwards.  He doesn't know he just shoved it up his ass by accident.  All right.  What?  Oh, my God.  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's coming, all right?  Yeah.  All right.  He's shoving it through.  Why are your boxers wet?  This is rough.  Are the front of your boxers wet?  No, I'm teething.  No, I'm teething.  I thought he was... 
[03:57:30]  There we go.  All right.  Your dick's upside down.  Can you twist it 90 fucking 180 degrees?  There you go.  I know your eyes are defective, but what's wrong with your cock?  There you go.  Now it's good.  All right.  Now, you get on your knees.  I've got to stay in there.  Just hold it.  Hold it.  All right.  I'm holding it.  Don't worry.  Theater of the mindless.  All right.  Fat chick's on her knees.  All right.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck am I doing?  Now...  Yeah, I don't know.  Here we go.  This will look authentic.  I think we only met you on the street two hours ago.  I know.  What a whore.  Now you're the star.  Let's see your technique. 
[03:58:00]  All right.  Let's see the technique.  Okay.  All right.  Well, that's a...  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  She's got good technique there.  She's got a lot of...  She's got the head in her mouth.  There's fucking pubic hair on that.  So what?  It's just like real life.  Got dropped in a rug.  We got to make it authentic.  Now...  She's sucking pretty good, but I'd say it's a little bit...  Mm.  She...  Yeah, there you go.  You get a little hand in there.  Oh, oh.  Go slow.  Go slow.  Go slow.  You're sucking it too fast.  Slow.  Yeah. 
[03:58:30]  That's it.  You don't want to be harsh on it.  You want to suck soft?  I'm different with a real cock.  I'm just telling you.  Are your teeth hitting that?  No.  No.  Do you have a gag reflex?  I do.  Unless it's a big rib.  All right.  Let's get...  Let's hear the gag reflex.  Yeah.  Get that mic in there.  I almost gagged.  Hey, blind guy, grab the back of her head.  Yeah.  Grab the back of her head.  Just grab the back of her head.  All right.  Now, there you go.  Yeah, there you go.  Now, kind of...  Now, now...  There you go.  Suck the...  Now, dude, push her fucking head.  Yeah.  Keep going.  Dude, you gagged her with your huge cock. 
[03:59:00]  You'll never hear that sound again as long as you live.  Wow, she's gagging.  And cut.  Wait, we didn't get a clear audio.  I would do it again.  Yeah, she did.  No, one more.  You had fine audio on that.  One more.  Actually, we were all talking over it.  Can I do that on Norton's cock?  Can we do it one more time?  All right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  We're all talking.  Everyone quiet.  Quiet.  Do the same thing.  All right.  Go ahead.  This blind guy is smiling.  You got to see how violent he is holding this shit. 
[03:59:30]  We are the best charity for blind people.  It was your mouth in there.  Who's crying?  I'm not crying.  I'm laughing.  He's laughing.  There's no crying in cocks on Iraq.  The blind side is leaking something.  Well, it's a blind eye.  Probably valuable fluid.  I was going to say, the rest of his eye, it's like, that mystical fluid that makes an eyeball  see.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that was just horrific.  That was.  Wow.  That was a good gag.  That was a radio goal.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Well, you, uh, let's see what else. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah, you don't take in much, but it seems like you do a good job with that.  What do you want?  Being a rookie.  You know.  You know.  How long you been, actually, you said you lost your virginity.  How long you been second night pack?  Cock-soaking since, like, ninth grade.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay, well, then.  Wow.  I say we have, uh, let's see what else we can do.  I say blind guy, dildo in the position you had it in.  Yeah.  And a little, uh, little TFing.  No, no.  You want to let him titty fuck you with the dildo?  The fake thing?  Yeah, you guys.  I've done enough.  No.  How are you going to top cock-soaking? 
[04:00:30]  TFing would be up there.  That's kind of secondary.  You know, we do recommend you do this voluntarily.  Yeah.  Yeah, no.  Because, uh, afterwards, it just becomes a crime.  You don't want dental implants, do you?  Because, uh, yeah.  We've been known to just, you know, rape.  I'm good.  I'm teasing, of course.  Are you good?  You tapping out?  Yeah.  All right.  She's been a good egg.  Jimmy, what are you doing?  Jimmy's all worked up.  I'm saying, she's all fucking helping brothers out. 
[04:01:00]  Wow.  You want me to help you, Norton?  Oh.  Is your girlfriend going to be okay with that?  No, she would be mad.  No, she would be mad.  She'd be mad.  She doesn't have to.  Yeah.  It's fine.  Well, no, she would probably hear.  Well, you know what, though?  Actually, uh, Norton and I had an account for years and years ago.  What was it?  Uh, I was on the show once.  Like, I don't know if you guys remember, uh, like, Stalker Kristen, like, Ben Stalker.  Yeah, I remember.  I read up a poem and shit like that.  And, uh, like, I got your email address and we started, like, talking a couple of times  and we were on the phone a couple of times.  But, uh, obviously I said I was, I'm 19 right now. 
[04:01:30]  So, that was a couple of years ago.  Oh.  And, and obviously I didn't do anything with him because he thought I was, like, 19.  Hi, Jim.  Uh, were you trying to get slacked?  But, no, she said I thought she was older, which is true.  Yeah, and you know what?  I was a good egg and I didn't do anything with him because I didn't want to get him in trouble.  I don't fuck with an age girl.  I'll do anything but.  I'm no underage girls.  You won't, but Uncle Paul will.  Certainly would, uh.  You see, I'm getting tired of this.  You just, the age of consent, it's not constitutional. 
[04:02:00]  It's all about feeling good, playing a tickle game.  Everyone is saying make Flea suck it.  Wow.  Flea, would you suck some cock for us?  No, for the show.  No.  It's a fake.  For the show.  No.  Dump some milk on it.  Some cream.  Some heavy cream.  All right, let's go to Justin on Long Island.  Justin.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[04:02:30]  Yo, is it bad that I got a hard arm for listening to this chick?  It's a little twisted because they're, like, really good friends and, uh, we got them  to do a lot of things today.  Yeah.  I want to slap her with my penis.  That I'd like to do.  All right, would you let Jimmy slap you with his penis?  It makes, like, a pshh sound.  Oh, she said, why not?  All right, back on your knees.  On the cheek.  On the cheek, though.  I've never had anybody cock smack you for that.  It's going to be soft.  It's a cock slap.  Patty's had it done.  Patty's had it done.  It makes a nice little pshh sound.  All right, we got fat chick on her knees.  Wow, she is right, right on her knees for this one. 
[04:03:00]  Hold on, I'm all tangled up with headphones.  Wait, why am I right here?  I don't want to see you.  She's around, Moe.  Don't look, Bill.  Yeah, make your own.  Don't look.  Don't look, Bill.  Move that pal-talk camera.  I don't like cock showing up.  Move your hair so I don't hit your hair.  I don't care.  And take those glasses off so you can't identify anyone.  Okay.  All right, we all got to be quiet, too.  All right, Jimmy, the floor is yours.  Hold on.  I'm not watching this shit.  You don't have to watch.  You face that way, you fuck.  I was.  Yeah, right now, you're watching TV.  Enjoy it.  You're blind, not gay.  Okay. 
[04:03:30]  Now, you have to put your face closer.  Okay.  Shh, shh, shh.  Oh, my God.  Okay, with a double tap.  It was a bad slap.  I think you've got to try it again.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, that was my...  It's got to be a little more...  No, it was my knuckle.  Something got messed up.  Okay.  Hold on.  Shh.  Good dick slapping.  Oh, my God.  Now, comparatively speaking, what did you think of Jimmy's dick? 
[04:04:00]  I think she saw it.  No, I saw it a little bit.  Yeah?  It was nice.  Nice.  Soft.  Nicer than blind guy.  Why don't you just...  Unfortunately, it's white.  No, they're both just too careful.  No, I'm sure they're both delightful.  Yeah, delightful.  Delightful.  Mm-hmm.  That's good.  All right.  Wow.  What a show.  We learned a lot today.  We really did.  Who's Glenn?  Glenn's a good friend of ours who just called us up when we were doing the one.  Hi, Glenn.  And he's also the ex-boyfriend of Krista the Blind Girl. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  Cool.  Oh.  Oh.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I can't wait for this contest for all time.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be great.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You guys were great today.  You guys were great today.  You guys...  Great job.  Real trooper.  Hey, blind guy who loves the Islanders, because I see the Islander...  There's a lot of times I go to the Islander games, and I got four season tickets, and sometimes  I don't have...  I got some empty seats next to me.  If you could find where I sit...  What section are you in?  I know the place like the back of my hand.  If you could find where I sit, and you see an empty seat there, come on down. 
[04:05:00]  Empty seats all over the fucking place sometimes.  Come on down.  I'm sure you'll get it off the air.  I'm like...  Off the air, buddy.  Off the air.  I'm in the hundreds.  I'm where the...  Behind the benches.  Where the opposing team comes out in that area.  I don't know the exact section.  I swear to God, I already tell you.  Okay.  Oh, wait.  One...  No, I don't remember.  I'm being honest.  I forgot.  Gotcha.  All right.  Oh, no.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Everyone's saying they want Jimmy to slap Flea's cheek with his dick.  That would be so hot.  Just finish another half and half. 
[04:05:30]  Fucking kid's drinking nonstop.  All right.  You're in the contest, unfortunately.  Yeah.  He's in.  You're in, Flea.  Magoo's going down.  Where's Magoo live?  Let's start talking smack about a guy that fucking vomited into a bowl, filled it up with Fruit  Loops, and ate it.  You cannot talk smack about that guy.  You better do that on Friday.  He will.  Good.  He is a trooper.  All right.  Where are you doing?  Really no reason to talk to you guys any further.  So, have a good day.  That's it.  Thank you so much. 
[04:06:00]  Great job.  Thanks for having us.  Wow.  I think we could have worn him down if we had more time.  Yeah.  I think we could have worn him down and really gotten him to maybe have some kind of sex.  A plug for what?  A plug.  F.H. Riley's in Huntington?  Use the plug that was in your ass when you wanted to get a shit.  I'll just talk over his plugs.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  That was great, Flee.  Talked over all those plugs. 
[04:06:30]  He didn't know.  He didn't have headphones on.  Dolt.  Wow.  What a bang-up show today, huh?  We did some things today.  That was a fun show.  We rarely do that anymore.  On New Year's Eve, I'll be celebrating with my friends.  What's Tom Chiasano doing out there?  See, Tom, that's how we do a show.  Yeah.  Now, that's a program.  That's right.  Cock slapping, a lot of laughs.  A lot of dick slapping.  He's just trying to talk to them because they're probably potential sponsors, and he's trying 
[04:07:00]  to talk loud every time something happens.  Yeah.  So, yeah, the guys don't always do stuff like this.  A little embarrassing when there's no FCC, isn't there?  All right.  Wait a minute.  John in Arizona, what's wrong?  Hey, John, what's going on?  I'm not complaining.  I was just wondering how come you didn't push it to the limit, man.  I push it to the limit?  Wait, what limit, John?  Are you saying I didn't push it to the limit?  How?  No, no, no, no.  I thought he was going to get it to go all the way, like he said.  He wouldn't do it?  She wouldn't do it?  We didn't do it.  We didn't do it.  Rape her?  She wouldn't do it?  Yeah.  John, we did pretty good.  You can only go as far as she wants to go. 
[04:07:30]  We really did pretty good.  Unless you're in the back of your sleeper cab, I'm sure.  We really did pretty good.  All right.  It's time for the line of the day.  We have one.  We got two.  We got none.  Two.  Two.  One or up and a winner.  All right.  Bodogfight.com sponsors line of the day.  Here is today's runner-up line of the day.  You know what we should do with her ears?  What?  Cut them off and put them in the hands of a small wind-up monkey so he can smack them together. 
[04:08:00]  You got a big laugh there, Anthony.  All right.  Bodogfight.com.  Log on and watch American fighters battle for the right to represent the U.S. in a bout against the Russians.  It's all on Bodogfight.com.  I want to acknowledge Jimmy, though, and that whole thing.  The whole using her ears for something.  Very funny, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Very funny.  It was fun to jump on that bandwagon.  Here is today's... 
[04:08:30]  Hit it, Bill.  Jesus.  Bill.  Bill.  Hit it.  Hit the button.  Bill.  Hit the button.  He's waiting for this part.  Bill.  Go.  No.  I'll be tells you, you idiot.  Stop it.  No matter what I fucking say, stop it.  No matter what I say, you don't fucking hit the button.  Why did you hit it when I said stop? 
[04:09:00]  You pointed and said go.  I know.  I don't do that.  It's Opie's job.  No, it's not.  It's Jimmy's job.  All right.  Jimmy will cue it.  I don't like the fact that I'm going to wave.  I fucking waved my arm.  Four minutes later, Bill decides to hit the button.  Or half a second.  Half a second.  Whatever it was.  Here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[04:09:30]  Line of the day.  Your ears should be on the elbows of a gentleman's smoking jacket.  Get me my pipe and her ears.  I'm going to retire to the study.  Gentlemen.  That's good.  Bravo.  Jimmy Norton with line of the day.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's just go home now.  I think we had a good show. 
[04:10:00]  And tomorrow over and now we have Jet in studio performing a little bit of some songs.  Joe Rogan.  Oh, good.  Roll with me.  I haven't seen Rogan in a long time.  And it's the day before the Eggnark drinking concert.  Why is Rogan in town?  Do we know?  Joseph.  I don't know.  Probably a fight.  Really?  Probably got a rumble.  All right.  We got meetings to do.  All right.  Caroline.  What?  You asked what Rogan was doing in town.  Oh, he was doing Caroline.  Oh, cool.  We didn't actually need an answer.  Yeah, Steve. 
[04:10:30]  Is everything fucking rhetorical around here?  Oh.  Even that question was.  Steve was asking himself.  Wow.  That's right.  Look at Steve.  Why'd I get fired won't be rhetorical, will it?  When fucking the bosses crack down.  Yeah, someday we will.  That fucking Minnelli tie yesterday, by the way.  John Minnelli walked in with my grandmother's curtains hanging off his neck.  And I said to him, that's a heck of a tie.  And he proudly went, yeah, I just bought it.  And I backed off. 
[04:11:00]  That fucking, that awful.  He was wearing a sofa cushion material.  Yes.  John Minnelli dresses like it's 1948.  He really knows radio, but he doesn't know dress.  Oh, my God.  That tie was atrocious.  Yeah.  And his suit jackets.  Well, he has one he bought from the James Cagney estate.  He goes, yeah, this is what James Cagney wore.  When?  When he was murdered in white heat?  He's into tweeds. 
[04:11:30]  I'm going to do Minnelli a favor.  I'm going to break into his house.  And I'm going to fucking torch his wardrobe.  And we're going to start off with Sabbath shirts.  That tie he had on yesterday.  You know what it is?  It's the arm part of a fucking sofa.  But you take some of the material off it.  It's one of those, like, half a fucking...  That's grandma's house.  The arm cushions you'd take off, you'd put them over your head when you were a kid.  Hi, look, I'm King Tut.  I'm King Tut, ma.  Where are you going?  I'm the boy king.  All right. 
[04:12:00]  All righty.  We're through about now.  Thank you for listening.  Thank you for joining us.  Sergeant McGill fucking rules.  Yeah, we'll see you in Friday.
