<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts and Jimmy Norton crudely mocking a Maury Povich episode featuring individuals with physical differences, including children with severe skin conditions and a girl born without a mouth.  A caller, Alan, added to the commentary by mentioning Megan the Dwarf and Elvina, further fueling the insensitive jokes.  Audio clips from the Maury show, particularly the segment featuring the "whistling face" girl, were played and met with more mocking laughter and commentary.  This was abruptly interrupted by a live police chase unfolding on Fox News, which became a central focus of the show. The hosts and callers provided a running, excitedly descriptive commentary, filled with dark humor and wishes for the driver's harm, as he sped down the highway in a stolen tractor-trailer full of burning wood.

Heidi Fleiss then joined the show.  Her interview focused on her experiences in the sex industry and her new DVD, with sexually explicit and crude jokes exchanged between her and the hosts.  The discussion of her pricing, client interactions, and unusual requests intertwined with the ongoing police chase commentary. Fleiss recounted a humorous anecdote about a sexual encounter in prison after being surrounded by lesbians.

A young listener, Gary, called in to discuss his dating life, mentioning a relationship with a thirteen-year-old girl, prompting some concern from the hosts.  A Stephen Lynch song, "Down to the Old Pub Instead," with crude lyrics about menstruation, was played.  The show then briefly touched upon the Red Cross's handling of 9/11 relief funds before transitioning to a segment with radio personality Scorch, who promoted his upcoming charity event and website.  A lengthy interview with Robin Leach followed, covering his role in *The Rocky Horror Show*, his past career, and various humorous anecdotes.  The interview was punctuated by frequent interruptions, side conversations, off-color jokes, and listener calls containing unsubstantiated claims about Leach's personal life, including tangents about sexual encounters.

The show continued with a discussion on men's fear of rejection when approaching attractive women, using crude analogies like "eating the peach" and "balloon knot."  Robin Leach, still in the studio, was the target of jokes about his physique and past work.  He discussed his *Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous* experience, contrasting his on-screen persona with his current self. A caller challenged Leach's reputation using National Enquirer photos, leading to a discussion about photographic angles and perceived shrinkage.  Rich Voss, another in-studio guest, was also frequently the butt of jokes.  He recounted a declined proposition for a sex act with women in a waiting room, and his new car became a topic of conversation.

Two women from Philadelphia, described as having "more dents than Rich Voss' car," were introduced.  Initially intended as a distraction during a foosball game, their attempts were met with jokes about their appearance and bodies.  The conversation quickly devolved into vulgar banter about their bodies, sexual acts, and insults aimed at Voss.  Revealing themselves as adult film performers, they discussed their "swinging" lifestyle. Voss’s incessant interruptions and inappropriate comments significantly disrupted a planned "lesbian couch" segment.  The women’s website addresses were repeatedly mentioned.

The show concluded with another segment featuring two women promoting their website, MyHottieWife.com, which depicted them in various sexual acts. Opie, Anthony, and Rich Voss engaged in sexually explicit banter with the women, focusing on the website's content and making numerous crude jokes, including references to "Big Black Seas," "A-beads," and "the Bone Ranger." Callers Frankie, John, and Tom added to the sexually suggestive commentary.  The hosts attempted to convince the women to appear on the following show, the Ron and Fez show, ending with a final sexually explicit comment. The broadcast then concluded with a review of listener calls summarizing the show's many humorous and often offensive moments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I'm going after the chick at the bar with a five-foot-high hairdo.  But only from the front, because she plows it all up to the front and hairsprays it.  The peacock hairstyle. The peacock, the waterfall.  And if she says no, I'm going to plant my capizios in her groin.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Wish Abney.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philadelphia, PA. 
[00:00:30]  Philly sent us some lesbians today.  A couple of girls want to do lesbian for a day a little later on.  Nicey night.  866-277-4WOW for everyone in Philly and everywhere else listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jimmy Norton in the studio with us once again today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Adam, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up, man? 
[00:01:00]  Hey, did you guys see Maury today?  Did we see Maury Povich?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Like all those freaks.  Yeah, we did see it, man.  The title of the show was, I know I look different, but don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid.  Who's going to be afraid of someone whose bones sound like a twig?  Well, they had a couple of different children on today.  They had the two girls that skin was flaking, the flaky skin girls. 
[00:01:30]  That was, that one, that one got to me a little bit.  It sounds like, you know, nothing big.  Like you just got dry skin, use a little Vaseline intensive care, everything's fine.  But no, these girls were like red.  They were red, their skin very sensitive and flaking at all times.  Yeah, their skin just constantly peels off.  Falling off.  And they, of course, they're crying because they have no friends in school and that whole thing.  Then they had the girl that came out with the whistling face.  She was born without a mouth. 
[00:02:00]  Some little mouth that looked like it was whistling.  And now she gets this operation where they give her kind of a mouth.  But it still looks like when she's just standing there that she's whistling.  So we're watching the whole thing.  The audience is going, whenever they have her face on the screen, we're just going.  And it looked good.  It was great.  She was a mess.  She had, what, one finger?  One finger on one hand and then she had no legs.  Yeah, I had fake legs.  She amputated her legs. 
[00:02:30]  And then they got to get her to do like freak show stuff.  Because it's not just freaky enough for Maury to just bring them out and show them to his audience that is enjoying the freak show.  He's got to get them to do things.  So he gets the no-legged girl video of her dancing.  She likes to dance.  So she's dancing and spinning around.  And then they brought out a kid with no arms.  Yeah, six years old or something like that.  Yeah.  And, of course, they got to make him wear a tank top.  He comes out with a tank top.  A tank top so you could see, after all the video of him in the pool with no shirt on, so you could see where his arms are supposed to be coming out of his trunk, that he doesn't have any arms. 
[00:03:00]  But I will say, by the way, the one advantage to a little fellow with no arms is there are no fingernails to find DNA evidence under.  Well, there's one upside.  Right off the bat, Jim.  There's an upside.  There you go.  But they put him in the clothing that is best suited to showing off their freak.  And then he's like, hey, you're a special boy, aren't you?  And you have a lot of fans here at the Maury Show.  A lot of fans at the Maury Show. 
[00:03:30]  So can I get your autograph?  And he pulls out a picture of the kid.  And now the kid has to use his feet to sign the picture.  Instead of just saying what he wanted to do.  Hi, people want to see the freak do things with his feet.  Could you write something?  You got a lot of fans around the Maury Show.  You're a special kid.  So could you sign an autograph for me?  Yeah, sure, Maury.  And you're hanging that up at your house.  Yeah, but that wasn't good enough.  He goes, we followed him around for a typical day.  Typical day.  Could you make sure we get there so we watch him brush his teeth, comb his hair, and eat breakfast? 
[00:04:00]  Right.  Great, Maury.  Who's kidding who?  That's not a typical.  Well, I guess it's a typical day for him.  Typical day, but they got to make sure they see it.  And then all of a sudden he's in a pool.  He's playing PlayStation with his feet.  Playing PlayStation with his feet.  And then they show him going off to school.  And his mother straps on that helmet.  And then I'm like, well, he's not like a retarded kid or nothing like that.  Where they just bang their heads against the bricks.  It was a leather helmet.  And Hank goes...  Norton said that. 
[00:04:30]  No, but you go, why the helmet?  And when you say Norton...  Just something about after his school he likes to play football in the 1930s.  Yeah, it looked like one of those old GIF football helmets.  The leather ones.  And then Rick brought up that if he falls down with no arms, he's hitting his head.  So I guess that's why they strapped the helmet on.  Hey, there's someone watching the show right now in Columbus.  Alan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I can barely hear you.  What's up?  Nothing, man.  I'm watching the show right now and they've got Megan the Dwarf and Elvina. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Feels like she's just the right height, just the right to lick her cooch.  Well, she's three foot tall.  She has dwarfism and very huge cans.  The dwarfism didn't affect the boobs, obviously.  My gosh.  Yeah, they showed her.  She was the other freak they brought out.  Her and her friend.  And she's a dwarf, but she's got the biggest cans.  On a normal woman, these would be huge, huge tees.  And she comes out and they had her favorite band on.  What was the band's name?  LFO. 
[00:05:30]  I'm watching it right now.  LFO.  As we speak, LFO is on the screen.  I hope I didn't ruin the surprise that Marty was bringing LFO out.  Oh, sorry.  I hope I didn't ruin it.  But then you see...  Oh, Maury Trichter.  Yeah, Maury Trichter.  Here's a videotape message because they're on tour.  They're on tour.  They're on tour.  LFO can make it today.  Oh, we're just kidding.  Come on out and dance like a freak for everybody.  Meet LFO and dance.  Shake that big, protruding, midget ass of yours around.  Could you do that?  Hey, dude, are you watching her on the screen now? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I'm watching her right now.  Doesn't she look like Sam Kinison?  Yeah, my favorite band's LFO.  That's pretty cool, man.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, I'm a midget.  But it's great.  I got these big cans.  Yeah, they're great, man.  Hey, want to squeeze my cans, man?  Yes, Al.  Hey, I'm from Columbus.  You guys are huge down here.  You suck.  First time calling, long time listener.  Bye, guys.  We love the Columbus, and you're the first normal Columbus call we've had in about two 
[00:06:30]  weeks, so the rest of Columbus is going to appreciate that, Al.  All right, thanks, man.  All right, bro.  Bye.  Hey, LFO buddies, man.  You want to TF Sam Kinison, man?  She did look like Kinison.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  Awful little barrel chest.  Little twerp.  She's got a bunt.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, man.  You know what's funny to me is after they embarrassed and shamed these people,  they offered that woman a dress.  You've got to be kidding me. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, yeah, the one that had the whistling mouth.  The whistling mouth.  And don't be mistaken.  Hold on.  Whistle mouth, three foot tall, 45 pounds, 18 years old, one finger, no legs.  Right.  What's her dress?  Let's not just think she looks cute with her whistling little mouth.  There's a lot going on there, and she can't show any emotion with her face.  Like, there's no facial muscles in her eyes or cheeks or anything.  So, at one point, she starts crying, and the only reason you can tell she's crying is  a little tear poured out of her eye.  Yeah, but...  There was no sad face or nothing. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, because her face doesn't move at all.  Right.  What do you got?  That's the audio.  Oh, you got some audio of that?  Great.  Got the audio.  Let's play it here.  My name is Zara, and I'm 18 years old.  I was born with a whistling face signal.  My face is always frozen in this position.  It looks like I'm ready to whistle.  I'm also very small for my age.  I'm only two feet tall.  Growing up, I was teased a lot.  People made fun of me and told me that, like, I had a mask on their face. 
[00:08:00]  People used to call me names, like, Monster, and so many other things that hurt me.  Every night I dreamed that I wish I would wake up and be different.  But if you were to walk me in my shoes, you would know what it feels like to be made fun of.  Wait, merciful crap!  No, I didn't want to like to avoid family.  I want a family.  And I want kids just like everybody else. 
[00:08:30]  Whoa, calm down, huh?  I really want that nobody's going to love me.  I'm an 18-year-old girl, and that's the way I want to be treated.  I'm not a freak.  I'm a human being.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't see what...  It's coming right for us!  Born without a mouth, as God intended, living to be.  Oh, God damn!  Tony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I can't stop laughing.  You guys are killing me.  Hey, what's up? 
[00:09:00]  I just wanted to make a point that the one with the whistling mouth looked like a flying monkey from The Wizard of Oz.  Oh, Jesus.  Which one?  The whistling mouth.  I don't know if I saw her.  You have to see it.  She looks just like a flying monkey.  Oh, my God.  That was...  Thank you, Tony.  That was so horrible to watch.  But you know something?  We get grief, because we're making light of the situation.  I have another clip from Whistle.  Oh, do you?  Yeah.  The whistling girl. 
[00:09:30]  There are some things you think about, and it's not great.  And it's like...  Do you have a boyfriend?  No, I do not.  But you are pretty good.  Oh, isn't that cute?  Imagine how horned up she is, though.  She's 18.  You know?  One finger pointing at you.  All those hormones pumping through that puny, putrid little body.  You'd never know if she had an orgasm by that dumb, dead, waxy face.  Did you or didn't you? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  Holy...  Thank you, stroke mouth.  You are horrible.  I can't even take this.  What happened to you last night, man?  What happened to you?  It's just horrible.  You're beyond mean today, man.  Holy yes.  There's a point to this discussion, isn't there?  Yeah, Marty's trying to fool everyone.  He gets...  And if you watch the show, you know it. 
[00:10:30]  You saw him.  It's a very special...  I think you're pretty.  He had a...  Because the little flaky face kids were crying.  Vaseline all over their faces to keep them from flaking all over his nice studio couches.  Right, in his suit and everything.  But then she starts crying and sad and everything.  I think I got a clip of Maury talking to those kids.  What, don't you lie?  People teach you a lot.  People teach you a lot.  Okay.  Well, guess what?  You don't have a right to be teased because you're beautiful.  You know that? 
[00:11:00]  You're very pretty.  You know that?  Now, Maury...  Maury's telling us...  Now, you can't lie to the kid.  Maybe she is beautiful on the inside.  That's how it works.  Everyone's beautiful on the inside.  Right.  It's all pink.  It's all pink on the inside.  But Maury's like, just BSing.  I'm going to be just like you right now.  You know what I'm going to do for you?  Because you're a special girl and you're beautiful.  I'm going to rub Vaseline on my face and stick my face in oatmeal. 
[00:11:30]  So Maury looks just like you.  First, I'm going to go in a tanning booth.  And I'm going to put the setting on 100 and just...  I'm going to burn my face irreparably red.  Then I'm going to smear Vaseline on it so it's that shiny red look like you have.  Then I'm going to put nair on spots on my head so I have very thin hair.  Then I'm going to plunge my Vaseline-coated face into some of those mashed potato flakes. 
[00:12:00]  Then I'm going to scrape myself with a cheese grater.  And I'll look beautiful just like you because you're special.  And I want to be special.  Just like you.  Why are you so upset?  Because I wish they were normal like everybody else.  They're in the club.  But they're better than normal.  They're special.  Yeah.  Think about it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you exploiting bag of J.I.'s. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, we're very distracted because there's a great police chase going on right now.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  We're all sitting here at Fox cheering and yelling and playing the Indiana Jones theme in the background.  Yeah, explain this because we've got a lot of people in their cars and stuff.  Right now there's a tractor trailer that's been stolen in, I think, Southern California  with a load of wood on the back of it.  And it appears right now that the load of wood is on fire. 
[00:13:00]  How did it catch on fire?  I don't know.  I think they might have tried to fire something at it.  Oh, it's dragging a forklift and the heat.  It's got a forklift behind it, but the forklift's on fire with a pallet of wood.  God, you can only hope it explodes and runs into a crowd of Afghanis.  Driving to a mosque.  Driving to a mosque.  Oh, God, Mark.  That's a huge fire.  You have to understand, everybody here at Fox News is all glued around TVs, and we're  cheering in the entire...  He's still going... 
[00:13:30]  Wow, that is on fire now.  Yeah.  That's a massive fire.  Oh, please get the fuel tanks.  I want to see this thing explode.  It's going to be a while before those fuel tanks blow up.  Although the fuel on the back of that, the forklift...  The forklift runs on like propane or something, so hopefully that'll blow up.  Whoa.  Oh, you have it undelayed, right?  There it is.  The forklift just exploded.  Oh, there's a flaming thing rolling down the street. 
[00:14:00]  Holy Jesus.  What is that?  A flaming projectile is going down the street.  Holy ash.  This guy ain't stopping for nothing.  He's making a U-turn.  Yeah, the tanks just exploded on the back of the thing.  And a fiery fuel tank went flying off.  Now the wheels are on fire?  Oh, the back tires.  I hope he doesn't stop.  This is in Texas, by the way.  I apologize.  Texas.  Yeehaw.  So they'll probably just shoot him when he gets out of the truck.  Fort Worth, Texas.  You can only hope.  Man, you guys have the best police chases on Fox. 
[00:14:30]  See, we're on, you guys are seeing the delay, so that's why I screamed a little bit before  you saw that.  Yeah.  God, is that classic.  This guy ain't stopping, though.  What a trooper.  I love this.  This will be on scariest police chases.  That's good.  I like the distractions we get from our own problems.  Because this guy is truly effed when he comes out of that cab.  The knee in the back of the neck.  But, Anthony, what was he doing? 
[00:15:00]  I mean, was he trying to build a house with this?  I mean, come on.  Yeah, why would you steal a tractor trailer full of lumber?  With a forklift on the back of it.  I say drugs.  I say white guy.  What do you think?  Something else just fell off.  Here we go.  Now the trailer's starting to move.  There's flaming stuff falling.  Oh, the whole load's ready to fall off because the ties came off of it.  Oh, my God.  Everything's falling off the damn thing.  This guy is a classic chase guy. 
[00:15:30]  I love it.  And he's not stopping.  I love the balls.  He's getting off the highway right now.  Yeah, what a hero.  You know what's great?  When they get out, because I love the Wildest Police Chases show and stuff.  When they get out and they say, okay, I give up, and they stand there with their hands on their head  and expect to be cordially cuffed and led to the car, and they get tackled by ten cops who then pummel him.  Watch this, the cop going across the grass here.  Oh, he's trying to head him off at the pass.  Well, it ain't going to happen.  Yeah, what is it the cops can't stop that?  This guy's got, you guys got the Indiana Jones music playing in the background. 
[00:16:00]  They were just playing the Benny Hill theme song, too.  That guy's tire is on fire, is what that is now.  Yeah, his tire is spinning and burning, and flaming rubber is shooting off of it.  He's just scraping along now.  They've got a white van following.  I don't know who the guy in a white van is.  It's O.J.  It's O.J.  I'll show you where to go.  I'm just going to my mother's house.  And Al Cowlings is driving.  We're looking for Pedro Guerrero, who's in the cab of that truck. 
[00:16:30]  Watch this.  He's coming across the highway.  Here he goes.  Watch this.  I went into, oh, my God.  That's not a good move.  Now he's cutting across.  Look at the people running.  They're getting out of their cars and running.  They're getting out of their cars and running.  Uh-oh.  This could be right here.  Hey, what's the matter?  Come on, guys.  Step on the gas.  Oh, he's stuck.  Don't pussy out.  Oh, he's stuck.  Don't pussy out.  He's stuck.  Here they go.  They jumped out of the air.  Here come the cops.  Oh, here come the cops.  They're running.  Shoot him.  Shoot him.  Oh, my God.  They're shooting at him.  Oh, they're shooting at him.  Oh, yes.  That rocks.  Did they shoot him, Mark? 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  I think that he's, I'll tell you right now.  He's weaving off the road a little.  He's not really stepping on the gas.  Maybe he's dead.  It's still rolling forward after they shot at him.  You've got to tell us.  I've got a seven-second lead on you guys.  Well, it looks like he's stepping on the gas now.  He's still going.  It looks like he's okay.  Bullets can't stop him.  It's Ron Reagan.  What a hero.  Ron Reagan's driving.  Bullets never stopped him.  I just had a day for my daughter's birthday party. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  What a great chase.  Coming up to another intersection here.  Oh, another intersection?  Right through it.  The cops got traffic stopped, it looks like.  And he's through that intersection safely.  And he's accelerating from the looks of it.  I guess they didn't shoot him good enough.  No, he definitely didn't.  He must have been ducking.  The guy should have had the shotgun out.  What's he shooting with a pistol for?  I don't know.  And it's still on fire.  The one is falling right into the fire.  Look at that.  I think it's about to slip off the back. 
[00:18:00]  The girls with Vaseline faces.  Oh, God.  You are horrible, Norton.  And continuing down the road.  Boy, that didn't stop him.  That was their chance to really stop him right there.  Oh, that was a great shot.  It's like the OJ chase, too.  Look at all the people.  He's crossing the divider now.  Watch this.  Oh, he crosses the divider?  Oh, he's on the load.  Watch this.  Oh, he's on the other side of the road now.  Oh, get out of the way.  Oh, this guy's good.  Jamming gears. 
[00:18:30]  Eastbound and down.  Loaded up and trucking.  This guy's got to be on crystal method or something.  Dude, but he stalled it out a little bit there before.  Everyone here in the control room is screaming, go, go, go, go.  You got the snow, man.  Our load's on fire, bandit.  Watch this.  All right, here he goes.  There's a huge intersection.  What's he doing, a U-turn?  Oh, my God.  He's going in and out of the cars here.  He's about to lose the load off the side.  That's a blatant disrespect to the law. 
[00:19:00]  That was a good maneuver around all the cop cars and the intersection.  Watch this.  Watch this.  All the lumber's going off.  Uh-oh.  Oh, there he goes.  All the lumber's just flying off the back of it now.  Oh, my God.  Now he's shaking it all off.  He's shaking it off.  Watch this.  Oh, he's driving back and forth to shake the lumber off.  Wow.  That is good.  Whoever wrote this show should win an Emmy, man.  This is a good script.  Wow.  This is great.  Give me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper. 
[00:19:30]  Make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  This guy rocks.  He lost a lot of the award.  I think when it was falling off, he figured he'd just weave back and forth until it all fell into the road.  He shook it off like a wet dog.  All right.  He's going to make a move now.  He's making a move to the other side of the street.  Yeah, everyone runs over.  They want to be close and see it, but then they run away.  That trailer is really on fire now.  Oh, he's going to take out a...  Whoa.  Uh-oh. 
[00:20:00]  What did he hit?  Nothing.  He almost took out a street light.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Very close.  Now he's trying to...  Is he going to attempt another U-turn in the tractor trailer?  Where is he going now?  There's no wheels left in the back of the trailer.  He's dragging the trailer, and the friction is starting more fires on the wood.  That's great.  Do they know how fast he's going, Mark?  Because we don't have the audio here.  Yeah, no.  I'm not even sure.  He's going back and...  He's probably doing about 35 or 40.  Now he's back into incoming traffic.  Yeah, oncoming traffic.  Oncoming traffic. 
[00:20:30]  That's good.  He's weaving back and forth.  He's...  Oh!  He's slowing down.  What is he doing?  This is great.  Oh, he's slowing down.  He's weaving back and forth.  Maybe he got hit.  Maybe he's bleeding profusely in the cab.  Now he makes a huge swerve.  Watch this.  All right.  Here he goes.  Oh, he's trying to lose that load, man.  He's turning...  No, he's still going in the same direction.  I would have called a U-turn right there.  They got to shoot him.  Look at all the cops. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, they're going to...  They're going to shoot him.  This is a huge disaster waiting to happen.  They just got to shoot him.  They've had enough of his malarkey.  They're going to get an A-10 in or an Apache and blow him right out.  All they need is that shotgun through the door.  I don't know why they don't just...  Now he's really flying.  He's picked up speed.  Yeah.  All in some A.  This is in Dallas, Texas.  Is it Dallas?  Yeah.  I must say...  Dallas-Fort Worth.  Fox News rocks, man.  Hey, what are you going to expect?  They put that camera on the chases and you've got to love it. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, we've got Geraldo now, too, you guys know.  Yeah.  Well, of course.  We have to lock all our interns up.  That whore is going to go over to Afghanistan and try to catch Osama himself.  Right.  Hopefully, he'll be on TV.  Yeah.  A Fox exclusive.  Here he goes.  Still just on fire.  He's picking up speed.  And now he's moving, fanning the flames, as they say.  There you go.  That's a huge fire.  Here we go.  More stuff's falling off.  More stuff coming off of the air.  Yeah, there we go.  More wood falling off the back of it. 
[00:22:00]  Flaming the wood.  What a pro.  Oh, my God.  That is a huge fire on the back of that thing.  It's a forklift that's just dragging.  On fire.  This guy's got to be on drugs.  What a professional.  Oh, more stuff.  A big chunk of wood falling off.  He's really moving.  He's probably doing about 50 or 60 now.  The trailer itself is dragging the ass end of it.  He's probably got about 30 tons of wood on there, too.  The tire's long gone. 
[00:22:30]  Did he have his blinker on?  That's what started the fire.  Oh, he crosses over.  Oh, watch this.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  That was close.  All right.  That was close.  He's coming into another intersection.  He's on the other side of the road again.  Oh, and he makes a little weave back on the right side of the road.  Back on the right side.  Now he's obeying some traffic laws.  All right.  God, I love a good chase, man.  Now he's on the wrong side of the road again.  This one's great.  I don't understand why there aren't more cops around him. 
[00:23:00]  I don't know.  Because it's a flaming truck?  Yeah.  Yeah, after what we've seen in the recent months, this is nothing.  It's just a flaming truck.  Put the crossing guards on it.  Yes, let him do what he wants.  Who cares?  See what happens.  Now he's back in oncoming traffic.  He's going through an intersection.  Uh-oh.  We're losing the signal.  Come on.  Yeah, we got it back.  Okay, there we go.  Still just blazing on the back of that truck.  Well, I'll give you guys a ring when this all turns out.  This could be several hours. 
[00:23:30]  So sit back and enjoy.  Mark, if it does end in bloodshed that they edit out for the public, you must get us the  videotape unedited.  I'll do what I can do.  What is the protocol, man?  If they shoot this guy, they have a delay.  There's a delay.  They will not.  CNN's showing it live as well.  They won't show someone getting shot, though.  I know, because the last chase we won't.  Oh, crap.  They'll show his brain squirt out the back of the cab.  Are you kidding me?  This is not quite as good as the tank guy video, which was great. 
[00:24:00]  The guy that stole the tank.  Anthony, give him a chance.  He still has tons of wood left.  And now he's on the center median.  This could be it right here.  He's on the center median.  No, now he's back in the lane.  Trying to shake the wood.  Don't stop under that overpass.  I'll be present.  All right, I'll call you guys back if there's any more, you know, if they don't show the  execution.  All right.  Get back to the hell cam.  See you later.  As you can read about in the Star Ledger the other day.  That's right.  The whole story on Mark and the hell cam that Fox has zeroed in on Ground Zero. 
[00:24:30]  They did a little story on Mark.  We've got to stay with this story, Anthony.  I know.  I'm fascinated.  We're your news leader.  We've got to stay with this breaking story.  That's right.  Breaking news.  All right, now he's just tooling along here.  Yeah, he's picked up speed again.  He's in the correct lane, just trailing that burning forklift and lumber behind him.  Let's go to Rocky.  Rocky, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey, we're watching this damn police station.  I know. 
[00:25:00]  Yo, hey, guys, not to interrupt, man, but I can guarantee you this guy, I don't think  he's on drugs.  I think he's probably a schizophrenic.  After that move he just made, he's got to be on drugs.  Where is he going?  I've got to hang up.  I think this is it right here.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Look at all the cars.  There's going to be 20 or 30 patrol cars.  He turned off.  He made a hairpin turn that kind of really slowed him down.  And he's on a really...  Uh-oh.  Oh, this cop could head him off right here.  He's on a real small road now.  Why doesn't he get in front of...  Oh, he's got to be shooting at him. 
[00:25:30]  Zoom in with the cop there, goddammit.  I should be directing this.  Come on.  You're losing the shot.  That cop should have taken shots at him right there.  Now he's getting back on another main road there.  You know, when he's doing like 10 miles an hour around a hairpin turn, they should just  unload on the guy.  He's going to get out with a clipboard and go, delivery.  Look at him.  Delivery?  Can't be done.  Here he is.  There's a long way to go.  It's a short time to get there.  I'm Eastbound, just watch a bandit run. 
[00:26:00]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal.  Knocking down mailboxes.  Let it all hang out, cause we got a...  Bringing off flame and lumber and fuel tanks.  Stick in Atlanta.  And there's...  Got a girl in the car.  That's a man-ass.  I am Sheriff Frank.  You look a lot taller on the radio.  He's still touring along, man.  We've got a long way to go.  I'm a rose to get there. 
[00:26:30]  I'm Eastbound, just watch a bandit run.  All right, he's getting to another intersection here.  There he goes.  Well, he's got to get the course.  Oh, he's got...  That's a brave move right there.  Look at the smoke coming off of that load now.  Yeehaw!  It's just so hard to drop a load with an engine.  There he goes.  Oh!  Oh!  He came dreadfully close.  He is now weaving back and forth, trying to get rid of some of the load, I guess, again.  Man, I can't believe they can't stop this guy yet. 
[00:27:00]  The smoke really billowing out of the truck now.  The second that stops, by the way, and the wind stops on it, the thing will just be engulfed in smoke.  And fire.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Destroy!  Very busy intersection, but it looks like the cops have it stopped.  Look, right here, they could shoot him.  Why aren't they shooting him?  He drove right by a cop car.  What they say can't be done.  We've got a long way to go. 
[00:27:30]  And it's short.  All right, he's...  The goddamn German's got nothing to do with it!  It's not germane to the situation.  He's back on a main highway now.  He ain't gonna rest to you.  Hold my hat, Junior.  So you got the dog...  The flaming...  The flaming forklift.  Just put that hammer down.  It really is funny with the...  Smoking a bandit music.  Just watching it.  But...  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?  Bricker, breaker for a smoking report. 
[00:28:00]  And that girl looks like Bigger Little Enus.  Little Enus bet us we couldn't get Coors across the state line.  That's an attention getter.  He kicks the kid in the ass.  Hey, Bobby Bigrigger, what's up?  Hey, no way, what's going on?  If I can get this damn black sticker, I got this...  Hey, watch that.  I'm a little lumber.  Come on, get out of my way!  I got to get through it! 
[00:28:30]  Where's that damn station?  I need that sticker.  Oh, I...  He's copped a hat on me like crazy.  What the hell's going on here, man?  I get it.  You're calling us from Detroit.  Oh, I see.  Get out of my way!  I got to get through it!  Lacky bit.  Come on.  Oh, a whole bunch of wood.  You're left or right here, guys.  A whole bunch of wood.  Oh, no!  Oh, my God!  Holy S!  Now this guy should die.  The guy just skated past a short yellow school bus with lumber hanging off, just about impaling the bus on some of those two-by-fourses. 
[00:29:00]  Did you miss the bus or no?  No, I just missed it.  No, I just missed it.  Missed the chance to save taxpayers a lot of money.  A little-known fact, that bus was on its way to the Maury Popper Show.  The Maury Popper Show!  You're a special girl with a two-by-four in your head.  Wow, that was close, though.  That was really close.  The closest he came so far.  That was a good maneuver by the short bus.  Yeah, you got to give the driver that.  Got to give it a lot of credit.  Well, they're wearing their hockey helmets there, so I don't think they've got anything to worry about that. 
[00:29:30]  Still going.  Come on, Fox.  Zoom in on that.  There it is again.  Yeehaw!  How much fuel this guy got?  This could last for hours.  I don't want a break just in case it's over.  Back on the highway.  No cops around him, though.  They blocked off all the major intersections. 
[00:30:00]  Wow, look at that.  Through another intersection.  That's got to be interesting, being the first guy at that light and seeing that pass by you, you know?  Hey, it's a flaming semi.  How about it?  You don't see that every day.  Loaded up and trucking.  Are we going to do what they say can't be done?  We've got a long way to do it.  Alex got it.  Alex, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys? 
[00:30:30]  Hey.  Yeah, Ed, I think it's your mother-in-law.  All right, make a left.  I haven't made any left-hand turns.  What's wrong?  I just made right-hand turns to try to get the lomba off of my truck.  Another intersection.  Thanks.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Is there any truth to the rumor that this is actually Earl trying to get to another sticker  stop?  Earl trying to get to a sticker stop?  Because he's a little off.  It could be.  It could be.  Hey, guys.  Is the back of that still on fire?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:31:00]  I don't see as much smoke, though.  It's big time on fire.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, guys.  You're giving us the play-by-blay, and I don't believe it.  They're telling dick jokes on CNN.  Later, too.  All right, bro.  This is too good, though.  I love a good chase.  Now he's through another intersection.  Cops seem to have gotten to all these intersections.  I don't know how they're doing there.  Looks like more wood's going to fall off any second.  Jamie, what's up?  Yeah.  Hey, Opie.  You know this, dude.  I'm stuck behind every slow yenta on Long Island trying to get home to watch this. 
[00:31:30]  They're probably coming home from tennis lessons and sucking some yam bag and some tennis  instructor's mouth or something.  Jamie, I got to tell you.  This is one of the best police chases I've seen on Fox Live.  It's a good one.  It literally takes me 20 minutes to get home.  I've been on the road since quarter after three and listening to you.  I can't get past these people.  Right.  Get off the road.  All right.  There he goes through another one.  Cops at every one of these intersections.  But none next to him.  I guess it would be hard to get around his right-hand side when flaming lumber's falling 
[00:32:00]  off of it.  But the lumber's sticking straight out, too.  Yeah, the lumber is sticking across.  He's in the left lane, and the lumber is in the right lane.  Another piece of lumber just fell off.  Oh, he's getting off now.  He's getting off the highway.  He's getting off the highway.  He just took another off-ramp.  Another turn for him to handle.  And over a little overpass, which, again, would look really interesting if you're going  under that overpass going, hey, I wonder what that's all about.  See the flames just shooting out the back of this thing, though? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, it's really on fire, good.  Not smoking as much as it was, but it's burning more.  And on to another highway.  A lot of highways there in Texas.  By the way, this is a double trailer, too.  Yeah.  And the back trailer was filled with lumber.  That's all burnt off now.  Burnt or falling, or it's fallen off.  But the forklift that's on the back.  Is still on fire.  Is flaming pretty good.  Now he's on another.  Whoa, what was that?  Something else just, uh, that might have been a tire that he lost. 
[00:33:00]  More what?  Hmm.  They just said on CNN he is waving and honking the horn at people on the road.  Ah.  All right.  This is 15 minutes before they put a bullet in his head.  He's waving and honking.  Hey, what's all the attention I'm getting?  Right.  Like he doesn't even know.  No clue that's on fire.  I wish I could use the mirrors on this truck, but what the hell?  Hey, Sean, what's up?  Yo, I drive the same exact truck carrying lumber.  And even though all the tires are going in the back and he's just dragging steel, it doesn't matter. 
[00:33:30]  That truck can pull that no problem.  Oh, yeah.  At like 60 miles an hour until the fuel runs out.  Right.  Which you're talking about 10 hours.  Wow.  So if they decide to let him go into the desert and he gets away from the city, then they'll  bang him.  Right.  Well, let's see what happens.  I don't know.  I've seen...  I don't know.  I've seen...  I don't know.  You never know.  In another hour, you might see him get shot with a machine gun.  I've seen two instances so far where they could have stopped this guy.  Yeah.  Now he's getting...  He's on a highway where there are cars that he's approaching now.  I tell you, I guarantee his radio is up as loud as it could be. 
[00:34:00]  He's listening to some rock.  Oh, okay.  He's coming up to the right-hand side of a minivan or something.  Sean, I got to let you go.  We got Psycho Mark back on the line.  This is bad.  Psycho Mark.  This guy's good.  He is good.  What's he doing?  Look at him.  He's weaving into the cop.  He's swerving to get the cops off his tail.  Dude, he's just going bananas.  They've got to get an A-10.  Wow.  What was that?  They just rolled off the back.  Oh, something...  Whoa.  A big metal ball.  That looked like...  Could have been a ring.  Did you guys see him almost hit the short school bus?  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  That was classic.  I'm just going, watch this.  I bet he's going to run into a bus.  And then sure enough, the bus comes out of nowhere.  I'm going, oh, my God.  Here we go.  Some of that lumber was sticking out the side.  I thought it was going to go right through that bus.  All right.  We got cops slowly approaching on the right side.  Closer than I've seen them yet.  Now they're backing off again.  You've got to fall back.  Dude, you're going to just see an explosion from an F-15 from one of the Air Force bases down  there.  Oh, that would rock.  Wouldn't that be great seeing Apache come right over the hill?  You can only hope it's an F-Danny driving.  He's keeping the cops from getting around him by waving that flaming forklift in front 
[00:35:00]  of him.  Yeah.  Every time a cop approaches, he just swerves to get them off their tail.  Why don't you get these Fox helicopters and arm them?  You've got to just take them out.  Yeah.  That's what you need.  Yeah.  Bullets ricocheting and small children standing on the side of the street.  There he goes.  He's on another off ramp.  Yep.  Here we go.  Going around.  Coming back onto another highway.  The very, very wide open highways there in Texas.  Well, this looks like a busier road. 
[00:35:30]  We'll see.  A little busier.  Hey.  A few more cars.  I'd let him in.  I would let, like, usually I go, I've got to get past this truck because I don't want  to be behind him.  Look at the truck next to him.  Watch this.  Oh, I got this truck.  Oh, yes.  And this guy's going to go, hey, your load's on fire, sir.  I'm trying to help out.  Yeah, now he's on a road that's a little more busy.  There's another truck.  Oh, he just tried to put, watch this.  He's going to try and push him over.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  He's pushing over another tractor trailer. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, this is nuts.  Oh, boy.  Weaving a little.  Oh, watch this.  Oh, this is good.  Oh, God.  Okay.  It's really starting to weave.  He just took a swerve and the ass end of that truck just about clipped a vehicle on  the side of the road.  All right.  There's a cop right next to him.  Yeah, because he sees what he's doing now.  He's got to take this guy out.  Cops right next to him on his left.  You know, they do use this radios to tell truckers to block the roads up.  I've seen that happen.  If they could get a roadblock going where this guy really can't go anywhere. 
[00:36:30]  He's on a four-lane highway now.  Too bad they don't have any drawbridges down there, you know?  Using all lanes.  Although, he'd probably just cut across that median.  All right.  Cop making a move on the left.  All right.  Cop attempting to get up to him again.  Oh.  All right.  He's on the median.  Oh, here he comes.  Oh.  All right.  He just shut that cop down.  Yeah.  The cop had to slow down again and back off.  Oh, man.  Wow.  This guy's insane.  It's bucatee justice.  A blatant disrespect for the law.  Gene on Line 8 writes, this proves you don't have to plan for a radio show. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Well, you just got to hope some nut steals a tractor trailer.  Opie and Anthony show courtesy of Fox News today.  Oh, man.  I just, I want to see a thrilling conclusion to this.  Yeah, this show needs an ending.  Yeah.  Hopefully, if the guy has any nuts, he'll do something stupid.  See, we committed to this.  We can't leave until there's an ending now.  Look at the traffic on the other side.  They're slowing down to take a peek.  Uh-oh.  All right.  Now, I hear people over there in the delay going, ooh, wide open. 
[00:37:30]  One highway, two cops on his tail, one on the left side, one on the right.  They can't pass him, though.  Every time they try to pass him so far, he weaves over there and slides that flaming forklift over into their way.  Hey, Leo, what's up?  Oh, man.  How do you kill, how do you shoot a tractor trailer like that?  You just have to lead him a lot.  Yeah, you got to lead him a lot.  How do you shoot him?  You just don't lead him as much.  They can't get past him.  Every time they try, the guy swerves right into their way. 
[00:38:00]  Anthony, you know what he's got to do?  What?  One guy's going to go up the right side of him, get him over to one side of the highway,  and they're going to book around the other side of him.  Yeah, why don't they do that?  Exactly.  And then just, as you're driving by him, put the nine out the window and pump 12 rounds in his head.  No, you got to go with the shotgun with some slugs in it.  Oh, definitely.  The whole bed, all right, the whole bed, the wooden bed of that tractor, of the trailer part,  is burnt away halfway to the cab.  It's just a metal frame. 
[00:38:30]  I'm amazed he's still going.  Yeah.  Well, the fire doesn't look like it's burning as much right now.  I think...  The fire looks like it's just about out.  It's just smoldering.  Guys, we just got a close-up.  I think it's Dice.  He's trying to revitalize his career.  Hey, shut up.  They got a...  The cop looks like he's making a move on the left.  Right.  He's trying to get around.  No, he's holding him right now.  He's not sitting.  He's going to wait and make the move, you know?  They had him on that hairpin turn. 
[00:39:00]  Heidi Fleiss.  Yes.  Hey, what's up?  Oh.  What's happening?  Hey, Heidi Fleiss.  What's going on?  You guys are watching a car chase?  Yeah, we're watching a tractor trailer on fire in Dallas, Texas.  You're from L.A., right?  I'm from L.A.  Yeah, they got a lot of these chases in L.A., so it's like...  Oh, they're ridiculous.  You know what I think they should do when they have high-speed chases?  Let's take a rocket launcher and blow the car straight off the...  I like that.  I like that idea.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what it is, though?  For us, it's not that commonplace for us, so we still get thrilled about it. 
[00:39:30]  And this is a good one.  It's a tractor trailer flaming, and he's driving on the highway, and he's weaving in front of  cops and everything.  Pretty good.  We don't have open roads like this in New York, so you don't get to see this around here.  No, he'd be stuck in traffic.  Did you guys check out the one where someone took, I think, a tank off an army base?  Yeah, that was a good one.  That's Ann's favorite of all time.  One of my favorites.  You know which one was great out here was that shootout at the bank.  It was better than the scene in Heat.  That was a good one.  That was a good one.  Were you involved in that, Heidi? 
[00:40:00]  I was actually locked up at the time, but I watched it.  Locked up at the time for your shenanigans.  This truck driver is really trying to drop that load.  No offense.  Yeah, Heidi, that means something else when you're talking about trucking.  So what's going on, Heidi?  I'm promoting this DVD.  Oh, yeah?  Did you guys get a copy of it?  No.  What is it, a DVD of?  You're kidding me.  I hear you guys, Opie and Anthony, are hot shots.  Big, big hot shots. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, could you get us some hooas?  It sounds like you have no problem getting them on your own if you're as big as they say.  Nah, I don't know, from the likes of Charlie Sheen and stuff, I hear you've got some good ones.  Sex tips with Heidi Fleiss and Victoria Sellers?  Yes.  You're out of that business, Heidi?  Thank God, completely.  I can't hear.  Do you look back with fondness, though?  Oh, yeah, I have to admit, I loved every minute of it.  I'm not going to pretend.  You were in there.  You were a player with all the celebrities. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, I loved it.  I loved my job.  Sex and dope.  I was so pissed when I got arrested.  I mean, I felt like, God, I screwed up the best job on earth.  Yeah.  Hey, Heidi.  Boy, I live in large.  Heidi, can we guess what pills you're on today?  I'm on drug testing eight times a month.  Sounded a little out of it today.  Eight times a month?  They had me up.  I've been doing these interviews since 5 a.m.  Oh, yeah?  Wait a minute.  Eight times a month you're drug tested?  Eight times a month. 
[00:41:30]  That's a little strict.  You were just supplying some...  You were just giving some sex to people.  What the hell is the problem?  I don't know.  And they were consenting adults.  This guy in this tractor trailer is probably never drug tested.  And look at him.  He's the guy that needs it.  So what kind of sex tips there, Heidi?  Yeah, what do you got to offer?  The DVD is available on laugh.com.  And when you purchase it from laugh.com, you get a bonus autographed photo from myself. 
[00:42:00]  We don't know what the value is on that.  Hey, you want to sell a lot of these DVDs.  How about a Hummer?  Oh, my God.  We wouldn't sell any if we offered that.  You give the worst Hummers?  On Earth.  On Earth.  Why is that?  Teeth, right?  Some people just aren't good at certain things.  Hey, Heidi, let me let you in on a little secret.  Even a bad one is pretty good.  It's kind of like bad pizza.  Right.  It's still pretty good.  You know what I mean?  You know, you've had some really sensational ones.  But, you know, just contact mouth to whatever, and it's good already. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Heidi, what are you good at if you're not good at the Hummers?  I'm a business person.  She is a businesswoman.  She ran a very profitable business selling apples to celebrities.  Celebrities are a very small part of my clientele.  Celebrities are cheap.  Yeah, but you know something?  That's what put you on the map.  That's what put you on the map.  The celebrities.  Not the... 
[00:43:00]  You think so?  It was quartering the market.  Oh, you had everybody locked up?  All the rich people.  No, I don't mean to say it that way, but...  The rich people.  Yeah?  Like businessmen and executives?  The type that you read about in the Forbes or Fortune 500.  All right, so you...  And not these dot-comers, either.  I mean, real money.  Well, the dot-comers are gone.  Well, you got out of it just in time, because I don't think people are spending money that 
[00:43:30]  much on high-class whores.  How much would a very expensive or an average girl have cost for the night?  Well, in the DVD, I go...  Did you watch the end part of it where there's an intimate, a very candid conversation with  me?  Let's say yes.  Yeah, sure we did.  Yeah.  Well, okay.  We love the talking part of the DVD.  Well, the candid part, I give all the ins and outs of the business, and you really understand  how it works, and...  How much was your most expensive girl that you had in your stable of chicks? 
[00:44:00]  It doesn't work that way.  It does, too.  Okay, this is how it works.  A guy calls me up.  Heidi, I'm going to be in Vegas with some friends.  I need eight girls.  My name's Jim Norton.  Yeah.  So I send eight girls, say things are going well.  He tips a million bucks to be split up between the eight girls.  All right.  Hold the phone.  A million bucks to be divvied up between eight girls.  Yeah.  There ain't no slash in hell that is worth that much cash. 
[00:44:30]  Unless it's gold-plated.  Gold-plated.  Well, how long do they stay?  Gold-plated pooh-ha.  Well, that's what people don't understand.  These are the type of people that really don't have a concept of money.  Really?  And the money doesn't matter.  Huh.  Well, if somebody was a little broker, would you have, like, sent at least a deformed girl  over there that could have scrapped them?  Yeah, they have the yellow pages for that.  Some of your cheap girls.  Well, look at that.  And this is all in your DVD?  The DVD, the candid interview, I go all in the ins and outs of the hooker business.  You know, I hate to cut in, Heidi. 
[00:45:00]  That is a prime example of those a-holes that stay in the left lane and don't even look  in the goddamn mirror.  Because, you know something?  I come up on these people and I'm flashing my lights.  I'm beeping.  They don't get out of my way.  Here's a flaming goddamn tractor trailer.  They didn't even know it was behind them.  Get off the goddamn road, you prick.  They should have slammed them into the guardrail.  He finally looked in his rearview and went, oh, there's somebody behind me.  I can't believe it.  Get out of my way.  Sorry, Heidi.  Hey, Heidi, what was the most unusual request you guys got? 
[00:45:30]  I dealt with the high end.  I didn't have time for anything unusual.  Oh, come on.  Even the high enders get away.  No, the vice president arrested me.  I bragged on tape like an idiot.  I said, nothing tiki, condoms are a must, this, this, this.  Condoms are a must?  God, I hate that.  You know something?  For a million bucks and eight girls, I want A without a condom.  But look it, I wasn't the god of sex.  Maybe they didn't wear condoms.  I just could only give my, you know, opinion there. 
[00:46:00]  I got you.  Did you ever get involved in any of those sexual shenanigans?  There was something called a $40,000 a night fantasy night where I didn't disrobe, but I oversaw the whole thing.  Wait, wait.  For $40,000?  Heidi, you were there, and what did you do?  It was, uh, that guy Nick Broomfield made a documentary about me called Hollywood Madam, and I talk about it.  Yeah, but Heidi, you don't, but you can talk about it right here.  You don't have a $40,000 body.  This is what I did. 
[00:46:30]  Uh, excuse me?  What?  I'm not, hey, I didn't disrobe.  I know, but you're not worth $40,000.  So what would you do?  No, I'm not worth $40,000.  Are you kidding?  I'm lucky if I could get a date.  So, so you'd send girls over.  You would be there also?  I would, uh, I would whisper in the ear little fantasy things.  He used to be in love with a couple of these girls, and he would like to hear stories.  Like, I, I sent her on a trip, and she misbehaved and had to have sex with the whole crew.  Oh, I like that one.  So, it was all, it was definitely, it was called Fantasy Night, because I'd make up these crazy fantasies. 
[00:47:00]  Right.  So you would, uh, how many girls were involved?  Just one other girl?  No, I would bring, uh, his favorite one, and then when she got tired, a backup, and then as evening went on, a couple other ones, and then a couple relievers.  I only stayed for two hours.  I like that.  She has relievers that come in at the end.  The cleanup girls.  And, you know, you can purchase these also at Virgin Megastores and Tower, um,  records, and, um, also on Laugh.com, they send, uh, sell other people like John Valby and, uh, Jerky Boys. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, we know that.  We know those guys.  That's where you want your sex tapes.  You know those guys?  Laugh.com.  Hey, hi.  Laugh.com.  Heidi.  Yes.  Give us one sex tip.  Buy women gifts.  Buy women gifts.  That's a sex tip?  That's a gift.  Hey, ho, hey, ho, ho, ho.  Say, say Hummer next time.  Yeah, we can't, we can't use that descriptive term.  So, if you want a good Hummer, you buy her something.  Yeah. 
[00:48:00]  You know what else works for that?  Well, that doesn't mean anything, you know.  You know what else works for that?  A handgun.  A handgun?  Yeah, you're probably, yeah, that's right.  It's just some kind of, uh, something forcible.  Hey, Heidi, you have any of that, um, Linda Blair chained, caged heat sex in, uh, prison?  Well, um, I was, uh, in prison, uh, I had to compromise myself a couple of times.  You did?  Oh, let's hear about that.  Yeah, come on.  Well, it only happened, right when I got there, uh, I knew it was, it's like throwing that 
[00:48:30]  Jennifer Lopez to her fans, you know?  Oh, it was like a, uh, what?  They were waiting for me.  Who was it?  Who did you?  I got there at this prison camp I was sent to.  Prison camp.  I like it.  Yeah, camp.  Like, they call it club fed.  Like, it's really some, you know.  No bras allowed.  I like it.  And I get there, and I'm being escorted around.  All of a sudden, I'm surrounded by about 10 or 15 bull dykes.  Yeah, bull dykes. 
[00:49:00]  I mean, they look like men.  Ugh.  Hold on, hold on.  The truck is stopping.  Wait a minute, Heidi.  Hold on, Heidi.  That's very important, but I got to see what happens here.  Yeah, we'll get back to your interview in a second.  The truck has stopped.  We're psychomarking when we need them.  They zoomed up.  The guy's getting out of the truck.  That's it?  Did he get out?  Is he on the ground?  Is he on the...  Oh, my God.  Oh, and the cops are on top of him.  That...  Son of a bitch.  That's a stupid ending.  That is the dumbest ending for a story I've ever seen.  That's the worst ending.  He didn't have a sign on him or anything?  Nothing.  They should have shot him anyway, just on principle. 
[00:49:30]  Look at that guy with his automatic weapon drawn.  He's so bummed.  He's like, why didn't the guy start running?  That's like cutting away from the facial on Spice Channel.  Right.  When they're going out of the hotel sex channel, they cut out the money shot.  I was going to say, Heidi, you can relate.  No money shot.  No.  No money shot.  I hate that.  All right.  Well, he's been apprehended.  He gave up.  They shouldn't let him give up after a certain time.  No, I agree.  Definitely some violence must take place at the end of these things.  Ah, that sucks. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, wow.  Well, Heidi, okay, so the bull dykes, 10 or 15 bull dykes?  They surrounded me.  Yeah.  And they're offering me things like that you need in prison that I didn't know about.  Like protection?  No, they were saying, do you need sweatpants?  Do you need coffee?  Do you need...  All right.  And really, prison is lesbian hell.  Lesbian hell.  Lesbian hell.  Well, if you're gay, it's lesbian heaven.  So what did they do to you?  Well, I selected one.  She looked like a little surfer boy. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  And I never serviced her or anything of the sort.  Oh, really?  Never.  But she would service you?  Yeah.  Oh.  Ooh, yeah.  Front and back?  What the?  No, no, no.  I like mine with syrup.  And at a prison camp, there's no locked doors anywhere, so you have to go to sneaky places.  Oh.  I just picture in the middle of the night, Heidi's door opens up, right, because there's no locked doors.  All of a sudden, that bull dyke comes in, just puts your prison, pulls up your prison dress, that blue prison dress, and just dives in head first. 
[00:51:00]  Right?  I don't care if it's right.  Just say yes.  She was pretty good.  She was good at what she was doing.  Of course, she's a bull dyke.  Just do it.  All right.  Hopefully, I never see her again in life, though.  Well, just stay out of jail.  Keep your nose clean.  Absolutely.  There you go.  Heidi, again, you have a DVD.  What's it called?  Well, sex tips, and buy it off laugh.com, if you get the special autographed photo. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  And it's also available at the Virgin Megastores and Tower Video, wherever VHSs and DVDs are sold.  Mm-hmm.  And it's a great Christmas gift, especially.  Oh, of course.  I'm going to get it for my grandma.  Yeah.  Believe it or not, we answer emails, and some couples in their 80s emailed us for sex advice.  Same ones you see in the swinger magazines, with the left-tilted junk and the boobs hanging down to their knees. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, that really gets you wound up.  Yeah, Heidi.  All right, Heidi.  Thank you for checking in with us today.  All right.  I hope you enjoy another car chase.  Yes, they do rule.  Yeah, that was a good car chase.  All right.  Take it easy.  Goodbye, Ms. Fleiss.  Bye-bye.  We love you.  Thank you.  All right.  You're welcome.  We got audio from the driver of the truck already?  Yeah.  Hey, Dave, you said this was going to give me some publicity.  Hey, the cops are on me, Dave.  What do I do? 
[00:52:30]  Dave, Dave, the forklift exploded, Dave.  I think I'm in trouble.  You said this was going to work, and what happened to Pete Opie and Anthony here in Boston?  Now, Dave, they're shooting at me.  Dave, Dave, Dave, you son of a bitch.  They're shooting at me.  Wow.  Could it have been?  You never know.  Oh, well, we should take a break, huh?  Yeah.  We need one now.  That was pretty surreal.  We're watching a cop chase, and then Heidi Fleiss calls us. 
[00:53:00]  Heidi Fleiss calls us.  Watching fiery Chuck chase while playing Smoke and Abound, a theme always funny.  That's from Crinkle Crinkle.  You bastard.  That's good.  All right.  We'll take a quick break, Anthony.  Yes.  When we come back, Steve Lynch's new song that he debuted yesterday on our show.  Right.  Just in case you missed it.  Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One day to go.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[00:53:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love that.  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  I like that woman just took a shirt off.  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  Show us.  Show us.  And find me.  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday! 
[00:54:00]  Oh, that's fantastic!  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday!  I can't see your appointment!  It's Whipple Mal Wednesday!  Stay out the bushes.  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday. 
[00:54:30]  It's Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show on this fine Whip-A-Mow Wednesday.  Very easy concept.  You write WOW on the back of your car or get one of the WOW bumper stickers.  And if the ladies feel like it, they'll flash it on the way home from work.  That's right.  And in WOW News in Boston today, Anthony?  Yeah.  WBCN will be at Guitar Center on Com Ave near Boston University from 5 to 7 today. 
[00:55:00]  BCN giving away WOW bus cards, WOW bumper stickers, and WOW T-shirts.  Megaphone Matt will be there giving away a trip for two to attend the WWF Pay-Per-View Survivor Series in North Carolina on Sunday, November 18th.  So starting at 5 today, go to Guitar Center on Com Ave near Boston University, all right?  Right.  You know, we were just watching a great car chase on TV, tractor trailer on fire, being chased by the cops all over Texas.  Ended a little anticlimactically with the guy just getting out of the truck. 
[00:55:30]  We spent a lot of valuable time on that car chase, assuming that it would have been a great ending.  But it reminded me of one I saw yesterday on Fox.  I'm not sure if it was a clip of an older one.  I think it had just recently happened, though.  Guy got out of the vehicle to give up, put his hands on his head, laid down, and the car kept rolling.  And it ran his legs over, and it was the funniest goddamn thing.  He gets out, puts his hands on his head, lays down like everything's fine, and the car rolled over his legs. 
[00:56:00]  I just, I want someone to get hurt.  That's what I want at these things.  Someone to get hurt.  Man, they had their automatic weapons drawn and everything.  They took shots at the guy.  They were ready to go.  Ready to kill him.  Gary!  Yeah.  What's up, bro?  Talk about whipping out Wednesdays.  Wow.  Yeah.  I must say, I would have liked it, you know, better.  Like, that guy got out and saw him make a run for it.  Are you on the Ritalin today?  Nah.  A little of the Ritalin? 
[00:56:30]  Nah, I would like him to make a run for it.  I'd call him to blow up.  Well, that wasn't good enough for you, Gary?  I mean, the damn thing was on fire.  Things have fallen off it.  Balls of flames rolling down the highway.  Oh, it was great.  I admit, I like the fire.  Yeah.  But I didn't even know what that circle thing was.  An orb that went flying off the car.  What was that?  By a tire.  Yeah, it looked like a rim.  It had been a rim.  I know earlier it was a piece of the forklift.  Yeah.  I was watching it.  I was like, that's a fireball or something. 
[00:57:00]  That's not even a part of the car.  Like a fireball.  Someone's actually on the phone saying that that was a good thing.  Where?  What's that?  Where are we going?  Something about the forklift being on the back of the truck?  Hey, hello.  Water doodles.  No wonder they dragged them behind trucks.  It's so if they fall apart in flames, he can get away.  Stupid forklifts.  No wonder they dragged them behind trucks.  Water doodles.  Pilegize.  Sorry, Gary. 
[00:57:30]  Be back with more of the Greaseman Show.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  I just wanted to say.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Today is a wow.  I just wanted to say my father will call up.  Okay.  Gary.  Yeah.  Now, you did pay attention to what we said, and you weren't on any other shows, were you?  Nope.  I called up on Fez, and they didn't take it well.  No.  You know, I heard it on the Ron and Fez show after us here in New York, and you did the  right thing.  You told those guys to get lost.  Very good, Gary. 
[00:58:00]  You're welcome.  Hey, Gary.  What do you mean you're going to hang out and meet a girl and pull a train?  Oh, God.  I want to pull a train with Gary.  What do you mean?  He's a classic.  I like Gary very much.  I want me and him to tag team a chick.  Oh, my God.  I thought maybe you meant an electric train, some kind of a young child-like thing.  No, no, not a gay thing.  I mean, but with a girl.  Me and him with a girl.  Let's slow down with Gary.  I already got a girlfriend.  I'm already settled down.  Oh, all right.  There you go.  Maybe not. 
[00:58:30]  I'm still a player.  No, I might lose.  I may not.  Wait, you're a player.  I'm a player.  You have a girlfriend?  If I get caught.  Learned from your dad, did you?  No, I'll just be called a loser.  If I get caught.  You're a player.  So, what's your girlfriend's name, Gary?  Tiffany.  Italian.  Italian.  I have another one.  Yeah.  Don't be messing.  Please, God.  Don't be messing.  I have another one, Samantha.  Spanish Harlem one.  Spanish Harlem chick.  Nice. 
[00:59:00]  They go.  They're goers.  That's good.  I can't stand her.  Like, she was in my class.  Yeah.  I used to, like, say something, like,  snabby.  She's like, what the hell is that supposed to mean?  I'm like, not in a weird way.  I was just saying something.  She got snabby.  Like, what's that supposed to mean?  That diss to me?  I'm like, whoa.  So, that's why I dumped her.  And that's what I'm saying with Tiffany.  Which dumped her?  The Spanish Harlem chick gave you too much lip, is what you're saying.  Too much lip, and I had enough of her.  Yeah.  You got jungle fever, Gary?  A little bit.  Yeah? 
[00:59:30]  That's good.  See, the kids all get along.  You like the Italian broads, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's not what I mean by jungle fever, Opie.  Huh?  The Sicilian fever.  How old is she, Gary?  Huh?  How old is she, the Sicilian chick?  Twenty-seven.  Huh?  Thirteen.  Thirteen.  Old or broad.  Nice.  Thirteen.  Cheerleader, too.  Cheerleader.  Why is...  Now, wait a minute.  I'm a little concerned that a 13-year-old girl is hanging out with an 11-year-old boy.  Calm down.  Gary.  Gary, I'm just showing a little concern.  I think it's maybe a little too early for you to be hanging out with a girl that age. 
[01:00:00]  I don't know.  What grade is she in?  Like, seventh or so?  Seventh.  And what are you in?  I'm in sixth.  Sixth?  Hey, Gary.  You're in sixth grade?  Is she tight?  Hey, God.  I want to say that she's listening.  Eek.  I want to say it because if she's listening, I'm dead.  Right.  I go to her house, I'm getting like five slaps in my mouth.  Well, right. 
[01:00:30]  There you go.  Does your mom approve of this, Liddy?  I don't live with my mom.  He lives with his dad.  I didn't know you were divorced parents.  They're not divorced.  They're separated.  Separated.  There you go.  They're going to get divorced.  Oh, and I just want to say my dad's fault.  She's nice, Opie.  Hey, what happened in the marriage there?  Oh, for the...  I don't want to say.  Yeah.  But my mom wasn't in there.  Don't make him go into that.  Albeit just to say that it was his fault.  My fault.  Your fault. 
[01:01:00]  Who would you rather live with, your mom or your dad?  My dad.  Your dad?  Yeah.  Why?  Because my dad's cool.  Yeah.  I'm sure your mom's cool, too.  They get you cool presents and stuff?  No.  You know, once women get married...  I learned this from my dad.  Once women get married, they don't settle down.  They go haywire.  That's what my mom is.  They go haywire?  Yeah.  In what way?  You mean they don't like hanging out with...  Cuckoo, cuckoo.  They go cuckoo? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  You've got to give us an example.  Say, like...  Say, like, you go crazy.  Right?  Yeah.  Say, like, I go crazy.  Yeah.  That's what my mom would do.  Oh.  So she went crazy.  She doesn't keep her cool, as I must say.  Oh.  I just want to say, that guy, Chocolate, or some chocolate...  Some chocolate?  Who was that guy that called it?  Big Chocolate.  Big Chocolate.  Big Chocolate?  Yeah.  I think he's better than him.  I mean, anybody's better than him.  I don't even know how to lie, but I'm better than him. 
[01:02:00]  All right, Carrie.  All right, guys.  So your mom yells a lot at your dad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And my dad's not living with her anymore.  What?  And your dad what?  My dad's not living with her anymore.  Yeah, I know.  You told us that.  Your dad knows that you listen to these shows and call these shows?  He doesn't approve of them, but he approves of them.  Like, both, both.  He's not a fan, necessarily, but he doesn't mind you listening, because he knows it's harmless.  Hey, we have a friend of Gary's father in line.  If we can put him on hold.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Who's Joe?  No, my father's friend.  Oh, they just hung up, though.  They hang up.  All right.  All right, well, Gary, we're going to let you go, all right?  Yeah.  Who's in the background?  That's my parents.  Your what?  That's one of my friends here.  All right?  Bye.  All right, bye, Gary.  A very mysterious boy.  Yeah.  He's a cool kid.  A very mysterious young lad.  He's a player.  I just like Gary.  He's cool, man.  He's like an adult.  He's a player. 
[01:03:00]  All right, we promised a brand new Stephen Lynch song.  Stephen Lynch came in yesterday to debut his latest song, Anthony.  Oh, he's pumping them out now.  And getting them new songs out.  And did a solo for this song.  He asked me to help out.  I never heard the song, but I had to play my little slide whistle flute thing to it.  Well, he needed you.  Yeah, and I was right there to jam.  Oh, by the way, Robin Leach coming in today in a little while.  Nice.  But Stephen Lynch is playing Governors tonight in Levittown.  We highly recommend you go see him if you're in the area, okay? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  And here's his latest song, Down to the Old Pub.  This is an old traditional Irish song, and it's usually passed down from father to son  when the boy's on the verge of manhood.  And it's called Down to the Old Pub Instead.  Ah.  And I'd like to play it for you tonight.  That it's your duty to find your lass with childbearing hips in a pink suple lass 
[01:04:00]  And make her your wife and lover with love so true  Now some rivers run high, some rivers run low  When her river runs red, then she's starting her flow  And it's called menstruation  Here's what it means to you  You will notice her bloomers are spotty at first  Stand back, her ovarian dam's gonna burst  Son, don't be afraid, it's a natural thing 
[01:04:30]  Just wad up some cotton in hand or a string  And put the old linens on top of the bed  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead  Hundreds of years old  That's why bloomers  Aye  Aye  She'll retain her water, her breasts will be tender  Say something nice and you're sure to offend her  Get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead  She'll want to make love if you do 
[01:05:00]  You're a fool, you'll only end up with a bloody old tool  Now get out of the house, go down to the old pub instead  Here she'll want you to sample the fruit of her loins  But son, it'll taste like some old rusty coins  So turn off the light and take off your hat and drop to your knees  Say a prayer to St. Pat that'll give you the strength to get out of the bed  And for Ireland's sake, go down to the old pub instead  I feel a solo coming on 
[01:05:30]  Perhaps right here, Anthony  Very good  Now the pub is the place where the lads are a-meeting  When the moon is full and the gals are a-bleeding  The Catholic, the Protestant, even the pig in the pub is the place  When your lady is ragging  So drink of your pint, boys, and thank your Samrocks  That as menfolk we don't have to bleed from our c*** 
[01:06:00]  And that we can escape from the lady in red  And get out of the house and go down to the old pub instead  Down to the old pub instead  Nice!  Thank you, my lads!  Thank you so much!  Raise your glass!  Funny good!  You did your part well!  Thank you!  Nice fluting!  Nice fluting and nice bleeping! 
[01:06:30]  I was a fluter and bleeper, yeah!  Let them hang  Let them hang like the animals they are  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show  Wide open phone lines  We just got rid of everyone during those commercials  In the New York area 
[01:07:00]  877-692-1027  Anywhere else  867  Excuse me  866  866-277-4-WOW  866-277-4-WOW  Scott, what's going on today?  Oh, hey, dude  I just wondered who the douchebag was  That was blowing on that meat whistle during the last bit  Meat whistle?  That was Anthony  What?  I...  You sound like a real pro 
[01:07:30]  Maybe you were taking some lessons from Heidi Flight  She says she's bad at it  Yeah  Anthony did it off the cuff  He didn't know Stephen Lynch needed a little solo  Maybe she offers lessons  Alright, Scott, thank you  Hey, calling from Cleveland  You guys suck  Right on, bro  Thank you  Let's go to Derek  Derek, what's up?  The American Red Cross  You guys got to say something about them being on trial  They squandered all the money from the disaster relief fund 
[01:08:00]  What is this squandered?  Well, about $121 million of the money that they collected  Which was $564 million  Got sent to the families  The rest of it is going out to, like, blood banks and stuff  We weren't even donating for  Yeah, well, here's the problem  When we were all told to donate to the Red Cross  Right  They failed to tell us that not all the money will be going to the victims of 9-11  It will be going to the Red Cross  The Red Cross  And what they do  The Red Cross  And then they'll decide how much of the money will go to the victims 
[01:08:30]  It turns out only 20% of the money that they collected since 9-11  Is going to the victims  It's complete BS  I'm so pissed off that I didn't give any money to it  Wow, yeah  And 80% will be going toward all the other, you know, causes that they helped  So they made out on this disaster  They mentioned about how half of it's going to go to future causes  That might come down from, you know, people getting infected from whatever it sees  And stuff like that  Stuff we didn't even think about at the time when we were given the money  We, like, wanted the money to go directly to families and stuff 
[01:09:00]  Well, they should have told us that, obviously  Well, they claim they had a little disclaimer on all of their ads  And on their, you know, commercials on TVs and stuff  No, they didn't  That's what they're saying  That woman that comes on in the middle of the night  That Red Cross woman  If the image is disturbed, you turn away  I don't know  I mean, I don't think that there's  Well, no, I don't think they're doing that  But I think it was a little odd that they didn't really put it up front  That, all right, you're giving us money  But remember now, half of this money, or 80% of it 
[01:09:30]  Isn't going to go to the cause that you're giving to right now  Yeah, they deceived us, really  All right, Derek  All right, thanks, bye  Bye  Just, I don't know  It seems like we should have just gotten a list of the people that were in the building  And mailed a check to their family, you know  Hey, here you go  I'll just tide you over for a little bit  George Clooney pissed off at all  As all hell at Bill O'Reilly  The O'Reilly Factor  On Fox  I love the O'Reilly Factor  Gak, gak, gak 
[01:10:00]  Love the O'Reilly Factor  If I see George Clooney  I'm going to punch him in the face  He's nothing but a faggot  Yeah, he's pissed  Because O'Reilly's been talking about this for a while  All this money that's gone to the Red Cross  The September 11th fund  No one's really keeping track of where it's going  How much is coming in  And how much is going out  And where it's going  And these celebrities  That have been raising money for this  It doesn't really seem that they care where it's going 
[01:10:30]  As long as they came across looking good  Raising this money  But they have no clue either  They were told to, you know  Put their mugs on TV  And help us raise some money  Exactly  It's not as ominous as Bill O'Reilly  Tries to make it out to be  He's like  He'll take any issue  Why then did you decide to put the toilet paper on  Going over the top  Over the falls method  When we know that's a communist way to do things  Bill, it's just toilet paper on the moon  Oh, stop it now  That's an excuse 
[01:11:00]  It's just a few Jews too, right?  He'll make the most inane thing  Seem like this huge, huge issue  That's why I love the guy  You need a guy like that on the television  I love the guy  Because he's just got a set of ballies on him  Remember that show  Every so often a show like this comes around  Remember the show Crossfire  Of course  Where they just had those two pricks on there  Battling back and forth  Oh, you're a jackass  And they're screaming at each other  I eat that stuff up  Love it  So when Bill O'Reilly's ragging 
[01:11:30]  About George Clooney  And then George Clooney responds  In a letter  I love it  Can't get enough of it  But George is really pissed off  Saying that  Hey  We did this  Because we cared  And it wasn't just to get our faces out there  Pretty much  But O'Reilly's got a point  Do you know where that money went?  When you write that check  I don't know  I don't know where it went  And I know a few of those celebrities  Could give a crap  They were out there 
[01:12:00]  Just to get their faces out there  Sure  We just all assumed  You know  Our money would go directly to the families  Yeah  I don't think there was a fund  Just directly for that  Which there should have been  I don't think the Red Cross  Should be under false pretenses  Pretenseses  I don't think they should  Be taking that much of the money  Right  For their own  Causes  Lady Di  Yeah hi  How you doing guys?  How are you?  How are you? 
[01:12:30]  I knew you were going to say that Anthony  Oh why  Hey Jim  Why Di  Hi Jim  Hi  Hi ONA  Hi  Hi Ben  Hi Rick  Hi  Shut up  Hi everybody  It's Lady Kreskin  Okay  I knew you were going to say it  You know what happened was  I was at Smackdown last night  Oh yeah  You should have been Smackdown last night  Really  Someone smacked you down last night  Smackdown in Jersey  Of course Lady Di  Were you wearing overalls  And did you have a beard?  No  Took your son to Smackdown 
[01:13:00]  Small consolation  And there was a lot of ONA signs over there  That's what I wanted to let you know  How are you?  How are you?  Aaron says hi too  Did you see that one sign that said  Fall on a knife  Fatso?  No I did not see that sign  Be nice Jim  Will ya?  Oh stop it  Will ya?  Yeah please  Will ya?  Will ya?  Will ya?  Yes  But I wanted to let you know  And when I get the pictures  Thank you  Thank you so much  Scorch  What's up?  Hey Scorch 
[01:13:30]  What's going on?  From Syracuse  K-Rock Syracuse  What's going on boys?  What's the new name of the show again?  The Kingdom of Nakedness  It is definitely that  No you were changing yourself  Yeah but you know what  I took your advice  I was thinking about it  And I realized you're right  What did you want to call the show?  It was  We were starting to call it Club Naked  And then I started thinking  You know what  As I heard you say  Gay, gay, gay  I'm thinking  Yeah you know  It might be  Club Naked  Welcome to Club Naked  So we are actually  We have the Kingdom of Naked  Glory holes in all the bathrooms 
[01:14:00]  At Club Naked  I love Naked  Gary Goldstein's Club Naked  So what's going on Scorch?  Not much man  We're just  My Scorch1.com webpage  Should be up next week  Scorch1.com  I can't wait  Believe it or not  We're going to have like  A streaming  There's your dog bark  Your token dog bark  It's going to have a  Studio cam  Streaming studio cam  Oh  So you'll be able to see  What me and my  My hot sidekick look like 
[01:14:30]  Something we can't even  Get here for some reason  I'm not getting it  Through the station  So don't feel bad  I'm going  With all the appearance  You're making on our show  Any PD's calling you  From larger markets?  Yeah  You know what  Not necessarily  But I'm actually  Thinking about doing  What you said  I'm going to send you guys  A tape so you can  Play it in the show  I heard that somebody  On your show  A friend of mine  That worked here  Heard you guys in Philly  And I guess  Was there a girl  That got her hair cut  Like mine?  Yeah  A girl shaved her head  For U2 tickets 
[01:15:00]  Stalker Patty  Yes  What a waste  For U2 tickets?  Yeah  For U2 tickets  Oh my gosh  So what are you doing  On the Kingdom of Nakedness  Tomorrow?  What do we get tomorrow?  Leah  Somebody from VIP  So I get to talk to her  About a few things  And we're going to start  Talking about this  Marathon for meals  I'm doing for the  Homeless and hungry people  I'm staying in a  Shopping mall  In a camper  You're in radio hell  Remember I did that  Before the last  I've done  This is like the  Fifth one of these  I've done  Hold the phone  You're in radio  We've got to get you 
[01:15:30]  Out of Syracuse  Get me out of here  I don't mind  Doing it though  Because it's very good  Let me guess  You're going to be there  For over 24 hours  Collecting food right?  I'll be there  For probably 10 days  Scorchers club  Crinkle crinkle  And what else  Is going on?  Wait wait wait  Slow down  We've got to talk  About that  Let's talk about this  Shall we?  Why don't you just  Get the big  Semi truck  And you've got to  Broadcast until they  Fill it up  Hey just stay on a  Billboard  That's what it is man  Oh that's what you're doing? 
[01:16:00]  Yeah pretty much  So it'll be in the  Parking lot of the  I live  I have an RV  That I live in  Oh my god  You have an RV  You live in?  Yeah and then there's  A tractor trailer truck  That would fill up with food  With food  Alright  For the homeless  And the hungry  And you've got to  Stay there until the  Whole tractor trailer  Is filled with food  Yeah or until we  Jimmy rig it  So it looks like  It's fully the way  Christ  Oh man  I mean look  It's for a good cause  I have no problem  With that  Yeah it's for a good cause  To tell you the truth  Can I be honest with you  Keep me from having to  Walk my god damn  Pain in the ass  Dogs  But they've been doing 
[01:16:30]  That radio bit  Since like the early  70s  Sure but look at it  There's no program  Directors out there  That can't figure out  A new way to raise  Money around the holiday  I've been doing it  Since the early 70s  Myself for crying out loud  We came up with a  Great idea but for some  Reason the lawyers  Will not let us  Are you talking about  The fields for meals  Fields for meals  I think you know what  Once again we will  Try to do fields for meals  On the Opie and Anthony  Show  Every year we try  Last year was the  Closest we got  We were almost there  We had the boxes made  We test run it 
[01:17:00]  We tested the women  And we were ready to go  You want to explain  Fields for meals  Real fast  Fields for meals  Is a great great concept  It helps everybody  Involved and it raises  Money yet we have not  Been able to try this  Out only in theory  But we know it would  Work and we have a  New mayor in New York  City so maybe we can  Get this past  Yeah it would  Definitely work  It would be huge  I mean I've told  More people about  Fields for meals  You know how to do  It's good  What we do  Let me explain  Fields for meals  To everybody out there 
[01:17:30]  We get a few boxes  Huge refrigerator boxes  We stand them up  We cut two holes in them  About breast level  To a woman  And we fill the box  With a woman  Now guys line up  For miles  For blocks  And pay money  Which goes to  Feeding the homeless  For the holidays  To reach into said box  And cop a feel  From the topless girl  Inside the box  Feels for meals 
[01:18:00]  The guys get feels  The homeless get meals  And for some reason  This would be the  Hugest thing  Think about the money  That we can raise  And now that we're  Syndicated we could have  A box in every city  A box in every city  Yeah  Every man's dream  And for some reason  The lawyers tell us  That we can't do this  They bring up some  Wacky word like  Prostitution  Oh please  Press aren't  Officially sex organs  No it's  You're reaching in  And you're reaching out  How about the 
[01:18:30]  Brother daughter team  Last year  Was that fabulous  We had a girl  That wanted to do  The feels for meals  We had the box  In here in the studio  We wanted to test it out  Her brother was with her  We put her in the box  And a bunch of guys  Started feeling her  Through the box  One at a time  And one of the guys  Online  Her own brother  And she had to figure out  Which one was the brother  Which one  Were her own brother's hands  Blood brother  I think she won  Jim Brewer tickets for that  Out here  In central New York  That's like commonplace  So that's not even  A contest here 
[01:19:00]  Yeah  Well I don't know  We're allowed to I guess  Do feels for meals  In the studio  For some reason  But we can't take it out  On the streets yet  I think that's  One of the best radio ideas  That's just one of the best ideas  I've told more people  About feels for meals  When you guys told me  About that last year  I can't believe  It was last year  That we actually started  Talking about stuff  It's no douche or dressing  But we're hoping  It's no douche or dressing  You know what's actually  Gone over extremely well  Has been bush or pussy  Well you better explain it  Before they dump out  It has nothing to do with 
[01:19:30]  You know what  Yeah no no no no  What I do is actually  I change it a bit  I come up with a scientific name  The Latin name  Of either a bush  Or a cat  And I take  Two people on the line  Or four people  Teams of two  And I let them play off  Against each other  And we give  Virtually nothing  Because I have nothing to give  But it's just something  That works out well  Up here  So anyway  That's what's going on  I've got  I've got  George Foreman  I'm working on  I'm working on  Kiefer Sutherland  Coming in in a couple weeks  Oh really  Big star now 
[01:20:00]  With that TV series  24  Yep  And there's my dog  Again  That's cool  I've got the videotape  Of the thing we did  Remember I told you  I was doing a  Dinner and a movie thing  Yeah  Came out extremely well  They left everything in  They did it unedited  I couldn't believe it  Well I want to see this  You're going to set a tape right  Yeah we're going to  Ship it off to you  I'm looking at pictures  Of Scorch  Is that really a picture  Of you with Elton John  That's me and Elton John  In Las Vegas  He's a faggot  You ran into Elton John  In Vegas huh  Yeah I ran into Elton John  In Vegas

[01:24:00]  From across the world  All making tons of money here  In the business called  Entertainment  Very good  I hated that show  Yeah  That was a show  Well that's because we never came to your house  And looking at you now  We never will  Exactly  It was like lifestyle  The hovels  Look at all the things  Hovels  I'll never have  Lifestyles of the twisted and demented  Lifestyles of the torn and broken down  Lifestyles of the broke 
[01:24:30]  Yeah  Hovels of the broke  See people  Everybody thinks that there's tons of money to be made in radio  Yeah  But I know  There is none  See  You're right  I'm getting paid zippo  For this starring appearance  Nothing  For which I was kept 25 minutes late waiting  Look at Opie's furniture  Costing him the tens of dollars  I'm so rich  I have people wait for me  You're on Broadway now  Take back control of your show guys  Yes  Yes 
[01:25:00]  Oh we've got it  We have it  So you're on Broadway now Robin  Yes  Doing what  I opened last night in the Rocky Horror Show  Oh wow  At the Circle in the Square Theatre on West 50th  Just a little west of Broadway  Who are you Frankie  No  I'm not the mad scientist who makes the young boy for his own pleasure  No  Are you Riff Raff  But  What's that  Are you Riff Raff  No I'm not Riff Raff  No I'm not Riff Raff  Because I can't sing like Sebastian Bach  Doing the Time Warp  No they made me dance the Time Warp last night  Did they  They made me sing  I only missed one musical cue 
[01:25:30]  What were you singing  There are songs that the narrator sings  You know I stepped into the shoes of Dick Cavett  On Broadway  Oh Dick Cavett  Yes  He's gone away for 10 weeks  Yeah  And I'm the first replacement  And then Gilbert Gottfried is the next replacement  Gilbert is the  And then Jerry Springer is coming in  And then in a classic ultimate piece of casting  Yeah  Penn and Teller  One of them doesn't talk  Right  So how he can narrate is beyond me  He can't be a narrator 
[01:26:00]  No  Or narrator  Narrator  Narrator  I like that  Narrator  So English  We saw you two years ago  Yes where was I  You blew us off Robin  Yes you did  Who the hell knew who you were  You see  Take you out of these studios  And nobody knows who you are  Exactly  Well we were broadcasting live  From the Sexpo  At the Javits Center  You remember that  Oh yeah  There was  I wandered in there  On a weird Friday afternoon  You had a bag full of goodies

[01:27:00]  Did you?  Yes you did  You waved a one finger salute  Robin please come here  What did you buy?  I was good begging  And you just flipped us the bird  And walked away  But it gave us  Something to talk about  See people don't actually think  That I behave rudely like that  You really?  We joke about it  Yeah  You were incognito  You had the glasses on  The shades  And the hat  Down over his face  Still  We recognized you  Well because  I think it's the image you got  Because of the lifestyles  Of the rich and famous show  And stuff  That everybody perceives you  As this you know  Kind of stuffy fellow  I don't think so young men 
[01:27:30]  No I think they do  They know  But you're a down earth kind of guy  The Brits are a rather wild  Raucous group of people  Oh really?  Oh yeah  Oh really?  Remember  Remember what Prince Charles  Wanted to come back as?  What?  A tampon  Inside  The body of his loved one  That's right  Right  Right boy  And he's a wild one  And he was honest about it  Isn't he a wild crazy kind of guy?  I think he is  I don't think so  Mr. Leach

[01:31:00]  With chocolate or something  Yeah  With some  Oh yes  Grossly  Yeah  Yeah I remember that one  Another grossly exaggerated story  It was like some young blonde chicks  And uh  They said there were nine of them  Right  Nine naked women  That walked with me into a casino  And you were pouring chocolate on women  It's so  It's so preposterous  That that could have happened  If you'd have been arrested  The second that you walked into a casino  I would have admitted it  Come on  I know  But always stories about  How you're out  Never admit anything  On the prowl

Yes  You know it was originally  Before it was a movie  It was originally a musical in London  Yes  In London  Written in a peak of  Fit of anger  30 odd years ago  Yeah  By a man who got a reject slip  For another play that he wrote  Of course it was  And cast all the evil people in his life  Into the Rocky Horror Show 
[01:37:30]  Of course it was started in London  Oh this fag city  Rick  He's making fun of your city there  What's the largest selling chocolate in Pennsylvania you fool?  Big shot  Hershey  Very good  Anyway  Highway anyone?  Anyway  Anyway  It sort of  It failed  As a  Right  Musical in London  And then it was taken over as a  Cult picture  Didn't do well in the movie when it first came out  No but look at it 
[01:38:00]  It goes to the careers of Susan Saran and Barry Boswick  And still plays at the East 8th Street Playhouse here in Manhattan  Every Friday and Saturday  I went to that one day  And now  A year and a half ago  They revived it as a musical on Broadway  And here I am  Stepping into the shoes of Big Dick  Now who else do we have  Who else do we have  In the cast right now?  You said Sebastian Bach  And we have  Terrence  Yeah  And we have  Sebastian  Oh I said Sebastian Bach 
[01:38:30]  Yeah that's great  He's got a great voice  I hope you saw him  In  Jekyll and Hyde  Terrence Mann who plays Frankenfurter  Here on Broadway  Has one of the most exquisite voices  And exactly looks like Tim Curry's younger son  Oh really?  Extraordinary  Does he?  Yeah  Extraordinary  Extraordinary  Nice legs  Better than my sixth wife  How many times have you been married?  Once  Oh just once?  Yeah yeah  And then what happened there?  You just  Because now you get an older girl  Did you get famous and toss her to the waist?  No no no no no  Don't tell me something depressing like she died or something 
[01:39:00]  No no no no no  Although there were nights when I felt she had  But I'll go  I'll get in that one  I wanted mothers, daughters and grandmothers  You guys would believe any story that you're told  You know something  Don't ever tell us that's a lie  La la la  I am not listening to you  You don't get out very often do you  I want to believe that Robin Leach actually did that  La la la  He definitely did the grandma 
[01:39:30]  The mom and the daughter  You know why? Because if you got it  Then it gives all of us hope that maybe someday we can actually do that  That's right  Also Robin  I actually did get married to twins once  In a mock ceremony at a hotel in California  Really?  Yes  How'd that work out for you?  Well it was just a fun thing to see if we could pull off  What the hell?  Was it hard to drive home with both hands hanging out the window?  No we stayed the night  I have drivers  Joe the mailman  What's up?  Hey what's up guys?  You guys rule man 
[01:40:00]  Thanks  Joe are you coming to see Rocky Horror?  I'll be there  I'll be there man  You better be  I gotta be because I'm a big fan of you  Especially when you were on the Jeffersons back in the day  Like in the beginning credits  When you're walking up and down towards his back  You were awesome man  Jefferson  Listen smart ass  I'll do the humor around this joint  Well he's a little confused right now  That was a different guy  That was a different era  What's his name?  Paul  Robeson  Yes  Dennis what's up?  Hey  Hey 
[01:40:30]  Robin can you do the Knight Rider voice for me?  Hi I'm David Hasselhoff  Oh you're the guy in the car  Michael I need you  Michael I need you  Hey guys you guys suck  Thank you man  I'm gonna go over to the Rana Fest from last night  Alright good  See you  Bye  Do they get actually excited that they can say that on radio?  Oh yeah  Yeah they do  They make us laugh  They've made a wild contribution to the success of the rebuilding of New York with that 
[01:41:00]  Absolutely  They're very proud and very happy to be here with us  Pat what's up?  Hey how you doing guys?  Alright  I saw Robin after a Nick game across the street of the parking garage about five six years ago  Yeah  And he's with this smoking blonde  So I was just wondering how's your granddaughter doing today?  Yeah  Back to your ruffing  You were the smoking blonde there  That's good  These guys  Only one  You'll live in the life  These guys  They're so jealous  They're so jealous  They're happy for you Robin 
[01:41:30]  I'm pleased  When in your life  Yes and she was smoking  Were you able to start scoring the younger hot girls?  When did that happen for you?  It's always been  Was that always like that?  Yeah  You know because guys are you know  You look great  Here is the secret  But you know some of the guys of your age aren't normally with the  Let's ask ourselves some basic questions  Yes  How the hell did David Copperfield wind up with Claudia Schiffer?  Beard  Beard  It was a beard  No  You're wrong 
[01:42:00]  What?  Because I know all the intimacy  He does  Of the stars  Here's the thing  The most gorgeous girls in the world  Gorgeous girls  How do you spell girls?  Are left unattended  Really?  By the guys  Because most of you guys  Are scared stiff  That you're going to be rejected  Result being  Most beautiful women  Sit home alone  Or go out together  You know what Robin's saying right here?  And he eats the peach  He gives attention to that area 
[01:42:30]  And the balloon knot  And the balloon knot  He'll flip them over  Right?  Yep  You know what the balloon knot is Robin?  No  Obviously something to do with mules and donkeys  It's the American phrase for the back door area  Really?  Because if you tie a balloon in a knot  You blow it up and tie it in a knot  And look right into it  Oh it's like that thing on the internet  Where you have to guess the peach from all of the others  Well but if you tie a balloon in a knot  After you blow it up  And look right into where you blew it up  It's that puckering area  Sweetheart I have no time in my life to tie up 
[01:43:00]  Well love  I have no time to tie up balloons  All right sweetie pie  To look like a tush  Well it would look like that  So we call it a balloon knot  Really?  It sounds to me like  You're saying to be attentive to these women  Would you say to a beautiful woman  Yes  Darling  Let me just give you a little champagne  And by the way may I compliment you on your balloon knot  You've died  Right  At that moment  I'll give you that  At that moment  Although with an English accent  It sounds feasible to me  No the thing you're supposed to say 
[01:43:30]  Shh don't yell and this will be over soon  Hey Beth  You're next with Robin Leach  Hi  Hi  How are you guys today?  Good  Well I just had a question  You guys were talking about  Robin being hung like a mule  Yeah  But every time  I did not say that  Well it's being said  So my question is sort of a challenge  In every National Enquirer picture you see  You're in a speedo  And if you were hung like a mule  That's where it'd show  But I'm not seeing it  But you have to remember  What a flat photo looks like 
[01:44:00]  Oh see it's not three dimensional  But still they catch you in all those odd shots  Yeah what are you doing in a speedo anyway  On those European beaches and whatnot  There was one shot  Yeah  One speedo  Why were you in a speedo?  That's common sense  Because even idiots make mistakes on occasion  Because we didn't know that the National Enquirer  Was sneaking in the bushes  We had telephoto lenses  And that's the other reason why it doesn't look as if 
[01:44:30]  There's any prize money in the kitty tonight  Because at 300 feet on a long Tom lens  Everything vanishes  And maybe the water was cold at the beach that day  And you had some shrinkage  That happens  Take care  Bye  Thank you very much for your intellectual question  Yes  And now who's next?  Stupid American bitch  Top of the form continues in just a moment  With the brains trust  Listen you guys  I've got to go to a stage  Oh yeah 
[01:45:00]  Yes  I know you were  Play the music again  I'll stay for 60 seconds  We thought you really liked us and stuff  No no no  It was just a way to get cheap publicity  At Russia  Of course  You know  God bless you man  Robin  Thank you  Thank you  How long are you going to be with Rocky Horror?  I'm Rocky Horror  Through Sunday Night  Through Sunday Night  Yeah  You've got Saturday afternoon  Sunday afternoon  And then every evening  And then the evening  Well Mike wants to say something real fast  Mike  Go ahead Mike  Hey guys  How you doing?  Alright  I just wanted to compliment you 
[01:45:30]  The first people in human history  To ever make Robin Leach sound cool  And you sound like you rock  Every time I saw you  And Lifestyle's original famous  I hated you  This is the first time I take it all back  You're cool  Hey there you go  Well there you go  Cool at 60  Nice  That's a compliment  Thank you very much  Cool at 60  No problem  Thank you sir  No you know  When we did that show  We had to convey this sort of  Stiff upper lip  Right  You know  It was done deliberately  And  You're presenting palaces  What you see  Is me now 
[01:46:00]  This is me  I have a good time  I rock  All the time  I don't doubt it  I actually rock all the time  Which is why you've got to come see Rocky Horror  But  When I was doing that television show  We had to have this air of somber  And  We're better than you  No no no  I was only  That's how I felt like  I was only the reporter  I was only the guy  Describing everything  I swear to you  When I was watching  When I was watching that show  He's going through these marble floors  And beautiful  Big  Vaulted ceilings 
[01:46:30]  I was watching that show  Sitting on a couch  With duct tape  On my armrest  Going  This sucks man  Yeah  This sucks  You were still curious  You see  And you know what  The saddest part  Turn it off and discuss  That was last night  The saddest part of the whole thing  Do you ever get resentful  With the money  That you were kind of pointing out  Like just want to take a dump  In the closet  No  No  No  Because I have it too  Because everybody in America  Wants to be Horatio Alger  You see  You come to work for WNEW  You don't want to labor here 
[01:47:00]  For the rest of your lives  You want to strive higher  You want to move up the ladder  Television  Movies  And make more money  You don't want to make less money  Do you  That's right  This is the American dream  Wow  This is the only country in the world  Where you can better yourselves  And not go downhill  He's pulling a Tony Robbins on us  I'm feeling inspired  You're scaring me  Man has more teeth in his mouth  Than a watermelon  We've got to let Robin Leach go  Robin thank you  We see you  Take care  Robin Leach  Uh oh 
[01:47:30]  He's coming around the console  Oh  Okay  Shaking hands  Anthony we'll be back  All right  Robin champagne wishes  And caviar dreams  Thank you Robin  Robin Leach rocks  And we'll be back  The Opie and Anthony show  What do you do here  Look at breasts  If I wasn't on this show  I'd be out there with a wow sticker  Just trolling for breasts  Thank you  Oh yeah

Oh the car is great man  I'm telling you  This Mercedes  I'm going to drive it  This weekend  To the stress factory  Oh wow
