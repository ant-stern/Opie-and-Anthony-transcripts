<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, heavily focused on the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, began with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – discussing the widespread devastation in the New York City area.  They detailed power outages, crippling traffic (including a three-person-per-car rule), gas shortages, and the general societal breakdown.  One host recounted a particularly aggressive commute home, culminating in writing "fuck you" in the dust on an SUV.  The chaotic scenes at bus stops, fueled by limited service, and the difficulties in obtaining gas, including the use of bribery, were vividly described.  Callers shared their frustrations with power companies and the lack of service credits.  Michu Kaku was seen but not interacted with. A caller from Iraq shared pictures and videos depicting significant flooding and damage in Breezy Point and Bell Harbor.  The hosts discussed the slow power restoration, infrastructure repair challenges, inefficiency of solar power, and the damage in Long Beach.  The overall tone was a mixture of shock, anger, frustration, and dark humor.

The show continued with further discussion of Sandy's impact, particularly in Hoboken and New Jersey, including flooded apartments and power outages.  Hosts shared their experiences navigating traffic and gas shortages, with one recounting driving over a median to bypass traffic. The lack of gas, spoiled food, and political commentary ensued, with positive remarks on the bipartisan cooperation between Governor Chris Christie and President Obama, interspersed with disparaging jokes about Christie's weight and appearance.  A video of Christie consoling a resident was shown and mocked. Jim Florentine, a guest in the studio, shared humorous anecdotes about his family's experiences during the storm, contrasting his own attitude with his brother's seeming enjoyment of the situation. The conversation veered into family dynamics, board games, the lack of cell service, the New York Jets, Tim Tebow, and a crude prank involving a coworker.  Anthony Cumia's blackjack guide was promoted.

A significant portion focused on sports commentary: the Giants' World Series win, the Yankees' poor performance (with racially charged commentary about Jeremy Lin), low World Series viewership, and criticism of Tim McCarver.  The recurring "Curse Man" prank call bit was revisited, along with Jim Florentine's stand-up anecdotes (including impersonating Curtis in Canada).  RZA and Sway were mentioned as potential guests but didn’t appear. The segment included extremely offensive jokes about the "John and Jeff" show and a West Side Highway traffic jam due to a police checkpoint.

The show then discussed podcast host Jay Moore's unpaid sponsorship with Flex Sports Watches, leading to reminiscing about old radio advertising practices and Opie’s experience with AdamandEve.com.  An anecdote about a demanding newspaper customer and memories of paper routes, including a joking tangent about childhood molestation, followed.  The "Curse Man" bit was played again, featuring numerous expletives and crude jokes targeting Madonna. A caller, Scott from New Jersey, reported increased crime and violence, prompting accusations of racism.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the "Curse Man" bit and the storm's impact on traffic and transportation, with a live call describing chaotic situations at Barclays Center. Jim Florentine remained a prominent studio guest,  RZA was mentioned as a scheduled guest to discuss chess, and the song "Hey Masturbator" was played.  Florentine’s flatulence was mentioned.

A conversation with RZA (heavily implied, not explicitly stated) then ensued, covering his career, overcoming hardship, near-imprisonment, success, observational learning from Quentin Tarantino on the set of *Kill Bill*, and directing *The Man with the Iron Fist*. The film's cast (Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu, Kung Lee) was mentioned, along with discussions of "fast money," helping family, and past life choices.  The show's staff (Eric, Roland, Sal) discussed the post-apocalyptic humor of the storm's aftermath, including plans involving gold, guns, and acquiring virgins and slaves.  Tangents on US vs. Canada's crisis responses and the "haves" vs. "have-nots" followed.  Jim Florentine's stand-up performances and Stephen Singer Jewelers were advertised.

The final excerpt detailed a surprise live show from Opie’s apartment due to the hurricane, featuring Opie, Anthony, Roland, Jess, and "the girls," with calls from Eric and Joe DeRosa.  The show, re-airing Saturday and Sunday, replacing Anthony's Sunday show, had technical issues requiring Sal to rerecord the intro. Listener calls included inquiries about the taste of semen and the value of gold.  Morbidly humorous discussions of cannibalism, particularly the preparation and serving of Eric's body parts, ensued.  "Jocktober" ended, with a tribute to the "John and Jeff" show.  Discussions about creating a cult, with Eric as the fisherman and Roland as the hunter, further involving the cannibalistic preparation of Eric’s body parts, followed. Sal arrived, and the possibility of his own show was discussed.  The broadcast concluded with promotion of the show's Facebook page and regular programming schedule.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second. 
[00:00:30]  Someone said we curse a lot, do we? I have no idea if we do.  Sue Fletcher, who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Rules are destroyed, and conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I wouldn't eat Petty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Oh, you want to hear the greatest of all?  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Yeah.  Hi, Jim.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh, what's wrong with Jimmy?  Everyone's in a great fucking mood. 
[00:02:00]  What?  What happened?  You looked a little agitated, Jimmy.  We just walked in just as we started talking.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah.  I walked in three minutes ago.  Additional travel time, even from where we are.  It's going down 9th Avenue.  It's fucking...  I've been leaving actually a little earlier than I have been when the disaster isn't striking.  And still, the mayor made a little rule that... 
[00:02:30]  We said you would hate it.  We said you would hate it.  Jerry's got a new mic stand.  We said you would hate it.  I don't mind it, except it's hitting Anthony's mic with his computer.  It does bump into my monitor.  Wow.  I'm sure they checked that out ahead of time before you used it.  Oh, I don't know.  That's fine.  Thanks, buddy.  There we go.  You're gonna hate it.  Yeah, the mayor's got a three-person car rule.  Three person per vehicle.  Starting this morning at 6 a.m., so if you're not in the city at 6 a.m., you're fucked. 
[00:03:00]  So 6 a.m., you gotta have three people or more in your vehicle, or you're turned away at all the crossings.  Which, by the way, is pretty smart, because yesterday it was complete gridlock in Manhattan.  Complete gridlock.  I cannot even tell you the anger.  I live a mile away, a mile and a half, just to give you an idea.  45 minutes.  45 minutes.  And I'm not bitching, trust me.  I'm just giving you an idea.  Well, how about from the studios here?  To your house, yeah. 
[00:03:30]  No, to the Queensborough Bridge.  That's no more than, what, two miles?  I've done that in three to four minutes.  Right.  When there's no one on the road, like, very early in the morning.  Yeah, yesterday, amazing, right?  You've got a flying car, obviously.  How long, Danny, was that about?  I would say hour 45.  From there, that's before I started my trip home.  Like, on the actual highway, you know.  That's just getting off of Manhattan.  An hour and 45 fucking minutes.  Were you annoyed? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, was I ever!  Or, hence the camera that I had stuck on my windshield for the drive-in, because people  were saying I should have.  I was pulling moves, and still getting fucking, it took an hour and 45 minutes.  And believe me, I was making some headway.  I had a piss at one point, and the traffic was so bad that I just got out.  He got out of the car.  I was on First Avenue.  I went to a McDonald's.  There was a line.  I sat in the line.  I would have just peed in my pants.  I pissed.  Walked out of McDonald's.  Walked back to the truck.  Walked up like a block, and I was still there.  Oh, really?  Like, it didn't matter.  I just walked the block and a half, and there it was. 
[00:04:30]  And let me tell you something.  It's fucking amateur hour, because the people that usually take mass transit have decided  to drive in, and they don't even know what it's like to drive in Manhattan.  You need to fucking get on it.  You gotta make moves.  You gotta make moves.  You gotta fucking go.  You gotta be alert.  You gotta, the second the light turns green, you gotta fucking go.  You gotta look.  If you're in an intersection, and the light is green, and there's cars in front of you,  and you might block the box, you can't move.  You can't make that.  But if you see cars starting to move, then you gotta move and go, because you know you 
[00:05:00]  got a spot.  Right, right.  People that don't move, and then the cars around them get in front of them, and they  fuck you.  But even that wouldn't help.  No, it wouldn't.  There's way too many fucking cars in this city right now.  Not only did I beep, here's what one intersection held for me.  There was an SUV, and he was totally blocking the intersection, like fucking dead stop, and  probably two cycles of a light, and he's still there.  In the middle of the intersection, people beep and go crazy.  So finally, I edge around, and now I'm going past him. 
[00:05:30]  And my driver's side window now is right next to his giant back SUV window, which I made  sure I got right up to it.  And I was just going to stop banging on it.  I was going to break his window.  I was going to do...  And then I was like, oh, it's very dusty.  So I just stopped, and now people are beeping at me, and wrote, fuck you in the dust.  In the window.  All I thought is how pissed he'd be that the rest of the ride, he's going to look in his  mirror and just see that, my dumb finger printed, fuck you, on his back window. 
[00:06:00]  Where's the video?  Well, I didn't have a camera yesterday.  That's funny.  You got an iPhone.  Well, that was only one.  You know, it would have been so much better if I did have video, because I think I don't  see many people changing lanes from the lower level, outer bridge lane to the inside  under bridge of the 59th Street Bridge.  Nice.  You say it's impossible.  I say.  How do you do that?  Exactly.  It's possible. 
[00:06:30]  It's probably the first and foremost, most dangerous thing I've ever done in my life.  How do you do that?  I've never seen Danny more excited for anything.  We're about to do it.  He's like, yeah.  I always want to do this.  Yeah, he's going to do it.  He's going to do it.  Yeah.  Because it enters your brain when you're on that outer roadway, and you go, oh, man,  wouldn't it be cool to try to get to the inner road?  And you go, no, that's crazy.  I'd never do that.  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  You've got to explain it to the rest of the country.  They don't even know this bridge.  There are certain gaps.  It's a lane that literally looks like it's going to fall into the river.  It's hanging on the edge of the bridge.  They just added a lane outside the bridge. 
[00:07:00]  And there's a giant steel barrier between that.  Right.  And it's actually the superstructure of the bridge is between that lane and the actual  lanes of the bridge traffic.  But there are these minute little openings for, I guess, emergency vehicles or something.  It has to be for access.  They come up every so often.  I saw one, and I'm like, I think I could squeak through there.  And I make the turn.  And now it's pretty blind when you're jumping onto that roadway.  Oh, my God.  Because you've got the big girders to the 59th Street Bridge in your way. 
[00:07:30]  So you just kind of edge out a little.  And then I finally saw.  I was able to see.  Got on that.  It smooth sailing.  We watched that outer bridge traffic, which was dead stopped, just flying by as we just  went right on down that fucking road.  And then we hit the expressway, which was then fine.  But we saw the other way that was coming into Manhattan.  It was backed up for probably five solid miles of bumper to bumper traffic. 
[00:08:00]  They shut down the Midtown Tunnel, which is a giant entrance to Manhattan.  The only other way off the expressway to come into Manhattan is the 59th Street Bridge.  But you've got to go through side streets, pretty much, in Queens Plaza, which is, it's  not like this giant interchange where it's an on-ramp to get on a big bridge.  It's a little town.  And it's all lights, right?  All lights.  And you would think they would have cops at all those lights just going, you know  what?  If you're on one of these side streets right now, you're fucked.  We've got to keep the traffic moving.  Here's another thing people don't understand.  Did they have anybody out there? 
[00:08:30]  On the way home, they did.  Not on the way in.  And that was when it was really bad.  And people don't understand.  Lights are completely fucking optional in these emergency circumstances.  A cop is not going to give you a ticket for a fucking light when disaster is all over  the place.  So they don't know sometimes.  Just go.  Just fucking go.  So that's, my whole logic was just fucking, you know, golf.  Do you know, that's a weird thing.  I was walking home from the gym yesterday, and that's how you know something was different,  because it was on Amsterdam Avenue, it was all bumper to bumper, and I'm crossing, I have 
[00:09:00]  green to go, and cars are just slowly running the red light.  Yeah.  And a guy's coming up on me, and I'm like, it's a fucking red light.  Yeah.  Sorry, Jim.  It was weird how that little weird thing breaks down, that he's just going to get where  he's going to go, and fuck it, and no mercy.  You can start to see cracks.  Yeah, there are some cracks starting.  Well, we said three days.  The gasoline situation is terrible.  Well, hold on.  Before we move on to that, did you see the video of everyone pushing onto the city bus? 
[00:09:30]  No.  Bad?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Breaking down.  It's breaking down.  Breaking down.  And we said three days.  People are cool and want to help their neighbors for three days.  And then after that, forget it.  AC?  Yeah.  Oh.  After that, forget it.  Yeah.  And yesterday, they only have a few city buses running yesterday.  Yeah, limited swifts.  And a lot of people needed to get on that fucking bus, and they were pushing and showing.  What are they?  And trying to push their friends on. 
[00:10:00]  Every bus we saw was jam-packed with people.  Have you been downtown?  I don't know how much gas does I want to leave.  I have not gone down.  I feel like if I jumped in my car and went downtown, and I like stormtrooping, I would  get carjacked.  Yeah?  Just so they could charge their phone.  Yeah, absolutely.  You think?  Yeah.  You've got to have a piece on you.  You've got to get a piece.  I want to do that.  I want to drive down.  People want to charge their phones.  So they would do whatever it takes, meaning they would take your car so they could fucking 
[00:10:30]  pop their phone in.  A lot of these people with generators are putting these big power strips out there and  letting people come up and plug their phones in and shit, which is pretty goddamn cool.  That's for like 12 people.  Yeah, but you know, if a bunch of people do it, it's better than nothing.  I saw one of those pictures in the paper that looked all nice, but there's so many more  people trying to figure out how to fucking charge their phone.  I'm just waiting for a couple of days when guys just come swooping by with their arm out,  grabbing all the cords and just running off with everybody's phone.  Good luck with that.  Yeah?  I think an old lady would chase you down with a hammer. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's getting to that point.  It's getting a little ragged around the edges.  It's getting a little blurry.  What's up with the gas situation?  I retweeted your gas thing yesterday.  Yes.  The gas, especially on Long Island in Nassau County, some places in Westchester, Manhattan  is pretty bad, in Jersey especially, they're just not getting these fuel deliveries.  A lot of the stations where they pump the fuel into these big trucks had no power.  The debris kept a lot of the big trucks from getting out onto Long Island and these other 
[00:11:30]  places.  So there were two gas stations open in the entire driving radius of where I live, and  they were mobbed, just lines and lines of fucking people.  Right.  And they're starting to yell at each other.  You're hearing a lot of this, hey, hey, hey, bro!  Hey, bro!  Hey, hey, hey!  Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Hold up, hold up!  What are you doing?  No, no, I'm pulling in there!  Like, a lot of these, like, yelling is going on, and I come up with my big gas cans. 
[00:12:00]  I got, like, big gas cans for my generator.  And what I do is, I walk up to the gas pump, I put my gas cans down, and some people start  looking like, hey, I'm fucking...  And then the owner comes over, and I slip him a fucking deuce.  I slip him a 20, and my credit card, so he could slip that thing in there, you know,  and start pumping.  And he pumps it.  Yes, my friend!  Boom!  Instant fucking first in line.  Wow.  We've reached the point where bribery is now taking hold, which is phase two. 
[00:12:30]  Bribery.  And being able to get what you need based on how much money you're willing to cough up  and grease the people.  I swear to you, if you can't get things up and running in a week...  It's all over.  It's completely over.  It's fucking over.  Total breakdown of society.  Tomorrow it's going to get ugly.  Trains are back today, though.  There's limited service.  They're limited, though.  Limited.  Limited.  Very limited.  They're letting enough progression news out to let people know, oh, it's coming back.  But that's just enough to get the pushing and shoving going. 
[00:13:00]  To try to keep people from...  Because not everyone's going to get on those fucking trains.  Yes!  I heard cell phones are no good below, like, 39th Street.  The cabbie today gave me a good schooling on the way in.  Did he?  He said people are taking cabs to 42nd Street.  To make phone calls?  Yeah.  The tower's down there, and a lot of the cases are messed up.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're walking over the 39th, you know, to the 40th Street, and then they're  good.  Half the city's dark.  It's the weirdest fucking...  I want to go down tonight and see.  Yeah.  You see some of the pictures of the skyline, where it's all lit up and then completely 
[00:13:30]  dark on the right side?  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I wound up having to take the fucking Triborough in today.  It was crazy.  There was no way I was going to try that Queensborough again.  So the mayor knew we had to get some of these cars out of fucking Manhattan, so it's  a carpooling situation.  If you don't have a car with three people in it, they are turning you away, and they're  not listening to anyone's fucking excuses.  No, no sob stories.  But they're all coming in before six now.  Although I saw a lot of people when I was on the parkway that were getting off onto the  expressway to go to the Queensborough, that they weren't fucking going to make it. 
[00:14:00]  Well, of course they're coming in before six.  Yeah.  I mean, because they can't find two dummies to ride in with.  I know, but I mean, of course...  That's why I'm thinking the mayor should just make it three people, regardless of the fucking  time.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  It's an emergency.  You can't have the gridlock like we had yesterday.  You can't fucking have it.  It's insanity.  He's still going to have a lot of cars because people will beat the curfew.  When you have an emergency vehicle sitting in traffic like that...  First responders.  Yeah, first responders.  Who, by the way, are going through their own shit.  Yeah.  I can't imagine being a first responder where your house is completely destroyed, but 
[00:14:30]  you've got to help everyone else out first.  I think it's therapeutic.  I think it kind of keeps your mind off of things.  So weird, though.  There's only so much you could do.  You've got to wait for insurance companies.  You're trained to take care of people and property, and you can't take care of your  own people and property at first.  I've spoken to a few people that are in that situation.  God bless those guys, is what I want to say.  And gals.  And gals.  And gals.  And gals in that situation.  We're making the muffins.  They've all said that it takes their mind off of it.  It takes their mind off of their own bullshit when they've got to dig in there and help 
[00:15:00]  other people out.  We've got a marathon.  They're going to run it anyway.  Sunday, right?  Why would you run the marathon?  People love running, too.  Bloomberg said it's good for the economy.  There's all these small businesses that make money.  All right.  That's true.  I guess you can't delay it, because the top runners go elsewhere after the marathon.  I guess Con Ed is turning power on to the people in Manhattan and lower Manhattan.  They're kind of getting it on there.  You mean that monopoly called Con Ed?  Don't con me, Ed.  Yes, Con Ed. 
[00:15:30]  It's a bit of a monopoly there.  People question if their equipment is up to standards.  It is hard to have a choice in power companies where you live, because, I mean, it's with  an infrastructure in place, and it's kind of hard to have a competing power company,  you know, in any place.  But why would you upgrade all your shit if you're a monopoly?  Well, exactly, yeah.  Why would you?  I guess to keep people from fucking hating you.  Yeah, my point is you would do the bare minimum. 
[00:16:00]  Do the bare minimum.  Why would you do a complete upgrade?  Yeah.  Why?  I don't know.  You have no competition.  And that costs a lot of money.  That takes away from the profits.  I never understood that, monopolies like that.  I was watching Bill O'Reilly, and he was talking about Long Island, because he lives on Long Island,  and the power structure in Nassau County, which is where I live also.  And how Nassau County pays the highest taxes in the country as a town, as a county.  It's the highest fucking taxes in the country. 
[00:16:30]  They're huge taxes.  Yet they don't have the money to upgrade the infrastructure.  The power is constantly going out in Nassau County.  Constantly.  And it shouldn't be that way.  But there's just no money.  And when you're paying that much in taxes, and there's no money left to do something,  there's a problem.  Of course.  Where's your money going?  Someone's fucking with the money.  Where's your money going?  We don't know where our money goes.  Yeah, and that seems to be...  Most people have no idea where our money goes.  And that seems to be a giant fucking problem.  Dude, you know, my years of living on Long Island, even just a little windstorm fucking 
[00:17:00]  lights went out all over the place.  Always knocks out the power.  Always.  It's terrible.  So I'm still on generator power.  You know, I wake up in the middle of the night, pour some gas in, go back to sleep,  wake up in the morning, pour some gas in, leave.  You know, it's...  That's just like someone going, hey, you know what?  I'm going to spend today trying to find where my house floated to.  Exactly.  It's just like it.  You know, we all have our crosses to bear.  We all have our stories.  Yeah.  Well, actually, I don't have a story. 
[00:17:30]  I feel kind of guilty.  I have survivor guilt.  I have survivor guilt.  Yeah, so it's still really fucking crazy out there.  The pictures and the video coming in, my God.  They still haven't shown everything.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  The images are just unbelievable.  Yeah.  I guess LaGuardia is opening later.  Like Jersey Shore.  It's basically been completely destroyed.  Just gone. 
[00:18:00]  All the little attractions and whatnot.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I passed by LaGuardia before when I was coming in on the parkway and...  Still a lake?  Oh, my God.  You look out and I guess they're going to open it for limited service at 7, they said.  Yeah.  But there are certain areas that are just fucking completely underwater.  It's amazing.  It looks like part of the bay is just up to the highway.  And is that where the bay is going to be now, you think?  I don't know.  They got to pump that shit out.  Because the old days, the shit would happen like, oh, I guess we got a new lake. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, let's redraw the maps.  But now we try to put it all back to how it was.  We like things the way they were.  We like things the way we're used to.  I don't think that's how it was at the turn of the century.  It's like, oh, looks like I now got oceanfront property.  Cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Some depressing stuff on the news yesterday.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, it's terrible.  The woman who's fucking two kids.  Yeah, that's just...  The car, they were in a car.  And the car got like flipped over or something.  Yeah.  And she was holding her kids, her babies, and a fucking wave came and took them. 
[00:19:00]  Yeek.  And I'm like, you know, anyone, if you're really still going to church and thanking God for your good luck, you're fucking dumb.  Works in mysterious ways, Jim.  Mysterious ways.  Even if he is there, I'm sorry.  He's a shithead.  There's a reason he did that.  Mysterious ways.  We just don't understand it.  Oh, God, was it irritating?  He needed two little angels.  That's all I thought of watching the news yesterday.  Yeah.  I know people got their religion, and good for you guys, but how do you fucking...  How does that wash in your fucking brain? 
[00:19:30]  It's hard to have faith at times when you see some of the shit that goes down.  Yeah.  I completely agree with you.  Thank God for saving my business.  I understand that emotion, but really?  So God's like, hey, do I save that hardware store?  Or those two kids?  Right, right.  Yeah, let her hold the kids for a minute, and then fuck it, I'll have a wave knock.  Can you have anything more biblical than a wave taking your babies?  That's pretty bad.  Let's give her a little hope, and then we're going to yank those two kids away from her.  Oh, my God.  That really annoyed me.  But she'll be in church probably.  There's the bus video.  Oh, man.  Good luck. 
[00:20:00]  Look at it.  It's a fucking catastrophe.  Look at people like, fuck.  Wow.  I think we're really lucky that tomorrow's Friday.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, because the three-day rule, we'll put up with shit for three days as  humans, and then after that, fuck it.  A weekend, people.  People put up with a weekend, too, because you get to sit back and drink.  Well, the weekend's easy.  And not have to worry about getting to work.  Yeah, the weekend's a little easier, but one more day of work.  Tomorrow could be a little ugly.  Yeah.  And then we'll take a little break, and then Monday, hopefully, we're on our way. 
[00:20:30]  Hopefully, shit gets taken care of.  Yeah.  I got to fly tomorrow.  We're going to JFK.  You should leave now.  I know.  I know.  That's going to be a nightmare ride.  Cross town to JFK.  How many trees are down on Long Island?  I want to get out there so badly.  There's a lot of trees down, but a lot of them are cut off where they were crossing the  roads and shit.  So you'll see giant trunks of trees on the sides of the road, kind of edging into the  road a little bit, but then they're just sawn off completely straight where the big branches 
[00:21:00]  were in the road.  So a lot of that's cleared out.  A lot of wires still down.  There's, even by my house, they got these giant, just, it looks like a big tangled mess  of wires, like spider webs, hanging in the street with police tape crisscrossing all over  it so people don't crash into them.  But a lot of fucking wires still down.  Yeah.  Are you tired of the power being out in your area with the taxes you guys pay?  Yeah.  It's fucking enraging.  It really is enraging.  LIPA said, because people have been bitching, so they sent out emails to everybody because 
[00:21:30]  they haven't seen any LIPA cruiser trucks anywhere fixing this shit.  Right.  So they say that their first, what we need to do is get the infrastructure going in the  substation.  That's where our work has been.  And then by today, later on today, you're going to see the trucks as they branch out to get  into the neighborhoods.  Let me ask you, a lot of people be in inconvenience with their power out.  Now, when their bill comes in, do they get to write it off a little bit?  How does that work?  Well, I gather the power they weren't using, but all those little taxes and things and 
[00:22:00]  charges and equipment fees, those, oh, you got to pay that shit.  And this is the shit that drives me nuts on a daily basis.  But if you fuck up, and if your bill is late or something, oh, they'll kill you, right?  Say, hey, the storm.  Right.  I'll pay my bill late and then just go, I'll send a note and say, hey, it was the storm.  I couldn't pay you.  They won't even pay attention to that.  But wait, because of the storm, you couldn't give me power.  So because of the storm, I can't give you money.  It all evens out.  So how do the people get power?  Meaning power, like, where we go, you know what? 
[00:22:30]  Fuck you.  You inconvenienced me and my family for two weeks.  I'm not paying you the full fucking nut.  You don't.  Of course not.  There's no way to get any fucking juice with these people.  It drives me insane, though, that it only works one way.  The legal system is the only way, or you drag them out in the street and beat them to death.  But the legal system is the only way.  A bloody revolution.  I don't know how it got to the point where we have no control over this shit as a populace.  You know, I don't understand that.  You know, fucking them lighting up the tollboots yesterday when all of Jersey was dark. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  The people should have fucking ripped the tollboots down.  We're just driven through them without pay.  Well, then they get you, you know, with the license plates, you know, they got the cameras  and they got the, you know, the easy pass shit.  They're going to get you.  And today, with mass transit all fucked up still because of the storm, I heard, but they  go alternate side is suspended, but feed those meters.  So they're going to have their fucking parking cunts out on the road.  Of course they will.  Writing tickets.  Of course they will. 
[00:23:30]  For parking meters.  Even though people have to drive in because there's no mass transit, they're still going  to ticket everybody.  We can't even do the right thing when a disaster hits.  Oh, no.  How great would it be?  LIPA is inconveniencing a lot of fucking people, but make sure you get your bill paid  on time, man.  Pay the bill, pay the meters, pay your tolls.  I hope a parking meter person, something really bad happens to them.  I hope that crane on 57th Street goes right through their head.  Oh, would that be great?  Imagine if it fell on a busload of parking meter people.  But no, I mean, just me and somebody in the public is just like, look, and then just  fucking decides to beat one of them to death. 
[00:24:00]  How great would that be?  I got to point out that you are almost right about the crane thing.  Almost right.  What do you mean?  And there was a solution that none of us thought of.  They are going to build another crane to get the dangling crane down.  Off another building?  Off the top of that building.  Ah.  So they're using the building.  You said they were going to build a crane right next to it.  Well, on the building.  But I mean, they'll have to go up on the other side of the building.  No.  Supposedly, they're going to build it on top of the actual building.  How are they going to get the stuff up there?  I don't know.  To be honest with you, I have no idea.  With a crane?  But that's what they said yesterday. 
[00:24:30]  So they're going to build a crane on top of the building to get rid of the dangling crane.  But I wonder if they're going to do it.  Do they have to build up?  Like, a lot of those cranes, they can do it by them.  They build themselves up.  It's a genius system.  I don't understand how it works.  Yeah.  But there's got to be a way to get all that equipment.  Because you can't get crane equipment onto the top of that building without a crane.  No.  I don't know.  Is there any crane experts?  I don't know the ins and outs of it.  But they did say on the website that they're going to build a crane on top of the building.  I wonder when that will be done.  Because I'm thinking Christmas Rush and like Midtown. 
[00:25:00]  Dude, it can't be snarled like that.  It was pretty cool.  We were driving home yesterday and looked at the crane behind us.  And Danny said, he looked out the back window, he goes, I feel like I'm looking at a celebrity.  It is really.  It's like, as you see, it's like, I saw that on the news.  Yeah, man.  And wherever you look in Manhattan, you can see it.  The angles on that thing are wild.  Yeah.  Wild.  That dangling.  It's famous.  Yeah.  Hey, I was thinking, why didn't we get him on the show? 
[00:25:30]  Because he knows about these, you know, super storms.  Maybe we could get him on today.  And I said, hi to him.  And he runs away.  Did he really?  Does he hate us?  No, he's petrified.  Or his brain is fucked up.  Jimmy's noticed he's just afraid.  He walks really fast.  And we slowed down.  We were heading out to do a little trick-or-treating.  I ran into Jimmy, actually.  And right after I saw you, I saw Michu Kaku.  We were walking up the hill together.  And all of a sudden, I just said, hey, Michu. 
[00:26:00]  Opie from Opie and Anthony.  Hi, yeah, yeah.  Hi, yeah.  Like Jimmy does.  Hi, yeah.  Hi, hi.  And I go, this is my kid.  I'm trying to, like, have a personal moment with him because he's been on our show a shitload.  No.  And he looks down at the kid like, ah, yeah.  And then he just takes off.  I don't even know what he said.  He is Mr. Scaredy Cat.  He is a weirdo.  He really is.  But his whole thing is he's thinking of string theory.  All the time.  That's what he does.  All the time.  Before he caught up with us, I saw that he was practicing something as he's walking really  fast because he was using his hands.  Oh, boy.  It's just always his mind is working.  He doesn't have that capability of looking out for danger or something. 
[00:26:30]  So he must constantly think he's in danger because his mind is working on other things.  Always busy.  That part of his brain is just dead.  Yeah.  He's one of those people.  So he just gets afraid.  He probably has autism.  He's probably an adult.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people go, where do these autistic kids go and what do they become?  They become that type of person.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  But he has no sense of fucking socializing or having just a normal conversation. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  He was probably practicing dumbing something down.  Like as he was walking, he was thinking of, and the storm is like a very angry mommy.  And the people are like little babies.  And the mommy cuts.  Downtown is in a time out.  Time out.  Here you go.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah.  We got to take some phone calls today.  Ryan in Jersey.  Go ahead.  Right. 
[00:27:30]  So I haven't had fucking power since Monday night.  And I'm looking all around my fucking blocks.  And everyone has power now.  All the lights are back up.  But just one block that I'm on doesn't have power.  So I call PSE&G.  And I'm fucking killing them over the phone.  First of all, I don't like when they say, my name is Mr. Miller.  He won't tell you his first name like a jerk off.  Right.  So I said, you know, just trying to fight with him.  When the fuck is someone going to come out here?  We don't know.  I said, okay, well, how much is the credit going to be on my bill for the outage?  And he goes, we didn't cause this hurricane, sir. 
[00:28:00]  So we don't do credit.  Is that amazing?  But just a quick contract.  And they're a monopoly.  So you can't go, well, fuck you.  I'm canceling my service today.  And I'm going with the other guy.  You don't have a choice, which drives me nuts.  But this is America, right?  That's what I said to the dude.  I said, you're the only game in town, so I guess I've got to take it until you get here.  But AT&T service has been shitty since the hurricane because the towers got beat up.  I called them and I said, you know, service is shitty.  Within a minute of calling, $50 credit to my next bill. 
[00:28:30]  Sorry about it.  Hopefully it gets better.  Because there's competition for them.  They teamed up with Verizon, too, AT&T.  To do what?  Ruined Verizon?  Oh, okay.  No, during this to use some of Verizon's towers and shit.  All right, Ryan.  I guess they're buddies.  Not the correct answer.  It's T-Mobile.  Oh, T-Mobile.  Sorry, sorry.  Go fuck yourself.  But you know why?  It's because they have competition, Ryan.  That's why.  They know you can go elsewhere.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Adrian from our fine hometown of Huntington, Long Island.  Adrian, what's up?  Hey. 
[00:29:00]  What's going on, boys?  Hey, buddy.  My girl name.  Yeah.  I thought maybe you fell on the fucking feed bag in the pet store.  Before the storm hit, Leipa accidentally disconnected my power to my house.  Oh.  And it took them six days to get the power back on.  Six days for accidentally disconnecting it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got their issues there, Leipa.  It's horrible.  We'll see what happens. 
[00:29:30]  I guess 744,000 outages left on Long Island through Leipa.  They had 900-something thousand.  So do a little bit of math.  That's, what, 20, 30 people.  Look, I understand they're in a tough spot.  They're in a tough spot, obviously.  But where's the credits for the people that are without power?  You know, you gotta give them some credit.  You gotta give them some credit.  They're gonna use helicopters to get the crane up on the top of that building.  Do you wanna see helicopters?  Really?  How cool?  I gotta see that.  Because that's gotta be one of them heavy-duty fucking helicopters.  We'll probably bring in one of those heavy-duty helicopters. 
[00:30:00]  Drop some of that crane shit up there.  On the roof.  Wow.  Okay.  That sounds dangerous.  That's what a few people are saying, so I'm assuming that's true.  Imagine a helicopter with a crane attached to it crashing in the city.  How long does it take them to build a crane up?  Like, when you bring one of those giant fuckers in, I thought they had a self-assistant where  they could kind of...  I don't know how it works, obviously.  I don't need to say I don't know how it works.  Yes.  I'm saying the crane builds itself.  Yes.  No, what they have is like this core girder thing, and it's in increments. 
[00:30:30]  And then the crane actually can lift itself up to the top of that segment.  They pop another segment on, and the crane lifts itself up on that one.  So it's constantly getting higher and higher as the building gets bigger.  So I'm guessing they'll probably put some kind of...  They'll take a lot of time to put the base up and do all that construction, and then they'll  helicopter the main heavy part in.  How the fuck do they build buildings like a mere 30, 40 years ago?  I know, right?  Because this new crane shit is very new. 
[00:31:00]  It's just people with fucking I-beams and pulleys.  Well, the crane's on top of the massive skyscraper, but it's only one story high.  Yeah.  And then the crane just grows with the building.  It grows with the building, yeah.  That's not how it used to be done, man.  No.  No.  They used to build these giant fucking cranes.  And that's why it took so much longer to build buildings in general.  Tom in Manhattan, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  One of the ways you stop being a whore with these goddamn electrical companies, you got  to push elected officials to start getting solar power. 
[00:31:30]  But the problem is these electric companies pump so much money into these officials' back  pockets, they don't want solar power because it gives us energy independence.  Solar is not economical enough right now.  It's not reliable enough.  No, that's the bullshit.  The electric companies are feeding...  Man!  I kind of agree with this guy.  All right.  I think they've been able to fucking push down the solar companies because they're so...  Well, Tom's going to tell everybody because we're listening to his radio show now. 
[00:32:00]  Don't want to interrupt him because he really knows about solar power.  Right.  Yep.  It's bullshit.  It's bullshit.  Uh-huh.  They're just using us like...  Of course.  That's it.  Man.  All right.  Bless you guys, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Why wouldn't...  Let me...  If solar energy is so economical and so easy to install and use and cost-effective, why  aren't the major power companies investing in it, putting it into their grid, and then charging 
[00:32:30]  us money to have it?  If it's easier and faster and more economical than what we're used to using for fuel for  these power companies, it would be advantageous for them to build solar power and then charge  us the amount they're charging us now, and they would save money.  So why the fuck isn't that happening?  Probably because they have to rebuild their entire system.  It would be a great investment.  Maybe they don't think so.  Why would it? 
[00:33:00]  This guy...  All you have to do is break this shit way the fuck down.  In the year 2012, really, does it make sense to fucking power everything like we do when  the sun is right there?  We couldn't figure this shit out a long time ago?  We're pretty much using the same shit we did fucking 40, 50 years ago.  Pretty much.  Solar power is pretty much based on battery power.  It doesn't go right from the sun to your fucking thing.  It goes from the sun to some kind of storage device and then out. 
[00:33:30]  It's just not economical.  But as a society, we can't figure this shit out?  I think we can.  It's ridiculous.  And he is right.  Once the...  The second the last drop of oil comes out of the ground, we will have the best, newest  power system ever.  And I do have an answer for you.  Why do they have the power lines still above the fucking roads?  Why?  Exactly.  Why?  I have no idea.  When everyone knows they should be underground, right?  Underground.  They know that's too much money.  Yeah.  That's the only reason they're not doing it.  It would cost a fuckload.  It would cost a shitload.  And that's the only reason they don't do it. 
[00:34:00]  Everyone knows it's stupid to have power lines above the ground.  Everyone.  But they continue to do it that way.  It's also the oil companies.  There's a lot of influence from...  And the Saudis.  And all these people that have a tremendous amount of money.  I mean, they really do spend a lot of money to keep gas.  That's not an accident.  I mean, there's just way too much money behind it.  And that's not paranoid.  That's just business.  Well, I guess any more companies like Solyndra that could...  Oh.  Oh, they didn't do a good job. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, that's right.  But the Saudis, you know, it's not in their best interest for America to get into, you  know, solar power.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  And I would imagine, I don't know the ins and outs, but they got, like Jimmy said, a  huge influence on the whole fucking thing.  Well.  Hmm.  Ah!  Ah, let's see.  So they're going to use the helicopter for the crane.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?  Solar...  Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  This guy's saying you're...  All right.  ...you're right on it.  Oh, no.  Bill in Atlanta.  Hello, Bill! 
[00:35:00]  How are you doing?  Hey, Bill.  Hello, Anthony.  How are you this morning?  Ah, okay.  So, I'm an engineer here in Atlanta, Georgia.  Oh, how are the trains running?  Ah, the trains are splendid.  Oh, right.  They're lovely.  Engineer.  Got it.  So, the deal is this.  Maximum efficiency of a solar cell right now is around 19%.  Mm-hmm.  And Jimmy and Opie are right.  There is some money in the oil industry that's preventing some of these things, but the fact 
[00:35:30]  of the matter is, is that when you put a solar cell into a panel, you lose efficiency.  So, the maximum efficiency we can get out of panels right now is about 16.5%.  That's not very good.  But why...  Hold on.  No, it's terrible.  All right.  It sounds...  All right.  Can we have a discussion about this?  So, why is it that we can make our fucking smartphones so goddamn powerful, but we can't figure  out how to make that more efficient?  Well, Opie, you're talking about a small level of power versus a giant power grid. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  And in order to get a farm to make a grid to power a major area like New York City, the  investment wouldn't be worth a return.  So, why can't we make that shit a lot smaller yet?  You certainly could, and the areas in the Southwest do have those grids, but it's just  not...  The technology's not there.  It's not there.  There's only so many photons that are going to hit a fucking panel.  And that's on a good day.  That's on a good day. 
[00:36:30]  So, if you make a small panel, there's still only so many fucking photons that are hitting  it.  And the photons have to do more.  For how long have these photons been getting away with doing nothing?  Why do we have to build everything flat to the ground?  Why can't we start building them upwards?  All right.  Why don't we get the stupid Apple people away from these dumb mini iPads and work on this  instead?  Listen, Opie, the technology is the best that we can push it.  We're doing thin films.  We're doing other things with oxide layers and things that are really boring. 
[00:37:00]  But the fact of the matter is that we cannot get the amount of power out.  Hold on, sir.  My question is this.  I feel like it's not a huge priority.  That's why it's taken a while to fucking figure this shit out.  There are limitations in the technology.  Here's a kind of an example of what this is like.  A solar panel, as opposed to take a water wheel and the paddles on it are the size of 
[00:37:30]  playing cards in a river.  It's not that efficient because you only have so much surface area.  If you have a giant paddle on it, it's going to be more efficient and use the power of the  water better.  Solar panels, the same thing.  You need giant panels to soak up the energy that the sun is giving off.  There's a lot of wasted energy with the sun.  Right.  At the point we're at right now, it's very difficult to efficiently harness the power of  the sun, even though it's all over the fucking place. 
[00:38:00]  We've got some bright people out there.  I hear you, but it ain't there yet.  And it's not the oil companies, and it's not the power companies.  It's a limitation on the technology right now.  All right.  I'll be real quick, and I'll get off.  There's not a concerted effort to stifle solar.  We're trying here.  The technology is not there.  And the fact of the matter is that for a decade or so, it's going to have to be fossil fuels.  And I agree we could have more efficient ways of delivering fossil fuels and other technologies 
[00:38:30]  and clean coal that Obama has decided to cut out of the equation like an idiot.  But that's a different conversation.  The solar efficiency just isn't there, man.  Well, we've talked about it, and if you're one of those guys that thinks photons are doing  all they can, you don't understand what's really happening.  Photons are lazy.  He hates the photons.  They hang out three or four on a panel doing nothing.  Nothing.  They're lazy bastards.  And they fucking assault other energy producers.  Do they? 
[00:39:00]  I don't know.  I hate those fucking photons.  Because it's just not there yet, guys.  All right.  All right.  But you sound like a photon lover.  Thanks, Bill.  Don't bring one home.  You updated my info on solar power today.  Thanks, Bill.  Sure.  All right.  Have a good day, guys.  Now, this guy, and I think we kind of said it, he works for the utility company, so he's  going to defend them, of course.  He says when the meter isn't spinning, they aren't making money.  They can't give you a credit.  I get that.  But you're depending on them for power, and you're not getting your power.  And we're still... 
[00:39:30]  So they owe you something is what I'm saying.  And we're still paying fucking service charges for the equipment that isn't working.  Your bill isn't just the money for the power you're using.  Let's go, Steve.  What do you got, buddy?  Well, you hit the nail right on the head.  But I'm not defending them.  I'm just...  You know, they sell a product to you.  They meter it with the meter that's on your house or however you guys do it down there.  And they can't make any money if it's not spinning.  So it's to their benefit that they get the power hooked back up. 
[00:40:00]  So they can start profit.  So are they going to credit me for the equipment usage charges and the line charges and all  those other little charges that are on my bill aside from the power?  I don't think that they can charge you for all that stuff if it's not in use.  Oh, they can.  Oh, they can and they will.  They can and they will, right?  It'll be on that fucking bill.  Bring in your bill.  You know, we'll prove it.  Oh, Bill!  Don't forget, bring in your bill when the power gets back on or your next bill.  And I guarantee all those charges are still on.  They'll still be there.  It's an act of God.  That's what they'll say. 
[00:40:30]  It's an act of God.  It's not a failure on their part.  Sometimes, you know, not getting your bill in on time is an act of God and not my fucking  fault.  But that's what they'll say.  They'll say it was a little hard.  But it never works the other way, doesn't it?  Correcto, Mundo.  Never.  Never.  They're providing a service and you don't have the service.  So, you know, you should be able to do something about that.  Thank you for your service.  Maybe you guys do things a little differently down there than we do up here because I don't  think it's that way.  But then again, my lights only flickered.  New York is a motherfucker when it comes to everything. 
[00:41:00]  They just nickel and dime you to death.  Yes, they do.  A bunch of taxes, fees.  No one walks around with change in the city, man.  No one.  Because it's taken away from you as soon as you leave the fucking house.  Yeah.  This place stinks.  They nickel and dime the shit out of you.  Syntax.  This tax.  This blah, blah.  This service charge.  It's insanity.  Really is.  How's Iraq?  Is he in?  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Iraq, what happened? 
[00:41:30]  How did you get it to work today?  A lot of people wondering how he got in, if the county came and cleared those giant fucking  log flume size pieces of lumber.  We'll make this fast, Iraq.  We'll make this fast.  He's like, we don't have two and a half hours to kill others today.  Just an update.  Iraq, update.  The county came and moved it.  Moved the branch?  Yep.  And later in the afternoon, they came and put my power on.  Oh. 
[00:42:00]  So you were able to get out and help your family?  Yeah.  Did you go and help the family?  Yes, I did.  Where'd you go?  Breezy Point and Bell Harbor.  How'd it look?  Horrible.  Oh, man.  Where are the pictures?  Throw up Apple TV.  I'll show you.  Oh.  Well, yeah.  I would love to see the pictures from Iraq's view.  Apple TV.  Apple.  Oh, there's some.  Wow.  Okay.  Wow.  That's fucking sad.  Can I see Sam instead of just enjoying it like at your house?  In between people's houses, a lot of water.  Oh, no.  Did you tweet this shit, Iraq?  No. 
[00:42:30]  This one.  You tweeted this one.  Wow.  Oh, just the one on that one, yeah.  Boy, those people ain't got no backyards, huh?  In Breezy, no.  All the streets are just sidewalks.  I mean, even before.  Yeah.  So.  So wait, what is that?  That's your neighborhood?  That's where my sister's, that's my sister's neighborhood.  Oh.  So she did all right.  She got a lot of.  Considering is what I'm saying.  Considering her house is standing, we don't know how the foundation will last.  And.  Yeah, that water was probably up.  Two blocks away, 110 houses were all leveled and incinerated. 
[00:43:00]  So each of these backyards, what's normally, they're just sidewalks, you said?  They're just sidewalks in this community, yeah.  Yeah, which is kind of cool.  So they're just looking at each other all day on the backyard porch?  And Jimmy's like, I don't think I'd like that.  No.  And your neighbor's just like, hi, neighbor.  I'm going to go out in the yard.  Hi.  Jesus.  You again.  Right next to my face.  Yeah, but then they got the nice beach over there and stuff.  Yeah.  Where they used to.  Now the beach is somewhere else.  Yes, it is.  Yeah.  How are they going to, like, clear all that sand? 
[00:43:30]  It's just amazing.  Travis went back to his place yesterday.  And.  And the amount of sand.  There's three feet of sand on the road.  Wow.  Like, the road is now.  Three feet.  Three feet of sand.  Let me show you.  So how are they going to clear that?  And the water level was up to what?  Where you like.  Almost your top of your head.  Yeah.  Hang on.  I'll put a picture.  You could see the mud mark on the side of the.  Like, the tide mark on the side of the buildings.  And it was up about as tall as Travis.  What's that?  What's that?  What tunnel they're looking at?  Still got water in it.  Brooklyn Battery? 
[00:44:00]  That's probably Battery.  Battery and Hudson and Midtown still have water.  Midtown Tunnel is fucked.  Midtown got water too, huh?  I don't understand how.  I don't either on that one.  It's underwater.  I know.  It's always underwater, right?  Yeah.  See, they just open the top and push it back in.  Yeah, come on.  Get it out of there.  Just blow.  That's how high it was.  Oh, yeah.  That's how high it was.  See the mark?  Wow.  It's like up to his eyes.  What a ghoul you look like.  I know, right?  I'm walking around, you know.  Oh.  Is it making you depressed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You really don't see how bad it is until you actually go there. 
[00:44:30]  There's the boardwalk.  Are you going to stay there?  Not right now.  We can't.  No, I know that.  I mean, are you going to like try to find another place to live?  No.  Or are you going to try to stick it out?  There's no reason to not go back.  I mean, Travis and family are staying at the now freezing Chateau Cumia.  It's cold.  Oh, fuck.  It's getting cold.  It's getting there.  Yeah.  Brr.  This was outside the apartment.  Somebody bought like a generator and everybody is just charging.  Oh, wow.  That's so cool.  Yeah.  A lot of wires.  I was going to say that's so cool. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  What I mean is I've.  No, I know exactly.  When I see stuff I've never seen before, I guess.  Yeah.  Wow.  That.  I was saying when I saw that picture last night, if you looked at that picture years  ago, you'd be like, what is that?  Right.  Why?  What is that?  Like a big thing of wires and little fucking rectangular things that people need.  Why?  Yeah.  This is how much sand.  Phones are so fucking.  When you're in a situation like this, like blackout and shit like that, it's so weird  because it was almost like having attachment on your utility belt. 
[00:45:30]  You need a flashlight.  You got it on your phone.  You're walking around with a flashlight and then you need to communicate.  You need to get news.  Like it's all right there.  It does make these situations a little easier to deal with.  We can't figure out solar energy.  No.  Sorry.  Something about that doesn't seem right to me.  I know Bill just educated the shit out of me, but.  Wow.  Look at that.  Yeah.  That's how much sand.  Three feet of sand just on the street.  Up to the middle of a fire hydrant right there.  We're walking back to the car, bringing stuff.  And I tell my daughter, I'm like, all right, hold my hand while we're crossing the street. 
[00:46:00]  She's like, we're not on the street.  It's the sand, silly.  No, you have no idea what's going on here.  I hope you administered some serious discipline for that lack of respect.  She's going to grow up to be a problem kid if you don't show some.  Don't let her talk to you that way, Travis.  I think in this situation, you can't just put it back to how it used to be.  No.  I don't know.  How are you going to get all that sand off the road?  What is that right there we're looking at?  That's a lifeguard station.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[00:46:30]  I think it's collapsed.  Yeah, but they don't build those, you know.  Yeah.  They're just kind of there.  Those type of things.  That's your neighborhood?  That's flimsy.  Is that your building behind it?  No, my building.  I'll show you my building.  It kind of looks like that, though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you close to the water?  Yeah, I'm a half block from the water.  That's like fucking...  Laszlo apparently stuck it out on Long Beach and just...  What a lunatic.  I know.  Did he catch a few waves?  He probably surfed.  That lunatic?  He's a nut.  But he actually had to come up to a certain point north on Long Island to update his webpage 
[00:47:00]  because he has no power, internet, nothing down there.  No cell phone service.  So he drove up a little north on Long Island, posted something on his website, and went back  down.  But he's...  How's his house?  It was just...  Long Beach is completely devastated.  Of course.  Yeah.  That's where we went for...  Yeah, for Amy's party.  We bumped into him that day.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were all down there on the beach having fun.  Wonder how bad her mom's placed.  I'm going to see Amy tomorrow. 
[00:47:30]  I'll ask her.  That was right on the beach.  Right on the beach.  Right on the beach.  We walked from the pool to the fucking beach, and it took us a minute.  It was nothing.  Oh, forget it.  Yeah.  Aw, little Riley.  She's having fun.  She doesn't know.  She's just smiling.  Well, I hope you tell her to quit having fun, and you explain the fiscal damage.  Yes, that's what a child wants to hear.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It's sad that this is the economy being ruined.  Wow.  Wow.  She just yells at me all day, and I have no idea what she's saying. 
[00:48:00]  Get out or get away, probably.  What did she say yesterday?  She goes, you're a butt licker?  She goes, you're a bum sucker.  A bum sucker.  She's just putting two words together.  Yeah, she goes, you're a bum sucker.  Oh, Jesus.  Wait a minute.  I should leave my door closed.  Yeah, Anthony's wondering, what is Kweepy?  Why does she call me Kweepy?  Kweepy.  That's the back of our building right now, which is about five feet of water.  Wow.  Man. 
[00:48:30]  And there's people that live down there in those windows?  Yeah, the super lives down there.  Oh, well.  Which really...  Do you like him?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's great.  His apartment's ruined.  Gone.  Yeah.  Man.  Yeah, you're on the fifth floor, so you're right.  I'm on the fifth floor.  But yeah, we went back yesterday, and everything in our apartment's okay.  Would you have spoiled food or not even?  Yeah.  I mean, we cleaned out the...  That was our traffic yesterday.  Oh, man.  Go back to that.  Go back to it.  That was yesterday coming onto First Avenue, trying to get to the 59th Street Bridge.  It was infuriating. 
[00:49:00]  At that point, I popped over the curb and the median as quickly as I could, so I didn't  have to merge.  Once that railing to my left disappeared and it was a cement-like median, I jumped right  over it and became part of the problem of merging.  So wait, let me ask you.  That median, right?  That's First Avenue and what?  That's coming out by the...  Don't tell me.  By the fucking...  By 40th?  UN, around there.  Yeah.  Somewhere.  Yeah, so I came down there and when we made that turn and I looked down first, I almost 
[00:49:30]  started crying.  Dead stop.  Just fucking...  Knowing that it was going to be hours before we even saw the bridge.  It was about 10 to 12 minutes a block, at least.  At least, yeah.  Just insanity traffic.  And that's not rush hour, by the way.  That's 10.30 in the morning.  No, that's fucking...  That was the morning.  10.30 in the morning.  That was the morning!  A lot later than 10.30 because it took a long time just to get there.  Oh, just to get to that point.  I tried to go down 57th at one point and then that wasn't moving 56th and I just kept 
[00:50:00]  going down, down, down to 40th.  I was going the opposite way I needed to go because nothing was moving.  You guys should just stay in the city.  You got a place here.  I can't.  Why are you dealing with that?  I had to be home.  There were things that needed to be done.  And you got to protect your shit from looters.  Protect my shit.  Keep that generator running.  Keep my fucking house alive, active.  Shit like that.  Make sure the taps are good.  Make sure you're out of beer.  Make sure that... 
[00:50:30]  Well, I went out on a beer run last night when I...  I'm on bottled beer.  I went down to the gas station.  I got some gas.  The owner said...  Come on, bottled beer.  The owner said...  He's roughing it.  The owner said he had one to one and a half hours of gas left.  I'm praying I don't have to go to cans.  In his tanks.  And he's not getting his delivery for three days.  And those were the only two gas stations that were open.  The one that I was getting gas at had signs up.  Finally said no gas.  There was another one just packed.  Packed with yelling people.  I got intel this morning from the cabbie. 
[00:51:00]  And according to the cabbie, he said that the Hess line is three hours.  It's not that.  He said it's from 30 to 45th...  It's like six blocks, but it's three cars deep all waiting for gas.  Whoa, man.  And he said that what happened was the stations where the gas comes in from, the trucks can't get it.  They can't get to it.  Because that was damaged, and that's why.  Hopefully that'll be fixed soon.  Yeah.  They said that part of the quandary also is there's gas stations that have gas in their tanks with no power.  And then gas stations that have the power and no gas in their tanks. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  So figure that one out.  I've been saying to everybody, it's a real comedy of errors.  And they've been going, that's a great way to put it, sir.  And then they punch you in the face.  Yeah.  What the fuck does that mean?  Comedy of errors.  Yeah.  Easy, madam.  Oh.  What is this guy talking about?  Hoboken got destroyed.  They're dry.  So the evacuations, they have essentially ceased.  That's the good news.  But the bad news is the power is still out, and people obviously getting a little bit cold.  Them just right now down into the 40s.  Now, yesterday morning, this was also...  Yeah, Hoboken got...  Hoboken got clobbered, man.  Jersey got fucked. 
[00:52:00]  It's amazing.  Hoboken.  Jersey got fucked.  It's right on the other side of the river.  I don't have enough fucking gas.  I'll make sure...  I mean, my sister's doing okay.  I think my family is too, but I can't even go into Jersey, because I've, like, literally...  I remember the night before the storm, I'm like, I should probably get some gas.  I have no gas.  Where are they living?  What happened to their homes?  Everything good?  Yeah, yeah.  They're okay.  That's the one thing.  Mom and Dad's home is okay?  Yeah, I haven't talked.  My sister said yes.  I texted them.  They just don't have power like everyone else?  Yeah.  It's all about the fucking gasoline right now, man.  Out on Long Island especially.  And I like the people.  Enough of your fucking suggestions. 
[00:52:30]  I'm, uh...  Let me tell you, Anthony, here in Westchester, I got a station.  There's no lines.  I was like, yeah, I'm not in fucking Westchester, you dunce.  I know.  There's places in Medina, Ohio that are great, too.  Yeah.  There's no lines and plenty of cheap gas.  Sorry.  I'm in Nassau County, dickwad.  With the bumper-to-bumper traffic, by the time you get to Westchester and back home,  you'll be on empty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, enough.  Enough giving me suggestions of where you live, where the gas stations are really nice.  You know what you gotta do?  What?  You go there, you buy some extra gas. 
[00:53:00]  You put it in your hand.  You put it in your pocket.  Can we go to break?  Yeah, our food's here.  It's nice and warm.  Let's eat warm food this morning.  Fill up your hands with gas.  Jesus.  I've been eating hot dogs off my grill.  Oh.  Fucking terrible.  They are.  Oh, I just cooked up some hot dogs outside of my grill last night.  Well, you must be chanting hot dog burps and cranky ass.  And fucking beer.  Bottled beer.  Oh, man.  You've been inconvenienced.  At least you gotta grill it.  That's just like eating bread and butter as you search for your loved ones. 
[00:53:30]  I'm not in the least saying it's bad.  I'm just doing a bit.  It is a little inconvenient.  I'm just doing a bit.  I know.  It is a little inconvenient.  Well, everyone has their level of inconvenience.  But the truth of the matter is, with the generator going, the amount, like, every day I plug  in a little, another little thing, another little light or something.  So the house is lit up really nice.  We have every bit of television and internet.  It's not interrupted at all.  On demand, cable, everything.  And plenty of food, refrigerator, all that shit. 
[00:54:00]  I know people will twist this shit, but I really, really liked seeing Romney and fucking  Governor Christie fucking get along.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You mean Obama?  What did I just say?  Romney.  Oh.  Romney, wow.  Oh, wow.  No, I know, because I'm used to Christie and Romney.  Yeah.  Christie basically fucked over Romney by, like, doing this.  He just wants to take care of Jersey.  You know what, it shows you what kind of guy he is in the end and what type of leader  he is.  I like Governor Christie a lot more right now. 
[00:54:30]  And people are like, well, they're purposely doing that because, well, it just was nice  to see that you got Christie and Obama walking pretty much hand in hand and dealing with  this shit together and not politicizing the shit out of it.  They took the little helicopter ride on Marine One.  You think Obama was a little scared that he had Christie in his helicopter?  He had three of his aides actually taking a bus to catch up.  All you saw was the pilot of fucking Marine One slamming that fucking tail rotor over  trying to keep the thing level. 
[00:55:00]  Everyone stay on this side.  Christie, look out that window.  He's got to deal with his humpty dumpty body, though.  He's so fat.  Dude, his fucking back is massive.  And you don't realize how it just goes round.  So fat.  After his belly button, the whole thing just goes round.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With these little fucking legs sticking out.  I saw from the back, they showed him talking to Obama, and he's like a giant egg man.  And then Obama has like a Chris Rock ass, all just skinny and shit.  Obama's got one of those skinny asses.  Christie's great because you get the impression he really does give a shit about his state, 
[00:55:30]  you know?  Right.  He's going above and beyond.  This is one of those kind of Giuliani situations for Christie.  Yeah.  He's the guy that's, he's the face of Jersey's recovery.  He's getting the president there to look at the damage and get to the federal funding that  they need to rebuild.  He's coming across as a good leader, albeit a very fat leader.  And telling the people he doesn't give a fuck about the election.  No, politics or the election or anything.  Somewhere Romney's crying like, but you have to give a shit right now. 
[00:56:00]  October surprise.  You were looking for it.  Obama will get a bump for this.  Yes.  He will get a fucking bump in the polls for this.  But in states that really don't matter.  So we'll see.  Yeah.  It's going to still be very interesting, but it's, it's really good to see the two sides  working together.  We need a lot more of this in this country.  Disasters.  So they work together.  Well, that's about the only way.  You know what?  I know.  That's what someone tweeted.  They said, unfortunately, it takes a disaster to get these two sides working together.  And that person was absolutely right, because it'll go back to business as usual after this 
[00:56:30]  shit.  Do you like when people talk about their state, like their state people are special?  Let's show them that the people of New Jersey know how to rally.  It's like any state would say that.  We from New Jersey are, we're a resilient people.  We will rebuild and bounce back because New Jersey has, it's like, that's what everyone  does.  What are they supposed to do?  Is there a state where everyone just lays down and goes, ah, ah.  Lays down and just dies? 
[00:57:00]  We here in Maine need help, because as you know, we are spineless, and we never bounce  back.  We are jellyfish.  You're so right.  The people of Nebraska will take all the aid we can get, because we are faggots.  We cannot take a disaster.  We can't do anything on our own.  We lay down and die.  We don't have a will to live.  Well, we're going to rebuild, because that's what America does.  I heard that a lot.  America rebuilds. 
[00:57:30]  But look at that.  Handshake.  Yeah.  A little pat on the back.  A little pat on the back.  Did you see Christy kind of calming that hysterical woman that was crying and had nothing, and  Christy's got his arm around her, and she's just weeping and weeping.  Oh, it was terrible.  If he goes for the presidency in 2016, this is really going to help him.  He showed his leadership during Sandy.  He helped rebuild New Jersey.  Yes, and then they'll show his opponent.  Well, his opponent was shoveling sand onto children. 
[00:58:00]  They'll show a picture of the guy with his kids.  Oh, no.  Look at the hurricane.  He's throwing sand on kids.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  You got that clip?  Maybe after the break.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  Let me see, Sam.  I can't see you.  We're having fun.  Governor Christy helping out the devastated people.  His giant hand.  Jersey.  Yeah, his big fat hand on her shoulder as she weeps.  He's probably squeezing it saying, shut the fuck up. 
[00:58:30]  You're making me look bad.  Governor Christy touring the most devastated areas of his state.  At one point, he takes a moment to console an upset resident.  Upset?  Listen.  She's a little more than upset.  We're trying.  Because I can't.  I can't do anymore.  I know.  I know.  Where's your husband at work?  He's a person.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I'm helping kids.  Yeah.  Well, first thing you have to focus on your connection.  No, it's not even that.  I just want everybody to get help finally. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Well, we're going to try to do this.  That's four years for you.  Because these houses don't deserve it.  Yeah.  Like, this is their house.  Oh, she's hysterical.  Everything's gone.  Pull it together.  Yeah.  I've never had water in my house.  Yeah.  This was the worst storm that the state's ever seen.  Wouldn't it be great if Christy smacked her?  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up.  I want to see everything.  I want to see everything.  All right?  And then he just walks away.  I want to see everything.  Well, he just shook her and said, shut up, liberal. 
[00:59:30]  Walks away and goes, thank God.  That's over.  Oh, God.  Someone tanned this woman.  Right.  Jesus.  You hear that crazy bitch?  Yeah.  That's horrible.  Yeah, the mic is over.  He's like, Jesus Christ.  I thought that bitch was never going to shut up.  Oh, man.  Imagine how high he, from the height of where he is now to the bottom of the barrel fall  that he would take.  Orby said, I kept trying to get her knuckles to bump my cock while I grabbed her shoulders.  Holy shit.  Her breasts felt nice.  Yeah.  She has some nice tits.  Oh, God.  But, uh, there you go.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Let's eat some food.  You know how you were doing the state thing before about the different states?  How come nobody in, like, Nevada says we got nothing but, what, are we even going to gamble  or something?  Like I said, why don't we just go to break?  Well, go ahead.  Come up with a better one than that.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Serious XM.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  We used to rape Will Fouts just to make him break character because he would never, he 
[01:00:30]  dressed up as a character for, like, two straight weeks.  It was so annoying.  It was so annoying because you're like, Will.  He's like, I'm not Will.  I'm Ron Burgundy.  Like, let's go.  All right.  Well, Ron, can we talk?  He's like, I'm busy this week with art.  And so this went on for weeks and weeks.  And Tracy, you can never pronounce his name right.  He called him Pharrell.  Will Pharrell.  Hey, Will Pharrell.  He'd be like, let's play characters and break Will Pharrell.  Let's rape him.  Me, Colin Quinn, and Tracy repeatedly raped, like, fake raped him for hours.  We'd leave him in a dumpster, take his clothes off, and he would never break character. 
[01:01:00]  It was so obnoxious.  Will would be, Tracy would be in the doorway as we're fake rape, as we're literally pulling  his pants out.  Tracy would be in the doorway with an unlit cigarette going, hurry up and save me some  of that.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.

[01:03:00]  Go hit by a dog with a rabbit tooth.  She's back to your eyes.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony Show.  We had a little, I guess a little miscommunication with time or something.  We thought we had a little more time because we just finished eating.  And Opie and Jimmy are out of the studio.  They had to go pee-pees.  They like going together.  Like a couple of what they call bitches.  You ever go to the restaurant, and you got a couple of your bitches that are at the table, 
[01:03:30]  and one gets up to take a piss.  What happens?  The other one goes, I'll go with you.  What are they doing there?  Why do they go to the bathroom together?  I don't get it.  I like when you get observational.  Yeah.  That's what I do.  Some of that observational humor.  Yes, Mr. Rock.  In case you wanted to know why I'm playing this song.  Uh-huh.  Nirvana released Unplugged 21 years ago.  Holy fuckstick.  Wow.  Really?  That was a good one. 
[01:04:00]  That pretty much was the, wasn't this like the birth of the Unplugged, really?  They were doing it, but this is the one that made it, put it on what they call, made it what everybody wanted to do.  Right.  Because LL Cool J did it before them.  How did LL do a fucking Unplugged?  Jay-Z did an Unplugged.  Ah, shut up.  But that was way later.  Way later.  What do we got today?  Who's this RZA guy?  RZA's Wu-Tang.  He's a legend.  He directs films, too.  Is he?  Yeah.  Does he?  Hey, there he is.  Mr. Florentine. 
[01:04:30]  Well, the one guy who's a big fan isn't here, so.  What's that?  The one guy who's a big fan of RZA isn't here, so.  Who's that?  That would be Troy Kwan.  He's a huge Wu-Tang fan.  So he was booked on the show for Troy Kwan?  No, I'm just saying.  Is that what it is?  It's nobody else knows.  Because to tell you the truth, and I know I'm terrible with this, I don't remember approving a Mr. RZA.  I don't remember approving RZA for the show.  But he's coming in.  He's promoting The Man with the Iron Fist.  What's going on?  I guess that's, um, Russell Crowe is in that one? 
[01:05:00]  And Lucy Liu?  Yeah, it's like an old school martial arts kung fu movie.  And Kung Li?  Yeah.  Fucking Kung Li, man.  You knew who Kung Li is, right?  I have no idea who Kung Li is.  He's a great fighter, man.  He's a great, uh...  But who's Kung Li?  I was actually excited to see his name.  No, you weren't.  I was.  He's a UFC fighter.  He's a fucking...  Oh, is he?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, but he spells his...  For some reason, he spells the name of the C.  I thought it was a K.  And, uh...  Like King Kong.  Bob Kelly loves him, too.  Of course he does.  Loves who?  Kung Li.  Kung Li, who's in this RZA's movie, The Man with the Iron Fist. 
[01:05:30]  Russell Crowe's in it.  Lucy Liu.  It's one of these...  It's a real fucking flick.  Wow.  It's one of these things.  It's a real movie, Jack.  I love when he says that.  It's a real film, Jack.  And he's the director...  RZA's the director and development and champion of the Hip Hop Chess Federation.  What the fuck is that?  Dude, I had no idea that existed.  Oh, man.  Does the bishop come up and blindside punch the king?  He lays on the ground, and then all the pawns jump in and stomp his head, and they steal 
[01:06:00]  his cell phone.  They're probably...  Not to be fucking completely racist, but a lot of those guys are probably really good  because they play in jail.  A lot of guys from jail play fucking great chess.  Jesus Christ.  They do.  Is that it, really?  Yeah, a lot of guys in jail do.  Make a shank out of the fucking nice...  No, they also do.  Yeah?  No idea.  We're going to learn some shit today.  I guess we are.  He's involved with that?  He started it.  So, I gather he plays chess.  Are you going to talk chess with him, Jimmy?  He probably won't want to talk chess with me. 
[01:06:30]  Why?  What am I going to say?  He's got a fucking foundation thing like that.  All right, quick.  What do you think?  The horse or the bishop?  Go.  I'm going to ask you these boring chess questions.  I go with the bishop.  Who would you rather jerk off with?  Fisher or Kasparov?  Maybe he'll play chess with friends with me.  He hasn't canceled?  No.  Wow.  No.  He must be local then, huh?  He used to play New York guy.  Yeah.  Jim Florentine.  How are you, Jim?  In studio.  I just came here to use your power.  I see that.  You just plugged in everything.  I'm charging everything. 
[01:07:00]  I got my computer.  Florentine's charging everything.  He's not here to radio.  He's like, fuck.  I just need outlets.  Now, Jim, you had a car.  You drove in today.  So, you had to get in before the 6 o'clock, right?  Yeah.  So, which way were you coming?  Which crossing?  A Jersey crossing.  Lincoln Tunnel.  Lincoln Tunnel.  Okay.  So, they're doing this three people per vehicle or more in order to come in after 6.  And you did exactly what everyone else was doing. 
[01:07:30]  Come in early.  So, the traffic is still fucking crazy.  Were you surprised the traffic was so bad?  Well, at 5.20, yeah.  It was like a 15-minute wait at Lincoln Tunnel.  Yeah.  5.20 a.m. to get in.  Wow.  So, yeah.  I was in about like 5.20.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was sitting early.  The traffic lights, it was beautiful.  I got to the city in like 28 minutes.  Usually takes me 50.  Like, this is fucking great.  It should always be like this.  It should be like this always.  It's survival of the fittest when there's no lights.  You get these fucking people that sit there and won't go and they're very timid. 
[01:08:00]  And then there's, you know, you give a look and you fucking go.  Keep going.  You don't think the cops will pull you over for that shit?  You know.  Cops ain't doing shit as far as like writing you up for blowing a light or a non-light or anything  like that.  That's why.  Or driving over sidewalks.  Like, I don't think I'd get a ticket for that.  Your wife and kid are there, though.  Are you bringing them with you to do a gig this weekend or no?  Like, are you worried about leaving them there?  No.  Fuck them.  They're on their own.  No power, though?  No.  Yeah.  We got, uh... 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  My wife's actually coming with me.  My son's going to go with the in-laws.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  We got no power.  Yeah.  For like 7 to 10 days, we're out.  Yeah.  Are you finding things to do?  No.  I got to read something from my brother really fast.  See, my brother's very different than me.  He goes...  We asked him how he's doing because he's got a tree on his house for real.  I got a tree on my house.  There's no rain, so he doesn't know if it's going to leak or not.  But it's a massive tree on his roof.  So they're sleeping downstairs in the living room.  And we asked him, how are you doing? 
[01:09:00]  He goes, we're doing fine.  No power for at least a week.  But we're having fun with it.  Playing cards and board games.  And watching movies by...  They call board games for a reason.  And watching movies by candlelight.  What?  Kind of enjoying it for now.  He's got three kids.  He's got an eight...  What is he got?  An eight, a six, and like a three.  Wow.  And he's enjoying it without power.  That's a guy...  But that's the way to do it, man.  If you can have that mentality, it's either that or you're going to fucking murder somebody on  the street.  Right.  But he's actually enjoying it. 
[01:09:30]  It's like, yeah, it's kind of fun.  What's he eating?  I'd be out of my mind.  I don't know.  I didn't ask him.  No, you can get...  We got a grill, a gas grill, so we've been grilling stuff.  Oh, yeah.  It was left in the refrigerator and freezer.  And grilling.  But it's weird not being able to look at your phone.  Yeah, I have to go down to the Home Depot like three miles away to sit in that park  a lot.  For some reason, they get service there.  Oh, yeah.  Bad cell service.  So then you check out your shit and then go back to the house.  Go back to the house, charge, sit in the car, charge.  But isn't that weird?  Because we're so attached to our phones.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You can't do...  There's nothing. 
[01:10:00]  And my son wants to watch a movie.  We got it on the iPad.  We charge that up.  And you can watch like one a day.  Yeah.  But he's out of his mind, too.  Oh, that's terrible.  He's yelling for a movie.  I'm like, too bad.  Wow.  But once it gets dark, yeah, then they all want to, you know, because the in-laws are  there, too, and they want to play board games.  Come on.  You want to play Cranium?  I'm like, no.  No.  No.  Fucking grown, man.  How about Monopoly?  I go, I played that when I was 11 the last time.  It just starts fights.  I don't need to fight with no fucking lights on. 
[01:10:30]  We don't got to sleep in the basement, so there's nowhere to go.  Why sleep in the basement?  Just because, well, especially the first two days with trees falling on the house.  I had a big tree fall in my yard.  Oh, fuck.  Like an hour into the hurricane, so.  Yeah.  It's scary, right?  Yeah, I got huge trees all around.  The whole, my whole block was devastated.  And just pulled wires down.  Pulled wires.  No wires at all.  The one that fell by my house that took my power out, it snapped one of the telephone  poles, and the transformer was at the top of the pole, which is now, the 
[01:11:00]  snap part in the guy behind me's yard with just a giant tree laying across and wires  everywhere.  Is it still laying there?  Oh, yeah.  That shit ain't fucking moved.  No one's even come to look at it yet.  Yeah, no one's come, yeah.  This is going to take a good month before most people have their power back.  You ever play SimCity where you put up a power station and you got to feed power to  the little houses and businesses that you put up?  And then after a while, you start getting that lightning bolt signal that means you got  to build another power station because that one can't handle everything you're doing. 
[01:11:30]  That's the point I'm getting to.  Because every day I'm finding more power strips and extension cords.  So I'm just plugging more shit into my generator.  Right.  And I'm realizing it's going, BAAAATS!  I'm screaming at you.  Now it's like screaming because I just keep plugging more shit in.  In the refrigerator, fucking a 500-watt light that's in my living room and kitchen.  I got one light.  See, it's a choice.  You can put a bunch of little lights all over the house or one giant light that lights  the whole fucking downstairs up.  I opted for the one big light.  And then the refrigerator, I got all my routers, cable boxes, TV, and shit so I could watch TV 
[01:12:00]  and actually get cable and internet service, station for charging everything in the house.  So I'm using a lot of power.  Your whole life is like an adventure thing when you're a teenager.  Yes!  It's like an adventure game when you're a kid.  Yes!  Your aunt's just always going to find a way.  That's the fucking...  It is.  I want to tell Florentine what's going on with us.  Oh.  Didn't lose the lights.  Oh, no.  I know.  I heard above you and Jim, you didn't lose either, right? 
[01:12:30]  Nah, but it's a weird shit.  We haven't been inconvenienced at all.  That's not true.  I'm trying to find things that I've been inconvenienced with and I have nothing.  Nothing.  At the gym, the fucking locker has not been as well kept because there's less people.  Yeah, no.  We've been very lucky.  We've had nothing.  No problem.  Do we have fresh oranges in our gym?  We did, yeah.  All right.  Fresh oranges.  So we're still not inconvenienced.  Fresh fruit.  Fresh oranges are still coming in.  And the Starbucks is open around the corner from you guys?  Starbucks is open.  Everything's good?  Our whole neighborhood is lit up.  My building shook.  That was about it.  I got seasick. 
[01:13:00]  That's the only story I got.  Fucking building moving back and forth.  I got nauseous.  Me and my wife and my kids were like, what the fuck's going on?  I thought the gas was on because I thought we were going to pass out and die because we  were lightheaded and dizzy and all that shit.  And then we figured out that, holy fuck, the whole building is moving.  That's all I got, though.  That's my story.  That's it.  People are trying to find where their houses floated to and that's all I got.  Tuesday morning, well, Tuesday afternoon, I went to this Wegmans supermarket, waited two  hours for a cup of coffee, a hot cup of coffee. 
[01:13:30]  No.  People were miserable.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You waited two hours for coffee?  Yeah.  I wanted to get out of the house.  I'm like, what am I going to do?  So, yeah, I just went in there.  We shot.  Got a little, you know, some shit, but I just waited on the line for two hours.  You're a coffee guy like me, right?  You need that coffee.  You never did before.  I'm surprised.  Are you into coffee now?  No, I've been into it for a while.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  You don't have instant coffee just in case?  No, we didn't.  What?  What are you going to do?  I got a fucking carrot machine.  I just threw the thing in.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Now I'm chopping wood.  I'm raking leaves. 
[01:14:00]  Chopping wood yesterday.  I'm raking leaves.  You're pawingles now.  I know.  Shit you've never done in your life or maybe when you were a kid.  Man, my father-in-law was like, you got to chop it like this.  I'm fucking chopping wood.  I was like, why?  I don't need this skill.  No, but I got two fireplaces that are just going constantly.  Yeah, it's getting a little chilly at my house.  I was trying to figure out a way to hook the generator up to the fucking oil burner,  but that's a lot of power.  I can't do that.  I met the neighbors for the first time.  I've been there a year and a half.  Yeah, I came over and knocked on the door and was like, could I charge my laptop here? 
[01:14:30]  Really?  Because I guess he saw all the lights on in my house.  I was like, yeah.  And then I didn't even invite him over to hang out in the power for a little while.  He took his laptop through the letter slot here.  Give me that.  You would have a beer with anyone, but not your neighbor?  Invite a man.  He just didn't seem like he wanted to hang out.  I thought he would have wanted to be with his family.  Are you still charging his shit?  He hasn't come back.  Yeah, because he knew that he wasn't invited.  He came back to get his laptop, though, and he looked at the helicopter on the table. 
[01:15:00]  He goes, what's that?  It's like, oh, it's a drone helicopter.  Did you look through his laptop?  No, but I did not.  You've got to snooze laptop.  If it's sitting there, you've got to, right?  Of course.  You have to.  I would never leave my laptop unguarded.  Oh, man.  That's going to take three hours to charge.  That's all right.  I'll just sit here and watch it.  I'm fine.  Yeah, that's good.  Oh, yeah.  I'll charge it up for you there, Mr. Glitter.  What else, Jim?  I have a Mexican that does my lawn, but they don't text Mexicans for some reason. 
[01:15:30]  No.  I can't make a phone call, so I'm trying to text them to get over to do some leaves, cut  some wood, and then I went down to the 7-Eleven.  You usually pick them up at the 7-Eleven, get them for like 50 bucks a day.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  They just wait outside.  There's like 40 of them.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, but they're not out.  I don't know what the hell they went.  Wow.  You know what?  You lead me into something else.  We got a cleaning lady, and she texts my wife, but she doesn't know how to speak English 
[01:16:00]  that well, so I guess she throws it through a translator.  So my wife's like, hey, how are you doing?  And she wrote back, I hope that you are also good, which is, that's perfect, but then it  gets bad.  I thank God and very well not step here, nothing wrong, I think, because up to now, not out  A.  It's an actual text for my cleaning lady.  Yeah, that's great.  That's an actual text for my cleaning lady, and she thinks this is completely acceptable.  Sure.  Because I guess she does the Spanish and just throws it into some kind of fucking filter 
[01:16:30]  online, and that's what comes out.  Do you know, I didn't, until you said that, I have the same cleaning person as Oak, and  I didn't realize that, I just read a percentage of her things, but she wrote to me on the 29th,  29th, hi Jim, tomorrow do not think that you can go to clean your apartment, but if on  Wednesday the time is already better, I.  She thinks she's communicating, I don't know what she said. 
[01:17:00]  I guess that they enter it backwards.  She better get her ass over to our apartments today, or she's fucking fired, I'll tell you  that, Jim.  Absolutely.  Man.  We don't take more shit.  My place is getting a little fucking dirty.  A little gamey?  A little gamey.  Yeah.  And you got a newborn, if your lights went out.  You'd be...  Four weeks old.  And this one's a little different.  This one likes to cry a little more than the first one.  Just give me a heads up there, Mr. Florentine.  You have more?  I would assume you would.  I don't know.  You might?  We'll see. 
[01:17:30]  You get the one, you want the two.  Not for a couple more years, though.  You get the two, you want the three.  I don't care if they've got to hang out.  What siblings ever got along?  All they do is fight their whole childhood, and then eventually in their 20s they kind  of make up.  Me and my brother got along.  Right?  That's all they do is fucking fight.  No, we got along.  Me and my brother are barely a year apart when we get along.  Me and Joe fucking never fought.  I don't think we ever fucking fought, me and my brother.  We're 12 and a half months apart.  Yeah, like crazy.  Close.  Yeah, but when you were kids, ask your parents about that.  I'm sure you guys were.  We definitely had like the kid things where you just pick on each other and shit like 
[01:18:00]  that, but it wasn't this.  Not like the Irish fucking brothers where they're punching each other in the face.  Fucking fists are flying in those Irish families.  No, we did all right.  Me and my brother, Scott.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you got like six other brothers, too.  Yeah.  One of seven.  And then, yeah, some other ones you don't get along.  My other brother, he's right behind us, too, but he always stayed in his room with  the shades down.  It's really strange.  I get along with him, though.  Right.  He's just always a little different.  Yeah, there's always one weird one in... 
[01:18:30]  When you have a bigger family.  He was a Dungeons and Dragons type of guy while we're outside, you know, playing army  and shit.  He was a little different.  Continues to be a little different.  Is he on Broadway or something now?  No, I don't...  Not that different.  I know he's on the West Coast somewhere.  I don't really know.  I've lost touch.  San Francisco?  I don't know.  Oh, no.  He's...  No, he's not.  He's not.  I got a stick of form.  He's not.  No, he's out there with a girl, I guess, but I don't know where. 
[01:19:00]  That happens in families, right?  Sure.  Does.  Big families, especially.  And you have a few people in the family.  Yeah, you lose touch with a few here and there.  Yeah.  Then they come back around, then you lose touch with a few others.  I got a weird family, Florentine.  What do you want from me?  You get along with all your brothers?  Yeah, we got seven.  There's seven of us, too.  Wow.  All boys?  I always forget.  No, three girls.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Three boys.  You're almost like us.  We were five and two.  Five boys, two girls.  Imagine that. 
[01:19:30]  So, you're chopping wood.  Chopping wood.  Seven o'clock, it gets dark, and then you're down in the basement, and they want to play games.  Yahtzee.  What kind of lighting?  You play Yahtzee?  No.  What kind of lighting?  Do you have candles?  You don't play any of the games?  Yeah, we got candles and flashlights.  No, it's awful.  So, what are you doing?  Just hanging out.  My wife's like, you want to have some deep, meaningful conversation?  I go, why can't we just sit here and just be alone in our own thoughts and just be quiet?  Right.  And just think about our lives. 
[01:20:00]  To yourself.  And not say anything.  And how lucky we are.  Yeah.  Why not?  You don't want to talk all the time?  No, because she goes, she saw my eyes closed like eight o'clock, and she's like, are you  going to sleep?  I go, I never go to sleep at eight.  She's like, oh, because I just wanted to, I didn't want to yammer, you know, because  I saw you, I go, why would you yammer to begin with?  Why would you yammer any?  Should I just feel like talking?  There's nothing else to do.  I go, let's just sit here and just think of our own.  Are you guys all sleeping in the same room?  Yeah.  Near the fireplaces, probably.  Yeah, but we're upstairs now. 
[01:20:30]  No more trees are going to fall in the house.  We're back in the mess.  Oh, you are.  But the first couple days, we're all downstairs.  Just in case a tree falls.  Yeah.  And you're not into the board games that are happening?  No.  I haven't even heard of cranium.  What is that?  Which one is cranium?  I have no idea.  I don't know either.  It was Yahtzee, Monopoly, they had like nine boxes.  I fucking hate board games.  So do I.  They're terrible.  I just started the arguments.  I said, Monopoly, I go, it's just going to be a huge fight.  We're going to have nowhere to go.  I would like Monopoly, though.  I always did well.  I hate when you play Monopoly, though, and people go like, oh, no, let him go past there. 
[01:21:00]  Don't take the...  Oh, he'll be out of the game.  Let him stay.  It's like, no, the object of the game is to break the motherfucker.  Don't get all pissy about someone landing on my hotels.  Eh, fuck them.  Her and her sister, they always fight, so they were going to play Yahtzee together.  I go, all right, we have to...  Before you guys even fight, no one's going to...  Within a half hour, you guys are going to be screaming, and someone's going to leave  or sleep in the car tonight.  I know that's going to happen.  How do you fight with Yahtzee?  It's like numbers. 
[01:21:30]  It's not a figurative game.  Because what other issues they have come out during that game.  So I said, look, no one's going...  As soon as you guys are going to...  She's like, we're not going to fight, I swear to God.  Within 20 minutes, they're screaming at each other.  Wow.  Is her sister older or younger?  A year younger.  She's single?  Yeah, she actually is.  Would you allow Jim Norton to date your sister-in-law?  Of course.  I don't care if he dates my mom. 
[01:22:00]  I'd care less.  I want to see him more often.  Would you allow him to date your own sister?  Absolutely.  I don't care about that.  That's a true friend, Jim Norton.  I know, but I would feel too...  First of all, he knows his sister wouldn't.  But I'd feel too guilty.  I would feel too guilty because it's Jim's sister.  I couldn't.  His sister-in-law I could go out with, but his immediate family or...  Yeah.  I just would feel too guilty.  And none of my sisters are over five anymore, so they probably wouldn't.  A couple of them had a good run.  They dropped down a few numbers over the years. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  So, but yeah, her sister just turned 30, Lindsay.  Is she good looking?  Yeah.  Hmm.  What do you think, Jim?  I see a fucking...  I see a reality show.  Yeah?  Two Jims and the gals.  That's what we'll call it.  Two Jims and the gals.  Are people fighting in your neighborhood?  That's not that bad.  But they're getting on edge.  We have a three-day rule.  I think people are cool for three days, and then...  And then all hell breaks loose.  Then it's going to start getting really ugly out there. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Their patients are, you know, running thin.  And it's kind of getting up to there.  If the infrastructure doesn't progress enough to a certain level in those days, people start getting antsy.  So the amount of antsiness is directly proportional to how well they're putting the infrastructure back together again.  Yes.  But if they go three days without things like gasoline and food and heat and shit like that, electricity, then things get a little ragged around the edges and people start rebelling, getting a little rambunctious. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  I think the next couple nights are going to get down to the 30s at night.  Yeah.  And people are running out of gas for their generators.  Yeah.  If you're going to get a generator in the future, buy like 18 gas cans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seriously, everybody has one gas can.  It's stupid.  It's got like three gallons in it and it has to get gas.  And then you hear a storm's coming, fill all fucking 18 and put them in the garage.  The fucking Escalade smells like the fucking...  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I was trying to think of the guy that blew up the fucking Oklahoma City. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  You're saying he smells like Timothy McVeigh's fucking...  Yes!  ...his garage.  Right.  Or Timothy McVeigh's...  Oh, fuck.  How about it smells like Terry Nichols fingernails?  Yes.  There you go.  Because with the amount of gas cans, you're right.  You got to get a shitload.  I get a fuckload of gas cans.  I pull up to the gas station.  I don't try to get my truck online because there's a lot of people in the streets.  I park at like the place next door to the gas station, grab up all the gas cans, walk  over the gas pump, plop them down, hand the fucking guy that's running the gas station 
[01:24:30]  a 20 and then go, could you fill these up?  He gets right to it, fills them up, I pay him and I'm fucking done.  How do you do your car, though?  How do you get the Escalator?  I haven't had to gas my Escalator up yet because I gassed it up right before the storm.  But I'm going to have to grease the guy for that, too, at some point.  I guess Good Morning America is over the storm.  What are they doing?  Karate chopping a shark?  Yeah.  Some woman karate chopped a shark?  So I guess they're done with the storm, huh? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Storm's over.  Storm's over for those people.  It's funny if she had no arm.  She karate chopped a shark and then fucking bit her arm off.  It was an Asian woman.  What a shock that she did a karate chop.  It's funny.  She said that she had delivered his food and he didn't want to tip her.  Both Scott and Mariko, thanks to some quick fists, lived to tell their shark.  Where do you karate chop a shark, you think?  On the nose?  No.  Yeah, probably.  Can't get him in the neck.  Does it have a nose? 
[01:25:30]  Looks like it has a nose.  Oh, yeah.  It has a nose.  That's the only place you can hit it.  They always say punch my nose.  Only about a dozen.  Almost.  Wow, they don't really give a fuck about this storm that hit the Northeast, huh?  No.  There's still plenty of stories to be told.  And GMA's saying, fuck that, let's move on.  No martial artists had been sent.  So I'm thinking me and fucking Jim might be brother-in-law someday.  Yeah, I see an excitement in your face.  I do.  That's pretty cool.  I don't see Jim enough either.  It bugs me.  So it'd be cool. 
[01:26:00]  We'd do family functions.  Yeah.  I'd get weird calls.  Family dysfunctions.  Yeah.  You're bringing the stuff for the grill.  I'd be like, come on, man, I don't know.  She's a cool chick, too.  Her favorite band is Rush.  And I'm like, there's no chick that's over a six on a scale of one to ten that likes Rush.  No.  Let alone be your favorite band.  Wow.  We went to the Rush show a couple weeks ago in Newark.  That was her 30th birthday.  We took a lemon air.  It was great.  They were amazing.  When Getty's prettier than the girls that are there, it's a problem. 
[01:26:30]  I'm saying a lot.  Yeah, I would bang Getty out of all of them.  Yeah, but that's her favorite band.  Oh, yeah, she's like eight and a half.  Does she like the new Rush?  Yes.  She still is.  The new one.  A lot of people loving the new Rush.  We played the one song.  We didn't get into it, to be honest with you.  I didn't mind it.  I didn't mind it either.  It was all right.  People were like, you've got to hear it.  This is amazing.  I didn't feel like it was amazing.  You ever hear Limelight?  Guy who has nothing to say.  You ever hear Limelight?  They were good, huh?  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  It's heavier, the new Rush record.  Yeah, they were great.  They played like two and a half hours.  They're taking an admission.  Not too many bands do that.  Wow.  For like 20 minutes.  How's Getty's voice?  Great.  They play like an hour and ten, taking an admission.  What's up with his voice, you think?  And Neil Peart on drums.  Holy shit.  Amazing.  What does Getty Lee do to keep that voice going like that?  Because that's such a unique voice.  You can't hit those fucking notes, huh?  It's a high fucking...  I'm sure he's still hitting those notes.  Yeah, he's hitting those.  Absolutely.  I don't know.  There's something they're doing with the voices these days to help, like enhance their voice.  It's not a tape, but there's some kind of a mix that's running in the mix. 
[01:27:30]  Like Ozzy sounded a lot better these days, too.  There's not a tape playing.  He's not lip syncing at all, but there's some kind of enhancement.  They can fuck around with the mics a little bit more than they used to do.  That they're doing, yeah.  Favorite band is Rush.  Favorite band is Rush.  I like that.  I know.  You like Rush, right, Jimmy?  I love Rush.  Oh, there you go.  They're not my favorite band, but I do love them.  You're in.  I don't know.  They've put out a lot of albums, huh?  Yeah, every like 18 months they put one out.  I think I tapped out after Roll the Bones, as far as New Rush goes. 
[01:28:00]  They got a built-in audience.  They sell out everywhere they go.  They tour like every two, three years.  Huge fan base.  They love it.  Yeah, and they put out an album like every 18 months.  I wonder if they do that intermission thing.  That's obviously a big liquor maker, money maker for the venue.  To rest.  Maybe they're at the age now where they kind of need to rest a little bit,  but I also wonder if they're getting money for that because the 20-minute intermission  is a gigantic fucking liquor sale for the venue.  But I think it has a lot to do with the fact they have a lot of songs that are long, too.  So I don't think they have a choice. 
[01:28:30]  They've got to play longer shows.  Yeah, they play like an hour and ten, take a break.  Yeah, they try to do two different sets.  They did a lot of new stuff the first hour and ten minutes of the show  and then old stuff the second half.  But they just like, we had Getty on our show when he was saying that.  He goes, I go, what do you do during the 20 minutes?  He's a big fantasy baseball fan.  And so he's like, I'm checking my stats on my laptop.  You hate fantasy sports.  Did you attack him for it?  No, I didn't.  You hate fantasy sports.  What did you say?  Yeah, I know you sell out.  You probably went, oh, that's cool.  That's cool.  Well, not too many people play fantasy baseball. 
[01:29:00]  It's more to football.  That's true, yeah.  Yeah, the baseball games are just on and they're just, you know, they're there.  I don't mind it that much for football.  That is funny.  Can I ask you one football question?  You can ask, yeah.  By the way, I want to, everybody gave me shit when I made a jet prediction  in the beginning of the year that they would go like seven and nine,  somewhere around there.  Six and ten, seven and nine, maybe eight and eight.  Now they're three and five.  The team's a disaster.  They're going into Seattle in two weeks.  There's no way they're going to win that game.  So fuck you, everybody that gave me shit. 
[01:29:30]  Fuck you.  They're going to go ten and six, eleven and five.  Okay.  Why isn't, and let me finish the question because it's a little long.  Why won't Rex Ryan put, because he's a queer, 10 Tebow in?  And a lot of people have said to me, well, you think he's the answer?  I don't think he's the answer, but it would make it a little more interesting  for the fucking fans.  Rex Ryan refuses to put him in.  I was at the game with the Dolphins this past Sunday.  The game was completely out of hand and he's staying with Sanchez. 
[01:30:00]  What's that about, you think?  The Dolphins sit there.  He's trying to get him tough or something?  He knows that once he puts Tebow in, the season's completely over.  Oh, really?  He's got no shot of winning, of going into playoffs.  Because you can't go back to Sanchez once you put Tebow in.  He's going to play at least four games until he gets hurt,  or he's just, you know, completely sucks for them to put Sanchez back in.  That's why Philly hasn't taken Vic out either.  Right.  He's having a bad year?  Yeah, he's having a bad year.  All the year.  Andy Reid wants to yank Vic too, but he knows. 
[01:30:30]  There's still what?  Yeah, like three and four or something like that.  So they're still kind of in it.  They could still make a run.  Even the Jets at three and five could still go nine and seven  and maybe make the playoffs at nine and seven, possibly.  It depends.  So Rex's not giving up yet.  When they're three and seven, if they lose the next two,  I think they'll go to Tebow because they'll know the season's over.  Sanchez stinks.  He's better than Tebow.  No, and I can't argue that point.  You're right.  That's what I do with the coaches.  The coaches see these guys play in practice, so they know who's better.  So that's why they have no shot with Tebow. 
[01:31:00]  Sanchez has skills, but he doesn't have that fucking heart.  He panics all the fucking time.  Yeah.  It matters.  But I don't think Tebow's going to do it.  They know he's going to stink.  Do you think Romo's having a good year?  Christ.  The Cowboys are the worst team to watch.  They just fucking break your heart at the end every week.  What are they right now?  I wouldn't know.  Cowboys are what?  I think they're two.  Are they three and five?  No, they might be four and three or three and four. 
[01:31:30]  No, they're under 500.  I'm pretty sure.  Oh, yeah.  They might be.  Jesus.  I think they're three and four.  Wow.  So.  All right.  So I think when the Jets get to seven or eight losses, three and eight,  four and eight, four and seven, they'll put Tebow in.  Well, the Jets should just trade Tebow.  They could get something for him.  They're not going to get anything for him.  Before his stock is completely useless.  No, you won't get anything.  But then how do you go back to Sanchez next year?  He's still under the contract for two more years with a big salary.  Sanchez stinks.  So how do you go back to him next year after you put Tebow in? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  All right.  You answered the question.  But they should use him more.  They should have him in the wildcat and let him throw a little more  instead of just running into line for three yards.  Three yards every time.  And then he jumps up like he won the Super Bowl.  But I love that excitement the guy brings.  That Tony Sperano, the offensive coordinator,  he's the one in Miami that had the wildcat.  But it wasn't his wildcat.  It was the quarterback coach, this guy David Lee, who's in Buffalo now.  He's the one who came out with the wildcat.  He had that in college.  Sperano doesn't know how to run that.  That's why your offense is a disaster, too. 
[01:32:30]  It's horrendous.  Yeah.  I said the people are going to be asking for Schottenheimer back by the end of the year.  Yeah.  Cowboys are three and four.  Three and four?  Yeah.  And they're not going to beat Seattle.  It's the Jets.  That's a tough place to play in, Seattle.  So three and six.  Fuck!  Are you happy to see that?  Yeah.  Congratulations on the Giants, too.  Jim's a big Giants fan.  I thought he was.  Oh, San Francisco Giants.  It was beautiful.  I kept wanting to text him at the worst time.  I don't care. 
[01:33:00]  I was texting during a game.  I just wanted to text you.  Hey, did you get a few minutes to talk?  Like, fucking eighth inning.  Fucking tied at three.  Had a few questions before you, but showbiz.  Someone's saying, look what Tebow did with the Broncos.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the league's figured them out, though.  That's the thing.  A lot of these.  Look at Cam Newton.  A lot of these guys come in the first year, rookie year, and they play great, and the league  figures them out.  Someone like a Belichick or somebody does some studies on him.  Oh, that's what he's doing.  Yes.  My point is this.  They brought Tebow in, which fucked with Sanchez's head, obviously, and then they don't use 
[01:33:30]  Tebow.  Well, that was Woody Johnson.  They should have never taken him.  That was your owner.  Woody Johnson is like the next Jerry Jones.  He loves publicity.  He wants to be on the back page.  Right.  He wants everyone talking about the Jets and Tim Tebow, because they can't sell tickets  anymore.  So you've got to assume Rex Ryan never wanted him.  No, he didn't want him.  But Woody just said, look, we're taking him.  Too bad.  Jesus.  He just wants everyone talking about the Jets, in which they are.  Every week on ESPN, that's all they talk about is Tebow.  The guy plays three plays a game.  I know.  I could care less about him.  I mean, he had an interesting, fun part of the year last year. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, he's not that guy.  He's not going to be that guy consistently.  He's like the Asian fella in basketball.  Ah, Lynn had a good game last night to start off.  The Asian fella.  Jeremy Lynn.  The Asian guy.  He had 12 points and 8 assists.  Yeah.  So mad that the Knicks just couldn't figure that one out.  I became a Knicks fan last year after taking about 10 years off, and now I'm not a Knicks fan.  Everyone loved the whole fucking Lynn Sanity thing.  He brought me back, brought a lot of people back.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  And then they can't figure out how to fucking, you know, keep him.  Roland couldn't buy the shirt quickly enough.  Well, the contract he wanted was outrageous, but they got a bargain with what he brought  to the team for the two or three months.  Two months, I guess.  Well, how's he doing with his new team?  First game.  He had 12 points, 8 assists.  They should have kept him just to fill the seats there.  Of course.  Asian smart.  They would have made that money back.  You buy, you sell it to the Asian market.  The whole Asian market around the world would be Knicks fans.  That's how that shit works. 
[01:35:00]  Love what you best get the boat.  Very good sport to watch when Jeremy Lin prays.  He prays again.  Yeah.  Big round ball.  That's why they always get like a Rabu.  They always say the smart business man.  One Ichiro.  One Japanese guy or one Chinese guy.  You get that entire population in the world watching your team.  Dude, they're showing the games in like China.  It's just a huge interest.  And that's got to be worth a few bucks. 
[01:35:30]  Who gives a fuck they piss off the rest of the players on the team?  They should have just paid them.  Jim, did you enjoy watching the complete deconstruction of the Yankees during the playoffs?  That was unbelievable.  See, that's why I knew the Tigers were going to be no threat to the Giants.  Right.  Because the Yankees were pretty much like a t-ball team at that point.  Nobody was hitting on that team.  So the Tigers looked amazing.  Like, holy shit.  They were favored in the World Series.  I'm like, the Giants are going to roll right over them.  And they did.  Yeah.  Yep.  It wasn't even close, obviously. 
[01:36:00]  It was so depressing to watch.  You know, it kind of softened it, though, because there were no expectations.  After a point got reached with the Yankees, there was no expectations that they were going  to win this.  It was just like, oh, okay.  I'll watch the games, but I'm not like, yeah, come on.  It just was done.  And you knew it.  You felt the heart go out of the fucking team.  It's amazing how that whole lineup went.  Nobody could hit anymore.  Nothing.  Nothing.  The whole lineup.  Not one guy.  Amazing.  Everyone fell into a slump at once.  But then you get guys on the Giants, like this guy, Marco Scudero, who's been around 
[01:36:30]  for, like, years.  He's 38 years old.  And Angel Pagano played for the Mets last year.  And these guys turned into superstars in the playoffs.  These little role players.  These little scrubs.  It's just amazing what going to a different, better team will do to some of these guys.  You know, only 12 million people watch the World Series.  That number seems really low.  Every year it's the same thing.  No, last year it was 16, and that was a seven-game series.  Right.  It just seems like more people used to watch the World Series.  Because there's no interest in Detroit, really.  Like, San Francisco's a bigger city, but it's like, you need... 
[01:37:00]  That's why they always want, like, L.A. and New York to play, just because they get  interest from all over the country.  People aren't interested in Detroit, especially.  That's true, yeah.  12 million's not a lot of people, though.  It was Saturday night.  It was game, I guess, game three.  It was, yeah.  And I was off, and I was calling all my friends that aren't even comics to come over and watch  the game, and nobody wanted to come over and watch a World Series game.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're like, nah.  Wow.  And we used to watch every single World Series.  It didn't matter what teams were in it.  It was just really exciting, right, as a sports fan.  Not so much these days. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, it's kind of boring in three and a half hours.  Then you've got to listen to Tim McCarver, that fucking idiot.  You don't like him?  You don't like McCarver.  He's terrible.  He's a legend.  He's fucking stink.  He's got to go.  He's senile.  He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Every time someone hits a ground ball of short...  1967, off Bob Gibson, a guy hit a ground ball of short, and the first baseman dropped  it.  You remember that show?  He's like, nah, I don't, Tim.  Buck just tries to talk over him.  He just keeps talking, because he's like, don't... 
[01:38:00]  Because McCarver just says something completely stupid.  I thought of you because they showed the girl in the ninth inning.  You're right.  Fox always does that shot of the worried chick.  They didn't do too much of it, because the Giants were just dominating the whole time,  even though the games were kind of close.  It wasn't too many shots of praying.  I did see one.  It was so annoying.  No, the playoff game, what was it?  The St. Louis playoff game?  I think that was the one where they showed people that were just devastated. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, that was when they beat the Nationals, and they were down 6-0.  Yeah, yeah.  Those are good shots.  I got no problem with that.  But you don't need to show, game two, your team's up 1-0.  No one needs to see anyone praying in a second inning.  1-0.  Yeah, yeah.  I love your take on sports.  It's so fucking stupid.  They're just showing people watch the game.  I'm fucking home.  I know.  I understand.  There's people in the stands.  I don't need to see some guy fucking sitting there on his cell phone.  Just sitting there.  Why do you go to that shot?  I want to be in that fucking director's. 
[01:39:00]  I want to be in there, in that room, and go, what the fuck did you go to that shot for?  You got 14 monitors in front of you.  You pick the shots.  Stop showing Joe Girardi just to stand there doing nothing.  If he's got a reaction on his face, then go to him.  Go to Joe.  Look, he's pissed.  He's just fucking standing there.  Stop showing him.  I know what he looks like.  He's not doing anything.  Do you like seeing all those empty seats at Yankee Stadium behind him?  Oh, it's the fucking greatest.  Unbelievable, right?  Because the Yes Network hides them.  They have camera angles where they hide them during the season.  But when they show them on Fox, when it's on Fox or TBS, forget, you see them all. 
[01:39:30]  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  And all the Yankee fans are like, they're in the, you know, getting food.  I'm like, yeah, really?  Yeah, they just paid $2,500 for these seats.  No one's going up to get a hot dog.  They're getting it served to them.  That's sickening, isn't it?  All that much to charge that much for those fucking seats is disgusting.  They deserve it to be empty.  $1,250 at seat.  Oh, they're nice seats.  Amazing.  And then like $800 behind first and third base.  That's why all those seats are wide open there.  When you're not paying for it, though, those are nice seats, man. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, man.  When it's in your own private area with the food, all free.  It's great.  Oh, it's great.  It's like, who wants to look at that?  Like, who wants their team to have fucking, in the playoffs, empty seats behind fucking home plate?  It's Yankee Stadium.  It's a dumb design for the stadium.  Every other stadium is packed.  You watch the playoffs.  Every other stadium does not want to.  They probably could have moved those seats somewhere else, a little bit higher, so it's not always empty, you know, field level.  They're probably paid for already, though, aren't they?  Yeah.  Aren't those seats paid for by, like, Sony or whoever? 
[01:40:30]  No, no, no.  A lot of them, no.  Oh, no?  They're not.  Oh, you don't think so?  They were assuming more people would just pay that price, huh?  Yeah, they were thinking that everyone was going to pay them.  They started out $2,500 a seat when they first built that stadium.  Within, like, three months into the season, they lowered them to $1,250.  A seat.  They cut them in half.  For one fucking game below me.  So imagine you want to bring your chick to a game, sit behind home plate, $5,000.  $5,000, yeah.  For a fucking game in May against the Royals. 
[01:41:00]  Who's doing that?  Yeah.  Maybe for $500.  Yeah, maybe $500.  Just so you can say you sat behind home plate.  So the Yankees just give those tickets to StubHub, and then they try to sell them for whatever, and they get a kickback from StubHub.  Right.  How much do they usually sell them for?  I don't know.  They're way lower than that.  You can probably get them for, like, $300.  So everyone thinks they're getting a deal.  Right.  The Yankees just want to unload them.  Yeah.  We can make something for it, right?  Fuck.  That was embarrassing.  Why don't we break?  What are you promoting today there, Mr. Florentine? 
[01:41:30]  I'm going to be in Fort Worth, Texas this Friday, Saturday.  Hyenas.  Texas.  Hyenas.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hyenas?  Yeah.  Hyenas.  You ever heard it?  Laughing Hyena?  I know.  I just love the name of these clubs.  It's got to be a, yeah, the comedy club's got to have some laugh angle.  I've been there for a long time.  It's my first time at the club.  I've never heard of it.  I thought you were in Levity Live, Roland said.  I was like, that didn't make sense.  They're not going to have any fucking power.  No.  And then, no, I'm not.  No, but I'm in Point Pleasant next week, and I don't know if they're going to have  power there.  The whole boardwalk got wiped out.  Point Pleasant.  Oh, fuck, there's luck there.  I think the whole club got wiped out.  No, the club's, like, about a mile off the beach. 
[01:42:00]  So it might be good enough.  You might do well if people need something to do.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that's next week in Uncle Vinny's.  And then St. Louis, November 15th to 17th to 5 o'clock.  Well, we got people down there.  Is Uncle Vinny still standing?  Because Point Pleasant and...  Shit, yeah, man.  It's Point Pleasant and Seaside.  Seaside got fucking wrecked.  And supposedly Long Beach Island, but we haven't heard yet.  LBI in Jersey?  Yeah.  Got it bad, too, huh?  Yeah.  Because the Long Beach on Long Island also got fucking destroyed. 
[01:42:30]  What was that gig in Long Beach Island you used to do?  Wasn't there one down there that fucking...  Yeah, it was right over the bridge.  Yeah, it was a...  Was it a Monday night?  Yeah.  It was a big...  Who fucking booked that?  Do you remember?  Artie.  Artie Fletcher.  Oh, it was Artie Fletcher.  Okay, cool, cool.  Yeah, it was awful.  That was a time where...  I was in there, like, the early 90s, and this girl thought I was Bon Jovi because of  long hair.  And, well, my brothers were fucking with it because they were at the bar.  She said, is that Bon Jovi?  I was just talking to somebody, and my brother was like, yeah, that's him. 
[01:43:00]  And they were egging out.  Really?  What is he doing here?  He's like, hey, he's got a house here.  She comes over, and my brother's like, she thinks she's Bon Jovi.  She comes over, are you John?  I'm like, yeah.  Next thing I know, I'll make an hour in the parking lot.  She's like, I saw you at the Meadowlands.  I'm like, yeah, great.  I guess not too well.  Then she invited me to a barbecue the next day because she wanted me to meet her son.  And I had a call.  I didn't want Bon Jovi to be an asshole.  So I had to call her and say, look, I can't make it.  I go back in the recording studio.  Oh, I thought you were going to say you weren't Bon Jovi.  No, no, I didn't tell her that.  Wait, to this day, she thinks you made out with Bon Jovi? 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I said, put your son on the phone.  So I talked to the kid.  He was like, eight.  And he was like, I love those slippery women.  I'm like, yeah, thanks.  That was my favorite album, too.  Sheesh, sheesh.  But I couldn't go to the barbecue because then I was going to get busted.  Of course.  So I would be like, that's not fucking Bon Jovi.  The second you walked in.  I know.  Who do you?  That's not Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi?  That's awesome.  That's really.  The Quarterdeck.  It was called The Quarterdeck.  The Quarterdeck Club, man. 
[01:44:00]  Fuck yeah.  I don't know The Quarterdeck Club.  She thinks, she's been telling people since 92 that she made out with Bon Jovi.  Meanwhile, he was married at the time.  That's wonderful.  That's fucking great.  But at least I had the decency to call the next day and say, I couldn't come.  And then I said, put your son on the phone.  Then just not showing up.  Yeah.  Or showing up and ruining the whole thing.  Imagine that.  Do you know how humiliated she would have been?  Mama, is that not him?  You know, she called all her friends.  Bon Jovi's come to our barbecue.  Oh, man.  They're all waiting. 
[01:44:30]  They're all waiting.  Oh, he canceled.  She had to go out and go, oh, guys, everyone gather around.  Bon Jovi's not going to make it.  Yeah, he had to go back to New York to record.  To record.  But he said hi, and he got on the phone, and he talked to my son.  And the kid didn't even notice him.  Mama, why does Bon Jovi sound like a monster?  What happened to his voice?  He sounds different.  He kept saying beautiful, complaining about the Giants.  Jovi hates fantasy football.  When we get back, we're going to change gears and discuss this. 
[01:45:00]  What's going on, brother man?  Hey, well, the moral decay of our country continues.  Madonna's got a rug read.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Now it's all coming back to me.  You remember?  Yeah.  Yeah, because I didn't know what that was when I read it.  Hey, I ain't saying if he's stressed out down there, but rumor has it.  The kid drove out in a Buick.  I guess that's curse man. 
[01:45:30]  This is a bit that we used to do back at AAF when we first started together.  Why does Florentine have to be here today?  It's embarrassing.  What do you think?  Did you just hear that?  Did you hear how Obi picked up the phone?  I certainly did.  I didn't even know who the hell it was.  I thought it was like some black.  Now you hear the brown mother passed off cigars after the birth?  Really?  Yes, he even smoked one.  I bet I know where.  That was Ant. 
[01:46:00]  Doing that voice.  Yeah, I'm doing that.  What's going on, brother man?  I'm doing a voice.  What's going on, brother man?  It was a character called Curse Man.  See, and...  What's going on, brother man?  Oh, and what Curse Man would do is, you know, I would call, and I guess I would say things  that were...  What's going on, brother man?  I would say things that were kind of, you know, naughty.  Naughty.  You know what would be really douchey?  What?  What?  If during the Curse Man call, at one point you hear Anthony talking as if he's not Curse 
[01:46:30]  Man.  That's clever.  Oh, we were trying to, like, fake it, right?  What's going on, brother man?  Oh, brother man.  So you were a regular character that called into the show?  Well, I was on the show.  It wasn't even like I was just a calling guy.  Oh, so you pretended that you were a caller.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I went into the...  Now, did you go back to your voice halfway through the call?  Like, man, he's crazy.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe that's how it played out. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember what I would say.  I don't really...  You're going to find out soon.  And you guys tricked the fans?  They really thought this guy was on the phone?  I wonder.  Some listener?  I wonder.  I don't know.  I wonder.  I wonder what they thought back then.  Maybe they were just too embarrassed for you to think that it could be a...  That must be a caller.  Oh, God.  I don't really remember this one.  I don't really...  I don't know why.  I don't really...  I sort of have...  I remember it, but I have no detailed recollection of the jokes.  I don't know.  The lack thereof. 
[01:47:30]  You don't know why you don't remember it?  I can take a guess as to why you would block that one out.  Not very memorable, probably.  Well, we're going to...  I guess...  We're going to go down memory lane next.  Am I talking about Madonna having a baby?  Is that what that was all about?  I really don't know.  I think I had no idea.  I caught wind that Madonna had a baby.  Wow, that's how long ago that is?  Do you remember if you wrote a script?  Were you reading from a script?  Oh, probably.  I probably wrote...  Yeah.  Back then, I used to actually put some effort in.  We used to write shit back then.  Put some fucking effort into that show.  How weird is it? 
[01:48:00]  We used to write shit.  That's strange.  Like I'm sliding in at six.  Fucking leave at ten.  Blow me.  I got here before you did.  Yeah, exactly.  All right, we'll do this.  Because we were doing Jocktober before the storm hit.  Oh, I love that stuff.  I know that messed up that whole world.  But we always finish Jocktober.  With our own version of Jocktober, which is us doing horrible videos.  Jim was a Mr. Jocktober before you guys.  He used to make...  We used to do these gigs in like Connecticut and we'd drive. 
[01:48:30]  And he'd put frigging WPLJ on.  The Rocky Allen Showgram.  Showgram.  And he would turn it up when he would go...  You know, when he'd do like a ten minute bit of talk.  And he's like, come on, this is funny, isn't it?  He wouldn't let me change it.  The Rocky Allen Showgram.  You get it?  I hated it, though.  I know.  He hated it, but he loved listening to it.  He was so bad.  That guy was a monster in afternoon drive before we came around.  He was?  We destroyed him.  Yeah.  He's dead in real life.  I heard he had to retire because of health reasons, Jock. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, he can't walk anymore.  Was he diabetic?  No, spine problem.  He was always a really big guy.  Wow.  Huge.  You're a fat fuck.  A big guy, huge.  Fat fuck.  I'm not even saying that to be mean.  But I'm saying he was just a big fucking, big, big, big boy.  We used to have a huge black guy that did weekends at CMF in Rochester.  They had to hide the chairs.  One of my jobs on, I had all the dumb jobs on Fridays.  I had to hide all the stools because he was coming in to do his shifts on the weekend.  They went through so many stools, they finally started hiding them. 
[01:49:30]  He would just break the fucking chair.  He was huge.  I can't even, you know, Patrice was a big guy.  We all know that.  This guy fucking was way bigger than Patrice.  Not just fat, just massive.  And I forgot his name.  He had an amazing voice.  But one of my jobs back in the early days was to fucking hide the stools and lock them  in a closet every Friday.  Because he would do like two or three shifts every weekend.  How bad those stools must have smelled.  Oh, God.  He broke everything he sat on.  You ever smelled the seed of a fat guy?  He does.  Oh, man. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  We'll do a little Cursed Man and more storm coverage and more stories from Florentine.  And oh, we got RZA.  The RZA, yeah.  From Wu-Tang Clan.  You can't say RZA?  I don't know.  Sam?  No, no, no.  It's RZA.  Yeah.  I say RZA because that's what it looks like to me.  It's not initials.  Why isn't there an I in there then?  R-I-Z.  Yeah.  Because it's RZA.  I'm going to call him RZA.  Is that okay?  There goes Sway.  Sway talked to fucking the president.  Yeah, he did.  When?  Sway did a fucking interview with fucking Obama. 
[01:50:30]  Right before the storm.  A few days ago.  Yeah, right before the storm.  Nah, face-to-face.  Where?  Fucking MTV.  Oh.  A face-to-face video.  I mean, he fucking...  It's televised.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Want to see if Sway wants to come in?  No.  No.  Yeah.  Thank you, though, Kenny.  We don't care that much.  Exactly.  How about Obama?  Get us him.  Yeah, exactly.  Of those two people, Kenny,  he wants Sway.  No, we want Obama.  The Opie and Anthony Institute of Art and Literature

[01:53:00]  All the journeys of this great adventure.  We're hanging with Jim Florentine.  See, playing the song with the lyrics, it just doesn't work with our show.  It really doesn't.  Every once in a while, maybe, but we're just talking over Geddy Lee.  It's stupid.  It's good if the lyrics kick in at a certain point, but they can't start with lyrics. 
[01:53:30]  I know Jimmy wants to hear the songs.  It's not going to work.  We've got to go back to the rejoiners, and every once in a while, if there's a particular song we want to play,  a little bit, then that's what we do.  I like the ones that start with a lot of instrumental and then kick in on a vocal so we can talk over it a little,  but then the song starts.  Yeah.  Yeah, like a Godsmack song or something.  Right.  Love Godsmack.  Some of some heavy shit.  Or Metallica, yeah.  Love Metallica.  Right.  Just heard from my buddy Boris, who used to give me golf lessons before I started having kids. 
[01:54:00]  And he writes, I asked him how his family's doing.  He goes, yeah, having two kids and no power is tough.  My life is about driving around and make sure the iPads have power so the kids do not kill us.  I've been driving around since 4.30 a.m. powering up.  Jesus.  Oh, you spend the day powering up and...  Yeah, you jump in your car and fucking power up the iPads, but it takes forever.  Yeah, that power thing is fucking...  Wow.  That's a tree in my yard.  Let me see.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:54:30]  I got a tree in my yard.  Oh, yeah.  Let me see.  It went into the neighbor's yard, but good thing.  But it didn't hit anything?  No.  No.  Look, this is my road right here with all the trees down.  That's fucking wires hanging everywhere.  Jesus.  Everywhere, yeah.  You live in the woods?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jealous.  I don't want to be around people.  God damn.  I just want to walk in the woods.  Just in the woods.  Just walk around the woods.  A lot of bugs, though.  You got spiders.  There's rats, mice.  Nice.  I don't like the ski line disease. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, fuck the woods.  You don't like the woods?  Fuck the woods now.  I don't mind it, but yeah, there's a lot of fucking bugs.  What's the stink?  Fuck it.  Really?  Yeah, the woods do stink.  I don't want the woods anymore.  They're fun for the day, but to live in the woods.  Are the rats worse than the people in Manhattan?  No.  More mice.  Little mice.  Nah, that's easy.  Your kid goes out and plays in the lawn.  He's fucking bit.  By what?  Constantly.  Yeah, just bugs everywhere.  Just shit.  Bees?  Not bees, but like, I don't know, spiders.  I don't know what the fuck's out there.  Remember we used to do Lancaster?  And in Lancaster, the fucking gig, you'd stay in the back. 
[01:55:30]  The comedians, there was a little room in the back behind the parking lot where the  host in middle would stay.  The MC actually got to stay.  The headliner got to stay in the actual motel itself, the roadway motel.  But it was always infested with field.  But they were field mice.  It didn't feel as dirty because you were on a cornfield.  So it was like, you knew that they were field mice.  Field mice are easy, too.  Well, they're not as bad.  They don't feel as diseased.  They're a lot faster, though.  They're hard to catch.  Impossible.  Yeah, that was behind.  Impossible to catch.  That was a little like shack behind the hotel.  Yeah.  I remember this couple, when I was staying at, this couple pulled in at like noon, and 
[01:56:00]  he had to pull behind there and was fucking in the car.  That's hot.  Nice.  Yeah.  So I was watching from the window.  I whacked my bag.  Good for you.  Watching them.  Good for you, Jim Florence.  And that chick was a fatty, but I'm like, come on, this is live.  It don't matter if it's...  These have great food there.  When are you going to write a book?  You got a lot of these good stories.  You're going to write a sex book.  I got it written.  It's just nobody wants to publish it.  A sex book?  No, not a sex book.  Just a...  But not a sex book.  But these type of stories.  Yeah, well, they'll be included.  No, just do a whole book on that.  That's why no one's picking up your book. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  Yes.  In Canada, how the girl thought you were somebody else?  Nobody wants to know where I grew up.  No, no.  No.  No.  Go look.  I'll write the book about me growing up in comedy, but first I'm putting out the sex  book.  I hate that.  Whenever I read...  I don't want to know where someone...  Thank you.  I don't care where he went to school.  I mean, that shit.  I take out the first three chapters, move right to the fucking meat.  I'll give him 20 pages.  20, right.  If you can't do all that shit in 20 pages, what your grandfather did and how he came to  America before...  Yeah, who cares?  Yeah, I don't give a fuck.  I'll give you 20.  But the Peter Criss book, which is a very good read, 50... 
[01:57:00]  I think I...  What did I say?  52 or 62 pages before finally I took a phone call from Gene Simmons.  But he was...  I'm like, 62 pages?  I didn't mind that because he was in gangs.  Like, there was at least violence he was talking about.  The family stuff I never care about.  Yeah, but...  But there was enough violence in his life.  Do that in 20, 25 pages.  I'm good.  I'm with you for 20, 25 pages.  Yeah.  That's mighty white of you.  Well, fuck.  And then it's like the chapter ends with, and the phone rang, and it was Gene Simmons.  I'm like, holy fuck.  This should have been 20 pages ago. 
[01:57:30]  The chicken canada who thought you were a guy that you used to date?  Yeah.  That makes me very happy.  Wait, which one is this now?  It's just some girl who saw Jim, and he fucking pretended he was somebody else.  It was a creep.  But she thought she used to date you?  Yeah.  Well, she had a one-night stand with me, supposedly.  It sounded just like me, a total scumbag.  Me and Levy were in the strip club in Canada, and this stripper came up to me.  She's like, Curtis?  Oh, no.  And I'm like, oh, no. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Curtis from Winnipeg?  I'm like, yeah.  She's like, you remember me, Melanie?  I'm like, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She's like, you don't remember.  I go, you did so.  I always, you know, just the usual line.  Just your hair's different.  Yeah.  Because, you know, every chick's hair's every three days, their fucking hair's different.  That's fucking good.  That's good, man.  Just always go to that one.  Yeah, it's different.  You did something different with your hair.  Yeah, I know.  It used to be whatever.  And I'm like, oh, yeah.  She's like, you remember?  I'm like, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I haven't seen you in a while.  And she goes, and right away, she goes, you know what this asshole did to me?  And Levy's, you know, egging around. 
[01:58:30]  What did he tell me?  And supposedly I was in a band, and she went to see me at this club, and we hooked up afterwards  at Blizzard in Winnipeg.  And I went back to my place, and I told her she could stay there, because it was a blizzard,  no problem.  As soon as I fucked her, I told her she had to leave.  So she had to walk home in a blizzard.  Did you like Curtis?  Yeah, my Curtis sounds like me.  Curtis sounds like me.  I grew up in a blizzard, and she's still mad.  He's the Canadian Jim Florentine.  I love it.  So I just told her, I said, look, I'm sorry. 
[01:59:00]  I go, I had a roommate.  You know, she was a girl, and she was, you know, I knew she liked me, and she'd be really  jealous.  You came up with an excuse for Curtis?  Please.  I'm a professional.  You helped out Curtis.  That's fucking great.  Because it was the same excuse I would use.  Right, right.  So I just said, look, you know, she was paying most of the rent, and she would have definitely  thrown me out, and I knew she had a crush on me.  Wow.  But I didn't like her, so I really couldn't take girls back, and I feel really bad.  I still think of it to this day that I did that to you.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  Did you go home with her?  No.  Well, I invited her to a wedding, because we were going to a wedding in a few hours. 
[01:59:30]  I'm like, I need a date for the wedding.  But you would have to meet Curtis at the wedding.  Yeah, but nobody knew me, because we were in, like, Toronto.  So, yeah, we weren't in Winnipeg, so.  This is great.  But she couldn't get off work in time and stuff.  We exchanged numbers, but I never hooked up with her.  Did you mug it out with her, though?  Yeah, I think, but, yeah, before we walked out.  Yeah, before I left.  The best part of that story is when she goes, Curtis, you just know the game so well, you  didn't even hesitate.  Yeah.  I'm like, yeah.  Yeah, it looks different.  That's great.  The consummate professional. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, of course.  Always in it.  Fucking beautiful.  The line I remember from that, and you probably, you told me this years ago, was that you were  making out with her, and she said, it's still the same.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  And also, she started trashing Americans.  She goes, I hate when Americans come in here.  They're arrogant.  She goes, and there's stupid accents.  I'm like, me, and Levy's got a worse accent than me.  I'm like, really?  She goes, I could hear American a mile away.  Meanwhile, we're just talking like fucking two Jersey idiots.  She had no clue.  The greatest lie ever, this comedian, I won't say his name, he was married, and he was fucking 
[02:00:30]  around with his wife, and he had a condom, I guess, in his, like, sports jacket he wore  from the gig the night before.  So his wife wakes him up at, like, seven in the morning out of a dead sleep with the  condom right in his face.  She goes, what is this?  What is this?  And he wakes up, and he's like, what are you yelling at you?  You're cheating on me.  I found this in your jacket.  He's like, honey, I've been doing this bit on stage where I pull a condom out.  I use it as a prop.  She's like, when did you start that?  He goes, I just started that, like, a few nights ago.  I didn't even get it. 
[02:01:00]  You haven't seen it yet.  I just started doing this.  It's a prop that I put in my chest.  Out of a fucking dead sleep, it came up with that one.  It's beautiful.  What if she asked him to do the bit?  He would have made it up.  No, no, I'll give you his name.  This is hilarious.  I thought it was somebody else.  Jim will know him.  I don't know if you guys will.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know him.  Oh, yeah.  He's a pro.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What a professional.  Who is it?  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  Oh, that's fucking funny.  Yeah, I'll tell you. 
[02:01:30]  You probably won.  I don't know.  Maybe he'll know him.  Yeah, he'll know him.  Really?  I hope he'll know his name.  I can't really.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Professional.  I mean, of course I know the name.  I love the guy.  So he had to come up with some condom material.  She was hot, too.  In two seconds.  But I mean, for Zach.  That's pretty good.  Because she eventually had to see the condom.  Yeah, or maybe he just said he dropped it.  You know, it wasn't working.  But just out of a dead sleep.  If you can come up with something like that.  That's Leota with a gun in his face.  Yeah, Karen.  Fucking Karen on his chest. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's fucked up.  Well, we're going to wrap up Jocktober, Sam?  Oh, man.  Should we?  Oh, man.  I'm kind of bummed Jocktober wasn't as great as it was in past years.  How do you figure?  We got fucking sidetracked by a storm and all.  Yeah, the storm.  I mean, let's reflect on the month as a whole, not just the last week.  You know what?  Let's look back at one thing that was worth the price of admission to Jocktober right there.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house. 
[02:02:30]  There it is.  Thank God E-Rock's back.  E-Rock, I'm telling you, thank God you're back.  Sal was a complete waste in there.  Sal, what a waste.  How many times did we say, I got a tree on my house?  I got a tree on my house.  Sal didn't play it.  E-Rock, we're all good?  After yesterday's beating, Scott Shannon's a huge fucking radio star.  I hope he does a good clip.  Fuck.  Come on, man.  What did I say after that?  So what's up, brother man?  That's GP.  I guess we're not good. 
[02:03:00]  Darn.  I guess we're not good.  Darn.  He's fucking hanging you out of the dry.  Can you play that one again?  Darn.  Darn.  Darn.  Oh yeah, we did a whole fucking month on that.  Yeah.  So we're not good, E-Rock?  There's noise in here.  Come on, guys.  Yeah.  So we're not good?  Is that what you're telling me?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  All good.  All good.  It's all good.  He just hung you out.  I like soundboard Obi from the past.  It is cool.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:03:30]  E-Rock wrote me yesterday.  What did he write?  Well, he wanted to talk.  What are you doing?  Can you talk?  Well, he wanted to talk.  Guess what?  What were we going to talk about yesterday?  Wait, wait, wait.  I had a great excuse.  I had to go trick-or-treating with my kid.  Did you respond?  Yeah.  Oh.  I don't.  Oh, he writes, I don't suppose talking on the phone is possible, is it?  Why would it be possible, E-Rock?  Because you don't answer the phone for your family, so why are you going to answer that?  Oh, yeah.  Good point.  And then I wrote, getting my kids ready for Halloween, can talk later. 
[02:04:00]  And then I wrote, don't sweat today.  It was fantastic radio.  What?  Like he was worried about him underperforming?  I've heard, no, I've heard rumors that he was a little worried with the bosses and shit.  But that ain't happening ever, by the way.  He's worried about the bosses?  Yeah, because he thought the bosses were going to give him shit.  They didn't give you shit, right, E-Rock?  I may have to talk to somebody today.  Oh.  You're totally fine.  Trust me on that.  E-Rock's a made man.  Nothing's happening to him.  That's true.  Now we're in protect E-Rock mode. 
[02:04:30]  Trust me, you're fine.  He gave us two and a half hours of gold.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Unless your salary would be divvied up among us, then we're not going to protect E-Rock.  Then fuck him.  No, I'm not.  I want the world to know.  I will protect E-Rock.  You'll be fine.  Of course.  Watch his fires.  Yeah.  Watch his not here tomorrow, and we go, hey, Sal, you got that bit?  Oh.  Just forget about it.  Who wants to talk to you?  No, it's...  Wizard?  Yeah.  I talked to him on the phone a little bit yesterday.  Oh, my.  We're just going to talk about my situation. 
[02:05:00]  How about you ask him where he was the last day or two?  I don't know.  I thought he was here.  No.  He wasn't in here on Tuesday.  I'm very angry with you.  He has nothing to say.  Very angry.  He has nothing to say.  He should have been here Tuesday.  Yeah.  If he's running the channel, he should have got a hotel room.  So laugh at him.  Openly laugh in his face.  Go, where the fuck were you?  He can't talk to you.  He wasn't here.  I'm sure he doesn't actually want to talk to you.  I mean, Rob couldn't even get in here the last few days.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  Why couldn't they get in here?  They knew the storm was coming.  They should have got the hotel rooms.  Well, didn't they offer everyone else hotel rooms?  Yeah.  I don't think they're giving anybody a hard time about this stuff.  Like, Roland and Eric are both very nervous that they're, like.  Why is Roland nervous?  He's always nervous about something.  Yeah.  Poor guy.  Hold on.  Roland's coming in.  Oh.  Where?  He's coming from this way.  Hold on.  All right.  Oh, boy.  I wouldn't call that a big radio teaser.  No, I just didn't want to move on.  Shut up.  Darn.  Darn.  Are you nervous, Roland?  No. 
[02:06:00]  It's not a Roland.  If I was in the hotel, I can't get nothing approved until the next day.  Anything.  So, everything sells out.  Yeah, they've got to let you out.  But why are you nervous?  You didn't miss one day.  I know.  So, what could you be nervous about?  No, I just was nervous about finding a hotel and everything.  Oh, not the boss is.  He's nervous about just even getting a hotel.  We could have to get confirmation that he could get one in the car service.  Yeah.  But the guy that wants to talk to E-Rock didn't make it into work.  So, what could he possibly say to you if you have days coming?  Sure, there was some vagary.  We all explored that for a couple of hours. 
[02:06:30]  About the vagary.  But besides the vagary, what could he possibly say to you if you have days coming and you  weren't in here?  Well, I just called to make sure things were okay and he wants to talk face-to-face about  maybe the reasons why I wasn't here.  But he wasn't here.  Oh, man.  Come on.  I'll leave E-Rock alone with that.  But he wasn't here.  He could have got a hotel room like he suggested everyone else get a hotel room.  I don't know what he was doing.  I know I wasn't here and I know who I told and why I wasn't here.  I'm trying not to bitch and I'm up to a month.  But Mel Karmazin was walking through and taking notice on who made it in. 
[02:07:00]  So, if Mel can make it in, why can't the guy that kind of babysits the channel, why  can't he make it in?  I don't know.  And then this guy is going to now talk to you?  Yeah, right.  I don't think they're even going to have a look.  I would openly laugh at him if he even attempts to talk to you about it.  Do you think E-Rock is worried about nothing?  Yeah, I don't even think he really had to call him yesterday.  You've got to keep it real.  I know that this guy wants to talk to E-Rock, by the way.  So, I know it's a real thing.  I don't think it is.  Oh, man.  It absolutely is. 
[02:07:30]  The guy who fucking told me he's going to talk to E-Rock.  But he'll probably talk to him and say, like, everything's fine.  He can't do that to our pledges.  Pledges?  Pledges.  I know where you're going to.  Only we can do that to our pledges.  No, because in the end, we'll fucking...  Leave him alone.  We'll fucking rip someone's eyes out over one of our guys.  I couldn't really believe that he's going to be like, listen, we have to work this  I bet he's going to give him grief.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Based on...  Not anymore, by the way, because we brought it up on the air.  Right.  Now it'll be all...  See what we do for you, E-Rock, in the air? 
[02:08:00]  Thank you.  I think you owe us an apology.  Scott Sharon's a huge fucking radio star.  E-Rock keeps playing those clips.  I couldn't wait to play those today.  Throw me under the bus.  All right.  So we have an old clip from AAF.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Want the intro?  No.  No, we don't need the intro.  Ah, fuck the intro.  Intro.  Jack-tober kind of is whatever.  Yeah.  But you want me to play this first?  Yeah, I wanted to start with something else.  Before we get into you guys, you know, we have a few regulars that we feature on Jack-tober. 
[02:08:30]  Ah, true.  Yes.  And unfortunately, over the last year, we lost one of our favorite shows.  What?  And so we put together, Troy and I, we put together a remembrance piece.  How did we lose them?  Through, I hope, no tragedy.  No, they're still alive.  They're just not broadcasting.  They're not broadcasting anymore at all?  Right.  Gone.  Totally gone.  They're off the air.  What?  Who is it?  Just play the production.  Do you know?  No. 
[02:09:00]  John and Jeff.  John and Jeff.  Oh, no.  We lost John and Jeff.  We are two guys that are unemployed.  We are two guys.  Oh, we're two guys out of work.  We're two guys fighting the obvious.  Yeah.  Wow.  We lost John and Jeff.  The show was canceled.  But CBS thought they were big stars and put them on every single fucking station in overnights.  CBS dropped them when they flipped the talk formats to like now and am.  Oh, man.  They went to a specialty syndicator program. 
[02:09:30]  And then in April of this year, they just kind of stopped.  One of them stopped coming to do the show.  And they don't know why.  Just stopped coming to do the show.  Was it a problem in Thailand, maybe?  Nah.  I don't know.  Yes, yes.  He left Thailand.  One of them.  Wait.  They had one station left?  And then.  No, no.  They were still.  They left CBS.  They were syndicated on another network.  And they were on like AM stations.  And one guy just stopped showing up?  The last couple months, he just stopped coming in and they say personal problems, but nobody knows why. 
[02:10:00]  I can't find any info on it.  And then all of a sudden, the show was just dropped and haven't heard anything since.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  What do we know about that?  Nothing.  I asked everybody in syndication and other radio parts, and nobody has an answer as to why the show just ended.  Ladyboy?  I think maybe worse than that.  Anybody knows anything, please tell us.  But I looked all over.  I asked everybody.  You have no idea.  Nobody knows why the show just suddenly ended.  Other than that, one of them just stopped coming in.  Maybe they hated each other. 
[02:10:30]  We loved hating John and Jeff, too.  Weren't they on like XM or something at night?  They were on K-Rock.  K-Rock, right.  We had to listen to them every morning as we were getting ready for our show.  Yeah, their show was being rebroadcast.  It was horrendous.  And they're terrible.  Yeah, I know.  I used to listen to them.  Horrible.  I know.  Beyond horrible.  They used to help you shit every morning.  Huh?  They used to help you shit every morning.  All right.  They made the shit come out easier.  Yeah, it made me get out of the bathroom faster.  Well, they were at L.A., right?  Because they used to be on the big station in L.A.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It said everything you needed to know about regular radio. 
[02:11:00]  They put them on every fucking station.  Yeah, I remember the big...  And they were horrendous.  When I used to do Corolla's show, I remember the big poster they had of those two guys,  John and Jeff.  Just by looking at them, you know that they were...  The horrible radio show.  Yeah, it was brutal.  Good.  Well, we do the I Remember You.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's hear a tribute.  John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  I will remember you.  Ten years long.  Ten years strong.  Will you remember me? 
[02:11:30]  We're two guys who think anyone who steals a shopping cart should be deported.  We're two guys who think if you lie about a crime, you gotta do the time.  This would be amazing if your audience knew you were joking about this, but this is real  statements.  They think they're going to set the radio world on fire.  We're one guy who thinks child molesting is wrong. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, wow.  You think that's bad, Jim?  Oof.  You gotta do the time.  I'm not a man.  About 65% of married women said this is the most annoying thing about their husband.  I will remember me.  You look at other women, it really bothers wives in particular.  That's me, sir.  I will remember me.  No wonder guys wear sunglasses.  I will remember me. 
[02:12:30]  They did the no wonder guys wear sunglasses thing.  Oh, because they're looking at other women.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They wear sunglasses so you can't get caught.  Oh, boy.  I'm more mad at the person that laughed at that when I was driving to work.  Yeah, I don't think they were.  I don't think they were.  Someone was.  Someone was.  I am happily married, but we're going to look and we're going to say, nice. 
[02:13:00]  I'm happily married.  He had to say that.  I'm happily married.  But what do you say when you see a chick?  Nice.  Nice.  He probably means her shoes.  You think if he wasn't married, he could put up numbers, Sam?  Oh.  You think he would put up numbers?  Yeah, putting up numbers.  Nice.  Nice.  And you know how he picks up girls in the bar?  He looks over their way and he goes like this.  Nice.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  He's got sunglasses on.  They don't know that they're being checked out.  You know what I mean?  You like to try to pick up girls with that guy.  He's your wingman.  What do you think?  If he was your wingman, Florentine, would he get some shit done or what?  Like even if he was single, just the audience that listens to him would never put out.  Right.  Like what some fat soccer mom finds that, you know, oh, that's funny.  Yeah, guys wear sunglasses.  Guys will be guys.  He's like, they're not going to suck your dick in the back of the radio station when you get off the air. 
[02:14:00]  No, no.  What's wrong?  I'm looking at how they're doing this to see if three people are in a car.  That's the West Side Highway, right?  They block all the lanes.  The traffic that they are causing by blocking every lane, it's going to one lane so that the cop can look in the car and see if.  In that vehicle, shuttled across, enter into Manhattan, through the Bronx or up to Connecticut, if you so choose.  So if, in fact, you were traveling there, that was the assumption you were under. 
[02:14:30]  We noticed about an hour ago that there was a checkpoint inadvertently placed on the West Side Highway.  As you exited the George Washington Bridge, where you thought you would be able to go southbound, you were unable to.  We then contacted the NYPD.  We were told that they were going to remove their crew.  We checked our cameras, and they had since been removed.  Now we are taking a look from Chopper 2 HD over the scene.  This is at 125th Street, where a new checkpoint has now been put into place.  So it's some false hope there and some misleading information. 
[02:15:00]  So we're working to get some clarification.  Oh, shut up.  Wow.  I guess there's a problem?  What?  Wow.  So they're causing even more traffic by trying to check the vehicles.  They're fucking traffic up so bad.  You can't take three lanes and make it into one ever and assume that's going to be efficient.  You know how panicky there's so many single people there?  Oh, my God, look how far this goes back, and the cars aren't even moving.  No, dead stop, and it just keeps going.  That's just ridiculous.  But they don't care.  They're just trying to keep it out of Midtown.  Yeah, they don't care about traffic outside of Midtown. 
[02:15:30]  They don't give a fuck about a highway.  Look at how far that fucking goes.  Yeah, but most of those cars are probably following the rules, and they have to be stuck in this mess.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It just keeps going and going, and there's no fucking hope.  Holy shit, and they're doing one car at a time.  And what if you've got three people, and you're paying attention to the rules, and you've got to sit in that fucking lounge?  Dude, those are one lane.  That's hours.  They can't even look and go further, because now it's behind trees and a turn, but hours.  That's a minimum of two or three hours to get past that checkpoint. 
[02:16:00]  You are taking hours to get into the city, even if you're paying attention to the rules.  There's got to be a better way to do it.  Got to be.  At the tolls.  Yeah, but then how do you turn them around?  Just have a lane and go there, over there.  No, they want their money, so they're getting through the tolls before they get to the checkpoint.  Yeah, turn around.  Get the fuck out.  Wow.  All right, back to the John and Jeff.  Oh, yes.  Sad.  If you look for longer than a second, or you do the head-to-toe thing, and you make a comment, 
[02:16:30]  you're being disrespectful.  That's straight-up rude.  You don't do that.  You just don't do that to your wife.  The John and Jeff Show.  The John and Jeff Show.  Ten years long.  Ten years strong.  Guess not.  Wow.  I hope it's over because one of them is dead.  Oh, God.  They made ten years, though.  That's amazing.  How did they make ten years of that crap?  They ended in 2012. 
[02:17:00]  I was looking on Wikipedia.  99 of 2012.  So 13 years.  So don't do the head-to-toe thing because that's disrespectful to your wife.  Disrespectful.  They're right.  Yeah, it is.  You know, you got to give them that.  Those guys have some opinions.  No kidding.  Every opinion they had was just fucking banal and awful.  We think child molesters should go to jail.  Right.  It's a case where they flew under the radar.  You know, that shit no one's going to fucking be bothered by, so.  When you're in Ho Chi Minh City, don't diddle a child in public. 
[02:17:30]  Take him around back.  Because that's what he likes.  Well, we don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I assume.  They decided that they wanted to be the kings of 3 a.m. radio.  Yeah.  And there's no competition.  So.  Couldn't even handle that.  Yeah, but they're probably making a good paycheck to do that.  Yeah.  I guarantee they were making way more money than you are, Sam.  Oh, my God.  Well, who isn't?  And you're better at this shit than they are.  I appreciate that.  But that don't mean shit around here, obviously. 
[02:18:00]  This show was so awful on K-Rock.  We'd come in in the morning.  Oh, it stunk.  Yeah, that was bad.  And they were on that huge station, like I said, out in L.A.  That, what was it, Lycus was on, and Stern was on in the morning, and they had that midday show.  So that was a huge station.  That was like the biggest station in the country.  Right.  Is Lycus still on?  No.  He does like an online show and podcasting.  Wow.  Making money?  I don't know.  I haven't checked.  We've got to help our pal Jay Moore.  I saw him tweeting yesterday, Jay Moore 37. 
[02:18:30]  What's happening with that?  So, you know, the podcast world, which Florentine's part of, you get these sponsors, and then you read their shit for a while, and then they don't pay you.  Because maybe they don't see the return they wanted or thought, so they feel like they don't pay them.  So now Jay Moore's got to chase this guy down for fucking money, and Jay tweeted about it yesterday.  He's pissed.  And I don't blame him.  Yeah, but I think I might be done, because one minute he was pissed, and then the next minute he was talking about how great they were.  What?  I'm glad I didn't say that.  No, I think there was two different companies he was talking about. 
[02:19:00]  Oh.  Where's the...  Did he delete the...  Oh, was it two different companies?  I think so.  Something flex, something, and then another flex.  You sure?  I'm pretty sure.  Is the original tweet still there?  That's why.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Flex Watches is a great company.  Okay.  That's what Florentine was right.  Flex Sports Watches are thieves.  So Flex Sports Watches is the company that has the problem.  Is it the same company?  No.  Well, that's kind of dumb.  Flex Sports Watches is the bad company.  Well, he didn't want anyone to confuse the two companies. 
[02:19:30]  That was it.  But there's Flex Watches and then Flex Sports Watches.  Flex Sports Watches is the bad one.  Yeah, he's pissed.  And they screwed over Eddie Ift and Jim Jeffries podcast.  Yeah.  And a couple other ones, too.  They're not paying them?  Yeah.  That's old school radio.  When I first started, they always hired one person to kind of break your knees and shit  and get your money.  You know, get the money for the company.  That was their whole job, just making calls all day long, going,  when the fuck you're paying for the commercials that we ran? 
[02:20:00]  And now you guys got to deal with that shit.  Yeah.  Because they're not reliable.  I had AdamandEve.com for a couple weeks, but I guess they didn't see any returns.  So they just canceled it.  I got a check for like two weeks.  Yeah.  But they paid you.  Yeah.  They paid me.  But it was supposed to be for like six weeks.  Right.  Two weeks.  But who's buying a fucking dildo and getting it sent to their house?  Nobody.  Nobody's buying fucking porn DVDs.  Yeah.  That's true.  You know, so it's tough, but they know because they put, you know, your link on your podcast  at the end.  So they know where the revenue is coming from. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  So you can't even hide that anymore.  Yeah.  Oh, plenty of people.  No, they're not.  Well, so does Jay need our help?  What does he want from us?  I don't know if he's still on a mission or not right now.  And is he playing the Bregada tomorrow?  He's supposed to do our show tomorrow.  Is it tomorrow or Saturday?  Is it tomorrow?  But I think he wanted to come in tomorrow.  Oh, but it's hard to get tickets.  I don't know.  But can you even get to the Bregada?  I don't even know if it's open.  There's probably no power there, Jay.  Highways up high, though.  You might be able to get right to the Bregada. 
[02:21:00]  But no power.  Oh, yeah.  The casinos might have power.  The casinos might have power, but just the fucking getting there, the fucking, yeah,  the roads.  The people getting there, getting showered, getting into a hotel to gamble.  Yeah.  No one's actually.  The locals are completely in the dark, but the casinos are nice and bright.  Yeah, I know.  Is the Bregada open?  I mean, he's still on the schedule for.  Yeah.  Saturday.  Oh, I'll write him.  We'll find out.  I remember this fucking fat lady when I used to do my newspaper route.  Every time I came to collect, she would always go, could you come back Saturday? 
[02:21:30]  Could you come back Saturday?  Did you?  Yes.  Hated her.  Why Saturday?  She had no money.  Was it a regular paper?  It was like a once a week, like local paper.  It was regular.  I had two streets.  Newton Street.  And, uh, I forget what the other one was.  Cranberry Crossroad?  I don't remember.  Every day?  Yeah, Monday through.  Do kids still knock on fucking strangers' doors to do shit like that?  This is years ago.  I know.  That's what I mean.  Like, is it still like a thing? 
[02:22:00]  Because that's like, it's going to be the most dangerous thing.  Hey, kid.  Go collect money for our fucking newspaper.  I had a paper route.  I wonder if I got diddled.  Collect.  I had one, but I was only like once a week.  It was like a local paper.  Yeah, but maybe I blocked it out.  I had to go to these fucking houses and knock on the door and then collect.  And there's kids just riding around on their bikes with like money in their pockets from collecting.  That was me.  Maybe I got dragged in.  I don't know.  And drugged.  Yeah, and kissed.  And kissed.  You probably didn't even get molested.  You probably just made out with a guy.  Yeah?  Under an Afghan.  You would remember that. 
[02:22:30]  You sure?  Yeah.  All right, good.  Yeah.  We should just dump them down the sewer.  I'm like, I'm a fucking.  And then try to collect.  And they're like, we didn't get the paper.  And my guy was on the driveway.  Not my problem.  It's the wind.  We did that with the penny saver.  The wind.  Then we got a penny saver route because it was more money.  And that's when we started throwing them in the garbage and the dumpsters and all that shit.  Because you had to put all the flyers in.  Yeah, because they weren't paying for the penny saver.  That was free shit.  So I knew like, all right, who's going to check up on the free shit?  Right.  So we dumped a lot of that. 
[02:23:00]  So we get away with it.  But the paper route, that's a tough call.  Wait, now the cops are leaving that checkpoint?  Right, because the news fucking called them out.  So then what?  All those people get to go into Manhattan now, even if they don't have?  I don't know.  Yeah, they don't have a good system in place.  They didn't think this over at all.  But they've done this system before.  They've done this.  Yeah?  Where they've restricted cars coming into Manhattan.  Yes, of course.  For every crossing?  Well, I don't know.  I don't know either.  Man, people are going to start fucking killing each other. 
[02:23:30]  Tomorrow's the day.  There'll be deaths over this shit.  If you're coming from Jersey, you can go over to GW and come down the West Side Highway  and still get in a single car.  But now they're letting people pass here.  But they were not letting them.  They were making you go back north or whatever.  Yeah, that's the GWB.  That's the West Side Highway after the GWB.  Holy mother of God.  This is weird.  I've been trying to stall, but it's not working.  So we've got to play this.  Yeah, let's get back to this.  We've got to play this Curse Man thing.  What year is this from?  Anyone know?  All right, it's from AAF. 
[02:24:00]  So that was like...  I'd say it's even early.  95 to 98.  It's not going to save you.  Somewhere around there.  No, it's not going to save you.  Yeah.  It's definitely AAF because somebody, during one statement, has a Boston accent.  Okay.  Come on, guys.  Let's let the last flow.  This is probably a good bit.  What's going on, brother man?  Hey, wow.  What's going on, brother man?  I guess the whole thing, it's called Curse Man.  I don't remember doing this, really. 
[02:24:30]  So we're cursing and just bleeping out the curses?  Because that would be pretty edgy radio.  I'd call up as a guy that had stories.  It was you?  Yeah.  It was me.  Sorry.  Did you put an effect on it?  So it was almost...  That it was actually a caller?  So it didn't sound like it was coming from the studio?  How do you guys play it?  He was doing sort of a Pesci.  Yeah.  A little Pesci.  Yeah.  It wasn't really a Pesci.  Doing his own voice, but sort of based on a Pesci movie.  I just wanted to sound like an obnoxious guy, you know?  And then I'd call on the phone, but in the background, we'd have traffic noises like it was somewhere else. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, so you'd put the noises.  Oh, yeah.  Would we put the noises?  And who came up with the name Curse Man?  I have no idea.  You didn't think that maybe you could put a little more thought into it than Curse Man?  Dude, it was 95, 96.  That's all you need to do.  What, like, AJ poopy shits, you fucking hack?  Well, at least there's some mystery.  Like, oh, what's he all about?  It's not a mystery.  It stinks.  What's going on, brother man?  Hey, well, tomorrow the day of our country continues. 
[02:25:30]  Madonna's got a rug rat.  I read the kid already has a lawyer and wants to put herself...  Well, who are we talking about?  You said Madonna has a rug rat.  Oh, Madonna.  Madonna's got a rug rat.  You should know.  You were laughing.  Madonna's got a rug rat.  Where the hell did it sound like you were calling from with all that shit in the background?  I was big into production to make it really sound authentic.  So you were supposedly on a cell phone, not in a house.  Yeah.  I assume we taped this beforehand, right? 
[02:26:00]  Of course.  This entire thing, the exchange and everything, was taped beforehand.  We'd do the phone call and then we'd get some sound effects.  And then we'd play it and just sit back.  And then occasionally, I guess, you'd turn the mic on so I would go, ha, yeah, yeah, like I was there.  This guy was calling from his car.  Yeah, it was a car phone.  Right, right.  I was calling from my car.  One of the commuters out there.  One of the mini commuters.  Right.  And you left all the windows down with all the traffic and everything else to make a call.  Why wouldn't I?  I wanted to make sure people understood he was calling from traffic.  I got it.  I understand, everyone.  I'm calling from now.  But Donna had a rug rat. 
[02:26:30]  That's what you do when you call a radio station.  By the way, that rug rat is now 16, 17 years old.  That's pretty fucking hot.  Yeah.  But Donna's daughter's got nice.  Oh, I'm a cop.  Shootings have started.  You want to go to this real fast?  What?  All right.  Really fast.  Scott in Jersey.  Scott.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, Norton.  It's not going to start tomorrow.  It already started yesterday.  What did?  Well, no.  In general, we said the average person could be patient for three days and then all hell would break loose.  So we're basically saying Friday, you're going to see a lot of shit going down. 
[02:27:00]  Well, what happened?  Yeah.  Well, already down here in New Jersey, we've already had burglaries gone bad.  You know, people looting in houses and, you know, people basically shooting at each other.  Well, those are bad people.  The good people start losing it after a little while.  After three days.  We understand, though.  Yeah, but there's definitely more shootings within the past day than there have been over  the past couple of months.  And there'll be more tomorrow.  Where's the looting going on?  All the areas that, you know, have been hit the hardest down here on the Jersey Shore. 
[02:27:30]  I like the vagueness.  I'm in the Ocean County.  I like the vagueness of the whole thing.  Most of it's not in the newspaper because, you know, they're not able to access those  areas.  What areas are these shootings going on in Jersey?  Where?  Monmouth and Ocean County.  Okay.  What part of those counties?  What's that?  What part of those counties?  All along the shore. 
[02:28:00]  The areas that were the hardest hit.  This guy stinks.  He's awful.  You're a terrible caller, sir.  Very, very bad.  Yeah.  Are you trying to say the blacks are misbehaving?  What's that?  Are you trying to say the blacks are misbehaving?  No, actually, it's not them, actually.  All right.  See, this is the best call.  I'll say this is a better call than you got at AAF.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  All right.  If you're going to call up with that shit, you kind of have to have details. 
[02:28:30]  We can't pull everything out of you.  No, he's just...  I know.  I don't want to do that.  He was worthless.  Every answer had to have a follow-up question.  He just wanted you to talk to him.  All right.  We'll go to this then.  What's going on, brother man?  Hey, well, the moral decay of our country continues.  Madonna's got a rug read.  I read the kid already has a lawyer and wants to put herself up for adoption.  All right.  I don't like this...  All right, man.  You can hear from the laughs that this shit is good.  So the kid already has a lawyer and wants to put herself up for adoption. 
[02:29:00]  I've never heard...  That was the joke.  That was the big joke.  I've heard the tonality of Opie's laughs when he thinks something is funny before.  I've never heard that tonality in one of Opie's laughs.  What?  If something's funny, I'm going to laugh soon.  Ha ha!  Oh.  Obviously, the material is fucking spot on.  I'm laughing.  Okay.  Oh, this is terrible.  I'm not sure it's legit.  It's the only thing.  Oh, it's legit.  Okay.  Okay.  What do you mean? 
[02:29:30]  You were there?  Nah, I would have liked to seen it.  Whoa.  How do you...  Wow.  What?  Did you hear your voice?  Who?  What?  Just now, when you said that.  Did you hear that?  That was me.  When you said you were there?  That was good.  I said, were you there?  Yeah, that's it.  Why were you there?  I was talking to the guy on the phone.  Why were you there?  I know.  I had to fit it in.  Well, where's the curse?  You don't think it sounds natural?  Where's the curse, man?  I don't hear curses.  I think that's what everyone should be asking you, too.  Why were you there? 
[02:30:00]  Just wait for it.  Oh, it's coming.  He should have thrown one earlier.  Are you trying to say it doesn't sound natural when Ant's trying to talk to himself?  Son of a bitch.  Not at all.  Why are you there?  The thing about Curse Man is, the longer you keep him on, the more outrageous he gets.  Oh, okay.  It's one of those deals.  And is there a problem with that?  No, that's what you want from a caller.  See, he really should have cursed right off the bat.  You go, hey, hey, hey, easy.  We're on a radio.  Okay, sorry.  Throwing out within the first 15 seconds of the call. 
[02:30:30]  Establish why they call you the Curse Man.  Exactly.  Why wouldn't I?  It's effing crazy out there.  Whoa, easy, easy.  We should have established what he's all about.  Right.  It's like you could say, I know you're the Curse Man and everything, but we've got a job to do as well.  Something like that.  Hey, hey, I'm sorry there.  I'm sorry.  Right.  You do a good Curse Man.  I know.  It's one of my impressions.  I feel like I'm sitting next to a celebrity.  Ah, that's crazy, right?  First option.  But I don't like to see what was going on in that delivery room, eh? 
[02:31:00]  What do you mean?  You were there?  No, I would have liked to have seen it.  A private part, see more action in the beaches of Normandy on DJ.  Coming out of there, it must have been like riding a wacky water slide at Agawan Park.  Oh, a local.  Wow, you went local, too.  You went local, then?  Nice.  I mean, Curse Man?  Does Curse Man know to keep it local?  He kept it local.  You've got to keep it local.  Local is important.  You're cracking the host up.  But you know what?  I mean, you did make a big vagina joke, so.  Yeah, yeah, I did.  And you probably kept it.  I'll give you a little credit for that.  Absolutely.  It was a big, you know. 
[02:31:30]  This is terrible.  We could go back to abusing us, but what is this line for?  Bus.  What?  No way, that's a bus line.  Buses that will get used at 57th in Lexington.  Look at the line.  What is that for?  No, it's not.  She said yesterday it took her four hours to get to work.  I said, how long does it usually take to get to work?  She said an hour and a half.  I said, what is your hope today of how long it's going to take you to get there?  She said, I'm hoping for about two hours.  When we got here to the Barclays Center, she said, I think I'm rethinking things here. 
[02:32:00]  It's going to take a lot longer.  And she said, I think what a lot of people here are saying, is it really worth going to work today  if it takes you four or five hours to get to work like it did yesterday?  But this is a big, big mess here at the Barclays Center.  The lines are incredibly long.  And I know the NHL Loda told us yesterday that we need to be patient.  But I don't think anyone expected the long, long lines like we're seeing here.  But that is the situation here at the Barclays Center.  I would say there are thousands and thousands of people just snaking back and forth in a long, long line here 
[02:32:30]  from the exit of the subway lines underneath the Barclays Center to try to get onto the buses.  But it is a big, big mess here.  And that young lady is the only person that you spoke with.  I mean, what kind of bosses do these people have?  What kind of bosses?  Perhaps if you listen to yesterday's show, you'll figure out what kind of bosses.  I think people just want to get out of the house.  You think that's it?  They've been cooked up for three or four days.  They want to go to work.  I think they're scared if they don't at least try that they would get fired over this shit. 
[02:33:00]  What boss doesn't understand that crap?  I think that part of them is they want to go in and get paid.  Wow.  Wow, that's like, they're not getting to work today.  This is crazy.  Work starts right now, and these people are on a three, four hour line.  They're all zigzagged through like in a fucking popular Disney ride.  Holy fuck.  Jeez.  I'm telling you, man, all it takes, one week of this shit.  Yeah, they got to get this shit cranking and working or else. 
[02:33:30]  And life as we know it would be completely over.  Oh, boy.  Yes, popular Disney ride.  Oh, right.  Back to Curse Man.  Brother Man.  Brother Man, Brother Man.  That's right.  Let's get some more laughs going.  You won't be laughing when I get a Brother Man, Brother Man t-shirt out there.  Still no Curse.  No Curse.  From the Curse Man.  From the audience, perhaps.  Or on the audience.  Well, look.  Look, guys.  From 1990, I'm going to call six. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, this is rolling out.  Curse Man keeps going.  Opie can't believe how nuts he is.  Yeah.  I mean, I think on one part of your mind, you're thinking, oh, my God.  Like, Curse Man is crazy, but I've got a career to worry about here.  I know how to sell shit.  But I know how to sell shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate the Sam synopsis, by the way.  You do?  Why?  You like it when it's other people.  Oh, and Opie says, this is crazy.  Yeah.  I ain't saying she's Fred Scott down there, but rumor has it the kid drove out in a Buick. 
[02:34:30]  Now I hear the poor kid has a slight defect, you know.  A defect?  There's your dent in the head where Dennis Rodman's **** was hitting you.  Oh, you can't say that?  I just didn't.  I don't mind the jokes.  Oh, great.  I don't mind.  Thank you.  Because everyone did big Madonna, big vagina jokes.  Of course.  No, but that's okay, though.  At that time, you know.  It really was.  Sure.  Sure.  And then Madonna, you know, Dennis Rodman's dick.  I don't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there was a curse. 
[02:35:00]  It's just the voices kind of.  Stinks.  You can't say that.  That's terrible.  But you can't say that on the radio.  You can't say that.  You're right.  You still can't, but that's not bad, though.  You don't like the voice I was putting on there?  Come on.  I want to hear the last part of that.  Because, whoa, Curse Man went too far, even though his name's Curse Man.  Yeah.  I'm surprised you took his call to tell you the truth.  I know.  Because we're aware that he's going to curse eventually.  And then when he does, we're very surprised that he just cursed.  That's amazing.  Even though his name's called Curse Man.  It's amazing that you hit the dump button.  I'm confused.  Yes.  To bleep it.  And it landed right on Dick. 
[02:35:30]  Perfect.  Nothing else got cut.  Just that.  Perfect.  Well, I'm a professional broadcaster, Mr. Florentine.  Saved our job.  Now I hear the poor kid has a slight defect, you know.  A defect?  There's a dent in the head where Dennis Rodman's **** was hitting you.  You can't say that?  I just did.  Well, I just did.  I just did.  You're no prisoners, Curse Man.  It's sort of a mad dog and jerky boys like Frank Rizzo, Joe Pesci, me.  Was there anyone doing prank phone calls in, like, 96 that didn't have a little Frank Rizzo? 
[02:36:00]  Everyone.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  Like Rizzo.  Open your **** ears, jackass.  But, you know, Curse Man then curses and I'm there to say you can't do that.  That's crazy.  Thank God.  And then he's like, well, yeah, I just did.  What are you going to do about it?  And you were like, we were all having a good time, but maybe I've let this go a bit too far.  That's right.  Curse Man is out of control.  Sam's right, though.  Sam's right.  He's very rebellious, too.  He says, you can't say that.  I just did.  I just did.  What are you going to do about it? 
[02:36:30]  Sam knows my dilemma.  I mean, let's ignore the fact that his name was Curse Man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got to be surprised when he actually curses.  Somewhere Opie is questioning himself, saying, did I encourage this negative behavior?  Oh, God.  Like, is this my fault?  I got to stop it.  I want a time machine.  Yeah?  I want to grab that guy by his long hair because he thought he would look younger if he grew  his hair out.  I would pull him down the stairs head first by his hair.  Yeah, yeah.  Wouldn't you be afraid of hurting him?  Oh, I wouldn't give a fuck. 
[02:37:00]  No.  I would go, go do something else with your life, you loser.  Opie laughs at the Curse Man with a legit laugh.  That's right.  Are you trying to say this wasn't legit?  I bet that's sarcastic.  No, I'm trying to say, like, ew, just out and out guffawed in his humor.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy, you should leave for your flight now.  It's tomorrow.  I know.  You should leave now.  I want to hear some laughs.  You see this shit, though?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, but you know from all that sex and dancing she does, she got some strong womb muscles. 
[02:37:30]  Strong womb muscles?  Yeah, when that kid shot out, it was good for a first down.  Hey, I'm glad it was a girl, though.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, now she can put pretty pink bows in her hair.  One on the reach armpit.  Ah!  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  Arm pit hair.  Because she was hairy.  Yeah, Madonna had like an armpit hair.  That was her hairy armpit fucking stage.  No, I know.  What's wrong with that, Sam?  Nothing.  Oh, boy.  I like that Anthony finally got in.  I didn't like that Opie was monopolizing the time with the Curse Man. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  I like that Anthony finally got in.  How natural is it?  We want the world to know.  Strong womb muscles?  Yeah, I wasn't crazy about that one.  Oh, boy.  Shot out at a first down.  I know.  But the hair, I, you know.  Well, let me tell you something.  We didn't want the listeners to be suspicious that it was Anthony, so you got to have Anthony  talking to the Curse Man.  What's wrong with that, Sam?  Now it's foolproof.  That's so bad.  There hasn't been one bad edit this whole time, so there's no way they could.  Because if people started calling, go, oh, that's obviously Anthony.  I'm like, how is it obviously Anthony?  If Anthony was talking to him, we all know it was a live phone call. 
[02:38:30]  She said, I wanted to go on vacation someplace I'd never been, so I took her to the kitchen.  This is my best stuff, folks.  We wound up being number one, huh?  Yep.  We turned it around.  But you sound like number two.  Look at this line.  Look at this fucking line.  Oh, my God.  That's before they get into the single line.  No, what that is for is they're actually fucking, they're buying tickets for my Buffalo New  Year's Eve show. 
[02:39:00]  Nice.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow.  You should do very well there.  You see how everyone's walking forward nicely.  They have to walk all the way down there to turn around and walk all the way back from  where they came from.  Well, you know why they're walking nicely?  Look.  Look at the crowd of people.  They're going to work.  They're of a certain, let's say, let's say they fit well in society.  In social circumstances, a lot of people online being patient.  I don't see any punching, wilding, rioting, much like you do when maybe they have this 
[02:39:30]  Black Friday thing when the stores open up and these people crowd in and punch and kill  each other.  I'm seeing it because they're going to someplace called work.  But why, instead of waiting on a line that snakes forever for hours, why wouldn't you  just walk?  Walk over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Why wouldn't you at that point?  It's a long walk, of course.  How far is the Barclays Center from the bridge?  It's obviously pretty close, right?  They just showed it from the helicopter and it didn't look like...  There are people walking.  It looked doable.  There are people going over the bridge right there.  I'm sure people wouldn't be happy to do it, but it looks doable more than waiting on 
[02:40:00]  a bus line.  That's crazy.  It's maybe five blocks.  It's only five blocks from the bridge?  It's crazy.  From the Barclays Center on Atlantic Avenue up to the bridge is about five blocks.  Are you sure?  It's pretty close.  But they may have to go to Midtown.  A lot of people just want to get on the bus and go to Midtown.  There it is.  Yeah, but they're waiting hours when...  That is a long walk, man.  Come on.  That's a long fucking walk.  Yeah, but you see the line they're on?  It's crazy.  The line's got to be well over a mile long to begin with.  Crazy.  So why don't you just say, fuck it, I'll just walk this out?  Jesus. 
[02:40:30]  I heard Pepper Hicks walked in from Astoria yesterday.  Is that true?  Yeah.  As they said, he walked in from Queens.  That's insane.  The show Ron does...  What do you mean the show Ron does?  I just stopped myself.  What were you going to say?  I forgot, and I wasn't going to take a cheap shot.  I tell you, these guys, they walk so far, they've got to be so effing tired.  Whoa!  Chris, Jimmy.  Just to finish my statement, I was going to say that Ron's co-host walked in from Astoria.  Oh, no. 
[02:41:00]  It's not the Ron and Pepper show.  I know, but I stopped myself.  And then you said, what do I mean?  Oh, so that was just to fill curiosity, not your statement.  No.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  How many miles did he walk to do the show with Ron yesterday?  That's pretty bad.  I don't know, a lot.  Wow, is that bad?  A lot.  Oh, God.  Whoa.  Fuck.  Do you get scared when people are on lines?  Oh, boy.  What's that?  That was Florentine.  That's you.  Yeah.  No.  Please.  That's a Florentine fart.  I could pick that out of a fucking room full of a thousand farts. 
[02:41:30]  Like a fine wine.  Yeah.  Like a bouquet?  There was a little, but you got up and moved around, so I'm kidding.  I might have knocked it around.  You might have added to the mix.  Did you add to it?  No, I would love to.  Is it a combo?  No, no.  It's just Jim.  Believe me, you'll know when I cut.  I could have guessed it before, but.  All right.  Well, I guess we get to the end of the Curse Man bit, Sam.  Oh.  Now you hear the proud mother pass up cigars after the birth?  Really?  Yeah, she even smokes one.  Sure.  Any excuse to put something long and brown in her mouth.  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  Hey, and if you want to look at the kid in the hospital nursery behind that glass?  Right.  It'll cost you ten bucks and a two-drink minimum.  All right, Curse Man!  He only said dick.  That was it.  There was no other curses.  Yeah, he just had the one.  Curse Man!  Benchmark bit complete.  Oh, no.  Could we?  All right.  The voices were horrendous.  But the jokes weren't so bad.  At that time, those Madonna jokes.  Big black cock joke in her mouth. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, it was fine.  I don't get the ten dollars, two-drink minimum.  Behind the glass, like Madonna was doing.  At that time, she had that video a little.  Oh, right.  Not at that time, but she did have that video where she was behind the glass, and you had  to put the money in, and it slid up.  I've been in a lot of peep boots.  There's no two-drink minimum.  I know.  Not at all.  Maybe two loads.  Two-load minimum.  Yeah, there was no two-drink.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I miss peep boots, man.  I know.  I miss them.  I should have worded that differently.  No more peep boots?  They're around, but with the internet, you don't need them.  Oh.  And, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  I want to hear the end of it, though, because I think I coughed over it.  I didn't hear the very end.  I think it was terrific, man.  Can I see it, like, the last few seconds?  This was our benchmark bid, and we fucking were very successful with it.  And it's strong.  It was nice.  The bridge is way further away than five blocks from the bus line.  Yeah, I figured Iraq was wrong about that.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know where you got five blocks from.  I mean, but it looks like it's within range to walk.  It's pretty far.  All right.  All right.  Nursery behind that glass.  Right.  It'll cost you ten bucks and a two-drink minimum.  I'm out of here, though. 
[02:43:30]  All right, curse man!  Afternoon drive.  Excitement.  What did you say?  I'm out of here what?  I don't know.  I'm out of here.  Ope?  Did I say ope?  You said asshole.  Oh, did I?  Wow, we let asshole go through.  No.  No.  I'll play that again.  I think you were allowed to say asshole back then.  You might have been outraged if you had said that ope.  Back then, you were allowed to say asshole.  I'm almost positive.  I think so, too.  Now you hear the brown mother.  How do I do this?  Hold on a second.  Nursery behind that glass.  Right.  It'll cost you ten bucks and a two-drink minimum. 
[02:44:00]  I'm out of here, co-op.  All right, curse man!  Now, I said ope or something.  Yeah.  I said I'm out of here, asshole.  Yeah, I don't hear ope.  Really?  I'm outie.  I think you used to say outie.  Outie.  That was one of your things.  You should have been outie in the studio.  I was brought in and you were outie.  Fucking in an air conditioning truck.  What, man?  It was our benchmark bit.  I'm telling you right now.  That was the curse man. 
[02:44:30]  We probably teased that all day, saying, I think today's the day.  Curse man's calling again.  I think it's happening today.  You should have sprinkled in a few more curses.  Yeah.  The jokes were fine.  And got rid of the voice.  Yeah.  And just did it.  Just as a Boston guy, you should have just done.  How come curse man didn't make the CD?  What happened?  They were afraid it would dominate the entire CD and that's all you'd want to listen to.  Did the rest of the guys at the station get jealous that the curse man would only call  in your show?  Hey, look, man.  Those guys had way worse bits. 
[02:45:00]  Come on.  That was fucking great.  I'm not even going to fucking play.  Those guys stunk.  And then we'd, like, later on in the show, we'd take a call where someone's like, hey,  could you play curse man again?  I was really fucking cool.  It's like, yeah, I think we can do that.  Curse man called a little earlier.  Here's what it sounded like.  And that was our friends.  Hey, man, could you call me and just say how bright that curse man was?  Could you please just call us and request it?  Could you replay it?  Yeah, no problem.  You faked requests.  Did you guys do a thing where, you know, the 25th caller gets a T-shirt and there was  not 25 calls, so you would just plunk it down. 
[02:45:30]  Fuck it.  25th.  25th.  And it was only, like, two lines lit.  Who we got here?  Hey, we got someone on the line, eh?  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, his name is, uh, curse.  Someone named Curse Chip.  Oh, I was here.  Oh, wow, okay.  Curse Chip.  Cock, fuck, a piece of shit.  Fuck.  Duty dog shit.  Whoa.  Hey.  That's too far. 
[02:46:00]  You're going crazy.  Motherfucker, cock, sucker.  Hey.  Brother man, take it easy.  Yo, brother man, take it down a notch.  You motherfucker, spook, tipper, uh, teacher, garbage, bullshit, fuck your fat pig.  Curse Chip.  Hey.  Oh, hey.  What are you doing?  I had a kid out of a cunt or something.  Curse Chip.  Stop it.  It's going to get us fired.  Yeah, that's too much.  Curse Chip.  It's wild.  Yeah.  How about, uh, uh, fuck, shit. 
[02:46:30]  So what are you doing, Curse Chip?  I'm just fucking cursing.  That's what I do.  I don't give a fuck.  Oh, man.  Wow.  I don't know how to end this.  This is too crazy.  You just go, brother man, brother man.  Yeah.  Why are you so angry?  Yeah.  Fucking balls full of cum juice all over your mother's ankles.  Wow.  That's, that's outrageous.  You're crazy, Curse Chip. 
[02:47:00]  You're crazy, Curse Chip.  Well, whose mother are you talking about?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Woo!  Curse Chip.  Curse Chip.  What are you doing?  I'm fucking a fuck.  Fucking tit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Pussy.  All right.  All right.  Curse Chip.  Yeah.  Fucking pizza shit.  Just hang up, Curse Chip. 
[02:47:30]  What's that?  Hang up.  I'm fucking Carson, top soccer.  Hang up, Curse Chip.  Curse Chip beats the shit out of Curse, man.  We've got to play Hey, Masturbator, so we've got to go.  Oh, Jesus.  I've got to close with a good one.  Yeah.  Okay.  Fuck.  That's a good one.  There he goes, Cursed Chip.  Cursed Chip.  Look, man, you want to bring your fucking tapes in, Florentine?  I put a whole album out of my awful shit.  How's that doing?  It's doing great. 
[02:48:00]  It's infuriating people, though.  It is.  Yeah, I know.  People are like, dude, I bought it, but I didn't think it was going to be that bad.  And he just goes, I warned you.  I warned you.  I fucking told you.  Put it right on the cover.  I told you.  It's going to be awful.  Over 220 awful jokes in this CD.  I told you.  Up front.  ONA Jingle Contest is brought to you by Steven Singer Jewelers.  Good IHateStevenSinger.com today.  Can we get some more jingles?  Yeah.  Maybe tomorrow?  Yeah, definitely.  Jingles.  Now that October is officially over, kind of puttered out, but still, it was a success. 
[02:48:30]  Still lingering?  Yeah.  We'll move into the jingle contest.  The ONA Jingle Contest.  We'll have brand new entries tomorrow.  Yeah.  All right.  ONA used to say a major disaster could never happen in New York.  Chad in North Carolina.  Chad!  Chad!  Did we?  Is this a major disaster?  This is kind of disastrous.  It's way up there.  Yeah.  Wow.  Where is that?  That's a helix.  I don't know. 
[02:49:00]  I'm trying to figure it out.  Is that the helix?  People are not going to work today.  The fuck?  Where are they going in just to turn around?  Because they're going to have the same commute out of here.  Yeah.  That's fucking nutty.  The BQE gets stuck at the checkpoint for the Brooklyn Bridge.  So if you can hit the local streets and go to the Manhattan Bridge, that's where you'll  find the least impact, but it's not going to be great.  You won't get there quickly, but it will be better than traveling along the BQE.  I would just quit. 
[02:49:30]  What happened?  What happened?  This didn't work out well.  What happened?  Oh, did he just blast another one?  Oh, God.  Who's blasting?  Oh, it's Florentine.  Is it really Florentine?  I just got to stretch.  They're so bad.  They are so bad.  What did you eat, Florentine?  What did you have last night?  That burger's off the grill.  Nice.  Oh, nice.  What were you drinking?  Nothing.  Something warm?  Some cider.  Some cider.  It really is bad.  Wow.  Dickens cider.  No, so you got a preemptive strike over there. 
[02:50:00]  You didn't get any of it.  No, I got some.  No.  I did.  It's coming through the shirt.  I'm glad I found out.  It can't be over there that quick.  I'm glad I found out.  No, he waved it over.  Get away from me, Edgar.  God, fucking Edgar and his dumb nails.  Bobby calls him baby nails.  I got it tinkled very desperately.  All right, we got RZA coming in today, right?  Yeah, we're going to talk chess.  We're going to talk chess with RZA and some other things, and Florentine's playing Texas.  Texas.  Texas, I'm sorry.  Fort Worth, Texas. 
[02:50:30]  HyenasComedyNightClub.com, but Jim Florentine's going to be there in Fort Worth this weekend.  When do you fly out?  Tomorrow.  Oh, good luck to you as well.  I should be all right at Newark.  Yeah, I should be all right at Newark.  All right, good.  And then I don't know if Uncle Vinny's is still standing.  That's in the heart of this mess, Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  That's next weekend.  Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on.  Have they called you?  No, I haven't heard anything.  Does anyone know?  By next week, it'll be fine.  We have people that know this shit.  Well, like Jenkinson's on the beach and the whole boardwalk supposedly got wiped out. 
[02:51:00]  Jenkins is gone?  Well, the whole boardwalk, the whole Point Pleasant boardwalk is gone, and Jenkinson's  was in front of the boardwalk.  Oh, boy.  Like right on that side there, so.  And what about the Jersey Shore house?  That made it.  The house?  The house itself.  The house itself is still standing.  The t-shirt store got a lot of damage.  Seaside got hit bad.  Seaside got fucking nailed.  Belmar got it bad, too.  They showed a, somebody sent me a picture of a place we did, it got DJs.  Yeah, that got nailed?  It got, nothing but sand, holy fuck. 
[02:51:30]  DJs, yeah.  But it looks like the building was still standing.  Yeah, that's right across the.  Remember that place?  Yeah.  That's right on the beach across the road.  Yeah, but it's all sand now, just piled up in front of it.  Lots and lots of sand.  More sand than I could imagine.  I didn't think the sand would be that much.  Craziness.  Yeah.  Whoa, that guy's flying.  Yeah, they're trying to fucking keep these cars in line.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Florentine is a gassy motherfucker.  I'm going to take a piss.  All right.  I don't have to sit through this.  Oh, you can't say that! 
[02:52:00]  Sitting in my house and I know that I'm alone  Feeling kind of horny, got a tingle in my bone  Going grab a pet as it's the one with Sharon Stone  Hey, Master Vader  Going a little faster and it's feeling kind of nice  Once ain't enough, so I have to do it twice  If you want to smack the monkey, I can give you good advice  Hey, Master Vader  I have all the fire and all the money to me

Every time a black guy walks in, I start talking like a little more urban  I don't know why that is  You throw the groove in you, kid  Yeah, yeah  It happens every time  We do have a few people, though, like, fucking morning mashup  What's her name?  Nicole  Nicole  Who was in here?  Vivica A. Fox  Vivica A. Fox came in  You would think Nicole was fucking born in Harlem and just fucking  She wouldn't stop talking like  It's ghetto  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Getting all fucking ghetto on her ass 
[02:54:30]  Do black people do that to white?  Because white people do that  And I notice it as a white guy  Like, I know how a guy talks  And then I see, like, another black guy come over  And he sounds different  Do black guys do that around white people?  And you notice it?  Yeah  In the business world, you know what I mean?  I know some people that, like, they, um  Like, you know, they'll be doing business  They'll call you  Hey, what up?  I want you to come on by and check out my thing  Then you meet him  It's like, this is a big, tall, black dude  Yeah, yeah  So, you know, it's good  So it works both ways  There was a pretty funny fucking clip of one of the news guys 
[02:55:00]  That was doing a stand-up report from some place out in the suburbs  And big black guy, and he's just kind of going  And we'll be here for the duration to make sure  And then he's like, what motherfucker?  He's like, goddamn, get me out of this country-ass motherfucker  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Bugs are flying in his face  It's hilarious  Like, he was trying to be all  And then he just lost his fucking mind  I'd rather watch the guy who's annoyed that there's bugs on  I would watch that guy every night  Yes, yes 
[02:55:30]  A guy being himself and just, you know  But they try to shed all that  All reporters try to shed all accents  Because they never want you to know what part of the country they're from  Yeah, yeah  Because they're always moving from Florida to L.A. to Boston  Just a milk-toasty fucking kind of  It's a business move  It really is, absolutely  Where you from, Rizzo?  Me, I'm from Brooklyn, New York  So, are you dealing with this storm?  Oh, yeah, well, I've been in L.A. lately  But I've been up here for the whole week  And the storm has been  It tore down some of my property  And Josie  My sister  Her roof got blown off

[02:57:00]  I did not even know that you were the guy  Responsible for this directorial debut, huh?  Yeah, y'all  And you get a couple of pretty major league stars to direct  Yeah  How the hell did that happen?  Yeah, I had to focus in on my talent  Zone in, build it up  And people recognized that I had the ability  And they trusted me with their own selves  You know, Russell Crowe, Lucy Liu  Queen Tarantino  And here I am, yo  You know, it took a lot of studying  It wasn't like an overnight time 
[02:57:30]  Really?  Yeah  You were an American gangster, too  Who were you an American gangster?  Because I love that film  I haven't seen it in a while  I was Detective Moses Jones  Okay  Don't let me have to put the cuffs on you, kid  It's like acting is hard enough  I've done some  It's hard  And directing  Seems like it would be easier  But it's not  No, directing is like Captain Kirk  Flying an Enterprise  You know what I mean?  You are in control of all these people 
[02:58:00]  And every decision has to be made  And for me, what made it a little difficult  Was I also had acting scenes in the movie  So I have to be like, action  And kind of zone into the character  I don't do it for nobody  But you  I'm not cutting  I got to do that shit again  And cut  That is weird like to have  Because you can't just be in character  Yeah  Yeah, so that was a little skit  So  By the way, did I show how out of show business  I really am?  Acting is hard  Directing is hard  And then I threw it to him  I really added nothing 
[02:58:30]  Fucking non-show business  You know what I am?  You're working on it  Hey, I want to share something with you guys  And shit  Because I know your show is crazy  You've been on for many years  Doing great things  I'm working on my comedy  Yeah  And I want to try one on you guys  Okay  It might not go well  It might not go well  Well, after those Madonna jokes we heard before  Probably going to be good  We'll see if it's his curse, man  Well, you hear about the things that's going on  You know, I'm from Brooklyn, New York, Brownsville  So we had, I think, like 90 murders this year 
[02:59:00]  Chicago, 400 murders  And you got some of these kids out there  And they, you know, they're doing violence with each other  I'm against the violence  I wish they would pit down their guns  And find a better way to express themselves  Hilarious so far  Yeah  Exactly  See, I'm working on it, kid  But the one dude  This 18-year-old kid  He gets locked up and shit  And he's in jail  He's crying  He killed somebody  But now he's in jail  He's crying  And the guy comes over to him  And says, hey, hey, hey  No crying in jail  You know, jail's not that bad 
[02:59:30]  You like movies?  He's like, yeah, yeah, I like movies  Hey, we got movies on Mondays in jail  You know, you can watch movies  And kid like this  You like basketball, kid?  Yeah, yeah, I like basketball  He's like, well, we have  Saturdays we play basketball in jail, kid  You know, you like Italian food?  Yeah, yeah, I like Italian food  He's like, hey  Wednesdays, Chef Boyardee  We have spaghetti in jail  Are you homosexual?  No, no, no, I'm not homosexual  Well, kid, you're going to hate Thursdays  So the movie opens 
[03:00:00]  Well, kid, you're going to hate Thursdays  I'm working on it  I said I'm working on it  I'm working on it, kid  So the movie  It just needs to be cut down a little  Wait, what were the first two?  Yes  Edit that  Here's how you fix that  You make  You don't  You don't set it up sad  Like  But that's the trick, kid  No, because  That wasn't it?  No, because if you just say  There's a kid in jail  He's 18  You get to it faster  And what was the first day?  Movie  Monday  Tuesday 
[03:00:30]  Okay  Monday, Tuesday  I think the setup was a little long  Yeah  And a little too depressing  You're going to love Monday  You're going to love Tuesday  And the homosexual, no  Well, then you're going to hate Wednesday through Sunday  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Yeah, like he's going to get his ass fucked every day  More gay sex  Okay  Two days of the week are good  More prison rape  So I'm working on my reverse psychology  I set it up  You thought it was a true story  That's true  Okay, see  He was trying for the  It's like  You always find  You know  How does the  Do not walk on the grass sign 
[03:01:00]  Get on the grass  Who puts it right  Yeah, these are the kind of questions I ask myself  They say  Nobody's perfect  But we should practice to be perfect  Why should we practice?  Practice  What does God say when an angel sneeze?  These are the type of questions I ask myself  I thought Mitch Hedbrook died  Anyway, I'm working on it, guys  I'm working on it  I'm losing my audience on the right now  Maybe with a kid that going to jail 
[03:01:30]  Say he's a big Penn State fan  Maybe throwing a Penn State reference  Or Sandusky  Kind of thing  Yeah, something there too  Okay  Yeah, because that shit's hilarious  I'm working on it  Yeah  It's all good  We talked about before  I mentioned before  Because I see the year you play chess  Oh yeah  When people are locked up  I've never been locked up  Except for one night  But they play a lot of chess  And a lot of guys in jail  Are fucking great chess players  Yeah, they're all great chess players  I had a buddy who couldn't play  To beat him all the time  Goes in 
[03:02:00]  Don't see him for three years  Come out  Start whipping on me  Wow  I had to go in  Just to work on my game  To come back out  Now I'm great  So do you play well?  You got me now  You play good?  I'm pretty cool with chess  I love it  But I'm fucking  I'll never be better  Like I've hit my limit  I've been playing since I was a kid  Is that possible?  You just hit a limit  And you can't learn anything more?  They see that  I still fall for shit  Like how did I  How does that happen?  I know where my queen and my rook are  And they're being forked by a knight 
[03:02:30]  Like I still do stuff  That's enraging  That an elementary 10 year old  Will not fall for  I have a big belt  I won the hip hop chess championship  I don't know how many contestants was in that one  No but I won the hip hop chess championship  I got a big belt  And I'm proud of chess  Who'd you beat?  Hey  Don't worry  It was somebody who's there  Somebody was there  I wasn't playing by myself  But no  I've been playing chess for a few years now 
[03:03:00]  I think it's really a good game  That we should get back in school  The Russians  They had chess in school  And you know  It helps kids be more analytical  Analyzing before they do  I think you know  That'll stop more violence  And teenage pregnancy  Because you could think  Before you do it  Most kids are so spontaneous  Hey smoke a joint  Yeah sure  Hey let's go do this  Yeah there's a move  And then there's consequences  Yeah so they gotta think  A few moves ahead  Forecasting is great  And I'm not trying to  Put it back on myself  But even doing this film 
[03:03:30]  And everything  And becoming a director  I took a five year plan  To myself  I walked away from music  I went to California  I sat still  You know what I mean  And my brother was arguing  Yo you ain't making no money out there man  What you doing  Yo come out here  Get these music  Look man  I got another ambition in my heart  I want to live it out  And I just took that patience  But I forecasted  I knew that if I stayed  On the same path  Who was going to be  At the end of the road  And surely  After about five years  Bang 
[03:04:00]  You know what I mean  Got the green light for the movie  And here it is  The man of the iron fist  In theaters this weekend  That's awesome  That's pretty amazing  And it's a martial arts movie  Yeah  And obviously  A martial arts movie  Takes a different type of direction  Than other types of movies  Like how are you  Kind of  I mean  Knowledgeable about it  Well I've been watching  Martial art films  Since I was nine years old  I'm a big Bruce Lee fan  All the Shaw Brothers  And you know  Even when New York  Had grindhouses  On 42nd Street  I cut school every day 
[03:04:30]  And was in the grindhouse  Next to a guy  Stiffing glue  And smoking weed  But I was there  And I studied those things  But then also  Studying film in particular  This film is not just  A martial art film  If you take out  All the kung fu  You still got a great story there  And that was something  That me and my buddy  Eli Roth  Was conscious of  We wanted to make  A universe that was like  How Lucas made Star Wars  We got a place  Called Jungle Village  We got all these  Different clans  The rodent clan  The lions  Against the hyenas  And the wolves  And they all  Fighting over money 
[03:05:00]  You know how money  Make things get funny  And we was able  To make this whole world  Create all these  Different weapons  And make something  When you see this thing  Yo  You're gonna just  Have a good time  You know  Russell Crowe saw it  For the first time  He saw it  It was  This Saturday  It just passed  And you know  He watched himself  And he was like  He came out  Bobby  That was a very  Entertaining movie  Because it was  Something that  It didn't stop  That was actually  A good Russell Crowe  Impression  That was a really good  Russell Crowe  Cadence impression  I'm working on it 
[03:05:30]  Was it intimidating  Directing him  I mean Ridley Scott  He's worked with  Ridley Scott  I mean he's a master actor  So you know  He's the type of guy  That you know  You just give him  The lane  And he's gonna deliver  You know  Now China was a little  Difficult for everybody  You know what I mean  So he said  The hardest part  About the job  Was the traffic  In Shanghai  And the food  Really  Which I don't understand  How you know  In China  You don't get good 
[03:06:00]  Chinese food  But they have  No beef lo mein  None of that good shit  None of that compound chicken  That's all  We hooked that up  That's American  Remix  Of whatever they had  You know what I mean  Yeah  But no  He was a great guy  To work with  And just  A little tilt here  A little tilt there  Lucy Liu  Also a very powerful woman  And very focused  Came in and did a great job  For the film  And  You did the music  For Kill Bill  Yes I started  Did you  What did you  Do you pick the songs  You said you watched  Tarantino direct  For what was it 
[03:06:30]  A month  You went and watched  How he did it  A couple of months  Actually yeah  I went to the set  And I sat there  In Beijing China  That's what I mean  By forecasting  You know  I saw how smart  Quentin was  You know what I mean  We became buddies  Watching movies together  Just buddies  And he had the Kill Bill thing  And he was like  He's about to start his movie  And I'm like  This guy's a genius  And I know that  People call me that  From what I do  But I want to learn  How to direct films  I want to learn  How to orchestrate  This big vision  And so I asked him  Can I be a student  And he said yes 
[03:07:00]  Now  To get the class  I got to show up  To class  So there was  Filming Kill Bill  In Beijing  I told my buddy  I told my office  Which I had about  20 people working for me  I'm like I'm gone  Disappearing  And I took about  50 grand with myself  Flew over to China  Set myself up  In a great place  Went to the set  Every day with a  Composition notebook  The same notebook  I write lyrics in  And sat there  And wrote down  All the notes  I watched the DP  And years later  Here it is  In 2010  When I'm filming 
[03:07:30]  The Man with the Iron Fist  Quentin flies to China  To see me  Wow  And he's sitting there  By this video village  You know what video village is  So he's sitting by video village  And he's like  He whispers over  He says  Bobby  Do you remember when  You started this thing  Watching me  He said  Now the student  Has become a master  And I was like  Yeah  Nice  And that's all  Through forecast  Perseverance  And persistence  Overcoming resistance  So when you go  So you handwrite everything  I'm always interested  By guys who handwrite  Everything  Because I can't do it anymore 
[03:08:00]  I've gotten too lazy  To handwrite anything  But a lot of people  Creatively  Your hand's probably  Cramped up  Well the right one is  Yeah  I can only hold a pen  If it's got like  A fucking head on it  But it's  It's almost  There's something  That connects you to  When you're writing  And you're writing  With a pen  I don't know why  It feels more personal  It does feel better  I mean  Now I can write  I'm using my Blackberry  Now when I write  I can't write too much  On the iPhones  But my Blackberry  I'll definitely  Get the thumbs going  But no  It's nothing like  Sitting there  With a piece of paper 
[03:08:30]  And a pen  And letting it spill out  You know what I mean  The pen  Come on  We can't get rid of the pen  It's been there  Ever since the bible  You know what I mean  Yeah yeah yeah  What was your life like  Before music  I hate to use this word  But I think I was  You know  Basically living in hell  You know what I mean  Because I grew up  11 brothers and sisters  Poverty  Always moving from  One apartment to another  I lived in Brooklyn  But I lived in about  15 locations  Before I was 15  Wow  You know what I mean  And then we finally  Moved to Staten Island  And my moms came across 
[03:09:00]  A house  She rented  And you know  Back in those days  You know  Mother's  You know  Weathering mother  Food stamps  All that  And she had to like  You know  Alter  What she do  You know what I mean  To get the apartment  But it turned out  To be a very nice  Home actually  You know  And we was able  To live there  For about three years  On Staten Island  And that felt good  And we all had  Summer jobs  You know  I also work as a  Parks and recreation  I put screws in a box  I was a messenger  A fruit peddler  A news peddler  Newspapers  Anything to help 
[03:09:30]  You know  Chip in with the rent  And then of course  You know  You become a teenager  And everybody is  You know  Scrambling drugs  And the street  You know  The street life  Is really starting  To just  You know  Be part of your neighborhood  And you find yourself  In that part  You know what I mean  And that's where  Life just went  Totally downhill for me  But fortunately for me  I had got a second chance  And my mom just came to me  Looked at me right in the eye  I said  Boy it's your second chance  Go positive  And she knew I was smart  I've been reading the bible  Since I was a kid  And you know 
[03:10:00]  I've studied the Quran  Studied living mathematics  So she knew I was a smart dude  I wasn't applying it  And would you believe  And I would say this  To anybody who's listening  To your show  One year of positivity  I went and formed  The Wu-Tang production  And got everything together  And one year  I was headed  To a millionaire  Second year  Bong  Millionaire  You know what I mean  And since then  No turn back  And not only did it  Make me  Turn into a millionaire  Method man  Ray Kwan  Ghostface killer 
[03:10:30]  Oh right method man  I forgot he was Wu-Tang guy  Old dirty bastard  I mean about ten of us  And then I went on  To Sons of Man  Killer Army  Everybody  My whole neighborhood  You're seeing  Guys that was  High school dropout  With felonies  Buying homes  And that's because  We went positive  Is that why method man  Was so good as  Cheese in the wire  Because of the way  He lived it  He lived it  I forgot that he was  He was great in the wire  He was fantastic  Oh my god  A lot of rappers  Get a lot of  Great acting roles  For whatever reason  Can I go back a second  Do you talk about 
[03:11:00]  The second chance  Like what happened to you  Where you were at the crossroad  And you don't want  You don't want to go there  I was just facing  I was facing eight years  In prison  And it was self-defense  Wow  And I got a not guilty  And I just never went back  And that's when mom said  Hello wake up  This could have been  Easily a guilty  Now you know what's  I find odd about  Not odd  But different about the story  You were talking about  You're on Staten Island  You're working  It sounded like  Your whole family  Was productive  Working  Nice 
[03:11:30]  It didn't seem like  Well I grew up  In that atmosphere  So I kind of  Automatically hit the streets  And the drug trade  And everything  It seems like  You were in a good place  And then you  Turned to that  Kind of  Life of a crime thing  Well no actually  No  That is my  It wasn't my neighborhood  It was all around me  You know what I mean  But also  And I'll be honest  You know when you're working  You know when I was  At this time  My job paid me  About four bucks an hour  You know what I mean  And when you come home  With that 85 bucks 
[03:12:00]  At the end of the week  You know what I mean  The sneakers cost 50 bucks  It ain't adding up  You know what I mean  So it's really the lust  For more  One thing I think  We should recognize  About us  You know in poverty conditions  Is that we constantly  Seeing everybody else  Living good  You know what I mean  So it's a natural  Resonation  It resonates  You know you're like  Yo hold on  He got this  She got that  They got this  So you want to be there  Now if I was living  In the jungles  Or somewhere  Or in a hut  And everybody's  Walking around  With their titties out  Titties wouldn't bother me 
[03:12:30]  You know what I mean  I'm living in a place  Where this guy  Pulled up with the Benz  You know this  You know this  This guy  He got a three piece suit  And a briefcase  So these type things  I think is one of the  Main things that entices us  To try to get the fast buck  But I could actually  Tell the young people  Out there  That the fast buck  Comes and goes  Even quicker  You know what I mean  And then the cost of it  Back in those days  Crack was  For one gram of crack  It was  You get 
[03:13:00]  A year in jail  And so that means that  One gram of crack  Costs about 15 bucks then  That means your life  For a year  Is only worth 15 dollars  And kids don't recognize that  You walk around  Three or four grams  Which is nothing  Yeah  You couldn't even  This ain't the size  Of a soda cap  And they take you to jail  For three years  For something like that  So we had to  Realize and snap out of it  I'm glad I snapped out of it  My family snapped out of it  And we found the path  Through our talent  Through music  And also  There was a book  Written by Donald Passman 
[03:13:30]  Called  All You Need to Know  About the Music Business  And I would sit there  And study this book  And then I applied it  To my life  That's another thing  You gotta apply  What you know  Positively  Not negatively  So you consider yourself  Very lucky  Yeah and actually  At the same time  It's definitely luck involved  But it was a conscious decision  Yo  Yeah  I could have easily  But like  Yo fuck that  I'm going out  This nigga  What  Yo  That's  Yeah  That's where you wanted  You wanted to end up  Where you are 
[03:14:00]  So it wasn't just  But through luck  Fell into it  There's an element  To luck in everything  I mean  Sometimes it's  Being in the right place  At the right time  But you have to be able  To  Keep it going  You can get your foot  In the door with luck  But then you gotta perform  And you gotta  You know  Make people realize  That you do have  A special talent  Yeah  What about the crew  That you hung with  When you were getting  In trouble  Then when you  Changed your life  And moved on  And Wu-Tang  Started taking off  Did they come around  How did you separate  Separate yourself from them  Well a lot of my crew  Was Wu-Tang members 
[03:14:30]  You know what I mean  So a lot of us  Got out together  And those who didn't  Get out  You know  Something funny  Happened last January  I'll just tell you  We were on a tour bus  It's two tour buses  Alright  So each tour bus  Hold about 15 guys  Jesus  Right  And you would think  One tour bus  Is enough  Right  No it's two  Because we got  Our entourage  With us  And I took a moment  To look at everybody  And I promise you  Out of about 40 of us  There was 35  That was felons  Been to jail  Or something like that  So a lot of my buddies 
[03:15:00]  You know they came home  We gave them jobs  You know what I mean  This guy  Well you could be  The tour manager  This one  Well you could work  In merchandise  This one here  Well look  We show you how to  You know  To press  The silk screen  These t-shirts  So we put a lot of  Brothers to work  And that  You know  That helped a lot of  A lot of us  Make it through  A lot of the hard times  I mean  Us making it  Resonated throughout  Our neighborhood  You know what I mean  Does that ever hurt  Performers  Like guys like  Hammer  I mean he had  A massive entourage  But guys that make it  They don't want to be  Disloyal to people 
[03:15:30]  They came up with  And they bring  Too big a group  And a lot of them  Aren't you know  Doing what they're  Supposed to do  Not willing to change  Not willing to change  Yeah I mean  You always got some  I mean  It's always some  Brothers that slack  I mean  One time  We had a brother  And he my man  I know him since high school  But he went to jail  For rape  You know what I mean  And so now  You know  He's back home  And he wants to be down  I'm looking at  Like you know  I don't know  You know  I mean  You know  I don't got a big  Qualification  Application sheet here  But rape  Is something  I don't know 
[03:16:00]  If I want  And so we let him  Come though  You know  I didn't let him  Come though  One of the other  Brothers let him  Come  And you know  I was smoking  A little weed  One night  I looked over  I said  You know what  This organization  Is looking a little  Bad right now  We gotta  We gotta draw the line  Somewhere  And perhaps rape  Is a good place  To draw the line  Holy shit  It sounds though  Like it wasn't  It sounds like  You didn't just have  An entourage  Of hangers on  It's like  You put people to work  So they're producing 
[03:16:30]  Something  Instead of like  In Hammer's case  I know he had a lot  Of people that just  Kind of hung out  For the ride  Just along for the ride  A lot of dances man  Yeah yeah  This is funny  You just gotta write  Better shit  Because you are funny  I'm funny  You are funny  I'm working on it  You just gotta write  Better shit  I'm working on it  It's just telling  This shit  It's hilarious  It's fucking funny  The prison  That is  I guess that does  Make your organization  Look bad  When you look over  You go yeah  Armed robbery  Is one thing  But that's  There's a certain crime  It's a limit baby  Gotta be a limit 
[03:17:00]  What about  The big family  Are your brothers  And sisters doing well  Yeah they're doing  Okay  Our family is so  Big  You know  That somebody  Is gonna suffer  You know what I mean  And I just wanna say  Because you made it  Don't you feel  An overwhelming responsibility  To try to help  Your family as much  As possible  Yeah I mean  That's one thing  About success  Is that  Sometimes it's  Never wide  You know  It's usually one person  From your family  If you're lucky too  My brother Devon  Is also the CEO  Of the company  Very smart dude 
[03:17:30]  They had a certain  Program  He served some time  And they put him  In a program  That was  Kind of like  Uplifting  And he came home  With a real  Nine to five  Mentality  And he runs  The corporation for us  So he helps out  In my family  My younger brother  Had a small rap career  As well  Sold a couple  Hundred thousand records  So he did okay  But you know  I have a big family  In New York City  And all over the country  And it's never  Gonna be enough  You know  When people  You know  We look at the 
[03:18:00]  Recession sometimes  And we say  Well you know  How people are doing  I'll just look at my  Family and I can  Measure it  I can look and see  How many of my  Cousins got jobs  And how many of them  It's like a little  Microcosm of what's  Going on right  And you know  Things is tough  Things is tough  You know  When you get that call  Hey what up  Cous  Yeah I just  One of you  Can send me 1500  And you know  You know what  Cool  Then there's another call  Then another  And by the fifth call  And this happens to me  Especially around Christmas  I'll be like  Yo you should have  Called me like  Two weeks ago  Because yo 
[03:18:30]  I gave out  I'm tapped out  Yeah I gave out  The supply  You know what I mean  Yeah how do you say no  That's the hard part  It's like if  Somebody really  It's like how do you say  Yes to one  No to the other  That's gotta be  A lot of pressure  It's almost like  A first come first  Yeah  But one thing  I strive to do  Because I love family  Is you know  I strive to at least  You know  Have a big Christmas dinner  Or a big party  Where we all could come in  And just break bread  And see each other  Because you know  You know  Things work themselves out anyway  You know  My mother  Like I said man

[03:22:00]  So call us up  866-WOW-1-WOW  866-969-1969  On this show  And on the main show  We haven't really gotten  To the phone calls  As much as we've wanted to  This week  You know  First day  Because the phones weren't working  And then  Shit was happening  Yesterday we had to  Analyze EROC  There's a whole bunch  Of stuff going on  You know what the weird thing was  About the EROC analysis  And Eric  I don't know if you got this too  But there is a different audience  Listening to the live show 
[03:22:30]  And the replay  Like I check my Twitter  And after the live show  Everybody's furious with me  And thinking you know  Oh why would you talk about  EROC for so long  Alright we get it  Enough enough enough  Which is fine  That's your opinion  I don't know  Whatever  But then  During the replay  Everybody's loving the EROC talk  Did you see any difference  From the morning to the afternoon Eric?  Honestly I didn't  I wasn't around  During the afternoon replay  So I got  I saw it late at night  Yeah 
[03:23:00]  I think some people  Just casually listen  In the afternoon  Where people in the morning  Are focused  Because they can interact  With us live  And so like in the morning  Maybe they just listen  To the straight  Four hours of EROC talk  Whereas in the afternoon  They just turn it on  And they turn it on  They may have just turned it in  At some point  Or they have it on  They're doing other things  And they're just  You know  Hearing bits and pieces  Well I do have to say  Props to EROC  For coming back today  Because  He was legit 
[03:23:30]  You know  You saw his photo  He actually is  You know  All  He went to ground zero  I mean yeah  He went to some  He went through some shit yesterday  And he doesn't  He could have gotten away  With not being here  And he came in  So  And also  I mean  He ate more shit  Than anyone did  Yesterday  Like not many people  Take a beating like that  And  To come back  You get credit for that  EROC  So today  Today is  Applause for you  I also  What I really applaud  Was you doing  Old Opie soundboard 
[03:24:00]  Today  Did you have that ready  Or was that just  A spur of the moment  I had  It was a little of both  I've had it saved  But today was just a day  Where I was like  I didn't care  I'm gonna go for it  This is the perfect day  To do it  Do you really think  You don't really think  That you're gonna get  Like any  Swayze out there talking  You're not really  Gonna get any shit  I hope not  I mean  Cause I think you  And Roland  People take stuff  On the air  Literally  They do  You've never experienced  That where something 
[03:24:30]  Was said on the air  And then afterwards  They  You get asked something  You know  I haven't experienced  It in a while  But I also think  It's because  Like  Me more than you  I think I've gained  A reputation  Of having a bit  Of a big mouth  I think  No I think  It's a reputation  Of people just  Don't want to talk  To you  Why  Because they don't  Want to deal  With your nonsense  Because I end up  Just coming on the air  And making some  Big thing about it  Or that you just  Talk to them  And they just  Can't handle you  Talking to them  Why  Not in your voice  Not in your voice tone  Or your good looks  Or anything like that 
[03:25:00]  Just the mentality  That when you drive  Something at them  They know they're  Not gonna get the  Response that they're  Looking for  So they just  Don't bother with you  Oh cause I'm  Stubborn as a mule  Yeah  That and you  Take what they just said  And throw that  Right back at them  I'm very smart  I'm quick on my feet  Or deflect of  Either one  Exactly  But I deflect  Either way I do it  I do it well  No I mean  Maybe I don't get it  As much because  I have a big mouth  I just talk  Go on the air  And talk about shit  But I feel like  Especially like this week 
[03:25:30]  Management has been  Pretty helpful  In terms of  You know  Getting us around  You know what I mean  Like we  We had hotel rooms  People have gotten  Car services  It doesn't really seem  Like there's a lot of  Shit being doled out  Unless I got it wrong  Sal  Have you been  Did you get  Did you get shit  From missing Monday  From management  No  No right  No  They were just like  Okay he missed Monday  Now he's back  And he got shit on the air  I got a fucking awesome car  Picking me up this morning  I like a Mercedes S class  I was very happy 
[03:26:00]  This is a first  For you  It's like  You're not used to  The company perks  Like  Yeah  Car service  And hotel  And this is all  First time stuff for you  Yeah  Yeah fuck taking the L man  It was fantastic  I don't know for sure  If this is gonna last  No it probably won't  Roland you've been  Like a little more  And honestly  I don't know  Cause I'm not there  When you're having conversations  But you've been  A little more  Annoyed at the whole experience  Yeah  You're more like  E-Rock in the sense  That you're acting like  They're going to give you shit 
[03:26:30]  And I've been  Kind of telling you  The whole time  I don't think  Management's gonna give you shit  That's not that  It's like  Going through the process  Uh huh  You book a hotel Sunday  And then you have to wait  For Monday approval  When all of New York  Is booking hotels  But do you have to wait  For approval  That's what the  They said  I'll let you know tomorrow  Cause I  I just follow protocol  I feel  And I think Troy  Was doing the same thing  Like  If you just book the hotel  Because it's a  Natural disaster  And then be like  Hey  This is what I had to do 
[03:27:00]  To get in here  But I got in here  They said  I'm not paying for it  But they don't  But what if  Because they  I didn't follow protocol  I think that's the difference  I think you're very  Scared of the what if  Like they won't say no  I know but I just  Follow their protocol  That's what they said  In the email  But that protocol  Is written for like  Travel  But they didn't write  Not for natural disasters  I know but they didn't  Send that email saying  Do what you gotta do  And we'll cover  But if you  You're a person  You don't have to worry  About like protocol  But everybody else  In the whole thing  Their bosses said  Do what you gotta do  Where you're coming  Through Saturday  Well I mean 
[03:27:30]  You can't really  Just say  Alright I'm doing  What I gotta do  I'm gonna get in here  And then realize  That you'll be okay  Like and worst case scenario  This is the absolute  Worst case scenario  If you said  Okay I'm booking hotel rooms  Because this is  What I have to do  If they said  Well no  We didn't approve this  So we're not gonna pay it  Like don't you think  That you could  End up  Talking about it on the air  Doing something  Where it was like  Okay they'll pay for it  Like they will  I don't  And even that's like  A crazy worst case scenario  They've been good 
[03:28:00]  About paying for hotels  And making sure  We're set up  Yeah but  That's because  The weather's changing  Every day  Like if we don't need  A hotel  They're not gonna pay  For a hotel  But if you do  Then they will  Fucking hurricane  In New York  So you figure  Maybe a week  Like everybody else did  I don't know  I mean everybody  Kind of went home yesterday  I was following protocol  I don't know  I don't know  What you're so annoyed about  Well mine's still  In fact  Zone A  Like mine  Noah's still in zone A  You mean your  Your house  Your apartment  Yeah 
[03:28:30]  It's still  We're there illegally  Could you get home  Yeah Noah drove  And Monica drove  You got home last night  Yeah  How was the apartment  Because you live right there  On the water  Yeah  They're still  Cleaning up everything  But when I was  Walking in  The guy goes  They had like  The security  Like the police around  They said  We're just gonna walk away  Just go in  Because you're there illegally  Right  Because it's still  Mandatory evacuation  But they're not  Are they really  They didn't want to see you  Go in and out  They said once you're in  Just stay until tomorrow 
[03:29:00]  So I just went in  And didn't leave  Because everything else  The store  And Dwayne Reed  All those stores  Were flooded  Did you lose power  They just got it back  Did you spoil food  And all that stuff  I threw everything away  So how'd you get food then  If you couldn't leave  I didn't  You didn't eat  I just had a protein shake  Oh no  Before  Before  I went home  Monica and Noah  They drove us to a bar  And we had wings and beer  Alright  So you're taking care of yourself  Yeah  Fuck that yeah  You're not like 
[03:29:30]  Eric you're not like  Like Roland seems very  Precautious about all this stuff  You're not like  Nervous like Roland is  You're just prepared  For the worst  Meaning  Hoping for the best  Expecting the worst  No I'm not nervous about it  I'll deal with it  If it does  Get to a certain level  But  I don't  I don't expect it to be  A big deal  I just think  Some things need to be  Straightened out  Clarified  Yeah  I honestly think  That the conversation  Is going to be like  Okay so yeah  We're all set with this 
[03:30:00]  Right  And you'll be like  Yeah  And then  That'll be it  You know what I mean  That's what I'm hoping  Yeah  I would assume  I was working every day  Like did the two shows  And they went storm chasing  And I would be  Extremely surprised  Roland  If every dollar  Of your expense  Wasn't covered  I'll bet  Everything will be  Covered just fine  I hope so  Let's be optimistic here  We're surviving the hurricane  We're riding out the storm  And I just have to figure  How to get back  I have to probably  Walk today  Yeah  I mean  Yeah cause it was  Last night traffic was 
[03:30:30]  That's what Pepper Hicks did  He walked from Astoria  Yeah cause last night  We left late  And there was a lot of traffic  There was like a  Shiller to people  Waiting for buses  Yeah  And then  Thank goodness though  She drove slow  So you could see  The fight  In the gas station  There was a fight  In the gas station  It was crazy  Oh yeah  Sal you were there  Yeah it was insane  The cops were  The people were just  Screaming at the police  Where was the gas station  It was Greenpoint  Yeah it was in Greenpoint  In Brooklyn  Yeah  Okay  And the line was  The cop was going 
[03:31:00]  They don't have any  Fucking gas  He was just screaming  There's a line for the gas station  Probably over a mile long  Yeah it was probably  Like 300 cars  Jesus  It went all the way  Down the avenue  Nobody wanted to leave  And so the cop  And they run out of gas  Yeah  And nobody wanted to leave  And you see  Like over 20 cops  Screaming  Going leave  And people going  No  He's like there's no  Fucking gas  He's screaming  The cop is screaming  Did anybody get out  Of their cars  Yes  They started to  Yeah and you see  Them call for  It's a cop  I know that's what he said  And they're like 
[03:31:30]  We don't care  And they call for backup  And then we took off  How's gas where you are  It's there  But there are long lines  Coming in this morning  There was lines  On the gas stations  Where route 3 meets  495  At 4am  They were at least a mile  What time were you driving  4 or 5  When I got to 495  It was 5 to 5  And there was lines  There were lines  Wow  Right  Yesterday I'm leaving  I'm heading to  I can't cross through the city  So I have to go through  Staten Island  To get to Brooklyn 
[03:32:00]  Where I-95  Becomes the turnpike  Off the Lincoln Tunnel  That first exit  Is a service station  The line was up to  The toll booth  Where you're coming out  Of Easy Pass  Driving past  I'm like wow  There must be a big accident  And then I see  It's a line for  The gas station there  There were people  Out of their cars  Screaming and yelling  At each other  And they weren't even  At the station  At the service station  They were back  By the toll booth  And they were yelling  At each other  They were out of the car  Screaming and waving hands  Wow  So that's why  I didn't know what happened  And then I got up a little bit 
[03:32:30]  And saw it was all  A line for gas station  Whole Foods  Is the 3 hours away  To get into Whole Foods  Just to get in  Not at the cash register  No they had security  Outside controlling the crowd  This is where like  Shit's gonna get crazy  With this storm now  This is movie stuff  Yeah because it's like  Okay you know  And not to take anything  Away from the people  Who had like  For real damage  And some shit going down  But like we were  Talking about yesterday  Like my hurricane experience  Obi's hurricane experience  Even Roland has his power back  No property damage  Eric's house  No property damage 
[03:33:00]  He's dealing with his family  But Eric's house is fine  Now is when it starts  To get crazy  For the people  Who didn't have to  Go through that shit  Because gas stations  Aren't opening  Like you look at the news  And nobody can get  Into the city  And everybody's trying  Nobody can get on a bus  For Barclays  You were just noticing  Roland that they're like  The subway lines  Yeah yesterday afternoon  They go okay  Subways are gonna be open  Or at least some of them  Will be  And you go okay  Everything's getting back  To normal  And you see thousands  Of people lined up 
[03:33:30]  Outside subway stations  Well yesterday  Someone goes  The yellow line's running  And you couldn't even  Go near it  And then they screamed  We're testing  We're testing  It wasn't open open  They were just testing the line  They were just literally  Powering it up  Yeah  But someone took it as  We're open  We're open  Wow  And then it took me an hour  To get a freaking  Subway sandwich  So you weren't even  Trying to get on the subway  You were trying to get  A subway sandwich  And it took you an hour  Yeah because I need to be full  When I wait in line  And those sandwiches  You know  Let's face it  Most of the time  They're gross 
[03:34:00]  And you still gotta wait  An hour to get a subway sandwich  And the five dollar  Subway sandwich  No longer exists  Five dollar footlongs  Are off the menu  Yeah off the menu  They're sold out  Of that shit  Yeah  Sorry all we have  Is the premium meats  Yeah pretty much  Doesn't it seem so primitive  To be having power outages  Right now  I know  With the technology  That we have  Like day to day  Doesn't it seem so like  Middle ages  To not have power  Even I can't call  From Long Island City  I have no cell service  I could text  If I can't call 
[03:34:30]  Really?  Yeah  Just the idea  That the lights aren't on  And you can't plug in  Your computer  Like it's just like  What?  It's terrifying  Like I thought  That doesn't happen anymore  I thought we had  Moved past that  As a society  Especially for days  Well it's gotta be  In certain areas  A lot longer  How long?  Where  Not Westchester right?  No you're fine apparently  Thank god  But um  South shore of Queens  In Brooklyn  Um  That peninsula  Where my siblings  Were living and everything  They don't know  If they're turning 
[03:35:00]  The power back on  Anytime soon  Down there  What's anytime soon?  And that's  The voluntary power out?  Um  It's uh  I think Con Ed  Runs that section  They're not putting it on  Because they don't know  If it's gonna be  Stable enough to put on  So they're just not  Going to do it  I'd be so pissed  For the notice  I would find out  Exactly where that switch is  And I'd be like  I'm turning it on myself  On  Alright  It's on now  Yeah  I gotta see  And there's no cell service  From South Shore Queens  I couldn't get my phone working  Until I was on the Gothels  Coming off of Staten Island 
[03:35:30]  Into Jersey  Alright here's the plan  Today after this show  We're all gonna find a bank  We're gonna take all of our money  Out of the bank  Because that's bullshit  Now  At this point  We don't need anymore  We're taking all our money  Out of the bank  All cash  But guess what  That's not surviving either  Based on what  E-Rock's telling me  And the way things are going  Cash is just gonna be paper  It's gonna be valueless  So after that  The four of us  Me  Eric  Roland  And Sal  We're gonna take all our money  We have in the world  And Sal 
[03:36:00]  For you  That's a lot of money  And we're gonna go  And buy gold bricks  And that way  We will live like kings  Louis C.K. was right  I know  Oh that's right  He bought gold  But that was like  2006  Six years ago  So it's only gone up  So then we have to go  Find Louis C.K. and rob him  He's in New York  He's across the street  Louis is hosting SNL this week  So we gotta go rob him  For his gold  Yes  Even if we added  Are you in Sal  I'm in  I'm in  But even if we added  All of our money  I think we can only buy  Like a sliver  No with you and Nagel 
[03:36:30]  Combined  We'll have plenty of money  For gold  Trust me  Nagel you're in right  Nah my money's going  Elsewhere right now  Where's it going  To other things  To help your family  Yeah  But they're not gonna need it  If the money's not gonna  It's gonna be valueless  Soon  How cool would it be  If you just handed him  A gold brick  That's what you need  You need to get  We need to get  Well if I did that now  My brother would look at me  And go  What the fuck am I gonna do with this  And you just look at him  And you put your finger  On his two lips  And you go  Shh  The future  We're focused on the future  It's like Rizzo said  What did Rizzo say 
[03:37:00]  He said  Monday  Forecast  Oh  No not the prison raid thing  The other thing  Cause that could also happen  Depending on how things go  You gotta forecast  Eric you gotta make sure  I understand  Your brother's house  Water damage  Your sister's house  Fire damage  If that's not irony  I don't know what is  But  The way you help your family  Right now  Is a gold brick  For each of them  And just say  Trust me  This is gonna mean  A lot more  Than any insurance payoff is  And when they get  That insurance money  You make sure to tell them

What I'm trying to tell you is 
[03:42:00]  Is the gold  Will not be  If the currency drops in value  And becomes unbelief  Yeah  Gold will not be worth anything  Because there's nothing to back it with  So back to the ice cream cake  Wait  I thought gold used to back the dollar  Yeah I thought gold was backing our currency  Not the other way around  He hung up  Gold has been around since  Like the beginning of man  That doesn't make any sense  The idea  Nobody's going to sit there  And be like  I'll give you $5 for this gold  But they will say  I want that gold very badly 
[03:42:30]  I would like to trade you goods  And or services for it  It would take the place of currency  And it will  I have an idea  Why don't we all leave here  And I'll call Discovery  And we're in Gold Rush  The next season  We find our own gold  Because we're only  It's not going to  We're not going to make it  Gold Rush New York  Yeah  It's called Gold Rush New York  And it's where Sam, Eric, and Roland  Rob everybody for their gold  Alright  Now have you gotten  We have to grow beards  I'll be in charge of facial hair  But Roland  No Discovery Channel calls

[03:45:30]  She's like  I miss you  I have no power  Because Westchester's all screwed up  So I'm staying at my  Father-in-law's place  But I feel so bad  Because my parents  Have no power  And they don't do anything anyway  Now they don't do anything  In the dark  So they're just sitting  In their house  And I called them last night  And just let them like  Because they just  My mom just babbles  When you talk to her  Do you feel like  You're in a bed and breakfast  At my father-in-law's place  Yeah  Not really  I'm not around for breakfast  Unfortunately  I gotta go to work 
[03:46:00]  Bed and dinner  Maybe bed and dinner  Bed and dinner  Yeah my mom just like  Babbles when you talk to her  Like she just starts  Bringing up these  Stories  And just giving them to me  In details  That I don't need to know  Like the people she interacts  With on a daily basis  Are just like  On and on  Oh and she was wearing  This bracelet  And I tell you the bracelet  She got it at Lord & Taylor  Which I think it was on sale  You always want to look  When it's on sale  So when I saw her  And she's going on and on  I felt charitable last night  And I was just like 
[03:46:30]  You know what  I'll call my mom and dad  And I just let my mom  Talk for a while  And at least  It'll entertain her then  Because I felt bad  That I was going to a place  That had power  And she had no power  She must have gone on  For an hour and a half  But  That's gonna save me  From the have-nots  My charitable heart  614  You're on after opening  What's up  Hey  A couple things  Roland sounds like  One of those  Multiplicity guys  Like three copies back  He's the Michael Keaton 
[03:47:00]  Who just likes pizza  All the time  Exactly  I mean  It's sound of  I mean  It's just  You know  Maybe you're too close  To the situation  To fully appreciate it  But  Roland is comedy gold  That's funny  The other thing is  Is that  It's probably just  Well that the New York  Yankees weren't in  The World Series  So I'm just saying  You dropped out  Towards the end  But sure  You know what  The real tragedy here is  Travis and Danny  Have to get used  To being at work  Not on the talent  Schedule anymore  That's gotta be tough 
[03:47:30]  For them  Because this whole week  They've been coming  In and out with Ant  So they get to get here  Like a little before 6  And they're all out  The door at 10 o'clock  Yeah  Like that  They've been living this  And then they go home  To the mansion  So they've gotten  To live the talent  Lifestyle now  Ant left  And Travis and Danny  Have to remember  What it was like  To be a have not  Yeah  We were all about  To uprise against them  Because they were the haves  Yeah  I was going to shit  On a plate  And put it on their desk  You were going to 
[03:48:00]  Shit on a plate  And put it on their desk  Take that  Because you're a have not  Am I right  Yeah  Now we're all  Have nots again  So I held it  I mean they got  They got a taste of it  Still this morning  Because they got to  Get in with Ant  But Ant took off  And Travis and Danny  Are still in the back office  They'll probably get  Car service to his place  No  I don't know  If they're going back  To his place  If they were  They'd probably  Have it left  On the talent schedule again  Man  It's just  The traffic's bad out there  I don't know  I know it's bad getting in 
[03:48:30]  I don't know  If it's so bad  Getting out anymore  336  After Open Anthony Live  Is the show you're on  Yeah  Hey  How you guys doing  Good  I was going to  You guys get into hunting  And fishing  I know you probably  Live in the city  But you might want  To take up those  As hobbies right now  So when the shit  Hits the fan  You'll be a little bit  More experienced  On how to get  Your own food  I'm kind of trying  To focus on  Becoming like  A cult leader  And seeing if I can  Get people around me

[03:51:30]  Let's talk about  Something important  I'm coming down there  Next week on Tuesday  What's it going to be like  Not good my friend  Not good  I mean  Panic  I don't know  Yeah there's going to be panic  Unless they fix some shit now  You got guys walking here  From Astoria  You got people waiting on line  Outside of stadiums  In Brooklyn  For hours  For a fucking bus  It's a bus  You know what  New York's going to turn into  You know when they say  Something on the Simpsons  Like oh everything  Will be just fine  And then it's a cut scene  That the whole town's on fire 
[03:52:00]  Riot  Exactly  Cars flipped over  Can you really sit there  And say  You saw  You know  You watch the New York news  Thousands  Hundreds if not thousands  Of people lined up  To take a bus somewhere  And it's to work  Are you really going to sit there  And tell me not one bus  Is going to get flipped over  By the end of the day  Yeah because they said  A million people  Ride a subway every day  Yeah  Shit's going to get tipped over  Shit's going to get tipped over today  And that's just the beginning  That's why they call it  The tipping point  Because shit gets tipped over  I can only tip over a bus now  No don't do it now  Don't 
[03:52:30]  Don't you know  Yelling move that bus  Yeah  Don't get the lowest common denominator  Um  Let's see  Move that bus  506  Samuel  What's up buddy  Uh  Jeremy Big Balls here  Oh good to talk to you  Jeremy Big Balls  I'm glad you properly  Introduced yourself  You're very welcome  Very welcome  Um  You know what  Fuck gold  Fuck ammo  Everything's going to be  All about  Uh  Virgins  And slaves  Think about it 
[03:53:00]  Roland do you know any virgins  Are you a virgin Roland  No  God damn it  I was counting on you  You should call me last week  Well congratulations  That is in order  But yeah  I mean you would have been  Such a hot commodity  Have you taken it in the ass before  Work wise or  No literally  I know you've gotten dicks in the ass  No no no  You've never taken a dick in your ass  No  Okay you could be a hot commodity then  I know  What comes out of my ass  Is not right  You're right  I think more for that  Would be Sal  Oh good call 
[03:53:30]  Where is Sal  And Troy  Because Eric you have  No we know Troy's not a virgin  Yeah he's taken it up the ass before  For sure  You have shitting problems  So you're not going to work out at all  Are you  No  And I'm kind of leading the cult  So you guys won't respect me  If I start taking it up the ass  Right  Our leader's taking a dick in the ass  Right right right  Okay so  I'm leaving  So that's not an option for me  So maybe Sal will be our uh  Sexual bait  Tie up that shirt halfway  Little makeup  Yeah  By the way  Speaking of uh  Unpredictability and shit hitting the fan 
[03:54:00]  I don't know  Did everybody out there realize that  Opie came in and did a surprise show  On Tuesday  Like did we're  Or was it Tuesday or Wednesday  Tuesday  It felt like everything  Everything is matching together  Yeah I mean  Opie was in here at like uh  4.30 in the afternoon  Doing a surprise show  Randomly on Tuesday  Because  We were sitting in his apartment  Roland you came over  Yeah  Jess and me were stranded in the city  And we're sitting in his apartment  And  And  Opie goes  Maybe we should go take the channel live 
[03:54:30]  And he's said that to me before  Opie has many times said  Well we got a channel  We can take it live whenever we want  I mean for god's sakes  The guy's name is on the wall  And  And he says it again  And I figured  Okay you know  He always kind of  Says that  And then we actually left  And we actually got to the studio  And we did like a two and a half hour show  All about the hurricane  We called up Eric  We called up Joe DeRosa  Roland Shotgun  Five beers  Well before we left  He goes  Hey we should go live  We go  Why didn't us girls get ice cream 
[03:55:00]  And watch Bravo  You tried to get out of it  Roland did try to stay home  With Jess and Opie's wife  Just watching TV  And playing with the babies  And eating ice cream  Well they're going to watch Love Actually  And that's what you wanted to do  Yeah  But  The men made you come in  Didn't we  Yeah I just got drunk  Yeah  Roland Shotgun  Five beers  It was great  What we're going to do  Is  Replay that show  On Saturday  What time does Rogan  Usually play Eric  On Saturday afternoon  First airing is at  I think we're going to 
[03:55:30]  At noon  What about the one that's right before Dave's show  The Davey Mac Sports Program  So Dave's on at seven  That would be five  Alright so I think at five o'clock  Right before the Davey Mac Sports Program  We're going to re-air the  And what a lead-in huh  What a lead-in to Davey Mac  The Opie Surprise Show  And then I think also  Since I did the show with Opie  I'm just going to put it on on Sunday  Instead of my show  Because who the fuck wants to come into the city  On a Sunday  You know what I mean  I did a show on Tuesday afternoon 
[03:56:00]  What am I going to do another one for  You've done enough  Thank you Eric  Thank you  Now if you could come in  And just make sure everything is running properly  I'm busy  I'm sorry  What do you mean you're busy  What could you possibly have going on  I've got some stuff  Going through this again  But yeah so definitely  It's going to be replayed on Saturday and Sunday  I don't know  A lot of people have been asking me  I don't know if it's going to be up on Audible  Probably not  But I guess I'll put it up on demand  After the weekend  We'll find some spot for it  I doubt Audible  It's more on demand  Yeah  And Sal fucked up the recording 
[03:56:30]  So I've got to record a new intro for it anyway  Audible is usually just for the morning show  Right  Everything else would be on demand on your app  Right  For your phone, iPad, or online  Stop being a cheapskate  Just subscribe to the platform  When you first went on  All the phones were lit up  I don't know if they took notice  The management  The management  Oh you mean because I'm just fucking firing up the phones today  That's what I'm saying  They all want to talk to Sam Roberts about  The world ending  Which is, you know  Who knows who's going to be in charge  Hey good morning guys  How's it going 530 
[03:57:00]  Hey good morning guys  Hey E-Rock  Got a question for you  What does cum taste like?  Well E-Rock  Wrong show sir  Do you know what cum tastes like?  No, not at all  Okay  I'll take your word for it  740  Yeah how's it going?  What's up buddy?  You're on the air  Good  Okay about the gold thing  Yeah please  People are  Damn they're full of shit  Gold  Has intrinsic value  The reason why it is so valuable 
[03:57:30]  Is because it's  Valuable  Worldwide  You can go to  What 99% of the countries  And you can buy things with gold  That's why it's accepted  Everywhere  That's why it's valuable  It's been the currency throughout time  And  Right  Because look at gold  Why are the idiots  Calling up  Saying that  Gold won't have any value  That the dollar  Doesn't back gold  If the gold doesn't back the dollar  Because Nixon  Wiped that out  Back in the 70's  But still 
[03:58:00]  Gold is valuable  People want to buy it  Listen my friend  You and I  Are going to be the ones  That survive  All these people  That are saying  Gold is not going to be  Worth anything  Well we're going to eat them  Aren't we Roland?  Yeah  And you're going to prepare them for us  Yeah a little sauce on the side  Yeah  What would you dip a finger in?  Like if I was going to eat a thumb  The way you eat wings  Like just to kind of chew the meat off the bone  A thumb  I'd probably do like a nice  Like a jackie angle sauce  Oh  And maybe a little raspberry  To make it a little sweet 
[03:58:30]  Maybe some sweet and sour  And you'll peel the  Sweet and sour is more for toes  That's more for toes  Yeah  You peel the nails off  Before you serve  Correct?  If you want it fancy  You leave the nails on  Then you peel it off yourself  Oh I see  That's the more  Sort of curious  For the rest  Roland  Would you do like a  Like a nice mesquite  Or would you do like a dry rub?  I'll probably do like a mesquite  Then I'll make like a mushroom sauce  A little pour wine  Nice  Eric  Eric you just turned my mic off  With your erection  Come on  We're going to  We're going to talk about food 
[03:59:00]  You at least have to be professional  It's ridiculous  Trying to broadcast here  I did want to  Make sure  That we took some time out  We're still  We ended Jocktober today  We were a little late  On ending Jocktober  Because in case you didn't know  A storm came and destroyed our area  So we had some things going on  A little late  Jocktober ended today  The traditional way  We said goodbye  To the Opie and Anthony show of old  Did Opie and Anthony's Facebook get attacked? 
[03:59:30]  Oh no  I don't even know  We didn't check our own Facebook page?  No not today  Let's see  Let's see  Did we get attacked  Or did we manage to avoid  The pests?  Uh  No I think we're okay  Alright we made it  We did it guys  Not anymore  We did it  Oh I shouldn't have mentioned that huh  Enjoy it on the replay  Wow  Um  What the more important news  Coming out of that though  Was the show that we had to say goodbye to  We played this on the regular show 
[04:00:00]  But you know  We were kind of stopping  We were going in and out of it  I wanted this emotional moment  To be shared with all of you  In its entirety  Uh  As it was meant to be  As today  We officially  Though they left us last April  To end Jocktober  We officially say goodbye  To the John and Jeff show  John and Jeff  The John and Jeff show  I will remember you  Ten years long 
[04:00:30]  Ten years strong  Will you remember me  We're two guys who think  Anyone who steals a shopping cart  Should be deported  We're two guys who think  If you lie about a crime  You gotta do the time  Do not hold a man  About 65% of married women  Said this is the most annoying thing  About their husband  I will remember me  You look at other women 
[04:01:00]  That really bothers wives  In particular  That's me sir  Wow  No wonder guys  We're sunglasses  I am happily married  But we're going to look  And we're going to say  Nice  If you look for longer than a second  Or you do the head to toe thing  And you make a comment  You're being disrespectful 
[04:01:30]  That's straight up rude  You don't do that  You just don't do that to your wife  How is that not bringing a tear to your eye  More like ten years gone  Oh  They haven't been gone for ten years  No  The memories  That we have with John and Jeff  I mean that was  That rivals Scott and Todd 
[04:02:00]  For the favorite show of Jocktober  I think they edge out  Huh  I think John and Jeff edge out  As being ahead of Scott and Todd  You think so  I think so  I know around here  Every Jocktober  And this is what I'm going to miss next year  Assuming we still do this god damn bit  Every year for Jocktober  Every day  Jocktober long  One little boy comes up to me  And he goes  Hey Sam  Is John and Jeff today?  Hey Sam  Is today John and Jeff? 
[04:02:30]  He looks forward to that day  This is  Like you know  As if  You know  The holiday season  Is Jocktober  John and Jeff day was Christmas  To this one  Young boy with a twinkle in his eye  Do you know who that was?  Who?  There you go  Travis  Oh  Every year  Travis just sat there  Waiting for John and Jeff day  Waiting for John and Jeff day  And then he finds out today  There's never going to be another John and Jeff day 
[04:03:00]  Because they're gone  For those of you who don't know  About John and Jeff  That's right  I'm going to take a plug  Go to E-Rock Radio on Twitter  I put up a photo there  As a memorial  You'll definitely want to check it out  What photo did you put out?  It's John engaging in one of his many many hobbies  Is he in Thailand?  Yes he is  Okay well  I don't know how happy he would be  That that's the picture you decided to post  But still  We say goodbye to John and Jeff  And you can do that by  Going to E-Rock Radio's Twitter 
[04:03:30]  Or following Not Sam  Or Rolando's 99  Yeah  337  Yeah hey Sam  I think the cult idea is a great idea  I think you need to rethink your upper echelon  I don't think Eric Pooh Bear Grylls in charge of fishing  And Roland Fudd in charge of hunting is a good idea  They're just the first two people I saw  They were the ones who were in my eyesight  And I'm not good at finding other people 
[04:04:00]  I mean who better than Eric to fish  He knows fish  Eric you love fish don't you?  Fish is good  Right  I mean you got that seagull pelican thing going on under your chin  So it seems like you could store fish in there  And that's something you could bring back for all the cult to share  All the salmonites to share with each other  Okay  You know  And Roland knows meats  Wait salmonites?  Salmonites  Not like salmon  No no no  But that's what you're calling your cult?  I think so  Isn't that a good name? 
[04:04:30]  I like it  Salmonites  What do you think?  Sounds like the luggage  No not Samsonites  Listen Eric  I'm going to have you kicked out of the cult  And you know what happens when you get kicked out of the cult?  Bad things  Roland serves you to the rest of the cult members  We eat you  It's the last thing you want  Lemon sauce  Something you would put lemon sauce on  Eric  Lemon butter sauce  What if we were going to eat Eric's belly?  Should do a garlic herb and wine  Oh that's even better  As a tribute  There you go  If we were going to eat Eric's belly  How would you serve it? 
[04:05:00]  Probably I just  Maybe like a tartare  A tartare sauce?  No tartare is not  Would we bread it?  You don't bread tartare  No would we bread Eric's belly I mean  We could bread it and fry it like a parm  Oh we'd make a nice Eric belly parm  Yeah  Why don't you just go shake and bake it?  Can we make some sandwiches out of it?  Yeah afterwards  We could cut the other half of the belly  Can we roast it and make sandwiches?  Maybe we'll make cutlets out of his thighs  Yeah  And breasts  There's a lot of breast meat on that  Now Eric  I mean we're not saying we're going to kick you out 
[04:05:30]  We're just  Again not necessarily  Just in case  443  You're on after Opie and Anthony live  I mean if you're going to serve  E-Rock breast meat  Would you serve it with jelly or jam?  That's a great question  E-Rock  Jelly or jam  Finally answer it  We've been wondering all month long  I have  I do not have an answer for you  Jelly or jam Eric  People want to know  It's the same stuff  That was inside of Stretch Armstrong  Oh  It's more of a  I'd say that's more of a sticky jelly consistency  A jam  Because jelly is too sugary  Eric has Stretch Armstrong insides in his titties 
[04:06:00]  406  Last call of the day  Yeah this is Scott from Montana  Hey I have a gun and coin store in Montana  So I saw a lot of guns and everything  But what you guys need to invest in  You need a gun to protect yourself  But you need whiskey, toilet paper, and cigarettes  So you can trade those for anything  Scott you want to be a salmonite?  Sure  Okay you're in  Right  Cool  We got Scott  So we got the guns and the gold now  We're turning into Red Dead Redemption  And the whiskey and toilet paper 
[04:06:30]  I'm going to kill your horse  I'm getting very excited Roland  Well listen  We got to go  Sal walks in  And gives Pepper Hicks the salute  Because Sal is like  I think  I think if this keeps up  I was listening to a little bit of Ron and Fez yesterday  And I think if things keep up  The way they've been keeping up  Sal will be doing Opie and Anthony  As his side job  By Tuesday  You prefer not Ron and Fez  Don't you?  Ron seems to like me  Or unless he's just pumping my ego  I don't know what he's doing  Maybe he likes you

Rapping over there?  Word  Did you hear what we said?  You're going to be our sexual sacrifice  Yeah I only heard that line though  What was everything else?
