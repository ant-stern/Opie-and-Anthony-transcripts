<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began by defiantly rejecting the notion that radio should be "nice," setting a tone of irreverence that permeated the entire show.  Leslie Nielsen was a guest in studio, contributing to off-color discussions about childhood.  The Pope's visit to New York and the resulting traffic chaos became a major comedic target, with the hosts suggesting absurd alternatives like launching the Pope via cannon. They mocked a news reporter's on-air meltdown, blaming broken teleprompters and the hosts' own presence.  The show relentlessly satirized the news station’s formulaic use of teaser questions before commercial breaks. This led to a discussion of the recurring comedic bit featuring the “Remove Your Hat” YouTube video.

Movie reviews followed, with enthusiastic praise for "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and scathing criticism of "88 Minutes," including excerpts of negative reviews. Al Pacino's filmography was analyzed, debating his last truly great film.  A recurring bit about a "possible Donkey Kong kill screen" was interspersed throughout, delivered by different staff members with varying levels of enthusiasm.  "Club Soda Kenny" provided a dark and morbid traffic and weather report, sharply contrasting with a more conventional report played for comparison.  The show then moved to Vladimir Putin's rumored divorce and impending marriage to a younger rhythmic gymnast, sparking irreverent commentary on rhythmic gymnastics and the attractiveness of the athletes. A caller criticized the sport, prompting a debate about its merits and the objectification of female athletes.  The Pope's visit and an observation about a high number of Asian women on Paltalk concluded this segment.

The next segment started with a discussion of pictures of Vladimir Putin's girlfriend's allegedly unattractive footwear.  A first-time caller, Joe from Alabama, expressed his addiction to the show.  A game ensued, based on a news story about an Oklahoma sheriff’s alleged abuse of female inmates; callers guessed details of the story.  This led to a long discussion of prison-themed movies, particularly 1970s "prison bitch" films, with graphic descriptions of scenes and plots and contributions from callers.  The hosts then detailed the charges against the sheriff – rape, sodomy, bribery, and other offenses – with sexually explicit commentary and tangents about various films and women's physical attributes.

Laszlo, a Rockstar Games employee, then joined as a guest to showcase *Grand Theft Auto IV*.  The hosts and Laszlo discussed the game's features, graphics, and gameplay, noting the inclusion of Opie and Anthony personalities as characters.  Laszlo played the game live, showing realistic physics, character interactions, and a strip club.  Audio clips of the hosts recording their lines for the game revealed off-script moments and humorous outtakes. The segment concluded with a discussion of the game’s release date and character details.

Another segment revisited *Grand Theft Auto IV*, with Lazlo again in studio.  Audio clips from voice recording sessions were played, highlighting the comedic performances of voice actors, particularly Steve.  Lazlo discussed development challenges, including preventing game modifications, referencing the FTC's involvement with *GTA: San Andreas*. Gameplay footage was shown, emphasizing realistic car physics, pedestrian collisions, and the city environment.  The discussion covered platform availability (Xbox 360 and PS3, but no Wii) and future expansion packs.  Anthony’s jingle for the fictional beer "Pistwasser" was played, and Lazlo mentioned related merchandise.  A "FU Line" featuring angry voicemails was aired, followed by an interview with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, creators of *The X-Files*, promoting the upcoming movie.  The interview covered the plot, characters, and challenges of the show’s return.  Crude and offensive language was prevalent throughout.

The interview with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, the creators of *The X-Files*, began with the hosts mistakenly believing them to be the show's actors.  This led to questions about their acting careers, personal lives, and returning to their roles after a six-year hiatus.  The guests subtly corrected the mistake.  The conversation also touched on avoiding typecasting, Comic-Con appearances, and the show's popularity and longevity.  Laszlo returned to showcase *GTA IV* gameplay with Big Kev and Jimmy Norton.  Norton's inexperience with the game provided comedic moments.  The segment concluded with more promotion of the game, Anthony’s “Piss-wasta” jingle, and clips of news reports interrupted by an earthquake.  Several audience members were briefly interviewed, and the hosts expressed surprise at the large audience.

A segment heavily focused on firearms, with Anthony detailing his recent gun purchases and his views on New York gun laws. He described carrying a concealed weapon and discussed home invasions, referencing several news stories.  A planned interview with Kristen Bell was interrupted by a supposed medical emergency ("Roland is in cardiac arrest").  The hosts engaged in tangents about Pomeranians, guns, and home security.  The “Remove Your Hat” video was shown again. Patty’s repeated walk into a glass wall also became a recurring comedic element.  E-Rock’s bad mood was discussed, revealing internal conflicts and the strained dynamic between him and Roland. The segment ended with a discussion of E-Rock's car trouble and negotiations for car repairs between him and Pat Duffy. A listener shared a story about their cancer experience.  The segment was filled with profanity and crude humor.

The final segment began with a host's story about a hospital stay and his interaction with interns who reacted to Jim Norton's book left on his bedside table.  This was followed by the "runner-up line of the day," featuring jokes about dating younger women. A heated argument between Travis and Sam, the show's editor, ensued, criticizing Sam's editing work.  This devolved into a personal conflict, involving other staff members like Than and Eric.  The argument concluded unresolved.  The show returned to the "runner-up line of the day" and "light of the day" segments, interspersed with jokes and commentary, including a misinterpretation of a pre-recorded clip and a joke about killing Bob Kelly. The show concluded with thanks to the studio audience, and Dr. Michio Kaku’s advertisement was played, with the hosts jokingly mispronouncing the names.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shot Jots, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jots, Opie and Anthony.  Shot Jots, Opie and Anthony.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the Opie and Anthony Show.  How do you do?  Do you play drunk or stroke?  Okay, so Opie and Anthony.  My first time sort of touching a woman.  I don't know what words were used.  First time you picked a girl's nose, what happened?  Her parents come home, so we break it all up. 
[00:01:00]  And the dog runs over, and he's just licking, licking, licking my finger.  This is where entertainment is going?  You're Chris Hansen.  I am.  Have you seen the show?  I thought you were real funny on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listen to me on Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That's a plug you don't really want.  Unbelievable.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:01:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Good morning.  Uh.  Good.  Good morning.  I want to announce that we are officially being held hostage here in New York City.  Bye.  Can someone please send helicopters so we can go home today?  So we can get out of the city at some point.  May I have your attention, please?  We are being held hostage here in New York City. 
[00:02:00]  We need help immediately.  Bye.  The Pope.  The Pope.  The Pope is holding all New Yorkers hostage this morning through the weekend.  We could use your help.  Send helicopters.  There will be frozen zones.  The entire city is a frozen zone today.  So we could wave and admire the pontiff.  The pontiff.  So we could give him more. 
[00:02:30]  The people visit.  So we could give him more of his adulation that he truly deserves.  Help us.  We are being held hostage here in New York City.  Thanks, Pope.  They've pretty much closed what?  All of Manhattan today?  Yep.  Oh, we're talking to a lot of people that are getting ready to come to work today.  Leave now.  Leave now.  The Pope arrives at 945 a.m.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  He's coming in from Kennedy Airport.  And then he's going to go to the United Nations and address the U.N.  So they have to close everything but three feet of the West Side Highway is open today.  Three feet.  West Side Highway or FDR?  No, I'm talking about...  Look at Jimmy Patrick.  That's how crazy it is that all of Manhattan is closed except one little swath.  But Jimmy didn't care until you mentioned something that was kind of close to where he lives. 
[00:03:30]  He didn't give a crap about anyone else.  He's like, wait, this might affect me?  What are you talking about?  Yeah, the Pope is coming to town and...  You know, Anthony, a big field that can hold, let's say, a half million people.  Yeah.  Where would that be?  A nice cornfield.  Probably, I would say, Iowa.  All right.  Somewhere like that.  If the Pope wants to come to America, why not go to Iowa?  Yeah, let the people come to the Pope. 
[00:04:00]  Like a pilgrimage.  Like the old days.  Yeah, where you'd have to go to the Pope.  Don't take the Pope to where a lot of people have to work.  Right.  On a daily basis.  Don't take the Pope to a place where if one car breaks down, it Fs up everyone's commute.  Everything.  Everything.  Everyone.  One car.  We have no room for error in this city anymore.  Here's another big problem.  And you wouldn't think this is a problem unless you live here in New York.  It's supposed to be really nice today. 
[00:04:30]  That means pedestrians come out.  Yuck.  When you're trying to drive.  Pedestrians.  Pedestrians are people that screw up traffic because they feel they can't wait for the little  green hand to cross the street.  They have to wait.  They just have to cross whenever they damn well please.  And it screws traffic up.  Screws it up so badly. 
[00:05:00]  And now with the Pope being thrown in there also.  Forget it.  We're screwed.  Just so people can wave and admire.  You know with the Pope's hat.  And pray.  They could just shoot him around the city out of a cannon.  Because he looks like a ballistic Pope missile.  Just shoot him into a location he's got to be at.  Uh huh.  People can watch him go over and go, ooh.  Look at all these people just going up to the Pope with gifts.  Where's he going to put all these gifts?  Yeah, I was bringing them in Menorah. 
[00:05:30]  Well, it's.  Thank you.  Thank you for killing the person we pray to.  Where's he going to put all these gifts?  That's probably the funny exchange they had.  Thanks for killing our Lord.  Uh huh.  We paid you back in WW2.  And they high-fived.  Uh huh.  Yeah.  Had a good laugh.  Pretended we didn't know what was happening over there.  One guy on WINS, when I was listening to the news on the way in.  He was a victim of sexual abuse in the church.  Oh, geez.  Someone had to have hit the wrong sound effect. 
[00:06:00]  It couldn't possibly have been done on purpose.  You know.  They're still tweaking everything.  We're getting everything ready for our broadcast.  Yeah.  Yes, Anthony.  So he was a victim of sexual abuse by a priest.  And he walked up.  He got a chance to actually talk to the pontiff.  And walked up to him and said, uh, uh, your eminency, your holiness, whatever the hell  they call them.  Um, there's a cancer on the church.  And, uh, this, uh, situation has to be addressed. 
[00:06:30]  And he said, um, the Pope looked at him and, uh, said, thank you.  And sent him away.  It was pretty much it.  But he felt like he actually made some headway there.  How?  Exactly.  I'm listening to this guy going, the Pope didn't care.  He didn't, he didn't give you the time of day.  He's fully aware of what has been going on in the churches across the world.  He's not going to discuss it with some guy that comes up to him, though, in front of  the media.  Not in front of a regular Joe.  Yeah, why, why were you, uh, tussleable? 
[00:07:00]  What did you look like?  Show me a picture.  Maybe it was your fault.  How tight was your little outfit?  Yes.  Oh, see.  Were you wearing knickers?  The news is all about the people visit.  They're already closing down highways.  They got these big, like, cement-looking things.  Oh, the big barricades.  There's the first free zone for you.  Oh!  Oh!  That's all around the United Nations.  Um, wow.  Why, why do they have to close, like, ten blocks when he's only going to be in one building? 
[00:07:30]  How about you just close down the one building?  And maybe the building.  Motorcade.  And maybe the building right next to it and the building on the other side.  And that's, that's good.  That's good enough for everybody.  What the hell?  What is that?  Huh?  You know that they've been preparing for the Pope's visit here in New York City for seven  months.  They say this is costing, um, millions upon millions of dollars, uh, in overtime. 
[00:08:00]  How about, how about you tell the Pope, you know what?  Can't afford you this time around, buddy.  Sorry.  Skedaddle.  This country's heading into a recession very quickly here.  We got to try to save some money.  So, uh, um, we'll get you next time.  We'll get you on the next tour.  You pay, you pay the, uh, you paid a New York City tax, right?  Boy, did I.  Hey, there you go.  Now you can watch it in action to help pay for the Pope's security.  Seven months.  They've been working on this for one.  What?  Weekend visit.  Seven months.  That, that can't cost too much money, right? 
[00:08:30]  Seven months.  Pope has an itinerary though.  Yeah, does he?  Games.  What is he going to do?  He's heading over to the UN to do some talking.  Then he's going to a synagogue to do some talking.  Something else.  He tried to get a comp for the Friday early show tonight.  And I'm like, it's not happening.  Oh, you mean the Carolines.  I don't know if he's going to mention the name.  He just, he's a pest.  He wants to bring in five or six of his friends.  All they do is drink and talk.  That stupid hat bugs everyone.  Dressed like a person.  We get it.  Does he have to go upstairs and outside to wave around that thing of incense?  Because I know you can't smoke in the building. 
[00:09:00]  Because you're out there with people that are smoking, waving the incense.  Imagine that.  They're just BSing with the Pope.  And he's waving that golden thing with the incense in it.  Man, it won't let me do this in the building.  I used to be able to sit at the bar and do this.  Even you, Padre?  He goes, what do you know?  What are you going to do?  He goes, I'd complain, but who'd listen?  They all go, ah.  He's a regular pontiff.  He's a regular.  Yeah, there you go.  Hey, we're watching our favorite comedy show as we get ready for the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[00:09:30]  And boy, were they having problems this morning.  Oh.  And, you know, this is the weird thing about Channel 11 News here in New York City.  A lot of them are huge fans of our radio show.  They know that we talk about them on a regular basis.  They know we love Jill Nicolini.  But we beat them up.  Yeah, constantly.  Well, they earn the beating.  Let's be honest.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah.  Well, today, one of the anchors, one of the newsreaders, completely fell apart. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And as we're watching this, we're thinking to ourselves, they've got to be thinking, oh, no,  they're watching us.  We can't mess up because they're going to acknowledge it.  I think that's why it escalates and kind of snowballs because right when they make a mistake,  they realize, oh, no, they're watching.  Yeah.  Oh, and they're going to talk about our mistakes.  This is a perfect example.  It doesn't matter where you're listening from.  We all have the local news person. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  This is a perfect example of what happens when the newsreader machine breaks down.  Because you watch these news people and you think, wow, they're really well informed.  Then we all break down.  Right.  You're thinking, wow, they're really well informed.  They're articulate.  No.  They're just like, da, da, da.  No.  This is what happens when the reading machine breaks down.  ...in just a bit.  Linda Church now, of course, has a look at our weather.  Oh, sorry about that.  We're going to head over to Tiffany McFelroy. 
[00:11:00]  Tiffany?  All right, Jill.  Actually, we're going to be back in just a moment.  Coming up on the CW 11 morning news, plans for the Freedom Tower found in the trash.  We're going to tell you what that discovery was.  Actually, we're going to go back to that.  Let me have this.  All right.  Okay.  Pope Benedict spent the third day of his U.S. visit with an open-air mass in Washington, D.C., 
[00:11:30]  meeting with several clergy abuse victims.  That private meeting was...  Oh, my God.  Just a complete breakdown.  Without the reading machine, it all breaks down.  I'm producing a news show, did I tell you?  Yes, and that's how you executive produce.  My favorite part of that, actually, is when she trips up at the beginning.  God, what does she say?  Oh, yeah, you've got to throw it in one more time because it's one of my favorite... 
[00:12:00]  What?  I didn't even hear anything that would be that crazy.  Yeah, it's a little more abstract, I think.  ...to come in just a bit.  Linda Church now, of course, has a look at our weather.  Oh, sorry about that.  We're going to head over to Tiffany with Delroy.  Tiffany?  All right, Jill.  Actually, we're going to be back in just a moment.  Coming up on the CW 11 Morning News, plans for the Freedom Tower found in the trash.  We're going to tell you what that discovery was.  Right there.  What's that? 
[00:12:30]  Plans of the Freedom Tower found in the trash.  We're going to tell you what that discovery was.  See, I think she screwed up because she gave away what the discovery is.  It's plans for the Freedom Tower in the trash.  I think she was supposed to say plans for something in the trash will tell you what that was.  Oh, wow.  Or plans for the Freedom Tower found somewhere will tell you where it was.  She gave away the whole story.  Because she panicked?  Because, yeah, because this news station, every time they go to commercial, every single time they go to commercial, asks questions. 
[00:13:00]  They don't just tell you something and say, we'll be back with this story.  They have to add a question to every single goddamn story, and it just annoys the living crap out of me.  Instead of saying, Yankees played last night, we'll tell you how they did, they have to come up with some witty little question.  Yeah, even that would be a question, though, or we'll tell you about, how about this, we'll tell you about the Yankees' victory last night.  Like, tell you that they won, but then we'll give you the details. 
[00:13:30]  But they won't do that.  And maybe we'll give you a little something extra.  Yeah, or, you know, a man was robbed on the Upper West Side last night, and we'll tell you about that.  But it's got to be like, something happened to a man on the Upper West Side, we'll tell you what that was.  Like, they try to make a question out of everything, and it's not interesting.  But you didn't just do a question when you were doing your example.  Yeah, I did.  I said, we'll tell you what that was.  Something happened to a man.  You didn't put it in question form, but it was still a question. 
[00:14:00]  It was still a tease.  Like, it would be more like a homeless man was killed on the Upper West Side.  Guess what was in his hand when he died?  Yeah, something like that.  It's like that type of thing, where you really sit there like, I don't want to do work.  I'm just waking up.  I don't want to answer freaking, like, pop quiz questions.  And you forget about the question.  Like, you don't care.  There's so many of them.  Everything is a question.  Well, we did a montage of the first five minutes of the news today. 
[00:14:30]  Them asking questions going into every break.  Here it is.  Listen to this.  Plans for the Freedom Tower found in the trash will tell you who made the discovery.  What's more likely to cause a lack of sleep, a bad work schedule, or work stress?  The answer in Fit for Life.  The Yankees sent a message to Manny Ramirez and the Red Sox.  Would it work?  Caught on tape college students running away from police.  What they were allegedly trying to steal from a miniature golf course.  Axel Weiland?  The real reason why Velvet Revolver says it ditched Scott Weiland. 
[00:15:00]  Well, we all know what happens when a chicken crosses the road.  But what happens when a pig wanders along a busy highway?  Wow.  That's perfect.  That's pretty good.  Every single one is a tease.  It's a stupid tease that it's overkill on the tease.  When you do too many, it becomes completely ineffective and no one cares.  I just get infuriated listening to it when everything has to be this question that they think people care about. 
[00:15:30]  Could someone possibly be sitting there going, oh, I need to know.  Wow.  Really?  I think it was effective back in the day when maybe during one half-hour newscast they had one big tease.  A big story, a big tease, or something that was a mystery.  Where because they didn't do it a lot, when they did say it, it made you stick around like,  you're not going to believe what they found in Midtown Manhattan last night.  Yeah.  We will tell you next. 
[00:16:00]  Don't go anywhere.  But now every single going to commercial has to be like that to the point where it's watered down.  And us, the viewers, are sitting there like, I don't give a crap about your teases and your dumb questions you're asking me  that I've got to figure out and calculate during the commercials.  You should hear the horrid things, too, that we come up with.  Because they're all questions, so we just sit there, and it's either sexist, racist, homophobic.  We have our own answers.  Oh, boy, do we.  Which suspect did Diane Fossey talk to? 
[00:16:30]  How much do you know about the Pope?  What's that about, E-Rock?  Even if you go to the website to find out some of the more information of the news stories that they were talking about,  there's questions and surveys they ask you mixed in with the regular news.  So the big thing today is take the Pope quiz and find out how much you know about the Pope.  Wow, a Pope quiz?  A Pope quiz, Jimmy.  Nice.  According to Catholic tradition, who was the first Pope?  St. Paul, St. Peter, St. Linus, St. Gregory. 
[00:17:00]  I would say St. Gregory.  No, actually, I think I'm going to write something in.  It was Ted of Hutchinson Parkway.  Oh, very nice.  What is Pope Benedict's given name?  Ah, Joseph Ratzinger, Wilhelm Strauss, Carol O'Connor?  Miller?  That can't be.  Carol?  K-A-R-O-L is Carol?  Yeah.  Carol, and Frank Lahar. 
[00:17:30]  From what country have most Popes originated?  France, Germany, Spain, Italy.  In what country is the Pope's official residence?  Italy, Rome, Vatican City, France.  Out of 266 Popes in history, how many are regarded as saints by the Roman Catholic Church?  359, 101, all of them.  Who elects the Pope?  True or false?  Oh, my God.  Who has time?  These are fun.  And who cares?  This is like taking a pop quiz at school. 
[00:18:00]  No one wants to do this crap.  How about you tell us what all this is about?  All right.  We're just getting started.  Let's say hi to Chris in New York.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good, man.  Good.  Listen, I wanted to know if Colin Quinn was on standby in case the Popmobile breaks down  today.  He'll have to push it down the street.  You know, the Pope, I didn't want people seeing me, you know, pushing the thing. 
[00:18:30]  Colin Quinn had to push Jerry Seinfeld's car when that broke down recently.  And the Pontiff, and I'm pushing, and people saw me.  It's a nice job, Colin.  From Steve, they just said on Channel 11, their teleprompters are broken.  All the anchors are just winging it right now.  Oh, that's got to be a complete and utter disaster.  Nice.  Love it.  Watch out, guys.  So now they're basically doing the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, yeah.  Just winging it. 
[00:19:00]  Just winging it.  And any other news station would be able to wheel something in for them to use.  Not the CW11 here in New York.  They're on a low budget.  Low budget news.  All right.  Our teleprompters are broken.  All right.  Our phone number is 877-212-0&A.  Club Soda Kennedy, what's going on?  We have a possible Donkey Kong kill screen coming up if you're interested.  Hmm.  No, I'm not really interested.  Hold on. 
[00:19:30]  What?  You got to start coming to work earlier, Jimmy.  Oh, no, I got it.  And then you would understand the inside joke that's going on.  We've been spending the whole morning reciting lines from King of Kong.  Oh, no, I got what that was.  Oh, okay.  You just didn't like the delivery of it?  How could you?  How could you?  Yeah, Kenny, you got to be a little more excited.  Oh.  You know, like this is a big deal.  No, subtle.  No, we don't like subtle.  No, it's like a slow build. 
[00:20:00]  It can't be a slow build if there's a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up.  Special Donkey Kong kill screen?  I'm just like telling you, like, matter of factly, like, just between us.  But you're broadcasting it to a lot of people.  Something exciting.  I didn't mean to.  You didn't mean to?  No, I just wanted to tell you guys, like, you know.  You didn't mean to get everyone's attention and stop the entire show and say, turn on  my mic.  Here comes some interesting radio.  Oh, let's keep on the dialogue.  Here it comes.  Hold on to your hats.  All right.  We're taking our first break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there. 
[00:20:30]  Hey, this is Nick DiPaolo.  Tune into my blog.  Hey, this is a fucking one.  Hey, this is comedian Nick DiPaolo.  Tune into my blog TV show from 3 to 4 p.m. on April 16th and April 24th.  That's blogtv.com. 
[00:21:00]  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony, Friday.  Let's get through this together.  Then the weekend will be upon us.  I'm going to be spending a lot of time at Caroline's this weekend, seeing a little Jimmy  Norton perform.  Oh, good.  I want to see what you've been up to.  I haven't seen you perform in, wow, since last summer, I'm thinking.  Wow, has it been that long?  You better have new material, Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, I do.  Of course he does.  I'm just kidding.  Of course.  Jimmy's always working on new material.  Crowd was great last night, man.  I mean, really great.  They're just animals, man. 
[00:21:30]  They're very supportive and really understand comedy.  And the guys I'm working with are funny, too.  Who do you got?  Al Jackson, who works with me a lot.  Al's good.  And this guy that Caroline's handles, Colin Kane, who's so good-looking, I just want to  throw gas in his face, but he's really funny.  I think I might have seen him.  Yeah, he's a funny dude.  Very cool.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  I feel very, very privileged because on Instant Feedback is a guy named Ash from Rochester.  Ash.  And he writes, and you guys are going to be into this, too.

Love you.  Love the show.  Thanks for the plugs.  Remove Your Hat.  The creator of Remove Your Hat is checking in on Instant Feedback.  Ash from Rochester.  Of course, Rochester, the home of Brother Weez, but Remove Your Hat is becoming all the sensation 
[00:22:30]  on YouTube.  But you've got to have that real sick sense of humor to enjoy that one.  We're going to acknowledge that.  Do you?  I think so.  I think it's universally funny.  You think?  I find it, you know, everyone from, it's like a Brian Regan act.  Yeah.  You know, everyone, kids, grandparents alike, all races, religions.  They could all laugh along as a savage just bludgeoned some poor old broad. 
[00:23:00]  Well, here's the thing.  We got thousands of videos on YouTube.  Most of them get a couple hundred views.  Yeah.  I mean, they're just a lot of them.  This one was kind of just sitting there at about a thousand views, more or less.  Yeah.  Because we talked about it yesterday, it's pushing 20,000 views.  People are checking out Remove Your Hat on YouTube, thanks to Ash from Rochester.  Remove Your Hat.  And basically, it's a horrific, horrific story that we did a little time on about six months 
[00:23:30]  ago or so, where it was a black gentleman punching a 101-year-old woman as she got out  of her, well, she was attempting to leave her building, and her hat goes flying off, hence  the Remove Your Hat.  I like how the whole horrific incident has just been whittled down to, hey, remove.  Remove Your Hat.  Well, that's what I'm trying to say here, because I remember when this story went down, there 
[00:24:00]  were a lot of pissed off people in the studio yelling and screaming about this douche of  a man.  But now it has turned into a comedy routine that's about 12 minutes long.  The news showed enough times to exploit it, so why can't we?  I mean, they showed it for a long time.  There's no way you can see the guy's face in this at all.  Or you can see there's a black guy with a giant parka.  There's no way to get a description of this guy's face from watching.  Yeah.  No.  It was only to make you watch the news. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  So basically what you're going to get if you go to YouTube and punch in Remove Your Hat,  you're going to see the video over and over again.  The actual video is maybe five, ten seconds long.  But it is played about a hundred times as Jimmy and Anthony completely lose their minds  and laugh their asses off.  And Jim Jeffries.  And Jim Jeffries, his first appearance on our radio show.  That's right.  He was involved with this.  And this is an ongoing theme that comes up from time to time.  There's about three or four different versions of this, by the way. 
[00:25:00]  Is there?  Yeah.  Well, the newest version, Jimmy came up with that great line, the hat removal ceremony.  Ceremony, which just killed me.  Killed me.  So I want to thank Ash from Rochester for putting that together.  It's becoming a bit of a sensation among the O&A community.  So there you go.  Remove your hat.  A couple movies that you might want to go see this weekend.  Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  A bunch of us saw the movie. 
[00:25:30]  We had a couple of the actors in studio, what, earlier this week?  These weeks fly by.  I'm not even sure.  Yeah, a couple of days ago.  Forgetting Sarah Marshall is getting very, very good reviews.  And we're going to get Kristen Bell, I believe, who is Sarah Marshall in the movie,  on the phone later on this morning on the show, which is good.  And then another movie that's getting a lot of horrendous reviews.  Our paper gave it zero stars and a half star, I think.  Oh, yeah.  88 minutes.  88 minutes.  88 minutes. 
[00:26:00]  Do we have any clips of that?  No, we just got that trailer that we played yesterday.  One review, the big headline was 87 Too Long.  Yeah.  One quality minute in there, I guess.  Do not go and see 88 minutes.  You're going to be highly disappointed.  Unless, maybe you should go, because I've never seen a movie get zero stars in the big paper.  Like this one's getting.  One of the reviewers tried doing this, I guess, tricking the reader at the beginning,  saying that the movie begins very suspenseful, there's a lot of mystery, and he says not 
[00:26:30]  so much with the movie, but if this is, in fact, the worst Pacino movie ever made.  And it has to be the worst movie, because this movie was made a while ago, and they kind  of put it on the show.  Yeah.  This movie's already come out on DVD in Brazil or something.  I think it's Brazil.  Can I read a couple of these reviews?  Oh, yeah.  They were ticked.  And I hate critics, but, man, they made me laugh on a couple of these. 
[00:27:00]  I got this one.  Here's from the Minneapolis Star Tribune.  Preposterous in design, abysmal in execution, and laugh out loud funny when it's straining  for drama.  This film doesn't even honor the lean and mean promise of its title.  The LA Weekly is my favorite.  With its lumbering efforts at black humor and phony pretense to moral complexity, 88 Minutes  is an ugly specimen on just about every front.  The Arizona Daily Star, equally glowing review. 
[00:27:30]  If one is the loneliest number, two is company, three is a crowd, and four is an orgy, then  88 must be the universal symbol for unwatchability.  And last but not least, the Kansas City Star.  It's not often you encounter a feature film that contains not even one believable minute.  Wow.  I like this one.  It's a simple two-word review.  Sandwich.  Thank you.  Someone will get that.  I got it.  Real Film Reviews writes, shockingly inept from start to finish. 
[00:28:00]  Just why?  Shockingly inept?  Al Pacino has enough money where he should have just buried this movie and said, look,  here, here, I will just give you a bunch of millions.  Just get rid of this.  He makes crap now, though.  He makes crap.  That's what he does.  What was his last good movie?  What do you think?  What was Pacino's last good movie?  What would you say?  It doesn't even have to be up to the ranks of the godfather, obviously, but just a good 
[00:28:30]  movie.  Scent of a Woman was a good movie.  That is 20 years old?  How old is that movie?  I mean, that's from the early days of the early 90s.  Oh, my God.  He had to make a good movie since then.  I was going to say 94.  Did he?  Wait.  Maybe he did.  We're getting all his movies right now on IMDb.  What else did he do after that?  Well, I think his, well, heat.  Carlito's Way, I always thought it was overrated, and Heat, I didn't love.  Well, go back to Scent of a Woman, because that's what Jimmy says was the last good movie, 
[00:29:00]  which is way down here.  What about Carlito's Way the next year there, Jimmy?  Yeah, it was overrated, but I would say, okay.  Heat, City Hall, Donnie Brasco, The Devil's Advocate, he was great.  Donnie Brasco, yep, you're right.  He was great in The Devil's Advocate.  You're right.  Any given Sunday, eh.  He was pretty over the top, though, in The Devil's Advocate.  There's that one speech he gives where he's just yelling.  Insomnia could have been a great movie, but failed miserably.  Yeah, you're right, though.  I loved The Devil's Advocate.  Yeah, it was a good movie.  And what was the other one you just said? 
[00:29:30]  Donnie Brasco.  Oh.  It was good in that.  Okay, what year is Donnie Brasco?  1997.  1997.  But then he did The Devil's Advocate.  I mean, that's when he really started turning into a yelling man.  What movie?  I mean, what year?  1997, so right around the same time.  1997, okay, so you're talking 11 years.  I would have to, well, any given Sunday, no.  Insomnia, no.  11 years of lemons from this guy?  No.  Angels in America.  Geely.  Geely was real.  Angels in America.  That's supposed to be very good.  Simone. 
[00:30:00]  Simone.  Where I fall for a computer-generated bitch.  That just looks awful.  I never saw it.  Wait, 88 minutes.  He's Dr. Jack Graham?  Dr. Jack Graham.  Dr. Jack Graham.  That's an awful name.  Yeah, of course it is.  Absolutely, absolutely.  Kenny?  What?  Yeah.  Oh, hold on, man. 
[00:30:30]  Traffic and weather together on the 8s.  Listen up.  Hi, Kenny.  Yeah, hi.  You know what time it is.  Yeah, hold on a minute.  Timing's everything.  Hold on a second.  Traffic and weather on the 8s.  With Club Sort of Kenny.  And I think I was on time today.  Almost.  Eh, close enough.  All right.  It's 639. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  Well, hello, people.  Good morning.  I'm Club Sort of Kenny.  And it's time for your Opie and Anthony.  Traffic and weather on the 8s.  The big downer today is in New York.  That's right.  The Pope's in town.  And that means that a lot of roads are going to be closed.  So if you think you're getting anywhere near the east side of the city,  you might as well pull over and blow your brains out  because you probably weren't using them to begin with  if you were driving around there.  The center lane of the northbound Van Wick is blocked due to an accident. 
[00:31:30]  Center lane accidents are the greatest  because sometimes you get a dummy who isn't paying attention  and could slam into the back of another car.  And that could be a good potential bloodbath.  Pretential.  Pretential.  Yeah.  Arrogant, pompous bloodbath.  Yeah.  You know, in Boston, Route 3 northbound at Henry Pond Road  is backed up all the way to Route 128.  128.  I like 128.  Yeah, because of paving delays. 
[00:32:00]  And with any luck, one of the workers will slide under the big steamroller  and get his legs crushed.  And you know what?  It's great when they go under feet first  because then you get to see the look on the guy's face change  as he slowly gets himself pancakes.  That's the best.  In Cleveland, Cedar Avenue eastbound at East 55th Street  is closed due to a broken water main. 
[00:32:30]  With any luck, a bunch of cars will get stuck and people will drown.  And let's do some weather.  All right.  Cool.  New York's going to be hot as balls today.  Oh, that's not how they do it.  That's not how you do weather.  Well, it's short and sweet and to the point.  Very good.  All right.  You're right.  The Pacific Northwest is going to have thunderstorms and thundersnow.  And with any luck, there'll be dangerous lightning and avalanches 
[00:33:00]  and hopefully that'll affect the census.  And unfortunately, Boston's going to be mostly sunny today.  But on Sunday and Monday, you'll have something to look forward to  because there's going to be rain and showers and stuff like that.  And that's been Club Soda Kenny with the Opie and Anthony traffic and weather on the eights.  Thank you.  All right, Kenny, sit there for a second.  All right.  Now, you want to do the traffic and weather on the eights, right? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  I want to give you an example of how it's done.  All right?  This is how...  Listen to how smooth.  Listen to the broadcasting.  The professional broadcasting.  Listen to this.  Traffic and weather together on the eights.  Listen up for Ken Daniels.  Now, slowing it down in Connecticut on the Merritt Parkway.  It's southbound at Exit 36 for New Canaan.  Accident there reported.  That is blocking at least one lane.  Now, across the Hudson River, George Washington Bridge,  you're inbound upstairs.  Still about a five to ten minute delay.  All the construction is gone.  A lot of tractor trailer volume up there. 
[00:34:00]  The lower deck, the place to be for the cars.  So, keep that in mind for your travels.  The outbound lower deck has been reopened.  Still looking fine at the Lincoln and the Holland.  An alternate side in effect for today.  Our next traffic update in less than ten minutes on WCBS.  Now, the forecast with our chief meteorologist, Craig Allen.  Mostly sunny today.  A warm afternoon, 75 to 80.  But it will drop into the 60s along the shore.  Tonight, fair and mild.  Low 55 to 60.  See, it's very positive.  They keep it upbeat and positive.  Even if there's a lot of traffic out there,  they're giving you options to make it a little easier for you. 
[00:34:30]  They don't say that it's hot as balls.  They make that sound nice.  It's obviously, I'm no like Jill Nicolini or Linda Church.  But like that.  Did you just say Joe Nicolini?  No, Jill.  Oh, Jill.  It must be your allergies.  Yeah.  But that stuff, that's boring.  See, that's the beauty of this show.  You get unique entertainment.  Reviews are coming in.  They love Kenny's better.  The other guys are hacks.  Yeah.  I like Kenny's upbeat attitude. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Upbeat.  Speaking of upbeat, we have a possible Donkey Kong kill screen coming up, if you're interested.  It's kind of busy right now.  Yeah, we're kind of doing a radio show.  I'm looking at a...  All right.  Well, I just want to...  Where's this going down, by the way?  Over there.  Over where?  Like, over there?  Yeah, next to the thing.  Next to the thing?  Maybe you and your mortician's jacket can take a photograph of it for us.  Old formaldehyde fingers.  It just looks like you should be shaking hands. 
[00:35:30]  I'm so sorry.  I know.  I'm so sorry that more of your family isn't dead.  I'm so sorry.  No, I'm not.  I'm so sorry.  No, I'm not.  I wouldn't have this business if it bothered me.  People are dying to get in here.  Kenny.  Kenny.  Why?  Kenny.  Kenny's taking his new bit very seriously.  He's dressing the part and everything.  Yeah, I'm a pro.  You're a professional broadcaster.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  We look forward to your next traffic and weather whenever the hell you decide to come in here. 
[00:36:00]  Bit.  Yeah, I might change the time.  Oh.  But that's going to confuse everybody because now they're tuning in on the 8s now.  Yeah, what if they hate our show but they love your segment and they want to know exactly what time it is?  Yeah.  They've got to linger longer.  All right.  Oh, God.  I'll walk around the room and tell everybody about the Donkey Kong.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  We have a possible Donkey Kong kill screen coming up if you're interested. 
[00:36:30]  I didn't hear you.  I was going to E-Roy.  Eric.  We've got a possible Donkey Kong kill screen coming up.  All right.  Thanks.  G.H.  I already know.  No, no.  Listen.  I was the one that told you to go and tell everyone else.  There's a possible Donkey Kong kill screen coming up.  All right.  Thank you.  If you're interested.  All right.  Thank you.  Anthony.  Anthony, you can't miss this.  There's a possible Donkey Kong kill screen coming up. 
[00:37:00]  Thanks.  Thanks.  If you're interested.  All right.  Thank you, Eddie.  Hey, the Russian president.  This guy is just terrific.  Putin.  Putin.  Putin.  Putin.  Vladimir Putin.  Vladimir.  This guy is a class act.  Yeah.  This guy is planning to leave his wife and marry a nude model.  Wow.  The French president did something kind of similar, right?  Certainly did.  He went with the young broad, the young, like, supermodel broad or something.  Some broad.  She's posed nude. 
[00:37:30]  Well, Russian's outgoing president Vladimir Putin.  Putin.  Is reportedly planning to leave his wife of 25 years.  Wow.  Oh, he's had it.  For a former Olympic gymnast and nude model, half his age, this guy rules.  That's what he should be doing.  Russian women aren't known to age well.  Really?  It's a stereotype.  I'm not sure how true it is.  But you look at little Nadia Comaneci. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, she was adorable back in the day.  Little Nadia Comaneci.  You see her now?  She's not adorable anymore.  No.  No.  But look at that.  This girl that Vladimir is with is some kind of Olympic athlete, if you could call it an athlete.  Well, she does the ribbon swirling.  Ribbon swirling and the ball.  What is it called then?  Rhythmic gymnastics. 
[00:38:30]  How the hell did they get that one past the Olympic committee?  How much were they drinking that day?  Yeah.  We want to take a very long ribbon and make it look kind of beautiful.  We'll put it on a stick.  Yeah.  And then we'll give the girls a ball, a little rubber ball, and they got to throw it up real  high and do a little flip and then catch the ball.  Or roll around on the floor like some kind of a topless rug act while they throw the ball  up in the air. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And then they run around the mat and whoosh, whoosh, whoosh the ribbon behind them.  Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.  Making circles as they run.  A little circles, a little waves.  Well, one of those things.  That's who Putin is going to be marrying.  But she's pretty hot.  I'll give him that.  How old is she?  Well, he's 56.  Uh-huh.  He secretly divorced his 50-year-old wife, Ludmilla.  She's Ludmilla.  Now reciting at a gulag, I'm sure. 
[00:39:30]  What was her sexy name?  Ludmilla.  Ludmilla?  Oh, let me come to me, Ludmilla.  Oh, you sexy Ludmilla.  What could be the ugliest name on the face of the earth?  He met her at like a farm where she was shooing a mule.  She was Ludmilla the mule shooer.  She had strong hands and the pelvis for making many children.  Her hands always come back smelling like mule feces. 
[00:40:00]  Or mule feet.  Well, it's just a little hoops.  Oh, God.  Hey, this rhythmic gymnast also does some cute things with a hula hoop, too.  So that's terrific.  Adorable.  Ludmilla.  Ludmilla.  He divorced Ludmilla.  She could milk many cows in the morning.  Many cows, Ludmilla.  He divorced her two months ago, so he would be free to marry gold medal winning rhythmic gymnast and one-time nude model, Alina. 
[00:40:30]  Alina.  That sounds much better than Ludmilla.  Get that Ludmilla, her divorce papers.  Would you rather be married to a Alina or a Ludmilla?  Ludmilla.  Ludmilla.  Check, check, check all night.  She's 24.  And the president.  She's 24. 
[00:41:00]  Winner.  We have a winner.  You know what he does?  I mean, he's the outgoing president.  Yeah.  I don't even think in Russia you could get away with this.  Just picture Bush.  Yeah.  His approval rating is 28%.  He wants to get that approval rating up.  Do this.  Yeah.  Grab some young.  Divorce his wife there.  Olympic broad.  And find a 24, 25-year-old.  Oh, he's giving Ludmilla the boot.  Oh, yeah.  Kicking her right out the door. 
[00:41:30]  Get out, Ludmilla.  Take that name of yours and leave.  She'll have to go and perhaps find a dentistry career making porcelain teeth.  That's what Ludmilla will be doing.  Ludmilla.  He snuck out on her.  She was at mole removal.  Those Russians.  Jesus.  I put on my babushka.  I left.  And when I came back, Vladimir was gone.  And now, poor Ludmilla, I sit here with nothing. 
[00:42:00]  I want half of everything.  I've hired Dominic Barber as my lawyer.  When Vladimir Putin went to bank to get $40,000 out, there was nothing left.  Linger longer.  I think we upset somebody.  What happened?  Why doesn't Sabrina from Brooklyn give the old radio show a call? 
[00:42:30]  Please do that right now.  What does Sabrina have to say?  She writes OMG in capital letters.  That's oh my god, by the way.  Redneck Gymnastics takes so much skill.  And I say so much skill like that because that's all capitalized.  And then she writes, I'd like to see you do it.  Look, just because we can't do it doesn't mean it's not lame.  And then she tries to take a shot at me.  She goes, Opie, gaining a little bit of weight, are you?  What happened? 
[00:43:00]  I'm 5'11", not even 170 pounds, you twat.  Wow, you fatty.  You twat.  Gaining a little weight.  What are you talking about?  First of all, where does she see you?  Probably on Paltalk.  You know the Paltalk cameras make you a little fat.  Oh, they add a few pounds, don't they?  They add a few pounds.  Oh, look at Steve from Bayshore instantly calling it the Tubby and Anthony show.  You're only 170?  Mm-hmm.  Oh. 
[00:43:30]  Is that bad?  No, I'm kidding.  But how did no one get that?  When someone says, like, you're saying you put weight on, like, you're only 170.  It means I thought he was heavier.  Nothing on that?  No.  I still don't get it, really.  Yeah, because I don't know.  If someone says, I'll write.  You got him, finally.  Because no one, they were very hurtful.  It is.  That's very rude.  I'm glad.  To rope me into repeating my boring points and then shut me down verbally quickly. 
[00:44:00]  Jimmy, here's the thing.  Like, people will, people look at me and think many things, but they don't think I'm, like,  like, E-Rock, chubby.  Oh, now you got a Ford on E-Rock.  They don't look at me and go, wow, fatso.  Yeah.  They look at me and say other things, and, you know, now you could just say that thing  in your car.  Whatever.  Or from your home as you're on Pal Talk, but, you know, but that's not the thing they  would say about me.  E-Rock has a hat on, and the way his hair is coming down over his head. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  He looks like one of those, what are those of those decorative eggs?  He's, you know, when they have, like, the little people painted on the eggs?  And then there's a smaller head inside?  Yes, that's exactly what he looks like.  That stupid Fabergé egg hair.  I'm going to cut your hair with a hammer claw.  A hammer claw.  Let's take his bangs off with it.  Oh, poor E-Rock.  Hey, oh, wow, here's some nude photos of, you don't get to see any naughty parts, but 
[00:45:00]  nude photos of Alina.  Of Alina?  Alina.  Wow, wow.  Yeah, get those up on onaradio.com for a little bit.  See, Putin's just another guy.  But, I mean, there's something else going on here, and it pissed off Sabrina.  Rhythmic gymnastics should not be an Olympic sport.  No.  That's the type of sport you should be doing at a community center in front of, like,  old people.  Yeah.  They would enjoy it.  They would really enjoy it.  Oh, that's very nice. 
[00:45:30]  They would enjoy the ribbon twirling and the balancing of a ball as you're putting yourself  into weird, like, yoga-ish position.  That's because that's what it is.  If you look at a regular gymnast doing their floor routine.  Dude, hold on, hold on.  Especially because there's regular gymnastics.  See, you're taking a sport that a lot of people find cool and interesting.  It's one of the most watched events when the Olympics do pop on TV.  Now you're taking this interesting sport and dumbing it down and giving the girls little 
[00:46:00]  bouncy balls and rhythms.  And ribbons.  A ribbon, excuse me.  And a hula hoop.  Imagine thinking of your favorite sport and taking all the coolness out of it and then  handing the guys, instead of, like, mitts in the field, give them ribbons to twirl around.  They do to that sport what we do to radio.  They just dumb it down.  Dumb it down and take all professionalism out of it.  Yeah, the gymnast, when you see them do their floor routine, it's amazing what they're doing, 
[00:46:30]  the height they get, the flips, everything they do.  And then you take this ribbon thing, and yeah, I couldn't do it.  Who would want to, first of all?  We're watching a montage of this girl on YouTube.  She's very limber.  And she's working the ribbon, and she's doing a great job, I guess.  She's nimble.  Wow.  Putin is going to have some fun with this one.  She just did a split and rolled over in a split position.  This is pretty cool.  I've got to be honest.  This is really...  It's cool, I guess, but how do you know she's doing it better than the next week? 
[00:47:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Could you imagine her naked doing...  No, okay.  Hold it.  Everything Opie just said, I'm throwing out the window.  Well...  This should be not only an Olympic sport, but it should be on every day of the week.  But see, that's not fair, because you're doing what everyone's doing now, and picturing all  these moves naked.  But no, that really is an amazing dexterity.  What a little body I have.  Do you think Putin has her doing some of those moves?  Hell yeah.  In a big, just Russian building somewhere.  The old KGB building. 
[00:47:30]  Oh yeah.  He's putting mats on the floor and just goes in there.  I will be busy for a while.  Don't come in.  Heck.  Heck.  Heck.  He's on his back.  He wants her to jump off like Kerry Shrug on his face, because he has a foot fetish.  Most of this video, this montage of this girl, there's like three people in the audience.  There's no one watching this crap.  One is Vladimir Putin, and then...  I think you get the sexier girls doing the rhythmic gymnastics, though.  Yeah, because they've got to look really good. 
[00:48:00]  They don't have the regular gymnast little fireplug body.  Massive thighs and stuff.  Because they don't do anything else.  The gymnasts usually do a lot of other things that make them have that big upper body.  They need a lot of upper body.  Mary Lou Retton body.  Just imagine her.  Now, these girls actually have a shape to them.  Because they're only doing this, so they have to look almost like ballerinas.  Very tall.  Very thin.  These chicks are amazing.  I'm watching this.  These chicks are amazing. 
[00:48:30]  Jimmy, you would watch this for 30 seconds if it was on TV.  No, I would watch this.  It's cool to watch.  No, if I pass by this on TV, you'd have to stop and watch.  When the Olympics are on, and all of a sudden you tune in, and it's 9 o'clock at night,  you're like, you know, I'm going to check out some of these Olympics.  And then they show you this for an hour, you're like, oh, come on.  Give me something.  I'll tell you, I would watch it as long as, well, until I need to break the tissues out.  Then I'd turn it off.  Yeah, but their outfits suck.  They have nice bodies in there.  I know.  No, no, no, no. 
[00:49:00]  Boo!  That wasn't bad.  Okay, thank you.  I hated it.  Yeah.  I don't know why your nose was stuffed.  Mm-hmm.  For tissues.  My nose is a little stuffed, yeah.  Allergy season.  No.  That's to clean up jizz.  I got it.  Oh.  Ah, one for the old satellite people. 
[00:49:30]  That's good.  They spin that little ribbon around and catch the ball and flip around.  There you have it.  Good for Putin, man.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  O.P. and Anthony.  Good morning.  O.P. and Anthony.  Got an earthquake in the Midwest.  5.4 on the old Richter scale.  They just showed, I think, Louisville, Kentucky?  Is that possible?  Kentucky doesn't get a lot of earthquakes. 
[00:50:00]  That's what I'm thinking.  That happens.  It's global warming or something.  The apocalypse.  Global warming or something.  The apocalypse.  But the Pope's going to save us from that.  A lot of Asians on, Asian women on Pal Talk today.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm just popping up pictures, cams, and there seems to be a lot of Asian women on Pal Talk today.  We've been nicer to Asians lately.  No? 
[00:50:30]  I doubt it.  I think.  All right.  I don't know what it is.  All right.  It's like a little invasion.  Oh, they got cute little bubbles and stuff.  Hey, Anthony, you were just watching.  You were just looking at pictures of Ludmilla.  Ludmilla.  Ludmilla.  Ludmilla.  Yes. 
[00:51:00]  I was looking at his wife, Ludmilla.  Ludmilla is the now ex-wife of the outgoing Russian president, Vladimir Putin.  Mm-hmm.  And he's, as Anthony likes to say, trading way up.  Traded way up.  Look at her.  We're looking at a picture of Putin's ex-wife, and Anthony says that she looks like Shirley Jones.  She looks like Shirley Jones.  From the Partridge family.  Wow.  All bloated.  Bloated, and he traded her in for a 24-year-old rhythmic gymnast. 
[00:51:30]  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  And there's the difference.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  Wow.  Way.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Good for you, Vlad.  Hey, let's say hi to Christine from Long Island.  Christine.  Hi.  How are you?  Pretty good, Christine.  How are you?  Hey.  Good.  I just wanted to say that...  Am I getting fat?  What?  Aw.  Oh, sorry.  What?  I just wanted to say that rhythmic gymnastics is a cop-out. 
[00:52:00]  I was a gymnast for 15 years, and if you want to dance around with ribbons and balls,  don't call yourself a gymnast.  Yeah, but I have a problem with the Olympic committee.  They decided that this is a legit event for the Olympics.  I think that's ridiculous, right?  Ridiculous.  I think what happened, you know, they were hoping, like, gymnasts would be hot, but like 
[00:52:30]  Anthony said, they started looking like fire hydrants.  They got the big, huge thighs.  They got the cute faces, but they all have a weird, like, Dorothy Hamill-looking haircut.  And I think this was the Olympics' way of getting sexiness into the Olympics.  Big upper body they have.  They have very strong shoulders, very broad shoulders, and then their body is very manly,  very V-like, goes down to very muscular buttocks, and the only real thrill is camel toe. 
[00:53:00]  It's pretty much the only thrill you get in the Olympics watching that.  Right, but then with the rhythmic gymnast, they look a little sexier.  Oh, God, is she sexy.  See, yeah, every picture of this Vladimir Putin's new chick is better than the last.  Why are those flowers there?  I can't see her breasts or her vagina.  They're in the wrong place.  They're positioned so you can't see anything.  It's an artistic shot, James.  There's probably bees all over her breasts.  Probably standing in front of a beehive. 
[00:53:30]  Anthony's right.  Not everything's about just being totally nude radio.  She's hiding her noughties with flowers.  How would the flowers hide, like, her ankles and eyes?  So we could see the breasts and private parts.  She's hiding the goodest of the goodness.  You've got to cover up the goodness.  It wouldn't be the goodness if you didn't cover it up.  If women just walked around completely nude, it would take maybe a year or two, but then  they would be like, ah, do you honestly think, because I thought that, do you think if women 
[00:54:00]  walked around completely topless for just millennia, they walk around topless, but always  wear gloves up to the elbows, when they peel that glove off, would you just be like,  You would lose your mind.  You'd lose your mind seeing, like, a bare hand or something, a bare women's hand.  Because there was a time women weren't allowed to wear skirts and stuff, and they had their  legs covered.  You would think a leg's a leg, but then... 
[00:54:30]  Legs are still very sexy when you uncover them.  But there was a time we didn't know that because they were always covered up, and then the first  skirt that appeared on the streets, people lost their freaking minds.  Now you see skirts, and they have to have hot legs.  But back then, if a fat woman was wearing a skirt, you were like, oh my god, I'm going to  lose my mind.  But the thing with the white gloves, I like the theme, and it tells a lot about a girl,  because the girl who's wearing the white gloves, you can tell if she's a goer if the pointer  finger's brown.  What? 
[00:55:00]  She's got special gloves.  Of course.  Come in all kinds of different colors.  She gets it.  She knows how to add to the experience.  You don't have to ask her.  But you wouldn't, but then breasts wouldn't take on that, you know, sexuality that they have.  Well, my brother, he went down to Mardi Gras, family go to Mardi Gras, and he came back  with, I'm not even kidding, two to three hundred pictures of girls topless.  And he said to me, he learned something while being down in Mardi Gras, that most girls' 
[00:55:30]  breasts are disgusting.  Yeah, well, the ones that are flashing down there, they're flopping out.  Maybe it was more because of the type of woman that was flashing down there.  Yeah, but you will stop at the really good ones and take a look at those pictures.  A really good set.  Wow.  But most have a bit of a problem.  Yeah.  The old flapjack syndrome. 
[00:56:00]  You know, that's why they invented the bra, to keep everything looking like there's something  happening.  Yeah.  Damn.  That's something, I know, we're just scrolling through.  Pictures of.  Putin's new chippy pictures.  Yeah.  Heels are ugly.  She's ugly heels.  Wow.  Does she?  She's running around on the mat, Jimmy.  Yeah, she's a gymnast.  Fairfoot is.  You got to give her that.  Well, then put some gloves on your feet.  Tape bananas to them and do a funny video.  Tape tiny little yarmulkes to the heels or something.  Just cover them up. 
[00:56:30]  Awful.  A lot of me are going to be rubbing lotion into those things.  I don't have to worry about it.  They'll look great.  Yeah, let's say hi to Joe in Alabama.  Joe!  Alabama, man!  Yeah.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I just wanted to let y'all know I'm a first-time caller, and I just got an exit for Christmas.  And I freaking love this show.  Yeah, I just got one for Christmas.  And I heard of y'all before, but I didn't really know anything about the show.  Wow.  So you've been listening for, what, four months now, almost? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, almost four months.  I'm addicted to it.  I appreciate that, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  In the four months you've been listening to the Opie and Anthony show, what would you say  was the funniest thing you heard from this fine radio show?  Good question.  Well, that's fine.  Live and learn, new fan.  Oklahoma sheriff charged with using inmates as anyone? 
[00:57:30]  As?  As!  As!  Sex slaves?  No.  Damn it!  I read the story.  Why are you wrecking my bit?  I'm trying to do what the news does, because then everyone in their cars goes, uh, uh, uh.  Let's see what's on Z100.  Damn.  My guess was different.  What was yours, Jimmy?  Oh, what was yours?  Wait, let me set it up again.  Oklahoma sheriff charged with using inmates as anyone?  Licensed plate makers.  Ooh. 
[00:58:00]  You didn't raise your hand.  Oh.  You gotta follow the rules.  You wanna try again?  Phrase it in the form of a question.  You wanna try again?  Okay.  All right.  Iraq, you can play, too.  Your mic's on.  Yeesh.  Oklahoma sheriff charged with using inmates as?  Puerto Ricans!  Oh.  I don't think, uh, that.  Kenny, where are you?  Traffic and weather on the, what, fives now? 
[00:58:30]  Uh, authorities have charged a western Oklahoma sheriff with, uh, coercing and bribing.  This is a hot story.  This is the hot story of the day.  We're gonna try to get a hotter story, but I think this is it right here.  After saying that, this had better be at a woman's facility.  Oh, crap.  I didn't, I didn't read a head.  Oh, no, Opie.  You best skim through that because if this is a gentleman's facility, and you've called  it hot, yeah, Oz, oh boy, most schlong in any opening of a TV show. 
[00:59:00]  They haven't.  They won an Emmy for that.  My pet peeve, as far as Hollywood goes, they haven't made a good prison bitch movie in  a long time.  Yeah, kind of, uh, it's considered very 70, I think.  If you want, yeah, you know what, though?  Get, uh, Quentin Tarantino or one of those guys that, you know, one of these directors  that is doing the retro thing.  Yeah.  What was the retro movie that Quentin did with the other dude? 
[00:59:30]  Oh, of course.  The, uh, help me out.  The, uh, the what?  Planetary and all that, but what was it called?  Grindhouse.  Grindhouse.  Go old school.  Get us a prison bitch movie that goes all out like the old days.  I'm telling you, it'd be the hottest movie in the country.  Laundry room, uh, mop scene.  All that stuff.  Things like that.  That is a genre that should not go away.  Yeah.  What was the last good prison bitch movie, Iraq?  That's your, your assignment for the next 15 minutes.  Caged Heat was very sexy.  Caged Heat was a good'un. 
[01:00:00]  There wasn't a bad one that was made in the 70s, Jimmy.  Not a bad one that was made.  Oh, yeah.  Just.  But then they started using, like, fake prisons and it just, ugh.  Yeah, the old lesbian forced scene, I love that.  No, I don't want that.  Yeah.  But then I do.  But then I do.  I do want it.  I do want this.  Don't make me horror.  They go from screaming to enjoying.  Authorities have charged a western Oklahoma sheriff with coercing and bribing. 
[01:00:30]  Ready?  Mm-hmm.  Thank God.  Female inmates.  So he could use them in a sex slave operation, run out of his jail.  How hot is this?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  That's pretty good.  Remember some of these prison bitch movies where all of a sudden, like, the girls, they  got to do some of the chores at the sheriff's house because they were good girls in prison  and then all hell would break loose at the sheriff's house?  Yeah.  Lesbianism.  Good one.  And wet t-shirt contests. 
[01:01:00]  You know, it was a good scene on Oz, I think.  I think it was Oz.  It was some woman that was on death row.  And, um, she backed herself up to the bars and, uh, a guard came up and, uh, you know,  took care of business.  Yeah.  That was, there's just something so wrong and filthy about it.  That's, that's pretty hot.  Yeah.  That's really hot.  Were you yelling lucky girl?  Yeah.  We should make a prison bitch movie. 
[01:01:30]  How much money do you think we could bankroll?  It could be, uh, 10, 20 bucks.  Custer County.  Custer County.  It's even in like, just, it's, it just, it just drips redneck this story.  Yeah.  We do things different here in Custer County.  Redneck prison bitches.  This story has it all.  Uh, Custer County Sheriff Mike Burgess.  I'm Mike Burgess.  Resigned Wednesday.  Just as state prosecutors filed 35 felony charges against them. 
[01:02:00]  Is that a felony?  Come on.  Everyone's happy.  This guy rules.  This guy rules against him, including 14 counts of second degree, well, rape.  That gets the girls a little upset out there.  Uh, seven counts of forcible oral sodomy and five counts of bribery by a public official.  That's funny.  I thought, I thought we could take care of it right here in Custer County. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  You know, a message left at Burgess's home Thursday was not immediately returned.  Yeah.  He's going to get right on the phone and discuss 35 felony accounts.  Hello media.  Yes.  I'd like to talk, uh, about this before I go to court on 35 felonies.  Uh, among other things, Burgess is accused of having sex with a female drug court participant  who was in his custody.  Uh, federal lawsuit filed in October claims Burgess told one drug court participant he would 
[01:03:00]  have her sent to prison if she didn't, uh, comply with his sexual demand.  Wow.  Nice.  A nice use of power.  The lawsuit filed by 12 former inmates alleges the sheriff's employees had them.  This is where it gets really good.  Had them engage in wet t-shirt contests.  At the prison.  That's a fun prison.  What girls don't want to do that if they're in prison?  Um, kind of breaks them.  Oh my God.  Go back to that.  Iraq.  What movie is that from? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Women in fury.  Women in fury.  It should be women in, uh, Brazilian waxing place.  Women in furry.  It's pretty hot, though.  The girls are in prison.  They're doing a little, this one girl looks like she's really-  She's being pinned down.  She's getting pinned down.  She's completely naked.  Completely.  And the other girls that are participating, their, uh, their, uh, prison garb is, uh, is,  is loosely on their bodies.  Apparently they're torturing her with a muskrat.  No, no, no, no.  That they're letting crawl on her body. 
[01:04:00]  No, no, no.  No, that's not a muskrat.  No.  Sure looks like one.  Is that a, are they, are they, ah, nevermind.  I messed it up.  I was laughing at my own stupidity.  I was trying to go with a Harry Leach joke and it just didn't come out right.  All right.  Listen, so.  Oh, wait, is that a girl?  Oh, that's the, that's the prison guard.  Oh, gee.  Is that what?  That's more from women and fury.  Wow.  Look at her. 
[01:04:30]  How does she have such a, um, distinct bikini tan line?  If she's in prison, she's in prison.  She's got huge cans and you can just see where this little bikini was covering up.  This tiny little triangle.  Yeah.  Covering up the naughty area.  Naughty.  The area of the breast that you can't see in public.  I guess they allow them to sunbathe when they're doing five to ten.  And you got the prison guard pinning her down.  But now the, the prisoner is kind of getting into it. 
[01:05:00]  Cause now she's helping her unbutton her, uh, her prison uniform.  Yeah.  All right.  Back to, uh, they're going to scissor back to this Burgess guy.  Uh, so, uh, where are we at?  Okay.  So 12 former inmates alleges the sheriff's employees had them engage in wet t-shirt contests and offered cigarettes to those who would flash their bosoms.  You know, cigarettes, um, still money in prison.  Uh, let's see.  One prisoner alleged she became a jail trustee with more freedom after agreeing to perform a sex act on Burgess. 
[01:05:30]  Ooh.  But lost that status when she later refused.  Ah.  Uh, Burgess also faces two counts each of sexual battery.  Rape by instrumentation.  Whoa.  Uh, nightstick.  And subordination of perjury in one count each of engaging in a pattern of criminal offense, indecent exposure, and kidnapping.  He could be sentenced to 467 years in prison. 
[01:06:00]  How do you kidnap someone in prison?  I don't get that part, but.  I don't know.  All right.  I guess the law's the law.  I think it's a technicality.  Uh, let's go to, uh, Michelle in Texas.  Michelle.  Hi, guys.  I was a flight attendant up until about a month ago, and those girls down in Louisiana going to Mardi Gras are pretty hideous.  Yeah.  I think I gotta adjust what my brother was saying.  I think he was saying the girls that flash in Mardi Gras.  The girls that flash in Mardi Gras, I swear, it's gotta be 90, between 90 and 93% awful. 
[01:06:30]  Mm-hmm.  And then occasionally you'll find something good, and you'll wail beads at her face.  Just pitiful.  We're always down in, um, you know, down Bourbon Street.  Right.  And it's just really, really, I was like, I can do more.  And you get a lot of girls down there that want to show off their, uh, their, their, their boob jobs and stuff.  But, uh, call me crazy, but I like to see a little, uh, a little heaviness when, uh, when that, uh, when you remove the, uh, the shirt. 
[01:07:00]  You don't want to, like, see the removal of the shirt and nothing moved whatsoever.  For some reason, that is a huge turnoff to me.  It's, you know, you get.  I'm not looking for a major, whoa.  Bah-vong, bah-vong.  But just a little, just a little, like, wow, I don't even want to use the word.  But how about this?  A very slight drop.  Just acknowledge that there's some heaviness.  A little chukunk.  Just a little.  Chukunk.  I, uh, I'll tell you the, uh, some of the worst breasts you'll ever see. 
[01:07:30]  And they love flashing.  And I'm not saying everything.  Shut up.  I'm not saying everything, but I'm, I like every woman that, uh, is a biker.  But biker bitches have some of the worst breasts ever.  Really?  Yeah.  They're always flashing at those, you know, like Unadilla and those, those bike shows and things like that.  And they are so flapjack-y.  Uh, they're just horrible to look at. 
[01:08:00]  Well, I've seen pictures and like Easy Rider and things like that.  That's a lot of road miles.  A lot of vibrating.  I think it might be the vibrating without the bra.  A lot of vibrating is breaking down the material inside the boob area.  I think you're right, Dr. Hughes.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you.  Now you get phone calls.  I ride a bike and I got, I know.  I'm not saying all of them.  Uh, Bill from Waterford's got it.  You're looking for breast heft.  Oh, heft.  You need a little heft to it.  Just a little heft.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, let's say hi to Matt in Massachusetts. 
[01:08:30]  Matt.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, uh, hey, Anthony, you're right about those biker bitches coming from Worcester, Massachusetts.  Yep.  I've seen flying of them and, uh, yuck, to say the least.  Yeah.  The, uh, the ultimate by, uh, the ultimate, uh, prison bitch movie, Bad Girls Dormitory  with Wendy Williams from the Plasmatics.  You guys remember that flick?  Bad Girls Dormitory.  How do you get these films?  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  USA Up All Night.  They used to play it, like, Saturday night.  You know what's funny?  As you're saying that, go back one page there, Iraq. 
[01:09:00]  Uh, I'm seeing reviews for some of these movies.  Caged Fury, right?  1989.  Uh, it was the other one, actually.  Whatever.  Uh, it's only, only getting three out of four stars.  But then it writes, great nudity.  Oh, wow.  That should be four stars, then.  Yeah, the storyline's lacking a little bit, but great nudity.  Yeah, who cares?  Yeah, exactly.  I think every one of these movies should just get four stars.  Uh, let's say hi to David in Missouri.  David.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  I've got two sexy prison movies for you. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Midnight Express and Sleepers.  You're a sick bastard.  Midnight Express.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I gotta agree with you, Opie.  I don't like the fake breasts.  They look like cartoon eyeballs.  That's kind of true.  Cartoon eyeballs?  Yeah.  That's pretty good, man.  And you know, when they go to an old folks home, like when they're in their 70s or whatever, 
[01:10:00]  and everything up top still looks nice and perky and the rest of it's all wrinkled out and  blech.  You know what?  I mean, uh, boob jobs, like in, when, when women have clothes on and they have a nice  boob job, oh my God, it'll drive you nuts.  But then when they, like, take off their shirts and stuff, there's no movement whatsoever.  And that's, for me, that's a huge turnoff.  Yeah, you need, uh, look at this, sorry, I can't even, I'm trying to talk here, E-Rock.  What is that, E-Rock? 
[01:10:30]  This movie's called Ilsa the Wicked Warden.  Well, she does look wicked.  Oh my God.  Ilsa.  E-Rock, you have a job this weekend.  Big busty German girl.  You have to get me a variety of prison bitch films, and I want them in my hand on Monday.  I need, what is this one called?  Ilsa the Wicked Warden.  What an awful massage she's giving.  She's giving the little, uh, karate chop, uh, massage, like, sideways karate chop all  the way up the back.  Sitting on someone's ass. 
[01:11:00]  Look, look.  Rat, too.  Is there an innocence in this scene, even though they're both naked, like, like, they don't  know what's going to happen?  Well, the warden is getting the massage.  Yeah.  And the prisoner's doing it against her will.  Uh.  Hey, you see the synopsis?  That, that's against her will?  She's not even moving.  No, she's just laying there, kind of relaxed.  I love how, uh, this is why I love Mr. Skin.  And they'll tell you, uh, how much skin time in each movie.  Yeah.  For example, this movie has 23 minutes of skin time.  That's a lot.  That's pretty good. 
[01:11:30]  Uh.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Why zoom in on that face?  I know.  The face is awful.  She has amazing natural breasts, and they went right for the face.  All right, listen.  Synopsis of this.  Gazongas and glutes are on display.  Gazongas.  As Lena Romey removes Diane's gown and gives her the lamest massage in movie history.  Put some effort in, girlfriend.  That's the synopsis of this, uh, fine movie. 
[01:12:00]  Yes, uh, young Sam.  The Elsa movies are the best.  There's a whole series of them.  That's the Wicked Warden.  But then there's also Elsa, She-Wolf of the SS.  Oh, that sounds like something I'd like to see.  And Harem of the Oil Sheiks, where she just has to find girls and kidnap them and then  prepare them for the, uh, sheiks.  Yeah.  Right, because they, uh, you know, they like a lot of women.  Right.  Yeah.  A harem.  And they're all full of nudity, terrible stories.  Any good lesbo action?  Yeah, and all of them.  Hey, uh, we got another synopsis. 
[01:12:30]  There's another scene from that same movie.  Which movie again there, E-Rock?  Ilsa the Wicked Warden.  There's that, uh, that muskrat again.  Well, how does that little animal make it into all these movies?  Oh, God, those are nice.  Those are some nice bosoms.  So, the synopsis of this scene.  More, uh, can you say that word, or are they going to dump out it?  We're all right with that?  Uh.  Uh, more, uh, you know, more, you know what's.  What, breasts?  Well, I know, but then if it gets into that titillating. 
[01:13:00]  I don't think you'd say that.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Look at them going at it in the shower.  Oh, yeah.  And then there's, like, five girls totally naked dancing around in the shower as two girls  are struggling on the shower floor.  Wow, they're wrestling on the shower floor.  This could be the best movie I've ever seen in my life.  It's a better fight than Cena than Tango in cash, I'll tell you that much.  Look at this.  They're just nude wrestling in a shower.  What the hell is going on? 
[01:13:30]  Why didn't this win the Oscar?  Hey, um, what's that game where you had to, like, fill in the blanks?  It was, uh.  Mad Libs?  Mad Libs.  All right, we're going to do a little Mad Libs here.  Mad Libs, 50 years old, by the way, yesterday.  Really?  Can we put the synopsis on, who cares, uh, synopsis of this scene we're watching, Anthony?  More blanks than you could, uh, poke a blank at.  Play along at home. 
[01:14:00]  Play Mad Libs at home.  As, uh, Tanya, or Tanya, is forced to wash Lena Romay's blank in the shower.  Yeah, there she is.  Then some serious, uh, blank-legged blank as they drop the blank and blank.  Awesome scene.  This is probably one of the best prison movie scenes I've ever seen.  She shoves the bar of soap in her mouth, and then they go, uh, fighting. 
[01:14:30]  No, Steve, Steve, they're women.  Just don't even bother.  You know how the news, Anthony, you know how the news, like, uh, does a question going into  every break?  Uh-huh.  I'm going to give the answers to the Mad Libs after the break.  So this is what you need.  Ready?  More.  Hold on, I got to write it down so I get this right.  All right, more blanks than you could poke a blank at.  Mm-hmm.  Hold on.  The answers will be right after the break, as soon as we come back. 
[01:15:00]  As, uh, Tanya is forced to wash Lena Romay's blank in the shower.  Mm-hmm.  Then some serious, uh, which one can, uh, the first part.  Blank, the first part?  Okay.  Then some serious blank nudity.  Hold on.  Wow.  Because I want to get this Mad Lib right. 
[01:15:30]  As they drop the gloves and scrap.  Awesome scene.  I will give you the Mad Libs after the break, okay?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Okay.  Hey, good morning.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We got a busy show.  We got Laszlo coming in in just a few minutes here to talk about the, the brand new Grand  Theft Auto.  We're all in it.  And I think he's got some audio samples that we can play for everybody. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, uh, Ant, the answers to the, uh, the Mad Libs.  Yes.  Breasts.  Mm-hmm.  Meat flute.  Uh-huh.  Poodle.  Poodle.  All right.  And open-legged.  All right.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  Pencil that in.  Absolutely.  Traffic and weather on the eights with Club Soda Kenny. 
[01:16:30]  It's time?  Yeah, Kenny, it's time.  That was your intro.  Oh, hi.  Good morning.  I'm Club Soda Kenny, and it's time for your Opie and Anthony traffic and weather on the  eights.  New York City traffic?  Forget about it.  You know, that papal guy, he, he messed everything up.  Atlantic traffic?  Uh, that's all screwed up. 
[01:17:00]  Uh, Rockland County, there's an accident on the Taconic State Parkway southbound after James  buried State Park.  Uh, so far, no bodies have been recovered, but there's a lot of woods to search, and I suggest  they start looking up in the trees if anybody got thrown from their car.  The Holland Tunnel inbound, heavy traffic due to an accident northbound on 440.  Traffic's jammed up for miles because of rubbernecking, of course. 
[01:17:30]  You know, people love looking at dead bodies, especially since there's reports that somebody's  head cracked against a windshield like a melon.  And I got some breaking news.  Yeah, breaking news?  Yeah, this is legit.  An earthquake measured 5.4 in the Midwest early this morning.  And while the quake centered on Illinois, tremors were felt as far as way as Indianapolis and  Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
[01:18:00]  Uh, people from the Midwest don't usually get earthquakes, so you can bet they weren't prepared,  and a lot of them hopefully got crushed under their houses.  And, uh, let's do some weather now.  Okay.  Uh, Atlanta, cloudy.  Chicago, cloudy.  Detroit, cloudy.  Dallas, cloudy.  And I got a good weather-related story.  You're really gonna get a kick out of this one.  There's a big tragedy in Colorado.  What happened? 
[01:18:30]  They got out of control wildflowers.  Fires.  Out of control wildflowers?  No, fires, I meant to say.  I like wildflowers myself.  Hundreds of people got evacuated.  Yeah.  And residents are surveying the smoldering ruins of their homes.  They say it's a real heartbreaker.  And that's been Club Soda Kenny with the open, Anthony, traffic, and weather on the 8th.  Thank you. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  It was, uh, at 744, but who's, uh, keeping track?  Let's say hi to Brian in Pennsylvania.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, here's the, uh, first three for your Mad Libs.  All right.  We gave the answers, but you, uh, what were your answers?  Uh, goiters, support hose, and tongue scrapers.  Hmm.  So it would be goiters, more goiters than you could poke a support hose at as Tanya is  forced to wash Linna's tongue scrapers. 
[01:19:30]  That doesn't work.  You suck at Mad Libs.  I hated people that sucked at Mad Libs.  It had potential, Brian.  More goiters and support hose than you can shake a tongue scraper at.  It did use to teach you things, though.  Yeah, sure.  Remember in Mad Libs, it would teach you, like, okay, uh, we need a noun.  Like, what's, what's that?  Person, place, or thing.  Person, place, or thing.  We need a verb. 
[01:20:00]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, we need an adjective.  And you sit there and go, I don't, I don't know what those are.  Need an adverb was like, oh, my God, I forgot what an adverb was.  So then you have to read the sentence and try to figure out what an adverb was.  What's an adverb?  Hey, uh, we're watching, uh, the latest Grand Theft Auto, uh, video game on the big screen  behind it.  Yes.  Uh, right off the bat, it looks so much better than the last game.  And the last game looked pretty damn cool.  Yeah, Grand Theft Auto has always been, graphically, a great game. 
[01:20:30]  Uh, this one really takes it to the limit.  They really upped, uh, up their game, huh, there, Laszlo?  Yeah.  It's been, it's been like three and a half years of 12-hour days.  This is three and a half years in the making?  Yeah.  It's been that long since the last one?  Well, even after, uh, San, after we finished San Andreas, we pretty much started right,  right on GTA 4.  Like, I just hijacked a helicopter.  The, um, the thing that's nice is, you know, we really pushed the, the PS2 to the limit. 
[01:21:00]  And with the, um, with all the space and the processing power that you have for the, uh,  the Xbox 360 and the PS3, um, our goal was to make a fully realized world that feels lived  in, so, um, GTA 4 is set in a spoof of New York City, uh, you have boroughs, you have  toll booths, you have tunnels, you have crazy street preachers that get up in your face and  scream at you when you're walking down the street.  Um, when you go to Chinatown and you bump into somebody, they curse you out in Chinese. 
[01:21:30]  Um, we recorded hundreds and hundreds of people, almost over a thousand people for the game.  Can you go into buildings at all?  Yes.  That is an amazing, uh, it's New York City.  Yeah, it looks really...  It's pretty much New York City.  We're, we're...  A spoof of New York City.  Exactly.  Yeah, he hijacked a helicopter and he's above New York City.  And the detail looks amazing.  All the bridges are there.  There's a big Empire State Building thing.  The Get-A-Life Building.  The Get-A-Life Building.  Can you fly by the, uh, the top of the Empire State Building? 
[01:22:00]  Absolutely.  You can go on top of the Empire State Building.  You can take the elevator to the top and use, uh, you know, those binocular things that  they have up there.  Yeah.  Or you can have a sniper rifle.  Whatever you want to do.  I can take a peek around our, like, the Chrysler Building.  All the bridges are there.  Wow.  That's pretty, pretty cool.  Yes.  You can?  One of the things that we also did in this, and, uh, Anthony saw this when he stopped  by Rockstar Games a couple times.  Just jumped out of the helicopter.  Oh, that's a long ball, man. 
[01:22:30]  We used, uh, we used new physics engines for this.  So every character in the game that you walk up to on the street or you yourself has an assigned  skeleton and even a nervous system.  So when you go up in the game and you push somebody over, it's not going to be just a  stock animation of them falling over.  They fall down differently every time.  Really?  Just as a human being would.  And when you saw Nico jumping out of a helicopter for some reason, um, he decided to bail out.  But his body tumbles like a real body would, would tumble. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, you get that rag doll look.  Right.  It's not, uh, any kind of pre-done animation.  It's all, it's all done on the fly.  So, which is one of the reasons that we, we delayed the game by six months is we, we wanted  to put in those little touches to make it, to make it perfect.  Dude, it looks so good.  The details look great.  The, uh, the grit on the street.  And also the pedestrians, you know, the, the people of, of the, the cities that we spoof  in Grand Theft Auto have always been a huge part, the comments that they make.  Now there's literally 10 to 20 pages of dialogue per person walking the street. 
[01:23:30]  So if you're walking, if you're running around like a jackass, like he is right now, stealing  a truck, um, if he goes around the corner and, and hides, there will be the, the people  in the streets will point as the cops go by and say, he's over there.  Oh, those bastard rats.  If he climbs up a building, they'll point up at him and say, he's up there.  So it's that level.  It's that level of, uh, the other thing that, that we did that's a lot of fun is, um, you  know, mobile phones are so ubiquitous in, in, uh, in society now. 
[01:24:00]  And so, and when you walk the streets of New York, everybody's on their phone, nobody's  looking at each other.  So the, uh, the peds have phone conversations in this game.  So they'll be walking in some of them.  We spoofed the, the whole next tell two way thing as well.  Oh, really?  Right.  So you're, you're hearing both sides of the conversation.  Cause that's one of the things that has always kind of annoyed me.  So driving up the stairs, running over people.  That's great.  This is so great.  What is that little circle in the corner?  Uh, that's your, that's the map. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that's the map.  And it also, uh, when it's flashing like that, it, it shows that you're, um, that you're  wanted.  Yeah.  Uh, I, I, I went out and got PlayStation three just for this game, just for this game.  I can't wait.  Dude, it looks so good on a, on a flat screen.  Yeah, absolutely.  Well, uh, Laszlo.  Yeah.  And of course, you know, ever since, uh, what was it?  I think GTA four was there actually GTA San Andreas was the, um, first game that you guys  were in.  Right.  Um, Anthony. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  We're all in this, uh, we're all in this game and he's got, uh, very happy.  He's got a, the description of all our characters here.  Laszlo, Laszlo, Laszlo put my audio.  Yeah.  Put Anne in the game, myself in the game, Jim Norton in the game, uh, our own fan, Danny  and, uh, and Steve Martini, Steve, Steve, the bear has made the cut and, uh, Bob Kelly.  Those are the guys from this radio show, you know, and love that are in, uh, the new  Grand Theft, uh, and I'm pretty sure you can chase down Bob Kelly and kill him. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, what a treat.  What do you hop on a glacier and it catches him?  Here's the description of, uh, us in the, in the game.  Anthony, for example, is a 40 year old.  Oh, 44.  No, 40 right on the nose.  40 year old.  Oh, and he's showing us the screen caps of our characters from Grand Theft Auto 4.  Uh, Anthony, a 40 year old mobster whose career is worried about getting sent down because  he killed too many people.  Hmm.  Very nice.  And here's a picture of Anthony in, in the strip club, his character hanging out. 
[01:26:00]  Of course.  Yes.  Nice.  Can we put these screen caps on onaradio.com?  Uh, yeah, I'll try to, I'll get them to you.  Like today?  I don't know about today.  Well, today, you gotta understand, you're the first, uh, sort of outside, uh, media in  America, or actually the world that's, uh.  Give us a couple screen caps.  We get national attention today, Laszlo.  Laszlo has the power to do that.  Yeah, I could, well, maybe.  Just give us a couple.  Nice.  I'll try to push it through.  Are you high up at Rockstar?  He's, he's pretty up there.  Um, his name's Laszlo Rockstar, dude. 
[01:26:30]  Oh.  You didn't know his last name?  Yeah.  No, I thought that was Rookstar.  You gotta throw his a bone.  A couple screen caps, it's, it's, it's an international sensation for a couple days.  Yeah, maybe I'll hook you up with this one.  It's, uh, it's also Anthony at the strip club, but he's pulled a knife on security.  Nice.  Ah, yeah, there we go.  I like that.  Why would Anthony have a knife when he could have a gun, though?  I'm probably gonna have my license for, uh, uh, Liberty City.  Wow.  How many buildings can you go in?  That's great.  That I don't know, but, but it's a lot.  And there's also, you know, one of the things that we did to make, uh, this a lot more of 
[01:27:00]  a real living, breathing experience was you, you have a mobile phone as you meet people  in the game, they call you.  Do you want to go hang out?  Um, if, uh, if Sean, the, uh, the player there will go check out the bar, uh, if you  go to the bar with one of your buddies, um, you'll actually get drunk and then drive very  poorly.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Danny.  Oh, the media's gonna be all over you guys this time around once again. 
[01:27:30]  Well, that's one of the things that, uh, anything that you do in Grand Theft Auto, those repercussions.  If you run around like an ass, the cops are gonna come arrest you.  Right.  You know, if you go drink and are driving like a retard, the cops are gonna pull you over  and throw you in jail.  Am I reading this correctly that the name of this trip club is Honkers?  Yeah.  Honkers.  I love it.  So now, I, I know you're able to just, like, if a cop is behind you and you're driving  stupid and, uh, you know, blowing through lights and hitting stuff, the cop really wouldn't 
[01:28:00]  do anything unless you did something to him or killed some people.  Will he get on your ass if you're being an idiot?  If, if you hit somebody in front of him, yes.  Um, if you're just blowing a light and stuff, no.  Yeah, that's kind of rough, yeah.  What we found was that, you know, you'd have the cops after you all the time.  Yeah, because you gotta blow through lights, you need to do missions and stuff.  Hey, uh, Try Lucky Strike, uh, writes, ask Laszlo if GTA 4 lets you knock out an old  lady with an ugly hat.  Is that in the game? 
[01:28:30]  I don't know if there's any old ladies with ugly hats.  Uh, Ricky Gervais is in the game, though, right?  Yes, Ricky Gervais is, um.  A lot of celebrities?  Um, you know, not as many as, as, uh, as San Andreas in that, um, we sort of tone that  down.  There's a, there's a few on the radio that are pretty cool, um, and working with Ricky  was, was amazing.  He was actually very impressed with this show.  Really?  Yeah.  Especially Ron Bennington.  He had, he had nice things to say about Ron.  You remember Ronnie came in and, uh, wanted to meet him, so he just sat down and pretty 
[01:29:00]  much hijacked the interview.  Hijacked the interview.  Which was, uh, fine by us.  Hey, how big is this world, uh, GTA 4, uh, compared to, like, GTA 3?  Wow.  Well, you know, San Andreas was vast in that it sort of spoofed three cities.  It spoofed San Francisco, Las Vegas, and L.A., uh, and there was huge sort of like countryside.  It took forever to drive from, from one side to the other.  This will take you a long time to drive from one side to the other, but since there's so  much intense detail, um, in it with, you know, toll booths and tunnels and bridges and so 
[01:29:30]  forth, um, it, it is an enormous city.  And we have all the boroughs, of course, except for Staten Island, because Staten Island's  The look is way...  What are you going to get?  The mall.  Laszlo, the look is way updated.  I mean, look at the, look at the shadows and the lighting.  It's just amazing.  It really is amazing.  And if he's, if you say...  Hit that, hit that bitch with the coffee cup.  Just smack her in the head.  Um.  Oh, he's ready to duke it out. 
[01:30:00]  He's ready to punch her in the...  Just kick her or something.  Oh, my God.  Um.  Ah!  He's popped her in the head.  She goes down.  Knocked her down.  Ah, just keep punching her.  If you stand in one place, like right there, you see those shadows.  As the sun goes over in the game, the shadows will pass underneath you.  There's also, um, we did a, you know, the radio was huge, um, starting in GTA 3.  This has an in-game internet with over a hundred websites that we wrote. 
[01:30:30]  That was a ton of writing.  Wait, so what does that mean?  But we, uh, you go to an internet cafe to check your email in the game.  Okay.  You'll get email from characters.  You'll be sent on missions.  Your girlfriend, when you start making girlfriends, they start sending you annoying emails.  You get spam.  Um.  It's like regular life.  And there's blogs in the game.  You can go read blogs.  So as the game progresses, if there's a blog that you like, when you go back and check it  out, it'll be updated.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  Are you connected to the web at all with this, or no?  This is all contained in the game. 
[01:31:00]  This is all contained in the game.  There is a multiplayer, uh, component of it, which, uh, people, we just sort of revealed  a week or so ago.  Yeah.  People have been raving about that.  Very excited about that one.  I was telling Anthony, one of the multiplayer modes, you can, uh, you know, everybody's playing  at home, but there's four of you in a car.  Anthony's driving.  I mean, you guys are in the back seat and, um, you know, Kenny's in a helicopter above and  you're, you're trying to race to get out of town while you've got a bunch of other  players that are trying to stop you.  And you can, each individual player can hang out the window and target their own gun. 
[01:31:30]  It's very cool.  Yeah.  It's absolutely cooperative play.  Yeah.  Are you drunk yet?  No, he's just wandering around.  Yeah.  Go get drunk.  Yeah.  We're going to get the guy drunk and then see how that plays out.  Oh, this is a good mission.  What is this now?  With the cranes?  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  He's up on top of an AK.  The, um.  On a crane.  And the, the weapons that they modeled for this are extremely realistic as well as the  physics. 
[01:32:00]  Um, I think you should play a, uh.  Yeah.  We're going to play that after the break.  What I'm trying to get through here is, um, uh, you used a bunch of guys from this radio  show for, uh, for the game.  Like we said, Anthony's a 40 year old mobster.  Uh, somehow you got me to play an Irish American thug and I can't, I, I don't do accents.  So I don't do the brogue.  So I don't know how you pull this one off.  I was just using my regular voice, but my character's description is Irish American thug  24 wants to be a hard man.  Worried. 
[01:32:30]  No one takes him seriously.  F you, Leslo.  Out of his depth.  Once, uh, people start getting really tough and nasty.  That's, uh, my character.  Moving on to Dan's character.  He plays a doctor.  Yes.  Oh.  Three year old senior doctor.  Uh, that's supposed to be the 30 something year old.  Okay.  Uh, 30 something year old senior doctor consultant, white, well-educated, blames all health problems  on people's lifestyles and therefore blames them for getting ill.  Very matter of fact.  Yeah.  When I saw the very matter of fact, I was like, I'm going to have to cast Nathaniel. 
[01:33:00]  We need somebody that's just sort of monotone and bizarre.  Right.  Like, oh, yeah.  Wow.  He just got snipered.  Oh, holy crap.  Explain what happened.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Uh, he just took out a, uh, a guy on a crane.  Guy on a crane.  The guy falls and hits the roof of a car.  Of an SUV.  And just splatters.  The falling is, looks way more realistic than, uh, GTA 3A falling.  That's great.  I don't remember ever seeing people falling this far. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, here goes another guy sniped.  Oh, yeah.  Just laid him out.  Uh, moving on.  Our own Danny made the game as a male, white, 27, extremely depressed hipster, worried about  terrorism and how awful the Chinese slash rest of the world are.  And I have to say, nobody was, is worried about their performance as Danny.  Danny's very worried about his performance.  A lot of the stuff that you're yelling is, he's got a gun, or, hey, watch where you're  going.  Or if you're stuck in traffic, you know, that character will yell, like, hey, let's move 
[01:34:00]  it, stupid.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  Danny, afterwards, he's like, was I good?  Did I, uh, I wasn't sure of my motivation on this one.  When I went to do the voiceover, I was right in the middle of the worst sinus infection  on the face of the earth.  So I sound, I probably sound like, in game, so nasally and awful.  And I was actually worried it was going to get cut because it was so bad.  We're going to find out after the, after the break, we're going to play some audio clips  from, uh, Grand Theft Auto 4 and some of our outtakes, uh, there, Lazlo. 
[01:34:30]  Absolutely.  All right, uh, moving on, Steve, uh, good old Steve, the executive producer of the Opie  and Anthony show.  Uh, he's a fat, middle-aged cop, John Goodman type, loves burgers.  And men.  Yes, wait till you hear some of his outtakes.  Really?  Oh, God.  I had, see, I had people go, I had people, I had, uh, one of the editors go through all  your sessions and, and mark anything that sort of stood out.  Yeah.  And in Pro Tools, he marked the markers, another weird gay comment. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, this is a guy that doesn't even know Steve.  Oh, wow.  This guy doesn't even know Steve.  Oh, Steve.  Oh, very nice.  And then you got, uh, Jim Noren plays a porn shop worker.  Yes.  Made the game.  What does cut scene in game mean?  That's, that's, that's pretty, that's pretty cool.  That means that when people go to launch a mission, that your, your character is not  just a, like, for instance, Steve, Steve's character is just one of many of hundreds walking  the streets.  Right.  Yours, uh, actually interacts with the main player in a cut scene and sends him out 
[01:35:30]  on a mission.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  It cut scenes are like what you kind of, you just kind of watch.  You don't really do anything.  You just kind of watch as the game, I guess, uh, loads up to the next, uh, part of, uh,  of, uh, the game.  Wait, as a non-video guy, how long would it take to go through this whole game?  Um, well, it's between 80 and 100 hours if you wanted to complete everything.  Just to play the game?  Just to, to, to do all the side missions?  See, the beauty with Grand Theft Auto is, like, you, to play the game, like he said,  would take 80 to 100 hours, but then you could spend hundreds of hours just messing 
[01:36:00]  around in-game doing stuff.  Never playing the game.  You could just shoot people.  You could just walk around, beat people over the head with things.  Oh, you could?  Yeah, you don't have to just follow the world.  It's a fully realized open world.  Uh, a buddy of mine who is, loves San Andreas, stopped playing the missions and just started  going to the horse track every time he fired the game up.  Same thing here, you know, you can go play darts, you can go, uh, strip clubs.  Strip clubs.  Yeah.  Yeah, you should go to the strip club soon.  That's a, I'm going to see honkers.  You want to talk about some really good graphics.  All right, I want to, I want to see how, uh, you guys updated the strip club. 
[01:36:30]  Take us to honkers.  Yeah.  Yeah, we want to go to honkers.  And then finally, Bob Kelly is a mob guy in Grand Theft Auto 4.  So this is what we're going to do.  Lazlo's here.  We got the game up on the huge screen.  It looks unbelievable.  Really?  Uh, should have put Voss in it.  That would have been a good one.  That would have been great.  Hey, fuck.  Yeah, his acting style.  I don't know if I can actually direct him to...  Do you guys have a comedy club in this?  That would have been fun.  That would be fun.  With some hack comedians just doing their thing and you get to kill them. 
[01:37:00]  I did want to do that.  In fact, when we originally were going through the concepts for this three years ago, um,  I spoke with Bill Burr and I said, you know, we would really love to have some kind of  really horrible comedy.  Guys, it goes over there.  It's like, you know, does the airline peanuts jokes.  Yeah.  What are the differences between men and women, huh?  Right, guys?  You know?  Just hacky stuff.  Stand up and beat them over the head with a crowbar or something.  All right.  Uh, when we get back, we got some audio clips from Grand Theft Auto 4. 
[01:37:30]  Very cool.  Coming out April 29th, so a week from Tuesday.  And Anthony Sings...  Beans!  Louie Beans!  That would have been a great one.  Just Voss walking around like a dope.  And Anthony...  That he is like life.  After the break, Anthony Sings for Grand Theft Auto 4.  Oh!  Oh, I also brought you, uh, for when the Pope is, uh, the motorcade goes through, I got  a big foam hand.  Yes, it's a GTA, uh, four hand.  But it's, um, it's in the shape of the shocker.  Yes, the shocker.  I see that.  If you, uh, if you, uh, if you know the shocker, I believe it's two and one and one and the 
[01:38:00]  other.  Yeah.  And there's a nice rhyme that goes with it.  Yeah.  The shocker.  I see you brought product.  Very, very, uh, happy.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, Laszlo in studio today.  We're hanging with Laszlo today on the Opie and Anthony show.  He brought in Grand Theft Auto 4.  Getting an exclusive little, uh, first peek at this.  Are we one of the first?  First radio station in America.  Yeah, nobody's, uh, even seen this yet.  Hey, uh, Jimmy is just losing his mind.  I never played video games since Asteroids. 
[01:38:30]  And I'm watching.  Oh my God.  I really haven't.  And I'm watching this, this world.  And I'm like, I definitely, I cannot.  Whoa.  What?  What?  He's in a strip club.  Uh, a stripper just walked up and asked Nico if he wanted a private dance.  She got a nice ass on her.  Hey, you got the Russian stripper.  Look at that.  You got the, this has come a long way.  Yeah, we're in the middle of the strip club right now. 
[01:39:00]  And Nico's sitting on the couch, getting a lap dance.  You guys have definitely upgraded the graphics.  Switch camera angles.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  She's doing the bend over in front of him move.  And you could switch.  No touching.  You could switch the camera angle.  Can you zoom in?  Do they get?  No, there's no zooming in.  Do they get totally nude?  No, there's no, there's no, there's no, because you know that people freak out about that.  Somehow it's okay to turn somebody's head into a red mist in a game like Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto 4. 
[01:39:30]  But if they're naked, yeah, then there's a problem.  Then there's a problem.  Violence is awesome, but sex is bad.  Once again, the graphics just definitely upgraded from the last game.  By the way, we'll get the secret code to take their clothes off?  There is no secret code to take their clothes off.  Of course there is.  Somebody will probably go in and hack that, and then we'll get blamed for it.  They'll hack it.  You'll get blamed for it.  As usual.  How many times did you guys hear, okay, there's no codes, right?  They can't get the clothes off these girls.  What?  Another dance?  Yeah, of course. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, yeah, another dance.  Hey, Anthony, we got some audio.  Can he shoot her?  I'm sorry.  Can he shoot her?  Jesus.  She's got her breasts in his face, and Norton wants to blow her head off.  Can he shoot her?  Will you shoot her?  Will you shoot her?  Oh, that's not.  Yeah, stop it.  Just shoot her, because she's being irritated.  How is she being irritated?  He's stopping the dance.  Oh, no.  He gets up off the couch.  He's thinking about it. 
[01:40:30]  Where's your gun?  Oh, boy.  She's walking out of the room.  He's not happy.  She's leaving.  Oh, boy.  He's picking his weapon.  He's got a micro-Uzi.  Oh, good.  Oh, gee.  Why would you want to do that?  Oh, there goes security.  One dead stripper for you, Jim.  Oh, no.  Now security's just taking a beating.  And now he's getting out of the strip club.  If you act up at all, it's like a real strip club.  The security will come and pummel you.  Yeah, of course.  Could you just walk down the street there, though? 
[01:41:00]  You can walk down any street you want?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a completely open world.  I'm finished if I get this game.  I'm finished.  Like I said, we recorded for the Russian section of town.  We recorded a ton of Russians.  They speak a little English and some Russian.  We had translators in all the recording sessions.  We recorded tons of languages to really bring the city to life.  That's awesome.  Let's get into the audio clubs, because we've got a lot of them.  And Laszlo was nice enough to get a bunch of us into GTA 4, and he brought in some audio samples. 
[01:41:30]  Correct.  Us messing up our lines, some of the legit lines, right?  A little of everything there, Laszlo.  Correct.  Some interesting stuff?  All right.  Take it away here.  Well, you're first, you know, Opie's not always as angry as he sounds.  When he came into the session, he was sort of having a Steve C moment at the beginning,  where everything was kind of monotone.  Thanks.  I'm not inspired.  So basically, what you want to say is, here's Opie doing some bad acting.  Right. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  Thanks, Laszlo.  I give up.  Please stop.  I give up.  Please stop.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That was awful.  It wasn't?  Yeah, it was.  But he got into it.  Here's a clip of if you go up to Opie's character in the game and punch him.  You're about to get pwned.  I'm a buss.  So what will happen is, if you go up to Opie's character and punch him, his fists will go  up and he'll start going after you and he'll taunt you with the, there's tons of taunts. 
[01:42:30]  With poisms.  Each, uh...  I'll let it be known.  I went off script a little bit.  Yes.  My character, you know, I was feeling pretty good.  Oh.  Also, uh, since, uh, Opie's kind of an Irish, uh, gang member, thug guy.  Yeah, because you can hear it in the voice.  Hey, um, you can, well, but you're not, you're Irish American.  Not every Irish American sounds like a leprechaun.  Hey, come on.  Put up your dukes.  I lived in Boston long enough.  Everybody, uh, that lives in Saudi, even though they're not from Ireland originally, they, they  have a little of the Irish in them when they speak. 
[01:43:00]  Um, he was just, uh, showing some other gameplay.  You can also hail cabs.  You don't have to steal cars.  You can, if you put your hand up, the nearest cab will drive over to you.  Oh, really?  And then you can just sit and enjoy the ride.  The thing is that, uh, and the cabbies will sit and talk to you or they'll sit there and  babble back to Pakistan and their crazy language on their phone like they do here in New York.  Absolutely.  The other thing that they did is, I don't know if you remember in previous GTAs when you'd fail  a mission and you'd have to redo it, all the dialogue would repeat. 
[01:43:30]  Right.  We recorded multiple dialogue sequences for each, for each mission.  So when you fail a mission and you're chatting with one of the characters on the way to the  warehouse, you have to go do a shootout.  Yeah, it's not the same lines.  It's not the same lines.  It's different conversations.  Yeah.  It gets me honest after a while.  Yeah, it's those little touches to really sort of bring it to life.  But also, Opie's character smokes in the game.  Nice.  So you'll hit, uh, track three.  Can you believe Greg and Tony got kicked off the air?  So you'll see characters in the game chatting, smoking cigarettes, and just throwing out 
[01:44:00]  lines like that.  Greg and Tony.  O and A show references that no one's going to get except fans of the show.  Uh, also another line of Opie while smoking.  Dude, I think that bitch gave me crabs.  Good.  Good.  Wonderful acting.  Yes.  All right.  Just a weird inflection to put on.  Can you play that one again?  I know, Jimmy.  I guess I'll be doing radio for another 20 years.  Great.  This is wonderful.  Just in case I was thinking maybe I could get out of this hellhole soon.  Dude, I think that bitch gave me crabs.  Crabs! 
[01:44:30]  Gave me crabs!  Let's see, but Anthony, he had some issues too.  Sometimes, uh, while he was doing his, uh, kind of Italian, uh, mobster guy, uh, every  now and then he'd sort of start sounding like Andrew Dice Clay.  Yeah, yeah.  He sort of slipped into a dice!  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  So, but...  I got a court date with my bitch ex-wife!  That's if, if, uh, Anthony's in a car behind you and, uh, your car's not moving, he'll  lean out the window and, and scream, uh, various comments. 
[01:45:00]  Also...  Because that's what I do anyway.  If you, if you come into the Italian section of, uh, if the main player comes into the Italian  section of town and is causing trouble, Anthony will tell you to get off his turf.  Clear out of here before I make you!  Huh?  Huh?  I'm angry.  You are angry.  I'm angry.  Also, another thing we did is, you notice that with the graphics and everything, people  respond to the, the stuff that you do.  If you shoot somebody in the leg, they'll go, ow, you shot me in the leg, or ow, my leg. 
[01:45:30]  So it's, I mean, that sort of level of detail.  But also, you, you can shoot Anthony in the leg.  Ah, you broke my knee, dude!  I have so many inside jokes with this.  There are a ton of them.  Actually, I didn't bring any character, any of Sam's, uh, in Sam's dialogue, but he's  down in the Wall Street district, like an internet nerd guy.  And I was playing the other day, and I'm, I'm walking by, and this guy, the phone rings  by one of the, one of the, one of the peds on the street, and it's Sam's voice, and he's  like, yeah?  That's terrible, I'm sorry. 
[01:46:00]  I was cracking up.  That's so funny.  And I took you a picture of, uh, you know, Jim is the, uh, porn shop worker.  Yeah, we got some screen caps.  You gotta give that, uh, to us today there, uh, Lesla.  We will hook you up.  International, uh, attention, you give us, uh, those.  Uh, but Jimmy's, what, he plays, uh, a worker in a porn shop?  Yeah, and you go in, and, uh, as the, as the main player, you, you go in and, and deal  with him, and he's, in this clip, he's arguing.  He's arguing with you over his protection money.  I love the inflection at the end. 
[01:46:30]  It's, it's pure acting.  We ain't making that much cash.  Your cousins back in Eastern Europe do this to practically nothing.  Undercutting us!  I love that.  Look at that.  Undercutting us!  I applaud you, Jimmy.  That's great.  And then another line from Jimmy?  Yes.  He's, I, I believe he's commenting on shrubbery at this point.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  You see?  They don't make them like that no more. 
[01:47:00]  That's a vintage bush.  Commenting on shrubs.  Yes.  Um, but, you know, one of the highlights of, of the game, besides Anthony coming in and  singing, um, is, uh, is, uh, is Steve.  Steve?  Yes.  Steve's session was just, I, there was so many clips.  I, I narrowed it down to eight here, I believe.  You could have given us a lot more.  I could have, dude.  I, the guy that marked up the session, it, it, it, it looked, and there was like 50 markers 
[01:47:30]  of flubs, of, of, like, comments, like, what is this, what, what is this weird man saying?  Hey, Lazlo, by the way, thanks to you, we got people listening all over the world, because  they knew you were coming in with Grand Theft Auto today, Auto 4.  Uh, Bill T. from Portugal, no joke, uh, he wants me to ask you about hot coffee.  What's, what's that about?  Oh, well, that was the, we referred earlier to, uh, people that, um, that hacked in and  modified the game.  They took some, like, residual leftover code and broke into San Andreas, and, um, then posted, 
[01:48:00]  posted executable programs on the internet to rewrite your game code to, uh, to, to show  your, your player in some kind of faux sex, uh, scene.  Yeah.  And, um, and Rockstar took, took the, the hit on that.  Yeah, I got blamed for it.  Right.  Even though this person violated the terms of agreement, you know, when you buy the game  and open the box, you know, you're not supposed to go in and modify it.  Mm-hmm.  Um, so, and, you know, we got. 
[01:48:30]  How the hell did someone figure out?  We got, dude, it took, it took somebody at Rockstar three days to figure out, to, to go  in and rewrite that code to make it happen.  And we, and Rockstar got dragged in front of the Federal Trade Commission over the whole thing.  I mean, it, it was.  So now you can't do that with this game, I'm assuming?  Oh, no.  There's nothing like that in, in, in this game.  No.  Any sort of, you know, but I'm, I'm, I'm sure somebody's going to modify something because,  but the thing is, is, um, with it on, you know, PS3 and Xbox, it's very difficult to  sort of go in and mod.  It's the PC mods that are quite, once you release a game on, on a, on a computer, it's, it's really 
[01:49:00]  easy for those guys to go in and hack about with it.  Yeah.  They can still do it on the console, but it's a lot harder, especially with, like, Blu-ray  on the, the PS3.  Mm-hmm.  Not a lot of people have Blu-ray equipment.  Yeah.  You know.  Start rewriting stuff.  Right.  Exactly.  So, um.  All right.  Moving on with Steve.  How smart are these guys?  Jesus.  Huh?  How smart are they?  It's ridiculous.  Very.  Just play the game.  I want to empty my cash.  I love how Jimmy's. 
[01:49:30]  I love how you can't empty your cash.  Are you worried that your chick's gonna.  I love how Jimmy is yelling, how smart are these guys with egg, egg in his mouth.  Yeah, egg's falling out of his face.  Mouth full of food.  How smart are these guys?  I mean, nothing.  They're going to hack games.  It's, it's insane.  People do want to know when the, uh, PC platform is coming out.  I don't know.  I haven't seen it release date.  To be honest, just the, the five, uh, Rockstar studios that have been cranking nonstop to  get, uh, the Xbox 360 and PS3 version has, has been a lot. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Um, Xbox.  Let's get, let's get into some of the Steve audio here.  Oh, so here's, uh, here's what it looks like when you're driving drunk.  Oh, really?  He had a few drinks?  I thought it was a little bit more wavy than that.  Oh, he's, yeah, you can tell he's a little, he's a little hazy.  Oh, you're sobering up?  Well, go get drunker.  He's a little hazy.  Yeah, I mean, like the screen really wobbles when you first come out, when you first  come out of the bar.  Oh, you can tell he's having a hard time.  Also, the controls change. 
[01:50:30]  It's really hard to control the car.  That's great.  So get on a bridge.  That's a good idea.  That's a great idea, though, man.  You guys made a lot of, uh, changes.  That's Steve from Bayshore.  Oh, so we get to see the world the way Anthony does.  You smartass.  Oh, sorry.  We all weren't supposed to laugh that way.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, so here's Steve.  Um, Steve is, uh, one of many policemen, uh, in the game.  And, uh, if you, the player, are doing something bad, he'll tell you to stop.  Hey, I'm a damn expert.  Stop, will ya?  Hmm? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Also, Steve telling, uh, his fellow cops to split up and search for the player.  Okay, let's split up.  We'll get him.  Now, can you hear the enthusiasm in the we'll get him?  Of course you can.  Yeah.  We'll get him.  We'll get him.  Here's Steve if, uh, if he arrests you.  Now you're in trouble.  Huh?  Now you're in trouble.  You're in trouble.  Um, also you can, you can, uh, if you see Steve, uh, driving in his police car, you  can go up and, and, uh, steal it.  No one jacks me. 
[01:51:30]  Which, I love that, uh, double entendre.  Yes.  Exactly.  Everyone jacks me.  What's the next one?  Uh, Steve flirting with, uh, with a girl.  Oh.  Oh.  Is heaven missing an angel?  So, during the session, he would just burst in, like, he would see the lines in front  of him, and he would just burst into the, the bizarre gay voice.  It's my prith. 
[01:52:00]  Eat my fat, hairy fist.  Who was that ass?  Ah.  Almost.  Almost.  Um, yeah, the, the, but, I will have to say, Steve does, he does deliver.  Once you, once you get him wound up.  Actually, uh, when he's doing sort of the monotone, boring reads, you just go in and start, uh,  asking him about, you know, how are things going with censorship on the CBS side and things 
[01:52:30]  like that, and he goes into a rage and delivers his lines perfectly.  Yeah, that would have been boring today, though.  You gotta get, uh, when we're messing up.  Now, we, uh, finally, we got to Anthony's, uh, jingle.  Oh.  You know, if, one of the things that I, I love in the way we spoof, uh, radio and, um, all  the outdoor in the game, there's billboards throughout the game that we wrote and designed  logos for, and, um, there, there's over a hundred radio commercials, um, in the game, 
[01:53:00]  and, and one of them, I always love those Budweiser commercials that have people singing.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, cause it's always about, like, you work hard, you're an American, get drunk,  you know, and it's just sort of, like, real, um, Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah, that gritty kind of blue-collar.  Blue-collar.  So, Dan Hauser and I, uh, who write all the comedy and the games, um, got together, and,  and I, I found a piece of music, and, and we scored some lyrics to it, and Anthony was  in recording his, uh, Italian, uh, mob boss guy. 
[01:53:30]  And, uh, I said, would you be interested in doing some singing?  And watching Anthony sing in front of a microphone, I really wish I would have taken pictures.  It was such a we are the world moment.  He was, he was, he was on his tippy toes at times, and he was, this big, beautiful $5,000  Neumann microphone, just making love to it.  Because I really wanted to, my performance to come out.  Just reaching up toward the microphone, as you said.  Yes, so we have, um, there's a, there's a bunch of spoof brands in the game, and one  of the, one of the beer, uh, brands, in fact, I brought, I brought, they were so impressed 
[01:54:00]  with Anthony singing, they made merchandise.  Really?  Yes.  It's, um, the, uh, Pistwasser is the name of the, uh, of the beer.  It's like a German, uh, lager, but they, they made beer, uh, beer glasses.  Wow.  That's pretty cool.  They're actually, they're actually brewing beer in, in, uh, in cans and bottles.  This is amazing, you know, Steve from Bayshore is gonna love this one.  Yeah, that's very good.  Actually, I brought you a whole set for your, uh, bachelor pads. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, wow, that is absolutely gonna, uh, be a prized possession.  I will be drinking beer out of this on Pal Talk tonight.  When you, you know, when you have some of your chicks over.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll give them one of these glasses.  Or maybe just a sippy cup.  Here's some juice in a tumbler.  You want to play the jingle, then, uh, Lodzlo?  Yes, so this is, uh.  All right.  This is the Pistwasser commercial.  Last night, I think I s***ed the bed. 
[01:55:00]  Got so drunk, I gave a dude s***.  Life is just a merciful blur.  When you pop a Pistwasser.  Pistwasser, don't drink it slow.  3 a.m., buy some flow.  Sleep in the bathroom on the floor.  What really matters anymore?  All the crap you do all day.  Who s***ing cares?  Anyway. 
[01:55:30]  Pistwasser, this is beer.  Crap drunk, offer beer.  Pistwasser, drink all day.  It helps your troubles all the way.  Pistwasser, cheap German lager for export only.  That is awesome.  Yeah.  It's really, really cool.  I mean, it was a full studio performance.  We had engineers and people, microphones and levels and things. 
[01:56:00]  It was great.  Well, Lodzlo, obviously the excitement level is way up for this.  Oh, everyone's been chomping at the bit waiting for this game to come out.  I've played every single one of these games on the PSP, everything.  And I cannot believe how much you guys have upgraded on this newer version.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, I've been keeping tabs.  Lodzlo sends me links to the website.  Yeah, to see the new trailers and stuff for it.  And everybody's going to be having a blast playing this, man.  I think we did more content for the website than we put in all of GTA 3. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, I think so.  It's like every week we're putting new spoof commercials and spoof website components.  There's a law firm in the game.  We did a whole website for the law firm where you can chat with a legal assistant.  There's so many little details is what I really love about it.  Go to rockstargames.com and go to the GTA 4 section.  You can check out character clips and a bunch of the other spoof stuff that we did. 
[01:57:00]  Will people really get involved with this?  People will do their blogs and stuff like that and read them?  Oh, yeah.  I hope so.  I mean, when we were writing the in-game internet, writing an internet takes a long time, I have to say.  Yeah, right?  It's like every day.  But it's so much fun to spoof blogs and all the celebrity worship that goes on.  I mean, every website is a spoof.  There's ringtone websites.  There's different news websites.  So as you play the game, you can go to the internet cafe and read news stories about stuff you did, 
[01:57:30]  like a warehouse that you blew up in the Brooklyn section of the game.  And there's multiple, just like in New York, there's liberal and conservative news sources.  So you can look and compare at how they covered the same event.  That's hysterical.  Oh, that's going to be a lot of fun.  Great detail.  Can you understand this is the beginning of a lack of socialization with human beings?  Of course.  People are just going to sit home.  Once you get a little suction thing that feels like a mouth, no one will ever go out. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, this has been going on for a while, and this Grand Theft Auto 4 is taking it to the next level.  That's for sure, Laszlo.  Hey, subways in the game?  There are subways.  And we also, you know, there's been sort of this dark blanket over New York City of this terrorism fear  and the weird color schemes.  And, you know, when you ride the Long Island Railroad, they say, you know,  any bags are subject to search by police.  And it's just, it feels very dark in New York.  We really amp that up. 
[01:58:30]  The New York spoof, Liberty City, which is where GTA 4 is set,  is a very gritty, dark kind of feel.  And sometimes in the subways, there's announcements about, you know,  police may harass you and rifle through your bags.  And we really try to amp that up.  Right now, Sean is showing you the in-game internet where there's news.  Four.  That's a spoof TV show ad. 
[01:59:00]  And just like on the web, there's annoying banners that pop up for fake stuff.  There's one for America's Next Top Hooker.  And what's his personals?  Oh, you can, oh, there's also, in Jim's honor, actually, I had us put this in,  but we did a Craigslist spoof called Craplist.  And it is, the postings on there are amazing. 
[01:59:30]  But, yeah, there's personals.  And you can actually, on the personals website, in the game,  you can hook up with chicks and go out on dates.  Can you shoot her on a date?  Yes, you can.  Of course you can.  Of course.  That's all Jimmy wants to do.  Jimmy just wants to.  Yeah.  Wait, can you do me a favor?  Is there anyone with a hat?  Could you go on a date with her?  With the trucker hat there?  Yeah.  No, you can't.  No?  Hey, Laszlo, you know, hooker is very, very, you know, important to the Grand Theft Auto games. 
[02:00:00]  Do you have any hookers with big backs in this game?  With big backs?  In honor of Jimmy.  No, I don't like training.  This is just a joke for a kid.  No, I know.  But I will say that just like in the real world, if you wanted to, you could sleep with Anthony's ex.  Oh.  Yeah.  What does she play?  She's a hooker?  Yeah.  And a stripper.  It's great.  Very nice. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, she did a good job on that.  Hey, Laszlo.  Absolutely.  Laszlo, bravo to you, my friend.  Thanks, man.  And you described it very, very well today on the show.  This game, obviously, is going to be a massive hit.  Huge.  We hope so.  Who are we kidding?  Huge.  More with Laszlo, and we're going to wrap up this side of the Opie and Anthony show in  just a bit.  But first, let's go to the FU line and see what you guys are all about today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have five new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, hi. 
[02:01:00]  This is Brian from Glen Cove.  I just want to say a big f*** you to my girlfriend for cheating on me last night.  I just want that guy to know that that bitch has herpes.  Next message.  Hey, this is a big f*** you to Fox Network for cutting to commercial during a Yankees-Red  Sox series two pitches from the end of a game.  Thanks, guys.  Next message.  Yeah, I just want to send a big FU out to my mom's f***ing uterus or ovaries, whatever  the hell else brought me here into this frickin' hell with my fat bitch wife and my f***ing 
[02:01:30]  annoying kids.  F*** you, mom's f***ing.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big f*** you to the methadone clinic for not giving me my dose  this morning because I blew a .004 in the breathalyzer.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, good morning, fellas.  I want to say a big FU to the Pope because I'm stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Hallelujah.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[02:02:00]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Oh, welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio program.  We're off.  Grand Theft Auto 4 is being premiered and will be premiered tonight through Sunday at Caroline's.  Oh, Jesus.  He's got to plug himself.  No, no.  I was just saying I'll be doing it.  Tsk.  Tsk.  What?  It slipped out.  Shepard 1 has departed from Andrews Air Force Base. 
[02:02:30]  Ew, is that what they call his plane?  The Pope?  Shepard 1.  Shepard 1 has departed from Andrews.  It is en route now to Kennedy Airport to completely, completely and totally f*** up my commute home.  Everybody leave work now if you want to get home in time for supper.  Shepard 1 coming in.  I swear, if you want to see excerpts like we've been watching here, but if you want to see some previews of Grand Theft Auto 4, watch me on my drive home today. 
[02:03:00]  Look for the Black Escalade running over people on sidewalks because I'm not going to be able to deal with the traffic.  Hey, Steven S. from Bayshore writes, hope someone really has to pester Laszlo for some screenshots.  They'll be up all weekend and we'll get a lot of views and a lot of attention for you boys.  I agree.  I will submit the request.  Oh, come on.  Come on. 
[02:03:30]  Laszlo.  Just a screen cap.  What damage could that do?  Yeah, you're right.  Here's Bob Kelly.  Well, that looks like Bob Kelly.  That's a trash.  He's standing next to a sanitation truck.  How about if we show him on Pal Talk real fast?  And then what happens is you get a screen cap, but it's not the best quality and it's still like a little safe.  I'd rather have a higher quality.  I'll get you screen grabs.  All right.  People would want to just go look at these.  Sure.  Oh, my God.  People are manic.  There are a lot of screen caps on the site. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  You know, you can see a lot of the screen caps on the site.  But they're not of the characters that you guys know.  No, of course not.  Oh, I see.  So then whatever.  Are there Grand Theft Auto fans that would love to be sitting here watching this?  Dude.  Oh, my God.  They would lose their minds.  Absolutely.  Really?  See, that looks like me driving.  Okay.  There's already people camped out outside stores to buy it.  When does this come out again?  I forgot.  Tuesday?  April 29th.  A week from Tuesday.  A week from Tuesday.  They're camped out already?  They've been camped out for over a week or two.  You know what?  But I'm going to hand out my copy.  Oh, that poor individual.  For the last loss handing over to us after the show. 
[02:04:30]  I will be out on the streets of Manhattan just allowing people to have my copy.  Sure.  To the highest bidder.  See, that's how I drive.  Right there.  I see that.  Well, oh, boy.  Well, you don't do that.  Oh, that guy lucked out.  The other thing that's nice is, you know, just mowing down people on the sidewalk.  Oh, just running people over on the sidewalk.  What a fun game.  It's so much fun.  Look at that guy.  Oh, and then he hit a light pole.  He knocked him right into a light pole.  Can you back over someone after you hit him?  Oh, yeah.  Of course you can.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Over and over again.  The other thing, there it goes.  All this blood all over the hood. 
[02:05:00]  How great is this?  The other thing that we changed, he pushed the dumpster over a guy on the physics was  before, you know, when you would drive at high speed and slam into a wall or something,  not much happened to you.  On this, when you slam into a fixed structure, your character will actually fly through the  windshield.  Did you see that?  Lazlo, I don't know if you can answer this question.  A lot of people are asking if it's better to play this game on Xbox or PS3.  Xbox. 
[02:05:30]  And the reason is because we're already working on mission packs.  The Xbox 360 is going to have mission packs that I believe we're going to do one at the  end of the summer.  And it's going to be new missions, new characters, new comedy in the game.  Wow.  So.  All right.  I got that.  Now, what about GTA 4 for the Wii?  No.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  So sorry about that.  Oh, no.  I own every season.  No exercise for you. 
[02:06:00]  Well, oh, wow, because people could have like GTA-cercise and the elderly can play it  and the infirmed and crippled children can work out as they play.  As they run over pedestrians on the bottom.  Take that.  I would.  One suggestion.  Yeah.  If you could put something in very late in the game.  Could you have a Wii that you can use and just whip it and hit people with it so it  would actually be useful for something?  The Wii.  Hold on.  You're playing it wrong.  You're driving down the wrong side of the road. 
[02:06:30]  No, Jimmy.  You're allowed to do that.  You must adhere to the traffic regulations.  You're going to get a ticket.  He's got blood on the hood.  Lazlo.  We were talking about the fenders hanging off.  I love it when people play and they stop at the stoplights.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  I'm stopping.  That's a joke.  I was asking Lazlo during the commercials.  I want to ask you on the air, too.  Grand Theft Auto V.  I know it's way too early, but any type of concept going through your mind or whether  the people at Rockstar. 
[02:07:00]  The guys that founded Rockstar Dan and Sam Hauser have said that there's some stuff kind  of brewing, just some light concepts, but our main focus has been getting this game out  because it has been a three-and-a-half, four-year ordeal between the initial concept, working  on the code, figuring out just the recording of all the people that are in the game.  I mean, like I said, Russians, Italians, and you hear all these languages in the game 
[02:07:30]  when you're walking around those parts of the city.  The recording sessions were for weeks, and they went on every day for 10 hours of people  just in every hour recording hundreds and hundreds of people.  And then having to edit all that, we had a room full of people in front of Pro Tools  editing somebody screaming, Russian, oh my God, and your mother's...  I would think Japan, we were saying off-air, would be an interesting...  Japan would be fun because it's such a bizarre, bizarre culture. 
[02:08:00]  And very, very different than what you guys have done so far.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Maybe some huge international city.  I have an idea.  Grand Theft Auto, the farmhouse.  The whole thing should be set on a farm with one house with one level.  And exactly what do you do?  Do you have a ball in your mouth on the first level?  What do you do?  Actually, there's a horse.  You can rape different farm animals.  That's it.  You have to climb the ladder to get into the chicken coop. 
[02:08:30]  That rascally chicken is the best fit, as we all know.  It could be the sex farm, Jimmy.  Yeah, like in Seattle.  Yeah.  The CTA Sex Farm.  GTA Seattle.  Well, very good.  Everybody rides around with liberal ideology and drinks coffee and kills himself in the rain.  Very exciting.  Dude, I can't believe...  I don't play video games at all.  And I could see that this would somehow change my life.  And I can't get it.  Why?  Why?  Dude, I'm such an addict. 
[02:09:00]  I would literally not want to leave the house.  Don't you think that this...  But you do that now, Jim.  That's why I don't buy a lot of...  You said you have multiple sessions with yourself in front of the computer a day.  I know.  I know.  Wouldn't this be a little bit healthier?  I guess so.  I guess, yeah.  That's why I don't play a lot of video games for exactly what Jimmy's saying.  Because I do have that OCD tendency and I get obsessed very easily on games.  Yeah, but it's okay when you're obsessed with the wire or something like that.  But people somehow perceive that it's bad when you're obsessed with a video game. 
[02:09:30]  Don't worry.  This is one I am picking up.  And I will play for hundreds of hours.  I'm just saying that I pick and choose.  Because I could spend the rest of my life just playing games.  I know that.  My problem is I tend to drink while I play games.  Yeah.  And I get...  You know, playing Call of Duty drunk just does not go over so well.  Especially when some 15-year-old knife you.  So bad.  Drunk.  This is a very good question before we wrap up here.  Tom in New York.  We got Laszlo from Rockstar Games in studio.  What's up, Tom? 
[02:10:00]  Hey, Laszlo.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I've never played that game before.  Is that going to be number four?  Is that going to be easy to pick up?  Or will I have to know a little bit about the game?  I'll have you pinned.  No, the nice thing about Grand Theft Auto is it walks you through very slowly and methodically the controllers.  Because people are always sort of afraid of the controllers of Xbox and PlayStation 3 because there's a lot of buttons.  But we worked really hard on, it's sort of called the training, the controller training. 
[02:10:30]  And it goes on, I mean, for even the first like 20 missions, you're still learning new moves.  And it's very methodical.  And so you'll find yourself picking these moves up very quickly.  So anybody, my chick picked it up and was able to sort it out very fast.  You know what, though?  The beauty of Grand Theft Auto, you could just start the game, jump in a car, and spend hours just exploring the...  Just doing what he's doing, shooting everyone. 
[02:11:00]  Just exploring, man.  Dude, the motion blur is so good in this.  It's not distracting.  Like, look, we put motion blur in.  Yeah.  But when you spin around quick, well, the scenery behind you kind of gets like it would if it's cinematic and you move a camera.  Okay.  You'd get a little bit of motion blur.  It makes it look a lot more realistic.  Yeah, and you'll notice he just shot the tires on the...  The tire gets shot out, yeah.  And you see hissing and that sort of weird smoke that comes out sometimes when you shoot out a tire. 
[02:11:30]  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  Because we all shoot out tires.  Oh, the guy almost went to defend himself with his hands when he got shot and then got it right in the face.  How many people...  Oh, good shot.  There you go.  How many people work on this?  Hundreds.  Hundreds.  Oh, it's doing garbage bales.  The code is assembled at Rockstar North.  Basically, the team that's done Grand Theft Auto is still in place.  The same team has worked on all of them. 
[02:12:00]  Grand Theft Auto 3, San Andreas, Vice City.  Brutal.  The code is done in Scotland.  And then here in New York, we do all the writing and the recording and that stuff.  He's obviously in Chinatown.  He's on a rampage right now.  Chinatown, man.  What's wrong with your leg, Sean?  Yeah, he's bleeding.  Yeah.  You can see blood coming out of his leg.  Yeah, when you get shot in individual places, your body reacts differently.  Also, if your player in Grand Theft Auto 4 gets shot in the leg, you'll start limping. 
[02:12:30]  So now you've got issues as you're trying to flee.  He is wreaking havoc on the police department.  He's shooting a lot of people.  Wow.  It looks like he's played this game a few hundred hours.  And like Laszlo said, these people are all dying differently depending on where they're hit.  And like shot in the face, they fly backwards and go right down.  Sometimes they hold up their hands and try to defend themselves and then you just shoot right through them. 
[02:13:00]  One of the things that we did with this game as well is did a duck and cover system.  So you're able to hide, you know, crouch down and hide behind cars and then pop up and knock out a couple of shots and then go down.  So is there one guy who's kind of like the lead on the whole, like this whole game thing who has to see every screen and go, no, yes, no?  Yes.  Well, it's between three different people.  It's Leslie Benzies, Dan, and Sam Houser are the main three.  But I have to tell you, when this game comes out on April 29th, the offices of Rockstar, especially Rockstar North, 
[02:13:30]  they're shutting them down for a month and telling everybody to just disperse.  Because people are pretty burnt.  There's been a lot of working all day Saturdays and all day Sundays for months and months.  Well, I'll tell you another thing.  I'm picking up the game the second it comes out because I'm sure there's going to be people that don't appreciate the game.  And I don't want to have anybody go, oh, well, we're taming this down or we're doing this. 
[02:14:00]  I want the original version.  It comes out on April 29th.  There is no tamed down version.  Good.  How about instead of guns, he's throwing, like, flowers at people.  Why can't we have that marshmallows?  He catches the marshmallows and then he wins a prize.  It's a helicopter.  He helps people.  He lifts a cow like an apocalypse now.  Well, let's thank Laszlo for stopping by.  Thank you, guys. 
[02:14:30]  April 29th.  It's Tuesday.  A week from Tuesday it comes out.  You can pre-order at GameStop, but it's selling out.  How cool is that in the subway?  He's shooting everyone.  Jimmy's obsessed.  I love it.  It really is fantastic.  And the police are chasing you.  You can run onto a subway that comes from the station and get away.  Dude, I should buy one of these.  Like Gans.  Would you put this in your bedroom or the living room?  Living room.  Get it with your surround sound system.  It's incredible.  I don't have a surround sound.  I play Call of Duty with my surround sound. 
[02:15:00]  And the neighbors, well, they're not sure if it's real or not anyway.  So what am I talking about?  Yeah.  It just sounds amazing.  I love it.  All right.  We're out.  Have a good weekend.  We're off to XM.  Adam.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  In the world of radio shock, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their off-screen. 
[02:15:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk, Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk, Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk, Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk, Opie and Anthony.  Talk talk, Opie and Anthony.  Paris, your strip search was the search of something we like to call the old two-hander.  Did they do the old grip and rip?  This is where it is going.  What is that?  Um, extreme camel toe.  Ew.  Oh, God damn.  Ew.  Oh, God, you got a complete camel toe.  Opie and Anthony.  If you are here, give us a sign. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, boy.  My wallet is gone.  Oh, my God.  It's with us beyond the grave.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, good morning to all the XMers out there in Radio Land.  Is the crowd mic'd?  Say hi, guys. 
[02:17:00]  We got a big crowd today.  Why?  Friday.  It's Friday?  We haven't had a crowd like that on a Friday in a while.  I guess maybe because it's nice and warm out, finally.  That's what it is, too.  People want to travel and check out this horse shit we call a radio show.  That's what it is, too.  We got Laszlo in studio.  He's going to be playing.  Actually, he's not going to be playing.  His guy is going to be playing some more Grand Theft Auto 4.  Where are you?  Sean, the professional tester guy.  He's one of our lead analysts.  He plays the game, and when stuff doesn't make sense, he sends notes back to the code 
[02:17:30]  guys and says, hey, maybe you should change this.  Dude, that must be the best job ever.  All you do is sit and play games all day.  That's what he hears all the time.  Sean, how many hours have you played the game?  Would you guess?  In a given day?  No, just overall, getting the game ready for the consumers.  16 months, 10 to 15 hours a day, easily.  Six, seven days a week, usually.  That's got to be.  It's a lot of hours.  It's got to be 20, 30 hours.  Perhaps it wasn't that, Anthony. 
[02:18:00]  Are you pretty much sick of the game at this point?  You can be honest.  Not at all.  No, I love the game.  Come on.  Rockstar's not going to kill you.  They've got to understand that.  No, dude, they will.  You think they will?  They will kill him with machine guns.  None of us are tired of the game.  We still love it.  And if this gets tiresome at all, jump into multiplayer.  It's another game.  All right, now you've played, obviously, hundreds, thousands of hours.  What's your favorite part of the game?  Strip clubs are pretty awesome.  It gives you a feeling of being a little dirty.  If I'm in the office and I'm testing it, for instance, I have to look over my shoulder. 
[02:18:30]  I sort of feel a little awkward about that.  It's a very awesome effect.  An SFW.  Ho, ho, ho.  An SFW.  Flying the helicopters around is a shitload of fun.  There's no end of things you can do that will be entertaining.  Yeah.  The other thing is, like, you're constantly discovering stuff.  Like, I just found out that there's a Hummer limo in it yesterday.  And I had no idea that it's not a Hummer.  It's called the Patriot.  Of course, yeah.  There's always, it's so vast. 
[02:19:00]  And there's so many people working on it.  What was really cool is, like, a year and a half ago is when I first got my build, because  basically, as each week, a new build comes out, and it's instantly downloaded to the  Xbox in your office.  So, but you can be driving down the street, and a street would just end.  And you would, and Nico would drive over into oblivion.  And its character is just falling, falling into, like, empty space.  It was so bizarre.  Into infinity.  But it was really cool watching the whole city kind of come together, and people would 
[02:19:30]  post signs up.  You know, we're thinking of putting some construction workers here.  If you have any problem with that, or it messes up one of your missions, let us know.  There'd just be signs floating in space in the middle of the street, and watching the  stuff that keeps getting added in week after week, and the detail keeps getting more and  more.  I love the people that sit around smoking and talking, because you find yourself just, just  like in New York, the weird tidbits of conversation that you hear, it's the same thing.  Two people will be standing outside the financial center, you know, having these jack-off conversations 
[02:20:00]  about spreadsheets and returns and stuff, and you just stand there and listen to them.  Hey, Lazlo, we've got to get to our guests, but what's coming up, we're going to play  some unedited clips from Grand Theft Auto 4 that we couldn't play on the other side.  Also, something very interesting is going on.  We have, how many?  Two, four, six, about 12 flat screens in here.  And I've got to apologize to the studio audience today.  Rockstar Games is so paranoid that one of you guys would take a screen cap with your 
[02:20:30]  cell phones that we could only play Grand Theft Auto 4 on this one screen that is facing  us over here in the studio.  You can't see it, you bunch of pirates.  But maybe we could get like a line, and they could come in and ooh and ah for a couple seconds  each so they could at least see what it looks like.  Yeah, that would be bad.  But Rockstar is really paranoid that some kind of footage would get out on the internet  before the release date.  This thing's in lockdown.  Like, he and I have security keys for this Xbox, and we each carry separate...  Dude, I'm telling you. 
[02:21:00]  Turn your key, sir.  It is a scene.  It is a...  Oh, is that how you prevent it from being stolen from you or something like that?  Correct.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  There's armed guards around all the warehouses.  I'm downloading a copy right now on this computer.  Xnay.  It's put on torrents somewhere.  Yeah.  That's why I knew that if I ever saw or went to Taiwan or whatever and saw them selling  a copy, I would have to kill the street vendor.  Because my buddy picked up a...  We worked our asses off on San Andreas, and my buddy picked up a copy for a dollar in Taiwan. 
[02:21:30]  I was like, I would have burned that little man's booth down.  Just knowing how much work you put into this game.  Yeah, exactly.  What a shit.  The stress you felt.  Yeah.  You know the sexual favors you could get in Taiwan for a buck?  Jesus.  Forget the game.  Hey, we got very, very popular people.  Very famous people sitting over there, and we're just babbling.  Chris Carter is here.  We got Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. 
[02:22:00]  Right?  I said it right?  Oh, my God.  I really say someone's name right.  Mosey on over here.  Of course.  Very excited about this.  From the X-Files.  Yes.  Very excited about the project.  Are you guys video gamers at all?  Do you play any video games, or you just don't have time?  Not really.  My kids do.  Your kids?  What's their favorite game?  Mario Kart.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're younger, so.  That's a cute, safe game.  That's adorable.  Exactly.  But that's, you know, that's cool.  It's parenting, too.  That's right.  You know, I mean, some, I think some kids can take some violent content, and others get 
[02:22:30]  a little, you know, crazy with it.  Yeah.  So, you know, I think it's up to the parent.  I hate when people try to legislate against gaming or movies, things like that, entertainment  things, because I think it's all based on individual personality and what people can  handle and what they can't.  Some 16-year-olds can handle some heavier stuff.  And then you've got people that are 18 that can't handle it.  So, I think the, you know, I think it should be up to the parents.  They know their kids best.  What am I babbling about? 
[02:23:00]  How are you guys doing?  This is typical Anthony interviewing stars.  Yeah, I just, like, babble away at things.  No, no, it gets fanboyish at times.  Yeah, you know.  You're a big X-Files guy.  Huge.  You know, I'm the guy with the box sets that are all over the house, and every so often  you pop them in, it's great.  Look, I'm babbling again.  Why don't you describe it?  Hold on.  Describe what furniture they usually sell.  Usually, I think it's on a little wooden table.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Okay.  People want to know about the movie. 
[02:23:30]  People want to know what's going on with the movie.  We made it.  You made it.  We're keeping it a big secret right now.  It's like, there's got to be a little tidbit you could give us about, perhaps, where, what  time frame is this in?  It takes place in the, actually, it takes place now, six years later.  Six years later.  Now, are we going to get a little bit of a fill-in on what happened in that missing six  years?  Sort of. 
[02:24:00]  Sort of.  Yeah.  It'll all make sense.  Okay, well, any flashbacks so we could bring back some beloved characters or not-so-beloved  that are perhaps gone?  Uh-huh.  There may be characters from this.  How are we going to do this interview if you're not going to give us anything?  This is good.  This is good.  All right.  Because you've got to kind of be like Mulder here.  I've got to kind of fish out a little info from this.  Don't make us bring in Master Poe to get some answers out of you. 
[02:24:30]  I'll put you in a headlock or something.  I don't know what.  You'll be confessing the entire movie plot.  We've never had to actually assault a guest to get information out of him, but we're not  beyond doing that.  But, yeah, I mean, the show obviously had a huge impact when it came out.  It was a giant, huge fan base.  And it didn't really wrap up, did it?  You can talk about the show.  Yeah.  Well, the show kind of wrapped up.  There was a natural ending to it, but we sort of set up the movie, I think. 
[02:25:00]  I think you'll see that in the movie, it's a natural extension of the TV show.  Okay.  But it's not about aliens.  It's not about the conspiracy.  It's more a standalone, scary story with Mulder.  Oh, okay.  So you don't have to be a fan or know any of the show in order to see the movie, obviously.  It's nice if you are, but you don't have to be.  Yeah.  That's smart.  Very smart.  Because I enjoyed the first movie when the series was still on. 
[02:25:30]  I really liked that.  That was kind of a standalone thing also.  Yeah.  And great.  So did you have any trouble getting the cast back?  No, they wanted to come back.  Oh, they did?  Really, David was lobbying for the movie, and we actually started working on it like five  years ago.  Wow.  And then there was a little disagreement between Fox and me about some money issues.  Oh, that always comes down to that, doesn't it?  Well, thank God I would love to see David Duchovny in that role, because if he does one more 
[02:26:00]  of these goddamn romantic comedy things that I've got to see him in.  You know, the guy, you see him in the X-Files, he's a great, cool guy, nice.  And then there he is in one of these schlocky romantic comedies.  People make fun of him for those movies?  I don't want to tell him he said that.  We've had him on.  We've had him on, I told him.  We've had him on promoting those movies.  I put the bug in his ear to do an X-Files movie, for God's sake.  What are you doing? 
[02:26:30]  Have you seen Californication?  Yes, I have.  Yeah.  It is good.  Yeah.  I didn't mind that, but...  You want Mulder.  Yeah.  I mean, every so often you just want to see him reprise that classic role.  You'll be happy then.  What have you been up to since the X-Files?  I did a lot of stuff.  I just took a bunch of time off, and it was...  I said it was ten years of extreme output, and I wanted ten years of extreme input.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So you just kind of hung out?  I did.  Wait, it's been ten years?  No, no, I'm sorry. 
[02:27:00]  It's...  You scared me.  It's been six years.  Wow.  It's got to be still, though.  Yeah, no kidding.  No.  Seems like yesterday.  You guys are going to Comic-Con tonight, I think, right?  Yeah.  Here in New York.  Are you going to show any of the film?  Because that was speculated on that you might show a clip.  I think we're showing...  Are we showing the trailer?  The trailer.  People have already seen it, so we're not...  It's amazing what fans will grasp onto.  Like...  And the trailer is...  You guys are showing a commercial.  I kind of like that.  The trailer are clips that aren't even in the movie.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with the movie.  It's a secret.  It's just walking to the studio. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Billy Connolly's in the movie.  I know he's a friend.  Yeah, yeah.  He's very good.  I love Billy.  Yeah.  Billy's a hilarious funny, funny guy.  Very funny guy, yeah.  Does he play a comic role in the movie?  Or is it funny?  Or is it dramatic?  Depending on how you look at it.  It's a positive, maybe, answer.  It'll be funny for some, though.  So you hung loose and got the cast back together.  Yeah.  That's good.  Everybody's pretty psyched about it.  Now, do you have...  What's his name there? 
[02:28:00]  You know, T-2000 is...  Who's T-2000?  What's his name?  Patrick.  Oh, Robert Patrick.  Oh, that T-2000.  Robert Patrick?  Possibly.  Possibly.  Because...  Now, I can tell you, actually, he's not in the movie.  Yeah, because that's kind of when people were like, you know...  We kind of like Mulder.  And it's kind of hard.  I watched the entire thing right up until the end.  You know, I've seen every episode multiple times and everything.  So, but...  It kind of...  It changed the show, obviously, when Mulder was gone. 
[02:28:30]  And occasionally you'd see him with fishhooks in his cheeks.  And then that's kind of the resolution that I was looking for that I never really got,  though, was what happened to Mulder during that whole thing.  Any answers to that, perhaps?  No, actually, I have no answers to that.  No answers.  And the movie doesn't answer that either, so maybe those answers are...  Oh, okay.  So, over this six-year period between when the show left off and the movie, 
[02:29:00]  did stuff happen that will be addressed in the movie?  Yes.  All right, there you go.  You got a yes, Anthony.  You got an answer.  Congratulations.  I'm lost.  No, lost is another show.  Yeah.  A plane crash.  Are they on an island?  You don't want to...  Where is it?  In heaven?  So, I've never seen the X-Files.  I've never...  Where have you been?  Believe me, I know.  I'm not...  Lost.  Lost, yeah.  No, I'm awful. 
[02:29:30]  I get box sets and I just buy them, like...  Well, they have a couple of those for the X-Files.  So, what happened?  Did David Duchovny left the series or he didn't do the first movie?  No, he left the series for a time.  Oh, okay.  And then, what's his name?  Robert Patrick?  Yeah.  Was in, okay.  And was David Duchovny in the first movie?  He was.  Okay, and he's in this one?  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  All caught up.  There you go.  Let's say hi to Eric in Indiana, it looks like.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I just wanted to ask Chris if he's got any, like, little scenes in this movie like he did  in the first movie where Mulder exits the bar and promptly pisses all over Independence Day 
[02:30:00]  poster.  We've got to get you, you have to repeat your question.  We've got to get Chris Carr some headphones.  You've got to get your headphones.  You were in some limbo state there.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Do it again there.  Oh, no.  I just wanted to ask Chris if there's any scenes in this movie, like the first movie where  Mulder leaves the bar and then promptly pisses all over Independence Day poster.  No, he's already pissed on that poster.  So, no pissing on posters in this movie.  No poster pissing.  Why did he piss on the poster?  Was that like a slam at the movie? 
[02:30:30]  He's actually pissed underneath the poster, but people took it that he pissed on the  poster.  It pissed a lot of people off, actually.  That's all right, though.  Yeah.  Why?  Did you guys feel competitive with that flick?  No, no.  It was kind of an inside joke because that movie was about aliens, too.  So, it was competitive.  That kind of, The X-Files, I always thought it was kind of inspired by The Night Stalker.  Yeah.  Remember that show?  Yeah.  What was it?  It was Direct Descendant.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  I used to watch that as a kid, and that was very interesting.  You're dating yourself.  I know.  Well, I'm 40-flurf, as I say.  40-flurf.  Never give my age out.  See, because I'm recently single, and I enjoy the company of younger women.  So, if I just say 40-flurf, it doesn't sound like 46.  Wow.  Are you really?  Jesus.  I just threw a number out there, Jimmy.  That's nice.  You got 40 years on her.  Terrible, terrible man. 
[02:31:30]  So, you guys, I would probably more of like a, and just from the reputation of the show,  and I know more of a hardcore kind of a vibe with aliens, and like Independence Day kind  of was like a little bit of fluff.  I mean, not that we want to shit on the movie, but it was a little bit of...  Well, it's sort of the opposite of what X-Files tries to do.  Because X-Files tries to make you think it's real.  It could really be happening.  Obviously, aliens are not.  Yeah, I think the format of the X-Files, too, is pretty unique in that you had a running  storyline threaded through the whole thing that occasional weeks would hit on, but then 
[02:32:00]  you'd have storylines that just had nothing to do with that thread of conspiracy and stuff,  which were very interesting.  Yeah, it was really flexible that way.  Yeah.  The fans would come back even though one thing had nothing to do with the other.  And then at the beginning, sometimes there'd be a little quote up there at the beginning  that was different.  Yes.  Then what was the normal one that was usually on?  The truth is out there.  Yeah, the truth is out there.  And people just were like, oh, what does that mean?  And they'd go to websites and try to figure out what that meant as far as the episode went. 
[02:32:30]  Did you guys do things on purpose?  Did it mean anything?  Were you screwing with people?  Always.  Always just screwing with people?  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  It always meant something.  It was interesting because people were, like you said, they'd check it out.  They'd go online.  And so we were able to sort of grow with the internet.  And it was like cross-pollination between the internet.  Yeah, because that really was, at the same time as the advent of the internet and really 
[02:33:00]  taking off and people getting on websites for TV shows, people really speculated as to what  was going on with the X-Files.  And that definitely helped the show out, I'm sure.  Yeah, now it's, everybody does that.  All the shows have a direct connection to their fan base.  I mean, they're sort of in direct contact with them 24 hours a day.  And exclusive, sometimes exclusive material.  We brought up Lost before.  That's a show that I think, I think that show owes a bit to the X-Files in that there  are these multiple storylines and a common thread that happens. 
[02:33:30]  And boy, they do have quite the internet base.  Yeah.  Bunch of freaks.  You must have, at some point, gotten a lot of strange emails from people speculating and  asking questions.  Yeah, and lots of, you know, fans and lots of angry people, too.  Angry people.  You can't piss people off.  Yeah.  I wonder what it is about that type of program that gets people so passionate and, and like  Star Trek with the original Trekkies. 
[02:34:00]  They get so passionate about it and almost live it as if it's real.  Yeah.  And, and, and get angry at the creators and writers and, and just have such a passion for  the show.  There was one woman who said she hated me with the power of a thousand burning suns.  What an arrogant bitch.  What did you, I know.  What did you do?  I mean, what could you possibly have done?  It's a show.  Yeah, no kidding.  A thousand burning suns.  Like, 865 is not enough. 
[02:34:30]  Well, it's nothing.  It is a big compliment.  It's a compliment that they feel that invested in.  But you go to the conventions and you get the feeling from a lot of the fans that they  feel like they know the show better than you do.  That it's actually their show and you're sort of in the way.  Yeah, that's how we feel about this program.  These bastards think they run it.  Will, I, I, I gotta ask this and I think you could probably answer.  I hope you can either.  Uh, Mulder and Scully, updated cell phones?  Actually, that's a, that's a, you're getting a big laugh. 
[02:35:00]  Uh, yes, uh, in, yes.  I get a yes!  Another yes, man.  Because besides, uh, Mulder's hair, I think it's the only thing that really dates the show  is the cell phone where they pull out the antenna, they got the big block cell phone,  can never get reception when they really need it.  Scully, always in trouble, never has a signal.  If you think about it, the show couldn't have been done before cell phones.  They would never have been able to talk to each other.  No, they couldn't talk to each other. 
[02:35:30]  Hey, when does the movie actually come out?  Uh, July 25th.  Well, did you delay it because you didn't want to compete with, uh, 88 Minutes?  On Pacino's blockbuster.  That opens today to zero stars.  Aw.  We've been teasing that stupid film all day.  Zero stars for Pacino's new films.  Something happened.  Did the critics treat you guys well or did they kind of, uh, they kind of dump on you?  Yeah, what was the critical reaction of the first movie?  Uh, I think people liked it generally.  I mean, uh, yeah, I think they, it was a, it was a good reaction to it. 
[02:36:00]  I mean, yeah.  It's, you always have your, uh, you know, they're always the haters and stuff, especially with  something that's popular in, in popular culture.  Uh, the critics like to, um, kind of poo-poo that.  Yep.  Make some, uh, they, they have to be above all that, I guess.  That's the nice thing, though, coming back after six years, is you get to hear what people  think of the show six years later, and it's been pretty, pretty nice, actually.  It's like, people have missed it, or missed the characters, and they, they remember the  show fondly, and, you know.  Yeah, I think it's a good time. 
[02:36:30]  Not too much time has passed where you look and go, whoa, stop.  Yeah.  He's a little too old to be doing that.  Yeah.  And, uh, it hasn't been such a short period of time where it's like, come on, we just  saw the show.  Yeah, exactly.  They look great, actually.  Dave and Jillian look good.  Yeah, well, last time we saw David Duchovny, he, uh, oh, he looks fantastic.  We went out to dinner, and, uh.  I think, I think when he came in, I said, David, you haven't aged.  I always know what to say.  You look fantastic.  Hey, um, um, do you guys, like, when you're, like, when you're in between, like, you know, 
[02:37:00]  you got six years between doing films, are you doing, like, theater and stuff like that?  A lot of actors just get so bored with being known as the same role all the time, they just  want to go out, and, like, you know, Gandolfini always wants to go out and do some weird  thing, I mean.  Right.  That's the end, Mike.  Yeah.  I just stopped.  Uh, as far as, uh, David and Jillian go, I mean, Jillian did theater in London where  she lives, and, um, David, I don't think, did any theater, but, you know, they stayed  busy.  David put out fruity movies, and, uh, Jillian, uh, what was she in?  She was in, um, she was in, uh, Bleak House and, uh, Last King of Scotland. 
[02:37:30]  Last King of Scotland, which I didn't even recognize her.  Yeah, she was blonde in it.  I didn't recognize her, and then I'm looking going, holy shit, I know what that is.  That was interesting, too.  On the movie, they both had a hard time getting back into the roles, harder than they expected,  because they spent six years trying to be anything but Mulder and Scully, and then they  had to sort of remember what that was and imagine them six years down the line.  And so it was...  With a show that had an impact like that, that was so popular, it would probably be very  easy to be typecast. 
[02:38:00]  I think that's probably why they went so quickly into other movie roles that were so far apart  from that.  So, yeah, getting back to it, what did they do to, uh, kind of get back into those roles?  Just put the clothes on?  You know, on the suit?  More takes.  They just had to keep working at it to get their heads into that space again.  Yeah, the chemistry came back, though.  Did they have, because there was some, you know, the tabloids always get on there that  the two didn't get along well, or was there any problem with that, really?  Never.  No? 
[02:38:30]  Because Jillian is, um, not like her character at all.  No, it's funny, because both of them are unlike their characters.  Yeah.  They're the opposite of their characters.  Yeah, Jillian's, like, um, very earthy, kind of hippie-ish, and, uh, comes across as  a very straight, straight-laced doctor.  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know, Mulder's, uh, Mulder's funny, though, and he's been, he was funny on  the show.  He's a very funny man.  So, uh, Jillian was 24 when she started the series. 
[02:39:00]  Jeez.  Yeah.  Wow.  How many years were you on?  Uh, nine years.  Okay, so she's, well, she's, she's, I'm not saying it like that.  She's 40, right?  Oh, wow, she's 40-flurf.  No, I don't, I don't mean that in a, in an awful way.  Like, I'm just saying that's, that's a long time to have a, a good gig.  I mean, nine years on a show is just fantastic.  Hollywood could do wonders, though.  Yeah.  She'll look exactly the same, I'm sure.  Yeah, they're gonna, uh, as far as updating it like that, uh, have, have they, uh, you'll  never answer this.  How about this? 
[02:39:30]  Have they been together over the six years?  Has there been a, a, a, a relationship of some sort?  Are they getting back together for the first time?  I don't mean together, like, romantically, it's not moonlighting we're talking about  here, but, uh, you know, it's.  I, I, I, I think they actually saw one another a few times during the, during.  Oh, okay, so it hasn't been a working relationship or anything like that, which is nice.  Oh, good.  Wow, I got something out of there, that's nice, okay.  Ring the bell.  Yes, I need a little, got some info out of him.  Ring.  I have a question. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Does David Duchovny die?  Jeez.  How does the movie end?  Yes, tell us the ending.  That's all we want to know.  What are you thinking at Comic-Con when you're talking to all the people?  Like, as you're saying hello, are you just thinking, nerd?  Nerd, nerd, nerd.  Fanboy, fanboy, fanboy.  Are you guys signing tonight, or are you just doing quick?  No, we're signing.  Oh, okay, so you'll probably have quite a line, right?  Yes.  What are you going to be signing?  Anything they bring up, or are you guys, like, selling pictures?  I usually sign almost anything people bring up. 
[02:40:30]  Almost.  Yeah, they're going to have the poster.  What won't you sign?  I don't like signing breasts all that much.  Especially when they just flop them on the table.  Those icky breasts.  That's the only thing I will sign.  Do you, do you get people that go, because there's always the stereotypical Comic-Con fan,  and do you get the ones that come up and pick out a specific episode and a detail  and want you to tell them about it, and you have no idea what they're talking about?  Most of the fans know more about the show than I do now.  Yeah?  Yes. 
[02:41:00]  It's got to be awkward.  I mean, but they're your fan base.  Uh, yeah.  That's who they are.  Yep.  It's not for them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd be doing what?  Yes.  I don't know.  It is, but I don't know.  Do you feel like you've been typecast?  I mean, that's probably a stupid question.  It's such a successful thing, but is it, like, hard to say, I want to go out, or are  you just happy where you are?  You don't, you do nothing else you'd rather be doing?  No, I'm happy to be doing this.  Nobody wants to be typecast, because it's sort of, you know, it limits who you know that  you are.  So, uh, I'm, I, I have other stuff I want to do, actually. 
[02:41:30]  Tell you a guy like Joe Pesci, who's in such a variety of roles.  I mean, from the character in Raging Bull to Casino, to Big Fellas.  And then he sneaks in with a Jimmy Hollywood.  You're like, this is variety.  Do you ever go to, like, a Wikipedia to, like, you've forgotten about certain episodes,  and you go to, like, a Wikipedia site or a fan site to remind yourself?  Yes.  That's, uh, yeah.  We did that on Grand Theft Auto, because they have chronicled everything that we've done,  and the series spans from, you know, 84 to current day. 
[02:42:00]  And I'll be sitting there with my co-writer, and we're like, what was that thing that we  did back then?  And then, you know, you pop up Wikipedia, like, oh, yeah.  Does the hooker get bludgeoned in Grand Theft Auto?  Uh, can you answer that, uh, Laszlo?  Uh, I can't say it.  Ah, damn it, I knew I wouldn't get anything out of here.  I like the way Laszlo snuck in that plug.  I know, he's amazing like that.  Yes.  Speaking of the X-Files, have they ever shot around Caroline's on Broadway, the comedy club?  Where Jimmy's going to be appearing.  The, uh, the, the series did have so many, uh, uh, peripheral characters that were really 
[02:42:30]  strong, important.  I mean, the cigarette-smoking man was probably one of the best, uh, villains in TV history.  Uh, it, it seems like that, that being such an important part of the series, it's going  to be hard to, in, in maybe a two-hour movie, develop peripheral characters like that.  Uh.  How do you get past something like that when it was so important to the show?  That's a good question.  It is a damn good, as I was saying it, I'm like, holy shit, that's a good question. 
[02:43:00]  That's going to be a good one, yeah.  Oof, just say, ah, you'll find out in the movie.  I can't answer that.  Can't answer that.  Uh, any cigarette-smoking man in there?  Uh, maybe not.  Maybe?  Maybe not.  Maybe, maybe not.  Uh, that was a no.  By the way.  I saw him, I saw him go like this.  By the way, a little too, well, he took quite a spill in the, uh, show, and I don't think  he was getting up.  Don't spoil it.  That was in the series.  That was serious.  All right.  What, are you going to watch, 18,000 box sets?  Why not?  I did it with The Wire, I did it with Lost, I caught up, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Nine years.  Nine years, Jimmy.  Of programming.  You're not talking about an HBO show that goes, two years, and then they give up.  Nine years, it's fine, it's great.  Nine years.  And they didn't give up, they canceled us, and it was one year.  He was in Lucky Louie on HBO.  Yeah.  Great show that they, they took off.  Yeah, kind of like The X-Files, except your box sets a little higher.  Ours is more of a leaflet.  Here, enjoy it.  Now, cigarette-smoking man, uh, obviously, what was the actor's name?  Uh, Bill Davis.  Yeah.  Bill Davis.  Didn't smoke.  That's true.  A little bit of trivia, and I heard that those were clove cigarettes? 
[02:44:00]  They were clove cigarettes.  That he smoked?  And what were they called?  They were, um...  Morley's.  Morley's, of course, looking like the Marlboro.  That I remember.  The Morley's.  Yeah, he was a great character, and, uh, yeah, like I said, um, tried doing that in a movie,  but, uh, I guess we'll have to see.  Wait and see.  Yeah, wait and see.  Hey, is Big Kev here?  Because we, one of our guys...  He's right behind you there, Jimmy.  Where's Big Kev?  Oh, there he is.  He's looking all big over there.  Oh, okay.  Big Kev probably knows more about the movie than, uh, no? 
[02:44:30]  No?  You don't?  Are you a big X-Miles fan?  Kind of?  What?  Did he just give you the wishy-washy?  No, he wasn't the wishy-washy, like, eh, kind of.  Kind of, but I'll get him to sign something, for God's sake.  I didn't take that as him shit on the show.  I just, you know, it's like, have you seen a lot of them?  Big Kev, everyone.  I've seen a whole bunch, yeah.  Geek extraordinaire, by the way.  I don't have any of them on DVD, and I'd like to get the box set, but I don't have it right now.  Which means if you guys have an extra copy, if you want to get them on the arm, Kev likes free shit. 
[02:45:00]  Okay, we all do.  What's the average weight at Comic-Con?  Oh, what's that?  Oh, what?  No, nothing.  I'm going to tear it up now, funny man.  Oh, no.  Is that a signed picture of Malcolm McDowell?  Yes, it is.  Jerk off.  I apologize.  Whatever you need signed, we'll make happen for you, sweetie.  I'll drink out of your mule while they're signing it.  You've got a signed picture of Malcolm McDowell for me, because I'm a clockwork fanatic, as we all are.  Of course.  Who isn't?  Who isn't?  Yeah.  Well, when's the movie come out?  July 25th.  July 25th.  Gentlemen, thanks so much.  Thank you. 
[02:45:30]  Thank you.  Very insightful.  In some ways.  In some ways, right?  Absolutely.  You've got a little something out of it.  I'm thrilled to meet you.  I'm a huge fan of the show and can't wait to see the movie.  Let me get the plug, too, because these guys tonight are going to be, actually, all weekend  at the New York Comic-Con.  Are you only there tonight or are you there all the time?  Okay, I almost completely screwed that up.  They're there tonight at Comic-Con at Jacob Javits Center here in New York City, and I think  at what time?  7.30 you'll be there?  Autographs at 5, and then we speak at 7.30.  Okay, maybe.  Autographs at 5, so get there at least 10 of to make sure that you're online. 
[02:46:00]  You know, and bring as much stuff as you want to sign, because they really love that,  and ask a lot of questions about the show.  Remember that one, were you?  And they're going to speak about the film and possibly show a clip, but they said they're  just going to show the trailer.  But thank you guys so much, man.  The show's a massive success.  Yeah.  Thanks.  I cannot wait to see it.  Thanks.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thanks.  All right, guys.  Oh, s***.  The virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, O.P.  Ah! 
[02:46:30]  Ah!  Hang back, you f***!  Shut your mouth!  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Oh, dude, don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  And it was better than my first kiss.  Ah, laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  I hope you and Anthony on your radio dial.  We want to thank Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz from the X-Files movie for coming on and giving 
[02:47:00]  us nothing, no information.  As soon as we went to break, I looked at Anthony and I applauded.  I actually went like this and I went to Anthony Bravo and I applauded you.  Thank you, sir.  For attempting to get something going with that.  Very hard.  Not trashing anyone, but that was like pulling teeth.  Tight lips.  Very tight lips.  It's like they say, loose lips.  Why not? 
[02:47:30]  All we're asking for from some of you people, Laszlo has done it.  He brought in Grand Theft Auto 4 for us, so we get a nice sneak peek.  One of the first to get to see the game in action.  Like some of these other people.  It's like, just give us a little something that'll go all over the place on the internet.  Now, those are the creators.  It's not going to hurt you.  It's not going to hurt you in the end.  Come on.  Those are the creators, right?  Yep.  Well, Jimmy seemed to be under the impression they were actors.  A lot of people in instant feedback said that, too.  Oh, they weren't actors?  I have no fucking idea who they were.  Do you find yourself like a hero and they're looking at him like, what are you talking about? 
[02:48:00]  I don't know.  Did you do any Broadway?  I was wondering why you kept talking about the other actors.  Chris Carr is the creator of the X-Files.  I'm fucking good for me.  All right.  So the instant feedback was accurate.  I have no fucking idea.  The instant feedback was coming in and a lot of people going, I think Jimmy thinks that  they're actors.  I thought they were the two leads in the show.  Oh, my God.  That's hysterical.  I swear to God.  Are you kidding? 
[02:48:30]  That would be hysterical.  What a dope.  That's like asking Oliver Stone.  So do you act in theater when you're not starring in the movies?  What a fucking asshole I am.  But they didn't call me out on it either.  No.  They tried to tactfully move it towards, like, when you ask if they're typecast or whatever,  they're like, well, sometimes David and Jillian are typecast.  Oh, I just thought they were trying to be polite.  You know the stars of the show.  Oh, good.  When you ask the typecast question, I'm thinking, well, that maybe is a good question to ask,  like, a creator of the X-Files.  No, I said, do you do theater? 
[02:49:00]  Believe me, they knew exactly how fucking I did not recognize either one of them.  Oh, absolutely.  Jimmy, it's very interesting what you know.  It's extremely interesting knowing you because you have a lot of knowledge, but it's very  different than a lot of other people, especially when it comes to, like, pop culture.  Like, some of the questions you've been asking about Grand Theft Auto have been quite interesting.  Like, you've never seen this game before.  No.  But I got to say right now, I'm proud of me.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  For not recognizing those guys.  I kept trying to steer him back. 
[02:49:30]  Like, well, I'm sure that, you know, the actors did it, and then he would bring up  another fucking actor reference.  You know, but now we did get something out of that whole last segment.  Yeah.  I'm an idiot.  They looked uncomfortable.  How could they not be?  I fucking was asking them questions that were meant for other men.  And the woman.  One man and one woman.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Fucking Duchovny and the bra.  That's Mulder and Scully?  That's Mulder and Scully.  I swear to God.  Come on, Jimmy.  No way.  I swear to God.  I'll be honest. 
[02:50:00]  I never even really watched The X-Files, and I know that.  I was trying to figure out which one of them was Mulder.  I am not.  I swear to God.  How the fuck do I know Mulder?  How do you know?  I mean, it was one of the most successful shows on television.  It was nine years.  Dude, I heard it was great.  I've just never seen it.  You couldn't escape The X-Files when it was out, man.  It was everywhere.  I escaped it.  Honestly.  Jimmy escaped it.  You know what?  The escape artist.  That was pretty much.  And Anthony did his job.  Trust me.  I'm not even sure.  What Mike is.  Something's rumbling. 
[02:50:30]  Everyone grab their mics.  No?  That was fun, but...  I'm hurt.  All right.  Whoever's mic this is gets to go home early.  Oh, please be mine.  Oh, it's not mine.  Please be mine.  Anthony?  Talk over to me.  Oh, damn it.  Anthony.  Am I on the radio?  Jimmy?  Oh!  Am I on the radio?  Yes, you're on.  Hold on.  Am I on the radio?  Goodbye, Laszlo.  Laszlo.  What the fuck?  Try the other one, Laszlo.  No, it's back.  You can...  Okay.  All right.  No, but now it's totally off. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Use Thans.  Thans doesn't really use it.  I can't fucking believe I thought they were the actors.  Oh, my God.  Here's the problem.  It's not...  Oh, it's not plugged in.  Yeah.  All right.  That's better.  All right.  Very good.  Don't worry, Mars.  Settle down.  Settle down.  I don't want to say Mars wasn't going to help, but he ran in with water to throw on  it.  Mars panics because he thinks everyone in Washington listens to everywhere we say as reality.  Like, oh, fuck.  Will you guys stop fucking around?  I'm going to get fired for this.  Mars does summer stock when he's not doing engineering for this. 
[02:51:30]  I didn't know.  You guys do theater.  I can't...  You do theater.  Yes, I create...  I can't wait to listen to the replay now and hear all your questions.  Oh, I know.  I fucking told you were the actors.  Wait, can you get some of the questions now?  You thought it was Mulder and Scully.  I swear to God.  Who the fuck knows?  Get every question Jimmy asked about the playing actors.  Please.  Someone go get that.  And fucking Duchovny.  I'm like, wait a minute.  He was in the X-Files.  I know that.  Dude, Duchovny was on our show.  No, I know who he is.  And I know he was in the star of the X-Files, but I didn't know the character names. 
[02:52:00]  As you're saying that, I'm picturing one of these guys pulling on the  at the cell phone.  No.  I'm like, which one could never get his...  That was usually Scully.  Who's Scully?  She's Gillian Anderson.  Oh.  Oh.  Who the fuck would I know that?  Skull fucky.  All right, listen.  Oh, Jesus H.  Christ.  What happened?  What?  The Pope's here in New York.  I gotta get out of here.  Yeah, what'd you think he was gonna...  Pope Benedict taking a helicopter from JFK to Wall Street.  He already did.  To Wall Street.  Okay, so he's downtown.  And then they're gonna drive him up? 
[02:52:30]  He's taking the Continental fucking helicopter.  The Pope is...  Oh, Jesus.  He's swinging a miss.  There's the Pope.  I'm kidding.  I didn't miss it.  I know.  His big hat is sticking through the top of the helicopter.  The rotor's smacking.  Put your hat down.  Oh, man.  How funny would that be?  Coming in.  Look at this guy.  Hot shot pilot bringing in the Pope.  He's rocking.  Yeah.  It might be the Pope driving the helicopter.  He likes to fly.  We learned that yesterday.  He's a pilot Pope.  How the fuck does that go in the air? 
[02:53:00]  It's good to see how big that helicopter is.  Lamarines.  Good to see former Hitler youth treated with such a...  Yes.  It is really nice.  Look, they have three helicopters.  Exactly the same one.  You shoot one down, you don't know if you got the Pope.  You shoot the Pope.  Shoot the Pope.  I think that's actually a mission.  Yes.  There it is.  I know.  Are we watching GTA here?  You can't tell.  It's the Pope mission.  The new graphics are so terrific.  I don't know which one's the TV.  I fucking hate the way his plane is named Shepard One. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, I know.  Hey, guys, as we just babble and make this up, we got a huge studio audience.  We're gonna move them inside today.  We haven't moved people inside in a long time.  So everyone get up.  We're gonna move the bleachers inside.  Big Kev, scram.  They're sitting right where you're sitting.  Let's get Big Kev over here where he belongs at the table of honor.  The Pope's driving to get his car spray painted so the cops aren't on him right now.  He's going to go to the pay and spray.  Pay and spray.  Pay and spray.  Wolves.  Ever since you guys brought that up, I love listening to him talk in that weird German, 
[02:54:00]  effeminate German accent.  It is very, he's very susso.  He's got shoes.  Wow.  There are so many people here today.  I don't know why.  Why did everyone come today?  There are so many people.  Go back out.  We need to bring in the bleachers.  What?  Oh, this is really well organized.  Now you screwed that up.  These guys are too fat to be moving around too much.  That guy raided Steve C's closet.  You just gave that guy more exercise than he has in 10 years.  He raided Steve C's closet and bumped into Steve in there. 
[02:54:30]  It does look like Big Kev brought it up from Comic-Con.  It was a good one.  Yeah, did you bring these people from Comic-Con there, Big Kev?  I loved Comic-Con.  I had so much fun.  You did.  I really did, man.  Yeah.  All right, we got bleachers.  Good to see people and you go, oh, I know who that is.  Do you know a lot of people at the New York one?  Any big ones at the New York?  Kev, give me top three people that are going to be at the Comic-Con.  I heard Edward Norton's going to be there for the Hulk movie.  Really?  I heard Robert Downey Jr. is going to be there for Iron Man. 
[02:55:00]  Iron Man, yeah.  And the entire cast of Hellboy 2.  Who's in Hellboy 2?  Very nice.  Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, a few others.  Maybe I'll ask you when I talk to them.  Jesus, half these guys can kill us.  I feel like fucking Wonderama now.  This is wonderful.  Hey, could you move the bleachers closer?  A little closer?  I feel like I'm driving a bus.  Jimmy's the bus driver.  What fucking creepy is that? 
[02:55:30]  Hey, sir, on the end, do you lift weights?  Once in a while, yeah.  Once in a while?  Jesus.  Jesus, my mother of God.  Don't kill us.  Oh, wow.  Stan, could you fucking mic them?  I'm trying.  I meant the one guy.  Okay.  All right, wow.  All right, I'm here.  Hold on.  Why is everybody here today?  We never get an audience this big.  Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  Oh, good, ladies.  I like that.  I like women.  No, people are flying in from all over the country to see Norton at Caroline's.  Oh, boy, they're going to be disappointed.  MSNBC just had news footage of the earthquake. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  Because the news was on when the earthquake happened, and they were talking.  Okay.  So if we could get, like, what stupid news people sound like when their studio starts shaking.  Hey, where's everybody from?  Texas.  New Hampshire.  Texas, New Hampshire.  Or Chicago.  Just blurt out every state of the union.  It's a good system.  I got it.  No, but I got them all.  Wait, you're from Texas, the big guy?  Houston, Texas, yeah.  Houston.  What are you doing in town?  I'm here for New York Comic Con.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm a geek.  I'm a nerd.  The fucking Hulk.  So you're just here to kind of check out Comic Con? 
[02:56:30]  Absolutely.  Who do you want to meet the most?  I'm not here to meet people.  I have a lot of friends here, so I'm just going to hang out with them.  Are you a comic book reader?  Not too much, no.  No?  I'm not fucking with you.  No, you're not.  No, sir.  It's not my thing.  I just...  Oh, he's a big dude.  Yeah, you're too big to fuck with, man.  You're sick, too.  Like, he's a big...  He's not, like, weightlifting big.  That guy's a problem.  He's fucking...  He takes, like, beer can-sized shits.  He's a fucking major problem.  And from Texas, so...  Yeah, he's a problem.  Yeah, absolutely.  Who else we got? 
[02:57:00]  Anybody else want to speak?  How about the guy...  Let's just go in order here.  Pat, you backed all the way up.  How about this young fucking George Harrison?  How are you?  Hi.  Actually, I thought more, I don't know, Serpico.  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah, Serpico.  I got Serpico over there.  I'm just hoping Harrison brain cancer jokes would fly.  Okay, Puddin' Head, where you from?  Exactly.  About five blocks away.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's it?  Cool.  Did you fly in?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, no.  That's why they pay me. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  How about you?  I'm out of Chicago.  Where'd you get the shirt?  What's the shirt?  From your website.  Oh, really?  He's wearing the swingers is the name of the baseball team in Grand Theft Auto IV.  And he's got one on.  He's got one of the t-shirts on.  I'm a big fan of his stuff, so.  Thanks.  Thank you very much.  Bless, little fan.  Can you buy the merchandise, please?  Yeah, I will.  Buy merch.  Madam?  I'm also from Chicago.  I paid for my son to come into Comic-Con.  That's your son?  That's your son?  Now everybody else the same thing.  What?  You could be his sister. 
[02:58:00]  No way, man.  And I wasn't a teenager, either.  No?  No.  So what is mom going to do all the sons at Comic-Con?  You couldn't enjoy Comic-Con?  Sometimes I'll be saving a place in line for him.  What a good mom.  There's always a line at Comic-Con.  And actually, next week, we're seeing you in Chicago.  Oh, good.  Yeah, we're really excited about that.  Funny thing, because both shows are sold out.  There's been like 20 tickets added, because my comps, I don't use all my comps.  They give me like 20 a show.  So I've released like 10 tickets a show.  Ain't you something?  Yeah, you know, just a real mensch. 
[02:58:30]  We saw you on the street last night going to Caroline's, but you seemed to...  That was a girl.  She was holding a Jimmy Dean sausage in front of her.  Sausage.  Sausage.  But you seemed so in the zone.  It was like, oh my God, we don't want to bother him.  No, you could have.  I was just tired.  You read that wrong.  He was obsessing about something.  Yeah, it probably was.  Okay.  It had nothing to do with getting ready for the show.  I meant it, but I didn't want to disturb you.  You seemed on your way to work. 
[02:59:00]  I'm easy.  Was I with Kenny?  No, you were by yourself.  Okay, probably just because Kenny was parking the truck.  Okay.  Yeah.  He does that.  Hi, fella.  What's going on?  How are you?  Good.  From Jersey, and I'm here for you guys and Comic-Con.  Cool.  What are you going to see at Comic-Con that you like?  Uh, I'm looking forward to the X-Files thing and the Battlestar Galactica stuff.  Hey, did you like our X-Files interview?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're pretty bad.  Would you have asked different questions?  What would you have asked?  Actually, no.  No, I really wouldn't have asked any questions.  Thank you.  All right.  But at the end, I really hated the show. 
[02:59:30]  That was great.  At the end, really, too.  Horrible.  Sucked.  You sucked a bag of dicks.  We also have Laszlo in studio.  We're going to get back to the audience in a second.  We're taking a look at Grand Theft Auto 4.  Another observation.  Wow.  It's raining in this scene, and the rain looks so real.  Yeah, the rain's amazing.  What's even better is when you listen to the radio, and they'll come on with a weather  report, and they'll say, expect some rain this afternoon.  When it hits the afternoon in the game, it'll start to rain.  It starts raining?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look at how real the rain looks. 
[03:00:00]  That's pretty good.  You guys, for some reason, aren't allowed to see it, because then you might sneak a picture  and then wreck Laszlo's whole gig.  Can the big Grand Theft Auto just take a peek with you?  Let him take a peek.  Let him take a peek.  Since he's been buying.  He's like the pool reporter guy.  Then you can go back and report to the rest of them.  Go farther back towards that wall.  You've got to get to the Bob Kelly audio, though, at some point.  Oh, yeah.  Where's that audio?  When Bob Kelly was in the studio, I didn't direct him, but I was handing him off to one  of my fellow directors, at which point, I believe I mentioned he pulled his pants 
[03:00:30]  down and was trying to stick his ass up against the glass of the studio booth.  But he was in there with this other director, and the stuff that he was saying about his  acting, because I never really thought Bob was an actor.  He was in a couple of movies, wasn't he?  Yes, Orca.  Hey, there's a fight scene going on now, too.  The punching is a lot more realistic, too.  Yeah, we hired some legitimate fighters. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, kicking the balls?  Oh, really?  And had them get in motion capture suits and do all that.  There's a lot more hand-to-hand combat in this game.  You can kick.  This is a drastic upgrade, because Grand Theft Auto, every time one came out, it definitely  was upgrading.  But this is a huge jump from the last one.  Yeah, for Grand Theft Auto 4, our policy has always been to double the amount of stuff  that we put in.  Like, there's twice as much.  In this game, there's like 18 radio stations.  Wow.  We had like 9 or 10 before. 
[03:01:30]  How many in the first one?  One.  Really?  Yeah, it just played the hits.  What do you think of the game, sir?  It looks amazing, yeah.  Did you see the big difference between four as opposed to three?  The lighting's amazing.  The headlights and taillights on the vehicles.  Just the dynamic lighting or the sun coming over and through the bridge looks amazing.  And the cell phone is cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, you do a lot through the cell phone.  You can actually, if you're just playing some missions and you want to do multiplayer, 
[03:02:00]  you just pop open your cell phone and that'll throw you right into multiplayer mode.  Really?  Because you know one of the things that sort of bugs me about Call of Duty 4 is how you  have to sort of like exit out and load a whole new game or whatever.  This is seamless.  He has a bat.  Sorry.  Oh, yes.  Just crack his head open.  Crack his fucking head open.  Can you carry that bat the whole game in the strip club?  Oh, yeah.  You can beat strippers with the bat.  Oh, how fucking great is that bat?  Yeah.  He's running into the projects.  This is fucking great. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  You know, if you walk around the sort of Bronx section of the game, it looks distinctly  different than the Brooklyn section.  Does it?  Yes, it does.  Ethnicities, language.  Really?  And the guys at Rockstar North came over and went through the city and took pictures of  everything.  So every deli sign that you see, you know, the windows of shops, all look very New York.  Wow.  The level of detail is beyond insane. 
[03:03:00]  Even when you go through Chinatown, the signs in Chinese, that's legitimate Chinese.  But some of the statements may be...  Oh, shit, really?  Yeah, we try to hide a lot of stuff in this game so that, you know, people are constantly  discovering...  Oh, bad guy.  Bad guy around the corner.  I have to get this.  There we go.  Oh, look.  You didn't get him.  How'd you miss?  Oh, he's got...  He's shooting with one hand, taking cover.  Goddamn.  That's pretty cool.  Tactic.  And you got shot, didn't you?  Oh!  Nice shot.  Blood mist.  Oh, misted the guy's head right against the wall. 
[03:03:30]  All right, listen.  We got Jimmy asking Chris Carter...  Fantastic.  Pretty much actor questions.  We got two of these.  Oh, good.  We're going to get back to you in a second.  We got more audio from the game and Anthony's jingle unedited.  Yeah, you got to definitely hear it.  All the clips we're going to play over here, you know, we couldn't play over there because  of censorship.  This is intern Tony's bit, which is a douche chill theater right now because...  We're playing douche chill theater with Jim Norm.  This is...  We had Chris Carter and the other dude. 
[03:04:00]  The other dude, creator dude.  Yeah, two...  Well, Chris Carter...  Frank Spotness.  He was the director of X-Files and Chris Carter was the creator.  See, all right.  Yeah, but you don't want the actors because the creators can always kind of...  Maybe they were responding badly because it was so obvious that Jim...  Jim thought they were the actors.  I can't tell you how many instant feedbacks came in and they wrote, their movie should 
[03:04:30]  be called The Z-Files.  I just...  Oh, damn.  We just didn't want to blow up their spot.  Whatever.  Here's Norton asking acting questions, I believe, to the creator and the director of  The X-Files.  Hey, um, do you guys...  Like, when you're in between, like, you know, you got six years between doing films, are  you doing, like, theater and stuff like that?  A lot of actors just do...  A lot of actors do theater.  They just want to go out and...  Like, you know, Gandalfini always wants to go out and do some other thing.  I mean... 
[03:05:00]  Right.  That's the end.  Mike.  Wow.  I didn't hear...  I didn't know that you...  You said actors.  I love the guy who wants to go...  Actors.  Right.  Right.  We're not actors, stupid.  Yeah.  You should have said that to me.  I would have fucking laughed.  Yeah, I know.  You made me a nice way.  I think we have one more example.  Oh, good.  Here we go.  Jillian was 24 when she started the series.  Jeez.  Yeah.  Wow.  How many years were you on?  Nine years.  Okay, so she's...  Oh, she's...  Jesus. 
[03:05:30]  That's not that bad.  That's not bad at all.  That's just...  It was about age.  There was one where I was talking about Pacino or something.  Yeah, I talked about Joe Pesci, or as my mother would say, Joe Pesci.  Joe Pesci.  Yeah, you had another actor question.  At least one more in there that kind of was like, hmm.  They're looking...  Yeah, the typecasting.  They're looking for it.  Yeah, they're fine.  Oh, typecasting.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the good one.  Are you typecast as a creator?  Hey, God has been.  Hey, Laszlo, why don't we set up some more of these clips?  I don't have a cue sheet in front of me, so what do we got? 
[03:06:00]  Cue.  Just do all the ones that aren't highlighted stuff from the top.  Yeah, number five is if you go up to Opie's character in the game, and actually, cops will  come up and fuck with you in this game, and there's always responses, so cops will go  up to random peds on the street and bother him, and if a cop goes and bothers Opie's character,  this is what he says.  Fuck you.  Do I know Keith, the cop?  That's a good one. 
[03:06:30]  God damn, all the show references.  That's a good one.  Half the world won't even know what this shit really means.  That's cool, man.  And also, Anthony, if you pull a gun on Anthony, track nine, is this.  Yeah, you ought to put that tiny shit back in your pants where it belongs.  And then we get on to the Bob Kelly stuff.  Okay.  He flubbed so many lines during the session.  Of course he did.  Most sessions are normally like an hour, hour and a half.  He flabbed his body and flubbed his lines? 
[03:07:00]  I thought it should have gotten more.  It was a long.  I agree.  Okay, thank you.  It was just hurtful and true.  Yeah.  So track 12.  Okay.  Ray got her to get his friend.  I'm sorry.  Ray got her to get her friend to steal the ice of some club.  I'm fucking enough.  Wait a second.  Yeah, I got you.  My mouth just got wet.  My mouth just got wet.  People are saying that last Norton clip was bad because he asked how long was he on. 
[03:07:30]  He's a fucking creator.  So he's been on the entire project.  When I said how long were you on, I did mean the show.  Okay.  Meaning the X-Files.  Like how long X-Files was on.  Yeah, not like how long were you personally on.  I was hoping you were wrong.  Oh, well.  No.  Is Bob Kelly arguing about, or rather bragging about his acting?  No, it isn't exhausting.  I'm just trying to, because I got to remember just to keep my shit up.  But like my acting ability, my Meisner technique tells me against this.  So it's fighting everything I've learned.  Oh, no. 
[03:08:00]  He was serious.  I think he was serious when he said that.  Meisner?  What is that?  What is that anyway?  I guarantee that dumb fuck doesn't know Meisner's first name.  No.  Meisner.  All right.  Another one?  Douche.  So then he stops in the middle of the session, concerned if he's any good.  What track is that?  I love it.  That's 14.  14.  Okay.  Did you tell him no?  Let's scale from 1 to 10.  What am I, like a 5?  Am I doing all right?  Is it okay?  All right.  I really do.  I did voiceovers for a little while. 
[03:08:30]  They just were fucking around auditions.  And it's usually just failed actors and failed comedians.  You're both.  Good.  He fits right in.  Oh, and then finally, I guess at some point Bob Kelly has sex in the game.  Really?  Yes.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  I don't make any noise when I come.  I just thought not to show any feelings.  Oh. 
[03:09:00]  Exactly.  Dead silence from the audience.  You know, Bob's trying to be, like, introspective and a little self-deprecating.  Yeah.  I don't make noise.  Like, why does the director in the studio need to know that?  I don't make noise when I go.  Oh, I was just wondering that.  That's it.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Does he get a dude in the game?  I think there may have been a dude.  Oh, I could.  Dude!  Do we have Anthony's jingle uncensored?  And when we wrote this, when we wrote this, I spoke with Anthony the next day, and I was 
[03:09:30]  after the session with Anthony, I was walking to get some lunch, and I was singing the lyrics  to this song, which to start off with, last night I think I shit the bed, got so drunk  I gave a dude head.  Yeah, you kind of, you kind of get into it a little bit.  It's a little catchy.  Here it is, Anthony.  It's a Swiss or beer.  Yep.  Last night I think I shit the bed, got so drunk I gave a dude head. 
[03:10:00]  Life is just a merciful blur, when you pop a piss-wasta.  Piss-wasta, don't drink it slow.  3 a.m.  Buy some flow.  Sleep in the bathroom on the floor.  What really matters anymore?  All the crap you do, all day, who fucking cares?  Anyway, piss-wasta, this is beer, drop drunk off a beer, piss-wasta, drink all day, it 
[03:10:30]  helps your troubles go away, yeah, yeah.  Piss-wasta, cheap German lager for export only.  Nice.  That's great.  Piss-wasta.  Oh, yes.  Thank you.  I couldn't have done it without Laszlo.  It's just so amazing how you get up on your toes and he cups the other side of the mic.  I was Bruce Springsteen-ing it.  I was making love to it.  I was. 
[03:11:00]  I will say, once you get the game, there's some other bits of Anthony singing in there,  too.  A little bit?  There's some other bits.  I didn't bring them all, because I didn't want to be a little surprised.  Yeah, you want to save something for the audience.  And what about the, I won't say what it is, but the helicopter news reporter guy?  Oh, yep.  That made it in.  I like that line.  Anthony did some spoofing of news reporters in there.  Yes.  You're going to be the star of the game, I'm thinking.  Yeah, I'm trying.  There's also, there's news reports, as you play the game, there's radio news reports. 
[03:11:30]  So you go blow up a warehouse or whatever, and you're driving away, like the 1010 winds  or whatever will pop in and say there's just been an explosion at this warehouse and so forth.  So as you play the game, the news reports on you, and also when you're driving through  the Times Square of the game, that zipper, the news ticker that we have in Times Square  here, you'll see news items pop up on that, of things that you've, melee things that you've  done in the game.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  It's very immersive.  I can't wait.  When do we get our copy?  Today?  Really?  No.  Come on.  Actually, I'm going to be in London when it comes out.  They're doing some big midnight thing over there for, you know, Monday at midnight, because  it comes out on April 29th on Tuesday.  They get it first?  Well, they are in the future.  Motherfuckers!  Come on!  But that isn't even fair.  You can't give it to the future first.  I have one of the courier producer people who's going to come and personally hand it to  you guys the morning that comes out. 
[03:12:30]  Oh!  Nice.  Hey, Jimmy.  I like that.  You want to play the game?  You've never played Grand Theft Auto.  Oh, I'm a little nervous.  Would you like to play in front of everybody?  Give him a quick thing on how to beat someone over the head with a bat.  Laszlo, explain what Jimmy's going to attempt to do here.  Jimmy, right now, Nico is the character that you play, the gentleman from Eastern Europe  who shows up on the shores of Liberty City.  Right now, Jimmy's got him standing, looks like, near Times Square, the game which we call 
[03:13:00]  Star Junction.  He's instantly, I think, he's got a gun out.  He already has a gun out.  He's already, he's just pointing at pedestrians who are not running away.  And they're running away because they don't know how to shoot them.  Putting their hands up.  You're not shooting.  Die.  He's targeting people and they're running away but he doesn't know how to shoot them.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh.  How do I run after him?  You just shot a...  Oh, he's getting up.  He's getting up.  No, he's not.  Jimmy's killing people.  Right in the fucking mouth I shot him. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, well.  This is a dangerous game for Jimmy.  Jimmy's just fucking shooting.  How do I run faster?  This guy's slow.  Press A.  Oh, God.  Press or tap the A button.  What's A mean?  It means walk.  A is the button.  Tap it.  I'm just...  Oh, there he goes.  All right, there you go.  Jimmy's getting the hang out of...  He likes to run in circles.  Running in like...  Why don't you give him the rocket launcher, Sean?  I think he would probably...  Oh, hold on.  Excuse me.  Oh, he's going to run.  Oh, wait.  No, no.  Where am I going?  Fuck.  How do I target him? 
[03:14:00]  There you go.  There you go.  Fuck you.  Oh, he just nailed two people.  Wasting people.  I'm out of bullets.  Oh, you reload.  I'm out of bullets.  See, we've got a special dev kit version of it, so he just hits a button on the keyboard over  there and...  Oh, can you make him skip?  Oh, he's ducking for no reason.  I'm just ducking in the middle of the street.  He's just crouching.  You can't walk around New York like that.  There'll be too much suspicion on you.  How do I uncrouch?  I'm just crouching.  Man, perpetually... 
[03:14:30]  Oh, he's just...  He looks like you're taking a shit.  You're screaming at me.  All right.  He's got the rocket launcher.  All right.  No, I have a bat.  No, you got a bat.  Get him the rocket launcher.  Yeah, give him the rocket launcher.  Cycling through that, using that button.  Yeah.  What is this?  That's a grenade.  That's a grenade.  Oh, look, the cops.  Throw it at the cop car.  How do we give the cops a fucking grenade right in the window?  Hello, officer.  You're a little close.  How do you toss it?  Target?  Target?  What's target?  Same button you were using to target before.  This? 
[03:15:00]  I'm trying not to be conspicuous.  You're out with a grenade.  But you're too close.  You're too close with a grenade.  There you go.  Hold this trigger down.  All right.  All right.  Fuck.  Throw it.  Oh, they're coming after you.  Oh, he threw a grenade right at the cops, and they're ducking.  I just dropped it by my foot.  Oh, the one cop.  Oh, no, you got your ass blown up.  I dropped it by my foot.  I got nervous.  I was playing hot potato.  Jimmy cooked a grenade and literally just dropped it by his feet, and now he's flying. 
[03:15:30]  He flew about 100 feet in the air and just smashed into the crosswalk.  He's dead.  That's a dramatic death right there.  Slow motion.  The guy goes flying in the air and comes down slowly.  When you die in this game, a lot of times it goes into slow mode.  It gets very cinematic.  When he blew the cop car up, one cop went flying about 20 feet in the air and bounced  off a building.  Yeah.  It looked fantastic.  Now he's respawned in front of the emergency room, and he seems to be okay, even though  he's struggling.  Yeah, it's all right.  They fixed him up pretty good. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, sure.  How do I go inside the emergency room?  Can I?  I want you, Jimmy, get in a car.  I want to see how Jimmy handles a car.  All right.  Let's just grab one.  How do I pull a gun out?  Hold on.  We got a carjacker.  Right there.  Grab that Escalade, the truck.  Get that truck.  That one's a pickup.  Press the Y button.  Which one's the Y?  Oh, yellow.  Hi.  Oh, Jimmy's jacking his first car.  All right.  And how do I fucking target him?  You're going to accelerate using the gun.  Wait, can I shoot him?  Now just run people over.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Now go. 
[03:16:30]  I want to see Jimmy run people over.  No, you've got to go forward.  You're backing up.  He's backing up.  It's all the cars.  Where's it going to be this trigger?  Jimmy can't.  And here we go.  All right.  Jimmy's up.  All right.  Now you're over.  Oh, God.  He right turned right into a wall.  The first thing he did.  Hard right.  Dumpster and a wall.  Same trigger.  This trigger here.  Oh, back's up?  Oh, I'm sorry.  All right.  All right.  Jimmy's back.  Suck.  You're hysterical.  I don't know what I'm doing.  No. 
[03:17:00]  Okay, there we go.  You're sideways in the middle of the road.  Oh, I'm fucking busy.  Would you drive?  Oh, he's on the same wall again.  I don't like that fucking building.  Turn the wheel the other way.  All right.  I'm still.  What?  You stick to steer?  He's so patient with me.  Holy shit.  Oh, you're retarded.  Oh, there goes a light pole.  All right.  Move.  All right.  There you go.  Now you're driving.  Jimmy's rocking.  Dead end.  Don't go down that road.  Okay, let's go this way.  No, no, no.  Take a left.  Take a left.  Make a left, yeah.  I don't know.  Jimmy's back. 
[03:17:30]  Come on.  There you go.  All right.  Just push through him.  Fuck him.  This is what it was like with Jimmy's Saturn.  Now, now, oh, Jesus.  Get in the right lane.  Why?  This is great.  Just fucking running into people.  Now run people over.  Oh, there's a cop.  Oh, there goes your hood.  Head on collision with a cop.  Back up, quick.  Oh, people.  Oh, let me get out of there.  Excuse me, officer.  Back up.  Fuck you.  Oh, now he's on the sidewalk running people over.  Oh, right in her.  Big tits.  Oh, let's take a look at her.  No, you can't get him on the stairs.  Hold on.  I fucked up.  Jimmy tried to drive up the stairs.  All right. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, this is so good.  I can't have this game.  All I will do is anything with tits, I'm going to run it over.  Bob Kelly?  I said tits, not dorsal fins.  Oh, excuse me.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, excuse me.  Wow, you were merciful.  No, I wasn't.  I wanted to line up better.  Fuck.  Wow, these people are living.  He's yelling at me for running him over.  He yelled at you.  There you go, brother.  You didn't know. 
[03:18:30]  You just backed up over a guy.  Little bitch.  People tumbling on the sidewalk.  Okay, this is great.  Now the ambulance has shown up.  Oh, really?  Let's go say hello to them.  He ran over the ambulance.  The ambulance guy said, fuck this.  His buddy drove away.  This is fucking.  How do I change camera angles?  There we go.  All right, go for it.  Try to get some speed going, Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy's.  My hood flew off.  There goes your hood.  Daddy, my hat blew off.  Jimmy's got some speed going.  Jimmy's just fishtailing down the street, running everything over. 
[03:19:00]  All right, fuck that.  He's somehow parked in somebody's building, nearly.  This is fucking amazing.  And I think that's the UN behind him.  Oh, good.  That's the UN?  That's where the Pope is right now.  Yes.  This is great, dude.  It's a UN-like building.  All right.  Now, um...  You have to say that?  Everything's a spoof in the game.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to use the real names.  All right, just run people over.  Excuse me?  Fuck.  Pedestrians.  All right, he's knocking light posts down.  I keep hitting the wrong...  Oh, I don't want to get on the subway.  Yeah, don't drive into the subway. 
[03:19:30]  Well, what happens if you do?  You can't get out.  Probably won't fit in a car.  Oh, who's that in the red?  I don't know, but goodbye.  Excuse me, I didn't mean to run you up.  Let's go back.  Uh-huh.  There you go.  Shit.  No!  Oh, my God.  There's just blood all over the street.  Jimmy's backing.  He's going forward and backing over people.  And down the sidewalk.  Fuck, I keep doing this wrong.  Oh!  You just got thrown from the vehicle.  I fucking got thrown out of the vehicle. 
[03:20:00]  He flew through the windshield.  Yeah, he just brushed himself up.  Yeah, he hit a wall and went through the windshield.  And now the gun's out again.  Oh, Jimmy, that was good.  Very entertaining watching Jimmy play that game.  They enjoyed it a little bit.  That is really a fun game, man.  God, I can't have that.  Yeah, that is good.  I'm sorry.  I may have to get Rockstar to get Jimmy an Xbox.  Yeah, huh?  Do you like it?  Get him an Xbox.  God damn, was that fun.  You come in just with your eyes all red, going, ah, I was playing all night. 
[03:20:30]  That's all I would do is just fucking, you haven't even scratched the surface.  Run shit over.  That's not the whole thing?  I mean, that's just like very, very beginner stuff.  Oh, that was great, man.  It gets way crazy.  Hey, we got a brand new promo that Derek put together.  I guess he noticed that we talked to female callers in our, I don't know, unique style.  Yes.  Listen to this.  The Opie and Anthony Show School of Super Professional Broadcasting presents Phone Calls 101.  Talking to a female listener.  Can I talk to you for a second? 
[03:21:00]  You can, darling.  Okay, just try to keep a little quiet and listen to what I'm saying.  I'm just letting you know.  You can't shut up, can you?  No!  Listen, Karen.  Karen, shut the fuck up.  Karen, hold on.  Don't talk.  Don't talk.  Right.  Listen.  Yeah, I'm listening.  No!  When someone says listen, you don't go, I'm listening.  You just listen.  Shut up for a second!  You're not, you don't shut up for a second.  Why don't you shut up?  Shut up! 
[03:21:30]  Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut the fuck up!  Holy shit!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  Shut up!  Is that the CBS side version?  Yeah.  Pretty good job.  I was driving into the city.  I was clenching my teeth during that whole segment.  It was painful.  Dude, it hurt.  I wanted her dead so badly.  That was a rough one.  Hey, earthquake hit, and you asked for the news footage? 
[03:22:00]  Yes, apparently.  Well, the news is on all the time.  Yep.  And it was on in Tennessee when there was this earthquake.  Who wants tickets to Comic-Con?  Whoa!  Whoa!  Nobody moved!  Yeah.  I just threw them at the audience.  All right.  Go ahead, Ann.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, and there was an earthquake, and the news was on, so I guess they, you know what  happens.  They're doing the news.  They're reading the telepromptons or giving the weather.  And all of a sudden, the studio started shaking.  Yeah. 
[03:22:30]  I was wondering what they were saying.  A moderate earthquake surprised the Midwest this morning.  The 5.4 magnitude quake was centered near West Salem, Illinois.  It was felt as far away as Chicago, Cincinnati, and Milwaukee.  There are no reports of injuries or significant damage.  The NBC station in Evansville, Indiana, was live on the air when the ground began to shake.  Uh-oh.  Another warm day in the tri-state, but it sounds like some rain is on the way, Byron.  Yes, we're hearing some shaking here.  It sounds like we have an earthquake here, so I'll have to check that out here. 
[03:23:00]  We're, uh...  I'm just guessing, or maybe we have some...  Well handled.  Have a great weekend.  See you later.  Oh, my God!  If that doesn't sum up the stupid fucking news...  Plays right into our hands, right?  Hey, well, let's have an earthquake here.  We'll see ya.  Wouldn't you do?  Maybe they could cancel whatever's fucking next?  Wouldn't you pop out a character and just start, holy shit?  Yeah, it's the end of the world!  Fire that cameraman, Michael Fox.  He's not gonna work here anymore.  You're getting a groan. 
[03:23:30]  I know.  Jesus.  He spilled my coffee twice this week, too.  And dropped his baby.  I'll keep getting the offer the more you groan.  He wouldn't just spill coffee.  What's that?  He wouldn't just spill coffee.  No, he wouldn't.  Hey, the blender's broken.  Can you hold this for five seconds?  That's right.  Make me a fucking beverage.  Unbelievable.  I didn't think of a beverage.  A daiquiri?  I don't know.  Fucking daiquiri.  Yeah.  Anthony, another home invasion down there in Florida.  Goddamn.  Get your guns.  You guys got guns? 
[03:24:00]  By the way, just bought another one.  I want to say hi to my buddies down there at Coliseum Gun Traders in Uniondale.  I recently went to a local show.  Yeah.  My buddies down there.  Fans of the show.  And that's where I pick up all of my heat.  That's where I get my goods.  Do you get a discount or like a free box of bullets?  Actually, I was throwing a free box of ammo.  Nice.  There after I bought my SIG.  I bought my SIG .45 and then I just bought an HK .40 caliber that Mike, the cop, came 
[03:24:30]  in one day and he goes, check this out.  Check it out, man.  Hold it.  Yeah.  You like that gun, don't you?  And I was like, I went out that day and bought it.  He was like a drug dealer with guns.  They must love you when you walk in.  Oh, they do.  I walk in.  It's like, hey, look who's back.  Even the people at the police station, because the laws are very great here in New York.  To buy a gun, you have to go to the police station.  Only one.  There's only one.  You can't go to anyone.  You've got to go to one in particular where the Pistol License Bureau is. 
[03:25:00]  You've got to get a form that costs you $10 every time in order to purchase a gun.  Then you've got to take the form back to the gun store and buy your gun with the form.  Then within 10 days, you have to bring the gun, the receipt, and the form back to the  police station where they look at the gun, fill out your license with that gun on it.  Amazing.  So you've got to make trips back and forth.  They do anything they can to make it as inconvenient as possible.  So you might save it. 
[03:25:30]  Because if you don't go within 10 days back with the gun, you could lose your license and  everything.  Yeah, you're right.  It should be a lot easier.  Like that guy at Virginia Tech just bought it over the internet.  Illegal gun.  That was an illegal gun.  I'm talking about legal guns.  He makes a good point, though.  No!  They don't ever make good points.  Legal guns are legal guns.  When you buy a gun, and let's say, because there's a problem, and Bloomberg will always  bring this up in New York, that people are buying guns in states where it's easy.  You just show your driver's license, you buy a handgun, and you drive to New York. 
[03:26:00]  And they go, oh, the gun was bought legally.  Yeah, but the second they crossed the fucking state line, it became an illegal gun by somebody  committing a crime by taking it across the state line.  So don't call it a legal fucking gun.  Well, how is it like in Berlin?  Hmm?  I wish like the old days.  Anthony, how many guns do you have now?  Well, wow.  I lost count.  I have a lot.  Maybe that's the next episode of Anthony's Office. 
[03:26:30]  You've only done one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I could maybe run through some of my newer editions.  Double figures, though, at this point?  Yeah.  Over ten?  Yeah.  It's like fucking Easter eggs.  Over ten.  Over ten, including, you know, my rifles, shotguns, and stuff like that.  Pistols, now I'm up to three.  I've had my license a week.  Do you hide them around the house at different places?  No, we were talking about this the other day.  I don't have to hide them around the house because I now wear one of my guns.  He carries.  I carry.  What the fuck?  Thank you, Laszlo.  What are you saying I got some more? 
[03:27:00]  Dude, you broke up with your girlfriend.  You grew this porn star mustache, and you're carrying heat.  What the fuck?  Here's the reasoning behind it.  It's comfortable to wear.  It's not like this big.  Nothing better than having a deadly device strapped next to your nuts.  You know something?  You're right.  It gives you a feeling of security that you don't normally have.  And with the right size gun, which is the HK that I got, 
[03:27:30]  and a nice holster that is very form-fitting, it fits.  It's like having a wallet in your pocket.  You don't notice it.  It's just there.  And then if you need it, it's right there on your hip.  You pull it out, and you're ready for action.  When you go home, do you take off your radio clothes and put on your cowboy clothes?  I don't have a cowboy holster that ties down on my leg.  I have it.  What if someone comes to the door?  Get three guns. 
[03:28:00]  One for each hand, and then hold one in your foot in case they slither under the door.  Who do I look like, the perpetrator?  I didn't say anything.  I said nothing.  That was genius when I just came.  Genius.  It certainly was.  And hang upside down.  Why won't you look through the peephole and see if there's a threat there, and then maybe arm yourself?  What, I live in an apartment?  I got two windows down the side of my fucking ten-foot-high doors. 
[03:28:30]  Look at the window, out the window, and see what the threat level is at.  You look outside the window and get a bullet in your head.  You know what you do?  Cement up the windows.  Right.  So the Jews can't look in.  Dude, you live in a rich neighborhood.  Those are the ones that get the home invasions.  Don't you read the news on Long Island?  He is lost as fuck.  Do you lay in bed and think that you hear Jack Jack's foot, like, there's no more Jack Jack.  I know that's like the ghost of Jack Jack.  That's why I know if there's a noise, he lays in bed. 
[03:29:00]  Pull out the gun.  How many times during the night do you jump up, grab that gun out of the holster, like,  I hear you, motherfucker, and then nobody there?  I don't sleep with it.  I put it on my nightstand.  Oh, Jesus.  Dude, you're going to reach for a bottle of water and blow your brains out one day.  Yeah, because you can mistake a gun for a bottle of water.  You can't as drunk as you are.  Either that, there'll be a home invasion, and I'll throw Perrier.  Yeah, that's right.  They'll break in and you'll be like, thirsty, sir? 
[03:29:30]  No, you keep it on the night table, and then, if need be, it's an arm's reach away, and  blam, blam.  Do you keep one under the seat, like P. Diddy style?  No, no, no, I don't.  Not yet.  Not yet.  That'll be the next stage of this whole thing.  I'll explain something to you.  I adhere to all the rules and regulations and laws that are involved with owning, and responsibilities  that are involved with owning a handgun.  All right, that's good for the air, but let me turn the mics off and let me get you real.  What? 
[03:30:00]  I don't have a trap in my Escalade that I drop the gun in when the popo is behind me.  I'm sorry, you were just saying how you follow all the laws and regulate.  What's the one about discharging a fucking firearm in your basement at a computer?  That was just for the radio.  I did it with CGI, I did it with Adobe After Effects.  That was just one of our fake radio stories.  I put in muzzle flash and a sound effect that I got off the web.  Yeah.  You want to turn the mics off a second?  All right.  They're still on.  Do them. 
[03:30:30]  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Okay, the mics are off.  Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up, Lazlo.  I know those mics are still on, please.  Home invasion.  Let's get to it.  Yes, please.  We got the latest home invasion story, and you're an expert, so tell us what went wrong  here.  All right.  Let me listen and see where I could have...  92...  This one's the 92-year-old man.  Let's see.  What went wrong?  What's he doing invading homes?  Exactly.  Oh, Isaac.  He's replaced the shit. 
[03:31:00]  Here we go.  It's Alzheimer's.  Pants are full.  An elderly man bound to a wheelchair tied up and robbed inside of his own home in Keystone  Heights.  No hope.  Tonight, we're learning more about the terrifying ordeal from the 92-year-old victim himself  and how he managed to free himself and ultimately get help.  CBS 47's Carl Torp has that story live in Clay County.  Good night.  Carl?  Yeah, John.  This 92-year-old man lives alone in Keystone Heights, and police say he was basically overpowered  earlier this month when he's...  Basically overpowered? 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  By what?  A leaf?  Basically.  Overpowered, huh?  Overpowered earlier this month when these two men broke into his home.  Tonight, he's sharing a story.  And a knock came on the door.  92-year-old Burr Robbins also heard yelling.  Hurry.  Oh.  Hurry.  Hurry and open up.  The wheelchair bound.  I heard he swiggy outside.  Hurry and open up.  Hurry.  Hurry.  Wait, his name is...  Wait, who was yelling hurry?  The perpetrators?  Yeah, outside the door. 
[03:32:00]  And he fucking hurried.  And he hurried.  It's chilly out here.  We'd like to rob you quicker.  Oh.  Wheel myself to the door.  What's his name?  Burr?  Hurry and open up.  The wheelchair bound veteran cracked the door to his Keystone Heights home.  The minute that door opened an inch or so...  It was like midnight.  These two characters...  Characters.  ...wimmed their way right on in.  Of course they did, dummy.  They don't...  You're on wheels, too.  You can't even hold the door shut.  They probably just pushed it and he flew backwards.  I don't know if this was easy. 
[03:32:30]  We've got to interrupt this news story.  We've got a big star on the phone.  Kristen Bell, the star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Kristen.  Yes.  Congratulations on the new movie.  Are you excited?  I'm so excited.  Awesome.  All right.  Oh.  So, uh...  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, Roland is in cardiac arrest.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  Best celebrity interview ever.  Ever.  All right.  So, uh, 92-year-old man home...  That was really hard to...  Of course it was.  Uh, this is, uh, more of a story.  Burr says the man tied his hands with electrical tape and demanded his cash and medication.  They ransacked his house from one end to the other. 
[03:33:30]  During this, the elderly man's thoughts turned to his best friend, his 14-year-old Pomeranian named Midnight.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  What the hell?  Useless dog.  Stupid Midnight.  Pomeranians, are they big?  No, they're not.  No, they're little things.  Oh, no.  They're actors from the X-Files, stupid.  Wait, the mom from Illinois knows a little bit?  Excuse me?  You know how big is the dog?  Uh, Pomeranians, they're very tiny.  How much peanut butter do they eat? 
[03:34:00]  Sorry, Sonny.  No, wait.  Do you have to get smaller oven mitts for them?  No.  Awful people.  We're just awful people.  Why can't we ever just be fucking nice for a second?  Oh, she's good.  Yeah, she's good.  How big are they, like, that big?  Are they, like, little poodles?  Uh, much smaller than a poodle. 
[03:34:30]  Okay.  Um, uh, a little bit larger, a bit bigger than a bag of sugar.  That's an odd way to describe anything.  A bag of sugar with legs?  Just a spoon full of Pomeranian?  Pomeranian?  What the fuck?  All right, let's go back.  Let's go see, dog.  I hope one of the burglars kicked it.  Just fucking, just de-ribbed it.  Punted it.  Let's go back to the story here.  Teen-year-old Pomeranian named Midnight.  This whole thing was a very frightening affair. 
[03:35:00]  I was worried to death about my little dog.  Police say the two men took Burr's wallet, pistol, and his car from his garage.  And a pistol?  All tied up, but managed to get a knife.  I finally sawed.  I kept working till I sawed the tape in two.  Then the 92-year-old made it to his scooter.  I don't bother with any clothes.  Out the door I went.  He rode down the ramp.  And across the front lawn to the road out front where Burr tried to do whatever he could to get some attention. 
[03:35:30]  The first person that come by, I'm waving like mad to them.  And they wave back and kept right on going.  Crazy old nude fuck on his scooter.  That's the old Burr cocksucker waving again on his scooter.  They waved back and kept right on going.  Eventually, a driver stopped and called police.  Eventually.  And robbed him.  The only thing that could have made this story better is if a dump truck driver just barreled into Burr. 
[03:36:00]  Now, he had a gun.  Did he really?  Because they said they stole his wallet, a gun, and then he got the knife.  But obviously, he did not have the gun on him.  Right, right.  Which makes you vulnerable.  What?  You want to have it on his wheelchair or something?  Put it right there.  On a wheelchair, sure.  You just put it right next to you.  Yeah.  Guy opens that door.  Blam, blam, blam.  You're slinging lead there.  What do you do? 
[03:36:30]  The old man has a those people comment.  Oh, nice.  Well, he is 92.  This week, police arrested 18-year-old Calvin Thomas.  Calvin Thomas.  Driving Burr's Dodge in Jacksonville.  Police say he's one of the two who robbed the Keystone Heights man.  And tonight, Burr Robbins sleeps easier, but is still filled with questions.  What's the matter with those people that they do something like this?  Well, you know what?  Look, Calvin, we've never seen him.  And like they say, you can't judge a man by his grape Kool-Aid. 
[03:37:00]  But it's still filled with questions.  What's the matter with those people that they do something like this?  Back in my day.  I don't have an answer.  Well, Burr says those two men were in his house for about two hours.  He was not seriously hurt.  Two hours?  They watch a movie?  He's still on the loose tonight.  Two hours?  That's got to suck.  Because after like a half hour, you start going, you guys are going to be much longer? 
[03:37:30]  Like you've got to start asking questions.  Exactly.  What else do you want?  How do you ransack an old guy's house and it takes two hours?  Pomeranians nipping at their heels.  Yeah, the whole time.  Watch out.  He nips.  Why don't we take a quick break and do one of the day and some of the things before we  get out of here?  I've got to head to the airport because of the Pope.  It's going to take me 18 hours.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to Chicago to go be on the big hip-hop power 90-something afternoon drive extravaganza. 
[03:38:00]  Today?  Yeah.  At the black show?  So wait, now you guys are...  Yes.  I'm going to show the Xbox to those people.  Wow.  You're going to think it's home videos.  Oh, shit.  You're going to be focusing on the uptown version of this game.  Yes.  The uptown section of the game.  I showed you guys the...  They showed us midtown.  I showed you up midtown.  I'll be showing them the Bronx.  Oh, look.  This is the avoid child payments challenge. 
[03:38:30]  Wow.  So now you do a radio tour?  You're going to be on just a...  Yeah.  Station after station.  Station after station.  So I wanted to start on a positive note because I know that it's just going to be yuck out there.  It's going to be yuck.  I hope you get beaten and they steal it.  Do you hook up to a TV in their studio?  Yeah.  Plus, we have our own TV that we carry around with us.  But, dude, every one of these shows, like I said on Ron Bennington, every one of these shows,  like, can we have 20 copies to give away?  It's like, no. 
[03:39:00]  Dude, the biggest radio show in the nation doesn't ask me for fucking copies to give away.  That's right.  Rush Limbaugh.  That's not radio.  That's ranting.  Oh, look at that.  Someone's got a bumper sticker idea.  Well, Laszlo, we say goodbye to the audience stays, the Big Kev stays, and we'll finish up next.  April 29th.  Yes, look for it.  Wow, this is radio and it's most fascinating. 
[03:39:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the worst radio I've ever heard.  On and on and on and on and on and on.  It's fucking boring.  It's hard to be a good listener in general, but to try to listen to this,  you better off jerking them up into a napkin and crying yourself to sleep.  Trust me, kid.  Oh, man, we just missed a great moment live on the show.  Oh, they're still laughing, too, man.  We were in break and I was getting scolded by, like, I don't know, 
[03:40:00]  three of the staff because of our great Kristen Bell interview.  And as they're, like, kind of yelling at me, all of a sudden, which was awkward  because we have a lot of people checking out the show today,  so they're staring at me as I'm getting yelled at.  All of a sudden, everyone here is a thud really loud, and we all look up.  And what, was she on the floor?  I don't know.  Watch right into it.  Some people saw it.  Stalker Patty was coming back into the studio because we brought everyone into the actual studio today. 
[03:40:30]  Usually we let you guys hang out out there.  And Patty was trying to come back in the studio and walked right into the glass wall.  Thinking it was an open door.  Yeah, exactly.  Like a fucking stupid sparrow.  And Jimmy comes running in, like, because you heard the noise, right?  I heard a dull thud, and I saw her backing away from the window,  and I'm like, please let this be what happened.  There's a greasy, like, shroud of Turin print up there.  Yes.  That's what I want to see. 
[03:41:00]  Get a picture of that.  Yeah, Catholics are starting to line up.  They think it's the Virgin Mary on our glass now.  Great.  It's the Virgin Patty's face.  It's the Virgin Patty.  That's God damn it.  It's all done with you.  Patty, what happened?  The door must have been less wider than I thought.  Yeah.  You were in the middle of the hall.  You were in the middle of the hall.  Yeah, you weren't near a door.  I did not see the glass.  You're not Tor Johnson.  An idiot would have walked into that glass. 
[03:41:30]  Plus, she's here all the time.  At this point, you should know where the doors are.  Did you go in senile in your old age there, Patty?  No.  Your brain drying up like your womb?  No.  Her womb looks like the room they shot Pesci in in Goodfellas.  Steven asks from Bayshore, did Patty slip in her own yeast infection?  Oh, Patty.  God damn it.  People have to come by this show more often.  You guys are giving us a lot of energy today. 
[03:42:00]  A lot of energy.  That had a hurt.  Patty, what have you been up to?  Walking into walls.  Sweater shopping with Alice Rieger.  Nice fucking Captain Kirk collar on that thing, too.  All right, what, Patty?  We didn't hear you because we were enjoying the laugh of Anthony's joke.  So what have you been up to?  Working very hard, trying to get double shifts in and stuff like that, you know. 
[03:42:30]  Where are you working?  Starbucks.  Still at Starbucks, huh?  Yeah.  I'll be there a long time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know, right when you started working at Starbucks is when they started taking, like,  kind of a dive.  No, we're doing very well.  Good response.  Patty, how come they switched the symbol?  They went back to the old logo.  The owner wanted to go back to the roots, you know, when they first started. 
[03:43:00]  You mean the show?  It's like a reinvention.  Sounds like...  It'll be cheaper labor.  Sounds like a lot of...  Karma mocchiata, chicken George.  That's right.  You're going to cut off half my buns.  I couldn't think of a Starbucks cakey treat.  Fucking shit, I am.  Oh, Patty. 
[03:43:30]  All right, Patty.  You got anything to say?  How's your nose?  Did you hit it with your nose?  No, I hit it with my head.  How do you walk?  I think I got a bruise there.  I'm not even sure.  Thank God you have such low self-esteem, you'll look down when you walk or you're going to  hit your nose.  She's like the Pope.  The old one.  She knows she's awful, too.  Hey, can we show the audience at least...  What?  Can we...  Our favorite video clip ever.  All right, if you guys back up, we'll show you our... 
[03:44:00]  Well, not our.  I'll put it up everywhere.  Everywhere?  Yeah.  The screen's above your head.  And what is this called on YouTube again?  This is called...  This is called...  No, no.  Give the real name out because people are really getting turned on in this video now.  Return your hat?  Remove your hat.  Remove your hat.  Jesus.  I got it wrong.  Remove your hat on YouTube.  She was obviously a very rude older woman.  Yes.  And she didn't know that being indoors with a hat on is impolite.  Yeah.  So Mr. Manners decided to help her.  Remove your hat on YouTube.  I want to see the reaction of the audience.  I'm sure they've all seen it, right? 
[03:44:30]  You guys all...  It's fantastic.  All right.  Watch this fucking...  The woman that has it in the back.  You haven't seen this?  The nerve of this old lady.  This gentleman has to help her.  This gentleman.  This young gentleman.  This young gentleman.  What happened?  Problem?  The remove your hat video starts with a logo for a minute.  So if you want to actually see the goodness, then I have to go to the other one.  Why don't you show the other one?  All right.  We don't need to remove your hat over and over.  Just show the same one. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  You like the original.  Yeah.  Remove your hat.  Remove your hat.  You can check that out on YouTube with commentary.  But here comes brand new commentary today.  I don't even need the commentary.  I just want to...  I want to do the one in the back wasn't seen.  Just watch this rude...  Look at her.  Look at her.  She has a hat on the doors.  There goes the hat.  Oh, oh, oh.  A little jab.  Doesn't she look like the Pope from that angle?  The white hair?  All right.  And now he's kind of frisking her for any goods.  They have a little conversation. 
[03:45:30]  The hair fluff.  And then she mouths off right here.  Oh, yeah.  Whoa!  And down she goes.  Oh, stupid Peter Graves.  Oh, wait.  We should rename this.  Here's your hat.  Now take a nap.  There's a few people that aren't going with it out there.  No, it's funny as hell.  There's a few that are shaking their head.  See, there goes her hat. 
[03:46:00]  Wait, why that?  But look at her interfering and causing a problem.  What's she supposed to do?  Yes.  Maybe the gentleman wants to get to the elevator.  She's in the way.  Yeah.  And remove the hat out of respect.  That fuck, what a good head of hair she has.  Holy shit.  Watch how the hair puffs out when he does it.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  She just topples over.  She's 101.  You know who doesn't like it?  And has a glass jaw.  The big dude from Texas doesn't like it because he's a fucking.  Oh, he's like, I know what I'd like to do to him.  God damn it. 
[03:46:30]  Let me tell you.  I need a chain in a pickup truck.  Oh, what a doodle.  All right, listen.  I believe.  The grease man's on steroids.  Whoa.  Oh, wow.  Do you wish you were there to defend her when that was going on?  Yeah, it's hard for me to watch something like that.  It truly is.  It was for us, too, at first.  But then after a while.  It became hysterical for some reason.  We were very angry when we first saw it.  And then somebody noticed the puff of hair, and it was all downhill. 
[03:47:00]  Well, now that you pointed it out.  You have to watch the full head of hair and the wheel spin.  And the fact that it's a hat removal ceremony.  He's trying to help her.  He's looking for the hat.  He was going to pick it up.  And then she mouthed off.  She's a hat thief.  She called him something right here when she leans forward.  Oh, yeah, because he turned around.  Like, what are you saying?  And then, bam, and I hold the puff.  And look, oh, she can't stand up.  Jimmy, they're not laughing as heartily as we do.  They've seen it already, and we've already done the commentary on it. 
[03:47:30]  See that?  She's a hat thief, so he's the store security guard.  And he's taking back company property.  She took three jabs pretty good, though, for a whole broad.  How bad is he?  He can't knock a 101-year-old man down with fucking a couple of shots.  I know, with three jabs.  He's got to really wind up with a right clocker.  She obviously said something.  Oh.  As he turned around, he was leaving.  Yeah, ouch.  He was leaving with what he had.  Help.  Help.  All right.  Wonderful.  They don't get away with stuff like that in Texas.  All right, we've got one more thing to do before line.  Wow, look at his arms. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, he's a big fella.  What do you lift?  How much do you bench?  My best was 480.  That's all right.  What's your average?  What do you work out with?  Around 405.  Jesus Christ.  That's a fucking highway in L.A. I drive on.  Can you lift, if we set this up nice, can you lift E-Rock for us today?  Probably not, no.  Have you ever lifted a wet bag of feces?  Just don't smell his breath.  It smells worse than that.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Come on, I'm kidding.  E-Rock.  Let's put E-Rock on a board and see if the big dude can lift him. 
[03:48:30]  E-Rock and board.  Yeah, putting E-Rock on a how people feel when they talk to him.  Long way to go.  Sorry, Eric.  I didn't mean to.  Get E-Rock in here because he's not happy today.  I want to find out what's going on with E-Rock.  He is really like in a bad fucking cranky ass mood.  I didn't even notice.  Yeah, he is.  Oh, fucking Fabergé egg hair.  I didn't notice.  Can you go find him?  He's too angry.  Here he comes.  By the way, guys, that's Pat effing effing.  I can say it here.  Pat fucking Duffy. 
[03:49:00]  Getting a rising round of applause for rubbing shit on himself.  Star of many videos on this radio show.  E-Rock, what's up?  Speak your mind.  E-Rock.  Why are you?  Something is bothering you.  Let it out.  What happened?  What's bothering you?  Something's bugging you.  We can tell.  You came in.  You're walking around in a pissy mood.  Well, I asked you and you said, well, it wasn't fun being in the back office.  Yeah.  Why?  What happened?  Someone see it's chapstick again?  No.  Look at the face he makes at you.  That's all right.  I deserve it.  The joke sucked.  It wasn't fun because of having to deal with probably some repercussions from hanging 
[03:49:30]  up on our guest.  E-Rock thinks he has to deal with this stuff.  It wasn't hanging up on the guest.  The interview was done.  Yeah.  We hope he asked a question.  We got the name of the movie.  It got a good answer.  We told him when the movie is.  Yeah.  He said awesome.  It was awesome to work on it.  Yeah.  Interview over.  What was the problem?  And what do you have to deal with with this?  I was working on this with Roland.  You worked on that.  With Roland. 
[03:50:00]  What did you do to work on this with Roland?  I've been learning what Roland does, how he handles things.  Uh-oh.  And Sam's here.  What nonsense.  That translates to he's been watching Roland as Roland works on it.  Oh.  Ah, look at Danny coming in.  Let me throw some fuel.  I got some lighter fluid.  I just want to spray it on this little flame.  I just want to watch.  Just want to watch.  E-Rock, what's wrong today?  Nothing.  I just don't think that was someone's ringtone. 
[03:50:30]  That's all right.  Who's got the ringtone?  My ringtone, Bob Dylan, Highway 61 Revisited.  Wow.  That's all right.  Good song.  Good song.  Would it be more accurate to describe your and Roland's relationship as a mentor and mentee?  That's right.  With body size.  Oh, no.  Travis is here.  Travis.  They all come in for the pile on.  You're watching the pile on.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[03:51:00]  Unbelievable.  Like rats.  Like rats.  What are they laughing at?  Travis has a sign on his back that says, I fart cum.  and that's what the audience saw  it's alright though because he's a girl  Steve and Roland both say  this is the first they've heard of this  oh my god  where's Steve  and Roland 
[03:51:30]  Steve's writing up  one of those signs to put on his back  well if it's true  do the cinnamon challenge for everybody today  what do you say cinnamon challenge  do we have it  say no  Steve what happened  Steve now Iraq says he was helping  Roland this whole time  try to procure that guest  that I'm not aware of  did the interview with  as far as I know Roland handles the guest bookings 
[03:52:00]  solely by himself  yes he does but I've also been  watching him work  and learning what he does  and speaking to the people  that he speaks  what does he do  what did you learn  what have you learned  so far  how you  what kind of questions  ask  dial a phone  yeah I was gonna say  how did you point at something  go what's that  and Roland goes  that's a phone  it's a phone  here's a number  you press the numbers  into the phone  and someone picks up  and you ask  can they come on the show  were you just looking out the window 
[03:52:30]  for celebrities yelling  hey come up  so what did you learn  about when certain guests do come up  with their publicists  and other representation  from either the movie companies  or TV companies  boring  so what did you learn from that  what did you learn to do with that  I learned about keeping contacts  with these people  and  can you sign this  how to stay in touch  keeping relationships open 
[03:53:00]  for the show  and  you know  for when they have future guests  and things like that  no  I'm really not understanding  what you learned  alright so what did you learn  from the Kristen Bell  experience  that we probably  are going to have  a difficult time  with Paramount now  it's not like they're  putting out  big movies  who have we gotten  from Paramount  yeah Steve  who did we get  who have we gotten  from Paramount  that we really enjoyed  oh here comes Roland  Roland  help me out  I think Jack Black  was one of them 
[03:53:30]  when was the last time  we had Jack Black on  yeah  exactly  we had him back  twice  it was fucking  Opie Anthony  and Jack Black  on third mic  but he was a guest Jim  Roland  Roland  now hold on  hold on  before Roland starts  I'll be buying you  dinner this weekend  I think  well  you don't recap  with Anthony  I don't know  why Anthony  would suggest  that we do that  on this show  I don't know  I mean  I just talked  to Kristen  and discussed  what happened  with the phone lines 
[03:54:00]  I hope  with as much  confidence in your  voice as you're  using now  I told her  that Mars  was fixing her  phone lines  and unfortunately  he killed  all the phone lines  oh  good one  so due to that  but no  we're going to  reschedule her  for next week  because she loves  the show  so I told her  I'm sorry  I couldn't transfer you  but her phone lines  keep dumping now  because our tech guy  hit a wire  so you blamed  you're hoping  that flies right  hit a wire  really smart  to explain that  on a national radio show  it's fine 
[03:54:30]  Patty landed  on a transformer  I say it's a Puerto Rican  I just told her  it was Puerto Rican  she goes oh okay  oh wow  Jesus  throw a little racism  into it  now how has  Iraq been helping you  with all these guests  he just asked me  what I do  and I just tell him  do you feel  when you're  in the same room  and you're doing  something  that you're teaching  him things  or he's just asking  you annoying questions  I don't know  I just answer questions 
[03:55:00]  like this one  I just had to focus  and do it myself  because it just was  when the shit hits the fan  you're like  gotta weave things  wait you didn't want  your young squire  here to help out  your young protege  no it's just like  I don't know  he asked me  what I do  and how you handle  the situations  and different things  what'd you tell him  this one  I just  just went  say lie  lie through your teeth  and say that  not like the teeth  it just explains  what happens  during the radio show  when phone lines 
[03:55:30]  crap out  yeah  they really did too  I've gotten no new  information from either one  of these guys  no no  both of them  are just mysteries  something's bugging  Iraq though  and he's not fessing up  with it  what's bugging you  Iraq  you're in a pissy mood  today a little bit  I can see it  I can see it on your face  speak your mind  the other thing  has nothing to do  with the show  what's the other thing  I had a problem  with my car yesterday  so  the angel of death  who did you run over  the car  hold on  before we let 
[03:56:00]  Roland go  Roland now  we'll have to  do a make good  so we'll get that  other guy on our show  next week  what's his name  I don't remember  wow  that's a biggie  oh you don't want to say  cause then  when this guy  is on the show  everyone realizes  that it's a favor to you  oh wow  he's smart  you can't trip him up  this fucker is learning man  yeah  let's trip him up  alright  but you like to call  oh boy  Mars took the blame  Mars what happened  to the phones  yeah Mars  you took the blame  for the phone 
[03:56:30]  going out  with that last guest  what happened  to the phones  fucking  Roland  hung you out to dry  typical  typical Mexican response  oh  cause he said  that fucking up  the phone line  was a typical  Puerto Rican thing  exactly  but they didn't  fuck up  did they  see  oh  see  are you saying  yes  I guess so  oh  alright  wow  I love the diversity  around here  what happened  to Iraq's car  yeah Iraq  car  it died  all the electrical  equipment just 
[03:57:00]  died in the car  so  I was stranded  in a parking lot  for over two hours  the car  the car just got  tired of driving  you around  and quit  quit on you  was  was the tow truck  able to find  the right  McDonald's  no  no  sorry sir  what kind of  parking lot  were you in  it was a  parking lot  at a Best Buy  what are you getting  um  just a bunch  of DVDs  something flat  you should have 
[03:57:30]  gotten something  for your car  alright  we haven't seen you  close to crying  in a long time  what's up  I think we could  get tears  out of you  today  so what is it  uh  maybe  maybe dead  battery  don't be too  sure Ralph  I ain't got  no hairpin  no  great quote  from the  honeymoon  just not  having a car  is a big  pain in the ass  would you mind  we wanted to  get this gentleman  to lift you  and he certainly  can  I don't know  if he wants  to though  I'm not really 
[03:58:00]  crazy about  the idea  no  he didn't  like uh  would you choke  him  old lady  I thought  that would be  kind of a  cool trick  to choke me  no  to lift you  the guy can  lift like 400  he works out  with 405 pounds  that's right  he can probably  almost get you up  so who's uh  who's fixing  your car  it's sitting  there right now  it's still  sitting in the  parking lot  of Best Buy 
[03:58:30]  no I managed  to get it  close to  close to my house  how'd you do that  fuck  I got it  jumped  and then it  died out  as soon as I  got near the  house  so it's just  parked on the  side of the  road  Jared from  Manhattan writes  E-Rock's car  flipped over  when he got  his order of  ribs  nice one  E-Rock  so it's 
[03:59:00]  sitting now  closer to your  house  but still  dead  parked on the  side of the  road  what are your  plans  for the  car  apparently  I was told  that it's a  battery issue  not the  electrical  wiring  so I'm  hiring Pat  Duffy to  come over  and fix  the car  what kind  of friends  do you have  that you have  to pay them  to come help  you  Pat Duffy  wouldn't he  help you  he knows  how to  you need  some money  so I'm  trying to help  him out  how much  you're giving  him  how much 
[03:59:30]  are you  going to  give me  work it  out right  now  how much  is it  worth  Pat Duffy  what do you  think is wrong  with the car  it sounds like a  dead battery  does it  how come then  the car was  jumped  and the battery  wasn't being  charged  how do you  know it's not  an alternator  well because  all the  instrument panels  still light up  when he turns  the key  also maybe  there's gook  on the connector  well that would  tell me that  there's power  hold on  that would  tell me that  there's power  in the battery  if the lights  come on when  he turns the key  well my 
[04:00:00]  my reasoning  was that  the charge  is held  in the alternator  and then  right  no the  charge is held  in the battery  the alternator  charges the battery  right  when you drive  so now  I'd say alternator  dude  he's gonna buy  you a new  fucking battery  and you're gonna  go shit  I need an alternator  it clicks  it just  you turn it  and it just  keeps clicking  and then nothing  battery would be  dead  two tires  but if it  starts with a  jump  and runs 
[04:00:30]  for a little  while  just the one  I haven't  jumped it  since  I just  left it  there  yeah but  if it  starts with  a jump  and you're  able to  drive it  a little  while  it's got  the power  and the  battery  from the  jump  but then  that doesn't  replenish  because  I think  your alternator  is bad  great  why don't you  hire Anthony  instead  yeah  how much  you got  six million  come over  how much  are you gonna  give  yeah how much  Pat Duffy  how much  Pat Duffy  come over  and replace  something you  don't need  to replace  maybe he'll  paint it for 
[04:01:00]  you  then it will  vroom home  it could  be a bad  battery  that isn't  taking a  charge  but I don't  know if it  would then  take a charge  from a jump  anyway  we'll see  yeah we'll  see  how much  how much  do you want  how much  is it worth  to you  whatever he  feels like  giving me  I'm not  gonna name  a price  fucking  blowjob  hooker  what do  you got  two bucks  man I  would suck  your dick  you want  a hamburger  50 bucks  yeah I don't  care  50 sound 
[04:01:30]  fair  that's fine  wow  Iraq feels  like he  got you  cheap  you should  have started  a hundred  yeah cause  you said  50 bucks  is that okay  yep fine  what about  expenses that  you incur  and stuff  like that  oh yeah I  said I'd  cover them  on that  too  materials  you know  obviously  I'm gonna  buy everything  and I'm also  gonna pay  for his train  and everything  else I'm covering  them all today  where's this train  coming from  well actually  Eric you live  like 20 minutes  away from me  so I was  gonna ask you  for a ride 
[04:02:00]  home  alright then  I'll do that  how funny  would it be  the car  didn't work  still  yeah no  but you still  couldn't fix it  and he had to  pay for a cab  for you  like on top  of his own  shitty car  back to the  train  and battery  that he didn't  need  he doesn't  throw him  camp you  home  and then  walk himself  you don't  have an  empty tank  do you  no  it's full  he's out of  gas  does it run  on garlic  butter saw  alternate fuel  for E-Rock's  car  nothing  alright  hey thanks  that was  exciting 
[04:02:30]  that was good  I like the  back and forth  there  where they  were  bargaining  a lot of  people say  in your right  hand  it's gonna  be the  alternator  yeah  that's what  I think  uh  Jimmy  you wanna  give out  one ticket  just one  to Caroline's  tonight  um  just one  I'm forcing  the person  they go with  to buy  the other  ticket  um  will you guys  all have  tickets  I do  are you gonna  be at  Comic Con  or are you gonna  be at  Comic Con  I'll go to  your thing  oh okay  where are you  from sir  Jersey

[04:06:30]  the interview  Colby gave  earlier was  longer  and more  in depth  poor  Cam  just trying  to do  the right  thing  I know  all right  we'll sneak  one more  in  we got  hoaxers  mailing  letters  informing  people  they have  STDs  those wacky  hoaxers  let's see  what this  is all  Jimmy  would just  be like  yeah  I know  what two  city residents  found here  was worse  than a bill  much worse  a letter 
[04:07:00]  from the  health  department  informing  them  that they  had a  sexually  transmitted  disease  but  it is  a hoax  here to  be on  health  department  letterhead  notifying  them that  they could  have been  exposed to  an STD  and so  we just  want to  be certainly  aware that  these are  not from  the health  department  in fact  the letter  is riddled  with misspellings  and errors  using terms  like certified  public health  agent  do you have  a certified  public health  agent  no  that's not  even a phrase  you would  use  no  obviously  they knew 
[04:07:30]  it was  fake  you had to  ask her  that  not a phrase  you would  use  and they  fucked up  because they  made the  health department  from AIDS  roads  I knew  that would  get nothing  please tell me  it'll get  something  I was hoping  the audience  had left  no they're  still there  I was hoping  there's no one  here to enjoy  that  there's another  track but  why bother  line of the

[04:15:30]  I just want to tell a quick  story about Jim's book  last summer  oh  look at that  who are you sir  did I see you last night  oh yeah  I did tell him to tell it  I saw him in Caroline  what's your name sir  Mark  and where are you from  Wachill  upstate  sure  oh there's a prison up there  yep  a bad one right  where's that near  it's like 20 minutes  from Poughkeepsie  yeah there you go  okay  you got a story  about Jim's book  so last summer  I'm in the hospital  getting a little operation  what kind of operation  I had a lung removed  get ready 
[04:16:00]  he was from cancer  oh my god  see now you made  everyone a compliment  you had lung cancer  no  just  cancer on the lung  yeah  on the outside  what's the difference  lung cancer  is it different  he's alive  I'm actually a scientist  I do research  on cancer  so there's a difference  what is the difference  when metastasizes  into the lung  you're done  you're done  because it just spreads  when it's on the outside  of the lung  it's the primary tumor  I hear the sign  of getting that 
[04:16:30]  is when you hear  Opie's voice say  good luck bro  so wait  was yours a precursor  to lung cancer  or they just caught it  as it was hanging out  outside the lungs  trying to sneak  from radiation  I had 20 years ago  for a different cancer  oh I thought  from an atomic bomb  exactly  I don't like that joke  that was a good one  no one got it  well  yeah okay Jimmy  thanks  good joke  wow that's  you alright now though  why did they  they had to take 
[04:17:00]  the whole lung  they couldn't like  just cut it out  well yeah  there's some other  things I had to  move around in there  Jesus Christ  alright  so anyway  I'm laying in the hospital  somebody brings  Jimmy's book  so I have it laying  on that table  you know that  stupid table  up and down  you get your lunch  on it  sure  and all these doctors  are coming in  all these intern doctors  from all over the place  and it's just his  book there  and people looking at it  like what the hell  is that thing  with his awful look  on their face 
[04:17:30]  when did it spread  to the brain  I was getting that  I'm teasing of course  sir  we're just making light  of a horrible disease  you know people  would come in and visit  and I go just open  that book and read  one chapter out loud  that's all you got to do  and people could go  like three sentences  and they were embarrassed  to say it  it was just really  kind of fun for me  so two weeks  your book's laying there  and people are  they removed the tumor  and his funny bones  wait a minute 
[04:18:00]  that wasn't bad  okay  you know the story  sounded really good  in my head  bravo sir  bravo  but actually  I don't understand  exactly  it was on the  Jimmy  I'm serious  Jimmy  no you're not  it was on the table  and they read aloud  or they read it  to themselves  each breath is precious  sir  don't waste it on  any more about  the god damn book  wait  it wouldn't make any sense  if they read it 
[04:18:30]  to themselves  were they able to read it  some of them  I got it  that was a good story  god if I could make  13 episodes out of that  we'd have a show  here is a runner up  line of the day  thank you sir  see because I'm  recently single  and I enjoy the  company of younger  women  so if I just say  44 if it doesn't  sound like 46  wow are you really  Jesus  I just threw a 
[04:19:00]  number out there  it's nice  you got 40 years  on her  Jim Norton  Caroline's  sold out right  Jimmy  oh not Sunday  he's not  not Sunday  no  bring a friend  kick your feet up  on the chair  in front of you  but no curtain  right  I don't know  I may have a curtain  Sunday  no you won't have a curtain  I hope no curtain  that is so inside  I hate the curtain  I hate the curtain  rich ross 
[04:19:30]  oh god  I was gonna say  they call it  it's a joke for  five people  that's wonderful  here's another  runner up line  of the day  like a person  we get it  does he have to  go upstairs  and outside  to wave around  that thing of  incense  because I know  you can't smoke  in the building  because you're out  there with people  that are smoking  waving the incense  imagine that  they're just  BSing with the  Pope  and he's waving  that golden thing  with the incense  in it  I don't know  what happened  I haven't screwed 
[04:20:00]  up the beep  whatcha  talk to me  I don't know  bad edit I guess  Sam's edit  they're blaming Sam  Sam fucked that up  I guess there was  what happened  they really need to  get listened to  before they get  put on the air  I just cut them  they need to get  listened to  by the person  who edits them  Sam never takes  the blame  for anything  because I just  cut them  there's a whole  bunch of lines  that didn't make it  and you know why  because Travis  listens to every 
[04:20:30]  single one  I need to be  Sam you're  you're telling me  that that you  shouldn't even  edit them  because I have  to listen to  your work  no but I really  should be informed  of a poor edit  I would hope  that a producer  would do that  in the future  I would hope  a producer knows  what a poor edit  is  before making one  I know  but oversights happen  and I really  need to be informed  if they do  oversights  not a mistake  oversights  it's every fucking  day you're  edits suck  oh wow  now this is  getting personal  well then again  I feel like 
[04:21:00]  somebody should  have told  I don't know  why this is  coming up now  I mean you  should really  say Sam  you need to  do that edit  a little better  as my superior  I would hope  that would come up  when  we have told you  we have told you  that your edits  need to be better  who's told me  not you  both me and  Than  never  not once  at all  whatever  now that it's  documented  oh wow  we got him  whatever  no I'm not  going to argue  with Sam  because it's  just sarcastic  comment  after sarcastic  comment  well Travis  he's implying  that you  never told him  why not argue 
[04:21:30]  with me  shit  the staff  hates each other  it's great  I did not know  that these two  had a problem  though  I'm aware  of a lot  of the problems  between staff  members  but I didn't  realize  this goes deeper  than a dumb edit  sure it doesn't  no it really  doesn't but  it's just like  take responsibility  for something  you know  like  I would agree  it's like 
[04:22:00]  arguing with  a 12 year old  so what are  you going to do  you got beaten  by a 12 year old  no I said  it's like  arguing with  a 12 year old  and I said  you got beaten  by a 12 year old  implying that  I just beat you  in the argument  so Travis  you don't like  Sam's work  is what you're  saying  that's what  I'm saying  and Sam  I wish I had  known ahead of  time because  I would have  changed it  you barely  listen to your  edits  as do you  I want to  kiss more guys  it doesn't have  to do with  the freaking  disagreement  you're having  Sam  I didn't say  that 
[04:22:30]  that was  a pre-recorded  clip  no it's not  we have a  studio audience  you can't say  that  there's no reason  to blurt that out  fuck  I didn't say  that  try to change  the subject  so Sam  you're saying  that your  editing may have  been shoddy  sure yeah  I mean  mistakes  oversights  they happen  every day  but basically  you're saying  that the fail  safe that's in  place  didn't do  his job  yeah  Travis  so Sam  what are you  saying  that I want  to kiss more  guys  Sam 
[04:23:00]  wow  I thought we  were talking  about something  else  I really  this is like  arguing with  a 12 year  old  we're just  playing clips  and stuff  this has  nothing to do  with what  we're talking  about  Sam  if you're  not making  the edits  right  what are you  thinking about  that I want  to kiss more  guys  that was not  live  Sam  you gotta  stop  I'm not  saying it  live  I want  to kiss  more  guys  that wasn't  me  I don't  like  yeah  well it's  because  something was  taken out of  context or 
[04:23:30]  edited  and I don't  know where it  came from  but I'm not  saying it now  that I want  to kiss  more  guys  I love the  fact that  Travis has  these arguing  has his arms  folded  of course he  does  he's all  just  that's just  how I stand  you're very  flustered  why are you  frustrated  when do we  get to blame  Erock for  this whole  thing  oh we can  do that  right now  yeah  Eric used  to cut  the lines  but we  kind of  relieved him  of those  duties  does Sam's  editing  typically  stink  Sam usually 
[04:24:00]  has shoddy  editing  yes  good word  yeah I  had no idea  until now  but in the  future they'll  be better  I promise  the future  so Travis  Sam is saying  that you didn't  inform him  properly  well now  he's being  informed in  front of a  lot of  people that  maybe he  should listen  to his  ins and  outs instead  of just  hitting one  and hitting  another and  cutting it and  saying that's  good  it's true I  feel silly  oh my god 
[04:24:30]  he is the  worst  Sam comment  I want to  kiss more  guys  Sam stop  could you  just let me  talk  stop talking  about dudes  for one second  Jesus Christ  what is this  the Ron and  Fez show  I just saw  that Stan  and Sam  magic  yeah  that chemistry  I've been up  since four  what do you  watch  we all have  that give  and take  what do you  think  are you going  to trust your  partner there 
[04:25:00]  um  what  Travis  no  that's a  revamp  we're doing  no there's  been some  questionable  edits and  it's just  it's a time  sensitive  thing so  here's the end  of the thing  in the same  show  right here  so  what I'm  saying is  you're fired  oh  no  hey can't  we  I gotta  hit the road  before this  old cocksucker  gets out of  this fucking  oh yeah  yeah  alright  very disrespectful  way  we're gonna 
[04:25:30]  be keeping  an eye  on you too  mention him  oh  oh  wow  Steve  let's do  figure out  who I was  talking about  somebody else  said it  they could  have said  me  let's do  another  runner-up  line of the  day  maybe this  one will  sound a  little  better  Sam  thanks  and I'm  pretty sure  you can  chase down  Bob Kelly  and kill  him  oh  what a  treat  really  what do you  hop on a  glacier  and it  catches him  that's a good  edit  for a bad  joke
