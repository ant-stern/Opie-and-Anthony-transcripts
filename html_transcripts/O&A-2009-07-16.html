<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the anniversaries of the Apollo 11 moon landing and the Space Shuttle Endeavor launch, revealing the hosts' limited knowledge of Apollo 12.  This segued into an analysis of a recently released Pepsi commercial featuring Michael Jackson, focusing on a pyrotechnics accident that set Jackson's hair on fire.  The hosts and callers debated the severity of the burns and the potential fallout for Pepsi and the Jackson estate, speculating on why the video was only released posthumously.  The conversation then shifted to the hosts' disastrous Citadel stock investment and their (initially inaccurate) loss calculations.  Caller theories about the Pepsi commercial's release, including the possibility of the Jackson family seeking sympathy, were discussed, followed by a comedic audio segment featuring a backstage bit about a missing condiment drawer in E-Rox's desk.

The show continued with a discussion of Paul McCartney's surprise Ed Sullivan Theater performance, contrasting it with larger, planned events. This led to a tangent about the British Open, Greg Norman, and his ex-wife Chris Evert, with the hosts engaging in inaccurate and gossipy speculation about Evert's appearance and personal life. This devolved into sexually suggestive and disparaging comments about female athletes, including Monica Seles, Martina Navratilova, and Martina Hingis.  The segment concluded with a promise to play audio from the NHL Winter Classic press conference featuring Mayor Menino.

A significant portion of the show focused on a recurring bit mocking Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.  Numerous audio clips showcased Menino's mispronunciations (e.g., "Barferson"), mumbling, and microphone difficulties.  The hosts and callers repeatedly used offensive terms like "mumbling," "semi-retarded," "blithering idiot," and "fucking boob" to describe Menino, speculating on his continued electoral success.  This segment was interspersed with further crude comments about female athletes.

The show then featured an interview with Ian Halperin, author of a book about Michael Jackson.  The conversation began with a debate about dangerous areas in New York City, then moved to Halperin's book and its claims about Jackson's mental state (including a schizophrenia diagnosis), sexual orientation, and views on racism.  Halperin's claims were challenged by the hosts, leading to a debate about race and public perception in the entertainment industry.  Halperin discussed his research methodology, including interviews with men claiming sexual relationships with Jackson, and his undercover work with the Church of Scientology.  The hosts questioned Halperin's objectivity, suggesting potential exaggeration to sell his book. A heated exchange about the US and Canadian media ensued, followed by a humorous misunderstanding regarding Canadaâ€™s capital. The segment concluded with the debut of an intern's new bit, "Dick and Cider," which sparked discussion about its originality and further banter between Halperin and the hosts.

The final segment centered on producer Danny's unsuccessful jokes, dissected by the hosts, Sam Roberts, Travis, and E-Rock, alongside sexually explicit cupcake descriptions. Fat Matt made a birthday wish for employment and to no longer be fat and alone.  A "Backstage with ONA" bit featured Sam Roberts dramatically interviewing staff about Danny's jokes, resulting in further vulgar exchanges.  The show then touched upon news items, including a man arrested for bestiality, leading to more crude jokes.  Further segments included a discussion of a Maury Povich show featuring a promiscuous guest, a promotion for a Jim C.M.E. episode on Michael Jackson's death, the awarding of WWE prize packages, and a lengthy, sexually explicit conversation with Sam about his obsession with recording WWE wrestling shows and his sexual habits.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I just saw a video of the Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Space Endeavor.  Did it lift off?  Yeah, it went.  On this anniversary of the lift off of Apollo 11.  No shit.  Yes.  How many years ago?  40 years ago.  1969.  Wait, that was the one that went to the moon?  That was the first one to the moon.  That one landed on the moon?  That one landed on the moon? 
[00:00:30]  I always get confused by the numbers.  Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Mike Collins.  What happened to Apollo 13?  Oops.  That was the bad one, right?  That was the one that, yeah.  What about Apollo 12?  Check those gauges before you stir the tanks.  Not much is known about Apollo 12, though.  Yes, the in-between Apollo 12 is kind of like, ah.  Apollo 11 was the first one.  Did Apollo 12 land on the moon?  No.  Oh, yeah.  They did.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:01:00]  Did people walk around?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Treked around.  It was Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17.  It just sucks to be second.  Like, who were the astronauts on Apollo 12?  Oh, that's a good one.  You don't even know?  I don't even know.  And you're good at this stuff.  For real, you don't know?  Wow, that's...  Wait.  I have no idea.  And how many years after Apollo 11 did Apollo 12 land on the moon?  Two years.  They were pumping them out pretty quick at that point.  So Apollo 12 landed on the moon and astronauts walked, and we don't even know their names. 
[00:01:30]  We don't even know.  The second ship that actually landed on the moon.  Was there a big name?  Astronaut?  Let's see.  Commander.  Ted Astro.  Ted Astro.  Lempilot was Alan Bean.  Oh, okay.  I sort of remember that name.  And then Richard Gordon was the command module pilot.  And Commander Charles Conrad.  Charles Conrad, right.  I remember Charles Conrad.  It sucks to be second.  Wow.  You know when... 
[00:02:00]  Who broke the four-minute mile?  Bannister?  Yeah.  The first human being to break the four-minute mile.  You know there was another guy in that race that also broke the four-minute mile?  Oh!  Same race?  And he's called the other guy.  He's the other guy.  But supposedly the same race.  Everyone makes a big deal when that guy ran the first four-minute mile.  Yeah.  Or under the four-minute mile.  And there was another guy in the race that also did it.  But all the cameras or whatever it was back then went to Bannister. 
[00:02:30]  And the other guy just kind of had to walk off.  So, all right.  I didn't know that 40 years ago today.  Yeah.  40 years ago they launched.  Fucking space shuttle sucks.  Apollo 11.  I want cool stuff.  That was a biggie, man.  Yeah.  That was a biggie.  Now it's kind of, you know, everybody goes, eh, whatever.  It's a dumb space shuttle.  They haven't even redesigned the thing.  You know, by Apollo 13, people were already bored with moon launches.  I mean, they had Apollo 11 and Apollo 12. 
[00:03:00]  And then 13 got notoriety because of the whoopsie, you know.  Right.  Houston, we have a problem.  Mm-hmm.  And then people just stopped watching it.  You know what, though?  If you announced tomorrow that we're going back to the moon.  It would be huge.  It would be.  Everybody would watch that.  Sponsored by Coca-Cola and, you know.  How could you be bored by that?  The spacesuits would have Nike logos on them and shit.  I mean, and just crystal clear video. 
[00:03:30]  Digital.  Instead of, like, what it looked like back then.  Oh, God.  We should just do that.  We should just do it just to get the great fucking video of the moon.  What would the reason be?  I don't know.  They're actually, they are planning some stuff, an unmanned ship to go to the moon.  I don't think we ever landed on the moon.  You don't think we did?  You're one of those guys?  Yeah, because we would have been back already. 
[00:04:00]  We would have been back there by now.  It's all about the money, yo.  The money all went into the shuttle program.  All right.  So that's 40 years ago today.  And we got a space shuttle that just took off yesterday, I guess.  Yeah, let's get right into this Michael Jackson thing.  Holy shit.  He's still dead?  Well, now that the guy's dead, everything is coming out.  I mean, everything.  He's gay.  He liked licking lollipops.  He was a drug addict.  Yeah.  And this Pepsi commercial they filmed 25 years ago, they wait until the guy dies to finally release the video. 
[00:04:30]  Did you see it yesterday, Jimmy?  No.  Holy shit.  The Michael Jackson head-on-fire video is fantastic.  I don't know why they didn't release this sooner, because there would have been a lot of sympathy for Michael Jackson.  Because the...  I saw this video...  Who's bell is that?  Huh?  Oh.  I can't give a shit.  I saw the video yesterday.  I felt sorry for Michael Jackson.  It was unbelievable what happened to him.  Why are they releasing it now instead of just keeping it sitting on it?  I have no idea, but... 
[00:05:00]  This just goes to show you, though, the power of the Jackson family.  Like, they didn't want this out.  Yeah, but why is it out now?  They lost all their power in three weeks?  Yes.  You think so?  Yeah.  Pretty short.  Look, I'm holding up their PepsiCo's little kids.  Well, we're gonna...  I mean, go to, what, Us Weekly for the video if you haven't seen it yet.  It's everywhere today.  It hit yesterday.  The pyrotechnics went off perfectly during the rehearsals. 
[00:05:30]  And then what's coming up here...  After he walks down the stairs.  What's coming up here is another take that went horribly wrong.  Wait till you see this.  And this, I guess, led to him being dependent on painkillers.  Really?  This is the moment?  They're saying this was the catalyst that started the whole downfall of Michael Jackson as far as the drug...  The drug thing went.  Watch this, Jimmy.  Sixth take.  Sixth take.  Explosion goes up.  Right there.  He's still up on the platform. 
[00:06:00]  He has no idea.  His hair is completely on fire.  Oh, my God.  Completely on fire as he runs down the stairs to start performing and dance.  And then they all freak out and tackle him, put the fire out on his head.  Now, watch Jimmy when they lift his body up.  His scalp is completely...  How are they feeling?  Completely burnt.  Just watch this part first.  You're not going to believe what Michael Jackson looked like when they got him up off the ground.  Look at that.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  Big bald spot. 
[00:06:30]  Huge bald spot with hair just falling out.  All that hair is just gone in the front now.  And they said that hair never grew back.  That he wore wigs after that.  How did they feel if they had just burned the head of the biggest star in the world?  Oops.  The biggest star in the world.  Not just burned his head.  I mean, then he was dependent on painkillers.  For the next 25 years.  They said that was the moment.  Because he started taking, I think, Demerol.  And he never got off the Demerol.  He got addicted to it.  How is that out now that we never saw that? 
[00:07:00]  I don't know.  Because you know Pepsi doesn't want that out.  Right.  That's embarrassing.  Right.  That's so long ago.  But I'm thinking if you're Michael Jackson, you're going through all that shit where the public is starting to hate you, you kind of sneak this out there.  I'm talking about when he was alive.  And this isn't going to hurt him.  Well, dude, this was like during the peak of his popularity.  This is 84.  Sure.  84.  Well, they reworked what?  Billy Jean, I think?  And said Pepsi.  I don't know.  Pepsi Jean or Pimp.  I don't know what the fuck they did.  That went off when he was standing right in front of it. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Yes.  You think someone got fired?  Oh.  Oh.  You think someone hit the thing at the wrong time or hit automatic?  I don't know.  It had to be somebody on the button.  I don't know the details.  That shit is never automatic.  Does that make you feel bad for the guy or anything?  Do you get any emotions or feelings?  When that happens, it's like, yeah, you feel bad for something.  Bam.  I hear you dance his way down.  Right there.  Because you have no idea.  And he's still dancing.  Like, when people's hair catches on fire, they have no clue it's on fire.  Look at him.  He's dancing. 
[00:08:00]  He spins around.  Wow.  His head's smoking.  Dude, if you saw that in a movie, you'd be like, how the fuck did they do that?  Yeah, right?  And he went through it.  Jesus Christ.  I'm sure he had a lot of hair products.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm sure there was a lot of hair products on there.  That thing went up and just kept burning.  Second and third degree burns.  He looks fucked up there.  Damn.  Yeah, and he holds his head as he walks off.  It's just, he's completely fucked up. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, that's fucked up.  We got Mars today?  Because I would love to answer the phones, but I can't.  Mars.  I just can't answer the phones.  Where's the other mouse?  Oh, the other moose.  You got the other mouse?  I always throw it over here, and then Mars kind of takes it.  I can't believe that never came out before, dude.  I cannot believe that video.  Ed was saying before the show, we were talking about this video a little bit.  He said that back in 84, 85, around there, they actually released still pictures.  I remember that.  There were still pictures of his hair just on fire. 
[00:09:00]  And he's kind of standing there still dancing, and his hair's on fire.  I got to tell you, when it all went down originally, I thought it was no big deal.  Yeah.  I thought he caught fire a little bit, and they put it out, and holy crap, it could have  been really ugly.  No, it was ugly.  Wow.  That is an ugly scene.  The first person to run over was Keith Hernandez.  Did you see that guy?  Look at the guy that runs over and puts his head over.  Well, his old friend, Miko, that we've been seeing on CNN a lot.  Keith Hernandez.  Oh, there's Keith Hernandez. 
[00:09:30]  Look, there's Keith Hernandez, runs over.  What happened with that commercial?  Did it ever air or no?  Yeah, it aired.  Did it?  Absolutely, it aired.  How weird is that?  That's how powerful Pepsi was.  I think they took just another take, obviously, and they aired the commercial.  How much did he sue them for and win?  I think he only won 1.6 million, was it, Danny?  I'm not even sure.  I think it was 1.6, and then he gave it to charity.  I think that's what I heard last night.  That was all he got for that?  Yeah, they settled for like a million.  I don't know.  I don't think it was more than two. 
[00:10:00]  It was just about a million.  Because his pay was probably ridiculous.  And I think the...  No, it was 1.6.  And that settlement money was donated to the Michael Jackson Burns Center for Children.  Oh, of course.  He kind of didn't need the money.  The idea is, though, they set your head on fire.  That's worthy of a big settlement.  I need more than two million for that.  It's also Pepsi, though.  You know, I don't know if you want to fuck with Pepsi ever.  Or Michael Jackson?  He can fuck with anybody who wants.  Yeah.  When they set your head on fire, you can fuck with Pepsi. 
[00:10:30]  But they probably also made some closed-door deals with him and stuff and said,  Look, you know, let's not make a big deal.  Have a soda.  Are you thirsty?  You think you ever drank a Pepsi after that?  Oh, he was the Diet Coke kid.  You think he was the Diet Coke king?  Yeah.  I didn't let it.  Did I actually, Brooklyn Ace, did I actually stump Anthony?  Yes, you did.  You stumped him on Apollo 12.  Congratulations.  Yeah, yeah.  That was a complete stump.  Yeah, but I didn't know the answer.  Stumperoonie.  But that's the first time you've even come close, though. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  But, I mean, to actually stump Anthony, I need to know the answer to a question I ask him.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But Anthony is all about that NASA and astronaut thing.  But, boy, Apollo 12 sure got me.  Let's say hi to Marty in Kansas City.  Marty.  Howdy, Opie.  Hey there, little Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Hey, buddy.  Thank you.  And hi, Lonely Anthony.  I think your theme song could be Peggy Leeds.  Is that all there is? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, Lonely.  Yeah, yeah.  I was thinking of more Lonely songs for you yesterday.  Aw.  I came up with some good ones.  I want to play that really horrific version of Superstar.  That was in Juno.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That is creepy.  It might be too early to play that.  Why is it creepy?  Is it slow?  Or is it?  We've played it on the show.  Well, Travis, find that for Jimmy again.  Marty, what do you got?  Hey, I was going to say, I see the evil hand of Joe Jackson behind the release of this video  in order to garner sympathy for his freakish son, Michael Jackson. 
[00:12:00]  There's all this horrible negative stuff that's coming out.  Oh, maybe.  Joe Jackson.  You know what?  That's not a bad theory, Marty, but I go back to what I asked about 10 minutes ago.  Why wouldn't they do, why wouldn't they, if they had that in their playbook or whatever  you want to call it, why wouldn't they release it when things were ugly for Michael?  You know, 93, and what was the other, 2001, 2002, something like that?  Yeah, yeah.  You release it then when the whole world hates you because the whole world thinks you're  diddling kids. 
[00:12:30]  Then all of a sudden you have a little distraction and go, wow, we want to show you something that  happened to Michael 20 years ago.  But yeah, I mean, Joe Jackson is a sick one.  It does make you feel kind of bad for him.  That's a rough, that's a, your head's on fire and you're still dancing?  Completely felt bad for him yesterday when I saw that for the first time.  Thanks, Marty.  All right.  You got the original version of the?  I'm looking for it.  The whole commercial?  You have to put, you have to put Michael Jackson, Pepsi commercial, sans burning head. 
[00:13:00]  Psycho Bob is good for one.  Psycho Bob.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  The reason his head, his hair caught on fire is because he was using head smolders.  His what?  He was using head and smolders.  Oh, boo.  Head and smolders.  There's one of the takes, I guess.  Work.  Yeah.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work.  Work. 
[00:13:30]  Work.  Work.  Work.  Wow.  Your Pepsi generation.  How much did I spend for that commercial?  Work.  Work.  That's just it.  No wonder the settlement was for nothing.  I bet they paid him so much  God damn money  I guarantee you though 
[00:14:00]  For the use of his song  For his hit song Billy Jean at the time  How do you think that call got made to the head of Pepsi  Yeah we had an incident  What happened  The biggest star in the world that we got to do the commercial  He's in the burn unit  Can you imagine  You know Michael Jackson  Yeah well he's in the burn unit  At Cedars  We're not sure if he's going to live yet  Oh my god  How bad was the guy who did push the button 
[00:14:30]  Worried about his job  How was he trying to spin that  I don't know he was supposed to go down earlier  How do you spin that  You hit the button and the man's head was on fire  Sorry  Yeah that is a screw up  Wow  We've been talking about regular radio  A lot lately  Nick C in Pittsburgh  Have you checked our Citadel stock lately  Oh no  I heard it did well 
[00:15:00]  I haven't even looked  It's been taken off the  Delisted  Yeah it's been delisted  So I don't even look  What is it at  The listeners know  Know the whole story  Behind you and I and Citadel stock  Right  Yeah  We were both in for a little over a hundred large  Yeah  And how much was it worth when we did that bit  Under two thousand dollars  Yeah yeah  Something like that  We turned like over a hundred thousand into like two thousand dollars 
[00:15:30]  Yeah  Try to book and call it that  Oh my god  Well according to Nick C in Pittsburgh  Because the fans just follow Citadel every day  Oh why wouldn't they  It's on their iPhones and Blackberry  They have to know  They got a loft  It's down to three point one  Cent  Cent  Three point one cents a share  And it offered at nineteen dollars  And we got what  Two thousand shares  Did it come out to be  Fifty five hundred  Fifty five hundred shares 
[00:16:00]  Yeah  Yeah  So three point one into fifty five hundred is what  What's higher fifty five hundred  So that's under two thousand dollars  Danny  Under two thousand dollars  Of course it is  No how much is our stock worth now  Two hundred  Yeah fifty five  Right  It would be  Hundred shares  Three cents a share  Yeah  So that would be fifteen hundred  And then another  Fif  Sixteen  Sixteen fifty  Seventeen hundred 
[00:16:30]  Seventeen hundred and five dollars  There you go  All right cool  Nice  We turned over a hundred thousand dollars into seventeen hundred dollars  Rock  We  Suck  That's good  Right  Three cents  Isn't that good  They have Imus  They have Imus too  It's amazing  That didn't have the stock  It  Once it got delisted  That was it  It's over  It's over  It was over well before that  But  Once they take you off of there  There's no coming back  There's no way to get back on 
[00:17:00]  No way  No way  Let's go to Bill in Arizona  Bill  Morning boys  Hey  If I had to guess  I would say Jackson  Didn't own that video in any way  Because Pepsi  Wouldn't have released it  It probably  Was in the hands of an ex  Ad exec  Who then  Just decided to release it afterwards  Well we're going to see this video  A lot today  And I really want to know  Why  Why now  Maybe they paid a lot of money for it  Maybe Pepsi decided to get  A nice  Nice commercial out there  I don't know 
[00:17:30]  They're getting a lot of airplay  Everyone's thinking Pepsi today right  I haven't thought about Pepsi in a while  I think it's an ad exec  Yeah  Some kind of guy that had it  Didn't want to put it out  Because he would have gotten sued  But he could still get sued  That's what I don't understand  It's like  By who  Maybe they paid for it  The Jackson family  Maybe they paid for it  It's the internet  You can leak anything  Yeah you can  Knock it caught  I understand all that  Why not leak it before now  That is gold  That is gold  But that's gold 
[00:18:00]  No matter what day you see it  If you saw that a week  Now that he's dead  But if you saw that a week before  Michael Jackson died  It's still as effective in its gold  Not as big as now  So what  They were waiting for him to die  And then said  Alright let's release the video  Yeah  Maybe Michael didn't want it shown  Maybe it was a request he made  And that everybody honored  Because it just would have  There was a no  Like to show that  He just would have  Looked silly  He would have had to say  That was terrible  That hurt so much  It's just bad for the product  It looks silly  Spitting around with his head smoking  Exactly  Who are you  The guy from Kiss 
[00:18:30]  Alright listen  The phones are  Are lit  Because we did our math wrong  Our Citadel stock  Is not worth  $1,705  That's what I was thinking  It's worth  $170  Yes  Exactly  Huh  How did I mess that up  That's pennies  That's why  It's like  I knew it wasn't that much  I'd cash out  So we turned  Over $100,000  Into $170  $170  Isn't that fantastic 
[00:19:00]  Yeah they're showing  Wowie  You can see  Now he really was on fire  For a good few seconds  They're saying  At least 10 seconds  They just jumped  He must have been like  Why are they jumping me  And beating me up  Now he started spinning  To put his head out  You think that's why  He kept  He was spinning around  I don't know  Or was he still performing  I think he was still  Just performing  He didn't know  No he started spinning  At one point  He was just  Alright it's official  It's down to $170  I can't wait to see  Fareed for the first time  Oh boy is he going 
[00:19:30]  To get a talking  Thanks for that  Rob in New York  Rob  Thank him  Yeah doesn't anybody  Else see that  Bull spot  Smoking bull spot  Looks like the one  From Joe Pesci  On Home Alone  Right before he gets  Smacked with the paintball  Yeah true  Yeah we saw this  I wonder if he had  That bald spot before  Hell no  No that was  He was still a young guy  That was just  That's 25 years ago  So he was 25  26 years old  He had that  Jerry curl shit  In his hair  He really did  He had soul glow  Yeah  But they said  Now it makes sense  They said when he died 
[00:20:00]  He was pretty much  Completely bald  That moment really  Did fucking change his life  Yeah  It started him down  The path of  Painkillers  Who knows  He might have  Done them anyway  I don't know  Yeah  Alright  And then in other news  It was on the front page  Of the paper  It was really exciting  Here in New York yesterday  The whole city was alive  And the energy  You could feel it  Uptown, downtown  From the east to the west  It was just  An amazing day  For Paul McCartney  Whew  It was Beatlemania 
[00:20:30]  All over again  Oh wasn't it  Oh my god  It was exactly like  When they first came  To the Ed Sullivan Theater  Were you just out of your mind  Oh god  I was screaming  Hollering  Swooning  Yeah  I was home  Steve gave us  The inside scoop  Didi  He goes  Don't  That's the thing  I was filming a video  Yesterday  It didn't work  So I didn't put it up  Or whatever  But Steve is like  I can't  I can't have this on camera  I can't have you  Twitter this  He was all dramatic  And what he couldn't have 
[00:21:00]  On camera  Was the fact that  Paul McCartney  Was playing above  You know  The Ed Sullivan Theater  On the Marquee  Why?  I think Paul McCartney  Would have done better  If the info  Really got out  Yeah  It was sort of out there  So I don't know  A few hundred people  Showed up outside  The Ed Sullivan Theater  And Paul McCartney  Did seven songs outside  Yeah  And the video  They were shown in New York  Wow  It was just like  When they landed  When the Beatles landed  People were going nuts  They were climbing  Trying to get at Paul McCartney  Yeah  Oh yeah 
[00:21:30]  No they weren't  They could barely  Figure out what was going on  Not quite the U2 video  Where the streets have no name  Either  Where they're on the rooftop  They were all just  Kind of standing around  Yeah  You know  They really should have  Got the word out  For real  Or maybe they did  And maybe people  Just don't care anymore  Yeah  Yeah  It's kind of like  Just eh  I know he's playing  The first shows  At Citi Field  Really?  The first rock shows  Yeah  Over the weekend  It's going to be pulled apart  What is this  The whole fucking  Let me do what I did  40 years ago tour

[00:23:30]  Get back  And I'll tell you why  The listener of Paul McCartney  Do Get Back  And it sounds exactly  How he sang it  40 years ago  Yeah  So why can't  God make  Humans out of  The same material  The vocal cords  Are made out of  And then we wouldn't age  Because you look at  Like Robert Plant  And you realize  He can't  He can't hit the notes  Yeah 
[00:24:00]  This could just be  The Beatles  Yeah  Absolutely  Sounds good  Like any song  McCartney sang  It's a little sound  Exactly like  That's bad  60 years old  Keyboard  Ripped  I think he's got  Like a 25 year old  Guitarist  Yeah  Of course  These guys 
[00:24:30]  Did he play a stupid  New song  Yeah he did  A little ukulele  You want to hear  The new song too  Oh fuck  What a toe-tapper  This is  Don't you want to see  Miss fuck  Get back  The way you want  Speed all  Call  Jasper autograph  Call  I don't think  You can get near him  No  Loretta's dead 
[00:25:00]  Get back to the  Nursing home  Loretta  Loretta's directing  Traffic in a hospital  Johnny  Shit running down  The back of my thigh  Get back  To get back  To where you want  Speed all  Get back  Get back  Get back  To where you want  Speed all 
[00:25:30]  Damn  You want to get back?  Do you want to get back?  I do  Get back where?  I do too Jimmy  That wins the award  By the way  Worst crowd  Interaction ever  Oh my god  Do you want to get back?  Because everything  Has to be safe now  Get back  Get back 
[00:26:00]  To your bed  Loretta  Any other songs?  I think that was the only one  They actually played on  David Letterman last night  There was one more  But it's from his new album  They didn't even say  What the name of the song was  But out on the marquee  He played Helter Skelter  And what was the third Beatles song?  Electric Argument is the new one  Really?  Yes  It just sucks 
[00:26:30]  I heard they had to get permits  And all that  To get that done  When the Beatles did that originally  And when U2 did their thing  You just do it  But you can't just do it anymore  Everything has to be planned out  Even anarchy has to be planned out  Yeah  With lawyers and permits  That U2 one is great man  It's just cops  Freaking the fuck out  Pointing  Getting mad  Going what the fuck is going on?  You can't just  Have a U2 concert on the roof  They were so blindsided  You would think  Somebody would have known 
[00:27:00]  It just completely stopped traffic  People were just  Sticking their heads out the windows  And everything  That is a great video  It was huge  That's a great video  Absolutely  Here's the new one  From Paul McCartney  We're lucky enough now  To get a second song  Sounds like David Letterman  And performing something  From his most recent album  Electric Arguments  Which he recorded as the fireman  Please welcome  Once again  Paul McCartney  Everyone  Not quite 
[00:27:30]  Get back  It's got to suck  To be Paul McCartney  Well  I mean people just want  To hear Beatles songs  And a couple Wings songs  Yeah yeah 
[00:28:00]  Some Wings songs  A couple Wings songs  True  This new stuff  What Jimmy  What  Oh this one  Oh god  I don't hate this one  As much as I used to  No I hate this  What's ukulele  Please hate  I feel good  Hate Jimmy  I'm in a good mood  Turn it up there  Are they all gonna  It really is a trite song 
[00:28:30]  Of just a meaningless evening  Everyone's just dancing around  It's like the safety dance  But it's in the streets  Tonight  Tonight  That is terrible  It's awful  It's awful right  Yeah  Who's the young  Put-in-head look-a-like  That plays with Paul McCartney  You can do anything  You wanna do  Everybody gonna dance tonight  You can put this song up  Against the stuff you did  With the Beatles 
[00:29:00]  You can put this against  The stuff that I've done  In the shower  That you hold up  There you go  Oh  Oh  And then there's whistling  I just don't like the lyrics  Everybody gonna dance tonight  I don't like that  Chicka chicka chicka chicka chicka  His whistling sucks  What's the greatest whistling song  Of all time  Anthony Cumia  Ah yeah  Best whistling song  It's a band you mention a lot  You're the only one in studio  That likes that band 
[00:29:30]  I don't know  Really  Best whistling  Because I would give it to  Probably  Billy Joel  Scenes from an Italian restaurant  Ah  Does he whistle on that?  Yeah  It's a good one  Yeah  That's a good whistling  I was thinking Molly Hatchett  Oh  That's a quick  Yeah  That's a quick  Like whistle whistle  I mean a toony whistle  Is probably  Yeah  Billy Joel's song  You gotta be pretty brave  To fucking whistle in a song  Patience Guns N' Roses  Nice 
[00:30:00]  That's a good whistle  Okay  That's a good whistle  Alright with this song  Can we turn this down  I wanna get up and dance around  All night  We can fade this one out  Everybody gonna stamp their feet  Really?  Ugh  On the CD  That put this song on it  My ex-wife gonna stamp her foot  That's a silly  Heather Mills joke  Check  Yeah  Good for Letterman though  That was a nice get for him  Fuck yeah man  I just thought it would be  A little crazier  But I guess in this day and age 
[00:30:30]  You just can't  Take the change  Don't forget on camera though  On camera  You know  Just on the top of the  Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway  Speaking of crazy  Know who did the crazy right  Was Dave Chappelle  Recently  You hear what he did  With his Twitter?  No  I think he was in Portland  Was it Portland?  And he kinda tweeted  That he's gonna like  Do an impromptu thing  Around City Hall  Or somewhere in downtown Portland  And he had a tiny little speaker  All set up  And he was gonna do  A little stand up  He was just trying out  You know  See what this Twitter thing  Could do 
[00:31:00]  And thousands and thousands  Of people showed up  It was a complete mob scene  Wow  And most of the people  Couldn't even hear him  Because he only brought  A tiny little speaker  A little speaker  Almost like a Mr. Microphone  I'm gonna do the same thing  Except beg people to show up  At a comedy club  And ate well  God damn it  I wanna be Chappelle  I just wanna be Dave  Maybe you can get  The whole story  I think I got the facts  Pretty accurate there  But  You know the funny thing  Is to a guy like that  Who really is a good comic man  He's a funny fuck  It's like  You see him at the comedy  Cellar sometimes  He hasn't come in in a while 
[00:31:30]  But literally he comes in late  And he'll go on sometimes  For just two and a half hours  Just fucking sitting on the piano  And people stay  And they watch him  What a great feeling  He's just  He's kind of exploring  And playing around  I love when you guys do that  I love going to the cellar  For that reason  Yeah  Because I know you guys  Are like trying out new material  And just  Not just fucking around  Absolutely not  But definitely trying to  Feel your way around  New bits and stuff  And then  You go  You definitely go off-roading  And just 
[00:32:00]  You know  It's a good way to put it  Off-roading  Off-roading  And just trying to  You know  You just go with the flow  I love that  When comics do that  He'll do that for two and a half hours  Sometimes  Yeah  Fucking  Chappelle is fucking funny  Yes he is  Holy shit  And rich  Is he rich?  Oh Jesus  He certainly is  I heard he has a big penis  I don't know if that's true  But I've heard  Why isn't he making movies?  I don't know  He doesn't want to do that TV thing  Obviously  He walked away from that  He's got to be kind of bored  With stand-up  Is this the video  Of Dave Chappelle? 
[00:32:30]  Wow  Where is this?  Like I said  I think it's Portland  Downtown Portland  How many Twitter followers  Did he have?  Jesus Christ  Did he do Portland?  I don't know  But the word got out  Ken in Jersey  Hey how you doing?  Getting back to the Jacksons  You think maybe the Jacksons  Released that video on purpose  Because they know  What's going to be  In the toxicology report?  And maybe they're  Getting the sympathy now?  Ah  Well look what he did  In advance  You know  It's like look what happened to him  This is why  Oh yeah 
[00:33:00]  Because everyone's  Showing the video  And a lot of people are saying  This is what started  His drug abuse  People are saying  People are saying it  Who are these people?  Right  Thank you Ken  That's a good theory  Give me a question  Yes sir  Jimmy I always thought  You had a familiar face  And somebody said to me  The other day  They thought you were  The love child of Don Rickles  Is that true?

[00:38:00]  A fine idea  I like it  Maybe I'll do that  No I don't think  Anthony was saying  That he's sad or anything  He was just  No I was saying  He was just stating yesterday  That he was a bit lonely  For one day  One day  One day he went down  The lonely road  Yeah just sitting there  Going wow  I've really got no one  To hang out with  And us being complete assholes  Decided to exploit it  To the fullest  Yes  It was just one afternoon  I think  Sitting there  Every day  Crying into my  Bank account  This guy basically has  The new Playboy mansion  And we're you know

[00:40:30]  I think it's the  Flyers and the Bruins  And the reason  I bring this  To the show today  Is because our old pal  Mayor Menino  Was at the press conference  And holy shit  We got some great audio  Yeah  Just stunning audio  From this babbling buffoon  I bet he sounded good  God damn that looks  And I don't know  You know what  I take a peek  At the Phillies  From time to time  But to see Pedro Martinez  With a Phillies hat on  Is the fucking strangest thing  I've ever seen in my life  And a sore on his lip  Yeah  Does he have a sore  On his lip too  Looks like it 
[00:41:00]  There he is  What the fuck  I hate seeing these  Athletes with the weird  Hats on  You know what I mean  When you're used to  When you're used to  Seeing them one way  Him with a Phillies hat  Is bizarre  Which way  And he's saying  He still loves the Mets  Still loves the Mets  You can't love the Mets  If you're playing  For the Phillies  Why didn't they  Why didn't they re-sign him  I don't know  The back history  On that one Jimmy  I just don't know  He's an asshole  Asshole  Alright  We're gonna do  A little backstage

[00:42:00]  The lost condiments  What lost condiments  Well there's a drawer  In E-Rox desk  Where he keeps  A lot of condiments  For like ketchup  And mayonnaise  And hot sauce  He has a condiment  Drawer in his desk  At work  Yeah he does  And uh  They went missing  Do you think  That's funny  That he has  A condiment drawer  Yeah  It is pretty funny  When news  Of a condiment drawer  Came up  We had to get  The scoop  So we went  To the chubby  Bunny himself  E-Rox  For the details 
[00:42:30]  E-Rox  What's Pierce doing  Not a whole  Fucking lot  He doesn't do  Anything you ask him  Did you hear  What I talked to him  About it a little bit ago  I think so  I think it involves  The condiment drawer  Why do you have  A condiment drawer  It's a communal  Condiment drawer  It's the continuation  Of Kenny's ketchup drawer  From K-Rock  Then why is it  In your desk  Because there's no  Because there's no  Where else to put it  There's plenty  Other places to put it  I don't fucking know  They were here  And now they're gone  I just asked  What happened to them 
[00:43:00]  How much mayonnaise  Was in the condiment drawer  Actually none  We had ketchup  We had salt and pepper  And there was a lot  Of hot sauce in here  What'd you put hot sauce on  I don't eat hot sauce  Then why'd you keep it  In your condiment drawer  Because it was for everybody  Not for me  Then how come you were  The only one who knew about it  Everybody knew about it  Alright I'm gonna ask around  Go ahead  Obviously a gauntlet  Was thrown down  So we found the O&A staff  And asked how many of them  Knew of E-Rock's condiment stash  Hey Troy  Did you know Eric Nagel

[01:26:30]  You guys want to hear  Any of these  Mayor Menino  Mumbles and misspeaks  Through remembering  A colleague  Who had just died  Of cancer  Yes  That's gotta be a good one  Yeah  This was a younger  Menino  We're hearing now  By the way  Yeah  I want to ask you all  To join me  In a moment of silence  And I have our friend  Jim Kelly  Jim passed this morning  After a long battle 
[01:27:00]  With cancer  Jim was a great guy  You all know  We didn't agree  On a lot of issues  I made him have more lawyers  And I had more lawyers  And uh  But I won all the time  But his commitment  To his constituents  Was tremendous  Like my tongue  Yeah that one wasn't  That one was not bad  That one was not bad  Illegal guns  Ant  Alright  Trying to end with 
[01:27:30]  A big one  Boffo  In the year  That just ended  The Boston police  Took more than  1,800 guns  Off of Boston streets  That's twice as many  As the previous year  Illegal guns  Are a major problem  But so is the fact  They've stopped  Feeling shocked  By all these guns  What? 
[01:28:00]  Think about it  1,800 guns  That's like collecting  Five guns a day  Every day  All year long  That's a lot of  Death and despair  That was prevented  Alright  We gotta  Yeah we gotta  Take a break  We have a very brief  Time with him  Oh we have to  Go right to it  I'm sorry  I knew you wanted  Take a break  Alright  Bring him in  We got Ian Halpern  Let's bring Ian in  Ian Halpern  Alright 
[01:28:30]  What's up Ian  What's going on  Hello  Hi  Of course you got  The new book  Unmasked  The final years  Of Michael Jackson  Is that what we're  Here for?  I think so  Yes  Did you see the video  Of his hair going on fire?  Yeah I did  Amazing right?  Yeah  Why do you think  That's just being  Released today?  Who had possession of that?  Well they're  You know  They're gonna go on  A campaign to  Get sympathy for him  And to  It's like the  The film  The video that was  Released a couple  Of weeks ago  After he died 
[01:29:00]  Making him look like  Looking fantastic  But ask me about that  I'll disprove the whole thing  What do you mean?  They took one take  From a song  They don't  What they failed to show  Was the outtake  When he's like  Exhausted  Practically faint  Oh you're talking about  The  Let me  The rehearsals  The rehearsals  Yeah exactly  We all saw the same  10 minute  10 second clip  Where he looks pretty good  He's dancing along  With his dancers  And he's in good form  Yeah  And you're saying  There's actual video out there  Where he looks  Awful and exhausted 
[01:29:30]  I interviewed the choreographers  Right right  Talking to the mic sir  Please  Are we on air now?  Yeah yeah  I don't even know  I thought there was  Commercial going  Good morning guys  We wanted to go to commercial  But we know your time  Is very valuable  So  No we're talking about  That video that emerged  On CNN shortly  After Michael died  And  I had  Some concerns  After seeing that video  I thought maybe I was due  Maybe this guy was  In  In the proper shape  To do this 50 date  Residency 
[01:30:00]  At 02  Now I had a choreographer  For Michael Jackson  Examine the video  He said  Unwaveringly  That Michael  Was  Sluggish  Not in sync  With the rest of the dancers  This was not  Vintage Michael Jackson  And  That night  Michael said  He didn't think  He could pull off the shows  Now  Michael Jackson  Again  He's a type of  Performer  Who will only  Only perform  At 110%  It's not like  Some athlete 
[01:30:30]  Let's say  A baseball player  Who's injured  And you pump him up  With some drugs  Put him back  In center field  And he fakes the funk  And everybody believes  He's back  Michael Jackson  Always said  He would not perform  At anything less  Than 100%  Because he loved  His fans so much  And it says  That you apparently  Set out with intention  To write a book  To kind of  I guess  This could be wrong  Prove that he's a pedophile  But you ended up  Without a shred of evidence  And you kind of  Started to believe  The other way  Well you know  I started this case  As a documentary 
[01:31:00]  After over 300 hours  Of footage  That I filmed  Over the years  On this case  I started in 205  I was livid  When Michael was acquitted  At that Santa Barbara trial  I thought we had  Another case of OJ Simpson  On our hands  Another case of  High profiled lawyers  Getting their client  Off the hook  And I was intent  To prove to the world  That Jackson was guilty  Was a child molester  And I set out  On the trail 
[01:31:30]  Now four years later  I conclude  100%  He's not a child molester  He was a victim  Of extortion  People trying to  Bring him down  Falsely  And that's a sad case  About Michael Jackson  He always had  Undesirables  Around him  He has to be  Held accountable  For that  You're only as good  As the people  You surround yourself  With in life  Wasn't that odd  That he did  Fess up to the fact  That he did sleep  In the same bed  With children  And things like that  I mean that's just 
[01:32:00]  I interviewed  Well over  Thousands of people  Involved in the case  Including everyone  In the inner circle  I interviewed  A lot of kids  Who stayed at Neverland  A lot of their families  What you saw  In that documentary  Was bogus  Michael was on drugs  During that time  He was goaded  By Mr. Beshear  Into doing  Certain things  That he didn't  Want to do  The kids insist  That Michael Jackson 
[01:32:30]  Only was concerned  About children  He let cancer victims  Economically deprived  Children  Into his home  He never slept  In their beds  He only slept  On a mat  Next to them  And this is  From multiple accounts  Now let's  Let's flash back  To 1993  Jordan Chandler case  I  I have  Which one is Chandler  Is that the  Is that the  15.3 million dollar  Yes  The settlement  15 and change  Which is weird  That he would pay that out 
[01:33:00]  Well I'll tell you what  Yeah we'll get into it  I'll tell you what  I have a document  In my possession  A court approved document  That says the insurance company  Forced Michael Jackson  To settle  They wouldn't back him anymore  Michael was livid  He broke down crying  He insisted  He was innocent  He maintained his innocence  Till the day he died  Did he pay that money  Or was that insurance company  Money who said  Settle this  We'll pay this  If you don't  You're on your own  The insurance company 
[01:33:30]  Forced them to settle  Okay so they pretty much  Paid  Oh okay  But why wouldn't he  Take his own money  At that point  And continue fighting  The case  Well that's a lot of money  15  Yeah but it's a lot of money  To give to somebody  If you didn't do anything either  I mean  I understand  If you spent it  As a defense  In court  You could rip apart  Somebody with 15 million dollars  Especially people  That don't have the money  Why wouldn't you choose  That venue  I'll tell you why  I once met  The late great  Johnny Cochran  When he was up in Toronto 
[01:34:00]  He told me personally  Two things  He said look  OJ Simpson  I have a headache  OJ Simpson  Oh come on  Johnny Cochran  May he rest in peace  Why are you calling  The late great though  Well Johnny Cochran  Was a legal genius  You gotta give him that  We'll give you that  He said  He did not win  The OJ case  Marsha Clark lost it  Well yeah  He also told me  Never trust LAPD  Especially when it comes  To high profile 
[01:34:30]  Celebrity cases  Michael Jackson's people  Were worried  No matter what  They were going to  Bring him down  He  He would get  A criminal record  If the case went further  Not only did the  Insurance company  Force him to settle  But his handlers  How much  It would have been  Career sous  How much of that money  Was his  Because we're saying  15, 3 million  But that was  Insurance company money  How much of that money  Was actually his  That he paid out  Or was it all their money  It's never been determined  And you also said  It would be career suicide 
[01:35:00]  But it ended up being  Career suicide anyway  It's true  You know why  Because  If it would have been  In Michael's own words  A Caucasian singer  Let's say George Michael  For instance  George Michael  Was convicted  Right  Nobody cares  George Michael  Keeps going on  Sells out arenas  When it comes to  African American  Entertainers  We've had a problem  Even if they're  Acquitted  They're still perceived  As being guilty  For instance  Michael Jackson 
[01:35:30]  In my book  I prove that he's gay  Not a child molester  100%  Not a child molester  Why didn't  Michael Jackson  Ever come out  Two reasons  If he would have  Come out  People would have  Immediately  Thought he was  A child molester  And also  African American  Artists  Have you ever read  The book  Hiding in Hip Hop  No why would I  You should read it  Alright  I'll pick it up  And read it  It's all about  It was published  Last year 
[01:36:00]  By Terenstein  A fine writer  It's all about  Why African American  Hip Hop artists  Cannot come out  Of the closet  I don't think  That has anything  To do with race  As much as it has  To do with  Credibility  And your audience  Yeah  They don't want  To think that  This guy's gay  Out there  More so than  Race  Now I heard  Your interview  And I watched  It on Fox News  With all due respect  Let's backtrack  Here for a second  Can Rosie come out  Of the closet  With her audience  No because she  Knew it hurt her  She came out  After her show  Because her target 
[01:36:30]  Demo  I'm talking about  The music industry  I'm not talking  About the talk show  Industry  Apples and oranges  Let's talk about  The music industry  Because that's where  Michael Jackson  Made his bread and butter  George Michael  Came out  Boy George  Elton John  Their popularity  Goes through the ceiling  When they come out  Why haven't  African American  Musicians been able  To come out  There's a reason  Maybe the African American  Community's view  On homosexuals  Is too based  In religion  And a bit dated  So African American 
[01:37:00]  Entertainers make the choice  I don't want to lose  The money I'm making  From this community  Because of their prejudice  Against homosexuals  I don't think it has  Anything to do  With prejudice  As much as it does  An anti-homosexual bias  In the African American  Community  I'm talking to  Michael Jackson's  Own words  And I respect your opinion  But this is what  Michael Jackson  Thought  What did he say  He did not want  To come out  Because he was worried  He would be vilified  His career would be over  He  In his own words  There's been so many  African American  Entertainers  Over the decades 
[01:37:30]  Who have not come out  Because they haven't been  Who is it ruined  They would have been  Career suicide  But your examples  Were a little lame  Because boy George  I mean no one  Looked at him  Like he was  Some kind of rock god  Like he was  Robert Plant up there  I mean people  Already knew  Everybody knew  Something's going on  With him  George Michael  Elton John  George Michael  Same thing  He was a bit swishy  When he came out  That was pretty obvious  And George Michael  Is not doing particularly  Well career wise  I mean he's still  A very well respected guy  He came back last year  And the tour  Went through the ceiling  He made a lot of money  But it did hurt him  At one point though  To continue with your point  I think there's a lot  Of white rock guys 
[01:38:00]  That are probably gay  And are scared  For the same reason  Because they know  Their audience  You look at Judas Priest  Robert Halford  Came out  And a lot of his fans  These hardcore  Metalhead guys  Are just like  I'm not  You know  I'm not going to  See a fag  I'm not  You know  So I think that  I couldn't see your point  On race  Really playing into it  That's because you're Caucasian  With all due respect  No  With all due respect  When you go  You know  There's a line 
[01:38:30]  When you go to the courthouse  Looking for justice  You see just us  Right  It's a Richard Pryor line  And it's very accurate  At some point  But that doesn't  But I know that  Any African American  Listening to this show  So it doesn't mean  That race  Will take what I have to say  Yes because it's an easy  It's an easy excuse  And relate to it  But maybe they'll relate to it  As Caucasians in here  Why  We cannot comment on this  Why do you  Why do you  Hold on  Why do you have  Just one second  No no  Why do you have the authority  On  Why is your opinion relatable  Like  Well because I understand 
[01:39:00]  The way Africans  Americans are a few  But we don't  Like why do you  As a white guy  Understand it  But we don't  Because this isn't my opinion  This is the opinion  Of Michael Jackson  The world's greatest  Entertainer  The world's greatest artist  But there are other opinions  That are contrary  I'm just a reporter  My opinion's not in the book  Of course it is  Of course  I'm listening to your opinion  Which is okay  My opinion is not in the book  Sure it is  I'm parlaying  What I was told  By Jackson  Jackson's handlers  That Michael Jackson  Did not want to come out  Because he feared racism 
[01:39:30]  That is  I bet what you're saying  Is completely accurate  But when you say  Because he feared racism  That's one thing  But for you to sit there  And go  Well you as a Caucasian  Don't understand  It's like  I'm not that imperceptive  That I  I'm not  I'm not insulting you  As being imperceptive  Or anybody as a white guy  Is not that imperceptive  I have talked  To civil rights activists  About this  And I've understood  As Caucasians  We cannot understand  You're going to get a  Bias opinion  From an activist  Than you will 
[01:40:00]  Just from a regular  Working Joe  Black guy  Off the street  An activist has an agenda  Let me ask you a question  Sure  Have you ever gone out  And been denied  A seat in a restaurant  Because of the color  Of your skin  No  Have you ever gone out  And not been hired  For a job  Because of the color  Of your skin  No  I rest my case  It's just complete incompetence  That causes him jobs  Exactly  But that's not a case  That you're resting  Because you're talking  About a view on homosexual  Somebody's fear of racism  We are in New York City  Right now 
[01:40:30]  You're screaming  No I'm not screaming  It's the morning  And I've got to get my  Vocal yoga exercise  We are in New York City  Right now  And I love this show  No blacks in this room  I saw you guys on Letterman  Last year  The year before  I thought you guys were great  I was in the studio on you  Yes sir  But I'm in New York City  Right now  The world's most multicultural city  On one of the top shows  In the city  And there's not one  One African American  In this studio  That's why it's one of the top shows  I as a Jew  From Montreal 
[01:41:00]  Represent the visible minorities  Here today  So that's what I'm saying  We're in no position  To comment on all this  That's silly though  Of course we are in a position  Of course we are  It took a guy from Canada  Because all of you motherfuckers  Were on your ass  I had to come up here  And get the story  Behind the story  Look I didn't want to do  The Michael  Holy shit  That's silly  I didn't want to do  The Michael Jackson story  You're out of your mind now  Of course you wanted to  The Michael Jackson story  You're sounding silly  Why didn't anybody else  Get the story  Why didn't anybody else  Get the story 
[01:41:30]  Yell at reporters  Not radio  Yell at the reporters  Yell at the rest of the  Mainstream media  I'm not yelling at you guys  Yell at the media  The media is shit  They're part of the media  This was easier than getting  The Rodney King tapes  This case  The Rodney King tapes  Were pretty easy to get  I had to track here  On a Greyhound bus  With a video camera  From Canada  I live in the woods in Canada  So do you think  Because I was watching TV  All these years  And said  Where are these guys  They're sitting  They're sitting in their ivory towers  No no no  You're in an ivory tower  Because you're pontificating  About how white and black  Relationships are  We're in Canada  What racial problems 
[01:42:00]  Have you had  Stop it  You're pontificating  About how we in America  Are dealing with race  This is one of the top shows  And there's no black people  Who gives a shit  Well we are New York City  The world's most cultural city  Multicultural  You said that  I understand that  We should throw a black guy in here  Just for the fuck  Don't be silly  Throwing a token hot black chick  We don't do that  That's elitist  That's elitist  That's white elitism  That's white guilt  We don't do that  We bring people in  Who we like to have on the show  We don't base it on race  Because we feel that black people  Need a bone thrown to them  They don't 
[01:42:30]  They're qualified  They don't need me  As the almighty white man  To toss them a little scrap  From my table  They don't need that  That's called sarcasm  Because you have never gone  To a job interview  And been forced to  Leave the room  Because of the color of your skin  Neither have you  So how can you pontificate on it  Any more than I can  If you want to talk experientially  That's what I'm talking about  During my investigation  What I learned from  Michael Jackson and his handlers  Their opinions  Absolutely  Michael Jackson was beloved  All over the world  How many people could survive  The perception  Okay albeit incorrect 
[01:43:00]  According to your book  How many people could survive  The perception  That they're child molesters  And still sell out  50 fucking shows  At the O2 arena  He was loved  All over the world  First of all  He was acquitted  I said perception  If it would have been  A Caucasian  Being acquitted  It would have been  End of story  Michael Jackson  Not true  There's a  Let me finish  I'm the guest here today  Yes you are  But you're behaving like a host  Let me finish  Yes I know you're wrong 
[01:43:30]  You're the guest  Michael Jackson  Yes  The reason why he went to London  Why do you think he went to London  Because there's a lot of black people there  And we're racist in America  I don't know  Because I don't know why  You tell me  Because sentiment in the US  Was that Michael Jackson was guilty  After he was acquitted  Yes  Exactly  Sentiment was that  He went to the UK  Because it was a safety zone for him there  There was no fear of people showing up  Protesting  Shooting him  He was in fear for his life  After he was acquitted in 205 
[01:44:00]  Which I outlined clearly in the book  Yes  He left the US  Traveled with the kids to Bahrain  To Ireland  Yes  He could not stay in the US  He feared for his life  Fair enough  Look at R. Kelly by the way  Look at R. Kelly  Racist country we are  This video  It looked to me like in that video  Yeah  It appeared to people  That R. Kelly was pissing on a youngster  And apparently  He just got acquitted  Marion Barry  Who has done what  Smoke crack in a hotel  Stalking it  He stayed  He got re-elected  So don't act like black people in this country  Are just treated terribly 
[01:44:30]  Once they're acquitted  They're singled out  Stop it  Don't tell me to stop it  That's silly  Let me tell you something  Why do we just remember  All these isolated incidents  Of African Americans  Who have been acquitted  And still we think they're guilty  Because when Caucasians  Are acquitted  In this country  They're able to move on  Really like the LAPD officers  Who were acquitted  And to be honest  I didn't feel like  Hold on  I felt like they should have been  I felt like they should have been convicted  I felt like that acquittal 
[01:45:00]  Which caused the Rodney King beating  Was a disgusting acquittal  It was again  The prosecution  Mishandling the case  Because they never called  Rodney King to testify  So the police officer's testimony  Had to be accepted  And I felt that was  A disgusting acquittal  And when they were convicted  On civil rights charges  I completely agreed with it  So it's like  You can't say that  Just because someone's acquitted  That we go  Oh well  I guess they're guilty anyway  Because they're black  We see that  If it's that obvious  With a white person  We feel the same way  And that's unfair to say that  Don't put that on me  I'm not putting it on you  But you are  As a white guy  You're saying that  You're Caucasians  I am one of them  What I learned during this case 
[01:45:30]  As Caucasians  We cannot understand  The persecution  The racism  And the segregation  That African Americans  Have gone through  And still experience  So you're saying  That we can't comment on abortion  We shouldn't be able to talk about  Any women's issues  Because we're not women  Just because you can't  Experientially comprehend something  Doesn't mean you can't have  An opinion on it  This is Michael Jackson  Michael Jackson  I'm not dealing with women's issues  That's a whole other subject  Which I'm also sympathetic to  And that might be the next book  It falls under the same heading  As if we're not that person 
[01:46:00]  We can't comprehend it  Right now I'm here to talk about  You're going beyond Michael Jackson  To a racial thing  I'm not going beyond  Because that's what  The late great Michael Jackson  That's what haunted him  For so many years  But you also said  You throw away  Some of the stuff he said  Because you said  He was on drugs  So where do you draw the line  That this is legitimate  It was enabling him  It was doctors enabling him  All these years  Yeah that's just like  They did with Elvis  A white guy  Yes Dr. DeCopolis did with Elvis  And I'm sure his doctors  Probably did with him  Because that's what happens 
[01:46:30]  When you have that kind of money  Allegedly Elvis said  The doctor goes  I don't want to prescribe you this drug  He goes I'll buy the goddamn drugstore  When you have that kind of money  And that kind of power  Come on  Let me tell you something  That goes beyond race  The day Michael Jackson  Announced this comeback  I went on  The biggest breakfast show  In the UK  GMTV  It's about 10 times the size  Of the Today Show  That's what they tell me  Something like that  Okay  I said  That the comeback  Would never happen  He was in no physical  Or mental shape 
[01:47:00]  Remember  I predicted  December 24th  2008  It made world headlines  Michael Jackson  Had six months to live  I just didn't come up  With some statement  Why did you predict that?  Okay  Two sources in this camp  Contacted me  Told me  He had a debilitating illness  He was gravely ill  He was in no mental shape  He had a lung disease  What kind of lung disease?  It's called alpha-1  Are you familiar with alpha-1 antitrypsin?  So potentially fatal lung disease  I said in the same article  He could live with alpha-1 
[01:47:30]  Until 110 years old  And die of the flu first  But anorexia  One of the biggest side effects  Of anorexia is cardiac arrest  Now this was in the book  Before he died  Right  The book was on the presses  The day he died  I came out after talk  The sources came to me  Because they understood  My work was going to be  Sympathetic to Michael  They were concerned  That they were outnumbered  By the enablers  In his camp  And they had all signed  Confidentiality agreements  These guys  They were using me 
[01:48:00]  To get the story out  I came out with the story  December 24th  2008  The next day  What's 2008?  February 2008?  February 2008?  No  December 24th  2008  Oh  2 of 2008  I'm from Canada  So we have a bit of  Different lingo  It's like British and U.S.  Oh, okay  2008  2008  Gotcha  Next day  Jackson's personal manager  And sole representative  Dr. Tomei Tomei  He calls himself  By the way  I researched this guy 
[01:48:30]  He has no medical degree  Whatsoever  According to the  American Medical Association  He came out  And called my claims  A complete fabrication  This was the problem  With the Jackson camp  Instead of rushing  To judgment  On what I said  They should have  Checked this guy  Into hospital  Not with the doctors  That were around him  But with a world class doctor  Got him the right help  Instead  They're planning  A concert tour  For him  The guy was in a wheelchair  He was wearing  He was wearing a surgical mask  And they wanted him 
[01:49:00]  To go on  A 50 day concert tour  Not even the heavy metal guys  You talk about  Would do this easily  No matter what type of  He's wife has been  Known to push him out  A little bit  But I mean  Again  A heavy metal guy  Probably couldn't have  Sold like Michael Jackson  I mean let's be honest  No one debates  Michael Jackson's impact  With a power he has  As an entertainer  My only debate with you  It's not even what you say  In the book  Which is probably accurate  Because you were there  It is only  What I see  As an elitist attitude  Not that  Look we have to look  At race accurately  But we as Caucasians 
[01:49:30]  Don't comprehend  So because we haven't  Been denied a job  Because of the color  Of our skin  We can't make  A comment on it  Or see it as being accurate  Or seeing it as being  Bullshit at times  It's like  Just because I haven't  Been denied a job  Because of my skin  Doesn't mean that I don't  See occasionally  A black guy using racism  Inappropriately  I should be able  To call that out  Have you ever had sex  With a black woman  Yes  And black trannies  I mean you want to  Go down the line  Who hasn't  What am I  A racist  Yeah of course  Why do you ask  That question Ian  Because Michael Jackson 
[01:50:00]  Believed bringing  Races together  He was  That's what he wanted  To do  He wanted to heal  The world  And he did believe  In interracial  Relationships  Yeah most people  Do after 1955  Most of us  Are kind of fine  With that  As far as the  80's and 90's  Went  As far as  Coming up with  Interracial  Relationships  People walking  Down the street  Would have been  Shot years ago  And now  You don't even  Look twice  It's got better  It's got better  The president  Is a black man 
[01:50:30]  His family  There is a black  Family living  In the White House  They've reached  The pinnacle  Of power  It shows  That if you  Apply yourself  If you assimilate  To this country  And work hard  You can achieve  The greatest office  This nation has  So where is this  Such a  Hardcore racism  That Michael Jackson  Was afraid to say  Oh you know  I like  I don't buy  Your argument here  With all due respect 
[01:51:00]  Because the fact  You make it sound  So easy  That all they have  To do is work hard  They can become  President  And away we go  Let me ask you  When was the last  Time you were  In the Bronx  Here  In the Bronx  Yeah  I drive through  The Bronx  Every so often  Going upstate  I dated a Puerto Rican  She lived by  Webster Avenue  In the Bronx  I was always afraid  To go there  But she's such  Good dick  That I would  Take the chance  There's your answer  There you go  That's a good answer  So you're saying  Like what  I'm from Canada  Here  When people walk  Down the street  Let's say 
[01:51:30]  If you're black  You're white  You can walk down  You know  Interracial  Doesn't matter  Two trannies  Walking down  Nobody  Nobody gives a shit  In Canada  Over here  And the neighborhoods  Are quote unquote  Integrated in Canada  Sure  For years and years  I go to the Bronx here  You know  I feel threatened  Yes  As you should  Yeah  You know  You're talking about  It's a poverty issue  You're talking about  A guy in the White House now  Yeah  But I'm talking about  The big picture 
[01:52:00]  You feel threatened  Because it's a poverty issue  Like honestly  The Bronx is a fucking scary area  Cops are scared of the Bronx sometimes  Yeah  Or Flatbush  Or a lot of areas  A lot of places  There are black guys  That don't want to walk through the Bronx  You walk through the Bronx  With the wrong fucking color  Headband on  You're going to get shot  Yeah  It's a scary area  For a lot of people  Because it's very high  I feel like  I just want to see  Where your blame lies  I'm just a notch  Below Baghdad  Sometimes in the Bronx  So where does your blame lie there  It's not that dangerous  Who are you blaming  That was funny  Who are you blaming  I think the system  I like that  Okay the system  It's a little vague 
[01:52:30]  It's a little vague  I think as  You guys got to wake up  And smell the coffee  There's still a lot  We live here  We don't fly in  And just pontificate it  But we live here  But you are Caucasians  So what?  So what?  So are you?  So are you  So are you  And yet you know  Whose studio is right next door?  That's fucking Shea  That's Eminem's studio  They're all black people in there  We're not shocked  By black people here  But in Canada  Don't put words in my mouth  I didn't say you are  I said we're not shocked  By black people  I didn't put that in your mouth  We have a black president  And everything's hunky-dory  No one said that  But he did say  That your argument 
[01:53:00]  About racism  Is a bit dated  You are making  Kind of like a very liberal  Argument from 1985  I'm not talking  From my words  I'm talking from the words  Of the greatest artist  The greatest entertainer  That's who was loved by white people  What racism did he face?  He's got three white kids  Like all this weird  Racial crossovers he had  And you know what?  He was still loved  And you know what?  He was  I mean fuck McCartney  Out of the Beatles songs  People still loved him  Michael Jackson  Despite the perception  That he was a pedophile  Even after he was acquitted  Because look  I still felt he was  Was I wrong?  Okay maybe I was wrong 
[01:53:30]  He still was beloved  I never saw  A more diverse crowd  Than at his memorial  They loved him  In Harlem  When they showed that  There were white black people  It was just the most diverse crowd  But where was everybody beforehand?  It's easy for everyone  To come celebrate  Where was he beforehand?  When he dies  And a lot of them  He wasn't doing shows  He wasn't doing shows  He wasn't doing shows  What do you expect?  He was hiding for the last time  He was hiding  You're right  Michael Jackson  Four years  If you're saying the memorial  It was completely  It was like a rainbow there 
[01:54:00]  That's what he wanted to accomplish  Some concerts were like that too  That's what he wanted to accomplish  But why didn't he ever come out of it?  Have you ever heard  The Michael Jackson gay rumors before?  Yes of course  But it wasn't  I cannot see that  As a racial issue  I see that as  An issue where  If he says I'm gay  He might think that  He's not going to get  But you're a Caucasian  This is not my words  This is in the words  Of the late  Great  The greatest entertainer  Michael Jackson  Pardon me  You say  That Michael Jackson 
[01:54:30]  And this  I didn't know  This is an interesting fact  In the book  Was diagnosed  When he was a very young boy  With schizophrenia  Right  Was he six years old  So if he was diagnosed  At six years old  With schizophrenia  We obviously know  That he's a little  Mentally unbalanced  He probably  I'm guessing  Had body dysmorphia  Because just of all  The changes he made  To his face  So how can you give him  Complete credibility  With his thoughts on racism  Like that was a perfectly  Rational logical thing  And the other brothers say  He was diagnosed  With schizophrenia  Are you saying  That schizophrenics  Aren't capable  Of having their own opinions  No  Of course they are  Schizophrenia is a huge disease 
[01:55:00]  And it's got to be dealt with  Of course  But how can you not  Take that into context  Joe Jackson  I have a file on Joe Jackson  Like this  And if he keeps going further  Trying to get custody  Of these kids  I'm going to call  A press conference in New York  Why don't you just  Call the press conference  That would be some great  Because I don't want  To dig up the skeleton  Right now  Michael Jackson  I want it to rest in peace  How can you say  In one breath  We hate false threats  How can you say  In one breath  Obviously that he was  Of course he can have  Opinions on race  And some may be very accurate  But how can you not  Take that with a grain of salt  That his opinions  May have been 
[01:55:30]  A little off kilter  Considering the fact  That he did drug  I say that in the book  You haven't read the book  No but I'm asking you  I can only get up  What you're telling me  I say Michael  Spun a lot of tales  There's no doubt about it  So why isn't his view  On race  Why are you taking  His view on race  At face value  And saying it's 100%  Accurate in New York  He said this his whole life  Michael Jackson said  Sometimes he'd  Improvise some lines  To dupe the media  To shield his kids  From the media  But Michael maintained this  Remember this is  Michael Jackson  Of the Jackson 5  A career  That very few have had  No one 
[01:56:00]  I mean you know  The only person  Supporting Michael Jackson  Was Liz Taylor  Another child star  Where were all these people  They all came out  When he died  And pretended they were so  With any celebrity  But he did that to himself  He hid from the world  You know  He had no choice  Ian the gay thing  So what was he into  What was he doing  I was reading some excerpts  And he would sneak out  In women's clothes  Go to seedy hotels  In Vegas  That's funny  Because a lot of people  Said what women's clothes  I have photos of women's clothes  Michael Jackson dressed up 
[01:56:30]  I follow him around  Going in my film  When it comes out  See I have 300 hours  Of footage  And I'm just waiting  For all the detractors  To come out  Like I've done  On all my previous projects  I'm the only guy  To ever infiltrate  The Church of Scientology  By the way  I posed undercover  Last year as a gay actor  They let me film  Non-stop in there  And that's how I found out  About the gay rumors  With Michael Jackson  First  I found out  Through a quote  From his mother  Michael Jackson's mother  Catherine Jackson  Who's getting a lot  Of sympathy  That's unwarranted 
[01:57:00]  From the media  This is a woman  Who stood by  Her husband  While he beat the crap  Out of Michael Jackson  And never said a word  A lot of people would say  I'm not defending her  But a lot of people would say  Hedda Nussbaum  Did the same thing  With Joel Steinberg  Biddy Liza  A lot of people say  The victims of domestic violence  It really is  Like they're the victim too  And I'm not saying  That she was  But it's kind of hard  To attack the mother  On that one  But is this the woman  Who should be  Getting custody  Of these three children  And  No  I don't think so  It doesn't matter  How much longer  Will she live 
[01:57:30]  Well  Joe Jackson  Has come out  And said he wants  To start the Jackson 3  Yeah  Put the kids on stage  You have Debbie Rowe  On the other side  If she'd have the chance  She'd auction these kids  Off to eBay  In a second  Where is an independent  Authority right now  Is there California  Child services  Child welfare  Does that exist  They're treating  The Jackson family  Like saints  Like royalty  You've seen the tributes  You've seen everything  I haven't seen  One bad word 
[01:58:00]  Come out about this guy  I think the kids  Are well taken care of  They'll be just fine  Yeah I think the kids  Will be fine  How can you say that  If they go to the Jacksons  You want to see them  They're in mourning  Right now  He wants to put them  On the stage  Sign them recording  Contracts right now  On the other side  Debbie Rowe  She'll take a buck  For the kids  Which is the most  Disgusting thing  You say how good  The U.N. survey is here  Where's the authorities  To intervene  And get these kids 
[01:58:30]  Stability  People are saying  Didn't Debbie Rowe  Say it wasn't a stipulation  And it's a little too soon  To say where is  The proper place  To go  It's kind of hard  To figure out  Because he wasn't married  So where's the U.S. of A  The U.S. of A  The Jackson kids  Are going to be taken care of  They have not been given  To Joe Jackson  They're not going to be  Taken care of  People are figuring out  Where they legally belong  People are on their  Coattails right now  Trying to get at the will  The money  Which is their  What damage can you prove  Has been done to those  I'm not saying you're even wrong  But you say where's the U.S. of A  Like the government  Is supposed to just step in 
[01:59:00]  And take the children  Specialist Canadian nation  Yes  Exactly  We're working on it  Believe me  We're trying hard  Have you ever been to Canada  Yes I performed to Montreal  At the comedy festival  I've been there many times  My good friend Andy Nolman  Is the CEO of the  Just for Laughs  Do you know Andy Nolman  I don't know Andy Nolman  Andy Nolman was the head  Of Just for Laughs  Did you like Montreal  I like Montreal a lot  Yes I did  In Toronto  I didn't enjoy Montreal  Did you sneak out of the house  In women's clothing  And go to the city hotels  Yes  And the whole line about  How the king of pop  Is going to lick your lollipop  How do you know this shit  I found 
[01:59:30]  After Catherine Jackson  I found the quote  She said  Michael  Her son's a fag  Then I found quotes  From siblings  Accusing him  Of being gay  I never saw the smoking gun  With these people  This was just hearsay  Innuendo  So I decided to go further  Through my key  Two sources  I was put on  To eight people  Eight males  Who claimed  They slept  With Michael Jackson  Including L.A. porn star  Who's gone on the record 
[02:00:00]  I didn't even put him in  Because I could not find  Extreme corroboration  What was his name  If he's gone on the record  I'm not going to say his name  Well if he's gone on the record  I mean if he's on the record  Why not  Google him  Google him  You'll find it  Google who  Why don't you say  Because he's not worth my time  I asked for extreme corroboration  He didn't produce it  Not worth my breath  But the three  Oh shit  Oh someone's getting catty  The three  The three I found  Jimmy Norton  No  The three I found  Provided photos  Timeline  Witnesses  Read the book 
[02:00:30]  It's all in there  But what's wrong  If this was a biography  Of George Michael  We wouldn't even be  Having this conversation  Because nobody would  Really care as much  He was the biggest star  In the world  And he did die  He didn't fade away  I mean people didn't  Expect him to die at 50  And he was making  A big comeback  I said six months  Before he died  He has six months  I'm saying the majority  Where were all you guys  When I said that  I don't know  Probably here working  For being the racist  Pigs that we are  Everybody was sleeping  Why don't you yell  At the mainstream media  For not getting the interview  That Martin Bashir got 
[02:01:00]  I mean come on  You can't say  Where was the media  They sleep on a lot of things  In this country  And in your country too  This is supposed to be  The higher level  Of journalism in the world  It took a Canadian  It took a Canadian  From the woods  To trek on a Greyhound bus  With a video camera  And get the story  It also took a Canadian  On a bus  To cut off someone's head  And fucking hold it up  If you remember  If you want to talk about  Canadians on buses  I got a story my friend  Every time I go on the bus  Now  Every time I go on the bus  I look behind my shoulder  But you had this weird  Like this weird thing  With the US  So instead of shitting  On like the US media 
[02:01:30]  Which I'm with you on that  You obviously did a good job  I love the people here  The people are fantastic  Some of my best friends are here  Hey where's the great media  With Paul and Carla Bernardo  I mean the big media blackout  Where's all the great  Media information  From Canadians on that one  Harumph  Unfortunately you're an expert  On Canadian stuff  I know  You're the only guy  What's the capital of Canada  Oh no  Saskatchewan  Anyone who know  Seriously  Anyone here know  The capital of Canada  I honestly do not know  Come on  I would guess  I rest my case  I rest my case  I think it doesn't matter 
[02:02:00]  Of course it matters  Everyone  Who gives a shit  Every Canadian  I don't know the  Every Canadian  When you ask them  What's the capital here  Because the US  They will respond  Because the US  Is popular  Illiteracy  Is a problem  Illiteracy  Yes it is a problem  In the US  When we were creating  The lightbulb  To read by  Ian  That's my point  You have a Canadian  Reseming  In the US  You are not  The entire world  Step out  See the world  Get educated  I fly everywhere  You cannot even name  The capital of Canada  I don't care about that 
[02:02:30]  I don't give a shit  About that  We are in business  What was the original  Black Sabbath  What was the original  Black Sabbath  I don't care about  Black Sabbath  That's how I feel  About the capital  Who gives a shit  I'll tell you  What's the real name  Exactly  I won't answer any question  About Michael Jackson  Today  But any Canadian  Will name the capital  Because the US  What's the name of my HBO special 
[02:03:00]  What's the name of my HBO special  Dude  You don't know  Because I'm not big enough  For you just to know that  That's the way it is about Canada  We don't look at Canada like that  We are neighbors in business  Canada and the US  I don't even watch television  No no but the point I'm making is  You say how can we not know Canada 
[02:03:30]  You guys are all obsessed here  About celebrity culture  About TV  And you travel  You know what we do in Canada  You travel nations  But you wrote a book about celebrities  Where you're obsessed  We don't sit  You wrote about Colby  Because nobody else here got the story  You wrote about Colby  You wrote about Colby  Celine Dion  Stop it  You can't get enough celebrities  You guys sit on your butts  You got on the bus  I am drinking beer  Eating junk food  We're out cycling  Yeah like Michael Moore  The picture of Canadian health  Stop it  Stop it you silly goose 
[02:04:00]  We have to  Why are you criticizing that film  Because he's fat  I think the film was great  But you're saying that we eat junk food  And I'm saying the fattest fuck  In the fucking north of South America  And by the way  Lock your doors  That's crazy  Just lock your doors  Now Ian we gotta wrap up  But two things  First of all it's Ottawa  We all know that  Second of all  How did  They're gonna  The reports are coming out  Any day now  Michael Jackson  How did he die  I'm not a coroner  I'm not a cop  I'll tell you one thing  An educated guess  How did he die 
[02:04:30]  Let me say one thing  Overdose of  I will not comment  Until this police force  Answers questions  Now  If we look at the track record  Of this police force  It ain't exactly too pretty  Especially in  High profile celebrity cases  True  Hopefully this time  They will get their shit together  And give the proper answers  If they don't  I will be on their trail  Because most likely  You guys won't  So I will get  Thank God we got here  Thank God we got here  I will go back to LA 
[02:05:00]  And I will do due diligence  I'm hoping  You're working for us  I'm hoping  That these guys get it  Right this time  Don't act like you're doing  God's work  Let's be  You're coming off  A little annoying  Because you're an author  Where was everyone else  Where was everybody else  They were talking about  Michael Jackson  They were writing about  Michael Jackson  Stop it  You're saying  You're one of the worst  Celebrity obsessed  You get on a bus  And cross the border  To write about a celebrity  I even gave them the  I even gave them  The smoking gun  I came out  I said he's dying  Six months to live  I was right on  And still  Gene Dixon said that once 
[02:05:30]  Who gives a shit  But I'm not  Nostradamus here  I know you're not  But the fact is  I did my homework  Yes you did  And you should be  That's why you have a book  That would probably go  Number one on the best  I'm hoping  That the rest of the media now  Will follow this case  And we'll get to the bottom of it  Alright but just the pomposity  Of the Caucasians from Canada  Come to rescue the idiots  From the US  Is silly  And it's elitist  And you probably don't mean it to me  But it's inaccurate  Michael Jackson  Alright with Michael Jackson  Schizophrenic  He was also a schizophrenic  Who had a tiny nose 
[02:06:00]  And had a clutch shit put in  Stop acting like all of a sudden  His is the word of a fucking authority  On racism  When that fucking kook  Walked around with a fucking surgical mask  It was nuts  There was only one Jackson  Who helped Michael  In the last ten years of his life  Who Jesse?  That fucking  Pug-eyed cocksucker  But it was Jesse Jackson  Oh yeah he's really  A great  He was there for Michael Jackson  He also offered to pay the tuition  Of a girl  Who lied about being raped  By Duke players  He's a really  A brilliant source  Of inspiration  For all of us  Referred to New York  As Hymeetown  Yes  He also  He also  He was an anti-semitic slur 
[02:06:30]  Referred to New York  As Hymeetown  He fucking knocked up a woman  Out of wedlock  And then trashes  I'm not here  To debate the track record  Of Jesse Jackson  Don't mention him  You brought him up  All I'm saying  Is the only person  The only Jackson  Who showed interest  In Michael's well-being  Reggie Jackson did too  Reggie Jackson almost played  For Montreal  Before the Yankees  Hey  Listen  Until George Steinbrenner  Brought him to New York  And put him down Broadway  Everyone recognized Reggie  In Montreal  That's the resentment 
[02:07:00]  That's the resentment  Charles Brokman  The owner of the Xbox  Wanted Reggie Jackson  But he put him down  St. Catherine Street  Have you ever been to  St. Catherine Street?  I'm sure I have  It's like the Broadway  And no one recognized her  That's the problem  Listen Ian  I think you gotta go  Your publicist is panicking  Let's read the book  Before we rush the judgment  We're not rushing the judgment  We think the book  Is probably very accurate  Thank you all for having me  I hope to see you guys  Again  Ian Halperin  Ian  Unmasked  The final years of Michael Jackson  I want to ask you about Kurt Cobain  Was he murdered?  I'll say one thing  Yeah 
[02:07:30]  The forensic evidence  Proves 100%  Kurt Cobain did not commit suicide  I'll come back here  Anytime you guys want to talk about that  Absolutely  We gotta run  Thank you for having me  Take care  Good luck with the book  Thank you  Ian Halperin  Unmasked  The final years of Michael Jackson  In bookstores and  Amazon.com now  Hi Jen  Good seeing you tonight  Holy shit  She does my bookstore  Holy shit  Danny  Danny was just making  Disgusting faces  I love it  I love it  That guy  And that's how you interview  That guy  Let me tell you something  That is a work 
[02:08:00]  I'm not buying  Everything that  He's trying to sell a book  That's a character  He's putting on  You might be right  Not totally  I'm not saying totally  He is  As Jimmy said  He is a pompous  Caucasian Canadian  With a guilt complex  That thinks he's coming down  To save America  But  He's pouring that fucking  Personality  On to sell books  You might be right  Was I the only one  That kind of liked him  I kind of liked him  I wanted to hate him more  But when I saw 
[02:08:30]  That it was a work  He's playing the heel  He's playing the Canadian heel  I'm like  Alright whatever  What a fucking  With your goofy glasses  What a fucking asshole  I have a wrinkled pink tie  I do think that he believes that though  Because  You know  The thing about  You're not cocaine  I think he does believe that  But the thing is  He's saying shit  He's saying shit  He's being very critical  Of us  Our racism  Our country  And then  The second you question it  And he goes  Not my words  Michael Jackson  Like  No  They just came out of your mouth 
[02:09:00]  Yeah  They were your words  What a douche  Holy shit  I did enjoy that though  Yeah I enjoyed the fuck out of it  Oh Jimmy got some zingers in there  Oof  We just went like an hour and a half  Without breaking  I got a tinkle  We got a tinkle  Jimmy had a wee wee beforehand  Tinkle  My blotters about to explode  And that's why we're the most popular show  In satellite radio  Kenny  That's how you handled that interview  Kenny could you check to make sure  There's no negroes in the restroom  When Jimmy uses it  That's right  You know how we hate to make wee wees  When there's negroes in the bathroom 
[02:09:30]  And tell them not to look at me  From shade 45  I don't want those eyes  On my pure white skin  Exactly  Is their water fountain working  Because ours is working fine  Jesus  I guess we'll be back  By the way  I did lose a job  I lost a job  To a black guy  But I couldn't get a word in edgewise  When I was first on the radio  They said they wanted to hire me  But because they had a quota to fill  At the radio station  They hired the black guy  And that is a fact  Yeah I'm sure it is  That is a fact  So yes  I did lose a job  Because of the color of my skin  It does work the other way 
[02:10:00]  And I'm sure if we went to the phones  There's a bunch of people  That would call and say  Yeah I lost a job  To a black guy  How about the firefighters  In the Supreme Court case  That was just overturned  That silly goose  Yeah  God I love the hell out of that one  Holy shit  Now compare the two shows  You assholes  That was fun  That's how you do that  Opie and Anthony  Gotta say man  I enjoyed the hell out of that last segment  I'm like sitting here  Having to text people  That are just like  They loved it 
[02:10:30]  I kind of  I kind of liked the guy  You would  You would  Nah  It's just  Well yeah  Because he's  Because he was a douche  He was a complete douche  I kind of related to a lot of the douchey things  He was doing  Oh my god  You just want to smack him  At first I hated him  But he kind of turned me around  It's fun to have on there  It's kind of a  You got to think it's kind of a work  I don't know if he believes  He believes half the shit he was spewing  I don't know  I kind of think a bit of a work  A little bit of a work there  A little bit of a work there 
[02:11:00]  He's kind of playing the heel  Because he just went on and on  And pounded the same thing  And then the second you'd confront him  On what he's saying  He'd say  Well Michael Jackson said that  Right  No no  The greatest entertainer of all time  You just said that  Yeah  I think that what he  When he said that now  When he's back to a corner  Hey I didn't say that  The greatest entertainer of all time  I think that he was actually  Being fairly genuine  Because I think  Fairly  What he's playing is  The popular liberal angle 
[02:11:30]  Of people  You don't understand  White people  You don't get it  And I don't know  I don't think he was trying  To be controversial  Maybe he was  But he was fun  He was fun to have on  Oh yeah  You got to give him that  I'll read the book  You know what  He's not a dummy  I will absolutely read that book  He's going to sell  He's going to sell a lot of books  Being like that  Thank God  I think he knows that  Yeah  I think he knows he can be  An asshole  Yeah  And sell a lot of books  Because he  If I recall  He did catch a lot of heat  For the Kurt Cobain books 
[02:12:00]  And his theories on how Kurt died  So he's kind of  I think he's kind of built up  This character  It's based on him  Believe me  I think he is  Truly a liberal  Self-hating  Jewish white guy  From Canada  That has a  An extreme jealousy  Slash resentment  Toward the United States  It's an exaggeration  Of his personality  Right  Yeah  And it comes out  He believes the basic stuff  He was talking about  And then just plays it  I almost saw 
[02:12:30]  A smirk a couple of times  That voice of his  Is just so  Fucking annoying  He is a cheese grater  He is just  Fucking  Were the fans loving him  They hate him  Oh do they hate him  They love this segment  I'm glad somebody picked up  On the fact that  I called him a queer  Dude Sam came in  That was hysterical  And he goes  At one point  Obi-Wan  Hey Iain  Shut up you're queer  You're like  Ian Iain  Ian  Shut up you're queer  I didn't hear it  It's funny  Well because there was  So much noise going on 
[02:13:00]  And he looked up like  Did someone just call me a queer  Queer  And then  The capital of Canada  I blurted out  Who gives a shit  City  Yeah it's who gives a shit  Ville  And then fucking Jimmy  What did you say about  Black Sabbath  What was the original name  Of Black Sabbath  Shut him up  And the guy goes  I don't know  He goes  See because that's not  Part of you  Like Canada  Is a part of me  I can give a shit  There was so much  Going on there  Oh fuck  God  Phew  That was fun  That was good  He's coming back 
[02:13:30]  To discuss  More Michael Jackson  And the death  Of Kurt Cobain  In the near future  Maybe not tomorrow  But maybe early next week  In the future  I think early next week  Before he goes back to LA  When we're all  Living in the racial harmony  That you find in Canada  He'll be back  I'm sure  Wow  My god  Then it brings up  How all Canadians  Are healthy  And we just sit on our ass  And  That was fun  Eat and just do nothing  And it's like  What the fuck  We should just debate  Where does this come from  We should debate  You know America  Merits of America 
[02:14:00]  And Canada  That would be  The fact that  They would have been  Blitzkrieged upon  Time and time again  If it wasn't for  Their neighbor to the south  That has  That spends all its money  We have free health care  We can walk in  Yeah you know why  Because we have to pay  For a fucking military  To protect us  And your sorry ass  And stupid Mexico  And everyone else  In this hemisphere  Against whoever the fuck  Wants to come rolling in  And strolling in  And our Canadian listeners  Our Canadian friends  We start with Mike 
[02:14:30]  They want in on this bad  Mike in Toronto  Go ahead  Holy shit  This guy pissed me off  To no end  But it was a great segment guys  I just want to say  You know you guys  Talked about him  When he was back  Into a corner  And given all the quotes  To Michael Jackson  The problem was  Whenever he was back  Into a corner  He was also throwing out  Well have you talked  To this guy  Yeah yeah  You know he talked  About the Bronx  And he talked about  Being a proud  Canadian  I guarantee you  He hasn't been to  Malvern in Toronto  Or the Asian gang 
[02:15:00]  Communities in East Vancouver  So before he starts  Spewing that shit again  Fuck I want to  Kick this guy in the teeth  Call him out  On some areas in Canada  Where it would be like  Yeah go ahead  Scroll through there  At night  See we don't have  Enough knowledge  Of the Canadian  Hot spots  As far as  Problem areas  Because we don't give a shit  So there are  Problem areas in Toronto  That shit  I had no idea  Because he said  There wasn't  No he said  Everything's fine  This guy gets on there  And he starts  Spewing all kinds of shit  Because you guys  Won't know about it  And he looks like 
[02:15:30]  A friggin genius  When in reality  He's just spewing bullshit  But the Canadian  Version of the FCC  Their hot trigger button  Is race  So I really do believe  He believes that  Because with them  It's racial humor  And that's such an  To believe that black people  Have been fucked over  In this country  Is very accurate  And to leave them  Had a very shitty time  For a very long time  You can't deny that  And you can't deny  That things have been unequal  And in a lot of ways  Are unequal  But there's a line  Between that  And groveling  Pandering 
[02:16:00]  Which I think  Is a sign of somebody  Being elitist  Yeah  And intellectually superior  They need our help  Yeah  So let's help them  In a non-common sense way  In an elitist way  Oh my god  And like no one  No one's ever been successful  Coming out of  The slums  The Bronx  East New York  And Brooklyn  Look who they're fucking  Putting in the Supreme Court  Exactly  No one's been successful  Coming out of these areas  You know how?  By exactly what I said  Assimilation 
[02:16:30]  To the society  That this country has  Hard work  Staying away from  People  And things that are  Going to get you in trouble  That's what does it  He's on  Look at him  He's on  There he is  We're watching him right now  Can we get  On a news show  Wait I gotta hear him on TV  Pot that up  I'm kicking it up  With his fucking ass  I gotta hear that  Can we get this real fast  What you're talking about  We're gonna try  Here we go  Go  I got

[02:18:00]  And get Michael  Into a hospital  With a world class doctor  What did they do instead?

[02:47:00]  Alright  Sam you gotta  It's full of  You're close  It's like full of cum  You got a new backstage I see  Yeah  Backstage  Oh my god  It tastes great  Does it  It's like when you take the chocolate off the yodel  And then just eat the yodel  Perfect  Without the chocolate on it  Backstage with ONA  Shit I could eat like half this maybe  Danny Bombs  Again  What do you mean again?  Well  Technically backstage with ONA Danny Bombs 
[02:47:30]  Was done about a month ago  So this is backstage with ONA Danny Bombs again  Oh wow  The last time he bombed  Did you talk to Danny in this?  Oh yeah  Yeah we got  And now backstage with ONA  Here is Primetime Sam Roberts  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts  And on a recent O.B. and Anthony show  Producer Danny made a joke  That was received so unbelievably poorly  It had to be heard to believe  She wanted Austin Powers 
[02:48:00]  Instead she got Ed Powers  Ta-da  Danny was  We went to ONA staff members  Travis and Iraq  To get their take on Danny's terrible line  Travis  You were there today  When Danny had another  Colossal bomb  In terms of a very  A joke that was  Not at all funny  And nobody laughed at  What do you think went wrong  For Danny?  You know how they call Danny 
[02:48:30]  The king of the internet?  Yes  Danny should probably stick to  Doing internet searches  Oh like silent Google searches  Yeah yeah pretty much  You know like I'm  I'm kind of like a silent partner  On the O.B. and Anthony show  You're more of a vocal partner  Yeah  Danny wants to be  More of a vocal partner  But he should stick to  The silent end of this  Yeah you know  He should follow my lead  Instead of yours  Hey E-Rock  Did you hear Danny bomb today?  Oh yes I did  What do you think went wrong for him?  Because his joke was met with  Just a huge amount of silence  Besides being an obscure reference 
[02:49:00]  It's not his show  So him jumping in  Didn't really help  Now would you consider Danny  When you're thinking of words  To describe Danny  Would funny be one of them?  I'd say he tries  Oh wow  That's  I get what you're doing there  Trying to be diplomatic about it  No realness or resentment there  Huh E-Rock  After his catastrophic bomb  We figured Danny  Would have quit the business  Of radio altogether  But as luck would have it  He was in the O&A office  Where we reached him for comment 
[02:49:30]  So Danny  What went wrong today on the air?  Another bomb  Yeah I don't know man  Those guys are just not  Pulling off the show they used to  No I wasn't talking about them  I was talking about  I think you're a lot better  At Eddie W if you ask me  But I mean  I was talking about  Your specific joke  About Ed Powers  That was good  Nobody laughed  Yeah but it was still a good joke  Is it  What does it feel like  When you say something like that  And you just are met  With such silence  It doesn't feel very good 
[02:50:00]  You feel very hot and tingly  And your armpits start sweating  Pretty quick  I never knew you could actually  Start sweating that quickly  Without moving  I feel like you should be doing more  To avoid situations like that  Because lately they've been coming up  More and more frequently  How come you take the news so poorly  When your jokes don't go well?  How does anybody take news like that?  You just don't seem to respond  To criticism well  Well as Anthony said  When the cock's in your mouth 
[02:50:30]  You try to spit it out  Instead of just giving it  A little suck  I suck the cock  I suck it  You know that is something  That can be used out of context  I don't understand  As Danny does a poor job  Of pretending to be good natured  About the whole thing  We can only guess  How bad his meltdown will be  After his next bomb  Fortunately for us  We probably won't have to wait  Very long to see it  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts  And this has been  Backstage with ONA  Nice  Damn 
[02:51:00]  Very good  Boy that was harsh though  Like Travis's take on the whole thing  Was a little harsh  A little uh  A little resentment there  Not only that  Not only that  But I don't think  I appreciate you saying  I'm like a behind the scenes  Partner  A silent partner  A backstage partner  The word fucking partner  Where did that come from?  Yeah  You could barely use that  In your marriage  Partner  Yeah  How about you're a silent albatross  Yeah  I'm an entity  Yeah like an anchor 
[02:51:30]  Exactly you're a silent burden  Yeah  The way he just threw the word  Partner out there  That was a little  A little  I've been here four years  Oh four years makes you a partner?  In how long we've fucking been here?  It's Opiate Anthony featuring  Little Jimmy Norton and Travis  No  I'm a silent partner  I wouldn't  Partner?  You know how many partners we've had  After four years  Have just disappeared  Never to be heard from again?  There you go  Now you got me 
[02:52:00]  For now  For now  For now  He'll be on the list eventually  There'll be another guy that we go  Oh remember that guy?  Holy shit  Oh my god  I just had a baby  What was his name?  Trevor with a T  What?  Some of the T  Trevor  Oh  I think Trevor or something like that  You had a wife Linda  What?  Remember that time you had a baby  And then we fired him two months later?  Yeah  Yeah  Fired  Destitute  Please don't fire  The baby ended up on like  The lunch line 
[02:52:30]  With the little coupons  And scroll  We ruined his life  What happened?  Dad  I have no talent  Daddy  Partner  Yeah  Sure he is  Why is my baby Asian?  No that's baby talk  Daddy  Partner  And why is your baby Asian?  Daddy  A partner  Is Asian  Why fucking Asian?  Oh shit  Oh shit  Oh damn  No damn  He didn't  I was wondering where you went Sam 
[02:53:00]  Oh damn  He was impregnating that girl  Abigail  Abigail  We have a new episode of Jim C  After the break  Oh no  Jim C investigates Michael Jackson's death  On the way in a few minutes here  Wow  Yes  And Jimmy  Because I know you're going to ask me  As soon as the mics go off  We get it  You're angry  It's coming in a lot  So we did our job  Ah good 
[02:53:30]  We were trying to make a point there  And I think we made it  I think people got it  Yeah  Angry all the time  Even on his birthday  We get it  Just angry  Both of them just stayed in character  Right  What kind of cupcakes are these?  Well these are  What kind of cupcakes?  Really just say  Even characters have opinions  They come in here  And it just turns into  A horrible college radio  It really is  It's very funny  Everybody wants to do well  Yeah I know 
[02:54:00]  They overdo it  Some people say they're partners  Just eat your cupcake and shut up  This might be the best cupcake I've ever had  Might be the last one you have in this studio  Why was it being a silent partner?  Yeah  That's true  Mr. On Mic  That's a good point  Okay  Hit the brake will ya?  That's what you do  Yeah you're the brake hitter  What else is going on out there? 
[02:54:30]  Man arrested for having sex with dog  Witness says dog was making an awful sound  Oh god  Is it like the chicken?  Damn  We have that fucking dog  Right  California tax officials  Legal pot would rake in  1.4 billion dollars  1.4 bill  Just legalized the pot already  Nah  Wow look at this guy  Looks like he could be one of our listeners  That had the sex with the dog 
[02:55:00]  I hate to say  Oh that's the guy?  West Virginia man  Was arrested Thursday  After allegedly breaking into a Farmington home  And having sex with the dog inside  He wanted that dog so bad  He broke into someone's home  Broke into the house?  What the  You can't find just a stray?  What the fuck?  Chris coming to fuck someone's dog?  Do you keep the dog after that?  That's a really good question  Now you're petting it  Did he fucking make it lick his dick?  And then you're fucking  Oh that's a great question 
[02:55:30]  Give me kisses  Give me kisses  Do you want a damaged dog after that?  Yeah do you want a dog that's been fucked?  It's bad enough when you get a dog that was hit by the previous owner  Yeah yeah  They get a little weird  Christopher Bagwell  Christopher Bagwell  26 of Mannington  Bagwell  Broke into a home on July 8th  While the homeowner  It always works out that way though  Yeah  While the homeowner was at work  According to a friend  The friend had stopped to drop off some of the owner's possessions  She said she looked into the house  And saw Bagwell having sex with the homeowner's dog  A male Australian shepherd 
[02:56:00]  Bore collie mix  So I guess he was doing this a lot  He was doing it in the ass  So he would wait for this person to go to work  And then he would just violate the dog  And I guess the homeowner had no idea for a while  I think your dick just smells like dog shit  Dog shit on your dick  It's bad enough on your shoe  No one likes it on their shoe  No  I got it on my dick  His pants were down around his ankles  And the dog was making an awful sound  According to the complaint  Yeah 
[02:56:30]  The woman said  She called Bagwell  A sick bastard  And he let go of the dog  The dog jumped off the chair  And ran over towards the love seat  According to the complaint  Love seat  Yeah exactly  At that time  Chris started towards her  Pulling his pants up  The woman ran from the house  And alerted Farmington's lone police officer  There's only one police officer in that town  Sheriff  He also went through the gun cabinet  According to the complaint  Well you gotta hold a gun to the dog  He's not gonna take it seriously  Bagwell is charged with nighttime burglary 
[02:57:00]  And animal cruelty  He is free on bond  There you go  Damn  That's a sick fuck  That's crazy white guy crime  Oh absolutely  Fucking a guy's dog  Absolutely  All right  I like this one  I remember this wild chick  Maury's having  Some of their wildest guests come back  And this is one of those chicks that like  I fucked 300 men  Those are great  And the mother just cries  As she hears the horrible sexy stories

[02:59:00]  Oh yes I would like to  I want to hear what happened with Jim C  Episode number two  They're naming the episodes now  In case you're collecting them at home  On an all new Jim C.M.E.  Jim C. investigates the mysteries  Surrounding the death of the King of Pop  There's no way he could have injected himself  With a morphine drip  He was too sick Sam  Jim C. soon realizes  That there is more to this case  Than meets the eye  Detective Monahan should investigate 
[02:59:30]  All the insurance policies taken out  By LaToya  And the other androgynous things  That were his brothers slash sisters  Could an old friend hold the key  To unlock this case?  There was a girl  Abigail  Michael would borrow her underpants  She was in great danger  Debbie Rowe told me  While she was shoving cheeseburgers into her face  A sensitive  Somber Jim C.  Puts his reputation on the line  That thin-nosed, fake-chinned, mixed-up racially creep 
[03:00:00]  Was mood  Find out the truth  On an all new Jim C.M.E.  Tonight at 8  I have to go get stitches  Because I lost a card game  And Detective Monahan  Put his wiener in my backside  The music's much better  Than episode one  And I like how it ends  With the Quincy music  And a great little stinger  Of Detective Monahan  Finally fucking you in the ass  Yeah  But he brutalized Quincy's ass 
[03:00:30]  To the point where he had to go to the hospital  And get stitches  Because of a card game  Ouch  Ouch  Why would Monahan accept that?  Like if Quincy had no money  And he goes  You're going to fuck me in the ass  Detective  Why would Detective Monahan  All right, Quince  You're on, Quince  I'll take that bet  Double or nothing  Yeah, double or nothing  That's my ass to mouth  Usually I make you go in the reverse order  Jim C rules  Yeah  Jim C 
[03:01:00]  We got some of those  WWE packages to give away  Before we get the fuck out of here  What's the slug line?  Got a little slug line  But if you're a WWE fan  Just start calling now  We got some prize packages  That contain some really good shit  WWE shit  Oof  Yeah  As we just sit and stare at each other 
[03:01:30]  Kind of  We're spent  I think we did it today  I gotta get on that big silver airship  Yeah, Jimmy's gotta go  Go zipping through the sky  On an aerial plane  Yes  That big silver ship  Newfangled flying machine  Big silver ship  Big silver bird  Mm-hmm  The best classic in current wrestling  From the world's largest wrestling library  To subscribe  Call 1-888-WWE-CLASSICS  How many prize packages will we give away? 
[03:02:00]  All of them?  Three?  We got three left  Let's do two today  And we'll do one last one for tomorrow  Hell fucking no  Let's give out all three today  Are you sure?  Because, I mean, WWE's a great sponsor  And, I mean, we'd love for them to be a sponsor in the future  So we should save one for tomorrow  So they get a nice mention  Yeah  For this thing they're doing  Yeah  1-888-WWE-CLASSICS  I mean, I know you just said it  But it really is the best classic in current wrestling  From the world's largest wrestling library  I would actually check that out  I like old school wrestling  You'll never guess 
[03:02:30]  But Sam is a huge fan of the WWE classics  So much so that he DVRs just about everything  I think he told me that he has a cable box  That's just dedicated to recording stuff from WWE  You guys have no idea  He continues to tape every fucking wrestling show to this day  Does he watch them?  It would be impossible  If he has so many  Here comes Sam running  It's unbelievable  His girl gets really mad  Because the DVR is completely filled up all the time with wrestling  Wrestling shows  She has no room for her shit 
[03:03:00]  Sam  Hi  I'm Sam  Hi Sam  That's not my voice for the record for the audience  What are you going to do with all these tapes?  Do you watch all these tapes?  Because you can't watch all of them  Well, no, I can't physically watch all of them  Especially because then I'd miss the stuff that's going on now  I don't know  But I get really anxious  Like, I get this  Because there are times when I'll forget to DVR an episode 
[03:03:30]  Because you have to do it individually  Because like, Raw will go until 11.07  So if you set your DVR to tape Raw every week  It'll tape to like 11.05  And you'll miss the last two minutes  And the last two minutes could be the best of the whole show  Well, it doesn't even matter  Like, I feel like I don't even want to tape it  But Sam, in this day and age  What are you going to do with all these tapes?  It's an OCD he has  It has to be  Do you get freaked out if you don't tape one?  Yeah, I get really like  Why?  What does it matter?  I'm like a Friday night if I'm out  And it's like 7.45  And I realize Smackdown's on at 8  And I haven't DVR'd it 
[03:04:00]  Don't you have a backup plan though?  Someone that could probably  No one knew your mommy  You'd call mommy and she'll DVR  I would  But the DVD recorder is connected to my DVR at home  And the whole point of DVRing every episode  Is so I can record them on the DVD and keep them  But the thing is  It's so available now online  They're all so easy to get  Yeah, but they're not DVD quality online  They're not like  Wait, so you need DVD quality besides just having it? 
[03:04:30]  Well, I need to like be able to put it into my TV and watch it  I don't want to watch it online  What are you going to do with all this eventually?  Well, I'd like to be able to sit  And read about a match somewhere  And say, you know, oh, I have that  If I want to watch it  Do you like a little thing you write down?  Who was on what episode?  I did at a time  I don't anymore  How do you know who was on what episode?  Yeah, how  Because, well, I'll Google  Or look up  Like I know where to go to look up  The match listings for different shows  So if something  If I'll think of a match  I'll say, when was that match? 
[03:05:00]  I'll find out the date  And then I'll find the DVD  And then I'll go through and find the segment  And just check it out  It's the worst thing I can imagine  It's not a matter of watching every single episode  It's a matter of having everything  So I can watch whatever I want  Right  That's why I love the classics on demand thing  Because it's got everything that I had like on grainy tapes  So now I can watch in full quality  Oh, so you're illegally taping  No, I said now I can watch  I didn't say I tape classic on demand  I didn't say that  So you realize that you wasted all those hours  On your grainy DVD 
[03:05:30]  Right  Your videos  So now you can just watch them  No, no, no  It's not a waste  And you're not  You're not  You're not  Getting rid of your grainy  No, obviously  For crystal clear copies  I'm not getting rid of the tapes  Because  Yeah, you wouldn't do that, right?  The tapes are taped as  As they were on television  Without any like, you know  Did you get the expressed written consent  Of World Wrestling Entertainment  To tape those?  I can record stuff for my own personal private use  But what about when you get the pay-per-views  And then charge everybody to come over and watch it? 
[03:06:00]  No, no, no, no  I don't have friends that come over and watch my pay-per-views with me  You just told me about it the other day  First of all, I would never invite you to my house  That's how you know you're lying  Oh, why wouldn't you invite Danny to your house?  Danny is a co-worker, not a friend  We wouldn't have a relationship outside of the office  You come to my house?  I don't want to come to your house  We're not friends  Come on, play video games  It's harsh  Why don't you want to be friends with Danny?  Well, number one, he accused me of illegal activities on a nationally broadcasted radio show  That's one reason  You don't have to have people come over and watch pay-per-view and charge them? 
[03:06:30]  You can't charge people  No, you can't  I got the big invite  No, I didn't invite you to my house  Sure, I'll bring the invite in  Can I come over and play PlayStation 3 on your CRT tube television?  First of all, you know, CRT tube, you're going over people's heads  Let's talk to the audience  I'm so sick of watching stuff in HD, I want to watch stuff out  Danny thinks it's really funny  You have a tube TV?  I have SD television  No, you have a tube television  Standard definition  Do you have a square TV still? 
[03:07:00]  Oh, yes, it's square  It's a tube  It's very heavy  Square TV, man  Get rid of it  And with what?  I need the TV  Why don't you show up some fucking courage and go get the TV from this office out of fat tits and take that off?  And it does  That's the one  That's the only reason I want HD TV  Is because now they have Raw  And the pay-per-views  WWE puts them on in HD now  I feel like I'm missing something  You are  Really? 
[03:07:30]  Hey, I'm distracted  Is something wrong with the feed again?  Not that I've heard of  Dude, it's going back to the beginning of the Jimsy promo for the third time in a row now  It cuts off after  Why would  Monahan, Static  Then plays the whole promo again  No  God, that guy's listening to  We're on the air, I mean  Okay, I just had to make sure  It's a little weird  You've got to get rid of this obsession  Yeah, right, okay  It's not happening?  No, it's not going to happen  Why would I have  Because then 
[03:08:00]  If I just stopped  I would have a collection  That would just  Stop  My obsession was with baseball cards  I had to have  Like a complete  You know  But at least  Series or whatever  And then  One day I just grew out of it  But with baseball cards  I could give a shit  But at least you had the sets  Like, because they are limited sets  So you could say  I'm stopping after this set  Yeah, but one year  I just said  Alright, what am I doing?  This is dumb  But you still had the complete sets  From the years that you were collecting  Yeah, but I don't care  I don't even know where my baseball cards are  But it doesn't stop  Neither do baseball  Baseball doesn't stop either  But baseball cards are specific collections 
[03:08:30]  For every year  And you can have the specific collection  From any given year  Like 1991  You can have that specific collection  Yeah, but then I could watch  The last episode of Raw from 1990  Or, you know, whatever  There was no Raw in 91  That's silly  But the last show from 91  And I'll say  Tune in next week for this  But this is taking my life  And I'll watch it and say  It's not taking over  It's been my life for a long time  It's like  How often do you have sex?  Probably  I mean, I have two times a week 
[03:09:00]  You know, with the schedule  It's a little difficult  But  I mean, I'm very tired at night  I don't nap during the day  Oh, boy  You have a tough time getting boners?  I know, I do  I'm tired  Not after some WWE team  Okay  How many times does your chick have sex?  I would hope  Just about the same number  You hope, right?  Yeah  But she has  She has had to turn the TV off  In the past  When that has come up  I can't picture Sam being sexual  Wrestling has been on  I can't picture him being aggressive 
[03:09:30]  No, not at all  Well, I mean  I learned some things from watching wrestling  I know how to be aggressive  For some reason  Whenever you fuck  I can picture it  It looks like you're being molested as a child  I'm just blushing  You're just shy  And you pull your shirt up over your face  And keep it there  Well, I don't do that  Are you a bottom?  No, I'm not a bottom  In your own relationship  No  Does she just take charge?  No, she doesn't take charge  With whips and chains  And  She's very satisfied  Strap-ons 
[03:10:00]  There's no strap-ons  There's chains  There's black fists  There's nothing  No  What's your favorite position of sex in?  Missionary  I mean, very regular  I like missionary too  With all the wrestling moves you know  That's the best you can do  With your trick  Well, I mean  It's not wrestling  You can incorporate some of those wrestling moves  Into your sex life  It's fun to go off a little bit  And do some stuff  But missionary  You've never done the pile driver?  Pretty good  The tombstone?  Yeah, you should be doing some tombstoning 
[03:10:30]  The old jackknife power box  Sure  They don't combine  Professional wrestling with my sex life  That's weird  Try one of the wrestling moves  Yeah, give her a razor's edge later  She'd be so freaked out  You talk dirty?  When you're fucking?  No, I'm pretty quiet  Give her the people's penis  Give her the old stick face  Right  Give her  Give her  What was Mr. Ass's  The fame-asser?  Yeah, the fame-asser  Give her a fame-asser  Make her buff your ass  Right  She'd be really creeped out 
[03:11:00]  If I started bringing wrestling  Into that aspect  Before you poke her in the pink  Give her the fame-asser  The fame-asser  I don't think so  I might play this song though  Sam  Yeah  Just for the show  Can you do a wrestling move?  Yeah  Or somehow incorporate it into the bedroom  And then come back and give us a report  You can pick any wrestling move  And just somehow figure out how it works sexually  Can I just do like a reference?  Like this is like the time Triple H had the rock pinned  Or something like that  That's fine too  That's pretty good 
[03:11:30]  Okay  That's fucking awful  I kind of like if he actually came up with a finishing move  Yeah  Okay  Think of a finishing move that you can incorporate into the bedroom  And come back and report to us  Greg Valentine's figure four clitlock  Alright  Yeah, and I'll shout out the name of the move while I'm doing it  There you go  Turn her on  Alright  Someone just completely took me out of the show  What happened?  Gave me a link to a website  What is it?  DWClassics.com 
[03:12:00]  No  No  It's um  Wonderama.com  Motherless.com  Yeah  Ah, daddy knows about that one  Motherless.com  Hey, whatever  I'm just fucking looking  I gotta go  Jesus Christ  Jimmy's gotta go  I gotta take a big silver plane ride  Fucking  You enjoy that website  I gotta go  Thanks guys  Thanks Sam  You're welcome  Oh god  You will do that  That might be  That might be a little questionable  I wouldn't go near that one  Hey, if it's on the fucking web 
[03:12:30]  Why isn't it shut down?  That's an excellent argument in court  That's exactly what  Yeah  It was there, your honor  That's exactly what Pete Townsend said  Yeah  Alright  I gotta go see  Jesus  Bladder for two seconds and hit the bricks  I'll see you guys on Monday  I'm following you out  I'll be older  I'll be 41 by then  No  What's your birthday?
