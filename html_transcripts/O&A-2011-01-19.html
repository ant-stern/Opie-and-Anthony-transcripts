<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton’s self-deprecating introductions, acknowledging their controversial past and the show's often crude and sexually explicit content.  A pre-recorded intro by Stacey Keech followed, which the hosts praised.  The main discussion started with Ed Asner's 9/11 conspiracy theories from an Adam Carolla podcast, prompting vulgar and sarcastic reactions from the hosts, along with a debate about the World Trade Center towers' collapse.  This segued into various topics: a video of cars sliding on ice, aging celebrities (Regis Philbin, Betty White, James Earl Jones, Dolly Parton), the hosts' dating preferences for younger women, the decline of animated sitcoms like *The Simpsons* (including a reference to a "lemon party" episode) and *Family Guy*, and a personal account of one host narrowly avoiding being on a 9/11 flight and the resulting psychological impact.  The segment ended with a promotion for "Most Embarrassing Tape Day," featuring staff submissions, and reminiscing about their past musical endeavors and the Long Island music scene.  The hosts used profanity frequently and discussed sexually suggestive topics throughout.

"Most Embarrassing Tape Day" dominated the next segment.  Staff submissions were the focus, with recollections of Long Island bands like Ryan Starr, Eddie Money, Busta Rhymes, Vanilla Fudge, Art Garfunkel, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Blue Öyster Cult, Soft White Underbelly, Taken Back Sunday, and Mariah Carey.  Anthony discussed an embarrassing power ballad from his old band about an obscure girl’s name.  A significant portion involved a cringeworthy drunk driving PSA recorded years prior by Travis, which won an award and consisted of a melodramatic poem about a fatal accident where he repeatedly called out for his mother.  Troy, a new staff member, shared a 1996 rap song from his high school band "Cornered."  The segment included a lengthy discussion on Camden, New Jersey's police and fire department layoffs, fueled by listener calls and a caller mentioning "It’s Our Time Now" t-shirts among Camden criminals. Anthony's past relationship with a news anchor, Jill, and a fetish photoshoot with Nadya Suleman ("Octomom") were also briefly mentioned.

The "Most Embarrassing Tape Day" segment continued with discussions of medieval torture devices (rat torture and Judas cradle),  and the merits of iPhones and iPads. Eric shared his recent Philly cheesesteak indulgence.  Iraq (using his last name, "Nagle," on air) played a tape of his unauthorized 1996 radio debut, which the hosts criticized. Roland showed a 2003 video from Carson Daly's show highlighting his significant weight loss, while technical difficulties initially hampered the audio. His Aspen comedy festival trip was also shown.  Sam's submission was a rap song from his college band "Junior Mint," featuring nonsensical lyrics and an awkward performance.  Bobo's pre-recorded farewell message and a call for replacements were also included, alongside further discussion of the tapes and China's economic impact on the US.

The final segment of "Most Embarrassing Tape Day" detailed Sam’s awful rap song about a plumber, lawn gnome, and bus driver.  His extreme embarrassment was palpable.  Opie's old promotional videos and audition tapes (Coca-Cola commercial and Midway Airlines appearance) were played and mocked.  A phone call with Sam's mother ("Bobby"), who was unaware of his rap career, ensued, resulting in comedic exchanges and a promise of apple pie for the hosts.  The segment concluded with more discussion of the embarrassing tapes and reactions to Sam's rap, featuring highly vulgar language, racial slurs, and homophobic epithets.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for the cringe style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  Oh, shit. This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love. That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls. 
[00:01:00]  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die.  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Once again, Stacey Keech with the intro.  Thank you.  Isn't that great?  That thing is getting rave reviews.  Holy crap.  And then you get our voices. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, hi.  Good morning.  Our weak little voices.  Hello, everybody.  Good morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll never get a phone call to do a cartoon voice, right?  Not the Stacey Keech voiceovers.  Hell, no.  Those things are great.  I remember him from a little show in the 70s called Karib.  Karib.  He talked about Karib.  Did he talk about Karib?  Oh, you weren't here when he was in?  That's right.  Yeah.  He talked about the Karib.  Karib.  It was him in the Caribbean.  I think he joked about it, right? 
[00:02:00]  I don't think he thought that was one of his better projects.  Really?  Did anyone remember it?  No.  Like, oh, Karib.  We talked about Mike Hammer.  Mike Hammer.  That was a good one, too.  And his new show, Lights Out.  Lights Out.  That's all we know.  And a little up in smoke.  That's right.  We did the basics with the Stacey Keech interview.  He was a genius in up in smoke.  It endeared him with the younger crowd.  He certainly was no George Wendt.  Well.  I want another shot at George Wendt.  Or Lou Grant. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, I like Lou.  Oh, please.  He hated you.  I love Lou.  I wanted him to hate me.  He was such a smug asshole that day.  Job well done.  Well, I've adjusted.  Because at AEW, I used to just go after everyone.  And then me and you realized, oh, fuck.  No one wants to do our show.  No one wants to come on.  So now I pick my spots.  Yeah.  And he deserved the beating he got in Vegas.  Or L.A., wherever the fuck you are.  He was a lovely man.  Lou?  Yeah.  Lou was an asshole.  Oh, he was very nice.  And Lou believes in some 9-11 crap. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Hey, we never played that disc.  If E-Rock could find that, I think he took it back.  But he does.  He believes in that shit.  He was on Adam Carolla's podcast.  And yeah, he's a truther.  Well, good thing.  Good old Lou.  Lou's a truther.  He keeps us gatekeepers in check.  You think he's liberal?  Just a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, is he?  He's operating on the one-yard line.  He definitely is.  I'm obsessed with that. 
[00:03:30]  Because Chris Matthews said he operates on the 40.  40.  He's just to the left.  He's so full of shit.  So if he's just to the left, then a Lou Grant is on the goal line, I guess, trying to punch it in.  He doesn't operate on the 40.  Too bad there's not a 70.  Yeah.  He's not on the 40, Chris Matthews.  He's lying.  He told me he operates on the 40, so I believe him.  40.  Please.  You want to hear Ed Asner?  I mean, I'd love to.  I don't know what the fuck we're going to start doing on the show today, so we might as well. 
[00:04:00]  I like hearing Ed Asner talk about this horse shit.  From the Adam Carolla podcast.  We've been meaning to play this for a while, and here you go.  Ed says he thinks 9-11 was a conspiracy.  Ed, what do you think?  You're going to get him started?  Uh-oh.  You're going to get him started on the 9-11 stuff.  Not what you're in the building?  What's going on?  Conspiracy?  Really?  What's up, Ed?  What do you know?  Go ahead.  No, I just believe it.  Huh.  What's the conspiracy part?  What's the conspiracy part? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, I mean, that you believe it.  Matt, you want to go out in the parking lot and put your head on the pillow?  He did it to go to war?  Is that what you're saying?  I mean, these are all facts which are out there.  People will only take the time to stop them.  Let's hear it.  Rob Schneider said, Ed, I thought you'd know better.  But I don't think he's examined it by any means, and so I preach it.  Let's hear it.  No high-rise has ever gone down by fire. 
[00:05:00]  I love that gag.  Those buildings fell at the rate of gravity in 10 seconds flat.  Or close to it.  Can we do a speed round, though, please?  It's just all of this.  My listeners have heard this over and over again.  I know, I know.  But the speed round.  It's all the same shit.  Debunk that really fast in less than a minute.  No high-rise has ever been brought down by fire.  How about a high-rise that was completely based on steel and its structural integrity  and the fact that the fire was hot enough to soften it, not melt it into liquid. 
[00:05:30]  It didn't turn into fucking Terminator 2.  But it was soft enough where it buckled, the weight of the building itself brought the building down.  And that fathead, Rosie O'Donnell, believes the same shit.  Of course.  Fire can't, she said, fire can't melt metal.  It's like, how do you think they make metal, you dumb fatty?  They use fire to melt it and then form it into fucking stygians and shit.  Fire can melt anything.  Of course it can.  Fire can melt anything.  Yes. 
[00:06:00]  How about the sun?  Do you think the sun can melt?  The sun has fire all over it.  The sun's on fire.  Very good.  All right, Ed Asner moves on.  I like the way this guy thinks.  And did he serve in the military?  The Civil War.  He's Boo Grant.  I hate Lou Grant now.  Oh, he's all right.  He's just old.  He sounds so old.  He does.  He's just out of touch.  He's funny to him.  And he's quoting every one of these already been debunked 800 times facts. 
[00:06:30]  Whoa, he wasn't funny on MTM.  Maritime Mornings sure he was.  Oh, yeah.  He was more of a straight guy there, wasn't he?  No, he was great.  Ted Knight was hilarious.  Yes.  He had some great...  He asked him as hilarious.  Yes.  But the way he would dismiss Ted and shit was hysterical.  Yeah.  He'd pull that whiskey bottle out of his desk drawer and just let Mary ramble on about an  idea and then just tell her no and have a walk out of the office.  Dude, he was hilarious.  He was really funny in that.  Hey, girl, you're spunky.  Thank you.  I hate spunk.  I hate spunk. 
[00:07:00]  I might have to go back and watch the MTM.  Yeah, he was great.  Murray was the one who had nothing.  He threw out an occasional stupid line and he gave him a cloud and shit.  Murray was just the, yeah, the proverbial straight guy, the other guy they needed in  the room.  And Rhoda.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, this video is doing well, man.  Somebody filmed...  It's all over the place.  You'll find...  Maybe I'll tweet it.  Oh, look out.  This fucking...  I think it's outside Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh, very, very steep little side street that I guess people use in the morning 
[00:07:30]  to commute.  Packed with ice.  Packed with ice.  And somebody just sat there with a camera watching one dummy after another go over the  top of this hill, realizing it's a sheet of ice.  And then just sliding all the way down the hill.  Look at this guy.  He's trying to put a cone up.  He's trying to put a cone up.  That's a good idea.  So other people won't go down the road.  Those are some...  Those are always great pieces of footage.  I love watching sliding cars.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know why for hours.  I have like an inner conflict watching that.  Like one part of me wants to laugh like really hard. 
[00:08:00]  But then the other part of me wants to say, what a fucking asshole.  Go out there and fucking help these people.  Stand on the apex of the hill and be like, no, no, no.  It's ice.  Fuck that.  Getting some good vid.  The guy filming was definitely way too far away because he zoomed out and he is...  You could see.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then they showed a guy trying to get up the hill and he's just sliding backwards.  I think he finally got up there to basically say, stop coming down this fucking hill.  All right, back to Ed Asner from the Adam Carolla podcast, 9-11 truther, Ed Asner.  Here's Ed as somebody who's done a little bit of that. 
[00:08:30]  I don't want to take away...  No, go ahead.  No, no, no.  No, this is it from me.  This is good.  And I just want to see Matt squirm anyway.  No, seriously, because here's how I know it to have happened.  The I-beams that this thing is built of, they put fire-retardant material on these I-beams.  If you go into an underground parking structure and you look up, you see something that looks  like it's had acoustic cottage cheese stuff blown all over it.  Well, that's fire-retardant because steel does melt at a fairly low temperature and they put fire. 
[00:09:00]  Now, I had heard, Ed, that when the impact of the plane knocked a lot of that stuff off  of these beams and then when the Jet-A fuel started burning, the beams melted.  But to that, you would say what?  Bullshit.  Really?  Well, then who's behind it then?  We'll never know from the type of investigation.  Who do you think is behind it?  I think that there is a certain area of government which probably participated in this. 
[00:09:30]  Participated in what way?  Turn a blind eye or actually participated?  Well, I mean, in a more proactive way.  The planes couldn't have brought them down by themselves.  So you're saying that there were explosives in the buildings.  Why did Building 7 come down?  You mean the one that was not one of the World Trade.  A hundred yards away from the Twin Towers.  That one came down as well.  Well, why would that one come down?  Well, I don't know.  But, I mean, they put explosives in that one? 
[00:10:00]  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, 300 feet away is not that big when you're talking.  He said a thousand yards, isn't he?  I think he said a hundred yards.  He said a hundred yards.  Yeah, 300 feet.  Not that far away when two aircrafts hit two giant buildings and fuel and debris and everything else fly out all over the fucking place.  Yeah, the building got severely damaged.  Wouldn't there be some shaking going on?  A little shaking.  A whole lot of shaking going on.  Which could cause some structural damage, possibly? 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  It's not just the beams melting.  They were kind of hanging.  The beams were built where the floors would hang on the outer beams.  And they only had like one, whatever they call it, they would hang by.  Yeah, like a flange.  All right, one flange.  Had they had two, they said they might have withstood it.  Well, why didn't they put two flanges in?  Because who expected that to happen?  I don't want to know that.  Buildings were there for a while.  And holding up a floating floor. 
[00:11:00]  Do we have one flange in this building?  No, but there was a lot of them.  But I mean, if they had all been doubled.  Right, right.  They said a month.  But once that buckled a little bit in the flange and it snapped, then the whole thing, kind of like an erector set, opened and fell.  It's not that complicated.  A house of cards?  Yes, I've said that many times.  I was yelling that on 9-12.  They called me the house of cards, kid.  You ever build a house of cards when you were little?  Oh, of course.  See how high you could get it?  Me and my friend jerked off in one.  Oh, boy.  There was two ways to do it, too. 
[00:11:30]  There was the very hard way when you were a kid, which is just take the cards and try to build a house out of it.  And there was the cheating way where you bent the card in the middle and built it and angered your parents  because they couldn't now play Pinochle.  That was the game of choice at your house?  I hated Pinochle.  Pinochle.  Pinochle because there were always Pinochle decks around the house and you wanted to play, like, 21 as a kid or any other game kids play.  And it was just all fucking face cards. 
[00:12:00]  What is this?  Pinochle.  I don't even know how you play Pinochle.  I don't either.  Or is it Pinochle?  All I remember is a bunch of my parents and their friends and they're drunk and they're just, like, drinking and throwing cards down on the table  and going, like, real hard, throwing it down, going, pshk, ah!  Ah, yo.  Just like, ah!  That's my memory of my parents playing cards with their friends, flapping the card down, going, pshk, ah!  Were they playing for money?  Who knows? 
[00:12:30]  Maybe they were playing to swap lives and stuff.  They were playing to swing.  I have no idea what was going on back then.  I don't know.  If I win this game, I get your wife.  I swear we're swinging.  We're swinging.  More Ed Asner as a truther on the Adam Carolla podcast.  But, Ed, don't you, here's the way I feel about our government.  I don't feel like they're good enough to pull this off.  And I feel like they're always talking.  There's somebody talking at some point.  Like, I'll give you an example. 
[00:13:00]  You know, when we went in, when Bush said, hey, Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction,  and thus, that is our excuse to roll in there and take that place over.  And then later on, we found out, well, it turns out he didn't have any of the WMDs.  So, why did we find out there were no weapons of mass destruction if our government is good at doing conspiracies?  Wouldn't somebody said, hey, dig a hole in the desert, put a couple of barrels of mustard gas in there, 
[00:13:30]  and then Bush is not going to look like an asswipe, and then we're not going to look like asswipes for declaring war on a country  because they had weapons of mass destruction that we never found.  How could we couldn't even pull off that simple task?  Can you point that right there?  That's an amazing argument.  It's fantastic.  I've said that for a long time, and I don't mean to say it's amazing because I've said it,  but it's such a common sense thing.  And I had a, that was kind of my point with the guy, who's the guy in Dallas who we like,  but is a conspiracy guy from Texas, where he's from. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, Alex.  Alex Jones.  Oh, Alex.  I was asking about that, but I was kind of asking about why not just do this?  If they're so amazing they can pull this off.  They could pull off 9-11 without a hitch and make everybody believe this,  except for the certain few privileged, intelligent people that don't think it ever happened.  And to this day, no one has talked.  Yeah.  Why not be able to just, in the middle of a desert that we now control,  utterly and completely control, fly in some real nasty shit, bury it, 
[00:14:30]  like Adam Carolla was saying, dig it up and go, ah, ah.  Here we go.  Oh, cocktail time, huh?  Harvey, Harvey, huh?  Cocktail time.  When he came in and saw the two drinks.  Oh, cocktail time.  Best line probably in TV shows ever.  Gee, I never knew Davy Crockett was so fat.  He couldn't say anything because he was so wrong.  And the kid was so small. 
[00:15:00]  He had sleepies in his eyes still, and he's just like, ew, fat man.  But how perfectly delivered on live TV did that little kid hit that out of the park?  That was perfect.  I never knew Davy Crockett was so fat.  So, still funny.  Pow.  Well, there you go.  Adam makes the same point there.  Yeah.  Let's see what Ed says.  He's got to come back.  Because it wasn't the same department of government.  Was it different?  Yeah.  The ones that aren't good at conspiracy.  That's right.  Don't you feel, though, that somebody's going to pop up on 60 Minutes and so forth? 
[00:15:30]  No, they die too easily.  Oh, really?  He is insane with this.  Like, this is...  And he's one of the worst arguers about this I've ever heard.  He's very bad.  This is...  Like, I've heard some of these fucking truthers, man, where at least they have some kind of answer for it.  Even if it's the one you heard a thousand times, the one you couldn't dispel.  So, Ed's just like, well, it's a different secret branch of the government.  Oh, really?  I like how Adam threw that one in. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, the one that's not good at conspiracies.  Wouldn't they put the best, bestest conspiracy branch of the government on the burying WMDs?  I think they would.  And finally, one more from Ed Asner.  What's the upside of this?  To be able to declare war?  This certainly helps.  But is there an easier way to do that?  Man, I mean, like I said, just plant some WMDs somewhere and gas a couple of locals.  And kill 3,000 people?  Well, no, I'm saying, why go... 
[00:16:30]  And launch it in sufficient numbers.  I feel like we've started wars over less.  We have.  But I think the people, in all of their stupidity, have gotten a little smarter.  So you can't easily pull a Gulf of Tonkin.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, so two points into a trade center.  The lying has to be bigger.  The two chiefs of the 9-11 Commission have both stated that the CIA did not completely inform them, 
[00:17:00]  that they were denied information.  Exactly.  And my bottom line in all of this is that this country, which is the greatest, strongest country that ever existed in the world in terms of power,  supposedly had a defense which could not be penetrated all these years, waiting for the Russians.  We thought they cannot handle the fact it was penetrated.  And all of that was eradicated by 19 Saudi Arabians, supposedly. 
[00:17:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  Some of whom didn't even know how to fly.  One of the...  The one that supposedly flew into the Pentagon did a 180-degree turn, which experienced pilots, they can't be done.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  He couldn't fly.  That's why.  He couldn't fly.  He was supposed to hit the fucking White House or the Capitol, dummy.  Might have just got lucky.  Yeah.  And that's another thing, the luck factor.  There might have been some luck involved.  There's so many luck factors and just shit that happens. 
[00:18:00]  But they still only pulled it off 75%.  Yeah.  The last one fell.  The last one fell.  People forget, like, the passengers took the...  Once people knew what was happening, the passengers took the last flight.  Oh, you think that happened?  They flew to Cleveland, were let off, and they're on vacation somewhere in Costa Rica.  You think there might have been a few guys that just chickened out, too?  You said, fuck this?  Fuck this.  Allah, Allah, I'm out of here.  I'm just going to sit back and enjoy the rest of this flight.  Allah, ah, fuck it.  Yeah.  Allah, ah, fuck it. 
[00:18:30]  There was only Zacharias Musai, who was convicted.  It was the 20th.  I mean, that was it.  Yeah.  No, these guys were committed, man.  There you go.  There's one chilling scene in some show about the hijackers.  It was a movie from their point of view.  Not about, like, that they were right, but just showing you what they went, like, their process that day and how they got on the planes and all that stuff.  And the one guy just called his girlfriend and was chilling.  And she was a white girl.  Oh, yeah, right, right.  And he's like, I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  And she's like, what do you say?  What, what, what?  I love you.  It was really creepy. 
[00:19:00]  And then he gets on a plane and fucking.  But, you know, she was like an American girl.  A lot of these guys dated American chicks.  Of course they did.  It's chilling.  We're the American chicks that they dated.  They ever come out of the woodwork?  Yeah, I mean, they've been talked to.  They had nothing to do with it.  They were just chicks who liked big dick, I guess.  These guys apparently provided it.  Well, there you go.  They know, right?  Yeah.  There you go.  That's how we start today.  Ed Asner.  I don't know why.  Dumb Ed.  We kind of got to Ed Asner today, right?  Yeah.  From the Stacey Keech intro.  I'm glad.  But there's no argument.  He had nothing.  He's just saying things like, how could they have? 
[00:19:30]  That's not possible.  Branch of the government.  What?  Who?  Who?  Where?  What are they doing now?  Is it still in existence?  Where are they?  Yeah.  Somebody would have updated their Facebook status with, hey, I was the guy.  I was one of the guys.  Oh, no.  Wait.  According to that, sure.  Two of them are flying for Saudi Arabia Airlines.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Like, shut up.  Yeah, right.  That's kind of a cool gig.  Like, wow, you're the guys that they used to pull off the big conspiracy in the U.S. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, yeah, working for 75K a year here.  Yeah, this is great.  You're not.  Well, there you have it.  What's a crap.  What else is going on?  Regis is retiring.  We kind of broke that yesterday when it hit.  And he's not sick or anything, right?  He's just retiring.  I don't know.  No one's saying anything except he's just saying he's done at the end of the summer, I guess.  Maybe his contract's up.  But it's just time to step away.  You think maybe a force out?  He's 79.  You think maybe a force out? 
[00:20:30]  They're looking going like.  Maybe the ratings are dropping slightly.  They're like, ah, if we get some young buck in here.  Who, though?  With Kelly Ripa.  Because she's hot and she's, you know.  Yeah.  And Regis is, I got to tell you, and we've talked about this in the past, it's Regis' show.  You know, that's what it is.  But that guy's pretty out of touch as far as, like, this century especially, and probably  the second half of the last century.  Not as bad as Larry King was at the end, though.  No.  Maybe he wants to avoid all that horse shit.  Maybe he saw Larry and was like, I don't want to be that guy. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, I want to step out.  What the hell's a computer?  I don't even know how to work it.  The foot pedal doesn't work, and my coffee cup holder won't come out.  That old guy.  I love the coffee cup holder.  What was that?  That was your disc drive.  Oh.  When you hit it and it comes out, look, it's complete with a cup holder and a sewing machine  foot pedal.  I love it.  What was the foot pedal?  The mouse.  The mouse.  On the floor and step on it.  That's a stupid mouse.  I don't know. 
[00:21:30]  It's not doing anything.  What's this little arrow?  Oh, my God, I clicked something.  It's hardcore pornography.  I love it.  He certainly would.  What happened?  Yeah.  What happened?  I was just going to start riffing, but it's just too early.  Oh.  All right.  When you're ready to riff, you do that.  I was at a site.  I love it.  You know, little animals, hamsters.  Love hamsters. 
[00:22:00]  There's a whole site dedicated to them.  Ex-hamster.  I love it.  I'm going there later.  And my favorite color is red.  And I got a red tube.  It's marvelous.  I click on the little topics on the side.  Tranny.  Give me a little click through here.  This is wonderful.  I love the teens.  You ever see teens?  Oh, look.  Somebody sent me an email.  How do I get this?  Look, a link.  Regis, you got to click this. 
[00:22:30]  Very important.  Okay.  What the hell is a meat spin?  I was invited to a lemon party.  A pumping party.  And a pumping party with Gelman.  I heard they referenced a lemon party over the weekend.  Was it the Simpsons?  Family Guy?  One of them.  I think the Simpsons.  Was it the Simpsons?  About lemon party, right?  Yeah.  Maybe if we could find that.  Because lemon party is a classic.  Took them long enough. 
[00:23:00]  A fucking classic, huh?  Took them long enough.  Yeah, I know.  They seem to be a little behind these days.  I guess shit has to get really, really, like, known before they pop it on.  Or else people will be like, what?  Of course, E-Rock goes, it's the Simpsons.  E-Rock is the last remaining Simpsons fan.  Yeah.  And what else gave up on that show?  I don't know.  Turn of the fucking decade.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  I might catch it every so long.  You still like the Simpsons, E-Rock?  Yeah, I still watch it.  I still like it.  It's, um...  Homer makes him feel good about himself.  He's my idol.  Has it fallen off at all, or is it still funny? 
[00:23:30]  It's fallen off for many years.  Has it?  Yeah.  After season 12, it kind of...  Season 12?  Is that fall...  Has South Park fallen off like that, or no?  They stayed consistently edgy, right?  South Park's getting better.  It's gotten better since the first season.  Absolutely.  What year is that in that?  That's going to be 12 years, right?  15 years?  South Park...  I think it's in its 14th season.  Holy shit.  That's about right.  My ex liked it, and that was, I remember, dated in 99.  Like, that's how...  Fuck, man.  That's right.  That was an idea for liking a cartoon.  We were in Boston when that started, so...  And that's a long time ago at this point. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  How many guys write that?  It's not just Matt and Trey, right?  I'm sure they get a whole...  It's Matt and Trey, and I think, like, two or three other people.  Yeah.  Is this worth playing?  Yeah.  Those guys are good.  It's a quick chuckle.  All right.  The Simpsons referencing Lemon Party, one of our favorite things on the show.  Go ahead.  Hey, Smithers.  I didn't know you were a geezer pleaser having a lemon party.  Oh, a good old-fashioned lemon party.  I call for squeeze. 
[00:24:30]  Mmm.  Sir, we are way past your bedtime.  What do you think's better?  You guys...  Well, I've seen only a couple of each.  South Park or The Simpsons?  South Park.  I love South Park, yeah.  It's just funnier, right?  Yeah.  I like The Simpsons, but I love South Park.  Simpsons was good for what it was when it was.  It's just...  Of course.  Simpsons is just kind of over now.  It kind of started with The Simpsons in a way, right?  They still skewer stuff, though, right?  Oh, yeah.  They do.  It's just you could...  I mean, you know, you could watch...  I mean, Eric will back me up on this.  I mean, I think you could watch The Simpsons in any, like, three- or four-year chunks, 
[00:25:00]  and it's a completely different show each time.  Yeah.  I mean, it really does evolve over the years.  I go Family Guy, South Park, Simpsons.  As far as your cartoon?  Well, as far as the big three go.  I don't know any of them.  You don't know Family Guy?  No, no, I know.  Like, I've seen moments where they were funny.  The moments I've seen were funny.  Peter Griffin's one of the funniest fucking cartoon characters ever.  Ever.  That's debated a lot.  People either love fucking Family Guy or hate it.  I like Peter Griffin over Homer.  Somebody made a really good point about Family Guy to me, and I can't watch it the same 
[00:25:30]  way anymore, like, I don't love it as much anymore now, because I always think about  it, and it's true.  They told you it was a cartoon?  No, someone's like, someone said, you know, Family Guy, they do make jokes and stuff, but  a lot of times, what they're saying, it's not so much that it's funny, they just kind  of say, hey, remember this happened?  Yeah, yeah.  And then you're supposed to go, oh, yeah, nostalgia, that's really funny, and laugh about it.  Like, they'll reference the Hulk, or they'll reference, you know, just some old movie or  some 80s movie, and you go, all right, yeah, that happened.  Oh, it reminds me of that time I was watching Gone with the Wind.  Yeah, but then they'll be in front of the TV watching Gone with the Wind, and then go 
[00:26:00]  back.  It's like, what just happened, so?  It's like, it wasn't like a real funny joke or anything, but that's, and a lot of people  criticize Family Guy for that.  I can't talk shit, I still watch it all the time, so.  South Park did a whole episode making fun of Family Guy, saying that all their writers  was just two manatees in a tank, and they would take a noun and a verb and a situation  and move the balls around, and that's what they wrote the story on.  Ah, it was pretty good.  I don't know what their stories are, I guess their stories are.  Because there's so many cutaways, you know, like, they can't have a scene with, I think  that it was a big deal once, because Family Guy did a whole episode without ever doing a 
[00:26:30]  cutaway, like, because they just go, they just go to these random non-sequiturs all the  time, and that's become Family Guy.  Okay.  What ruined Family Guy for me was our interview with Seth McFarlane.  He's like a fucking wet sponge.  But he was really good on that fucking Hasselhoff roast.  Was he?  Yeah, I think he did a great job hosting.  I think he might be one of those guys, and we come across him from time to time, they  don't really respect radio.  So they're like, they just wake up, roll out of bed, like, oh yeah, I'll just, I'll  get this dumb three minute, five minute interview out of the way. 
[00:27:00]  Maybe.  He's not so much of a morning guy.  Oh.  Really?  Oh.  Why would he put his fist in his mouth and tilt his head back?  Because I think he likes to drink a lot of Jack Daniels.  Hey, man.  You would become a hardcore drinker if you had a ticket for one of those fucking planes.  Yeah, exactly.  How do you go through life?  If you missed one of the 9-11 planes.  He was supposed to be on one of the 9-11 planes.  He's got the ticket to this day.  I guess his government work is a little more important now, if you see what I mean. 
[00:27:30]  Fuck yeah.  Which you can't.  I would start a heroin habit.  No problem.  Or how the fuck do you go through life knowing you were supposed to be on the plane?  And what was the deal?  He got stuck in traffic or something like that?  I wonder if it was drinking or whatever.  It made him sleep late.  Who knows?  Ah, see?  But then every day is like a promised day.  It is like a...  I hate to say gift.  It's corny.  Is that how it works?  But it's like if you see something that would have absolutely been your death.  Like, you know, you're like, hey, if I walked out a minute earlier, that's safe would have  fallen on me. 
[00:28:00]  But there's...  What day are you living at?  They're bringing a safe through a window.  They absolutely do, yes.  With fucking block and tackle.  They do that all the time on my block.  And black and white people.  Oh, the ice delivery man could be walking up the stairs with a block of ice for your refrigerator.  And there's a dog with a little black eye.  And they're raising a piano as well.  Yes.  A no blacks allowed sign could fall on your heads.  Yes.  Well, if you can, if you're in certain areas of Long Island in Nassau County.  And this is the music that has to play every time you're delivering a safe. 
[00:28:30]  That Model T, the Model T almost hit me.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Yes, I got to hear the oh, God.  Oh, God.  Jesus, Jimmy.  A fucking safe could have fallen on you.  And the cobblestone's fallen.  This is my riff.  I love that.  Ah, yes.  No, whatever the dumb example is.  Or I would have been killed.  Like, whatever argument you can have with yourself.  Even a car accident.  Like, if I had gone. 
[00:29:00]  I would have had that accident.  But you never know.  Because if there's four of you or five of you in the car, you could have said, look, stop.  I got to piss.  But on a plane, you can't convince yourself.  You know that's what would have happened.  Yeah.  So it's like, you should be dead.  Unless he'd have been the big hero.  No.  And saved everybody.  Maybe that's what he thinks every day.  Come on.  I would have been the guy.  He could have entertained the hijackers with his Stewie impression.  For sure.  They'd have been like, I love Stewie.  This is great.  What the fuck?  You're the voice of Stewie?  Yeah.  Fuck. 
[00:29:30]  I love that show.  We could not kill him.  Wow.  What a weird start to this show.  It's good, though.  It starts.  How the fuck are we talking about a women party on The Simpsons?  You turn the key.  Just see what happens.  Betty White is 89.  Is she her birthday just happened?  And she looks it.  Let's calm down about Betty White.  89 at all.  Oh, Betty White.  I love Betty White.  She's funny, whatever.  They're overusing her.  Don't talk about anything being sexy with her.  She's not sexy.  You said she looks good.  Meaning that she's still very funny and she's still like... 
[00:30:00]  She is very funny.  She's not a doddering idiot.  She's still really good.  Fuck her.  Yes.  Out of respect.  For the story.  Oh, yeah.  Out of respect.  You would have to.  For her work.  Yeah, of course.  Not everything's a sexy scene, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes you just gotta do it.  Just do it.  James Earl Jones is 80.  I'm just babbling, sorry.  James Earl Jones is 80?  See, there's a picture from Blowing Out a Candle on stage after Driving Miss Daisy and Vanessa Redgrave.  He's doing that on Broadway.  I think so with her. 
[00:30:30]  80 years old, huh?  80.  All right, here's one.  If we're doing fucking birthdays.  Darth Vader's 80.  Bingo Lodge.  Dolly Parton is 65.  She should be way older than that.  She looks it.  I was a little fucking kid watching her on Johnny Carson and all that.  She's gotta be older than 65.  Come on.  Let me see.  She's padding that age.  1970.  Did someone put Robert Palmer's birthday down here?  I know, I saw that.  Who the fuck made this up?  Who did that?  We lost to Robert Palmer. 
[00:31:00]  It's like, who cares how old he would have been?  He's not one of those guys, like, you know, how old he would have been.  He would have been 62, but we lost him a couple years ago.  And then after that birthday, you would put, like, when he died and shit, how old he was  then.  Travis is alerting me that he's made a boo-boo.  Ah!  Maybe it's not the same one.  Maybe it's...  Oh, let's do it.  Maybe it's the hockey player.  Let's see if there's another Robert Palmer up there.  There's a...  It probably meant Arnold Palmer.  By the way, Saeed from Lost, there's a picture of him. 
[00:31:30]  Naveen Andrews is dating Barbara Hershey.  He's 42.  She's 62.  He's dating a 62-year-old broad.  I've been doing it for a while, your long-time girlfriend.  I saw Barbara Hershey on an airplane, coming back from Los Angeles once.  How'd she look?  She looked pretty good.  That's old.  I gotta tell you, she is old, but you know what?  She, like, I guess, you know, dyes her hair black or whatever it is, brown.  Yeah, but her pussy smells like vinegar.  Nah, it's got to.  It has to.  It's got to.  It has to have that.  Yeah, yeah, that's old school.  You're fucking making pickles.  I don't know.  One of these days, maybe I'll know what that old pussy smells like. 
[00:32:00]  God forbid.  Because I don't know.  What is it?  What happens when it gets all dried out, dried and tuckered out?  I never made it into the 40s my entire life.  There you go.  I'm trying to think.  That's a champ.  I think I came close.  Never made it into the 40s.  I think I came close when I was in Rochester.  I had a little fling with the business manager, and I was, like, 20, what was I, like, 23, 24, and I think she, I think she was. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, pushing, pushing at least.  She was pushing.  Pushing at least.  We had a little thing going on.  Mm-hmm.  That was the closest I came to a 40-year-old, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably, like, she was probably, like, 30.  That's the scary part.  Mm.  Ew.  Danny had a 20-year-old.  Wait.  Danny's 20.  She was 42, and she had an 18-year-old son.  Oh.  Oh.  That kind of sucks.  Who I desperately tried to avoid at all costs. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, no shit.  How embarrassing is that?  How you doing?  So if you want to hang out, then I'll go fuck your mom.  There were some awkward times where, like, we would take his car.  Did he know?  I don't know.  I don't want to know what he knew.  Oh, that is embarrassing and awkward.  He had to know.  I don't know.  It was, yeah, it was, it was not comfortable.  Do you know when I, when I did the Veil Festival in 95, I was, like, how rolled  I was, and there was a bartender.  She was glasses, an older woman, and she had a 19-year-old son, and we had some weird  connection, and I took her into, like, this back spa area, which was closed, and I fucked 
[00:33:30]  her without a bag standing up, and I said to her, I'm like, do you really have a 19-year-old  son?  While I was fucking her, she goes, yeah, and I came.  It's just how much older she was.  Wow.  Jesus.  It was so dirty.  Damn.  She got it, though.  She got it.  That is, like, hot.  She was great.  You know, I, I'd rather have a parent that's closer to my age than a child that's closer  to my age, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, I am.  It's like, okay, how old are you? 
[00:34:00]  I don't know if I, believe it or not, I don't know if I've hit that mark yet to where the  parent is my age or younger than me.  I don't think I've hit that.  I always dated younger because I'm just an immature dick.  Yeah, I'm immature, and there's plenty of time, if you live, to, you know, step it  up a notch.  Once you're 90, I mean, you know, you're going to have to step up the age limit there.  It all started when I, when I was in high school, none of the girls my age wanted me. 
[00:34:30]  I was, like, immature for my fucking age, and when I finally became a senior, all the,  uh, the 10th.  A senior?  No, you're not 65.  Right.  Oh, in school.  All the, uh, all the 10th graders all of a sudden, uh, wanted me, and that's when it,  that's when it began.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then my first year of college wasn't that great, because they, once again, all the girls  were my age.  I wonder if it's because I lost my virginity so early that I just, you know, perpetuating  the whole thing.  I think that could be it.  What do you mean?  That I, I, I'm not into girls like, you know, my own age and shit. 
[00:35:00]  Part of it is, I think part of it is, A, that they, they're very sexy.  Girls are sexy when they're 25 years old, 20 years old.  Well, yeah, the sexy part is, is a part of it.  It's also a lack of wanting to grow up, I think.  For myself, too.  It is not!  Exactly.  It is not!  Like, they're your adult.  But it's, it's weird.  It's almost like women who are, like, 19, 20, whatever, whatever, they don't expect a  lot out of you.  I'm talking 15, 16.  Oh, please, you think I don't, I'm not thinking that as I'm saying it?  I'm just trying to be, you know.  Talking code.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's like, it's like, 20 is 13 on Carville's high stream. 
[00:35:30]  Like, I have found all the women sexy and all that, but I just, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's  a few out there.  I mean, when I was, when I was single, when we were off the air, and my, my sister set  me up with someone my age that liked to play golf.  Yeah.  It was the worst afternoon.  It sounds horrible.  It was the worst afternoon of my life, because she was all excited, because it was a blind  date, and my sister really talked me up to her, and, and vice versa, and I'm on the  putting green, and, and here comes this middle-aged woman in a golf, in golf attire. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, God.  And I'm like, I'm, and, and my sister, I either called her or she called me, like, well, what  do you think?  She was all excited for me.  I'm like, are you fucking out of your mind?  What, what's wrong with you?  Oh, was she wearing a little golf skirt?  Yes.  Like she was trying to, she was trying to sassy it up.  Nancy Lopez.  And then she, she brought two of her friends.  On a date?  Well, it was supposed to be this. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, I'm yelling.  Cock and block.  It was supposed to be this casual, it was supposed to be this casual thing, and by the end of  it, because I like golf, she likes golf, then maybe we'd exchange numbers, and then,  and then all of a sudden, like, the two girls take a cart, now I have to walk with her,  and we had a nice, we had a nice day.  Oh, nice.  You should have just made jokes at every ball washer.  Right.  How old was she?  I wasn't a dick to her.  She was, she was in her forties.  What the fuck?  It makes me angry.  Or, or late thirties, I don't know.  Boo.  Somewhere around there.  Boo.  No, she was probably late thirties. 
[00:37:00]  Did you hit her between the first and second hole?  Oh, Jesus.  That old gang.  I love that joke.  And then I have to wait for her, and then we have to walk up the fairway together, and  we're just having small talk, and I, I, I did the right thing.  I wasn't a dick.  Yeah.  And then, and then we awkwardly walk out to our cars, it was Crab Meadow.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And now she's sitting there, and she had a, she had like a fucking, uh, BMW, she did  real well for herself, and now she's awkwardly standing there, hoping I'm going to ask her  for a second date, her number, and I'm like, oh, really, just a number, not even a second  date?  And my sister was working at a country club at the time as a bartender. 
[00:37:30]  Bushwood.  So my out was, well, maybe I'll see you back at, uh, you know, the, uh, the country club  there.  Yeah.  That's how I got out of here.  See you at the 19th hole.  I wasn't going to, like, ask her for a number that I was never going to call.  Yeah.  And then I never saw her again.  Was it?  Well, she can't.  She's in her home right now.  She probably, uh.  Who knows whatever happened to her.  Probably took her a little while to get over that one.  Dude, she was just like, like I couldn't even relate.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  It's just, that's what it is, too.  I can't relate.  I can't really carry on conversations with girls my own age.  Oh, no.  I can.  Call me a mature girl.  I don't enjoy them.  I could carry on the conversations, but I can't, I can't even think on a, on a sexual  level.  Here's, no, and I'm talking like, like, I could easily carry on conversations.  Sex is one thing, kind of, not, I'm not even talking relationship, but there's a point  beyond just sex.  If you two are just, if two people are just having sex, it's one thing, and then the other 
[00:38:30]  thing is you're having sex, but you're also having a conversation, like maybe a night out  with sex involved.  It's that night out part, or just hanging out or something, that I can't fucking deal with,  because I am, I'm not a, I can't converse with somebody, a girl my own age very well.  You think a woman in her mid-40s wouldn't enjoy, uh, drinking till two o'clock in the  morning while you belt out Sweet Caroline on a Tuesday? 
[00:39:00]  What are you talking about?  I've taken that off my repertoire.  No more Sweet Caroline.  What do you mean?  No, I've given it a rest.  You mean a woman in her 40s is going to want more than just you playing video games and  screaming fuck and firing a fake gun at the TV while your friends vomit in the fucking  fire pit?  See, it's hard to believe it.  We're all like that.  We're all immature assholes.  I know.  I still do things that 20-year-olds do.  Dude, I'm having pictures of me and Ozzy, I'm going to get them framed. 
[00:39:30]  It's two pictures from the same series.  Right.  I'm going to hang them up.  I'm not, I'm not trying to be this guy.  I am this guy.  When I, look, I dress like a fucking kid.  I don't know how, I don't know how else to dress.  When I sit and try to talk, it's, it, like, here's, if someone's hanging out with me all  night, here's what they're hearing.  I will ramble on all night about commercials on TV. 
[00:40:00]  I'll do impressions of shit that just pop on the TV.  Not trying to impress anybody.  I just, this is what I do alone.  If I'm sitting there alone, I will just start rambling on about how I hate commercials,  remembering lines.  And it's, I could say, oh, it's for the show.  An older woman could appreciate that.  Sure.  She would know where you're at with those references.  She saw it in the heat of the night in the theater.  Yeah, it would take a special kind of woman to remember that. 
[00:40:30]  I think you need a sex in the city type girl.  That is my nightmare woman to be stuck with.  Getting back to the golf date, my sister also goes, yeah, you know, she's, she's hoping  to, you know, get married and have kids.  And that's always been my thing.  I always wanted to be married with kids.  I obviously did it later in my life.  So I'm sitting there on this date.  I'm like, even if there's some spark that I knew the spark wasn't going to be there,  but try to keep a slightly open mind.  I'm like, even if there's a spark, I literally got to get engaged two days later, married 
[00:41:00]  in a month, and then attempt to have a kid.  Cause she was already like, pull it out quick, quick.  She was already, I think she was 40.  The sexiest thing I could see on a 40 year old is a fucking hysterectomy scar.  So, you know, at least you're safe.  Yes.  When you know that her fucking, her plumbing right now is in a trash compactor, you can  dump load after load in there.  And that's exactly how you should say it.  Well, madam, you're full up.  By the way, uh, Seth MacFarlane was hung over and that's why I missed that flight. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, wow.  On that fateful.  Wow.  Not faithful.  Fateful.  Oh yeah.  Fateful.  Fateful day.  F-A-T.  Yeah.  Yes.  I've made that mistake for years.  I always say faithful.  Oh, and everybody bitching about their ages and shit like that.  Just shut up.  I know, man.  You all get laid.  I don't want to hear it.  I, but they started, they have a clock.  Women have a biological clock that we don't have.  Like they literally have to get knocked up by a certain age or they're fucking, you know, 
[00:42:00]  they're worthless as a gender.  They haven't done their duty.  Exactly.  But we also picked a profession, professions, uh, you know, cause Jimmy's got the comedy.  Modeling and stuff.  Sure.  Modeling.  Yes.  Uh, you know, it's kind of a young person's business.  So that's in your head too.  You, you kind of try to stay young for what you do for a living.  It does.  It keeps you in a constant state of arrested development mentally.  I think, um, uh, it gives you certain resources where, uh, certain responsibilities you can shun.  Maybe you can blow off onto somebody else where you can, uh, spend more time, uh, doing either 
[00:42:30]  nothing or fucking off or hanging out or just playing with your toys.  That's pretty much what the fuck boat I'm in.  Do you know where age comes in?  And this is where I'll notice it.  Age?  During our age.  Your ass?  Yes.  When I get that call, why didn't you tell me?  And I'm like, I forgot.  No, age comes in, in arguments.  Like when you start, like there's certain things that like you actually wish that like, all  right, if you were 30, this would be a little bit easier.  That's a time where it can be hard.  There's, you know, there's the downside to it too. 
[00:43:00]  Sure.  But fucking someone in their mid twenties is the upside.  I'll take the unpleasant arguments over 50 year old tits.  All right.  With that, it's not going to get better than that.  We got a busy show today.  Yes, we do.  We got some Ricky Gervais stuff.  Yeah.  We got, he lost a lot of weight, by the way.  You see a photo of him today in the paper?  In the silver underpants.  Yeah, is that, is that Photoshop?  Yeah, buff.  He's got some fucking muscles on him.  Last time we saw him, he was a doughy mess. 
[00:43:30]  He's probably sick of being the fat comic and.  So he probably got a trainer and started eating well.  Oh God, yeah.  He's a million men.  Brett Favre, more fucking shit going on with him and masseuses.  They're coming out of the woodwork.  Now they're saying when he was with the Vikings, I guess.  Yeah, I guess so.  Not any masseuses are going to say that.  That was his last team, the Vikings, so.  Yeah.  I mean, but they were saying it when he was with the Jets.  So I thought it was like.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah.  Why are these bitches all one team behind?  What are they, now the Vikings shaking? 
[00:44:00]  Is it going to come circular?  Someone's going to say when he was in college and the Packers.  Jesus.  Why don't you report it when it happens?  Or shut the fuck up?  Yeah.  That whole family's falling apart.  Because then you've got the sister with the crystal meth.  Crystal meth.  Oh, right, right.  What's wrong with that?  Oh, man.  Also, I don't know if we promoted this, but it's Most Embarrassing Tape Day.  Oh, my God.  Today we're going to focus on the staff of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  And then hopefully as soon as next week we're all bringing in more embarrassing tapes of ourselves.  I know I have something that is just horrific. 
[00:44:30]  It is a song that was put out when me and my brother were in a band.  It wasn't Rotgut.  It was pre-Rotgut.  Pre-Rotgut.  Wow.  When we thought it would have been good to write a little power ballad.  Oh, boy.  This is probably the worst, most embarrassing song I've ever been partied to.  Joe's probably listening now. 
[00:45:00]  Tell him to email it to you immediately.  Yeah, email me that goddamn stupid song, and you know which one it is.  I don't know when to say the name.  Joe knows which one it is.  It's just horrible.  Did you guys think it was going to be a big hit?  Oh, you did!  You were thinking BAB was going to pick it up?  This was when...  Were you hoping for Homegrown?  No, fuck.  We were going to go further than that with this one.  This was a fucking power ballad like they were all putting out back then.  Can I talk about Homegrown?  Every bad boy has its soft side.  Can I talk about Homegrown for a second?  You know, obviously, I went many years playing music, and when I was working at BAB on Long 
[00:45:30]  Island, I was finally starting to get a really good show together, but I had to stop my really  good show to do Homegrown every night.  You know what?  Not once a week.  The local angle.  Not once a week.  Every fucking night, I had to feature a shitty Long Island band.  Keep it local, man.  And make believe they were going to be the next Led Zeppelin.  Of course.  Every fucking night.  Your PD made you do that?  Dude, it was...  Isn't that correct? 
[00:46:00]  And not many bands have come out of Long Island in recent years.  You know, everyone knows the biggies that came out of Long Island.  You got the Pat Benatar, Billy Joel, Lil' Joan Jett, Zebra, if you really want to count  them.  Oh, yeah.  Tell me what you want!  Twisted Sister.  Is that Zebra?  Yeah, yeah.  The guy with the really high voice?  Yeah, Randy Jackson.  Eddie Money.  Eddie Money is one of them.  But in recent years, nobody.  Yeah.  And when I mean recent, you know, when I was doing BAB, so shit.  That's fucking 15 years ago, I guess. 
[00:46:30]  Something like that.  How many times did you have to play George Cintron?  Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah, that's coming back a ways.  But they insisted on going local and playing...  We had a feature one.  Yeah, that's good.  And you can catch these guys this weekend at Cheers.  I could...  Yeah.  Couldn't do it.  Just bad stuff.  What was the last band that came out of Long Island?  Maybe somebody on Pal Talk knows. 
[00:47:00]  Like a band.  Band.  Like a band that had a hit from Long Island.  God damn, it's got to be forever ago.  It's got to be at least 20 years at this point.  Yeah.  Is there one we're forgetting?  No, this place done dried up.  No one knows, right?  Everyone's saying Zebra?  Zebra?  Zebra might be the last band that came from Long Island?  A band from Bayside.  I've never heard of them, so they're not fucking...  Yeah, it's got to be one where... 
[00:47:30]  It's got to be like a big fucking name band.  We name the band and everyone goes...  Yeah.  Ryan Starr?  Oh, Ryan Starr.  Oh, Jesus.  Well...  Dude, Ryan Starr is huge.  Yeah, I know.  He just played Webster Hall.  Was he playing fucking...  Was he playing the shit clubs?  Did he come up through the ranks or did he...  Oh, I don't know.  ...overnight success it?  E-Rock just said another color.  No one knows another color.  What's another color?  That was a local Long Island band. 
[00:48:00]  What do we know from another color?  Oh.  Ah, hey.  My theme song.  Yeah.  Does this go with the embarrassing tape part of the program?  Yeah, let's start the most embarrassing tape segment.  You would play this?  Every night.  You would play this?  Every fucking night.  I-B-A-B, who's this? 
[00:48:30]  That wasn't it.  Someone imitated me.  Would you get pumped until you heard this playing?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy's got to rub it in so bad.  I'm asking you would.  Oh, yeah.  Because it was a band that made a song about me.  People are going, this sounds crazy.  Idiotic and chaotic.  And W-O-B is on W-P-A-B. 
[00:49:00]  See ya.  Fucking E-Rock goes another color.  And I have no memory of the band.  And I forgot all about that song until today.  Yuck.  Yeah, every night, man.  Got everyone pumped to listen to my show.  What hours were you on?  Started at, I don't even remember anymore.  Nine to one.  And then they moved me up to seven at midnight.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you were late at night?  Yeah, at first, yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Dream Theater.  Dream Theater.  Well.  Is that the last band from Long Island?  No, I mean, we know.  The Ryan Starr is having some big-time success.  He's got a theme song on TV.  He's touring all over the country.  Just played a sold-out show at Webster Hall.  You guys are forgetting Eddie Money.  You said Eddie.  I said Eddie Money.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I said Eddie Money.  These are all the bands from Long Island.  Busta Rhymes.  Vanilla Fudge.  Hello.  What?  Art Garfunkel.  Wait, Vanilla Fudge was from Long Island?  Lindsay Lohan.  She doesn't sing? 
[00:50:00]  Well, she tried to.  Debbie Gibson and Tiffany, who are going to be on our show soon.  Bloyster Cult.  B.O.C.  Soft White Underbelly.  Taken Back Sunday.  They're pretty big.  They're more recent.  What?  Taken Back Sunday's from Long Island?  Long Island where?  See that?  Let's see.  Amityville.  They're my neighbors.  Amityville.  Oh, look at that.  Are they black?  I hope they moved out.  All right.  Mariah Carey?  Must be from South Amityville.  Oh, Mariah Carey.  There you go.  That's the last one.  Yeah.  That's the biggie.  Okay, we forgot about Mariah. 
[00:50:30]  Who actually went to my high school?  I should remember that, too.  Oh, brand new.  It was a pretty big band, too.  Who?  Brand new?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they got to play.  This mattered for, like, maybe 200 people out there for merit.  We're going to take a break.  Most embarrassing tape day.  We're going to focus on the staff today.  Oh, boy.  And, yeah, we got other things, too.  Stay there.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Outrageous, borderline illegal audio entertainment.  Entertainment.  The Firest.  Sirius XM.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  King of heart, King of God.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Baby.  Oh, yeah.  King of heart, hope it never drops.  Oh, yeah.  Baby.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  O.P. and Anthony.  That's a great song.  It's a embarrassing tape day.  Yeah, it is.  A little Motley Crue, right?  You know what's the tape?  I thought of bringing one in today, but I'm like, nah, we already covered mine.  But I have some that we haven't.  No, we're all supposed to bring in tapes.  New tapes.  Did I ever bring in, I don't know if we played this or not, the interview I did, it was after  my first TV appearance.  Uh-uh.  And they never played it.  It was, um, I did Friday night videos.  Oh, yeah.  That's the one you've been talking about. 
[00:52:00]  Did I play that?  It's a little.  I don't think so.  It's a minute.  Yeah, that's all we need.  Oh, it's a minute.  A minute's an hour.  Oh, believe me.  A minute turns into an hour on this show.  Of me just kind of saying that I was never good in scholastics.  Scholastics.  Or school, or just trying to be charming, and I was a fan.  Ah, don't try to be charming.  I don't think I ever used the word scholastics in my life.  I think I actually said school.  I was just at school.  I was just at school.  Most embarrassing tape day.  Why don't we get this going, man?  We can do the first one.  I love it.  Today, we're going to feature the staff, and then you definitely bring that in, Jimmy. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  It's got the power ballad song.  Oh, ooh.  And I think I might go back to some college radio tapes.  By the way, Joe Curry, who, of course, was in that band also, just texted me, and he  knew exactly what song I was talking about.  He goes, oh, this song for 100?  And I was like, yeah, ding, ding.  Oh, boy.  We all know it stinks on ice.  Can he tell us the name of the song?  No.  I want this to be the worst thing that's ever happened to me on the air. 
[00:53:00]  Can we pencil it in for next week?  Yeah, definitely.  All right, next week, we'll get the power ballad from Ant's old band.  I bet it's not bad, though, because Ant can sing.  No, no, no.  Is it douchey?  It's so douche-chilly bad.  Oh, you got it.  The only thing I can say that might get me out of it a little, but it won't, is that I  didn't write it.  Joe wrote it.  My brother wrote it, which is an embarrassment for him, too.  But you could have said no. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I could have said this sucks.  I'm not singing it.  Especially being the vocalist.  I'm not saying the name either.  You could have said no.  It's so bad.  How many words are in the name?  Can you tell me that?  How many words?  I'm just going to say it's kind of an obscure girl's name.  Of course it is.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I can't even talk about it.  That's almost like singing to a girl.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of like Sandy.  Baby. 
[00:54:00]  Like that, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  An obscure girl's name.  Oh.  What are some of those girl name songs that we have out there?  Huh?  Jane.  Jenny.  Jenny.  Jenny, who can I turn to?  What's something about a girl's name?  Roxanne.  Sweet Melissa.  Sweet Melissa.  Hey, thanks for doing that one.  I'm going to fig all the rest of it.  Oh, shit.  I could go with Jessica, though, I guess.  Sharona.  Sweet Caroline. 
[00:54:30]  Sweet Caroline.  No, this is worse than anything.  Well, Beth.  Worse than anything.  Oh, Laverna.  Laverna.  Is that it for Girl Named Sars that we all know?  Wait.  Oh, there was one.  Shandy.  It's an obscure kiss one.  Shandy.  Not a great one.  I don't know.  Really?  Was that the Shandy?  It was off Love Gun or Think. 
[00:55:00]  Love Gun.  Sounds like Voss singing Grease.  Oh, Shandy, baby.  Wait.  Shandy.  Oh, wow.  There is a song called Shandy.  It was actually big in Australia.  I used to be a big Kiss fan.  Let me see if I remember this song.  By Striper.  No, it's Kiss.  I know.  The video's sent by Striper.  Everybody put your hands together. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, this is Kiss.  Oh, wow.  It's a good video.  He's playing the guitar in the hallway on the way to the stage singing.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's not good.  They're like, come on.  We have a show to do.  And he's just singing to Shandy.  Every time I find the words to end it, something in your eyes won't end it. 
[00:56:00]  Shandy.  Oh, not good.  The night must last us forever.  This was very big in Australia, I remember.  Is he singing about a she-mail?  I don't know.  Say goodnight and go home.  It's not a good one.  This is a bad one.  I like Kiss, but this is not a good one.  Well, that is very reminiscent.  As the years go by, I like Kiss less. 
[00:56:30]  Do you really?  I used to love Kiss.  I still love Kiss, but I just pick and choose.  Not a big fan anymore.  Can't enjoy Shandy.  You know, you got to love Black Diamond, though.  And I don't remember that song at all.  Shandy.  All right, most embarrassing tape day featuring the staff, of course, Travis.  Oh, boy.  We'll be the first one here.  That's from something he did yesterday.  Travis is...  He got you so bad.  Two days ago.  Face.  Travis...  Oh, Black Betty, yeah.  We're going to continue with the female...  Slave Betty. 
[00:57:00]  Female slams there.  So, Travis, does this need an intro?  Most embarrassing tape day.  Of course, Travis is...  What's your title around here?  Oh, Christ.  Faggot.  They call him the Nutcracker.  I get it.  I don't get that.  Yuck.  Oh.  Thanks to you, I can't get coffee anymore.  Thanks to me, we can't do a lot of things.  Really want to...  Thank you for that, Travis.  Really fucking good decision-making there. 
[00:57:30]  Right on, man.  Jesus.  Great.  Jesus.  Holy God.  I'm going to starve every morning, but...  Oh, God.  But you keep doing what you do.  Yeah, go ahead.  And a big Montreal Canadiens fan, Travis.  Well, yeah.  How are the Canadiens doing?  They lost to Buffalo last night.  Oh, boy.  But I think they're still the fifth seed.  56 points.  About 20 points ahead of you.  Tape.  Does this need a setup?  This was a PSA.  This is...  I don't want to listen to this.  Oh!  That's the worst part. 
[00:58:00]  Why would you want to?  Of course not.  I can tell you that I haven't listened to this in 13 years, and that's when it was recorded.  And this is the first time I've seen you sit down, so you're really...  Wow!  Yeah, because I...  Look at that.  You're really uncomfortable.  He's got to cringe.  He's trying to fold up.  He's in full cringe mode.  College radio?  No, this was for a radio station in Central Jersey.  Radio station, Central Jersey.  It was a drunk driving PSA.  Drunk driving PSA.  It won PSA of the year. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, no.  By the New Jersey Broadcasting Association.  Was it the only PSA put out that year?  It was either 98 or 99.  What were the other ones for, though?  How to successfully rape an 8-year-old?  It was the only one that made sense.  So, yeah, I was 16 or 17.  16, 17.  Look how long you've been in the business.  I know.  So, it's like a minute 55.  I'm drunk, please!  Oh, you don't want us to play the whole minute 55? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, I want to hear a minute 55.  All we have is time on this show.  You know how PSAs, if they're 30 seconds long, are too long?  Yeah.  Wow.  How long is this?  A minute 55.  Oh, God.  That's a long one.  An infomercial.  Right.  Don't drive drunk.  What do you have to keep saying about it?  Take my headphones off now.  No, no.  Here's Travis kicking off most embarrassing tape day.  Oh, he took his headphones off.  With the staff.  I went to a party, Mom.  I remember what you said.  You told me not to drink, Mom.  So, I...  You? 
[00:59:30]  That's you?  Save Mom again, shithead.  And you don't...  You had to talk about your mom who left you.  Well, what did...  It's, um...  It's like a...  I told me not to drink, Mom.  Let me...  Let me do it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me just fucking figure this out from two seconds.  You're talking.  You're dead.  Wow.  Look.  I'm just fucking saying right from that.  Spoiler alert.  Spoiler alert.  That's like a Twilight Zone episode.  Yeah, that's the only way you win PSA of the year.  I know you're dead in this.  You're dead. 
[01:00:00]  You're fucking...  This is like fucking six cents.  Yeah.  Hi, Mom.  I'm outside the synagogue.  What's that pounding inside?  Oh, shit.  See, Travis's mom left the whole family for a Jewish guy.  She ran off with a Jew.  Oh, that's terrible.  Apparently, it's like a famous poem.  Hi, Mom.  Hey, Mom.  Uh, Mom.  I went out, Mom.  I drank, Mom.  Mom?  These are the last times I said that word.  Oh, shit.  All right, here we go.  I went to a party, Mom.  I remember what you said. 
[01:00:30]  Who invited you?  You told me not to drink, Mom, so I drank soda instead.  I felt really proud inside, Mom, the way you said I would.  I didn't drink and drive, Mom,  even though the others said I should.  Stop saying, Mom!  I know I did the right thing, Mom.  I know you were always right.  There once was a Jew from that tuck-in.  Now the party's finally ending, Mom,  and everyone drives out of sight.  As I got into my car, Mom,  I knew I'd get home in one piece  because of the way you raised me, Mom,  so responsible and sweet.  I started to drive away,  but as I pulled into the road,  the other car didn't see me, Mom,  and it hit me like a load. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, Mom.  As I walked in and peed in, Mom,  I hear that the police has been saying,  the other guy is trouble,  and now I'm looking to pay.  I'm lying and dying, Mom.  I wish he'd get here soon.  How come this happened to me, Mom?  My life bursts like a balloon.  There's blood all around me, Mom.  Most of it's mine.  I hear the paramedics say, Mom,  I'll be dead in a short time.  I just wanted to tell you, Mom,  I swear I didn't drink.  It was the other, Mom,  but the others didn't think.  He didn't know where he was going. 
[01:01:30]  Mike, he was probably at the same time.  It's only half hour.  Can somebody count the, Mom?  How long is this poem?  And then the effect is too much.  You can't even really hear what you're saying.  Yeah.  I understand you're in the echoey part of death,  and the death throes here,  but he's in the tunnel.  He's in the tunnel.  He's going through the light.  He's going through the light.  He told me not to drink, Mom,  but the paramedics,  how many details are you going to give out?  It's only his third year of pre-med, Mom,  and he's not qualified to save me, Mom.  My intestines were squeezed through my asshole, Mom.  Roses are red, violets are blue. 
[01:02:00]  Stop taking dick from that Jew, Mom.  Boo, boo, boo.  They put me on a ringer's drip, Mom.  I'm waiting in the ambulance, Mom.  Okay, they're mending, trying to mend a leg,  and give me CPR, Mom.  Yeah.  My Acura was crushed, Mom.  The side airbags didn't work, Mom.  Jesus.  My blood pressure's dropping.  I'll give you a fucking number-by-number appraisal, Mom.  It's endless.  He was probably at the same party as I. 
[01:02:30]  No, you gotta listen to it.  The only difference is, Mom,  he drank, and I will die.  Why do people drink and drive, Mom?  It can ruin your whole life.  Gotta get home, asshole.  I'm feeling sharp pain now, Mom.  Pain is just like a knife.  The guy who hit me is walking, Mom.  I don't think that's fair.  I'm lying here dying, Mom.  It's all I have to do in the morning.  Tell my brother not to cry, Mom.  Tell Dad to be brave.  And when I get to heaven, Mom,  remember I love you when you visit my grave.  Heaven.  Someone should have told me not to drink and drive.  If only they'd taken the time, Mom, 
[01:03:00]  I would still be alive.  Yes.  My breath is getting shorter, Mom.  I'm becoming very scared.  Please don't cry for me, Mom,  because when I needed you, you were always there.  I have one last question, Mom,  before I say bye, Mom,  I didn't have a dream, Mom.  So why am I dying?  Die, die, die.  Die.  Die, die, die.  Wow, wow.  Oh, Travis, don't go.  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy. 
[01:03:30]  Hi, Mommy.  I love you, Mommy.  I love it.  Please don't do this.  I'm not, Mom.  I'm not.  Don't disappoint me at a drink.  Please.  I can't even look at him.  Shit, man.  Yeah, that's...  Wow.  Your voice is totally different.  How many years ago was that?  That was 15, 13 years ago. 
[01:04:00]  Could have done cartoon voiceovers with that voice.  You're right, Mom.  That's pretty good, Mom.  It's an award-winning production right there.  Hey.  What award did it win, Mom?  Can they count the moms in that?  There's a lot of moms.  We can give it to somebody else.  Maybe somebody can count the moms.  Yeah, I don't feel like playing it again.  I don't feel like listening to it again.  That's the last time I'll...  How many moms do you think are in there?  I'd say somewhere between 400 and 600.  Endless.  We just crashed, Mom.  It's a fender bender, Mom.  I got my insurance card out, Mom. 
[01:04:30]  I know.  We go over to the side of the road just hanging out, Mom.  It's not really serious, Mom.  I'll be home later, Mom.  Sober, Mom.  It meant slow on booze.  Enjoy the road, Mom.  But the other guy was tricky, Mom.  So why do I have to pay?  And the more important is, Mom, why do the listeners have to pay, Mom?  Because the other one's really suffering, Mom.  At least I get to die, Mom.  They have to remember this, Mom.  Let's go to Jonathan in Baltimore.  Jonathan.  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Hi, Jonathan.  Hey, I remember these back in the 80s, but my car sounded like, you know, Chevelle's and 
[01:05:00]  things of that nature.  Travis just has a Tudor car in the background.  Is that what it is?  You couldn't find a good sound effect?  Hey, I didn't produce it.  Did you think that was a little sad?  Wait, you didn't even produce the award-winning PSA?  No.  Travis thinks that's a little sad.  He thinks that's a little sad, the PSA.  No.  A little bit?  No.  You tell me.  We pulled out into the road.  Another car came.  We were rear-ended.  At least now I won't have to live through the shame of when I was suspended. 
[01:05:30]  He doesn't even watch.  It's funny.  Yeah.  Is it?  It's on the air.  It's good.  I'm jonesing for coffee.  Join the club.  Want to talk about how funny it is right now?  Join the fucking club, kiddo.  I'm going through coffee withdrawals.  Thanks to Travis.  I'm not dumb.  This is smart me.  I really wanted to go see Paul McCartney.  Mom.  Mom. 
[01:06:00]  Mom.  Mom.  Oh, that's bad.  Fuck.  Oh, Travis.  Oh, there's a guy counting.  Really?  16 moms so far.  26 moms.  Alan Johnson 11 on Twitter.  Maybe it's about 26.  It's got to be more than that, right?  I think so.  It's two minutes long.  Okay.  Oh.  Wow, I was right.  You want to do another one?  Please. 
[01:06:30]  These are wonderful.  Love these.  Mom.  Most embarrassing tape day featuring the staff.  Next week it'll be me and Ann and Jimmy.  Good luck finding anything bad for me.  I don't know.  Oh, Troy?  Where's Troy?  He's coming.  All right.  I didn't even drink, but this is what I always feared.  Say goodbye to my wife, my lovely wife.  Oh, yeah.  She's really my beard. 
[01:07:00]  See, because you're gay.  I'm gay, right?  What's up, Troy?  Troy in the hissy.  You.  What's going on, guys?  In the hissy.  Hi, Troy.  Hello.  The newest member of the O.B. and Anthony show, Troy.  Yes.  Who likes a good conspiracy, but that's not what he's all about.  Not at all.  Just thinks it's interesting.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's going on in your world?  Anything?  Not much, man.  Just busy doing stuff.  Stuff.  Yeah.  That's good.  I like things.  What's on your radar right now?  Anything out there?  Where?  Here or? 
[01:07:30]  In general.  Just working on a lot of music right now.  Just really excited about some stuff I'm working on.  Okay.  But the tape I turned in is from one of my old bands from high school.  Oh, boy.  And this is when I decided that I was going to try to rap.  Oh.  You're rapping?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's pretty bad.  It's pretty bad, dude.  That can be embarrassing.  Yeah.  We're not doing it well.  The name of the group, Cornered?  Cornered was the band, yeah.  Cornered.  And the song, Let the Games Begin? 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  From 1996.  96.  You're right in the fucking middle of it.  How old were I?  Right in the shit.  Right out of high school, like 18.  Any black guys in the band?  No.  So you're just going to try to latch onto that whole rap thing and steal from the black man?  I loved N.W.A.  They were one of my favorite.  Yeah, exactly.  Come on.  And the Beastie Boys.  And this was sort of right in that rap rock craze when the corn was getting big and Limp Bizkit. 
[01:08:30]  So I tried to, I don't know, try to jump on that bandwagon.  Oh, really?  Did you like Ghetto Boys?  Ghetto Boys were cool.  Ghetto Boys.  Ghetto Boys.  N.W.A. was the shit, though.  Yep.  Love that one.  All right, let's take a listen.  Troy Rappin' from 1996.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah, old school. 
[01:09:00]  You want to be the best?  You got to fly like the rest.  Leave the test.  Win a contest.  But you got to stand up to make yourself heard.  Don't do your words.  Just leave my turn.  You wallow in the bottle.  That is your bottle.  When you drink your fist.  It's down to the world.  You wallow in the bottle.  That is your bottle.  When you drink your fist.  It's down to the world.  Everybody.  You got it all, but you can have. 
[01:09:30]  What?  Yeah.  Well, there is a little tinge of, you know, a few things in there.  Faith No More is in there.  A little Flavor Flav.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little Dr. Dre.  What do you think it sounds like?  I was way into the Beastie Boys.  Fab Five Freddy.  Yeah.  Fab Five Freddy.  Yeah, I'd say Beastie Boys-ish.  Yeah, a little Beastie Boys-ish.  Yeah.  You're a public enemy. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  Honestly, this is every band that was in and out then.  It's not.  You can't say like, oh, God.  Ew, ew, ew, ew.  But it's just like, yeah, this was every band that was out then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not that shitty.  No, no.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not that embarrassing.  It's pretty cringeworthy for me.  I mean, you know.  Cypress Hills.  All right.  Just, you know, growing up in the suburbs and all of a sudden thinking I could rap. 
[01:10:30]  I don't know what I was thinking.  It's a suburban white kid trying to like, yeah, hip hop it up a little bit.  What was your look?  At that time, just regular.  I was actually in a rap group after that then that I had a little bit different of a look.  But at that time, it was just kind of normal.  Nude.  Nothing nude.  No?  No.  But it's actually when I first started working with computers and music that I actually had 
[01:11:00]  to take a beat and loop it on a minidisc player because I didn't know how to do it.  So I would just loop it and then I learned how to sequence on top of that.  So it was very archaic.  What was the name of the song?  This song?  Let the Games Begin.  Oh, okay.  Got people saying, I dig it. 
[01:11:30]  Not terrible.  Would love to bash it.  But I feel like I listened to a lot of stuff that sounded just like this.  Yeah, that's what it is.  It's just like.  Carolina man with that one.  If you said, hey, guys, I just made a rap song here.  Play it.  And we played it today.  We'd be like, dude, it's a little dated.  But considering the time it came from and everything, yeah, this ain't bad.  No.  This ain't bad.  People saying, is this really your worst stuff? 
[01:12:00]  People are thinking you just wanted one of your songs played today.  No, I don't know.  It's pretty cringeworthy to me.  I mean, you know, it was the first attempt I made at rapping. 
[01:12:30]  So that's why.  Did you have to punch in a lot of vocals?  Were you punching in at the end of every line because you had to breathe?  Well, you know, it's just such elementary rapping that I kind of nailed it all and I could do a verse in a shot.  But, yeah, I mean, that's when, you know, we weren't using computers.  We were actually doing everything on tape.  So I have no idea what you're saying, but it doesn't really even matter.  I mean, it's just it's just gibberish, you know, like your conspiracy thought. 
[01:13:00]  That's what he's rapping about.  He's saying you're not raging enough.  Not angry enough.  Yeah.  People have said it sounds like and then they named every band. 
[01:13:30]  That's the problem with that era.  It's just, you know, a band like Korn comes out and they put out a record that's, you know, pretty innovative.  And they were really kind of mixing the rap metal fusion. 
[01:14:00]  Yes, the genres.  And then every band after just sounded exactly like that.  And it just became way oversaturated.  We were big fans of Korn.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Still.  I could still throw on some Korn.  First two records are amazing.  Even the first Limp Bizkit record was pretty good.  And then just everything started sounding like that.  And the look, every band looked exactly the same.  And white guys with dreads.  That's what happened at the end of the 80s with the hair band.  It gets watered down.  Every genre gets watered down.  Every band was the blonde singer, the fucking long poodle headed guitar player. 
[01:14:30]  And they were doing their fucking power ballads.  And it's just awfulness.  Yeah.  Awful.  But yeah, I was right in the middle of it.  All right.  Very good.  Here's Troy's most embarrassing tape, I guess.  That's not that bad.  Could have been more embarrassing.  Yeah.  You got to dig a little deeper.  I think you're not brave enough yet.  Being a newer member of the crew.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't want to really put himself out there.  We still got three to go.  E-Rock. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Is up next.  This could just be.  Then we got Roland.  Roland?  Roland on Carson Daly.  Really?  And then we end with Sam's embarrassing fucking tape.  Is that from his Saturday show?  Sam and Dave?  We can take a break and then we can finish up most embarrassing tape.  Let us do that.  No?  And Anthony.  And Anthony.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:15:30]  Little remix of the old Spuds Buckley, I noticed.  Made it.  Yeah, a little bit.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  I heard that.  I did about, I don't know, at least ten of those.  Really?  I was Spuds Buckley about ten times.  Only ten times.  Not much audio exists.  And people are still talking about it.  No one, including myself, thought this was so good, I need to archive this. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Hey, man, I did what I had to get my foot in the door.  It's like those classic shows that are only a few episodes long.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  People still talk about it.  We're going to get back to most embarrassing tape day in a minute or two.  We've got to get a DVD thing working so we can play Roland.  Yeah, that ought to take four or five hours.  So we might do a couple other things.  And then we'll move back to most embarrassing tape day.  How's that sound? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  In other news, this Camden layoff is ridiculous.  Holy mother of God.  If you live in Camden, just run.  Can't flee.  They lay off half the police force.  Yeah.  So basically...  And a third of the fire department.  And a third of the fire department.  So Camden's going to burn down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They will no longer the police department of Camden that's left.  Uh-huh.  I feel bad for those guys.  I know.  Poor bastard.  I bet you those guys were praying they were one of the ones that were going to be let go. 
[01:17:00]  Please fire me.  Take care of me and fire me.  Think of the worst...  Talk about the Camden layoff there, Jimmy.  Camden is a city with one of the worst crime rates in the country.  In the country.  To dump.  It's that bad.  So picture where you live or the worst area that you live near or something like that.  Camden's worse than that.  And they've just slashed half the police and a third of the fire department.  I think logically it makes sense.  Of course it does. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  That's what you need to save the budget.  Because no one...  I mean...  No one goes through there.  Unless you go into that concert venue.  That's true.  And you know, they keep the concert venue well protected unless half those guys are gone now.  I don't know.  That's going to be a...  It's going to be a...  I wouldn't go there.  We're fucking assholes.  I didn't want to go there when it had a full police force.  I know.  This is all hack material.  But imagine going through there now with half the police gone.  Unbelievable. 
[01:18:00]  Who's the assholes?  The state.  The state's not fucking doing the right thing with our money.  How could they...  How could these states have an unbalanced budget?  What does a balanced budget mean?  With all the fucking money coming in.  And can't you find something else to cut aside from the police?  There's always something else you can find.  Crime is your worst problem in Camden.  Crime is the worst problem.  So find something else.  Cut that.  And leave the police force in place. 
[01:18:30]  Jesus.  Well, for the police that are left, they will no longer respond.  No longer respond to vehicle accidents without injuries.  So you can just ram into people and wave to them.  Just wave.  And I guess the insurance has to take whose word for it?  What happens?  No police report.  No police report.  And they will not respond.  This is not a bit.  Yeah.  Scott and Todd would do this as a bit.  What else are they not responding to? 
[01:19:00]  They're not going to respond to minor theft and vandalism.  Minor theft and vandalism.  So if somebody takes like, you know.  A chain.  Yeah.  You mirror off your car.  Right.  Something like that.  Or keys your car or spray paints something.  As long as it's not, you know.  That's the vandalism part.  But the minor theft too.  Yeah.  Minor theft.  Taking your, ripping your fucking handbag out of your hands.  It might be.  That could also be kind of a battery thing.  Not in Camden. 
[01:19:30]  But that's, that's minor theft.  That's minor.  Minor theft.  Oh, okay.  Un-fucking-believable.  So.  So they're, they're not responding to those.  And, uh.  You want to hear from somebody in Camden?  Oh, Kevin from Connecticut wants to know, what about hat removal?  Will they be responding to hat removal by, uh, unruly teens, as I like to call them.  Unruly teens.  That's how the news describes them.  Yo, boy.  Good luck.  Good luck, Camden. 
[01:20:00]  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Mike.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Uh, just wanted to say, I, I work in Camden every day I drive in.  And there's like two main beings you could drive through and have no issues.  And I'm curious now if we're going to have issues even driving through those spots.  You're going to have issues.  I've never even saw cops before.  You're going to have issues everywhere in Camden now.  Yeah.  Is there a nice section of Camden?  Uh.  Like a little pocket.  Going to the tweeter center. 
[01:20:30]  That concert hall.  Yeah, we know about the concert place.  But that's not in a nice area.  They kind of fenced it off so you could get in the parking lot safely.  And then the venue itself looks real nice.  Yeah.  Well, then they got the aquarium and they got the baseball field, the Campbell's Field.  That's it.  Right.  And then aside from there, it's a war zone.  Uh, yeah.  Pretty close.  Great.  All right.  Let me go to Jack in Jersey.  Jack.  Yo, what's happening?  Hey. 
[01:21:00]  Uh, I drive a newspaper truck in Jersey.  Yeah, I got a radio show.  Yeah.  And, uh.  I like blue.  When the cops were around, it was really bad coming up and asking you for cigarettes, money,  whatever.  Now, I talked to a cop Saturday night and he said, uh, you just got to fend for yourself  now.  That's it.  Fend for yourself.  When the cops tell you you have to fend for yourself, you know you're in a shit city.  I don't blame the cops. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  What are they supposed to do?  No, fuck that.  They're going to now work twice as hard.  They're understaffed.  They did the same thing in Newark, right?  They lowered.  Yeah.  They got rid of some guys, right?  If you get rid of cops, then other people should just stop doing their jobs in those  neighborhoods.  Yeah.  Like, literally, you should just let it turn into escape from New York until the residents  get so disgusted with it that that city has to do something.  Why should you put your life at risk?  Because those fucking assholes who don't live in those neighborhoods can't balance the budget.  Who do we blame?  The government officials? 
[01:22:00]  It has to be.  They're the ones wasting the money.  It has to be, right?  Thank God the law-abiding citizens are really allowed to carry concealed weapons because  it's very easy to get your license.  Oh, that's right.  I didn't think it would be there.  Oh, Jim.  Literal Jimmy.  Yeah.  So bad guys, all the guns they want.  Law-abiding citizens, go fuck yourself.  And we're taking your police protection away.  We'll take away your Second Amendment right and your police protection.  And go ahead.  Have a great day. 
[01:22:30]  But isn't that amazing?  That's a great point.  The state has the power to lay off those cops and literally that's half your police force  and you're not allowed to arm yourself to protect yourself in one of the highest crime cities  in the country.  Wonderful, isn't it?  What a dumb fucking country.  It really is.  How dumb?  Just dumb.  The fucking government officials are fucking it all up for everybody.  That was his best advice.  Great point, Ed.  Watch your back.  Yep.  Have fun.  Have fun.  Take care. 
[01:23:00]  All right.  I heard they let the teacher go, too.  They take your protection away and then won't you protect yourself?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, here we go.  Thank you, Trevor.  I actually just caught that.  They let the teacher go.  That's the races in Camden, New Jersey.  Wow.  Well, you got the blacks making up 35%.  The 45%.  Why is it that and then that?  Oh, that's the thousands.  Okay.  45% black.  43.6% Hispanic.  Hispanic. 
[01:23:30]  Who the fuck is the white guy?  5.3% white.  And then you got the two or more races.  Asian.  Asian 2.5.  American.  Is that like Indian?  0.3%.  0.3%.  Okay.  Other races alone, 0.08%.  So it's basically blacks win, Hispanics coming in a close second, and whitey, wow, what 
[01:24:00]  a drop off.  Well, whitey was the police.  So that number's going to drop.  Yeah, that number's now been sliced in half.  So that's down to 2.5%.  My math is right.  Well, you know what, though?  I'm thinking this.  Maybe the people that make up the majority of the population in Camden will band together  now and realize, all right, without police protection, maybe we should start, you know,  patrolling ourselves, clean up the neighborhood, make it a better place to live, you know, not 
[01:24:30]  have so many run-down houses, clean up the yards a little bit, and maybe people take pride  in the neighborhood, and the, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, oh,  I couldn't even keep a straight face much longer.  Doomed.  We are doomed as a nation.  They just fucking gave up on Camden.  The minor theft?  Look at this.  Rich in New Hampshire.  Go ahead. 
[01:25:00]  This is minor theft, Anthony.  We didn't explain it.  Oh.  hey guys hey hey i'm uh hey i want to go shopping in camden i should be able to just walk in the  store and take everything i need off the shelves and walk out is that how that's going to work i  think that's kind of minor theft yeah you could probably grab as long as you're not using a  weapon if all of a sudden you walk into like a 7-eleven or whatever and well you can't make  you can't get the amount up to grand theft so what's the amount up to grand was it a grand 
[01:25:30]  all right a thousand bucks so you keep going back so you just pick up some food yeah minor theft  under 100 what is that somebody's saying is that true but can and and how much time has to go by  between each instance between each theft so maybe just wait 200 in jersey 200 is minor theft so so  if i walk into a store and uh i take like 50 worth of uh meat from the grocery store and i walk out 
[01:26:00]  with it the cops say they're not responding to that have a nice dinner that's what they're saying  we got all right kenny knows this shit this is legalized looting holy shit no they're gonna hire  armed security these places they're all gonna hire armed security private security a lot of these  cops go into private security until then though less than blackwater less than two my they said it  not gonna respond to minor theft that's walking out of a store with less than 200 of stuff i like oh  is that a camden street that looks like a movie set that looks like the wire no it looks more like 
[01:26:30]  the road no that's the wire you're right that's the wire that's season three of the wire yeah where  uh snoop was hiding the body wow man that is just open that up against your house i was just gonna say  how does it get like that what a shit hole i just smacked myself in the head because i know how it  gets like that oh please let me go to lancaster bullshit why do we all gotta bullshit each other  here come on lancaster what's up hey guys hey i hear uh they're gonna sub everything out to 
[01:27:00]  omni consumer products and a guy by the name of dick jones is gonna come out with his version of a  ed 209 to roam the street just like they did in robocop robocop robocop i got the reference my  friend citizen i would love that now i see a private security forces uh like the old uh blackwater  that was working in uh iraq how about that how about you just hire fucking paramilitary guys no one 
[01:27:30]  has to troll the fucking uh most stores most of the businesses don't have money to hire people like  that they're not allowed to anyway fuck what the fuck is going on we're gonna take away  your fucking protection and not allow you to protect that is fucking sickening great fucking  place they really did just give up on it i guess i guess it was like look this city camden costing us  too much money and it's putting out nothing in return so let's just abandon it until it burns to  the ground uh and then we'll be done with it i believe it's called gentrification gentrification 
[01:28:00]  camden is going to be like harlem someday they're going to start buying up that property cheap yeah  and they're going to start building nice places and then they're going to put the police back in  and uh white residents are going to start moving back in they'll come in and they're going to start  pushing blacks who's going to be the first guy that does that that's a risk but it's low problem  but that's they didn't know i don't know you can brownstone very cheap you can you know buy a nice  property cheap let's say hi to mark in pittsburgh mark mac hey how you doing guys doing well fuck you 
[01:28:30]  and fuck your steelers that's how i'm doing i haven't forgotten we'll see what happens here on sunday  sunday at 6 30 we had a right uh right next to the empire state building well they were over the river  that was not a nice that's pretty close fly over the city coming back from the big game the big game  with the pats uh yeah i don't know somehow they were able to get uh sort of a flyby at the empire

[01:45:30]  weight what's that about spreads their ass apart i just something said i wanted to look up medieval  torture devices yeah and uh is that the worst one the triangle not there's everyone you think is the  worst then they go to the next one you're like oh yeah that would suck just as much do they have  the rat one i haven't gotten a rat i i just i'll tell you i'll just give you the names what can i  the rat one really fast is uh they they make sure the rat is really hungry and they put it on your  belly with a cage on top so obviously your belly is the bottom of the cage yes and then it just tries 
[01:46:00]  to eat its way out of the cage or they they lay you on your stomach with the cage and then they put  like a light flame underneath the rat and he panics and starts digging through you to to get out yeah  start trying to dig his way out of the fucking uh it's also torture for the rat of course uh more so  for the guy i think but man they had a lot of rats back then oh they weren't gonna miss one they were  dirty yeah what else you got just the names of these the judas cradle was a very painful thing that 
[01:46:30]  went into your hiney shaped like a triangle the coffin torture well man he named his band perfectly  the brazen bull the rack torture the water torture exposure the chair of torture the pair of anguish  is a lulu what's the pair of anguish it looks like a pair but it separates into four leaves all right  okay and you'd put it in the vagina of a woman or the anus of a homosexual or the mouth of a blasphemer  and you open it and it would open and crush your teeth and skull it's a hard medieval people 
[01:47:00]  wear pieces of garbage mine is called the penis of indignity  put it in a woman's vagina and she cries i'm gonna look at the uh the rat tortures next actually  but they didn't have ipads back then so what else were they supposed to do that's where their  minds were they need to be entertained no tv no tv no ipads no iphone no motor cars no blackberries  i'm not a single luxury i'm still in blackberry making a huge comeback oh god you've really got

[01:50:00]  yeah it's called 99 miles to philly and it's actually pretty good everywhere else around here  just sucks you only you would know the best place well troy introduced me to it oh yeah blame it on  troy like the drug dealer all right i know a place i know a guy it's most embarrassing tape day  what did you bring in for us um this would be the first official time that i was actually on the air  um this is from 1996 i'm 18 years old oh i wasn't supposed to be on the air because i was only being 
[01:50:30]  hired as a board op at the time but the overnight guy used to constantly call me 12 30 1 30 in the  morning saying he was too sick that he needed me to come in and do his shift for him drinking  could be yeah i think that might be part of it think there's drugs involved well that i don't  know i never saw him doing so now thinking i'm thinking your opinion when he was wearing  big legalese is 14 years ago we don't know who this loser is well he he worked here at one point 
[01:51:00]  oh no oh really did he fuck black children no okay that guy we know who it's not no but uh you'd walk  in he'd have a uh really oversized stretched sweatpants and a t-shirt with stains all over  it every time yes but uh yeah he he used to do uh a bunch of the uh top 40 and rhythmic stations  throughout long island and and new york city i know who it is yep you do yep okay well i used to get 
[01:51:30]  calls 12 30 1 30 dude i'm really sick you gotta come in you gotta come in after like the fifth or sixth  time of going in and he never would tell management that i did his shift like because they didn't  listen at that time how would you do it though did you have to talk did you well the first few times  that i did it i just you know he had liners and reads and stuff so i just blew them out and just  played carts and and cds and what have you but then after the fourth time i go you know what no one  knows that i'm doing this i'm just going to go on the air oh boy so i turned shot i you brought back 
[01:52:00]  memory when i was doing radio in buffalo i i couldn't i couldn't do the overnight shift  anymore yeah it was i was it was misery and i wasn't doing anything that great and uh so the  board out for the am station he was so excited to be there because he never really got to like do  anything except like hit a new sounder or something he was just babysitting the board doing literally  nothing so i would tape all my breaks for the entire fucking night show him how to do it he was so 
[01:52:30]  excited because he got to play all the music and then oh yeah and then pop my my my voice in and  i would go home and my six hour job turned into an hour job voice tracking no one knew oh hooray for  me the hell with you huh because the guy wasn't going to tell on me because he it gave him something  to do and made his night go by way faster because now he's on the fm station playing music and all he  has to do is all my all my uh breaks were on cart all right this is the one you play in the one  o'clock hour this is the one in the two don't fuck it up i went home i got a great night's sleep 
[01:53:00]  at this station some of the jocks because they still had uh reel to reel at this station and this  was a big station on long island and uh like the overnight guy would sometime thank you um would uh  i know exactly who you're talking about yeah you do okay ralph nester that's right good old ralph  nester he would uh record his uh his voice breaks on the old reel to reel but i never bothered to uh 
[01:53:30]  to learn that so i decided to go on my on my own yeah um after the second night of doing it they  finally somebody told them that i was on the air oh really yeah but the reason why they didn't catch  it is because the company that owned the station at the time it was in 96 so all the comp all the  channels um all the radio stations were being bought out by like am fm and clear channel and  those kind of things so this station was on the verge of being sold and everybody being wiped out 
[01:54:00]  are you going for a new more most embarrassing right here does this story does this story have an ending  people are wondering if this is the actual tape no here's something when you tell uh tell me where i  have a point it makes it so much more interesting to the listener i got a visual with it too if you  uh they're saying if that was your first experience they thought it was uh you had started on ham and  swiss radio oh say because ham radio ham and swiss food joke you love food people love the food jokes  with you uh iraq well that's that's hurtful can we play yeah yeah here's the young iraq 18 years old 
[01:54:30]  this is how i thought you were supposed to do top 40 oh based on listening to other people at that  station this is how i thought you had to do it 18 years old that means this is 75 pounds ago  oh less than that you were oh no more than that more than that sorry uh  18 years old oof i was just counting pounds i was under 150 at that time yeah okay under 150  all right a young iraq this is chancellor media's wbi

[02:28:30]  tape day featuring the staff today with sam uh you gotta you gotta share jimmy these uh medieval  torture things you've been studying for the last hour but uh some of the people out there need to  know what you're reading about one is uh toe wedgie well the one i just read i'll just read you what's  the worst one you read so far it's it's everyone you read is the worst one no but this one is they  said this uh the crocodile tube the crocodile tube wasn't common but it was used to kill many infidels 
[02:29:00]  and thieves the victim was fixated inside a tube just big enough for the victim's entrance the tube  having crocodile teeth like spikes was slowly compressed leaving the victim totally immobilized  now the torturer could see only his face and feet with the help of carbon and fire underneath the  tube the torturer gradually heated the tube until they extracted a confession or a confession or  killed the victim the former was most common as this is one of the cruelest and most painful 
[02:29:30]  tortures ever used on human beings with the face and feet exposed the torture was able to inflict  painful wounds on the victim facial mutilation and toe ripping were preferred choices like it's not  bad enough you're in the tube and you're burning with spikes it's like i'm gonna just yank some of  your toes off here and mutilate your face yeah what a bunch of sick boys it really is they really did  like confessions though back then yeah i told anthony you i bet you when they started getting rid of  some of these uh tortures people were actually like yeah man fucking fucking we're turning into a 
[02:30:00]  fucking we're a bunch of pussies it's a bunch of pussies the pussification of you know of  wherever this is of whatever this is now whatever it is it's still like you said it's  still monopoly it's monopoly we're still buying and selling to figure out what the names of the  country's gonna be that's when that shit was going on right that is bad  shit cnn uh apologizes you want to hear an apology what fur i don't know let's let's just play it 
[02:30:30]  before you go to break i want to make a quick point we were just having a discussion about the  chicago mayoral race just a moment ago my friend andy shaw who now works for a good government group  out there used the term in the crosshairs and talking about the candidates out there we're trying  we're trying to get away from that language andy is a good friend he's covered politics for a long  time but we're trying to get away from using that kind of language we won't always be perfect so  hold us accountable when we don't meet your standards do you know you're not meeting our  standards we don't need those standards that's not our standards john king sucks i hate him who is he 
[02:31:00]  and i know pete dominic has a nice spot on his show and that's great for pete and all that cnn john  king is a fucking bore the word crosshairs has been a metaphor forever it it doesn't mean necessarily mean  literal crosshairs we're we're not a progressive country we're fucking sheep when it comes to  language what's wrong with saying in the crosshairs it means you're you're the one you're the one 
[02:31:30]  focal point you're we all know what it means as far as a metaphor you're right it's a metaphor it's  rhetoric i'll say this though it's it's easy to attack the i'm saying we what's wrong with us but you  know what cnn gets the shit beat out of it by fox and i'm not fox annoys me too with homicide  bombings and their nonsense stupid but they're not overreacting with with this rhetoric shit  it's a bunch of nonsense well if we don't meet your standard you groveling idiots shut up  they're just embarrassed now because they were they were talking about it and blaming right-wing rhetoric 
[02:32:00]  and every indicator is that this kid had nothing but hate for the right yeah and and his ideologies  almost all were left-leaning so now these dumb motherfuckers can't keep babbling about right-wing  rhetoric yeah but it's been people who who knew him said he hated bush he wasn't a bush guy it's like  when bloomberg tried to blame the fucking times square bombing because he's he's a fucking very 
[02:32:30]  liberal uh guy underneath maybe it was somebody who is one against i think it was the mo is exactly  what it was a fucking islam shut up and so what are they not going to say things like oh well we're  really under the gun now and uh yeah in the crosshairs got it we got them in our sights uh that like all  those metaphors are just gone now i guess they're gone yeah oh i i it just it just amazes me in 
[02:33:00]  america we're just taking words away yeah it just amazes me that we're actually doing this  it's amazing it's uh yeah what about bullseye because it's not just that one bullseye you think  they'll get that because it's not just the media i'm sure in the school systems and all that i'm  sure there's a bunch of words your words a bunch of words your kids can't say or they get suspended or  thrown out of school for for whatever it's it's it's everywhere right everywhere it's just taking  away in the workplace you say one of these words that you think is totally safe by the way yeah 
[02:33:30]  you know we we've already given up on the big ones but now it's these other words and you're  gonna what get in trouble at work because you say these words crosshairs means nothing when you're  using it like that in a conversation about having someone in the crosshairs like the fact that i'm  sorry yeah go go go no no i said the fact that we're allowing some asshole psychopath who was  not influenced by rhetoric the media has just said they made it up it's these fucking assholes they've 
[02:34:00]  decided that he was influenced by rhetoric they decided has anyone asked him yeah the more they  said it too they had made a statement about how it was right and instead of just admitting you know what  we're a bunch of agenda-driven dumb motherfuckers who spoke too soon they now make it look like  the entire country wants certain right uh they should all be fucking killed i hope i'm using  that metaphorically enough it's metaphor assholes you are metaphor oh yes and i didn't mean actually 
[02:34:30]  killed i meant i hope that now should be driven to their fucking heads yeah a little one of those  medieval tortures oh and i love to put one of these dickheads right up in the crocodile tube right up  john king's hiney i like to set him on a metal pyramid john king if you watch cnn is a boar  with no sense of personality i was going to say sense sense of humor but i'll go with no sense of  personality it's amazing i feel sorry for pete dominic pete dominic is riffing and stuff and john's like 
[02:35:00]  doesn't know when to laugh doesn't know when something might be funny  oh i hate them all though uh hate them all  oh all right  it appears morgan doing well in the ratings huh  they're just tuning in to see what he's doing that's a couple of days right he's getting big  guests he had howard and then he had uh the oprah oprah did he get oprah i mean the guest uh the  quality of the guest is going to drop uh drastically and then we'll see what he's got 
[02:35:30]  i don't know if i like him uh i didn't like him on the the three times i saw him on that show  america's got talent yeah but i guess he wasn't able to you know spread his wings like he is uh  i'm not sure what i uh think of the piers morgan yet i'm gonna have to wait i don't like that  they're taping interviews i i like watching live tv yeah the jury's still out with me the jury's  still out is it is it is it it is uh do we need to play the montage of christian bale paul 
[02:36:00]  giamatti al pacino and steve buscemi enjoying ricky uh gervais i think we know that if they  were smart they would announce today that ricky gervais will be the host of the golden globes next  year ricky gervais said no one cared he was backstage he was drinking with the people that they  the news was saying was so upset with what he was again it's the news blowing it up  yeah that's making something out of nothing the news can essentially make up their own  shit and i don't think it's uh this uh uh conspiracy thing i think it's they want to make a story where 
[02:36:30]  there is no story so that people watch their news um so they make shit up people hear it repeat it  it gets written up in the paper and then it becomes the truth like shit becomes the truth  just because it's been reported as such oh yeah man and then when you come out and say no that isn't  the way it is people don't really believe it because no i saw it on the news and read in the  paper so that's the truth it is really fucked up the power they do have uh over uh what's real and 
[02:37:00]  what's not real anymore when we uh salmon here yeah let's get salmon here for most embarrassing day  day as we do that bobo uh recorded this for us hopefully a gun cocking being pressed against  hi everyone it's me bobo are you sick of hearing my voice well you're not alone that's why the show  is finally getting rid of me my one trick pony baby ass dick has run its course and now it's up to you

[02:43:00]  for sam well i had some guys that i hung out with in college sophomore year everyone experiments it's  okay no it wasn't not a sexual thing okay sorry i thought maybe i'll blow you and the three of us  thought it would be funny and it's just like a fun thing to do yeah after one of my friends  discovered a program called fruity loops on the computer where you can oh boy if uh fruity loops we  started a silly rap group you're trying to justify this aren't you oh wow i don't know how this is 
[02:43:30]  bad that's what i did last night i was listening trying to figure out how i could justify it or what  the defense would be when i came on today yeah and that's why i don't feel good because i don't know  what there's really no defense yeah you're making it look like it was more ironic than it was i think  back then yeah yeah it wasn't his tongue-in-cheek yeah let's uh let's fool around and just laugh at  this it's like you guys were like that's fruity loops right there huh yeah we could make our own beats 
[02:44:00]  i just use fruity loops all the time it's fun someone wants to know if you made any pocket money  no we weren't able to monetize a soft he spells it s-o-f-f-f-m-o-r-e you're soft it's actually s-o-u  s-a-u soft like sausage what year what was the name of your group well if you had a name that means  you took it seriously he just turned red and started laughing i was hoping you wouldn't ask what was the

[02:54:00]  horrible just the thought of what sam is going through and how i feel it's horrible as i'm listening  to the sam thing i'm just thinking how much worse it's going to be listening to the  shit you want to do battle of the bands yeah we should battle of the bands  you should do a rap with uh bob kelly bob kelly likes to rap yeah i gave up rapping at the end  did you for whatever reason yeah i think you still rap in your car by yourself i do but not my own 
[02:54:30]  lyrics he fantasizes that he's the rapper like jay-z oh yeah yeah yeah uh do you know what jay-z jay-z  song right now yeah i know lots of jay-z songs right now like a good rap one that's what he does  oh he does yeah what about when uh the girl sings beautifully right that's her oh i like that part  it's not as good yeah can you do a little jay-z rap for us on the spot i feel humiliated i don't know  if i can muster i'm thinking this can help help your situation i don't know i just went through um 
[02:55:00]  one verse in my head of of this song that i have to bring in next week can you give us the verse no  no no no no no no no why not us not a you don't know you don't have to sing the verse no no no no  just the words to get us pumped can't even do that why because it'll ruin it's got to hit you like a  truck you can't slow you can't have a truck slowly hit you it has to be gone and just plow into you 
[02:55:30]  it's that but but just thinking of it i wanted to leave the studio i i don't know if i'm going to  be able to sit in here while this is happening no i really don't know i just ran embarrassing it  the first verse in my head it is so it's so gay it's so bad was it so hokey and and just was it a real  girl no it was a middle girl even joe wrote it i don't know maybe joe knows the girl we'll probably 
[02:56:00]  get a back story i'll get a back story from joe joe could call in like after not now but after you  know when i have it and uh but i i just thought of a verse and and it's it's so bad i don't know if  i'm gonna be able to do this i'll bring it in but i might have to just go into the bathroom  bathroom and and lock myself in a stall and just put my head in the toilet bowl it's a horrible  feeling and what i'm the sounds i make will be better than this song i just have my my first tv 
[02:56:30]  set stand up yeah friday night videos which was hideous it's not as i don't think it's bad though  nothing's going to be as embarrassed i already don't know that i win nothing is i already dub myself  winner of the most embarrassing day is that you danny let me see that's danny on romper room who  are you hugging miss molly hello oh i thought that was miss molly you're the lady look at his little 
[02:57:00]  hairdo my hair do look at my little velour junior al sharpton jumpsuit that i'm wearing  and why is she holding you like that i'm fucking awesome is there video there's five hours worth  you spent five hours on romper room wow i spent a week how long did you spend on romper room  i wasn't there at all hours but the problem is it's a vhs tape and i think it broke somewhere  along the way so i'll scotch tape well at first it needs to get found and then it needs to get  repaired and then it needs to get digitized how's the tracking i don't know that tape that's just the 
[02:57:30]  tracking oh do we have more raps from sam oh we sure don't have them more rhymes that song's not over  that's it yeah bust out some rhymes that's all that's it i just did the one verse oh i didn't  want to humiliate norm for no reason and then norm did uh they were the rest huh yeah that last  verse i can't remember the lyrics in that last verse the verse we just heard we just heard it  we might have to start over yeah i think so we just heard it no we didn't sam would you sing along 
[02:58:00]  with it i could try if you want yeah i do oh i'm i don't know all the lyrics i'm trying  i know i want the plumber part you want it i'm trying to put i remember trying to put like  vocal emotion into this song oh oh no i can't do this is it really bad i'm thinking about it and  cringing it's so utterly bad are you gonna be embarrassed i'm not even gonna be i might have to 
[02:58:30]  just at the very least i can't listen and i'm gonna have to get like under under something like  a rock to crawl under it's that bad it's so faggily sung and so the the lyrics are so hokey did you  think you were really hitting emotional home runs yes yes maybe junior mink can sample it  that's the chorus 
[02:59:00]  what are you saying there well that's not me that's not me what does it matter what does  he say is that norm no that's matt singing it's time for jangling i think it's a what is that i  have no idea you do know no i don't because we didn't we wrote our own parts  and you didn't even fucking he said i think it's from some internet cartoon or something i have  no idea uh it is then uh i mean i was responsible for my part i won't give anybody responsibility for 
[02:59:30]  that except me there's nothing to be said i mean wow i did it very bad recorded it really bad  i like it you think it's good no oh what do you have i don't know i'm trying to think  i was gonna i mean uh and it's really fucking raised the bar so now i dig even deeper i was  just gonna bring in like college radio uh shit or my first professional radio job at cq 102 hit 
[03:00:00]  music and more i don't think i've ever played on the show no cq wanna see what cq 102 hit music and  more cq hit music can i at least be named champion of staff embarrassing tape day yeah what happened  danny's well like i said i didn't the romper room tape is still it's still mia at the me at the  moment but i will bring it the second i i do find it you bring you bring tapes of where you were  probably shitting yourself so it's like you're a kid i know but i really don't like i'm thinking i'm 
[03:00:30]  really really thinking like i i had old production that i thought maybe would work for this but then  i listened to it and it rules no it just no it didn't i just ruled it just it just didn't suck  enough like it was bad but it would it would have just been like playing it and been like yeah well i had  college air checks that i was going to bring in but then then i realized that junior mint was far  more embarrassing than any air check junior could ever be june when i was your mint no i when i was  doing modeling in the modeling capital of the world rochester new york i got tapes of that but i didn't

Yeah?  Oh, there she is.  Did you know that young Sam  was a rap guy?  I had no idea.  Yeah.  He never played you  the rap stuff?  No, I've never heard  any of it.  Wow.  Good for you.  Would you like to hear 
[03:10:30]  a little piece?  Yeah, I'll hear a little piece  if you've got time.  We heard it already.  She didn't.  Bobby did, though.  I mean, we could do this  in our private time  if she really wants to.  Bobby, can you bake us  some more stuff?  I know it's not Christmas,  but your stuff is delish.  Anytime.  She's going to do it now.  What are you going to bake us?  She's happy to.  Could you bake me  key lime pie from scratch?  What are you doing?  I can do that.  Who doesn't like key lime pie?  She's going to do it now, though.  I'd like something in an apple.  Apple pie?  Old-fashioned apple pie.  Oh, I'll go with apple pie, Bobby.  I can do apple. 
[03:11:00]  She's going to make pies.  How about for tomorrow?  I don't know if I can do it  for tomorrow.  Oh.  It may have to be next week.  No, that's not good enough, Bobby.  I want my apple pie tomorrow  or Friday.  That's not nice.  I really could go  for apple pie tomorrow.  Yeah.  What do you have to do  instead of make us apple pie?  I have a lunch date today.  Whoa.  Ooh, a date.  Red Hat Society?  Are you part of  the Red Hat Society, Bobby?  No, I'm not, actually.  A date?  I've never been invited. 
[03:11:30]  What kind of date?  Yeah, what kind of date?  Now Sam's a little concerned.  It's a friend that I'm going to see  and I'll be busy all afternoon.  Oh, boy.  I'm really sorry, guys.  That's bad news.  It is a girl that you're going to see,  right?  A girlfriend?  It's a woman.  Oh, that's not right.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, okay, good.  Is it, you know...  That's a good question.  Is there more than lunch  going on, Bobby?  Oh, boy.  It's so weird that you guys  are having trouble with your phones.  I love talking to Bobby. 
[03:12:00]  I love talking to Bobby.  To my mother, Bobby.  Bobby, is there something else  going on after the tea?  I wish you would have respect for her.  I'm just asking, Sam,  very carefully.  She raised me.  I'm not asking if she's  licking any box.  No, that's what you're implying.  No, you just said it.  No, I wasn't, Sam.  I was talking very vaguely.  She's still on the phone  and you just said it.  Just a lunch date, Bobby.  Listen, I want to know  what this thing is  with Sam and the rap song.  Oh, sure.  No problem.  Well, I'm glad she brought it back. 
[03:12:30]  Junior Mint.  Yeah, he was Junior Mint.  You just pronounced it Mint.  Did Sam do a disgusting rap song?  No.  I like to talk about plumbing, Bobby.  Yeah, it was pretty dumb.  Yeah, it was really  just stupid.  Your plumbing's not leaking,  is it, Bobby?  What's that supposed to mean?  No.  Oh, my God.  Just bring it up.  That's horrible.  No.  That's a horrible thing to ask.  That's my mother.  But it's in the song.  I know, but that's why  I gave up rap.  How's the pipes, Bobby?  Come on.  You don't have to answer that, Mom. 
[03:13:00]  All right, here's Sam rapping.  We just heard this.  Yeah, but now your mom's a character.  What's that sound supposed to be?  That's potato chips.  Why?  It's funny.  No, it's that.  Take it easy, take it cool.  Act a straight up fool.  Don't be surprised if you hear our beats  and start to drool.  My car's got big,  hubcaps with my bulletproof vest.  I sang with Elton John,  and he called me 50 Cent.  I write fat-ass lyrics  that just don't make any sense. 
[03:13:30]  I, I know.  Fuck.  I'm going to start it again.  Okay.  Ashton Kutcher sucks,  and so does Demi Moore.  But Demi sucked.  Ashton also,  she sucks more.  And I'm sorry to say it,  because I try not to judge.  I came in to write some stupid music  and pack up some fudge.  What?  Forget the last part.  That's not what I meant.  I meant to tell you about my little friend  who slept in a tent.  Right, so he was dreaming while I was peeping.  The plumber was keeping the pipes from leaking.  And the plumber woke up,  and he saw me looking.  I asked him to join me,  but just look shooken.  So I stopped looking, man,  all the way home.  Broke my ass trip and fell on a lawn gnome. 
[03:14:00]  Got up, then went and jumped on a bus.  Matter of fact, guy dog,  and his name goes,  what up, dog?  Man, how you been?  He kept me up to the bus like,  boy, you ain't my friend.  Okay, some guys do.  I'm so embarrassed.  I hear Bobby laughing.  I'm sorry, Mom.  Bobby?  There's a little potty mouth in that. 
[03:14:30]  Hugely potty mouth.  That may not exactly be my style,  but I think Sam has got something going there,  don't you?  Of course.  Of course, because Sam's perfect, right?  Because your son's perfect  and can't do no wrong.  Get me my fucking apple pie!  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, curse.  That's my mom.  That's Sam's mommy.  That's my mother.  I want my pie tomorrow.  Enough with your lunch dates, Bobby.  I'm getting jealous.  I need my baked goods tomorrow.  I'm going to put that on my to-do list.  Bake an apple pie. 
[03:15:00]  Jim, are you okay?  Do you have a headache or something?  Bobby knows I love her.  Jim's clutching his head.  What?  She had such high hopes.  I know, and that was, oh.  The plumber was creeping.  The pipes were leaking.  Well, that's why I asked her about her pipes.  Sheepage.  Yeah.  The problem with the plumber's on a pie saw.  Yeah.  Like fatty cyst tissue.  Tissue.  Well, I just want to thank you guys for drawing my attention to this talent I didn't know Sam had. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, we didn't know either.  Still don't.  Still don't.  There's nothing going on there.  Yeah, what's the packs and fudge?  A lot of people saying double meaning there, Sam.  Yeah.  Right.  That's why I had to stop.  What's the double meaning all about?  There was like under, you could hear me under me going, what?  You went, stop, hammer time.  Something like that.  Oh, because Norm wrote that.  Because Norm wrote a little more than a rap career, huh?  No, I'm just saying like, whoa, did I just say that?  Oops, that's funny.  Yeah, I hated your boyish playfulness in it. 
[03:16:00]  It's like, what?  Oh, I'll be stoned over.  Yeah, yeah, it was supposed to be funny.  And people go, aw, damn, he's stoned over.  Oh, yeah.  He's whack.  Aw, damn, he is whack.  The white boy is Sam and Norm, real rappers.  And that bottom of his feet should be whack like in Midnight Express.  Oh, yeah.  See, that guy was the fat guy with the two little chubby kids.  Bobby?  Before you go off to school, let's beat some feet.  Are you traveling tomorrow?  I am, actually.  I'm flying to Austin.  Thank you, Sam. 
[03:16:30]  Tomorrow, Friday, Saturday, at the Cap City Comedy and March 5th by Montclair.  Well, my theater tickets are on sale now.  I never care about a Jim Norton plug.  Why did you do that, Sam?  Because I was going to ask if Jim wanted the other Junior Mint songs on his iPod.  You got more?  Oh, hell.  Can you do a bonus song for us next week when we bring our most embarrassing tapes in?  Come on.  I don't know why.  Oh, by the way, I did mine today.  Fuck that.  You know what?  No one's even arguing. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, you did.  All right.  I'm done.  I'm done.  That coat shirt one where you're just spinning around and you and the girls.  Oh, your hands.  The fact is your shirt's tucked in and you have no belt, so it just looks ridiculous.  That's great.  It was five years ago.  Five years.  Yeah, it was probably more than that.  Oh, Chip.  When I made that, my wife was probably...  Oh, boy.  Uh-uh.  Let me think really fast.  It was probably five.  It's called not born.  Yeah.  She's probably about five.  Yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Six.  Six.  Maybe six.  Bobby, where are you going to lunch?  I'm going to my friend's house.  Oh, no.  I'm showing up to make sure that there's no funny business.  You don't know where a friend lives.  What do you mean?  There's no...  It's not a public lunch?  It's behind closed doors at someone's house?  No, it's not a public lunch.  It's just the two of us.  What's her first name?  I'm not telling you.  Tyrone.  Oh, shit.  Tyrone.  Oh, shit.  You know what that implies?  Black.  Exactly.  You guys do everything on the AR. 
[03:18:00]  She doesn't...  I don't think she'd really want to be, you know, have her name as...  Yeah, I understand.  Yeah.  Neither did Junior Mint.  We are terrible.  Junior Mint.  I understand, Bobby.  I understand.  You're not a fan?  I hope he's killed in a rap battle.  It's a group, not a he.  Yes.  Well, Bobby, we look forward to the apple pie and possibly a little key lime pie.  A little mixture would be nice.  Maybe half and half.  Now, you got a lunch date, but what about for Friday?  Well, you know, it's going to be bad weather Friday. 
[03:18:30]  You guys might not even make it in.  No, that's tomorrow, Bobby.  It's going to be bad weather tomorrow?  Overnight.  Thursday night to Friday.  It's supposed to be bad.  Meteorologist Bobby knows.  My mom calls me when there's bad weather forecasted to remind me to take the train if I have to forecast.  It must be nice, Sam.  It is.  All right, Bobby.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, can I play something for you?  What are you going to play for her? 
[03:19:00]  What is it?  I loved your Midway stuff, Opie.  My what?  Midway stuff.  My Midway stuff.  It was good.  Very concise.  Oh, the plane stuff.  Yeah.  You fucking cunt.  What?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Totally uncalled for.  Oh, my God.  Oh, totally.  Totally uncalled for.  Oh, my God, no.  Wow.  Oh, no, no. 
[03:19:30]  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony's home for the virus.  Sirius XM.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. </pre>
