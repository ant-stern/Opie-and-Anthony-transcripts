<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began in their new, spacious SiriusXM studio, boasting twelve televisions – a point of contention with other staff.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with interns Sam, Garrett, and Bobo,  launched into several bits.  A recurring joke was the "TV count," highlighting their impressive studio upgrade. Sam conducted numerous hallway interviews with SiriusXM employees, whose reactions ranged from amused to annoyed, with many commenting on the show's perceived "shithead" nature and the excessive TVs.  These interviews revealed anxiety among other staff regarding potential harassment.  One interviewee, Steve, directly expressed these concerns.  Former K-Rock personality Kane was also interviewed, adding his perspective on the tense pre-arrival atmosphere and recounting a past strip club experience involving "knee jobs."  Opie and Anthony also attempted to interact with other SiriusXM shows, like "Morning Mashup," with mixed results. They discussed their new studio amenities (multiple TVs, a well-stocked breakroom) and planned future bits, including bowling balls, glass walls, and graffiti – all potentially disruptive activities.  Their interactions with colleagues were frequently described with vulgar language, often focusing on physical descriptions and mockery.  A particularly heated segment involved reading and reacting to a scathing message from Alex Bennett, another radio host whose studio they had taken over, criticizing their excessive TVs and disruptive behavior. Opie and Anthony responded with considerable vulgarity and mockery.  The hosts' attempts to create a "wall of sound" outside their studio were ultimately denied by management. They also briefly discussed a guest fainting on Glenn Beck's show. The first day concluded with jokes about updating Alex Bennett's Wikipedia page.

Later in the broadcast, a segment featured a mysterious caller, "the fugitive," who claimed to have stolen $10,000 from Mel Karmazin (or a similar-sounding name), making increasingly bizarre demands, including smearing peanut butter on an afro and having co-host E Rock consume semen on air. This "fugitive" was revealed to be Bobo, an inside joke orchestrated by Danny and Travis that spiraled out of control. A staged interrogation, reminiscent of *First 48*,  followed, with Kenny (a former police detective) extracting a confession from Bobo. Bobo's nervousness, attempts to shift blame, and emotional phone call to a friend for bail were all highlighted.  The segment concluded with Bobo being escorted from the studio by two people in suits whom he mistakenly believed to be police officers.  This segment was interspersed with commercials and a discussion about Scorch and his low-budget public-access television show, "Pretty Fucking Good TV" (PFG TV).

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to reviewing and mocking clips from Scorch's "PFG TV."  Guests in the studio during this segment included Nick Carpinelli, Jolanda, Jeff Warrants, and Brian.  The hosts, along with Danny, repeatedly ridiculed Scorch’s on-air persona, the show's low production quality, and its bizarre segments, including the "Wheel of Meat" game and "Legs Zeppelin."  Recurring jokes centered around Scorch's past claims, lies, and delusional self-importance.  The hosts repeatedly replayed and dissected various segments of PFG TV, highlighting its awkwardness and absurdity.  Multiple commercials ran throughout this segment.


Finally, the show featured an interview with Penthouse Pet Shauna Lanee.  The interview, characterized by blunt and sexually explicit questioning from Opie and Anthony, quickly turned uncomfortable.  The hosts’ selection of unflattering photos and focus on explicit aspects of Lanee’s work upset her, leading to a heated exchange and her eventual departure from the studio.  Following her exit, Opie and Anthony played a video message from Lanee expressing continued anger and disappointment, and reflected on their interview style and its negative impact.  An attempt was made to contact Lanee to smooth things over, but she did not return to the show.  The broadcast ended with the hosts and staff discussing the incident and its aftermath.

[00:45:30]  yeah just tickers and more it is well i guess it is yeah sam you ready to go down the hall yeah let's  go see if we can go down a little bit we have charlie the intern and evan the intern and jill the  intern evan walks like more of a girl than jill does yeah the dumb private pile face of his  is that an insult to evan or jill evan all right just making sure jill has an odd walk does she yeah 
[00:46:00]  kenny's coming with a special treat oh he's got your grapes oh thank god he's gonna be presenting the  grapes he's been walking down the hall you don't realize how where did kenny get the grapes oh  kenny where did you get  no oh that would have sucked damn it i missed i went to swathe out of kenny's hand and i missed 
[00:46:30]  kenny where where did you get the grapes you're allowed to talk today  can i have one anthony take it down a street level really yeah from a street vendor were people annoyed as  you're walking by them with the grapes yeah yeah yeah they don't realize what fancy men you are yeah  you don't realize how how much of a bunch of assholes we are until like you we have to do all this stuff  in front of people don't put yourself down gh gh all right sam yes wow look how far he is now this is as 
[00:47:00]  as far as my headphones will take me yeah this is it but your mic can go further right yes  oh we're getting another headphone cable how much cable and describe the scene  how far is that i can't really i wouldn't be able to tell that was sam without his wacky hair  he's that far away thank god for that then he's way down the hall there's two cables running down the 
[00:47:30]  hallway yeah one for his headphones i guess one for the mic they are now um putting an extra one  on the headphone cable so he can go even further yeah why couldn't we just run the cables from our  old studio to here at this point yeah that would have been nice yeah just stay there and run some cable  all right all right he's he's working on how come no one will come down this hallway  because um listening to the show no one likes us it's amazing we're not liked hated is more accurate 
[00:48:00]  yeah like it's so weird we're just not liked but we didn't it's our first day and we already have  cooties in school we should have tippy tom walking up and down these hallways already oh  would that be fantastic we're like the kid that threw up in in at lunch it just sticks with you  yeah where's the open at the studio how you do it just wander around just stinking up the entire  place oh boy do i not want him in the studio oh in here dude it would be a gas chamber you'd have 
[00:48:30]  to be in the in the fucking in travis's little area back there yes beyond the glass yeah we'll figure  something out cue out pew actually we're working on our our next tippy tom bit yeah he's gonna be doing  some wine tasting all right yeah i got a sophisticated palette it's 91 points it's a smooth little wine 
[00:49:00]  yeah this smells like uh dumpster 14th street wait what is that  nice color it's like when i got kicked in the kidneys and was urinating for a week  all right uh thumbs up tell them to cut off six for a second all right six cut off six all right  six is off oh again we get that nice silence i like i like the hallway noise it's kind of nice yeah  little ambient sound oh my god i i see more wires how far are we taking this bernie williams from 
[00:49:30]  the yankees releasing an album or something he's playing yeah don't talk to him that he's um bernie  williams though he's been doing that's very mad and he won't answer your question yeah a jazz guy  is he is he yeah let's get him in plays jazz guitar oh wait oh that's why okay  his his wife was that one that sat behind home plate with that goddamn 
[00:50:00]  making a noise when uh the other people would come up to bat that was bernie's wife yes oh yeah  how embarrassing oh how what an annoying bitch shut up why'd he tell her stop it  she probably wears the pants in the family what's going on there can you hear me yeah i think we  hooked up too many wires i think there's so many wires now i think there's a little resistance problem  going on a few too many connections a little too much wire for the signal to travel through without 
[00:50:30]  a boost yeah i'm almost at our office which is a hunt a hundred feet or more away from the studio  it's at least a hundred that mike was not made to be hooked up to that many cables you can tell  we are way down the hall it needs an extra uh it needs some extra of voltage yes now what sam well  now everyone ran away from there everybody when i came here as i was walking down the hall two people  jumped into these voiceover studios oh yeah i don't know if they're actually recording their 
[00:51:00]  voices or not press your balls against the window like bat wings someone is suggesting we  set up detour signs so they have to come  that's funny yeah well no no one thing sam there's troy i'm right by troy's desk yeah try he's  an all right dude hey troy means the city in upstate new york come here  come here troy they want to talk a long cable 
[00:51:30]  what's going on they're setting up another wire no way for real it's going to get more crackling for  real okay they had they gave me more headphones all right there you go he's going to be out of view  now yeah because he's going around that corner he is so far away we have never we have never had  anybody this far away with a wired mic okay i'm sitting down at troy's desk with trying 
[00:52:00]  so troy what are you doing here today nope nope nope just hanging out uh join the show  opening line wrong oh um oh i'm sorry how could i have forgotten hi troy i'm sam from the opie and  anthony show we have two offices and 12 tvs so far how are you i know it's been quite an ordeal getting  them all to work but uh i guess they're they're putting the last two in right now ask if he has  any tvs i see here at your workstation you have a lot of gadgets how many tvs do you have unfortunately 
[00:52:30]  none but i'm going to come in and uh watch your guys tv if that's right well we have 12 i know i  know it's quite impressive for real we have 12 tvs seriously we have we have well it's not an exaggeration  if you count all in the studio and in our two offices we have a total of 12 flat screen hd tvs  it's crazy it's craziness and on all those 12 tvs we only watch four different channels  how many channels do you watch on your tv here at your desk absolutely none i'm staring at a uh 
[00:53:00]  profit screen right now you don't have a tv that's right i don't we have 12 screen tomorrow on all 12 tvs  i want the yule log tomorrow opie is going to play the yule log on all 12 of his tvs  are you going to have anything to play the yule log on unfortunately no they should put out in the  lobby too the yule log we have more tvs than the lobby yeah i know we have two offices i know it's 
[00:53:30]  crazy tell them we have so many tvs so the talent doesn't have to crank their necks the reason that we  have a lot of people have been saying why you guys have 12 tvs it's because the talent opie anthony  and jim norton doesn't like to crick their necks it's understandable i mean you know you got to  deliver radio gold so you don't want to hey say it's too far out if uh troy understands that you should  start telling him that we need some of his space listen troy um i see you do have a really nice station  here but you have a lot of space for one for one person don't you think yeah just send somebody 
[00:54:00]  over here somebody else can join well i mean because your desk is close to our office so if  we kind of brought our office knock this state workstation out it'll give you guys a little  more room so maybe your your office your desk here could be half the size that's fine i'll slide down  one i'll go down there oh this is thrilling banter yeah way to know uh when to you know bail sam good 
[00:54:30]  idea that's how tall he is all right right look at mars running the 100-yard sprint  mars's hair doesn't even bounce when he runs what creepy hair mars has he just ran down the hole  he was running forever what the hell is going on in this place iraq is telling me that kane  is in one of the voice booths oh we're fans of kane i know he was at uh he did well at wrestlemania  last weekend who's kane what was he doing at wrestlemania sir not kane the uh the music jock

[01:07:30]  we have some extra stuff from the old place so we may have to go ahead and take over that uh closet  for some of our stuff if you could kind of move maybe a couple of your things out we have a couple  tvs that we haven't found room to hang up yet so we may need your to use your uh area as a storage  facility is that okay that's fine i guess because all the suits are kind of been like pissing  themselves for like four months since all of a sudden it's been announced you guys were coming  here so i guess they would make me do it anyway oh what's your name my name's steve oh steve yes

[01:08:30]  of show here like yours or like howard is kind of in the back but you guys are out in front so i think  they're scared that uh as they walk by they will be harassed oh i see all right well we'll move on to  the next person but thanks for your time steve no problem all right who else is around here  i have pepsi sucks yeah it's if you're gonna drink just how far why were you drinking that i'm gay  oh i'm seeing uh okay how far we can go down because a couple of these areas are empty and that's

[01:12:00]  big fans one of the amateur interns was messing with the microphone cord wait what kind of intern  are you then i'm not an intern that's why i get to be the one holding the mic and all these people  follow me okay i got i used to be an intern all right but tell kane i'll be listening to him later  on alt nation opie will be listening to you later on alt nation also and i will be listening to them  every day fantastic good to see you you too thank you kane's all right he's all right i remember one  time we all had a little free time uh in between shows and we bumped into kane over at uh i believe 
[01:12:30]  it was show world or one of those places was he over there remember that we all ended up at some  strip club i remember that much it was me you kane i'm honestly trying to remember and i think we had  to go to work oh when uh with the the stripper with the knee jobs yes knee jobs for lunch knee jobs  that's what it was knee jobs for lunch these strippers have this gimmick where they would just 
[01:13:00]  like kind of sit you down and then do that thing where they kind of grab your legs and kind of shake  their hair on your face and shit like that and they were making believe they weren't making contact  yeah using their knee their knee would be right in your crotch area and she'd start pumping and  pushing uh against your boner with her kneecap did you dump nah very hard to dump in that uh  situation yeah it's not just laughing humsies in that situation yeah yeah i made comes in my pants 
[01:13:30]  twice due to strippers no way right through your pants once in new orleans i was down there doing  a college with pete correale and and this guy he's good though he can make you come real easy he can  just by talking to me he's so funny his act just makes me come but no it was me pete lewis ramey's  who went to the strip club and in the back it was like a tourist trap so she's giving me like 20  all lap dances and she's like for 300 we could go in this quiet room and i know it's a scam so i'm like  all right just give me a couple minutes and i had on silk boxers oh and she was grinding i'm like 
[01:14:00]  yeah maybe we can't what will happen up there like i'm just you can have a really good time  and then what does that mean exactly she had when the ass cheeks are separated over the deck and  they're moving and all of a sudden a fire hose of activity in my pants all of your silk i was like  that i'm all set and i walked out with a giant stain on my boxers and i showed pete and lewis  on bourbon street that's great that is all right the uh the silk probably is what did it right well 
[01:14:30]  when i when it happened in vegas this russian stripper they normally annoy me it was the best  lap dance i've ever gotten i got 11 lap dances from her it was like 220 and i knew she's just a  stripper and she still had me convinced that she liked me and she was kind of riding me like with  her ass cheeks on my boner and then like looking back over her shoulder at me just slowly rocking on my  cock and boy did i fucking blast off my wow it's wonderful sensitive uh boy not normally it took 11

[01:25:00]  do a talk show with three people they have a great agent why not you're doing one with three listeners  nobody cares about you how does that feel wow i didn't you know what i've had satellite for uh  five years i've i didn't even know alex bennett was doing a satellite radio i swear to god i've  never heard of him we just gave him some marketing today i had no idea no clue go ahead uh track  two i guess it's ridiculous for them they haven't been too successful in the last few years have  they i don't know they lost their fm stations yeah that doesn't sound like much success so so they 
[01:25:30]  have all this so they pretty much wound up being me yes but they're you with a bunch of flat screens  you're right you didn't do the fist on the console follow the directions in the yeah you're  right that's what they are they're me with a bunch of i want a flat screen in here but opie and anthony  are the poor man's howard right yeah there you go i wouldn't say that why because it's a different 
[01:26:00]  act thank you oh it's a different act yeah yeah howard's uh good and they're terrible you think i'm  giving them a bad time because they took our studio do you think they'll come over and say  they're happy we're all at the same place together no in fact i think that when they find  out you were saying nasty things about they'll try to get me fired well they'll first make sure you  don't do that anymore then get uh some of the bosses to say hey alex don't do that anymore uh  first of all let me interject here we don't do that no we get on the air and beat the shit out 
[01:26:30]  of you uh you then uh get beat up so badly that you usually run to the bosses and tell us to stop  that's the way it's worked in every situation we've been in we pull out the atomic bomb we drop it on  uh whoever's giving a shit and uh they turn around and say please make them stop we've never told a  fucking uh boss to have people to stop uh to make people stop talking about us and ain't happened 
[01:27:00]  we encourage our listeners to listen to your show i'm i'm i'm willing i'm confident enough in this  show yes we are to say our listeners should listen to your show and if you do a better show then our  listeners should stay there i think judging by this that you're just a cranky guy who didn't get as  far as you wanted to get and tough shit that you got booted out of your studio tough shit you don't 
[01:27:30]  like it fucking quit and you don't have flat screen no you don't 12 of them why don't you show the  counting show video on that bald head of yours i'll be pounding oh pound the studio wait till we bring  in our uh our personal tvs next bring in their extra tv from home i'm gonna roll in a big projection  television set we should hold a screen screen this whole all right back up again you rock please  yeah howard's good and they're terrible you think i'm giving them a bad time because they took our 
[01:28:00]  studio i say back up so you had to go and get that line on the radio again it was only one other line  all right sorry you think i'm giving them a bad time because they took our studio do you think  they'll come over and say that they're happy because we're all at the same place together no  in fact i think when they find out you were saying nasty things about they'll try to get me fired well  they'll first make sure you don't do that anymore they'll get uh some of the bosses to say hey alex  don't do that anymore really they do that oh yeah they always used to accuse howard of that no they'll 
[01:28:30]  do that to you oh really yeah oh hey lapdog we this show has never done that to another radio show nope  and as far as what happened with this show and the stern show look it's common knowledge he said  it on he admitted it on hannity so don't be a fucking learn what you're talking about  before you start bashing a radio show stupid all right track three why am i supposed to defend them 
[01:29:00]  they're not on my channel i i don't know if we don't defend them they'll say nasty we're competitors  we'll be on the same time right they'll be on the same time i am right six in the morning till i  i don't know something like that three in the afternoon i i don't know those shows go on forever  well that's what they need those live screen tvs so they can catch springer  because they're working while he's on  oh wait you know so hold on it has to be read do your line again and then read what's in the print 
[01:29:30]  all right or and can you read the uh yeah yeah when when it comes to that because that's really funny  actually okay um go ahead three in the afternoon i don't know those shows go on forever well that's  what that well that's why they need those live screen tvs so they can catch springer long  uncomfortable pause because they're working while he's on smells the bomb and changes the subject so  it's they really they have four in their offices

[01:44:00]  audience it was people in front of microphones doing stupid real drama and things like that  absolutely before he was around it was a comedian just stood in a room and talked to no one yeah  it was such a bad reaction the audience we should invite him to watch uh some of our tvs from outside  the class yeah see if he wants to come in and talk to more than 50 people at a time  but he walked right by why wouldn't you come in you know you're bitching about us you know who we

[02:15:00]  what's going on because we've got a lot of people just tuning in the show for the first time today  fugitive what's what's going on what's going on i got ten thousand from mel karmistan he got he stole  ten thousand dollars from mel karmistan or karmistan yeah that's a place in the former soviet union  he means that's actually mel the cop from scarface how were you able to get ten thousand dollars from 
[02:15:30]  mel because we sure can't see cuz karmistan how'd you get the money from mel  i'm gonna win when he goes to sleep oh you broke into his house while you're sleeping and you took  some pocket money from mel oh he was asleep in his office i stole the money all right so now um  so we we got to figure out who you are now what what's the other hint that you have yeah you're 
[02:16:00]  giving us another clue this hour my uncle is a police officer you're lying no he's not i'm not  one of my uncles is a police officer in florida he's a deputy sheriff in the orange county sheriff's  department of orange county florida in florida no he's not no nephew would do this you're lying  yeah definitely lying yeah that's the police officer all right so what what is your demand 
[02:16:30]  this hour fugitive last hour it was he wanted us to pour jimmy pour peanut butter because that's what  you do with peanut butter you pour it on uh sam's uh afro and then put gum in it or something yeah and  we did that and you're still not giving us the money back so now what what's your demands yeah what's  your demand this hour yeah damn it there is gonna be a guy on friday a face you know he will bring a  thing of jizz wait wait what will he bring a thing of what a cup of jizz a cup of jizz but you're 
[02:17:00]  bringing a cup of jizz to us on friday somebody you know somebody we  know we'll be bringing us a cup of jizz i don't know it's a cup with jizz in it right  e rock has to eat it with the food so you want e rock to eat jizz on his food on friday and then 
[02:17:30]  you finally give us the ten thousand dollars right right he has to do it in front of a person that  that'll bring the jizz hey uh they were telling me uh that uh the fugitive has a diabolical laugh  can i hear your diabolical laugh fugitive  uh-huh could could we because jimmy didn't hear it i i would love for jimmy to hear the fugitive's 
[02:18:00]  first call sure fugitive of it thank you future thank you fugitive well we'll uh see this person  on friday with a cup of jizz yeah that's right he will be bringing some a cup of jizz very good  very good fugitive uh now now fugitive called earlier and uh the fugitive gets a little shaken  up when things happen he he's not very sharp uh and to think on his feet so listen to that what  happened during the earlier phone call uh fugitive can can i ask you um what what borough of new york do 
[02:18:30]  you live in now no i live in queens what's happening what happened fugitive no no no nothing nothing i  actually the dog had just walked a little bit too cute dog walked a little bit  oh he's brainless please let me hear that part of the call again i knew you would like it oh my god 
[02:19:00]  how do you not love that that's why we continue with the fugitive thing because the first one was  terrific the dog had just walked a little bit too no no no back it up back it up back it up a little  little fugitive's great yeah the fugitive what's what's happening yeah what happened fugitive  no no no no nothing nothing i actually the dog had just walked a little bit too cute 
[02:19:30]  that voice sounds familiar the fugitive has called before i think yeah yeah yeah i think the fugitive  has called before he's probably uh pranked us before yeah i think so yeah that's for sure all  right sam's in here sam what do you got what's the update well we need the bobo so let's bring  everyone to the table with this bobo thing we found out that the radio world is uh going crazy with this  bit a fugitive uh bit but we got a fugitive that's uh stealing money and then the listener's got to 
[02:20:00]  figure out who the fucking fugitive is and tap him on the back and then they win like the money or  something i don't really get the bit whatsoever uh but all sudden uh we had our own fugitive calling  the show right it yes our own and somehow he's associated with our own bobo we learned  and uh the fugitive made bobo come in here with a batch of cum well i don't think that was the 
[02:20:30]  fugitive suggestion as much as it was uh danny and travis's oh really yeah they're involved with this  uh yes but um but they insisted bobo come in here with a thanksgiving dinner by the way for everybody  well well and a thing of his own cum the problem at that point the fugitive yeah danny and travis  suppose he's not bobo would give back the money that he stole from from mel's mel carn carnizan or  whatever he says card stand card card card stand and to be fair uh it was d-boy's idea for bobo to 
[02:21:00]  save his jizz and bring it in sure of course and d-boy likes a beverage while he works danny and travis  didn't tell him to bring in a thanksgiving dinner he told they told bobo that everybody would be  bringing in food and that bobo could bring the turkey uh which was a lie nobody was bringing  food and so bobo just looks silly and his mom paid 35 dollars for a turkey that no one's gonna  eat she doesn't have money to do that like who's gonna eat that nobody he's got a bag of jism with  uh he doesn't actually have it but where is he well we're talking about okay yeah yeah he's he's 
[02:21:30]  isolated that brings us up to today and what happened today with the bobo and the fugitive well uh he  called up because um you know the promotion for the other stations the uh the fugitive always calls up  and leaves clues as to who they are and uh bobo was being escorted by the fugitive and now um  um he's here uh he was interrogated yeah we told him that the nypd and kenny wanna 
[02:22:00]  is looking for him and uh i guess they recorded that right yeah i hit a microphone when he got here  we immediately as soon as he got here kenny said told bobo that he had to go into the interrogation room  which was the office and we turned off the show feed and shut the door and left him in there for  five minutes by himself then was he freaking out yeah he did not seem happy because kenny actually  has a way of intimidating people really yes uh and then kenny and i went in and spent 25 minutes 
[02:22:30]  questioning bobo okay and we got the best of the uh questioning right here bobo admits that he was  the fugitive believe it or not this whole time what i have to comment everybody will not leave this  alone the way you say fugitive whatever they are i know it's i mean if it was one two ten yeah 20  it's everybody every i didn't even notice that's how i say it i don't know say i mean fugitive 
[02:23:00]  how do you say oh wow fugitive fugitive fugitive it's like saying um i like marianne and chinger  fugitive back to the future is one of my favorite movies  all right i can't say the fucking word what do you want from me  i just had it because it wouldn't stop it's all good  what are you doing rich i was going to go write it on my list 
[02:23:30]  look i'm not i i i completely realized that i would have a list that's uh pretty impressive  over there too i'll be the first to admit that all right here we go bobo admits that he's the guy  the guy and i will talk to you and get to the bottom of this all right all right well you trust me  right yeah you trust him right yeah all right well what i am going to say is that who who you 
[02:24:00]  are on the phone hold on hold on you guys i don't know how many people i mean everybody probably know  this but kenny was a police officer he was a detective and he did this for a living for many  years what i'm hearing here sounds exactly like when i watch first 48 yeah and they drag him into  the interrogation room he is doing he's doing exactly what they do he's an expert yeah and he  he is an expert he sat in front of but i sat behind bobo the whole time and told him to just  keep looking at kenny yeah and then good cop dumb cop kenny's good cop bad person 
[02:24:30]  kenny sat right in front of bobo and leaned into him the entire time direct eye contact  dude that's how they do it it's hysterical let's start over then yeah and listen and kenny's going all  right okay like like you trust me right like trying to feel him out a little bit i've seen this a  thousand times on those shows and kenny's perfect i have a feeling he's going to have bobo admit  everything oh yeah yeah very quickly doesn't look like a guy that you could uh interrogate him and 
[02:25:00]  he could hold back no it's in the trunk i want to talk to my lawyer yeah yeah you think that lawyer  up he hasn't he hasn't mentioned that yet it's not all right here we go i just told the detectives  that i would talk to you and get to the bottom of this all right all right well you trust me right  yeah i trust you you trust sam right yeah all right well what i am going to say is that the guy who 
[02:25:30]  who you are on the phone and don't lie or i'll know that was the checking to make sure i dropped i  brought the the panel do i look like a jerk off to you no have i always been nice to you you've always  been nice to me then why do you sit here and lie to my face i'm not lying the guy daniel look at me  i will i was a detective i know that all right we know there's no fugitive we know it's you  i told the cops i vouched for you all right this whole thing was a bit that danny and travis 
[02:26:00]  all right all right all right that and that's exactly what happens on first 48 he  fucking rolled over in under a minute oh my god  what a snitch what a rat what a rat what a rat  oh is that classic i don't know with some guy named hamburger 
[02:26:30]  hamburger hamburger hamburger hamburger shot i just saw this  vouched for you all right this whole thing was a bit that danny and travis thought of  what's the bit explain it to me no they thought they thought i should do a fugitive caller bit  all right who's the fugitive  it was me they they thought i should do a fugitive caller bit they talked me into doing a fugitive 
[02:27:00]  caller bit and i was gonna they asked me to do like some kind of voice i gave him the  i gave him a little sample of that voice and that's that what happened  oh wow and he is shitting a brick in there that is so good uh point blank has the first 48  uh penis surgeries and uh hippo juice film is the first 48 chromosomes 
[02:27:30]  also throughout the interrogation process if you're listening uh the microphone caught the  meet the mets ringtone consistently ringing while it was being questioned that's what that noise is  of course uh all right it continues with this fine clip from kenny all right so you're the one  that sold the money that's what you're telling me yeah actually the fugitive didn't really  stole the money they asked me to come up with a line i don't want to hear the fugitive the fugitive  is you correct yeah well they came up with the reason why i called well the character where is the 
[02:28:00]  money the fugitive did not take the money i did not take the money well then how do we explain the  missing money well there was no missing money daniel there's money missing there there's no money  daniel yeah think about it now who told you to come up with this bid it was it was danny and travis  all right so now there's money missing yeah danny and travis told you to come up with the bid 
[02:28:30]  put two and two together yeah that's right they set me up for they're blaming you now for taking the  money we got to get the money back have you ever been to prison no would you like to go to prison no  oh my god and he's he's bad man i would not want to be on the receiving end of a questioning from 
[02:29:00]  kenny and he's sitting in the office he's after this he's asking me hey did danny and travis did they  hear when i called in as the fugitive on the air and i said yeah and he went oh they set me up  he set me up he's he's figured it out that once danny and travis heard bobo call in they went up to  mel karmazin's office stole ten thousand dollars from him from mel karmazin so that everybody would  think it was him this is like an action movie now yes i've been set up damn it i gotta clear my 
[02:29:30]  name bobo the clean bobo name all right it continues the whole thing was me to just tell  he told me to call in at that time at seven o'clock yesterday doesn't matter all right you already  confessed didn't you yeah exactly so you're responsible for the money i don't i don't have  the money or never even saw the money you think the police are going to believe that you you were 
[02:30:00]  convincing enough to fool on a you can't believe how dumb they are can you i can't believe they  fell for it why i never expected that from two guys that have been in radio since for the for over  a decade i didn't realize they they they would be that dumb to some dumb enough to fall for that  so now he thinks you guys are dumb all of a sudden this is good an episode of law and mental disorder  that's a good one wow oh who do you think is dumber opie or anthony i think i think i think 
[02:30:30]  i think obie might be the dumber one  actually come come and think of it i might i kind of think think it think anthony might be  to at to someone who was who was about to turn 18  about about two  you're talking about no you heard that bit he was talking about this is not a bit bobo 
[02:31:00]  yeah this is a real life situation yeah now i asked you a question i'm waiting for the answer  i kind of think that anthony would probably be the dumber one  he said i was the dumber one  he started thinking right you know if i was with a girl of uh you know 17 and then 18 i guess that's  what he was talking about wow i guess anthony is the dumber holy  shit oh god this is funny is the money in the back that you brought no no that's the food that i 
[02:31:30]  that that i i i brought what kind of food it was stuff for thanksgiving it because it's close to  thanksgiving a couple stuff danny and travis asked me to bring where'd you get it at boston market  how did you get the money to pay for the turkey good question my mother paid for it  yeah isn't that funny where did she get the missing money from no that was that was her money 
[02:32:00]  she did not get the money from anybody he did not get the money from anybody  wow oh that poor bastard man he uh he wanted me to tell you guys that he will be back he'll bounce  back from this he will yes where's he now he's in our holding cell holding you gotta pay the money back 
[02:32:30]  but i never stole the money you said that you did you said that you had it that that was how i how  i had to say say that to uh see that care that that was the whole line that was part of the character  there is no character it's you yeah well the character that i was doing it was me  there's ten thousand dollars missing  i never look at ten that i didn't steal any ten thousand dollars you said you did well why would 
[02:33:00]  you say it if you didn't that's what they asked me to say if they asked you to jump off the brooklyn  bridge are you jumping no exactly so you know the difference correct yes then why would you say  something you didn't do that was the thing to make fun of that you did it call is this fun no no 
[02:33:30]  i almost feel bad for him almost and we'll be back almost we'll be back with columbobo  after these words columbobo  steven s from bayshore csi moronic  law and order special persons unit  the avenging llama very nice kojack ass 
[02:34:00]  shit man and then finally  here's the last clip i i never stole the money and i wouldn't lie like that  i would they wouldn't steal money like that but you do lie you lie about not being gay  well i'm not gay all right you're bisexual would it be more fair to say more correct to say you're  bisexual oh it did happen that was only one thing that happened all right i'm straight 
[02:34:30]  you want people to believe that yeah but but you're actually bisexual say  believe that but i guess you could you could say that i would buy because of what  nothing bad happen you didn't get struck by lightning for saying that be proud that you're bisexual  saying i'm proud to be bisexual i'm proud to be bisexual 
[02:35:00]  and he's the worst man  hey he's fine  oh my god people are just saying that at this point he could get him to admit to you know anything  i was handling oswald  i mean do you guys want to talk to him before we get here should we have him make one phone call 
[02:35:30]  live on the show yes yeah i'll go grab him all right great idea man  who would he call with his one phone call  i don't know he can't hear us i'm great job kenny  could you tell him that he gets one phone call before you you know take him downtown for the  weekend okay all right yeah he's really uh he's not in a good place right now  he's really nervous yeah he he actually believes like they set him up for stealing the money of 
[02:36:00]  course yeah why wouldn't he you're very convincing comes bobo don't smile oh he's got his head down  he's just kind of yeah wow walking metz hat opie and anthony shirt like he said oh  wow this this certainly didn't turn out uh well what the what happened what did you get yourself  into bobo something stand up what did you get yourself into something happened huh what happened 
[02:36:30]  man we'll have to start this hold on i don't know what wait we need the mic on so uh what what  happened the fugitive set you up no this whole this whole thing started with a simple phone this  whole thing started with a simple phone call uh-huh a simple phone call with with danny and chance i  was talking about you know maybe i should do maybe i should spoof the fugitive right spoof the fugitive  what do you mean yeah yeah that fugitive that was called that that 90 that that hacky bit that 92.3 
[02:37:00]  now was doing right right i know i was spoofing it and then that's all well that would have been  fine but now there's there's now there's missing money yeah and then i told danny and travis i i just  gave him a demonstration of the bit right yeah i was gonna say like the whole thing i came up with was  about just sold 10 the fugitive i sold ten thousand dollars for bell while he was asleep that was how the  whole line was gonna work well it turns out someone must have actually did that well do you 
[02:37:30]  know who mel carmson is because he's not he's not happy right now he wants you to go upstairs and  talk to him well before you go downtown well i'm i'm very sorry to the guy if someone actually  acted upon trust me we've been in this in some bad situations with mel uh card stand and uh he's  not going to listen to the sorry why are the police here what's going on i know they got to bring  them downtown well something happened now you're you're you seem to think that somebody set you up  and you're taking the fall for somebody taking ten thousand dollars and it's either danny and or 
[02:38:00]  travis yeah what you don't with bobo what you don't have a strong accusation yeah and what you don't  know is danny and travis took a lie detector test that's right yeah they did not take the money and  they you can look at them all you want they passed so it's really pointing to you why are you smiling  by the way i'd wipe that smirk right off your face no i noticed they were trying to i noticed they were  trying to set me up but they didn't set you up because they didn't take the money so who well so 
[02:38:30]  who where do you think that ten grand is i don't know who took it you could probably use it apparently  a fugitive someone who was trying to to act upon what i said who's the fugitive  could be danny and or travis well no you were you posed as this fugitive guy  did you not do both voices on the phone well it was me and i did the fugitive and i just said 
[02:39:00]  and the fugitive is the one that took the money right but no no i i heard by the way  i i heard that uh that that call you let me just fucking film before your last appearance on this  show that's bullshit i heard the fugitive it was two different people i heard you talking to them  that's true no it wasn't it wasn't two different people was it was me all all this time how because  last time we talked to the fugitive you were off the bus and he was on the bus right well so how is  that possible to be in two places at the same time i was just gonna say that i was on the bus 
[02:39:30]  that he was on the bus i could tell because i heard the bus driver i heard the bus and then  when we talked to you it sounded like you were just walking down the street you don't sound like  the fugitive well i got off the bus and then i switched and that i they just said could you do  the future voice yeah you know that's bullshit it's a fugitive caller that's nothing like the  fugitive it doesn't sound like anthony we got mel card stand on the uh phone right now all right  mel card stand yes uh greg tony i want to press full charges enough of this he can't he can't 
[02:40:00]  hear you uh mr card stand but he's got uh now he's got the headphones on this is good yeah what i was  saying uh greg tony i want you to press full charges this is not a game um howard stern needed  some pocket money that is his pocket money i want this i want this prosecuted to the fullest all right  so mel wants to you want to say something to mel card stand i knew you were a stern ass kisser i did  not do this wow i'm sorry this is not a joke bobo this is not insults not a joke no time to uh you 
[02:40:30]  know well i did not i did not do i did not do this how much the future i'm slow um i i was it was just  lying you're clearly lying sir i'm not lying i just made up this character he doesn't believe you have to  talk to him like the future so he'll at least hear it oh i'll do the voice to prove it this is the  fugitive core i took ten thousand dollars while mel uh right now you're not him it's not a confession 
[02:41:00]  was that a confession you're just saying it that was me dude that was me doing that voice  no you just confessed uh mel uh we're sending him downtown so we'll see uh what the it's right  the problem is it's friday and there's no judge that works over the weekend so he'll probably be  in in uh central booking until monday but because the holiday week uh it might be sometime in the 
[02:41:30]  middle of next week before he gets out what you want to make a phone call bobo because uh your  family's going to need to know where you are they had a phone on you they kenny is he allowed to make  one phone call before you guys bring him down to the cops on the street that is his right there is  no um we're getting your phone bobo there's no i think kenny and then kenny's going to bring you  downstairs where the cops are waiting to bring you downtown for further questioning did you miranda him  daniel tell him the proceeds you were going to get an inno for this 
[02:42:00]  tell him that whole part oh what yeah yeah yeah that's what i that's what it's what i heard would  happen what doing this bit wait wait wait but yeah but you were saying that the fugitive needed  an inno to so you're trying to steal an inno to give to the fugitive then you were trying to steal  an inno that doesn't bolster your case any when you're trying to steal something else i would say  the fugitive but in fact all this time it was me yeah so when we said we wanted to give the fugitive  an inno you said as the fugitive give it to bobo so you were trying to steal to to mislead us into 
[02:42:30]  giving you an inno that was meant for someone else right to perpetuate the fraud right right  it was it was part it was part it was just part of the bit i figured i figured maybe they would  they i figured you guys would have would have enjoyed that bit that i would have maybe uh what  you're stealing from mal and then you know a crime no this was not a this is not i never even stole the  money i heard the fugitive and you both yell at the same time yep no i heard that i i never stole 
[02:43:00]  that never happened you said we love what was the thing we love oh we love oh we heard both of you  do it together that was me trying to do the thing about me and him trying to talk at the same time  that's not true me love oh and a it took me difficult what i was trying to imitate two  people talking at the same time all right bobo it's time for your your phone call yeah because  you're really going to be gone you got one call and then kenny bring him downstairs for the detectives  who are you gonna call because i ain't getting i'm gonna call a friend of mine i would call ghost

[02:52:00]  yeah he's walking  this is your first defense yeah it's your first defense right  yeah well yeah i'll be able to prove my innocence  walking to the elevator  he'll find the person that's set him up like it's like the real fugitive  he had a whole group following him taking pictures of him  you're going to ride down with him or just let him get picked up  okay they're waiting for you down there 
[02:52:30]  i will find this person  get in the elevator  i will find this person  what are you going to do when you find him  when i find him  i will beat him up  how badly  oh i'll beat him up badly  i'm talking ufc  badly  i want him to look like the guy who lost the ufc fight 
[02:53:00]  aren't you worried that you're not going to be able to fight while in jail  you're not going to be able to fight  you're not going to be able to fight  there's somebody call master poe  who's that  your old security guy that guy knew some stuff  all right bobo this is it end of the line  they're waiting outside bobo  the guy right there  the guy right there right there 
[02:53:30]  that's kenny pointing him in the direction of uh  just two people in suits  yeah just two random people standing in the lobby in suits  he goes go ahead and turn yourself over to him  so did bobo walk up to him and surrender  yeah though we ran in the elevator  so he just surrendered to two office workers in the lobby  he walked up to two random people in suits  and you guys ran for the elevator with children  yeah holy 
[02:54:00]  shit that was funny  he put his hands out and everything like he was going to get cuffed  that's how we leave it what they must have thought  and you guys came back up he's down there somewhere just trying to figure it out  wandering the lobby trying to get  find somebody to arrest them  what's two people just standing there talking to each other in their business suits yeah just  standing in the lobby  they weren't even dark suits they were both wearing tan business  yeah  fucking funny man 
[02:54:30]  there they are go ahead wow  i'm here to get arrested  oh my god wow oh poor guy i feel bad  i wonder if they took him  it'd be funny if they were like they ran a sex slavery ring  yes and they just happened to be there and they took him and you're  sold it to male prostitution  they'd see his cock and leave him on the side of the road  take him out of the van  it's functional  what is that thing i've had 48 surgeries  oh wow 
[02:55:00]  the end  that's uh and there he is like just wandering around  did anyone else hear the gulping when he was trying to  yeah  yeah  did you isolate the gulp yeah i got it you want it  yeah listen to this gulping  but they didn't say yeah because they didn't take the money  where do you think that 10 grand is  oh there's a double in there  can i hear that again but they didn't say yeah because they didn't take the money  so where do you think that 10 grand is 
[02:55:30]  i was i think i gulped that too  oh really i've never gulped that was a movie gulp like a cartoon gulp  that was like the word gulp flying out of his mouth  ah poor little feller  well that's uh  i guess that's how the saga of the fugitive ends  i think so  bobo was taken to custody by two nobodies  by two fucking people that work in the yeah one of the offices 
[02:56:00]  what did one of the uh  guys that worked for letterman say i don't want to say his name oh he's got a few big fans over  there they're right for letterman he had a really great idea he goes uh you guys want to somehow  figure a way out of it for him so that he thinks he really is the fugitive so for the whole time  he's worried like the holidays he thinks he's gonna go we would have done that if we were coming  back monday but 10 days we'll just forget and who knows what he'll do in 10 days  he might relocate no like kenny said what about florida yeah no i well when i heard that 
[02:56:30]  right right i told him look become the real fugitive you got some place to hide he goes i  could go to florida like rico rizzo exactly  we'll be right back with more of the best  four teams remain in the nba conference finals and sirius xm is the only place on radio where you  can hear every team's hometown call in the east the heat battle the pazers

[03:01:00]  area unfortunately scorch was let go before any real rock tv episodes and before the success of  oh before the success of the station before the giant success of real rock tv so he wasn't involved in  those comedic hijinks uh that you're getting to enjoy uh and he's the famous uh jock that was we 
[03:01:30]  always forget but he was either pizza or hamburger and dave douglas wanted the opposite so he said  look scorch your pizza let's say and i need a hamburger so because you're not you're not bad he's  like you're not you're not bad i'm gonna have to fire you if i'm not bad so you'd be it's like people  people love pizza but i need a hamburger so scorch uh left that could be a little how to leave  that could be a good little phone bit that we could kind of say in and out today 
[03:02:00]  how the boss fired you with their dumb analogies instead of just going you know what idiot you're  fired it's always well we never got an analogy yeah you're an asshole we need talent and you're  shit but the best one ever heard was scorch's firing yeah your pizza i want hamburger i'm sorry  pizza's good you should find someone that likes pizza because pizza's good don't don't let this be  a reflection on you and what you do you're you're great people love pizza but i'm i'm in the i need 
[03:02:30]  a hamburger i'm in the mood for a hamburger so take your fucking sauce cheese and dough and roll out the  fucking door and now scorch is pretty much delivering pizza so oh oh worked out well for oh no what is he  doing sam the beauty of um sam is his butt his butt oh yes chairless stomach little cherub um  sam worked with scorch as well yes very bizarre yes he worked with someone from our past scorch taught 
[03:03:00]  me everything i know about radio oh it tells everybody that right yeah yeah doesn't he tell  people that we ripped off half his bits and he said he thought him up and just gave him to us yeah i  thought it would what are some of the bits we took from scorch according to scorch he didn't  he's not upset about it yeah like you guys share back and forth a little bit a little back and  forth going on with us and scorch like brainstorming for instance he gave you guys doucher dressing that  you guys love right that's you guys that's we did it once as a as a as a mockery that was scorch 
[03:03:30]  of scorch it was in a homage no it was a mockery it was he also i mean one of your guys favorite  things was always feels for meals which was a scorch uh creation wasn't i remember the day we  came up with that were you talking to scorch that day no i wasn't that was definitely a scorch idea  and you know and then he said that he borrowed from you uh finding out what the caller's name was  before going on air that way when he goes on air he could say hey jim what do you have for the show 
[03:04:00]  that was an on a thing he wasn't you guys saying who the caller is wow wait we invented that who  who yes it did actually saying hi mike yeah yeah for the show but you said you were sharing with  alexander graham bell because the phone concept but he doesn't have i think radio guys there's a lot of  radio people that just go ahead hi uh serious in in our case right or hi xm but i i think i heard jocks 
[03:04:30]  like just go hey uh mike what do you got unfortunately he doesn't have the phone  screening technology that you guys have so during commercial break he answers one of the three  phone lines and uh and without doing kind of tones down the scorch voice and asks their name then  writes down on a piece of paper and then when they get back on the air that way you can actually no  he does it all during songs because he records the calls of course he puts them on hold and then he  waits and then he picks them back up so he can record saying most radio guys are not allowed to 
[03:05:00]  go to the phones live it's a no no before we get the scorch update we got a couple analogies uh for  being fired listen to this guy uh speaking of mics it's mike in albany mike hey good morning boys  good morning mike hey i had a boss tell me once the company was on a train to a new direction and they  didn't buy me a ticket that's a good one yeah oof what an asshole really all right thank you 
[03:05:30]  thanks boys let's go to it looks like mousy in alabama alabama mom mousy hey hey what's up boys  yeah i was like going from the parallel i was told yeah well you know when you guys marry sometimes the  marriage works and that's the kind of girl you want but you know we need a different kind of  change of you know women you're a lousy lay uh so leave what's up boys i think this next call leads  to the scorch update uh sam it's ken in new hampshire ken listen to this you think real rock tv's bad 
[03:06:00]  i'm gonna steal sam's uh little idea and update for you all right um in manchester and hampshire  scorch actually does a tv show like you guys used to do called pretty fucking good tv watch  it and he broadcasts from a chinese restaurant in town isn't it p uh it's pfg pfg tv yeah pretty  good starring scorch yeah i guess obviously this caller is one of the pfg disciples 
[03:06:30]  pfg disciples here we go to pfg disciples what happened to the kingdom of nakedness  i don't know he's always moving he went to mansion well when he went to syracuse  it became totally new no the naked militia naked militia naked militia yes which he said he was  doing naked militia and then you guys started doing ona army but it's cool don't worry about it  you hear that i know you're reading i was reading the uh pfg tv thing yeah just say that again in case 
[03:07:00]  you didn't in case you were worried or whatever he started doing naked militia and then you started  doing ona army but it's cool i mean you guys are all it's cool okay good as long as he's not mad  he's cool jesus christ don't worry about it is there are there any clips of scorch on that uh site danny  um because oh oh my oh my goodness gracious well the thing is what brought it to my attention he's  been doing this for a little while yeah on public access um and at least ours was on regular tv it was 
[03:07:30]  i mean a spanish speaking well that's true you know channel but and i was looking on his twitter  and uh he posted an article that was published about him uh talking about the great success of pfg tv  and i was going through it and some highlighted some of the good parts yes some of it uh  didn't necessarily ring true or was things that i could have i could hear scorch saying yeah uh for 
[03:08:00]  instance you remember when you used to call this program and say he was getting signed to xm in a  matter of months yeah you couldn't talk about it right well in this article it says uh after a year  of doing pfg tv on public access uh we're the first locally produced late night talk show in the area  scorch said it's very humbling but it's very exciting at the same time then he told the reporter now  scorch said he's on the verge of signing with a network he is reluctant to discuss it in detail 
[03:08:30]  at this time however of course he is god damn scorch so i'm thinking it could be nbc it could be a  network yeah yeah you're talking uh the big ones the nashua telegraph actually bought into his craft  jesus you don't think he's almost signed with the network i first met scorch in the month of august  at which time he said he would probably be going to xm in the fall but that i could come with him  oh wow that's nice how many years ago is that this was 2000 and uh this was 2005 
[03:09:00]  it's true and then uh as hold on sam the phone just oh no everyone knows a little something about  scorch yeah john in manchester hey how you doing guys hey another pfg cycle yes  i wouldn't call it that but anyways i want to correct that last douchebag um pfg tv has been  down because the restaurant that he was broadcasting from had a fire a while ago and he's out of business 
[03:09:30]  well can't he find another chinese restaurant it's covered in the article actually uh oh oh it is  sam yes god the restaurant that he was in did in fact burn to the ground but he is now broadcasting the  show uh in the in the very technologically advanced public access studio do you think that he's uh  humbled and excited at the same time i think it's kind of yeah it's it's it's a mixed emotion 
[03:10:00]  oh my god because he's humbled like he has to take a step back to look at all the success but at the  same time he wants to move forward with this thing i i beg you i gotta read some of this stuff  sure all right uh the show is inspired of course the show what is it again p pfg tv pfg tv starring  scorch the show is inspired by david letterman's longtime network show but rather than featuring  a-list stars scorch looks more locally for his guests it's a choice local cops full  full full full philanthropists thank you artists chefs and even a dog psychiatrist have spent time on the 
[03:10:30]  big blue couch alongside carpinelli yeah that's nick carpinelli who's that it's a sidekick it's  like the annie richter chatting it up with scorch and then anthony yeah scorch is also spent oh wait  uh okay we're pretty good uh where we are right now scorch said but his ultimate goal is and it's good  to have a goal yes it is is to infest the living rooms of america as a network regular with no holds  barred brand of humor i'm certainly not against going to places that carry the show and doing live 
[03:11:00]  appearances scorch said he has done i've done a total of three shows from my basement and more  people have seen it than all of scorch's p what is it pfg cycles oh pfg tv oh yeah yeah oh pfg tv  yeah i thought you meant the people who watch pfg tv oh yeah how by the way update on uh his twitter  how many how many followers he's actually at uh 39 followers oh 39 followers oh okay a hundred after 
[03:11:30]  that yeah yeah a thousand thousand something uh 39 but i mean that's something twitter's on the way  out anyway you missed towards the end by the way the show is taped at 8 p.m mondays and scorch said  anyone looking to be part of the audience is welcome the audience can also get some face time on tv as well  since scorch ends every program similar to saturday night live with the audience joining in the 
[03:12:00]  farewell wave from the set so you could be on tv but i'm looking at this and the production value is  zero it's much different than snl it's scorch holding a camera technically this is what this is one of the  pfg tv podcasts that he posts every day that we've listened to before pfg tv the tv show yeah is a  totally different animal well can i see some of the i mean i want to see production value here there's  yeah see danny's got the intro right now all right there's a plane obviously filmed just for the show 
[03:12:30]  yeah yeah there's a plane landing in an airport uh looks like miami or something no that's new  hampshire with palm trees manchester looks like miami or vegas what is he doing yeah that's vegas  oh vegas no i think that's manchester the mirage the mirage no mirage new hampshire why does this  intro show vegas this mansion it's not insane at that hotel it's planet hollywood and vegas 
[03:13:00]  and now and now it's raining now this i think there was a cut to make it look like  oh yi dynasty that's the uh chinese all right here's tens of fans here's the uh pfg site the live  audience smart to keep it tight yeah look there's no one behind him there's empty pool tables in this 
[03:13:30]  bar if you'll notice the audience shot transitioned to a shot of the same audience members yeah  all right now he's live in the restaurant oh that was good  it's empty there is no one there i can count one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one  twelve twelve people twelve people yeah this is an early show before the restaurant burned to the ground 
[03:14:00]  help me get the pfg stipos in the car dude there are 12 people there  a wheel of meat this is gonna be a cult leader did you hear what's coming up on the show what  wheel of meat wheel of meat some of that no-holes barred you with we have got someone the transitions  are akin to a 1986 wedding video of meat also we've got our house band legs zeppelin 
[03:14:30]  leg zeppelin the caravan and yeah that's the rules  to that feedback wait somebody lower that or something  special musical guest vegas temper  oh uh can you pause every second i want to talk about i'm getting some info here take the wig writes uh 
[03:15:00]  oh i kid you not he probably has shots of las vegas because manchester's nickname is  manch vegas baby sam knows manch vegas  shut up manch vegas baby no doubt you know this guy writes i live in new hampshire i hear it all the  time yep manch vegas manch vegas do or die what do you mean because it's a party town  this is too much i love it i can't get enough of watching scorch do this all right let's go back to uh 
[03:15:30]  what pfg tv tv the tv show what major network is he talking to with this yeah exactly  maybe it's my network oh well  god bless him man god bless the scorch he's in like a suit jacket i never gave up  wow how much pot does he smoke a lot of pot yeah the wheel of meat what's hanging up there it's like 
[03:16:00]  a tarp that's the wheel of meat no i think those are no that's a tarp and those are i think uh pfg  logos for a little name recognition as you and now the pfg logo is stuck in your head is it not  it is not we'll give the link to this particular video in a little bit oh please people have to  see this but go ahead danny let's get back into it yeah  so before i go into further i want to talk about a couple of things anybody hear about the swap team 
[03:16:30]  that went through manchester all right it is monologue wait wait did you hear about that  it happened outside my house it happened outside my house i'm freaking out hold on hold on hold on  all of a sudden obviously like many talk shows you gotta start you introduce who's going to be  on and things like hey you do your monologue and uh he's doing his monologue and it's very local  he keeps it local for the local people at the bar match vegas and he probably had like an idea 
[03:17:00]  there about uh the the swap team did you hear about it and someone ruined his whole bit  it ruined the whole joke it was outside my house no no it was outside my house because that's my  joke the guy ruined it he ruined his whole fucking joke fight fight because it really happened outside  of his house yes and it didn't happen outside scorch's house one of the 12 people at the taping  ruined it for scorch god damn 12 people here and one has got to be regarded to happen here what the  fuck that was his setup it had us have my house and uh he stepped on his set the guy's not talking to 
[03:17:30]  the guy at the bar scorch is doing a monologue danny back that up please oh wow slightly okay  here we go the crowd must the crowd must be miked by the way this is a 10 minute video so oh settle in  boys settle in yeah just we thought we were gonna go so we won't go through it all it's like no settle  in settle in because this is like just like david letterman without the david and the letterman  part it's cold but plus tarps right it happened outside my house it happened outside my house 
[03:18:00]  i'm freaking out i go bring my dogs out for a walk all of a sudden i see these guys dressed i thought  it was columbine i see these guys dressed up in full like uh camouflage while you can see their eyes  and i hear them say we're gonna set up right here the first thing that came to my mind was columbine  my house is in trouble i'm probably gonna get killed right here all right second thing that came  yeah you got it danny it's very funny yeah it's very funny he keeps referencing columbine but there's 
[03:18:30]  not a school nearby it's and it's like swat guys swat guys dressed differently columbine had like black  trench coats these guys are in camouflage camouflage they're they probably have swat written on them  i'm sure there was a van somewhere yeah yeah the swat guys parked three blocks away i'm thinking  columbine it couldn't be further from columbine the ice cream man came i heard the bells i was thinking  columbine yeah but you guys remember columbine it's not no school it's it's the it's the authorities 
[03:19:00]  that dress differently you remember how funny columbine was when it first happened though right  oh the scream laugh riot well let's see how he uh brings it all together oh my god back it up  slightly yeah columbine this is twice terrible delivery mine was columbine shit my house is in trouble  i'm probably gonna get killed right here second thing that came to mind is uh oh maybe it's the dea  okay so as of about 8 30 this afternoon or 8 30 like an hour ago i was actually still pulling  balloons full of crap out of like my backyard because my stash was god because i ain't gonna get 
[03:19:30]  talk to you yet i can do it to a good stash you know what you put it like  wow oh it's happening since 8 30 this afternoon this afternoon i mean a few minutes ago just ended  you know who's a big fan of scorch for real colin colin loves colin would go out of his mind for 
[03:20:00]  this yeah he would go out of his mind he sure would he would probably make a trip just to see  a taping of this maybe me and colin go to manch vegas sometime manch vegas we should drop in on a  taping road trip he was supposed to he was supposed to come in studio one time and bring a sidekick  paulie with him and they were supposed to leave in the middle of the night and he called paulie 
[03:20:30]  called him at like four o'clock in the morning like dude so we're going today right like right now so  we can make it for the show and scorch goes no no can't go sick can't go sick he was sick and then  paulie walked in on him like uh maybe later that afternoon smoking pot with all his friends  paulie like he's just scared to come on this show my stash uh my stash is out there and uh you know  there's all my shits in there yeah yeah oh god but seriously folks oh yeah when we play it again i want 
[03:21:00]  to hear 8 30 this afternoon you like the 8 30 this afternoon off by six hours  here we go i was actually still pulling balloons full of crap out of like my backyard because my  stash was gone because i ain't going to get in trouble yet how many people are doing a good stash  anybody enjoy a good stash uh-oh you know the joke bob for the crowd reaction how many people what else 
[03:21:30]  was going on man i mean like i was talking me and nick were talking about this about the whole  elvis thing why whatever happened like why is so cool about elvis you know why is there no  why doesn't charles nelson riley ever get seen at a 7-eleven you know what i mean i'll take a  i'll take a burrito in a honcho magazine you know what i mean what's up with that why is it always  elvis elvis i'm not no fan of elvis i love charles nelson riley not that way he might have liked it but 
[03:22:00]  not that way so anyway we got a good night in store tonight tonight because uh i want to introduce uh  nick and jolanda and jeff warrants and to start things off tonight we have a pfg cycle that is the  ultimate pfg cycles where is brian is brian out there come on up here brian yeah my mother would  take me out of her will where is she would never have sex with me again if i did if i did what brian 
[03:22:30]  did look at that ladies and gentlemen that is bft to me no he didn't oh my god no this guy  stop the tape no this guy did not do that the guy's name is probably paul francis garrison  it better be oh it better be he that's got that almost looks like a fake tattoo well you know what  i'm noticing is that it's it looks like a tribal band around this guy's arm and pfg is kind of in 
[03:23:00]  the middle surrounded by ink so what he could have done hypothetically is gotten the tattoo and then  for the show and then he could just have that the pf and g filled in and it looks like a regular  tattoo yeah that is kind of true but what you you think this guy actually got a pfg tattoo yeah i've  been looking at artists because i think my next uh tattoo is going to be pfg oh it is huh i'm gonna  get a tramp stamp a tramp stamp all right let's hit the oh please back to the tape 
[03:23:30]  everybody have a seat relax enjoy yourselves everybody have a seat enjoy yourself  my peeve stuff a border  because what i want to start talking about today plenty of seats uh brian brought up a great uh great  question to me the other day uh brian said why do you do what you do and why do you love doing uh  what you do uh so i'm gonna answer the question i'm gonna give everybody here the chance to answer  the question i love doing what i do it's gonna sound really hokey and gay but you know what 
[03:24:00]  and i want you guys to turn around i love doing what i do you guys you know what i mean no i said i  love doing what i do because of you guys all right all right i i i i i'm tapping oh wow  your next life on the compound you gotta do that you gotta go i should i do what i do  for you guys in this business we call show holy fuck he should have said because of two guys this 
[03:24:30]  this store this is the size of his audience  for you guys and then you hear oh and and then he goes no no for you guys that means please applaud  oh remember when he says jerry lewis the people actually thought that you were putting up the real  rock tv because you thought it was good and not for the sake of irony sure this is scorch 
[03:25:00]  yes he actually is doing this no no clue he's getting a network deal we might not have had much  of a clue when we originally taped but now we have a major clue scorch has been in the business for 20  years finally branching out to tv looking at some networks looking at what are we looking at exactly  twitter and stupid youtube i love how his cameraman cannot pull a focus for the life of him either  blurry tarps it's just the tarp is all blurry yeah talking in the background it's all chatter there's  no light well they're trying to order their chinese food did you hear when he was thanking the crowd for 
[03:25:30]  saying i'm doing it for you did you hear when he said and i want you guys to turn around for this  which can only mean that people were sitting at the bar with the backs that's right he did say could  you turn around for this because they were all trying to get drinks at the bar  earth and that's right the first time he said it nobody clapped and then he said i'd do it for  you for you guys wait a minute produced in the queen city at the manchester community access media 
[03:26:00]  studios pfg tv currently airs in 49 cities across five new england states it's got to be true scorch  said it's got to be true what a what a load of shit that is i'm sure this journalist checked every  single city and and this is from the burnt down chinese restaurant right yes well yeah now that  restaurant is burnt to the ground i want to hear what it where he goes uh because people were asking  me something no one was asking you no one asked him why he does you know scorch why why do you do what 
[03:26:30]  you do well let me tell you it's the people and you know i'm going to tell them tonight i'm going to  break the news to him that it's the people if they'll turn around from the bar yeah excuse me  excuse me could you hey could you guys turn around here for a second he's probably getting the cadence  all wrong when they asked and they probably went up there and said why do you do what yeah yeah yeah  why are you doing this yeah why why do you do this and why does he tape on a monday at 8 pm 
[03:27:00]  because that's the pfg day i do what i do for you people for you i do it's for you  please rewind a little bit oh please rewind that because i got to hear his little speech  and then his his speech his non-reaction from the crowd and then his forced you better react to me 
[03:27:30]  uh plea we were talking uh the floor yeah get the whole thing with we were talking you know  and he sat down for the special moment yes yes he sat in the chair because we're going to get serious  the jokes are done he is  i did my elvis joke and my stash joke my columbine reference time to get serious  what you do uh what i want to start talking about today uh brian brought up a great uh great 
[03:28:00]  question that's not a great question uh brian said why do you do what you do and why do you love doing  uh what you do uh so i want to answer the question i want to give everybody here the chance to answer  your question i love doing what i do it's going to sound really hokey and gay but you know what  and i want you guys to turn around i love doing what i do because of you guys 
[03:28:30]  you know what i mean no i said i love doing what i do because of you guys  when i was a little kid i was a little fat picked on little kid you know what i mean and uh now  uh i would like nobody i'm going to school with you know what i'm looking good people look at me  i'm looking good i'm feeling good i got these fat slobs that i went to school with has anybody  noticed that the girls you go to school with that were hot are now fat yeah i noticed that scorch i 
[03:29:00]  noticed that now fatter slobs nobody's gotten better but you yeah yeah so anyway yeah i love doing  what i do because i'd like to see the uh first-hand reaction of the people of the person i love to be  able to be me i like this he is a fucking he has the cadence of jake lamotta when he was a nightclub  entertainer he's just an idiot he also has a little rupert in him a little though there's a lot of  rupert pumpkin delusion all right scorch it's very ironic six weeks i can't give you six weeks you 
[03:29:30]  went to tears to come out of my eyes come on jerry  hey liza you look great liza you always does ladies and gentlemen doesn't she look great every  time she looks younger every time jake i gotta do this now jerry you you look good too what what yeah  yeah yeah yeah he's he's fucking delusional it's it's he just did a whole bit about how now he looks 
[03:30:00]  good and everything yeah yeah but he developed a reputation around the radio station for coming in  every day with his clothes completely covered in dog hair and smelling of canine urine  he also new cologne he also did a bit on the radio uh with paulie in which he argued with paulie  that dracar was indeed a good cologne because it was his it was his cologne of choice and one that 
[03:30:30]  the women enjoy wasn't dracar one of the ones that were in the dispensers in the men's room if you  needed cologne dude we should put his radio show on this channel for sure i am not even joking i am  fucking captivated by scorch right now we got a real live rupert pupkin this guy is rupert  pupkin needs some exposure scorch on a saturday night virus holla let's do that all right i'll get 
[03:31:00]  with scorch him sitting in the network office oh wait oh wait is that sealing cork  fucking rupert pupkin he's gonna show up at your house oh yeah  anthony i got the work right here don't maybe me and you could go over some stuff before dinner  mr komia he's touching everything everything i'm having a hot attack over here  all right uh back up slightly there oh it's it's fantastic this good news we got four more 
[03:31:30]  minutes this pompous fucking speech he's giving and then you go in the office and find maybe oh  for sure maybe a special clip for everybody like he's a legend we haven't heard uh all right because  this is just the beginning of the show some of his bits include nick who we talked about in the article  he does a drink like like an alcoholic beverage oh and the segment is called nick's drink to help you  think or at least sink the pink does scorch have to rhyme everything well no nick's nick's drink to 
[03:32:00]  help you think or at least sink the pink  what does that mean it's a beverage it's a beverage there's also before we continue yeah one of scorch's  bits is the munch box oh what's that well what he does is we got to get him on 202 i love it or 197  whatever the fuck you're listening what could the munch box pick he has a a briefcase that he opens 
[03:32:30]  it's a metal haliburton type briefcase oh actually it's probably the case the camcorder came in with  those metal camcorder cases um and there are food products in there for instance it could be breakfast  cereals or little debbie's snack cakes ah and he'll usually have three different types and he  will have previously surveyed the audience as to which they prefer over the others oh and he'll first 
[03:33:00]  announce the three separately then put them back in the briefcase and then announce which are the most  popular that's the next box that's that's a waste of time if you even think it  it's like jaywalking kind of except oh all right let's go back please more pfg oh yes see the uh  firsthand reaction of the people i love to be able to be me i like to get paid to be me however little or 
[03:33:30]  about you know how a lot we get paid i enjoy a paycheck to be me i like making a living out of  having fun you know i mean there's how many people in there have fun at their jobs yeah you know but  they're clapping we have a lot of great time so uh it's supposed to be if you say how many people have  fun but plus we'll go no none of us yeah no no you're you're the lucky one scorch we all do we  understand you get to do this for a living and you're blessed but we don't you know but he's 
[03:34:00]  like who has fun they're like all of us you could have done any of our jobs had fun too yeah we're  new hampshire we all have fun jobs and i just want to say that we were wrong and you scorch you were  right holy shit how bad do you want to hear his show now on 202 dude slash 197 i am going to watch

[03:35:00]  carpinelli ladies and gentlemen whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what are we supposed to do when i say  ladies and gentlemen nick carpinelli you say what there you go that means so much to me you guys are  awesome uh the reason i do what i do is hi nick i know he said something about being hokey and stuff  but i've got two kids they're how long is master problem and i want to be remembered for doing  something okay i don't want to be the guy wait a minute hold on did i just hear right yes the 
[03:35:30]  reason he does what he does is because he has kids and he wants to be remembered for something he  wants that he wants his kids to go to school and be able to say my dad is nick carpinelli from pfg tv  scorching sidekick holy uh slick rights listen to everyone just socially talking  while he's talking yeah kevin from connecticut when does he play the hit song i'm in new hampshire 
[03:36:00]  bitch  match vegas no one cares why he does what he does no one asked no one cares sick bastard  from new hampshire scorch sounds like the speech at the end of rocky four  we could you know get together and do this maybe the maybe a few more people can and if a few people 
[03:36:30]  can then maybe like the whole world can and that's pfg and that's pfg the whole world of pfg disciples  wow let's go back to nick getting very serious this is what to be remembered for doing something okay i  don't want to be the guy that was you know i was uh i was claiming his uh pool no i don't be that  guy one of my kids be able to go my dad spoke probably no we're not talking about anthony okay 
[03:37:00]  i just want my kids to be able to be proud i want my kids to be able to say hey you know what my dad  was nick carpinelli from rock 101 or nick carpinelli from these guys the way you try to be dramatic when  you're 17 and drunk i want people just to know no one cares dude you gotta make a mark in the world  and you know be remembered for something or else you're just gone man forever man we're all just  dust in the wind shut up it should be noted by the way that he has a black vest and a turquoise tie 
[03:37:30]  yeah he's horribly dressed for a tv appearance i'm getting sad because there's less than three  minutes i know i'm getting so sad oh there's a lot there's a lot there's many more clips oh it's  fantastic yeah i continue i just want my kids to be able to be proud i want my kids to be able to  say hey you know what my dad was nick carpinelli from rock 101 or nick carpinelli from  the mill or nick carpinelli from pfg tv no matter what i want my kids to be able to say you know 
[03:38:00]  what my dad was that guy that's what i want that's what makes me do with it wow nick was my very first  intern at rock 101 in 1980 so oh scorch one day i could be nick carpinelli you could you do what

[03:54:30]  sending this out to scorch this morning  you you you  danny's doing the dance  clapping his hands over his head and his gut was hanging his  fucking t-shirts tucked in i do that around my house it's just so much fun it's fantastic 
[03:55:00]  well were we uh we were going to move on but this pfg tv we got to do one more segment  our old pal scorch we worked with him at aaf in the boston area easily 10 11 years ago pfg tv  cigars and scotch is calling it calling it pointless fucking garbage tv  that's not what it stands for no i know sam we're going to move on but he uh teased the wheel of meat  so we have to he's also the guy who uh who sat in the coffin for you when you guys were too afraid 
[03:55:30]  to do it thank god for scorch guys i have some great news yeah uh i'm reading the uh description of  this particular piece of this episode oh and not only will we see wheel of meat but we will also see  nick's drink to help you think or at least sink the pain oh thank god now i could find out what  the hell that is really thank god and and there's another uh piece of the article that we need to  read sam yeah definitely which one of the scorch has also spent time paragraph okay that's where  they uh they try to give you a little bio on scorch in case this was a big article on pfg tv 
[03:56:00]  that made the national telegraph national telegraph.com scorch has also spent time as a wrestling  manager with wwe that would be the world wrestling entertainment yes he said wrestling was another  thing that was on his bucket list and after attending former wrestler killer kowalski's  list and after attending former wrestler killer kowalski's training camp many moons ago scorch found  that he could take a fall better than many in the business he even did a brief stint acting as 
[03:56:30]  captain lou albano's up and coming son scorch is lying he never was involved because i remember  scorch wanting to get into the whole wrestling thing back when we were at aaf and he never he  was always talking about how yeah i got a call from wwf and there's yeah yeah he's never spoken to  anyone in wwe or wf and he's never ever you say that scorch is lying he's never been a part of that  organization scorch is a compulsive liar he's probably never even gotten like uh did he go 
[03:57:00]  to killer kowalski's uh school he could have because anybody can go i mean that could have been  and as far as the captain lou thing has he ever taken bumps in the wwe no no he's never been in  the awa or no any of those leagues no he's been a stint he's been in gyms high school gyms has he ever  met captain lou albano the only way that that part could be true is if somebody did it at one of those  high school gym shows the same way you know i you know the same way i could have played captain 
[03:57:30]  lou's up and coming son captain lou it's still real to me man it doesn't even say captain lou was with  him they could have just introduced him you know okay he did a brief stint acting as captain lou albano's  up and coming son he could have done that at that bar right like it didn't mean it was with the wwf i  guess that was before vito carlucci his wrestling character well perhaps yeah vito carlucci 
[03:58:00]  was scorch's wrestling character you say was in a past tense which i find strange it's still  he's still believes he's vito carlucci is scorch's uh wrestling character as a matter of fact he did  at least two wrestling gigs in syracuse as a manager well i uh i apologize then i think squared  circle wrestling 2 cw 2 cw yeah that's where he's at 2 cw all right let's get back to pfg tv starring 
[03:58:30]  our old pal scorch boy the wheel of meat the wheel of meat wait welcome back to pfg tv show scorch  that's that's me and now this is what i've been looking forward to i've been playing this game on  the radio for years and years and years but this is the first time i've actually brought it out live  first time because this is bfg tv the tv show and this is the game that we call the we have got on the 
[03:59:00]  wheel today we have got for you a piece of beef teriyaki ladies and gentlemen let's hear from beef  teriyaki come on what wait wait wait he's gonna make he's gonna make people cheer dude there's like  eight or ten meats on this thing easily is people gonna have to cheer for every meat yeah  what an asshole all right it stinks we'll die for that at least we think it's a cow 
[03:59:30]  chicken teriyaki and a pork strip so the rules are well this is going to spin the wheel of meat  uh if she doesn't guess by the sound of nick because nick is going to spank his meat  now melissa has to guess the sound of the meat she knows now it's a one of three chance  now if melissa can't guess the sound of nick spanking his meat 
[04:00:00]  then she's going to have to lick his meat which would be just like old times in melissa's house  so it's all oh storage no old bars  what we want to do now is spin what the real  oh my god there's no one there 
[04:00:30]  do you know who he looks like right now when he's got his hands up he looks like the guy that  fucking snake plissken killed with the bat escaped from new york  i wish he was  fucking a nice bat with a nail  that is so bad he's trying to get a bigger crowd reaction but he's got everybody which is about 12  people reacting yeah he's still looking for more noise yeah he's working in the crowd  there's nothing else he's getting the maximum value out of the people in there so it's an 
[04:01:00]  excuse to say spank your meat on a radio show you guys you didn't steal this one too no i think you  guys were stolen now they spin the wheel you spin the wheel and the wheel stops then you take without  telling the listeners or in this case the viewers you got a blindfold whoever it is i guess without  telling them what meat it is you take that meat off the wheel right then you slap the meat against your  hand or the console or whatever but you say now i'm spanking my meat oh god 
[04:01:30]  because that could mean something oh jimmy that's crazy it's got to be something uh oh  it's like double entendre right without the uh entendre or the double wouldn't all meat sound the same  as you spank it against your hand well that's no i mean that's one of the challenges that there  are subtle differences between beef teriyaki and chicken teriyaki you have to guess right now  why the wheel why not just have someone turn around say i have three meats here i'm gonna uh 
[04:02:00]  spank one and you have to guess because then while you're waiting to find out what meat there'd be no  sound that goes oh all right and a lot of people claiming it's uh colorado brennan and many others  there's a ripoff of wheel of fish wheel of fish from the weird of the weird al uh yankovic uh movie  no uhf oh really meat it's wheel of fish did they well but yeah but scorch scorch has been at this for 
[04:02:30]  a long time there's a good chance that him and weird out used to kind of go back and forth with  ideas yeah yeah i actually uh wrote a lot of songs for a weird out i said i said al you can  have that one yeah you take that one you take the eat it one amish paradise eat it one and make  millions off it yeah go ahead he's a good guy eat it jesus i i i i could listen listen to this all day  uh scorch all right let's see how wheel of me simply the best yes okay you have a choice of pork 
[04:03:00]  strip chicken teriyaki or beef teriyaki what do you think it is can i taste it oh here's melissa for  you know what if it's meat oh just let me taste the meat got it it's either black white or indian  john stossel looking motherfucker is that exactly what he looks like okay pork strip okay chicken 
[04:03:30]  teriyaki or beef teriyaki give her one little lick give her a lick of the meat yeah right here  what is it it is a portion of this yeah pause this wait so she actually the woman has taste buds  this is not an exciting game is this a tomato or a piece of popcorn 
[04:04:00]  fucking horrible his humor back to raging bull it's it's la mata when he's pretending to sneeze  as they're film filling the champagne glasses that awful oh boy did i ever it's terrible did i  ever tell you what we used to say whenever one of the bits worked in the studio and we knew the bit  worked because all three phone lines lit up wow and when that happened uh well i guess paul and me  started doing it uh ironically but scorch started it where all three phones would light up and scorch 
[04:04:30]  would go turn to us and go this was not on the air this is just him as a human being yeah looking  at us and go oh looky looky miss cookie why didn't you shoot him when he said that because our bit  was working so well we had three people calling the radio and you knew you had radio gold yes  oh wheel of meat was always a lucky lucky miss cookie type of day really oh yeah 
[04:05:00]  looky looky looky miss cookie okay let's see how he wraps up the wheel of meat we'll give you a prize  later that fire  she knows her meat she knows her meat  we still have got legs and zeppelin coming in  i wish it was great white  i wish it was great white  and thanks game to you guys the pfg cycles  we'll be back right after this  holy 
[04:05:30]  time now for our next drink to help you think or at least sink the bait  here it is  very simple one tonight people we've got one that's going to help you out a lot here  apple tini it's big with the chicks pay attention here we go we're going to shake it full of ice all  right we got the vodka could be absolute could be three olives depends on what you get you off right  a good healthy amount because it's the 
[04:06:00]  little apple pucker to twist it up just a bit oh yummy that would make the apple  he's making a drink apple martini i wish he was whipping up the same thing they had at the jones compound  i like it here we go  i bet you guys didn't know how to make an apple martini  you just made a drink on tv that'll help you sink the pick where's the twist yeah 
[04:06:30]  ah the problem is there's no twist here's how that would be perfect if the next cut  was a fade in to his pickup truck wrapped around a tree  news footage  news footage of blood on a pole from too many apple martinis all you see is a  fucking turquoise tie with a branch through it unknown radio host exactly 
[04:07:00]  that's fucking horrible john tuturo hair  a lot of people are saying you can find the wheel of fish uh clip on youtube and it's  not quite let's go to rich in baltimore rich you're on the opian anthony show hey what's up guys  hey hey you missed it he said uh hey i'll get you a prize later  did you know you didn't have  oh dude i'll get your prize later let me explain something about scorch  if you say i'll give you a prize later means he doesn't have anything to give away he  was the king his briefcase that he brought to work every day was full of people's names 
[04:07:30]  and addresses that he had written down because we had no prizes but he insisted on doing a contest  every day and they never got anything none of them ever got a thing because why would  rock 101 the rock 105 the dog have any prizes to get out he's not even on rock 101  no now he's on rock 101 back in syracuse he was on rock 105 the dog but the next bit look  i know we were only going to do one but it's the stephen king haired guy yes and i have to hear 
[04:08:00]  him redeem himself what he does because he's fucking this guy is a perfect parody  what a complete his fucking hair this guy is fantastic here's here's wheel of fish  a lot of fish it's a wheel sam with a lot of fish on it yeah but where's the meat  well what do you do with the wheel of fish i don't i i saw uhf years ago yeah i don't remember  the it's a whole different deal maybe on instant feedback or other idea things we can find out uh 
[04:08:30]  back to the stephen king yeah let's see what stephen king guy does for his big segment here on pfg tv  he's the announcer oh oh wait a minute  oh my god see see he doesn't have a band there and you said there's no twist 
[04:09:00]  all right you gotta pause it's too fucking wait so legs of zeppelin isn't a no zeppelin no legs  zeppelin i really thought it was going to be a female zeppelin yeah i just thought it was like  a cover band yeah with some kind of thing but see what are we looking at well they're playing  obviously the real led zeppelin yes and the visual is a woman's knees and on one knee is a guy a face  of a guy and on the other one a face of a girl it's painted on the knee caps yeah it's a guy as a man's 
[04:09:30]  face and a woman's face on each knee and as the music is playing you know how you can kind of flex  your kneecaps and make a move a little bit so the faces kind of move very little bit and that's the  bit legs zeppelin  tank rizzo writes he just made a drink on tv and we're listening to him on the radio make a drink 
[04:10:00]  yes exactly he was like an asshole it's a disaster it's pfg tv the tv show yeah okay let's watch the  knees sing see how long this goes on for this whole thing we might have to fast forward the knee is lips  lip-syncing so people radio are just listening to zeppelin right now yeah right all right fast  forward imagine knees how long does it go on oh my god look how long it's going yeah okay 
[04:10:30]  come back from what by the way well they it's vegas temper  what's vegas temper it's one of the hot match vegas bands right now oh it's a real band yeah  or is it legs again 
[04:11:00]  oh this stinks  wait how does the band manager tell them that this is the gig yeah good news bad news  the bad news is it's a scorch's tv show the good news is it will allegedly be shown on a television  somewhere at some point i like the moldy ceiling above the scorch's head on the stage where a pipe  has been leaking for about 15 years it's black mold yes hey sam is the same restaurant that scorch worked  at uh to make extra money doing wings danny yeah hi really well hey you gotta work off the studio space 
[04:11:30]  one day good old syracuse scorch came in  bragging to paulie and me that he had a new business opportunity which was one of the mexican  he had made a connection with the owner of one of the mexican restaurants in town and they were going  to let him work in the kitchen for a couple extra bucks under the table  cooking wow just another thing on the bucket list yeah i've always wanted to i want to be a dishwasher 
[04:12:00]  you sure the deal he made he wasn't going to take all the  shit from mexican food to make a tv show out of it jesus wow  see scorch should write a book except he would just lie in it yes he should actually tell the  truth in a book and it would be interesting he is so full of shit yes he lies constantly constantly  lies let's uh fast forward here through vegas what is vegas temper 
[04:12:30]  all right vegas temper what song are they singing another cover or original  all right local piece of shit uh god showing i think in uh or showing i don't in north carolina  writes who opened for leg zeppelin was it guns and toes

[04:14:00]  i don't know how did i ruin the show by saying that  i guess that's it for today pfg tv's over keep in mind i mean there's very many episodes this is  episode one we were watching you just fast forward to the end i want to see how he closes his show out  that's all i want to see is him saying his good nights i guess it's probably episode one  segment four because i don't say anything else so let's let's give that a shot all right let's  see what we got  all right we did that right i think he had vegas temper play like three times 
[04:14:30]  oh oh yeah that's a good yeah you want to what is that what is that it's some kind of um uh  animation yeah that was done with uh it looks like photographs that were cut  i'm getting out of this crummy little town i'm gonna see the world you wouldn't consider  staying here and running the bank would you hells no hey your dad died and we need you to stay  here and run the bank crap you want the moon i'll throw all around it and pull it down  how are you two going on this here now honeymoon we're getting out of this crappy little town

[04:43:30]  competitive business you want to fucking sell magazines you got to promote what how do you  think you're getting people to buy fucking paper magazines in a computer internet world you got to go  on the radio and talk about it and make people like you and want to see you what do you think that  just you're gonna say hi i'm on the cover and anybody's gonna give a shit well i think that was part of  the problem is you know she wanted to promote the paper thing and there was the old internet yeah  but you know what oh jesus i was also talking oh god damn you danny uh she went she wouldn't like this  one wow we were talking about the she did a penthouse video that's all part of penthouse what's the 
[04:44:00]  problem i'd shut up i'm watching the video oh sorry yeah all right when we get in uh laney's got to get  her out of here because uh yeah oh boy laney's very good we like laney a lot very much does a lot for  for this radio show holy mackerel maybe she's mad because she's never recovered from that  she's coming out okay she's coming out all right and everybody boo  boo hoo bye

[04:45:00]  she was making out with some broad on howard's show yesterday oh yeah screw oh was she really  what's up steve you know you weren't there i was gonna ask was she upset after yesterday's uh  show that she did um lady was very apologetic first of all because laney has we have extensive  conversations before the girls ever come on they know exactly what they're walking into  and um they do she actually gives us like a breakdown of every show we're going to do and  what is to be expected on the show and it says we weren't even doing it no i know i know i know and  tay's you know tay's last appearance was fucking huge it's all over the goddamn internet now and 
[04:45:30]  you know and it went perfectly and and laney's baffled by this and she's very apologetic because  she didn't she wasn't expecting this because her appearance she said um i think it actually says  i actually have my paper in there that breaks down like what the show is and she said it's a man  it's a dude show it's guys being guys and they're going to kind of be raunchy and so we definitely  know everything we're walking into every time we go on to every show because laney is very thorough  about that kind of thing yeah let's play her little video response to her appearance on our show 
[04:46:00]  because it's so cute in so many ways is it weird to see a video of her without a batch of seeds  flying across it i know yeah it is saving private ryan footage hey where's sam uh did sam put the video  up on youtube the video is her saying that she's pissed off and then and then her breaking down  and it ends with her leaving the studio and then leaving the building and everybody booing her oh
