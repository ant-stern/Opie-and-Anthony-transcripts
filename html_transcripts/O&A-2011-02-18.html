<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of New York's erratic weather, prompting anecdotes from Opie about strong winds affecting his neighborhood.  This transitioned into a conversation about building construction and wind tunnel testing in the city.  The hosts then launched into a highly offensive critique of Lady Gaga's recent fashion choices and public appearances, specifically her "condom dress," dissecting her interviews and speculating on her motives.

Comedian Patrice O'Neal then joined the studio.  Before the interview, his song "Pull Your Fucking Pants Down" (featuring DJ Troy Kwan) played.  The interview covered Patrice's upcoming Comedy Central special, "Elephant in the Room," detailing its creation, content, and his anxieties about his career beyond stand-up. He discussed Comedy Central's standards and practices, his experiences with diverse audiences, a recent period of depression and self-reflection leading to a temporary retirement, and his relationship with his girlfriend, who composed the music for his special.  The impact of Comedy Central specials on comedians' careers was also discussed, along with observations on audience demographics and racial dynamics in comedy clubs.

Bill Burr joined the conversation, adding his perspective on audience differences between white and Black audiences and engaging in a lengthy discussion about sports, particularly hockey (which O'Neal disliked), basketball, and baseball,  including criticism of NBA officiating and player behavior.  Triple H (Paul Michael Levesque) then appeared, sharing anecdotes with O'Neal about their experiences in the WWF/WWE, including stories about Vince and Stephanie McMahon. Triple H also promoted his new movie, "The Chaperone."

William H. Macy (actor, *Shameless*) joined the existing guests.  The conversation focused heavily on Macy's experiences filming *Shameless*, including humorous anecdotes about his character's intoxication,  on-screen appearances (often unconscious or asleep), and the creative freedom of cable versus network television.  He also discussed his roles in *Boogie Nights* and *Fargo*. The conversation touched upon film marketing, the changing television landscape, and the comedians' personal lives, including Macy's wife Felicity Huffman.  A significant portion of this segment involved a discussion about dogs, punctuated by humorous and offensive comments. Triple H made a brief reappearance before leaving. The segment concluded with promotions for the JÃ¤germeister Music Tour and Patrice O'Neal's Comedy Central special.

A later segment included Sarah Lazuri as a guest, demonstrating chicken soup making, which prompted much mockery and crude commentary from the hosts.  The hosts and guests then discussed the unpleasantness of matzo, personal experiences at social gatherings (including a Grammy's party and a Harry Potter movie premiere), opinions on various celebrities' appearances (Jennifer Hudson and Jennifer Tilly), preferences for body types (described with offensive terms), movie and TV show reviews, and Twitter.  Patrice O'Neal and Bill Burr were mentioned again, promoting their respective upcoming projects. The segment concluded with a discussion of the hosts' upcoming shows and their social media strategies, employing offensive language throughout.

[00:03:00]  little break from uh from maybe it'll melt the snow i don't know it because uh well the city is a  different story also because uh a lot of the snow i don't know where it goes i think it's just people  trotting upon it and whatnot it goes down in the sewers yeah yeah it goes down in the sewers we got a lot  of sewers but it's melting because i guess it's warmer in the city i don't know what the fuck it is  most of the snow's gone because out by me still snow really everyone's lawns really the streets 
[00:03:30]  are clear and and shit and it's starting to melt but uh my backyard's still pretty much covered in  snow yeah so i'm waiting for that all to melt we set a record uh the snow stayed on the ground longer  this season than any other previous winter yeah over 50 days or something really now i yeah we got  this national show so people are laughing at us but for the new york area we get these storms and  they're gone in two days tops usually maybe you go maybe you go a week with snow on the ground  maybe not now but 50 days this year must be that global warming or cooling or something whatever 
[00:04:00]  whatever the fuck is going on i'm not quite sure what it is yeah i don't know either i'm not sure  which one went to a hockey game last night so i'm a little tired oh yeah how'd they do uh yeah you  know they the bruins kicked their ass but uh so the the game you go to you finally go up to go to  game and it's nothing like these action-packed fight islanders win nine to three whatever it was  a shit game but i uh the first minute there was a great fight i got a great picture of it tweeted it 
[00:04:30]  and i even wrote it's going to be one of these games and guess what it wasn't one of these games it  wasn't no and then we brought in i think our sixth goalie of the year and the guy was me and my brother  were there i took my brother and his kids and uh the guy looked so nervous well in goal he probably  was he's the sixth goalie they've used this year and you could tell he's like what am i doing in an 
[00:05:00]  in a nhl game i have no business being in an nhl game i'm gonna hummer you could just tell by his uh  body language he was like holy shit what am i doing here last week i was playing high school hockey  somewhere now i'm in the nhl probably was i don't even know let's know what his background is yeah  yeah probably probably literally has no business being in the goal uh i don't know i mean he actually  played pretty well but it didn't matter at that point standing on his head nah nah the bruins uh just  kicked our ass and whatever but i did get to sit behind a guy that had one of those skull tattoos 
[00:05:30]  what's that about what oh shaved head with a skull tattoo yeah yeah but like like uh grapefruit  side size uh skull tattoo on the back of his bald head yeah it's odd and he was he was really  annoying me so i was gonna fucking do something with him man we were gonna dance i'm telling you  right now use it as a target for mars laughs i was gonna fucking dance with this guy dance take it  down to street level i'm not down on the ice i'm not scared of fucking skull tattoos on the back of 
[00:06:00]  the head you might be no it's kind of scary i was scared out of my fucking mind yeah because that is  his sleeves are probably coming up like swastikas and stuff because i i'm known for like bothering  people on the street making videos now and and and the only thing people got on me they go oh if that  was a tough black guy you would have said that exactly yeah i admit it we all admit it yeah we we  size up uh the person and if if we could take them then we're gonna mess with them that's that's 
[00:06:30]  human nature yes of course i'm not gonna do the same thing to some fucking gangbanger on the streets  of new york you're right you're fucking around with a cat feather on a string you're not gonna do the  same thing with a tiger exactly you've got to pick your battles and then the dummies that uh leave  those comments they would do the same thing of course they would we all just size up the people and  then decided if we can fuck with them we're gonna fuck with them a little bit yeah right yeah so guy with  the skull tattoo at the islanders game he could have been in my way the entire game i was gonna  say shit that's just how it goes as you walk through this world it's basic human nature right 
[00:07:00]  from bullying on the playground up to uh making videos out on the street you know you don't pick  the strong guy even real tough guys they walk around go oh fuck i ain't messing with that tough  guy or i ain't messing with that guy but a little old asian lady fuck yeah exactly she's easy  fuck yeah as she blows past your building yeah i know you would think it would help other people  but i gotta get good video i'm telling you when it finally goes down i can't wait yeah that sounds 
[00:07:30]  like a place i'm gonna have to camp out for a while out yeah but the old guy rolling across the road  last time like fuck why did i have my camera out i couldn't help the guy he was already gone yeah  so i don't freaking know i was i was i don't know how i've i've gotten into this uh a fashion thing  really well it's over i guess you're all in with the fashion well no did you go to another fashion 
[00:08:00]  show no uh let's see the um ivanka helsinki ivana helsinki her lot her fall line op is out oh nice  what does that mean it means that uh they take all the models and gave them marge simpson hair  oh really like why like what why can't you make models just look really hot they're hot to begin  with so why don't you just fucking pretty them up a little bit and then send them out there why do 
[00:08:30]  you have to make them goofy i don't know what that there's some kind of logic to that and i don't  even want to know the answer i don't know yeah i don't want to know but it's like all right we got  a bunch of these girls they're they're they're hot let's fucking twist their hair up into literally  a marge simpson hairdo it's like twirling around and sticking up not frankenstein no it wasn't  bright of frankenstein i mean which is more frizzy right uh uh this was a it looked like a hornet's 
[00:09:00]  nest really was on top of every girl's head they took their hair and actually made it into that  huh if you go to my twitter you could find a picture um but it's really why do they do that  i don't know just let them wear their hair down just let them wear a t-shirt with no bra they want  to walk out there a little like fucking boy shorts they want them to all look the same  yeah like that's no that's it that's like it's a big beehive hairdo thing on every single girl 
[00:09:30]  that's hair that's not a hat wow that's weird it's the oddest thing that's so weird i i don't  get that world at all man i i don't either and the girls they can't smile or anything why can't  they smile i don't know they're just supposed to look all snotty i would assume because they  don't want you taken away from uh the clothes but yeah but sometimes that attitude but the hot girl 
[00:10:00]  does take away from the clothes to begin with so you gotta like make sure she doesn't smile to take  too much away from the clothes but the thing is when they get to the end of the runway where you're  supposed to you know that's when they're standing there and looking yeah you're not looking at the  clothes you're looking at this like looking through you i thing and and and they're just standing there  with that fucking fuck you face on it's the oddest thing i don't i i think because a lot of the  designers have no clue especially the male designers no clue what guys find attractive in a girl 
[00:10:30]  because they they don't have anything to base it on but like um i was gonna say real guys which  fuck that's not nice but let's just say straight guys straight guys they don't go to these fashion  shows no so it's for for gay guys probably and uh big mogul female but you know fashion divas or  whatever who i think i i are are lesbians i would think a lot of the designers because they they come  out at the end with all the the models and they give a little wave and stuff right and you look 
[00:11:00]  and go whoa i mean yeah they they all look like uh like lesbians it's just a real odd world just a  world you don't understand i don't get it uh fashion week's over so i guess i'm done dealing with  do you get do you get the lady gaga no i don't get the lady gaga at all she uh she wore a condom  dress they're calling it or something did she did she really but you know we know we do know a 
[00:11:30]  little bit about music and we do know a little bit about about pop music what i don't understand  about lady gaga it's very simple she's actually very talented she's doing madonna impressions  she just looks like a goofball she's trying too hard with the gimmick tree right there's some  musicians i i'm trying to think of one in the past that did this type of stuff because they know  their talent wasn't as good it was good enough to get in that world uh and then they uh would  would do over the top shit like this to just be noticed a little more but lady gaga could just 
[00:12:00]  fucking sing her pop songs and she would have her audience that's why it doesn't make sense to me  she'd still get the audience it's not like one of those uh singers or pop stars that can't sing  look at this picture of her wearing this uh this condom dress outside gma i think it was yesterday  yeah you kind of see the faces of the people around her they're kind of laughing at her yeah  they're laughing not with her they're laughing they're kind of they're kind of thinking what  we're all thinking what a goofball she's laughing too in that friggin armored car yeah she's driving 
[00:12:30]  to the bank she's making a shitload of money so what she's making a shitload of money but so what  do we know but i don't know it seems like she's trying way too fucking hard you know how she  must have smelt after taking that rubber dress off i mean honestly nice right honestly right  i think um sweaty and pissy like that pissy strong pungent smell it's rubber it's a rubber dress 
[00:13:00]  and what do you do with the rubber dress how do you what does she what does she bring it in the  shower and wash it oh you could do that what do you do with that is kind of handy you could just jump  in the shower scrub your pits and just like get off and shake like a dog and it's dry i don't give  a fuck how much money she has if i was single and i fucking showed up to take that fucking thing out  to dinner i'd be embarrassed of course you would even if it was lady gaga i'd be like come on really  you'd have to constantly say it like people would look by and you go hey it's lady gaga i'd be 
[00:13:30]  mortified and and and you're talking about the the the condom suit dress she's wearing well what  about that comment on the hat right what the fuck is that the the dress i don't even know what it is  ridiculous hat it has to have a strap on it just so it stays on our stupid head it is just about  one of the fan hats for a dallas cowboys game where you wear one of the big styrofoam cowboy  right it almost looks like a big over-the-top cowboy hat you're right but then if she turns the  the wrong way it looks like that dumb building in australia the uh the fucking opera oh the opry 
[00:14:00]  house the opry house the only thing missing from that hat is a skull and crossbows  yeah it's a pirate hat there you go it's a pirate hat as well our gaga a fucking parrot on her on  her shoulder an eye patch and she's perfect she will probably do that someday look lady gaga's a  pirate today wow she's so odd but you talk to the kids they're all little monsters man they love  this lady gaga she's so eclectic i got i got a niece or two that are all in with this lady gaga 
[00:14:30]  i just hope fucking little girls don't start uh uh dressing like this what is that it's she's  got an oversized button that she's wearing as a hat but it's her made out of like her hair it's  supposed to look like that's not her hair no no it's but it's supposed to look like it's that  supposed to be an over-the-top button yeah it's a button and then it's like how big is the button  it's it's twice the size of her head easily and then it's in the way so she can't even see she  doesn't have to she doesn't have to not people guide her it's it's like medium pizza size it's 
[00:15:00]  like a 14 inch pizza on her head yep like it's just you just people are laughing at you now here's  one thing i've noticed we're getting a lot of gaga exposure yeah where she's on all these shows and  everything uh she was confined pretty much to award shows and videos things like that uh still  photography and she could really fake that she looked good but now when you see her on these  talk shows you realize wow she's pretty ugly she's really ugly she's got a goofy fucking face on her 
[00:15:30]  she's got a great body though man you see the body at the grammys yeah yeah you think she was wearing  panties i think she's uh i think she's pretty good if she was wearing panties they were just  a tiny little patch thing yeah man she probably doesn't huh she probably doesn't wear panties no  she doesn't look bad her face doesn't look bad in that last photo like every once in a while she  takes it uh then you get that where she's wearing her kermit the frog dress with his head on her head 
[00:16:00]  she looks like larry bird in that picture she really does not look good there oh she's got a frog on her  head and then other pictures where you know she's got the bangs down to her eyes and she's like got a lot  eye makeup that looks good but lady gaga got no makeup i guess she doesn't care that people are  laughing at her i guess that's what it is wow that is her she looks like a guy going through a sex  change that's a guy right that does not look good uh lady gaga was on gma here live with us this

[00:21:30]  not if there's a big loaf of bread on it a pigeon cannot poke his beak through your skull  you sure maybe if he goes into a death dive right and pulls the wings back and reaches terminal  velocity and hits your fucking head beak first uh then maybe sounds like a case for the myth  busters yes oh we're the myth busters san francisco let's give him a call get him on the line  let's get him on the line i certainly don't think it's gonna happen i don't want pigeons 
[00:22:00]  poking holes in his fucking skull well and his skull's gotta be thicker than the average yeah  you gotta remember that the brain cavity is a lot smaller can we do the fugitive can can i ask you  um what what borough of new york do you live in now now i live in queens  what's what's happening fugitive what happened fugitive no no no nothing nothing i actually 
[00:22:30]  the dog had just walked a little bit too cute the dog walked a little bit  the best part of that is how long it takes him  to realize nothing the dog walked up the dog anyone else they would start that first word  and go oh fuck what am i doing i gotta stay in character but two sentences later he finally  realizes i don't know that's the shit you cannot get anyone to act you know i couldn't come up with 
[00:23:00]  an example conway uh tweety on uh the twitter wait tweety yeah that's funny okay with an underscore  and tweety spelled different so no one's gonna find you even though i just fucking promoted you  you gotta make your twitter name a little easier and then you get a little promotion hey uh um i said  lady gaga doesn't need to do this shit because she has real talent her songs are very catchy in that  pop uh pop music world right sure and i was trying to think of somebody that might not have as much  talent that dresses up to get a little more exposure and people talking uh bajork oh bajork 
[00:23:30]  bajork is a good example she was big on that she wore some weird shit she kind of did some of that  lady gaga stuff in her day yes and she wasn't as talented as lady gaga so you almost like okay i  understand some people would beg to differ she had a fan base i understand but she was uh you know  talented you can't argue that she was nowhere near the as popular as lady gaga is today she was a  little more out there uh than lady gaga is she wasn't a pop hit she wasn't quite as mainstream 
[00:24:00]  right yeah that's true but i mean i mean look at the weird wacky hair that looks like mickey mouse  that she did one time yes did that and the swan dress and the swan dress of course but she didn't  commit to doing it every single place she went always no it's just dumb like she was dressed normal  when she was beating the fuck out of a photographer yes uh at an airport she was dressed like a regular  gal who beats up photog beats up photographer no no one makes me laugh about those people 
[00:24:30]  she wishes that she could beat up a fucking photog now yeah she's dreaming that that could happen  again it's like please i go through the airport no one gives a shit no one has picked up a camera as  she walked by in years yes but jork here's more lady gaga on gma an artist an activist you see yourself  as both yes i'm most certainly an activist for equality and an activist for um use protection  and social justice and i want to see more and more organizations like the mac aids fund prosper 
[00:25:00]  worldwide it is such a beautiful organization and i'm so blessed to be a part of it as a woman from new  york and as someone who uh feels very in touch with young people i and and you know it's funny  because when i created the color of the lipstick you know taupe is a funny color because sometimes it  can look very white and it can and it kind of only works with certain skin tones and i wanted to make 
[00:25:30]  a taupe color that a a woman or a man of any skin color could wear and it truly is that you have achieved  that what's she talking about it why isn't robin going what are you talking about yeah what are you  saying what's she's proving that she is a fighter for social equality because she invented a lipstick  color that people could wear no matter what their skin tone is or sexual or a man could wear it too  a man could wear taupe i would wear taupe lipstick oh of course the only time we'd all have taupe rings 
[00:26:00]  around our dicks yeah homo gotta stay here somehow what is it like a what color is taupe it's probably  like a beige so then why don't you just have your lips but no because it brings out something or  other brings out what the inner gaga why are guys wearing lipstick unless they're on tv they're  fabulous they were born that way you know what i mean oh hey hence the song oh i forgot that is  the name yeah yeah you mean express yourself express yourself yes taupe one more one more clip from 
[00:26:30]  lady gaga she's gonna whine her way through this interview oh she talks about the egg  oh the oh wait to hear this all right wait to hear this fucking lie oh no a lie coming down in  three two one i'm gonna be they're screaming at me ask about the egg ask about the everyone is as  fascinated about how you entered the grammars you do make an entrance as you did here at gma how long  were you in the egg i wasn't there for three days what do you mean she wasn't in her egg for three 
[00:27:00]  days three days no you worried she was incubating no she got in there right before the red carpet  right before they loaded it into that stupid with the u-haul truck or whatever it was like a white uh  right like white delivery truck or something yeah the problem with that statement too is also on the red  carpet they said before the grammys they said uh yeah she was in that egg for three hours yesterday 
[00:27:30]  three hours she wasn't in the egg for three minutes i was in the egg she probably wasn't even in the  egg as they were driving to the grammy but they said we're here so you better get in your stupid egg  they said that she rehearsed her grammy performance the day before the grammys and just stay in the egg  so why would you stay in the egg for three days if you have to get out to practice but maybe that's a  good point maybe she rehearsed inside the egg she didn't she didn't stop buying into her silliness  she might have she wouldn't just say that three days 
[00:28:00]  what did you do see they're laughing at her not with her aha she said three days that's stupid that's  crazy no one would do that yes what did you do in there for three days i was i was viva glamming for  three whole days and you know because i wanted to have a rebirth and i think the universe needs to  have a rebirth i think we all need to be inside a vessel for three whole days thank you how about 
[00:28:30]  uh inside your fucking nasty vessel hey lady gaga people have to work they can't hang out in yeah  yeah exactly let's all just hang out in eggs because lady gaga thinks the universe needs it  well a rebirth a rebirth there's well we do have a three-day week three-day weekend coming up and i  think i think for the good of the show give me a goddamn egg i'm in all staff and talent on this show  should sleep in an egg for the three-day weekend and come back as a new better stronger 
[00:29:00]  rebirths opie and anthony we put bobo in an egg all right we can start with bobo three days  for the show for the show for the bit for the for the for the show for the show all right i don't  want to be the egg all right i'll sleep with an egg all right right yeah i can make it in no homo  it's for the bit for the bit for the bit for the bit i think i can stick it i can stay today  is she gonna have little girls all over the country uh hanging out in eggs now i hope so does 
[00:29:30]  she really have that big an influence with with what she's saying like in preaching i don't or is  it just posters are up on the walls on girls rooms it's like she wants to think answer that i think  she's so profound when britney spears was really hot yeah an influence on the girls because they  started dressing like her but you don't see little versions of lady gaga no no no you can't just buy  that shit if you go to she sells lady gaga costumes now yeah costumes costumes it's the s and the t 
[00:30:00]  it's not like just being able to get a catholic schoolgirl uniform put that on yeah hike up the  skirt i don't know i went to a gaga show and saw a lot of little monsters dressed up yeah i bet how  stupid does that look it looked great it was a celebration of life is that where you got your  shirt madison square gaga where else am i gonna get it uh i could think of a lot of places you get  that one says right on the shirt where it came from let's uh let's let's see uh she wants her  one to be in an egg for three days doctor's migraine caused tv reporter slurred speech huh 
[00:30:30]  she had a headache that's a hell of a headache that's a headache headache making you talk some  fucking archaic language uh bertation bertation  universe needs to have a rebirth i think we all need to be inside a vessel for three whole days  thinking about how we can love ourselves more protect ourselves more live life with more passion  and look not outwards for validation but inwards look inside of yourself to your spirit and your 
[00:31:00]  you shut the fuck up maybe if you listen to what she was saying is is just such a  fucking phony and so she tries to come off so deep and profound and with causes and like she's got this  passion for humanity and it's so shallow it's just like i'll put a condom dress on and say i'm against 
[00:31:30]  hiv there's no depth to anything she's saying i'm gonna say we need to be in a vessel in an egg for  three days so can we we can be reborn it's this babbling shit no one's ever gonna do and they don't  even call her out on it no but isn't it nice to know there was some symbolism behind the egg at the  grammys but that's looking on to the inside for validation and not looking outside to other people  she's making a fucking spectacle of herself and so people look at her and and she's not looking 
[00:32:00]  inward she this isn't for herself right she's not dressing like this for herself walking around the  house like that doesn't she ever leave the house and go wow how am i gonna sit down today yeah half  the shit she wears you can't even sit down i can't go to the movies with the giant horn hat with a giant  devilly twisted furry horn hat no one behind me can see right that's not fucking courteous these  are the problems where the when i wear the rings of saturn yeah i'm gonna take up four seats on the 
[00:32:30]  airplane that's not courteous it's not courteous to anyone these are the problems with being a  performance artist in this day and age is that what she is a performance artist that's correct  everywhere she goes she's exhibiting herself does she just drop hats wherever she goes oh like that  big huge over the top horns slash looks like devil's egg uh devil's legs i should say double  legs hat wouldn't that just fall off i don't know how half that shit stays on how does it stay on  after that bobby pins that's right gaga pins i would say 
[00:33:00]  a gutter nail right through the fucking top of it she should come out with a line of hat pins  oh yeah yeah i mean she's got so many crazy hats people wondering how they stay on she can make a  million bucks hat pins here is this oh it's not enough with my hat pins when will she go away she  just keeps putting out hit after hit though she's gonna be so she'll be around yeah did you hear born 
[00:33:30]  this way another number one hit that's her seventh number one hit jesus seven that's unbelievable  hey the hiv is not the number one killer huh uh let's go to dave in virginia day for snot  yeah it's not even close it's number six number one number one killer is heart disease then you got  cancer you got stroke it's if she had a uh you know the internet and the egg with her three days  she could have looked it up in google in 30 seconds no it's for me well i was i knew that but it's kind of 
[00:34:00]  hard to dress as a um as a lipitor tablet yeah well she did dress like the inside of a heart one  time with that bloody oh did she you know the red the red weird that's a good look because we have  to look like carrie after she got the blood thrown on her fucking dress thing we have to identify heart  disease so i'm dressing up like um a stent  she's just a weirdo yeah there's nothing about there's nothing i don't think there's anything 
[00:34:30]  wrong with being a little weird but you know you don't want to be a weirdo though she's a weirdo  she's a weirdo weird she's not quirky she's jerky well she wants just a jerk she wants to not only  sell records but be as famous as one can get she's pretty famous she's she's but that's because  of the outfits she's pretty fucking famous but she wouldn't be as famous without the outfits yeah  but you could start i don't know about that that's what i'm trying to say we wouldn't be talking about 
[00:35:00]  it this morning if she didn't have yeah but we're not talking about doing all the talking though  seriously now if you've got number one hits like that you don't but she wouldn't have them you  don't need a dress like that well if she would no that's the argument i'm making today sam i don't  think she would have no she has enough talent where she doesn't have to do all this lots of  people have talent you need a funny outfit or some kind of funny outfit madonna did a little something  here and there but nothing like this well madonna did some goofy things but then she was always  reinventing they talked about her reinventing herself will gaga do you foresee her reinventing 
[00:35:30]  herself at some point yes i do i believe gaga will at one point drop all the silly outfits uh  before she's 30 she's 25 now within the next five years she'll drop every silly outfit you think  she'll see him she'll wear like pants suits everywhere pants is smart pantsuits yeah like  hillary clinton but they'll have a little style to them a little pizzazz like big shoulder pads or  something we'll see wearing that all right listen why don't we uh take our first break  we got patrice o'neill into the studio what's up patrice we're gonna take a little break and then

[00:40:00]  laughing my balls off first five minutes it's just strong and it stays that way the whole  fucking uh show funny shit you're you're dealing out shit to people that and they have no idea what to  do but it's it's fucking um it's like endearing like you're not you're you're pissing women off  you're pissing some bitches off in that audience but the guys are howling laughing and the girls are  laughing i've seen it i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna actually plug something like plug plug i've i've 
[00:40:30]  done a lot of shit i'd never watch what i i get at some point i get sick  watching myself do something i watch this because i was editing it also i watch this every time and i  watch it as a fan of watching it and i gotta step out and go oh shit that's me yeah i'm i'm on top of  my game on the special absolutely i feel like i am i feel it's just the right amount of um  cutesy horseshit right uh and just the right amount of what i what i do you know i try to 
[00:41:00]  you know because it is comedy central yeah and uh you know they but there's a girl named uh joanne uh  i don't know how to pronounce her last name but i think it's greek greek grugioni i think how you  pronounce it but she's been as a as a uh executive very very very uh i have to give her credit man yeah  because she she hasn't been a douche she's been very and that's all they have to do is not be a  douche isn't that but she hasn't been don't be a douche she's been very she's been very good about 
[00:41:30]  this because i think she's she's a fan you know she likes my comedy and she wants to see i you know  because we talk a lot and i trash a lot of comics to her and i trash a lot of people that comedy central  push and you know so i'm like what about this one and she if she thinks they're funny she'll have  that you know we have a good rapport she's not like acting like an act like a little punk she's  all right man and she don't let me scream at her and yeah i like her so she what she did was uh i gave 
[00:42:00]  her the first like draft of what i was gonna do but i was doing it in the clubs and i it was a it was  in uh it was in bananas right like oh shit at like midnight so i had to be funny and do the special but  i had to be funny in front of these fucking working class people in poughkeepsie that happened  they don't want to hear about my fucking that my i'm working out my special yeah so i had to be  like really horrible but joanne fished through the shit was like this is hilarious so let's figure it 
[00:42:30]  out and and even the only thing that um standards and practices did that bothered me is um  um they let you say a lot of shit so i didn't really like they came you can't say fuck you can't  i want you can't say pussy but there's a lot of context like right there was one thing but they  kind of fixed it where you i they i was doing a bit about you know going going going you know raw 
[00:43:00]  right right they they're like well they bleep raw so i'm like well raw is you know this is pretty  vague and they said don't say stick it in so i didn't say stick it in you'll see me fucking  seriously uh thinking sometimes in the special uh a little bobbling because i'm getting ready to say  i have fucking ass cheeks and some i just can't change it but you know all in all man i'm proud of  it but you know some fucking club owner in houston not club owner but he's cool guy but i'm i'm like 
[00:43:30]  remember that ice storm i was how was that ice storm in houston fucking look at you you flew  at the worst time possible these motherfuckers in houston here's what killed me houston shut down  that weekend yeah people came out to see me i was very happy with houston man but people came out to  see me despite the fact that houston shut down for the threat the idea that two inches of snow was 
[00:44:00]  coming right well that's how it is down but it didn't but it didn't happen but the idea of  it shut down freaks out people cabs everything sure so i'm sinecco i called him the day before this  ice storm i called him and said man this this is you know trees would what would glisten it look like  glass yeah yeah look like things were in glass means that's just coming down on cars and power lines and  people's heads i said listen can i reschedule i said my special i said listen i thought it was an  actual good i go my special is coming out right let's reschedule for after then we can probably 
[00:44:30]  get more people in the club yeah he goes smart move he goes nah why why in that specials mean  nothing because to him it's he didn't say that did he abso-fucking-lutely he actually said specials  mean nothing and quote quote end quote see that's that's that specials mean nothing that's because too  many uh too many guys are getting specials he said chelsea he says chelsea handling means more  like i go okay that's great but it it just fucked my self-esteem up yeah like because it makes me go 
[00:45:00]  how can i be excited about this fucking thing yeah yeah but the problem that but the problem is he's  sort of right let me explain there's a lot of guys getting specials that don't i mean i'll turn on  comic central i'm not gonna call out anybody and and you say you see somebody go i'm gonna check out  this guy and it sucks the specials suck but yours is is way better than that you're not in but but  but unfortunately hold on unfortunately this guy has lumped in that whole fucking leak 
[00:45:30]  that's the problem right so because you know why wouldn't they though that's what i'm saying  you know that's what i'm saying so he's sort of right unfortunately as much as you want to get mad at  him but i mean with that said this special is going to do very well for you and comedy central  the beginning is cool you look all badass and that slow motion shit there's a douche chill moment  motherfucker there's a douche chill moment in that in that fucking beginning really which my my i have  to give my credit to my woman she actually wrote the music really yeah she did the music because 
[00:46:00]  they was asking me all kind of shit what do you want to fuck it my girl writes music damn  wait she actually wrote the music she didn't pick any any music that's on there is just she wrote it  oh you wrote it she produced it you are fucked if you break up wait wait more than wrote i she  composed you know produced whatever just heard her song she's a musician yeah i didn't i never knew  that plays guitar and that's pretty cool she works hard because the song is damn yeah the music's really  good so what's the douche chill moment when i look up my hat's down and i look up like hey it just made my 
[00:46:30]  stomach turn but everybody vetoed me and said oh that's cool as shit but i'm like it plays good  for you to look at it you can't you can't step out of yourself and look at it but that's the only  douche chill moment i had it looks pimp you look fucking pimp on that it's it's slow motion and you  got your fucking sharp hat on and shit it works they definitely works they did and and the thing is i 
[00:47:00]  never wanted to do one of those um do-it-yourselfers yeah some people do it do-it-yourselfer and it  works out well i think little kev did a do-it-yourselfer and it was big and yeah  williams did a do-it-yourselfer i don't know how many do-it-yourselfers work out yeah but  common central pay for this shit so i'm hoping that they trying to get their investment back  yeah i'm saying no it looks it looks good it's funny as fuck man really funny i and i've seen you  quite a few times in the clubs and stuff and uh i mean still when you're telling a story 
[00:47:30]  right when you think you know where that fucker's going you'll say two words that just take it in  another hilarious direction like it's not expected no one expects you to say it you say it it's like  all fuck you absolutely assumed you were going somewhere you go somewhere else and it's fucking  hysterical yeah really good really good i was at the taping too the women were enjoying it as well  yeah they really were i was there's a way i've been doing this for years there's there's ways  where i can attack women and divide i've seen you i've seen you vicious this one wasn't as vicious 
[00:48:00]  not only the material was not my attitude i get i put some cherry flavor in a little bit of it  right you you softened it up a little bit just a little bit so they can digest it absolutely this  was stuff that you can't get by like women just don't like anything that has to do with cheating  right right but you don't want to hear it they didn't want to laugh but you you made them laugh  that's that's important and they were fucking laughing that day man they were they was uh you 
[00:48:30]  know how much weight did you lose fucking doing the special i saw you backstage and you were drenched  from the lights and the whole fucking thing plus you had the hot jacket on yeah that wasn't too bad  though i know i i ended up like how do you guys deal with that do you fucking just have two  outfits you have a top yeah you have to always bring two outfits yeah and then uh you know you have those  towels on stage and and i don't move much use most of it from uh uh the first show or did they uh  mix and match no see that's what people don't understand the show you was at yeah there's a 
[00:49:00]  piece of it that's it the second one was the one the second one was the one the first one was all  right man the second first one was great i wanted to use the first one really because it was a lot more  of what i want to because i always like to put across that you don't have to  like have be funny every second of your yeah time on stage you know exactly so it was a lot of  good moments uh you know a lot of good audience moments and well but they they put the sec the  second one is the prevalent one and and it's only one thing they use from the first one and then it's 
[00:49:30]  the whole it's the whole second i remember we were all talking you're going look now go out there for  the second show and just have fun because you nailed it and well that's why i did a lot of cursing in  the second show because i thought i had the first yeah and now it turns out they didn't even use  most of the first that's unbelievable this fucking thing the first has some um the first has some uh  uh some behind the scenes i put i put some extras from the first the extras on the dvd are hysterical  and you lay into that fucking chick in the i'm surprised they let me put that oh is that great i 
[00:50:00]  put a boot in her stupidity and that guy she was with tweeted me that says dude she's exactly how  you represented her yeah did you have to get her to sign something everybody signed something  that was that was on camera it was so egregiously attacking her that she didn't know what she was  signing she no they well you come in they have the thing this is the tv taping but people who were 
[00:50:30]  who were kind of featured they wanted to get the sign yeah she almost didn't sign but she was  shell shocked still could have used her that whole thing yes you you are you are the property  of this thing when you come in once you walk in really i guess they just do that for extra protection  uh and it's and she could have been on it i want i actually was pushing for that part because it was  just somehow i found her face everybody was having a good time and she just had that ultra not having a  good time face right right and um so the kid goes the kid she was with goes i go you guys you know 
[00:51:00]  you guys together or you and she he goes look at look at her and i go oh okay so the crowd went  ooh he said it wrong he should have been like look at me look at me yeah yeah he was trying to say  she's so much better than him and i was like i think she got a funny shaped head i thought i thought  you meant you yeah yeah yeah that's what it comes off like and and then we explain it but then it's  like i'm just he's trying to friend zone his way into some ass uh-huh and and and then i go off but 
[00:51:30]  it's in this it's in the extras man yeah and they took care of me with the dvd i'm looking at it for  the first time really um it it's i envisioned it differently but i'm i'll take this really because  there's usually comedy cds uh uh the horseshit uh it's it's wrapped it's in that special uh it's  in a in a cardboard slide in so the actual dvd a sleeve you have to slide it out it feels then cut 
[00:52:00]  it it feels like a real dvd it's dvd-ish yeah it is it is they hooked me up you know what i still  had a different thing i wanted i wanted to move it in my face and i do a dance  you know i got the social networking dvd at home and it's the same packaging so it's it's i'm it's  the they packaged it the right way i'm very happy with uh the picture comedy central i'm very happy  with the special i'm very happy with the well fucking people that did it i'm excited i just 
[00:52:30]  hope people you know we got a chance to watch well tomorrow night at 10 o'clock on comedy central we  all got to tweet the hell out of this let's let's push this man yeah definitely you should tweet  during the the special maybe i probably won't watch it oh really i probably just kind of i'll just  sit around like you know you know you know in the fetal position just like you ever hoping i don't have  to get on a plane to albany you ever you ever when uh you're on tv you kind of pace around your  apartment and just keep looking at the clock and go okay i'm on right this second all right all right  now it's 12 35 okay it's safe to watch tv yeah it's safe to watch tv yeah and then you sit around 
[00:53:00]  but it's happened to me you kind of just walk around like knowing you're on and a lot of eyes  are watching you and you just don't want to deal with that and then it feels way better when you  know you're finally off the tv i've never had a moment where like i don't know what to i don't i  really want this thing to push push it forward but i've i've done a million things that after it's on  you just you go okay now now what now how does famous happen yeah now what happens somebody calls 
[00:53:30]  you and say you're famous shouldn't the phone start ringing right about now when does it happen  like right after when do you realize that fame's not happening like three days later when you're  walking around and nobody says i saw you last night when you're going to marshall's and no one gives a  shit will you will you walk around sunday hoping that people like just uh i need a bodyguard to go to  church it's like no are you gonna make believe you just have errands to do and but i've seen it 
[00:54:00]  happen to cat williams i've seen it yeah his special came on and kaboom i've seen it happen to ron  white it's happening to whitney cummins are those uh county central specials though  the biggest comedy central buzz i've ever heard yeah thank you that's what i was gonna ask was uh  who got pushed way forward because of a comedy central i would i would say joe coy okay i would 
[00:54:30]  say mike burbiglia special pushed him forward okay um i don't know about billy billy's kind of  like me in a sense bill i think billy has a lot a lot more followers i think but i think billy has a  uh a body of work so he's like he's in there but i don't know if billy had a pop special i'm not  sure um charlie murphy had one charlie charlie murphy's popped on dave chapelle and then he popped 
[00:55:00]  in the special but joe coy if you say somebody that went from zero to 60 you said it pushed forward  is joe coy i think and then mike burbiglia got a following all right so you're gonna be the next one  this has to work for you man look at the watch yeah i'm serious dude i'm really has to happen  for you because you and i'm never like that you had to come out of retirement uh a mere three weeks  into it i was talking to patrice the other day i was in a cab i said you know i fucking gotta catch

[00:58:30]  and uh she goes how did how did you how did piss get behind the toilet like behind the toilet  i go i don't know i just would get up sad and and uh you know i was feeling sorry for him i was  peeing on the wall i guess it's like i would pee until i heard water  that middle of the night yeah and just when i heard water i peed i just went in there it was uh  you know uh didn't change the sheets i'm telling you i fucking i houston i came out of retirement in 
[00:59:00]  houston saturday got the people got the best show but i never tried to give a bad show but  saturday i felt good i actually go okay i could do comedy again yeah but i think it was all anxiety  it was uh sadness it was a lot of feeling sorry for myself and yeah but i started going man i had to  come to the conclusion i'm depressed i was like i'm depressed obviously that i'm fucking a mess  depressed diabetic my hair i was walking down the stairs and you know i used to run downstairs like 
[00:59:30]  you know to be in fear it sucks like i'm i'm tipping toe down the stairs going oh whoopsie oh boy oh  if i fall oh oh shit it's gonna happen bad so i'm walking down the stairs like an old bitch i need  the fucking life alert bracelet because i'm i'm fucking just i'm telling you i just got depressed  man i just got horribly sad but you know where it came from it just it came from um because some 
[01:00:00]  people just comes out of nowhere and they're like ah and they gotta go through therapy to find out  where it is after my special i just didn't um i didn't i was like okay i'm done i tell you what  it is i start thinking about the past and i've done i've done a showtime special i've done uh countless  tv shows a few movies hbo which was the biggie a half hour hbo still to this day i mean no offense to 
[01:00:30]  comedy central but if you talk to any comic the cache of doing hbo that's one hour or a half hour  it just is what it is i i mean you can't yeah let's be honest you know but no offense to comedy  central but it is what it is and uh uh and i did a a comedy central special countless little five  minutes on this show and that no and i've never been able to really close out some material so it's 
[01:01:00]  always like it closes out for me but i never i started you know what it was i started uh the  depression came from i started having a talk with god like what am i gonna give me a fucking break guy  oh shit like for real like i need a break because for real i was listening to this brooke shields  interview last night i was listening to two things last night i always you know on the ipad some  some shit we was talking about the racial shit we was talking about and then brooke shields he's  just on the worst enemy i said why is this bitch saying this shit oh she don't know me right right 
[01:01:30]  we met on the motherfucking show you talked for an hour a total of an hour  yes he's destructive but that's that's why my shit's fucked up because people because brooke brooke  size me the fuck up oh shit as a my own worst enemy like and she really feels like she knows you  even though she hasn't spent a lot of time with you and this is not trashing because i like the lady  because she doesn't get to know that's the fucking phoniness of hollywood hollywood and i when i'm 
[01:02:00]  acting like an asshole i'm trying to keep me from being an ass i'm hiding but she kept pressing  right so people are sitting around like it's a goddamn indian storytelling time right when she's  this is what she's talking about the the first five days i'm on set and everybody's like oh my goodness  brooke is i'm doing the pepper lemon cleanse and people like you know oh no pepper lemon 
[01:02:30]  oh hi heart and i'm sitting in the corner going this horse shit hit my head yeah looking like a  fat ogre right but but an angry shrek not a nice shrek but you're trying to keep it together because  you know if you say anything it's not going to be good for you or your career so but she read the  energy see what she was right about was my energy of distance right right right which which ultimately  is destruction you're not going to jump in and be like so the lemon yeah it's just i it's just i'll 
[01:03:00]  end up making myself look bad but she ends up pressing and finally going i'm sure patrice is  very interested in this okay everybody's around directors i go uh yes brooke i've been interested  in your shits since suddenly susan so you couldn't so you couldn't help yourself how is that going to  help your career but that is what that turned her right then we're best friends and all the people 
[01:03:30]  are like he's an asshole can't say it no more yeah but that's hollywood that's that's why i was mad  at this whole mel gibson off of uh uh uh what's called two yeah yeah the uh the movie he was supposed  to do and they threw him off the yeah uh hangover too because i know hollywood people in hollywood  don't make their own decisions no no one no camera guy and grip girl makes a decision to stand up to  mel gibson unless someone gives them you know a power to do so right so so ultimately to go back 
[01:04:00]  to the to the original story i'm telling is like look i i just have expectations for this and i i guess  my my depression was what am i going to do after comedy what has comedy taught me that i could do  something else other than comedy if this doesn't help let's fucking it's if that's what if it this  doesn't help i'm like what can i but that's the great mystery it's not a mystery but that's what we 
[01:04:30]  talked about it's radio these fucking guys would wake up but you should be a great great radio host  i'm tired of the grind yeah because i have it's like you know what it is i'm a i'm i feel like uh  sometimes and this i'm not boohooing but listen i chose what i chose you chose what you chose people  yeah so if anybody's out there that's breaking a knuckle and they go what the fuck is he talking  it's like hey man i chose what i chose so you can be sad if you want to and i know i never feel  sorry for myself but i go i like to close out material that's it it's like you know like uh during 
[01:05:00]  during my first my comedy central special i was doing all of that uh 9 11 shit really good 9 11  shit uh and and i was doing a pepsi cola rapist at that time right yeah which was one of my  biggies so i was like damn i would have loved to just each level get to ride a wave of popularity  based on some shit that that i did but i never got to do that so i'm thinking if this in in in in 
[01:05:30]  proper form if this just goes yay it's out and you know whatever i go i go i can't take  getting on a plane again oh my feet swelling up starting to think about i'm in a fucking hotel  and then you go out and you your audience isn't there because right now i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm very  viable in about seven cities and i get the same people so it's pressure another thing that's pressure  on me is that i put myself in a position to have to always have some new shit yeah a little bit of 
[01:06:00]  same people showing up right and i'm not like you know i do audience work and and all that  shit yeah so i have to have some energy man so it's like about seven cities they really take care  of me but then you go to a place and it's you know i said albany nothing against albany but  i went there and it was five people in the audience so you don't think what the fuck but  you don't think let's say you know you you pop to the next level you don't think there's a grind  there that is exactly the same as this one only different welcome to the layer cake son yeah 
[01:06:30]  exactly not the rarefied atmosphere but i would take just to take a little less  shit yeah but a little less shit if the grind means uh performing in front of a lot more people then  then it makes it a little more bearable it makes it better because look if you walk into  if you're walking into arenas like dane cook has been doing the last few years it makes it a little  easier you don't think he sits there and goes like mother oh i'm sure no matter what you do  there's a grind to it but the false and you're getting off a fucking private plane and you're 
[01:07:00]  getting in a car and jumping right to the arena and there's 15 000 people it makes it a little easier  than some of these clubs that you think you're doing well in and there's no one there like you  said about albany and i i mean i'm not an avarice guy though i'm not like some guy that's chasing  glory i just want to be able to walk anywhere and because i just want a little push forward i thought i'm  thinking to myself here's what it is it's like how can anybody not know me who follows comedy  uh-huh but i i looked at the thing where norton was getting got to jesse ventura when he was when 
[01:07:30]  he was blasting jesse ventura yeah 900 000 people saw that video 800 000 was like who's this little  asshole talking to jesse they still think it's it's either me or it they don't know they didn't know  norton i'm sitting there going there's 800 000 motherfuckers going fuck this little piece of  shit who is he i'm glad you brought that up because that amazes me too with everything that  jimmy's done with his career and that video they hate jimmy oh you know the the conspiracy guys  and the and the jesse fans but they think it's me they think it's anthony 
[01:08:00]  they and then some will go who is this uh little bald fuck it's brutal actually there's 800 000 people  at one pop yeah that doesn't know yeah it's jim norton yeah that follows comedy yeah it's pretty  amazing so that's all the shit you think of but if this special is good you're you're gonna be  cursed because then it's gonna force you to get back on the road yeah but people are gonna want  to like see the guy from the special now well here's what i'm hoping it does just brings those 
[01:08:30]  people out bring just brings a little more my people though like but i think i'm realizing you know  my people don't don't uh pay uh my people have kids and they can't afford babysitters and ten dollar  drinks my my people and and the biggest comics in the world all have a people like if you look at  any comic who's a who's a big time seller yeah except for like seinfeld because he's seinfeld  right uh he doesn't just have all jews come to see him no no but i'm sure a lot of jews come to see 
[01:09:00]  him but uh larry the cable guy 60 000 rednecks rednecks ron white 60 000 older rednecks uh little  cab all black people uh uh uh joe koi all koreans who want to laugh and and russell peters all asians  like all asians indian you know everybody goes to see russell p the biggest comic and dane cook had all 
[01:09:30]  uh college young white kids so i'm like well who the fuck am i going for  fucking who's my who's the people that's going to go this patrice is the guy and and this girl  at comic central goes i think men i go yeah but you'll never let that happen you'll never let men  galvanize to be an audience but i'm not just for men i'm for men with their women right you know so  couples i'm a couples guy i don't think that even you're not what does that do you're not gonna get 
[01:10:00]  the couples i mean we first dates i was at the taping and and saw it you know we gotta slow down  a little bit i mean the women enjoyed it but that's gonna be a tough sell long term so you're i think  you're i think you're sort of cursed because you're you're you have uh the ona crowd which is a great  comedy crowd a great comedy crowd but then you also have the black crowd which is a great  you have a really diverse audience so it's a little it's a little and black people just finding out 
[01:10:30]  about me by the way in the last four years yeah what the fuck is that about what is that i i because  it's like you know i'm i'm i'm fair so yeah you know people like to be it's like you know little kev  is funny kev is funny but it's it's so definitively uh black but not not black and cat  you know kevin is filling a void right but you get the black cat was i mean niggas man yeah i mean 
[01:11:00]  i have to say i mean cat was now chris rock has a very interesting audience man chris rock has  everybody yeah yeah and a lot of black people but see chris rock uh snuck into black later too he wasn't  he was a mixed guy oh yeah well then he got black he got black in 98 when he said nick i ain't afraid  of black people i'm afraid of niggas just when he did that that pushed him he fucking that was it  hey what kind of black people you got um chris rocky i got i got fair black people man but you 
[01:11:30]  don't got some of those if i say obamas you know go ahead sorry that's all i got go ahead you hit  your arm motherfucker i'm sorry go ahead no that's fine i'll be forgetting no i was just black  audiences and and and chris rock sort of has kind of the the i can't i can't describe it like a safer  black audience how would you know he has retired gangsters yeah he has he has black people that um 
[01:12:00]  i think look i had to get like i didn't know there were levels of black audiences yeah i mean look when  i first came to new york i would i would go to brooklyn and queens and just get yelled at because i would  i would be you weren't black enough yeah but i was black enough i wasn't black enough for  it's drones though they get used to it they just want to hear yeah white black man crazy you know  that shit but but and and i'll say white people crazy but i'll say it like let's talk about for 
[01:12:30]  real white people crazy yeah but it's like white people phones work and black people you know white  people when they move and it's funny look i want what black people when they move like here's a  classic that you've heard i've heard six motherfuckers say um black people uh when when white people move  they move in the daytime with a truck and or no when they go on vacation okay white people go on vacation 
[01:13:00]  and go goodbye everybody i'm going on vacation but here's the key to my house and uh feed my fish  or whatever billy what's up hey bill guys bill burr what's up bro how are you there he is and this  is the expert on nigger rooms right here bill got more nigger room experience than i do like straight  gangster room like that yeah so but but it'll go it'll go be like oh um i'm i'm i um  uh black when black people move out we got to move if we know when we vacation when we got a 
[01:13:30]  vacation we got to make it we gotta leave at 12 midnight the motherfucker don't see us leaving  which is it's fine but it's a rhythm it's a way to be it's and black people another thing white people  do that's interesting is they they have their favorite jokes too right like you didn't do the one  about the white people if they see you last week and you say the same shit last week that you said 
[01:14:00]  this week nigga yeah what the fuck you lazy bastard motherfucker write something new say some new  shit nigga really like the idea of art and bombing and it's just not there but there was a few guys  that were experts at it i'm gonna tell you who's great the greatest black room comic i've ever seen too  mike epps and fucking tracy morgan yeah the two greatest black room performers in the history of 
[01:14:30]  the planet that i've ever seen live wow amazing but i'm getting them now because i did def jam i did a  little this they get they're coming now and it's a very specific but i just don't like people yelling at  at me how hilarious is that coming out of his mouth yeah i don't like just i like people waiting  their turn to talk yeah like i don't want to i don't want to fucking like not why i'm working  some shit out like you just sit there white people will sit there and uh take it and check it out yeah 
[01:15:00]  listen we got to cut this short because we got an extremely busy day but uh we want to make sure  people watch uh patrice's uh special tomorrow 10 o'clock at comedy central it's going to be  awesome i want to plug this tomorrow yeah no we're gonna plug it all morning don't worry uh bill bird  joining the program i want to plug this strange plastic in the middle my hit my shit's not hard  enough to open i don't like it yeah it should be really hard it's pretty hard to open  we got to need something besides your fingers you need keys i need a razor blade yeah this is what is 
[01:15:30]  this is cheap plastic they use this is recycled oh and patrice is on fallon tonight very cool  patrice o'neill will be on there now we got to take a break because uh triple h is gonna be here  in like 15 minutes then we got william h macy and bill burr just arrived so we want to uh reset  a little this is february motherfucker you niggas don't care about shit all right we care  we're overbooked today for some reason we got way too many people coming out a lot of white guys  here so but uh comedy central tomorrow night 10 o'clock two bills what's the name of the special 
[01:16:00]  patrice it's elephant in the room and not because of my weight no no that's it i wanted to call it  800-pound gorilla but i didn't think anybody would be able to separate  hey we're on we're on bill barrett studio show continues during the break  uh i don't even know where to go uh first of all patrice i i almost brought bill burr to a hockey 
[01:16:30]  game but it didn't work out because his bruins were playing my islanders last night so i gave him  the heads up i was hoping to bring him uh to that horrible arena the the fucking coliseum i like that  place so we were talking about uh hockey a little bit and then patrice had to pipe in and just say  hockey sucks yeah he's just not a fan of hockey at all i i i one thing i do i have a small bit of  knowledge about something to say something and i'm scared to even bring it up because you're the 
[01:17:00]  type of guy that probably would be able to convince me that hockey sucks you're that strong with your  opinion it's not a popular game we're not gonna leave here and go you know what why it's not a  popular game it's just not a popular it's kind of popular no one no it isn't no it isn't it isn't  popular you go up into canada and it's it's like the fucking second coming in christ but nobody knows  it's on money up there what's going on cracks me up you go to canada you turn around some of their bills  and there's like a hockey game going on it's the same soccer argument money no we know no no we know 
[01:17:30]  everybody on the planet earth loves soccer right right not america no that's it it is what it is i  mean why argue hockey needs to do a couple things if you want to get into it let's make hockey popular  let's figure i can do it right now hockey needs no they need to accept the fact that they were a rogue  sport they for the last for the last 30 years you're not all they've done is try to appease  people who aren't going to continue to not watch hockey no true hockey fan ever had a problem with 
[01:18:00]  the fights never had a problem with the barbaric let never had a problem that there was that's it  i love people they go there's two half times like mathematically that even makes sense it's just like  you're fucking retards it you don't get the game you've never been to a game live it's the worst game  to watch on tv you have to watch like five feet to the left of your tv screen to figure out what  isn't even being televised that there's a line change you're like why did he just dump the puck  and just stop it's because believe it or not skating at full speed for 90 seconds you get a little 
[01:18:30]  windy yeah you're exhausted you need some other guy like people just they don't get it why did they  let him fight amazing i will say what bill is saying they dumped the puck so they can  can fucking change uh the players out yeah you just nailed it it's like somebody who never boxed  before and go this guy's a pussy let's like dude just stand and throw punches at air for 20 seconds  you'll be fucking huffing and puffing yeah just to go with your point too they've been trying to make  it you know family friendly too stop when i was with the mascots and those ice whores skating out to 
[01:19:00]  clear off the ice well terrific yeah but don't they could have those outfits a little  fucking skimp here trust me but when i was growing up when i was fucking when i was growing  up though i was a little kid enjoying the fighting it didn't bother me so why all of a sudden we have  to like you know but that's everything though you gotta be fair no we don't have to be fair because  why are they letting everything be like this though why is why is rated r so fucking horrible nowadays  but just focusing on his point if if they accept they're a rogue sport you're going to keep the 
[01:19:30]  people you got there's people that are leaving the sport because they're like this is not what i want  in my hockey so they changed what did they change they're not bringing in enough people and and some  of the older old school guys are leaving because they're like this is what they did other than  fighting what's different this is what they did this is what they did you can't touch the goalie  when he fucking leaves the crease that used to be scary as shit for these goalies this is what killed  them it was the combination of those canadian teams coming down south and then they added like 
[01:20:00]  five teams down south like in tampa florida nashville phoenix and then you had regular  teams that you knew what they look like they all changed their uniforms drastically like the sabers  went from like blue and gold to black and red and white and it looked like you were watching the ihl  that that whole era it was terrible and then you also had the left wing lock the clutch and grab you  there was a 10-year brutal fucking period not to mention the nhl always makes brilliant moves like 
[01:20:30]  well we have a deal with espn but the usa network offered us more money let's let's go to that one  versus versus here in new york yeah they do i don't even know where versus is and i like hockey  hockey gets the same coverage as high school women's golf no it's it's and i can't even argue  with it and they have other things like nba is one of the greatest games ever hyped and the last three  minutes takes like 58 minutes to timeout timeout foul foul timeout tv timeout and like that whole 
[01:21:00]  game ends with people like on taking unguarded shots like i'm watching the lakers celtics championship  last year where i watched the lakers win a championship from the fucking foul line where  one one they call like 38 fouls to 17 on the other because the ref doesn't like rashid and has like  these personal grudges like the nba is fucking i think the nba is hinged on right there i think the  nba is absolutely filthy it's it's fixed it's like it's he's not he's not they had a ref with 
[01:21:30]  mob ties he's not busted and like don't you think if you were on that officiating crew you'd notice  like gee mark's calling it kind of close tonight gee he's really letting them play like like you  wouldn't be able to pick up on it don't look at me i'm not gonna jump in i'd fucking make me sick  the nba loves uh big market teams being in the finals and it seems to happen every year i don't  think they should have anything where there's eight foot niggas controlled by four feet white  guys it can't be fair and that's how i feel about it not since 1865 i can't it's at least 
[01:22:00]  somebody who's not into me because rashid wallace we said rashid wallace's mother said  my baby is six foot eleven and he's mean and but he's not a horrible person these guys don't know how  to deal with him they don't they they're scared of him and i understand that which uh what's his  name with the bowling ball shoulders the white howard yeah he got a great smile but physically  this is king kong man and it's it's a scary guy but here's the reason i'm not into basketball anymore 
[01:22:30]  i was a basketball you're a big basketball guy i'm a basketball in my blood but i'm not it's not like it  used to be i loved basketball but what happened is is guys coming out of high school ruined it for me  because i used to follow guys coming from high school then they play four years of college a little  college then they it's like a story right and uh and i i just stopped caring at like now it's a  freshman you get a great freshman he comes into college and he well the neck tattoos the neck tattoos 
[01:23:00]  did it for me neck tattoos that that kind of turned me because we thought about it one day and i'm like  when did i stop following basketball and i said you know what i think when they introduced the neck  tattoo for some reason i just couldn't relate to these guys at all i also don't like when you  dunk a ball and then you stand at baseline going and thumping your fucking chest like you just ripped  down a building it's just so fucking like the worst one ever was paul gasol when he was a complete  pussy in 2007 they they actually drew a cartoon of him as the tin man like he had no heart was 
[01:23:30]  fucking hilarious and then like the next year in like december he decides to show up after choking in  the finals he dunks a couple of times right and then he starts thumping his chest it's like dude  it's a game in december yeah let's let's relax i can't it's not may yet wow all all of that that's  another reason why i like hockey is if you do something like that someone will beat the  shit out of you and uh and all they have to do is sit down for five minutes it's like i i find hockey  there's a justice to it right where the where the the cunts get what's coming to them and they all come up 
[01:24:00]  they all understand each other like the refs know these guys got a fight and they make sure it's a  fair fight unless it's the the penguins and the islanders like last week or a guy like matt cook  matt cook is the dirtiest player in the league and mario lemieux is just yippin yippin yippin  he always bitched when he played it keeps up like this i'm gonna retire well that's what he said  recently i'm gonna take my stick and go home someone in the paper today said that does even play his own  fucking video game where you could blow off the hockey part of the mario lemieux hockey game and go right to the 
[01:24:30]  fighting oh really oh yeah brilliant you get more and you get more points if you punch the guy in  the head in the video game and he's crying about it give me the paper and the penguins have had some  of the most filthiest people in history this is the brilliance of that franchise i was saying this  during the break is not only can they spot the crosby before anybody else but they signed the  alf samuelson matt cook i'm gonna blow out your fucking leg so they don't have to worry about their  stars going down sure do that matt cook dude is filthy he's dirty listen uh filthy so 
[01:25:00]  mario bitched about the islanders and penguins game if you're a sports fan you understand that  okay so phil mushnik who i'm not really a fan of but but he's such a ray of sunshine yeah he certainly  is the guy the guy hates sports we say this every time so why is he writing about it why don't you go  find another fucking thing to write about he goes funny thing though one day the kids in the  neighborhood dumped the mario brothers uh video games uh for uh mario lemieux hockey just one look they  love that video gate uh video game not that they all were hockey fans okay as a sideshow mario lemieux 
[01:25:30]  hockey had a fighting mode the kids could skip the hockey click straight to the fighting mode  the mario lemieux video game even scored the fights uh knockout punches to players heads worth the most  with uh with the head worth uh the most figures yeah so there you go a good old phil mushnik  as long as he took a few bucks for uh his name on that game yes didn't the strike do something bad  to hockey yeah that was awful every sport yeah when you cancel an entire season and people aren't  watching already that that kind of that kind of affects it but i didn't but tonight tampa versus 
[01:26:00]  nashville when they were when they were striking though that it was so big it hit my ear meaning  the news of it right like i didn't pay attention to hockey but i knew it wasn't a bat i knew it more  it got more put it this way wasn't on i fucking knew more names than ovechkin and and crosby or  what sydney crowd i hockey was in the conversation yeah and then that fucking strike happened well and  i've never heard of hockey again so i want to say in the ratings have gone up every year since the 
[01:26:30]  lockout for the nhl i'm not sure if that's no i think i think the hockey is that true hockey is  actually great right now but uh there were certain things like i don't like that they got rid of the  red line i thought they should really i love that they should have just called it an illegal defense  with the left wing lock you can't bring that forward up he has to stay up in four check then you'd have  those great rushes again you'd have the three-on-twos the two-on-ones and then they just  decided to get rid of it and it's uh now trying to watch it on tv you get like whiplash i felt like  it just opened up the whole fucking game though man these guys got way too quick and way too big to 
[01:27:00]  deal with that red line shit maybe you're right maybe i don't know i have no idea i love that they  changed that rule but whatever i know what does it matter it's like you just hate hockey i don't hate  hockey no no just did you see the winter classic that when they played outside yeah that's kind of  cool exactly they played on the moon 24 7 on hbo i heard it i heard it was phenomenal the 24 7 hbo 
[01:27:30]  was great man i'm sorry to see these guys no reason to apologize that's all right i'm just saying sorry  because i like to be open to things i like to be open to things that people love a lot and i go all right  let me i got i tried to watch i used to like i told you i used to sell penis and popcorn at the  at the garden and i would go please somebody tell me about hockey and i learned there's off sides  there's certain things and i think a lot of not liking a game is you don't know the rules yeah yeah  that's true and and you know some of the rules of why this guy is shooting by himself against the 
[01:28:00]  goalie or why there's no goalie like if you don't know you go the goalie's missing  you know what kills me is every four years when the olympics come around i pray that al michaels  doesn't have to explain the entire game and he always does always that's off sides when a player  without that is called icing sometimes it is waved off you're just going like is it ever going to 
[01:28:30]  catch on the javelin is so explanatory imagine if every game they had to explain baseball oh oh god  instead of a ball they use a puck explain baseball to me that's another sport i don't give a  shit the baseball class hey they playing baseball in fucking spain i don't it's just a boring game not  a fan of baseball as much as i used to be it's just bores me to tears and i know it's slow for 
[01:29:00]  me i know you gotta be talented you know what you know what baseball is good for it's better in this  these days than it was in the old days when you just had like i remember going over my grandparents  house my grandfather would be sitting there watching the mets with that big clicker that  used to go like yeah two buttons on it on off and volume and uh he'd be sitting there watching  the game and and it was boring as fuck i'd be looking going what the fuck he's just waiting to die over  there uh now though there's so many other things to do while you're watching tv that it's cool you 
[01:29:30]  could fucking play online poker you're fucking like cruising do you realize this is a this is a  commercial for why baseball sucks exactly i thought you were gonna go right no no you're right but the  thing is it could be on in the background while you're doing other shit and then you can look up  and go oh look a triple why where's baseball getting all this money if it's where's baseball  getting all this it's a huge sport to go out to that's our hockey going to the fucking games it's 
[01:30:00]  nice weather it's outside you're like fucking ah just going to a ball game which by the way unless  you got really good seats sucks ass you don't see the replays you don't fucking see shit but they  they took that out of the game because now these parks it's it's like an amusement park you know  i know the stadiums now hang out in your seats for two innings let's check this place out let's  go to water slide i'm gonna go to the macy's down at the end of the fucking uh by the memorial park  the new yankee stadium is the funniest one ever where they have that guy behind glass carving up 
[01:30:30]  steaks right yes i think most people can't afford right yeah what about yankee stadium  what about yankee it's a baseball game your feet are supposed to be sticking to the floor  as you're walking around i went to yankee stadium finally and uh around the fourth inning because i'm  not a yankee fan i'm like i want to check this place out and my buddy goes let's go to the museum  i'm like they have a fucking it's the museum yeah so we're like yeah that we will get right in it's  the fifth inning right we go there there's an hour wait for the museum like how is there an hour 
[01:31:00]  wait for the game during a fucking game game that's how baseball is well you know when you watch the uh  the yankees games and you don't see anybody sitting around home plate aside from the fact i know that  that it's really expensive when you get those seats you you can walk in you can eat the whole game for  free like it what not for free comes with the price of the tickets yeah so just pick a guy just see a  guy sitting there a couple innings will go by and all of a sudden the guy isn't there and you watch he  won't be there for like three innings he's just stuffing his face with prime rib and all this  shit and then he finally comes back and it looks so bad because this is this is like the 
[01:31:30]  the the biggest franchise in sports and it always looks like they have like 18 people at the park  yeah because that's the only part of the park they show dude i had those seats one time somebody  gave me a hookup and i i chowed i chowed and i gave the finger to somebody at home when they  called me on my cell phone i wasn't even watching the game dude it was ridiculous and you got to get  your money's worth oh yeah you feel like you got to eat your money's worth but this is why football is uh  football's king it's just king i'm not even gonna argue with that it's once a week if that it's 
[01:32:00]  every game counts every game counts every game counts it's fucking you know it could be a career  ender for anyone at any moment four games like no every game twelve and four eleven and five is  possible you you can miss the playoffs yeah but if you're two games back right right your two games  back is like being like nine games down in baseball right right right right the only problem is 179  000 games and they i love that they're playing two games in one day baseball it's like oh that's why 
[01:32:30]  and that's why it's funny that people actually gamble on on sports where where they have the dog days  of summer or like nba hoop you can tell when somebody has like some pussy in town they just drag an ass  or they're thinking about it and you're just like like you can't bet like buddy of mine was betting  the other night he's going he's like all the heat are playing the paces man he goes i'm telling you  this is a gift and i go i don't know man indiana it's a boring town you have no they might just they  might just say fuck it and this is game number 78 yeah yeah there's no motivation when it's game 78 
[01:33:00]  but you can't lack in football because somebody will paralyze you i'm gonna fucking kill you but  the other side of football my jets you know we had a big time run and i don't want to start over  next year you know what's funny because every game had such promises by the way huh he's doing  the i promise you like enough of you when your team when your team almost makes it and you don't  you don't make the super bowl you're like you get this feeling of i don't want to start all over 
[01:33:30]  where every game did you hear what he said he said this is what he said after a year of talking  shit and never owning up to it yeah he goes he goes he goes uh last year they just talked to him  like a week ago he goes last year i thought we were going to win a super bowl this year i know  it it's like what are you going to say after next year this year i really really know it  it's like he's one of those guys who just calls it you know that guy that guy likes to be the like  dude i called it they call it every night dude i'm telling you blow out i'm telling you blow out 
[01:34:00]  and then one day it finally happens what i say i told you what i say see i've been saying it  they're fucked there's a salary cap this year they're done yeah football yeah he's  only thing i don't like is goodale i just i'm not a fan of his there's something  elitist about him he bugs me and he's um and this fake uh confidence players don't want to be hurt  thing like like it's just stop playing it's something else going on yeah stop your horse  shit just let them like guys like james harrison just let them die let them let them be warriors and 
[01:34:30]  that's the only thing but football is so fucking perfect man what perfect game what about your celtics  though man what about them they used to be a big celtics fan the black celtics i love the celtics  i'm happy that they're relevant let's all start uh calling them the black celtics and everything  yeah because they are and i know boston i know the pain and suffering of these white people watching  these niggas running around winning that i i fucking enjoy it with their shamrocks on their back and  and they're a little fucking all these people from the movies the town 
[01:35:00]  fucking sickening me i like the town i like the  i mean you know what's funny they look at them the same way they always did it's not like they  they didn't notice in like the 80s when it was a bunch of white people they were still probably  that fucking dennis johnson dude johnson freckle face just give it to larry i don't think it was  as bad when larry was the face like if luke herringode became the face it would be luke and the 
[01:35:30]  fucking bob x back there like frankie valley frankie valley in the ink spots  and because i know boston it's painful yeah but they love winning but it's painful but i'm telling  you that's why the patriots is so beloved i love the patriots i can't that's the one thing i can't  get out of my system in terms of boston yeah is the sports and the food two things sports and the food  i love boston food and boston sports uh what's boston known for food wise nothing but we're the 
[01:36:00]  it's the best food it's the best food of anything i put boston anything up against anything for  three years i can't think what they eat traditionally you know you got philly philly's the cheesesteaks  oh yeah the chowder but boston boston doesn't want anything kid get a fucking scorpion bowl with  the chicken fingers boston chinese food bill and bob's roast beef cambridge it really is they don't  fuck around yeah it's tremendous but but you know the black sultans i love them i'm just saying that the 
[01:36:30]  season is is is pathetic yeah it's just it's just what did russell win like uh 10 or 11  11 11 and they still hate him what is this gonna have to do i mean i think that all those people  died off the people that shot at him when he was going he was winning championships and they still  shot at his house back when he was winning the championship they really didn't have an open  mind man good call bill two words for you bob cozy you wouldn't be able to score now if you didn't 
[01:37:00]  fucking if he didn't pass it to you how bad you think you want to be traded but they didn't trade uh  many players back then you you pretty much played for one team when russell was playing  well his story not a lot of trading no before free agency was ridiculous it was ridiculous in  baseball baseball basically if you were in the yankees organization and they and you were a  shortstop and they had derek jeter you were right you couldn't leave you just you just played your  career in the minors yeah god even though you knew you were you're good enough to play on any  and contracts after you remember all that shit you're gonna have to get out of that you felt 
[01:37:30]  like you knew the players because year after year after fucking year yeah same faces bill  russell still he's just an ornery old coop now we got triple h coming into the late very busy day  hold on uh bill what are you promoting because it's gonna get really i'm in uh uh  count basie theater red bank new jersey tonight yes tonight all right and patrice has got the  big commie central special tomorrow night at 10 and now we got triple h in studio  how you doing look at you all sharp you don't age brother i know right a few years go by we see

[01:39:00]  i was like i don't know you like i want to say you were great in blade three but like that's  that's what we wanted but i was i was on the back it was i was the most fun you know people in this 
[01:39:30]  world it was fun it was like you were on the plane because at the at that time um all the um  you know the the coco bewares and the uh brooklyn brawler brooklyn brawler they'll be they have to  take a cab to the next day uh it was it was uh it was triple h yeah and he was triple h at the time  too he wasn't uh uh he wasn't hunter hers he was triple h at the time it was uh uh the undertaker was on 
[01:40:00]  the plane and it was one more biggie on the plane at the time and uh and and and then the  family so i sat in the back and one of the guys who had been there for a couple of years was trying  to get me to be like the butler but one of the other writers and i go i don't really i don't give a  fuck like and that's why i had to leave because it was like you had to you have to be very company  like like yeah of course stephanie fired me she fired me four times in one you know you're fired 
[01:40:30]  back no i just i just said okay i said i said i understand and she said you're fired man  i said stephanie i i know you gotta fire me i i love you and you're fine she said you're  five four times four times and i said i understand i fucking why are you being hostile  i understand we miss stephanie uh triple h she used to do our show all the time yeah i'll tell  you what she misses being around it too she actually was so we said hi we wish she could 
[01:41:00]  have come in today she she said to say hi to you guys yeah well the uh her introduction into the uh  public forum of uh wwf at the time uh was just amazing it was probably the most fun time uh of  wrestling that was like the golden age when we were watching you know obviously you still got  plenty of people watching but that time when she was in that boiler room locked up to the the pipes  and she and just trying to make it look like she's upset and crying it was classic was the whole test 
[01:41:30]  thing back in the day that test push the marriage thing and the the number the kidnapping in vegas and  all that was you were you and your wife was y'all together no i didn't even know her you know and  honestly i wasn't even involved in that storyline but uh we had a writer at the time this guy vince  russo vince was great at coming up with stuff and having no way to get out of it so he had come up 
[01:42:00]  he had come up with this concept that um to bring vince's daughter in and uh have her get involved in a  relationship with one of the guys to do a marriage because everybody loves marriage you know weddings  on tv which is rationale behind this so he puts her in this relationship story with this guy test  and uh comes time for the wedding the first time and he vince is like so what are we doing with  this yeah where are we going i don't know you know so they they literally this is how ridiculous  our world is sometimes they ridiculous they they came up with a storyline where somebody threw a 
[01:42:30]  garbage can or something hit step in the head she got amnesia and didn't know who test was  to buy us a few weeks so we could figure out what we were doing that is brilliant right and uh so um  now they've got they've got this situation where she eventually she's still got it she got to know who  this guy is the whole thing and so they don't know what they want to do and vince russo leaves the 
[01:43:00]  company oh and like the middle of the night he just takes off and goes to work for the wcw at the  time it was a competition and uh i remember vince being like well holy christ we're stuck in this  storyline this thing now with the guy with no clue how to get out of it and now he leaves and so uh  he probably knew he was leaving he's like you know how bad i thought he might have been wanting to  leave before he had to tell vince i don't have a solution so uh but then he uh i was in a storyline 
[01:43:30]  with vince at the time and just one day and sitting thinking about it was like god we should  do something that would be a perfect role what would i do to get to him right marry his daughter  you know in real life too and uh and so that's how the story got switched to me you know they really  had no intentions of her ever doing a wedding on tv that it was going to get screwed up but right  it was a really convoluted story and then our stuff ended up being huge you know so things 
[01:44:00]  do things do they still run like that kind of where you sometimes have a storyline where it's  like we have no clue well not really usually we try to have a generalized idea but a lot of times  like even when we did the steph wedding thing with me right so i pitched to vince this idea about uh  you know i'll take her to drive through to vegas and you know mickey or drink or something she doesn't  know and i get married to her the whole thing was just for me to get this roofie yeah exactly  it did though yeah she was knocked out in the back of the car i remember that point 
[01:44:30]  which you can't do anymore it's the one hand with the ring and yeah and you can't do that on tv  anymore unfortunately yeah only in the movies now yeah right 9 11 no more roofies so you know we uh  we just went down that road with the story but like it was just meant to be to get me into a  situation in a match with vince where i would get a title shot and the wedding would be a no that  was it that was our thing it was like a quick thing and man when she went out on tv that next 
[01:45:00]  night and they were chanting slut oh my god like the crowd turned on her so heavily and and we were  like i remember sitting next to vince in gorilla position i didn't even know steph  and uh she walked out and they should have reacted we both looked at each other like oh my god this is  awesome we gotta run with this so the pop a pop a pop is a pop right like no matter whether it's a  heel pop it's like has there ever been any reaction where it hurt your feelings like damn man i didn't 
[01:45:30]  want to be an asshole i was trying to be nice i'm an asshole you know i don't know i to me in our  business it's just a reaction's a reaction you know and i made majority of my name and money in the  business getting booed out of the arena but now it's this weird thing where he's you're you can't  be a heel no it's impossible towards the end when i was still a heel um you know i was working with  cena and i was supposed to be the bad guy and he was supposed to be the good guy and i was getting  you know at least half the arena cheering for me yeah and that was before they were really fully 
[01:46:00]  booing him so you know what's the most ridiculous storyline like when you were coming up that one  wasn't good enough huh i'm just saying if there was i've just figured that that was at like the  most professional level i'm just saying you just break into wrestling i mean there's got to be like  like stand-up comedy like open mic wrestling kind of most ridiculous angle ever is one that i was  involved in unfortunately and and it still gets talked about to this day it's called the katie vick  incident and it was this ludicrous story vince got in his head that he wanted characters to be more 
[01:46:30]  sympathetic and we you know we have kane right who's like the this monster yeah he decided that  in kane's backstory kane would have had have killed a girl by accident of course well it ain't gonna happen  so kane is like vince creates this this ridiculous story and this will get much better where kane has  to go on tv and full monster regalia and tell the world that like i was young i was i didn't know how 
[01:47:00]  to drive a stick very well the roads were slippery and uh you know the car got out of my control and  and she died it wasn't my fault unfortunately i'm in the storyline with him i was champion at the time  and we were wrestling over the title and i'm in the storyline with him so now vince gets obsessed with us  bringing up this dead girl to kane to the point where  you're about to go you're about to really love it to the point where he comes up with an idea where 
[01:47:30]  i am supposed to dress up like kane and go to a funeral home and have sex with a corpse in a casket  so all the whole way there now the whole way i'm like this is the dumbest thing i've ever heard but  so the whole way there i'm trying to like convince him vince we really got to make this funny like  this has to be very funny like i'm i'm really making a joke out of this no no no it needs to be 
[01:48:00]  dark and it needs to so like we already got that with the necrophilia yeah i want to try to lighten  it up now so i'm not even married at the time to the staff or anything like that i am we literally go  to a funeral home where we rent out one of the rooms we have a casket with a dummy in it i'm i'm  i'm in kane's mask and stuff and uh and any you know have the guy that is eventually going to be my 
[01:48:30]  father-in-law yelling at me to have sex louder with the dummy in the coffin and while we're doing  this i'm in i'm in a skin-colored thong on top of a dummy in a coffin in a funeral home and the guy  from the funeral home the like the mortician guy opens up the door sticks his head in and he's like  could you guys keep it down i got a funeral oh that's a ridiculous storyline my friend yeah 
[01:49:00]  it's awesome but vince don't from the two or three days i was there you just i had enough to see it  it was amazing it's really like he doesn't pitch like i don't know the hierarchy of of the guys that  like really get a lot of stick time and they get the stars they could say vince i ain't doing that  shit i don't know but i know that i know i saw one guy uh tiger ily sing he had a turban and he begged  he was begging vince he said his whole family felt he was desecrating he didn't want to wear the 
[01:49:30]  turban he didn't want to wear the turban and he's like please you know you get out  there with that turban it wasn't like it wasn't like tiger was in his face tiger would ask somebody  who would ask and i was just because the writers have complete access to everything so i'm just  looking and he just goes nope he's gonna wear the turban and this guy is like my family hates my  guts my religion and i just go i'll be like now put the bone through your nose i told you 
[01:50:00]  i told you on the show though that he's the three there's only been three people in my life that i  ever met that i you're my dudes and anybody that where i was my heart was beating he's and i looked  at him like holy shit powerful and he was one vince who's the other guy  it was uh it was jordan it's too bad jordan uh bird and then vince you met bird well i used to work 
[01:50:30]  at boston garden but he never talked and all three of them never talked you just you just right yeah  you just felt that shit like that vince does have an ominous presence but he listen he was this thing  that was amazing he was the best listener i've ever seen in my life he never as you in his writing  things he never made you would suggest something that probably was ridiculous when you think about  it but he would never say that was stupid he would he would always sit there and he greenlit  he greenlit the coffin yeah i was gonna say yeah this is a big believer and there's no dumb ideas  like or he'll take a stupid idea and turn it into a good idea i mean he's really big on that and let 
[01:51:00]  let me just say that if they're that i know that kid and if he was saying he didn't want to go out  in the turban because he was desecrating his family and all that stuff he was so full of crap on every  level that i guarantee you vince was like he's full of crap he's trying to get something else  out of it but i didn't tell the story i didn't tell the story like based on like based on like uh  vince was a fucked up guy it was based on just the the boss right thing you know what i'm saying  truly the boss it's just i always say it like this to me he's the general where everybody else that 
[01:51:30]  works for him where they're like the army and the lieutenants and all that stuff he's a general  and eventually he goes charge up that hill and die and you go all right and you do it  we're talking to recently we're trying to figure out what vince does for uh fun because he works all  the fucking time what is he doing he's just not doing the wrestling thing that he like something  he likes doing he works out that's it yeah i mean he he literally you know he's 65 years old  he will work like he'll get to the office mid-morning sometime he will work sometimes until nine or ten at 
[01:52:00]  night and then he'll go downstairs and he'll train and he'll train for a couple hours and  then he'll either finish his emails or he'll go home he sleeps a few hours he's one of those people  that just doesn't sleep a lot he'll you know for weeks on end he'll just get three four hours of  sleep or whatever and then he'll crash for a day and then he's back on track he's his work ethic is  unbelievable like just as an example this week we came home from uh we were in uh san diego on tuesday 
[01:52:30]  and we came home now sleeping on the plane is not an option so like we flew home after the show we  got home at like seven in the morning he's back at the office at 10 o'clock now back at the office  but sam weren't you saying something about vince was he was he out or oh uh yeah yeah yeah sam  what happened what is that sam got weird i just want to know where are you going no he was uh he's  back now because he was on tv but for a while after the nexus right took him out i'm sure he 
[01:53:00]  was hospitalized or something you know right right even triple h is in paris yeah he was in a coma  that's when he must have been when he was crashing yeah he was wrestling okay i know it's been here  since a while since i've been here and stuff like that but last time i was here he was making out with  homeless dudes and stuff like that yeah yeah something happened to him since then yeah he seems  to have gotten dumbed down a little bit yeah he really has what do you mean i don't know you you 
[01:53:30]  really have dumbed down a bit we haven't even mentioned uh the chaperone i see him every now and  he's like a lurker every now and every now and then he's an appearance yeah yeah yeah he's at every  appearance uh uh triple h the chaperone yeah what's the movie about it's uh it's right up your alley it's a  family movie family yeah it's a you guys ever watch that show modern family sure ariel winter  plays the daughter in that show she plays my daughter in this movie and uh i play a guy that 
[01:54:00]  went to prison gets out he's kind of lost contact with his wife and his kids and wants to get him  back but you know things don't work out so well the daughter wants nothing to do with him and he  almost goes back to crime and at the last second he changes his mind ends up as a chaperone on his  daughter's field trip and uh the money from the bank robbery that he was about to be a part of  ends up on the bus and the bad guys are chasing them in in new orleans because they think it was a  setup so he's so it's nice guy yeah you're a nice guy a nice it's a nice wholesome movie no it's it's  it's a good you know it's one of those movies i think if you've got a young teenage kid or a tween 
[01:54:30]  that you could take them to uh they'll enjoy it and you won't feel like i just absolutely wasted an  hour and a half of my life you didn't have to put on a tutu or wings i did not have to put on  more wings but i guarantee there's a scene where someone gets punched and his feet go all the way  up and and you see his feet in the camera and straight up in the air i guarantee he punches  someone straight up in the air i don't believe that there's one there's a whole not a whole lot  of fighting in this movie but really there is one scene where i do actually punch a guy and he does go 
[01:55:00]  up in the air but in all fairness when we shot it i shattered his nose oh you fucked up that's some  von claude uh don't call my damn shit you made a bad mistake a little too close on the uh tight shot  and yeah i caught him right in the end of the nose and that's that was that was almost a slight case  of murder there that whole bone up in the nose thing there my friend you got big fists good thing we  got it on that take now are you are you are you done uh no no no i'll be back shortly um just uh 
[01:55:30]  took some time off i made two movies for the company and then i tore my bicep and uh ironically  i leave wrestling to make a movie and i tear my bicep but yeah right well it was an injury i'd had  for a couple of years just kept nagging and then it finally just gave when i was making the movie but um  i i tore that had some surgery and stuff so i've been out for a little while we to this day talk about  your injury where your leg uh muscle rolled up like yeah oh god yeah this one i saw it we bring 
[01:56:00]  this up all the fucking time because we can't believe you just hanging on muscle out they just  limped out he pulled the muscle to the point that the thing rolled all the way up right i tore it i  completely tore my quad off the bone at the knee and it rolled up my thigh how do you come back live tv  and i finished the match yeah man that's unbelievable that's why i always say the wrestling i've been a  wrestler fan my entire life and i'm telling you the greatest actors slash stuntmen ever like the 
[01:56:30]  shit they do and they always got to go to right after a match they run to a doctor back there  to have somebody push something back in fix something but you know they also remember lines  like they're not fucking shakespearean but they remember fucking lines and they remember it's it's a  great it's just kind of the choreography of uh yeah if an actor tore their quad that movie is  shut down for like six weeks tom cruise tears a quad you can't fake doing a like a monkey salt 
[01:57:00]  on top of a dude laying on the ladder like there's nothing right right and you have 290 pounds and  you're flying yeah gravity is gravity what makes it even harder and what this is what people don't get  about what we do is then they watch you do that and they go oh my god how do these guys make it through  that you got to do it tomorrow right yeah do it not do it again you're gonna do it again yeah yeah  that's the thing that's the fucking thing people know this is a one of the there's a lot of  differences between when i watched it i tell you what they don't have anymore that i think they should 
[01:57:30]  have is jobbers they don't it's like why every week do i watch you fight john cena then there's a  pay-per-view of him watching fighting john cena but before it would be rudy rudy uh diamond of the  guys that come out in the tights and the yeah the wrestling i i agree we have this discussion all  the time and it's real is really comes down to just ratings it really comes down like why don't you  beat the shit out of some nobody just dragging him around mushing his face and then wait and then 
[01:58:00]  johnny rods punch him in the face right get on top one two and then pull him up and the guys  and he just he just to abuse him yeah oh yeah that's just to speck him up he does the finishing  move seven times on the guy it's just why why they don't look like that  sam roberts really taking a beating in that ring wow you know the best one 
[01:58:30]  maybe not that's creepy remember sd jones sd special was the best guy who lost every week  greatest jobber that ever lived but kurt hennon used to be a job i remember when stars with  jobbers and the wwf would go to wcw and become not jobbers they become really good and then come  back and now they're fucking actually wrestlers yeah but it was so many i remember the fucking  jobbers that it was great but they don't do it no more so it's like i gotta watch the miz fight a real 
[01:59:00]  dude everybody wants and then and then everybody gets to talk there was only a few talkers now  everybody's yapping i like what the job is really bothering him yes because i'm a wrestling fan it's  like you earn talking the jobbers would come in not say a word but they would they would move around  like they had a shot they'd be like yeah yeah like very cocky they were the only one there that  didn't know they were about to get ass whooping yeah but then you know for the first couple of  minutes they would win they would be winning like oh my god how's this job it would turn over 
[01:59:30]  and then yeah it would turn i love that oh never saw that coming yeah never saw that coming where's  uh where's shane like what happened with shane he i he kind of yeah he just decided on his own yeah  he decided he wanted to go out and try to make his own way and do his own thing but we thought he  had something when he came in here we're like okay you're leaving wrestling what are you doing and  we thought he was going to announce some big you know job politics something no he he's trying to do  his own thing he's got a couple of gigs uh going on he's got like um a company that does uh represents 
[02:00:00]  athletes uh through europe and like he's got a bunch of golfers and stuff so he's doing all right  and then he's also um he's creating a company that is going to in china there's no pay-per-view  distribution and he's trying to become the platform in china to distribute pay-per-view which that's one of  those things if it hits oh man it's huge if it doesn't hit you know i mean the difficult thing  about it is you it's a communist country right so you have to be careful you gotta go over there  and deal with them yeah eventually they can say this is great this is ours now yeah thank you take 
[02:00:30]  a hike yeah yeah and then this is the people's and he's gonna be knocking on and muscle him right  out of the country he's gonna be knocking on vince's door he's gonna have to live so let's be honest sir  uh wow we gotta how how awful how awful is this idea how much are y'all begging him to come back  and stop you know you know i hope he's successful i mean you know he means he's trying hard and you  know i i understand that trying to make your own your own way and make your own name his dad has to 
[02:01:00]  leave wwe to him it's it's it's it's destiny patrice we got we have william h macy outside and he  only has a few minutes so how are we going to do this triple you you want to stick around what do you  do all right all right you know william h macy yeah yeah oh yeah i thought you were talking to  patrice yeah get him in here william h macy how are you sir hello sir all right we got a full house  today yeah triple h from the wwe you got patrice o'neill very funny comic bill burr very funny comic 
[02:01:30]  anthony anthony what i had a hair on you jesus how about pleasure to meet you sir that's just  like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's definitely i would assume that that is uh hair  for the role i would assume that's hair for the role for shameless but that's good that you can grow  a head of hair like that he's like it i gotta say i don't doubt it yeah my wife damn i can't grow hair  like that that's the best part of being an actor no matter how you look you said no it's just for a role 
[02:02:00]  yes for a role yes the reason i'm so toasted in the morning is for research it's research  i was reading something uh obviously uh uh your your character uh on shameless uh drinks yeah well  drinks a little bit a little bit a little bit uh now you you stopped drinking yeah turn up his volume  roadie that mike iraq help him out help out uh william h macy shouldn't have to do that himself 
[02:02:30]  he's a big star well yeah his character drinks a little bit yeah yes i uh i've been known to  drink a bit myself i'm taking a little bit of a break for it it turns out i like drinking a whole  lot yeah yes like uh because i was reading that you kind of stopped and uh you're what are you scotch  man i do like scotch you like a good scotch you can tell by the color of my hair yeah it seems to do  the follicles well every once in a while i think it's a good idea though i i've suddenly realized  i have limited number of brain cells left and perhaps i should marshal my forces and just kind 
[02:03:00]  of uh twilight of my twilight well you seem to be able to uh work um yeah so it must not be out of  control i mean well no he's able to work he's done he says it's a great body of work i mean it's not like  it's gotten in the getting in the way well it's it's great to play a character that's lit up all  the time i mean for the first time in my life sometimes i'll hold the line so i can make more  faces i'm not kidding yeah it's a it's a great thing frank the guy i play is a drinking alcoholic 
[02:03:30]  he's an addict he'll take anything so every single scene is just there's no wrong possible  in that role are you gonna get up off the floor and act because i'm i'm early and shameless the  first couple episodes you don't see uh william h no well you see he's on the floor sleeping and i'm  like it's a contractual thing i said i want to get a lot of rest okay no i i bring that up because 
[02:04:00]  everyone says no it becomes uh you know you know you're way more in it a lot more but i'm only two  episodes in and so far you know the rest of the character went to canada yeah yeah the rest of the  rest of the characters are holding their own certainly and then william h macy shows up to  sleep on the floor that's what that's so far what i've seen my entrance into the series yes  unconscious yes mumbling you know you've made the big time when you can sleep and get paid  right there yeah is that what made you sign on you're like all right i get to sleep for the first 
[02:04:30]  three episodes totally chill we're just beating him up he's a great actor honestly uh shameless is  based on a british show i did not know this it's a great series too same title uh yeah uh and we've  got some of the same people working on ours the creator the thing paul has been helping with us  and the guy that directed their pilot directed our pilot it's at once the same and completely  different it's an american version and i believe like uh like the office it's a it's a successful 
[02:05:00]  transfer are you glad it's uh not on a network that you're able to really go go the full distance  because sometimes shows seem like they have so much potential but they put them on a network and  it's like ah come on i want to hear realistic speech i want to hear some real language it's a double-edged  sword on one hand on the networks you make the serious money because they do so many more uh but  you're right uh having written for television a good bit it's tough you can have no language no 
[02:05:30]  no drinking for the most part yeah i once wrote a thing where a 14 year old girl smoking a cigarette  they said you're joking right yeah yeah that's wouldn't even consider it like it never happened  yeah 14 year there's something about just taking reality out of uh uh network television i know which  is not only can people not smoke cigarettes but if they do smoke cigarettes they better die  you know this uh they're shameless they're smart too it it opens up with uh william h macy's 
[02:06:00]  teenage is she a teenager she's probably in her early 20s i guess running the household just  walking around trying to get everyone ready because you know he's irresponsible he's drunk somewhere  and she's walking around the house and just a t-shirt no bra and i'm like okay i i can handle this  show oh she's very smart looking at emmy rossom she's that and then she's naked by the end of the  first episode with the guy from the club having sex on the floor i should warn you already that you're  gonna see me naked i was gonna bring that up that's the one episode i saw my girl was like  yeah william h macy's in this i love this guy and then i see your ass and i'm just like jesus christ 
[02:06:30]  it beats working uh i thought it was bad enough in his boxers trying to get out that window  is this the hotel okay all right we're trying to we're trying to hold back we're all huge far  who isn't huge for three lines a thousand times mr smith they go who who just every what a just a  catastrophe of screw-ups on uh on that character's part which is just a brilliant character it's like a 
[02:07:00]  a despicable yet such a sympathetic character and i think uh you you've pulled that off so well over  the years in a lot of the characters you've played not that it's a typecasting or anything but um like the  the other one what was the one uh the cooler yeah boogie nights was another prime example of just  great poor son of a yeah like oh my god well it turns out if you can do that well you can have two  homes yeah uh god bless you did he just nicely say i'm rich good guy i like that yeah i gotta practice 
[02:07:30]  doing shit like that i think that's what he said in a matter of fact way i sympathize my way to two  homes my friend uh in the cooler you were able to take that whole kind of you know loserish character  but that was a leading role for you and uh it kind of it turned around uh during that movie where you  turned into more of a a winner well are you a method actor by the way are you like when you work in are 
[02:08:00]  you like a drunk guy and i can't like when the guy says cut you're not like hey so i like life  or are you like still fucking drunk guy like what you fargo the whole time fargo no no i i don't do  that and i actors who do that are really boring to me any you know made a few movies here and there's so much 
[02:08:30]  waiting around you would be off camera more in that character than you would be on camera  i never have some fun i can't have fun i have to stay in this character i'm a serial killer yeah  and it doesn't help it doesn't help in the end no it's exhausting and it doesn't help it just annoys  the crew they probably want a human being there to deal with and the most important fact is you can  still have two homes without it yeah see so it seems to have worked i gotta ask you something something  we were all curious about in uh boogie nights the line you said whether it was a flub or not 
[02:09:00]  uh she has an ass in her cock that's right uh was that a flub i did take one i said it correctly  take two uh paul anderson said you said um ass in her cock i said i did i'm so sorry um take three i  did it right take four i did it again he said you did it again i said i didn't i swear to you i didn't  so uh it ended up in the film there was some um there was some hidden truth in it i guess  well a cock is a cock is a is is a pussy like it's a it's a street lane since when yeah 
[02:09:30]  who's who you've been talking i'm saying i'm telling you pimp talk a cock is a is a twat  as the official brother of the room yes he's telling you i'm just telling you that's why  people are going to pick up on this i think it was more like yeah yeah that's a two-year buffer  period we got to go through as white people to pick up on black vernacular so william h mason was ahead  of his time in that fucking movie no he's trying to help you out william that would be something  that character would have done it's like to screw up because you're just so frustrated in that moment 
[02:10:00]  that you're screwing up i think that that was uh probably yeah more of the angle they were going  for there were you were you ever afraid of even though the characters uh though they had similarities  were a lot different were you ever afraid of becoming typecast as like here's this guy you know  this poor sap kind of guy really sure and still am did you are you really well yeah because this  kind of something well in hollywood they'll certainly ask you to do it again do it again  right well this role the cooler is a good example i turned that film down about three times i thought 
[02:10:30]  i gotta call a moratorium on this loser character that i'm doing but it was too good to turn down  that's why like frank gallagher the character i'm playing now he's he made he's certainly a loser but  he's got a lot of power to it yeah yeah it's not the pathetic no no not at all not at all uh that  you usually play yeah i realize we haven't even really explained shameless in your in your own words  what's uh what's the show about it's tough i play frank gallagher the uh addicted alcoholic parent of six 
[02:11:00]  kids uh they make their way through the world as best they can hilarity ensues trying to get  guidance i'm on board i'm gonna watch that sounds good it's great it really is i don't like anything  and i particularly usually don't like the stuff i'm in this is fantastic so what was that your  reaction when you got when you first got offered the project i mean because i i would think that  you have just have a stack of scripts outside your door every day i'm glad you think that no that  doesn't happen really outside level do you have to get to two doors bill two doors on both coasts 
[02:11:30]  right i think there are about four actors in the world that get have the choice of anything they  want to do i'm not one of them um i no i liked it immediately i read the script by john wells it  was a fantastic script and then i saw the series the british series and i was sold oh wow do you  have a trouble uh changing the character a little to adapt to you uh when you see a series that is  being adapted from a british series i would think it's kind of hard not to try to almost do an  impression of the guy well i stopped watching it was oh you did it's good enough that i realized i 
[02:12:00]  better not watch i do that with trailers now because movie trailers keep away too much information  so uh if i have an on-demand movie and i'm like i'm not sure if i want to see that i hit the trailer  i'm like okay good enough i'm watching it like two seconds they show you all the way up to the  resolution of the third act yeah i don't i don't need to see that i don't know why they do that the  best one ever the best one ever was speed 2 when they actually showed them getting off of the boat  and running around the island so it just killed the whole suspense of how are we going to stop the  boat it's like well obviously they stop it somehow right that was another thing with uh what was that 
[02:12:30]  tom hanks on the island uh movie there castaway during the trailer i mean they show him yeah back  home and trying to get into this relationship with his his ex-girlfriend there it was like well they  show the oil tanker picking him up he gets off the island and the whole thing that he's going to kill  himself or something or live there forever right it just uh trailers they really have just destroyed  uh movie watching and is there a neighbor will is there a hollywood uh uh uh is there a hollywood 
[02:13:00]  stigma to doing tv after you're doing movies your whole careers do they look at you like like i can't  help it but i look at chris christian uh what's his name there slater slater like uh-oh like i like  like i'm saying but is hollywood look at it like oh shit william h is doing oh he's on showtime  could be i definitely there used to be but used to in all honesty i gotta say right now i think the 
[02:13:30]  best stuff being done anywhere is being done on television yep i gotta agree with you i see the  the little indies that come out every once in a while there's one that's great there's a a film or two  each year that comes out this great but the most challenging stuff the best stuff is on television and  and i think you're seeing a lot more actors uh with reputable careers yeah uh going to especially  the cable outlets and uh things like that uh and putting out some good stuff you know buscemi  steve buscemi he's going to his show yeah uh boardwalk empire also i really like to act i like to do it 
[02:14:00]  a lot and when you do a tv show you get to act a lot and as you were saying when you do a feature  you get to sit around and wait a lot yeah so there's not a whole lot of working involved  sometimes uh triple h has to go but he doesn't know how to leave because all the mics are on  and william h macy's talking but yeah i wish i didn't have to leave because i'm a huge fan for  him and uh i really enjoy your work yeah so but unfortunately i do have to go what show are you  going to do i don't know they get people out there tell me just telling you go in that room and talk 
[02:14:30]  just give uh i get excited to come on things like this and other than that it's just a tv show  well triple h was you know is promoting the chaperone uh yes it's in theaters today right  yep comes out today very cool all right very cool all right guys thanks for the time  tell the guys uh tell the guys we said hi i will we we really remember us  i'll uh look forward to seeing you guys again tell vince thanks for that xfl game day gig 
[02:15:00]  i should bring you guys back do some more stuff you really should yeah that was 10 years ago  already fuck was it 10 years yeah it's just uh 10 years this past for the xfl wow we might need  the xfl again yeah i'll tell you it felt like 10 years that two months crazy time that was some wild  times there yeah well and we've done some tv you know yeah a little bit what are you gonna do  clean up when it wasn't cool yeah yeah all right guys thanks all right we'll see you take it easy 
[02:15:30]  yeah and uh shameless uh show time yeah another person on instant feedback going look uh william h  macy isn't in the show but he's telling us that he's going to be in the show a lot more this guy's  two uh episodes in yeah saying that macy's just kind of laying around so far you'll see more of me  than you want to i like the fact that uh you know what else is good about this this time we're living  in is uh on demand and being able to look at some of these shows on showtime without having to be 
[02:16:00]  there uh and watch it live i mean uh it it's a lot more convenient i know you've gone back and tried  to watch television where you have to sit through the commercials it really is infuriating they're  louder there's more television than there is programming yeah and then i like when the local  spot jumps in and the sound is so bad because it's like some local car dealership i know that they  went to and i just love that they decide they thought if they made it louder that would like 
[02:16:30]  like commercials were already annoying let's let's you know let's badger them with that i've heard they  actually do things now you know because because of tivo you don't get credit uh as far as like  ratings like tivo doesn't count because they know people fast forward and they have this thing now  you know if you fast forward these advertisers they have like ways of like when you fast forward  they'll still have their products so you still kind of see it on some level it's it's really uh  gotten to a psycho level that's why you know hey showtime gotta love it yes because pay for it  you don't have to yeah because you're not dealing with commercials you get the whole show it's not 
[02:17:00]  like you're getting 20 minutes of programming and 20 minutes of commercial hate that too i know our  show is 55 minutes long my wife's on a tv show and hers is sometimes 42 minutes is an hour yeah yeah  who's your wife felicity huffman she's on desperate housewives yeah yeah of course  this is delicious  would you have got that without shameless you think  i don't know i think fargo got him that one yeah fargo maybe you picked the wrong show come on 
[02:17:30]  we're all out of our leagues we all know it just stop it doesn't hurt to be married  oh that's great man jesus christ uh she's also on sunday night too we just barely missed oh  really with each other that's that's good that that didn't happen yeah that would uh probably cause  some uh that would be another show idea there you go some friction right and uh i guess no haircut  in the future well you gotta live with you gotta live with that i might do an indie uh i got a 
[02:18:00]  couple of films we're on our hiatus right now so it remains to be seen whether and keep sure they  can make a wig out of that like i don't know a shameless wig oh that looks pretty he's keeping the  hair waiting to see if there's another season no he said he's gonna do a movie he's not playing  he's keeping the hair for shameless we're gonna do another season they haven't picked it up yet but  do you it's are you always acting do you take time right now yeah much more than i wish really  sure yeah but felicity huffman being on a popular show you could take some time off there's nothing 
[02:18:30]  wrong with digging in her pockets hey that's true man fall in love with a rich girl y'all get divorced  she's gonna fucking get you take her money now save it and give it back to her after the divorce  i live in california man it's our money that is true oh brutal i wouldn't wish that on anybody  believe me yeah i went through it i went through that years ago and oh boy free for a little while 
[02:19:00]  now took a while yeah many years it's been free for no i mean free from the the check right from  having to write that check yeah and for the check right can i ask a fargo question sir i'm a i'm a big  fan of of the cohen brothers i i love the cohen brothers what is is their process like are they  cool are they are they weird guys or like is it it's just is it a fun thing or is it a a really 
[02:19:30]  professional thing you know like i don't you know what i mean are they cool yes yes yes and yes they're  weirdos they are sort of uh film geeks they've seen every film ever made they are exquisitely  prepared they're very fun to be on the set with uh uh it's about it's about the best working experience  you could have they're not they're not mentioned when people talk about great filmmakers man i think  they're but they made they make fantastic i mean people start talking they'll be they'll talk 
[02:20:00]  martin scorsese's they'll talk uh uh uh she's a spielbert you you don't hear the cohen brothers you do  to people who love movies but you don't i mean i think they're under the radar still  the cohen brothers and they make great films miller miller's crossing is one of the best gangster movies  ever made true grit was fantastic yeah oh yeah i thought i think their their place in history is  great patrice no not so much but i'm never going to get i i love them and i need you to do me a 
[02:20:30]  favor sir is to let them know that i don't remember any black goddamn characters that's all i need you  to do is just say sirs cohen brothers yeah i remember i remember fargo i remember miller's crossing  every great little there's no black people in fargo did no i'm saying i'm saying it's just  nothing in the city it's fargo just what i'm saying put one in brothers are into realism so 
[02:21:00]  they're gonna do fargo put a chinese guy in fucking fargo everywhere there's chinese restaurants  everywhere i got sushi in nebraska it's hard to love love the cohen brothers like i do and they and  there's just no no black characters in there they've never pushed one they're playing the percentage i  mean they they they they fucking put over um harvey air bardoom this foreign guy they put him over  just put one black character over that's all i'm saying patrice o'neill i'm not even saying me 
[02:21:30]  i don't know if i can pull it off but they're great but i'm saying it's hard to stay focused  that's all you ever see him uh you ever see him get uh upset with each other on the set  anything like that it's kind of got to be hard to work one's kind of in charge though like  they it's never directed by them it's like directed by one of them and then the other one's  like the writer or something ethan writes more and joel directs more but they both do both i mean  they're they're amazing man they're damn amazing and one of them's married to uh the star of fargo 
[02:22:00]  francis mcdormand yeah what a great incestuous business  i love this business before they got married though  uh they they said it again they were making films together before oh francis mc right back in  but fargo is her big her big one though right she won an oscar what is your favorite role you ever  did like just like you go man i i you felt good when you after you did that one it's like naming  your favorite child you can't quite do that but uh i did a little film called happy texas that i 
[02:22:30]  just adored nobody ever saw it but i liked it um there's a mammoth film called state in maine i had  a great time and then i did one of the jurassic parks that was yeah yes oh you did that one of the  i'm sorry holy balls they were just running out of dinosaurs how about we invent one with a  fucking that has a smiley face and a hat and it's trying to make friends with this guy no i'm saying he 
[02:23:00]  knows but he maybe god damn nose what was your favorite like uh i want to go back to happy texas  actually because you said you liked that film why didn't anyone see it i don't know is it a film that  people should have saw yeah it's it's great you can rent it it's out but is it uh was it a marketing  issue was the subject matter maybe not for the mainstream no i think a marketing issue and you know  you can make a great film that no one wants to see right i don't think anybody's ever seen a movie 
[02:23:30]  that had the word that had the word happy in it i'd like i will say i don't know if there's any happy  gilmore happy gilmore come on man that's not fair i mean like because happy in serious movies is always  turns into something very but weird like yeah but can you tell by the way can you tell when after you've  made a movie when you see the marketing can you tell at this point going oh god they're not marketing  this right this is going to tank can you tell as you like you're sitting at home watching if you're 
[02:24:00]  excited about a movie and you're watching the advertising and just the way they're marked like  did you know as they were marketing happy texas like they're doing this all wrong you know it took  me a long time to get to this but the people that do marketing do have a talent right they're good at it  in the history of film no director has ever said i love the way they're releasing my film it's just  never happened okay yeah everyone's but um yeah i've seen it where i thought they  the marketing people tried to sell it as something that it's not and uh that never works well my 
[02:24:30]  point is that it's got to be frustrating for you you know the movie happy texas is a really good  film and then you see other films that everyone's seen and you know it's a piece of crap i know film  that's got to be just infuriating as an actor for a while the independent film market was a viable  market right right people see it but now that's because of the new technology that's in the met  that's a mess we we have to unfortunately wrap up but uh shameless uh i gotta acknowledge joan uh  cusack is in this oh she's amazing cusack she's an amazing actress she's still cutie pie and uh i'm

[02:27:00]  done it's a great film it goes all the way through the anger to then just the way you  swing it a sadness oh you've heard it absolutely brilliant i'm sure you've heard a thousand times  when when you're sitting uh on that bench in front of the door answering your son about what's going  on and and the dead father's in the trunk and then and you're just like okay yeah no no everything's  fine i'm gonna go to bed yeah hope it all goes away the guy's trying to get these trying to get the 
[02:27:30]  numbers off the the burnt cnf whatever and he's just saying okay okay no i can't read the numbers  yeah all right okay no no i mean message him oh it's amazing it's great writing that's not a weak  character that's not like improvising any like that's no no no i couldn't imagine anyone else  playing that though it's it's phenomenal you do such a great job that that character just  comes right off the the screen at you it's you you do such a perfect job playing that i feel like 
[02:28:00]  it's a comedy is there a story sir of of you of how you got that movie is there like isn't it a  there's a either somebody turned it down you got it or you fought really hard to get it or  hard i was a work a day actor i went in to read for a smaller role and they said do you want to read  jerry and i said yeah so i went out in the other room worked on it they said that's real good you want to  come in tomorrow i said yes so i was up all night every actor i know was at my house running the 
[02:28:30]  lines with me i went in the next day and i read again and because i knew i knew not only was it a  great script and it was the coen brothers but it was my role yeah i could just see it was written for  a portly bald guy really so it didn't work that way but i knew it was you was such a a great like  and then they went hard salesman did you did you feel what went after you did the audition did you  walk out going i nailed that i got that i did nail it and then i found out that they were in new york  auditioning so i got my skinny lutheran ass on an airplane and uh it's not an apocryphal story i 
[02:29:00]  walked in and i said i'm scared you're going to screw this up by giving the role to somebody else i read  again wow and uh i said i'll shoot your dog if you give this because ethan has a dog yeah isn't that  a mate like you're still like yeah i read it it was like it was more it was bigger than the average  like you read and got it it was like they had somebody else and he just would not let them go 
[02:29:30]  yeah we got one just one one more quick thing was there ever any story that you even heard from  the coen brothers as to why the character needed that money no no never okay so that was never resolved  and it's not important i've always felt everything you need is on the back story has never i think the  character itself you you realize he must have screwed something up sure and needed when was the last  time you saw the movie like we could put it on tomorrow and enjoy it again a couple of years 
[02:30:00]  i'll be perfectly honest i i was watching it last night it's got insane re-watch ability it really  does and i'm telling you i mean shameless is a great show i'm telling you sundays at 10 on showtime  i haven't had this much fun in a long time it's a great show the characters and the the situations  it's unbelievable get him out of here before we get in trouble all right yeah thank you boys  yeah thank you and you got to say it though you got to say it as he leaves oh yeah he's fleeing the  interview oh he's fleeing the interview he's fleeing the interview why don't you go talk to

[02:33:00]  to do those crappy little i'm not going to mention the show yeah he had a great time here yeah totally  different when when when i saw him being interviewed on well he's an edgy guy though he's like you could  tell yeah he goes to the nasty show in in uh in uh montreal and yeah he's a he's but he's just a  uh you know what what's the alcohol thing about with him that you hit him with he i wish we got  into that he likes to drink and he openly admits it right yeah he likes when you ask them i whoa  this could go bad but and i totally related that too no he that's that's exactly like me i i i'm not 
[02:33:30]  an alcoholic but i fucking love drinking drinking and my big head already just becomes bloated i had i  haven't drank since october i just had a layoff wow really just take a oh take a little break dude it's  it's so easy to become an alcoholic in this business i don't have to go to work till like  eight at night so every is basically a saturday it's never you can just sit around in your pajamas  drinking doesn't matter yeah oh i'm hung i drank too much i'll sleep till two fuck it yeah sleep right 
[02:34:00]  through the hangover it's gone but you'll believe that he likes the scotch huh the hard stuff how do you  not yeah drink some that means he likes to get drunk he's got a scotch face when you drink certain  things like if you drink a kalua and milk it's like you like to drink but if you're drinking like  straight whiskey that's like you like to get drunk no it's more of a it's a you're it's a  educated drinker where you you just you're cutting out all the  bullshit there's no umbrella there's no mixer right you're getting right to this stuff you put 
[02:34:30]  one ice cube in the middle of it you actually want to taste the burn but is that okay okay  yes all right so that but that's enjoyable i mean like yeah all right fair enough no yeah it's like  everything in moderation but the thing is the funny thing about scotch is the first time you drink it  it tastes like you're drinking out of an ashtray it's the worst goddamn thing you ever had but after  like six weeks of drinking it you'll find yourself alone drinking one and going like ah and just feeling  your whole body relax and that's a frightening moment i've lived that out of the 14 people that i that i 
[02:35:00]  gave uh the gift you gave me i opened on on um oh the louis the fourth 13th deluded 13th i opened on  uh thanksgiving oh you did probably four people like enjoyed it in the manner it should be enjoyed  appreciate it you got a shot left for me by the way i have this much left i i i held that  shit like a baby like everybody had their glass even people who didn't i had to have one just to  have one what it tastes like um i don't know that's fair but i drank it down and i said that 
[02:35:30]  fucking seventeen hundred dollars liquor is down the system a long time ago a comedy club gave me  an in uh louis the 13th uh bottle of uh bourbon uh a cognac thank you how much is that a bottle  it's a hundred and depending on the restaurant it's easily a hundred dollars a shot sometimes a  bit higher than that even if you go to a liquor store you can get it for like 80 bucks a bottle  no like johnny walker blue it's like it's like 1800 bucks it's like it's cheap it's like 1800 
[02:36:00]  okay the empty uh crystal bottle that comes in you could get a few hundred bucks yeah right five or  six i had this thing laying around forever i'm like i'm never gonna enjoy this so i gave it to  patrice one day whatever but i i always wonder what it takes i held it like a baby but then i open it  for i mean i i open it a little wax thing i read the whole history kept the box yeah i was actually  nervous having it because when i first got it was all your i'm let me it was all your back and  forth uh like your teeter and whether it was going to open or not it was all his fingerprints on it 
[02:36:30]  like going let me open it today i think you can clone me with that bottle so yeah is this a special  enough event no no something better is going to happen in my life you know what i should have  fucking polished that before i gave it to you he's right there's got to be a hundred of my  fingerprints but i was wiping and i was like holy this is making me nervous i had it put up but i  opened it i said fuck it i'm opening for thanksgiving everybody got a little shot  and uh about three people buddy of mine um i don't know if my mother even could my mother's  a wine drinker and then the rest it was like three people and then one other guy said holy 
[02:37:00]  shit was a was a honduras guy a guy from honduras who fixes my walls and shit he's a big time  uh cognac drinker and he's like holy shit really paint pants and he had a smile on his face like  somebody that enjoys uh good cigars you know what i'm saying so it was it was pretty that's  why i had to pass it on i know i wouldn't have but i don't know if it's smooth i try to drink but  beer is just ridiculous to me i i it's like it you i see how much people love it yeah i try to drink 
[02:37:30]  it it's not enjoyable it doesn't it doesn't go down beer wonderfully love it guinness is a tasty  thing it's adult soda look if i had to choose yeah guinness is like an adult shake guinness yeah  right see anything i'm gonna say that's a great drink that's a malted milk for a  yeah tremendous giving me the finger ah faggot you drink you drink uh what's the other one i'll  fuck with uh uh natural light what's the line corona corona and but i okay can i say a beer that i 
[02:38:00]  enjoy if i have any cores extra gold i'm sorry i'm sorry it's no but that's the thing though  it tastes good i like bud light but you're you're allowed your teenage beer like the first beer i  ever got like hammered on was michelo blight and to this day anytime i have one it takes me back to  faneuil hall in boston sitting in the parking lot getting hammered for the first time and i was like  17 so so i and i hate mick i hate mick ultra because everybody carries that now and you don't 
[02:38:30]  have a mick light you have to go like the middle i don't be it's hard to find yeah i used to like  michelo too growing up yeah i don't know why but i guess that was just regular michelo used to be  good i that was like your classy friend would bring that by the house a six-pack because in suburbia  how about those seces uh nah greatest beer ads in a long time but yeah i'm not really into that  when i was when i was growing up uh out there in long island in suburbia you'd invite your friends 
[02:39:00]  over the house and they'd bring their own beer their own little six-pack you know and you'd you'd see  what you know a buddy would come up the stairs and he'd have his millers and he'd be like ah you  faggot what do you drink miller for yeah i got my bud and then another guy would come in with his  michelobs and like you were all known for your beers oh michelo some cheap fucking bring meister  brow and put it in the fridge and try to take like a michelobe and you're like fuck you drink  your shitty fucking beer i'm not touching that so what's the what's the what's the top beer now uh 
[02:39:30]  i don't know it's gotta be up yeah but you know something your standard fucking issue budweiser is  just really but it's so no but you're talking like a numbers thing this is almost like stand-up  comedians like just because someone's you know selling out the spectrum yeah because sam adams  sam adams okay so what's up what's a beer that people go okay thank you for bringing this you  brought it you brought it to a place where everybody's drinking beer heineken i would say  yeah heineken and then there's specialty beers now that bring them it's like sam adams 
[02:40:00]  the amount of people that they've probably knocked off the wagon the way they sit there with those hops in  their hands and stuff like and those awesome beer glasses i just sit there going you motherfuckers i'm  trying to trying to go 100 days here stop with these commercials in germany like rubbing hops in  his hands and smelling it and it's like that must be delicious and is this a boutique thing or they're  big time now they're they're not a boutique thing anymore but uh they have they have a pretty small 
[02:40:30]  market share compared to budweiser but uh they're they're they're pretty big i think they're doing  just fine if you go if you drink and then have to go it just seems like it's not an enjoyable thing  like apple juice is enjoy but that's like a rookie thing beer that's like a rookie after a while you  get used to that that burn and you can actually start to taste the flavors i'm telling you that's  when you start having a problem like that scotch thing i'm telling you it tastes like i just drank a 
[02:41:00]  liquid cigar and then like then it was like six months later or whatever i was drinking and it was just  like it was starting to take the edge off yeah i'm starting to feel like lou grant remember that  like how how acceptable drinking was that was a goddamn sitcom yeah and he would pull  man relax have a shot and just take out like a bottle of whatever honey make me a double i'm  scared home from work i'm scared for burr man i think you're gonna drink tonight and we keep talking  like no i i i've gone like i've gone like a long enough time i'm not into weed like my girl gave me 
[02:41:30]  uh one of those uh pot cookies like weed is basically illegal it's basically legal yeah in  la we uh we she gave me one of those pot cookies i just don't like i feel like it's like compressing  my brain yeah i just don't like it i wasn't a weed guy is there something like that liquor like  like when you have liquor i'm not a liquor drinker so like so let's say a really hard liquor yeah with  something like some kind of food like you're eating you finish eating and then it's like oh 
[02:42:00]  this just like like like milk and a piece of cake like you don't yeah yeah i'll tell you if i if i have  a uh yeah a steak or something a nice red wine a shiraz like a nice red australian shiraz but not  hard liquor no no that's no you gotta go wine with but i'm saying hard liquor is something that  hard liquor is enjoyable i just can't believe hard liquor captain and coke that's sweet tastes like 
[02:42:30]  candy no no i'm telling you the more the more you drink the less you put in it and it's like i like  vodka like all i want is a lime and the smallest ice cube ever i want belvedere yeah no i like that  doesn't sound enjoyable bill it sounds trace you're missing you know it's good that you don't  trees i need the mixer this is it sounds like something you do like people enjoy cigarettes  you go i get it i do get it but i'm saying it's you know this is this i'll equate it to stand-up if 
[02:43:00]  you like stuff in your alcohol that's like people who like a comic with like a catchphrase you know  what i mean and like just drinking the alcohol that's when you just like the real deal the dude who  can just stand there and tell jokes and fucking kill it's the rich prior as far as like drinking  yeah it's the george carlin yeah that's like the real deal and if yeah if you have like the  umbrella all right that's more like the carrot top going down that going down that road the  mixers in a drink are like the props for a prop comic and not only that that's the thing that  gives you the big hangovers when you have all that extra sugar and all that shit in there it's 
[02:43:30]  obvious we're heading this way but let's set it up officially this is a little dangerous though  i'm gonna name a comic and you give me their drink holy shit you went richard prior's pretty much  straight up right there's a i i know sinatra's drink was uh i think it was whiskey with one one  ice cream like how about uh we'll go uh we'll go uh we'll go with a uh like a gallagher we'll go  easy gallagher is a slow gin fizz is gallagher like a slow gin fizz it's just all i never never met  him to be fair to him no just taking their comedy okay okay if richard prior is like straight up like 
[02:44:00]  vodka whiskey whatever i gotta be a shirley temple with the red hair a little shirley temple  for gallagher no for me i'm saying gallagher if you watch him his old school gallagher gallagher  did some goofy shit but he always he was trying to say some oh some political so i would say he  has something in the drink some substance sweeten it up but it's not he's a girly drink some booze 
[02:44:30]  cranberry and vodka i would say he's a cranberry and vodka never showed his audience that he's as  intense as he is and as intelligent he tried though watch his specials he we broke him down  on the show if you remember patrice i think he's mad at us by the way is he yeah yeah because he's a  fucking racist and he said he's he's mad at us because he said we made everyone think he's a  racist dude i got five stories about it dude this is why this show is awesome we went from michelo 
[02:45:00]  like to gallagher's a racist in like eight minutes should i say alleged because i don't  want to get sued but i'm just saying i've heard some fucking he's gonna hit you with that hammer  with my teeth on the sidewalk  give me another comic that maybe you know and then we could uh make a drink up for him  i don't know where we want to go with this i kind of like we all know too many people  maybe we should back out everybody's too should we back out on this one too friendly yeah that's 
[02:45:30]  fair enough with each other you're right yeah yeah let's insult their acts it's amazing that you lit  up on that one oh there's a good ankle i try to burn less bridges myself yeah i mean but you know  it's super simple i'm off the bridge because you have something that come on like you know you  did i know the ones i want to say and i know what the drink would be i mean you know and gallagher was a  very safe you know yeah well i went obvious but then we were going to start getting into the  and i got guys we're going to get to the middle ground but it's like 
[02:46:00]  and there's people probably listening there might be a lot of comics listen to the  can we talk in code and just talk about the drink  hold up the name oh yeah that's watermelon flavored vodka right there that's a faggot and rocks  faggot on the rocks and a dirty glass that piece of shit that's a fuzzy navel if i ever saw one  motherfucker fuzzy navel shit  it's too much man you know i looked at you you look yeah 
[02:46:30]  it's just because because you can just go on and on hey dogs are biting people we can talk about  that oh we talked about during the break i love the chihuahuas are finally yeah they're  they're finally getting exposed i don't know brutal pieces of those little bug-eyed psychos they got  the top five nasty dogs i guess because they're nipping and biting and the chihuahua makes it that  piece of shit dog i hate chihuahuas dude it's the owner i hate this is the thing like i would pet a  pit bull before i pet a fucking chihuahua really faps a fucking luli i wouldn't and i own a pit bull 
[02:47:00]  i wouldn't dude they just give people dogs down the shelter with no training whatsoever like they  did with me i love your dog rant dude i'm telling you no i've i had to take it to this dude who used  to work with the dog whisperer the shit that i learned i've been doing this bit in my act like  even when i used to rough house with the dog when you get the energy all amped up you got to bring  it back down again and i didn't realize that i'd rough house with it and then go take it outside and  my joke in my act is i'm walking outside totally relaxed but the dog is like walking through the 
[02:47:30]  tunnel at the rose bowl like this is what we play for and i have no idea i take this thing down to  this thing this thing almost ate a landscaper and i had no idea how to how to handle it on the leash  this is six months dude six months of my life i spent working with this dog trainer now my dog  is is totally cool totally like i didn't even realize like they pick up on your vibe you just  look check it out if you're laying down on the couch chilling they're laying down but if you're  if you're driving down the street going all this motherfucker cut me off the dogs in the back yeah 
[02:48:00]  fuck that dude like he starts getting like i never get one of those yeah i understand i'm telling you  i understand on a much smaller level with my with my son if i amp him up too much when i want to go to  bed i'm gonna fucking pay for that yeah so you realize don't fucking amp him up if you want to go to sleep  and then the baby's you got to wear them out so they wear them out a little bit yeah so but with  you with the pit bull you're fucking ramping him up and thinking he's just gonna be calm when you  leave the house to my it's it's the best goddamn dog like the level with which i love i love this 
[02:48:30]  dog it's it's ridiculous what is it again a blue uh a blue nose that's the color that's right yeah  he's gorgeous well that's the number one dog that bites people 815 bites in the new york area  815 huh but it's not only the owners not know people don't know they don't know how to approach  dogs i had a dog this dude comes up to my dog one time he starts snapping his finger like right in  her face is she friendly starts snap it's like that's smart yeah it's like dude what would you  do if someone was doing that to you right in your face yeah you would hit the head so the dog freaks  out and he looks at me like oh pit bulls it's like no you right yeah i sound like one of those psychos 
[02:49:00]  defending pit bulls i know i know they're maniacs i realize they're just they're dangerous like i said  they just look and i love dogs but i can't bring myself to and i don't and i can say it because i  because you're not because i'm nervous you know i can't i do the whole stick my hand out the smell  but i'm really you know what dog i'm you know what dog i'm petrified of and you don't like sharks you  don't see them a lot german shepherds is my number one what the fuck happens to dogs where we don't see  them anymore german shepherds you just don't see anymore doberman pinchers where the yeah yeah
