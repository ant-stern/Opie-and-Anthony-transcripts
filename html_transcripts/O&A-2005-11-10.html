<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment focused on a Dateline NBC exposé of online predators.  The hosts played graphic audio clips from the show, detailing the conversations and arrests of men who believed they were interacting with underage children.  The men's reactions to being confronted by the Dateline crew, ranging from panicked escapes to unconvincing alibis, provided much of the comedic fodder. Notable examples included "Aladdin," who claimed dyslexia, and "Naked Guy," who arrived naked and later agreed to meet at McDonald's.  Patrice O’Neal was in studio, participating in the discussion alongside the hosts, who also interspersed the Dateline clips with jokes about Casey Kasem's voice and the supposed prevalence of pedophilia in Florida.  The segment concluded with Casey Kasem outtakes and a discussion of the show's growing marketing efforts.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Opie and Anthony's experiences at WNEW and their move to satellite radio.  They detailed their difficult relationship with management, feeling overshadowed by Howard Stern despite their high ratings.  They recounted a rejected lucrative offer from Clear Channel, a decision they regretted.  The hosts described their contentious relationship with Stern, including a gag order preventing them from mentioning his name on air and the various methods they used to circumvent it.  The fallout from a controversial stunt with Paul Mercurio at a church was extensively discussed, along with the hosts' frustrations with FCC regulations, listener complaints, and the perceived unfair treatment they received compared to Stern.  Anecdotes about interactions with Sarah Jessica Parker and an incident at the MTV Video Music Awards, allegedly orchestrated by Stern, were also shared.

The feud with Howard Stern continued to be a central theme.  The hosts recounted further instances of alleged sabotage by Stern, including preventing their access to private MTV events and refusing to attend a press conference until they were removed.  They also discussed a meeting with Mel Karmazin, fearing repercussions for their commentary on Stern and his daughter.  This segment also included a story about a confrontation with an enraged listener named Bernie, whose CD was confiscated, and a discussion about graphic videos from a PalTalk chat room featuring a man engaging in self-abuse with various objects.  The hosts discussed plans for a new media stunt involving a handkerchief and received a call about a car door replacement.  A brief interview with Dave Foley and a conversation with a homeless man named Blue, who had recently been robbed, concluded this segment.

The final segment focused on a lengthy and often vulgar conversation with Blue.  The conversation included discussions of Blue's past experiences, including working for Leona Helmsley and time spent in prison, where he was stabbed.  The hosts invited Blue to participate in their annual "homeless shopping spree".  A guest named Grey Wolf unexpectedly performed a song about homelessness, sparking discussion about the song's quality.  Blue attempted to sing but was unsuccessful.  The conversation then shifted to Star Jones' sorority experience, featuring audio clips and further off-color jokes about sorority life, racial dynamics and celebrity appearances. The show ended with plugs for future segments, listener voting, and the hosts' goodbyes.

[00:05:30]  Enough of that palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What's going on, Anthony?  Ah, just having a dandy, what is this, Thursday?  I have no clue anymore.  It's Thursday, yes.  Thrust Day?  What?  Yeah.  What, what, what, what?  Thrust Day.  Oh, I thought you said thrust.  No.  Thrust Day.  Yes, there is day.  What I like to call the day before the good day. 
[00:06:00]  The day before the day everybody just kind of waits for.  Well, tomorrow's Veterans Day.  Yes.  Yes.  Salute our veterans.  All I know is I don't have to move my car tomorrow.  I think the day's a little more important than that.  I just know I don't have to move my car.  No alternate side parking regulations, in fact.  These holidays are a beautiful thing.  Yes.  When you're...  How many millions of dollars the city loses?  Got to hear about that.  Yeah, whatever. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  They're doing just fine.  Patrice O'Neill in studio once again today.  Of course.  And we couldn't be happier.  Very happy to have Patrice on board.  Now what sucks?  It's now, what, 706 on the East Coast?  Mm-hmm.  We just did an hour of radio.  Why don't we just throw mics on in the office?  Oh, he's good.  And then we could, like, host.  Then we just sit back.  Because now I feel like we entertained a lot of people, but we've just entertained ourselves.  Not just ourselves.  You know?  Because right now we can just push play and sit back and go, ah, look what we did already.  But you know what?  I don't think we have a finite number of conversations to have about nothing. 
[00:07:00]  We're all kind of, we all kind of, like, do that.  Kind of interesting nothing kind of guys.  Interesting nothingness.  You know what I mean?  We could just talk about horse shit, you know what I mean?  It's like, when you do that, you just never run out of stuff.  It's pretty much the secret of the show.  Sometimes there's magical horse shit.  Like, you could hear Opie, like, editing even regular conversations with me and you.  Like, yeah, man, he's goddamn Arab.  And Opie's like, all right, this is going nowhere.  He's just like, he's like, no, Opie, there's no one listening.  We'll just move on here. 
[00:07:30]  We'll just move on.  We'll move on.  We're going to clear this out.  You're going to press a button.  Yeah, we'd have gone another two hours on some bullshit.  Hey, we got this thing on the nanny here.  Wait a minute, we're having a regular conversation on here.  I do do that in my regular life, too, man.  I got one brother on the phone.  I'm like, ah, you're boring.  I'm going to call another brother.  He's more interesting.  All right, thanks for spending a few minutes with us this afternoon.  He'll make a sound in the background.  Fang!  Yeah.  You suck!  Boring!  It's like, wait a minute, Opie.  Witches, friends, having a conversation. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Yapping.  Sometimes we forget the reason we all come together at six in the morning.  We are friends, and we're talking, but we're also trying to, like, you know, shape a show  together.  Yeah, kind of pound one together.  If you want to really just hang as friends, let's get out of this, let's get to 11 o'clock,  and we'll go hang at the Brooklyn Diner or something.  Now you're talking just plain crazy.  But as soon as I walk in here, it's, I'm in show mode.  Come on.  Is that right?  Oh, I'm listening to every single conversation going on in this building, thinking, all right, 
[00:08:30]  we could use that.  We could use that.  That sucked.  I won't go there.  I used to do that as a comic, and I just found that I started running, like, every time  I thought something was funny, I would try to do it on stage.  I always thought that it helped you a well of funniness to just be as funny as you could  all the time.  So I think it would help you a well of conversation to just talk about nothing all the time, so  you just don't run out.  You just don't run out of shit to say.  Well, no, what's frustrating is, like, there's some shit we do in that back office that is 
[00:09:00]  unbelievably funny.  So we go, ah, we're feeling good.  We come into here to try to do the same exact thing.  Nothing.  It never works.  Yeah, save it for the air, and it just comes off.  Well, that's what we do now.  If we know, like, whoa, that's way too good, we don't even finish it.  We're like, whoa, just say that.  Just stop.  Stop right there.  But that's taking a gamble, too, because you don't know if it would have fallen apart in the  office.  Right, right, right.  And I'll save it for the air.  You get to the point that you stop doing it in the office, and it falls apart.  Well, that's why I'm glad you guys haven't come on, because one thing that amazes me 
[00:09:30]  about radio is, like, these motherfuckers getting up every day and doing four and five  hours of what, how do you do it?  Oh, shit, how do you do it?  How do you do this?  And then people, like, there's a show that comes on, Party Interruption on ESPN.  I love that show.  And I never watch it going, ah, they probably had a bad day, didn't get no sleep.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Late, had a funny sleep day.  If they have a bad show, I go, you mother, you had a bad fucking show. 
[00:10:00]  Like, you don't get credit for yesterday or the day before.  Uh-uh.  It's like you got me good.  You are only as good as your last show.  So it's...  That's it.  That's what's frustrating.  You know, we had a great show yesterday, and we kind of enjoyed that for a few hours,  and then all of a sudden you have to think forward, all right, what are we doing tomorrow?  Now we go.  What are we doing tomorrow?  It does mess up the confidence because you go, oh, we had a great show yesterday.  Somebody calling.  And you really start to question if you fizzled out.  Like, I come here today, and I feel like, okay, all right, they had enough of me. 
[00:10:30]  All right, enough of Patrice.  Listen, I'm not going to come in tomorrow because they don't need to eat.  I don't want to, yeah, I don't want to overexpose myself.  Isn't Bobby available?  Good, Bob, because it's just ridiculous.  And I'm going, wait, these guys come in every day.  Every day to do this.  Every day.  And then when you have a bad show, you've got to sit there and eat it for 24 hours until,  you know, 20 hours, whatever it is, until you come in and get your next show.  And then you just, your whole insecurity goes, ah, man, you guys, you just go, ah, I think  I'm fizzling out. 
[00:11:00]  Maybe that's it.  Maybe after 10, 11 years, the tank's dry.  Maybe, ah, yeah, our better days are behind.  Puked out my last story.  I'm a 410-trick pony.  Maybe we can start drilling in Alaska, but I don't know.  Yeah, there's got to be something there.  We've got to move all the equipment up there.  Conversation shortage.  We've got to kill the wild, the wildlife, I don't know.  I don't know if it's worth it.  Yeah, to go somewhere we haven't gone yet.  Yeah, exactly.  A finite number of talent.  Can you imagine, it's like the NBA, it's like I'm an All-American in high school, in 
[00:11:30]  college, and then in the pro, I'm a, oh, no.  It's done.  See, we're not stupid.  We will ride you motherfuckers all the way to 11.  Oh, yeah.  That's the great thing about, I'm telling you, not to blow you guys.  I don't need to, you know, I know you guys long enough.  But that's the one thing when I did the first time, did the show on, uh, in, in the other  show.  Yeah, uh, N.E.W., yeah.  N.E.W., is that you dudes are let, let dudes, I go, no one lets any comics.  Come on for an hour and a half, two hours, and do, absolutely act stupid. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  For two hours.  And it's like, you know what, thank God, man.  Thank God.  It just seems to work.  You gotta be, uh, secure in what you do, you know.  Yeah.  We brought this up many times at the end of the day.  I mean, I got a lot of phone calls yesterday, how great the show was.  I didn't personally do much yesterday.  You killed.  Well, I believe.  But I get the credit at the end of the day.  Anthony gets the credit.  We get the credit.  I believe that the, that whole Seinfeld kind of thing where it's like, he never was funnier  than anybody. 
[00:12:30]  But it's like, he's the star.  You're never gonna be bigger than the star of the show ever.  That's what amazes me about Seinfeld.  The name on the opening credit.  Because he gets all the credit, but, I mean, come on, Jason Alexander.  He was never the funniest dude on the show.  Never was the funniest dude.  He was never killed on Seinfeld.  They were hilarious people, but it's like, he's the man.  But he's the man to look at as, no, you were the guy.  Yeah, man.  So, that's, I love coming, it's just, I love that shit.  It's funny, man, to come in and talk shit.  I know, just talk shit. 
[00:13:00]  And then the creepiness of some goddamn trucker going, hey, you know, I heard that the bird  flew.  It's like, what are you doing, you creepy motherfucker?  Who are you?  The whole medium really is a little creepy, isn't it?  You know, we're entertaining a mass murderer right now.  You know, there's a dude with some bodies somewhere doing, goddamn, those motherfuckers.  Really funny guys.  There's a dude sawn up a body right now, laughing, and just, you know, like, right now, sawn  it up with us blasting in the background.  There's somebody in the back going, mm, mm, mm, mm. 
[00:13:30]  Like some reservoir dog cut the ear off scene going on, but we're playing on the radio.  He's got his Wi-Fi on, and he's just digging a shallow grave somewhere in the middle of the  woods.  Hey, have you guys ever had somebody do that?  Have you ever had somebody do that in your career?  Like, call and go, help me, fellas.  Help me.  We had, like, a false alarm on some guy that said he murdered some people.  Yeah.  He turned out to just be a psycho.  We had detectives and everything.  Yeah, Eddie.  This guy, Eddie, called up and basically admitted to killing all sorts of drug dealers and burning 
[00:14:00]  up their bodies.  He was so believable.  Very detailed.  So believable that the detective showed up.  And what made you know he was faking?  We didn't know until, like, the cops checked it out.  We had camera crews all over the place.  It was going to be, it was about to break to become a huge story.  And then I guess the detectives found the guy and went to his house.  Realized he was just a lunatic.  And I guess the guy answered the door in his underwear and basically the detectives were  like, this guy couldn't do shit. 
[00:14:30]  They just knew.  They had stories of Colombian drug dealers that he was killing in warehouses, setting  their bodies on fire and just leaving a burning pile of ash there.  He was very believable.  And he was calling for your help?  Pretty good.  No, he was just kind of bragging.  Well, no.  Stalker Patty needed a place to live.  Oh, right.  And he was opening up his house to him.  And he called, said, I'll take Stalker Patty in, and then we just started asking him.  We wanted to know his background, see if she was safe, and his background turned out a  little wacky.  So the camera crews and everything, they were all set up and ready to go, and then they 
[00:15:00]  got the word that this guy was just a lunatic, and then they all just packed up their equipment  and went home.  Yep.  The calls that, you know, sometimes I come in and the calls, like, you know, the truckers  from, there's a lot of truckers, man.  Yeah.  And every time I watch those Discovery Channel things or investigative reports.  He was a trucker driving a lonely road where he picked up a hitchhiker, and you're like,  ah.  Large margin.  There it is.  Just dumps our body in this shallow grave.  Hey, this is Crazy Raccoon in 10-4-8. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Where you at?  Oh, I'm in the middle of Arizona, man.  Hair fibers were found in the sleeper compartment of his truck.  You know there's a few of them listening.  It's amazing when they do.  And, you know, the XM thing, which is great, because it's like, they're driving all across  country.  Yeah, the truckers are driving across country, and they, you know, it used to be a pain in  the ass for them, changing stations every few miles.  Now they could just, you know, pop this on or anything else.  They like music and just listen to coast to coast.  Oh, they're keeping this whole thing alive, man.  There's some mad truckers out there, right? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  The truckers are keeping this whole satellite radio thing alive.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  And then it's growing from there, obviously, but the truckers are paying all the bills right  now.  Yeah, it's amazing, man.  I like that.  So, speaking of XM really fast, a lot of people have figured out why we've been talking to  the Apprentice people.  Oh, they saw that.  I read that on the message, but it's like, oh, now we see why the Apprentice was on the  show.  I was giving hints.  Were you?  Yeah, I was saying.  Your hints stink, though.  They turn into conspiracy posts. 
[00:16:30]  I was giving hints going, oh, God, we got to talk to this guy.  Oh, God, I got to watch the show tonight.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Anyway, XM Satellite Radio takes center stage on Donald Trump's The Apprentice on NBC Thursday,  a week from tonight, at 9 p.m.  9 p.m.  Eric Logan featured all over.  Elo.  Our own Elo is going to be on The Apprentice.  Next Thursday.  Maybe.  Celebrity.  Maybe he could call the show today and give us a little tease on what it's all about.  Maybe that's why he didn't answer my phone call last night. 
[00:17:00]  You called Elo?  When you call Elo, how long before you get an Elo return phone call?  Seconds?  Yeah.  I called Elo, still waiting on an Elo phone call.  Nothing.  Nothing from Elo.  I went through Don Wicklin, and nothing against Wicklin, but I had to go over Wiki's head.  About what?  I got to go over Wiki's head.  The whole Victoria's Secret thing?  No, no.  I could give a flying fuck about that.  That was just something. 
[00:17:30]  We were told we were going to the Victoria's Secret thing.  Fashion show.  Fashion show last night.  You know, one of these celebrity things where you sit down and watch these whores parade  up and down the runway, and it's hot, and then the press is there, so you get a little  boost and stuff.  It's the only reason any of the celebrities ever go to these things.  It's a publicity thing.  I don't know.  It's Victoria's Secret, though, too.  Well, that's good.  Yeah.  And we wanted to go, and we had an invite right up until we were supposed to.  We never had an invite.  Yeah, we never had an invite.  We realized we never had an invite right up until, like, we were supposed to go, and 
[00:18:00]  then, oh, you're not going.  And I just wrote an email back to Wicklin.  It was two simple words.  Fuck everyone.  That's what I wrote back to Don Wicklin.  That was my email back to Wicklin, of which, thank you, Don.  I got a phone call from Don.  But I left a message with Elo.  I know that we are partnered with a wonderful corporation called General Motors, Opie. 
[00:18:30]  That's right.  General Motors.  Oh, I know where you're going with this.  Yes, you know where we're going.  We've heard.  But not in my SRX.  We're going nowhere in that.  We found your door yesterday.  No, you didn't.  We didn't get to that call.  Go ahead.  And absolutely, no, we didn't.  I don't want a door off a 2004 dented up frigging green door on my blue thing.  It's a 2005 SRX.  More entitlement here.  Yes.  More angry entitlement.  I'm getting into entitlement mode.  I got to listen to Andrew. 
[00:19:00]  I need a new door.  What's wrong with his?  Now, I got a Caddy SRX for my girlfriend.  She drives it.  So she's in the parking lot of one of these stores over there in Great Neck.  And some JuBroad and Lexus is coming out of one of the aisles.  And a Lexus.  And hits the door of the SRX.  Jesus.  Nothing big, but it dents the door so you can't even open the door anymore.  Okay.  Needs a new driver's side door. 
[00:19:30]  A new one?  They can't get somebody to undent it?  Undent.  This is a 2005 vehicle.  New fucking door.  Just undent.  And there is no undenting.  It's curled.  The hinges are fucked.  I mean, it was hit in a perfect spot to fuck the door up.  There is undenting.  We have to filter out entitlement.  No.  When you drive around, you drive around uptown, and some Puerto Rican jumps out and goes,  you want me to take that dent out for you?  That's undenting.  I've had that happen before.  I had a pathfinder with a dent in the back.  And the guy's like, out of nowhere, I'm driving uptown. 
[00:20:00]  He goes, Anthony, you want that dent taken out?  No.  Anthony now lives as a fancy man.  He really does.  He lived in the trenches for many years.  He ain't dealing with undenting anymore, Patrice.  Here's the deal.  I don't want undenting.  I don't want a used door.  A new door is as much as a car.  Insurance company pays for it.  He doesn't give a fuck, Patrice.  The insurance is paying for this.  They already wrote a check.  I have a check from Geico that is sitting on my desk at home.  Yes, desk at home. 
[00:20:30]  Wait a minute.  Now, here's the difference.  Now, here's a perfect example of when you get entitled, how you miss out on other people's  situations, the fact is that this Jew broad hit the car and stayed to exchange information  so that Geico could pay.  Do you know what happens?  It's a fucking great night.  If someone dents my car door, I get it undented.  Do you know why?  Because I don't know who did it.  They just...  They left.  Or they shot me and said, don't you fucking open your mouth about this door, and they 
[00:21:00]  leave.  So I got to pay for my undented door.  A new door is something I would never even think of.  There's two worlds out there, Patrice.  Two worlds.  This is a two...  How about a door that's a different color?  Would you go that route?  I don't...  This is a 2005 caddy.  So what does Elo have to do with this?  All right.  Here's where I'm going with it.  He's like a very busy man.  Here's where I'm going with it.  And now it looks like he's going to be a TV star. 
[00:21:30]  Busy man.  Well, let me tell you something, busy man.  I'm going up top.  I'm going to the top.  Is this Eric Logan?  Si, senor.  Or is this the actor that plays Eric Logan?  Yeah, really.  I'm just on the stunt double.  Elo, my good friend.  Anthony, I...  Listen, I first...  I did get your message out.  I apologize.  I was going to call you today.  If I would have known it had to do with the door, my God, I would have...  I would have absolutely called you.  I think he's being sarcastic.  No, I'm being serious. 
[00:22:00]  I know people.  That's what I figured.  I know Elo is a power guy.  He knows...  If there's a partnership between XM and General Motors, Elo knows people at General Motors  that can go to Detroit, stop the assembly line.  They pull that cord when someone gets their arm caught in the assembly line.  They...  And work stops, and they will walk up, grab a door that is bound for an SRX, and mail  it to me.  That's the power I know of Elo. 
[00:22:30]  I need a door.  You know what I find funny about this whole thing, that it took a personal problem for  Anthony to call our big boss.  To finally call...  I leave him alone because he's a busy man.  Holy crap.  Like you said.  He's a busy man.  Am I the only one obsessing about this radio show on a daily basis?  Here's the problem.  It's a personal problem for him to get a hold of the boss.  Here's the problem I had.  He runs...  This guy runs XM?  Yeah.  The boss of XM, this guy?  Elo.  Pretty much, yeah.  He has a...  He wields a fucking samurai sword.  So he has these connections at XM and Ford or whatever? 
[00:23:00]  GM and XM have a relationship together.  They're in business together with the XM satellite radio going into the General Motors cars right  on the assembly line.  It's a beautiful thing.  And I love my car.  I love my XM in my vehicle.  It's wonderful.  Wait, so you're saying he should just go in and like go, hey, Lee.  As in Lee Iacocca.  Yeah, well, that's Dodge.  Hey, look, Dodge.  I don't know who that is.  Oh, please go.  Way to go, Patrice.  You'll be hired by XM tomorrow. 
[00:23:30]  What are you going to do?  I don't...  What the fuck do I do?  I don't know who the boss is either.  If I did, I'd have called him.  What white businessman runs for what I'm asking who Elo is?  The only reason I called Elo, the only reason I called Elo is because my day yesterday was  like Roger and me.  I was searching.  I swear to God, I was that frustrated.  I was searching for a top dog.  I called...  First, I called my collision place that Geico sent me to.  Yeah.  And they said there are no doors anywhere for this vehicle. 
[00:24:00]  No doors.  Because they're not going to make a door without the car.  It doesn't exist because they...  For parts.  They undent.  Door is not a part.  Not on a brand new vehicle.  You don't undent.  You get a new door.  A gasket is a part.  You know what a part is?  Something you can take out yourself.  You know one can remove a door.  I want a new goddamn door.  How long does it take to press out a door in Detroit?  You know who deals with doors?  Who?  Puerto Ricans, man.  People who you don't want to deal with.  I want a door that I know that the electronics are going to work. 
[00:24:30]  It's not like a door on an old friggin' Rambler.  There's electronic work in there.  You get a door without a dent, there could be 800 other things wrong with that door.  There's a mirror system on that door that has to work properly.  There's a cup holder.  There's things on that door that could be so screwed up unless it's a brand new door.  Just throw the car away.  I came close.  Just throw the car away.  Dude, Patrice, don't even laugh.  A week from now, we will find out that he threw the car away. 
[00:25:00]  Let me give you the timeline.  He threw away a perfectly good couch because some kid might have wiped a booger on the couch.  No, he did.  He wiped a booger on it.  And then what?  It might be bird flu on it?  Couldn't find a booger.  He couldn't find a booger.  And the thought of sitting on that couch, and that booger on that couch?  A child's booger?  Yeah.  A child's booger.  But that's like a child's pee.  It doesn't, it's like, it's not, it's not, it's not evil.  It's not evil.  It doesn't have the good stuff yet. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, it's disgusting.  A man's boogie is different, but a child's booger?  Dude, he couldn't find the booger, which means the couch was obviously fine.  That wasn't good enough for Anthony.  He threw the couch away.  Gone.  Are you serious, dude?  Out in Z.  A nice couch.  Actually, the guy that came to wall it away to the garbage actually took it.  Yeah, this isn't a fraternity behind those beautiful eyes, man.  I don't understand.  Anthony, why is he like this, man?  Opie?  He, I don't, I grew up, I, I, the situation I had, actually, one example is me and Opie 
[00:26:00]  went to an event for a radio station that we were working at.  We both pulled, drove there.  As we left the event, we stayed late to talk to people, so the parking lot was empty.  Anthony, when we came out, he actually thought the car that I had driven there in was an  abandoned car that was left in the woods of the parking lot.  I had to park, like, on the periphery of the parking lot.  That was at Spooky World.  That was at Spooky World up in Massachusetts.  He got the last possible spot.  It was like kind of in the woods.  Kind of in the woods up on a slight hill.  He thought it was an abandoned, he goes, what are you walking toward there? 
[00:26:30]  Don't go there.  It might be dangerous.  Oh, my God.  You missed somebody dead in that car.  Right.  It was my car.  That was my car.  That was my car.  So Anthony has come a long way, and he's a fancy person now, and I guarantee he'll just  throw the car away.  No, and if I could continue with my timeline of events of yesterday, you will see I came  close to throwing the car away.  So what you're going to do, you're going to undent it and then get rid of it?  No, I was just going to throw it away.  No, he's going to throw the car away.  At the place I bought it, though, which I also called. 
[00:27:00]  First, I called the collision place.  They say there's no doors anywhere.  They go, you've got to call Caddy Customer Service.  Okay, I call Caddy Customer Service.  They go, you've got to call a dealer.  I call a dealer.  The dealer then sends me to the parts department, which then calls everywhere.  They have, like, the computer system for everywhere.  And I hear the guy going, oh, boy.  Oh, no.  He's piping just, oh, brother.  He goes, I checked everywhere.  He goes, I checked even Mexico.  He goes, there are no doors to this vehicle available anywhere. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, this is Jim from this, we're at 146 over here in New York.  Is there, you guys got a door?  You need, we need a blue Caddy door.  No doors available.  No doors.  I call up, and they have me calling.  And he goes, you know what?  I got two that came up on my computer.  One's in Alabama.  Another one is in Ohio.  Here are the numbers.  Call them.  So now I'm on the phone with some hillbilly going, we got a door, but it's damaged up pretty bad. 
[00:28:00]  I go, all right, thank you.  Same thing with the other place I called.  Damaged door.  They just got a door that's just like your door.  They just found a door, yeah, just like my door.  Because you know why, Anthony?  There's probably some poor son of a bitch in California called for my door.  Because it's the only time a door goes into the system is when there's damage, and someone's looking for a door.  So what they have is some asshole in Ohio is looking for a door.  Because some Jew broad hits my car, I got to now have an old door. 
[00:28:30]  Undented!  No, undented is old, damaged door.  I want brand new doors.  Brand new car, brand new door.  Just, just, just.  So now I'm fuming.  Don't even bother.  Now I'm fuming, fuming.  So now I call the place I bought the car at, in Jersey.  And I go to talk to my guy there, and he's gone.  Because car dealers are like those guys in the old days with the covered wagons and the elixirs.  They're, this one is wonderful.  It cures baldness and everything.  And then you try to find him two seconds later.  Oh, he's gone. 
[00:29:00]  That guy's gone.  Car salesmen are scum of the earth, by the way.  Just want to say that.  Well, can he do something?  Can, can Elo do something?  Well, I mean, I hadn't even gotten to the Elo point yet.  So I call up the car dealership, and I call the head general sales manager, who's still there.  And the woman goes, he's on vacation.  He'll be back in two weeks.  I go, and then I start getting mad.  I go, I go, okay, when he left, when Michael left, who did he tap on the shoulder and say,  you're in charge, because that's who I want to talk to right now. 
[00:29:30]  She goes, well, I need to know your problem.  So I explain the problem to her.  She goes, you have to talk to parts first.  I go, I don't want to talk to parts.  They don't have my part.  She goes, but if you talk to parts, then you can talk to the other guy.  I go, because, and here's where I said I'm going to throw the car away.  I go, because if this doesn't get resolved, I am driving this vehicle to your dealership  at Jersey, dropping this piece of shit off at the front door, and you could deal with it.  I'll stop making payments.  When they say, why aren't you paying? 
[00:30:00]  I said, I gave it back.  I gave it fucking back.  I'm buying a goddamn Porsche Cayenne.  You go fuck yourself with your SRX.  I need a fucking door.  And again, the big run around the parts guy, again, with the, oof, making noises into the  phone as he types, finally told me, call up your collision place.  Sent me in a big circle.  I said, I called him already.  It was over.  I hung the phone up.  I threw the phone.  Said, motherfuckers.  And then I go, you know, ELO.  Let me call ELO. 
[00:30:30]  ELO.  Relationship with General Motors.  Perhaps someone on the inside can get me a door.  How many times have you called ELO before this?  I can answer that one.  Oh, no.  Probably never.  This is the problem.  I've never called ELO.  At least, here's what you should have done.  Call him four times before the door.  You guys see it the wrong way.  You guys see it as I'm only calling because I need something.  I see it as, I see ELO as being so busy, I will look at other ways of solving a problem.  That's some pimps. 
[00:31:00]  That's some pimps.  I am looking at other ways to solve.  We've solved problems before without having to drag ELO in.  We'll do it later.  But this problem reached the point, and I tried, reached the point where I now have  to go to the power broker, the guy that has relationships with higher ups at General  Motors, Eric Logan, to help me out getting a door.  Now, ELO, can you get yourself a door?  You know, I can, actually.  And that's why I don't think there's any doors left, because it's sort of like, you  know, how you have extra CDs or record companies?  They have extra doors in General Motors. 
[00:31:30]  They're just laying around.  ELO, there's got to be a way that someone could just snatch one off the line.  The big assembly line.  I don't see why, I don't see this to be a problem.  You don't?  I don't.  I mean, it's a door.  I love this man.  People have problems.  People go to stores.  I need a door.  I need a new engine.  But I've been through, like, I've been through the whole thing where I went through every  avenue to try to get a door.  And they say there just aren't any of the, what they call, back-ordered.  So there's a whole bunch of people, I guess, waiting for a door. 
[00:32:00]  That's what the problem is.  If something's back-ed, it means you're in the wrong place in the line to get the door.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  I need to get up in the queue a bit further.  I need to be at the front of the door line.  I'll be mother- I wish I could call a white man and get me a door.  To even think.  To even think to do that, man.  I'm just getting a PBA card.  This is what-  My career-  PBA.  My career is getting me.  That's so 1995.  Exactly.  They rip PBA cards. 
[00:32:30]  He walks around with a police plaque.  Elo on his car.  With a cop on his head.  Is there any way through your relationship with General Motors that maybe my spot in the  line could be moved up a little further to help?  Because I love to get on and talk well about General Motors and the vehicles that I bought.  I have two General Motors vehicles, two Cadillacs.  I have my Escalade, which I'm very happy with.  I love it.  I love the XM unit in there, the way it's integrated into the whole navigation system.  I love it. 
[00:33:00]  And then-  Oh, XM comes with-  Yes.  The whole thing now.  And the SRX, the same thing.  It's a great vehicle.  I got a Z70.  I got a Suburban.  I didn't get built in XM.  I got a 2004.  2004.  2004.  You got to get something that's dated after 1985.  After-  I got a 2004 Z71.  2004.  You need a 2005.  Well, you need to call Elo.  You got to upgrade.  Hey, Elo.  Yeah, there you go.  We get an XM.  Click.  Click. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, what happened to Elo?  He's gone.  Eric, I would be indebted to you.  All I want is a little old radio.  I don't want no goddamn door.  Who's the president?  No.  Who's the president of General Motors these days?  I don't even know.  The chairman is a guy named Rick Wagner.  Rick Wagner.  Yeah.  I love the guy.  Rick Wagner, please, if I could just get a door.  I really need this door.  Yeah.  And I need a windshield wiper.  I'm going to make this a priority.  I'm going to work on this door this morning.  I'm actually going to work on this door before the end of the show. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you so much.  It is the front driver's side door.  Of a 2005 SRX.  2005, blue chip is the color, SRX.  Blue chip SRX.  Got it.  Yes.  Eric, thank you so very much.  We've got to talk to Eric about The Apprentice, too.  That's happening next Thursday.  Anthony, do you want me to focus on The Apprentice or your door?  Right now, The Apprentice, because you're the star here.  Oh, please.  I did not focus on the radio, so. 
[00:34:30]  Huh?  Just while I'm mad, I'm going to grab you a radio when I just go up and get back.  People are calling me a door diva.  How can I be a door diva?  Yes, man.  I cannot believe I'm watching this, man.  New door.  You know, I love how we can open up windows to each other's world, Patrice.  You have shown me things.  That night at the Halloween party when we talked about relationships, and you were talking about  your girl, and I had no comprehension of how you treat your woman, how she treats you, 
[00:35:00]  the relationship there.  It was a window to a world I have no clue about.  And this now is opening up a little of the white man to you.  I would never think, even if I had a friend that knew how to get doors, I wouldn't go,  let me call my man.  He can get my door and shit.  I would go, damn, where can I go to get this goddamn door fixed and this dent out of it  without them smashing up inside or stealing something on my car?  New door.  Oh, new door.  Because I look in where they put the doors.  There's a lot of springs.  There's all types of buttons. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, gadgetry.  And I go, this can't come off.  Why would I even think about taking this shit off?  There are people that know where every piece goes, Patrice.  They take it off, and it's not even like they have spare parts left over.  When did you think to get a door?  Like, when did you think that you would get a new door?  The second I got the call that the door was hit, it was in my head, new door.  New door.  Not used door.  New door.  Not collision door.  The shittiest car that someone's scared to get in to, like, there's process in life.  The first car I got after my piece of crap was a, uh, uh, uh, what did I have? 
[00:36:00]  A Cougar.  Oh, that's right.  I had a Cougar.  A Black Cougar?  Black Cougar.  Tinted windows.  This thing.  And it was my first new vehicle I ever owned.  Oh, he pimped it up, too.  He pimped it out.  I, I, I loved this thing.  And since then, I've been a fancy driving man.  I need a fancy vehicle.  His first car, he just left on the side of the road.  Yeah, it, it blew up in Mamaronek, that one that looked abandoned, and I just got out  and left it there.  And rented a U-Haul, I think. 
[00:36:30]  And I still, yeah, I went to a U-Haul place, because I knew you could rent it for like 29  bucks one way, and just rented a U-Haul, drove that the rest of the way home, and left my  car there.  Isn't that illegal?  It's probably still in Mamaronek.  Well, it's probably, uh, not a good thing to do.  Yeah.  Because you have to, like, it was before I was fancy.  But how'd you learn how to get new doors?  He's like, how, I would not know to ask this.  It's just as your, your bank account goes up, you learn these things.  You just learn these things.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm still, I'm still at dented door level. 
[00:37:00]  Dented door.  Patrice, I hope, I pray for you that someday you will insist on a new door.  I'll call Elo.  Man, listen, do anybody I know?  I need somebody to help get a dinner.  I need a new door.  I know, this Puerto Rican, it works for XM.  Let's get, let's get back to Elo.  So, Elo, the Apprentice, next Thursday.  Yes, buddy.  You're the big star, huh?  I don't know if I'm the big star.  It's Donald's show.  There's really no star bigger than him, though.  And rumor has it that we might get Donald on our show.  I think, I think we're going to make that happen. 
[00:37:30]  I think you're going to get the Trumpster Thursday morning on your show.  Like 7, 10, 7, 15.  Whoa.  But a week from tonight, the Apprentice is all about XM.  And Eric Logan's one of the judges.  Lee Abrams down there in Washington.  Do you get to mouth off to anybody?  You know what, I mouthed off about some people to Lee because the goof up that happens, which  is actually a pretty big one, makes it really easy for us to make our decisions.  What was the big goof up?  Being in control of the Opie and Anthony marketing plan? 
[00:38:00]  No, it's a small goof up.  This is a big goof up, though.  This was a big, I can't, I'm still under an NDA, so I really can't disclose a lot of things.  All right, we just know that it's all about XM next Thursday on The Apprentice.  Yeah, it's great.  I mean, the two teams have to pick up, they have to pick out an artist, some artists, and  they have to write a song, they have to produce a song.  They have to pitch Lee and Lisa and I, and then we choose which one of these two records  based upon airplay on the air, because we actually did it on the air back in earlier 
[00:38:30]  this year, and callers called up and talked about the two songs, and then we make a choice  of which one it is, and whichever one gets added to the playlist wins, and then the other  team has to go to the boardroom.  That's very, very cool.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun, a lot of fun.  And XM Canada?  XM Canada, coming soon.  And we're part of the programming lineup?  I am staring at a channel lineup right now that says The Opie and Anthony Show.  Wow.  See?  This is a guy that gets things done. 
[00:39:00]  Eric Logan.  Absolutely.  Well, Eric Logan promised we'd have a bigger audience than Howard, and he's proven it on  a daily basis.  And you'll have it again.  Also, the DirecTV deal starts Monday, right?  Starts on the 15th, yeah.  So is that Monday or Tuesday?  Oh, it starts on the 15th.  We're going to be heard on DirecTV as well.  Any other big things going on with XM?  Tons of big things.  Tons of big things.  I'm working on...  Don't...  Not when I need to...  Eric? 
[00:39:30]  Eric?  By the way, that was Opie hanging up on you, not Anthony.  I have total faith in you, and I would never have hung up like that.  Respect.  What a scumbag.  He asks him a question.  He falls for every time.  And every time he answers, and every time you hang up.  He's such a scumbag.  In two weeks, we have a...  Click.  What the?  What? 
[00:40:00]  He's still talking, too.  Do you think he hangs up his phone very uncomfortably, or do you think he's just like,  ah, that's just what they do?  Yeah, he's asking guys, yeah.  If he listens to the show...  No, I think it's more of an uncomfortable thing.  Next phone call.  He does this.  He clearly...  Well, let's see what my next thing to do today is.  Next call, HP.  Let me just say that.  HP?  If this one doesn't go through, next call is to HP himself, you, Panera.  I'm going up, up, up, but I have total faith in Elo. 
[00:40:30]  Now, am I crazy, but didn't Lee Iacocca once run for it, or once run GM?  I think he worked many, many years before he picked up Dodge.  He worked for some other company.  I think he was in the mailroom of...  Yeah, like on the assembly line.  Or something, yeah.  I'm a line worker.  What?  Who is...  That's Blue, Anthony.  That's Blue?  That's one of the famous homeless guys.  From Homeless Shopping Springs?  Yeah, everyone knows Blue.  Yes, that is Big Blue.  Couldn't find Tippi Tom, could you? 
[00:41:00]  Not this morning.  Have you seen him lately?  I have.  Oh, you have?  Well, he was supposed to show up at the Halloween bash that we had,  and I kept reminding him every day for about three weeks,  and I saw him...  I'll be there!  I saw him the Saturday before it, and I says,  you know what Monday is, right?  And he says, yeah, Thanksgiving.  So, yeah.  A little problem keeping track of the holiday.  The homeless really don't care if it's a holiday.  It really doesn't mean much for them.  So, instead today, since we're working on homeless shopping again, 
[00:41:30]  I got Big Blue.  Big Blue.  Yeah, I think we're doing a homeless shopping spree this year.  Yes!  Pulling out one of the standards.  In like, what, three years?  Yeah.  Pulling out one of the standards.  Yeah, and like us, Big Blue was on a break as well.  He's been in prison for three and a half years.  What?  Oh, really?  Like the time we were off the air, he was in prison?  Don't even tell us for what.  We'll do a little interview with Big Blue after the break.  Is he very good hearing today?  Yeah, he's not bad.  All right.  All right.  What is he on today?  Because he's just booze.  Just booze.  What's he listening to? 
[00:42:00]  Slow jams.  Slow jams?  All right.  All right, cool.  We'll talk about that after the break.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bob in New York City.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, man.  Go ahead, Bob.  I got a deal for it.  I don't know why he keeps crying.  I got three matches.  Two of them in Brooklyn and one in Brooklyn.  Yeah, brand new?  Brand new.  They'll take them right off the truck and bring them right into you.  They got the mirrors, the cup holders, everything. 
[00:42:30]  There is the cup holders.  Do you need wheels?  He's got four beautiful chrome wheels with gold cap.  I don't need wheels.  All I need is a door.  We can get the door.  Now, what are you, legitimate or are you in Brooklyn just taking doors?  He gets them tonight.  Yeah.  He gets them tonight.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey, Nate.  Good morning, Black Jimmy.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  What's the matter with you?  You're pointing the white connections in front of a black guy?  Come on.  Yeah, we're kind of letting the secrets out. 
[00:43:00]  Seriously.  One more minute, Stephan.  Didn't I tell you that I have a Ph.D. in crackers?  You understand?  I grew up in Boston.  You're a ridiculous black Jimmy.  Ouch.  You asshole.  You don't hurt.  I've been white.  I have white.  You see my back, it looks like LeVon Burton from Roots.  And I'm still standing tall.  I know about white connections.  I just didn't know to order a door.  Now you know.  Jesus.  Now you know.  What's the upgrade from PBA? 
[00:43:30]  It's FOP, right?  Oh, yeah.  The fraternal order.  Yeah.  Sergeants.  Is that the upgrade?  I got to get that.  I got to get that.  Anthony drives around with a plaque.  I just don't want to, like, be entitled with my white connections.  Like, I need a door.  God damn it.  Give me a door.  I do.  You know, it sounds like I'm entitled or I feel I have this entitlement because I just come out on the air like that and say it.  But there was so much work that went on for a good three weeks that I did at home on the phone before this blow-up. 
[00:44:00]  I was trying my derndest.  You know, I would ask for a door if I knew a person to get me one.  I would go, if I knew you could get me a door in there, I'd go, I mean, I hope, I'd go, uh, you know, this sounds crazy.  Um, but I know.  I was hoping I could get a.  Damage.  I was hoping I could get a.  Do they have doors there?  Extra doors?  Let's say hi to Heather.  Heather.  Hey, is Anthony the door diva?  Door diva.  I need a door. 
[00:44:30]  Punch it out.  All right, very good.  Door diva.  What a.  I can't believe you.  They just kept running me around and around, though.  I'm making phone calls, and I figured Elo's the guy to go to.  All right, well.  Well, can you get the dent fixed and then look for the new door?  No.  At least he can drive it around.  No, he just wants a new door.  It's not a dent that, you know, you take the plunger and pull it out.  It's creased and curled by the hinge to the point where the door doesn't shut anymore.  It's that bad.  It's the door is done. 
[00:45:00]  Spent.  All right.  Enough about the door.  Enough about the moose.  Enough about the door.  Yeah.  Enough about the moose.  Very good.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  We've got to get to the Tyra Banks stuttering special today.  Yeah.  Also, man, you know, it's been sitting in front of us for a few days now.  The Dateline online predator thing.  Holy crap.  Did you see this show?  I did not see it.  I heard some clips.  Dateline rented a house in a really nice suburb, and then they did the online chat and got these predators. 
[00:45:30]  With some pedophiles posing as children.  They get the pedophiles, and then they invite them over the house.  And when they walk in, there's a Dateline camera crew asking them, hey, what's your problem, bud?  What the fuck are you doing here?  What are you doing trying to hook up with a young boy?  And instead of turning and running, they actually sit there and talk to the guy.  Well, they can't run because at that point, I guess because it's news, they're going to show the footage on TV.  You're not signing releases.  How about running, though?  Well, they're getting as little camera time as possible. 
[00:46:00]  I'll explain that.  They don't really say what it's for at first.  Is the camera hidden, or is it right in front of their face?  The reporter just kind of all of a sudden walks into the kitchen, and is like, hey, bud.  Hey, what are you doing?  Hey, bud.  Hey, bud.  What's your problem?  What are you doing here?  And then they talk for a while, get some info out of them, and then they explain what it's for.  And then they start running.  Freaking out a little bit.  But at that point, it's too late.  They got a rabbi.  Naked guy is the star of the show.  Naked guy.  Naked guy. 
[00:46:30]  I haven't heard about naked guy.  They convince this guy to come to the house with beer for a kid and get naked in the garage.  I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.  Oh, what an ass.  I've got to see the video.  So then they got video of the kitchen, and all of a sudden, naked guy walks into the kitchen.  And there's the reporter like, what the hell are you doing?  With the ball blur?  Yeah, it's a big blur out of pixelated nutsack.  With the pixelated balls.  And the reporter just disgusted, hands in a towel, looking away like, oh, cover yourself, and then we'll talk. 
[00:47:00]  But not only was he naked, he was naked for a child.  Yeah, for a kid with beer.  That's the highlight, right, Nathaniel?  Screw the rest of it.  We can play it right now, all right?  Yeah, let's hear.  Man told to come in naked.  And what do they use, chicks for the voice of the young boys or something?  Yeah, they actually used a chick that sounded kind of like a little kid, I guess.  The girl who plays Bart Simpson?  It's never a child, people. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know who's still getting caught.  Who is still getting caught?  They're the same people that are, like, sending their bank accounts numbers to Nigeria?  Yeah.  Because there's a fortune there that has to be sent over to the U.S.?  My roommate almost got caught up in that.  Stop it.  Yeah, and sent a sexy picture, a Nigerian girl.  Hey, they kidnapped me, and they said I have to stay at this hotel until I get $4,612.  Sorry.  You're going to be there a while.  You know, I think we should go through this whole thing.  Yeah, most of these are pretty good.  Yeah, this is a really good thing. 
[00:48:00]  And then there's a little twist and a surprise as far as the naked guy goes.  Ooh.  You guys didn't see the show?  All right, I'll keep it at that.  You won't believe what happens to the naked guy at the end of this thing.  Here's the first clip.  We enlisted the help of volunteers from a vigilante organization called Perverted Justice.  Volunteers of this controversial group are experts at pretending to be children online in order to catch and expose potential predators.  And in most states, soliciting a minor for sex is still a crime, even if it turns out the minor is really an adult posing as a child. 
[00:48:30]  You have to stop at the bank first.  While some in law enforcement strongly oppose any civilian group conducting sting operations,  Perverted Justice volunteers say they are often able to provide authorities, from local police to the FBI, evidence to build cases and get convictions.  Let's go to Guido real fast in Philly.  Guido.  Oh, yo.  Yo, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Guido.  See, the Egyptian guys wanted to buy the house. 
[00:49:00]  A 13-year-old's going to sell them the house.  Yeah, they all come up with some crazy excuses why they're there.  And, you know, the reporter or whatever from Dateline is like, no, we got the transcript.  You weren't coming here to buy the house.  You weren't coming here to do this.  You were coming here because you thought you were going to have sex with an underage boy.  No one's there for a kid touching sex.  The thing was hilarious to watch.  I hate to admit.  But that's the thing.  It's like, okay, just one little psychological thing.  It's like they said the little girl supposedly, this supposed little girl or little boy goes, 
[00:49:30]  come on over to my house.  Sure, I'm going to come on over to your house, little boy.  Your house?  Not a meeting at Inspiration Point or Al's Diner or something, but at your house?  Yeah.  Like what?  My mommy's not home?  How do you end up doing that?  Yeah.  Like that's the thing where you call you stupid?  Dude, they're so sexed up into a froth.  They're like, rrrr.  They're just, it's just, they're pumping. 
[00:50:00]  Just the thought that they are going there to have some sex with a kid is, all logic goes  out of their head.  Oh my God.  They lose their minds.  Yeah.  Come on in.  Sit down.  Have a little, uh, I have some toy cup tea and some, oh, yes, of course.  And I have, uh, what's the, what's the, the easy bake oven cookies?  Have a seat, make it, man.  Here we go.  Here's the next clip.  So how do perverted justice operatives find potential sexual predators? 
[00:50:30]  First, they go into chat rooms, usually through AOL or Yahoo, and set up a profile of a 12,  13, or 14-year-old.  A profile that often includes a photo of a child obviously underage, like this one provided  by the girl's mother.  Then the decoys wait to be contacted by an adult.  In order to avoid the appearance of entrapment, they never make the first contact.  But once a chat begins, the undercover operatives make it known they're open to the possibility  of sex.  A few decoys even seem eager. 
[00:51:00]  How quickly do these conversations turn sexual?  Sometimes, uh, very quickly.  As soon as the conversation is, hi, my name is, I'm 14 years old or 13 years old, and the  gentleman will then say, look at this, and send you a picture or say something else.  And that's, that would be the crime right there.  I just can't wait.  Look at, uh, hi, how old are you?  14, here's my cock.  Picture my cock.  Not even like a fine how do you do or anything. 
[00:51:30]  Like no tat, even for the kids.  It's like even a little kid would go, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey there, fella.  Dude.  I just got home from school.  Yeah, just, you gonna get some?  You gonna get some?  Calm down.  Let's kiss for, damn, excited?  Just got home from school.  I'm 14 years old.  Can I put it in your ass?  What?  What?  He's eternal.  Geez, what classes you taking? 
[00:52:00]  I thought older men was supposed to be cool.  Yeah.  Get out of here, man.  Be a little smooth.  That is so great, I know.  Right to it, man.  Damn!  And then the guy has pedophile voice.  The guy doing the thing, it's like, he has that look.  Yeah, creepy voice.  Well, now we get into some of the audio of the pedophiles.  Listen to this.  Here's a 46-year-old who calls himself the Sphinx 59.  Yeah.  He thinks he's talking to a 12-year-old girl named Sarah. 
[00:52:30]  It takes him only four minutes of chatting online to ask her, are you a virgin?  She says she is.  And then he asks if she's ever performed oral sex.  In this chat, as in many other men's chats, things get much more graphic and disgusting.  As soon as those boundaries are crossed in a lot of ways, the chat tends to get a lot more explicit very quickly.  This man, VA male 69, 2005, who's 28, thinks he's talking to Aaron, a 14-year-old. 
[00:53:00]  He asks her bra size if she shaves anything other than her legs and says there's just something about a teen body.  I'm 14, my name is Aaron, and I'm a cheerleader.  You shave your pussy?  Shave that snatch.  My girl, my girl is a hoe, and I still have to talk to her, like, a little bit.  Like, I have to go, I have to go, hey, babe, what you doing later?  These guys are fucking, I can't even say that to my girl. 
[00:53:30]  My name is Kathy, and I like puppy dogs, and I'm a virgin.  You suck cock.  Suck that cock.  Jesus, what happened to me?  I meant to type in, oh, nice to meet you, and what school do you go to, and I don't know.  My name is Brittany, and I'm only 12 years old, and I like pop music.  Lick your ass!  You need an ass licking? 
[00:54:00]  Love licking to your ass.  How about just, you know, why, you like Barbie?  Yeah, something.  Right to it.  Think kids cute, think king dolls are cute.  Yeah, suck that cock.  Oh, my God.  So at this point, they got the house that they rent, and they got the cameras ready to go,  and now these guys are starting to show up at the house convinced that they're going to meet some underage boy or girl.  Once a predator has made it clear he wants sex with a minor and makes a date for the liaison, 
[00:54:30]  the crime has already been committed.  Wow.  He doesn't even have to show up, but will he?  Hello?  Knock, knock.  The answer is yes.  Knock, knock.  But this man, once he sees me and not a teen, realizes he's made a big mistake and runs for the door.  Hey, how are you?  Uh, just come on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hey, you're not going to want to do that, I don't think.  Here's another guy who doesn't stay long.  Hey, how are you?  Good, I'm good.  Good, why don't you have a seat right over here? 
[00:55:00]  No, thank you.  I'd like to ask you some questions.  He makes a beeline out to the garage, barely touches the stairs,  and with his arms flailing, runs down the driveway and down the street.  Clearly.  Just run away.  Ah!  How quick did his rod go away when the dateline guy, like, pokes his face and boop.  Oh.  Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.  You got to have a guy with balls that stands there and go, is your daughter home?  That's who I was talking to. 
[00:55:30]  They should have a midget standing there, like, with the back turn, like, uh, like,  Sylvester Stallone from that movie.  What's that?  Ah, Nighthawks.  Nighthawks.  And just turn around and go, what the fuck is wrong with you?  Hey, you sicko.  You know, what the?  Yeah, a little blonde-haired midget.  Like the one from fucking Total Recall.  And then the camera just does a, does a close-up back-up look.  Nah, nah.  Leaves a silhouette of him with his arms flailing on the front door.  He ran through it like a cartoon. 
[00:56:00]  And he runs through it like Donald Duck.  There he dug in the shape of...  You see his arms, legs, and his boner.  In the shape of a pedophile in the house.  Him and his shadow.  Yeah, him and his shadow.  He's one, too.  Wow.  A little bit of curly smoke follows him.  Oh.  Oh, my God, man.  Still into it there, big boy?  We got Tom on Long Island.  Tom. 
[00:56:30]  Hey, guys.  Anybody pick up how much this guy sounds like Casey Kasem?  Yeah, he does sound a little like Casey Kasem.  I'm coming in at number five, a 12-year-old.  He does really...  The guy's good.  The Dateline guy is creepy.  Yeah.  Here we go.  The rest of that clip.  Clearly, this man knows he's done something wrong.  So does this guy.  I'm sorry.  See, this is all my stuff.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I want to talk to you for a minute.  No, I'm sorry.  No, I want to talk to you.  No, I'm sorry.  He also makes a run for it. 
[00:57:00]  But he didn't come in a car.  So he keeps running and running.  Presumably back to a bus station, lying desperately to hide his face.  It may look funny, but what these men had in mind based on their internet chats was anything but.  Most of the online conversations were so explicit, we can't even begin to show you.  Oh, really?  That last guy is really funny because he's running away.  And so Dateline hops in a van and starts following him.  Oh, no.  And then he just busts out an umbrella and holds it over his head while he's sprinting away. 
[00:57:30]  So they didn't commit a crime by just showing up?  They did.  They already committed the crime.  Well, Dateline's not a law enforcement agency.  And this other company, or not company, but these people that have this website, what  is it called?  Perverted Justice.  Perverted Justice.  They do this.  They don't have any jurisdiction or, you know, legally they can't arrest the guy, I guess.  So no cop was available just to.  No, I guess they didn't.  At least a cop to sit down and to say, look, dude, I can arrest you.  Oh, I'm sure they're going to be, you know, looking for these guys. 
[00:58:00]  Plus their lives are just ruined.  Yeah, their lives are wrecked.  This is on Dateline.  Imagine going back to work after this.  I saw you on TV.  Hey.  I was joking.  Yeah, it was a joke.  I knew Dateline was there.  Here's the guy that tried to get out of it by saying he was buying the house or something.  Buying the house.  From a 13-year-old boy.  I don't know.  Let's listen in.  How's it going?  How are you, sir?  I'm good.  Why don't you have a seat?  Thank you, sir.  Nice to meet you.  What are you doing here?  His name is Aladdin.  He lied online about his age, saying he was 35. 
[00:58:30]  He's really 46.  And instead of admitting he came here for a date with a 12-year-old girl, he says he's here to look at real estate.  Later, he decides to come clean.  Why did you really come here?  To see what's her name?  Sarah.  Sarah.  Sarah.  And you were talking with Sarah online?  Yes.  So all that other stuff in the house and all that, that was all a big, fat lie?  Yes.  Okay.  Do you know how old Sarah is? 
[00:59:00]  No.  He tries to convince me that the girl, Sarah, is 18, even though his own words tell a different story.  You say you're 35, male, and you say where you're from.  She says she's 12.  You say, oh, you're real young.  You like older men?  Depends, I guess.  You ask her about her former boyfriends.  Did she ever give them oral sex?  She says yes.  She tells you here that she's 12 years old.  What is that number right there?  What does that say? 
[00:59:30]  12.  12, yeah.  I'm dyslexic.  Dyslexic.  So that's the 18 thing in the lie as well.  21?  21.  Then, Aladdin apparently begins to feel faint.  What are you doing?  And lies down on the kitchen floor.  Are you okay?  Yes.  Can you want your water?  Can you see me?  Of course he felt faint.  That nigga was looking for that genie.  Yeah.  He's not rubbing his dick three times.  Oh, genie, where you at, nigga?  I got it.  Where's my flying compass? 
[01:00:00]  Take me away.  A shining shining shining.  Only 12 years old.  I am Aladdin.  I think his name was Aladdin.  Aladdin.  You know that wasn't his real name.  Oh, stop. 
[01:00:30]  You're a kid toucher.  You're a kid toucher.  You're a filthy whore.  You're an idiot.  Sweet.  You can get a doggy style.  You can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  My house and I get the same.  You're a kid toucher.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock. 
[01:01:00]  The last time I'm going to ask you.  You're a filthy whore.  Show me with your mouth.  Show me with your mouth.  Georgia.  That's Georgia.  I'm a goddamn rich cunt.  Liar whore.  Liar whore.  Liar whore.  You know it.  Here I am.  Let's go.  You will be molested. 
[01:01:30]  Oh dear.  Oh dear.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Sid, I can smell your cunt.  Oh my God. 
[01:02:00]  Do you want to kiss me or...  You'll blow it.  Let me kiss you on the world.  We've changed for nothing.  Don't love me or me.  Don't love me or me.  Don't love me or me.  Don't love me or me.  Stupid.  You're so stupid.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  You're a little bitch. 
[01:02:30]  That's right.  You're a bitch.  And I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  You blew it.  You use your tongue hurtier than a $20 whore.  Oh my body rocks.  Hey everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  We're in the hole.  I'm rising in my dream.  Holy beast.  You savage.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  I'm trying to spare. 
[01:03:00]  It's time to spare.  You gotta love this satellite radio, huh, Patrice?  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  No.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo. 
[01:03:30]  Oh my God.  Thank you.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hello, cutie pie.  Stop whining.  who is your daddy  and what does he do? 
[01:04:00]  Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.  This can't be happening, man.  This ain't happening.  And they mostly come at night.  Mostly.  Fucking Aladdin.  He gets fainted.  That was all in his head.  Poor Aladdin.  Poor Aladdin.  Oh, man. 
[01:04:30]  He couldn't wait to show off with that name.  Of course, it's me.  Is that your real name?  Another man, 56-year-old Simba,  came in.  Of course he did.  Hakuna, who the fuck are you?  Means no worries  for the rep.  Who the fuck?  Dateline.  Hakuna. 
[01:05:00]  Hakuna.  Who the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  We're at the 12-year-old.  Hakuna.  No worries.  Hakuna.  He's at the door.  Ain't no cash at ease.  He's going to be great.  No worries.  Slipping a fucking coin.  Looks like a zoot suit.  He's spinning his watch, flipping a coin down the street.  Get me a 12-year-old tonight.  Walking like the frog. 
[01:05:30]  Hello, my baby.  Hello, why don't you take a seat here and talk to us for a while.  What the fuck?  Who the?  Who the?  Hakuna Matata might mean no worries, but I'm fucked.  I got a lot of worries.  For the rest of your days.  He's spinning his top hat.  The philosopher the fucking.  Who the? 
[01:06:00]  Wet thumb in the corner of his eye.  Oh, yeah.  What the?  Looking at himself in the reflection and the knock around the door.  Look for any boogers.  Kids don't like boogers.  Hakuna Matata.  Hakuna Matata.  It means not doing.  Hakuna Matata.  Hakuna Matata.  Hakuna Matata.  Hakuna Matata. 
[01:06:30]  Hakuna Matata.  It means I'm fucked.  Oh, shit.  Who number one?  My philosophy.  No.  Oh, my name is Simba.  Aladdin.  Aladdin.  Oh, that nigga couldn't wait to be sexy.  How you doing, baby?  If you rub something three times, oh, a genie won't pop out. 
[01:07:00]  Beauty and the creep.  Oh, my goodness.  Akunama.  Akunama what?  Akunama what the?  Wah, wah.  The date line.  You're saying good.  Henchman from Brooklyn on the instant feedback, was he looking for a lad in his bed?  Yeah, a lad in his bed. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Aladdin.  He did not come in.  And his name was Aladdin.  Wow.  Wouldn't it be funny if one of these sickos actually says while walking through the door,  Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Radio.  All right.  Let's go to the next clip from the Dateline Predator special.  Oh, there's more Predator.  Oh, Akunama.  You better just sit there for another half hour.  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Yeah, let's just go to the clip.  Meet VAMail692005. 
[01:08:00]  He's the one who said there's just something about a teen body.  He's 28 and thinks he's talking to a 14-year-old.  He chatted online for more than a week with our decoy and slowly introduced more and more depraved sexual requests.  He even says he wants to involve a dog.  Wow, come on.  Stop it.  It wants to involve a dog.  And when this guy comes in next, he twitches the entire time. 
[01:08:30]  He looks like he's trying to kiss something the whole time.  He's like furrowing his face and piercing his lips the entire time.  By the way, we still haven't gotten to Naked Guy.  I haven't left that hard in six months, and we still haven't gotten to Naked Guy with that little twist at the end of the show.  Here we go.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Why don't you have a seat right around that stool?  There's those guys.  What's happening?  I'm much.  What are you here for?  Just coming to talk to him.  Coming to talk to who? 
[01:09:00]  That's it.  Why are you so nervous?  That's it.  I just get nervous.  I was coming to talk to Aaron.  How old is he?  She didn't tell me.  Try again.  The lion, motherfucker.  I saw 14.  So you thought it was okay to come here to see a 14-year-old girl?  No, I didn't.  And you say, would you ever try anal?  Ouch, that's like it could hurt.  I'd have done right.  You have to be very gentle with that.  Quite a Romeo.  I'm a lonely guy. 
[01:09:30]  What can I say?  He's more than just a lonely guy.  We did a background check on VA Mail, and it turns out his real name is Joe Wunderler.  An army sergeant stationed at Fort Belvoir at the Intelligence and Security Command.  I've never done anything.  I'm trying to get help.  He was.  What are you doing to get help?  I'm seeing a psychiatrist right now.  Well, it doesn't look like it's working too well based upon all this.  I just started talking to him.  This gets pretty freaky here.  You talk about sex acts with a dog. 
[01:10:00]  It's one of the reasons why I'm trying to get help, because I've gotten into photos that I know weren't right.  I guess you're going to tell me next that this is the very first time you've done something like this.  Actually, it is.  I'm serious.  Sure he is.  Wow.  They all have the same thing.  It's the first time.  They don't know how old she is at first, and then they kind of fess up to it.  And they're also in therapy to deal with it.  Yeah, dealing with it.  All right, we've got a naked guy, but first, it's the rabbi. 
[01:10:30]  Oy!  They caught a rabbi, too.  It's 4 o'clock in the morning in an AOL chat room.  This 54-year-old man, screen-named Red BD, messages a 13-year-old boy named Conrad, saying,  I'm prowling for young men.  What he goes on to say in the pictures he sends are so graphic,  we had to carefully edit them before putting them on television.  These pictures, the one they could show, all you can see is his face,  and his entire mouth is blacked out. 
[01:11:00]  Really?  So I can't imagine what's going on there, that they had to black out the mouth only.  Dreadle, dreidel, dreidel, I'll shove it up your ass.  Dreadle.  They blocked his mouth out because he was saying such depraved?  No, it was the picture.  I can only assume there was something in his mouth that's not supposed to be there on TV.  Oh, no, is that it?  I can only assume, why else would you block out only the mouth?  Was it a curly Q, Jew?  No.  Did he look like a rabbi?  Was he in his rabbinical clothing? 
[01:11:30]  No, he was in his street clothes.  But he had that rabbi look.  Does he use the excuse he thought the kid needed a circumcision or something?  He was just there, I'm a moil.  I smell skin.  I don't like it.  I want it gone.  Part two of this.  And as you'll hear when we read from his chat log, it's clear Red BD knows what he's doing is wrong.  You're only 13?  Uh, yeah. 
[01:12:00]  That's rape.  Dude, I tell you that before.  Yes, I remember.  Oh, okay.  Just, you're so, so young.  I've never been with a young man like you, but I would like to.  I'd love to rub your penis like a mezuzah.  Mezuzah.  All right.  You know what?  Let's take a break and we'll continue with this because we're halfway done.  Halfway?  Like half?  Yeah, we got the naked guy next. 
[01:12:30]  Means no worries for the rest of your day.  We'll get right into naked guy after the break.  How's that sound?  Fantastic.  I want to know why Al-  I got the audio, by the way.  Why is Al-Qaeda or Al-Qaeda or whatever, what is it with Bali?  Did like some Al-Qaeda guy have like a bad vacation there or something?  I mean, what the fuck?  I thought it was like a vacation, like tiki, torches and shit.  I mean, like, what are you thinking? 
[01:13:00]  Like blow up Senor Frogs and fucking Cancun next?  There's some kind of huge terrorist activity down there, over there.  Just, I don't know why either.  There's a lot of Muslims is what it is.  A lot of Muslims down there.  Ramadan stars.  What's that, Derek?  Derek knows that?  No, it's supposed to be one of the, like, second largest Muslim nation or something.  Yeah, there's a lot of Muslims.  It's like the Muslim Hampton.  It's a vacation there.  Don't I love about this show?  If you have a mic in front of you, you could be an expert on something. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I like the Muslim Hampton.  I was like, Derek is an expert on it.  That's very high concentration of the Muslims down there.  I know, because I've been studying this for the last ten years.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to the horse fuck video.  Right.  I love about that Encyclopedia Britannica commercial from the 80s.  I was a kid doing a research report on space.  Yeah.  That fucking thing.  He knows a little bit about everything, too.  I listen to all the talk shows, and I watch the pundits on TV, and I'm like, what makes  him an expert?  Just because there's a camera on him? 
[01:14:00]  A microphone.  That's it.  A microphone.  Derek had confidence.  I don't know shit.  I don't know shit.  I don't know shit.  I know everything.  I know everything.  Right here.  I'm just an asshole again.  I'm just an asshole.  I don't know shit.  I don't know nothing.  Fucking Einstein.  Right here.  I'm Alvin Einstein.  I'm a confidence star cat.  Oh, let me crank this mic up.  Let me tell you what I know.  Pinius J. 
[01:14:30]  Whoopi.  Pinius J.  Whoopi.  The gross national product of Bali.  There are times we discuss shit, and I'll say something, and we don't know.  Mr. Whoopi.  We don't know.  Why are there so many terrorist events in Indonesia?  Don't open that closet.  Gee, Tennessee.  First, let me get out my globe, and I'll show you.  A lot of rag-headed animals seem to live down there, Tennessee.  They like blowing each other up.  Strapping bombs to themselves, and whoopi. 
[01:15:00]  High body count.  They can't stand the Christians.  Mr. Whoopi, you're the greatest.  Whoopi and I.  Listen to you.  Snap my pizza.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[01:16:00]  Good God, Drew Boogie.  Got to love that.  It's the Open Anthony program.  Patrice O'Neill in studio today. 
[01:16:30]  Are you promoting anything, Patrice?  Just hanging?  All right, he's just nodding away.  Yep, just hanging out, man.  And Patrice will be with us tomorrow as well.  Got to go right to the phones.  James from Georgia.  James, go ahead.  Hey, I was just wondering,  why the hell does Anthony know the whole Hakuna Matata song?  Sounds like he might be some kind of pedophile himself over there.  Oh, you.  Who doesn't know that?  A little strange because you don't have kids, Anthony.  No, I don't have kids.  You don't hang out with nephews or nieces or anything. 
[01:17:00]  Where you see these movies over and over and over again.  Hakuna Matata.  Be no word.  Hakuna Matata.  I don't know where I picked that up.  I go to Disney a lot, you know?  So that's kind of plays.  And then let's see what else.  You do know a little bit about everything, so.  Right.  That is a really famous song, though.  I know a lot of songs that I'm not a fan of anyway.  You know, Hakuna Matata is like in our social psyche there.  Yeah.  Who doesn't know that one?  But you knew a couple of the nuances, though, that only a big fan would know. 
[01:17:30]  I saw the Broadway production, too, so perhaps that's why.  Hakuna Matata.  Let's get back into this.  The Dateline online predator show they did recently.  Predator.  And Jay Leno.  Jay Leno brought it, man.  He brought it.  Jay Leno?  Well, he did a few jokes on this whole special.  Oh, he did.  And we just did the rabbi guy that got caught, right?  The rabbi that went to the house.  The rabbi guy got caught.  Did you hear about this?  Thinking he was going to meet a 12-year-old girl, right? 
[01:18:00]  I think this is what Jay Leno had to say about that.  This is such a creepy story.  I don't know if you saw on Dateline the other night.  They had this horrible point on online predators, like men who meet underage boys on the Internet.  Did you see any of this?  They set up a sting in a house where these creepy guys would show up expecting to meet a kid to have sex with.  One guy was a rabbi.  Imagine a rabbi posing as a priest.  How horrible.  That's pretty funny.  There he is. 
[01:18:30]  I didn't know it was going to be a priest joke, but I didn't see it going there.  That was pretty good.  And then I went to the letterman, and he was talking about how big the squirrels are in Central Park or something.  Anyway, let's get back into this thing.  We're up to Naked Guy, finally.  Finally?  Everyone knows the premise, right?  Basically, they rented a house in the suburbs.  They got these guys to actually come to the house thinking they're going to meet an underage girl or boy.  Mostly boys.  Oh, dear.  And this guy was the star of the show.  Let's go right to the clip. 
[01:19:00]  Here comes Special Guy 29.  Earlier online, he told our decoy, who was posing as a 14-year-old boy, that he's an 11th-grade English teacher.  Then he told the boy that he hates conduct, but he's safe.  Our decoy asks Special Guy 29 to bring beer and then throws in a request, a technique often used by law enforcement to illustrate intent.  He types, side garage is open.  Stripped your underwear and come in. 
[01:19:30]  I be in mine.  The man says, I don't...  Now, this is Dateline.  Who's fucking falling for this one?  Now, this is Dateline just having fun with their little stink operation.  Let's see how crazy we can get with this.  Sometimes used by law enforcement.  Law enforcement with a real good sense of humor.  Yeah, they just want...  Dude, let's try to get the guy naked so we can fucking arrest him.  He's naked.  What do you say, dude?  Right.  That is perfect.  But who is the fucking idiot that's actually getting undressed?  Again, whipped into a frenzy. 
[01:20:00]  Let's back up and see what happens here.  Side garage is open.  Stripped your underwear and come in.  I be in mine.  The man says, I don't wear underwear.  So the decoy says, then come in naked.  We never thought he'd really do it.  But we were wrong.  After casing our house, walking up and down the street,  here he comes with the beer.  And you can guess what he does in the garage.  He got naked in the garage. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  And you could never guess what he does in the garage.  Your feet on the ground and keep reaching for your cock.  And now a long-distance dedication.  About a man naked in a garage.  Naked in the garage.  It reads, dear Casey.  I'm a 12-year-old boy.  What a creep.  More naked guy.  Could you explain yourself? 
[01:21:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sure.  Go ahead and cover up.  Certainly.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  The man's name is John Kennelly.  He tells me he's 29 and a bus driver.  Then he changes it to a teacher.  What kind of conduct is this for a high school teacher?  No, sir.  I've never done this before.  So you just woke up this morning and said,  I'm going to get involved in an internet conversation with a 14-year-old boy. 
[01:21:30]  I'm going to go to his house, strip naked, and walk in with a 12-pack of beer.  No, sir.  What would have happened, John, if I wasn't here?  Come on.  Do you know that it's illegal to have a conversation on the internet with the intent to have sex with a minor?  Yes, sir.  He says he knows it's illegal, but it appears that's not enough to deter him.  Yes. 
[01:22:00]  There's the tease.  Did you know it's illegal?  Of course.  Who doesn't know that?  The guy's whipped up.  That's not the end of Naked Guy.  No?  Oh, no.  He looked like he was crying, was he?  Yeah, he was really freaked out that he got caught.  What do you think the legal, like, if there was no such thing as law and all this bullshit,  what do you think the age would be that, like, a regular dude would go, nah?  Oh, nah.  What, the cutoff point?  The cutoff, the primal cutoff point of nah. 
[01:22:30]  Primal, like, morality steps in and tells you?  Wait a minute, there must be a guy and he's watching.  I can't do this.  16, sometimes 15.  16, 15 years old?  Sometimes 15.  15.  15, you think?  That's the...  Yeah.  Back in the...  That's the caveman cutoff point?  That's the caveman club over the head.  Cut off point.  She doesn't even have hair on her back.  I'm not going to do...  Can you imagine the shit that was going on during the caveman era?  During the pilgrim era?  Pilgrim...  Well, when did they live till?  You know, they kind of died young back then. 
[01:23:00]  They died at 30, so they had to get going at...  So they had to start a little early.  Yeah, sure.  They were an old fucking school marm by 19.  You're right.  Someone had to finally look around their little town and go, what the...  We need some laws.  This has to stop.  This has to stop.  Because I know 13...  Look, I started...  You know, you start early.  There's always a girl that fucks everybody in the neighborhood, you know what I mean,  when you're growing up.  So we started at 12 and 13, you know.  And they were...  The girls, you know what I mean?  So I know... 
[01:23:30]  But they're talking about, you know, it's not 13 on 13.  13 on 13.  That happens.  You're talking, you know, this guy's in his 50s trying to hook up with a 12-year-old.  But they got the game of a 12-year-old.  Yeah.  Like...  I'm coming over.  Kid, I...  Like, they don't have any...  Shave anything else besides your legs?  It's not even seduction.  It's not...  They're not seducing the kid.  No.  It's the mentality of a 12-year-old.  Yeah.  Tom makes a good point in Indiana.  Tom? 
[01:24:00]  How you doing, boys?  Hey.  Morning.  Hey, how many of these guys do you think are going to ice themselves?  I mean, you're on TV.  You've even caught one of the fucked little kids.  How in the fuck could you go anywhere and live?  Yeah, you think they're going to just blow their brains out or hang themselves or something?  You know, I bet you get a running toad board.  I bet half of these fuckers on here are going to get nailed.  Yeah, because you can't go to Thanksgiving with the rest of the family.  Fuck, where could you go?  You don't have a job anymore.  You're not going back to your cubicle.  I think this isn't some more conspiracy shit. 
[01:24:30]  It's like I just think the media just runs our thought processes so much.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  They decide how long we think about this.  You know what I mean?  So he gets fired, but it's like no one really cares.  You know what I mean?  Once they're done with this, this Dateline, we're moving on to the next thing.  Did you see Dateline?  Next week we'll be talking about, with the same affection, the cleanest restaurants, the  cleanest fast food restaurants.  Right.  I was into that when they were talking about fucking things nasty.  And these guys will just be bobbing in last week's wake like of the destroyer that is 
[01:25:00]  the fucking Dateline show.  But they got to continue with their lives.  Yeah.  How do you look at your family?  How do you fucking go to your family?  There's a way to get out of that.  Dyslexia is easy.  I thought she said she was 21.  It's so easy to just bullshit.  You think?  And Aladdin?  Come on.  Aladdin?  Just say I'm retarded.  Look, nigga, my mama named me Aladdin.  Do you know the pressure?  All right.  Let's get back to this.  They got to know it's a setup, though.  They got to know it's some kind of setup. 
[01:25:30]  That's why it's so easy to get out of this.  It's so...  They might be holding back something.  Maybe grandma will look the other way.  Would anybody in this room...  In her own thoughts, she knows what's going on.  Would you fall for that?  Would you just go...  I wouldn't even be in the position where I could fall for that.  Where you would be in that position.  But if you was in that little goofy...  Like, if I was talking to a chick that was supposed to be my age,  and she said, come on over, baby.  I'd be like, whoa, what kind of setup is this?  Yeah, you're going to get there.  Her guys are going to beat the shit out of you and rob you.  You're out your mind. 
[01:26:00]  We got to talk a little longer than this.  But some kid goes, come on, see me at...  But they're doing it.  I mean, the point we're making, though.  I mean, do you go back to your regular life?  And how is that?  How is that?  How do you go through that?  Or do you live the rest of your days by yourself somewhere?  Hermit.  Everyone's watching football on Thanksgiving, and there you're...  You come over.  It's like, hey.  They're talking about you before you get there.  Right.  You come in.  Oh, here he is.  Hey, how you doing?  Sit down.  Let's try to make him feel comfortable.  Yeah.  Let's not bring it up. 
[01:26:30]  Hey, look.  It's either a 12-year-old or this turkey.  Hey, yeah.  Don't fuck the turkey.  Yeah, buy two turkeys.  One I can fuck, one I can eat, and then maybe I can stop.  Yeah, we're all having turkey, but I hear you like chicken.  All right, here we go.  More audio.  Just about every one of them gave me the same story.  So this is the first time?  Mm-hmm.  You know, I hear a lot of that.  Yeah, it's true.  I've never visited a teenage boy before in my life.  The goodest time in my life is this how you do. 
[01:27:00]  First time?  Yes, sir.  I've never done this before.  And some came up with more creative excuses.  She says she was 13 as well.  It's not just me by herself.  It's nice to me to stop and talk to her.  So you're just being a good Samaritan?  Yeah.  Because there was a 13-year-old girl all alone.  Yeah.  Right.  And so out of the goodness of your heart, you were going to stop by.  Yeah, I could be anybody.  And babysitter?  Is that the deal?  Well, I guess.  My lawyer's going to say.  God, why didn't one of these guys just punch him in the head? 
[01:27:30]  That swarmy reply in the face.  I'm thinking you were here for some kind of sexual...  Nah, just come.  You said Mr. Master Scream, this is a setup.  You lied to me, mother...  Oh, no.  I didn't write that.  I didn't write that.  I didn't put that.  That's book that...  Right.  No one's denying it at all.  I'm going to sit down right now.  First of all, you said you was a video ho.  I got the...  If I thought you was...  Nigga, just go Acho fucking mind. 
[01:28:00]  Do you understand what I'm saying?  That's why.  Were they all white guys?  Yeah, well, there was Aladdin.  Aladdin was what?  Mostly white guys.  In Arab?  Yeah.  Bul-dab-l.  Arabian?  Yeah.  Bul-dab-l 13.  Bul-dab-l 13.  Bul-dab-l pedophilia.  They have curly shoes.  See what that paranoia, that old saying is?  It's like, look at that black paranoia keep you from tip-toeing over somebody's goddamn  house like that.  You know what I mean?  You never do shit like that. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  It's just, you don't even want the suspicion that that shit is happening.  Like we've talked about in the past, if I walk into a bathroom and there's only a kid  in there, I am out so fast.  And I'm not even kidding about this.  No.  I am out so fast.  Before that door is shut, I am back out because I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  You know, 99 out of a, you know, one out of a billion.  It acts so fucking lootly.  All you need is for that kid to say something.  I want to be on camera going in and out of that fucking bathroom in a second and then 
[01:29:00]  go, that.  If I see a kid in the mall walking by, I get so mad because I'm on camera.  Yeah.  And I'm just imagining they're docking up that picture of me holding the hand, the skip  jump picture of walking out the mall, but I'm going, no, I was bringing it to the parents.  Where's my mommy?  Oh, he's over here.  Skip, skip, skip.  Kid's gone.  You're holding the hand.  Yeah, man.  Fuck that.  It's like, where's your, hello? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  It's like, hello?  I could be accused of pedophilia here.  That's it.  Keep your goddamn kid where everyone can see him.  In a public place, in a fucking elevator.  Are you out your mind?  I will be as far away from any kid in a fucking elevator as is humanly possible.  You can't do that.  Because, yeah, you don't want, you know.  Oh, at the movies, afterwards, some kid's pissing next to me in the urinal.  I'm like, why is this happening?  There should be a guy who's with a thing, I'm his dad, holding, you know, I'm his dad. 
[01:30:00]  You don't let him do it.  It's like.  All alone in the bathroom.  Dude, what if he just comes, if he just goes, you know what?  I feel like playing around.  Ah!  Yeah.  I can try to grab my balls!  And you know what?  You ain't talking yourself out of it in front of the fucking door of the bathroom with the  pop.  You're not going, well, it didn't happen, obviously.  I couldn't even convince myself.  All right, you can go home.  There'd be cops there.  Their knees would be in the back of your neck so quick.  And then you'd have to be explaining it down there.  I didn't fuck. 
[01:30:30]  Well, you could cop a plea.  You could go.  And it's over, Johnny.  No, I was taking a piss.  You took a piss on him?  Oh, I am.  Mr. Kumi, is it true you know the words to Hakuna Matata?  I was pissing.  I swear to you.  I was at Disney.  I go to Disney.  Why do you go to Disney a lot?  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, do you have kids?  Yes, I do.  Do any of you know the entire?  No, no.  I don't know all the words.  Do you know the remix to Hakuna Matata? 
[01:31:00]  Mr. Kumi, do you know the words to Hakuna Matata?  Would you sing it to us right now?  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Hakuna Matata.  I'd like to settle.  Wait.  Hakuna Matata.  I don't know the song.  Well, we have a tape.  You're singing it pretty good.  Here's you on the radio.  Hakuna Matata.  It means no worries for the rest of your days.  The philosophy.  Your Honor, I'd like to submit this tape into evidence. 
[01:31:30]  This is the People's Evidence No. 38.  Cut a deal.  It means no worries.  Yeah.  Wow.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  I guess I'm not going to be going out on Halloween.  We still have an undercover tape of him at karaoke only doing that song.  Hakuna Matata.  Hakuna Matata.  Hakuna Matata.  Hakuna Matata.  That is some shit.  I get that, man.  That scares the dog shit out of me, man. 
[01:32:00]  Listen, we got to go to the phones.  We got to try to move forward a little bit.  Maddie, a girl in Florida, I guess.  Maddie.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  How old are you, Maddie?  We love that the girls call this program when Jimmy's not here.  For some reason.  Yeah, we get more phone calls from girls when Jimmy's not here.  For some reason, they feel like they could call in when Jimmy's not here.  Yeah.  Just so we notice.  That's all.  She said she was Maddie from Florida.  Yes.  Hey, Maddie.  Hey.  So what do you got? 
[01:32:30]  I was just saying, you know, these pedophiles, once they get caught doing something like this,  do you think when they go to Thanksgiving dinner with their family that, you know, they get told,  well, you're not going to be sitting at the kiddie table anymore?  Yeah, no kiddie table.  They are far away from the kiddie table.  A hell of a way to not sit at the kiddie table anymore.  You get the head of the table by proxy.  And she's in Florida, right?  Yeah.  Florida has, like, a pedophile epidemic.  Do they?  That's all you ever hear is, like, that last one that hurt me.  Usually, I don't even think about that one that they show the guy at the car wash grabbing the girl. 
[01:33:00]  That one got me.  And that's from Florida.  Are they all from Florida, dude?  There's a lot of Floridians out there messing around.  Was the girl with the little pink Kangol hat, wasn't she from Florida or something like that?  Jesus.  There's a lot of them from Florida, dude.  Hey, speaking of being in the bathroom, Mario in Virginia has a story.  Mario.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey, Mario.  Mario.  Oh, man.  Guys, you don't understand.  I tell Anthony brought this up. 
[01:33:30]  I was at a movie theater, and I couldn't hold it anymore.  And I go to take a piss, and I'm mistreating this little kid who walks in by himself.  And he starts staring at my junk, and I'm just peeing there.  And I'm circumcised.  And he stares at it, looks at me, and he goes, oh, my God, you have a magical penis.  I freaked out.  Stop it.  It's a magical penis.  Is it true that you have a magical penis, sir?  That was Aladdin.  Oh, Aladdin.  Yes, I do.  Yeah, rub it. 
[01:34:00]  I don't know about you, but my wish will come true.  Heavy pees, it goes.  Wow.  You don't want a kid pointing out your magical penis now.  Hot Carl in Wisconsin.  Hot Carl.  Hot Carl.  What's up, Hot Carl?  Hey, how you doing?  Say, I can't do the Casey case like Anthony does, but I think it goes something like that.  Dear Casey, I'm a 29-year-old 11th grade school teacher caught naked in a garage with beer by dateline. 
[01:34:30]  Could you please play prison sex by tools?  Sincerely, Kidfucker.  Well, Kidfucker.  And we got Bloodfart.  Bloodfart.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey, man.  Why are these guys sitting there?  I mean, I bet you Dateline promised them that they wouldn't turn into the cops to use their real name.  If it was me, I would just bail.  You got to, like, run immediately.  I don't understand why they didn't just, like, whip their head around so you get, like, a blurry picture of them and just run. 
[01:35:00]  Because people are dumb.  Yeah, people are stupid.  People are so stupid that you can absolutely, we're such a therapeutic country that you can absolutely talk your way out of this thing.  Yeah.  They knew to go, hey, man, I've got a problem.  And dogs, no one suggests fucking a dog.  It had to be done.  Like, someone suggested it to you for you to suggest it to somebody else.  Hey, you mind? 
[01:35:30]  You don't do dog fucking that one time that you try to do.  Right, right.  It's just like, that's what he's doing.  Well, a lot of these guys just didn't know what was going on.  They didn't know it's Dateline until, like, ten minutes into it.  If an adult is there, there's a problem.  Maybe they thought he was the madam.  Oh, really?  The madam?  Pedophile brothel.  They're going to be setting up.  Hey, what's happening, man?  Where'd you find this little sweet tender thing?  Yeah.  All right, let's get back to the audio here.  So why would a man with so much to lose risk everything to meet a child for sex? 
[01:36:00]  Dr. David Marcus, a clinical psychologist who treats men with sexual compulsions, says it's a powerful addiction.  They don't know what's driving them.  All they know is they're being driven and they can't stop.  And to risk themselves so greatly clearly shows how powerful a riot that is.  Very powerful.  They're just very worked up.  They know that there's, you know, a risk there, but they just are so worked up.  Yeah, this next clip is great because now they all find out they're on Dateline. 
[01:36:30]  And now they just want to find the nearest door.  And now they're about to learn I'm not a parent or the police.  First, the rabbi.  Could you please tell me who you are?  I'm more than happy to tell you who I am.  I am Chris Hansen with Dateline NBC and we're doing a story on computer predators.  Come on, come on, come on.  Stop, stop, stop.  You don't want it.  You don't want it.  You've got to stop this.  Sit down. 
[01:37:00]  Sit down.  You don't have any right.  You're afraid that you're afraid of leave any time.  You idiot.  Now they knew this was all being taped for the record and for broadcast on Dateline.  The doctor.  But if there's anything else you want to say, nothing.  The teacher.  And if there's anything else you'd like to say, we'd like to hear it.  And the man who stood naked in our kitchen.  Thank you.  I don't know what else to say.  It's not what else to say.  I don't know what else to say.  We took our candid cameras.  That's what it's like.  They give him the candid camera thing where Alan Funt steps in. 
[01:37:30]  We took our candid cameras and put him in a kitchen and had Fanny Flag pose as a 15-year-old boy.  Watch as the fun and hijinks start as he undresses and comes into the kitchen.  When it's least expected.  You're elected.  You're the star today.  Smile.  You're on candid camera.  With the hocus-pocus, you're in hocus. 
[01:38:00]  It's your lucky day.  Yeah, real lucky.  Smile.  Your head can't be.  Oh, you got me.  It's fun.  There's the camera.  It's right in the microwave oven.  It's fun.  Look at yourself.  I watch the show all the time.  I never thought I'd be caught.  This is fantastic.  You got me, mother of a answer.  You got me.  Nigga.  You got me fucking a child, man. 
[01:38:30]  Dude, you've been punked so bad.  Dude, you watch your mother of a lie.  Yeah, Ashton pops out.  Ashton pops out.  Dude, you're naked.  So awesome.  Right when you're lubing up the helmet, he's like, he's running out.  Okay, stop now.  Okay.  You've been punked.  All right.  You know what?  You better stop.  I'm a fucking kid in the ass.  I was getting ready to pump this child in the butt and hear you, because you're crazy, 
[01:39:00]  motherfucker.  Put me in guess who, too.  I thought I said I'd never be caught.  You mother...  Just when you thought this couldn't get any better, remember naked guy from earlier, Anthony?  You should forget him.  Showed up naked and with beer.  Well, he returns.  You might think that this 43-year-old man who walked into our house naked, ready to meet 
[01:39:30]  a 14-year-old boy for sex, would be so humiliated after being caught literally with his pants  down that he'd never try it again.  Yet we find him right back online, in a chat room, the very next day.  And again, the chat quickly turns sexual.  And believe it or not, again, he agrees to yet another date for sex.  Our decoy asks if he wants to meet at McDonald's.  But first, he confirms the meeting is not about food. 
[01:40:00]  He really wanted to make sure it was about sex.  So he decides to meet the kid at McDonald's.  Because obviously, they're not going to use the same trick and say, hey, come to the house.  He goes, now, you ain't dateline.  All right, I'm coming.  If he's sitting there at home going, what are the odds?  Come on.  It ain't going to happen again.  It ain't going to happen twice.  Not twice.  I'll meet you at the bottom of the ball pitch.  Wait, wait.  Even the kid types first.  The kid types first. 
[01:40:30]  And I'm not dateline, so don't worry.  All right, cool.  Because they tried to trick me yesterday.  Thanks, God.  Coincidence you even mentioned that.  Because yesterday, I was in a house.  That's weird.  You see that shit?  Well, listen to this.  I have been in television.  I got to set this up.  I saw this part.  So obviously, he's going to meet the kid at McDonald's.  Yeah.  Now they're staking out McDonald's.  Oh, my God.  And here comes the guy.  He's walking up to McDonald's.  What an asshole.  So the dude from Dateline gets right up to him. 
[01:41:00]  This is the first words he says to the naked guy who's now clothed at McDonald's.  He's hoping for another meeting with a young boy.  I have been in television for 24 years.  I just came to get something to eat.  And I have very seldom been at a loss for words.  Sir, I just came to get something to eat.  But I don't even know what to ask you first.  I just came to get something to eat.  Something to eat changes his story.  Last night, you walk into a house in suburban Washington, naked, 
[01:41:30]  with a 12-pack of beer, yes or no?  Yes.  Yeah.  Today, you're on the Internet again.  You have an inappropriate conversation with a boy you think is 13,  and you set up a meeting here at this fast food restaurant.  What was your intention?  I don't know.  The man admits he knows what he's doing is illegal.  Then why do you do it? 
[01:42:00]  I need help, and that's what I'm seeing a psychiatrist for.  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Georgia!  Thanks, Georgia!  God, is that fantastic.  How great is that?  Hey, man, how you doing?  Oh, Dateline again.  You guys want some fries?  What do you want?  Three quarter pounder with cheese?  Guys, I need how many?  Guys, the crew, the crew, everybody.  I'm buying.  I got it.  What do you want?  Cheeseburger?  Cokes, everybody. 
[01:42:30]  The chicken select.  The new sandwich with the chicken select.  I get a chicken select.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Sit down.  Chicken select.  Chicken select.  And some beer.  How fucking was he being?  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  Well, here's the final clip.  Don't these people know that this is illegal,  and that very possibly they could be talking to a decoy  or getting pulled into some sort of undercover investigation?  Well, if you look at the Internet  and the amount of people who are soliciting these types of crimes, 
[01:43:00]  the chances of getting caught are probably fairly slim.  Fairly slim.  Fairly slim.  I don't know.  It seems like everybody gets caught.  Yeah, you got caught twice in two days.  In two days.  Yeah, jeez.  Doesn't it just seem like everyone gets caught?  That's the unlucky lottery for that guy.  I don't think there's one guy typing to a kid,  meeting somewhere, having sex, going home,  putting his hands behind his head, leaning back on it.  Ah, that was great.  That worked out perfectly. 
[01:43:30]  I got away with it.  And, like, nothing ever happens.  I just don't see that happening.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area.  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  Mm.  Yes.  Sure.  One of the most famous news teases.  Makes you believe it, almost.  All right, Ant.  We got brand new news teases.  Ah.  We love the news teases.  Yeah, we'll try to get through this after the break.  Also, in honor of the dude that sounded a lot like Casey Kasem,  we got to play the Casey Kasem outtakes.  Ah, one of my favorites.  As we go to break here.  Check this out. 
[01:44:00]  The Countdown will begin this Sunday afternoon at 1,  right here on the radio station you grew up with.  Music Radio 138.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell's going on here?  Geez, well, isn't it the last hour?  We got another hour to do?  Geez, I thought we were almost finished.  Good golly, Miss Molly.  Boy, this is fucking ponderous, man.  Ponderous.  Fucking ponderous.  Hi, this is Casey Kasem.  American Top 40 has moved to a new time.  I hope you'll join me this Saturday morning 
[01:44:30]  and every Saturday morning at 2, 2.  Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication.  And this one is about kids and pets  and a situation that we can all understand,  whether we have kids or pets or neither.  It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio,  and here's what he writes.  Dear Casey,  this may seem to be a strange dedication request,  but I'm quite sincere,  and it'll need a lot if you play it.  Recently, there was a death in our family.  He was a little dog named Snuggles, 
[01:45:00]  but he was most certainly a part of...  Let's go start again.  From coming out of the record.  Play the record, okay?  Please.  See, when you come out of those up-tempo goddamn numbers, man,  it's impossible to make those transitions,  and then you gotta go into somebody dying.  You know, they do this to me all the time.  I don't know what the hell they do it for,  but goddamn it,  if we can't come out of a slow record,  I don't understand it.  Is Don on the phone?  Okay, I want a goddamn concerted effort 
[01:45:30]  to come out of a record  that isn't a fucking up-tempo record  every time I do a goddamn death dedication.  Now, make it...  And I also want to know  what happened to the pictures  I was supposed to see this week.  Because the last goddamn time,  I want somebody to use his fucking brain  to not come out of a goddamn record  that's up-tempo,  and I gotta talk about a fucking dog dying.  The Opie and Anthony Show  presents Things Women Never Say.  Hmm, make me cry myself to sleep.  Baby, you really need to drink more. 
[01:46:00]  Tell me my cooking sucks  and punch me in the face.  Of course you can bang my friends.  There is nothing I enjoy more  than being hit on by drunk fat guys.  I like my penis.  When I come home from work,  you better be passed out drunk on the floor  and your pants filled with brownies.  It's okay if you think about my sister  while we're fucking.  Please, get drunk and hit on all my friends.  Snort a lot of coke  and kick me down the steps.  All that talk is crazy.  Ah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program 
[01:46:30]  on XM Satellite Radio.  It's a virus, the ONA virus spreading across America.  Thank you, XM.  They're kind of waking up.  I'm getting reports.  There's billboards all over the place.  Oh, yeah.  We're part of the main advertising  that's going on in all the hot magazines out there.  I'm very happy with the marketing  and the way they're pushing the show now. 
[01:47:00]  There's a pullout in almost every magazine  that's on newsstands right now.  Oh, yeah.  It's a huge XM pullout,  and we're part of that.  Our pictures are on there.  It's just great.  Things are turning around for us.  That's nice.  I love it.  Are you happy now?  Hugh Jett and Rolling Stone magazine.  Are you happy now?  See, you guys are all confused.  I'm a much happier person.  Are you happy?  That is coming together now.  Yes, I'm very happy.  You feeling better?  Yes, I am.  All right, good.  God bless you, man.  I'm a happier person in general.  Everyone would say that. 
[01:47:30]  Absolutely.  Wow.  He didn't even pause.  No.  I like that.  Because I know when Opie came back,  it was Genghis Khan, baby.  He was like,  I'm going to get revenge on all you sons of bitches,  and now Opie, look at his face.  No, nothing was worse than end of tenure at N.E.W. Opie.  That was when he was at just the height.  I think it was professional problems because of the work environment,  some personal problems with relationships,  which I went through at one point during the radio career there. 
[01:48:00]  It just all seemed like it was falling apart.  So, yeah, it was just, you know.  Was suicide in there?  Tell the truth.  No, no.  And then the company.  Did it creep in?  Not serious.  Did it creep in?  Not even in a serious, I'm going to kill myself,  but just like, let me just finish it.  Let me just get it out of here.  No, I just started wandering around America for like two years.  And we tried to help you too anytime we bump it  because that was tough crowd times.  So, I was on my high.  He's like, what's up, old baby?  What's happening?  Opie was just pulling Kung Fu.  How's that little show going on?  Oh, it's still off?  Oh, that old crazy old damn it. 
[01:48:30]  They take it off?  Let me, I got to go do tough crowd.  And I talk to you, man.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's like, hey, you're still on Brazil?  Oh, this guy's on Brazil, baby?  Yeah, they were trying to talk me into going to Rio.  We still showed you a lot of love, though.  We wasn't like, oh, you ain't got no radio show for you.  No, I watched very closely,  and I made a list of who my friends are,  who my true friends are.  Who was naughty and who was nice.  And Patrice made the list.  Yeah, because we see, oh, what's up?  Oh, because I never thought about you as the radio guy.  And then there were people that really surprised me.  I'm like, wow, I thought that dude  would have, like, supported me through this, 
[01:49:00]  but absolutely not.  Every time I see him, let's get a nigga, fuck that.  Yeah.  Let's go to Brazil, man.  Me, you, come on.  Suitcase.  And then we had no respect with the company.  We were making them just ridiculous money,  and they didn't give a fuck about us.  It was all about Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard, Howard.  Did you get any revenge?  Howard, Howard, Howard.  Listen, we're getting revenge every day now.  I was getting ready to say, stop.  I don't want to hear the,  we get revenge by putting on a great show.  Oh, no, no, nothing like that.  I'm talking about did you get some,  like somebody where you just,  you just go, thank you. 
[01:49:30]  Thank you that he got to just be fucked up on us.  Let's see.  We did some things.  We got some things done.  You know, just like.  John Sykes wound up getting thrown out,  which was good.  Right, something like that.  Something really good.  Oh, yeah.  Somebody lost a job.  He wound up getting thrown out,  and the company itself lost millions and millions of dollars.  And millions of dollars based on.  Millions to a broadcasting company,  like Infinity Broadcasting, whatever,  but we're talking 10, 20, 30, 40 million.  Which means somebody you've got their head for. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  A head roll.  And every radio station we were syndicated to,  just about, with no exceptions,  just still blow.  Good.  All those radio stations.  That's what I'm talking about.  Forget that.  We get revenge.  We're on at WNW here in New York.  They're still,  still trying to get some real ratings over there.  Still.  And just the fact that they're scrambling,  three plus years later.  They're scrambling trying to replace Howard.  Just the fact that they're scrambling,  they're throwing in what is going to amount to,  and you don't have to be Kreskin to figure this one out,  complete failures. 
[01:50:30]  These are going to be abominations  when people replace Howard in the morning.  Absolutely.  When it's David Lee Roth.  I thought he might be good, though.  David Lee might be good.  We started the show off explaining radio.  David Lee Roth doesn't have it.  He doesn't have it in him.  He can be an entertaining guest.  Yeah, he could be on every once in a while.  The first two weeks of his show might even be good.  Then after that, when you realize,  oh, fuck, I just talked about everything  that has ever happened to me in my life.  That's the thing about Ray.  That's the thing that amazes me. 
[01:51:00]  That's when you need a radio guy  to kind of figure all this shit out.  Like, oh, we'll start playing games.  We'll do this.  We'll make up some cute little, you know,  showcase bits like whip him out Wednesday  and assault on the media.  He doesn't have that shit in him.  So does it...  And it amazes me the company doesn't understand that.  You can't just throw, like, these entertainers into radio  and assume they're just going to be successful.  It just rarely happens.  Does the square radio come at you guys?  They don't have the work ethic. 
[01:51:30]  They don't have the work ethic.  They come back at you like, okay.  Like, mainstream radio, do they come back and go,  do they go, hey, okay, all the Christian shit's over?  Yeah, yeah.  What's his name, Kale?  What's the comic that everybody blamed for?  Paul McCurie.  Dumb Paul McCurie.  Paul, stupid Michael McCurie.  And it's like, after, okay, he faded away  and that faded away, dude, they go,  listen, fellas, come on back.  We had a chance to go back to regular radio.  It just didn't make sense anymore.  Just didn't.  And we did it all.  So why would we go back there  and try to do the same show we were doing  with a whole bunch of new rules? 
[01:52:00]  Fuck that.  Right, right, right, right.  So we're like, let's go for the freedom thing  and we'll build with the industry.  And I was talking about this thing.  It's like, they're just now, cable TV,  they're just now trying to fuck with cable television.  Yeah, so that means they're not going to fuck  with cable radio for another 40 years.  You know, satellite radio is like,  they're not like the FCC type of people.  They're not going to come trying to mess with the shows  because they're just now going Sopranos.  I didn't like that scene in the Sopranos.  I know, good luck.  So they're just now trying to like mess 
[01:52:30]  with cable television.  Good luck.  FX is swearing.  They do whatever they want.  You watch Dennis Leary's show,  they're saying shit all the time.  Right.  Prick.  Cock.  Oh, they're going crazy.  So I'm happy that it's going well  because we were always like,  we were like,  oh, what, nigga, you can't be back.  We would never see him.  We would see him at a show.  Oh, yeah.  Once in a while.  Every so often, I'd show up at Caroline's.  And you'd be with your girl and Fat Man.  And Big Kev.  Big Kev.  Yeah.  And, hey, what's up?  You leave, but I'll be around. 
[01:53:00]  We're like, what the fuck, man?  What's going on?  I was just like,  I went into hibernation,  just wandering around by myself,  just trying to figure it all out.  Dude, this has been my life  since I was like 18, you know?  I'm such a loser.  I always think I'm going to just pop up somewhere.  So I'm just thinking,  oh, you'll pop up somewhere.  I'm not even thinking about a career or lifestyle.  I'm just like,  man, you'll pop up somewhere.  Come on.  Let's just...  No, we knew this time  we really fucked up.  Bad.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Bad.  And if the satellite radio didn't come along,  I mean, it's perfect timing.  And I'm so lazy.  I thought y'all was getting paid at the time, right? 
[01:53:30]  Paid and just sat on the shelf.  I've been so unhappy.  Nah.  You just wanted to be on the radio.  Yeah, we know we could have made the same money  being on the air.  We'd rather have been working.  This is a lifestyle, you know?  Did the break do you good?  Did you come back like,  like, oh, this is...  I actually might have needed that.  It was...  No.  For the first couple of months,  it was cool.  It was like, you know,  now that I think about it,  we were a little angry.  And, you know,  there were some of those days  where you're just like,  you don't want to be here  and you're getting yelled at and shit.  So the first couple of months, 
[01:54:00]  you're traveling,  everything's cool.  And then you're like,  all right, only, you know,  two years to go.  Yeah, I think...  It kind of sucked.  I think it did Anthony and I good, though.  No, that's what I'm saying.  No, I'm saying it.  As a show.  I think we were starting to lose  a little of the passion for this  at the end there  because we were so frustrated.  Just beaten down.  We were getting beat up all the time.  On WNEW.  Yeah.  It turned out they re-upped our contracts  just to keep us away  from competing with Howard.  Right, that's what I said.  And I wish we knew that.  I wish we knew that at the time, you know, 
[01:54:30]  because they never really wanted us  at that company.  Their whole strategy was to pay them  a lot of money,  give them some markets and syndication  to keep them from competing with Howard.  That's what happens when Mel Karmazin  is in charge of a company.  That's what happens.  Howard is the top dog,  which, you know, fine, whatever.  Right, right.  But if you're also part of that company,  you're treated like shit.  You're a second-class citizen.  We had an option to go to Clear Channel. 
[01:55:00]  They were making an offer that was huge.  We were going to do mornings at Q104.  We were going to do mornings at Q  and go against Howard.  And the funny thing is,  when we were negotiating our contracts,  they were coming to an end.  The offer they had was so ridiculous  for what we accomplished.  We're like, are you kidding me?  And they're like, well, this is our final offer.  You know, they're playing a little hardball.  Infinity was saying that.  So we turned around and Clear Channel said,  well, fuck that.  We'll give you five times what they're offering.  We'll give you this and the markets  they're going to give us.  Is this before or after the incident? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, this is before.  Oh, and in the incident, everybody set up.  Yeah, but look.  So not only were they going to give us mornings,  like, I don't know, a ridiculous raise,  like four or five times what we were making at the time,  they also were going to throw us in all these markets.  Syndicated markets around the country.  And Finney, you know, a lot of people think  Finney was the good guys  because they syndicated the Open Anthony show.  They had no choice.  They did not want to syndicate this show.  You know, three years after being kicked out of Boston  when we had huge ratings up there,  we still weren't even being heard back in Boston.  And they owned property there. 
[01:56:00]  They signed us because they didn't want us  going against Howard.  It was, watch Rocky III.  It was such a fact.  Watch Rocky III.  And you'll see, I was protecting you, Rock.  Remember that?  That's what Mel is to Howard.  He's a wrecking machine.  He'll tear you to shreds, Rock.  So how many years did this incident rejuvenate your spirit?  Like, what, another 10?  Oh, yeah.  You might get, you know, retire to some small market. 
[01:56:30]  Get like, whatever, get all, you know, all litimony.  No, the satellite radio thing is so exciting  and growing by leaps and bounds.  Like, when we got hired, XM had 2.2 million subscribers.  I'm hearing they're around 5.2 now.  And one lousy year.  One lousy year.  It's grown that much.  And then we've just been added to the XM Canada lineup.  We have this huge DirecTV deal that XM made  that we're going to be part of that.  We're going to be exposed to, like, 15 million homes.  Obviously, not all of them are going to pick us up. 
[01:57:00]  Probably a small percentage.  But when you start adding it up,  now we're talking to a huge audience again.  The thought of going on the air on regular radio  and getting done with the show  and having a guy go,  after today, you can no longer say poo-poo.  Oh, there's none of that on XM.  There's nothing on XM like that.  Nothing.  We have not heard one thing.  So just to finish the story,  so then we go to Clear Channel.  They give us the huge raise that we deserved.  We really proved ourselves for, like, 
[01:57:30]  three years here in New York.  And then they're like,  not only are we going to throw you in more,  you're going to compete against Howard,  we're going to throw you in another, like,  I think it was, like, 15 cities or something like that.  So we go marching down the hall to Ken Stevens,  our boss at the time.  Like, hey, we're leaving, man.  You said that was our final offer.  Well, this is what we got.  And I remember Ken's face like,  just give me an hour.  He was, like, freaked out.  And we're just sitting around in our office laughing,  just being goofy, waiting,  and then all hell broke loose with the company. 
[01:58:00]  And next thing you know,  we're meeting with the big, big guys,  and they're sitting us down going,  okay, we're going to sign you.  We're going to match the money.  No problem.  Right away.  We're in a conference room for, like, an hour and a half.  We're going to match the money.  No problem.  Oh, now it's no problem.  But y'all stayed at Infinity, then.  And then they're like,  and we'll see all these cities.  We'll match that, too.  So we'll find a property in all these cities  that were close enough,  and we'll give you a few extra.  Is that good?  So you stayed at Infinity.  That was the choice we made, unfortunately.  That's our fault.  We should have left.  Who likes you? 
[01:58:30]  Clan Channel likes you.  I'll tell you what happened, though, with this.  We should have left.  I kicked myself every day  that we didn't leave at that point, you know,  because we kind of knew what the company was all about.  But we didn't know what Clear Channel was all about.  Clear Channel.  Yeah, and we were starting to hear the stories  that they were getting a little tight.  We'd have been gone by them, too.  We'd have fucked up.  I don't even think the Catholics had it like that.  That's the whole thing that went through my mind  every time we see Norton.  If you thought you would be...  Norton was in deep, like, emotional calm. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, Norton goes by his emotions.  I mean, when he's happy, you know it.  You go, God damn, Norton, do I have to know you're happy?  When he's mad, you know it.  When he's sad, you know it.  He's just useless when it comes to this kind of phony kind of,  I gotta go, I gotta go to sleep.  Like, he kept going home and preparing  as if the radio was coming back on,  so he would go to sleep at 10,  hoping that, you know, you get the call the next day.  And we would just go, you know, cheer up, dude.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Thank God you guys had tough crowds and stuff, 
[01:59:30]  because he would have killed himself.  That pulled us out, but we never thought about it.  Like, we used to just laugh about Paul.  We didn't know how big it was.  We didn't know how big of a deal that was.  But I didn't know the Catholic Church,  that's what I kept saying.  The Catholic Church has it like this?  Yeah.  I never heard of that.  No, the Catholic Church never commented about what we did.  I subscribed to Jews as the most,  the major in your career person,  or people, whatever. 
[02:00:00]  And I did not know that that could happen.  It's such a surprise, man.  It's just a big company that got scared  and knee-jerked and threw us off the air  because they didn't want a bad publicity.  Yeah, so we should have left.  I'm not going to lie to you.  But it's good to see you back.  It's good to see you face back.  But we knew what we had at Infinity.  I'm like, all right, we know what we got here.  We don't know how it's going to...  We just should have done it, though.  Because then we're sitting there in the office like,  all right, well, the money's good,  and you're going to match the markets.  That's good. 
[02:00:30]  And then Ant and I look at each other,  because now we're feeling cocky.  You negotiated your own deal?  No, no, our agent helped us out,  but we certainly did a good job ourselves.  And we're sitting there, like,  we had him by the balls.  We're like, what about this thing with Howard  where we can't mention his name?  What was it called again?  The gag order.  The gag order.  This is the God's honest truth,  which just amazes me to this day,  that Howard would pull this shit behind the scenes. 
[02:01:00]  A guy that went after everybody,  took on all enemies,  and beat them up  and did whatever he had to.  But then when we showed a little power  and that we weren't scared,  instead of, like, you know,  fighting us, you know, toe-to-toe,  he went to Mel Karmazin and the big boys.  And he actually got a gag order  where we couldn't mention his name.  So then we were referring to him as Radio Edit.  We couldn't say Radio Edit anymore.  Then we would be like, you know,  the guy.  Who, who, who, who, who.  Oh, no, you can't say who, who.  So then the lawyers...  You can't even elude.  Dude, the lawyers started coming up with a whole list. 
[02:01:30]  You can't say his name.  You can't say who, who.  You can't say Radio Edit.  You can't say Baba Booey.  You can't say this.  Nothing.  You know, because he was pulling some shit.  We're like, fuck this.  He ain't going to do what he did  to DeBell and all those other fucking guys  in the old days.  He ain't knocking us down ever.  Right, right, right, right.  So we, we, we kept going and, you know,  we risked our own careers, like, getting fired.  So the gag order was in place, bad.  And then they realized we just were coming up  with a whole new word to, to, uh, uh, to, uh, refer to him. 
[02:02:00]  The list started getting longer and longer.  So then they're like, what the fuck?  They're just not listening.  So then they had a long delay system.  Like, all right, anything that sounds like  it has anything to do with, uh, his show,  dump out of the fucking show, or you're fired.  Meaning some of the behind the scenes guys.  But would he not, would he not fuck around with you guys?  Oh, he'd call, he'd say the,  Oh, fuck yeah, he did.  He'd say the clones across the street.  Right.  So, and, and the excuse they would give him,  we'd say, well, he's talking about us.  He goes, no, he's not saying your name.  Well, we're not saying his, yeah,  but we know what you mean.  Well, we know what he means. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, that's different.  Wow, no alluding.  Oh, it, it was just.  It was amazing.  So, so now, getting back to negotiating,  you know, the money was good, the markets was good,  and we're like, what about the gag order?  This was a serious, oh, yeah.  It'll be in your contract that you can talk to anybody you want.  Yeah, you can talk about any Infinity personalities.  That's how desperate they were.  But they had a plan I didn't know at the time.  Like, it'll be in your contract,  you're allowed to talk about him,  and anyone else you wanted in Infinity Broadcasting.  They just wanted to make sure they had control of us still. 
[02:03:00]  So we signed.  Right.  And their plan was,  all right, you can talk about anybody you want.  You want to mention Howard?  Go ahead.  Oh, but we'll fire Ken Stevens, your boss.  Jeremy Coleman.  We'll fire Jeremy Coleman.  Your producer is.  And put in people in there that can, you know,  have some control over you and your show.  And, and.  Oh, nice.  Thank you.  Even the alluding.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it went right back to how it was,  even though it was in our contract,  we're allowed to do this. 
[02:03:30]  We're like, what the fuck?  We were in that office.  You should have smacked your A's upside the head  for not catching that, that little loophole.  So then, you know,  this shit plays in your head.  And then, you know,  we're doing the shock jock edgy shit.  And, you know,  to be honest,  we were like taking chances going,  what do we have to lose in the end?  You know?  Yeah.  That plays into it a little bit.  I'm not going to lie to you.  No.  We weren't happy.  So then, was that stunt,  did you even think that that stunt  was going to be that bad?  Did you have an inkling?  Well, it was, you know,  obviously we had church on the list, 
[02:04:00]  but when Paul Mercurio,  you had Paul Micrum,  you were trying to be creative.  When Paul Mercurio called from the church  and he was trying to make a name for himself  because, you know,  he was starting to get a little buzz on our show  for some other things he did,  like the famous Kathleen,  put your goddamn clothes on  in the middle of The Graduate.  Kathleen Turner.  I remember, I remember that.  That flops.  She's getting naked.  Hilarious, man.  And we set up this bit  where a Broadway show,  Kathleen Turner was getting naked every night.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes on.  Right.  We set it up with Paul. 
[02:04:30]  He stands up in the audience  and shouts it,  gets it on tape,  everything.  We played it on the radio forever  and he became huge in the fans' eyes.  Huge.  Yep.  And he even made fucking T-shirts.  He was so happy.  All the comedians blamed him,  but did you guys blame him?  Was you guys on him like that?  No, it's...  At the time...  It was hard not to.  It was hard not to.  It's a tough call.  Because is it something he did?  Yeah, it was like...  We felt like he...  I mean, obviously,  we felt there was a time during that whole thing 
[02:05:00]  that he could have, like,  at least got out of the situation.  Would that have helped in the end?  I don't know.  Has he been here?  Fuck no.  I don't know.  No.  All right, guys.  I don't really want to talk to him.  It's time to let it go.  Listen to me, man.  I don't think so.  It's time to let...  You got to heal.  Dude.  You got to see him.  You got to talk to him.  And you got to let him heal.  Because he has been destroyed.  I was...  Enough suffering.  Really?  Heal now.  He didn't want to get you guys...  Patrice.  You got to drop the air.  Really?  Just...  Looking good, right?  I'm standing up for you.  This body was 30 pounds lighter 
[02:05:30]  because of that motherfucker.  Fuck him.  Oh, you just...  You started to fade away.  I was fading fast, bro.  He was all looking concentration campy.  Oh, yeah.  If we had to sit out another year  instead of the two we did,  I don't know if I would have made it.  Really?  I wasn't eating.  You were dying.  I was awful.  I was doing Slim Fast and bananas.  That's what I ate every day.  You know what it was about, Paul?  You were anorexic?  Male anorexic.  Which amazes me.  I didn't think I could...  I had it in me, 
[02:06:00]  but that's what happened.  You can't...  Wait a minute.  You cannot...  Let's be serious for a second.  You cannot...  Not even to...  You mean to look at him  just to go...  Dude, we went to Manny's wake  and then went to the diner afterwards.  You were looking at me like,  whoa, dude, start eating.  What the fuck?  You were even concerned.  Like, oh, what the fuck is...  Because I always thought...  I never...  You know what?  You can't crawl inside somebody's body  or mine.  But I was like...  I did not think you guys...  I didn't think anything happened  because I always think... 
[02:06:30]  Like the TLT,  I always think we have  a marketable skill.  Yeah.  Like Marv Albert  with all his little panties  and no one's better than Marv Albert  as color commentator.  So we thought...  We had...  But when it's you...  When it's you,  it becomes different.  It becomes different.  Exactly.  It's totally different.  We had articles  from all over the world  in all sorts of languages.  I was just convinced,  man, we are going to be  so blackballed  and we are done.  But just...  And people are like,  well, at least you were getting paid.  Well, great.  You got to be happy  to be spending that money, right? 
[02:07:00]  I wasn't happy.  Wow.  Fuck yeah, dude.  All right, all right.  Fuck him.  So there was a time we felt,  you know,  even though Paul was,  you know,  in a weird situation,  you know,  he could have got out  of the situation  and chose to keep going,  keep going,  screaming stuff like,  where's your God now?  And even the cops were like,  get out of here.  And he's like,  I ain't leaving.  He wouldn't leave.  Who knows?  Who knows if that would have helped?  Was it a funny feeling  in either one  of the pits of your stomach?  Like, oh, gee, Paul,  get the...  Get out of here, Paul. 
[02:07:30]  Absolutely.  Know what it was with our...  Absolutely.  Know what it was  with our old show, too?  And this is the rule  Paul, like,  just ran past.  We did some crazy shit,  without a doubt.  And we'll continue  to do crazy shit.  But there was always something,  whether it was Anthony,  myself,  or other people  that were doing  these stunts,  let's call them,  they always knew  when to bail.  Just knew.  To save the show.  Yeah.  And you know what?  And we learned  a long time ago,  that point is a lot further  than most people  would take it.  You know,  you could really go 
[02:08:00]  way, way further  than most people would do.  But something happened  when you felt it.  But all of a sudden  you'd be like,  all right,  we got something out of this,  we got the whole fucking  city talking,  the whole country talking  in a lot of cases,  time to bail.  Leave.  Time to get the fuck out,  there's no reason  to stay any longer.  You can save a life.  And he...  He looks like  Angelita Jolie now.  And he just kept going,  kept going,  kept going,  and I'm like,  oh man.  And he looks like Gia.  Gia.  He looks like Gia.  He's sick now.  I want you guys 
[02:08:30]  to go home  and think about this  after today.  Fuck him,  he's got an Emmy.  Fuck him.  All right,  cool.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Oh my God.  I think we need to dwell on...  I was just trying to see  if I could be  an actual psychologist.  It didn't work.  Damn,  y'all are cold, baby.  Don't we have more  fun material to run through  today than this crap?  Oh, really?  I was just interested.  I don't know.  I know.  We've just run through  it so many fucking times.  I never really got the whole...  It's interesting though.  Sammy and Queens.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen,  I've been a listener  of you guys  since day one 
[02:09:00]  at NEW.  It's time to write a book.  Well,  if we had a real agent,  that would have been  done years ago.  Yeah,  I mean,  there's so much shit  that I didn't really know about  until now  with Clear Channel  and all that.  You guys  can really put  a good book together.  That's all I got to say.  We're working on it  on our own  because our agent  has dropped the ball  on that  and many other things.  So,  yeah,  we'll see what happens.  We were close  to an actual deal.  We were very close  to an actual deal.  It's kind of just  sitting on a table  right now.  Yeah,  but let me tell you, 
[02:09:30]  it'll be a really good read,  let me tell you.  All right.  Thank you, Sammy.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Bye.  There's so much shit  we should be doing  with our names  in this show  that just isn't  getting done  at this point.  Video.  Anyway,  so that's that.  All right.  Going down that road again.  Speaking of the FCC,  we haven't even done  the Family Guy stuff yet.  All right.  The Family Guy show  about the FCC  and Peter Griffin  starting his own network  because he was sick  of the FCC.  Cracking down on television.  Did you guys see this episode?  And we'll get blue in 
[02:10:00]  in a second.  We got Keith the Cop.  We got lots of shows  still to do here.  I like when, like,  people ask us questions, though.  I'm the guy  that's always asking.  I did not know.  I'm the guy  that's always asking questions.  It's nice that  someone asked me a question.  I just didn't know  how deep it was cutting.  I didn't know.  Who knew?  Who goddamn knew, man?  We all do suffer,  but I just didn't know.  I knew when I first came back,  O was like,  hmm.  Nah, but then,  nah, I mean,  I got to stick up  for myself, too.  Coming back to radio  was the worst timing  ever for me  because my pops died 
[02:10:30]  less than a month  before I did my first show.  Oh, okay, okay.  Well, maybe a little  more than a month,  and it's just like,  what?  And he was like,  he was everything to me,  like a friend,  a father.  He was the biggest fan  of the fucking show.  He was going through  hard shit  and would call the show  from an ambulance  in the old days.  Oh, shit,  I didn't know that.  Oh, yeah,  he was the man,  so then...  I thought it was all over  a girl and the radio.  I was like,  ah, pick yourself up,  buckaroo, let's go.  There was a bunch of things,  and then, yeah,  the pops and my mom  were in a horrific car accident 
[02:11:00]  like a month before  we started up again.  Right, right.  And I lost him,  and it was like,  ah, fuck.  Dude, I called it in  for the first four months.  I don't even remember  what we did the first four months.  No fucking idea.  Yeah, so you're feeling  how much percentage  are you guys feeling  right now?  In terms of...  This show?  Relative to your highest point  in the past  and your highest point now.  I will debate this  with anyone who wants  to debate this.  This show is so much better  than the commercial radio show.  So much better. 
[02:11:30]  The only aspect,  I think,  that's lacking a little bit  is some of the...  The craziness.  Craziness as far as,  you know,  everyone brings up  that fucking 55-gallon drum thing  and voyeur bus,  things like that.  But they don't remember  that that shit was happening  a good year  after we were at NEW.  We were playing fucking music  and just trying to,  you know,  get a few words in edgewise  to even talk  for the first year  we were over there.  People just remember it  like it was insane craziness  every day,  24 hours a day over there.  How long were you over there? 
[02:12:00]  How long were you still there?  We were there for what,  four years?  Were we there for four years?  Yeah.  We had a three-year deal  and then we did a year  out of our other deal.  We signed up three years.  But the first year we were there,  it was music,  we were a rock station.  So you feel back to normal  and better.  Well, definitely, yeah.  All right, all right.  As far as our talk show goes  and the Opie and Anthony show  goes like this,  yeah, so much better.  It's so much easier  to be able to converse naturally,  not have to worry about  fitting so many commercials in,  you have to stop talking 
[02:12:30]  in the middle of something  because commercials  got to be played,  you can't talk about it  because you got to work your way  around the language.  That shit is fantastic.  And then the old show,  man, we just ran out  of shit to do.  Yeah.  We have a much better  behind-the-scenes staff  that is bringing a lot of stuff  to the table every day.  But we're looking for...  So we don't feel like  we're struggling.  I mean, I can't tell you  the last time,  this is the worst thing  as far as a radio guy  sitting in my seat.  When this show is struggling,  it is brutal.  And sometimes they don't  notice it out there.  Yeah, you have no idea. 
[02:13:00]  I mean, we got the flop sweat  and everything.  Like, holy shit.  You're hanging on  by your nails.  We got an hour and a half to go  and we ran out of shit  to talk about.  You're juggling,  hanging on by your fingernails  and somehow shit comes  out of your mouth  so the people at home  are hearing a show.  You know, but you're here...  Luigi's.  Yeah.  We did that already?  What the fuck  are we talking about?  Pizza Hut.  Pizza Hut.  Oh, man, dude.  And then you start  digging up old bits  to just get to the end  of the show.  That's just the nature  of the beast  and, you know,  the way it was,  especially back then. 
[02:13:30]  But, you know,  you live and learn  and we've got people in place  and things in place  that give us material.  Years went by, Jack.  Yeah.  It's a whole new game.  But with things like  the homeless shopping spree  that we want to do...  That's coming back.  And, you know,  we've been here a year.  Got a listener base going  that we can start  to exploit  for other wacky things  that we've done in here.  Were you happy  about the Halloween turnout?  Yeah, that was very cool.  Yeah, absolutely.  We got our power back. 
[02:14:00]  And it just goes up from here.  All right.  So the Family Guy,  the FCC episode was great.  Peter Griffin,  sick of what was on TV  so he decided to, like,  you know,  start his own network.  I mostly want to play  the FCC song,  but here's a clip  from Family Guy.  Oh, Lois,  you are so full of...  What?  No, I can't say...  My own...  House?  Great, Lois.  Just...  Great.  You know,  you're lucky you're good at...  Mike,  or I'd never put up with you.  You know what I'm talking about.  When you're lubed up 
[02:14:30]  toothpaste in my...  on a cherry,  Episcopalian,  extension cord,  wetness,  with a parking ticket,  that is the best.  You could almost read his lips, too,  as he was talking.  One of the all-time greatest shows  going on.  Yeah, I can't get enough  of Family Guy.  I laugh at Stewie like a girl.  Yeah.  It's just...  That Deadman Fallen,  that dude,  that self-made,  he makes me goddamn laugh.  And they're not worried  about being PC  or not worried about the FCC.  But that other kid from that show 
[02:15:00]  who plays the son,  the voice of the son,  who plays the son  on Austin Powers.  Oh, yeah.  Seth Green.  That's my favorite character,  by the way.  He has the...  He has a show called...  Chicken...  Robot Chicken.  It's funny, dude.  It's a funny...  Another crazy-ass show.  We had him in  talking about that,  and I still...  It's like,  when is it on?  Puppets...  Yeah, you never know  when it's on.  It's just like...  There's so much shit on now,  you can't find anything.  I'll do a little DVR thing  and start recording  Robot Chicken.  Oh, my God.  Family Guy is just  goddamn funny.  Yeah.  I don't know how inside this is. 
[02:15:30]  So the Family Guy  does an FCC song.  You know,  the FCC has pretty much  wrecked radio.  That's why satellite radio  is just completely  taken off.  They played right into  our hands,  which is nice.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Nice, because we're here now.  So, here's the FCC song.  They will clean up  all you're talking  in a manner such as this.  They will make you  take a tinkle  when you wanna  take a piss.  And they'll make you  call fellatio  a trouser-friendly kiss.  Here's the playing situation. 
[02:16:00]  There's no negotiation  with the fellas  at the freakin' FCC.  They're as stuffy  as the stuffiest  of special interest groups.  Make a joke about your bowels  and they order in the troops.  Any baby with a brain  could tell them  everybody poops.  Take a tip,  take a lesson.  You'll never win by lesson  with the fellas  at the freakin' FCC.  And if you find yourself  with some young sexy ding, 
[02:16:30]  you're gonna have to  do her with your ding-a-ling.  Guys, you can't say penis.  So they sent this little warning.  They're prepared to do their worst.  And they stuck it in your mailbox  hoping you could be coerced.  I can think of quite another place  they should've stuck it first.  They may just be neurotic  or possibly psychotic.  They're the fellas  at the freakin' FCC. 
[02:17:00]  How great is that?  They do the uncensored version  with a DVD.  And that dude, he's all three voices.  You know that, right?  Yeah, he does.  He does everybody.  Just about, yeah.  Oh, man.  What a great show.  He does the dog.  He does Peter.  And who else?  Now, what keeps the FCC...  Oh, silly.  That's right.  What keeps FCC  from having domain  over this thing here?  I don't know.  They do.  They do.  But I don't know.  Disclaimers?  It's on.  What time is it on?  Nine.  Nine?  I don't know. 
[02:17:30]  I think...  They'll probably jump down their throat.  Give them enough time.  Yeah.  Let them really get on the radar.  Let groups really start  fucking with them.  This next clip  is just absolutely brilliant  because we dealt with this  on a regular basis.  Like, as soon as someone  complains about a radio show,  one fucking person  than management  gets up your ass.  Yeah.  And I...  You can show them ratings  that millions of people  are listening to your show.  But one person can bitch.  I've had this argument  behind closed doors  with so many program directors, 
[02:18:00]  general managers,  even the big guy, Mel.  I'm like,  one fucking complaint letter  and you're shutting down  our show, basically,  making us do something else.  I'm like,  what about all the people  that are enjoying this?  Why are you kidding  to one stupid...  Hates, Mel.  It's the boxy states,  dude.  I'm telling you.  One creepy lady says...  I don't know.  I was offended.  Yeah.  It's over all the...  My children.  Sociopaths need to start 
[02:18:30]  supporting on that level.  They just enjoy.  Like, you know,  some truck driver,  he's driving,  he's like,  this is great, man.  I like this shit.  But he's not going  to write a letter.  He's not going to even  write a letter  if they take it off.  Nah.  He's not going to go,  I enjoyed this show  and now it's gone.  That's one way...  That's really one way  we can fight back.  Will that ever happen?  I doubt it.  You know what?  They do get one or two  letters when that happens,  but those get thrown away.  They get one or two  complaint letters  and they take it like,  oh, well...  I'm not even talking 
[02:19:00]  about the FCC.  I'm talking about these...  Let's talk about  regular radio.  These companies,  you know,  they're the ones  that are a bunch of pussies.  They know that  what their host said  isn't that bad  and they're not going  to get fined by the FCC,  but they get all scared  by one stupid letter.  One stupid letter.  It always kills me.  Why would...  Why would any...  If I was Pepsi  or Coca-Cola,  right,  how would I be scared  of somebody...  Like, they go,  don't...  If you play that,  we're...  Mothers...  Oh, boycotting.  Mothers of big head 
[02:19:30]  retarded kids  are going to boycott.  It's like,  bitch,  I'm Pepsi.  Yeah.  Oh, let me tell you something.  Drink Kool-Aid, bitch.  You can never destroy Pepsi.  You can never...  That's like saying  to an electric company,  we're going to use candles.  Oh, really?  Really?  Really?  You're going to stop  using electricity?  Go fuck yourself.  Here, I dare you  to stop drinking Pepsi.  Exactly.  I don't know why  they get so scared  of the boycott.  I own 7-Up.  I own Squirt.  Get out of my face.  They get petrified  of boycotting.  And that's the real danger  because everyone goes,  FCC, FCC, FCC.  Now it's the other people  in charge  at these TV stations 
[02:20:00]  and radio stations  that throw their own morality  into it and stuff.  It's like, dude,  that has nothing to do  with the FCC.  What are you doing?  It's because psychos  on the enjoyment in.  If they don't like it,  they're going to go,  this sucks.  They're going to type in.  They're going to call in  and go, you suck.  But they're not going  to write and go,  listen, I want to keep  my O&A on.  Any W guys,  they did do  the message board thing.  They kept that alive, man,  and going and all that. 
[02:20:30]  But it's like,  not with the fervor  of these people  that want you off.  That's right.  Well, listen to this clip  from Family Guy.  Gentlemen,  we got 20 calls  about the David Hyde Pierce  incident.  And as you know,  one call equals  a billion people,  which means 20 billion  people were offended  by this.  That's an FCC guy.  That's their logic.  Absolutely their logic.  Because the reality  is not many people  complained about  the John Jackson incident.  They just didn't.  No.  They really didn't. 
[02:21:00]  And it was notorious.  I think it was  white boy black titties.  White boy black titties.  Yeah, people don't remember  that Justin was part  of that anymore.  Yeah.  White boy black boobs.  And finally,  from Family Guy.  This must be the FCC  overreacting to the  David Hyde Pierce incident.  They're censoring anything  that might be viewed  as unpleasant.  What the hell?  They let Sarah Jessica  Parker's face on TV  and she looks like a foot.  She is maybe 
[02:21:30]  the ugliest sexy woman  on the planet Earth.  Dude, you know,  this is another story.  The old listeners  got to bear with us  because we got to  tell Patrice, man.  Because we do have  a lot of new listeners  and they're joining  the program every day.  We called out  Sarah Jessica Parker  on our old show  and we basically said  that she looks like  Ruth Buzzy in a dress.  She absolutely does, dude.  She looks so much  like Ruth Buzzy  it's scary, right?  Like Ruth Buzzy's daughter.  So she was like  hosting some kind  of an award show.  It was MTV, 
[02:22:00]  I think the Music Awards  or something.  Yeah, and so we get  on the next day  and we do what we do best  and we're saying,  man, she is just ugly.  Why are people looking  at her like she's  a sex symbol?  She looks like  Ruth Buzzy in a dress  and then we're saying  how she looks like  a horse and all this shit  and all of a sudden  I see on the phones  online, whatever,  eight, Sarah  from New York.  I'm like,  and then someone's like,  that's Sarah Jessica Parker.  I'm like, yeah,  like she's listening  to our show.  We popped the phone down.  It's Sarah Jessica Parker  calling us out.  Do you have that? 
[02:22:30]  It is hilarious  because then,  I think there's one reason  why people love us  and hate us.  All of a sudden  we turn into  the biggest fucking pussies  right in front of her eyes.  She was like,  you know,  you guys on radio  got to understand  that we're out there  and we are listening  and we have feelings  and you know.  It was the crew  from like Sex and the Life.  Let's be honest, baby.  Now,  the Gap fired her  because of  they finally was like,  somebody finally was just like,  this bitch looks like a horse.  She's not pretty.  It was the crew 
[02:23:00]  in the makeup truck  or whatever.  They were fans of the show  and they just had it on  while she was getting her makeup.  She heard it live  and said,  fuck that.  Give me the phone.  Got so pissed.  Oh, you two didn't just go,  hey, baby.  I don't know how Ferris Bueller  is fucking you.  You look like Ferris Bueller.  And then we...  You're like Bueller Ferris.  Then she's like,  I bet you guys  don't look like models  and she invites us  down to the set.  So then Aunt and I  were going to do  some hacky radio bit  and we were going to send  like fucking models  down with one  or two guys down there. 
[02:23:30]  But then we were going  to go down ourselves,  right?  And then all of a sudden,  you know,  they're like,  all right,  we'll set this up  and then,  you know,  the big blow off.  The biggest difference is  we're not going out  on a nightly basis  trying to come off  like we're sex symbols.  Like I don't get dressed up  and go out to all these things  and play myself off  like I'm the hottest  fucking thing.  She's playing off  that stupid Sex and the City show.  Holy shit.  There's only one  that's marginally hot.  She's the one  with the dark hair.  The marginally, 
[02:24:00]  like normally.  Marginally,  if it's not a close up.  The one that fucked  Blair Underwood  is atrocious.  That fucking,  what's her name?  The old one.  And then,  wait a minute,  you know what?  Kim Cattrall.  Kim Cattrall is,  because she's such a  dirtbag-ish kind of girl,  she can get over  a little bit.  No.  Not even?  No.  Don't even give it to her.  Who?  She is,  the dirtbag one,  the one,  the filthy one.  Absolutely not.  The character on that  fucking show,  the way she plays it,  and I've seen  maybe two parts 
[02:24:30]  of maybe a couple  of episodes.  I've never watched  the show.  Every time I see her,  she's coming off  like she's doing  a favor.  Like she's this  fucking sexy,  I'm fucking  everything that moves.  Meanwhile,  it's like,  they're throwing you  the bone,  poochie.  You know.  They're throwing you  the fucking bone.  I had five cocks  in me last night  and it was wonderful.  That's like,  you know,  it's like a no-brainer,  dude.  It's not that you can't,  you know, 
[02:25:00]  the media cannot  make that girl,  you know.  And then you go,  how's magic?  This is why I think  a lot of these dudes  is gay.  And that's,  you know,  quote-unquote,  I'm not saying  Maddie Brothers is gay,  but whatever.  Right, right.  I'm saying that  it's like that dude,  it's like she looks  like his mother.  It's like,  no, Ferris,  you're not,  uh-uh,  no.  No war games,  that's not your woman.  Right.  Something's bullshit  going on there.  But,  no,  they've been hooked up.  They've been,  beard maybe.  They've been doing it  for a while,  who knows.  Oh,  that's hilarious.  All right,  you guys want a break, 
[02:25:30]  you want to keep moving?  Uh,  it depends on what we,  what we got over there.  Well.  Is it something easy  to change gears into  or do we have to  double clutch this motherfucker?  No,  we'll move on.  I love when we talk  about that shit though.  Yeah.  We still have a lot of  anger to get out.  We're getting better though.  We're getting better.  That's why we'll never  give Howard a break  by the way,  never.  We'll expose him  for the hypocrite he is.  that's why when you watch  that fantasy movie,  Private Parts,  and you see,  uh,  how,  uh,  he was treated so poorly 
[02:26:00]  by management,  so poorly by Imus,  who,  uh,  there's that scene  where he goes up  to Imus' dressing room  and Imus says,  he says,  fuck off.  And that was,  and that's the reason  why Howard was so,  like,  bitter toward Imus.  What a load of shit  that is.  Howard did more  behind the scenes  to fuck with our careers  than Imus ever,  ever did to him.  On the air,  off the air,  anything.  Ever.  Get Ben in here  to tell the Tony,  uh,  Baradini story. 
[02:26:30]  We were,  uh,  we were on the red carpet  for the MTV Music Awards  or the Video Awards?  Music Awards.  Video Music Awards,  yeah.  Music Awards,  right,  we had prime location.  This was part of our deal,  too,  because we're like,  you guys just don't  treat us right,  you know,  so they give us,  like,  the red carpet,  we're,  we're there,  we got our own section,  all the,  the rest of the press  was in a huge bullpen,  right?  We were doing interviews.  We were doing interviews,  it was in our contract,  so,  so,  you know,  Viacom owned MTV  and our show  and Infinity Broadcasting,  you know,  was putting on the shindig.  Yeah, 
[02:27:00]  we're working for the company  that's putting on  the fucking MTV Music Awards.  So we,  uh,  so we're done with our show,  and we got tickets  for the event.  First time I got to go to the,  and the only time,  actually,  the MTV Video Music Awards.  It was amazing,  right?  Which was definitely cool.  And,  uh,  the company that we worked for  had a VIP area  where you,  you go in,  you drink for free,  you eat.  And it's all the program directors  and general managers  of,  like,  these stations that we're on.  Right.  You know,  up in Boston.  Right.  So then,  um, 
[02:27:30]  and there's,  like,  the real celebrities are in there,  the big guys that,  you can't just walk around  with the common folks.  So you're like,  holy shit,  we're gonna get to,  like,  meet some real shit.  Hobnob.  Hobnobbing.  And to this day,  we get,  you know,  all starry-eyed for that shit.  Cahooting.  Right.  So we go to the door,  like,  uh,  OP,  and,  uh,  yeah,  you better,  uh,  yeah,  you better watch Blue there.  Is your homeless guy running off?  Your homeless guy's wandering around.  Yeah,  he's talking in a second.  So we go to the,  we go to the,  the door,  there's a,  kind of a bouncer there. 
[02:28:00]  We're thinking nothing of it,  of this,  this area,  so Anthony,  it was me and Anthony,  I think Ben,  and a couple of our guys,  a little entourage,  kind of a little entourage of the OP and Anthony show.  We walk up to the door,  I'm like,  yep,  I'm OP from the OP and Anthony show,  feeling good about ourselves,  just had a great broadcast,  right?  All of a sudden,  the guy knew we were coming,  without a doubt.  He didn't even have to look twice.  He goes,  um,  you can't come in here.  Yeah.  I'm like,  what? 
[02:28:30]  What do you mean?  We work for the,  OP and Anthony,  you know,  ask somebody,  we work for the companies,  assuming maybe,  you know,  the theater,  that this thing was in,  maybe it was one of their guys.  He goes,  oh no,  I know who you are,  and you're not allowed in here.  I'm like,  what?  Wasn't it that we were at the elevator,  and we saw Howard,  and his girlfriend at the elevator?  Well,  that's,  Keith,  you stink at telling radio stories.  I gotta tell you,  that's the punchline.  I thought that was before the fact.  No.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Not the first time that's happened on this program. 
[02:29:00]  With me?  Huh?  Me?  I think we've all done it.  All right.  Sorry,  Keith.  You do a lot for the show.  I apologize.  And by all,  I mean everybody but me.  I'm sorry.  So wait,  I'm still...  You brought the homeless guy in,  so I'm sorry.  That's right.  I'm trying to be nicer.  I'm sorry,  Keith.  So they don't let you in,  but...  No,  listen.  So then I go,  we get...  Well,  Ben,  I think,  knew that Tony Berardini,  the GM of BCM,  one of our stations,  was in there.  So I go,  I think Ben talked to the guy, 
[02:29:30]  I go,  could you get Tony Berardini out here?  No,  no,  no,  no.  They let me go,  and they wouldn't let you go.  Oh,  you actually went in,  and the guy held Ben's wallet.  But it was like,  it was like for two seconds,  you could go in if the guy holds Ben's wallet.  Like,  it was this big fucking thing.  Well,  because we weren't allowed in at all,  so I'm like,  well,  all right,  now I remember.  Look how bitter we are.  Yeah,  I go,  yeah,  you got to heal,  baby.  Dude,  this is bullshit.  You got to heal,  baby.  This is bullshit.  Get it out.  We were living love,  nigga.  We were told we were the heir of parents,  when he finally retires,  you get the kingdom,  and you're our second best show 
[02:30:00]  in the whole fucking company,  kiss,  kiss,  kiss.  Inclusion.  Yeah.  So Ben is allowed to go in there,  because now we're looking for someone to see,  what the fuck is this about?  And you grab Tony Berardini,  right?  The old GM of BCN,  he comes running out like frazzled.  Guys,  guys,  guys,  guys.  Guys,  Howard's in there,  and he's fucking freaking out,  and he's scratching his head.  Like what?  Like you're going to fuck him up?  Dude,  who knows?  Didn't want us in there.  Who the fuck knows?  The place was huge.  It wasn't like we were in a little studio like this. 
[02:30:30]  Dude,  the sharks are here.  Howard,  do do do do do do.  Dude,  so get the barracudas.  Barracudas assemble.  Dude,  it was like mezzanine level.  Yeah,  it was pretty much the whole mezzanine of the place,  or half of it.  It wasn't even like we were going to bump into each other.  Tony comes out,  who had a lot of power at Infinity at this point.  He's shaking.  He looks like a crockhead,  man.  He's like freaking out,  runs out,  dude,  dude,  dude,  Howard's in there.  He's freaking out.  You guys can't come in.  You've got to understand.  On what level?  You've got to understand.  That pussy did not want us back there. 
[02:31:00]  Freaking out on what level?  That he did not want us in the same room as him at this big event.  It was his fucking time to shine.  And us scumbags weren't going to be in the same fucking room as him.  We worked for the same fucking company.  But you weren't looking for no shine.  You was kind of just going in and going,  I'm at the MTV.  Look around,  right?  Dude,  that's all.  Exactly.  That's all.  Grab a drink.  But this paranoid fuck thinks it's always all about him.  Like,  we could give a flying fuck he's in there.  I want to just go back there and, 
[02:31:30]  you know,  check it out.  As a newbie.  Go back and see what it's all about.  But this paranoid all about him fuck is like,  no.  As a newbie and supposedly a very important part of the company.  And Mel Karmazin was back there.  And he's the head muckety-muck of fucking Viacom at the time.  So there was no way that his boy,  Howie,  was going to tell him something.  He wasn't going to do it.  And he wasn't allowed to even tell this story at that time.  No.  No.  No.  So this was gag all the time.  Yeah.  So the next day we can't even.  Now we're like.  You can't even.  Now we're pissed and can't even talk about it.  Can you imagine how great that radio would have been that day?  Like,  you guys are not even going to believe what fucking happened to us. 
[02:32:00]  I didn't even have a show that day.  You had to be salted up.  So when people say,  why fucking,  you know,  you motherfuckers are obsessed.  You guys are so pissed at Howard.  Why?  What?  It,  and that's just one in a number of behind the scenes,  little fucking things this pussy did to fuck us over.  Right.  The hypocrite that he is that he,  then he gets on the air and talks about,  ah,  Billy Crystal ran away from stuttering John while he was trying to do an interview.  But what's the matter,  Billy,  you pussy?  What,  you can't take a few questions?  Shit like that would go on in the behind the scenes. 
[02:32:30]  He's fucking calling it.  Our boss is constantly on our ass because he's like,  guys,  how many fucking calls do I got to take from Howard about you guys?  Knock it off already.  We're like,  what's not going to,  what the fuck are we doing?  All I have to say is January 2nd.  Yeah.  Good.  Have fun.  Coming back from skiing very early to take a meeting where we thought we were going to get fired.  coming back from our Christmas vacation to meet with Mel Karmazin.  Holy shit.  Because we thought we were being fired because we was talking about Howard.  Because we talked about Howard and his stupid daughter. 
[02:33:00]  And his daughter and her fucking problem at the time.  So,  so then we're outside this room and Tony is freaking out like,  dude,  he's,  and all of a sudden like,  we're out there like,  what the fuck,  Tony?  Are you kidding me?  This is,  you know,  we were,  who would he tell to keep you out?  He just,  there was someone there that he could,  he could just say,  keep them out at the time.  Mel Karmazin.  No,  you were set up to go in,  right?  Yeah.  Yeah,  we didn't think anything of it.  So Mel was there for him to be said,  look,  I don't want to do it. 
[02:33:30]  The bouncer knew.  So it,  it obviously was a whole thing.  Oh,  the word was said before we,  I would love to,  I would love to name names.  I would assume it,  it's a,  it was a Mel thing.  Mel Karmazin.  You know,  because Howard talked to Mel and said,  Howard went to Mel and said,  those motherfuckers don't come in here.  And Mel said,  you're my boy.  Right.  So,  all right.  So then,  so then we're standing outside the room,  right?  Dude,  we're standing outside the room with Tony and he's just freaking out.  Cause he knows like,  we're just,  we're just dicks.  And we're just going to say something and either we're either going to try to get in the room or we'll say something stupid on the other the next day. 
[02:34:00]  So he's like,  Oh God,  I don't need these problems.  Blah,  blah,  blah.  So Howie walks out with his chick,  right?  And now,  uh,  Tony is begging,  begging me going,  please,  please don't,  don't,  don't,  please don't say anything.  And I'm like,  like,  as,  as Howie's going to the elevator,  getting to the Keith part.  And,  uh,  Tony is actually holding me back.  Yeah.  Holding my shirt.  Cause I was going to get his face and call him a fucking hypocrite.  Tony's begging me,  please, 
[02:34:30]  please,  please,  please,  just do me a favor.  Please,  please,  please.  I'll do it.  Whatever you want.  Please,  please,  please.  Does he see?  Huh?  Does he see you?  Oh,  yeah.  And,  uh,  and yes,  Joe from Raleigh,  uh,  he says,  didn't that fuckhead Howard once accused Anthony of stealing his voice?  Yeah.  He once actually got on the air and said,  and the one,  the one actually stole my voice.  He uses my voice.  Like,  not even like I'm doing an impression of it.  He thinks my voice was his voice.  But he never,  he never acknowledged you as Opie and Anthony. 
[02:35:00]  He just,  he called you guys or those.  Not until the day we got,  fired and could not then talk about.  Right.  When,  when we finally didn't have a,  uh,  platform.  Right.  Then it was Opie and Anthony,  Opie and Anthony,  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony,  Opie and Anthony,  Opie and Anthony,  fucked the company.  Opie and Anthony did this.  They blew it.  Opie and Anthony,  Opie and Anthony,  Opie and Anthony,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah.  And I'm glad,  uh,  who was it?  David Hinckley?  Or was it,  uh,  from the post?  Monelli that pointed out what a fucking back down pussy Howard is.  Yeah.  Uh,  in the paper. 
[02:35:30]  They had some kind of meeting with,  uh,  Joel Hollander.  And never,  never at one,  has it ever been one time where,  where it all,  where he,  he,  he,  he met up with you guys,  where it was like,  he,  he actually,  it was going to be ahead.  It was going to be a,  a pay-per-view.  No,  he avoided,  he avoided all contact with us.  I did it behind the scenes.  Quit,  we've told this story too many times,  so I want to just brush over it,  but he was doing a press conference for Son of the Beach  when it came,  when it was coming to television,  doing a press conference down at some hotel, 
[02:36:00]  where was it?  It was a plaza.  I mean,  the old tiger never just came out and just goes,  never.  You pussy mother,  you know what I am.  That old tiger,  we got press credentials,  we got press credentials,  we just wanted to go down there and see the press conference.  We had just gotten to New York,  we just started to get a little bit of a buzz going,  and we had our press credentials,  so we went down to the press conference,  which was happening before our show aired,  to see Howard deliver his press conference for Son of the Beach.  We get down there,  people start looking at us,  they're talking,  and blah,  blah,  blah,  and security comes over and tells us we have to leave.  We have to fucking leave his fucking press conference. 
[02:36:30]  This,  by the way,  was the same day that that Billy Crystal thing happened on his show,  where he bitched out Billy Crystal because Stuttering John wasn't standing there and taking his questions.  We weren't going to do anything.  Swear to Christ,  we were just going to sit there and look at the press conference.  I know you want to brush over this story,  but I don't care.  I can tell this story ten times,  it makes me laugh,  and I know listeners,  it makes them laugh every time.  So,  Ant and I,  we're in the back row.  We're sitting there waiting for the press conference.  It's supposed to start at,  let's say,  noon,  okay?  And they have little finger sandwiches.  So we get a nice little plate of finger sandwiches and a pickle, 
[02:37:00]  and we're thinking no one even knows we're here,  right?  We're just in the back minding our own fucking business.  The real problems were in the front row.  We had three other guys in the front row.  That's Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark,  and other guys that really would have done something.  So we're sitting there,  and I'm talking to Anthony like,  what the,  man,  this press conference is,  it's supposed to have started.  No,  it's now 12,  I wonder why the delay,  you know?  I'm wondering why the delay.  Then all of a sudden I see one of Howard's guys,  I guess,  notices we're there,  and runs out of the room. 
[02:37:30]  Little did we know at the time,  Howard was in a limo outside the plaza,  sitting and waiting.  He was sitting in his limo,  wouldn't come in the fucking building,  waiting for us,  until we were thrown out.  Waiting for us to get kicked out.  This is another fact,  okay?  So then,  but Billy Crystal's a pussy,  for not standing there,  and taking,  stuttering John's questions.  That same day,  he's like,  what's the matter Billy?  You're a pussy,  you can't take it,  you can't stand,  there he is,  Howard,  going to his own press conference,  wouldn't fucking walk in the building,  until we were thrown out.  So next thing you know, 
[02:38:00]  it's now like 12,  20,  and all of a sudden a guy comes up to us,  who's a huge fan,  and I guess he's one of the security guys,  at this event,  he goes,  dude,  I'm a huge fan of your show.  You guys aren't going to do anything,  are you?  Because now there's a buzz.  I'm like,  no,  and I go,  no man,  we're just here to have some food,  and check it out,  right?  He goes,  okay,  okay,  I just had a check.  I'm like,  alright,  that's that.  We're thinking nothing of it.  More people start looking at us,  I'm like,  oh boy.  Next thing you know,  a huge security guard comes up to us,  and goes,  you guys have to leave.  I'm like,  what do you mean?  We got invited,  here's our press credentials? 
[02:38:30]  No,  you guys got to leave now,  and now he's really going to get,  like,  kind of rough with us,  and so we stand like,  well,  you know,  we're not going to cause a scene,  but at this point,  everyone is turning around.  Now we're getting escorted,  out of the park plaza,  with all these publicists,  and these people in suits.  Are you guys yelling out,  oh,  we're just throwing out!  Oh,  no,  no,  no,  no,  we were all good.  We've been throwing out!  We were good boys.  You just left.  We were good infinity boys,  because,  uh,  well,  yeah,  yeah,  because we're working for the same company.  And we knew we would have gotten,  uh,  well,  like,  what the fuck is this about?  So,  as we're walking out, 
[02:39:00]  everyone has their arms folded,  like Howard's people,  and the publicists and stuff,  they have their arms folded,  like,  how dare you?  Yeah.  I'm like,  what?  Like,  we were the scum of the earth,  right?  And it wasn't until we left  that the faggot got out of his fucking limo,  and got in,  and did his press conference late.  We walked right past his,  uh,  his limo that was parked right in front of the plaza.  He was in there.  In there,  calling his pussy.  When we got back to the studio.  You think at that point,  at least,  like,  uh,  you know,  show some bravery.  You know what I would have did? 
[02:39:30]  Like,  a godfather.  Just to piss you off.  Roll the window down.  Yeah.  Wait back to him,  roll it back up.  Just to,  just to,  hey.  Got you out of there,  motherfucker.  Good kids.  Good kids there.  When we got back to the studio,  Ken Stevens,  our general manager,  our boss,  this is what we found out after the fact.  had told us that Howard was in the limo calling him.  He was just taking calls from him saying,  what the fuck are those two doing here at my press conference?  Screaming.  Get them out of here.  I'll have,  you know,  I'll have you fired.  I'm,  I'm calling fucking Mel.  What the fuck are they doing down here? 
[02:40:00]  And Ken's freaking out about the whole thing.  Thinking we're going to do anything.  Sent Jeremy sprinting down there.  Yeah.  On his little feminine legs.  Sprinting down there,  uh,  to,  to get us,  tell us to leave.  His little real legs,  yeah.  Just fucking running to get us.  Out of the situation.  Like,  what the fuck is the big deal?  Yeah.  And never did he do a Bernard Hopkins.  Just like,  all right,  all right,  youngsters.  Let me,  let me show you something.  He's a big,  brave guy on the air when it's someone like John DiBella,  when it's someone like those other two clowns from California that he got, 
[02:40:30]  Mark and Brian,  anyone he battles on the air and then goes,  these pussies,  they don't want to fight because their program director says the best way to deal with Howard is just to ignore him.  Well,  we weren't ignoring him.  Uh,  we were facing him,  uh,  head to head.  We shared a lot of the same fans and people really started thinking,  Hmm,  this guy is coming off like an asshole.  And the second that happened behind the scenes,  this motherfucker,  every turn would try to fuck us.  And that's why we,  uh,  can't stand them.  That's right. 
[02:41:00]  And we'll never back down.  It's not because,  you know,  it's Howard.  Why do you hate him?  He's Howard.  No,  there's plenty of good reasons.  Believe me.  We lived it.  He did a good job.  I'm not going to be a hold back.  I'm not going to deny.  I was a huge fan growing up and,  and before I got into radio and when I was in radio,  I thought it would be kind of cool,  especially working for infinity broadcasting.  That's like,  you know,  dream come true.  So if you was to write the,  uh,  you know,  uh,  private,  whatever private ONA.  Yeah.  There would be a scene where Howard's treating you guys like shit, 
[02:41:30]  like the Don Imus.  Exactly.  Only it would be true.  And it would be 10 times worse than just saying,  fuck off and slamming the door.  There you go.  Yeah.  It would be us coming home from Christmas fucking vacation to be yelled at by  Mel Karmazin because how we made one phone call.  And,  uh,  we'll end this with,  um,  the post today.  Someone reminded me that John Minnelli,  a good friend of ours.  Yeah.  The headline today,  Stern limps back on air.  Ooh,  what happened?  He did a fake suspension and,  uh,  he pretty much got caught doing a fake suspension.  Yeah.  He basically took election day off and, 
[02:42:00]  uh,  they,  they try to do the oldest trick in the book,  you know,  uh,  let's get some attention.  So they get some press.  They got it.  Hey,  they did a fake,  uh,  a fake suspension,  which,  which is just showing a little desperation in my opinion.  And,  uh,  so Minnelli wrote about it and the headline is Stern limps back on air.  Howard Stern buckled,  caved in,  wimped out Stern back yesterday from a one day suspension from talking too much about his upcoming satellite radio gig,  acted like a whipped puppy while discussing a rowdy lunch with,  with his bosses on Monday. 
[02:42:30]  Then when we played,  uh,  after he announced his divorce,  Allison,  and we played Allison with him crying,  one of the best,  Corky,  Corky Stern.  Ooh,  ooh,  ooh,  ooh,  ooh,  Robert.  Yeah,  can we be playing Allison?  Get FedEx to throw that up on OAVirus.com.  We almost,  that was almost a firing right there too.  Many,  many,  Oh my God.  I'm like,  this guy isn't going to beat us up.  He ain't going to make us fucking look stupid.  Are you guys now,  can you,  can you tell any young upstarts?  I know you wouldn't, 
[02:43:00]  but would you tell,  could you,  could you say,  I don't want to deal with these pussies.  I tell those,  all the time I'm calling Elo about the Ron and Fez kids.  Yeah.  I don't like,  I don't like the way these young upstarts,  they're coming up and fucking with us.  Don't like it.  All right.  Wow,  that's a,  that's a hell of a tangent we just went on.  But Patrice asked.  Yeah.  We'll blame Patrice O'Neal today.  That's been,  you know,  that's,  there is a reason behind it.  I'm the material of this segment.  No,  no,  I think it's,  I think it's a very interesting segment.  I want to hear more pedophilia, 
[02:43:30]  you monkey fat nigga,  shut up.  I just want to know,  what happened to my friend?  Yeah,  not only that,  but I missed all of Carrot Top on fucking Regis.  Look at this,  swine it up nigga.  I missed all of Carrot Top on Regis.  What's he doing?  Turn him up.  Joe Piscopone up.  Crank him up.  He's got to be doing stirrucks.  That guy is so fucking buff.  Airport security is when it really gets rough.  Oh my God.  What do you get in there?  Yeah.  How do you do that?  They go through my hair,  they go through everything.  So what do you do,  Carrot Top?  This morning,  really,  literally,  it's just so you don't get burp flu. 
[02:44:00]  You wear a hat covered in cats,  so that's why we don't get burp flu.  Look,  it's a jacket,  and it's got cats on it,  and the birds stay away from him.  Oh,  that Carrot Top.  Now,  now it's too good.  Okay,  sorry.  Actually,  I met him in the lobby of the Vegas hotel we're at.  Yeah.  He knows Jimmy,  and Jimmy and I were walking through the lobby,  and,  you know,  he's a really nice guy.  He really is.  I met him years ago,  and I used to work at the door man.  It's like,  see,  he is like a nice guy.  Yeah,  that's what I've heard from everybody. 
[02:44:30]  It doesn't mean he doesn't look like a transvestite.  Right.  He doesn't look like a little orphan nanny as a man.  And if you're going to be a prop hack,  he is the most successful prop hack ever.  But you know what?  $50,000 a show,  it does.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Huge.  You know what about Carrot Top,  too?  He knows he's a prop hack.  Yeah.  That's why he's fucking built where he could just...  Like,  who's going to say,  hey,  prop hack with him?  The guy's got fucking arms.  I think that's where the workout thing started with this guy,  because he was never like that. 
[02:45:00]  Now it looks like he's on steroids,  and when we met him,  he was on the way to,  like,  a Gold's Gym or something.  That guy knew that he was a prop hack,  and said,  I need to protect myself.  He only works out.  You think he's on the road knocking,  knocking traditional motherfuckers out?  He's like,  let me tell you something.  Richard Pryor will be turning over in his eventual grave  if you don't stop...  What?  Hold on,  hold on,  hold on.  Hold my Domino's pizza jacket that I created.  Why not put this nigga in his mouth?  Come on.  Come on.  He takes his shirt off.  He puts his red hair in a ponytail.  What do you have to say about my props now? 
[02:45:30]  Now what, bitch?  Now what?  You know,  like my fireman hat?  He's fucking working out  or screwing roller skates on toilet bowls seats.  What?  That's what he does his whole career.  Hold on,  hold on,  hold on,  hold on.  Hold on.  Hold my hula hoop with Raisin Blaze on it.  That's right.  Because I'm going to knock this dude in his mouth.  Speaking of enemies,  Anthony,  we'll end this segment by saying  the arch enemy will be revealed tomorrow.  Oh,  a lot of speculation,  not only on the message boards,  but in the news, 
[02:46:00]  in the trades.  Yeah.  Everyone's chiming in.  Yes.  XM has hired one of our arch enemies.  That's official.  And what this person will do for us,  we'll see.  Do they have connections with General Motors?  The secret person?  But the arch enemy will be revealed tomorrow.  This has been an ongoing little soap opera on the show.

Opie takes off with some dialogue.  I can type in a quick VIN number.  I'm getting a door.  You would think the guy would go,  wait,  why don't you call me after the show?  No.  You guys are busy.

That was the rage.  That was what happened on that train. 
[02:51:00]  Oh,  my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train.  We saw it.  He was out of his mind.  You know what,  Todd,  we were talking about Rain Man,  and when you were watching Rain Man,  remember,  it was kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go,  not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff,  but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport.  Oh,  yeah.  Just like,  just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was,  that was,  that was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster,  and a little smoke blowing up,  and he couldn't handle it.  Right. 
[02:51:30]  Imagine that.  You didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just walked.  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  You have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony,  the virus is spreading.  Oh,  man,  we have lots of show to do still. 
[02:52:00]  We got Blue outside the studio,  a homeless guy that Keith the Cop has brought in.  We're going to be setting up the homeless shopping spree  once again this year.  We haven't done that in a few years.  But yes,  homeless shopping spree,  coming back to the Opie and Anthony program.  And Keith was telling a crazy story off air  about what goes on at night with the whack bag people.  Yeah,  you know,  I was reading the boards one day  and they were talking about this pal talk thing that they do.  Mm-hmm.  So out of curiosity, 
[02:52:30]  I signed up for pal talk.  I was curious.  I was curious.  You were being set up by Dateline.  You know that,  right?  So I go into,  they have this whack bag degenerates room.  And,  you know,  a couple guys online told me,  yeah,  you know,  some girls come in,  they wow,  you get to see it,  you know,  some nice tits.  And I said,  all right,  let me go check this out.  So anyway,  we're in there and there's a couple girls.  And now people see me come in,  they see my name,  and they start pounding me with,  you got to check out this one guy's video thing.  And I don't remember his name.  Someone will come up with an instant feedback. 
[02:53:00]  Anyway,  I click on this guy's video link.  These whack bag guys get this guy.  He's from California and he's a bisexual fella.  And he sits there and he just jams things up his ass.  And when I have it,  and when I signed on and I see his video,  he's bent over and he's got a plate of like dull pineapple slices.  Yeah.  And he's taking them, 
[02:53:30]  like he's got the ring,  his finger in the hole of the dull pineapple slices.  And he's jamming them up his ass.  Oh,  and then he turns,  he sits down with the whole thing of pineapple up his ass.  And then all these whack bag guys,  no dude,  dude,  you got to shit him out.  You got,  so he takes a plate.  They're egging him on.  Oh,  they egg him on to do.  He's got to be in his fifties.  I would think.  And supposedly he's like an engineer for Honda or something.  Like he's actually a really good job,  but he turns around and on camera,  he shits out the pineapple onto the plate and then he eats it. 
[02:54:00]  Oh,  stop.  And maybe we get,  maybe somebody can,  he did Oreos.  He did pineapple.  He did his dentures.  He took his dentures and stuffed them up his ass and then took them out and put them right back into his mouth.  That's a great gig.  It's disgusting.  Doug out,  Doug.  That would be Subray.  Subray,  correct.  Subray.  All right.  That guy absolutely rocks.  Well,  that's one way to put it. 
[02:54:30]  I got to,  you got to give me like two seconds of filler while I walk out of my office because I can't talk about that in here.  Yeah.  Hold on a second.  I'll get big A on too.  Big A for some reason has info on this.  Big A from whackbag.com.  Big A.  Hi,  Opie.  Oh boy.  Hey,  Big A.  Yeah,  P.  Hi,  Doug.  Yeah.  What do you know about this guy?  I've seen him once on Pal Talk.  Kind of weird. 
[02:55:00]  He's kind of weird.  Yeah.  That's it?  Okay,  I'm back.  All right,  Doug.  You're on with Big A as well,  so.  What's up,  Big A?  Yeah,  we have this.  You're a big A with trying to say good yourself.  It took too long.  Hey,  how you doing,  Big A?  Yeah,  nice.  How's your mother?  She,  good,  good,  good,  good.  Big A can't really speak very well.  Jesus.  All right,  so,  Big A,  you've seen this guy do this video? 
[02:55:30]  Yeah,  one time,  yeah.  And any highlights for you?  Oh my God,  Big A.  Wow.  It's big the whole alphabet.  What was he using when you were watching,  Big A?  Say something easy,  a cat or something.  Say pineapple,  it'll take too long.  Stegas,  Stegas,  Stegas.  Stegas is very hard for you.  I forgot actually.  How do you forget? 
[02:56:00]  So you,  I see it all the time.  All right,  Doug?  All right,  I'll never forget this guy.  He wanted,  basically it's like a chat room,  where you have video cameras,  and audio,  so you don't have to type everything out.  This guy kind of wanders into the room,  because it's a public room,  because he's a submissive,  and he'll do anything anybody tells him to do.  So we get him in there one night,  and he starts playing around,  shoving things in his ass. 
[02:56:30]  But it's things from like the kitchen.  Like the first night,  he took a pizza,  a slice of pizza,  and he shoved it in his ass.  Was it cold?  Was it cold?  Yeah,  I believe it was cold.  Like frozen?  Hot pizza.  I hope so.  Because sometimes you get that hot,  that hot slice of pizza,  and it burns the roof of your mouth.  The tip of the triangle in first?  Yeah,  does he roll it up?  Was it Sicilian?  Motherfucker!  What did he...  When you go for like the crust end first, 
[02:57:00]  just to get it out of the way?  I think it's just like you would eat a normal pizza.  You'd have to fold it,  and half.  That's what he did.  He folded it,  and he stuffed it in his ass.  Yeah,  yeah,  you'd have to.  Exactly,  exactly.  You've done this before?  No,  no.  He folds it in half,  and he crams it into his ass,  then he turns around,  and he shows his asshole to the camera.  Well,  you have to.  He shits it out,  and then he eats it.  And just don't ever get on radio as a dude,  and go,  this guy rocks.  Like,  either hire a girl, 
[02:57:30]  or say,  hey,  my girl saw her,  and she,  this guy rocks!  But you can't be a dude,  and go,  man,  this motherfucker shoved the pizza.  You know,  it's just the miracle of the internet.  He's some shit.  This is the information age,  the 21st century,  and this is what we have going on.  I'm going out on a whim.  A technology that,  you know,  years ago,  if you brought up the technology of the internet to people,  they'd be like,  this sounds like the most wonderful,  like,  useful thing to mankind,  the exchange of information, 
[02:58:00]  the flash of light,  the speed of light,  and,  what can we use it for?  Oh,  I'm going to shove a pizza in my ass,  and camera,  and the world's going to see it.  It introduced fetishes on such a high level.  I've seen a guy,  that to this day is amazing,  and it weirdly turned me on.  It was like two girls around 1920  that were just kicking this guy in the balls.  Just kicking him as hard as their feet could kick him in his balls.  Yeah,  he's got that fetish.  And it's just like,  I'm like, 
[02:58:30]  wow,  those girls literally look sexy  doing all type of dumb shit to this guy's balls.  It wasn't him.  It was just to get beautiful girls to do any dumb shit.  Trampling fetish,  where they wear spiked heels  and actually step on his bag  with the spiked heels.  And guys,  you know,  into this.  I never knew that was out there.  How would you?  How would anybody?  We used to have to fight for like one penthouse or a Playboy,  or if you ever got a hardcore porno magazine when you were a kid  and thumbed through it, 
[02:59:00]  it was like gold.  You would hide in the woods like a pirate hid his treasure.  You'd bury it and dig it up.  And R.  Now,  it's,  you know,  a couple of mouse clicks,  and you got the worst,  most heinous shit  that anyone could possibly...  I do not imagine.  I remember the first penetrated vagina I ever saw in picture.  It was just,  I was in eighth grade,  and I just,  and I had a,  whatever book I wasn't reading,  and I put this thing,  and it just to,  the first time I saw the name Tuna Sandwich,  I never forgot the DP.  Now it's DP.  Right.  But they called it Tuna Sandwich back then, 
[02:59:30]  and it was so weird to look at.  Like,  just penetration.  Now,  it's the internet's here,  and it's making,  you just...  That's it.  All right,  listen.  Everyone's desensitized.  We gotta move on,  because we got so much going on.  Doug,  thank you.  Thanks,  guys.  Big A.  Anytime.  Big A,  thanks.  Tune into that one.  Thank you.  All right,  there you go,  Big A.  Welcome.  Really fast.  The boys are hard at work in the O&A lab.  I caught a peak.  The lab.  They're working on a new way to assault the media. 
[03:00:00]  Oh,  good.  Where's Danny?  There it is.  They were actually practicing outside the studio in the O&A lab.  I saw you guys practicing a new technique to do the assault on the media thing, Danny.  No,  it wasn't really practice.  It was just to see how it looked in the frame.  So,  it works.  Well,  they were practicing.  They were filming it and everything to see how good it would be.  I like the idea of a sign that's a little smaller, though.  Well,  here it is.  I like the idea that it's not so big where you're only going to see half of whatever it  is when you get behind a news person with it.  That's pretty good. 
[03:00:30]  It's an O&A hanky.  That's pretty much what that is.  There's a major problem with that.  You know that,  right?  Yeah,  I know.  There's no XM on that.  Yeah,  you got to put the XM.  Right,  we're just checking it for size right now.  I think it's got to be a little bit bigger.  Oh,  that's just a sample?  Yeah,  that's just a sample.  And you got to reverse that cartoon character.  You don't need that bigger.  That's perfect.  That's perfect.  Yeah,  that's like Anthony was just saying.  You want it a little smaller.  You want the whole thing in the frame,  not just O in,  and you just want the XM symbol somewhere.  Right.  No, 
[03:01:00]  it would show up on a video.  I'm sorry.  Put XM,  switch our cartoons so it's,  you know,  Opie and Anthony kind of thing.  Okay.  Yeah,  why is that reversed?  Yeah.  I'm never on the left as you look at the picture.  Oh,  just the image that we sent over  originally had you guys like this,  so they were sent it up.  I'm always on the right.  Okay.  Because then people don't get confused.  It's Opie and Anthony,  and then in the picture,  it's Anthony and Opie.  Yeah,  they go,  which one's Opie?  Because they can't really figure out  which one looks Italian,  and the other one looks like the Opie character.  Right.  It's in your pocket.  Let's say hi to Dave Foley. 
[03:01:30]  Dave Foley,  co-creator of Kids in the Hall.  Dave.  It was on News Radio,  and now he does the Celebrity Poker Showdown  on Bravo.  Hey, Dave.  Good morning.  Hi.  Sorry I had to wait.  You know,  we had to talk about the guy  shoving stuff up.  I know.  You really wrecked my breakfast.  Especially through,  I hope you aren't having pizza for breakfast.  No,  actually,  I was having a big plate of pineapple.  I have a little Oreo cookies.  I freshly shit out.  Yeah,  it's just,  the internet's,  it's such a miracle  for what it actually is 
[03:02:00]  and what it can do  and for what it's being used for.  It's just,  I don't know.  Yeah,  well,  every medium is,  you know,  initially used for porn.  That's what they're saying about the,  um,  the printing press.  Well,  we've always heard the story  of the printing press.  It's true.  Some guy there,  some friggin',  like a monk  or something,  sitting there going,  and he fucked her.  They discovered the printing press  and it was used for writing,  uh,  dirty stories at first.  Yeah.  Yeah,  he's right.  Dave's right.  And then the,  uh,  the iPod video iPod thing,  they have downloadable,  uh,  porno clips. 
[03:02:30]  In fact,  I do believe the Gutenberg Bible  is pornographic.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had my suspicions.  Yeah.  Now,  um,  I am a huge poker fan,  Dave.  Uh-huh.  And I,  can't stand any other,  other celebrity,  like,  poker shows,  except for Celebrity Poker Showdown.  Well,  thank you.  Because,  I don't know what it is,  like,  sometimes you tune in  and they're trying to pawn off  some other celebrity thing,  and it just doesn't have,  it's not as fun,  um,  the celebrities kind of blow.  Do you,  do you pick these people 
[03:03:00]  ahead of time  on their poker prowess?  Because some of them  are pretty good.  Uh,  I think they try to get some,  something,  they try to make sure  there are some  that can play poker.  For the most part,  they can't,  and usually the ones  that can lose.  Yeah,  you guys always pick,  and they go,  my pick is gonna be,  and then it's usually  somebody that plays,  and then someone like  stupid Colin Quinn,  who,  like,  a calling station,  Yeah.  he wins.  He wound up winning.  Yes,  he did.  And someone like,  uh,  James Woods,  who,  uh,  seems to have dedicated 
[03:03:30]  his life,  uh,  to poker,  or at least talking about poker.  Haven't some of these guys  just maybe gone a little overboard?  Like,  you're,  if you're a poker player,  and you're very good at poker,  that's fine.  If you're an actor,  and you actually have a career,  and then you decide to just  pretty much give it up for poker,  that's a little odd.  Yeah,  I don't understand it.  I mean,  the guys,  there's guys here that spend,  like,  20 hours a week at the Commerce Casino.  Yeah.  Playing poker.  Just playing poker.  A couple of these guys,  uh,  yeah,  James Woods is one,  and now, 
[03:04:00]  uh,  what's her,  what's her name now?  Uh,  uh,  uh,  Tilly.  Oh,  Jennifer Tilly,  yeah.  Jennifer Tilly really took off.  Yeah.  I guess Phil Locke has,  uh,  taught her,  uh,  a couple of things.  Well,  perhaps.  Perhaps she's returned the favor.  Have you picked up anything?  Because I know you came in,  like,  you were one of the highest ranked celebrities.  Uh,  uh,  you made it further than any other celebrity in one of these,  uh,  tournaments?  I did,  uh,  yeah,  I did at the World Poker Tour Invitational.  That's the first time I ever played,  uh,  poker.  So I'd be one of those, 
[03:04:30]  uh,  celebrities who had no clue what he was doing and wound up winning.  Really?  Does it make you any better sitting there,  uh,  watching these guys play to see what works,  what doesn't?  I,  you know,  I,  I like to pride myself on learning absolutely nothing from being on the show.  Yeah.  But I've,  I have found,  like,  I've actually sat in at games a couple of times where I've realized,  oh,  wow,  I really can play better than these guys now.  Yeah.  Does Phil help you out at all?  Uh,  yeah.  Well,  you know,  just,  you know,  hearing him,  hearing him,  uh, 
[03:05:00]  you know,  rant about how badly everyone plays.  Anthony lost to Phil Gordon recently on the radio program.  Yeah.  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I,  I Roshambo'd with him here.  Uh,  and,  uh,  I,  for some reason I know he can tell what I'm going to throw before I throw it by  looking at my hand.  Did you just,  he's very,  Rochambo?  Yeah,  that's what they call it.  I call it rock,  paper,  scissors.  Rock,  paper,  scissor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what,  yeah,  that's what street tracks call it.  Yeah.  Sure.  Street tracks.  But in the, you know, outside the highlight palette. 
[03:05:30]  The high-stakes world, we call it Rochambeau.  Yeah.  And, yeah, he, like, he knew that I was going to throw a scissor.  Like, maybe my two fingers were twitching, and his eye catches it so quickly.  Yeah.  Well, you know, we did an episode of Joey, where Joey goes on the poker show.  Right.  On that show.  I forget his name.  The guy plays his friend.  I forgot his name now.  But he kept beating Phil at everything. 
[03:06:00]  Beat him at the heads-up hold'em.  Beat him at the Rock Papers.  Like, for real or for the show?  No, for real.  For real?  Like, hanging around the set.  God damn it, why can't I do that?  I sat down.  I did the celebrity poker, one of the tournaments out there at the Commerce.  And I sat down at the table.  And I'm in the Masters across from me.  And there's other people.  And I'm just like, oh, Christ, why am I at this table?  And then Phil Gordon comes and sits down and just makes me look like an idiot. 
[03:06:30]  Just a complete buffoon.  It's so intimidating when somebody that can actually play like that just...  And, you know, I play online, so occasionally you think you're good.  Yeah.  You wind up looking like a jackass.  And it doesn't help that he's 7'10".  Yeah, he's very intimidating.  Like, he just kind of...  He walks in the room.  Everyone knows he's there.  Yeah.  He's very cocky.  He comes off...  Now, the odd thing is, on the show, Celebrity Poker Showdown, he comes off as a funny kind 
[03:07:00]  of guy, which he is.  Yeah.  But when he's playing, he's, like, dead serious.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to get involved with that.  Yeah.  Well, he's got that crazy math genius kind of intensity about him when he's playing.  Yeah, he calls off his own percentages, like he knows what his odds are that he's going  to catch a hand.  It's frightening.  And he...  What was he, a rocket scientist or something?  He was, like, an internet sort of genius. 
[03:07:30]  He...  I guess he had...  He retired when he was, like, 27.  Yeah, bastard.  He had some...  He had a company he sold to Cisco Systems that helped make the internet work.  He never commented on it, but the chick's all over him or what?  Yeah, he seems to do all right.  Yeah.  This is usually the girl...  Yeah.  Women seem to be pretty into Phil.  Yeah.  Are the other kids in the hall guys working?  Huh?  Are the other kids in the hall guys working?  I think so, yeah.  You think so? 
[03:08:00]  You don't talk to them anymore?  Huh?  No, actually, they were all over at my house last weekend.  Oh, okay.  And, yeah, everybody's working.  What were you doing?  Watching football or just...  No, we were just hanging out.  They came over and we were just talking about maybe trying to do something together.  Oh, okay.  Everybody so always thought you were gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you got, like, this hot wife.  I know.  I used to think I was gay, but, you know...  Did you?  A beard?  Turned out I just don't, you know, don't like cock as much as I thought I would. 
[03:08:30]  That'll happen.  Yeah.  Well, what do you got going on here?  Well, right now, actually, if you...  Anybody in L.A. this weekend, there's a show I've co-written and directed, a theater show  that we're getting up called The Tribute at the Steve Allen Theater.  Yeah.  And, which actually stars My Beautiful Wife.  Yes. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Chrissy Guerrero.  Yeah.  Look her up on the Internet Movie Database.  She's got a couple of very pretty pictures of her on there.  Yeah.  So she's doing a show called The Tribute that I helped write and I'm directing it.  So I'm doing that right now and we're going to try and see where that goes.  And, I don't know, what am I doing?  I've been writing a lot lately.  And, of course, Celebrity Poker Showdown.  Celebrity Poker Showdown.  I just made a movie in Omaha.  Made a movie. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I forget what else.  Well, just in the nick of time, because, Dave, we're running out of time.  Oh.  You have to get back to Pete's up the ass guy.  Oh, great.

Oh, that's why you're holding your nose.  I thought it was your new gag.  Oh, no.  Really?  My new fucking radio gag with my friend.  Is this official?  What happened?

[03:10:30]  He said to call you, to call him in his office.  Call him in his office.  And I...  Bravo, Elo.  Do you know what the deal didn't get done today because he had to find you a door?  Very important to keep the talent happy here.  And I wasn't happy when I didn't have a door for my vehicle.  The guy is looking at his watch like he's got somewhere to be aside from here.  Well, where do you have to be?  Where do you got to be?  I got to be at 14th Street.  Why?  What's going on at 14th Street?  I got to go see Tippi.  What's going on there?  Tippi Tom?  Tippi Tom.

[03:11:30]  season and legit.  We give them money.  They can buy whatever the hell they want.  Eric.  And the listeners show up and they're very generous and they buy the homeless people a bunch of  stuff.  You got to run now.  Right?  What we didn't think is we had to...  Then they go back living on the street with brand new shit.  Brand new shit.  And people swipe it.  It's survival of the fittest out there.  Right.  It's like the Serengeti.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you pull up a zebra at the watering hole with a nice jacket on.

Under the subways, yeah.  They go into the subways and stay down there and keep warm.  That's the...  That's the...  See, those...  You know how there's a difference between motherfuckers who use cocaine and motherfuckers who use heroin?  Right, right.  And like, the dudes that use heroin and shit, like the boys that live under the subway, the homeless dudes are like, damn nasty motherfuckers.  That shit's fucked up.  Yeah.  For them, right. 
[03:14:00]  Right.  Even the homeless guys do.  So you don't fuck with them niggas that live under the fucking train.  Do you go on the ground below?  You ever been down there?  Yeah.

How many square footage?  Because I'm looking to buy a car, though.  Yeah, where do you live?  Now, what do you...  You know...  Is there property tax?  It's a secret hideout.  But you really open up one of those manholes and go down below the ground?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's not a manhole.

You don't think he understands sarcasm?  Yeah, motherfucker.  You think he got dug all the way lower...  He's so low, he don't know what the fuck sarcasm is.  That's right. 
[03:15:30]  I don't like that shit either.  Sarcasm.  All right, listen.  Blue, why did you get so pissed off?  Why are you pissed?  And why do you want to leave?  Because you're talking shit.  I wasn't talking shit.  What talking to you?  I wasn't talking dick.  Yeah, see, stop that.  Blue.  This is what...  I wasn't talking dick.  See, this is dumb shit.  Blue, you going to do the homeless shopping spree this year?  I ain't saying he smelled like that.  We're going to send a bunch of you motherfuckers out to the mall, and you guys are going to go shopping? 
[03:16:00]  No.  Huh?  No.  You know what?  What do you want everybody to know?  No, this is our segment.  Don't be offended at this.

We're going to get you some new clothes and shit. 
[03:16:30]  You're one of the stars of the homeless shopping spree.  You've got to understand.  You've got to understand.  It's just the way it is.  I understand it's not a cool thing.  It's not like you could get a shower every day.  You live on the street.  We understand that.  Oh, God.  He's touching things.  It's the way it is, you know?  We understand.  Blue, what do you want?  What do you want?  It's all good, bro.  Listen, we're a national talk show.  What do you want the people of the United States of America to know?  That I'm all right.  You're all right.

[03:18:30]  Here I go, bro.  Yeah, we got a prison story before you leave.  I want a prison story.  I want to hear a work out in the yard and shit, and then someone trying to shank you or some motherfucking  shit like that.  I got shanked, man.  What happened, bro?  I got shanked in the shelter.  You got shanked in the shelter?  Someone stabbed your ass in the shelter, motherfucker.  Who the fuck is that?  See, you stabbed him in the shelter, motherfucker.  Hey, Blue, you ever run into an Arab?  Well, he got his, don't you?  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  You ever run into an Arab Blue and he goes, God damn.  Whoa, hey. 
[03:19:00]  God damn.  Everybody holding their nose.  Let me hold my nose, too.  No, no, no.  You hang out, bro.  You hang out.  Hey, what's going on with sex in prison?  Is that shit going on?  Anybody try to do anything to you in prison?  Anyone, you know, try to, you know, get inside that booty of yours?  You know what?  I really like Blue.  I like Blue.  This motherfucker's got integrity.  He does.  He knows this sarcasm going on, but he can't articulate. 
[03:19:30]  He's like, something is happening.  You know why?  He's like, his attitude.  You know why?  I don't like it.  I'm leaving.  Why are you leaving, Blue?  I don't know, but something happens.  Blue, Blue, where'd it go wrong for you?  How'd you end up on the street?  Were you on the street your whole life?  No, not my whole life.  You have a job and shit, and then what, something happened?  You ever heard of Leona Helmsley?  Leona Helmsley, yeah.  Yeah, I used to work for her.  She's a fucking ugly-ass bitch motherfucker, right?  Yeah.  Leona Helmsley did this shit to you?  And what happened? 
[03:20:00]  She fired your ass, and then you ended up homeless?  Holy shit.  How did you, what, you couldn't get another job?  What happened?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  You got it.  You got it.  Come on.  Release.  It'll make you feel better.  And I'm going deeply.  I used to do guest spots on the radio, and Leona Helmsley didn't like me.  By the way, Patrice.  Oh, you lost your parents, so that fucks you up.  By the way, Patrice.  How old were you?  Oh, man, I got something to say to Patrice.  Okay, go ahead. 
[03:20:30]  Go ahead, what's up, baby?  Go ahead, Opie.  A lot of people are running on the instant feedback.  They're wondering if it's harder for Patrice to plug his nose.  To plug my nose.  That's a racist comment, motherfucker.  Nigga, nigga, fuck you racist huggers.  If you smell this shit, your fingers would grow.  Just because we're using pens, and Patrice has two Lincoln logs up his nose.  Nigga, I got those airplane plugs that expand. 
[03:21:00]  I don't give a fuck what kind of racist shit you huggers say.  This nigga stinks.  Now, I believe in racial harmony, but this motherfucker, the rhythm is off for this nigga shit.  Motherfuckers.  So you fell on some hard times personally, bro.  It was way how healthy, that bitch.  And then you couldn't get a job.  You couldn't concentrate maybe and hold down a job, and you ended up on the street. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  Do you have a plan, a game plan for maybe getting off the street and get back into society?  Oh, that's a good question.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is that why you're checking your watch every so often?  It's like, I got a fucking job interview with some shit.  Nah, nigga, it's a box giveaway downtown.  If I'm missing from around with you dingus holding your nose and making fun of it, he know  he's got to leave.  I got to get some air.  All right, yeah.  I think we all need to get some air.  Nigga, air got to get some you.  I hear you. 
[03:22:00]  You know something?  It's nice to see.  The guy's homeless.  A lot of people like, you know, Tippi Thomas and stuff don't understand what the fuck's  going on half the time.  But the brother here's got some dignity, and he'd like to keep a little of it intact.  Hey, no sarcasm.  I don't like him.  He do.  Yeah.  I hear you.  I hear you.  Blue, we like...  So do I.  Blue, we like our homeless to sing when they come to visit us.  You got a little song you could do for us?  What kind of show?  I don't know.  You do a little rap?  Whatever you got in here.  Why don't you sing us one of those? 
[03:22:30]  What do you got?  I ain't got none.  Nah, huh?  I ain't got none.  Who plays the flute?  Grey Wolf.  Who's the guy?  Grey Wolf.  Grey Wolf came in here and did a great song, man.  Oh, my God.  You want to hear Grey Wolf's?  Grey Wolf.  Do you know Grey Wolf?  Oh, that hack?  Hack.  This song should be on radio.  You know Grey Wolf?  Grey Wolf.  That hack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Listen to this song.  Listen to this song.  It's really quick.  It's like 50 seconds.  This is what Grey Wolf did when he came in here.  Let's give a listen.  Let's see how this comes out.  All right?  Tippi Thomas.  All right.  Here we go.  I got a good break.  This is a story about a man. 
[03:23:00]  And he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice was rowdy.  You could hear it all through his train signal.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Sippy Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  All right, yo.  All right, yo.  All right, yo.  It's late that night. 
[03:23:30]  And I have nowhere to go.  My money's gone and off to all my friends.  And the cop says to me, hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, and you don't have an angel.  Let me show you.  And he says, let's get out of here. 
[03:24:00]  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have homes.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  What do you think? 
[03:24:30]  That song should be on the radio.  Dude, I'm almost crying.  Ain't that some good shit?  Fuck Letter Cohen, man.  That was the best song I ever had.  Isn't that amazing?  And we all said the same thing.  That is one of the best songs ever.  Oh, my God.  And that motherfucker just came in here and riffed it.  Yeah, we get one more verse. 
[03:25:00]  I'm telling you, we can make that rock on the radio.  I know.  Now you've got to help the motherfucker.  Fuck the nose shit.  Can you niggas help fucking...  What's his name?  Gray Wolf.  Are you fucking joking me?  How good is that?  Isn't that great?  That almost made me cry.  Fuck Blue.  Blue.  Blue coming in with this hacky smell shit.  And Gray Wolf is doing...  I almost cried.  Off the top of his head.  Yeah.  That shit is genius.  Isn't that amazing?  And the sound of his voice, the pain in there and shit. 
[03:25:30]  Pain is something new here.  Pain.  You don't need Leonard Cohen.  Did you need Leonard Cohen?  That was the most emotional...  My brother was...  You can't fake that shit.  Shelter me from the pouring rain.  Are you joking?  Exactly.  And then the cop said to me, I'm not even going to fuck with homeless people no more.  Right?  I can't even make fun of this motherfucking noise.  Why'd you play Gray Wolf now?  Now you fucked it up.  Now I don't even smell them no more.  Now.  Now.  The Gray Wolf singing.  Yeah. 
[03:26:00]  The smell go away from my nose.  It's like...  His voice cracked.  From the...  Oh, really?  I don't smell them no more.  Steve from Jersey.  Opie, this song should be on the radio.  And XM is what exactly?  I'm talking about regular rotation.  Should have regular rotation.  Make it a thing.  Dude, man.  Is that...  That...  I'm not bullshitting.  That's...  That's emotional, man.  Yeah.  Drew Boogie threw that to music.  Drew Boogie threw that to music.  He just came in with a guitar.  And Drew put the music really behind it to really make it...  We just need one more verse and I'm telling you... 
[03:26:30]  We need another verse, Adam.  But we're afraid...  That song could go.  We're afraid he's going to screw it up like when they told Ralph Cramden to act.  Rachel.  You've come...  That won't be all natural.  You have to keep that.  That's my sister's name.  Ralph Cramden's what?  You don't...  Oh, Rachel?  You don't like the name Rachel.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Rachel's your sister's name?  Dude, man.  I won't say that name.  All right, listen.  We want to do one more thing before we get out of here.  So, Blue, are you going to do the homeless shopping spree with us this year?  Yeah, I will.  We'll hook you up.  You want to sing a little song?  I think he sings. 
[03:27:00]  Do you sing?  Yeah, he does.  He don't want to follow me.  No, he does.  He just...  How do you follow?  He's the opening act of Grey Wool.  What do you got?  What do you got, Blue?  Give us a little something-something.  We'd love it again.  Something-something.  Yeah, let's go.  See, I got to feel it.  I got to feel it.  All right, feel it, bro.  Yeah.  Feel it.  Come on.  Who do you like?  Come on.  Feel something.  What do you listen to?  Come on.  I ain't listening to nothing.  I'm listening to young people.  What do you listen to through those headphones you got around your neck?  Yeah.  What are you listening to on your...  You got an iPod?  1982 Walkman. 
[03:27:30]  No, it's a CD.  CD?  CD, sorry.  Yeah, Opie.  Opie.  I know what a dumb name is.  I hope he's going to get his ass handed to him.  Fucking homeless guy laughing at my name.  He's got a...  What are you feeling there, Blue?  What are you feeling?  I'm feeling...  Come on.  ...to be nice with y'all.  All right, yeah.  Give us a little song.  It'll bring us all back together.  What?  I'm trying to think.  All right.  Patrice is just asking about...  Yeah, I'm just asking him.  Where's this Grey Wool?  Where is it?  You seen him?  I'm fucking way back.  I haven't seen him in a while.  Way back.  Oh, my God. 
[03:28:00]  All right, yeah.  Give us a Way Back song.  Let's go.  Okay.  Yeah, he's got some.  Here we go.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,  Have you seen her?  Tell me, have you seen her?  Why, oh, why did you have to leave me?  Go away, oh, yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, have someone to lean on, a baby of loss.  Okay.  That was the song there.  Drew Boogie will get a whole of that and make it another hit.  That was the B-side.  That was the song I was playing when Leona said, um, Blue, can you sit in my office for a minute?  Hold on, let me turn it down.  What?  Get out and take that stupid fucking song with you.  Drew Boogie is to Phil Spector of the homeless.  So make something out of that.  Yeah.  All right, Blue, thank you.  We'll see you at the homeless shopping spree this year.  Homeless shopping spree. 
[03:29:00]  All right.  Anything to plug?  Except our noses?  Nothing.  Nothing.  All right.  I didn't get paid, okay?  Yeah.  Oh, we're paying him today?  Yeah, we'll get him a couple bucks.  Yeah, give him some.  All right, we'll give him a few bucks.  A couple dollars for Gray Wolf on me.  All right.  50 bucks.  All right, Blue, you rock.  He's a survivor.  Two out of the ten that we brought to the last homeless shopping spree are no longer with us.  Who's the other guy that died?  Ziggy died.  We know Ziggy died.  Damn.  Ziggy was great.  Yeah, I got some singles for the gentleman.  There we go.  Patrice, toss him down.  There you go. 
[03:29:30]  And the other guy, Sperm.  Sperm, yeah.  Oh, Sperm was crazy.  Sperm was crazy.  Yeah, he died too.  Sperm died?  We had Ziggy come in here and sing Silent Night.  It brought tears to everybody.  Silent Night.  Holy Night.  Did anybody almost cry when I heard the Gray Wolf?  I almost was in tears.  Yeah.  That was amazing, dude.  Wasn't it amazing?  Dude, people email all the time about that song.  They want it longer.  They want more of it.  They want a copy of it. 
[03:30:00]  But that was Nick right there.  Yeah, that's all he did.  That's all we got.  That's all he did.  That's all he did.  That's all me, baby.  Yeah.  Makes an impact.  That was done off the cuff, man.  Off the freaking cuff.  Mother of Jesus, that was amazing.  So, all right.  Whoa.  There are musicians that like to try to put emotion in their voice and go, yeah, I was feeling  this day.  But when you listen to that, that is every bit of emotion that guy had poured out into the shelter.  The cop telling him the fucking mistakes.  I'll say it again.  For the third time, it has that Leonard Cohen thing going on there.  It thing's great.  Shelter me from the pouring. 
[03:30:30]  You have any Howlin' Wolf?  It's a good one.  Howlin' Wolf, sure.  It was like, it was Jesus.  All right, listen.  Good shit.  All right.  All right.  We got some view on it.  Jesus.  How do we go with that?  Since we can't smell, we'll go to the view.  We got the view.  The view.  We got Star Jones talking about her sorority life, Anthony, on the view.  Sorority life?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Who knew that Star Jones was in a sorority?  But she talked about that, I think, yesterday.  What was it?  The Moos, they call them back then. 
[03:31:00]  The Omega Moos.  Omega Moos.  Omega Moos.  Omega Moos.  You're just a wannabe.  Wannabe better than me.  The Star's all, well, not skinny, but she slimmed down a bit.  But her head is still, like, giant.  Giant.  It's creepy.  She's starting to look like an alien.  It really is.  She's starting to look like an alien.  Same thing with Al Roker.  Al Roker lost a bunch of weight, but his head, the head remains the same. 
[03:31:30]  It's that unnatural weight loss, man.  Yeah.  Right, right.  That stomach staple shit.  Yeah, you're not going to do that, right, Patrice?  Some people have to just stay what weight they are.  Either I'm going to lose it or I'm not going to lose it, but I'm not going to carve my stomach.  Because you're still the same fat motherfucker.  You just got a quarter of your stomach left.  Your body ain't right.  It ain't right.  You got to cut part of your stomach out.  All right, well, why don't we do this and listen to the audio?  She talks about the special greeting that her sorority house had. 
[03:32:00]  Was it eating a cake?  If you were part of the sorority, if you saw another sister, you had a special greeting, right?  All right.  I'm just like a proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated.  And Brandi Smith's a member of my sorority.  She's here with a whole group of members of sorority.  Different sororities.  Yes, sororities who are there at AU.  Hey, Brandi, how you doing, Sara?  Hi, Star, how are you?  What's it called? 
[03:32:30]  Sara, as in sorority sister.  Do that sound you make whenever you're...  Skeely!  What?  Skeely!  Oh, boy.  Okay.  That's a pig noise.  Wow.  That's a pig noise.  Wow.  That's how they greet each other.  Wee!  Wee!  She was part of the ugly sorority.  Yep.  Every college has it.  You have the hot chicks during the one sorority.  The Alphas are so hot.  That's my sorority.  The Alphas...  No, it depends what college you're at.  No, the Alphas...  Really?  Yeah, the ones... 
[03:33:00]  Because they always go with the Qs, I think.  Or the AKAs and Alphas.  The AKAs or whatever.  Alpha, Alpha, Alpha, Alpha, Alpha, or whatever.  They're the sexy ones, supposedly.  Yeah?  Yeah.  No way.  Yes.  The Sigmas were the moves at my college.  The Sigmas were all the smart, ugly bitches.  All right, here we go.  Fake one of your...  Skeely!  What?  Skeely!  Can you skeely me, Brandi?  There you go.  See, explain this to me.  Well, that was just the way we would greet you.  How do you even come up with that? 
[03:33:30]  Sweetheart, this is the eldest, traditionally black woman sorority in the nation.  Can I grow up going in?  1908.  Yes, if you can come in.  You certainly can.  Are you going to rush?  We have a variety of African Americans, white, Latino, Asians.  However, it is the oldest black woman sorority.  And in 1908, there weren't a lot of white sororities inviting us, okay?  A black sorority back in 1908?  In 1908.  That must have been something.  Can you imagine the hazing they got away with back then?  Wow. 
[03:34:00]  All right, baby.  All right, baby.  Here's what I want you to do.  I want you to go up to that white man's house and take some of your black pubic hair and put it in his rice.  Oh, shit.  And then hum a song.  And sing.  And I want you to sing the theme to Give Me a Break.  Oh, baby doll, this is great.  1908.  We got our own sorority.  Let's go back to the sorority. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, it's on fire again.  Oh, sorority house is burning again.  It's on fire again.  Halfway built.  They're building the back of it back up and the front's on fire again.  How did that stay up?  Where was this place?  1908.  Black sorority.  I'm telling you, but big, fat, sassy bitches was even in then.  Back then?  Don't you burn down my motherfucking sorority house, my man.  Let me tell you something.  No, man. 
[03:35:00]  It wasn't like, what's her name?  Who was that singer in the days of the flapper and she was kind of hot?  What's her name?  Oh, um.  I can't remember her name.  Baker?  The chick.  Josephine Baker.  Josephine Baker.  She was gorgeous.  Yeah.  I was thinking about the U2 song.  JFK.  No.  Josephine Baker.  Yeah, she was hot for like the back then times. 
[03:35:30]  Lena Horne.  Lena Horne.  Well, we got more audio.  Start.  Lena Horne.  She's talking about her hazing experience when she went to college.  Mm-hmm.  Star Jones.  When you were in the sorority show, was there hazing back then?  And I wonder with Brandi if it's changed.  Interestingly enough, we did have all across the country, a lot of the fraternity and sororities  did have hazing issues.  And I mean, I still hear about it now.  But I was chapter president, and then I became second national vice president of Alpha, very  much involved, and helped to write the anti-hazing policy that's still part of one of the policies 
[03:36:00]  there now.  Oh, shut up.  She was the buzzkill?  She likes to think she was.  She was the buzzkill?  Anti-hazing, because, you know, take any of the fun out of it.  Boy, that must have been some sorority.  What the fuck?  Big fat Star Jones.  The WKO is always bad bitches, man.  They always, don't call the sorority or fraternity if you can't haze the members that are coming  in.  Alumni include Lena Horne, Lola Falana, this Cicely Tyson. 
[03:36:30]  And helped to write the anti-hazing policy that's still part of one of the policies there  now.  Did you get haze, though?  Are you allowed to talk about that?  Well, see, you know, for me, I didn't consider a lot of it haze.  It was silly stuff, like putting spaghetti on your face and telling you it was a worm.  But, you know, that kind of stuff.  Yeah, really.  That's pretty heavy stuff.  I know.  But none of this jumping off buildings and eating bad things.  Nothing that would ever get me in any trouble.  That's not true, man.  She didn't join a sorority, man. 
[03:37:00]  She's a lion sack of shit.  She's not allowed to say that shit, man.  Right.  She can't come off like she's endorsing.  It's all secretive and shit.  Yeah.  Black sorority in 1908, I think it was called a kitchen.  That's Mr. Bildo from Detroit.  Oh, that's awful.  God damn it.  Steven from Dallas.  Oh, lordy, lordy.  Someone could be burning across in the front yard again.  Can't you guys, can't you goddamn racist respect black history for once instead of February?  Nothing.  No.  Lordy, lordy.  And then he's so racist. 
[03:37:30]  Lordy, lordy.  He knows how to spell lordy, lordy.  I bet he spelled it L-A-U-D-E-Y.  You sons of bitches.  You know damn well, everybody walked past that sorority house and was like, just smelled  like pancakes all the time coming out of there.  Pancakes and syrup.  Wait a minute.  Are you trying to say Aunt Jemima was an A-K-A?  Aunt Jemima was an A-K-A.  And Uncle Ben.  Uncle Ben was in the fraternity.  Talking about hazing, right?  Doug from Arizona, from whitebag.com.  Did they have to drop cotton out of their asses on the other sorority's house? 
[03:38:00]  Like, oh, we had to drop marshmallows.  Yes, indeed.  That's a rumor, obviously, yes.  Okay.  Someone's suggesting that Star Jones actually had to carry the houses in her ass and drop  them on marshmallows.  You was in a fraternity?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of them drinking white boy ones?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Total just.  Oh, God.  White people just in there drinking.  Woo!  Was you a woo, white boy?  Woo!  No, we were...  Who isn't at that age in a fraternity? 
[03:38:30]  Of course they are.  Woo!  Oh, dude, let me tell...  Dude.  Down at the fucking...  Let's go down to the rat.  Get some beers, man.  To the rat.  They're fucking going to the rat skeller on campus.  Oh, college people, I fucking hated them.  I never liked sorority's attorneys, man.  I just...  I didn't like that...  That divisive horse shot, I hated it.  Me and my friends used to try to destroy it anytime they come through, marching through  the...  With the stepping and the...  Get the fuck out of here. 
[03:39:00]  I was seeing a girl that went up to...  She went to Quinnipiac College up in Connecticut, so I drive up there to see her, and just the  guys and girls that were at this fucking school, the flyers and posters they'd hang...  You going to the mixer this weekend?  It's like a mixer.  What the fuck?  And it was just awful parties at the rat skeller, go down there, and just these geeks and dorks  hanging out, and the fraternities and stuff.  Wanted no part of it ever. 
[03:39:30]  Thank God I fucked up my schooling so bad, there was no chance I would ever end up in college.  Anthony, the listeners are on fire.  Yeah.  Matt from Cleveland, Ohio.  Of course she wrote the anti-hazing policy.  This fat bitch probably got hay so much, he had to help write the policy.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  No, that's a good-ass point, because she was so fat.  Stop fucking with me.  Yeah, she's like...  Billie Holiday, you know...  Billie Holiday, it's another one, I think.  Sorry, go ahead.  That's all right, she was so fat, it's like, that is the pretty sorority.  Yeah.  So you know she had trouble, you know what I mean?  She fought her ass off to make it through and then make a change. 
[03:40:00]  She was the ugly one.  All right, we got another clip here.  You know, time was a big deal when I was in college, and the sorority sisters, we had  to say this little chant.  Girls, I wonder if you remember this.  Whenever somebody asked you what time it was, we would say, according to my chronometer, which  is in direct accord with the great sigil movement, by which all time is commonly recorded.  I cannot say for certain what the exact time is.  However, without too great a fear being grossly incorrect, I estimate the time to be...  Beep!  We'll be right back with Neil Diamond. 
[03:40:30]  Dorothy Danridge.  She don't look that bad either.  Dorothy Danridge, yeah.  There's a picture of her.  Diane Carroll, Dorothy Danridge, Lola Colonna.  She looks like Janet Jackson there a little bit.  She's gorgeous, man.  Dorothy Danridge was beautiful.  All right, well, and don't forget Pam Greer.  Pam Greer in her day, huh?  Don't you ever forget Pam Greer, baby.  Don't ever.  Lola Colonna was like, back when Bob Hope was doing his shtick, she was like the high  one, hey, how about that Lola Colonna?  And the girl that played Kizzy in Roots. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  Cicely Tyson?  No, no, no.  Is that her?  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  We got one minute left in the program.  We'll play Kizzy.  Kizzy.  Ah, shit.  Hey, here's the deal.  We didn't get to half the shit we wanted to today.  Half?  Leslie Uggams.  Leslie Uggams.  Very good.  I am going to tease for tomorrow's show.  We got the Tyra Banks stuttering special.  We got to get to that.  Can't get enough of Tyra Banks.  Tyra Banks.  Tyra Banks.  She's more white than black, though.  Oh, yeah.  She looks good.  New news teases.  One of our favorite bits we do on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:41:30]  Also, we got to talk about this black dude that wants to get rid of the white race.  Also, we have Regis singing Christmas songs.  Yeah, that stuff.  Regis singing Christmas songs?  Yeah.  And don't forget to vote for the best of the ONA show since coming to XM.
