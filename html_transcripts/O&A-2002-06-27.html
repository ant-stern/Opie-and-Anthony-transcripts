<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy segment dedicated to their "WOW" contest, a listener-submitted photo contest showcasing women.  The hosts, along with caller Tom, provided graphic descriptions of the contestants, heavily criticizing the New York entries while praising those from Dallas.  Specific physical attributes were discussed in detail, often using crude language.  The hosts also referenced photos on their unofficial website, foundrymusic.com, and the challenges of adhering to corporate content rules.  This transitioned into a discussion of Rich Voss's golf game at Bethpage State Park, with Voss calling in to recount humorous anecdotes from his round.  Paul Mercurio also joined the conversation.  The show then shifted to a discussion about WNEW morning show host Scott Farrell, who was reportedly facing arrest for failing to return a car.  The hosts speculated on Farrell's lifestyle and past behavior, recounting various anecdotes.  Further calls regarding the "WOW" contest followed, including a discussion about a contestant's gender. This led to personal anecdotes from Opie and Anthony about abandoning cars and dealing with repo men.  The segment concluded with a caller seeking advice on passing a drug test, prompting suggestions from the hosts and other callers.

The next segment began with a continuation of the drug test advice, with listeners offering various strategies and products.  A caller, John, shared news of a Supreme Court ruling on random drug testing in high schools.  This segued into a highly critical and offensive discussion about a Muslim woman suing Florida for suspending her license after refusing to remove her veil for her driver's license photo, with the hosts and callers expressing derogatory opinions about the woman, her husband, and the ACLU.  The conversation devolved into offensive commentary on Islam and Muslims.  Numerous listener calls followed, some relating to the previous topics and others offering unrelated commentary, including a discussion about a Catholic school teacher's unusual sex advice.  The segment featured the "F.U. Line," followed by a discussion of movies, specifically Anthony's negative experiences with "Wind Talkers" and "Angel Eyes," which included offensive stereotypes and jokes.

The show continued with a critique of Nicolas Cage's acting, comparing his roles in various films, including *Con Air*, *Face Off*, *Raising Arizona*, and *Valley Girl*. This transitioned into a broader discussion of Hollywood clich√©s, using *Windtalkers* as an example.  A prank call claiming to be Nicolas Cage followed.  Further movie recommendations and discussions ensued, leading back to the "WOW" contest.  Caller Stashi voiced concern about the show's commentary on the contestants' appearances, prompting a discussion about body image and photo angles.  The hosts continued to discuss contestants using vulgar language.  The conversation touched on the death penalty and a correction officer criticized the show's interaction with a website for prisoners seeking pen pals. The hosts then discussed the website's personal ads with crude jokes. A news story about hormones in semen sparked a discussion filled with sexual innuendo.  The death of John Entwistle of The Who prompted a debate comparing Black Sabbath and The Who, with the hosts using offensive language.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the "WOW" contest and more contestant photos.  Little Jimmy Norton and Big Kevin were mentioned as being in studio.

A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to a heated debate about the greatest rock bands since 1970.  The hosts and callers engaged in a profanity-laced argument about Black Sabbath versus bands like Led Zeppelin, The Who, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and U2, frequently referencing Ozzy Osbourne. Homophobic slurs and other offensive language were used repeatedly.  The comparison of U2's "Sunday Bloody Sunday" to Black Sabbath's "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath" sparked a lengthy argument about plagiarism.  Jim Norton was present in the studio and participated in the debate.  The segment ended with continued disagreement and inflammatory comments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  You are very ignorant.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show for today.  Oi!  I'm telling me to shut up because you said ho!  Alright, relax guys.  Couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, including...  Huh?  Columbus.  Ah yes, Columbus.  We've got a little ratings thing in Columbus.  Little thing.  Looks like we're doing okay on the big wazoo.  Looks that way.  Doing alright. 
[00:00:30]  It was very nice to see.  Went up a little bit.  A little bit.  Thank you, Columbus.  Still got a ways to go, but we're heading in the right direction in Columbus as well, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  So thank you, Columbus.  If you're in Columbus or anywhere else outside of New York City, 866-2774-WOW.  866-2774-WOW.  All right.  You know, guys, we don't want to spend a lot of time on the WOW Contest.  Right.  It's more of an off-air thing so you guys can have some fun with. 
[00:01:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Kind of an underlying theme.  And eventually, the listeners will decide who has the best WOW, and that lovely lady's  going to get $5,000 courtesy of risquevideo.com.  Yeah.  I guess it's kind of fun to go to opiananthony.com every day to see the new ladies, right?  Sure is, Hope.  And sometimes, during the show, some new ladies pop up, even.  You never know when the new ladies are going to pop up on opiananthony.com, right?  God, you never know. 
[00:01:30]  Well, I guess some of our listeners are discovering the new ladies up on opiananthony.com.  Uh-huh.  So let's go to Tom really fast here.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Two things.  Yes.  First, a chick, Lisa, in Dallas is hot.  Is she one of the new?  Yeah.  Dallas is running away with the contest.  Yeah, but now you've got issues about that chick in New York.  Hold on.  When we get down to ten finalists, they could all be from Dallas at this point.  Could be.  That's the way it's looking.  Dallas, hot chicks.  They just gave us three more, maybe four more hot girls, Dallas. 
[00:02:00]  One girl looks like Kate Hudson with boobs.  Right.  An older Kate Hudson with boobs.  You've got to check it out for yourself.  I think that's Stacy, contestant 43.  She's beautiful.  But, guys, New York is failing us, man.  The chick, number 45, looks like she's got a piece of an umbilical cord sticking out of her gut.  I don't believe that's belly piercing with little beads coming out of it.  It's rank, and she's got more chins than a Chinese phone book, dude.  She's harsh.  She's like 90 or something.  At this point, we're embarrassing ourselves all over the country. 
[00:02:30]  The New York contestants.  What, are we punishing our listeners for not bringing us the hot chicks in New York?  Hey, that girl was lovely, and then Jim got numbers.  And exchanged all sorts of information.  But besides that...  Bodily fluids.  You know, she's beastly.  The belly button piercing is the thing the guy went for?  How about the underarm hair?  Look at this picture.  How about the nip that he can put your coat on?  Look at the underarm.  Ugh.  You know what, dude?  You know what's bad about that? 
[00:03:00]  It's underarm hair.  Yeah.  You're a fan of that?  No, I don't have any opinion on that.  I'm not a fan of that.  No.  Unless it's on a girl who's like 19 and she's trying to do the hippie thing, then you can kind of overlook it.  But this lady's, what, 45?  I don't know.  And besides having underarm hair, it's sweaty underarm hair.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's all hot.  It's sweaty and matted to her skin.  Matted down a bit.  There you go, New York.  That's what we got representing us.  There's New York representing.  Thank you, New York, for helping us out. 
[00:03:30]  And if you go to foundrymusic.com, you can see the picture that Steve put next to her.  If you've seen the movie Total Recall, you'll see Arnold dressed up in the airport in that disguise.  How long do you plan on being on Mars?  Two weeks.  And then he lifts a big head, this big robotic head.  She kind of looks like that woman.  Very similar.  Yeah.  Very similar.  You know, every day people email us and say, this website, how do you get there? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  I think listeners are sick of us saying foundrymusic.com at this point.  Yeah.  Very easy.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  It's the unofficial O.P. Anthony website because we get a little crazy over there.  So unofficial that the name has nothing to do with this show.  That's right.  You know, because unfortunately we're trying to get along in a corporate world here.  Yeah.  But, you know, the corporation has all these silly, silly rules.  Rules that they put on websites.  Rules.  So we decide to just not be a part of it. 
[00:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  Unofficially.  Right.  And there is a link.  Unofficially.  And there is a link to foundrymusic.com off O.P. and Anthony.com.  Right.  Okay.  Easy to get to.  Now, are we going to spend the first half hour talking about the contestants again?  No.  Here it is.  Dallas just gave us three or four new hot chicks.  Unbelievably hot chicks.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  They are the Sacramento of this contest.  Sacramento at this point letting us down big time.  Boston gave us a new girl.  One of the girls that was in the 55-gallon drum challenge, by the way. 
[00:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  And Becky, right?  Becky looks fine.  She's representing Boston nicely.  And we got the beast from New York.  She's a beast.  The beast from the east.  You know, I felt, I kind of felt bad taking shots at her because we did talk to her.  Yeah.  And she was really nice.  I didn't talk to her all that much.  She's really nice.  She's nice enough.  She likes going out in the woods and getting naked and taking pictures and...  Oh, there's pictures of her filthy in a big tree stump. 
[00:05:30]  She showed us...  Are we allowed to put those pictures up on Foundry?  I don't see why not.  Give them the Steves.  We have them.  Scan them in.  That's her thing, man.  She goes out in the woods with her friends and they get all naked and take pictures and  then they...  I don't know what they do with the pictures.  I don't know.  There's probably some big wooded orgy going on.  She doesn't shave anything, as a matter of fact.  Hey, look at that.  Girl representing Las Vegas just popped up on OpieandAnthony.com.  Stop.  Let me say, hey, what do you mean by that? 
[00:06:00]  Where is that?  All right.  All right.  Let me take a...  Hey, hi.  Look at that.  Hey there.  Hello there.  All right, man.  Our listeners are coming down hard on us now.  Tony.  You.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Am I on the air?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right.  I'm sorry.  The contest this time, the girls are gruesome.  They're killing me.  You know, if it wasn't for Dallas, we'd be in a world of hurt right now. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, you ain't kidding.  There was a girl from New York, though, the blonde.  I forgot what number she was.  She was beautiful.  I forgot her name already.  Yeah, so did I.  Corinne or something like that, right?  Yeah, that's the one.  Typical, typical guy.  I forgot the name already.  No, she's beautiful.  Yeah.  We're proud that she's representing New York.  I think, uh, officially that's the only one we're proud of.  Yeah, okay.  Because, uh, there's a few other girls representing New York on a, they're kind of from D.C., but  they came up.  Yeah, they came up.  They had their pictures taken here, but they're not from New York.  No. 
[00:07:00]  No.  Well, actually, the big black chick was good, though.  The fat one.  Norton likes her, right?  What?  Not bad.  Candy's not fat, man.  Not Candy.  The other black girl.  Yeah.  The one that was on Real World London, right?  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  The one that Earl really had a problem with his head being on her body.  Yeah, that's the one.  Yeah.  All right, I gotta run.  I'm gonna go listen to myself.  All right, by the way, the Earl watch continues.  He's still not talking to anyone around here.  Yeah, nothing.  Wow.  Ooh, wow, Earl.  I don't know what to do with my day.  I don't know what to do. 
[00:07:30]  I'm really making a statement by ignoring all of us in the hallways.  God, I'm all broken up.  Did you see, uh, David on line eight?  Have you pulled that picture up yet?  No.  You got it?  David.  David.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up, man?  Yeah, I can't believe how horrible these girls look.  You guys always ragging on Gemini, but contestant number 39 looks like Leonardo DiCaprio.  All right, hold on, dude.  Let's back up first of all.  Gemini has to be a guy at this point. 
[00:08:00]  Has to be.  I don't know when Philly's gonna confess that Gemini is a guy.  A man.  There's a shot from behind, and look, it's a, uh, it's a yam bag.  It's a yam bag.  Yeah, there's no, uh, puffiness of, uh, female anatomy like that.  This is just a guy's sack.  Look, it looks like a plum.  Look at this.  Dude, what's that?  Okay?  And the one is hanging lower than the other.  It's either a guy or a woman that I want to marry. 
[00:08:30]  Oh.  And you have a problem with contestant number 39?  Doesn't she look like Leonardo DiCaprio?  Leonardo DiCaprio?  I was just looking at the picture and laughing, man.  You hit that one on the head.  It looks like Leonardo DiCaprio with boobs, man.  That's Leo in Gilbert Grape.  All right, dude, I gotta go, all right?  All right, stop.  How funny is that?  You know what?  We're doing it again.  Yeah, I know.  You're not supposed to be making fun of the ladies.  It makes it harder for them to come down here. 
[00:09:00]  I guess if you're a chick that's gotta look like a guy, at least look like a fresh-faced  young boy.  Look at that.  That's classic.  Someone has to do the split screen on her.  Split screen.  You'll find a Leo picture that looks just like her.  Do the split screen.  We're never gonna get any girls for this.  In New York.  I know.  Mark, what's up?  Guys, I mean, Obi, that's so nasty, bro.  How can you overlook a girl with hair on her arms?  That's so disgusting.  I'm saying if you're at one of these all-day concerts, she's 19, she's digging the music, 
[00:09:30]  she's hot besides that, you can overlook that, sure.  Nah.  Bro, are you high?  I mean, come on, dude.  No.  I'm going home with you guys.  I mean, I don't know, man.  I love you guys' show, but, Obi, that's disgusting, dude.  Any girl, I don't care how loud she is.  She has hair on their arms.  She's done, bro.  It doesn't make me happy, but, you know, I've seen worse things on women.  No, it's too manly.  It's like a man.  Really?  Hairy legs I find awful.  Yeah, oh, without a doubt.  Hairy arms, again, you don't have to really look. 
[00:10:00]  I'm not a fan of them, but if they're there, they're there.  Yeah, you're not sitting there going, wow, what a turn on.  It's like, eh, all right, well.  Because the armpits you don't deal with on a sexual level most times.  No, but you know something?  You're looking at them.  Yeah.  You're looking at it.  You see these tufts of hair under there.  You get a little tussle and keep going.  A little underarm tussle.  Every once in a while, a little bit pops out, but in general, she's not walking around with  her arms up in the air, you know?  Ugh.  I don't know.  I ain't buying it. 
[00:10:30]  She has three boxes.  That's going to be turned around on me, but it's like, ugh, it's, you know, it's a,  whatever.  I don't know.  That's something that's a real turn off.  If she's really hot and she has that, then I can, you know, you overlook that.  That's all I'm saying.  Okay.  Rich Voss is on the phone, Anthony.  He has just completed.  Oh.  The black horse at Bethpage State Park.  Remember yesterday on the show?  Hey, what's happening?  Hold on.  He swore that he would break 100 on the black horse.  He was like, I'll break 100. 
[00:11:00]  Black horse was the one that they just had the tournament on.  The U.S. Open.  The U.S. Open.  It's not a golf course.  It's a torture chamber.  I told you.  First of all, that court, it's brutal.  I'll tell you, I shot 104.  Okay.  Not bad, though.  No, listen to me.  I had four sevens, four triples, and an eight.  I was going in pretty good.  But this court, they kept it like they had the tournament going there. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  You could not hit the ball out of the rough.  I'm telling you, you couldn't hit the ball.  Yeah.  The rough is brutal at that course.  And if you're a midget like Voss, I can't even imagine you walking through it.  I sunk in at the sand.  I swear to God, there was one sand trap where I saw Israelis and Palestinians fighting in it.  It was so big.  Yeah.  The sand traps are ridiculously large.  Hey, is it true that someone saw you in one of the sand traps and said, oh, my God, save that man.  He's in quicksand.  And then the other guy said, oh, no, it's just Rich Voss. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  That's what happened.  But you know what?  Rich Voss.  He's already halfway in.  Right.  Oh, no.  It's just the midget Voss.  Okay.  With his long torso.  I had to swaddle my words.  I didn't break.  I shot 104.  Right.  The next time, I'll break it.  I never played the course.  Now I know the course.  It was classic.  We were in our back office, you know, getting ready for the show.  The phone rings.  It's Voss.  He goes, if I par 17 and 18, I will break 100.  Yeah.  I'll get a 99. 
[00:12:30]  I go, Voss, why don't you explain the par 3 you're looking at right now?  And he goes, oh, it's 200.  How many yards is it?  It's like 200 over uphill, over so much sand.  It's ridiculous.  You know what?  You've got to take your hats off to these pros because it's like...  I'm screwing.  I'm making enough.  I know.  I looked at that hole and I go, there's no way I'm getting a par here.  I got on 15.  I flubbed it into weeds that were higher than me. 
[00:13:00]  And I had it again.  It's just...  Vandalized.  You know what?  It's a beautiful place.  It really is.  I stink.  You play that course just so you can tell people you did it.  I hate that course.  Always have.  I think a 104 is good considering how tough everybody said it was.  Well, you know what?  But, you know, for the first time playing there, it's good, too.  All right.  Hey, Paul Mercurio wants in on this.  Paulie.  Hey.  What's up?  How you doing, man?  All right.  Is Voss on?  Yes.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Voss, 104.  It must have been like a Guido Dorf on golf out there. 
[00:13:30]  You know what?  Every time I looked at the hall, I thought of your lips.  I thought I said, I'm going to get...  I know I can get my ball in his lips.  Can I get it into this cup?  People asking you if you were Tim Conway?  Didn't you take...  Did you put cigarettes out on the green?  Did I put cigarettes out on the green?  What are you doing?  I'm trying to think about these, Paul.  Why don't you hang up and call back, talk to French and see if both of you can come up  with something.  What was that? 
[00:14:00]  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  That was like an essay contest you just said.  I know.  That was pretty good.  Hold on.  As the ref, I've got to give Paul one there, man.  What?  Putting out the cigarettes on the green.  Yeah, I did put a couple out, but I figured...  I did.  You didn't have to bend down to do it.  Huh?  Did you have to check your jewelry at the first tee?  Yeah, and the guys I played with, well, the other guy was okay.  Our caddy, this kid knew nothing, but he was a nice high school kid, you know. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  I gave him a nice tip.  He gave him three bucks.  All right.  Three bucks.  Three bucks.  Rolls of pennies.  All right, guys, are you yelling at us?  Hey, listen.  We're doing golf talk again.  I had nothing.  I just wanted to call in and say, hey, it didn't happen, but next time maybe it will.  So, you know, we'll get...  You're fessing to 104?  Yeah.  That's a...  You know what?  You can...  There was a shot.  That means you shot 122.  No.  No, listen to me, stupid.  Okay?  There was one shot.  I had a ball on the tree.  I turned around and I used my putter and I hit it between my legs out of there. 
[00:15:00]  If you had any cojones, you would have cut the tree down.  What a guy.  Is Paul still on?  Did you have to caddy for anybody to get into that thing or what?  I swear, you just went from a middle to an open mic or pole.  You are really...  You are decreasing.  Really, I'm telling you...  I'm decreasing?  It's like talking to Georgie Jessen whenever I talk to you.  I feel...  I'm in the 20s.  I feel like I should be begging for bread. 
[00:15:30]  You know what?  I can shut up, but people still are going to stare at your lips, okay?  You have to put a pad over your head to hide your...  I'm talking to a radio station in the...  It's not tuned in.  Listen, congratulations on the 104.  I'll leave you alone now.  All right.  It was good talking to everybody.  Opie, we're going to play this course in Jersey.  New Jersey National, you and I, all right?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hey, Norton.  I can't do it.  Stop, little fella.  All right.  Get out of here.  They're gone.  Lost shot 104.  I think that's good. 
[00:16:00]  I just don't like the way he said he takes his hat off to the pros.  Like we were somehow looking at him in Tiger.  He's going, well, you know what?  The better man won.  He's one of the best golfers that ever lived, and you're a 3'4 sex addict.  I'll take my hat off to him.  Yeah.  Like, you know, two great competitors met, and one was bested.  Well, I take my hat off to him.  I got him.  Horse's ass.  He was the better man.  Take your hat off when you're bobbing in some fella's lap.  That's when you should take your hat off, so the brim doesn't bother his belly.  Tim is suggesting that Voss in the Sand Trap must have looked like the Jawas stealing 
[00:16:30]  the droids on Alderaan.  Very good.  That's great.  Lil Voss in the Sand Trap.  Taking his hat off to people all over town.  You know, I got to take my hat off.  Yeah, you're wearing a hat.  Why don't you take it off?  Show a little respect.  Complete jackass.  Because until I play it, I really can't judge how well the pros are doing.  Yeah, I know Tiger had a couple good games, but...  All right. 
[00:17:00]  Tevita wants in here.  Tevita!  Hey, what's up?  How's it going?  We're doing all right, Tevita.  You know, I was thinking about not joining the wild contest, but when I see these fat pigs  with double bunts, I'm thinking I could join and win.  You might have a shot.  I know these pigs are freaking horrible.  Anyway, I've been working on some impressions.  You want to hear?  Yeah, I guess so.  No impressions.  Ready?  Here's the first one.  Ready?  No.  Give up.  That's Jim Gaffigan. 
[00:17:30]  Okay, and here's my second...  Oh, that was pretty funny.  Here's my second impression.  Ready?  Yeah.  See if you can get it.  It's kind of hard.  Listen closely.  Act, act, act, act.  Punch me in the stomach till my uterus falls out of my glory hole.  Oh, that's pretty good, right?  I can't tell.  All right, next time, let me get out because I have like 30 lines to rip them apart with.  Okay, cool.  I won't be Frenchy.  I got material.  All right, we'll do that.  Later.  Bye.  Frenchy just really bombed yesterday against Voss.  It was awful. 
[00:18:00]  It was World War II all over again.  We might have to replay that.  That was funny.  Maybe.  You got cream.  Yeah, Frenchy bombing.  Not only do you just not go against Voss head-to-head like that, especially if you're  Frenchy.  If you do, you better come to the table with some stuff.  He not only had nothing, but Voss, you know, it was Voss.  He was able to rip them apart.  It was very ugly.  Here's what Voss is really good at.  Like, you can smash his stupid little midgety head for a while, but then as soon as you turn  your head, he stands up and stabs you.  He always, always comes back slowly. 
[00:18:30]  You got to really be careful.  Sandra.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  What's up?  Hello.  What's up, Sandra?  Oh, my God.  I'm from Philly, right?  Yeah.  And I'm just totally disgraced.  It's not even funny.  Everyone that's represented in Philadelphia looks like dogs.  I swear to God, Gemini is the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my world.  Well, not every girl from Philly is bad.  No, I like that one girl, Corrie, I think her name is.  Like, I've looked at her a couple days ago.  Kira's good with the glasses. 
[00:19:00]  And Corrie, right?  And Lily, we determined, wasn't that bad.  Well, I looked at her a couple days ago.  I'm not sure, like, I haven't been to the thing in a couple days, but I'm not sure about  the new people.  But, oh, my God.  Is Gemini a man?  Seriously, can somebody answer me that?  Well, I would love to get her, it, him on the phone because, and I'm not kidding when  I tell you, hundreds of emails coming in about her.  Yeah.  Because she's kidding.  Saying she's got to be a guy.  She has to be. 
[00:19:30]  It's no kind of, it's, it's, she's flat as a board.  It's no kind of boobage there.  Now the cheeks aren't that bad in the back, though.  That's a plum hanging from the back.  Yeah, there's like a.  Yeah, I noticed that.  And one's hanging lower than the other.  There is a yambag.  You're picky.  That's highly atrocious, and I just thought I'd.  I think Philly's effing with us.  I really think they're effing with us.  Just move the bag and keep going.  All right, well, I'm glad a lady's finally calling in to say that some of these ladies  are.  Yeah, because, I mean, I'm like, I'm not a lesbian or anything like that, but I'm just 
[00:20:00]  looking, I'm like, oh, my God, there's so many pretty people out here with nice boobs.  Can't they just come out here and just wow and then, like, make our city look good?  Because they're making us look horribly nasty.  Well, you know what?  We're looking for 100 girls, so there's still time to qualify for the wow contest.  All right, man.  Some cities faring a lot worse than Philly.  Believe me.  Yeah, I know.  Columbus!  All right, man.  I'm going to go.  All right.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Bye, you guys.  Sorry, I had something.  Yeah, I had a little Columbus in you to throw, I think. 
[00:20:30]  Quick break, Anthony.  All right.  Before we move on with the show, there's kind of like breaking news.  Our morning guy here in New York City.  Yeah.  He might get arrested tomorrow.  Yeah, what is this about?  I don't know, but I think there's like a sheriff that is hunting him down and he might get arrested.  Buford T justice.  We'll have the details next.  We're trying to get Scott Farrell on the phone.  Who knows the info?  Rick does.  Ben kind of does, right? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  It has something to do with Texas.  Philly.  Philly.  New York.  A car.  That's it.  Yeah, we'll give you the details next.  The Opie and Anthony F. Uline is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be made.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the latest from Filter.  Where do we go from here?  On the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:21:30]  Hello.  Well, we're trying to hunt down Scott Farrell.  He does mornings here in New York City.  Apparently, we're not the only ones trying to hunt him down from all the stories I hear.  We said from day one, the guy will eventually blow up.  Yeah, he will self-destruct.  It's not like normal on-air people blow up or self-destruct.  Like, this guy's whole life just self-destructs.  Now he's in trouble with the police.  Apparently, he owes people money. 
[00:22:00]  We love the guy.  We love the guy.  He's very talented.  He puts on a great show for us here in New York City.  But, man, I guess now the sheriffs are after him.  The sheriffs.  And Ben and Rick know the full story.  But I'm hearing there's a car that he was supposed to get back.  A car.  So they're trying to get this car back.  What I caught was the other day, Olive was in his office being yelled at by some sheriff from, like, Dallas or something. 
[00:22:30]  To say he was going to come in at 6 a.m. and arrest Farrell.  And it wasn't a joke or anything.  And Farrell was like, screw him.  I don't care, you know.  So he did something.  But he's got more.  Every day, there's new things with that guy.  He's got more problems.  All his stuff is in the office.  He owes hotel bills.  Moves up every other week.  He decides, like, from what I hear, allegedly, yeah, he lives in the office now because he just rings up these huge bills at the hotels and then just leaves. 
[00:23:00]  He just leaves.  That might be him, hopefully.  But don't you have credit cards you've got to put down?  Then he called some lady a puss or something, right?  Yeah, well, what do you call it?  The collection company, I guess, that helped the sheriff that's looking for him.  They issued the warrant.  Called him up because they know where he is.  They just found out where he was.  He's only been doing radio in New York for a year, but they finally found him.  And he basically says to her, well, I'm not going to tell you where the car is. 
[00:23:30]  It's hidden somewhere in Philly.  Come and get it, pussy.  So they called the woman a pussy and just, like, hang on.  Well, why did he just give the car back?  It's Farrell.  I think that's all they want.  Hey, shake it up.  That's all they want is the car.  They just want the car?  I guess it's some kind of car, and it's somewhere in Philly.  So what did he rent a car?  That could be a great radio promotion.  Find Farrell's car.  Find Farrell's car in Philly.  Is it a rental?  No, I think it's actual, like, a car that he purchased or something.  Oh, okay. 
[00:24:00]  And maybe he stopped making payments on it or something.  I don't know.  I did the same thing.  I was 22 at the time.  But, okay.  So he leased the car, and then he doesn't want to give it back, so he just left it.  I think it's like a 97 or something.  Because I guess, you know, you've got to make payments on those things.  Or else they take it away.  And then you've got to.  Yeah, then I guess he stashed it, and now he's challenging them to find it.  All right.  Now at least I kind of got what the story's all about.  But now they're going to arrest him tomorrow. 
[00:24:30]  But what does Texas have to do with it?  I guess that's where the original warrant is out of.  But why Texas?  Yeah.  It's Pharrell.  It's probably the bank company that owns the car.  Out of Texas, huh?  Yeah.  Dude, he also has a death wish.  He rides that little scooter.  Opie's old scooter, and it's, like, messed up.  It doesn't even steer right.  And you'll see him in the morning with, like, a stack of newspapers.  He's already had a couple.  And he'll just go flying in the middle of traffic, like, jig it up, flying down the street.  I guess he wiped out the other day pretty bad on 48th Street or something. 
[00:25:00]  On the Razor Rollerboard scooters?  Yeah.  And he goes against traffic down 56th Street.  He goes against the traffic in the middle of the traffic.  Jig it up, man.  What's up, Jig it up?  Don't eat Bloody Marys at Kennedy's.  You want to go?  Get a man out of, man.  Get a man.  Classic.  He's like, oh, man.  Yeah, we usually ride those scooters we used to up and down the hallway.  You know, no traffic.  This guy's out in the middle of Manhattan traffic.  Just flying down the road.  That's out of his mind.  And he carries.  The problem is, too, he's, like, using it with one hand because he carries all.  That is the worst with all these new cars. 
[00:25:30]  Rollerboard scooters.  So.  I would laugh my ass off until I dropped dead if I saw him take a header on the street  and newspapers go flying and him just go on his face.  How funny would that be?  It wouldn't even faze him.  So, I don't know.  And we haven't been able to get a hold of him.  Maybe we can promote his show for tomorrow.  He might get arrested.  Tune in, Scott Farrell.  Someone out there will go, oh, look how desperate any W is.  Now they're, you know, faking arrest and stuff so people will listen.  Shut up.  This is real life. 
[00:26:00]  What we got here is a blatant disregard of the law.  All right.  Maybe he'll call in today.  We got all sorts of messages into him.  He usually calls us right back.  Maybe he doesn't want to talk about this one.  Olive said he could be pouting.  Pouting?  Yeah.  Farrell doesn't pout.  Why, he just called you back?  No, I guess this morning he got upset about something else and stormed out or whatever.  Oh, God.  I just hope the guy holds it together.  We really like him.  We like him a lot.  Well, between him losing his mind and deciding just not to show up for work some days, you've got to watch that. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Sounds like when Anthony refused to give back the Lexus.  I didn't refuse.  I just kept getting extensions.  You know when they gave us the Lexus?  That was great.  Like, Opie got one for a while, and then they gave me one.  Brand new, you know?  And we're cruising around, and I just kept calling him going, look, I can't get in there today to bring it back.  You know?  But the soonest I could get in is next week.  And they're like, at first, okay, fine, you know, glad you're enjoying it. 
[00:27:00]  Then the next week would go by, and I just wouldn't call him.  And then I'd call him a few days later and go, ah, God, I couldn't get in that day.  Dude, I'm so busy, but I'm really digging the Lexus and stuff.  I can come in next Friday.  Ah, yeah.  Yeah.  Woo, great.  Just talk about it on the air.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm talking about it.  And it got to the point where I got a call.  Um, look, we need the car back.  Enough.  Like, I got the nasty call.  Yeah. 
[00:27:30]  This is great.  That just meant you loved the car.  I know.  They should have taken it as a combo now.  I was flying in every day in a Lexus.  You have a better car story, though.  When Anthony's done with his cars, he just leaves them where they break down.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I used to do.  When I had my crap, everyone's had the crappy car.  Have we ever found your old car?  No, we haven't.  Anthony's old car is somewhere between here, New York City, and Boston, Massachusetts.  It was in the Mamaronek area of New York where it broke down. 
[00:28:00]  It finally just, it always made this ticking noise.  It tick, tick, tick, tick.  It was a Dodge Ares K car, circa 1986.  Wonderful motor vehicle.  And it was ticking.  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.  But I always heard the tick.  And then it got to the point where I was like, hmm, is that tick getting louder?  I can't tell.  Well, so you just turn the radio off.  That's what you do.  And then it just made a sound like the engine fell out and lights, lighting up that I had 
[00:28:30]  never seen before on the dashboard.  Just, I was looking.  It was so many lights and smoke, I was looking for an ejector handle.  I was sure my fighter jet was going down.  Couldn't possibly be a motor vehicle.  Get me out.  Couldn't have been a car.  It was just frightening.  Then I made it up the ramp, getting off on the Mamaronek.  And, yeah, I went, I looked at the car.  I realized I, at the time, I had just about had the means to get a new car, but I was just  milking this for all it was worth.  And I realized, okay, now I just have to do it. 
[00:29:00]  Got the screwdriver out, undid the plates, and started walking.  Just left it.  Just left it.  And the best thing to do when you've got to leave your car, you go to the nearest  U-Haul, a rider place.  Instead of renting a car, because rental cars cost a lot of money, you could get a rider  truck.  It's one way, so you don't got to bring it back.  And it's like $19.  $19.  You haven't paid the deposit, but when you bring it back, so I just drove a big rider  truck back.  That's a great idea.  Yeah.  Not bad at all.  Works great.  Going back a little bit.  Dan from Hoboken, it takes a collection agent a year to find Pharrell. 
[00:29:30]  That says a lot about WNEW, huh?  No, Rick, I didn't torch it.  That wasn't my specialty.  I'd been around people, though, that torched their cars, which is just amazing.  A couple of guys I knew, they were into racing out there in Riverhead Raceway out east in  English Town, New Jersey, and they'd build their own cars and race them in one of the lower  classes.  They were jealous of this one kid in the neighborhood that had a really nice Nova, a little box Nova. 
[00:30:00]  And one night, they stole his box Nova, stripped it of all the good stuff, and burnt it.  Just torched it.  So I know what's going on.  Like, they told me they were doing this and everything.  I wasn't directly involved, but I had knowledge.  So they go out, and all of a sudden, I just, I hear very, very slight in the background.  Oh, my, oh, boy, they did it. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, man.  And you get that eerie feeling that you know where the cops are going when you're in on  a crime or something like that.  Yeah.  And, yeah, they torched it.  I never torched the car.  I would just abandon them.  Well, my dad would lose old cars like old pets.  I've told this story a few times in the air, but when my family was done with the family  car, my dad would take it for a ride.  Kind of like when, you know, your dog's getting old and stuff, and it's time to put him to  sleep.  Right.  And he has that job of taking old Sparky or Smokey or Fresca, in my case. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, a little Fresca.  For a ride, and then he comes back by himself.  What happened to the dog?  We've all been there, right?  And he comes up with some nice story about how the dog's now living on a farm in upstate  New York.  On a farm.  He's running free.  Well, my dad used to do that with cars, too.  With cars, too?  Yes.  He'd take the old family car out and just...  Would he torch them?  No, but he would do kind of what you did, just take the plates off and hope for the best.  Now, my dad, he got lazy in his old age, though, because, like, when I was growing up, he 
[00:31:30]  would leave the cars, like, on the Cross Bronx Expressway, which used to be a great place  to just leave your car.  That was good.  There were plenty of really good places around New York.  You've got to explain the Cross Bronx Expressway for, like, out-of-towners.  I mean, if you broke down on the Cross Bronx Expressway, let's say you ran out of gas.  Yeah.  And you've got to go to the next exit just to get gas and come back.  Maybe the trip, you know, will, maybe 20 minutes it'll take, okay, to get the gas, get back 
[00:32:00]  to your car.  Your car will be completely gone like a bunch of crickets attacked a...  Oh, ants.  Yeah.  It was like that.  Like a bunch of ants attacked a cricket.  They would take everything.  Yeah.  The black people would come out of the woodwork.  Well, you know, you've got to be real.  Black and Hispanic people would come out and just destroy your car.  They would take everything.  Everything, yes.  You would get back to your car.  You would have the frame left.  That's about it.  The doors are off.  There's just wires hanging out from where electronic equipment was and your tires, of course, gone. 
[00:32:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, yeah, there were plenty of places like that.  The Cross Bronx, though, very good.  It looked like the Highway of Death in Kuwait.  Yeah.  And they were all trying to leave back-to-back.  Oh, I remember that too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just see burnt-out hulks of vehicles.  They've cleaned up that area as far as that goes.  Yeah, you don't see as many...  You can't really leave your car there anymore.  Around anywhere in New York, you really don't see as many abandoned and ripped-up cars as  you used to.  But, so, back in the day, my dad would use, like, underpasses near, like, the river, and 
[00:33:00]  then the Cross Bronx Expressway.  Now he's, you know, he's getting up there in age now and stuff.  The last family car he let off, half a mile from the house.  Really?  In a parking lot.  I think it was, like, the friendliest parking lot up the street.  I'm like, Dad, what are you doing?  That's our car.  What did he do?  And then he would deny that it's our car.  I'm like, no, it's our car.  What are you doing?  Did you walk by and go, yeah, my whole family.  I should get my brothers on the phone, because they were still living in the house at the  time, because they were a bit younger than me. 
[00:33:30]  You just walked past the car.  And they would be screaming to my dad, like, Dad, why is the Toyota or whatever, you know,  up the street?  That's not our car.  No, it is.  He would deny it.  That's great.  It has the Harborfields High School bumper sticker on it.  That's our car.  What are you doing?  Nope.  No, it isn't.  Clever.  He never cracked?  No, he never cracked.  We were so embarrassed.  This is not our car.  But he never got caught.  This is not the car you're looking for.  That Toyota stayed in that parking lot for, I don't know, three, four months, and then 
[00:34:00]  for one day, it was just gone.  They towed it away?  They just towed it away, finally.  That's what my dad used to do.  Like the old pets.  He would get rid of the old cars.  Also, back in the ancient days, you used to be able to take your car to the local  junkyard, and he'd give you like 20, 30 bucks for it.  So as long as you could limp it in there, you'd be fine.  Now, I don't know what it is.  It's like, oh, you need all kinds of documents and the title.  Back, I remember taking a car there.  I had nothing.  There were no plates on it. 
[00:34:30]  I might as well have just stolen it.  You drive it in.  All right.  I'll give you 30 bucks.  All right.  Some weed money.  There you have it.  Brian's a repo man.  Hey, Brian.  How about Brett?  Huh?  Brett, you mean it?  Yeah, whatever your name is.  What's your name?  Yeah, I'm the repo guy.  My name's Brett.  Oh, what's up, Brett?  How's it going, guys?  All right.  You know, I got a horror story about a black guy who tore up a Land Rover on me, man.  I put it up, I booted it up, I locked it up on a wheel, and he came back, broke my stuff 
[00:35:00]  off, right, and crashed it right into a concrete wall.  Just because I was repoing his car, man.  I couldn't believe it, man, but that's how it works, I guess.  Who was responsible for the car?  Well, he still will be.  I mean, they'll just take it to auction and see if somebody will pay for it, but I doubt  it.  Yeah.  That thing is trash.  You know, there's a bit we used to do on the air, and we got it from Rick, matter of  fact, because I think Rick brought this bit to the table, where we had the repo guys,  you know, repo cars live on the air. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, pretty funny stuff.  Maybe we can get one happening today, we'll see.  Yo, hey, I'll do it for you, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, sure, I've got to be down in the Bronx a little later on.  All right, give us a call back, Brett, all right?  I will, I'm going to the Mets game first, so.  All right, hold on, hold on, because we'll call you back and everything.  Sweet.  We love this bit, we haven't done it in a while.  Gerard.  What's up, Gerard?  Hey, guys, Anthony, actually, this is a question for Anthony and Opie.  Yeah.  Did you guys ever hear of trade-ins, instead of just leaving the car on the side of the 
[00:36:00]  road?  Gerard, how long have you been listening to us?  Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.  We're pretty lazy.  Yeah, that's true.  And not only that, the cars that I had, there was no trade-in.  And the financial state I was in, I wasn't going to go buy a car on a lot or something.  Any car I got, up until 1995, any car I got was bought out of the newspaper for no more  than $500.  Every single car I owned.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I mean, you're knocked in for a living, right? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a plop, so I know how it was, so I guess I can't knock you for that.  I'm going to the paper.  Come on, your father?  Your father couldn't do it?  We were poor, man.  Oh?  We were poor.  My dad was pretty lazy, too.  Oh, well.  And like Anthony, we ran these cars into the ground.  I mean, that Toyota had, I don't know, 250,000 miles or something.  Ridiculous.  So they'd stop running, and then you'd get yourself another one.  How much are you going to get for that?  A couple hundred bucks, maybe?  Maybe, but it's worth a shot, right?  I coasted a pickup truck into it. 
[00:37:00]  I literally had, like, no transmission.  Let it coast in, and they gave me, like, a thousand bucks for the damn thing, because  it was a pickup truck.  Right on.  The first relatively new vehicle I had was my mother co-signed for it, and I just F'd  her over.  She co-signed for a Monza.  Remember the old Chevy Monza?  What an awful car.  What does it all have a Pinto?  It was a Chevy Monza, and it was three years old or five years old or whatever it was,  but still it was, you know, making payments and a loan, and my mother co-signed for it. 
[00:37:30]  I think I made about three payments.  Three payments.  And then just was like, eh, well.  Did they take it from you?  Yeah, that was the one I played the hiding game with.  Weren't you living in that car, too?  At one time, I had to live in that car.  Yeah, it was all I had.  I was working.  See, because I...  It was your home and your car.  The car cost me my job, which was paying for everything.  And the repo guy came to my job where I was working. 
[00:38:00]  I was working at some place out in the hop hog in the industrial park out there.  And the big repo guy comes, and he's a huge guy.  And he's like, I'm taking the car.  And I'm like, look, I was going to make that payment.  You know, all the lies that you tell and everything.  And I finally...  I talked him into...  I said, come back tomorrow.  I work here.  I will have the money, or I will hand you the keys.  I go, I will have the money.  I just need one more day. 
[00:38:30]  And the guy said, all right, I am coming back here tomorrow.  I quit my job.  I had to quit.  Because I knew I could get another job with the car.  But I couldn't keep going to this job without a car.  So I would have been fired anyway.  So I might as well leave the job, keep the car.  And then I had to hide it.  So they didn't know where I lived.  I changed the dresses every other week.  I was room for rent kind of thing.  And I'd park it all over the place.  Just camouflage it under a tree, in between two cars. 
[00:39:00]  Very far away from where I lived.  And then someone must have ratted me out.  Because they picked it up from the Greenlawn train station parking lot.  Yep, I came out one day.  I was like, oh, no.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, no.  Now I have absolutely nothing.  Okay, that was all I had.  Now I walk out and I'm just like, I have nothing.  Was your stuff in the car too?  Yeah.  So they took the stuff?  Everything.  They shipped it back in a big box.  They shipped it.  Well, I had a place to live at that point when they finally took it. 
[00:39:30]  But all the other stuff that I had in there, you know, the stuff you just keep in your car.  They sent it back in a big box.  Oh.  All banged up.  That's it.  All right.  We got to move on.  CJ, what's up?  Yeah, I finally got wowed.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I was down in Doobie, Delaware.  Yeah.  And I just want to say thank you to that chick because she had the nicest.  Uh-uh-uh.  All right.  She had the nicest pair.  Nicest pair in the world.  I saw the guy looking over.  I rolled down my window.  She leaned forward.  Lifted them things up. 
[00:40:00]  And it made my whole weekend.  See, Anthony, you really do win with wow.  That's right, Opelie.  Thank you, CJ.  Wow.  It really works.  Wow.  Wow.  So, get your wow sticker today.  Opelie, tell them how to get it.  Just send in a self-addressed stamped envelope to 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  And we'll send the wow sticker out to you and you slap it on your car.  Got to be in it to win it.  And you can win, too. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  We got some more guns.  Hey.  Whoa, Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hold on.  Let me get outside here.  All right.  You called us the other day, right?  Yep.  I'm the one from New Hampshire.  All right.  What do you got going on today?  Today?  Well, it's going to be the early day.  Got to get the kids.  But anyhow, tomorrow my partner and I are going to give you a, I call it a mad minute.  A mad minute.  Yep.  And what is that?  Basically everything we own, let and rip for about a minute.  And you're going to do it tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right.  Cool. 
[00:41:00]  Five o'clock.  All right.  Call it tomorrow.  Awesome Garrett there.  We'll have a 21-gun salute.  Pretty much so.  You got anything you could fire today?  Not on this site here.  All right.  Cool.  No, don't worry about it.  We'll talk to you tomorrow then.  All right.  Hook up a Garrickson and give me a call.  Yeah.  Hold on.  All right.  There goes Joe from New Hampshire.  That'd be good for tomorrow.  A bunch of people with their guns for, you know, the holidays.  All right.  We got to step aside.  When we come back, you thought we pissed you off yesterday. 
[00:41:30]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Muslim woman sues state over driver's license.  This is going to infuriate a lot of people.  Details next.  Opie.  He's a son of a bitch.  I'm sorry.  That guy's a rapist.  Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Thanks for joining us today.  Megan needs our help in Boston.  What's up, Megan? 
[00:42:00]  Megan.  Megan.  We lose you.  Hello.  Stone girl.  Oh, this sounded like it was going to be good.  Not there.  Hey, Megan.  Hold.  Maybe she'll pop back on.  One more try.  Megan.  Hello.  Hello.  No.  All right.  We'll call us back, okay?  Ash from Natick.  Anthony, tell the story about when you stole a transmission or whatever it was from someone's 
[00:42:30]  truck overnight and installed it in your own truck.  I remember this story from your Worcester days.  That was because I didn't have any money.  And I had an old pickup truck, an old Ford.  And I blew out the Universal joint.  On the drive shaft.  So I did what we all did back then.  We got in one of our friend's cars and scoped the neighborhood for a similar vehicle.  Had the tools.  Rolled underneath and took the drive shaft out.  I got tailgates for my truck when I banged up my tailgate. 
[00:43:00]  I went out.  You know, you get your set of tools.  You find a similar truck.  And you just take the part you need.  I did it with a headlight, light, you know, the cover, whatever.  Oh, cover?  I thought I was being all crazy.  It's kind of easy.  A little Phillips head action there and pops right off.  I thought I was being on the edge.  I was running down the street with a tailgate.  And I bang on my front door and my sister's there.  I'm like, let me in.  What have you got there?  Shut up.  It's stolen. 
[00:43:30]  Let me in.  We called it Midnight Auto Parts.  We got to go to the Midnight Auto Parts store.  And then I get in one of my friend's vehicles and we just drive around looking.  And then you just picture the poor son of a bitch, you know, waking up, going to work,  starts up his truck, puts it in gear, and goes nowhere.  Oh, well.  Megan, you back?  Yes.  All right.  What's up?  All right.  I have a question for you guys.  All right.  And you have to kind of bear with me because I'm in the office right now and the question 
[00:44:00]  I'm asking is kind of not good.  Okay.  Okay.  So listen, they just told me yesterday that next Friday I have to go in for a drug test.  Uh-oh.  What kind of work do you do?  I'm just working.  I don't want to say.  Well, you don't have to say where you work.  Just like what?  Just office work.  It's office work.  Why the hell are they drug testing office workers?  I know.  I know.  It's ridiculous.  It is.  So you got to get drug tested next week?  Next Friday.  I don't get that at all.  And the last time I, you know. 
[00:44:30]  So, hmm.  And hold on, hold on.  It brings up a really good point.  Yeah.  I mean, office workers, if you're just, if you're not doing a good job, then they should  fire you, whatever.  Exactly.  But if it's not affecting your work, then see them.  Yeah.  Then what business is it of theirs?  Now, if it's a guy flying your plane or.  Exactly.  Right.  Or, you know, he's the dude in charge of the subway, then, yeah, sure.  You know, test them, right?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm kind of, I'm peeing in my pants here.  Because the last time I, you know, was Tuesday night. 
[00:45:00]  Uh, pot?  Yes.  So you smoke some pot Tuesday.  Yes.  And you have to be drug tested next?  Friday.  Friday.  Huh.  I don't know.  How long is it staying here?  There are ways to beat them, too, I think.  There are things you can take to be drug tested, but I really don't know.  I don't know.  Me either.  Wow.  You should ask people.  There's got to be someone who knows.  I know.  I know they're pills, but that's like.  How long does it stay in your system, though, pot?  Pot is a pot.  I heard 30 days.  Yeah, I heard.  Oh.  But I think that depends how frequently you do it. 
[00:45:30]  I heard Coke is, what, a week or two.  That's it.  But pot is a lot longer.  What kind of test is it?  You got to, uh.  Pee in a cup.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Lovely.  Right in front of somebody?  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Go in the bathroom.  All right.  Well, then, just guess.  I'm not bringing in someone else's.  Why not?  Because they can tell.  How?  How?  I don't know.  Do they taste it?  Get your sister.  They taste it.  You get a little, you know, a little, uh, container that it can be put in, and you keep  it down your pants to keep it warm. 
[00:46:00]  I would smuggle it in the bathroom ahead of time.  Tape it behind the toilet.  No, but I'm sure the bathroom is in the doctor's office.  So I thought it might not even be in the urinal, funny.  I would definitely, uh, stash it ahead of the place.  See, I've never had this problem before.  This is what I get for leaving New York.  It's got one of the old-time toilets with the pull chain.  You could tape the vial behind it.  Behind it.  All right, uh, a bunch of things coming in, uh, Megan.  Uh-huh.  Golden seal.  Which is that?  No, but I heard they, when they test, they can see if they... 
[00:46:30]  Oh, now they've got to test the test for the thing you're using to cover up the test.  Other people are saying drink a lot of water.  That's what I'm doing.  Dip finger in bleach.  No, no, no, they test for that, too.  And then take a leak on the finger.  No.  Over cup.  Uh, then there's another product called Urine Luck.  Urine Luck?  That had a clever little name.  If it's true, it might be TJ just effing with us.  Uh, drink cranberry juice.  Uh-huh, during that.  Get detox. 
[00:47:00]  How about stop smoking pot?  What's that?  What's that?  Well, she's going to stop smoking pot until the time.  Well, obviously.  But it stays in your system for a while.  It stays in your system.  They faked her out there.  Wow, that sucks.  And the thing was, they were supposed to tell me 30 days ago.  Well, that would have been nice.  Were they supposed to tell you in advance?  Yeah.  Why?  Why don't they just spring it on you?  GFS works well, and they sell it at GNC.  GFS?  Erica.  G-F-S.  Okay.  What does that do?  Plunk down Erica.  Let me see what that does.  Okay.  Uh...  Hey, Erica. 
[00:47:30]  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  G-F-S, huh?  G-F-H.  H.  G-F-H.  And what does it do?  Can they tell that you're using it?  As far as I know, they can't because my boyfriend works at a pharmaceutical company,  and he passed two tests with it.  Wait, what is it?  G-F-H?  Yes.  And they sell it at, like, GNC and places like that.  It's a juice.  It doesn't taste that bad.  It tastes like vitamins or whatever.  Right.  Who cares what it tastes like?  Now, how expensive is it?  Save your ass.  It's like... 
[00:48:00]  I think it's 40 bucks.  Oh, my God.  Get a hold of yourself.  40 bucks to keep your job, you know?  I know.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Erica.  You're welcome, guys.  Thanks.  I wonder if it is.  Is this website for real?  Pete, go ahead.  Hey, what's up?  Go to passyourdrugtest.com, and they have, like, a huge selection of every type thing.  They got overnight shipping.  They got a guarantee.  Like, the GHS stuff, I've tried that.  That does not work.  Do not use that.  Like, it's not worth it.  Hey, but I don't trust those online things either. 
[00:48:30]  No, no, no, no.  Trust me.  Like, I'm telling you.  Like, I, you know.  And, yeah.  That's about all I can say right now.  It says pass your drug test guaranteed, but how are you going to back up that guarantee  in court?  Like, yeah, I was doing coke, but they said that no one would notice.  I'd like my money back.  They give you money back.  They give you money back.  I'm telling you, don't look at it.  What did they say?  F you, we're not giving you money back.  You're going to drag them in a small claims court?  That's funny.  I bought a drug test, and it doesn't work.  All right.  Well, thank you, Pete. 
[00:49:00]  All right, man.  Later.  You getting some good ideas here, Megan?  Megan?  Yes, yes.  You guys are talking my ear off.  As far as the online thing, the Internet is pretty much here to stay.  It's not a passing fad.  Relax.  And try UrineLuck.com.  UrineLuck.com.  All right.  One long, delicious word.  John, what's going on?  Oh, hey, I just got one of those wireless pager things.  They just sent me a message that the Supreme Court just ruled that they are allowed to do  random testing of high school students. 
[00:49:30]  I really don't have any more information.  I'm going to check it up on the web.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Testing high school students?  Yeah.  Could you imagine that when we were in high school?  Drug testing.  Why bother?  I think they would expel half the school.  Of course they would have.  All right, John.  Cheers.  Thanks.  Chris is going to help you out, too.  We'll take a few more of these, all right, Megan?  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, I was in the Army, and I got a drug test the next day, and high times told me just 
[00:50:00]  drink a lot of water.  None of that stuff works.  It's all a crock.  Really?  All you got to do is, if you know what time the test is, just drink at least two or three  gallons of water, and don't give your first sample.  Okay.  That's all you need to do.  I did it three times in the Army and once to get a job when I got out.  What do you mean, don't give your first sample?  When you get up in the morning, just pee, but don't go in with a fresh bladder.  Oh, that's perfect.  Pee a couple times before you go and drink at least three gallons of water.  If you get up like three hours beforehand and just pound water, that's all you got to do. 
[00:50:30]  What if I'm doing that for this week until the test?  It doesn't matter.  You can drink all you want, but you got to do it that day, because all it does is dilute  your system.  You can drink all you want.  Nothing will get it out of your system.  It'll just dilute it.  It's all you want to do.  Okay.  That's all you got to do is just dilute it.  Do you think I'll be okay with it?  You'll be fine.  I smoked the day before my last drug test.  All I did was get up in the morning and just drank about three gallons of water.  All right.  Thank you, Greg.  All right.  Thanks.  No problem.  Now it's getting confusing.  Mark says drink a cup of vinegar. 
[00:51:00]  Another guy says there's a product called Stealth.  You'd puke.  Fast flush.  Oh, you know what?  It definitely works.  I don't know if you want to do it.  Thanks.  Thanks.  If you drink some of my mule juice.  Quick.  I'm trying to help her.  She didn't want to hear that.  She's done.  That's it.  I'm trying to be a assistant.  You get your head held and...  We just gave her 50 ideas.  Well, that's the best one.  I guess.  Because then what happens is you'll still lose your job, but once you find out you have  age, you don't care about the job anymore. 
[00:51:30]  So the student law, the drug testing, they can drug test kids that are involved in any after  school activities.  Not just, you used to just be athletes, but now it's like, what, if you're in the science  club, they can drug test you?  In the chess club?  In the chess club, yeah.  He's using some kind of drugs to make them play chess better.  The debating club?  I'm putting crystal meth might help you out in the debating club.  You don't let the other guy get a word in edgewise.  And what happens?  They can drug test you now. 
[00:52:00]  No, I know, but what happens after that?  I don't know.  I guess you could think, what, you're thrown out of that club?  They can't kick you out of school?  The glee club?  Chorus.  Chorus.  They could drug test you if you're in Chorus.  If you're in the glee club, they should test you for a C and you're A.  All right, what do you guys think of this Muslim woman?  Ah, another bit of disgust.  She's suing the state over driver's license.  Here's the story.  Winter Park, Florida.  A 34-year-old woman is suing the state for suspending her Florida driver's license after she refused to have her photo taken without an Islamic veil. 
[00:52:30]  She had the veil on.  She just wanted, you know, a strange male seeing her, so she refused to take it off for the picture.  And now she's suing the state over that.  And she wins already.  She wins because the taxpayers are going to have to pay for that.  And just because she decides that her religion is being infringed upon.  And she's a convert. 
[00:53:00]  She was not even born a Muslim.  She's been a Muslim for five years.  And her stupid husband is saying, it's a reflection on September 11th.  Yes, stupid.  Good point.  It is.  Yup.  Is that what he's saying, though?  Yeah, and he's right.  A few murdering apples spoiled the bunch.  Too bad.  I don't show my face to strangers or unrelated males, she says.  Private.  Only her emerald green eyes and mascara showed through her veil.  Mmm. 
[00:53:30]  Hot.  What kind of a license picture is that?  Do the Klansmen want to have their picture taken with their little pointy hats on?  You idiot.  They will probably let this woman go with this.  I don't think so.  Not in Florida.  Good old boys.  No.  No.  Florida still has sense.  No.  And is there a case the ACLU won't take?  Is there anything that you jizz bags will say, no, we can't do this?  Oh, almighty.  The ACLU is shameless.  Oh, they picked right up on this one. 
[00:54:00]  And they're fighting tooth and nail for her right.  Did you see the picture?  It could be anybody.  It could be anybody.  She got a little slit for eyes and this big black veil.  What are the cops supposed to do, you know?  I wish I worked in that office.  I'll tell you right now.  Take the veil.  Take the veil.  Oh, that would be great.  There's some employees running out, cramming the veil of it.  No people will see me.  Take the veil.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, this is ridiculous. 
[00:54:30]  The only hope you can have is that her husband is like most of these guys and just beats the living crap out of her on a nightly basis, just punches her in the face and kicks her when she's laying on the ground.  Well, she's a convert.  She's, again, one of these people.  She's looking for attention.  She was an evangelical preacher beforehand.  Yeah.  And again, it's like that same vibe.  It's, please notice me.  I'm taking a stand.  I'll buck the system, you dummy.  It's for identification purposes.  It's not religious prosecution or persecution. 
[00:55:00]  Her husband, Abdul Malik, also known as Mark Freeman, is a white guy.  White race is really losing their minds.  The Freemans said they only want recognition that their interpretation of Islam requires women to cover their faces.  Exactly.  They're looking for attention and to make a point at taxpayer expense.  Hey, John, what's going on?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good, bro.  What's up, Norton? 
[00:55:30]  Hey, fella.  Hey, didn't this non-photo ID would work?  Wouldn't it for this Islamic pig?  I don't know.  I mean, somebody shoot her.  We're hurting the planes.  I don't know if they're allowed to have non-photo IDs anymore, are we?  I don't know about the licenses.  I'm from New Jersey.  You can have them here.  Send her out to Jersey.  I'll beat her with a baseball bat.  All right, John.  Thanks.  See you.  Bye.  It's sad.  I'm just reading over the story. 
[00:56:00]  They're white.  They're too white people.  Of course.  What do you think?  Of course they are.  And they decide...  Why would you decide to take up a religion and a look and...  That is just completely looked down upon in this country right now.  That's exactly why.  Because you want the attention.  Notice me.  Yep.  Hey, guys.  I'm different.  Well, she converted five...  I don't care if I'm persecuted.  She converted five years ago.  Let's be honest.  They weren't exactly the most popular folks. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  That's true.  It was always 93.  Remember the Trade Center in 93?  How could we forget?  Two years ago, a native of Morocco removed her headdress for ID, but her husband said she  did it only because she spoke no English and was unsure of her legal rights.  A native of Morocco?  As far as...  None.  You have no legal rights.  None.  Get off, stupid, or go back to Morocco.  Oh, mighty.  Refusing to remove her high...  How do you pronounce that? 
[00:57:00]  Who cares?  H-I-J-A-B.  H-I-J-A-B.  Her...  What?  H-I-J-A-B.  No.  H-I-J-A-B?  H-I-J-A-B.  H-I-J-A-B.  H-I-J-A-B.  Somebody will call.  Hey, that's my religion.  You're bad.  Shut it.  Hmm.  I don't even think the Islamic women could drive.  Women can.  Huh?  Yeah.  They're all awful, I mean, in those countries over there.  They're not even allowed to drive.  Yeah, take it to the limit.  Dude, I've had enough of religion.  Don't let her drive.  Catholicism, there's a guy who was arrested because he told one of his Catholic school students 
[00:57:30]  that if you want to have sex, you write, what would Jesus do on your junk?  That's absolutely true.  Are you kidding me?  It's in the paper.  Sunday school teacher.  What would Jesus do?  And that way, when you see your junk and you're ready to use it, that you would think,  what would Jesus do?  Yeah, of course, of course, a bird badge lift does not have the stupid page 23.  All right, we'll find it.  The priest probably wanted to write it on himself. 
[00:58:00]  Here, let me have a hold of that thing.  I'll just jot it down on there myself for you.  Oh, wait, I made a mistake.  Let me erase it.  Oh, oh, oh.  And they wanted him to write what?  What would Jesus do?  Man, that's a lucky fella.  All that room to write all that stuff you have.  I know.  After a shower, I would just have to put a question mark and remember.  What?  What?  Right.  Jesus, too. 
[00:58:30]  I'd have to write it in longhand.  And then somebody would think that you were just gay and you liked Mexican men.  What would Jesus do?  Scott, what's going on?  I have to over-explain that weak joke.  I know.  Scotty!  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Scott?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you know, this thing about if they should go to court, you know, people forget driving  is a privilege.  It's not a right.  You're right.  Think about if they do that with the driver's license, next will be the passport.  Are we going to know if there's a woman underneath that veil or if it's a guy? 
[00:59:00]  Think of all those bums that are going to be coming in here just showing their eyes,  nothing else.  Dude, you're talking common sense.  Of course you're right.  That's the beauty of the idiocy of this woman.  You know, when is it just going to stop?  You know, just enough of this crap, man.  You know, they're trying to kill us.  We've got to defend ourselves some way, you know?  Take them if you're not afraid and show us what you look like.  It ain't the conservatives, bro.  No, not at all, man.  They're the ones that are tying all these courts up.  We're out here busting our ass in this heat working just to pay for these son of a  bitches to do something like that, you know? 
[00:59:30]  It ain't the conservatives.  The hell with them, man.  ACLU.  Okay, Scott.  You guys are the best, man.  I listen to you all the time.  Thank you.  Take care, man.  The ACLU would never say, no, that doesn't make sense.  We can't take that case.  They are so based in this BS holier than that morality.  They are a disgrace.  They do good things, too.  But, man, can they ever draw the line and say no?  Ever?  Ever?  They will.  Dude, man, I am just getting pissed every day on the news with the Pledge of Allegiance 
[01:00:00]  and the VAIL.  Listen, if you don't want to do the VAIL and don't get a driver's license, then get the  F out of here.  When are people going to wake up and have enough of this crap?  Man, I get my paycheck.  Forty percent of it's gone.  I got a list of the people in VAILs whining.  I got to worry about how to make a mortgage payment.  And I got to listen about this.  Get on a camel, go eat monkey brains, and go back to wherever the hell it is you came  from.  Jesus.  Yeah, and taxpayers' money is going to this trial, you know. 
[01:00:30]  You know when those people, the immigrants, come over to this country, and I don't want  to blanket statement anybody, but you know they are given so much consideration to get  low interest, easy access to loans so they can open up convenience stores and all this  other bunch of stuff.  But if you and I, we, we, you know, it's just, God, it makes me want to pull my freaking  hair out.  I'm so tired of listening, bud.  If you don't like our ways, go live somewhere else.  Exactly.  Simple.  God, it's just like, what was that you said yesterday, Norton? 
[01:01:00]  I don't know, I trashed liberals a lot yesterday, so hopefully.  Yeah, I think it was, I think it was something like, uh.  Oh, my God.  That was pretty good, though.  Hey, Eric, what's going on?  Very close.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Hey, listen, I used to work for the INS.  There's actually a protocol that they do use.  It's very seldom that they actually do issue passports to Saudi Arabian women, but in the  rare event that they do, they take them into a room, and they do take the veil off in front 
[01:01:30]  of a family member, and they take a picture, and it's on the passport, and they just seal  the passport.  It's never opened unless it's needed.  So it does get done.  Why are they giving them this whole big to-do?  Yeah, exactly.  Take the goddamn thing off.  Or don't come here.  Take a picture.  Yeah.  Or, yeah.  Or, sorry, you can't come.  And Saudi Arabia, who we've supported, 19 of the hijackers, or 15 of them were Saudis?  Enough with Saudi Arabia.  I would tell you that, you know, less than 0.001% of Saudi women are actually allowed to 
[01:02:00]  get a passport, but those that do, you know, there's a way to do it.  We make all kinds of concessions, and we'll help you out.  We'll do this.  Meanwhile, when our troops are over there in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, those poor  sons of bitches couldn't get any porno.  They couldn't drink because they had to adhere to the Saudi laws that they protect.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we won't let the, the soldiers can't look at a playboy or a penthouse because they're 
[01:02:30]  in Saudi Arabia now, and we have to adhere to their rules.  Well, guys.  Well, then when they come over here, take the goddamn rag off your head and take the picture.  And the beauty of, the only advantage to that is if you have to adhere to the rules of that  country, if you're a military guy and you're married to a mouthy broad, bring her over  so you can savagely beat her in the street legally.  Yeah.  That's the beauty of being over there.  The female soldiers, when they went off base, which is ridiculous, you shouldn't, had to 
[01:03:00]  wrap themselves up in that garb because women aren't allowed to be seen on the streets uncovered.  So, meanwhile, there's women over there that were risking their lives.  You know, women died over there, too.  And they couldn't even act like they do in this country.  Yet, when they come over here, oh, we go to great lengths.  There's the ACLU to help them out if they feel they're being profiled or...  It's disgusting.  I never understood the idea of covering your face, either. 
[01:03:30]  It's like, how weak are men that you can't look at a woman without feeling sexual?  That, to me, is...  I mean, that's your mentality.  Oh, I can't handle it.  Cover yourself.  Get a hold of yourself, would you?  You know, they're all gay over there.  They're all gay.  You ever hear those stories?  They have that story.  What the hell are they called?  Like, they have their...  The little boys.  The little boys.  And it's a burr...  Oh, man.  They have their wives.  It's one of the best stories we did in the last year.  They have their wives that they used to have children with and to beat into submission. 
[01:04:00]  To just beat.  Then, for good time and sex, they have these young boys.  Yeah, but, dude, you can't point that out as the one good thing.  I mean, you know, every place has a positive, too.  Pete, what's going on?  Pete.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I just wanted to clarify a few things.  What you guys are talking about, especially this woman in Florida, is like a very strict  and strange interpretation of this lot.  It's more cultural than it is religion.  Okay.  I agree that she's definitely doing this for attention, but, I mean, hey, this country was 
[01:04:30]  built so people can come here and practice free religion, right?  Absolutely.  Yes.  And the other thing is, we don't beat our wives, man.  That's not true.  A lot of that stuff is just myths.  And, you know, just because of the climate after September 11th.  They beat their wives.  Come on, man.  I'm a Muslim.  I come from a Muslim family.  My sisters are all successful.  Well, my mother, you know, everyone, it's just, you know, there are sick people everywhere.  Dude, it's the fundamentalist mentality. 
[01:05:00]  It's not all Muslims.  It's the fundamentalist mentality.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Because you'll find fundamentalist Christians.  Let's not forget Timothy McDay.  Here's the difference, though, dude.  Here's the difference.  And you're right about Timothy McDay, Terry Nichols.  But when polled, most people who are of the same religion find what they did repugnant  as opposed to a huge support for what they did.  Like, if you polled, you know, that's the difference.  But that's outside of the country.  I'm talking about people here.  I'm Muslim, man.  I actually happened to be downtown when everything went down. 
[01:05:30]  And, you know, it's like this affected me, affected the Muslim community here just like  it did everyone else.  Have you been Muslim your whole life?  Doubly so because of, you know, the fact that we are Muslim and these people claim to share  our religion.  Pete, have you been Muslim your whole life?  It's kind of unfair, but, you know, I agree.  You can't hear me.  He's talking too much.  Pete?  Pete?  Pete?  Hello?  Pete?  His phone was dying the whole time.  Was that it?  Yeah.  It's not like saying, oh, Muslim.  No one's talking about that.  We're talking about this woman and just that fundamentalist mentality, which is aggravating.  She's a white lady looking for attention. 
[01:06:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mad at her father or something.  Oh, yeah.  I'll show him.  Hey, let's be alternative.  And her dirtbag husband goes to visit the family and they go call her by her given name.  And then she goes, no, no.  My name now is Achim Abadabafat.  Ali, at least, was sincere, though.  He wasn't doing it for attention.  He went to jail for three years for it.  Ali, you've got to respect him.  Tracy, what's going on?  I just wanted to call in about this woman that doesn't want to unveil her face for the  driver's license photo. 
[01:06:30]  This is ridiculous.  First of all, she's not allowed to drive.  If she's going to convert to the religion, she needs to convert totally.  And then if you want to tie in the Pledge of Allegiance thing, well, we're not allowed  to say it in schools.  We're not allowed to say under God.  It's not just my God.  It can be anybody's damn God.  So they should be allowed to say that.  And I think we should all just go over to the license bureau and wow everybody with  veils on so all they can see is our bodies.  Oh, breast pictures on your license.  Nice. 
[01:07:00]  Okay, then we wouldn't be showing our face, right?  All right.  Thank you, Tracy.  Thanks.  All right, we'll break.  Yes, Rick, I did say repugnant.  Also, we're learning this week spanking is a no-no.  Might get into that a little later.  Yeah.  We've got to have a little fun today, though.  We can talk about the movie you saw the other day, Ant.  The crappy movie I saw the other day, and the crappy movie I got roped into last night.  What a mess.  I haven't seen a good one in a while.  All right, but first, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. line. 
[01:07:30]  I want to give a little f***ing view to my white trash lifestyle because I went to a modeling  interview today, and they said that I was really sexy and that they really wanted to use me and  that I was really beautiful and I had a really interesting look.  But then they started talking about the cost.  It cost $500.  I'm white trash.  My grandparents said I got stuck with living after my mom ditched me because our dad did  the s*** out of us.  Yeah, see, they're white trash, and that means I am automatically, too.  So I guess I'm screwed over, and no one else is going to be able to see just how pretty I 
[01:08:00]  really am.  So I guess I'm just stuck in trailer heaven forever.  F*** you, white trash, though.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big f*** you to my neighbor across the street who walks around in his underwear.  Put some pants on you, stupid s***.  Nobody wants to see that, you motherf***ing ass clown.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big f*** you to myself for blowing all my money playing blackjack up in Reno  and ended up having to smoke f***y brown, bud, because I can't afford any green because 
[01:08:30]  I'm f***ing broke.  What's my problem?  F*** me.  Next message.  This is a big f*** you to the motherf***ers who don't even want to try to make it to  my birthday party this Saturday.  Oh, you people are intervening because the party was changed from Friday to Saturday night?  You want to go to the movies?  Oh, you got big plans, big f***ing deals.  Don't f*** yourself, you f***ing bastards.  Next message.  Lady Di from Chris and Lockbox.  Shut up!  Shut up! 
[01:09:00]  I'm gonna kill you!  Shut up!  End of messages.  Opie and Anthony.  At the last supper, they would have wiped their ashes with the tablecloth.  That's just what Christ wanted.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027.  W and E W.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Disturbed Voices.  I love this band.  They got a new album coming out soon, huh? 
[01:09:30]  When is that band?  I get paid, man.  When is it?  The end of the summer.  End of the summer?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I hope it's good.  I certainly hope it's good.  You got breaking news over there, Ed?  Breaking news over there.  We are your news station.  Breaking news.  What the F has happened to us lately?  I know.  Bring on the debauchery.  Well, we like to sprinkle that in, too. 
[01:10:00]  Federal appeals court judge puts his Pledge of Allegiance ruling on hold.  So, the same judge that made the ruling, all of a sudden, I guess he's feeling a little heat.  I think he's feeling a little heat.  He's feeling the heat of the sun on his back.  Exactly.  He's put his own ruling now on hold.  So, for the time being, until I guess he passes it over with some people and makes up his mind on this again,  it is still okay to say the Pledge of Allegiance with under God in it in public schools. 
[01:10:30]  So, that issue is done.  Christina, what's going on?  I kind of want to wow a whole group of guys that are working on the roof of the school that I work for.  Oh!  What do you do at the school?  I'm kind of like an assistant secretary.  Yeah.  Plus, I'm also an alumni of the school that I work at.  Oh, how hot is that?  How sexy are you?  All right, wait.  So, you're at work?  You see all these guys on the roof across the way? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, they're not across the way.  See, I'm downstairs, and they're working on the third floor.  Uh-huh.  So, yeah, and I've been trying so hard to get a hold of you.  I've been trying to instant feedback you, but since I work in the school, it's all fiber patrols, and that sucks.  And then I've been trying to call you, but my phone from my office won't get through to you.  So, now I'm like in a pay phone that the kids use from, like, the cafeterias.  Oh.  And I'm still in the center of the hallway, and I want to let you guys know,  that I want it to wow someone.  Man, you're motivated.  Really?  Jesse. 
[01:11:30]  We like you.  What state are you in?  New Jersey.  Nice.  Yeah.  All right, right, Jim.  Tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  No, they don't.  Let me just get it out of the way so we can do a stupid radio show.  They never do.  Instead of you, like, stumbling around the whole thing.  What?  Jim would love to converse with you, Christina.  Tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  Trust me, he would.  That's really not true.  I'm a nice guy.  Jim has a blast radius, and you fall within it in Jersey.  You guys are so awesome, and I want it to be like one of the girls.  His tri-state blast radius.  His blast radius goes all the way to the Mississippi River. 
[01:12:00]  Who are you kidding?  For all you ladies west of the Mississippi, you're F'd.  You're not within range.  I think it's really hot that she wants to wow at a school.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that is hot.  All right, so what are you going to do there, Christina?  So, I don't know, like, I'm going to see if I can take my cell phone up there, and hopefully  if I get reception, I want to call you right back.  Yes.  And then I want to tell you, like, what they all did when I wowed them, because there's  like seven guys up there that I can wow.  Well, is there a pinball machine?  Could you call us before you wow them? 
[01:12:30]  Um, yeah.  All right, do that, because we want to hear you do it.  Okay.  Hold on the line, okay?  All right.  All right, there she goes.  Come on, Rupert.  Hey, Anthony, you went to the movies recently.  Ah.  Wow, that's a good segue.  Whatever.  I don't care.  Out of all the great movies out there, you picked the worst movie to go see.  Well, explain.  I am a sucker.  A sucker for the trailer, for the movie trailer. 
[01:13:00]  No, no, no.  I am.  What you said in the back office is that everything else was starting, the starting time was weird.  Oh, it was a little weird stuff.  It was sold out, so at that point, I drive home.  No, no.  It was still a movie I kind of wanted to see because of the trailer for it.  It kind of looked cool.  It was a war movie.  No, it wasn't.  It was a war movie?  Who was in it?  Johnny Fontaine?  He will not get that picture.  Oh, no.  No, it was, uh...  It was, uh... 
[01:13:30]  Wind Talkers.  Ugh!  Wind Talkers.  That sounds as faggy as the Horse Whisperer.  The Horse Whisperer.  The Horse Whisperer.  Wind Talkers.  Will they communicate with the, uh, the smoke?  No, you idiot.  I don't know what it's about.  It's a true story.  In World War II, Anthony, did the wind say,  Hey, Anthony, would you like a Hummer? 
[01:14:00]  Maybe he takes on the sleigh.  And true story doesn't make it cool.  Boys in the Band was also a true story.  Well, it was a war movie.  When I saw the trailer for this...  It was a war movie called Wind Talkers.  Wind Talkers.  It was a very...  Well, it's one of those little obscure things  that many people didn't know about World War II  and the Japanese theater.  Once you go see, like, Minority Report, or... 
[01:14:30]  I mean...  What's a Wind Talker?  I'm sorry.  Did you go to the theater to see that movie?  Yeah, well, like I said,  the times were weird on other things,  and we, you know, wanted to get to a movie right away,  and that was the one that was playing right away.  We could have waited, you know,  40 minutes and seen another movie,  but it was like, all right.  And it was one, like I said,  because of the trailer,  I kind of wanted to see it.  The trailer shows a lot of Hellcats  and nice airplanes dropping bombs on the Japanese.  I'm like, I'm in.  John Woo directed it, 
[01:15:00]  so I'm figuring a lot of action,  a lot of good explosions and whatnot,  some bloodshed.  So what did the wind say, Anthony?  Well, the wind out of my ass says more than this movie.  You should have known,  because Nicolas Cage is in that movie, right?  Nicolas Cage.  Nicolas Cage, worst actor in Hollywood.  I don't know why.  When are they going to kick him out of Hollywood?  He has ruined so many effing movies at this point.  What movie did you like of Nicolas Cage?  Leaving Las Vegas, I like it. 
[01:15:30]  All right, you're right.  No, no, no.  You're right.  I like everything else.  He's awful in.  You know that movie,  Eight Millimeter?  I was telling you,  I would say it.  That could have been a great movie  if they had someone else  besides Nicolas Cage playing the part.  Well, he kind of makes Keanu Reeves  look like he has a lot of varied emotions  because I'm happy, I'm sad, I'm angry.  It's all the same thing.  Nicolas Cage does this twitchy thing.  He plays the same guy in every damn movie.  Yeah, except for Valley Girl with Deborah Foreman.  I thought he showed a lot of range in that one.  When Nicolas Cage feels pain,  whether it's mental or physical, 
[01:16:00]  he does that twitchy thing  where he'll hold his head and go,  oh, oh, oh, and be all like,  oh, my God, look at his acting ability.  He's awful.  And the movie,  saha-ha-ha-ha-hawked.  And why did it saha?  Well, let me give a little background  on the wind talkers, Jimmy.  Yeah, I don't know what that is, Ant.  The wind didn't feel like blowing that day?  No, it's...  Ugh.  The United States Army Marines  recruited these Navajo Indians 
[01:16:30]  from the reservations in Arizona  to use their language,  the Navajo language,  as a code that the Japanese could not break.  Boring!  Which they didn't break.  I don't know.  I think that's true.  I can understand.  All right, all right.  So they would use Navajo words for tortoise  when they were telling about  how many tanks were coming  and things like that.  And the Japanese just didn't understand  the language was so foreign  even to Americans, you know,  and to the white Americans.  The language is very foreign. 
[01:17:00]  And it was a great code.  It never broke in the code, by the way.  So it worked.  That's a blown ending.  It worked for the war.  It didn't work for the movie.  It was awful.  It was awful.  It was the biggest clich√© war movie  I've seen since I was watching those,  you know, war movies from the 50s.  They had the racist soldier in the squad  that didn't like the engine.  They have the big fight.  You know, the big fight about,  hey, red skin, you look like a nip.  You know, and they're beating the crap 
[01:17:30]  out of each other.  And I'm just...  What did the red skin call the black guy?  Oh, he...  No, he...  Oh, uh, there was no black guy.  I thought he was the black guy.  No.  No, racist guy.  It was the racist guy.  Like, the white guy from the South  didn't want to work with the engine.  All right, I'm sorry.  Didn't want him in the Marines, you know.  Goddamn engine, red skin.  Her, her, her.  You know, my grandfather took scal...  You took scalps off of people.  You know, the little battle  between the Indian and the white racist guy. 
[01:18:00]  Kind of just on Porky's locker room.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It's kike, you idiot.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah.  I'm kite.  And, and, and, you went...  Right when I saw him fighting,  I go, all right.  The Indian will save him later in the movie.  And there it is, lo and behold.  One of the biggest, like, war movie cliches ever.  Also, they go into a village  and there's little Japanese children running around.  And I'm sitting...  Before the scene even happened, 
[01:18:30]  I'm going,  if one of these mother effers  whip out a Hershey bar  and give the little kid some chocolate,  some American chocolate...  Before I got chocolate out,  there he was,  breaking off a little piece,  giving it to a little nip,  giving it to a little Jap kid.  The, the way the battle...  So I'm like, all right,  at least the battle scenes.  At least I can take away the fact  that John Woo directs some battle scenes.  I'll see some planes.  I'll see some gunfire.  I'll see some battle carnage.  You know,  I enjoyed the opening sequence 
[01:19:00]  of Saving Private Ryan.  Very real, realistic.  Very brutal.  You kind of got the feel of,  wow,  that must have been the living hell to be in.  So watching this,  it was like some half-assed Rambo movie  where Nicolas Cage is running  through the jungle  with the unlimited clip of ammo,  the movie clip of ammo  that never runs out.  Just shooting,  just raking Japanese.  That for some reason,  the Japanese in World War II,  I didn't know this, 
[01:19:30]  with all the things I watch  on the History Channel,  and I think I know a little bit  about World War II,  you know they never fired their weapons  at the Japanese?  They preferred to run,  to run at the Americans  and stab them with the bayonets,  no matter what they were firing at them.  So there's Nicolas Cage  shooting at about five Japs,  and instead of one of them  maybe ducking down  and taking some cover  and taking Nicolas Cage's head off?  No,  they keep charging at him  with their bayonets  as he's just  grrrr, 
[01:20:00]  grrrr,  unlimited.  He's such a boring actor,  they probably thought  he was made of paper.  It's just,  it was awful.  Oh,  there he is.  There's Nicolas Cage.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  He,  he,  he,  he,  ah,  all right already,  stop.  It sucked.  It sucked.  There was nothing to it. 
[01:20:30]  The Indian guy,  at one point,  my,  my girlfriend goes,  in the middle of the movie goes,  is he retarded?  Is he like,  and she was saying,  is,  is that a retarded actor  playing the guy?  He went through the whole movie  with this dopey grin on his face.  Didn't matter what was happening.  Yes,  my people are helping  the cause of the American,  the cause in Japan,  and we were,  daaah.  Maybe he had too much whiskey  before he had to do his lines,  yeah.  That's always good to help out  the Americans, 
[01:21:00]  because they were so nice to you  when they got there.  You dope.  The Indians like to drink,  the whiskey.  And John,  who was American stuff  is always going to suck  because of the faggot  motion picture industry ratings.  You watch his old stuff,  hard-boiled,  the killer,  that was good stuff.  Oh, my God,  it's Chinese stuff  with Chow Yun fat  was phenomenal.  It's all violence.  Hey,  I've got to interrupt  because Christina's  getting very impatient.  She's on the roof now  or on the third floor  or something.  Christina.  Yes?  All right,  what's going on real fast?  Okay,  because I'm like standing  right at the third floor. 
[01:21:30]  The guys are like  tarring the roof.  Somebody just noticed me  and I kind of gave them  like a quick squeeze.  They got to see my belly.  Yeah.  And then you guys  freaking had me on hold forever.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  Now I still have  somebody's attention.  I'm going to pound  on the window a little bit  and they're all going  to look at me  and I'm going to wow them.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So I'm going to put you  on speakerphone  and you're going to hear me.  Live wow.  Okay.  This should be great.  I'm getting ready,  all right?  This always works on radio. 
[01:22:00]  Is that all  going to look at me?  Hey, that's pretty fun.  Can you see me?  Can you see me?  Hello.  I don't get it.  Yes?  Hello.  Look at me.  What happened?  They're all going to play  and I mean they smile.  They're very happy, right?  Yes.  I made someone happy.  How big are those babies? 
[01:22:30]  34 feet.  Oh, what a good girl.  Thank you, Christina.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  That was good.  That was real good.  Love you, Christina.  A worse ending  than wind talkers.  But that's different, though.  She at least  showed her cans.  Good girl.  Hey, and then  you saw a movie last night.  I got roped into...  You missed minute by minute  last night,  which was great.  I know.  The Reagan thing. 
[01:23:00]  Reagan getting shot.  Reagan getting shot.  They did a great job  with that.  I got roped into this  because I thought  it was something  other than it was.  The promo  and the trailer  for this movie,  and I saw it on cable  last night,  so it had been out  for a while,  led me to believe  it was a police  action drama  where perhaps  some type of  supernatural thing  was involved  where the cop  gets help  solving a crime  from this guy 
[01:23:30]  who has some kind  of weird power.  Maybe he's involved  in the crime itself,  so I'm like,  all right,  this is...  I'm kind of...  I like stuff like this.  Sounds like unbreakable.  Like unbreakable  frequency.  There are just things  like a crime  drama thing  that has a little  supernatural element  in it,  and I was like,  all right,  I was a little  thrown thinking,  all right,  well,  J-Lo is the cop,  so perhaps  this isn't quite  what I'm getting.  No.  No.  But... 
[01:24:00]  No.  No.  Oh.  But no,  you did not  go and see that.  I thought...  You need an intervention,  man.  The trailer  led me to believe  that I was  seeing a movie.  You haven't come in here  in the last six months  saying you've seen  a good movie,  besides the obvious  ones.  And the title,  Angel Eyes,  should have led me  to believe  that perhaps  it wasn't.  I knew that sucked  from the poster.  How did you go  see that?  I thought it was  an act, 
[01:24:30]  a drama.  If you look  at the trailer,  the movie was  in the theaters  for maybe a day.  I know,  but I don't go  by that.  Where'd you see it?  You need an intervention.  At home.  At home.  Big Kev backed  me up on this one.  The trailer  for the movie  led you to believe  there was shooting,  there was a crime,  there was something  that had to be...  He's not helping you.  No, the trailer  didn't make me think that.  You're on your own.  At all.  The trailer...  You know why?  I didn't know  it was a love story.  Here's how the trailer  didn't make me think that. 
[01:25:00]  As soon as it's starring  Jennifer Lopez,  I tune out.  I don't know  what else it said.  Why would you watch  her in a movie?  Well, that goddamn  other movie  with Private Pyle in it.  With Vincent D'Onofrio.  Yes, that was decent.  Wait, which one?  Vincent D'Onofrio.  What?  The Cell.  Oh, The Cell.  She was good in The Cell.  It was decent.  You're right.  She was uneventful  in The Cell.  It was an interesting story.  It wasn't all right.  I thought perhaps  this was going to be  the same where  I don't care about her  or anything like that,  but I thought it was  what it...  I swear to you,  I thought it was 
[01:25:30]  a police drama action movie.  So why did you keep watching?  Because I realized  too late...  You were so different than me.  Have you ever sat  through a movie, though?  And then at one point,  out loud, I said,  oh my God,  I'm watching a chick flick.  I've given up on movies  with ten minutes to go.  Ten minutes to go.  Oh, yeah,  because I finally had it.  Sometimes ten minutes in,  sometimes half the movie's done  and I finally give in.  No, I make a commitment  to a movie.  Why?  Usually.  It's like a relationship.  Usually.  You put the time in,  you don't want to blow it. 
[01:26:00]  Because by the time I realized,  oh my God,  nothing's going to happen,  this isn't going to be  this weird thing,  this is a god-awful love story,  some guy loses his family  in a car wreck  and I thought that gave him  some kind of wacky power?  No.  But at the beginning,  they lead you to believe that.  Jennifer Lopez,  meanwhile,  he saves her.  There are some gangsters,  you know,  shoot a bunch of cops.  They put the gun to her chest,  pull the trigger,  the vest saves her,  put the gun to her face  and this guy that  had his family killed 
[01:26:30]  comes running out of nowhere,  knocks the guy over  and saves her life.  So I'm thinking,  how does he know to be here?  What kind of supernatural  things going on?  Are we going to get some action?  Maybe he's going to help out  on a crime that she's got.  Nothing.  Nothing.  The rest of the movie was  those two learning about each other  and her getting him  through this point in his life  where he didn't want to realize  or recognize that he had lost his family.  He blacked it out  and she helped him realize  that he has to move on with his life  and she is part of his life.  And J-Lo's part  was that her family, 
[01:27:00]  she's a cop  and had to arrest her father  for spousal abuse  and her getting a relationship  back with her father  was the other half of the movie.  And I'm sitting there like,  oh my God,  I'm in a chick flick.  I'm ass deep in a chick flick.  Are you still talking to me?  Oh, sorry.  You lost me 10 minutes.  What's the matter, dude?  There were no copies  of A Dangerous Mind  you could get at Blockbuster?  That's hard.  Even the way you're describing  the sci-fi animals.  It was awful.  I thought,  yeah, was she at least naked?  No.  No. 
[01:27:30]  The most we saw was J-Lo  in like a...  A teddy?  Like a small top,  but nothing big, no.  I don't care if she's naked.  And her big, wide hips.  Oh, that's nice.  But I got roped in.  You need to find  a new video game, man.  Roped in.  You're watching  so many crappy movies.  You need a new video game.  I can't turn movies off  unless they're completely god...  No, it was god-awful.  That's a sickness.  Like I said...  That's a sickness.  By the time I realized  nothing was going to happen,  I looked at the clock  and went,  oh my God,  this movie's over. 
[01:28:00]  It's like over  and nothing's happened.  Rent 52 pickup.  You got Vanity  looking very sexy  in a skimpy outfit  and Clarence Williams III  trying to smother her  to death with a pillow.  All right, that's good.  Roy Scheider and Margaret,  that's a great movie.  Josh, what's up?  Yo, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Dude, I'm pissed off, man.  I didn't turn on my radio  to hear fag movies here.  I didn't know.  Oh, come on.  There's no excuse, Anthony.  Anything with her  is going to be awful.  I don't care  if there's a sci-fi cop angle, 
[01:28:30]  it's going to be terrible anyway.  And you know something else?  In that movie,  she had a contract  not to do nude scenes,  so you're not even getting anything.  And there was nothing else on.  Let me say that.  Yes, there was.  That I didn't know about.  I was programming.  Only five minutes.  But I was looking  for a movie to watch.  I missed that.  It was one of those things  where I just tuned it in  and it's like,  okay,  I kind of know  what this is about,  but I didn't.  I know.  It was horrible.  This time,  you're never getting back.  I'm a total waste.  You could have been  talking to your little friend 
[01:29:00]  Jimmy Norton  or making some other  valuable family connections  or getting in touch  with something in spiritual.  I should have known  Angel Eyes.  That's horrible.  That's what I call you.  Wind talker.  Wind talker.  How about stop  with the stupid  two-tidal...  I don't know.  And then you know  what else I saw?  That's Stunk.  Nice.  I didn't bail out.  I forgot what I was going to say  and I realized it's Stunk.  Another war movie  that I thought was going to be  a good war movie.  I thought it was going to be  on the lines of  an updated version  of The Great Escape. 
[01:29:30]  Hearts War.  Oh, yeah.  Two words.  Hearts War.  What?  All your films,  Angel Eyes,  Wind talker,  and Hearts War.  No, it's not two.  They made a mistake.  Hearts War.  An apocalypse now  is one word.  Hearts War,  I thought,  from...  No, it wasn't like  Heart.  The guy's name was Heart.  It wasn't  Hearts War,  like War of...  You've seen some  faggy movies. 
[01:30:00]  No, this was...  Wind talker,  Hearts War,  and Bruce Willis,  Bruce Willis,  in a POW camp,  Nazi POW camp.  That looked like  it was going to be good.  I'm thinking  it's going to be  an escape movie.  You know what  it turned out to be?  It turned out to be  a court movie.  It was a court movie.  They actually had  to try a case  in this Nazi POW camp  to prove that  a black guy  didn't kill  this racist white guy.  I hate court movies.  And I'm like, 
[01:30:30]  why hate them?  I know the one  you're going to say,  but...  What?  K-Mutiny?  What?  It depends.  There are some...  K-Mutiny was great.  Strawberries.  Strawberries.  They called me  Old Yellowstain.  The one with Cruz  and Jack there.  That was good.  What?  That was good.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sorry.  Injustice for All,  but that's not really  a court film.  I hate court movies  in general, though.  If they're good,  they're good.  If they have  Matthew McConaughey,  they're horrid.  Jagged Edge.  I didn't see that.  Yeah.  This one, though,  was awful.  It turned out  to be a goddamn  court movie.  And I'm thinking,  all right, 
[01:31:00]  from the trailer,  again,  I've been so misguided  and misled  by these trailers.  It looked like,  all right,  they've updated  The Great Escape.  They got a bunch  of guys  in the POW camp  and they're going  to get a bunch  of people out  because there is  an escape thing  that goes on  at the end  that they don't  go into at all,  but from the trailer,  that's what it looked like.  Someone's going to escape.  There's nothing  about a court drama  in the trailer  at all.  I was misled.  All right.  Soldier Story's  a great movie.  You ever see that?  The guy's dead now. 
[01:31:30]  Harold,  whatever,  black guy.  Oh, yeah.  He had Denzel Washington  in it and David Allen Greer.  Right.  Adolf Caesar,  who's now dead.  You know what looks  like a great action movie  that I'm going to see?  The Ya-Ya Sisterhood.  What's that?  Doesn't that look great?  This looks like  the worst chick flick  fag movie ever.  Ever.  Oh, yeah.  Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood  or whatever it's called.  I think you've seen it already.  No, I haven't.  God damn it.  It's in the movies  and I shan't ever. 
[01:32:00]  I think you might  have seen that one.  No.  I saw the trailer for it  and I'm like,  this is a movie  I will never see.  They couldn't even  mislead me.  Are you part of  the Sister Ya-Ya?  The Ya-Ya Sisterhood.  Wow.  I want to see that movie  Making an American Quilt.  Who are you going to watch next?  Captain Corrales?  I can't even read it!  All right, we're bailing.  God, chairman,  I blew a great line  because I can't read.  And I don't want to hear  from you, Opie,  the English patient  in the movie theater.  I never saw  the English patient. 
[01:32:30]  I thought you went  with Sandy.  I swear.  No, I fess up the crap.  I never saw that.  You were going to see it  but you were too busy  collecting leaves?  Is that what happened?  You did see  the Bridges of Madison County.  Yes, I admit.  That was the last...  I didn't.  No, I don't want to believe it.  I did.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  It was another film.  It was the Bridge  over River Kwai.  You got it mixed up.  Jim's holding on  to hope that his friends  are still cool.  Hey, man.  It gave us a week  of great radio.  Yes, I did.  Not only that I want you  to be cool,  I just don't want you  to be abjectly homosexual. 
[01:33:00]  You're not seeing  the Bridges of Madison County.  Can I put my film  in your refrigerator?  Look, Jim,  let me explain  something about relationships,  something you don't  know much about.  I do so.  I've destroyed a lot of them.  Yes, I do.  When you start  a new relationship,  you do these type of things.  You go to a chick flick  here and there.  You do this.  You go there, okay?  And then time goes by  and you figure out  ways to get out of them.  I haven't been to a chick flick  in many, many years now.  I do understand.  The last one was  Bridges of Madison County.  Yeah.  But you find ways around. 
[01:33:30]  Like, look,  you do this,  I'll do that  because I don't want to do this  and I know you don't  want to do that.  Well, yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah,  all right.  I'll give you it.  In a relationship,  you've got to sometimes  you've got to compromise.  But in the beginning,  you're definitely very faggy.  That's fair.  All right.  No, you've got to do that  when you're under control.  You want to win her over  so you do these stupid things.  See, look at this.  Anthony, I'll back you up.  I fell for the same thing  with Angel Eyes.  The only thing,  I watched the whole thing  until I realized  what was going on.  That's how they do it.  Billy on here on Line 9,  I got roped into Angel Eyes  too with my friend.  And Scott,  Memento was on 
[01:34:00]  opposite Angel Eyes,  you fag.  I watched Memento  before Angel Eyes.  So I saw Memento  again last night  which was a great  goddamn movie.  And I don't want to hear  about these guys  instant messaging in  that they fell for it too.  No one is just saying  there's only one retard  in the entire country.  I wouldn't fall for it  because it said,  what's the name of it?  Angel Eyes.  Who's in it?  Lopez.  Nope.  Not seeing it.  But if you saw the trailer,  you would have believed  it was something  other than what it was.  I would never see  a Lopez movie.  No, she's an action hero.  I don't want to say,  look, she should have  that big dumper in the air  with my nose  and they're trying to  guess what she had  for lunch. 
[01:34:30]  That's the type of movie.  I don't like female  action heroes  or basketball players.  I'm sorry.  There are certain things  men do.  You give birth  and you win the divorce cases,  we play basketball  and we make good action films.  Dave, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Yo, I am the ultimate  Nick Cage hater.  Really?  I hate that son of a bitch.  He is a horrible actor.  Horrible.  It's all the Coppola.  Another possible great movie  in Hollywood he ruined  was Con Air.  Con Air, yes.  The worst acting  I've ever seen.  Yes, because he plays  the same guy  in every movie. 
[01:35:00]  He plays a total retard.  Because a lot of people  are trying to fend him  like Face Off  Face Off was overrated  with him and Travolta.  Stop it.  He should have been  kicked out of Hollywood  when he did  Raising Arizona.  That almighty  Face Off stunk.  The birds at the end.  That's Shambu's trademark.  Raising Arizona, though,  he at least played  a different character.  Yeah, but  that was the first sign  of him being horrible.  I liked him in  Valley Girl.  Was he in my own private  Idaho?  That wasn't him, right?  I think little Jimmy Norton  should get all his parts.  When he was named 
[01:35:30]  Nicholas Coppola.  Yes.  Little Jimmy Norton  should get all his parts.  I agree, sir,  with the old apostrophe  after the first L  before the I.  Yes, sir.  Hey, Jim.  Not gonna work, fella.  Dan from Hoboken  brings up another good point  about the wind talkers.  Another cliche.  How about the cliche  of the two cultures  not understanding each other  till they play music together?  The universal language.  There was one point  where one of the Indians  carved out a flute.  He made like this flute  out of some bamboo  and he's doing that  some of that bad  Indian flute music. 
[01:36:00]  So one of the good old boys  comes over  and starts playing  the harmonica with him.  And they do it together  and it's like  the Indian goes,  hmm,  I do not know  if this can work.  the music  like a harmonica  and an Indian flute  but then before you know it  they're making music together.  Yes, Injun Joe,  it can work.  Uncreative Hollywood  faggot writers.  God, do they stink? 
[01:36:30]  Ah, we got Nicolas Cage  on the line.  Oh, really?  Hey, Nick.  Hey, Nicky.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Nick.  Nick Cage, what's up?  What did you think  of wind talkers, Anthony?  I thought it stunk.  Yeah, well,  let me tell you something.  At least I can tell  the difference  between a homosexual film  and a real film.  I'm not going to be  the one going out tonight  running She's Having a Baby.  I'm not going to run  She's Having a Baby,  you tool.  Are you sure?  I have never seen it. 
[01:37:00]  You know you've seen it  with Kevin Bacon,  you big faggot.  Nick, what?  The movie's name  is Angel Eyes.  Hey, Nicholas,  why are you coming out  on talk shows  and on award shows  dressed like Andrew Dice Clay  with the leather jacket  and the sunglasses?  Who?  I dress like Dice  and I have less hair somehow.  And why do you  sound like Keanu Reeves?  Because we're the same person,  you idiot.  Good.  I could come back.  All right, thank you, Ron Cole.  Later. 
[01:37:30]  What a rip.  He really is awful, man.  You've got to see  Wu's shiny.  You never saw  The Killer with Chai Young?  No.  I'm that hard-boiled.  Hard-boiled.  Is it in English?  Or is it subtitled?  The subtitle doesn't matter.  Yeah.  Forget they have  the English dubs.  Go with the subtitle.  I like some subtitle movies.  Dude, you see all  of Tarantino's.  You know Tarantino  at the end,  they're all like  just pulling guns.  That's all John Woo.  That's good stuff.  And Tarantino admits that,  though.  That's all John Woo.  Chinese film.  It's great.  Double gun shooting.  Like 50 guns come out  and they're all  pointed at each other. 
[01:38:00]  But he did it right,  and it was violent.  You know what's  a great subtitle movie?  Das Boot.  You ever see Das Boot?  Almost, but not.  The German sub-movie?  That's it.  That's a good one.  No fag movie there.  Just all men together  in a small place sweating.  Hmm.  That sounds like  you can't wait the way.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey, if you want,  I can pass my blockbuster  to pick up a copy  of Billy Elliot  or Vanilla Sky,  if you want.  I've never seen  Billy Elliot,  the ballet guy.  You're a slump,  you know.  I heard up  and it's a slump  and it's a bit  of chick flicks. 
[01:38:30]  It's a slump.  Did you say  Vanilla Sky?  That wasn't that bad,  actually.  Nah.  That was all right.  I'm telling you,  it was all right.  Tom Cruise has done  some weird roles lately.  I love it.  Hey, when we get back,  we've got to talk about  guy byproducts.  Oh, okay.  Why?  I don't know  what words  they're going to let us say.  That segues right in  from this segment.  It sure does.  Angel eyes  and male byproduct.  Could Bukkake Spas  be coming to a place  near you?  Hopefully.  Bukkake Spas. 
[01:39:00]  Bukkake Spas.  I love the details.  Nah, okay.  What should we go with?  Hey, this is Steve-O  and you're listening  to the Opie and Andy show.  Oh, what did I say?  Oh, did I?  All right.  Opie and Anthony show  and illegal street narcotics  are keeping me alive.  The Opie and Anthony show  1027 WNEW.  We're back with  the Opie and Anthony show.  Stashi wants in.  Hey, Stashi, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Where are you calling from? 
[01:39:30]  Central Jersey.  All right, right on.  So what's your problem today?  Well, I just wanted to talk  about the WOW contest real quick.  Okay.  Basically, you guys have to  stop ragging on girls  that come in, man.  I'd be in there in a second.  I got probably the nicest  rack ever.  Oh, see?  I knew it.  You know, you frighten  everybody away.  Then come in.  I agree with you.  Come in.  You're not hearing  the other side of this, though.  When we see a lovely lady,  we're like giving her mad props.  That's true.  They are Ralph and Richie raves. 
[01:40:00]  Stashi, we've been very fair.  Yeah, I believe you've been fair.  Trust me, I've seen the pictures, man.  Some of them girls.  We're ranting and raving  about the girls from Dallas.  There's a couple in Philly  we really, really like.  There's a couple in Washington  we really, really like.  There's one or two from Boston  we really, really like.  There's one from Sacramento  we really like.  Columbus is hurting really bad.  Most of the girls that came  down here in New York 
[01:40:30]  are hurting really bad.  So what's the problem?  Well, man, you know,  girls have this whole  insecurity problem.  Same.  And we always try to anticipate  how bad it's going to be.  Mm-hmm.  You know, so we just,  you know, me and a couple  of my friends, we were talking  about taking a road trip up there,  taking off work, coming out,  Oh, do it.  Please do it.  Please do it.  That'd be fun.  Sashi.  Sashi, what do you think,  what do you think  your biggest weakness is?  My biggest weakness? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  I definitely have that  ghetto booty going on.  Do you?  All right, so this is what I...  Baby got back.  Hold on, but this is what  I would suggest.  Some of these ladies  are being stupid  when they come down  to the radio station.  If you've got that  and it bothers you a little bit,  make sure the photographer  shoots you from,  I don't know,  the belly up.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.  What do you mean  you have the ghetto booty?  What's wrong with that?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, it certainly  seems to please a lot of guys,  but it doesn't necessarily  take the most flattering pictures,  you know?  Dude, here's the problem. 
[01:41:30]  If that's how you feel,  then I would just take  the pictures from,  like, the belly button off.  In a thong.  Take them in a thong.  Women don't know.  Women don't know  what makes them sexy  half the time.  And they think they do,  but they don't.  That is really sexy.  But if she wants  to be on the safe side,  there are some ladies  that would look even hotter  if they would, like,  blow off some of their  body parts in these photos.  Blow off, literally.  Well, you know what I mean.  I like a nice little  You know what I mean?  Ghetto boobs.  There's a few girls,  you know what,  if they went headless  in these shots,  they'd have a much better chance.  Well, no, I see,  that I don't think 
[01:42:00]  is my biggest weakness.  I think I can handle that part.  All right, so you want  to show the face,  you want to show the boobs  that you're trying to tell us  are the best ever.  Hey, they're nice.  All right.  I've gotten a lot of compliments.  Well, you got to...  See, she could come down there.  Yeah, you got to come down.  Yeah.  How about if we make  a deal with you?  No comments.  No comments?  Yeah.  We will only make  this special deal  with you, Sasha.  You will get your pictures done.  We will put them up  on opandanthony.com,  and we will not make  one comment about you. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  And how does tomorrow sound?  Sounds great.  Lovely.  We need some ladies  down here.  New York is really  letting us down.  Absolutely, man.  I'm disapointing everybody.  Are we in agreement  that the beast  that showed up yesterday  should have never showed?  Oh, awful.  All right.  That's just frightening.  New York needs  to represent a little bit.  We need to...  I explained earlier.  We need to get  some girls out there.  This girl,  she's calling herself  the flame.  Dude, I disagree.  Hold on a minute.  She had a really nice  personality.  Relax, dude.  She'll still give you a hummus. 
[01:43:00]  No, no, no, no.  She'll listen to the show.  Just relax, okay?  Oh, really?  She doesn't?  Oh, good.  We talked during commercials  and she was really nice.  And I felt like  I couldn't go after her  after I talked to her.  But she's hurting, man.  Dude, I liked her rack.  You know what?  This contest personality  doesn't get you anywhere.  Ah, she's right.  No, I'm talking...  I don't care if she kills kids.  I'm talking about  what she looks like  without a shirt on.  She had, I thought,  a nice rack  and I happen to like  when it looks like 
[01:43:30]  it's five below zero  constantly.  Do you have clock homework?  No.  Look.  Hold on.  I can't see anything.  Her body, first of all...  Yeah.  Look at the rack.  Her body is very Ruben-esque.  The rack is nice.  Look at that picture.  Look at the rack.  Which means I'd rather  bang Ruben Kincaid  than her.  I said it with confidence.  I look at Norton.  Norton puts a face on him  and just shakes his head at me. 
[01:44:00]  No.  No.  Ruben Kincaid reference  doesn't work.  White shorts.  You really did.  You didn't bail out.  I said it with confidence.  I do.  Look at this one picture  with her arms over her head.  I really like the rack.  Oh, stop it.  I'm not being polite for what?  All right, look.  Jeff is going to give you  confidence, Sashi.  Hold on, all right?  All right.  Jeff, you're talking  to Sashi and everybody else.  Hey, can't lose this one.  I was all over your website today  and so far it's a bow-wow contest. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, it was a bow-wow contest.  Sashi?  Yeah, I got some quality down here.  Sashi, we don't want to lose you.  You come down tomorrow,  we will not say a word.  When your pictures go up  on opianthony.com  and we'll give you  some fine prizes  for just showing us.  Oh, that sounds good.  Definitely fantastic.  We might have tickets  for Norton,  some tickets to see  some shows.  We'll figure it out  when you get here, all right?  Rock, Norton, you rule.  Thank you, ma'am.  Sashi, don't be scared, please.  All right, I'll try to see  if I can get off work  and come down and see you, boys. 
[01:45:00]  I'll give you another secret.  We're kind of harmless in person.  We're a lot braver  over the radio.  That's not the frightening thing.  It's getting down to the wall.  Oh, you're a potty mouth, too.  I like that sign.  You said that F word.  You're a dirty language.  I didn't mean to.  A lot of people are always afraid.  Girls I've talked to  are afraid to come in  and they're going to rip me.  I'm like,  they're actually nice guys.  They're not going to shit.  Yeah, no.  Sashi, we will not say a word.  We really need to get  more girls in this contest.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, you do.  Especially from New York, all right?  So come on down.  All right, I'll come down tomorrow. 
[01:45:30]  We'll have some fun.  Hang out.  All right.  Take some pictures.  Say hello to big Kev Rick  and little Jimmy Norton.  All right, thank you, Sashi.  All right, thanks, guys.  There she goes.  There we go.  I hope she shows up tomorrow.  See, that's how we've got to do things.  Yeah.  Some encouragement,  maybe a prize.  Sure.  We've got to tempt the girls in New York.  See if maybe we can get  Shirley Jones down.  All right, Norton.  Don't make me go back to tapes. 
[01:46:00]  We've all had our moments.  Dude, I've had some real duds.  John, what's going on?  I knew someone was going to  get me on this.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I heard it.  Who was your first Carson Opie  of the day?  Carson Opie?  You guys remember that?  Opie, a white boy from Centiport.  Stop saying mad props.  Good point, sir.  Did anyone else get a chub  when she said the F word?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you heard it on the phone.  Yeah, you're on hold,  so you got to hear that.  I love you guys. 
[01:46:30]  Norton, love you to death, guy.  Thank you, Andrew.  Have a good day.  As I said, mad props,  I wanted that one.  As you should.  Like, who?  Well, hopefully no one will notice.  I've never given props to anybody.  What is that?  Props?  What I hate is these asses  don't miss a thing  when they're listening to this show.  Sometimes you just hope  you can say something  and no one will hear it.  Right.  Just let that one go by.  Like a miscue.  My white buddy Steve  one time in the car  said,  word him up, doc.  I swear to God. 
[01:47:00]  Word him up, doc.  Yeah, we were all high.  And he's like,  word him up, doc.  And my buddy Kenny,  he's black,  is in the back.  And he really called him out  and embarrassed him.  You can't say things like that.  What?  Oh, it was great.  You just look silly.  Silly.  Mikey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I disagree.  The Reuben Kincaid line  was funny.  I didn't expect this.  This ain't going to die.  This ain't going to die.  The Reuben Kincaid line.  Dude, normally I'm 100%  behind any Reuben Kincaid reference. 
[01:47:30]  As most people are.  But I was feeling  more of a Bonaduce vibe.  Really?  Yeah.  I went with Reuben Kincaid.  Who knows?  When you're doing  a Partridge Family reference,  it's got to be  either Danny or Reuben.  But then again,  I got a little offended  because I figured  you would jam me  because I think  I love you  is a song I downloaded.  So I kind of took it.  No, I wasn't even  looking into that.  You fag.  Thank you, Mike.  Mike seemed to enjoy  the Reuben Kincaid line.  Chris wants to state  the obvious.  Chris, go ahead. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Aren't there models  in New York?  Yeah.  You know,  I think that chick  with a rag on her head  is hotter than half the girls  that you got from New York.  What city are you from?  Buffalo.  Buffalo's not even  representing in this contest.  That's because  they're all fat and ugly  in Buffalo.  We do call them  Buffalo Bettys,  don't we?  Yeah.  I can't wait  to see you guys  when we come down.  All right.  Cool, Chris.  We got to go to Buffalo.  We don't put them down.  There's actually some  You didn't live there  for three years.  They're called  Buffalo Bettys.  That's an exciting town, man.  I like a place  that's really cold 
[01:48:30]  over the summer.  It closes at 10 o'clock.  Buffalo's hot.  I want to live there.  Does it really close up early?  A lot of stuff?  Oh, 10 o'clock?  I was talking about  New Year's Eve.  I imagine earlier  in other places.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  The crowds were cool, man.  You got to know  where to go in Buffalo.  Dude, there wasn't where?  I'll tell you one thing.  You don't really drink  and party.  It really is  a big-time party town.  Well, how about  for guys like me, dude,  that have other addictions?  I don't drink.  I don't drug.  All right,  but I like prostitutes  and peep shows.  A little hole in there 
[01:49:00]  to get to know your friend.  Those are hard  to find anywhere, though.  Yeah, man.  Not in Jersey.  South Jersey.  Well, that's what I mean.  Around here in New York.  Like, I just love  being in New York  for the fact that  I've been in bars  where the door  is just shut,  you're drinking,  and then it gets  that weird blue tinge  to the sky  and you know  maybe it's time to leave.  You don't see that  anywhere else.  You go to Boston  and it's like,  you know,  don't get me wrong,  I enjoy going to Boston,  but those sons of bitches,  you got to start your night 
[01:49:30]  at 8 o'clock.  I was used to going,  you know,  10 o'clock at night.  You're like,  all right,  I'm ready to go out.  Yeah.  10 o'clock at night,  they're all sauced  and the bar's going to close soon.  You get the last call.  Ben's going to disagree.  There's plenty of stuff  to do in Boston.  You just have to know.  You got to know  after hours.  I'm talking about  after hours.  Believe me,  I went after hours  with Brewer one night.  You got to know  the right people.  It was insane.  Absolutely.  Yeah,  but not everybody  knows like all those,  I don't know  any of those places.  That would be a problem.  Boston, Boston.  Boston is crazier 
[01:50:00]  than New York  in a lot of respects  if you know people.  But you got to know.  I'm talking about  the average schmoe  that just wants to go out  and get a drink at midnight.  Well, you can't go down  and hang out in Faneuil Hall.  Faneuil Hall sucks,  you know.  It's like,  that's the worst place.  That's the touristy place.  But you got to watch  where you go.  You don't want to step  into a bar in Saudi either.  You can't go to Saudi.  Your ass kicked.  You can't go to Saudi.  I'm Irish,  I don't go to Saudi.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah, they do.  There are certain bars  in Saudi you just  don't walk into.  They're local bars  with their local people,  the locals that hang out in,  and you do not  set foot in there. 
[01:50:30]  Jim, you're pretty white  but you're not white enough  for Saudi.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not.  You're not the whitest  of my eyes.  That's Ben.  No, you're not.  Ben grew up in Boston.  You do not go to...  He knows the ins and outs  of the place.  You do not go...  You can't go into  certain bars in Saudi  unless you're brought  in there with someone.  You know them, yeah.  You'll get your ass kicked.  Your ass kicked.  They fight over there  to ask anyone that knows.  It doesn't matter  about how white you look.  I go in there  and just be friends.  Hi, guys!  And pow.  I'm here to say hello.  Hey, guys.  God save the queen. 
[01:51:00]  Wait for the gunfire.  They hate...  They hate new people  that walk into these places.  They also hate blacks.  Well, that's a given.  I thought that didn't  even have to be said.  Duh.  Jerry, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi, Jer.  Hey, I gotta tell you,  this show is wild.  I can't get over it.  You guys are great.  Thank you, Jerry.  Listen, hey,  I represent  PrisonersServices.com.  All right.  PrisonersServices.com.  And we want to write 
[01:51:30]  a story about you guys.  A story?  What's a story?  What's a story?  We really do.  Is that like a hotel?  We have a newspaper  that we put out.  And we need  some information  from you.  No, we know  that you put out  a newspaper,  but when do you  want to write  this story  in a paper  that you put out?  And by the way,  do you have any booty  or a parrot  on your shoulder?  No, seriously.  We want all your  syndicated stations  so that we can 
[01:52:00]  put it in our newsletters  and our company  represents prisoners.  Prisoners.  We put in  personal ads.  That's Liza Minnelli.  You put in  personal ads.  We do.  We try to get the guys  somebody to write  some pen pal.  I'm looking at your site.  Would you like  to be a pen pal?  Do you want to put  Opie's blonde locks  on the front page  to get some of the  convicts interested  in buying it?  I sure do.  It would be great.  Stop. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, excuse me.  You're a hero in jail.  Jerry?  Yeah?  I'm looking at  your website now  and I'm looking  at some of the  personal ads.  Some of them  are funny, aren't they?  I see a guy,  Rodney Doyle.  He's seeking a woman  and he describes  himself as sincere,  honest, black male  seeking a minded  woman to write.  He's in prison.  You're going to kick  out of some of them.  You really will.  Looks for a woman  who is sincere,  sensitive,  and doesn't mind  being bashed  in the teeth  when I drink.  Yeah, isn't it great? 
[01:53:00]  Or seeking woman  with kids  because I killed mine.  So how'd you get  into this line  of work there, Jerry?  Hey, you have to know  it's, you have to realize  it's interesting,  isn't it?  Yes.  Different?  Yeah, it's weird.  What is he in for?  Oh, oh, this guy,  Daryl Martin?  Yeah.  That is a big black man.  Yeah.  He's in for  possession of cocaine.  Expected release, 
[01:53:30]  8-2005.  I'm a black male  that's looking for  a nice lady to talk  and hope it turns  into much more.  I'm looking for  a kind and sweet lady.  Age and race  not important.  Just be honest.  And this guy looks,  oh my God,  imagine him in the weight room.  Well, let's put it this way.  Nobody will bother him.  Well, yeah.  So what kind of questions  do you need to ask?  Oh, we get all kinds.  No, I mean,  as far as Ant and I. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, what do you want  to interview us for?  Well, we need to  get around  where they can hear  your radio station.  Because it is...  Syndication behind bars,  Opie,  that's our next battle cry.  And like everybody else,  they need a little  compassion once in a while.  It depends on the crime,  though.  I got...  No, no,  I'll tell you  what's wrong with...  I don't mind  anybody who's an armed  robber in there  for drugs,  certain crimes,  but if there's pedophiles  or something like that,  or rapists, 
[01:54:30]  you don't want them  having any kind of things.  I agree with you.  I agree with you.  Oh, hold on.  Your show is so great.  All right, hold on.  Don't you want everybody to...  Pedophiles and rapists love it.  Jerry, hold on.  One of your big fans  is on the line.  Okay.  Tom, what's going on?  Hi, Jerry.  How are you?  Jerry?  Hey.  Hey, I'm a correction officer.  How are you?  All right.  Yeah, thanks for making  my job harder.  Huh?  Keep setting them up  with those personals 
[01:55:00]  so these poor women  can send packages  and contraband in.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.  People like you  make my job  a living hell.  Hell!  Oh, I'm glad.  You understand?  Hell!  That's horrific.  Hey, you want to email us?  Email us.  We're at news...  Yeah, at convict.com.  ...cruzinesservices.com.  Yeah, convict.com.  Hey, Tom, what goes on?  Oh, God. 
[01:55:30]  I'm sorry, guys.  Hey.  All these guys do  with these personal ads.  They email  or if they have  their computer access  or they write  to 35, 40 women  and get these packages sent in.  And all these women...  Oh, baby, I love you this.  I love you that.  Oh, don't forget,  send me that package.  And this is how  the contraband  is getting in.  And, Jerry,  I really want to appreciate  you being the conduit  for making my job harder.  Thank you.  Now I have a face. 
[01:56:00]  You're welcome.  I really appreciate  talking to you guys.  I just want to give you  a little...  Listen, I'd really like  you to email us  and give us  all your radio stations  so you could be heard  throughout the country.  Woo!  All right.  And all the institutions.  I think she totally  missed the point.  And you never know.  I might come over  and wow you.  You're 80.  I might wow you.  What are you going to do?  Take out your teeth?  You might like it, honey.  No, I won't.  I'll see you out, Maverick. 
[01:56:30]  Jerry?  Yes?  First of all,  Sheep Lover pointed out.  He goes,  Ha-ha, Tom and Jerry.  Tom and Jerry.  Which is pretty damn funny.  Now, Jerry,  are you going out  with some of these convicts?  No, I'm not.  Are you married?  Yes, I am.  Is your husband  a former inmate?  No, he is not.  How does your husband feel?  Is this a $64,000 question?  Well, I'm just asking you  a couple of questions.  Why did you get  this site together?  Why?  Because I just feel 
[01:57:00]  it helps some of them out  that deserve a little help.  It makes them a little happier  to hear the jokes on your show  and to hear what's going on.  And let's face it,  I don't care who you are.  You need a little bit  here and there,  don't you?  So if a guy,  if a guy brutally  rapes a woman,  you want him to be sitting there  having a good laugh.  Listen, listen,  I'm not saying  what they did  is right  and what they did 
[01:57:30]  is wrong.  If they're in there,  we definitely know  they did something wrong.  But it doesn't hurt,  does it,  to be heard  throughout the country?  All right.  Thank you,  Susan Sarandon.  All right.  Yes.  You take care.  All right, Jerry.  I can only hope  one gets out,  finds her house,  and just,  they gang rape her  and kill the children  I hear in the background.  I'm not really  a big problem with her.  It's my,  my problem is,  it depends on what the,  look,  I'm very concerned.  I just learned something  today, though.  What? 
[01:58:00]  From that corrections officer.  Yeah.  I had no clue.  I thought some of these sites  were like,  oh, look at this,  kind of nice in a weird way,  you know,  looking for companionship.  No, these guys  are looking for someone  to get,  you know,  send them stuff.  Get in there dope.  Right.  Any outlet they can get  to the outside world,  they can use to  maybe get them  some contraband.  Steve.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Steve is saying,  Obie, tell this woman  that Bill is dead  and see how she reacts.  She did sound like her.  Relax.  Bill?  She's going to pull up  her pants and wow us. 
[01:58:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  So now,  prisoners have to have  a certain amount.  First of all,  I've talked to guys  that work in jails  and there are certain,  like the people say,  why do they have weights?  Shouldn't give them weights.  Because from what I've heard  from a correction officer,  it works on the aggression.  They have to have something  to get aggression out  and that's one of the ways.  Yeah.  Yeah, there are certain things  in there that make  the lives of the guards easier.  Try painting.  Well, then you work with them.  You work with them.  I'm telling you  what the guards have told me.  That's what...  That makes sense.  It's the women 
[01:59:00]  that really get hung up  on these guys though  and marry them,  the murderers.  You ever hear about  those women that go in  and, oh, he's such a great man  and they wind up  taking up his cause  and those women  have mental problems.  Yeah, they do.  I'm talking about guys  that work in jail  and their job  is to keep order.  You know,  I guess they know  what they're doing.  Of course they do.  And they say  they want them to have TV  to keep them occupied.  Then there's people outside  who don't deal with them  going,  no TV.  All right, well, fine.  You work with them  and then see how they react  when they don't have a television.  All right, 
[01:59:30]  Manjuice makes women feel good.  We've got to get to this story next.  It's a ridiculous story.  Manjuice.  Thanks for calling  and here's the Opie and Anthony  F.U. line.  This is Bernie from Philly.  I'm going to give a big  F.U. to the Federalist Appeal Court  out in San Francisco.  I'm a veteran  and a professional firefighter  and you guys are F.U. mules.  Next message.  I want to give a big F.U.  to all the liberals.  They F.U. hate America's  capitalism, religion,  economic freedom,  everything we stand for. 
[02:00:00]  They're against  the F.U. status quo  no matter what.  They aren't interested  in solving any goddamn problems.  They just want to  start some F.U. change.  They want to bring us down  to the same level  as the F.U. Europeans  and will do everything  to serve their goddamn ego needs.  F.U. liberals and the Europeans.  Next message.  Yeah, this F.U. is for Mo Vaughn.  You worthless public strikeouts.  Ten million dollars  for a guy  you can't do anything.  You can't hit.  You can't steal.  You can't even put  your F.U. foot on the bag  when your ball's thrown to you.  You got the physique  of Star Jones. 
[02:00:30]  You worthless public large.  The only thing you're good for  is taking up two seats  in the dugout.  F.U. you, Mo Vaughn.  Next message.  You f.U. ass.  I was driving on the block  when I heard the  f.U. signage  that cooled over  and the guy's back  and he almost f.U. hit me.  F.U. you, F.U. you, F.U. you.  End of messages.  Keep the 14-year-old  away from us.  Have a drink.  I want to bang you.  This is normal radio, right?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  I don't know whether  the city and what  you guys have to drive down there  and bash your heads in 
[02:01:00]  with a baseball bat.  F.U. you, F.U. you, F.U. you.  Ram Jam.  Black Betty.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  John has a comment about  the WOW contest, Anthony.  Go ahead, John.  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, what's up with flame, man?  What?  Number 45?  Yeah.  He's translucent.  I didn't know flame  could be translucent.  It's a little saggy, too.  She has great headlights. 
[02:01:30]  You know, what's up, Norton?  Hey, fella.  How about aiming a flame  like aim1atoureatabullet.com?  Nice.  Oh, boy.  Dude, why would you...  You know what?  We're getting a bad reputation.  Rick just took pictures  of a really hot girl  that just entered  the WOW contest  here in New York City.  There's a girl  in the contest today?  Yeah, Rick doesn't  even share with us.  He's doing this  behind the scenes  while we're doing radio.  Like, what?  You guys are busy.  Norton's expounding  on the death penalty  during spots.  Whatever you guys are doing.  Where's the girl? 
[02:02:00]  She was completely naked, Ant.  She's gorgeous.  She's really hot.  And Rick's taking the pictures.  Holy mackerel!  And he doesn't tell anyone  that this hot piece of ass  is here.  Holy palito!  Sorry, she has a name.  Rachel.  Hi.  How do you?  My goodness.  See?  We're nice to the girls  when they look like that.  And Rick doesn't say a word.  He's keeping it all to himself.  I thought you guys knew  in one spot.  And we go to break  and he goes to me  and he goes,  wow, you just saw  what I just got to  take a look at. 
[02:02:30]  And I'm like,  what are you going to tell somebody?  I'm sitting there  and I'm like,  alright, you know,  and she'll attest  that I made her do  a lot of things  and moved a lot of furniture  around waiting  for you guys  to kind of walk out.  I didn't want to make it obvious.  Like, hey guys,  come check out the new...  We have a system, Rick.  When we got the hot girl,  you got to give the signal  and then we casually  walk out of the studio  like we have to go  to the coffee machine  or take a leg  or play a little pinball  and like,  oh, look at this,  a naked girl.  We act surprised.  Now it's going to be 
[02:03:00]  all awkward  when we try to get her  to take some clothes off  in here.  Take your top off, please.  I'll take my top off.  See, look.  Wow, she's a good person.  There you go.  Trooper.  She's a trooper.  Rachel, where are you from?  Poughkeepsie.  Poughkeepsie.  There you go.  Poughkeepsie.  Hello, ladies.  This is my friend Heidi.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  These are my breasts.  I'll say.  Wow.  Boy, those are beautiful.  Thank you.  They make me want to be  all touchy-feely.  Well, you can't.  Very nice. 
[02:03:30]  Thank you.  I do believe  we have a finalist.  Yes, finally,  New York representing.  Did you like to the competition, too, ma'am?  No.  Why as lovely as you are?  Yes, she's beautiful, too.  You're a dish.  She's very shy.  I'm too shy.  Aw, too shy.  Oh, stop it, you Kajagoogoo song.  Just enter.  No.  No.  No.  Rachel represented.  She's pretty.  Thank you.  I like shy.  Not only that,  I found out that they  usually take pictures  of each other.  Oh, really now?  Yes.  Are you two a little more friendly  than normal girlfriends? 
[02:04:00]  Are you gay or bi?  Bi.  Rachel's bi.  I'm straight.  Wow.  You're straight.  Yeah.  Sometimes we kiss.  But sometimes you kiss.  Yeah, that's how I am, too.  Sometimes when we kiss.  It's like,  what?  How could you be?  Only girls can be straight,  but you know,  I kiss other girls sometimes.  And everyone goes,  oh, but it's like a guy.  Yeah, I'm totally straight.  But no,  sometimes I kiss my friends,  my guy friends.  Oh, my God.  You didn't say my name.  Ted Stryker's girlfriend.  Look.  Yeah,  only girls can get away  with that stuff.  I know.  You guys like it. 
[02:04:30]  Come on.  We love checking that out.  Yeah.  Of course.  Very nice.  Wow, wait.  No.  She's so shy.  She's like,  no.  I don't want to do that.  All right,  now you guys are wrecking the show.  Do you dance?  I don't know what you're doing at all,  but...  No.  Someone else?  Wow.  No?  I'm a nurse.  Are you really?  Yes.  Could you take my temperature  with your fist?  The old-fashioned way.  The old-fashioned way.  She's very, very lovely.  Her pictures will be up  on opandanthony.com shortly.  Holy mackerel. 
[02:05:00]  Hey,  did the pictures come out nice?  Don't let her leave.  They came out great.  Okay.  She's going to stay here  to make sure they came out great.  Oh.  Oh, no.  I saw them.  I like them.  Are you a nurse, too?  No.  All right, well...  I work with computers.  Ah.  Yes, I'm the systems administrator.  There you go.  Do you do website work?  No.  All right.  No.  Chachi from Boston is screaming.  He wants it on the air.  Chachi!  Hey, you guys.  Hi, Angel.  What's going on with Boston, bro?  Boston blows.  The place is so dismal. 
[02:05:30]  No wonder why we're a second-class city.  I'm sitting there every night  until 7 o'clock  waiting for some girls to come by.  Last night,  I had two great women here,  Janine and Jillian.  Yeah.  Couldn't get them to take their tops.  Wow.  But this place blows.  Why wouldn't they take their tops off?  You guys got, I think, what?  Three girls on the contest?  Three so far.  But we started slow last time,  and then we picked up steam.  But I need to pick up some steam right now.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, girls,  go down to BCN  and get your pictures done  for the WOW contest.  We'll even throw some tickets in. 
[02:06:00]  Do I got to bribe these girls?  Yeah.  Do some bribing right now.  Okay.  I got some Creed tickets.  I got Weezer.  Smoking Grooves.  I got a bunch of tickets.  All right.  Come on down and see Chachi.  I'm single.  And I'll get you high in the stairwell, too.  I can't confirm or deny that.  All right.  I'm looking for...  Thank you, Chachi.  Okay.  See you guys.  Bye.  How many Boston girls  are in the contest right now?  Just one?  Just the one?  No.  You got Becky.  You have  the girl we met 
[02:06:30]  at the River Rave.  And I think there's one more up there.  All right.  Becky.  Oh, and then the girl  without the head.  What number?  With the Marilyn Manson body.  Yeah.  Lilith.  Yeah.  Lilith.  Ish.  It's Marilyn Manson-ish.  When Marilyn decided  to put the boobs in.  Bride.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Rachel's up already.  Wow, that was quick.  Yes.  Yeah, very nice. 
[02:07:00]  Let's see the job, Rick.  Oh, Rick, you did a great job.  Did Rick do good?  Thank God he came back  from your A-Ha concert  in time to take these shots.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We would have had...  Yeah, yeah.  Stinky.  Did you stop touching my arm,  you faggot?  That was Jim.  All right.  Oh, wow.  She is really sexy.  That's pretty sexy,  like she's ripping  that shirt open.  But she's smiling.  She's all happy  to be doing it.  Yep.  Here they are.  Yeah.  All right, very good. 
[02:07:30]  Good job, Rick.  Fresh back from London town.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Oh.  I was talking to Rick  about the A-Ha show,  and he just kept saying,  yeah, and I'm looking around,  and there's just all fags  all over the place.  Like, what do you think  they were thinking  as they were looking around?  Well, that's to mention  he was in a place  with all mirrors.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[02:08:00]  On the way to the  A-Ha concert,  did you stop off  at Big Ben  and rub it on your face?  Uh-huh stinks.  He said he had a good time.  What can I say?  I let him off the hook  with the hole.  We really did.  Years ago,  we would have just  pounded him for an hour on it,  but...  Ah, who has the energy?  Screw it.  It's like,  just call him a fag  and move on.  He goes,  there were the turquoise guys  that were there  dressed in turquoise,  and then he put his hands  over his head  and shook around  to describe the dance to me. 
[02:08:30]  What's turquoise?  I don't know, Rick.  Apparently,  there were some guys  dressed in turquoise.  What?  You were doing an imitation  of the turquoise guys dancing  at the A-ha show.  Hold on,  I gotta give the hot girls  another thing.  All right.  All right.  Ah-ha.  I don't want to talk  about a-ha anyway.  Go to opanthony.com  to see the latest contestants  in the WOW contest.  We gotta step aside again  to catch up.  All right.  We got a little something  as we go to commercials  here, though.  Another great bit  from Steve  from foundrymusic.com. 
[02:09:00]  And John.  And John, I'm sorry.  Check it out.  Let's face it,  your parents are old  and they've become a burden.  At Jimmy's Retirement Castle,  we've got two rules.  A, they're always awful  and they're always wrong.  Grandma can live out her days  in the caring arms  of our staff.  You 50-year-old,  one-breasted bag of meat,  just hang it up  and be grateful  that some of your friends  are still living.  Each day at Jimmy's  Retirement Castle  begins with a physical  therapy session  with Jimmy himself.  Guy garbage.  Shut up, stupid. 
[02:09:30]  Just listen to this  satisfied resident  of Jimmy's Retirement Castle.  I hate this f***ing place.  Nice language  for an old lady,  you filthy-mouthed,  poorly-raised hooker.  And if you're looking  to pick up  a quick inheritance check,  just order Grandma  one of Jimmy's  special cocktails.  There's AIDS in it.  Jimmy's Retirement Castle.  We love the old folks.  Just ask Jimmy.  I hate old, deluded people.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:10:00]  Rusty from Cali.  Rusty from the left coast  wants it.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, Rusty?  Ah, well,  I don't know  what you guys  are talking about  because, well,  you just started  your show here.  But I just want  to thank you guys  for making the world  go around.  And thanks for all  the Hooters  been showed.  Thanks for all  the Hooters  been showed.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, guys,  I really appreciate you  and you suck, huh?  Thanks, man.  You're welcome.  Later.  By the way, 
[02:10:30]  thank you to whoever  sent me this  Ozzy Osbourne live  at Budakon CD.  It's appreciated.  Good for Ozzy  coming out with a new  live CD.  I think he's doing fine.  He doesn't need all  the help that you give  him on a daily basis.  I love it.  I really didn't know  he had a new CD  coming out.  I was very psyched  when I got this  in the mail.  I was like, wow,  I did not really.  Good for you.  I don't know anything  that has happened  since 1990.  It's not true at all.  I happen to upkeep  with the news.  Happen to know a lot.  He did pretty good  with the news today.  Dude, I'm always  upkeep with the news.  He did real good  with the news today.  All right, we got the, 
[02:11:00]  we had to go to  the censors  on this next story.  So we're going to be  using words like  man juice,  mule juice,  hot soup,  man sauce,  baby batter,  yam bag butter,  sea people,  sea people,  banana juice,  how about eye redner?  What?  Does it redden the eyes?  Oh, you bet it does.  Honest to God,  I shot myself  one time in the eye.  It was like a bullet.  How did you shoot  yourself in the eye?  Why would you ask that? 
[02:11:30]  I don't want to know.  Well, maybe I was  going to tell you.  I want to tell you.  I happen,  at times it comes out  like very slowly  and like brr, brr,  like my mule  has a stroke  and at times  it shoots out  like the challenger.  Like a loaded gun.  You ever hit  the wall behind you?  Oh, yes.  Many times  over my head.  It's like a cobra  going,  not quite the girth  of a cobra,  but you understand.  Don't you think  you had glaucoma  for a second?  Oh, fuzz.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:12:00]  What's wrong with that?  Glaucoma is an eye thing.  Who knows?  Might have gone through.  Why wouldn't it?  Who knows?  That's when you know  you have youth  on your side  when you can hit  the back wall.  You know,  this is coming in  like crazy,  so I'm going to go  with it and see  what happens.  You got it?  No, this is  Timothy White's eye.  Timothy White.  The famous writer,  rock writer.  I don't know who it is.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, Dave, go.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Yeah, just heard  on another station.  I don't know 
[02:12:30]  if it's been confirmed  or what,  but they said  that John Entwistle  was found dead  in his hotel room  in Vegas.  Really?  Yeah.  We're trying to...  What?  Well, they would be there  because they're starting  their tour tomorrow,  but...  What, did he die  of boredom  listening to his own albums?  Oh, shut up.  You ain't here.  Oh, stop it.  I have not been able  to find any confirmation  on this  on any of the news sites.  It's coming in  a little bit here,  a little bit there,  so I don't know. 
[02:13:00]  Can't believe  that poor picture  from the Cardinals  died in Vegas.  What?  Nothing.  I'll take my bombing  and blame it on me.  What was his name?  Reuben Kincaid?  I confess,  it was just me  in a death mask.  Oh, boy.  All right,  so we don't know  what's up  with the John Entwistle  thing yet.  It's coming in  a little bit  here and there,  though.  Anthony,  so,  oh, my God, 
[02:13:30]  look at this.  They just chomped  the hell out  of this story.  It's a news story.  What?  We can't read it  like that, though.  No.  Because of the context  of our show, Opie.  We got a speaking code,  I guess.  Right.  So,  the headline reads,  hormones in  banana juice  shown to make  women feel good.  Oh, yeah?  In what way?  Well, Anthony,  in London,  hormones in  sea people 
[02:14:00]  may help to ease  female depression  because women  whose partners  don't use,  oh, we can't use  that word either,  huh?  Why not?  Don't use  protection  are less likely  to feel down,  Anthony.  Hmm.  Scientists at  the State University  of New York  suspect the mood-altering  hormones are absorbed  through the,  through the,  the peach.  The meat pocket. 
[02:14:30]  The one thing  that makes us  talk to you.  All right.  Through the,  sure,  the peach  and make women  feel good,  but they stress  that their results  are not an excuse  for unprotected,  we can't even  say that word?  Why not?  Oh, my God.  Banging.  Uh, unprotected  booty.  Booty?  It's just ridiculous.  Unprotected  horizontal bop  movements. 
[02:15:00]  Bop.  No?  And then it says,  I want to make it  clear that we are  not advocating  that people  abstain from  using,  uh,  uh,  bags.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, this guy  said who led  the study.  Clearly an unwanted  pregnant.  Can you say  pregnancy?  Are we allowed  to say that?  Can we say that,  sweater boy?  That clues everyone  in to what we're  talking about.  Following his rules.  Oh, God,  I don't know why  the FCC should  just,  all right.  Clearly an unwanted  pregnancy or a 
[02:15:30]  STD.  Mm-hmm.  Uh-huh,  which is me.  They had it spelled  out, but we have  to say STD.  It's a surly  truck driver.  Uh, would more  than offset an  advantageous  psychological effects  of, uh,  hot soup,  he added.  Hot soup!  The researchers  assessed the moods  of 300 female  students using  a standard  questionnaire.  A score of  more than 17  was considered  mildly, uh,  depressed.  Women whose  partners never  used the bag 
[02:16:00]  scored about  eight on the  test, while those  who never had,  uh, booty  without, uh,  protection scored  11.3.  Women who  weren't having,  uh, booty  at all  scored about  13.5.  Oh.  Are you still  following me?  Yeah.  This is brutal!  Depression in the  students who  sometimes or  never used  protection was  more severe the  longer they went  without getting  some.  Uh, wait, I  gotta, I can't  understand that. 
[02:16:30]  Depression in the  students who  sometimes or  never used the  bag was more  severe the longer  they went without  getting some.  I still can't  understand that.  I know.  Why can't I get  that?  Because the less  contact you had  with mule juice,  the worse you  felt.  The more you  had, uh, uh,  certain activities  where the mule juice  won't get all over  you because you got  something over the  mule.  Right.  Uh, but they feel  better when the  mule is unprotected. 
[02:17:00]  Uh-huh.  You can say mule  unprotected, uh,  and the mule juice  goes all over and  in every area.  They feel better,  it alleviates  depression, which is  a great excuse if  you're a rapist.  I was just trying to  cheer her up,  Doc.  The scientists  said they looked  at other factors  such as the use  of oral protection.  Mm-hmm.  What words did you  take out of there?  Well, I don't  understand the  childlike thinking  of people with this.  Why can't, you can  read this on NBC 
[02:17:30]  Nightly News, but you  can't read it here.  Uh, because technically  we're not a news  program.  So what?  What's the difference?  I think we did a lot  of nice news features  today.  Yeah, what a bunch of  faggots run this  country.  It is ridiculous.  The scientists said  they looked at other  factors such as the use  of oral protection,  frequency, uh, booty,  and personality type,  but found that none  could account for the  findings.  The magazine said  the results are not a  complete surprise  because scientists  know that hot soup  contains several mood-altering  hormones, including  testosterone.  Some of these have been  detected in a woman's 
[02:18:00]  blood within hours of  exposure to mule juice,  the magazine said,  Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  The scientists suspect,  uh, banana juice will  have the same effect on  women regardless of how  they are exposed to it.  That would explain why  Rick came back from the  A-ha concert in a good  mood.  Well, Ant, ready for  this?  Yeah.  Los Angeles, California.  Oh, no.  Where did this come  from?  It's, uh, Metro, 
[02:18:30]  sir.  Oh, boy.  John Antwistle, the  bassist for the legendary  rock band The Who, is  dead.  Oh, no.  Uh, the Clark...  How did it happen?  No.  The Clark County, Nevada,  coroner's office, uh, says  Antwistle died in Las  Vegas today.  He was 57 years old.  Antwistle's death comes  just one day before The  Who was scheduled to  kick off an extensive  North American tour.  Oh, boy.  The cause of death is  still under investigation.  Wow.  Damn it.  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:19:00]  Maybe he had a heart  attack in the bathroom  while his girlfriend  was sleeping.  That's a good callback  to yesterday.  Oh, no.  That does suck.  I wonder if he did  the Keith Moon, you  know?  Probably natural causes.  He was looking really  haggard, man.  Oh, that's a shame.  And that's confirmed, huh?  Think they'll cancel the  whole tour, or they put 
[02:19:30]  somebody else in?  They'll cancel.  Yeah, they gotta cancel it.  That's it.  No Who.  Why couldn't...  They'll come back and...  I don't know.  Why couldn't it have been  someone like Ozzy?  Because Ozzy's a real man  who can handle his drugs.  He doesn't just fall over  in a toilet somewhere  on the West Coast.  That's why it's not Ozzy.  Dude, don't start messing  with the Who.  I'm not.  Somebody said,  why couldn't it be Ozzy?  What am I gonna do, not defend them?  Live at Budokan, out.  Go buy it, stupids.  Now we're gonna get pissed.  Who's gonna get pissed?  Who is a much better band 
[02:20:00]  than Black Sabbath?  You're not gonna get me started.  No, they're not.  Oh, my God.  You're insane.  They certainly aren't.  They certainly aren't.  Oh, gee, sorry.  Ozzy didn't stutter  through my...  They stunk.  I think he meant to do that.  It doesn't matter how.  They were a good band.  I don't want to knock them  because Ed was a guy, man.  I don't want to knock the band.  They were a great band.  They're not better than Sabbath,  though.  It's Apple.  Stop it.  They're not.  Why?  Sorry, the Ozzy rock opera 
[02:20:30]  should have come out.  Name one band  that is better than Black Sabbath,  please.  The Beatles.  And I like Sabbath better,  but I acknowledge  the Beatles were a better  and more important band socially.  The Rolling Stones, I think.  One band post...  Oh, I don't like them better.  I like Sabbath better.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One band...  The Beatles is easy.  Sabbath is my favorite.  One band post-1970.  Better than Black Sabbath.  There are none that I like better.  Ever.  You can't admit that there was a better band  than Black Sabbath  post-1970?  What do you mean by better?  I'm very serious.  What do you mean by better? 
[02:21:00]  More influential?  I don't know.  I got my favorite bands,  but I can admit that  there were bands  that are better.  The Commodores.  I just...  Yeah.  That's a different vibe.  Cool in the game.  No.  I don't understand.  What do you mean by...  So, in your eyes,  Black Sabbath,  greatest band...  No.  ...since 1970.  Name one.  Zeppelin is on par with them,  but they're not better.  They're overrated,  but they're not better.  They're not...  Zeppelin overrated.  Yes.  They're insane.  Judas Priest? 
[02:21:30]  Well, Zeppelin...  Zeppelin started  in the late 60s,  but, I mean,  most of their stuff  came in the 70s.  Who else are we going to throw out?  Eric Clapton,  one of the most  overrated performers ever,  who's good?  But, I mean,  come on.  Layla,  it stinks.  That song is awful.  Terrible,  classic rock.  But there was a time  it was cool.  Exactly.  Into the Void  it is still cool.  Maybe the song still...  Maybe the song sucks today  because it's been 
[02:22:00]  overexposed all these years.  Right.  Well, that's the beauty  of Sabbath.  Thanks to faggot  classic rock radio,  none of it's been  overexposed.  Oh, I know.  You know something?  Except for war pigs  and paranoid.  I cannot listen  to an Aussie song  or a Sabbath song  on the radio  when they do  occasionally put one on  on the classic rock stage.  If I'm hearing  I just like,  I gotta turn the guy,  I gotta turn it off.  I love Sweet Leaf.  It's a great song.  It's underplayed. 
[02:22:30]  But how about  playing After Forever  or something  that we've never heard  on the radio?  There's a reason  why it's never  been heard on radio.  Yes, there is  because Rolling Stone  faggoty writers  run that area  of the business.  Yes, that's exactly,  you're right,  there is a reason,  that's why.  Mike from the Bronx  is one of the most...  Now you're going to say  Rolling Stone runs radio?  No, no, no, no,  I'm saying that mentality.  Rolling Stone magazine,  the one that just put  Ozzy on the cover  for the first time ever,  stinks.  Put the chili peppers  on again.  Yeah, they're influential.  They were!  How?  Everyone's been  taking their clothes off.  People have been  doing that since  before we had... 
[02:23:00]  A little more than that.  It's not.  One good song  about heroin  and we think...  Give it away,  give it away now.  That's horrendous.  Give it away,  give it away now.  Californication.  Hey, he took the word,  he put two together.  Ha ha,  elbow my ribs.  Boy, they're changing  the way we look at things.  Jim, this new  Chili Peppers single  will be ten times bigger  than any song.  Bigger means nothing.  The Third Reich  was bigger than Sabbath.  It doesn't mean  it's better to listen to.  Dude, I don't know.  Some of those speeches  are real go-getters.  I'm not saying  that aren't inspirational.  A lot of bands 
[02:23:30]  have been influenced  by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Really?  What good bands?  Who?  Which good band  with a faggoty little hat  that didn't die  when they were 27?  Sabbath influenced  every one.  Who wore faggoty little hats?  Whatever the one you know.  Wait, who wore  faggoty little hats?  Every rocker  since 1994.  They had those hats.  A little hipster hat  with the things dangling.  Wow, man.  He cares about the environment.  You know,  like the cool ski hats  with the things  coming off  like the Terminator hair.  I'm not out of my mind.  The Chili Peppers.  And Ozzy knew  how to dress.  Dude, I'm not saying 
[02:24:00]  that Ozzy is an entity  unto his own, man.  Come on.  You know that.  The Chili Peppers  are pompous.  They're nudity.  That's not hip.  Who cares?  They did the nude thing  one time.  Jesus, it was a while ago.  Why?  Why not?  Why, a little gimmick?  Why did Ozzy  bite the head off a dog?  Because he's an alcoholic.  God bless him.  Well,  Anthony Kiedis  likes his heroin.  Right.  Yeah, I know.  He sings about it proudly  and everybody thinks  he's deep.  He's fine.  They're all right,  but they're so...  Name one band  that's better than 
[02:24:30]  Black Sabbath.  None.  Post-1970.  No, the Who  were not better than Sabbath.  Yes, they are.  They're bigger,  but they're not better.  Why?  What made them better?  It's this common misconception.  Well, everybody says  they're better.  They're rock legends.  How are they better?  They know how to write  some good songs.  Talking about...  Oh, my God.  You're going back  into the 60s.  And the rock opera?  The rock opera stunk.  Tommy was a great album.  They hated it.  I didn't like the movie  or the soundtrack.  They had some great rips.  What?  Tell me a good riff. 
[02:25:00]  I'd love to know  what is a good riff  by the Who?  About the whole  Who's Next album.  The whole thing.  I never heard it.  Who's Next?  Why would I listen to it?  Because it's a great album.  It's one of the greatest albums  of all time.  Who's Next?  It's not.  Yes, it is.  Roger Daltrey is interesting  when he's remaking  Phil Phillips songs.  That's when I like it.  When he's singing  Sea of Love,  he's interesting.  Ugh.  Exactly.  You're tasty.  Jim, you don't know  who's next?  You don't know  who's next?  Have you seen that one?  Bob O'Reilly,  Bargain, Blue Eyes. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, jeez.  I won't get fooled again.  I'm not saying  they're not a good band.  You won't get fooled again  is a great, like,  classic song.  I'm not saying  they're not a good band.  What I'm saying is  they're overrated  and I'm right.  They are not.  Yes, I am.  They are overrated.  You're not.  They are overrated.  You're insane.  Because what happens  is they're overrated.  U2 is overrated.  Oh, my God.  Now U2 is overrated.  Stop.  Oh, my God. 
[02:26:00]  Sunday, bloody Sunday  was Sabbath, bloody Sabbath.  It's stolen.  Oh, my God.  I can't look at you.  I can't look at you.  We're embarrassing  everyone in this room  and yourself.  I can't now look at you.  I can't now look at you.  Not saying that U2  is not a great band.  What I'm saying is  How are they overrated?  This perception of them  at these geniuses, man,  who have their finger  on the pulse of the song.  No, they don't.  They don't.  They're good  and that's as far as it goes.  That is a great band  that will be around 
[02:26:30]  long, long  after people forget about Ozzy.  Dude, Sabbath's been around  for 30 years, man.  And I'm just going to say  30 years.  What's a great U2 song?  Did Ozzy have sunglasses  before Bono?  Ozzy was in jail  tattooing himself  in sunglasses  before that Irish liberal  fag was writing anything.  Why are you so obsessed  with Ozzy?  You're really starting  to scare all of us.  Dude, I didn't even  bring this up.  I didn't bring it up.  You guys brought it up. 
[02:27:00]  I cannot wait for Ozfest.  Dude, I'll be mellow  around Ozzy.  I'm not going to be  an ass around Ozzy.  But I didn't bring this up.  I am talking about it  because you're questioning me  about Sabbath  and I will always defend them  and I'm right.  Every album  conceptually was different.  And U2 didn't do that?  I'm not saying U2  is not a great band.  You're missing.  I'm not saying they suck.  I don't like them  but I acknowledge  they're a great band.  But to me,  this perception  that these social geniuses  and that everything  they do is brilliant  and original  Sunday Bloody Sunday 
[02:27:30]  is terrible.  No one heard it.  How is that terrible?  No one would ever admit  that everything U2 does  is brilliant.  Are you kidding me?  They put out some bombs.  What are some of the good songs?  Even hardcore fans  were embarrassed  by some of the stuff  they put out.  Right, and Sabbath  never put out a bomb.  Oh my God.  What bomb did Sabbath  put out from 68 to 78?  What?  Black Sabbath, Paranoid?  Look at his eyes!  He spoke...  Dude, what?  Psychotic.  Ben's cursing.  But dude,  they didn't put out  any bombs. 
[02:28:00]  Ben's cursing.  Name me one.  You're just a hardcore fan  so you love every song.  They're all great.  Black Sabbath,  Man's in Reality,  Volume 4,  Sabotage,  Technical Activity,  Never Say Die.  All right, yeah,  we saw that song  was a best of.  I'll accept that.  That's a best of.  And Live at Last  they didn't sanction.  That was a Sabbath song.  But they didn't put out  any bombs.  To answer your question,  none.  You are a pisser.  None.  No bombs.  None.  None that Sabbath fans  are embarrassed about. 
[02:28:30]  There's not one Sabbath album  I wouldn't love to hear right now.  Name me a great U2 song.  I mean, look,  I'm open-minded.  Name me a great U2 song.  Where?  You don't think they were...  U2 was inspired  by the life they led  growing up?  I'm not saying that.  That brothers write  these songs that are brilliant.  Dude, I'm not saying that,  but to me,  they are overrated, man.  How is Sunday Bloody Sunday?  I hate it.  Ben, babe.  It's awesome.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  How is that a rip-off  of Bloody Sabbath?  Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath?  Gee, I don't know.  How about if Sabbath  came out with a song 
[02:29:00]  that said Sympathy for Frank  and went,  hoo, hoo,  at the end of it,  you'd accuse them  of ripping off the stone.  But because it's U2  and it's a title,  they're untouchable.  So just because the title  is similar,  they're ripping off  like Sabbath?  There's a comma in it  and it's a lot more  than similar.  Maybe U2 could come out  with an album called  Masters of Our Own Reality.  Well, a master of reality  technically we pluralized it  and put our own in there.  You are so insane.  That is so funny, though.  You're insane.  He's killing me.  You're insane.  Dude, they're a decent band 
[02:29:30]  but they've been overrated.  I'm telling you that.  Are you back on drugs?  I never understood.  Dude, what is wrong?  I'm saying the same thing  I've never understood this.  Worship of U2.  Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath  and Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  Dude, when people talk about L.  Are they similar sounding songs?  I wouldn't know  because I've only heard  Sunday, Bloody Sunday twice  and it was terrible  so I don't listen when it's on.  So you would know  if it's a...  Ba-ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Yeah, I know it.  It's a different song.  So what's the big deal?  The title.  Change the title.  Why not? 
[02:30:00]  Hey, why don't I come out  with a film called  Guys in Black  about UFO hunters?  Why not?  It's different technically.  It was about a massacre though  and it took place on a Sunday.  Oh, lucky.  And he's singing about it  so that's like what...  And you know what?  If they could have got...  Because Sunday is the Sabbath  and if they were able  to get away with it  they would have written  Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.  Catholicism, Sunday is the Sabbath.  I'm living in a Spinal Tap movie. 
[02:30:30]  Exactly.  Where did God?  No, I don't say this.  I like Elvis.  I'm not an Elvis fanatic  but I do like him.  But I understand  the worship of Elvis.  I understand a lot  of the adoration  that he gets.  I'm not an idiot.  I understand the adoration  that a lot of bands get.  Well, I think some bands  are overrated.  I think the critics  have historically...  Name another band  that's overrated.  You said Zeppelin's overrated.  The Who.  Yes, in comparison  with Sabbath, they were.  You said Zeppelin, The Who  and You Two are overrated bands. 
[02:31:00]  Yes, they are.  Oh my God.  Yes, they are.  And Sabbath was an under...  The Rolling Stones,  I don't think  were an overrated band.  They came out with some bad stuff  but they came out  with some great stuff.  Name another overrated band.  The Beatles were not overrated.  Elvis was not overrated.  Name another overrated band, please.  Do you know any other ones?  Let me think.  Let me think of any rock bands.  I think the Chili Peppers  were overrated.  They were overrated.  Pink Floyd.  No, they were brilliant.  I don't think they were overrated.  I think they were probably...  Fans knew how great they were.  Pink Floyd better  than Black Sabbath? 
[02:31:30]  Conceptually, probably, yeah.  Oh, wow.  But do I like Sabbath better?  There's a chink in the armor.  Yes, but I'll admit,  I'm not going to lie.  Who do I prefer?  Sabbath any day  and any song.  But conceptually,  Pink Floyd was brilliant.  JD, what's up?  Jim Norton,  comedian, more gooder.  Jim Norton, rock critic.  Eat a bullet.  Dude, what do you...  Why?  Tell me why.  Tell me why.  What have I said that you...  There's only one band  that ever existed  is Black Sabbath. 
[02:32:00]  Everybody else sucks.  No, I didn't say that.  That's what you're saying.  Dude, I certainly am not saying that.  I'm really not.  That's not the way I feel.  I'm on Pearl Jam.  You should flip in your own puke  and crack your head  on a toilet.  They were terrible.  That overrated,  preachy, non-award-accepting  dullard Eddie Vedder.  Come on.  Can I ask you something?  Sure, baby sleeper.  What is the name  of Ozzy's new album?  Ozzy's new album  is Live at Budokan.  Oh. 
[02:32:30]  Cheap Trick did it, too.  Oh, what's it called?  Live at Budokan.  Oh, wow.  He's ripping off Cheap Trick.  Cheap Trick,  but not the most famous  Live at Budokan album ever.  You're absolutely right.  So what the hell  is Ozzy doing?  You're absolutely right.  Oh, I'm live at Budokan.  What's he doing besides  a hit show?  You're kind of hypocritical there.  That's such a hypocrite.  Why didn't he call it  something else?  It's more of a ripoff  than saying that  Ozzy at Budokan Live.  You know what?  You raised a good point.  That should have been  called that.  It should have been  named something else.  The album is going to be 
[02:33:00]  great, but you're right.  It should have been  named something else  because Cheap Trick  named it that.  He's not doing a hit show.  They're just following him around.  He's not doing anything.  Well, let them follow.  It doesn't matter, man.  They're going to follow.  That's the people missed  as he is.  Wait till here's  what you're going to learn.  When they do it with  other people,  you will understand  how great Ozzy is.  When they do it  with other people  and you see what  pompous asses  these people are,  the humility of a rock star  to let you see his wife  and kids screaming at him  while animals  vomit on him. 
[02:33:30]  They did it with  other people before Ozzy.  Technically,  this is an extension  of the whole MTV Cribs thing.  How come they never  give Sabbath credit?  They did one of the  first rock videos ever.  Sabbath Bloody Sabbath  And it's real world.  Thank you, Ann.  It's real world  with famous people.  Yeah, exactly.  The concept has been done.  Absolutely.  What year was the  first music video?  I'm not saying  it's the first one,  but it's one of the  first ones.  It was a brilliant video.  It was like 75,  which was 74.  It was Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.  It was a great video.  I want you to want me. 
[02:34:00]  This is off of Ozzy's album?  Live at Budokan?  No.  I gave you that one.  It's off the other  Live at Budokan.  I won't argue a point  just to do it.  If you're right,  you're right.  And on that point,  you were correct.  Hey, YB from Queen  says it all.  So Californication  isn't deep,  but Iron Man is deep.  I didn't say that.  Iron Man doesn't try,  A, does not come off  as being pseudo-deep  and the critics  are not calling it deep,  whereas Californication  is...  Who's saying  the Red Hot Chili Peppers  are trying to get deep?  Oh, my God.  The way people perceive them  is that these these  brilliant, deep, hurt guys, man.  And then this person writes,  I'm not taking criticism  from a man who hasn't seen  a movie in the theater 
[02:34:30]  since Casablanca.  Then you should give me  respect because I don't  go to the movies  because it's all garbage.  Look what poor Ant just went  and saw.  Wind talkers.  That's why I don't  go to the theaters.  Sorry, I saw Titanic.  Wind talkers, right?  What's it called?  Wind talkers.  Wind talkers.  I know that's crap  and I know Angel Eyes is crap.  That's why I don't  go to the theaters, sir.  You went to see Titanic.  Yeah, I did to see it  on a big screen  for the graphics  and it annoyed me so much.  And I knew it would.  You know, I'm a U2 fan.  I didn't know this,  Tom, from Massapequa.  Sunday Bloody Sunday  was the name given 
[02:35:00]  to the historical event  by the media.  You two didn't make up the name.  So what?  Black Sabbath was the name  of Boris Karloff movies.  I mean, they could sing  that song, too?  No one said they made up  the name, stupid.  You said they ripped off Sabbath  by calling that song  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Call it something else.  Call it that name.  The media came up with  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Okay, what the media  came up with.  And then they sang about it  and they called it  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  I understand all that.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't sway me one inch.  You're insane.  I'm not insane at all.  Do you think Ozzy  is influenced more 
[02:35:30]  in music than  a lot of these other bands?  Is he influenced  or has he influenced?  Has he influenced music  more than bands  like The Who?  No, I don't.  That I can't comment on  to be very honest with you.  I don't know.  Musically,  I only,  I think,  influenced a lot of people  on the vibe of Sabbath.  Ozzy himself,  I don't know.  I can't say this.  The Who may have influenced  and I was trying to,  I don't see a whole lot  of Who tribute albums  coming out by the band.  How about Zeppelin?  What about Zeppelin?  They were inspired  by The Who.  I didn't know that.  So what? 
[02:36:00]  Big deal.  Big deal.  There will be a  Who tribute album.  Who was Sabbath?  Who was this one?  Was there?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean tribute albums  where all the bands  that they've influenced  come up.  Yes, yeah, yeah.  And there were some  pretty big acts on them.  And Zeppelin was a great band.  No one is saying they're not.  But I'm saying  it's inspired by The Who.  When compared with Sabbath,  they have been overrated.  Yes, when compared with Sabbath,  they've been overrated  because they're held as,  like, everything they do  is considered brilliant, man.  They're in the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  and Sabbath can't get in  because of those  faggot Rolling Stone writers. 
[02:36:30]  That's what I resent  about Zeppelin.  I thought they couldn't get in  because Ozzy took his name off.  Why did he take it off?  Because they were  constantly being rejected.  He didn't just take it off  to be a silly goose.  He took it off  because they were  constantly being shot down.  So he finally said,  enough.  He's a sore loser.  No, he has dignity  and he said, enough.  I don't need to be in.  He said, okay, don't put me in.  And he took it off.  You're crazy.  No, I'm not.  Because they came to Ozzy  and said, we want to put you  in the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame next year.  He would jump at that champ.  Sharon would make him  because he's pussy whipped  to tell you the truth. 
[02:37:00]  Dude, let me tell you something.  When you have,  when you've tinkled  on the Alamo,  when you've bit the head  off a bat,  a dove,  when you've shot them  or all,  when you've strangled your wife,  nothing you do  is selling out.  I don't care  if he does a kid's show  with puppets,  nothing you do  is selling out.  That has nothing to do  with the music you make.  Of course it does.  Why?  You're talking about  depth and all that  and that's who he is.  That's who he is.  It has a lot to do  with the music you make.  Of course it does.  But how good stuff.  Queen was great, man.  I'm not saying  Queen wasn't great.  I don't deny 
[02:37:30]  other bands being great.  I'm not an idiot.  I don't say,  like, I love all the kids.  But he did some crazy  things on the side,  but he still put out  great music.  Sure he did.  I'm not saying  he didn't.  And I'm not saying  Zeppelin wasn't a great band  or U2's not a great band.  What I'm saying is,  this critical,  like this guy  mentioned Eddie Vedder,  that just really annoys me.  Because who you are  is part of the music to me  as far as I'm concerned.  It makes you interesting.  You don't think  Pearl Jam  was a very influential,  new...  Oh yeah,  if you like hearing  50 songs redone.  No, I don't. 
[02:38:00]  I never liked them.  You heard that one song.  Jeremiah,  whatever that,  it was awful, dude.  Jeremiah.  Whatever.  Jeremiah.  What's it called?  What's it called?  Jeremy.  I heard it  and I didn't like it.  That's a 50 song?  No, the other one  they've got the car wreck  that he redid.  Sabbath redid.  Oh, where?  Exactly.  Everybody.  Exactly, I'm tired of it.  He sounds like Cher.  He's Cher with hormones  and a stroke.  That's what he sings like. 
[02:38:30]  He's overrated  with his stupid  shoulder-legged hair,  khaki shorts,  his political agenda.  He does now.  He stinks.  What about STP?  I'm not as familiar  with their music,  so I cannot comment.  Stone Temple Pilots.  Never felt much for them,  but I'm not familiar enough  with their music  to comment on it.  What I heard,  I really didn't remember liking,  but again,  maybe if I heard more.  I'm not familiar  with Green Day.  I told you,  I thought Outkast  was white.  I had no idea  they were black.  You should have been born  like years ago.  Why?  And just,  because your whole, 
[02:39:00]  it sounds like  I'm arguing  with a 55-year-old man.  But I'll grant you,  if you make a point,  I'm not going to be dishonest.  No, I understand,  but your taste in music  is that of a 55-year-old man.  I love Ozzy.  What are you talking about?  I love Dan Byrne,  who's new.  Well, I love a lot of bands.  You know,  he's not really mainstream.  He's good.  He's the guy I like.  All right.  I don't need to go.  Sorry,  I can't jump on  the yellow sunglasses  Bono bandwagon.  I can't do it.  You only like Ozzy.  No, I don't.  No, I don't. 
[02:39:30]  And we think  that's a problem.  Dude,  I like a lot of bands.  Name five bands you like.  Metallica,  Sabbath,  Guns N' Roses,  Kiss,  The Beatles.  I like a lot of bands.  I like a lot of Motown.  I like The Four Tops.  How many of those bands  are still together?  Most of them probably not.  Most of them probably not.  I like a lot of bands.  I like Elvis.  YV saying,  so Californication  isn't deep,  but Iron Man is?  I'm glad you read that already.  I was reading other ones  during that time. 
[02:40:00]  I've already dealt  with Your Vag,  that stupid YV.  Sorry.  I dealt with him.  All right.  And Iron Man  was pretty bright  because he was talking  about space travel  in like 1970.  Who else was doing that?  Wow,  what a pioneer.  But who else  was talking about that?  Who else was talking  about those dark sides  of human life?  Come on,  half man,  half dog?  What is he?  Who knows?  He sang China Girl.  David Bowie  should be beaten.  You guys are mean.  We've softened  on delivery,  my friend.  I don't have kids.  I want porno,  I want porno  on my TV.  I want violent video games.  I want violence on TV. 
[02:40:30]  I don't want to take it off  because you had kids.  All you people  and children  make the effort sick.  The Opie  and Anthony Show.  Where's I got it?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  The Opie  and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-t-t-t-t-t-a-w-n-e-w-n-e-w-n-e.  And it's time to play  whatever you learn  on The Opie  and Anthony Show today.  Sam,  what's going on?  Sammy?  Yeah?  What's going on, bro?  Uh, you want to hear an AR-15 go off? 
[02:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you want to fire some stuff?  Oh, yeah.  All right, hit it.  All right, hold on.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  All right, honey.  Very nice.  Brian, what's going on? 
[02:41:30]  I learned today that I have on the exact same taste in music as a, uh, sex addict.  Black Sabbath absolutely rules.  Thank you, man.  You're right.  You're welcome.  All right.  Hey, Chris, it's Theo.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Today I learned Ant-Straight just likes to make out with his guy friends once in a while.  For depressed women, more mule juice, more gooder.  And John Entwistle's last words were, I'm all right.  Hey, listen, guys. 
[02:42:00]  You've got to admit that live Sabbath was better than Zeppelin.  Of course I'm wise.  Plant always sucks.  Bye.  Hey, can I shoot off my nine for you guys?  No.  No?  No.  I don't think he's got one.  Jared.  We lost Jared.  All right.  Jared eats the sandwiches.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that when the O&A wanted to take a break, all you've got to do is say that somebody  is better than Sabbath.  Later.  That's funny.  Well, we got there.  John Entwistle had to die and got back into that conversation again. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, we were going to talk about Bananages for an hour.  Someone cut short.  Someone on instant feedback.  I'm sorry.  I can't find it now to give you credit.  Suggested that my brother Joe is now on the phone with Pete Townsend.  Yeah.  There's the bass gig.  Sheep lover learned.  Mad props to Carson Opie.  Mad props. 
[02:43:00]  Jerry from Edison.  The wife is getting a big batch of happiness tonight.  That's what he has learned.  Ah.  And he also learned the Third Reich was bigger than Sabbath.  He tired us out with that last rant, Jimmy.  It was not my intention either.  I did not want to do that today at all.  It's not my thing.  Speaking of the Third Reich, you were as passionate about Sabbath as Hitler was about the Reich.  Like, I could picture you up there just giving one of those impassioned speeches and just, 
[02:43:30]  like, inspiring people.  Well, when you are passionate about something, unfortunately, it's something as inane as Ozzy and Sabbath.  I don't know.  God forbid it's either a writing material or a film.  If you actually had that passion in your life or other things, you'd be whatever you want to be.  I am already.  Oh, you are?  I'm a comic?  Yeah.  A comic sex addict with AIDS?  I don't have AIDS.  I am working on it.  I am working on it.  Blind Dave.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey, Norton, you're making me embarrassed to be an Ozzy fan. 
[02:44:00]  Really?  Don't want to get chew on a urinal mint, you blind zilch.  Hey, listen, you little zero.  The only reason I don't like Zeppelin or The Who is because I've heard it to death.  Exactly.  That is one.  I agree with you.  I'm the same age as you.  Get with it, man.  Listen to something new.  And Wizzle heard it to death, too.  How do you know what you're listening to when he actually put it in, you non-CD cover reading?  Dude, I've seen Ozzy front row center stage when I could see.  No, you didn't, dummy.  They faced you backwards and they laughed at you.  He's got five albums selling you the same crap over and over. 
[02:44:30]  Really?  Crazy Train is the same as I Just Want You?  Randy Rhoads tribute.  Speak of the Devil live at last.  You know what Speak of the Devil was doing?  Speak of the Devil.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Wake up, Norton.  He's doing the same stuff.  No.  Speak of the Devil was released because they had a contract, I think a Jet Records,  where they wanted Ozzy, had to do a double live album, and they made him name it Speak  of the Devil, and he would not put Randy's name on anything with Devil in it.  Had they changed the title, Tribute would have come out years ago. 
[02:45:00]  Randy Rhoads was released on Speak of the Devil.  That was Brad Gillis, you idiot.  It was Brad Gillis.  Brad Gillis played on Sabbath's album, you dummy.  He played on Speak of the Devil.  It's all old Sabbath stuff, and they put it together in a week because he would not release  anything with Devil or Randy on it.  Friends of the Opioid Entry. </pre>
