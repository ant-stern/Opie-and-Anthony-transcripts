<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with self-promotional jingles and a Leslie Nielsen anecdote before transitioning into a discussion of the upcoming weekend, referencing a previous "It's Friday" clip.  Comedian Nick DiPaolo fills in for Jimmy Norton.  A substantial portion of the show details graphic and offensive stunts performed on a recurring homeless character, "Tippi Tom," including using his bodily fluids and soiled underwear for various grotesque pranks.  The hosts and crew experience significant physical reactions (vomiting and dry heaving). Photos and audio of these events are mentioned as being available online.  Tippi Tom's personal struggles with alcoholism, gambling, and homelessness are also briefly discussed.  Other topics include American Airlines flight cancellations and a Red Sox fan burying a Red Sox shirt under concrete at Yankee Stadium. The show features the "FU Line" segment with numerous angry and vulgar caller messages. Anthony mentions carrying a pistol at home due to concerns about home invasions.

Opie shares a humorous anecdote about scaring his wife.  The conversation moves to the dangers of driving with headphones and inattentive drivers, leading to a discussion of "Rickrolling" and its connection to a Mets game sing-along.  A listener segment focuses on past human stupidity regarding sports safety (lack of goalie masks, hockey net placement, etc.), car safety (lack of rear seatbelts), and other historical hazards (mercury in hats, x-ray machines in shoe stores, radium paint in watches, iron lungs).  Listeners detail various examples of past dangerous practices. Opie suggests a blood alcohol content-based driver's licensing system. Nick DiPaolo contributes anecdotes and commentary throughout this segment.

The show then discusses the hosts' renewed contract with CBS, contrasting the positive press release with overwhelmingly negative fan site reactions. One particularly critical commenter's life is satirized.  A caller, Jolene, recounts childhood asbestos and mercury exposure.  The hosts discuss the decline of message boards and take calls: Kevin inquires about thalidomide testing, and Rob shares family anecdotes about historical medical practices (trepanation, over-the-counter heroin).  A collect call from Michael, an inmate in Bayside State Prison, details his sentence for a fight after mistakenly entering his neighbor's home while intoxicated. He claims the homeowner started the fight and mentions a subsequent solitary confinement stint.  The hosts express skepticism. Nick DiPaolo offers commentary. Michael mentions attending a Skid Row concert (without Sebastian Bach) before his arrest. The show promotes a new Above Radio promo, contrasting it with a slow news story about "Yoga with Your Dog" classes.  Further discussion of Michael's prison experiences and a Tippi Tom incident involving defecation on the studio couch are included.  The segment ends with promotions for Nick DiPaolo's appearances and website.

A video of Tippi Tom's emotional reaction to *Sophie's Choice* prompts speculation. A graphic discussion of a mysterious skid mark on a chair follows.  The show includes a studio audience, featuring a couple from Cleveland (Sam and Sean), who are subjected to a sexually suggestive interview.  There is a negotiation involving Sean performing music in exchange for Sam removing clothing; this escalates into vulgar and sexually explicit propositions.  A call from Chris, a victim of a home invasion described by the inmate Michael, provides a contrasting account.  Further discussion of the new deal and comparisons to other radio personalities occurs, alongside attempts to organize Sean's musical performance, which is repeatedly delayed with sexually suggestive banter continuing with Sam.

The broadcast focuses on a female guest, "Erica from Cleveland," wearing tight jeans, and discussions about her resemblance to celebrities.  Erica's belly dancing prompts performances and comments focusing on her body.  Sean, her musician boyfriend, performs several songs. The hosts' interaction is heavily focused on sexually suggestive banter and increasingly explicit requests for Erica to remove clothing in exchange for more music.  Negotiations involve incentives including Erica removing clothing, simulated/real orgasms, and sex toys. Listener calls contribute to the chaotic and sexually charged atmosphere. Sean performs more songs, and the hosts promote his website and upcoming gig.

The show promotes Nick DiPaolo's comedy shows. The hosts engage in vulgar jokes and sexually suggestive banter, including a crude joke about Thomas Jefferson.  An upcoming weekend trip is discussed, with assurances of no flying. More sexually explicit jokes, including descriptions of a butt plug and sexual acts, follow.  Listener calls about an area code and a musician's record label (FTF Records) are included.  A self-aggrandizing skit portraying one host as a "black ninja" concludes the segment, incorporating crude humor and sexual innuendo.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Mox Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Intimous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk Show Radio Hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Let's welcome Leslie Nielsen to the Opie and Anthony Show.  All do you do?  We should play Drunk or Stroke.  Okay, so Opie and Anthony.  My first time sort of touching a woman.  I don't know what words were you used.  First time you picked a girl's nose, what happened?  Her parents come home, so we break it all up, 
[00:01:00]  and the dog runs over, and he's just licking, licking, licking my finger.  This is where entertainment is going.  You're Chris Hansen.  I am.  Have you seen the show?  I thought you were real funny on Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you listened to me on Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  That's a plug you don't really want.  Unbelievable.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, that's not good publicity. 
[00:01:30]  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  It's Friday.  So you say it like that, and everyone gets excited that the weekend's almost here.  It's Friday.  Then you almost feel compelled to say, thank God, but, yeah.  We used to have a really good Friday clip we used to play.  I don't know where it is, though.  Oh, that crazy guy?  Maybe we still have it somewhere.  The It's Friday guy?  It's Friday. 
[00:02:00]  He was very excited that it was Friday.  Yeah, he was a kook.  No?  I don't think we have it.  It's all right.  Oh, E-Rock.  I wouldn't worry.  Oh, E-Rock's got it.  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  Got that right.  Thank you.  And sitting in for a little Jimmy Norton, it's Nick DiPaolo, everyone.  Hi, everyone.  How are you? 
[00:02:30]  It's thrilled to be here.  He's freezing like we all are.  It's freezing here.  Except Anthony's not cold.  Why aren't you cold?  Well, because I have one of two choices.  To be a little cold, which it is, or to put my parka on and sweat all day.  Well, why are you wearing a parka?  It's spring.  I know.  It's one of those transitional periods.  I don't know what to wear.  No, it's time for the hoodies and stuff.  It's jacket day, I think.  That's obvious.  But it's like 15 degrees colder today than it was yesterday at this time. 
[00:03:00]  That's just it.  I can't tell.  And the building can't tell either because they just figured that we need A.C. today.  No, we don't need A.C. today.  They're exactly a day behind in how they pump air into this place.  Yesterday was 70 degrees, so a lot of air conditioning.  Today, the temperature jumped.  Eh, we'll keep the A.C. on.  So, well, we're trying to get it turned off because poor Nick is freezing over there.  I'm all right.  I'm used to it.  I was in that little studio when I was here.  Oh, you didn't even get to broadcast? 
[00:03:30]  Of course not.  From the big boy table?  From the big boy table?  I was there with the kids over there.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  For the people across America, Nick used to work for this fine radio station here in New York  before they went to another rock format.  Yeah.  Before you.  And, uh...  Well, they went to Molly Hatchet 24 hours a day.  And Nick was actually getting something done with his radio show, and he was collateral damage, unfortunately.  I mean, the show, you know, the station had a bunch of shows that no one's missing, but you were definitely... 
[00:04:00]  I was working on it.  You were definitely doing something.  You had a little buzz going.  Buzz going?  Hell yeah.  And it was growing, and then all of a sudden they kicked you out for 24 hours of Molly  Hatchet.  But you had to, like, broadcast from the closet down the hall?  That little room, and it was like an experiment, a Nazi experiment.  It would be 11 degrees and then 117.  And I spent, like, literally, I'd get in there a half hour to 40 minutes early, tape and cardboard  over the vents.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, sure.  Yeah, that's smart, actually.  Yeah, newspapers.  Yeah, yeah.  I used to put up newspaper with duct tape.  It would take, like, 45 minutes.  And then I'd come in the next day, and whoever was in after me tore it all down, and I'd have  to start over again.  This is a radio station.  It was like a beaver.  I had to rebuild a damn thing after somebody.  Yeah, you could see my breasts by the end of the show.  It was like a Packers game in the 50s.  No way to do radio, right?  But Nick is here, and we're very happy about that.  Thank you for having me, you guys.  Jimmy's doing two shows in the Detroit area. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know where.  I wasn't paying attention.  Go to eatabullet.com and check out where he's going to be this weekend.  That's the Mikey name of a place I've never heard of before.  Absolutely.  And now I got hiccups because of Nick.  Oh.  Thanks, Nick.  You sure it's not the dirty underwear sketch you're on?  Well.  That'll give you the hiccups.  Oh, God.  I guess we got to start by telling people that this show kind of goes in, what?  What?  Like, stages.  Like, it's...  How can I explain this?  No, it kind of runs the gamut between intellectual talk. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Occasionally.  We do delve into that.  Right.  Politics and whatnot with our own little twist into just some of the most disgusting, heinous,  unnecessary segments that I've ever heard or been party to.  We'll decide to go down a road, and then we go as far down that road as we can, and  then we finally get off that road.  Trust me.  And I think we finally went to the end of the road yesterday. 
[00:06:00]  There's nowhere to go.  We've been on this kick of just getting really, really gross and disgusting on this radio  show.  Yeah.  It has to be acknowledged.  And it came out of nowhere, started innocent enough with a thing here, a thing there, and  then Nick comes in and goes, dude, when you guys were doing that tongue scraping last  week with Big A, I had to actually turn off your radio show.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  And I don't know if that's what we're looking for when we do some of these bits, but it  makes us laugh.  It makes us laugh hysterically.  All like retards.  We sit here and just giggle our asses off. 
[00:06:30]  I'm not exactly a demographic.  You're trying to hit a 46-year-old miserable bastard.  Well, according to the papers today, we're number one, men 18 of 49, Nick, so you're  right in there.  Oh, no.  Yes.  How about that?  I'm a push.  How about that?  So, Big A, we scraped his tongue for the first time ever, and he has bad breath to  begin with.  He hasn't seen a dentist in a couple decades.  And bad breath barely covers it.  I mean, you're glazing over the whole thing.  He will have people, and I hate to do this to Big A, because I really like the guy, and  this is one thing that really bothers him, really bothers him. 
[00:07:00]  But maybe he'll finally do something about it.  I doubt it.  Although we said we would do something about it for him, but we haven't really done anything  about it yet.  But he's the type of guy that when he comes into a room, people across the room will  start kind of looking at him like, where's that smell from?  What happened?  Is there something in the...  Is there a dead rat in the wall?  Is there something...  Is there something in the drop ceiling?  Yeah, and it's Big A in the corner, just going about his life.  Squirrel in the chimney, maybe died.  Is that just his breath, or his whole body gives off? 
[00:07:30]  It's his breath.  It's so pungent that it takes over a whole room.  Yeah.  When he's in the room, we were doing that pilot for Comedy Central, and him and a bunch  of the other freaks had us sit in a room, and we would go in and choose from one of them,  walk in the room, and instantly, you open the door, and it would hit you in the face.  A wall of smell.  Yeah.  Maybe he's got, like, stomach cancer or something, no?  Well, he can only hope, because whatever else, it has to be worse than stomach cancer. 
[00:08:00]  He had a huge tumor removed from his neck, and he's doing okay with that.  Well, he's filled with the poop.  Speaking of that, we had him get the colonic thing, and the doctor said, I can't help you.  It's too, what, packed?  Too much blood.  Yeah, yeah.  He was impacted.  Impacted too much.  He was impacted, so they put that, you know, they put the hose up, I guess, that they used  to loosen everything up, and then, what's the word I'm looking for? 
[00:08:30]  Evacuate.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they said she couldn't get through the blockage.  It was like a sacrete.  She didn't know what to do with him, so he's definitely got some issues.  So we did that, and the video's up on YouTube, and people are getting grossed out across America,  because we all started dry heaving.  A few of us puked, because the scraping ended up in a spoon.  See, now I have to explain to you, because you turned off the show, and then we all took 
[00:09:00]  turns smelling it, because that's what...  Was somebody going to taste it or something?  Oh, well, we were thinking about that, but we weren't sure how safe that was.  It scraped off, and it looked like Wheatina.  Yeah.  That's what I pictured.  That's why I shut it off, like a white...  Just lumpy, white, cottage cheesy.  At one point, we scraped, and what can only be described as an oyster fell onto his shirt,  and we got really mad that we lost the sample.  We had to scrape it off his shirt. 
[00:09:30]  What the dude?  This is what grown men do, Nick.  And just when you think, like, that is disgusting.  Yeah.  It just took on a whole new level.  Well, yeah.  We've been going down this road for a while.  Then I did the baby diaper mustache with Rich Voss' kid's diaper.  That was...  That, you know...  Disgusting.  That was never supposed to happen, but it did.  And that video's up on YouTube.  I just get chills.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those kids.  And then yesterday...  It leads us to yesterday, and hopefully the end of this kick we've been on. 
[00:10:00]  But we had our buddy, Tippi Tom, in.  And...  Buddy?  I call him a buddy.  Absolutely.  Invite him over.  Why not?  You guys hang out on the weekend golfing.  I got a hole in what?  He's a buddy of the radio show.  Oh, that's true.  He knows us all.  He's equal, in my eyes, to Big A, Stalker Patty.  Wow.  Pat from Monarchy.  You don't discriminate.  And even Steven S. from Bayshore. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, I'm sure Steve is happy to hear.  They're on the level with me.  He's on the same level as Tippi Tom.  Although Steven S. from Bayshore is the only one I invite to actually sit at my table at  FH Riley's.  The rest of them, I say, scram!  Skedaddle.  So anyway, Tippi Tom was in, and I guess because we get bored, I don't know, we decided  to get really crazy with Tippi Tom yesterday.  And how do we explain this one?  It's a slow build with Tippi Tom, too. 
[00:11:00]  He came in, he was relatively sober, and then slowly, somehow he just gets more intoxicated.  And it happens, actually not slowly, pretty quickly.  Yeah.  And then we just try to figure out what can we do with a drunken, homeless guy.  Yeah.  And, uh...  I don't know, help him out?  Ah, perish that thought.  You know, I don't like to, we don't like to show that side of us, but we actually did  try to help the guy, and we actually got him sober.  Yeah, we tried to help him.  And he called us from a hospital where he was, like, drying out, and his voice was completely 
[00:11:30]  different.  He was, he had the voice of the gayest guy you could imagine.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because he's gay.  Maybe they're bloody guys.  Well, he's bisexual.  Yeah, but you can't tell when he's talking like this!  I like this!  Where's my beer?  Where's my beer?  But then when he was sober and he's in the hospital, we call over the tippy time, he's  like, yes, hi, yeah, guys, it's, I want to thank you so much for having me in the hospital.  Like, who the hell is that?  Put Tippy Tom on the phone!  Do we have that audio?  What the hell is this? 
[00:12:00]  E-Rock, we ever find that audio?  We gotta find that.  That's what we, look, and there he is without his, without his beard.  I know this is radio, but...  Ah, E-Rock broke the camera.  Ha ha ha.  Look, this is, look, that's the same guy.  That doesn't even resemble.  No, actually, can you put that, can you put that up on onaradio.com, that picture and  the picture from yesterday?  It looks good there.  Yeah, do a screen cap, as Stephen S. from Bayshore will explain, whatever, this is, here's  a picture we're looking at of Tippy Tom in a hospital bed, without his beard, showered,  on the phone, big smile, good looking guy, actually, when you clean him up. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, he should be talking to his friend to take care of his little poodle while he's  away at a hospice.  Right.  And, but see, that wasn't good enough for us, because when we did, like, clean him up  a little bit, that's what we did for him.  Oh, we brought him in, yeah, we brought him in a male stripper into the hospital room.  Oh, that's kind of against the regulations.  That stripper looks like a Nazi.  It looks like that guy that fought Indiana Jones on the plane. 
[00:13:00]  And definitely, your friend Tippy Tom is definitely gay, because look at that, he couldn't be  happier.  Yeah, look at that.  He is really happy.  He's on the phone, because he's talking to us live on the air, while this male stripper  gives him a little lap dance in his hospital bed, as we're trying to clean him up.  We're just, we're just not good people.  So get that picture up on onaradio.com as well.  So anyway, Tippy Tom went back to drinking, obviously, and it's, oh, now he's worse than 
[00:13:30]  ever.  And his legs are all blown up with, it looks like gangrene.  It just looks like gangrene.  Is it goat or something?  His legs, like, black and has elephant skin, and they're so swollen that his jeans look like  they're ready to rip.  Yeah.  Sounds like you're describing Oprah's legs.  Let's say hi to Terry Montana.  The phone's really lit.  They want to talk about this today.  Terry, what's up?  Yellow time, Terry.  All right.  That was good. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you.  He was speechless.  How to get the day rolling.  So then we get the idea that we need to cut Tippy Tom's underpants off from yesterday.  Yeah, Tippy Tom's underwear has been, we've been fixated on them for years, because they're  amongst the most toxic things you'll ever see.  So, and yesterday had to be the worst pair ever.  Ever.  It's the same pair, just getting worse.  Oh, you think it is?  He doesn't change underwear worse.  I don't think we've ever taken them before. 
[00:14:30]  It probably has, for five years.  And as we continue with the story, it's obvious that he didn't change his underwear.  Yeah.  Okay.  They had to be cut off of him, because he can't really get his pants down over his swollen  legs.  Oh, yeah, I saw that.  So he pulls him down.  E-Rock with surgical gloves, gagging the whole time.  He was able to cut right at the hip line and get the underwear off.  Once they were cut, though, and we pulled the underwear out, you were able to see what was going 
[00:15:00]  on in there.  Well, that was after half of us started dry heaving.  The horror.  And E-Rock started puking again.  At one point yesterday, what did Jimmy ask you, E-Rock?  That should have been line of the day.  He goes, why are your eyes all black and blue?  I was like, I've been throwing up for the last three hours.  Yeah.  His eyes get all black and blue.  He breaks blood vessels in his eyes.  E-Rock, yeah, he was puking, yeah, for three hours, because we did stuff over here that made  him puke as well, but whatever. 
[00:15:30]  All I could say, to give you an image in your mind that's probably the most accurate, is  did you ever see one of those dried up drinking holes in the Serengeti?  It just, yeah, it's kind of like, it takes on this pattern of cracking, yet it's still  kind of wettish.  That's what it looked like.  Did somebody hit it with a hammer?  Well, what happened was, we spread it out on a table, and like, you saw the video already, 
[00:16:00]  Nick, and Nick's like, this looks like an episode of CSI or something.  So we spread it out, which made us start puking and dry heaving again.  There was not, like Anthony pretty much said, but there was not a hint of moisture in this  mess.  It's like King Tut, you know, when they pick them up.  Open the shroud.  Let's just put it this way, E-Rock was trying to get it all, like, opened up, and he goes, 
[00:16:30]  I think I just saw an ant.  Yeah.  An ant in this mess.  And it was petrified in a block of it, where you could then suck out the DNA and make a  dinosaur.  Right.  It's like he had resin.  So.  And amber.  So then, uh.  Oh, my God.  So then we, we decided, uh, you know, because the baby diaper mustache was such a success  that we needed to do, uh, Tippi Tom's.  Homeless underwear. 
[00:17:00]  Mustache.  Mustache.  Yeah.  And, and who the hell would do this, first of all?  Right.  Who, who in the hell do we know that would actually do something like this?  Is it right?  Tippi Tom's mom?  No.  He's sitting right there, Pat F. and Duffy.  Pat F. and Duffy.  Came with a Taliban beard?  Yeah.  He's got a Taliban.  He's got a Taliban beard, but, and it's missing the mustache.  So this is perfect.  We needed to give him a mustache.  So.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  There you go.  Look, we're looking at a picture now of a dried lake bed.  That is exactly what it looked like.  Yeah.  Actually, I, actually, I could play something for you.  Speaking of the dried, uh, the dried, uh, lake bed.  Play that clip, uh, E-Rock.  The first one.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  Listen to this.  I can't.  That was in his underpants.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, what is that?  Jesus.  There was a chip to the gambling table.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:00]  You can hear it.  You can hear it.  It was a rock.  We found what could only be described as a rock.  A rock.  Yeah, we were dropping it.  We.  I say we.  I would never get near any of this.  I was never closer than probably 20 feet from that.  So when I say we, I mean the show.  But, uh, who was actually picking it up and dropping it?  Was it, uh, Pat F and Duffy?  Pat F and Duffy.  Picking it up, holding it about two feet above the table, dropping it.  And you heard the same sound as if you took a rock and dropped it on a table. 
[00:18:30]  Dropped a school book.  Yeah.  It was horrid.  It was a fossil.  It was a fossil, basically.  He did that without gloves, too.  And it.  Oh.  What?  The, the, the underwear, it just was amazing.  What?  It's, I, I can't even imagine.  Were they at some point, tighty whiteys?  Oh, yeah.  They were just white, fruit of the loom type underwear.  They should use, this would be a great ad.  You know that Billy Mays, that guy comes on late at night?  With his oxy clean?  Yeah, his oxy stuff.  Yeah, let's. 
[00:19:00]  Try to make those white.  Look, I give up.  That would end.  Hey, Kevin, Kevin in Philly's got a great observation.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Good.  The show is great, just the diversity of the show.  Earlier in the weekend, Dr. Kaku on, and yesterday you had Dr. Kaka on.  Yeah, we go from talking physics with one of the premier, the great minds of the world,  in the world, to, hey, Pat, F., and Duffy, rub this under your nose. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Will do.  Will do.  Scott in Iowa, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Love you.  Love the show.  Yeah.  I was going to say about that Duffy and the incident they did, I want that as a ringtone,  his blech sound.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, the dry heaving.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Just amazing.  Thank you, Scott.  All right, let's say hi to David in Texas.  David.  Hey, man, I was just going to say, yesterday when Tippi was by himself on the air, there 
[00:20:00]  at the first, he was saying some pretty profound things about how he didn't care, that people  didn't care about him.  Yeah.  It was really odd.  He's a very intelligent guy.  I mean, it's just.  He's very intelligent.  For the three seconds he's sober.  Yeah, it's just that the alcohol got in the way somewhere in his life, and all that  in the, I don't think he's confused about his sexuality.  I'm just going on.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  Could be.  I'm judging it on that picture I just looked at.  Yeah.  Right, right.  And the stripper.  He's pretty confused. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, he looked pretty happy.  And then the gambling, I think, was a big problem.  That came out yesterday.  He was in Reno.  He lived in Reno.  For many years.  Oh, that'll make you nuts.  And yeah.  And he got a gambling problem.  He used to own a business, a glass cleaning and tile cleaning business.  He had a wife, kids, and I don't know.  He went up, started betting, and it was over.  And then you end up there.  Like, you have a successful business.  You never think you're going to be tippy top.  You said he had a wife and kids? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  He gave up.  He was married.  He's divorced.  A lot of internal conflict going on.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He talked about that yesterday a little bit.  He said he got a divorce because he didn't want his son to know that his father's a little  flaky.  He said this.  And his son's about 13, and he just left his wife and kids.  He's like, I don't know if he's fruited either.  He might be a fruit, too.  So he's got a gambling problem, too, we learned yesterday.  So we decided to do a little blackjack as well. 
[00:21:30]  We had beers and money for him.  Two things that a homeless guy could really use.  And he really loves beer and does not like seeing it wasted.  He'd rather drink it.  He got that way.  His underwear got like that from drinking beer?  I think so.  Whiskey and hard liquor?  Yeah, pretty much beer.  Oh, my God.  Did you see him drink?  It's obvious that, oh, man, I wish I could describe the underwear better, but there was  a lot of things going on in this pair.  It was just multicolored.  Jurassic taint.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  It was a very diverse underwear.  Let's just put it this way.  The thickness of the underwear was at least 20 to 30 times thicker than a normal pair of underwear.  Yeah, yeah.  It was built up with a...  He insulates himself.  Oh, my God.  I saw the clip.  It looked like a catcher's mitt.  Yeah.  I am.  Perfect.  That's a great way to look at it.  A 30-year-old catcher's mitt that somebody had oiled every spring.  So, we decided to do a little Blackjack Anthony versus Tippy Tom.  The game was really simple. 
[00:22:30]  Six beers on the table and $10 a hand.  Ten bucks a hand.  Tippy Tom wins.  He gets $10 and a beer.  Tippy Tom loses.  He doesn't get the $10, and we pour one of the beers out right in front of him.  Into a bucket.  Into a bucket.  And he's looking at the first one when he lost.  It's going, oh!  It's gold to him.  You're throwing gold ingots.  That even bothers me.  And I'm not an alcoholic.  So...  Ain't waste.  I was great that way.  Let it be known that Tippy Tom beat Anthony four... 
[00:23:00]  He won four out of the six hands of...  He did, yeah.  He got on a little streak, the best.  Of Blackjack.  So, then he's got $40 in his pocket, which is huge for a homeless guy.  And he's got four beers.  We go, Tippy Tom, we got a deal for you.  Oh, my God.  One hand, double or nothing.  More than double or nothing.  I put up $100 in his $40.  Anthony threw another $100 in.  So, I go, it's $100 if you win.  You keep the $40.  So, it's $140 total if you win.  If you lose, you get nothing.  No beer, no money, nothing. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, no.  Please don't tell me.  Well, you know, the guy couldn't have done any better.  He pulled a $20.  He pulled a $20.  He hit on $14 and got a $6.  He hit a $14.  He got a $6.  I was devastated because I was showing a queen.  I thought at least a push until I pulled over my ace and blackjacked him.  No, you didn't.  Oh, of course.  No, you didn't.  Why wouldn't I when Danny rigged the cards?  We rigged the cards.  Taking all his money away from him.  That's my money.  He's like, I'm going to stay right where I am. 
[00:24:00]  He's all cocky.  I'm winning this one.  You give me my money.  I'm like, oh, Tom.  And I flipped the ace over and he started crying again.  It was like his fifth time crying.  And then we had to take all the beers away from him and just dump him in the bucket in  front of him.  And his money.  People probably been doing stuff like that to him since first grade.  Oh, yeah.  He's all screwed up, you know?  Yeah.  All right.  So here's where we're at.  We got to take our first break.  When we get back, we got the audio of Pat effing Duffy doing the mustache with what was in 
[00:24:30]  Tippi Tom's underwear.  All I know is, please excuse me for the beeps, because I cursed probably five times in a  row out of complete and sheer disbelief.  Yeah.  And also, we'll tell you where the video is at.  It's up on YouTube, but I'm not sure what the search is yet.  It's going to be in the American Journal of Medicine for some kind of hepatitis.  A new one.  Hepatitis M.  Pat Duffy's going to call it the Duffy Titus. 
[00:25:00]  No fever or anything, Duff?  No.  All right?  Nothing?  No fever?  I think I ought to send you to Africa to help people.  He looks good.  You're impervious.  He's healthy looking.  The only thing that happened yesterday was the whole day I kept thinking that I kept smelling  Tippi Tom really randomly.  I had to think that I'd smell it, but it was probably just psychological.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  I think it is psychological.  Very nice.  All right.  So, yeah.  Right after the break, we'll play the audio of Pat Duffy doing the mustache thing.  It's one of the greatest sounds I've ever heard on this radio show anyway. 
[00:25:30]  The dry heaving is great.  It's one of the greatest sounds ever heard on this show.  I will say that again.  Nick DiPaolo sitting in for Jim Norton, and we'll take more of your phone calls at 877-212-ON-A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony on your radio doll.  Radio doll.  We got Nick DiPaolo in the studio.  Make sure you check out his website, nickdip.com.  We were just admiring his fine website here.  Yeah, that's good.  All his tour dates are up there. 
[00:26:00]  He does a video blog.  And you want to push what, next weekend?  Next weekend, a brand new club opening, Comedy Club in Haskell, New Jersey.  It's called the Comedy Shop at 815.  That's the name of the club.  Comedy Shop at 815.  815, but I'm going to be there Friday and Saturday night, and I got a door deal, so please show up.  It's a big, and it's a grand opening.  Don't make me look bad, please.  Yeah, come on.  That's very, very cool.  The Comedy Shop at 815 is the name of the club, but you're going to be doing, what, a 730 and 10 o'clock show or something? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, that's the thing.  Oh, no, people are going to show up at 815.  Everyone's going to show up.  That's a dumb name.  Dumb name.  Dumb name.  Someone has to say it.  Change it immediately before you open the doors.  But, yeah, so the improv, somebody pulled a date on me at the last second, and they wanted me to go to, I was supposed to be in Hartford at the Funny Bone, and I was like, it's like a good club, but I haven't done it yet.  All my friends have done it and stuff, so I finally get a date.  Then they yank it at the last second. 
[00:27:00]  They want to put Charlie Murphy in there and send me to Omaha, and I went, no.  What?  No.  No.  So I just picked the phone up.  I know this guy in New Jersey, and I'm like, you got a new club that's ready to open.  You want to move the date up a few weeks?  He goes, yeah, sure.  Oh, right on.  Look at you wheeling and dealing.  Anything to stay out of Omaha.  Exactly.  Well, not that there's anything wrong with Omaha, but I'm just, uh.  We're not on in Omaha.  There's a lot wrong with it.  Okay, well, there you go.  If we were broadcasting to Omaha, then, man.  I just don't want to get on a plane any time, you know what I mean?  Well, any time I can avoid an airport. 
[00:27:30]  Well, they canceled another, what, 900 flights yesterday.  Yeah.  And then 500 and something today.  Really?  Yeah, the number's going down, but they said they should have the wiring all done by Saturday.  Well, if you weren't listening or haven't heard, yeah, there's wires in what, the wheel well?  Yeah.  Around the wheel well, and one of these wires could short circuit and blow up your plane.  Yeah, so I don't really have a problem with it, you know?  Yeah, sticking close to home.  You're on a plane, and they go, oh, you know, we have a little bit of delay. 
[00:28:00]  There's something wrong with the engine number two, and everybody in the plane's like, come on, let's go!  Yeah.  Yeah, let's take off with that screw missing in engine number three so I can end up in Omaha, burnt to a crisp in a cornfield.  You chooch.  Cartwheeling.  Take your time.  The headline today, by the way, with this whole mess, fly now and check it later, question mark.  American Airlines begged the feds yesterday to let it keep its fleet aloft, saying the fastenings that need to be checked pose no safety threat.  The answer was no. 
[00:28:30]  No.  No.  Well, if they did and something happened, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, would they just lay into the FAA?  You'd see him in Judge Judy next Wednesday.  John Jersey's going to explain why the Comedy Shop 815 is named Comedy Shop.  Well, I know why, because it's at 815, whatever the road is.  Oh, is John going to explain?  Yeah, John.  Isn't it?  John?  Yeah.  John.  John, why is the 815 added onto the name? 
[00:29:00]  That's the address on Ringwood Ave.  Oh, see, it's the address.  But see, no one's going to know that.  They're going to think that every show is at 815.  You know, I realized it was the address in two seconds.  Well, what else would it be?  What else would it be?  Remember gallons of water in the, you know, the sub pump system out of the building?  Yes, we know.  Thanks for climbing that up.  And it's at 815, so you know.  Maybe if your address was 422 or, I don't know, 119. 
[00:29:30]  But 815 is like, everything starts at 815.  It's a special comedy club.  So then when you say 815, and then you've got to give when the show time is, people are confused.  Where are you going tonight?  The 815 and see you at 730.  Yeah, exactly.  Take me up at 6.  Huh?  Right.  Second base.  Yeah, second show.  What?  I'm going to have, I'm going to have.  You said 815.  No, it's at 9 o'clock, and then there's 11 people there, and I get blamed for it.  Because everybody's late.  Terry from Montana decided to call back.  Terry, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boy?  Sorry, I was going over a mountain pass and got dropped. 
[00:30:00]  Mountain pass?  A mountain?  What?  What are you on, a donkey?  This country's huge.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's like, where?  This really is huge.  Where the hell do we broadcast, Dale?  I lost it because I was going over a mountain.  You know, you don't realize.  It's probably been a lot when you're talking about.  Terry, what is it?  I was listening to the replay this morning before you guys came on live and driving on  the interstate.  I actually had to pull over into the emergency parking-only lane and puke my guts up. 
[00:30:30]  Well, we'd like to do that to our listeners.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're welcome.  NickDip.com, baby.  Yeah, there you go.  You got a call.  All right, listen.  So we left you hanging there.  We got the Pat F. and Duffy audio here.  So now we got to do the setup again, but the quick setup.  We had Tippi Tom in yesterday, our homeless friend.  We cut his underwear off him.  Obviously, he's been wearing the same pair of underwear for, I would say, years.  Years.  Not weeks, not months, years. 
[00:31:00]  And that's not an exaggeration.  I saw that.  Right, right.  That is not an exaggeration.  Literally years.  Years.  We cut it off him.  We spread it out on a table.  It looked like a dry...  Dry lake bed.  Lake bed.  It looked like Jane Woods' skin.  Yeah, there was petrified stuff in there because we lifted it up and dropped it on the table  and it sounded like you were dropping a rock.  Yeah.  And we wanted Pat Duffy to do a mustache with what was found in this pair. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Unfortunately, it was not a hint of moisture in there, so we had to kind of like pour water  over it.  Had to activate it.  We had to activate it.  It was like sea monkeys.  Yeah, it was...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was that dry.  We had to reactivate it with some water.  Nestle's quick.  Yeah.  Right.  So with that said...  One of those beef bouillon cubes.  Yeah.  That's what it was like.  It's a tea bag.  Put it in some boiling water. 
[00:32:00]  Let it steep.  Yeah, we had to let it steep.  That's very funny.  That's not an omelet, by the way.  No.  And we pick up the audio with Pat Duffy getting ready to do the mustache.  Now, remember, he's taking his fingers, he's getting in there nice, and then he's making  a mustache.  Making a mustache.  For that Taliban beard of his.  With homeless guy.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's the audio from yesterday, finally.  Here's Pat Duffy.  Hi. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You have nothing on your face, though.  Make a mustache, you.  You gotta make a mustache.  I want my mustache.  Oh, no way.  No way.  Oh, no way.  Oh, no way.  Oh, no way.  Oh, no way.  Oh, no way.  Oh, no way.  Oh, no way. 
[00:33:00]  We're above radio.  Can I get hired for this?  Try heaming.  Yeah, he still doesn't get paid.  Oh, my God.  Try heaming.  He's going to put his fingers to the floor. 
[00:33:30]  I can't win this guy.  Wow.  And there you have it from yesterday's show.  Wow.  I don't think we could go any further than what we did yesterday.  Who the hell wrote that?  That I was laughing like I was at Abu Ghraib.  I would have laughed there, too. 
[00:34:00]  That's worse than waterboarding.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Stuff you went through.  Of course.  You couldn't do that to a prisoner.  No.  You'd be locked up.  We'd do it here for fun with our interns.  Amazing.  The video is just terrific.  And, you know, I'm waiting for them to tell me how we could tell the people how to get  to the video.  We should have had this ahead of time.  Yeah.  I don't know what it's going to take to get everyone on the same page with this freaking  radio show.  It's on YouTube.  What's the search for the bit we just played? 
[00:34:30]  Please.  Please tell me.  Askcheese.net.  Sam, what's the search?  Homeless underwear mustache.  Homeless underwear mustache.  There you go.  Okay.  All right.  You'll get to the video by popping in homeless underwear mustache on YouTube.  Our cinematographer here.  Yes.  And if it's not in the search engine for whatever reason, just go to YouTube.com slash E-Rock  Fan.  E-Rock Fan.  Ooh.  All right.  I'll pick that name. 
[00:35:00]  I did.  Oh.  I'm a big fan.  Because it's so obscure.  And you had a tough time shooting that yesterday, right?  Oh, yeah.  I've been able to shoot almost everything without getting involved at all.  That one, I almost puked.  I probably came closer to Pat Duff.  It's like a war correspondent.  You know, I've been able to shoot a lot of stuff, but when I was in Bosnia and saw children  that had stepped on landmines.  I've seen a lot of things.  I've seen a lot of things.  Listen to them.  Don't look at the camera.  Don't look at the camera.  Just walk by. 
[00:35:30]  I was embedded with the homeless people.  Oh, God.  There's a picture of the back of his underwear.  Oh, my aches.  Oh, God.  No.  Oh.  Sorry, man.  Got an ass like a baboon.  They decided to play the video, and I think we're finally done with this stuff.  I have a feeling.  Do you?  No way.  You should turn this into a feature movie.  I think we're done for a while anyway.  I think we're going to go down another road because.  Yeah.  Because the old dirt road's about done. 
[00:36:00]  This has run its course.  Poor Iraq is, you know, dry heaving and puking too much at this point.  Too much.  Too much dry heaving.  Too much puking on this radio show.  Blowing blood vessels in his eyeballs.  Yeah.  All right.  It's really one of the best things I've ever seen, though.  I've got to be honest.  You like it?  Oh, what was that that just fell out?  No, that's the thing.  That we're dropping on the table.  Oh, it's petrified.  Oh, my God.  It made a sound.  You look like you're doing a coin toss. 
[00:36:30]  Now, how is this guy not dead, man?  I don't know.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Somebody introduce him to baby wipes.  Baby wipes?  How about.  With Kingsford.  How about a sander?  He's a sander at this point.  Jesus.  Look at that.  We're spreading out the underwear.  Oh, my God.  There's blood and stuff in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That looks like some kind of worse than CSI.  That's like one of those A&E channel detective shows. 
[00:37:00]  Real life.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  And there's the slamming of the petrified rock onto the table.  But it's not a petrified rock.  It's probably part of his lower intestines.  Looks like somebody spilled a smoothie in a diaper.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, the video's up.  Sam, what is it again?  It's homeless underwear mustache.  And the YouTube username is Iraqfan.  Iraqfan.  Okay.  Thank God for the internet, huh, kids? 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Before the internet, you couldn't see anything like this.  No.  You just had to take our word for it that it was disgusting and gross.  You Google.  Sorry.  Pat dry heaving is so funny to watch.  Anyone dry heaving.  He's looking.  He's really, I mean, he's retching.  Snapping.  Yeah.  He's getting whiplash.  He's taking the...  All right.  We got to...  We're so distracted by this video.  Well, his stomach must have been empty, huh, Duff? 
[00:38:00]  Nothing in there?  You should have loaded up.  Yes.  Nice.  He really...  Creamed corn.  Look at his cup of beef stew and two smoothies and a hot dog and a quarter beer.  Let her fly.  Yeah, with a jack right off your feet.  That's the same guy, huh?  Wow.  Yeah.  He looked better in the hospital.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to move on for now, but...  Pat F and Duffy, everyone.  Yeah.  That's a hell of an effort.  Doing it again.  Once again, I say, Eastside Dave who? 
[00:38:30]  You're at the top of the pyramid now, my friend.  That's right.  Holla!  Holla!  You're like a Navy SEAL.  Holla!  Yeah.  That's what they put Navy SEALs through, tests like that.  Yeah.  Sniff this homeless guy's ass.  That knocks out like half of the Navy SEALs right there.  Yeah.  It's just fraternity stuff, you know.  We're just bringing fraternity stuff to the radio.  Hey, a lot of controversy going on, as you know by now.  We've talked about it a few times.  We got the Yankees building a new stadium, the Mets building a new stadium, and now there's 
[00:39:00]  some controversy with Yankee Stadium.  Uh-oh, what's the problem?  For everybody listening on BCN.  Listen closely.  Well, here's a question for you.  Is the new Yankee Stadium cursed?  Well, according to the New York Post, a diehard Red Sox fan working on the $1.3 billion ballpark  buried a Bo Sox t-shirt under a concrete slab in the visitor's clubhouse.  Two fellow construction workers told the paper they witnessed the dirty deed last August.  Well, now Yankee fans fear the new stadium is jinxed. 
[00:39:30]  I don't know if I'm going for that.  Oh, I'm not going for that.  I think it's one of those.  You know what?  When you're what many view as the best team in baseball, you can play little games like  that, but it doesn't work for you.  Any kind of Boston Red Sox, it wouldn't matter.  Best team in baseball?  Yeah, did they win it last year?  Yeah, I don't think they're the best team in baseball.  I'm sorry.  You dumb bitch.  I think to...  As a franchise, they've done quite well.  I'll give them that much.  I'm a Mets fan, by the way, Nick.  You're a Red Sox fan, right?  Yeah.  But best team in baseball, far from that. 
[00:40:00]  When's the last time they won it at this point?  Yeah, 2000.  What?  2000?  2000?  I think so.  That's seven, eight years ago.  Yeah.  I think in retaliation, we go to Fenway and bury Tippy Tom's underwear somewhere behind  the green monster.  Under home plate.  Yeah, and that'll jinx the hell out of it.  You can see Kevin Euclid dry heaving at Berkeley.  Yeah, they'll all be dry heaving and not knowing why.  And there's a base hit to write...  Our stupid paper's down here. 
[00:40:30]  That's the front page of the New York Post.  I know.  The world is falling apart.  I know.  We got foreclosures.  We got gas going up to, what, $4 a gallon by summer easily.  We got over 4,000 dead in Iraq.  That's what I said.  We got planes that could be exploding as we speak.  Anthony, if you're living in the Middle East, you know, you get on a bus, the odds of blowing  up like, you know, even money.  Yeah.  Imagine they're looking at the New York paper going, what? 
[00:41:00]  Somebody buried a t-shirt.  I don't know why they hate us.  I just buried my kids.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Right, right.  Post says, curses.  And they have the Red Sox shirt.  They got the Yankees logo.  And it says, buried shirt, put Sox pox on a new stadium.  There's also a story out that he playfully loosened some beams.  I think this is BS, by the way.  I can stop.  You think?  Well, you can't.  First of all, you can't hex a team with that kind of payroll. 
[00:41:30]  You know what I mean?  It might work for a year or two.  Right, right, right.  I see the Yankees are going to get back.  You know what I mean?  Come on.  Trillions of dollars.  You can't put a hex in a team like that.  Burying in a t-shirt.  But it's a big story.  They buried a t-shirt.  It's on the front page of the New York Post today.  Now, if the guy buried Phil Rizzuto, that would be a real hex, you know?  He's hiding his body.  Everybody thought he was dead.  I might buy into that, but a t-shirt's not going to do it.  Curses! 
[00:42:00]  Yes, curses indeed.  I bet somebody digs it up.  Yeah?  I bet somebody takes a jackhammer to the cement, digs it up.  What if it's like...  And then they'll show him standing there with his Yankee hat on.  I gotta get it out!  Curses!  Jackass!  It'll be that black guy that saved the guy on the subway.  You're that idiot.  Autry.  He'll be in the paper for the next ten years.  What part of the stadium is it buried?  They said under the visitor's...  Visitor's clubhouse.  Clubhouse?  Oh, really?  Yeah, they'll be taking a jackhammer to that. 
[00:42:30]  So the guy wasn't even brave enough to do it in the Yankee clubhouse?  I don't know.  If you're going to do this, you've got to go all out.  I think it...  He's going to jinx the visitors.  We'll see when the Reds...  Exactly!  That's what's going to happen.  Yankees win every game.  Every home game at this new stadium.  No, but if you're a Sox, when you come to Yankee Stadium, you're in that clubhouse.  That's kind of your good luck chart.  Ah, you know that that t-shirt's buried somewhere.  You think that's what his logic was in this whole thing?  I think it wasn't brave enough to go that distance.  What about the entire team's worth of jerseys that they're wearing during the game? 
[00:43:00]  Exactly.  That's a lame-ass story.  Absolutely.  All right, we're heading toward another break.  It's FU Friday.  Let's go to the FU line and see what's going on today.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have nine new voice messages.  First voice message.  Yeah, I just want to leave a big FU for my boss, Pat.

Okay, f*** all of you for the tongue scraping fit.  I just puked in my f***ing car.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line, 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[00:45:00]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Moving right along with the Opie and Anthony show.  I was thinking out loud during the break that maybe we should play me and my guitar today,  and I heard nothing but, no!  The idea was shut down.  They're like, no!  Well, it's kind of a slow news day, so I'm thinking maybe we play a little me and my guitar again today.  Slow news day? 
[00:45:30]  What are you talking about?  Michael Johns lost an American Idol last night.  Wow.  I actually saw that, and I'm not even watching American Idol this year.  I could care less.  I just heard it on 1010Wins on the way in.  He cost me five grand.  He said he hadn't even been in the bottom three the entire time.  Right.  And out of nowhere, I guess the judges didn't like his last performance.  Really?  And, yeah, it was enough where the public used their influence and voted him off.  It's really too bad that he's off American Idol because... 
[00:46:00]  I was an American Idol fan since the beginning.  Right.  And this is the first season I have not watched one episode.  Could care less.  That's because you're buying guns and shooting them and stuff.  Very busy with my guns.  Squirrels at .45.  Very busy with my guns.  You know what a .45 will do to a squirrel?  A squirrel's beaver.  Oh, right. 
[00:46:30]  Did you say that?  That was well put.  That was very nice.  I was listening to the replay of the Home Invasion talk yesterday,  and it just reinforced my whole thoughts on being an armed citizen.  Yeah.  Home invasions.  Very frightening thing.  You just don't want to be one of those guys.  You got guns, Nick?  I'm not going to say.  You can find out.  Come to my house.  Good idea.  Oh, you're one of those guys.  Anthony now carries a pistol as he walks around his house, though.  Well, why wouldn't you?  He didn't think he was safe enough with an alarm system,  with an NYPD cop that's pretty much living with him full time. 
[00:47:00]  Living there.  Living with mastic?  Surely.  And he also has guns throughout the house already.  He got rifles.  All those things he felt, you know, I could even be safer.  So now he carries a gun as he's walking around.  Exactly.  I could be safer.  There was a home invasion yesterday, I believe,  or the day before in Westbury, right there in Nassau County on Long Island.  And some girl answers the door.  Somebody's like, you know, delivery, whatever, whatever delivery service. 
[00:47:30]  She opens the door.  Because, you know, you do that, too.  We're so trusting.  Someone goes, oh, delivery, and you open the door.  And then two guys that were on either side of the door come barging in.  What color?  Grab her.  I was in Westbury.  I don't know, Nick.  I'm going to have to do more research on that.  I'm guessing Native American and Asian.  Yes.  They get in.  They tie her up.  Good for her.  You know, they were there for money and not maybe sexual favors. 
[00:48:00]  Was she fat?  Could be.  We kind of said that yesterday.  Very good.  But you know something?  When you answer the door and you're armed, what are they going to do?  I picture Anthony like that guy in Boogie Nights.  He's in his bathrobe.  Right, right, right.  Firecrackers are going off and he's got a gun in his underwear.  He's laughing like a maniac.  Everybody brings that guy up when they think about me.  Well, you're heading there.  You're definitely heading there.  Heading there.  Got a bit of paranoia in that brain of yours these days. 
[00:48:30]  Not so much paranoid.  I'm a realist.  You used to live in horrific neighborhoods.  You didn't have a gun.  Nothing ever happened to you.  Made it through.  Got lucky.  Made it through.  Who wanted to rob me when I was living in Greenlawn?  Look.  In some crap hole sharing a place with four other people.  CBS?  Yeah.  As much as I make fun, I was with you until it got to the stage where you're now carrying 
[00:49:00]  a gun as you walk around your own place.  It's comfy.  It's convenient.  Is that for the radio or are you really doing that?  No.  I like just having...  It's my own house.  I'm inside.  I'm not brandishing or anything like that.  I'm just inside my house.  You're an American doing an American thing.  Exactly.  Yeah, but he's got guns already.  Yeah, but...  And there are places where you can get to them quite quickly.  You ever see...  All of a sudden that alarm goes off, he can get to a gun within seconds.  I took the tour of his place.  There's guns everywhere.  I want to see it. 
[00:49:30]  So to go from that to now having a pistol on him at all times in his house, it's a little  weird in my eyes.  A little weird.  But it's like you said, the door.  When someone comes to the door and you open that door up, you're very vulnerable.  The alarm doesn't help.  First of all, no one's ringing your doorbell.  The neighbors gave up on you a long time ago.  Your friends gave up on you a long time ago.  Your family pretty much is disowning you.  So who the hell's coming to your door?  My family loves me.  So at this point, you know if someone's ringing your doorbell, it can't be good.  Because all the people that would love to ring your doorbell don't go there anymore. 
[00:50:00]  So you're advocating I just shoot through the door the next time the bell rings?  You're not the type of guy...  You're so paranoid.  You're not the type of guy that bell goes off and you're like, oh, I wonder who it is  and opens the door immediately.  You're going through all sorts of precautions to begin with.  No, I'm very...  Yeah, I'm kind of cautious.  But what do you do?  You have to open the door.  You can't just sit there and go through the door.  What?  Who is it?  Why do you have to...  Show me your credentials. 
[00:50:30]  Why do you have to open the door?  Because it's a delivery.  So tell them to leave it on the stoop and beat it.  And back off 10 feet.  Put your hands in the air.  Just write a note on your front door.  Drop the delivery and beat it.  And run.  Right.  Run for your goddamn life.  My wife's very naive like that, you know?  Yeah.  She's like out in the...  Again, we're up in the woods.  But believe it or not, and the Taconic's right behind us.  One day she gets up and there's a guy walking through our yard, like a 60-year-old black  guy. 
[00:51:00]  And I'm up in the woods.  Yeah.  And my wife, can I help?  I need water for my car.  No, you don't.  Oh, can I help you?  But my wife is like, she'll be out there gardening with her headphones on, iPod.  Oh, people just sneak right up on you.  Yes!  And I do it to scare her because she's very jumpy.  I go, I'm just trying to teach you how vulnerable you are.  She'll be in the house with her headphones on, washing dishes.  I just come up behind and get her a chokehold.  A chokehold.  She's a teacher.  A few stitches in the chin, but she doesn't learn.  I'll pop the headphones out the second I start pulling into my driveway and garage. 
[00:51:30]  You pop those out.  You want to be able to hear if something's going on.  You got headphones when you're driving?  Well, you know, the iPod.  You're driving with iPod earbuds?  It doesn't matter.  You stereo broke out?  No, I got that, but sometimes if you take a phone call, you can just click because I  got the iPhone, so it's an iPod and a phone, so you can just click and talk and hear.  You're one of those guys that you're wearing earbuds when you're driving?  Why not?  Everyone else is behind me. 
[00:52:00]  What if there's an ambulance behind you and somebody's hurt?  I scan my mirrors.  I know it's behind me.  I know you do.  You ever see these people?  You ever see these idiot people that got an ambulance behind them for a mile?  They're doing seven.  And they're just, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.  How could you not see or hear this?  They're the same people that don't look in the mirror when I'm like an inch from their  bumper because they're doing seven in the left lane.  How many times do you look in your rear view to make sure no one's in the back seat? 
[00:52:30]  Don't freak me out like that.  There are some days where you get a feeling almost that there's someone back there.  We've all done it, but I think you do it over and over again.  No.  Okay, no, there's no one.  Wait, wait.  What was that?  What was that sound?  Wait, let me look again.  Oh, it's a clubsaw bottle rolling around under my seat.  It's my hash pipe.  And then you're not good enough with just looking in the rearview mirror,  so you kind of make sure the car's nice and straight.  You're going 80, and you know you can take a quick little look for yourself. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Turn around real fast.  Okay, no one's back there.  I like cutting the wheel real fast to see if someone flies out.  I caught you.  Should have been buckled up.  Where's Danny?  I need Danny.  We were talking about baseball before the break,  and we should have tried to squeeze this in.  The Mets just got just pwned.  The Mets got pwned.  Do we have any more info on this thing yet, Danny?  What do you mean?  Listen to this.  Danny's got the whole story.  I didn't really get it at first, but now I think it's pretty hilarious. 
[00:53:30]  It's something called Rickrolled.  Like you can get Rickrolled.  Oh, right.  What's Rickrolled again?  What that basically means is it's kind of like the G-rated version of Meat Spin,  where instead of tricking somebody into going to Meat Spin,  you link them to the Rick Astley music video.  But explain.  You'll send an email to a buddy and go,  oh, you got to check out this thing.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Check out this knockout punch.  So they think they're going to be watching this really cool video,  and they end up watching Rick Astley.  Colin Quinn does that to me only with television.  That's how far behind we are technology-wise. 
[00:54:00]  The television.  No, I'm serious.  He'll call me up.  I'll be watching something good, and he'll go,  hey, they're doing a Bill Hicks documentary on HBO,  and I'll put it on.  It's a Billy Crystal movie.  He'll just hang up laughing.  He does it to me all the time.  What a tool.  Oh, and he does it all the time.  He gets me everything.  Oh, that's funny.  That's Rickrolling somebody in 1991.  Yeah, exactly.  We're a little behind.  I'm in my late 60s.  But you do the same thing, and they click on the link,  and instead of looking at what they thought they were going to look at,  it's Rick Astley.  It's Rick Astley in that awful,  he's never going to give you up song. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, there it is.  Right, right.  So basically, and everyone was like, he's white?  He's with red hair?  He was like a gopher at a radio station, too.  Yeah.  Was he?  Yeah.  For real, he was.  And now I think he's back doing that by the night.  That's a great dance he's got, though,  with his little arms swinging.  Hey, this is his boss today.  I'm going, Rick, I asked for a Boston cream.  Not a umbrella.  Sorry.  Could you fade that out, please?  Thank you.  Fade it. 
[00:55:00]  Just cut it.  Danny, so...  Well, the Mets were...  They do this eighth-inning sing-along thing,  and so they put up a poll on their website...  Which is a great idea.  Yeah, it's a...  Website.  ...to pick what song that they wanted to sing-along to.  They wanted the fans to pick the song.  Yeah, I read that.  I read that.  This Rick Astley song, it wasn't even an option.  It was a write-in.  Like, you had to hit other,  and then type in,  Rick Astley never going to give you up,  and it just made its way around the internet so much  that they actually got it to go through,  and it passed,  and now they have to sing-along.  Now they might be stuck...  And they booed, right?  When they played...  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, who wouldn't?  There's booze everywhere.  They might be, of course...  A couple of gay guys would love it.  Oh, yeah, they probably would like it.  They might be stuck playing this at every home game.  It's kind of a funny gimmick now, if it is.  You know, it works.  I might even go to the game just to see the reaction.  Publicity.  I saw them showing people in the stands dancing to it, I think.  Well, is that any gayer than the YMCA song?  No, it's ridiculous.  Oh, when the grounds crew come out at Yankee Stadium  and do the YMCA when they... 
[00:56:00]  It's choreographed.  Oh, it's wonderful.  My favorite is Cotton Eye Joe, though,  when they do that.  Oh, God.  The Yankees probably have the worst music  and little fun sing-along-y things.  It's not the Yankees.  Every ballpark does the same song.  The Islanders do Cotton Eye Joe.  I mean...  I hate this.  Oh, look, it's the guy in the control room.  He's singing, too.  Yeah, but it was...  It's the guy from, like, 1989. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  He's wearing L.A. gears.  Travis, what do you got on this?  The Mets actually don't want to commit to this,  so instead of just acknowledging the winner  and going along with the bit,  they're playing a different song every day this week,  and then at the end of the week,  out of those seven songs,  the fans will get to vote on each one of those songs.  So they're copping out and realize that they got screwed.  They got screwed over by just a bunch of...  That's funny.  Well, we'll pull that off. 
[00:57:00]  Well, hey, uh...  There's some idiot that just thinks  they could do an internet vote  that it's not going to be tainted by something.  You know, when it was the old days  with Ralph Kiner,  send in your postcards,  and we'll pick the favorite song.  You know, then who's going to write out  like 10 million postcards.  Right.  But somebody just gets a program.  It's like, click, click, click, click, click,  vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote, vote.  Yeah.  Actually, we're in the middle of doing that  with that radio...  Of course we are.  ...Rochester Radio Madness contest.  How are we doing in that? 
[00:57:30]  Are we winning?  I have a kick in Rover's ass.  Kicking his ass, right?  I haven't even looked at it in a few days.  This is the latest update.  We're on in Rochester  on a station called The Zone,  and they're doing a whole thing  where it's like kind of brackets,  like the NCAA.  Like March Madness.  And it's all the radio guys in Rochester.  Oh.  And so we got all our guys  just freaking voting around the clock.  We're going to just win the whole thing.  We're going to crush them.  Yeah, so we got 69% of the vote,  and Rover's got 30%. 
[00:58:00]  That's our latest matchup.  Oh, boy.  Kicking Rover's ass.  Real seat squirmer, huh?  Yeah, and then when we get by Rover,  we're going to have to take on  Morning Drive with Gately and Julie.  Oh, no, another hole.  I don't know if we can handle that.  I don't know.  Julie's got a real edge to her.  Well, look at this.  They must really suck  because they make them do radio  from 5 in the morning.  This is their shift  because, like, it shows our shift,  2 to 5 p.m. in the afternoons up there.  Yeah.  They go from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day. 
[00:58:30]  Are you kidding me?  No.  What are they doing?  Making sneakers?  12-year-old Vietnamese girl,  70-hour.  They're doing a 9-hour show every day.  Stop it.  For pennies, by the way,  I guarantee it.  So that's going to be  our next competition,  Morning Drive with Gately and Julie.  I feel sorry for them.  I don't know.  I got you guys plus or minus 100.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's the spread on that?  Yeah, we got the favorite.  So anyway, getting back to the Mets thing,  it leads to the report on it.  And the reason we play this today 
[00:59:00]  is because it's done  by our favorite reporter.  Smug guy?  Smug guy is not our favorite reporter.  Oh, he's kind of my favorite.  You got to think deep.  We haven't played in a while.  Is it somebody that was assaulted  in the media?  You got it, E-Rock?  You know, the  Take Me to the Waldorf Astoria.  Oh, that guy.  Astoria.  Yeah, well, he's doing the report here.  And then we'll play that  Waldorf Astoria clip again.  But here, here's the story.  Pat, the one other thing  that we were talking about,  which is kind of interesting,  is this whole thing with  the song that's going to be sang 
[00:59:30]  during the eighth inning every day,  the sing-along song?  Oh, yeah.  And the Mets had a contest.  Yeah, they asked us a contest, right?  And then they've injected  Rick Astley into this.  Yeah, these pranksters, I guess.  It's been injected.  What makes you say that?  You got the guy back at,  you know, the news station.  He could care less.  Listen to how excited he is  about this story.  Injected Rick Astley into this. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, these pranksters, I guess.  They got out there  and they got the word out  and they got the Rick Astley song  Never Gonna Give You Up  as one of the top vote-getters.  So there's a chance  that that could be the sing-along song,  which, I don't know  how great that would be, you know?  Oh, come on.  We all know the words, Roger.  Never gonna give you up.  I was waiting for you to do it.  Never gonna let you down.  Down.  Never gonna run around 
[01:00:30]  and desert you.  Is this the news?  Is this the news?  Is it?  I don't know the words.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Wow.  Can we fade this report  to black now and make it in?  I think I'm about to see brown-eyed.  I'm gonna go with brown-eyed girl, I think.  Yeah.  Brown-eyed something.  Thanks, Roger.  Could you...  The Yankees wrapped up there.  That's the news.  That's the news.  Could you imagine Cronkite?  Never gonna give you up.  Never gonna let you down.  Never gonna run around and ditch. 
[01:01:00]  For a song that everybody hates,  everybody seems to know the words.  They know the words.  It was funny.  Well, it was popular back in the day, Nick.  Yeah, well, believe me,  I got laid to that  at the Palace Nightclub in Saugus twice.  You're talking...  That was like, seriously, in the 80s.  That was like...  That was...  Oh, yeah, that song was...  Dancing, sweating...  Definitely being played.  Dropping pills and girls' drinks.  It was a wonderful time.  Plop, plop, fizz, fizz.  Hey, wake up, Pam.  What happened?  Why is your skirt over your head on the subway? 
[01:01:30]  Always remember,  take Polaroids first  so you know exactly how they were dressed.  You don't want to screw that up.  It's like a continuity guy on a movie set.  You know?  You gotta take pictures.  How full was that glass?  Make sure you just take some Polaroids  and go,  Oh, the top button wasn't buttoned.  Yeah, top up or sprites.  That was about half empty.  Yeah, Rick Ashley.  Oh, boy.  Hey, let's play the Roger Clark Waldorf Astoria clip. 
[01:02:00]  Does this need a setup?  It does?  Another jam.  Yeah, it's Roger Clark at the Astoria.  I don't know if it needs a setup,  but this is one of our favorites.  So that's what's happening,  but the big story is traffic, Pat.  You know, and every time I think of the Waldorf Astoria  and I think of world leaders,  I think of coming to America  when James Earl Jones came to find Eddie Murphy.  And he's like,  Where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  And that's where, I guess, the presidents get... 
[01:02:30]  So where else would you meet with world leaders  other than the Waldorf Astoria?  It makes sense, right?  Yeah.  Foreign policy for the masses, I guess, is his, Roger, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you've boiled it all down.  Presidents are busy with meetings.  Waldorf Astoria is a good place to be.  Chock full of information.  And, of course, we know the traffic restrictions.  We're going to put all this traffic information 
[01:03:00]  on our website as well.  It's a lot to take.  Yeah.  Roger, thank you.  Oh, did he hang him out to dry?  Oh, like a piece of pursuit.  Oh, he just...  He just did not give him anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, that's...  Well, you know, world leaders,  the world of Astoria...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, great.  Yeah, that is a fantastic clip.  Nick DiPaolo sitting in for Jim Norton. 
[01:03:30]  We were talking about college hockey during the break.  Oh, yeah?  Nick's a big college hockey fan.  And, what, it's BC versus Notre Dame in the finals?  Yeah, for the national championship.  This weekend?  Yeah, which is...  I mean, Notre Dame is not a hockey program.  This is, like, huge.  This would be like, I don't know,  Vermont winning the NCAA basketball, you know, tournament.  Right, right.  And they were, like, the fourth seed or whatever.  You know, they just snuck into the tournament.  And they beat Michigan last night, who's, like...  A powerhouse.  Yeah, a powerhouse. 
[01:04:00]  They're literally the...  They win everything.  Yeah.  Well, they've won a lot, anyway.  And I went to bed...  What an idiot I am.  I know I have to get up.  I set my alarm before 4.30 to be here today,  because I live, you know, 35 miles from here.  But I'm sitting...  It's 12.30.  I'm still watching a meaningless hockey game.  Whoa.  Yeah, my wife's like, what are you doing?  Oh, that hurts.  And I shut it off, though, before...  When it's overtime, I shut it off, which I never do.  Yeah.  They have the best fights, too, in college hockey.  Do they allow bench brawls?  No, no.  Bench clearing brawls?  They took that out of college hockey as well? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, there's not even that much...  You can't really fight in college hockey,  because you get booted for the next game.  But it's much more...  Well, there's a lot of great hits.  Well...  A lot of good hits.  Yeah, and they're headhunters, and they wear the masks.  You know, all the players have masks on their helmets.  Right.  Every one of them, so...  By rule.  So they carry the sticks up high, and it gets vicious.  Yeah.  I mean, hey, they're 19-year-old guys,  and they fly around, and they crack each other.  I used to go...  I went to the University of Maine,  which turned into a powerhouse.  They're in, like, the final foremost every year in hockey, 
[01:05:00]  except for this year.  But I used to go to the games up there.  You couldn't get a ticket, man.  I mean, it was crazy.  I mean, fast and violent.  It's just...  Yeah, they have nothing to lose.  They're just probably trying to make a name for themselves.  Yeah.  I mean, they're not getting paid,  so it means a lot to them and stuff.  But this...  They've got that kid mentality.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They absolutely have nothing to lose.  Right after the season,  they're going into some meaningless job  for the next 20 or 30 years.  This is it for them, man.  Well, a lot of...  They're going to hit hard and often. 
[01:05:30]  But now a lot of...  The NHL has a lot of college.  Right.  It used to be the junior hockey leagues up in Canada  where they got all their talent.  But now most of it's coming out of the colleges.  Yeah.  So this is Saturday.  The national championship, if anybody cares.  I don't know.  A lot of people have...  You know, New York's a big basketball town, but...  Not this year.  Notre Dame.  Yeah, not this year.  Notre Dame and B.C., two Catholic schools.  You got me interested.  I'm going to watch this damn thing now.  But we were talking about college hockey, 
[01:06:00]  and then it led to, like, talking about old-time sports  and talking about our ancestors and how dumb they were  that they couldn't figure out basic crap.  And it was about hockey where, like, back in the old days,  hockey, like the goalposts, were pretty much cemented  into the foundation of the arena.  Yeah, they were on pegs, steel pegs, like 12 inches high.  Right.  And no one could figure out that maybe you should let this, like,  you know, break away if someone is going to hit this thing.  But can I defend that?  Yeah, go ahead.  I don't like the way it is now, where you look at the thing, 
[01:06:30]  the net rock, and it comes off.  Because every time there's a scramble in the crease,  somebody knocks the net off the borings.  Well, because now it's on just a little rubber thing or something.  They get two little midgets holding it.  Yeah, right.  You're right.  But the old days, these things didn't move.  It was like a light post.  Yeah, exactly.  Like a fire hydrant.  And you're hitting a telephone pole.  Right.  Pretty much.  And he was telling me, like, how the nets have the crease in the back end.  The net, they split the nets in half. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, in the middle.  And one guy went flying into the net, right?  The crotch first.  Yeah.  Crotch first.  Oh.  It actually went up his butt.  He had to get sewed up.  Wow.  This is in the late 80s, early 90s.  But, yeah, if you look at a hockey net, it comes to a point in the middle.  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about?  And that thing came up, and he crashed into a backwards.  Yeah.  Oh, emergency surgery.  Oh.  It penetrated his pants and his pants.  Wow.  Right.  If I could say so.  So, I think maybe the listeners could help us with his bit. 
[01:07:30]  And that guy, Rick Astley.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More examples of our ancestors just being stupid and not being able to figure crap out.  Until enough stuff happened.  Well, another one with hockey, like, no goalie mask for a long time.  Yeah.  You would think if you were, like, you're going to invent a sport like this, that the first  thing you would think of, well, the guy we're shooting the puck at, maybe he should have  some kind of face protection.  But we were stupid, our ancestors.  The last guy not to wear a goalie mask? 
[01:08:00]  No.  How old are you, Ope?  Are you my age?  I'm 44.  44.  I see him as a guy.  We say 44.  44.  44.  Who's the last guy?  I used to know this.  I don't know.  Gump Worsley.  Wow.  For the Minnesota North Stars.  Wow.  Looked like a, he looked like a, you know, like a homeless white guy.  He's got a crew cut.  Literally.  He looks like a goalie who never wore a mask.  He's got 160 stitches in his face.  He had a flat nose.  And he insisted, I'm the last one, man. 
[01:08:30]  I'm not wearing a mask.  He's the last one to not wear it.  And it's just, you look at his, it's hilarious looking at his pictures.  Well, when they started forcing the guys to wear like helmets, there were some old timers.  I guess they made the rule where you didn't have to, if you came into the league after  a certain year.  So it was really weird as the transition was happening.  Like everyone else would have a helmet except one guy.  You know who that one guy was?  I know.  Ron Duguay.  No.  He wanted his flowing locks of hair to show.  Who was the last guy?  Craig McTavish.  See, I used to know this stuff. 
[01:09:00]  This guy used to be a boss.  Well, you should know him.  Sounds like someone that came over on the Mayflower.  Well, he actually killed somebody in a drunk driving accident.  Oh, okay.  He got a couple years.  And then, you know, he gets out of jail like six months later.  He's dancing in a bar in Montreal drunk again.  But he was the last guy.  He wouldn't wear a helmet.  Well, someone says they called him Crash McTavish after that.  Yeah.  That's right.  So I guess more examples of our ancestors just being stupid.  And it doesn't have to stick with sports.  It's like baseball. 
[01:09:30]  You know, there was a time they couldn't figure out that you might need something on your hand  if you're going to be catching this ball.  See, I didn't know that.  Did they actually play without a glove?  They started barehanded.  Is that right?  And then they just put like a regular glove on.  Well, then they couldn't figure out how to get like the webbing.  A farmer's glove.  So it was like you were wearing a frying pan trying to catch this ball.  I was going to say I never saw footage.  Oh, I didn't have any cameras back then.  It was 1653 BC. 
[01:10:00]  Let's turn a double play with bare hands.  That'll be fine.  It'd be hard to pick one out of the dirt, wouldn't it, if you're a first baseman?  Let's say how to Emmett in Jersey.  Emmett.  Cocktail glove on up to your elbow.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, we're trying to do a phone-in radio bit today.  So what do you got?  Nick, I used to love your show.  By the way.  Thank you very much, Jerry.  A lot of people.  Appreciate it.  I canceled you.  Remember the old Leatherhead days?  The Leatherhead days with the old H-shaped goal posts in the early 70s.  Where the post was right at the front of the goal line. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  Another example of our ancestors being stupid.  Your whole mission is to get over the goal line.  And what's in a way, two huge poles.  Two huge poles.  Again, I liked it better when it was on the goal line.  People used to run into it and knock themselves out.  Oh, it was hysterical.  You've got to ruin it for safety purposes.  This is just a bunch of girlies.  Yeah, put it way in the back.  So what?  You get paralyzed trying to make a catch over there.  That's the best folly films right there.  The best folly films.  Very nice.  All right, boys.  Thank you, Emmett.  Jason, North Carolina, what's up? 
[01:11:00]  Hey, instead of the plexiglass on the boards and the hockey rinks, they used to have chain-link  fence.  That's right.  Yeah, I was telling Nick.  Oh, yeah.  I don't remember that.  If you go to ESPN Classic, every once in a while, they'll show a hockey game from like  the late 50s, early 60s, somewhere around there.  And yeah, it's chain-link fence instead of plexiglass.  Well, I think that was more that we didn't invent plexiglass yet.  And I don't think you could put panes of glass around a hole.  Oh, that would be great.  Right?  Like glass?  Right.  Hilarious.  Nice, thin sheet.  Some kids up front with their parents. 
[01:11:30]  Not even safety glass.  The stuff that goes into shards that are like shivs.  Let's go to Kim in Staten Island.  Kim?  Hi, guys.  Hi, Kim.  I just wanted to add, what about girls wearing skirts during baseball?  Yeah, their uniform was skirts.  The guys weren't complaining.  First of all, who watched women's baseball?  What, the women's league?  What are you going to see if a girl playing baseball was wearing a skirt?  Her nuts?  Did all the way Mae playing a skirt, Opie? 
[01:12:00]  I believe so, yes.  I know Opie had a relative there.  Who was she related to you, Hal?  She's my great aunt.  Great aunt?  And she's a nun in western New York.  And she's got to be 90-something.  She was all the way Mae from a league of their own.  Maybe 95 at this point.  Yeah, the one that who played Madonna played her.  Yeah, but you know what?  Funny she's a nun.  I got to tell you, though.  A story came out about one of these old broads.  Yeah.  I think it was in the Boston Herald.  And this old broad they had said that Madonna played her. 
[01:12:30]  She played her in the movie, so now I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Is all the way Mae a liar?  All the way Mae was legendary in women's baseball back in the day.  Legendary with the guys?  Oh, shut up.  She went all the way around the bases.  Oh, is that what it was?  Of course.  Yeah, right to the bases.  She's a nun, you creep.  But then this old broad, they're saying Madonna played her in the movie.  So now I don't know.  Now you don't know.  Oh, boy.  She was one of the players.  Yeah.  Maybe she was Rosie O'Donnell. 
[01:13:00]  I was going to say, long as Rosie didn't play.  Oh, flatso.  That thing, huh?  Her ass is like a backstop.  Yeah.  Flatter than a diet coke has been left out.  Enous body.  All right, listen.  We got a good bit going.  So examples of our ancestors being stupid.  We don't have to stick with sports.  We started with sports.  We got a couple NASCAR things that we'll get to after the break here, okay?  But other things.  I'm trying to think of other stuff in just regular day life.  Regular life.  Maybe some things you work with.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:13:30]  Nick DiPaolo in for Jim Norton today.  Go to nickdip.com.  That's the big plug today, okay?  And it has all his tour dates, including the one for this new comedy club that has a horrendous name.  The Comedy Shop.  That part's not bad, but at 815 is a little confusing.  Yeah, Comedy Shop at 815 is the name of the club.  Yeah.  But Nick will be doing shows, I think, around 7 and 10.  No, we don't.  7.30 and 10, maybe.  Don't throw anything out there.  I don't even know what time the show's at.  Just Friday and Saturday night next week.  All right. 
[01:14:00]  Go to nickdip.com.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right.  We got to go right to the phones.  We're on to something.  877-212-ON-A.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Nickdip.com for Nick DiPaolo.  He's sitting in today.  Examples of our ancestors just being stupid and not figuring things out for us.  My sister not shaving in high school.  Let's go with, we'll start off with Rick in Brooklyn.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  In order to waterproof their hats and keep their clothes nice and rigid, the pilgrims used  to soak everything in mercury.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  Yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah.  What did they know?  Where'd you learn that off a placemat?  What?  Wow.  Okay.  That's kind of a silly thing.  I never heard that.  Yeah.  I don't know what we could do with that, but it just sounds crazy.  That didn't really evolve.  We haven't.  Right.  And that, I don't think, is something that, yeah, I think that's something that you just  didn't know. 
[01:15:00]  They couldn't tell.  Hey, mercury, you know, it's going to turn your kids retarded because you're wearing  a wacky hat.  Right.  Now we're soaking them in, what, creosote?  That didn't really evolve at all.  That just went away.  That was like when they came out with the x-ray machine and they put them in shoe stores.  And it was a massive dose of radiation.  The shoe store?  Yes.  The shoe stores started getting this x-ray machine because it was like a gimmick almost.  Like they would look at the bones in your feet and tell you, oh, you need this type 
[01:15:30]  of shoe.  So you'd stick your feet in this machine.  It would just be bombarded with like horrid amounts of radiation.  I've never heard such a thing.  And it would be like, yes.  Do you ever see all the old people walking around with feet missing?  You need a much wider shoe as I look at the bones in your feet.  It's just this awful.  That's more of a we just didn't know.  It was a novelty.  The whole x-ray thing was a novelty.  So they'd have this massive amount of radiation just go right through your hand. 
[01:16:00]  And it wasn't focused.  So it would just go all over the place.  That's hilarious.  You're in there pricing sandals and you leave with a lump in your thyroid.  Exactly.  That's the bit we'll do next week.  The we just didn't know bit.  We just didn't know.  This is more like the obvious stuff.  Yeah.  I'd never heard such a thing.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, when I first read that, I was laughing my ass off.  These idiots with their fedoras walking in.  I'd like to see the bones in my feet, sir. 
[01:16:30]  Well, okay.  Put your feet in here.  We'll irradiate you with this magical uranium.  And look at the bones in your feet.  And you could light a lucky strike off your toenails when you're done.  Just amazing.  Just amazing.  Wonderful.  See, you seem to have a bit of a hammer toe problem.  We could see right through your foot.  Actually, we could see through to the core of the earth.  It's maybe a little strong. 
[01:17:00]  And then you fast forward a few decades and you get an x-ray in the dentist's office.  Oh, he's wearing a suit of armor.  They're wearing a suit of armor.  They put that lead vest on you.  And then the lady sets it just right and runs out of the room.  Runs out.  Okay, don't move.  Don't move.  Runs behind some thick lead glass.  Right.  And it's two seconds.  Bam.  You just hear.  Bam.  All right, enough.  Don't ever get one again.  Right.  We can only do that once every five years. 
[01:17:30]  In the old days.  Sure.  Stick Junior's face under there.  Right.  Well, look at his brain.  You know the first x-ray machine.  It wasn't just, you know, you say they were just putting their feet in.  But, yeah.  Oh, put everything.  Oh, I want to see how my hand looks.  Hey, look, Charlie.  My skull looks.  Sure.  No problem.  Yeah.  Looks like the elephant man with brain tumors.  I've never heard such a thought.  Oh, it's fantastic.  That's beautiful.  Who started that?  We just didn't know.  We just didn't know.  Whose idea was that?  Right.  Well, so.  We'll do that one day. 
[01:18:00]  We just didn't know.  Yeah, we'll do the.  Write that down for next week.  We just didn't know bit.  But, Michael, Atlanta, what's up?  Yeah, I'm not sure we had warfare figured out.  In, like, the Revolutionary War or Civil War, you just line up all pretty and take turns  shooting at each other until somebody runs out of men.  Yeah, that was a little wacky.  Actually, worse than that, when we were fighting the Revolutionary War, some guys, instead of  getting guns for the war, they got a drum kit. 
[01:18:30]  Drum a flute.  Now, that's what I'm getting at.  Ambush.  That's not a, we just didn't know.  That is just stupidity.  Who would sign up to be the drum guy?  Or the, or the Fife guy.  Yeah.  Or the guy that just carried the flag.  Carried the flag.  While your buddies have guns around you.  Command a buddy rich.  Right.  The whole, the whole thing with battle back then was they knew when and where the battle  was going to be.  There wasn't an ambush.  There wasn't an airstrike. 
[01:19:00]  So, you could be loud.  You would come wheeling up to this music.  Yeah.  And they go, all right, they're up on that hill.  We're down here.  We got to get up there.  It was more of a, it was more of a sport.  Yeah, it was a war of attrition.  You had to kill more of them than they killed of you.  And then you won that battle.  It's like taking on the Michigan marching band.  At halftime, showing up with guns.  Medic, he got me with a trombone.  Tuba, Tuba, play it down. 
[01:19:30]  Amputate his lips.  Oh, just a horrible way to fight a war.  Who's the first guy that thought, you know something?  If we go around their side, I think we'll call it flanking.  Flanking, yes.  They won't expect us there.  And I think we'll kick their ass.  As they're all lined up facing forward, they get the side of their heads blown out.  Right.  This tactic kind of works.  Let's go to Juan in Brick, New Jersey. 
[01:20:00]  Juan, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, thank you.  I wholeheartedly agree.  Thank you, sir.  Listen, I got two of them.  One sports and one non-sports related.  Okay.  All right, the monuments in Yankee Stadium out on the field.  Yes.  Good one.  Good one.  There was a time the monuments were just in the middle of center field, basically.  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  They're trying to run down a fly ball.  Let's put a few tombstones around second base. 
[01:20:30]  Trying to run down a fly ball and you get knocked out by Babe Ruth.  That's what you want to bang you.  We've been dead for 50 years.  Oh, bang your shin on.  Oh, God.  Bang your shin on granite.  Imagine chasing a fly ball and you hit your knee on a tombstone.  How would that hurt?  Open your shin up like a fresh mackerel.  Oh, that's got to hurt.  Hey, Juan, that's a good one.  That's an excellent one.  You got another one?  Yeah.  How about when they first started putting seat belts in the car, our parents would put 
[01:21:00]  us in the back and not buckle us up and we'd just be flying around everywhere when they  slam on the brakes.  You know what, though?  I think there's nothing wrong with that.  I never got hurt.  Did you?  So what?  I maybe hurt a little.  You know, you'd sometimes whack your face against the back of the front seat, but you're alive.  Well, the stupidity with the seat belts, first of all, having one that just went around  your waist.  That was good.  Let's bend you in half like a folding bed.  Exactly.  But the other one also, the stupidity, like seat belts for the people in the front and 
[01:21:30]  no one even thought that maybe you need seat belts in the back as well because it's pretty  much the same thing.  Yeah.  You're in the same vehicle.  You're in the same situation.  They just thought, ah, the seats will stop them.  Right.  I remember as a kid, we had an old Rambler, an old Rambler.  And a lot of the cars back then had what is called the rear deck lid.  A lot of cars don't have that anymore, but it was just behind your head in the back seat  was a little flat portion that had speakers in it sometimes. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was just by your back window of your car.  Yeah.  And it was perfectly acceptable as a child to crawl up there and fall asleep.  Yeah.  And if you got into a collision, you would become a child missile that would probably  take your parents out and whatever was in front of the car flying at 60 miles an hour  through the windshield.  Decapitate mom.  Yeah.  With your little baby.  You and the little box of tissues that were back there for grandma. 
[01:22:30]  But I think we're becoming over-evolved and civilized.  Oh, absolutely.  You see kids now, they're in literally a suit of armor with a hockey helmet and 11 straps  around their neck.  Come on.  Not allowed in the front seat because the airbag might hurt them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My father used to do cat stops like the cops do when you get arrested.  You know, they hit the brakes.  Your face goes into that screen.  He used to do that to shut us up.  My favorite, too, with my dad was because the seatbelts, you didn't wear them.  They were shoved so far in the seat.  They were covered with dried up McDonald's French fries. 
[01:23:00]  And Cracker Jacks.  Yeah, all kinds of gook was down there.  So you just got in.  But he was there to help you out because his miracle arm could go up and keep you from hitting  the dashboard at any speed.  Hey, I'll hold you up.  I care.  We just didn't understand physics.  That's when he didn't have a beer in that hand, by the way.  When the beer was in there, it was a little more important than saving me from the frigging  stainless steel dashboard.  But they keep doing it, even when you're an adult. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You're like 19 now, and your old man's trying to stop you.  It's embarrassing, Dad.  How long did you wait 205 for Christ's sake?  I'm going to slap your arm.  Let's say hi to Joe in Boston listening on BCN.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Joe.  My favorite thing, I've got to say, is who was the rocket scientist to figure out that  when basketball was invented, you had to cut a hole in the bottom of the peach basket  instead of throwing up a ladder to grab the ball every time?  There was a time, Joe is so correct, that they couldn't figure out to cut a hole in the  bottom of the peach basket, so every time you scored a basket, and they actually used peach 
[01:24:00]  baskets back in the day, they had to break out the ladder and climb up and get the ball.  I'm convinced that a basketball game back in that day must have took seven and a half  hours.  Yeah.  And the score was six to two.  Not much dunking either.  No.  I just want to shout out Toucher and Rich in Boston.  Right on, man.  They're doing a fine, fine job up there.  Uh, let's say hi to Ziggy in D.C. 
[01:24:30]  Ziggy.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey.  What up?  I just wanted to say the, uh, the term mad as a hatter comes from, uh, the mercury in  the hats that I was talking about earlier.  Oh, really?  The guys that ate the hats, they would, uh, kind of bite down on the rim of the hats to  help shape the hats, and, you know, they're actually eating mercury.  So, that's where the term mad as a hatter comes from.  I don't know what's more stupid, the putting the mercury in the hat or biting down on the  shape the rim.  Biting the mercury hat and shaping the rim. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  There was a, I know, uh, years ago, uh, they used to make watches, and there were these  women that would sit there and actually hand paint the glowing, uh, numbers.  And they'd sit there, and they'd need a very fine brush.  So, to, to get the tip very pointy, they would lick it and roll it on their tongue and then  dip it into this radium paint.  Nah, nah.  And they were just dropping dead by the dozens.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Where?  Where was that?  This was like in a lot of, uh, uh, cities, uh, in, in the Midwest.  Uh, a lot of places that, uh, made watches, and they'd sit there and just roll it on their  tongue and then dip it in the radium and, and paint the little dots for the numbers so  it would glow in the dark.  They were called, uh, radium girls.  Ooh, the radium girls.  Hot.  The woman subjected to radiation exposure at the United States, uh, Radium Corporation  Factory.  Radium Corporation Factory.  In Orange, New Jersey. 
[01:26:00]  Wonderful.  Around 1917.  1917.  The five female workers gained notoriety for their efforts in challenging their employer  in court.  Wow.  That must have went over well.  Shut up, bitch.  Right.  The women and many other radium paint workers received large doses of radiation.  A few of the so-called radium girls died as a result of their previous radiation exposure  during the course of the litigation.  I'd like to call my witness.  Get up here, baldy.  Would you like to testify? 
[01:26:30]  Her tongue's just burnt away.  That looks like a ballpark Frank in her mouth.  Oh, my God.  DJ in New Jersey, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  You know, as a hockey fan, Nick, a lot of people forget this.  Remember, like, what, like six, seven seasons ago, it took them to try to put the nets up  before 20 people got killed by pucks?  Well, I think this goes back to overprotecting and stuff.  One dopey broad wasn't paying attention and took a puck to the skull and died. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, and it hadn't happened for how long?  For literally 80.  I think she was the only one.  Every once in a while, a puck would fly into the stands and you would get a few stitches  or something.  Yeah.  But they would give you a free hot dog.  You'd be all right.  Well, yeah.  And a free puck or whatever.  Yeah.  But then one girl died behind the net.  Young girl, of course.  One.  So now they wrecked the view of everybody that sits behind the goal.  I'm with you on that one else.  Yeah, you don't need that.  The nets go all the way up to the ceiling now.  You can't even get a souvenir.  You used to want to sit back there to get a souvenir. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, there's a happy fan with a concussion.  Let's see if we've got a couple more here.  We have a guy that had one of those x-ray machines you were talking about.  What?  Mark in Pennsylvania.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Yeah, we had one of those.  My great-grandfather, grandfather, and a couple more generations had shoe stores in  northeastern Pennsylvania.  And we used to play with that thing when we were kids.  Well, nice of knowing you.  I used to play with it.  What?  Say that again?  Yeah, we'd like, you know, bring friends in, stick your arms under, elbows. 
[01:28:00]  Fortunately for us, you couldn't get your head under it, or I guess we'd all find out.  And basically, in the early 60s, somebody came by from the government with a lead box  and dismantled it and took it away.  Oh, really?  A lead box.  The government had to, they figured it out.  The government's like, oh, my God, we've got to get rid of these things.  You've got three.  Oh, yeah.  They were provided by Dr. Scholl's Corporation, and it was free.  And it was an expensive store.  You put your feet in, you could see where you're at.  It was a novelty item where people would come in just to see the x-ray of their feet, and 
[01:28:30]  it would bring people into the stores.  It wasn't, was it to help fit the shoe?  They said that, but obviously, it wasn't, you could just measure the feet and put it  in a goddamn shoe.  But it was kind of a novelty thing that would bring people into the shoe stores.  Yeah, it was quite the novelty, though.  Yeah, it sure was.  You could see through yourself with massive doses of radiation.  This guy's laughing.  He's probably got like three white cells left, right?  You're done, dude.  You are so done. 
[01:29:00]  Take it easy.  All right.  There's blood in my urine.  Let's go to Steve in Brooklyn.  Steve, you got one?  Yeah.  If you're about 40 or over, I think drug driving was not even illegal in most states.  Yeah, we all have our stories about the cop that would take your keys and kind of throw  them in the woods or say he'll be back in a few hours, get some sleep, or drive safe  home, or follow me home.  When did they make it illegal?  Is that true?  No, it was always illegal.  Well, not always, but back then it was.  But they were a lot more lenient about it. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, the cop would decide.  They didn't want to deal with, you know.  Hey, just a bunch of dopey teenagers drinking underage.  Yeah.  I still think it's over-exaggerated, the dangers of drinking and driving.  Yeah.  I really do.  How many bars in the country?  How many people drink on the weekends?  A lot.  600 million?  Seriously.  And how many people die?  Let's break it down.  It's got to be 0.001%.  Of a percent of how many people are actually drinking and driving. 
[01:30:00]  But we talk about it like if you have, you know, you look at a bottle of wine, you're  going to take out a family of six.  Once again, mothers against drugs.  Anytime you get the chicks involved, it gets over-exaggerated.  Yeah.  And we're sorry you lost your daughter, but, you know, I can handle a six-pack.  I've been defending this my whole life.  I consider myself a pretty good drunk driver.  Of course you do.  Up to a point.  You know, if you drink to the point where you can't stand up, you're not going to be  that good.  Yeah.  But after a few beers where you'd probably be legally drunk. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  You know.  0.08.  Yeah.  0.08.  0.08, you're fine.  Are you kidding me?  I'm just getting warmed up here.  Yeah.  0.08.  I've been advocating this for a while, and I hope to get it into legislation when I become  a politician someday.  Based on my past history on this program, that'll happen.  Yeah.  Um, I would like to see a rating that you could get on your license that they set up  a test.  It costs a lot of money.  Let's, let's, you know, let the states make money off of this, where you get a rating on  your license that gives you a blood alcohol level that you can drive with. 
[01:31:00]  And you have to take a pretty intricate driving test as you're drinking, they, they check  your blood alcohol level and see how well you do on this course.  If you pass up to a certain point, you get rated for that blood alcohol level.  So when you're driving, you could blow in, maybe instead of a 0.08, you blow a 0.12, but  you're rated for a 0.14.  Wow.  And the officer goes, all right, you're free to go. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, that would be impressive.  You're all right.  Obviously you did the test.  You're fine to drive.  Imagine a real politician trying to get this through.  No, never.  Ted Kennedy would be doing it.  I think it's a good idea.  I love it.  I love it.  Especially when I'm driving women home over small bridges.  Let's go to Pat and Philly.  I don't know if this is true, but Pat, what's up?  Oh, and A.  Hey.  Great to hear you.  Thank you, Pat.  Back in high school, friends and I were cruising around in Old Beetle.  It was snowing, screwing around, drinking. 
[01:32:00]  Car flipped over, flipped it right back over, started up.  Cop pulled up on us, nailed us for littering, not even if you are or not.  Wow.  You don't want to do any paperwork.  Yeah, he wanted to just go home.  Yeah.  Everybody, you know how many people drink and drive?  Seriously, every day.  If you're in a bar.  What are you going to do?  Sleep over?  There are carts downstairs?  The people that are in there are drinking and then driving home.  They're not hitchhiking.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Seriously.  It's so silly.  Every club at night that you go into and see them, they're packed with people, they're  drinking, and then they drive.  Designated driver.  What?  Oh, please.  Who uses that?  The designated driver program.  Yeah.  That means you have a fuddy-duddy in there that's going to give you grief, bring everyone  down.  You're all laughing about nonsense because you're all drunk, and he's there, ugh, not  funny.  Who's getting dropped off first?  Don't puke in my car.  Or you went the other way, and the designated driver got loaded. 
[01:33:00]  Got drunk?  Got drunker than everyone.  Better than a designated driver, I think it's a waste, is the designated decoy.  That's the guy that leaves the bar first and drives erratically, but he's stone sober.  Now, he gets the cop's attention, and when the cop pulls him over, everyone else leaves.  It's helping everyone.  The designated driver just helps the guys that he's driving home.  The designated drunk, or the designated decoy, he helps the whole bar. 
[01:33:30]  They could all leave at once.  They'd just flee the area.  And all he has to do is tell the cop, I dropped the cassette.  Yeah, I dropped something.  I'm fine.  All right, you want to blow into this thing a chicken with blood alcohol?  Sure.  Yeah.  And sprites all night.  Zero point zero again, my friend.  Zero, zero, and everybody's just weaving down the road, going in the opposite direction.  Kenny Rogers used to do a bit.  He'd like to pull up to those roadblocks and act like he's really drunk out of his mind.  Just hammered.  But he's completely sober.  And the cop goes, sir, get out of the car.  And he goes, no, why don't you get in? 
[01:34:00]  Someone wanted to talk about dogfights as a dumb thing we used to do.  Our ancestors.  Did we, though?  Wait a minute.  We're still doing it, aren't we?  Yeah.  A certain segment of the population?  No, I'm in the air.  Oh, dogfighting.  Well, I kind of went out with the missile.  Sure.  Kind of went out with the missile they could shoot over the horizon.  That was necessary, man.  Yeah.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Hey, good afternoon, morning, whatever, boys.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, the iron lung.  What the hell is that?  I saw that in a hospital, so it was a time machine.  I wanted to go back in time and kick the eye in the nugget bag.  The iron lung.  The iron lung.  Exactly.  What was that used for?  Anthony was around when that was infected, right?  That was for people that got...  He's a fan of knowledge, TB?  Was it polio or something?  TB?  It was something that paralyzed your diaphragm.  So you couldn't...  Your diaphragm didn't move in and out, so the iron lung would actually be an artificial diaphragm 
[01:35:00]  and suck air in your body and push it out.  It's pretty twisted.  I was in the audience at my last show.  I was in Miami and Olga.  Yeah, those things are definitely...  They always ended up in, like, some wacky Marx Brothers comedy with a wheel and someone  around in an iron lung and wacky music's playing.  It just sounds uncomfortable.  Yeah, C-Rock?  It was for polio?  Polio.  Yeah.  Iron lung.  Oh, that polio paralyzed your diaphragm?  Yeah, it would paralyze your diaphragm so you couldn't breathe. 
[01:35:30]  So would a good meal at Pepsi's.  Not very convenient to travel around in an iron lung.  Let's go to a movie.  I can't.  I'm in an iron lung.  You had to look through the mirror, the tilted mirror like you're a bus driver, looking  at unruly students.  Who threw gum at me?  Yeah.  They look at that big, wide mirror.  Jesus.  Good one.  Iron lung.  What have we replaced it with, though?  Yeah, what the hell? 
[01:36:00]  I guess the cure to polio.  Oh, that's right.  Jonas Salk.  A tight sweater.  What did we cure it with?  The cure for polio.  Yeah.  Thanks for working on that.  Oh, my God.  With that curse, we'll take a break.  Nick DePaul sitting in for Jim Norton today.  Go to nickdip.com.  We'll continue with this, basically talking about how our ancestors didn't have things  figured out and they were just stupid.  Very, very stupid.  We've got a bunch more to get to on the phones. 
[01:36:30]  And we'll try to get a few more things in here as well.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony, good morning.  I want to say hi to everybody in Syracuse.  Good morning, Syracuse.  That's the place.  And how about Cleveland?  Good morning, Cleveland.  Hi, Cleveland.  877-212-ON-A.  We've got Nick DePaul in for Jim Norton. 
[01:37:00]  And go to nickdip.com.  It's a fine, fine website.  It does a video blog.  Yeah.  Go to that forum.  Huh?  Go to my forum and register.  Whatever the hell that means.  And register.  Blow it up.  You've got a ton of fans, right?  Oh, yeah.  Go to nickdip.com.  Get them some people to register.  Yeah, just load up there.  Just cause heaven.  But see, when I go to a website and have to register for some, I just move on now.  I know.  I can't be bothered.  Okay.  I'm sorry, but...  It's a different level of riffraff you get. 
[01:37:30]  If there's no registration at all, you're just going to get, like, nothing but awful riffraff.  Right.  Complete, just nothing constructive.  Right.  Then if they have to register, it gets a little better.  And if they have to pay something, then you're just getting the upper crusty...  Yeah, it's like high taxes is to keep the riffraff out.  Kevin Smith did that with his site.  He would get nothing but riffraff.  Like, he was sick of getting on there and people going,  Your movies suck.  You suck.  You're fat.  You're an idiot.  That's what amazes me, because it's supposed to be a fan site.  Yeah.  So he... 
[01:38:00]  There's plenty of sites out there that will trash Kevin Smith and his movies, because...  Whatever.  They don't like Kevin Smith.  It doesn't have to be his site.  So he charges a buck, or was it two bucks now?  Yeah.  He charges two bucks.  It goes to a charity, and it makes people have to pay.  And if you're just there to trash, you're not going to pay two bucks.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  Works pretty good.  It's funny you should say that, because we just signed another contract with CBS Radio.  Very happy to continue.  Yeah.  Nice going.  Yeah.  How do you do that?  Yeah, I know.  Believe me. 
[01:38:30]  How the hell do you do that?  Actually, it's got to be a perfect storm of different formats, program directors being  tossed out the door.  Yeah.  I don't have that kind of life.  You know, I'm born into the Death Star.  The PD, they...  I really am.  I'll be doing a ham radio show the rest of my life on the roof of my house.  We haven't even been here two years on regular radio again, and we're up to, I think, our  fifth PD.  Yeah, so what does that tell you?  It's not my fault.  It wasn't your fault.  We're going to get you back on radio somehow, Nick.  God bless you.  They keep getting fragged by their own people. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good term.  Yeah.  Great term.  So, we signed the new deal.  The press release went out yesterday, which proves a lot of people wrong, because everyone  thought they had the inside scoop.  They're getting rid of them.  Bubba loves buns and the rest of these...  Bubba knew.  He said, that's it, we're done.  We're not re-signing.  Right.  But anyway, I go on one of our, quote, fan sites for the first time in a while, and  it says, Opie and Anthony extend their deal with CBS.  I'm like, oh, this seems quite nice.  Let me see what the guys are talking about, right? 
[01:39:30]  Harmless?  The first post is like, oh, this explains why the show sucked the last two days.  I'm like, all right.  Well, goodbye.  Goodbye.  What the hell is that on me?  What?  Well, it's a fan site, and you would think they would take the opportunity to maybe just  be a bit more positive about us actually signing for another year, but even that, they use  it for an opportunity to trash us.  And why would that have anything to do with the show sucking?  The fact that we sign, why would that have anything to do with the show sucking? 
[01:40:00]  The guy that wrote that works at a mattress factory.  Of course he does.  Puts in 200 hours a week, and he's just jealous and miserable, and his wife's fat.  Ticking department.  Kids got polio.  He's an iron lung.  Can't hug him.  You're hugging this big, cold piece of steel.  I love you, son.  Just wrapped around this big submarine that your kid lives in.  What did you say it looked like?  We got a picture.  It's a whole, what, room filled with iron lungs. 
[01:40:30]  We're going to put it up on onaradio.com later, but.  Yeah.  It looks like the Home Depot when you're going to buy grills.  Right this way.  Let me show you to the.  Oh, yeah.  Look at it.  You know how many burgers you fit on this one?  Look at those tongs hanging off it and spatulas.  It's beautiful.  You're feeding your whole family there.  Bring them all over.  It's a hundred gas grills.  Iron lung.  Anyway.  Look at those.  You had to be sick.  That's scary.  But I just thought it was ridiculous that.  Built from a converted B-17 plant. 
[01:41:00]  They all look like plane parts that they just slapped together.  Like engines.  Put them in there.  Hollow engines or something.  The shelling of an engine.  I don't know.  But I thought that would be, oh, cool, nice.  And they took the opportunity to trash us.  And you wonder why we don't look at you as a fan site anymore.  How do you go from, oh, they signed for another year.  Well, that explains why they sucked the last two days.  Thanks.  How did the two have anything to do with each other?  And a lot of people said the last two days were great radio. 
[01:41:30]  So go after yourself.  Let's say hi to Jolene in Connecticut.  Jolene.  Hi.  I have stupid ancestor stories.  I figured I should have died about 20 years ago with the stuff my parents did to me.  Every summer we would go to Canada to visit my mother's relatives.  And on the way, it was the highlight of the trip, we would stop at some asbestos pits.  My brother and I would get out, play on the pits, play with the asbestos, and bring it home.  Oh, again, that's good. 
[01:42:00]  I swear to God, my father, too, worked in a factory.  He used to bring home cups of mercury for my brother and I to play with.  Mercury was a toy.  Yes.  And I barely remember that when I was a kid.  You could buy it in the store.  You'd buy mercury in a little bottle.  And you could pour it out in your hand.  And you kind of, ooh, look at that.  It goes around.  Yeah, it was fun.  Yeah.  I did it.  It makes me freaked out to this day.  Yeah, you would, like, try to keep it in your hand, like, whoa.  Yeah, you'd play with mercury.  And then they did one where they made a game, like, they'd put it in a plastic maze, a little dot of mercury. 
[01:42:30]  And you'd have to whip it around the little maze.  But, you know, you break it open.  Yeah, my dad used to tell us that me and my brother, if we broke the Etch-A-Sketches, we should eat the silver stuff.  It's good for us.  It's good for you.  Right.  God only knows what the hell that was.  Mercury, bro.  Yeah.  Mercury, a little lead.  If you bring a thermometer to school now, they call in the hazmat teams and evacuate to school.  Seriously.  That's really true.  Really?  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Well, so you were exposed to asbestos and mercury. 
[01:43:00]  So it's nice knowing you, honey.  You're going to wake up with a big lump.  You've got about two or three years left.  Enjoy.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to die of cancer.  It's just a matter of when.  She doesn't realize it, but I'm dead serious.  Yeah, really.  All right.  Thank you.  Brothers Patrick Swayze used to go play.  Bye.  Bye.  Fast Freddy writes, oh, just stay away from the boards.  Quite honestly, I do for the most part.  I mean, my board viewing is way, way down, unfortunately. 
[01:43:30]  And I used to be a huge fan of all those websites, but it just got completely ridiculous.  I think Ant explained it one day.  They all start off with good intentions, and then it just becomes something.  It mutates.  It mutates into something that has nothing to do with the original message board.  It's really an experiment in society, because it's a small society.  They come together.  They're unified by a common thing or goal or whatever it is, which was the show. 
[01:44:00]  And then usually they split up into factions, because people will like people more than  others.  And once that happens, that's when you start getting the bickering within the community.  And then they start going after what the original board was originally meant for, which is the  show.  Right.  It happens.  It's really too bad.  And it happens with all the message boards, and then new ones pop up, and they start off  nice.  Yeah.  And they go, I know how this is going to end. 
[01:44:30]  Like right now, there's a newbie board.  It's radiogoldfans.com.  They're doing good so far.  But, you know.  You know how that's gone.  A year or two down the road, they'll be in the same position as all the boards that came  before them.  Right.  It just is what happens.  It just happens.  I haven't seen one that hasn't really done that to some extent.  Kevin in Connecticut.  And know who suffers.  There's a lot of really true fans that are still part of these message boards.  But it's like you're buried in all the nonsense that happens on a daily basis. 
[01:45:00]  You can still get a few good threads going and posts that are fun, things like that.  But to sort through the crap and the haters, eh, why bother?  Kevin in Connecticut, what's up, buddy?  Busy.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  A regular to the show.  How are you, buddy?  Good.  How many days did they test that thalidomide drug for morning sickness?  Seven, eight.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's a beauty.  A little thalidomide.  Babies with little claws for arms and stuff?  Yeah, they had the little tiny arms. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, that was made for like, I think if you were at risk for miscarriage.  They would give women thalidomide and have them just lay down on their backs for a while.  Started in London.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just read an article like a week ago.  I can't remember.  Little flipper hands, yes, don't you know?  Don't worry, he can't brush his teeth, but it doesn't matter.  He's English.  Oh.  You're knitting your kid of sweater.  Chop the sleeves off that.  Save some yarn.  We've got a guy that works in the other building when we go to the other place, and he gets 
[01:46:00]  in the elevator almost every morning with us.  He's got a flipper arm.  Oh, yeah, a flipper arm guy.  Oh, really?  And he wears a watch, and I'm thinking to myself, why would you-  No, he doesn't.  Why would you bring attention to the flipper arm with a watch?  What he should do is put-  We all have phones with the time on it.  You don't need a watch.  What?  What he should do is he should put one of those green elastics around it, like a lobster.  You know when you buy lobsters, and they have a little peg in there?  Put the little band around it.  Just as a joke, you know?  That's so lobsters don't tear each other apart, I was told. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, they'll kill each other in there.  Yeah, they'll yank each other's claws.  Not so much to get the cook.  I think he's got the advantage.  The upper hand.  Ha ha, opposable thumb.  Go screw.  Put a pen in that claw, like Bob Dole.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, guys.  You had to keep with the stupid ancestors a bit.  You know, all the way up until probably the mid to late 1800s,  they used to drill a hole into people's heads if they had schizophrenia or multiple personalities 
[01:47:00]  to let the evil demons out.  Evil demons.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Yeah.  I had a friend in high school.  One more.  Oh, go ahead.  Oh, no, sorry.  One more.  Yeah, back also in early 1902, they used to sell heroin in a bottle with, like, pill form  right next to aspirin, and they used to say if it was, if aspirin was too abrasive on  your stomach or if it was causing ulcers, buy heroin.  They have actual, like, they have actual, like, drugstore posters that you could probably 
[01:47:30]  find that said, like, just heroin, like, in big, bold letters.  So, yeah.  Really?  They really had no idea what they were doing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's true.  All right, guys.  Very nice.  All right.  And I think that's actually good.  Yeah.  I forgot that we did a bit last time Nick was here that did very, very well, and we're  in the same position today.  Another slow news day, Nick.  It really is another slow news day.  We're bored with the presidential race.  I don't know.  Yeah, well, nothing really new. 
[01:48:00]  Bayer, aspirin, let me see, pharmaceutical products, aspirin, and heroin.  Yeah, look at that.  Up on EROC's screen.  The aspirin substitute.  It's hard to read.  It says heroin.  Oh, that's hilarious.  The sedative for...  A sedative.  For cough, it looks like, right?  Yeah.  For coughs.  That's good.  You will have a call for them.  You will have a call for them.  Order supply from your...  From your what?  Is there a number?  Yeah, no kidding. 
[01:48:30]  40 Stone Street.  Stone Street.  I swear to God, they're located on Stone Street here in New York.  This is selling...  If that street even exists anymore.  Huh?  Yeah, where was that?  Five points?  Yeah.  All right.  Mom, you going to Rite Aid?  Yeah.  Can you score me some heroin?  Pick me up a guitar on the way home.  I'll write a...  At the drugstore, you could score heroin.  When did that become illegal?  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  What happened?  Nuts.  Well, it is a slow news day, obviously.  And Danny puts a bit together every once in a while.  Just slow news day stories.  Mm-hmm.  This is what the news does.  Because they're faced with a similar dilemma.  Right.  They can't just sit and BS about shoe store x-ray foot things.  Well, when you do like a five-hour radio show every day, some days it's really easy.  Yeah.  It just takes on a life of its own. 
[01:49:30]  Other days, you're struggling a little bit.  So you come up with little things like you throw a topic out there like we did.  Sure.  Right?  Well, the news, they do the same thing.  You know, their whole job is to report the news.  And if you don't have the big stories, you've got to fill it up with something, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he anassed his hair.  The guy's in his late 80s, and he's going to pitch black hair.  Stupid.  Who are you kidding?  Then throw it to Sam Champion.  So bend over and catch.  So we got some slow news stories that the news is all over today. 
[01:50:00]  A new report has added scientific weight to the old saying that an apple a day keeps the doctor away.  The review of 10 years of research has found apples can reduce...  10 years.  They researched this.  Why is it always English, these 10 slow news?  Wasabi.  The power of wasabi.  Used on sushi.  Sushi.  Forgot about that.  A 10-year study of the apple. 
[01:50:30]  Sushi.  Sushi.  10 years of research has found apples can reduce the risk of serious illnesses, including heart disease, some cancers, and type 2 diabetes.  I'm thinking...  It took...  Diabetes.  It took them 10 years to say that eating fruit makes you healthier.  Yeah.  I mean, that's...  That's wonderful.  Again, I got to wonder if it's the apple itself or the fact that people that do eat apples probably eat...  Other fruit? 
[01:51:00]  ...better...  Oh, they eat better than that.  ...than people that are just eating crap all day.  I love apples.  I hope it's true.  Yeah, see?  There you go.  Yeah, but then...  You eat crap also?  I was going to say, after I have my...  Like, last night, I did.  I ate an apple and a pear, and then I had, like, 14 Reese's Cups.  Hit the sack.  Got more sugar me than, you know, BB King.  Laying on my bed, jonesing.  Watching hockey and grinding my teeth.  You know what?  It would take us less than a minute to find one listener that loves apples, too, Nick, and has some kind of horrific cancer. 
[01:51:30]  That's right.  That's exactly right.  Yeah, I eat apples every day now.  I got a tune of the size of one.  Coincidentally.  I got a Brayburn on my ass.  Macintosh at the base of your skull.  Dye, Bajis.  I think as time goes on, we all learn the benefits of eating fresh fruit and vegetables. 
[01:52:00]  Researchers say apples also have a high concentration of antioxidants.  The report was prepared for the Australian Fruit and Vegetable Coalition.  What are they, behind in England on this stuff?  An apple a day.  I heard it in first grade, stupid.  Yeah, now they're going to discover toothpaste.  Unfortunately, they bite into an apple and leave eight of their teeth in it.  Let's say hi to Derek.  I'm long out.  I'm going backwards a little bit because he's a doctor and he knows about iron lungs.  Derek.  Hey, guys. 
[01:52:30]  How are you doing?  Hey, man.  Good.  The iron lung wasn't just for polio.  It was the first respirator.  They don't have breathing machines back then.  So anybody who couldn't breathe on their own, instead of putting a tube down their throat,  they used to have to put them in that machine.  See that?  Wow.  Could you get one with a Yankees logo on it?  Back in the 50s?  Oh, this guy, Dave, down there on line 10.  Yeah.  I was approached with this.  Hold on one second, though, because we've got a guy calling Collect from prison.  We love these calls.  Michael.  Hey, what's up, Bo? 
[01:53:00]  Bayside State Prison.  What's up?  Not much, pal.  My team.  You get, you're calling us Collect?  Yes, I am.  What's your deal, man?  Well, I guess you could say that I had a bad case of the drunks, and I ended up going into  the wrong house when I was hammered.  Oh, no.  So you're drunk, you're going to the wrong house, and you got arrested?  Yes, I did.  And you're in prison for that?  Yes, I am.  Did you kill someone in there?  Did you smother a baby?  What did you do?  Well, it was, you know, it was my mom's next-door neighbor's house. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  And what happened was, is that I went in, and when I realized I was in the wrong house,  I tried to leave.  Dude was there with his family, you know?  So what he did was, he football tackled me as I tried to leave, started beating the crap  out of me.  Yeah.  So I was so drunk, you know, I got tired of him wailing on me, so I started wailing on  him back.  Oh, okay.  Tell us the truth.  Because it was the third time that happened that week, though.  Right. 
[01:54:00]  You're the other guys yelling at that.  How long did you get?  Yeah, you can, right?  I got five years, 11 months, 14 days.  What the hell?  Wait, you're leaving something out.  Dude, something.  What are your priors?  You got to have priors.  No.  No priors.  First time, you're drunk, you accidentally go into someone's house and get in a fight,  and you get five years?  Five years, 11 months, 14 days.  Did you kill the guy?  Yeah, you must have hurt the guy.  No.  No.  And the thing is, right, they said that I broke his toe, but in my discovery, they asked 
[01:54:30]  him, the police report asked him, was there any injuries?  And he's like, no.  We were just shaken up because he came in the house.  Moe, Larry, and Curly were his lawyers.  Yeah, really?  What?  That's a little excessive.  Well, see, they got this 85% law over here.  They hit me with second-degree burglary.  I said, how is it burglary?  I said, I went in the house.  I didn't even take nothing.  I wasn't even going in there.  Burglary is pretty much just, you know.  Breaking an address?  Yeah.  Once you're in the house, you're a burglar. 
[01:55:00]  And the thing is, is that who keeps their doors unlocked?  See, that's why, because my mother knows that...  I think I was putting the blame on them.  Yeah.  He's all hammered.  Hey, lock your door next time, idiot.  Wait, he was going to say something.  So, did your mom keep her door unlocked?  Well, yeah, because my mom knows that when I go see shows and stuff, that I do happen  to hit the bottle a lot.  So...  So the pandemonium out behind him. 
[01:55:30]  So, instead of me banging on her door at 2 o'clock in the morning, I just walk in  and pass out on the couch.  So, you know.  See, now, if you wandered into Anthony's house...  Yeah, that could be a problem.  Count your blessings, sir.  You're dead meat.  Yeah, count your blessings.  You just got a little beating in five years of your life taken away.  Well, look.  Six years.  You know, the beating was no big deal for me.  And I'm like, look, you know, I apologize.  I even tried to apologize to the guy. 
[01:56:00]  You know, my mother could have actually went to him.  Listen, he's not from here.  I can understand how he went to the show and everything else.  We have the same color door.  And, I mean, because, like, where I live in California, all the houses don't look the  same.  Where my mother lives here in New Jersey, all the houses look the same.  She lives on one of those, like, suburban blocks, you know?  So, you know.  And even my lawyer's like, well, if you remember the name of the bartender, I'm like, it's a 
[01:56:30]  dude.  Who the hell remembers the name of a dude?  It was a chick.  Good point.  Right.  I'm like, if it was a chick, I'd probably be able to tell you her name.  But it was a dude.  Right.  Wow.  But they didn't give you, they didn't, like, see if you were drinking when they arrested  you?  Well, they said that Mr. Duke was very, very intoxicated.  They, like, my numbers was, like, 0.073, 0.074.  That's not that bad. 
[01:57:00]  That's not bad.  You know?  I don't know.  It sounds like you really got a raw deal.  You're leaving something out.  Well, see, I, and this is what's funny, because, um.  Nothing's funny about this.  I mean, well, I got 25 months left to do.  That's what I'm down to.  I've already been locked up just about four years.  Jeez.  You've done four years already?  That doesn't make any sense.  Yeah, we gotta, just gotta.  How'd you not get, like, good time?  You know, it's great.  If you want to see my picture, if you go to njdoc.com, and look under my name, you'll 
[01:57:30]  actually, you'll see what I'm in jail for.  All right.  We'll, uh, we'll go there.  And, um, like, uh, my number, my, uh, SBI number is 383-345 with a C.  With a C.  383-345 with a C.  383 what?  3-4-5.  Right?  All right.  And a C right after it.  Let's see.  God.  What's the craziest thing that happened to you in prison? 
[01:58:00]  Well, I just did nine months, nine and a half months for ad's sake, for, uh, breaking a  guy's kneecap.  Oh, this guy's trouble.  Yeah.  Why'd you break his kneecap?  Walked into a cell?  Wrong cell?  No, what happened was is that somebody tried to beat him on some dope.  Hmm.  And, uh, he thought that he was gonna come to me and collect.  And...  What gave him that idea?  Well, it was like this, right?  What happened was, he comes to my cell, he's like, yo, Cali, I'm like, what's up? 
[01:58:30]  He's like, come to my cell real quick.  So I'm like, all right.  So, he's like, yo, I got eight bags of dope.  I said, how much you want for it?  He's like, 200.  I said, hold on a second.  Let me go get my man.  So, I went and go got my boy.  I'm like, yo, tell me if you think it's worth it.  And, so he came up, he looked, he's like, yeah.  So I'm like, look, I'll send that 100, you send that 100.  Split it 50-50, four bags apiece.  In prison. 
[01:59:00]  In prison.  Yeah, this is prison, by the way.  Sounds like a concert.  Yeah.  So, so what happens is, I'm wrecked.  I'm wrecked off a bag and a half.  I mean, I am, I'm gone.  The next morning comes, he's like, I didn't get high.  I'm like, bro, I got high off a bag and a half.  You had four bags.  How did you not get high?  I'm like, I still got two and a half bags left.  So, he's like, look, I'm telling him he's beat.  I didn't get high.  I'm not paying him.  It's Jay.  I said, well, that's on you. 
[01:59:30]  Jay and Silent Bob.  Yeah, we're looking at your picture.  You look like Jay.  We just put your picture up, Mike.  I don't believe a word you said.  Why are you smiling so much?  Yeah, in your prison photo, you're smiling.  Oh, look, I just had that picture taken when I came here to Bayside,  because I was just at Rollway at SAG.  Wow.  Where'd you get locked up originally?  In Monmouth County.  So, what happened was my wife, my soon-to-be ex-wife, as a matter of fact,  she told me that she wanted me smiling in my picture.  So, I did that for her, for the internet picture. 
[02:00:00]  Like, my ID, I'm not smiling.  It was only for the internet.  And why are you going to get a divorce?  Oh, well, because I believe that infidelity is a no-no.  Ah, she wasn't willing to wait, huh?  Well, she did four years with me, you know.  I can't be mad at that.  But, you know, she's got my daughter and everything.  And, you know, I can't do it anymore, you know.  I just can't do it anymore, because I can't be stressing about that.  The big question.  So, you're doing over five years. 
[02:00:30]  Yep.  What concert were you at?  That's all I need to know.  I was at the Skid Row.  I was seeing Skid Row.  Oh, my God.  What?  Skid Row.  The one without Sebastian.  Yeah, the one without Sebastian.  You got locked up for five years after seeing Skid Row without Sebastian Bach?  Wow.  You deserve every day.  I would have been rather the great white concert in Rhode Island.  Well, see, the thing is, is that when I heard that Skid Row was in the area, I was thinking, like, I thought they broke up. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, well, they kind of did.  And then, well, when I went there, you know, I'm like, wow, this must be like a reunion type thing.  Right.  But then I found out that the dude was from Dallas, Texas, because, like, they introduced him.  See, that's what pissed this guy off that led to five-plus years in jail.  He goes to the show thinking he's going to see Sebastian Bach.  Well, that ain't nothing.  And it's some dude replacing Sebastian Bach, and they're still using the name Skid Row.  Right.  You know?  You're lucky you didn't kill somebody. 
[02:01:30]  That explains his hairdo, at least.  Right.  Well, see, this is the funny thing, is that, you know, they gave me a 7 with 85.  That was my total time, 7 years with 85 under the NERA Act.  And not only do I have to do 5 years, 11 months, 14 days in prison, they're giving me a mandatory 3 years parole afterwards.  Oh, my God.  So that's like 9 years when the maximum amount of time that they could give me is 7 years.  Wow.  Do you get to listen to the radio show in prison? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, well, see, you guys used to, I don't know if you guys are, like, I'm waiting to get my new radio, but I know that you guys used to be on WYSP.  Right, right.  And so I don't know if you, because, like, when I went back up north, because right now I'm in South Jersey.  So I know that when I went back up the Rallway, I was getting you guys to show every day.  That's creepy that guys in prison are listening to this.  Well, actually.  That's cool.  Because, you know.  Big fan, though. 
[02:02:30]  You know, we need this guy out there, you know.  You know, I mean, like, I feel like you guys, you guys are going to get paid, you know.  You guys are getting paid.  You guys are going to definitely get paid.  Because, like, because we have TVs in ourselves.  Sounds like a threat.  Oh, boy.  No, no, like.  When the Muslims get to you, what's going on?  Getting paid.  Like, with the news and everything, you know, we got TVs in ourselves.  Is this Dan Mason?  Right.  So, like, when me and my boy heard about it, we're like, yo, they're going to get paid.  What does that mean, sir? 
[02:03:00]  Are we all right?  Do I have to worry?  No, no, like, with the whole court situation with you guys and the stupid-ass satellite radio thingy.  Oh, I'm a little confused.  The merger?  The merger and stuff?  I don't know.  No, I thought that they censored you for something, and you paid for the, like, that's why you went to satellite radio, was so you wouldn't be censored.  And then they tried censoring something that you said.  Oh, yeah, that goes back about a year.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got suspended for about, I forgot, 30 days or something? 
[02:03:30]  See?  Yeah, right on.  And I'm done with the power, you know.  All right.  I think that you guys are going to get paid.  What gang are you with?  I'm not.  I'm neutral.  You didn't go with the Aryan Nation?  You didn't have to do any of that.  He's an independent.  He's running as an independent.  You didn't have to do any of that man-on-man action, did you?  No.  No man-on-man action?  No.  Actually, that don't even really happen here.  No, of course it doesn't.  It's every other prison except the one you're calling from. 
[02:04:00]  No, like, actually, I've been, this, this is the, this is the third prison I've been to.  They keep transferring you around for.  Well, what happened was I was originally doing time in a prison called Southwood State Prison.  And the place is huge.  I mean, it's huge.  There's like 4,000 inmates there.  But what happened was when I got into a fight, they put me in a seg, which is lock-up.  Lock-up was up in Raleway, Raleway, New Jersey. 
[02:04:30]  So when I got done, like, I just did nine and a half months lock-up time.  That was 24 hours a day, seven days a week I was locked up for nine and a half months.  This guy.  That's insane.  And then they transferred me down here to where I'm at now.  All right.  Listen, Michael, we can talk to you all day, but we're really late for a break, so.  Right.  All right.  Hang in there and I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  Hey, it was beautiful out yesterday.  Yeah.  I got to tell you.  I was outside.  Walking around.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  In the yard.  On the yard.  No way.  You know what's great about days like that, though?  You walk around the city, the girls are dressed so scantily.  Yeah.  It's really hot.  I'll be out there soon enough.  I'll show you a steak.  I ate it outside.  Yeah.  All right, Michael.  All right.  Take it easy, Mike.  All right, you fellas.  Let me just say this.  Poor bastard.  You deserve five years if you're a Skid Row fan.  No kidding.  Well, you know, Skid Row without Sebastian Bach.  Even with him, I wasn't jumping out of my socks.  Right, right. 
[02:05:30]  He did something else.  Come on.  Of course he did.  He actually stumbled on a lady who was in, you know, that house.  Yeah.  Something fell on top of her.  Something might have slipped.  Dropped a seed somewhere.  He's got over five years and three years probation after that.  What did he do?  I know.  Everyone's innocent here at Shawshank.  Now I need to call it Case Stern, representative.  Right.  Opie and Anthony.  Getting ready to wrap up another week of fine and interesting radio.  I want to thank Nick DiPaolo for stopping by today. 
[02:06:00]  We were just discussing that guy that just called from prison, and we all believe that  he's not telling the whole truth.  We have an expert in the studio.  What can you say about that phone call there, Mikey?  I'm not a detective, but if I was a detective.  You're the TMZ kid, though.  I know that.  He's full of crap.  He's full of crap?  I think it's a little more than what he was just saying.  He made it sound like he's drunk.  He enters a house.  It's a mistake because he's drunk, and all the doors look the same. 
[02:06:30]  He was leaving, and the homeowner tackled him, started punching him, and since he was  being punched so badly, he started fighting back.  I'm going to say he defended himself a little too much.  Yeah.  You think the homeowner grabs him.  This guy kind of knows maybe a little more than the homeowner does about kicking ass and  really starts pounding on the homeowner.  Yeah, definitely.  Because the charge is either armed or an assault.  That's like an added-on charge.  Uh-huh. 
[02:07:00]  When I was reading the bio, his nice bio.  His bio.  Got a good bio?  Yes.  He got the mandatory minimum, so that means if you get five to ten, you got to definitely  do the five?  Yeah, you automatically have to do the minimum.  Right, right.  So I guess it was five.  And then three years probation when he gets out, so.  When you break it down and the guy's in someone else's house beating the crap out of the  homeowner, I guess the circumstance doesn't matter as much as what transpired.  Yeah, once he enters the house, it's, you know.  Yeah, all bets are off. 
[02:07:30]  It's an automatic Berg charge already.  He's not supposed to be there.  He wasn't invited in.  And then you get the assault on top of him.  But can't the guy that owns the house, like, drop that charge if he realizes that it was  a, you know, mistake?  Yeah, but like I said, he probably beat the bejesus there.  Right, right.  And then you're not dropping any charges at that point.  Then listen to a story about being bounced around from prison to prison.  Yeah.  And Raleway, where he was, they did the nine months, kind of like, sound like, you know,  solitary.  Yeah.  Raleway's, you know, is a happening joint.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, little white Mikey Duke doesn't go to Raleway. 
[02:08:00]  So you think there was a little problem, he's been a problem at the other institution?  I don't know.  He's buying dope in jail.  Why do you tackle a guy that's leaving your house, too?  Yeah, that's another thing.  Hey, I was leaving.  Yeah, and the guy tackled him.  Hey, don't go.  Did you stay right there?  I haven't seen my wife yet.  That's true.  Burgle is leaving your house, and you tackle him?  Yeah, you get back here.  Start doing some of that burgling.  Don't just come in here and walk around. 
[02:08:30]  Do something.  Yeah, you're a burglar.  Why don't you burgle?  Smack my wife.  She deserves it.  Well, I'm sure that guy will be calling back.  Those pork chops.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They look really good.  Oh, my God.  I'm starving right now.  Hey, Dirk put together another Above Radio promo, Ant.  I put my foot in my mouth this week there, Nick.  We had a very, very intelligent discussion with Dr. Kaku about the universe.  A physicist, yeah.  And then we had Jesse Ventura on, and we went at it with him. 
[02:09:00]  Mostly Jimmy and Anthony went at it.  It was the 9-11 thing.  Yeah, I heard that.  And I was trying to explain to E-Rock that this show is above radio, meaning a lot of  these guys, like Jesse Ventura, they come in and they think they could slap the host  around because radio guys in general are just kind of dweeby guys that don't really know  much about anything.  And I was trying to explain that to E-Rock, that we're above radio, like we're better  than most.  Absolutely.  And more intelligent than most.  You like basic cable.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  And I'm not going to live that down anytime soon because now they've taken that Above Radio  thing.  Yeah.  And they've made a little promo series.  Oh, cool.  Here's the latest one from Terry.  All right.  I really believe this show is way above radio.  Put it on the table.  Someone take the underwear.  Take the underwear.  This is really.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It's almost like.  It's like the underpants were dyed brown.  And those used to be white.  Way above other radio shows.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tippi Tom's Underpants Mustache. 
[02:10:00]  Boy, that's bad news.  All right.  I think we're ready here.  Oh, no way.  No way.  Oh, f**k.  Oh, f**k.  Enjoy your hepatitis.  Pat f**k nothing.  Yeah.  We're above radio.  Well, above radio.  We sure are. 
[02:10:30]  I thought I was listening to McNeil-Lair report.  Yeah.  That's how high above radio we are.  And that video, we explained it earlier in the show if you're just tuning in.  But Homeless Underwear Mustache.  Put that in the search on YouTube and you're going to get a nice video to check out and spread to your friends.  Homeless Underwear Mustache.  Homeless Underwear Mustache.  We should have to hear those three words together.  We should call the show the f**k-tuation room.  The video is just terrific. 
[02:11:00]  It's unbelievable.  It's a good name for a band, actually.  Homeless Underwear Mustache.  Yeah.  It would have to be a punk band, don't you think?  Absolutely.  Oh, no love ballads on that one.  Let's squeeze one more in here.  It's a slow news day.  We do this bit when Nick comes in from time to time.  And, well, this is a great story for a slow news day.  It's almost like it's my fault as a slow news every time I come in.  Gee, thanks, Nick.  Can't you bring in some stories next time?  I'll hit somebody and take off on the way in here.  And do something.  Yeah.  Break into someone's house and beat them up.  Tell them you were drunk.  With its calming tone and flexible appeal, the ancient exercise of yoga has been practiced 
[02:11:30]  by humans for centuries.  Oh, boy.  But a class in Bellevue wants to prove the benefits of yoga don't just apply to those with two feet.  Welcome to Yoga with Your Dog.  All right.  I thought you said yogurt with your dog because this is a Korean broadcast.  Oh.  I thought it was going to be something where people, legless people, did yoga. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, no.  See, I didn't think it was going to be without two feet, but they meant two more feet, four feet.  As soon as they said yoga with your dog, I looked at Nick and it looked like he was having  an aneurysm right in front of my eyes.  Again, the world's ears perk up and just go, oh, this stupid country again.  Right.  Oh, America.  Right.  With their yoga for their dogs.  I was watching American Idol gives back or whatever the, you know, and they were showing  all these starving kids in Africa and how they live and stuff.  And I was laughing so hard. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's hysterical.  And then these people in America, they go, well, why does the rest of the world hate  us?  Like, people are spending money to do yoga with their dog.  Yoga with their dog.  Which, you know, hey, we're a rich nation.  We should be able to do whatever the hell we want.  Oh, exactly.  But don't, but don't try to say why does the rest of the world hate us?  It's obvious why they hate us.  I'm not saying it's wrong that we do what we do because we have a lot more money. 
[02:13:00]  I watched, I watched a show the other night and cause I thought it was kind of going to,  and this is awful.  I know, but what am I going to tell you?  This is how I am.  I thought it was going to be a little sexy.  You ever watch a show like on PBS or something and think, eh, this might be a little like titillating.  On PBS?  Yes, no, maybe.  One of those like shows on Tahiti where you might see some topless little Tahitians running  around, like something like that.  So this was a documentary on the epidemic of rape in the Congo. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, I started to watch it.  Did you start watching that?  Yeah.  Then I realized I don't care about those people.  And that's exactly where I ended up.  I turned it on and I'm hoping for maybe a little titillating rape fantasy story or something  like that.  Me too.  And it just turned out to be this awful story of this war-torn hellhole with women that  not really that hot to look at.  They usually have their teeth bashed in and just awful. 
[02:14:00]  And just the savagery that is going on there with these little civil wars that are going  on.  People hacking each other apart with machetes, mutilating the women after they're done raping  them.  Same stuff that's going on in East Brooklyn.  Right.  Just like East Brooklyn.  Bed-Stuy.  So did you start crying or you changed the tone?  No, no.  I didn't cry.  I got bored.  That was a joke.  I know.  You and I must have went through the same.  I went, hmm.  Maybe there'll be a little something here. 
[02:14:30]  A little fantasy material.  You're like, ah, this is a letdown.  Yeah.  So I was just like, ah.  And the first two bras looked like Nell Carter crying in a tent.  I'm like, oh.  That was it.  Even if I see her boob, I've seen it before in National Geographic.  Did you see the one woman with that one huge tooth?  Looked like a candy corn.  And that was it.  The tooth had hair on it.  Oh, it was horrid.  So I was like, no, this isn't getting sexy.  One of those, a tooth that was supposed to be another body part.  But it's grown out of your, grew into a tooth. 
[02:15:00]  It's grown out of your elbow.  So yoga with dogs.  Let's squeeze this in before we got to get two feet.  Welcome to yoga with your dog.  In a place known more for pets than position, doggy yoga is putting a new twist on this old exercise.  I just started to allow my dogs in my yoga room at home with me on my yoga mat.  And I just started working them into some of the poses.  And beginning to connect with your breath.  Yeah, this is the peanut butter pose. 
[02:15:30]  Peanut butter yoga.  Right.  All right.  I'm going to do the full lotus position.  Downward facing pig.  And you just do the position that's named after you.  Yeah, downward facing mommy.  Downward facing mommy.  To connect with your breath and with your dog, lift the fingertips up.  It may look a little odd, but Brenda believes the dog really do get something out of it.  They, of course, get some of the health benefits. 
[02:16:00]  We incorporate some massage into the yoga practice for them.  For them.  They don't want to be massaged.  They want a bone.  Yoga is about stretching.  Yeah.  Dogs don't need to stretch.  Your dog sees a cargo bar.  He runs off the porch.  Has he ever pulled a hamstring?  Comes back.  Never.  One paw on his hip.  Oh, Jesus.  What did I do?  I'm getting too old for this crap.  Never seen a dog with an ice pack on his back of his leg.  And from dead asleep to full bolting run. 
[02:16:30]  Right.  And you know who said that?  Coach Lou Holtz said that.  He had like three running backs route with hamstrings.  And the trainer tried to blame Lou Holtz.  He goes, your players aren't stretching enough.  He goes, man, I had a dog that used to sit on the porch.  A car go by and get up and chase.  Never pulled a hammy.  That's so true.  Every dog is ripped.  They got all their muscles in the right place.  They don't need stretching.  They don't need breathing.  They don't need yoga.  That's Travis's fat little dog. 
[02:17:00]  Your dog's getting fat.  Disgusting.  Travis.  Your stupid little French frigging fairy dog.  It's getting too fat.  A French bulldog or something like that?  Yeah, he's got a French bulldog.  Why?  You're spoiling it.  No, I'm not.  Because I've seen pictures on, of course, any site that you have anything to do with is  flooded with pictures of your stupid dog, Dexter.  I'm glad you're looking at my dog.  And it's getting a little chubby.  No, he's actually skinny compared to all the other.  No, it's not. 
[02:17:30]  Don't you talk about my dog.  Ew.  He's so attached to this thing.  I think we could actually do something if Anthony attacked you.  Don't you.  Hey, now, buster.  Look at you.  Yes, I have my star on.  All right, listen.  We've got to get to the rest of the story.  I'm a sheriff.  We're supposed to be off the radio.  Yes, this is present.  Yeah, dog stinks.  I hope it dies.  Yoga practice for them.  Now, we're going to do some stretches for them as well.  I'll stretch your neck, you dummy.  Incorporate them into many of the poses.  It may not be what yoga founders had in mind, but if doggy yoga catches on, contorting with 
[02:18:00]  your canine may become a four-legged step to enlightenment.  If your dog watched that story and wants to go to the yoga class, we certainly encourage  your dog to go.  Don't let your dog drive, though.  Very dangerous.  Drive your dog to the yoga class.  Next one is on Sunday.  They shouldn't be allowed to be called the news anymore.  No.  He was really trying to be funny, wasn't he?  Dog can lick himself.  He's well-stretched.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, the second you can do that, you don't need yoga anymore.  Your dog can do it.  Exactly.  I don't know if I could say that.  Oh.  All right, Nick, it's to you.  You get the last 20 seconds.  What are we promoting?  Nick DiPaolo did a great job today.  NickDip.com.  I know that much.  NickDip.com.  And next Friday and Saturday night, there'll be a week from tonight and tomorrow night,  I'm going to be at the brand new opening of a club in Haskell, New Jersey.  It's called the Comedy Shop at 815.  Most nights.  Sorry.  And go to NickDip.com. 
[02:19:00]  Go on to my forum and cause havoc.  Yeah, you like that?  NickDip.com.  Very nice.  We're heading over to XM.  Am I going with you?  Sure.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Hell yeah.  Either that or we all go home.  Well, have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys Monday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM202.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony. 
[02:19:30]  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio out of any other medium have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Oh, great.  Screw sie, go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[02:20:00]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  All is...  Wardrobe?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  What are you doing in death? 
[02:20:30]  I've been hanging a lot with JFK.  He's the life of the party, let me tell you.  Why would he be the life of the party?  At the party, he's the one that goes around with the Doritos, and he fills his head with  salsa.  It's time for people to understand, these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I think we can get this done.  I see the wad of bills you got.  I know it's got a bunch.  I got some money on me. 
[02:21:00]  Welcome to XM Satellite Radio.  Chick fights rule, huh?  Chick fights rule.  That seems to be a big thing these days.  All I saw was the footage of those girls fighting and stuff.  What's the latest on that?  I don't know.  What did you just say?  I can't really hear the show too well.  Why?  What happened?  Well, I don't have headphones.  I'm sitting here, and I just don't have headphones.  You want mine, Anthony?  I just don't.  No, no, that's fine.  No, he doesn't want it.  I got ones that say Anthony on them. 
[02:21:30]  That way Tippi Tom doesn't use them.  And we put them back in the safe after Anthony's done.  Who's getting yelled at, E-Rock?  E-Rock's shaking his head.  What is Tippi Tom about?  Oh, there's yelling going on now, because I didn't have my headphones.  Wait, get them in here.  Maybe we can get someone to quit our show too.  Get in here!  Get in here!  All right, someone's going to pay.  What happened, E-Rock?  E-Rock, what happened?  Very annoyed, E-Rock.  Who's responsible?  I think it would be Mars. 
[02:22:00]  Mars?  Really?  The replays in the headphones are all done before we get here.  Uh-huh.  And that's usually what Mars is doing.  Oh, so he's shirking his responsibility.  I blame Artie's assistant.  Right.  That guy.  What a bastard.  When the mutiny happens, E-Rock, are you going to go for the big position, you think, or what?  He's going to be the one that gets fired.  Yeah, that's probably how it's going to work out, but I'll make a run for it.  Will you?  Will you be like the goof guy?  You know when a job opens up and it's a real high-position job and the people inside want to get first crack at it? 
[02:22:30]  So you have to interview all the people on the inside, and then you have to interview that one person that wants it,  that you know is just never going to get it.  It's like the goof guy.  Are you going to be that guy?  I hope not.  It was a rhetorical question.  I know the answer already.  Someone remind me to bring in the kiss-ass letter that E-Rock wrote me.  Oh, no. 
[02:23:00]  How did you not bring that in the second you received it?  I forgot.  No.  Get on top of that.  People know.  Make sure you fucking email me over the weekend.  You got it.  Look at that.  Instantly pulled out his iPhone and he's putting that note in.  Going through a lot of boxes, going through a lot of radio stuff, and I found this letter.  I'm like, wow, a letter.  Someone wrote me, and I'm reading this letter.  It's like, I forget all the stuff in it, but it's brutal.  Can you just please remember one thing?  He's kissing some serious ass.  It's an actual physical pen on paper letter?  It typed out.  He signed it. 
[02:23:30]  Because he was looking for a gig with the show.  Stuff like, I'll work 110%.  110%.  Well, he's got the 10 down, baby.  What else did you write, E-Rock?  You know.  I'm usually original.  I think there was something about working Christmas, I think, was in there, too.  Yeah.  He goes, I'll even work Christmas, whatever it takes.  He puts.  And then now that he got the gig, we can't even get him, you know, to get to work on time.  I'll give 110%, and I think outside the box. 
[02:24:00]  No, you don't.  You disapproved it by saying 110%.  Hey, by the way, to the people that are booing the fact that we decided to do another year on  regular radio, you just don't understand nothing.  No.  You don't understand at all.  We have no idea if we're going to make the cut when this merger hits.  So we got to keep everything fucking in the air.  All balls in the air for now.  Bulls.  You dopes.  Trust me.  We know what we're doing. 
[02:24:30]  Make the cut.  Of course you're going to make the cut.  Jesus Christ, you have to, guys.  With all of our buddies over there.  We've done nothing but bash over the past.  There was a rumor that we...  Ah, that's water under the bridge.  What was the latest?  It sure is.  We got spies over there.  A couple.  Not many.  And there was a rumor that we got fired or we were going to be let go or something.  And they were actually close to throwing a party over there.  Celebrating our demise.  Our demise.  So, boy.  So, whatever. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, stupid radio politics.  Money talks.  Bullshit walks.  That's what I've heard.  I remembered it when I first heard it.  All right.  So, chick fights.  Mm-hmm.  E-Rock's stupid.  Anthony's headphones.  Mm-hmm.  What else?  It's kind of a letdown being here today after that craziness yesterday.  Oh, man.  Thank God.  At least I could inhale.  Homeless underwear mustache.  Yeah, can I ask you, what did Tippi Tom touch?  Oh, we kept him back there.  Well, good.  Believe me.  Shouldn't there be crime tape around there?  Well, there should.  There should, because maybe someone could come in and explain what happened after we left yesterday, 
[02:25:30]  where one of these poor interns had to clean a skin mark off that couch from Tippi Tom.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Jesus.  Apparently, Tom came to a very fast halt on the couch.  Left that little, uh...  Yeah.  Can't you have that thing stained clean to some shit?  With acid.  What happened, Sam?  Well, we realized, we remember that Tippi Tom sat there for like an hour after you guys 
[02:26:00]  left.  Without his pants on.  Or his pants still down.  He couldn't be bothered.  With his headphones on and nothing going through him.  Yeah.  And then we tried to get him to leave, and he didn't want to take his headphones off because  he called them earmuffs and said he wanted to keep his ears warm, and it was 70 degrees  outside.  Earmuffs.  And then he finally got up, and we remembered that his pants had been down, and we had taken  his underwear, and there was a skid mark on the couch that was about a foot long.  Oh, wow.  Just like Talladega turned three. 
[02:26:30]  Nick's got the best references, man.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you got a picture of it?  We took pictures of it.  Oh, of course.  Wow, that really does.  You turn it sideways, and it is the Talladega stripe.  Let me see.  Is it really...  Do we have...  What the fuck?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  No, I know what it is.  It's shit.  Get out of here.  It's multicolored.  You got this in color?  Yeah.  What was he doing on the screen?  Oh, wow. 
[02:27:00]  I need to see this in color.  Yeah, put it on the big screen.  We need this...  Jesus Christ.  It looks like when the shuttle blew up.  It's just a...  Yes.  It's like a satellite shot of...  Right.  What was he doing, 110 when he sat down?  Different shades of brown and some white.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, there's a little white.  We had our intern, Brian, clean it up.  Right.  So...  How did it go there, Brian?  It was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  At first, I took some Lysol.  That didn't do the job.  So then I went for some rubbing alcohol.  That wasn't doing it either.  I was scrubbing, but it was basically just going deeper into the couch. 
[02:27:30]  Hey, Brian, how about Sunoco SU 2000?  It might be there, might have a match.  Should have given that a shot.  Poor Brian.  What do you think you were going to do when you interned for the Open Anthony show?  I had a feeling I might end up doing something like that, to tell you the truth.  I was a fan of the show, so...  All right, so...  He probably thought he had to lick it.  He was fucking...  He was really easy.  He was relieved when someone called him, and, oh, all I have to do is clean it up.  Oh, thank God.  I got off easy.  Could have been worse.  Keith was...  Me and Keith drove home yesterday.  Of course.  So he goes, you know what the best part is? 
[02:28:00]  I bring Tippy Tom in.  He does a great job.  And then I leave, and some poor intern has to deal with getting him out of there, cleaning  up his shit.  He wouldn't leave at all.  In order to actually get him to leave the building, we had to buy him a 40 and say he could  have it when he got out.  Oh, you look like a carrot on a stick with a horse.  Only the horse smells better.  Now, Sam, homeless underwear mustache.  Uh-huh.  That's what you put in YouTube to see the video. 
[02:28:30]  But you put up a bunch of Tippy Tom videos yesterday, right?  Well, yeah.  They're slowly making their way onto YouTube.  They're all on opianthony.com.  My favorite Tippy Tom video is, uh, Tippy Tom reacts to Sophie's Choice.  Oh, that is fantastic.  What the fuck?  Fill me in, fellas.  He is, uh...  I forgot about that.  You wouldn't see him as an emotional guy.  Someone that's, uh, touched so much by something.  Do we have that audio for the only thing?  He, he, uh, apparently loves the movie Sophie's Choice. 
[02:29:00]  Uh...  And what's that movie about?  Refresh My Memory?  That is a movie, it's, uh, about, um, uh, concentration camp.  Meryl Streep.  It has Meryl Streep in it.  Two kids.  She's got two kids.  And, of course, Sophie's Choice is...  It's a feel-good movie.  ...which kid she's gonna give up to the Nazis.  Just give one away.  She's gotta give one up.  And, uh, when the, uh, the daughter is taken away by the Nazis and, and the crying starts,  Tom just loses it.  Do we have that clip?  And he is crying and screaming for the poor child. 
[02:29:30]  And, and, uh, for some reason, I guess this goes a lot deeper than just the movie to him.  Yeah.  And perhaps there was Tippi Tom's dad's choice.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And, uh, we have the video of it, uh...  Oh, where's the audio?  Yeah, we got the audio.  Oh, I...  What if I'm gonna do, uh, Meryl Streep as she's holding her daughter?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Tell us.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
[02:30:00]  The Germans were wrong. 
[02:30:30]  He's going out on a limb there, isn't he?  And I'm German.  And I'm wrong.  I didn't do that.  I would never do that.  That was your people, though. 
[02:31:00]  Well, I was raised that way, but I'm not that way.  Tom, why are you so upset?  I don't get it.  You got so upset.  Once he has a swig of beer, he's fine.  It's wrong.  Why'd they take the little baby?  It's wrong.  What's wrong about that?  In those times, in those times, things were different, I guess. 
[02:31:30]  You ain't going to pull that shit now.  Why'd they take the baby, though?  The little baby got saved.  Oh, look.  Oh, no.  Look, here's the scene.  This is what follows you?  How about you guys rubbing it in?  Yes!  Oh, I know.  You guys are relentless.  We just want him to cry again.  This is terrible, baby.  That's wrong.  No!  He'd have a Mouser part in his face in a second. 
[02:32:00]  I'd go fight.  Yeah, sure you would.  Yeah?  You can't ride, I will.  It's a funny movie, right?  You laugh when you watch that movie?  It's funny.  Fucking Jimmy.  I like movies.  And like a switch.  What the fuck?  I like movies.  I like movies.  I just forgot everything that happened.  I'm a goldfish.  Please tell me that's not the skid mark.  That's the skid mark.  Oh, God damn it. 
[02:32:30]  Enjoy that omelet, dude.  Yeah, I was going to say.  We found the skid mark in color.  That looks like the face on Mars.  What the fuck?  It looks like an island in the Pacific.  Yeah, look at the blue water.  Yeah.  The cushions are blue.  That does.  It looks like an aerial photo of a lovely island.  Yeah, Marlon Brando, you're still on that.  After a brush fire.  An atoll out there in the Pacific.  Yeah.  Yeah, very nice.  So, we got lots of stuff to check out on opianthony.com. 
[02:33:00]  The tippy-tom, that's got to go up on YouTube.  You could take that picture.  I can't watch it's Sophie's Choice.  Yeah, the skid mark, yeah.  You could post that picture, and you'd get 8,000 answers as to what it is before what it actually is.  Oh, yeah.  A cloud ready to sprout a tornado.  Honest to God.  It does.  It looks like an aerial.  Yeah, it's an aerial shot of an island.  That would be what everybody would say.  It's where I'm taking my wife on vacation.  Yes, this is a very chicly. 
[02:33:30]  Shit state island, huh?  It's an all-inclusive hepatitis, corn, raisins.  Holy fucking God, he left that on that fucking chair.  What the fuck has he been eating for the last 10 years?  Oof.  Out of dumpsters.  That Sophie's Choice really hit a nerve with him, huh?  No kidding.  No!  No!  When he started yelling no when they were taking the kid away.  It's funny if you cut to the film and it was, like, super bad or something.  Just friends. 
[02:34:00]  No!  He was so upset.  We want to acknowledge our studio audience today.  Hi.  All four of them.  How you doing?  Everybody's waving.  Oh, five.  No, you work for us.  Or we weren't together, I should say.  That's about how many people I'll have at my show in New Jersey next week.  No, we'll do fine, Nick.  And we got, what, Cleveland?  Cleveland's representing.  Yeah, we were all talking about your boobs on the way over here today. 
[02:34:30]  Sam?  Oh.  You're from Cleveland?  Yes.  You know you have nice boobs, right?  Ask if she has any salt and pepper on.  Are you holding any salt and pepper shakers under your boobs?  Just need some spice.  Yeah, so, Cleveland, huh?  Yes, Cleveland.  I know.  And what do you do there?  I, like, work-wise or? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I work at a bank.  You work at a bank in Cleveland.  Okay.  I'm just so excited.  Yeah, that means you're sitting on your hands most of the day.  What is, yeah, giving out change.  What does your man friend there do?  Sean, he's a musician.  Ah.  Really?  Musician.  Yes.  In Cleveland.  Do you get naked or?  Of course. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, I thought you were talking to me.  Oh, yeah.  Nick.  Jesus.  Cock block.  We could play Deal or No Deal.  Thank you, man.  Should we play Deal or No Deal today?  I'm guessing working in a bank.  And the boyfriend is a, that is boyfriend, right?  Yes.  How long have you guys been together?  A year.  Three and a half years.  Three and a half years.  Yes.  You'll never make four.  Okay.  Jesus.  And let's see, you're only, you're a musician? 
[02:36:00]  Do anything else?  I work for an HVAC supplier.  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  Tin knocking supplier.  That's good.  In Cleveland.  If I was a tin knocker in Cleveland, I would get my pistol license just so I could shoot myself.  What's a tin knocker?  Ah, sheet metal installation.  You know, duct work.  I did a little bit of that in summers in high school.  Well, every guinea did a little bit of that.  I swear to God.  Anthony just decided to make a career out of it.  That's the difference.  I know.  We all had the crazy summer jobs. 
[02:36:30]  It was the law.  Anthony decided to make a career out of it for a while.  Yeah.  Should we play deal or no deal?  Deal or no deal.  How does that work, Opie?  Oh, how does that work?  I'm new here.  Well, um.  Her laugh is making me hurt.  You were saying you work in Akron?  Yeah.  Ah.  Yeah, based out of Akron.  Really?  All over Ohio and PA, though.  Oh, yeah?  You go all over the place?  Yeah.  At least Ohio, PA, and West Virginia.  It's not great areas.  Okay.  Are you guys, like, you're an item, obviously. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  It's three and a half years.  Does boyfriend dude, uh, is he going to get mad if we try to get his chick naked?  Oh, it's up to her.  That's her thing.  It's up to her.  Oh, it's her thing, though.  Pass the first hurdle.  All right.  Pass the, very good.  We're off to a good start, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It's her thing.  What, what does that mean?  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not in charge of her decisions.  See that?  You're not the boss of her.  That's right.  Have you, uh, gotten naked before?  Well, I assume she hasn't worn those clothes since birth. 
[02:37:30]  Ever?  You know, like...  In front of...  In front of people now.  Oh, so just like your boyfriend?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But tell her, now, the last girl that got naked in here ended up getting a model contract.  That's right.  Thank you, Nick.  That's true.  I'm so glad you mentioned that.  All right.  Elite, wasn't it?  Elite, yes.  Yes.  Some girls that get naked in here, it's very lucrative.  It was elite, or was it Show World?  How old are you?  Show World.  How old?  How old are you?  I'm 21.  Oh, God. 
[02:38:00]  What's wrong, Nick?  Nick is really enjoying his omelette.  His fucking shirt is 21.  I thought he just enjoyed the meal.  He's like, oh, God, that omelette's great now.  Yeah, I thought you found some salt and pepper.  You almost got less tasting it than the show does.  I saw...  So does shit.  I heard a gulp to my right, too, by the way.  When she said 21, I heard up.  Well, 21's very nice.  Nice.  It's fucking perfect.  I mean, it's nice.  What nice? 
[02:38:30]  20, 21, 22.  Some good ages.  Mm-hmm.  What...  So, and you've been going together for three and a half months?  20 years?  Yes.  21, 20, 19, 18, 17 and a half?  High school sweethearts.  High school sweethearts.  Where are you?  Don't do the math.  Oh, I did a little math, because how old are you there, rapist?  I'm 24.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, boy.  Where'd you meet her?  Chuck E. Cheese?  Holy shit.  Yeah, 17 and...  So she was in her...  She was 17 and change.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you were, what, 21? 
[02:39:00]  Ish.  I don't know.  Ish?  I don't know.  That's good.  You were almost 18.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's close enough.  It was close.  What's the age of consent in Ohio?  Ohio.  11.  Because I could be in trouble.  Oh, my God.  I'm teasing, of course.  Hmm.  Well, why don't you just come in the studio, I guess?  All right.  Why don't you hit the game show music?  You got a...  That's good news.  All right. 
[02:39:30]  We got a contestant.  Mm-hmm.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  And, um...  What's your name?  Erica.  Erica.  Yes.  It's Erica.  She's 21 years old.  She was from Cleveland, Ohio.  She's accenting her cleavage today, I noticed.  With a little necklace?  Yes.  Thingy?  Brings her eyes right to the boobs.  Um, how tall a gal are you?  Um, I'm 5'2".  You're 5'2", and, uh, you're a petite girl. 
[02:40:00]  How much do you weigh?  Well, probably a little over a hundred, maybe.  A little over a hundred.  Oh, man.  Jesus Christ almighty.  You gotta lose about five pounds.  Nick's just losing his mind.  Jesus Christ almighty.  Let me get this straight.  21, 5'2", 100 pounds.  Yeah.  Am I getting that right?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All righty.  All righty.  I don't want to annoy the listeners, uh, watching at home.  Now she's in here, so she's, um, at least willing to listen to the pitch. 
[02:40:30]  I'm pretty much just constantly in the way, but that's okay.  Now, uh, what are your measurements?  Well, you got brown hair.  Well, kind of like, right?  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, what color eyes?  Brown.  Brown.  Cute smile, right, Ant?  Very nice face?  Sure.  Um, I'm, I'm thinking they're full B's.  Yes.  Wow.  Opie.  I'm thinking, I, it's, it's a size you don't see often, but I'm thinking 32 full B's. 
[02:41:00]  Yes, actually.  You're exactly right.  Opie, Opie, amazing.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Opie's good.  Thank you.  And that's through a hoodie.  Thank you.  A hoodie and a little, uh, shirt under the hoodie.  Thank you.  I'm also good at guessing ages, but unfortunately we already gave the age out, so we can't play  that game today.  Mm.  We all remember how that worked.  Olingy lingy.  Uh, all right.  Well, um.  All right.  Well, I guess we're ready to play.  Well, I say she at least, like, removes the hoodie. 
[02:41:30]  It's a little warm in here.  Oh, the hoodie?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's take a look.  Okay.  Yes.  See, sir, you're doing very well for yourself.  Very well for yourself.  Uh, where did you two meet?  Um, at a bar in Cleveland.  Yep.  Figures.  No, I, no, I sing, and he sings, too, so.  Oh, wait, what do you sing?  Oh.  All right.  You're going to have to spend a penny today.  One of those bars where they play the piano and sing Dick's, Dick's song? 
[02:42:00]  Um, no.  What kind of singing do you do?  Karaoke?  What do you do?  No, um, I used to just sing, oh, I don't know, just.  Can you sing something for us?  Oh, my God.  Something from the fabulous Baker Boys?  What can you sing for us?  What genre of music?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, I grew up listening to, like, Jewel and everything, or acoustic stuff.  Can you do, like.  She grew up listening to Jewel.  She grew up listening to fucking Jewel.  I caught that, too, Nick.  What the fuck?  I grew up listening to Bing Crosby. 
[02:42:30]  Jesus Christ.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Can you sing a little Jewel for us?  Oh, my God.  I haven't sang in a long time.  What song would you feel comfortable singing?  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  Had a young pink song.  I'm a Barbie girl.  By the way, the TMZ kid has left the building.  He's on his way home.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  What, yeah, what Jewel, maybe a Jewel song?  We could play some in the background.  Give you some headphones so you could hear it.  Pat Tuffy, make her comfortable.  Take her hoodie away.  Just hope Duff washes his hands.  Just don't put it on that friggin' couch.  Put that in the evidence bag.  Good mark, couch.  Well, that's very nice.  Very nice.  Now I'm so nervous.  I don't know if I can sing.  You can sing? 
[02:43:30]  What song?  We'll even turn around so you don't have to look at us.  Pretend we're all in Tippy Tom's underwear.  Right.  Oh, my gosh.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I guess I could just sing acapella or something.  I don't know.  I just got over a really bad cold.  I actually had laryngitis.  All right.  Just sing a little something.  We just want to hear your voice. 
[02:44:00]  You know this one?  Can she hear it?  She can't hear it.  You want to sing along to it, Jewel?  We can hear it.  Oh, you can hear this?  Yes.  Wow, that sounds good.  Oh, shit, that was Jewel.  Wow.  I don't know if I can sing with the music.  All right.  Yeah, turn the music off.  She knows how to sing.  By the way, someone said, look at the pad data.  And I am.  And it says Bubbies.  What does that mean?  It's Booby Girl.  What?  I had to put something. 
[02:44:30]  Because it was Tippy Tom that was up there, so I had to change it to something.  So I just put Bubbies.  Bubbies.  That's Bubbies, though, no?  It's Bubbies.  All right.  It's however you want to pronounce it.  It's spelled B-U-B-B-I-E-S.  All right.  Fine.  What is she doing?  I don't know, but I like it.  Wait.  Are you plugging your iPod in?  No, I don't.  She's putting in the headphones.  That's her headphone, thanks.  You need some help with that?  No.  I worked at Radio Shack for six months.  Hey, does your boyfriend have a band? 
[02:45:00]  Um, he used to.  I know he's getting one soon.  His drummer's in Spain, so.  He's getting one soon?  Yeah.  He's picking one up at Best Buy this afternoon?  Why would you move to Spain when you could live in Cleveland?  He's actually there for school.  Ah.  Yeah, I know.  We're Spain?  Cleveland's great.  University of Madrid.  All right.  Let's hear you say it.  Berkeley.  Here she goes.  She's ready.  Okay.  She's wearing very low-cut jeans with a big black belt.  Very cute.  Now that we can see.  And some kind of a, I don't know what kind of top that is. 
[02:45:30]  We put the headphone pack on her belt and it pulled her jeans down a bit.  Yeah.  Very strategic move.  Can we put one on the other side, too?  One on the back.  On a bra strap.  All right.  Ready?  Okay.  Here we go.  Okay.  Oh, my gosh.  Okay.  Close your eyes.  Okay.  No, I'm nervous.  I'm sorry.  You shouldn't be.  Yeah.  Okay.  Most people would kill for a moment of exposure like this.  Exactly.  If they're a singer.  Get a gig in Iowa. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  And you two.  I can't even see the beginning.  Oh, it's the end.  Oh, my God.  That sounded good.  I'm so nervous.  It's all nerves.  It's nerves.  That sounded good, though.  It's just nerves.  Just loosen up and let it fly.  Have some confidence.  Let's go.  That sounded good.  And you took your coat off.  And you stood in the rain. 
[02:46:30]  You were always crazy like a mass.  And I walked from my window.  I always felt I was outside looking in on you.  And you were always mysterious one with dark eyes and careless hair. 
[02:47:00]  Oh, you are fashionably sensitive, but so cool to get home.  Oh, B.  No, boo.  That was very good, acapella.  Absolutely.  That was really bad.  No, no.  I'm sorry, guys.  No, I'm so nervous.  No, no, no.  What are you talking about?  That actually was very good.  Acapella.  Oh, B.  What's her name?  Oh, boo.  Erica. 
[02:47:30]  Erica.  Very nice.  That was very good, actually.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  That was really bad.  No, it wasn't bad.  Yeah.  Just saying.  You know, we could have been sitting here going, Jesus Christ.  It had a little Britney Spears in there.  No, I think it was pretty Jewish.  But Britney Spears was a...  Jewelish, not Jewish.  What?  It's a singing style.  Is that what...  Why did she just call you an ass? 
[02:48:00]  Do you do like...  She was emoting.  Yeah, it was good.  No.  Yo, that was hot, dog.  Yeah, kid.  Erica, I'd say you did quite well.  Have you tried out for American Idol?  Or tried?  No.  Why not?  I don't like American Idol.  Why?  I don't know.  It's like...  Neither of us like it.  I don't know.  It's kind of like a karaoke.  And they're not very good.  Not that I did good today, but...  Got any tats?  No. 
[02:48:30]  Okay.  I'm sorry.  What about the boyfriend?  Any tats?  No.  So, what would it take to get the shirt off?  Probably turning up the air conditioning.  Oh, look at...  She looked over at the boyfriend.  The boyfriend turned his head away.  It was that awkward moment when the boyfriend is here.  Was that awkward, sir?  He just threw his hands up and kind of went, eh.  Not a yes or no.  Erica, tell us what's going on.  Is he, like, mad?  No, not at all. 
[02:49:00]  How are you guys doing financially?  Financially?  Yeah.  We're okay.  Okay.  He has student loans, so...  Oh, student loans?  Yeah, they're really bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of guys got that crap, those student loans.  And the bank paying all right?  Yeah.  I mean, for what I do, yeah.  Yeah?  No problem making the rent and things like that.  You live together?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  We do.  Shared expenses.  Yeah.  Very nice.  That helps out a bit.  That does help. 
[02:49:30]  But what about credit cards?  You guys got a few of those?  Maybe stacked up a little bit too high?  No, actually.  Oh, good.  I just paid mine off, so...  Oh, you did?  You just paid them off?  Yes.  That's pretty good.  Smart move.  Meet the only bank teller who's set for life.  How much you got in the bank in your savings account?  Right now?  Yeah.  In ballpark.  Well, I just had to get the car fixed, so...  Oh, shit.  Not a lot, yeah.  Sounds like she needs them on.  A couple thousand? 
[02:50:00]  No.  A couple hundred.  My boyfriend just fainted over...  Yeah.  How much you got in your bank account, really?  A couple hundred.  Right now?  Yeah.  $700, though.  I'd say $570.  Probably about...  Almost a thousand?  Almost a grand.  Almost a grand.  How much did the car cost to get fixed?  It wasn't that bad.  It was, like, $300.  It really wasn't that bad, yeah.  Only a third of your savings.  Only a third of your savings.  30 in net worth.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:50:30]  30 in net worth.  You are an ass.  And you guys drove down to see us?  Yeah, well, here's the show tonight, so...  Or tomorrow night.  What do you mean, the show?  Hey, plug the show.  Yeah, if you guys plug the show...  Well, I didn't say we can plug the show tonight.  Oh, God, you scared me.  I'm not silly like that.  I've been partying to this show for quite some time, and I know the rules.  Is he playing?  I don't.  Is his band playing, even though...  He's playing by himself. 
[02:51:00]  He plays a guitar and sings.  Acoustic?  Mm-hmm.  A little acoustic show?  Yes.  He looks like my manager, Rick Dorfman.  Wait, do we have a guitar?  I think we gave it to a homeless guy.  Oh, motherfucker, we did give it to a homeless guy.  We let Tom shit in it, yes.  Dude, we got the deal.  If she makes us a little bit happier today, then we have the guy perform a song.  You're going to get massive exposure.  Way more people than you're going to get at your gig tonight.  You got a door deal at this club?  I'll do it if you guys come. 
[02:51:30]  So it's a door deal.  So the more people that come in, the more money you make.  I just left that one out there.  All right.  All right, now we need to...  How can we get a guitar?  I think...  We can get one.  Yeah, Tim's got one.  Hey, bro.  Yeah, we got one.  Is he on?  I can't hear him.  Yeah, I'm not talking.  There it is.  All right, listen, buddy.  Yeah.  If this all works out, we're going to get you a guitar, and we'll have you perform a song  live on our show today. 
[02:52:00]  All right, well, that's up to her, though.  No, I understand, but that's great exposure.  Yeah, of course it is.  You wouldn't mind, right?  I definitely wouldn't mind the exposure.  My musical exposure.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I see you're a little tentative.  And we might be able to, I don't know, maybe sweeten the deal a little bit.  She's hot, man.  We might be able to sweeten the deal.  Should we get the guitar?  How are we going to do this?  I'll find that funny that I'll do it. 
[02:52:30]  We did the boy.  All right.  We ran out to get the guitar.  All right.  Erica, so would you be willing to remove some clothing to allow your boyfriend to get national  exposure?  Yes.  Wow.  That's a girlfriend.  That is a girlfriend.  Wow.  How much clothing would be removed?  I don't know.  We could turn this into a 45-minute concert.  Depends how long the song is.  Oh, no.  Do it for me, please. 
[02:53:00]  I need something to think of.  We need some rules here.  Like, what do we need?  Like, down to panties.  What do we need?  Panties and bra.  Do we let her off the hook that way?  What do we do?  Nothing but her shoes.  Yes.  Yes.  That's it.  Yeah.  Nothing but her sneakers.  You're correct, sir.  I think, what's better?  Panties and bra or pants on and completely topless?  What would you say is better? 
[02:53:30]  Panties and bra.  Preferably for me.  I say panties and bra is better than just topless with pants.  I'm going to go with a...  But that doesn't necessarily mean it stops there.  Because like Opie said, the deal could be sweetened.  I'm going to go with snowsuit.  What?  What the hell is that?  I think you meant birthday suit.  No, snowsuit.  Snowsuit.  No, that was a joke.  All right.  So, would you be willing to do bra and panties?  That's like wearing a bathing suit. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  It is like the bathing suit thing.  We always say that, but it is.  That will get the plug out for the gig tonight.  Are they matching today?  Did you wear underwear today that are...  Hold on.  Yes, actually.  Pat Duffy just looked and made a...  Pat Duffy made a funny face.  What did you see, Pat?  They're orange.  They're orange?  What?  Oh, hot pink.  Oh, hot pink and orange are two different things, you dummy.  You might be colorblind.  Orange is silly.  Hot pink is hot. 
[02:54:30]  Don't blame him.  He's got hepatitis from yesterday.  He's losing his eyesight quickly from some disease.  As long as they don't have skid marks and polio.  He needs an eye on the lung.  Imagine if they look like tippy-toms are under them.  That fucking ruined the whole...  A big rock comes out of them.  Are you on your period?  No.  I was hoping period mustache today.  Fucking Opie's a little devil, isn't he?  Wow.  Period mustache.  No, we're really trying to get away from the grossness.  Make it look like you just had a candied apple. 
[02:55:00]  Jesus Christ.  The number of people on Paltog is just going up.  Up, up, and up.  It's crazy.  So, how do we start this, Opie?  We're waiting for...  You're the pro.  We're waiting for...  And you're not?  What the fuck, you shy motherfucker?  Help me out here.  Help me out here, Hendry.  Hey, Hendry, what the fuck, Hendry?  I know we're getting a guitar.  We can take a break and get the whole bit going.  How you doing, Hendry?  Take a break.  What happened?  Should've.  Yes. 
[02:55:30]  I wouldn't take a break.  No.  She apparently didn't want us...  What?  She has to go to the bathroom.  She has to tinkle.  Oh, shit.  You gotta make pee-pees?  Jesus.  I'm dropping.  I'd plug a year or two of days for that.  Can you...  Can you pee...  Can you pee on Pat Duffy's face today?  Oh, God.  I would drink her piss in a second.  Would you?  Yeah.  Wow.  Boy, I...  If we got a bucket...  Who the fuck wouldn't you?  And Pat Duffy put his head over it, would you just piss on his face? 
[02:56:00]  She goes, I...  He goes, I'd drink her piss.  Like, who the fuck wouldn't you?  It's like, I like cotton candy.  I say we break out the blue tarp cabaret.  Blue tarp cabaret?  Yeah, that's not true.  Would you just piss on Pat Duffy?  If we had you covered at all?  No.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  No.  That's all right.  Bro, you know how close...  She's...  You know how close you were to national exposure?  You have no idea. 
[02:56:30]  That's how bargaining goes.  All right.  It swings back and forth.  We made a lot of leeway with the plug and the panties and bra.  Yeah, we might have went a little too far.  But then we swung way too far over with the pissing on Pat Duffy.  Now we got to pull back a little bit.  But I thought we were pulled back because I was going for period mustache.  But she wasn't on her period.  And then the pissing on Pat Duffy, we see we went too far.  All right.  She's got to make pee-pees.  We got to get a guitar. 
[02:57:00]  It's like a hostage negotiator.  It really is.  How much do you love your kid?  Well, take a break.  Make sure she's not allowed to talk to her boyfriend.  Because I don't want the boyfriend talking her out of this.  Wow.  See, I told you.  He's a pro.  No, he's a cool...  That kid's a good-looking musician.  He's like 24.  Yeah, he's fine.  In three and a half years, this isn't going to jeopardize anything.  I mean, Jesus Christ.  He's ready for something else.  He's got a bunch of bank tellers lined up.  Bank tellers.  You got a bunch of guys coming in and hitting on you when they're trying to cash their little 
[02:57:30]  shitty paychecks and stuff, right?  Of course they don't.  Yeah.  The boyfriend's shaking his head.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  I got asked out the other day.  You what?  I got asked out the other day.  Really?  Yeah.  What'd you say?  I said, I'm sorry.  I have a boyfriend.  And he said, I'd like to make a deposit in your ass.  So what?  So you said you had a boyfriend?  Did he stop? 
[02:58:00]  Well, he came in, and it was before Easter, and we have to try and make conversation with  the customers and things like that.  Why didn't they make it do that?  Just around Easter, you mean?  No.  All the time.  But it was before Easter, and I was like, so do you have any plans for Easter?  Oh, no.  And he saw that as a fucking in.  I guess so.  Because he was like, oh, just hanging out with the parents.  You?  And I was like, oh, just family.  And he just said, oh, so, and he kind of sat there for a second, and I was like, okay, 
[02:58:30]  is he leaving?  Because he was done with this transaction.  Was he depositing a lot of money, or was he withdrawing?  What was he doing?  He was cashing a check.  Cashing a check?  Yeah.  How much was the check for?  I have no idea.  Was it big?  Did you look and go, wow, this guy, like, makes some change?  No.  No.  Okay.  He said jiffy lobe on it.  He said jiffy lobe.  Yeah, Pete May for Buffalo writes.  Yeah.  Hold on.  That's a lot of guts.  I could never, like, ask anyone out.  It's very nice, Tony.  But Pete May from Buffalo writes, is she a head teller? 
[02:59:00]  Are you the head teller?  No.  No.  Oh, Pete's trying to do the...  Of course.  Hey, Pete, how it going, buddy?  All right.  Listen.  What the fuck is this?  1971?  Wake up in a comedy world.  We are in a good place right now.  So let's let her do pee-pee.  Okay.  The guitar should be here by the end of the break, and we'll get something done today.  Okay.  Is there anything you guys can't get?  You're like, we need a guitar.  I know.  We really have to.  We got your omelets, right?  Make it work. 
[02:59:30]  Can you give me an eye and a lung?  This is what we got Nick today.  A guitar, an egg omelet, and a naked girl.  It's not a bad combo.  That's not very nice.  Potential.  Potential.  A naked girl.  Sorry, sorry.  Yeah.  Let's not...  Sorry.  All right.  Opie and Anthony will continue.  Spend an hour in this chair, alone in this room, and you'll feel sick.  Oh, God.  Afraid.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Ashamed.  Ah!  What the hell?  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:00:00]  Hey, Sam.  Here we are.  XM Satellite Radio.  Nick DePaul sitting in for Jim Norton.  Go to nickdip.com.  That's right.  Ah!  Let's say hi to Jeff in Chicago.  He has a fine observation.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to point out something really hilarious.  You guys got commercial ads that talk about the Pope coming to the United States, and then  they're following up with hard-on-pill commercials and sex toys and creams and everything else. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Right after the commercial for the Pope, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess XM is dedicated a whole channel to, like, the Pope's visit to the States or  something.  Why not?  Got 8,000 channels.  That's a little weird.  I think I can sell tickets.  He certainly can.  Yeah, no kidding.  Sell that place out.  He's a drawer.  He's going to be doing, you know, a town hall, I think.  No, Comedy Shop 815. 
[03:01:00]  That's right.  He's opening for me next Friday night and Saturday.  St. Pat's 316.  Is that when he's doing something like that?  Yeah, John 316.  All right, a lot of, well, U's Lad Bag writes, Opie, don't screw up getting this chick  naked.  All of the under-sexed husbands are counting on you.  Pressure's on.  Seriously, I get off so infrequently, I shoot Jell-O.  I need this.  Ugh.  Well, the guitar has arrived, right?  Hey, bro, can you play that?  Did you say tune it? 
[03:01:30]  Can you play that electric?  Oh, yeah.  I know you can, but I'm just saying, I mean...  Next appearance when Sam gets shot for being in front of the camera.  There you go.  Sam should be in Hollywood auditioning for these...  No kidding.  ...screwball comedies.  Screwball.  Because you don't know what he is.  Huh?  Because you don't know what he is.  Yeah, I'm not quite sure.  He'll fit a lot of demos for Hollywood.  He's exactly right.  He's very diverse.  Yes.  He's a one-man diversity.  The Jufro thing going on with him.  Well, he's got the black in him that he doesn't want to admit, but he does.  Well, you have to admit. 
[03:02:00]  Thomas Jefferson.  I don't know.  That hair didn't come from a suite.  Let's be honest.  The family of spotted owls nesting in his forehead.  Listen.  Nick, he's related to Thomas Jefferson.  Are you really?  Swear to God.  Gee, you don't get any more American than that, huh?  Swear to God.  Are you really?  Yeah.  What part?  The eyebrows?  Well, I think it was the other side of the family tree, if you know what I mean, when  he was doing his thing.  When he was going out back to the quarters. 
[03:02:30]  See, he likes to brag about being related to Thomas Jefferson.  Then you look at him, you're like, eh, that's from the side where he's banging slave girls.  One of those nights where Tom had to go back to the room and pick cotton out of his pubes.  I hear that side of the family doesn't get along with the other side of the family tree,  huh?  I don't know anything about that side of the family.  I was reading about the Thomas Jefferson thing.  They got the black side of the Thomas Jefferson family tree and the white side, and they've  been trying for years, because I guess they all get together. 
[03:03:00]  They have a big reunion, yeah.  Do you get invited to the big reunion?  Oh, no.  We've never been invited.  See, that's why, because you're part of the other side.  Have them all hanging out.  But the other side, they're trying to get one big reunion together.  Who can hit that gavel on the desk and blurt out some numbers?  Oh.  This is not what happens.  I don't know.  I wonder who does the cooking at that cooker.  Cleaning up afterwards.  Your turn this year.  Your side of the family.  Fuck you.  We did have a party. 
[03:03:30]  People in the white wigs get to go home.  Dude whose house got broke.  What?  What happened?  Remember the guy that called from prison?  Yeah.  I know she's hot.  We're going to get right back to that.  Yeah, Mike.  Mike from prison.  Yeah.  Well, remember the story?  Someone set up this story, because I got a nice one here.  Ant?  Yes.  Set up the story of Mike from prison.  Mike from prison.  He had called. 
[03:04:00]  What was the subject matter, though?  We were talking about...  Yeah, why did he call?  Why the hell did he call?  He just called out of nowhere.  Oh, the blow.  He was supposed to say hi.  Oh, right.  That's right.  What?  He apparently calls from time to time.  Oh, okay.  Well, he's in prison for just about five years.  He's got a five-year sentence, because he said he walked into someone's house and he  was drunk.  It was his neighbor.  All the doors looked the same in some kind of condo complex, I guess.  And obviously, it was the wrong house.  So, he was ready to leave, and as he turned around to leave, the homeowner jumped on him 
[03:04:30]  and tackled him and started beating him, and he didn't want to be beaten that hard, so  he started beating back on the homeowner, and when he was arrested for that, he got  arrested and put in prison for five years.  And then three years probation when he gets out.  Right.  When he gets out.  Well, the guy whose house he broke into is on the phone.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey. 
[03:05:00]  Are you for real?  Yes.  Yeah.  It was actually, I left work to go pick up a co-worker.  Yeah.  He's dropping his car off, and I'm listening to this story, and I'm like, damn, that sounds  so familiar.  And I don't really listen to you guys.  And I'm driving down.  God, I hope he beat you senseless then.  Wait, hold on, Chris.  Chris, hold on.  You're babbling.  Why don't you listen to us, first of all?  All right.  Why don't you listen to the...  No, not right now.  Like, we're asking you.  Yeah, what?  No, I'm not on the radio.  I'm not a... 
[03:05:30]  Just not a big radio guy.  Okay.  All right.  That's fine.  So you heard someone tell...  Yes, I heard the rambling.  So back when I got back to work, I went on the site and just to check out and see what  the guy looked like.  And yeah, that's him.  All right.  So what's your side of the story?  Four o'clock in the morning, I'm in bed with my wife.  She's pregnant with her first child.  And my wife wakes me up.  She goes, I hear her banging downstairs.  Holy shit.  I'm like, okay, you know, whatever.  Like any guy, I go back to sleep.  About a minute later.  No, Chris, really. 
[03:06:00]  I hear her banging.  You got to go check it out.  Did you grab your gun?  No, no gun.  Yeah, of course not.  Dummies.  Get guns, people.  Guns.  Okay, continue.  I wake up in the middle of the night and tell you somebody's banging on the door.  I think there's nobody there.  Little do I know, when I get down to the landing, I head downstairs.  Yeah, there's a guy standing right there.  He starts yelling about drugs and this sense and nonsense.  And he's trying to get back into like my bedroom area where my wife is.  I tackle him.  We kind of go at it.  We roll down the stairs. 
[03:06:30]  You know, fighting back and forth.  He's still trying to get back upstairs.  Put a beating on this guy.  He's high as a kite and just keeps trying to go back upstairs.  I finally get him dragged outside.  And he gets in his car and takes off.  And the cops find him, you know, in his mother's garage, passed out with, you know, a bunch of drugs and narcotics on him.  Oh, okay.  So he also had drugs on him.  Oh, yeah.  He rolled up in the pant legs of his pants. 
[03:07:00]  And I guess the cops were in the town he was from, knew him, and they kind of went light on him.  But when the cops from Cranford, New Jersey, brought him back, you know, they took care of him.  They frisked him and checked him and found all his drugs and then everything else on him.  So it's not like he's a really nice guy.  So, but five years for that?  That seems a little excessive.  Well, you know, we got into it.  You know, I mean, my house was relatively destroyed. 
[03:07:30]  I had some cuts and scratches.  And, you know, when I went to court, you know, I told the judge.  I was, you know, I was a fear for my family's life.  And, you know, that's how it goes.  But, you know, his story of, you know, five years and just coming back from a concert.  You know, from what I gather, he was at a party and then somebody stole some drugs.  And he was a tough guy that was going to go get him back.  And he thought, what, the guy lived in your house?  Yeah, he thought the guy lived in my house.  I guess he had the wrong address or.  Okay.  Then he's got some kind of a.  So he broke down the door with like a tire iron. 
[03:08:00]  Was your door unlocked?  Wait, he broke down the door with a tire iron?  The guy said it was unlocked, remember?  Yeah.  It wasn't unlocked.  It was the front door.  He knocked out the.  It was like a wood door.  I guess the center slat.  Yeah.  Knocked it out.  Opened it up.  Opened it up.  Opened it up on his own.  And then.  That was the center of the colonial.  This guy.  Walk upstairs.  Yeah.  Okay.  So breaking and entering.  And then.  And with intent.  Right.  Yeah.  And drug possession.  And everything else.  It wasn't just the breaking and entering. 
[03:08:30]  You know, my role in it was very minimal.  You know what I mean?  Even though it was the wrong house.  He broke in with the intent of doing some kind of harm.  Or getting drugs back.  Yeah.  This guy's fucked.  Wow.  You know what I mean?  His story of being a good guy and everything else.  But he was high as a kite.  Like, you know.  Now, I put a pretty good beating on him.  Do you think?  To the point where my hands were swollen from hitting him.  And, you know.  You know.  I was a little bloodied up.  And, you know.  He got some good licks in on me, too. 
[03:09:00]  But.  I couldn't stop him from trying to keep going upstairs.  Yeah.  And that's where the pregnant wife is.  I would have shot the hell out of him.  Of course you do.  See.  There you go.  Out of thought.  The cops were cool as hell, too.  They were like.  If you shot him.  They were like.  There's nobody in the world that's going to convince you.  I love how that happens.  Just shoot him.  Hold on a minute.  We got the TMZ kid calling in.  I told you he left the studio.  TMZ kid.  What's up?  I told you that guy was a bag of shit.  He concurs. 
[03:09:30]  I wanted to prove the point.  Yeah.  Bag of shit.  This makes more sense now.  Yeah.  Because the TMZ kid who might be in the profession.  And he was hanging out with us today.  He said this guy had to have done a lot more than what he's saying.  Yeah.  And now we get on the other side of the story from Chris here.  There was something wrong with the car, too.  I don't know.  I don't think the car was really.  I don't think the car was his.  I think the car was like a girlfriend's parents.  And he crashed out on the way back.  Or to my house.  Or something along those lines.  Yeah. 
[03:10:00]  He was out on a little tear.  Yeah.  There was a list of charges from numerous sources.  Oh, man.  Do you sleep well at night now?  No.  We had to move.  You know, every time a car went down the street and backfired, we had to pick up and move.  And, uh...  Did you get a gun?  Yeah, did you?  Yeah, exactly.  No.  I'm thinking I would get a gun in that situation.  You didn't get a gun?  No.  You know, it happens so fast.  It's like...  No, no.  Do you have a gun now?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  I had a gun then, too.  But I didn't think to...  I didn't think to get it.  All right.  Why?  I didn't hear that part of the story.  Oh, my God.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Exactly.  That's when it happens.  Does it happen at one o'clock in the morning?  It's too early to get my gun.  You don't need a gun at noontime.  Yeah.  A sunny...  Sunny afternoon.  Yeah, a nice afternoon.  When you take it to the beach?  I'm in my boxers.  Oh, well, you'll just look silly then.  Right.  Leave the gun upstairs.  Right?  You can't walk around in boxes with a gun. 
[03:11:00]  Chris, you need to...  Yeah, of course I do.  Chris, you need to start listening to this show now.  We have some kind of weird connection.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Maybe.  This guy doesn't like us.  Jesus.  Really, it's not you guys.  I'm just...  Oh, shut up.  I hope it happens again.  How old's your daughter now?  Real nice.  My daughter is two and a half.  Real nice.  Two and a half.  Real nice, he says.  Jesus, thanks.  I go through this trauma.  Yeah.  Time out.  I think this guy's full of shit, too.  Why? 
[03:11:30]  Because didn't this guy say he's been in jail for four years already?  Yeah, four years.  And this guy said his wife was pregnant when it first happened?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the daughter's only two and a half?  Oh, look at Quincy putting together.  Oh, Chris, what's that about?  No, my wife lost that one.  It's not the same child.  Oh.  Oh, that's a lie.  I had a gun.  I didn't have a gun.  It happened in Cranford, New Jersey.  The address was 20 Lincoln Ave West in Cranford, New Jersey.  Wow.  Now we can break it.  But, no, really.  It was.  My wife lost that child.  Oh, sorry to hear that. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, if you had a gun, she'd be fine.  Yeah.  Probably the trauma.  Too bad we didn't know you back then.  We could have done something with that.  About three or four years.  For the show.  Jesus.  Make that mustache.  Go ahead.  The old kitchen floor-cursed splat mustache.  Sorry, boys.  It's a good day.  Get her naked before I get to work.  Oh, God.  All right.  Thank you, TMZ Kid.  Bye.  All right.  Well, Chris, thanks. 
[03:12:30]  We were wondering about the other side of the story.  We got it.  That rarely happens on this show.  Yeah.  Have a good weekend.  Take it easy, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, man.  Give us a try.  Yeah.  No, I don't think he's going there.  No, he's not going to listen to us.  We suck.  Back to Erica.  Ah.  And a guitar.  Can we get our priorities straight here?  Yeah, sure.  No problem there, Nick.  Nickdip.com.  Steve.  Yeah.  Can we hear the guitar somehow?  You can tell me if you hear it.  Yeah, go ahead.  Got anything?  Yeah, if you're fucking Dave Fogelberg. 
[03:13:00]  I was going for soft guitar.  Cat Stevens, maybe.  No, you nailed it.  No, I didn't.  I said Dave instead of Dan.  Oh, you didn't say Dan?  I fucked it up.  Uh, I couldn't get to the laugh track fast enough, Fast Freddy.  Sorry.  Oh, God.  Sorry to disappoint.  Jesus.  Sorry to disappoint on that one.  I don't think that would have been very nice.  And a big thank you to everybody that is congratulating us on our new deal.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, thank you.  We'll focus a lot on the negative, but there's a lot of positive coming in.  Nobody's more happy about that than I am.  Yeah.  Did you hear about the little bit of controversy about our statement? 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Well, in the statement, it says something like, we look forward to our next firing or something.  With great anticipation.  Right.  Thought it would be kind of funny.  Sure.  Throw that in.  You don't want the pat fucking, you know, stupid corporate, yes, we're happy to blah,  blah, blah.  So, you know, throw in something funny.  Like, we look forward to our next firing with great anticipation.  Yeah.  It's what you do.  You fucking...  And then I heard somebody was upset because it was like, well, we don't want to reflect  or have these people in the paper bring up the old stuff. 
[03:14:00]  But it's like, that's what we want them to do.  And they're going to bring it up anyway.  Yeah.  And they're going to bring it up anyway.  So, hey, this is what we have to deal with on this show.  There's a guy named Joe Camp.  I'm sure that's his real name from Jersey.  He writes, someone just said that you said this morning, I don't know why people are  hating on us.  It's not like we're Bubba, the love sponge, and we suck.  You guys are a fucking joke.  You are nothing but jealous of Howard and Bubba.  Ah, Bubba.  Stop it.  We didn't even say anything.  That's not what you said.  We made fun of Bubba this morning because he thought he had inside info that we were 
[03:14:30]  going to be off regular radio by the end of April.  He said we would not be re-signing with CBS.  That's exactly what that fat cunt said.  And fuck him.  Oh, you dummies.  Then why are you listening to this show?  That's what I don't get.  Oh, just fucking listen to your heroes.  Leave us alone.  All right, Steve, let's hear that guitar.  It's not happening yet.  Not happening yet?  All right, Erica, let's get back to Erica, Anthony.  Yeah, she's been standing there for an hour. 
[03:15:00]  She's been standing in the same position for an hour.  How dumb is this one?  Let's get her in a different position.  You used the facilities?  How did you find the facilities?  Lovely.  Very good.  Did the pee come out okay?  Oh, it doesn't smell like...  That woman's room doesn't smell like the men's room.  No, the men's room smells like a monkey cage.  It's horrific.  We think there's something dead in the drops.  It has to be.  Yeah, it's a person.  Yeah.  All right, help me out here. 
[03:15:30]  So why don't we remove the shirt just to get comfortable?  All right.  Are you wearing some kind of brassiere?  Oh, you got another shirt under there.  Oh, it's a tank top.  Oh, it's a tank top.  All right, well, it's a tank top.  I'm taking both off of one.  That's kind of nice.  It's a little mystique in the whole thing.  Can we cut clothes off you today, or is that going too far?  You probably need these clothes, right?  Wearing layers like she's in the Arctic.  Can we cut the clothes off?  You guys are fucking the...  You don't know it to the ass there, Nick.  You're absolutely right. 
[03:16:00]  It's a tank top.  I used to just cut them off in high school.  Very slim girl.  Yeah, we got a couple from Cleveland, if you're just tuning in.  My stomach's flatter than a lesbian's ass.  It's perfect.  Oh, God, help me.  There goes the...  The tank top.  She's got a tank top on.  And a pink...  You can see her pink bra strap.  Pat Duffy thinks it's orange.  It's orange.  Shut up, orange.  What's it like to be interviewed by an Amish fella, Erica?  All right, Erica's now down to a tank top.  What did I tell you?  Is that stomach burning?  What did I fucking tell you? 
[03:16:30]  Now, yeah, the other shirt comes off.  And there's some...  A pink...  She just wanted to come down and see the show.  A nice pink bra.  You know, David Letterman doesn't do this to his studio audience.  Right, you know?  Aren't we terrible?  We kind of have like that...  We got like the bleachers, and we invite the fans to come in just to hang out and watch  the show, and next thing you know, they're getting naked.  Well, that's lovely.  Don't worry about it.  That's an hourglass figure.  You don't have to put your arms up like that or anything.  I'm going to put my necklace on. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  I'm afraid we'll steal it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This is in the 97.  Do you shave everything down there?  Yeah.  Jesus, they all do, huh?  Well, I don't know.  That's the thing to do.  Rumor has it that, you know, the big bush is coming back.  Is it?  It's like trying to find hair at St. Jude's waiting room.  I'm not kidding, man.  I like a little patch or something down there.  It's like a tit with no nipple. 
[03:17:30]  Something to let you know where you are.  Yeah, exactly.  It's pitch black in there.  I don't be licking your fucking heel.  Hello.  I need something.  Give me a sign.  Some kind of sign.  You need something to help you direct your attention, right?  A swastika or a fucking Mets logo.  Something.  Help me out.  Is she not curvy or is it me?  What the fuck?  That's a beautiful figure.  Yeah, you got a very nice figure there, Erica.  Erica, honest to God.  The guy's doing all right out there. 
[03:18:00]  I was in my early 50s.  I'd make a move.  How's the guitar?  I'm trying to get an amplification device.  They're ripping the walls apart.  Look at these.  Look at them.  They're ripping the walls apart to make this happen.  Fuck this place.  Fuck it.  I've never seen guys work harder for our show in all the years we've been doing this.  Mars has just uncovered a Being John Malkovich door behind the television.  What the hell is that?  What's going on back there?  I don't know.  I see graffiti on the walls back there. 
[03:18:30]  Oh my God.  I think it's an after hours club.  We just found Wolfman Jack's bones.  Dude, what's behind there?  Anything cool?  An amplifier.  A couple of Jews hiding.  Dead hookers.  Have you guys ever gone back there?  No.  Together.  That's Mars territory.  Oh yeah?  There's wires and things.  Oh really?  Gotta be careful.  A little PV amp comes out.  That's cool, man.  Look at that.  All right.  Remember how long it took to get Tom mic'd properly yesterday?  Oh yeah, yeah.  The hot chick response rate is fantastic. 
[03:19:00]  All right.  I think you should take the belt off.  Right, Nick?  Yes.  The belt.  All right.  That's a nice big black belt.  She's wearing what are known as hip huggers.  Yes.  There, Nick.  Hip hugger jeans.  They hug the hips.  Hence the name.  Hip hugger.  There she, uh...  Did she get those jeans from Baby Gap?  Those are some small jeans.  They are perfect.  I couldn't have designed it better if I was Calvin Klein.  Some people commenting saying she looks like, um... 
[03:19:30]  Who do people say you look like?  Anyone?  Oh, I don't know.  I get things all the time.  She looks like a girl at the bank.  Some bank in Cleveland.  No, people are saying you look like the girl from Harry Potter.  I've grown up a little bit.  Oh, my God.  You just wrecked a lot of fantasies out there.  What?  Wrecked?  I don't know.  You don't like Hermione?  She's got a little Jennifer Jason Leigh in her room.  Remember, Jeremy?  Oh, yeah.  A little bit in the eyes.  A little bit in the eyes or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Demi Moore's boobs. 
[03:20:00]  Demi Moore's boobs.  You're making her fucking Franken-celebrity?  Come on.  She's whoever she is.  In the stomach of...  Steve, we got the guitar working?  Dick Van Patten.  Do you work out at all?  You just naturally.  Or is that just...  I used to a lot.  What?  You could say.  No, I belly dance, so that...  You belly dance. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  I knew, because she's got the body for a belly dance.  Boy, you kept that quiet.  You got good, like, the hips and everything.  Can we see a little belly dancing?  Can I play Cat Scratch Fever?  I know the first eight notes.  Why would you belly dance?  For the workout?  Or did you do it at a restaurant?  I don't know.  I love it.  I don't know.  Can you do that wavy thing with your belly?  Do that wavy thing.  Yeah.  Wait, what's your nationality?  Oh, I'm a bunch of different things. 
[03:21:00]  Like, I'm a quarter German, a quarter Mexican, a quarter Lebanese, and a quarter Native American.  Wow.  I know those some Indian in there.  I know it.  Do the belly dance, gypsy woman.  Yeah.  Let's see the belly dance.  Do you need music?  Can you make it go, like, in and out like that?  I just want to see what it makes those wavy things.  Like, yes.  Yeah, yeah, like that.  We could...  I'm hungry.  My stomach's like growling.  So is New York.  Like that? 
[03:21:30]  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, yeah, that was it.  Probably like a smoothie.  You want some music for this?  We could play some Quiet Riot or something.  Quiet Riot for belly dancing?  I think you need some Indian music or something.  Oh, here it is.  Here we go.  Turn it up a little bit.  What is that?  Well, that's good.  If you're at a black club in the 20s.  Where am I?  Oh, there it is.  I think I'll use the toilet.  All right, here we go.  A little belly dancing as we get the guitar ready.  Okay. 
[03:22:00]  Look at that.  Her pants are staying still, but she's moving.  She just shut down the entire radio show.  Oh, my God.  What a treasure this was.  Why can't you do it?  You're just getting into it.  Look at us.  Over here. 
[03:22:30]  I get the soundtrack of my car, by the way.  Yeah.  That girl's got some moves.  Is Sam filming this?  She's got a great figure.  You want to get views on YouTube.  It's 30 seconds of her belly dancing.  A million views.  Guaranteed.  Do you belly dance anywhere?  Or are you just like, just for personal use?  I guess, whatever you call it.  I don't know what you'd call that.  Personal use. 
[03:23:00]  Personal use.  Just use it for my own head.  I don't sell.  All right.  One more.  We're getting some good footage, because we're going to put this on YouTube.  We're going to turn everybody on to the belly dancing video, and it's going to do quite  well.  So look right into the camera that Sam's holding, and give us like 30 seconds or so.  Can you slap that on Nick Dipp, too?  No problem.  Jesus Christ.  It'll be featured on the front page of Nick Dipp.  I'm going to put a sneeze guard on my laptop.  He made her laugh in the middle of the dance.  I'm sorry.  I'll shut my pie hole.  Back to those hips, girly. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  Concentrate.  Here we go.  Pocket.  Pocket.  That's how I walk into the locker room at my gym.  All right.  Sorry.  One more.  One more little thing.  One more.  She was really getting into it.  Oh, my God. 
[03:24:00]  She's adorable.  One more.  Sam's got the camera.  Here we go.  Erica from Cleveland, belly dancing.  Boom!  Oh, jeez.  That's not even right.  That was so good.  No, the reviews are coming in, and they're just unbelievable.  The reviews are amazing.  Very nice.  Roger Ebert just spit up blood from his cancer.  What?  All right.  Where's the amp? 
[03:24:30]  That was so good.  It's right there.  It's ready to go.  All right.  Well, we just got to get the mics on.  That's all.  All right.  Are we losing the genes now for the song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Nick says yeah.  Nick makes the rules.  I don't make the rules.  I was going to say, these guys, I'm giving them a break today.  They work too hard.  Nick makes the rules.  I'm sorry.  At least you match.  That's nice.  Yeah.  It's like wearing a bathing suit.  Yeah.  Oh, my fucking heart.  Hold on two seconds.  All right. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, fucking A.  All right.  Pat, what do you think?  How's the view over there?  I have very sweaty palms.  Really?  You're dying?  Yeah.  That's what I think.  No, she's ridiculously beautiful.  All right.  Yes.  Ridiculously.  Wow.  I agree.  I should compliment her.  That's not an exaggeration.  She's got underoos on.  Underoos.  Oh, my.  All right.  The jeans are coming off. 
[03:25:30]  I'm going to learn to play guitar.  I'm so, I'm sorry.  I'm really modest.  So what?  It's so beautiful.  I'll take my clothes off.  I'll take my boots off.  Make it even.  It's just, it's just like wearing a bathing suit.  It is like a bathing suit.  Really?  And you got nothing to be ashamed of.  That's for sure.  Your boyfriend's a lucky gentleman.  Really?  I'm going to sniff his fret hand.  All right.  Well, the jeans are coming off now.  Eric is five foot one. 
[03:26:00]  Right around a hundred pounds.  Thirty-four.  Twenty-one.  Thirty-four solid bees.  And a very nice brown-panty combo.  Curvy, curvy, curvy.  All right.  I feel so dumb right now.  I'm sorry.  Oh, there's no need to feel dumb.  Why would you feel dumb?  That's, that's, that's silly.  Is there a sneaker getting caught in the jeans and that's what making you feel dumb?  You'll, what, Anthony, why should, there's no reason she should feel dumb.  No.  That's for sure. 
[03:26:30]  He keeps, like, pulling the jeans out and pulling them off.  There you go.  Look.  See how easy that was?  All right.  Put that in the evidence bag.  Pat dumping.  She should be funny.  Look how modest she is.  How far should be funny?  You shouldn't be modest at all.  Right.  You've got to be kidding me.  You're perfect.  Okay.  Now, now, now we go to the point where no one talks.  We just kind of stand here.  I'm flashing back to my senior prom.  I'll pick him the cops.  My girlfriend's crying. 
[03:27:00]  He's a ripped dress.  All right.  Bring an old buzzkill.  How about we get a pirouette?  A little pirouette.  Here comes buzzkill.  A slow.  Oh, Christ.  The boyfriend.  Fuck.  We forgot about him.  God bless you, dude.  The pesky.  Make her spin around, Pat.  God bless you, dude.  The pesky boyfriend.  Just a little spin.  The pesky boyfriend.  Holy moly, at last, my love has come along. 
[03:27:30]  Now, uh.  Hey, who's the kid with the sweatshirt and the dumb shorts?  How you doing?  What the fuck are you, half cholo?  These young fellows with their culottes.  All right.  Culottes.  Is the boyfriend mad?  That's what they were.  You're totally cool?  We called those culottes in the 80s.  What's your name?  Sean.  Sean, okay.  Sean and Erica, right?  When was the last time you had sex?  What after breakfast? 
[03:28:00]  This was, uh.  I don't know.  Better, yeah.  It was like last weekend.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  You better have been in prison.  Well, he has, but it's three years, right?  Last weekend, why?  Um.  I don't know.  It's a good question.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  We're really busy.  We're preparing for the trip over here, actually, so it's kind of taken up a lot of the time.  Yeah.  I've been really tired.  Plus, I've been sick lately, too, so.  Uh-oh.  He's been trying to stay away from me.  Unless it was AIDS.  Yeah, exactly.  You could have open sores on your fucking forehead. 
[03:28:30]  I'd be sucking the pus out of him like it was 16, 15.  I don't want his voice to get, you know, messed up.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  He's got a show, a big show this week.  Yeah.  That's right.  Very nice.  Ooh, is this guitar?  Could I hear something off Double Live Gonzo?  What?  Wait, where is...  Oh, why would it work?  Oh, there we go.  All right.  Oh, that's how we get them.  Well, we got to get our top one.  Yeah, I want to see now how he got...  Yeah, this will allow him to play and show his expertise. 
[03:29:00]  There is...  And then for the big plug on where it is, I think at least, you know, the...  Sure.  Sure.  The bra's got to...  Yeah, yeah.  There we go.  But we'll figure that out later.  You know any Tilt Tuesday?  Yeah, close enough, I guess.  What, close enough?  So, play whatever?  Yeah, yeah.  Play whatever you feel is like one of the best representations of what you do.  Wait, what was he going to say, though? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, what were you going to say?  I didn't know if you were allowed to even do covers.  I really don't do covers at my show, though, so...  We could do anything here.  This guy's the real deal.  He plays his own shit.  Really?  We could do anything.  What's your sound?  Like, who do you sound like?  Um, kind of like a cross between Damien Rice, Jack Johnson, David Gray.  Ah, David Gray, I reckon.  Marine Five type stuff, I don't know.  Damn.  And why don't you just go solo?  Why are you getting a band together?  Well, I mean, I play a lot of shows solo, but to be honest with you, it's kind of difficult  to grab the attention of a bar if you don't have drums, so...  That's right.  All right. 
[03:30:00]  So, I would love to see, like, Erica Topless as you were playing, because that would be  really weird, because you'd be kind of, like, taking a look at her as you're trying  to like him.  You know what I mean?  Like, there's a whole dynamic there.  Well said, Casey Casey.  Jesus Christ.  Make a hell of an interrogator.  We'd kind of...  We'd love the info, just so that we could get it from you here now.  I'm gonna hum...  It's time we need that pertinent information.  Well, Erica, do you lose the bra, or...? 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, during the song.  He's got to hit that solo part.  Just like, you know, when they met.  For the...  This is what we do.  For the bra, Sean plays an original.  Sean, there could be up to a million people listening right now.  That's true.  Or 10,000 to 20,000, depending on what article you read.  Right.  You have your own magazine out of it?  They just don't know for sure how many people are listening to satellite radio.  For the bra, an original song from you, my friend. 
[03:31:00]  The name...  And a MySpace plug, sure.  Okay.  Well, that's actually up to her.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I didn't mean to say okay.  You're not gonna let them down now, are you, Erica?  Okay.  Oh.  That was nice.  More uncomfortable silence.  Yeah.  Right now?  Well, better than after the show. 
[03:31:30]  How old am I?  I'm fucking watching CNN about troop deployments.  The sea.  Boom, boom deployment.  Fucking Middle Eastern cocksuckers.  All right.  Just reaching around back.  So should I start then?  Come on, Duffy.  Help her out.  We need to spell it on the pad data because they're spelling chick.  C-H-I-K.  Oh, Jesus.  They're morons.  Just morons.  The bra is unstrapped.  That was Butcher.  She's doing a very sexy kind of holding the bra in front of her thing. 
[03:32:00]  As soon as she hands the bra to Pat Duffy, you go, Sean.  You start playing.  But name the song and everything.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't look.  Don't look.  Don't look.  Don't look.  No, I'm nervous.  Yeah.  I'm gonna make you feel alone.  No need to be.  We're, uh...  All right.  All right.  This one's, uh, called Hypnotize.  This one's my song.  You're gonna let that.  Uh, Pat, do a little, uh, talking.  There you go.  Oh, see? 
[03:32:30]  There's no problem there.  Wait, hold on.  You're messing up Sean's song, though.  Oh, girl, you came, and then you went.  You took your flight, and I was left.  You left me high, and I was dry.  You didn't call a little bit of closure, what I held.  But the best thing you said, when you got out of bed,  I love you, I hate you, I didn't want to even date you. 
[03:33:00]  Well, you left the messages you want me to hear  I threw the tape out, and I opened the bill  And then a phone call from a number unknown  Said, pick me up, cause I want to come home  Well, I don't care anymore  You had me hypnotized  But I'm awake now  I don't care anymore 
[03:33:30]  You had me hypnotized  But I'm awake now  Thinking about things we used to do  When I were all alone  Oh, no  Then I call, and you pick up and treat me like  You got no time for me now  But you stick them over  All dressed up for me 
[03:34:00]  And it's so wrong  Oh, no  Maybe next time I should tell you  So long  I don't care anymore  You had me hypnotized  You had me hypnotized  But I'm awake now  I don't care anymore  You had me hypnotized  But I'm awake now  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
[03:34:30]  He's got talent.  And do you use your last name so people can find you? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, it's SeanBenjamin.  Benjamin?  SeanBenjamin.com or MySpace.com.  SeanBenjamin.com he got.  Look at that.  It's spelled S-E-A-N, though.  S-E-A-N, the Irish way.  Very, very nice.  I mean, nothing but positive reviews.  One guy did say, this guy's really good if I liked dudes.  I imagine the girls would love.  I run into that a lot.  The girls love your sound, I'm sure, right?  Let me say, the couple itself getting a rave review. 
[03:35:30]  Yes, both of you.  I was very surprised you weren't belly dancing to Sean's music.  You didn't want to take the attention away from him?  Like there was attention on me.  I don't know, what was that music bed that was playing when she was standing there?  Did we play a song?  Wow, that was a good job.  Yeah, when are you going to play your song?  Should we do another one if she belly dances?  Yeah.  You really got a song that you could belly dance to, you think, Sean? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  Something bluesy?  Yeah.  Yeah, blues would probably do that.  Flat at fifth.  Also known as your second single, don't get stupid.  The B-side.  Play your second favorite song.  Of course.  Don't be dumb.  You guys look like a good manager, over here.  Right.  So, wait, you got a belly dance, though, or we turn this mic off.  There's a house in Ohio.  Wow, that's a nice website, too, I see.  What, are we on it or something?  No, I'm looking at it.  It's SeanBenjamin.com. 
[03:36:30]  Very nice.  In MySpace, Sean Benjamin.  Are you going to belly dance for us, Erica?  One more song.  Lots of people listening.  And she is belly dancing.  I stand to rake in, the world stands off your tongue. 
[03:37:00]  We just met, but you said, we could steal the life's important.  And you're conscious of the moves that you make, fabric, thin, oak, and skin, and you want me to break now.  I'm not the kind to mend.  This happens to, oh, no. 
[03:37:30]  And I try to play it, oh, oh, but it's see-through.  Don't just tell my girl, put her in an action.  Want to see if it's about to happen.  Give me spots like a jam reaction.  That you're dancing like that.  It's clear about a stare in your eyes, that you know that you do.  And it's just to make me want you, yeah.  Into your doorway, some clothes stay in the hall. 
[03:38:00]  You got some in your room, more inviting and all now.  No need for more drinks, cause I'm both by the possibilities of you and me.  And she brings, oh, oh, oh, on to me.  I'm not the kind to mend. 
[03:38:30]  This happens to, oh, no.  And I try to play it, oh, oh, but it's see-through.  Oh, oh.  Don't just tell my girl, put her in an action.  Want to see if it's about to happen.  Give me spots like a jam reaction.  Do you know that you're dancing like that?  It's clear about a stare in your eyes, that you know that you do.  And it's just to make me want you. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, my God, man.  Wow.  I thought we were going to listen to some hack today from Cleveland.  Some crappy music or something.  And the guy's doing a great job.  I can't beat this guy up.  That sounded great.  SeanBenjamin.com.  A lot of people are asking if there's a website called SeanBenjamin'sGirlfriend.com.  They're pretty much like, screw the music.  Is there a website called SeanBenjamin'sGirlfriend.com?  That's not bad, man.  Thank you.  Are you getting any attention out there? 
[03:39:30]  Not really.  Not really.  No, I mean, I play around the Ohio college towns and PA.  And now this is my second show in New York.  We actually came here last time I had a show in New York, and I had my guitar with me.  Unfortunately, I didn't have it this time.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because we just got off the train.  It was the day that Dr. Steve put his hand up there.  You guys were here that day?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were here that day.  What the fuck were we thinking?  No, no, no.  You got attention for her on Pal Talk that day, too.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, well, you were focusing the camera on her when she was in the bleachers. 
[03:40:00]  I still remember that now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great that we remember that Pat Duffy got a finger up his ass, but we don't remember  seeing him.  Yeah, great.  That's wonderful.  That was much more important.  Speaking of fingers up asses, another song.  Dr. Steve's going to put his finger up Tippi Tom's ass next time he's in town.  Yeah, he's going to give him an erectile exam.  Yeah, and he's going to diagnose him for us.  Yeah, that's pretty fucking bad.  That's...  Oh, fuck. 
[03:40:30]  Wow, man.  I'm going to throw up on my song.  Hey, where are you playing in New York?  Tonight, I'm playing at the Alphabet Lounge, 830, in the East Village.  It's 104 Avenue C.  Right on.  Okay.  There it is.  The big plug.  Hopefully a few fans will come down and check you out.  Please come out.  Is your girlfriend going to be there?  Yeah, she'll be there.  Okay.  That'll get the fans to show up, too.  Exactly.  Be prepared not to buy one drink for yourself.  Yeah, no kidding.  And you'll be prepared to jump off the stage and beat people up.  Do you have a CD? 
[03:41:00]  Because I want to throw it in the river, because I'm really stupid when it comes to discovering  bands and musicians.  Basically, I've only pretty much done live stuff and acoustic stuff, because I've never  had the money to go into a studio with a band.  The famous story, Godsmack gave Ant and I, or myself, whatever, a CD before he made it,  Sully.  Sully was kind of a friend of ours back in the day.  We did our radio show a bunch here and there.  And I, because I was sick of getting CDs from bands, I threw it out into the river on 
[03:41:30]  the way back down to Boston.  And we all know what happened to Godsmack, so.  Yeah, they went nowhere.  We could have been the guys.  Instead, it was, dude, Rocco.  Rocco.  Hey, I discovered these guys.  Dude.  That's like Manny that on the Comedy Cellar.  He's the one who told Bob Dylan to take a hike.  Yeah.  You never know.  He said, you stink, don't come back.  Not very influential in music.  So I'm going to be nice to this Sean Benjamin guy, because you never know. 
[03:42:00]  He might make it.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, we're down to panties, Anthony.  Yeah, it seems to be the...  At this point, we might have to break out some wallets.  Ah, you're showing your hand too quick.  Yeah.  And you keep everything well-kempt, right?  You're all, uh...  Just imagine if Sean Benjamin got a third song played for a national audience.  That's like a mini showcase right there.  That's big. 
[03:42:30]  I mean, two is pretty big.  International.  This is worldwide.  There are people in Guam, Japan, India, England.  How about this?  With iPods.  How about this?  We, uh, we hang up on everybody.  I want people to call from, uh, around the world.  Just out the ante.  Just to prove how big this audience is today.  All right?  People are saying...  What?  Plugs for life.  I'm going to call and say I'm from Korea. 
[03:43:00]  A lot of people...  Really?  Really coming up from, uh...  Todd from Beijing.  That doesn't make any sense.  Let's go to James in Georgia.  James.  Oh, boys.  How are you?  Good.  Uh, Nicky, you're killing the day, buddy.  Thank you.  We don't...  Don't throw the guy a CD in the river, man.  You need to push the hell out of him, man, because he's got the perfect sound for what's  going on these days, man.  So...  Yeah, he does.  The hell out of him.  Oh, he absolutely does.  No?  I was just, like, telling a little story.  I wouldn't throw his stuff away. 
[03:43:30]  I didn't mean to throw Godsmack's stuff away back in the day.  I was just an angry man back then.  Are you calling from an insane asylum?  What the hell is that screaming?  Hey, Opie.  Opie.  Yeah.  I am a black ninja motherfucker.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Oh, wow.  Showed you.  And what does that mean?  It's a linger-longer.  I was supposed to be replayed.  Another thing that...  Oh, good one.  Pat Duffy reminder.  Pat came up with this?  Oh, Pat Duffy reminder.  Oh, something else.  Never mind.  His songs, they're going to replay on this channel, like, three more times, too. 
[03:44:00]  So, we're negotiating for a third song.  So, Erica, what are you willing to do for a third song?  Blow the staff?  Where are we at?  Jesus.  What the fuck?  Well, like Anthony said, you've got to start somewhere with negotiations.  So, now when we say a finger in the butt, it doesn't sound as outrageous.  No, a finger in the butt?  They're insane.  Sorry.  It's a joke.  Oh, God. 
[03:44:30]  Panties.  What are you willing to do for a third song?  It is the final...  Do you have any tricks up your sleeve?  I don't have any sleeves.  Can you shoot ping pong balls?  See, you're looking for stunts.  I don't think you're going to get, like, any kind of juggling or anything.  What, is a scene from Bear League we're going to reenact?  I think, uh...  Well...  I have no idea.  I don't know.  We've got California checking in, Columbia, Canada, Memphis, Sweden. 
[03:45:00]  Wow.  Canada, yeah.  Who doesn't want to impress somebody in Winnipeg?  Sean, what do you think for a third song?  What does she have to do?  I don't know.  That's up to...  He's pretty good with just leaving her at her own discretion.  Well, yeah, he's cool.  I would say since the final, uh, little common denominator here is the, uh, panties.  Right.  Um, you know.  I mean, and the fact that she's, uh, very well-kempt. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, she was smart enough to take her socks off.  That, we, we appreciate that.  That is good, yeah, yeah.  Usually they take their sneakers off and leave their ugly, dirty socks on.  It just looks silly.  You don't like that look?  Oh, we got, uh, somebody listening on the moon, so we're on the moon.  Yeah.  Think how big you'll be.  Buzz Aldrin's kid just called.  Well, we got cherry darts coming in.  Someone's suggesting we break out the old bottle rocket.  Somebody's suggesting the wiffle ball bat challenge. 
[03:46:00]  I don't think you're going to get a stunt before you get, you know.  Should we start placing stuff on the, on the table?  You mean, uh, pictures of presidents?  You know, stuff.  Can't really say what that would be, because that would be considered prostitution.  No, it's not.  It's prize money. 
[03:46:30]  Should I, should I tell the hookers that I'm on your prize is on the fucking bureau?  Like a box of Cracker Jacks.  Prize money.  Someone is suggesting a, uh, a fake orgasm.  Very interesting.  Or actually a real one.  A real one, we give up the channel from 11 to 12 to Sean Benjamin and whatever the fuck  he wants to play.  Really?  Get him on Letterman tonight.  Yeah, right? 
[03:47:00]  Yeah, it's like, we know CBS.  We can make that happen.  Yeah, right?  Let me think this out.  If, let's see, if Erica masturbates for us to completion, whatever time is left in the  hour, we give to Sean Benjamin.  That's a good deal.  Look, I'm no.  Nick's accepted it.  I'm no, uh, car dealer, but.  We're into barter programming at this point.  What's bartering for airtime?  That's my deal, Wade.  That was well laid out.  I thought I was at Camp David when you said that.  Well, let's just see if that's even something that would be in consideration. 
[03:47:30]  Eric, it's to you.  The ball's in your court.  So to speak.  Oh, my gosh.  I don't know.  Sean Benjamin's like, listen.  I can read your mind, Sean Benjamin.  Okay.  You're like, oh, for the love of God, do this.  No, he's not.  He's such a good guitarist.  Fucking broads that throw himself at him.  Yep.  Mm-hmm.  Hmm.  What's the, um, say that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I, um.  That's not a no. 
[03:48:00]  I don't.  I don't think I would do a real one.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  Well, don't.  Like, we know the difference.  You have nothing to apologize for.  Yeah.  Um, I guess then, are you, are, do you, have you done any acting at all?  No.  No.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I'm just thinking, because I'm kind of setting a scene here where she sits in that chair right  there, and, um.  What do you have in mind, Lee Straussberg? 
[03:48:30]  And just kind of, like, goes through the motions that you were doing something.  Maybe, maybe, uh, uh, Sean's away, you're lonely, he calls up, you get a little, you  know, excited about it, and, uh.  Bernie Kosar comes over.  And you just start maybe, you know, running your hands on yourself, let's say.  Just kind of, you know, feeling good, and, uh, and that way you could be sitting, and 
[03:49:00]  you could have your eyes shut, so you're more relaxed, and you're not going to topple  over.  Yeah.  You know.  Uh, turn the lights down.  And you have an Amish kid right over you the whole time.  By the way, uh, I know there's a lot of, Sean Benjamin, I know there's a lot of shenanigans  going on in the studio today, but, uh, a lot of people saying you have real talent.  Thank you.  A lot of people.  See that?  These listeners are quick to just beat the crap out of someone that comes on this show.  That's true.  I know.  They certainly are.  And perform.  But it's not happening today. 
[03:49:30]  Uh, let's say hi to Brad in Cleveland.  Brad.  What's up, boys?  Hey, I just got to get on real quick and tell Erica to do it for Ohio.  Make it proud.  Get in there.  Show the boys what Ohio's about.  Oh, thanks, baby.  Come on.  Do it for us.  Do it for Ohio.  It's worth 20 electoral votes.  It's a swing state.  Yeah, there you go.  Uh, let's say hi to hi, it looks like, in Arkansas.  Hi. 
[03:50:00]  Hi.  Hey.  Hey.  This guy needs to come out with a CD big time, man.  I would buy it.  I'm a big Maroon 5 fan.  This guy rocks good.  Thank you.  Have you been compared to Maroon 5 over the years?  Yeah.  A little bit, a little bit.  All right, let's say hi to Andy in Ohio.  Ohio checking in, man.  Uh, Andy.  Yes.  Do we need more light for the Paltalk cameras?  Yeah, a little bit.  I can barely see Anthony at this point.  They're getting angry.  Yeah, come on.  Turn the fucking light on.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  Andy, what's up? 
[03:50:30]  He hung up.  Well, I don't know.  What are you going to do, Erica?  Sean Benjamin has his guitar.  He wants to play a third song.  We have to take the, uh, the, uh, the hour programming off the table at this point.  Tony Soprano said, do a simulation.  Yeah.  What?  Jesus.  What are you, removing things already?  Oh, yeah.  We can't get a gun. 
[03:51:00]  That's not going to help when you haven't.  Well, you know, we got to be tough now.  We got to play a little.  Tough?  We got to play a little hardball.  I don't think.  We don't want to be, uh, looked at as softies here.  I don't think we've given, uh.  No, I think she's wearing a go, actually.  That's how I'm reading it.  It's a dangerous combination.  I'm practicing my Tony Soprano.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Hey, uh.  Oh, how the fuck are you?  I know you would do a fake orgasm, but can we bring in the, um, the Adam and Eve sex toys?  You are going from zero to 150. 
[03:51:30]  Really?  You're not even really.  At this point, at this point, you're just trying to get, like.  Iraq, what is it?  It's like being in a car.  Somebody keeps stepping on the gas.  Yeah.  I'm getting whiplash over here.  Iraq is thinking on the same page, because he brought some stuff in.  What the fuck did you bring in a rope?  What do you got, Iraq?  Well, there's.  You want to.  This is a love whip.  What the fuck is that?  Get what?  Get.  The girl's still got her panties on.  These are called sport cuffs.  It's got a fucking horse's tail.  It's like someone. 
[03:52:00]  It looks like Whoopi Goldberg.  Shade of snatch.  Hello.  It's a dangerous combination.  Hey, do we have a bar that we could hang her from a little bit?  Not off her feet, but just like have her.  Is this a Klan rally?  Are you crazy?  Just have her arms in the air in handcuffs.  What the fuck are you bringing in?  That's a goddamn six-inch butt plug.  Steve suggested a butt plug.  Well, of course Steve did for himself.  Look, if that butt plug can disappear, we'll give him the whole hour.  What is she now, a magician?  She's going to wave her hands and it'll disappear. 
[03:52:30]  Does this do anything for you?  The double-dong dildo.  What I need is a thing of goldens and some onions.  What else we got, Sam?  This is the Cyber Skin Creamsicle.  Yo, kids, get out of here.  Oh, we got the Cyber Skin Creamsicle.  This is terrific.  What does it do?  Well, it's a multi-speed massager with Cyber Skin Rigid Sleeve.  Right.  Rigid Sleeve?  What the fuck?  We also have the official SpectraGels anal stuffer toy. 
[03:53:00]  Those are great.  You get those at Rite Aid.  Oh, on the back there's a whole list of things.  It says, go ahead, try them all.  Oh, very nice.  And what's that cute, tiny little thing?  Unfortunately, it looks like me.  Really?  Oh, jeez.  Suctioned dildo.  I mean the color, not the size.  Oh, the suction dildo, you suction to the floor and then go to town, right?  Right.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Kill the wireless.  Kill the wireless?  Oh, you scared the hell out of me.  Oh, boy.  I thought the satellite was falling out of the sky. 
[03:53:30]  Kill that pot, please.  Kill that pot.  All right.  There we go.  Sean Benjamin wants to play another song, I'm telling you.  SeanBenjamin.com with a S-E-A-N spelling.  I would say, if she loses the panties, I say whatever they want.  Because that seems like, to me, because you're bringing out all these things, and that's just crazy talk.  You're fucking, your negotiating tactics are insane. 
[03:54:00]  Really, like you're Trump all of a sudden.  Yeah, yeah.  Look at what happened.  Look at the table.  It's packed now.  It's unbelievable.  It looks like the shit they find in a shallow grave.  And fucking Abu, fucking Buwadudum.  I don't know what I'm saying.  I'm fucking bunchy.  How do you guys do this every day for a living?  I know.  Fucking one day.  Insanity.  I'm going to go off the road on the way home to Western.  Yeah, well, we try, Nick.  But for some reason, a lot of people out there think we don't.  Which amazes me as well. 
[03:54:30]  Well, Eric, all right.  Panties for a song.  Sean Benjamin's sitting there.  Look, he got it.  He's got the guitar on his lap.  Ready to go.  Yeah, we've all seen it.  We're grown men.  Yeah, it's true.  Nick, calm down over there.  I thought you just got polio on me.  Give me an eye on the line, will you?  Hey, you motherfucker.  Eric, it's to you.  No.  Oh.  A no. 
[03:55:00]  Wait.  We've gotten our first no.  It was a no with a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, like a, there was  like a, like a, there was like kind of a thing there.  No.  A no dot.  Oh, wow.  No.  That's just an adamant.  Excuse me.  That was an adamant no.  That sounded like I was on a date.  How about if Duffy takes his pants off?  He'll do that.  Does that do anything for you?  Jesus.  Do you ever see a Taliban member?  I'll take my pants off right now.  Will that help?  Are there any, uh, keep your fucking pants on, Pat Duffy. 
[03:55:30]  They ought to close the deal.  I want to see them.  Uh, okay.  Maybe.  Are there any, um, ONA or Ron and Fez, uh, thongs laying around?  Would you be, uh, up to wearing one of the thongs?  That way, you know, because something tells me you're a little more interested in covering  up the front than the back.  Uh, you wear one of those.  She's got a thong on.  How about a John?  That's not a thong.  Turn around.  How about a John gambling t-shirt?  Turn around.  Let me see.  Turn around. 
[03:56:00]  Oh, fuck.  I'm working the cameras.  What the fuck do I see?  All right.  Ace that idea.  So we're already down to kind of the thong thing.  Would you go for a Curtis Sliwa hat?  Okay.  All right.  Well, I think we did pretty good today.  I don't think she's done.  That fucking, how long does this roofie take to kick in?  Jesus Christ.  You did ask for water, didn't you?  We slipped it to you an hour ago.  What the fuck?  I hope you didn't give it to E-Rock by accident. 
[03:56:30]  What, you drop a Tums in a roofie?  What the fuck?  Trying to get some business going over here.  Come on.  What the hell?  It's like we just started doing this.  E-Rock's getting drowsy there in the corner.  She said no.  She's wide awake.  Don't enforce the issue.  So then it gets, then it gets, then it just gets fucking creepy.  Well, let's look at some presidents.  What?  Oh, oh, oh, the last fucking hope.  The last hope.  Let's see what we got.  Hold on.  Maybe.  Hold on. 
[03:57:00]  How weird.  I get a thousand ones.  My pocket.  What, do you want to, let me see this.  You want to put a bumper sticker over a snatch?  What's wrong with you, E-Rock?  I got a little, I got a little bit of change here.  You good.  When did they put Don Imus on the 20?  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Well, are we, first of all, I want to say that you guys got me in trouble at work one  day because we were in a meeting, a really important meeting, and it's all about, you 
[03:57:30]  know, customer service and things like that.  And my supervisor kept saying, you want to wow the customer, and he kept saying it over  and over again, and I started laughing, and everyone looked at me.  It was awful.  Wow is, yeah, a lot different on this show than wowing the customer.  Maybe he did mean you want to wow the customer.  I would get a lot of accounts.  Keep those accounts where they belong.  Well, now, speaking of banking and money, I got a segway.  Here's what we do to make them feel more comfortable. 
[03:58:00]  Look, we all got money in our hands.  Nick's got a lot of cash out.  Everyone's got money out.  We line up single file in line, so she feels like she's at work.  I don't think there's anything wrong with, I don't know, having her, like, look at the  dollar bills to make sure they're not counterfeit.  Well, that's probably a good idea.  Why don't we pass that over?  Why don't you just take a look, take it for a little test drive, feel it around a little 
[03:58:30]  bit.  Let me know, let us know if that's counterfeit.  Is that real?  Yes.  Yeah.  How do you know it's real?  Would anything in that category change your mind about, you know, maybe just acing the  bottom portion of the bikini-like thing?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I'm telling. 
[03:59:00]  Hmm.  How much was the car repairs?  Three hundred.  There we go.  The heck goes, Rippy, looking up!  Dropping...  There we go.  There you go.  Now I'm done.  That's how that works.  I'll do something else.  You should do something else.  I don't know.  You don't have a penis, do you?  Jesus.  Who said that?  Hopi. 
[03:59:30]  Well, she's something else.  She's very protective of the panties.  Can I go pee-pee while she's mulling it?  Yeah.  Oh, that'll be great.  We'll get her to do it while he's away.  Nick will come in all pissed off.  Fuck.  Yeah, I've seen it all.  Except that shit.  I'm like Rockies, man.  I've never seen it all.  No, something else for the car repair money?  It can't be that, huh?  No?  No.  How'd you like your driveway repaved?  How's that septic tank working? 
[04:00:00]  Okay?  Okay.  Hmm.  Well.  Motel clerk in Washington stabbed in brutal attack.  Here we go.  We get footage.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, no.  You've got to be kidding me.  Wow.  Good footage.  Well, your rich Uncle Nick wants to buy you a bedroom set.  Look, she's fighting back.  She's an idiot. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, what a dummy.  Well.  Well.  No, I can't go for something else.  I was going for that.  Something else is something else.  So.  Sam.  Bring back the car repair money.  And he brings it back in a fluttering, flying away motion.  That's terrible.  Oh, it just flew back into Anthony's hands.  Yeah, Sam.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God. 
[04:01:00]  There you go.  There you go.  Jesus Christ.  Generous to a fault.  Oh, my God.  He's like a young Will Ferrell, isn't he?  Sam.  All right.  This is a little afro.  How about a little, here we go.  How about a fake orgasm?  Mm-hmm.  And then Sean Benjamin gets his song.  Let's fast forward the clock to four o'clock. 
[04:01:30]  Okay, look.  What do we need here?  All right.  If you go and get us coffee from Starbucks.  And I hear the theme for Jeopardy coming on.  All right.  So what are we doing?  Fake orgasm?  I can do that, yeah.  Yeah?  Well, don't go for the quick thing.  Like, got to go with the slow build-up.  Okay, how about you sit in the chair?  Yeah, sit in the chair. 
[04:02:00]  Sit in the chair.  Yeah.  Yeah, that one, right.  Not that one.  Yeah.  Lean back in that chair.  Just pretend it's Thanksgiving.  You're in the den.  Your family.  All right, we're putting her in a chair.  She's naked.  Like, don't freak out on me.  Try to find the right one.  There we go.  Stuffy, handcuff her hands to the...  I'd love to.  Jesus, Pat.  What?  Don't creep her out.  I want to hurt her.  Oh.  Jesus.  That fucking beard is really fucking... 
[04:02:30]  It looks like the one on the bearded lady at the circus.  E-Rock, any suggestions?  I would say that...  Oh, I'm not E-Rock.  Shit.  E-Rock, any suggestions?  Can Pal Talk can see her?  Of course.  All right, push the chair back.  Get her comfortable.  Is Pal Talk like PayPal?  Are those two different things?  Two different things, yeah.  Doesn't the chair go back?  Yeah, let her recline.  All right. 
[04:03:00]  Whoa.  All right.  All right.  She's reclined.  All right.  Now, see, there's a lot of, which I understand, a lot of shyness going on there in the chair.  I'm sorry.  It's...  No, no, no.  It's...  Okay.  Oh, by the way, if the orgasm, the fake orgasm, isn't good, Sean Benjamin...  Oh.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Okay, I fake it a lot.  I'm just...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, that had a hurt. 
[04:03:30]  That was so special.  No, Sean, don't give a fuck.  Sean's a musician.  He's got the type of music the young broads love.  That's right.  Can't hurt this kid.  That's why the love song's from Sean Benjamin.  He just wants to play his next song.  He doesn't give me shit.  Okay.  I think what we're looking for is some audio and visual acting.  Yeah.  We're multimedia these days.  So what you got to do is kind of, you know, sprawl yourself out on the chair a little bit.  Like you were just home alone, all natural, and... 
[04:04:00]  Pretend that's all of a stone holding the mic.  And not all of a twist.  And just kind of, you know, kind of get into it, I guess.  Whatever it takes.  All right, close your eyes.  Here we go.  Yeah, closing your eyes would probably be best.  Sean Benjamin's girlfriend.  Okay, be quiet.  You play boo, Opie.  I shoot you.  And action.  Look at me. 
[04:04:30]  Okay.  Okay.  You, you're...  All right, look.  Look, asshole.  What?  That's just the sound of what happened out there to some guy. 
[04:05:00]  He fell over.  That's all.  I'm just trying to enhance the radio experience for everybody.  Look, don't let him distract you.  It was a high-tech cock block.  The audience is very into that.  All right.  I was buying it.  Yeah.  All right, let's start over.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[04:05:30]  Oh.  Oh. 
[04:06:00]  What time's the Mets game? 
[04:06:30]  Well.  Great acting, great singing.  That was a talented couple.  Yes.  Very nice.  Let's say hi to Bronx Johnny.  Bronx Johnny.  Hey, what's up, Benovi?  What's up, sir?  I'd like to pitch in $200 for a queef.  A queef.  And Bronx Johnny doesn't make much money, so this is very special.  $200, queef.  Do you queef? 
[04:07:00]  And I'll give it a pound of Chiba Pet, if you know what I mean.  Chiba Pet.  Jesus Christ.  A Chiba Pet.  We had a guy that has a recording studio, but I think he hung up.  Oh, shit.  I can get one of those.  They got a bunch of those in Harlem.  $200, a pound of Chiba Pet, and a studio.  Erica, do you queef?  Not intentionally.  A lot of girls can't do that on demand.  Right.  You know?  For $200, I think they can. 
[04:07:30]  Fucking Johnny.  Money's answering everything.  No kidding.  Let's see.  Thanks, Johnny.  We'll talk to you soon.  Catch you later.  All right, peace.  Let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  We got a recording studio.  She loses her panties.  I'll do a three-song demo.  Wow.  Sean's like, whatever.  Why the whatever, Sean?  You can be honest.  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, because it's not really so much the recording studio I need. 
[04:08:00]  It's the, like, the management contract.  Distribution.  I can get my stuff recorded.  I have a digital recorder in the bag, I think, that we're traveling with.  Yeah, but that was Sean Combs.  All right.  I think Sean Benjamin deserves another song.  Erica was a trooper today.  Right?  Great job.  He should stay in New York.  He can act.  He can sing.  I mean, SeanBenjamin.com.  S-E-A-N.  And SeanBenjamin on MySpace?  Yeah.  MySpace.com slash SeanBenjamin.  Yeah, we don't need all that anymore. 
[04:08:30]  We're all in the MySpace world.  You just say SeanBenjamin on MySpace.  You're going to go back to Philly and end up playing down the flats.  You don't want to do that.  Stay.  All right.  One more song from Sean Benjamin.  Where's the gig tonight again?  It's at the Alphabet Lounge in the East Village.  It's 104 Avenue C.  I think it's Avenue C and 7th or something.  Okay.  Very good.  Another song from Sean Benjamin.  I wish this was a little more in tune, but it's okay. 
[04:09:00]  We'll just work with it.  Hey, it's down on San Subleed.  Got the kind of look that can drive me crazy when you're flashing in Monday.  Line aside.  I want to make it's night or night.  I'm in a little bit of a mood for two.  It's about if somebody helped this come true.  Well, let me rule this out for you.  What we do.  Oh, and I sit down.  I like to get my hands on. 
[04:09:30]  Do anybody see that girl?  I feel like that she wants to stick in a hood.  Let me do anybody see that girl.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah.  I control it.  Let me do anybody see that girl.  And when she talks, she's making love for me.  Do anybody see that girl?  Oh, no.  Do anybody see that lady?  It's a love in the matter that I love to lust.  But girl's got me baffling like, what's the fuss? 
[04:10:00]  I'm on a new kind of high.  And it feels all right.  We've been picking up chicks in a 216.  The girls in the burg when we hit the pit.  You want to get down now?  In Cap Town, let's get down.  Oh, I sit down.  I like to get my hands on.  Anybody see that girl?  The way that she walks is sticking a hood to me.  Do anybody see that girl?  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah.  I control it.  Let me do anybody see that girl. 
[04:10:30]  And when she talks, she's making love for me.  Do anybody see that girl?  Oh, no.  Do anybody see that lady?  Do anybody see that girl?  Anybody?  Anybody?  Anybody?  Chill.  Nice.  Chill.  Bravo.  Well done. 
[04:11:00]  Just getting one complaint.  The songs just aren't as catchy without Full Frontal.  Right.  It just sounds catchy.  That was Coke Logic.  Very funny Coke Logic.  All right.  What else can we do?  I mean, bravo.  You guys made the XM portion of the show rock today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Very nice.  SeanBenjamin.com.  We're tired now.  Yeah.  Line of the day is brought to you by AshleyMadison.com.  If you're into some of that cheating, there's a website for cheaters, Nick. 
[04:11:30]  What are you directing that to me for?  I'm too fucking tired and alter cheaters.  I wasn't going there.  I'm just like getting you involved in the conversation.  Oh, you mean you go there to cheat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You find other like-minded people.  That's horrible.  What's this world coming to?  Set it up.  It's horrid.  The company has no problem with us promoting this.  Oh, yeah.  No, I've heard of it.  It's great.  This is an actual sponsor of the show. 
[04:12:00]  No, Jim Norton talks about all the time.  AshleyMadison.com.  If you're looking for a little something on the side and don't want to get caught, do yourself  a favor and check out AshleyMadison.com.  All right?  Right.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  The tooth had hair on it.  Oh, it was horrid.  I was like, no, this isn't getting sexy.  One of those, a tooth that was supposed to be another body part, but it's grown out of  your-grew into a tooth.  It's grown out of your elbow.  Oh, thanks, boys. 
[04:12:30]  Oh, if she loses, I'm for sure.  Oh, that's not a bad idea.  Shane, Tennessee, what's up?  I was going to say, I hope you've got one more thing.  She could get, if she takes her panties off, you can get her boyfriend a gig at F.H.  Riley's.  F.H.  Riley's in the heart of Huntington Village, 400 New York Avenue.  Oh, yeah.  This place holds at least 150 people.  Thank you, man.  I think we're going to do something with Sean Benjamin down the road when it makes sense.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Unfortunately, it was not a hint of moisture in there, so we had to kind of like pour water 
[04:13:00]  over it.  Had to activate it.  We had to activate it.  It was like sea monkeys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love the sea monkeys.  What's the search for that video again?  Homeless underwear mustache.  Yeah.  Homeless underwear mustache on YouTube if you want to see what we did with Tippy Tom yesterday.  A lot of Tippy Tom videos will be up on all the familiar sites during the weekend.  And hopefully, one guy said, if the videos of Erica aren't online by the time he gets 
[04:13:30]  off of work, he's going down to your gig, Sean, and he's burning down the place with  you in it.  Right.  So we've got to get those videos up immediately.  That's good publicity, though.  That's not bad, right?  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  I got us out the other day.  Really?  Yeah.  What'd you say?  I said, I'm sorry.  I have a boyfriend.  And he said, I'd like to make a deposit in your ass. 
[04:14:00]  Nick DiPaolo, nickdip.com, playing a gig at some really dumb comedy club.  No!  No, good club.  Brand new club.  The club is good.  The name is stupid, right?  Well, yeah.  They have to fix the second part of the thing.  It's a comedy shop at 8.15.  So you're going to be performing at 8.15 at the comedy shop.  Nick DiPaolo.  That's good.  That's the address, but it's in Haskell.  Haskell, New Jersey, next Friday and Saturday, the 18th and 19th. 
[04:14:30]  Am I going to believe that?  I'm looking forward to it.  Jersey is very good to me.  Wait, 8.15, isn't that August 15th, though?  No.  I'm really confused.  What happened?  I understand.  You're really going to confuse my...  Go to nickdip.com.  All the info's up there, right?  All the info's right there.  Absolutely.  Video blog?  Yeah.  And we have Nick DiPaolo Afghans that I've been knitting in my basement.  $79.95.  And what else?  Erica's really uncomfortable.  Can she put her clothes back on?  No? 
[04:15:00]  Okay.  Another runner-up line of the day.  He likes to brag about being related to Thomas Jefferson.  Then you look at him, you're like, eh, that's from the side where he's banging slave  girls.  One of those nights where Tom had to go back to the room and pick cotton out of his pubes.  What do you call him, Tom?  I like that.  Tom.  Tom Jefferson.  That's what his buddies called him.  Hey, Tommy, what the fuck?  It's like Chuck Heston.  Chuck Heston.  Busy weekend for you?  Mm.  Yeah.  I'll tell you all about it Monday. 
[04:15:30]  You got an adventure planned?  Yeah, I guess so.  A little bit.  It's not like I'm going on safari.  But are you taking flights?  No.  I will not be flying in an airplane this weekend.  Will somebody else be flying in an airplane?  What would I say that for?  I said I won't be flying in an airplane.  Good pernt.  Good pernt.  Line of the day, Tom?  Yes.  AshleyMadison.com. 
[04:16:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  I like a little patch or something down there.  It's like a tit with no nipples.  Something that'll let you know where you are.  Yeah, exactly.  It's pitch black in there.  Don't be licking your fucking heel.  Hello.  I need something. 
[04:16:30]  Give me a sign.  Some kind of sign.  You need something to help you direct your attention, right?  A swastika or a fucking Mets logo.  Something.  Help me out.  Come on, you fucker to my bitch.  A little tippy to cap off the line of the day.  Yeah, I like that clip.  That's a good one.  Need a little something down there.  Yeah, you do.  Bill Cade Philly.  Helicopter at?  No, I don't think there's a helicopter this weekend.  No.  No, I shan't be taking to the air. 
[04:17:00]  It's on the ground.  It's a submarine.  What the fuck are you doing?  We've run out of steam.  Showing Benjamin, it was a pleasure, my friend.  Thank you, guys.  You got something.  Good luck trying to...  It certainly does it.  Good luck trying to figure out how to make something out of it.  That's the biggest challenge these days.  Yeah, that's the hard part.  You could have talent, but...  Eh.  What am I trying to do?  Preach?  Shut the fuck up, Anthony. 
[04:17:30]  Anthony had a band once.  Yep.  Look where I am now.  They did very well in Europe for a little while.  You talking about Rotgut?  Yes.  Rotgut.  Look where Anthony is now.  50,000 square foot house in Long Island.  Looking at your naked girlfriend.  Yep.  Girls using fence posts to get off now?  I know.  What the fuck is that butt plug?  Who's using that?  It's something you kill a vampire with.  What the fuck is that?  That has nothing to do with a girl, by the way. 
[04:18:00]  That has nothing to do with a girl.  It's like my agent's nose.  Fuck, I forgot this is radio.  Ah, shit.  People know what a butt plug looks like.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is that what that is?  That's the way Steve.  Oh, that's a butt plug?  Yeah, it's a butt plug.  Jesus Christ.  You really want that in there.  It's like a fucking wall molly.  Yeah.  Hang a fucking picture on it.  Does it have to be so wide and then get so narrow?  Yeah.  It's like a doorknob to a haunted house. 
[04:18:30]  It is.  Jay from Florida wants to know if you're going to be picking up girls in the 216 this weekend.  Oh.  Or do you say 216?  The 216.  That's right.  We'll be picking up chicks in the 216 this weekend.  What's that?  Albany?  It's Cleveland.  The fucking guy wrote.  I was going to say.  It sounded like Cleveland.  There's other area codes.  All over the country. 
[04:19:00]  You got to 914, yo.  Kicking it up in Westchester County.  Counties.  There's other area codes in the Cleveland area.  Yeah.  I'm heading to the 978 to visit my parents.  It's a little north of Bosnia.  That's such a homey thing to do.  Just address your place you're going by the fucking area code.  Where?  What?  Did they change it?  I got lost.  They changed 516 to 631 and now I have no idea where I'm going.  Where does my mother live? 
[04:19:30]  Is this anything we can say filler to keep her naked in a chair?  Dude, are you signed with STF Records?  FTF.  It's a...  That's what?  It's an indie label out of Kent, which is where Kent State University is.  It's right by Cleveland.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm doing a recording with them, but it's not a major label.  What we're going to try to do is get it picked up by a major label.  Yeah, but you know, that's a great start, man.  What's the name of the record company?  FTF. 
[04:20:00]  Oh, FTF.  All right.  This guy wrote STF.  He said Google them.  You'll see that he's signed to FTF Records.  FTF.  It's like out of Kent, Akron area.  But that's all...  Yeah, but then...  It's a flower company.  It'll go from there, man.  Oh, yeah.  We try to get picked up by something else.  Cool.  You guys were a lot of fun.  Thanks for coming by.  Thank you.  No pictures, no autographs.  We got to go home.  All right.  See you later.  Take news.  From the Far East of Long Island comes a new breed of hero.  This is Greg Opie Hughes.  A legend. 
[04:20:30]  I'm a mess.  An uncommon warrior.  Na, na, na, na, na.  His skin is the color of converted rice.  That's right.  His blonde locks flow like morning sun through a wheat field.  Way to know your audience.  His shrouds are as dark as his tortured soul.  I'm a black ninja, fuck face!  In a race against time, the black ninja challenges his deadliest foe.  Good old cobra back.  He's in a mansion, and he has a bunch of ghetto chicks fighting for his love. 
[04:21:00]  Training daily in his minimalist Upper East Side dojo.  I just whack it and whack it and whack it.  Accompanied by a mayonnaise-slurping apprentice, a boy trapped inside the body of a man.  What's wrong, Eric?  My cross is burning so bad.  Ew, ew!  On a mission to find the thief who stole the XM unit out of his car.  Holy shit!  Now I'm mad.  A fearless warrior who refuses to back down.  We're all fucked.  A master of disguise blending into his surroundings.  Say, anybody seen that ninja? 
[04:21:30]  Right here, you asshole!  No one can escape the wrath of the black ninja.  Coming soon to a dojo in Jersey.  Jersey?  I live in Jersey.  I'm a goddamn black ninja.  Bring it on. </pre>
