<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing bafflement and suspicion over a sudden deluge of eight pre-written radio bits from their production team.  They aggressively questioned Troy and Sam, both present in the studio, about the inexplicable influx of material.  The production team's vague explanations, claiming they were simply "going ham," only fueled the hosts' suspicions.  This led to a sarcastic digression about a rival morning show, "the dumb morning mash-up," their excessive vacation time, and which members (Stanley T. receiving praise, Nicole criticism) the hosts would retain if they were in charge.  The hosts then dissected the new bits, particularly a recurring "visual joke on the radio" segment featuring graphic descriptions of cartoons and adult magazine imagery. A Louis C.K. story, embellished with sound effects by the production team, became a focal point of their comedic criticism. The segment concluded with tangents about their dislike of *Caillou*, the Brooklyn Nets' branding, and Patrice O'Neal's fashion sense, with a discussion about the habit of wearing expensive sneakers only once. The underlying theme remained their investigation into the mystery of the extra bits.

The show continued with a discussion about potential staff raises and bonuses, marked by speculation about management's lack of transparency and accusations of broken promises. This transitioned into a conversation about sneakers, followed by a lengthy, humorous exploration of Rich Voss's personal life, including marital troubles and anecdotes about his sex life, culminating in a story involving a Powerade bottle as a sex toy.  This spurred a tangential discussion about the unexpected sexual applications of everyday objects. The hosts then discussed a listener gift:  Christmas ornaments featuring a Hitler head and swastikas.  Upcoming guests David Tell, Rich Voss, and Jacob Tomsky ("Heads in Beds") were announced, along with Yoko Ono's later appearance. The segment included a blunt and critical discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, referencing a recent bus bombing in Tel Aviv, and Jim Norton's upcoming Thanksgiving plans with his wealthy sister.  The hosts also reminisced over old show photos from Mulcahy's, mentioning "E-Rock," and a story about Jim Norton receiving oral sex on a bus.  Rich Voss then promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.

The next segment opened with a listener's complaint about TSA agents stealing sunglasses and a harness from his golf bag at Newark.  This segued into complaints about airline experiences (United, Southwest, and a nostalgic mention of People's Express), followed by criticisms of the Sirius XM merger. A graphic newspaper image depicting a dragged body in Gaza sparked a lengthy, heated discussion about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, involving the hosts, a caller named Rich (offering historical context and perspectives on Hamas and Iran), and further heated exchanges with callers Joe and Kevin, involving offensive language and accusations against Obama’s foreign policy. A caller, David (later revealed to be in Georgia, not Israel), offered a contrasting on-the-ground perspective. Jacob Tomsky, author of "Heads in Beds," briefly discussed his book and hotel experiences. The segment concluded with a humorous anecdote about Rich's unsuccessful attempt to use a cold beverage container intimately with his wife, Bonnie (who briefly spoke on the phone).  Studio guests during this segment included Dave Attell, Jim Norton, and Sam Roberts.

A significant portion of the broadcast featured a conversation with Jacob Tomsky, promoting his book "Heads in Beds."  The discussion covered various aspects of hotel life, including the notoriously bad Carter Hotel, tips and tricks for manipulating hotel staff (faking reservations, complaining about smoke), hotel policies (overbooking, smoking, toiletries), unsanitary conditions (minibar glasses, bedding), strange guest requests (a celebrity's outlandish demands), hotel mishaps (self-harm, theft), bed bugs, haunted hotels, and the inadequacies of room service.  The conversation was punctuated with vulgar and sexually suggestive language and jokes; one host attempted (and failed) to use Tomsky’s methods for an early check-in.

The final segment continued the discussion of hotel experiences, including anecdotes about bed bugs, a hypothetical question about suicide charges, and cost-cutting strategies. Rich described making coffee with a clothes steamer.  The hosts and guests (including Tomsky, Rich Voss, and David Tell) shared various hotel experiences, including a near-fire evacuation, encounters with prostitutes, problems with in-room safes, and a guest’s lucky gambling streak at the Borgata.  They discussed the worst types of travelers, specifically criticizing professional athletes for their cheapness and rudeness, along with "black card" holders and certain nationalities.  Tomsky, Voss, and Tell promoted their respective projects (book signings, stand-up shows, podcasts).  The show ended with announcements about an upcoming "best of" special hosted by Chip.  The overall tone remained irreverent, profane, and sexually suggestive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yee! Good morning, everyone!  Yabba-dabba-doo!  Alright!  Live radio! Yay!  What?  We're one of the only live shows here today.  I don't get it.  Because we just, for some reason, just don't get vacation like everyone else.  What happened?  I don't know, man.  Even the dumb morning mash-up gets the whole week off.  The dumb morning mash-up. 
[00:00:30]  The dumb morning mash-up.  They don't even work to begin with, and then they get a week off around Thanksgiving?  Yeah.  That's their deal, but my point is,  how many weeks vacation do they got that they can just throw one away around Thanksgiving?  And take Thanksgiving.  How hard is it to play the hits that you gotta take a week off?  Five guys playing the hits, and they take a week off.  Holy shit, right?  I would so fire them if I was the new owners. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, man.  I'm gonna make my list for the new owners, that's for sure.  Five guys playing the hits.  Get rid of those fucking guys.  Take the five people, turn it into one guy, save a lot of money right there.  Isn't the mash-up one of the few shows that we're on good terms with?  Yeah, that's why I'm being nice.  You just requested that they were fired.  No, I don't want the show to go away.  I just want it to go from five to one.  Who's the one last?  I think the concept for the show is very, very good.  What, playing the hits?  I just don't think you need five guys doing it.  So who's left?  See, if I wasn't on good terms with those guys, I would say fucking wipe out the entire fucking show. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, but you're gonna keep one.  Oh, absolutely.  We all know which one, too, so I don't have to say it.  I don't.  Yeah.  Who's that?  The one who likes this.  No, I'd keep the black guy.  Stanley T?  Stanley T!  Why, what's he up to?  I just like the Stanley T.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he keeps it real.  Like, get rid of the rest of them easily.  He keeps it real?  He keeps it real, yo. 
[00:02:00]  What's that?  Huh?  How does one keep things real?  He just keeps it real, man.  Period.  That's all you need to know.  I'd probably keep Nicole first.  Nah, man.  To attract it to her.  She's a distraction, and she's got issues that she should go take care of.  She definitely does.  The little dog.  Yeah.  The dog and all that should go.  Keep the dog.  She can do the show with the dog.  Why do we have, like, 18 bits in front of us today?  Look at this.  They're coming in.  I know.  It's crazy.  We got bits.  I got a couple more over here if you like them. 
[00:02:30]  Are you kidding?  No.  What's going on?  I know this.  I know.  You don't even have to tell me.  There's something up.  What is it?  Something's afoot.  Something's afoot.  Troy may have been in the lab.  There's eight bits in front of us.  Why?  Because Troy asked me to increase.  I mean, we're great and all, but we're not that great where you could come up with eight bits like that.  You guys are like Simon and Garfunkel.  Oh, I think the show is good enough to come up with bits instantly.  Oh.  You want a bit?  We come up with it.  You want a bit real quick? 
[00:03:00]  Go ahead.  Hey, let's just do the paper crinkling routine.  Guess what paper this is.  Taking your calls.  Boom.  You didn't even crinkle it.  I hit the mic with it.  I'm going to bet that the real story is way better.  Well, I mean, Troy's the production guy.  We've been around way too long to know that there's a reason why we have eight bits in front of us.  This doesn't just come, you know, appear out of the blue.  Out of the fucking blue.  Why do we have eight bits in front of us?  Troy's the production guy.  Is he here? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah, he's here.  I saw him walk in.  He'll tell me.  Yesterday he said, I want to kill it.  No, no, no.  No one kills it right before the holiday.  That's what he said.  He said he wants to go ham.  Troy, this fucking worm over here will not give me the real answer.  So why do I have eight bits in front of me?  Just on fire right now.  No, no.  No, something's up, you asshole.  I told you, dude, we're on fire right now as a team.  I wish literally.  Yeah, exactly.  We're killing it.  No, something's up.  What's up, Troy?  No, we're just, we're going, we're going ham.  You're another guy that keeps it real, so let's go. 
[00:04:00]  What's the real deal here?  Hopi, the truth is we're going ham in this motherfucker.  What's up, man?  Good for you, dude.  We just want to end the year strong.  I mean, and I got probably about like seven more on tap right now that I'm going to try to pound out today.  My pen was on fire yesterday.  Troy's fingers were all over the Pro Tools going crazy.  What were you told?  Nothing.  No, it's all good, man.  I've been at this a long time.  What were you told?  There's no way all of a sudden you guys come up with eight bits in one day.  Something changed yesterday.  What were you told?  Why do we have to be told anything, man?  We're just trying to end 2012 with a bang. 
[00:04:30]  What were you told?  I'll give you what you need.  What were you told?  Oh, that kind.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, not quite that, yeah.  Yeah, we're just on fire, man.  That's what it is.  Why are you guys scared?  Something changed yesterday.  No, we're not scared.  We're just excited to be...  There's a Louis C.K. boating story.  That's a good one.  There's a visual jokes on the radio bit.  There's an Elmo bit.  There's a fucking San Francisco band's public nudity bit.  A lot of repurposing, it seems.  Wow.  And there was another bit. 
[00:05:00]  I've got a Black Keys bit, too.  I don't think you played it.  The Black Keys bit is over here.  And then you've got another seven, you're saying.  And some of them are taking a turn for the bizarre, but still, we're just pumping them  out.  Yeah.  Like, we're getting a little weird with a few of them, but it's, you know, we're getting  them done quick is the thing.  The turnaround time is ridiculous.  You know, there's our...  Remember your conversation about fishes yesterday?  Not at all.  No.  Well, there you will, because there's something in the works.  All right, what's going on?  Yeah.  Why don't we just replay the show?  Why are you guys doing bits like that? 
[00:05:30]  Remember Jim's thing about the hostess cakes?  Yeah.  There's something in the works.  Oh, where he made up the treats?  Oh, yeah, there's something in the works.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  And it's killer, right?  But why...  Fuck yeah, dude.  Good.  Why all of a sudden?  No, I just...  We just want to shoot some fireballs at you guys before the end of the year, you know?  We're feeling good.  Like, why does it always have to be something, Opie?  Why can't it just be like, hey...  Because it's Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's positivity.  It's got to be something.  No, there isn't.  We're trying to be positive.  We're trying to end the year with a bang.  I will bet money that you guys were told something stupid.  What?  What?  Did you guys... 
[00:06:00]  Did either of you guys meet with or talk to either Gary, Rob, or Steve yesterday?  Well, yeah.  We had a meeting.  Oh.  Oh, you did have a meeting.  Yeah, but nothing was said in that meeting.  I mean...  Something was said, though, that is making you come up with all these bits.  Well, for the record, we've been going ham for about a week and a half.  So it wasn't just yesterday.  It's just now it's really...  It's starting to culminate now, and we're going to be a house on fire.  What lie did they tell you?  Come on.  Then we can move on with the show.  What lie did they tell you?  But why does it always have to be a lie or anything like that?  Why can't it just be like, hey, you know, we're just...  Past performance? 
[00:06:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Past performance.  Well...  Not your performance.  I'm just saying their performance.  Their past performance has dictated that there's a lot of lies in this place.  I just don't understand why it has to be a problem that we would just want to end the  year strong and with a bang, you know?  And it's like, we're talking about all these bits.  When are we going to play some of these motherfuckers?  You know what I mean?  Oh, man.  What are you guys scared of?  Why can't you tell me the truth?  Huh?  What?  What?  Troy, man.  You keep it real.  I am keeping it real.  Fuck this worm over here.  Fucking, it's me and you, brother.  What's going on? 
[00:07:00]  Tell me what happened.  You know, just...  Just trying to end it positive, you know what I mean?  Did you hear those Roland and E-Rock intros?  I'm telling you.  We've been on fire.  Yeah, I'm actually proud of those.  This turned out good, right?  Yeah, they were very good.  And then, uh...  Someone said you guys don't do enough production.  Is that it?  Well, I mean, you know, you could always amp it up.  You know what I mean?  That's, uh...  Were you told...  What is it suggested that you amp up production?  Well, it's always been suggested.  It's always been suggested that we deliver as much volume as we can.  Was it suggested that you amp it up and then not discuss the fact that it was said on the air? 
[00:07:30]  Well, you know, management really doesn't like anything discussed on the air, so...  Yeah.  So it's like, you know, it's fine.  Why is everyone looking around?  This is where it gets uncomfortable?  No.  Look at me.  I'm fucking great.  Yeah.  Those guys need to know that'll never change.  We will always talk about that.  Yeah.  That's part of the gig.  Yeah.  To the last day we broadcast this show, we'll always do that.  That'll never change.  Right.  Well, I mean, just plan on a lot of good production coming your way. 
[00:08:00]  I mean, that's all I really have to say right now.  Let's plan on it.  All right.  Let's plan on it.  I will get to the bottom of this.  You guys will be able to do less radio for the rest of the year.  All I want to know is, were you promised anything to do this?  That's where my suspicion is.  No.  It's going to be looked at positively, I would think.  I would think it would be.  I think that it would be looked at as a positive thing that we're delivering a lot of production  to you.  I'm thinking there might be something in it for you boys if you work even harder. 
[00:08:30]  Is that the lie they're telling you this time?  Well, I mean, you know that there's never any promises made.  I mean, you know that.  I mean, that's, you know.  We're not going to get to that.  It's not like a direct sort of, if you do this, then you will get that type of thing.  That's not the way it works.  No.  That's not the way it works.  But it's like, if we come to a conclusion that, you know what, if we've got to kill  it, we've got to kill it, and then the results will show, then that's what we're going to  do.  Yeah.  And our goal is really to just have, maybe even towards the end of the year, just a 
[00:09:00]  show where you guys don't even talk.  You can just play all of our bits.  Brand new bits.  Yeah.  No, we'll play the bits if you want.  It'll be a live show, but it'll be all bits.  Nice.  Yeah.  We're not going to get the answer now, but I will get the answer.  Yeah, some ways.  I always get the answer.  Well, I don't know why you...  I don't know why Troy's not keeping it real this time.  He's keeping it real.  I always keep it real, man.  Real.  I'm giving you fireballs.  That's what I'm doing.  Like Stanley?  Stanley keeps it real, and I thought Troy kept it real, but I guess not.  But why not just sit there and be like, oh, this is great. 
[00:09:30]  I got all these bits.  Because there's something going on.  It's so obvious.  Yeah, there is something going on.  This place is a house on fire right now.  Oh, boy.  I kind of feel like, honestly, I'm just wasting my time in the studio here talking to you guys when  I could be doing production bits right now.  More bits.  Unless we make a bit out of this.  We could.  Someone said that you need to be on fire.  Someone said...  Who used the term on fire in management recently?  No, no, no.  They don't use those.  They're not hip.  No.  No.  No, no, no. 
[00:10:00]  What are you laughing at?  Why is Troy laughing, Sam?  Because Sam makes all these dumb faces.  I can't...  That's just his face.  Yeah, that's just his face.  All right.  So I'm going to go get back to work, guys.  Do you believe the lies they're telling you?  I mean, I've been here a long time that I don't believe anything.  So...  All right.  All right.  See, now we're getting to it.  See, you just broke down a little bit.  So you weren't told something.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, I've been told a lot of things in the seven years I've been here.  How about yesterday at the meeting?  Uh, I think the quote was, let's make this as fast as we can so we can get out of here. 
[00:10:30]  So...  Yeah, what's that?  Who said that?  Uh, management.  Okay.  So they were just...  They had a lot of stuff going on.  Well, let's get on their part.  Yeah, no, they had a lot of stuff going on.  What's the lot of stuff they have going on?  Well, they run like 50, 60 music channels.  Those channels are a waste of time.  Well...  I mean, it's a TV channel.  I like some of them in the bathroom.  Huh?  Yeah.  I like 80s on 8 in the bathroom.  It's kind of nice hearing Jessie's Girl when you're taking a piss.  Exactly.  Oh, I thought you meant the ages.  The genre is the genre.  It's the easiest shit to do in radio. 
[00:11:00]  If, and I say if, satellite radio is going to survive, it's going to be shows like ours.  Right.  That stand out.  Not dumb music channels.  No one gives a fuck about music channels anymore.  They really don't.  It's because they don't have bits.  Ugh, forget it.  You guys are fucking wimps.  I mean, it's just...  Wimps?  I don't know why we have to be wimps just because we're delivering...  Because something was told to you.  It's amazing the attitude on this show that, like, we start delivering content and we get  called wimps for it.  It's like, I thought we were doing something positive, something you guys would like. 
[00:11:30]  Very suspicious.  You don't want bits?  Usually there's a bit that comes in every day, every other day, there's five or six in  front of me and another seven in his studio.  You don't want to?  And I'm not supposed to question that.  You don't want to?  That means something has changed.  That's all.  Is that what you're saying?  You don't want them, though?  We'll keep them for ourselves.  I want to play all of them.  Okay.  All right.  Well, then fair enough.  Which one do you want to play first?  I say visual jokes on the radio.  Really?  Yeah.  Is that your strongest one?  I like it.  That's your opener?  I don't know if that's the strongest one, but it's a good one.  It's good.  Yeah.  All right.  One of many, many bits that were handed in today. 
[00:12:00]  In conjunction with some old porno magazine, this is a visual joke on the radio.  I remember a joke, comic little picture I saw, and it was a woman.  She's laying in bed, and she's got a giant fishtail hanging out of her pussy, and the husband's  coming in, and he's got his dick hanging out, and the bubble over her head said, not  tonight, dear.  I have a haddock.  In conjunction with some old porno magazine, that was a visual joke on the radio. 
[00:12:30]  It's a good fucking line.  It's a good radio, but it didn't need its own bits.  No.  See, Anthony delivered.  Why did that need its own bits?  I'll tell you why.  I'm going to tell you why.  Anthony delivered a fucking great line, as he always does, and then instead of that line  just being lost in that day's show, we're repurposing, and it will live forever.  What did these guys have to do?  Live forever.  Somebody said live forever.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm just giving you... 
[00:13:00]  No.  You don't like visual jokes on the radio?  We got two more, like literally right here.  Wait, so you guys had a meeting, but they were too busy, so they couldn't do the meeting  with you guys?  No, we did the meeting.  Everything was fine.  It was just a normal meeting.  It wasn't anything...  Nothing really was said.  It was just...  They could focus 2% on music channels and 98% on this channel.  Well, that's not going to happen.  Of course not.  But...  I got two more visual jokes on the radio.  I thought we just...  Two more visual jokes on the radio.  Are we adding that to the pile?  Yeah, I thought we were going to do it like a series.  Because it was like, instead of doing one bit with the three visual jokes... 
[00:13:30]  I'll add them to the pile now.  We'll do three bits.  Okay.  Now I got...  I played one.  I got six more here, and then you got another seven in the...  In the works right now.  In the works?  Yeah.  You want to continue with the visual jokes on the radio thing?  Yeah.  I mean, I got a good laugh, so let's keep going with it.  Yeah.  All right.  Fair enough, sir.  In conjunction with some old porno magazine, this is a visual joke on the radio. 
[00:14:00]  I remember a cartoon...  I think I've said this one before, the one where Superman's sitting in a chair, and he's  fucking looking up, and there's a girl kneeling in front of him, and her head is in the ceiling  with cum dripping out of her mouth.  I blew her head off.  In conjunction with some old porno magazine, that was a visual joke on the radio.  Even though I have to correct the boys on both counts...  Yeah.  ...those aren't necessarily visual jokes on the radio.  No, they're jokes.  They're really not.  Yeah, those are jokes that translate through auditory means. 
[00:14:30]  A visual joke on the radio would be like, I'm talking, and I'm looking over here at Satch  from the Bowery Boys, and I'd be like, why would you say that?  Yeah, yeah.  And they'd be like, oh, because Anthony has a hat on that's a baseball cap.  A visual joke on the radio would be describing something that's lost in translation.  They'd go like this, like, watch, everybody, all the listeners, watch.  I got your nose.  Well, we can always revise them, and then we could give you... 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, because a visual joke...  You might not want to call it a visual joke on the radio.  Should we redo...  Yeah.  Would we redo the three?  Because his punchlines are still strong.  Maybe like...  They're great lines, of course.  They're standalone bits.  What about this?  Let's brainstorm right now in the air.  How about we just go, wow, this was a great line on the show yesterday.  Bam.  No, how about this?  Why does it have to be all fucking...  In conjunction with some old...  Who's telling you to produce all this shit?  What's going on?  Well, I like the visual jokes on the radio thing.  I just thought there should be better examples, because we do that a lot. 
[00:15:30]  But, hey, however, I did like the production around it.  How about in conjunction with some old porno magazine, this is a comic strip joke on the radio.  I guess.  Something like that.  Okay, so I'll revise these.  If that'll satisfy whatever the fuck they told you, sure.  Conjunction, revise...  These are words that these dummies don't use often.  No.  It's for you.  Why are you guys so scared?  I'm not scared.  I've never been less scared of my life.  You do realize you guys will both have very, very long careers, and there'll be a distant  memory eventually.  I got a million guys like those in my fucking career. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Stop being scared.  I'm not scared.  What do they tell you?  I've never been less scared of my life.  What do they tell you?  I'm all bits.  All the time.  What do they promise you?  No promises were made.  Never, never, never, never been promises.  A raise?  No.  Fuck.  A promotion?  No, no, no.  They don't ever promise anything like that.  In conjunction with some old porno magazine, this is a visual joke on the radio.  I remember a cartoon.  There were two hunters in the woods, and they were looking at a bear trap with just two 
[00:16:30]  bloody testicles hanging in it, and the capture was, somewhere out there is one mean  fucking bear.  In conjunction with some old porno magazine, that was a visual joke on the radio.  Once again, Jim killed it, took it, a little piece of audio.  I like the music and all, and the intro and the outro, but it doesn't, you know, these  guys are right.  Okay, well, we'll revise it.  They're not visual jokes.  We'll revise it?  Yeah.  Because you had to describe something, so I figure, because it wouldn't have been a 
[00:17:00]  joke if you had just said what it said.  You had to describe the bear and all that, so that's the visual part.  Look at this basket.  It looks like E-Rock's lunch.  See?  Visual joke on the radio.  Yes, mark that.  They didn't know there was a cow in the studio.  Looks like it's lunch.  We could certainly do visual jokes on the radio for you, now that we know it's a concept.  Could you?  Yes.  We can.  Luckily, I think we probably have like two or three more bits just out of this conversation.  Yeah.  Thank you, guys.  Every conversation gets bits.  Take it, someone says something like that to them. 
[00:17:30]  No, why does it always be like that, Jim?  I'm not saying in a bad way, I'm just saying somebody gave you some good darn toot and good  advice.  Oh, okay.  What was said in the meeting yesterday?  Anything of value?  Who was in the meeting?  The meeting was the staff, and then Gary and Rob.  Like this, but those guys can't get anything done.  No?  No.  They're fucking, they're bean counters.  Why are they telling you what to do?  They're just advising, I guess.  They're just, they want to make the show as best they can.  When are they going to start? 
[00:18:00]  You want another bit?  I like the Louis C.K. bit.  Yeah, play, sure.  I like it.  I like it a bit.  Which one's next?  Which one's this?  The boat bit.  This is a good one.  This is a little long, but it's good.  You'll appreciate it.  You'll like this.  A little long, but good.  Yeah.  Ahoy, mateys!  Time to launch back onto the seven seas with your favorite aqua adventurer, Captain Louie!  It was my first day in the boat.  I just bought it, but it's this big fucking boat with two engines, and it's really complicated 
[00:18:30]  to drive.  I took Chris Rock and my manager out on it.  We went out to the Statue of Liberty, and there was this thing floating in the water.  Chris saw it.  I said, what is that?  And it was this big thing, and it was dark.  It was night.  It was like one in the morning.  So it looked like, you know, like a big round raft?  That's what it looked like to me.  And I yelled over, hey, is anyone in that boat?  And then we noticed that it was coming towards us, like kind of with some speed, and Chris  goes, get the fuck away from that thing.  Like it was creepy.  So I backed away from it, and I put a light on it, and it was like, it looked like a giant 
[00:19:00]  manhole cover sticking out of the river.  This was the weirdest night fucking ever.  And it's right by the Statue of Liberty, and it's like, I don't know, 20 feet across,  and it's moving.  It's leaving a wake.  So I call up, and then this woman came on and says, New York Harbor Coast Guard, give  me your phone number.  So I give her my number, and this guy calls.  He goes, describe it as well as you can.  I go, I don't want to cause a problem, but it looks like the hatch of a submarine, and  it's headed towards Lower Manhattan.  That's what I'm seeing, and I'm sure it's not that, but my main concern is it's not lit, 
[00:19:30]  and it could cream anything that hits that's going down.  And the guy goes, all right, well, I'll call the boat and send them to you.  So he hangs up, and like 20 minutes later, there's nobody there.  So anyway, I call back, and they're not sending anybody, and at one point I got crazy, and  I was like, you are the Coast Guard, and I am saying to you now, there's a submarine  attacking Lower Manhattan.  I'm saying it.  And they're like, we're trying to get park police over here.  I'm like, send a fucking helicopter.  And he kept asking me to hover. 
[00:20:00]  We kept hovering around it and stuff, and then finally this big police boat comes and shines  like a massive light on it.  And then he calls me on the radio.  Hey, Captain, are you the one who reported this?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, it's a mooring ball.  It's been there since 1965.  Mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down.  You just hook up to it.  And I go, what if you don't see it?  And the guy goes, well, most people navigating those waters know what the fuck they're doing.  I have no business being on the water, and I would have hit it if I hadn't stopped at  the Statue of Liberty to show it off to Chris and them. 
[00:20:30]  Arrgh!  Ha ha!  Maybe not quite the adventure you were looking for.  Well, shiver me timbers and all that bullshit.  Ah, pigleg!  This fucking parrot just took a shit on me!  God damn it!  It's a good story.  It's a funny bit.  A lot of laughs in there.  Funny bit.  I don't believe you guys did these.  Did you do these?  I bet.  Of course.  Okay.  I thought maybe somebody else did the audio wraparound. 
[00:21:00]  Like Sal?  Manny?  Who would do it?  Or Rob?  Who did the voiceover?  Yeah, or wrote the bit.  Ah, the bit was written by...  Oh, no, those guys don't do anything creatively whatsoever.  Yeah, yeah, we wrote the bit.  They have no fucking...  And the voice was Mitch Todd, who's one of our voices.  Yeah, they don't have a creative bone in their bodies, those guys.  Who wrote the material?  Well, Louie did it from the show, but then...  No, no, no, the wraparound.  I did.  And who decided to put all the sound effects... 
[00:21:30]  I did.  What motivated you to go back and put splashing sounds...  What?  It's a boat.  ...while Louie's talking.  It's a boat, because he's sitting in the boat.  I understand that.  It made it more visual.  I didn't mind the sound effects.  It's not a bit if it's just a story.  It's a repurposed...  I think it was just spicing up the audio a little bit.  Not really, you know...  Spice?  ...taking anything away from it.  Yeah.  Just adding a little flavor.  You didn't do that?  You didn't think so?  No, just wondering why they don't do the songs. 
[00:22:00]  Do what songs?  You don't go back over a fucking GNR song.  Welcome to the jungle!  I'm going to put it in like...  Well, that would be because they have the music to decorate what they're saying.  That's the bit I want now.  I want you to repurpose Welcome to the Jungle for the radio show.  Okay.  You got it.  Yeah, we can do that.  So now we got four bits in a tin.  Repurpose the Welcome to the Jungle song.  We got fun and games.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Yeah, you know what you're doing.  You got it.  You know your way around a production studio. 
[00:22:30]  You got it.  Repurpose Welcome to the Jungle.  because Jimmy's trying to make a point that  I think comedians don't want their shit  like, uh, fucked with, right?  Yeah, I mean, that's not terrible, the little water sound,  the dinghy. I kind of like it.  It made it a little more visual.  But I understand your point.  You just can't really just play, like, I don't know, I don't think you just played...  That was kind of a best-of bit right there.  I didn't see much  of a bit to it. It was like,  because the wraparound thing  didn't really enhance  Louie's story at all. It introduced 
[00:23:00]  a new character, though. Really?  That's right. Arrgh, guy.  He's a pirate.  He sounded a lot like Spongebob and Squarepants.  That's where I got the inspiration from.  Yes. The guy who does the intro  for Spongebob. That's right. That's what I was thinking of.  I'm only with the Spongebob these days.  Arrgh. Are you ready,  kids? Are you ready?  Oh, how do you  know this? I watch Spongebob.  Why? I haven't.  There's some adult humor in the Spongebob.  Oh, yeah? Sure. 
[00:23:30]  Squidward.  I don't know what that is.  You don't know Spongebob Squarepants at all?  I know of Spongebob Squarepants.  If you enjoy a good cartoon,  that's one you should check out.  You don't need kids to watch that one.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's not that bad.  That one's not that bad.  It's Caillou that's a fucking  motherfucker.  I don't know Caillou.  Caillou stinks.  What's that?  You don't want to know.  I think he has cancer.  I'm not really sure.  What?  Is that the song of the being?  Caillou. 
[00:24:00]  Caillou.  Yeah, I've heard that.  I don't know.  I think it's a Canadian cartoon.  I'm not really sure.  What's it called?  The kid has no hair.  This thing.  And he's a whiny little fuck.  Oh, yeah.  It's a Charlie Brown knockoff.  Most parents, especially fathers,  don't want their kids watching the Caillou  because he's a bit whiny and wimpy.  Yeah, it's the Anthony Cumia cartoon.  Jesus Christ.  He just whines through the whole fucking thing.  Most parents do not like this fucking... 
[00:24:30]  But the kids, for some reason, like this.  Yeah, the song is bad.  It's not the opening song.  It's not the opening song.  Gosh.  You're getting to be a big boy.  Oh, sure.  This is terrific.  I'm just a kid who's four.  Each day I grow some more.  I like exploring.  I'm Caillou.  So many things to do. 
[00:25:00]  Each day is new.  I'll share them with you.  I'm Caillou.  My world is turning.  Changing each day.  With Mommy and Daddy, I'm finding my way.  Growing up is not so tough.  Except when I've had enough.  But there's lots of fun stuff.  I'm Caillou.  Oh, fuck.  It's like porno music.  Caillou.  I'm Caillou.  That's me.  And me. 
[00:25:30]  And me.  And me.  Yeah, me.  No, Uncle Paul, not you.  Oh, God.  And me.  Ah, shit.  There's your Caillou.  Yeah, I've had that fucking thing...  In your house?  Pop on when some of the kids are over here.  Yeah, they love it.  But man, the kid's just a wimpy fucking kid.  Yeah.  You want to play another bit?  Sure.  These are terrific.  If you like songs, can I recommend one? 
[00:26:00]  Sure.  Do you have the Black Keys bit?  No.  Still in front of you?  What happened to that?  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  That's a good one, though.  Because I had you singing to the Black Keys.  I don't really sing.  No, I know.  You repurposed me into singing?  Yeah.  It's not bad, though.  It's nothing bad.  Don't worry.  I saw it here a few days ago.  I don't know where it is.  I think Sal's getting it.  Sal's getting it.  In the meantime, we can play another one of the many bits that are in front of me.  What are the bits?  Elmo accuser number two is a bit?  No, I think those are just news things that Danny pulled. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, so we might be done with the bits for now.  Well, we got that Black Keys song that Sal's going to get.  We're kind of killing it right now.  Yeah, I think we're just on fire.  Oh, good.  Having C-Robin for Thanksgiving, you weirdo.  C-Robin.  Some stuffed C-Robin.  Yeah.  You're going to have C-Robin soup.  I'll have a wing.  Yeah.  What are you, a bird brain?  Ah, good one, Chipper.  I know.  Stop trying to tell me C-Robin is tasty.  Compliment.  Calm down. 
[00:27:00]  When are we going to try C-Robin?  Oof.  Don't want to.  Why?  Because I hear it's terrible.  That's what I've always heard by a bunch of people saying it's delicious.  Like fish jerky.  I must admit, I can't explain any of these thoughts racing through my brain.  It's true.  Babe, I'm howling for you.  Howling.  Howling. 
[00:27:30]  Howling.  Howling.  Babe, I'm howling for you.  What happened?  What was that?  You don't like that one?  It's all right.  Okay.  I didn't really like it.  You got some quantity going on.  Troy quantity.  I'll be honest.  I chose days ago not to play that one. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Yeah, Travis said you turned it over.  That's why Sal had to go and get it.  Yeah, this thing that happens is that we turn over shit that we don't want to play or do.  But then you brought it to everyone's attention.  So it was like, oh, fuck.  Now we're going to play it.  Good for you, Troy.  I'm sorry.  I was trying to save your feelings.  No, I don't.  Believe me.  Not everything I do, you're going to like.  So I'm completely aware of that.  I'm just trying to give you as much as I possibly can.  And then you decide what you like and want to present to the audience.  Thanksgiving's tomorrow. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  I can't wait to get out of here today.  Thanksgiving.  All right.  Well, thank you, guys.  I'm going to get back to work.  Why won't you tell me what happened yesterday?  Well, why did something have to happen yesterday?  Well, when did it happen this week?  I can guarantee you nothing happened yesterday.  Okay.  What day?  Oh, so that means something did happen.  Very good.  Thank you, Sam.  What happened?  Nothing.  It was good.  Let's say earlier in the week, Monday or Tuesday.  Nothing happened this week at all.  See, but you had a meeting last week or so. 
[00:29:00]  Obviously, something happened.  If we bring it up on the show, it probably will hurt you guys in the long run.  Well, I mean, that's never stopped you guys before.  Well, that's why we're prying.  If we're asking on the air, you have to answer it.  Well, I mean, we could always answer everything you say, which is fine.  Don't offer it up.  But, you know, you guys aren't really there then to defend us later on when we get a lambasting.  Were you told to work harder?  Well, I think it's always asked of the staff, anybody really in this building, to always work harder. 
[00:29:30]  But I think you guys work hard.  So why are they telling you to work harder?  I mean, I don't know why.  It always has to be them saying something.  I think we just want to end the year with a bang.  Who said end the year with a bang?  Nobody.  Did somebody say that in management?  No.  No?  No.  Sam?  Nobody said it to me.  See, they got to Sam.  No, they haven't gotten to me.  Show me the fucking scar in your skull where they got you.  Because they gave you the operation, obviously. 
[00:30:00]  Because this isn't the same Sam.  Cut out his brain, you bloody baboons.  Because nobody said anything to me.  And I don't want to tell somebody else's story.  Nobody's gotten to me, but it wasn't said to me.  They got to.  Who was it said to?  Have you heard it was said to somebody else?  I got him.  Know what we need to do, Ed.  You got to take one of these guys.  I take one of these guys.  And we got to go into separate rooms.  They'll break down.  Here's the scenario.  There's 48 interrogation.  Here's the scenario.  Some.  Last week. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  Troy came to me as the production designer of the show and said, Sam.  I love you.  I love you very much.  Exactly.  Physically.  Yeah.  Those dark marks made me feel differently.  Look at my turgid penis.  Yes.  He said that he wanted to start killing it and end the year with a bang.  And he needed my help to do so.  And so I decided to help my friend end the year with a bang.  And honestly, Sam is a very talented writer.  He's able to. 
[00:31:00]  At times.  Pull off.  That's a fucking Emmy speech.  Exactly.  I'd like to thank Sam.  But that's my part of it.  Nobody's gotten to me and there's no conversation that I had that I'm not telling you about.  I'm helping my friend.  But you may be aware of another conversation.  I could be aware of lots of things, but it's just not my place to tell.  But it is if you're asked.  It is fair.  On the air.  So who was told this thing?  From your eyes.  And there's a, you know, nobody else came to me and said, hey, Sam, let's kill it. 
[00:31:30]  But Troy came to you.  Sure.  And you're guessing, if you had to guess, would you guess that someone got to Troy?  I don't think somebody, some conversation probably.  Troy, you were told something?  Motivated, Troy.  What the fuck are you told?  I've been told a lot of things.  But you work hard, so what the fuck do they tell you?  Well, you know, it's just.  It's a certain time of year.  We're just like calling out the bullshit because we've heard a lot of the crap they tell you guys.  Certainly they've told us over the years.  And none of it is, none of it comes true.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I love, you know, I just want to end the year strong. 
[00:32:00]  It's obvious if it'll blow up his spot.  Forget it.  Well, I don't think it will.  It can blow up his spot if we are asking on the air.  And Troy and I, I think, also don't want anyone to think that our efforts in kind of ending the year with a bang are mocking.  You know what I mean?  No, of course not.  I don't want anybody to think they're illegitimate.  But again, what they think is irrelevant because we're asking you on the air, so.  Yeah, but you guys don't sign any checks, so it's not quite irrelevant. 
[00:32:30]  No, it is, but, you know, it's like you guys, you guys won't hang with us in the meeting then when we have to get blasted about stuff.  No, but we'll talk to them after the meeting if they blast you or the next day.  But I don't know if that even really does anything.  Sure it does because we talk about it on the air and they hate that.  Wait, so you get blasted?  I mean, there's been times that.  By who?  I mean, I think you know the answer to those questions.  Gary and Rob?  If it's blotter, that's one thing.  But Gary and Rob, they're just nonsense.  They're bean counters.  Those are our beans they're counting, though. 
[00:33:00]  Those are our bosses, though.  That's who we have to report to.  A, they can't do anything for your careers, and B, they're empty threats.  Well, I mean, I think that to some degree, but I also think that, you know, that they help move things forward if you play by their little bit of, you know.  No, they don't.  Because you just can't.  I mean, I guess you guys understand that you just can't just be like, fuck you to everybody and then think that anything good is going to happen. 
[00:33:30]  We made our careers off the air.  Yeah, but you guys are different.  We made our careers out of fuck you.  Why are we different?  Why?  Because you guys.  We're on your spot.  I'll tell you why.  Because you guys are talent.  And you guys are in a league that is just sort of untouchable.  But we were the fuck you guys when we weren't in this league.  But radio was also a different time.  Mr. Fuck you, man.  And it was also a different time in radio.  Yeah, radio was different.  But we're not even saying to say fuck you.  We don't want you to say fuck you.  No one's saying to say that. 
[00:34:00]  I think you guys got to kind of calm out on their bullshit because at this point, it's all bullshit.  Everything those two guys especially tell you never come true.  Never.  It might lead to a meeting with Bladder, but then Bladder still has to go to Greenstein.  Greenstein doesn't even know you guys are alive.  No, I know that.  That's the problem.  That's why we have to.  So when those two guys tell you anything, it means nothing.  Because Greenstein has no clue about it.  So you've got to get a little more anti-Semitic.  Yeah.  Around the hallways.  Yeah.  But you're not saying fuck you if we're just asking you questions. 
[00:34:30]  I understand not wanting to say fuck you to your bosses because you can't afford to do that.  But if we're asking you a legit question on the air, it's a fair...  There's a...  You know, and then we can finally move on.  There's a phoniness with the whole thing.  Like Gary and Rob, I'll just say it.  They can't do anything for you guys.  They tell you bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.  And then it's up to Bladder.  And then Bladder can't even do it.  He has to go to Greenstein.  Well, I mean...  These guys are bullshit, bullshit, bullshit in your face. 
[00:35:00]  You've got to understand that it means nothing.  I'm a little bit shocked that this is how our work is being responded to.  Yeah, especially because we're trying to give you, you know...  But that's the truth.  Well, I mean...  They think they've got some kind of power.  They don't have any.  You are allowed to say that.  I am not.  I understand.  So...  So I'm saying it on your behalf.  I'm just trying to be as good of a SiriusXM employee as I can and deliver to the Opie and Anthony show quality and quantity.  I mean, volume is definitely important.  So... 
[00:35:30]  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, the amount of material that we give you guys is definitely important.  And it's looked at at...  Who suggested to you recently that you weren't producing enough material?  Well, I mean, like I said, it's always something where we could always be giving more.  And even if you were...  Even if we had been producing around the clock, it's still...  Like oral.  Like they never...  They don't really ever hand out...  Always be giving more.  Compliments.  So someone said, let's end this year with a bang.  Someone said that term to you. 
[00:36:00]  Maybe last week.  Let's put out some more stuff.  Let's end this year with a bang.  So I'm just wondering, who used that expression?  No, nobody has used that expression.  That's a Troy expression.  You're in a tough spot right now, huh?  No, I'm cool, man.  Everything's good.  I just can't wait to get back in the lab and crank out some more shit.  Get more shit.  All right.  Fair enough.  We got nothing done.  No, we got a lot done.  You got a bunch of good bets.  You guys talk L.A. Kings and Knicks a lot?  Yeah, we love sports. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, we're big sports guys.  I don't remember ever hearing Sam really discussing the Knicks.  Carmelo Anthony.  Big fan with the brandy new Knicks hat.  Linsanity was crazy last year.  Do you watch basketball at all?  The last time I saw basketball was when I went to that game with you.  That was a year ago.  That was a year ago.  Yeah.  We were there for the beginning of Linsanity.  That's right.  On a fluke, by the way.  I didn't watch one game since.  Sat on a fish?  Sat on a fish.  Wow.  My brother had a couple tickets, said, you want to go? 
[00:37:00]  I haven't been to a Knicks game in a while.  And there we are for the birth of Linsanity.  After that, I did not watch another basketball game, no.  Big Knicks fan, though.  Big.  And Carmelo Anthony went to your school.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  So that alone, you should be a Knicks fan.  I am a Knicks fan.  That's why I'm wearing the hat.  They're 8-1.  They're having a very good year so far.  See, if you'd asked me, I would have said they're still undefeated.  Who knew?  So why the hat, then?  I didn't know.  Why the hat?  Oh, just because it looks cool.  It's an aesthetic. 
[00:37:30]  It's an urban thing you're going for right there.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Does that bother you?  Yeah.  It does.  Yeah, you're falling into the whole thing.  You didn't flat-brim it, which is cool.  And I took the stickers off.  Yeah.  That's not that bad, though, because it is a local team.  Just happen to be lucky you're in New York, because a lot of the local teams make it onto  the urban hats.  That's right.  I got a Brooklyn Nets hat, too.  It just happened to be Knicks.  And the Brooklyn thing.  Let me tell you something, also, about this Brooklyn Nets thing. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know much about basketball.  I don't think I'm going out on a limb saying that.  Uh-oh.  But this...  Oh, I can only imagine where this is going.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's not that bad.  Okay.  This embracing of Brooklyn by the Nets already, like, I think you've got to put in a good  at least year or two before they start on the sports going, and Brooklyn came out swinging  today with...  It's like...  Wait, what's going on?  I don't understand.  I don't think there's anything that different going on.  No, I mean... 
[00:38:30]  There's an excitement because the team moved.  But addressing them as, like, yeah, they're Brooklyn.  Like, they've been Brooklyn for fucking forever.  It's sort of...  You know, it could calm down on the Brooklyn thing with the Nets until a couple of years  goes by.  They've been in fucking Jersey, all right?  It's like...  It just seems like they're really pushing the Brooklyn thing to the point where it's like  saying, like, if I moved to Brooklyn tomorrow, I'd be like, I'm Brooklyn in the house.  Like, no, you're not Brooklyn.  Brooklyn is cool. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Brooklyn is the epicenter of cool.  They're trying to be ultra cool.  If you move to Brooklyn tomorrow, would you be able to walk around and profess that you  are Brooklyn?  Oh, yeah, I probably would.  Yeah, but you wouldn't.  You'd look so...  Yeah, but I wouldn't do that.  That's how the Nets thing is for me.  I know people do that, but that wouldn't be my thing.  But that's how the Nets is with me.  I'm looking, going like, you're not Brooklyn yet.  You will be.  It's a good start they got going.  The place is really nice, the venue and everything. 
[00:39:30]  But, no, it's way better than being in Jersey.  Well, yeah.  Some of those Jersey teams just kind of sit there.  I've had it with my Jersey sympathy over this hurricane, too.  Jersey's back to just sucking ass with me.  Why?  I just always hated Jersey.  You don't want Jersey?  Would never move there.  Them and the dumbass jug handles.  I hope every jug handle got flooded.  In Jersey?  I hate your jug handles.  Maybe.  I want to make...  Well, you see what happens when you don't have it.  You got to do it on the bridge.  You know how nice a jug handle would have been in The Godfather?  They fucking make a right and a left and wrap around. 
[00:40:00]  Lou invented the jug handle.  He's so tired of making that U-turn.  You know what?  It was Lou's call.  He drew it up.  He submitted it.  And they went, nice work, Lou.  Very funny.  I don't understand your Nets thing, to be honest with you.  I really don't.  You mean like sportscasters referring to them as Brooklyn?  They're embracing the Brooklyn thing.  Because it's really exciting with the new arena.  Well, of course, if I move to Brooklyn, which I did at one point, it was very exciting. 
[00:40:30]  I liked the area and stuff.  But to then profess that you're Brooklyn immediately, without putting a couple of years of actually being in Brooklyn in, just seems kind of fake.  And they're trying so hard.  Are they supposed to downplay the excitement?  Because it was a big move for the franchise.  No.  Do it in a different way than trying to make it seem like you've been there for fucking 20 years and you're Brooklyn in the house.  You know what happens when you do that?  What?  You create a false sense of loyalty and sell a ton of merchandise. 
[00:41:00]  I understand the logistics and finances behind it.  But it comes off as insincere to me and a bit phony to embrace Brooklyn when you're not really Brooklyn yet.  A lot of people buy the Brooklyn Nets stuff.  Oh, they love it.  And they're not fans of the team.  They love it.  More than probably most fucking NBA teams at this point.  Not only are they buying the Brooklyn Nets stuff, but when I went to the Jay-Z concert, before the season started,  the concert was full of people wearing Brooklyn Nets hats.  And some reality show was there giving free, real Brooklyn Nets tattoos. 
[00:41:30]  Like, not press-on tattoos.  So people were getting the logo on before the season started.  The first season hadn't started yet.  But then you're sitting there wearing a Knicks hat.  So you buy...  I used to call it buying the myth.  Buying the myth.  Like, you go to Disneyland or Disney World, and all of a sudden you buy a shitload of Mickey Mouse stuff,  and then you go home and go, what the fuck was I thinking?  But you're in the moment.  You're feeling it.  So you're like, oh, yeah.  You know, walking around this joint with a Mickey Mouse on your hat or something. 
[00:42:00]  You decide you're going to get married there, and then you look at your wedding photos,  and you're like, what the fuck are we thinking?  Oh.  We look like an asshole standing with a big mouse.  Sorry, Travis.  Oh, did Travis get married there?  Yes.  Yeah, the big Mickey.  Was it joyous?  The Mickey groom hat and the mini bride veil.  And that Funicello came out.  In her current state.  Yeah.  They wheeled her out.  Bothered everybody.  Oh, boy.  She came out looking like a gravy boat. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but I'm not feigning interest in the Knicks when I wear this hat.  I think you are.  No, I could care less about the Knicks.  Oh.  I don't care if they're losing.  But that's a black culture thing for the most part.  You know who used to do that?  Patrice.  He'd wear clothing with logos on it and be like, I have no idea.  I don't care.  Because the hat would match his shirt.  Matches my shirt or my sneakers.  But that's more black culture than white culture.  I have a Padres hat.  I don't know if they're still playing baseball.  All I'm saying is you've adopted the black culture thing.  That's more of a black culture thing.  I know white people do it, but not as much as black people. 
[00:43:00]  That part of the black culture makes a lot of sense.  It's a nice hat.  They wear team stuff out of fat.  Patrice went through that phase where he didn't care if it was the Seahawks.  He didn't give a shit.  Right.  Where they played.  Right.  From Marlins.  From Marlins.  You'd come in looking like a box of fucking Crayolas sometimes with that yellows and reds  and purples.  Different fucking colored jackets and hats and sneakers.  My favorite ever was the Pink Panther shirt.  And he came in in that fucking thing.  You can't wash it.  What?  That was the shirt you can't wash.  You can't wash. 
[00:43:30]  So how did he clean it?  He wore it once.  Right.  You can only wear it once.  Yeah, that's the other thing with the black culture.  Wearing things just once.  Right.  Sneakers one time.  One time.  I don't understand that.  One time.  Go feed your family.  It's a fake sense of success.  Why would you buy a pair of sneakers and fucking wear them once?  Phony success.  Your son's a big success.  Every time you go out, it's like you're going to the prom.  You got to look good.  Yeah.  But you can't wear your sneakers twice?  No.  I even asked that.  Patrice would do that stuff.  And I go, you can't wear them twice. 
[00:44:00]  No one will know that you...  Anyway, I go, no one will know that you didn't wear them, you know, that you wore them twice.  Yeah.  You can tell everyone I'm only wearing it the one time.  Yeah, but...  If you saw him on the street and he was wearing the same pair of sneakers that you saw him  and he was in studio like a week before...  Guess what?  No one even looks down.  The little laugh at you.  The little laugh at you.  He'll be like, oh shit.  The percentage of people that actually look down at shoes and sneakers are minimal.  White people don't look down.  I look down at sneakers. 
[00:44:30]  Somewhere in you, there is black.  Oh, there's so much black.  There has to be.  Yeah, but Patrice wouldn't wear the sneakers more than once.  He was one of those guys.  No.  I've had these sneakers for fucking a year and a half.  I'm really due for new sneaks.  Yeah, I buy one pair a year.  Why bother?  I don't do the sneaker thing too bad.  I got a few pairs of sneakers that I don't wear often, but other than that...  How many pairs of sneakers do you have yet?  You have more than a few. 
[00:45:00]  We did this bit already.  You got a lot.  You got at least ten in boxes.  Yeah, I probably have like between seven and ten.  And I don't really wear them.  So tell them why.  No, no, no.  Because they're new.  So wear them.  I'll wear them like at a special occasion.  Like I wore some nice sneakers when I went to that Jay-Z concert.  And then what happens to those sneakers?  Because we're going to get robbed.  I'm not going to get robbed at a Jay-Z concert.  Why do you need to look good for the Jay-Z concert?  You just need to look fresh, you know?  For who?  For me.  You don't look fresh.  I look a little fresh. 
[00:45:30]  You're a fucking gangly Mad Magazine character.  Well, that's what I'm trying to avoid.  So you were like, oh, I'm going to wear these nice new sneakers to the Jay-Z.  And no one gave a shit.  I didn't notice.  Did you give a shit?  I did, yes, I did.  Stepping in soda.  Thank you.  It's dark even at a concert.  So they're not looking down.  And you're all crowded together, so you can't even look down if you wanted to look down.  Yeah, but you feel better.  You don't.  No, you don't.  I never think about my shoes unless they hurt.  Obviously.  You know what I think about sneakers?  First day when I buy them, you put them on and go, wow, why didn't I get these?  Wow, they feel nice, right? 
[00:46:00]  That feels much better than my old piece of shit sneakers.  And then by the next day, you don't even notice.  That's why you only do the first day.  Oh.  You just made his point.  I know.  You just made his point.  Because within a week, you don't give a fuck about your new sneakers.  Nah, you can't do that every day.  If you're a real white guy.  Imagine having that feeling every day of your life.  That'd be amazing.  I would love that.  That'd be expensive.  Amazing.  That's why I need to make some money.  I like that nice, like you're strapped in, your foot is strapped in that sneaker. 
[00:46:30]  All tight.  Nice, tight, but cushy.  But in a good way.  Yeah, not hard tight, nice, cushy, tight.  It's supporting your ankle.  Everything's good before they all get raggedy and loose like an old vag.  I have a question.  Maybe that Sam is here alone.  Do you know anything about what we were talking about?  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Yeah, because I don't want that to be a waste of time, which obviously it was.  Yeah.  I know that didn't go anywhere, but there's some more bullshit going on. 
[00:47:00]  I'm sick of the bullshit.  Yeah.  They're either going to step up and do the right thing.  I'll tell you what's going on.  There's a lot of guys around here that need raises.  And big raises, not the stupid, tiny little thing they give these guys every once in a while.  And I do believe it's the same shit.  And I swear to you, no one talked to me.  I'm just, we've been in this game long enough to where our suspicions are raised.  I would bet that there was some more empty promises given to you guys like, well, you know,  if you do more work and show that you're valuable, maybe. 
[00:47:30]  In the dark, tin, tin, tin, tin, tin, tin, tin, tin.  Are they giving out any holiday bonuses this year?  Bonuses.  Ah, ah, bonuses.  Don't companies do that or there's no companies do that anymore?  Oh, they haven't done bonuses and Christmas parties in probably 10 years.  Any companies?  For the most part.  That went away about 10 years ago.  I haven't heard, like people used to talk about around the holidays, like, how'd you do?  What's your bonus?  Oh, yeah, it was good.  They gave me like a week, two weeks. 
[00:48:00]  They said, oh, what'd you get for your bonus?  And now no one even talks about bonuses.  It's a thing of the past.  And then the bonus went away, but then they snuck the really over-the-top Christmas party  at you.  So you're like, you're fucking kind of pissed off that you're not getting the bonus anymore,  but then you have this amazing night out where, you know, the food is terrific, the entertainment  is terrific, the drinks are terrific, you end up fucking half the fucking people you  work with.  Maybe I could shoot the manager, sort of like a bonus.  Yeah.  And then that snuck away, the big over-the-top Christmas party. 
[00:48:30]  But then they give you empty promises, like, you know, if you work hard, I might be able  to do a thing or two for you.  You want my opinion on what I think happened?  What do you think happened?  No one does.  Just take a guess.  There's two against you.  See, and I'll tell you what happens to really go inside.  Then we give these guys the reason why certain things don't happen by talking about it.  So that's where Sam is put in a tough spot and Troy, because now they'll go to them and 
[00:49:00]  go, look, you know, you know, you got to behave more.  We really don't want you talking about this on the air.  It makes it really tough for us to do the right thing.  So we actually give them the excuse, which is not cool.  But anybody who knows anything about radio knows that all that inside stuff is part of  the show.  It's like, management always gets talked about on the air.  Not every day, but I mean, if they do something or they say something, it's all fodder.  As long as you're not giving out their personal home numbers, you're allowed to talk about  it.  Right.  I honestly did not get a conversation, but I think that Troy, you know, at the end of 
[00:49:30]  the year, people get assessed for raises and stuff like that.  So I think probably a week or two ago, Troy was probably reminded of, you know, what general  time period it was and that assessments get made.  But has he decided that his strategy this year is to be like, look at all I did.  Oh.  But has it worked out in its favor in past years? 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  Because they probably get that speech every year.  I don't know.  I would say no.  When do you guys have your contracts?  Ours is October.  We don't actually have a contract, but the contract schmontract.  That's right.  Because we're just general employees, but that happens around February-ish.  And if a raise comes to a general employee, when would it be?  February-ish.  Okay.  February.  Usually.  What do they do?  Drag in.  Give you the old, so how do you feel you did this year? 
[00:50:30]  I would like that one.  See if they can get you to talk yourself out of your race.  What do you think you did?  All right.  Yeah, I sucked.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  How do you feel you did this year?  I did great.  Fucking great.  I hope.  Got to tell them.  I hope the new guys change some things around here.  It's just ridiculous.  New guys.  You never know what the new guys could be.  Even worse.  That's the strange part about that. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  It's just my opinion, by the way.  Troy didn't actually tell me.  No, but it's, you know, certainly would be in line with.  Par for the course, as they say.  Yeah.  Par for the course is probably what I was looking for there.  But, you know, we've seen it over the years.  Anyway.  All right.  So, sneakers.  Great.  Jay-Z sneakers.  So, what happened to those sneakers?  They're in my room.  They still look good.  So, I would still wear them again on a special occasion.  Your room at Mommy's house?  No. 
[00:51:30]  And how many pairs of sneakers do you have?  Are you a big boy house?  My apartment.  Your big boy house.  My one bedroom.  How many pairs of sneakers do you have?  Two.  One that doesn't fit very well.  So, I'd never wear them.  And the ones I have on.  I got two.  And one of them I'm going to throw away.  I'm throwing these away, like, pronto.  The second I'm not lazy enough to go to the store, I'm fucking getting rid of these.  I bought sneakers recently.  And for me, it's a disaster.  When me and Kenny went in Philly, I bought a pair of Nikes that fit really well.  So, I actually want to go buy another pair of the exact same sneakers. 
[00:52:00]  Like, just to have a second pair.  You have weird feet, right?  Dude, they're triple E width.  I have bad arches.  My fucking feet are awful.  You're not tall enough to have triple E width.  I know I have wide-boned feet.  And I have orthotics in them.  It's a horror show.  Orthotics.  I do, because I have really bad arches.  But the orthotics help.  But these sneakers, I put them on, and I just whistled a happy tune.  Yeah, felt good.  I was like, ah, I don't want to buy shoes.  And I put them on.  Right out.  What's wrong with your arches? 
[00:52:30]  I don't know.  They're a little off.  Are they flat?  I don't know.  Have they collapsed a little bit?  I feel bad for people that have feet problems.  You got like a wide foot with no fucking arches.  It's horrible.  It's like having a cardboard box flattened under your fucking ankle.  Were you walking on Jupiter when you were a child?  Sam has bad feet.  I can tell because he walks with his dumb feet pointed out.  Oh, his walk.  Which means you're compensating for something.  Well, he was discomfort.  You were supposed to get that bar.  You think so?  Yeah, your mom did you a disservice.  Oh, the one where they fasten your feet together with some metal pole? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, I think somebody...  Really?  I think someone in our family had that for a while.  You got to walk around like that.  Oh, I thought you meant the tube that goes in.  It causes an abortion that Sam was supposed to get.  What does that bar do?  Do they straighten out the feet a little bit?  Huh?  And allow it to grow properly?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think you were supposed to get the bar.  So you're not pigeon-toed or fucking...  What's the other one called?  Where was the bar?  In between the actual...  Knock-kneed sneakers?  Yeah, they fucking latched out of your feet.  Yeah, you were supposed to get the bar.  Silly.  Yeah, I'm okay with that.  I'm not physically uncomfortable.  You will be. 
[00:53:30]  When you get older, your hips are going to go.  Really?  Yep.  You'll get dysplasia.  You're going to have horrible hip problems.  I don't know what that is.  Just sounds bad.  Is that Ruben's...  Ruben's stuttered?  Stutter or whatever his fucking name is.  He's not dressed like Ruben's stuttered.  Wait, the guy walking away?  Wow, that guy has a massive upper half and his bottom half, he looks like he could be  a skinny guy.  The back of his head looks exactly like Marcellus Wallace.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whose is this?  Whose is this?  That's mine.  Oh, boy.  I'm taking it to my family's house. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, thank you.  I'm so happy.  Well, I got a tin of cookies.  Because there's delicious things in here that you don't want to eat, Jimmy.  No, I don't want them.  I'm actually happy that that belongs to someone.  Yes.  We got...  I almost just opened it.  Oh.  But I'm asking.  It's a Plugola gift.  Yeah.  Mr. or Mrs.?  It's Mrs.  It's Mrs.  Mr. Fields cookies?  Mrs.  Mrs. Fields.  What does Mr. Fields do?  Anything?  I don't know that.  Mrs. Fields, I guess.  Yeah.  Mr. Fields don't like fucked by anyone but Mrs. Fields. 
[00:54:30]  There's a big thing of cookies, which I'm trying to avoid, but I keep looking over at Anthony  and I see cookies in my field of vision.  I know.  And you're Mrs. Fields of vision.  Yeah.  But thank you.  Mrs. Fields cookies are very good.  But finally, I have a delicious treat in front of me now.  Egg whites.  Yuck.  So why do we got the cookies?  They're going to be advertising?  I don't know.  They just sent them.  Oh.  Plugola.  Nice.  I guess.  You know, I want to ramp up the Christmas gifts this year. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, like what?  That you're giving?  That would be nice.  No, that the listeners give us.  We only got like one gift each last year from somebody.  I really want a lot of gifts from the listeners this year.  Yeah, I'm saying it.  I got a great gift from one of the listeners.  As a matter of fact, he wanted me to let him know that I did receive it.  Uh-huh.  And I did.  And they were lovely, four lovely, classic Christmas ornaments.  Oh, boy.  What?  What are they from? 
[00:55:30]  I would say the mid to late 30s, perhaps?  Will you be hanging them?  I might hide them in the trees somewhere.  And they go, look, look, look at this.  And the little children go to get their presents on Christmas.  They'll be like, whoa, what's that?  It's colorful.  Yeah.  Yeah, there are three swastika ornaments.  And then one actually shaped in the shape of a Hitler's head and painted accordingly. 
[00:56:00]  Are they old or are they just new redone?  Uh, they fucking look old.  And they're, uh, I don't know.  And where do you make brand new Hitler and swastika ornaments?  They have goof places to make.  How do you get away with that?  What, the same place that makes rubber dog shit and whoopee cushions?  You can't even say nappy-headed hoe on the radio.  You think there's a company out there making these still?  Making some swastika ornaments.  That's cool.  And Hitler head ornaments.  I don't mean cool in that way. 
[00:56:30]  I mean that.  Well, it was, uh, he wanted me to let him know.  So, yes, I did receive them.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  You're itching to put those on your tree, aren't you?  Not really.  I'll be honest with you.  Not really.  I actually know that the, uh, maids and, uh, Ange were coming over the house today to  clean up and then finish up with, uh, some of the Christmas ornaments.  So I put them in a drawer, uh, so they wouldn't, weren't just laying out somewhere.  They think I'm weird enough over there.  Yeah, they don't need to see that hanging on your tree. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, yeah.  We don't have copies of this guy's book, do we?  Heads in beds.  We got that author in today.  We have a tell in today and Voss in today.  And, uh, this guy wrote this book.  There was a big article in the post about it.  Um, he, like, exposed a lot of the shit in the hotel industry.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to this.  I am too, but we don't have copies of the book or we do.  I mean, we don't need one.  I was still like to peruse it first.  But I'm just saying this is an easy one.  I'm a good peruser.  We have at least one in the back, I think.  Yeah.  Do I still have one copy?  I don't know.  We'll check.  I've only seen one copy. 
[00:57:30]  Why have they only seen one copy?  What kind of dumb book company sends one copy of a book?  A lot of book companies.  I think Roland's walking down the hall with the book.  And it looks like there's more than one copy.  Maybe, but when did they come?  It looks like there's at least three copies.  Maybe they came last week and I'm wrong.  That's why I'm asking.  I think they came yesterday.  I'm not sure.  Jimmy's a big fan of reading the books before these guys come in.  Yeah, when I, like, oh, the stones I couldn't get through.  I got enough of it.  We try to give you every book, uh, that we get as soon as we can.  Um, I gave it here before we can.  No, but when?  Last week?  Um, like, a day, two days ago. 
[00:58:00]  A day or two days ago?  Because we confirmed him later.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Uh, Rich is here.  I can't wait.  Say the thing with, uh, the Hamas and the Israel.  Hey, look, I want an expert opinion.  Uh, uh, what I think happens is that, uh, well, here's the thing.  He's scheduled for eight o'clock, and he marched down the hall at seven, and he's been just staring  at us outside the window.  Give him a bus ticket from Tel Aviv.  Wow.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:58:30]  We said that yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We just know it's coming when that happens.  We said it yesterday.  Yeah.  Wait, did it happen?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, it did.  Bus bombing in Tel Aviv already.  That's like their go-to play.  That's like their fucking, when Israel starts, uh, uh, getting over on them, that's what they  do.  I don't even know whose fault it is.  That whole region fucking stinks.  Exactly.  That whole shitty region. 
[00:59:00]  And it's not just the Palestinians and the Israelis.  It's the, the, all the infighting with all these other places.  That whole fucking region just eats my ass.  Their dumb religious laws.  Their complete lack of, um, any type of, uh, modern thinking.  We don't, we don't have a concept of what they're thinking.  Like I, I know as a family, man, I wouldn't, I would never like keep my family in a situation  like that.  There are a few things.  Like they, they insist on staying and I mean, it's unbelievable.  I would just say, you know what? 
[00:59:30]  Fuck it.  I, I, I, this, it's not worth it to me, but their religion is so strong that they just  think it very differently than religion, their hatred of, of each other based on nothing,  but their fucking gods and their dumb books.  Right.  So stupid.  Whole fucking area of the planet should fall into a hole.  Imagine no religion.  It's easy if you try.  Yes, it is.  Uh, no god or country.  Yeah.  She's in today. 
[01:00:00]  Only sky.  Yoko's in.  Yoko's in this afternoon.  Really?  I'm coming back to meet her.  Right.  No, don't do that.  She's got some brilliant songs too.  Wah!  Love that one.  I like that one and I also like, ooh!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Not for her.  Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss me love.  Really?  She's still, I gotta meet her though.  She's still.  Oh really?  I'm gonna be across the street at Fox.  I'm taping Red Eye this afternoon.  Nice.  So it's the same time she's here.  Oh, it's the early taping Red Eye.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's one of those.  Yes.  I'll, I'll be doing it next Friday.  Yeah, they didn't, they, they bumped you. 
[01:00:30]  They bumped me for Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  I emailed and said I can't make it.  No.  And they called Jimmy.  It's not true.  No, it's not true.  It's not true.  The pre-Thanksgiving show is notoriously big.  Oh.  Owl.  Owl.  All right, we got Rich Voss.  He'll join the program next.  David Tell's coming in.  And Jacob Tomsky, it looks like, right?  Mm-hmm.  Heads in beds.  His reckless memoir of hotels, hustles, and so-called hospitality. 
[01:01:00]  So-called.  Yeah, most hotels stink.  Let's be honest with each other.  And he's finally writing about it.  That's going to be a good interview.  All right?  Yike.  SiriusXM.  Follow the Opie and Anthony show online.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Opie Radio.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Croomia.  And Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Heading toward the big holiday. 
[01:01:30]  A lot of people driving.  Yeah, it's the big getaway day, they call it.  The big getaway day.  A lot of people traveling.  Yeah.  I guess-  Ant said it during the break.  This is like school.  Yeah.  The day before vacation. 
[01:02:00]  Vacation and school.  You're just so distracted.  You're just like, ah, look at the clock.  When's-  Wednesday, period.  Yep.  What's the matter, Sam?  You don't know what this concept is yet?  Vacations is what I don't know what the concept is.  Huh?  Okay.  Long weekend.  Any type of vacation, long weekend, time off.  Yes.  I hear you.  Rich Voss has entered the studio.  All right.  What's up, Rich?  It's Rich.  Rich Voss. 
[01:02:30]  How are you, buddy?  Miserable.  Why?  He's just always miserable.  Talk off the air.  Off the air.  You can't just say that.  No, things are good.  I'm just, things are, you know.  Why would you be miserable, though?  Do you have a job here?  Why are you miserable?  Things are good.  You're still wearing your wedding ring, so it's not that.  That's why he's miserable.  No, no.  Things are good with her.  Things are cool.  Good.  The other night, I go, let's have sex, and she just was so grossed out.  She goes, I'll blow you, because she didn't want to fuck me. 
[01:03:00]  It's like, I'll give you the consolation blowjob.  Yeah.  She grossed out, because it's me.  I don't know.  She just, you know, it's...  You know what it is?  It's so unsatisfying to her that she would rather just, you know, get it over with, you  cum, and not have to go through the whole thing of you pumping away on her.  Well, she got mad, like, the other night, I wanted to...  Sometimes, like, before, we used to have all these toys and stuff, and we don't have  them anymore, and...  What kind of toys? 
[01:03:30]  You know, like a couple of vibers, that little egg that you...  That you...  Shove in there?  No.  Look at his hands.  Yeah.  Jam in there?  When my daughter was first born...  Oh, boy.  I had the egg going.  This is true.  I had the egg going, and you vibrated on there, okay?  And we're both trying to look at porn, right?  And I'm all...  Like, I got the egg, I'm looking at porn, and the whole time, I'm shaking the bassinet  because the baby's crying.  Oh, are you serious?  Yeah, this is because she was sleeping in our room. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, but, like, last week, she got grossed out because I wanted to use...  We didn't have any toys, and I wanted to use, like, a dildo a little, just to fool around.  You know what I mean?  For your own ass.  So...  Yeah.  So...  So I...  I had these, like, Powerade drinks that come in the plastic tubes.  Oh, no.  You know what I'm talking about?  Like, they're...  I can imagine, yeah.  But they're shaped like that, so I went downstairs, and I had it under the sheet so she wouldn't 
[01:04:30]  see it, and I get ready to use it, and she looks and goes, what the fuck is wrong with  you?  But what's the difference?  Because there's, you know, Powerade juice, and it still serves its purpose.  Girls don't want just anything shoved up their pussy.  I found that out.  They're so...  That's like fraternity shit.  And the outside of that thing has been in, like, on a store shelf.  Oh, no.  I cleaned it off.  I cleaned it off.  Was it plastic, or is it hard plastic?  It's a hard plastic.  It works.  I've used it.  It's not fucking, you know, if it can get through me, it can get through that looseness. 
[01:05:00]  So she didn't want to do it.  She just grossed out.  What'd she say?  She goes, what's wrong with you?  What the fuck's wrong with you, right?  Yeah, but I don't know.  I'm not trying to be funny.  I'm just saying that, you know, so...  She tried to fuck her with a Powerade beverage.  Yeah.  And now she doesn't want to give you any puss?  That's funny.  I want to see what this thing looks like.  Yeah, it's just one...  It's a tube.  Right.  But is it rough on the end?  No, it's perfect.  There might be a...  I don't know if there's, like, a little jagged edge on it.  Because they absolutely make products, knowing that girls, you know, might just use it for 
[01:05:30]  something else.  We've done that bit, too.  Some of the things they...  That they use?  Yeah, just how they shape their products, you know.  Those electric toothbrushes, no one gave a fuck that you could get your teeth cleaner.  They had something else in mind that said, I think we could sell a lot of these things,  make them believe that you could get your teeth cleaner.  Especially because they have the little cap that you put over the brush.  You know what I mean?  So that's not going to hurt anybody?  Yeah.  Vibrating.  We were at a flea market once, just walking... 
[01:06:00]  And there was a used vibrator.  Like, you know, on the...  Like, oh, honey, you know that vibrator we were looking for?  Oh, God.  At a flea market?  At a flea market.  A used vibrator?  They had one on the table?  Yeah, you know how people put their shit out there?  And it was the old white one, you know, that you get a screw in the big batteries.  Oh, I forgot about that shit.  The old white...  Well, it's not a vibrator.  It's a muscle relaxer.  Yeah, yeah.  A massage tool.  I would love to be in some of these meetings. 
[01:06:30]  Because, you know, I'll go back to the toothbrush.  They're like, girls will fucking use this, you know?  They love the shower heads that go down.  Right.  All that stuff.  Don't, you know...  Fucking brush handles.  Yeah, they do it.  Sometimes we'll put...  He does anything.  We'll do a brush thing, me and my wife.  Like, she'll put a brush in my ass, and then I'll comb her hair like that for foreplay.  Why are you doing bits?  Why are you doing bits?  Because I'll tell you what, it started becoming a bit when he said, I'll comb her hair.  All right.  It was the truth when he said, she'll put the brush handle in my ass, and he made it into 
[01:07:00]  a funny bit.  Yeah.  Why am I doing...  Because that's like...  That line kills.  Where did it kill?  Everywhere on stage.  Yeah, I know.  Why did you feel like you had to do that right now?  Everywhere.  You're doing fine.  I just feel like, you know, I got a little Regan in me, so I figured I'd throw that out.  It's a great line, but what are you doing?  I know.  I'm sorry.  We're having a good conversation.  I've never done a bit in my life on this show.  There's some comedy here.  He had to go with the guarantee.  I want to see what he...  The Gatorade thing.  What is it called?  It's like some kind of Powerade.  Powerade.  It's like a protein drink. 
[01:07:30]  In little tubes, I've never seen these things.  A protein drink.  Just like a protein drinks.  You don't even know.  Well, I don't remember the name of it.  You take it after you work out.  And they're in little tubes.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  It was on...  Okay.  It was on that show.  Protein.  Yeah, like that.  Yeah, that's exactly the tube.  Okay.  Right there.  Yeah.  All right.  That's very dildo-ish.  She shouldn't be that mad.  Yeah, that's good.  The mistake you made, you should have painted it black.  That's right.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Put poor skin on it. 
[01:08:00]  Slack.  And it was nice and cold, you know?  So she won't work anymore?  Yeah.  She's like, don't you like cold?  Don't you?  Have you ever got blown with a girl that put ice cubes in her mouth?  No.  A guy?  A warm, wet mouth.  Yeah, we learned that years ago.  I had a girl blow me with pop rocks in her mouth.  It does nothing for me.  That's shit.  I don't need a blowjob spiced up.  I need a wet, sloppy mouth.  You're supposed to drink warm tea.  And then have ice water.  Remember Laura Korn?  Who can forget? 
[01:08:30]  What happened to her?  Her hijinks.  She's on someone's foot.  Who gave you guys a present?  I don't know.  Mrs. Fields.  Mr. Fields or something.  Mrs. Fields.  That really came from the company?  No, it's a forgery.  No, we decided to fucking go to Mrs. Fields before the show and get a basket of cookies.  Of course it came from the company.  But why?  Because we're fucking really important people.  I love us.  We could sell a lot of products, so this is plug-ola shit. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  See, we're talking about Mrs. Fields cookies now.  See how smart they are?  That's pretty smart.  Yeah.  You want that, right?  You want to wrap that up for somebody this Christmas.  That's going to my...  That's the family's house there for Thanksgiving.  That's a good idea.  That's what I'm going to bring over.  Hi.  It's a huge basket of cookies.  I'm going to add a bottle of wine.  It looks terrific.  I'm set.  I can't have any cookies.  Why?  I'm trying to eat better.  How's that working out for you?  It looks great.  Not bad.  No, he does.  Not bad.  He's exercising, losing weight. 
[01:09:30]  He's losing weight.  But what does he do with his face?  Oh, that's just hurtful.  Is it 1960?  Hurtful and mean.  Why would you do that?  Because you guys...  It's the day before Thanksgiving.  We're all in a very good mood.  We're all thankful about our holidays and friendship.  We're getting along with each other.  We're being nice.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do for Thanksgiving?  Go to my sister's house.  The rich house.  The fucking...  Is that what you do?  Mansion.  Mansion.  Where is that?  Jersey?  Fucking yeah.  That she didn't earn?  She didn't earn. 
[01:10:00]  And that bothers you?  What?  Did she earn it or...?  Oh, she earned it.  That bitch is a hard worker.  What did she do?  Drug companies.  She sells drugs.  Fuck.  Nice.  I mean, she used to work with Warner Lambert.  Then Pfizer took him over.  She had major stocks.  She's always like a fucking big gig in these drug companies.  So she got a nice house?  Fuck, it makes your house look ghetto.  How much is she worth?  You don't have to fucking be mean.  But it doesn't make your house look ghetto.  No, it is.  It's fucking...  What makes her house so much better than ants?  It's on top of a hill looking where you can see New York. 
[01:10:30]  The view of New York from the hill.  It's got...  It's just beautiful.  The outside is like nice rocks, not like Italian stucco like everybody else in his family has.  It's not...  There's no horrible statues in it.  Why don't you give Sam...  Write the address off here.  We can look at it on Google Maps or Google Earth.  Yeah, that'd be good.  I don't know if I know the address. 
[01:11:00]  How would I know?  It's not in your phone?  I don't know if I know the address.  And he goes, how would I know that?  Because it's your sister?  I don't know if I know the address.  Do you know your sister's address?  Yes, I do.  Or your brother's address?  Yes, I do.  I don't.  I have it written down.  I'd be able to find it on Google Maps.  Or at the very least, I could...  Yeah.  Maybe not the exact number, but I would be on the pit of point.  You zoom in.  You're like, all right, it's a right turn there.  Yeah, right down one of the streets, it's right on.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  And then Sam can go look it up.  We can take a look at this house.  Yeah.  See what the hell the hubbub is. 
[01:11:30]  How much is she worth?  Yeah, how much?  How much?  How much is she worth?  How much?  More than two million?  What city?  Does she have kids?  No.  Husband?  No, she's married.  Her husband's like one of the best carpenters on the planet.  Jesus?  Yes.  How much do they worth?  It's 33.  I don't know.  She's got a yacht, string of paloponies.  She has everything.  Of what?  You.  He got it.  She has paloponies, of course.  She has a yacht, nice cars. 
[01:12:00]  Best callback ever, by the way.  Oh, yes.  What is a string of paloponies?  What is a string of paloponies?  Rachel, you've come back.  Oh, is that, we're close?  That's the road, right?  I don't know.  All right, Rich.  No, no, you wrote it down.  Rich, it's a map.  You just got to know which way you have to turn once you get.  Yeah, do you know how to get there?  This is an aerial view.  He's looking at it.  He's like, oh, I thought we were looking at broccoli. 
[01:12:30]  That's trees.  Yeah.  That's Bruce's cousin.  Yes.  Do you know where it is?  Do you recognize that baseball field?  No, it's up top.  I'll text her.  Hold on.  It's up top.  What does that mean?  It's on top of the mountain.  I think he meant north.  It's on top of the mountain.  Old Smokey?  All right, I'll text her and ask for her.  Right.  Is she up right now?  Selling her drugs?  I don't fucking know.  I don't really talk with her. 
[01:13:00]  Why?  He's jealous.  No, because she's tired.  She's embarrassed by him.  How's your brother doing?  Oh, I got to call him.  It's really short.  You're on the radio.  I called him.  Hey, turtle hands, fucking get to it.  Use those reptilian things on your fucking wrists.  How is your brother doing?  I guess he's doing okay.  The last time I talked to him, the hurricane didn't affect him.  No. 
[01:13:30]  So, you know.  Well, the diabetes didn't.  Oh, God, that's right.  Ow.  Sorry, Rich.  How's he doing, though?  He's all right?  Yeah, yeah.  Rich has Asperger's.  You think so?  Partial autism, yeah.  Why?  Because emotionally, he's just.  Dead inside.  But he's a good guy.  I love Voss, but he's just a fucking. . .  He's autistic.  Maybe because he's seen a lot of hard things growing up.  Nah.  Just made him dead.  Even Bonnie knows.  Heart chips.  Heart chips. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, I mean, my life hasn't been easy, but I've. . . .  Why don't you like your sister?  I'm not saying it's been easy.  I don't dislike her.  She's just too. . .  She's so left-wing.  It's beyond control.  Oh, politics will break up families.  It's just too, you know. . .  I don't talk politics with family members.  Self-hating Jew?  Fuck that.  Lefty?  Yeah.  You know, they. . .  It's just. . .  Why would you eat in the middle of a discussion?  Because he's that damn good at this.  He knows it.  Rich.  Tell him, Rich.  I back up.  I know what you're doing when I do it.  You don't know what you're doing. 
[01:14:30]  You're in the middle of a conversation.  I'm bad with it, but literally he's in mid-discussion.  What time?  Hold on.  Okay.  He picked the worst time to take a bite.  To take a bite.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Usually we go, I think I could sneak a bite in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then I watch while you get caught, and you're like, oh, fuck.  You don't have to time the bites, or even the size of the bite.  Right.  Like, he took a giant bite right when he knew he had to talk.  Yeah, and then he'll chew gum, and then, like, knowing he has to. . .  Like, if you're the center of attention at the moment, like, if you know you have to talk,  you don't just. . .  Then you've got to watch that sandwich and not take a bite.  That's a good point, but, you know, people are listening. 
[01:15:00]  So, who cares if. . .  Wait, who cares if she's left-leaning?  That means you guys discuss it.  Because I'm sure I've got family members that don't think the same way politically,  but I don't discuss it with them.  They're so close-minded.  It doesn't matter what you say.  They'll come up with. . .  They're close.  My father's like that.  He's so, you know, liberal.  And it's not even being to one side.  They're too much to one side.  Yeah.  You know. . .  They have to bring it up a lot.  There's no reason with them, you know. 
[01:15:30]  No reasoning?  Yeah.  Yeah, whatever.  You know, it's still early.  I'm going to kick in.  So, why go to your sister's house at all?  Well, where are we going?  My kids will be there.  Where, you know, where else are we going to go?  Me and Bonnie?  I'm not going to have to. . .  So, what happens?  You just sit on a couch by yourself and watch the clock?  No, we go there, and I fucking. . .  What?  You're just always entertaining.  What did I say. . . 
[01:16:00]  What did I say?  You said. . .  That's the beauty.  Where else do we going to go?  It's like, can you replay that?  It's just. . .  It's just these little moments that shouldn't even be acknowledged.  Your mouth is just a gold mine.  Oh, God.  It's amazing.  Every time. . .  I thought it was yours for a next school show.  And then here he is.  Brilliantly fun.  Rich is brilliantly quick.  That's funny. 
[01:16:30]  You are quick.  He is the opposite.  He is as dumb as you can be and is absolutely comedically brilliant and fast as you can be.  Within seconds of each other.  Nothing in the middle.  Which is so strange.  It should be. . .  You should have your own show, like, about one person who does, like, a cop buddy movie  which is used to use called Dunderhead and Rich.  Does your. . .  Does your sister look like you?  Ugly.  She's ugly?  You're saying on the radio that your sister's ugly?  Spitting image. 
[01:17:00]  Yes, she does.  So she's your twin.  Oh, he's got it.  Let's hear it.  Oh, here.  Hold on.  No, Rich.  Hold on.  You put your headphones on.  You're playing audio.  Okay, Travis.  So why go to your sister's house at all?  Well, where are we going?  My kids will be there.  You know, where else are we going to go?  Me and Bonnie?  Where else are we going to go?  Where else are we going to go?  Oh, that was her landline.  Texted her landline.  That wasn't Dunderhead.  That wasn't Rich.  That was Dunderhead.  Yeah, Dunderhead and Rich. 
[01:17:30]  New this fall.  Yeah.  It's like Cagney and Lacey.  Who's the other one?  Something in Isles.  That awful.  You know the one I always see on Broadway?  Rizzoli and Isles.  Rizzoli and Isles.  It's the worst name.  It might even be a good show.  Have you seen it?  It's terrible sounding, that name.  How is it?  It doesn't sound good.  Jake and the Fat Man.  That was one.  Yeah.  I think Cannon was in that.  Oh, yeah.  Bobby has a sitcom?  I was just going to, see, this is why he's quick.  I was just going to show you a picture of Jake and the Fat Man from the other day. 
[01:18:00]  There he is.  Jake and the Fat Man.  Oh, look at it.  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  You were going over Bobby's for Thanksgiving there, Jim?  Oh.  Yes.  Let me see Bobby.  What is he doing?  What the hell?  That's Bobby?  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  What is he doing?  I don't know.  That's...  How long ago is that?  Two nights ago at Del Frisco's. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, man.  I can't believe that's the same guy I met, what, maybe eight years ago?  Nine years ago?  That young Hispanic, thin Hispanic man.  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  You know, speaking of fat slobs, Iraq comes to mind.  And...  But he's not even here.  I know.  But do you know where Iraq was?  I was looking through some photos that somebody was posting on Twitter last night. 
[01:19:00]  ONA photos or something.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  But it was like, he had pictures from all NEW shit.  Yeah, it's a Twitter account called OA photos.  Yeah, OA photos.  Just posting all the old shit.  Yeah.  And there were some Mulcahy's photos from 2000.  Oh, wow.  And in the crowd, right up front, a very young Iraq.  No!  Standing there.  Can we find those?  Just looking up.  Really?  Looking up.  Obviously.  Is that the Mulcahy's one?  Yeah, obviously.  Before.  All right, start the first.  No.  Keep going.  It's 2000.  No. 
[01:19:30]  Remember this?  No.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Get to the Iraq one, though, first.  No.  Wow.  Just keep going.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  We used to be fucking famous.  No.  No.  Look how famous we used to be.  No.  Oh, my God.  No.  Spaz.  No.  No.  Spaz.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  That's young Nagel.  What the fuck?  Zoom in.  Zoom in.  Look at this psychotic look on his face.  He's an audience member?  Yes.  He's studying us.  Look at him.  Look at his face.  Spaz is just having a good time, and E-Rock is studying us. 
[01:20:00]  Wow.  That's a guy that's going to shoot somebody.  Yes.  He's just studying us.  Dude, I was going through those last night, and I'm like, is that fucking E-Rock?  Wow.  Young Mr. Nagel.  Before he worked for us.  I got blown that night on the bus.  I got blown on the bus by a girl, and she spit my cum in the top of the fucking keg and  wrecked it for everybody.  Wrecked the keg.  Was that the same show?  I don't think so.  Oh, no?  No, because we used to go to Mulcahy's a lot.  Oh, maybe I might have enough of it.  Okay.  Maybe it was. 
[01:20:30]  I don't know.  I only remember that being once.  Sam, go back to us for a second.  Wow.  Young E-Rock.  Everyone else is just partying and having a good time, and he's just, like, staring.  He's looking like.  That was Spaz.  I didn't really know Spaz.  And he's in deep thought.  He was, right?  There's the next picture I think he's in, also.  The very next one.  I kind of like the OA photos, Twitter account.  There's Young E-Rock.  He's finally updating that again, so do yourself a favor.  Look at him just cultivating that additional chin that'll be coming in shortly. 
[01:21:00]  There it is.  He's just cultivating it there.  It's just beginning right there.  Yeah, yeah.  The beginning stage.  Yep.  That's pretty good.  What is he seeing that's different than everyone else?  Because everyone else is just pointing.  Obviously, there's tits or something on stage.  Must have been a roast on the stage.  Yeah, he was there, man.  Oh, Doc.  Loving it.  What?  I just rubbed my penis on Rich's ass, but he didn't move.  Oh, he loved it.  Yeah, I had to back off. 
[01:21:30]  Your sister lives in the middle of the trees, it looks like.  Something.  Does this road look familiar?  Yeah.  Hold on.  There's no house.  Is it in here?  I don't know.  No, that's not it.  It's this way.  This way.  It's this way.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Watch out.  Don't hit that car.  Major monster houses.  It's not in this little gated thing? 
[01:22:00]  No.  No, she has a cobblestone driver.  For a brother.  Oh.  For a brother.  You said she has a cobblestone.  Anthony said for a brother.  That's a great description of someone being dumb.  He's a real cobblestone.  Can you see it now?  This is it.  What do you mean?  She lives in the road.  That's the address that you just gave me. 
[01:22:30]  There's no house there?  Well, go that way or that way?  There's no house.  Where do you want me to go?  Drive down the virtual road.  You can't drive down the virtual road because that's where the address is.  Drive down the virtual road.  Right.  All right.  Now look around.  Is that it?  Is that it?  Oh.  That looks like a cobblestone, though.  Yeah.  Oh, that might be it.  Yeah, it's down there.  Oh, my God.  How do we know before you do?  I've never been there.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Keep going back.  This way.  Is that it?  I can't see the house. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, that might be it.  That's the house?  I mean, I can't go into the driveway.  What?  Why not?  We'll move up a little bit and we can get a better.  It's roads.  No, I know.  Go up the road slightly to the left and you'll get a better view of the house through the trees.  I thought you could just, wow, I thought you could turn the whole picture like that.  That's amazing.  I love Jimmy.  Does he do this on purpose?  I love Jimmy.  Oh, can't see the house from there.  Did he go too far?  Oh, I don't mean.  Oh, yeah.  It's in the woods.  Wow.  Looks nice, though.  That area.  A lot of property.  Pretty good.  Yeah.  Well, you know what? 
[01:23:30]  For a person that voted for Obama, there's not too many Obamas in the neighborhood.  Well, I'm sure they'll tax the shit out of her.  But that is interesting to me.  People who have so much money that don't mind the high.  The 50% death tax annoys me more than almost anything I've ever heard.  You can't even leave your money for your family.  How fucking dare the government, man?  That's disgusting.  Wow.  Insane.  You have to start giving it away before you die.  Less than $10,000 at a time.  If I wanted to live in Jersey, I could have a fucking pretty good place.  What's that?  If I wanted to live in fucking Jersey, in the woods of Jersey. 
[01:24:00]  Well, that's not the woods.  That's overlooking New York.  I am.  It's up in the mountains.  But it's still cheaper.  How far away from the city?  Huh?  How far away from the city?  That's probably 35 minutes, 40.  Perfect.  Yeah, that's...  That, believe you me, is the prime...  A three-car garage where you can build an apartment above it.  Ceilings that are so fucking high.  How much did I go for?  That house and the property.  I would have to say it's probably worth two mil. 
[01:24:30]  Jesus.  Ugh.  Does that make you sick?  Totally.  Yeah.  It's...  You know, you just got stupid money.  No, because I got to live in Nassau County.  Because I got to live in Nassau County.  Right.  All right.  Well, your house is great, though.  I mean...  I know, but you know what?  For what I paid for it, I could go to a place in Jersey or fucking...  Have a castle.  Imagine if I moved to Pennsylvania.  I could own half the state.  My state!  Yeah.  They would call it your state?  My state.  Anthonyvania.  And you could hunt year-round? 
[01:25:00]  Yes.  In Pennsylvania?  Maybe the most elusive and clever of prey.  And Pennsylvania...  Pennsylvania is the number one capital in the country for white supremacy?  Is it?  Yeah.  How do you know that?  I just know.  How do you know anything?  Someone taught you.  Or you read it somewhere.  But they're number one in the country.  You know, with New York and different areas.  It's...  How do you know that?  Per capital is number one. 
[01:25:30]  I don't believe that.  Well, look it up.  What did you just say?  I said Pennsylvania is the number one state in the country for white supremacy per square mile.  No, you didn't say square mile.  Well, it doesn't matter.  What did you say?  Per what?  Per what?  Per what?  Per capital.  Per capital.  Per capital.  Well, how else do you fucking say it?  Per capital.  Don't give him a per capita.  You can learn something today.  Per capita. 
[01:26:00]  Per capita.  Per capita.  There's one capital per state, so it's always per one.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  What are you promoting?  It was a great appearance.  Thanks for coming by today.  Oh, thanks.  I'm at Gotham this weekend.  Yes.  Okay.  Starting what?  Friday, Saturday, Gotham.  Very cool.  GothamComedyClub.com to see Rich Voss.  Where are you New Year's Eve?  He'll be at the comedy shop in New Jersey.  Where's that?  Are you in Jersey?  No, New Year's Eve.  I'm in that place in the Poconos.  I just got it.  You're not in Buffalo? 
[01:26:30]  No, I'm there the week after.  You're there.  I'm there like the second and third or whatever right after you.  I'm there New Year's week.  I'm curious to how that club's going to do the helium up there.  It's not open yet, I don't think.  It's not open.  Are you opening it?  I hope not.  I mean, because I want it.  The bugs worked out first, but they said that they're working on getting it open fast.  It's harder to go into a club when it's brand new because there's no history of people going there.  People are weird creatures of habit.  They build up mailing lists.  Yeah.  They go back.  They see a few shows.  It's always easier to go once the club's been there. 
[01:27:00]  I'm there for that like three days after you, which I get the worst week of the year.  The worst week.  We'll be back with David Tell and more with Rich Voss.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Got David Tell coming in too today.  Rich Voss in studio.  His wife's not having sex with him anymore. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, we are.  People.  Oh, it was just that one time?  Yeah.  No, people on Twitter, there's an ad that go, you don't have sex.  We have sex.  We're a married couple, you know, with a kid.  It's, you know, we have it.  If a kid comes and sleeps in our bed in the middle of the night, you know.  In the middle of the night, you're not having sex.  Sex.  Slam.  Don't you get it done before then?  Yeah, we get it.  We probably like watch one homeland, take a break real quick, do it, then watch another homeland. 
[01:28:00]  Really?  Yeah, we do it in between snacks and shows.  Oh, man.  Really?  That's awesome.  And we get, you know, we get real quick.  In the middle of the homeland marathon, you get a couple in, right?  Real quick, and we just knock it out.  Knock it out, get it done.  It's kind of the point where it's like a bathroom visit.  Just kind of doing a life function.  Yeah.  No real.  It's like brushing your teeth, you know, you just got to do it.  It's like, it's like a chore.  Yeah.  A chore.  Does she still get turned on by your hairy abs? 
[01:28:30]  She gets turned on.  I don't know.  She goes, just pretend you're someone else every time.  Ah.  Closes her eyes.  So, you know, it's good.  It is what it is.  You know, I'm older.  After a while, I think you start to lose interest a little.  That's what everybody says when you're married.  You know, or even when you get older, I mean, you're just, you know, what the heck?  I've done it all.  Language.  I've been with supermodels.  I've been with, you know, major players, you know, after a while, you know.  Really?  It's just crazy. 
[01:29:00]  She thinks I'm gay because I say gay things, you know.  What are gay things?  Yeah, what are some of the gay things you say?  I remember getting fucked in the ass.  Jimmy.  What do you mean you say gay things?  I don't know jokes when we're doing our podcast.  My wife hates me on iTunes or Ryacast.  And, you know, whatever.  She just takes everything, you know.  Okay, well, what's one of the things you'll say that she'll take long?  Like if I'm watching a porno and some girl's blowing a guy, I go, how lucky she is. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  I'll go look at her.  Well, the reason your wife probably calls that gay is because she overhears you saying that out loud alone.  I had higher hopes for that.  Yeah, yeah.  I hear you.  It was too wordy.  Fair enough.  It's like.  Yeah, it's true.  You're doing a documentary on a joke.  See, you should have just left it at wordy.  I should have.  You know what?  There's not a lot of energy in here.  And I've always noticed that right before a holiday and a break.  We said that.  We usually have crazy shows before these.  Yeah, I don't know what happened.  I'm just angry at my fucking manager right now.  If I.  Oh, boy. 
[01:30:00]  I'm just.  What happened?  I'm just.  I'll tell you off air.  It's nothing major, but it could just be.  If it's one of these scatterbrained things.  I'm just so.  But I'm hoping I'm wrong.  But I have a feeling he was supposed to do something that he didn't do.  Oh.  And if it hasn't been done, I am so fucking livid.  It's like.  What's a manager?  A guy who you expect to do things who forgets.  Your guy is so good, like, as talking to. 
[01:30:30]  Like, I don't know about business, but he's the best guy to hang out and talk with.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  And he's a smart guy.  And he's a.  He's great at communicating with people and people like him.  But he's scatterbrained sometimes.  And it makes me like so angry.  I want to bite myself.  Because you're really, you know, persistent or whatever.  What's the word?  Not persistent.  Kind of like obsessive. 
[01:31:00]  You, you know, you're.  But when I say let's call someone.  Responsible.  You're responsible.  When I say let's call somebody.  And I hear.  No, no, no.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.  No, okay.  I will.  And it's like that person hasn't been called or whatever.  Like, that makes me fucking nuts.  Does that get.  Would that get you madder than Kenny not bringing your pillow on the road?  Your special pillow that you bring?  I don't bring a special pillow.  That's what I heard.  That you bring a pillow.  You heard it incorrectly.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you mean my neck pillow?  No, not your neck pillow.  That's what I bring.  I fly with it. 
[01:31:30]  Not your neck pillow that falls right through your head because you don't have a chain.  I understand.  I understand.  Every time you wake up, it's on your forehead on the plane.  Oh, wow.  When's the last time you flew coach?  Like, do you always fly first class?  Yeah.  By getting bumped up or in the contract?  I know, not with Leno, I mean club gigs.  When I'm paying for it, I'll either upgrade with miles, I'll fly on miles, or I'll pay for it. 
[01:32:00]  But I pay for very few flights overall, so it's worth it to me.  It's a write-off.  But, like, it's almost impossible to get bumped up now.  Yes, I United, that merger, that fucking airline sucks my dick.  Oh, I got it too.  Continental was pretty good.  Yeah.  United is fucking...  What's wrong?  They're just terrible.  I've flown United a bunch of times.  My miles are expiring.  Continental miles never did.  They're just...  What do you mean expiring? 
[01:32:30]  They're just...  If you don't use them, they're expiring?  What do you mean?  In mid-use, they actually kick you off the plane.  They'll only fly you halfway to LA.  They boot you out over Minneapolis.  But how do they expire your miles?  Exactly.  I don't know.  They're absolutely terrible.  Let me tell you about those scumbags, United.  I had a pair.  But who else could you fly?  We're running out of options.  American or Delta, I've been flying...  We're running out of options.  Do you know how bad you have to fuck up to lose me as that airline? 
[01:33:00]  How loyal I was for years.  Loyal, you got us all involved.  I got him involved in Continental.  I didn't give a fuck about flying until Jimmy started telling us,  now we all do what you do.  They don't care.  When I flew, I had those sunglasses you told me,  the Maui Jacks that were like 300.  You got them?  Not anymore.  They were stolen out of my golf bag,  along with another thing, a harness.  I think you told the story already.  No, I didn't tell the story.  I think Bonnie told us.  No.  But here's the thing.  Maybe I did.  I don't know.  All I know is I'm not getting the money back, 
[01:33:30]  but they caught the TSA agents in Newark  that were stealing the stuff.  TMB?  What's that?  TSA?  Yeah, TSA.  Yeah.  They caught them.  They caught them.  Sneaky.  But yet, my stuff was stolen.  Sneaky.  But it's United, hold on.  If it's a TSA agent and not a United employee,  wouldn't that be the TSA agent?  No, I handed my bags to United.  I didn't hand them to TSA.  Point being, you wanted your glasses back.  Say, hey, you know who stole them, 
[01:34:00]  so give them back.  Do they approve that he took your stuff,  or do they just know an agent was stealing?  An agent was stealing.  Of course, the same thing happened in Miami.  I had stuff stolen in Miami.  And then two months later,  I read, my AMI TSA agent arrested  for stealing electronics and stuff.  So what's their response?  We don't cover sunglasses.  We don't cover it.  Just a list of things they don't cover.  It's all the stuff they steal.  Yeah.  And that's why they steal it.  Exactly.  So they don't cover it.  So basically, if you have something stolen, 
[01:34:30]  like they don't cover electronics,  so if you have some electronics stolen  out of your suitcase,  you better say, pants.  So, you know, these are the people, what?  Just a mid-story coffin.  Oh.  Sorry.  I'm just, it's furious.  It is good.  It's furious.  It is.  It is furious.  Yeah.  Just, you know.  But, you know, Southwest,  you want to fly them,  but you're scared.  Why would you want to fly them?  Because they don't have a hub, 
[01:35:00]  so it's like, you know,  how do they work on a,  they land and go,  hey, does anybody have a hammer  we could borrow?  Or, you know,  we got to work on the plane.  And do any of you guys  have a lift that we could use?  Because they,  where do they work on their planes?  Yeah, I'm not even going to deal  with that airline.  Southwest.  Remember the old days  with the new airlines  and you go to this weird part  of the airport  that they just kind of  set up a makeshift place  to, you know, check in?  Like, what the fuck am I flying?  I love walking down memory lane  with you.  Yeah, a kiosk and a food court.  Right, exactly. 
[01:35:30]  I used to,  People's Express  used to pay on the plane.  People's Express.  I was doing drugs  and I had no,  I'd get on the plane  with no money  because I didn't.  I'm going to make believe  I've never heard this story before.  Should I tell it?  I actually don't know the story.  Huh?  I don't know the story.  No, I don't know the story.  I'm sorry  and I'll make believe  I don't watch you  in your nose after show.  You know you're going to get  you know you're going to get  a beating back  if you go after Rich.  But you have to.  But you have to 
[01:36:00]  because he is a quick motherfucker.  No, tell the people's story again.  No, tell the people's story again.  Dude, it was a joke.  We were just joking the other day.  We tell the same five stories  a million times.  Oh, what?  So we do the same shit.  I just didn't have any money  and I would,  because I do it on,  spend on drugs  then I would call the club owner  and say,  meet me at the airline  and pay for my ticket.  Because they would come down the aisle  to collect the money  and you go,  oh, I forgot my wallet.  It was the weirdest thing.  No ID you didn't need back then?  Wow.  No, man.  I would fly to,  I guess, Buffalo at the time 
[01:36:30]  on people's airline.  It was the weirdest thing.  You actually paid on the plane.  Hey, Rich,  I found your wallet.  You must have left it over my house.  Right.  And that's Continental  bought peoples.  They did?  Yeah, that's who  Continental took over people.  And it was cheap too.  How much was a flight?  Like, do it flights for $19.  Yeah, yeah.  $19 to like Buffalo or Boston.  Wow, that's crazy.  Yeah, that's about right.  $19.  There was something for $29.  Way less than $100.  I remember that.  And United is so, 
[01:37:00]  this merger makes me fucking sick.  It's not a merger to take over.  Yeah.  Because so many Continental employees  got fired.  They take over XM.  Terrible.  They say merger.  Yeah, it is like the XM serious.  Oh, God.  The merger.  And meanwhile,  we're the last bastion of XM left.  I don't see an XM sign anywhere.  Oh, no.  They would love to just chop the XM off the Sirius XM logo.  Oh, I do see it.  Really brilliant on their part.  And they...  Good move.  One of all the creative people.  That's smart.  That was the fantastic management at XM was fucking...  Well, the management sucked, 
[01:37:30]  but there's some creativity over there  that Sirius didn't acknowledge.  Yeah.  The giant...  The giant lead.  Financial lead.  Technological lead.  It's amazing.  Subscription lead.  Does maybe four shows a fucking month  while everyone else suffers.  Amazing.  Haven't had a raise in years.  What's up, Rich?  What happened?  Poor Sam.  What happened?  He's the only one who still has hopes and dreams.  Sam?  Yeah, that shit will go away.  He's got that youth,  and things are going to get better.  He's 30.  What youth? 
[01:38:00]  He hit 30,  and look, he's slumping already.  Yeah.  You're 30?  29.  Exactly.  That's 30.  That's 30.  Yeah, it's not as optimistic as it is.  He's got to work hard.  He's got to work hard and hope  because he's got a girl that's out of his league,  so he's got a fucking, you know,  he's got that going for him,  which means things like fucking house  and everything else,  so, you know, he's fucked.  He knows it.  He's fucked.  Okay.  Dave Attal.  Attal, take a seat.  The Grim Reaper just walked in.  Hey, Dave. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, jeez.  Good morning, guys.  Take that one right over there.  You must be very happy.  They got the guy who works at the kitchen at the cellar.  I know.  This is the finally anti-Arab headline.  Is it?  The post is more conservative.  Is that the Macy's Day Parade?  What is that?  Holy shit.  It's how horrible.  We're looking at the post.  Yeah.  How horrible is that?  That's your end,  where you're slowly being dragged by a low-end motorcycle. 
[01:39:00]  What's that?  A moped down the streets of Kaboom Avenue in Gaza.  The wonderful Gaza Strip.  Yes, yes.  That is a horrific picture right there.  I thought this was the upcoming Sons of Anarchy.  But they look like they're having a good time, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  I was asking, Ant,  do you just go back to your regular job after that?  Yeah, just go to work.  Back at the Rocket Tunnel Factory.  Whatever. 
[01:39:30]  The Rocket Tunnel Factory.  How do you pull off dragging a body to the streets  on the back of a motorcycle  and then go back to your regular job the next day?  God.  I hope he's not black,  because they would find a racer.  Exactly.  Oh, yes.  I understand.  You get so nervous talking about race, don't you?  Not at all.  No?  No, never.  You're not afraid to be called a racist?  Say the word.  What word?  Drop it.  Drop the big one. 
[01:40:00]  Unemployed?  Wow.  Illegitimate?  Good morning.  Wow.  Wow, David.  Tell him a really bad show, Romney.  You know what I also like?  If you study the picture the way I do,  they all use the same level of buzz clipper.  All the guys.  You see that?  It's like somewhere between downtown Brooklyn and...  All the Hamas.  A three.  Give me a three.  We're going to be dragging a body.  I want to look good.  And they all dress like Daryl Hammond. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, it's the picture of Hamas dragging the collaborator body.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  On the cover of the air post.  You don't see that on Homeland.  That's for sure.  No, you certainly don't.  Why would you?  Very realistic.  Wow.  It really is...  They've come quite a ways with the newspaper covers.  They wouldn't have shown dead bodies years ago.  Yeah.  They never really showed...  And they still have a problem showing dead American bodies.  Yeah.  They're like, well, we can't do that,  but this guy, who gives a shit?  Because we're so well hung.  We don't really know if he died. 
[01:41:00]  That is true.  Who knows?  Maybe he overslept for the Rocket Factory Tunnel.  That might be a reverse photo.  He might be actually dragging them.  It's a strongman competition.  Watch me drag 13 militants.  You know, there is definitely a homoerotic thing to it.  All the guys on...  You know, it's like, hey, man, you want to ride on my back?  We're going to be dragging a guy through the thing.  You know, you can hold on.  It's a little nervous.  Yeah, ride bitch for this one.  Yeah.  Yeah, it does seem...  Can you imagine sitting on the back of the bike, 
[01:41:30]  the smell blowing back on you?  Of just that whole region.  Let me see.  It smells like 5,000 years of...  And this one's got three guys on it.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's what I call the fucking home run bike.  Just got one guy in the middle.  Wow.  It really is a pretty fucked up situation.  We did kind of want to get Rich's take on it  because we ran through it yesterday.  A lot of people very confused over all the years,  very confused as to what the problem is there. 
[01:42:00]  Listen, I've been all over Twitter with this, okay,  arguing with your listeners that are pro-Ara and pro-Palestinian.  And here's the thing.  You can go throughout history,  the embassies in Africa,  the USS Cole,  the World Trade Center,  the bombings in Spain,  the bombings in England,  the World Trade Center again,  none of those perpetrators were Jews, okay?  So, and these are terrorist acts throughout the world, 
[01:42:30]  not only against Israel,  throughout the world.  So, what I'm saying is  not the most peaceful people on the planet.  What if the Palestinians say that  Israel's behavior in Gaza  is a form of terrorism?  What if Mexico says our behavior in Texas,  okay,  is unacceptable?  Oh, wow.  And then started firing missiles into Texas.  Okay.  Unprovoked.  What if Mexico wants their land back in Texas and California?  But maybe that's the answer. 
[01:43:00]  If instead of rockets,  they were sending in meth,  coke,  and, of course, pot,  then that would work.  Hmm?  We'll be right back.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  Can you do better with props?  All right.  Sorry.  I didn't know you were so ramped up on this whole thing.  They have the USS Cole.  I didn't know that.  What's the solution, Rich?  I didn't know you went for Blackwater.  I didn't know you...  What's the solution?  ...part of the global security net.  We need solutions here, sir.  Solutions?  What's the solution?  Yes.  Well, here's one of my solutions.  Being that Israel is no bigger than New Jersey, 
[01:43:30]  surrounded by, I don't know, what,  10, 15 Arab states?  Crazy.  Into Africa with Libya and that continent.  Why doesn't maybe one Arab state say,  hey, you know what?  We'll take some of the Palestinians.  That's what I said yesterday, yeah.  And you guys take some.  We'll do it.  But they won't do it  because it causes conflict against Israel.  Even if Israel gave Palestinians land,  they would still find another reason to attack.  Arafat, when Clinton tried to sign a peace treaty with Arafat, 
[01:44:00]  Arafat said, well, we want Jerusalem.  That's like America saying to Russia,  okay, we'll give you D.C.  It's not going to fucking happen.  They're not giving up Jerusalem.  So if other Arab states chipped in  and took some of the Palestinians,  then maybe there'd be a solution.  And even with the Palestinians being taken,  what's going to stop the crazy man in Iran  who's anti-Israel, who's building a bomb? 
[01:44:30]  What's going to stop him?  So how do you make him happy?  You can't, it's impossible.  There's too many enemies.  I like the fact that you just didn't remember his name.  He said the crazy man.  Ahmadinejad.  Oh, wow.  Ahmadinejad.  So what am I going to do?  I don't have to say it.  I stand corrected.  All right.  This is serious.  He remembers this because it's close to what he hears all the time.  I'm a total clod.  You can ask him. 
[01:45:00]  He knows.  He knows the stuff.  Yes.  It's fighting, you know.  So there's going to be no solution, obviously, ever.  The solution is what other Arab countries get involved and say,  we're going to help take the ballot.  Why would they do that?  Well, this is still going to happen because I do believe that Hamas is like the strong  arm of Iran right now.  And Iran's supplying Hamas with the missiles that they're firing indiscriminately into Israel. 
[01:45:30]  And Israel is using this as an excuse to get rid of these fucking missiles.  Maybe as a preface to an attack on Iran because they don't want...  Iran can't just indiscriminately shoot missiles into Israel right now.  But they can supply missiles to Hamas and then they could lob them in.  And that's exactly what they're doing.  And not only that, why this conflict is going on, it gives Iran more time to work on their  nuclear weapon.  Well, believe me, with fucking the shithead we elected into office, he's got all the time 
[01:46:00]  in the world to fucking do whatever he wants to do because no one is going to call him  out unless the United States is behind more than just these do-nothing sanctions against  Iran.  This motherfucker is building a bomb.  There's no doubt about it.  And he just got elected for four more years.  He can sit back.  You won't hear anything about jobs anymore.  You won't hear about fucking the economy.  It's done.  He's done.  He's got the job. 
[01:46:30]  I think you might be wrong.  Obama's been much tougher on foreign policy.  No, he hasn't.  That I would have thought.  He's had a couple of high-profile things that have gone on.  Of course, bin Laden, huge.  But that any fucking president, any president in office would have done that.  I cannot accept the fact that some president would have gotten that intel and gone, nah.  Nah.  No, no.  I think a president might have gotten that intel and told Pakistan.  I don't believe a president would have gotten that intel and went into Pakistan. 
[01:47:00]  Not this many years later.  Not with the history that Pakistan's had with fucking us as far as trying to get this motherfucker.  Any president would have fucking done the same thing.  He's targeting, he's doing predator drone strikes more than, I like the fact that he's not, he's doing a lot, his own base hates what he's doing.  They hate the way he's handling it.  And I love the fact that he's.  Because he just uses the base to get the job.  Now he's doing shit that, of course, the military wants to do.  He's, you know, he's not coming up with these battle plans for fucking predator drones. 
[01:47:30]  No one is.  But I'm saying he's.  No, there are people.  The CIA, fucking Homeland Security.  No president, I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  But they either take the fall or they get the credit.  I mean, Jimmy Carter didn't actually clean out those, whatever it was that caused the helicopters to crash.  But he took the hit.  Nixon didn't break in a, you know what I'm saying?  It all kind of.  But also when you have somebody that just decimated the military like Carter did, it was kind of his fault that they had inadequate equipment and training to go on a mission like that. 
[01:48:00]  So it all does come out in the worst.  When we overthrew the Egyptian government and took him out and put the Muslim Brotherhood in, who is a fraction of Hamas.  A what?  I said a fraction.  I know you did.  Holy shit.  Don't answer.  That's not the word?  No, it's a good word.  Keep going.  All right.  It is the word.  Okay, you would know.  A faction.  Greece is the word.  I meant faction.  You heard? 
[01:48:30]  I meant faction.  Early in the morning I make mistakes, but you know where I'm coming from.  The thing is, Egypt and Israel did have a peace treaty.  Yeah.  And Egypt, who is probably the biggest, most powerful country in the Middle East.  The biggest Muslim country.  Okay.  Now run by the Muslim Brotherhood.  Hey, then we can't cry.  We want democracy.  That's what they want.  They elected them.  Exactly.  Fucking stop saying we want them to have democracy.  Let them elect who they want.  Because it sounds all well and fine, but you know, Mubarak is another one of these guys who knew how to handle his fucking people. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  He was an ally of the U.S.  And people want democracy?  Let them vote in who they want.  Well, hey, let's just agree to disagree.  What are you going to do?  Drag me through the streets behind a motorcycle?  I just want to know one thing.  If Israel is the size of New Jersey, where is their Chris Christie?  Really?  Would that be Netanyahu's?  I think that's Perez.  Yes.  They needed four more guys to help drag him because he's fat.  Where is their Springsteen?  Who is the Springsteen of Israel?  Modi?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Who is it?  You ever been to Israel, Rich? 
[01:49:30]  No.  I was supposed to go when I was 16.  What kind of Jew are you?  Really?  Have you been to Italy?  No, but I don't sit there professing and tattooing Guinea shit on me.  Okay.  I've been to the Olive Garden several times.  The fucking horrible mansion you live in?  It's the curse of my people.  Yes.  You know, by the way, as was pointed out to me by Ray Abu Salim, and I did know this and  I forgot it.  Jesus Christ.  He won't be flying over the holidays. 
[01:50:00]  He has a tough time flying.  Are you thinking about the Oslo Agreement?  I think, because I believe the right of return was the problem.  That was, they would not, the right of return meant that Palestinians could come back and  the Israelis wouldn't sign off on that because that meant that eventually the Palestinians  returning would outnumber the Jews.  Right.  And they would be the majority.  Right.  So I think that was the main sticky point, was the right of return.  I'm not saying that's right or wrong.  I'm just saying I think that's right.  Well, also, too, Israel gave land back in Egypt after the Six-Day War, which they... 
[01:50:30]  No, the Yom Kippur War.  No, the Six-Day War.  No, they gave back the Sinai Peninsula after the Yom Kippur War.  That's what the...  73.  Wow.  Six-Day War is where they won all the land.  That was the win.  That's when every Jew felt they were tall and had hair and everybody was great.  67.  And they gave it back after the Yom Kippur War.  Yom Kippur, yeah.  Which they were attacked on the holiest day.  Or as the Egyptians called it, the October War.  See, they won't even agree on the name of the war.  I mean, honestly, we call it the Vietnam War.  What do they call it over there? 
[01:51:00]  The fucking United Nations has...  The Oliver Stone.  That's...  Go ahead, dude.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  It's too many...  Too many cooks spoil the broth.  That's it.  The matzo ball soup.  But I think the real interesting thing is the rocket.  I mean, a rocket attack.  Let's say you're sitting in your house.  Yes.  And all of a sudden, they blow a siren and it's rocket attacks.  What would you do?  Honestly.  What would you do, Rich?  I'd go into the basement or I'd...  Well, I'd get my golf cart. 
[01:51:30]  Not career-wise.  You'd get your golf cart.  I'd get my CDs and I'd build it.  So I'd hide behind my teeth.  I mean, like, that's the really scary thing about it.  They have, like, rockets coming at them from all these different places.  That is some crazy shit.  And Tel Aviv, which is the, you know, like, the hottest town in Israel.  It's, like, it's supposedly, like, the coolest town in the Middle East.  Like, Tel Aviv.  It's, like, you know, gay.  It's like Austin.  Yeah, it's like Austin.  They've got their own, like, south by southwest, mid-east by south something. 
[01:52:00]  You know, they've got a lot of...  A really good galleria there.  I don't know what they...  Yeah.  And a funny bone.  They've got a funny bone there.  They have a little kiosk for clitoral circumcisions.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, it can hit all the way through Israel.  So, it's pretty weird.  So, what would you do?  If I was the Israelis?  Well, I kind of take the different track.  I think the Palestinians should have some land there, you know, much like a reservation style. 
[01:52:30]  Like, where they get, like, you know, their rights and everything.  They can do whatever they want.  Sell cigarettes cheaper.  And then, you know, they should just get through it already.  I mean, it's, like, forever this thing's going on.  Now, okay, say they give them that land.  Do you think there will be peace in the Middle East?  I don't think there will ever be peace, mostly because that's the area of the world where people talk with their hands.  So, they're emotional.  Like, everything is very emotional.  Even, like, I think I was watching, like, an Israeli show, and it was just, like, pure emotion.  Like, it was one of their, I guess, like, good morning Haifa or something.  It was really just emotional. 
[01:53:00]  But I don't think there will ever be a peace the way we know it.  Okay, so there's never going to be peace.  Why weaken your borders if you know...  Well, people have the right to, you know, have a life and all that kind of stuff.  They were Jordanians before the Six-Day War, and all of a sudden, this whole Palestinian thing popped up, you know, after the Six-Day War, where six countries try to abolish Israel.  I know.  So...  They are in the middle of some shit there, aren't they?  Yeah, they are.  I mean, I'm not going to lie. 
[01:53:30]  I love hummus and falafel.  But not Hamas.  No.  Big difference.  You know?  I mean, the food is delicious.  Yeah, but what about, like, you know, the, whatchamacallit, the Syrian thing that's happening over there?  Are you worried about that?  Us, you know, like, they're having their revolution.  No one even cares.  Dude, there's a lot of dead people.  No one even gives a shit about Syria.  And we're not doing anything about it.  No.  We don't get involved in that.  Because that colonial, that documentary on Obama was interesting about how he's anti-colonial.  Like, the ones he's gotten involved with, or so-and-so, are where there's been a colonial influence. 
[01:54:00]  But in Syria, there's not.  And I guess in, uh, in Egypt, I guess.  Well, I was kind of propped up, uh, Mubarak was kind of seen as like a propped up U.S. ally.  But did you see-  So we kind of supported the revolutionaries.  In that documentary, the people throughout his life were all anti-Semitic, anti-colonial.  Who, Obama?  Yeah.  I mean, his professor, his mentor.  His grandfather.  His father, right?  All of them. 
[01:54:30]  Father, who was married, what, five times?  What?  What a piece of shit Obama's father was.  He died five times.  Obama's father, a lump of shit, that guy.  He died drunk driving?  Yes.  He died in a car accident.  He died in a car accident.  And he fucking was just fucking everything that moved.  Just an irresponsible lump of shit.  See, I would have said a great guy.  His son.  His son fucking idolized him.  And he was nothing but a womanizing communist.  His son never saw him.  You can't-  That's one thing you can't blame Obama for his father's-  Well, he should have said he was a piece of shit and not write a book about the fucking 
[01:55:00]  dreams of my-  Fuck you.  Well, his dad was supposedly really super intelligent, but he grew up in, uh, in, like, a weird thing  where he wasn't able to, like, you know, uh, I guess achieve all the goals that  he had, and he also-  His mom hated America so much, she had to go find anyone else to fuck than an American  guy.  Anyone else.  Where am I?  Fucking Kenya?  Give me some of that dick.  Where am I fucking, uh, uh-  Indonesia?  I'm in Indonesia.  Give me some Indonesian dick.  She's amazing. 
[01:55:30]  She's like fucking-  She's-  She's spreading a cunt open to Epcot.  But where-  She had one too many bad fucks.  Give me some respect for the dead.  Wow.  Please.  It's a holiday.  But I mean-  She's up over there.  I mean, you see-  You're supposed to be thankful.  You saw the movie.  All the professors-  Yeah.  Everybody was pure anti-America, anti-Israel.  People hate America.  Yeah.  These-  These-  I mean, and they were-  They were his influences.  Major influences on his life.  Right.  So-  You grow up in that, uh, you know, you- 
[01:56:00]  Atmosphere of just literally communists.  It's not just, oh, that guy's a communist.  No, this guy identifies himself as a communist.  His writings are communists.  And-  And he's one of the mentors that Obama had.  It's just-  And besides communists, anti-Semitic.  And also, you know, you're-  I don't mind that part.  Yeah, well-  Yeah.  The thing is, why can't we disagree without being violently disagreeable?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Yes.  I didn't make that up.  That's an excellent point.  You want a bagel with some lox?  Uh, I was kind of hoping after that whole Jew-y Jew talk, 
[01:56:30]  Okay, you're going to pull out a nice ham, ham and rye.  You know, like a real-  Yeah, he's a trooper, Rich.  Right.  And that's what I think.  A kielbasa?  Anybody?  How long is this-  Can this last without it going bad?  Ten minutes.  What are you eating there?  It's, uh, cream cheese and lox and capers.  When did you get it?  Wow.  Oh, capers.  Nice.  Did you take it out of a bomb shelter?  Wait, you just bought it.  Yeah, capers.  Well, how long does it last?  You don't like capers.  Why are they crying?  How long does it last before it stinks up the room like bad poon? 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  Like ten minutes.  It is a kip-el.  That's a weird early morning.  On the road, you don't eat that.  What are you talking-  This is a good breakfast.  It's light.  I don't know what it is.  There's no way you're going to find Jew food like that.  Wait for a break.  Where are you?  You're going to have a discussion and you're going to eat a bagel.  Yeah, we got some of that right behind this tree here.  Jew boy.  Let's come back here.  That's where you're all.  Glock kosher.  Where can I find it here in Pittsburgh?  When I go on the road, I go to the supermarket, I buy my food, and I bring it back to the hotel  and put it in the refrigerator.  Wow, you're fascinating. 
[01:57:30]  That is so-  This guy wants in on your-  We know exactly where you're staying at.  The comfort in.  Yeah, exactly.  The bedroom thing.  Kevin in New Hampshire.  I put it in the refrigerator near the hot plate and the three spoons you're afraid  to touch.  I love those.  I love those too.  Me too.  And the horrible coffee maker.  I walk in, I immediately flip the mattress out of habit.  I just flip it over.  Fresh start.  Let's say hi to Kevin in New Hampshire.  Kevin.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Jimmy's right.  Anthony, you're wrong.  You've been saying for a year now that any president would have gone in and did what 
[01:58:00]  Obama did.  Oh, here we go.  Hey, Google it.  Google it.  Google it, dude.  Every Republican-  I don't get that.  What does he mean by-  Every Republican railed against Obama during the first campaign in 2008 because he said  that he would do that.  They all called him naive.  Shut the fuck up.  They, look.  Hey, hey, hey.  No, they didn't say-  So they said-  So Obama said, hey, if we find bin Laden, I'm going to kill him.  And Republicans said, oh, stop it. 
[01:58:30]  That's terrible.  Yeah, what do you mean, sir?  They were looking for him.  Shut up.  You fucking revisionist history lib cunt bag.  Fuck you and your mother's cunt.  Wait, sir, what do you mean?  You cunt.  Shut up.  What do you mean?  Shut up, lib.  Shut up, lib.  Lib, shut up, lib.  Hope you fucking have-  Enjoy your four years of fucking destitute.  Enjoy four years of poverty.  Enjoy four years of fucking socialism, you dirtbag. 
[01:59:00]  Man!  Man!  Go occupy something.  But wait, what did-  Occupy his mother's asshole.  What did Obama say that-  Hold on.  Dude.  Because you're fucking wrong and you know it.  What did Obama say-  The debate from 2008.  What did Obama say he would do-  I stopped killing it.  The Republicans said they wouldn't do.  The Secretary of State said she would not do that. 
[01:59:30]  It's naive to think that that's the right thing to do, going into a sovereign country and killing.  Everybody said that he was naive for doing it, and to say now that anybody would have done it is bullshit.  I thought it was great what he did.  What did you do?  He went into Pakistan without their knowing, because they sucked.  They're the worst allies ever.  They're a terrible country.  They're horrible.  And, you know-  Terrible.  I thought it was great that they did it.  Yeah.  And it was in Islamabad, which is like their-  It's a really nice neighborhood. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, George Bush wouldn't have done that.  Oh, that's right.  He just launched into fucking Iraq with everything.  Shut up.  He wouldn't go into Pakistan without permission.  Yeah.  He fucking sent an army to fucking Iraq for no reason.  So shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  And take your greedy little paws off my tax money, you cocksucker.  You cocksucker.  You're a cocksucker like your father.  Shut up.  Sounds like me and my mother arguing. 
[02:00:30]  That's what I do before sex.  I just like I could yell for two seconds and he just keeps going.  Here's the thing, too.  You know, when they brought Bin Laden, which is great for morale, it's like when they put  Gotti in jail.  We didn't stop the mob.  You know?  Yeah.  There's so many.  There's a different figurehead than Bin Laden was.  If you're trying to say Gotti took down the towers, I'm going to smack you.  Come on.  Oh, okay.  What are you saying?  Joe in Boston wants in.  He has a lot to say. 
[02:01:00]  Joe.  All right.  Hey, guys.  So, Rich, just like most other Jews who live in a state of denial, doesn't seem to understand  that Israel was created under false pretenses where people were booted from a land that they  already lived in.  A war was started immediately after it was given to Israel, and Israel just summarily  got rid of them.  Well, first of all, the anti-Semitic United Nations voted that that's the homeland for  Israel, okay?  Unlike every other country that was taken, all right? 
[02:01:30]  America was taken from Israel.  So, how about post-war?  There were a lot of fucking nations that didn't want to be under the Soviet Union's rule.  That's what happens in the world.  People are thrown out of some places.  Other people get in, and then it happens again the other way around.  But that's what happened.  So, what's your fucking problem?  Here's my problem.  The fact that Jews here and in Israel bitch constantly, oh, there's rocket attacks, and  there's Hamas, and there's Hezbollah. 
[02:02:00]  Why do you think that happens?  Like, that's fine.  History is what it is.  That happened.  I get it.  But the fact that you're wondering why this keeps happening is unbelievable.  Because they're savages that just are intent on killing people based on nothing but religion.  They cut off their own women's clits, okay?  If a woman gets raped, they kill her, okay?  These are not fucking, these are not peaceful people.  You know what?  That does, I gotta say, that does strengthen the argument because, like, you're saying cause 
[02:02:30]  and effect, they wouldn't fire rockets for no reason.  It has to be a root cause.  Well, Americans are so fucking naive, they're trying to rationally think out these people's  ideas for doing shit.  Cause they're animals!  Cause they're fucking animals!  The same group does, the same religious mentality really does fucking execute rape victims.  I mean, that really is hard to justify.  So how do you make peace with these irrational people?  Right.  Okay?  This guy's saying that the whole Jewish state is irrational. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, he's saying it's a big mistake.  Tell that to the United Nations that voted, that's the state.  No one takes that seriously.  Because nobody else, fucking England wouldn't take them.  They were kicked out of every country in Europe.  You can't blame them.  Well, then obviously, then obviously, there's a problem.  Go to any, go to, have some room for us?  We would like to stay.  I have my breakfast bagel and it stinks, but can I stay in your house?  This fucking guy, go to Nobel Prize winners and see how many fucking Arabs have contributed 
[02:03:30]  to society like the Jews have.  Okay?  When you're in the hospital ready to have heart surgery, who would you rather have looking  down on you?  Should you shut the fuck up, you idiot?  Okay?  Because you know what?  You're just another fucking liberal, self-hating Jew, probably, pro-Palestinian.  Go fuck yourself, okay?  No, this guy doesn't like Jews.  I was going to go pro-Palestinian, but I blew my knee out.  Can I please get a word in?  Yeah, let him get a word in.  Hey, did you get my CD yet?  Did you buy my CD?  Wow.  Rich, I came to see you and took a picture with you. 
[02:04:00]  You couldn't have looked more miserable.  The first good point I've heard out of him.  I don't take good pictures.  Finally, a valid argument.  Why don't you take good pictures, Rich?  I don't know what it is.  You've been out in a long time.  Maybe that's what they need over there, more pictures together.  Where did you see me?  What place?  All right.  It was at...  The two places you were.  Come on.  Hold on.  Exactly.  Which here?  Which restaurant did you see him at?  Stand up in New York or the other place.  All right.  Go ahead.  I was at Vinny's...  All right.  So, anyway, I saw him at Vinny's Place. 
[02:04:30]  It was a good show.  Stress Factory.  Cousin Josh's.  Which always puts on a good show.  You won't even recognize Vinny's Club, this guy.  Why?  Stress Factory, right?  Yeah.  Why?  Stress Factory.  What am I?  Give him a plug?  I'm not doing this.  No, this kid, he wouldn't even say Vinny's Place.  I'm like, you know, Israel and Stress Factory.  Recognize it.  Go ahead.  Sorry, Rich.  All right.  Go ahead.  Sorry, I got...  So, go ahead.  You were saying Mengele is a hero.  Exactly.  I was looking at that the other day.  I hate to interrupt you, Rich.  But did you... 
[02:05:00]  You know when they caught Eichmann?  Yeah.  And, like, they had that trial in Israel?  And, like, the whole time he's smiling.  Like, do you think it was, like, this weird thing of, like, look at these Jews putting  on this trial.  Like, you know, like, it's, like, special needs kids, like, they're playing baseball.  Like, you couldn't fathom that it's actually going to work.  Yeah, like, he's the umpire at a special needs baseball.  Like, you're out.  Whoa, you're a real slugger.  Like, pretending they're normal and human.  I was just thinking about it, because he has that weird smile the whole time.  Like, look at this adorable trial by the Jews. 
[02:05:30]  Go ahead.  I'm sorry, Rich.  No, son, mate.  Joe, your final point, please.  I thought his name was Rich.  So, I'm not just, like...  I'm not, like, some liberal idiot.  Like, I got a fucking master's degree in this shit.  I studied it for 10 years, right?  So, I'm not some liberal idiot.  Well, he's unemployed.  Okay.  Argue with Anthony.  He's smarter.  Well, no, like, I'm not trying to argue.  I'm just trying to make a point that, like, if you don't try to see it from the other side,  like, this is just going to keep...  Yeah.  You're seeing it from the other side with eyes that cannot possibly fathom what's going on there. 
[02:06:00]  You're thinking...  Americans think of things in terms of America.  Very short-sighted.  How is it that you totally just throw away the fact that there's a religion over there  that is based on violence, hate, overpowering the weak, women have to be uneducated and killed  if they're raped because they caused it.  Like, how is that looked at?  And then you go, well, the reasonable reason they would do that. 
[02:06:30]  No.  You've just got to label them what they are and what they show themselves to be every  day.  Fucking animals.  I mean, okay, say they have...  Say their conflict with Israel, why are they blowing up trains in Spain, subways in London?  Mainly on the plane, though.  Yeah, exactly.  You're insane.  Too bad you don't have a brain.  My interest in you will really wane.  One thing you've not done in show business is gain. 
[02:07:00]  Silly Jew, just go ahead and complain.  That's a spoken word Williamsburg style.  That was very meta.  Very nothing hipster.  Why is it everywhere they go, they leave a trail of destruction?  No, they don't.  That's not true.  Yeah, all these bodies are just laying.  What about when they come here?  They're really hard workers and stuff?  You see them like working at the delis and stuff like that?  Yeah.  They're great.  Not the fringe, but the main. 
[02:07:30]  No.  They're not like...  Anthony is labeling like an entire group based on the idea.  Yup.  So few, it's ridiculous.  Yup.  So few.  You used to be...  Anthony, you used to be a lot smarter than this.  Like, what the...  No, I wasn't.  You were bamboozled.  I've always been a fucking idiot.  Okay, but so what are you saying?  What's the solution?  You tell me the solution.  Sure.  The final solution.  You go back to school.  Oh, boy.  There it is.  It's anti-Semitism.  Throwing out the Norway in them.  Whipping out the Norway.  What's the solution?  The solution is, A, like, it should have been dealt with like 60 years ago. 
[02:08:00]  But the solution now, like, there is no solution because Netanyahu and Likud have been settling the West Bank for years to the point where you could not create a two-state solution.  So he likes to just, oh, we have a little peace agreement.  Let's talk about it for years and years.  Exactly.  That's true.  We're going to keep the settlements going.  And now there's no way to deal with it.  And then they fucking, they assassinate this guy, Al-Jabari, knowing that it's going to start rocket fire.  Well, but...  And then they can say, now that then they, that basically is their end to start another problem in Gaza on the eve of election, of an election cycle to make themselves look strong. 
[02:08:30]  But that was a super cool strike.  People are dying in the problem.  So that hood go flying?  That car hood?  My final point is just, like, if you look at these rocket attacks that are supposedly such a huge problem in southern Israel, if you look at a chart of the years of which these happen, they go flying up after every major Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip.  So who's fucking starting what? 
[02:09:00]  Wow.  Rich, comment?  I don't know.  I got tired, man.  No, I think...  Oh, you weren't listening?  I kind of was listening, but it just hit me out.  Wow.  You started this.  I didn't start it, Anthony.  Ask me my opinion.  All right, Joe.  I don't know what Madrasa that kid went to, but he knows his stuff.  Using their puppet fucking Iranian missiles.  Those motherfuckers, anyway.  Then with their puppet missiles.  But with the Iron Dome system.  Yes.  All right, we're going to...  Why did we pay for the Iron Dome system, by the way?  That annoys me. 
[02:09:30]  Why?  Because we have our own money problems.  Why the fuck are we helping?  And Israel's a great ally, but they have enough money to do that themselves.  How much money do we fucking feed into Egypt?  Exactly.  Phenomenal point.  Give them zero.  I agree.  Yeah, and the pyramids.  That's all I know about it.  Right.  They're trying to build big hats for the pyramids.  They think about tourism.  They want to see it from space.  But how cool is that, that Iron Dome thing, where they're shooting down, I think, only 30%  of the missiles, though?  Yeah, yeah.  But I guess that's a win.  It's great, but let Israel do it. 
[02:10:00]  They can afford it.  According to Jewish baseball.  Why don't we talk to David, who's in Israel?  Yeah!  Our pal, David.  David!  All right, good morning, Hope.  Iron Dome, where there's no wrinkled shirts.  Now, this is a real Jew right here.  What's up, dude?  How's it going?  Where are you?  Super Jew.  I'm in Georgia.  I just got back yesterday.  What?  No, he was in Israel yesterday, matter of fact.  Oh, the Tel Aviv to Georgia flight?  I don't...  I told you guys yesterday, but I got disconnected.  This should have been going on for 12 years.  The only time it ends up in the news is when all of a sudden Israel decides to retaliate. 
[02:10:30]  They've been sending rockets on and off for about 12 years.  It's been going on for a very long time.  Only when we finally decide to take out one of their assholes for what they've been doing  to us, all of a sudden, then the world decides to go ahead and pay attention.  They've been intentionally attacking civilians.  When we go after them, we merely go after the Americans over there.  We do have casualties.  Israel is the only country that supports the enemy in the fact that we're supplying them 
[02:11:00]  with their water supply.  We're supplying them with electricity.  Fucking Egypt is not helping out.  Lebanon is not helping out.  Syria is not helping out.  We're the ones giving them power.  We're the ones giving them water.  When they go in to attack and blow up their buildings, they drop leaflets and call them  to let them know, hey, we're coming to blow your shit up.  You may want to get out of there.  They can't leave, though.  There's countless videos on YouTube showing them hiding behind their own civilians.  I mean, you're dealing with a bunch of savages.  It's not that we one day came in and killed one of their guys, and then all of a sudden, 
[02:11:30]  you know, they're retaliating with rockets.  The rockets have been going on for a very long time.  No.  This is Dan.  But the whole thing is that they have them kind of locked down like a jail over there.  So that's why the people are going a little nuts.  But you're right, dude.  And the way we got to West Bank, the way we got that entire area, is we were sitting  in April 67.  We got attacked by them.  And in six days, we took out flea punching.  Fuck you. 
[02:12:00]  You lose.  You come.  You start.  I didn't know El Al was pumping helium into the cabin of their aircraft.  But did you know Gaza was never a part of Israel?  Did you know that that was like the one area that was never part of the Judea state?  It was the Phoenicians, I believe.  Correct?  The Phoenicians.  Yeah.  Remember those people?  Just because I had them in my living room.  Yeah.  You can't see them.  The blind.  Yes.  Yes.  Their motto was done.  Phoenicians.  I believe it's something like that.  Yes.  But he's right. 
[02:12:30]  The guy's right.  I take his side, too.  David?  You know, we left in 2006, and this is the thank you that we got.  This is the thanks you guessed.  They left that flower shop there.  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  It was terrible.  They left like this whole rose hydroponic garden there where they were making flowers.  It was like a really nice gesture.  And then they started shooting the rockets, and then the Israelis immediately blew it up.  I'm sure.  I thought that was great.  Grenade factory.  They blew it up.  Yeah.  F-16 came in a wank.  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  We'll take out your flowers. 
[02:13:00]  Well, what are you going to do, guys?  I mean, honestly.  I mean.  Yeah, David, what's the solution there?  I think they should cut it and turn it into like a floating island.  Oh, that'd be nice.  There you go.  Like a pirate.  Like a state island.  Oh, David.  Rich, you're so pissed.  I'm sorry, man.  You have to carpet bomb them and just make it one big show.  Whoa.  Carpet bombing.  Nixon Jr.?  In this day and age?  At a comedy club, you can't even say the word whore.  I mean, come on.  It's crazy. 
[02:13:30]  I think the world has gotten very Muslim-centric, very Arab-centric.  Yes.  Europe loves the Muslims.  It's very hard to do anything that even seems against the Muslims these days.  Europe does not love the Muslims.  No, they hate Israel.  They do.  No, no.  Look at France.  They're banning fucking religious headgear.  I know, but they don't like Israel, though.  They hate Israel.  Maybe they don't like Israel, but I'm saying they're not pro-Islam either.  They're making the Jews put tellers on those yarmulkes.  Which is so weird, because for years, Europe was so into Jews. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, they really...  In the 20s, 30s, and 40s, they were so like...  You couldn't buy a drink as a Jew.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry, Rich.  Go ahead, dude.  I'm slowing down your political firing line here.  I'm done.  You're done?  That's it?  Yeah, I'm thinking about my...  The tattoo show I'm doing Monday.  What is it?  It's a tattoo cover-up show on, like, whatever.  Oh, that's cool.  They think every village was murdered?  You get one of yours covered up.  Yeah.  Which one? 
[02:14:30]  I love Palestine.  No, the tribal piece up here.  What are you getting it covered up with?  Huh?  What are you getting it covered up with?  Are you having...  You should...  What are you getting it covered up with?  It's up in here.  They're going to do the best cover-up artists in the country.  Why would you do that?  It's a good tattoo.  Oh, great.  I don't like to tell you that here.  That's a cool tattoo, right?  What are you getting...  What are you getting put on it?  Huh?  What are you getting put on it?  Roses across the top.  Why?  Because I don't like the fucking tattoo.  The best cover-up artist, and that's all he can do, are roses. 
[02:15:00]  Right.  Roses are like the easiest cover-up.  It sounds like anyone could do that.  This thing is hard to...  Here, just take your shirt off.  Take your shirt off, for fuck's sake.  Here he goes.  Do it, you.  Wait to see his abs out, dude.  Leave that shirt in a pile.  It will be returned to you later.  The showers await.  After the shower, we will return your clothing.  Bread and good work on the other side.  You will rejoin the rest of your family.  That's a family camp.  They didn't, though.  What happened?  We didn't see it.  No, they didn't.  We didn't see the tattoo.  What happened with the tattoo?  They're doing it next week.  What are they covering?  What part?  Yeah, we want to see the tattoo they're covering. 
[02:15:30]  Wait, you've got a tattoo of Jesus on your back.  What kind of Mexican are you?  You've got like a spiky thing, Asian writing, a swallow.  It's stupid.  What does that mean?  It's a cool tattoo.  What is that?  What does that tattoo mean?  It's a tribal piece.  What tribe are you a member of?  Yeah, what tribe?  Oh, God.  Did you just pick it off the wall?  You picked number 28?  It means nothing.  That's a great...  A tribe called the Dunces.  What are you calling?  Who's talking to you?  Nothing.  I'm in studio with Atel and Norton and Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:00]  They don't want to be here, so it's just horrible.  I can't do this anymore.  We need some background music.  Yeah, I'm on the air.  So is she.  Tell her.  You have to tell her.  Unfortunately.  It's all right.  Can we ask Bonnie a question?  I mean, Opie's doing crossword puzzles.  Bonnie.  What do you want to ask her?  I want to ask her...  Yeah, put her on speaker.  Tell her about the tattoo.  Are you on speaker?  Bonnie, you're on speaker.  Bonnie, can you hear us?  Hello?  I'm talking to you.  All right, Dave from Israel.  Hey, Bonnie, if you can hear us, Rich was telling us a story how he was trying to shove 
[02:16:30]  something up your pussy the other night and you weren't into it.  Oh, my God.  Kind of beverage container.  I said no.  No, I know you said no, but what was it?  It was his...  I don't know.  He drinks it for bodybuilding.  Cum?  You bodybuild, Rich?  Yeah, David Tell.  So, Rich drinks this shit because he's bodybuilding, I guess.  Are you juicing?  He decided that's what his wife needed and he snuck it into bed and she was very aware 
[02:17:00]  of what was going down.  So, you're trying to give it to her anally instead of orally?  No, I can't even go near her ass.  There's no way.  If a finger just rubs on her back of her leg, she freaks out.  Because you don't know how to take charge, stupid.  Get in there.  What if you blew a horn and said, rocket attack?  Just put your face in there to hide.  Did you mention that it was ice cold?  It was just out of the fridge. 
[02:17:30]  So are you.  Yeah.  You want to shove this ice cold thing up her.  Dummy Arbuckle.  So, it's a performance enhancement, Bonnie?  What is it?  It's like a tube thing.  It's like a...  But he thought that this would be good, a nice cold tube thing.  It looks like a vibrator.  Okay, well then get her a real vibrator.  Yeah, what's the matter with you?  How'd it go down, Bonnie?  How'd it go down?  What's that?  What happened?  Yeah, what happened?  She's on a speakerphone.  Oh, I told her to get away from me. 
[02:18:00]  How's wrong with you, Reg?  Was he being sexy about it?  He tried to be sneaky about it.  I thought he bought a vibrator.  I was like, why is it so cold?  Oh, man.  Cold, much like the Jew in their mind.  Figured he'd get a budget vibrator.  Bonnie, do you ever get into fights with Rich over political stuff like we just did?  Do I what?  Party with him?  How much delay can it be since you're outside in the car? 
[02:18:30]  She's in Tel Aviv.  There's no way you guys pay for parking.  What do you call it?  Tel said, do we ever get in political fights?  Yeah, like about Israel and all that stuff.  You're welcome to Tel Aviv.  I thought you were Canadian.  Same thing.  That's true.  I gotta go.  You guys know the others.  Bye.  What was that about?  Why did she have to go?  Oh, jeez.  All right, let's break.  That was, yeah.  David Tel, you're promoting the DC Improv, right?  But that's next week.  Yeah, this week is the third installment of the second season of Dave's Old Porn with Amy Schumer and Robert Kerman. 
[02:19:00]  Nice.  We're watching a holiday classic on Thursday, which is Thanksgiving.  Debbie Does Dallas.  Nice.  Oh, that is a classic.  I missed the first season.  You don't have any.  No, I don't have your phone number.  Oh, okay.  But you missed the first season?  Yeah, as a guest.  Oh, okay.  Well, we didn't have the, you know, I didn't have any of the beheading porns, which you would have been great at.  But, yeah, no, I'd love to have you on, man.  All right, and then I'll tell you next weekend at the DC Improv. 
[02:19:30]  And, Rich, where are you going to be again this weekend?  I'm at Gotham this weekend, Friday and Saturday.  Two shows Friday, three Saturday.  We've got an author coming in talking about hotels.  The inside scoop on hotels is next.  An expose.  Heads in beds.  Jacob Tomsky.  Talking about the Israeli Hilton.  Yep.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:20:00]  La, la, la, la, la, la.  All right, where's our author?  Yes, we have.  Day before Thanksgiving.  Jacob Tomsky is coming in.  Book looks good, man.  It's called Heads in Beds, a Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles, and So-Called Hospitality.  You know, we've been talking about hotels many times on this very program. 
[02:20:30]  Last time we had a discussion about the wonderful Carter here in Manhattan.  I wonder if he has any information or experience on that.  It's just a hotel guy?  Yes.  Hi, Jacob.  Hi, hotel guy.  What's going on?  You know everybody in the room?  That's the very funny David Tell to your right.  The very funny Rich Voss to your left.  The very funny Jim Norton.  And then you've got me and Ant here that, you know.  And the very, uh...  And that's, uh...  Sam Roberts.  The very...  Androgynous.  The very Sam Roberts.  You're sitting between three guys that every week pretty much stay in hotels around the country. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, that's true.  Every week because we're on the road.  They're the comedians, you know.  They're traveling all the time.  Absolutely, absolutely.  You know anything about the Carter Hotel here in New York City?  That's the one where everyone gets killed at, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  They have a few stories.  A lot of murders, yeah.  Murders and then, uh, like, like, uh, horrible conditions.  Very dirty.  I think bed bugs.  Something like that.  Uh, bed bugs are everywhere, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah.  Are they literally everywhere in every hotel?  Uh, not in every...  Well, you know, you never know. 
[02:21:30]  I mean, they're in cabs in movie theaters.  Oh, shit.  I don't even think about that with these filthy fucking people getting in cabs.  Put your jackets down.  It's scary to me.  What are you talking about, bed bugs?  Yeah, yeah.  I was talking about black people.  Wow.  Jesus.  Wow, rich.  Rich.  He just wrecked everybody's good times.  No, we're having a good time.  My God.  I didn't know he said they were everywhere.  I just made him uncomfortable.  So you don't have anything on the Carter Hotel, though?  No, no, no.  Just, you know, I think people were murdering babies and whatnot.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's one of them, like, Times Square.  Like, off Times Square.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is the buffet like, the continental breakfast? 
[02:22:00]  It's actually surprisingly tasty.  It's been the worst hotel in, like, uh, the city, certainly.  Holy Jesus.  There's a lot worse hotels than that.  Come on.  I would bet.  Yeah.  Honestly, the old school, like, Elton Lodge and shit.  Look up, uh...  Overlook.  Look up the Carter Hotel on YouTube.  You'll be amazed.  You'll be amazed with the graffiti and the locks broken, and it's unbelievable, this place.  Today, I got a four-star hotel today for 90 bucks on Priceline.  Congratulations, Josh. 
[02:22:30]  What's the book about there, Jacob?  Uh, it's just a memoir of my life in the hotel business.  Uh, all the, you know, crazy shit I've seen from the guests, uh, some celebrity stuff in  there, uh, and then on the back end, you know, tons of tips, especially for four-star  hotels, you know, how to get an upgrade, uh, how to get a late checkout, all kinds of  things, uh, that can happen.  Don't you just call and say, I want a late checkout?  Yeah, no, I'm gonna say no.  I'm gonna say no, sir.  Unfortunately, uh, we're sold out tonight.  But why do you have to be assholes and say no all the time?  Yeah, why do you always say no?  Being an asshole is part of the job, actually. 
[02:23:00]  Why?  Just fucking, I want a late checkout.  Everybody wants a late checkout.  Yeah, you have to check in late.  Why can't you leave late?  Indeed, I've heard that complaint.  Thank you.  Repeatedly.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I'm gonna get an early check-in today, and I know how to do it.  But why do they make it...  I got tips for all this, man.  I'll tell you.  Well, how about the smoking rules?  How come there's, like, every hotel has non-smoking now?  Like, why is that?  I know, I know.  It's ridiculous.  People complain, you know, like, they can smell it in the room next door.  The room does stink.  Everyone's got allergies and all this.  Yeah, but is it a state law, or is it just, like, the... 
[02:23:30]  No, it's property-specific.  Okay.  Yeah, but now it's, like, trendy.  You know, but what I would do, you know, check in, you know, have a cigarette, and then  call down and complain that the room smells like smoke, and then move to another room.  Oh, man.  Excellent idea.  There you go.  That's a good one.  Continue doing that every time you need a cigarette.  That's a good one.  But there's no advantage to them allowing you to smoke.  No.  Because it's a fire hazard.  It's not going to make the room better.  It's going to make the furniture stink.  There's zero advantage to the hotel allowing you.  Right.  Yeah, but what if it's Vegas, and, like, you're a Japanese billionaire-type guy, and you flew 
[02:24:00]  in, you want to chain smoke or something?  Oh, Vegas, you can smoke.  You will.  That lets you smoke.  If you're a billionaire, you can do it.  Yeah.  You can do it every once in the park.  You can smoke whenever you want.  I got one of those questions that, of course, everybody thinks about with hotels.  When you try to check in, and they say there's no rooms available, come on now.  Are there rooms?  That's a huge...  That was one of my favorite lies.  Yeah.  No, there's nothing I can do, and there's no hotels.  There's always rooms left behind, you know?  And that's one of the awkward situations.  So why are you guys assholes?  Yeah, why? 
[02:24:30]  Hey, hey.  Wow, you wrote the book.  Yeah, between that and having to tell everyone they can't have a late checkout?  I mean, what's the motive?  Well, you've got to manage this property.  I mean, it's like you've got 100 rooms, you know, and then you've got 120 reservations.  They'll overbook a hotel because it's about a 10% cancellation rate.  So they play the numbers game, but somebody's going to get screwed, and somebody's going  to get walked to a hotel, and you don't want to walk, like, let's say, you know, there's  nothing available for a one-nighter because we can walk them to another hotel, put them 
[02:25:00]  up, and then we don't have to bring them back.  So you want to make sure you have rooms for someone who's there for four nights.  So there's a lot of different reasons.  And then if you book the $90 rate, you know, you're going to get walked to.  You want to hear my solution to the no rooms?  And it's worked many times with me.  I've walked around Manhattan looking for a hotel sometimes and been like, no, sold out,  sold out.  And you just know they're sold out.  So I go into a hotel, and it takes a little while because you've really got to be adamant  with this.  But I give them my credit card.  I go, reservation, Anthony Cumia.  And they're like, and I know they ain't finding it because I don't have a reservation. 
[02:25:30]  But I'm adamant.  And I'm like, I called yesterday, made this reservation.  It's very important.  And they keep looking.  They go, I'm Mr. Cumia.  I'm like, I go, I have nowhere else to stay.  You're going to put me up at your house?  And it takes a long time because they've got to go to a manager.  They go in the back.  They talk.  But then they've always come back and said, okay, we got something for you.  There's two good ways to do it.  If you can manage to be a screamer, you can pretty much push through some walls. 
[02:26:00]  The other way is...  Why is that?  Because they don't want a disturbance in the lobby.  Yeah.  It's just, I mean...  No one wants to do it.  Isn't that like a light view?  They want you to go away.  Yeah.  Scream as hard as you can.  Yes.  You're pretty much wherever you are in whatever situation.  Something's going to happen.  The other way, actually, is tipping the front desk agent.  Really?  Yeah.  That works.  All the time.  That's something that a lot of people don't know.  These are the people, like you said, tippy-tapping.  They're the ones that are deciding who will be fate there.  I am a greasing motherfucker.  I love them.  We can tell you.  Greasy. 
[02:26:30]  I didn't say greasy.  But I'll tell you something.  A lot of times when you go to hand someone something, they go, no, I can't do that.  I can't.  And then they're like, they have some kind of fucking morals.  When I'm trying to get a room, god damn it.  You always take care of the people that are funny.  You give them 20.  I've been to fucking, whether it's to Barkley or whatever.  For $75, we got four stars, and they bumped us up to a suite because we do them fucking extra money.  But what if you throw to the tip and they can't do it?  Like, what if you say, hey, can you upgrade me? 
[02:27:00]  And you offer money, and then they take it and go, no.  Oh, boy.  You know, that's a pretty soulless bastard, and that happens.  But generally, because the front desk agent is not a tipped position, the fact that you give them money, like, immediately I get nervous.  I want to do something for you.  And it's not always about an upgrade, and that's the thing that people don't realize.  These rooms are all different.  You know, the rooms are all the same size.  Have you ever heard that?  That's one of the biggest lies in the hotel business.  There's always a room on the corner.  There's always a room with a better view, a bigger bathroom that fits a rollaway.  You know, everything's perfect in certain rooms.  So I can find the best room of your category, not to mention if anybody here likes to drink, I can go ahead and throw bottles of wine, you know, or amenities when you're getting your late checkout. 
[02:27:30]  So what your money can do for you through the front desk, it might not be an upgrade, but you might have no idea what this person can do for you.  What's a good tip on the front desk?  Five bucks?  Yeah, a quarter.  That's a quarter, sir.  That's a quarter, sir.  Just flip them a quarter.  Yeah, maybe George Washington needs a little more room.  I would say, you know, a 10's a good start. 
[02:28:00]  20's quite nice.  20's nice, huh?  You know, a 50, I'll carry you up to your room if you want to.  That's it.  Scoop you up.  We stayed at the Carlisle, and it was so fucking overrated.  I mean, that and the other one, I mean, these are like, you have butlers come to your room.  I hate that.  Yeah, yeah.  I hate all the fanciness.  Private butlers.  I like a where you can do your laundry.  I was just like, that's my favorite hotel where you can do your laundry room.  A laundry room?  Really?  Yeah, because I'm on the road all the time, so you get to do it.  Like, you know, these cheap-ass, you know.  I like a gentleman's hotel.  I'll tell you, when you go on the road. 
[02:28:30]  You're hitting your cricket bat and a cheese plate and you're on your own.  When you go on the road, when you go on the road, like, you can either stay in town,  but if you can get, like, a Hampton & Sweets, you get breakfast, free high-speed, free parking,  a workout with high-speed.  No, but you get everything, and it's so much better than being in town at a dumbbell.  Free cable.  Free HBO.  What is it, 1980?  Free electricity.  Free electricity, yeah.  Free electricity, yeah.  And the pool, they clean it.  No, I'm telling you, I go on the road all the time. 
[02:29:00]  We have color TV.  Cool.  So what's the dirtiest thing in a room?  Like, we know the duvets.  The duvets are balls.  I like to call it the bedspread.  Do you wash those things, or what?  You know, you got the duvet cover, and they're going to wash that, but the feather inside  of it, yeah, that's not too often washed, and that'll suck up some fluid.  Oh, yeah.  Fluid, that's very gentle.  Yeah, and then if you're in, like, a budget motel with that scratchy blanket that they  try to hide between two sheets, that thing's disgusting.  Another thing people don't know, the minibar glasses, right? 
[02:29:30]  The housekeepers are responsible for cleaning that.  If you look at a minibar, if you look at a housekeeper's cart, there's no dish soap  on that cart.  So they're cleaning it with whatever they can, which is going to be-  Tears.  Which is going to be-  The tears of the-  See, that's going to leave spots.  You cry on a glass, it's going to have, you know, cry spots on it.  So they'll use shampoo.  They'll use-  Why can't they have a little dish soap?  That's hilarious.  I don't know, man.  Maybe they should start.  Maybe that's my mission.  I never use them.  Never drink out of those glasses, because they're dirty. 
[02:30:00]  They clean them with Pledge.  I cleaned it all the time.  Yeah.  It leaves a spot-free glass.  It just-  Pledge.  So how did you get it?  Did you go to, like, one of these hotel management and whatever schools?  You didn't do any of that?  I started parking cars.  Okay, so you worked your way up the whole ladder of hotel.  Do you get a lot of pussy working on the counter?  Can you get a lot of pussy, like, from the ladies coming in by themselves?  Pussy?  What do you mean?  Pussy is a thing when a guy-  Oh, pussy.  Pussy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have a speech impediment.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you said pushy, and I was like, yeah, I've got some pushy ladies in my face. 
[02:30:30]  No, but I mean, do guys, like, do they offer you sex, like, late at night?  Yeah, yeah, the lonely trophy wife.  There's one from Canada.  Especially the bellmen.  The bellmen are getting laid up in them rooms.  Really?  What about the maids?  Do they hook on the side?  No, no, I remember that.  I don't think so.  They're too busy working hard, man.  That job is difficult.  Yeah, that's an unforgiving job, isn't it?  Why is it difficult?  You know, I worked-  Trying to figure out how to get the cum out of the sheets? 
[02:31:00]  How do you get cum out of the sheets?  I think you just, you know, burn them.  Watch them.  Protein gets out protein.  I saw that on the other.  What's the weirdest-  You just throw it in the washer.  It takes itself out.  What's the weirdest, like, late night, like, somebody calls up, hey, do you got a, you know,  something, like a banjo and a something?  Like anybody?  You know, I had a celebrity.  This was actually, I was in New Orleans.  I was a housekeeping manager at the time and had a celebrity.  He was in town filming a movie.  Famous actor.  Brad Pitt.  No.  And he was, I'm going to say no to whatever you say.  Was this during the show, Tremol? 
[02:31:30]  Can I get some gumbo and a sex work?  Look at that disgust in your face.  I'm sorry.  I liked it.  All right.  What do you got?  I'm a celebrity.  This guy, he is a super freak, man.  He had bags of pills in his room, like, and I'm not talking fun pills.  Well, that limits it down.  I'm not talking fun pills.  I'm talking, like, nutritional pills, like a bag.  Like, I couldn't even stomach it.  And he asked for the, we had these big silver potpourri bowls, and he calls down, and he wants  five of them.  And so I hustle.  I steal them from rooms.  He said he wanted to eat cereal out of them. 
[02:32:00]  And these things are going to fill a whole, the whole box.  You could dump it in.  He also asked for, like, an acupuncturist and a voodoo doctor.  Wow.  And a therapist, all at the same time.  Like, it was an emergency.  He calls down.  He's like, we need a voodoo doctor now.  What year was this?  That was, like, 2001.  He's still out there.  What movies came out?  He's still out there doing his shitty things in 2001.  Mohammed Atta.  Right.  Yeah.  A voodoo doctor.  You might have given away the celebrity.  Yeah.  What movie came out around 2001, 2002? 
[02:32:30]  Space Oddity.  Space to New Orleans.  That was just because he was in Space Oddity.  You got that one wrong.  That's because he was in New Orleans, though.  I have another question I've always been very curious about with hotels.  Sure.  Obviously, you unwrap that nice soap.  You use it for two seconds.  You pop it up there.  It would seem a horrid waste for the hotel to throw all those away, but you can't just  leave them in there.  What the fuck happens with the unused soap?  Go.  You melt it down and remold it, right?  That's right.  Yeah.  We just carve it down to a small or so. 
[02:33:00]  Ah, that's right.  No, no.  All that's thrown away.  Those little...  It's kind of sad.  Especially even those empty shampoo bottles.  They're little tiny jobs.  Yeah.  You take like half of it.  It's like a rule in a luxury hotel.  There's usually like there's a symbol for the hotel.  And if it gets below that symbol, then you have to replace it to make sure it's full.  And it's just they're just throwing that away.  Yeah, but that hotel shampoo, I mean, you never like leave a hotel and go like, where can  I pick that up?  It's always some like weird idea.  You'd be surprised, man.  I used to laugh my ass off when guests would be like, your mattresses are fabulous. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, really?  What mattress is this?  I'm like, I don't know what damn mattress this is.  Some of those things on top of the mattress in some hotels are the most comfortable.  Yeah, the pillow tops.  The pillow tops.  Some of them.  I've been to some of them that were so fucking comfortable that I don't have an answer.  That's usually what it is.  It's not that it's a Serta Sealy Plus.  Not to interrupt Rich's trip down comfortable memory lane.  I wanted to throw in an interesting fact, too. 
[02:34:00]  Like, one time I was in this hotel and the TV was just crisp.  See how awful it is?  No, you said in the article, I think, in the post that people, they actually come in and  really look through your shit.  Like, they actually do do that.  Do they?  Sure.  I mean, well, you know, when you start working at the hotel, you know, it's like real voyeuristic,  man.  I see you going out and, you know, everyone, we all have master keys, man.  In any room, anywhere, any time.  And looking through your shit, that's not bad. 
[02:34:30]  It's when we start fucking with your shit that it really gets dirty.  Oh, man.  You know what I mean?  Like, how do they fuck with your stuff?  You know, things done to toothbrushes.  Oh, man.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yes.  Is that true?  I've never done that.  That's an urban legend.  Why would they do that?  Yeah, if you were a prick, you know, you make a...  Nicolas Cage, what?  Yeah, you scream at somebody.  You make, like, a racist or homophobic comment.  Oh, I'm going to hide my toothbrush.  I'm going to screw you.  You yell at...  Like, people yell at me, yelling at the doorman in front of me. 
[02:35:00]  And I'm like, that's my boy right there.  That's my friend.  Don't yell at my friend.  I'm going to screw you.  Oh, man.  You're calling your boy.  Oh, jeez, Rich.  It's like Bad Boys the movie.  How about you guys just mind your own business?  Take all the...  Yeah, what about the ice machine?  I mean, is that normal?  I mean, like, what is that?  It's a machine that produces...  No, I know, but, like...  There's all the ice there all the time.  Do you guys ever, like, clean that out?  Or, like, I mean...  Yeah, I don't think you're going to have any problem.  You know, all these...  You know, I don't think you're going to have any problems with the ice machine there.  Maybe the bucket.  You know, the bucket's probably pretty gross.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't you ask about the soda machine? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, what about the soda machine?  You know, we'll have to go to Coca-Cola.  No, I figure...  And also the hotel pool.  Like, I feel like it's very un...  First of all...  Every pool, right?  Yeah, it's just, like, filthy for some reason.  Even, like, in a big hotel, whatever.  Unless it's outdoors.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, it's not a lot of chlorine in hotel pools, you know, it's...  In hotels, you gotta...  You know, you take all the blankets off, you lay under one sheet, and you just turn the  heat up.  You're fucking...  Don't touch.  You put your, uh, fucking channel thing in a plastic bag. 
[02:36:00]  In a plastic bag or a sock or a sock.  No, just use it.  Who cares?  Sleep in the tub.  That's what...  Well...  Let me tell you something.  If you get in that tub, it's one of the worst things you can do in a hotel is to take a  bath in that fucking disgusting, jizz-stained, hepatitis tub.  Who's ever stay in a nice...  Who's ever stay in a nice room?  Huh?  Who's doing that in a tub?  Jesus.  What if you're handicapable and that's your only way?  Yeah.  Well, fuck in the tub. 
[02:36:30]  I stay in very nice hotels.  Stay in nice hotels.  The tub is, like, fucking great.  Yeah.  That's one of the hardest things to clean, too, man.  Cleaning that tub is so...  What about...  I never use it, but it's always fucking weird.  Well, we can see that.  You know, like, uh, crime scene cleanup people, and I'm sure you've had them in your hotel.  We did a thing with me on the Insomniac thing years ago, and the guy told me that if you  ever go in a hotel and there's, like, carpet, like, the carpet doesn't match, that usually  means there was either blood or some other kind of thing, and they cut it out, and they  just put it in the carpet.  Is that true?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:37:00]  There was a situation we had where a kid had rented a room.  His father was rich, and his father couldn't get in touch with him, so he called the hotel.  He was concerned.  And, you know, I talk about this in the book a little bit.  And then he comes up, and the security opens the door, and this kid is covered in blood.  He'd been cutting himself all day.  The robe was open.  He was totally dazed.  He was on drugs, and there was blood all over the hotel room, and they had to have crime  scene come in, and it was, like, a $20,000 cleanup. 
[02:37:30]  No, he didn't die.  He didn't die.  He was totally dazed.  Did they charge him for the cleanup, at least?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They charged his daddy for the cleanup.  They put it on their bill?  Yeah.  And when are you guys going to update the laundry thing?  I mean, trousers and top hats and all those different crazy Titanic things.  Bowler hats.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Slave leash.  I mean, it's always...  I'm always trying to do a joke out of it.  It's, like, really weird.  Trousers and...  Yeah, those tails.  The worst is the iron.  The iron.  I was about to get a cape laundered here.  And the fucking irons that are attached to the ironing board. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who's going to really steal an iron?  Do people steal everything?  Everything, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They will steal everything.  I was staying in a hotel, and they stole the batteries out of the remote control.  Hell, yeah.  That is, like...  That is ghetto, dude.  That's grimy.  That was a grimy.  And they is a word for you-know-who.  People that need batteries.  Yes, battery.  Battery needers.  So bed bugs, how many hotels have them?  Because we checked the bed bug registry before we go to a hotel.  Bed bug registry, I've heard that.  It's actually pretty good.  What's up with the bed bugs? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, what can you tell us about them?  Well, you know, like, I had this situation where this lady...  You know, first of all, I've had these people come down, and they're like,  and they're like, look at...  This is a bed bug bite.  This has got to be it.  And I'm like, I'm not a goddamn doctor, man.  I don't know what that is.  It looks like, you know, a mosquito bite.  I don't know.  But, uh...  Yeah.  And they'll bring down little bugs in bags and, like, forensic evidence and stuff.  They bring it in with them, probably get a free run.  Yeah, whatever.  But, you know, and I got into this one lady, because she was like...  Oh, nice.  She was like, you have bed bugs here.  This is a...  This is a...  You guys are on the bed bug registry. 
[02:39:00]  You're like, how do I know you don't have bed bugs?  And I was like, look, how do I know you don't have bed bugs, man?  You just traveled in a cab.  Man, yeah.  Wow.  You know, you were just in an airplane, right?  You know, these little guys are international, man.  They're jumping about.  So don't bring bed bugs into my hotel, please.  That's how you really answered that?  No, no.  I said I'm...  That's what he wanted to say.  It's like, wow.  No, no, no, no, no.  Because it's been a ripe up there.  But usually a four-star hotel won't have...  Did you feign that you were from, like, Poland and go like,  Mia, the whole world right here, you know?  Like they always do with me.  They never speak the known language of the moment. 
[02:39:30]  But usually a four-star hotel won't have bed bugs, right?  Yeah, they do.  That's not true.  What'll happen...  Well, they're a little cleaner.  What'll happen is it's going to happen in one room.  And then what you do is they shut down that one room.  And then if you find out that your room did have bed bugs,  obviously that's going to get comped.  And then they'll shut down the rooms to the left and to the right of it.  And they'll bring someone in.  And then they'll fix it.  So it's not going to be the entire hotel.  It's going to be one room.  And then they're going to clear out the rooms around it.  And it'll be fine.  But what if they don't know?  Like what if one of them hops on the maid cart and they start spreading?  Yeah.  A little bed bug babies. 
[02:40:00]  We're just working there.  Good point.  It's a ballet.  These bed bugs.  Here's a question, which is like I think every...  Like I've seen a lot of hotels that were haunted or was said to be haunted.  Like Austin and Boise, Idaho.  Like they have these like legendary haunted hotels.  Do you...  Have you ever had that experience?  I mean, you're there all night long in that lobby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It gets kind of spooky.  Yeah.  So has there been ever like that kind of thing?  I mean, I don't really believe in that kind of stuff.  But I mean, when you start thinking about all the people who have murdered each other  and died and killed and suicide, I had this one guest who his sister murdered herself 
[02:40:30]  in the room.  At suicide.  And then he came back and he only wanted to stay in that room.  Wow.  And it was really weird.  Yeah, and it used to like really make me sad.  Wow.  But yeah.  But yeah, late night, you never know.  It's a spooky place.  It's a spooky place.  Because I was in a hotel one time and like people were coming down going like, I can't  sleep.  There's something horrible, you know, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  Let's go back. 
[02:41:00]  I want to go back to that story.  Do you ever tell the guy, sorry, but that room's taken tonight?  Yeah, that was it.  There was a situation he would call and he'd be like, can I have, you know, room 1227?  Yeah, I'm like, sorry.  Someone else has that.  Someone else is using that room for suicide.  All right.  That's what happened in room 237.  1220, it's coming.  That's a horny room now.  I understand that too.  That movie will be a horny.  Wow.  By the way, great thing here.  You're talking about somebody who you worked with, I guess, who said he learned how to  diffuse guests' anger. 
[02:41:30]  Because guests would, like, if you're too meek and sympathetic, that will fuel their anger.  Or if you throw back your thing, if you throw back your shoulders, it seems unsincere.  But he said he would one-up their anger.  Like, if a guest came back from lunch and said, I came back from lunch, my room hasn't  been cleaned.  Anyone planning on cleaning it?  That the guy would, Andy would go, what?  I can't believe they failed to clean.  And then angrily push the buttons.  And fucking one-up your anger.  They can't do anything at that point. 
[02:42:00]  And then it makes the customer's defense.  You're just as mad as they are.  No, it's okay.  It's okay, sir.  You know, somebody's going to be fired over this.  Yeah, yeah.  But that unsympathetic, that phony, I'm sorry, I can't.  That does make me angrier.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You gotta know how to deal with it.  Well, I do apologize, sir, for any inconvenience.  That insincere, company-line apology makes me sick.  I mean, I got good at the front desk of gauging people.  You know, I could tell by the time you entered the lobby what type of person you were and how 
[02:42:30]  you wanted to be treated.  You know what I mean?  If you wanted the professional service, I'm going to give it to you.  If you wanted me to be, you know, relaxed, cool, make jokes, fine.  You know, I got kind of good at that.  And what about the hot cookie?  Like, why is that?  Like, when did that become the big thing?  You know, like when people check in?  Is that a thing?  Hot cookies?  Yeah, like you go to a hotel and they go, which is like a nice-  Oh, that's at the Hampton Suites.  Hot cookies.  Yeah, like give you a hot cookie and a bottle of water.  So that you're a whole day's meal looking for jobs.  I came here, I didn't get any hot cookies.  That's true.  Well, I'm just saying, you know, I'm sorry.  Oh, here's another thing. 
[02:43:00]  And this front desk guy, this will, a lot of people have thought of this.  I use a computer.  I got my little mouse.  I point and click.  I can find anything in the world.  It's very simple.  Why the 8,000 keystrokes?  You're looking.  Yeah.  It's like, I got a reservation.  Here's my credit card.  Click, click, click.  And then back to this again.  What the fuck are you doing?  Well, I got two things.  I became a supreme hustler at that front desk.  And sometimes when you're trying to extract a tip for an upgrade, 
[02:43:30]  I would fake type all the time to make it look like I was working.  You already got your room.  Wow.  But I'm just sitting there like, hold on, sir.  I hate that.  I'm just like tippy-tappy.  Oh, man.  Because it makes you look like you're working.  Like you're working.  But actually, I mean, these systems are, there's a lot of training that goes on there.  They're very complicated.  And what they're doing is swapping your room out.  Because you've got 500 rooms, 300 of them are dirty.  They're coming back all the time.  You're blocked in a dirty room.  And you've got all these requests.  So I've got to find another room from another guest.  Swap that out.  Replace that guest's room.  Make sure everyone has a room and all the holes are filled. 
[02:44:00]  So there is a lot of work going on.  Point and click, motherfuckers.  Here's another thing.  I see you hit that goddamn return key eight times once.  I don't know what that was all about.  How come room service takes like an hour and a half?  Like why is that?  Oh, man.  You know, that's one tip.  Like even you order like the most basic thing.  Just give me what you're eating.  Yeah, like a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper.  Snappy.  It does take a long time.  You know, that's one of the, you know, in the book, that's one of the tips.  You know, oftentimes you can, and it's, of course, over, overpriced and then it's going 
[02:44:30]  to come over cold.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  So you can actually order delivery in the area and then, you know, wonderful restaurants  are going to deliver, right?  And then you can call room service and ask them for the plates.  So just like if you want to have your little fancy silver dish.  I'm not going to do that.  Get them to send that up and then put your, you know, you know, outside delivery.  But they're going to deliver that food hot and cheap.  Your Domino's pizza on top of it.  Yeah.  But then when I leave the room, they're going to just take my toothbrush and shove it up their ass.  I've learned that.  Well, they don't care.  But the housekeeper don't care if you don't care, right?  That's why I don't brush my teeth.  That's a good plan.  Back to the ice machine. 
[02:45:00]  Wait, I got a question for you.  He sucks him every night.  After I leave here, I'm checking into my hotel and I got to get in early.  Sweet.  So I'm just going to walk in with a sob story.  Look, please.  Give Rich a sob story.  Let's see if this works.  What can Rich do?  A slob story.  It's a biography.  The 20 bucks.  Saps story.  Here's the thing.  Billy Bob Ford was the guy.  And I know there's available rooms because people check out.  Sure, sure, sure.  So there's a clean room.  I haven't forgotten.  So shall you offer him 10 or 20?  Kind of those two guys.  10 or 20. 
[02:45:30]  Here's an even better tip for that, actually.  If you call ahead, you know, like you've got, we do, like, okay, if the room, if the hotel  was 60% occupancy last night, that means 40% of the rooms are actually clean in the morning.  And people who are coming in super early were giving out those rooms.  So if you call ahead, if you had called this morning and said, you know what?  I just got out of the airport.  I'm on my way.  Can you pre-register me into a ready suite?  Hey, fuck that.  Let's do it right now.  Well, see, I did price lines, so the hotel's a price line.  All right, call them up.  But still, no, when you're calling out.  Rich, we got an expert right now. 
[02:46:00]  Let's do it.  Let's see if this shit works.  Yeah, call them up.  We'll sell a lot of books if this works.  Heads in Beds is the name of the book we're talking about by Jacob Tomsky.  Yeah, and so I'll do this, but the reason I don't like doing it, because if they say  no now, then I'm screwed when I get there.  What should I say?  Call the hotel.  Let's do this.  Let me find the number.  Oh, boy.  Can we still talk while he's doing it?  Yeah.  Now, bed and breakfast, on the scale of one to gay, where is that in your world of, like,  what do you think of that whole experience, bed and breakfast? 
[02:46:30]  Well, the funny thing is, you know, as I've been working in hotels my whole life, which  allowed me very little time to actually stay in them.  I know, but you must know people in that, like, the other side of the business.  I did one stay in one bed and breakfast.  They're all swingers, right?  Yeah.  I'm hoping for some action, right?  It's a creepy vibe.  Yeah, they're like, breakfast is at seven.  Fuck that.  I want to walk around the room, throw my clothes anywhere I want, fucking eat when I want,  leave that shit all over the place.  And then when I'm in, like, the shower, I don't give a shit.  Like, at home, you know, you rinse out and wring out your washcloth. 
[02:47:00]  After scrubbing your ass crack, that thing gets swacked against the wall.  Yeah.  Fuck it.  And I don't want a bed and breakfast where I've got to worry that I'm going to, you know,  embarrass myself in front of somebody.  Fuck that.  Yeah, you've got to see the same people, like, all the, you know, the couple, and then they're  needs that.  You know, retarded kid who lives in the garage.  Right.  In Europe, all the hotels have, like, a free breakfast.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, but that breakfast stinks.  Are you kidding me?  The ones in Holland? 
[02:47:30]  In Holland, not England.  You might remember, like, Rich, he doesn't have a book out, but he runs a website called  WorstFacts.com.  You can work anywhere in the country, or in the world now, because you have that experience.  And, like, have you, like, gone, like, the third, like, you know, whatever, like the  Ramada and, you know.  Yeah, like international travel.  I mean, when I did that, you know, I was obviously shoestring, you know, I've been, you  know, poor.  What's up with the pillows?  Do you get, I was just going to say, do you get offended when somebody like him walks 
[02:48:00]  in with their own pillow, and to, like, saying your pillows?  It's sort of, it's not a good look.  I know.  Yeah, we got pillows.  But I don't walk in with my own pillow.  Yeah.  Hotel pillows.  Kenny carries it.  Plus, pillows are nice.  I heard you checked out of a hotel on the road, because you didn't like the pillows.  No, here's what I do.  I'm a bad sleeper to begin with.  By sleeper, he means person.  By sleeper, I mean, fuck.  I'm a quick, lousy sleeper. 
[02:48:30]  But the thing is, I can't, a lot of the sheets are itchy.  Like, in the Westin, I cannot.  Why are they itchy?  Dude, they just drive my skin crazy.  Overwashing.  Overwashing.  I mean, you wash something.  I mean, imagine.  They're stiff.  Courtyard by Marriott, I sleep in those fuckers.  Because the sheet, whatever their bedding is, it's a corporate decision, because the bedding  is just comfortable for me.  I've checked out of five-star hotels to go to a courtyard, so I sleep better.  I cannot sleep in a fucking Westin.  I wish I could.  Dude, I can nudge. 
[02:49:00]  My skin's very sensitive.  All right, so I'm going to call them.  What do I, are you going to talk or me?  No, you're going to do it.  So talk.  See if you can pull this off.  Use the term pre-register.  If there's any available rooms, I'd love to be pre-registered.  Okay.  And don't tell them you'll be there.  Tell them you're on your way.  Yeah.  Because the important thing is that they're, like, they want to take care of each other.  You're already, oh, oh, it's 930.  And don't say what hotel it is.  When Skyfall is going to be on the movie slides or not?  Available now.  Still in theaters.  Don't say price.  Make sure you tell me about them.  I got a great tip.  Don't use an extra. 
[02:49:30]  Is this the front desk?  Hi.  May I have the front desk, please?  Why, thank you.  There you go.  It's nice right there.  Good question.  Good start.  You got to, you got to, uh, Vegas 2.  Pre-register.  Pre-register, remember.  Yes.  You can't.  I want to pre-com, I mean.  Who's going to do it?  Who's going to do it?  This poor front desk agent.  Let him, let him get, let him get through. 
[02:50:00]  Let him get the name out.  We gotta let him get through this.  They're letting you ring hard, dude.  Yeah.  They're staring at that phone ringing like, I'm not getting it.  They can't get my number, can they?  My number doesn't go through.  No, no, no.  They can't get it.  No, no.  They can't get it, Rich.  Relax.  Why?  They got my number, did I?  You're calling from here.  It's fine.  Why do you care?  Oh, there you go.  Hi, how you doing?  Listen, I just flew in and I, I really need to, uh, pre-register and check in early if that  would be possible. 
[02:50:30]  We do have rooms available now for check-in, so whenever you're on.  Give me your name, stupid.  Oh, you do have rooms available.  Tell me your name.  Can I give you my name so I know, uh, when I get there that you'll have it ready?  What is the last name?  Uh, V as in Victor, O-S.  Voss.  V-O-S.  Richard?  Yes.  And make sure that room is ready, bitch!  Make sure that fucking room is ready, you bitch!  I'll be there, you cunt!  Make sure that ready is your fucking room!  He fell for it. 
[02:51:00]  He ran out of it.  He got caught up in his headphones and couldn't get out of the room.  He almost, he almost strangled himself.  He almost strangled himself.  He couldn't get out of the room.  He ran out of the room and got tangled in his headphones.  That's dope.  Oh, is that hilarious?  Almost tripped it to the door.  He tried, he tried so hard to cover the phone up.  Wow.  You know, that worked.  But why would he fall for that?  That worked.  Yeah.  It's pretty good.  It was good that he went that one step farther and said, you know, just, if you could, just 
[02:51:30]  I want to make sure to pre-register.  Pre-register.  My last name is...  Rich, were you panicking a little?  You're in?  Yeah.  Good to go.  Yeah.  Now, now we've got...  So give him a tip.  She said, give a tip.  I already saved on the tip.  I'm in.  Give him a tip.  Yeah.  I'll take that.  He's still in the business.  I'll take money.  But you know what?  Another thing to do, at that point, now what you've done is you've dealt with a really nice  front desk agent who took care of you.  Remember their name.  Write their name down.  Oh.  And then when you get there, now you have a contact.  And you're like, oh, you know what?  I spoke to you this morning on the phone. 
[02:52:00]  You helped me out.  Thank you so much.  And then that's a good point to give a gratuity.  But also, now you have a personal contact.  And she's like, oh, I did help you.  And now you're not just, you know, like a discount-seeking guest.  You're like a nice guy that called in a personal relationship.  Kilo of Coke in your bag when you leave.  Listen.  Say.  Better than warm cookies.  Listen to me, book peddler.  I don't give a shit.  Oh, wow.  I got my fucking room.  Go fuck yourself.  I'm done with you.  Wow.  Why so mean, Mitch?  He helped you.  Rich.  What's up, man? 
[02:52:30]  You all right?  Rich is abrasive.  I got yelled at my whole life, man.  Nobody can.  I got thick skin.  Yeah, right.  How are you going to shock him?  I'm going to tip her when I walk in.  That's a kind thing to do.  She sounded very interesting.  Oh, I just learned something.  What?  Hotels don't have a 13th floor, so this book doesn't have a 13th chapter.  Consistency.  Superstitious dummies, aren't they?  That's true, though.  He doesn't have a 13th chapter.  You know the fear of the number 13 is called Triscodecophobia?  You don't have a 13th strand of hair.  What do you want? 
[02:53:00]  That's just mean-spirited.  Why are you attacking poor Opie?  What the fuck?  I thought Jimmy was on Rich's page when he quoted that.  What are you eating?  I'm eating turkey chili.  Wait, what did I eat?  It's not too shabby.  It looks delish.  Wait, what did I say?  I was on Jimmy's page.  Triscodecophobia.  You know, useless fucking information.  What do you call it?  What?  Triscodecophobia.  I think we've all learned that.  Yeah.  But the hotels do have the 13th floor. 
[02:53:30]  It's just called the 13th floor.  Giving Rich shit.  I know.  He's like, yeah, look, we all know that.  Let's move on, Rich.  So when you're in town, like, where do you stay?  I mean, like, you must be like a provider, like the Solomon Rushdie of the hotel world.  And I was like, well, you know, I stay in my apartment.  You know, I live in Brooklyn here.  But, you know, I'm going to do some traveling.  You know, I'll be in New Orleans for, you know, book tour in Asheville.  So I'm very excited to stay in these hotels. 
[02:54:00]  And, you know, I hope one of the things I did in Heads in Beds is really just accentuate the struggle of all the positions.  So I'm really hoping that any, you know, hotel workers out there listening, they really like what I've done, you know.  Oh, they're going to be able to relate.  You know, it's definitely more it's a worker.  That's your ball in the spot.  Yeah.  You've watched those videos where the maid walks in and the guy's, like, jacking off on the bed and he hides the camera.  I've been in that video.  Those are hilarious. 
[02:54:30]  The guy's, like, jacking off on the bed and he sets a camera up and leaves the door open and takes the Do Not Disturb sign off.  And he's just jacking off.  And eventually the maid comes in and he gets her on video going, like, oh, and shutting the door.  It's fucking hilarious.  I can't wait to see it.  It's great.  There's a bunch of them.  You got whores in your book.  There's a lot of dirty business in that book.  We haven't talked about the whores.  I was, yeah.  Bring your own whore, you call it.  Yeah.  B-Y-O-W.  What's that mean?  B-Y-O-W.  Well, that hotels are the brothels of today. 
[02:55:00]  It's just now.  It's just a, you know, bring your own whore situation.  Oh, right.  You rent a room.  You know, you got a lot of businessmen.  You know, actually business people that, you know, they live in Connecticut and then they get a room for the week in New York because they're working.  You know what I mean?  There you go.  But all they use that is, you know, like a whore palace.  And then they got the internet to get the girls from.  Absolutely.  So now you got your home base.  Do you know when the whores are coming through the lobby?  You can, some of them are, some of them are quite obvious, you know, and then you got the subtle ones.  But really what, the best thing that they can do is all they need is a room number. 
[02:55:30]  You know what I mean?  They don't need, they don't need anything else.  So it's, it's only a bad whore would come to the desk and ask where she's going because it's just, you know, it's like her first day on the, on the job or something.  You usually don't have a room number.  So they just go straight up.  So, you know, it's very, very subtle.  When a girl comes in and she's tall and she has an Adam's apple, will the desk clerk know what comedian she's going to see? 
[02:56:00]  Long explanations of the obvious.  Yes.  Oh, that's great.  I wasn't sure which comedian he was talking about.  Of course you are.  During the hurricane.  Were you looking for umbrellas?  Supposedly supposed to happen.  It's windy.  Hotel rooms on price line were a thousand to four thousand a night.  That's correct.  They were price gouging.  Gouging.  Now, that's against the law.  It is.  I mean, during that hurricane, they were a thousand to four thousand a night.  The attorney general in New York is going after people on Craigslist who are doing that and hopefully in Jersey. 
[02:56:30]  I think Chris Christie doesn't probably tolerate that shit either.  But they were, every hotel in New York.  Oh, New York.  Upduring fucking prices to a thousand.  Interesting fact about that kind of situation, any kind of storm.  You actually have to lodge the hotel workers in the rooms as well because they can't travel.  All the trains are down.  So some of the rooms are taken up by the staff.  You need to run the rooms.  I used to do that all the time.  They'd put us in a room.  We'd party so hard, man.  So if you walk in and they say it's a storm and they say it's two thousand a night now,  are they legally allowed to do that?  And what's your recourse if you walk in and you know their price gouging? 
[02:57:00]  It's not a $50 difference.  I'm a front desk gate.  I'm not a lawyer.  I don't know.  It sounds illegal.  It sounds like bullshit.  But I don't know.  Say you're already in there.  I mean, as a business owner, it seems legal, right?  I don't know.  There's a certain thing with price gouging.  Again, I don't know what business is.  When is it a commodity?  Like gas, you can't do it.  But like a hotel room, a place to live seems like a commodity.  I don't know.  It's an interesting question, actually.  I bet you could raise the fucking price, but if another hotel has a cheaper rate, you'd  go there.  But if there's price fixing, there's probably an issue. 
[02:57:30]  Then again, they do do it during the parade, along the parade routes.  There's huge...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  New Year's Eve.  Huge price.  Yeah, exactly.  For views, you change the rates.  Yeah, New Year's Eve, the rate goes way up.  That's an amazing thing about hotels.  It's like the same room the night before could cost you twice as much the next night.  Absolutely.  With no difference in the fucking room.  A lot of fluctuation, yeah.  It makes no sense.  Yeah.  Well, but say you're in the hotel.  Based on availability, it's like a math equation.  You know, as the percentage of the hotel goes up, 65, 75, 85, the rates start to go up 
[02:58:00]  because the rooms are at a premium.  What is your opinion?  Say you're stuck in there, a storm comes, and you can't get out.  You were there for $100 or $200 a night, then you can't get out of town, and now they're  $2,000 a night.  What the fuck?  What's your recourse?  You can't get out of the hotel?  Yeah, why?  Is it that windy?  No, because there's nowhere to go.  There's nowhere to go.  They don't care.  He's already hunkered down, and he's going to stay there.  Well, now you know how a fucking Palestinian feels, you Jew. 
[02:58:30]  Do I really?  They have no reservations.  Nowhere to go.  They're kicked out of the place.  Yeah, see?  They came, the little soaps.  Yeah, but they never paid for the original night there.  Wow.  But what about...  And they'll never use the soaps.  Now, have you ever worked on a cruise ship, which is more of like a sea hotel?  A sea hotel.  Hotel at sea.  I was really close.  I heard that's a great gig, man, because it's like, you know, I'm sure it gets pretty  wild on a cruise ship. 
[02:59:00]  But you work long hours.  Yes.  You work long hours, but your room and board is taken care of.  And then you're visiting these stops and all that.  That's cool.  So they pay you at the end.  So it's like they dump you off back on your own shore and then just like give you a ton  of money.  I always wanted to do that gig.  That does sound cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was this close, you know, but I never went that way.  That must be a wilder scene, but they probably have it like locked down because like you  said, I would think that whole staff is just banging each other the whole arm.  Anything else about the book?  Anything we missed in the book there, sir, you want to mention?  A ton of, a ton of.  What did I ask? 
[02:59:30]  Anything else you want to mention?  Yeah.  Well, back to the movies, you know, there's some information in there about how to steal  if you guys are interested.  Wow.  You're really giving up the whole...  That's cool, man.  That's really important.  For example...  For example...  Movies are like 15 bucks a pop in a hotel, sir.  Absolutely.  And that's a subscription service that the hotel pays, right?  So it's not...  It's like they don't lose any revenue and those things cut off all the time.  Yeah.  They freeze in the middle.  So if you enjoy your movie, you know, and enjoy Skyfall, whatever you're talking about,  and then just call down and be like, you know what? 
[03:00:00]  I ordered the wrong movie.  It cut off in the middle.  You know, it froze.  Whatever you want to say and it's going to come off and that's at no loss of revenue  for the hotel.  Same thing for the minibar.  How do you get out of play?  Really?  Minibar.  Wait, the minibar, they don't lose anything?  No, they do.  But I mean, you got M&M's, you're paying $7.  Yeah, you can replace them with your own.  I do that sometimes.  Yeah.  Or just say you didn't have it.  I mean, that's the thing.  That's the most disputed charge.  What about the pressure sensitive ones, though?  Oh, I've screwed that up sometimes.  Yeah, there's so many, the minibar system is so fallible that, you know, you put your 
[03:00:30]  sandwich there, you're looking at an item, you get charged, that I spend all morning  removing these charges.  So essentially, if you actually did, you know, have a vodka out of the minibar and then you  say, you know, I never had anything, it's going to get removed.  It's like playing Operation.  You're trying to pull one out from the back there and get it around the other things.  It clinks off of it and you're paying for that, too.  I replace it with fruits and juices because I think that should be more proper.  Oh, boy, Dave.  I got a bag of sand.  I got a bag of sand like Indiana Jones.  Dump it on my tomato juice.  If you're a three-day Coke and whore beans. 
[03:01:00]  Needs an apple.  I take the cookies out and put in celery.  They'll thank you later.  A little note of poem, homily.  What about, let me ask you, what is the best?  The Bibles, get to it.  What do you think is the best hotel in the city?  Like, just an opinion.  I mean, again, you know, I don't stay in as many as I would like.  Well, just from what you know about it.  I don't know, man.  Let's say, I'll just go ahead and throw the Waldorf Astoria, even though I've never been  in the Waldorf. 
[03:01:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Presidential suite at the Waldorf, pretty sweet.  Is it nice?  And sweet, yes.  What's the one I stayed in where I had the art studio downstairs, Kramer Art Studio?  It's like one of those with a butler.  I wish it was the MGM in the 80s.  Is that what you wish?  Can't you stay with a photographer, Frank?  I don't know.  It's New York.  It burnt down and killed a bunch of people.  What about the Bibles?  What about the Bibles?  What about the Bibles?  Are they written with bed bugs and also hate? 
[03:02:00]  I mean, honestly, what's going on with them?  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, where are those Bibles made?  Are they made by blind children in North Korea?  Gideon.  Yeah, those are free, actually.  Those are provided when I was in house.  You can take those?  I had to reorder them.  Oh, of course.  They would love for you to take a Bible, man.  What kind of man would steal a Bible?  No, actually, in a hotel Bible, it says, I believe it says, take this.  I believe it says you can take this.  No, it doesn't.  Yeah, the Gideon Society, I've had to order them.  It's a test from God.  They'll send you as many as you want.  He strikes you down.  He smites you.  I personally think they should replace the Bibles with this book on hotels here. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, man.  Shit.  Yep.  I'm like that.  It's so hard.  Yeah, well, it's very interesting because this is a book I really want to read because I'm in the  every week.  Fuck yeah.  And the bed bug thing.  How do you check for bed bugs real quickly?  I know you look on the bed, but is there a fast way to check?  Or where would the hotel check?  If they heard there was bed bugs.  A fine cone through your pubes.  Bend over, spread them.  He's got the light.  The flash light in his mouth.  Yeah.  It's funny you said pubes.  What is it?  1992? 
[03:03:00]  Oh, that's true.  Who has those?  I'm the smooth cock McGillicuddy.  It's my nickname.  It's my fucking screen name on AOL.  Checks in under.  Yeah.  If the hotel, if someone's called down and said, sir, there's bed bugs, where would the  hotel check first?  In the fucking bed, stupid.  No, they wouldn't.  That's not true, Rich.  They go hiding.  Behind the headboard?  Where would they hang out?  What they're going to do is they're going to call an outside company because that's going  to have to, there's professionals that do that until people aren't trained. 
[03:03:30]  But I do know that if you pull the, it is on the bed, and if you pull the sheets up,  you know, the edge of a mattress?  Yes.  With that little lip.  That little crease.  They chill into that little outside lip.  And if you can see them, they're kind of riddled in that little surrounding edge.  They see bugs or redness from like the crushed ones that were bleeding or their own shit.  Have you seen them?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, that's what you're saying.  No, no, I've never seen one.  I can't wait to get home.  I have a question.  If you kill yourself in a hotel, do you still get charged?  Like, will that go on your card?  No, I don't know. 
[03:04:00]  That's how you really check it out.  That's a good goddamn question.  I would, actually, I would still go with yes, man.  I'm still going to, you know, I'm still going to think that.  That is the most heartless thing ever.  You stay, you pay.  It's a heartless business.  That's weird.  It's a heartless business.  Well, is there a guy like that at every hotel?  Well, how many?  Oh, my.  Here he comes again.  You're a big one.  He has to do it, too.  If you call in a minute, if you ask.  Rich has a question. 
[03:04:30]  If you ask for a refrigerator and they go, it's 20 a night, you say, listen, I stay here all the time.  I don't want to have to go across the street to give you a free refrigerator.  I do it all the time.  That's another way to avoid the costly mini bar.  You can get mini fridges sometimes in the room, and you can store your items that way.  And usually there's no cost for that.  And then, again, if you've already created a relationship with the front desk agent  or tipped or even the bellman, you can get a lot of things that would have a minimal charge.  Just we'll take care of it, you know.  Front desk is in charge of your bill.  I can take all that stuff off. 
[03:05:00]  Rich, what's that, I always thought that you did with the coffee?  What was it?  The coffee maker in the hotel or something?  One time I went to a place and I didn't have a coffee.  I was staying at the Atlantis in the Bahamas, and everything was like $1,000.  And I didn't have coffee, so I went and bought instant coffee.  There was no pot.  And I steamed water in my clothes steamer, and I made instant coffee.  Wow.  Prison coffee.  Nice coffee.  Because if you order it, it takes 45 minutes to an hour in the Bahamas, and it's $50. 
[03:05:30]  I don't care what it is or how long it takes.  I wouldn't use a fucking steam iron to make coffee.  That's terrible.  That's terrible, yes.  Rich, treat yourself.  You know the water scale in there built up?  It's filthy.  It's like hard water.  I was in a hotel one time, and there was the fire.  I guess there was a fire in the hotel, because the fire truck showed up.  And I don't know if it was a drill or not, but this was like a terrace.  So I was out there on the terrace smoking, which I know is probably illegal now, but it  was like back then you could do it.  And I was yelling down through the fire, and I was like, so should I get out? 
[03:06:00]  You know, because no one would tell me.  They just had the bells going the whole time.  But I could have jumped down.  It was like one of those cheap on-the-run hotels.  You know, like there's two levels.  Right.  You could have a truck parked in front of your window.  You ever had one of those?  Like the serial killer truck?  I love that.  I like the skankier hotels.  I don't know.  Yeah, I like those too.  I tend to like less fancy places.  No, I like a fucking gentleman's hotel.  He's like a diplomat, this guy.  I like, if it's not the fuck, I want a gentleman's accommodations, please. 
[03:06:30]  I like 24-hour room service.  24-hour room service.  I want good bedding.  I want good soap.  Good conversation.  Anything you need, sir?  In the lobby.  Yeah.  Yes, I like to be welcomed.  He likes to be monocled when he comes in.  I do.  I do enjoy a good hotel bar.  He does love a nice hotel.  I like a good hotel bar, too, for some reason.  A lot of prostitutes in a hotel bar, actually.  Maybe that's it.  They love rolling around in there.  Yeah, huh? 
[03:07:00]  A lot of bed bugs in the hotel bar.  No, no, no.  A lot of prostitutes.  Oh, bingo.  That's like their spot.  That's under the obvious chapter.  That's in bed.  Right.  No!  The floors are where the booze is.  Wow.  In New York, that's mainly Vegas, right?  No, no, no.  Here, we've had to eliminate some from the bar that would come in all the time.  You know, a couple guests got rolled and stuff.  You know, they would put something in their drink, go up to their room.  East European.  Oh, man.  So you do mostly work in New York hotels, huh?  You take me to your room. 
[03:07:30]  We have a good time.  Good time.  I'm very nice, and then you pass out.  You put everything in a safe right the second you go away.  It starts with those little safes.  Yeah, what's up with the safes?  You guys know how to get into those things?  Yeah, those are good.  You should use those.  Absolutely.  For your toothbrushes.  For your toothbrushes.  I'm definitely going to do that, man.  Yeah, those are...  Yeah, there's...  But what if you forgot your password, then...  Security will come up and unlock it.  It's no problem.  That means you guys...  I had to have that happen at the Borgata this past weekend.  Oh.  I was in there, and the fucking safe all of a sudden wouldn't work with my code,  so they had to get the guy up there.  Punch it in.  Yeah. 
[03:08:00]  Are you allowed to say?  I don't want to say.  Show me on your fingers.  Get out of here.  That's nice.  Yes.  Holy fuck.  It was huge.  You made $12?  $12.  Wow.  I couldn't fucking lose.  I wanted to leave at noon on Sunday.  I wound up staying until 11 p.m. on Sunday at the same table.  Didn't fucking get up.  It just kept fucking stacking up, stacking up, kept doing... 
[03:08:30]  I was betting three spots, six grand a spot, and just couldn't lose.  $18,000?  No.  That's an unlucky number, man.  Three sixes.  You know what?  It's not an unlucky number, you biblical idiot.  It's not an hour number.  And it's not unlucky when you're doubling down on them and splitting and shit, too.  Don't make me bet, you mock.  Here's a hotel question.  Come with me.  I have one more question.  Who are the worst travelers of all the countries and... 
[03:09:00]  Great question.  Who are the worst travelers?  Is it Americans or who is it?  Asians?  As far as gratuities, Europeans are...  Shit.  It's not their culture.  You should see the look on a bellman's face when two of us of Italians pull up.  Oh, boy.  It's just like...  Really?  Yeah.  And then rappers.  So as far as gratuities...  Actually, professional sports people, in my personal experience, professional athletes  tend to be incredibly cheap and very rude. 
[03:09:30]  Wow.  You know, they're coming up and they're not even taking their headphones off.  They're like, I need a new key.  I need a new key.  I'm like, you know...  They're jerk-offs.  They're absolutely jerk-offs.  They're the same jocks that they were in school.  Yeah.  Assholes.  I don't usually tip the bellman a lot of times, but I do my own luggage.  Like, when I'm in a hotel, they don't do anything for me.  I don't like my shit.  Why don't you fucking go to the kitchen in a restaurant and bring out your own food  and cut off the tip to the waitress?  Yeah.  I've done that.  Oh, sorry.  I've done that.  I've walked right in and cooked.  Didn't you see Top Chef, the Herpes episode? 
[03:10:00]  No, but there's got to be, like, one group where you're like, oh, my God, I cannot believe,  like, you know, these people are here.  Well, I mean, even business travelers, like, when you just break it down to that, people  who travel for business and they're in hotels all the time, those people, when they don't  get what they want, or just the affluent black cards, black cards, oh, my God, those people  scare me, man.  Is that what you call them?  You call them what you want.  Yeah, I mean, that's a funny black guy. 
[03:10:30]  Wow.  All right, let's get them out of here.  Jacob.  Oh, God.  This book looks terrific.  We're all done.  We're all done.  Yeah, look at that.  That looks cool, dude.  Yeah, we're going to start our Thanksgiving, man.  Heads in beds.  Jacob Tomsky.  It really does.  And plug his book signings, too.  If you are, oh, actually, in New Orleans.  We have people in New Orleans.  That's cool.  5.30 p.m. on the 28th, which is at the Garden District Bookshop.  And the 29th, only 7 to 7.45, Malaprops Bookstore in Asheville, North Carolina. 
[03:11:00]  So 20th, 29th, Jacob will be down south.  Jacob Tomsky on Twitter.  You can follow him there.  But this book looks really great, man.  I wish I had it earlier.  I wish I read.  I didn't read it.  Yeah, there's no pictures either.  You would have nothing to do with it.  You'd wind up eating it like a fucking gerbil.  Rich, where are you going to be?  This weekend, I'll be at Gotham this week.  And next weekend, at JJ's Comedy in Jersey somewhere.  Where we did that pilot.  You know what I'm talking about?  David, tell, you got a lot going on. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, I got the DC Improv coming up on the 29th.  No tolerance today for him.  For who, me?  Why did I end up here?  I know, right?  It might not even be you.  I'm ready for a few days.  It might not even be you.  I just have no tolerance for you today.  Yes, Dave.  Dave's Old Porn dot com.  And you can follow it at Old Porn.  And this week, Amy Schumer and the guy who bangs Debbie and Debbie Does Dallas holiday special.  Happy Thanksgiving.  That sounds great.  11 o'clock showtime. 
[03:12:00]  Yes.  And I have...  Rich had a great appearance.  It might be me.  I'm ready for a few days.  That's all.  All of us getting together again.  I have New Year's Eve.  I will be in Buffalo.  And Kenny, am I missing any gigs?  Or is that it right now?  That's it.  New Year's Eve week, Buffalo.  Yeah.  And I have a new CD coming out called No Baby For You.  And it comes out on the 11th of December.  It's an old set.  I taped it in 2007.  Some of the material is from Monster Rain. 
[03:12:30]  But it's a great set, so I'm releasing it.  I just don't want anybody complaining.  Very nice.  I want to bring up Sunday, December 23rd.  I know it's a while away, but just keep your plans there.  89 North Music Venue.  It's called 89 North Music Venue.  89 North Ocean Avenue.  It's me, Joe, Rotgut, fucking Almost a Journey, and U2.  Going to be playing there all night that night.  That sounds like a cool show.  It's a great show.  It's going to be fun.  This weekend I'm at Gotham, and we have a podcast, My Wife Hates Me.  This week was a very good one. 
[03:13:00]  They're all good.  This week was good.  Why were you away?  I like the podcast.  Huh?  And next week, J&J Comedy.  All right.  Thank you very much, Jacob.  And, of course, David Tell and Rich Voss.  My God, what a show.  Thanks for having us, guys.  Thank you for having us.  Thank you so much.  First time, long time.  Enjoy your Thanksgiving.  Yeah.  We'll see you Monday.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  Next live show Monday.  But we got a big, what, best of special?  Yeah.  What is it?  Chip is hosting it.  Chip's hosting it. 
[03:13:30]  All right, boy.  For two days.  Nice.  Oh, boy.  Chip is hosting it.  What kind of bits?  The best of the comics, right?  Comics, yeah.  So all the funny people we've had on in the last year or so.  Good.  Very good.  Their best bits.  Or some of their best bits.  David Tell might have made it.  You think he made it, Dave?  I don't know.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  I feel like I dropped the ball this whole time here.  Oh, my God.  You had very poignant questions.  No, but I...  Had some very funny slams on that cover.  That's great.  And when you talked about smoking on the balcony, it was riveting.  It was good, right? 
[03:14:00]  I think it was excellent.  What an asshole.  But how could...  You know, I couldn't hit a home run off of that setup of this Arab-Israeli thing.  You know?  Wow.  You gave me slow balls.  I couldn't even...  That set the table for the rest of the appearance, huh?  But I think that's going to be a great way to celebrate the holidays.  Listen to some of the best jams or, you know...  I'm sure there's going to be some rank-outs and a couple of...  Well, there's going to be...  It's segments... 
[03:14:30]  Oh, my God, no.  Ah.  All right.  Are you shitting?  You play with him.  Tape.  We don't have fun with this, Dave.  We know this.  No, I won't be.  During the year.  All right.  See you guys Monday.  Happy Thanksgiving.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is available later today with SiriusXM On Demand.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.
