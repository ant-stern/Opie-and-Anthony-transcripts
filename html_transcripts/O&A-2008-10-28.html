<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with typical playful banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, quickly shifting to a discussion of a Jack Tober/John Lander show in Boston, described as featuring "dual hole" acts.  They briefly touched upon the World Series and a technical problem with Norton's headphones before diving into a serious discussion about the death of Jennifer Hudson's nephew, sparking emotional reactions and debates on gun control and the death penalty.  A caller, Kevin from Illinois, offered insight into former Governor George Ryan's incarceration.  The tragic accidental death of an eight-year-old boy who shot himself with an Uzi at a shooting range further fueled this conversation about gun safety and parental responsibility.

The show then transitioned to "Jocktober," a segment satirizing poorly produced radio shows.  They dissected a ludicrous $5,000 giveaway commercial from "Steve and Pruitt" (John Lander), focusing on its absurdity, particularly the mention of the boss being on vacation.  This led to a broader critique of bad radio commercials, followed by audio clips and discussions of "Nancy and Chris" from a Tampa Bay station, including their Free Credit Report parody song, a story about a woman exposing herself to teens, a Rob Schneider interview, and the arrest of the Naked Cowboy.  The segment concluded with humorous speculation about "manty hose," a purported Australian men's pantyhose fashion trend.

Further "Jocktober" content followed, including discussions about "manks" (men's Spanx) and Eric's "unbelievable" and "unbearable" commercials for the show.  The hosts planned to perform "candle wax shots," referencing a similar incident with East Side Dave. A 13-year-old caller, JC from Jersey, provided humorous commentary on spanks, promising to check his mother's drawers.  They revisited a previous "Tubes Day" segment, and engaged in a bit with "Big A," a large man, reenacting scenarios such as a bank robbery.  Anthony's choking on watermelon provided a comedic interruption.  The hosts promoted their "pole dancing for the stars" competition sponsored by Kevin Smith's "Zack and Miri Make a Porno," noting its low registration.  A crudely written theme song, containing an offensive lyric about Anthony's views on Jewish people, was played, sparking listener feedback and more jokes.  The show also covered the aggressive behavior of Philadelphia Phillies fans towards Tampa Bay Rays fans during the World Series, with numerous callers sharing similar experiences.  The departure of an employee, Roland, was also humorously discussed.

Another segment started with a story about a missing dog, Choochee, before shifting to a news story about a Chinese restaurant in Hamburg, New York, where health inspectors found employees butchering a deer in the kitchen.  The hosts speculated about the deer meat's use in dishes.  The fictional "Big A" character reappeared, dramatically interrupting executions.  The "FU Line" segment featured angry caller voicemails.  A listener claimed to be a fan of the restaurant.  Guest E-Rock was dared to participate in candle wax shots, resulting in a prolonged comedic bit.  The show then covered an ESPN reporter's on-air curse word and the attempted assassination plot against Barack Obama by two men in tuxedos and top hats who planned to kill 88 black people and Obama.  The hosts discussed security risks and shared personal anecdotes about encounters with presidential security.  This segued into discussions about Sarah Palin's vice-presidential candidacy and nostalgic recollections of 1970s softcore pornography, mentioning *Fairy Tales* and *Cheerleaders*.

A caller, Scott from Texas, recounted an awkward experience witnessing his friend and girlfriend having sex near him while he played EverQuest, leading to crude sexual banter.  The disastrous attempt to interview Ric Flair followed, revealing significant disorganization and miscommunication within the show's staff, particularly criticizing Steve.  Flair eventually called in, but the interview was plagued by technical difficulties.  He discussed his WWE retirement, an autograph signing, a reality show, and his relationships with Vince McMahon and Bret Hart.  A brief conversation with Anthony's friend, Sal, occurred.  The final segment featured extended audio of a John McCain campaign speech with the hosts' crude commentary, including jokes about McCain, Cindy McCain, and Barack Obama.  The show continued its sexually explicit and offensive banter, featuring E-Rock's impressions and discussions of franchising possibilities and future broadcasts.  The showâ€™s reaction to a John McCain campaign speech continued, filled with crude jokes, mockery of McCain, Cindy McCain, and Obama, a "line of the day" segment with vulgar punchlines, and E-Rock's flatulence.  Mention was made of a future "face shots" segment and a book release by Jimmy.  The overall tone remained irreverent and highly offensive.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  How are you?  Well, I'm talking to the listeners, Opie.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's what we do.  We go, how are you?  And I don't expect an answer back.  They told us not to talk to them until 6.15.  Oh.  They're still waking up. 
[00:00:30]  Righty-o.  Don't ask that question.  They're getting the sleepies out of their eyes.  I just want to go.  Like an alarm clock.  We should do that every morning.  People just reach for something.  Try to hit the snooze.  I like that.  That would be annoying.  I like that idea.  If I was asleep and heard that.  Because when you wake up to the radio, it kind of just fades in nice.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  And probably a lot of people set the alarm for our show.  Sure.  And now we give them this.  Meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.  We stopped at the same time.  That's creepy.  Yeah, that's weird.  We knew.  See, we haven't lost it.  We knew.  Our chemistry is still just like it was the first day we broadcast it together.  Oh, that's right, Opie.  Woo.  Oh, you missed a good one yesterday, Jimmy.  Jack Tober featuring John Lander up in Boston.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:01:30]  He had all the features.  All the features.  It was, I think, dual hole.  Dual hole.  Yeah.  He was sporting.  He was dual wielding the holes.  Oh, no.  I hope we do another one today.  Because we only have, what, three days left in this?  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and maybe Friday as well.  Monday, Wednesday, Sunday, Sunday.  Four days.  And I'm very happy because I could finally watch a World Series game.  Oh.  Well, they did stop it after six.  After six innings, it's tied at two. 
[00:02:00]  So I could do a three-inning game before I go to bed.  Sure.  When's the game going to start?  Like 8 o'clock tonight if they don't get rain in Philly?  Yeah.  And Wednesday or Thursday, and they pick up the game right where it was, right?  Yep.  All right.  Very good.  And I'm not going to acknowledge that the Rangers beat the Islanders, so don't even call  about that.  Oh, that's better.  Okay.  What happened?  I don't know.  For some reason, my headphone balance was all the way over to the right.  Oh, really?  I just...  Let's not complain.  I think they might have fixed everything. 
[00:02:30]  No complaining.  But it's just like I looked over and realized, like, oh, someone had just turned it all the  way to the right.  I guess they didn't want to hear anything in their left ear.  Remember Chris Olivero?  He used to be an intern, and now I think he runs, like, the radio division.  I remember the name.  Yeah.  He...  I wrote him yesterday.  I'm like, yeah, today's problem is that the phones didn't work.  Yeah.  And I go, well, that made our jobs very hard today.  Just want to let you know.  So he writes back, this is how they deal with stuff in corporate.  Yeah, but all the other stuff that was wrong, that's fixed now, right? 
[00:03:00]  Oh, okay.  I just wrote back, whatever.  You know.  You can't justify by saying, well...  At least.  At least the other things are now fixed.  Yeah.  That doesn't work in our world.  Give that kid lemons.  And by the way, they didn't fix the door, so don't go in there, Jimmy.  You'll be locked in there.  I was locked in the bathroom for, like, five minutes yesterday.  What a treat.  And no one cared, and no one noticed, which is nice, so...  We just kept doing the show.  Yeah, that made me feel good.  Well, I was wondering what Nosferatu did with his coat after they killed him. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, Kenny.  Looking good.  Nosferatu.  Kenny's got the biggest coat ever.  It really is.  What the hell?  Big lumbering dumbbell coat.  No one else could get their clothes dry clean, because Kenny's coat is in for a washing.  It is.  It's a tarpaulin.  So we get to see the World Series, I guess, tonight.  Sixth inning tied at two.  And these Titans, they're the only undefeated team in the NFL this year? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  7-0, right?  Yep.  Beat the Colts.  Beat the Colts.  That's very Titan-ly.  All right.  God, I'm a little depressed.  I hate when I see kids that are dead.  I didn't see a dead kid, but...  Stay out of my house.  Jennifer Hudson's nephew found dead in that SUV.  Yeah.  A bullet to his head.  What a effin' savage.  Oh, you didn't know, Jimmy?  I knew he was found dead, but I'm actually... 
[00:04:30]  It's the bread department.  I'm actually just reading the beginning.  I didn't really know.  Oh, yeah.  The guy made it easy for the kid.  You know.  Let's shoot the kid.  Let's shoot a seven-year-old.  That's a tough one, right?  Jesus.  That's probably the guy, the brother-in-law, right?  Well, they're not saying.  Oh, come on.  I know.  They're not saying.  Everyone knows who it was.  Just disgusting, though.  It's on the front page of all the papers today.  And it's just downright depressing.  Leave the kid alone.  Nah.  You're having a domestic spat.  Leave the kid out of it.  Let the kid live. 
[00:05:00]  Move to New York.  He's got an aunt that's doing very well.  You're thinking in terms of people that actually think.  Oh, I know, man.  And this guy.  I know.  This guy's just an animal.  And I don't know what the hell's wrong with the...  I'm not placing any blame on anybody else in this except for the perp.  But for God's sake, she had told them, look, I make a nice living.  I'm an Oscar winner. 
[00:05:30]  Move out of that area.  Where they said, you know, people heard gunfire, but it's not uncommon at night to hear, you know, thugs just shooting at each other.  Well, that's what CBS says now.  It's not uncommon to have your equipment break down.  Yeah.  So then you just accept it because it's not uncommon.  It's acceptable.  Sorry, I go.  So they just, you know, they stay there.  And here she is making a nice buck.  Like I said, Oscar winner.  And they wouldn't leave.  I was wondering about that because I was like, why would you stay in such a horrible neighborhood? 
[00:06:00]  If someone in your family is doing well.  I heard somebody being interviewed and they said, you know, the mother never wanted to leave because she had grown up in this area.  It's like, pick your ass up and leave.  Get a U-Haul immediately.  Just leave everything there.  Screw it.  You hit the lottery.  You got a kid that's doing very well.  Get the F out.  Right.  You think if my mom's was living in some place that was nasty, I would still have her live in there?  Yes.  Hells no.  Oh, I mean, no.  Oh, no.  But this guy, though, this guy was family. 
[00:06:30]  If he's the guy that...  Oh, he was.  But he was also just a wonderful human being.  He was in prison at some point.  For a car jacking or something?  Got him out of prison.  No, on attempted murder.  The guy's no good.  It's just the...  And here we go with the death penalty.  And this is where we don't take phone calls because I don't want to hear the other side.  Yeah.  Kill these people.  Yeah.  Kill all of them.  Illinois, do they have the death penalty?  They don't, right?  What are you kidding?  What are you kidding?  They don't have the death penalty.  Death penalty?  You can't own a gun, but still, like Anthony says, the savages get their guns anyway. 
[00:07:00]  He got one?  Wow.  I wonder how that happened.  It's illegal to own a gun like that.  How is he able to get one?  See, following your logic, if you allow everyone to have guns, then at least a seven-year-old would have been armed and he would have had a fair fight.  Hey, right.  Just don't give a gun to an eight-year-old.  Apparently, they can't handle it either.  Oh, we'll get into that.  We'll stick into that in a second.  Yikes.  But death penalty, come on.  Just kill these people.  Who's got morals?  No one has morals when it gets right down to it. 
[00:07:30]  Highest murder rate and the strictest gun control laws.  And it's because you get a guy like this, he'll get a gun.  He'll get one.  But, you know, the average Joe, they just got to take it.  They got to take it.  They got to walk around just wondering when their time is going to be up.  I'm tired of it.  I guarantee you, he went in.  If he didn't want to do it, I think it was like he probably, they said the brother got shot when he walked in.  Yeah.  And then he probably went and shot the mother. 
[00:08:00]  And the kid was probably just a witness.  Yeah.  Whoever it was just didn't want the, was a complete.  Like they're not going to know who it was, too.  Like what do they think?  What do people think when they shoot a witness like that?  Like, all right, all loose ends tied up.  Yep.  Go home.  Go like this.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Good enough.  The problem of my life.  What do the governor of that fine state do there, Stump Rang?  Stump Rang's got some knowledge on the death penalty up there.  In the year 2000, he suspended the death penalty and said we need to look into this.  Because apparently, in all cases, there seem to be questions about some of the convictions. 
[00:08:30]  But he just said, nope, we're going to stop doing this.  So Illinois pulled the plug in 2000.  And they've been just bantering back and forth on it.  But, you know, New York has the death penalty, but has it ever been used?  No.  No.  No.  Oh, don't even ask us.  We know.  Yeah.  We knew that was a joke when they reinstated the death penalty in New York State.  We're like, okay, this gets some people voting and getting some people happy, but it's never  going to be used.  That's the new thing they do.  They have the death penalty.  They just don't use it.  You don't have any people there that are willing to use it. 
[00:09:00]  So screw it.  They should make a law.  If you have the death penalty in your state, you have to use it at least once a year.  I like that.  How great would that be, though?  Just on whoever's got the worst crime.  Right.  Like, so only like a traffic ticket, a speeding.  Imagine.  Yeah.  Everyone behaves, and it comes down to like, yeah, loitering or littering or jaywalking.  It's like, sorry, you were worse.  It's on the books, you know?  It works.  Got to kill one a year.  It's kind of one of those little things we hope never happened, but you're it. 
[00:09:30]  Wouldn't that be a great rule, though?  Oh, fantastic.  You know what?  Maybe we make it a national holiday.  Oh, really?  All the states, on a certain day, they have to kill one person.  Sorry.  Yeah.  It's the rules.  Boy, wouldn't you be good, though?  Yeah, you would.  I would think so.  You know, though, it costs more money to kill somebody than it does such a good person.  Who cares? 
[00:10:00]  At least the family sleeps at night.  The appeals process.  You know, dude, it's all about the money, and you know.  Apparently they nailed some guy in Texas after a real short time.  I think he was convicted in 2003, and they put him to death, which is, you know, a relatively  short period of time, and most people are going for 20 years.  Yes, Mr. Brown?  Yeah, Texas is overachieving.  Yeah, they are, correct?  I think they're not like the old days.  No.  No. 
[00:10:30]  But I think they're leading the country.  Oh, yeah.  They've always been way up there, as far as that goes.  But the guy even said, he goes, look, I'm not ready to die, and he said, I'm not ready  to die, and most people get like 20 years on death row.  It's like, what's this?  Yeah, see, a lot of these criminals know that, too.  They know all this stuff.  But they did not.  They're like, ah, death penalty is a joke.  I'll be in prison at least for a decade or two.  But it was one of these things that were so blatant, like they had everything on this 
[00:11:00]  guy, that it was absolutely him.  Yeah.  There's no ifs, ands, or buts.  And, yeah, give him the old blue liquid.  Let's say hi to Kevin in Illinois.  He has a little more info on the governor.  Kevin.  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good, Kevin.  Good.  The governor of Illinois put a moratorium on the death penalty here, and then while  he was governor, and then a few years later, he was convicted for defrauding the states 
[00:11:30]  through the license for bribes for when he was Secretary of State.  So he's not doing time.  What, the governor's doing time?  Yeah, the former governor, George Ryan.  He's in prison in Wisconsin.  You know, I think what we should do is just round up every politician, because they're  guilty of something.  Is there a politician out there that doesn't have something going on on the side that's  going to be caught?  Yeah, there does seem to be a lot of crooked politicians. 
[00:12:00]  Because some Alaskan politician, he was found guilty of taking money and redoing his  house and all that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So, yeah, Jennifer Hudson's seven-year-old nephew found out.  That was just awful TV yesterday to watch, as the SUV's just sitting there on the side,  you know, on a side street with the helicopter view, and the authorities or the cops or whatever  are kind of around it, but they're not ready to open the door.  Ugh, what a horrible job. 
[00:12:30]  I guess they go over the whole thing first, so they don't ring anything.  Right.  And then get inside.  And then they finally open the door, and one guy opened the door, and the rest kind  of, we're standing back, ugh.  It's got to be unpleasant.  What do we know about the Uzi?  Oh, that story.  I think this is in Westfield.  Yeah, Connecticut?  I believe it's in Westfield, up there in the New England area.  I never knew there was a place you could go to to fire automatic, full automatic weapons 
[00:13:00]  up there, but apparently someone decided that their eight-year-old son was, you know, capable  of handling an Uzi, which has to be one of the most raucous weapons to shoot.  This thing is, it'll go off in a wacky direction when you shoot it.  The recoil on it is sick.  It spins the front up at you if you're not careful.  It's definitely just made for short little bursts, and you've got to keep the barrel 
[00:13:30]  of that thing down.  It'll go up right at you.  And apparently that's what happened.  This kid had the Uzi in his hand.  His father was getting a camera ready or something.  The father was ready, yeah.  There's supposed to be an instructor with the kid to hold the Uzi down.  Right.  But, you know, the kid prematurely pulls the trigger there, gets a little excited, pulls  the trigger, the thing spins backward and hits him right under the jaw, and kills him. 
[00:14:00]  It sounds like Dad was trying to make a YouTube video because there was an Uzi, there was a  pumpkin, and it's close to Halloween.  There's plenty of videos like that.  Thinking, I got a nice YouTube video here.  All right, go, son.  That is a really stupid thing to do.  Give your kid a friggin' Uzi like that, a loaded Uzi, and leave him for a split second  to be unsupervised like that?  Just to give it to him is crazy.  You ask me, no eight-year-old should be firing an automatic weapon, you know? 
[00:14:30]  And then to have him like that unattended for a split second, doesn't matter.  It's all it takes.  Yeah.  You fire an Uzi.  Try firing an Uzi one day, a full automatic one.  You'll be like, how the hell would anyone give this to a kid?  It wants to kill you.  The gun wants to kill you.  It does.  It's the sickest thing to shoot.  You've shot one?  Yeah.  They're insane.  So what do you do?  You've got to really hold it down.  It seems like a very light weapon, too, right? 
[00:15:00]  A little short.  Yeah.  It's what amounts to a machine pistol.  Right.  It's bigger than something else, like a Tech-9 or something, a machine pistol.  But they're very small, pretty light, and have a hell of a recoil that just flips the barrel up.  So you've got to hold it down.  Yeah.  And again, short burst.  It wants to go off to the left also.  Why to the left?  It's just the way the thing's made, the way the recoil is. 
[00:15:30]  Mine wants to go to the left, too.  Yeah, a little to the left?  Yeah.  Your Uzi?  Just a little bit.  Do you have an Uzi?  Just a little to the left.  Just has this desire to go to the left.  I'd rather have something in the way of maybe a shotgun down there.  Yours goes all the way to the right.  I mean all the way.  Yeah, that was like a pretty...  That was Massachusetts, by the way.  Westfield, Massachusetts.  Was it?  Yeah, thank you, Struff.  How can you shoot full automatic weapons in Massachusetts?  It was a gun show or something. 
[00:16:00]  Was it?  Don't they get some permits for that?  I guess so.  I don't know anything about full automatic weapons or shooting them anyway.  Yeah.  Because I know you really can't do it.  It's not something civilians really are privy to, except at these shows every so often.  Right.  You see it on YouTube, though.  They show them a lot.  Kids firing.  It's kind of a cute thing to watch some little four-year-old firing full automatic weapons.  It's just insanity.  That's got to be horrific to watch your own son kill himself by accident right in front 
[00:16:30]  of your eyes.  Got to be.  All right.  We got all the sad kid stuff out of the way.  Now we go for the lofts after the break.  All the fun kid stuff, right?  Yeah.  We'll go to the fun kid stuff next.  Uncle Paul.  Yes.  877-212-018.  I do believe the phones are working, right?  Oh, yeah.  We took a couple already.  Duh.  All right.  Good.  Good to know.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony, good morning to everybody.  How's everyone doing this morning? 
[00:17:00]  Pretty good.  Sucks here in New York.  I believe Philly's getting the rain too, right?  I don't think we're going to have a World Series tonight.  I think that game is going to be played tomorrow.  And then we watch the Phillies win the World Series for the first time in a long time.  You want to watch the World Series, do you?  I've never been to a baseball game.  That'd be good therapy too.  The drive-in was a treat.  Yeah.  Because people, because it's pouring rain.  Horrible. 
[00:17:30]  Downpour.  And people just, I don't know.  Is it dangerous?  Driving like, I'm not driving like I usually do when the roads dry, but over 35 miles an  hour on the highway perhaps?  No.  Then there was a school bus in the left lane matching the speed with a truck.  And I'm just going, I'm sitting there going, wait.  There's no kids on the school bus yet.  I don't know.  It was dark.  I couldn't see.  No, that's the school bus driver. 
[00:18:00]  He was out way too late last night.  Yeah.  And he has to get to the, you know, to the school or the depot or wherever the hell you  start picking up kids.  Hungover.  Oh.  So they make me do the right lane sweep when it's raining.  Yeah.  That's not dangerous.  That's not safe for everybody else on the road.  Oh.  Safe for you.  Get out of my way.  What's up, Boston?  What's up, Rochester?  How's Rochester today?  I heard they didn't play our show yesterday.  Maybe Steve can find out why. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Somebody asked me, are you guys off in Rochester?  I'm like, I don't think so.  We got fans up there, man.  Don't mess with the show, please.  It's working.  877-212-01A.  Well, we have a couple things.  I think we hit this audience right here that's listening with some jocktober.  Jacktober.  We love it.  We're almost at the end of our jocktober bit.  Well, everybody does their rocktober.  Yeah.  Which, you know, we like doing jocktober, featuring shows from around the country that 
[00:19:00]  suck, that have the typical, either the puker guy with his, oh, God, no, stop now, guys,  with the whole, the bad bits.  God, what a classic one we had yesterday.  Which one?  I don't even know.  Just all the bad, just the whole thing was just all, there was bad bits.  There was a phrase that pays or the phrase of the day.  Jimmy, we were listening to a show yesterday.  I already forgot the name and everything, because that's, thank you, Stump Brain, but I didn't  need to know it was John Lander. 
[00:19:30]  Who gives a crap?  It was, and the guy, we went to a commercial that they had back in the 90s, where it's  like, hey, the boss is on vacation, and we're going to be giving away $5,000, like the  boss is away, and we stole this money.  You know, all hell breaks loose when the boss is around.  But it doesn't.  He's like insinuating, yeah, that since the boss is away, they took this money, and they're  going to give it away.  And like, instead of just taking it for themselves, because it's theft, if you're stealing it,  or giving it away right then and there to just somebody, you had to wait and call Thursday, 
[00:20:00]  and then for some reason, there's just a monkey in there, too.  Because why not?  Because back then it was so goofy to just have some kind of wacky monkey.  Who's show is that?  That was the guy.  That's this guy?  Yeah.  That was the guy from yesterday.  Can I hear that?  Yeah, we're getting the audio.  If we could get the audio just for the commercial, it is so bad.  She's cute, too.  With a monkey?  Oh, no, the gallant.  Oh, the girl.  Okay.  I thought you meant the monkey. 
[00:20:30]  It was the boss.  Monkeys are just the devil.  You know, if we did the boss bit, we haven't had a boss since Tom Chiasana left, and that's  got to be eight months ago at this point, we would have given away, God, a half million  dollars.  Of course.  It's so bad.  This is one of those bad radio commercials where, look, if the boss went away and he  took five grand, he'd get in trouble.  He wouldn't have a contest that then goes till Thursday or something.  Hey, E-Rock, know what we got to do here?  We got to get all the bad radio commercials. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Could you do that, E-Rock?  That's a good idea.  Get horrible radio commercials.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's...  But my question is this.  Wouldn't the boss see the commercial?  Wouldn't they have to film it and then put it on the air?  Who paid for that?  Wouldn't somebody get wind of it and go, look, it's alleged that you're going on vacation  and this man is saying on the radio that he's going to steal money and give it away.  Do you have a comment?  And the boss would say he can't take that.  That's corporate money.  Right.  How do you make a commercial?  And the boss goes away.  Yes.  And still doesn't know that you've taken the money. 
[00:21:30]  You've stolen the money.  What are the consequences when the boss returns?  Oh, God.  Okay.  That looks pretty bad.  Who is it?  Mullin it?  That's a horrendous show called Steve and Pruitt.  They're playing the name game.  Steve and Pruitt.  Pruitt or whatever they...  Steve and Pruitt.  Whatever.  They stink too.  He's got one of those...  Was that from Laverne and Shirley?  What's his name?  The Big Ragu haircut.  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.  You know, we're going to take this in another direction.  Radio show commercials. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  We've filmed a few over the years.  Of course we have.  They're all right.  You know.  They're not over-the-top hacky like we're looking at right now.  No.  All right.  Here's the commercial from yesterday, Jimmy.  Okay.  93Q's morning zookeeper, John Lander.  With the boss on vacation, we thought we'd give away another five grand this Thursday  morning.  How is it cake?  Steve, because he's away, Jimmy.  With the boss on vacation, we thought we'd give away.  We, we, we.  Like, hey, we didn't get permission for this one.  He's a zookeeper.  The morning zookeeper.  You think it's like when your parents left and you, you threw a keg party, like the boss 
[00:22:30]  is like, now I'm going to be on vacation.  Don't you do anything crazy.  Don't give away money.  Whatever you do.  And then he's like, hey, the boss on vacation.  Like, like the boss wouldn't call corporate and go, they stole money and they gave it away.  Do you have proof?  They did a commercial.  We'll get that to us.  We'll retrieve that.  Those, we'll retrieve those monies.  Those monies.  I just, I, I wish we heard the show when the boss came back where they had some explaining 
[00:23:00]  to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  He comes back tomorrow.  You think we're in trouble?  I don't know.  The boss like is in his office, going through his office and going, there's $5,000 missing.  Yeah.  The morning show's avoiding the boss.  If he gave that away, why?  Not our GM or the PD is on vacation.  The boss.  Yeah.  The boss.  The boss.  Because, you know, everyone hates their boss.  Yeah.  Everyone relates to the boss, wants to take stuff from the boss, man.  Take his job and shove it, boss.  Yeah.  They teach you that in radio school. 
[00:23:30]  The listeners just go, this guy's so cool.  The boss is on vacation.  What does he do?  He takes five grand and gives it away.  He's the coolest.  I got to listen to him.  Yeah.  He doesn't listen to his boss, either.  He doesn't take any guff.  Yeah.  The boss is on vacation, so I'm going to make this video with my coworker and a German shepherd  with oven mitts.  That would be believable.  Mm-hmm.  I thought we'd give away another five grand this Thursday morning.  Ow, piece of cake.  Put your radio on 93Q.  That's 92.9 FM.  Listen to 710 Thursday morning. 
[00:24:00]  710.  I announce the birthday in this envelope.  If it matches yours, you could win five grand.  It's so easy a monkey could do it.  93Q.  It's so easy a monkey could do it.  More money and more music.  Somebody's going to win $5,000 Thursday morning at 710 on 93Q.  It could be you.  It seems a little...  It doesn't give the boss time to, like, find out.  It seems a little too organized for...  Yeah, your birthday is in an envelope, and if you call and it's your birthday, you win it.  They got the exact time they're doing it.  Yeah.  Boy, way to throw the boss off. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, it's really a lot of evidence.  The boss can't figure this one out.  There's a commercial they had to film ahead of time.  Where's the boss going to have a lobotomy?  How's he not going to figure this out?  Unless the boss is going to Thailand to date young boys.  So when he comes back, you have something to hold over his head.  You want to take me to court, sir?  Unless your boss is going out for ice cream for four to six hours.  Bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep.  Could we please just hear the beginning again, just when he says, when the boss is on vacation?  The boss.  Please, can I hear that?  What do you want?  Just the beginning of that again. 
[00:25:00]  Just the beginning with the boss on vacation.  The boss is on vacation.  It's an unnecessary thing for the commercial.  It really is.  How about, for no reason, we're giving away money on Thursday?  You know what?  I can't wait.  I see all the YouTube radio commercials, and I think we're going to have some great ones  in the next half hour.  Danny's playing a lot again.  Look at this old broad smashing a radio.  It's like Quint smashing the radio again on Mr. T.  Oh, a karate chop on the radio. 
[00:25:30]  Two fat guys running into each other.  And is it because it's so outrageous that your radio blows up?  We're going to find out, Anthony.  All right, here's the boss thing.  93 Q's morning zookeeper, John Lander.  With the boss on vacation, we thought we'd give away another five minutes.  It's so unnecessary.  With the boss on vacation.  I'm out.  Why does the boss have to be on vacation?  How about, you know, we want to give you guys a chance to win $5,000.  Yeah.  That's more believable.  No.  The boss has nothing to do with this.  He's a rebel.  He's crazy. 
[00:26:00]  With the boss right there helping to direct this commercial, no one would think less of  it.  They would just think, all right, five grand.  No one thinks, where's the boss when you're giving away money?  We always assume you're allowed to.  Oh.  The boss knows about this?  Click.  Turning the radio off.  I don't care about your money.  Well, listen.  Oh, no.  That's Scott.  Scott and Ross.  Not Todd.  This was Ross Britton.  They're zoomed in on their upper half, which is in a tuxedo. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  And then they pull out with the camera, and apparently they're in a tutu.  Yeah, because that's funny.  Scott's in a tutu.  Because that's funny.  And the other gentleman.  Yeah.  And they're wearing flippers.  Because that's funny.  Wow.  How random.  Yeah.  That's really funny.  Scott and Ross, 84.  All right.  Oh, we're serious.  They couldn't be serious, Justin.  Oh, I get it now.  All right.  E-Rock's going to have a few of these commercials in a few minutes.  But let's get into today's Jocktober.  Business sucks a fat one.  Oh, my God.

There was no joy attached to that sound.  No.  today for jocktober we uh feature a show out of tampa bay wow the picture just uh 
[00:28:00]  now says it all now sam i'm looking at i'm a little confused because we did a mix station  yesterday how could there be another mix station in america well yesterday's mix station was all  the best mix of boston today's mix station is all the best mix of tampa bay oh you think they  have a different mix you got to mix different elements in depending on the city to get the  very best mix hence mix mix yeah she's very uh nancy and chris and uh she looks like she has like a 
[00:28:30]  mouth like goldie hawn she's kind of a cute mouth a little bit yeah she has hair like bobby from taxi  and uh their their little nancy and chris logo almost looks like um the brady brady font  yeah uh let's not forget they also have frodo and juno yeah who do they what do they do i'm excited  now those guys are like sidekicks juno's a girl and frodo is a guy but sounds like a girl frodo  frodo he's a guy that sounds like a girl yeah as in oh yeah wow they also have one of the great 
[00:29:00]  features on their website uh which uh is hunk of the day oh hey who's uh today's hunk of the day  it's just kind of shirtless guys so it was pretty you know at least it's something to look at while  the holes got together and just went you know there's always girls on websites we should have  the hunk of the day hunk okay oh look at this hunk he has nice buns shut up can we do can we do 
[00:29:30]  retard of the day mongoloid of the day please let's do it we start we'll start with erock just to keep  it fair could we please do that even if it's on some obscure fan site somewhere wherever start it  maybe it's on anthony's new site maybe a little you know all right well it's nancy and chris on  mix 100.7 in tampa bay florida with frodo and juno yeah yeah yeah what else can you tell us 
[00:30:00]  about the show now this nancy and chris are they making believe they're a married couple on the  air are they really married no my gut is that judging by the picture and the material on the  show chris is probably not married oh but um no nancy's kind of the edgy funny one is she really  group yeah you think chris is permitted to be married or not in certain states not in all states  necessarily oh well we're gonna start retard of the day it'll be on a website soon uh the nancy 
[00:30:30]  and chris song what's this about there sam well you know that free credit report commercial where  they're singing and do do do do what they did is they parodied it and made made it kind of the lyrics  associated with their show it's you're talking about the commercial with those downtrodden young  uh gentlemen that are playing and they're always in some crappy job yeah um where they're talking  about how they don't have good credit yet they're walking around uh areas with people that really 
[00:31:00]  shouldn't have good credit but they switch things around uh for politically correct reasons i hate  that effing commercial by the way just for that reason too why because it's uh it's just a bunch of  young white guys uh complaining about how their credit is lousy and they're walking around certain  um company let's say especially in this latest commercial um where people uh are typically known  to probably have worse credit but they're the ones with bad credit complaining about how they have 
[00:31:30]  to take this lousy job because they have bad credit there's a lot of those commercials around i  complained about one a while ago yeah with a bank a certain bank called wamu i remember that  they got into grave trouble for lending to people that probably shouldn't be lent to  and what it was was uh it was an african-american gentleman leading around a bunch of old bankers  and ordering them around and uh the bankers all they cared about was money ho ho ho ho and he was  just telling people come on in we'll lend you money yeah hey good luck to you wamu 
[00:32:00]  now now this boring sorry went off on a little tangent there didn't i now this boring radio company  you're right this boring radio company we work for they're not going to allow us to do retard  of the day that would be edgy fun stuff that people would check out on our website  did we at least do chunk of the day on onaradio.com what if we called it tard du jour  mmm it sounds sounds delicious yeah yeah it sounds fancy yeah well uh here we go and we got a lot to  do here so let's uh let's do the parody of the free credit report commercial why are all the bankers 
[00:32:30]  white like why can't they have one if you showed like why can't you have one black banker that's  getting corralled by the young black guy because that doesn't make sense you got to just have a  bunch of old white guys with the black guy and he the black guy knows more than the white guys he  knows like this more um uh i don't know he's a little more progressive than the old white guys  that don't know anything except money money we can't lend them money what are you talking about 
[00:33:00]  yeah yeah that that worked well well with that let's get into this please nancy and chris do a  little song parody about that one two three well i was surfing for a morning show which one's me  a bunch of cranky guys who were not funny and then i stumbled on this woman who's whack and now i'm  driving off to work with a built-in laugh track n-a-n-c that's nancy f-u-n-n so funny  chris and frodo and cute ct laugh so hard i thought i was gonna pee so instead of listening

[00:44:00]  now what i mean by that is that he's wearing underpants while he's singing he's not holding  up a pair of his own underpants and singing into them thank you for clearing that up oh god that's  funny because instead of a microphone right well they wouldn't arrest you for that they wouldn't be  able to hear you they'd probably just say you're muffled yeah you're singing into underwear yeah you're  not under arrest don't worry i hope she's arrested for singing into a hanky that has chloroform on 
[00:44:30]  like the vanishing she wakes up in a coffin somewhere jeff bridge is laughing  she's good yeah so what can i tell you she's good sometimes you got to give it to these guys  i would uh i would send them an application maybe i will we're holding you back you should be on the  nancy and chris show my friend i could be the next frodo who's frodo have we even heard from him  yet uh what does he do you'll hear from him he's on he's after the break yeah all right after the

[00:45:30]  are right yeah well today we're looking at a show called nancy and chris out of tampa bay florida  they're on one of those mix stations every town has a mix station yeah nothing special uh nancy and chris  with frodo and juno yeah and on the way we get to find out what the manty hose is all about  manty hose we're learning more about nancy and uh wow wow gotta love nancy nancy likes her drink 
[00:46:00]  likes getting her drank on she likes to get her drank on yes what site is this from  she she tried out to be uh kelly on regis and kelly i guess so when kathy lee left they were flying in  broads from all over america and this uh nancy broad was flown in but she didn't get the gig what's  that i smell out your breath is that uh rum or uh whiskey uh apparently let's see nancy had a couple 
[00:46:30]  of incidents she pleaded no contest charges of driving under the influence after she drove off interstate  275 into a road construction area she registered a blood alcohol content of 0.183  more than wow twice the level at which a driver is presumed impaired wait how effed up are you with  a 0.183 like 0.9 they'll don't get you right it's double right yeah i mean i mean 0.09 excuse me 
[00:47:00]  well that was back in 2002 so apparently she learned her lesson all by on may 31st 2004  she was cited for careless driving leaving the scene of an accident in st petersburg in which she left  the scene and initially denied her involvement at the collision blaming her sister police reports  that the investigating officer could smell alcohol on her breath but alexander said she had a glass of  wine after the incident because she was scared oh she's got the worst excuses where did she have the 
[00:47:30]  glass of wine on the shoulder of the road what if she was wearing one of those wine hats but it was  like a beer hat with wine glasses i sipped it after the accident oh well she likes her beverage perhaps  can you get out of stuff like that by saying it it's if you could run away from the accident and  say hey i i went to a bar because i was freaked out if your sister's sober and wants to vouch that she  was driving uh what it what's a cop gonna do but there are ways for drunk driving where they've actually  outlawed the defense in certain places where you could if a guy tested a certain blood alcohol level 
[00:48:00]  because the alcohol takes a while to get through your system they would say no he drank that uh at  a certain amount of hours before there was some slick thing defense lawyers were using i'm giving  a terrible explanation really yeah but they said you know a lot longer allowed to use that all right  well that was not helpful at all that's all right though we're gonna get right back to the audio uh  nancy and chris our featured show for this fine joctober 28th 2008 see i i said joctober 28th  yeah it's kind of it's almost done yeah uh we did the naked cowboy i don't even remember we did 
[00:48:30]  right yeah it made a underpants joke it's very funny yeah it was really very funny it really wasn't  memorable uh the gang talks to frodo finally we get to hear who frodo is and yeah about his house  warming gifts what he yeah he he moved into a house recently well that's kind of the gag he  didn't move into a house he's just throwing a house warming party to get some gifts don't give  away his jokes this guy's what are you doing this guy's good nancy once again displays her undying 
[00:49:00]  wit yes you're the worst her undying wit more audio of nancy and chris he's registered at target for  house warming gifts i love that idea because guess who's getting ready to move into their new house  this friday i am come on did you wish for a house while you're at it to warm they didn't have that on  the menu i know i don't have a house yet there lies the scam you're doing a house warming uh you're  filling out the paperwork and getting the party ready and everyone can go buy gifts why not you don't 
[00:49:30]  have a house i had a pool boy five years before i had a pool  yeah is there is that so she could have sex with him i think so is that what she meant is there  anything worse than an edgy broad on the radio so uncomfortable i had a pool boy five years before  i had a pool oh poor lou fill it in fill it in abbott 
[00:50:00]  the kid the kid dropped he dropped he's swimming in the he's swimming face face he's doing the dead  man float the dead boy float well that was some undying wit you were right sam yeah the pool boy thing 
[00:50:30]  yeah it was terrific she really uh well at least she's trying yeah oh yeah the other guy is like  captain obvious he's a hole he just loves rob schneider movies like we got what yes we got  what frodo was doing but uh just in case chris had to make sure yes you see what he's doing is  yeah i know that was very obvious in the setup yes before you piped in that's chris the gang does  material on manny hose ed here it is manny hose here's the big reveal what is manny hose and the 
[00:51:00]  broad who isn't nancy gets a good line in yeah who's the broad that's not nancy  juno i guess it must be juno was she always juno or did she change her name because that movie was  popular for for a few weeks it might have been the movie thing but i'm not sure she looks young  she's a racist she spells it j-e-w dash 
[00:51:30]  it's apparently some new fashion thing that's sweeping australia  australia they're called manty hoes  why the batman why the batman thing i don't know i was i was listening and i was trying to figure it  out and i don't know i think i know yeah because batman wore leggings maybe it's to imply that they're the  same thing as the batman oh it's apparently some new fashion thing that's sweeping australia 
[00:52:00]  they're called manty hoes i'm only sorry manty hoes that's awesome they're pantyhose for men  well if women don't like wearing pantyhose then why would a man wear them everyone from truck drivers  to cowboys are wearing to rapists to bank robbers over their face  truck drivers are wearing them no they're not it's just something she made up right 
[00:52:30]  from trannies to other trannies who's wearing many hoes it's not sweeping it's not sweeping  any country why would anybody wear manny hoes unless you cut the front out truck drivers to  cowboys are wearing them oh my god there's something wrong you'll never catch me wearing  pantyhose no oh really because you never catch them anyway  i wear thigh hides all the time easier access for gentlemen probably wearing them as he says that 
[00:53:00]  he's gotta he's gotta ruin them by cutting the back out with scissors yeah he cuts the back panel out  the control panel yeah yeah he's a rolling pink  hey that's oh look how hot you can look at many hoes everybody look to your right jimmy there's  nothing wrong with manty hoes who wouldn't want to wear them yeah i'd hate to wear them only not  because of the homoerotic but because i'm like the fat on my stomach would dangle over the front over 
[00:53:30]  the uh little waistband would look really unattractive i uh i i hate like stockings like that  like fishnets are hot on a slutty look um certain girls could get away with it but all i think of is  like i don't know dean wormer's wife in animal house and how those like her stockings must have  smelled really bad you know the toe part especially oh just like yeah yeah the other toe part just like 
[00:54:00]  powder and feet and nastiness and another part and and another part a little higher up on the hose  that's what the control panel the control panel it ain't controlling that though unless there's a  i don't know kind of uh stick up in there it's supposed to soak up all the goodness goodness is  that what it does i don't know maybe a woman could call us and tell us what the control panel is all  about for real it uh pushes the um you know the abdomen and it controls the bunt area oh yeah all 
[00:54:30]  right bring them oh my god there's something wrong you will never catch me wearing panty hoes no see i've  got a question you know how guys kind of like wear the pants really low are you going to be if  they're wearing manty hoes you're going to be able to see like the top of the manny hoes  who's laughing everybody why it's hysterical not no because the the laugh sign went on in the  studio time to laugh we haven't laughed in a few minutes just imagine people out there the manny hose 
[00:55:00]  sticking out though yeah that's crazy it's funny right it's like because you got manny hoes on under  your pants yeah you're wearing your pants low and all of a sudden instead of boxer shorts but it's  manny hoes let's see if you're gonna make it it's got to be based on something that's possible  no one would do that by the way i'm thinking what is it the batman theme because batman wore tights  it could be i'm just i it's been bothering me to listen to that batman theme going why why would 
[00:55:30]  they put it in jimmy say that already oh listen to the replay you didn't hear that why would i hear  it i think you're just kidding yeah no why would you make that point brilliantly then every day  three seconds after the batman music started yeah every day one of us that was pretty much here  another one that was pretty much the first thing jimmy said all right starting the manny hose bit  well i'll bet you maybe that's because i love when that happens i'll bet you that they play that  theme music after a few belts of booze that's how she drives all right more funny manny hose material 
[00:56:00]  so let's get right into this here here we go yeah no instead of boxers hanging out of the top it's  gonna be like the elastic she's continuing yeah why stop it oh she felt the laughs and figured all  right i'm gonna punch this up she's on to something i'm gonna tag the hell out of this  this joke yeah no instead of boxers hanging out of the top it's gonna be like the elastic strip  around the manti control top of course we wear a pair of shorts and they can be a hooters boy 
[00:56:30]  why do they play the batman music what is this groundhog no it probably has something to do with the  fact that uh batman was a queer and wore banty hose and now he's saying he's a hooters boy hooters  boy because the hooters girl all wear pantyhose and then a man would wear manty hose and shorts  and it cuts out but then spiraling just spiraling into disaster 
[00:57:00]  or so we wear a pair of shorts and then you'd be a hooters boy  that's an ugly sight this could be a whole new thing for um my friend sarah blakely who started  spanks she could just make manks manks are amazing i wore them last night they're fabulous they are  fabulous what's a spank is it underwear i don't know some kind of um a female a woman's undie 
[00:57:30]  a control thing why do they call them spanks they make it sound sexy for a fat  bitch to put her fat ass in so it doesn't seem so fat but then imagine manks manks because yeah  now they're just adding man the man thing to all womenly things a man pond that's what he yeah a man  pond guys guys suck he's a munt  yeah and then we do the bit oh yeah we change it slightly yeah just a little bit 
[00:58:00]  uh this show's a real pile of mitts  get it  of course  hi muck  we're gonna stop jocktober right there because  we can't no no more nancy and chris we're done with them out of tampa today's featured show for  jocktober 28th we have three days left of jocktober yeah they're gonna be three  out of the park days really yeah  eric's working on the commercials he's he said it's it's unbelievable how bad they are

[01:00:30]  well they were the first one well that's the other thing with radio station commercials yeah it's one and  they they uh cookie cutter it or whatever as long as the signals don't overlap right then they could do  a whole different commercial uh same commercial in a different um there's uh there's some good  ones from the 80s where they're reenacting sitcoms and um that must be great and uh action news rooms  with a lot of hijinks so could you give us a couple for after the break we're gonna we're gonna focus on

[01:03:30]  through tubes we stink i bet there's stations doing that somewhere though thinking it's that they had to  do it because if we did it you know it must be successful all right hey um yesterday i i think it's  worth a replay before we go to break yeah we had big a big a for the newer listeners really can't  talk he has a he has a problem with st words big time yeah we love this guy he's a lovable he goes 
[01:04:00]  he's a lovable oaf a lot yeah he's um he's a big man big man are you and um yeah he he twitches  a little bit he's got problems yeah but we love him otto came up with a great idea for big a yesterday  and then we took the idea and we expanded on it stole it but otto thought it'd be funny to see big  a as a bank robber running in as we're doing our radio show well obviously we're making believe we're 
[01:04:30]  in a bank and having big a yell that it's a stick up yes because timing if you're gonna be a bank  robber timing is everything of course you want to get in get out quickly we've all seen it in the  movies dark knight had a nice uh you know yeah bank robbery uh scene to start the whole movie and  it was all about timing you got to get in get out get in that getaway car this is a stick up and and  and scram before the cops get you yeah so this is big a attempting to uh stick up a bank we did a bit  on tired on my friend uh kenny's radio show about big a robbing a bank yeah we made him do a dry run

[01:06:00]  for you as the morning goes on.  We also had him warning us of a stampede.  Yeah, of course.  And we had him as the guy trying to stop an execution. 
[01:06:30]  An execution, yes.  And also the stabbing thing was pretty funny, too.  So we'll play a few more as the morning goes along here.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, I got to tell you,  there's only two days left to register  to win the $1,000  in our pole dancing for the stars competition.  Don't inhale watermelon. 
[01:07:00]  Never inhale watermelon.  Never, ever, ever.  Oh, God.  Yike.  Went down the wrong pipe, as they say.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  I see that.  Wow.  Wow, your eyes are watering.  Dude, that was...  Not good.  ...a gush of water into my lungs. 
[01:07:30]  Wow.  You know what that means.  We got to go home early today.  Yeah.  You got to get that checked out  just to be on the safe side.  You know.  Holy Jesus.  You coming back to us?  Yeah.  Coming back.  As I was saying, Anthony,  there's only two days left  to register to win the $1,000  in our pole dancing for the stars competition.  Yes.  See, I guess they have dancing with the stars, 
[01:08:00]  so we have pole dancing.  Yeah.  I finally got it.  The economy...  Another the economy sucks thing  to get people to do something else.  Oh, my God.  Enough with the economy sucks,  so now you need to do this.  Yeah.  The economy sucks.  People are losing money,  so we're thinking...  No, we're not thinking.  We're trying to help out a sponsor.  So we're thinking,  what would our audience do for $1,000?  And that's how we came up with 
[01:08:30]  O&A's pole dancing for the stars competition.  Because nothing's more interesting  than the thought process  that leads to a contest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can register online.  How many people have registered?  I mean, this is one of the greatest contests  we've ever done.  I mean, we might have to shut down  the registration process.  Two.  So two people.  And one, I'm worried about the validity.  Why?  Because the name was like Jason. 
[01:09:00]  Well, so you might want to try  to win the damn thing.  Okay.  Done.  If I was a dude down in my luck,  what the hell?  I'll roll around a pole for a while,  see what happens.  Well, you can register online  at onaradio.com  for a chance to come to the show  and pole dance this Thursday.  Now remember,  because we have awesome lawyers  that help us out with our radio show,  you're just going to be in your clothes  like dancing around a pole.  You'll be wearing a parka.  Yeah, pretty much.  The best pole dance wins,  receives the cash, 
[01:09:30]  and our stripper pole.  This contest we will spend  about two minutes with  on the air, by the way.  Yeah.  It's all thanks to the new film.  This is the important part.  Zach and Miri make a porno.  Kevin Smith's hilarious new comedy.  I saw it, and I liked it a lot.  Seth Rogen is just amazing.  It's a new comedy about best friends.  They live together,  and they've fallen on hard times.  Get it?  So to get out of debt,  they do what some of us would do,  make a porno,  in theaters everywhere this Friday.  So just go to onaradio.com  and sign up if you want to dance for us. 
[01:10:00]  Isn't Seth calling in this week sometime?  I think Thursday.  Oh, good.  Maybe during the pole dancing thing.  Okay, cool.  Which means it'll be embarrassing for everyone.  A couple actors from the same movie  talking, that'll be fun.  Oh, that's right.  Jimmy's in there.  Yeah, I'll be like,  remember that time on a set?  He'll be like, yeah, yeah.  God, I got to get the water out of my lungs here.  It helps.  Honestly, if you grab your ankles,  and I'll get behind you,  and I'll kind of like use something  to push all the fluid out of you.  Thank you. 
[01:10:30]  Kind of like the press in the Star Wars.  Yes.  A little garbage compactor.  Can you make Kenny do mouth-to-mouth  to get the water out of your lungs, Anthony?  Okay.  Or just push it on your gut  like they do on the beach,  and then you can spit it out.  You good?  Yeah, for now.  I still feel it.  It's like gurgling.  I was on the brink of drowning  on a piece of watermelon.  Why did you do that?  Well, I inhaled accidentally  as I was taking a bite  of a juicy piece of watermelon. 
[01:11:00]  That's almost impossible to do.  I don't know what happened.  Just like ran down.  It's very juicy.  Well, it's very watery.  Hence, water.  Yes, melon.  What an embarrassing way to die.  Imagine if he just dropped dead  because he inhaled watermelon.  I know.  That would suck.  It's like, oh, good.  He's trying to eat healthy.  What happens?  I should have had a burger.  Do you know how man at you I'd be?  Oh, I'd be horrid.  Jennifer wants in on the contest.  Jennifer.  Oh, yeah.  I want to know  why he comes down  and dance on the pole.  I promise I'll wear my manti hose. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  By the way, Jennifer,  my check is in the mail.  Okay, thank you.  Actually, the voice is similar, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that contest  is going to be a bust.  We all know that by now.  How can we not get girls  in here to dance for $1,000?  Uh, because...  No.  Because...  In these troubled times.  Times are tough.  We read the copy.  Yes.  Hey, because of that  awful morning show in Tampa,  we figured we need a theme song  for our radio show.  Do we? 
[01:12:00]  And this is where it starts.  Tim came up with the first one  from down the hall.  A little Opie and Anthony song.  We need it.  We can play it every morning,  get everyone feeling good  about that day's show.  Is that one of the...  Is it a feel-good song?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  It's a feel-good.  Okay.  Opie, I-E,  that's Opie  with his partner,  Anthony.  They give us news  in their own views.  And Ant really doesn't  hate the Jews.  Little Jimmy  is also there. 
[01:12:30]  He likes,  she knows that no one cares.  Make me laugh,  that's O-N-A.  The pendulum is swinging  back the other way.  Make me laugh,  make me laugh,  O-N-A.  See?  Wow.  See?  That's good.  That's what we need.  We need a song like that.  That's a pick-me-up song.  We need a feel-good song  to start the morning.  Instead, what do we do?  Horrific child death stories.  What is wrong with us?  We did start off  with a bang today, didn't we?  Oh, man, did we? 
[01:13:00]  Tim's got some pipes.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  You know what?  One over the head  would be nice.  Yeah, exactly.  Right through a stupid jawbone.  You make fun,  now this is what I do.  Every time you make fun,  this is what I do.  O-P-I-E,  that's O-P  with his partner,  Anthony.  Hi.  Give us news  and they're on you. 
[01:13:30]  That's right.  It really doesn't  hate the Jews.  Little Jimmy  is also there.  He likes females  and no one cares.  Make me laugh,  that's O-N-A.  The pendulum  is swinging back  the other way.  Make me laugh,  make me laugh,  O-N-A.  Make me laugh,  make me laugh.  I know you want  to hate it,  but it's just as good  as any other  radio show song 
[01:14:00]  that is being played  every morning out there.  I want to work  my way up to hate.  A lot of people  I'm reading here  on Pal Talk,  for some reason  just going into  Halloween things.  They're just going  boo,  boo.  Really?  And I add  boo to myself.  The Halloween joke?  Yeah.  It was all right.  Boo.  Are you sure?  Should we listen  to it again?  I think we'll give it  a little more listen,  Ope.  Just to make sure?  I think so.  A lot of people  probably didn't hear  the lyrics. 
[01:14:30]  Opie, I-E,  that's Opie  with his partner  Anthony.  They give us news  in their own views  and Ant really  doesn't hate the Jews.  Little Jimmy  is also there.  He likes females  and no one cares.  Make me laugh,  that's O-N-A.  The pendulum  is swinging  like the other way.  Make me laugh,  make me laugh,  O-N-A.  Very catchy.  It's starting 
[01:15:00]  to grow on me.  I'm starting to wish  I would have choked  on that watermelon.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  See?  That's not too repetitious.  Let's say how to-  Tempo change.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jared  in Boston listening  on BCN.  Jared.  Hey, boys.  Your show's theme song  should really be  everyone has AIDS.  Well, that would be  something because  we don't have AIDS.  That sounds a whole lot  better in my head.  But it's kind of wacky  to say that we do, 
[01:15:30]  so maybe we should.  Maybe every morning  we start with  like a little cute  little song  that gets us  all smiling  and ready to go  for the show.  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  You're homing.  Oh, P-I-E,  that's O-P  with his partner  Anthony.  They give us news  in their own views  and that really  doesn't hate the Jews.  Little Jim is also  like she knows  and no one cares.  Make me laugh, 
[01:16:00]  that's O-N-A.  The pendulum is  swinging back  the other way.  Make me laugh,  make me laugh,  O-N-A.  This is going great.  Oh, wait a minute,  though.  It gets better.  We got Tony in New York.  Tony, yes.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good, Tony.  I'm sitting here  behind a car  and it's got a  pretty interesting  bumper sticker on it.  Yeah?  Proud parent  of a child  with autism.  Are you really 
[01:16:30]  that proud?  Oh, boy.  Who is this?  Dennis Leary?  I was going to say.  I thought you were  coming on our show  in a week or two.  Yeah, that is an  annoying...  I mean, not all  kids with autism,  but just that they  have to put proud...  Yeah, it's like,  what are you doing?  Who cares?  I'm a bumper.  Let's say hi to  Toby in Iowa.  Toby.  Hey, good morning.  What's up?  Hi, Daddy.  Say, during the  football game last night,  I see a commercial  for Kevin Smith's  new movie. 
[01:17:00]  They left out  the porno part.  All it said was  Mary and the other  one.  They completely  left it out.  Yeah, Kevin was  talking about that.  For some reason,  the word porno  is very, very evil  in this day and age.  Extremely evil.  But, you know,  this is what is  just insane  about the whole thing.  We started the show  talking about  Jennifer Hudson's  seven-year-old nephew,  and if you were  watching TV,  if you weren't  working yesterday,  you got to see  the creepy SUV  just sitting there  knowing there was  a dead kid in it.  Let's make sure 
[01:17:30]  we don't use  the word porno  when we're  promoting a movie.  It's not even  a porno movie.  It's like  the word porno  is in the movie.  It's a word.  It's not a  pornographic movie.  What we find  in porno  is so effed up.  I think it's  much more disturbing  to know there's  a dead kid  on CNN  yesterday afternoon  in that SUV  with all the people  not sure if they  should start  peeking in the  windows or not yet.  You don't think 
[01:18:00]  the kid picks up  on that stuff  if it's on your TV?  Just the fact  they won't advertise  what is a legal,  non-profane title  because of a few  stupid parents.  Yeah.  I'm so sick  of hearing about  you and your  dumb kids  and what they  might see  and you might  have to answer  a question.  Yeah, you might  have to answer  a question.  They find porno  in your house.  They see it  on the computer  all the time.  It's harmless.  Yes.  The word.  I found naked  pictures once  to my stepmother  out there. 
[01:18:30]  She wasn't even  my stepmother.  She was my  father's girlfriend  and they were  taken like years  before.  These old Polaroids  when she was  about, I would  have put her  about 23, 24  when the pictures  were taken.  So I took  them out and  actually scrapped  to them.  Good boy.  Yeah.  Dad would have  been proud.  We're supposed  to be surprised  by that?  Of course.  No, it's  kind of weird  though.  Of course  you have to.  She ended  up being my  father's wife 
[01:19:00]  after many  years.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm like,  oof.  I scrapped to  that.  Well, he didn't  scrap to the  hog that was  in him too.  Let's say hi  to Joe in  Jersey.  Joe?  Hello, Joe.  Joe?  Yeah.  Hi, Joe.  Opie, I wanted  to know if it's  safe to come  back.  I changed the  channel after you  played your theme  song for the first  time.  What theme  song?  I forgot it  already.  You know, the  song that you  were playing, I  quit the fourth  song. 
[01:19:30]  Can I come  back now?  You mean  this song?  Opie, I  E, that's  Opie, with  his partner  Anthony.  They give us  news in their  own views, and  Ant really  doesn't hate  the Jews.  Little Jimmy  is also  happy.  That's  terrific.  That's  terrific.  I dare you 
[01:20:00]  to come  up with a  better theme  song for our  show than  that one that  Tim came up  with.  I dare you.  I dare you to  come up with a  worse one.  It's  impossible.  Hey, the  World Series,  yeah, they  called it after  six innings last  night, and I  think it's going  to rain all day  today, so I  don't think  they're finishing  the game  today, probably  tomorrow, but  what a great  story coming out  of Philadelphia.  World Series,  Phil's fans live  down to their  reputation, see?  Ah, live up to 
[01:20:30]  a reputation.  But this  reporter says  live down.  They live down  to a reputation.  And you know  what?  I say that  sports needs  more of this  right here.  It's getting  too family  friendly, too  safe to go to  a ballpark.  Is it?  During game  three of the  World Series  on Saturday  night, Ray's  family members  and employees  say they were  harassed and  abused by  Phillies fans at  Citizens Bank  Park to an  unacceptable degree.  Look, if you're  wearing the jersey  of the opposing  team, you deserve 
[01:21:00]  all this.  You just do.  Really?  You deserve  this, yes.  Go out with  your family and  your jerseys.  Remember when you  were growing up and  you were brave enough  to wear the jersey and  your friends would be  like, you're insane.  You know what?  You're taking your  life into your own  hands.  That's up to you.  The Phillies or  Philadelphia is like  one of the last  places where they  just really abuse  people.  Oh, yeah.  Well, listen to this.  Children were  cursed at and one  nine-year-old boy  had beer poured on 
[01:21:30]  him.  You know, what is  wrong?  I see nothing wrong  with this because the  kid was obviously  wearing a Ray's  jersey in  Philadelphia.  Yeah.  Everyone knows  you don't.  I get to see a few  Islander games down  there in Philly.  I do not wear  anything with an  Islander logo on  it.  That's insane.  Not just open up on  a guy that pours  beer on his kid.  You're in one of  those situations  where you can't  win.  You've got 10 or  12 guys going,  yeah, what are you  going to do,  pops? 
[01:22:00]  It's a horrible  situation to be in,  but you shouldn't be  wearing the Ray's  jerseys to begin  with.  And no one  probably poured  beer on the kid.  It probably, like,  in some ruckus,  got knocked down,  the kid got sprayed  or hit with it,  and they're, like,  poured beer on a  kid.  That's usually what  they do.  They do exaggerated.  How great is this?  So you've got the  children being cursed  at.  The 9-year-old boy  had beer poured on  them.  A Ray's family member  stayed locked in a  bathroom stall because  he said Philly's fans  were banging on the  walls and threatening  him.  Now this is a World 
[01:22:30]  Series, my friends.  Screw that polite  crap.  I like some good  natured cat calls as  well as the next guy,  but I don't think  that's necessary.  Go back to your  town.  That's the type of  yelling they should  do in a sports arena  for family fun.  Yeah.  Look, this is not a  question of Ray's  fans being sissies.  This is not about  being offended by  Ray's sucks chants.  We're talking about  behavior more suitable  for a prison yard  than a family  ballpark.  Were people getting  shanked? 
[01:23:00]  Someone got a balloon  of gas broke on  their head and the  next guy set it on  fire.  A guy in a Ray's  jersey burning from  the head up.  Filled a light bulb  with gasoline and  flipped the light  switch on.  But this is what we  were talking about  yesterday.  Family ballpark is  in the story.  Yeah.  Stop making  everything family  friendly.  Stop.  I can understand  things like, you  know, porno  theaters.  ballpark.  Family friendly.  They're going too 
[01:23:30]  far with this  family friendly  crap.  And it's taken  away from the  sport itself.  Hockey is really  suffering.  So what do you do  in the case where  you're at the  ballpark and  there's some  raucous fans behind  you just being  loud, obnoxious,  and yeah, like  throwing beer,  which they don't  care who it hits,  things like that.  Because I've been  in that situation  where you're just  like, love to  turn around and  just, well, say  something, but you  know, you'd get the  crap beat out of  you.  I'm a season ticket 
[01:24:00]  holder for the  Islanders.  Usually the person  that gets the beer  poured over their  head and stuff,  they're wearing the  jersey of the  opposing team and  they're really  obnoxious about it  and they deserve  everything they get.  Yes.  I have no idea what  happened in this  case, but what I've  seen, and I've gone  to a lot of games,  and I've gone to a  lot of Islander games  away, and I sit  there, no logo, and  when the Islanders  score, I do a little  tiny little fist bump  like way low with  whoever I'm sitting  with.  Michelle Obama?  Yeah, exactly.  Fist bump?  But I don't want to 
[01:24:30]  have to fight the  crowd because I'm  seeing my team  somewhere else.  I just don't, I  understand.  You need to  understand what  could happen to  you if you're  rooting for the  team too loudly.  I like to yell  fun things.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yes.  Go home, why  don't you?  Hey, you.  Why can't everybody  yell that?  Why you?  And by the way, if  they're making a lot  of noise behind you,  what you ought to do  is get a laugh out  of them.  Like you turn around  to the group and  you go, hey, why  don't you keep it  down to a dull  roar? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, gosh.  Make a laugh.  I'd love for you to  say that in jest and  I have a big ham  fist come into your  face.  How great would  that be?  Some big Polak  knuckle in my  mouth.  But yeah, I've  seen these guys  though turn around  and then try to  take on the crowd.  I always look and  go, oh, this ain't  going to be good.  Yeah, this ain't  going to work.  Just sit there and  shut your mouth with 
[01:25:30]  your jersey on because  you're not going to  win this one.  And then the  reporter goes, you  can make fun of  Tropicana Field and  you can make fun of  Tampa Bay's limited  fan base, but some  words should not be  used and some lines  should not be crossed.  And from talking to  the Rays on Sunday,  the Phillies fans  trampled all over  every acceptable  line of decency.  Wow.  Go, Phils, go.  They're keeping their  reputation, yep.  By the way, World  Series ratings, oof,  down 25%.  I'm not going to be  critical of the 
[01:26:00]  efforts we took  Saturday night.  If somebody else  chooses to be, then  so be it, says  Philly Senior Vice  President, blah, blah,  blah.  In my experience, it  is very difficult to  prevent words coming  out of people's  mouths.  And sometimes the  words that come out  are offensive.  If they are  profound, if they  are threatening, if  physical assaults  occur, we will  identify those  people and eject  them or arrest  them.  There are some  things you can't  control.  If an entire  section of fans  start chanting  the a-hole word,  there's not much  you can do.  We think we have  responded to the  complaints in the  appropriate way.  Oh, so violators  are ejected or  arrested.  And how many 
[01:26:30]  ejections were there  in Game 3?  The Philly  representative said  he didn't have  exact figures but  had been told by  Major League  Baseball officials  that there were  12 ejections slash  arrests Saturday  night.  In a crowd, and  then this guy  writes, 12 in a  crowd of 45,900.  What does this  reporter want?  Like thousands of  people to be  arrested as they're  just trying to  enjoy their team in  the World Series?  In a town known  for having the  country's most  brutal fans?  In a game that  did not begin until  after 10 p.m.,  giving fans more  booze time? 
[01:27:00]  It's over, man.  I'm telling you.  Family-friendly.  Picnics for  everybody instead of  baseball games.  The game started at  10?  By the rain.  8.30.  Oh, that was  the other night.  Yeah, they had the  rain delay and the  game didn't end  until 2.  What are you going  to do?  This isn't just  rude or profane.  Why can't I say  the word today?  Profane, right?  Profane.  Yeah.  All right.  It's intimidating  and threatening.  It is women being  called whores and 
[01:27:30]  worse.  Maybe they were.  It is children having  food thrown at them.  It is being push  shoved and jostled  in the concourses.  Pulling a train up  in one of the  sections and she's  called a whore.  Hey, that's  unnecessary.  And something is  wrong with a city  that allows it.  Now, I'm being,  let's go to Boston  and say hi to Reggie.  What's up, Reggie?  I hope you're  being a wuss.  Why?  You just are, man.  You just, you're  afraid the way you  range in the jersey?  No, first of all,  I'm an Islanders jersey 
[01:28:00]  and I'm a realist.  Whatever.  I have no problem  with what the  Philly fans were  doing to the race  fans, but I choose  not to be in the  middle of an effing  melee because I  understand it.  What's wrong with  that?  You talk about  free speech, man,  and you're afraid  to wear your jersey  to a game because  you're rooting for  the opposite team?  That's a wuss move.  He said he wore  the jersey.  Reggie, free speech  issue, Reggie.  You didn't listen.  Yeah, but you  won't say what you  want to say.  Reggie, do you  understand that I 
[01:28:30]  understand the  stance?  I take and it  would be so easy  to just go on the  air and go, yeah,  I'm the tough guy  at Madison Square  Garden wearing my  Islanders jersey and  I take on the  whole crowd.  I could have  easily said that  and got away with  it, but I'm  speaking the truth.  I choose not to  do that because I  understand how it  could be a brutal  thing.  So go shut your  effing mouth.  Hey, Reggie, I  wore a Yankee jersey  when I saw Yankees  Red Sox.  There you go.  It was in the  Yankee Stadium.  Let's say hi to  Dennis on Long  Island.  Dennis, Reggie  was a douche. 
[01:29:00]  What's going on,  guys?  I was at game  seven for  And freedom of  speech, if you want  to do that, yes, I'm  all for it, but I  think it's stupid.  I think you're  insane.  Reggie's a tough  guy.  Let's go to, yeah,  of course he is, and  I'm sure he actually  does that.  You guys there?  Yeah, go ahead,  Dennis.  What's going on?  I was at game  seven.  He'd wear that  sandwich board that  Bruce Willis wore in  Die Hard 2, was it?  Up in Harlem?  Yeah, he's that  guy.  He would do that.  Yeah, of course.  Because three, Die 
[01:29:30]  Hard 3.  Yeah, because Reggie's  a tough guy.  Absolutely.  The race fans have no  clue.  They were going up to  guys in the stadium as  we were walking out.  Great series, guys.  Maybe next year.  There was no chanting.  They had this whole  cowbell thing.  And listen, I'm a  season ticket Mets fan.  You know what?  I've never been to a  game seven.  It was great to be  there.  We all walked in, me and  my buddies.  We chose to root for  Boston.  They lost.  We sat down, but it  was absolutely, I had  no clue.  Going to Philly, and  that was it.  Then what happened?  It could be the  worst story I've ever  heard. 
[01:30:00]  We sat down and  watched.  I turned around.  We were in the  wrong seat.  The ushers showed  us.  We got it.  All right.  We're ready.  Here's a better  example.  Jim on Long Island,  there was a great, not  really a great, but  the Islanders and  Rangers, which is a  crazy rivalry.  It happened last  night in the  Nassau Coliseum.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, it was a crazy  game.  There were actually  more fights in the  stands than there  were on the ice, and  one of the craziest  ones was there was an  Islanders fan just  taunting all the 
[01:30:30]  Rangers fans with his  jersey.  Security goes over to  him and tells him to  stop, so instead of  fighting the Rangers  fans, he starts  fighting the security  guards.  Really?  That guy just wanted  a ball.  Six of them pulled  them out.  Yeah.  I mean, sometimes they  just want to fight some  people.  Yeah.  Well, they took the  fighting out of hockey  for the most part, so  thank God the fans are  keeping it going.  Keep it in the stands.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Keep it real.  Funt it out, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to  Derek in New Jersey.  Derek.  Hey, guys. 
[01:31:00]  What's going on?  Hey.  Dude, I was back in  high school years ago at  a Flyers-Devils game, and  a kid on the bus who was a  Devils fan yelled at a  Flyers fan, came on our  bus, and knocked him  out.  All right.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in  Jersey.  Steve, we're talking about  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, man, that Philly  thing, don't let that  caller tell you you're a  wuss, I hope you.  I had a season ticket for  the Eagles up in the 700  level, and the freaking, 
[01:31:30]  it was a Raiders game, and  there was a girl with her  boyfriend there who was a  Philly fan, but she had the  Raiders streamers in her  hair, like black and white.  This drunk freaking animal  comes stumbling down, rips her  out, by her hair, into the  aisle, and the Philly fan  just beat the piss out of  them.  What?  It was crazy.  Because that's what  happens.  What?  I don't want to be a  lunatic, though.  And I don't want to be a  part of that, so I will  not, like, show my colors.  Wait, the fans beat up  who?  Some chick.  They beat up the girl.  They beat up the, no, 
[01:32:00]  no, the guy, the drunk  Eagles fan came down the  aisle, saw the girl's  little streamers in her  hair, and ripped her out  of her seat, and then her  boyfriend beat up the  guy, and he was a Philly  fan.  Right.  You know, so.  Yeah, right?  It was ridiculous, man.  It's crazy there.  I don't think you should be  taking it that far, but,  you know, stuff happens.  If you're wearing that  jersey, that's not the  home team.  Thanks, guys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Let's go to Doug in  Jersey.  Hold on, Doug.  It is stupid, though, when  you think about it, like,  a bunch of guys getting  mad at each other, because 
[01:32:30]  it's just so dumb.  My team didn't do well.  How did your team do?  There are guys that, with  this shirt color, I say, are  better than the guys with  that shirt color.  Yeah.  My home team, I have  pride.  Do you?  Yeah.  What is it?  Cares.  Like, like your team, but  don't get, I could care  less.  Yeah.  Cares.  Well, good to be free  of that.  Other people take it very  seriously.  Let's go to Doug in  Jersey.  Doug.  What's up, boys?  By the way, the fuck  I went down, uh, sorry, I 
[01:33:00]  went down last year for  Giants-Eagles at the, uh,  Lake, and I saw girls  wearing Eli jerseys getting  called C-bombs walking  around.  Guys throw a beer at them.  Then they eventually, after  the Giants won, started  fighting each other.  It was insane.  It was insane.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We all know that the  Phillies booed Santa.  We don't have to do that  phone call today.  We've done it a bunch.  Uh, Barry in Philly,  what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Yeah, real sure.  We have the judges in our  own stadium.  Isn't, uh, the Eagles the  only team that has, I 
[01:33:30]  mean, we've all heard that  a lot of these places now  have jails.  Yeah.  But supposedly the Eagles  have a judge.  Well, they have an actual  state penitentiary.  Yeah.  In there, where they  sentence people to, uh,  up to 20 years, uh, in  actual prison.  They have a death row  actually there.  Yeah.  A death row.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  Just kill people down there.  Let's execute it by the,  by the eighth inning.  Uh, let's say how to  carry in Pennsylvania.  Carry. 
[01:34:00]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  So, uh, we're at a  Philly game.  I'm a big Mets fan and  I'm transplanting out here  in Pennsylvania.  Really?  Girl name?  What's that?  Go ahead.  Lift something heavy.  Where are you from  originally, pig's blood?  Stephen King novel,  you're on.  Go.  Oh, come on.  Princess Leia's real name, 
[01:34:30]  Joe.  Okay.  What do you got?  Yeah.  Well, we're at Philly game.  My buddy who looks,  he's Spanish and he looks  like he came out of  a Clint Eastwood movie.  You know, he's pure Spanish.  We're walking out.  Is his name Rosita?  I'm calling him Jew.  Screaming, go back to  New York, Jew.  Go back to New York, Jew.  I mean, this guy,  he is, they just figure  everybody from New York  to Jew, I guess, out in  Philly.  Well, all right. 
[01:35:00]  Let's go to Jason.  Yes, sweetie.  Jason.  Yo.  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  You're just reading that  article the reporters  talking about, you know,  you know, they're offended  about how the Philly fans  are, you know, treating  the Tampa Bay fans.  They don't understand.  I'm not even a Philly fan.  I'm from North Jersey.  I live down in South Jersey.  I've just been around  Philly fans for the last  10 years since I've been  living down here.  And the Philly fans  are fanatical.  Like, they are insane. 
[01:35:30]  There's fans and there's  fanatical.  No, fanatical.  Fan is actually short  for fanatic.  That's why they call them  fans.  That's why it's a fan.  Yeah.  Hence the mascot.  That's why it's a life.  If you're bad, they make  you smell the inside  of his uniform.  That's stunk.  No, but like, they just,  they just, they, they hate  their lives.  They hate their freaking  jobs.  They hate their lives.  This is like all they have.  And you get to the World  Series, this city is  starving for any one of 
[01:36:00]  their sports teams to win  a championship.  And they're up 3-1 right  now.  They're going to give  people a hard time.  I actually, I'm rude.  I'm not a Philly sports  fan, but I hope the  Phillies win.  Much better to see them  in those dirty, sickening  rays.  Oh, I want to see the  overturned cars and things  on fire.  Absolutely.  Rioting.  It'll be great.  You know, they could,  it's going to happen.  Watch out, guys.  They could bring back the  charging of the field, I'm  thinking.  Yeah.  It's about time we bring  that back into sports.  Taking some souvenirs from  the field.  Come on, Philly, I'm  counting on you.  Some grass. 
[01:36:30]  I'm counting on you.  Players.  Charge that field.  Kidnap some players.  Ryan Howard's foot, or his  hand.  Look what I got.  An ear from a player.  What do you get?  They just rip them.  With a Philly fanatic, they  use his stupid fanatic  suit as a giant toilet while  he's still in it.  That Philly fanatic.  What is it?  It's a giant green thing.  It's a fanatic.  Old plunger nose.  That's great.  It's a giant green thing 
[01:37:00]  with a plunger nose making  me root.  Great at the glory hole.  It pops that thing right  against it.  That little tongue comes  off.  I hate that Philly fanatic.  Especially since he gets  so fat around the hips.  Yes.  Why is he so fat around  the hips?  Fat ass.  Because of the cheese  steaks.  They got fattening food  down there.  Let's go to Ken in  Whitestone.  Ken. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm calling about this  season.  Now, I'm all for, you  know, respecting the home  team's turf and everything.  Yeah.  I'm a Boston fan.  But back in June, we were  at a Boston Yankees game.  Me, my wife, and my two  girls.  Boston Yankees.  When they leave.  Yes.  Oh.  It was the Boston Braves.  I was watching Babe Ruth  pitch back in 1916.  It's a funny story.  I'm 111 years old.  But for the most part,  everybody, you know,  I was dealing with the  ribbon and everything. 
[01:38:00]  And for the most part,  everybody was respectful.  The ribbon?  Watch the language, sir.  Oh, come on.  But this one guy is  chewing tobacco.  Actually, you know,  kept going, kept going.  He actually spit on my  daughter.  And I got kicked out of  the stadium for punching  the guy.  All because I had the  Boston shirt on.  This happens just about  everywhere.  Yeah.  Except maybe where the  Rays play because they're  so polite down there.  Well, that's just it.  I mean, they're not exactly  real fans down there  anyway.  And they're all like 
[01:38:30]  New Yorkers just  re-implanted down there.  Yeah.  All right.  I want to hear Kurt from  Jersey's story.  I figured as much.  Yeah, let's go.  All right.  Kurt.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Kurt.  I wanted to...  My brother was at an  Eagles game and during  the halftime show, they  had retarded kids  kicking balls.  And these scumbags  actually booed them  when they missed.  Unbelievable.  A bunch of dirtbag fans.  They booed them when  they missed.  Yeah, they were booed  when these retarded  kids were missing 
[01:39:00]  the field goals.  They do it.  They should have  booed them when they  walked out.  They made it.  They got booed.  Should have booed them  at the barbershop.  All right.  Punch it out, Matt.  Did they have them  tee up the ball  with their tongues?  Unbelievable.  Poor little lads.  All right.  Well, it happens.  It's happening everywhere.  Hey, we got a primetime  gossip as we go to break. 
[01:39:30]  Brian, Regan wants to  squeeze a phone call  in here today.  Really busy, though.  We'll try to do that.  And got some other  things to get to before.  Thanks.  Oh, some more  big A scenarios, too,  after the break.  But first, primetime  gossip with Sam Roberts.  You're back, and  primetime gossip has  some exclusive information  surrounding the mystery  of who is leaving  the Opie and Anthony  radio show.  It was weeks ago  that Opie first  mentioned that  someone was leaving,  but recently,  the Oapster brought  the topic back up  and gave us a date. 
[01:40:00]  Somebody that has  helped the show a lot  is leaving.  His last date's Friday.  Really?  Yeah.  After finding out  that someone would be  leaving the show  at the end of the week,  all we were left with  was who it definitely  was not.  I don't know who it isn't.  I don't know who it isn't.  Oh.  B-Rock.  Oh.  Because, see, he doesn't  do anything.  Yes.  But we continue to pay him.  Now, while we all know  Hoagie Boy will never  go anywhere,  PTG was able to uncover  this piece of audio,  shedding some light  on who is leaving  the crew.  Hi, Roland.  We're going to miss him. 
[01:40:30]  Where's he going?  What?  Where's he going?  What are you talking about?  Oh, you said  you're going to miss him.  Oh.  Oh, what?  That's right.  Soft-spoken,  psychotic talent booker  Roland looks to be  the one leaving the show.  And while we have  no real confirmation,  Primetime Gossip will say,  without doubt,  Roland will be homeless  by Saturday morning.  So long, Roland.  Looks like the only thing  opening Friday wide  will be a guest book  or position on O&A.  Stay tuned  while PTG keeps you updated 
[01:41:00]  as this latest story unfolds.  Hey, Jimmy,  are you excited  about our contest  that's going down  on Thursday?

[01:41:30]  This is the boss.  The boss left  the key to the vault  and we snuck in  and we said to ourselves,  you know,  you know what, dude?  It's kind of dead.  Times are tough, dude.  What if people  need a thousand dollars, dude?  So what are they going to do?  So we said,  hey, let's get rid  of this stripper pole  that we never used  thanks to the preacher  from the Poltergeist 2  being the lead attorney  for the company  and not allowing you  any nudity. 
[01:42:00]  So for a thousand dollars,  we want you to come in.  Can I be honest  with everybody?  Sure, sweetie.  The radio business  really sucks a big one  and this station needs money  so we said,  okay, we'll throw you a bone.  All right.  Or that, yes.  So you got a chance  to win a thousand dollars  as we look at awful,  like, people trying to,  like, almost strip  because we're not allowed  to have you really strip.  Yeah.  The contest on air  will be literally two minutes.  So just sign up for the contest.  You got a real good shot  at winning.  Go to onaradio.com, right? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, I guess.  Onaradio.com  to find out more.  But it's all going down  on Thursday.  It's going to be unbelievable.  Are we allowed  to do pasties at least?  Girls, you don't even  have to get naked, girls.  It's a thousand bucks.  It's going out  to the winner there  and you don't even  have to get naked.  Yeah, but you might have  to blow Jimmy in the bathroom.  Jesus.  Oh, God.  You get to strip down  to your long johns  like John Wesley Harding  before he got shot  for snoring  or shot the guy  for snoring.  John Wesley Harding.  Was that his name? 
[01:43:00]  So mean,  you want to shot a man  just for snoring.  Those are those  time-life books.  Yeah, it was  close to Kenny  and apnea.  The guy shot him.  This is the real reason.  We're doing this  for the new film  Zack and Miri  Make a Porno.  We can at least say  that on the radio  because you can't  really say that on TV.  Zack and Miri  Make a Porno.  That's going to hurt  Kevin Smith's film  if they're just calling  it Zack and Miri  because what does that mean?  What does that mean?  Make a porno.  That describes the movie.  Yeah.  Kevin Smith's 
[01:43:30]  hilarious new comedy.  It's really funny.  It stars Seth Rogen.  It's a couple best friends  living together.  They're falling on hard times.  They're like,  hey, let's make a porno.  We'll make some money  and a pair of bills.  Really funny movie, man.  In theaters everywhere  this Friday,  Zack and Miri  make a porno.  And the amazing thing  is I think the sheriff  of a glory hole  just walked in.  What?  Oh, God.  For a split second,  I thought that was  actually part of  your hoodie.  These are the fine pasties.  Those are the... 
[01:44:00]  Oh, why did you put  A and O?  That's Tracy's...  That should be  an A and H.  A ho and mo.  Steve, he calls you a homo.  Today?  Thank you.  We almost made it...  We almost made it through...  We almost made it through  one show without that, right?  Yes.  And the improv, yes, I know.  We're all acknowledging  how bad it was.  Steve just went,  oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Mucho apreciado. 
[01:44:30]  The pasties were the only thing  that Tracy did for our show.  Who?  Yeah, exactly.  Did I see the pasties?  She got us O and A pasties.  It's great.  Unbelievable.  Let's say hi to Brett.  6,000 gross of them,  I think, we have somewhere.  Yeah, let's say hi to Brett  listening on BCN.  What's up, Brett?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  I was wondering...  I'm a new listener.  Do you guys have a theme song?  Why are you acting gay?  Good question, though.  Isn't the gay...  I'm not gay.  How do you?  I'm not even going to  work with that one. 
[01:45:00]  He was putting on  some kind of...  Yeah.  A stereotypical gay accent.  Speak like that normally,  whatever, but stop.  Yeah, we don't go for  stereotypes on this show.  Never.  Never.  Why don't we ever go to  line one?  I want to hear what  do not use has to us say.  How come we can't use line one?  That's the only line I ever use.  No.  I don't know.  It's the number one line.  I'm the line one kid.  That's what they call me.  In high school,  they called me line one kid. 
[01:45:30]  Hey, we haven't played  our theme song in a while.  Is this the official theme song yet?  Jesus.  Um, yes.  This is the official theme song.  O-P-I-E, that's O-P  With his partner Anthony  They give us news in their own views  And Ant really doesn't hate the Jews  Little Jimmy is also there  He likes females and no one cares  Make me laugh, that's O-N-A  The pendulum is swinging back the other way 
[01:46:00]  Make me laugh, make me laugh  O-N-A  Holy God.  It's good, right?  No.  I think Tim really did a good one this time.  You know we're going to have  a million of these to play  in the coming weeks.  Oh.  Once the fans get involved.  You never know what to expect.  Hey, we got some flyers among us.  Would this piss you off, Jimmy?  You fly a lot.  Oh, okay. 
[01:46:30]  Runaway Poodle delays flights  at Boston Airport.  Aw.  Poodle got loose.  Oh, golly.  Choochee the poodle.  Choochee?  How long of a delay?  You want to cut to the chase?  Yeah.  You asked me if it would make me angry.  That does.  If it was a three minute delay  and they found Choochee  and he barked at it  and everybody clapped and laughed.  Yeah.  I would be one of the guys  and just laugh and clap.  Fine.  Well, before I get to that.  Okay.  You know, the writing of the story  just, wow.  Good writing.  That's terrific, Jimmy.  Choochee the poodle  is a runway runaway. 
[01:47:00]  That's cute.  Austin's Logan International Airport  officials say Choochee escaped  from the kennel  as she was being unloaded  after a flight from Detroit  Saturday night.  What is it?  In Detroit Saturday night.  Is it?  I'm not sure.  Is it warm?  Is it a little chilly?  Is it?  Nippy?  Nippy. 
[01:47:30]  Is it hot?  Can't be hot.  Is it worth all this weight?  No.  Not at all.  Oh, see.  It's so cold and sweet.  A flight from Detroit  Saturday night  and scampered across  runways and taxiways.  I'm going to answer  Jimmy's question  in a second here.  That's so cute.  Airport spokesman Phil  says the poodle  evaded airport personnel  for more than  want to guess?  30 seconds?  That's cute.  I bet it is more than 30 seconds.  17 hours? 
[01:48:00]  17 hours.  No way.  No.  And delayed  at least eight flights.  I thought you were  going to say minutes  and I thought hours  would be an exaggeration.  At that point  you shoot the dog.  Yes!  Shoot the house.  Yes!  You put on metal boots  and you break Choochee's back.  Choochee should have  just been sucked  into a 747 engine.  Well, Jimmy...  Choochee.  About 15 state police,  firefighters,  operations personnel  and even electricians  chased Choochee  late into the night. 
[01:48:30]  17 hours.  Delaying flights  for up to 30 minutes.  Where'd they find him?  Well, Choochee was frightened  and tired and hungry  when she was finally  lured to safety  with food  early Sunday afternoon.  Early Sunday afternoon.  This started on Saturday.  The dog was treated  for minor injuries.  It would have been  a major injury  if I was on that side.  Oh, please, yeah.  Opie, with the kick  to the liver  would have solved  the whole problem.  You don't know Choochee.  Good old Choochee.  Come here, Choochee. 
[01:49:00]  My Choochee's  on the runway.  Opie, could you  get Choochee, please?  Why did you kick him  in the liver?  Choochee.  It was really good  prime rib, though, eh?  With dog hair on it  after I hit the rug.  What would you do?  What would you do?  I'd have kicked  that dog in the liver.  And then we got a story  out of Buffalo, Hamburg.  I ate at a Chinese restaurant  in North Port,  and I was very suspicious.  I'm not suspicious anymore 
[01:49:30]  because of this story  coming out.  Hamburg, New York,  it's a suburb of Buffalo.  Health officials shut down  a suburban Buffalo restaurant  after an inspector  found employees  butchering a...  A...  Choochee?  An onion?  I'm hoping.  A piece of soy?  Yes.  A dumpling?  I have a feeling  when I say what it was.  A nice, marbled piece of beef. 
[01:50:00]  I say a lot of people  are not eating breakfast  when I give the next line here.  Who's eating Chinese food  for breakfast?  Exactly.  An inspector found  employees butchering  a dead deer  inside the business.  Ah, okay.  So instead of using beef  and they're beef and broccoli,  they're using deer.  That's right.  Welcome to Uncle Ted's  Chinese restaurant.  We've got...  We got venison patties.  We got venison rolls.  Venison rolls.  That's right.  We got venison dumplings.  We got bullet drinks. 
[01:50:30]  All right, Ted, we get it.  You're right.  We're wrong.  Everything's about your hunting.  We get it, Ted.  We get it, Ted.  You use every part  of the animal.  You use the horn.  You just add so we know.  Jimmy, speaking of Ted,  you're not going to believe this,  but the owner's name is Ted.  Of course it is.  Teddy?  It's my establishment.  Teddy Wong?  Teddy.  Teddy Wang?  Ted, uh...  Teddy Wong?  Teddy Wong?  Teddy Wong?  Ted owns China King.  My little black book.  His name was in there.  Teddy Wang?  Hey, F and Charlie Chan. 
[01:51:00]  That's the reservoir dogs.  Yeah.  Dead deer inside the business.  The health department officials.  Colby?  They got a tip Friday  about a dead deer  in the China King restaurant.  Yeah.  An inspector soon arrived  and saw the deer  being butchered in the kitchen.  They were using deer  in their dishes.  Cool.  I'm telling you,  I ate at a place in Northport  and I just knew  as I was eating this thing,  I lasted one bite  and I went,  oh my God,  this is not chicken.  You know something?  I have no idea what it was, 
[01:51:30]  but I have no doubt  that it was something  that you're not supposed  to be eating  unless you're really hungry  and really poor.  I've had beef and broccoli  at some point  that tasted  and smelled like horse.  I was like,  this smells like a horse.  And, you know,  I threw it away.  It just tastes  and smells slightly gamey  and you're like,  there's no way  this is chicken.  I'm always saying,  when in doubt,  throw it out.  Yes.  My dad always said,  when it smells like cologne,  leave it alone.  It smells like fish, 
[01:52:00]  a tasty dish.  Officials don't know  whether the deer  had been killed  by a hunter  or a vehicle.  Might have been  a road killed deer.  They said there was  no indication  that deer meat  was served to any customers.  The message  on the restaurant's  answer machine Monday  says it was closed  because of family emergencies.  Yes, the Deers family  wanted the body back.  And there was an indicator  that they served it in dishes.  They were carving it up  in the kitchen.  That's an excellent indicator  that it was served in dishes.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:52:30]  What the hell do you think  they were doing?  Excuse me,  there's an antler  in my miso soup.  You ever have venison?  No.  That's my knowledge.  Apparently I have  and I didn't realize it.  Yeah, who knew?  Hey, there's a hoof  in my wonton soup.  Can I have my money back?  I don't know  if it's a hard wonton.  That's exactly how  they sound in a Chinese restaurant.  Of course,  because, you know,  being accurate.  Wouldn't it be fun  to be able to actually  do the accent  and then talk about  the deer being in there  and perhaps some other game  being in the food  and make a whole little bit of it?  But, of course, 
[01:53:00]  they would be so offended  that you can't do that.  Because John Liu's a wimp.  Glenn in Jersey,  how are you?  And John Liu  won't come on our show  to discuss this.  Of course.  I just want to discuss this.  Like, two human beings  with intelligent brains.  I missed the English word  for a bathroom.  Why don't you come on  to our show?  Ha ha.  I showed him.  We've had many requests  to have John Liu come on  and explain  what the problem is  with this thing.  Get the other side of this  and he just refuses.  Glenn, what do you got? 
[01:53:30]  Hey, boys,  can I have a quart  of Bambi and broccoli?  Ho ho!  Well, you know,  there you go.  There you go.  Bambi and broccoli.  There's some safe  Chinese jokes for you.  Yeah.  No accents, please.  Well, let's go to Anthony  on Long Island.  It's right here.  Anthony!  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  What's wrong  with the Chinese food we got?  It tastes pretty good.  What's some of them dishes?  What's all those Chinese dishes?  We got beef and broccoli.  General Chow.  Beef and beef and beef.  Beef and beef and beef. 
[01:54:00]  A roll.  Sweet and sour pork.  General Chow's yak.  How awful.  All right, hey.  Sweet and sour squirrel.  Creeps.  Chipmunk and broccoli.  Yuck.  Almighty.  No kidding.  Why don't we do  a little big A scenario here?  Is that pink?  I think so. 
[01:54:30]  She's got her rock moves, man.  What is she doing now?  Yeah, she's like doing  a Pat Benatar with blonde hair thing.  Yeah, but she's got another  stupid hit song.  She's a little manly.  This chick knows how  to get the hit songs out there.  A little manly, but...  She's got her rock moves.  A little doable.  Oh, God, I wish I heard  what they were saying.  Yes.  Oh, that banter between all them  on the Today Show.  Hopefully they're doing weather  and they said,  it's raining out.  What do you have to say  about that, you fat pig?  And Al's like,  yeah, you're right at this.  He is getting fatter again, man. 
[01:55:00]  I love it.  And he's got a yellow raincoat on.  Too close to Halloween there, Al.  Too close to Halloween.  Looks like a giant pumpkin.  Like a school bus.  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Another big A scenario.  Big A, for the new people, Anthony,  what?  He can't say his ST words.  We know that.  He stammers a lot.  He sweats a lot.  He's a huge individual.  And he just makes sounds like,  I was,  I saw you yesterday 
[01:55:30]  on the street.  And he looks like Peter Griffin.  He's got the,  he's got Peter Griffin's body.  So we,  Otto came up with this bit.  It's a brilliant bit, by the way.  Big A scenarios.  In this scenario,  Big A is the guy  that has to barge in  in the middle of an execution  and stop the execution.  Yes.  And once again,  you know.  It's,  you know,  the governor  made the phone call. 
[01:56:00]  Big A must have taken the call.  And he's now running  into the death chamber  to say,  please stop the execution.  Right.  That's all he has to say  before this guy fries.  This is how it went down.  A Big A scenario.  All right.  You being found guilty  of the crime of murder  in the first degree,  are hereby to be.  Come and do it.  Danton has granted us. 
[01:56:30]  Why?  We got to pry this guy.  Us.  Us.  Up.  Execution.  We got the stampede one  and we got the stampede one  is the one that I really like. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah,  and it was Governor Stuart Stanton.  I believe,  yeah.  Has granted a stay of execution.  Yeah.  Yeah,  stop the execution.  We got the stampede one  is the one that I really like.  Yeah, I like that one.  We'll play that tomorrow.  We're going to the FU line  as we head to break here.

We were going to move on  with the Opie and Anthony show  but we're getting an update  on the Chinese restaurant 
[01:59:00]  outside of Buffalo.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Let me read this one, please.  Cute story.  You guys jump in when you want  but I want all the goodness  in this story.  For the people  just tuning in  because it happens  all the time  every 15 minutes  you get a brand new audience  when you do a radio show.  Apparently.  Unless you're a psychopath  that has to listen  to every second of the show  every day  you know who you are.  Oh my god,  where do I find today's show?  I had a dentist appointment. 
[01:59:30]  What's going on  with this restaurant  in Buffalo?  Well...  Before the update, please.  Yeah, they found  they found a deer  in the kitchen.  Oh!  Which means  that they  they were  using deer meat  Oh!  in their dishes  which was  you know  you're not supposed  to do that  if you're saying  beef and broccoli  it's supposed to be  beef and broccoli  not deer meat  Oh! 
[02:00:00]  right  and broccoli  and to be fair  they're not sure  if the deer  was used in their dishes  just yet  but come on  you know  we can figure  this one out  right?  The deer  was being sliced up  Yeah  in the kitchen  Yeah  Alright  I need this knife  mama son  It's a sin  to leave a hoof  What is it?

[02:01:00]  Well listen to the update  We get to hear  from the restaurant owner  Yeah this is coming out  this morning  I guess  that's an older story  from yesterday  We're learning more  about a Hamburg restaurant  shut down  after employees  were found  slaughtering a deer  inside  It turns out  the establishment  has a long history  of health code problems  Here's the witness  account  I watched him  drag it through  the parking lot  and he dragged it  through the front door  of the China King restaurant 
[02:01:30]  Jesus  And I said  this is just not right  so I reported it  to the Hamburg police  and reported it  You don't have to use  reported twice in your  No or dragged  Right  Health officials  shut down  the China King  on South Park Avenue  last Friday  after receiving  that tip  We obtained  health department  records for China King  on that day  and for the last  five years  On the day in question  the inspector  found the deer  on the kitchen floor  with its legs  cut off  and placed in the sink 
[02:02:00]  There were blood marks  on the floor  leading from the front door  into the kitchen  What is that deer doing?  They're bathing!  Yes  His legs are falling off  We're putting them  back on to free him  Disgusting  They should be shot  Yeah  It was some health  code violation  It was so disgusting  they closed the restaurant  immediately  They didn't even  wait  On that same day  the inspector also  found that the  refrigerator  ready for this  was too warm  So you're getting 
[02:02:30]  meat that isn't  kept at the right  temperature  We'll be in a  restaurant owner  You gotta take that  stuff very seriously  Your fridges  have to be  a certain temperature  Nobody likes  a lukewarm fridgy  No  Well, the restaurant  has a history  of cooling problems  dating back to 2003  In 2007  the store had  a cockroach problem  Why would anyone  eat here?  I don't know  Who's eating  at this place?  Who's eating  Who's eating  Who are these  warm, cold stuff

It needs a full report  Mr. Mountain Dew  He entered the  Pendulum Contest  And this entry  Is amazing  It really is  Who thought

[02:20:00]  Swinging  Swinging back  The other way  Because the pendulum  Swinging back  Swinging back  The other way  The pendulum  Is swinging  Swinging back  The other way  Get out of my way  Get out of my way  Just a little piece  I don't like it 
[02:20:30]  It sounds like  Queen's song  Literal Jim  That's great  I have a feeling  He's done that  To a bunch of other  Songs or something  That is good  Way too good  Bravo to Mr. Mountain Dew  Leaves you wanting more  Doesn't it  Yes it certainly does  Yes  But what else  Can you do with it  Because you gotta  Just work with the hook  We got some potty mouth  Going on  On ESPN  This time around  Oh someone  Slip  Oh yeah 
[02:21:00]  They slipped  Slip of a lip  An old F word  Came out  Ah  Fudge  What is this  Oh thanks  No not fudge  That's not a curse  Literal Jim  Oh my god  I'd like to welcome  Those of you  Who are watching  On ESPN 2  This is ESPN News  Alongside Daniel Sargent  I am Robert Flores  And we've got  Plenty of college  Heaps coming up  And  We are going to 
[02:21:30]  Show you  Basketball  Basketball  I feel confident  In that fact  Had plenty of  College basketball  Also NBA basketball  Spurs  And the Suns  Phoenix riding  An 11 game  Win streak  Coming in  Another great finish  At the Big East Tournament  Jerry McNamara  In Syracuse  Facing number one  UConn  Under 40 seconds left  UConn down two  Until Rashad Anderson  The three  Gets UConn  The first lead  Of the game  72-71  It's 74-71  Until Jerry McNamara  For the tie 
[02:22:00]  You hear her go  Also  Did she get deuced  Or something  I don't know  No no  I think it's such  A clusterfuck  Happening  It sounds like  They were trying  To go to a clip  They couldn't  So they were  Stretching and talking  And then the clip  Just came in  On top of them  Talking  So  She just says  What the fuck  Was that  And then you  Kind of hear her go  I gasp  I have a problem  With the clip  Were we going to hear  The entire sports center  Before we got to the  The game 
[02:22:30]  Before we got to  You know what  I left it in  Because she really  Stumbles at the beginning  I think something  Happened with the  Teleprompter  Where she  She just froze  Immediately  She's like  We're going to  Watch some  And she's kind of  Waiting for someone  To save her  Is this live  Or were they taping it  I think that was live  I'm going to say  It wasn't live  But I don't think  They would leave that in  Yeah why would they  Leave it in then  They like to be  It's an engineer  That got a hold of  And threw it up  On YouTube  Travis is saying  That most sports centers  Are live  All right 
[02:23:00]  Who am I  Who knows  Let's say hi to  Brian and Philly  Go Phillies  Brian how are you buddy  Hey good morning  Good morning Brian  Opie I was wondering  If you happen to  Take a picture of  E-Rock  So we could all  Remember the day  We spilled the wax  Remember that creep  The day we  Spilled the wax  What was the guy's name  Mr.  Mr.  Mr.  Ghoul  Yeah Mr.  Pedo  What an awful  Awful thing  Mr.  Coolest guy  In the neighborhood

[02:24:00]  Something to go down  But  Oh  That's all we can say  For now  What are we waiting for  I can't say  I  I can't say  It's a secret  I don't like secrets  Yes it is a secret  It's always being  Kept from me  No it's a secret  Be quiet  Jimmy's taking a picture  Be quiet 
[02:24:30]  Why are you taking  Our picture  Because I love you  Well the Obama thing  Oh you mean his  Candidacy for the  Presidency of the  United States  Oh Mr. Mac  Thank you  Kevin from Connecticut  We were trying to go  A day without doing  Politics  Because I think  At this point  What are we  Seven days out  Right  A week from today  That's it  Holy shit  I think people  Are really sick  Of the whole process  Well they are  But it's on  Everything  It's happening 
[02:25:00]  It's happening  Everywhere  They're talking about it  So you gotta  Bring it up somehow  Mr. McGregor  Actually  Mr. Mac for short  Mr. McGregor  That was it  That was it  That's right  Yeah  So well you got the  Skinheads thing  Is this a real threat  Or is it  One of those goofy  Like threats  Couple of skinheads  I'm leaning toward  Goofy  I'm thinking goofy  Because they had some  Wacky ideas  Because they wanted  A poll  Yeah  In conjunction 
[02:25:30]  With an attempted  Not attempted  But the thought  The plan  They were gonna go  On a killing  An ill-conceived plan  They were gonna go  On a killing spree  And it was gonna  End with them  Speeding really fast  Toward Obama  And attempting to  Kill him  By shooting out  The window  Right  While they wore  Tuxedos and top hats  Which  I mean  What the hell  Is that about  I didn't really feel  Like reading this morning  Why the tuxedos  And top hats  I read  And didn't find out  Why  I don't know why 
[02:26:00]  I think  To be well dressed  What do I know  Maybe they wanted to  Play puttin' on the ritz  Too  Puttin' on the ritz  Da da da da da  Taco  So that  Yes  Taco did  Puttin' on the ritz  Right  They  Yeah  There's a couple  Of skinheads  I guess they wanted  To start some kind  Of race war  Yeah  So what they were  Gonna do  Was kill  88  Why 88  88 is a very  Significant number  With neo-nazis 
[02:26:30]  Why  Because  The eighth letter  Of the alphabet  A, B, C, D, E, G  No  H, I  What's the significance  Of I  No  No  No you missed  One  H  A, B, C, D  If you tell me  G, H, I  Oh J  A  No  I almost had you though  I was doing  All right wait  A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I 
[02:27:00]  Yeah  I  Okay  They were gonna kill  88  You know  88 people  Is that for the H, H  Is that for Heil Hitler?  Heil Hitler, yes.  Yes, it is, Jimmy.  Yes, 88.  And they were going to kill 14 of them.  How's Harry also works.  Hey, Hank!  They were going to kill 14 of them by decapitation,  because 14 is also a significant number,  because there are 14 words in their creed  that spells out their whole thing on how, you know... 
[02:27:30]  What is it?  Just recited from memory.  I'll just wait until Steve from Bayshore posts it.  Wow, that's a lot of blood.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a bit messy, though.  And of course, they would all be black people  that they were doing this to,  and then they were going to cap it off  with the killing of Obama, which...  How are they going to keep the blood off 
[02:28:00]  their white tuxedos and top hats?  It never would have stayed clean.  They would have needed some kind of,  at least one of those tied stain sticks.  Sure.  They'd carry that with them, with their ammo.  Uh-huh.  And stay clean and tidy.  Uh-huh.  For the big act.  Right.  But...  And what was the big act?  Am I right?  The big act was them going to do...  They were going to pretty much do a drive-by  and just fire at Obama from their car.  And this was what their plan was. 
[02:28:30]  Two guys.  No big conspiracy there or anything.  It's two kooky guys deciding that they were going to start...  And they said they were fully prepared to die doing it.  Yeah.  I would hope so.  They wouldn't be getting away.  No, I don't think they'd be getting away from that one.  No.  That's definitely one of those...  Who the hell did they kill in The Godfather 2 at the airport?  Oh, Hyman Roth.  Hyman, yeah.  Hyman Roth.  That's one of those,  well, you're going to get him,  but you ain't going anywhere.  What do you say?  I'm a Jew returning from Israel or something? 
[02:29:00]  I'm looking for...  Yeah.  Some sanctuary or something.  But what in the tuxedos and...  I'm obsessed with the tuxedos and top hats.  Who isn't?  Because if you're walking around with a tuxedo and a top hat,  top hats aren't very popular these days.  Maybe you distract...  Someone's going to ask questions.  You distract Secret Service by taking the top hat off and go,  watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat.  And as they're watching and waiting,  the other guy is doing the bad business. 
[02:29:30]  Tiptoe around?  Yeah.  With that tiptoe sound effect that you use on cartoon?  Like, abracadabra,  and they're all just fixated on the top hat.  Yeah.  The hats!  Ling-a-long-a!  Unbelievable.  Well, this is what Obama had to say.  These skinheads in Tennessee,  the ATF breaking up...  Yeah, maybe he's in here somewhere.  Who knows?  These skinheads in Tennessee,  the ATF breaking up,  purported assassination,  not just aimed at you,  but aimed at African Americans.  What's your reaction to that? 
[02:30:00]  You know, look,  I think what's been striking in this campaign is  the degree to which  these kinds of hate groups  have been completely marginalized.  That's not who America is.  That's not what our future is.  You know,  what our future is,  what's reflected in this rally here today.  Does it worry you  about your own safety?  I've got the best folks in the world.  Secret Service.  And, Senator,  I hope you're coming back to Pittsburgh.  Thank you.  Great to talk to you.  What is it going to take  to hear Obama  get, you know,  a bit uptight and angry? 
[02:30:30]  Let's just put it that way.  No, he's not angry at anything.  He's smooth,  no matter what you throw at him.  He's just like,  well, you know,  I got the best Secret Service right here.  Everything's fine and dandy.  Yeah.  What do you think about  the two wackos  in the top hats  that wanted to drive toward you?  And, ah, well,  this isn't America.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  They've been marginalized.  Right.  I don't really think  these white supremacists  and skinheads  have been marginalized.  I think they're sitting back  and waiting to see who wins  to tell you the truth. 
[02:31:00]  I think it's one of those situations  where you'll see more of them.  You really think  there's going to be problems?  I think there's going to be problems  with the first black president.  I absolutely think  during his time in office  that the Secret Service  is going to encounter  some problems.  You know,  there are people in this country  that aren't very open-minded.  Have you ever seen  the presidential motorcade go by?  I did once.  It's almost impossible  to get within a mile  of those cars.  Just to even look at it.  History has taught us anything. 
[02:31:30]  That's what I mean  in Orange Watch.  Dude, it's almost impossible.  I mean, just when he comes  into the city,  they close down block after block.  It's unbelievable  how secure these guys are.  The thing is...  Yeah, they have a bunch  of cars going by.  They have the,  oh, hey, here,  look at me,  presidential,  what is it called?  The presidential limo?  The presidential limo?  He's obviously not in that.  See, the thing is...  And then they have  dumb vans go by.  I'm thinking he's got to be  in one of those vans.  Why would you, like...  It's easy to explain to you. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  You're not trying  to assassinate the president.  I just want to take a look at him.  Yeah.  That's even impossible.  Anyone with a valid plan  that was trying  wouldn't just step up  and go,  I wonder what car is it.  Like, that's why,  you know,  they plan things out.  Right.  They wait for vulnerable moments  and stuff throughout history.  But that's the point of making it.  They usually catch them  during times  when they've been vulnerable  and open to that. 
[02:32:30]  When you just see spectators  looking and going,  well, I don't know  what car he's in.  I also...  That's for the average Joe  that just doesn't, you know...  But that's what I'm getting at.  I don't know  where they would find  those vulnerable moments.  I was in the same hotel  as President Bush in Arizona  when stupid Fareed  flew me out  for a radio conference.  It turned out  I stayed a couple extra days  and Bush was staying there.  It was unbelievable.  They...  Like, he had to go up a stairs  and down a hallway  that was exposed to the lobby.  So what this hotel did, 
[02:33:00]  they covered that with canvas.  So if he was to walk up the stairs,  I don't even know if he did.  Yeah, no one could see.  No one could see  when he was walking  just in case someone  was, you know,  lucky enough to figure this out  and be in the lobby  with something that could harm  the president.  They're very secure.  They think of everything now.  They're very secure.  When they did the Republican  National Convention here  and Bush was slated  to speak at the Garden,  across the street  from Madison Square Garden  there's a block-long  massive post office. 
[02:33:30]  I mean, it's literally  like a full city  block and avenue.  It's one of the biggest buildings  you've ever seen.  And that's where he was  coming into the city.  So he was going to go  from the post office.  He had to cross  7th Avenue, 8th Avenue  to get to the garden.  So they built  an over-the-street  like walkway  where a golf cart  could drive.  But you could,  he was brought in  like from 9th Avenue  from these giant bay doors  where they back in  tractor trailers.  So basically,  they would bring him  into this giant building 
[02:34:00]  and you would never  see when he was  crossing over  into the garage.  That's a people's main game  with the hotel.  He wasn't just standing  hailing a cab.  No, because he's  the president.  I saw a man one time  and I said,  are you the president?  He goes,  no, I'm not.  I'm an older man  hailing a taxi.  But I've been told  I resemble him.  And then we sucked  each other's cock  in the men's room.  But that's what  I'm getting at too, Jimmy.  So you don't know  when he's crossing the street.  You have no idea  because it's all covered.  It's like a covered bridge.  So you're like,  what are you,  what, you're the,  see, it's scary 
[02:34:30]  to even talk this way.  But let's say you're  the assassin at that point.  What are you going to do?  Just start guessing?  Like, ah, maybe he's  walking now.  And take your shot?  They have thought  of everything, it seems.  Senator Palantyne,  once he did take a cab  and he talked to the cabbie  and the cabbie said  that New York  was a dirty place.  Taxi drive.  Best way to do it  is when those cars  go by, you yell,  hey, Prez,  and the guy  that looks is him.  Yeah.  It's like, damn,  got me.  All right, well,  there's some controversy 
[02:35:00]  over this Sarah Palin, too.  Yes.  You hear about  fellow Republicans  hate this broad?  They're like,  starting to say  that she's in it  for herself  and she's the one  that wins in the end,  not our party,  blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, then why do they  allow this shitty piece  to go through?  That's a very good question,  Jimmy, a very good question.  Yeah, who the hell  is, did McCain  actually pick her  and say,  I don't care,  I want her in?  Or was it a party decision? 
[02:35:30]  It had to be  a party decision,  but I'm sure  some of the members  were against it  and they're speaking out,  but of course  they're not using  their names or anything.  It's all like,  you know,  anonymous crap,  but they're not happy  saying she's the one  that wins,  not our party.  Look at all the exposure  she's gotten.  It's all hush, hush.  You know what makes you feel  like a few years  have slipped under your belt?  Yeah.  When you watch  an AARP commercial,  and the star  of the little vignette 
[02:36:00]  that they're doing  between this driver  and the police officer,  the driver of the car  in the AARP commercial  was the star  of the softcore movie  Fairy Tales  that used to play  on Home Box Office.  I saw that movie.  I love that movie.  Yeah, and Cinema 100  back in the 70s.  Jack and Jill  did some fucking  before they...  Yeah, and there were midgets  and midget fucking  and all kinds of  fucking going on,  and he was the prince  that went through  all of this  fairy land. 
[02:36:30]  How do you know that?  I don't know.  It's him.  That's fucked up.  I know it's him.  I would never...  That's Zell.  I would never pick him out.  The white fairy land, man.  Sam and he's doing  AARP commercials  and there he was  just fucking these...  Dude, when my parents  would go to bed...  Bims.  They didn't have, like,  porno scheduled  every night, right?  It was always, like,  it was hit or miss.  Yeah, late night.  Some nights they would  go to bed.  I'm like,  hey, Dad, the Knicks,  they're playing the Lakers.  You know, the game's  starting at 10,  11 o'clock at night. 
[02:37:00]  I'm going to stay up  and watch the Knicks,  blah, blah, blah.  As soon as they went upstairs,  man...  Okay, my boy.  I was hoping that, like,  that movie or some  of those other ones  were top on.  Cheerleaders was another one.  Just big, hairy muffs, though.  You watch Cheerleaders.  I had just recently seen it.  The muff on these girls  are so big and hairy.  Yeah.  And there's a shower scene  that goes further  than the Porky's shower scene.  That's...  I was like,  wow, and I found this  really, like, hot. 
[02:37:30]  The goal was,  the Cheerleaders,  see,  they were going to  the opposing football team  and fuck the shit out of them  so that they couldn't play  the next day  because they'd be all tired.  And I think...  I understand,  but the woozy thing  I never got.  Like, all of a sudden  they would show the players  and they'd be like,  they could barely concentrate  on anything after the fact.  I don't know.  All that fucking...  Yeah.  With all that hair.  Fucking...  Fucking...  Fucking...  You got tits  that got hair on them. 
[02:38:00]  The best scene in that  was the father  getting a little action.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The father got some action  just watching TV  and then the slutty cheerleader  came down for milk or something.  And the father guy  in all those movies  was like,  well,  what have we got here?  And there's always  this creepy guy,  oh,  why didn't you come in?  Oh, hi, Sally.  Hi.  Well,  where are the rest  of the girls?  I don't know  if we should do this.  Oh, my,  what are you doing?  Right.  Oh, this isn't  something we should be doing. 
[02:38:30]  My wife's asleep upstairs,  but if you want to continue...  Oh, oh.  Well, Susie,  you are a good friend.  You're so right.  They all talk like that.  We're just all awkward  and goofy.  The fur voice  would come out immediately.  Well.  Well.  Hello, Susie.  Why don't you come in  and sit out?  No, I'm just watching television.  Oh, I wouldn't do that  if I was you.  No.  Oh, what are you doing there?  That's my zipper.  Right.  Can we find some of those lines?  Oh, fantastic. 
[02:39:00]  It might be hard, I know, but...  Yeah.  Speaking of hard...  Can you do that voice  all day?  Yeah.  No problem.  Why are you touching me like that?  It's always like,  why are you down here?  Oh, I couldn't sleep,  so I came downstairs.  Well, I'm old enough  to be your father.  Oh.  Oh, Mr. Jones.  Oh, Mr. Cool Me Up.  Right.  Oh, Mr. Cool Me Up. 
[02:39:30]  Cheerleaders,  Bill Kaye from Philly,  and what was the other one?  Fairy Tales.  Yeah, Fairy Tales.  Yeah, when that shit was on,  oh, man,  when the Knicks game  synced up with a West Coast run  and the porn hit on...  Oh, man, I was in heaven.  Ah, the perfect storm.  I was in heaven, girl.  Oh, it was the perfect storm,  all right.  In your pants.  Then you hear noises upstairs  quickly, oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah, now we date ourselves,  got to run to the TV  and change the channel.  Yeah, no remote.  No, you were really  taking a chance. 
[02:40:00]  Click that one switch over  on the box, on the TV.  Yeah.  The scariest moment  I ever had  was banging some chick  on the couch  in the living room  when her parents  were asleep  right upstairs.  And all I kept hearing  was steps,  was feet coming down  the steps.  and it just kept  scaring the bejesus  out of me.  You know that was  the father.  He knew exactly  what was going on.  He was trying to scare you  out of it,  so he was just going 
[02:40:30]  like this from his bedroom.  And you have to do  that quiet fuck  where you're just like...  We haven't done that  in a while.  And the girl's like...  Remember that?  She's making noise.  No, that's when you're  fucking in the same room  as other people.  You go on a ski trip  or something,  you can't afford crap,  so you have, what,  ten couples in one room?  In one room,  all a bunch of couples  and you're just  trying to fuck  and you make that sound  that goes like...  And you're doing  the slowest fucking 
[02:41:00]  strokes possible  to not make anything  squeak.  And you just...  And then she goes like...  You gotta go...  Put the pillow over her face.  What about the one person  that gets the bed  and you hear the one...  That's hitting the fucking... 
[02:41:30]  It's hitting the wall.  It's the crib.  Nice.  Oh, it's terrible.  Shut up.  You're gonna wake up, everybody.  Do you know one of the  sexiest things ever was?  In Taboo 2 at the end  of the movie  when the father's laying  in bed with the mother 
[02:42:00]  and the daughter comes up  and she starts sucking  the father's cock in bed.  Jeez.  It's so...  That is taboo.  ...fucking hot, man.  And then he wakes up  and she's like,  Shh, you'll wake mommy.  Oh, no.  Dude, it's so sexy.  And she starts fucking  blowing him again  and then he fucks her  and again...  And he makes a noise  and she goes,  Shh, daddy.  Be quiet.  You'll wake mommy.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  It's fucking...  Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  When she pulls his dick out 
[02:42:30]  and she's like just  licking the tip  and looking to see  if she wakes him,  oh, Dorothy LeMay,  Eric Edwards,  and Honey Wilder's asleep.  That is a sexy fucking scene.  Sexy enough for a fart  to blow out.  That's a verbal exclamation point.  But they have to fuck quietly  because the mother's on the bed.  I thought you farted.  No, I don't fart.  No, because I was...  I looked toward you  just as that fart  that Jimmy just let go go  and I saw you like a baby,  like your eyes went like...  No, because I just went like,  oh, man. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, okay.  No, I wait till I...  Let's go to Chris in Louisiana.  Get the truck  and about 10 or 12 cubic feet  of gas comes out of my ass.  Chris, Louisiana,  what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Han.  I wanted to ask you,  since when did old 70s  become Harry Carey?  I didn't really hear  Harry Carey in that.  No, it's like,  hey, what are you doing?  Harry Carey is more like that.  Yeah.  You know, he had a wackier voice.  I think Carey was a douche.  It was wacky.  It certainly was.  The man was wacky,  but it's like... 
[02:43:30]  I'm going to come down your throat.  You fucking well  better swallow it all.  You let one drop spill  and I'll whip your ass so hard  you won't sit down for it.  Wait.  I'm coming, you dumb bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're coming, aren't you?  Uh, let's say hi to Scott in Texas.  Scott, how are you?  Mother's made some cookies.  Perhaps you want some...  Oh, what are you doing?  I'm baking, you silly cunt.  Hey, what are you doing there?  Why, someone might walk in. 
[02:44:00]  Oh.  I'll always like that.  Didn't take much at all.  He's just...  Yeah.  Scott in Texas, how are you?  Hey, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey.  Hello.  How's it going?  Well, uh...  The other, uh...  A couple years ago,  my, uh...  My best friend and his girl were, uh...  They were wanting to fuck  and I was in the room.  We were all watching American Psycho  and he sent me a text message  and was like, uh...  Hey, man, you need to leave the room  because we're about to get our fuck on.  And I was like, uh... 
[02:44:30]  Well, I was on the computer.  Fuck on.  I just turned the chair around  and they fucked, like,  less than maybe a foot by me.  It was fucking...  It was really awkward.  Why didn't you leave the room?  Yeah, you're the...  Cock barker.  I was...  Yeah, I was a nerd.  I was playing some EverQuest,  you know, Anthony.  Ew.  Did you at least prepare the bull?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, did you prep...  Did you prep the area?  Get it sloppy wet  and then guide it into the mare?  Cuckold.  I'm a good friend.  I'm a good friend.  Yeah.  All right.  Play with his balls a little.  Yeah.  Just to you. 
[02:45:00]  Finger in the ass a little.  Just...  As you're finger in the ass,  you just say,  God, I am a silly goose.  What are you doing?  Oh, stop.  Oh, come on.  Why?  Where are the rest of the girls?  Mother will be down.  Right.  Calls his wife mother.  She made cookies for you girls.  It's way past your bedtime  and what are you doing?  We're going to take a break.  We might be franchising  in the very near future, huh? 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  We will be franchising soon.  And then we've got  a Sarah Palin story,  some more porn talk.  I want to play Joe's pendulum  for Jimmy.  But I don't think we have time, right?  It's kind of long.  We can do it after.  Maybe we'll do it after  we do what we're going to do.  So, all right.  We will be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:46:00]  Hello.  Waiting for a special someone  to call on the phone here.  Yes.  Not there yet.  So, it's got some time.  Chip.  How are you doing, Chip?  Good, stupid.  How are you?  You want to plug your book?  Yes.  It's coming out November 4th.  It's called  Blubberneck Wax Tits.  And, you know,  it's a scathing review 
[02:46:30]  on incompetence  in the radio industry.  So,  is he calling in or what?  Where is he?  Why are we doing this?  Who booked this?  Get Steve in here, please.  Steve!  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why are we doing this?  Because I'm gay.  I have nothing to say to this guy.  Where's Steve?  Steve! 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, walk.  It's radio.  It's fun.  What's up?  So, why are we doing this?  The, um...  I don't know.  Yeah.  Who booked this?  Where the fuck is the volume?  Is this you?  Yeah, okay.  There you go.  Yeah, you're on, stupid.  Go.  Um,  yeah, no, we, uh,  you agreed to this last week,  remember?  It was in that meeting we had?  I don't recall ever approving this.  You never do.  No.  Um, but, uh,  that, that doesn't,  that doesn't,  that, that, that,  that, that,  that, that,  is it what? 
[02:47:30]  Great improv.  Did you,  do you remember approving this?  When, when were we told about this?  I certainly do not.  Could you please hold still?  No, nothing.  What?  Nothing.  No, what?  Say it.  I don't have improv skills.  Yeah, you're right.  I don't have improv skills.  I'm not even good at playing myself.  I don't even have a plug sheet for this.  What, what is,  do we know what they're promoting?  Uh, you should have it right in front of you.  Really?  No, I don't see it.  Uh, I was looking at, uh, Anthony over there.  Hey, Steve,  why is Rick, uh, 
[02:48:00]  so late calling in?  I don't know.  I'm not the wrestling guy.  Maybe call in one of those, uh,  The wrestling guy is,  is the time guy now, huh?  Yeah, exactly.  Who, who booked this?  You know what?  Let me go find,  let me go find Sam,  the wrestling guy.  Who booked this?  Did Sam book it,  or did Steve?  Uh, I booked it.  Then what would Sam be answering?  Sam would know the wrestling end of this,  because he was the one who said  this would be a good idea.  Sam would know why he's calling in now, 
[02:48:30]  as opposed to a half hour ago?  No, Sam,  no, he wasn't supposed to call in a half hour ago.  Hmm.  Who said he was supposed to call in a half hour ago?  That's great,  so we're just gonna sit here.  What are we eating?  Yeah, Steve.  We've been doing a show since six,  so I'm hungry.  Gotta eat sometime.  I'm much braver now than I normally am.  So why are we doing this?  Believe me.  Believe you what?  We're sitting here,  we don't have a fucking guest.  I have no idea what I'm doing here.  Call StumpBrain,  see if he knows what's going on. 
[02:49:00]  No, he doesn't either.  Sorry.  Too busy drinking tea  and pitching fucking political people.  And booking guests!  What?  I'm sorry, what?  Ooh.  So this is great, Steve.  Good radio.  We're just gonna sit here.  I'm gonna eat.  Um, I don't know what Ant's gonna do.  Would you like me to call the publicist?  I could do that for you.  Why don't you do that?  Let's find out what's taking so long here.  Please stop yelling at me.  Can I please break character  and break somebody's fucking nose?  Just fucking play along.  I'm sensitive. 
[02:49:30]  I ruin things.  Yes, it does.  All right.  I wish I knew I'd acquit you.  He's a fag.  So what do we want to do here  while we're waiting for, um,  our guest to call in here?  Let's see what we got.  Baby eats crack cocaine at a party.  Mother gets probation,  turns her life around. 
[02:50:00]  Ah.  We can do that.  We can do, uh, John Clayton.  Ooh, this one's good.  John Clayton from ESPN farting on air.  Farting on the air.  That's always good.  Yes.  I'll put that in there.  Oh.  Do we have any, uh, backstory on this?  Who pulled this?  Uh, Danny.  I don't watch ESPN,  so I don't know who this guy is.  No?  Okay.  Well, let's just, uh,  see what flies here with that.  Does give him a chance to play.  I don't think he was close last week.  I think he'll be much closer this week. 
[02:50:30]  And Derek Anderson,  not exactly earning that $24 million extension of his.  Brady Quinn is lurking.  Where does it all stand in Cleveland?  Well, what they're going to do this week  is Brady's going to get more...  Ha ha!  I missed it.  Where was it?  Go back a little bit.  I heard it.  All right.  Hang on there.  Does give him a chance to play.  I don't think he was close last week.  I think he'll be much closer this week.  And Derek Anderson,  not exactly earning that $24 million extension of his.  Brady Quinn is lurking.  Where does it all stand in Cleveland?  Well, what they're going to do this week 
[02:51:00]  is Brady Quinn is going to get more staff.  That was, uh...  That was great.  Yes.  That would be a fart on the air.  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha!  Hope he, uh...  Do we have any idea, Rick?  Ha ha ha!  It's coming on now.  Wow, someone pays close attention.  Ha ha ha!  Fuck you, E-Rock.  I don't see it here.  That ain't E-Rock.  That's Opie.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I don't know why they're so mad at me.  Ha ha ha! 
[02:51:30]  See?  Great thing with Steve is  timing is everything.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Give this communique to Opie.  Steve!  Ha ha ha!  You got a communique?  Oh, I got a communique coming in.  Ha ha ha!  I'm dropping my curios.  What do we got?  Oh, okay.  So our guest was approved last week.  Mm-hmm.  Steve never confirmed it until 20 minutes ago, so they don't know where our guest is. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, Steve.  Steve.  That's not true at all.  Really?  They're scrambling to find him.  They don't know where he is.  They had no confirmation until 20 minutes ago from you.  I can't improv guest bookings.  He was confirmed yesterday, actually.  It was the person on the other hand who normally deals with the wrestler people.  But, Steve, didn't Opie and I say yes to this a week ago?  Yes, but the individuals who are on the other end were looking for a time.  We finally confirmed a time to do this yesterday. 
[02:52:30]  Mm-hmm.  So what do we do now, Steve?  Oh, I don't know.  Why don't I magically wave my hands and...  Do something?  Yes.  Try that.  Why don't you look at what's ringing right there?  Yeah.  Unknown.  Not on this screen.  What?  Oh, there we go.  Who's that?  Who's that?  Why's that?  Yeah.  30 minutes later.  Not only am I gay and incompetent, but I'm stupid.  All right.  Let's talk to our...  There we go. 
[02:53:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, professional wrestling legend, Ric Flair.  Ric.  Yes, Ric Flair.  How are you guys?  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you.  How are y'all doing?  Doing good.  So why are we talking to you today?  Why?  Because I'm coming to the Big Apple Tuesday, or Sunday, man, or Tuesday, Saturday.  Saturday.  And what are you doing?  I'm signing autographs.  Yes, of course.  That's Ringside Fest, which is at Caroline's on Broadway this Saturday. 
[02:53:30]  So you're going to be...  You're on the convention circuit now.  It's great to see Ann plugging away, as usual.  I am sometimes.  Only big cities like New York.  How do you feel meeting the fans at these conventions?  I enjoy it, actually.  I haven't done much of this in my entire career, so...  I mean, a lot of people think that it's not a cool thing to do, but sometimes, you know,  you've got to act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I don't look at it like that.  And I think that, you know, I enjoy the interaction. 
[02:54:00]  They're so respectful that it's just very rewarding.  Yeah.  I mean, the Star Trek guys, they've been doing these convention things forever, like, you  know, George Takai will be there.  I'm at a convention, marrying men.  You know, George Takai.  They're going to get me one lap through, and that'll be it.  So, I'm going to come through and have a good time, and enjoy the notoriety, and enjoy  the conversation, and then they won't see me for 10 more years. 
[02:54:30]  So, Rick, you're no longer with the WWE?  No.  I haven't watched wrestling in a while, so I'm being caught up on this here.  So, what happened?  Why are you gone now?  Well, I retired in March for wrestling.  And I could have stayed on and worked with them as kind of like an ambassador for the  company in a lot of different roles.  But they are so big, and they have so many, you know, commitments because of the size of 
[02:55:00]  the company, not only with wrestling, but they do so many charitable things, and they're  in the movie business, and the DVD business.  So, I just decided to take a shot at the 35 years of TV and try to do my own thing for  a while.  We left them very good terms, and I still talk to them all the time.  So, it wasn't like one of these phone conversations?  No.  Rick.  It was real nice.  This is Vince McMahon.  No.  Rick. 
[02:55:30]  You're fire.  No, no, no.  Very nice.  Very amicable.  You still get along with Vince?  Because most people, when they leave, don't get along with Vince anymore.  I think the world of my get along with him, great.  You want to do all of it, Vince?  You want to do all of it?  You're fire.  That's a pretty poor imitation, guys. 
[02:56:00]  Well, we never said we were stellar.  Yeah, but we had Mick Foley in not too long ago.  He's going to the TNA now.  TNA, yes.  Yeah.  I'm sad for him.  But he seems to have had a falling out with Vince.  A lot of yelling, a lot of screaming towards the end there.  I don't know.  I'm not privileged to know, but I think that he's got a great opportunity with TNA, but 
[02:56:30]  I don't think it would ever supersede the opportunity to work with WWE.  Did you ever think about moving on to TNA?  No.  Because you know who's over there at TNA doing the play-by-play is Don West.  I feel like, you know, limited edition Ric Flair and Mick Foley at a McGuire rookie card.  Yeah.  No, I've never...  Don West.  I have friends over there, and I respect the organization, but after you've been with  the WWE, there's not much left to do in wrestling.  I see. 
[02:57:00]  So who else is appearing at this...  Is it a convention?  Is it a forum?  Like, do the fans get to talk to you, or is it just photos?  What are they doing?  We do photos and autographs, and we interact with them, and I'll be honest with you, I  don't know who else is there.  I have a hard enough time keeping on my own schedule.  Have you been doing a lot of radio to promote this thing?  Actually, it's the first show.  Oh, really?  So you didn't get a chance to do...  You didn't get a chance to do Imus or anything like that?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  We got Ric Flair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:57:30]  Shut up.  Yeah, yeah.  You jerk.  Huh?  No, that's...  That would just...  That's Don Imus.  That's the type of radio he does.  Rick.  I don't listen to Imus.  Who does?  Um, Rick.  Yeah.  I gotta ask you, since you're now...  Is this a permanent retirement?  Is it one of those fake retirement things where you show up in six months and save Shawn  Michaels or something, or...  No.  I'm retired for good.  Very legitimate.  A lot of, um...  I guess you'd call them wrestling superstars. 
[02:58:00]  Mm-hmm.  Don't really, um, pan out too well after their days of wrestling.  Mm-hmm.  Um, I know he's not a favorite of yours.  Hulk Hogan.  Reality show.  His life's a mess now.  I don't know Hulk a lot.  Oh, you do?  That's it.  That's just TV guys.  I like him a lot.  I respect him.  Do you ever wish...  We're not best friends by any means, but I respect him.  Okay.  So, him moving on, doing the reality kind of thing, trying to do more than, uh, than,  uh, what he was capable in the world of wrestling, uh, Poe, get my truck.  How do you feel, um, you know, how do you feel like the TV show has, is that the downfall 
[02:58:30]  for his family?  Is this something that, uh, not just wrestlers, but celebrities in general should stay away  from the reality show?  I hope not, because I'm shooting a pilot for mine tomorrow.  You have a reality show.  What's it going to consist of?  Can't tell you guys, see?  Ah, secret.  We're talking about Saturdays.  I can't give you guys too much information.  Is it involving the family?  Mm-hmm.  How's that going these days?  Great.  Got four beautiful kids, three grandchildren, three ex-wives, and a beautiful new girlfriend. 
[02:59:00]  Uh-huh.  How do the kids, uh, feel about, uh, step-parents?  Obviously, that's something that comes up, uh...  Um, that can be, that can be, uh, difficult at times, but I think that everybody is open-minded  to, um, what's going on, and everybody has a rational outlook and feels like they're in  a good place.  It always works out.  I was, uh, lucky enough.  I love my stepfather.  He was...  Ro!  Ro!  It's Sal! 
[02:59:30]  I'm on the phone with Ric Flair, Ro!  That's what my...  I mean, he's such a character.  Where is Sal from?  Baltimore!  But he lives on Long Island now.  Long Island!  You ever been down to Baltimore?  Those accents are the worst.  Baltimore?  Yeah.  Ro!  I've been there many times.  Ro!  Ro!  Ric Flair is talking to me, Ro!  That's, uh...  Sal.  Good friend of ours.  Anthony's stepfather.  Yeah.  Brett Hart was in Not Too Long Ago.  You have a chance to read his book? 
[03:00:00]  No.  No.  Things, uh, still not settled between you and, uh, and Brett?  There's nothing to settle.  Well, wasn't there some heat a while back about, uh, you thought Brett was, um, cashing  in on his brother's death?  No, I didn't say cashing in on it.  I merely said that I thought that the death, the tragedy of his brother's death was much  bigger than anything that ever happened in Montreal, and the two things seemed to clash,  and, you know, I'm not afraid to say what I think.  Good. 
[03:00:30]  Um...  That's not something personal to me.  I just express an opinion.  And I, every time we heard...  It was a terrible, terrible thing that happened, but it was nobody's fault, and it was, you  know, things happen in life that are terrible, but that's what it is.  Nothing more.  There's nothing to be talked about besides the tragedy.  That was my feeling.  Well, good.  Yeah, I haven't read the book either, uh...  They gave us a copy.  I was supposed to, but it's... 
[03:01:00]  I'm fired, Brett Hart!  Ah, Vince!  You don't work for me anymore because he's fired!  Oh, yeah!  They're gonna have a fire!  Rick, you, uh, we have a bunch of fans checking here.  You want to talk to some of the listeners?  Um, yeah.  Okay.  Uh, let's go to, uh, this line here.  Roland!  Roland, you're on the Opie and Anthony show with Rick Flair!  Wow, Rick, it's an honor to talk to you, sir.  I'm a bit sad.  Did you hear that pro wrestler Esty Jones died last night in the West Indies? 
[03:01:30]  I thought so.  Uh, hey, Opie.  All right.  I'm up on Rick.  Aw, too bad.  This was going so great.  What happened?  Are we gonna get him back on the phone again?  I don't know.  I guess he...  I didn't hit the whole button.  What?  I'm up on Rick.  See, Opie, uh, if you want to take two calls at the same time, this is a different bank  for you.  Yeah, I realize that. 
[03:02:00]  Now, maybe Roland could call back, Opie.  Because, um, he didn't hear that, uh, Roland's good call.  Maybe if we get Rick back on the phone, Roland could call again.  I think they're working on it right now.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wow, Opie.  I figured as long as you've been in the business, you know how to work a phone bank.  Well, you know, these things happen.  All right.  Where are we with Rick? 
[03:02:30]  I don't know.  Uh.  Sandwiches.  They got him.  Is that E-Rock?  This is going great.  All right, they're getting him back on the phone.  And that should be Rick.  Rick!  Rick?  Hello?  Sorry about that.  We got disconnected.  I hit the wrong thing on the phone here.  It's okay. 
[03:03:00]  Thanks, Opie.  I really love you.  All right.  Well, do you want to, uh, let's give the plug for, uh, Rick's stupid thing that he needs  money for.  Sandwiches.  Not sandwiches.  Where's he doing a signing?  Oh, usually you plug, but I'll go ahead and do it.  You have the sheet.  I don't have a sheet in front of me here.  Ringside Fest.  Caroline's on Broadway this Saturday and meet Ric Flair.  Is this on? 
[03:03:30]  What time?  Uh, I think it's, uh, starts like at 10.  I don't know.  Woo!  Yeah, about 10 a.m.  I can't.  I don't know.  Yeah, they're doing a convention there.  Great.  Is this on?  So, uh, all right.  I don't know.  Thanks to Ric Flair for calling in.  I don't know.  Go see him.  He needs help.  I bring nothing to the table.  Yes, that is true.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back with more of the Opie Nights show.  I don't know. 
[03:04:00]  I'm telling you, we're on to something.  We're going to franchise this show out.  Yeah, they're actually better.  And we don't even have to show up anymore, man.  Yeah, they're better.  The interview is better.  More sustained questions.  More prepared.  Better impressions.  Nothing beats Sam's impressions.  Most of the fast food guys are long.  Quieter eating.  Quieter eating.  Most of the fast food giants are long gone, but, you know, we still enjoy their food, right?  Yes.  We're franchising this show.  We get paid for our names, and we don't have to come in anymore. 
[03:04:30]  Fucking E-Rock is going to get a beating after the show.  Why?  For doing an exact impression of Opie?  When he started taking the spoon and scraping it on the side of the yogurt cup right into  the mic as Ric Flair was talking.  It was just great.  The little, that's great, Steve.  We'll just sit here.  Yeah.  Hitting the table.  We'll just sit here.  All right.  Whatever.  It's good radio.  Yeah.  And then the Sam impression of Vince through the bullhorn was fantastic.  I thought Vince was on the phone. 
[03:05:00]  When he goes, guys, that's not really that good of an impression.  I was just like, no.  What do you say?  What do we try?  Literal Rick?  Yeah.  You have no idea how good it is, my friend.  No idea.  You're out getting kudos.  Stellar as Opie.  Yeah.  No, both, man.  Sam fucking just throwing in the impressions.  Yeah.  The Don West impression was great.  Because then you stopped doing the impression and then had to go, Don West. 
[03:05:30]  Say the name.  We've always said if you have to say the name, wow, there's trouble.  Well, Damone, too.  Yeah, the Damone one.  What Damone line you do, again?  You got to act like wherever you are.  That's the place to be.  We don't get to hear from Coke Logic often.  Coke Logic.  Good evening.  Good evening.  I have to say how fucking brilliant E-Rock is at doing Opie.  I mean, if I had to impersonate you, I would know the broad strokes of your personality, 
[03:06:00]  but he's got you down to a science.  Oh, E-Rock has had it with me.  Oh, he's looked at the films.  He's had it.  He really has.  He's had it.  Oh, yeah.  He's had it.  You could tell just by the way he sat there.  He's sitting back in the chair, just tapping his fingers, yelling at people.  If we ever make a movie, he could play me, as long as he loses 50, 60 pounds.  I don't want a fat version of me on the big screen.  Oh, shit.  With the fucking, who approved this?  Asking the kid, did you approve it? 
[03:06:30]  He never would have done this.  E-Rock's a star today.  He took the fucking candle wax shots today.  Yep.  Nice.  All right, Coke.  Thank you, sir.  Nice heel.  So that's what we like to call franchising, and we got to keep it under our hat so we can  do a few more of those.  But I'm telling you, eventually that's what we do.  We hire some Opie Anthony's and Jim Norton's, and we go out to the mailbox, go out to the  mailbox, collect our checks.  That's right.  Keep it under our hats. 
[03:07:00]  Like George Harrison did with the pudding.  Keep it under your hats, mate.  Some of yours is leaking out, sir.  They didn't do any George Harrison jokes.  I was very surprised.  Next time.  Sarah Palin.  We got a fine little story about Sarah.  All right.  Why would this work? 
[03:07:30]  See, now I don't want to do it.  Now you're all self-conscious being your seller.  Of course.  Sarah Palin.  Well, we got a couple.  A gay couple in California.  Ooh.  Hanging a mannequin.  When the hell did this happen?  Dressed as Sarah Palin.  Hanging her by a noose.  Is this for a Halloween thingy?  Yeah.  That they hung a Sarah Palin little dummy? 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  I'm distracted because we have a part two to this thing, and I don't know if it's going  to hit today.  We'll see.  All right.  And they hung her, I guess?  Hung that dummy?  Yeah.  Let's listen to the story.  It certainly catches your attention.  A mannequin dressed as vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  Hanging from a noose.  Her running mate, John McCain, coming out of a burning chimney.  To Chad Michael Morissette and his partner Mito, it's all in good Halloween fun.  It should be seen as art, and it should be seen as within the month of October. 
[03:08:30]  It is Halloween.  It's time to be scary.  It's time to be spooky.  Why are they making a big deal of this?  It's not a big deal.  Gays should hate her.  It's a woman.  Icky.  Hang it.  Exactly.  They put a bunch of ghosts booing her cunt.  They certainly must not like that.  They put shark's teeth in the vagina.  They don't know what it looks like.  Yeah.  Dangerous.  Put a cock on it.  Yeah.  Under construction. 
[03:09:00]  It just seems to me that if a neighbor that was a Republican decided to do the same  thing, there would be major outrage if perhaps you took an effigy of Obama and decided to  hang that in a tree, there would be a problem.  Well, the couple explains that.  All right.  They acknowledge.  Let's listen in.  They acknowledge that they're pussies.  That they suck cocks.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  But not all West Hollywood residents see it that way.  This man says, imagine the outrage if someone hung a mannequin depicting Barack Obama. 
[03:09:30]  That's me.  Whether I'm Republican or Democrat, it's not about that.  It's about this and a noose, and it's just wrong.  Oh, I know if we had done it with Barack Obama, people would have probably thrown things  through our windows.  And, I mean, the image of a hanged black man is a lot more intense than the image of a  They like hung black men.  Of course they do.  For our country and the history of our country.  How old are you calling the bulls?  We have to prep.  Yeah.  See?  That guy.  A lot of who gives a shit attention. 
[03:10:00]  Whatever.  Grown up butthead.  Yeah.  That gave the comment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all but this hanging.  I think if you're a Democrat or Republican.  Bill Kay, right?  Hey, Ope.  Ask Jimmy about the interview he did with the TV guy channel with that fat, homely woman.  Do you remember this?  It's online.  And the woman is horrible, the typical cheery fat lady.  She was nice.  I mean, uh.  Did you fuck her?  No!  That would be unprofessional.  Oh, okay. 
[03:10:30]  And we sat down.  She's, uh.  Oh, but.  She was very nice off the air, too.  Ted, the poster from Whackbag.  Like, yep, when fags commit a hate crime, it's art.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It really is.  It would have happened.  It really is.  It's all you have to do is say it's art and you get away with it, right?  Mapplethorpe is art, but Dice wasn't.  It's the way they fucking look at it. 
[03:11:00]  Why isn't it now?  Why isn't it now the National Organization of Women for Women?  Right.  Why aren't they complaining?  Right.  Exactly.  Oh my God.  You know how you hold up signs at wrestling events and stuff?  Yeah.  There's a sign behind Sarah Palin right now.  She's talking live on all the channels.  Uh-huh.  It just says, Mac is back.  Mac is back.  Yeah.  But it looks like fuck, because I can only see the C and the K, and I automatically think  fuck.  Mac is fuck.  Oh yeah, it looks like fucker in the back.  Fucker in the back. 
[03:11:30]  And she's pointing back to the sign, country first.  What a shitty sign.  These are the worst signs at a rally ever.  Mac is back.  Mac is back.  They're just, it's going to be, it's going to take some kind of, um, miracle, or some  kind of weird twist of the, um, Illuminati or the people that run things.  No, the Illuminati.  They have to rig the fucking voting machines somehow.  Yeah, exactly.  The Illuminati want a Democrat in there.  Uh, do they? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, because it's tough times right now.  Tough times.  What do you think, what do you think will happen if all the polls are showing that Obama's  got this thing and he's going to win it, blah, blah, blah, and then, uh, the next morning  everyone wakes up and John McCain is president of the United States.  Do you foresee?  We don't leave our house that day.  A problem.  Do you foresee a problem?  I do, yeah.  Because right now everyone's expecting it, uh, uh, uh, the, the black, uh, society, society  in this country is completely expecting to have Barack Obama as president. 
[03:12:30]  So if something happens and he's not, could be a problem akin to a Rodney King beating  problem.  Especially because of the candidates, it's not a good ticket.  It's not like, it's not like Obama will be losing to like a Ronald Reagan fucking George  Bush senior ticket.  That was unbeatable.  Yes.  Now I can't do any imitation of anybody without thinking how Sam would do it. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Ronald Reagan, you got to say the name at this point, we got to give it to Obama.  What do you mean?  Well, because I'll like literally give it to him.  I thought you meant you got to give it to him for what?  You got to give it to him because you know, whitey in general scared of black folk and you  know, like your scenario plays out, it's going to be really scary.  So at this point, just give it to him.  I think, uh, I just don't punch me in the teeth.  I would see Watts kind of getting a little crazy, perhaps South Central.  Um, uh, East coasters don't like to ride like they used to Midwest. 
[03:13:30]  You get Chicago, Detroit would be, uh, in flames.  Yeah.  But it's cold in the day.  So it doesn't matter.  It might, uh, if fires are warm it up, that'd be a problem down South.  We could have some problems in, uh, um, New Orleans, Houston.  Sarah Palin, everything is possible in America.  Isn't it?  At least she has an original quote.  Everything is possible.  No, it's not.  All right.  You can't have five smart kids. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, snap.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  Not everything's possible in America.  Try to hunt for your own food in a big city.  Oh, no, not in a big city.  Right.  A good one, Jimmy?  Oh, it smells like an armpit.  Oh, jeez.  That's a raw gasser.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  I think, uh, we're going to do line of the day because, um, part two of what we want  to do isn't happening.  Yeah, no, he ain't going to call. 
[03:14:30]  But he's, he's not.  Steve.  I want to reset.  See, I can't even do the show anymore because he's an asshole.  Oh, Jimmy.  I knew it would hit me eventually.  I told you.  I moseyed on over there.  Holy shit.  I sent it over there quietly with a message.  Steve, are we, you know, doing what, what, you got an answer or don't say anything?  We're speaking in code.  Yeah.  Sort of.  Possible, but unlikely.  Why?  Uh.  He was mad at the questioning? 
[03:15:00]  I think so.  I think so.  And he thinks he got hung up on.  So.  The first time?  Yeah.  What does he think?  It's a fucking work we're doing here.  Oh, it was.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we were fucking with him.  Waiting from.  We're all upset.  Wow.  Someone who fucks with his, with the audience for.  You know, a living is mad because we may have fucked with him.  Yeah.  Woo.  Get that woo woo on the phone.  What?  Get, what's wrong?  That, like, that, that waft of Jimmy's gas just hit me in the face as I walked in that 
[03:15:30]  direction.  It's so bad.  It is putrid.  Your colon.  You're used to stuff from the other side hitting me in the face.  That would imply that I'm gay, which I'm not.  Yes.  Yes.  Jimmy, that's awful.  Really?  People are asking for the other Opie and Anthony to come back on the show.  Yeah, they want them back.  Good.  Bring them back.  I'll go home.  I found them easier to deal with.  Why don't we at least start line of the day and then we'll figure out where we're going 
[03:16:00]  to go with this thing.  All right?  Goody good.  I want to re-sign.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have to.  But it's not a holdout, believe me.  Not a holdout.  Oh, I know.  Not even close.  What's going on, Jimmy?  It's just so many fucking shenanigans.  Can't discuss some shenanigans in progress.  About what?  Everything is so irritating.  It really is.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah.  A thing or two.  I know a thing or two about a thing or two. 
[03:16:30]  You can call me what you want.  Just don't call me late for supper.  Supper.  Sorry.  That awful delivery.  For a bad joke.  Line of the day is brought to you by WebEx.com.  Hold meetings.  Make presentations.  Do it from the comfort of your own home or office.  Check it out at WebEx.com.  We'll start doing some of these right now.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  What's all those Chinese dishes?  We got beef and baccalini. 
[03:17:00]  General Chow.  General Chow's yak.  Sarah Palin.  We will drill and we will drill now.  Yeah.  When?  Give me a timeline.  I've had enough of this bitch.  Like right now.  What McCain and I believe in is what Ronald Reagan believed in.  Wow, they're doing that now, huh? 
[03:17:30]  I showed 30 years ago.  It's good.  All right.  Fuck her.  Why don't we do another line of the day of the runner-up variety?  Can we do retard of the day?  Mongoloid of the day.  Please, let's do it.  Can we start?  We'll start with E-Rock just to keep it fair.  Why are retards such victims of this show?  Because they're easy.  They're easy target.  That's all so funny.  Stop shaking your Mac is back sign.  Exactly.  Fucking, but what is it? 
[03:18:00]  She's an old bag.  Is that who's on that?  The old bag?  Michael J. Fox was a supporter.  He doesn't mean to shake it.  We need American energy resources.  No shit.  Mm-hmm.  And?  But what are you going to, how are you going to do that and when?  Drill, drill, drill.  The whole state's going to be Swiss cheese.  All right, fine.  When?  Look at that old bat behind her with that sign shaking it.  Country first.  Mac is back.  I bet you she didn't even make that sign.  Of course she didn't.  It's a professionally made and they said, all right, you're in the front row.  Hold this up, stupid. 
[03:18:30]  Oh.  God.  It's sexy if a girl's blowing you if you say, why don't you chew on my sack for a few?  Yeah, that's good.  The best of America is in everyday, hardworking Americans.  Okay.  These fake fucking lines they just throw out that don't mean shit.  Rah, rah, rah.  Blah, blah, blah.  It's all bullshit.  If you're ready to win the war, we need your vote.  All right.  What?  These are like. 
[03:19:00]  What?  Are they?  How?  Are they going to drop an atomic bomb?  Right.  Give us.  How?  Do something.  Say how.  You ready to win the war?  Vote for us.  Why?  What will you do?  We're going to nuke the whole fucking place.  Oh, okay.  That'll win.  They're getting their slogans from those little heart candies.  Yeah.  You can do it.  Right.  If you're ready to win the war, we need your vote.  Okay.  Here's Mac.  Mac is back.  Mac is back.  Mac has to say.  Mac is the hag.  Wow.  What an ovation.  I got to say, Obama's got the hot chicks.  And McCain's got old fucking bags. 
[03:19:30]  June Allison.  Who's the lady with the hat in the back?  Thank you.  That's that old bat.  You're a burn victim.  Isn't this just going to be a marvelous vice president of the United States?  How long does it take before he says friends?  My friends.  All of you smell like piss.  Marvelous.  Asshole.  You know, I couldn't be more pleased because of your enthusiasm for her.  But I guarantee you there's only one place in America they're not going to be enthusiastic.  And that's the old boy network in Washington, D.C. 
[03:20:00]  When I bring her there, and we're going to clean it up.  And we're going to fix it.  And she's going to show them what reform is all about the same way she did in the state of Alaska.  Pick up an apple.  Oh, there's the my friends.  My friends.  My friends.  You're not my friends.  By the way, when two Mavericks join up, we don't agree on everything.  But that's a lot of fun.  You're not Mavericks.  Maverick.  And also, could I mention.  He's Goose after he ejected. 
[03:20:30]  One of those races, the last 250 miles, he broke his arm and finished the race.  You think he's afraid of anything in Washington, D.C.?  Washington.  Washington.  Washington.  I like McCain as a guy, but he's doing nothing for me.  Could I again thank Cindy McCain, a wonderful mother, and the future first lady of the United States.  Future first lady?  Really?  Is she marrying Obama?  Yeah.  We want a vice president that bleeds from the cunt. 
[03:21:00]  I'd like to say a word of gratitude and thank you for Tom Ridge, who is the best governor of this state.  I'm just waiting to find out who's sick this time around.  Who's in the hospital.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers.  A friend and comrade who served this nation in war and in peace.  So, my friends, it's wonderful to be back in Pennsylvania, and it's wonderful to fool the pundits,  because we're going to win the state of Pennsylvania, my friends.  Oh, yeah.  My friends.  We're going to win it on November 4th.  My friends.  You're going to get out the vote, and we're going to win.  The darkest thing we need in Hershey, Pennsylvania is the chocolate. 
[03:21:30]  He just really gets racist on him.  Yeah.  That'd be fantastic.  You've seen what they do in D.C.  Do you want one in the White House?  Last-ditch effort.  Yeah.  Blatant racism.  He's down 48 shakes to two.  And we have to fight for it.  I've been fighting for this country since I was 17 years old.  We remember.  I've got the scars to prove it.  Uh-oh.  He's bringing up the scars a lot to prove it.  My friends.  Show him.  What has he done? 
[03:22:00]  Besides enjoy grape soda.  Listen, sir, and I will spike to shake up Washington and take America to New Jersey from my first  day in office until my last.  Which is three days later.  Exactly.  And that fucking uptight cunt is running the country.  That's right.  You're going to have that hot box running the whole corporation.  We have a plan to hold the line on taxes.  Cut them to make America more competitive.  Create jobs here at home.  Shut up.  We're going to double the child deduction for working. 
[03:22:30]  Child deduction?  Double child deduction?  I bet I know who's voting for him.  Go John.  Uncle Paul.  I like this guy.  Those Amber alerts.  What the fuck?  They should telltales.  He's describing the perfect society.  Society.  That's a lesson of history.  Exactly.  Why is fucking Father Mulcahy standing behind him in the red?  Keep the money in your hands and strengthens our economy.  She is a wreck. 
[03:23:00]  If I'm a hundred president, I won't spend nearly a trillion dollars more of your money.  Senator Obama will.  My friends.  My friends.  Oh, boo.  Boo.  And he can't do that without raising your taxes or digging us further into debt.  Boo.  I'm going to make government live on a budget just like you do.  Oh, yay.  All right.  Hooray.  Yeah.  Let's guess the yays and the boos.  Yay.  Look at him.  Get smiling.  We'll freeze government spending and of course we can freeze government spending. 
[03:23:30]  Brr.  We'll freeze it on all but the most important programs like defense, veterans care, social  security and health care until we scrub every single government program.  Yeah.  Get rid of the ones that aren't working for the American people and I'll veto every single  pork barrel bill that comes apart.  I guess you will know that.  No more pork.  I like pork barrels.  You will know their names and we'll make them great.  Big pork barrel.  Yes.  We call them E-Rock. 
[03:24:00]  People don't get it.  They're like, you've never done this to Obama.  No more pork.  That's right.  Anthony's a huge McCain supporter.  He knows when to have a little fun.  Shut you yet, you fucking cunt.  That's right.  Yeah.  It's a huge McCain guy and he's having fun with this whole fucking thing.  I'm not going to spend $750 billion dollars of your money just daily.  When are you going to figure that out?  I hate Obama, dummies.  Raising taxes makes a bad economy much worse.  Yep.  Another one from the little heart candies.  Yeah.  The excesses, greed, and corruption of Wall Street and Washington. 
[03:24:30]  Washington.  I have a plan in Washington.  It shouldn't be allowed to be president if you can't say Washington.  Where is he from?  I don't know.  Washington.  Somewhere they say Washington.  Go out and buy up these bad things.  Get rid of all the bad mortgages.  Give them a mortgage they can afford.  And stay with the American dream of owning your own home.  Right.  What?  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Get rid of all the bad mortgages.  People stay in their homes.  How the fuck are you going to do that?  It was the housing crisis that started this. 
[03:25:00]  And it's the housing values coming back up that are going to get us out.  Is it?  My friends.  We're going to stop.  My friends.  We're going to stop, if I'm elected president, spending $700 billion, sending it overseas  to countries that don't like us very much to buy their oil.  We're going to stop it.  You mean the world?  I like that.  Sarah said.  Sarah.  I do like that.  Sarah said.  Let's see what Sarah said.  My friends.  My friends.  The other night in a debate, I paid great appreciation to Senator Obama's eloquence. 
[03:25:30]  But you've got to pay attention to his words.  You know, when we talked about offshore drilling, he said he liked it.  You've got to pay attention to his skit.  Oh, his words.  And he said, I will consider offshore drilling.  We don't need to consider.  We need to drill now.  Drill.  Drill.  Drill.  Drill.  Drill.  Drill. 
[03:26:00]  Nuclear.  He says that he's, quote, for nuclear power, but he doesn't want to store and he  doesn't want to reprospent nuclear fuel.  You can't get there from here.  I tell Senator Obama, the fact is, the fact is we've been sailing Navy ships around the  world with nuclear power on them and it's safe and we can reprocess and we can store  and we can create 700,000 new jobs.  Yeah.  That's right. 
[03:26:30]  That's right.  That's right.  Hospital workers.  And wig makers.  Wig makers.  We'll feed the poor with coal.  We'll feed the poor with coal. 
[03:27:00]  We'll feed them coal.  If they can't afford bread, let them eat coal.  We've got coal.  What?  We've got coal.  We've got coal.  We've got coal.  You've got coal.  That's right.  Wow.  That's a bad chance.  We've got coal.  That's why he has started the chance.  No, they were saying we've got coal.  They need basic.  We've learned more about Senator Obama's real goals for our country over the last two weeks 
[03:27:30]  and we learned over the past two years.  Washington, take one drink.  My friends, take two drinks.  Pork barrel.  Shotgun and beer.  He's talking about Joe the Plumber.  Oh, Joe the Plumber time?  My back is just 15.  That's when Senator Obama revealed he wants to, quote, spread the wealth around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Ooh.  My friends.  And now more and more coming to light that he's wanted to spread the wealth around for  a long time, my friends. 
[03:28:00]  My friends.  Ooh.  Now, Joe didn't ask.  No.  Joe didn't ask for Senator Obama to come to his house.  And he didn't ask to be famous.  He certainly didn't ask for the political attacks on him from the Obama campaign.  Right.  Yeah.  Boo.  Boo.  Ah, fuck Joe.  Joe's dream is every American's dream.  To own a small business that will create jobs and the attacks on him are an attack on  small businesses all over this nation.  And I will not stand by while you badmouth the United States of America. 
[03:28:30]  That's right.  Small businesses employ 81% of Americans.  Did he have Sam do that?  We need to support small businesses, not tax them.  Fucking Sam.  What a wise ass.  Fucking asshole.  Two months of campaign trail eloquent.  We finally learned what Senator Obama's economic goal is.  Yeah.  Spread the wealth.  In a radio interview.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  With Hopi and Anthony.  He said the same thing.  That one of the, quote, tragedies of civil rights movement.  Is that it didn't bring about redistributive change. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  That's right.  Can you imagine?  Fuck that.  You see, Senator Obama believes in redistributing wealth.  Uh-oh.  Not in policies that grow our economy and create jobs.  Right.  He said that even, even though lower taxes...  Are you serious now?  Oh, that's what I said.  Don't get serious now.  Hey, every so often he says stuff that...  We're keeping it fun, though, right now.  What?  Keeping it fun.  Fairness.  Can I talk about a stretch Armstrong neck?  Yes.  You ever twist a stretch Armstrong? 
[03:29:30]  It looks just like his neck.  We all suffer when that happens.  And he turns to the side, especially.  Yeah.  That's the problem with Senator Obama's approach to our economy.  He's more interested in controlling wealth than creating wealth.  Than have that wire in the middle.  Yeah.  Fuck.  See?  What?  In redistributing money instead of spreading opportunity.  I'm going to create wealth for all Americans.  By creating opportunity for all Americans.  Wealth for everyone?  How?  You're going to be millionaires?  Everybody. 
[03:30:00]  But that's socialism, too.  Everybody!  That's right.  Senator Obama is running to be...  Create wealth, but don't spend it.  I'm running to be commander in...  Got little shoes.  Attacks you, but only the rich.  You can't make everyone rich.  Then you're not rich.  No.  Then everyone's on the same level, isn't it?  And then...  Candy bars cost 40,000.  Lifts for all Americans' shoes.  And wigs!  That's right.  The Amelia Lester has variety.  I'm running to make everyone successful. 
[03:30:30]  That's impossible!  I'm 58, yet I wear a wig, belongs in Kaju Kuzu.  He made a lot of promises.  First, he said people making less than $250,000 would benefit from his plan.  This weekend, we announced in an ad that if your family making less than $200,000, you'll benefit.  But yesterday, right here in Pennsylvania, Senator Biden said tax relief should only go to middle-class people. 
[03:31:00]  People making under $150,000 a year.  You're getting an idea of what's on their mind.  Yes, we are.  Taking over the country.  A little sneak peek.  Yes, we are.  It's interesting how their definition of rich has a way of creeping down.  He likes up-can shots.  At this rate, it won't be long before Senator Obama is right back to his vote.  But America's making just $42,000 a year should get a tax increase.  We can't let that happen.  We won't let that happen. 
[03:31:30]  Boo.  Boo.  America's $10,000 a year should get an increase.  My opponent's massive new tax increase is exactly the wrong approach in an economic world.  The answer to a slowing economy isn't higher taxes.  Prostitution.  That's exactly what's going to happen when the Democrats have total control of Washington.  We can't let that happen.  We need a pro-growth, pro-jobs, economic policies.  All right, wrap up, Washington.  Wrap up.  He's saying that we should prosecute small businesses, not tax them. 
[03:32:00]  Let's wrap up.  Let's wrap up.  Government spending programs paid for with higher taxes.  Drug dealers are small businesses.  They should prosper.  I feel like I'm at Caroline's and they give the comedian the red light and it's like another  10, 15 minutes.  Wrap up.  Taxes have been too low.  I think that spending has been too high.  Well, everyone does.  Yeah, well, I'm done with him.  All these things are just little soundbites.  Trying to make soundbites for the news.  Washington.  Washington. 
[03:32:30]  No.  Where is Washington?  I don't know.  Won't have time to get used to the office.  We face many challenges here at home.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, broad.  In this dangerous world.  And my friends.  My friends.  I will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.  Uh-oh.  Peace with honor.  Sounds familiar.  Yeah.  Peace with honor.  Tricky Dick's used that one.  Oh, he's winking now.  How are you going to do that, John?  It looks like it hurts when he tries to wink.  You ever heard?  It hurts doing anything.  You ever heard the word victory passed through Obama's lips? 
[03:33:00]  The victory passed through Obama's lips.  And the, what was it?  The color?  Yeah.  My friends.  Color boy?  Yeah.  We're winning in Iraq.  Yeah, I heard that one, Judd.  That's a doozy.  Young Americans who are serving will want to win.  Well, color boy, why are you motherfuckers?  The other day, Senator Biden warned that in his words, he said, mark my words.  Mark my words.  Senator Obama would be tested with an international crisis.  Oh, yep.  My friends, I've been tested. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah?  Senator Obama.  And I got caught.  You got caught.  Ow.  I've been tested.  And I got kids.  And I have AIDS.  I'm a size queen who spends his time in glory.  Oh, my friends.  I love cock.  I can't get enough.  Oh, you've been listening to the John McCain.  I only joined the military to see all those cocks like a Biloxi Blue.  You've been listening to John McCain lose his mind.  It goes old school.  I know how cock it is.  Yeah.  My friends, I am a size queen. 
[03:34:00]  That needs to be tested.  All right.  Are we, uh, should we fade out?  I like his foreign policy talks here.  Then we'll, uh, you know.  We already know that Senator Obama won't have the right response to that test because we've  seen the wrong response from him over and over during this campaign.  Yes.  He opposed the surge strategy that's bringing us victory in Iraq and will bring us victory  in Afghanistan.  Mm-hmm.  He said he would sit down unconditionally with the world's worst dictators. 
[03:34:30]  Mm-hmm.  When Russia, when Russia, when Obama said the invaded country should show restraint, he's been wrong  on all of these.  When I'm president of the United States, we're going to win in Iraq, win in Afghanistan.  Our troops will come home and our troops will come home and you will be proud and they will  be proud.  All right.  Thank you.  Wall sheet, man.  Thanks for filling us in.  My friends.  My friends. 
[03:35:00]  Now, my friends, let me give you the state of the race today.  There's one week to go.  State of the race.  One white guy.  One black guy.  The pundits have to vote us off as they have several times before.  Ah, yeah.  Our opponent is out working out the details with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid on their  plans.  Boo!  Raise your taxes.  Yes.  Raise your taxes.  Increase spending and concede defeat.  This is like when The Rock used to come out for a wrestling match.  Yeah.  Get the boos and the yeas.  Boo. 
[03:35:30]  Before the election.  By the way, no one will delay the World Series game with an infomercial when I'm president.  Whoa!  Well, now you're talking bullshit.  Look, he's having a little fun now.  He's smiling.  Drop the n-bomb.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine?  It'd be the best clip ever.  Because I'm all patient about these things, I prefer to let the voters weigh in before presuming  the outcome. 
[03:36:00]  He's said all this stuff already.  Of course he has.  He's just doing the same speech over and over.  He's trying to get to 11.  What America needs now is someone who will finish the race before starting the big election.  It's free advertising.  You stay on there as long as you can.  Someone will fight to the end.  Not for himself, but for his country.  Yeah.  I have fought for you most of my life.  I know.  And I bow to you for that, sir.  I wish you were there when Boomer beat me up.  He didn't fight for me there.  If I had John McCain there, slugging out with him, he would have hated you, actually. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, he would have.  He would have hated him.  He loved Boomer and hated me.  I looked faggy.  I was crying.  Of course.  Now, my friends.  Come here, crybaby.  I know you're worried.  Yes, we are.  America is a great country.  We're in a moment of national crisis that will determine our future.  I want to ask you.  What happened?  Uh-oh.  Will we continue to lead the world's economies or will we be overtaken?  Oh, God.  This is a big line.  Will our military remain the strongest in the world? 
[03:37:00]  Will our children and grandchildren's future be brighter than ours?  My answer to you is yes.  Yes, we will.  Imagine if he said no.  Oh, God.  Like last time.  I say no.  What?  But I meant no to you.  No, I mean yes to...  Yes.  I meant no to integration.  Yes to Hosey.  He unraveled.  I'm an American and I choose to fight.  Don't give up hope.  Be strong.  Have courage and fight. 
[03:37:30]  This is the end.  Fight for a new direction for our country.  Fight for what's right for America.  Fight for white.  Fight for white.  Clean up the mess of corruption.  Inviting.  Selfishness in America.  Fight to get our economy out of the ditch and back in the league.  Out of the shithole.  The ideals and character of a free people.  That old cunt is waving the sign too high to be seen on the camera.  Fight for justice.  Fight to send them all back.  Wait a minute.  Watch me.  What did he say?  Stand up.  Look at her waving the sign too high. 
[03:38:00]  Fight.  Fuck.  I gotta stand up.  I'm with it.  I'm up.  I'm up.  I'm up.  We never give up.  We never quit.  We make history.  Never give up.  Never surrender.  Now let's go win this election and get this country moving again.  Thank you.  All right.  Look at Palin cheering.  There he goes.  John McCain, ladies and gentlemen, with a very raucous speech, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, look at the cuckold.  Very important state for him. 
[03:38:30]  Hershey, Pennsylvania.  He's in Pennsylvania.  I'm Heidi Collins.  We'll see you back here tomorrow morning.  Guys, right till 11.  Wow.  Who's the guy?  Is that her husband in front of him?  That's the cuckold.  That is Sarah Palin's husband.  Is he prepping the bull?  He's going to have to prep McCain.  It's a guy in an Obama mask.  Really?  I didn't see what you were talking about.  There's that wife of his.  Wow.  Where were we?  Burst of energy at the end there, at the end of the speech from John McCain here in Pennsylvania.  That was good. 
[03:39:00]  Very important state for the Republicans and John McCain.  Anthony.  Win.  Because you're the big McCain guy.  Could you explain to these dummies out there?  Don't knock on McCain.  He's a hell of a lot better choice than Obama.  Do you listen to the show, idiots?  Yes.  Anthony decided also to just step out of his role.  And just fucking mock the whole goddamn thing.  I hate Obama.  I'm voting for McCain.  Well, I'm not.  I'm making fun of it because why am I going to sit here and watch sound bites and stupid 
[03:39:30]  things and things he said already and watch some old fucking hag hold signs up and see  little catchphrases that politicians use?  Hey, I'm voting for him.  Don't worry.  Obama is a piece of shit.  I don't like him.  I don't like his platform.  You don't want him in Washington.  Not in Washington.  You know, we didn't catch something that was going on.  Dog shit sniffer.  I heard they did a wave in the crowd and it ended when it got to him.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah.  Poor guy can't do the wave. 
[03:40:00]  That's not nice.  In Washington.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  See, I didn't forget.  Was she always Juno or did she change her name because that movie was popular for a few  weeks?  Might have been the movie thing, but I'm not sure.  She looks young.  She's a racist.  She spells it J-E-W-N-O.  I hate your guts.  Comes out next week, Jimmy.  A week from today.  Big day.  Big day.  Another runner-up line of the day.  That's great. 
[03:40:30]  There's a giant green thing with a plunger nose making me root.  Great at the glory hole.  Pops that thing right against it.  That little tongue comes out.  Stupid Philly fanatic.  Where are we at now?  Line of the day time.  One more runner-up?  My God.  We had a good show today.  Eep, eep, eep, eep, eep, eep.  That's hitting the fucking, it's hitting the wall. 
[03:41:00]  It's the crib.  Always.  Always.  Can you do the father?  Can you do the father again?  Hey, well, what are you doing in here?  I thought the girls were all playing outside, but if, ooh, mother might come in.  What about the, what do we have here?  What have we got here?  Hi.  You're, you're one of Cindy's friends, aren't you? 
[03:41:30]  I've seen you in the pool before.  But they're still at school.  You're touching my belt.  Why?  Oh.  This thing just had a little, like, Bateman from American Psycho.  Yes, a little bit.  That's fucking funny.  Line of the day time.  WebEx.com.  Thank you for sponsoring Line of the Day.  WebEx.  Wow.  Here.  Comes.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  These are the fine pasties. 
[03:42:00]  Those are the, oh.  Why did you put A and O?  That's Tracy's.  It should be an A and H.  A ho and mo.  Wow, what a great tag.  Hey, that sounded pretty good.  E-Rock and Payne are always funny.  Our new bit.  We got to figure out where to take that one. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  We're thinking face shots next.  E-Rock, would you take a face shot?  A facial.  You wouldn't take a face shot from the candle wax?  Not a face shot.  What's wrong with you?  Not a face shot.  We're not talking about hot wax.  You got props for playing me today.  Creepy, right?  People liked it.  People really did, yeah.  What do you got?  What do you got?  Oh, this was for tomorrow.  It's three speeches of McCain.  Every time he said, my friends, is about over a minute.  Wow.  Of just him going, my friends, my friends, my friends. 
[03:43:00]  Well, let's debut here.  Why not?  Let's give it a listen.  And then we'll make believe we didn't do this for the dummies that don't have satellite.  Let's see.  So just a montage of my friends?  Yeah.  From three speeches?  Three different speeches.  We all know, my friends.  I know how to do that, my friends.  My friend, I'd like you to.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  The last news is bad.  So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends.  But the problems are, my friends.  My friends, what we have to do.  Let's look at our records, my friends. 
[03:43:30]  My friends.  By the way, my friends, I vote against them, my friends.  We've got to drill offshore, my friends.  My friends.  Training, my friend.  Let me just follow up, my friends.  There was a lot at stake there, my friends.  I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends.  My friend.  But at the end of the day, my friend.  Thank you, my friends.  Thank you.  Thank you, my friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  Thank you, my friends.  My friends.  My friends. 
[03:44:00]  And my friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  By our friends and the other party.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  Man, I thought I had some crutches.  Oh, my God.  My friends.  My friends.  I'll give you $20 so I can fart right by your face.  My friends.  My friends.  I'll give you $20.  Oh, you got a good one, right?  I don't know.  Oh, E-Rock.  No, I won't touch you.  That's an easy $20.  $20.  That's easy. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah, come on, sit.  Here, sit down.  You got to sit it out.  You got to sit out the storm.  E-Rock, you were a star today, I must say.  You farted right when you bent over.  E-Rock.  Ha.  He just makes the best sounds.  Ha.  That was something out of a 50s TV show.  You know, like if you use Vicks and it burns your nose? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  It's like in the back of your nose?  Yeah, it burns your nose.  Wow.  Yeah, that's the bad shit.  My folks are going over Preparation H.  I got a roid.  A rotting roid.  The air just blows over and pushes it.  It is bad, right?  We're good.  Where are you going, E-Rock?  He's coming.  I got to step out of character.  E-Rock was great today.  How is his stomach that weak, though?  It's just a little...  That big in that week.  He starts to lose support, the bigger it gets. 
[03:45:30]  Alrighty.  Oh, oh.  Can you do a montage of pork barrel mentions?  The pork barrel one's up there, too.  Pork barrel.  Did you get some out?  Yeah, I covered up pretty quick.  It smells like a big armpit.  No, push it out.  It smells like an armpit that was rubbed on an asshole.  Fair enough.  A dead yak.  I'll accept your amendment to my...  It smells like an armpit if someone was trying to keep a log warm using their armpit.  I ain't sticking around for real.  Abu.  Abu.  It smells like an armpit that was warm using to keep a log for the armpits. 
[03:46:00]  Enough about the armpits.  Doesn't it suck bombing, Danny?  Let's just bask in Danny's bomb.  Especially when you know it's coming and you're like, I'll finish it anyway.  Only 40 more words to go.  That was nice.  What do you say on that great bit of comedy?  We end this Tuesday edition.  Let's leave this armpits.  Because when you want to keep your hands warm in the winter, see, they tell you to put... 
[03:46:30]  But you'd never warm a shit.  No one would take a shit and warm up your pits.  No.  Why would you warm up shit?  Or warm your pits up with human shit.  I just got a hot flash and a head rush at the same time.  We should probably humble show.  That'll do that.  That's right.  That's a combination called a douche chill.  All right, kiddies in radio land.  Wait.  Yes, Jimmy.  Jimmy's book.  What's it called?  You don't like it.  I hate everything about you. 
[03:47:00]  Look, the umbrella.  Is it automatic?  One of those open up when you press a button.  That worked as well as my joke.  Like shoving it in a cunt and opening it up.  And when it doesn't open all the way, she can go tight, huh?  Let's get the fuck out of here, okay?  We will see you tomorrow's Whip Mount Wednesday, everybody.  So we'll see you then.  And until then, have a dudini. </pre>
