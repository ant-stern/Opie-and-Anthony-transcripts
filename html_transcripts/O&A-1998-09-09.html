<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a discussion of a hidden track on The Clash's *London Calling*, transitioning into commentary on Mark McGwire's record-breaking home run.  They lauded the unifying national effect of the event, contrasting it with the divisive O.J. Simpson trial, and praised the announcers' restrained reaction.  A listener then called, furiously denouncing their "Candle in the Wind" parody dedicated to Marv Albert, deeming it disrespectful to Princess Diana.  The hosts countered that the song's melody was originally for Marilyn Monroe, engaging in a heated argument with the caller, who insulted them with homophobic and misogynistic slurs. The segment ended with the hosts spreading a rumour that Princess Diana was a "crack whore."

The show shifted to a discussion of the Million Youth March, criticizing Khalid Muhammad's absence and perceived cowardice following his inflammatory rhetoric. They contrasted him with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, playing a clip of a previous interview with Al Sharpton featuring outlandish claims about the Mayor and the march being about Beanie Babies.  An exclusive interview followed with a man claiming injuries sustained at the march, alleging assaults by both police and march participants, including being beaten, maced, and having a nightstick inserted into his anus. He further alleged that Al Sharpton laughed at and stepped on him.

The program then featured a call from "They Call My Name's Bill," the WNEW janitor, who recounted taking five Viagra pills, resulting in a prolonged and painful erection.  His attempts to get help from a pharmacist proved fruitless, leading to further comedic complaints about the resulting discomfort and size.  A brief discussion on Pee-wee Herman's comeback and past scandals followed, drawing comparisons to President Clinton's actions, culminating in a humorous bit imagining Pee-wee in *Cabaret*.

The show concluded with renewed discussion of the Million Youth March footage dominating news coverage, and a replay of the Marv Albert tribute song, again prompting complaints about its perceived disrespect to Princess Diana.  The hosts then discussed their personal lives; Opie's aversion to marriage and Anthony's past experience of living in his car after being evicted from his mother's house.  The broadcast ended with a final reference to the exclusive interview with the injured man from the Million Youth March and a brief reflection on their radio show and its popularity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Track off London Calling.  When I found that ditty back in the early 80s, I was pretty psyched.  Why are you?  I don't know why that was like a hidden track on this CD.  Does anyone know the story behind that?  I don't know. Hidden tracks were pretty new.  But did the record company maybe just screw up and forgot to put that track 19 was Train in Vain?  Maybe.  Maybe.  It was pretty much the best song off.  Well, London Calling was good.  Spanish Bombs was good.  Lost in the Supermarket was really good.  Just accept it, Opie.  All right. Accept it for what it is?  Yeah.  All right. I can do that. 
[00:00:30]  It's Opie. It's Anthony.  Hey.  And it's you guys listening, which we totally appreciate.  I guess everyone's talking about Mark McGuire, so we should give our two cents really fast.  Yeah. I owe you 20 bucks.  Yeah. Where is my 20 bucks?  I'll give it to you.  I want it right now.  I'll pay you. I'm good for it.  All right.  I got to get to an ATM.  Anthony wasn't convinced that Mark was going to hit the homer last night, and I was like,  no way. He's got to do it at home. It's happening.  I thought it just seemed too storybooked. Like, real life doesn't happen like that. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Where it's the home field, and you know.  How cool was it that that was the shortest homer he hit all year long, and no fans really  got a chance at the ball.  He hit it into a chuck hole.  Yeah.  Or something.  Yeah.  It was like, the space that he hit it in wasn't that big.  Not at all. And the groundskeeper, that little kid got it. It was hysterical. Mr. McGuire,  I got something that belongs to you. I stayed up till like 1230 watching the coverage.  It just seemed like the whole thing was scripted. Yeah.  You know, it was weird. It was like a movie. 
[00:01:30]  It was cool. I got to admit, it was really cool. And what I think is cool about this whole  Mark McGuire thing, it brought the whole nation together for a positive reason.  True.  When we all start talking about one thing that has happened in the country, it's like the  OJ verdict. Clinton's going to make his apology speech. You know, plane crash. You know, like  the old days, you know, everyone got together to watch the first moon landing. Right.  Or the first space shuttle mission. We haven't had one of those in a really long time. And 
[00:02:00]  this Mark McGuire thing kind of brought the country together the last few days. But we  could go about the business of hating each other today. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, get  right back to it. Yeah. If Sammy Stokes and Mark McGuire can get along, why can't everyone  else? We are the world. I just like the fact that I got to take my hat off to the announcers  because they just shut their mouths. He hit the home run, runs around the bases, he starts  doing his little thing and the announcers shut up. Yes. Which was great because the worst 
[00:02:30]  thing is watching a historic moment like that and you have to hear, there it is, the home  run that will stand out in the annals of history. You know, Mark McGuire must be feeling really  good right about now. There he is holding his, you know, we can see and think for ourselves,  shut up. They just called the homer really fast and then they didn't talk for five minutes  and it was great. I completely enjoyed that part of it. That worked. That worked. Very 
[00:03:00]  good. Thank you. So there we go. We move on. But it's really funny. If Sammy Stokes ends  up beating McGuire, you know, yesterday didn't mean anything really. Well, the breaking of the  record was a big thing. Yeah. It doesn't matter where it ends up. I think the actual breaking  of the Marist record was pretty big. Yeah. Cool. I watched. Yeah. That's what's weird.  You watched. Your wife watched. Yeah. Yeah. Because you guys are a huge, I mean, you guys  are Yankee fans. Yeah. You'll watch the Yankee game. I'm not going to watch the Cardinals 
[00:03:30]  game. But you're not going to go out of your way to watch the Cardinals Cubs on a Tuesday  night. No. You know? Mm-mm. And that's what was so special about this moment. Everyone  checked it out. Yes. So. All right. What do you got today? 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. That's  the phone line. Wow. You guys are already ringing the phone. That's cool. Faxes could  be sent to 2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W. I'm punching this up right now. W-N-E-W.com. Instant email  us. People are really starting to dig the instant feedback. Mm-hmm. Getting email on 
[00:04:00]  that. They think it's a really cool thing that they can comment instantly on anything  we're talking about on the radio. Yeah. So make sure you do that. Take that. Take  advantage of that. On the way, we got 7 Mary 3 and The Who next.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. The Rock of New York with the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Jump, jive, and  wail from the dirty boog-ass CD. It's Opie and Anthony. Hello. Very, very sad day today.  Why is it sad? Well, I should say it's an emotional day today. Why? Why? Well, our pal 
[00:04:30]  Marv Albert got married. Got married. What the fuck? What? Who is this woman? She's  standing by him. Standing by him? Better not stand in front of him. She's got her ass  bitten. Yeah, Marv got married today and he's going to be back on TV starting next week,  it looks like. Yes! Yes! I think it would be very nice to have a haunting tribute to Marv  today on The Opie and Anthony Show. What do you think, Anthony? Sure. Okay. Check it out on  N-E-W. 1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. The Rock of New York with the Bare Naked Ladies. One week. 
[00:05:00]  Oh.  We've got to get the curses out of that, then we'll put it on the air, I guess.  Some lady didn't like our Marv Albert tribute song. She found it very offensive, Opie.  Yes, because that song was intended for Lady Di. As she said, yeah. That song is for Lady Di.  I guess she forgot about Marilyn. All right, well, I've got to get the curses out. We'll put  that on the air. People are so close-minded. I laugh at close-minded people. All right, 
[00:05:30]  we're really not prepared here because we were just yelling at the lady for the last  ten minutes, so. She's probably got all the Lady Di dolls and all the memorabilia they've  been selling over the past year, talking to these rubes like her. I need my Lady Di. Look,  a Lady Di plate for $29. I've got to send for it. It's a plate of Lady Di. It shows how much  I loved her. Oh. Okay. Well, life. Well, it's Opie and Anthony. Instead of sitting on 
[00:06:00]  your ass worshiping Lady Di, why not get out a little? Maybe take up a couple of the causes  that she took up. That would be nice. You know, maybe that would put a little energy  behind this fascination that you have with the woman. Yes. And why don't you worship Mother  Teresa, who did a lot more. Why, Opie? You know why? Because she was an ugly old woman.  That's the truth. Yeah. Why do you think no one cared when she died? Right. Because  she was an ugly, wrinkled, dirty old woman who kissed people's feet in Calcutta instead 
[00:06:30]  of the well-dressed. Did you see an auction for that gunny sack that she wore? No. There's  auctions every other week for all Lady Di stuff. Oh, it's the little barrette Lady Di  wearing her hair. Oh, I got to pay six billion dollars for it. Where's the gunny sack? And  that little tablecloth she wore over her shoulder. Yeah. And on her head. And the funerals of  the two people were drastically different. You know, I, no, I couldn't tell the difference 
[00:07:00]  between the two. There was the Lady Di funeral with the pomp and circumstance and guns and soldiers  all well-dressed and the casket being paraded. And then there was a bumpy ride that Mother  Teresa took in Calcutta. I think she almost bounced out of the casket five times. And  it was a wooden casket. And it was uncovered. Yeah. You just saw, like, she was melting in  the sun, it looked like. Yeah. But no one remembers her. It's ladies like the one we just talked 
[00:07:30]  to. Well, we'll have to put a little piece of that on the air when we put all the curses  out. This woman's mentality. Yeah. It's brilliant, actually, to be honest with you. Yes. I learned  something from that lady today. Oh, so did I. 212-757-1027. If you've got anything to add  to this mess we call the Opie and Anthony show, or if you want to fax us, 212-957-WNEW. Anything  coming in through the feedback yet, Ant? No. Okay. Very good. Thanks for your support. We  appreciate it. On the way, we've got Days of the News. Stay there. 212-7-WNEW, The Rock of 
[00:08:00]  New York with Tom Petty from Into the Great Wide Open CD. Cheryl Crow's latest before that,  My Favorite Mistake, off her new CD, The Globe Sessions. Good afternoon. It's Opie. It's  Anthony. And we've got a lady on the line here who did not like, Anthony, your Marv Albert  tribute song. I don't care. It was a very, very touching song, I thought. Of course. It's  okay. You know, I don't even care. I think she didn't even really listen to the words. She's  offended because you used Goodbye, Norma Jean. Yeah. Candle in the Wind. Right. You used 
[00:08:30]  the karaoke to that to sing about Marv Albert, and she thinks that song should be for Lady  Di. Want to talk to this mess? Yeah. Hi, N.E.W. I am in absolute shock as to the song that  just played to the tune of Goodbye, English Rose. Oh, yes. The Marv Albert tribute. It was  taunting, wasn't it? Why did you play it? What do you mean? Don't you think that that 
[00:09:00]  was very offensive to play on the air? Why was it offensive? Princess Diana. Whoa, whoa,  whoa, wait. You're mad because that song was originally done for Princess Diana? Are you  smoking crank? First of all, that song was done for Marilyn Monroe originally. Get it through  your thick skull. I think that you are being very, very unprofessional. You're not accepting  my call. Hey, the president is putting cigars up girls' anatomy. We can do anything. He's  the figurehead of the country. Are you on the air now? Yeah, we're on the air. He's the 
[00:09:30]  figurehead of this country, and he's... Well, I didn't call about the president. Well, he's  the top of the heap, and if he's doing that, we can do whatever we want. Well, why are you...  I'm just curious again. This song was chosen, and every time I even hear the tune, I, as millions  and millions of people, think of Princess Diana. You are a loser. I'd like to know, what is  your name? You're a loser. I think of Princess Diana. My name is Opie, and this is Anthony, 
[00:10:00]  and you can write all your complaint letters you want to CBS Radio. You're a loser. You know  what you are? Go ahead. I've heard it all. You are a perverted, sick animal. Oh, ouch.  You should be ashamed. I'm ashamed. I'm very ashamed of Opie. Oh, that hurts. You're right.  I am ashamed of Opie. The way you're talking, your demeanor, shows what kind of caliber person  you are. Yeah, that's exactly right. You hit it right on the head. No, the way you're talking, 
[00:10:30]  you're insane. You think that song is for Lady Di? Did they not play it at her funeral? It's  for Marilyn Monroe. He just revamped a few words. It was originally for Marilyn Monroe,  and then it was chosen by the same person that was asked to sing at home. People die in car  crashes every day. I want to ask you, I'm just curious. They did a lot more than Lady Di.  How could you even put such garbage on the air? Because people enjoy it. They do. Anything  else? I got to move on with the radio show here. Anything else? I got to move on with the 
[00:11:00]  radio show. The whole world doesn't revolve around children. Let's put Barney on the air  24 hours a day. It'll be a perfect world. Do me a favor and stop listening to our radio  show. You're not allowed. Stop. Save the channel right now. Thank you. I am stopping. I hung  up on her. Not for her. Wow. Perverted sick animal. Yeah. That's what she said. She's probably  the same woman that is totally behind Bill Clinton. I think it's time to move on. We've heard 
[00:11:30]  too much of this. Perverted sick animal. Another hypocrite one. I don't even want to deal with  people like that. Don't call any one of those people. Had it. It gets my juices flowing when  they call them. I love that stuff. On the way, we got Rush and Harvey Danger. Stay there. N-E-W.  Anthony, this just in? Yes. Lady Di was a crack whore. Oh my God. I didn't read that. It's coming  across on the AP wire. Lady Di was a crack whore. 1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York with Harvey 
[00:12:00]  Danger. 1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York with Green Day. It's Opie. It's Anthony. Hey, did  you notice the Green Day song they were playing yesterday when Mark McGuire made his loop around  the field? Uh, no. What was it? They were playing Good Riddance. Oh, really? Hope you had  the time of your life. I just heard, uh, when he would come up to bat, they would play Welcome  to the Jungle. That was pretty cool. Yeah. Interesting. And that was kind of a whippy  homer yesterday. Yeah. But he got the job done. That's all it takes. Yeah. Just to go 
[00:12:30]  over the fence. It was so cool. I'm still just thinking about that moment all day long here  today. Pretty neat. Yeah. So. All right. Um, well, did they find the coward yet? I'm looking,  I'm watching New York 1 and they're showing footage of the Million Youth March. Well, how do you?  The first lie about that, let's just get it out of the way. It was like the 3,500 person  March, wasn't it? Yeah. Pretty much. I think they had 4,000 people there. Wasn't it like  4,000? Something like that. Yeah. And Khalid Muhammad, he's all brave, you know, spewing 
[00:13:00]  his hate, the black Hitler. And now the cops are looking for him. And what is Khalid doing?  Hiding. He's hiding. There's your leader, boys and girls. What a brave man he is. No, that's  there. Martin Luther King never hid from no one. He didn't speak like Khalid Muhammad  either. Malcolm X wouldn't hide. Occasionally he spoke like Khalid Muhammad. Yeah, he did,  but that's all right. That was the early Malcolm X years. He's a coward though. Yeah. So there's 
[00:13:30]  a, they're still trying to figure out who started a little melee at the end of the Million Youth  March the other day. Uh-huh. Cops say it was Khalid and his, and his boys. Up on stage,  yeah, spewing hate and trying to incite a riot. And Khalid insists that the cops moved  in too soon and started trouble. Well, I think I was saying, I mean, if you have a parade  or a meeting and, uh, you're all organized and it's not hate filled, maybe the cops will  give you five, ten minutes to clean up after your, your little, uh, what is that called that 
[00:14:00]  they give you? A permit. After the time that your permit says you're supposed to be off the  street, you think the cops have to hear and take the cops guns and shoot the police. You  think they're going to sit there and go, you know, um, it's four, but give Khalid 10, 15  more minutes. All right. No, no, I just want to see where he's going with this. Yeah. Maybe  he'll say that, you know, get your own guns and start shooting the cops. Yeah. What the  heck? Of course the cops are going to storm up there at four o'clock. They're not going to 
[00:14:30]  wait and see what happens. It was getting ugly. Besides the Al Sharpton float hasn't gone by  yet. Yeah. The big inflatable Al float was hung up in the trees because of the wind.  Why? Why? Why? Why I got hung up in the trees, my big float? How come Woody Woodpecker don't  get hung up in the trees, but my big fat ribbon Al float get hung up in the tree? We had Al  on the show yesterday and he was explaining exactly what happened at the Million Youth March  on Saturday. Yeah, this cleared a lot up. Let's go to this again from yesterday. No justice, 
[00:15:00]  no peace. No justice, no peace. All right, Al, speak your mind. What's wrong? What's wrong?  Khalid Mohammed was upset because the police did not have to move in on us. The police should  have been at the mayor's house. Why the mayor's house? Because at the very time we was having  the march, the mayor was sexually assaulting Tawana Brawley. Absolutely. The mayor and the  police commissioner were sexually assaulting Tawana Brawley. That is so wrong and you know 
[00:15:30]  it. Absolutely. But the police felt it was more important to stop Khalid Mohammed from speaking  about Beanie Babies. That's all he was talking about. Beanie Babies. But while the mayor and the  police commissioner and Alfonso Mato are sexually assaulting Tawana Brawley, they felt they had to  break up our little Beanie Baby quilting bee because we was all so quilting. You were quilting 
[00:16:00]  out there. A quilting bee, Beanie Baby conversation while Governor Pataki and Pat Moynihan are selling  crack to second graders. Come on. We was having a quilting bee discussing Beanie Babies and the  police stormed the stage. Khalid Mohammed even said, excuse me, sirs. May we have five more minutes  while I make this last stitch? And the police went crazy beating everybody. Beating me right over 
[00:16:30]  the head. If it weren't for my hair processing, I'd be injured right now. But I have bulletproof  hair. You sure do, Al. So until this is investigated, I will keep fighting. Because Tawana Brawley  was sexually assaulted by the mayor, police chief, the Easter Bunny, and the Loch Ness Monster.  No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. All right, Al, get out of here. I think they're  dishonest. Good. Love it. 1027 WNEW, the rock of New York with Tragically Hip. That's Poets 
[00:17:00]  off the Phantom Power CD. Sounds a little bit like the Stones when they were doing their  thing in the 80s. Yeah. And we had the Stones before that from Tattoo You, waiting on a friend.  It's Opie, it's Anthony. Hey, man. On the way, there's a guy on the line. Yeah. That got  hurt at the Million Youth March, and he will be suing everyone. Really? He's going to sue  everyone. And we're going to talk to him. Yes, he's going to give us the exclusive, and  we're going to put him on the air in about 20 minutes. Great. I'm psyched. Things are 
[00:17:30]  starting to happen here. We're getting more and more exclusives for the Opie and Anthony  show. Okay. All right. What else are we going to do today on the show? What do we have planned  for later? I want to talk about Pee Wee. Okay, we can do that. And I heard something on  the news, you know, that Swiss Air thing, pretty tragic. Horrible. Horrible. You know, anybody  that's connected with the relatives of it. It's horrible. Yes. And it brings out something  in human nature that I don't understand. The need for this horrible sorrow and everything 
[00:18:00]  when people die. You know, you go to a funeral, because I heard today that they're going to  have a bunch of sixth graders lay a wreath at the site and sing Lean On Me. Now, is there  a reason to have a heart-wrenching scene like that? I think it makes the victim's families  feel a little better about the tragedy. Better? How does anything like that make you feel better?  You mourn. You do what you have to do. But then to drag yourself to these memorials, and 
[00:18:30]  this isn't just the Swiss Air thing. I mean, this is when anybody dies, your family or whatever.  Why do you have to go for weeks of these, like, the wake? The wake's got to last for  a week. And then the funeral. And then you've got to go to the church. And you go to these  services. I went to a service last week, and there's bagpipes playing. You're fine. And  then the bagpipes start playing, and you lose it. Yeah. Is it necessary? Some people, that's  the way they mourn. I mean, can we make it any sad? Let's get the sixth graders to sing Lean 
[00:19:00]  on Me and lay a wreath. Can we play the final scene of the Titanic on a big screen, too?  Just to stir it up a little more. You know, in our family, when someone dies, it's a huge  party. Is it? Yeah, it really is. See, those are good. Unless it's a tragic death, God forbid.  Knock on wood. But in general, there's more jokes being thrown around the room. Yeah, well,  that's usually with a lot of things, too, to loosen up the mood. But they usually start  out as these, yeesh. They just bring you down. So you don't think the sixth graders should 
[00:19:30]  be singing Lean on Me as a tribute to that. No, you know what that's going to sound like?  The real high little kiddie voices? Ooh, give me the heebie-jeebies. Yeah. That brings  back a memory when we had a deal with the cancer kids, and they were singing Christmas  songs. Oh, my God. Oh. I mean, I was dying. I don't even know how we tell people this.  Me and Aunt Believer have done a lot for charity. I know it's hard to believe, but we do it under  the blanket of the veil of the dark. I know. That night, and we're caped crusaders. I think 
[00:20:00]  it's because we really feel guilty about our radio show. We just don't want to go to hell,  so we're trying not to even the odds. But we do do a lot of charity, and we ended up in  this situation once where we were at a children's hospital for kids with cancer, and it was near  Christmas time, and it was a great scene. It was a great scene. All these kids were hanging  around, and they were singing Christmas carols. There's no joke here, by the way, ladies.  No, this is just the way it was. This is a taste of reality. And when, like, me and 
[00:20:30]  Anthony really touched, like, this is really cool. They're all singing on key, and the  counselors are singing along with the kids. Yeah. And then I go outside, because I was  getting like, whoa, this is intense. And somebody who works at the hospital goes, you  know, most of these kids will not make it to Christmas. Oh. I'm like, holy, did I need  to hear that? It was just like, oh, my. It was horrible. I know. Very sad. Horrible.  Yeah. I think people, some people like being sad. I really like being sad. Hmm? If it's 
[00:21:00]  for the right reasons. I don't know. You know, like, I like being. I'm a happy guy. I like  being happy, but I also like, I like being depressed. You like being depressed? Sometimes, because  as long as I know, like, I'm going to get out of it. You're effed up, man. I have a dark  side, but as long as I know, I'm going to get out of the depression, I really enjoy  wallowing. Maybe it makes the highs seem that much better. It makes them that much  better, yeah. As long as you realize that life is like a lot of ups and downs, like a  roller coaster, and, you know, you're going to have those ups. You're in it for the long 
[00:21:30]  haul. You're in it for the long haul. Exactly. So as long as you can understand that you're  depressed, you're down, you know, things really don't look good for you. Yeah. But as long  as you know that it's going to go up eventually, it's kind of fun to wallow in that  depression. See, my emotions, I like putting them through like a voltage regulator. It gets  the spikes out, you know. Keep it straight. I don't like being too happy. I don't like  being too sad. Well, that's what scares me, too, because if things are going really well  in my life and I get a lot of highs in a row, I'm like, oh, here it comes. What the 
[00:22:00]  hell is around the corner, man? Who is going to just put that knife in my back and twist  hard? Because you know it's coming. All right. But we got that person that's going to be  suing everyone that got hurt in the Million Youth March. And if you want to add something  to the show, phones are a little light today. I think we've shocked some people. I don't  know. 212-757-1027.  Wow, this must be the digitally remastered version of Steve Miller's Fly Like an Eagle. 
[00:22:30]  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York. Sophie and Anthony. You know, that whistle sounded like 
[00:23:00]  something. What? Do that whistle again. No, no. No, that whistle. God, you have too many  whistles. Not that whistle. That whistle. Yeah. Now, what does that sound like? Do the first  one again. Oh, the UFO from the Brady Bunch? Yeah, thank you. Wow, a UFO. I'm going on a UFO. 
[00:23:30]  Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. That was the sound of the ghost from the ghost episode.  Right. UFO was...  Ghost was...  Oh, people are listening to us. Oh, we got to say hi to Jill and Tracy. Not anymore. 
[00:24:00]  In Suffering, New York. Faithful listeners of the show. We appreciate that. I always find it  funny to announce names on the radio. Yeah. Because there's like a million people that  are there going, who cares? And the other, you know, the two people, like Jill and Tracy,  they're in an office right now jumping up and down going, they mentioned my name. Well,  it can't be like Romper Room. What are we supposed to hold up the magic mirror? I see Bobby  and Billy and Jimmy and Joe. Yeah. All right. That's cool, I guess. Yeah. Made them happy.  Oh, Rick says that on line seven, we got that guy that was hurt at the Million Youth March, 
[00:24:30]  Anthony. All right. Well, this is good. Gives us a little insight. A little insight. A guy  that was there, and actually, he got hurt. He did. And he's going to be suing everyone,  and this is definitely an exclusive for us. Well, let's hear him. I don't think he's talking  to any other radio station in New York, so... All right. Hello, you there? Hello. Yeah,  I heard you were hurt at the Million Youth March Saturday. Yes, I was very injured,  and I'm going to be suing. I'm suing everyone, Khalid Muhammad and the NYPD. I'm suing everybody. 
[00:25:00]  Well, what happened Saturday? I was very injured. I attended the Million Youth March. I went for  unity for the young people, and I wore my little bow tie, and I was there in support, and the  Negroes hit me. They were beating me. I was standing by the chitlins booth trying to buy  some food, some soul food, and I got kicked by souls on boots. They were hitting me. I was 
[00:25:30]  very injured. I ran to the barricades where the police were. Yeah, and then what happened?  They put their nightsticks in my butt. I was very injured. I told them that I was getting  beaten by the Negroes, and the police started bashing me over their heads, and they sprayed  me with mace. I couldn't see as they sprayed me, and then I felt a nightstick go in my butt. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, and I hurt now, and my eyes sting. Yeah, your eyes sting? That's too bad.  I'm very injured, and I'm suing. Okay, wow. I went to shake Khalid Muhammad's hand, and his  henchmen cracked my skull apart with a microphone stand, and they called me names like Cracker  and Honky, and as they bashed me, and then some young brother kicked me in the ball sack, and I 
[00:26:30]  ruptured, and I laid there in the street, writhing in pain, and the police did nothing but laugh at  me. A horse came, a police horse, and put his hoof in my ass. I'm very injured. I'm suing everybody.  Did you see Al Sharpton there?  I saw the Reverend Al. I pleaded for help, and he just laughed at me, and stepped on me, and his  big fat weight hurt me. He took the big Volkswagen hubcap medallion and bashed upon my head. I'm 
[00:27:00]  very injured. I'm suing everyone, and if I keep on the phone, I'll sue you. Okay, well, I don't know.  Good luck with your lawsuit again. Thank you. Thank you, then. All right.  Opie and Anthony. 1027.  27 WNEW, the Rock of New York STP for the drive home. It's Opie. It's Anthony. Also in their  ACDC and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Somehow, somewhere, someway. That is the Rock of New York, ladies 
[00:27:30]  and gentlemen. Oh, no. Here he comes. The janitor of WNEW. His name is, they call my name's Bill.  He's been here for 40 years, I do believe. I can't fit my little rascal through until you move  some chairs, please. Anthony, help him out. He wants to get his little rascal in the studio  here. He's always trying to get in. He knows he can't fit with that thing. Yeah. But if  you move some chairs, I'll be able to fit, thank you. All right. Let him up to a microphone,  Anthony. Now, his battery's really soft. I might scoot up to five miles per hour. 
[00:28:00]  Yes. They call my name's Bill. How are you today? Very good. Let me roll in here. All  right. Hey, your little rascal's looking really shiny. I like that. I washed and waxed it for  Labor Day. Very nice. It's a chick magnet. Yeah, I see that. I see you got a little bell  on there. I got the bell and the horn. And the horn. And you got some baseball cards in  the spokes. Very nice. Yes. Look at your Terminator glasses. They're pretty fine, huh? I had cataract  surgery and the sun hurts my eyes. They're pretty big. They're wraparounds. Oh, I got 
[00:28:30]  that. Yeah. And why are your pants pulled up to your nipples, they call my name's Bill?  Because I'm an old man and this is how we all wear our pants. Oh, I see. Way up around  the nipples. So, why a visit to the Opie and Anthony show this afternoon? I'm having a  little trouble. What do you mean you're having a little trouble? What? I can't stand up,  so you have to look down. Let me back out a little. All right. Look down here. Yeah, you're  in your little rascal. Oh, look down at my pants. Whoa! What the heck is going on with 
[00:29:00]  your crotch? I had a problem at the home. What happened at the home? They call my name's  Bill. I took Viagra. I got it with vitamins. And I took five. You took five Viagra pills?  You're not supposed to do that. One will do the trick. I almost catapulted myself out of  my little rascal scooter. So, you pretty much OD'd on Viagra. That's a dangerous thing.  I know, and I need some help. Why? It won't go down? It won't go away. I'm in pain. All 
[00:29:30]  right. Hold on a minute. I'm going to dial up the pharmacy for you. Thank you, please.  You're quite welcome. Thank you, please. They call my name's Bill. Yes, we got that. How  long have you been working at NEW, by the way, Bill? I don't remember. I've been here  since Scott Muni was an intern. Oh, really? So, it's got to be going on 80 years. All right.  Very nice. So, all right. Well, we got the pharmacy. It's ringing. You took five Viagra  pills, Bill, and you need to know what to do. I'm feeling faint. Okay. Here's the guy. 
[00:30:00]  Hello. Can I help you? Yes, please. They call my name's Bill. I have a couple of questions,  please. I'm an elderly gentleman. Yes. I'm calling about the drug Viagra. Right. It's the  impotent stroke. Right. How does this work? Um, it acts upon smooth muscle tissue. Um, it's  a tablet. It's taken by mouse. Um... Orally. Orally, correct. Well, um, one of the gentlemen 
[00:30:30]  at my home has, and, uh, he had some, and I mixed them up with my vitamins, and I took  five. You took five of them? Yeah, and now I'm, I'm hurting. Yeah, I believe so. It's blown  up like a party balloon. I have quite an erection, and I want to know what I could do to get rid  of it. Um... I'm an elderly gentleman. They call my name's Bill. Right. Is there something  I could do? It's got a life of its own, I tell you. Yeah, I know. It's like a, uh, it's, I swear 
[00:31:00]  it's like a party balloon. Like I could make a giraffe out of it if I wanted to. But it's hurting  now, and I need, uh, something to do with this. Right. To get rid of it. Do you have  any drugs to get rid of it? No, we don't. Should I just stare at a picture of Rosie O'Donnell?  Would that work, please? It might work for me, that's for sure. No help from the pharmacist.  Thank you. I'm sorry. I tried just squeezing it, thinking it would go away, but then my testicles 
[00:31:30]  blew up like hoppity hops. I just can't get rid of it. I took five pills, and it's out  of control. I know. It's on a mission. I look like a, my name should be Tyrone. Yeah, we're  going to have to wait out the storm, I think. My wife ran away. She was frightened. It was  so big, she couldn't get wet at Niagara Falls. She's like 70 years old, and she hasn't seen 
[00:32:00]  a monster like that since the Kaiser was in charge over in Germany. It's like a big blood  sausage. I know. You ever see those at like fairs? Big blood sausage is what I got. It's  turning purple. It's like I got an eggplant between my legs. I would go to the ER. ER will  take care of it? Yeah. I need a bun for my blood sausage. I think so. Maybe a nurse 
[00:32:30]  could take care of that one for me. I think so. I don't think I'll fit in the ambulance.  Quite frankly, they might slam it in the rear door. They could put you up on top. I look  funny laying on a gurney covered with a blanket. It looked like a teepee. For crying out loud  at you. Okay. Well, I would go there. Oh, thank you for your, for your help, Mr. Pharmacist,  please. No problem. Thank you, please. Bye. There he goes. They call my name's Bill. 
[00:33:00]  Opie and Anthony, Rock, New York. The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, another track from  the debut CD from Matchbox 20. That's a long day from their CD, yourself or someone like  you. It's Opie, it's Anthony. Hey. And it's everyone driving home. Got awfully cold today.  Yeah, it's kind of that, that fall feel. Are we going to just go right to winter, you  think? Or are we going to have that Indian summer? I mean, no. Some parts of Canada, we're up  to 90 degrees. Today? Yeah. Oh, that's encouraging. Isn't that weird? That is strange. And then 
[00:33:30]  we're like in the 60s. Why aren't you wearing a long sleeve shirt today like everyone else,  Anthony? You won't see me in a long sleeve shirt until probably February. February? That's  when I start realizing, hmm, it's winter, isn't it? I'm like one of those dopes that  just, I mean, a t-shirt freezing. Yeah. Anthony, it's winter. I'm the guy, as soon as November  hits, I put long johns on. Do you? I'm a wimp. I don't like long johns, though. No? Nah, 
[00:34:00]  they're uncomfortable. Why are we talking about long johns? Yeah, I know. Let's get off  this. Just a thought. Plenty of time for that. Yeah, we have plenty of months to talk about  that stuff, but seeing the post today? What? Pee Wee Herman is coming back once again.  Oh yeah, let me see this. Contro... Why do they call him controversial comedian, Pee Wee  Herman? Yeah. All of a sudden he's controversial? What I don't understand is... Because he  whipped out a batch in a porno theater years ago? Yeah. What he did is tame compared to 
[00:34:30]  what our president is doing. So can we please put Pee Wee Herman back on TV? We need good  TV once again, right? He loses his job on a kiddie show for doing it in a porno theater.  Yes. Oh, not the Oval Office. Right. And the president is, you know, I'm sorry, I apologize.  Watching Monica put cigars in places where the sun don't shine and he's still our president.  This is the country we live in. This is great. This is awesome. Something as important as  a kiddie show host. Yeah. He's coming back. He's going to probably be the main guy in Cabaret. 
[00:35:00]  They're trying to get him. On Broadway. For that rolling cabaret that Joel Gray immortalized  in the movie. Yes. The movie with Liza Minnelli. They kind of look similar, actually, if you  look at the picture side by side. Yeah, that whole makeup thing, the white face and the slick  back hair. Lipstick. Pee Wee thinking. Oh no. Don't fit the spanking. Your bone in your 
[00:35:30]  room. Come on. Come on to where I whip it out and play. Come at the cabaret. Oh, chum.  Come at the cabaret. Cherry. Conky. The secret word today, boys and girls, is splooge. Whenever  you hear the word splooge, spank it real hard. Captain Carl. Captain Carl. Very nice, Pee Wee. 
[00:36:00]  Very nice. So, we look forward to seeing Pee Wee Herman on Broadway. Hey, Pee Wee, what  do you think of President Clinton? Hmm? Oh, Phil Clinton. Yeah. Seems he can spank it, but I  can't. Doesn't seem very fair, does it? Well, he wasn't spanking it. I think if he was spanking  it, then, you know, there wouldn't be a problem. Well, it's not like I put anything in Miss  Yvonne on my show. Miss Yvonne. Miss Yvonne. Sit on. Let me take a cigar and assault you 
[00:36:30]  with it. All right. Very good. Good commentary from Pee Wee Herman. Clocky. I'm going to faint.  Yes. Very good. Okay. All right. Thank you. You're welcome, Pee Wee. Thanks for coming 
[00:37:00]  by today. All right. 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. If you got something to add, could someone get  rid of Pee Wee Herman, please? Fact line is 2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W. On the way, we got the latest  Pee Wee Herman. Mailman Mike. Mailman Mike. 27-W-N-E-W. The Rock of New York with Billy  Idol. It's Opie and Anthony. Hey. Will they stop showing footage of the Million Youth March, 
[00:37:30]  the melee that occurred at the end of it? That's all TV is showing today. Yeah. There's  two things that I've seen on this TV above us. Mark McGuire's Homer, which I've now seen  officially 358 times. It was cool, but now I think I got it in my brain. Yeah. The visual  is there. Yes. I could go to different camera shots in my head. Yeah, I think so. I need  a director. I don't need to see it anymore. I got it all in my brain for eternity, I do 
[00:38:00]  believe. I even got the moment when he pointed to the sky. I got when he jumped in the stands  and he hugged the Maris family. I got it all in my brain. I got the point where he almost  missed first base and the coach pointed at it and he had to turn around and step on it.  I got it all in my head. I don't need to see it anymore. It was a great, fabulous moment  for sports, but we don't need to see it anymore, do we? What do you think he was saying to the  Maris family? Put his arms around him and like tucked his head in there? I know what he  said. Like, ha ha, I beat you, pa. He said, no, go home and get a life. 
[00:38:30]  No, just kidding. That's my spotlight, guys. Go home. Right. No. I don't think so. And  then they're showing the melee. Yeah. At the Million Youth March. You know, we're getting  a lot of requests for that exclusive we had earlier. Oh, yes. Maybe we could play it before  we get out of here, but we actually had an interview with a guy who was hurt at the Million 
[00:39:00]  Youth March and he's suing everyone. Yeah. It sounded tragic. It sounded very, very sad.  His injuries sounded pretty serious. Yeah. So maybe we could get that interview on again  before seven o'clock before Matt Devote steps in. We'll do that. All right. Also, a lot  of people want to hear the Marv Albert song again. Really? Yeah, they do. Well, the reason  we broke it out today is because Marv Albert got married. Yes. Yes. I accept this woman as  my lawfully wedded wife. Yes. Yes. Now bear your ass so I may bite it. Yes. That honeymoon. 
[00:39:30]  Imagine that. Oh, that's scary. Like they go on the honeymoon. What's this woman thinking?  I don't know. He takes off his hair. Yeah. Honey, let me take off my hair. Who threw the  bouquet? Did Marv? Was he wearing the gown? Could you see that? All of a sudden he comes  out and he's wearing the wedding gown. But the garters and stuff. Yes. Yes. What a snazzy  little ensemble. I'm wearing yes. He's got it on under his suit, I do believe. But instead 
[00:40:00]  of the veil, you push his hair back over his head and he can bite the bride. What a sick  scene that's got to be. I honestly like Marv a lot. Marv. Yes. And you know, I'm kind of  hypocritical, I guess. Why? I just thought of something. Uh-uh. Well, I think the president  should leave office for what he has done. Uh-huh. But I think Marv belongs on TV because he's  a great sportscaster. No, I think that's hypocritical from me. I don't think so because I don't think 
[00:40:30]  a sportscaster, uh, his moral, uh, morals and scruples are very important. Yeah. I don't  care what he does if he does his job right, but part of doing his job isn't, uh, his morality  and his judgment. Part of the president's job absolutely is judgment. Yeah. If nothing  else, what Bill Clinton did shows a man with a bad judgment. That is bad judgment. I think  I have a problem because he lied to the American people. Even beyond all that. 
[00:41:00]  As far as being the president of the United States, lying to the people, hey, you know  something? You might even still be able to run the country as a liar. You're probably  doing pretty good. You're doing real well. But it shows his lack of judgment doing what  he did in the Oval Office. And you need judgment to run the presidency. Very good. So, that's  it. Now, Marv, you know, hey, Sean. Yes. Yes. Nothing but net. Yes. Well, I don't know. 
[00:41:30]  Who cares what he's doing on his off time? I simply want him back because I'm a huge hoops  fan. And Bob Costas just didn't cut it in the NBA finals this year. Now, that was horrible.  It was a great contrast to what we saw last night when McGuire hit the home run. And you  just see the crowd, hear the crowd, and the sportscasters kept their mouths shut. There  was no, what a thrilling day for sport and baseball. McGuire takes the field. Look at  him waving. Here he is picking up his son as he goes over and hugs America. Hey, hey, 
[00:42:00]  shut up. We see all that. I can see him watching. Just shut up. It's much more dramatic when  they just showed the scene for five minutes. Right. And Bob Costas was horrible during  the finals with Jordan. Jordan, this could be it. This could be the last time we ever,  ever see Michael Jordan. Oh, my God. Did you see the shot that? Yeah, we saw and we're  watching and we're looking. Just shut up. And we'd be able to concentrate more if you 
[00:42:30]  would just shut up. Yeah. Now, Marv knew how to handle it. Very good. All right. So  we want to play the Marv Alberts song again. Yes, yes, yes. In honor of Marv Redding. Yes.  The funny thing is, to the faithful listeners out there, every time we play this song, we  tick off a lot of older ladies because they're convinced that we're making fun of Lady Di.  You figure it out. Who cares? I don't get that one, but maybe someone out there can explain  that one to us. Here's the Marv Alberts song on N.E.W.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York with the verb, Bittersweet Symphony. Eve 6 before that 
[00:43:00]  with that catchy song, Inside Out, and some Led Zeppelin by request. We'll send that out  to the gang at the Centerport Deli. Yes. Yeah. My hometown deli. Been in there a million  times and those guys don't even know it. I used to go jet skiing out there by Ash Roken  on Long Island. It's great, man. I had fun. That was when I used to be able to have fun.  I know. When I had no responsibility. Well, you don't have any responsibility. What's  our responsibility? No, I mean, as you get a little older, especially, well, when you're 
[00:43:30]  married, Opie, maybe someday you'll grow up a little bit. I don't want to get married  ever. Ever, ever, ever. But my parents are trying to figure out why I'm not married yet  because I don't want to be married. Simple as that. I mean, at some point, though, you get  this little bit of responsibility that comes over. I'm still a third grader. Don't get  me wrong. But I wouldn't, like I did years ago, I would get a credit card and I'd put  a jet ski on it. I swear to God, I don't care. But now it's like, oh my God, I wouldn't 
[00:44:00]  even dream of doing that. I know. You look at your monthly statement, you're like, oh,  how am I ever going to pay this off? I like that commercial. If you don't, with the credit  cards, if you don't pay your credit card bills, you won't have anything left to, I can't  remember. I don't remember that at all. Yeah. There's some guy sitting in his house and he's  got a bunch of cool stuff, TVs and stereos, and they all start going away. Oh, I thought 
[00:44:30]  that was the drug commercial. No. Where the TV goes up his nose and his car goes up his nose  and the couch goes up his nose. Yeah, that's another one. Right, right, the drug one. No,  this one was credit cards. Like, if you don't pay your credit card bill, all your stuff will  get taken away. And I learned that. Yeah, that's a real effect. Really? Well, they took my  car once. The car you were living out of? Yeah. I actually was living out of my car at one  point. I had an old Chevy Monza. I was styling. And I went through GMAC, General Motors 
[00:45:00]  Acceptance Corporation. Sure. That, I decided, turned into get me Anthony's car. After a  while. And I was hiding it. It was like chess. And they came to my job once. Uh-huh. I was  working out in Hopog. And this big burly guy comes and goes, I'm taking your car. I was  like, oh, please don't take my car. I'll give you the money tomorrow. I swear, I swear to  God, I'll give you the money tomorrow. And he had to call his boss, went through this big  thing. And he goes, all right, but I'm coming back tomorrow. And I am taking the money or 
[00:45:30]  the car. Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. He left. I quit the job. Because  I figured I could get another job with the car. But I couldn't get the job without the  car. Right. So I would have lost the job either way. Now, you were living out of your car.  Yeah. Where do you park it to sleep? I always wanted to know that. Either the train station  parking lot was a good thing. Oh, very good. In Greenlawn. Okay. Or I would park it in  my work parking lot in Hopog. And then I would, like, shower at my brother's house or something 
[00:46:00]  or a friend's house. Well, why didn't your brother? He lived in a shoebox too. Oh. It  was like, you know, a transitional period between getting heaved out of mom's house and having  to decide, hey, I better do something. Now, why did you get heaved out of mom's house? We  got to learn about you today. Well, we were getting, you know, I was, I guess, 20 or so,  maybe 19, 20. And she had already raised us enough. You know, the old man cut out and went 
[00:46:30]  to California. So she had to work and she decided, you know something, I'm getting a little  tired of this. So you guys leave. I have to live my life. You guys leave. You know. Very  nice. She gave us like a month's notice. It was great. Yeah. Thanks, mom. All right. You  guys should be on Jerry Springer. Oh, no, no. No. Yeah. We got past that. Very nice.  Yeah. All right. We were going to play the interview of the guy that got hurt at the  Million Youth March. Do we still have time or? Do we? Oh, no. We got to do this and then 
[00:47:00]  do that. Oh, a lot of things get in the way here. Wow. All right. We'll try to get the  exclusive interview with the guy that got hurt at the Million Youth March this past Saturday.  If you haven't heard the interview yet, it's intriguing. Tragic. Tragic. Yes. Pretty intense.  Yeah. And we'll get to him next. Also, on the way, I guess we could get some Creed on  the radio. We'll play like Creed and we'll come back real fast. How's that? Good. All  right. 1027 WNEW. The Rock of New York. The latest from Creed off there. My own prison 
[00:47:30]  CD. What's this life for? That CD went double platinum. People are buying that all over the  ball field. So if you're looking for something new to check out, that CD, I hate to say it,  but it rocks, Anthony. It rocks. Go ahead. I just want to say hi to a Greg from Clifton,  New Jersey. He says, I send you tons of messages and I'm a huge fan of the show, but all you  do is read the messages from the people that think you suck. Well, it's kind of true. And  we know we have some faithful listeners out there now and we totally appreciate it. But 
[00:48:00]  I think it's just more fun putting the people on the air that just don't like  us. Yeah. It's kind of fun to hear, hey, you know, you rock. Yeah. I've been listening  for 20 years and I am appalled by this pair of morons that you have spewing their filth  on at three o'clock. Oh, we call today sex perverts. No. What was it? Perverts. Perverts  and animals. And sex in there. Something. Yeah. Whatever. Lady took time away from watching 
[00:48:30]  her Titanic video while eating ho-hos and with the lady died tribute song playing 24 hours  a day in our house to call us to tell us that she didn't like the show. So. Great. Yes,  Rick. It was actually perverted animals. Thank you. Right. Right. Perverted animals. Perverted  animals. Thank you. We appreciate that. Good. We're going to cut that up and make it into  our latest promo in a little while. So. Creed playing with fuel September 15th in Roseland 
[00:49:00]  and Matt Devote has more tickets to give away to that show tonight. Yes. When we get off  the air here. We're starting to run later and later every day. Do we get overtime at  N.E.W.? What are you kidding? We should just shut up. We're just happy when we come to the  studios. We're just happy when we come to the N.E.W. studios and the combination still  works for us. Yeah. Really. We're asking for overtime. Just kidding, boss. You know,  eventually we'll just have to go to eight is what I'm starting to think. Get like somebody's 
[00:49:30]  morning show. Yeah. Why not? But we got to play really fast and then we'll step aside  for Matt Devote. We had an exclusive interview with a guy that was at the Million Youth March  with Khalid Muhammad and Reverend Al and the cops and he got injured so bad that he's going  to be suing everyone. I'm glad we got to interview this guy. Yes. Exclusive interview from earlier  on the O.P. and Anthony show. </pre>
