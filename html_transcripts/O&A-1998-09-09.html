<pre> Crack off London Calling when I found that diddy back in the early 80s. I was pretty psyched for you  I don't know why that was like a hidden track on this CD. Does anyone know the story behind that?  I don't know hidden tracks were pretty new  But did the record company maybe just screw up and forgot to put that track 19 was train in vain  Maybe maybe it was pretty much the best song off. Well, London Calling was good Spanish bombs was good  Lost in the supermarket was really just accept it. Oh P. All right, except it for what it is. Yeah. All right  I could do that. It's Opie. It's Anthony and it's you guys listening, which we totally appreciate 
[00:30]
 I guess everyone's talking about Mark Maguire. So we should you know, give our two cents really fast  Yeah, yeah, I owe you 20 bucks. Yeah, where is my 20 bucks? I'll give it to you. I want it right now  I'll pay you I'm good for it. All right  I gotta get through an ATM Anthony wasn't convinced that Mark was gonna hit the homer last night and I was like no way  He's got to do it at home. I happen it  I thought it just seemed to storybook like real life doesn't happen like that. Yeah, it's the home field and you know 
[01:00]
 How cool was it that that was the shortest homer?  He hit all year long and no fans really got a chance at the ball. He hit it into a chuck hole  Yeah something. Yeah, like the space that he hid in wasn't that big not at all and the groundskeeper that little kid got it  Hysterical mr. Maguire. I got something that belongs to you. I  Stayed up to like 1230 watching the coverage. It just seemed like the whole thing was scripted. Yeah, you know, it was weird 
[01:30]
 It was like a movie. It was cool. I gotta admit it was really cool  And what I think is cool about this home of Mark Maguire thing  It brought the whole nation together for a positive reason true  Well, we all like start talking about one thing that has happened in the country. It's like the OJ verdict  Clinton's gonna make his apology speech, you know plane crash, you know, like the old days  You know everyone got together to watch the first land moon landing right or the first space shuttle mission  We haven't had one of those in a really long time and this Mark Maguire thing kind of brought the country together the last few days 
[02:00]
 But we could go about the business of hating each other today. Yeah, that's fine. I get right back to it  Yeah, if Sammy Stokes and Mark Maguire could get along why can't everyone else we are the world?  I just like the fact I gotta take my hat off to the  announcers  Because they just shut their mouths. He hit the home run runs around the bases  He starts doing his little thing and the announcers shut up 
[02:30]
 Yes, which was great because I the worst thing is watching a historic moment like that and you have to hear  The home run that will stand out in the annals of  History, you know Mark Maguire must be feeling really good right about now. There he is holding his  Yeah, we can see and think for ourselves  Yeah, shut up. They just called the homer really fast and then they didn't talk for five minutes and it was great  I completely enjoyed that part of that work that worked very good. Thank you. So there we go 
[03:00]
 We move on but it's really funny if Sammy Stokes ends up beating Maguire  You know yesterday didn't mean anything really well the breaking of the record was a big thing  Yeah, it doesn't matter where it ends up. I think the actual breaking of the Maris record was pretty big. Yeah, cool  I watched yeah, that's what's weird. You watched your wife watch. Yeah. Yeah, cuz you guys are a huge  I mean you guys are Yankee fans. You'll have the Yankee game  I'm not gonna want a Cardinals game 
[03:30]
 You're not gonna go out of your way to watch the Cardinals Cubs on a Tuesday night  No, you know and that's what was so special about this moment. Everyone checked it out. Yes. So alright  What do you got today?  2757 1027 that's the phone line. Wow, you guys are already ringing the phone. That's cool  Facts is that you could be it could be sent to 212 957 w-a-w. I'm punching this up right now  W-a-w.com and instant email us people are really starting to dig the instant feedback 
[04:00]
 Getting email on that. They think it's a really cool thing that they could comment instantly on anything  We're talking about on the radio. Yeah, so make sure you do that  Take advantage of that on the way. We got seven married three and the who next  1027 w-a-w the Iraq of New York with the Brian Setzer Orchestra jump-jiving well from the dirty boogas  He did it's opiate Anthony. Hello, very very sad day today. Why is it sad?  Well, I should say it's emotional day today. Why why well our pal Marv Albert got married got married 
[04:30]
 Who is this woman?  She's standing by him was standing by him  Better not stand in front of them. She's been around bitten  Yeah, Marv got married today and he's gonna be back on TV starting next week a little else  So yeah, I think it would be very nice to have a haunting tribute to tomorrow today. I hope you Anthony show  What do you think Anthony sure?  Check it out on any W 
[05:00]
 1027 w-a-w the right of New York with the bare naked ladies one week  We got to get the curses out of that then we'll put it on the air I guess  Some lady didn't like our Marv Albert tribute song. She found a very offensive open. Yes, because that song was  Intended for Lady died as she said. Yeah, that song is the lady died. I guess she forgot about Marilyn  All right. Well, I got to get the curses out. We'll put that on the air. People are so close-minded. I laugh at close-minded people 
[05:30]
 Close-minded people  All right, we're really not prepared here because we were just yelling at a lady for the last ten minutes  So she probably got all the lady died dolls and all the memorabilia. They've been selling over the past year  You know talking to these rubes like her. Mm-hmm. I need my ladies. I look a lady died plate for $29  I got a cent for it  It shows how much I love her  Oh  Okay  Well life well, it's Opie and Anthony instead of sitting on your ass 
[06:00]
 Worshipping lady die. Why not get out a little maybe maybe take up a couple of the causes that she took up  That would be nice. You know, maybe that would put a little energy behind this  Fascination that you have with the woman. Yes  And why don't you worship mother Teresa who did a lot more why Opie? You know why cuz she was an ugly old woman  That's the truth yeah  Why do you think no one cared when when she died right because she is an ugly wrinkled dirty old woman who kissed 
[06:30]
 People's feet in Calcutta instead of the well-dressed. Yeah. I did you see an auction for that gunny sack  That she wore no options every other week for all lady dies stuff  Oh, it's the bull beret lady guy war in our hair. Oh, I gotta pay six billion dollars for it  Where's where's the gunny sack and that little tablecloth she wore over her shoulder  Yeah, and on her head and the funerals of the two people were  Basically different, you know, I know I couldn't tell the difference between the two 
[07:00]
 I it was the lady die funeral with the pomp and circumstance and guns and and soldiers all well-dressed and the casket being paraded  and then there was a bumpy ride and  I  Think she almost bounced out of the casket five times and it was a wooden casket and it was uncovered  Yeah, you just saw like her she was melting in the Sun  It looked like yeah, but no one remembers her it's ladies like the one we just talked to well 
[07:30]
 Well, we'll have you put a little piece of that on the air. Well, you'll have the curses out  So this woman's mentality. Yeah, it's brilliant actually to be honest with you. Yes. I learned something from that lady today  So did I 212 757 1027 if you got anything to add to this mess  We call the opium Anthony show or if you want to fax this 212 957 WNEW  Anything coming in through the feedback yet? No, okay. Very good. Thanks for your support. We appreciate it on the way  We got Dave the news stay there 
[08:00]
 WNEW the Rock of New York with Tom Petty from into the great wide open CD Cheryl Crowe's ladies before that my favorite mistake off her  New CD the globe sessions. Good afternoon. It's Opie  It's Anthony and we got a lady on the line here who did not like Anthony your Marv Albert tribute song  I don't care. It was very very touching song. I thought of course it's okay, you know that  I don't even care. I think she didn't even really listen to the words. She's offended because you used 
[08:30]
 Goodbye  Norma Jean yeah candle in the wind right use the karaoke to that to sing about Marv Albert and she thinks that song should be  for Lady Di  One talk to this mess. Yeah, hi any W  I am an absolute shock as to the song that just plays to the tune of  Goodbye English Rose. Oh  Yes, the Marv Albert tribute. It was haunting wasn't it? Why did you play? What do you mean?  Don't you think that that was very offensive to play on the air? Why was it offensive? 
[09:00]
 Wait your man because that song was originally done for Princess Diana  Are you smoking crank?  First of all that song was done for Marilyn Monroe  Originally get it through your thick skull. I think that you are being very very unprofessional  You're not accepting my call. Hey, the president is putting cigars up girls anatomy. We could do anything  He's the figurehead of the country. Yeah, we're on the air. He's the figurehead of this country and he's 
[09:30]
 Well, he's the top of the heap and if he's doing that we could do whatever we want  I'm just curious again  So I was chosen and every time I even hear the film I as millions and millions of people think of  Princess Diana  You are a loser 
[10:00]
 Diana my name is Opie and this is Anthony and you can write all your complaint letters you want to CBS radio  You're a you're a loser. You know what you are. Go ahead. I've heard it all you are a perverted  Okay  I'm very  You're right. I am a shame  Yeah, that's exactly right 
[10:30]
 The way you're talking you're insane you think that song is for Lady Di  Did they not play it at her funeral for Marilyn Monroe?  He just revamped a few words. It was originally from Marilyn Monroe and then it was  By the same person that was asked to sing it on people dying car crashes every day  I want to ask you. I'm just a little bit a lot more than Lady Di  How could you even put the garbage on the air because people enjoy it?  Anything else I got to move on with the radio show here 
[11:00]
 Anything else I got to move on with the radio show the whole world doesn't revolve around children  Let's put Barney on the air 24 hours a day. It'll be a perfect world  Do me a favor and stop listening to our radio show. You're not allowed stop the channel right now. Thank you  I hung up on it enough of her Dunskey Wow  Perverted sick animal. Yeah, that's what she said. She's probably the same woman that is totally behind Bill Clinton  I think it's time to move on we've heard too much of this 
[11:30]
 perverted sick animal  Another hypocrite. Well, I don't even want to deal with people like that. Don't don't call anymore those people  Had it it gets my juices flowing. Oh, I love that stuff on the way we got rush and Harvey Danger stay there and  EW  Anthony this just in yes, Lady Di was a crack whore. Oh my god. I didn't read that  It's coming across on the AP wire Lady Di was a crack whore 
[12:00]
 What oh two seven w-a-w the Rock of New York with Harvey Danger  What oh two seven w-a-w the Rock of New York with Green Day and Sophie it's Anthony  Hey, did you notice the Green Day song they were playing yesterday when Mark McGuire made his loop around the field?  No, what was it? They were playing good riddance. Oh really hope you had the time of your life  I just heard when he would come up to bat they would play welcome to the jungle. That was pretty cool. Yeah  Interesting and I was kind of a wimpy homer yesterday. Yeah, he got the job done. That's all it takes 
[12:30]
 That's the go over the fence. It was so cool  I'm still just thinking about that moment all day long here today pretty neat. Yeah, so alright  Well, did they find the coward yet? I'm looking I'm watching New York one and they're showing footage of the million youth March. Well, how do  The first lie about that. Let's just get it out of the way. It was like the 3,500  Person March wasn't it? Yeah pretty much. I think they had 4,000 people there  Like that and Khalid Muhammad he's all brave, you know spewing his hate the black Hitler and now the cops are looking for him 
[13:00]
 And what is Khalid doing?  He's hiding there's your leader boys and girls. What a brave man. He is  No, that's it. Martin Luther King never hid from no one. He didn't speak like Khalid Muhammad either Malcolm X wouldn't hide  Occasionally he spoke like Khalid Muhammad. Yeah, he did but that was the early Malcolm X years  He's a coward though. Yeah, so there's a there's still trying to figure out who started a little melee at the end of the million youth 
[13:30]
 March the other day. Uh-huh cops say it was Khalid and his and his boys up on stage  Yeah  spewing hate and trying to incite a riot and Khalid insists that the cops moved in too soon and then started trouble. Well  Like I was saying I mean if you have a parade or a meeting and you're all organized and it's not hate-filled  Maybe the cops will give you five ten minutes to clean up after years your little 
[14:00]
 What is that called that they give you a permit?  After you the time that your permit says you're supposed to be off the street  You think the cops after hearing take the cops guns and shoot the police you think they're gonna sit there and go, you know  It's four but give Khalid 10 15 more minutes. All right  No, I just want to see where he's going with this  Yeah, maybe he'll say that you know get your own guns and start shooting the cops  Yeah, what the heck?  Storm up there at four o'clock  Not gonna wait and see what happens. It was getting ugly besides the Al Sharpton float hasn't gone by yet 
[14:30]
 Yeah, the big inflatable Al float was hung up in the trees because of the wind  Why why why why I got hung up in the trees my big float?  I come with a woodpecker don't get hung up in the trees, but my big fat ribbon out float get hung up in the tree  We had out on the show yesterday and he was explaining exactly what happened at the million youth march on Saturday  Yeah, this cleared a lot up. Let's go to this again from yesterday 
[15:00]
 All right, I'll speak to your mind what's wrong what's wrong  Mohammed was upset cause the police did not have to move in honor  The police should have been at the mayor's house  Why the mayor's house because at the very time we was having the march the mayor was sexually assaulted to wanna  Barley  Absolutely, the mayor and the police commissioner was sexually assaulted to wanna Barley 
[15:30]
 That is so wrong and you know it absolutely  But the police felt it was more important to stop Khalid Mohammed from speaking about beanie babies  That's all he was talking about beanie baby  But while the mayor and the police commissioner and Alfonso Mato are sexually assaulted to wanna Barley  They felt they had to break up our little beanie baby quilting me cause we was also quilting 
[16:00]
 You were quilting out there quilting be beanie baby  Conversation while governor Pataki and Pat Moynihan are selling crack to second graders  We was having a quilting be  Discussing beanie babies and the police stormed the stage Khalid Mohammed even said excuse me sir  May we have five more minutes while I make this last stitch and the police went crazy beating everybody  Beat me right over the head if it weren't for my hair processing. I'd be injured right now 
[16:30]
 I have bulletproof hair  You sure do Al  So until this is investigated I will keep fighting  Cause to wanna Barley was sexually assaulted by the mayor police chief the Easter Bunny and the Loch Ness Monster  No justice no peace no justice no peace  All right, I'll get out of here. I think they're dishonest  Love it 2027 WNEW the Rock of New York with tragically hip that's poets off the Phantom Power CD 
[17:00]
 Sounds a little bit like the stones when they were doing their thing in the 80s  Yeah, and then we had the stones before that from tattoo you waiting on a friend. It's opi. It's Anthony  I'm on the way. There's a guy on the line  Yeah, that got hurt at the million youth march and he will be suing everyone  Really? He's gonna sue everyone and we're gonna talk to him. Yes  He's gonna give us the exclusive and we're gonna put him on the air in about 20 minutes great 
[17:30]
 So I'm psyched things are starting to happen here. We're getting more and more exclusives for the open Anthony show, okay?  All right. What else we're gonna do today on the show? Um  What do we have plans for later? I want to talk about peewee. Okay, we can do that and  I heard some on the news, you know that Swiss air thing pretty tragic horrible horrible  You know anybody that's connected with the relatives of it. It's a tarp. Yes, and  It brings out something in human nature that I don't understand  Did need for this horrible sorrow and everything when people when people die 
[18:00]
 You know you go to a funeral and do you because I heard today that they're gonna have a bunch of sixth graders  Lay a wreath at the site and sing lean on me  Now what is there a reason to have a heart-wrenching scene like that?  I think it makes the victims families feel a little better about the tragic better  How does anything like that make you feel better you mourn you do what you have to do?  But then to drag yourself to these memorials and this isn't just the Swiss air thing 
[18:30]
 I mean, this is when anybody dies and your family or whatever  Why do you have to go for weeks of these?  Like the wake the wakes gotta last for a week and then the funeral and then you got to go to the church and and  You go to these services. I went to service last week and his bagpipes playing  Yeah, you're fine and then the bagpipes start playing and you lose it. Yeah, is it necessary?  Some people that's the way they mourn. I mean, can we make it any sad? 
[19:00]
 Let's get the sixth graders to sing lean on me and lay a wreath  Can we play the final scene of the Titanic on a big screen too?  Just to stir it up a little more, you know in our family when someone dies, it's a huge party. Is it?  Yeah, it really is see those are good unless it's a tragic death. God forbid knock on wood  But in general, there's more jokes being thrown around the room  Yeah, well then that's usually with with a lot of things to to loosen up the mood  But yeah, they usually start out at these 
[19:30]
 Yes, they just bring it down. I don't think the sixth graders should be singing lean on me  Oh, you know what? They're gonna sound like the real high little kitty voices. Give me the heebie-jeebies  Yeah, that that brings back a memory when we had a deal with the cancer kids and they were singing Christmas songs  Oh my god. Oh, I mean I I was I was dying  I don't even know how we tell people this we mean and believe I've done a lot for charity  I know it's hard to believe but we do it under the  Like blanket of the veil of the dark. I know that night. We're caped crusaders 
[20:00]
 I think it's because we really feel guilty about our radio show  We just don't want to go to hell so we're trying to know that good luck to even the odds  But we do do a lot of charity and we ended up in this situation once where we had a children's hospital  For kids with cancer and it was near Christmas time and it was a great scene  There was a great scene all these kids were hanging around and they were singing Christmas carols  There's no joke here by the way late. No, this is just the way it was a taste of reality  And we're like me and Anthony are really touch like this is really cool 
[20:30]
 They're all singing on key and the counselors are sing along with the kids  Yeah, and then I go outside because I was getting like well  This is intense and somebody who works in the hospital goes, you know  Most of these kids will not make it to Christmas. Oh  My holy did I need to hear that?  It was just like oh my it was horrible. I know very sad horrible  Yeah, I think people some people like being sad. I really like being sad 
[21:00]
 Hmm, if it's for the right reasons  You know, like I like I'm a happy guy. I like being happy but I also like I like being depressed  You like being depressed sometimes because as long as I know like I'm gonna get out of it man  I have a dark side, but as long as I know I'm gonna get out of the depression  I really enjoy wallowing maybe it makes the highs seem that they make them that much better  Yeah  as long as you realize that life is like a lot of ups and downs like a roller coaster and  You know, you're gonna have those ups you're in it for the long haul. You're in it for the long haul 
[21:30]
 Exactly. So as long as you could understand that you're depressed you're down, you know things really don't look good for  You but as long as you know that it's gonna go up eventually  It's kind of fun to wallow in that depression see my emotions. I like putting them through like a voltage regulator  It gets the spikes out, you know, keep it straight. I don't like being too happy  I don't like being too sad  Well, that's that's what scares me too  Cuz if things are going really well in my life and I get a lot of highs in a row I'm like 
[22:00]
 Oh, here you come. What the hell is around the corner?  Who is gonna just  Put that knife in my back and twist hard cuz you know it's coming  All right, but we got that that person that's gonna be suing everyone  That got hurt in the million youth March and if you want to add something to the show phones are a little light today  I think we've shocked some people.

I tried just squeezing it thinking it would go away, but then my testicles blew up like hoppity hops 
[31:30]
 I just can't get rid of it. I took five pills and it's what it's out of control  I know it's on a mission. I I look like good. My name should be tyrone  Yeah, we're gonna have to wait out the storm I think my wife ran away she was frightened  It was so big. You see couldn't get wet at niagara falls 
[32:00]
 She's like 70 years old and she hasn't seen a a monster like that since  The kaiser was in charge over in germany. It's like a big blood sausage  I know you ever see those are like fairs  Big blood sausage is what I got. It's turning purple. It's like I got an eggplant between my legs  I would go to the er  Er i'll take care of it. Yeah  I need a bun for my blood sausage. I think so. Maybe a nurse could take care of that one for me 
[32:30]
 I think so. I don't think i'll fit in the ambulance quite frankly  They might slam it in the rear door. Uh, they could push up on top  I look funny laying on a gurney covered with a blanket. It looked like a tp  For crying out loud, it's you  Okay, well I would go there. Oh, thank you for your  For your help, mr. Pharmacist, please. No problem. Thank you, please. Bye  There he goes 
[33:00]

I mean, you know some parts of canada where we're up to 90 degrees today. Yeah 
[33:30]
 That's encouraging. Isn't that weird? That is strange and then we're like in the 60s  Why aren't you wearing a long sleeve shirt today like everyone else anthony? You won't see me in a long sleeve shirt  Uh until probably february february. That's when I start realizing  And it's winter isn't it? I'm like one of those dopes that just i'm in a t-shirt freezing. Yeah, anthony  It's winter. I i'm i'm the guy soon as november hits. I put long johns on  Do you i'm i'm a wimp. I don't like long johns. No, no, he's uncomfortable 
[34:00]
 Why are we talking about bundle? Yeah, let's get off this  Just a funny time for that. Yeah, we have plenty of months to talk about that stuff, but uh,  See in the post today  Peewee herman is coming back once again. Oh, yeah, let me see this  Controversial why they call him controversial comedian peewee herman. Yeah, well listen, he's controversial  What I don't understand is he whipped out a batch in a porno theater years ago what he did  Is tame compared to what uh our president is doing so can we please put peewee herman back on tv? 
[34:30]
 We need good tv once again, right? He loses his job on a kiddie show  Uh for doing it in a porno theater. Yes. Oh not the oval office, right?  And the president is you know, i'm sorry. I apologize watching monica  But uh cigars and uh, yes is where the sun don't shine and and he's still our president  This is the country we live in. This is great. This is awesome. Uh, something as important as a kiddie show host  Yeah, he's coming back. He's gonna probably uh be the main guy in cabaret 
[35:00]
 They're trying to get him on broadway for that rolling cabaret that uh, joel gray immortalized in the movie  Yes, the movie with lisa monelli. They kind of look uh similar actually if you look at the picture side by side  Yeah, that whole makeup thing the white face and the slick back hair  lipstick  peewee thinking  Don't fit the spanking your bone in your room 
[35:30]
 Come on come on to where i whip it out and play come at the cabaret. Oh chum  Come at the cabaret  Sherry conkey  The secret word today boys and girls is splooge  When every year the word splooge spanking real hard  Good  Very nice peeway very nice. So we look forward to seeing peewee herman 
[36:00]
 Hey, what do you think of president clinton?  Oh phil clinton, yeah  Seems he can spank it  But I can't  Doesn't seem very fair does it well he wasn't spanking it  I think if he was spanking it then you know, there wouldn't be a problem. It's not like I put anything in mr. Vaughn  On my show mr. Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn 
[36:30]
 Sit down. Let me take a cigar and and assault you with it  All right, very good good commentary from uh  Yeah  I'm gonna faint. Yeah, it's very good  Okay, thank you you're welcome thanks for coming by today 
[37:00]
 All right, two one two seven five seven one two seven if you got something to add  Can someone get rid of peewee? I replace  Fact light is two one two nine five seven w. Any w on the way. We got the latest  Uh  Two seven w. Any w the rock of new york with billy idol. It's opi and anthony  Hey, will they stop showing footage of the million youth march the melee that occurred at the end of it? 
[37:30]
 That's all tv is showing today. Yeah, there's two things that i've seen on this tv above us mark  Maguire's homer, which i've now seen officially  358 times  It was cool, but now I I think I got it in my brain. Yeah, the visual is there  Yes, I could go to different camera shots in my head. Yeah, I think so. I need a director  I don't need to see it anymore. I I got it all in my brain for eternity 
[38:00]
 I do believe I even got the moment when he pointed to the sky  I got when he jumped in the stands and he hugged the maris family. I got it all in my brain  I got the point where he almost missed first base and the coach pointed at it and had to turn around and step on  I got it all in my head. I don't need to see it anymore. It was a great fabulous moment for sports  But we don't need to see it anymore. Do we what do you think he was saying to the maris family?  Put his arms around him and like tucked his head in there. I know what he said like 
[38:30]
 I beat your father  He said no go home and get a life  No, i'm just kidding. That's my spotlight guy go home right  No  And then they're showing the uh the melee yeah at the million youth march, you know  We're getting a lot of requests. Uh for that exclusive we had earlier  Oh, yes, maybe we could play it before we got to get out of here  But we actually had an interview with a guy who was hurt at the million youth march and he's suing everyone 
[39:00]
 Yeah, it sounded tragic sounded very very sad. This injury sounded pretty serious  Yeah, so maybe we could get that interview on again before seven o'clock before matt devote steps in we'll do that  All right. Also a lot of people want to hear the marv albert song again. Really? Yeah, they do  Well, the the reason we broke it out today is because marv albert got married. Yes  Yes  I accept this woman as my lawfully wedded wife. Yes  Yes, now bear your ass so I may bite it 
[39:30]
 Yes  That honeymoon imagine that oh that's scary. They go on the honeymoon. What's this woman thinking?  I don't know. He takes off his hair. Yeah, honey. Let me take off my hair  Who threw the bouquet didn't marv was he wearing the gown?  Could you see that all this money comes out and he's wearing the wedding with the garters and stuff. Yes  Yes, what a snazzy little ensemble i'm wearing. Yes 
[40:00]
 He's got it on under his uh, his suit. I I do believe but  I don't like it instead of the veil you like push his hair back over his head and you can he can bite the bride  What a sick scene that's gotta be. I I honestly like marv a lot and i'm marv  And you know, uh, well i'm kind of hypocritical. I guess  Why I just thought of something  Well, I think the president should leave office for what he has done  But I think marv belongs on tv because he's a great sportscaster now  I think that's hypocritical from I don't think so because I don't think a sportscaster 
[40:30]
 Uh, his moral morals and scruples are very important  Yeah, I don't care what he does if he does his job, right?  But part of doing his job isn't his morality and his judgment part of the president's job  Absolutely his judgment. Yeah, if nothing else what bill clinton did  Shows a man with a bad judgment  That is bad judgment  I think I have a problem because he lied to the american people even beyond all that 
[41:00]
 As far as being the president of the united states lying to the people. Hey, you know something  You might even still be able to run the country. Yeah as as a liar. You probably do it pretty good  You're doing real well, but it shows his lack of judgment  Doing what he did in the oval office and you need judgment to uh run the presidency very good  That's it now marv, you know  Well, I don't know who cares what he's doing on his off time 
[41:30]
 I simply want him back because i'm a huge hoops fan and bob costas just didn't cut it in the mba finals this year  Now that was horrible. It was a great contrast what we saw last night when maguire hit the home run  And you you just see the crowd  Hear the crowd and the sportscasters kept their mouths shut  There was no what a thrilling day for sport and baseball  Maguire takes the field look at him waving here. He is picking up his son as he goes over and hugs the maria 
[42:00]
 Hey, hey, hey shut up. We see I can see i'm watching just shut up  It's much more dramatic when they just showed the scene for five minutes right night. So and bob costas  Was horrible, uh during the the the finals of jordan. Yeah  Jordan this could be it  This could be the last time we ever ever see michael jordan. Oh my god. Did you see the shot that?  Yeah, we saw and we're watching and we're just shut up and we'd be able to concentrate more if you would just shut up 
[42:30]
 Yeah now marv knew how to handle it. Very good. All right, so we want to play the marv albertson again  Yes, yes in honor of marvin bedding. Yes  Um, the funny thing is to the faithful listeners out there every time we play this song  We tick off a lot of older ladies because they're convinced that we're making fun of lady die  You figure it out. Who cares? I don't get that one, but maybe someone out there can explain that one to us  Here's the marv albert song on n. E w  1027 w n. E w the rock of new york with the verb bittersweet symphony eve 6 before that with that catchy song inside out 
[43:00]
 And some lead zeppelin by request. We'll send that out to the gang at the center port delhi. Yes  Yeah, my hometown delhi been in there a million times and those guys don't even know it  I used to go jet skiing out there by ashroken on long island. It's great man. That's fun  That was when I used to be able to have fun. I know what when I had no responsibility  We don't have any responsibility. What's our responsibility? No, I mean as you get a little older 
[43:30]
 I especially well when you're married opi, maybe someday you'll grow up a little bit  I don't want to get married ever ever ever ever  But uh, my parents are trying to figure out why i'm not married yet because I don't want to be married  Simple as that. I mean at some point though you you get this little bit of responsibility  Comes over i'm believe no i'm still a third grader. Don't get me wrong  But uh, I wouldn't like I did years ago. I would get a credit card  And I put a jet ski on it. I swear to god. I don't care 
[44:00]
 But now it's like oh my god, I wouldn't even dream of doing that. I know you look at your monthly  Statement you're like, oh, yeah, how am I ever gonna pay this off?  I like that commercial if you don't uh with the credit cards if you don't pay your credit card bills  You won't have anything  Left to I can't remember. I don't remember that at all  Yeah, it's not there's some guy sitting in his house and he's got a bunch of cool stuff tvs and stereos and they all start going away 
[44:30]
 Oh, I thought that was the drug commercial no  No  Where the tv goes up his nose and his car goes up his nose and and the couch goes up  Yeah, that's another one right right the drug one  Now this one was credit cards like if you don't pay your credit card bills, you know  All your stuff get taken away. So and I learned that yeah, that's a real effect. Really?  Well, they took my car once when I was  The car you were living at? Yeah, I actually was living out of my car at one point. I had an old uh, chevy manza  I was styling 
[45:00]
 And I went through gmac. Yeah general motors acceptance  Corporation sure that I I decided turned into get me anthony's car  After a while  And I was hiding it was like chess  And uh, they came to my job once. Uh, I was working out in hop hog  And this big burly guy comes and goes i'm taking your car. I was like, oh, please don't take my car  I'll give you the money tomorrow. I swear I swear to god i'll give you the money tomorrow  And he had to call his boss went to this big thing and he goes all right  But i'm coming back tomorrow and i'm taking the money or the car. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you 
[45:30]
 Thank you. He left I quit the job  Because I figured I could get another job with the car, but I couldn't get the job without the car  Right, so I would have lost the job either way now you were living out of your car  Yeah, where do you park it to sleep? I always want to know that. Um either the uh train station parking lot  Was a good thing good in green lawn, okay, or I would park it, uh in my work parking lot in hop hog  Um, and then I would like shower at my brother's house or something or a friend's house 
[46:00]
 Well, why didn't your brother let he was having what he lived in a shoe box, too  It was it was like, you know a transitional period between getting heaved out of uh mom's house and having to decide hey  I better do something now. Why did you get heaved out of mom's house? We gotta learn about you today  Well, I we were getting you know, I was uh, I guess 20 or so maybe 1920 and she had already  Raised us enough  You know the old man cut out and went to california 
[46:30]
 So she had to work and she decided, you know something i'm getting a little tired of this  So you guys leave I have to live my life you guys leave, you know, very nice  She gave us like a month's notice.
