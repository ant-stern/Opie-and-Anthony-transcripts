<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a montage portraying them as "shock jocks" and "controversial radio personalities," immediately followed by chaotic audio suggesting a physical altercation or prank involving Opie, Anthony, and someone named Roland, and then a brief technical issue with the music intro.  The hosts then discussed an unannounced mandatory staff meeting at KROQ (despite broadcasting from New York City), speculating wildly on its purpose.  This segment contrasted good news (high ratings in Buffalo and Rochester) with the bad news that their show was ending on WJFK in Washington, D.C. due to scheduling conflicts.  Anthony explained his previous day's absence due to severe gastrointestinal issues, dismissing online rumors of a suspension.  They recounted a surprisingly conversational phone interview with Sylvester Stallone, discussing his career and his feelings about *Copland*.  The show also included a recounted interview with radio legend Bob Grant, featuring a humorous moment where Grant requested an absent Anthony to do a Bob Grant impression.  News headlines discussed Bin Laden's son's peace plea, a tiger attack possibly provoked by the victim, and graphic, crudely humorous commentary on allegations against Randy Moss involving a finger injury during a sexual encounter.  A Packers fan with a Patriots helmet tattooed on his head was also discussed, as was the death of Bobby Fischer.  The segment ended with a tense, ultimately reassuring interaction with their program director, Tom, who confirmed the staff meeting was "a good meeting," followed by further speculation and humorous banter, and the mention of a planned comedy benefit for a deceased friend.  The entire segment was punctuated by extensive coarse language and sexually explicit humor.


The next segment began with a caller whose loud radio caused interference. The hosts then launched into a scathing, joking condemnation of Staten Island, referring to it as a "dirt bridge" to New Jersey.  A caller debated police fitness requirements, referencing the ADA and Morgan Spurlock's documentary on compulsive eating.  The discussion included a news story about a man who rammed his car into a McDonald's over a wrong order, further negative caller commentary on Staten Island (described as a "toxic wasteland"), and McDonald's' response.  A caller from Boston who passed a police physical ability test despite weighing 300 pounds shared his experience, followed by an HR manager explaining the complexities of obesity and employment law, particularly the ADA.  A caller then made racist and unfounded claims about Staten Island's population, followed by "FU Friday" messages. The hosts speculated about the disappearance of frogs in Staten Island, and announced the upcoming in-studio guest appearance of the *Cloverfield* cast.  The segment featured discussion of *Cloverfield*'s fluctuating Rotten Tomatoes score and opinions on film critic Jeffrey Lyons.  A Brooklyn caller described Staten Island, leading to a bizarre discussion of a supposedly large albino community there, involving claims of nocturnal activity and child abduction.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to Britney Spears' reported multiple personality disorder, speculation about a pregnancy, and "perv switches," leading to a news story about an oral surgeon charged with sexually assaulting patients under anesthesia and speculation on his defense. A mysterious, unidentified sound clip was played before a brief discussion with the *Cloverfield* cast about the film, including its shaky camerawork, marketing, and low-budget effects. The mystery sound clip remained unidentified at the segment's end.


The *Cloverfield* cast interview explored the film's secretive production, including code names ("Cheese," "Chocolate Outrage"), the printing of 10,000 posters with the original title "Monstrous," and comparisons to *The Mist*.  The actors discussed special effects, character development, previous roles (including a humorous anecdote about one actor working with Arlie Ermey), the possibility of a sequel, and reactions to the film's release and early reviews, including a negative *New York Times* review. The interview included discussions of the actors’ personal lives and dating experiences, and an anecdote about one actor's encounter with a Vancouver hooker.  During the interview, the hosts revealed, much to their surprise, that their station, K-Rock, was switching to a country music format. The segment concluded with a tribute to a departing colleague, Tom Chiasano, interspersed with jokes and humorous audio clips, followed by a discussion of a 911 call resulting in a woman's death due to dispatcher negligence, and a clip of isolated vocals from a David Lee Roth recording.


This segment focused on *Cloverfield*, contrasting New York City with other cities (with humorous, offensive descriptions of Milwaukee) as a setting for a monster attack.  The discussion shifted to the film's themes of reacting to unexpected catastrophe.  TJ Miller, a *Cloverfield* star, was a guest, recounting an amusing anecdote about Chris Pine on the *Star Trek* set, and discussing filming *Cloverfield*, including the use of rats and their short-term memory issues.  Other topics included a British Airways plane crash landing, the hosts' opinions on various TV shows (*Lost*, *The Wire*, *Entourage*, *Felicity*), Perez Hilton's website, the "two girls one cup" video, online pornography, and the future of their radio show. The segment concluded with an on-air haircut for Jim Norton and a continuation of the recurring "Mad Scientist and Epstein" bit.


The final segment opened with a discussion about a wheelchair-bound inventor and his partner's sexually explicit actions.  This transitioned into an in-studio interview with Travis's French Bulldog puppy, Dexter, with a pre-written one-sheet detailing his playful biting, love of kisses, and recent parasite infestation.  Dexter's arrival was less exciting than anticipated, prompting discussion of his cost ($2500), size, and breed.  His handlers then signaled it was time for him to leave.  Before concluding, the hosts again discussed the potential shift to country music at K-Rock, expressing skepticism and dissatisfaction.  They read several "runner-up" lines of the day and the winning line, a humorous analogy about laundry and color bleeding.  The segment ended with the hosts teasing and sniffing Dexter, making further jokes, and commenting on a co-host's haircut.  The hosts’ banter and comedic timing were emphasized throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to your socks?  I don't know what happened.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Mass Mass.  Do it now.  His skin is completely black.  Oh my God.  This is where entertainment is going.  Oh my God.  Is that backlighting?  Oh my God.  Oh, Roland's got a paddle.  Oh, my God, Roland's on him. 
[00:01:00]  Roland is kicking Dave's ass.  Who saw this?  They are sick.  Freeze.  One, two, three, go.  B-Rock is attempting.  Give us a thumbs up if you're all right.  Shut up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  What are you laughing at? 
[00:01:30]  The music was a half second late in starting.  I looked at Stan, and his finger just kind of pointed at E-Rock.  It's got to be queued up every day.  Half a second.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got to jump right into this.  That's Mardag.  We're all getting settled.  Settled in.  And Tim, who does a lot of the engineering around here, he's setting up a million mics 
[00:02:00]  for the cast of Cloverfield.  They're coming in.  Yeah.  And the movie continues to get good reviews.  Yeah.  Bunch of the papers today giving it three stars out of four.  Rotten Tomatoes in general giving it a very good review.  And we've got the cast coming in sometime this morning.  So we're going to talk to them.  So Tim's setting up the studio.  And pretty much, maybe a minute to two minutes before Ecstasy of Gold, at some of the stations  here, he goes, oh, by the way, looks at me, he goes, by the way, there's a staff meeting 
[00:02:30]  at nine o'clock today.  Mandatory.  Mandatory staff meeting at nine o'clock today for all the employees of this radio station,  KROQ, that we broadcast from here in New York City.  Yep.  I go, oh, that's not good.  Oh, no.  And Tim's been here a long time.  I go, Tim, in your humble opinion, what does that mean?  Yeah.  He goes, oh, that means something big is going down. 
[00:03:00]  So let the speculating begin.  I go, Tim, you've been here a long time.  Has there ever been a mandatory staff meeting where nothing has happened, where they just  maybe go around the room and give everybody lollipops and say, hey, you guys have been  doing such a great job for this radio station.  We just wanted to hand out lollipops and pat you on the back today.  They might do that, right?  You're like, hey, job well done.  Just want to let everyone know that. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, Tim, you're not going to get in trouble, are you?  How many years have you been at this fine radio station, KROQ?  21.  21 years.  21 years.  And when they have mandatory staff meetings, what usually happens?  Usually a major change in music or programming.  But there was once where they just brought us all in to congratulate us on a job well done.  Well, that ain't happening.  You never know.  We got a long ways to go before we get that meeting.  I mean, things are looking up around here, but. 
[00:04:00]  So you think that means something big is happening?  Yeah, but I'm not worried.  Well, you shouldn't be.  Exactly.  You've dodged many changes over the years.  I think it's.  And that's what he means by, you know, he's not worrying.  No, no.  It means it's not going to affect me.  I don't give a crap.  Is there a major, major change happening?  And I usually know.  I usually, for some reason, have, like, an idea.  I would be afraid.  But I'm not afraid today.  But a mandatory meeting for the entire staff.  New show coming in. 
[00:04:30]  Boozy, boozy, bop.  No one's really suspicious about the whole thing is that not one member of the O.P. and Anthony show knew about this mandatory, quote, staff meeting.  No.  Until Tim told us about four minutes ago, five minutes ago.  There was a couple of KROQ staff people who didn't know, too, because for some reason they weren't on the list.  Oh, there's a.  Wait, wait.  There's a list of who's to attend.  It's like two WXRK employees.  That's who the email went out to.  Huh?  Mm-hmm.  And not everybody made that list.  And you guys could have been just missed. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, aren't we subcontractors?  Yes, you are.  We are subcontractors.  But, you know, we do talk to Tom on a regular basis.  You know, maybe he would have said something.  Might have slipped his mind.  He's got a lot to think about.  Well, let the speculating begin.  But something is.  Yeah.  Something's in the air, huh?  Something's brewing.  What?  All good.  All good?  Yeah.  All right, get out of here, Tim.  Something's a-brewin'.  Right.  In other radio news really fast, it's a weird day for us, I guess. 
[00:05:30]  I'll start with the good news.  The ratings for Buffalo and Rochester came in.  Ooh.  And, oh, by the way, good afternoon to Rochester.  We barely acknowledged them.  And after the ratings we got in Rochester, maybe we should start saying hi to Rochester.  Fantastic.  And acknowledging that people are actually listening to this crap in Rochester, New York.  Thank you, Rochester.  Rochester did very, very well in the ratings.  Buffalo, everybody listening on the edge.  We did very, very well in the ratings for Buffalo.  That's the good news. 
[00:06:00]  The bad news, and it pains me to say this, this is our last day on WJFK in Washington.  Hi, Washington.  Bye, Washington.  Our last day on WJFK.  And we've been associated with WJFK for, I don't know, many, many years.  Yeah.  And it sucks, but quite frankly, there was no room for us.  Yeah.  Our show was just kind of thrown in the middle.  Like, we're heard, I think, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Washington, D.C. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, it's tape delayed and middays.  Oof.  Nah.  And when the junkies, you know, feel like going late, like we feel like going late when  we do our morning show, our show gets chopped up a bit.  And then it has a hard ending at 1 p.m.  In the middle of something, it'll just end.  And I'm not trying to make excuses.  This is some of the things that, you know, the listeners down there have been bitching  to me about, you know, that the show will just all of a sudden be in the middle of something  because, you know, the junkies go late, which is fine. 
[00:07:00]  They're a good show, and they're doing very well in Washington.  And it just sucks.  But I don't know.  I don't think we ever had a chance down there.  They got a nice lineup.  They got some good shows down there, and we were kind of just kind of squished in the  middle of this whole thing.  Yeah.  I think we were expected to perform in that slot, which most radio guys know.  It's just almost impossible.  Yeah, it's a tough one.  But middays, it's called middays, like 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
[00:07:30]  That's just a tough listen because most people are busy doing their work thing.  And for this type of radio, it's tough because, you know, a lot of people put music on.  Yeah.  I mean, it's better to have music in the background in an office setting than, like, a talk show  that you've got to, you know, pay attention to.  So, ah, it sucks.  Yeah.  I lost a little sleep last night because, you know, we've had a nice relationship with JFK  over the years.  So, we say goodbye to them today after today's show. 
[00:08:00]  And now we move on to Anthony.  How are you doing today, Anthony?  Oh, I'm feeling okay.  No, I'm feeling good.  Yeah?  Yeah, much better.  Everybody wants to know what happened to you yesterday.  Um, I think it was the fact that I mowed down a crap load of chicken and rice right  before I went to bed and, uh, it came right up.  And then my stomach did that thing where your legs feel like they're, um, on fire and you're 
[00:08:30]  getting cold sweats and, uh, you, you don't know what to do.  You're spinning around on the toilet like a dog chasing his tail.  You don't know which way to face.  And, uh, I woke up, uh, when the alarm went off, I felt okay.  And I stood up to go to the bathroom to get ready.  And it just hit me again, all woozy and, uh, just rocketing out both ends. 
[00:09:00]  What are you going to do?  It was awful.  You should have spun in a circle like a sparkler.  That's what I was doing, like one of those helicopters.  So it was, uh, it was really bad.  So I, I texted Steve.  I tried calling Ope, but Ope is, Ope is of the mindset.  I'm not turning my phone on until I'm leaving for work.  No, I'll tell you what's going on with me.  I got a secret phone that even my family, that doesn't, even my family doesn't have  the number to, only my, uh, my, my chick. 
[00:09:30]  She's the only one that has the phone number.  So if she's got some kind of issue, she could always get ahold of me.  But, but for everybody else, they're S out of luck.  Yeah.  I remember like we were supposed to sign contracts one night and, and, uh, the paperwork was  taken forever and ever and ever.  And it was really important.  We signed this contract that extremely important.  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, it was time for bed.  I got a set bedtime for the most part.  And when, when the clock hits around nine 30, I'm done. 
[00:10:00]  Turn off all phones and, and tough S for everybody.  Incommunicado.  And, uh, one time that almost hurt us because, uh, there were contracts being faxed and emailed  and I'm just snoozing away while everyone's trying to get ahold of me and all my phones  are off.  Doom and gloom, Bob, I got to get ahold of me.  Yeah.  Is there anybody that could go over there?  Can you call Kenny and he'll knock on the door?  I'm under the, I, you know, if you're, if you're a family member and, and you got a  little DWI or something crazy happens to you in the middle of the night, I'll find out about 
[00:10:30]  it in the morning.  I don't need to be woken up in that horrific way at three 34 o'clock in the morning.  You're the, give me the news in the morning guy.  Yeah.  Cause for the most part, you can't save anybody anyway.  You're just getting the news.  So why not get the news after a really good night's sleep?  Yeah.  Cause you know, you got to plan for funerals and all that stuff.  You got to have your energy and you got to be bushy tailed wide awake and bushy tailed.  I mean, the worst is to wake up in the middle of the night and have no sleep and now deal  with this horrific thing that, uh, is happening. 
[00:11:00]  Big shocker right at the moment.  So that's my philosophy.  Yeah.  I like that.  So there were rumors though, that, um, that I took the day off so I could phone in as Sylvester  Stallone.  You missed a great day.  That was a good one.  I know I was, I was listening.  Well, the reason I say you missed a great day was because, uh, you, you could have done  Bob Grant to Bob Grant.  I know.  By the way, when freaking Bob Grant, uh, yesterday asked, uh, Anthony to do his Bob Grant impression 
[00:11:30]  that he's heard wonderful things about, Jimmy and I were in a complete panic.  We looked at each other and Jimmy kind of gave me an eye and a look like I could do it.  And he did his Bob Grant impression and Bob Grant seemed to like it.  All right.  He goes, I can't do Bob Grant, but I, I've, I've heard over the years that you could do  Bob Grant.  Let me hear your Bob Grant.  And Jimmy and I are like, you know, cause I decided just F with the listeners yesterday 
[00:12:00]  that yes, that's the answer by the way.  Cause everyone was wondering, I like effing with the listeners.  That's right.  And then there was Anthony wasn't here and we decided not even to acknowledge it.  Didn't acknowledge it.  Uh, and then rumors started popping up on, uh, the message boards and, uh, pal talk and,  uh, uh, baby girl's a big liar.  Where she starts trouble and said that I was suspended for 30 days.  Nice.  And, um, that, that people believed it. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, I, I wouldn't say why I was suspended and then people speculated as to why I was suspended.  I said something racist was one of the things.  Yeah.  But, uh, who's in my house to hear that?  Uh, I, well, after the show, I went into Tom's office and he was in the middle of a very  important phone call.  It makes a little more sense.  Now something's definitely going on.  Oh, and all of a sudden he gets off the phone for a second and he goes, you guys did, you  know, well today.  I'm like, thanks.  He goes, but why didn't you mention, uh, Anthony at all this morning? 
[00:13:00]  I go, cause that's what I do.  And I go, have a nice day.  And we walked out.  What should I do?  What Jimmy did is Bob Grant and, uh, Bob Grant, uh, believed it.  And then you could have done freaking, you know, Rocky for Rocky.  We had Sylvester Stallone on the phone.  I heard him on the phone.  That was, uh, and you could have interviewed, uh, Sylvester Stallone as Sylvester Stallone.  Maybe bring up one of the old bits.  I want it.  About, uh, the, the glass top table with Mickey underneath it, which we used to get away with. 
[00:13:30]  Yes, we did.  The things we used to get away with.  Oh boy.  Yeah.  Click.  Yeah.  It heard.  Click.  That's okay though.  He was cool though, man.  He was really, I was, I was like really surprised at how conversational he was, but then like,  well, he's Stallone.  He's talked to a million.  What am I, an idiot?  Yeah.  That's just it.  It's not like a one word answers from him.  He knows how to do an interview, you know?  And, uh, what did he say about, uh, about Rambo?  Um.  Very excited about it, I heard. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's really psyched about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he said the studio didn't want to do Rocky.  It was cool.  We talked about Copland.  And, uh, it was interesting cause he said that, uh, cause I love Copland.  Everyone loves him in that.  Everyone.  Yeah.  And he goes, that one really hurt me because he was just saying how like it changed his  image.  I wish I would have known the movies he did right after cause I think it was probably  them that hurt him and not Copland.  You know what's so weird about that?  You would think nothing would hurt Sylvester Stallone's image.  Wow.  He said that hurt him cause he, yeah.  Oh yeah.  He said that hurt me.  Because everyone, you know, people didn't want to see him out of shape and fat and stuff like 
[00:14:30]  that.  But it was like the most, the most critically acclaimed, uh, performance he's ever done.  But he said as far as getting all the roles, uh, it just hurt him.  Wow.  Cause I think, uh, moviegoers in general want to look at him as a super hero.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It was very interesting when he said that.  I'll bet he didn't get right after that, any good scripts that would have followed up  in that vein.  Like that was probably the problem.  And then he probably, if he got a couple of crappy scripts, then maybe it hurt him because 
[00:15:00]  they didn't do all the box office cause they, no one said they were good.  I don't know, but I mean, he was so good in that, man.  Yeah.  Really?  Hey, uh, this is going to be funny for a few people.  I guess for the rest of America, Bob Grant is a radio legend.  We talked to him yesterday cause he got, he got it.  He got effed by, uh, this trade magazine called radio and records.  And, uh, so we, we had a little interview with the guy.  He's, he's definitely been an influence in all of our careers and we have no problem admitting  that.  And, uh, here's Bob Grant asking Anthony, who was not here yesterday to do his, uh, very 
[00:15:30]  famous Bob Grant impression.  This is how it went down yesterday.  Uh, now before I do, uh, leave, I want to hear Anthony do his famous imitation.  All right.  Uh, Anthony with the famous Bob Grant.  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  Um, get off my phone.  Forging ahead.  Hey, you know, that's so good. 
[00:16:00]  That you could go around using that voice saying things and I'd get blamed.  Oh God, that was terrible.  Hey, forging ahead.  It sounded like Jim saying forging ahead.  Yes.  To, to take you inside that clip when he goes, I want to hear that.  Oh, that's funny.  You hear me say something like, uh, all right, here we go.  I was ready to do it.  I'm like, oh God.  And then I saw Jimmy, like, I think I can do it.  I'm like, all right. 
[00:16:30]  We had this whole thing going on in that two or three second period and Jimmy went with  it.  We did a whole interview with him and he had no idea that Anthony wasn't here.  Yes.  Bob Grant is Jewish.  That was another thrill yesterday.  I was talking to him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just a funny, legendary, uh, radio personality.  Yes.  And curmudgeon.  All right.  So Ant's feeling better.  Yeah.  Uh, there's a huge staff meeting here in New York city for this radio station. 
[00:17:00]  Are we going to find out what this is about?  Uh, before nine.  When our cards don't swipe tomorrow morning.  Well, tomorrow's Saturday.  Ah, well.  Oh yeah.  We do come in here to do a, you know.  Oh yeah.  We prep.  We do shows for each other on the weekend.  Just sit here.  Keep in practice.  Well, Tom usually says hi after the first break.  So we'll all just stare at the door when we go to commercial.  Yeah.  And see if he actually comes in.  If he comes in.  If he does something.  If he doesn't come in, that says a lot. 
[00:17:30]  That'll be bad.  So I wouldn't go anywhere today.  Perhaps a phone call to his office might be, uh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, uh.  All right.  We'll get to the bottom of that.  We got lots to do today, by the way.  Bin Laden's son wants peace.  Uh.  Yeah.  And then you read what he's saying.  And, uh.  Yeah.  Well.  This is just a quick headlines.  Ty.  Uh.  The tiger attack.  Yeah.  One of the victims admitting that, uh.  They may have taunted the tiger.  But the story is unbelievable.  The tiger ruled.  Absolutely.  Oof.  And, uh.  And we'll get into the patch a little bit. 
[00:18:00]  And, uh.  What Randy Moss did to that girl.  Allegedly.  I don't know what the hell the story is.  They're not getting into details.  But, ow.  I'm hearing they're calling in a scaffolding company to rebuild the girl.  We'll give you the details in just a bit.  And other thangs.  Thangs.  Other thangs for the show.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we said that.  Yeah.  The cast of Cloverfield.  The main people from Cloverfield.  We'll be in here today as well.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, good morning.  Opie and Anthony.  Morning.  With ya.  TGIF.  Well, here's the Tom update.  He didn't come in to say hi.  No.  We didn't hear from Tom.  He didn't come in.  He always comes in during that first break to say, hi, boys. 
[00:19:00]  How you doing?  Hi, Jim.  We make fun of his tie.  Hands over.  Tee to the sick people.  Right.  I hope right now he's pulled over and changing a tire and having water splashed all over his $2,500 coat.  Just muttering things under his breath and didn't hear me say that.  Well, there's something going on.  I just hope we're not the brunt of the joke in the end.  Because for some reason, we weren't told about a big staff meeting that's happening at 9 o'clock here in New York City for this radio station we broadcast from. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Would we show up to it, though?  Of course not.  We would never go.  Mandatory meeting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's mandatory.  Mandatory.  We'd say we can't.  We're busy.  We were invited to the last mandatory meeting.  Let's just put it that way.  It's not that I don't want to hear about the sales.  Because, I mean, a lot of times Tom will come in and talk about the future and it really...  Well, maybe our invite got lost in the mail. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, it could happen.  So we'll keep you updated.  We'll let you know if Tom comes in today.  Comes into our studio today.  I'm sure he's here.  Down the hall.  Hiding.  Behind his desk.  He doesn't want to come in here and, like, tell us what's going on?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  He's in the fetal position behind his desk.  Oh, no.  I hate days like this. 
[00:20:30]  Maybe compromising photos of Tom have surfaced on the net.  Oh.  And we're not supposed to talk about him?  Yeah.  Well...  Sexy.  Younger, wilder days in, like, the 70s.  Let the search begin, because we just might need those pictures at this point.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  A bunch of people thought that you might have had the ebonic plague.  The ebonic plague.  Yeah.  I had a little...  A little...  A faux pas?  A little faux pas yesterday.  I had a great rant, and then I effed it up by saying ebonic plague. 
[00:21:00]  The ebonic plague.  That's classic.  Which kind of made sense, because I was also talking about Obama.  So, it sort of worked out in my favor.  Oh, okay.  You've got to watch what you're saying.  No, the reason...  I'll say it again.  The reason I want Barack Obama to be the next president of the United States is because  I want stuff to happen during my lifetime.  That's it.  Because nothing changes.  And if you think a black president's going to change things, you're insane. 
[00:21:30]  You're completely insane.  Not technically, but socially.  I just want to see what that would mean.  I just want to see.  Oh, you do, huh?  I want to see the protests.  I want to see everything that comes with having a black president.  Yes.  I want stuff to happen in my lifetime.  We've had a lot of cool stuff happen in our lifetime.  Hell yeah.  A lot of interesting stuff.  But I want more stuff.  More stuff.  And then I said I want another ebonic plague. 
[00:22:00]  Ebonic.  Which messed up my whole rant.  Ebonic.  Which was going very well yesterday.  I know, and I'd actually rather have bubonic than ebonic.  Yes.  Way to trip over that one.  I have stuffed banana in my mouth.  Yes, you do.  Thank you for that, by the way.  Well, we're heading toward the big football games over the weekend.  Yeah.  A lot of excitement.  And we got your football news here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  My favorite one.  We got a couple things going on.  Of course, we got the guy tattooing the Patriots helmet on his head. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, what the hell is that about?  How do you do that?  I don't know.  We got the story.  Why?  There's a picture in today's paper where there's a Packers fan pointing disgustingly toward the head of a Giants fan.  And the Giants fan's got the logo carved in his hair, basically.  That goes away.  That's easy.  Yeah.  To actually tattoo the whole helmet on your head.  Dope.  And then, of course, I think we got an update on the man that taped the Packers jersey to his son. 
[00:23:00]  Yep.  You know what that's about, right?  Oh, yeah.  His son's not a Packers fan, and his son is not a sports fan.  Daddy's trying to turn somebody around, if you know what I mean.  He could be a Packers fan.  Well, maybe he is a Packers fan, right?  Right.  Well, my favorite football news story today is Randy Moss.  Yeah.  There is something going on with Randy Moss.  Something happened.  And this girl, here's the story. 
[00:23:30]  In New England, a lawyer for Randy Moss says the Florida woman who claims he beat her up may have gotten hurt during sex.  Joseph Friedberg says she only received a minor injury while the two were fooling around.  He says the two had an intimate relationship.  Friedberg says her lawyer called Moss' agent and demanded $500,000 for the injury, or she would go public.  Hmm.  What's the injury?  Oh, nice.  That's the story, huh?  Ow. 
[00:24:00]  She got hurt during sex.  Ow.  What's that?  Well, let's just say maybe it was similar to...  You ever do a load of laundry, and you have your white socks, and you put it in with a red shirt,  and the only thing that comes out of the washer is a red shirt and a bunch of pink socks?  It's so annoying when that happens.  It's so annoying when you put it in with a shirt, and you put it in with a shirt, and oh, it's just a mess when you're done. 
[00:24:30]  Well, and it's your pink sock.  Like, it's almost like if it's your sock.  If you're pulling someone else's sock out of the dryer, it doesn't matter.  Right.  Who cares?  It's theirs.  It's theirs.  You just don't want your socks to be pink.  No.  What is the injury?  Do we know?  It looks silly.  I don't know. 
[00:25:00]  What?  You don't know the injury?  You know, I didn't know where you were going with that.  Oh, God.  Jimmy.  I swear to God.  I have another cup of coffee.  I was like, oh.  T-shirt.  I curse that pink sock.  I curse it, I do.  By the way, Ken and PA going back to Barack Obama.  And this has been coming up every time I say I want Obama to be the president of the United States.  Besides my dumb theory, I don't give a crap who the president of the United States is.  I'm one of those guys.  I'm from that school because I just feel like nothing really ever changes significantly no matter who's in there. 
[00:25:30]  And it's just a bunch of nonsense.  It really is.  But he writes, Barack Obama doesn't stand for free speech.  Did you forget about Imus already?  Now, Barack Obama was against Imus and the happy, oh, you can't say that, right?  Yeah, but we, it's, yes.  You can't say that, right?  No.  You can't say that, Jimmy?  No.  So I got to back up a little bit, I guess.  So, yeah, Barack Obama doesn't stand for free speech.  Did you forget about Imus already?  Now, he was against Imus and what Imus said. 
[00:26:00]  But here's the thing.  All the candidates were against what Imus said.  He said, every single one of them.  McCain and Giuliani, the two Republicans, both said, well, he apologized, let's move on.  Yeah.  Right, they were a little better about the whole thing.  And a man in my position.  He looks just like him.  Yeah.  Sorry, distracted.  Jack Waltz.  Oh, yeah.  But that's the guys who were the most forgiving about the verbal screw-up.  We're both conservatives who are typically considered the worst with free speech. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Not in this day and age.  All right, if Obama is elected, I want a trade-off, though.  Can we go back to movies and TVs having white presidents?  Can we just do that if he's elected?  Yeah, I guess we could.  We could get that done, right?  Every movie and TV show now, it's like, hey, here's the president.  Oh, geez.  Yeah.  When did that happen?  Oh, no.  Bobby Fisher died.  God damn it.  Bobby Fisher's dead.  Checkmate. 
[00:27:00]  Breaking news.  Checkmate for Bobby Fisher.  Well, was he sick, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I think the government got to him.  Oh, man.  Wasn't he saying some crazy stuff?  Well, he was.  Jimmy, wasn't he saying crazy stuff about the government?  Jimmy's heroes.  Yeah, man.  He hated.  He was crazy.  Bobby was nuts.  He was in, I believe, Reykjavik, Iceland, because the U.S. wanted him.  Yeah, he went over to, like, Russia without...  He wouldn't get, like, dental fillings.  He never wanted something in his head that was metal or whatever.  He was a genius. 
[00:27:30]  Maybe he was right.  Epic proportions.  That was great.  What did he die of?  Don't know, man.  No one knows.  I just saw The Flash.  I just saw The Flash.  Yeah, chess game with the Grim Reaper.  I guess God needed a chess player.  God was lonely just sitting next to that chess board, and he needed someone to play with.  Yeah.  64.  He wasn't that old, man.  Right.  Wait till you see that cartoon.  It'll be Jesus or some kind of angel playing chess with Bobby Fischer.  Checkmate.  And there'll be clouds all around in the cartoon. 
[00:28:00]  They always do that.  And there'll be Jews standing there booing him.  What a self-hating Jew Bobby was.  Look him up on YouTube, the way he talked about the Jews.  He was a nut.  Really?  Yeah.  Let's find out about Randy Moss.  So, from the Boston Herald, I believe.  The Florida woman charging Patriots star, Randy Moss, with battery, says he offered hush  money to cover up degrading conduct that caused her serious injury.  Oh, degrading conduct.  Serious injury.  But his lawyer says it was consensual horseplay that resulted in... 
[00:28:30]  Horseplay?  Uh-oh.  Is it like that video from Oregon?  Seattle, you goose.  Seattle?  Yes.  And there's a place in Oregon, too, I think.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I got to get a sound clip ready.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Is this going to get a laugh?  Not the sound clip, what I'm about to read.  Oh.  Uh, where were we?  Okay.  Randy Moss, with battery, says he offered, uh, all right, conduct that caused her serious 
[00:29:00]  injury.  But his lawyer says it was consensual horseplay that resulted in an injury to her finger.  Oh, no.  What?  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeepers.  Oh, boy.  Sounds like Randy decided that, ah, it wasn't a good idea.  After all. 
[00:29:30]  He might have moved quickly.  Well said.  All right.  Thank you.  Did you read this part about according to Freeberg?  Yeah, you read whatever you want, Jimmy.  This story is, uh, terrific.  This is wonderful.  According to Freeberg, Moss helped Washington put ice on her finger before leaving her condo  an hour later on the wonderful ice on the old finger.  What else?  And Purell on it.  What could possibly happen?  How do you injure a finger during sex besides the one we're all thinking of? 
[00:30:00]  The obvious.  Somebody grabbed her hand.  Maybe, like, maybe, uh, okay.  Oh, wow.  Anything else in this article, Jimmy, from the Herald?  I'm, uh, she suffered physical and mental harm.  See, if there was a degrading conduct, I don't know if that just is hurting your finger  during regular sex.  Well, that was the only part that got hurt, like.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of people saying that, uh, this woman is possibly a gold digger.  Oh, really? 
[00:30:30]  If you know what I mean.  So.  Oh, my God.  That is, uh.  What you gotta get through before you get to gold.  A lot of dirt.  Oh, no.  Okay.  That's pretty much it.  That's pretty much the bullet points on that.  That's hilarious.  So, we'll have to wait and see what happens with that. 
[00:31:00]  And then, of course, uh.  She'll be in, she'll be in court, uh, and they'll say, do you have any evidence?  And she'll just walk over to the jury and hold her finger under everybody's nose.  And then, and more, uh.  Juror Sanchez, how do you vote?  And he'll have to, like, get his checkbook out as she walks down the line and she sees  all, like, the juror's heads recoiling, like, oh. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He'll have to do forensic work under the nail.  All right.  What the hell did he do to the finger?  Half a million dollars for an injured finger?  I think it has to do with the degradation more so than the, uh, injured finger.  Well, she wants a half million dollars and her ring back.  Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.  Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub. 
[00:32:00]  I think that did it an hour later.  No, it didn't.  Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.  For the rest of her life, she'll be eating sandwiches lefty, ladies and gentlemen of the  jury.  Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.  Who knows?  We'll find out more, I'm sure, as the days go on here.  In other football news.  She left crying, she left crying, looking like she just went to work on an oil rig. 
[00:32:30]  Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.  All right.  While most displays of fan loyalty have been humorous, 36-year-old dad Matthew Kowald crossed the line.  When his 7-year-old son refused to wear the Packers jersey for last Saturday's game, he held the boy down for an hour and eventually taped the jersey onto him.  Kowald was fined and cited for disorderly conduct.  By the way, that man's wife ordered a restraining order against him since then.  Looks like the boy likes the other team. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  He's not playing.  He's not rooting for the same team as his dad.  You know what that's about, like we said.  Yeah.  Maybe he likes some.  There are a lot of dads out there hoping for, you know.  Yeah.  But they get a, you know, and that doesn't sit well with that.  It's, yeah, he'd rather have his kid wear the jersey than perhaps someday come home with a broken finger and a lawsuit.  Who knows? 
[00:33:30]  You may have cuffed her, Randy.  You watch me have cuffed her.  Like a lot of times when you're, if you're degrading someone, if you're dominating them and you hold their hands behind their back, you could have screwed her finger.  You know what I mean?  Who knows?  Oh, yeah.  It could be something like that.  It's obviously not worth it.  It doesn't necessarily have to be.  Yeah.  Well, we're joking about it.  Yeah.  It's got to be.  It's just a lot more fun that way.  Yeah.  That's boring, Jimmy.  No, not really.  No, I mean, you can't make as many jokes.  Oh, absolutely.  It'd be better if her wrist was the problem.  And then you'd know that Randy was experienced.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  By the way, hotel rooms in Green Bay for this weekend's game.  Yeah.  Like crappy hotels that you could get for less than $100 a night are going for $549 a night.  That's nice.  God, it creeps people out.  I hate when that happens.  Price gouging.  Yeah, where the businesses take advantage.  And they only have like 4,500 hotels in Green Bay.  They're all taken and they're all just like triple the normal price in general. 
[00:34:30]  How can they justify doing that?  Like just raising their rates to whatever they want.  I guess they can.  Supply and demand, my friend.  Oh, yeah.  The backbone of capitalism.  Just to rape people like that.  They want to go on to a football game.  Yeah, there is supply and demand and then there's just extreme extorting money from people.  Ridiculous.  All right.  Let's say hi to Shane in Philly.  Shane, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was wondering if maybe her shirt got called on the doorknob as she was walking out with 
[00:35:00]  her finger in the head.  Blim, blim.  Blim, blim.  Blim, blim.  Blim, blim.  Blim, blim.  Blim, blim.  Blim, blim.  Blim, blim.  Blim, blim, blim.  Blim, blim, blim.  Good morning to all the linger-longerers.  Randy went to her house with a head injury.  Yeah.  And she said she was checking her spinal damage.  Hey, that's a linger-longer right there.  Yes, of course.  A shorter linger-longer, but it was.  And one more football news story.  Meet Victor Thompson.  Yeah, he's such a fan of the NFL team.  He's got their logo tattooed on his head. 
[00:35:30]  Yes, I meant 4,500 rooms.  Give me a break.  It's early, Kevin.  Come on.  Kevin in Connecticut.  Oh, yeah, 4,500 hotels.  Everyone knew what I meant.  Meet Victor Thompson.  Yep, he's such a fan of the NFL team.  He's got their logo tattooed on his head.  What?  Yep, not kidding.  Thompson says he plans to get every bit of the helmet down to the smallest details.  And if the Patriots win the Super Bowl, God help us.  Thompson says he's going to add the Lombardi Trophy to his tattoo along with the years the team won it. 
[00:36:00]  Victor.  Oh, yeah.  You got a lot of guts, man.  What a fool.  I tell you what.  That looks painful.  Yeah, it does look painful.  You got a lot of guts, man.  Well, did you hear my favorite was the squawk after they announced the tattoo?  Yeah.  What?  Looks like Bob Kelly's head in this photo.  Certainly does.  Big, fat.  Big, fat lunk head.  And the guy doesn't have a lot of guts.  He's got an ugly mug. 
[00:36:30]  Meh.  An ugly skull.  So he's doing something with it.  And he wants attention.  Yeah, he's probably fine with himself.  And then that's that.  Pretty good tat.  Damn good tat.  Good logo.  Yeah.  At least it's not a cheesy, like, prison-looking tat or something.  Yeah, but to get the whole helmet on your head, he'll be like the NFL helmet head guy  for a while.  And then he'll just have to realize, who's going to ever sleep with me again?  Is he going to put the face mask on, too?  I hope so.  But he could be putting it on in such a way where the hair will just, you know, cover 
[00:37:00]  up the whole thing.  Yeah, but then he goes bald and he just has, like, a star in the middle of his head.  It looks ridiculous.  How funny would it be if, like, the Patriots, like, joined some, like, gay football league?  And you're stuck with the helmet on your head.  All right.  A little far-fetched.  Yeah.  What can I tell you?  Okay.  Moving on to other things.  Still distracted because Tom, is Tom in the building? 
[00:37:30]  You don't have to look.  I think because we're all scared to actually go down the hall and look.  But he's usually in here by now saying hi to everybody.  We know there's a mandatory staff meeting for everybody that works at this radio station  at 9 o'clock.  We weren't invited.  No.  Which scares me a little bit.  And Tim, Tim admitted to us that that usually means something big is going on.  Something's going down.  So let the speculating begin.  Yep.  Excuse my interruption.  That tough son of a bitch is getting his head tattooed. 
[00:38:00]  They're showing it, like, on video.  Ow.  He is getting his...  The guy's drilling a tattoo needle into...  Like, the guy's laying on his side, getting the side of his skull tattooed, and he's not  crying or screaming.  That's gotta just...  Not only the pain of the needle, but people kind of like that when they get tattoos.  But the vibration in your skull would have to give you a headache.  And they wipe.  I don't know how people get tattoos, because they wipe.  I would always be afraid of it smearing, even though it's going way into your skin. 
[00:38:30]  No, it's going in there.  Yeah.  That's just the extra.  That's something else.  In your head.  That whole time.  I would hate that.  Ugh.  No tats there, Jimmy?  No, never.  You don't have any?  My dad doesn't have any, no.  He's got a Marine Corps bulldog on his arm, and that's it.  Well, that's a tat.  No, no.  I'm saying only one, though.  The Nortons are not a tattooed clan.  Ooh, I see Tom.  Oh, there he is.  Okay.  You want us to take a break?  What is that?  The sign of the cross?  What are you doing?  Oh, geez.  He's making the sign of the cross. 
[00:39:00]  Is that the sign of the cross?  Is everything good?  Oh, no.  Tom's just kind of...  Oh.  He's giving a thumbs up?  Thumbs up.  No?  For some reason.  Tom, you got everybody wondering, why weren't we invited to the big meeting today?  We weren't invited.  Huh?  You're invited.  All right, good.  Invited.  We're invited.  Is there going to be snacks and treats and things?  Absolutely.  Is it a catered meeting?  Huh?  I have lollipops in my office.  Is it a good meeting?  A bad meeting?  It's a good meeting. 
[00:39:30]  Oh.  For who?  Everyone will decide when it's over.  I love the way Tom talks.  God, Tom, you should have gotten into politics.  You really should have.  And he's saying this off mic, by the way.  He doesn't want to be too close to the mic.  He's unflappable.  Yeah.  Here we go.  He's just...  I think that was a sign right there.  That you didn't want to be on mic today.  No, no, no.  No.  Because you're very concerned about the broadcast, usually.  Today, you're like, ah, I'll just talk from the corner of the room. 
[00:40:00]  Good for the station?  It's...  I mean, it's a good...  Everyone will decide.  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, it's not going to upset anybody's, you know, lives, and everyone will go on.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Everyone will go on.  Everyone will go on.  All right.  That's...  Are you retiring?  I have no comment on anything.  I've done...  Wow.  No, I'm not going to tell you Ed.  That has anything to do with anything to do with the meeting.  Okay.  That has nothing to do, you know...  I'm not...  I won't respond to anything about the meeting.  Okay.  All right?  He's Oliver North. 
[00:40:30]  He's really good.  Tom would make such a good politician.  God.  Is this show safe for now?  I'm not going to answer questions.  Oh, no!  He's not answering any questions.  Are we going to have to wear, like, cowboy hats when we broadcast?  That would be another one to answer questions.  Lingy-lingy!  Like, what are those sombreros?  My bran muffins are getting cold.  Can I go eat it?  Oh.  I'm not going to answer any questions. 
[00:41:00]  Can you just say this?  Can you just say this?  What's the meeting about?  Good morning.  Good morning.  All right.  Can you answer this?  Is that the last good morning we're going to have?  Good morning.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That one was that one.  Oh, no.  All right.  Go finish your muffin.  Do you have a warm bran muffin?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Ew.  Where do you get it warm?  I heat it in the microwave.  Oh.  Oh, that's really...  Oh, now it's going to get hard, though, if you let it cool.  You can always reheat it.  Oh, yeah.  That ended up really good. 
[00:41:30]  Bran muffin.  Yes.  Why the taps?  What does that get the most?  What?  You told us to add more sounds to our show, so we figured we'd add more sounds to the show.  It could be relative.  We don't know.  We don't know.  You're not saying anything, so...  I ain't saying a word.  Hey, do you ever take psyllium husk?  Psyllium husk?  It's like Metamucil.  Tom's talking about Metamucil.  Right.  It's supposed to be good.  Out of your mind?  What is that?  Because he has bran muffin and Metamucil, I'm just thinking...  It's amazing when you make it into work. 
[00:42:00]  No problem.  All right.  All right?  Yep.  All right.  We can't be there, though.  You know that.  Should I say adios?  I said at nine so that you could be there.  Oh, okay.  See, he never wants to acknowledge that we actually continue broadcasting after...  No.  It doesn't matter.  20 minutes.  We do a show, and then we go play somewhere.  It'll be...  You know, it'll start promptly at nine and end promptly at, like, 9-0-1.  Really?  Oh.  Is it a quickie?  Yeah, it should be a quickie.  Mm-hmm.  Are you all right?  I am more than fine.  Okay.  I'm sorry. 
[00:42:30]  I'm just trying to get over my cold.  That's all.  Yeah.  All right.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Go eat your warm bran muffin.  The big announcement is I'm going on vacation.  Ooh.  Where are you going?  Florida.  Nice.  Okay.  For how long?  Looking at...  A week.  No.  Retirement homes?  No way.  You're not going to retire.  You couldn't retire to Florida.  No.  Yeah, I'm with you.  You can't.  No way.  Razzle Rizzo.  What's to do after the rest of your life?  I'm walking here.  Yeah.  All right.  Impression.  The best is when he's on the bus. 
[00:43:00]  Hey, I wet myself.  All right, boys.  All right, Tom.  Thank you, Tom.  So we're officially invited to the meeting.  Does anybody remember laughing?  Yeah, exactly.  I hope that bran muffin right now is just like a brick.  It's sitting there like a paperweight.  I'm trying to cut it.  I'm like...  Oh, no.  That was nice splashing water on me as I'm changing a flat tire.  Yeah, but that was really nice.  I didn't mean it.  I said nothing but nice things about you.  I didn't mean it. 
[00:43:30]  That was Anthony doing his Jim Norton impression.  Yeah, exactly.  No.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of Tom.  No, is it?  Oh.  What happened?  I don't know.  There was supposed to be something else.  Ah.  Let my people go.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:44:00]  Hello.  I want to say hi to Steve in Indiana.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, I was just calling to talk about your 9 o'clock meeting.  Yeah.  I wanted to be the first one to tell you your mom's box.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I want to hear that.  I hope that's not true.  That's not.  Please.  Thank you, Steve.  Jimmy, what do you got?  You were ranting during the break there.  Yeah.  Two things.  What was really annoying me is fat chance NYPD. 
[00:44:30]  No fitness rules for cops.  Yeah.  This Americans with Disabilities Act, they frown on discrimination against obesity.  All right, fine.  But when it comes to being a cop, they test you, I think you're in the academy, but they  can't test veteran officers.  Like, how could, I don't know.  Well, you kind of need some sort of physical fitness to be an effective cop.  Yeah.  So why wouldn't they test?  Are they afraid of being seen as discriminatory? 
[00:45:00]  How can they not have height and weight requirements for the police department?  Yeah, and you're not saying that these guys need to be ripped, but, you know, in some kind  of shape.  I guess there's a story here in New York, what, a cop that was 500 pounds or something  like that?  Yeah.  500 pounds.  500 pounds.  And who's going to ride the car with that fat ass?  Ugh.  Stopping every five minutes at a fast food joint.  Got to smell his lamb chop underarms.  Big disaster crack.  He probably drove a paddy wagon and just, his whole fat body was in the back of it. 
[00:45:30]  All cranky.  Well, how is he going to help a partner?  If your partner's getting his ass kicked, trying to, I almost said, make a collar and  then realize it's not 1971.  Oh, jeez.  I'm not Serpico.  But, uh, how are you going to help him?  Yeah, you can't.  And you can't, uh, run.  No.  You guys are not running anywhere to pursue anybody.  You can't be an effective cop.  No.  No way.  What if there's a woman being raped in a stairwell?  I mean, literally, how are you going to run up the steps?  Yeah.  You can't.  And what's that about? 
[00:46:00]  Why don't they have, uh...  It's very simple.  It's the ADA, the American with Disabilities Act.  Yeah.  Is that people are so afraid of being seen as discriminatory, and of course, obesity is  a disability.  It's not because of the way you behave.  Um, it's never your fault.  It's just a disability.  You're eating healthy and exercising and happen to be getting fat, you know, unlike everything  else we're talking about exercising.  It's not your fault.  Just watch a fat show on TV and you realize that, uh, being fat is not healthy on any level.  But to not have standards for a cop...  I don't...  If you're an office worker, that's one thing. 
[00:46:30]  Mm-hmm.  But for a cop to not have physical fitness standards is just...  It's laughable.  And it's like, you know, you create something like the American with Disabilities Act to  prevent discrimination, and it just gets used incorrectly.  Yeah, there's no reason that they have to keep the guy employed.  You reach a certain weight, you're out.  You're out.  Or they give you time to lose it, or something, you know?  You can't just say that you're gonna keep being a cop and be a big fat piece of crap. 
[00:47:00]  I've walked around the city and seen it.  You ever do that occasionally?  You just walk around, you see a cop and go like, oh my god, how...  They shouldn't have to make uniforms that big.  Thank you.  Bravo.  I want to plug this benefit.  No, you can't, Jimmy.  But it's not for me.  Yeah, but you can't do it.  For Mr. Kite?  No, actually, it's a very good...  It's a good one.  Yeah, it's for...  Tickets are going on sale.  It's called the Jerry Red Wilson Foundation Comedy Benefit. 
[00:47:30]  He was a comedian.  He was a friend of a lot of ours.  He died in 1998 of a spinal meningitis, and they do a benefit every year for him.  So we're doing it Wednesday, March 5th at Town Hall here in New York City.  This will sell out very quickly.  Tickets go on sale this morning, 10 a.m. at Ticketmaster.  It's myself, Dave Attell, Pete Correale, Nick DiPaolo, Greg Fitzsimmons, Artie Lang, and Kevin Meany.  Wow.  So that show...  I went to one of those like two or three years ago.  It's a great show. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, there's great comics.  Yeah.  And I'm not saying that because I'm on it, but you know, it's...  And it's a great cause.  Absolutely.  So March 5th here in New York City.  The comedians help in their own.  That's a little strange.  I know.  Well, comics are pretty...  It's a little strange that you guys are actually helping somebody.  I am helping.  You'd be surprised how good comics are.  Oh, they only come out when there's tragedy.  Yeah.  Comics always show up.  And the rest of the time, they're wishing that same tragedy on each other.  And making fun of it when it happens to anybody.  That's the beauty of it.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's like the actors always come out when they're trying to do benefits, and they just  bore everybody with, you know, speeches. 
[00:48:30]  Because actors are very gifted, but they can't go in front of a live audience and be entertaining.  It's like De Niro.  Every time he talks, God love him.  He's a brilliant actor, but he's always awkwardly holding a paper and looking over those glasses.  He's always got glasses, and he's looking down, and he's, like, peeking up at the audience  as he's, you know, petrified, because there's no camera.  There's actually real humans staring at him.  Making that mouth.  Yeah.  And I want to thank the, uh, it's always awkward seeing De Niro be a person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, just, just.  I want to see him be a character in a movie. 
[00:49:00]  I want to see him black and white just hitting Vicky.  That's all I want to see.  A great movie.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  How's Brooklyn today?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen.  Me and my partner were cops over here in Queens, and we were just laughing about the weight  requirement.  Because I graduated with a guy that was as fat as could be, and he went into, like, a housing  project, like, assigned to that, and, dude, I can't, I can't imagine that guy doing, like,  you know.  We've been recording for, like, a fat ass ass.  We're laughing with each other.  I'm sure you're glad. 
[00:49:30]  But, uh, but the whole point is that he's got to go up the stairs, like, at least four  or five times a day.  And not for nothing, when I'm getting my, you know, exactly, when I get something handed  to me, especially if someone's kicking me around, I need someone to be there.  You know what I mean?  And the whole point is that we were talking about this.  There should be some sort of requirement, at least once a year, like a qualifying round.  Years ago, there used to be, uh, there used to be, uh, requirements for girls and everything  like that to, uh...  Didn't they lower the standards so they could get more women on the police force, too?  Dude, I have no idea. 
[00:50:00]  It's politics.  Probably.  And, you know, I say this all the time.  You guys are being liberal.  It's just...  Thank you.  I love these guys.  But the whole point is that it's just that when we're getting something handed to us,  and, you know, if I can say ass on the air, I hope I can.  Yeah.  Dude, I need someone to be there.  And, you know, me and my partner, we're not, like, my partner's going to say he's the...  He was just a guy around.  But, uh, to be honest with you, you know, we can trust in each other.  We can rely on each other.  You know that if I need to run to get to him, I can get to him in time, and I'll be behind him.  Yeah, I got it.  And then, you know, and we laugh all the time. 
[00:50:30]  Because in the academy, it's like whenever we did the runs and everything, we laugh.  Because it's like if we're running after somebody, you have to cut back a little bit.  So, you know what I mean?  All right.  Hey, Joe, what's the best call you've gotten on this shift?  The best call tonight?  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Since you've been on the shift.  What's the best call we got tonight?  I think the funny thing was going to a call, and it ended up being that the guy who was 
[00:51:00]  like a call for help, it ended up being the guy who just wanted, like, cigarettes and soda.  God, you just want to take the stick to him.  Yeah.  All right, Joe.  What's not going to happen?  You're distracting everybody.  You know, when you call our show, and it was a good call, you've got to turn down the radio.  There's enough delay where you'll be able to hear a bunch of it by the end of it.  Thanks, bro.  Yeah, all right.  It's distracting because you can hear the show in the background there.  Let's say hi to John in Staten Island.  There's Staten Island. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know anything about it.  It's a weird place.  What's up, bud?  I'll say it every time.  Staten Island creeps me out.  They're testing animals and stuff over there.  I'm positive.  Are you saying there's some kind of weird?  Oh, yeah.  Science experiments.  Have you ever been to Staten Island?  Yeah.  Just drove through.  Most New Yorkers just drive through Staten Island.  You drive through to get to Jersey.  I've been living in the New York area most of my life, off and on.  You know, I do a radio job here, a radio job there.  But in general, you know, this is like home base. 
[00:52:00]  I've never done anything in Staten Island.  It's like an extension to me of the Verrazano Bridge.  It's just a bridge made of dirt.  Right.  That's what Staten Island is to me.  To get over to Jersey, you take the Verrazano, and then you go on the dirt bridge for a while.  Yeah.  And then either the outer bridge or the Gothels.  We use you as a shortcut to Jersey.  Yeah.  That's all we know about Staten Island.  A big, wide, dirt bridge.  And we ask you guys, you know, tell me one cool thing about Staten Island. 
[00:52:30]  And we can't.  We can't.  We can't get anything from you guys.  All right, John.  What do you got?  You guys are saying it's not okay for cops to be overweight because, you know, they've got to chase people down.  But Jimmy said, well, it's okay if you're an office worker.  But in reality, it's not.  We all pay into our health care.  I agree.  Dude, I think that guy is costing me more money.  I agree with you.  I'm talking only about job effectiveness.  And I'm talking about what the Americans with Disabilities Act, which I agree with you. 
[00:53:00]  It does cost us all.  And Morgan Spurlock raised a great point when he did his thing about compulsive overeating.  He was like, if you see somebody smoking, it's perfectly acceptable to criticize that because that's addictive and self-destructive and insurance bleeding.  Well, what about this?  Unhealthy.  So, yeah.  But I agree with you, dude.  But I was only talking about effectiveness at work.  I was just talking.  I just figured I'd get my two cents in on fat guys.  Punching out, guys.  Have a good morning.  All right.  It's not even a knockout of fat guys.  It's just that's a job.  Being a cop, that's kind of a job where you should have to be physically fit.  You need to be.  And you should be a certain height. 
[00:53:30]  That's a fireman.  Same thing.  I watch Biggest Loser.  And by the end of the show, they test these people.  They go to a doctor before they start, and they go to a doctor afterwards, and their diabetes goes away.  Diabetes.  High blood pressure goes away.  Their high cholesterol goes away.  Now, obviously, they're at a fat camp, and they're working their butts off.  They're exercising around the clock and eating right.  But it just goes to show you that you can get rid of a lot of these health issues by just staying healthy and eating right. 
[00:54:00]  Slimming down.  Hey, speaking of fat, I don't know if this guy was fat, but it's a great story.  Listen to this.  Police say Thursday night, David Scott Spillers didn't get the two orders of fries he asked for and was so angry,  he not only rammed his car into this McDonald's play area,  he went on to smash into the side of the restaurant where customers normally sit.  It's a lot of damage, but what's worse is that people could have been killed as a result of this guy's poor decision  because of an order that wasn't correct. 
[00:54:30]  Police say Spillers drove off but was trapped down easily.  Well, the officer, after he responded to the scene, kind of tracked the glass that was there at the scene  all the way to an adjacent apartment that was not very far away.  He tracked it right to the car.  He's angry.  He's angry because they got his order wrong.  Hold on, man.  John in Staten Island. 
[00:55:00]  John.  Yellow, John.  Yellow.  John.  Hey, Yone.  Hello.  What's up, John?  Hey, what's going on with this bash in the Staten Island, huh?  It's a place that scares us.  We don't know anything about it.  What's a bad?  It's a dirt landfill, a bunch of garbage.  It used to be clean a long time ago.  And I kind of got to agree with you that it's nothing but a landfill toxic disaster. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, my God.  Well said.  Sounds like the toxins got to you, sir.  Yeah.  You know, people out there born with, you know, with three, you know, what's in their yam bag.  What is he talking?  No one knows.  Oh, my God.  He's talking about, like, I'm thinking something about toxic.  Everyone in Staten Island is going, okay, good.  We're off the hook.  There you go, Staten Island.  Hey, Ant.  This is who's representing you this morning.  Yeah, Ant, sorry to hear you suffered through a little bit of scatterbow last night. 
[00:56:00]  Have the old tempered feeling.  Just fine.  Thank you.  All right, John.  Disgusting, man.  Here's the second half of that McDonald's story.  McDonald's sent First Coast News this statement.  The safety of our customers and employees at our restaurants is very important to us.  Fortunately, no one was injured in this unfortunate, isolated incident.  It goes on to say it would be inappropriate for them to comment on what may have prompted the incident. 
[00:56:30]  People are human.  They ought to make mistakes with orders and what have you.  But, you know, you've got to manage your anger, and clearly he didn't in this case.  When police confronted Spillers, they say he confessed.  At that point, very remorseful as to what he had done and said that he was actually going to go back up to the restaurant to apologize.  Talk about an unhappy meal.  Unhappy meal.  Well, I get it, because they have something called a...  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Just read the news, stupid.  Talk about an unhappy meal.  I can't even comment on this.  I know.  More drivel from the newswriters.  Is that, like, supposed to be funny or, like, clever?  I don't know what it was.  These are the same people that have immunity from, basically, from FCC fines because they're the news.  Yeah.  And they have a different set of standards when broadcasting than the rest of us because they're the news, which means they have integrity. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  They're doing a public service.  Talk about an unhappy meal.  Not even delivered well like a comic.  Right.  Talk about an unhappy meal.  Wow.  What a way to punch it home.  Let's say hi to Dustin in Boston.  What's up, Dustin?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just want to say that with more respect, I got it all for you.  So I just want to talk about the police thing and the weight requirement. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  I took the police test.  I took the PAT test, and I'm 300 pounds.  And I'll tell you, like, I can outrun almost anybody.  I got the most agility.  You're going downhill.  Yeah.  No.  Well, that means you're a young guy, Dustin.  How young are you?  No, no, no.  No, I'm 24.  Are you 8 feet tall?  Yeah, I'm 6'4".  6'4", 300 pounds.  Oh, wow.  Right.  No, I mean, I got muscle.  I got a little weight.  You know, you could see it.  But, you know, like, the weight requirement, it should be, you know, 500 pounds is ridiculous. 
[00:58:30]  You know, I see a lot of people.  I'm from Boston.  I think it should be a height weight thing you got to, like, do the math with.  6'4", 300 isn't as bad as 5'10", 300.  Yeah.  Exactly.  5'9", 300, whatever.  I definitely think that's why they do have the PAT test.  You know, if you can't do that, because, like, it was three minutes.  And, like, I had to run, like, you know, you run around three different circles, and you've got to, like, jump over a six-foot wall. 
[00:59:00]  And, yeah, it's tough, you know.  But, yeah, I mean, if you can't do that, then you should definitely not be a police officer.  So, if you can at least do it, like, every six years or something like that, have them do it again.  All right.  All right, sir.  Thank you, Dustin.  You got it, guys.  Bye.  All right.  There he goes, Dustin.  Let's say hi to Rob in Pittsburgh.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Anthony.  Well, Jimmy.  Hey, I'm an HR manager.  I have a master's in labor relations.  And the problem is, is ADA doesn't cover obesity because it's correctable, like eyesight. 
[00:59:30]  Okay.  So, um.  They're always citing it.  I think it's more of the.  What?  They're always citing it, though.  Like, they say here in this article that the courts frown on, the courts really frown upon discrimination against obesity, this labor lawyer was saying.  So, maybe it doesn't cover it, but maybe it's cited a lot for some reason?  I think it's a real big obesity.  We're talking, like, 600 pounds or something.  But just being overweight isn't, you know, you can correct that at some point. 
[01:00:00]  To get to those standards.  And also, the standards have to be related to the job.  Like, you know, the cops, because they have to go after people and they have to be able to run.  Whereas somebody working in a plan, as long as they can pick up the machinery they're working, you know, you can't require them to have a weight requirement.  Right, but they.  Unless it's a safety issue.  I think they do something now called, like, height to weight or body mass index.  There's some kind of a ratio they use, which is how airlines are able to do it.  Because you notice you have some big flight attendants, but there's nobody that big. 
[01:00:30]  Not like big, they've got to be able to fit down the aisles.  Absolutely.  And an emergency helps you.  Yeah.  Not just get stuck somewhere causing a big pileup.  Yeah.  That's where everything can be correctable is under safety.  If you use safety as a guide, you can do a lot of things.  But it's also the union, you know, because, you know, police unions, any unions, you know, they're going to protect their workers.  And they're going to allow people to stay on the job because they need the numbers to be able to keep.  Whoa.  How about in human resources?  Do you deal with a lot of, like, just trivial? 
[01:01:00]  Because we have this really weird hatred of human resources because they just represent, like, this, where they listen to all the nitpickers and the snivelers and make an issue out of it.  Yeah.  See, I'm the exact opposite.  I'm like the, you know, if it's a legal issue, yeah, you know, we've got to take care of it.  But if not, you know, I try to tell people to suck it up.  You know, I'm a plant HR manager, so there's always crap going on in the plant between, you know, people getting made fun of.  And, you know, people just need to suck it up nowadays. 
[01:01:30]  I mean, if there's a legal protection, you need to take care of it.  But if not, suck it up.  Be a man.  You know, if stuff happens, get over it.  All right, buddy.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right.  Take care.  No problem, guys.  We'll be in Cleveland, Jimmy.  Okay, thanks, man.  Right on.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Before we say hi to Joe, can I just point out one thing how horrifying this plane crash was?  Oh, no kidding.  We'll get to the next.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey, Joe.  Listen, I just wanted to say something about Staten Island.  I think it's the whitest borough in the city. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, but the problem with that is it's those, like, white people that live in the woods, and they, like, have sex with each other.  Oh.  No, I don't think so.  And they're kind of like, there's, like, a lot of inbreeding and stuff.  That's what I read about Staten Island.  Never heard that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They do animal testing.  There's toxins all over the place.  And white people that live in the woods have sex with each other for a long time.  But now they're kind of, like, living among us.  Oh. 
[01:02:30]  They're kind of tainting the population in Staten Island.  Tainting?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What have you heard about Staten Island, Anthony?  Nothing.  I heard that there's a highway that goes right through it.  Right through it.  And that's all I've seen.  Mm-hmm.  I've seen the left lane.  And that's it.  That's it.  All right.  I liked the Wilford Grimley reference before.  Thank you.  Go to Liberty, Liberty Supplies, for your diabetes supplies.  Diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, 
[01:03:00]  diabetes testing supplies.  And with that, we're going to go to break.  Actually, why don't we go to the FU line and see what's going on.  It is FU Friday.  This is Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have seven new voice messages.  First voice message.  I'd like to give a big FU to Diana.  FU, Diana.  Poor. 
[01:03:30]  Next message.  Yeah, I want to send a big FU to this jackass driving because I'm laughing at the Opie and  Anthony show.  They're funny, you ****.  Get a line.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to say a big FU to my ex-girlfriend, Patty.  You made a plan to take off the fall semester from college to travel in Europe.  At the last minute, you go, oh, I can't go back to school.  My daddy won't help me pay for college if I do.  So I went away, and you went back to school, and you start **** my best friend, Tom. 
[01:04:00]  F-U, F-Tom.  Next message.  Hey, this is James in the Hampshire.  I want to send a big FU to my piece of **** boss, who, while he was busy taking at least  eight vacations this year, I was running his company for him.  He had the most profitable year and did more work than history, but I made less money with  less health benefits and less bonuses.  You **** face.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big **** you to my general manager. 
[01:04:30]  Help you choke on a **** bowl full of **** soup.  Next message.  I'd like to give a real special **** you to my boss, who insists on only taking care  of himself.  **** you.  Next message.  I would like to leave a big FU to the **** bowl that almost tried to kill me in Patterson,  New York.  FU.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1. 
[01:05:00]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  If anyone gives a crap, this is my favorite door song right here.  Peace Frog.  Oh, I know why you did this.  Good call.  Was it you?  It was there.  Ah, why would you look over there at E-Rock and say, good call? 
[01:05:30]  Because I still have hope.  You're right.  It would be E-Rock if you said, hey, could you play the end?  Anyway, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm obsessed with this Staten Island.  I don't know anything about it.  I realized that we got a bunch of boroughs here in New York City.  Lived here most of my life when I wasn't doing radio jobs.  And I realized I've never stopped in Staten Island to do anything.  Well, we're doing a little research and learning some things about it. 
[01:06:00]  Do you know that all the frogs, that's why Peace Frog, by the way, are disappearing in Staten Island?  Really?  Go try to find a frog right now in Staten Island.  You're not going to find it.  Why is that?  You're not going to find one frog.  Why is that?  There's something weird that's going on.  That is odd.  There's something not right with Staten Island.  Interesting.  Don't take my word for it.  Go hunting for a frog today.  Good luck.  You're not going to find one. 
[01:06:30]  On Staten Island, check it out.  You're not going to find one.  You're not going to find a frog.  No.  Hey, we got the cast of Cloverfield coming in today.  Give me the Rotten Tomatoes thing there, Iraq.  The only place to go for movie reviews because your local movie reviewer is an ass.  Yeah.  He's a pompous ass.  So you go to RottenTomatoes.com and what they do is they take all the movie reviews.  All the pompous asses.  Yeah, from across America.  Yeah.  Then they give you one solid review.  In this case, Cloverfield is getting 77% positive reviews. 
[01:07:00]  That's great.  That's really good on Rotten Tomatoes.  That means this movie is going to be pretty good for most of the folks out there.  It's a monster movie getting that kind of rating.  You expect this from like, you know, No Country for Old Men, but you don't expect that from  a monster movie.  What did Jeffrey Lyons give it?  Monster movie.  Yeah.  What did Jeffrey Lyons give it?  Because he watched the movie the same time we did.  Yes.  I didn't know that was him.  I always hated his guts.  Why do you hate his guts?  I hate his guts.  Why?  Because he's just so smug.  There's a smugness to Jeffrey Lyons. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  He never liked anything.  He was such a douche.  He's a bespectacled douche.  Well, because a lot of these guys, that's their gig.  They're just nerds.  To not like anything.  They wanted to be in the business on some level.  They weren't good enough to contribute.  And they decided to critique things, which is odd because you're not good enough to do  it.  Yeah.  Then why?  Well, that's always the case.  You're not good enough to do it.  So I'll get a job critiquing other people that do it well. 
[01:08:00]  We're talking about program directors?  Yeah.  Of radio stations?  Consultants.  Sure.  Whoa.  Cloverfield's rating just dropped eight points.  What's that about?  E-Rock, what happened?  It just went from 77% to 69% in front of my eyes.  All the latest reviews are being added to the website, probably.  Maybe a few bad ones came in.  A few bad ones came in.  I expect it.  A movie like that is not going to get...  69% is still very good.  There's a monster in...  Oh, my God.  It went to 40.  20.  Sell. 
[01:08:30]  Sell.  Sell.  Sell.  Quick.  Recession.  Oh, my God.  Now it's back to 77, right?  Yeah.  What are you doing, E-Rock?  What are you doing, E-Rock?  Searching Jeffrey Lyons.  Oh.  Oh.  Where is he?  I haven't found him yet.  Oh, I'm yelling at you.  We're going to go to Stephanie in Staten Island.  Travis, you don't have to talk to her anymore.  Who's answering the phones?  Thank you.  Let's say...  Oh, it's Kathleen.  Okay.  Kathleen, Staten Island.  What's up?  Actually, I'm from Brooklyn, but in Staten Island, there's only two really...  You have the mall, if you're into that. 
[01:09:00]  Right.  And you have a really big Barnes & Noble there.  Wait, so they have a mall and a bookstore?  Pretty much.  It's not better for you, but you have to get the exit.  Oh, and there's restaurants, too.  And there's restaurants.  And you want to shop, and you want to read a book.  There's also albinos.  Right.  I know they have a large albino community there.  Yep.  That's very set apart from the rest of the people in Staten Island. 
[01:09:30]  They live in their own little town.  It's got its own store, and they rarely venture out of that area.  Well, you're going to have to take our word on that one, because they don't come out during  the day.  No.  No, they can't.  The sun.  Right.  The sun does horrible things to them.  They've got those pink eyes and the white skin.  And they just come out at night.  And there's been mysteries about them abducting small children, bringing them back, perhaps  for, who knows, slavery or food, we've even heard. 
[01:10:00]  But that's another thing happening on Staten Island.  Yeah, it's a weird place.  Yeah, it is.  Very strange.  If you find yourself, if you're brave enough to be on Staten Island during the night, pull  your car over, start walking around.  You'll see some of these albinos.  Oh, yeah.  Getting a little fresh air.  Yep.  Side of the road is scary when you come up on one, because they reflect your headlights.  And don't shake anyone's hand.  It looks like a ghost.  Don't shake anyone's hand from Staten Island. 
[01:10:30]  No?  Unless you like shaking, like, webbed hands.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah, they've got those webbed fingers.  Well, almost up to, like, the first knuckle.  It's a weird web thing that a lot of people that were born on Staten Island have.  We're learning a lot about Staten Island.  Hey, Brittany.  Not just a bridge to Jersey.  You want a Brittany update?  Sure.  Can't get enough of this ho-ah.  What is that crazy hose bag doing now?  Well, now they're saying that Brittany has multiple personality disorder. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, she's schizo.  So, well, they were going with the bipolar, but now they're updating it.  Which one's the best F?  The best F?  What do you think?  Which crazy version of a...  Multiple personality.  Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be great.  But which one?  Which one of the personalities?  Like, not the motherly one.  No.  Because occasionally she jumps into this mommy mode where she thinks she's actually a good  mother.  I like the crazy, drunk, smoking, falling out of the car, Brittany. 
[01:11:30]  Because she is completely obtainable.  Yeah.  Completely.  You help her up and she'd be, you know, grabbing at you.  And I gotta tell you, if I was that paparazzi guy that was hanging out with Brittany...  Paparazzi.  Which is just amazing, because she was a huge star and now she's hanging with, you know,  a paparazzi dude.  If I was that guy, I mean, his life sucks.  First of all, he's still married.  He's a paparazzi dude.  That's like just scum.  I would try to get her pregnant.  I said this the other day.  All he has to do is get Brittany Spears pregnant. 
[01:12:00]  He is set for life.  And I bet you that is his goal.  All I have to do is get her pregnant, because she's the type of girl, I don't think she's  going to go for the, you know, the backdoor...  I think she's going to keep the baby.  And then this guy is set for life, because there's plenty of money still to get out of  this girl.  I saw the clip on one of those goddamn entertainment shows, and they were asking her if she had  taken a pregnancy test.  Right.  And she was like, I didn't take no pregnancy test.  Right.  Meh, meh, meh, with that stupid accent of hers. 
[01:12:30]  Well, it was part of her multiple personality disorder.  Sources are now painting a very disturbing picture of Brittany Spears, or whoever she happens  to be at any given moment.  And we're told the whole British accent thing...  Yeah, she's going around talking like she's from Britain.  Well, it's more than an accent.  Brittany has multiple personalities, including, as people in her life call it, the British  girl.  The British girl.  So there are people that are close to her saying one of the personalities they call the British  girl.  We're told when Spears loses the British personality, she has absolutely no idea what she did during 
[01:13:00]  the time she assumed that personality.  Sources say Britt has a number of other identities, where she becomes the weepy girl.  Weepy girl.  The diva.  The incoherent girl.  I like incoherent girl.  You want incoherent girl?  That's the one.  Incoherent girl.  Which one would you like, Jimmy?  Your choices are British girl?  British girl, no.  No.  She thinks she's upper crusty.  Yeah.  Weepy girl?  No.  Then you have to comfort her.  Just crying all the time?  No.  Diva?  No.  Because then, no. 
[01:13:30]  Incoherent girl.  Yeah.  Every guy wants incoherent girl, as far as the Britney personalities go.  Hell yeah.  Time for a poll.  Time for a poll.  The beginning of the end of her was that reality show.  Why?  Don't know.  I mean, it's just...  Yeah, that kind of was the beginning of the whole thing, because before that, everyone  thought she was this virginal, kind of pure, hot girl.  And then she did that reality thing, and you watch it, and just went, oh, she's just... 
[01:14:00]  She's a moron, first of all.  And she's not that image that she had.  I just love it when all the...  Like, was Tom Cruise jumping on the couch, or her doing that reality show?  I just love when these...  De Niro reading.  De Niro reading.  I want to thank...  He's looking down at the paper, but his eyes are over his glasses.  Yeah, those glasses.  I want to thank the foundation here in New York.  Shut up. 
[01:14:30]  Just yell at somebody for not hiding the money well, and they can bring that pink car back.  Knock a wig off his head while you're choking him with a phone cord.  How wonderful is that?  Hey, come on.  But I love it when they just prove what asses they really are.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  All right.  So that's the latest on Britney.  Whatever.  We don't really give a crap if she gets help.  No.  I like the fact, though, that there's actual personalities.  It's not just kind of that she's a little wackier one day than the next. 
[01:15:00]  There's actual people.  Yeah.  This British girl.  Yeah.  Who no one wants.  This is going to end with another pregnancy.  You watch.  That paparazzi is going to be a lucky dude.  He's going to win the lottery.  That's his goal.  I'm convinced of it.  We got another creepy dentist.  We love the creepy dentist on this show.  Yeah, dentists are just ghouls.  It brings up one of my favorite bits on the show, the perv switch.  We all have the perv switch.  Every single one of us, but we control it.  That's the difference.  Whatever happens in your brain, you control the perv switch. 
[01:15:30]  You start thinking crazy stuff.  You look at a girl walking toward you on the street.  You start thinking quickly what you would like to do with that cleavage.  And then you see that the Starbucks is right there, and you go about your day.  But for others, the perv switch goes off, and they can't control themselves, and they  just lose their freaking minds.  Right.  You know, some in very funny ways.  Others in very horrific ways.  But we all have it.  It happens, especially with the dentists, because they get women that are laying in 
[01:16:00]  front of them, anesthetized.  They're pretty much alone in the room with them, and they're looking, and maybe she's  attractive.  And he's just being a dentist, going through, filling teeth.  All right.  Check the x-ray here.  It looks like this, one of her, the lower bicuspid, seems to need a fire.  I gotta feel those cans!  I need them!  Jesus Christ!  Open that shirt!  They just lose their minds in a split second. 
[01:16:30]  But before it gets to that point, Ant, you gotta do the dentist as, you know, tell the  assistant to go down the hall and check the, uh...  Oh, of course!  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be, um...  I got it here, uh, nurse.  I've got it.  You can go down the hall and check on how much x-ray film we have left.  Could you do that?  Because we have a pretty heavy load of, uh, patients today.  So, I...  Okay.  Thank you.  Yes, yes.  I'll be right here with the patient.  All right, let me look at this tooth. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, that's the one that looks a little sensitive.  She was having a little problem with that.  Oh, God.  Oh, I gotta see her!  Oh, my God!  I gotta take those pants!  I gotta see her!  The assistant, uh, uh, comes back in the room.  Oh, yes, no, this was...  And the patient's hair is a little off, and the clothes don't fit quite right.  The shirt's buttoned where you put the wrong button in the wrong buttonhole. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Oh, nurse!  Well, so you're back!  No, there was a little problem with the suction thing, and it drooled out a little bit.  I was hoping everything would be okay.  All right.  She's coming around.  You're fine.  You're fine.  Just lay here in recovery for a while.  Yeah.  Is this supposed to be dentist music?  Dentist's office music?  Oh, wow, you're right.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm doing dentistry in an elevator. 
[01:18:00]  Yes.  And now I'm doing it at...  Or as a Peanuts cartoon.  Wow.  All right.  On the sound effect.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Hey, here we go.  So here's the latest story on a creepy dentist.  Dr. Robert Boyda Jr. is an oral surgeon in Mount Lebanon, but today he did not go to his office.  Instead, he came here to Allegheny County Police Headquarters to surrender to authorities.  Police say he sexually assaulted a number of his patients. 
[01:18:30]  Eight o'clock this morning, Dr. Boyda arrived with his attorney.  Take a look at the criminal complaint.  Sixteen different counts of sexual assault against four different patients, all at his offices in Scott and Robinson Townships.  All were under anesthesia while having their wisdom teeth removed.  Most of the details here are too graphic to repeat, but one patient recalls Boyda exposing himself three to four times.  Another says she woke and the dentist had his hand under the blanket covering her. 
[01:19:00]  The most serious accusation from another patient, she says she recalled being reclined in the dental chair and Dr. Boyda was straddling her.  Oh, my God.  Straddling.  Sorry to the victims, but these are my favorite stories that pop up.  These horny dentists.  Sorry, you guys are just creeps.  You're just ghouls.  Straddling her.  What a great visual.  Yeah. 
[01:19:30]  I think that's a compliment, by the way, to the victim.  How horrified is a dentist, though, when he's straddling her and all of a sudden he sees those eyes flutter open and look at him and he's, you can't not know you're caught.  Do I kill her or put her back under?  You got all those trays and equipment in the way.  That's not easy to just, you know, straddle.  That's another reason.  That's another reason why dentists are always getting caught.  I think they're too scared to kill the people that they've just molested.  It's one of those things. 
[01:20:00]  A dentist can't quite close the deal like that.  Well, it's kind of hard to do in the office, too.  I mean, someone goes in for wisdom teeth and all of a sudden their husband comes to pick him up and you're like, I don't know where she is.  I don't know what happened.  She left.  She got up and left.  She was fine.  I was in the waiting room.  I didn't see her.  Went for a jog.  What about the case we had?  We talked about it on the show down there in Chinatown.  There was a, was it a dentist?  I think it might have been a dentist.  A dentist where the guy, something went horribly wrong in the office with the anesthesia or something. 
[01:20:30]  So he just, he just put her out on the sidewalk.  Oh, right.  And she ended up dying?  Yeah, just dragged her out of the office and threw her on the sidewalk.  They do that occasionally when the, you get these guys that live in an apartment that say they do liposuction.  Right, right.  And corrective surgery and things like that, plastic surgeons.  And they came from Guatemala or something and they're renting an apartment.  People actually go to these people and get horrible infections.  And whenever something bad happens, they find them kind of laying out on the street. 
[01:21:00]  They just take them out.  Ah, sorry.  Oh, well.  Here's the second part of the story.  And, of course, there's a lawyer involved trying to help the dentist out.  What do you think the lawyer's angle is going to be on this there, Jimmy?  That they're lying.  I mean, or that he has some kind of a sexual compulsion problem.  He may have to acknowledge it.  If enough women come forward and he sees it as unwinnable, you have to say it's a sexual compulsion.  Yeah, you're going to say that?  I think his thing is going to be, no, these women are under anesthesia and they're kind of hallucinating. 
[01:21:30]  He's just doing things that dentists do.  Sometimes they do have to get some leverage when they're pulling a tooth and climb on board naked.  Yes.  Or sometimes when applying the, like, you know, when you're going up for cleaning, a lot of times the toothpaste tube will be squeezed and moved back and forth in front of her face.  And then the toothpaste will wind up on her cheek and on her collar and her hair.  Well, let's find out.  Here we go.  Boyd, his attorney, calls these accusations ludicrous. 
[01:22:00]  He says the doctor is never alone with a patient.  He blames us all on anesthesia.  You don't criminally charge somebody based on hallucinations.  And anesthesia is a hallucinogenic.  You base them on very firm facts that don't exist in this case.  But you've got four different people who are saying essentially the same thing, making the same accusations.  Well, you know, these girls are in and out of consciousness and saying they're having these dreams or visions.  The one girl on the most serious charge says that it was a flashback. 
[01:22:30]  And I think that clinically, I don't think you have flashbacks based on anesthesia.  From here, police took Dr. Boyd to a magistrate where he officially entered his plea of not guilty.  After that, he will have a preliminary hearing.  And more than likely after that, he will go to trial.  At Allegheny County Police Headquarters, Ari Haidt Channel 4 Action News.  Action News.  Action News.  Oh, boy.  Some action, all right.  They got action news.  See?  They went with the old hallucinating.  Oh, she's just stories.  Visions.  Dreams.  I don't know. 
[01:23:00]  And then they'll look into her past and they'll find out she, like, stripped one time at a strip club and she can't be trusted.  Yeah.  And then they'll throw the case out.  Did someone dream about that clam chowder on her shirt?  Somebody on Instant Feedback, if you're instant feedbacking from a cell phone, leave your name if you want credit.  This person writes, wait, wait, 16 complaints by four women?  That means they went back four times each?  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  That's always a bad thing, too, for the women.  Never looks good if you go back.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break.  I just got to communique from good old Steve.  Are you executively producing today?  Now that's how you executive produce.  Yeah.  I'm just passing notes today, but that's how you pass a note.  You know, that had me laughing yesterday.  I'm sure it did.  I was just cracking up yesterday just thinking of that.  I think I said it out loud a few times, too, just to get the full impact. 
[01:24:00]  It's contagious.  That's how you executive produce, my friend.  You get the wrong person on the phone.  It's great.  Cock of the walk, are you?  I really was.  I was egocentric and very proud of myself and gloating.  We got the cast of Cloverfield?  Yeah.  They're all here.  Oh, good.  Very cool.  We're going to talk to them next.  I want to try to squeeze in a quickie before we get to the break.  Oh, all right, Jim.  Oh.  This story is just hilarious.  I just want to get it out there. 
[01:24:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, God.  Oh, that was bloody and all I made in my head.  You could eat crap.  I'm going to kill your father.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to kill his ass.  You know what?  I have no idea.  We're going to tell you what that is after the break.  I thought it was a news story.  I didn't know it was the actual clip. 
[01:25:00]  Is there a video?  Oh, there's got it.  There's got it.  It has to be audio from a video.  All right.  What is that?  After the break, we're going to tell you what this is.  Ow.  Ow.  I don't kill him.  Oh, that was bloody and all I made in my head.  You could eat crap.  I'm going to kill your father. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm going to kick his ass.  I'm going to kick his ass.  I don't know what that is.  And there is a video.  So we'll turn everybody on to the video after the break, too.  You have any idea?  None.  None whatsoever?  None.  Jimmy?  I certainly don't.  Are either one of them retarded?  No on that.  All right.  Do you know how many reporters have said that when this show gets in trouble? 
[01:26:00]  Any other guesses?  No?  All right.  Obviously, somebody hit their head.  Yes.  And someone's father is to blame.  Yes.  That's what I'm getting.  I'm trying to, like, just pick it apart a little bit.  But why would...  Is it a...  I don't know.  I can't figure it out.  One more time.  Ah! 
[01:26:30]  Ow!  No.  I don't...  Oh, God.  Ow!  That was bloody and all I made in my head.  You could eat crap.  I'm going to kill your father.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kick him in the ass.  What is that?  Did you get straight?  My favorite part is that I bang my head.  I bang my head.  I don't know what that is.  It reminds... 
[01:27:00]  It reminds me of an old clip we used to play.  Yes.  Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, stop, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I can't breathe.  Stop.  Oh, oh.  All right, we're going to give you the answer after the break,  and we're going to talk to the cast of Cloverfield.  Nice.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Here, check it out, the Opie and Anthony show.  Another busy morning, by the way.  Did you guys hear that sound clip in the green room? 
[01:27:30]  Any of you?  You were too busy yapping and getting your coffee, right?  I was talking negatively about the show.  Yeah.  Actually, I just want to play this clip again,  and then we're going to talk to the guys from Cloverfield.  But if you want to play along, and the girls, obviously,  the beautiful girls, beautiful girls.  Not this morning.  Huh?  Not this morning.  Really?  You guys are really hot.  And I guess we should say ahead of time,  girls are like kryptonite to us.  I mean, when we get pretty girls in the studio, we fall apart. 
[01:28:00]  It's a stupid boys club, so we sit here and just get,  look how hot she is.  Awful.  We're supposed to be like shock jocks and beat the hell out of each other  and stuff, you know, out of guests and things.  And then we get pretty girls, and then we fall apart.  That's very sweet.  As you can tell, as I try to explain that, I'm falling apart.  Stuttering, muttering, slurping, slurping, slurping, slurping.  Anyway, we're trying to figure out what this sound is,  and then we're going to talk to these guys.  What do you think this is?  I have no idea. 
[01:28:30]  Well, we heard something like that.  I thought it was the Atlanta woman that stomps on graves. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, it's one of the best ones ever.  Yeah, we were talking about that in the green room.  The Atlanta woman.  The grave stomping.  You played that, though, didn't you?  Yeah, and she falls down and gets the wind knocked out of her,  but she can't.  And they're still playing the bad music behind it,  and they don't know she's near death.  Oh, oh.  Do we have the whole clip we should play?  Oh, and the anchors, when they come back to them,  they're like, yeah, oh.  Because they can't be regular people.  Oh, that's terrible.  Yeah, I hope she's okay.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  And then, anyway.  I feel genuine.  I don't know what that clip is.  I have no idea.  We got the gang from Cloverfield in studio.  You're not going to tell us?  Yeah, after the interview or whatever.  As we go to break.  We'll talk about it.  Yeah, so most of us saw Cloverfield in this studio,  and we all loved it.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, we're happy.  We all loved it.  I wasn't a fan of the shaky camera work.  Who was behind the camera?  That was me.  Oh, boy, do I want to slap you.  That's great.  My goal was to make people have a visceral reaction  to the situation of a large attack on New York  and have motion sickness. 
[01:30:00]  They got motion sickness.  Oh, did he?  Good.  So if those two things happen,  then I feel like I did my job.  Right, exactly.  Now, I've been thinking about it ever since I saw the movie  that Jay Abrams and the rest of the gang behind this movie,  they were very aware that the shaky camera work  would affect some people,  but I think that's also part of the experience.  You should probably sit in the back of the theater.  I know.  I guess that's what we should tell people,  because where Jimmy sat, he wasn't affected.  It was in the last row I saw it.  You don't see the walls in either side.  Or take some gravel or something.  That's good advice, though,  because a lot of people are going to go see the movie this weekend. 
[01:30:30]  If you're a wimp like me,  go to the back of the theater,  and it might not affect you.  It's not as bad if you sit in the back.  It really isn't.  I think you also, you know,  you get into it.  Like, once you've seen it for about 20 minutes,  you sort of get used to the way that it's shot,  and hopefully don't get sick during this.  Sick during the week.  There's people going over with patches behind their ears  and those dumb wristbands.  There's going to be five people seated  and, like, 300 crammed into the back  like a porno theater.  Those guys cruising each other with coats.  It has that effect of a porno theater, I think. 
[01:31:00]  I really liked it, though, man.  It's like I had heard, just like,  it's a monster movie, kind of.  You didn't know what to expect.  And I'm very rarely on the edge of my seat  when I watch a film.  There's small seats, though, too.  They're very...  They really weren't tiny.  I was kind of, you know,  my ass was hanging the popcorn on the floor.  But it was really...  Everything to me was unexpected about it.  I had no idea what the thing looked like.  I had no idea where it was going to go.  And we're obviously not going to give away the ending,  but let's just say it wasn't a typical Hollywood thing.  So it was really, really interesting film. 
[01:31:30]  The whole movie's not typical of Hollywood.  Do you guys want to explain  the basic premise of Cloverfield?  Somebody, just to get everyone on board?  Yeah, it's about a group of friends  who are throwing a going-away party  for a buddy there.  She's going to Japan,  and then some shit goes down.  Oh, hey.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, yeah, okay.  It's like...  Hey, good morning, New York City.  Sorry.  That's all right.  So, baby...  Can't say Japan.  Oh, don't say it again.  We just got the delivery.  So, uh...  Oh, wait a minute. 
[01:32:00]  So, basically, there's a going-away party.  Yeah, there's a going-away party.  There's an explosion in Manhattan.  We don't know what's going on,  and you're following this group of friends  as they go through the city  trying to survive this night.  So it's, you know,  this kind of survivor movie.  And what you talk about,  I mean, it is intense.  It's an experience, I think,  more than a lot,  maybe a lot of movies,  first-hand experience  to go through the movie.  And what we try to do  while making it  is you just really stay true  to the idea  that that is a character  holding the camera.  He is there with it.  So, you know,  as much as we want to tell the story  of what the movie is,  you can't too conveniently 
[01:32:30]  catch the moments,  and it has to feel like  he's really there.  He's whipping his head  to see what you're seeing.  And they didn't have to cheat  as much as you'd think  to get that video camera feeling,  which I love.  Because it's a movie,  so you still have to explain  exactly what's going on  and what happens,  and you have to show footage.  But it really did feel  like a guy is videotaping,  which I thought was brilliant  the way that was shot.  Who the director of photography was.  And a guy really was videotaping,  because I shot  about a third of the film.  I actually held the camera  throughout it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I think we all did. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  At one point or another.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was a really,  you know,  we tried to convey that  and we didn't really realistically.  And they really,  they were strongly saying,  sometimes I do shots  and at the end of it,  the director would comp and go,  yeah, they just,  it looked too good.  That wouldn't look like that  if you were spinning around  and trying to catch something  that just happened, yeah.  We tried to make it look  as real as we could.  It's amazing how much,  like, I don't know why  this movie has this  really weird buzz around it. 
[01:33:30]  Like, you don't hear as much  about a movie  before it comes out  like this one.  It's like,  I just remember driving  on 10th Avenue  and seeing it.  It's a great marketing.  The poster for it  is really great.  So it immediately makes you  want to know,  why is the Statue of Liberty  headless?  That's what the poster is.  She's a mess  or whatever she is.  It's really,  really well marketed  and I was interested  in this movie  before I'd ever seen  a commercial for it  just because of the  guerrilla marketing.  Yeah, there was some kind  of hype behind it  before it came out  and I read something  that was really horrible 
[01:34:00]  that, thank God,  didn't come to fruition  for you guys.  It was like,  the hype,  is this the next  Snakes on a Plane?  Oh God.  Oh yeah.  I was like,  we tried for that.  Yeah, you tried.  Originally,  there were snakes  attacking you.  It just didn't fit  and we couldn't get  Samuel L. Jackson  to say,  I want to get  these mother...  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean,  we didn't,  I think that was  what all of us  were worried about  is that there's  so much hype  surrounding it  and there's so many 
[01:34:30]  people on the internet  talking about it,  asking about it.  But when you finally  see the movie,  I think it lives  up to the hype  and it's different.  It's different than,  I think even the trailer  makes you think  you're going to see  this huge action film  and it is,  but it isn't at all.  It's not that movie  where the president  is like,  we've got to figure out  a way to take  this thing down.  Where's it from?  Get the military.  That doesn't come into play.  It's much more about  these six characters  and how they deal  with the craziest event 
[01:35:00]  you could imagine  happening.  There was a great sense  of isolation in the movie  or panic,  which I like  because most movies,  again,  maybe when they're shot  like typical movies  don't give you that,  but there's a thing  where you go up  to Columbus Circle  and it was just creepy.  It was just a creepy,  because I live right by there,  and it was just a really  nice effect to have  which most movies  don't give you  when they're shot.  That's because we had  no clue what was happening  as we were doing it.  So, I mean, it was...  What was the script like?  Were you guys totally scripted?  They didn't tell you a lot? 
[01:35:30]  You know, we improv'd  so much of the film.  We ripped a bunch of stuff  and none of us saw the script  before we signed on  because it was so secretive.  Literally five days  before we started filming  is when we finally  got to read a script.  I mean, the trailer was shot  before we...  The trailer came out  in front of Transformers  that everyone saw.  We were maybe two days  into the actual filming  of the movie at that point.  Wow.  And we just found out  who we were playing.  And that trailer came out  before the script  had been finished.  Yeah.  You know, so it was very much 
[01:36:00]  the whole concept of this movie  and the marketing campaign  was that was at the outset  they had that idea.  And then when figuring out  the movie was kind of  happening on the fly  in a lot of ways.  It really was.  And we didn't...  You know, we had no idea  what...  This is a...  It was a totally  different approach  to make...  I mean, to shoot a teaser  before you shoot the film.  That never happens.  And so it was exciting...  I mean, it was exciting  and it was strange  to find out  that I wasn't going  to be on camera at all.  That was exciting.  But when you were, 
[01:36:30]  when you were,  it paid off nicely, though.  There was a few really...  That's right, yeah.  Really great shots.  You really cherish  those two and a half minutes.  You really, really...  Take it all in, right?  Yeah, take all of it.  That's all I got.  That's all I want to give you.  All of you are pretty much  just kind of fighting  your way up the ranks  and trying to get gigs  and stuff,  which is kind of great  that they didn't get  any quote-unquote  really big names for it  because then it's like  an ensemble cast.  You're not concentrating  just on one person.  Yeah, I think if it had been...  If anybody recognizable  had been in the film, 
[01:37:00]  then it wouldn't have had  that feeling of being as real.  Yeah, you're just like,  hey, he was in that other movie.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, if you can suspend  your disbelief  and believe that you are  watching a tape  that the government found,  I think that's the ultimate  experience of the movie  that we tried to have.  So, yeah, you needed to have  people that you don't  really recognize.  And that's not going to happen  if you have Jerry O'Connell  in it.  Yeah, right.  It's like, hey, wait,  he's the guy from Sliders.  That's a great reference.  Sliders.  The subway tunnel scene.  Wow.  That was intense, right? 
[01:37:30]  That was really, really good.  And it came in at,  like, relatively speaking,  pretty low budget  for a movie of that scope.  You know, you're wrecking New York.  I mean, that kind of takes  a lot of money these days.  $25 million, she said,  for the whole movie.  $25 million.  That's it.  Opie's got that in his pocket  right now.  It pretty much all went  to the special effects,  I think.  Yeah, it was cast.  If we didn't have  any special effects at all.  It didn't go to the cast?  No.  No.  If we didn't have  special effects,  we could have made it  for, like, $2 million, probably. 
[01:38:00]  They were good.  The effects were really good.  Those are the guys  that really made that film  as the visual effects guys.  I mean, so much of it  was done.  You'd step on the set.  I mean, like,  the Brooklyn Bridge stuff.  They literally,  they made a 100-foot section  of the walking path  on the Brooklyn Bridge,  and then it was just  wrapped in a green screen.  And they literally  went in hours beforehand  and put little tiny  orange X's all over the place  because you have one camera  that's whipping  all over God's green earth  and there's no way 
[01:38:30]  of having a perspective  as to where you are.  And so they used those things  to tell where they were  when they laid in  New York behind it.  And it came,  I mean,  I was amazed  at how flawlessly...  When you see it  and you've spent  all this time  working in these weird  studios and stuff,  you're like,  this is the movie I'm in?  This is crazy.  And when you're shooting  these scenes,  like in the subway  with a special effects  scene partner,  let's just say,  you feel like a moron.  You know what I mean?  Flashing around  or doing whatever. 
[01:39:00]  But what I found is,  like,  the bigger you go,  you're giving a gift  to the animator  because then they can  really use that.  But on the day,  you feel like...  So you just got to  act your way through that.  You just got to...  And then they added  that other stuff  in afterwards,  obviously.  You're fighting nothing  in real life.  Right, right.  Obviously.  Yeah.  We were discussing that.  It didn't seem like  you guys were on a  soundstage at all  in this movie.  That's so crazy.  I mean...  Were you on location  in New York  for some of the big scenes?  We only shot  about a week and a half  in New York.  Wow.  That's it.  You can't tell,  though,  they did such a good job 
[01:39:30]  at filling in New York  with special effects people  because it's unbelievable.  We shot a lot  on soundstage,  more than you would think.  Yeah, we had a lot...  I mean, a lot of it  that you see  and looks like New York  was all done  in Los Angeles.  I mean, it looks great.  Michael's right.  It was as much  of a surprise  for us to see the film,  I think,  as a lot of people  who've never seen it before  because it just looks...  You know,  it's got the quality  special effects  of something like  Transformers,  but, you know,  it's completely different. 
[01:40:00]  Was it a bunch  of young, geeky,  like, special effects guys?  They're all hot girls.  All hot girls.  Cool.  Just naked.  It's like they cut up cocaine.  They're all just nude  in a room with gloves on.  Coppolis with gloves  doing cocaine  and creating giant  juice vegetables.  Because I've seen, like,  people that are just amateurs  that do amazing work  and you can see it online,  you know,  and it seems like  that's the thing to do  these days  is get some young hot shots  that know how to work 
[01:40:30]  some of these programs  and they do amazing stuff.  I mean,  they definitely knew  how to work the programs.  I mean, it was great.  Lock them in a room  and, you know,  I mean,  lock them in a room  for six months.  I mean,  the turnaround on this  was insane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  For these guys, you know?  I mean, so they were...  Yeah, it would take years  for a big budget movie  to pop out special effects.  I think what we're saying  is we just, you know,  this was,  the movie was done  on a weekend.  That's how much  Paramount carried out.  Hey, there you go.  Hey, why Cloverfield,  by the way?  Like you're sitting here  and it's just up on the TV.  Yeah.  One of the cast members  was on that this morning. 
[01:41:00]  Would you say  why Cloverfield?  Yeah, because obviously  that has not much to do  with the actual movie.  Well, yeah.  I mean,  they bounced around.  We had all these  secretive names  while we were filming  so that nobody would know.  JJ was very secretive  about it, you know,  coming from...  He wanted to control  the info coming out,  obviously.  And so for a while  it was called Cheese  and then it was called  Chocolate Outrage.  Chocolate Outrage?  Yeah.  Chocolate Outrage.  I wish they would have  gone with Chocolate Outrage. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, John Singleton film.  But yeah,  I mean,  they kind of finally,  they settled on Cloverfield,  which was one of these  code names  and it does,  it has something to do  with the film.  Once you see the opening  of the film,  you see how it relates to it.  But they actually,  I don't care,  they were going to call it  Monstrous.  That was an idea for it.  And they printed  10,000 posters  that said Monstrous on it  and the internet, 
[01:42:00]  like the geek mafia  went crazy.  They were like,  this has got to be fake.  They had our backs  on that one, you know?  They really did.  And so they changed the name  and they didn't know  what to do with these posters.  So they printed out  like 10,000 more  that said like,  scary.  Terrifying.  Terrifying.  It's all adjectives.  Oh, that's right.  Really scary.  Worth seeing.  Monstrous.  It's like the name  of an HBO documentary  on obesity. 
[01:42:30]  Morbidity.  Morbid obesity.  Hey, it's funny,  the effects are so important  because I saw The Mist.  We had,  what was that guy's name  that directed The Mist?  He's what?  Airbont?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, right.  The Stephen King, yeah.  And he said he was  on a very low budget  and I think he was  kind of preparing people  because it was a really  good movie  and the characters  were very interesting  but the special effects  were like,  and it was a really  interesting movie  and it was like  a sock puppet  coming and attacking people.  It was right.  You guys did a great job  with the effects on that  even though I know  you didn't do it.  Well, half the budget 
[01:43:00]  went to special effects  and that's,  the thing is,  I've been telling people  it's like The Mist  in that The Mist,  the thing that I liked  the most about it  was not the special effects.  It was what happens  to these people  when this thing,  you know,  occurs  and that's what's cool  about this movie  is you really,  it focuses on the characters.  It's not,  you know,  the special effects  and all that.  They're great  but that's not  the focus of the film.  Yeah,  the characters  were really interesting people. 
[01:43:30]  It was like  there were certain things  that were shot  like at a party,  let's just say  there's an argument  between two people  who slept together  and the way it was shot,  you get that information though  in a way that like,  you know,  just a jackass  filming at a party  would give you  that information.  We've all been at that party.  I am that jackass.  Right.  Hey,  is there any talk  about a sequel?  Not that we know of,  yeah.  Not for most of us.  We've been filming it  for four months now.  It's already in the works.  Yeah.  How would that work?  I don't know.  I think once you see  this movie,  you'll probably think 
[01:44:00]  the sequel goes up  pretty quickly.  I wasn't sure  you wanted me to say that,  but there's definitely,  yeah,  I figured there could be  a way to kind of like  make another movie  that maybe answers  some of these questions  and maybe they go  a completely different direction  and actually film  an actual Hollywood  quote movie  with the same concept  using the tape  that we see in this movie.  Or a musical.  Make it a musical.  They're taking the cast  from American Pie 2.  The monster singing  and fun,  you know. 
[01:44:30]  Hollywood.  What's like the biggest  parts you've had?  You have to,  you have to,  he's winning.  What's the biggest  parts you've had  before this movie?  Before this?  Yeah.  I'm not that big.  I've done a couple  other movies.  Come on,  say the one that you've done.  Come on.  What movie?  One called  She's the Man.  Yes.  Yes.  I knew you looked familiar.  Oh, really?  Huge Amanda Bynes fan.  What is She's the Man?  Is that a big film?  I don't know.  Well, it was a movie,  it was like a take 
[01:45:00]  on Twelfth Night  with Amanda Bynes.  She dresses up as a guy  on a soccer team  and yeah.  It was more like  for the young,  like the 12,  13 year old.  A girl dressed like a guy.  Comedy like that, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Difficult look.  Not a guy dressed like a girl  like you're used to.  Oh, no, no.  Cruising around the streets  for you.  We've all made errors.  Okay, so that was your  Yeah, what about you?  I'm on this TV show,  it's called October Road  on ABC. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  See, that's nothing  to sneeze at,  as they say.  How many episodes  do you have?  The writer's strike is really...  You know, our writers  are so amazing.  They wrote our whole  13 episode order,  so we're finished  shooting now  and we have  seven more episodes there.  Yeah.  Because then you can't  do the rewrites.  If you have to shoot now,  there's no rewrites.  Exactly.  Either improv it  or it doesn't get shot right now.  Yeah, they got all of them out.  It was amazing.  Oh, cool.  How about yourself?  I had a film come out  I guess two summer ago 
[01:46:00]  called Poseidon.  Oh, all right.  Big Giant Boat.  I think we heard about that one.  A bunch of chainsaw massacre,  a bunch of other things.  Yeah.  Oh, did you get to talk  to Arlie Ermey?  I did.  That's what took us out  of the film  was him in that movie  because all you're seeing  is Sergeant Hartman.  Yeah.  He did the entire  full metal jacket.  Oh, he loves doing that speech.  The entire thing.  He's obsessed with that.  He did it for us  and threw all our names  in the rant. 
[01:46:30]  I mean, the most vulgar man  I've ever met in my life  and I could not keep  a straight face  the entire time  we were filming.  Which is good  for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Yeah, just to be giggling  and fun.  What?  Family film.  Who are you in Poseidon?  Because I saw that.  I don't really remember it as much.  I know it was a shorter movie  but you worked with Dreyfuss.  There were some cool people  in the movie.  I played  Kurt Russell's future  son in the hall.  I thought you looked familiar.  Oh, wow.  Great drowning scene he did too.  How creepy was that? 
[01:47:00]  Phenomenal.  That was awful.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Felt like I couldn't breathe  watching that.  I know.  I think I have emphysema  because I swim in the pool  and I'll hold my breath  for half the pool  and I actually thought  of that scene  and I'm like,  ugh.  I like half the pool.  I saw a lot of people  as they were watching it  they'd catch themselves  holding their breath  in every underwater scene  and everything  I thought it was interesting.  Yeah,  because it was really  it's a much better shot  than the original  which you know  big fat Shelly Winters  being dragged out  in stockings. 
[01:47:30]  Any of those movies  where they have to go under  and through tunnels  and stuff  I would just be like  I'd be dead.  I would just die.  There's no way  you're going to be that  pumped up with adrenaline  and be able to hold your breath  longer than like three seconds.  These movies are creepy.  You were in a couple  of big films.  How about yourself?  Me?  Not many movies.  In high school  I did this movie  called Newport South  which was pretty bad  but I had a small part  I played a football player  I had like three lines  you know  it was like  we were talking about  I had some lines like 
[01:48:00]  what kind of bag  was my line  and my favorite thing  of watching the movie  was like  I spent two and a half weeks  on set  missed school  got to hang out  on the set  with all these hot  extra girls  and just sleep a lot  and there's this frame  like in the lunchroom scene  I'm in the corner  like giving my friend  a high five  I just like to freeze it  and like look at that  and be like  I got pain  so no  not in many movies  this is a big one  How'd you get this one?  Just auditioned  Black Donnelly's  Black Donnelly's  Black Donnelly's  Good show man  Thank you man  Really good show 
[01:48:30]  I've been the youngest brother  Sean Donnelly  Yeah okay  What's that on?  I've not seen that  Came and went my friend  Yeah unfortunately  It's hard for you to see it  unless you buy the DVD  It's too bad  Yeah  It was right after  Lucky Louie  Oh boy yeah  I know that feeling  Yeah  I was gonna say  you get it on TV  Yeah I'm a pop culture  zilch though  I don't know pop culture  very well at all  and I know I was reading  a lot of the bios  I know you did improv  Yeah I did  I was Second City  I came out to Los Angeles  for  I'm on Carpoolers  which is on ABC  and other situations  Jerry Mine is a buddy of mine 
[01:49:00]  Yeah he's hilarious  and that's another situation  where we had 13 episodes  and the writer's strike  kind of froze us up  but that's on  right now on Tuesdays  on ABC  and that was it  I did a lot of stand up  and improv  and I auditioned for this  when I auditioned for it  they had this like  really heartfelt monologue  you know  about this guy  and how his father  used to keep a diary  in the military  and all this stuff  and I finished  and the cast director  was like  that was really good  it was also not 
[01:49:30]  the right sides  for you to do  so we're gonna get you  the right stuff  but they wanted  they wanted  a sort of  a comedic perspective  to be one of the characters  and that's what I  you know  try and bring  you guys are gonna be  recognized starting tomorrow man  they are  I'll have  I know  that voiceover job  that's gotta piss you off  a little bit  I gotta get it  I'm looking to get  an all state campaign  you've got a lot  a lot  recognize you TJ  oh yeah  I wanna  I was  I was joking  that you know  if this movie's huge  these people are all  gonna get recognized

[02:00:30]  but you know  look it's a career move  right  Beth and Lily  in a big movie  I don't know their real names  I mean I know  I just called them  hey  so we got word  that there's a big meeting  here at K-Rock  here in New York City  the station we broadcast from  how funny it would be  if Tom came out of the closet  hysterical  yeah because of a certain  arrest  that was gonna hit the papers  in Westchester  and you know  harassment by police officers  and arrest 
[02:01:00]  stopped in  and used the rest area  there was a misunderstanding  well Tom  finally came in  and admitted  that there's a meeting  going on  at 9 o'clock  here at K-Rock  and we got the audio  from Tom  stopping in  earlier  this morning  oh this is  when we were talking  about the meeting  yeah listen closely  he gave everything away  did he  Tom  you got everybody wondering  why weren't we invited  to the big meeting today  huh  you were invited 
[02:01:30]  alright good  invited  is it a good meeting  no no no  oh  good for the station  oh yeah  you know  it's not gonna upset  anybody's lives  and everyone will  go on  are you retiring  no no no  god  is this show  safe for now  no  oh no  good morning  alright  can you answer this  is that the last  good morning  we're gonna have  oh yeah  my grand muffins  are getting cold  can you eat it  oh no 
[02:02:00]  oh no  alright boys  alright thanks  there was supposed  to be something else  ah  let my people go  do you know  if I wasn't here  for that  I would have thought  with that flawless  splicing together  yes yes  that wasn't splicing  Jimmy  what do you mean  oh no  they were dumping  out of the important  information weren't they  oh that must have  been it  that was  hence the sound  of uh  where it sounds  like it's  jumping around  they dumped out  of that  I gotta tell you 
[02:02:30]  the uh  I think they do  a better job  with the beep game  it was almost like  what did you take  like nursing scissors  and duct tape  we wanted to go  for the uh  the bad edit there  I know  hey uh  one more story  before we get  out of here  it was a really  interesting story  a boy  calls 911  his mommy's  having a uh  a real problem  and uh  well  it didn't uh  it didn't turn out 
[02:03:00]  too well  listen to this  in detroit  a 911 operator  is on trial  because she assumed  that a call  from a little boy  was a prank  Robert Turner  was just five years  old when he placed  this call to 911  pleading for help  his mother had  collapsed on the  kitchen floor  the first operator  assumed he was  a prankster  and did not  send assistance  three hours later  the boy called  back and was  scolded a second 
[02:03:30]  time by another  operator  I don't care  you shouldn't be  playing on the  phone  now put her on  the phone  before I  send the police  out there to  knock on the  door and you  won't be in  trouble  but by the time  the second  dispatcher did  send police  Robert's 46  year old mother  Cheryl Turner  was dead of an  enlarged heart  oh what what  kind of is there  a screening process  for 911 
[02:04:00]  no because every  time there's a  problem they always  sound like blithering  idiots and any time  there's a problem  that makes the news  there's a screw up  it's always that  woman oh my god  they read an ad in  the paper does your  personality suck do you  not know how to figure  how serious the  situation really is  if so you're  qualified to be a  911 operator  have you ever been  in the middle of  something and you  realize there's nothing  funny showing up at  all  that's just happened 
[02:04:30]  to me  I was already caught  in that dead end  character  and they're trying to  get out  but no  there's a little more  to the story  spiraled  I just want my  mama back  I'm not so happy  the two operators  were eventually  charged with willful  neglect of duty  the first time  any 911 operator  in this country  has faced criminal  charges  in court  those charges  were dropped  against the second  operator  19 year veteran 
[02:05:00]  Terry Sutton  I didn't believe  that it was going  to even go that way  Robert's relatives  are very unhappy  with the decision  my nephew had to  suffer losses  so I just feel  it wasn't right  I told her  that my mom died  what did she say  to you  stop playing  on the phone  the trial  is slated  to continue  for the first  operator  to answer  Robert's call  for help  Sharon Nichols  nationally  one in four  911 calls  are pranks  according to the 
[02:05:30]  union representing  the operators  still  I feel horrible  for the family  especially for the  young man  who lost his mom  at such an early age  a tragic lesson  to be learned  from a young boy's  calls for help  it's really  25%  this is one  in four  of all 911  calls are pranks  that's weird  because  we all made  prank calls  growing up  right  911 was always  off limits  that was the  off limit  that's what  I'm getting at  you were scared  to go down  that road  I think that's  kind of a lie  yeah that's 
[02:06:00]  what I'm getting  at  one out of four  no way  no way  you know how  many 911  calls come in  every day  what do they  mean by a  prank call  yeah is it  somebody  is a prank  just like  a false  alarm  or is it  somebody saying  hey could you  go down to the  deli and get me  a sandwich  I'm hungry  do you have  10 pound balls  that type of  prank  or is it  just people  that don't  know what  911 is for  right  this is a go  until you  call up  and you say  hey is your  refrigerator running 
[02:06:30]  and when they  say yes  you say like  whoa  better catch it  better catch it  be dangerous  running down the  street  Prince Albert  in a can  ah  yeah  when they  say yeah  you say  why would you  want to put a  hoop earring  through that  but why  would  why would  911 say  they did  have Prince  Albert  in a can  because they  they just may  want to hear  where you're  going with it  they'd probably  say no we  don't  and then you'd 
[02:07:00]  be stuck  good point  Andrew  that's okay  911 what's  your emergency  do you have  Prince Albert  in a can  no  then don't  let him  out  do you know  somebody who  does  and their  number and  contact information  I don't know  why when the  first 911  character bombed  I decided to  just reinvent  it  why not  bring it back  to life  hey we're  going to try  to get this  into we've  been sitting  on this for  a while  we got  David Lee  Roth audio  oh yes  his vocals 
[02:07:30]  isolated when he  was trying to  do what  running with  the devil  in studio  was it  running with  the devil  yeah  I believe  this is actual  audio of  David Lee  Roth  I guess  wasn't used  on the  song  I don't  know  it could  have been  used on  the song  it's just  the raw  tracks  okay  David Lee  Roth  that's  doesn't help  the bit  well  off to a  slow start  yeah  oh god  I just like  isolated  there was a 
[02:08:00]  reason we sat  on this I  think  oh god  a little  better  these  these would  be  a little  better  hold on  not getting  much better  sense of that  lady that hit  her head on  the soap  dish  yeah  god damn  it baby  no I ain't  lying to you  I'm only  gonna tell you  one time  that's pretty  much what it  sounds like  behind the music  why do we  hung in there 
[02:08:30]  I love  isolated  vocals  they rock  and finally  all right 
[02:09:00]  well  that worked  I'm glad  thanks Steve  we shouldn't  have sat on  that  that was  yeah  that should  have been  you know  and that's  how you  executive  produce  I guess  we felt  like bringing  the average  of the show  down a bit  huh  we were  doing too  well there  today  went from  an A to  a C plus  I thought  I was gonna  do A minus  didn't you  all right

[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  Thank you. 
[02:21:30]  Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!  No prob.  Hi, Opie and Anthony live at XM Satellite Radio.  We had a little meeting at the other place that we broadcast from.  A huge meeting, actually, in a conference room.  Yeah, we walked in.  Yeah, we walked in.  There was everyone from the station.  Everyone from our station in New York, KROQ, 92.3 KROQ.  And it needs to be known that the last ratings book, we did very well, extremely well in the ratings. 
[02:22:00]  Number one in our demo, men 18 to 49, but the rest of the station sucks dick.  And with that, they are changing formats.  And, well, this will make a lot of people happy out there.  Well, there's no way to say it.  They're going country.  Yep.  I, Opie, I'm in shock because I don't know how the fuck that's going to work for us. 
[02:22:30]  I don't know how it affects us.  We won't have to play any music.  It's going to be the same thing.  You know, we're going to be a talk show.  Right.  But the personalities later in the day, the music, it's going to be country.  And we have no clue how we're going to interact with that or promote this show during the rest of the show  or promote the rest of the station during our show because it's just so out there. 
[02:23:00]  It doesn't, it doesn't jibe.  And the radio world, well, the New York radio world, New York radio message board, especially,  they argue about a country station in New York and if it could possibly work.  Yeah.  Well, they're going to give it a shot.  Yep.  They figured.  And there was no one in the meeting that could give us any answers to our questions.  So we'll have to sit and wait. 
[02:23:30]  And they did that.  It's still, you know, up in the air as far as details go on, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And we're like, well, how does this affect us?  Right.  You know, but they know best, Opie.  They know best.  They said after our show Monday that we're sitting down and talking to some people.  So we'll see what that fucking means.  On Monday.  On Monday.  I guess that, you know, we kind of like having relevant band members in there.  Now, what are we going to have to interview country stars? 
[02:24:00]  Because the rest of the radio's audience isn't going to want to hear us, you know, maybe  talking to Lars or something.  Right.  We're fucked.  Going to have to brush up on our country.  We're fucked.  I don't know anything about country music.  Well, I know a lot of people are wondering what the meeting was about.  That's what it was about.  That's all we know.  Yeah.  And I guess we'll find out more after Monday's show. 
[02:24:30]  Hop along, Howie.  Someone's writing.  Yeah.  That's definitely the.  Believe me, that popped into my mind when I heard it.  Like, oh, we're going to have to wear the hat.  Well, that's why when Tom came in today, I was joking about the cowboy hats and stuff.  But I really wasn't.  I was because I've heard some some rumblings.  Yeah.  That they were thinking of changing formats.  And I'm like, well, what the fuck could they try next?  They've tried to talk.  They brought that brought back K rocket and it didn't work too well.  And I'm like, well, the Spanish stations, there's too many of those already. 
[02:25:00]  So I threw the country angle in there because I'm like, come on, you're not going to try  the dumb country thing.  A little foreshadowing on my part.  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening.  Well, we'll see.  We'll get more details Monday.  But that's where we stand right now.  And Frank, the trucker saying country will help.  Maybe you.  Maybe you.  And your musical preference.  If I was a betting man, I would say that we're going to be moved to another station because  I can't think.  How the fuck would that?  Fresh. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's the problem.  What on the station?  Yeah.  So we'll find out more on Monday, I'm sure.  And we'll let you know what the what the fuck's going on.  But moving on to to to something really cool.  TJ Miller, who plays HUD in Cloverfield, just blew off all the his interviews to hang with  us.  Fuck him.  Right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  No joke.  I heard you get cursed on this show.  So I said, yeah, it is.  It's the curse show.  We had the cast of Cloverfield come in for the other side of the show. 
[02:26:00]  And I got this feeling when we were talking to you.  I'm like, I think this guy wants to hang with us today.  He doesn't want to deal with a press junket.  And I'm like, I think he's going to come back.  I think he's going to come next time.  So what happened?  You guys were at the Essex house doing a press junket?  Yeah, we are.  We're going to.  You know, we're going to go over there.  There's like a lot of press from 12 to 5.  The thing is, the movie was so secretive.  And so at the outset, we haven't done any press.  Yeah.  So just today, they're going to have us do everything at once.  Right.  That was the big thing was nobody was allowed to talk about the film. 
[02:26:30]  Remember when I first got in it, they said, you can't tell anybody you're in this  movie.  You can't tell anybody what it's about.  And I got drunk at a bar and talked to somebody that worked on the trailer but not on the  film.  And it got back to Paramount.  And they called.  Hey, what's up?  Holy shit.  Hey, the teaser looks good.  We just wanted to talk to you about some of your habits in the public.  And one of those would be getting shit faced and talking about the movie.  And that's not okay.  And we need to let you know that.  So they were really, really kind of watchdogs in that sense with the secrecy of the film. 
[02:27:00]  So that was, so that's why we're doing a huge push today.  Wow.  And we fell in love, obviously, with the two girls, as I'm sure you guys had.  Very attractive.  Did they talk about us after you guys left?  Yeah.  A couple of them.  Right.  They were drawing.  They were putting Opie and Anthony and Jim and then they were last names.  They were sort of writing those over and over and putting hearts next to it.  Yes.  So I think you guys really scored in that sense. 
[02:27:30]  We're in.  How did Opie do in that?  Opie and.  It was Opie Usterman and Anthony Lucas.  And it was Jim Staldavid.  I don't know why.  I don't know how that.  I don't know if you gave that vibe.  He had the lead, though, right?  He did.  That's right.  I'm a little curse.  Where's the money?  The money was with Michael Staldavid.  Yeah.  I mean, it was crazy.  I'm a huge Lizzie Kaplan fan and she wasn't on the show because I guess she was doing  the CW.  Yeah.  We saw her on the CW after you guys left. 
[02:28:00]  She was very good in the movie, though, man.  She was fucking good.  Yeah.  I think she's great.  And she's super, super funny.  She was in Mean Girls and I'm doing a project coming up with her.  That's how I fucking know her.  I don't want to admit that I saw that movie, but Mean Girls.  No, it was a good movie.  It was a good movie, right?  It was a good movie.  All right, Dan, get on mic.  It was a good movie, right?  Yeah, it was a good movie.  It was almost a chick flick.  I think it went to chick flick.  I don't think it was even almost.  But yeah, she's awesome in that.  She's really, I think, really good in the movie. 
[02:28:30]  Is she a goer?  How do you know?  She goes all the...  Yeah.  Yeah, I think she is.  Did anybody hook up in that movie?  Let's get to the real questions.  I think Mike Vogel and Michael Staldavid may have had something.  Oh.  Let's start that real.  Sexy.  Let's get some TMZ stuff done today.  Come on.  That was the...  Odette Eusterman is engaged.  Lizzie Kaplan is dating...  Yeah, I'll go for it.  She'll never hear that.  Matthew Perry.  Oh.  From Friends?  From Friends fam. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  Really?  Does anyone know that?  You know, there's rumors.  There's rumors of it, but she...  But it's definite.  I mean, yeah, I think they're not...  You just got us on the TMZ page, baby!  Send it off!  But it's funny.  I feel like he's dating up.  That's what I'm saying.  I can't really, really.  Because she's so, so funny.  So good.  And then Jessica Lucas is single, but she lives in Vancouver.  So I think everybody's kind of staying away from that.  I heard that Canadian kind of thing come out.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So Lily is single.  Lily is single. 
[02:29:30]  All right, cool.  I liked her.  She was very good.  Yeah.  You loved her, right?  Yeah, I loved all of them.  So what are you going to do, Jim?  Any three that showed interest.  Now what are you going to do about that?  What steps are you now going to take to make that work?  I'll tell them my Vancouver hooker story.  I got one once.  Tell TJ.  I got blown from my life.  I was with a bunch of sober people, and we were going to Seattle.  Any story that begins like that, I love it.  I was with a bunch of sober people.  And I was walking around Vancouver, and I got blown in an alley.  I had 80 American dollars left. 
[02:30:00]  And the girl blew me for 60, and then her friend's like, I'll let you pat my bum for 20.  Her friend just kind of helped her out and jerked me off, and I rubbed her ass.  So my last 80, I was blown.  And this guy who was also sober, who I think had a much bigger dick, because the hooker's  like, ooh.  They were commenting on his dick size.  He got blown next to me.  Poor Jim.  But after fucking Kenny Quickcomb finished, then the one came over with fucking seed breath  and said, I could rubber bump the point.  Really enchanting experience.  Kenny Quickcomb.  I was like, he said 80 American dollars. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, American.  It was going to be 100 Canadian, but because he had the 80 American dollars, you got jerked  off in an hour.  Now I got a problem with TJ.  Why?  He just gave us some top secret info, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's on the front page of TMZ.  We were hoping for a scoop.  Matthew Perry's student body hookup.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, my God.  Wow, news travels fast.  Wow, I guess they listened to the show.  Jesus.  They had the picture already and everything.  It's at the top of the page. 
[02:31:00]  Here, let me see.  Can I see it?  You know what?  It's a small website.  No one's going to see it there.  That's funny.  It's the front page.  Is he much older than her?  I would say yes.  Yeah.  There you go.  So someone else is blabbing today.  But it's amazing how like...  When was that?  It's like, when was that?  No, no, no.  It was...  Damn it.  It's supposed to be a secret.  So she's engaged.  What's her name?  Odette Yussman.  Odette Yussman.  She's Latin, right?  She is.  She's engaged to Trevor... 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I think she's had an actor who has done...  He was on the George Lopez show and MXP, Most Extreme Primate.  Have you guys seen that?  It's about a snowboarding monkey.  Get into it, I think.  You guys have all...  Everybody, yeah.  Wait, what's the show?  He was in a movie called MXP, Most Extreme Primate.  But, you know, he's a really good guy.  And it actually was one of the best things about the George Lopez show.  Is he, like, a really handsome L.A. actor, though?  Yeah, super.  And he has a faux hawk.  You guys look a little bit alike. 
[02:32:00]  I have no shot with a chick dating out like that.  Could you do a faux hawk?  Yeah, I'll do it now.  Get fucking...  Get clippers.  You can cut it now.  All right.  Get the...  It's not shaved.  Just, you know, shaved down.  Not to skin.  On the side.  I want it to be close to skin, though.  And then I'll just leave the fucking middle.  I don't care.  All right, yeah, let's do that.  Who could do that today for Jimmy?  You want a chick to do it, right?  I don't care.  Who can do it without fucking decapitating it?  Yes.  Hey, TJ's in.  He's kind of bummed out because the New York Times gave Cloverfield a bad review. 
[02:32:30]  Now, it's got to be said right off the bat that most of the reviews are really good for this movie, TJ.  Really good.  USA Today was into it.  I mean, it was...  What's bumming you out about the New York Times?  Well, the New York Times said, and I kind of agree with them,  the movie's unbelievable.  It's hard to believe.  You know, honestly, they're fucking right.  It is.  The second that I saw that there was a giant creature attacking New York City, 
[02:33:00]  I'm in the movie.  I still...  I didn't believe it.  I felt like it was a movie.  I felt like it wasn't really found footage, like it's purporting to be.  Right, right.  No, but they got really down on it.  I luckily...  I was described as a dimwit.  That's always nice.  Which is great.  A dimwit.  Well, you're supposed to be this fucking guy at a party who's filming a monster.  I mean, what do they expect?  These smarmy jizzbags fucking hate the Times.  Fuck the Times.  Yeah, but that's what we're trying to tell TJ. 
[02:33:30]  You don't want the Times to like your movie.  They suck.  They wouldn't fucking print the offensive Islam cartoon because they were afraid of getting  bombed by Muslims.  Fuck them.  Yeah, well, listen, but mostly it's a feature-length gimmick.  Right.  And the issue is, you know, what I love is the New York Times, which purports to be this  amazing, edgy, highbrow critical paper, calls this movie a gimmick.  Well, it's the first movie to do what it does. 
[02:34:00]  And that in itself is exciting.  That's what I like about the film, is that it's the only movie that has tried to do this,  that shoots it like Blair Witch, you know, in this very small scale, and they're spending  tons of money on special effects.  Yeah.  So it's unlike anything that's out there.  But it's a gimmick.  Yeah, but just a gimmick.  You know what I mean?  It's a 3D movie.  Hey, can I ask you something about the movie that we forgot?  It's incense around?  Is it incense around where everything shakes?  You can smell it. 
[02:34:30]  The smell-o-vision.  After the movie, we took off, and then I got a text from Iraq, and he said something  happened after the credits.  So we want people to stick around for the end of the credits.  Stick around for the credits.  And that's a J.J.  Arups thing.  It's like everything that he does is layered, and there's some weird stuff that happens in  the credits.  If you look very closely, the last couple shots, there's something that goes on that  maybe gives some explanation to the origin of the creature.  And I've seen it four times, and I still haven't caught everything.  Each time I see it, I'm kind of noticing different stuff. 
[02:35:00]  And that's J.J.'s style.  I mean, if you watch Lost, if you're a Lost fan, you'll see that in every episode, there's  stuff that alludes to previous episodes and episodes coming out.  That's why a lot of people have said, is there going to be a sequel?  People have talked about whether or not there'll be another movie that's shot from a different  perspective.  That's what I said over there.  Right, exactly.  That was me!  That was you!  But that, you know, that's kind of what he does and what makes it a cool movie to see  twice, because you catch some stuff that you can catch in the first one. 
[02:35:30]  What is whispered after the credits?  It's hard to understand.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not going to, you know, why would he blow it?  I'm not going to spoil it, but I will say it's worth you to stick around for that.  And also, really pay attention to the last scene, because everybody, where does it come  from, what's, the whole, the whole thing of the movie is, there isn't any, a review that  I read that I liked was, we don't cut to the president figuring out where this comes from  and what are the, you know, how do we take this thing down? 
[02:36:00]  That never happens.  So a lot is left unexplained, and I like that, but there, you know, in the end of the movie  there's some, there's some clues to exactly where this thing came from.  And Iraq did catch it, that dummy caught it.  Why is it only 84 minutes?  So I would like it to have been like an hour and 35, I don't know, it's a little short.  I mean, I would love to have seen like another 15 minutes of a movie.  I think it's too intense to go any longer.  It also gives a lot of people motion sickness.  But it's, it's a, it's a crazy movie to, to watch. 
[02:36:30]  And I know, Abe.  And to do two hours of it might be a little bit much.  And that's when, when it came in an hour and a half, Paramount said, this is really short  for a film.  And then they screened it, and they said, we don't want it, we don't want it any longer  than an hour and 35.  We don't.  The stupid times really bugs me.  It's, it's unbelievable.  What, what do they say in the times, Jimmy?  What have you seen?  The guy, the guy who's writing it, his name is Manolo Dargis.  He obviously understands good films.  I mean, they just like a certain type of, of, of genre. 
[02:37:00]  I would love to know what type of film like this he's given a good review to.  That's, that's my thing.  As far as, as far as the genre goes, there's, there's, there's nothing like it.  And I think it's, I think it's great.  It's a great monster movie.  It's a great monster movie.  And they call it a blunt instrument designed to smash and grab without Freudian complexity  or political critique.  It's a monster movie.  What the fuck did they say about Transformers?  It's a, it's, it's a, it's a large scale version of a cartoon. 
[02:37:30]  They're giving you this shit about 9-11 too in there.  You know what?  A lot, a lot of people brought that up.  And, uh, and I think, uh, actually JJ and Matt said in an interview, they said, we, you  know, we're not, this isn't, this isn't a 9-11 movie.  This is a movie about the, what's in the public state of mind right now, which is, uh, that  bad things can happen at any time.  And people don't know how, how or why and how they would.  And they said this movie in a way can be a kind of a catharsis for, for that. 
[02:38:00]  And I, that's, you know, that's a high minded look at, at a monster film.  But I think in some ways it is, it is a movie that talks about the fact that, you know,  everybody's, everybody's concerned with the future and what's going to happen and where's  this kid going and, you know, all this stuff.  And then when shit goes down, who matters, what, what matters that, what, what do you  do and, uh, and how you deal.  And that's what the film is about.  So it's not, it's not a lot of people say, oh, it's an allegory for 9-11 and the monsters 
[02:38:30]  are terrorists.  And, uh, it's Al Qaeda, but it's eating people.  I'm a asshole and all that sort of stuff.  And I, yeah, I don't, to me, that doesn't matter.  It's, it's about, it's about the immediacy of the moment.  I didn't think of 9-11 at all.  Obviously just because there was one shot of lower Manhattan.  But to me, a monster, if you're going to attack a city, there's no more visually interesting  or compact place than New York.  That's why they keep fucking it up in every movie.  I disagree with Jimmy.  Why? 
[02:39:00]  Milwaukee.  Yeah, but Milwaukee, the problem is, is, is, is, is the epicenter of the country.  And people couldn't live through a Milwaukee attack.  Ah, okay, all right.  I mean, what is Milwaukee?  It's beer farts and fucking bad mustaches and incest.  A monster just kicking incest victims and fucking eating them.  There's, uh, but New York is by far the most, uh, visually interesting.  It's the most interesting city.  Fuck, LA's, you know, LA's a big, sprawling suburb, really.  There's not really a fucking city. 
[02:39:30]  The city part of it sucks a dick.  So it had to be New York.  Halfway, halfway through, the monster would, like, lean on his knees and go, yeah, that's  right.  The monster would have to have a car to get anywhere in fucking Los Angeles.  But he's standing on the 10 in traffic looking at his big monster watch.  Yeah.  But I, I agree with you.  I mean, the, the movie sat there largely because it is, JJ was trying to redefine what, uh,  what the Godzilla movies were and, and how we haven't had a movie like this in a long  time.  Sure.  And New York is, you know, it's like Tokyo. 
[02:40:00]  You gotta, you, you gotta, you gotta set the movie where it's appropriate.  Yeah.  And I think Manhattan.  You know what amazed me about the movie too is, uh, when we found out that it was a,  a, a giant, uh, bunny rabbit, I was like, what the fuck?  You couldn't believe it.  It's, yeah.  Like, how, how'd they pull that off?  Eating carrots and dropping little bunny doozies.  There's rabbit, rabbit shit all over.  And just crushing vehicles.  That's why the New York Times was pissed because they had a giant rabbit shitting on.  That's unbelievable.  A giant rabbit.  They don't grow that big.  You find the rabbit is just nibbling on the tops of the buildings because he's hungry. 
[02:40:30]  But toss it.  It's like, ah!  I like to think that there's like a couple listeners that go and see the movie and are  really disappointed that it's not a rabbit.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Opie said.  And the beautiful thing too is this was a monster.  Like Kong was a great movie, but had tremendous, I didn't like Jack Black in it at all.  I thought it was, I thought Adrian Brody was way, it was just way too long of a setup.  But the monster, at least, there was some kind of a connection.  You could have this.  The monster was of, there was no, no conscience.  There was no connection to humanity at all.  Whereas, you know, Kong liked the chick and wasn't out to hurt people. 
[02:41:00]  He just ached.  But this was a fucking wrecking machine.  It was.  And yeah.  And it's great.  It was great too because that's, that's the point of the movie is not kind of, oh,  what, you know, everyone's like, what is it?  What is it?  What attacks?  What, what, what is this thing?  Right.  That's what everybody wants to know.  And you go and see the movie and you realize it doesn't even matter.  It's not, that the monster's great.  I love, I love visually how it came out.  I love everything.  But the movie is about these characters and what they do, you know, in the midst of this 
[02:41:30]  thing.  More importantly.  And it's not a, it's not a fucking gorilla.  Is he going to, more importantly, is Abrams going to drag you onto the Lost franchise?  Uh, he would have to drag, I think.  I'm not, no, I'm not.  He, you know, a couple of people went out for a pile of the, and you know, he's doing  Star Trek.  And I went on Star Trek, uh, and I, everybody on, on the Star Trek set was like, hey, you  got to meet Chris Pine.  He's, you know, he plays Captain.  He's hilarious.  He's so funny.  He's your, you know, because a lot of them worked on Clover. 
[02:42:00]  Oh my God, you got to meet this guy.  He's hysterical.  He's so funny.  So I walk over to him.  He's next to Zach Kinto, who's in, uh, Heroes and, and actually plays Dr. Spock in, in the  movie.  And I go up to him and I go, hey, what's up?  I heard you're hilarious.  Everybody keeps saying about how funny you are.  I'm, I'm TJ.  I'm the star of Cloverfield.  I'm the main, I'm the main part of Cloverfield.  I'm really, really, I'm the big, I'm the star of that film.  And he goes, oh, hey, what's up?  And then he gets back to me a week later.  He's going to go, this fucking jackass came up to me and said he was the star. 
[02:42:30]  Who does he think he is?  Doesn't he know I'm Captain Kirk?  It's like, yeah, he, he's really got a sense of you.  Yeah, he's a hilarious guy.  But the, you know, JJ, it's crazy that he, that's, what's great is he's doing Star Trek,  which is $150 million movie.  It's going to be this huge film, but it's, it's, uh, it's completely different.  Cloverfield is a completely different thing.  And it's basically an indie effort for him.  And, uh, so, but I, I was not asked to, uh, to audition for Star Trek. 
[02:43:00]  And can I, can I say, uh, oh fuck, I had a point and I forgot it, man.  Oh, Jimmy.  Guys, you know, it was something on, uh, oh, anytime people tell you, you gotta meet so-and-so,  he's hilarious.  He's never hilarious.  Never hilarious.  Right, exactly.  It's always a bucket of fucking dead infants.  Wow, what a fucking hoot.  Yeah, exactly.  A bucket of shit.  That'll be good.  You, uh, you watch Lost?  Like, you've done the whole thing.  I didn't, I didn't, yeah, I, I, I, I started watching it after, after, after I got in the 
[02:43:30]  film.  But I, I wasn't, I'm not, you know, I'm not into the, I'm not, uh, on the internet figuring  out what the next episode's going to be.  But once I saw a couple episodes, it is, it's a good movie.  I'm a huge, for me, it's always been Felicity.  Wow.  That's my big.  When she cut her hair, it fucked it up for me.  I stopped watching.  Yeah, I really did.  Her locks.  How about The Wire?  Do you watch The Wire?  I have, I have seen a little bit.  It's great.  It's fucking unbelievable.  It's fucking, HBO On Demand, here's what happens, you go On Demand, and you click series, and 
[02:44:00]  they have Entourage, but I can't, you have to go with the down, the down arrows, or the  right, left, which take you from, like, you know, series to this, to that.  I'm stuck in Entourage, because the fucking right, left buttons are not working.  It's not my clicker, it's the actual On Demand.  Clicker?  Listen to me, you sound like a fucking 60-year-old man.  The clicker.  He likes his programs.  The clicker.  I go home, I watch my programs.  I have to see my stories.  Yeah, the fucking remote, it's something on the On Demand, so I can't get to The Wire, 
[02:44:30]  because it's only on Entourage, it will go up and down, but when I get to the base,  I can't go right or left to switch shows.  You can't go to the cable box and do the manual thing on the little cable box?  Do you have little arrows on there?  Oh, I didn't think of that.  Shit in the hat.  Fucking goddamned the thought of the maker.  Should be murdered.  We should take a break.  TJ, are you going to hang or what?  We can talk about all the shit.  What do you have today?  I would love to.  We've got, we've got, look, I've got a lot of stuff to do with Extra and all this.  No, I can, yeah, I would love, I'll hang for another thing, and then I've got to go over it. 
[02:45:00]  He's a stand-up comedian.  Yeah, I know, I know.  We did a gig together.  Comes from Chicago.  We did do a gig.  I could barely fucking follow him.  I had to go up after, and I invited all my friends.  All the cast was there of Cloverfield.  Did you know this, Joey?  No.  That he was in the movie?  No, I had no idea.  I go, I go, I go, I go, you guys got to come see me.  I'm doing this great, this great, this great show.  They all come out, and then I find out he was going to close the show,  and I think you had to make a spot at the cellar.  So he said, he's like, you mind if I go up right before you?  And in my mind, I'm like, fuck, yes, I mind. 
[02:45:30]  Absolutely.  Jimmy, man, you fucker.  No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.  So they all come to see me, you know, and see my set,  and then Jim Norton just destroys up front and then takes off.  Oh, of course, yeah.  I remember, I think actually one of the girls, I forget which one,  maybe it was Jessica, the single one afterwards said something like,  yeah, yeah, you were funny, you were funny.  Love that guy before you.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow, Jimmy.  Oh, the Canadian girl.  Yeah, I don't remember, I don't remember which one it was. 
[02:46:00]  Shit, I hope it's her.  Yeah.  Come on, single Canadian.  Jimmy's already prepared his apartment just in case.  Absolutely.  It's not a...  You got maple syrup everywhere, and fucking Canadian flags.  It's not even a sign that he had a girlfriend.  It's all in boxes in the hallway.  Yeah, my spare bathroom just has fucking clothes piled up in it,  and tampons, and whatever else.  Girlfriend leaves over the place.  Behind the shower curtain, it's all her stuff.  Fucking Valtrex that we share.  All right, more with TJ from, of course, Cloverfield after the break, 
[02:46:30]  but we'll try to talk about other shit.  Maybe Britney Spears, I don't know.  Whatever you want.  Whatever pops up.  Whatever pops up, that's what we'll do, yeah.  Today, we're going to talk to a man who says to have a deadly weapon to defend yourself.  I am an armed citizen.  How about that?  Is this really paranoia?  I don't want to be robbed.  I don't want anyone in my goddamn house.  You're being attacked.  Your life is on the line.  What do you do?  Pile the bodies up at the door.  Do you have a knife?  Do you have all that stuff around? 
[02:47:00]  What are you, crazy?  Why would I want to get into a knife fight with somebody?  How else are you supposed to stop somebody?  Get in their tracks.  I will have the AK and the AR, one in each hand.  Being overtaken.  Rally point.  Rally point.  Anyone coming in the bedroom door is completely exposed to my fire.  Zips in the wire.  I will fight it out till the end, till somebody's dead. 
[02:47:30]  Rally point.  Getting all sorts of inside info on Gloverfield.  Let's just say there's a scene with rats.  Yeah.  And we just found out that they were real.  Wow.  You'd think they were CGI or like fucking...  Where do you get rats? 
[02:48:00]  I don't know  I imagine they have them  for movies  where they're not just  filthy fucking  mite ridden sewer rats  I mean they probably  they probably just like  dangle a piece of cheese  and go here ratty rat  and then they all  just come out of hiding  and then you  gather them up  for a scene in a movie  or all the ones  that can't get work  after they were in Willard  it was all  it was all out of work  rats  all from Willard  they fucked up Willard  Crispin Glover  actually went out  for the part  of one of the rats  and he didn't get it  he was good in that 
[02:48:30]  movie but the rats  were so not believable  in that fucking movie  no I mean it looks  CGI'd and all that  crap is what I'm getting at  yeah no but it really  it was  it was real  and they had  they like trained them  and I remember  the funny thing was  the way that the movie's  shot  there's no coverage  so they really  have to prepare  for each take  right  and they got these rats  and the rats  they only have memories  that last like  ten minutes  or something  wow I wish chicks 
[02:49:00]  were like that  who just fucked my ass  and threw me out of the car  15 minutes later  you're like  you wanna  yeah sure  whatever  back in the car  sitting gingerly  Canadian hookers  are like that  I've heard  15 minute memories  yeah but these  you know  so they would keep  forgetting what they  were supposed to do  which was just run  in one direction  right  and so that  that day was a real  pain in my ass  that was a long  long day  I wonder if that's why  they eat garbage and shit 
[02:49:30]  because they forget  how it tastes  this is disgusting  I'll never eat this shit  again  15 minutes later  that looks delicious  what is that  feces  yes I will  so what would they run  in the wrong direction  or something like that  yeah they'd run  they'd run all  you know  they'd run a circular  pattern and go all  over the place  and it's funny  it's funny  you know  you always  you think about  and you want to be  on a movie set  one day  this is all your life  you're like  I want to  and then you hear  yourself being like  god would they get  the fucking rats  together 
[02:50:00]  what have I become  you know  they're all pompous  yeah it's ridiculous  it's in the subway  which is a creepy place  to have rats  and they're on train tracks  and it's just like  ugh  like fucking  a lot of rats man  yeah  hey there was something  we were going to talk about  on the other side  the crash landing  you said how horrific  and horrifying that was  and we couldn't get to it  because we were going  to break you  British Airways  in Heathrow  from I think it was  Singapore or somewhere  I think it was an Asian country  and they were landing  in Heathrow  and the fucking plane  it was a 777 too 
[02:50:30]  it was an impeccable  that's pretty new  and a pretty big one right  the biggest right now  I know  pretty new plane  to be wrapping up like that  they were fucking landing  and I think the plane  lost all power  which is fucking horrifying  and they just  fucking smashed down  on the runway  luckily they were there  and something tells me  it was pilot error  he probably cut the engines  and it was fucked up  and the fucking  the wheels went up  through the fucking wings  oh my god 
[02:51:00]  no one died though  it was only 19 injuries  because they were all  buckled in  but that's horrifying  yeah before the whole runway  and they finally stopped  right on the apron  of the runway  where it starts  so it's like  hey we made it  to the runway  oh they didn't hit  the runway  no they just made it  to the runway  like he hit  way before the runway  and they were just  skidding on dirt  I love  I do love that you said  no one was hurt  because they were  buckled in  and I do  when people tell you 
[02:51:30]  there's turbulence  put your  and you're like  I'm not fucking  putting my seatbelts on  if we crash  no one's gonna care about  a seatbelt being on  but yeah I guess  if that's  a situation like that  they said a lot of times  people smash their heads  on the roof  on some of that shit  yeah  oh they go  yeah  oh that makes sense  some people said  they thought it was  just a hard landing  at first  and then the wings  flying past the window  yeah perhaps  that tipped you off  the landing gear  those passengers 
[02:52:00]  have a very low  low bar of expectation  yeah  a little bit  of a rough landing  oh there's a wheel  five inches from my head  that's smashed to the window  there'll always be somebody  that they talk to  that'll say that shit though  the guy said  he goes until the doors opened  and the slides came out  he goes he had just thought  it was a rough landing  you look at the plane  the engines  you can only see half of them  because the rest were  dug into the ground  oh my god  yeah  they were dug into the ground 
[02:52:30]  and the wing  where it meets the fuselage  was just twisted metal  and this guy's like  ready to go to the baggage carousel  hey  I have a transfer here  come on  I have to catch another flight  oh my god  yeah  I'm now looking at the picture  Jesus  that plane is  fucked up  that's uh  yeah  pretty new  plane too  those 777s are  oh I feel very safe  on them  I think that's the first one  767s  um but  ugh  you ready for your  we just dropped

[03:22:30]  make you take your  clothes off and put  on the sweatsuits  no but he probably  had a little camera  hooked up yeah  jerked off  remember he was  talking about how  black cocks don't  get as hard as  white cocks in  porno  take a little off  the top  yeah that's that  casual barber  conversation  all right  uh the mad  scientist  and epstein  epstein  and epstein  do we have the  first episode of  mad the mad  scientist  and epstein 
[03:23:00]  this is gonna lead  to something a  brand new piece  of production  from uh who  did this one  fan and travis  yes steve was uh  you know saying  we don't provide  enough original  all right so we  uh we got an  anti mad scientist  and epstein  production piece  but first the  original here's the  mad scientist and  epstein just in case  you've never heard  this  epstein  epstein  look and see what  i've concocted  this conveniently  sized apparatus  will transform  any ordinary 
[03:23:30]  tap water  into a combustible  fuel  to be used in  automobiles  it will  revolutionize  energy consumption  as we know  it  please handle  it gently  it's the only  one of its  kind  quite impressive  it's most  compact  perhaps it  would fit  in my  tiny  no  epstein  no  no 
[03:24:00]  epstein  no  it's pointy  it's just  one of a  oh don't  pull  grease  all over  it  it's going  in  epstein  it's almost  there  it's in  mine  tiny  right  back to the  drawing board  then  it's in  mine  tiny  mine  tiny  mine  tiny 
[03:24:30]  and that's  the reaction  we were  expecting to  get by the  way from  the bleacher  turn the  mics on  out there  oh were  they laughing  were they  dumbfounded  sam needs  to know  they liked  it  yeah  you can  literally hear  them saying  hubbub  hubbub  well there  was a second  episode  yeah it was  even better  okay here's  the second  episode of  the mad  scientist  and  epstein  epstein  stop playing 
[03:25:00]  with your  testicles  and look  what i've  done  this  conveniently  shaped  vial  contains  an elixir  which will  increase  the metabolism  of anyone  who drinks  it  can you  imagine  this could  eliminate  the worldwide  obesity epidemic  permanently  no  let me  see  no  well  i suppose  if you're  careful  there's  just the  one  and  say  this would 
[03:25:30]  fit perfectly  in  mine  hiney  no  no  no  it's  in  it's  in  mine  hiney  well  at least  it's  still  intact  now  give it  back  here  you  go  no  my  elixir  it's 
[03:26:00]  all  over  the  ceiling  epstein  you  you  well  back to  the drawing  board  i suppose  blue  heeler  says it  all  from  kentucky  he writes  yeah  can we  hear the  razor  sounds  again  please  so  where are we  at  with this  horseshit 
[03:26:30]  well  episode  three  is in  the works  i thought  we were  turning you  around  with the  second  one  well  the second  one was  an overall  hit  overall  hit  it's being  called  yes  the third  one  is in  production  right now  it's in  the writing  stages  we have  some big  ideas  to move  both  characters  in  and that  is something  that we  will  sort of  heterorero  great  heterosexual 
[03:27:00]  well i mean  epstein's  sexuality is  still in  question  of course  it is  so many  unanswered  questions  right  the inventor  is an  obvious  heterosexual  yeah okay  epstein on  the other  hand  yeah i  don't know  i don't know  that mine  hiney thing  is his  catchphrase  though  yeah  you gotta  have a  catchphrase  catchphrase  like the  first time  he says  it  in the  bit  people  applaud  applaud  sure  yeah  well we  got an  audio  reply  it's being  called  right  yes  travis  thought  that  there's  a million 
[03:27:30]  directions  you can  go with  this  inventor  that  comes  up  with  life  changing  devices  we  decided  to explore  a different  one  oh okay  and that's  all this  needs  yeah pretty  much  okay here  we go  is it named  anything  uh the  adventures of  dr what were  their names  dr thomas and  dr hoffman  hoffman yeah  dr thomas i  have made a  most interesting  discovery 
[03:28:00]  do tell  dr hoffman  i have  unlocked the  secrets to  the human  immune system  fascinating  what have  you found  this vial  contains the  cure for  cancer  may i  see it  here you  go  i have a  whole vat  of the  stuff  it's so  smooth  and  compact  it's just  a standard  test tube  i was  thinking  that i  could  what  file a  patent  with the 
[03:28:30]  food and  drug  administration  oh yeah  thanks i  hate paperwork  no problem  uh cool  so back  to the  drawing board  wow  that one  took a  weird  turn  it really  did  we were all  waiting for  it  you never  know what  those crazy  scientists are  gonna do  that was  strange  wow  what do you  have to say  about that  i thought 
[03:29:00]  first of all  i didn't get  it  i didn't get  it  i saw one  character  and then i  really didn't  understand dr  thomas he  just sounded  like than to  me  i didn't  understand that  yeah that's the  other thing is we  explored maybe not  doing a ridiculous  voice for every  character  there's all kinds  of possibilities  that's the beauty  of radio  yeah i didn't hear  one ridiculous  voice in that  promo  no we just did  one we saw  what would be  like  well now i'm  thinking maybe  you guys have  to like respond  to what you  just heard  i kind of 
[03:29:30]  you know  something  i kind of  liked that  but it  doesn't  but  let me tell you  something also  before you  say anything  the acting i  think was more  believable  than in the  uh  your guys  whatever the  fuck they're  called  that would be  the inventor  in epstein  all right  the inventor  in epstein  see the acting  was a little  more believable  in this one  uh and uh  i think that  that the way  than delivered  his lines  were was  the way it 
[03:30:00]  should have  been done  in his voice  like that  because it's  just kind  of oh  okay  we're doing  this and  it's business  as usual  see dr thomas  is not uh  very old  or british  or in a  wheelchair  so that's  why he didn't  sound like  why does there  have to be so  many things  going on with  these characters  because these are  characters  they're fleshed out  and they're  interesting  they have a lot  of depth  these are things  yes  a lot of depth  it's something people  i want to know  more  you don't get  all the answers  right away  it's like a  jj abrams  type of thing 
[03:30:30]  oh wow  you don't get  everything right  away  i say we turn  this into a  soap opera  yeah  now it's uh  your turn to  come up with  something that  is based on  what uh  they just did  well that would  be easy  we could do  that  all right  that's what  i say you'd  do  and then you  know and  then you  know it'll  be their turn  bat it back  and forth  for a while  what you do  as you respond  to what they  did  so i think  it was more  realistic  yeah  but people  turn on i  think  i think  people turn  on uh  xm202 the  virus to  escape to  a world of 
[03:31:00]  fantasy  where they  can sort  of  or to  take a  nap  actually  most of  the people  that are  employed here  are escaped  to a world  of fantasy  especially ones  that think  wacky character  voices make  a bit  i feel like  they want to  leave uh  the hard  cold realities  behind  and i think  epstein and  the inventor  really helped  that  thought it was  the inventor  and epstein  no i'm saying  those two  characters  i thought it  was the  mad scientist  no he's  just an  inventor  he's not  crazy  he's just 
[03:31:30]  sweet old  and in a  wheelchair  he's kind  of crazy  because he  sits there  and allows  his partner  there to  bang shit  up his ass  he can't  stand up  he's in a  wheelchair  all right  very good  we're going  to take a  break  we're going  to come  back  do a little  more radio  just a little  bit  Travis's dog  is here  i'm very  happy  we're going  to meet  Travis's dog  we've got  one sheet  little dexter  is our guest  we're going to meet  little dexter  and then we're  going to do  line of the  day  i saw a picture  of dexter

[03:33:00]  i grew up  when i was  uh when i was  growing up in  california  it was country  music was like  all my father  would listen to  so i got  like a dose  of that but  that's like  what i think  they call  classic country  now there's  different genres  of it it's  called shit  it well yeah  but it was  like um  like a freddie  fender and  uh and  uh i don't  know i don't  even remember  the names but  it's all that  old country  stuff right  so depending  on if they  do that i 
[03:33:30]  would know  some of the  songs but  the other  shit is just  like new  country i  couldn't tell  you it  doesn't even  fucking matter  if we if  you oh  no i know i'm  not saying it  would fit us  at all anyway  right either  way i'm just  saying like i'd  at least be  familiar with  some of the  music right  we're i know  nothing about  country we're  definitely a bit  distracted and  the uh the  haircut definitely  helped us out  today because uh  we're trying to  figure out what  the fuck's going  on at uh at  k-rock yep and  tim just ran over  um a piece of  the production  that's what he 
[03:34:00]  should have done  with his  fucking car  uh but we  were just  handed this uh  by tim who  uh works for  k-rock yeah  which is uh  turning into  into a country  station uh  sometime next  week we're  supposedly going  to know more  after our  monday show  yeah and  we're supposed  to still be  there as the  morning show  but it's kind  of a weird  mixture that  doesn't really  fit we fit in 
[03:34:30]  a lot of  different formats  of music i  mean you could  put us in  mornings on a  classic rock  station or a  alternative station  uh you know  but country is  one of those  that eh i  don't i don't  know i'm not  feeling too good  about that one  we're gonna have  the coal miners  daughter giveaway  what the fuck  yeah i know  what are we  gonna like give  away like the  listeners to the  station aren't  gonna well we're  not giving away  anything now anyway  so like it would  matter well this  is what was  10 gallon hat  yeah big ass
