<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show begins with the hosts and Jim Norton engaging in extremely vulgar and sexually explicit conversation.  A significant portion of the early show is dedicated to "Cereal Gate," a mystery surrounding missing boxes of Apple Jacks and Cinnamon Toast Crunch from the studio.  E-Rock discovers the partially eaten cereal near the trash, leading to accusations against the staff of the Ron and Fez show, particularly Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley (one person) and Pips (Nick).  Suspicion falls on Pips after a Twitter report mentions Ron observing him eating cereal the previous day.  A bag of books and DVDs belonging to the Ron and Fez show, including a self-help book signed by His Holiness the Gilwang Drukpa (a guest from the previous Ron and Fez show), is found near the cereal, further fueling the mystery, which remains unsolved. The conversation then shifts to a documentary about Morton Downey Jr. and a video of a baboon grabbing a reporter's breast during a live news segment.  Further speculation on Cereal Gate concludes this initial section.

The next segment begins with a discussion about an NFL player's obscene gesture and the league's hypocrisy regarding player celebrations versus concussions and finances.  This transitions into a discussion of O.J. Simpson stealing cookies from prison, leading to a lengthy tangent about the hosts' food preferences, focusing on nuts and peanut butter, with one host sharing a story about overcoming a peanut butter aversion due to hunger.  The conversation then turns to the Navy Yard shooting and the apparent lack of security monitoring surveillance footage.  The hosts critique Piers Morgan's interview with two boys suspended for playing with toy guns, criticizing the school's zero-tolerance policy.  Cory Booker's online interactions with a stripper are discussed, alongside other tabloid stories like a woman's plastic surgery to resemble Lindsey Lohan.  The upcoming "Joctober" segment, possibly featuring Scott Shannon, is mentioned.  A discussion about lottery winners' struggles, specifically Willie Seeley's experience, follows. A caller suggests having a tattooed stripper on the show, leading to a discussion about tattoos and a call for Bonnie Rotten. One host displays an erection, while another describes a masturbation session after his parents' visit.  The segment ends with discussions about rock stars' children versus athletes' children, a resignation to be read on air, a comedian's altercation with a Twitter user, and some music discussion.

The following segment opens with speculation about the age and conception of Melissa Etheridge and David Crosby's child.  This leads to a discussion about paparazzi and their pursuit of celebrity children. The majority of the segment focuses on a comedic bit inspired by Dickie Goodman’s novelty records, specifically a "Jaws" themed record. Guest Denny Falcone participates in creating a modern hip-hop parody, discussing its potential for broadcast.  The discussion includes reminiscing about other novelty records (Mr. Jaws, Club Soda Kenny), streaking, Ray Stevens' music, Tim Conway's Dwarf on Golf commercials, Denny Falcone's podcast, and an anecdote about Denny's workplace seating arrangement.  Ventriloquist Auto (described as R-rated) joins as a guest, sharing stories about a gasoline injury, his upcoming gigs, his opinions on *Breaking Bad*, his illness and recovery, his views on hospitals, and his experience performing in a strip club.  The conversation concludes with further discussion of Abbott and Costello.

A segment focusing on the Three Stooges, the 2012 film adaptation, and the acting styles of classic Hollywood actors follows. The hosts discuss the life and death of Curly Howard, comparing it to Fred Mertz’s, and express their dislike for *Miracle on 34th Street*.  They discuss the acting styles of Marlon Brando, John Garfield, and Richard Widmark, attributing some early film acting styles to technological limitations.  Studio guest Michael Shannon is mentioned, with the hosts recounting a meeting and showing a photo. The conversation moves to Richard Kuklinski and Roy DeMeo, with the hosts sharing anecdotes about their crimes.  The hosts then analyze Lou Costello’s later film, *The 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock*, highlighting its poor special effects.  The discussion covers 1950s and 60s sci-fi/horror films, including *The Blob* and Vincent Price movies.  Guest Otto details his recent hospitalization for spinal meningitis, describing his illness, dreams, recovery, and family support. The segment concludes with promoting Otto's upcoming comedy shows and discussing *Breaking Bad*, including predictions for the finale and the impact of spoilers.

The final segment focuses on a discussion of television shows: *Breaking Bad*, *Dexter*, and *Sons of Anarchy*.  The hosts and caller Max from Dallas compare the shows, discussing storytelling and character development. Max, a former student of Peter Weller, shares an anecdote about Weller's on-screen and off-screen personalities.  The conversation includes significant discussion of the graphic content and profanity in *Sons of Anarchy* and *Breaking Bad*, comparing the cursing and network approaches (Showtime and FX).  The hosts promote Otto's upcoming comedy shows in New Jersey, concluding the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Here are the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:03:30]  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  So vulgar.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second. 
[00:04:00]  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:04:30]  Rules are destroyed, and conventions burn to the grove.  Would you like to make the fuck be dead again?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I wouldn't eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  Well, he doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fare you wanted?  Tie these people.  Up my ass all the time, trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off. 
[00:05:00]  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  We got an issue.  There's always an issue. 
[00:05:30]  We have an issue.  Of sorts.  Yes.  Good morning, everyone.  Of some sorts.  Hi, everybody.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Starring little Jimmy Norton.  Welcome.  Welcome, everybody.  Oh, look at all the smiling faces.  We got a serial gate.  Serial gate.  Now, serious.  Serial gate is about to begin.  Yes.  If you thought yesterday's inane rambling wreck of E-Rock and Sal being late for the first  hour of conversation was good. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, boy.  I'm a big fan of the inane babble that we do.  I love the inane.  I understand some of you don't.  I read your tweets.  Go fuck yourself.  But I really enjoy it.  Who doesn't?  Come on.  I love being nitpicky.  Right.  What about Sal and E-Rock?  They get here nice and early today because people need to know.  They want to know.  They were absolutely here early today.  That was like the same time they walk in together.  No. 
[00:06:30]  Sal was here a little bit before E-Rock, but both gentlemen were here at 515 this morning.  515.  Proving our point to Sal that if you had to be here, you would be here.  Yes.  Okay.  Wouldn't Sal have been smart to come in late again and when confronted go,  see, I told you there's no way to get here on time with the trains the way they are.  Instead, he found a way.  Now it looks like he really just fucking cheesed off yesterday because he could have been here. 
[00:07:00]  Did you ask him how he got here?  No.  I didn't interact with him.  Subway's happy to be running for him this morning.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but.  Well, whatever.  I'm very happy that you're here early, Sal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's wonderful.  That's a very good first step.  Here he comes.  Look, he's even running down the hall.  My God, is this the new Sal?  Oh, no.  Is this the new Sal?  It should be a better show today.  I don't like him.  Well, why would he come in the studio?  He ran by the studio.  He just ran by the studio because I guess he's not listening to the show. 
[00:07:30]  No, he isn't.  He didn't know it started.  Now he's coming in the studio.  He ran by the studio.  Now he's coming in the studio.  Hey, Sal.  How did you get here by 515?  I paid for a cap.  For where?  Like from where to where?  From Brooklyn to here.  How much did it cost you?  All the way?  Yeah.  It was like 30, a little bit over 30 after a change, after a tip and all that sort of bullshit.  Why didn't you?  I was considering doing what you said about coming in late again, just for the goof of  it, but no, I was like.  For the goof of it, yeah.  That would have been like, prove your point. 
[00:08:00]  There's no way.  Can't do it.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have Tim Sabian pay for your cap.  No, it's okay.  I'm not going to worry about it.  It's all right.  What's the matter?  This is like a different guy from yesterday.  He's got it.  I got it.  I'm on it.  I'm on the motherfucker.  Like you said, investment in myself.  Oh.  That's right.  Yes.  It's an investment in yourself.  Very good.  Short that investment.  So you got in at 5.15 and then what did you do?  Well, it's like I can get to my normal routine of things as opposed to like rushing yesterday 
[00:08:30]  when I was like printing shit last second and all that sort of stuff.  So yeah.  So happy to be back early.  Happy to be here.  Happy to be back coming in early.  It's happy to be back coming in on time.  When I come here late, I swear to God, I'm like sweating.  I'm stressing it like out so hard like by the time I get here and getting in early is  just a beautiful thing.  It really is.  It's not getting in early. 
[00:09:00]  I'm not going to accept that.  No, no.  You're right.  It's getting in on time.  You're right.  5.15.  I mean, you know.  On time.  Barely.  You know.  I mean.  It should be five.  But an hour would be good.  You know.  A nice round number.  An hour.  One hour.  One hour before the show almost starts.  Yeah, it's not 0.75 of an hour.  Because now these assholes are pointing fingers at us.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, what time do you start the show?  Oh, look who's talking. 
[00:09:30]  Why don't you look in a mirror?  AIDS!  Fucking idiots.  Just idiots.  Oh, Jesus.  But never acknowledge when we go late, right?  Go fuck yourselves.  Thank you, Sal.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You're not the problem today.  Oh, wow.  The cereal is the problem.  The cereal.  Yes.  The cereal gate is about to go down.  If you recall yesterday, we were talking a little bit about cereal. 
[00:10:00]  I'm not sure how we got into it.  What do you mean you're not sure?  It's been my obsession for the last, since the summer.  Yes, your Lucky Charms taunts you.  My Lucky Charms obsession.  And guess what?  Brand new box sitting in my house.  I didn't buy it.  Oh, shit.  The other box was down to nothing, like you said, where everything was starting to get  stale, so I know I could say no to that.  And then I walk in the house yesterday, there's a fresh box waiting to be open. 
[00:10:30]  She tasks me?  Yes.  Well, it's from my kid.  Yeah.  She's not going to stop getting it, because I can't fucking keep my hands off it.  Does your kid like Cheerios, like the commercial, or does he prefer Lucky Charms?  No, of course not.  No kid likes plain Cheerios.  It's like we're having breakfast with Nana.  Ugh, really?  I don't hear the annoying voice and the, again, inane conversation.  Clacking of false teeth.  You can almost get away with multi-grain Cheerios with the kids, but not the regular Cheerios. 
[00:11:00]  Cheerios.  Honey Nuts.  Honey Nuts good, too.  Absolutely.  That's what Jimmy calls me.  So, again, I got a new box of Lucky Charms.  Yeah.  That I did not open yesterday.  Good for you.  Well, you knew you had cereal to look forward to this morning.  Yes.  No.  Yes, because yesterday we were talking about different types of cereal, and Apple Jacks  came up, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch came up, and we're like, oh, cereal day, come on, we'll  all get together and enjoy a nice bowl of cereal together, it'd be great.  Right. 
[00:11:30]  So we got the cereal, but we were so guest-heavy yesterday.  Boy, were we.  A lot of guest-esses that we had a blow-off cereal day.  But that didn't mean that we didn't get the cereal and prepare, and we're ready to rock.  And as Jimmy has pointed out on numerous occasions, the listeners love when we have  a food product, and we call it That Food Product Day.  Do they love what we eat?  They love it.  They're happy for us.  Ah, the guys are getting some good food.  What bit are they doing?  I don't know.  The meatball guy, the guy with the spigoli, I don't know. 
[00:12:00]  I could, I swear to you, I pulled up to work, I couldn't get out of my car.  Yeah.  I was listening to one spoonful after another.  The sad part is we tease it, even.  Like it's a big event.  It's such a big event that we even got to tease it.  We don't just go and start eating the meatballs.  We tease it for a while.  Why wouldn't we?  Got to tease it.  Yeah.  So with that, we had a fresh box of apples.  Notice I just said we had.  Yeah.  And this is where Cereal Gate is going to get ugly.  Cereal Gate.  We had a fresh box of Apple Jacks and a fresh box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. 
[00:12:30]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  And we came in this morning, and I guess we have to go to E-Rock at this point.  Because she was the one that made the discovery.  Well, now that's also a little controversy right there.  Wow.  Him making the discovery, some food's missing.  That's like the fox finding the hen's gone.  Yeah.  And then he blames it on someone else.  I do like that he was spending his newfound first hour at the show investigating.  His newfound hour. 
[00:13:00]  What a cunt Sam is.  His newfound hour.  His newfound.  Funny.  Yes, yes, yes.  You know, 45 minutes.  E-Rock, could you tell us what you found?  Well, the boxes of cereal that we didn't get to yesterday I had stored in a place here in my studio.  Okay.  So it was there.  Was it in a – was it just out in the open on a chair on the console?  Where was it?  No, it was on a console over here behind monitors.  So unless you look down, you really can't see it.  All right.  Okay. 
[00:13:30]  And when I had put it there, I had told people from, you know, the show that –  We're not going to say people.  We're not going to say names today.  Who would you say?  I want fucking names.  Yeah, enough for the show after.  We know a show that's on after us.  No vagary.  Did you really just say that?  Relax.  I was just trying to add to it.  Oh, boy.  What, are you afraid of a lawsuit?  They're on a show.  They'll acknowledge.  Shit, Jimmy, you got balls.  Watch pretend they're walking and firing me immediately.  So I had told their producer, Pips, who takes over this room here after me. 
[00:14:00]  Who the hell is Pips?  He's just a guy they don't talk to on air.  He's just here.  So Pips –  Is he another one of these food pigs?  No, no, no, no.  He works with Gladys Knight.  Yes, of course.  Home run, Jimmy.  Is he one of these food pigs that can't help themselves?  No.  He's just this really skinny, lanky dude.  And I said, these are Opie and Anthony's.  We didn't get to this today.  So I'm going to store them back over here.  Please make sure nobody touches this. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  He said, yes, no problem.  So this morning, I come into this studio to set up, and I see the boxes of cereal on the floor  by the garbage can over here with the Cinnamon Toast Crunch open and a bag of books and DVDs.  A bag of books and DVDs.  What?  Yeah.  Next to the cereal.  Laying next to the cereal.  You mean, you think the owner of the bag of DVDs and books left?  I believe so, yes.  Okay.  So you think that they put down their bag of books and DVDs and got those arms at Busy? 
[00:15:00]  Yes.  Okay.  And there's a lot missing.  Yeah.  Like, almost half the box is gone.  Wow.  That's our shit.  And it doesn't even look the way the inside looks.  It doesn't even look like it was poured.  It's like someone just kept shoving their hands into it.  Shove their hand into it because the top is ripped.  What fucking pig would do that?  Especially because the box wasn't even open.  It was sealed.  It's a sealed box.  So what fucking pig?  Look how it's open, though.  It's open where the one side got ripped open. 
[00:15:30]  They couldn't fucking handle themselves.  You sure it's not a maintenance person?  Like, it's not someone who comes in and cleans up after?  Do we have that or no?  Why would someone do that?  But they might come in late at night.  I think it's somebody that feels comfortable.  Well, the garbage can was empty, so the cleaning crew obviously was in here and cleaned it up.  But the cereal laying there next to the garbage can would have been taken and thrown out.  Oh!  Yeah, good one.  They opened and made it.  Yeah, but a maintenance person would throw out the box, not leave evidence. 
[00:16:00]  Especially if they ate half the box.  You're a regular Kajumbo.  Working on that, were you?  Go ahead, Koyak.  I would think that a maintenance guy would be worried about the ramifications, too.  Well, unless it was a new guy or some temper. 
[00:16:30]  I'm not saying, but you never know before we, you know.  Well, we got another slob among us.  Mars coming?  Oh, what the fuck?  Mars, what do you got?  What does Mars have?  What's up, Mars?  I just want to clear something up about the cereal box.  I actually found them behind the Pro Tools screen like that.  Open.  And the reason I put them by the garbage is because I get pissed off.  They leave these fucking studios a mess.  Uh-huh.  Who's today?  Every morning.  Who's today?  What's the name? 
[00:17:00]  Whoever uses it at evening.  What names today?  What, this vague show that comes on after us?  What is it?  Mystery.  Is it the Ron and Fez show or is it a show at night?  Like, is it just that?  I don't know what happens here in the evening.  I really don't.  Well, supposedly nothing's supposed to happen in the evenings here.  It's not being used in the evenings.  I think Chris stays here late.  Who?  Who?  Stanley.  Who's he?  It's Pepper from Ron and Fez.  What is a Pepper?  Pepper Hicks.  He's their in-studio producer.  Is he Chris Stanley or is he Pepper Hicks? 
[00:17:30]  Chris Stanley, a.k.a. Pepper Hicks.  Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley.  Is he the guy that Ron does the show with?  Yes.  Yes.  I know that guy, but I never really knew his name.  I thought they were two different people.  No, it's Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley.  Oh, see, I'd be like, oh, Pepper Hicks is in today.  And then Chris Stanley is in another day.  No.  Oh, now that makes a little more sense.  Yeah, yeah, no.  All right.  So, I mean, Travis was telling me they leave the studio a mess every fucking day.  And now someone's going after our cereal. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, I see.  So you're saying after the show is over, you think Chris Stanley is here doing other shit.  Oh, he's definitely here working.  I don't know if he's part of the cereal bullshit, but I know he's.  It is cereal bullshit, right?  Oh, man.  This is some bullshit going down.  Stealing people's cereal.  You put it behind the console and put it behind the computer screen?  Yes.  Is that where you left it, E-Rock?  Yeah.  And E-Rock said.  I tucked it behind the monitor.  Oh, so you left it there.  I left it there.  And then they opened it and snuck it back.  Did you tell Pepper Stanley Pip guy? 
[00:18:30]  No, that's two different people.  What?  I thought it was one guy.  I told Pips, not Pepper.  Wait, Pip isn't Pepper?  What?  There's two people on the Ryan and Fez staff.  Who's the Stanley guy?  Is he the Pip or the Pepper guy?  There is Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley.  Right.  And then there's Pip.  Then there's Pips.  So Pips is?  The second guy.  What's his real name?  I think Nick.  So that's the Fez guy.  Nick, a.k.a.  Pips.  I thought Nick was Fez.  No, Fez, you wouldn't. 
[00:19:00]  Only, you have to listen a while before you hear Fez.  Who got Nick?  It's like a fucking, like the mafia.  Yeah, everybody's got a little Nick.  Yeah, yeah.  Nicky two times.  I don't get it.  I don't get it myself.  So now, who?  So wait, Ron and Fez, but Pepper is the Fez guy.  No, Fez Watley is his own man.  But if the show's called Ron and Fez, and a guy named Pepper's talking, so that's Fez's real name.  No, Fez Watley is in the room, but generally speaking, when you turn on the show, you'll hear Ron talking to Chris Pepper Hicks, Stanley. 
[00:19:30]  But he calls him Pips, because it makes it easier.  Pips is their producer.  I am fucking confused, man.  Wow.  How do you keep track?  So why don't they call it the Ron and Pips show?  No, no, no.  It would be Chris Pepper Hicks, Stanley.  So call it Ron and Pepper.  That was proposed last week, actually.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Was it?  Yeah.  By who? 
[00:20:00]  A caller.  Oh.  Oh.  And Ron offered.  That caller was Tim Sabian.  Ron offered that position to Chris Pepper Hicks, Stanley.  But Chris Pepper Hicks, Stanley, declined.  What do you mean?  We tried to get him on the phone?  No.  I'm sorry.  I just, I zoned out for a second.  You should have.  Wait.  You should have.  The whole other conversation we just happened.  How do you run a show like this?  What do they decline?  There's no way I'm redoing the whole thing. 
[00:20:30]  No, do they decline an offer to get on the phone?  I was, uh, I guess they, I guess they, they want to call it the Ron and Pepper show.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.  But Pepper said no because he likes being called pips or something.  And who the hell is Shelby?  What's Shelby?  Shelby is their intern who's also, uh, a prominent, uh, on-air character.  He sits in Anthony's garage.  Yes.  Ron talks to Chris Pepper Hicks, Stanley, and Shelby on the air.  Right.  In lieu of Fez. 
[00:21:00]  Uh-huh.  Who's Lou?  No, no, no.  Lou!  Lou!  Seinfeld!  Yeah, very good.  Is it?  Yeah.  Ooh!  I had no idea.  I thought that was Bela Lugosi.  No.  That was a...  So, was pot involved with this thing?  Pot?  Are we talking potheads that come in after us?  Uh-huh.  I don't know if they...  Because why else would someone, like, go after our, uh, our cereal like that?  Like an animal.  They're either animals or they're smoking marijuana.  I'm so sick of slobs. 
[00:21:30]  There's a lot of them around here.  Another slob is among us.  Another slob.  Is it true that when you guys come into the studio in the morning, it is left in, let's  say, disarray from, uh, the night before?  I knew you were going to come up and say that.  Yes?  Oh, fuck.  Disarray.  This is going to cause problems.  Is it?  Comment?  Someone?  Mars, is it in disarray?  You're the first to see the studio.  You're the first one in here.  This is going to cause problems, you said, uh, Opster?  It's better to just air this all out at this point. 
[00:22:00]  We got an open box of Cinnamon Crunch here.  That's right.  We've been fucking assaulted.  Honestly, when I come in the morning...  Looks like a raccoon went out.  Right?  What?  When I come in the mornings, uh, it looks like the studio's been mistreated.  Headphones are always on the floor.  Oh, my God.  The let's, uh, the keyboard's always over there, where Opie is, and the mouse is over  there, and the one that bothers me the most is that the headphones are being treated like  shit.  Who comes in here at night?  Who the fuck is using this place at night?  Oh, my God.  Why do you guys look at me? 
[00:22:30]  I'm not here at night.  Oh, for sure.  You know the scuttlebutt.  Everyone talks to you.  Really?  Because we were promised that no one would use the studio at night, but then we're not  here, so obviously they'd probably just say, oh, fuck, use the studio.  They'll never know.  Nick Hicks uses the studio at night.  He does a lot of production, and he uses the studio as a production room.  Do you know, wouldn't you think for the company of this stature of Sirius XM Satellite Radio  that if anybody is using any studio, there'd be a log, like, okay, between this hour and  this hour, you've got to sign in and make sure that, you know, you know who's in what 
[00:23:00]  studio at what time, so if there is a problem, it can be addressed a lot easier without having  to chase someone around.  We have a security.  They have security cameras here.  Yeah, but it would be nice and easy if somebody just had to sign in, if it was company policy  to sign in if you're going to use the studio and sign out when you leave.  I assure you it's Pepper Hicks using the studio.  Oh, okay.  So now you're saying with certainty that it is indeed Pepper Hicks.  Using the studio.  You're on the oath, you know.  Using the studio. 
[00:23:30]  Now, is he leaving the headphones on the floor?  I don't know.  And especially, I'll tell you why, especially after Sunday, Monday mornings, it's really  a big mess.  So that means somebody's using the studio Sunday.  That's different.  Thank God, Pepper Hicks.  Thank God my Sunday shows are pre-taped.  Now, is Pepper with Chris Stanley when he's in the studio?  Yes.  Okay.  So you get, like, now it's twice the fucking problem.  No.  What?  It's Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley is his name. 
[00:24:00]  I don't care what order you want to put them in.  There's two guys fucking this place up.  One guy.  What?  It's crazy.  You're missing my air quotes.  Now you're just crazy talk.  What are you talking about?  Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley.  Okay.  So is Pepper Hicks like the stunt boy?  No.  He's the other guy.  It's obvious there's a Chris, there's a Stanley, and then there's a Pepper Hicks.  No, it's one guy.  And usually, like, the wacky name is the stunt boy.  All four of those words are accredited to one man.  So it's Chris and Stanley in the afternoons? 
[00:24:30]  Pepper!  Pepper!  Accelerate the car toward the wall, Pepper!  Right?  No.  No, it's Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley.  That's one guy.  Yeah, that's all right.  They should get some fucking production going.  That sounds cool.  No, it's one person.  Mm-hmm.  Does anybody else use the studio on the weekend?  I don't know.  Eastside Dave McDonald?  Oh, and you know who comes in with Eastside Dave?  Pepper Hicks.  Chris Pepper Hicks.  Stanley.  Uh-huh.  That's a lot of people for one studio.  He's the common denominator of sloven, slovenness. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I think that the principal would be standing there holding his shoulder going,  this slovenly sloppy boy.  Joe Brown.  So who's going to fess up?  Principal Joe Brown.  Yeah.  Who's going to fess up to the cereal thing?  Yeah.  Call him on the phone.  Who do you think?  Someone call him on the phone.  Uh, we need to know who is fucking a pig enough that they rip open a box of our cereal  after E-Rock instructed three people not to open it up. 
[00:25:30]  Well, who are the suspects?  Chris Stanley, Pepper Hicks, and, uh, and, and Stanley.  And Pip McGillicuddy.  And Pips.  Okay, so far that Chris Pepper Hicks, Stanley.  Oh.  They're all guilty.  Who would have the most time during the Ronda Fez show to eat?  Oh.  During the show?  Uh-huh.  You mean the person that's not talking all the time?  I think we all know the answer to that.  Aren't you still in Dutch with Fez?  Well, yeah.  Fez decided to take it up with me because I said his bits don't pan out. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, shit!  Like...  But wouldn't you have to do bits?  His bits...  Oh!  His bits don't pan out.  And he never takes it up with Opie, if you'll notice.  Anytime I open my mouth, he's got something to say.  But Opie's taking shots and he's afraid.  What are you talking...  I don't take shots.  What are you talking about, man?  Don't get me involved, please.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  I was out of line.  Yeah.  I just have questions.  Were you ever. 
[00:26:30]  How do we go forward here and find out who is the fucking Cinnamon Toast Crunch Thief?  Ron's the man.  He'll fucking figure it out for us.  That's true.  Ronnie will fuck in.  Ron is the man and he'll figure it out for us.  He's not going to like this shit.  Rule his kingdom with an iron fist.  And hopefully he gives someone a scolding.  But you never know.  He may protect his people, though, even though Ron is a...  You know, he likes professionalism.  He does.  He does.  He'd protect his people if he thought his person was right and he was being...  unjustly accused of something.  Right.  But if his person was actually doing something, he'll fucking want to get to the bottom of 
[00:27:00]  it.  Absolutely.  That's insubordination.  Well, did we try calling...  Yeah, we called Chris Pepper Hicks Stanley and got his voicemail.  And we're trying to get Pips on.  All right.  So give the other two guys a call, then.  Yeah.  It's going to take a bit.  What if it was Fez Watley?  Do you think Fez...  Does Fez stay in there?  That doesn't strike me as a Fez thing, though.  No.  He has.  And then again, maybe Fez was having a weird moment and he ate some cereal.  I don't think that.  Could happen. 
[00:27:30]  Sure.  I don't think he...  Weird things have happened.  Munching away on the cereal.  Some of these pills make you...  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Just eat.  Oh, my God.  This will not be pleasant.  I'm talking about my mom.  Oh.  Assholes.  You don't like when you see people just consuming.  Well, they're walking around a bit of a daze from their pills to keep their me, me, me down.  And they just...  Oh. 
[00:28:00]  Jeez.  Oh.  That's such a gluttonous face.  Oh, boy.  And they don't even know.  Hey, what happened to all the food?  Fucking, I hate slobs.  All voicemails so far.  For the three guys?  The Chris Stanley fucking Pepper Show or whatever?  Snoozing with big fat bellies full of cinnamon toast crunch.  They're hibernating off our fucking cereal. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, a cinnamon breath.  Yep.  Oh, just eat themselves into a coma.  Now I got a nap for eight hours.  Ha, ha, ha.  Hey, Jesus.  Yeah, I think Rami will get to the bottom of it.  He sure will, Anthony.  He sure will.  We need to.  Because we can't have, you know...  How do we do cereal day with a half a box of cinnamon toast crunch?  And I'm not going to eat the cinnamon toast crunch knowing that some fucking filthy paw was digging in there. 
[00:29:00]  Ugh.  Who knows where it's been.  Exactly.  That's disgusting.  Absolutely.  Fucking...  Why should you eat something unhealthy like that?  With someone's fucking dirty germs on it.  Ugh.  Iraq, who did this?  Nasty hand, dirty fingernails.  I don't know.  Pulling at it like a fucking raccoon.  Although, let's be honest.  I imagine, you know, there are certain things that you might have drunk that would probably kill any germs that might be on it.  Well, that's true.  But, you know, it's a little more enjoyable.  I don't want man hands in there. 
[00:29:30]  Terrible.  Even if it was a filthy girl, at least it's a girl.  Some guy with chewed fingernails digging in.  Oh, God.  I don't mind filthy girls.  I don't even like clean guys.  Get your fucking hands out of there.  All right.  Iraq, you don't know.  No theory?  No.  You know.  He's got a theory.  Of course you have a theory.  I can't tell you.  It's whoever owns this bag of books and DVDs has this. 
[00:30:00]  It's the one that opened the cereal.  What books are in there and what DVDs?  Let's do a little investigating.  Okay.  It's just a bag.  We're allowed to look into a bag.  Well, the bag is from Barnes & Noble where the Ron and Fez show usually purchases stuff.  They go to Barnes & Noble?  Yeah.  For what?  For what?  Whenever they have a guest come in, they get stuff signed by the guest.  It's always from Barnes & Noble.  How unprofessional?  Oh.  Wow.  You both know about reading?  Let's see. 
[00:30:30]  BBC World News presents Kung Fu Nuns.  Wow.  BBC World News.  There's another copy of that.  Awful book.  And then a copy of Everyday Enlightenment, Walking the Path to Happiness in the Modern World.  That's the day of my new book.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I think we just cracked this case.  Oh, boy.  I think that's the glove and the Bruno Mali shoe. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Someone's trying to get some happiness.  Oh.  Aw.  Or in self-help books rule.  In OJ's current life, that's the crushed oatmeal cookies under the shirt.  Yes, it is.  Sam will.  I was hungry.  We'll get to the oatmeal cookie fucking thing.  You just relax.  We're not ready yet.  Everyday Enlightenment.  Aw.  Aw.  What are the chapters? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, Kung Fu Nunches is a movie.  Yeah.  I see.  Wow.  What do we got there?  Well, it's divided into three books.  Oh, what?  The first book is The Uncommon Path.  Uh-huh.  The chapters are Enjoy the Journey.  Ah.  Oh, we all know that.  Enjoy the Journey.  The destination's never as good as The Journey.  That's, um...  I did.  I saw them back in probably 82, and it was great. 
[00:32:00]  They did all the hits.  What?  Nice.  No?  Uh, Take In the Scenery.  Hmm.  Yep.  Walking Together.  Walking Together.  One Step Leads to Another.  One Step Leads to Another.  I'll tell you something wrong.  I know I listened to...  What?  Can we do Fix Day today?  I can't believe it.  We might have three Fix songs.  One thing...  Oh, that's in excess.  ...leads to another one. 
[00:32:30]  Right, right.  No, no, that's Fix.  And...  Fix...  Yeah, Fix, right?  Yeah, that's Fix.  And then they got Red Skies at Night, so that's two.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh!  Oh!  What else?  What else?  I love this.  Step Lightly.  Step Lightly.  Yes.  Slow Down for Clearer Vision.  Slow Down for Clearer Vision.  Okay.  The next book is called Walking Your Path. 
[00:33:00]  Develop Your Compassionate Mind.  Act With Love and Kindness.  Be Generous, colon.  Aid, Inspire, and Protect.  Be Generous, colon, Aids.  Can I see that book?  Do you want to just...  You want to finish reading the chapters?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, you can...  I just want to see the book.  I think it's signed.  Oh, wait.  Make sure it's not signed.  Is it signed?  By who?  Inside the first page.  I mean, I wonder if they interviewed  the person who...  Who's the author?  This guy.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:30]  What?  I'm just trying to find all the signatures.  I think you are...  Oh, there.  I think it's...  I think it's right there at the top of the room.  Oh, what?  It's served in half.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  By the holiness guy.  But who is it?  What?  Who is it signed by?  I don't...  I'm trying to...  If it was important, they wouldn't have left it  in the fucking...  Yeah, I don't know.  At the scene of the Cinnamon Toast Crunch crime.  On the floor.  It was...  Just imagine this is a fresh box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  Oh. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Oh, what?  Ripping the box open.  Wait.  Oh, I don't know who it's signed by  because that part is a little...  I would assume the author.  Yeah.  But who is he?  I don't know.  The author is His Holiness the Gilwang Drukpa.  What?  He was here yesterday.  The guy that shot up Garden City yesterday?  No?  I was sworn it was.  Can you make out the signature or...  It's in here somewhere.  What?  Yeah, I don't...  Maybe it's in the...  Let me see if it's past this part. 
[00:34:30]  Oh.  Let's see.  Oh, is it there?  No, it's not behind there.  Maybe there.  No.  Try the other one.  That one?  It's got to be there.  Yeah.  No?  Oh.  Let me see.  Oh, God.  I don't really see a signature in here.  I saw half of one on the page way back.  Well, I mean, you know,  we could tape it back together, I guess.  Yeah.  Tape is very handy in these instances.  Covers ripped off.  There it is.  So many pieces.  Leave it on the floor for the next show. 
[00:35:00]  Well, of course,  if that's how they want to do things.  Oh, boy.  I have no problem with it.  Oh, boy.  Man.  Now, here's the question.  Do we go and get another box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?  Yes, we do.  I mean...  Of course he rocks.  Funny stuff,  you even got the scent and sound.  Do we have to yell at you sometimes?  Come on, comment, buddy, boy, right there.  Boy, that was timing. 
[00:35:30]  No secret whispers in the ear on that one.  Boy, that was perfect timing.  That's really strange to see.  Yes, we understand that that book is from an author, I guess.  Oh.  From Ron and Fez.  I had them as a guest yesterday.  Oh, well.  I gather.  All right.  No one cares about that guy's signature, though.  I don't know.  He might be a hard-to-get guy.  Nah.  Are you kidding?  He's putting out Kung Fu nun fucking videos?  Maybe there's some nuns that do Kung Fu when he's writing about them or doing movies. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Ladies, do it in camera.  This is bad.  The DVDs are not signed.  Say, if they really gave a shit.  Maybe they...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's try it.  Sign it right there.  I'm sure he didn't have to leave quickly so he could get on another show.  That's a terrible guest.  Wow.  I don't know what I'd do with that guy.  So, are nuns good at Kung Fu?  Yeah.  Oh, they are.  So, um, this enlightenment, this walking another path, what does that mean? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, that pleasant feeling of...  Shut up.  Eee.  All right.  There you go.  Well, we didn't find out who took the cinnamon toast crunch.  I'm going to say that Pepper Stuart Hicks Seamus guy.  He might have too many names for radio.  So, E-Rock, do you have any idea who handles the autographs at Ron and Fez?  Um, usually it's an intern and Fez. 
[00:37:00]  Oh.  What if it's an intern?  I could not imagine an intern doing that.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess I could.  Although they're broke and hungry all the time, right?  Fired so fired, though.  Literally hungry.  Not hungry like fucking, you know, let me get my career going.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  They're literally, they want a fistful of cinnamon toast crunch hungry.  Sure, yeah.  And as far as the work ethic, it's usually, you know, go fuck your mother.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I said we do cereal day. 
[00:37:30]  Fucking listeners strapping.  Saved by Zero, is that fix?  I don't know, was it?  I don't think so.  No.  Why?  I think they just had Red Sky at Night.  No, man.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I'm going to go Saved by Zero as a fix song as well.  What about Deeper and Deeper?  Does that?  No.  There's multiple cuts of that.  No, you got Red Skies.  Red Skies at Night.  There's a bunch of fix stuff. 
[00:38:00]  One thing leads to another.  Saved by Zero is in here.  All right.  Saved by Zero.  Give me the Saved by Zero for a second.  I didn't know that was them.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  It sounds fixy.  You know this song.  Oh, hell yeah.  All right.  And then there's Are We Ourselves.  Does that sound familiar?  I think so, yeah.  I'm going to put them at three songs that matter.  Yeah?  I think so.  Whoa.  What?  I just got some information on my Twitter. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know if it's true.  Oh, all right.  Okay.  Turn off the fix.  We'll get back to the fix.  It's okay.  Don't you worry.  We'll get back to that song, everybody.  It all goes into the evidence pile, which can be looked at with varying degrees of credibility.  Credibility.  Sure.  His tweet is coming from World's Worst Twee.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And this guy says there's audio from yesterday's Ron and Fez show of Ronnie saying, Pips having  another bowl of cereal. 
[00:39:00]  What?  That's what this Twitter user is saying.  Holy shit.  Does it say what time in the show?  It does not.  All right.  Just fast forward real quick and look for something that sounds like Uriel.  Oh, man.  Really?  Well, now, if we get that clip, it's wrapped up.  That is the testimony right there that we need.  Wow.  Right from Ronnie B's mouth implicating Pip. 
[00:39:30]  Who is Pip?  What's his name?  His real name's Nick, but he goes by Pips.  Nick Pip.  Pips.  Pips.  Pips.  Yeah.  I have no idea.  All right.  I'd love to hear that.  Absolutely.  Oh, look.  Pips having another bowl of cereal.  They're looking for it in the back.  And was Pips told by you? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Right after we ended-  Holy shit.  Right after we ended Jimmy's show, I came in here-  A blatant disregard of Iraq's fucking thoughts, huh?  I told him, and he said yes.  Nobody's gonna-  You're a good detective, Iraq.  Iraq, yes.  You're strong.  Yeah.  Shows up to the crime scene fucking-  After everything's gone.  A little late.  Get it?  Like yesterday.  Jesus.  Jesus. 
[00:40:30]  Should we do material now?  Should we-  Yeah, I guess so.  Should we start our radio show?  I guess.  Yeah.  That's Serial Gate.  We'll cut in with any developments-  Oh, of course.  And let you know how Serial Gate progresses.  If we find that sound clip, wow, you people will be the-  Well, probably the 10th or 12th people in the world.  All right.  Yeah.  Iraq's very excited.  Oh, yeah.  Is he?  He's on a mission.  Yeah.  He wants to get to the bottom of this one.  He's making up for yesterday's debacle.  He sure is. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Now he's showing he's valuable in case things go missing.  Uh-huh.  Right.  Using that old gray matter up there.  That really is inappropriate to touch another person's food.  Ah!  His detective skills.  The hell is this?  Jeez.  What happens if we find out they didn't do it and then their book just got ripped for  no reason?  Yeah.  That happens.  That book was a piece of shit anyway.  No one cared about it.  Lifting a bag on the floor.  That's right.  Take care of your stuff.  Apparently, if you leave stuff in there, it doesn't matter. 
[00:41:30]  It doesn't matter.  It's not to be respected, right?  Isn't that what we learned?  Well, that's the lesson I just taught.  Right.  Them.  If you leave stuff in the control room, it is not to be respected as other people's property.  You can do as you please with it.  So, the book, a victim of that rule that we didn't even implement.  That's right.  That rule was implemented.  But if anyone's to blame for that tattered book laying on the floor next to Opie, it's  members of the Ron and Fez show. 
[00:42:00]  Starring those three guys.  For like ten fucking people, apparently.  Chris, Pepper, Hicks, Stanley is just one man.  Believe it or not.  No.  How do you get Pepper, Hicks, out of Chris, Stanley?  Because, uh, uh...  And then he shortens the whole thing and just says Pips, because he knows people are fucking  confused.  Yeah, yeah.  Pepper, Hicks, Pips.  I get it.  Pips is actually a different guy.  I don't think so.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  Jimmy, oh.  So, wait, his name is Pepper, but he goes by... 
[00:42:30]  His name is Chris, but he goes by Pepper?  Correct.  Why?  Wow!  It doesn't make sense.  Can I see the bamboo...  Uh, the bamboo...  The baboon, uh, video.  You want to feel better?  Let me see.  Okay, let me look up on the...  No, no, no.  Oh, by the way, I took your suggestion last night.  Oh!  And I saw the Morton Downey Jr. documentary.  Yes, pretty good, huh?  The Evocateur.  Pretty good, right?  It was all right.  I liked it.  I want to see it.  They got a little weird with their fucking... 
[00:43:00]  The animation?  Animations and stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  I kind of liked that animation.  Was that for the potheads or something?  I guess.  It was kind of dramatized.  It was pretty good.  I liked it.  The one thing, and I think you brought it to the discussion last time, I can't believe  he was only on the air for two years.  I know.  It seemed like he was a fixture.  It did, right?  Yeah.  And just to see all the really, you know, big guests he had in the beginning, and then  they explained how no one wanted to do his show anymore because it was so ridiculous. 
[00:43:30]  They didn't know at first.  Yeah, you jackass...  But they had a young Ron Paul on?  I know, yeah.  He's yelling and screaming at a young Ron Paul?  Yep.  About what?  Ron Paul.  He wanted to legalize drugs, I believe.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Him with his fucking...  And you know, that cigarette coffee breath right in your face like that.  Oh, it couldn't have been good.  Oh, man.  And then the hole where he set up that publicity stunt and it failed miserably.  Oh, that was his complete and utter...  And then his friend.  Was he having, like, gay sex with that guy? 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  What was that about?  What was he sleeping together, spooning in a bed?  Well, they said they used to sleep in the same bed when they were on the road together.  Spooning?  But they said that there was nothing going on.  But that guy was a little strange, too, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was he married, Morton Downey?  A couple times.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And then he had a young wife at the end of his life that he was obsessed with.  Oh, yeah.  But it was pretty good.  It's called the Evocateur, right? 
[00:44:30]  Yes.  He had Gloria Allred on his show back in the day.  Yeah.  And she was trying to say that they had sexual energy or something, or sexual tension.  I'm like, God, no.  What?  You've got to be shitting me.  Who has sexual energy with that thing?  Yeah.  And then, of course, Reverend Al.  Reverend Al, big fat Reverend Al on stage getting pushed over backwards in his chair.  And isn't he using...  He was yelling punk faggot or something, right? 
[00:45:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Reverend Al was?  Oh, yeah, the Morton Downey Jr. show, because it was all about confrontation.  So somebody in the audience said something that Reverend Al didn't like, and he's calling  him a punk faggot.  Punk faggot.  We should play that every morning.  That should be in the intro, is Al Sharpton's fucking quotes.  Yes.  Punk faggot.  Yeah.  So he understands this game.  He did it himself.  Now he's a big star.  So he's I'm is fired.  MSNBC.  Yeah, but he gets I'm is fired.  Are you kidding me?  Knowing his history.  He's got the president's ear.  You ain't nothing to be a punk faggot.  Now, come on, do something. 
[00:45:30]  There he is.  You a punk faggot.  You ain't nothing.  You a punk faggot.  Now, come on, do something.  There you go.  Why didn't MSNBC put that in the fucking beginning of the show?  There you go.  And fuck the fucking blueberry pie.  There's the guy that was the reason Imus got fired right there.  And Imus should have just played that over and over again.  And there's a lot of clips of Reverend Al saying some, you know, outrageous stuff.  We don't think it's outrageous.  But, you know, if you're going to call other people out, maybe you shouldn't make sure you're a bit cleaner with your language. 
[00:46:00]  The White House talks to the president.  Right.  There you go.  That's great.  So the evocator.  Check it out.  Pretty cool.  Char.  So what happened here?  You got a baboon and it grabs the titty of the reporter, right?  Yeah.  They're doing a live shot, you know, and a cute little baboon just decided to cop himself a feel of a nice titty.  Whoops.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you got it.  All right.  Well, I was thinking about.  Oh, sorry. 
[00:46:30]  Those things are fucking nasty, man.  I know.  What?  Baboons are fucking.  Yeah, yeah.  Tits.  Tits.  Baboons.  Come on, Sam.  I want to see the tit grab.  Go full screen.  Let me see it.  Oh, man.  He's climbing her back.  And they zoom in.  And he's got those teeth.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  This is my bitch.  He's just holding her teeth, staring straight ahead. 
[00:47:00]  His teeth are just.  Wow.  They love grapes and apparently melons.  Back to you.  Tit joke.  Back to you in the studio.  They're horrified.  So, you know, that baboon's teeth would really cause a problem.  Imagine that being sunk into your fucking chest.  He's basically going, that's right.  I'm grabbing her tip.  What do you even do about it?  Yeah.  Mine.  Exposing his teeth like that.  I think when they show their teeth, at least with chimps, you don't smile at them.  Someone told me that's a sign of aggression or masculine, whatever the fuck it is.  Sure.  Like, you know, we smile at each other like, hi. 
[00:47:30]  But if you get to a baboon, they fucking attack you.  Wow.  Really?  Or a chimp.  Yeah.  Damn.  I could be wrong.  Any chimp experts, please.  On instant feedback.  I was thinking about tits the other day.  Oh, you were just the other day?  Yeah.  I was just thinking that.  Big ones?  No.  I was just thinking a lot of tits look very kind of ridiculous if they're not using, if  they're not being used sexually.  That was my thought the other day.  They're amusing? 
[00:48:00]  They just look ridiculous.  Oh.  If they're not being used sexually.  Right.  Like, when they're just walking about.  Girls will say the same thing about the schlong, but at least you can't see the schlong  when you're walking around, you know, with clothes on.  Because, you know, they're trying to do their everyday activities and they're kind of slumped  forward a little bit, which makes them kind of look even more silly and ridiculous at  times.  I got to say, what a hassle having those things if you got to, like, fucking do something.  I don't know how you do that.  Like, the girls walking around the streets, you're just like, they got to carry those 
[00:48:30]  with them everywhere.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Terrible.  But then all they have to do is arch their back a little bit like that.  They don't look ridiculous anymore.  Oh.  Right.  And a good sneak peek.  A girl bending over with, like, a low neckline.  Yes.  To kind of see down the shirt.  Yes.  And you could go online or you could go to strip club.  There's plenty of places to see tits.  But when you see that sneak shot.  It really is.  Yeah, yeah.  Something special.  The sneak peek. 
[00:49:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That's called Creepin'.  Yeah, Creepin'.  That's called Creepin'.  Very appropriate name.  All right.  We did nothing this first hour.  No, no.  We started a case.  We started the great cinnamon toast crunch thievery case.  Do you want to hear something adorable?  Ooh, yes.  You remember the Apple Jacks song?  Yes.  When I sing it, I say A is for Apple, J is for Jacks, Simmon and Toasty, Apple Jacks. 
[00:49:30]  Whoa.  Uh, really delicious, crunchy too, Kellogg's Apple Jacks.  Of course you know the whole thing.  I know.  I just remember that one dumb line, which I sing adorably.  Do you think it's adorable?  No.  That is.  Do you say-  It's fairly typical of children, actually.  Do you say Piscchetti?  Yes, I do.  Or I mean, now I sing it that way.  And Nacken, Nacken, Nacken, Nacken, Nacken, Nacken, Nacken, Nacken, Nacken, yeah.  It's quite with a cloth or a sleeve.

[00:55:30]  yeah so no one has to witness that what's wrong with you man that crap a bunch of crap  so what tes  the fucking nfl is suing mia for 1.5 million that's why i hate the nfl well the mia broad  uh gave the finger at the super bowl last year oh my god how many people were injured by that  who performed last year madonna nikki minaj and mia madonna nikki minaj and mia yeah yeah she came 
[00:56:00]  out and she was like a badass like fuck and we're like yeah fuck yeah yeah it's corny but it's like  cool man that 1.5 million dollars i love this fucking song i'm sorry i have to say it i love this  fucking song before we talk about mia we got to get to the hook oh that's right  i like people like you can tell their english even when they sing yeah i'm very suspect of those 
[00:56:30]  people that sing and they sound american yeah like where's the gunshots it's coming up all right  has this song been banned by any radio stations yet for the gunshots it's pretty old no i know it's 
[00:57:00]  not really on radio anymore i think they made a radio edit without gunshots why would of course  so anyway that brought she was at the super bowl last year she gave the finger and uh i don't know  was there even an uproar about it it's at first there was i wouldn't say an uproar it was a couple  days right be like oh look what happened if that and and uh was there an fcc violation or any of that 
[00:57:30]  shit well that's what i'm wondering is the 1.5 million to cover an fcc no the fcc uh did not levy  any fine so what's the basis just a scumbag legal team so that this is why i fucking hate the nfl  the nfl wants it i just did this with it they're fucking everyone how many criminals are in the  fucking nfl how many fucking problems do they have with drugs or steroids or all that murderers  you know what i mean or whatever it is or guys drunk driving mia was great because she said  i'm not going to pay you anything for flipping off the camera it's more offensive that cheerleaders are 
[00:58:00]  rubbing their crotches in the camera every single day yeah 16 year old girls whatever black girls  you see yeah fuck the fuck the nfl right that's that's why i can't but this is an old story why  are they bringing this back and they're still in court i guess this is what nine months ago right  yeah now but i guess they're suing her now that is fucked up yeah the nfl is a weird fucking  organization they really are they're really strange they got off easy with the whole concussion thing too 
[00:58:30]  yeah they only had to pay uh i think just shy of 800 million that was a piece of cake for those  guys yeah but that's what they worry about how about the fucking nfl starts going after stadiums  for putting those taxes on people for buying seats right how about they do that right fucking greedy  fucks that's just weird where where does that all come from they just they don't want them really  celebrating that much after a big play and or a sack they want wholesome family entertainment 
[00:59:00]  like baseball it's the it's it's guys running full it's monsters monsters i can't even call them call  them guys they're monsters every time i'm next to a football player i'm like you're a monster  yeah you don't have the same dna as as as anyone else and they uh and they run full speed at each  other yeah every play there's a very good chance someone's gonna you know fuck up not not only their  careers but their lives they're gonna walk around like cripples half these guys 10 years after they 
[00:59:30]  leave the league don't even remember they were in the league but fuck we can't handle a fuck you know  someone uh doing a little touchdown dance yes or spinning the ball they don't want the the spinning of  the ball anymore spinning at a ball and then they go off to go after this broad for uh flipping the  finger even though it was never a problem for anybody yeah but no one cares it's unbelievable  no one cares all right i'm on that day we got a great story we really do oh yeah this was my favorite 
[01:00:00]  of the day we got a great story our old pal our old pal oj simpson was back in the news the oj yes back  in the news and uh and a little bit a little bit of trouble and you're asking you know how did that  happen and he's in prison you know and i heard he's been a model prisoner yep you know but apparently  oh boy you know figuratively speaking someone got caught with his hand in the cookie jar oh wait a 
[01:00:30]  minute  i like that yes oj simpson um got caught stealing cookies from the prison cafeteria  i swear to you if we sat down and started writing bits again which would be weird in itself  yeah yeah and we go look let's do it like a goof that oj is stealing cookies in prison people be 
[01:01:00]  like yeah yeah that's stupid he uh just really happened yeah what kind of cookies were they saying  oatmeal cookies oatmeal cookies are delicious they have the raisins in them oh generally speaking  and what do you go walnuts oh no no nuts stop with the putting nuts in anything if you want to eat  nuts by themselves have at it but don't contaminate good food by putting the overbearing texture and  taste of nuts and shit be i have a brownie they're beautiful fucking soft silky creaminess brownie nice 
[01:01:30]  and then the walnuts crunch no get them out of there that brings it all together  doesn't eat them no and it also keeps the goodness together no yes ice cream with nuts in it oh it's  creamy i don't like that creamy called crunch no nuts don't belong in anything how about a toffee  no i hate toffee you don't like fucking toffee and ice hershey a hershey chocolate bar with nuts 
[01:02:00]  no you're eating chocolate chocolate tastes good and then almonds no almond or is it almonds  i'll give you i'll give you almonds chocolate with almonds no i like that i hate dark chocolate with  some almonds no yes i like a good almond no in chocolate i do a little crunch mixing just to mix  things up it's gotta be creamy creamy and a good crunch you don't like what kind of peanut butter do you  like oh crunchy always i don't like peanut butter at all oh you're just but if i have i was i was 
[01:02:30]  forced to eat peanut butter uh years ago why did you have a dog outfit on indeed indeed i was uh  starving but what do you mean forced everyone loves peanut butter no no unless you're one of those  allergic kids no no i'm allergic i never liked peanut butter uh growing up and then when i was  in my late teens early 20s and i was pretty much starving um i would eat you know i had to eat peanut 
[01:03:00]  butter it was in the house that i was staying at right i would i would eat it and i didn't like  peanut butter i could eat peanut butter jelly every day that would be my that that dumb bit one food  if you could eat one food if you're trapped on a desert and you could only eat one food  why would be peanut butter jelly i would eat pizza oh fuck pizza is pretty fucking good  delicious it's pretty good i like to i used to like to lick the crust and sniff it when it was  burned you are you are so weird with that sniffing thing i know lick look at how big it's excited 
[01:03:30]  i don't know why i would do that no do you know why no no no no it doesn't stink it smells just like  the food but why don't you like peanut butter that's a good point uh it's it just i don't like the taste  of peanut butter oh my god it's it's it's that right it's it's that gaggish fucking thick uh and  it's just like too overpowering of peanut you know there it is big peanut taste in your fucking face 
[01:04:00]  fuck that give me i used to eat just jelly sandwiches just jelly or uh or or just marshmallow  fluff without the nutter part what about margarine and uh jelly sandwiches margarine it's terrible  where were you nana's house i didn't say i well i had we did her butter we'd have or everyone's  while you know for a goof we'd have real butter in the house how was that that would ruled you  realize how shitty margarine especially back then the real deal nowadays you can't you can barely 
[01:04:30]  tell the difference yeah back then those dumb yogurt uh spreads taste just like butter for the most  part yes in moderation what is it brumnal or something brown brum i don't know the fucking  brand but dude i was a huge peanut butter and jelly fan yeah and then when i started uh realizing i had  some allergies i was an allergic boy i decided to self-diagnose myself and i uh stopped eating  peanut butter for five years and it wasn't the peanut butter all right because then i decided after 
[01:05:00]  five years after self-diagnosing myself i was still a sneezy mess i finally went to an allergist after  five years buck you put your fingers into peanut butter right and and then they did the whole needle  test yeah and they're like okay and i'm like which one is the peanut butter one like that one you're  not allergic to peanuts ah you want to know what i did that day what four peanut butter and jelly  sandwiches just to get back into it get back into peanut butter yeah not even reese's no i don't like any 
[01:05:30]  peanut butter candy um i i i don't like peanut butter it's too overpowering for anything else that  you're eating you might as well just have a spoonful of peanut butter with anything that you  have peanut butter in what about a banana and you dip it in a little peanut butter uh no i like bananas  don't like it in peanut butter i do should we get some peanut butter you'll be great right now some  vanilla ice cream you take the ice cream you dip it no you take a spoonful of peanut butter and then you 
[01:06:00]  dip it in the ice cream get out of here the ice cream off and you leave some peanut butter on the  spoon i've done that and then you go back in and take some more or get the peanut butter ice cream  oh you could do that too oh now people are saying that it's because uh of george washington carver  that i don't like they might be onto something george washington carver mr peanut oh this uh oh we were  talking about this because oj okay the former football star is currently serving 33 years in prison  for arm robbery we know the story and he apparently has a pretty big sweet tooth according to this 
[01:06:30]  article oh he was recently caught stealing cookies from the chow line by guards guards reportedly saw  simpson trying to hide something underneath his prison clothes as he walked back to his cell after lunch  one day and most prisoners are like trying to get a shank or some fucking drugs through or something  it's like hey what do you got there oh shit oh shit they're shaking down my cell i gotta hide my 
[01:07:00]  cookies after further investigation found that uh the former ufc usc standout had a stash of more  than a dozen oatmeal more than a dozen former murderer yeah how about that dozen yeah i think former  murderer at this point instead of uh former usc standout i wasn't eating them i was gonna mold him into a  a head and escape like an escape from alcatraz milk cookie oj head 
[01:07:30]  and they took his cookies away oh no yeah them's my cookies  he didn't seem uh contrite about his actions oj just stood there with a goofy grin on his face as  the guard kept digging inside his shirt and throwing the cookies on the floor that must have been some sight  we gotta find a real cookie thief this uh  what oh my god who's emily she's in the uh on the on fox news yeah she's from the blurred lines 
[01:08:00]  video oh that's the blurred lines video girl ridiculous so let so let's kidnap her what  let's kidnap her can we get her on the show wow yeah she's got a uh i think our listeners were  tweeting her because she must be the one the listeners were tweeting yesterday i i love by the  way that the listeners are trying to get us a guest for the show is that what they do yeah because this  broad she tweeted that she was gonna be on fox and friends she's on there right now she's beautiful 
[01:08:30]  and then our listeners got involved like hey while you're over there you know why don't you stop by and  do o and a of course all right and uh is that happening no of course not but sometimes it works  she's in blurred lines yeah yeah she's the uh brunette yeah yeah everyone loves her absolutely  so what is she doing now uh just talking about being in that video that's it yeah she's just a  model model slash actress oh sorry excuse me yeah gotta gotta get that in there all right so you got 
[01:09:00]  the guard throwing the cookies on the floor in front of oj but smuggling the sweet should have  been no laughing matter for simpson who was diagnosed by doctors with severe diabetes oh god love him  the diabetes  yeah he shouldn't be wolfing down oatmeal cookies oh man he looks like an idiot to his fellow prisoners  the next line's great the raid took the prisoners by surprise and many of them thought simpson had 
[01:09:30]  managed to smuggle in a cell phone or other banned items yeah something good now the word's getting  out that it's no no no no no just the cookies oh he has no cred because that would make him  a tough guy in prison right of course that he pulled that off so when the guards started pulling  cookies out of oj's shirt the other inmates started laughing so hard they nearly fell over 
[01:10:00]  i could throw this at someone's eye and really hurt them right oh j they probably love oj in jail they  do right oh i bet they just like he's probably the goofy guy like they love him as oj hey guys but  he's probably like look at that dumb oj motherfucker that goofy ass oj of course it's all black people  like you know when i do a prison impersonation it's always you know oh that oj it's never like oh 
[01:10:30]  like andy dufresne it's never andy dufresne no since like the fucking 30s  a lot of andy dufresne's left no there's not  i'm sure everyone by now has seen the uh the footage of the navy yard shooter holy oh yeah he's  kind of walking through the hallways with a shotgun crystal clear video oh yeah but my question is  what's what is uh what's the use for security footage if no one's noticing yeah right it's not 
[01:11:00]  like the movies somebody's sitting in front of a bank of those okay meh meh but this guy they have  so much footage of him before he even fired his first shot yeah where were the people checking  out the cameras does anyone know that yet i guess they felt um that uh one guard was uh quite enough  one armed guard yeah but when did he kill the the guard i don't know because they have him kill the 
[01:11:30]  guard i don't think he did oh that was just that that was just started by somebody stole his  shit i don't know but he's lurking in the hallways he's got his weapon and and it took a while before  you know he finally started his man yeah you watch that security footage you're like ah somebody could  have popped out of an office when he passed by and just shot him in the back of the head  end o story right there and of course they got other uh footage they've decided not to release 
[01:12:00]  that's gotta just be brutal like shooting footage we're watching him he's got the bag and look  there he's got a shot this is on a security camera he's like yeah let me just walk around there  oh oh boy no one in that office oh my god they were lucky in that office then he's running down these  stairs he goes through this uh door now he's hunched over now he's taking cover there's people down the  hall but he doesn't fire at them now he's running down the hall takes cover again that's all they  released yeah who the fuck was watching the cameras uh they probably just have him feeding 
[01:12:30]  into a server or something yeah that's probably just the after the fact stuff all right let's go  to that and see who was pilfering paper clips at the navy yard though you would think there'd be some  guy that's kind of you'd think taking a look well once clinton banned weapons from any military  fucking bases why did he what happened that was weird i don't know because you know he's anti-gun  democrat can you leave him alone he does a great impression of bono he does that's a great impression 
[01:13:00]  of him it's just amazing hilarious he's beloved it's really really funny i want i want hillary to  be in the white house just boy just because i want to see bill you want to see bill back in there  yeah i don't really believe in politics but if you got to pick somebody i say we go hillary so we  could have fun watching bill bill milling about the white house again yes yes out and about is this  the bono impression oh yeah let me let me uh listen to the bono impression or should we listen to the 
[01:13:30]  bono impression first uh of him doing clinton sure that would put it all in context yeah let's do that  yeah they went to some thing what is it the clinton fucking library organization but they all have  libraries yeah they all do it's some charitable thing yeah that they were uh doing they're calling  this spot on bono's spot on bill clinton impression you hear the fact that uh bono and bill clinton  work together and and you know know each other right but you realize they really do know each other when 
[01:14:00]  you do an impression of them like that and you don't feel like you know you're going to get  fucking flack for it or it's disrespectful or anything they're buddies you know they're drinking  bodies bill mocks i don't think he was mocking them i think he was having a little fun with them yeah  yeah that word is stupid in new york this morning bono had a little fun with former president clinton  this is an extraordinary when i first met bono hey he walked into the oval office and i actually 
[01:14:30]  i thought it was a member of his own road crew uh he wasn't really dressed right actually i felt like  the rock star on that occasion i must be really easy to make fun of now we move to russia no don't i bet  they're gonna get him thrown in jail for that yeah chip why would they fucking can't do that it's 
[01:15:00]  illegal is it illegal fuck yeah by the way you do it clinton didn't ban the guns you know that right  huh clinton didn't ban the guns oh what happened george w bush all right now here's uh bill clinton  doing bono yes not that good by the way just informed me in fact all of us that you do a pretty  good bono impression this is your chance mr president  boy this wasn't set up ahead of time right yes it was sunglasses bono sunglasses 
[01:15:30]  well i'm irish you know and we irish we can imitate anybody  fucking home run no we're not moving to russia fucking home run just like bono you liked that  fuck yeah why the fuck you know they want us to move to russia they want you to know what's going  on over there and why didn't they give you the long form of the impression on that clip 
[01:16:00]  don't know yeah how much time did he do with it that was bullshit oh he did it all day  yeah the clinton global initiative what that is sounds ominous it's where everybody gets uh blowjobs in  government facilities sure lest we forget he did get his dick sucked he's beloved though everyone loves  bill clinton he's doing impressions he's a jokester charitable guy globe trotter he's great he got his 
[01:16:30]  dick sucked in the oval office amazing that's why he's a rock star maybe that's why right and no one  cares no one cares at this point no one cares yeah that was pierce morgan we didn't play the clip of  uh pierce morgan going after those little boys that were suspended oh dear you heard this story right  what happened yeah you got the typical story you got a bunch of kids just being kids they got their  uh their their guns their fake guns their toy guns like we were talking about playing a little uh you 
[01:17:00]  know bang bang shoot them up in right in the yard with the row your friends right i think they were  doing in their in their yard waiting for the bus i believe uh-huh right yeah so it wasn't even on  it wasn't even in school no it's not even close so why are they suspended for the entire year that's  the story it was on the kid's private property it was on it was in his front yard zero tolerance  policy but the school has a zero tolerance policy the school doesn't have jurisdiction of your front 
[01:17:30]  yard they're about 10 feet away from a bus stop and there were a couple kids that said they were  shooting at us oh my yeah what's fucking babies but then again they are getting shot in school like  yeah but they're on their own property right that's that's the responsibility of the parent  yeah most people think the school is way out of line of course but uh the little kids were on  piers morgan yeah and piers dressed him down a little bit yeah he he said the school was out  of line but he made sure you know got his fatherly advice into those kids okay college i mean you 
[01:18:00]  apparently six times how old are these kids again uh probably 12 ish yeah that's what i thought  little smart asses yeah that's what they are 18 months you've been in trouble at school for as they  say harassment bullying and fighting have you been a naughty boy um i don't know how you how you feel  about being a naughty boy but um i do know that i have been in trouble in recent times uh oh and why is 
[01:18:30]  that using because i have a little bit of a temper oh boy and you're working to try and deal with that  yes sir fuck you okay aiden are you working to deal with your i don't know what your problem is  you don't seem to have the same disciplinary record have you been naughty as well or not naughty yes  so you both accept you've really gone too far right well yes so you're both going to be better boys and 
[01:19:00]  hope to get back to school as soon as possible yes well good look here's my interview because i've had  quite a strong view about guns in america and gun control as most people do you watch this show  know did he correct himself on the ar or whatever weapon thing that he talked about the uh no all of  them they had the same answer oh it doesn't matter what the weapon was that we got it wrong it doesn't  matter liar to the show no but in this case i can't help thinking the school's gone a bit too far this 
[01:19:30]  is a toy gun and this is not the same thing you know when i was a kid i used to play with toy guns  uh cap guns and whatever and you know they can't kill people and so i think you've both been pretty  harshly treated i think the school should rethink this i think carlid you need to get your own  behavioral pattern into a better order uh but i think that they've gone a little bit far in this case  yuck what a non-segment pierce had there that was just like right oh what did he think he was 
[01:20:00]  going to get some gold there i don't know you've been naughty naughty that just sounded creepy yeah  telling a child that it's been naughty couldn't take a stand one way or the other because he can't  really just say the school is being unfair because that would kind of with his anti-gun  anti-gun thing right i understand he has to tell the boys they were naughty before he can say yes  yes that one kid sounds like trouble the one with the temper problem why do you say that he's going 
[01:20:30]  to be an issue that's going to have to be dealt with uh in a couple of years perhaps have you seen  photos oh yeah yeah oh yeah i see an issue there that's all just the audio though yeah yeah you could  tell he's got a temper problem the other one is he's naughty he's been in trouble naughty naughty  i guess it means something different in england naughty naughty when we use naughty it's not about  no toy gun just when someone needs a spanking they've been naughty spanking maybe a digit slips in 
[01:21:00]  there yeah you've been naughty during the spanking at that bottom warm and red  your bottom needs to be firmly red in young ladies what's going on with uh cory booker  uh what the fuck was that about what's he chatting with some stripper yeah there was a  tweet a couple tweets went back and forth with a uh a lunatic stripper direct messages you like  those tattoos oh oh is she hot yes craig craig yeah i don't know i love her there's too much going on

[01:30:00]  on girls uh tattoos yeah nice big piece on a girl i like i like tattoos but not when they're big giant  pieces depends on the person on the like she's got those giant pieces on her like on her side leg  and uh right uh above her tats are like anything else you know it's very personal thing it's very um  subjective some of them look really good some look like some of the shitty ones look good on 
[01:30:30]  a certain person other ones need really good i'll tell you what i kind of been digging these days  though i kind of do like a side tat kind of looks cool um i don't know if that's going to be the the  the fucking tramp stamp of the 2010s you know um but of the millennials yeah yeah yeah but that's  that's kind of cool i like that um uh as far as little tats go i mean i think that's like just  jewelry i don't think that really matters like that that isn't like wow you're really committed  to get a tat a little something on the ankle a little something on the the wrist or something like 
[01:31:00]  that but if you're gonna have major work done on a girl i definitely like the side i don't like a  mucking up their ass at all that don't fucking or their or their breast anything yeah yeah yeah  eat that don't get anything like that something kind of i don't know yeah it depends if you also  if you know the girl before she has them or once like it depends on how someone looks when you meet  shoulders good on a girl too shoulder blade like a shoulder blade on a girl that i like too um but no 
[01:31:30]  i i'm not a big fan of uh of like tats um can i see a picture of that girl again i don't carry the  way like i don't uh if i like my ex had a tattoo and i'm like don't get any more because it looks  good on you with the one tattoo but you don't want to get too too many but then they always every  time someone gets a tat they want to get more yeah uh oh jimmy this guy's got a suggestion for  you all right cool nader it looks like nader in new york hey uh jimmy do you like her check out

[01:38:30]  married next scene he's shot himself in the head right enough for this purple obsession yeah get it  i love the time where we weren't allowed to call him anything yeah that was that was brilliant formerly  not and people bought into it and actually said that's the brilliance of prince man it was a legality  he had some kind of a legal issue i don't know what the issue was but i think he was circumventing 
[01:39:00]  it by saying that he probably uh he probably should have explained that better to the people  because uh the people just thought he was an asshole what the record company owned his name  or something and it was a legal fight or i don't know i don't know yeah maybe denny knows  you think denny has prince info and we'll never know  beatles released abbey road 44 years ago today too that's a big really that was a big  abbey road a couple of hits off of that one right um that's a bomb yeah not so much

[01:45:00]  though she has a great voice sean lennon is trapped in yoko's world yeah if he would just escape yoko's  world he would be an amazing pop musician julian had more of a john lennon vibe than sean ever even  could i don't think sean's got the talent dude sean sounds exactly like john lennon but it's all  fucked up with the yoko influence shit we've done this break i'm telling you i saw i saw  sean lennon in central park i was blown away and i'm like idiot i guess he just doesn't want to do 
[01:45:30]  it but i'm like do you understand if you just adjust your sound a little bit that you would be  a massive musician what is this sean lennon  he looks like he has that weird asian look though too so he looks like john lennon john lennon looked  like he was asian because he was high all the time yeah chinese eyes yes he looks like a young 
[01:46:00]  john lennon though please you don't like the other one much too late for goodbye that was julian  wait was that the 80s that song yeah that's a long time ago dead meat though  the rockstar kids that are obviously the rockstar kids are never successful he looks like down syndrome  fucking john lennon though i'm sorry james mccartney really does yeah no you're james mccartney right

[01:52:30]  this is the big one this was huge we couldn't play it on the only station that really rocks though  there's a rock and hard enough oh it had to rock what station played this probably kiss kiss fm  those kiss stations probably play yeah  what the fuck is this that's a great song you're gonna download this i'm telling you  making that guitar talk  so long ago i don't remember when this is nice i never heard it though 
[01:53:00]  how do you not hear this it's so weird to me were you in a coma during like a two-year  the 90s didn't exist for you maybe you'll know the only reason i find it weird i gotta say because  it was everywhere to the point where you couldn't avoid it yeah no never heard your music tastes  this is different you might know the cars oh it's not yet i would listen to bob grant when i was  going to gigs and then like jay diamond on the way home but if you walked into a restaurant if you 
[01:53:30]  walked into just a i don't know yeah a cbs even it's it's every this song was everywhere  if i've heard this it does not at all ring a bell that's straight you might know when the chorus comes  in yeah after this little ditty here we go here it comes here it comes  yes i've heard the chorus all right all right you scared me for a second there you can't lose  with a good chorus right right it's catchy yeah he's saying a lot better than his father did 
[01:54:00]  he's got like kind of that little twang to the voice but at least he's on key  you play the therapy fuck him it's bob dylan he stinks i do like i don't love him i'll give him  his writing but let some other people does a great radio show had a bunch of really cool songs  he's an asshole but the only time i saw bob dylan he he decided well i mean unlike neil young i mean 
[01:54:30]  bob dylan did play uh songs for us but but some of them were so unrecognizable because oh because he  just doesn't sing i'm like no he loves to really change it up to the point you're like halfway  through the song you're like oh is that what that is this is like a rolling stone oh okay  and then the other thing he does the one time i saw him and i think paul schaefer's band was uh  backing him up this goes way the fuck back rochester days he decided to do a whole concert without 
[01:55:00]  looking at the crowd or acknowledging the crowd what did he just keep his head down kept his head down  kept it to the side had his back to the crowd maybe he's got stage fright i don't know if he was  in a really bad mood or what maybe someone who knows more about music could tell me if that's his  thing but would not acknowledge the crowd and the and the place was going nuts for him well of course  they're all there to see him they don't care what he's singing i want to play the willie nelson i want  to play the willie nelson thing in a break willie we have it all right if we play it now probably some 
[01:55:30]  people turn off the channel yes uh you want to do the denny thing first and then what happened  we read his resignation on the air and then we talk about the uh the comic yes come which is a  great story and jimmy might have a different take on it yes it's not going to be what people think  okay um but uh i remember the dicky goodman bits we did a while back with club soda kenny yeah that type  of a thing why is denny stealing uh kenny's gig hey i i i don't know if denny knew that kenny did 
[01:56:00]  it i think denny was just inspired he denny thinks dicky goodman is hilarious for real i think so  you're not just saying that for the radio no can we ask denny sure you want to get him down here  jim do you want to i think jimmy would appreciate a visit from denny should we talk to denny see what's  going on we didn't talk to denny about the rockstar what is there to say about it you're kind of  right he would have knowledge on the rockstar kids right yeah well i think if you look at um

[01:57:00]  blueberries or something i would say fuck yeah for this fuck yeah he's got his folder permission to  come on board sir permission granted  hey jimmy it was nice meeting your parents the other day yes thank you it was yesterday how'd it go  jimmy it was nice we went out down to um you were stressing a little a little bit about it well i didn't  know what we were gonna do we went to uh the the chelsea market and walked around for a little  while do the high line well yeah we went to the restaurant had some lunch walked on the high line 
[01:57:30]  which was absolutely boring there's nothing up there but then i had to piss and me and my father  both had to shit so we went back to my fucking house and destroyed the bathrooms while my mother sat  on the sofa sounds like a great visit yeah destroyed the nortons are very toilet oriented  people you don't like the high line that bored me to tears wow and then we just watched tv it's just  a good walk but i was so tired because i hadn't slept the night before so we're sitting on my sofa  just talking and watching tv watching a special on it was actually on sirhan sirhan um and enjoy it 
[01:58:00]  wait your parents came all the way from way way down south jersey to watch tv with you well we hung out  outside first but then they just came over and it was like you know what are we gonna do a little  visit i was so tired man i recommend people uh check out the high line if they're in new york city oh i  hate it you did because there's nothing up there how about a fucking a popsicle stand  fucking nothing wow walking but i'm higher than i was before gives a fuck that was awful 
[01:58:30]  utter waste of space and taxpayer dollars he really knows how to simplify things i'm just i'm walking but  it's just not uh but i don't like i don't like a walk unless i'm going somewhere like if i have a  point a point b destination around i do not like just walking for the sake of walking i like a good  wander no i'd rather be in a machine it does something up there like a little store a little  bathroom maybe for a fucking person to piss oh nothing what about the plants they planned some nice  things they did they did it's really cool it's an old railroad obviously it's an old um you know 
[01:59:00]  what do they call them above ground the elevated like an hour or something and then they uh turned  it into a little a very very very narrow walkie uh thing they said uh i i don't know if it's still  that way but there was a hotel right next to it and uh people were going up on there and uh watching  people fuck through the windows oh maybe you could see like yeah people fucking yeah kenny's like yeah  don't give that shit away no this was something that was in the news actually is it over i don't 
[01:59:30]  know they might have had to put up some kind of wall window treatments or something in that hotel  but people would go up there and just watch people and the people in the hotel knew so they'd be  fucking against the windows like hey look we're putting on a show nice exhibitionists i'm a big  fan of looking up you see some things if you look up most people just you know walk and just you know  look like like they do but you should look up man because some shit is going on above your head people  feel like when they're in the city and you're in an apartment or uh or a hotel room or something 
[02:00:00]  you really just feel like it doesn't matter that you're fucking naked and the windows are wide open  all of a sudden it doesn't matter that you're because you're in your own place but everyone  could see i've been i've gotten up in my apartment fucking you know just go to the fridge swinging in  the breeze yeah me too and it doesn't matter it's like who cares if someone and yeah no one has uh  you know curtains blinds no for the most part no new york city apartment most new york city apartments 
[02:00:30]  don't have is this too blue for you denny people are worried here i'm enjoying that you're oh you  this talk is a little you're enjoying it are you talking nudity and whatnot last time i'm on my  computer right okay it's just nudity my windows are all open and i had the fucking laptop open my  lights are off so i went to crank my dick a little so i closed the laptop so the laptop glow wouldn't  give me away and i cranked my pud this is after your parents went home yes this was after yes  cranked my pud no it was all my dad was shitting and my mom was in the kitchen 
[02:01:00]  ah i cranked a quick one out oh my god imagine that put it past you but uh denny yes we're talking  about rock stars and their kids it's tough tough to live up to that like baseball players you know like  they're uh yeah ken griffey jr had a tough time yogi berra's son yeah cal ripkin's dad was a manager  it really wasn't the stars it's you know it's tough to live up to that legacy what do you mean  uh yeah well fucking legged d-e-f-g-r-a because they're always compared to their dad 
[02:01:30]  yogi berra had a kid dale berra that's right oh i sure remember that pirates that's right yeah no one  talks about it look at denny knowing about everything a little bit about everything i think  he had some but the sports kids i'm sorry the the sports guy kids have an easier time than the rock  kids because the sports are more about hard facts and statistics if you can do it you can do it  whereas with music it's so subjective like if you can hit 380 you hit 380 it's not subjective at all 
[02:02:00]  very good point pete rose jr had a son pete pete rose jr played for the long island ducks for a while  yeah he uh he was close to making it a few times it's tough who else was uh but what about rockstar  kids you know you guys are really going over the whole the whole gamut it's it's uh we really don't  stone here i'm trying to think of like i'm trying to help but you're right the country though there  was you look at some decades and then try to find out who like okay from the 60s maybe and then  the 70s who had kids back then was there a uh you know a band fleetwood mac 
[02:02:30]  and big bands the hudson brothers yeah yeah what's her what's her name uh goldie horn's uh  daughter was yeah kate hudson kate hudson her dad is one of the her dad is one of the hudson  brothers yeah but what about the bay city rollers kids they do anything from there nobody  no banana splits no damn city rollers used to always be in teen tiger beat magazine yeah yeah  it'd be like either them or kiss that people liked what about the kids of the association 
[02:03:00]  kids of the association no no how about bread's children bread nobody from bread deep purple  from deep purple richie blackmore wait till melissa athridge and david crosby's baby grows up  how old is that thing now it's got to be and you gotta think it's a thing  a thing she looked like  they had a thing hey graham nash was here yesterday did you see graham nash  yeah gives a fuck at this point that's what i was on the flight with hollies crosby stills nash  does he stills look young looks great looks great he doesn't look great you didn't get my job 
[02:03:30]  that's the best oh boy that's zany melissa athridge is a lesbian what yeah i thought so oh yeah i thought  so okay yeah no they had a kid through the help of medical technology i didn't know that artificial  insemination with uh david crosby's no i heard it was i was norm crosby oh boy let's go back  it was bing crosby bing crosby he came into a wine bottle and kicked it into her vagina angrily 
[02:04:00]  mr sandman  cracks his kid across the forehead he loved beating a kid yeah put that down oh man  that was from my computer what year is that rolling stone cover  it's gonna be 90s because they're trying to figure out how old the the melissa that's april of 94  david crosby thing yeah come on the kid's how old when was that from 94 april of 94. so that's 
[02:04:30]  that's 20 years not what he's lying oh he just made it up he didn't even know that this ever happened  what uh what year is it uh anyone anyone in the right hand corner exactly he just doesn't know what  he's doing jimmy might be close to right i'm 100 right zoom zoom no it can't be that i'll bet  a kiss dude i i remember it being in the 90s last decade oh it's definitely in the 90s yeah  what that he artificially inseminated her yes my sweetie i really want to see you 
[02:05:00]  there you are oh he did you were asking me about that dickie goodman record 98 98 17 years ago 17  years ago 15 years ago that kid's 15 15 years ago 98 yeah but it's the 90s danny don't be a sore  loser how does that kid not have like pictures all over from the paparazzi right i guess they're trying 
[02:05:30]  to put some law in place so that paparazzi can't take pictures of celebrities kids and  shit well that's just stupid something like that makes sense i don't know it does no it doesn't it's  kind of odd when you're out there on the streets though it doesn't make sense because most of these  celebrities set up their own fucking paparazzi shots well that's true right but the ones that  don't yeah you're stepping out of your house and you're just daily used with them flashes going 
[02:06:00]  off i just give them cookies every day they're cool yeah yeah they're fine paparazzi chasing you  around oh like you wouldn't believe oh man wow that's yeah i got it nice and peaceful i guess  you just you just learn to you know live among them yeah it's a part of your life now they love  cookies so does oj uh dicky goodman there danny what happened he was funny no he wasn't goodman and  buchanan back in the in the 50s was the first time around then you had mr jaws mr jaws was so bad 
[02:06:30]  people would request those records all the time why people request novelty records all the time  because they just do people like a good novelty uh and and they do burn fast they do burn fast  people love novelty records and they love and they love uh depressing songs mr jowes  we are here on the beach where a giant shark has just eaten a girl swimmer  a girl swimmer how was it and what did she say when you grabbed her please mr please 
[02:07:00]  i know sharks are stupid but what did you think when you took that first bite  mr jaws before you swim out to sea have you anything else to say  why would he say that i don't know yeah with me now is the local sheriff he ruined the friendship  the shark will be back for lunch what do you intend to do  that doesn't make sense no at least have it make sense and this is like a real thing right yeah like 
[02:07:30]  this is funny what should they do we are going why why why pause  they should be like the answer should make sense yeah what should they do do the hustle  but you do the hustle it's just stupid idea yeah he comes up with a unique concept that could work but  then the answers are stupid they were all songs contemporary songs oh they certainly were  go back well he should have oh so he would have needed a contemporary song for the old so i guess 
[02:08:00]  that's why he you know yeah yeah yeah push uh push playoffs that's so bad will you be able to catch  this giant shark i see that makes sense captain captain captain when you catch one of these sharks  what do you feel like why why excited the shark again he's coming straight for us captain quint is  shouting something at him could this guy sound more jewish too 
[02:08:30]  what happened to dicky goodman oh he shot himself i believe yes did he yeah he he finally had it  didn't we do a bit yes we did we did a whole bit about like i knew what the answer was i just wanted  to hear it again this was just good clean radio fun no yes it is you guys just have to dissect  everything and just you know this stinks it was so hokey hacky and cheesy people like hokey and 
[02:09:00]  hacky yeah they do like that then then go throw the ball around with the ladies oh boy they do like  that we're men in here okay we're men people like that it's terrible guy made a career jaws exactly  can we get to the end of the song back when yeah uh-oh here he comes again  that was the audio from his house  he's coming right onto the boat mr jaws why are you grabbing my hand 
[02:09:30]  but he's not a friend  and he can't talk  did he say why are you holding my hand taking my hand yeah why did he say why did you bite my hand  off right yeah yeah shithead dicky goodman he's stunk um dicky goodman like we need a whole oh 
[02:10:00]  again you could say it's dated but at the time people thought that was funny oh they certainly  did kooky to hear that on the radio like oh yes they're calling the streak i actually like  fucking i will not have ray stevens disparage on this program he made like goofy songs and then he'd be  like uh yeah and then he'd have his real voicey song nice version of misty did he yeah when i when  i was a kid i used to act out that streak song pretend i was singing because it was an audience  laughing behind it i thought he was a rock star no i really did they were laughing i thought i would 
[02:10:30]  picture myself oh god some parts i thought were really cool hello everyone this is your action  news reporter with all the news news across the nation on the scene at the supermarket what parts  did i like i like the pace of this you see what happened yeah i did i stand over by the tomatoes  and here he come running through the pole beans through the fruit get her done  get her done don't look at the open it's too late she'd already been in the scene 
[02:11:00]  oh man denny's laughing what oh it had that sound that's funny right there  by the way kids streaking was uh when you take your clothes off and run around it's not too dated  yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yes they call him the street oh he likes to show off his physique

[02:12:00]  all right we get it it goes on and on and on enough of this fucking dribble god i loved it i want to  i want to stick with the the dicky goodman thing because it's going to lead to denny's uh dicky  goodman bit oh but before that i think we need to play one of uh club soda kenny's uh  rip it off club soda kenny denny you realize that oh that's right club soda kenny did one yeah you 
[02:12:30]  piece of garbage oh you got uh club soda kenny's iraq thumbs up all right uh club soda kenny did a  much better job uh doing dicky goodman than dicky goodman himself hi it's me club soda kenny here on  the gulf coast with the oil spill hey mr oil slick are you killing a lot of fish how are you gonna fix  this mr oil spill what will we need to do that do you like hurricanes mr oil slick do i want i said

[02:14:00]  little bit yeah yeah i think it's obvious to everyone that we need eric dicky goodman's just complete  eric ones that would be eric dicky goodman songs because i know eric's sick of the eric songs so  we should we should change it up a little bit oh my god what do you think guys yeah i'm only one  person here i'm in i'm a hundred percent okay  other people work here too well the south i guess there's a few south songs we might be able to play i 
[02:14:30]  guess denny came to me though and said number one what he just said just now two or in  he believes that uh the true spirit of the bit is to do contemporary songs okay and he just wants  to keep it good clean radio fun okay so we got uh denny yes yes they asked me to help out in this  project and i said i said i'm all in do you know what songs they use yeah i believe they do i believe  i do they gave me some rap songs some hip-hop songs some hip-hop temporary some contemporary

[02:46:00]  wait so you were  i had these weird dreams  when i was on that  michael jackson  i was combative at the airport  and they wouldn't let me into canada  they took me to the emergency room  i don't remember any of this  what did you say  wait wait wait  could i slow you down  you had an inner ear infection  i flew with an inner ear infection  i was taking illegal painkillers  and so i didn't realize how sick i was  how about an illegal fucking penicillin  yeah trish tried to get me to go to the emergency room  and i just wanted to get to the gig  and go to sleep at the hotel  i would have died if i went to sleep  no shit 
[02:46:30]  yeah i had a blood  it was in my blood  and i got bacterial meningitis  and then uh  so i was on that michael jackson  and knocked me out with that  i have no memory  propofol  propofol  how did you get this  do you know how you get it  or  well that was my achilles heel  i used to get earaches during my childhood  like a lot  but i hadn't had one in years  but i thought  when i woke up in jersey  i thought i was shot  encounter  i had this vivid  uh dream  of being shot in a club  by some gangsters  like  like uh  like gangbanger type guys 
[02:47:00]  and i kept asking  the doctors  was i shot  and then when they x-rayed me  at one point  i asked them  if i had any bullets in me  i still thought i was shot  holy fuck  and then i said  did i miss the frank sinatra show  and trish goes  what are you talking about  i said frank sinatra  did a benefit  to get me uh  better didn't he  and she goes  he's been dead  you know that right  i actually had a dream  of sinatra being at the club  you were like tony soprano  when he was fucking  laying in the hospital  the dreams were weird  and and i also dreamt  that i was on this  this train 
[02:47:30]  i i knew that i was laying down  and i wasn't like  sitting up  i had you know  i was aware of that  but i was on this train  that was uh  that was like going somewhere  and there were like  these uh rodeo clowns  were jumping off this train  and they were being sprayed  by a hose  and like falling off the train  and running across this field  very weird  what weirdness  how disappointing is it  to think sinatra did a benefit  and then you wake up  and realize it was levy  that's great 
[02:48:00]  that's great  it was fucked up  so you don't remember  eight days  i don't remember anything  in canada at all  they got a private plane  for me to come back  and all that  what were you doing  in the airport  did she say  how were you being combative  like with the customs people  well first i threw up  in line at newark  i just suddenly ralphed  and everybody scattered  and then instead of like  uh checking me out  or something  they took me to the head  of the line  so i can get through security  get them get them  through faster  yeah yeah  they just put me  on the plane  and uh  i i just became combative 
[02:48:30]  at uh customs  i don't remember  what i did or anything  just probably obnoxious  so wait i thought  they wouldn't let you  into canada  um no they  they wouldn't let me  just wander the streets  they uh red flagged me  and took me to the  emergency room  and then i  i was  took like four guys  to hold me down  and they just put that  propofol down my throat  holy shit  i don't remember that  part either  i was reeling  with this earache  i was  i don't know  yeah you must have had  like fucking  poisoned blood 
[02:49:00]  sickly  i hadn't been inside  of a hospital  since i was like 13  so it was weird  right right  and then when i woke up  there was all these guys  with masks and gowns  i thought i was dying  for sure  holy shit  my sister was there  my brother came in  from philadelphia  so you're like  yeah  they don't just show up  my sister looked  the look on her face  was like i had already  died  and uh  i didn't want to go to  sleep because i didn't  think i was going to  wake up  fuck  and they were giving me  all this um xanax  you know nothing would  work  i was up for  oh and also i couldn't  hear anybody  it was like i was 
[02:49:30]  underwater  that kind of  deafness  but that went away  my hearing is actually  better now  really  since the illness  yeah the only thing  was i had a  like uh  my legs were like  jello when i  when i  you know  because when you  don't move for eight  days  your muscles turn  to fucking guacamole  it only takes eight  days  yeah  oh yeah  that's unbelievable  an olympic athlete  would have been the  same  you stand up  and you  it's like a  newborn giraffe  you just pitch  forward  you know  so they had to  like  they had to watch  me like step in  and out of a tub 
[02:50:00]  before they let me  go home  they had to know  that i could walk  around the apartment  without like killing  myself and stuff  like that  isn't that ironic  you had fucking  legs like george  that's true  yeah  flopping around  cloth puppet legs  would be more useful  yeah  it's fucked up though  cloth puppet legs  yeah  how many days  were you in the  hospital auto  what did they do  no how many days  damn  i was in the jersey  shore hospital  for about four  or five days  and then they  moved me to this 
[02:50:30]  rehabilitation place  in red bank  the guy in the  in the bed next  to me  uh had  um turned  a motorcycle  over it  like it took  down like 50 feet  of a fence  every bone in his  body was shattered  and they were  giving him  sorry  they were giving  him like the  best drugs  like oxycontin  and all that  because he was  he had broken  bones  and i was  and trish told  everybody that  i had a propensity  for drug abuse  and whatnot  and i couldn't  get anything  you know  they were just  giving me like  advil 
[02:51:00]  and my  the headache  was unbearable  fuck that  give me morphine  unbearable  yeah the one time  i actually needed  painkillers  they wouldn't  give them to me  yeah yeah  yeah it was  pretty ugly  damn  um but like i said  i was never sick  before and it was  just it just  came out of nowhere  and they don't know  exactly how you  get that stuff  it's like  didn't that like  kill jerry red  wilson or was  his the other  meningitis  yeah he got that  in hawaii yeah  he was dead  before he got  back to la i think  yeah yeah he was  a comic i don't  know if you guys  remember jerry  i know the name  yeah he was he was  he was arising  and he got a  meningitis and on  the flight i think 
[02:51:30]  they said he  shouldn't have  flown yeah  and his girlfriend  said he woke up  during the flight  and started making  no sense and  we're babbling  and then just i  guess he used to  play at fast eddies  a lot of me  yeah he was a  good guy  um no they said  one in four people  die from what i had  but fuck it  i got lucky  but i don't see  like a new world  like i didn't gain  that wisdom from  a brush with death  it's just i feel  like i'm gonna go  through this again  and it'll fucking  do me in next time  like i live to die  another day like  that right  like cynical about 
[02:52:00]  it some people say  that you're not  scared to die after  you go through  something like that  well if you see  a white light maybe  yeah yeah  maybe you get a  hint of what's next  that's for sure  hospitals suck  they don't give a  fuck about you  there they really  don't it's a  business  it's their business  you're just a  number man  they're watching  saturday night live  and you're screaming  and hitting the button  and they're watching  a bad sketch on  snl  i don't mean to laugh  all the fuck  they don't give a  fuck  but you're  100% right  yeah  they don't give a  fuck 
[02:52:30]  they're just annoyed  that you're screaming  yeah  what about that weird  moment though when  you're walking by  when you're walking  and the nurse said  otto have you been  giving your medication  to jim  yeah  it's wrong to want  to be alone  yeah i'm not going  to use otto's head  yeah florentine came  and saw me a lot  yeah  yeah i couldn't get  rid of that guy  he was like three  times  yeah i didn't know  he liked me that  much it was really  nice of him  that's cool  do you know  who this man is  this is otto  men are coming  here to kill him  yeah  jim just stood 
[02:53:00]  there with his  hands shaking  trying to light a  cigarette in the  front  after they threw  his flowers out  that fruit  yes  fucking atrocious  food they give you  fucking can't taste  anything  the eggs sucked  it's horrible  man  you must appreciate  food more now  that you're at  like better food  that you have to  eat that garbage  yeah just appreciate  you know  you know  being home  and not being  or you know  fucking talking  to doctors  ask me the same  they kept asking  me questions  like do you know  what state you're in  do you know  who the president is  they wanted to see  how fucked up I was  yeah yeah 
[02:53:30]  you know  holy shit  how long were you  in rehab  that was like  seven days  I got  the nurse was  really cool  she goes  you're the  healthiest one  here  you're gonna  I'm gonna get  you out of here  quickly  because there were  people there  that were just  dying like  stroke victims  and shit  you recovered  very well  I mean  I know that  can be a  fucking disastrous  end result  but you recovered  so the whole thing  was about what  three weeks  yeah probably  probably the better  part of a month  June was just  a blur  you know  and then when  they did the benefit  for me  I was like  really healthy 
[02:54:00]  it felt fraudulent  you know  it felt fraudulent  but that's because  the hospital bills  didn't start coming  in yet  you know  now it comes in  definitely handy  you know  Jesus Christ  all from a fucking  ear infection  yeah  I found out  I had terminal  cancer  and to make  the co-payments  I started selling  crystal meth  to teenagers  it's wacky  well we're absolutely 
[02:54:30]  glad you're alright  oh man  answer the cards  and letters  and Otto by the way  will be performing  this Saturday  at 8.30  at the comedy shop  in Parsippany  New Jersey  which is a very local gig  bigger and better  than ever  here the new  here's how you sell it  here the new  improved Otto  oh yeah  no more potty talk  no more potty talk  I know right  there's nothing there  there's no more  chunk chunk  chunk chunk  chunk chunk  whoosh I was covered  in gas  shit wow

[02:56:30]  to be annoyed  having some girl  pawing you're trying  to get 20 bucks  it's just one of the  owners sensibility  he likes variety  he goes  I'm trying to bring  like a french  vegas  like you know  Cirque du Soleil  and that bullshit  good  but I mean  like Abbott and Costello  started in burlesque  burlesque was  the girl could not  show her nipple  there would have to be  a covering  a tassel  and then some  baggy pants comic  and that was  what burlesque was  baggy pants comic  yeah  that's what they  were I guess  back then  yeah yeah yeah  how did they  how did they  get laughs back then 
[02:57:00]  they couldn't curse  or it had to be clean  well they knew  they were going to  see a knife throwing  act then a comedian  then a dancer  twirling tassels  it wasn't too smudgy  it was expected  yeah  that old school comedy  was different  yeah yeah  there wasn't  no dirty talk  no  Abbott and Costello  always worked clean  even though you were  allowed to be blue  in burlesque  yeah  yeah  who were some of  the people that  came out of that  you know I guess  March Blue Bruce  Red Fox  Little Lonnie Bruce  no I don't think  Lenny was more  in jazz rooms 
[02:57:30]  and stuff  he did a few  strip joints  oh yeah I'm sure  he did  but he was like  the old  you're thinking  Vaudeville burlesque  right  well Vaudeville  was everything  but there was  a lady named  Belle Barth  that was real dirty  I think there's  some albums  of her somewhere  Kump  yeah  but Lou Custeau  had the sense  he knew  if he wanted  a career  just you know  work clean  even though  it won't be  fun  TV will come  calling  or something  movies  yeah  yeah  and if your wife  wants to get a pool  cemented 
[02:58:00]  oh god  oh god  that's horrible  oh my god  that is terrible  yeah for an Italian male  to lose his firstborn son  they said he was never  enjoyed a moment of life  after that  really that was it  huh  just took the joy  out of his life  he was just a robot  after that  and that happened  pretty early  in there  in his life  I saw him talk about that  in an interview  like they actually asked him  it was like back in the days  when they didn't fucking  when they would ask  a celebrity a question  wow  and this is your life  or whatever  he talked about it  what did he say  I don't remember  but he kind of gave the account 
[02:58:30]  and he was unemotional  about it  like you could see  it was just  you know  I heard they could have  saved him  if he wasn't yelling  going  call the  please call me  my kid's in the  call the  yeah  what about stinky  oh  that's funny shit  so bad  wow  there was a lot of that  tragic old Hollywood shit  well he was from  Patterson  New Jersey 
[02:59:00]  and a swimming pool  was a symbol of  he's made it  and then his fucking kid  it was like a year old  just crawled in there  and the wife was like  putting a bottle of gin  in a potted plant  and hiding it  she was like a sneak drinker  and shit  they stayed married too  because they were  old school Catholics  but there was a lot of blame  oh there must have been  a hell of a fucking marriage  after that  oh my god  yeah he's just blaming her  for fucking not being there  yeah  and no safety  with a child  in a pool back 
[02:59:30]  you know the code  to have a fence  it only started like  five years ago  you don't watch  that shit out  five years ago  ten maybe  did he ever have  any other kids  sink like stones  did I what  did he have  did he have any other kids  yeah oh yeah  he had daughters  his daughter  he has two daughters  me and Voss inducted them  Abbot Costello  to the New Jersey  Hall of Fame  so I met his daughters  you're kidding  Abbot too  Abbot Costello  as a team  yeah yeah  a little homely  the daughters  I don't remember actually 
[03:00:00]  they couldn't be  that young at that point  I don't remember them being knockouts  but I really don't remember  well they gotta be really old  sink like stones  they do  I love those guys  more and more  when I watch them now  yeah  brilliant timing  yeah  fucking great  and Abbot was such a nasty prick  cracking him in the face  with a heavy pinky ring  for years and years  he really was a fuck  yeah  smacking  a smack across the face  is very  really gets you angry  after two or three times 
[03:00:30]  if you just do that  to yourself  and he wouldn't even  give him a chance  he'd walk right up  and smack him  there's 35 years of that shit  wow  and Costello  was a golden gloves boxer  he was as tough  as John Gotti  was he really  oh yeah  at one time  I saw him  punch Abbot  on an old  like kinescope  with Milton Berle  like he gave him  just one too many  and I saw him  punch him  right in the upper arm  here with the bone  and the flesh  separate  and you saw  the blood drain  out of Abbott's face  it looked like 
[03:01:00]  it could fucking hurt  I mean Costello  had a hand  the size of a microwave oven  and I swear  the fuck sucker  had no fucking arm there  he finally got him back  yeah  he just had enough  you never would have thought  he was a tough guy  very tough  he was as tough  as any mafioso  he was just a comedian  wow  very tough  yeah  because in every  every movie and stuff  he's got fucking  you know  hat in his hands  and rolling the brim  of the hat  yeah  well yeah  he's playing a five year old child  you know  I believed he was five  when him and Stinky 
[03:01:30]  would interact  I thought they were  two five year olds  fucking brilliant  yeah yeah  all pissed at each other  over dumb shit  yeah  god that was  just a weird time  that that was  that was actually  entertaining  I mean it is now  to watch  but there's also  a nostalgia part of it now  but that was just  that was what they went to  it holds up  it does  it does  a lot of that shit  holds up  their movies  was too much  of a subplot  there'd be some  romantic subplot  and too much  singing with the  Andrew system  yes  but the TV show  boiled all that shit  down 
[03:02:00]  to just their comedy  for a half hour  you ever seen  the three stooges  yeah  awesome too  yeah  they said  Lou got a lot of his shit  from watching Curly  a lot of his  oh really  high pitched voice  and a lot of his  mannerisms  but I think  they're both geniuses  fucking great  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  it's strange  that  do you enjoy  Curly Joe  no no  Joe Besser  Joe Besser  I disliked more  than Curly Joe  because he wouldn't  let Mo slap him a lot  oh I thought they're  the same person  oh no  that was  yeah yeah  Joe Besser was stinky 
[03:02:30]  and he took over  for Shemp  but he like said  Larry could never  slap me  and Mo  could only slap me  three times per short  he had some  fucking rule like that  it's like  play ball  wasn't he the  I'm gonna give you  such a pinch  yeah  I'll harm you  you hated him  I loved him as stinky  but I didn't think  he was  he wasn't on board  to be in the studio  he had to get slapped  every five seconds  and then there was  Curly Joe  Curly Joe was just like  a fat boring curly 
[03:03:00]  look alike  yeah yeah  he had nothing  didn't work at all  but he was tiny  they were tiny guys  they were all like  5'1  they were really short  the guy who played  Curly in that movie  looked like a linebacker  he was way too  fucking big  oh in the movie  yeah what's his name  he's on vinyl  all the time  oh yeah  Will Sasso  Will Sasso  he did fine  imitating him  but he's just not the right  that was a better movie  than I thought it would be  though  it really was funnier  than I thought  the thing I liked about it  was that they broke it up  so it looked like  you were watching  three Stooges shorts  yeah yeah yeah  that was a good idea 
[03:03:30]  that they did that  that was good  the guy that did Larry  was really good too  yeah he was a great Larry  he was awesome  good job  sounded like him  but I was just ashamed  to go see it in a theater  because  but why watch this  you could just watch  the original  watch the boys  you know  those movies still exist  yeah  on DVD  they look great  hold hands  you lovebirds  oh yeah  one of my favorite moments  is when Shemp  is on a ladder  and I forget  with it's Mo  and he's handing him  like a fucking  like a  or something  a wallpaper hang  that looks like a broom  or whatever 
[03:04:00]  yeah  and I don't know  why he did it  but he took it  and he just fucking  jammed it up  into his face  oh it's like  right under his fucking nose  like just a horrible  you know that was an improv  yeah  I'm sure they said  fuck you  and they must have  they must have  hit each other  sometimes  with those things  like accidentally  did you ever see  the one where  it's Curly  it's a Shemp  it's a Shemp  but Curly is in it  with longer hair  oh shit  post stroke Curly  oh I heard about that  they're on a train  and Curly  Curly's sleeping  under a derby 
[03:04:30]  and they wake him up  and it's the only time  the three brothers  appeared together  wow  so it's a Shemp  and it's called  hold that lion  and you get to see Curly  with his hair grown in  but he's thin and sick  is it supposed to be him  or are you supposed to  you're not supposed to know  it's him  well he's supposed to be  a man sleeping on a train  but he does one  like curly moment  he does like  one of those arm things  yeah  oh god that is sad  like a wink to the audience  what did he die of  he had many strokes  and he died at 52  wow  Jesus 
[03:05:00]  but he spent like  the last 10 years  just sitting in a chair  you know  it was fucking sad  all those smacks  to the fucking head  I don't know  no probably bad diet  oh of course  probably lived on pastrami  and bourbon  they didn't do that shit  back then  you know  watch it down with cigarettes  yeah  pastrami  surprised you dropped dead  at that age  they didn't know  they didn't know back then  that's like what happened  if like Fred Mertz  he just dropped  on fucking  Hollywood Boulevard  Hollywood Boulevard  yeah yeah  outside a movie premiere 
[03:05:30]  yeah yeah  he did  you gotta take the death tour  when you go to LA  it's the best  hey Rick  they actually point  and show you where he died  Ted's was good to him though  he was unhirable  because he was a bad alcoholic  and Ted's he said  I'll give you the job  but you can't fuck it up  you know  he gave him a chance  what was he  pals with him before  or something  he probably knew him  from a lot of movies  yeah yeah  150 movies  who was  William Ferole  yeah William Ferole  he was one of those guys  that was always in shit  Miracle on 34th Street  that movie 
[03:06:00]  fucking stunk  what  you did  you hated that  hated that bad acting  really  I don't know  is Santa gonna be there  oh  it's fucking shit  wait who's that  the janitor  that becomes friends  with Chris Kringle  all of them  it was just  Chris Kringle  but that was the style  back then  I know  but it ended badly  with them dumping the letters  and I hated that movie  I hated it  yeah Chris Kringle  was a fucking shit  it was so full of hope  right  yeah but fake hope  it didn't make me feel anything  I was just like  oh fuck all these people  who changed the acting  you think  Brando was a big part of it  you think it was Brando 
[03:06:30]  that really changed it  to how we know it today  in the public view  because when the movies first started  they came from all the Broadway  fucking stages  so they  they just acted differently  well John Garfield  they said  is a link to that  anti-hero stuff  he played a lot of  like dislikable guys  but you liked them anyway  Widmark too  seemed to act a little bit differently  Richard Widmark  in the 40s  didn't seem to act  like the rest of them did  that over the top acting  yeah that Yuta  was a real psychopath  it didn't feel like  like the rest of the people  in Kiss of Death  were like  I wanna just stow it 
[03:07:00]  Tommy  a lot of that bad acting  you're talking about  had to do with  the microphones back then  really sucked  especially in the early 30s  you know  the tape recorder  was the size of  like a truck  you know  like a mail truck  so you had to speak loud  walk into a room  and really dump it out there  and not knowing  how to go from stage  to film  yeah  it's a lot  stage acting  is a lot smaller  ah  yeah  no they knew  they thought that's  how you do it  that's how you do it  there's a lot more  subtleties 
[03:07:30]  we're just putting this  on film instead of  you know  on film  yeah a lot more  subtleties  film stars are weird  they always have  a big head  and a small body  yes  the big stars  are always like that  big head  fucking  we had a guy  Mike Shannon  in yesterday  Michael Shannon  his head was giant  he was a very intense guy  yeah  is that the guy  from  Warwick Empire  and fucking  he played  Iceman  what was he like  great  he was funny  but real deadpan  a very intense guy  very intense looking  he was like the Iceman guy  he is  oh yeah 
[03:08:00]  he wasn't acting  he wasn't acting much  for that role  he's fucking brutal  he's that guy  but he had a very dry  sense of humor  and it was pretty fun  I haven't seen any of my  photos yet  because Iraq's hogging them  he was funny  oh you got pictures  with him  and he sounded like  Stephen Wright  a lot of people  pointed that out  the budget on  Boardwalk Empire  just for costumes  must be 3 million a week  there he is  it's the detail of that  there he is  he's a crazy looking  that's him trying to smile  he is crazy  three of us in the picture  he looks like Jaws  yeah I was gonna say  he looks like Jaws  he was like one twisted 
[03:08:30]  chromosome away from  giantism  yeah  yeah  that's a weird dude  oh man  he was intense  he was intense  he was intense  he was intense  he was intense  Kuklinski  did you see it?  I didn't see it  yeah I saw it  that guy was a mountain  of a man  you know  yeah  yeah yeah yeah  and what a fucking  just savage  fuck sucker  I think he exaggerated  his kill  I think so too  because that's all he had  at the end  was how  like I want to be  the toughest guy  in history  you know  yeah yeah  but he was  I mean he was  he was doing that  poisoning people 
[03:09:00]  and just  the blatant fucking  hacking people up  he opened up a fucking  hat shop  and he planted bombs  in the hats  yeah so people  would put the hat on  and two hours later  the bomb would go off  that happened  it was with the  ice cream man guy  that they would go around  and they'd kill people  then freeze them  they'd put them  in fucking freezers  for like two years  yeah  and then two years later  they'd take them  out of the freezer  dump them really  fucking far away  and they'd find them  but it was like  they wouldn't know 
[03:09:30]  they wouldn't know  when he died  or shit like that  so it'd fuck the entire  any kind of case  they were trying to build  against anyway  so smart  it's great  so smart  put them on ice  for two fucking years  they found like ice  chips in the guy's heart  they go what the fuck  is this  ice in this dead body  someone they found  a little too soon  after they dumped him  and that's kind of  how they figured  like alright  this guy was killed  a while ago  and put two and three together  they got him talking  on tape  about killing people  and then how can you  argue with that  but I hate him more  than like Dahmer  and those guys 
[03:10:00]  because they were  insane  crazy  he was just a fucking  evil prick  what a bad guy  yeah what an evil guy  and then trying to just  you know  lead his little family life  he has his kids  and his wife  and then he'd go out  and just commit  brutality on people  and then the way  he just kind of  brags about it  on those interviews  that one mob boss  he was working for  he drove him to Manhattan  and they saw an old man  walking his dog  and he just goes  cap that guy  and he just walked up  and shot him  and he never knew  if that was somebody 
[03:10:30]  he was mad at  or just some poor schmuck  walking his dog  just that yeah  Roy DeMeo  Roy DeMeo made him do that  yeah  he goes he's one of us  ugh  that's Keith the Cop's uncle  fucking people  Keith the Cop's uncle  was Roy DeMeo  yeah  really  oh yeah  oh shit  yesterday we were  looking at a picture  of him and going  holy shit  it looks just like  it looks like Keith  wow that's frightening  it was frightening  is he like a scary guy  you think  I mean do you see  signs of a temper  well good thing  he became a cop 
[03:11:00]  he could take it out  on the fucking  scales of Manhattan  oh my god  the scales  yeah yeah  you know getting back  to Costello for a second  someone just tweeted me  he won 32 fights  before he got knocked out  yeah  really  he was the real fucking deal  can you see  pictures of Costello  did he just run around  the ring  and have the guy chase him  is there  nah he was boxing  there's no footage  of him boxing  is there  probably not  no they wouldn't  film anything  didn't he use like  an Irish name  like Lou Christie  or something like  I don't know  oh there's a new 
[03:11:30]  Costello that boxes  look at this  fucking guy  holy shit  that guy  looks like the  Frito Bandito  yeah  then  and this shit  from movies  yeah  but no real  real pictures  any old photos  of any of his shape  sick gambler  too  all those guys  oh all those guys  they would play  like $50,000  hands of poker  between shooting scenes  wow  yeah  they were degenerates  yeah  must have been 
[03:12:00]  quite the life  back then  you know  no fucking  cameras all around  you could be  as much of a  degenerate as you want  without worrying  about some fan  with a fucking phone  in your face  that's true  yeah  when did he die  Costello  and Abbott  Abbott was in the 70s  yeah Abbott died late  but yeah  but he like  he died broke  he had to live  in his sister's attic  and shit  get the fuck out of here  Costello at least  you know  dropped dead  before the government  took everything  from him  wow  wow you know  your shit Otto  yeah  you really know  your history  yeah 
[03:12:30]  these old bastards  I love  these old bastards  yeah  what year was Costello  died  he died in the 60s  he died I think  in like 58  or something like that  before this atrocious  last movie came out  called the 30 foot bride  of candy rock  it was without Abbott  really  it was just Costello  yeah  it tanked  why was it bad  because there was no Abbott  there was no balance there  it was just a fat guy  running around  you know  married to this giant  giant woman  cheap special effects  it sounds so bad

[03:29:00]  Live  Here's your host, Sam Roberts  Yes  Otto is hanging out  Hi  Hi  It's after O.P. and Anthony Live  866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number  And we were talking  I was thinking  when you were talking about  waking up in the hospital  and eight days had passed  So you didn't know where you were  when you woke up  No, no  And just, you know  a bunch of doctors 
[03:29:30]  you know, staring at me  and I was  kind of deaf  You know, I couldn't hear  what they were questioning me  Because you had an ear infection  that turned into  spinal meningitis  Is that right?  Bacterial meningitis  I don't even know what that is  but I had fluid on my brain  Yeah  And was that like  was that as a result  of the ear infection  or was the ear infection a symptom?  Not treating the ear infection  Because you were just  popping pills instead?  Yeah, I was masking the pain  It was probably  with me for a while  I was popping illegal 
[03:30:00]  painkillers  Yeah  That I got from a wrestler  that I know  You don't want to tell me  which wrestler  No, I can't  You can tell me off the air though?  Yeah, I could  Okay, alright  Because I'm curious about that  But  it made me think  because  I had an uncle  who had a  I don't know  I never really knew  what happened to him  but he drove  from Kentucky  to Jersey  Right  To work  No, Philly  He was in Philly  to work like an art trade 
[03:30:30]  like he makes like sculptures  and he was working a trade show  Okay  And while he's there  he drives all the way  it's like probably  I don't know  13 hours at least  And he's an older guy  Right  And so  he kind of  I think he collapsed  like he started  he did what  I think you or  somebody said  where he's making no sense  Oh yeah  You know what I mean  and everybody's going  what's going on  and he kind of collapsed  And he ended up  in the hospital  and he was there  for like a week and a half  with them trying to figure out  what went wrong  and everything  Right  But he was saying  that like  being at the hospital 
[03:31:00]  or whatever  just really fucks  with your brain  He was saying that  he thought he was in  Nashville  Oh  And so  they'd go  what state are you in?  He'd go Tennessee  I'm in Nashville  I know where I am  And they were like  no you're in Pennsylvania  You're in Philadelphia  and he thought  that this was  some kind of thing  against him  because he wasn't  thinking straight  Oh  And so he said  he said he got  to the point  where and he was like  they're keeping me here  until I play their game  Oh  He said he got  to the point  where they were coming in  and saying 
[03:31:30]  do you know  where you are  and he was saying  Philadelphia  because in his head  he goes  I know I'm in Nashville  but I'm going to lie  and say I'm in Philadelphia  so these people  will let me out  Oh  that's cool  So what was  what was his thing?  I don't know  I don't know exactly  what went wrong  I don't know  if they know  I think he was  it was dehydrating  and exhaustion  and then  And a broken GPS  probably right?  Yeah  The fuck am I?  And uh  and yeah  and just being  and then once he was  in the hospital  just being out 
[03:32:00]  for so long  Yeah  I guess like you were saying  like you wake up  eight days later  and your body's like  it's not used to moving  Yeah  Your muscles have broken down  Well you always hear  rock guys say  you know like  they don't know  what city they're in  and when they wake up  it's like where am I  but it wasn't like that  you know what I mean  No  It wasn't  It was a brain injury  you know  Yeah  But was it weird  to lose that kind  of chunk of time?  That freaks me out  like knowing that  the people around you  have just lived  for eight days  Yeah  It's scary to be 
[03:32:30]  incapacitated  but you know  Trish was there  and my brother Tom  flew up  and Trish's mom Patty  was there  and so they  they saved my life  I think  getting me the best care  but it's scary  you know  you're just out  they could fucking  put their cock  in your mouth  for eight days  you don't know  what's going on  you know  But as long as you wake up  you'll take the cock  right?  I'll take the cock  yeah  to get out of the hospital  but uh  yeah  they shipped  my pup at home  George  you know  a very expensive doll  he was shipped home  um 
[03:33:00]  yeah  it was weird  and the dreams  that Michael Jackson  drug propofol  they say  causes a lot of  sexual dreams  for people  Really?  and uh  and that's why  a lot of women  think they were  raped by their doctor  but I didn't have  any dreams like that  I just dreamt  that I was shot  Yeah  I was on a train  watching rodeo clowns  leap off the train  and run into like  a stadium  people were cheering  and they were  being sprayed  with hoses  very  very vivid  I  I can picture it 
[03:33:30]  Maybe you're just  more of a bizarre  violent man  than a sexual man  Oh  you know  you think so  Maybe that's just  yeah  that's the pieces  of your brain  that propofol  opened up  all the  sort of  just weirdness  but the getting  shot in a nightclub  thing  that was like  a feature film  length dream  you know  it all started  with a dog  I was in this  nightclub  and a dog  jumped on my lap  and I started  petting him  and these gangsters  that owned the club  were angry  that they thought  I was having  too much fun  with the dog  and they wanted  to shoot me  and they did  because they didn't 
[03:34:00]  like you playing  with the dog  yeah  it's not much  of a plot  is it  no  it sounds like  I wrote this  stupid movie  that's fine  yeah  because you wake  up from your dream  thinking  that was brilliant  you start writing  things down  and you go  they shot me  because I was  playing with a dog  but yeah  but a week later  I still thought  I was shot  when I woke up  in Jersey  it was very  very weird  how long did it  take for you  to like  separate  from that  dream world  into reality  and know  that all that  stuff was  completely made up  like did you  pretty quick  realize that  I wasn't 
[03:34:30]  shot  there's no  bullet holes  in me  well when I  saw myself  without my shirt  on there was  still a lot  of dings  they were giving  me needles  in my stomach  to stop  blood from  clotting  and there was  they put a  nicotine patch  on me  and this and  that  so it still  looked like  there might be  a bullet hole  that they're not  telling me about  it was fucking  weird  did you get paranoid  like that  like you were like  they're not telling  me the whole story  well um for about  24 hours I was  sure I was dying  you know what  am I doing  here in this  hospital and  why are all  these people 
[03:35:00]  covered with  biohazard suits  from like a  science fiction  movie  yeah  even my brother  my brother wore  a mask  and then my  brother my brother  Tom has got a  real exact mind  he he read  an art he gave  me a um a  choice of three  articles from  some newspaper  had and he  read me an  entire article  and then and  questioned me  about it  and I thought  he I thought  he was trying  to like fight  my boredom  but he was  really trying  to see how  fucked up I  was he goes 
[03:35:30]  oh Ottawa  so what was  that article  about I  thought he was  like oh he  was testing  short-term  memory and  yeah but you  know that you  know that's  just the way  my brother is  he's got a  real exact mind  like that and  he was probably  wanted to make  sure I was okay  he wasn't just  making conversation  yeah yeah  but he would  that's something  he would do  when you're  not sick  in real life  just if you're  just coming over  he would check  your brain  no just read  an article  that he found  interesting or  take you on a  hike like you  just let's go  hiking now I  have this day 
[03:36:00]  planned you know  what does he do  my brother he's  an environmental  engineer he he  checks out  businesses to  make sure they're  not putting too  much pollution in  the air or the  water is that  something he  always wanted to  do I don't  know how he got  into that it  doesn't sound  very much fun  no is he is  he is he an  environmentalist  like is he an  environmental guy  he's like Mike  Stivick on all in  the family he used  to pick it  oh he did  yeah you know  very pro black  against death  but he's very  liberal hippie  hippie types  he's a good 
[03:36:30]  person  did everybody in  your family just  kind of follow  whatever they were  passionate about  no my whole  family is fear  based I'm the  only one with  any balls to  try a job that  might be fun or  interesting  so even though  he's like in his  heart he's like a  picketing hippie he  needs something with  some structure  well sure I  mean he has  children and a  wife you know he  needs to put food  on the table but  you know he's a  good guy my  brother just  different than me  he went to  Cornell for like  he went to  school forever  he was always in  school like my  entire life even 
[03:37:00]  when I was growing  up he was still  in fucking college  is he happy  yeah he seems  happy  all right so  then you know  yeah he's good  that's fine then  so you when you  came in you  immediately started  doing Breaking  Bad impressions  today here  yeah yeah yeah  oh yeah  which I was  psyched about  because I  literally I don't  know how I did  it either  yeah but I  Monday right  I finished I  finally caught up  like I haven't  been caught up  with Breaking  Bad at all  like I've never  watched the show  it's great when  it's live and I 
[03:37:30]  managed to catch  all the way up  with no spoilers  okay so I'm  there like I'm  there that's that's  so cool did you  do that on Netflix  I did I had to do  the first the first  bunch on Netflix  yeah and then I  DVR'd this season  as it was happening  while I watched  last season oh  yeah just marathon  my way through it  I don't know what  I would do if I  had to sit through  those cliffhangers  that they put on  that show yeah like  if I actually had to  sit there and wait  a year to go from  season to season yeah 
[03:38:00]  I would want to  blow my brains out  I know I almost  wanted to not watch  anything and just  tape them all and  just watch it in one  day that's how I I  was aware of the show  for years but I  caught up I did like a  marathon two weekends  and just watched  every fucking episode  in a row and it was  great it's amazing it  wasn't at all like  homework it was  brilliant and very  entertaining and I've  never seen a show  like have the balls to  completely deconstruct  itself yeah you know  what I mean like they  know that this is the  last season they're not  doing anything else  after this they're not 
[03:38:30]  doing I mean they're  doing the prequel with  better call Saul okay  did you hear about that  I did I'm against it  because he's good in a  small burst you know  come in do your 5-10  minute scene I don't  know I just don't  think it's gonna be  too comical I don't  know it's you're not  gonna have he's not  gonna be interacting  with Walter White or  Jesse and those are  the characters you want  to see who are these  new fucking actors and  you know it's like when  they spun off what's  his name from Mary  Tyler Moore and the  boss Lou Grant and 
[03:39:00]  they gave him a show  but it was a dramatic  series and Lou Grant  was a comedic character  yeah fucking it's  didn't make it  horrible right so  but when but they're  not trying to do like  a movie after this  they're not trying to  make sure they have a  little something like  they are destroying  the world that this  show exists in yeah  like throughout this  last season crazy and  it's incredible yeah  what do you think is  gonna happen at the  end my my guess was  that that Walter and  and Hank would would  both die and that 
[03:39:30]  Jesse would somehow  survive because he  seems to be like the  only one with the soul  left he's got some  kind of moral compass  yeah he feels horrible  about everything he's  throwing his money out  he feels like shit  about everything he's  done and he's felt  that way kind of the  whole series yeah like  he always does some  dumb shit and then  feels terrible yeah  the other the other  thought I had was that  Walter White might go  back to just being a  high school teacher and  get away with  everything and then  and then they would  show like his  classroom and just  show a really hard 
[03:40:00]  looking like drug  cartel type face you  know sitting in the  back of the room  that's there to kill  him and you know  that'd be cool yeah  like somebody from the  past came back to  murder him after he  thought that everything  was okay he got away  with it he started a  new life that'd be  badass yeah I don't  know I mean he's  dying of cancer but  you know I think  they're gonna give you  what the Sopranos  didn't give you like  go out in with a  machine gun you know  killing everybody and  stuff like that yeah  I mean I think there's  gonna be a definitive 
[03:40:30]  end to this show  because like when in  the Sopranos when  Tony got that machine  gun from Bobby  Bacala on his  birthday I thought  that was definitely  gonna be used towards  the end you know  there'd be a big  Scarface shootout  but they kind of  cheated you on that  and you're gonna  wait maybe that's  what they'll do on  Breaking Bad I'm  kind of waiting for  just a massive shootout  yeah at the end of  this show I'd be  happy yeah if there  was just a massive  shootout yeah and  we find there's got  Jesse or there's one  guy left standing  yeah but the real  dramatic stuff on that 
[03:41:00]  show is when you  know when there's a  fight when it's it's  it's verbal not you  know the violent the  the body count is good  on the show and you  know the violence is  nice and graphic but  the you know the  dramatic scenes is  like when when his  wife pulled the knife  on him and shit like  that it's like oh  man you just feel for  Walter White you know  yeah that's why it was  weird that they gave  uh Jeff Daniels the  Emmy for best actor  on a TV series yeah  have you seen Newsroom  on HBO yeah I  watched a bit of it  yeah I mean it's a  good show I watch it 
[03:41:30]  but I was I was I  was shocked yeah that  you know as much as  everybody loves  Breaking Bad that they  didn't give Bryan  Cranston the Emmy  yeah has he ever  gotten an Emmy uh I  don't know what's up  Eric yeah I wanted to  ask Otto a question uh  when you said he was  doing the impression he  came in about how bad  a liar he is yes  family the scene where  things are really  getting heated in his  house yeah and him  and Skylar are um  fighting over the  knife yeah right how  bad did you want that  knife to fly out and  like hit the kid  I wasn't thinking 
[03:42:00]  about that yeah you  are an evil human being  Eric I hate that son  you don't know because  he's because he's just  he has no concept of  anything not that he  did know what was  going on but just real  life around him at all  yeah and he's  obnoxious about it  why aren't you dead  like he's stuck up for  no reason yeah oh  stuck up he's stuck up  oh there's plenty of  times where remember  when they bought him  the car yeah and  then uh when he was  gonna go out with his  friends he thinks he's  like hot shit for no  reason he has nothing 
[03:42:30]  yeah and he's just  obnoxious he's a  teenager Steely Dan  that's a good band  my son our son does  not know Steely Dan  I could do donuts  if you give me a  modicum of respect I'll  show you donuts  his language is great  in that series right  yeah uh Doug in  Boston yeah I I've  been watching the show  for uh a little while  on Netflix and uh I  can only go so long  because I you know  there are a couple  episodes where you  watch and I'm like  it it totally drains  me I just uh I'm at 
[03:43:00]  like uh season four  episode six and uh I  gotta step away from  it for a little while  because it's a dark  show yeah oh really  dark well it's  mostly and I've been  like that means he's  really into it if he's  emotionally drained after  watching it yeah that's  great there's only a  couple shows that do  that to me but I've  been like that because  I've been uh like last  week GTA 5 came out for  PlayStation Xbox and we  all got copies so we've  all been playing it like  crazy but like I'd spend  the afternoons playing 
[03:43:30]  GTA 5 and then my wife  would get home so I'd  turn off the game and  say well what do you  want to watch and she'd  want to watch Breaking  Bad so I was just going  from like shooting  prostitutes and stealing  cars to watching this  guy's family fall apart  and it was just in my  mind it was just anarchy  and debauchery the world  is coming to an end yeah  feeling oh man there's  that show Breaking Bad do  you watch Sons of  Anarchy no I am aware  of it give it a try is  it good yeah it's really  good that's the other  show that I'm like oh  fuck like I can't keep 
[03:44:00]  watching this like it's  just like shit it just  keeps happening yeah like  horrible horrible the  worst things you could  imagine yeah like like  uh Norton is not into  break I wish I could  watch the show clean and  you know for the first  time you know he he can  do that yeah I know  every episode except with  the last one except this  last one last one's gonna  bring but yeah I mean you  don't know anything about  Sons of Anarchy right  uh no not really I think  this one actor on there I  like who's on that show 
[03:44:30]  is uh the blonde guys  the star uh uh what's his  name uh Ron Perlman yeah  that guy yeah he's good  he's great on it wolf  that's man face that's the  show you should move on to  is it Breaking Bad's over  yeah you get Katie Seagal  still on that show Katie  Seagal's on it everybody's  good on it and there's  brutality and it's awesome  Mitch in Staten Island  hey what's up Staten  Island my fifth favorite  borough oh Jesus Christ  we lost him phone drop  he was gonna say uh sorry  buddy he was gonna say  that they're gonna give 
[03:45:00]  him the Emmy next year  but you can give a guy  two Emmys like yeah if  he's the best actor and  he's then he's the best  actor again next year it's  movie you don't save up  and I mean a good movie  not shit yeah he's great  yeah Walter White's great  but uh but I was sitting  there and and now that I'm  caught up yeah it's you  can't really tweet about  anything and I don't  even know what I want to  say on the show here yeah  because people go crazy  over spoilers it used to  be that you don't want to  spoil it if you know in 
[03:45:30]  advance yeah like if you  got some kind of inside  track you can't spoil it  or the next day maybe you  don't want to give every  detail yeah but now like  you can't talk about  season three without  somebody getting upset  really is that right  yeah I just started  watching it man oh thanks  a lot I like when um  Jesse brought all those  bags of Funyuns to the  meth cook out in the  desert and Walter's like  Funyuns that's all you  brought how about a  vegetable how are you  even alive you love the  most obscure dialogue yeah  how are you alive when 
[03:46:00]  you memorize do you does  dialogue just stick in your  head because like I  always yeah when you  quote stuff yeah that's  why I was surprised with  Breaking Bad like you  always kind of get it  right on or very close to  being right on and and  some of these movies I'm  like oh well Otto's  obviously seen that movie  like 150,000 times yeah  but like the episode of  Breaking Bad you're quoting  was from like three weeks  ago I just I find that  scene hilarious just what  you know all the stuff he  goes through to fake that  the gasoline was not there 
[03:46:30]  to burn the house down  makes up this fucking  stupid story and tries to  sell it and they go so  that was my day how was  your day well you know  let's check into a nice  hotel it doesn't work for a  second not for a second  yeah anybody buy that  story yeah Brent in DC  hey what's up Sammy how  you doing buddy yeah I  just wanted to say you  know I called in talking  about how dark Breaking  Bad is and it reminds me  when Requiem for a Dream  came out like I literally 
[03:47:00]  wanted to hurt myself like  it put me in such a dark  place and there's parts of  Breaking Bad that really  do the same thing like you  said you got to take a  break and step back from  it but he's right because  Requiem for a Dream is  like an hour and a half  and it's like oh fuck  that have you seen it  no yeah it's pretty  fucked up but you go  through it and you're  like oh my god but  Breaking Bad it's like  they'll go through six  episodes of just  everything is horrible  yeah and if you're  watching that in a row  that's like six hours  yeah of just your brain 
[03:47:30]  being infused with  everything possibly going  terrible that's fine  there's the last thing I  wanted to say sorry to  interrupt that's fine  is that Todd character  I think he's gonna make a  name for himself he's  fucking amazing the actor  like it's just a complete  sociopath well his character  oh yeah yeah and that's  yeah and you wonder because  Todd is a character who's  brought on to the show and  he's a pretty important  character now yeah but he  was just brought on like this  season yeah and usually when 
[03:48:00]  you bring on a character like  that at the end of a beloved  show everybody's like who  the fuck is this guy he's  like an impecile killer like  when when when they were  watching Jesse talk about  him on that DVD they stole  from Hank's house he uh the  look on his face was like  I'm on TV you're not on TV  it's a DVD that we're gonna  give to the cops you know  the uncle gets it I'm gonna  go shoot him in the head he's  a rat you know he's such an  impecile he is he's a  complete and and he's just  got he's got some kind of  social disorder yeah because 
[03:48:30]  everything is just a blank  expression yeah okay yeah  all right yeah yeah okay  Mr. White do you need more  tea bags is it okay okay  I'll shoot him in the head  for you yeah exactly yeah  do you think do you think  he's a child yeah you think  his uncle's scared of him  like when he was going to  bring the ice cream to  Jesse when he was in the  pit oh and his uncle like  he's talking what are you  doing blah blah blah like  you were saying the uncle  just wants to kill him  because he's a rat yeah  Todd will say something and  then the uncle just kind of  loses all emotion and just  stares at him for a little  bit and then he goes oh  yeah you're okay you're okay 
[03:49:00]  I think the uncle's scared  of this kid of which of Todd  of Todd I think that's a  that's a thought I don't  I don't know I think he's  just that's that's my  nephew it's the one guy I'm  not going to kill in the  room and a drop of a hat or  something he loves his  nephew yeah yeah I think  that's I mean there's very  little love in that yeah  person yeah I don't know the  gang thing got complicated but  Todd is actually one of the  few characters that a show  brings in at the end of a  season at the end of a  series and it's like yeah  okay well the Robert Forster  guy the the cleaner who 
[03:49:30]  to relocated Walter up into  New Hampshire yeah I could I  could use a lot more of that  guy he's a great character  yeah he's really good that's  I would watch I wish he would  get a spin-off show yeah he's  very matter-of-fact he's not  like you know a bad guy he's  just got this side thing  involves getting Mert  monsters out of town quickly  but there's this great scene  where it's like throughout the  show they're at the episode  where he's talking to Walter I'll  try to do it without too many  spoilers yeah but throughout the  episode where he's talking to  Walter you get the impression 
[03:50:00]  that he's compassionate for  him yeah and he like feels for  this guy but then there's that  one moment where Walter brings  up the money yeah and you  realize that that guy doesn't  he doesn't give a shit about  Walter it's all yeah we give it  to my family he goes well if I  told you I would would you  believe me or something like  that yeah like and Walter knows  he's not gonna give my family  anything yeah anything yeah  that's when he stuffs that  that box with the money and  right yeah yeah Tom in New  York hey guys a couple of  things first if I'm not  mistaken Brian Cranston won the 
[03:50:30]  Emmy the last three years in a  row for Bright Breaking Bad good  and Aaron Paul won one year for  best supporting actor so he's  already been well rewarded although  I agree I did think they were  going to give it to him and I was  stunned that Jeff Daniels won it  I do like I do like newsroom yeah  but he stood up there chomping on  his gums he was just horrifically  inappropriate and I think the way  this is going to end is Walter is  going to escape everybody else is  going to pay the price and he's 
[03:51:00]  going to be sitting in Belize or on  an island somewhere with his money  and then he's going to die from  cancer oh that's good he should be  alone and dead from cancer who knows  exactly thanks thanks Tom he wins  but he loses oh that's like real  life yeah maybe we'll just end like  that with him coughing and in front  he just dying and that's the way he's  always been though he's always been  that guy who's like he's getting  ahead yeah but he's just shit but  you know what I mean I was thinking  his coffee returned and it sounds  really bad but if you watch like the 
[03:51:30]  season one the his cough was pretty  intense in those early episodes as  well yeah where you know he couldn't  catch his breath I think it was worse  early on yeah but it's like a thread  through his performance that's clearly  just brilliant you know it really is  really great Bob in Arizona I was just  wondering what do you guys think of  the foreshadowing because in the first  episode of each season there's always a  bit of foreshadowing and in this season  when it opened up this last season  Walter shows up to his house it's all 
[03:52:00]  burned up and destroyed and the neighbor  comes out I've never in my life heard  that word pronounced that way what  foreshadowing oh foreshadowing yeah I've  heard foreshadowing I've never heard of  foreshadowing yeah but you know you  you mean the woman who dropped the bag  of groceries when she saw him with the  beard yeah yeah you know so obviously  he's come back his hair is all back he  doesn't have a cancer so how do you  think that's gonna play out well I mean  we already kind of saw he's in you know 
[03:52:30]  he'll leave where he's at now and come  back but at the beginning of the of this  half season he was in the house wasn't  he looking for the ricin yes so that  still has to be explained to yes yeah he  has that automatic weapon he wants to  kill the bikers because they took 11  million dollars 70 million 70 million  dollars from him so where you do like  when somebody spoils when you read  something yeah that somebody wrote about  because you haven't watched a show when  it's on live are you pissed that they're 
[03:53:00]  talking about it you're like absolutely  are you if you're into the you know the  show I don't want to I don't want  somebody I would that's grounds for  murder but fucking ruining the one thing  in my week that you know looking  forward to Sunday night see it in my  head I'm like I'm the dumb fuck for  not watching it oh it was on oh well I  mean you're you got a busy life you're  married you got this your own radio show  you can't think about other shit how long  is how long can you say that's  acceptable what's the cutoff time for 
[03:53:30]  spoilers what do you know season three  was a few years ago and somebody's  yelling that you're okay so you're saying  three days three days I mean otherwise  you're not that into it yeah you're too  busy so you know the show's on on  Sunday today's Thursday we could  literally be talking about anything  that's happened up till we could talk  about last week's episode I think so  yeah I mean yeah people that watch it  like you know if whatever the best thing  would be to tape Sunday night at nine  o'clock and start watching it at about  915 so you can fast forward the 
[03:54:00]  commercial right at least you can it'll  have that feel that's the way to do it  yeah yeah because I can't picture this  is the first time I'm gonna have to  watch that show with commercials yeah  it's pretty it's it really sucks it's  better to watch it straight through I  can't wait to see the box set come out  that'll be awesome I feel like I feel  like as far as spoilers go if you know  that some like if you hear that we're  talking about it on the radio you turn  off the show and let us have our  conversation yeah or if you're trying 
[03:54:30]  to not have Twitter spoil something for  you just stay off Twitter for a while  yeah you know what I mean or if you're  three seasons behind yeah deal with the  fact that you didn't get to experience  it when it happened two index fingers in  the ears and then hum loudly right for a  week and a half and squint your eye  squint your eyelids for a while yeah  Eric what do you think as far as  spoilers go well how much leniency do  you give well I was trying to say when  you said somebody was yelling at you  because they were on season three yeah  it's but you know what that was a few 
[03:55:00]  years ago because they spaced it out  especially season five is a half season  half season so that was spaced out even  more at that point what can you do so  how long do you how long do you give  people do you say like for me I'm  literally if I want to talk about this  on Monday I'm going to talk about it  and it's up to you to avoid it yeah  like I'm not going to go up to you  auto and say oh you haven't watched it  yet we'll wait till I tell you and just  blab it and spoil it sure purpose but if  I'm talking about it you know step out of  the room and if it's something that  was a big deal that happened in that 
[03:55:30]  episode it's on all the entertainment  shows the next day it is yeah yeah so  like Monday at 7 if you're watching  extra or access Hollywood stuff like  that they'll talk about such-and-such  died you know what's coming next for the  for the finale of Breaking Bad it's  already out what am I going to be the  last guy talking about it because I want  to be nice  yeah you know because I want to make sure  I don't hurt anybody's weekend it's up  to the guy who hasn't seen it to  relocate go to another room like you  said right right or head out to New  Hampshire and live in a cabin for a  while you get relocated with Walter  White down you're going to break up my 
[03:56:00]  party by the way yes you see the  finale of Dexter now when I heard it  died it's terrible I hated no but the  yeah I hated her too with her fucking  stroke mouth the way she curses just  because it's on Showtime it's like give  me a hug fuckface it's not organic yeah  no it's very for not a non-organic at  all but the all right spoilers at the end  of the entire series there it's sort of  like they got to where Breaking Bad is 
[03:56:30]  now and didn't know what to do yeah  because he's alone in a cabin he's  hiding from everyone else he's got a  beard well Breaking Bad it seems like  Vince Gilligan has had a plan for that  show from day one seems like it and it's  all worked out beautifully like no at no  point in that show did it ever seem like  oh they just dug themselves into a hole  they don't know how to get out of like  lost yeah it was good for a couple  seasons and I realized they had to do  more and didn't have a way to end the  show the one episode that people  complained about was that woman they're 
[03:57:00]  trying to find a fly in the cook room  yeah I was into that yeah I find that  boring I was okay with it but that was  only because I wasn't watching week to  week right like if I only got an hour of  Breaking Bad every week and that's the  hour I got yeah I would have been like  really yeah this is the this is what I  have to watch them chase a fly yeah but  since I could just be like well let me  watch the next episode right now yeah  okay everything's fine again it's just  to see Walter running back and forth and  piling boxes up and trying to kill this  fucking thing he's he's just a very  watchable actor you know he just makes 
[03:57:30]  it interesting and watching the mania of  his brain just play itself out on this  yeah or fly  you know let me go to max in Dallas hey  what's going on guys okay Otto you rock  thank you Max hey actually I had a I'd agree with  Sam about watching sons of anarchy now  after breaking that yeah and the two guys  that they got his new characters this  season the guy that plays the Marshall  Donna Logue yeah and the other guy that 
[03:58:00]  plays I can't remember what his name is he  owns like the bakery but he's kind of  like a mafia looking guy oh yeah that's  Peter Weller  Robocop not only that dude played Robocop he  was one of my professors at Syracuse no  way yes Robocop was Robocop taught you he  taught a history of the Roman Empire  through film that's crazy yeah and he was  just sitting there he's all full of  himself we'd have these three hour long  classes was he this is post Robocop  Robocop this was like eight years ago  wow and everybody knew he was and try he 
[03:58:30]  knew he was he'd wear these pants that  were so tight you could see the head of  his cock in him Jesus and and he'd sit  there and we'd have three hour long  classes because you're supposed to watch a  movie in the class and then talk about it  but he was so full of himself he just  sit there lecturing for three full hours  we'd be sitting there like please yeah  somebody give me a gun Robocop's helmet  looks good today I have a comment and a  question Robocop Jesus we didn't say I  remember one day he was wearing those  pants and we were sitting right up front 
[03:59:00]  and I was sitting next to a girl and I  hadn't said anything about it and I was  like fuck it halfway through the class I  leaned over to her and said hey have you  seen she was like don't say a word about  it she knew exactly what I was talking  about yeah he's had a nothing career  since then no except now he's in Sons of  Anarchy and you gotta watch but Donald  Logue is my favorite character this  season I don't know if you know Donald  Logue is he was on a sitcom called  Grounded for Life okay for a couple  seasons on Fox and he was also he was 
[03:59:30]  the cab driver in the MTV vignettes in  like the mid 90s uh-huh they would MTV  would do their like in the middle of  commercial breaks just do like a 30-second  skit or whatever for MTV yeah and he was  this greasy cab driver from New York  what's Sons of Anarchy about it's just a  show about a biker gang oh and like you  like really nasty pricks and yeah and they  deal with horrible people and like every  season there's like an arc for that  specific season pretty much and like this  year they the first episode they're getting 
[04:00:00]  a ton of heat for it because they start  with a school shooting oh on the show  yeah some little kid goes in that's  touchy yeah exactly what channel is that  on FX FX okay uh but uh but Donald Logue is  on this season and he's normally a comic  actor but now he's like out of his mind he's  on heroin he's fucking prostitutes and  shooting them like he is the he's the  craziest and he's trying to bust this  biker gang and pretending he's like a U.S. 
[04:00:30]  marshal oh man it's sick it's awesome  that's what got me because uh yeah  Donald Logue played that father in that  sitcom and he was a real you know wacky  goofy nice guy whatever and he's a  fucking insane old man on on Sons of  Anarchy she's like holy shit yeah yeah  yeah and they always have like all right  buddy thanks a lot like one episode one  season like like you know one of the  guys kids gets kidnapped last season  they threw a girl through one of the 
[04:01:00]  guys daughters and burned her alive like  damn yeah they go to a ridiculous  dark place on this series what about um  cursing did FX cool with cursing yeah  they say I don't think they drive F  bombs I'm not sure no they don't but  they definitely say shit it's the same  thing say basically the same thing as uh  Breaking Bad right okay like have you  noticed that on Breaking Bad they'll leave  fuck in but they'll like they'll mute out  to you so yeah yeah or uh fag that they're 
[04:01:30]  not cool with saying the word fag right  that's weird when when cable channels set  rules like that like they're like you know  what we're okay with cursing but not all  cursing yeah like we're good with like  three or four of the seven dirty words  yeah just let it go you know once you  commit to it just go for it just just let  the curses go what are they some old  ladies gonna write a letter so you tear it  up you know yeah it's it's a show it's  we're talking about two shows one they're  both on at night on Sunday yeah one is  about a meth dealer whose wife tried to 
[04:02:00]  stab him yeah and the other one is about  a biker gang who uh kills prostitutes and  tries to clear themselves of uh yeah of  being tied into a school shooting so yeah  you know it's not like these are  regardless of what language is being  used the content is not exactly kid  friendly that's right it's not the sound  of music I mean just let an occasional  fuck through fucking right like but  naturally and not like you're saying  like Dexter did with Showtime there's  nothing worse yeah and when they're like 
[04:02:30]  yeah we're gonna have cursing yeah so  let's just put it in yeah let's just make  it edgy yeah like just I know the guy's  supposed to be a dead like like an  emotionless zombie the Dexter guy but I  don't see that guy is an interesting  actor or anything just got that little  five o'clock shadow and just I don't  know I never was able to get into Dexter  you should see his previous show six  feet under oh that that was a good show  yeah he was good in that that was more  like a drama though that was a big hit  too right James Cromwell's in it too  yeah yeah that is good yeah but I would 
[04:03:00]  say I would say yeah Otto now that you're  better yeah you gotta have your TV lined  up so I would say Sons of Anarchy is the  way to go I'll get into that I just  like to commit to too many shows I just  I'm what other shows you watching I'm  all about Breaking Bad until this thing  ends then I'll probably you know and  you gotta pick you gotta pick wisely  because you're gonna have your one  show yeah yeah I mean I I mean I'm  interested to hear what you think of  Sons of Anarchy okay I'll definitely  get back to you on that give it a try  yeah Otto by the way tonight and
