<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, featuring recurring segments like "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," "Morning Zoo Bits," "Can't Say That Wednesday," and "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday."  The "Morning Zoo Bits" segment repeatedly mocked a poorly-executed O.J. Simpson song parody from Scott and Todd, also harshly criticizing their appearance with offensive language. This critique, along with the parody itself, was revisited throughout the show.  The show featured numerous listener calls, many contributing to the "Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday" segment with accounts ranging from using a blowtorch to yelling at a 12-year-old brother.  One caller's method involved yelling at his wife.  Other calls included listener-submitted pirate jokes (in honor of International Talk Like a Pirate Day), which were interspersed throughout the broadcast and included a sexually suggestive joke.

A significant portion focused on a video of a college student at a John Kerry rally who, after a rambling question about voter fraud and the Skull and Bones society, was tased while resisting arrest. The hosts and callers debated the authenticity of the student's actions, with commentary on the audio quality and a missed opportunity to bleep a vulgarity.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy, along with intern Renee, discussed the video extensively, critiquing the student's increasingly whiny responses ("Don't tase me, bro"). Renee's musical selections were repeatedly criticized, culminating in her dismissal.  The show also included listener-submitted techno remixes of show clips and a discussion of a prior segment with D.L. Hughley.

Another recurring joke relentlessly mocked Joe Nolan, a traffic reporter, using offensive terms describing his physique.  The hosts also dissected a poorly written song parody, repeatedly using the phrase "sleazy mother." They discussed the upcoming XM and Sirius merger, expressing concern about job security and criticizing Howard Stern.  Jesse Jackson's comment about Barack Obama "acting white" was discussed, along with listener opinions on Howard Stern and the impact of the 94.1 WISP radio format change. A planned "crappy parody song contest" was also mentioned.

A segment covered the "Jenna 6" case, a controversial high school fight involving racial tensions, alongside surveillance videos of robberies from Break.com, focusing on the racial demographics of the perpetrators.  A phone interview with Howie Mandel, promoting *Deal or No Deal*, discussed Mandel's OCD, the show, and his new high-tech toilet.  Musical interludes included fart remixes and a listener's song based on a Jim Norton Van Halen song snippet.  Callers from Louisiana offered their perspectives on the "Jenna 6" case.

The show's conclusion featured the announcement of their return, followed by discussion of the "Miss Pal Talk" contest, offering $500 to the winner.  The rules allowed contestants to do "whatever they want," leading to a debate about the authenticity of an entry and crude descriptions of sexual acts involving a log.  The broadcast ended with the "Line of the Day" segment, sponsored by Bodogfantasy.net, featuring several vulgar and sexually suggestive entries.  Howie Mandel was the only guest during the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I want to be called the A-man.  Like you're the I-man, I want to be the A-man.  How about I call you the A-H-man?  Go get started again now.  Opie and Anthony.  In the middle of the night, I get an email from Eric that I read this morning when I got up.  that he's very, very depressed 
[00:01:00]  because his refrigerator door fell off.  It made a break for him.  Obi and Anthony, stupid Australians  whose national hero got killed  by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And it begins. 
[00:01:30]  The Obi and Anthony show.  Good morning, Anthony.  Good morning, Obi.  And of course, Jimmy.  Good morning.  I never just say good morning  to the guys I do the radio show with.  No.  We could give a crap.  Save the good mornings for the office.  Yes, on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:02:00]  Am I right?  It is Wednesday, right?  Jesus.  Well, it is Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Yes, Anthony.  Yes.  And we'll talk about that a little later this morning.  But it's also Morning Zoo Bits.  How do you say it, Jimmy?  Bits.  Morning Zoo Bits.  Love the day Wednesday.  I'm going to play a couple of hacky Morning Zoo Bits for you today.  And we focus on a morning show in New York City. 
[00:02:30]  Oh.  Wow.  One of the bits we're going to be playing today  is from Scott and Todd's morning show here in New York City.  Well, then it's got to be genius.  Oh, they're playing an OJ song parody.  That's just brilliant.  Stop.  So we'll be featuring that today.  I probably shouldn't really goof on OJ song parodies.  I'd be knocking 10 if it wasn't.  Yours was terrific.  Of course it was.  It was genius.  We might have to dust that off and play it. 
[00:03:00]  He is sitting in jail.  It's Vegas.  Also, it's Can't Say That Wednesday.  And it's also Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  We changed that.  A little confusion out there if you weren't listening yesterday.  Because I know you keep track of this crap out there in Radio Land.  People are freaking out.  It used to be a Tuesday bit, but Tuesday has about 10 to 12 themes now.  So we had to take one and move it to Wednesday.  And it's kind of cool that we moved it to Wednesday 
[00:03:30]  because we got a guy on the phone, Steve, from Orange County.  Steve.  Yo.  You want to wake up your spouse?  Yeah.  All right.  Give us some details here.  Is it your wife, girlfriend, boyfriend?  What do you got?  My wife.  All right.  Your wife.  And how are you going to wake her up?  I got a blowtorch.  Jimmy said it's Wake Up Your Wife with a Blowtorch.  Wake her up with a blowtorch.  Wait.  Did you suggest that, Jimmy, yesterday?  I was saying that should be the name of the bit, yes, Wake Up Your Spouse.  He did.  But I was just being a goose.  Well, what are you going to do with the blowtorch, sir? 
[00:04:00]  All I got to do is walk in and light it up.  You know, it's pretty loud when it lights up.  It'll get things going.  You know what I mean?  Get a nice pop.  All right.  Promise us that you're not going to, like, burn your wife or burn down your house.  We'll try to keep away from the curtains and the hair.  All right.  Here's Steve in Orange County.  He wants to wake up his wife with a blowtorch.  All right. 
[00:04:30]  Wake up, honey.  Wake up.  Why are you doing that?  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday with a blowtorch.  He just did it.  Yes.  Wait, wait.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  He really did.  I heard this.  Hey, Steve, that's all right, man.  All right. 
[00:05:00]  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Take care.  Just a quickie to kick off Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday with a blowtorch.  He did it with a blowtorch.  He took you seriously, Jimmy.  What an awful thing to wake up to.  No kidding.  She's like, what are you doing?  Steve, what are you doing?  I bet you that's what a lot of people say when their spouse ends up murdering them.  Yeah.  Because you don't expect it.  All of a sudden, you're like, what are you doing with that axe?  That's the last thing you say.  Hey, you know what?  Doing that hammer, Carl? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  I think there's a lot of surprise, the last thing you say, before your spouse kills you.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what are you doing?  That's what she said right there.  That could have been like...  That could have ended with...  A murder.  Her whole body up in flames.  But there you go.  Now I'm thinking that the bit has finally officially taken off.  Because now I know our listeners, they're going to try to figure out a better way to wake up their spouse.  How do you beat blowtorch? 
[00:06:00]  The audio could have been better, but you got the groggy audio of the wife going, Steve, what are you doing?  Swanson.  All right.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  That's 877-212-ON-A.  Hold on a minute.  Swanson.  Hey, I want to know if I can substitute wake up your spouse for wake up your brother.  Yeah, it's basically wake up someone you live with.  Just wake up anyone in the house.  But we had to come up with some kind of name for this dumb thing.  So, yeah, sure. 
[00:06:30]  How are you going to wake him up, Swanson?  Actually, I'm just going to walk in screaming.  Okay.  Hold on.  Swanson.  Hey, you open the door in the office.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  What the hell's the hell out of you? 
[00:07:00]  That is fantastic.  Hey, Ryan.  Who was it that you woke up?  Yeah, Swanson.  How old's your brother?  Twelve.  Twelve?  Twelve?  Oh, that's why he was like...  Eh!  Because he reverted back to being about four or five, and then he sounded like an almost  teenager.  But he started like, eh, mommy!  Yeah, I think my mom's going to use this as a reason for me that I'm being influenced 
[00:07:30]  by you guys now.  Yeah, that's all right.  There you go.  We got two already.  Wow.  We've been doing this bit for about a month.  We get one here and there, and already we got two.  Okay.  Gotta go, guys.  All right.  You're a good boy.  Sometimes it takes a while to get these bits going, so there you go.  All right.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  So far, we got a blowtorch and a guy screaming at his...  Just screaming.  That was an obnoxious scream, too.  It really was.  Hey, also, I want to say good morning to all the pirates out there. 
[00:08:00]  Pirates?  I'm sure...  Are there any pirates left?  I'm sure a morning zoo show in your town is doing something with the fact that it's  International Talk Like a Pirate Day.  It isn't.  I swear to God.  Today is International Talk Like a Pirate Day.  But who made that up?  Who made it up?  The pirates.  International.  The pirates?  They just gave a little attention today?  Everywhere.  In India.  In China.  Everyone is talking like a pirate.  Mm-hmm.  How come we make stupid things in this country and then call it international? 
[00:08:30]  You know that is not anywhere else.  It has to be international.  The pirates come from somewhere else.  You don't have pirates from America.  You have pirates that are hanging out in the waters off the shores of America in international  waters.  There used to be English pirates.  Huh?  I think it was the English pirates.  Yeah.  That's who we imitate the most of, right?  Arr.  Arr.  Métis.  Aren't they from Penzance? 
[00:09:00]  Pirates from Penzance?  Where's Penzance?  We really talk like idiots on this show.  Can't we start talking like men again?  Yeah.  The modern pirates just use like RPGs and little Zodiac boats.  Yeah.  And they come up to cruise ships and try to rob them.  Yeah.  True.  So talk like a pirate day.  It's kind of hard these days.  I don't know.  No, no.  No.  You got to go old school.  If you're going to talk like a pirate today, do the old school pirate. 
[00:09:30]  Okay.  Arr.  Arr.  Matey.  Okay.  Arr.  Avast.  Avast.  Matey.  Here you go.  Arr.  Okay.  International talk like a pirate day.  This is stupid.  Well, Cap'n.  Cap'n.  Cap'n.  Cap'n Slappy.  And old Chum Bucket.  I thought it was something else.  Are the founders of talk like a pirate day.  Arr.  I saw old Chum Bucket, but I didn't see a certain letter. 
[00:10:00]  Let's just put it this way.  A little too early to see the H.  Yeah.  I was thinking the same thing.  I thought they were talking about our old PD Jeremy Coleman.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  I know you are out there, aren't you?  Invented in 1995 by John Bauer. 
[00:10:30]  He's old Chum Bucket.  Yeah.  And Mark Summers, Cap and Slappy, not the same Mark Summers from that kid show there, Double  Dare.  Oh, Double Dare.  No, don't get him confused.  Isn't he the OCD freak?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're both of the United States who proclaim September 19th each year when everyone should  talk like a pirate.  Arr.  For example, an observer of the holiday would greet his friends not with a hello, but with an ahoy me hearty.  The date was selected because it's the birthday of Summer's ex-wife and consequently would be easy for him to remember. 
[00:11:00]  Well, easy for him, I guess.  He remembers dates of ex-wife's things and marriages and things like that.  Everyone knows I can't remember that.  At first, an inside joke between two friends gained exposure when Barron Summer sent a letter about their invented holiday to the American syndicated humor columnist Dave Barry.  Dave Barry is humorless.  He liked the idea.  Oh, is he awful? 
[00:11:30]  He couldn't be funny if he grabbed this and ran with it.  This is, um...  See, this has nothing to do with international...  It's not international.  These two idiots decided to do this.  On a whim.  Hey.  And they dressed like pirates.  Hey, uh, I got a phone call coming in from Max from Fairfield.  Max.  And I'm telling the dump guy down the hall to get ready, because it is, can't say that, Wednesday.  Yes.  Uh, Max, what's going on? 
[00:12:00]  Hey, guys, how's it going?  Hey.  Since it's International Pirate Day, doesn't the Asian pirates say L instead of R?  That would be the...  That's what would happen.  Maybe you didn't have to dump out of that.  Hey, that's funny, Max.  Way to go.  There he goes.  So, if you call him the show, you know, just acknowledge that it's International Talk Like  a Pirate Day, all right?  Oh, please.  Arr!  Another hacky bit that all the, uh, the hacky stations will be doing.  Oh, well, and I got something for the pal talkers today and the instant feedbackers today. 
[00:12:30]  A very interactive radio show, this Opie and Anthony show.  Did you know today is the birthday, the 25th birthday?  25th birthday.  Of what?  Oh, I know this already.  Yeah, okay.  You do know?  Yeah.  Jimmy, do you know?  I do.  No, he probably doesn't.  I do.  All right, what is it?  It's my favorite thing.  Yeah?  Which is the semicolon or colon and half a parenthesis. 
[00:13:00]  Wow, he does indeed know.  Wow, you suck.  That little symbol, which on most computer keyboards would have been, hi, how are you?  It's that app's face.  The smiley face.  Smiley face.  The computer smiley face turns 25 today.  So, there you go.  Have fun on instant feedback and pal talk today as you celebrate the smiley face birthday.  Pointy hat, curly hair, winky eye, smiley face. 
[00:13:30]  There you go.  All right.  25 years.  What were they putting it on 25 years ago?  Who's the first person that looked at that and said, it's sideways, but it looks like a  smiley face.  Mm-hmm.  He would think by now we could have, like, a smiley face that's, like, right side up.  Yeah.  Why we still have to have our smiley faces sideways.  Love of God. 
[00:14:00]  Some of them will convert it now to a symbol.  Like, when you hit that, you'll have, like, a little yellow smiley face.  Sometimes it's like a little squiggly mouth, like a little...  Or a frown.  There's so many expressions.  I'm very insulted by Awful Me.  He writes, 25th anniversary of Opie graduating elementary school.  How dare you?  I'm not that old.  I'm hoping more people wake up their spouse today. 
[00:14:30]  Or someone else in the house.  Do you guys feel the excitement?  Right off the bat, we get a guy waking his wife up with a blowtorch.  I like that.  And a guy screaming at his 12-year-old brother.  Yeah.  And I just felt like the phones were just going to rock.  Yep.  We need more.  This is the hour where you wake up the people.  What happened?  Sorry.  They're just showing that.  We'll get into that a little later.  How about we'll do it after the break?  That sounds good.  What is...  What's that about, by the way?  We're talking about...  We're seeing the video of John Kerry, the guy at the John Kerry thing.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  He's been all over the place.  John Kerry's at a university.  And he's taking questions from the crowd.  And some guy gets up there, some snot-nosed, like, college douche.  Douche.  And starts questioning John Kerry about his...  Why he gave up the election so quickly when there were so many allegations of voter fraud.  Didn't you want to be president, he said.  And then he started asking him if he belonged to the Skull and Bones, just like George Bush does. 
[00:15:30]  And the police, I guess they cut his mic off.  And then he walked away going, oh, I can't talk, I can't talk, and wouldn't leave.  So the police grabbed his arms to usher him away from the microphone.  And I think their intention was just to get him out of there, because he was becoming a disturbance.  He then started resisting arrest.  Once you...  Like, they were saying, oh, my God, he's arrested for what he was saying.  No, the second he started resisting arrest is when, you know, they started strong-arming him. 
[00:16:00]  Because he was being, like I said, a douche.  But now they're saying it's staged.  How is...  You can't stage that in front of John Kerry?  Well, he did it on purpose.  Oh, he did it on purpose.  Like, he resisted and wanted the cops to really, like, pour it on.  Apparently he has some kind of a website.  I don't know what the whole story about the scam is, because it's still...  They still don't know if it's a scam or not.  Well, it's pretty impressive that you would do that in front of a, you know, a political leader.  Favorite line, though, of the day. 
[00:16:30]  Don't tase me, bro.  Well, let's get into it.  We've got a few more minutes.  Right before they do.  So here's the guy asking the long question at the John Kerry rally.  Sir, I first and foremost want to thank you for your time.  You spent a lot of time talking to those here.  I want to thank you for coming and being open and honest.  You recommended a book to us earlier.  I didn't want to recommend a book to you.  It's called Our Madhouse by Greg Kallax.  Do I have a touch?  Yeah, and he's the top investigative journalist in America. 
[00:17:00]  I've already read it.  And he says you won the 2004 election.  Isn't that amazing?  Isn't that amazing?  You won in 2004.  In fact, there were multiple reports on the day of the election of disenfranchisement of black voters in Portland and Ohio.  I'll ask my question.  Thank you very much.  I'll ask my question.  I'm going to preface it.  He's been talking for two hours.  I think I can have two minutes.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I'm going to ask you my question.  I'm going to inform people, and then I'm going to ask you my question.  So there are multiple reports of disenfranchisement of black voters on you. 
[00:17:30]  I'd have tased them right here.  Oh, yeah.  There was also voting machines, electronic voting machines in Lewish County, Florida, that counted backwards.  So amidst all these reports of phony, bogus stuff going on, how could you concede the election on the day?  How could you concede the 2004 election on the day?  In this book, it says there were five million votes that were suppressed that you won the election.  Didn't you want to be president?  I'm not even gunning.  I have two more questions.  If you were still up against Iran, how come you're not saying, let's impeach Bush now?  Impeach Bush now before you can invade Iran. 
[00:18:00]  Why don't we impeach Bush?  Impeach Bush.  Planned was impeach for what?  Blows out?  Why don't we impeach Bush?  All right.  Also, were you a member of Skull and Broome?  All right.  Who edited that?  Secret society is Bush.  Were you in Skull and Broome?  Thank you for cutting my mic.  Wait, what happened?  The guy dropped the, he drops the.  The international, the international word for thanks for dinner.  Yeah, there's an oral treats reference in there.  Oh.  That he just blurted out and wasn't bleeped. 
[00:18:30]  Who listened to that and didn't think that, and thought that was good for air?  Holy Jesus.  What?  What happened?  Iraq?  What happened?  Well, there's not a political rally, so it's okay, right?  What happened, Iraq?  No, I'm just letting you know that we caught it.  It's dumped.  Yeah.  Well, that's great.  They caught it down the hall.  Who listened to it?  But then they lose some audio, you know, because the dumps...  I just want to know who listened to it. 
[00:19:00]  Who listened to it and was supposed to bleep that part?  Anyone?  No one?  That's fantastic.  Sam.  Sam?  Okay, Sam.  Sam.  Sam's the douche of the morning.  Sam has to be fired.  Oh, well.  How do you listen to that and not know that the guy said...  That he said the B word.  B-J.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, all right.  Oh, God, I hate working with these letters.  How about we take a break and we'll get into the rest of the audio after the break? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, because it gets fun.  Because now we've got to make sure it's nice and clean.  Yeah.  So we don't get anyone fired.  Because he does curse up a storm in there before that.  He starts saying F-you and things like that.  Well, basically...  That's bleeped.  Well, we'll see.  Here, why don't you make sure.  Maybe Sam's a little tired today.  But basically, that's where we're up to.  You know, the guy asked a very long question.  Obviously, there's going to be a problem.  And then they come up to him and then they tase him and he just loses his freaking mind. 
[00:20:00]  Could be the whiniest tasing ever.  Oh, yeah.  I've heard women being tased that didn't sound this whiny.  You're applauding the tasing.  Very early on in this audio.  All right.  We'll get into that next and a few other things.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hi, good morning.  Opie and Anthony here.  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Want to say hi to all the women on Pal Talk.  Acknowledging that it is Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Yes.  They know what to do on Wednesdays.  There's wow stickers all over the place. 
[00:20:30]  Wow signs on the back of cars.  Written in the dirt.  That means whip them out, ladies.  Whip them out.  And guys don't harass the women.  Some of them want to flash on the way to work and that's it.  That's it.  But they're looking for those wow stickers as we speak.  So they've been very good over the years.  I got to tell you, man, the wowing at the virus shows this summer.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  All over the parking lot, during the show, after the show. 
[00:21:00]  An amazing display.  Very, very cool.  Also, it's international, uh, what is it?  International talk.  Talk like a pirate day.  Well, this guy's been on hold for a long time, so let's get this over with.  Jim in New York, what's up?  R me.  Hey, what's up, Jim?  R.  Would you like to hear me pirate joke?  Uh, yes.  What's a pirate's favorite doctor?  Hold on now.  A pirate's favorite doctor.  A podiatrist? 
[00:21:30]  Would you like to know?  Yes.  Yes.  It's the I, doctor.  All right, get out of here.  I, doctor.  Hope I didn't dump that down the hall.  Well, it is international talk like a pirate, uh, day, so.  I, it's a treat for everybody, isn't it?  I like that.  Yes.  Also, morning zoo bits of the day, Wednesday.  Can't say that Wednesday.  No.  And wake up your spouse Wednesday, and if you're just tuning in, so far we had a guy 
[00:22:00]  wake up his wife with a blowtorch, and we had a guy wake up his brother by just walking  in his room and obnoxiously screaming as loud as he can.  Screaming.  And we thought that would really, really start something today, and now we're back to nothing  with this bit.  So hopefully we'll get a couple more.  But that was good.  That was definitely really, really good.  All right, back to the Kerry audio.  When we last left you, where were we at there, Anthony?  Well, this guy was on the mic.  He was asking John Kerry a question, and he got out of hand. 
[00:22:30]  They turned his mic off, and the cops start kind of dragging him away.  But I don't think we're up to that point yet.  He's still kind of trying to ask his question.  Right.  And then because you can't say that, I guess that's why Sam left in an inappropriate word.  And people are now suggesting that we take Sam's WWE belt away from him for a day.  We've got to punish him somehow.  That would kill him.  He does walk around here every day with that dumb WWE belt.  That would kill him.  That he got for his birthday, and we're thinking we should just take it away from him for a day. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Give him a little punishment.  What, is he the champion of missed opportunities to help the show?  Yes.  Of course.  Champion of trying to get us in trouble.  All right, here's the student.  Security comes in to arrest the guy.  Thank you.  Are you going to arrest me?  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  What are you arresting me for?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Is anybody watching this?  I'm not doing this.  I want you to do this.  Anyone else hear Dane Cook in here?  Exactly what I was thinking.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Sounds like Dane Cook.  He does sound like Dane.  What, are you going to arrest me?  You can even hear a fat, bald guy in the back going, dude, he's my mail ticket.  Dude.  Don't arrest him, dude.  Leave him alone.  Thank you.  Are you going to arrest me?  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  What are you arresting me for?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Is anybody watching this?  I'm not doing this.  I want you to do this.  Get off me.  Get off me.  What are you doing?  Get off me.  Hey.  Hey.  What are you doing?  What a whiny ass.  What is going on? 
[00:24:00]  What is going on?  I want to stand and listen to you after my question.  Help.  Help.  Help.  Are you kidding me?  All right.  He's yelling help.  Help.  God, I hate this kid.  He's yelling help.  He's so obviously a whiny little brat.  Yeah.  And it could be a big put on.  Yeah.  Well, it's a put on for his, but.  For like his.  But John Kerry's not in on it.  The taser guy's not in on it. 
[00:24:30]  No.  The security guys are not in on it.  No.  He's hoping that.  You want to take one for the team.  I didn't think he'd be tased.  He's hoping to get some kind of crazy reaction, right?  Yeah.  So he gets his name out there.  I guess just be escorted out of the place.  But I don't think he thought he was going to be tased.  Well, he made the front page of.  Which is great.  You know, drudge report.  So he did something right.  I'm glad he got tased.  Here we go.  So they taser the guy and listen to the reaction.  Why are they arresting me?  Can someone do something here?  Let me just show you that.  Can someone arrest me?  What did I do?  Get off me. 
[00:25:00]  Nobody.  Get off me.  Get off me.  Get off me.  Get the f*** off me, man.  I didn't do anything.  Don't tase me, bro.  Don't tase me.  I didn't do anything.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Let me go.  Yeah.  Let me go.  Oh, my God.  Why did I do?  What did I do?  Please.  Tell me. 
[00:25:30]  Why is the crowd outraged and yelling stuff like that?  I would be laughing my ass off.  Oh, dude, there was.  There's about five or so different angles of that whole thing.  People with the cell phone.  There's a couple of different camera views.  And there's one view, and it's a guy on a cell phone camera.  And you see across the aisle, there's just two regular kind of dude-like guys.  Yeah.  And they're just hanging out laughing.  Oh, good.  Laughing at this guy the whole time.  All right.  Thank God.  A couple of people with sense. 
[00:26:00]  But they did get the student under control, and I got audio after the taser.  Oh, okay.  The taser ring of the student.  Sound a little different.  I like turtles.  I like turtles.  I like turtles.  Want to hear that again?  Yes.  All right.  The student getting tased.  Why are they arresting me?  Can someone do something here?  Let me just shoot.  I'm arresting me.  What did I do?  Get off me.  Nobody ever hit off me.  Get off me.  Get off me, man.  I didn't do anything.  Don't tase me, bro. 
[00:26:30]  Don't tase me.  I can't do anything.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Can we go?  Can we go?  Can we go?  It's just a bad dream, fat boy.  Oh, my God.  What?  What did I do?  Police brutality.  Police brutality.  Scott from Hoppog brings up a good point.  Who says ow?  That's how badly it hurts when he attains you to say the word. 
[00:27:00]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ouch.  Exclamation point.  Ow.  But after the tasering, the students sounded a little different, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I like to make werewolf movies.  He sounds more in control.  Yeah.  Well, here's the cops.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, they apologized.  They did apologize.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Just a bit. 
[00:27:30]  And there was somebody there with this reaction.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh, wow.  No, actually, this is what someone in the crowd was heard saying.  Damn.  You just been pwned.  Oosh.  I like turtles.  All right.  You like turtles.  We get it.  Security escorts him out.  He tells them they can't kill him.  What a...  Can you say the D word for...  A douche?  Yes.  All right.  What a douche.  Get down and listen to the officers, okay? 
[00:28:00]  Do you understand?  Quiet now.  Take a deep breath.  Take a deep breath.  And walk out with these officers.  Can I have my car shoes?  You're going to get everything back.  You need to calm down.  Do you understand?  Am I calling around?  Calm down.  Mic clear?  Push hard.  There are people that know I'm here.  You can't, you can't, like, kill me.  You can't kill me.  Ah, this guy.  There are people that know I'm here.  What does he think?  He gets some kind of a conspiracy?  And then they tried to make it seem like it was his freedom of speech. 
[00:28:30]  Like, they did that because of what he was saying.  Yeah.  Who cares what he was saying?  How much do you hate this guy?  I wish they would have shot him.  They did?  Yeah.  I wish they would have put a gun in his mouth.  Just shoot him right there.  And Bud Dwyer'd him right there.  And then Cherry would have just continued talking while he played with his brains all over.  Dyer.  I got to go back to the actual tasering because we're getting a request from Blue Healer from Kentucky.  So we'll do this for Blue Healer.  Why are they arresting me?  Can someone do something here? 
[00:29:00]  Let me just shoot him.  What did I do?  Get off of you.  Nobody else hit off my desk.  Get the f*** off me, man.  I didn't do anything.  Don't chase me, bro.  Don't chase me.  I didn't do anything.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[00:29:30]  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  That's a good one.  Mike, you know, the tasering did seem a bit extreme here.  Yeah.  No.  Let's go to Nick.  It didn't.  Let's go to Nick on Long Island.  Nick, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Listen, I just, I think it's funny that the guy was tased, and he did sound like an idiot,  but this really does boil down to a freedom of speech at you.  Okay, how?  This is exactly what the amendment was written about. 
[00:30:00]  Coming out in a political arena and speaking whatever you want to speak.  And sure, the guy was disruptive, but they went way too far tasing him.  That guy got enough mic time, probably more than anyone else.  He was babbling at that point.  They cut his mic off, not because of his political ideology and what he was saying.  Because he was an ass.  Because he was an ass, and he was just going too long.  They let him ask his questions. 
[00:30:30]  They let him ask his questions.  They weren't giving, he wasn't giving John Kerry a chance to answer his stupid questions.  And then when they cut his mic off and his time was up, they tried to get him away from  the mic and lead him away and out of the room, because then he was being disruptive to other  people.  And when he wouldn't leave and started fighting, and when he got on the ground and he couldn't  cuff him because he wouldn't put his hands behind his back, it's standard operating procedure. 
[00:31:00]  You either tase him or if there's a...  The guy had an agenda, man.  He wasn't there to ask an actual question.  Yeah, he was there to make it about him.  Go screw.  Well, going too long with something, Ben, would mean that you and Opie would have been tased  the other day with a whole techno bit.  Well, we should have been.  Good point, sir.  I don't even disagree with you, sir.  If there was a cop in here with a taser, I would have accepted it.  You know, when you're right, you're right.  All right, maybe the techno bit went a little long, but there was some radio gold in there. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, it's not like this guy just...  What a dick.  This guy didn't just ask this poignant political question.  They went, hey, this guy's fucking the system.  And they tase him.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Zap him quick.  He's on to us.  Any college student that is zapped for doing something like this makes me happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think I'm worth it.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, where's Columbia University?  They just canceled the Minuteman guy after last year.  They shouted him down, wouldn't let him speak.  Yeah, what about his freedom of speech?  The same university that invited the president of Iran and the president of Venezuela to speak 
[00:32:00]  has canceled this Minuteman guy because they think he's racist.  So Columbia's talking about free speech.  This guy wasn't there to ask an actual question.  No.  It was all an act.  He asked three, like, just rambling, stupid questions.  He wasn't letting Carrie answer because that wasn't his agenda.  It was just to make it about him.  He was looking for attention and he got it.  Guy is put under arrest for inciting a riot.  Bro, stop.  You're going to break my arm off.  Stop.  Stop. 
[00:32:30]  Just listen.  And listen.  Where's your ID?  I don't have any ID on me.  I don't have any ID on me.  I don't have any ID on me.  I don't think I needed a wallet for this.  You didn't think you're going to try to.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on a second.  Now the cops are being completely reasonable with him.  They're telling him.  They're asking him to calm down.  They're asking him questions.  I didn't think I'd need a wallet for this.  What?  What does that even mean?  As an American citizen, you should carry around your identification. 
[00:33:00]  For just such an emergency.  You should just carry it around.  Unless you're riding your bike on a pier.  What?  Someone out there got it.  Okay.  I did.  You got to linger longer to get that one.  We're hoping people linger longer.  Carry your stupid ID.  There's a reason the guy didn't carry his ID.  And it was just so he could make this fuss.  This fuss.  He's a fuss budget.  Fuss.  You sounded like an older gentleman when you said that. 
[00:33:30]  Where are your papers?  Thank you, Fast Freddy.  Yeah.  Drudge is reporting the little punk or the little puke admitted it was for the cameras.  Do you even think you're going to incite a riot?  Incite a riot?  I asked him a question.  Why am I under arrest?  Why am I under arrest right now?  Resisting.  Inciting a riot?  Inciting a riot.  Oh, God.  I hate this kid.  You're under arrest for being a whiny douche. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, I hate this guy.  Let's say they're gone.  Okay.  Guy won't give his name.  Tells the onlookers to come and find him.  Final clip here.  Oh, my God.  You're giving me the government.  They're giving me the government.  They're giving me the government.  What does he mean?  Giving me to the government.  I'm afraid to tell you.  Okay.  Then give me your eyes because you don't like it.  I don't want to give you that.  I'm afraid.  I wish he was right.  Look you in as John.  What's up?  What's up?  You know who I am. 
[00:34:30]  Will you please tell people?  Will you please tell people why I'm being arrested today?  Okay?  I didn't do anything.  You're seeing it.  I'll try to find him more.  Thank you.  Thank you.  For everyone that was here today, please, talk to police station.  Ask them where's the guy that was arrested at the protest.  Ask them where's the guy that was arrested at the John Carrier rally.  Okay?  Ask them where I am.  He's back at his mommy's house.  They're going to try and kill me.  They're going to try and kill me.  Oh, I wish he was right.  I wish he did have some inside info and he walks into a room and the X-Files cigarette 
[00:35:00]  smoking man is there to just burn his eyes out.  An X-File reference?  Yes.  Why not?  Nice.  You know, everyone wants to be a star and it's going to get interesting the next few  years because everyone's just trying to figure out their YouTube video.  The YouTube.com video.  Dude, it's all about getting your two minutes, your two and a half minute video on YouTube.  It's starting to get really, really fun.  By the way, Bill from Waterford, he writes, I got the pure joke, Opie. 
[00:35:30]  You should have run from that fake cop.  There you go.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Wow.  There you go.  He lingers.  Goes back.  So there you go.  That's one of the things everyone's talking about today.  Just hate the guy.  Yeah.  He's hateable.  Never met him.  Don't want to.  He's showboating.  Yeah, absolutely.  Being a real hot dog.  Yeah, he's being a hot dog.  Guys, we might have another one.  It is Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday. 
[00:36:00]  Let's go to Kenny in Atlanta.  Kenny, what's up?  Hi.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Kenny.  Well, here's the thing.  My wife sleeps while I'm at work overnight, right?  And I'm home early today.  She's really scared that someone's going to break in every night.  So what I'm going to do is open a window with the security alarm on.  All right.  Just make sure the phone is close to her so we can hear her reaction.  God, the alarm's going to go off?  Yeah, so the guy's going to set the alarm off.  Yeah, so hopefully when she walks out to turn it off, I'm going to come around from the corner and scare the... 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  You're crazy.  A double whammy.  Make sure she doesn't have a heart attack.  If she doesn't come to turn it off fast enough, I'm going to do it myself.  But because it's really, really loud, I don't want everybody to get pissed off of me.  Okay.  But I got everything ready to go, so here we go.  All right.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse.  Wednesday.  There goes the alarm system in Atlanta.  It's Kenny. 
[00:37:00]  Hold on, guys.  Hold on, guys.  Hold on, guys.  Jesus Christ.  She's fucking deaf.  She's probably getting the gun.  Imagine.  Yeah, watch your language.  Yeah, don't curse.  Oh, sorry.  It's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  I don't know. 
[00:37:30]  I don't know if you can hear her.  Damn it.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, I don't know if you can hear her.  Yeah, what'd she say?  She goes, go turn that off.  Beep.  Oh, she cursed?  Yeah, but I don't think you can hear it.  I didn't hear it.  All right.  There you go.  So funny for me.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Kenny.  Well, the guy did it, but.  Not the big payoff we're hoping for, but.  Awful phone technique.  People don't understand. 
[00:38:00]  We don't want to hear.  Here's what we don't want to hear.  We don't want to really hear you.  We don't want to hear.  We want you to set it up.  The implement of what you're waking them up with.  Right.  We want to hear that.  Maybe in the background, but that shouldn't be the primary thing.  We need the phone near the person you're waking up.  So we can hear their reaction.  That's the payoff.  Right.  Well, you can hear her groggy going, you know, turn that off.  Yeah.  You know, good try.  We like trying things live on our show.  Sometimes we succeed, and a lot of times we fail. 
[00:38:30]  But people don't seem to understand where the phone should be.  Right.  It should be by the victim.  Absolutely.  Arrgh.  It's Wake Up Your Roommate Wednesday.  Arrgh.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  And he's talking like a pirate today.  Yeah, why?  Because it's International Talk Like a Pirate Day.  Almost forgot.  So even the production guy has to talk like a pirate. 
[00:39:00]  What an obnoxious show.  All right.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Jesus.  Wow's alive on Pal Talk.  Oh, you know, so are other things.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, my God.  Well, there's Karen underscore John.  And obviously it's John on the camera.  Oh, what the hell is that?  He's in a marble bag. 
[00:39:30]  A banana hammock.  A banana hammock.  Just laying there.  Oh, now he's gone.  All right, good.  What a classic way to lay.  So long.  I ruined it.  And a big high to the women flashing as we go to work today.  Yes.  They're looking for WOW stickers.  Of course, the WOW stickers stand for Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  The lovely ladies.  It's also International Talk Like a Pirate Day. 
[00:40:00]  We got Nick on Long Island.  Nick, what's going on, man?  Yeah, guys.  I went to go see the new pirate movie the other day.  Yeah.  And they wouldn't even let me in because it was rated R.  All right, look.  You guys are going to kill us today.  Oh, no.  You guys are going to kill us.  There's only so many letters you can do that with.  Yeah.  It's R and I.  Did you just challenge the listeners, Jimmy?  I did.  You challenged the listeners.  Dude, what are they going to say?  I mean, I played chess with a pirate.  What else am I going to talk about?  Do you?  Yes.  He said, you're in checkmate-y. 
[00:40:30]  Okay.  I was blindsided by that one.  I was waiting for how the R comes into a chess joke.  Checkmate-y.  Checkmate-y.  Oh, well.  That's just wonderful, Jimmy.  Hey, what do we got on OJ?  What's the latest?  He's going to be charged officially today?  Let's see.  He killed two people.  Well, now they're adding kidnapping to the charges?  Well, any time you bust into some place and don't let people leave, you use words like 
[00:41:00]  sit the F down, don't move, things like that, it's considered kidnapping.  Yeah.  So that's where that kidnapping charge comes in.  It's not like he grabbed the Lindbergh baby and took off somewhere.  But he's got kidnapping charges, weapons charges, robbery, assault.  There's a few charges stacked up there.  I think about six or eight of them. 
[00:41:30]  He's in jail.  No bail.  And we see what happens.  Why no bail?  I don't get it.  I think some people may consider OJ a flight risk.  They may.  They didn't forget?  No, they didn't forget.  They don't forget that type of thing?  A lot of people now saying, people are saying that this is a setup to get OJ back for what  he did years and years ago.  It's been this long, protracted setup.  Is that what it is? 
[00:42:00]  And his attorney is saying that on the outside, it kind of looks bad because it's all out of  context.  Once he presents OJ's case in a reasonable fashion, you'll see that it was nothing.  It's just OJ going in laughing and getting his stuff.  He does not deserve life in prison for this.  I'm sorry.  The graphic just said life in prison, question mark.  He won't get life in prison.  On GMA?  But he does deserve life in prison for this.  Nah.  Because he killed two people.  Yeah.  You know what, though?  The prosecution in L.A. dropped the ball once again and they decided to go with Darden 
[00:42:30]  and Marcia Clark because it's a black male and a white woman and they felt that would  be less threatening to the black people.  They deserve what they got.  They deserve what they got.  Yeah, but does OJ deserve what he got?  Complete freedom from killing two people?  Yeah, but he's got to look at that stupid Fred Goldman mustache for the rest of it.  Everywhere.  If OJ's having sex, Fred Goldman's head pops up out of the covers.  Speaking of that, you hear the latest on Fred Goldman?  Fred Goldman noticed that, I forgot, I think it was a few months ago, he noticed that in 
[00:43:00]  a video that OJ has a really nice Rolex watch and he wants his share of the Rolex watch.  It's a rotix.  If not the whole thing.  It's cheap, I swear.  Yeah.  So he sent his lawyer to court to try to get the Rolex that he saw OJ wearing in a video.  How much money does Fred Goldman have for lawyers?  He has dedicated his life as a father.  To making OJ's life miserable.  The guy's just dedicated his life to, yeah, making OJ's life miserable, tracking him down, 
[00:43:30]  trying to strip him like an abandoned car.  He just wants to take his watches, shoes, everything.  And good.  Good.  OJ should just be chased around by this guy.  This guy is an albatross around OJ's neck.  Good.  Good.  Yeah, absolutely.  Good for Fred Goldman.  Let's say hi to Tom in New York.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Hey.  Jimmy, what's up, buddy? 
[00:44:00]  Hey, man.  How are you?  Hey, I got a joke for you guys.  All right.  I got a joke.  Hey, what does a pirate cat say?  Hold on.  A pirate cat say?  I'm going to guess meow-er.  That's a bear.  Meow-er.  Come on.  That's terrible.  You're wrecking the whole arr thing.  That isn't even close.  Meow-er.  It's got like a little patch over its jack-jack eye.  Jack-jack.  Jack-jack.  Little jack-jack.  You know what jack-jack does a lot? 
[00:44:30]  What?  Purr's.  Oh, I thought you were going to say hopefully sleep on its back with its legs stiffly in  the air.  You know, I would.  No.  Not little jack-jack.  He's been sleepy like that for a week.  No.  Oh, shut up.  He's a little adorable jack-jack.  Not many people know this.  I want a little O&A trivia I want to throw out there that might come up in a future episode.  Might even give away a prize if somebody knows the answer.  But I'll give it away now.  Not many people know this. 
[00:45:00]  But Steve from Bayshore gave me a jack-jack.  Me and my girl.  I don't know who that is.  I know who Steve.  Steve from Bayshore.  You got to be putting me.  Yeah, not many people know that, though.  Not many.  Let's go to Chris in Wisconsin.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Wake my wife up with a glass of ice cold water.  Okay.  Now, so far, hold on there, Chris. 
[00:45:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Did you listen to Anthony?  Because we really want this bit to take off.  A lot of these bits are just stupid.  This one, we feel, has potential.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Once I get in there, I'll put the phone right next to her.  Put the phone right next to her and, yeah, and just throw the ice water on her, I guess.  Okay.  Yeah, and it's hot here in Wisconsin, so she's not wearing too much.  So we're waiting on you.  All right.  Make sure the phone gets close to her.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  I want to get a bedroom now. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  It's Wake Your Wife Up Wednesday.  It is.  Did you say it is?  What's that?  It is.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  All right.  Bit back on.  We're back on.  One of my favorite parts of the bit is, like, the husband wakes the wife up. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  And then she just looks at him like, what?  What are you, an idiot?  She says what it is, and then there's that pause where she realizes she's married an ass.  Yes.  Hey, Chris, right on, man.  You got the bit back on track.  Yep, you guys are awesome.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to L.A.  It's Jim.  Jim, what's going on, man?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  All right.  So a pirate walks into a bar.  Oh, boy.  He's got a big, giant pirate wheel wrapped around his midsection, walks up to the bartender 
[00:47:00]  and the bartender says, hey, what's that big wheel for you?  He says, ah, it's driving me nuts.  Oh, my God.  Why am I laughing?  I got a funny one, too.  Oh.  Very good, Jim.  Yes, Jimmy.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  Do we have time for one more?  It's Mike in New York. 
[00:47:30]  Mike.  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, all right.  How much did the pirate pay for the new set of earrings?  Um, how much?  A buck in a year.  All right.  The real one.  This is so old.  All right.  I'm going to...  Hey, it's international talk like a pirate.  It is.  You got to do something with it.  He should have said it like a pirate, though.  Right.  You screwed it up, dude.  It's not international tell a pirate joke day. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  You could tell the joke if it's in pirate fashion.  Let's go, Ed.  Why do the pirates like Jessica Biel?  Why?  They love her booty.  Booty?  Pirates do love their booty.  This is so stupid.  This is ridiculous.  Let's go to Paul, New Hampshire.  Paul.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Why are pirates so mean?  Why are pirates so mean? 
[00:48:30]  No idea.  They just are.  They just are.  Oh, terrible.  I don't know why, but it's so funny.  It's so stupid.  Who would think savage murderers would become funny in 2007?  People were just brutal, savage murderers.  Arr.  Arr.  Well, it is also Morning Zoo Bit of the Day Wednesday. 
[00:49:00]  I thought that's what part of the pirate thing was.  Or Morning Zoo Bits of the Day Wednesday, depending on how many we want to play today.  Well, of course, the OJ story is huge, so everyone's doing their OJ material on the Morning Zoo shows.  And stupid Scott and Todd, I have no idea why they're still on the radio here in New York City.  Wacky noises. 
[00:49:30]  They got an OJ song that is just terrific.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  This is unbelievable.  You want to explain Morning Zoo Bits of the Day?  Well, they're things, bits that you hear on your Morning Zoo shows.  They're usually sent in by other people.  Sometimes the staff of the Morning Zoo gather together and do them themselves.  But they always have one thing in common.  They always suck. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  They're just bad, hack, hokey, just poorly done.  Not funny.  Yeah, we want to make it perfect.  Not entertaining.  We want to make it perfectly clear that these bits suck.  And it's a good test.  Yeah.  The bit we're about to play, if you actually enjoy it, you might not be listening to the  right radio show.  Yeah, yeah.  This might be the wrong show for you.  This is how we test our listeners. 
[00:50:30]  So, it's Scott and Todd here in New York City.  If you start laughing, please just change the station.  It's Morning Zoo, bit of the day, from Scott and Todd here in New York City.  It's the OJ song.  Electric Shock OJ.  Hey, hey, that's Anthony's song.  Hey, that was mine.  Hey, that was my friggin', I wasn't even in radio.  All right.  Don't give me that, golf.  And don't you worry, we're going back to pirate jokes in a second here.  But first, here's your Morning Zoo bit of the day. 
[00:51:00]  He should be locked up for life.  For what he did with that knife.  He wrote a book on the murder and said how he would hurt her if he had killed his wife.  And now he's back in the headlines.  He's been charged with robbery.  Oh.  He's going to be faithful and stubble.  OJ Simpson's in trouble.  He's a good attorney.  Attorney.  Why did he do?  Hold on.  Two seconds. 
[00:51:30]  I just got to.  I cannot stand me being a song parody smith.  I hate when people fit words into song parodies by putting the accent on the wrong syllable.  It's just to jam.  They're jamming words in there.  Attorney isn't the word.  It isn't attorney.  It is.  He's charged with robbery.  Robbery.  Yeah.  Attorney.  You can't do that.  Charged with robbery. 
[00:52:00]  That is the sign of a horrible song parody.  It means you couldn't come up with something that really fit the way everybody talks.  Attorney.  You can't shoehorn words in like that.  That's the only problem you have with this song.  It's hysterically funny.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  It's lazy song parodying.  Song parodying.  All right. 
[00:52:30]  What?  Are you serious?  Get Renee in here.  What happened?  One of our stupid interns actually likes this song.  No, she doesn't.  I don't believe Renee likes this song.  No.  Now she's running away.  Oh, my God.  Is that the latest picture of Scott and Todd?  Yeah.  All right.  Scott looks like Rip Taylor. 
[00:53:00]  He looks like he should be throwing confetti around.  That's why he should never get a facelift because eventually this is going to happen.  Dude, that looks like Rip Taylor from here.  Yeah, because the rest of his face is still sagging, but the part that he tightened up  can't sag him.  His eyebrows look in perpetual mean phase.  Yeah, yeah.  When you draw a mean cartoon.  Well, he's got cheekbones way up here and everything else is falling like a mudslide.  He's trying to look younger, and yet he's wearing a sweater vest.  A sweater vest.  Why are you wearing a collared shirt and a sweater vest? 
[00:53:30]  Your favorite morning show host should never wear a sweater vest.  No, that's called the outfit of the douche.  Renee, you really like this song?  I don't know why it's catchy.  What?  I don't know why.  It's catchy?  It's catchy.  So is AIDS.  So is a lot of songs.  I don't know.  And why did you have to cover up just to come in here?  Because I'm a giant jerk, and I was eating my Lucky Charms.  Yeah.  And a little marshmallow fell off and got me on my shirt.  Not so lucky.  But you have a white shirt on, so who cares?  Yeah, but it's down here. 
[00:54:00]  It looks stupid.  Was it one of the pink ones?  No, it was a yellow one.  Yellow?  So it looked, ugh.  I know.  How do they know that Renee liked this show?  Because Pat Duffy called her on it.  Of course.  And you used to listen to Z100 before you came here?  I grew up on Z100.  Yeah.  I know.  I know.  But I don't listen to them anymore.  So.  I know.  Attorney?  You like attorney?  Attorney?  And robbery?  Robbery?  The whole.  It's stupid.  I know.  It's really dumb, but. 
[00:54:30]  Of course he would call me on that.  He murdered his wife.  Yeah, it's just.  It's not really.  Wife, life.  Good.  Attorney, robbery.  Robbery.  Yuckery.  Is there another good verse coming up?  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Renee.  Sorry that this is going to be your last day.  Yeah, you don't get the show.  Yeah.  We want people that get the show.  If you think this is funny.  I know.  You're lucky you're hot or you'd be so gone by now.  I think that the only way I've heard of Stace for her at one point in the show today, 
[00:55:00]  denounce this song.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Denounce it.  But we do it in a special way.  Bring in the asparagus.  Denounce it.  Denounce it.  That's one from the old days.  E-Rock got it.  So you got to linger longer.  All right.  Thank you, Renee.  All right.  Back to the song.  She goes.  Yeah.  Enjoy it.  Some dumb hotel heist.  The head blow's on the left.  The head blow's on the left.  The head blow's on the left.  He's the Antichrist.  Antichrist.  Antee.  He's the Antichrist.  Antichrist.  You liked Antee.  Antichrist.  Oh, it's so adorable. 
[00:55:30]  Again, shoehorn those words in.  Antichrist.  What?  Some dumb hotel heist.  No, Jay is through.  He's the Antichrist.  If the running back was a horse, he would be glued.  Yeah.  Hey, OJ Simpson.  This might be the time that they lock you away.  The bloody clubs don't matter.  It's about time that they make you pay. 
[00:56:00]  There's a cell for you at the county jail.  And I hope that's just where you go.  You'll be found guilty because this time there's no just lance.  No Judge Lancey Toe.  No Judge Lancey Toe.  What?  I don't even know what the last word was.  There's no Judge Lancey Toe.  Oh, Judge Lance Tito.  Yeah.  Why did he lance?  Why not?  There's no Judge Edo.  Why did he lance?  Because it needed to fit the rhyme scheme.  I don't know.  Ask someone who enjoys the song. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, well, hey, man.  You know, you're an expert on this stuff.  Why Lancey Toe Toe?  Why did he have to say Judge Lancey Toe?  All right.  Now that I...  Yeah.  Wow.  Because I like the whole vibe with it.  I don't like the words or the actual parody of the song.  You know it's not cool to like Blink-182 anymore, right?  I haven't liked Blink-182 for a very long time.  This is like a Blink-182.  You know, you look like a cute alfalfa switzer.  I don't know how that's possible, but it's just, it is. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, okay.  Take that as a compliment.  All right, I will.  Thank you.  We need a pirate joke.  God, help us here.  Well, you know what?  My friend, I actually, I do have a friend who's a pirate.  Oh, do you?  Really?  I do.  I don't want to give his identity up.  All right.  But he was actually enjoying this song.  I heard him.  Yeah?  He was laughing.  Yeah.  He was going, har, har, har, har, har.  Let's go to Kentucky.  It's Nigel.  Nigel, what's up? 
[00:57:30]  How much did the new transmission cost the pirate?  How much did the new transmission cost the pirate?  I know this, but go ahead.  An arm and a leg.  Yeah.  Oh, Tom.  Scott, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah.  What's a pirate's favorite fast food?  Oh.  I don't know.  Wait, wait.  Oh, his phone screwed up right on the punchline. 
[00:58:00]  Wait, do the punchline again.  Arby's.  Oh, Arby's.  Arby's.  As long as you didn't say McDonald's.  All right.  Back to the morning zoo bit of the day from Scott and Todd here in New York City.  It's just terrific.  It's an OJ song.  What's recording?  Oh, I think you made a mistake.  Do you?  Fine, you won't get a break.  No break, no break.  No one believes this story.  Cause this past is so gory.  Won't be like Robert Blake. 
[00:58:30]  Uh, what?  So why did he do some dumb hotel heist?  OJ is through.  Here we go.  He's the Antichrist.  If the running back was a horse, he would be glue.  Hey, OJ Simpson.  This might be the time that they lock you away.  The bloody clubs don't matter.  Do it all day.  It's about time that they make you pay.  There's a cell for you at the county jail. 
[00:59:00]  And I hope that's just where you go.  You'll be found guilty because this time there's no choice.  Let's eat.  Oh, God.  Let's eat.  Oh.  Gonna throw his butt in jail.  And he can't afford the veil.  Wow.  Gonna throw his butt in jail.  Cause no one believes his tail.  Gonna throw his butt in jail.  He's a big fat killer whale.  What?  He's not. 
[00:59:30]  I've got a definition that he's going to prison.  Finally justice will prevail.  Scott and Todd in the morning.  That's how it ends.  That's how it ends.  With the applause after.  Who's applauding that?  That's fantastic.  I would say more of a man.  That's fantastic.  My jaw's dropping.  I was crying.  The lower half of my face is a mudslide at this point.  I like turtles.  Yeah, I like turtles too.  He really is awful.  He looks like he's wearing a burn victim mask. 
[01:00:00]  What a fat douche in a sweater vest.  I've never seen a face where the top half of it looks like he's 32.  And the bottom half looks like he's 62.  Stretched out.  Hey, go back a page.  He's got the bulldog jowls from the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I want the One Pest to call PLJ here in New York City and request the OJ song.  Please do that.  1-800-321-9755.  Just tell them how great that song is and they need to hear it. 
[01:00:30]  Add a show reference in if you can subtly.  Yeah, yeah.  Please do.  All right?  My name's Ramon.  I want to...  Yeah, all right?  Anything.  Old burn victim face.  His face is enragingly awful.  All right.  We need another...  Why wouldn't you just hire someone to be you in a poster?  If you're trying to look young and relevant, why would you put that face in a poster?  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Terrible.  Yes.  So terrible.  It is terrible.  Terrible. 
[01:01:00]  We need another one.  This morning zoo bit of the day thing I really, really enjoy.  So hopefully Sam will find another one.  We could do another Scott and Todd bit.  We could do like the Vacuum of Doom or something like that today.  Vacuum of Doom sounds great.  Oh, it's just terrific.  What do we think of something like that?  It rhymes.  It's kind of mysterious.  I don't know what it is.  By the way, before we say goodbye to Renee here for good, let's not forget that she did  bring this 1982 commercial to the Opie and Anthony show.  See?  We don't forget. 
[01:01:30]  I'm not that bad.  It's a real commercial.  I mean like corny.  Well, this is the gum that goes squirt.  It's an actual commercial from 1982.  There you go.  Renee gave us this.  Hey.  Here it comes.  Fresh enough.  The great refreshing taste sensation.  Here it comes.  Fresh enough.  Make your breath a great temptation.  Here it comes.  Fresh enough. 
[01:02:00]  The gum that goes wild.  Squirt.  The gum that goes squirt.  Fresh enough.  That's really odd that they would do the here it comes.  Yeah.  And then have the gum that goes squirt like that.  Well, I think they meant something different.  Of course they did.  But it's not like it's the 50s where they didn't understand.  Like in the 50s, they would say all kinds of stuff.  Yeah.  It was the 50s and now it's funny.  That was 82.  That was actually, freshen up gum was called gum. 
[01:02:30]  It rhymes with gum.  Dumb gum?  Dumb gum.  Yes.  It was called that.  Dumb gum.  That's what you used to call it.  Like freshen up.  Because it would.  It would just squirt in your mouth.  Imagine how you get freshened up on your lower back.  In your hair. 
[01:03:00]  Let's say hi to Cosmo in Jersey.  Cosmo.  Hello.  Hey, Cosmo.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Great.  I'm doing pretty good.  I got a pirate joke for you guys.  I thought so.  Of course you do.  What did the pirate get on his SATs?  Hmm.  No idea.  He got a purr-fect score.  See, now they're just getting silly.  One more.  Let's try Cindy in Buffalo. 
[01:03:30]  Listening on the edge.  Cindy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Cindy.  Good.  What do you get when you cross a pirate and a pedophile?  Hmm.  Ooh.  All right.  That's intriguing.  I don't know what.  Arr, Kelly.  Hey, bravo to Cindy in Buffalo.  Yeah, that's funny.  Hey, speaking of Buffalo, they're asleep at the wheel at the edge.  We're doing this morning zoo bit of the day.  You got to send the whole lobster thing that stupid Larry Norton does. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, God.  Letting the lobster loose.  You want to hear a morning zoo bit that stinks.  And it makes absolutely no sense.  That's the one we want to feature next week.  So someone in Buffalo, help us out.  Help us out.  Okay.  Makes no sense.  Larry, his name is?  Larry Norton.  Larry Norton.  Snorton Norton.  He lets the lobster loose.  But it doesn't make any sense at all.  He promotes it all week, all day Friday, and then he plays a dumb clip from a dumb movie.  From a movie.  And that's his whole bit. 
[01:04:30]  But why does Snorton Norton do that?  Because he's a douche.  Because he's a douche.  Douche.  He's a douche.  Because he's a lazy.  Oops.  Because he's a lazy DJ.  That's what lazy DJs do.  Right.  All right, Renee.  Get lost.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  On the way, man.  This story, as we were preparing.  We like you, Renee.  I shouldn't have said that.  I'm sorry.  She's very nice.  Okay.  I'll try.  Just walk away, Renee. 
[01:05:00]  Just walk away.  Leave the studio, yo.  Could she, maybe Renee could bring another song.  Studio.  Huh?  Maybe Renee could bring another song that she thinks is funny and redeem herself.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  I'm sure she has a sense of humor.  There's something else.  Yeah, find.  This is, yeah.  This is your new bit.  Bring in something that you find funny.  Hmm.  I want to know what you find funny besides that piece of crap.  Because you know you laughed at it the first time. 
[01:05:30]  She probably was like, so bring something else in.  You find funny.  Every time I try and think about finding something funny, I go on every website possible.  And we already did it.  We already covered it.  Covered it a long time ago.  Did something.  Got to dig.  Yeah.  I'm trying so hard.  I'm looking every day.  Yeah.  Oh, there could be something.  I will.  I will do my best.  Give it a shot.  I will do my best.  Thank you.  And no help from Pat Duffy or any of the other clowns that you hang out with and gossip 
[01:06:00]  all morning with.  They do gossip.  Oh, they just sit around and gossip.  That are clamoring over her.  They're all trying to figure out how they could, you know.  Trying to get with her.  I don't know.  Get with her.  Trying to garner her attention.  When you're here, I see a lot more attention in that little room that you guys hang in.  Really?  Yes.  What attention do you see that I don't?  They all want it to get in you.  The booty.  The booty R. 
[01:06:30]  Are they all competing with her hand?  Yes.  Well, when Renee's in, we like to say it sounds like radio camp in here.  Radio camp.  Everybody's laughing.  It's just like you can just hear down the hall.  Everybody's trying to make her laugh and like giggle.  They give you a lot of attention.  Who's the worst offender?  Who changes their demeanor the most?  Renee, you'll probably be able to feel that one.  Yeah.  Well, she doesn't see them when they're not like around you.  No, because you know what?  I don't want to get called out again. 
[01:07:00]  Why not?  No.  One of these guys have to know, like one of the guys that work for us, have to know which  intern kind of changes the most.  You wouldn't really notice because you don't see them when they're not around you.  Good point.  Right.  Which is kind of hard to do.  Right.  But yeah, when they're around you, they're kind of clamoring.  I would love to know what they say behind my back.  Oh, well.  Who wouldn't?  You know.  Who wouldn't?  All right.  We'll figure that out.  You just gave us an idea.  All right.  Travis.  Sounds good.  I'll try to find something for you. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  Travis has spoken.  Now go fetch us something.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Good job.  Ah, what a morning.  Opie and Anthony here.  Thanks for the participation.  You got the women on Pal Talk Wowing for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Getting great suggestions on the instant feedback.  You can get to the instant feedback through the website.  Hopefully K-Rock here in New York has a link to the instant feedback as well. 
[01:08:00]  Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  That's been a success today.  Definitely.  My favorite so far is the guy who woke up his wife at the blowtorch.  Blowtorch, because that's original.  That was awesome.  Also, Morning Zoo Bit of the Day Wednesday is definitely successful today.  Jimmy wants us to play another one.  Yeah, because Renee thought it was funny.  I mean, she heard it.  I haven't heard it, but according to Renee, it's hilarious.  So, I say that we give it a shot, because she couldn't have two awful ones in a row. 
[01:08:30]  No.  Well, Morning Zoo Bit of the Day.  We gather these bits from these awful morning shows across America, and we give them a nice  little highlight.  Isn't that nice of us?  Yeah, we shine the spotlight on their awfulness.  On the crap.  The big pile.  And we don't have to work as hard.  Let's be honest with each other.  Of course. 
[01:09:00]  Another Scott and Todd bit from New York City.  They've been on the radio for, what, 16 years with this crap?  My God.  Wow, why do we try so hard?  16 years playing this crap.  This is the one Jimmy wants to hear.  Well, that was not playing me.  Renee said that this was...  Top notch.  And I quote...  Top notch.  Hilarious.  Hilarious. 
[01:09:30]  Hilarious.  Can you do it in Blink-182 style, please?  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Well, it's Arnold on Broadway, everybody.  Because if you do a morning zoo, you really got to focus on that Arnold Schwarzenegger impression.  You know, the only time you should do an Arnold impression is when you're goofing on the actual guy.  Arnold impression. 
[01:10:00]  Arnold impression.  Or if you sound like Arnold.  That's a good time to do it.  If you sound like Arnold when you do it.  Well, that's true, too.  Hey.  That's a plus.  Hey, he sounds like Arnold during this clip.  I'm not saying he doesn't.  I'm only saying that, like, because I do a decent Arnold.  I don't do...  Oh.  Can we hear it?  Yeah, I...  Yeah, Jimmy, please.  I'll say this.  No.  My Arnold is good.  It's not great.  Okay.  Let's hear it.  I am the Terminator.  I am the Terminator.  Oh, wow.  Wow, Jimmy.  Inspector Clouseau.  They may.  Oh, okay. 
[01:10:30]  I am...  Let me try one.  Now we are going to do something extremely fun.  Hey, that's really good.  Thank you.  Yeah.  That was really good.  Let me try one.  I like turtles.  Oh.  It didn't really sound like him.  I tried, though.  Look, I'm going to be angry.  I'm going to yell.  Okay.  You lack discipline.  See?  All right.  That's how you do it.  I'll do mine.  You lack discipline. 
[01:11:00]  No, it's like this.  You lack discipline.  You lack discipline.  You lack discipline.  You lack discipline.  You lack discipline.  All right.  You're losing it.  All right.  Can we get this out of the way?  Out of the way?  It's Arnold on Broadway.  Another awful Morning Zoo bit, because it is Morning Zoo bit of the day Wednesday.  The World Stage.  The Great White Way.  Broadway.  And coming soon to The King and I, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Now, for the first time ever, you can hear Arnold's actual audition. 
[01:11:30]  Okay, Arnold, you're Daddy Warbucks.  This little adopted wench comes into your house with her mangy dog.  At first, you hate her, but then there is love.  Cue the music and action.  I'll rip off your head, little girl.  Squish your puny melon like a sausage.  I'll shoot your dog.  No, no, no, no.  Cut, cut, cut.  Shoot your dog, Arnie.  You're way up here. 
[01:12:00]  I can't.  You're loving.  Schwarzenegger auditions for Broadway.  I'll be balcony.  I'll be balcony.  Oh, God, look, look, look.  I'll be balcony.  My arms just got all goose bumpy.  Oh, you don't get it.  I'll be balcony.  Instead of back.  He said, I'll be back.  Oh, oh, oh.  I'll be back.  Holy God.  Sixteen effing years of that.  Of that. 
[01:12:30]  Old, old basset hound burn victim jowls.  He probably laughed it up, although he couldn't tell, but his non-moving face.  Oh, wow.  That was pretty bad.  We have another guy that wants to wake up his spouse.  All right.  I'm hanging up on pirate jokes for now because it is Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  It's Eric in Virginia.  Eric.  Good morning.  Hey.  Okay, what do you want to do?  Yeah, what do you want to do?  Actually, I just came out of PT.  I'm in the military.  She's out in the cold.  She's a heavy sleeper.  I'm just going to yell in her face. 
[01:13:00]  You're just going to get right in her face and yell?  Make sure the phone's close to her so we can hear her reaction.  Yeah, turn the phone toward her mouth and then yell in her face.  Okay.  Okay.  Here we go.  Wake up your spouse.  Wake up!  Get up!  Wake your eyes up!  Come on!  Get out of bed!  Why are you yelling at me?  Get out of bed!  I was home for PT!  Okay, she ain't too crabby, I guess. 
[01:13:30]  She's giggling.  That's kind of funny.  Why are you yelling at me?  She's not even scared.  She's not even going to.  She's going to punch you.  Hey, you know what?  I give that a B.  That's all right.  Yeah, I liked her initial reaction.  Very good, Eric.  Thank you.  She says hi, everybody.  All right.  I am the werewolf!  Yes, of course you are.  You are the werewolf.  The werewolf.  All right.  We were trying to get to this before the break.  We're just sitting around the office, and a cute little story comes on the news. 
[01:14:00]  Man busted videotaping women in public bathrooms.  Yeah.  This guy's real subtle.  This is the most twisted crime, man.  I mean, should the women be scared of creeps like this?  No.  No, they don't seem like the type that do anything more than this, but they are just  creeps that ought to just have the camera busted over their head.  How do you get off doing this type of thing?  I think it's the danger in it.  But they're not in a flattering position. 
[01:14:30]  He was in a stall.  What?  On the toity?  Yes!  That could be kind of sexy.  Yes!  Are you kidding me?  The girl sitting on the toity.  That's sexy to you?  Not going number deuce.  I'm talking about, and not even going, but just kind of how they look sitting there.  I agree.  With their little knees touching together.  And even going.  With the panties at mid-thigh.  Yeah, yeah.  Tee-hee.  You don't find that kind of taboo? 
[01:15:00]  No.  It's sort of hot.  Now, what was that old commercial where the chick was on the bowl?  Candies?  Yeah.  What are candles?  It's supposed to be really hot.  Oh, and yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  It was, what's her name?  Sexy.  Yeah.  She's with Jim Carrey now.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Jenny McCarthy.  Jenny McCarthy's on the bowl.  Yeah, it's an ad for candies.  I see nothing sexy about that.  I really don't.  The panties there, no?  Oh, the panties, yeah, sure.  But then the bowl.  I mean, there's nothing sexy about the bowl.  She stands up.  She's got the ring imprint on her butt.  It's like a bullseye. 
[01:15:30]  A butt hickey.  Giant roids.  Sitting there for three hours looking at failed scripts of her own awful show.  Well, library worker taped women in park bathroom.  It's the ultimate violation of privacy.  A library worker is accused of secretly videotaping women in a park bathroom in Colts Neck.  It happened in this women's restroom.  It happened.  A Colts Neck park popular with moms and their children. 
[01:16:00]  Police say a woman in the bathroom yesterday caught this man, Richard Woodsyk, with a camera,  literally videotaping her from under the stall next door.  It's a little creepy, yeah.  I mean, we use this park all the time.  I think this is outrageous.  Anyone could walk in there.  Is his last name Woodsyk?  Yeah, Richard Woodsyk.  Woodsyk.  His wood is sick.  Yeah, there's no way you can get a camera under the stall.  Now, this is the same little divider in the stall where you tap your foot and see somebody 
[01:16:30]  tapping their foot.  How do you then take a camera and shove it under there so you can get a picture of whoever's  on the ball and them not notice?  Yeah.  It's not like you really need that much peripheral vision to see something coming underneath the  stall at you.  Authorities say after noticing the...  You have to be in the bathroom for the rest of the store.  You hear the echo?  Reports coming in. 
[01:17:00]  He got busted when the boom mic crept into frame.  Big fuzzy boom mic comes in.  When he asked her, when she heard, he went, all right, we have speed.  Yeah, speed and action.  Authorities say after noticing the camera in the next stall, the woman was able to follow  the man out and get his license plate number.  She had a description of the person and called 911.  Idiots go right to their car. 
[01:17:30]  On Route 537 and say they're trying to identify two other women on the tape who would have  been in the restroom between 11 and 2 yesterday.  Just poking the camera underneath?  Yeah.  I'm trying to think of a...  Like, I'm actually sitting here trying to think of a way to do that that wouldn't get  you in trouble.  That would be a little safer.  It's impossible.  I would think...  No, it's not impossible.  When you're in the stall, I just look down.  Here you go.  Here's what you do.  You go into the bathroom. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, boy.  You take a maybe four by four inch mirror and you glue it onto the ceiling above the  stall you want to videotape.  Now you sit in there and you just tape into the mirror and get the reflection.  They can see you too, though, I'm sure.  If they look up.  Yeah, but they'll lie.  It's easier than looking down.  There's got to be a better way.  It's called Toilet Cam Rookie.  Oh, okay.  And what they do is they put up a little camera by the toilet and you can watch. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, well, you need a micro cam or something.  Yeah, those cameras are getting small these days.  You could do a much discussed shoving an old VHS camcorder underneath there.  I think that's terrible since we've been coming here for about three months almost every day.  So we may be on his little camera.  Woodcick, a 34-year-old who works in the library of Brookdale College, has been charged  with one count of invasion of privacy, a third-degree crime that carries up to a five-year  prison sentence.  Park officials say they're not adding more security because this is an isolated incident. 
[01:19:00]  This is a very safe, well-managed park.  Still, those who use the park say they'll be looking over their stalls the next time they  use this restroom.  Well, police are investigating to see if there were other incidents.  In the meantime, Brookdale College officials say they are looking at this computer to see  if there are any incriminating files.  Blind school.  What?  Just go to the blind school. 
[01:19:30]  And you pretty much just open the door and start filming.  Roll them.  Or blind.  Yeah.  Their ears are so good, though.  Those creepy bat ears that blind people have.  They'd hear the camera rolling.  Of course they would.  Yeah.  Who's taping me?  Blind people give me the willies.  The willies.  Blind people are creeps because they have that bad hearing.  They have super senses.  Yeah.  They could smell stuff.  There's a fly in the room breathing.  I can hear it. 
[01:20:00]  What?  By the way.  Bad ears?  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  He writes, he got caught when he yelled out, quiet in the stall before filming.  Or after he heard the plop, he said, can I have one more for safety?  That is hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  A little observation.  The instant feedback.  You know, most of the instant feedbackers realize that Stephen S. from Bayshore gets 
[01:20:30]  a lot of attention on this show.  So they're changing their names to Stephen R., Stephen T., Stephen U., Stephen V.  Excuse me, can I have 30 seconds of quiet for a room tone?  Pull two inside?  No, it's good.  What, no one's filmed commercials before?  Well, not really.  Maybe about 20 people listening right now. 
[01:21:00]  Room tone.  Excuse me, there are eraser shavings on this paper.  I heard them.  Oh, bad ears.  Stupid blind people.  Bad ears.  Bad ears.  Old bad ears.  I heard that.  Blind people should just hang upside down in their apartment and listen to everything.  I'm listening to a radio.  It's on in a building across the street.  Ammonia urine. 
[01:21:30]  All right.  We got Carrie from Florida.  Carrie?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're going to cut our losses.  Let me set this up.  You caught someone watching you.  That's all you need to say.  Okay.  Yes.  And?  And, well, I just looked up and there's this guy just staring at me through the little slit in the door.  And it, like, took a second to realize I was looking at him and he just sort of turned around and left the bathroom. 
[01:22:00]  It was so strange.  Like the gap between the door and the stall itself?  He was just peering in there?  Well, I just, yeah, he was just looking in because I was standing at the floor and I saw feet facing the stall.  And I was like, why are they facing the stall?  Tootsies.  And I look up and I'm like, whoa.  You know, I would assume the women out there, they just find this kind of, like, kind of creepy. 
[01:22:30]  But, well, you're not, like, creeped out, though.  You're not, like, scared.  You're just like, what a creep.  Right?  Yeah.  I was like, wow.  Like, we get these subway flashers here in New York City and we've talked to some of the women and they're like, yeah, we're not scared.  We're just like, what a creep.  Yeah.  It's almost kind of funny.  Like, wow.  There's a humor to it, right?  Yeah.  But, I mean, I knew him from, he was on the soccer team.  Like, he was, like, this, like, really popular guy that I had even spoken to a couple times. 
[01:23:00]  Oh.  Right.  Yeah.  There's a catch.  Hey, I followed a very hot chick into a bathroom once.  After she went to the bathroom, I was in after.  I didn't follow her into the bathroom.  We were shooting.  Vanessa Manilo.  Yeah.  Went right before me.  Nothing, though, unfortunately.  No.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  She used it before I didn't.  All right, Gary.  Thank you.  There's a whistle.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  It was great.  Oh, yeah.  Ask Dan about filming a commercial.  Oh, right.  It was blown for him. 
[01:23:30]  Sorry.  That's Booby Man from Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Yeah, we remember that.  You got to linger longer.  Sorry.  Linger longer for that one, folks.  White guy number three.  What's morning show?  Beth.  Wednesday.  Hell no to H-U-A.  Oh, hell no.  Hey, that's all right.  Way to go, Tim.  Yeah, it's morning zoo bits of the day. 
[01:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  We got one more to play.  Well, no, we'll probably play a few more today.  Of course we will.  We got Motel 666 on the way.  Oh, gosh.  I wonder where that'll go.  Motel 666.  I have no idea where that's going to go.  Motel 666?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, it's probably devilishly funny.  Oh, I get it.  Whoa.  Hysterical.  Let's go to Casey in Philly.  Casey. 
[01:24:30]  Love you guys.  Love the show.  How are you this morning?  Good.  Who will be a pirate's least favorite Van Halen singer?  Wait.  I know it.  Oh, boy.  Jeez.  I know it.  God, this is a little obvious there.  No, no.  I know it.  David Lee.  Gary Sharon.  Sammy Hagar.  We know.  That's not funny.  We know.  We know.  We got it.  Because of you, we just.  Thank you.  That will be the last pirate joke for today.  Jesus, thanks a lot.  We really jumped the shark. 
[01:25:00]  We know.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  What do we think?  Um.  Well.  Oh.  Awkward.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  877-212-ON-A.  A lot of complaints.  Awkward walk with the cuffs.  He's coming down the steps.  Well, he has the awful walk.  I've got bad hips and knees.  He still looks great. 
[01:25:30]  I mean, we learned, what, he's 60 years old, OJ?  But he's got the bad hips and the bad knees and everything else from the football.  So he's a wreck.  Mm-hmm.  How many times can he walk cuffed like that?  It's kind of hard to walk cuffed.  Oh, they're showing what his cell looks like and what clothes he's wearing.  Going electric shock, OJ.  Hey, that was my first big hit.  We'll play that tomorrow so it doesn't get confused with the morning zoo bit of the day.  Right.  It could very easily, believe me. 
[01:26:00]  And I'm making fun.  I was the one that thought it was great, so.  And it was back then.  And I still think it's a good song.  You know, you couldn't realistically play an Uncle Miltie TV show every week and have  it be a hit in this day and age.  Let's see what George Burns thinks.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, George Baines.  If you don't like what you see here.  Can you do George Burns on Broadway? 
[01:26:30]  No.  All right.  What do you guys want to do?  We got more pirate jokes coming in.  We got the techno remixes that the listeners are making.  Yep.  You know, playing off the fact that we did the techno fart remix the other day.  Yeah, they all sound the same, the techno songs.  So why not just throw in clips from the show?  Right.  I think they'd be a big hit in the club.  We could play Coke Logic. 
[01:27:00]  And then, of course, we do have another morning Zoom bit of the day.  This is a scarier one, though.  I don't know if I like this one.  I found just the title to be a bit frightening.  It is scary.  We'll get to that in a second.  And also, we got audio.  One of my favorite shows is Beauty and the Geek.  It's back.  You got just ridiculously hot women hanging out with the geeks.  And last night on the premiere, we meet David, who's a LARPer.  And we love LARPers on this radio show.  LARPer.  So we need to play some of that audio today as well. 
[01:27:30]  Those are a live-action role-playing.  And Kevin from Bayshore, Connecticut, because he's trying to get his instant feedback read.  So he's now Kevin from Bayshore, Connecticut.  See, you weren't listening earlier, and people are changing their names to Stephen R., Stephen T., Stephen U.  They just want to get through.  Stephen what?  What was the first one?  Stephen R. instead of Stephen S.  Oh, R.  Sorry, Jimmy.  R.  Stephen R.  It's International Talk Like a Pirate Day.  And it's also the birthday of the smiley face. 
[01:28:00]  Happy 25th birthday to the smiley face.  Kevin from Bayshore, Connecticut, writes, Opie needs a ruling.  See?  He lingers longer.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, here's Coke Logic doing one of those techno remixes that has something to do with the radio show.  We'll see you next time. 
[01:28:30]  I bring nothing to the table.  I bring nothing to the table.  PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH. 
[01:29:00]  She pointed out that Deliver Us from Eva, it's her bit now on Pal Talk. 
[01:29:30]  She's got the glow stick every time we play the techno remix.  Yeah.  She found a little bit for herself.  She's got her glow stick ready.  She's raving.  And when we play these techno things, she starts rocking the glow stick.  So I just want to acknowledge that today.  The other women should, you know, get topless and work their glow sticks as well.  Because it's whipping out Wednesday.  I love that.  We're just confusing everybody with all our jokes.  I know.  It's getting so confusing.  There's so many things to do.  Well, because now we're starting techno wars because there you go. 
[01:30:00]  She's top lesson.  She's ready to work her glow stick.  Oh, and a glow stick.  And that is a nice wow.  Those are, I'm going to go 36.  I might have to squeeze out a double D for her.  I say 38 F.  38 F?  No, no, you're right.  36 double D.  I got a thumbs up on my 36 double Ds.  Drew Boogie.  Yes, the tech wars have begun.  Yep.  This is what Drew Boogie sent in overnight. 
[01:30:30]  Sounds epic.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Body rock.  Body, body, body, rock.  Body, body, body.  Body, body, body, body, body, body, body, rock. 
[01:31:00]  Bum, bum, bum.  Darn, darn.  Bum, bum, bum.  Buss, buss.  Ow.  Damn.  You've just been pwned.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Goodness gracious.  I like to make real world movies. 
[01:31:30]  Movies.  Oh, ow.  Oh, ow.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  E, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e.  Oh, my.  E, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e, e.  Damn.  Puss.  Damn.  You've just been pwned. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, my, my, my.  Puss.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Puss.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  That was good. 
[01:32:30]  Wow.  You know what?  The tech wars are off.  The techno wars are off.  Well, Drew Boogie is the professional.  Is that Drew?  Yeah.  That figures.  Yeah.  That figures.  You can send yours in.  That's really good, man.  You can send yours in, but after that one, I don't know.  That is damn good.  That was a good one.  I was listening to it like that.  That's really decent.  I didn't know it was Drew.  Oh, yeah.  All right, so now we can move on to another Morning Zoo bit of the day.  Oh, I don't like this one.  Or we could meet David from Beauty and the Geek last night. 
[01:33:00]  What to do?  What to do?  He's the LARPer.  Yeah, let's go with this.  LARPers are, and I've played many a role-playing game on the computer.  I like EverQuest, EverQuest 2, Star Wars Galaxies.  Played a few of them.  You do dress like a wizard every once in a while.  Occasionally been known to dress as a wizard.  And a pirate.  No, I was never a pirate.  I was a Renaissance man. 
[01:33:30]  I don't know.  You look like a pirate to me.  I was a Renaissance guy.  I'm a pirate.  I don't know.  I'm dressed like a pirate.  Jimmy, doesn't he look like a pirate in that picture?  No, look it.  I look like a Renaissance man.  I don't know what I look like there.  This is kind of a puffy pirate shirt.  I want to be a pirate.  I am a tool.  Look at that picture.  Great.  Hold on one second.  Earl in New York.  Earl.  Yo, while you guys were doing your, talking about Scott and Todd, I flipped over to them. 
[01:34:00]  Their morning show bit this morning was, guess the song medley being sung in pirate speak.  Everyone enjoying the, uh, international talk like a pirate day.  Are you kidding?  Can we get that?  That is your morning show bit of the day right there.  Yeah.  Thank you, Earl.  You're welcome.  What song is this? 
[01:34:30]  Arr, I've had me some facelifts.  Me looks like a burn victim.  That's so good.  Stupid, frightened eyes.  Oh.  Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of Botox.  Oh, man.  Arr, there's a parrot on me sweater vest shoulder. 
[01:35:00]  You douche.  Oh, 16 effing years.  Oh, it's just horrifying.  Pouring the hell out of New York for 16 effing years, and no one has noticed.  Yo, ho, ho, and a mouthful of, well, you know.  It ain't rum.  Arr.  Is that an eye patch?  No, it's me pubes.  I've had quite a few facelifts. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, go to the website if you want to see them.  A facelift.  Maybe 10 years ago it looked good, but, you know, now everything else that wasn't facelifted  is falling.  Arr.  It's falling hard.  When you look at the website, you think it's the Rocky Dennis and Todd show.  Why did Ben pull the pins out of ye map?  Arr.  Ye treasure map.  You know, if you do a morning show and you do the old publicity shot, you shouldn't look 
[01:36:00]  like an old, like, gay queen with your young gay lover.  You love her.  Right?  With his jowls.  Look at that.  Looks like he's been in the water too long down at Davy Jones' locker.  Arr.  The blind girl felt my face.  It's that head.  He is a giant. 
[01:36:30]  What a fat head he is.  And it's all pulled up tight until you get right below the mouth line, pretty much.  Well, yeah.  Like the nose area.  Right under the nose, because the cheekbones are still high, but everything else is dropping.  He needs those nipped.  They're like, they would be like two big chicken cutlets that would come out of there.  Arr.  Me face has a saddlebag on it.  Arr.  Arr.  Wait a second, and we'll tell you what his face looks like. 
[01:37:00]  Arr.  Yes.  Old scrotum bag.  Hey.  You can't say that.  No, you can't say that Wednesday.  All right, here we go.  So, where were we?  Oh, okay, we meet David the LARPer, yes.  Yeah, LARPing is live action role-playing.  Where you get out there, you dress up like a character from mythical times, and you have  a weapon, and you hit each other with the weapons for various points. 
[01:37:30]  Now, if you've never seen...  Ooh, this is a typical LARPer.  If you've never seen Beauty and the Geek, David is about to do this in front of some of the  hottest women in America.  Young, hot women with all...  And most of them have breast implants.  And they're...  I don't even think they're over the age of 25.  And this is what David decided to do in front of the hot women.  Wow.  What is LARPing?  Or can you...  LARPing is an acronym that stands for live action role-playing.  It's very similar to Dungeons & Dragons, except it's in real life. 
[01:38:00]  It's a culprit.  Better run.  Better run.  Better run.  Better run.  Better run.  Better run.  Better run.  Two damage.  Yeah.  Did he do a two damage there?  It was hard to hear.  I don't know.  I heard some weapons hitting together.  I heard some plastic swords of the gay hitting each other.  Swords of the gay.  And was he throwing beanbags as a spell?  They throw beanbags at each other.  And if it hits you, that is a spell.  It will cast a spell upon you.  You know what bags they should be throwing at each other? 
[01:38:30]  It landed on your nose.  Gotcha.  But we both win, don't we?  My biggest hobby probably is LARPing, which is an acronym that stands for live action role-playing.  In the very recent game, I even played the demon Lord Malgosh.  I, Lord Malgosh, cast the spell of eternal doom at you.  Ooh, scary.  Wow.  I'm scared.  That is, uh...  That is gay. 
[01:39:00]  Lord Malgosh?  We got, uh...  I am Lord Malgosh.  We got audio of the guy he was casting the spell upon.  Oh, okay.  I like turtles.  Oh, wow.  Well, yeah.  He sure cast a moron spell on him.  The spell of the Tard.  It's the turtle shell face and Tard show.  He has a face like a rounded turtle shell with two frightened eyes peering out of the center. 
[01:39:30]  It's just a wreck.  More David than someone's suggesting his name is Lord Nogash.  Wow, I'm looking at a picture of Scott.  It looks like he got stung by a bee in the face. 
[01:40:00]  Look at that.  Whoa!  Dude, what's wrong with him there?  He's just even older there.  Holy mackerel.  It looks like three faces sewn together.  It looks like a bunch of different faces.  Different faces sewn together.  You know who his face looks like?  He looks like the French lady, like, after the dog ate her face off.  Yeah.  He had a face transplant.  That doesn't look like a real face.  That is not real.  Wow.  You gotta stay away from the face masks, man.  He likes to wear a fleshy phantom of the opera mask all the time. 
[01:40:30]  Arr!  We got Stephen S. from Bayshore.  David will never be yelling two damage or any other damage at a girl's...  You know.  I want to keep it clean for the radio.  Yeah.  Here's more David talking about LARPing in front of really hot women.  Crossing over to the beauties, I was carefully writing out a monologue in my head, so I knew  exactly what to say.  Greetings and salutations, fair maidens. 
[01:41:00]  I am Sir Eric, a knight in service to my lead lord, Baron Felix von Hronheim.  Uh, actually, um, my name's David.  One guy that really impressed me was Dave.  What?  He is a LARPer?  Are you ready?  Lay on.  Jasmine vested me in battle, though, uh, to be fair, I did give her the longer sword. 
[01:41:30]  So he's, like, he's...  Text him.  Out of all the things you could do with these hot women that are so dumb, he decides to,  like, have a plastic sword fight with them?  To LARP with them.  And we're not talking about the, you know, the sword of...  You know.  No, not that.  Yeah.  Not the old, uh...  Yeah.  The old, uh, uh, uh, fleshy sword.  He should LARP in, like, Compton.  Bring me to your lord. 
[01:42:00]  Greetings.  That would end quickly.  Sure would.  They cast a spell.  But instead of a beanbag, it's a black fist with rings on it.  Landing gently on your cheek.  Why does my sword smell like duty?  We got, uh, Mike at Albany.  He wants to defend LARPing.  Yes, uh, Mike.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  I like turtles.  Do you?  He likes werewolf movies.  I like turtles.  Turtles. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  Here's David.  Um, he's paired up with this girl, uh, Jasmine.  And David is just disappointed because Jasmine doesn't remember who David is.  Oh.  Well, the third team begins with Jasmine.  Please step to the front.  And we decided to pair Jasmine with David.  When I found out that Jasmine became my partner, I was suddenly worried.  When I first heard David as my partner, I was like, wait, who's David? 
[01:43:00]  Now, what do you guys think?  I think it's good.  I think it'll have fun.  I think it'll be interesting.  Okay.  It'll be fun.  I trusted in Joshua and Shay to match me with my preference, Katie.  And it was when Jasmine became my partner, I thought, oh, dear Lord, I just screwed myself.  All right.  Not much there.  It's more about his LARPing.  Yeah.  Activities.  I like to LARP her.  It's a good show, though.  Beauty and the Geek. 
[01:43:30]  I just had to get some guy that was LARPing off of, uh, off of PalTalk.  Jesus.  What happened?  He had the sword of the gay in his hand.  Oh, no kidding.  Really?  Jesus.  That's the problem with this PalTalk thing.  Yeah.  Occasionally, you'll get a guy.  We're constantly chasing out the sword of the gay.  The sword of the gay.  Ah.  Let's meet Travis.  Another guy named Travis.  Ah.  Is he a girl, too?  Huh?  Is he a girl, too, like ours?  Pretty much.  Okay.  My name's Travis. 
[01:44:00]  I like beer.  It's good for you.  Yeah, I like beer, too.  Oh, Trav.  Oh, jeez.  I like that.  Not only are they retarded, but they like alcohol.  Ah, just dummy them up a little more.  What's the difference?  What's going to hurt?  Yeah, do.  Let's try it.  I'm a juju bead.  Let's try that.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  I like turtles.  I don't think these are the people from the show anymore.  No, of course not.  My name is Travis, and I'm a movie star.  I like turtles. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  Finally.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  Fingernail polish.  I like turtles.  Yeah.  William rules.  William does rule.  We brought back William because we just feel like he hasn't gotten the proper air time  on the Opie and Anthony show.  William deserves a lot more air time.  William is a bit slow, and he's in a wheelchair, and that doesn't stop him from dressing like a  woman and wearing fingernail polish. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  Yes.  Wow.  Did you add these to my thing?  Oof.  I'm a woman trapped in a mongoloid's body.  I'm a woman trapped in a wheelchair.  All right.  Time for a break?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm hungry.  Still?  All I had was the little egg whites and an apple.  I thought that would hold you over.  By the way, Jimmy, a lot of people are asking, how's your relationship going? 
[01:45:30]  Well, I mean, it's...  It's Whip-A-Mouth Wednesday.  Harvey and Anthony just got me wowed.  I just got wowed.  We'd tell you how to get a wow sticker, but we can't plug the website.  Wah, wah, wah.  Arr.  Arr.  Arr.  Oh, wah.  Arr.  I am happy with craving for pancakes. 
[01:46:00]  Just have the stupid pancakes.  I know what it is.  You're driving us all nuts with the pancakes.  Enough about the pancakes.  It's from looking at that stupid Scott and Todd website.  His big...  His flat pancake face is making me want to short snack.  The jowls look like pancakes hanging from his cheeks.  The whole short snack face.  Hey, flapjack cheeks.  It's the flapjack face in Todd's show.  Kenny, go fetch Jimmy some pancakes.  Is that him from when?  1968?  I don't know. 
[01:46:30]  Is it really?  I was kidding.  Oh, my God.  What year is that?  Scott Shannon did some things in this business, but hasn't done much in the last, I don't  know, 10, 12 years.  I'm not saying he might have been a great radio guy.  He looks very British.  I just don't like his face.  And I like the fact that I heard he bad-mouthed my show.  So I'll never like him.  What happened?  Jimmy?  It's just a rumor.  He did?  I heard he gave Lucky Louie a bashing, so I'll never like him.  Really?  That's right.  Really?  Uh-huh.  He didn't find it hilarious.  That's fine, but my feelings were hurt. 
[01:47:00]  Well, we could play more of his Morning Zoo bits that are much funnier than Lucky Louie.  I would like to hear one.  Would you?  Yes.  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  What?  It's Morning Zoo.  I love that.  Can you fix it?  What?  Best line from The Hills Have Eyes.  Yeah.  The remake.  Morning Zoo bit of the day Wednesday.  We're just kind of showcasing some of the horrendous bits that Morning Zoos do on a daily 
[01:47:30]  basis across America.  Today, we're focusing on New York City.  Yes.  We try to play a few from all over the country, but today it's all about the awfulness.  Facelift and Todd.  Let's Morning Show Bethel.  Well, thank you.  Hell no to H-2-O.  On the Ocran and Hellboy Show. 
[01:48:00]  There, there you go.  That's nice.  And, well, they just aired a Britney Spears song because it's all the rage.  Topical.  Lip syncing, dancing horribly, doing drugs, rumor has, in front of her children, being  naked in front of her children.  And now they're saying the latest on her is that random drug testing for Britney Spears.  Wow.  Drug and alcohol testing.  For what?  What does she do that she needs to be drug tested? 
[01:48:30]  So she can keep her kids.  Oh, to be a mom?  To be a mom.  Yeah.  Okay.  By the way, a lot of people asking for, uh...  I like turtles.  Yeah, well, uh, because they want that as a ringtone.  Ringtone.  Hey.  You know the rules.  Monday is ringtone.  Yeah.  Wait.  Monday is ringtone mania Monday?  Something like that?  Free ringtone mania Monday.  Yeah.  Can I, oh, by the way, can I address somebody?  And, and to the, the, uh, the fat-headed nothing that thinks we didn't do certain bits in front 
[01:49:00]  of D.L.  Hughley because we were embarrassed yesterday, I hope you die in a boating accident.  Again, stay out of our motives, stupid.  Who said that?  Just some, just some load.  Some lump.  Who said that, really?  What was it?  Just, I don't know his real name.  Why would I?  He's just a lump and a load.  I don't care if he likes the bits.  What bits didn't we do in front of D.L. Hughley?  I don't know.  They didn't do the hack bits because they were embarrassed by, stop trying to use industry 
[01:49:30]  terminology.  Oh, what?  The whole 80s new wave thing?  We joked about that, that we didn't want to do it in front of him.  Of course we did.  We made fun of ourselves.  It's just, I just wanted you to know.  We didn't avoid it.  We actually made fun of ourselves for doing that.  You're an anonymous lump and I hope you die in a boating accident.  The type that could have been avoided had you been looking.  A lot of people are confused.  They think Todd is the one with the weird facelift.  Oh, no.  So they're calling him Scott and Lard. 
[01:50:00]  No.  And Scott and Tard and all that.  No, Scott is the one that has the bizarre facelift.  It's Lard and Todd.  I'm sure it looked good, you know, who knows, 10 years ago or something like that, but that's  what happens with facelifts.  The rest of the body continues to sag.  Who does he look like?  It's driving me nuts.  He looks like Adam West without his mask on.  No?  A little bit.  A fat Adam West.  I don't know what Adam West looks like.  Actually, he looks like Adam West without the mask on, but the eyes are still on. 
[01:50:30]  From the mask.  From the mask.  Right.  He looks like some sort of a fat puppet.  Like the type of puppet with a clown with a pointy hat on, like from an opera, because  he has the rosiest red cheeks.  He has like red circles on his face.  Oh, just big red circles.  Jimmy.  Scary puppet guy.  Speaking of, you know, you were talking about that Lard that said we didn't do certain  bits in front of DL.  This is really.  He's a loader.  This is what really bothers me about, not most.  Trust me, not most, because my words get all messed up when it's translated to a message 
[01:51:00]  board.  But the DL Hughley segment yesterday was hilarious.  Yeah.  What was the guy that was suggesting that we do?  He gave us about two hours of radio that was really some of the funnier stuff we've done  in a long time.  And then there's always a listener that has to even take something that was obviously  funny for a majority of our listeners and find the negative part about it.  I don't get that.  I get it.  Here's what he is. 
[01:51:30]  He's a load who sits at home and pretends he's somebody else.  That's what he does.  Yeah.  By the way, excellent call, Iraq.  The guy, was that Madam?  It's Whalen, Flowers, and Madam.  He looks like Madam, the big puppet with the scrote chin.  It's the Madam and Todd show.  Wow, that's really bad. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, you know what his face reminds me of, too?  Remember when Lecter put on Pembrey's face?  Oh, yeah, there you go.  That's who he looks like.  He looks like Pembrey.  Pembrey.  I wouldn't have known that Pembrey thing.  The only reason I remember, talk to him, that's Pembrey, damn it.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  So, Morning Zoo bit of the day.  We've been focusing bits of the day.  So, another Scott and Todd.  So, the Britney Spears, you know, all the rage right now.  So, they have a Britney Spears song.  And Sam's telling me it's just as good, translation bad. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  As the OJ song we played a little while ago.  Well, let's take a listen.  Another Morning Zoo bit.  He's a sleazy mother who's been there.  Who laughed at that?  All right, all right, all right.  All right, all right.  Who laughed in the background?  Look.  No.  Was Renee here when they recorded this?  Well, can I tell you something about Scott and Todd?  And E-Rock, who's a student of radio, will back me up. 
[01:53:00]  Todd does everything for the show.  I mean, everything.  Yeah.  And Scott's whole job is to laugh.  To giggle behind it?  No.  You're shaking the head?  It's not Scott laughing.  Oh, so he won't even laugh?  So, he doesn't even laugh?  He can't.  His face won't allow it.  His face won't allow it.  The way he laughs is that his mouth opens and, ah!  That's how Scott laughs.  He's laughing at you, man.  Old porcelain doll face.  Boogie. 
[01:53:30]  Scott Hummel.  Boogie in Richmond.  This is for the people that linger longer.  If your name is Waylon.  That's who's laughing?  Joe Nolan.  Is Joe Nolan that fatso?  He's the beach ball that does their traffic.  Oh, Joe Nolan is a fatso.  I want to have a Joe Nolan.  Get a load of fatso there.  He looks like the thing that crashes through your wall and offers you a refreshment. 
[01:54:00]  Joe Nolan.  The what?  Kool-Aid.  Yeah.  I like to just say that thing.  The big thing.  That scares the crap out of you, thinking you need a refreshment.  There's a given moment.  There's a giant talking pitcher.  Yes.  With a refreshing beverage in it.  Joe Nolan should be frozen to death in a bowling alley.  I despise Joe Nolan.  I need a movie theater.  Joe Nolan. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, bowling alley too, I think.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's start our Joe Nolan bashing.  Not E-Roc's freezer.  No room.  Let's go with the Joe Nolan bit.  Joe Nolan should offer his services to grammar schools everywhere so they can roll him around  the gym.  Remember the giant stupid ball?  Right.  Or the parachute?  We're accepting your Joe Nolan jokes.  Joe Nolan should loan his body to the Hayden Planetarium in case they have to take down 
[01:55:00]  the sun display.  They should just prop him up.  This is the sun if it had a head and legs and arms and a bad suit.  He is indeed a fatso.  Joe Nolan.  Joe Nolan should offer his services to Shea Stadium.  He's a chuckling fat man.  There's nothing worse than a chuckling fat man.  Can we hear that again?  His laugh.  Yes.  He laughs at like, she's a sleazy mother.  She's a sleazy mother. 
[01:55:30]  And then I'm sure they'll fucking, oh, look at me.  Like I said yesterday, my rules yesterday.  Hold on.  Let it go through.  Hey, you can't say that.  I want to apologize, but it is You Can't Say That Wednesday.  And my ruling is, once you get past the U, it's pretty much the word.  And so, yes, I did inadvertently drop the F-bomb.  I want to apologize to anybody that might have heard that and been offended. 
[01:56:00]  Why didn't you laugh at my Mr. Met joke?  I didn't get it.  Oh, Shea Stadium.  I didn't get, you didn't get a good detail.  I don't like to give a lot of details with some of my jokes.  I'm a thinking man's comic.  Like, there's actually a comedian that books himself as that, the thinking man.  Are you kidding?  No, he's on Sirius Radio, I think.  He's like, I think his name is Hofstetter or something.  He's like the thinking man comic.  Some of these things, I like people to try to think about it for a while.  It's like, wait a minute, Shea Stadium. 
[01:56:30]  I'm thinking the big apple that comes out of the hat.  Well, that could work too.  I could be like, all right, forget it.  Here we go.  Let's get back into it because she's a sleazy lover.  Sleazy mother.  Mother.  Oh, mother.  Get it right.  It's not funny the other way.  What?  The big yellow one's Joe Nolan.  Axel Rosenberg from MySpace.  Axel Rosenberg.  The big yellow one.  Oh, boy, here they come. 
[01:57:00]  Joe Nolan jokes.  Mark in Jersey, yes.  Yeah, Joe Nolan is the before for exercise equipment.  All right, enough of the Joe Nolan jokes.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  She's the sleazy mother.  Who's been in a drug-induced taste.  For some mother.  Mind-altering drug at the VF.  Oh, my God.  Mind-altering drug. 
[01:57:30]  Mind-altering drug.  Stop.  Stop.  But it's Mind-altering drug.  It's the worst thing in a parody.  I love that you're pointing this out because now it's going to make this crap funny for people when they hear it on other things.  It is the worst thing you could do.  The biggest crime you can commit in song parody writing is throwing.  It's called shoehorning the words in.  You want it in there.  It doesn't fit. 
[01:58:00]  You're too lazy or uncreative.  You can't figure out another way to do it.  So, you just shoehorn it in by putting the accents in different spots so it doesn't even resemble the word anymore.  Who's been in a drug-induced taste.  Induced taste.  For some mother.  Mind-altering drug at the VMA.  Oh, that annoys me.  He's a sleazy mother.  Her chubby legs look like sausage link. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, sausage.  I'll see you.  Sausage link.  He could be the guiltiest person I've ever heard that writes song parodies.  Yeah.  Of this crime.  Yeah.  Way to pick up on that.  It makes it that much better.  Sausage link.  Who talks like that?  Joe Nolan should be rolling through a cave after Indiana Jones.  Okay, that's good.  There you go, Redding.  All right.  Thank you, Woodfloor Licker. 
[01:59:00]  Joe Nolan equals Mr. Met.  Thank you.  Thank you for helping me out.  And Joe Nolan's hair, when you look at his hair, it's like a perfect Lego person hair.  Lego hair.  His awful, his hair is atrocious.  That picture is old, too, isn't it?  Oh, yeah.  That's when he only weighed about 220.  Fat load Joe Nolan is sitting there with Lego boy hair, and his hand is gently propping  up his cheek like he's thinking.  Yeah.  He's a thinking man's weather laughing douche. 
[01:59:30]  Why are weathermen always fat pigs?  I guess because they know when it's going to be like bad weather so they stay in?  No.  I had nothing.  Boy, of all the endless possibilities, I found none.  I can't believe it.  That joke really bombed.  Really bombed.  Because I didn't have a punchline.  A punchline.  Tom from Philly.  Joe Nolan is the backup apple for Fruit of the Loom ads. 
[02:00:00]  They understudy.  And people are wondering, why didn't they pick a less relevant song for their song parody?  I know, right?  I hate phone scams.  All right.  Here's a funny phone.  Wait, we didn't do Motel 666.  You're right.  We're running out of show.  You're right.  Damn, I had a funny phone.  My daughter ring drug at the VMA.  All the ring drugs.  She's a sleazy mother. 
[02:00:30]  Her chubby legs look like sausage link.  Ugh.  And then her brother.  She forgot how even to lipstick.  She's the kind of girl who looks great.  Oh, girl.  When it's dark and real late.  And she'll let you see it.  Oh, my God.  But no one wants to see it.  See it.  Oh, they're doing a Gregorian chant. 
[02:01:00]  Well, they had to get to the end of that to get it in.  See it.  To see it.  Oh, my God.  One trust, there were two stray cats.  But at home, she's got two rug rats.  One little kitty.  They might be P. Diddy's.  Yeah.  What?  They might be what?  P. Diddy's. 
[02:01:30]  Why?  Well, they're not.  Because they're as white as could be, you dope.  They're white.  There was never any.  There's not even a hint of black in her kids.  Absolutely.  There was never even a story that they weren't.  Well, it's because P. Diddy fit in the lyrics there.  No.  So, so.  Kevin Federline's kids.  And she has saggy.  There's a lot more they could have done.  Yes, yes.  Yes.  They might be P. Diddy.  Yeah.  Her life's in shambles.  It's a master disaster. 
[02:02:00]  Britney looks like her best days in pastor.  She smells like wine.  She's a punchline.  Oh.  At least she is.  She's a sleazy mother whose eyes have bloodshot and her brain's fried.  Her man or brother.  All she's missing is a double plight.  She's a sleazy mother.  She'll sleep with you if you just ask her. 
[02:02:30]  She's like no other.  I just pray that she gets her to fight.  Scott and Todd.  Oh, God.  Of course.  Scott and Todd.  You got to get that in before people hear the end of the song coming in tune out.  Because, God, they need to know where that song was heard.  I want to know why Fat Joe Nolan is just laughing up a storm in the back.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah, ha, fat bitch.  Ah, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:03:00]  Yes, she's a terrible mother.  Yes, that's great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus, Lee.  Can we end Morning Zoo Bitses Wednesday with this fine one and then we'll say goodbye to a bunch of people here.  I like Morning Show Bitses.  This is taking off.  Remember, Buffalo, wake up.  We need the lobster loose thing for next week.  Wake up, Buffalo.  That's Snortin' Norton crap.  Snortin' Norton's big bit. 
[02:03:30]  Bits.  Bitses.  Bitses.  Well, we go to Z100 for the last one of the day.  We do.  I guess we're focusing on New York City today.  Yeah.  This is Motel 666.  6, yeah.  I wonder where it goes.  You can't hear the title.  And I'm thrown.  I have no idea what kind of bit this will be.  Yeah, there's Motel 6's out there.  Yeah.  This is Motel.  You add two more 6's to the name. 
[02:04:00]  And what happens?  I guess it becomes a different motel.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's what I'm thinking over here.  I'll play it.  I'm so curious.  Are you a Satan worshiper?  Oh.  In the town of darkness planning a vacation to hell, Hades, or New Jersey?  That you need to stay at the place that promised.  I got to talk to a dummy.  Hold on a second.  Colleen and Bethpage, what's up?  Hi, how you doing?  Good. 
[02:04:30]  What's up, dummy?  Why are you calling me dummy?  What do you have for the show?  I'm sorry.  I just think P. Diddy's in the song because he's helping produce her.  He's trying to get her out there again.  She keeps trying to hibernate, and now he's the one that's trying to get her out there to get her.  But the line was, it could be P. Diddy's kids.  It could be P. Diddy's kids.  And at this point, everyone has seen P. Diddy's kids, and there's not a hint of blackness in them.  Maybe they're trying to assume that P. Diddy's hooking up with her.  Oh, should we have to really think that hard during that? 
[02:05:00]  But the line was, they could be P. Diddy's kids, meaning they already hooked up and had a couple kids.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  And hence why I'm calling you dumb.  See, then you need to stay at the place that promises to give you a pentagram in every room.  Motel 666.  I love Motel 666 because you can stay the whole week just for the price of your firstborn. 
[02:05:30]  And I just love how roomy the beds are.  They've got Queen, King, and Prince of Darkness size.  I don't get Prince of Darkness size.  How big is that?  How big is that?  Prince of Darkness isn't known to be, like, huge.  No.  Not like a giant.  They're known to be dark.  Evil.  And those people sound, like, reasonable.  They didn't sound crazy or evil.  Why would they be staying at such an evil place? 
[02:06:00]  I don't understand.  I don't know about you, but I'd be frightened to stay in the dentist.  I would be scared if I was a reasonable person like these people sound.  Yeah.  Guys, no Motel 666 location has a pool, but they all give you a blood bath.  A pool and a blood bath.  I'd sell my soul to stay at Motel 666.  Did you?  I loved Motel 666. 
[02:06:30]  My only complaint was that I couldn't find any ice, just buckets of water.  Moose Motel 766.  Oh, because the ice, wait, wait, because the ice, did it melt?  Yeah, because the ice melts because...  Because they're in hell.  Yeah.  And hell's hot.  Right there.  But wouldn't it just, like, instantly evaporate away?  Yeah.  Because it's so hot in hell...  Yeah.  ...that even water would just vaporize.  It really wouldn't have water in hell.  Because if the water didn't vaporize, then hell wouldn't be all that hot, and it wouldn't 
[02:07:00]  be that bad a place.  Yeah.  This is Elvis Durant's crap.  Have an exercise room at Motel 666.  Oh.  We provide you with an exorcism room.  Cool.  So the next time someone tells you to go to hell, why not stay in the next best thing?  Motel 666.  Motel 666. 
[02:07:30]  We get it.  We'll leave the hellfire on for you.  I got one for you.  Motel 666.  Sucks, sucks, sucks.  Yuck.  I can't understand, as an artist, on any level why you would do that.  It isn't funny or interesting.  No.  It's just words.  It stinks.  All right.  We're on to something with the Morning Zoo Bitses of the day. 
[02:08:00]  We developed a couple new bits today, finally.  The Wake Up Your Spouse thing was a huge success today.  I liked it.  Finally, because we've been doing that for weeks, and finally people have come to the  table.  Can't wait to see what people come up with next week on that one.  And if you want to send in your favorite Morning Zoo Bitseses, do so, please.  But next week, we have to let the lobster loose.  That's Snortin' Norton's bit.  Yeah.  And he just goes on and on about it all day, all week. 
[02:08:30]  All day long.  And then at the end, the payoff is just playing a movie clip.  It's an old Bill Murray clip.  I don't know if it's Bill Murray or if it's...  From National Lampoon Radio or something.  I don't know.  I don't even know who it is.  We'll have all the details next week.  All righty.  Brian from Florida.  I hear the sauna is great.  Honk, honk.  I get it, because it would be hot.  They would have a good sauna at Motel 666. 
[02:09:00]  At Motel 666, we suck the humor out of everything.  C.W. Scranton.  I'm laughing, because I can't read your line, David Dave, from the Bronx.  Good one.  Hey, guys, have a great day.  We'll see you soon.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:09:30]  Rock and roll.  Opie and Anthony on your radio doll.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  Opie and Anthony on your radio doll.  On your radio doll.  Hey, I want the rest of the country to hear the DJ that comes on after us here in New York City.  What?  He's from London, man.  Could someone, like, monitor, and as soon as he starts talking, I can do this?  It's from London.  Do you want to pot it up?  Uh, yeah, I'll just pile it up. 
[02:10:00]  That would be odd.  He's got the craziest, craziest, like, voice, man.  I don't know if he's still here.  I don't know if he's still here.  He was being tested on air.  Oh, really?  That hurts.  Oh, okay.  Ouch.  I have, um, oh, that's a good way to start the show.  So, I, um, I have, uh, computer eyes today.  They're all scratchy because I was looking at a giant monitor yesterday.  Because I got to tell you, it's part, that's just part of it. 
[02:10:30]  The other part is a bit of an embarrassing story.  Um, uh, our own Danny, who is a great friend of mine, a good drinking buddy.  For my birthday, he purchased me a universal remote.  Now, I got to tell you, uh, I, I'm not, I, I, I, any universal remote I've ever gotten  has always been kind of like, uh-oh, uh-oh, these things are trouble.  It's always shitty.  Yeah.  But, uh, this one had this special little twist to it.  It's programmable through your computer. 
[02:11:00]  So, I'm like, okay, that sounds good.  So, uh, it's been sitting on my poker table.  And, uh, Danny asked me, probably.  Which, by the way, is your only piece of furniture.  Nah, I have a chair.  Uh, yeah, a couple chairs and a poker table.  A couple chairs, a poker table, and furniture in the dining room piled up.  So, Danny, uh, comes over the other day when we were ready to drive down to, um, uh, the  gig, uh, down there at Camden.  And, um, he's in, in my house, and I realized I had told him when he asked me that I had 
[02:11:30]  indeed used the remote.  And he comes in the house, and now I see the remote sitting on the table, and I'm like,  oh my god, I'm a big, fat liar.  Wait, why?  He's on the table.  Why are you a liar?  Because, because he had asked me, like, beforehand, like, like, a week before or something.  I think it was at the, uh, the Renaissance Fair.  Yeah, yeah, the Renaissance Fair.  He goes, hey, uh, so, uh, how do you like the remote?  And I didn't want to feel like an ass and say that I didn't use it or anything.  So, I was like, oh yeah, it's great.  It's great.  I don't, I don't have to use any of the other remotes. 
[02:12:00]  Wait, is it still in the package?  Oh, dude, not even open.  Ew!  So, he comes in, and he sees it on the table, and I know he saw it, but nothing was said.  So, I'm just sitting there looking at it going, oh, fuck, he had to have seen it.  Oh, you guys have, like, a real genuine friendship.  Dude, dude, I was just, and the reason I said that was just, I didn't want to be a douche, like,  yeah, you got it, and I haven't used it.  Here's what makes you awful.  Okay.  I probably would have lied to him, too, because that's a, I mean, a universal remote's a nice thought, but. 
[02:12:30]  No, it's a real good one.  It's not even a, like, just a universal remote.  There's no way to back out of it.  I can back out of this.  It's a real good one that I won't use.  It is.  No, I, no, this is my quality.  Do you think I'd be telling this story if it didn't have a resolution?  Yes.  Of course you would.  No, it has resolution.  That's the beauty of our show.  Here's the thing.  It wasn't bad that you said, yeah.  It was that you went, I don't use any other remote.  It was that you elaborated.  He forced me to elaborate.  Did you?  Yes, because he's got one. 
[02:13:00]  So, when I said, yeah, he's like, aren't they great?  It's like, you could just use it, and I'm like, yeah.  You know, and then I have to elaborate, not knowing.  And he could have said anything.  Yes.  And you wouldn't have known.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Isn't it great when you press that one button, and baby assholes just fall out like pink  socks?  Yes.  That is great.  It could have been anything.  Yes.  What a feature.  It could have been anything.  But then I find out that he did indeed see it, and that he found out that I was just 
[02:13:30]  lying.  How'd you find out?  When I said that.  My girlfriend.  It's like, Danny said something like, you know, texted her and said, I saw the remote  sit on the table.  Anthony said he had used it.  And then she just, like, texted back, oh, he's lying to you.  He's a liar.  Well, I just thought it was funny, you know, that you had mentioned that.  You're like, yeah, it's great.  I thought the whole thing was funny.  Like, yeah, that is like, and you should have seen me, like, looking at it and looking at 
[02:14:00]  you by the table, and I'm like, oh, fuck, man.  He sees it.  And I told him that I used it.  Wait, did you, what did you say to Anthony?  Did you use the remote, and what did he say?  He was like, oh, yeah, it's great.  He jumped right off and overacted.  Oh, it's fantastic, Mr. Fabasham.  That's a great remote, huh, great remote?  Because, I mean, he must have read at least, like, the footnotes on the box.  I did.  I knew what to say.  I knew exactly what to say. 
[02:14:30]  You know, he at least pretended to know what he was talking about, so it almost seemed like,  oh, yeah, I guess he did use it.  I read up on it, on the box, but then, oh, I didn't turn the sound on for poor pal talk.  Poor bastard, sorry.  But then, as I said, it's got resolution.  Last night, I plug it into the computer, because I passed it by on the table.  Now I'm feeling utter and complete guilt and stupidity.  I feel like a douchebag asshole.  So I see it, and I'm like, you know something? 
[02:15:00]  Let me hook this up and see how this works.  Plugged it in.  Programmed it.  All you've got to do is take your serial numbers off of your electronic things, your model number,  off of your electronics, DVD player, TV, things like that.  They're wherever the fuck they are.  Well, who could, I've got a TV mounted.  How am I going to go to the back and find that?  You look it up online.  Oh.  A model number or something.  Or you just look at it.  Take the sheetrock down behind the wall.  Pull it down.  Yeah.  And then you pop it into the computer, and it knows exactly how it's supposed to work 
[02:15:30]  for the remote.  And I used it last night.  It doesn't rule.  And Danny, I will now be honest with you, and said it does indeed rules.  Really?  You have one remote for everything?  Yeah.  And it's my favorite thing in the world.  It sounds like the stupidest thing, but it does everything I need it to do.  I'm sick of awful shit remotes that don't work, so I finally got a good one that works.  It controls every device in the house.  And the other remotes can teach it.  Yeah.  You can teach it.  Oh, that rocks.  They're going to strangle you someday. 
[02:16:00]  So my remote's going to strangle me?  Yeah.  Something's going to go around.  You know what's good, though?  You don't have to have three remotes on the bed as you're kicking them on the floor.  I have three remotes in my bed.  You want to hear?  This is a good story.  I have three remotes in my bedroom, and in my living room, I have four.  See?  That's crazy.  That's nice.  You got to get this remote.  Listen to the lying sack of shit that is me.  When you finally use it, it works wonders.  I pimped down my stuff.  It's a Logitech. 
[02:16:30]  We'll give him a free plug.  I got that.  The Harmony 880.  You got the flat?  Harmony 880.  You got the flat screen?  Can I see it?  Uh, that's, I think.  No, no.  That's the 1000 or something.  No, that's like the good one.  Yeah, I got that.  That's a super good one.  Thank you, Sights and Sounds in Huntington.  Oh, look at this.  And it's not a plug.  It's not a plug-o I'm paying.  You already have it, yeah.  Wait a minute.  Is there a remote like Ozzy had in the first Osbournes where, like, everything's hooked up?  Yeah, I got that.  Yeah.  It does my lights, my blinds.  Yeah, the lights.  It does, uh, it makes my coffee, starts my car.  That's the one.  That's the one.  Well, that's the one that I got for Ant, but that's the one that Ope's talking about. 
[02:17:00]  Hold on.  I got one of those.  It's on the right.  The left is a cradle.  I got the one you guys got for my bedroom, and then for the living room, I got the big  Mac Daddy.  Yeah.  Flat screen.  So you got the-  Remote.  The shit one you got for Ant.  Now, I want to see the one-  The shit one?  No, no, it's nice.  It's good.  I want to see the one that the Radio Star bought for himself.  The shit one that actually fits in your hand and is comfortable to use?  Right.  Oh, wait a minute.  Okay.  So you don't have a tablet PC in your lap?  I got the flat one where it tells me what's on my iPod.  Does that thing do that?  It doesn't.  Of course not.  I can look at my iPod and see what's on my iPod. 
[02:17:30]  I can start my iPod through my home system, and it'll show my iPod on the remote with  all the songs on it.  Is that a touch screen?  No, it's not.  Oh, that's a piece of shit.  No.  The buttons are on the side.  Oh, wow.  Impressive.  And the things, you know, whatever-  I got a touch screen.  And then you just touch on the side next to where it is on the screen.  I can't find mine in this-  Of course not.  It's fucking-  They don't sell it on this garbage site.  It's probably on a high-tech site.  Where do you go to find Danny's?  Fucking shitremotes.com? 
[02:18:00]  No, it's not shitremotes.com.  I know where to find it.  I know where to find it, E-Rock.  I felt bad enough.  I know where to find it.  But I lied to my Danny.  Wow.  Go to the website, youramillionaire.com.  That's a radio star.  There you go.  There you go.  That's a remote.  Tap.  How big is that?  It's about five feet.  It's actual size.  It's as big as the TV you're using. 
[02:18:30]  Is that big, though?  It can't be that big?  Stop it.  It's a bit large.  You need to use, like, two hands to use that thing.  Yeah, you do need two hands.  Wait, could I use-  Let me ask you.  It looks like a ColecoVision controller.  Nice.  Danny, if I buy this remote, can I use it in two different rooms?  Yeah, because what you do is, it stores up to, like, 15 devices or something, but you set  up by activity.  So you could have activities for both different rooms.  So you could customize what activities that you use in either room, and you could just  simply take the remote back and forth from room to room. 
[02:19:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  It works for anything in your house.  It rules.  Anything that works by remote.  All right.  I like the idea.  The XM remote?  Don't need it.  No?  I got my XM hooked up to my massive remote.  All right.  Enough about the remote.  I like this remote.  Well, I just had to say that because I was feeling so guilty.  That's all good.  The guilt was just-  What do you think?  I saw it sitting there and went, oh, that Anthony, what an asshole.  Yes.  Because I would have.  Yeah, but that's what anybody's going to do in that situation. 
[02:19:30]  I was trying to offer you beer to keep you away from-  Get in the fridge.  There's a beer in there, Danny.  Fetch.  Get a beer.  But he elaborated.  That was the problem.  It wasn't that he lied.  We all would have lied.  Shut up.  It was his enthusiasm.  Yes.  No, I elaborated because Danny, it kind of like elaborated.  It's like you use the remote.  Oh, and I was like, oh, yeah.  And then he's like, aren't they, isn't it great?  It like replaces all. 
[02:20:00]  I was like, yeah, it replaces all of them.  Like, yeah, you just plug it right into the PC.  Into the computer and you just program it.  I knew about it.  Kelly Force from Charlotte, North Carolina.  Mine's a touchscreen with a picture of our doggie on the homepage.  Adorable.  I want to get a universal remote, but I've never had good luck.  All right.  This is a good one, Jim.  Yeah.  I have so many.  It's crazy.  It's nutty.  It's a battery eater, if I might.  All right.  This one comes with a rechargeable base.  Yes.  I never have to buy batteries. 
[02:20:30]  Of course not.  All right.  Enough about the remote.  Love it.  Pat from Madison, Wisconsin.  What happened to the program yesterday?  It cut off during the Hughley interview near the end of the show.  God, you got to linger longer.  I'll give you three options.  It was trickery.  Treachery.  It was XM pulling the plug because they didn't like the language.  Or there was, I need a third option.  There was a power outage. 
[02:21:00]  You need a fourth option, too.  Ron and Fez.  Somebody's unused universal remote.  Enough about the remote!  It wasn't.  It certainly was.  Now it's used.  Not a fingerprint on it.  It smells like new electronics.  You're a douche.  That smell you get when something comes out of the package.  Fucking great.  It's made my life better.  He's such a fucking instigator.  What do you do?  Just hold it in the box and point at the TV?  Go!  Are you still unopened?  You hate that this is over with. 
[02:21:30]  I know.  You hate that it's done.  I just want him to remember one more fact.  Like, that's right.  He did say that.  I'm going to be like Belichick.  It's over.  It's behind us.  I want to move forward.  All right.  I want to move forward.  And that's what we do.  Jess, it looks like.  Jess writes from Kansas City,  Please host a crappy parody song contest.  Who can make the worst one?  It's not a bad idea.  Crappy song parody.  But you have to.  Like that.  You got to follow the morning zoo format. 
[02:22:00]  Shoehorn the words in.  Like it has to sound like something.  Yeah.  Like it would be a good song.  Not like a garbage, just bad music and bad singing.  But a bad song parody.  Yeah.  Production wise, we want it to sound like it's something good.  Shoehorn words in and just make it unfunny.  Doesn't make sense.  It's not a bad idea.  That is good.  Why the fuck is Howie Mandel calling us when he could come in?  I'm wondering if that's a replay.  They're showing all these co-hosts.  I mean, we love Howie Mandel. 
[02:22:30]  Last time he was in here, we had a great time with him.  I don't know if he's lying.  Howie was in L.A.  He was in L.A.  He just did Leno.  He was in L.A., I think.  But what about the replay?  I'm guessing it's pre-taped or replay.  All right.  He's showing all these Regis ghosts.  Is it?  Well, he's taping or they're doing that show.  What?  The show he's blogging, the Deal or No Deal, and that tapes out in L.A., so.  When did he do Leno?  I don't know.  Oh.  So who just said Leno?  Yeah, look.  They got like decorations up and stuff.  Well, Howie was a co-host.  What is he? 
[02:23:00]  This is a repeat, I guess.  Welcome back, Regis.  That was after his heart.  How many fucking repeats are they going to show at this?  Every day is a replay.  What is he doing?  Jesus Christ.  All right, anyway.  Was he going to do a live remote?  I just saw Howie Mandela, and I know he's calling the show today, and we like when he comes  in.  He was great when he was on the show last night.  Yeah.  So what do you think?  Crappy song parody contest?  Yeah, I like it.  I like it, too.  There's a lot of talented listeners out there.  Yep.  Send bad parody songs to Sam. 
[02:23:30]  Sam.  At what?  At foundrymusic.com.  At foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  He'll instantly get a watermark.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then we got this coming in, The Game from South Jersey.  I went with Howard to satellite thinking.  I can listen to O&A on WISP.  Okay.  So then you get-  There's some logic there.  So you get the-  You hear, you can't pay for two satellite companies. 
[02:24:00]  I get it.  Yeah.  People are on budget.  So this person was thinking, all right, I'll get satellite for Howard, and I'll still listen  to my O&A on WISP.  Mm-hmm.  The Game continues.  I can listen to-  Okay.  He is awful.  Howard is awful.  He had a chance to bring the gold with D.L.  Hughley today.  But no, let's talk about Beth and the Hamptons.  I owe you both a huge apology.  I'm stupid and deserve to die. 
[02:24:30]  I have been reading certain things.  Even hardcore fans are just finding it unbearable.  Unlistenable?  Unbearable.  Well, have fun over there.  Whatever.  Once the merger goes through, we're screwed anyway.  I don't know about that.  Yeah, the paper's writing.  I don't know about that.  Dang.  Paper's writing about what, Ope?  I don't know.  We were talking about Mel yesterday.  Mel's-  I don't know where we stand with Mel.  Mel was our boss back in the day. 
[02:25:00]  He pretty much was, I guess, the one that officially fired us for the Sex for Sam thing.  And we haven't talked to him since.  The merger's going through.  It was told to us from some very reliable sources at XM that Mel was going to contact us and tell us not to worry.  That contact was supposed to happen, say to say, six months ago.  Yeah.  And it was supposed to happen within a week.  And within a week passed, and so did six months.  I just think there's issues also about the CEO of that company calling employees of this company. 
[02:25:30]  I think there's a huge problem during the merger trying to go through.  I hope so.  Because if there's a merger, we want to continue, obviously.  Once it happens, maybe, then he would be able to.  It might be very awkward.  Well, morning host Hopi and Anthony were musing Monday whether their XM show will survive if XM and Sirius Merge.  This much is certain.  A lot of shows won't.  Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin says a firm has been hired to identify where the Merge company could save hundreds of millions of dollars. 
[02:26:00]  And you could bet some of those savings are on the air.  Destroy.  Destroy.  Destroy.  I know where you could save $100 million a year.  Clicking around the hallways.  Just burning people up.  Zapping people.  And then I hear tell that Bubba, Bubba, Howie's buddy Bubba the Love Sponge, Fat Clem, isn't very happy over there.  They're trying to go through some negotiations. 
[02:26:30]  And apparently they treat him like shit over there is what he says.  He's not getting the money he wants.  But he's Howard's boy.  Well, apparently Howard is saying.  I guess that didn't work out for you.  Bubba's kissing Howard's ass.  Saying that he's so happy.  And this is exactly what we told Bubba.  So happy.  Through our radio show.  You're kissing Howard's ass and thinking your friends.  Howard's not going to help you.  He doesn't give a shit about you.  And you're just going to get fucked in your fat ass by that guy.  We told you months ago.  Howard cares about Howard.  Period. 
[02:27:00]  Period.  You're playing right into the bullshit.  So you sit there on your fat ass and write blogs about how Howard's the best, love him, and he's been very supportive through this time and everything.  And he's not been.  Because Howard is saying that, well, Bubba, I didn't hire Bubba.  He actually says this.  I didn't hire him.  The company hired him.  And, you know, I hope they can work things out.  But the same thing as how they fucked over Jackie Martling. 
[02:27:30]  How he fucked over Jackie Martling.  Hey, it's the company.  It's not me.  So he sits there making a half a billion dollars.  And his buddy, Bubba, who, you know, is on his channel.  It's Howard and that's it.  And then Bubba sits on his channel and gets no financial support.  No going to the boss and going, hey, I need this guy on my channel.  I'd like that.  Go to bat for him. 
[02:28:00]  Just doesn't happen.  I'm not going to say I'm sad about it.  I don't like Bubba.  Oh, I don't care either.  I could give a flying fuck if the guy never does radio again.  We just find it funny.  I find it hysterical that the guy didn't listen to what we said to people that actually knew that experience.  See, the problem with that fat douchebag is he never worked for the same company as Howard.  He never had to deal with Howard on a one-to-one working relationship with the same boss, the same company. 
[02:28:30]  And he never saw what kind of a guy he was.  We did.  We had that experience.  So he goes in there thinking it's all great.  Everyone's happy.  They go over to satellite.  And then as time goes on, oh, well, you realize you're fucking not his friend.  You're not his fucking loyal co-worker.  He's not going to do anything for you.  And now you sit there struggling, hoping.  Now he's hoping he can get a job in terrestrial. 
[02:29:00]  Well, join the fucking club.  Huh?  What was he saying when we went over there?  Wasn't it that we failed so miserably on satellite that we had to go back to terrestrial?  Yeah.  Isn't that what he was saying?  Yeah.  So what happened?  Bubba, you're failing so badly on satellite that you're looking to get back on terrestrial?  We failed so bad on satellite that we decided to add another million, million and a half list.  Right.  What's good for the goose is good for the elephant.  You fat fuck.  All right. 
[02:29:30]  That's it for that.  Chris in Utah, what's up?  Is it?  Yes!  I didn't think I was done.  Oh, you are?  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I'm done.  All right.  Chris in Utah.  Sorry, buddy.  I'm the only asshole with a wow sticker in Salt Lake City.  Hold on.  I can't hear you because one of the killers from the star chamber just walked in.  Okay.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's good, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Wow.  Thank God I had just recently seen that with my new remote. 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Speaking of remotes.  I didn't mean to watch it.  About the remote.  That's why I turned on the fucking stereo and the TV came on.  Shitdickremotes.com.  Shaking it in the package.  Shaking it in the package.  I love the remote.  It's changing my life.  It's a paperweight.  It's a door jam.  Everything but what you designed it to be, you drunkard.  Let's go to Chris in Utah.  Speaking of remotes. 
[02:30:30]  Yes.  Your birthday embarrassment.  Happy endings was fucking awesome.  What?  Happy endings was awesome.  He don't care.  He's receiving his pancakes.  Pancakes.  All right.  Thank you.  I work for Best Buy in Salt Lake City and that remote is fucking awesome.  Ah.  Thank you, sir.  You called for that, huh?  And it will blow you.  You called for that, huh?  All right.  Let's say hi to Brad in New Jersey.  Brad.  Hey, guys.  Show Utah how to do radio.  Let's go.  Brad. 
[02:31:00]  Let's go, Brad.  I had the misfortune, guys.  I was here in Howard this morning for like 10 friggin' minutes.  And I tell you what.  My wife, who is a devoted listener to him, even she's getting annoyed with him.  Like, she was bitching and moaning yesterday how, or Howard was bitching about Betho and  I guess reading page six about somebody wrote that Howard's going to get cold feet about  getting married.  And even my wife, who's listening to Howard for years, says, who cares?  And who's Betho anyway?  And she's nobody.  It's all about Howard.  She's future Mrs. Howard Stern. 
[02:31:30]  How's Howard's voice?  You know what?  It's funny you say that because I was specifically listening to the sound of the dentures as he  was speaking.  For the teeth like shattering around?  We don't know if he has dentures.  It's been rumored, but we're hearing something different in his voice.  Well, somebody was up in the house and saw a glass with dentures in it in his master bathroom.  And then you listen to some tapes of him or something.  We got that tape again?  Yeah, and it sounds like when somebody's trying to talk around their dentures. 
[02:32:00]  I'd rather listen to Vostok.  It's horrible.  I would just find it funny because back in the day, Howard would make fun of everyone.  Yeah.  Anyone that just wouldn't speak properly.  Whether they had a speech impediment or used the wrong words or didn't pronounce them  properly.  He's not even rather.  He's horrible.  All right.  Bananas on your...  These are healthy pancakes.  What do you have?  Pancakes?  It looks like...  What do you got, Jimmy?  What's in them?  They're healthy pancakes. 
[02:32:30]  They're made like with...  I don't know.  Kenny had a printout of what they are.  Of course he did.  Hold on.  I have a printout.  Does Rene know what they are?  These are the ingredients.  Rene, do you know what these are?  Rene.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Rene.  Did you find them funny?  Yes.  Pancakes are hysterical.  Yeah.  She wrote a little song parody about it.  They're called...  Alexis's Healthiest Blueberry Buckwheat Pancakes.  A blueberry.  All natural, organic, eggless buckwheat pancakes made with high fiber cholesterol free oat milk. 
[02:33:00]  Yuck.  Blueberry.  I'm already...  Yuck.  Oh, I thought these were...  This is like a weird type of a pancake.  It sounds like it tastes like shit.  Well, I'll give you a...  All the good stuff is out of it.  Well, I just...  Eggless.  I want to eat it healthier.  Eggless.  We replaced the eggs with tofu.  How is it, Jim?  I've had better.  It's gotta be awful.  A little dry and mealy and grainy.  You gotta...  I mean, it's all right. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  I want to eat a little healthier.  You know what I hate?  I understand, but if you're gonna have pancakes, you should have pancakes.  No.  Oh, it's remote control kids.  You suck.  They're not gonna leave me alone.  No, I hate commercials where people are walking around at work or outside with a cereal bowl  and a spoon eating cereal.  Why?  That's how you eat cereal.  Like at the workplace.  No, that's how, like, radio people have to eat.  But, like, you wouldn't be... 
[02:34:00]  See, you ever see, like, the construction worker?  There's a new one for some brand flake shit.  Make your shit fucking tighter cereal.  And it's a construction worker on a job site with a bowl in his hand with milk and a cereal.  And he's eating, walking around.  No one fucking does that.  I just had to bring it up.  They should show me.  It annoys the piss out of me.  No, because a lot of other cereal companies are doing that.  And then they try to bullshit us like the employees from fucking Post are out in a... 
[02:34:30]  Not an SUV.  A van.  A big recreational vehicle.  RV.  Handing cereal out to people.  Well, they do, though.  No, they don't.  And they're still wearing their factory clothes.  Dude, they're going around the country in this RV, giving away cereal, with their factory  hair plastic things on, and the Google-eyed woman.  Why don't we make a lot of breakfast cereal?  Do ya? 
[02:35:00]  Stop with the eating cereal outside.  No one does it.  Reading from Wack Bag.  Howard had that guy from Page Six on yesterday, who kisses Howard's ass, by the way.  Richard Johnson.  And Howard said that he didn't have dentures, that it was a mouthpiece he wears when he goes  to bed.  When he goes to bed-y-bye.  Wait, what's that about?  I hope the mouthpiece is a cock.  A mouthpiece.  And someone's asking, Jimmy, how does Joe Nolan's face taste? 
[02:35:30]  What?  Well, it was Scott, not Joe Nolan.  Oh.  No, I got tricked, too, by that false information.  I want to see that construction worker, an hour after he eats his CW Post, drinking a  Miller Lite and shitting into a spackle bucket.  A nice, liquidy breakfast shit into a spackle bucket, because he's hungover.  Yes.  Why is everyone saying, look at Drudge?  What's up on Drudge now?  Let's say hi to Kelly in Wisconsin.  Kelly!  Hey, guys. 
[02:36:00]  I wanted to try to bring back the pirate bit.  Okay.  Who does the pirate like to vote for?  Paul R. Nelson.  All right.  Very good.  I should have known.  It was from Wisconsin there.  Let's go to Dusty in Washington.  Dusty!  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey, get this.  I got stuck in fucking traffic, right?  Yep.  I got stuck next to some asshole listening to Howard Stern on his radio.  Yep.  And, of course, it overpowers my radio. 
[02:36:30]  So, in traffic, I had to listen to Howard Stern instead of you guys, and it pissed me  off.  It ruined my whole fucking day.  Is he good?  Fuck no, he's not good.  He talks to that other bitch on there, and it was totally unentertaining.  I was actually almost ready to turn on terrestrial radio.  You know, he had his day, man.  You know.  Certainly did.  And he's got a great payday now, so, you know, God bless him.  God bless.  But he's not doing, no one's talking about his show anymore, unless we do. 
[02:37:00]  Jason on Long Island.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Listen, the lowdown on Howard's teeth is, he doesn't have dentures.  He has dental veneers.  He had them put on because years ago, as you know, a lot of people know he had OCD.  He would brush his teeth like six times a day.  He wore down his gums.  He had to have dental veneers put on.  Well, that's your, uh, that's what you're saying.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  Uh, yes, E-Rock?  I'm sorry?  What did you say?  I said you can't wear out your gums from brushing your teeth too much. 
[02:37:30]  Um, yes, you can.  Jesus.  The irony is.  The irony is.  You're kidding, right?  What do you know?  I do brush my teeth, Jim.  Dude.  How did you find that out?  Are you kidding?  I wore away one of my gums.  Because you absolutely can.  I got an issue.  Yeah.  With one of my, uh, tooth of his is on the left side.  From brushing too much.  From brushing too much.  I brush, uh, some of the gum away. 
[02:38:00]  Opie has a food pocket.  I do have a food pocket, too, Jimmy.  Yes.  Thanks for letting everyone know that.  All right.  Thank you, uh, Jason.  That's what Jason's saying is, uh, going on there.  We know something's going on with his voice.  Eric, you're on the air.  Howard, I wanted to take a second and tell you, uh, an experience about, uh, Howard TV.  The experience is amazing.  Um, the great thing about Howard TV is that the other night I wasn't feeling well.  Usually I turn it on to go to sleep.  And I come into the... 
[02:38:30]  Wow, we want to hear Howard.  I know.  I just want to hear him talk over his...  By the way, what a bad endorsement.  I usually turn it on to go to sleep.  To go to sleep.  Action-packed.  Good point.  A couple more here.  Let's say hi to Oscar in New Jersey.  Oscar.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Welcome aboard.  Hey.  Quick question for you in regards to 94.1 going to Rock.  94.1 W-I-S-P.  The Rock is back in Philly, yes.  Yeah, well, they got rid of Kid Chris.  He's, like, spinning records now and talking for, like, two minutes. 
[02:39:00]  I'm sure he'll talk more.  Kid Chris is a very, very adaptable radio guy.  A lot of Kid Chris fans are not happy about that.  Yeah.  I've heard that they're slowly but surely going to start dropping records.  They just want to establish the fact that YS-P's back.  There's a bunch of rock stations in town.  And they want to start that whole, you know, radio war again down there.  And they need Kid Chris's cooperation.  And then when they establish the rock, then they're going to have him drop some records  and get his show back going.  They know how successful he is down there and how popular he is down there. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, but so why are they alienating the people that tune in every day for four hours by playing shitty rock?  All right, just ignore the explanation Ope just gave you.  Just ask the same question.  Ope just told you exactly why they're doing that and then it won't last.  Well, it didn't work for me.  It didn't work for me.  I don't like it.  Yeah, I understand.  There's a lot of Kid Chris fans that are not happy.  I personally think they could have still established the rock image and have Kid Chris continue with his show.  Maybe have him play a couple records just to have some rock going on.  But, you know, he's playing nothing but rock and talking for, what, a couple minutes, an hour or something, right? 
[02:40:00]  Sucks.  All right.  Well, that's the explanation, Oscar.  I don't know what else to tell you.  No, I mean, you know, I just, the suits, they're just idiots.  I don't understand why they would do it.  Oh, easy with that talk.  Yeah, man.  You're not going to get an argument from me about the suit thing.  We hate the suits.  All right, Oscar.  Well, that's your explanation, like it or not.  I mean, that's what they're thinking down there in Florida.  All right, man.  Let's say hi to Brian in Buffalo.  Brian? 
[02:40:30]  Ramon, Jimmy's dad's a cuckold.  My dad's a cuckold.  Cuckold.  All right.  This goddamn Jesse Jackson.  I went to Drudge Report.  Oh, okay.  While we were chatting.  And apparently Jesse Jackson has said that he's criticizing presidential hopeful and Illinois  Senator Barack Obama for, quote, acting like he's white. 
[02:41:00]  That's what Jesse Jackson has said.  Why is that okay?  He's a big tip.  He's acting like he's white.  Why the fuck is that okay to say?  And why is that a bad thing?  And why is it, why is he allowed to say it, first of all?  And then you think, oh, he's acting like he's white.  Maybe he's trying to appeal to the entire country.  I'll even throw a Barack Obama, a bone here.  I will say that he's trying to appeal to the entire country. 
[02:41:30]  To a larger, yeah.  That's why Jesse Jackson, during his run for president, and stupid Al Sharpton never get  anywhere because they appeal to their own people, period.  Oh, the whole country is, uh, uh, is not just black, black people.  So you got, you got to appeal to the entire country. 
[02:42:00]  And this is his problem.  Because of the, uh, black, uh, uh, the black guys that were accused, the Jenna Six, they're  calling them, they were arrested on attempted murder charges for beating the shit out of  a, uh, white kid.  And for some reason, black people, uh, black leaders are up in arms that they're in trouble.  Now, if it was six white guys that beat up a black guy, the black leaders would be all 
[02:42:30]  over that case saying, you got to prosecute, this is a hate crime.  But now it's six black guys that beat the shit out of a white guy.  And they're saying that, oh my God, they ought to be let go.  This is racism.  What the fuck is this?  What is this?  One or the other.  Jesse Jackson is a googly eyed cunt.  A goon.  An asshole.  He is an asshole.  How can these guys have any credibility when all they do is completely flip flop on, on 
[02:43:00]  stuff based totally on race?  Listen, they don't have real credibility, but they are.  Somebody in, uh, in, uh, core was telling me this, the Congress of Racial Equality, the  more conservative black organization, that guys like Sharpton and guys like Jesse Jackson  are very safe because they're no real threat.  They're clowns.  Yeah.  They're no real threat.  They get a lot of press.  They do get shit done.  They get people fired, lip service pro, but they're no threat to anything because they 
[02:43:30]  are seen as clowns.  So they're never going to truly win anything.  A guy like Obama is a different guy because he's a guy that could actually win something.  I mean, if you're worried about black people being in power, he's a guy you have to worry  about because he's legitimate.  He's got a legitimate shot.  Of course he does.  And he has like legitimate views on issues and he's, he can debate on issues and talk  about issues and not be racially obsessed, which is, uh, it's a very, if you don't want  black people to win anything for real, Jackson and Sharpton, as loud as they are, are great 
[02:44:00]  guys to have their prime examples.  Yeah.  Of people that aren't going to get anywhere, but you'll look, but they'll always be in  the mix, but they'll never really win because they're clowns.  And like, if you want to look at it like that, those are guys that are, are, and they're,  they're racists.  Of course they are.  They are such racists that they cannot get other people of other races to support them.  Um, white people do not support, uh, Reverend Al Sharpton and his ideology because his ideology 
[02:44:30]  is racist.  It is based in race period.  The guy doesn't care about, about, uh, uh, solving problems or, or injustice.  He cares about the color of people's skin and that's what he's basing everything he does  on.  And so is Jesse Jackson.  Barack Obama is acting like he's white.  Is what Jackson said.  That should be something that, that now Jackson has to turn around and, uh, and fucking apologize  for. 
[02:45:00]  I'd love to see an outrage and go, what does that mean?  He's acting white.  If you said, took a, a, a, a candidate and said, oh, they're acting black, there would be  a fucking riot.  Is Jack, is he acting white?  Why?  Is he a lacrosse player that was falsely accused of raping a black chick?  Yeah.  Is that it?  I'm cunt.  Jesse Jackson said, is he acting like, uh, an innocent, uh, couple?  A white guy and a white girl going out and, uh, getting raped and murdered and getting  his dick cut off and shoved in his mouth by six black people? 
[02:45:30]  You never hear about that.  That you never hear in the news?  Nope.  That has never made the national news?  Christopher something and I forget his girlfriend.  They made her for like three days.  Oh, raped her for three fucking days.  It was one of the most barbaric crimes ever.  Right.  And again, these guys are criminals.  They should be executed.  But you just don't hear about the racial angle.  Yeah.  Because even to minorities, minorities are expected to behave that way.  That's why, that's why in Newark, they're not, why, why is there no protest?  Three black students were executed and a fourth one was shot in the head and lived. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  But it was not by other black people.  It was by other minority group.  Yeah.  So that is acceptable to black people that another minority group would do that and there's  no racial involved.  It's disgusting.  I've, uh.  By the way, this is coming in from Travis.  Blacks don't really want the Genesics to be released.  They just don't think they should have been charged with what they were charged with.  Okay.  So their conviction should be overturned because they were unfairly charged.  There's always got to be a problem.  Please.  So there you go.  Just, just stop. 
[02:46:30]  There's always got to be some fucking problem.  Enough.  I've, I've just been, um, oh, my, I, I, I, I, it's, it's infuriating.  Go to, go to break.com and put in, um, uh, robbery, surveillance, uh, robberies that you  will just sit there and it is a cavalcade of armed robberies and some of the most violent  crimes you will see on surveillance cameras. 
[02:47:00]  And I, I don't know the ifs, ands, buts or whys of it, but 99% of them are black people.  Black guys coming in and just whapping a woman over the head with a, a gallon bottle  right across the head.  Another guy walks in and just cold bloodedly shoots the clerk, uh, behind the counter.  And these videos you can just check out on break.com?  Just watch them all night.  And, and is it at the agenda of break.com that, that they're just putting these videos 
[02:47:30]  on to show, uh, to, to, to like get people, uh, all heated up?  Or are these the ones that are available?  I really want to see more people committing robberies.  More white people.  Well, here's a, a white, uh, clerk.  This, uh, one, I think she just gets.  Here's a white guy.  Punched in the face or something.  Paying for something.  And then the, uh, black guy behind him.  There's somebody behind the white guys.  He's paying for something. 
[02:48:00]  It's just infuriating.  Like a convenience store type of place.  These are issues that really have to be addressed instead of fucking Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton,  uh, trying to.  All right.  White guy.  Trying to get their name in the news.  There's a white guy in.  That's a white guy.  Oh, they're the white guy.  I didn't say there's, they're all, uh, black guys so far.  Oh my God.  What did he just pull out?  Oh, they pull it.  Oh, believe me.  They pull out a bigger machete and chase him down the street. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  So the white guy has, uh, now pulled out a machete, but he's getting the money big knife.  Thanks for proving my point, Iraq, by pulling up the only white guy that robbed the fucking  store.  That was pretty much it.  And the guy's leaving.  What are you doing?  I was trying to watch that.  Why'd you take it off?  Nah, he just gets him with a machete.  Yeah, what are you, a racist?  He leaves with his machete.  He leaves.  I must say, the black guys are really good at it, though.  The white guys always get chased out.  Wait, then the clerk brings, pulls out a bigger machete. 
[02:49:00]  See, she should lop his hand off right there.  Yeah, go for the hand.  As he's reaching over the register.  But then she gives it to a guy.  And then what happens?  And then the guy chases him out.  Chases him out with the bigger machete?  Yeah.  It's no big deal.  This isn't even a good one.  God, Iraq, you suck.  That's important.  You can't even randomly pick a good fucking clip.  It's a guy stealing a pack of Orbit.  There's hundreds of those where all you see are violent shootings and bottles upside the  head and punches in the face.  There's one where this woman, the guy points and goes, could I have one of those? 
[02:49:30]  And she turns her head for a second, this guy punches this woman in the face so fucking  hard, she goes down and is gone.  Just lights out.  All right, we'll check out the videos.  We've got a break.  Just have fun with it.  Put a link up on the website.  Well, I'll say about Jesse Jackson, it is the headline on Drudge, so let's see what happens.  You know what will happen?  Nothing.  Somehow he's fucking royalty in this country. 
[02:50:00]  No one wants to touch him.  But if there's a problem with the radio station, the heads of the radio company will still  sit down with this fuck face and talk to him like he's a legitimate social leader.  This guy.  Oh, just rewind that to the beginning.  Watch the guy comes in and just bop, bop, bop, shoots him.  They're milling about, all ready to rob.  This guy just comes in, bop, bop, shoots him.  Jumps over the counter, shoots him some more.  Wow.  He's dead, right?  Oh, yeah.  No, that guy, he's still alive, believe it or not. 
[02:50:30]  How do you know?  They give you updates on these people?  He comes running out after they all leave.  How many?  And then another guy walks in and the guy's bleeding.  He's shot.  He's trying to walk out the door and the guy walking in goes, give me five on one.  Wait, you can hear audio?  Give me five on one.  He's asking for five dollars on pump number one.  How many guys?  The guy's all shot up.  How many guys were involved in the robbery?  I don't know, like four.  Four of them came in.  Fucking pieces.  But you can hear the audio on these videos?  Yeah, some of them, they have audio. 
[02:51:00]  The one where the woman gets it upside the head with the big bottle of booze, you can  hear the audio.  The screams.  It's a giant bottle.  You gotta find that one.  Okay, let's find some of those as we go to break.  Hey, Drew Boogie, we're gonna play this again.  There's kind of like a techno war thing happening.  The other day, we were doing our techno fart remixes.  Of course we were.  Anthony is just a mix master with the farts.  A mix master.  And the oof.  Oof.  Oof. 
[02:51:30]  So then Coke Logic sent one in yesterday, remixing some of the sounds from the show, and  we got this one in today from Drew Boogie.  Can I raise one point?  Yeah.  Eggless pancakes suck a duke.  Of course they do.  Eggless pancakes.  I feel bad, because Jimmy was craving pancakes all morning, and then he finally went for  it, and look.  He should have just went for the pancakes.  Why don't you get the vaginalist woman?  Because then there's no purpose to it.  Right.  Exactly.  It's like a juiceless vag. 
[02:52:00]  Wait, hold on.  Did I just fucking...  What, I'm the only one?  No, no.  I'm so disgusted with myself that I took your joke...  Yes, sir.  ...and thought I was making a clever joke when all I was doing was stealing and explaining  yours, but without the humor.  What a shithead I am.  You know what you should do with that joke?  Leave it on the kitchen table unwrapped, and then just tell them that you enjoyed it.  You just told an eggless joke.  Yeah.  I just did.  Ladies, get out your glow sticks.  It's Drew Boogie.  All right. 
[02:52:30]  All right.  Push.  Push.  You just been home 
[02:53:00]  Oh my goodness gracious  I like to make  Marvel movies  Movies

[02:54:30]  Give me five  Give me double  Time is up  Not cool  Not cool  We got a big star  That just waited ten minutes  On the phone line  Howie  Hello  Sorry to make you wait  Howie  It's okay buddy  Howie Mandel everyone  From Deal or No Deal  Yes  Thank you  We were talking recently  About how we had a great time  With you last time  You were on the show  Oh thank you  Thank you  I am fun to be with 
[02:55:00]  You're like  I just  I'm with me a lot  And I'm telling you  I'm enjoying myself  And then  I was wondering  Why isn't Howie live  In the studio with us  Then I was starting to think  Man maybe we scared him off  Because we were doing  All that OCD stuff to him  It's actually better  I don't really like  These phone deals  So I would be better  To be there  But I'm in LA  And I'm sure  Deal or no deal  And I can't  I didn't make  Even a New York trip  This  Right okay  I will be there 
[02:55:30]  I promise  Do you have a list of stations  You just gotta do  One after another  That's exactly  How this works  I've been there  For hours  And then  I'm not even dialing  I call this one number  And this lady hooks me in  I don't even  I think she's on the line  She listens  Right  Yeah they always listen  So that way they can go  This call's over  If we have inappropriate  I don't really know  I don't know  I don't know how this works  But I get up really early  I'm in my home  In Los Angeles  Right  And I call this lady  And she called you 
[02:56:00]  But I was happy to see  That you were on the list  In fact right before you  I was in Arkansas  Yeah you get to go  All over the country  From your  Bedroom  Without leaving my room  No it's very  Yeah it's very early  In Los Angeles  Are you in bed right now?  Be honest  No  No because my wife's in bed  And she's sleeping  So I'm in a little  Downstairs on a phone  Okay  I was wondering  Fireless  Cordless phone  I'm sitting  In a corner  Kind of in a fetal position  Because I've done  Conference calls 
[02:56:30]  In bed  Completely nude  You said like  That's going to turn me on  No  No  There's something  Really passive aggressive  About that though  That's wonderful  Well Anthony and I  We have to call each other  A lot for the radio show  And we have no problem  Telling each other  You know I'm taking  This phone call  From the bull  Yeah I'm sitting  On the bull  Or I'm nude  Taking a crap  As we discuss business  People will say  I'm taking a crap  Or I'm doing that  Or you caught me  In the toilet  People have no 
[02:57:00]  They're not  You know people  Aren't embarrassed  About that  And that's okay  We're all human  And we all do that  It amazes me on the phone  What people do get  Embarrassed about  Like you ever call  Somebody like  At four in the morning  Or three in the morning  You dial it  And they'll answer  Hello  And you go  Did I wake you up  And they go  No  No  No  No  Yeah why is that  No I was  They were sleeping  God forbid  You can know  I'm taking a crap  I'm sitting here  I'm talking to you  I'm taking a crap  I can't get off the pot  But God forbid  You should know  I'm sleeping  Yeah  No it's just 
[02:57:30]  Burying a body  I was not sleeping  Why would you  Think I was sleeping  I'm not sleeping  Don't accuse me  Of sleeping  So that's what  Now this  Deal or no deal  Started in October 2005  It's been two years already  It's been two years  It's amazing  Damn  That went fast huh  It's amazing  Third season  Tonight you gotta watch  Because tonight  They got this NFL show  NFL superstars  And people at home  Can win a million bucks  Just by playing  The lucky case game 
[02:58:00]  But that's not even  The reason to watch  And we're starting  A million dollar mission  And somebody can win  Not tonight  But it's coming up  One hundred million dollars  But tonight  Because of the NFL  Theme  The girls are wearing  Just NFL jerseys  Two words  Oh  Nice  Sexing up the show  A little bit  I gotta tell you  Howie  And I don't want them  To hang up on this  It is the dumbest show  But I love it  Because of Howie Mandel  The truth of the matter  Is when it was offered  To me  I didn't get it  I said there's no show  There's no game 
[02:58:30]  There's no trivia  There's no stunts  There's no  There's no game  There's just a bunch  Of brief  It's hard to imagine now  But when they describe  The game to me  You know  They told me  That it's an hour  You know  Somebody's gonna  Pick a case  They're gonna have  These 26 hotties  Holding case  Somebody picks a case  And then we'll  Open you know  Open six  And then we'll  Open five  And we'll see  What's inside  And then we'll  Keep making them offers  I didn't think  There was a show  I didn't see it  And that's why  Where are the questions  I flew to South America  So I wouldn't be embarrassed  When it aired  I didn't know 
[02:59:00]  That there is a show  And the show is  Just to watch  These characters  You know  Just to watch  How people react  Under this  Kind of pressure  And hopefully  Somebody walks out of there  With a million bucks  But you know  And sometimes  Even on a first episode  On Monday night  People crash and burn  She went home  With twenty five dollars  Nice  There's no reason  To go home with twenty five dollars  The real  No  You really do make the show  Howie  Just how you interact  And you just play it up  Perfectly  Did you guys like  Did you guys throw any other  Like new angles 
[02:59:30]  Into the show this year  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are  There are some surprises  And some ways of playing the show  This  Well obviously  The million dollars  For a home viewer  But I mean  We're actually going to have  Some contests  Going on  With  From player to player  In upcoming episodes  And there's going to be  Some additional  Little twists and turns  You know  We try to shake it up  More for ourselves  You know  We have to show up  And do every game we do  So we're just trying to figure out  More fun ways  To do it 
[03:00:00]  And the fact that there's going to be  A hundred million dollar game  Is absolutely huge  And also  The million dollar mission  Which is  Anytime somebody walks out  Without a million dollars  We're going to add another million dollar case  So you know  Right now  You've got pretty good odds  One out of twenty six  Chance of hitting the million dollar case  So if they don't  Get the million dollar case  Or stay in for the whole game  Then we'll have two cases  With a million  Three cases with a million  Four cases with a million  Oh progressive each week  Damn  Yes  Or each player  Not necessarily each week  It could be  Oh okay  You know  You guys really want to give it away 
[03:00:30]  Don't you  We're trying  We're trying  But you know  It's been tough so far  I think the highest amount so far  Has been $750,000  Which is  None of them to sneeze at  So that's  It's been  So there'll be a lot of twists  It is kind of rough to go on  When the money gets so high  And you're like  Ah well  I could get a million  Or I could get real crap  But that's what really presents  The  What's the dilemma  I was trying to  Well that's the dilemma  Yeah  Because no one  Ever waits to the end 
[03:01:00]  To see that they  Actually pick the million  Because the offers are so great  Yeah  Near the end  Well you know  The one woman  Who walked out with $750,000  There were two cases left  $750,000  And a million dollars  And she had an $880,000 offer  So she said no deal  To the $880,000  As I probably would have  Yeah  Yeah at that point  You gotta go for the million  Right  And she got the $750,000  Obviously huh  Yeah she got the $750  How many times  Have the contestants  Picked the million dollar case  You would be surprised 
[03:01:30]  And so would I  It's a lot  I've seen it a bunch of times  It's a 26 chance  There's been a lot  I don't have the stats  In front of me  But a lot of times  And that is heartbreaking  Too  Because you know  You get out  And you dump out  At $100,000  Or even $200,000  And you had the feeling  And then you sold  Your million dollar case  For $200,000  Which is  You watch people  And they get so disappointed  But you're walking out  With almost a quarter  Of a million dollars  Don't be disappointed  Yeah but they're thinking  It could have been  It could have been  It could have been  A million 
[03:02:00]  And they actually  Cut it out  Because it was just  It was just  Too much for them  But one of the  It was not funny  But it's interesting  One of the women  That had the million dollar case  She picked the case  And I said  Why did you pick the case?  And she said to me  Howie  Last night  The light came into my room  And the Lord himself  Sat on my bed  And told me to pick  14  And at first  I was flattered  That the Lord  Even watches my game  Plays it  And then the game goes on  And she goes 
[03:02:30]  You know the Lord  Told me to stick with my case  So I'm going to say  No deal  Because you've got to  Have the faith  You've got to have the faith  And you know  We're offering her  You know  $50,000  $75,000  I've got to have the faith  No deal  $150,000  I've got to have the faith  No deal  I've got to have the faith  No deal  And then we offer her  Something like  $300,000  Or $200,000  And she goes  Deal  I can't  I can't go on  You know  What happened was  She knocks out the  $750,000  She knocks out the $500,000  So there's only  One case left  With the big money 
[03:03:00]  And then it's like  $5,000  $6,000  She's got like  A $300,000 offer  And then all the loan monies  And she goes  Deal  I've got to take it  You know  I lost the faith  You know what I mean  I've got to take it  I guarantee $300,000  And we open her case  And her case  Had the million dollars  In it  No way  I swear  I swear  Her case  Had the million dollars  In it  And she just  Passed out cold  You know  They left the  Jesus  They cut it out  Of the show  But  Why did they cut  Jesus out 
[03:03:30]  Of the show  Yeah  Why  That's great  I mean  That's  That would have  Made great TV  Because  He was right  Yeah  The Lord was right  Boy she's got  Some spleening to do  He's been our  Smartest contestant  So far  Apparently  It's not like  Jesus told her  To pick a $75 case  He gave her  The right number  Yes  So there's been  There's been things  Where they had the faith  That she should have  Kept the faith  So she had a million dollar case  That's really interesting  It is  What's the dumbest question  People have asked you 
[03:04:00]  During this radio tour  The dumbest question  That people have asked me  During this particular radio tour  Yeah  I don't know  I can't think of  A dumb question  You know what  I don't know  I don't know  What a dumb question  He's asleep  Through half of these  I'm sure  You just gotta  This is really early  In the morning  In LA  Yeah  A lot of people say  What are you wearing  And it's more like  Just a  Just an obscene phone call 
[03:04:30]  Than a radio interview  What are you wearing  I'm gonna say  It's like some sort of  Like a  Space suit  I say a robe  With an ascot  Really  Yeah  No I'm just  Wrapped in tinfoil  Damn  It's me fresh  For the rest of the day  I'm naked  Wrapped in tinfoil  Hey Howie  How's the OCD  How's the OCD  Say that again  How's the OCD  Cause you're like  You have a lot of  Interaction with a lot  Of different people 
[03:05:00]  With deal and no need  No my interaction  OCD is  You obsessing  About things  That make no sense  I just can't shake hands  I could hug  You know  I did a show  The other day  And something dropped  On the floor  And I ended up  Putting it near my mouth  And I actually was okay  With that for some reason  But I can't shake hands  You know  I count things  I have different rituals  So it  And OCD has ebbs and flows  You know  Sometimes I'm better  Sometimes it's hard  To get past the moment  And function  But I have a terrific  Therapist 
[03:05:30]  Who I've moved into  Countless number of tax brackets  Who is really  The winning  Who's the winning person  I got a hit show  She has a hit client  Yeah there you go  My mom has it really bad  So it's a nightmare  I have a question  Not all the time right  It's ebbs and flows right  It certainly is  An ebb and flow thing  When you shake hands  Well you weren't like that  Yesterday you know  Right  People are always  Trying to reason with me  You know  Yeah there's no rhyme  Or reason to it 
[03:06:00]  There isn't a rhyme  Or reason  And that's why  You obsess  And you know  And you have these  Compulsions to do things  And you have the need  To do things  But maybe yesterday  In the exact same spot  I didn't have the need  So you know  People are always  Trying to challenge me on it  You know  But that's my thing  You know  Mental health  I actually got to go  To Washington  And talk to the Senate  About mental health issues  Which was pretty cool  I don't know  If nothing's going to change  But it was great to do  When you shake hands  Is there like a thought  That will go through your head 
[03:06:30]  Or is it just  I don't shake hands  What I'm saying  If you  In a long time  I don't  He does a little fist  And you'll do the fist  To be told  I probably could shake a hand  And nothing will happen  But the times that I've shaken  Yes a thought will go through my hand  That there's something on my hand now  And then I'll go wash my hand  And I'll scald my hand  And then I'll come out  And you'll think it'll be okay  I wash my hand  And I can't get that thought  Out of my mind  And I can't hear what you're saying  And I can't hear  I can't focus on what's happening  And I would rather just go home  And scald myself  For the next 
[03:07:00]  You know  Two hours  Or three hours  Do you remember  Do you remember the last person's hand  That you shook  Who was it  No  I don't  No  Whose hand would you shake  I made a decision  Just to kind of not even deal  With those thoughts  Just not even  Wait let's make a deal  Deal or no deal  Whose hand would you shake  That's a good one Jimmy  Like there's got to be  We all have that person  We would love to meet  What if that person  Is in front of Howie Mandel  And they  And they reach out their hand  Who would that person be  Who would I  Whose hand would I shake  Yeah 
[03:07:30]  Like who would you not be  It just has to do with the mindset  That I'm in at the moment  You know what I mean  And you know what  I'll go and shake anybody's hand  And then what will happen  That may or may not trigger  You know  Whatever issues I have  But people are offering me money  To shake hands  Really  Yeah  Like a deal or no deal thing  Some of the  What are they called  Antibacterial companies  They're trying to offer money  To use their antibacterial  And shake hands  I haven't done it yet  But you know  If the offer was good enough 
[03:08:00]  I'd go shake hands  And then spend two days  In the shower  We use that stuff  All the time  Yeah  Well I'm actually  At this point  I don't  I can't use it  Because  I killed  I don't know if we talked  About that last time  When I was doing my  I did a daytime talk show  About ten years ago  And they didn't want me  To talk about my OCD  They didn't want me  To even raise this  In front of the daytime public  You know  Because they said  That it would just  Freak people out  So my friend's a surgeon  And I got that  You know that stuff  That surgical scrub  That they have  I had that little brush 
[03:08:30]  And that you know  Before they go into surgery  And before shows  I would wash my hands  In the commercials  I would antibacterialize my hands  And I would scrub up  Like three four times a day  And then I started getting  Warts on my hands  Because that's a virus  A word is a virus  And I killed all the antibodies  In my hands  I have no  I had no antibodies  Oh so  So the good stuff  You died with the bad stuff  And weren't able to fight off  Yeah I'm always thinking of germs  But I just got a great thing  I just bought this toilet  I just bought this toilet 
[03:09:00]  Which has just been  The savior of my life  I don't represent them  But I got this toilet  From Toto  This Neorest  Have you seen the Neorest 600?  No  What is this?  It sounds fantastic  Yeah  It's fantastic  I actually started in New York  I was staying at the presidential suite  At the W Hotel  In Times Square  And I read  You know  I had been traveling all day  And I said  I'll meet my wife in the lobby  I just gotta run upstairs  And go use the bathroom  Just for a second  So I run upstairs 
[03:09:30]  And you know  I had just checked in  I didn't know what the room was  And it was dark  In the room  And I ran into what I thought  Was the bathroom  And it was the bathroom  And then miraculously  The seat goes up  I didn't touch it  I just ran past the toilet  The seat goes up miraculously  And there's a light  In the toilet  So you don't have to turn on a light  You don't touch a seat  And it's like  It's so inviting  So you  Wow  You sit down  And as you  As you use the bathroom  It automatically flushes  And deodorizes the bowl  And then 
[03:10:00]  It cleans you  There's no use of toilet paper  It cleans you  And you don't touch any  You don't touch anything  You just sit there  And everything  Gets taken care of  I'm looking at  I'm looking at  I'm looking at a picture  I have nothing from these people  How much was the toilet  How much was the toilet  How much is the toilet  I think it's about  Three or five thousand dollars  And there's a bidet in it too  But after you shit  Does it wash you  I'll tell you what I did  That was really bad 
[03:10:30]  You can  There is a thing  You can touch on the side  Where you can  The bidet is  So you check  You know  You want it pulsating water  Do you want the water to be warm  You choose the water  Right  You choose the  I want car wash mode  Shut up your ass  But then  I didn't understand the concept  I've never had anything like this  So it says back wash  Right  And then there's a button  That says front wash  I figure you know  You want it all clean  Right  I didn't know that  That's for the ladies  And you know  I don't  So I hit front wash 
[03:11:00]  Accidentally  I didn't know  And we don't have a front to watch  And I'm not a boxer  But I would imagine  You know the speed bag  Oh damn  I mean  And it was pulsating warm  It's like  Oh  And I started screaming  Like a woman  Yeah that'll hurt  Shit  And then  And then I didn't want to get up  Because I thought it would  Shoot all over the room  But it just  And I was trying  I was hitting all the buttons  But I felt like Captain Kirk  You know  I'm sitting there  And I got the controls  And it was my starship ass prize  It was just  It was just an amazing  That's kind of saved my life 
[03:11:30]  Yeah we're looking at  Yeah we're looking at pictures of it  It looks like a space helmet  Yeah  With the lids down  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  600  The Toto Neo Rest 600  It's just an amazing  I think Anthony's going to pick this up  Wow  That is a nice shitter  Well can you go to the store  And see them  I was going to buy another one  For the guest  For the guest room  The guest bathroom  In the house  Because I thought it was so cool  And it's a great thing  But she said she doesn't want  Our guests lingering  Yeah  Don't want them just  Come in there for the bathroom  Well you'd linger 
[03:12:00]  You're going to sit there  I mean the seat is warm  It deodorizes  It flushes  But real  It's tough to get off the shitter  When you got something like that  Yeah that is nice  Now I got to try that out  You see it  Do you have it right there  Absolutely yeah  That's the Cadillac of toilets  It's very space age  Yeah  Yeah  That is definitely something  That ought to be in like Star Wars  Yeah  But I mean you can go check it out  Go to the W Hotel  To the Presidential Suite  It's just amazing  I would go there  And check in  And just take a crap  Just take a dump and leave

[03:14:00]  At 8pm on NBC  Howie Mandel everyone  I want one of those  Toilets man  Yeah  Who wouldn't  I might get one  Toilets fantastic  Fuck is  I think that Americans  Have a higher rate  Of colon cancer and shit  Because we don't use bidets  Europeans apparently  Have healthier assholes  Get out of here  I've heard that  Yeah it's just a health  The Greek  Have healthier assholes  Well there's a cock  All clean on the fucking  Way out of there  There's no time for build up  No I heard a bidet  Is very healthy  Maybe somebody could call in  And tell me about that  Yeah  Yeah  But I mean  Asshole health is important 
[03:14:30]  Am I right or wrong  You're right  All right we're gonna  Take another break  I'm reading this  I'm reading stuff  About the  Jenna 6 case  Yeah  Oh yeah  I don't know if I agree  Or disagree  It was a whole thing  Oh I know  Stuff happened beforehand  But there were racial problems  At the school  Yeah between white and black students  I just don't know  I think black leaders are saying  That they just don't think  They should be charged  With attempted murder  When this was  I don't know 
[03:15:00]  I don't know how bad  The kid was beaten up  All I do  Is I spin it around  And think of how it would be treated  If it was the other way  And that's the way  I want this treated  I will say  That three nooses  Were found hanging  From the white tree  I guess they  They're really segregated down there  And they hung  Nooses  Yeah because the black kids  Were sitting under the tree  That the white kids  Usually sit under  So  Hold on  It was after a black student  Asked to sit under the tree  Yeah  One black student  He asked if he could sit under the tree  Yeah  And they hung nooses 
[03:15:30]  The principal recommended  Expelling the three white students  Was overruled by the superintendent  Just a lot of  A lot of racial tension  That they didn't seem  To really take care of  And then it culminated  In this beating  Of a white student  By these black guys  Black students  And you know  Whatever  Whatever they're charged with  Let them go to trial  It's stupid to charge someone  Who had attempted murder  If obviously they weren't  Trying to murder someone 
[03:16:00]  Because then they're going to  Get off  They're going to get off the hook  White guy beat up a black student  Who showed up at an all white party  White guy pulled a shotgun  On three black students  It was getting really ugly  And this  This kid got beaten  He fought  That's the problem  It's a six on one  I don't know how many punches  Each one threw  But he was knocked unconscious  And he suffered cuts and bruises  Which is not that  It's not like  His fucking jaw was broken  Or  His skull  He was caved in  He was in a coma  I saw pictures of him  His face was red  He got beat up 
[03:16:30]  But I mean  I've seen a lot worse beating  It didn't look like  He was almost murdered  By six people  I'll say that  If you look at the pictures of him  They pleaded down  To assault a deadly weapon  And they said  Their shoes  They kicked the kid with  With a deadly weapon  I don't know  I can't say  Six on one  Is a bad move  But  I just don't like  The double standard there  I agree  It's there  Believe me  If it was the other way around  They'd be marching also  They're gonna have a big march  Down there  Tomorrow I guess 
[03:17:00]  That's not black people's fault  That's fucking white people  White people  Would never march  In favor of other white people  Like white people  Would never march  In favor of Fat Nick  No  Because the white people  Are pussies  That has nothing to do  With black people  Not marching  That's white people  Just being fucking faggots  And being afraid  To be politically incorrect  The perfect justice system  Is not supposed to  Take into consideration  Marches  And things like that  They're just supposed to  Blind justice  Let's go to Kier  Louisiana hasn't probably  Displayed a lot of  Blind justice  Historically  I know  It's not a good example  Wait wait 
[03:17:30]  This guy wants in  What's your name sir?  Kier  From Louisiana  Alright  What's up?  The background on that  Was that  It was black kids  That wanted to go  Stand under a shade tree  In the schoolyard  That only white kids  Had been allowed to stand under  And they asked the principal  If they could go  Stand under that tree  And the principal said  Yeah  It's a free country  And when they went out  To do it that morning  There were six nooses  Hanging from the tree  And that's what  Kind of precipitated 
[03:18:00]  The incident  Where they ended up  Fighting with the white kids  Right  I was just reading  All the details  Back and forth  But the six guys  That beat up the one guy  Apparently  It says here  That he had  Wait hold on  It says  That there was somebody  He called  I'm trying to find it dude  I'm sorry  Hold on a second  He was calling the guys  Like called them niggers  Or something  Yeah he called them  It just got really ugly  He got beat up by black  Yeah  He seemed like the kind of guy  That deserved to get the shit beat out of him  But maybe not by  But I don't know what the 
[03:18:30]  How bad are they  I'm babbling  I'm sorry  How bad did they beat him?  Real bad  Pretty good  But you know  Didn't kill him  Did you say real bad sir  Or not  Yeah yeah  He said real bad  No real bad  Real bad  And it was just a long  Simmering racial tension thing there  I mean  Yeah it's been going on for a while  Yeah  But how bad  It didn't look like it was that bad  He got knocked out  But it didn't look that bad  He was just red  His face was red  From being punched  And probably kicked  But it was like  I don't know  It's on the outside  On the inside of that 
[03:19:00]  Is your brain  Well no broken cheekbones  A broken jaw  As far as I can see  No teeth knocked out  I don't even know  If his nose was broken  Right  Which is  Which is why  The other folks  Are thinking  That they should not  Have been charged  With attempted murder  And with such serious charges  That's what I'm saying  You can see his eye  Is swollen  Look at him  I mean he got  He got swollen up  He got beaten  But that doesn't look like  That could kill you  Right there  Because if that was  A kick to the face  To the temple  Like that  The side of the head  You could screw 
[03:19:30]  The guy's brain up  Well did he call  I don't know  Did he say that  To some black guys  If he did  Look if you say that  To six black dudes  What do you expect  Is going to happen  You're going to get  A fucking beat down  It's stupid  I don't know if he said that  Hold on  He was a vocal supporter  Of the students  Who hung the nooses  He taunted a black student  Allegedly called  Several black students  Digger and was beaten up  By black students  Six  Whatever  So he was just  A shit talking  Fucking hick  Who got a beating  And maybe didn't deserve  The beating he got  But fucking attempted murder  A lot of racial tension 
[03:20:00]  There should have been  Dealt with earlier  I agree  They just kind of  Let it simmer  In a school  Because of a cowardly  Principal  And what  Lack of parenting  How about if you get  The parents down there  To meet  And settle the shit  You know  But they just let it  Sit there  And sit there  Until someone goes in  And shoots a school up  Or something like this  Happens  Just blame it on video games  Bob in Jersey  Hey how you doing  I had read that  That guy who got 
[03:20:30]  Beat up  But he left the  Hospital that night  So he couldn't  Have been hurt  That bad  I don't think  He was hurt  That bad  And I'm not saying  Again that  He didn't get  Fucked up  But to me  What six guys  Could do to you  To be charged  Attempted murder  It didn't seem like  Happened to this guy  It just didn't seem  Like it was that  Savage of fucking beating  Alright why don't we  Take a break then  They might have all  Just fucking threw  Punches at him  And kicked him  But I've seen  Group stuff like that  Where like literally  A couple of punches  Are landing  And like  It's not like six guys 
[03:21:00]  Are systematically  Beating you to death  Like fucking  Like a Reginald Denny  Type of beat  That was a fucking  Beatdown  If you left the hospital  That night  I mean that's  Attempted murders  See what happens  20 years in prison  Is a long time  Just for a fucking  Ass beating  I like turtles  Me too  Opie  I like to make  Werewolf movies  Yes  Damn 
[03:21:30]  You've been  Pwned  Damn  Oos  Oos  Alright quick break  And we'll continue  It's Opie and Anthony  The Norton and Faggot show  That's what we should  Call it program  I know  How to handle cock  All my cocks got in  iPods  Corn on the cob  Smoothies  Egg white omelets  Bagels and seltzer  Starbucks apple cake  Absolutely 
[03:22:00]  And rollerblading  White cocks  Black cocks  Two fruits  Two fruits  I know  How to handle cock  Not only do I know  How to handle cocks  I love doing it  Opie and Anthony  Welcome 
[03:22:30]  Back to the Opie and Anthony show  I'm Jim Norton  Satellite radio  And that's Anthony  And Opie's coming around  And Steve's here  And so's there  In Iraq  I'm scrolling  I'm scrolling  And clicking  Scrolling  Clicking  He's gonna call  Bob's cell  And see if he can  Take care of that thing  What thing  I don't  Okay good  Good  Dang 
[03:23:00]  Yeah  It's all  Well let's get  Doug is a black guy  From Baton Rouge  Doug what's going on buddy  What's up man  How are you man  I'm pretty good  I'm pretty good man  Talking about the little case  And what not  Dude  If you understand  The background  Of the whole situation  You really kind of  Get a better view of it  Jenna is like  A racist  Racist  Epitome of racist town  You know what I'm saying  Like Louisiana  As a general  Is still stuck  In the freaking  Sewer rights area 
[03:23:30]  And this whole thing  Was not really  Aimed towards  Those guys  Getting any kind of  Slack on this  As opposed to  The white students  What do the houses  Cost down there  Say what  Just curious  Probably not very  Exposed  Yeah  I think he was asking  High property taxes  He's implying  That he wants  To move there  Because  Slow joke  I correct that  It's the most racist  Place in the city  Next to the  Cumbia household  But I mean  God bless Doug 
[03:24:00]  From Baton Rouge  Doug  That's funny man  The back and forth  Racial shit  That was happening  With these guys  I mean the black students  I think the white students  Started this  How bad was the beating  They gave this guy  It was not bad  They had news coverage  Like all over the state  The guy got beat  Pretty bad  Okay I'm not gonna say  It was a pat on the back  But at the same time  It wasn't attempted  Fucking murder  You know what I'm saying  Yeah  The guy got beat up 
[03:24:30]  By six guys  It could have been  A lot worse  You know  And this guy  They did like a little  Background on this guy  He is like the  Campus dick  You know  His parents were probably  Cousins and all that  Kind of shit  And he had it coming to them  But he was the only one  That kind of  Proded the situation  To the point where  It got really really bad  You know  When the guys went  And hung the nooses  In the tree  And were harassing  The black students  At the parties  And everything like that  The white faculty  In this racist ass town  Of course  Was gonna sweep it  Under the rug 
[03:25:00]  You know  And that's how it is  Down here in Louisiana  If you really  You have to be  At a point where  You can turn your back  On a lot of things  As far as  The blatant racism  That you met with  As a black person  In Louisiana  I go to LSU  And it's there  Every freaking day  You know what I'm saying  Like the fact  That it feels like  Say what  Did they break  It didn't  Like it looked to me  Like they  They fucked him up  Like he got kicked  And he got  The shit beat out of him  Did they  They didn't break his  Did they break his jaw 
[03:25:30]  Or his eye socket  Or anything like that  No  No  And the thing is  You can kind of see  You know  If someone is trying  To really beat  The piss out of you  They gonna do that  Let alone six guys  At once  I mean the most  They did  They blacked his eye  They punched him up  They hit him  Not like they  Kicked him or anything  One of the guys  Took his shoe off  And hit him on the body  With his shoe  As opposed to  Stomping the kid out  You know what I'm saying  You can tell  They were really  Trying to get their point across  They were pissed off  Up to the point  Where everything  Kind of went down 
[03:26:00]  But  They weren't trying  They weren't trying  To kill the kid  You know  The fact that he got  An ass whooping  By six guys  But still left  The hospital that night  I mean that's saying a lot  I had a friend  That had the same  Kind of thing  Happen to him  Like weeks ago  He got beat up  He got beat up  By two or three  White guys  On the campus  During a tailgate  But he left  The hospital that night  I mean he got  His ass whooped  But it still  Wasn't a life  Threatening injury  You know what I'm saying  So it's like  The way they're  Blowing it out of proportion  Is only because  Of the racial environment  Of the city  And it's like  There are a lot  Of cities in the south  Like Jenna  In Louisiana 
[03:26:30]  Viner  In Texas  You know  There's a whole  Bunch of different  Environments  Where that kind of  Stuff still  Exists  From what I'm hearing  From you  And from what I've seen  Of the photos  Of the guy  He sounds like  A real cocksucker  Who just got  The ass beating  He deserved  Fuck him  Exactly  He got what he had  Coming to him  But the course  That good old  White pride  You guys have  It's just  You know  Can't let  Something like that  Go without  Trying to  Make a statement  And it's so  Like I'm telling you  The racial temperature 
[03:27:00]  Down here  Is so freaking  Ridiculous man  Like it's so freaking  Well you have to realize  Living in New York  You deal with  You deal with  Certain cases  But you mostly deal  With a politically  Correct reaction  Up here  Where anything  That's white on black  Is blown out of proportion  Just because of  The politically incorrect  View of it  Or you know  Whatever  With how it looks  Publicly  Yeah they don't  Sweep it under  The carpet up here  They like hang it up  So everyone could see it  And amplify it  But that sounds  Really legitimate  New York  In the south  The south 
[03:27:30]  Louisiana  Mississippi  Alabama  All that kind of stuff  Up north  Yeah it's used  As political means  To I guess  To get  Get agendas done  Or whatever it is  But down here  Is really  Like the mentality  Is still that of  You know  There's that separate  That kind of separation  That heavy separation  That obvious separation  You know  If you're on the wrong  Side of town  There's still cops  That will  Like come at you  Like in the middle  Of a crowd  For the white people  And pick you  Out of the crowd  That's how it is 
[03:28:00]  Down here  The south  The south  Is still  At that  Dickhead  Kind of phase  Where  We're waiting  To get  You know  We're waiting  To get there  You know  What I'm saying  Right  All right  Doug  Excuse me  We got Rick  On the line  From Louisiana  Rick you're on  With Doug  Hey good morning  Yeah I live  30 miles  From Gina  Louisiana  And Gina  Is no more  Racist than  New Orleans  Is  Gina is  70%  Black  And last  Year  There was  A shooting  In a black 
[03:28:30]  Church  In Gina  By another  Black person  That killed  A black person  And nothing  Was said  About this  Well  Actually  It's a crime  That fits  The punishment  I mean  The guy  Murdered  Or probably  Was the guy  Killed  That he shot  It was a black  Dude  That killed  Another black  And nothing  Was ever said  About it  Well I mean  That's pretty much  Due process  You go in there  In a church  And shoot a guy  And you get  Charged for murder  You know  But you're saying  The people  In general  Right  A bunch of  High school kids  That beat up 
[03:29:00]  A guy  High school  Kids get beat up  In high school  All the time  You know what I'm saying  Kids get beat up  In high school  All the time  But never has it  Been to the point  Where  I promise you  Anywhere outside  Of this whole  Confederate south  Would there be  Such a charge  As attempted  Murder  For a guy  Getting beat up  He got beat up  You know  He antagonized  A situation  That really should  Have been handled  By the adults  In the  Political officials  And school board  Officials  Before it got  To that point  It didn't  He got his ass 
[03:29:30]  Whooped  He had what he had  He got what he had  Coming to him  Simple as that  But attempted murder  For a 16 or 17 year old dude  You have to say  You cannot honestly say  That that is a just  Punishment  A just charge  If six people  Jump on me  And beat me down  To where I have  To go to  Emergency room  That's attempted  Murder I think  No it's not  Attempted murder  If six people  Jump on you  And beat you down  To where you had to go  To emergency room  Wouldn't you think  That somebody  Was killing you  Wait say it again  If six people 
[03:30:00]  Jumped on you  And beat you down  To where you had  To go to  Emergency room  Would you not  Think people  Were trying to kill you  No I would not  I would not think  People trying to kill me  Because first off  If six people  Jumped on me  And tried to kill me  They probably would  If they tried to kill me  That's the point  That I'm trying to  Put across  If six guys  Six guys to one  Tried  Wanted to kill this guy  Do you not think  They would have done that  Do you not think  They would have been  Able to do that  If they did not  Show any kind  Of signs of restraint 
[03:30:30]  Do you think  This guy would be  Living now  That's not  The point  The point is  That thing was going down  It was  The point is  If you don't want  One of him  Have you ever seen  Listen to JFK  The movie  Have you ever seen  This accident  With a mission  To end his life  They win him  To stop  They got fed up  If six guys  They got fed up  Of the treatment  They were getting  For a simple act  Of sitting under  A freaking tree 
[03:31:00]  Okay  They win at him  To get that point across  Because this dick  Wants to keep on  Pushing and pushing  And pushing the situation  He got his ass whooped  He did not have  Any life-threatening  Hair injuries  He did not  Break any bones  He did not lose  Any amount of blood  His eye was swollen  And he got bruises  If they had killed him  He deserved it  If they had killed him  He would have deserved it  What?  No  If they had killed him  A while ago  He deserved it  No one deserves to die  No one deserves to die  Over a stupid 
[03:31:30]  The one making sense  If you said  A while ago  He deserved to beat him  He said  What he deserved to beat him  So if he died  He would have deserved it  Can I ask the white guy  A question  Everyone's yelling over  To the white guy  Sir thank you  Sir at least ask you  I gotta disagree with you  On this man  Because the guy's telling you  Like an attempted murder  Means you're trying  To kill someone  And the guy  He's saying that  They deserved to  Get his ass beat  But he's not saying  That the guy  Deserves to die  It's like you're  Kind of putting words  In his mouth  By saying that 
[03:32:00]  If he had died  Yes  A murder charge  Would be justified  If he had died  If he came near death  Yes  A attempted murder charge  Would be justified  The guy got beat up  Six guys  Beat him to the point  Where he was not  Paralyzed  He did not  Lose  He did not lose  Any blood  He did not break  Any bones  He did not suffer  Any life threatening  Injuries  It's not just  An attempted murder charge  For those guys  For any one of them  It's not justified 
[03:32:30]  Now what about  A federal  What about  A federal hate crime  What about that  Where does  A beating  In an attempted murder  In the end though  One of the  One of the kids  One of the kids  Was 14  So you have  Five guys  And a 14 year old  Six people  And I think  A high school beat down  Is a little different  Than if six men  In a bar  Are beating you down  And hurting you  I think six grown men  In a social situation  Where you're not  In a school  Are beating you down 
[03:33:00]  I think  I think then  You might be looking  At an attempted murder  Because your beating  Is going to be  A lot more savage  That's what I'm saying  You got six kids  Dude  Six high school  Fucking kids  Not six guys  At a bar  Not six guys  At a clan rally  Or a panther rally  Whatever the hell  Is going to go down  In the city  Six high school kids  That got in a fight  Dude  If you start charging  Attempted murder  For every high school fight  Where the hell  Is the country headed  It's the jumping aspect  Of it  I think that  It instills that weird 
[03:33:30]  Thing in people  Because like  Six guys beating you up  But again  Just seeing this guy's injuries  When I first heard it  I'm like  Fuck these guys  Fuck them  But then I saw his injuries  And like  Knowing he didn't have  His ribs broken  Or his lung wasn't punctured  They could have given him  A tremendous beat down  If they really wanted to  Let's go to Clint  In Alabama  Clint  You're on with Doug  From Baton Rouge  Yeah I just  I really got to apologize  For the white guy  On there right now  From the heart of Alabama  The white guy's wrong  I mean the guy  Deserved to get his butt kicked  He shouldn't have 
[03:34:00]  Pushed the envelope  And if they wanted to kill him  They would have killed him  I mean that's just how it is  And Jimmy  Exactly  Thank you  Alright very good  My advice to you  Would be to  Get out of there  Move up north dude  Don't worry  I'm in law school  As soon as it's done  That I'm off to write  The fucking injustices  Of the world  And shit  You gotta get the fuck  Out of there  You know Doug  You're perfect for Atlanta  Call the U-Haul companies  And get your ass to Atlanta  ASAP  What type of law 
[03:34:30]  Civil or criminal  As we're doing  I'm trying to go into civil  I kind of  Got a taste of criminal law  And didn't really like it  But civil law  Is probably going to be my forte  Noise statutes  And such  All that shit  Get in a corporate  Love the show dude  Jimmy you rock  Thanks  Alright  You know I haven't said much  On this issue  I just want to say one thing  I think we should all  Agree to disagree  Well that'll settle it  Yeah 
[03:35:00]  The ultimate  We'll agree to disagree  We'll just agree  To disagree  You can see the guy  The white guy  Just reaching for like a  Well if he deserved it  No  Yeah  It was just a  I'd say we lost that one  Yeah  We lost that one  That was a fucking  That little debate  Let's say hi to  We didn't  I was  Well hold on  Excuse me  Let me  Before  We didn't  I was on Doug's side  Oh no no  I'm not saying you  I'm saying between the two callers  That were on 
[03:35:30]  The white guy and the black guy  Yeah white guy  We as whitey  We lost that one  No but  That's okay  I like Doug  I agreed with Doug  I don't identify with that white guy  Other than with my  I wasn't saying  You can jump on  You can jump on his side  And agree with him  And everything  But the truth of the matter is  You still lost that  No  Because you're a white guy  But I didn't lose it  And the white guy  Sounded like a complete idiot  And the black guy  Had all his facts straight  And he was  Right so I relate to the black guy  Intelligent and articulate 
[03:36:00]  And but  But we're white  So we lost that  No no  I relate to the black guy  Going to law school  Because I'm a bright fella  Who wanted to be a lawyer  At one point  We had a bad guy in the ring there  With that guy  I don't  He got his ass beat right there  He wasn't representing me  We lost  No  He had to  He's representing you  No  Whitey  He's not  Whitey  He's not  You're just a cracker  We're not  Cracker got his ass kicked right there  I'm an educated white gentleman  I like Doug  Well of course we like Doug 
[03:36:30]  He was right  Uh Stryker  Whackbag  What's up  Yeah hey buddy  Hey uh  I just got forced to listen  To 30 minutes of Stern  This morning  And the clicking of his teeth  Was so bad  I thought I was looking to  Attack of the Zulus  Yeah we gotta  Get to the bottom of that  Make sure he's okay  Yeah what's going on  I mean yeah  It was bad  A lot of people counting on him  When this merger goes through  We need his teeth to work  Yeah  His chopper's gotta work  Alright thank you Stryker  Uh 
[03:37:00]  Are we done  We're ready for line of the day here  I think so  Yeah  We've covered a lot of ground today  Yeah  Uh really fast  It's Hunter in Canada  Hunter  Hey I love you guys  Hey  Thank you  Hunter in Canada  Hi Jim  Hi  Speak  I think we're all dying to hear  Your fucking Van Halen song  It's amazing  Well it's not the finished product  No  It's not ready yet  You're talking about Pete  From Morningside  He took some of the clips  That Jimmy's been working on  Yeah 
[03:37:30]  For the brand new Van Halen song  I mean it's fun  But it's not Jimmy's vision  It's not my vision  Yeah  As an artist  And as a creator  I hear other listeners  Are working on their version  Of your song  Exactly  So  But so far we got Pete  From Morningside  He came up with this  With the few lines  You are willing to offer  The public  As far as the new  Van Halen song goes  So these are work parts  That Pete took  And put some guitar to  But he starts off  With the chorus almost  I know  That's all you really gave  Was the chorus  I'm defending Pete's version 
[03:38:00]  You really went right  For the chorus  Whoa hey you  Hey guess  Whoa hey you  Well guess who's back  Oh I like it  Hey that's alright  Yeah that's  That could be good  Whoa hey you  Well guess who's back  Alright  Oh that's a good one  Yeah  They'll be working that  Into their songs  Wait  You thought we were 
[03:38:30]  Gone forever  But now we're back  I think you should say  Back twice  In two fucking  Of course  Here's what Pete  Oh it stinks  Here's what Pete  Has come up with so far  We're back  We've been away 
[03:39:00]  For a long  Long  Long  Long time  We've been through changes  We've played some games  The more things change  The more things stay  The same  We're a little bit older  But we might find us  We're back  We're better than ever  We're back  We're back  Together forever  We're back  We're back 
[03:39:30]  We're better than ever  We're back  We're back  Together forever  We're back  Right  We're endless  I love that it's endless  We're back  We're back  We're back  We're back  We're back  We're back  There you go  So far 
[03:40:00]  Wow  I have this  What Pete has  What?  I will not have the first line rhyme  By the way  I mean it will rhyme  I won't  Whoa  Hey you  Well guess who's back  That'll be the first line  Oh yeah  That's rocking dude  One thing before line of the day  Let's not forget  This Friday  Two days away  It's Miss Pal Talk  The Miss Pal Talk contest  Yes  There's a girl in there today  Was that a tape?  Was that live?  It's a tape  Duh  She was fiddling  And doing all sorts of things  That's what I got when I asked 
[03:40:30]  Oh really?  Because I just punched it up  And I went  Is that girl Annette a tape?  And everybody just lambasted me  Duh Andy  Duh  Duh  It's a tape  Yeah  Yeah I guess so  Where is she from?  She's a real person  It's good tape  It's a good tape  But the thing is  It's true  It's better if it's live  Than if it's a tape  It'd be a great tape  If she just started shitting  On her own carpet  I don't know why  It was not a good tape  The winner's gonna receive 
[03:41:00]  $500  So I guess what's gonna happen  All day on Friday's show  We're gonna be taking a look  At Pal Talk  We got some judges  And they're gonna pick  The hottest girl  Doing the hottest stuff  I guess  Anything goes  Huh?  Couldn't raise the money  No  Of course not  Why?  Is it a contest rules thing?  Yeah which was so ridiculous  When I got the explanation  I know  Just change the stupid rule  Contestants are free  To do whatever they want  On camp to win  So this Friday  It's the Miss Pal Talk contest  One of many  Coming to the Opie and Anthony show 
[03:41:30]  But the first one's gonna be worth $500  Okay?  Right  Alright  I wouldn't mind  That with a log poking out  I wouldn't kiss the log  I'd just smooch it  And peek to the left  Over the cheek  And you see the log  Doing the old dipsy doodle  The old dipsy doodle  Yeah  It looks like  It looks like a soldier  Poking his head  Out of a tank top  Out of the top of a tank  Hello  The old peekaboo  Yeah the old  The old  I like the old dipsy doodle 
[03:42:00]  The old dipsy doodle  No the peekaboo  He's right  Technically  When it just pokes out  That's the peekaboo  But the old dipsy doodle  Is when she's standing up  And the log starts to slide out  And she sucks it  And it kind of  It curls a little  And then goes back in  That's the old dipsy doodle  Dipsy doodle  The old turtle head  Taking a look around  The old peekaboo  Is when she's lying on her stomach  And the shit log  Just comes out a little bit  For a look around  Like a periscope  But the old dipsy doodle  Is when she has to use her muscles  To suck it back up 
[03:42:30]  So it doesn't end up  On the linoleum  Or in her shoe  Dipsy doodle  The old  While you kiss the cheek  You just peek to the left  Out of your eye  To make sure the log  Doesn't drop on your socks  Watch the dipsy doodle  Change direction  It's going out  And then  Oh it goes back in  Yeah  Alright  We got lines of the day  Or a couple runner ups  And whatever  It's sponsored  So line of the day  Is brought to you by  Bodogfantasy.net  The one site on the web  That offers scouting  What wrong one  Yeah  Oops
