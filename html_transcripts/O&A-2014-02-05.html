<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing their treacherous commutes during a massive New York City snowstorm. Opie boasted about his "presidential" fix for a broken windshield wiper (a paperclip), which segued into jokes with racist undertones.  They detailed the challenges of navigating the snowy roads, the scarcity of cabs, and Anthony's hoarding of electronics in his snow-covered Escalade, contrasting it with Opie's discarding habits.  Producer Jimmy's icy cab ride was also recounted.  The conversation then shifted to nostalgic anecdotes about their own unreliable cars from their youth, including abandoning vehicles on the Cross Bronx Expressway, and comparing their high school cars with those of wealthier classmates, even mentioning Mariah Carey as a fellow high school student.  A surprising detail was the inclusion of their mothers' unusual activities, including one dumpster diving.

The show then took a dark turn, discussing the death of porn star Gloria Leonard and detailing some of her films. This led to a discussion of Philip Seymour Hoffman's death and the arrest of four individuals involved with his heroin addiction, focusing on the quantity of heroin found and its black market implications.  A brief mention of the movie *Tango & Cash* was made.

The conversation lightened with a discussion of Jerry Seinfeld's web series, "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee," and a Buzzfeed article criticizing its lack of diversity. Opie and Anthony defended Seinfeld, playing a clip where he addressed the criticism, emphasizing his focus on humor.  They expressed frustration with the article and the prevailing political correctness, expanding on the lack of diversity in comedy and perceived double standards between male and female comedians.

The show then turned to the TLC show "90 Day Fianc√©," focusing on a couple where a Midwestern man orders a bride from the Philippines.  A clip was played, and the hosts analyzed the couple's dynamics, including the man's difficult ex-wife, highlighting the cultural clashes and challenges.  This discussion continued into the next segment, further analyzing several couples from the show, using crude and sexually suggestive language to describe the women and their relationships. They speculated on producer manipulation for dramatic effect, detailing specific examples of cultural shock, communication barriers, and differing expectations. A caller (possibly) participated.  Later, Bill Burr called in, and the conversation shifted to the Bill Nye/Ken Ham debate, and their often irreverent views on religion.

A later segment, featuring Bill Burr in studio, focused on sports broadcasting, particularly ESPN and the Super Bowl halftime show. Burr expressed his dislike for the show's interruptions and his cynicism towards sports broadcasting.  The hosts discussed the NHL's outdoor games, comparing it to the NFL's promotional strategies under Roger Goodell.  They compared the popularity of soccer and hockey in America, with Burr sharing a humorous anecdote. Burr then described his Pro Bowl experience in Hawaii, detailing a funny incident involving a fan running onto the field.  His fear of the ocean led to a discussion of sharks and surfing, including a caller's shark attack story, and the use of striped surfboards.

The final segment featured a lengthy discussion on the band Badfinger, triggered by a listener's comment.  The hosts and callers detailed the band's history, focusing on the suicides of two members (Pete Ham and Tom Evans) and their manager's (Stan Polley) alleged role in their financial ruin.  The discussion involved accusations of stolen money and legal battles.  A Badfinger song and a more recent performance were played, highlighting the contrast in sound. The show concluded with promotional material, mentions of upcoming podcasts (Louis C.K. and Penn Jillette), a Jeopardy contestant's strategy, and some nonsensical interaction with an unseen individual in the studio.

[00:16:00]  very vague leave the house with the car and but he got lazy because i'm back with a screwdriver  well the cross bronx expressway it was a great one to dump a car back in the day yeah because you  would you would dump a car on the side of the road at the uh on the cross bronx expressway we all that  are a bit older remember you take that cross bronx expressway across the uh the gwb and you would see  those abandoned cars but nothing would be left now they would be on an anthill yeah they would be picked 
[00:16:30]  apart yeah so i believe my dad might have uh you know brought them in that area or somewhere close  helping out some of the urban youth i mean how did how much did it cost to get rid of an old car  i don't know i used to take them to the junkyard they would just take them the good like they were  the junkyards around long island a couple bucks right yeah yeah sometimes they give you a couple  hundred bucks for it a hundred bucks 50 bucks whatever no i don't know for sure uh-huh and my dad's  been gone about 10 years so i guess i'm safe but i'm thinking he might have done it because he might have got a 
[00:17:00]  a little taste of some insurance money or something oh okay well that's a whole different  thing i'm not sure though right i don't think anyone could prove that at this point but and  you tell the insurance company when you woke up it was gone right you parked it out back last night  because why wouldn't he just go to the junkyard and get maybe two hundred dollars cash or something  yeah yeah it would it would be this sketchy thing that the car was gone but then he got lazy when  he got older and uh instead of going the cross i'm just saying the cross bronx expressway but i'm 
[00:17:30]  sure he found he found a spot similar which was a good hour hour and a half from our house yeah but  then he got lazy when he got older and when the cars would die the main street huntington he brought  it right up the right up the street oh he didn't even make it to main street hunting oh no you know  where i used to live yeah yeah right at the top of the right at the top of the hill at the first  fucking set of stores and you guys would see it my i personally that that's another story from my  younger brothers but they said yeah they said they were driving by once and they're like dad that's  our why is our car and he would deny that it was ours and it would just be sitting in this parking lot 
[00:18:00]  which during the day you didn't notice but when everyone cleared out when business was over we would  be it would be the only car in the parking lot my brother's be like why is why is your car there and  my dad would make believe it wasn't ours and stuff and and then my brother would go but there's a  geneseo sticker on the back window you know where i was a college shenanigans that went on oh my god  a lot of shenanigans a lot of wheeling and dealing to make ends meet there you go hey you got to do

[00:29:00]  no this is the same they'll make the same logo whenever the ace of spades or whatever the  remember when tango and cash was out on the streets yeah tango what's that cash ah yeah they got some  stuff done right you think tango yeah well there was a heroin that was called tango and cash yeah and had the  little tango and cash on the the envelope on the lookout for tango and cash it's very bad stuff  it's a very bad movie too yes i would actually think the heroin was funnier than the dialogue 
[00:29:30]  between those two idiots like the playful banter i loathe playful banter loathe it i don't know tango  i don't know cash guys hang what are you doing just hanging around tango i see that cash  they have to say each other's names all the time in that was terrible  turk and rooster tango and cash all right  bag and douche  that's great i guess this drug place was our mot street down there

[00:33:00]  from a few weeks ago and uh bob kelly puke and doing very well and then you got this week's uh  podcast that just just uh just uh hit online pen jillette and louis ck so that's a good one all  right oh yeah uh speaking of uh funny people yeah jerry seinfeld you got the jerry seinfeld clip from  yesterday we should have got to that but he's a funny guy pat cooper uh took up a lot of time  time with his hate oh yeah with his hate his unbridled disdain of everyone dignity and honor 
[00:33:30]  you need dignity yeah oh boy uh you know everyone gets a pass at 85 if he lives long enough he'll  he'll hate us we're not stupid oh yeah yeah we know how this works he'll hate us he's burnt every  bridge he's ever made we know how this works yeah when someone comes uh from the other side 
[00:34:00]  to spew some hate you just know it's a matter of time before it happens to you yep that's just how  things work in the world yeah so jerry seinfeld is he has a wonderful uh web series called comedians  in cars getting coffee i'm all in i love uh i love very good i've seen every single um episode and he  sat down for a little interview and these fucking losers out there that are all just trying to find  something an angle for themselves huh right so um well why don't we just play it why don't we just 
[00:34:30]  get right into it so oh is this from cbs uh buzzfeed had something to do with it yeah i think it's one  of those joint from gawker no gawker wrote an article oh wait till you read it out wait to see the  gawker oh okay yeah yeah gawker took this clip and then took an opinion and did their of course they  did right always stinks so uh they're sitting down to talk to jerry seinfeld i have noticed that most  of the guests are mostly white males of 22 episodes yeah let's get into that pause bravo to jerry seinfeld 
[00:35:00]  yeah that's how right away that's how you deal with these assholes who actually said that to him  who's that guy he's from buzzfeed yeah and he doesn't as the clip goes on he takes no ownership  of the question why would he but that's even more like if you're gonna ask the question uh-huh ask it  right like don't ask the question there's a question floating around out there i'll just 
[00:35:30]  grab it for a second and throw it at you it's just this just cowardly like ambiguity yeah why what's  what's the issue they're mostly white males right let's see your fucking staff right let's see your  fucking staff how many people on your board of directors are black compared to white let's see  how many editorial uh folks over at gawker are black or not white and in the end it's not it's no  one's business who cares if jerry seinfeld wants to do a web series and he decides he wants to just put 
[00:36:00]  all white people on it which he he he didn't by the way yeah then that's that's his priority  if you put chris rock on there huh yeah and also mario joiner and it's not about putting why he's  just putting people he knows who are funny right oh he doesn't think blacks are funny uh why is there  an agenda maybe chappelle said no yeah yeah think of that maybe he asked dave and he said no right  he has chris rock on there and he has um i forgot the guy's fucking name he was in the um uh colin quinn  episode jimmy would know him too mario joiner oh you said yeah i apologize i apologize i was 
[00:36:30]  thinking of something else uh what you were saying and and and uh george george wallace i hate to  break into these dummies but george wallace and mario joiner are two of seinfeld's closest friends  yeah it's just so irritating to hear that question and this all started with the snl thing it turns out  that black broad they uh they hired or whatever is really funny okay but they were forced to do that  right in the end they were forced to do that yeah so now that happened so now everyone's like okay 
[00:37:00]  where can we go next who else is not using minorities or asians or black people so  so ridiculous it worked out in snl's favor in the end but we were forced to do that everyone knows it  can you imagine this saying that to a black guest uh-huh yeah right it wouldn't happen right  uh continue jerry but jerry you know gets right into this right away that but but you take a look  over here peter what do you see a lot of a lot of whiteys what's going on here but but i know this 
[00:37:30]  really pisses me off but go ahead oh this is me off well that's okay i'm go ahead but you made a  comment on the tina fey episode that i thought was interesting that i'd like to get your thoughts  on a little bit more you said you were talking to her and you said something about the female  comedians it's a struggle for them to balance their feminine projections with their comedic goals  yeah and in the context of comedy not gender diversity i just want to know what you meant by that 
[00:38:00]  well i was kind of curious what it's like to be a woman in comedy as opposed to a man there's a little  bit of a difference and i thought that might be an interesting thing to discuss from her perspective  she's so successful at it and i'm just wondering how she looked at it if she even thought about it  and she kind of gave me the answer which is yeah you do have to think about that but you know it's  just another thing to think about okay all right fair enough now you there were a lot of things about 
[00:38:30]  comedians in cars in the beginning the first ten i did i think were all white males and people were  writing all about that which part of the reason why i asked like people had tweeted at me when i said  i'm interviewing with jerry seinfeld and i asked him about their gender diversity  i mean the first people think it's it's the census or something i mean this has got to  represent the the actual pie chart of of america who cares it's just funny you know funny is is the  is the world that i live in you're funny i'm interested you're not funny i'm not interested 
[00:39:00]  and and i have no interest in gender or race or anything like that but everyone else is kind of  with their little calculating is this the exact right mix you know uh i i think that's uh to me  it's anti-comedy it's anti-comedy it's it's more about you know pc nonsense than are you making us  laugh or not right right good for you jerry seinfeld good for you and by the way most of his audience for 
[00:39:30]  his show was just it was white people watching it that was his his show and he's not i don't think he's  doing any type of a racial thought when he's fucking booking people of course acting like o'brien  right yeah so god that question annoys me and then gawker went with it i did not read the gawker  article yet it's brutal yeah it's irritating kyle yeah and it's kind of typical gawker too  typical snarky douchey white guy god of course like he basically says that in that clip 
[00:40:00]  right the implication is that non-white males are not funny right so but the guy is if he's  saying that it that's a it's a lie or it's a purposeful misdirection there's no way you can  hear that and be an intelligent person and think that seinfeld is discounting black talent by saying  i'm interested if you're funny i'm not interested if you're not funny that guy's using seinfeld saying  that as meaning i haven't had blacks on because they're not funny right and i find that to either be  purposely misdirected or stupid yeah what he's really saying is i don't think of it i just book 
[00:40:30]  right doesn't even think about it right he might have asked jamie fox and jamie said no or dave might  have said no yeah you don't know and if there's eight thousand white guys in a row that he has uh  does on his show it doesn't matter doesn't fucking matter to him he's just like this is who's on my  show he never even thinks about that shit and he takes the quote you know i live in funny is the world  i live in blah blah you're funny you're not funny and then this guy his name is kyle chayka 
[00:41:00]  or something yeah something like that kyle chayka um he writes the quote seems to suggest  that any comedian who is not a white male is also not funny right though he's also likely fed up with  the amount of bad comedy he's been forced to sit through in his waning career yeah like that this  this guy's such a waning career what is he talking about he just had everyone's talking about commercial  for his web series and and jerry seinfeld could do whatever the fuck he wants he has decided not 
[00:41:30]  to do much of course and and he finally came back with this comedians and cars getting coffee and it's  a huge success instead of coming out and doing a lame tv show he had the biggest show right so he  wants to just let that go he did that that b movie like he does weird little shit that he really wants  to do and that's what every comic's dream is right this guy who by the way doesn't have like  it doesn't even register on the scale of success that when compared to jerry is is making judgment 
[00:42:00]  and and and twisting words around and stuff that's the world we live in it is it absolutely go look at  your twitter right now that's the world we uh live in but people that had no desire or weren't brave  enough to try to do anything aren't good enough weren't brave enough trying to knock you down  right they're the ones that's the world we live in and and they're in high positions too i'm a blogger  shut it gawker is a pretty big website at least everyone knows they're fucking assholes this guy to 
[00:42:30]  you know miss uh read it like that is it's unbelievable it seems to imply just cut the  fucking white boy snarky douchey language and he continues it's more ego which is too bad because  seinfeld is downplaying the work of everyone from richard pryor and bill cosby to aziz and sorry mindy  kaling and eddie quang who are all in various stages of their own sitcoms that just might turn out to be 
[00:43:00]  the next seinfeld could you get this guy on the phone we can try i don't know try to get him on the  phone i don't know mindy or eddie and i do know aziz i would say with uh all due respect it's not  fair to put any of them in the category with prior right i mean it's like you really think  in that moment that jerry seinfeld is discounting richard pryor right if you believe that you're a  dumb motherfucker yeah let's try to get him on the phone to explain himself it was pretty obvious  what jerry seinfeld was saying you don't think he had any murphy on the show if he could of course 
[00:43:30]  he would if he would do it he'd do it a second i would imagine a bunch of guys said no to the  you know to the show and and if the guy really watched uh the web series it's very obvious that  jerry's using a lot of his friends yeah he came up with david letterman and jay leno they're both on  the show he's very close with colin quinn colin's on the show and then these other guys that you didn't  even know uh he was very close with uh are on the show they're all ones why don't you have more 
[00:44:00]  black friends most of them are on are his friends chris rock is a very good uh friend of jerry seinfeld  yeah exterminator and then there's a couple he just threw in because they're really hot right now so  yeah like god jervais and louis but he's known all those guys for 20 years i mean except for ricky  but i don't think like he's friends with tina fey necessarily they know each other and they've  probably right you know walk in the same circles but but there's a lot of guys that are really  truly his friends he invited a black marathon runner into his house that's how you're getting lazy now 
[00:44:30]  you're just getting lazy now exactly exactly maybe it was a problem is when he had michael richards  on and he made his laugh factory set out the window at a crosswalk  he did have michael richards on yeah of course it was his case he did have larry david on they  they go way back they're friends so it's obvious that he's going with just mostly his his closest 
[00:45:00]  friends and then if this thing continues i think this is the third season ready you know i'm sure he'll  be expanding and maybe he'll find some black people maybe even an asian who knows hey who knows can we  have i love a list of gawker's contributors who i would love to see what percentage of them are black  right or not snarky white people oh is that the guy he's the worst i don't look at just look at him  these people are just oh misinformed yeah just a wry look you know just a just a a douchey 
[00:45:30]  guilty smug idiot oh my god that's him huh yeah waning career that really irritates me this is  the guy we're talking about this guy's just writing a he looks like he's paper on 15 years old should  have loose leaf paper right that should have been in the garbage where does this come from why do  people have such a boy's shit come from they're little entitled baby boys and they want uh they they 
[00:46:00]  want to get to make a splash we're kind of giving them what they want because that is a non-issue and  that should just be ignored right we just talk about it because it's well unfortunately it's on gawker  which a lot of people go to it's not some out of the way blog and uh for the guy to just  twist what jerry said it's unbelievable well it appears seems to you're the really investigative  journalist you're digging deep if you if you love comedy i've never thought about what the 
[00:46:30]  color of the person was no i just didn't give a shit funny like funny is funny period that really  does uh transcend any type of racism i'll tell you the truth if you if you think someone's funny  it doesn't matter you're not watching going well he's a funny black guy he's funny for a black guy  right it's like no you're just like no that's funny period unless you're abroad you know well  broads aren't funny yeah they can't be no funny we all know that we certainly do know let's all be 
[00:47:00]  real here we had to fake it for that documentary no girls could be funny yeah that whole thing is  turned around there was a time women were just brutal to watch on a stage but i truly believe that  is completely turned around there's a lot of funny uh female comics out there that was the way  a lot the waste of time you get mad at during the rodney dangerfield young comedian specials  when it's like hey now here's a uh here's a very funny young lady right it's like all right time to 
[00:47:30]  take a piss well i mean back in the day roseanne she was very funny it was very rare that you would  get the generous it might not be your cup of tea yeah but she's very funny you weren't rolling at  rita rudner i never found her funny god no like i'm trying to remember some of the older uh  female comics that i liked how about that other dykey girl that got in a little jam up with uh  some uh young girls oh jesus paula poundstone she was she was some of her stuff was fine yeah yeah 
[00:48:00]  she was a bit edgy with her comedy what about the chubby filipino uh woman cho yeah margaret cho  isn't she korean oh is she i don't know she's one of those maybe she's korean she's one of those  she's she's carved out quite the uh gay niche for herself i think the gays really like her i'll be  honest i don't know much of her stuff in the end i don't really know much of her stuff so i don't  have an opinion on her sarah silverman but that's more new i was i'm trying to think like yeah yeah 
[00:48:30]  early 90s and the 80s don't you automatically i said rosie oh yeah don't you automatically think  though like when a woman comic comes up in a club or something you're like all right this  you think like this better be good right like you judge them a lot more harshly than you do a guy  uh you kind of get bumped when there's a a female yeah yeah yeah it used to when a female was the  middle yeah yeah you're like ah i want to talk about her period with her overbearing mother again mom 
[00:49:00]  that wanted to get married oh they all did the same it was the same material that would be a great  montage all the female comics back in the day doing their periods i'm like don't worry mom i'm finding  a guy oh oh shit they finally got away from that most of them you hang out with aren't that fun like  mo in our lives as guys growing up your buddies always made you oh yeah once in a while you'd have the  woman but most of us didn't have funny female friends growing up so when you see a woman right 
[00:49:30]  and uh she almost has to prove more to you but you have to women have to realize too part of that is  just our experience growing up we didn't have the the type of interactions it was never other guys  who told us don't cup a fart and throw it in my face right it was always a girl getting mad at you  like that so when that stops the attitude about a woman going on stage will still you know what i mean  they're like why do i have to prove myself part that's just our experience growing up yeah let's 
[00:50:00]  go to matt in detroit matt yes this gawker guy is full of shit well yeah all right my point is uh  during the don rickles episode right at the very beginning seinfeld says the mount rushmore of comedy  includes richard pryor and bill cosby don rickles and george carlin george carlin right that was the  four he mentioned yeah of course of course he has a lot of jews in there too but you know 
[00:50:30]  i've noticed with this web series it's i'll say it again a lot of guys he came up with that he's  very close with and then he went with some old timers like don rickles and um mel brooks right  reiner and reiner sure all right matt thank you sure i wish we could look this kyle guy up and see how  many black people and it may be a lot please how many black people have been the subjects  of his blogs again it could be eighty percent but i'm just curious is he as diverse in his writing 
[00:51:00]  as he would expect or scold somebody for not being in their web series i am sure not they are this guy  is the same just type of hypocritical douchebag let's try to get him on the phone are we trying  yeah we're working on it all right good i believe you are uh patrick in michigan patrick hey what's  going on guys hang on just calling about how you know if you look at it this way jerry never brought  up the whole the whole race thing to begin with at all and then this comedy guy just starts looking 
[00:51:30]  up all these comedians as even sorry um maybe whoever not because of their talent but because of their  color so doesn't that make him the one well that's the liberal way to do it right yeah he basically  created exactly we see all these pc assholes have their heads so far up their ass they don't see  they're creating the problem yeah thank you i was just gonna say the exact same thing this guy created  a problem that wasn't wasn't even there wasn't even there holy who was outraged no one 
[00:52:00]  we're outraged at jerry come on yeah we seinfeld has gotten criticism yes oh fuck the criticism  you know you don't think he wants cosby on his show of course he does maybe he hasn't been able  to get bill cosby yet right all right yeah especially if he thinks he's one of the four  greats of all time yeah prior's unavailable right um calling unavailable unavailable murphy probably you 
[00:52:30]  know ernie murphy probably not doing it and he did rickles so let's say hi to peter on long  island peter morning boys good morning peter oh delightful we're talking about female comedians  before i always thought wendy liebman never really uh blossomed into what she could have i think she's  very funny too and uh apart from that i would marry amy schumer in a minute yeah we're not talking about  her we're not really talking about nowadays we're trying to remember some of the some of the female  comics from the past that actually were yeah really funny like well like wendy liebman's a good call 
[00:53:00]  because that's a good one yeah who's that other one that used to hang out with emo phillips that was  up um uh judy tanuda judy tanuda i didn't get i didn't get that act either not a fan i didn't get that  act either can i hear some judy tanuda judy tanuda just a random clip oh yeah all right let's go random 
[00:53:30]  oh she's got her accordion doing the act  hi pigs  i remember that  you know my name is judy and i have my own religion judyism is she retarded  yes soon you will all be my personal love slaves 
[00:54:00]  but first but first let's go back in time  you know i'm trying to leave a normal life  hold on pause this question don't forget though this is like eight i'm guessing early 90s right  and it was a weird yes kind of avant-garde thing i hear you but i would be pissed yeah i don't know  if i would enjoy it even in the 90s i'd be sitting there going oh no i would be pissed i don't want to  be here 
[00:54:30]  no not what do you think this is early 90s i think this is late 80s uh maybe even earlier there's some  people there with some fucking there we go okay 80s uh dues all right we don't have to  subject ourselves listeners to that shit yeah losses yes yeah uh i i gotta say yes this 90 day  fiance show oh yeah i am so in on this show oh yeah how many episodes in are you um how many how many 
[00:55:00]  have they shown i think um five or so don't say five because i only have the first four where can  you see them the latest well rolling rolling sent out an email where we could you know do the old  password kind of you know click the link put your password in and watch it on the old laptop yeah tlc  it's on tlc i am all it's just fantastic the dude in cleveland and i have a a strange feeling that he's 
[00:55:30]  probably listens to this show yeah i was thinking he fits the mold like oh does he fit the mold  actually all these guys fit the mold except for the la guy and the oklahoma guy this four guy would  be offended by some of the comments he absolutely listens to al kim very mysterious he likes the old  mystery stories on the radio can we run down the couples again yeah you guys four couples yeah which  one you want to do first uh i think we get out of the way you can't get the filipino girl out of 
[00:56:00]  the way because that story is amazing i thought that was the throwaway story but it's not there's so  much richness to all let's start with the filipino so the guy from where where are they from again um  indianapolis somewhere in the midwest all right i love how they bring these broads to america and they  and they bring them to an amazing city before they have to go back to their not so amazing house  the shitty little backwoods bumpkin there's so there's so many little things going on in this 
[00:56:30]  show so he goes to the philippines to find a wife and uh he's got two kids yeah and he's got an ex-wife  that is a nightmare she's a bruiser who reminds me of someone oh boy yeah her attitude reminds me of  somebody i had to sit in a courtroom with you see it too right oh yeah was that a lady yes if you  want to get an idea of um and it's ex-wife yep well this broad that's her attitude the attitude not 
[00:57:00]  the look but the attitude absolutely the attitude so this guy has two fucking boys he can't find anyone  to date so he does his online it's a mail order bride definitely and they everyone calls him out on it  yep all these guys on and they're like no you know it's a dating site and no no no it's not that  so he's a bit desperate and he finds this yeah he finds this filipino woman and she's being dragged 
[00:57:30]  to america to to hang with him his two kids and an ex-wife that is a nightmare yeah wow this guy's in  hell that's the first one uh-huh and that one is absolutely not gonna work out no i mean even the  ex who's sitting there the ex-wife is like the minute that this chick is in america from the  philippines the ex-wife is like i need you to know that i know you might think i'm butting in but those  are my kids right yeah and i and it's when she's a bruiser she is she looks just horrendous arms full of 
[00:58:00]  tats and that fucking dumb hairdo she's got yeah the retard bangs and the fucking oh god she's a  fucking monster so it's got to be a wig she's a monster what else about that couple well they're  not terrible none of them like nobody in the whole package is terribly attractive which is unfortunate  because all the other 90 day fiance brides are attractive right well the one looks like she could 
[00:58:30]  be like uh one of those uh russian widow what are they called again black widows like a black black  widow she looks creepy yeah she looks like she could easily kill people yeah yeah we'll get to  them in a second anything else on them um that's pretty much it yeah oh oh she she shows up oh yeah  the house she shows up at the house finally after this guy you know gives her a night in chicago yeah  and then he has to go to this like just horrible like just apartment that is attached to a million 
[00:59:00]  other apartments yeah and she walks in how she was living in the philippines she was basically living  in a shantytown uh-huh she walks in this guy's house and has an attitude already that the house isn't  clean she's bitching that the house wasn't clean well the guy also i mean he goes he spends a week in the  philippines then he brings her to chicago to spend the night and they get home and he didn't wash the  dishes before he left for the philippines a week prior the dirty dishes are still in the sink start 
[00:59:30]  training her what what the to do right you don't like it start cleaning up and they go immediately  shopping and she's picking out all this stuff and the guy is pretty much having a nervous breakdown  because he's looking at the prices and he basically admits that he can afford his bills and that's  about it so he's telling the the lady at the clothes uh the clothing store to and i can't i can't afford  these this is there anything cheaper and they had to go in the back of the store so she's not hot 
[01:00:00]  no oh she's like she's terrible like she was chosen she's way hotter than the ex-wife though oh yeah but  that's not saying anything because she's a two but she's nothing compared to the other girls right but i'm  sure that he brought her in because he thought that she'd be impressed with what little he had  uh-huh and like i'll be saying she's forgotten about the shantytown oh yeah immediately upon  arriving and she's never going home never like the other broads they're already missing home and stuff 
[01:00:30]  but this one is not going home and the guy when she was waving goodbye to her family she knew she'll  never see them again and she's okay with that and the guy's got his awkward chuckles when he knows  things aren't going well he's like yeah we uh we cover the old couch with a sheet there's a hole in one of  the pillows but you know we got kids so i get a new one because she's just looking at the couch like  i'm not going to sit on that she's like he's a regular blue collar guy just trying to just trying  to make ends meet and he brought in this bra that sees america and she's going to take advantage of 
[01:01:00]  everything that america has to offer yeah are there like clips of it uh very few why well why don't they  show more they got some clips what what clip is this this is a clip of the couple we're uh talking about  okay we've seen the other clips but we haven't seen this yeah let's play this one right jimmy so  he's so he's on board  this is them coming back from the philippines 
[01:01:30]  no no no being in chicago is kind of like a little vacation figured we could relax and just show  her around a little bit a little vacation one night plus it's like summer in chicago which is  one of the as chicago in the summer is one of the best oh yeah cities in the country yeah it's  definitely not indianapolis or wherever he's no where he's dragging her off too well the other couple  that we'll get to he brought her to new york city and then they had a drive to cleveland oh boy 
[01:02:00]  no offense to cleveland but a bit of a drop off if you're showing a broader route it's a bit of a  drop off if you go to akron first right anyway go ahead never been to a city as big as chicago  and you never will again no it's exciting chicago is nice it's a different environment to me but  being with lewis all the time is being with my best friend all the time can you go back one 
[01:02:30]  second after that kiss yeah it doesn't look like she enjoyed that no watch watch her back i want to  be a bad brother i could just be wrong they're not they're not around with this show it's pretty obvious  that uh out of the four broads i would say three are doing it to just get to america the great thing  about the show is that there's not one enjoyable kiss no because three of the chicks don't want  anything to do with it and then the fourth one the dude doesn't want anything yeah yeah 
[01:03:00]  and the cleveland guy did you see the episode where he's trying to make a move  and and she goes what are you doing oh yeah kissing you it's like hey but he's doing it like  he's still trying to be cheeky about it he's like i'm i'm kissing you you know that guy deserves  i don't like it that guy deserves everything that's going to happen to him yeah he's a  his name's mike i think right you know the cleveland guy a sucker go ahead  cago is nice it's a different environment to me but being with lewis all the time is 
[01:03:30]  oh yeah yeah she's like my best friend all the time you see her face she winced it was literally  she would have been happy to kiss a a a dog's paw  he was i guess he had like maybe he had the crusty breath or something but she made a really winced face  yeah it's called a k-1 visa i guess and you got 90 days yeah to you know be in america but you got  to be married by the end of the 90 days or you got to go back that's but what happens is the culture 
[01:04:00]  shock because they met all these dudes either online or like she sees this guy in the context of  him being an american in the philippines yeah so he'd be hot but then they bring him back to america  and she's looking around chicago and realizes he's a bit of a dud this guy's a zilch he's the mayor of  zilch city the other couple where the broads becoming a model oh my god just a just a simple  mormon dude oh dude i am so obsessed with this show he is a nervous nelly about letting anyone 
[01:04:30]  talk to her yeah wow that's the girl from brazil a tiny little town in brazil she doesn't know anything  and uh they're in la the guy's the guy uh yeah he's from la yeah and even then and and she went  and got her hair done we can do this one we could jump around a little bit it's probably easier to do  it that way so he takes her to get her hair done and the the lady's like jesus you can make a lot of  money modeling and then she comes out yeah she comes out of the the hair cutting place to show the the 
[01:05:00]  the guy the card like model mother she gave me number she gave me number i said i was very pretty  it could be model and then i'm fast forward in my head she's going to be on  it's the sports illustration issue with some fucking athlete the new it girl just  fucking and the guy's response is just i brought you over he's trying to hold on to his broad and his 
[01:05:30]  hair at the same time his hair is basically falling out on tv and she's only been there like  six days both of them are leaving at an alarming rate exactly yeah she's but she can't speak english  and she needs him for everything but but this modeling thing is just gonna turn out ugly because  she's quickly turning out finding out that he's not cool she they're all they all find out the guy's  mormon yeah the guy they're with is not cool yeah and so he brought this hot little brazilian chick 
[01:06:00]  over to his apartment to live there and the first night he had one of his friends come and stay in  their apartment to act as their chaperone because he doesn't believe in intimacy before marriage and he  doesn't know if he could control himself being you know in that situation he probably just didn't want  her to steal all his shit he didn't trust her he was afraid her and her sticky fingers would make  off with his goods but then i'm up to the episode where that guy got a job or didn't want to be the  chaperone anymore right so now this guy is moving this broad into his parents house by herself though 
[01:06:30]  by herself yeah so they could be separate but he they they don't even have an extra room at the  parents house so she's uh she's uh living on a pullout couch yeah while the guy just chills in his  apartment it's ridiculous i see more clips you want to see the filipino yes i do i do are you in on  this yeah i mean and i i i've been studying this very closely and i i do not believe that this is  fake no i'm not feeling any uh this is a fake the one girl's crying like crazy because she's missing 
[01:07:00]  home and and the russian broad you can't fake that you see it in her eye she has no desire to be with  this guy and she's doing it to come to america i guess you try to get a work visa and that failed  so that storyline is really good this is just a way for her to you know right stay in america and  the family is like telling the guy well don't you think it's a little uh concerning that she's tried  to get visas before and failed right no no i don't think so yeah do you think it's like like the 
[01:07:30]  producers may suggest the chicago trip why don't you take a look oh of course of course yeah yeah of  course not to put nothing knowing she'll want to buy you that he can't afford the producers are  probably like know how hot this little brazilian girl is oh and so they probably put her up to go  getting made up and they might have even put fake the model thing like you know right put her up to  going and meeting with a model but they probably didn't tell the sap that no why would you do that  action let him be all fucking nervous right scared oh he's losing her oh he really is really quickly 
[01:08:00]  make it bigger sam i want to see it pretty  i told i i wanted to buy her some pants or something like that so that she had something  from here hi how are you fine how are you doing good thank you a real nice clothing boutique  nothing worse than having to stand around while a girl shops in a 
[01:08:30]  fucking girl definitely not an everyday thing that i hardly buy anything name brand but that's  just how i am i've always been like that though you don't mind looking at other ones you don't mind  looking at other ones do you everything in the back is on sale okay  and even those prices he's panicking over like i don't know this one's okay  okay okay okay how much are the black ones i did not check it let me check most filipino think that 
[01:09:00]  people here in america rich  louis is not rich you picked the wrong american she's pissed because this guy's checking tags she  just assumes you go to america and no one checks tags everyone's rich and it's not like he went to  the philippines and made it clear that he was not rich he wanted to oppress people right so he's showing  off yeah he's showing off a little bit oh my god being a big man on campus oh yeah bmoc 
[01:09:30]  it's easy to pretend you're rich in the philippines right so these other guys went to brazil to meet a  girl yeah i said most of them met online okay online dating did he go to see her or he flew her in  i think the brazilian one i'm beginning to think this is a great idea for me but i wouldn't go to  a country i wouldn't want to be set up you know i think the brazilian one he met on like a language  website where they would learn and they were no that's the russian oh right the russian one they  met on a language website right and then they started video chatting right he wanted to learn russian and 
[01:10:00]  she wanted to come to america that's why they're on the way that's why they're there i don't know why  the russian wanted to learn russian but she was on the site they're just they're just waiting in the  water they are just waiting for a sap is it easy to bring a hot russian chick here you think dude  you got to see the brazilian chick this guy is so out of his league oh wait to see what she looks like  stunning supermodel look easily could be a a massive model and then the fourth couple that we haven't 
[01:10:30]  really talked about is the colombian chick oh who looks like a sex doll she's built for sex but yeah the  guy appears to be a closeted homosexual the guy just is a bit mysterious that's my it's just you  know my opinion but yeah you would know and and they're living they're living at his parents house  as well because he's trying to save money and this broad like safe money i'm an american get me a  goddamn apartment where are these rich americans and he doesn't have enough money for the apartment but 
[01:11:00]  he goes and gets it anyway so now he's in debt the colombian chick is worse than she is because like  he takes out he's like we're going to get her cowboy boots today because they're living in  oklahoma and she picks the most expensive pair of cowboy boots she wants the most expensive  apartment in oklahoma she wants everything money money let's go out and party let's let's oh no it's  fucking an officer and a gentleman i'll be floor manager at jc penny in two years that's why this  show's great because it's all that jimmy it's all that she uh uh and she's living at the parents 
[01:11:30]  house before they moved out and she comes down basically in lingerie and now yeah now the dude's  mom is pissed because they're really religious they're very religious and the father's eyes are  popping out of his head because he's got this hot colombian sex doll she's amazing and the dude has  to be like why don't you uh why don't why don't you put on a robe before you come and then the mom goes  yeah that would be a good idea and she just she's just she's from colombia and the minute this chick  came off the plane from colombia all she's wanted to do is get a dick like she just wanted to have 
[01:12:00]  sex with somebody she's ready to go and the guy is like almost like a parody finding every excuse  possible to not be physically and she sneaks into his room because she's in the brother's room and  also is like but my parents room is right downstairs shut up come on you gotta you gotta go back and  there's a small cock it might be something like that like the guy's a really tiny cock he's mysterious 
[01:12:30]  he has a lot of symptoms he just seems yeah he comes off as very uh gay as soon as she gets to  the hotel she's like i'm going to take a shower maybe we take a shower together right and he's like  well you know i don't i don't know do you really want to and he's overcompensating he's got a massive  guy's truck yeah you saw that wears a 10 gallon cowboy hat into the yeah hot tub and then he takes  her line dance and she's like what the is this she wants to hip-hop her ass off and she's just shaking 
[01:13:00]  her ass and then he and then she meets her his friends and all she wants to do is drink tequila  and they're all looking at her like what's wrong with this broad and she's a party girl her quote was  i don't know what brunch is but when i'm nervous i drink she just started ordering mimosa after  mimosa and she that's great she can barely keep her tits in the giant natural and then she wants them  out then they put then she goes on the um the electronic uh bull you know yeah yeah yeah she's  just working and every guy has stopped stopped doing what they were doing to watch her oh and i think 
[01:13:30]  that's the couple we're going to have on yeah they're going to uh call in tomorrow yep oh i got  a can i watch this tonight yeah yeah we got the email i think yeah i think you'll love it i know  you're not a big reality show guy but this one if everyone likes it i'll watch it great there's  something about it all these little little nuances and stuff and every girl in oklahoma hates hates  the colombian girl oh yeah because she's so hot sure and exotic yeah she's got big tight breasts and 
[01:14:00]  you know they're not implants and they're hanging out she's got a colombian ass yeah she's got a big  fat ass that she just wants to shake anytime she can and she loves just low-rise jeans and shaking  her ass and she's like a dick in her she really wants a dick so bad you fast forward and all these  girls will be with other people it's so obvious yes none of these guys will be able to hang on to  these these girls this girl looks like an asian mc mars yeah all right so back to her so she's bombed the 
[01:14:30]  filipino broad now moving on to the other couple everyone in america americans were and she's  realizing that she's got a dud that doesn't have a lot of money he seems like a nice enough guy to  he's a very nice guy he has saps yeah i don't think you will waste money for me  these are 240 i might have to go with something a little cheaper for being so patient i've talked 
[01:15:00]  to i about my financial needs just that i'm able to afford my bills but i don't have a ton of extra  money afterwards oh why are you in chicago yeah don't go into a boutique to buy jeans that's why  they sent them there yes because chicago is an expensive city boy let's go in here they're like  yeah why don't we send you guys in there to shop you guys pay your own stuff but we'll pay for your  hotel and they order room service they tell her why don't you get some room service 38 dollars for a 
[01:15:30]  burger i buy most of my clothes at a target uh yeah you know they fit so i don't see there to be a  problem like that comfortable comfortable rugged rugged is there more to this clip oh yeah they're in  chicago still yeah i wanted to have the last i love his voice too yeah yeah i wanted to have a last 
[01:16:00]  little bit of time to ourself before i uh has to meet the kids they can't wait to meet you  are you worried or are you worried about meeting the boys parenting is a whole new world to me i feel  under a lot of pressure but if the boys like me i don't think we're going to have problems i'm  excited to meet them are you you know her eyes are looking away yeah she's not excited he goes he goes 
[01:16:30]  do you have goosebumps and she's not even making eye contact she goes yeah yeah yeah sure as she said  i'm excited to meet them her eyes were completely off to the side that is such a tell that someone's  lying she'd be more excited to meet immigration officers escorting her back to the philippines  she just realized how good she has it in the shanty town i was queen of the shanties where i come  from right sure i shit into an open sewer but at least i didn't have to look at his face 
[01:17:00]  and raise his kids they're going like yeah i have goosebumps over meeting your kids are the appetizers  coming right i think that might be trump's hotel by the way it looks like it right by the hotel by the view  yeah and um that is funny they put him in a nice hotel that he can't even afford on his own but  she doesn't know that and then he sent him shopping but didn't give him any money for him money and  then she's got to see how really broke he is why don't you guys go out look around then one of the 
[01:17:30]  girls is saying to her mark ask him for some jeans just taking her aside and he's such an oaky he doesn't  know that he's like one guy's talking to him and the other one's whispering her ear you ought to get some  jeans get some great place up there you're saying you're saying the producers are making this an  exercise in humiliation yeah i think they're totally egging this whole thing on yeah they're egging it  on they know what people want to say assisted reality is the best ever yeah yeah i think when  they're assisting it by just show like guiding it slightly i like yeah with this a little yeah that's 
[01:18:00]  fine they're guiding the rats into the trap right yeah yeah because you're not coaching this dude  right to do anything he's being himself well keeping up with the kardashians they just got  lazy they'll that's that's scripted that's maybe they'll show the broads just all on their blackberries  and then one will go hey let's go shooting today oh yeah really all right yeah that's what you were  going to do that yeah because they can't think of anything by themselves right so everything is set  up for them it doesn't look work like it did with the osborns where you could just put cameras 
[01:18:30]  and they're actually interesting works yeah but people are watching that kardashian show still  unbelievable i don't know why i have no idea you hear the rumor that bruce jenner is absolutely trying  to uh turn to become a woman i think i i yeah i think that's what the fuck is that he's going to  shave down his uh adam's apple did you see the pictures no no yeah his face looks like they're trying  to femme it up or it started out i thought as a goof but more and more people are starting to say i don't  know if this is a goof yeah yeah i think he's actually gonna turn into a woman try to become 
[01:19:00]  a woman where's the uh there was one up with a bandage on it or something right um oh he just looks  weird oh he really does yeah but there are some pictures that came out recently he looks very  feminine catalan winner i know oh boy that's just oh whatever go back to the filipino broadcast we'll  find that for later oh she's excited to meet the kids there we are you know she looked away as she said  it of course you think she has goosebumps no i don't know not even due to the weather 
[01:19:30]  are you you got goosebumps yeah they keep telling me they can't and that's the this that  that sentence is the desperation of every guy on this show when he says are you excited to meet them  and she kind of rolls her eyes and goes yeah yeah and he can't let it go and just admit to himself  what's going on he goes yeah you you got goosebumps maybe i just misinterpreted what she said let me  ask another question and she's just pissed she's like i picked the wrong one you never say do you 
[01:20:00]  got goosebumps yeah yeah that that if somebody has goosebumps it's apparent and they'll say oh i got  goosebumps from thinking about that if you're touching if you're touching their genitals and there's  warts on them you could pray like do you have goosebumps right but that's that's that's the  desperation yeah of what's going on on this show yeah they keep telling me they can't wait to meet  you i've prepared i for the boys the best that i can by letting them talk to her on video chat making 
[01:20:30]  sure they get comfortable around each other the best that i can before they are actually physically next  to each other here's to getting to america safely and to the next months until we get married and then  for as long as we are together can you go back over that awkward hand motion oh wow fat thighs  he is a nervous nelly because he so believes that's why i don't think this show is fake no he's all in 
[01:21:00]  he's the worst he's the worst toast anyone's ever given yeah for as long as and he thinks he has  found his soul mate and she's thinking fuck this guy sucks he's thinking he has fat thighs and his  hands on his hip and he's like no no she she she doesn't think i suck i don't i don't think she  thinks i suck they are not even close to being on the same page not even in the same book he's like 
[01:21:30]  thinking she's gonna be mama son to the kids right and she just wants to fucking you know she wants to  blue she wants the 250 dollar jeans right the best that i can before they are actually physically  next to each other here's to getting to america safely and to the next months until we get married  for as long as we are together which hopefully is forever and ever  we are given 90 days to live together to make sure that we don't absolutely drive each other crazy

[02:00:00]  take to move the clothes around i could get him right out of the dryer and hang him up he's just  fucking in the morning in the cold basement getting changed right going to work like his  his cold feet on the cement floor clothes are cold when he puts them on as he has a ciggy yeah  wouldn't you have a guest room where he could just put his clothes in there for now no i think  he only has one room in his dream house dream house with a full bed and probably ashtrays all

[02:01:00]  and ken ham that little uh debate they had well everyone's talking about science and science  creationism yeah evolution creationism um it it really is i don't know if embarrassing is the word  when you watch somebody that's like ken ham so religious trying to talk about science  because it's it's ludicrous yeah they're just dope it doesn't go hand in hand and he was trying to 
[02:01:30]  make can i stop you for a second yeah sure because i know there's going to be uh we're going to be  all in on this for a while bill burr's calling oh billy that's right and he sat through our nonsense  for like a half hour oh man uh mr burr we uh we apologize for not picking you up during that uh  amazing radio segment we just did hello i enjoyed it i enjoyed it so bad for the guy just just your  descriptions of him and his hope and just how she was just uh oh yeah just by the audio it was never 
[02:02:00]  happening happening and she was leaving on the 91st day oh man it is a great show because i i really  feel like every guy has been there we've all done that with a girl that you just know you're out of  your league and you're just doing everything hoping it's going to work out holding on for dear life  holding on for dear life man so i was actually trying to think like what he could have done  to make it happen and he doesn't have enough time to get in shape or to develop a personality 
[02:02:30]  the only thing that involved was just threats he could threaten her right and that only lasts so long  yeah she'll figure that out too crying underneath you really just gets rid of their beauty oh  shit yes the weeping underneath your weight sure  find the system as they're hanging their heads  and then we were um sagging into this uh debate that aunt saw last night oh yeah yeah did you see 
[02:03:00]  any of that bill the bill nye uh ham debate yeah it was a religion uh and uh science as far as  creationism and uh evolution goes was it on youtube the debate yeah it was on youtube yeah it was the  number one trending topic on twitter for a while there last night and just watching religious guys trying  to debate science is really ridiculous no matter how far back you go they'll just who who created the 
[02:03:30]  material to make the microscope yeah yeah and then when uh bill nye would say something like well we  don't know that and he goes i know it because i read a book and that book is the bible is it really that's  your answer but that book was edited it was left out a whole bunch of stuff from that book yeah it was  ridiculous i the people only watch that because they want to see the religious guy look like an idiot  that's exactly what it was the only reason to really enjoy a good and he did of course he looked like a  complete idiot of course where are you mr burr one of the best lines i heard in one of those debates 
[02:04:00]  was one time you know they had the religious guy and the science guy and the religious guy goes well  what about this and the guy goes well we don't you know we we don't know that yet and then the guy  goes well there you go that's full blah blah blah blah you know the higher power thing and he and the  guy just goes look just because you you don't have the answer to a question yet doesn't mean it deserves  the supernatural explanation right but yeah it's really kind of something i'm not saying that you 
[02:04:30]  know there isn't something or whatever but like right it's just every religion is just it's just made  up by people it's like it was developed around a campfire or something yeah yeah it all reads that way  it's not this divine word of some greater fucking entity uh i love scientology oh yeah i just love  listening to people go like how the hell can you sky run and blah blah blah blah just say out loud what 
[02:05:00]  you believe yeah it's like my story i actually do a bit about this where i just basically i my religion  i believe a woman that never had sex had a baby and it walked on water had endless buckets of fish died  and then three days later came back you know like hey just just messing with you what's up everybody  exactly it's they're all just ridiculous stories there's proof that that guy ron existed 
[02:05:30]  oh l ron hubbard yeah yeah yeah there is proof this video yes some lovely photos of him in an ascot  yes you've ever seen uh yeah yeah that's the most believable religion there is yeah scientology when  you watch when you watch that shit that religion when they're trying to debate it it's they the  the religious people will take the science and try to pound it into their beliefs and the scientific 
[02:06:00]  people take uh what they see and the evidence and actually change their ideology based on the evidence  not the other way around they're so closed-minded that you can't have an honest very religious  creationism uh scientist it just doesn't work they they're opposites well nobody wants to hear that  when you die you just go into the ground well yeah and then that's it yeah yeah you live and there's 
[02:06:30]  lollipops for everybody i mean i'm not saying that's like look i'm i i just wish they would just  say listen we have no idea what happens but we kind of have this vibe that you probably should be  a good person right you know just to hedge your bets just in case there is somebody who created us  and all the evil in the world but for some reason is blaming us for it  yeah i mean none of it works out none of the math on any of it works out other than like i like 
[02:07:00]  the ten commandments and i like the seven deadly sins um that makes the most sense to me and then  the rest of it you know it just you know there's such a caveman yeah pretty much there's just such a um  there's such detail to what supposedly happens to you uh after you die and you you know your right  hand of god and all this stuff and and there's no evidence to back up any of it and yet they'll take 
[02:07:30]  it makes sense they'll take the evidence yeah god was talking to like was in full communication with  regular people yeah and then just you know just hung up on us and it's just i don't know yeah he used to  hang out a lot apparently he'd come down give people tests and you know wreak some havoc and  shit like that is basically uh you know wait till dad gets home yeah that's basically what it is oh 
[02:08:00]  he's gonna you better make sure you make your bed when dad gets home it really does boil down to that  yeah you you gotta be good um or uh-oh you're in trouble when when he gets back with pops yeah  right and meanwhile my religion they break every commandment they've just broken and then none of  them seem nervous none of them seem nervous about going to hell or anything and they've done you know  they've been and they've done horrific things that's that's a great point yeah why aren't they sweating 
[02:08:30]  profusely knowing what's what's going to happen to them because what they did because they're in the  castle and they know that yeah at some point they just sit there and the oldest guy there goes uh  you know yeah it's all it's all but enjoy this castle they gave us it's wonderful yeah because  wouldn't you be shaking in your boots thinking of an eternity of damnation for what you did right if  you really truly believed it yeah yeah i think if you really believed you wouldn't be touching kids 
[02:09:00]  like that right no no hey uh the business comes first everybody right hey bill uh i know it's a little  too late it's a few days now but what any uh any uh any thoughts on the super bowl you're a big you're  a big sports fan i like i like getting your take on sports you loved it i loved it even even though it  was a blowout i loved well yeah i did because i got this weird thing where i i really like peyton manning  but like they're for some reason but i don't know they do they always just say he's they they wanted 
[02:09:30]  to say that he's the greatest quarterback of all time before he even had his first super bowl ring  because of he throws for 9 000 yards in november right and um i don't blame the entire loss on him i think  they were out coached and and a number of other things that wasn't payton's fault but didn't the  whole team look panicky to you the whole team just looked nervous and not ready well i i mean i 
[02:10:00]  don't know the guy from adam but he gets a look on his face when he goes down in a playoff game  early on in the game and maybe i'm reading into it but his body language he just looks like he's  not like he quit but he's just like great right this is how it's gonna be and like it's like the end  of the first quarter he gets that look on his face but who knows i'm just a idiot comedian but  i will tell you this i i figured out the magic number on how to watch the super bowl 
[02:10:30]  you you basically you record the game you hang out with your friends only you only invite like three  four people that really give a shit about the game you let the game go for 90 minutes shut off your  phones and all that you let the game go for 90 minutes we turned it on hour and a half after it  started dude we didn't watch one commercial we we fast forward through every commercial every  challenge flag every injured player the entire half time we watched the whole thing in two hours 
[02:11:00]  and we almost finished basically maybe like five minutes after the rest of the world  yeah right yeah and then the second the game ends and they're just like and p carol  tell it out on the field you just shut it off wow you don't want pam oliver and all those people  on the sidelines all of that crap and then you can actually stay in the excitement of the game 
[02:11:30]  right right because there's so much extra crap going on and i gotta tell you too when i um you know at  at the end of the game like um my wife came home like an hour afterwards and she watched it somewhere  else and she's like did you see the halftime show with bruno mars and i was like no no and then she  actually rewound it and i watched it because i already saw the game i could actually sit down and enjoy  that rather than getting annoyed that this crap for 45 minutes was interrupting the most important 
[02:12:00]  football game of the year wow you don't like nonsense no nonsense for bill no he doesn't have time for that  shit you don't you don't get involved with the commercials everyone talks about the commercials  on monday though oh that's the worst that's why super bowl parties are the worst people talk during  the game and then they shut up during the commercial and then the game comes back on and he's like  how do you think that one caused how do you think that one was that good well whatever happened to him 
[02:12:30]  he's doing commercials i can't argue with that i like that so what 90 minutes is the buffer  uh you need yeah all you need to do as far as sports center goes is i mean espn goes all you  need to do is watch sports center and then you just have your thumb on mute right for when somebody's  going to yell in the middle of a home run yo my boy blue or you know yeah quote some stupid movie like 
[02:13:00]  i don't know espn i swear to god i think those guys i don't even think they're human anymore i think  they just like animatronic androids yeah yeah they're just sort of these  fucking creepy looking people like uh like that creepy good looking in suits yeah  i don't know i'm a jaded sports fan you certainly are you're a jaded uh pretty much everything jaded  human being no that's not true i have a lot of positive thoughts it's just not a lot of it exists in 
[02:13:30]  the how they broadcast sports yeah yeah well that's a good idea i'm gonna have to  pull that one next year what espn used to be like watch the nhl channel right on right on  hey it just looks like they have this giant room in this little desk and there's like two employees  yeah and the vancouver can not just had a game against calgary last night  but they're gradually becoming slicker and slicker with each year and they'll ruin it are you uh are 
[02:14:00]  you a fan of outdoor hockey they they kind of they kind of went crazy with that this year  yeah they got to be careful because careful they've done what like six of them this year or  something they used to do one outdoor game was kind of cool and now they had two at yankee stadium  alone this year i i think i still think it's cool but they got a uh there's you know  there's one of those there's definitely the hokey line where you get you can start to cross it but 
[02:14:30]  i don't know dude i i i love hockey and i hope um they continue to keep getting close to being  popular and then shooting themselves in the foot like they always do it just stays a distance for it  because it really helps the sport where you know they don't they can't afford to do a lot of the  crap that like like uh what football is doing right now that's off roger goodell's ego where he's the  same way as like a stand-up comedian you try to be the best you can you're competing against the people 
[02:15:00]  in front of you that guy he's competing with pete rosell right he has to somehow outdo that guy and  that's why they have that dumbass game that they play in london every year they're going to try to  they have to try to make it global yeah like soccer i think so that so they can be like and rob  with the dolly he was the guy who brought football to turkey  just so he can hang his hat on something because it's just like how many 
[02:15:30]  fucking teams do you need yeah i don't i don't see it that'll never happen right now  i don't i don't see it catching on in europe i mean they're going to the game obviously they're  enjoying it but when that wears off the novelty of it i don't i don't really see them so fixated  on soccer it doesn't matter yeah i don't know they've tried to make soccer work in america some  would say it is working in america i don't know i i just can't stand this guy one time said to me  the funniest about soccer and he goes he goes we already have that game in america it's called 
[02:16:00]  hockey it's a lot faster and it is whenever i watch soccer i'm just like this is hockey  yeah it escapes and everybody's running around so true so true yeah no one wants to like soccer in  america you do like it you're getting into it what what what turned you on it the time i don't have  the time to get into it right but if there's a premier league game or something like that uh  i still soccer it's a lot like hockey where there's a bunch of people who who think it stinks but then 
[02:16:30]  if you actually go to a game you're like wow this is a whole this is a totally different thing  i might have to try that i cannot get into it i guarantee you this anthony if you went over to  england and you went to a premier league game yeah you would be like this is insane just listening to  the crowd singing the songs and yeah yeah with your glass of wine feeling like you conquered a  country well i do enjoy some hooliganism a little hooliganism that is the only scary part about going 
[02:17:00]  over yeah yeah crazy motherfuckers yes where uh where are you right now i'm in los angeles oh  you're home you're home i did i went to the pro bowl like a week ago or so whatever the hell that  was they got well out in hawaii and i always wanted to go to the pro bowl were you able to  just walk up and get tickets day of i'm sure i could have if i want it seems like nobody talks 
[02:17:30]  about the pro bowl but why would you want to go to the pro bowl except for the fact that it's in hawaii  it's in hawaii and then also i just love the whole caddyshack vibe of the game where it just  doesn't matter yeah you know when i was younger it seemed like every you know the announcers were  half in the bag sitting there with these those stupid lays around their neck like nobody it's just  a fun fun team to get into you're out there in hawaii dude it's like uh remember when you know you 
[02:18:00]  had a day job that wednesday before thanksgiving it's a half day even the boss is in a good mood  the good old days at the end of it or something it's just fun it's just fun all right  yeah i had a good time i ended up doing i did a segment for uh inside the nfl and i got to go around  talking to uh some of the players but i i just made sure i i just talked to offensive linemen and like 
[02:18:30]  place kickers and guys on the chain gang just because the whole bit was you're the best  of the best like how did you get here yeah yeah i filled up the gatorade things it was it was a  great time just the fact that it's uh that they moved it uh before the super bowl really proves that  no one gives a fuck about it oh yeah they almost can't they almost like canceled it like uh telling  players that you have to try this year you have to try yeah because why what what what it's not in 
[02:19:00]  their best interest to hurt them yeah but who wants to blow out a knee for that game that's what  i like man it's a testament to how tough that game is that you can't even just have a uh like you can  even like hockey for as tough as that game is but if you just you can play non-contact it can still  be kind of enjoyable to sit there and watch it but like football it's like you have to tackle the  guy right has anyone had has anyone had a career ending injury in the pro bowl i'm sure yeah that 
[02:19:30]  would be there was a guy in the patriots they uh they had i forget his name but they they one  year decided to do this rookie game where the rookies played this game on the beach in like  shorts like two antacho like flag football and somebody uh the patriots a rookie blew out his knee  and they never had the game again oh my god what about the actual pro bowl though like a a a good  player a name guy has he ever hurt himself to the point where it's like oh great i ended my career 
[02:20:00]  at the pro bowl i don't i don't i don't know i but i had no number of people talked about that  patriot guy when i was there and nobody remember his name that's great i don't even know his name  anymore oh the game was great the game was a great game because they had deon sanders and jerry rice both  shows up side they didn't do afc nfc oh okay like old school gymnasium uh fucking rules yeah and they  actually there was a numbers stretches where they actually were playing competitive football and in 
[02:20:30]  the end jerry rice's team drove down um was down scored a touchdown was down by one and just went for  the two-point conversion and got it the deon sanders team comes back and there's like no time left and  they're on like the i don't know 50 something not they're i don't know they're on their own like  45 and they attempted a 67 yard field goal this place was going nuts like this is going to be for 
[02:21:00]  the fucking records it was good people like i thought i get kicked out at my section he got kicked out at the pro  ball how do you do that no way you gotta be drunk  ran out on the field i swear to god it was a full 35 seconds before any security person actually  turned around to see what people were yelling about she was like running out of players to like you know  that where you jump in the air and bump into each other yeah just sort of standing there she was like 
[02:21:30]  running out of players to do it when the ball's caught when somebody runs on the field is when  they when they make that break for the opposite end field goal and the crowd starts cheering like  it's an actual play like he's gonna make it it was a great time it sounds like it good for you  like in hawaii yeah yeah have you ever been to why it's this old ass stadium they don't they have 
[02:22:00]  like two atms in the entire fucking stadium so there'll be like 50 people in line and just the  technology of it it's like you almost mentally go back in time like you're just like i should have  bought some bread man  some bread man  no i i i had i had a and then in the end you're like in hawaii yeah yeah great 
[02:22:30]  there's no reason not to go so you really went just to go to the pro bowl  yeah good for you yeah did you do any surfing in hawaii  man you know bad i'd love to surf i just i have uh i have a couple of huge fears in life and  the ocean is one of them i am absolutely  fucking i'll freak myself out in a pool sometimes i just don't think about 
[02:23:00]  like i would never swim in a pool in florida  i just wouldn't what alligator well you never know if an alligator slid in there right yeah  i tell everyone that it's scared of the ocean you got to go scuba diving once and you realize  everything is fucking scared shitless of you oh it doesn't matter i know a shark's gonna bump into  every once in a while and take a bite but in general you're extremely safe in the ocean as far as  creatures go i don't know but i mean you could tell some of that a million times no disrespect don't be 
[02:23:30]  you're you're a you're a radio guy  but then again he would have been like well opie said it was safe but then again if i'm at a beach  and it's dark i'm not fucking going in the water hell no so yeah i i love swimming and that type of  thing and like um but when i'm in the you know frolicking in the surf the second i can't i have to  tread water and i can't touch the bottom yeah i can't handle it are you just freaked out yeah are 
[02:24:00]  you afraid of being sucked out too with that uh the riptide yeah that's scary browning the worst  thing ever is being sucked out you're still swimming just either waiting to die of hypothermia or  waiting for that shark to take the bite to see if they're edible and it's like is that  fucking thing coming back yeah the the bite that you don't see coming by the way no idea  i guess you're right bill yeah it's fine and a surfboard is probably the smallest thing you 
[02:24:30]  could possibly be on in the ocean at least you're out of the water though yeah you're out of the water  that's true but that white bottom of the surfboard looks delicious to a shark yeah everything's  delicious to them thinks it's a nice seal belly i would go with tuna yeah i gotta i got a boogie  board a few years ago and the only ones left were the white bottom ones no one wants to buy those  because they look too much like seals oh you oh is that right yeah everyone else grabs the ones with 
[02:25:00]  different colors so it throws them off a little bit but the white is bad in the in the ocean  yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of shady i actually talked to a number of surfers when i was  out there like um about that type of stuff and they're just like yeah you know like every once in  a while you see a shadow go underneath these cool yourself it's a dolphin oh my god yeah yeah  fuck that why why can't scientists figure out what color sharks fucking hate and make the surfboards 
[02:25:30]  that color well i mean i don't think whatever they could figure out i mean the that's why i would  never go into the forest or any of that i mean you know the woods is scary enough but all you got to  deal with is perverts and fucking serial killers you go into the woods i mean a forest like you know  when you start talking like bears right yeah yeah lions and god knows what the fuck else is there  snakes and shit it's just like it's amazing we survived we talk about this from time to time we're 
[02:26:00]  all grown men we think we're brave you pull off to one of those trails let's say in new hampshire  they're all over the fucking place it's pitch dark how far does bill burr walk in before he's scared  out of his fucking mind and is now running back toward the car how far do you think you can  make it for real for real pitch pitch black forget it how about broad daylight oh even  i went out to the place out here big bear right oh yeah and i guess there are no bears that's what 
[02:26:30]  they say but then every once in a while they just spot one so we're out just going up this  fucking trail it's just the two of us you know we were on vacation so it was like uh it wasn't a  weekend it was like a tuesday so we're the only one on the trail and my wife is a city girl and  she starts getting freaked out and starts panicking like not liking how deep into the woods we are  and then literally her panic starts feeding into my brain and i'm trying to sit there with my 
[02:27:00]  stupid chin of bear mace no laughing out of my hand like a backup quarterback  like lawrence taylor remember that lawrence taylor would pounce on you from behind just  fucking slap the thing down oh yeah that was his move he loved that you're a bear mace we we got all  the way up to the top and we finally ran into somebody who was on like a mountain bike and was coming back 
[02:27:30]  down and it was weird the way the trail had serpentined all the way up we were way higher up than our car  yeah we weren't that deep into the woods but it just felt like we were and then i gotta tell you dude  like you know i started looking around um and i'm just like i'm we're we're you're freaking yourself out  yeah you just start seeing right now what am i what in god's name am i gonna do right with my  stupid can i mean all i'm gonna do is make the thing matter you'll wind up spraying the mace the 
[02:28:00]  wind will blow it right in your face now you're blind and and you can't breathe and a bear is eating  you yeah that's basically like throwing paprika on a fucking yeah yeah it's like this one tastes like  jalapeno yeah you're self-seasoning when i spent time in la i i i kind of hiked some of those uh  mountains or whatever but the ones where there's not a lot of trees or anything and all they have is 
[02:28:30]  one lousy fucking sign that says watch out for mountain lions and even though it's it's it's a bright  sunny day not a cloud in the sky you're out of your mind with fear and i remember thinking why am i doing  this this is not fun and you really start seeing that's not there you start really panicking  you want to stay with the pack i got one three i was taking my dog for a hike uh yesterday right  and there was like it's like four helicopters i saw flying really low and it was just and they  were over the park so i was saying to my buddy i'm like are they like training pilots today or 
[02:29:00]  something like what's going on then these two cops go by on horses and we're sitting like why are  they on this trail those fucking horses are shitting all over the place and it turns out they  were looking for some guy who did something to somebody in a motel oh god he went to the park  and i'm laughing because those guys on the horses went by without me even knowing they looked right  at my face to be like is this the guy who was sitting in jail for the rest of our lives 
[02:29:30]  thinking is why are you walking by on your horses this is so annoying  some rapist yeah wow that's scary yeah now they go by you and you're like well did you check  every rock around here because i'm still out here that's the thing about la la will lull you to sleep  because it feels like this giant suburb and you forget that it's a uh that it's a city yeah i live 
[02:30:00]  i live in a nice area but like la doesn't go like really nice to you know it's all the way you know  miles and miles miles and it gradually goes into one you know either nicer or worse yeah patchwork  where it's like this area is nice three blocks over this is a fucking knife fight and then you know  george clooney lives here you know it's just like it's it's totally random and i'm always reminded of 
[02:30:30]  that uh during halloween when just the the fucking all the different people that show up  from rich kids up the hill to the check cashing people down the street you get the it runs the  gamut i feel like i need to get a gun more than after a night of halloween  that is weird man yeah being spread out like that he's right i like it i like knowing uh i'm in a  i'm entrenched in a good neighborhood do we got a surfer on the line you got it you got to feel like 
[02:31:00]  you're the safest guy in your neighborhood you had you know just knowing that you're the gun nut on  the block right like well i'm not going to do x y and z yeah my neighbors are all afraid that i am  going to do all of that right it's just let them think you're going to do something crazy they'll just  leave you alone exactly you get nervous waves as you drive down your block yeah hi oh that's him 
[02:31:30]  don't talk to him they grab their kids a little tighter don't start a friendship  i like it that way hold on a minute this surfer wants in badly uh you're on with bill burr mike  in florida what's up hey good morning guys how you doing hanging with bill hey bill hey yeah me and my  buddy were out surfing a few years ago right after a storm and about an eight foot bull shark came up and  he was paddling back out just about back up in the out in the lineup and his arm went down his mouth 
[02:32:00]  and he uh basically bit his arm off it was hanging there just by like some tenants and stuff and i  helped him back into the beach and it was about a year and a half later and uh he was able to get  fully rehabbed but it was pretty traumatic because it all happened about like 15 feet away from me so  it's like we know they're always there did it bite the arm totally off or just was taking that  let's see if this thing's edible and just mangled it well see he it would be like sticking your arm 
[02:32:30]  down in a purse and slap uh and slamming it shut right so the arm was down the throat and the shark  clamped down on him and the tail was he was thrashing out of the water the guy was laying on his board  because he was you know paddling back out but he was holding on to the board and the shark was trying  to drag him under it finally let go of him and man i am bullshit this thing fucking took off about  100 miles an hour went about 15 feet from him did a u-turn and came back at him and i was like oh  shit this is going to be the end right here and it fucking bumped that dude and we never saw it again 
[02:33:00]  so i paddled over him i told him grab onto my trunks i paddled him in went banging on some condo doors  got 9-1-1 down there it left seven teeth in his arm and the marine biologists were able to determine  yes it was about an eight-foot bull shark that got a hold of him c was angry that day my friend yeah  yeah i mean you understand that you're involved in a sport where getting eaten alive is a possibility  oh yeah that's yeah but come on and that's true that's why we call 
[02:33:30]  pussy on fucking golfers and shit they get all this money it's like  motherfucker all right today they're surfing bonsai pipeline the vulcan pipe pro  you guys turn it on live on the internet and you'll see what these warriors do  oh this guy's crazy into it they're they're surfing over the three foot deep a number b it's  fucking razor sharp coral if you dive that area when it's flat when there's no waves you'll be  tripping you'll be like oh shit people are going to surf over this and see the goddamn waves are 
[02:34:00]  fucking 30 feet tall man i mean oh man imagine somebody uh this is the deal a mounting  thing think of somebody basically emptying five olympic pools on your head at once  pitted pile and pile so pitted into a right into a reef i mean it's pretty crazy when you think about  it and yes they were telling stories about guys you know they like every year like world love world 
[02:34:30]  champion level surfers will drown they're like i think that's why they lost the guy like you just  you know you fall off your board the wave pushes you down yeah i get just that's when you're pitted so  pitted and this is precisely why the space industry has pursued big wave surfers in addition to um  shields and special force people because these guys have got their head in a special place and  they're able to deal with things i've never heard of the uh of nasa no it's surfers 
[02:35:00]  think about think about you're underwater you're getting pummeled by the wave you don't know which  way is up you're still keeping your head and your wits about you're like i got this thing as soon as  like you know this thing releases me i'll look for the light i'll swim up it'll be you can hold your  breath in space too if you you get out of your space suit you could hold your breath yeah i'll say  yeah yeah you ride those waves right back through the atmosphere there you go i think he loves surfing  he loves it you love it this guy loves surfing another thing they have kind of figured out this 
[02:35:30]  shark thing with the fish they found out the reef fish that are striped like black and white stripes  the sharks for whatever reason they feel like those striped reef fish have the big dorsal fin with the  spines on them so they don't like to basically go after them and they have found a very very high  percentage of of sharks will be turned off to that stripe pattern so you can buy these giant stickers and  throw them on the bottom of your board look like giant they look like the biggest kook ever like

[02:40:30]  fuck we're hanging out with him and a police dog for after the uh show the other day oh yeah that was  flawed um so yeah so it was confirmed that flea was not plugged in at the super bowl yeah i guess  they recorded it uh beforehand and what's the statement they're basically blaming the nfl right  travis yeah i mean he basically said that this was presented to us in this fashion and the nfl doesn't  like to deal with live instruments during the super bowl because there there's so much uh there's 
[02:41:00]  a chance that something could go wrong and why deal with bad sound when you can deal with a guarantee  that it's because it's a live band and if something goes wrong who cares does that  mean everyone's turning off their tvs i don't know people pay millions i like a little dirt i would uh  i like a little dirt when something's a little off right they're like oh listen to that oh someone  fucked up i kind of i kind of like uh watching live events hoping that something fucks up something  fucks up and i i know it's a big spot to be in you know your flea and your 
[02:41:30]  the red hot chili peppers yeah but wouldn't you just feel like an idiot if you're up there just  like with a air guitar basically yeah you'd have to feel silly yeah he likened it to uh just filming  a music video in front of millions of people yeah yeah okay right yeah because they do the same thing  when they film videos sure but uh i don't know i would just feel i would have to think in all the  years the peppers have been around they've never done that before uh he said that they used to on mtv 
[02:42:00]  right i guess for mtv performances yeah yeah yeah and then he said that they swore they'd never do  it again oh well i guess until the nfl comes a calling i guess i mean how many people saw that  super bowl that's a lot of eyes on you yeah people say i hear they don't get paid for that though right  i don't think so no which is really kind of odd but but i think i mean it's the exposure factor  people buy your album mars albums went up 168 it's crazy yeah i don't think it's not at all because  the red hot chili peppers probably sold a shitload of units after their appearance it's just weird 
[02:42:30]  people go oh red hot chili peppers oh i gotta download all their stuff now yeah they had plenty  of opportunities yeah it's just weird how our brains didn't know i'm gonna do that too you know yeah  sometimes like oh yeah let me download oh okay i gotta download that now i don't know so yeah the  prime example is uh the the song at the end of breaking bad the last episode yeah like everyone wound up  downloading that it's an old song i think the best example is is journey with the song god journey  again with sopranos don't stop believing yeah i'll download it people decided sitting there for 
[02:43:00]  years at that point so many people decide wow this is a really cool song yeah but it's always been a  cool song for most and not only some people it was like number one on right yeah yeah hey what's the  breaking bad song because i i i'm not i'm breaking bad blue uh what was the name of it something blue baby  blue baby blue oh baby blue by bad finger might be blue yeah by bad friend friend that was the one  by bad for her friend bad far that's it bad that's a great song yeah that was a good one i'm a big fan 
[02:43:30]  of day after day myself but oh boy i'll do a little spoiler shot oh they did it live what or is this a  video ladies and gentlemen bad finger who's that oh my god that looks like kenny rogers that was an  old video kenny rogers not a hint of gray hair yet oh yeah this is live right yeah definitely 
[02:44:00]  is this video so bold all that time  kind of a eric clapton thing going on there  i didn't know you think that i didn't forget 
[02:44:30]  it's not that good lies  it sounds all right  jesus what year is that so a shitload of people downloaded this  shitload no kidding i think this is a little different though because like my generation i  i didn't know about this song yeah i never yeah me neither huh i'd never heard this song  existed before breaking bad oh you're wow really you wacky little kids oh that's adorable  that is adorable what are you guys you know day after day no i don't think that was a big hit for 
[02:45:00]  uh bad finger they had some tragedy tragedy right bad finger did they what happened to bad i  think they had some problems oh boy i believe if it's the band i'm thinking of uh might have been a  suicide or two or two yikes i think help me out here sam is going to the wiki which is uh  wiki wiki wiki wiki wiki and what happened the feminists are all about like changing wikipedia or 
[02:45:30]  something are they what they don't like it oh i guess uh problem oh you got the story i felt running  it yeah yeah looks like uh they were on the beatles uh label apple pete ham uh killed himself yep  i guess he was the singer yep whoops and then one of the other got what he deserved  why did he kill himself i was tired of being pete ham why and then uh one of the other guys uh evans  evans somebody named tom evans saw him the body oh and then couldn't get over it and stop performing 
[02:46:00]  i guess right that's the body like walked in or you know some at the funeral or something and you're  skipping the part that evans then killed himself i'm looking for the longer i'm telling you there's  been that tragedy jesus yeah that's crazy had a couple good hits so that guy that singer right  there he's he's gone yeah and the beatles you know they were backing these guys for a while 
[02:46:30]  how'd he do it uh one of them i believe hung himself yikes i believe and ham i don't know i i i  i want to say he shot himself whoa i think you're still going on the two suicides here huh yeah why  sam roberts can't find it no no there's two suicides for sure yeah absolutely two suicides yeah  evans evans and ham both you just said he stopped performing and then we know and then opie said the  thing oh and i thought that is a fact i didn't need to confirm opie he's the guy oh well i need a 
[02:47:00]  verification from wikipedia oh yeah evans evans killed himself he hung himself damn once again i  believe opie i'm looking for the details but i believe him what are the other guys doing now are  they uh wishing uh those two guys didn't kill themselves yeah i bet it's about all god that sucks  see uh that didn't happen to super group asia no no they're just found out evans hanged himself  i said that eight times prior to what you just said you know i want to know a little bit about 
[02:47:30]  some of these bands wikipedia you know you gotta oh and you know what ham did what also hanged  himself while i was there i thought it was a gunshot wow that was a hanging kind of a pact that they  have i don't know gee and why well evans uh well we know why evans  no this was much why ham evans was late much later than him i know why ham ham started this  shit okay because because evans got depressed over the ham one so why ham okay on the night of uh 
[02:48:00]  april 23rd 1975 ham received a phone call from the united states telling him all his money had  disappeared what that's a terrible phone call from who black magic is wait a phone call from the united  states yes so how do you get that call hi i'm the united states oh my god he's gone  disappeared a little shady and he doesn't get to see the bicentennial that son of a  bitch it was a hell of a display with all the ships the ships what later than i wait a minute 
[02:48:30]  for my father i'm a child of the 80s bicentennial was seven i'm a child of the 80s i heard things  and i saw pictures i didn't see the bicentennial either it wasn't 1786 new york well 70 i was in  california i was i was alive in 76 but extreme wasn't extremely young well extremely young forming  memories driving extremely young fucking soccer later that night tom wait later wait go back so 
[02:49:00]  the united states called him yes yes the united states gave him a phone call and said all your  money has disappeared ham received a phone call from the united telling him his money disappeared  what the fuck is that it was the world's strangest phone call had disappeared okay go ahead later that  night he met tom evans and they went to a pub together where why is he dragging evans into  this nonsense i don't know why does he keep that to himself they figured they'd just hang out that  night ham drank 10 whiskeys 10 whiskeys and oh i like that he drove him home at three in the morning 
[02:49:30]  3 a.m i'll swing you home and and then ham hanged himself in his garage studio uh later that morning  on his suicide note addressed to his girlfriend and her son well uh he blamed polly for i don't know  who polly is apparently we should read a little more of this article for much of his despair and  inability to cope with the disappointments in his life the note read and i love you blair i love you i 
[02:50:00]  will not be allowed to love and trust everybody this is better pete p.s stan polly is a soulless  bastard i will take him with me stan polly he probably took his money oh stan polly took his  money looks like he's uh yeah the management guy in this here's what you do though why not  kill stan polly right right first and then you could you know do whatever the you want but 
[02:50:30]  at least you you got a little of that what they call revenge right and someone is pointing out that  the two guys that didn't hang themselves are the ones that should have hung themselves  i think evans and ham were the uh the main guys in badfinger we certainly know ham was because he  was the lead singer we got a good line on on eatman i don't want to i wonder i don't want to get that  phone call from the united states yeah the united states called opie and anthony and said uh-oh i don't  need the united states calling me no i got bills to pay you know what sex did did that come up on your 
[02:51:00]  fucking uh caller id uh yeah united states call like oh there's a call from the united states i'm  just gonna let it go to voicemail oh yeah that's really gonna go to go to voicemail right if they  both just relaxed and waited about 40 years yeah they would have gotten a whole bunch more money  because breaking bad you're right see right i mean i don't know what they would have done for 40 years  that seems like a while hunt down that fucking stan polly motherfucker that's right that's it 
[02:51:30]  so he could have said a cool line like he could have had a crowbar and been like polly want a  cracker in the skull and then hit him in the head or something well let's go look up stan polly yeah  now we need to know what stan because this is 75 so stan polly by now has to be dead and hopefully  it was in some horrific way if he did uh ham and evans wrong right all right see we're we're from the  future right right i love being from the future we're looking at this with futuristic eyes too bad 
[02:52:00]  we can't tell uh oh ham and ham and evans that everything's gonna be okay stan polly go ahead  he lived to be 87 years oh my god there's no justice in this world keep believing in your god  oh you know karma will get you 87 i love the karma will get you people really karma dude really  polly took evans and ham's money and to the point where the united states called them to tell them  your money this guy gets to live to old age how did he die peacefully looking at the ocean 
[02:52:30]  surrounded by loved ones and children and great grandchildren yeah let's go in 1991 polly pleaded no  contest to charges of misappropriating funds and money laundering right uh in california aeronautics  engineer peter brock accused polly of swindling him for 250 000 to set up a corporation to manufacture  airplane engines how did this guy this guy just kept he just kept people people is there is there 
[02:53:00]  a story about uh his involvement with the badfinger guy yes okay let's see wait wait but continue  polly was placed on probation for five years in 91 and ordered by the court to return all missing funds to  brock although the complainant said the restitution never materialized he got probation and paid nothing  back nothing happened to him wow in 1972 he negotiated a record contract with warner brothers for badfinger  which called for advances to be paid into an escrow account oh uh-huh in 1974 warner's publishing 
[02:53:30]  division filed a lawsuit against polly when it was unsuccessful in locating the funds that's when  the united states called and said his money disappeared right the legal morris uh-huh crippled badfinger  financially right ban leader pete ham pete ham committed suicide in 1975 right leaving behind a note  pointing the finger at polly for his financial ruin and that mother what happened to that nothing nothing 
[02:54:00]  this guy's the teflon don yeah he uh he went with that escrow uh put it in an escrow account what what  what in 1971 before the badfinger thing even happened right before ham and avans killed themselves  because the united states government called them to say they had no money yes okay uh polly was named as  an intermediary between unnamed crime thing figures and a new york supreme court judge wow most of polly's 
[02:54:30]  american clients said they were already suspicious of their manager by this point but the publicity of  the hearings convinced several to sever ties with him so he's got this okay and then he goes to  fuck badfinger and then he goes to fuck peter brock who just wants to build some airplane engines  i don't blame polly anymore badfinger should have known should have done a little uh research there a  little uh due diligence they deserve the united states calling them to say they have no more money 
[02:55:00]  oh my god no they said your money disappeared right because there was the signs were everywhere  that this uh stan polly was not a good guy and how did the guy with the airplane engines yes not do his  research at that point 91 91 20 years later killed themselves and you got some mob dealings and  shit and you're like yeah i'll give you a few hundred g's for this these airplane engines yeah and i'll help 
[02:55:30]  you out just give me the money and then he's like okay i won in court now you're gonna pay me back  right and he goes yeah yeah you got it yeah unbelievable that's the story of badfinger could  you know that now let's hear day after day oh just to bring it all together nice for the people  fuck stan polly anyway you know how much the guy who sings this song made off this how much nothing  he killed himself nothing not a dime yeah oh stan polly stan polly when i was finding out about him 
[02:56:00]  we got the call from the united states what did the united states say yeah well he said your money  this is all around yeah yeah i wonder where the fuck his money is  oh my empty room really yeah everything's gone there's no money in there that's no more day after  day that guy in cleveland's dream house looks better than this guy's right oh 
[02:56:30]  i give my love to you and money too oh boy loving money to you oh boy this is this is grim when he  first wrote this song he was just thinking to himself things are going great i got money i got  a great manager fast forward he's hanging himself oh man how did the other guy see his body let's find  out what happened to the other two guys that decided that they didn't need to hang them yeah let's do a  whole fucking behind the music where are they now right all right we already found out two of them 
[02:57:00]  dead right stan polly dead after a long life of a wonderful life of no fucking problems of no  fucking karma whatsoever none i was reading about the only one that's alive right now yeah it's joey  molland yeah and he still tours as joey molland's bad finger oh god damn no and he had no idea that  breaking bad was using this song right because uh it's uh he didn't write it so his estate dealt 
[02:57:30]  with with it and he's just watching the show and he comes on oh so should be stan polly's  what if ham and evans hung in there eventually they would have got paid for their baby blue song right  yep because they would have cleaned up all that nonsense that stan polly put through that's right  they would kill stan polly hey what uh what did that guy play that's still alive uh i think he's  the bass player the bass player lives on the guitars oh the guitars okay all right do we have any audio 
[02:58:00]  of him trying to do bad finger songs without ham and evans uh i always love hearing that yeah maybe uh  maybe there's some live joey molland's bad finger on youtube you want to try to find some live joey  how do you spell his last name m-o-l-l-a who cares all right m-o-l-l-a  oh man a-n-d what a tragedy yeah m-o-l-l-a-n-d  let's see how did joey molland sing it day after day oh perfect all right let's see if it sounds 
[02:58:30]  similar without hair what year is this from 2009  we're getting close to the end now so oh boy yeah i really feel like a beer tonight it's honestly  god i can't tell you how much i feel like a big  can't say that don't say anything about beer on stage joe you know it drives people mad  to the point of suicide anyway so coming down it was a big giant hit for us all over the place 
[02:59:00]  and uh our guitar player at the time fellow named peter ham he started falling in love with girls and  writing songs about them oh boy look at that  uh-oh game of beer and then stan polly  anyway so yeah peter started writing you know the guy that hung himself and that guy no no no 
[02:59:30]  the other guy that hung himself yeah that was a lot of great tunes and god he's going to play slide  guitar phones almost like george did on the record and uh hope you like this all day after day  very similar to the record but he has no business singing this song  i guess george harrison played the slide is that what he meant yeah 
[03:00:00]  this poor bastard this is no good  it's a lot of effects on his microphone  he's got a lot of backup help yes he could be really low when he's down yeah yeah 
[03:00:30]  it sounds like he's singing over some uh background yeah tracks too right  you got to give it up broski he's just singing away the dead guy song  he has no emotional attachment to this hey we're gonna learn something here uh today mike in new york 
[03:01:00]  mike yes sir hey uh yeah i think you guys may have covered it already but uh you know both pete  ham and tom evans hung themselves what no yes over the course of a year or two due to the fact that  their manager stole all their money what who was their manager uh uh i don't know i have no idea  what's the story behind it yeah uh well they were on apple records which the beatles owned 
[03:01:30]  george harrison had helped them out and had actually the slide guitar on that record that you just  played yeah is george harrison playing guitar on it really he actually yes i've never heard that  before holy shit at least in the last couple minutes holy shit wow yeah and you know in the early to  mid 70s they would play arenas and come home from tours with no money where's all our money and the 
[03:02:00]  manager would go uh i don't know and then he split with millions and millions of their dollars did they  get like a phone call to tell me i had no money yeah that money disappeared or something yeah they  went to call their manager and he was gone he left the country oh man wow weird was their manager like  a shady guy why didn't the united states call well that i don't know okay uh yeah his manager uh what  was his manager a shady business man well i guess it turned out that way didn't it it was probably the 
[03:02:30]  only time he did it though he probably learned his lesson and let me tell you a joey mollen a recent  joey mollen story sure good who's he now who's that guy he's the last surviving guy there's only one  left there's only one last guy and now he tours it's like we asked for an oral report of what we just did  right right it's an oral report sorry yeah and he tours as joey mollen's bad finger and wow that's 
[03:03:00]  what he tours as yes oh my god so he uses the bad finger name but he says joey mollen's bad finger  and how does he sound is there i don't know clips of him singing or anything probably but i know my  my brother actually played drums for him and he said he was really good oh really he also interestingly  enough a friend of mine is a school teacher up here in rockland county and he had joey mollen  come in and do a presentation for all these middle school students for like two hours and they had  no idea who this guy was of course too bad you weren't there you could have told him everything 
[03:03:30]  twice uh i wasn't but my buddy did videotape the entire thing so he's got all right wait a minute i  think i just found a clip really of joey mollen's bad finger oh do you want to hear it absolutely yeah  what's he what's he singing they did a so i guess they did a song called day after day yeah sure  that was one of the big bad finger hits yeah okay yeah this is actually from 2009 right mike oh  jesus that's about right yeah 
[03:04:00]  oh yeah that familiar sound but that was george harrison on the record right seems like you know  just yesterday i was listening to this sure what are the original guys doing five minutes ago  sounds like 
[03:04:30]  like live from the countdown  you know you could probably get him to do it probably good now that i listen to this for the  first time yeah it doesn't sound that good no no it's all right there mike he's old oh yeah i think  he's missing the guy that might have hung himself it's just one of them right yeah two guys hung  themselves how do you know so much but you don't know who the goddamn manager is right i don't know  look i'm good at rock trivia what can i tell you you're great at it you're just not good at listening 
[03:05:00]  rock trivia you're a horrible i'd be great at rock trivia too if i just heard it right  no the problem is he's a horrible listener he's a horrible listener you're a terrible listener sir  all right mike i was on hold for a while thanks listen listen the replay you'll laugh your ass off  he was on hold that's where you hear the show of course what is he doing yes the show that's another  thing the show is on old of course it is like you can't avoid it no because you got to keep it to 
[03:05:30]  your ear because you never know when we're going to put it down and turn on speaker but you're going  to hear everything that was astounding i've never had a caller that where where he mentioned so many  things that we had talked about merely seconds before it just shows you we did a great job oh yeah  he filled us in on everything we said and can you go back to the wikipedia page because i i hear that  uh the listeners are adding to the bad finger wikipedia page hey where does the wiki from 
[03:06:00]  wikipedia come wiki wiki wiki do we know is there an answer to that question check wikipedia why didn't  that fucking guy have that yeah check wikipedia wikipedia page on wikipedia wow that's a finger's  page is weird man well sam's looking for that if any of our listeners want to go see  joey mollins bad finger tonight oh he's playing at a famous dave's in minnesota he's at famous dave's 
[03:06:30]  on a wednesday night in minnesota all right bro that's better than being evans or ham you're you know  what i'm not sure you're right about that oh wow wow but this is how great we are we just made bad  finger very fun to listen very popular and fun fun to listen to oh here's here's the the wiki thing uh  don wickland as a matter of fact invented wikipedia very cool and that's where wikipedia came from say 
[03:07:00]  don wickland tribute site yeah don wickland are the listeners adding do you have to go all the way to the  bottom how does this work i don't know i don't see uh people speculating uh famous dave's is probably  in the mall of america up there is it true i don't know oh wait what about the plaque that's kind of  nice what uh oh joey mollins wife kathy mollin died on march 24 2009 oh and stan polly died on uh july 20th  2009 oh joey mollins is stan polly outlived joey mollins wife oh man what an asshole she's probably 
[03:07:30]  polly and she probably just wanted to live long enough to see him die and she didn't and she  didn't in april 2013 a blue plaque was unveiled to honor pete ham in his hometown of swansea  wow the event was attended by two former members of the ivies ron griffiths and died jenkins oh my god  what an awful tribute oh that's horrible uh a concert followed the unveiling of the plaque featuring 
[03:08:00]  former bedfinger members bob jackson and al wad key or something like that that other guy didn't go  i guess not so there's there's three guys that were still around were right okay you want your  wiki answer yeah yeah wiki means quick in hawaiian and wiki websites like wikipedia and wiki answers  run on wiki software which allows for collaborative editing and easy creation of pages ah all right
