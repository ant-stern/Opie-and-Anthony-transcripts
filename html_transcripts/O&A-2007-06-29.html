<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, originating live from the Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut, began with technical difficulties, including a significant echo and loud music, prompting self-deprecating jokes from the hosts about their lack of preparation. The show, promoting their upcoming comedy tour featuring Louis C.K., Stephen Lynch, Patrice O'Neal, and others, featured a mix of pre-planned segments and unscripted audience interaction.  

Gambling experiences at the casino were discussed, with one host recounting a small win followed by losses.  The hosts engaged in extensive banter with various audience members, including “Air Guitar Friday” and “Mispronunciation Friday” segments.  Audience participation was a key element, with numerous individuals sharing personal stories.  “Earl” detailed his preference for larger women and his dating history. Kevin and Nicole discussed their upcoming wedding.  Debbie, a recurring caller known for her extravagant hairstyle, candidly shared details about her dating life after widowhood.  A man who flew from Miami to attend the next day's show was interviewed, along with several women from a local gentlemen’s club.  The hosts also interacted with the general manager of a strip club and other staff members.  

Throughout the broadcast, the hosts frequently commented on the audience’s appearance and behavior.  Opie shared stories of infidelity during his marriage and recounted past encounters, including one with two women in Montreal who turned out to be lesbians and proposed a threesome, and another involving interactions with "Kalua girls" during a previous weekly gig at a promotional event that resulted in regret and embarrassment for Anthony.  Anthony also recounted potentially problematic behavior involving "Kalua girls" and skinny dipping.  The death of Chris Benoit and Lindsey Lohan's legal troubles were also discussed.

A large portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls and emails detailing explicit sexual fantasies and experiences, often read aloud on air. These included accounts of brothel visits, a 12-person orgy, and a listener claiming to have two holes in his penis.  A listener's detailed fantasy involving Rod Stewart was discussed with Debbie.

Audience members competed for comedy show tickets by performing unusual stunts, like one man repeatedly kicking himself in the head.  A news clip of a child repeatedly saying "I like turtles" was played.  A segment briefly touched upon a transgendered seven-year-old featured on *Paula's Choice*.  A significant segment focused on George (later identified as Ashley), a child who transitioned from male to female, discussing the child's emotional struggles, parental responses (with accusations of Munchausen syndrome by proxy), media coverage (criticizing journalist Paul Is On), and the hosts' contrasting this with Opie's own father's negative reaction to him playing with dolls.  This was punctuated by numerous sexually explicit listener calls and emails. The show heavily promoted their upcoming motorcycle run and addressed behind-the-scenes issues, including censorship and lines being cut from their broadcast.  Comedian Louis C.K. was mentioned as a scheduled guest for the following day.

A later segment featured a caller's recording of his son’s emotional outburst while playing video games, which prompted amusement and derision from the hosts and audience.  The conversation shifted to video game addiction and parental responses.  A call with Debbie's boss, Blake, involved joking about Debbie’s work habits, lack of sex in eight years, and her distinctive “mullet” hairstyle.  The show concluded with promotions for upcoming live shows and a “Line of the Day” segment containing numerous off-color jokes.  The broadcast was rife with vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor throughout.

[00:08:30]  and uh just around yeah we went out to uh didn't we go out to lunch or something with the guys and  it was friday and uh e-rock was just being pointed at and laughed at for no reason just because it was  friday and it's a point and laugh friday i think it's because we were at an eatery  yes we were eating so anything he put in his mouth we were laughing at it and if he would have  uh refrained from putting all that in his mouth he may have won that bet yesterday against dr  ian smith but he didn't as opie was saying he was stupid because he should have just fasted for two  days well yeah i mean uh late in the show yesterday we finally weighed e-rock he had a month and a 
[00:09:00]  half to lose 20 pounds to to win 500 from dr ian smith and uh he was two pounds short even less than two  pounds i'll bet you that dummy did fast i'll bet he lied about sticking with you know you said he  stuck with the diet he probably lied he probably hadn't eaten in like a week because he had like  six pounds to go and he probably just could lose four and couldn't get the last two that's how  stupid e-rock is i'm so disappointed because i was working him i was like his manager behind the  scenes i'm like dude you can you can get something on these guys finally because it's no secret these 
[00:09:30]  guys beat up e-rock on a daily basis i'm like all you have to do is lose 20 pounds in a month and a  half you'll finally have something on these guys and you're gonna walk away with 500 yeah you get  just a tiny bit of respect he comes in two pounds short from winning the bet two pounds and i told  anthony if if uh if uh if i'm doing the bet if anthony's doing the bed if jimmy's doing the  bed we're gonna do whatever it takes to make sure that uh we get the job done especially if you're that  close throw the book away and stop eating i would have had water pouring out of me let's just put it 
[00:10:00]  that way to make sure i won the best yeah and the dope we ask him about he goes oh i was following  the diet to the t right to the end i'm like what what are you dumb he's lying he was eating butter  cookies up until the last week and then he tried he's probably vomiting four times a day the whole  week before that nervous idiot just purging bulimic douche yeah it's also uh so we did air  guitar friday mispronunciation friday point and laugh friday and after the show yesterday uh jimmy 
[00:10:30]  decided on a new rule for fridays oh no a new rule for when we're on the road yeah we i figured we  had suggested something else that was going to happen today and we couldn't do it because it  was a friday so we decided it was going to be road rules friday i figured that would get the crowd in  a frenzy now this this is ridiculous because what road rules friday is is if we're on the road all the  daily rules get thrown out the window and you could do whatever daily rule you want so in essence it's  just going to end up being cat noise friday yeah because stupid jimmy of course oh now they applaud 
[00:11:00]  loves cat noise don't buy into jimmy's crap that's what they're here for they understand the cat noise  is very valuable and that's why they come it draws people from all over cat noise wednesday but since  it's it's it's road rules friday you could take all the friday rules and throw them out yeah and it  could be whip them out wednesday yeah it could be yeah yeah that would be really lovely well i think  we're allowed to you know have flashing here because tom's nowhere near the casino 
[00:11:30]  well he'll send a croupier here to chastise us i bet you right now tom has his shirtless men  running around the studio this is the way i want it absolutely you know he's gonna appear just to take  the fun out of the broadcast from a casino how do you do that well tom will figure it out now i know  it's kind of hard with the live audience i guess we'll get to know you guys as the show goes on  because you'll realize that we not well we have nothing prepared so we're going to rely on you  so we'll try to find out if most of you guys live here uh in the area or did you 
[00:12:00]  oh live in the area okay in the surrounding area well we got danny out there he's working  he's working the crowd to see what they got for the show today ah danny and uh and then uh we'll see  what he comes up with and then we'll figure it out from there by the way we're uh being heard on the  wolf locally yes 104 7 up here in connecticut and uh jimmy and i thanks to julie who was giving us a  tour of uh the facilities where we're going to be um uh doing the tour tomorrow night which is an 
[00:12:30]  amazing arena then we saw this yesterday afternoon and then we went to the radio station they got a  radio station right here in the casino and it's in a glass booth it's really creepy it's like uh it's by  the parking garage exit they gave them really good location you just watch fat people walking  with no money back to their stupid suvs and horse trailers that they have to climb into  god almighty what's in the water here chocolate donuts i've never seen larger people  you're looking at a few jimmy no no these people are fine believe me i did a quick visual none of you 
[00:13:00]  can compare with the i think mammals we saw walking out last i've never seen fatter people while their  legs are moving i think they're alive it's kind of indicative of a casino crowd though a lot of  people you know they they're over indulgent oh yeah well they have that personality that makes them  want to gamble and eat well there's there was something else going on yesterday uh anthony that's  what we're getting they're betting on how many more times their heart beats yeah before it just stops  so so julie uh brings us to the radio station and and jimmy and i decide and club soda kenny we're 
[00:13:30]  going to go on the air and there's this guy djing and he didn't want anything to do with us you know  what's that yeah he ended his shift like 40 minutes early just so he didn't have to talk to us on the  on the air i don't want to associate with those people jeopardize my job it might have been that yeah  there was something going on he's a mellow guy he just wanted to play tunes he wanted no part of  that this nonsense and uh has anybody seen the actual station here it's a it's a it's a glass window  that people can actually look into and you can look out of really exciting stuff you're kind of in a 
[00:14:00]  fishbowl yeah and you see a dj just sitting there with curly hair pressing buttons i mean  it's just riveting for hours people have watched it's kind of like this except we're in the same  room you are and uh there was some folks outside the uh that might not have been um genetically the  brightest how could you tell um the haircut not only the haircut the licking of the window that we were  broadcasting from well yeah inside there was a little group of retarded people uh standing in 
[00:14:30]  the little area there we kind of knew that they were retarded so we were hello we said hello and  you know i got a few phone numbers and we were cordial right jimmy let's move on why not they're  people yeah we were polite and then we uh we walked into the broadcast and uh we're chit-chatting and  one of them we of course avoid mentioning that on the air well of course um because two of them  walk up to the window and one is looking in the window the other one's kind of leaning he's a guy 
[00:15:00]  but he's leaning seductively on the window and i'm like he's a guy and he's retarded and i think  he's hitting on me and it you know it was good how did you not how could you not say something  well you're staring i don't know why don't you look at your partner who didn't seem to have that  restraint and he said uh people outside are out there licking pennies i'm like dude they're  retarded people and they can hear us and i know granted they're like goldfish they forget in eight  seconds but it was still very very embarrassing because it was broadcasting to the to the whole 
[00:15:30]  uh casino out there they could hear everything that was being said well we were working really  hard trying to get laughs and i'm like why don't we just uh hand out pinwheels at a little  the same thing yeah it was really uncomfortable because they could hear us it was like i don't  mind trashing somebody behind their back to me that's more satisfying yes of course and more  brave yeah but you can't make fun of retarded people when they can hear it but you know what  julie uh was a trooper she was great man yeah she was amazing she was able to keep us uh on the road 
[00:16:00]  i guess under control under control sure good and kenny where's kenny was on the air and he was just  where is kenny nuisance got to introduce club soda kenny to this crowd there's club soda kenny everyone  wow kenny get an applause break yes kenny's very popular very popular guy on the show so we asked  them you know we want to get the feel for the local station you know because we're up here that  it's one of the reasons we're here and uh julie uh decided to tell us that uh because it's called the  wolf now you know what we went through yesterday afternoon so julie i go julie does anyone how because

[00:54:00]  answers anonymously and then we read the answers on the air and try to figure out who it is and you  never have to stand up and admit that you were the dude that wrote down this particular answer you don't  have to but you'll be amazed at how perceptive we are what are the questions based on how you look we  can figure out usually kenny who did this yes sir go to danny what what questions are we asking the uh  crowd today i forgot already something to get a good one well we're doing too it's either uh you're 
[00:54:30]  the craziest thing that you've done sexually period or uh the one fantasy that you're too afraid to tell  your partner about ah okay either or kinky one yeah or violent it's kind of hard to approach uh your  significant other and say you know i like when you do this and it involves you know because you're  worried you're gonna get looking at me uh from the back of my head or i want to kill you and have  sex with your corpse that's even a harder all right so i'm bringing that up so danny's working 
[00:55:00]  the crowd as far as that goes i'm thinking of honey he's miserable not a bad day oh he was great last  time me and kenny are having a nice dinner lou comes for dessert and he's he's not even in the seat  before the c-bomb is dropping oh god i drove here with my wife and kids last night that's that's rare  right that you would yeah they never come with me anywhere so yeah it's always just me and you  sharing one room i got a sweet you know thing right yeah there's no way i pay any amount of money for a 
[00:55:30]  little distance what a selfless act too because you did this so you could be here on the radio right  today because if you were just showing up for the show you wouldn't have to do that but  right but and then also she wanted to come and you know uh bring the kids and all that stuff  and the kids are screaming in the back that's fine i don't care but my wife is doing all the cliche  you know there's traffic we shouldn't have gotten this way oh god because we knew because you knew 
[00:56:00]  there was traffic here yeah and so did i but i just decided i like traffic i like to sit in traffic  it's fun that's why i did this not because i have bad luck you stupid person  there's just so many fine alternate routes to 95 yeah to get here this one yeah it's pretty much  one way to get here from new york off yeah just to hear that whole thing 
[00:56:30]  what happened you tried this you took a side road or something like that  that oh yeah so then i go i got off uh the highway and it was a lot of traffic so then uh  i i we're hoping for the hills have eyes thing exactly that would have been awesome i pulled off  uh just so my daughter could go to the bathroom and then when i said maybe we'll stay on the side  road because it goes the same way and she doesn't say anything and then i after a while i go i think  this was a mistake and she goes yes it was a mistake of course it was yeah oh and it's so much better 
[00:57:00]  knowing that you made an error and now you got to find your way back but to hear it from your wife  you have to hear it in an icy tone yeah really helps you find your way right really yes it was  really helps the situation oh yeah oh do you guys have like a lot of fun intimate moments like of  silliness oh sure jimmy no that's what jimmy always ask me these questions like do you hold hands  and i was telling him it's like going up to some guy who's in hell and tapping him on the shoulder hey  do you get out much do you have any fun and he's standing there with a big shovel of 
[00:57:30]  hot crap going what are you why are you asking me these questions it's hell it's a hell  there's no hand-holding he tells me i don't get it because i'm not married and i think he's probably  right i don't claim to get it but i always think that when when there's things in the marriage because  i tend to be dominant sexually so i always think a spanking fixes everything like you grab the hair  you know you do what you have to do but i think if i was to spank my wife i would have a hard time  stopping 
[00:58:00]  and eventually murder murder suicide smack you with a toaster in the tub  no one can uh compare it if you haven't been married right you can't tell somebody what it's  like no years of being married uh even if you're with the same girl yeah and not married there's just  that thing of being married that gives them carte blanche yep to be a bitch to you yes uh well and 
[00:58:30]  with the kids i don't understand what i don't understand of people that are married without  kids that have problems because i would leave in five seconds see that was my mistake yes yeah i don't  know why you were unhappy it's just weird so long because if you don't have kids you're not married  you just you're dating and you had a big party you annoyed everybody nobody you know what it was  i was so kind of i was caught up in this new career of radio yeah like the at the beginning of  the marriage uh everything was fine and dandy i had a crappy job she had a crappy job we'd get home  from our crappy jobs and talk about our crappy jobs uh and then i get into radio and it's like oh 
[00:59:00]  i'm fixated on this radio career so she could have done you know anything i didn't care but then after  a while it was like wow attractive girls are throwing themselves at me i want to have sex with them  yeah sure uh and then the wife just doesn't like that let me a little advice if you're married and  hot girls want to have sex with you and you'd have sex with them the wife's going to be very pissed  yeah just beware of that if if any of you didn't know that but you were a trooper you got to tell the 
[00:59:30]  skinny dipping story no because it's a regret and i hate life when when i was married uh we mean  oh for doing a radio uh up in boston and we used to have to do these gigs every wednesday night and  i wasn't that much happier all right and and we're doing this gig and we uh we just showed that we're  just good guys no good yeah we're just stupid i didn't have a crystal ball to look into the future 
[01:00:00]  that would have shown that i would have been divorced at some point and that this moment i i could utilize  it let's we should tell louie the story it was uh a gig we used to do we used to have to do these  gigs every wednesday night we would go to cadillacs and host some kind of chris chris remembers uh  cadillacs we got a we got an olden i honestly i don't remember that you don't remember cadillacs no  you do remember the weeknight gigs though that you'd have to go out to it was just like a bar night  yeah bar night you know for the audience uh this is chris uh we worked with him at aaf back in the day 
[01:00:30]  yeah and he came by to say hi to us seeing him again man you don't remember cadillacs no i don't  yeah it was uh it was not a memorable place see we we always got the crap gigs that's why he doesn't  remember but we uh he was working on the morning show we were the douches in the afternoons that had  to do all the crap so we took the gigs you know and uh they would have these kalua girls yeah that  would show up and they dress in these skimpy little outfits sure and hand out kalua shots picture  budweiser girls but instead of saying budweiser it says kalua girl so they're they're all very hot 
[01:01:00]  yeah but uh uh they were a little on the young side i guess they had to be legal to sell this  stuff i would think so a little on the young side they're shoving uh shots down our our yeah our  throat and we had seen them now we're seeing them every wednesday so we got a kind of like a  relationship we got a relationship going yeah and we have to hang with them because they're sponsors of  the show and you know it's my job honey yeah yeah kalua's paying a lot of money for them to hang 
[01:01:30]  out with us so we can't blow them off so yeah you can't blow them off now i'm married at the time  opi's been in a pretty steady relationship over the time and uh one night as i'm uh making out with  this girl with braces uh at cadillac one of the kind of young kalua girl behind the  behind the banner behind the big banner the braces were on her legs  why do you have to take this you know what polio needed to 
[01:02:00]  she was just laying there getting a medicine drip and he started kissing her that was my  first indication that anthony might not be happy with his marriage there may be a problem because  i'm like where's anthony and i see like uh just feet behind this banner that are a little too close to uh  young feet and she was standing on his feet like like abe vagoda and the godfather yes i was dancing  with her you asked so uh uh then we were asked to go um skinny dipping yeah with the kalua girls 
[01:02:30]  at a local lake by the kalua girls at a lake yeah they asked us it's very formal the way you said hey  let's let's go uh a request came in it was it was to be anthony and myself and uh about six or eight  really hot young girls oh geez and we considered it we had a little meeting yeah uh and and we had  been drinking sure you know and it seemed like a very good idea and then we thought no you know  something we can't do this i'm i'm married oh my god uh you know you got a girl 
[01:03:00]  and now all i uh it's like the end of dumb and dumber you guys are like the idiots we just  ruined the big bus full of girls came and now i have this to us saying i'm sorry i did that yeah  i'm embarrassed that i did that and i uh i've made an ass of myself and i don't know why the crowd  isn't pointing and laughing at us we just gave it doesn't matter it happened 10 years ago you could

[01:11:00]  break i don't know why i don't know why i just said that now everyone just turned over to the fan to  see if i'm just going to be on that why yeah that's real smart way to go thanks ass dummy all right  and he bought some of my coffee down at the uh imus ranch uh coffee i make this in my toilet do you 
[01:11:30]  i was brewing my own batch this morning so everyone is uh making their way back to their  seats i guess they found us kind of interesting because as soon as we went to break they all ran  to go to the bathroom oh that's good and then they answered questions so we're waiting for them to get  back in their seats so we could uh humiliate them in in front of everybody you don't say that directly  oh i'm sorry yeah you say that during the break when the mics are off we get oh wow what a stack of  papers danny we got some good answers danny or what what oh danny gets thumbs down thumbs down do people 
[01:12:00]  pull punches oh debbie's back everybody hey there she is anyone think of any more hair jokes uh during the  breaker who's that tennis player with the big headbands and the you know i forget oh uh  hopefully she'll wind up like venus charlatus oh  billy jean king i did that one i did that one very much sorry all right arthur ash 
[01:12:30]  why are you laughing at the arthur ash why because he's not around anymore well just  not around he's dead she doesn't have eight not around makes it sound like he's out of town  you actually took a trip he did all right it's a slow news day by the way i'm looking at our news  and uh update it too this is really a creepy yeah that's kind of like really eerie  kind of uh adds a little element of uh ooh mystery into this whole thing apparently 
[01:13:00]  i love the gossip apparently uh on wikipedia there was a posting uh about 13 hours before  the police were informed that uh benoit's wife and uh kid were dead uh that said that his wife is dead  and it was on wikipedia before the cops were ever informed or anything and they checked the ip and  it came from stanford uh connecticut which is where wwe is based what's that and he was there 
[01:13:30]  that's like their headquarters what's that what's that that's like wwf only they changed the name  because the world wildlife federation was going crazy about it they didn't want the idea that little  panda bears were wrestling and choke holding each other although i would pay to see that sure  cute little animals just beating each other bloody yeah but it was on the web report uh 13 hours  before police found the bodies yeah who somebody that was involved in the murder just was like we  gotta oh we gotta update this wikipedia yeah they're like really quick yeah on like i don't know 
[01:14:00]  should we wait nah because what if somebody looks them up and you know we want them 10 seconds  after the murder the wife is dead before the cops even do you don't call the police you don't  tell anyone you post it on wikipedia yeah wikipedia gotta get the facts straight  before you call the police well everybody wants to be the person that updates the wikipedia so yeah  well they took it down they took it down confirmation they're like you can't just  put that the guy's wife is dead without confirmation but now there is yeah now they're trying to figure 
[01:14:30]  out who at the office there uh you know posted that apparently he was texting people um telling  them where the dogs are the attack dogs the attack dogs and that his address opened and his address  so he uh i guess he kind of knew he was doing this i can't get over the fact he wrapped the  cord around his neck and put about 250 pounds of weight on his weight machine and then let it go  you know that's that's the part that really disturbs me the whole thing is sick but the fact that he uh  let 240 or 250 pounds go on his neck yeah that is what do you think he was the pull down yeah we 
[01:15:00]  figured it had to be the pull down use the pull down and let go and then what you tie a rope around it  and then you just let go of it well you just pull do the pull down and and you know the cable yeah  wrap your neck around that cable and then let go what cable you mean how he hung himself yeah yeah  he used he used the weight machine oh yeah so he put like 240 pounds on i'm saying i think he pulled 
[01:15:30]  it down and kind of attached something to it wrapped it and then let the weight and then just let it go  well he probably had it attached first he probably had it attached first uh and then like partially  around his neck or whatever and then lowered it down and then just moved his arms and let it snap  i wonder if he was being a you know a jockey ego guy about it like yo i could do sick 240  there you go let me put the pin down even yeah put it down for it i could do 240 that's nothing  he wanted to choke myself with that  somebody comes up mind if i working with you 
[01:16:00]  he wanted the investigators to go wow at 240. i'm not some pussy you're trying to lift that  you know so uh people are talking about that they're also talking lindsey lohan's on the  front page of all the papers today they found cocaine in her system oh a little coke leave  the girl alone from her crash that she did in uh what memorial day weekend can't she just be a young  lady and do coke and have sex right girls drink thumbs up yeah see yeah look at them right there  yeah all right they understand the lindsey lohan thing yeah absolutely i told you not to talk 
[01:16:30]  bitch all i'm picturing i'm sorry sir you are an intimidating man sitting there hey you sure  is wow sir what's the does the gentleman does he work for the club himself he's obviously security  you gotta have security whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i'm the general manager oh all right security  what now why didn't you just say he's the cleanup guy you're racist well he's a big guy look at  jimmy's stereotyping oh what he can't uh be the head of the he certainly can be yeah it's 2007 
[01:17:00]  mr uh 1950 but i noticed that the head guys started opening clubs in 2005 hold on now  where you go imus i noticed that the  i notice that the head guy is rather large they don't have like a five foot six guy who weighs 120.  no you noticed that yeah try to get out of trouble i'm sorry he owns the club  i'm embarrassed but i did owns the club a five foot six guy owns the club yeah how tall are you

[01:18:00]  with them for that reason they always have a girl and again i'm not dealing with girls like you know  i'm talking about craigslist at three in the morning they always have a driver quote unquote yeah  but there's always somebody in case things get out of hand they always have a guy with them  well yeah just in case things get out of hand but i'm here for o b and anthony  all right no b and anthony i wouldn't be here at six in the morning actually he's here to hit us  sent them they normally don't send a big guy for administrative purposes  no kidding well thanks for coming absolutely thanks for bringing the lovely uh ladies we'll see them

[01:19:00]  at a nice club like in some of the other clubs where you had to like fold your arms and go could you  you eject this song bobby jack please it's the most awkward moment for a stripper when they're  dancing and they don't like the song and then they got to hold up like their panties in front of  their chest and go eject this please what's what's your new song starts what's your song of choice  it doesn't really matter i don't dance anything yeah but every stripper has their favorite song 
[01:19:30]  and do you mind being called a stripper no i don't mind it at all  because i'm like those take off philologists or yeah yeah something mark well back in new york we  call we call girls strippers and they're like take it all i'm an exotic dancer oh yeah exotic  i'm an adult entertainer shut up so you you don't have a go-to song no not really yeah you'll you like  uh uh like 80s hair band songs not really to dance to no ring around the rosie like you're stripping

[01:20:30]  they're gonna be on that stage tomorrow night when we do our comedy show  uh what else larry king triples ratings with the paris interview that no one uh seemed to care about  but it looked like a lot of people did care about it sure exactly just when you think uh because you  hear in the news people don't care anymore they don't want to hear it everybody that says they  don't care uh but then larry king puts them on and he gets these ratings like he hasn't seen in  years nothing else on what else is there to watch what time is it on you're right whenever there's  nothing did you see larry asking about the strip search we did a whole thing on yesterday he wouldn't 
[01:21:00]  let up it's like why how come when he gets like ted kennedy up there he doesn't just bash him about  chappaquiddick like he did about the body cavity search with paris hilton he wouldn't stop what was  it like was it gross he actually said was it gross like everyone thinks it would be i'm like yeah who would  think that's gross except uh you larry that was everyone was just picturing it as the hottest thing  ever is her going in there and going all right take it off we need to i want her like hose down 
[01:21:30]  like taylor if i may use the planet of the apes again it's a mad hose a mad hose  hosing her down and then the full body cavity search she had to uh enjoy that without the night  cam uh camcorder yep green eyes well the man said clean them up she sat down and left a lee press-on  nail on the chair nothing on that one all right we got a little something something 
[01:22:00]  that's sunk did you ever get strip searched in a jail oh you've been to jail i've never been to  jail knock what well he's from mexico originally that's just part of the culture down there i guess  in occasionally just part of part of the cavity search a rite of passage  be mewling something no i got i got in upstate new york once i got strip searched i was driving  with no license and i got pulled over for speeding so right there on the shoulder of the road what 
[01:22:30]  i had to point and laugh oh you saw the finger at point and laugh and got all scared that's right  uh no i had the guy made me stand there they don't touch you but first they make you bend over and  spread your cheeks yeah and then he says space front and then he says lift just the word lift he wanted  me to lift my testicles really yeah because i guess folks tuck all kinds of dangerous things  beneath their scrotum yeah what the hell can you fit under tic tacs some guy's trying to bring a  tic tac into the joint depending on how cold it is a couple of double a batteries yeah new onion flavored 
[01:23:00]  tic tacs yeah that's good but i had a weird moment where i thought that he wanted because he's just  saying lift your testicles did he want me to use my hands to do it or do it with the natural muscles  yeah like you can do that which they are magic ladies they move all by themselves yep absolutely  what's in there makes us talk to you the need to rid that 
[01:23:30]  so uh larry did well with that spice girls uh reuniting god is it a slow news day no that's  huge actually why is that huge i don't know i didn't know what else to say oh all right  but uh you had a good comment uh no it wasn't a good comment the ugliest one is now the hottest  yeah yeah it's apparently sporty spice the uh the dyke spice well it is now like the hotter of the  spice girls now i don't want any reaction so please don't whoop and cheer like i knew you were going  to oh my god oh my dear sweet jeez hold up please hold it feels like the season finale of six feet 
[01:24:00]  under in here they're tired i know it's a little early i was like i was like azy spice huh i like  azy spice she was the one who would just like be in the back and cry while they all dance and sang  she keeps on giving and giving and giving and giving all right so what what's the bad information we  have from these people we don't have any yeah we're gonna do that after the break no well danny's not 
[01:24:30]  too happy with the answers we got from this crowd i hope it's just danny being uh an idiot yeah you  never know and also the iphone is released today did you get your iphone oh it's 6 6 p.m oh louie  loves this stuff too and yeah you have to buy all this crap and you don't even know what what it  does no you just have to have it yeah but i don't know where to get did louis said the best thing and  i keep thinking of this he said he goes i don't even kicks people going like there's a phone man the  phone doesn't sound as good he said i don't even care about the phone this is the most kick-ass ipod 
[01:25:00]  yeah it's a great ipod it's just a great ipod yeah the way you could just whoop scroll through stuff  yeah i love it i don't know where i can get one yeah i didn't order i want to walk into a place  the overprivileged guy that i am yeah and walk in and just get one yeah no and then to um to get the  service you don't have to go through some guy going go what did they do to get the service  did we talk to contract you go home plug it into your uh your mac and do it all online really yeah 
[01:25:30]  you get the service from uh really all online using the number you have you know what the problem  just for a second about those folks the yes what do they call it outsourcing yeah yeah i don't have a  you know obviously any problem with anybody from another country giving me my service i think the  reason it's bad for the service is that they live in an insanely different world yeah which means they  just don't have any sympathy for you they just don't care they live in a place where there's  bugs in the water and nobody has food so when you go i don't have service there's something in the 
[01:26:00]  guy's voice like i don't care about you you live in a country full of pigs like they just you can  just hear it he's sending money back to his family so they don't have to live in a sewage pond  yeah when you're complaining i don't get the tv feature on my phone exactly yeah yeah that's a  great point because when you call like american airlines and you get the lady from texas she's  like oh you all got sick i'm sorry to hear that yeah but the guy in india is just like you know what

[01:30:30]  find one yeah there you go dan we were uh we were asking the crowd uh one of two things either speak  up either what they're uh they're uh the most the weirdest thing that they've done sexually was or the  one fantasy that they were too afraid uh to ask of their partner or you put it here on the radio  well that's anonymous oh that's right yeah so they don't even have to stand up which is uh good  but we will try to guess like their spouses won't guess i want to have sex with my aunt katherine 
[01:31:00]  in the shed that i built last year oh no too many details do we have the answers yeah they're all in  this uh the hat this gold club hat the hat oh gold club nice plug all right here jimmy why don't you  pull one out or anthony there jim you have the honors oh first one there we go all right this is  sexual fantasy yeah you'll know by the answer i'm sure that's very sure my fantasy is to snuggle with 
[01:31:30]  jim norton uh and you were the one that read it wow yuck uh is that girls i think it's the general  manager of the strip club let me see um right pick someone who looks like they want to lose weight  rapidly let me see that let's see the writing uh yeah that's a guy's writing it's a guy's writing  and he thinks he's being sarcastic by saying snuggle well maybe maybe he wants a butt rub jimmy 
[01:32:00]  i can't do that we're at a casino because legally you're not allowed to at a casino yeah liar i have no  idea if that's correct or not i just think that's what fredo would have said i think i think you need  to do a butt rub in front of everybody with one lucky listener one lucky listener gets to butt rub  jimmy this morning oh that guy would do it in a second of course he went with his face  can he find out if it's legal i i don't know there shouldn't be any lewdness yeah that's good word 
[01:32:30]  good word officer could you just say nudity you had to make it official yeah thanks no no lewd and  lascivious behavior all right uh we have another answer to the question we asked the crowd  anthony's got one let's see and this guy wrote a book report yes lately i have been extremely turned  on by the thought of my wife being with another woman i don't even need to be there i just want to  hear about it later wow that's a good one that's kind of odd uh 
[01:33:00]  you you want your wife to be with another woman don't have to be there just hear about it later  lately yeah and i'd like to know where do you want to be while it's happening yeah what like will you  just say look my friend's coming over because you go grab me a paper and come back in five hours  does anyone want to admit to this one that's a pretty common fantasy you're thinking it's louis ck  i was thinking the same thing listen anything it gets me away from my wife for a couple of hours 
[01:33:30]  i wish my wife would do anything you know without me there you know it was louis that i want my wife  to be with the lakers and never come home that's kind of an odd thing though like doesn't want to be  there and just hear about it later yeah that's kind of a cuckold thing yeah a lot of guys like  to be cuckold where a woman will go out and have sex with other people and then come back and tell  him about it while they have sex sometimes with other guys in this case like no self-confidence that  he can pull off the uh the two-on-one like that it's it's you know because it's a very it's a very 
[01:34:00]  difficult thing to satisfy uh two people like that at once well who wants to admit to that anybody  you mean satisfy two people that's not because the truth of the matter is let's be honest you're  not satisfying two people you're satisfying the newer one that's there right uh much to the chagrin  of the older one who will later later file papers you're in another world from where i would be in  that situation really yes i just picture two women completely devoting themselves to making me very 
[01:34:30]  happy oh really care less if they're having a good time oh okay that is like how am i going to  satisfy those two women but you wouldn't care no let them do each one each side of my from him and  then uh yeah but there's only only one can really give you the ultimate in in pleasure yeah only one  can like be right there at the well the other one can be tickling your uh yeah exactly but but but the  one can do it also i mean there's gonna be something else that's gonna have to happen maybe where you 
[01:35:00]  won't be able to talk very well you know but that would be helping her out sure you could do things  like that i don't know there's always seems to be here's here's how i think threesomes go yeah what  do you mean think well yeah here's who are you kidding here's how i just can imagine them going  just imagine a way you are using 99 of your body to satisfy one woman yeah and your your right hand or 
[01:35:30]  your left hand is out like you're making a turn in a car uh trying to take care of somebody that  you could care less is in the room right yeah but that's and that and that's when you're sleep  right that's when you're in the end game there with the full-on doing that yeah yeah but all there's  so much you know two people both uh the build-up at the same yeah there's so much that leads up to  that yeah there is a lot of two hands that belong to two different individuals upon your yeah yeah 
[01:36:00]  yeah yeah of course but one of them is bob doll  the build-up is usually a lot of booze that's how it starts yeah sure booze booze booze can't  stress that enough yeah all right give louie the hat there let's uh get another right answer to one  of these questions good luck lou pick a good one things i do get a good one get a good one all right  oh it's just watch wife with a guy and me this is confusing watch watch wife with a guy 
[01:36:30]  and me he threw himself in as an afterthought oh yeah and me i have to be a part of this somehow he  wants to watch wife with a guy and himself that's very confusing he wants to watch he wants to watch a  video of himself with a guy and his wife he wants to watch his wife does he want to have sex with the  guy too did you want a guy to dominate them as a couple he's really weird dude like i want a little  little fireman helmet imprints on both of our faces that is something uh i have never and would 
[01:37:00]  never be party to is the guy guy girl oh yeah what do you it's like what the hell do you need that for  well no does does unless you're like playing cards in between no uh if you've got a man and a woman  you can add as many women as you want right 50 women in one guy there you go but if there's a guy  and another no i don't doesn't work another guy does a person that uh wrote that down want to admit 
[01:37:30]  this or what watch usually when we do this bit people are brave enough to stand up and uh  say all right i was the one who wrote that's right they'll proudly admit that's up watch wife with a  guy and me somebody out there with his girl and a guy no no he doesn't want to fest i wouldn't  either you're a homo i want wife to tie me up and instruct other gentlemen on how to punish me  that was mine and grab another one there ah moving on here we go 
[01:38:00]  yep my uh sexual dream would be to meet rod stewart oh that's got to be debbie obviously  yeah yeah what do you want to do give him his wig back that's that's got to be debbie who are you  kidding why are you nodding it is it is oh my gosh she even likes musicians with her hair it finally  explains the hair and you work at the ballpark right you were saying yes yeah yeah because matt

[01:40:30]  anyway thanks for taking your time out of your show wayne's world  coming over because uh finally finally got one our goal is to go all the way to nine with hair jokes  with debbie that's great we're still going strong she looks like a negative photo of florence henderson  oh your hair is all right do we have another one we got another answer this is a long one i know  people are writing book reports back when i was 22 in 1988 all right look around do the math uh won a 
[01:41:00]  bunch of money in reno and made a road trip to the mustang ranch uh the brothel picked up a girl for  full service half and half you know what that is jimmy i certainly do right f and s all right wait wait  wait what's half and half though um well just think of a couple of things you can do in half and half  yeah one where she can uh talk to you and one when she can't okay she's busy with her yeah got  something else yeah uh during the part of the session where the girl washes and checks you very 
[01:41:30]  well for diseases i guess that's one of the tricks way to keep it sexy she's doing that she looked up at  me and said you have uh two um orifices what you mean the back part no she's talking  about his when you're having manhood yeah where where the uh finale occurs yeah yeah occur two  different uh yeah it's like a sprinkler right it's like splitting your cable uh yeah exactly 
[01:42:00]  so you can ti-vo two programs at once except you're losing half the signal though  you don't use your cable to humiliate two people at once  well she said that he was in possession of two of those i was just kind of stunned and wondering  uh why she mentioned it so we finished up the full service deal out in the parking lot  after the session i asked my brother how many he had and he was like what what are you talking about 
[01:42:30]  uh what uh called him a dirty name uh i told him that i had two and he said yeah you suppose i've  one he had one so uh they've been calling him double barrel for the rest so it took it took  until a hooker in in reno to realize to find out to realize that he had uh one extra yeah uh outlet  like outlet yeah wow you would have thought nobody like a nurse in school or somebody would have gone 
[01:43:00]  excuse me you would have thought his mom would have said something like yeah i don't want to uh  clean off the wall every time you're in the bed the wall and the floor yeah right send him into the  world with a deranged general without telling him if you have a penis with two holes in it how does  your doctor not notice when you're born how does that not come up when you're born like this all  right who's kill this thing all right who's who's the freak of nature you want to admit this to  everybody today where's the guy with a double uh no double hey oh we got someone finally admitting 
[01:43:30]  something can you get a mic on him get a mic on the fellow with the two uh he went he went for the  e-rock water questions so sir so you're you're you're now we got to be careful on this one um  now now your penis has nostrils is that what it is  are they side to side like this or is it up down uh i've heard all the questions um sure they're up and  down they're up and down up and down uh only one low line of the day serviceable wow uh the other 
[01:44:00]  one is just uh dead oh okay oh all right okay i hate that it's like when they close off one tube  in the midtown tunnel they did twice as long to get through what happened she was checking in she  saw little orange cones and asked what was going on she said she just looked up you know well you're  aware of the cleaning portion she just looked up and they look extra hard i've been through you know  plenty of football and physicals and the old wow nobody ever mentioned mother never mentioned  i was going to ask so you thought it was normal until uh she made a weird uh until she said it was

[02:01:30]  jonathan you're looking good all right stop stop it are they hearing it on the radio can you guys hear  it did you absolutely think this would work no it might have worked i don't know i just didn't have  it in my headphones i have it in your ipod we can put the headphones around a mic let's try it again  i just wanted to hear the clip i didn't hear it in the headphones back here live at the waterfront  village with my friend the zombie jonathan you're looking good jonathan just got an awesome face paint

[02:02:30]  jonathan just got an awesome face paint job what do you think i like turtles all right you're great  zombie and good times here at the waterfront village open for the next 11 days i think  something's wrong with young jonathan well he's that's what he wanted to tell the world yeah he  likes turtles i like turtles louie you missed the guy that could kick himself in the head from the  audience he didn't even take his glasses off no it's really cool watching tim robbins kick himself  like that all right and now we got the uh the transgendered seven-year-old from paul is on 
[02:03:00]  paul is always trying to be a little uh sensational yeah she's an ass and this one i mean what's  going on with the parents i want to hear this story at 18 months george was interested in dolls and  pink things 18 months 18 months oh what it's normal he likes pretty colors pink is lovely and he's a  park let's uh let's uh let's listen to this so we bring home this sixth little boy whom we thought 
[02:03:30]  was going to be just like the others and it became readily apparent very early on that she was not  anything like them john and shannon watched in disbelief as their 18-month-old little boy  was drawn to all things pink pretty and feminine well as a boy she would never play with any 
[02:04:00]  stereotypical boy toys no cars no trucks no cars no legal box none of that she had no interest in  those things she wanted barbie and rat stalls and cinderella and princesses all the pretty things she  wanted i offered to buy her any toy as long as it was a boy toy i'd buy her any toy and it did not  work i tried to buy her trucks and stuff and she even though we bought them she wouldn't want they  would my other boys would just play with them she wouldn't this uh they're calling her a she i don't 
[02:04:30]  know how old is this kid uh this was at 18 months low seven now why what do they want from their kid to  play with trucks because 18 month old is still crapping in a diaper they don't know anything  they don't care who cares if he's playing with something they had other boys in the family and  they they saw something a little different in george that's good parenting i like that  see here's here's a truck i don't like it all right you're shade yeah exactly 
[02:05:00]  all right let's get the operation georgette give you a little she has like what a two  uh less than a two-year window to prove his manhood otherwise he'd start calling her by a  girl's name but love and then go on tv and tell the world you know people should kill themselves  leave their point leave their kids in an orphanage and be better treated he doesn't even know what  all what all his body parts do with that they're just stupid blobs of uh flesh they don't have a 
[02:05:30]  personality like the color pink yeah what's wrong with that we say as adults that it's masculine and  feminine kids don't look at masculinity or femininity that's not lovely hey you want this brett farve  jersey no get the scalpel all right we'll cut it off cut it off it's not working right you won't be  using this in all fairness the next clip uh they thought it was a phase mom talks about first time  she dressed him as a girl why did it doesn't matter they're little kids this this gets way better so 
[02:06:00]  they thought it was a phase like you guys are kind of just the fact that they're on paul is on  talking about their kids sexuality means they need to die fast and and painful why do you have to  tell the world yeah all right this is now turned into an oprah or jerry springer audience right  they're applauding you they're a very nice audience yeah extremely nice sweet all right uh let's uh  listen to this clip at first they thought it was just a phase maybe it would pass the family struggled to 
[02:06:30]  make sense of what was happening they tried to embrace at first they thought at first our producers  thought it was just a phase and we put it wouldn't put them on the show so then they said what if i  start dressing him like a girl and calling him she then maybe we'll let you on yeah then maybe we'll  book springer yeah this sounds like one of those things that you know the uh the parents that or the  parent that gets their kids sick yes attention yes munchhausen munchhausen it's called paul is on  syndrome yeah paul is on syndrome yeah it's the parents making it about them like oh we had to 
[02:07:00]  do this obviously it's a little a girl trapped in a little boy's body yep go ahead sorry go ahead  at first they thought it was just a phase maybe it would pass the family struggled to make sense of  what was happening they try to embrace their son's differences in the privacy of their home they let  george play with dolls shannon described what it was like the first time she let her four-year-old son 
[02:07:30]  dress up as a girl the pink gown was a little odd it was a little took a little getting used to  but when i saw the sheer joy on her face and just how she came out of her shell it was very easy to look  past oh my god the pink nightgown but her husband's job was in shock i thought oh my god what is what  is going on here what what is he doing dressing up as a girl is it is is it halloween is it a joke 
[02:08:00]  what parents this is the last straw my son was playing with dolls and now he's dressing up as a girl  this father is nothing like my dad let me tell you that nothing like my oh my god what's she doing  he's dressing up like a girl my father i told that story i had made a puppet i made a puppet but i  hadn't put the strings on it yet because i was a stupid kid i was like i don't even know maybe seven 
[02:08:30]  years old six years old and i made a puppet out of paper towels and tape and it was it was a doll  it was like this you know a little thing and i was going to put strings on it i had this little thing  i was going to make a marionette yeah exactly and my father went what the is that and and i went  daddy it's a puppet he goes it's a doll you're not playing with a doll and he takes it away from  me and my mother was like joey it's a puppet he's making a puppet leave him alone he's just being  himself and i'm like because i cried at the drop of a hat anything between my parents 
[02:09:00]  joey wants a doll he wants a doll and and and i i i wanted to take the puppet to the store because  we were all going to the store together and i took it with me and my father would not let me go into  the store with a a goddamn doll yeah i'm not taking uh my son in with a doll it's a puppet joey your ass 
[02:09:30]  row it's a doll he's like you want to raise a fag son and this is what he was saying yeah wow and  and and you know lo and behold they did little did he know if he had died so soon i'd have showed him  hey dad look at this photo let me play with my puppet i'm brando and that's the guy who did underdog  this is a puppet of a fireman and i'm giving him mouth to mouth  hey uh george tried to cut off his own uh junk with a scissor there george and george is only 
[02:10:00]  about seven maybe george has been shamed by his he should be taken away the fact that he was playing  that he he's playing with a doll and they wouldn't leave in the house with it like your dad yeah yeah  and that they're amazed that he likes pink things at 18 months mm-hmm and paul is on should also be  shot you're not doing a real for not criticizing or attacking these people she's just she's just  using them as a freak factor and she called herself a journalist what a pig oh she can criticize and 
[02:10:30]  attack does she we've seen oh yeah she went after this show she went after us but parents were driving  their children to lop their penises off all right well yeah let this let them slide uh let's uh get the  audio in because we're running out of time here they started seeing changes in their son's moods  shannon says george was depressed angry and even attempted to cut off his penis with scissors she  didn't want to go to school she would cry every day please don't make me go it's too hard to be a  boy she would tell me mommy i'm not a boy i'm a girl and when you heard that the first time what did 
[02:11:00]  you think in my heart of hearts i knew that she was telling me the truth she is physically a boy  but mentally and emotionally there is nothing male about her it's a gay kid yeah gay people  relate more to women it doesn't matter she's a kid well it's only seven years old it doesn't matter  yet yeah let's uh why are we saying it i haven't seen him i know i have a nephew who you have to call  him repairman that's his name for two years now his name is repairman he won't answer to anything else 
[02:11:30]  and you just go with it what is he he doesn't have a job you just go with it until it's not  like he's working for the he's not like he's a senator that has to be held up to some scrutiny  we're not going to call you senator repairman listen we're running out of five years old too  bad you don't call him cable guy he can make a lot of money you know larry stop me hey uh okay  running out of show and we get to hear the voice of george uh but first parents decide uh let george 
[02:12:00]  live as a girl and then we'll uh hear from george go i had basically lost my son and it was just  like someone came into your house and took your kid away and kidnapped him and they were gone to help  the transition they decided to transfer their son to a different first grade where no one knew him  on december 19th 2006 george became ashley that's a pseudonym too a new name came with a new look  ashley showed up in her new school with long hair painted fingernails and frilly dresses just like 
[02:12:30]  the little girl she says she always dreamed of being ashley has decided to keep her past a secret  from her new friends until she was on the paul is on show she was on cnn yeah until the first  locker room experience yeah actually how do you hide that actually it's still a secret because she  gets no ratings for that show yeah nobody's watching she's out soon uh well there you go she's seven  years old now dressing like a girl and now we finally get to meet uh ashley hi daddy who used to 
[02:13:00]  be george here i'm seven here we go and agreed to talk with us only if we didn't show her face  so how did it make you feel when you wore boys clothes really really sad i just wanted to um take all my  clothes throw them in the garbage and i would go to um tell my mom that i want more girl clothes  what was making you feel sad sounds like a boy or because i couldn't be who i wanted to be 
[02:13:30]  how hard is it for you to be dressed like a girl to feel like a girl and have to hide the fact  that you were physically born a boy well it is hard to hide that secret shannon and john say doctors  have told them that ashley is transgender born genetically a boy but showing persistent interest  and behavior typical of a girl they know they'll face difficult decisions as ashley reaches puberty but 
[02:14:00]  for now they say they'll do whatever it takes to make their child happy  wow all that would make that kid happy is late i think paul is on needs to be lit on fire  and then people need to laugh while she burns but she has a problem with our comedy show  how was it when you went through that struggle which one are you talking to debbie  debbie another joke say at your expense uh all right uh hey hey no no seriously uh nikki six 
[02:14:30]  yeah we got to wrap up this side of the show unfortunately do we have time to do this quick  30 second clip all right ashley tells really ashley tells of a dream she had really fast let's go  your mom told me when you were younger you wished you could be a little girl yeah do you remember  dreaming that yeah what did you see in that dream um me being a girl having a happy time 
[02:15:00]  with all my dolls with all my boy toys out and all the girl things in that's my happy dream finally  ashley's dream has come true has it this kid sucks paula it's all about paul is on she's finally  is this a happy uplifting story because the way paul is on who's talking is like oh finally way to  go paul ashley's dream has come true they didn't give her an operation though you gotta tell me they 
[02:15:30]  didn't not yet way to go paul because i don't think that would grow all right start up that  like it would develop it would be this tiny little seven year old oh god unfortunately we had to rush  through that segment because there's so much to that we'll continue on the other side i guess right  on xm now uh we're gonna actually just broadcast and we'll talk more about that with cursing yeah  uh kenny the big plugs you got a mic still yeah the gold club's got two locations and don't get

[02:18:00]  first uh the first show we do two shows every day this is the call-in portion of uh the opian anthony  show yeah it's the one we really don't care about we don't give as much effort at least what the  message boards say yeah and they're right let's be honest so the phone in portion so jimmy goes  backstage and then just goes ballistic what i like what i like to do is we get something called the  dump report which lets us know what al back at cbs dumped out of on regular radio and there's 
[02:18:30]  certain things that you can't say about ejaculating there's just certain words that will get you in  trouble so he dumps it he dumped the line i did about when i said when you when the guy who was  sitting there said he had an orgy with 12 people and i said who is it christ like at the last  supper he dumped that line the and he goes up and and and and this was his reason why he goes i  dumped a lot of the christ line because i just didn't think what what do you have the email no it  says uh it just didn't feel right just i want to see exactly what he what did he say it just didn't 
[02:19:00]  feel right put on fans mike or why don't you just use my thing hey uh he's got it ah there it is all  right um norton during discussion of uh fantasy involved an orgy with a man his wife and 12 others  this didn't sound this just didn't sound good in orgy and christ in the same reference  and that got done and and and these these these heresy heresy holy now we gotta now we gotta go  burn a witch but you understand what we're up against in commercial radio it's like they it's 
[02:19:30]  like how do you expect people to succeed when you dump something like that it's not a curse it's not  an fcc violation no it's just a funny line about christ dumping a load what's wrong with that  god god almighty if you're not gonna be able to come what's the use of being the messiah  what a bunch of corporate faggots  they're all just beaten down to this point everyone's beaten down afraid to say anything 
[02:20:00]  oh afraid of what little group is going to come chasing after them what the hell though the people for uh  uh orgies are going to come out against uh you put us in the same light as jesus we're angry please  excuse me thank you i like that one that was a good line it was a good line i didn't like it  they're just falling asleep out there oh no point and laugh friday in effect oh boy oh boy it's also  f you friday mispronunciation friday uh air guitar friday friday no one does air guitar though no

[02:51:30]  who described himself as carol burns boyfriend arrived at sydney's glebe morgue are we supposed to  know who that is by the way carolyn burns yeah well yes carolyn burns all right go ahead just hours  after uh her body had arrived there his request stunned the attendant i quote do you mind if i look  at her breasts yes he used the t-word the attendant kenneth nichols who described the encounter in his 
[02:52:00]  police statement later told police he had worked uh out that uh the man was gordon wood  you said wood wood i've never had anyone ask me something as strange as this in my 15 years  in the funeral industry he's worked in all the facets of the funeral people love to think they're  just another business yeah they talk about it like you know well we got to order more of this chemical 
[02:52:30]  that we pump into people's dead veins like they want to think they're like k-mart or some other  just yeah i work at target or something no you're a gruesome ghoul yes you work in an industry that is  uh like it's made horror movies yeah you're helping people do something that they probably shouldn't be  doing right and they can't wait to go burning people they can't wait to go to conventions painting  their yeah there's conventions where they have new thing oh this so this new thing fits into the 
[02:53:00]  the femoral artery oh so i could pump more of this uh so this will drain the blood out of the body  faster you're interesting you know this uh the tray they lay in yeah i used to have spillage and you  have to mop the floor now no spillage that's right and they're demonstrating they can't wait to book  their flights to the next convention these are great wooden feet to replace the ones that are yeah  swollen bizarre and upsetting balloon size and i'm sure they're all like you'd be surprised no the  conventions are a lot of fun oh they're a ball some of the most fun people i've ever met are 
[02:53:30]  funeral directors sure are they yeah well anyone's fun compared to a corpse yeah the people they deal  with like you're considered fun in that world if someone says hello and you go high back the only  people that that they deal with are dead people and grieving people yeah the only people having less  fun are wearing braces and uh being the gm of a new york radio station  come on it's a tom joke that was no they laughed though jimmy they laughed everyone knows tom wears 
[02:54:00]  braces  but you want to hit something no i do not absolutely not all right continue with the uh  burns body was found on june 8th 1995 jesus at the base of cliffs at the gap  uh watson bay in sydney uh who knows what this must be a big case in australia yeah because they  said that when the man described himself as carolyn burns they they probably do know who she is  carolyn burns crikey prosecutors allege mr wood then uh driver and assistant to the late stockbroker 
[02:54:30]  renee rivkin they give everyone's name uh threw burn over the cliff because she might have exposed lies  he had told about the business dealings with rivkin so it was kind of a little triangle thing going  on and he actually heaved her off the cliff and killed her and then went to the funeral home  to see what her boobs and wanted to see her breasts yeah sorry why because he's a perv they don't give 
[02:55:00]  oh it's perv news he's just curious what that would do yeah what happens to breasts when you throw them  off a cliff i gotta know i gotta know i just have to i'm probably gonna go to prison could i just see  those all right uh jimmy you want to pick out the next i wonder if anybody ever got breast implants  uh you know as part of being buried because they're mixing you up anyway just like you're dead  yeah could you give me implants just for the funeral you know anything you can imagine has probably 
[02:55:30]  happened sure it has so there probably has been somebody that said in their will look before i get  buried i want implants put in and i want them to walk up to the casket and just see giant breasts  and go wow she looks great you should have one put in if you're getting buried have like have like  your little a cup and then a double d and then make your make your like family grieve and like  wonder what the hell's the matter with you at the same time i like this one elderly man uses bagel  as bait and sexual assault i didn't read this in advance so i don't know what it is it's in upper darby 
[02:56:00]  pennsylvania ah i thought that was connecticut so i got excited and i'm like no stupid  an elderly man was accused of luring a mentally retarded woman by buying her a bagel and then  sexually assaulting her cheap date that should be the title of a sitcom that whole sentence  the old man the bagel the duh what would you like on that some dirt all right this ball on nbc an  elderly man lures a mentally retarded women with a bagel and sexually assaults her and sexually 
[02:56:30]  but she felt really guilty about it but i love that he's elderly too  he's 76 76 it's great that he's an old man and he's probably too broke to afford good things  so he's like all right she looks stupid hey you want some uh bread that's been cooked into a circle  you want the bagel dummy you want the bagel well his name is joseph bellino he'd apparently been 
[02:57:00]  watching the young woman as she took the same walk every day which was probably in a circle in a yard  somewhere believe me it wasn't to the library or yale see i don't know any universities in upper darby  there's a big step what the library or yale yeah yeah it could have been somebody else  like it yeah all right all right all right i don't know about the sounds today i don't know  where any colleges are in upper darby you are never to blame you're yelling about colleges you're not 
[02:57:30]  all right the woman uh he brought the woman home and then sexually assaulted her uh wait wait  you're skipping over a huge part oh i'm sorry on thursday on thursday on thursday  on thursday he talked to her figured out she wanted a bagel what but that took eight hours  she probably wanted a beagle and she just didn't know how to say it so she wanted a dog and now she's  being assaulted for a sesame bagel speaking of retards and sesame bagels where is kenny 
[02:58:00]  i'm over here i thought you were where what part of the wolf den are you in  that's the noise the girl made when she realized she wasn't getting her dog  on thursday he talked to her figure that she what did you say drove her to dunkin donuts and told  her yeah i'm getting right okay drove her to dunkin donuts and told her she could eat at his house  he brought the woman home and then assaulted her he told her to keep the encounter a secret and of 
[02:58:30]  course she told the relative because you know big mouth blabbermouth yeah snitch uh he was charged  with assault and um related counts he's charged illegal possession of a firearm um and i think it  was she actually wanted a donut but he just told her that the bagel was a donut and she didn't know  any better and so he's assaulted her sexually yeah no i forgot we were on the wolf i had a bavarian cream  joke coming up right at yourself kids what um he said the woman has the mental capacity of a small 
[02:59:00]  child uh though he didn't know the exact nature of her condition besides that you can lure her to your  house with a bagel with a bagel should have known yeah by the way kevin from connecticut who usually  is a star in instant feedback he's here live so he handed in his instant feedback oh wow and uh he wrote uh  she said i like turtles hey he's a star even on a napkin there you go he's hitting a napkin as we

[03:00:30]  unattractive no no they're saying that they took away 18 of the counts so they could only prove  probably that he won because he abused one baby because the baby was actually the other one i think  he stole 19 babies abused one and then said this is a bad idea even for me i don't want to do this  i'm keeping them in my garage but i ain't uh i'm gonna stop there  uh geez the remains came from a woman treated at mckee i don't know what this

[03:12:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh wait wait we need danny's mic to work  uh danny's mic to work oh is that awful as amusing as that is the reason why the audio quality  is so poor is because it was actually going over the uh the internet in game 
[03:12:30]  right yeah all of his  that's supposed to be him like making trash talking with other players i guess he didn't  realize that his mic was open and he was uh  tweeting to his mother as all of his you know he should have been drowning in a tub before that  happened you're able to communicate with the rest of your team or the rest of the people  you're online with yes through this headset and he had it on as he's crying to his mother  that he wants to play the game so all of his buddies uh one of them taped it he was  listening and then uh recorded you know what though i recognize that cry though because  when you have tits this is what that because he's looking at the game and he's playing it 
[03:13:00]  yeah he's just throwing over his shoulder  it's this fake detached crying my daughter's five and she does that like she's going screaming and  wailing horror and i come in the room and she's like reading a book she's reading a book  with this totally placid look on her face they're all bsers dude that kid is a well she's got a  recording of crying playing yeah exactly she's like ferris bueller she's got it on the sampler 
[03:13:30]  yeah yeah someone's suggesting that she sounds like uh like a little denaro mom  please  stop calling me  mom i'm not gonna lord i have to do this now i have to do this  you want the tears to come out of my eyes we have more audio of this all right now the dad gets involved  uh-oh 
[03:14:00]  do you understand what just come out of that is nothing bad  there's nothing a few of them infiltrating the family is what you're reacting to it  upstairs now please 
[03:14:30]  here i'm going to disconnect  don't you get it at all  because all you're doing is damaging yourself  this is why you have to put limits on this game  you stay down here for hours  but tomorrow you have to get up at 6 a.m 
[03:15:00]  i can't know when the last time you ever got anywhere close to 6 a.m when i woke up for skiing  we woke up at like 5 30 then we've we've got to get back to skiing  no last year  okay that was a long time ago jake 
[03:15:30]  all right so the dad's getting involved and uh  but the dad's being a little too  that sounds like the mom that dad should take that back of his hand  and whack  unplug the machine  yeah just say just unplug and go game over huh  what happened to parents what happened to parents my father would have  just smack me yeah throwing the computer out the window  you don't buy the thing for the kid in the first place  if you want stupid kids then you're buying video games  uh we got kevin from connecticut he does instant feedback but he's live  and he's been writing them on a napkin 
[03:16:00]  give this guy the mic oh there's a different guy another guy somebody else on instant napkin  instant napkin we're going to allow this guy to say uh  whatever he wants to say now what did that sound like to you  it sounded like chris ben was on friday  all right okay  all right uh inappropriate uh we'll see you guys tomorrow wow it's a comedy  show oh my god you know what jeez you know what that was a good line you  got to give it to him a little too soon i don't know those people who knows them 
[03:16:30]  all right uh just the fact that that'll be acceptable in a few months means that  anybody who's bothered now is stupid here's why i don't care what anyone says  about tragedy these days because it all is only time yeah that's why there is a ride and i've  said in the past that they blow up at child's parties it's a titanic yeah that is going down  and you slide down it thousands of dead thousands died in frigid icy waters 
[03:17:00]  nobody knows nobody cares they bounced off of the uh smokestacks and now it's a it's a it's a ride  and now your kid can bounce off the smokestacks on the way down the slide and bounce down yeah it's  the and believe me in in a hundred years who's to say there won't be a world trade center ride sure  it's a horrible tragedy but enough time goes by no one cares yes they actually have banned that  that bad discontinued that titanic thing stop it jimmy's lying jimmy's lying because his tongue's  sticking out why don't you go give me a line like no the safety's on now it is 
[03:17:30]  from lucky lou ladies and gentlemen now now it's on now that was actually a very funny scene i it  was my favorite hysterically funny it was well written it was my eyes that were like hello  funnier than the writing stupid ham i should have pineapple around me wherever i walk  i want to poke a clove in your ass hey uh not because you're a ham i just want to do it 
[03:18:00]  you want to hear the rest of this oh i don't know as long as we don't make fun of it it's kind of hard  to hear but i think you get the gist and the dad going now we gotta be nice give him a time out  well the last clip the father grounds the kid good dad uh then attempts to take the pc oh this could be  a good dance how fat is this stupid kid what do you do you you're a father you you kick his ass yeah  you don't yeah punch him drown him i need you to finish this game i need you 
[03:18:30]  can i step in though for a second uh on his side believe me yeah the whiny idiot side  the parents don't understand the game no they shouldn't be they the game shouldn't exist in  the kid's life right right you can't get a game then give up he can't handle it you can't talk  them out of an addiction it's it's literally like giving them crack it is and then saying you got to  wrap up with the crack because you got to get up tomorrow but this isn't a game like i understand  what he's talking about because it's not a game that you can just get on and then you stop and save 
[03:19:00]  it and leave yeah some of these games it takes you four hours to get a group together so you can go for  eight hours on a raid yeah i mean you're talking about hours real time and it takes it takes time  to get the people together get them in a location you have to jimmy's disgusting jimmy's disgusting  but but it's i'm just trying to say there's a time thing where this kid might have spent hours already  just setting up to that's what you're doing with your kids when you give them a video game they're  pouring all of their effort and their brains into electronic nothing he's an idiot that has 
[03:19:30]  zero value it makes them numb and stupid and intolerable but that's why he's so upset family  should be just hand-eye coordination louis start the car close the garage door let him just die all  in their house like that every one of them but that's why the parents don't understand it's not  something you can just turn off it's a game where now you're in this situation where you can't just  turn it off you're you're involved in it and there's no save that's why he's so upset all right 
[03:20:00]  let's get back to the audio here it's very the computer game that you're now grounded from it  what what we've argued about this way too much today you've used this way too much  you should be smacked i'm sick of the game sick of anything else the whole family is spending the  entire day at your lacrosse match to us we are going out of it you let them get all the things  organized ready to get you to your matches tomorrow and you don't care
