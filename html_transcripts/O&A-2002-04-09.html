<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about NAMBLA, including an offensive song performed by one of the hosts.  This transitioned into a segment about a woman planning to breastfeed her nearly four-year-old son on air to win a trip to see Aerosmith.  Other contest entries included a jar containing a "pickled punk" (a dead fetus) and other shocking items.  Listener calls flooded in, expressing outrage at the breastfeeding plan.  The hosts also discussed the removal of their show from a station in Austin, Texas, by a manager named "Scooter," leading to the release of Scooter's email address and further angry listener calls.  The show also previewed upcoming segments featuring Sam Kinison's brother and the search for a new "Black Earl."  The breastfeeding mother and son then appeared in the studio, with the son breastfeeding on air, eliciting further shock and commentary from the hosts. Rich Voss, a guest, contributed frequent crude and insulting remarks throughout this segment.  The discussion of breastfeeding continued, interspersed with calls, including one from Bill Kinison about a Sam Kinison tribute on Playboy TV, and another from a caller, Katie, who performed a simulated orgasm on air.  The woman and child eventually left the studio.

The show continued with a discussion of a news story about a homeless man burned by youths, with Opie expressing approval of the act in response to a caller.  This led into the "F.U. Line," featuring profanity-laced listener messages.  Katie, the caller who performed the simulated orgasm, was brought back on air, leading to speculation about the breastfeeding mother's possible sexual activity during that segment.  The focus then shifted to the Aerosmith trip contest.  One contestant presented a jar containing a pickled fetus, triggering strong reactions.  Another contestant, a doctor, arrived with preserved cancerous organs (an esophagus and breast), further shocking the hosts and listeners. The doctor explained the medical aspects of the specimens. The hosts debated which contestant was more outrageous, ultimately leaning towards the "pickled punk" entry as a potential winner.  A new "Black Earl" was introduced, accompanied by a song.

Later in the broadcast, the hosts auditioned Len for the role of the new "Earl," looking for someone "cranky" and secretly angry.  They discussed airtime problems in Rochester, New York, speaking with a caller, Nate, from Clyde, New York, about broadcast delays.  A caller, Dave, claimed to be in London en route to Mount Everest to plant a "WOW" flag, a claim the hosts heavily doubted and mocked.  The show played Wesley Willis songs ("Kill Whitey" and "Chronic Schizophrenia"), announced the winner of the MTV trip to L.A. (the "Pickled Punk" entry), and discussed an upcoming celebrity softball game.  Listener calls continued, covering topics such as cancer and personal experiences with "pickled punks."  The show concluded with announcements about the return of their "WOW" campaign, an OzFest ticket giveaway, and mentions of other shows and events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I love you guys. I feel like I've known you forever.  This is so dumb.  Hi. Hi.  I don't know. I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Ha ha ha.  No! 
[00:00:30]  She's my hair, fuck boy.  Ha ha!  What are you?  Jay?  Ha!  What are you people?  On dope?  Have you seen nothing?  Do you know?  I can't see your appointment.  Ha ha ha!  Shut up!  I hate you, Clay.  We're going to get through this, Larry.  Just got to keep your shirt up. 
[00:01:00]  Hey!  Hey!  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony's show.  All right, yeah, yeah.  We've got to go right to Uncle John.  What's up, Uncle John?  Hey, guys, you're going to have to listen to that song again.  I think we should make Stephen Lynch's show psychic.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  He was on to something when he gave us that song about two and a half years ago, huh?  Yeah, like priests learned about molesting young boys two and a half years ago.  It was all allegedly...  Allegedly.  It wasn't even like chained to that song in, but now they're turning them over left and 
[00:01:30]  right.  Because finally now, I guess the Catholic Church realized it's time to do something about it.  Because they're kind of looking bad.  What they were doing, these priests would go off and fundle, fundle these young boys.  I know.  Calm down.  Calm down, Jimmy.  And they would just get relocated if there was a problem.  If someone came, went to one of the higher-ups and said, hey, this guy's being inappropriate,  they would just relocate the priest. 
[00:02:00]  Now they hand them over to the prosecutors of the states they're in.  But look at how long it's taken.  Somebody became a tattletale.  Right.  Couldn't keep that special secret.  What hit the paper today?  One of these guys was really into Nambla?  Yeah, yeah.  One of these priests.  Was that one in Boston or one from New York?  Oh, who the hell knows?  Was it Boston?  Yeah, Boston.  Man.  And everyone knew.  Everyone knew this priest was deep into Nambla.  Really into it. 
[00:02:30]  Couldn't you tell with a big paper shopping bag in the confessional?  Crinkle, crinkle.  Well, thanks to the ACLU and a disgusting left-wing group like that, Nambla's allowed to exist.  Well, yeah.  The freedom of speech and whatever.  Some people say this is a disgrace, Jimmy.  Yeah, but we're not advocating sleeping or have a sex with a young boy.  Sure, it's hot, but we don't advocate it.  We're not a real organization.  And people get mad about it.  You know, you want to do something. 
[00:03:00]  You know, go.  I almost said firebomb somebody, but I'm not going to say it.  No, no, that's not a smart thing to say it.  I think the.  Hold on, I got a little ditty, yeah?  Oh, do you?  A little ditty.  We're the North American man-boy lovers associate.  I got a whole song.  We love boys and they love us.  We're Nambla and we're proud.  Nambla, Nambla, all join hands and brush away the cloud. 
[00:03:30]  We're the men of Nambla, raise your heads, be proud.  We're the men of Nambla, raise your heads, be proud.  Thank you.  That's a D-star original.  Usually we like to sing along, but we didn't sing along with D on that one.  No, no, no.  Here I am, no.  How did he know the entire Nambla theme song? 
[00:04:00]  I actually take it back.  That song got me all revved up.  Didn't it play the feel-good song?  I apologize, Nambla.  Me and my snap judgments.  You know what the difference is, though, where they get this freedom of speech,  they get protection under the Constitution,  is I don't understand how they can get it when they're advocating permitting a crime like that.  I don't know if you, like, it's a difference between saying stuff and actually doing things.  Like, it's an organization that participates in criminal acts. 
[00:04:30]  That alone should shut you down.  If you just talk about it, I guess you gotta, you know, you gotta let them talk about it.  Well, you know they skirt the legal issues, you know.  It's like, you know, they say, we just advocate loving young boys, not Western, you know.  Oh, is that what they say?  I don't say, I'm guessing.  You know the charter? Can you recite the charter?  I'm just guessing.  I bet.  You know, I should have a bunch of bunch of disgraceful old, you know, schoolteachers and librarians 
[00:05:00]  tucking their shirts over their fat bellies and touching them.  They should just be shot.  All right, a couple phone numbers.  A little freedom of speech, I should.  I understand.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, give us a call.  866-277-4WOW.  I know one city that will not be calling us today.  That city?  Austin, Texas.  Austin.  I brought something for the show today.  Because I know everybody wants to contact the man who took the O&A show off the air in Austin. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  But they can't hear us right now.  It doesn't matter.  There's plenty of people that would just like to send an email to a person who does things in a cowardly fashion.  Because, you know, you're going to take something off and say, hey, look, we're moving four nights.  All right, but this is a grown man named Scooter.  And I think old Scooter would have some emails.  Scooter from Austin.  That's shocking.  Beautiful.  Is Scooter responsible for taking the show off the air in Austin?  That's what the hole said.  And whoever answered some hole said it.  Jim Norton has been calling all day as a disgruntled listener. 
[00:06:00]  I'm calling as me.  I don't say my name.  I don't pretend I'm not me.  So you spoke to a desk slit?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I said, stand up in your heart.  I'm like, thank you.  Let me give you a grown man named Scooter's email address.  It's Scooter B.  S-C-O-O-G-E-R-B.  Letter B.  At Beat1043.com.  The number 104.3.  That's Scooter B at Beat1043.com. 
[00:06:30]  Great.  Great.  Go Scooter.  There you go.  You might want to say, hey, we don't think that's the way to do things.  You don't just see the show off the air.  That's okay.  We're losing markets like crazy, Anthony.  We always win in the end.  Well, you know.  Oof.  Wow.  They're just, uh.  They're dropping like flies now.  Oh, they're just pulling out left and right, I guess, abandoning our show, Opie.  Well, that's what the critics say. 
[00:07:00]  Exactly.  Now that Opie and Anthony's ratings are dropping and they're losing affiliates left and right,  what do you think the problem is?  Shut up.  How long?  I predict they'll be done in six months.  Right.  Keep predicting.  The predictions.  You said four years ago.  We're still here.  Like a cancerous tumor you can't get rid of.  Right.  All right.  Anyway, we've got a lot to do today.  I brought something to the table today. 
[00:07:30]  What do you got?  A little surprise for Anthony and a little surprise for old Jimmy Nord.  A surprise.  Is Scooter B here?  Well, today we're doing the wildest, the strangest, the most unusual, I don't know, the oddest.  Yeah, bring something down.  How many more adjectives can we use in this stupid contest?  Yes, but basically we have a trip to L.A. to see MTV Icon with Aerosmith this weekend.  Right.  We did this in Boston.  You know about Spleen Guy by now.  I hope you do.  Oh, of course.  So we're doing the same contest here in New York, and we're going to try to see if New 
[00:08:00]  York could outdo Boston, Anthony.  Yes.  So we're looking for people.  It's an open-door policy today.  You come down with those crazy things, and we'll be the judge of what you got.  And someone walks away with a trip to L.A. today.  All right?  Nice.  Well, one of your favorites is coming down today, Anthony.  Someone you met on Friday.  One of my favorites.  She is going to try to win the contest again.  On Friday?  Friday when we were brought to us live.  Oh, no, no, no, no. 
[00:08:30]  We only had one she that entered the contest in Boston, and that would be the lactating mom.  Yeah, but it's like, what is she?  She didn't win for the spleen thing.  It makes her think she's squirting a little.  It's going to put her over the top.  She was able to shoot, what, eight to ten feet?  Yeah.  Do you remember what I said during that show, Anthony?  Uh, Christ, do I want to get back to New York?  No.  Uh, I said, you know, you would have had a better shot if you brought in one of your kids. 
[00:09:00]  Because remember, she was bragging how she breastfeeds the kids later to their, uh...  All right.  Don't even go any further.  I'm resigning from the show right now.  But do you remember the whole story?  Yes, I do.  Do you remember?  Do you remember when I asked you, this chick is a little, a bit twisted.  Yeah.  And, uh, she's really into this lactating thing.  Yeah, she's, uh...  She likes to preach.  I think she wants to...  Closing a lot of leche.  Yeah, I think she wants to preach the Bible of lactating all over the, all over America at this point. 
[00:09:30]  She's very into breastfeeding.  She, it's almost like a religion to her.  And as I recall, she, uh, breastfeeds her children very late in age.  Well, yes.  Most women wean their children within the first year sometime, right?  Listen to this, ladies, that are listening to the O&A show today.  She believes that it's perfectly normal to breastfeed your kid up to the age of four.  Four.  You know, when there are little toddlers walking around, walking around the house, asking for stuff, speaking. 
[00:10:00]  Mother, may I have a breast?  In between, uh, SpongeBob SquarePants, whatever that shit is.  Right.  SquarePants, SpongeBob.  In between little cute little Disney videos.  Barney.  Um, whatever.  So, uh, I casually suggest that on Friday, if she brought one of these kids down, she'd have a better shot at the, uh, trip.  Now, stop.  She happens to be from New Jersey, and she drove from New Jersey to Boston to be part of this contest on Friday, because she really likes Aerosmith that much. 
[00:10:30]  Ladies and gentlemen, she is coming by with one of her kids who is pushing for.  Hold it.  Look, I gotta know something right now.  A kid that is...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  A kid that is pushing for will be, uh, you know what?  No!  I'm today on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Is she gonna feed the kid?  Yeah.  She's feeding with the kid who's pushing for that. 
[00:11:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What on her way to for?  Why is there something so completely wrong about this?  If she's the mother, I don't know, because it's gonna look like a...  A hard kid who looks like a midget?  Oh, my God.  That's not...  There's something not right, Jordan.  Stop it.  What if she finds out it's not a kid at all?  It's just me and a little mumbusta.  That's no baby.  That's fidget. 
[00:11:30]  Ah, go chase yourself.  Ah!  So that is happening on the show today.  Why, I, I...  Also, I guess, uh, someone called Scott Perel this morning.  Yeah, I heard about this one.  We might have lost our morning guy today, by the way.  I think he walked out in the middle of the show, and...  Does anyone know why?  Did he blow up?  You're a little off on your date, Opie, but pretty close.  What the hell is that?  Fire alarm?  Fire alarm.  Ah, no one pays attention to this one.  Never.  Um, anyway, this guy called Scott Perel this morning, Anthony. 
[00:12:00]  And he has in his possession, um...  I'll just say it.  I, I should use the medical term.  Oh, you, you, you should?  Well, what is it?  That's what we're assuming.  Realistically speaking, uh, plain English, he has a, uh, a dead baby in a jar.  I like to refer to it as a pickled punk.  Pickled punk.  But it is, uh, indeed a dead baby in a jar that he's bringing in. 
[00:12:30]  Can you get the, can you get the, the, the, the, the laxating in that?  Oh, my God.  Imagine her feeding the pickled punk.  And then eating its spleen.  And you tickle this little pickled punk.  And it won't kick at all.  And that's all we know that's coming so far.  Right.  Wow.  You know, that's two really good contenders right there. 
[00:13:00]  I'm hoping the guy that has those, um, endangered species, uh, might come by.  Endangered species.  You know, the guy that parted in the Siberian Tiger last night.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  Last time he wanted to bring, uh, a baby elephant up here.  But, uh, the building had a problem with that.  A little problem with the baby elephant.  I think he had a red-ass baboon that he wanted to bring, too.  This guy had a baby elephant downstairs.  Really?  In a, in a truck on 56th Street.  Do you think we can get the, uh, the baboon to wear a black pants and a shirt and a hat together? 
[00:13:30]  Right.  Never mind, right?  No, yes.  So, uh, well, I just like the way sometimes they dress him up in movies and stuff.  Well, you ever see the orangutan in any which way but loose?  Or, uh, any which way you can.  So, so that's what we got, uh, so far for the show.  Right.  And we're looking for other people.  I mean, other people are going to surprise me with their things.  Not everyone's calling in with what they're bringing down.  What wins?  Uh, a four-year-old suckling, pushing for him.  Or a dead baby.  The child. 
[00:14:00]  I have to say that.  I can't say this show anymore.  It's hard to say because one is really sexy and one is really funny.  Right?  I mean, I know, you know, breastfeeding I never thought would be funny.  But I said, all right, I got where you're going, you idiot.  The one joke you didn't have to explain.  You sent me subtle over there.  I'm sorry.  I think listeners can figure out your humor.  I apologize.  I don't love this.  I really don't.  There he is.  I don't live at the top.  Don, what's going on?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  All right, who are you?  Hey, man. 
[00:14:30]  Uh, this is Don.  I live in Nagsall, Kansas.  And, uh, I just thought I picked you guys up the other day.  And, uh, I liked the show.  What?  Yes.  I think this is a fib over.  A.M. 1460.  We're on in Kansas?  Yeah, I don't know how it is.  I'm just looking through the stations.  There's not much to really listen to out here.  There's not many, uh, good radio stations.  And I heard you guys talking.  Why the hell are we on in Kansas?  What?  How far from Vegas are we?  I'm sorry, Dan.  Are you picking us up from another city?  I don't know.  Come give me a map.  I live in the middle of six, but, you know. 
[00:15:00]  What's the name of the, uh, station?  Uh, I don't know exactly if one of them turns, but, uh, I'll take.  But, uh, it's somewhere between 14 and 16 on the A.M. dial.  So I'm assuming it's something like 1460.  So I don't talk station.  All right, well, uh, all right.  Hey, what's up, Kansas?  And I want to give a props out to Philly!  Are you from Philly?  Fill it up for you, baby!  I was just breaking some stones there.  You went that far to say hi to Philly, wasn't it?  That's it, Philly, baby!  You've been giving too much attention to Boston lately, and there are pussies out in Ohio. 
[00:15:30]  You're getting out of your fancy stones.  What?  Already?  Philly?  We were just down at the Jim Norton show.  Stop it!  Yeah.  Come back!  We can see how much attention they give the people in Ohio this weekend when I'm standing  here with Keith Robinson, and they're like, where's O'Neal?  Like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right, here we go.  I knew these calls were going to come in today.  Kyle, what's up?  Dude, this is wrong, man.  What?  Is this a little boy or a little girl? 
[00:16:00]  Do we know?  It's a boy.  Yeah, I think it's a son.  Her son.  That'sôn.  She says it's perfectly normal for a kid that's fishing board to be breastfeeding.  You guys are going to hell.  Hey, man, it's not my kid.  Yeah, right.  You're going to hell.  All right, thank you.  All right, Chrissy wants you in here.  Chrissy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I just have to say, you know, after two years old, man, that's child abuse right there.  Not as far as she's concerned.  She says the average, what's the worldwide average age that a child is weaned? 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  She told us that.  Wasn't it something like 18 years?  Yeah.  I've seen it.  I've seen, like, toddlers breastfeed, and I think it makes me sick to my stomach.  I'm a woman, and it makes me ill.  Chrissy, not only that, the kids wound up getting Austin Powers teeth.  Chrissy.  From the mill.  And I also wanted to say, I haven't seen you guys, and, like, when you guys were up here,  I didn't get to see you guys, but.  We've only been back six or seven times. 
[00:17:00]  You have city hours?  City hours.  That's what I said.  Oh, I thought she said the other thing there.  All right.  Well, come by and say hi.  We like seeing the old faces.  All righty.  Not saying you're old, but from the time we were up there.  You know the deal.  Yeah, I got that.  All right, Chrissy.  Bob from D.C. saying that a friend of mine dropped his two-and-a-half-year-old daughter  off at the babysitter's house for the afternoon.  The babysitter had an infant of her own.  Upon return, the babysitter breastfeeding his two-and-a-half-year-olds. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Hand That Rocks the Cradle.  Is that the movie?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That was a hot scene.  Really weird.  That's a chick from Risky Business.  We've got her name on it, man.  It's a crystal blue eye.  Could that serve any type of thing for a mother?  I don't even mean a sexual turn-on.  If you breastfeed too long, could that be like some type of self-serving thing done by a woman?  Well, yeah.  That's what I said.  This girl will talk about breastfeeding until you're blue in the face.  No, but she's doing it.  I'm saying, could you be breastfeeding too long for someone's self-gratification? 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Some kind of to feel maybe that you want to serve more of a purpose in the child's life  for a long period of time.  There's sort of a, there's something going on there.  What a mama boy she raised.  Oh, my God.  There's the kid that's going to be breastfeeding right there.  Look up.  You're knocking me on the air.  Let me see.  Let me see.  He's got a little Boston Red Sox cap on.  Does he look like little Adam Walsh?  Hey, keep her out.  Keep her out.  We'll get to her in a minute.  You're insane, Anthony.  I love getting Norton to just look at me in utter disgust. 
[00:18:30]  And then, like, with love in his eyes right after that.  This is admiration.  This is wrong.  I just saw the kid.  The kid will be able to walk up to mom and jump up on her lap.  A little baseball cap.  Let me take a look.  Get him by the window.  You don't win a trip to L.A., but his dishes have to give her Sears.  Oh, I'll wash him down with something.  You know how that gets you.  Let me see.  Where is it?  Back to the kid. 
[00:19:00]  Open the door.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Look at George with a little Red Sox hat on.  Oh, my God.  Hello, 40-year-old Sean Morial.  Should I put you smiling and waving and laughing?  Why is he wearing a Red Sox hat?  Does he have tryouts?  How old is this kid?  He's a little idiot.  Oh, my God.  That's not a kid.  That's no more Garcia Pyle.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I think it's good.  Hey, there. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  He's smiling.  Look at him.  His mouth is always small.  He's smiling.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Leave.  Close the door, Rex.  Dude, I can't.  Dude, this cannot happen.  This kid's like a lazy grown-up little kid.  You know what?  The good thing about that is it won't make him too dependent on the mother.  You know what I mean?  It's always helpful.  I'll have a rest of the day.  Mother blood.  She was a horn, Norman.  He's on his way to dentistry school real fast. 
[00:20:00]  Is he walking?  Oh, my God.  He's walking around.  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Can I get a cup of coffee before I breastfeed?  Yo, I'd like to grab one that ain't my mom's.  You're going to hear this, too?  Have you been watching the game?  There's a little act.  I mean, take your pain to go out.  No, no, no.  Tell her.  Hold on.  Tell her.  Hold on.  Tell her.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  All right.  Wait.  Tell her to hold on.  She's got to hold on. 
[00:20:30]  Let the kid wait.  If it doesn't happen on the air, she's out of the car.  Let the kid wait.  Let me tell you something.  I just saw the kid doing the beat.  What bugs me is when she picks him up.  Let him just stand there.  He's thinking, I'll just lean over.  No.  Did she stop?  Did she stop?  Why didn't she hold on the kid?  He dripped down far enough.  This is, oh, my God.  Ah, Sticker Face.  Yo.  What's up, man? 
[00:21:00]  What's up?  Hold on a sec.  Are you Sticker Face from when we were?  What's up?  Are you the Sticker Face guy when we were up there in Boston?  Yeah, that's me.  All right.  What's up, bro?  What's up?  Um, dude, at the ECM Studios, man, she, that lady kept going to the porn store across the  street.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, the porn store that's right across the street there?  Yeah?  Yeah.  What was she getting?  Like, she went with this strange dude.  I swear she was giving him treats.  Oh, you don't know anything.  Well, I'm just saying, any lady who's going to bring her child on national radio and breastfeed 
[00:21:30]  him when he's, like, 12, something I like that.  All right.  Thank you, Sticker Face.  I'd like a doctor or somebody to call in.  Like, I don't know.  Maybe it is, like, healthy.  I don't know.  I mean, I don't have any kids.  She'll let you know.  No, but I mean, I want another person who's not a part of it, too.  You know, like a doctor or somebody.  I mean, I would have kids.  Yeah, we should get an expert in the face.  Because we're trying to hire an expert for the show so people don't die.  Hey, Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Great show.  Great show.  Oh, thanks. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, guys.  Got any room for some listeners up here or what?  Oh, you sick man.  Good job, guys.  It's not gay if we don't make eye contact, Dennis.  Just two friends helping me.  Ah, little tug.  Let me go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I was just wondering.  I was up there last year for the Moo Challenge.  I'm pushing 20 now.  Can I come over and get Brad Spence today?  Oh, I'm ready.  Mom.  Huh?  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  All right, Larry.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, I'll make a good point here. 
[00:22:30]  Joe, what's up?  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  This is just as bad.  He's getting a hummer from your chick.  She won't stop looking at you for that sign of approval.  He's going to have a four-year-old's eye peering at you.  Does the kid, like, give the eye?  Well, he's on the nipple.  He can look at you.  Looking around the room.  He's on the nipple.  You're going to have to know whether he's turning on.  Enough, enough.  Enough, we let you get away with that word.  Hey, dude, dude, dude.  Don't you hate that little look of approval a girl gives you?  I don't mind a sexy look.  Like, what if a girl's, you know, doing treats and she looks sexy? 
[00:23:00]  Look to the side once in a while.  Focus on what you're doing.  Just for a minute.  Well, you're not going to look at me.  I'm not going to give you direction.  Do it for the love of just taking a big, thick one and stop looking for just, you know,  please approve of me.  Please think I'm special.  The other thing is, you're going to be in this kid's memory.  He's going to have this room full of people, your images, and it's mine when he's older.  He's going to have this, you know, hey, when I was a kid.  I was a man, my mom was a man.  My thing.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Mommy, why was...  I got to interrupt you because the doctor's calling in.  Oh, good.  She's very busy. 
[00:23:30]  Thank God.  This is Jessica.  What's up, Jessica?  Hi.  Hi.  Are you really a doctor?  I really am.  What type of doctor?  Actually, I'm a dermatologist.  Oh.  You know a lot about this.  But I did go to general medical school.  All right.  I was originally calling before you even mentioned the doctor because I've heard, although I don't  have any kids, that women do get a sexual pleasure out of breastfeeding.  Oh, yeah.  So that's definite.  So maybe that's why she's doing this so long, you know, with excuses.  Is the age of four abnormal? 
[00:24:00]  I think it sounds a little abnormal for American culture.  You know what?  All you have to do is see the kid and know that it's not normal.  The kid is walking around talking out there.  It's absolutely not normal.  I mean, you know he's going to end up screwed up even if he can't tell.  I feel sorry for his girlfriend in the future.  All right, Jessica.  Thank you.  One thing I'll say is I don't want to hear about...  He won't be a boot man, though.  I hear if you breastfeed as a kid, you're not really a boot man.  I did, and I'm not.  You're right.  Huh?  Wait, you did what? 
[00:24:30]  I breastfed when I was very young.  I mean, obviously, I was dumb.  And you're not...  I like breastfed nutmeg.  Tom from Billy.  It's too bad Louis Black was in yesterday because someone's getting arrested today.  You know what bugs me is that this is the world average.  I don't want to hear what they do in Africa or other countries where they don't have the  same food.  Where they don't have McDonald's.  Exactly.  Right.  You know, when you're living in dirt, you have nothing but, you know, milk to drink.  Well, you drink it, but when you have other options, get a hold of yourself and move on.  All right, Bob, what's up?  Yeah, hey, the woman's already there and ready to go. 
[00:25:00]  I want to know how the hell you guys are going to postpone this until 520.  This is how we trick you guys.  We got to keep you thinking at all times.  Right.  We will not postpone this.  The kid that's pushing for will do the deed right after the commercials.  Right.  See you, guys.  All right.  Bobby Big Rigger, real fast here.  Bobby Big Rigger.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  One quick point.  If I can quote Rick.  Is this legal?  This is legal, isn't it?  There you go.  Hey, also, how sick is it once the kid gets done?  He wanders over into the john and pulls down his underoos. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Stop, you sick asshole.  What the hell is wrong with you?  The worst would be watching.  Dude, that's not the sound, though.  I know.  Yeah.  Some of a cookie in one hand.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Oh, yeah.  Today's going to be very interesting, my friends.  Looking for the wildest, the strangest, the most unusual, the oddest, the craziest.  Use whatever damn adjective you need to use.  But you bring it down here, and the best one we've seen today, we'll win a trip to L.A. 
[00:26:00]  to see MTV Icon with Aerosmith.  Okay?  Roy.  Also on the way, besides, you know, the lactating lady there, we got a song about Black Girl.  Uh-huh.  We got a guy who's trying to be Earl's replacement.  Earl's replacement.  We're casting a brand new Black Earl for the show.  And Sam Kinison's brother's calling in today.  Lots to do.  Lots to do.  Yes.  And, of course, the Wesley Willis song of the day, Anthony.  Yeah.  All on the way on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:26:30]  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go at this stuff, Opie.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's going to be a wild day.  The guy with the pickle pump has arrived, Anthony.  Yeah.  Looking for the wildest.  The strangest.  The craziest.  The oddest.  The kookiest.  The most insane.  And, uh, boy, we sure are working on that. 
[00:27:00]  We got a great, uh, start anyway.  Yep.  The pickled punk.  Not only that, we got, um, a woman, uh, out there, the, the lactating woman who likes  to, she knows everything about breastfeeding.  Very happy with it.  He's got a kid who's, uh, who's going to be, uh, breastfeeding.  He breastfeeds him.  He does this all the time.  And, uh, I hear he's hungry.  Oh, he's very hungry.  And we have a little audio of him right outside. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, really?  What he was just saying, like, a couple of minutes ago, because he could tell he's hungry.  Yeah.  He has a little voice.  Let's play this.  Get your balls and kick it off now.  Wow.  Yeah.  Boy, he sounded hungry, didn't he?  Sounds more like he's pushing six and pushing four.  Can I get a scooter B update?  Uh, yeah.  Scooter B update.  Look at the old scooter.  From the, uh, the way, from the real, real man, uh, area of the law school, where they just  dropped shows, uh, telling everybody, he, uh, sent an email to a guy, Daniel.  Yeah.  And Daniel wrote, because, you know, ONA fans really don't, they kind of get to the 
[00:28:00]  point quickly.  He wrote, you blow, Opie and Anthony will destroy you.  And this, and this smug hillbilly with a white shirt and no courage wrote back, actually, Opie  and Anthony will make me a wealthy man.  They work for the same company I do.  Ain't that a kick in the arse?  And he wrote arse.  Did it?  Real company man.  That's why he's not on the radio.  Oh, who do you mean?  Oh, you mean, uh, oh, Scooter B.  Scooter B.  At Beat1043.com. 
[00:28:30]  And that would be .com.  I really am a sinless zilch.  Pleasure4B.com.  And Scooter B makes our special list.  Yes.  Yeah.  That we're putting together.  Our special list.  You don't want to be on our special list.  The S list.  It's special.  Look at Scooter B being all cocky down there.  Yeah.  Because he had no balls.  Yeah.  He had no balls to call us and say, hey, guys.  You know, he has every right to drop the show, but he didn't even have the balls to call us up and say, hey, guys, you know, we've thought about this. 
[00:29:00]  And it's not the direction we want to go in after all.  Even though we, you know, we only gave you guys five weeks.  Right.  You know.  All right.  So we do have the trip to L.A. to give way.  Yes.  So, I mean, we're looking for a lot of people to come down with their stuff.  Uh-huh.  And you try to amaze us.  One person that amazes us the most will win the trip to come down with the goods. 
[00:29:30]  So why don't we, why don't we, how do you want to do this?  Could the kid walk around by himself for a little while?  Because I want to talk to the mom.  Walk around.  I'm going to get a cup of coffee.  Ask me to watch the kid, because, you know, we want to talk to the mom, and, you know, we have morals.  We don't want the kid hearing what we're going to say to his mom.  Stop.  What's that that mommy's feeding him?  Where is she? 
[00:30:00]  Bring her in.  All right.  Here comes dinner over there.  And I'm going to warn people that I want to listen to the show Friday.  This lady is highly annoying.  And she's, like, all about breastfeeding.  I'm trying to talk to Sully from Godsmack, and this one's chewing my ear off about breastfeeding.  I'm like, okay, I get it.  He's a rock star, and she's just piping in.  This is cool.  What are you doing there on this Munchausen-Poxy-By-Syndrome? 
[00:30:30]  Whatever it's called.  Munchausen-Syndrome-By-Poxy.  You ever hear of that?  I absolutely do, and I'm so not that.  All right.  Yeah, there's still time in your future.  Hey, is it true you went to the porno shop across from the radio station, Mom?  Yes, it is.  Ooh, what'd you pick up?  Is it true you brought some guys over there?  Actually, someone approached me.  Ooh.  And what happened?  That man, Jimmy Norton.  We're hearing rumors.  Oh, no.  We're hearing rumors, and I would rather, you know, if it's true, you say something.  Thank you. 
[00:31:00]  I appreciate the opportunity to speak.  Yeah, someone came up.  He said his name was Steve.  He was from the Avalon Club.  And he was there to spend $40 on pornography for...  Oh, okay.  I understand now.  Were there two or three magazines you picked out for your home?  Was it German one?  Because I was there.  Yeah.  I offered to advise him on what Mr. Norton liked the porno shop.  They were pretty good.  I looked at them in Jimmy's dressing room.  Motor dressing room.  Over there. 
[00:31:30]  They were laying all over the dressing room, as well as other things, and strippers and whatnot.  I love that porno shop.  Wonderful, wonderful backstage area that Jimmy Norton had going.  And actually, it was a video shot, and in the back there was pornography, so it was pretty much...  Yeah, but we're hearing other things, like you might have done something to get a ticket for Jimmy Norton's show.  Really?  I believe I was on the guest list by Jimmy Norton's show.  Yeah.  Okay.  And this guy was full of air.  Of course he was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's some rumors going around Boston that you might have did something with a guy in the basement of the radio station. 
[00:32:00]  Something like nursing?  You get a ticket, yeah.  Absolutely not.  Isn't that ridiculous?  No girl has never drank out of a mule to get tickets to see my idiocy.  I'm not a rock band.  Hold on a second.  Jamie, what's going on?  Hey, I was wondering if you have a policeman to pick this board up when she's done.  I have a four-year-old girl when breastfeeding's on.  She knows how to read, for God's sake.  Yeah.  She's going to be breastfeeding. 
[00:32:30]  Hooked on boobies.  See, a lot of people are saying that, yeah, the kid shouldn't be breastfeeding at this age there.  Um, yeah, that's, that's correct.  They are saying that, but the truth of the matter is it's perfectly legal and it's perfectly normal.  Laliche does have a 4.2 international weaning age.  We heard the Laliche stuff, right?  Can I, can I ask you something, though?  Yeah.  I know that, uh, a lot of freedoms have been given to women to breastfeed in public and whatnot.  Is there a restriction on that as far as age goes? 
[00:33:00]  No, uh, nationally, uh, some states have affirmed the rights of women to breastfeed.  But isn't that considered something like child endangerment or something?  If, if you have a kid who's eight years old, right, you're laying in, uh, let's just pick Central Park here in, uh, Manhattan on a beautiful summer day.  And the eight-year-old kid is, uh, suckling.  Wouldn't the police come over and go, all right, there's a difference now between what the child is doing for nourishment and feeding 
[00:33:30]  and maybe some kind of, uh, a scene that could be, uh, interpreted as pornograph?  That's right, but eight-year-olds don't nurse.  If you do leave it up to a natural weaning age, the age is usually around when they potty train, usually between three and four.  Uh, children will tell you when they are finished.  Literally.  Hey, I'm done.  Hey, man.  Yeah, it's a slow one.  I'm off the nip.  I'm, I'm off the nip now.  I'm, I got a meeting.  I got my chip.  Quit in cold turkey.  I've been, I've been clean for three months. 
[00:34:00]  I'm on the wagon.  Yeah, it is, uh, stated in the laws of the nation that,  the appropriate age for women and children to stop breastfeeding is the age with, which they're both agreed.  Really?  I don't, I don't like this international average thing.  Only because, I don't want to hear what some third world monkeys are doing.  Exactly.  Because, you know, they're swinging from those things, uh, well into the teens.  Yeah, what's the age in?  The more.  Okay, every nation that's developed, like, Germany, Japan. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Sweden, most of the Scandinavian countries have weaning ages that are well packed.  Those of the United States.  It seems somehow the United States and their consciousness about the breast is falling quite far behind.  I don't know.  I think, I think as far as you're concerned, uh, your, your son there should stop when he gets a girlfriend to pick up on.  To take up where you left off.  Hey, hey, mom, are you going to stop, uh, before the kid, uh, hits kindergarten? 
[00:35:00]  Uh, yeah, they usually stop around four.  Actually, I don't vaccinate my children also.  No, huh?  Which also is totally legal and within your rights.  Well, how is that legal?  But there aren't there things you can't send them to school if they're not vaccinated?  There are, but there is a wonderful little, uh, federal form that you fill out and you just, uh, mention the word God.  Oh, boy, are you kidding me?  Well, we've bowed under to that?  Don't you believe in modern medicine at all?  And then the advances and, you know, many children have been saved by, uh, these shots. 
[00:35:30]  Uh, well, actually, if you talk to Jonas Salk, who invented the polio.  Is he still alive?  I do, he is, yes.  Yes.  Um, he, he invented the, uh, polio vaccine and for a long, long time they were giving the live vaccine in the United States when in Europe for many years they were giving the dead vaccine.  And he'll be the first to tell you that any outbreaks of, uh, polio in recent years were a result of the live vaccine. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  Now, as a result, the United States gives the dead vaccine.  It happens, you know, you get a couple of kids walking around with the water on the brain and stuff.  That's just one thing.  What are you going to do?  Someone has to take one for the team.  Right, it's called, uh, advancing, you know.  You gotta, you gotta take a few chances.  But you think that breast milk is just the, uh, epitome of, uh, health and, uh.  It's liquid gold, yes.  It keeps it with liquid gold.  Such a North Star.  Certain things I enjoy.  Liquid gold, literally. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, uh.  In a world full of immune, uh, suppression.  Depression, depression, it's really good to pump the immune system up with stuff made for it.  Like breast milk.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, what up, bud?  Hey.  Does he look like Babyface Pinter?  Does he, like, got the cigar in his mouth and he's, like, tattooed?  Oh, Pinter.  Oh, Pinter, baby.  Pinter, you naughty baby.  No, he doesn't look, uh, like Babyface, but, uh, I, I noticed that he's, uh, taking this  baseball cap and he's putting it on backwards, getting ready. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, he's getting ready.  Well, the brim.  He's getting ready.  The brim will hit a little bit.  Putting on some chapstick.  You know.  Getting all ready.  Now, uh, what does he say?  What does he say to you?  Most babies, you've got to read their, uh, delicate language of crying.  They're hungry, I'll be.  Let's stick to the facts.  We're not talking about a baby today.  Right, that's what I mean.  Most, that's what I'm saying.  Babies, babies go like, you know, they cry and you figure out, all right, the diaper isn't 
[00:37:30]  dirty, so they must be hungry.  Now, your, your son here comes up to you and says what?  Mama, I want swimming.  That's Norton's pickup line.  The baby with Norton on.  I want, I want Nanny.  Norton says on 11th Avenue.  This kid is two weeks away from faxing his request.  He'll page you.  Lursty, 911.  Yeah.  There's also, um, let me just call you a Nanny, saying, hey, idiot, I should be finished 
[00:38:00]  with this.  Not a Nanny.  Does he have a website, uh, called suckabullet.com?  He does not.  He'll be breastfeeding a town hall on April 18th.  Along with the extended breastfeeding, uh, I also adhere to the child-led weaning, family  bed.  Family bed.  Oh, you don't, you don't skate over family bed.  What is family bed?  How many years I've tried to get that going, but family bed, uh, is basically under the 
[00:38:30]  umbrella of a thing called attachment parenting.  Attachment parenting, which is under the bigger umbrella of psychobabble.  Doesn't this sound like very, like, uh, what would you call it, Opie?  Kind of crazy.  No, no.  Independence.  It's called a weird, uh, mothering.  You know, not mothering.  Sort of a new age type philosophy.  Maybe going back to the old stuff. 
[00:39:00]  Really?  So what is, what is this, uh, family bed thing that, uh, happens?  Well, family bed is basically make sure you get a king bed if you plan on having a lot  of kids because during the night they're going to creep in and, uh, when you are a breastfeeding  mother, exclusively breastfeeding, that means don't supplement with bottles.  You'll, especially in the first three months of life, the baby wants to nurse every two  hours.  Right.  So go ahead and get out of the bed every two hours.  All right.  Hold on.  So they sleep with you.  Right.  Tell me your three-year-old, uh, runs into bed with you, pushing four, and, uh, and then 
[00:39:30]  just goes to town.  Uh, Andrew, my three-year-old, does have a Bob the Builder bed of his island.  Bob the Builder bed.  Bob the Builder.  He helped make it.  Bob the Builder bed of his own.  Yes, he does.  And what about your other children?  They have separate rooms of their own.  But do they come into bed with you?  No.  No.  Okay.  Well, don't look at me like I'm crazy for asking.  Well, they're, they're eight and ten years old.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Of course, you know, the bed is available to them.  They want to watch a movie or watch a movie.  That's all normal stuff.  That's regular.  Yeah.  That's pretty normal stuff.  I mean, but, I mean, but the kid jumps in bed and just starts, uh, going to town.  Well, do you sleep in the noon?  Uh, yes, I do.  So the kid is in the bed with you, and you're, uh, completely naked.  That's incredible.  You know, I hate to break the news to you.  That's right.  Stop it.  I kid you not.  He came out of there?  He absolutely did.  Yeah.  You know what the thing is?  That's why whenever, and I'll, I'll explain my, my take on this whole thing. 
[00:40:30]  That is why, no matter how hard you try, no matter how hard you try to remember, you don't.  The good Lord and his infinite wisdom has found it best to eliminate any child's memory up to a certain point.  This includes seeing your mom naked.  I believe.  He came out of there.  I mean, think about it.  Technically, I started in my dad's yam bag, but you don't see the yodeling. 
[00:41:00]  No, we don't see it.  You may hear it.  Nice tongue, Martin.  Oh, look at that.  What are you doing in there, yodeling?  Elbow, elbow?  Actually, I don't consider kids under four people.  I think I consider them babies.  They don't really have gender.  They don't have a sexuality at that point.  They should be bought and sold.  No, I mean, they're babies.  Under the umbrella of not people.  Hey, mom.  A lot of moms who have babies.  Mom, mom, mom, a lot of people want to know how big the dairy is. 
[00:41:30]  38 triple D.  38 triple D.  And what were you before you started the wonderful world of breastfeeding?  Another misconception.  The breast pretty much stays the same maybe the first couple of months when you are engorged,  when your milk has not been regulated, your breast will maybe fill up to maybe another cup's die.  But whether you have a 32A breast or a 38 triple D like I do, the milk production is exactly the same.  How about that, O.P.? 
[00:42:00]  A lot of people want to know what mom looks like.  I'm a fat chick with tight clothes.  I'll say it.  You look like you were probably a looker before Bob Dylan plugged in.  Hey, don't mention my boyfriend's name.  Real?  You're not a fat chick, though.  You're wrong, I think.  You're not a fat chick.  Oh, I like you more and more and more.  God, believe me, I'd love to insult you, but you're not.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, should we take a break and get this over with?  You mean, why aren't we going to do it this break, Opie? 
[00:42:30]  No, I could handle it.  Well, I don't know if I could handle this one.  No, you can't.  I'm ready for it.  I'm doing a good thing, Opie.  Do you do this in public at all, like if you're out?  I do it wherever he wants.  Do you get reaction in a mall?  I get reaction.  I go to the bathroom and do that.  Once a TGIF manager of Blackwood came up to me and said,  could you please go do that in the bathroom?  I said, could you please sit in the back of the bus?  Whoa.  Yeah.  You know what, don't I have a TGIF manager?  Yeah, because they're the same thing. 
[00:43:00]  I'm going to say why he's right.  Because it is a natural thing.  There's not a pin for that, that TGIF, huh?  Got a little flare.  Put some flare on there.  Here's my breastfeeding pin.  Yeah, you know what?  Cute little Cub Scout hats.  This bond between mother and kid.  Look, man.  All right, if I'm trying to eat or especially drink a milkshake,  I don't want to look at that.  And I think that you have the right to say go to the bed.  I don't think you should be boarded out of the establishment.  But I think that the manager says, hey, look.  It's usually a one. 
[00:43:30]  I know it's usually a man.  No, it's usually a third party.  In this case, it was a nine-month pregnant, I'd say, 22-year-old woman.  And she was horrifically offended.  And I don't blame her because the first pregnancy class I went to,  I sat down on the floor learning how to have a baby.  And this woman started breastfeeding this two-year-old boy.  I looked at my husband.  I said, oh, my God, she's doing that in front of us.  I was horrified.  I don't lie.  Here's what annoys me about the breastfeeding.  It's not that breastfeeding is wrong.  It's like, stop just showing me how natural it is. 
[00:44:00]  Have a little bit of pride.  I don't want to hear, well, it's perfectly that.  You know, you don't see me taking dumps or whacking my bag.  I'd love to be out in public.  99% of the time, Jim, that people, men, women, don't even notice I'm doing it.  And I do it on the beach, so they don't even know.  Okay, we're going to take a break.  It's totally discreet.  Can we get the kid to talk a little bit on the air?  He'll tell you everything you want to know, but don't freak him out.  Norton, are you going to stay in the room?  He might be coming out.  We will not freak out your kid, okay?  He's ready to feed.  All right.  Well, it'll go down next, Anthony.  All right.  He's playing football. 
[00:44:30]  He's playing football.  Yeah, it's one of your peers.  And he doesn't need to stand on anything to see over the table.  He's playing football.  All we ask is you don't do it in the baby fashion.  You let the kid kind of just hop up on your knees.  Sure.  Yeah, right.  You're sitting, standing, upside.  Believe me, a toddler has very interesting ways to nurse.  When he wants to eat, he will undress me and put the nini in his mouth.  He will take control. 
[00:45:00]  And you'll be able to witness all that next, right?  I'm hoping to know how hungry he is.  All right.  But you want to describe why we're doing all this?  Because we really want a nice seat in hell.  I'm hoping other people will come down and try to beat the mom here.  We're looking for somebody to, anybody, come down here and show us something very different,  very odd, something that will freak us out a bit, make us go, wow, that's something.  When the guy in Boston brought in his own spleen that had been removed and pulled it out of 
[00:45:30]  a little bucket, that was something that made us go, whoa, oh, my God.  Another guy ate a piece of the spleen.  This lovely lady right here, we used her bombs.  Yeah, like a fire hose.  So we're just looking for that.  Now, today, she is back to show us how she breasts people.  An adult son.  And we've got until about 6.30 to get down here because we've got to give away the trip. 
[00:46:00]  And it's a trip to L.A. to see MTV icon with Farismith, okay?  And this weekend, it's with special guest Kid Rock and Sum 41.  So very cool prize.  And, of course, a pickle pump, too, later on in the show.  Yes, but when we get back, dead baby in a jar.  A kid that is pushing four will be feeding off his mom.  Will you breastfeed the dead baby in the jar?  I don't do women.  I don't do, um...  That baby's in jar?  I don't do dead people, women. 
[00:46:30]  All right, all right.  Let's go to the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the opiate Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, I want to send a big F.U. to that cow, the French douchebag, Frenchie.  You have nothing in your handbag, you frog-talking, old smoker.  The black girl didn't say a word.  He made you look like the mule-loving French baggie you are.  So...  Cool.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big...  My girlfriend, Marianne.  Excuse me, my ex-girlfriend, Marianne.  Down at school, thinks she's all hot. 
[00:47:00]  Now that I'm back home, go...  Have fun with that kid down the hallway.  You bitch.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a huge F.U. to the goddamn prick that stole the wheel off the front of my car,  right out behind my restaurant where I work.  Listen, if I catch you around my restaurant, I'll shove a French baguette up your ass.  Next message.  Yeah, it's a big...  You dog, ass.  But can't do the...  Feed women on the way home.  Must be nice to have all the...  ...time in the world, you sorry twat.  End of message. 
[00:47:30]  Hopi and Anthony are in the latest shock jobs to hit it big.  But goddamn!  They are heavily into one thing.  Boobies.  Boobies.  Yes.  One of you, I don't know which one, said, Ben, you can pull out your business.  It's junk.  We're artists.  You present it as innocent, but I'm not so sure it is.  Screw you.  We're artists.  Is there anything you won't do for ratings?  We are publicity floor bags.  Publicity sluts.  We're artists.  It is all about money.  That's what it comes down to.  It's your mercenaries.  That's clever.  Aren't you mercenaries?  We're radio mercenaries, dickhead. 
[00:48:00]  We're artists.  We're entertainers.  We're not psychologists.  We're not doctors.  We're not daycare workers.  We're artists.  It's all on appearance.  None on you.  None on us.  We're artists.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  None on us.  And then you say it like this.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  You can do it.  The moment you've been waiting for.  A kid that is pushing for will be getting nourished by his mom. 
[00:48:30]  You can do it.  Yeah.  She feels it's perfectly okay.  Okay.  The lady's calling like crazy.  Very pissed off.  Mary, what's up?  Oh, yeah.  I was actually listening to the show Friday, and obviously I'm starting to listen to it again.  But I have plenty of friends.  We've all breastfed.  We've all been there. 
[00:49:00]  But you know there's a cutoff point.  And another thing that really gets me is if a mother holds it as sacred as she thinks  she does, and nothing against you, Opie and Anthony, I listen to you guys all the time,  you're not going to be on a radio station, your type of radio station at that, and to  breastfeed on a radio station.  I'm insulted.  Easy scooter.  She speaks the truth.  We all know we like to exploit.  Exactly.  And that's what you're wanting to do, and that's why we listen to you guys. 
[00:49:30]  But she can't sit there and tell me that this is a great experience, yada, yada, yada.  When you're going on a radio station, you're a type of radio station like that.  It's our type.  You know what?  She's so free and open with it that it doesn't matter where she does this.  Just don't say yada, yada, yada again.  And here's the thing.  I called my mother on the break before, because I was breastfed.  And I'm like, well, how old was I when I stopped?  And she said nine months.  And he said, can we make up the lost time?  Thank you, Mary. 
[00:50:00]  It'll be over tonight.  That's awful.  That's my mom.  And then horrible.  What a wreck.  Linda, what's up?  Damn you.  Hi.  I was actually outside Boston on Friday, and I think the lady's nasty.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  I want to know if she gets off on it.  She swears she doesn't.  She says no.  You know what?  The listeners are going to kill us, so why don't we get this over with you.  All right.  Bring her in.  Let's see if we can chat with the child a little bit. 
[00:50:30]  Get the Manchurian candidate and his mother in here.  Have a little chat with the little lad.  I don't know.  You know, I think my cutoff point is when the kid can walk.  You know what?  When the kid can remember.  That's what it is.  I am looking at him.  He's following.  He's got some Gatorade.  Why don't you pop him up by the microphone over there?  What's the little lad's first name?  What's your name?  What's your name there, little guy?  Welcome to here.  I'm too shy.  Wow.  He's a cute kid.  Is he adopted? 
[00:51:00]  No.  He's mine.  He's blonde and blue eyes.  I'm going to whack you.  What's your name?  Go ahead, Andrew.  Tell him.  Hitler would have loved him.  Perfect blonde hair and blue eyes.  Look at that tussleable head of hair.  Look at Norton's tussling.  His little head of hair.  Norton just tussled his hair.  He's a good kid.  So, uh, hi, Andrew.  How you doing?  Hi.  You look like a young Opie.  They don't think you can talk.  Would you talk?  Happily cheeks and blonde hair.  Hi there.  He's skinny. 
[00:51:30]  I'm getting skinnier by the minute if he doesn't feed.  You want to, uh, you want to say something?  You want to name me?  No.  You don't want to talk?  I like this kid.  He's not going to dance like a monkey for anyone.  I love it.  He's not.  I'm not talking, stupid.  Good for you, kid.  Don't say anything.  I think, uh, I think the kid's a little intimidated.  You're a little intimidated, are you?  With the bright lights and then...  Yeah.  Scared.  Oh, my God.  I'll be afraid.  I'll be on the other one.  There we go.  Okay.  All right.  Wow.  Look at that. 
[00:52:00]  Look at him go.  Look at him go.  Me and the kid are making eye contact.  That's really disturbing.  I hear you, fella.  Look at him go.  He's a hungry little fella.  Okay.  Hey, what's up?  How are you, kid?  Look at him getting a little grip.  He's going to town.  Oh, my God.  Look at that suspicious look on his face.  Oh, yeah.  He's got a...  All right.  Look.  This is...  All right.  This is not right.  It is, Opie.  No, I finally found my line.  This is so blushy, blushy, beet red, Opie. 
[00:52:30]  You know what the worst part is?  The kid is looking around the room.  I want to go for the other one, but it would probably...  He'll snap at you.  Look at him.  Look, she's...  Oh, my God.  Stop looking at me.  All right.  Tell the kid to stop looking at me.  Check.  Check.  He hasn't eaten since this morning.  Check, please.  Does he eat anything else?  Oh, absolutely.  What does he eat?  What kind of food does he like?  Macaroni.  What do you like?  He likes waffles.  He likes french fries. 
[00:53:00]  Foss is here.  Oh.  It's not bad.  It's not bad.  Watch the kid make eye contact.  That's the best part.  He looks at you like, don't even think about it, pal.  Do you always use your right utter?  Or do you ever use your right utter?  He'll tell me when this one's empty.  He'll say, other ninny mama.  And how long can one of those last, let's say?  I say you could empty a breast in about 20 minutes.  It depends on who, you know, if it's an infant or a toddler doing the suckers. 
[00:53:30]  Steve, how weird is this?  There's Heinz milk.  This is radio.  There's four milk.  And we can't describe it, but how weird is this?  Weirder than anything I have ever seen.  It's so natural.  Oh, my God.  It's so natural.  Yeah?  Definitely.  How long do you think you're going to do that until Dyfus knocks on your door?  Dyfus can't knock on my door because this is totally within the realm of normalcy.  I don't have a trill.  I probably have a house bigger than yours.  It's a big, you're big S-ing.  Yeah, let the, uh... 
[00:54:00]  Hey, go S yourself.  Who is this frigging character?  Get him out of here.  I'm leaving.  Boss.  Don't disrespect me, you animal.  Boss.  Yeah, you animal.  Hey, boss.  What's your boss?  Hey, you're sorry.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  I don't live in a trill.  I don't respect him.  I'm sorry.  You know something?  I was as freaked out.  I was as freaked out as you about breastfeeding.  Yeah.  I was.  I swear to God.  The first time I saw him.  Now, look what you're doing to my son.  You're making him scared.  Oh, my God.  I'm making your son scared.  I'm sorry.  You're giving him the wrong message.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  The wrong message.  I have the other side.  Oh, my God.  You're scaring him.  Tell Damien to relax.  Everything's cool.  Oh, my God.  Come with me, Mark.  Don't make me beg you.  I'm giving wrong messages.  You're saying that your ass isn't fat.  That's a wrong message.  I totally admit my ass is fat.  But look at you.  I mean, what, do you weigh 90 pounds?  That's all the crap he uses to smoke.  No.  He's thinking of virus.  He's thinking of facial hair.  And why do you have two earrings?  Are you a faggot? 
[00:55:00]  Oh, wow.  Let me tell you something about Rich Voss over here.  You know how he treats his kids?  One of them he owes money to, and he's dodging.  And he's dodging.  And he just comes up here because the dryer door broke, and he sells them.  Yeah.  Bastard.  So don't even try.  No fighting, please.  No fighting.  Don't scare the child.  Don't scare him.  Don't scare him.  It is normal.  Yeah, don't scare him.  Don't scare the kid.  Trust me.  You know what's frightening, Opie?  You have your own preconceived notion of fear that you're afraid of.  You know the little kid hand with the little indented knuckles? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  You ever see, it's like, look right over there.  It's the little kid hand with the indented knuckles, because they haven't, like, popped  out yet.  To see one of those just grabbing onto one of those huge cans.  This kid's got a pinky ring.  I got one question.  Wait, I want to hear Andrew talk.  Andrew, how you doing, man?  Do you like Bob the Builder?  Say yes.  He's nodding.  Don't answer.  Say the kid nibbles on your butt.  Does he get a hamburger?  Don't be ridiculous.  You're acting like a moron.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:56:00]  He hears that every time he goes on stage.  You're acting like a moron.  You mean you're a professional comic?  No.  Don't quit your day job.  Oh.  Don't quit my day job.  How much fluid does this child need?  Now he's got Gatorade.  Well, he's got to watch down that stench.  Am I allowed to kick this guy in the...  Oh, yeah.  In his little Jewish bag?  Yes.  There's not one guy in here that'll defend him.  I guess you have to like Gatorade, because it would be awful if he's playing Little League  and you're sitting there and he wants a little drink. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  When they're potty trained, they usually wean Norton.  And another thing I wanted to say about the breastfeeding.  It's as beneficial to the mother as it is to the child.  I bet.  How so?  How so?  How so?  I hear you could lose a lot of weight doing that.  Oh, you...  Well...  No, no.  Someone called in the show and said that.  You did.  Well, you drop a lot of natural weight after you have the baby.  How is it beneficial to the mother?  That I want to know.  Well, at first, it shrinks the uterus back to size. 
[00:57:00]  All the contract...  It makes everything tighter.  A good punch.  It prevents breast cancer.  A working breast is a good breast.  The shrinks the uterus?  They do have three.  Listen, will you stop saying I'm fat?  Norton already said I was.  Jesus, boss.  You're big boned.  I'm not big boned either.  I'm just...  I am 38, 28, 38.  I'm a full-figured woman.  I'm a size 10-12.  What do you want?  You want to check my pants size?  What do you like skinned in, too?  What do you wipe your ass with? 
[00:57:30]  The couch?  Listen to me.  Oh, God.  Boss.  Boss.  I'm only killing...  Hey, Anthony.  Shy him in here.  We're trying.  I am...  I'm still stupefied.  I'll be speechless.  Well, we're all scared of boss when he comes in here.  We don't know how to handle him.  Is he the man?  He's mean.  He's a very mean guy.  Maybe he needs to breastfeed.  What's his name?  Andrew?  I love you, Daniel.  I dare you.  Now, when the kid is breastfeeding and he looks up at your mustache,  does he think it's a guy?  Or what does he...  No.  He doesn't think it's a guy. 
[00:58:00]  Rich!  That is...  Why are you being rude to our guest?  She's a lovely lady.  She's really nice to all of you.  And she's sharing with us and our audience.  She knows I'm kidding, right?  I don't know you from Adam.  I don't know about that either.  That's okay.  You can have your opinion, but I would say the majority...  I don't think the mustache is that bad.  No, it's not.  Hey, I'm Italian like Anthony.  Exactly.  We all like Italian girls.  You know, that's the reason.  So, now, how long have you been going with this?  So, how old? 
[00:58:30]  It's called child-led weaner.  Hey, a lot of...  Mom there?  A lot of people want to know what happened to the husband.  Oh, that's a good question.  Nothing.  What do you mean?  Oh, you're still married and...  I'm married.  Oh, okay.  I wasn't sure.  Interesting.  You know, is daddy still around and all that?  Absolutely.  Where's he?  Right now, he's working in Boston.  He's a network engineer.  Oh, yeah?  Like Pete Johnson.  He's a very good provider.  It is Pete Johnson.  Oh, no.  Hey, does Andrew want to say something? 
[00:59:00]  Is he feeling a little more comfortable?  Andrew, what are you drinking there?  It's Gatorade.  He's a thirsty kid.  What you got?  What do you got there?  What's that stuff?  Huh?  He does this for the thirst.  The other one is just for the fun.  Do you like a lot of his friends come over to play and say, can we have milk?  Do they try to do that?  No.  Come in, Michael.  Michael, come in.  That's true, too.  How old is he?  You know, you're an awful, awful man. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  Hey, could the kid do it one more time there before we move on?  Yeah.  One more time.  He doesn't want any more.  I think he wants more.  Watch.  Hang on.  Oh, he doesn't want more.  Oh, he can't see me behind that computer.  I can see.  I can see.  He doesn't want more?  No, the kid wants more.  He doesn't want to be empty.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  No, it's not empty.  She goes, I think it's empty.  The kid shakes his head.  No, no.  Ah!  Tough! 
[01:00:00]  Get a good one.  He's got a good one.  All right.  You guys are great.  Opie, Anthony, you are far ahead of your chomp tissue.  Oh, really?  Yeah, about six months ago, but it didn't get very far.  Nobody wanted to touch it.  Well, you know.  Well, then again, he's only four.  He doesn't know any better.  Hey, uh...  But I commend you guys for doing a good public service.  I want to apologize for his boss.  No problem.  We don't know where he comes up with his stuff. 
[01:00:30]  It's not like we knew he was going to, like, attack you and stuff.  We thought he would come in and, you know, just promote one of his stupid shows again.  But he's reacting very typically of anyone who sees a toddler breastfeeding.  Look what you do.  Hey, look.  Now the kid has a mustache, too.  Steve checking in.  Even after clearing out both breasts, the kid will still have sucked less than Voss ever did.  Oh, wow. 
[01:01:00]  Is that true?  What?  Bravo.  So we can't get the kid to say anything, huh?  I don't know.  He's eating right now.  Yeah, I see.  Yeah, but I get him to...  Do you want to talk?  Yeah, but I get him to talk.  Oh, he's shaking his head no.  Of course he doesn't.  Would you want to with a mouthful of that?  I wouldn't either.  Does it have to smother his whole face?  Well, I'm sorry.  My breasts are large.  Usually, just a word about positioning.  Anytime you breastfeed a child, the correct position is stomach to stomach.  The baby's stomach for not sore breasts should be... 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, but...  So then why is the kid standing?  How about the 11-year-old?  The baby, yes.  So they usually...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's wrong positioning.  Slow down.  You can't say that?  Slow down.  No, don't even test him.  Is sweater vest Jake Baker going to dump out of that?  That's okay.  What happens when he finally gets a beer belly?  Yeah.  Is it harder to get the belly-to-belly action there?  He'll quit by then.  Oh, really?  What could I...  This time next year, he's...  He seems like he's really enjoying that, though. 
[01:02:00]  He hasn't eaten since this morning.  You guys made me starve him for this demonstration.  What if he doesn't want to stop, though?  What if he doesn't want to stop?  He will stop when the breasts are empty.  No, no, no.  What happens when he's going to stop in a year, I'm saying?  When do you eventually put your foot down and go, enough?  When I feel my child is comfortable.  When she puts her foot down and steps on her own breast.  Hey, he's done!  Hey!  Lucky devil.  Hey, Andrew, how you doing?  See how he just pushed his mom aside?  I'm done with you.  Get out.  I'm done with you.  I'm done with you. 
[01:02:30]  He's just using me for my breasts.  Yeah.  Does he ever try to reach down and diddle that cave?  That dark, depressing...  Oh, my God!  That is such a ridiculous question.  Oh, my God!  I'm not going to dignify it with an answer.  Vos, what's wrong with you?  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  What do you think?  You're on the death comedy jam again?  Breastfeeding is not a sensual act at all.  I hope you're not going to use that joke on stage, because that's stunk.  Okay.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  That's great.  You're actually on stage. 
[01:03:00]  Where are you on stage next?  I don't know.  It's probably like Friday and Lindhurst at the group, but I don't know.  Okay.  I might have to check out that act.  Yeah, check it out.  You know what?  Stop stuttering.  Stop staring at my breath.  You, me?  I'm not staring at me.  You know what?  This is not sexual, Rich.  Yeah, we're learning about this thing.  Hey, you should go to the comedy club with Andrew and be like the female Otto and George.  He's in bed by night.  You can just work them and... 
[01:03:30]  All right.  Cool.  Anthony, do you have kids?  Give me another one of those milk barrels there, lady.  Well, I hope all you guys...  No, no kids.  ...you have wives and get kids that you will encourage...  ...and support your children to breastfeed.  Never.  I'm asking you something, and this is serious, because they're pretty big.  Aren't you scared that your son's going to get stretch marks around his mouth if he does this too long?  No.  Next dumb question.  Yeah, boss.  They'll all come out of boss.  Don't look anywhere else for the dumb questions.  Don't you have one serious question to ask, lady? 
[01:04:00]  At least I was really impressed Friday, Anthony.  I really was, because you weren't prepared for this.  Nobody really briefed you on it.  Well, of course not.  You act at some really critical...  You should go into journalism.  We fly by the seat of our pants here.  You have some serious investigative skills.  Oh, of course.  You shouldn't go into journalism.  No, we shouldn't.  He has a critical mind.  We like to call him Mike Wallace.  That's what I am.  I'm the Mike Wallace of the Opinion of the show.  Of porno radio.  Well, you know what?  He's the tip of the iceberg. 
[01:04:30]  Now, if a kid licks a little balloon knot, and then he does it, he has a chocolate hook, right?  Oh, boss.  Boss.  No, you do suck.  I told that joke in third grade.  God damn, boss.  How old are you?  I told that joke when I was still breastfeeding from my mind.  Oh, he's a carrot tussle.  Wait, what is it?  He's a cute kid.  He needs more?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He's on the other side, Anthony.  Quick, someone get my shopping bag.  You're just tuning in. 
[01:05:00]  We have a kid pushing for nourishing off his mom.  I'm sorry.  I don't have implants.  They're real breasts.  No doctor would smell it that bad.  Boss.  That would have been great if he didn't use the N-word.  They had to dump out of that.  Yeah.  Really?  There you go.  I can't say it.  I can't say it.  No, I can't say it.  So why would you say it if you...  Well, actually, in some context, and probably that one you can.  Hopefully. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  You could just say it, but you can't put anything before it or after it, so let's just not say it.  That's what old goody gumdrops got.  That's right.  All right.  And your husband, he's cool with this.  He doesn't mind?  He's totally supportive, and I thank him.  How old are your other kids?  Are they older?  Eight and ten, yes.  And I have a picture of them.  Don't try to be nice now.  One of her kids, if I remember correctly, well into his fours.  He's eight and ten.  No, but he was doing this... 
[01:06:00]  They both were.  They both quit at 4.2 years, almost like clockwork.  They put it in their act, too, which is really disgusting.  It's amazing.  Hey, I've been clean for six years.  If you allow...  If you give a child unlimited access to your breast and allow him to tell you when he's finished breastfeeding,  that will occur around the time of potty training and...  Why isn't the kid potty trained?  Well, because I don't push it.  You know, I'm not a mother that goes into the office, although I did have a career broadcasting.  No, it's not called Lazy. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, it seems to be a potty trainer.  Mom, I'm at the office.  I just crapped myself and I'm hungry.  Still not potty trained.  But I got that promotion.  I'm head of sales now.  Does this have anything to do with, like, almost like if he is potty trained and if he is on his own,  then all of a sudden there's a mother, you feel like you have no purpose if you're not serving him?  Well, I don't know.  That didn't happen yet because right after I quit breastfeeding, I got pregnant again.  So I am going...  Ah, see.  In about a year, Norton, when I stop lactating after 11 years, I'm probably going to need your help. 
[01:07:00]  But you're going to want to have another baby.  No, but Norton understands the psychological disposition of a mother who has been lactating.  So I'm saying, is it in a way...  I'm not saying it's wrong, but is it self-serving to allow him to breastfeed so long?  Because it's almost like my role is done as a mother.  Right.  It seems like you want to extend your role as a mother of a child.  No, to make him depend.  Listen to me.  I have not had a good night's sleep in 12 years.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah, but there could be something in you that enjoys that. 
[01:07:30]  Absolutely not.  Is there, like, a breeze through the barn?  I mean, why can't you get sleep?  Because the baby nurse is during the evening.  It's interrupted.  Yes.  It's a line outside her door at night.  Especially at a very young age, any breastfeeding mother will tell you they nurse throughout the evening.  Yeah.  I do it as a labor of love.  I know after four years, the world's going to eat them alive anyway.  So if I can give my kids four years of their lives, 100% attention, I'll do that.  It's a bad example, but it's almost like staying married to a guy who drinks.  I'm not saying it's the same thing, but it's almost like, well, that's my purpose is to rescue him. 
[01:08:00]  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  I'm just asking.  I don't know.  I'm not a mother.  Sometimes you've got to not be selfish.  You have to be sacrificial.  And then every dog has his day, and I'll get my day.  Adam from Seven Island writes pink lipstick, too.  This woman should be shot.  Nambler would treat the kid better than this woman.  She's nice to her, kid.  Women, I get a lot more resistance and violence from women about the breastfeeding than I do from men.  So does Norton.  All that mace and taser shots.  Is the kid still going? 
[01:08:30]  Do you do this in public, too, on the bus?  I do it anywhere the baby wants to nurse.  It's not a baby.  That I disagree with.  The kid talks.  That I disagree with.  He is a baby.  To me, he is a baby.  Don't you feel that's a bit overindulgent, though, like wherever he wants, regardless of how anybody else feels about it?  If I'm eating, I don't want to watch that.  You're not going to see it.  I'm so discreet.  Can you notice that I'm breastfeeding the baby right now?  Yes.  Regardless.  Absolutely.  I mean, if you're looking for it, you know what I'm doing.  But if you were in a mall sitting, you would think I'm just holding the child. 
[01:09:00]  So the kid leans over, looks at you, and winks.  They think we're just friends, don't they?  It's just a matter of conditioning people to think differently about the breast.  All right.  That's what we do on a daily basis.  Yeah.  All right.  I would have to say.  Wrap around your mule.  I would have to say, as weird as this is to us, even though we're learning today,  Anthony.  Yes.  She's in the lead for the trip to L.A.  Yes.  Errol Smith.  There you go.  Because when are you ever going to see that? 
[01:09:30]  Little lad.  Little lad.  You guys are great.  Shopping bag.  Although you do have to fly over on a cargo plane.  Don't quit your J-job.  I said it again.  Isn't that awful?  She openly admitted that she was fat.  Rich is not fat.  Really?  Then why are you saying that?  I am fat.  I am fat.  You're not fat.  I'm not saying I'm fat.  She's all right.  But, I mean, from the forehead up, you're not bad.  Oh, I am pretty.  Thank you.  I am pretty.  Oh, no.  Oh, Angela.  Don't talk that way about yourself. 
[01:10:00]  You're not fat.  I hate when you say, get on the ride, you fat pig.  Is he going to shoot me, throw my body in the river?  Do you know how you sound?  You're not dying.  You're killing everyone around you.  I want to know how Stinky's doing after Friday.  Awesome Garrett.  Stinky.  Awesome Garrett.  How are you doing?  What did you think of the breastfeeding mom there?  Yeah, I know it got all over your face and everything.  You're so close to me.  Are you okay?  I hate her.  She's so annoying.  I hate her.  She's not awesome at all.  No?  Awesome Garrett is not dubbing you as awesome.  Wait, what's wrong, Awesome Garrett? 
[01:10:30]  She brings her kid in and uses him to win a trip to Aerosmith.  Are you making an allegation, Stinky Garrett Awesome Man?  It's not why I'm here, really.  I'm here because these two nice guys, Open Anthony, are so friggin' progressive about  their radio talk show.  Right, see?  They're on the avant-garde edge of this scene.  She just happens to have her child with her.  They're totally cool.  And I am a definite fan from here on in.  You're awesome Garrett. 
[01:11:00]  What's wrong?  If this is so natural, why is it the strangest thing you could bring in then?  Because to you, to blend hands like you.  Awesome question.  It was an awesome question, but I'm sure you have an awesome answer.  I like the awesomeness of that question.  That was an awesome question.  Because I really want to sensitize everybody's sensibilities about breastfeeding.  That it is, the breast is both a natural and sexual object.  Awesome answer.  Say something, Andrew.  To an awesome question.  A.G. in the house.  So then you're not going to mind if you don't win the trip. 
[01:11:30]  Not at all.  Like you did on Friday when you were complaining to us for a half hour after the show.  What I was mad about was that, this lame little...  That little bird spleen was more impressive than my brain.  Yeah, it kind of was, though.  Why didn't you send her to Somalia so she could breastfeed that country with those big things?  It made me really sick to watch.  Why don't we move on with the show?  Because that was wonderful.  All right.  Well, little Andrew, thank you so much.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Can we get Andrew and say goodbye?  Say bye.  Bye-bye. 
[01:12:00]  Say hi, Daddy.  Say bye-bye.  How about a fresco?  Hey, how about a fresco?  He's smiling.  He's going to get a lot of girls.  Of course he's smiling.  He has good skin.  Breastfeeding is good for good skin or no?  You should see my older son, Rocco.  Well, I'm free.  Hey, I'm breastfeeding.  What's going on?  You ever see a blonde hair, blue-eyed Rocco?  You bet I have.  Rocco Man from Poland.  All right.  Hey, I have a question.  I want Andrew to say something. 
[01:12:30]  I know.  He's got to say something.  Come on, Andrew.  Andrew, just say bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Say bye-bye.  You've got to say bye-bye.  Would you tell him about what we did today?  No.  No.  And now he wants Nini.  Well, Jesus.  No more Nini.  No more Nini.  We've seen enough Nini.  That's healthy emotionally.  Do you want to play Anthony's pinball machine?  You want to play?  Do you like his pinball?  Do you like that?  You like the machine?  Do you want to play it again?  Say thank you for letting me play. 
[01:13:00]  Tell him.  Go ahead.  That's him.  He's freaked out by Norton.  Why?  Why isn't he?  Oh, look at him.  It's instinctive in young children now.  All right.  How about a little...  Why don't you talk to Anthony wearing Robert Loge's shirt from Scarface?  The kid has a better...  I should kill him.  He hasn't gotten a bass in all year.  The kid's laughing.  It's a lovely spring day.  He gets all your jobs.  I'm wearing my light spring-type shirt.  That looks like his office mural. 
[01:13:30]  You know, it would have been more effective if you were wearing anything but a 1982 Ozzy Osbourne concert t-shirt.  Right.  Ozzy.  The kid likes Ozzy.  Look at his smile on the young man's face.  He knows.  Yeah.  British and good in the ratings.  No, he's just looking at your breasts.  He wants to breastfeed with you.  That really bothers me, you John Turturro-looking zilch.  I just have one more question. 
[01:14:00]  Uh-oh.  That was 20 minutes.  Here we go.  No, it's not 20.  It's...  Is someone going to pay for my parking?  Just do that show for the parking guys.  They'll love it.  Seriously.  I came all the way out here.  Give the attendant a beverage and...  You guys are cold.  A little squirt.  Come on, if I don't win the chick.  All right.  We'll go down to eat at your trough.  We'll see what we can come up with.  All right.  We'll see what we can come up with.  There he goes.  Bye-bye. 
[01:14:30]  He hates me.  Thank you, Andrew.  Bye-bye.  He's a cool kid.  There he goes.  Bravo.  Billy got the kid.  With her hat on.  Now the kid's going to...  You know, man, I got to say it.  We've seen some crazy things in, I don't know, doing this show.  That is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.  Me and the kid were making eye contact.  It was really weird.  He's looking at me.  Yeah, his eyes are going all over the place.  Like, he's looking around.  Who's watching me?  It's like, hey.  He knows it's...  I think the kid knows it's weird by, you know, by how he was looking around the room. 
[01:15:00]  Well, the thing is that, like, you know, I'm looking at him.  He's looking at me.  And the breast is going, what do you want from me?  Looks familiar.  Well, why don't we take a break here.  I don't know if you don't notice, but I don't breastfeed no more.  The guy with the pickled punk will be on the show next.  Right.  Pickled punk.  If that wasn't enough, next, dead baby in a jar. 
[01:15:30]  And thought so's it money.  And he's dodging it.  And it's all for a trip to L.A. to see Aerosmith on MTV Icon this weekend.  I owe my kids six bucks for formaldehyde.  You got two hours to get down here with your strangest thing that you can show us to try to win that trip to L.A., all right?  More with the gang in just a bit.  I love Snatch.  Bring on the horse. 
[01:16:00]  The O.D. and Anthony Show.  Oh, you filthy crazy.  Ha-ha!  We're back with the O.D. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  Including Sacramento, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm hearing things.  I'm hearing that they finally got WOW stickers out in Sacramento.  Bravo.  And they're going to be dishing them out like crazy.  Tomorrow, the official kickoff of WOW. 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  Which means get your WOW on your car for tomorrow's festivities.  Yep.  You'll have a very good chance of seeing moms breastfeeding their kids on the way home from...  No, no.  You know, girls might flash on the way home from work tomorrow.  But you need the WOW on your car to participate, all right?  Absolutely.  WOW is finally back, my friend.  Anyway, if you're in Sacramento or anywhere else outside of New York, you can use this number.  866-277-4WOW.  Ha-ha! 
[01:17:00]  Ah, Rocco checking in, Anthony.  Hey, tools, you don't make fun of the family.  What are you talking about, Rocco?  You had my mother in, I heard it.  Oh, the breastfeeding mom.  Yeah, that's right.  She was just breastfeeding a kid that's pushing for...  Yeah, that's my brother.  Shut up.  I know already.  Hey, happy take-em-out Tuesday.  It's a new bit I just came up with.  Wow, that's brilliant, Rocco.  What do you think of that?  Very brilliant.  Hey, next week we're going to do Bring Down Oddities to the Station.  Oddities? 
[01:17:30]  That's very similar to what we're doing today.  No, no, it's not.  Yes, it is.  Shut up.  It is not.  Yes, it is.  And we have a trip to MTV's Icon.  You do?  Yeah, I just stole the tickets from Dave's office.  Don't tell him, man.  I think he's going to split out of here early.  We might have some, you know, lesbians or gay guys in or something.  I don't know.  Smack some man-ass.  Maybe we'll have some beers.  All right, sounds fun, Rocco.  I know.  All right, well, thanks for checking in. 
[01:18:00]  Hey, thanks for having me on.  I mean, you guys suck.  All right.  Later.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, we're going to have some that chick.  Yeah, she's going to breastfeed her kid on my show.  And there's nothing anyone can do about it because I...  What?  Oh, Dave says no.  All right, forget it.  I'll just whip some man-ass instead.  I'm good at that.  Because Dave says that's okay to do.  Where's Lil' Rocco? 
[01:18:30]  Hey, we got to say hi to Bill Kennison, man.  We made him wait through that whole mess.  Uh, Mr. Kennison?  Yes, sir.  Hey, Bill, what's up, man?  Sam's brother, obviously.  I'm assuming everyone knows that.  Hey, Bill, were you listening to the lady breastfeed a kid that's pushing four?  Yeah, I was making some notes here.  I can say goddamn, but not nipple, right?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  No, actually, you could probably get away with it like that.  Yeah.  In that context.  Yeah, the rules are a little silly.  Yeah, they're ridiculous.  A couple things I disagreed with, Ron.  First, I disagree that it's not a sexual act. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  And I do prefer the belly-to-belly when I am breastfeeding.  Do you?  Yes, I do.  It's kind of hard any other way.  Well, when you're small as I am, it is.  You can't do back-to-belly unless you do a back-bend thing.  I don't know.  It was a little weird.  You guys sound great.  Why come you're not out here in L.A.?  Yeah, we're working on it.  Yeah, we're working on it, all right.  Believe me.  It's all wrapped up out there.  Oh, man, the afternoons is crap out here.  Well, no, we're not on in L.A., because they have Tom Lick-Ass out there.  Tom Lick-Ass.  And people seem to like the Lick-Ass better than the ONA show so far. 
[01:19:30]  Unbelievable.  Well, we'll try to change people's minds in the near future.  Yeah, that's right, man.  Hey, Bill, do you still see Carl LeBeau out there?  Yeah.  Actually, I just talked to him Friday night.  You'll notice, I ask questions, and then I have no follow-up.  You know what?  He's name-dropping.  He does that.  Carl's very funny.  He's one of the funniest guys.  Yeah, Carl is a very, very funny guy, and we still stay in touch.  We're good friends.  Yeah.  Just talked to him for, God, I guess probably an hour and a half Friday night. 
[01:20:00]  He was down at San Diego performing.  Listen to that voice, man.  Isn't it sound very much like Sam's voice?  Speaking of Sam's old crew, we had Jimmy Schubert on the air about a month ago.  Jimmy's doing good.  He killed for us.  We've got to get him back on, matter of fact.  He is doing good.  He's a good guy.  So what's going on with Sam?  They're doing a tribute to Sam Kinison on what, Playboy?  Yeah, on Playboy.  Actually, it's the first time that they've ever dedicated in honor of a famous performer a comedy special. 
[01:20:30]  And so it's on tomorrow night, which is the 10-year anniversary of his death.  10 years.  And it's on at 9 p.m. Eastern time and then again at 12 a.m. Pacific time.  90-minute show.  And you have to subscribe to Playboy to get it.  That's the problem.  I don't get the Playboy.  I don't even get it here at my house.  Our cable company doesn't carry Playboy.  You don't get Playboy?  Not really.  I get every other station known to men. 
[01:21:00]  You should have Playboy.  I don't get the Playboy.  I get it.  You get everything.  Why couldn't they give Sam HBO or something?  Well, we've won the HBO thing quite a bit, man.  Yeah, I know.  I just want a lot of people to see this thing.  What are we going to see in this?  Actually, what you're going to see is a kind of an innovative deal.  It's not a documentary.  It's just to be honest, it's just a collection of his nastiest stuff.  Nice.  Good.  Then they've got, like, Rodney Dangerfield doing some interviews. 
[01:21:30]  I do some interviews.  I don't know what other celebrities that they do.  It's 90 minutes.  And they've categorized.  So instead of, like, sitting and watching a show, you're going to have, like, all of his stuff on sex or all of his stuff on religion or all of his stuff on politics.  You're all categorized.  All right.  So it should be interesting.  I'll be honest with you.  I'm looking forward to getting a copy and looking at it.  Nice little retrospect.  Yeah, definitely.  Can you believe it's been 10 years, Bill? 
[01:22:00]  I don't know if I've ever accepted he's dead.  I live with him every day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if I've ever, you know, subconsciously ever...  You don't think he's doing the Elvis thing, do you?  God, he might be, man.  He loves Hawaii.  Maybe over there serving Mai Tais with Elvis or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He could stay out of the public eye.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on with the kid that pretty much killed him?  Have you heard of anything?  Well, he got...  No, I know the whole deal.  He barely got any time, and then...  He didn't get any time.  Yeah.  We've had you on the show a bunch, and it turned out the kids started bragging to everyone that 
[01:22:30]  he was the one that killed Sam.  Yeah, he wanted him to put...  When they put his picture in his yearbook, because he was 17 in high school, he wanted  him to put underneath his picture that he had killed Sam.  Really?  Yeah.  I figure he and I still got a date somewhere.  I figure I'll run into him somewhere.  Hmm.  A little scumbag.  Oh, what does he do?  I mean, you know where he is?  What he does?  He was from Las Vegas.  Now that he's of age, his name was Troy Pearson.  I hope he just had to become a male hooker.  Hey, we're on Vegas there, Bill.  I hope he just had to become a male hooker and suck on mules. 
[01:23:00]  And just swallow man's seed for years and years.  Troy Pearson, his name was, Bill?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, just a real jerk.  I mean, he was amazing.  You know, and I didn't necessarily want him to, you know, to go to prison, because believe  me, there was a lot of times it could have been the other way around with Sam driving.  Yeah.  And, but the kid had absolutely no remorse.  Yeah, it's like, first of all, yeah, it could have happened the other way, but then he wouldn't  have been killing somebody who would have made us laugh for a few more years. 
[01:23:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, that's true.  It's like, kind of selfish, but the guy took some pretty good comedy.  Yeah, he did.  This kid was pretty much a little white trash, drunken scumbag and just bragged about the  fact.  Well, I'd say that pretty well categorizes him.  Yeah.  And you don't know what he's up to these days?  No, man.  Actually, the attorney that represented him is now a judge out here where I live.  And so I ran into him, I don't know, maybe a year ago, and I asked him, he said,  I never heard from the kid from that day.  I said, you don't even know then if he lived up to what he was sentenced to. 
[01:24:00]  He said, no, I don't.  So no one knows what Troy Pearson from Vegas could be doing?  I have no idea.  We're on in Vegas there.  Oh, yeah.  Perhaps somebody will let us know.  Yeah, maybe he'll call in.  It'd be good to get him and I on a show together.  Hey, any possibility of getting more CDs out there, Bill?  You know, what I want to do is his first CD, which I always, I mean, his first album,  which I always thought was his best, has never been on CD.  We're doing a, we have a movie deal with Universal.  And I think once that we get closer to the movie, then we'll probably get Warner Brothers 
[01:24:30]  to release it on a CD.  But there isn't a whole lot of material left that, you know, we haven't put out there  at one time or another.  Yeah.  Now, who do you want to play Sam in the movie?  We're looking really seriously at Jack Black.  Wow.  All right.  I could definitely see that.  Jack Black, a friend of the show.  Yeah, I could totally see that.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Remember when Sam hosted, when he did SNL? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  And he did the nailing in the crucifix bit?  Yeah.  When they re-showed that, did they edit the nailing in part?  Yeah.  Yeah, they did.  There was two things they didn't want on.  That was the, that was one of them.  They didn't want him nailing Jesus to the NBC cross or stage.  And the other thing was, is he was wanting to make a deal with the government that they  give us back our good pot, they would quit doing coke and everything else.  Really?  And those were the two things that they didn't want him to have on there. 
[01:25:30]  But Sam took about five seconds and considered it and went on and did it anyway and eventually  came back two weeks later and hosted the show after they said he would never be on NBC  again.  And that was a typical Sam.  No problem having another mango skid on.  Yep.  Don't talk about drugs.  But you can do as many as you want if you're on the show.  Yeah.  Great.  That's the way it works.  Yeah.  All right.  All right there, Bill.  We'll be looking out for that on Playboy. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, Playboy tomorrow night, nine o'clock Eastern time and then it'll be re-shown at midnight  I think out here or is it 10 o'clock.  Let me check here.  They gave me all my little notes here.  Yeah, midnight tomorrow night on Pacific Coast time.  You guys are great, man.  Get your, get your butt out of here.  Yeah, we're working on it.  I love listening to you.  We're working on it, Popeye.  And look how progressive you guys are that you would have breastfeeding on your show.  Yeah.  What other radio host was even a temp?  Yeah, exactly.  How crazy are we, Bill? 
[01:26:30]  I was expecting a little more description of what we were looking at.  Oh, we know the rules, my friend.  Oh, okay.  All right.  The kid was four years old.  Yeah, the kid was pushing four and he was looking around the room and he was grabbing,  it was, it was quite a sight there, Bill.  High-fiving.  I got a feeling Anthony, they were trying to figure out, hey, you're going to muscle out this  year-old kid or whatever.  Yeah, you know, I don't have to fling him aside, grab a little beverage.  Hey, Bill, off the subject, for years I've been hearing that Carl LeBow has a huge mule.  Is that the truth? 
[01:27:00]  Let's just say that if I was like Carl, yeah, yeah, I'd be wealthy right now.  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Carl has been a blessed man.  I've heard he's been packing.  For years I've been hearing the rumor that he's really packing.  Yeah, well, it's true.  Thank you, Bill.  I've heard, I've heard, I've never seen the film.  Hey, Bill, we got the phone number of the kid that killed Sam.  Do you really?  Really, how the hell did you come up with that?  Well, I'm not positive, but Rick, call the phone number really fast. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  Hold on, hold on a second, Bill.  Okay.  The least we can do for you.  We'll see.  Rick's going to call it real fast.  We'll see if there's anything to it, all right?  All right.  Really?  Oh, okay.  I got that right there now.  I'm looking at it.  We'll see.  We'll see how this Tommy guy, is he the guy that got the number, or is that a different one?  Tommy?  It looks legit.  See how well he did.  Yeah, well, I was going to say, it looks legit.  Duh.  Hey, Bill, we got some guy outside the studio. 
[01:28:00]  He's bringing in a pickled punk in a few minutes.  You ever see those things?  No, I never have.  Yeah.  You know what a pickled punk is?  Oh, yeah, I've heard of them.  That baby in the jar.  They're hot.  No.  That's right, Sam used to do a routine that he wanted to invent the K-Tales Pocket Pal for the truck drivers.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  What was that?  When you've got to be to Kansas City, and you're horny, and you've got no one around, you get K-Tales Pocket Pal.  But do you know what a pickled punk is?  Oh, I've got a pretty good idea, don't I? 
[01:28:30]  It's a dead baby in a jar.  Yeah.  That's what that looks like.  No, it's a real dead baby in a jar.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  They used to have them on circus side shows.  Yeah, it was...  They come from medical labs and whatnot, and somebody decided to bring that down today.  I'm wondering if we could clip a toe off and have someone eat it.  All right, stop.  What?  A human spleen is one thing?  Yeah.  We had some guy eat a spleen.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Some guy brought in his own spleen that had been removed a week or two prior, and somebody 
[01:29:00]  popped into the microwave and ate it on our show.  Is he still alive?  Yeah, he got real sick.  Yeah, I would imagine.  But I'm thinking, what are the repercussions of eating a fetus toe?  Ugh.  God, man.  That would be pretty handy.  Well, we're waiting for Rick.  I don't know if he's having any luck here.  It looks like he's still calling.  Rick, keep us going.  Yeah.  Anyway, if you get a hold of the kid, I doubt that he's going to come on the air, man.  Really? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  I mean, why would he?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Well, he's pretty ignorant, though.  Maybe he would.  Maybe he wants to, uh...  Clear his name.  Yeah, there you go.  Clear his name.  Clear his conscience.  Yeah, he could be a celebrity in another 15 minutes.  Rick getting an answering machine.  Oh.  Oh, well, Bill.  All right, we'll keep trying there for you, Bill.  All right, guys.  All right.  Hey, have a good one.  You guys sound great.  Oh, thank you, Bill.  When's it special again, Bill?  That's tomorrow night, 9 o'clock Eastern and 12 o'clock Pacific.  All right, cool.  I'm playing, boy.  Thank you.  Okay, buddy.  There you go.  Bill Kinison, everyone. 
[01:30:00]  Hey, buddy.  Comic to you, Sam.  Yeah.  I'm afraid what I believe you do.  It sucks.  All the awful comics.  This little dirt bag has to hit the great ones.  What could have been Emo Phillips?  Oh, please.  Three days in a row.  Thank you.  Three days in a row.  Oh, you mentioned Emo, and they all made sense.  I didn't push too hard in.  All right.  Katie, what's up?  Nothing.  All right.  You're not kidding, are you?  Katie.  Yes.  All right.  You're on with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:30:30]  What's up?  Nothing.  How are you guys doing?  Very good.  How are you?  I'm all right.  So what are you calling for, Katie?  Here you go.  All right.  See, you got to kind of get her into talking.  And where are you calling from?  New Hampshire.  Calling from New Hampshire, Opie.  Yeah.  I'm trying.  Yeah.  So how are you doing?  Good?  I'm doing good.  And you think you're qualified to do the fake OR, are you?  I'm going to try. 
[01:31:00]  Do you sound a little more energetic when you're doing this than you do right now with this phone  call?  Yeah.  Well, right now I'm a little nervous.  All right.  Ah, a little nervous, Opie.  What do you do for a living there, Katie?  Actually, I'm a custodian.  Do you always relax?  Wow, that's a surprise.  Do you always relax into autism when you're nervous?  What?  Are you going to do the orgasm?  Yeah.  Wait, Katie, how old are you?  18.  Oh, boy.  That's okay.  When did your parents realize that you were going to disappoint them?  I don't know. 
[01:31:30]  Are you going to school?  What?  Are you going to school for anything?  Yeah.  For what?  Auto body.  You're...  Auto body.  Okay.  So you're a custodian now, but you're going to school for auto body.  Wow.  Yeah.  Can I ask you a question not to be off color?  How fat are you?  I'm a size three.  Wow.  I apologize.  Apex Tech?  Excuse me?  Are you doing Apex Tech where you get to keep the tools upon your graduation?  I don't know. 
[01:32:00]  Hey, Katie, where did it all go wrong, though?  Seriously.  What?  Where did it all go wrong, like?  What do you mean, where did it all go wrong?  I don't know.  You're probably a little girl thinking, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to win a gold  medal skating.  Maybe I'll be a ballerina in New York City.  Maybe just a knight in shining armor will come by and sweep her off her feet.  I want to be a rock singer.  Then what happened?  When did you realize...  No, I'm not like normal girls.  What do you mean by that?  Well, I don't like the giddy girls, so I'm different. 
[01:32:30]  Are you a lesbian?  Oh, no, definitely not.  You have a lot of brothers?  Nope.  Did an uncle creep in there?  Nope.  Did you have a mullet?  No.  What was your...  Did you have any aspirations growing up?  Yeah.  What did you want to do?  What did I want to do?  Yeah.  I'm sure it was an auto body repair.  Well, I don't know.  I never really knew.  I guess rocks are something.  I don't think people search out to become a custodian.  Right?  Well, that job just kind of fell on me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where do you live, Angel? 
[01:33:00]  Excuse me?  Where do you live, Angel?  Kingston.  Where?  Kingston.  Kingston.  Is that upstate New York?  No, it's New Hampshire.  I'm sorry.  Love you.  All right.  Well, we're not going to get much more out of you there, Katie.  So, uh...  Is Stanford and Son your favorite sitcom?  Excuse me?  Nothing.  What do you look like?  Give us a little description.  I got really long hair.  I'm about 5'1".  All right.  How long is your hair?  Ass length. 
[01:33:30]  What?  Ass length, though.  All right.  First of all, cut the hair up to your shoulders.  No.  I like my long hair.  What color is it?  You're 5'1", though.  You look like Cousin Itch.  I hate when the short girls call their hair down to their butt.  Well, this is as long as it's getting.  Is it all just really, uh...  Like, straight?  Yeah.  Very long bangs?  Nope.  So, what?  You got the really short bangs, everything else is really long?  Well, I don't really have bangs.  If you want to call them really long bangs. 
[01:34:00]  It's just parted in the middle, right?  Yeah.  That's awful.  No, it's...  No, and you can't quite put it like that.  I had to dump out of the program.  You can't say that C-word.  And say it four seconds after my fine line, so at least my line gets through.  No, I'm just messing.  Now...  I'm just messing.  Now, Katie...  I'm not really joking.  I'm joking.  How much do you weigh on your 5'1 frame?  1.05.  1.05.  It's fine.  It's the hair.  Breast is his size? 
[01:34:30]  I'm full big.  Getting too big.  All right.  Katie, cut the hair.  It's not happening.  I don't know about this.  You're picturing yourself you could email?  No.  I might so.  You might so?  You might so you could get her camera?  Well, my camera's broken right now.  Oh.  A camera's broken.  I'm just going to learn how to fix them.  Do you get dates?  Excuse me?  Do you get dates, guys, you know, railing you?  I guess so. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, you go out with some guys there in town?  Well, I haven't in a while, but yeah.  I don't know when you first did it, boss.  I don't know when you first did it.  I don't know when you first did it.  It's the hair.  Get a hold of me.  Maybe I'll set it for you.  All right.  Well, I guess we're ready for the fake hole, Anthony.  All right.  Now, we got a little feel of what Katie's all about.  Okay.  Now, we'll sit back and enjoy the custodian. 
[01:35:30]  You guys are something else.  I know.  I'm sorry.  That's boss.  Yeah, he's awful.  Sam's dead yet.  Why can't it be Sam for that every week?  I've been trying to get him booked in Nevada so hard.  Please, boss, go there for a gig.  All right.  Let's go, Katie.  All right.  Maybe you can get that piercing kid or whatever his name is to drive down Broadway when you're at Caroline's. 
[01:36:00]  Start your engines.  Here's Katie.  Here we go.  Katie, you know how we like it.  It's got to build slowly to a crescendo.  All right.  All right.  Here I go.  Let's listen.  Oh, my God. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, my God. 
[01:37:30]  Did she hang up?  Why?  She hung up.  She punched out?  That was not bad at all, man.  I think she didn't know when to stop, and then she hung up.  Oh, no.  She hung up.  That was pretty damn good for a custodian.  It was sexy.  When she went, oh, oh, right there. 
[01:38:00]  That was hot.  No, I don't like the directions.  I know.  The oh, God thing was okay.  We've gone over the direction thing on this show.  Yeah, we don't like the directions.  I agree with you.  We'll figure it out.  I agree with you, although I didn't feel that was directions.  I felt that was just an affirmation, like, wow, you're doing good.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I like to give directions.  Believe me, I'll give directions.  All right.  Let's say directions.  Yeah.  Okay, that's good.  No, no, no, there.  No, there.  Oh, shut up.  Well, sometimes I...  Oh, back up.  No, not the truck, you idiot.  I don't mind directions, though, because you want to... 
[01:38:30]  I have a...  This is one thing I just want to read real quick.  I just have a question about this.  Yes, yes, Norm.  Maybe somebody knows they can call in.  It says...  Why don't you get the kid that was just breastfeeding to read it?  Or is he doing calculus right now?  A homeless man who angered residents of the Bronx apartment building where he camped out  was seriously burned yesterday by youngsters who splashed him with a flammable liquid  and set him on fire.  And, uh... 
[01:39:00]  Yes?  That was nice.  I just wanted to say, uh, to those young men, good job.  Oh, my God.  You cannot possibly advocate burning the homeless.  I didn't say I advocated, but if someone does it, I say good job.  He camped out, he bugged them in their apartment, and they said, how do we get rid of him?  How about a little fire?  Scarecrow.  A little fire will get rid of the old bum.  Oh, my God.  You're out of your mind.  He angered the residents.  They didn't say he was just walking by and attack. 
[01:39:30]  He angered the residents by camping out.  Jim Norton, I believe you're on your own on this one.  I don't care.  In that Bronx neighborhood, those people work hard to sit around all day and let the government  pay for their housing.  They have the right.  How hard are they working if they have a bum living in their, uh, hallway?  No, they don't.  They had a bum living in their hallway.  They had a little fire on them, and they'll live somewhere else.  They'll live by the water in case that happens again.  All right, George.  Very tired of these horrible fake Os. 
[01:40:00]  We'll try to do better with the fake O thing tomorrow.  We'll do better next time.  But when we get back, we, uh, we say hi to a pickled punk.  Yes.  Can't wait to see this.  Let's come on fire.  And we have a, uh, a black Earl hanging out today.  He hasn't done anything.  We'll, we'll talk to him next, and we got a black Earl song and stuff like that, all right?  Does that mean he's off to a good start?  That he hasn't done anything?  Yeah, he's doing well.  Flaming homeless man.  And it said right here, too. 
[01:40:30]  He was erratic and screaming.  You hear the smell of a homeless guy burning flesh and filth and feces.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't get all liberal on me.  No, I don't hate all.  Who are you pissed off with today that you have to do?  Nobody, nope, nobody, nobody.  It was just the idea that the nerve of him to camp out, and they probably were asking him,  look, you got to go, you got to go.  And then a couple of youths, people say the young people are lazy. 
[01:41:00]  No, they're not.  They took a little pride in their neighborhood, and they set the bum on fire.  Go getters.  Yeah.  Hey, he's not going to be camping out here.  Hey, Mr. Lazy, have a little fire on your back.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And we had a lot of fun working with you.  You are on your own.  It was an incredible wild laugh.  I didn't do it.  I'm not saying I did it.  I'm just saying, good job.  You always call young people lazy.  Also, we haven't played today's Wesley Willis song. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, no, I love this guy.  We'll do that when we get back.  Lots to get to, and right now it's the F.U. Line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opie and Anthony F.U. Line.  I want to send out a big F.U. to KJCE in Austin, Texas for taking off the Opie and Anthony show.  They can't suck.  They can't kiss my left.  I hope they don't die on fire with a bunch of f***ing pussies.  Next message.  This is Luke from Copic, and I'd like to send that big F.U. to my fiancee, Victoria, who's the biggest pain in my ass. 
[01:42:00]  She always calls the firehouse, makes me look embarrassed all the time, tells me what to do, doesn't work, doesn't pay no bills, always asks me to do things for her.  You know what, Vicky?  F*** you.  I'm sick of your crap.  Get the hell out of my house.  Stay out.  Put your slippers on.  Go clean your trailer.  You haul.  Next message.  I'd like to send a big F.U. out to the stupid mother f***er who broke into my car Tuesday night. 
[01:42:30]  Dumb f***ing ass f***er who couldn't break into my car like a normal peep  and just break the window.  He had to rip the whole f***ing door handle out.  Now I have to go to the portal body shop and have it fixed.  And the dumb motherf***er didn't even take my radio.  What is he, a f***ing chicken?  Someone scared him away?  F.U. mother f***er.  I hope you f***ing die in hell.  End of message.  Dazzle Opie and Anthony with your brilliance now.  In New York, call 877-692-1027. 
[01:43:00]  Nationally, 866-277-4-WOW.  Opie and Anthony.  And Anthony.  W.  Yeah, we're back with the O&A show.  Katie calling back.  Katie, what's up?  Where do you find these websites?  Look at them.  They're all like Catholic school uniforms.  Thank you, Anthony.  Katie.  Yeah.  What happened to you, man?  You were doing the fake orgasm from Kingston, New Hampshire. 
[01:43:30]  And out of nowhere, you hung up on us.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.  My cheek pressed against the phone.  I'm on a cell phone.  Oh.  Well, you did a very good job.  Yeah.  Well, thank you.  All right.  I would have done better, but I was too nervous.  No, you did fine.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks for helping us out today.  No problem.  Anytime.  By the way, I'm hearing some disturbing news from outside the studio, Anthony.  Yeah, what the hell happened out there?  And it's been confirmed by a few of the people running around here.  While Katie from New Hampshire was doing today's fake orgasm, the breastfeeding mom, 
[01:44:00]  well, let's bring her in here.  Yeah, bring her in and ask her something.  I'm sorry that we've got to bring her back on the show, but this is a little too twisted  and we can't let it just pass by.  Oh, that's good.  She's talking to the kid that's pushing for that she was feeding earlier.  Oh, it's Stalker Paddy.  Hey, is Andrew ready to say hi yet?  Yeah, he was talking out there.  Hey, Andrew.  How you doing?  Hey, Andrew.  What's up?  Hi.  You want to sit down? 
[01:44:30]  I think he does.  I like this kid.  He won't perform on cue.  No.  All right.  Listen.  Good for you, kid.  Don't talk until you want to talk.  Hey, Mom.  Good for you.  Good for you, Spider.  Don't worry.  What were you doing when Katie was doing the fake orgasm?  You were doing that to your kids?  Uh-huh.  No, I was faking mine.  Look at the kids laughing.  What?  You were what?  I was faking mine, too.  That was a good one, actually.  But you were doing it to the kid.  The kid was playing foosball.  Everyone is saying you were doing it right to the kid. 
[01:45:00]  Stop it.  You're like a hippie mom.  What's wrong with you?  That's what they're saying.  Who is they?  Bring them in here.  Who is they?  They were in the sock closet.  Who are these?  There's like 50 people out there.  We're sitting around in a living room situation.  All right.  Look.  Look.  Look.  Look.  This is Jeremy.  Does he look like the type of guy that would lie?  Yeah.  Nice to meet you.  All right, Jeremy.  Thank you, Jeremy.  What did you see when you walked down the hall?  You were doing your sounds.  Thank you.  And you're doing it right now with a kid on a lap. 
[01:45:30]  Your son was standing with his hands up on your knees, staring at you with big, wide eyes.  Exactly.  I sounded pretty damn freaky, didn't I?  Oh.  Why are you moaning to the kid?  Why are you moaning to the kid?  I was reacting to what was on the radio.  Come on, Anthony.  Let me hear it.  How do you sound when you're at that peak?  Jesus.  I'll tell you how.  Come on, Norton.  Ow.  Would you have a sound of teeth falling out? 
[01:46:00]  Come on, Opie.  All right.  Let's do this.  All right.  We got to move on.  We got to move on with the show because we got to do this.  There are lots of people waiting on us.  I'm going to head out now.  When's the last time you saw a man have an orgasm?  Hey, thank you.  All right.  1972.  And you fell off a garbage can?  Yeah, right, right.  Pull the shades down?  All right.  Bye-bye, little Andrew.  Bye, little guy.  There you go.  L-apos-t-e-I-L.  Little. 
[01:46:30]  Opinions on breastfeeding knowledge.  All right.  Well, we've heard enough about the breast.  You can just go to the web and find out everything.  Hey, who's driving?  Thank you.  Thank you.  You did a great job today.  Okay.  Thank you.  There she goes.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  With the little guy.  There she goes.  North America.  Totally nil.  All right, Anthony, the contest is going to start getting very interesting.  You want to tell people real fast what we're doing because we got, I think, three people standing by.  Well, another trip to L.A. to go see Aerosmith for MTV's Icons. 
[01:47:00]  And, well, we did it in Boston on Friday.  You bring down the weirdest thing.  Whatever's strange.  No, I'm not going to kill you.  Whatever.  No.  What?  What did she want?  It's not all about you.  Jesus.  So, yeah.  It's like someone didn't have attention when they were growing up.  Yeah.  It's like someone didn't get to breastfeed when they were growing up.  They're still not getting it.  Hey, Steve, are you bringing that shirt down for the L.A. trip?  Nothing.  Bad joke.  Move right along.  No.  No, really. 
[01:47:30]  No, really, Jim.  Visual jokes always work.  You're right.  I apologize.  My fault.  Keep going, Ed.  Hubla, hubla.  Boy, that really sucked.  1940 humor.  Hey, who bought you that sweater?  I stink.  So we're asking people to bring down odd things, objects, something they have laying around the house,  something on their own body, perhaps, that'll just freak us out.  That woman, for example, brought her a little three-year-old, pushing four, who's still breastfeeds.  Yes.  And demonstrated the whole procedure. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  In very disturbing fashion.  Oh, yeah.  And now I hear we have a pickled punk.  Yep.  And I'm getting word of something else.  Yeah.  Just let's keep it at that.  That's all I'm saying.  We'll have the doctor explain in a few minutes.  Yeah.  But the word I was getting, and I will state this, and I will not back away from this.  I am not looking.  Really?  I will not look at this.  Man, you're weird.  No.  You're weird when it comes to stuff. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Woo!  I'm a crazy man.  Wait till you hear this, people, because I like sideshow stuff like this.  No, this isn't sideshow stuff.  I can't get enough of this stuff.  I'm like, bring on the pickled punk.  I'm fine with that.  All right, all right, all right.  But the things I'm getting the wind of decide if I'm weird or if you're overreacting.  That's all.  Overreacting.  I think you're overreacting.  Yeah, that's it.  It's not every day you get to see something like that, Anthony.  What?  And it's because no one wants to.  Jim, you're not smoking yet, right?  No.  Okay.  Okay, good.  You'll never smoke again, just in case, like, you were thinking maybe. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's all I'll say.  Why is there a tape of Boss Coughing?  And this is all for a trip to L.A. to see Aerosmith as part of the MCB Icons.  Kid Rock, Sum 41, part of that show in L.A. this weekend.  All right, why don't we bring in the pickled punk?  Let's see the pickled punk.  It's a jar with a dead baby in it.  Dead baby in a jar.  And she runs off with that pickled punk.  The best pickled punk I ever had. 
[01:49:30]  The big blue one is the baby.  Hey, what's up?  Oh, look, it's in a bag.  What do you have, a bodyguard?  He gives it in a zip bag.  Keep it in a tool bag.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Don't unveil it yet.  Don't unveil it yet.  Yeah, what's your name, man?  My name's Ron.  I'm from East Islope.  All right, East Islope.  The pride of East Islope.  I used to live in East Islope, my friend.  Sorry to hear that.  I was right there on Country Village Lane.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Was that the house?  Was that the house?  Right off of Timber Point Road.  Hey, me too.  Was that the house where the...  Timber Point Elementary School.  I went to Timber Point Elementary School with the Boomer Esiason. 
[01:50:00]  Was that the house where the father...  How much was it when you clashed into?  Yeah, what was her name?  Ronnie Welker.  We used to F-R-Solpe.  I'm kidding.  Holy...  Are you insane?  You see, it's so out there, it's...  All right, um...  I was going to ask you if that's when you were living in the house where the father killed  the whole family.  No, no, that was after we moved.  After you moved.  Okay.  We were like a military family, moving every year.  All right, so where did you find this thing in the jar?  It was really hard to get. 
[01:50:30]  Eatabullet.com.  Ah!  What a bastard.  You're plugging Norton's site, you prick.  I'd buy the tickets for Tower of Mall April 18th.  Please, don't be done with this Eatabullet.com crap.  If you wait, you'll probably get them for free outside the show.  Now, where did you get this?  Explain what happened.  Well, when I was working in the city, we were doing a demo on a school, and I found it behind  a wall.  In a school?  In a school, in a laboratory.  It was, like, dropped in a wall?  That was on a shelf in the back, and we were supposed to clean everything out and throw 
[01:51:00]  it away, and this was on the shelf.  And that was on the shelf.  It was unbelievable.  And here it is.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, my God!  Give me that!  Oh, man.  Wow.  Put a little hat on it.  Look, Voss is dodging it.  Hey, check it.  Check out its little mule.  Check out its little mule.  I just don't let Norton get too close.  What is it?  Strapped to a piece of glass?  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  This will leak, right?  No.  Who knows?  Oh, I hope it leaks all over you.  Look, it's got things.  Is that hair on its head?  Tussle it, Norton.  I don't have many friends, so I like to keep it in my room.  All right, and I'm going to pass it around the room.  All right.  It looks like it's a baby.  With somebody.  It looks like a baby that's no bigger than your...  Come on!  Four inches long.  Don't bogart that dead baby.  Oh, be passing over to me.  No bigger than, I don't know, your thumb.  One thing is you'd only need a small little bag to get it to stand in. 
[01:52:00]  Look at the wee little lad.  I can see his little brain and his little head.  He's smiling at you.  Look at him.  Look, dude, when you move it around, his whole head jiggles.  Does snow come down?  Yeah.  Turn it upside down and snow comes down.  This is really sick looking.  You see his little brain?  Yeah, the kid is frozen in time.  The black baby, you can tell, because it's not working.  Oh, Voss.  Do you use that in the deaf comedy jam? 
[01:52:30]  You had no balls to use that line.  Oh, they're going to mug me.  Look at that.  All right.  Look at the little feet and you see the little toes.  All right.  What'd you name him?  Howard.  We'll leave it at that.  There we go.  Look at him.  Hold him up.  Little punk.  Little punk.  He's a little guy, Jimmy.  When the water moves... 
[01:53:00]  Stop rubbing him like that.  It's inappropriate.  Yeah, when the water moves.  Look at his head like jello.  I know.  You think it's Michael J. Fox on CNN.  Oh, man.  Well, I was the only one watching that uncomfortable interview and I wanted to...  It's like, whenever he moves, you want to just play to-do, run, run, run.  You guys give me a ticket to bring him out to the show?  Oh, well, that's...  This might be...  This is pretty good.  Breastfeeding mom.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I saw the doctor outside.  I might be in some...  Oh, really?  ...tough competition.  All right.  John from Staten Island says, can we put a black hat on it and make it dead baby Earl? 
[01:53:30]  Good idea.  All right.  Why don't we step aside and bring in our next...  Wow, dudes.  You can hang out.  Bravo.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  That's a cool paper.  Are we all in agreement this guy is in the lead for the trip to L.A.?  I would say, even though four-year-old breastfeeding off of his mom in front of us is weird, it's  weird to see, but it is something you kind of could see somewhere.  And a lot of people call and say, hey, that happened to me. 
[01:54:00]  Our own intern, Lee, breastfed until she was six.  Who knew that?  Tell mom if she breastfeeds the dead baby here, she wouldn't.  Yeah, we brought that up.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Pick him up by his little smart mind.  Give him a little scratch.  Watch him laugh.  Little pickled legs moving around.  Lee's all mad.  I know.  How old is home on a burger and enjoy him?  Oh, God.  How old do you think the baby is at this point?  Fourteen.  Probably.  No, I mean...  That can't be...  Maybe four months. 
[01:54:30]  That's no way four months.  No?  I think it would be a laugh to put him on a toothpick and put him in an hors d'oeuvre tray at  a party.  He's not an extra value meal.  Wouldn't that be great?  Hey, that's...  Just put him on a little hors d'oeuvre toothpick.  That's no pig in a blanket.  That's my son.  I'm like a pickled pig in a blanket, please.  Oh, God.  Little fella.  All that potential...  They wouldn't let me sell it on eBay.  They threw it off.  Oh, you were trying to sell it on eBay?  No body parts or, I guess, whole bodies either.  What were you selling it for? 
[01:55:00]  I tried to get $1,000 for it.  Really?  I'm not working.  If anyone wants to buy this baby, I'll sell my son.  Wow.  We're thinking about it.  You're hard.  I'll sell pieces of them, too.  No, what we should do, we should go down to the local supermarket and have it ride the  little carousel outside the supermarket.  Holy Jesus.  Bring it over to East Sushi.  Put it on the conveyor belt.  Put it on the conveyor belt.  Just be like a distraught, like, father.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Put the jar on the carousel scene.  You could walk up to a movie theater and pay the cheap price for it. 
[01:55:30]  Put it right up on the counter.  Watch the ticket taker.  Like, just freak out.  Here's my little lad.  When she hands you the ticket, say, no, he likes it better.  Just leave it on top of the jar.  He likes doing it himself.  He's handicapable.  He's not handicapped.  Oh, my God.  Stop making fun of my son.  All right.  Step aside.  Thank you, sir.  Very good.  Oh, God.  Let's bring in the doctor.  You might remember the doctor from the famous show we did, What the Hell is That? 
[01:56:00]  Oh, really?  The show that got Jim Norton to stop smoking.  And how long has it been, Jim?  Three months since I quit cigarettes and four days since I've had a mule.  Hey.  Well, you're bound to fall off that wagon.  All right.  Here comes the doctor.  Right on to a fresh, hot mule.  Remember this guy?  Yeah.  This guy is legit.  We know for sure.  Can I ask you something, though, right now?  And this isn't even a question or something that I'm asking.  I'm telling you this.  Don't tell us what it is. 
[01:56:30]  Can you go over where Voss is?  You want to see it, right?  And have Rich Voss come around to that mic.  Because I am so...  No, over here.  Voss, what do you want?  Move me.  I am so serious.  Ben, move up.  Move aside.  I am so serious.  Move that mic around.  No, all the way over here.  I want front row seats for this, my friend.  There we go.  Take your bag of whatever the F that is and go over there with it.  Now, do you want the one that's...  All right, but what are you laying down on the counter?  It looks like a diaper. 
[01:57:00]  You don't have a pickled punk, too, do you?  Yeah.  Might leak a little pickle juice out of his balloon knot.  He's got some...  Now, you go over there with that.  All right.  Because I want no part of any of this.  I don't want to see you, Norton.  Now, hold on.  Are you just trying to shock us, or do you really want to go to L.A.?  Oh, no.  I have no desire to go to L.A.  Good for you.  None at all.  Wow.  If I win, all I want to do is play softball.  Oh, interesting, interesting.  He wants to play.  He's kind of a big guy. 
[01:57:30]  Looks like a big hitter.  Yeah.  You play much?  I saw you guys play last year.  Yeah, I think, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Like, we should be asking, well, are you good enough?  Are you more of a pitcher or a catcher?  All right.  And you're the catcher, Norton?  Um, he's got some Mark McGuire arms on him there.  I think he could hit.  So, you should tell everyone what you do for a living.  Obviously, you're a doctor, but what kind of doctor?  You can be as vague as you need to be.  Yeah.  I'm a medical doctor.  Okay.  All right.  Let's just leave it at that. 
[01:58:00]  And he's got two tubs in front of him.  Two tubs.  He's pulling out gloves now.  He has put down all sorts of...  Of course, we have a lot of gloves.  If you want a...  What kind of...  Here, I'll...  Handle.  No, I'll be...  God damn you.  I'd like a pair of gloves.  I want one of those.  What are you putting the gloves on for?  It's not every day you get to do something like this.  I'll put these on just to shake Norton's hand.  You're going to...  All right.  We never shake hands at all.  I know.  We disgust each other.  Wait.  He's whispering something.  I'm going to turn off my mic. 
[01:58:30]  I hope he's putting his God damn gloves on.  Okay.  No problem.  I don't...  He doesn't want this photograph because this is...  I guess we could say this much.  This is part of a patient.  A current patient.  A current patient?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  Yeah.  I don't want any part of this.  That's all right.  I can't get further away and still be part of this show.  All right.  Go ahead, Doc.  First of all, these aren't diapers. 
[01:59:00]  They're surgical chucks.  All right.  We just use it for whatever may spew out whenever.  Okay?  It absorbs everything.  Everything.  That's what his car seats are made of.  Dude, would they look good on a man's back?  It stops it right up, does it?  All right.  He's opening up one.  Is it going to stink?  This one, actually, I can't leave open that long because it's very strong.  The other one...  Now, the smell, is it what it's preserved in or is it the... 
[01:59:30]  The smell is just the formalin.  All right.  So, that's what it's preserved.  Formalin.  Nothing.  Everyone.  Awful.  I wonder why.  All right.  I'm pointing out my nose.  What the hell is that?  I don't want to...  Heck no.  Holy ass!  Dude.  What is that?  You could stay right there.  No, I...  I swear I'll run behind the console and we'll all be over.  So, I don't bother.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I know he doesn't want to see that.  It looks like a matzo ball.  And I'm not even Jewish. 
[02:00:00]  Let me see that again.  He's pulling it out.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  God damn it.  What is that?  I had a look.  Holy ass!  Let me see.  Look.  I'm not...  All right.  All right.  No, no.  Go get it on our equipment.  Overcooked bacon.  What is it?  No, it is...  That looks like a big, huge piece of either chewed steak...  Wet beef jerky.  ...or a grizzle.  All right.  You ready?  A very...  It looks like chewed, fat...  Chewed...  I'm not looking. 
[02:00:30]  ...fat steak.  I'm not looking.  Look at it.  I'm not looking.  Oh, come on.  Stop it.  All right.  Oh, Voss is puking.  All right.  What is that?  What is it, sir?  What is it, sir?  Yeah.  Wait, he's drawing it off, I think.  Yeah.  I just want to make sure that this all doesn't go away.  All right.  What this is, is this is...  Oh, my God.  Actually, somebody's esophagus.  Oh, God.  Duh!  Okay?  Yeah.  So, what they've done is they've taken out the esophagus, right?  So, it's sitting sort of like...  Is your esophagus supposed to be that big?  He put it down. 
[02:01:00]  Is that where the problem is?  I put it down.  Ant.  No, no, no.  Ant will not look.  Don't mess with him.  I'm looking through my fingers.  This part is the stomach.  That part is the stomach?  It's only a little bit of the stomach.  Okay.  I got you.  I'm with you so far.  When you flip it over...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay?  Oh!  This part is a big cancer.  Yeah!  Let me check out cancer.  Hold on.  Move it over.  This is for real.  No jokes there, boys.  That's cancer?  That is it.  Where is it?  Where is it? 
[02:01:30]  Dude!  A cancerous esophagus.  And this is just sort of what we call...  These are rugel folds of the stomach.  The big casino, Tony.  This is a big cancer.  Can I touch it?  Tony, I need Dr. Kennedy.  I need Dr. Kennedy to take care of my cancer.  Tony.  Wow!  Put it back in your pants, though.  I got the big casino.  Look at Norton trying to have sex with it.  You're a disgusting man.  I gave the old cancer a tussle.  Oh, God!  He did give it a little tussle.  I did.  I tussled it.  Wow.  Mine and R.E.S.  If we could have somebody eat a piece of cancerous stomach... 
[02:02:00]  That's so funny.  Well, hold on.  I'll tell you right now.  Steve.  What's up, guys?  Where are you?  Right in New York City.  Come on down.  What do I get to eat?  The cancerous esophagus.  What about the nails of the dead baby?  No, I can't do that.  Cancerous esophagus.  Okay.  I'll be down there.  No!  Stop it!  All right.  The doctor's puking now, Ian.  Okay.  What was that from?  Smoking or...?  I mean, most of the time, people that are going to wind up having... 
[02:02:30]  This is really at the distal esophagus.  So, by distal, we mean that the part that starts at the beginning is going to be proximal.  The part that's towards the end is the distal.  That's what I was thinking.  And at the gastroesophageal junction, where the distal esophagus is going to be the cardiac  region of the stomach.  You got that, Norton?  No, that's where we part company.  All right.  Go ahead.  That's fine.  I got it.  Now, I mean, a lot of people, either from alcohol...  It happens that people that live in the Far East, for whatever reason, have some sort 
[02:03:00]  of predilection to the world.  Oh, you mean the Asian people?  Far East?  Like that?  Yeah.  He just threw the cancerous esophagus down because he's laughing so hard, Anthony.  All right.  Do you want to continue, or...?  Well, how's the patient?  Is it going to be all right?  This patient should be okay.  Seriously.  What the hell do you replace the esophagus with?  Well, you can do what's known as a colonic interposition.  Oh, I've heard this.  Say, take the stomach and put it up in your back.  Well, you take the colon, and you actually bring the colon up. 
[02:03:30]  Okay?  So, you cut out a small piece of colon.  Yeah.  And then you act...  You link the colon between the proximal part of the esophagus down to whatever part of  the stomach is left.  Hey, dude, someone's saying we could get cancer from smelling the cancer.  Oh, stop it.  Okay.  Now, if you smelled it for years on end, maybe.  From the preservative, right?  All right.  All right.  Can you put the cancer away?  All right.  I'm over there touching the cancer and laughing and having fun with it.  Let's burn it and snort it.  With mayonnaise, how many grams of fat would that be? 
[02:04:00]  I was a damn boss.  Wow, that was cool.  What else do you have, sweetie?  Sweetie.  I hope you saved the best for last.  Definitely no hot breath.  Oh, God.  Did you save the best for last?  Yeah.  Hey, dude, you're getting cancer all over our studio.  Oh, God.  There's cancer on the bottom of your bucket.  That's the hottest piece of cancer I've ever seen.  And I've had them all over the world.  I ain't no esophagus. 
[02:04:30]  I hate that story.  Did you do this one?  Why?  The other one's even worse?  Well, this one's much worse.  Oh, the next bucket is much worse, Anthony.  Much worse.  No, no.  You're saying the one at your show is worse.  No, no.  No, he's smart.  He's been on the show.  He knows you always finish, you know, with your strong joke.  An esophagus in this position can't afford to look ridiculous.  She ran off with him with his guinea charm and his cancerous esophagus.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's today's showstopper, I believe.  I wanted to have a couple of others, but unfortunately, because... 
[02:05:00]  Are you going to get in trouble for showing us cancer?  Johnny Fontaine will not get that cancer.  As long as nobody in Jersey...  All right.  Here we go.  This bucket is a lot bigger than the first one.  Holy ass!  No, no.  Stop it.  Holy ass!  What is that private pile?  Holy ass!  No, stop it.  Stop it.  Dude, you've got to take a peek into that.  I'm looking.  Again, don't even bother. 
[02:05:30]  How about just a peek?  No, no, no.  A peek!  I will not even come over here.  Don't.  Don't.  Dude, come back here.  I've got to see what the F.  You're not getting the full gist right now.  What is that pile?  Wait, he's going to pull it out.  It's much different than what you think it is.  Trust me.  Wait, can I guess what it is?  You have to guess?  Go ahead.  You're never going to guess what this is.  Is it a cancerous stomach?  No.  That's not a stomach?  No, it's not a lot.  Is it cancer?  Yes, but you can't see it.  You've got another bucket of cancer. 
[02:06:00]  What do you mean?  It looks like a throat on someone.  My act.  This man has my act.  How about I throw a bucket of cancer on you?  There's cancer all out in the barracks.  You're like...  Dude, it's still like the cancerous Gallagher up on stage just smashing cancerous organs.  Is this guy alive still?  She is still alive.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wait a minute.  Is it a uterus?  No, but we could have...  There's one... 
[02:06:30]  Dude, if that's a...  I don't have the specimen, but the worst thing I've ever seen actually was part of a uterus.  But I don't know if you really want to hear that.  Yeah.  If this is a cancerous boob, is it a breast?  I think it is.  Is that a breast?  He's pulling it out.  Can we get the kid to suck in there?  Oh, my God!  Dude, don't get cancer over everything!  There's cancerous teeth on the screen, man.  That can't...  What is that?  That...  No, that looks like something out of a science fiction movie. 
[02:07:00]  Stop it.  Oh, my God.  It's a cancerous breast.  I'm going to puke.  That's just wrong.  I can't even take this anymore.  I cannot friggin' sit here.  Look at Norton feeling it!  Ah!  Norton, stop it!  Look at him.  He's friggin' feeling it.  I know that's a cancerous breast because I saw that operation on...  What was it?  We haven't seen the cancer.  I know.  Well, that's skin, right?  This is skin.  Right. 
[02:07:30]  Christ almighty.  She's...  She's like a...  It looks a lot worse than it really is.  Oh, no.  No, it doesn't.  A lot worse.  You removed half her body.  Or she was well...  You know, she had biggies.  Where's the cancer, sir?  How big was she?  She must have had like 38 triple Ds.  Oh, God.  This is all fat.  All right?  Yeah?  The vast majority of this is not fat.  Now, you flip this over.  Oh, my God.  So, this is...  The breast sort of sits like that.  Holy S. 
[02:08:00]  Now, most of...  All of the yellow is fat.  Yeah, I understand that.  It's black because some of it's decayed or some of it's been dyed.  Right.  But when you open it up, there's a large mass right here.  That's cancer?  This is a cancer.  Oh, God damn it.  Wow.  That's cancer?  That's why you get mammograms.  This is why you do...  That's a...  How big is that?  That's...  It's got to be four to five centimeters.  And she's... 
[02:08:30]  Is she an older lady?  Take it in your head.  Uh...  I honestly...  I, uh...  This lady...  This specimen I got, I...  I didn't really know this lady, so...  You can actually put your mule in that.  Oh, my God, Jim.  What?  Ugh.  I am stupefied.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Give it a little tweet.  Well, I'm not going to tweet.  I'll tweet the...  No, get away from me.  That's fine.  You can look at it.  I'm not looking.  Turn it over.  Turn it over.  I won't tweak the tumor. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, come on.  That's the nipple.  What happened to that?  Well, this is just...  Oh, you kept the nipple so she could have, uh, like, something that looks like a boob, right?  Sometimes you might, so that you're able to have, I guess, a pseudoprosthesis that would  look sort of similar to a real nipple.  Yeah.  More of a goof if you have the whole thing with you, though.  Ladies, this is why you, uh...  You breastfeed.  Hey, where did Ben go?  Look at Ben.  Ben is giving us the fingers in the other studio.  Yeah, Ben wants no part of this, and I agree with him.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[02:09:30]  It's a delicious bulge in Ben's slacks.  I want to touch cancer.  Oh, God.  Touch it.  Oh, my...  It's that hard?  Is it...  Cancer's hard?  Obviously, it's going to vary, but the amount of fibrous tissue that you have is going to  make something harder.  Most of the things, like a ligament, a tendon, is all fibrous tissue.  Hey, uh, Opie.  Finley, uh, it says, uh, the winner, if you combine both of them, get the four-year-old  to suckle off the cancerous breast.  I just...  Is that what you said?  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Norton.  I'm not listening, because I'm disgusted. 
[02:10:00]  No, it's hot, right?  I'm disgusted.  That's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life, right there.  Cancer is booby.  Oh, that's...  Ladies, get your mammograms.  Yeah.  There you go.  We teach things on this show.  Yeah.  Highly educational.  That's a twisted way.  We can have to sneak it under someone's pillow.  Opie, Opie.  How do you get cancerous off your hands?  No, no.  See, here's where you're a jackass.  How do you get cancer off your hands?  Opie, you're touching your friggin' mic with the gloved hand.  No, this one.  Oh, and you didn't do anything with that hand? 
[02:10:30]  No.  You were just trying to take your glove off with that hand.  Yes, you were.  Don't you understand?  You're getting it all over.  You're getting cancer everywhere.  You can't get cancer everywhere.  You're putting it everywhere.  I want Pete Johnson in here to disinfect the entire station.  Dude, there's cancer juice all over the monitors.  He's not careful with cancer.  His lip smells worse.  The cancer all over the studio or the mics when we came in today?  Because Pete does his thing and...  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:00]  I can't believe this today.  Do you have any towels?  Yeah, we need towels.  We need a mop.  Remember when we used to have naked teen chicks on the show?  Now we have cancer on the show.  You may get cancer, but then again, maybe one of us won't.  Andrew, if I T.F. the cancer boob, do I win the trip?  Stop it.  That was a huge tumor. 
[02:11:30]  It was as big as, I don't know, like two...  Yeah, like an apple.  Look at that cancer.  Like a red delicious...  No, like a macintosh apple.  Like a macintosh apple.  Like a crispy hard apple.  Big as your freaking head.  Spidey, look at your foot.  I've seen that operation on the Operation Channel.  Oh, great.  You watch that, huh?  They remove the boob and then they...  I don't know.  I think they take the stomach up and then push it through the hole.  You can do something.  It's called a tram flap. 
[02:12:00]  It's a transrectus abdominis muscle flap.  Oh, wait.  I'll explain because I saw this.  Oh, Dr. Ropey, please.  Yeah, all right.  So they remove the boob, right?  So now you've got a big, huge circle that is just nothingness, right?  Right, a divot.  So then they take, like, they take from here to the belly button, okay?  Yeah.  So the waistline to the belly button.  So it gives you about, what, four or five inches?  Uh-huh.  They cut here, cut here.  Yeah.  Twist it sideways.  Right, Doc?  And push it through the skin from underneath, pop it out where the boob used to be, cut 
[02:12:30]  off the excess, and then sew up the lady down below.  So now your belly skin is actually up by where your chest is.  It's called a whole operation on TV.  Sorry.  The two things really are, one is that the skin is going to be malleable enough that it  can sort of cover that entire distance.  The second part is going to be that you need to keep something that has a good enough  vascular pedicle is what it's called.  It needs enough blood flow.  A little blood flow there.  So that's why it's still connected when they twist it and put it up.  That's fascinating. 
[02:13:00]  This is great.  Man, where were you when we were doing the 55-gallon drum challenge?  With a cricket in the ear?  No.  I would have thrown that on someone.  Ah, Ken, what's going on?  God, this is just the worst cringe radio I've ever heard.  Dude, you've got to see how big this boob was.  Oh, God, I'm never touching a woman's boob again.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, yeah, that might be a problem, though.  H-Box from Jersey saying the quote of the year is don't get cancer all over everything. 
[02:13:30]  Why do we even have to say that?  Now, a lot of doctors call and say you're breaking all sorts of rules there, Doc.  Well, you know.  Well, stop with your sticks in the mud.  Just relax.  Get a hold of yourself.  They helped me quit smoking.  Educational.  So if he breaks a few rules and he helps somebody quit smoking, get a hold of yourself.  You know, because, yeah, the last time you were in, Doc, he hasn't had a cigarette since.  And I guarantee ladies are speeding to their doctors right as we speak.  No, you're not.  You're soon.  Shut up.  Dr. Kevorkian checking in from Jersey saying, I think Anthony's overreacting. 
[02:14:00]  Cancer is guest of the week.  Funnier than Voss.  Oh, God.  Take a beating.  Don't you?  I have to take a beating.  I know, but it's funny.  Cancer is funnier than Voss.  I'll tell you one thing.  It's two things that it's hard to get rid of.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  No, don't leave any cancer with us.  Take all your cancer.  No, no, take your cancer and go.  He wants to put his cancer right in our bucket here. 
[02:14:30]  No.  Very nice.  You put that on Earl's desk?  Oh, wow.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That was, oh.  Some other people asking if this is part of our art, Opie.  This is very art.  That you brought up on the O'Reilly show.  Art.  I think I can mold something out of that.  Yamuda from Boston says, luscious, luscious cancer.  Hooray for cancer. 
[02:15:00]  Voss, what are you showing us?  I'm actually got a little bump with skin cancer.  Oh, stop it.  You should show me a notebook of jokes and say, is that awful?  I don't have a whole notebook full.  All right.  Ben is saying we've got to take a break.  Ben, why don't we do that?  Yeah, you're disgusted too, right?  But cancer guy, well, we still got to decide because, I mean, pickled punk in a jar is pretty  interesting.  Hey, you know something?  I laugh at pickled punk.  Yeah.  Huh?  Anybody can get cancer.  Anyone can get cancer. 
[02:15:30]  Look at him trying to sell his pickled punk as the winning contestant.  I kind of like what he's saying, though.  Anyone can get cancer.  Not everyone can get a pickled punk.  I think we should have this guy with a pickled punk.  You know what?  My vote goes to you.  Thank you.  I think we should have the guy with a pickled punk go out on the street and do something  with a pickled punk.  You know?  Maybe go order some coffee at Starbucks or do something with a pickled punk, you know?  Let's send him to a mall so he can get one of those cute little t-shirts made.  Oh, my daddy's girl.  Have him take a picture and put it on a t-shirt. 
[02:16:00]  God damn it, we've got to do that.  Let's do that, please.  Please, let's do that.  Could you at least walk through the KB toys with the pickled punk and just cry really loud?  I'll go down the truck aisle.  That is disgusting.  Do you have anything for a zero to no month?  All right, look.  Hold on.  All right, look.  Jim from Jersey sums it up a little here, saying that this just tells you how bad Sandy 
[02:16:30]  Kane's twatto is if everyone will touch cancer.  Remember?  No one touched her.  But you guys are just feeling the hell out of the tumors.  Let's take it down to the ballpark and just put a little hat over the jar.  Roll it into second slide.  Well, you have a half hour to beat pickled punk boy and cancer dude.  Oh, good luck.  Good luck is right.  We'll figure it all out in just a bit. 
[02:17:00]  The L.P. and Anthony Show.  I just want to be with a man who'll ignore me and take me for granted.  He's only pretending to be interested in who I am and what I think so he can get into my tail.  Dirty girls will love to you.  O.P.  Do you know where a guy can get a rub and a tug around here?  And to me.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:17:30]  We just had a visit from cancer.  Yes.  And he killed.  Ha, ha, ha.  Now all the Rich Voss cancer jokes are coming in.  Well, that's somebody who wrote a little joke like that, kind of, uh, so what's the difference  between a cancer and Rich Voss cancer kills?  This is just, uh, not right.  Let's see how far we can beat this into the ground.  Yes, Ian. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  What's the difference between cancer and Voss?  Cancer grows on you.  Oh.  Oh.  You got stuff.  You're in it later.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  I want to thank, uh, Tommy from Brooklyn for sending me the link to teenplanet.org, O.P., to  cleanse the palate of, uh, seeing cancer.  When you see a cancerous breast laid out on the console and a cancerous stomach, the only  thing that could really settle you down are, uh, young, scammily-clad girls. 
[02:18:30]  Yes.  We got, like, 10, 15 minutes left in the, the, the contest for the trip to L.A. to see  MTV Icon with Aerosmith.  If you can beat cancer, you got about 15 minutes to do it.  Uh, Rick the Psychic, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  You guys are doing a good job there.  I'll tell you, I'll tell you who's going to win.  You're going to tell him who's going to win the contest.  He's a psychic.  Yeah.  The guy, the guy with the cancer on your stomach is going to win. 
[02:19:00]  Cancer guy.  Cancer to your stomach is.  Cancer's going to win today.  Uh-huh.  Cancer's definitely going to win today.  After he, after he goes out, he's going to enjoy himself with a nice trip to L.A.  Unless somebody can come down there with the next 10 minutes, which I doubt it.  I don't see anybody down there.  You don't see anything in the future of, uh, anything that could, uh, beat that?  Boy, Rick, uh, you're...  No, I don't.  And I'll tell you, hey, I want to ask Norton something.  He's going out on a, on a, on a limb with this one, Anthony.  He certainly is.  I'm not going to ask you.  Cancer, cancer's going to win.  Boy, cancer wins more than the Yankees, you idiot.  What would you like to ask me, you total ass? 
[02:19:30]  Hey, Norton.  Norton.  Norton.  Yes.  If you, if you, if you, if you had hangers as big as that cancer esophagus, you'd be  able to shovel your snow by putting a snow shovel at the end of it.  What the heck?  If, if, if I had...  No, you know, down below, as big as that cancer thing, you'd be able to have it down to your  knees.  All you have to put is the end of a snow shovel.  You'd be able to shovel your walk.  I really don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, my God. 
[02:20:00]  You complete and total buffoon.  Let's go to Jimmy from Boston.  Uh, Jimmy.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  See, we burned him out, eh?  We burned him out.  That's what, hold on, hold on, hold on.  That's good, uh, that could very well happen to Frenchie.  That's the burnout right there.  We've got to be very careful with our new characters.  Hey, Norton.  We just burned out, uh, Ricky the Psychic.  It's your thing about down below with a shovel on it.  What?  What?  Uh, Jimmy, go ahead.  From Boston.  Yes.  Okay, guys, I want to say I stand corrected.  I really think that cancer, the breast cancer thing beat the spleen. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, I hate to tell, uh, Boston, but I think New York beat you today.  Um, yeah.  I want to apologize for that, but I don't want to apologize to saying Boss sucks.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  All right.  That's with one S.  Uh, let's go to Melanie from Philly.  Melanie.  Hey.  What's up, Melanie?  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  Good, Tom.  I wanted to let you know that I have a friend that would be perfect to be Asian Earl.  Asian Earl?  Asian Earl. 
[02:21:00]  Perfect for Asian Earl.  Will he dress completely in black tomorrow?  Oh, definitely.  You've got to go to, like, either foundrymusic.com or opianthony.com to see what Black Earl looks  like, and you've got to try to look at it as much like him as possible.  Oh, he definitely will.  All right.  We'll go with Asian Earl tomorrow.  All right.  All right.  So just, uh, come on up.  Okay, great.  All right.  Bye, guys.  You know what, though?  They say, but the thing in Boston, that was the guy's spleen, though.  It was his own spleen.  Yeah.  He got in.  So you've got to get points for that. 
[02:21:30]  That was pretty good.  That's, you know.  Hey, I'm just saying I think.  I don't know, man.  You know.  But when you, you know, you bring in cancerous organs like that and just lay them out.  Yeah.  That's a little, a little severe.  You missed giving a little nip tweak.  Good thing.  I'm very glad I did.  That's how twisted I am.  I went right for the, to tweak the tumor instead of the, instead of the nip.  Ugh.  Yuck.  All right.  Um, speaking of Earl, the saga continues.  Ant, can you do a good job with this in a 30, I don't know, a minute? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Um, our own black Earl, you know.  Because we have a song now we have to play.  He has problems with, uh, the Opie and Anthony show.  He's been, uh, you know, we, we've good-natured, uh, we've ragged him over the years.  He's been in good nature, but he seems to get upset about it.  And, uh, the straw that broke the camel's back, we, uh, taped the conversation he was having  with, uh, an intern during some interview process, and, uh, he didn't like that, and  now he's cut himself off from the Opie and Anthony show.  Even though he did show up for our celebrity softball meeting. 
[02:22:30]  Yes, he did today, for some apparent reason.  Uh, what, but what we, we want to do is move on.  We want to get cast a new black Earl.  Just do the same thing Earl does.  Not change the name or anything, just like Darren Stevens.  Unbewitched, you might remember that.  Yep.  Uh, same, same situation.  So we need somebody that kind of resembles Earl and could, uh, do his job, which is tricky  because his job is doing nothing at all.  Right.  And, uh, he's done a great job of doing that today.  Who's, who's our?  Go F yourself, man.  Go F yourself. 
[02:23:00]  See, you know what?  Too much attitude in that.  Oh, really?  You sound too much like a brother.  You got to go, go F yourself.  Go F yourself.  Well, hmm.  Try it.  Just go, oh, go F yourself.  Oh, go F yourself.  Oh, that's good.  Very good.  That was good.  Now rub the top of your head.  Your head has to be turned around.  Yeah, yeah.  Scratch your head and just rub your head.  Yeah, there you go.  He looks like a girl.  He's dressed completely in black.  But instead of the Yankee hat, he's got the Met hat on.  Under no certain circumstances, I will wear a Yankees hat.  Wow. 
[02:23:30]  It's for black girl, you know.  It's like ying and yang without the party with these two.  You know what I mean?  He looks very, uh, very much like a girl.  Yeah, well, pictures were taken.  His name is Lent.  And Lent, uh, you got here at what, three?  Yeah.  And what have you done since three o'clock?  I've seen cancer.  I've seen, uh, breastfeeding.  Yeah, but what have you done?  What have I done?  Uh, drink beer.  Go on the web.  Do nothing.  Do you play any pinball?  Uh, yeah.  A little bit.  So you...  Like, post-pinball.  You've pretty much done nothing.  Absolutely nothing, right? 
[02:24:00]  Absolutely nothing.  All right.  Well, that's great.  I skipped three classes to do absolutely nothing.  Right on.  Can you describe to us, and be honest, can you describe what the public file is?  What is a public file?  Good.  He doesn't know either.  Exactly.  And he can't explain it.  Our Earl is a lazy Earl.  Yeah.  I think this Earl did a very good job today, Emily.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Representing the show and stuff.  Yeah, I would like to do a sticker shop, you know.  Sticker shop.  Sticker shop.  Good, good.  No, this is good.  Any mistake you make is gold.  Let me ask you a question. 
[02:24:30]  And if you take the van out, will you get lost?  Maybe.  Yeah.  You can put me in Jersey.  You've got to get lost if you drive the van.  Well, you had a lot of fun being Earl today.  Tomorrow, I guess a guy's coming down to be the Asian Earl.  Asian Earl.  We're trying to get an Asian Earl, a midget Earl.  We're trying to get a drunk Irishman Earl.  We're trying to get a flamboyantly gay Earl.  Flaming over-the-top gay Earl.  The key to this bit is to dress completely in black if you show up.  So, if Asian Earl shows up tomorrow and he's not in black from Philly, he's out of here, 
[02:25:00]  right?  He's going to play a bumblebee with all that black and yellow.  Oh, God.  And, Anthony, the poo-poo platters have sent in a song about Earl.  A song about Earl.  And the latest saga.  Take a listen.  He wears jet black jeans, sunglasses too, with dark black skin, like fresh doggie dew.  And I think to myself, what a wonderful Earl. 
[02:25:30]  The colors of Earl's rainbow are many shades of black. 
[02:26:00]  His socks, his shoes, and his black t-street around his black negro sack.  I see friends shake their heads.  What the hell does Earl do?  Nobody's really sure.  Not even Earl can tell you.  Oh, you cry.  Babies cry.  I watch them grow.  They'll learn more than Earl.  And probably be slow.  Oh, that I think to myself, what a wonderful Earl. 
[02:26:30]  Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful Earl.  Wow.  The poo-poo platters, Anthony.  Wow.  Bringing a tear to my eye.  We're going to miss Earl.  That is a great song.  As we cast a new Earl for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  Very nice.  Today we have the, well, the new black Earl. 
[02:27:00]  Well, I want to ask you a question.  Yes.  What do you want on this wall?  Ah.  What do you want on this wall?  What do you want on this wall?  Very good.  How long would it take you to hang a picture?  Probably less than him.  Really?  It would take probably like four hours instead of five hours.  Four hours?  Ah, that's not bad for Earl.  Would you be very appreciative if you were part of the Opie and Anthony show as the new Earl?  Absolutely.  I don't know if we like that, though.  We need someone cranky.  You need someone cranky. 
[02:27:30]  Darren Stevens' attitude didn't change when Dick Sargent took over for Dick York.  We need a very angry, unappreciative Earl.  Yeah.  As we cast the new black Earl.  But covertly angry.  You can't be angry all the time on the outside.  But you've got to go off the little waves of anger.  Black and eagle rage.  That's what I want.  And just go, oh, go F yourself and then leave the studio.  Sort of like that.  Yeah.  Did you grow a horrible mustache?  Is mine bad enough now? 
[02:28:00]  And we'll never be able to figure out why you're angry.  Very key to the new Earl.  Uh-huh.  A lot of people don't know why I'm angry, so.  Oh, I don't wonder what he did.  All right.  Well, we want to thank Len for coming in to do absolutely nothing as he tries out to be the new Earl, Andrew.  Great job.  You just hung out, right?  Oh, yeah.  Well, there you go.  Asian Earl tomorrow, Anthony.  I can't wait.  Can't wait.  Hey, Nate, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Where are you calling from?  Clyde, New York, up by Rochester.  Ro-cha-cha.  Clyde, New York.  Up by Rochester.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on with your station up here, guys? 
[02:28:30]  I don't even get to hear you until 9 o'clock at night.  Yeah, I guess they bumped us to 9 now, I'm hearing.  That sucks.  We're trying to work out things with Rochester.  Uh-huh.  Good.  I hope they make the right decision.  Yes.  Don't basically start promoting your show.  Nah, they don't want to do that.  Hey, I'm just hoping Rochester makes the right decision.  I think there's a lot of people that would love to hear Opie and Anthony a little earlier.  What you got over there, Margie?  That really is a horrible accent. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, are you from Rochester, Nate?  No, I'm from Clyde.  No, I'm from the Rochester area.  Oh, yeah.  God, I lived up there a long time.  You sound like you're from Fargo.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would sound stupid.  The redneck coming out of me, I guess.  That would sound stupid.  All right.  So you were with the funny-looking one?  Yeah, funny-looking.  All right, Nate, we're going to try to work things out, so keep your fingers crossed.  You suck.  All right.  Thank you, Nate.  More shows about cancer, and I think we're going to win them over.  That's the key. 
[02:29:30]  Anthony?  Yes.  We forgot to play today's Wesley Willis song.  Which one are we going with today?  You get to pick, my friend.  I had such three.  There's so many favorites.  All right, look.  We promised the O.J. song, but you know what?  You can go off the chart here, Tom.  I got to go.  Even though I love chronic schizophrenia, I got to go with Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey?  I got to go with Kill Whitey.  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on one second.  Great song.  Mount Everest guy is checking in.  Dave.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  No, no, I'm just tired. 
[02:30:00]  Why are you tired?  Just coming off of a flight right now, laying over for 45 minutes.  Where?  Right now I'm in London.  You're in London?  Yes, I am.  How can you prove that you're in London on your way to Mount Everest to put that WOW flag on the top of Mount Everest?  I really don't know.  There's no way I can really prove it, I guess.  What time is it right now in London?  I'm sorry?  What time is it right now in London?  It's a little after midnight.  Okay.  I don't know if that's right or not.  All right.  It seems right.  It sounds right.  And where are you calling from right now? 
[02:30:30]  Wait, wait, Ben.  Say that.  Right now I'm on my cell phone.  Hold on.  What?  Five hours.  Tell him to grab someone.  I hear American cell phones don't work over there.  They do.  I have AT&T, Worldwide Service.  Tell him to grab someone.  Yeah, grab someone off the street.  With an accent.  There is no street here.  Where are you?  Right now I'm in an overseas terminal.  It's really quiet right now.  What's your name in the airport?  Real quick.  I'm sorry?  What's your name in the airport?  London International, I assume.  I mean, all I know is they said we're flying into London.  You're lying.  Isn't it Heathrow?  Heathrow.  I'm not sure with names. 
[02:31:00]  I'm not too familiar with names.  You would not know the airport you're flying into?  I know the main one.  This is just a home in between.  Man, your story is falling apart every time we put you on the air.  Yeah, guys.  Dude, it's kind of falling apart.  Yeah, get someone.  Get someone that's in the terminal.  All right, let me try to walk around here and find somebody.  Right now I know there's a lot of people sleeping.  Well, grab somebody.  So I can get killed?  No, wake someone up.  Yeah, what's the big deal?  Offer them a couple pounds.  You're telling me there's not one person walking around that's awake? 
[02:31:30]  Not that I've seen, no.  Pretty much I'm the only guy.  My body's out right now looking for some food.  Is there anything making sound in the terminal?  There are some, I guess, radiators or whatever.  No, no, no.  A television, a radio.  It's not an apartment in the village.  It's an airport.  Well, there's different screens and monitors with the different flight departures and arrivals,  but that's about it.  No announcements in the background, have you noticed?  Yeah.  I haven't heard that yet.  It's been really quiet.  Nothing.  No, the overseas is really quiet here.  It's kind of a little number from the A-track.  No security?  I'm sorry. 
[02:32:00]  No security?  I've seen one or two walking around, but I haven't seen one in about five minutes.  Yeah, with everything that's going on in the world, yeah, there's going to be one or two.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm not really...  Dave, big disappointment.  Why the person?  Where's the rest of the people from your flight?  They're out looking for food right now.  Out looking for food?  Well, there's an overseas terminal and there's a main drag for in-country flights and whatnot,  and that's where all the food places are.  Isn't everything going into London overseas?  What are you flying on?  Well, you have your domestic flights, and then you have your overseas. 
[02:32:30]  Domestic flights in England?  Where are they?  There's no whole region.  There's no domestic flights in...  How do you know the flight schedule, but you don't know what airport you're in?  My buddy takes care of all that, man.  I'm kind of stupid when it comes to that kind of...  All right, so what airline did you take over?  U.S. Airways.  U.S. Air flies to England?  No.  U.S. Airways.  Do they?  When's your next flight leave?  It leaves a little after 1 o'clock.  And where are you going? 
[02:33:00]  Delhi, India.  All right, now let's see the trick question.  What airline are you taking from London to New Delhi, England?  Tell me you're taking U.S. Airways from London to New Delhi.  Yes, I am.  It's a direct flight with a layover.  U.S. Airways.  You're an idiot, dude.  I can't...  All right, why don't you tell us finally that the whole putting a wow flag on the top of  Mount Everest is...  Yeah.  It is not BS, guys.  I'll give you the number.  I'll go find a pay phone right now.  What was your flight number? 
[02:33:30]  What was your flight number?  All right, hold on to the line.  Okay.  All right, he's going to give us a pay phone.  Rick, get him on the line.  I don't know what the country code is to dial him.  All right, go get him.  Go get him on the line.  We'll dial a phone.  He's lying.  We'll play the Wesley Willis song as we go to break.  We'll come back.  We'll talk to Mount Everest.  And we'll play What Did We Learn on the O&A show.  Highly educational show today, huh?  Right.  We need a little time to play What Did We Learn today because there was a lot going on.  But Anthony's pick of the day as we play Wesley Willis was Kill Whitey. 
[02:34:00]  Kill Whitey.  All right.  Wesley Willis.  You are no good.  You are a terrible fool.  You are a real jerk.  You are a miserable creep.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey. 
[02:34:30]  You are full of shit.  You are a no good right fuck.  You are a good-finecting, scaredy way.  Your brain is damaging to comedy in my life by cussing at me for no reason at all.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey. 
[02:35:00]  You are full of shit.  You are a stupid motherfucker.  You are a low-down snuck.  So suck a damn ass.  Don't you wanna break up, break up, break up.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Kill Whitey.  Yeah, Whitey.  Kill Whitey. 
[02:35:30]  Rock of Alaska.  Rock of Chicago.  Kill yourself.  No other very less stronger.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  And you say we don't make fun of Whitey.  Wesley Willis, Anthony.  This guy should be at Ozfest.  All of his songs have a very similar sound tone, don't they?  A little drum roll.  Hello, this is Wesley Willis.  And all of my songs sound exactly the same.  Don't matter what it is or I sing about, everything is exactly the same.  All the songs are the same. 
[02:36:00]  All my songs are the same.  All my songs are the same.  All my songs are the same.  That's right.  All my songs are the same.  I talk a little bit like this and I wait a minute and then there's a small break and  I go into the same chorus.  All my songs are the same.  All my songs are the same.  All my songs are the same.  Rock over London.  Rock on Chicago.  Peace out.  Kill Whitey. 
[02:36:30]  All right, now we've got to play.  Aren't they all the same?  They're all like that.  Well, let's see.  We're going to play a two for today.  Oh, a two for.  Chronic Schizophrenia.  Two for Tuesday.  Chronic Schizophrenia.  From Wesley Willis.  I hear this is the power ballad.  Ballad.  Because every nut has a soft side.  All right, Ben's freaking out.  We'll play it tomorrow.  Because it's a long song and we've got to play it.  Hey, Ben.  And we've got to play What Do We Learn next. 
[02:37:00]  And we've also got to give away that trip to L.A.  So we'll save that for tomorrow.  All right.  Next, what did you learn today?  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  But a few things to take care of, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's time to announce the trip to L.A.  Here we go.  To see Aerosmith MTV icon with Kid Rock and Sum 41 is going to be a great time in L.A.  I want to thank MTV for giving us two trips.  That's two to give away. 
[02:37:30]  And the winner is...  Who won?  Who won?  Pickled Punk.  Pickled Punk.  Pickled Punk.  Cancer guy won.  But doesn't want to go to L.A.  He wants to play in our celebrity softball game that is happening in another month or two.  Everyone's a winner.  So he passed on the L.A. trip, so we go to second place, which is Pickled Punk.  Wow.  So get those guys in real fast as we also try to play.  What do we learn? 
[02:38:00]  I think I might want...  Pickled Punk going L.A.  Are you bringing the Pickled Punk with you, sir?  I am psyched.  You got tickets for two.  Yeah, that'd be great in...  In that case, we'll take them.  That'd be great on security.  What?  Take them through on your carry-on.  It's just a little fetus.  He's not armed.  Kids fly free, right?  You get a whole seat.  Wouldn't that be great?  You just do that.  You put it in the seat.  And then you put them in your bag.  And now you got two seats to lounge around in.  One for free.  I want you to eat here, baby. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, God.  Any final thoughts there or words or anything, sir?  Can't wait to see your arm smell.  All right, good.  There you go.  And cancer doctor guy?  Give a shout-out to my friend Ed.  No?  Shout-out.  All right.  All right.  I want that guy on my team, though,  because he looks like he's a hitter.  You know what I mean?  Looks like you could hit.  You could have him as long as I get my brother  and fish again this year.  But then I get Pete Radovich.  You could have Pete Radovich.  He's probably very good.  Looks like he hits like a girl. 
[02:39:00]  Kids, let it be known I'm a good ball player right here.  Whatever, boss.  Boss, you're playing, right?  Yeah.  There you go.  He'll be in left field dodging the softball.  Dodging.  The ball's coming at me, and I was dodging him.  That joke kills me.  Jersey Gary Anthony.  I learned today O&A are avant-garde and progressive.  You also learned Opie completed the emo hat trick today. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  A pickled punk is worth about $1,000.  Yeah, he wants to sell this damn thing.  Really?  I think we want to take first dibs at it, though, my friend.  Yeah, keep his number.  Troy Pearson lives in Las Vegas.  You going to dedicate it to the O&A archives?  I don't know if we're going to dedicate it.  Yeah, no, that'd be a special first.  Hey, we can still give the trip to cancer, doctor.  Slow down.  I don't know.  All right.  He also learned the only thing that stinks worse  than a filthy, feces-flaming, homeless person is a boss show. 
[02:40:00]  He also learned the kids sucked less than boss did on the show today.  And finally, Jersey Gary is always good for a few every day.  Thanks, Jersey Gary, for helping us with this show, by the way.  Some future go-getters are living in the Bronx.  Brian from Philly.  I learned if you take cancer out, try not to get it all over the place.  Right.  Sheep Lover from Jersey.  I learned today, milk is liquid gold.  Young Buck from Philly.  I learned today, awesome Garrett asks awesome questions. 
[02:40:30]  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned the special boobie prize for beating Boston actually was a boobie.  Al Mack for another one here.  Today I learned that cancer wins more than the Yankees.  Yeah.  Anything over there, Ant?  Nah, I'm scrolling through, but you pretty much covered all the bases.  And Brother Joe, why don't you give your plug here?  You're playing Bar 9 tonight, right, with the gang?  Another episode.  On 9th Avenue between 53rd and 54th, two nights.  All right, very good.  And Chris, what's going on? 
[02:41:00]  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, today I learned Johnny Lontane will never get that cancer, and he'd be perfect for it.  I also learned a four-year-old breastfeeding is funny, but a baby in a jar is sexy.  And a homeless guy gets played on New York radio, but Rotgut gets nothing.  Oh, very good.  Hey, guys, what happened to the job?  The job's back.  Yeah, they're doing like four more episodes.  I think it starts tomorrow night.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, it's back.  Dennis Lurie explained that whole thing.  They had to give this stupid show a chance. 
[02:41:30]  They knew it was going to bomb, but they had to do it for whatever reason.  It's over with, and now they're back doing the job on ABC.  Clint, the fake Earl, or the guy that's trying to replace Earl.  Yeah.  Hey, I want to give a shout-out to Cheryl, Lori, and everyone on opanthony.com, all the girls over there.  And go to my site, my own personal site.  Site.com, L-E-N-T-Site.com.  All right, very good.  Very good.  And tomorrow, Anthony, WOW returns.  Right.  Yes.  In full force. 
[02:42:00]  It's always around, but we start really promoting it tomorrow.  So really fast, get a WOW on the back of your car, especially the guys and girls in the new cities.  If you want to see girls flashing on the way home from work tomorrow, you have a really good chance if you get WOW on the back of your car,  whether it's a bumper sticker from the station we're on or a homemade WOW sign.  Or if you're driving by this guy, you might just yank out the cancerous one and show it through the window.  Oh, wouldn't that be hysterical?  Well, I got WOWed by the doctor.  A little cancerous boob hanging out the window.  All right.  It's I'll come out Wednesday. 
[02:42:30]  Ah!  Poof!  It's a pleasure for me.  Hey, we got OzFest tickets to give away?  For Washington.  For Washington.  Right.
