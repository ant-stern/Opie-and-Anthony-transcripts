<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show, broadcast from a Washington, D.C. XM Satellite Radio studio, was plagued by significant microphone issues throughout, resulting in a fuzzy, bassy sound that the hosts, Opie and Anthony, frequently addressed.  They were in D.C. for undisclosed "big meetings," jokingly referring to their trip as a covert mission.  The show featured a packed schedule of meetings with XM executives and staff, detailed by an XM executive, Eric Logan, who was present in studio along with E-Rock and Nathaniel. This schedule, described as resembling a high school timetable, was punctuated by humorous anecdotes about the "maniacal" driving of Don Wicklund, an XM employee,  and recollections of past tense encounters with security during radio station takeovers and firings.

Planned guests included Al Franken and the women from the *Broad-Minded* show, sparking a discussion about the double meaning of "broad-minded."  Thanksgiving anecdotes dominated a significant portion of the broadcast.  Opie recounted his frustration with the predictable morbid conversations at family gatherings, particularly the focus on medical ailments among older relatives.  Anthony shared a similar experience, detailing a Thanksgiving conversation about a sour stomach that devolved into a lengthy discussion of digestive problems. They discussed their own Thanksgiving celebrations: Opie's solitary one, Anthony's restaurant outing after his family abandoned his cooking plans, and their observations on the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, including the "lottery" of getting hit by falling debris. A caller contributed a Thanksgiving story about their father-in-law confessing a past affair.

Other topics included listener complaints about the hosts taking Thanksgiving off, the absurdity of adult gift-giving without children, the hosts' preference for instant gratification, an upcoming eggnog drinking contest with Pat from Munaki, and a discussion about the "pan dog" breed featured on D.C. news.  A segment featured audio of other radio hosts criticizing Anthony after a contentious Miami interview.  The hosts also discussed their gaming systems and the usefulness (or lack thereof) of their company-provided BlackBerrys.  The show's promotional strategy, including a Vanity Fair photo spread and placement on Direct TV, was discussed, as was a potential upcoming announcement about a new addition to the XM family, possibly a competitor. A 1961 anti-gay short film, "Boys Beware," was played, followed by listener-submitted Dickie Goodman-style remixes, including one described as extremely racist.

A large segment focused on listener-submitted Dickie Goodman parodies.  These included a poorly executed Jaws parody, a humorous "Space Hitler" parody, and several others containing graphic and offensive humor, including jokes about AIDS, sexual acts, and copious use of racial slurs.  One particularly offensive parody, submitted by "Johnny Griswold,"  lasted four minutes and featured numerous racial slurs.  The hosts played portions of these songs, reacting to their offensive nature and engaging in debate about their comedic value. Listener calls addressed their reactions to the racist content.  Mad Mexican, a recurring guest, appeared in Chicago-themed clothing (due to his dog's name), discussed his radio show, and presented a robotic singing chihuahua.  Further discussion of child abuse followed.

A listener, Jack, called to comment on the technical difficulties and surprisingly found another radio show, featuring Tyra Banks, funny, albeit lacking the sexual content of Opie and Anthony's show.  Christine, a female guest, joined the studio and shared humorous anecdotes about her 30-day sex fast (excluding vibrators), her dating life, and her preference for casual sex.  Her personal hygiene habits were also a topic of discussion, along with extended banter about euphemisms for underwear and genitalia.  Al Franken then joined, promoting his book about Michael Jackson and discussing allegations of Jackson's inappropriate behavior with children.  The conversation shifted to politics, the upcoming presidential election, the Iraq War, and Franken's USO tours.  The segment ended with continued discussion of Christine's dating life and unsuccessful attempts to get her to show a body part on air.

The show concluded with a discussion about a woman who contacted the show, with the hosts speculating on her motives and using crude and sexually explicit language, including derogatory terms like "faggot" and "pussy."  They imagined scenarios involving alcohol and suggestive encounters, and humorously (but offensively) discussed how a potential incident would be reported in a sanitized manner. The hosts thanked an unnamed guest ("Mr. Fuddy-Duddy") and concluded with a self-congratulatory remark about the show's uninhibited nature.

[00:06:00]  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  Eric is choking me with his mic cord.  Can you figure out that we're not in New York City?  It's the usual bugs we have to go through.  It'll get fixed, though.  When we broadcast.  Yeah.  The listeners at home don't care.  If it sounds a little, I don't know, a little off. 
[00:06:30]  As long as what we're saying is funny and hysterical like it is on a daily basis, they don't care.  Yours sounds a little weird, though.  Mine does sound a little weird.  And that kind of goes away the louder I get, doesn't it?  Well, let's go to Chuck in Ohio.  Chuck, how do we sound in Radio Land?  Give me that one.  Oh, man, you guys are horrible today.  How about this?  Ah, that's even worse.  You guys are fuzzy, bassy, horrible.  Yes.  We count on being bassy. 
[00:07:00]  Funny jokes that you're going to get.  No, no, I can't.  All right, Chuck, thank you.  We'll figure this out.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Thank you.  It's, uh...  Oops, I just dropped all my templates.  Dropped something.  Yeah, a lot of people commenting that it doesn't sound quite right out there.  That lets you know at home that we're not home.  Yes, we are down in Washington, D.C.  We forgot to tell our fine listeners where we were going.  Our nation's capital. 
[00:07:30]  And they get very mad when we don't tell them where we're going.  Yeah.  For some reason.  I don't get that, but there was, like, people bitching that.  We didn't mention that we were going to Washington for a couple of days.  I thought we did.  I don't know if we actually brought it up on the air.  We're down here for some big, big meetings.  It's Washington.  We have to...  It's a covert mission.  We're in the...  We couldn't tell you.  We're deep in the Washington compound of XM Satellite Radio.  Yes, deep in the bowels of XM.  Yes.  And we're in a studio, and the mics sound a little weird, 
[00:08:00]  and we're going to figure it out as we go.  Yeah.  I mean, yesterday, they could have just gone on the air,  taking a quick 202 test.  A little 202 test during one of those  we're experiencing technical difficulties times.  They could have just maybe popped this studio up and gone,  Hey, everything working?  That might have worked.  That does sound weird.  I sound very...  Wait, you sound perfect.  Jimmy has the best mic in the studio.  My microphone sounds tinny.  I can only talk with one headphone on. 
[00:08:30]  Mine sounds okay, but then if I get a little louder,  it gates out on me.  You hear that?  You hear that?  How am I supposed to do my impersonations?  I don't know.  I do Sammy Davis Jr.  You'd think it was the real person.  You sure would.  Anyway, we'll plow through this shit  and give people a fine show, right?  We can take a whack at it.  Yeah, why not?  I don't want to use that microphone.  That microphone sounded like complete shit. 
[00:09:00]  And also, we've got lots and lots of guests coming in today,  so how are we going to do this?  Yeah.  I'm going to have to go back to the crappy microphone  when the guests arrive.  What guests do we have today?  Al Franken stopping by to say hi.  Ooh, that won't get too heated.  I'm hoping it gets heated.  That's wonderful.  I'm hoping it gets a little heated.  And then the women from Broad-Minded?  Broad-Minded.  I get it.  See, because being Broad-Minded means you're open to a lot of things.  You're Broad-Minded.  But in this case, they use that word as a broad 
[00:09:30]  because they're a bunch of broads.  They're broads with opinions.  And they come in and, what, spout them off?  I guess.  We're right next to the Take Five studios down here in Washington.  Wait a minute.  So you're saying that there's double meaning for that?  Yeah.  It could be broad, like open.  Wow, now my mic really got completely different.  That's cool.  All right, that's nice.  Or it could mean broad, like dame.  Oh.  Yeah.  Gal.  Gal-Minded.  Dame-Minded.  They're separating us from that channel. 
[00:10:00]  No.  They were a little worried that we weren't going to interact.  I like the fact that some of the broads are going to be coming in here.  I think it's great.  That's right.  They're talking.  And they're not worried about us.  They're right next door to Take Five channel.  They don't care.  I bet, you know something?  I bet they have a little moxie themselves.  I bet they're coming in here and they're going to,  hey, you guys.  Why, you?  Well, I'll show you.  We can be broad-minded.  They're going to be filled with piss and vinegar.  Right.  Full of piss and vinegar. 
[00:10:30]  Yikes.  I'll bet that a couple of them are gregarious.  Ooh.  We can dare to dream.  I cannot wait until the broad-minded chicks come in.  All right, so that's the deal.  We're in Washington, D.C.  Let me tell you something, fella.  We're in, uh...  That was just getting you used to when they come on.  Oh, yeah?  What do you have to say there, guy with a cock?  Yeah.  Well, back me up, ladies, but...  I got all the whole clips.  Right, girls? 
[00:11:00]  Right?  Shut up.  What is it?  That's someone's cell phone or Blackberry.  You know, this reminds me of a funny story.  No, it doesn't.  Right.  That's what we're going to get.  Exactly.  No, it doesn't.  That's what we're going to get, and I love it.  All right, everyone turn off their communiques.  It's time to broadcast.  And by everybody, we mean Opie.  All right, mine's off.  Turn off your crackberry.  Mine is off.  Can't seem to get enough of.  We should back up.  I guess we did a show, what, about a week ago at this point?  We only took two days off for the turkey thing. 
[00:11:30]  Thursday and Friday.  Thursday and Friday.  It was Thanksgiving and the day after.  People are bitching that we took a couple days off.  Someone bitched that we took Friday off.  Right.  Does anybody...  And I'm serious with this.  Even when I worked for a living, I truly do not remember coming in the Friday after Thanksgiving.  That was a four-day weekend.  It's Black Friday.  Is that what they call it?  Yeah, you have to go to the malls and get your early Christmas shopping.  No, you don't.  Exactly.  You lock yourself in your house.  I have three weeks before I even begin to think about Christmas. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  And begin to think about shopping.  No, have you began?  Shopping?  No, thinking about it.  Not really, no.  The horror has crept into my life already about what to get everybody.  Last year, I went the easy route.  If you recall, it was American Express gift cards.  For everybody.  The meaning behind it?  Pure shit.  It meant nothing.  There's no unwrapping it and going, ooh, he really thought this out. 
[00:12:30]  It was, here it is.  It's my attempt at making a cash gift look like I put some thought to it by putting it in a gift card.  You know the beauty of that, though?  Now that we're making some bucks.  Some cake, as they call it?  It's a thoughtless gift.  Yeah.  But, if you make the money a little higher in that thoughtless gift.  That's all it takes, right?  It turns into a very thoughtful gift.  You're banging a couple of clams out for each person.  Now it's not like they're getting 10 bucks, 20 bucks. 
[00:13:00]  Right, now they're a little confused and they're not thinking that you didn't have any thought behind it.  You know, a $50 gift certificate is a real shitty gift.  Right.  I'm sorry, people.  It is.  When you give that, it really says, I gave you no thought this Christmas.  And what are you going to do with it?  50 bucks.  You can't buy anything by itself with that.  Maybe one video game and you've still got to kick in for the tax.  I think Christmas, if you reach a certain age and you don't have kids yet, you have no responsibilities as far as Christmas goes. 
[00:13:30]  None.  You should not have to still buy mommy and daddy a gift at our age.  Why?  It's impossible to pick out things.  Why do I have to buy my sister a gift at this age?  Yeah, what are you going to get her?  There should be an age.  I don't know what it is.  You turn 30, let's say, and you don't have kids.  You have no obligation.  Mm-mm.  None.  And no one buys me anything that I actually want.  So, you know, don't turn it around on me and say, well, what about all the gifts you would receive? 
[00:14:00]  They're all a bunch of crap.  Yeah, my girlfriend says, you know, your mother's asking me, you know, what do you want?  There goes my mic again.  Your mother's asking me, what do you want for Christmas?  And I go, I don't know.  I buy whatever I want.  That's the point I'm at in my life.  Like, Jesus Christ has blessed me that on his birthday, it doesn't mean anything to me.  I can go out and get it.  Oh, your Amazon wish list? 
[00:14:30]  What's on there?  Nothing.  Because I go right to checkout.  I click on checkout and I buy it.  Oh, the Seinfeld, the new season of Seinfeld's coming out.  I saw a commercial for it.  I go, ooh.  And my girlfriend goes, oh, don't buy it.  Put it on the wish list.  I go, no, but I want to watch it the day it comes out.  I'm older.  I have reached an age where instant gratification.  If I see a packet of yodels at a convenience store and it's six in the morning and I want them for breakfast, I'm having yodels for breakfast. 
[00:15:00]  Mommy can't yell at me.  And I love that I've reached that point in my life, the age of millionaire.  That helps, Jimmy.  It helps fulfill that whole thing of I'll get whatever I want.  Yeah, you do make a good point, though.  Because why wait?  You know, why wait?  Why wait?  Why am I going to sit there on December 26th and go, shit, I should have said this. 
[00:15:30]  Now I've got to wait a year before I can get it.  No.  I go to Best Buy.  I go to Circuit City.  I'm picking up my new electronic device.  That's right.  All right.  So we back up.  I'm a fancy man.  We back up.  How was your holiday?  How was the Thanksgiving, Anthony?  It now has just turned into some type of family rerun.  And there's nothing new that happens. 
[00:16:00]  Absolutely nothing new.  That is brilliant, actually.  The family rerun.  It's a rerun.  You could roll videotape.  We could all sit at home.  We should tape one.  Multi-camera shoot.  Just tape it and play it at home where we can just sit there and watch.  Because there is nothing new.  I sit with the same people.  The same conversations happen.  I did step in this time, though, and have to draw a line.  I got angry.  I want no more medical discussions ever, ever in family get-togethers anymore. 
[00:16:30]  I don't care.  When you sit down, and there it is.  The underpast.  The underpast is on the table.  And it's time for everyone to sit down and start digging in.  And then the various courses come on the table just like every fucking year.  And there it is.  And you eat the same stuff.  The same people.  You know, I cooked it.  You cooked it the past 20 years.  I know you make the fucking quiche.  I know you do. 
[00:17:00]  Who made the turkey?  Uncle Tony did.  There he is carving it.  Like every fucking year.  It's the same thing.  It's like you're watching the same movie.  Who watched?  I don't watch Goodfellas that many times.  And I watch it every time it's on.  But I've seen this movie every time for 20, 30 friggin' years.  But sometimes the stars don't re-up for a year or two.  Yeah.  Because they die.  A few of the stars don't come back.  A few of the stars decide not to come back for the sequel.  A few of them are legends.  Right.  You just, they're off the list.  But then I sit there.  And the first, some of these old people show up. 
[00:17:30]  And the first thing out of their mouth.  Did you hear about Doris?  It's a sin.  She was in the hospital.  She had a goiter being removed.  And they found some cancer.  And what they're doing now with her is a new procedure that,  I don't want to hear it.  I'm eating.  I'm eating.  I don't want goiters.  I don't want cancer on the conversation.  No tumors. 
[00:18:00]  I want happy, fun talk.  Just like my turkey, I want it to be tumor-free.  No tumors.  You're talking about tumors eating like a little onion bulb?  Oh, you're eating like a roasted potato.  And, you know, old, you know, one of your old uncles is talking about his prostate  as they're handing over an artichoke.  Does it look like this green and spiky with breadcrumbs embedded in it?  I hate old people.  They just talk about their fucking medical conditions. 
[00:18:30]  I brought this up some other point.  You can't go to a diner without sitting down and listening to table conversation about people's feet  or their breasts or their neck or eyeballs or a brain tumor or throat or thyroid or knees or bones or something.  Can you just talk about the shit on your plate?  Can you talk about one of your young grandchildren that are doing fine that are still healthy? 
[00:19:00]  God bless them.  No.  It's got to be my back hurts.  So I went in and it turns out the tumor is intertwined in my spinal cord.  Oh, lovely.  Hope you die before I come here again next time.  Great.  Pass the gravy, please.  Yeah, could you please just pass the gravy?  And what are you going to do with those coins you saved all those years?  I wouldn't mind having a crack at them.  You know, not that you have to think about that now.  Just so you're ready to go bye-bye on the box. 
[00:19:30]  And the blood clots in my varicose veins.  Could I have the cranberry sauce?  That's what you go through.  It's every year the same thing.  And then, oh, I'm so full.  I've got to sit down for a while.  Watch the football game.  Sit down and fall asleep.  Going to have to unloosen my pants.  Ugh.  I was at my sister's sister-in-law's house the day after Thanksgiving.  And this lady, she's in her mid-50s. 
[00:20:00]  She comes up to me.  First thing she says to me is that she has a sour stomach.  First thing.  First thing.  What possesses them?  Because that's the other thing.  It starts with sour stomachs and this other crap.  And then eventually they get a little older.  And then it's pure medical hell.  Yeah.  But this is where it begins.  It starts maybe with some sour stomach.  It starts in your 50s where you have nothing left to talk about.  So you bring up your sour stomach.  And it goes from sour stomach to removed my esophagus and put my stomach in my back somewhere. 
[00:20:30]  How do you like, I don't know, how do you comment about that?  You know, Lindsay sees her with a piece of apple pie.  Yeah.  And we're just trying to make small talk.  We're in this house.  We don't know anybody really.  Nothing in common with these people.  I know my sister and my brother-in-law, obviously, and a few people that were there.  And then there was a bunch of people I didn't know.  And she sits down with her piece of apple pie.  And Lindsay goes, no, it would be perfect for that apple pie is a nice scoop of that vanilla ice cream that's in the kitchen.  That's a nice opening conversation.  Just want to kind of break the ice with that person. 
[00:21:00]  She goes, oh, no.  Yesterday I had a sour stomach.  Oh, sour stuff.  I'm lactose intolerant.  And that ice cream could be a problem.  Oh, no.  I had a sour stomach yesterday.  And then she goes, but I did sneak a little just before the apple pie.  I hope it doesn't affect my esophagitis.  I hope I don't have to go to the bathroom and leave some stew in the toilet.  Yeah, so lovely.  Yeah, I should have just taken it to that level. 
[00:21:30]  Nice stew dump on Thanksgiving.  Yeah, ice cream gives me the runs, too.  So just take it to the next level with her so she walks away.  I ate ice cream one time.  I sneezed.  I shit my pants.  Hand to God.  Hand to God.  I filled up my shoes with pudding, lady.  You know, sometimes I eat ice cream.  My dick won't get hard to fuck my chick.  I swear to God.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Come back here.  You lactose intolerant egg. 
[00:22:00]  But the problem is you're too nice.  Here's how you deal with the elderly.  You guys understand.  Let's role play.  I'll be Lindsay.  You'll be the old person.  Hey, it looks like you should have some ice cream on that.  Oh, no.  Die.  Oh, no.  Yesterday I had a sour stomach.  Sour stomach.  What is that?  It means you had the liquid shit.  Take a Tums.  Jeez.  Take some Pepto.  And then, so that was the highlight of my Thanksgiving.  Oh, that's the highlight? 
[00:22:30]  Actually, I took everyone out to dinner, to a restaurant for Thanksgiving.  You did?  No home family cooking thing?  No, man.  Everyone bailed and then they started looking at me like I was actually going to cook a turkey.  Cook a turkey in my New York apartment.  Oh, that's good.  I'm calling everyone back going, are you insane?  No.  That's great.  No, I'm not cooking a turkey.  You guys can come to Thanksgiving at my house.  We can watch the parade because it's pretty close to my house.  The mice can baste it with their urine. 
[00:23:00]  And then we'll go out to dinner.  So we went out to dinner.  It was different and it was cool.  Yeah.  Knowing how to clean up and it was great.  Did you have turkey?  Yeah.  Traditional Thanksgiving fare at this restaurant?  Yeah, it was an Italian restaurant, but we had turkey.  Had turkey?  Yeah, they had a little turkey menu.  Wasn't like they brought a whole turkey to the...  Nah, it was family style, all cut up, ready to go.  Yeah, I see.  It's got to be a little traditional.  But I had some of the young'uns at my apartment.  We walked and checked out the parade.  Checked out the floats being blown up the night before. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  A little tradition in my neighborhood.  Oh, watching the floats get blown up?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's right around your neck of the woods.  They're all on their side and half blown up.  And you walk by and go, oh, wow, there's Charlie Brown face down in the gutter.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Must have too much to drink last night, kids.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Fill him up with helium, I guess, and then parade him through the streets the next day.  Yeah.  Isn't that wonderful?  Who gives a shit?  Well, then you play the Thanksgiving Day Parade Lottery. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Who's going to get hit in the head with a big chunk of metal this year?  With a lamppost.  It really is amazing that this is kind of something new.  Because they had a problem, I guess, 97, 98, was it?  97 was the really bad one with the brain damage and all that, some lady.  97.  Just trying to enjoy the parade.  Oh, you just sit there.  How many millions of people sit and watch that?  That is unlucky lottery if there ever was one.  A big clunk of steel hits you in the head.  I believe it was the cat in the hat that year. 
[00:24:30]  Yep.  It was coming down the street, and a gust of wind took it into a light pole,  and the entire pole that the light hangs on snapped off and hit her,  put her in a coma for a while.  She got a nice chunk of change out of New York City.  Oh, yeah, she did.  Well, the new ones, they're not suing.  No, they're not.  That's why you go to the parade.  You're playing the lottery with the parade.  Here's what happened.  The M&M was coming down the street, Opie.  I saw the M&M.  The M&M was coming down the street, and a gust of wind, again, 
[00:25:00]  it hit a light post, but the whole pole didn't come down.  Just the globe.  Now, when you look up at these light globes,  don't they look about the size of a Pepsi bottle or something?  Yeah, sure.  When they're up close on the ground, this thing is giant.  It is really huge.  It's the size of, like, a toilet bowl.  It's massive, and it weighs, like, 35 pounds.  Yeah.  The light fixture.  And it came crashing down, and believe me,  there's no free room where this thing could just hit empty sidewalk. 
[00:25:30]  Every spot is taken by people.  And it hit, apparently, some child from Albany.  Drove down with the family.  Also with a disabled person was with them in one of those motorized wheelchairs.  And it kind of hit that person a little, too.  I heard it just bounced off her head.  Was she a retard?  Yeah, there was something going on there.  I don't know.  Hit her big, soft, pliable, huge, oversized tongue like an airbag. 
[00:26:00]  Cushioned the blow.  It almost knocked some sense into her.  Did she have down?  They probably didn't know she was.  They probably thought she was a float.  Okay.  Big cash.  But they're not suing.  Yeah.  It's noble of them, but, I mean.  But fuck it.  Everyone else is going to sue.  You might as well, too.  It's the Thanksgiving Day Parade Lottery.  Like you said, they have a winning ticket.  You might as well cash it in.  I've got to tell you, I was watching, because that's the first thing you think about when 
[00:26:30]  you're watching the parade from the sidewalk.  Yeah.  How good are these people at controlling the balloons?  You're looking up at what could possibly get knocked off.  The coverage always says they're professionals.  I don't know what that means.  Hell fucking no.  I don't know what that means.  How many floats do they have?  20, 30 maybe?  Yeah.  Whatever.  A couple dozen, let's say.  There's like 50 guys on each one.  They do it once a year.  And from the looks of these people, they're not professionals.  No, they're not getting the cream of the crop. 
[00:27:00]  Apparently, they're going to be joining us for the homeless shopping spree, because that's  exactly what some of these people looked like.  Of course.  And all I heard in my section, and it's the beginning of the parade, this is a good 40 blocks,  excuse me, 30 blocks uptown from where the actual accident happened.  Yeah.  This is all we heard from the crowd and the people.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Really?  Whoa!  As the blues going side to side, I'm like, this ain't good. 
[00:27:30]  This is just a disaster waiting to happen every fucking year.  Weaving back and forth.  But that's all you hear from the crowd is, whoa!  As it's getting too close to their side, and then it goes back to the other side.  Yeah, one of the floats got pretty close to Katie Couric and Matt Lauer and what's his  face there?  Al Roker.  Al Roker, who was sitting there.  And they're doing their report, and then they went like, whoa!  Whoa!  It kind of backed off, because it swung right near him.  That's what the crowd does through the whole thing.  It's just, whoa! 
[00:28:00]  Because they're not controlling shit.  No.  They're on tethers, but the wind is really, they're at the wind's mercy.  And it's New York City streets.  They're not doing this thing on a farm.  You know, there are buildings and plenty of lights and light poles.  Yeah.  Just waiting to get knocked and snagged.  It's so good to see that M&M deflate, though.  Just lay on the ground.  Oh, it's great.  The light pole just falls and hits some stupid family from Albany.  They quickly popped that thing, deflated it, and snuck it off a side road. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Got it on its truck as fast as possible.  Get out of here.  Keep the festivities going.  It wasn't that bad.  Let's get...  Hose down the retard.  More floats are on the way.  We've got to move on.  That's what I saw, too.  I was, I...  I turn on Channel 4 and NBC in New York, and I'm watching the parade coverage, and I'm like,  this is the stupidest shit.  And then I couldn't tune away, because their coverage is so bad.  They're trying so hard to be festive, and the parade moves so slowly that there is a ton 
[00:29:00]  of just inane babble they use for filler.  And I'm watching, and then I'm switching back and forth from CBS to NBC.  I guess ABC had something else going on.  But I'm switching back and forth, and the coverage, just horrid.  They like throwing stats in for all the floats. 
[00:29:30]  They have a...  And here comes Dora the Explorer coming down.  Something new this year, very popular with the children.  I know it's on at my house all the time.  And Dora the Explorer, my kids love it.  And do you know, Dora couldn't catch a subway here.  She's as high as five subway cars.  They've got to throw in, like, a local angle or something to tell you that it's big.  Yeah.  And Chicken Little from the new movie, Chicken Little, doesn't think the sky's falling today  on this beautiful day. 
[00:30:00]  The sky was falling on a family from Albany.  Chicken Little's glasses, by the way, as wide as three taxicab windshields.  Here's another New York tie-in for you.  And Ronald McDonald making his way down.  Ronald McDonald, half as tall as the Statue of Liberty.  We get it.  We get it.  Big balloons.  They're very big.  We get it.  Big, big, big balloons.  You're missing the obvious, though.  After the M&M's float hit the light post and hit that family in Albany, they continue with 
[00:30:30]  the parade like nothing was going on.  Did you see all the shit that was going on behind Katie and Matt and the rest of these  clowns?  They had, and on CBS, their vantage point behind them was exactly where the light fell.  Yeah.  So they're trying their derndest to just go, all right, we'll keep you updated on this,  but moving on with the parade, as we look, here comes a Bullwinkle is coming down the street.  And this is a festive day. 
[00:31:00]  Here's the marching band from Iowa as they're coming down the street.  Somebody help!  Beautiful day, isn't it?  Oh my God!  Why are we all of a sudden in Italy?  Oh my God!  And here comes Santa Claus, ending the parade for the day, as they hose the street down 
[00:31:30]  of blood.  They tried to carry on, but all you saw were emergency vehicles.  Yeah.  People moving very quickly.  Oh, it was quite entertaining.  All right, we got lots of phones.  We do?  Yeah, there's a couple that are interesting.  Oh, I can't see the phones today.  Uh, hold on, I gotta move this over a little.  I don't know what should...  Oh, okay, Tree Killer, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas? 
[00:32:00]  Hey, man.  What do you got today?  Oh, just a holiday disaster.  My, uh, father-in-law confessing an affair right at the Thanksgiving table.  Happy holidays.  Stop.  Yeah, that's the other thing about Thanksgiving, man.  People confess all sorts of shit.  You got a little booze in them?  Yeah, a little drunked up and, uh, I don't know, just blurted it out and kind of had  to sit there and didn't even get the pie.  We kind of left early, you know.  Is he having it now or it was a previous affair?  Previous. 
[00:32:30]  Recently over, I guess.  Yeah, well, why would you bring it up, then?  I don't know.  I couldn't tell you.  Is the stepmother alive still?  Oh, yeah.  Right beside him.  Oh, right beside him.  All right.  That's great.  Well, thank you for that.  Hey, no problem.  I thought there was a little more to it, but, uh, all right.  Father-in-law confesses, uh, to an affair at Thanksgiving.  Nope.  No confessions.  Have a good one.  You know what, then?  And then I get people like, uh, relatives that come up and go, do you remember me? 
[00:33:00]  Like, now it's a fucking quiz that if I fail, I'm the asshole.  Because I can't remember your name.  First of all, you look nothing like you used to, okay?  I haven't seen you in, uh, I don't know, 30 years.  And they come up, do you remember me, darling?  No.  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  I remember nothing about you.  I thought you died in 1979.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like a guest star.  Right.  They pop in. 
[00:33:30]  I got my regulars.  I know who they are.  I see them every year.  And then there's, uh, this extra relative that comes by and quizzes me.  Right.  And makes me feel like an idiot.  Yeah.  And then I go, yeah, I remember.  What's thy name, darling?  What's my name?  Oh, okay.  I don't know who you are.  Annoying cunt.  How's that for a name?  Hey, Mike in Philly, what's up?  How's it going?  Uh, pretty good, Mike.  A couple years ago, my buddy was working for Marvel Comics, so we held a Spider-Man float.  And the night before, the guy not drinking was hammered. 
[00:34:00]  He was throwing up on the way in.  So those people out hold those floats are not experts.  Yeah, of course not.  I hear they're employees of Macy's.  I hear they're trained maybe for a couple weeks.  Yeah.  Most of the guys not taking it, uh, seriously, and they're drinking the night before.  Of course.  I've heard all the horror stories.  Thanks, Mike.  Do you guys hear an echo on the phone?  Yeah, a little bit.  Okay.  A little bit.  It's been worse.  I'll give them that.  It's not bad.  Knock woods.  Two weeks training.  It's going to be working.  Employees. 
[00:34:30]  Okay, we covered all that.  All right, so.  I had an exciting, no one asked me how my Thanksgiving was.  Well, we're going to ask you after the break.  I want to know.  But guys, it's a holiday for friends.  I saw Pat from Munaki's Thanksgiving up on a message board.  What do you mean?  He actually took a picture of his plate and the Boston Market bag, and it's a plate with  a leg, some mashed potatoes, and some gravy, and I think there was some cranberry sauce  or something on the side and corn, he actually sat there with his Boston Market Thanksgiving. 
[00:35:00]  How do we know it was actually Thanksgiving, though?  Did he have the parade on in the background or something?  I believe him.  I totally believe him.  Yeah, we learned way too much about Pat on our last show before today.  Pat was like, and I gave him a thought, like as I was sitting there with my family, for  some reason there was an empty seat and plate, because I guess we'd overestimated how many 
[00:35:30]  people were going to be there, and there was one missing plate, and my girlfriend goes,  that is the Pat from Munaki plate.  We could have invited Pat.  He could have sat at the table, the plate.  And then, like, food started coming, and I gave it not another thought.  I just forgot about Pat.  I forgot that fat diabetic existed until you just brought his name up.  So I'm thinking now maybe we should do something for him for Christmas.  Well, he's going to be a big star this coming Friday when we're back in New York. 
[00:36:00]  We're doing the eggnog drinking contest this Friday.  Are we doing well with the contestants at all?  We've got a bunch of truckers, and they're going to come all the way to New York to take  on Pat and see if they could outdrink him in the eggnog drinking contest.  I put my money on Pat.  I am definitely putting my money on Pat.  He blew the competition away so badly last year that I can't see anyone beating him.  70 double shots of eggnog last year.  He kept drinking after everyone else, long after everyone else had bailed out. 
[00:36:30]  And he finally stopped on his own and then made himself puke.  He could have kept going.  Yeah.  He could have kept going.  So good luck to these truckers who think they could take Pat out.  They're all coming in Friday.  Friday show is going to be just a puke fest.  How about for Christmas we get him a nice, maybe a $50 gift certificate to Boston Market  so he can get himself like something, a bigger plate.  Some cyanide.  You know what?  I think there's going to be a lot of listeners outside the studio on Friday because I think  we're going to maybe drag one last contestant off the street just in case like all the guys 
[00:37:00]  that said they're showing don't show.  We want to fill up the studio with contestants.  I think if you're coming by the station on Friday, please bring a gift for Pat.  A very Pat from Unaki Christmas.  Yes, yes.  Pat needs gifts.  Because he doesn't get, we learned that he doesn't have any family.  He's got a couple of family members but they don't accept him.  He has no contact with him.  He has a sister whose husband seems to hate Pat for some reason that he's been very vague 
[00:37:30]  about and the sister doesn't have any contact I guess because her husband can't stand Pat.  Pat's got a father who abandoned him when he was born that Pat knows where he lives.  Guaranteed he's driven by the house.  He's called him a couple of times but hangs up when he picks up the phone.  So there's a want there, a need to know who his father is.  You think he's driven by the house just as the front door is opening and his two new young  kids are running toward the minivan for soccer practice. 
[00:38:00]  Hustling their little hair.  And everyone's just happy, running.  Have a good day, Skipper Champ.  Maybe getting, you know, maybe just slightly late for the soccer game.  So they're rushing but they're happy.  Bye daddy, we love you.  I love you too, kids.  Jumping into the minivan as Pat's van is slowly driving by in the distance.  The brand new minivan they hop in as Pat's tranny is falling out in front of the house.  The beautiful house, by the way.  You know it's just the white picket fence. 
[00:38:30]  Everything Pat's ever wanted in a family is in that house and that's it.  It's a house full of love.  A house full of love.  Can we tease your Thanksgiving going into break?  Oh, it's not that eventful.  I just was lonely.  He was lonely.  Oh, you didn't do anything for Thanksgiving?  I did.  I saw somebody with nothing major.  You saw somebody?  You saw a hooker for Thanksgiving?  No.  I mean, I didn't even go on.  Did you or did you not get an escort for Thanksgiving?  I do not believe I did. 
[00:39:00]  But you had a friend?  You weren't alone?  No.  With a Boston Market chicken leg?  Pat even looks like a baby.  He looks like just a taller version of what his father walked away from.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, Dad.  Well, maybe me and you could slam.  What's the dial tone noise?  Just at the door, all nervous, a half hour before he can bring himself and work up the nerve to knock. 
[00:39:30]  Who are you?  I'm your son, Daddy.  Whack.  Just staring at that knocker on the door.  I'll bet you he says things when he drives by the house.  He probably goes, how are you doing today, Dad?  You know, just trying to be kind of funny to himself.  Hey, Dad.  There it is.  Portia in the driveway.  Fight the urge to just blubber.  Successful businessman.  Portia, new young wife.  Oh, just the hottest wife is walking out.  Two young, perfect model kids. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, God.  And you know Christmas at that house?  Oh, the living room has a vaulted ceiling where they can fit an 18-foot Christmas tree in there.  And they all laugh as they decorate it up.  Presents just stacked and out so far from the bottom of the tree with the kids' names on it.  Everything they could possibly want and more.  And dinner?  Oh, the new family is just over there. 
[00:40:30]  They've got to put like four leaves in the table to extend it to fit that entire family.  And they have plenty of sugary desserts because their kids don't have diabetes.  None of their kids have diabetes.  All ten toes.  Their kids aren't going to embarrass them by stuffing newspaper where that little toe should be so they don't tip over.  Just the happiest Christmas ever.  Every Nathan's contest, it's just more love.  Just put more love. 
[00:41:00]  Put more love in that gaping hole.  Give me more love.  More love.  More love.  Oh, how horrid.  I can't wait to see Pat from Monocle this Friday.  The Egg Guy Drinking Contest.  So, you know, yeah, maybe a wrapped little present for them.  It would be very, very nice.  It would be good.  Because I know a lot of you guys are going to show up on Friday, so that would be very, very nice.  Yeah.  All right, well, did you have turkey for Thanksgiving, Jimmy?  I did.  And?  It was good.  I didn't cook it, though.  Who cooked it?  Bob Kelly's girlfriend. 
[00:41:30]  You hung out with Bob Kelly and his girlfriend?  Holiday with Bob Kelly.  Ugh.  I had to.  I was working.  I would have wanted to see my family.  I'll see my family this week.  I want a leg, man.  Hold my wing.  I'm telling you, he actually looks like a turkey now.  That awful body is just sitting there with his little fat legs sticking straight out,  his short arms almost reaching his mouth.  All right.  The other thing, really fast, we're watching the local news down here in Washington.  If you haven't figured it out yet, if you're just tuning in, we're doing the show from Washington, D.C. the next couple of days. 
[00:42:00]  And they just had a story on the pan dog.  Oh, it is the cutest little thing.  I think it could be cuter than the puggle.  It looked like...  The puggle was all the rage, what, two weeks ago?  Two weeks ago.  Now all the people that got the puggles, they're going to kick them out to the backyard and they're going to get these new pan dogs.  Pan dogs.  Yeah, the puggles are going to be in burlap bags with rocks headed toward the river. 
[00:42:30]  A little barking bag right over the side of that boat.  Glub, glub.  Your yesterday's news, beat it stupid.  Or, of course, my favorite, Jimmy's solution, the old pillowcase and the ball peen hammer.  Wrap that little devil up, maybe in a towel or a pillowcase and just beat it until it stops.  It's not so much the movement or the sound.  You just don't want to look into those eyes.  Those why are you hurting me eyes. 
[00:43:00]  What are you doing?  You loved me a week ago.  How do you tell a puggle you're so September?  Oh, here you go, puggle.  And back we go.  Back we go to my pan dog.  What's the pan dog about?  It's part panda.  They don't know if it's a panda or a dog.  That's what the graphic said.  I don't know how they figured this out.  Is it a panda or is it a dog?  They took a white dog that almost looked like some kind of bichon or a poodle type thing. 
[00:43:30]  A lot of white fluff.  But around its eyes and nose was black like a cute little panda.  And they looked like little pandas.  It was simply adorable.  The cutest little dog I've ever seen.  It was the cute story on the news today.  They came back to the anchors and the anchors had that look on their face.  Where do I get one?  They were just, they couldn't believe how adorable this little dog was. 
[00:44:00]  You know there's got to be something wrong with these cute dogs.  We've brought this up in the past.  The puggles and the pan dogs.  Some kind of genetic disaster they're making.  There's got to be something.  Well, you're looking at it as actually the product of a dog rape.  Some panda saw a dog and just raped it.  You think a dog gave pussy to a panda?  It was taken.  I bet you all those cute dogs suffer from sour stomachs.  Some kind of conglomerated.  Malata.  Mongrel racer dog. 
[00:44:30]  There he is.  Oh, look at this.  What is it?  Looks like a slipper.  What a nice feeling.  Looks like a baby panda.  It's a pan dog.  And it is adorable.  I just want to grab it by the feet and smash it against the wall and sell its pelt.  Jesus.  We're very angry today.  And then they did it with a club on an ice float.  And then they finished the cutesy story and they moved on to the next story.  Yeah.  Oh, that pan dog.  You know, I'm going to get one for the holidays. 
[00:45:00]  In Iowa, a bus accident claimed 20 lives as it flew over an embankment.  What about the pan dog?  I was just all jolly and smiling from the pan dog.  Now I've got to be sad again because you told me I have to be sad.  You're kidding.  In other news, a pregnant woman lost her life with her husband as she rolled out of a van  in the middle of Arizona.  Malata was enjoying the pan dog.  Another restraining order that didn't work as a husband brutally murders his wife. 
[00:45:30]  Pan dog.  Pan dog.  Just looking at a cute pan dog.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  Well, we're just getting started here, huh?  Just getting started.  On the way.  We only heard a piece of this, but it's an anti-gay short film targeted at teenage boys.  Where the hell does Steve find this shit?  It's one of those films from the olden days when they had sense and actually put these  films out to teach the youth of America about things like homosexuality and dating and girls 
[00:46:00]  teach you about your menstrual cycle.  It's all those old educational films.  I love them.  Yes.  I saw a few yesterday.  I went over to that American History Museum.  You know, Washington's full of museums.  Well, why don't we stop right there?  We'll talk about your museum experience.  We'll talk about this film we found.  And I have an answer to your question, by the way.  What question?  I know the answer to your question.  What question?  Where did Steve find all these things?  Yeah, where? 
[00:46:30]  They're from childhood when mother and father would sit him down and make him watch these  anti-gay things.  Stop talking like that.  I can't help it, mother.  I can't help it, mother.  Mother.  Any guy that calls his mom mother.  There is just a problem there.  Stop it, mother.  Mother.  There's nothing wrong with the way I talk.  It's not effeminate. 
[00:47:00]  Also, Space Hitler taking on a life of its own, Anthony.  I love Space Hitler.  We'll explain that.  We were talking about the Dickie Goodman remixes.  Remember Mr. Jaws we played last week?  We asked the listeners to make their own.  We have five that came in.  Oh, you know what else about the Thanksgiving Day parade?  I couldn't believe it.  On NBC's coverage, which was right outside of Macy's, I guess, they had the vantage point  where they'd have the floats and the musical numbers would take place and then the float 
[00:47:30]  would leave.  So they had musical numbers.  And they did, like, Disney things and stuff like that.  It was all lip synced, so it looked ridiculous.  But one of them was a float with a big Egyptian pyramid-like thing.  Oh, where they were having sex?  No.  You didn't see that one?  I didn't see that one.  Or, like, dirty dancing on the top?  Maybe later on.  Oh, the mountain climbers were on a sphinx-looking thing.  Yeah, yeah.  This was different.  All right, sorry.  Go ahead.  It was an obelisk and some kind of other Egyptian thing. 
[00:48:00]  A what?  Obelisk.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's like some kind of big thing.  Oblong-ish thing?  Yeah.  It's a monument-type thing.  Oblong-ish thing?  Yeah.  And they had a guy, and he sang Steve Martin's King Tut.  Oh, yeah.  No, he didn't.  I did see that.  Dude, I was stuck.  And the day before we had played that goofing on how completely awful it was, and there 
[00:48:30]  it was, right before my eyes, the King Tut song.  I bet people were laughing.  Oh, just loving it.  Especially uptown, when they see King Tut, and then you realize, wow, they really just  whitened him up.  Wasn't he black at one point?  He's my favorite honky.  What?  He wasn't white.  He wasn't white?  What's with the honky reference?  Buried with a donkey?  Why?  What a corn boy.  Was he?  I doubt it.  Hold on now.  This segues into Cheaper by the Dozen someday. 
[00:49:00]  So, from really edgy to really edgy.  Comedy Central should be firebombed for naming him the sixth greatest comedian of all time.  Are you out of your fucking minds?  Please.  Dream come true.  A real arrow through his head.  There you go.  With that, why don't we take our first break?  We have lots to do.  We just don't know how to organize it yet, so.  Yeah.  That's what we do now.  Stay there.  Move.  What makes that kid mad?  What makes them do the things they do?  Here he comes.  Live.  That's right.  From Crackdown, USA.  It's a joke. 
[00:49:30]  Deep in the heart of Washington, D.C.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Quote, drive safely.  Unquote.  Isn't that lovely?  Let's make a party out of it.  Right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Famous.  Get infected.  Hey, we should get into what happened to Aerie Spears, because we defended you, bro.  Thank you, bro.  We got audio of the whole thing, and we thought those guys down in Miami.  Oh, this guy.  Yeah, you know. 
[00:50:00]  A bunch of pussy.  Oh.  What are their names?  I might have did their shows.  Yeah, what is it?  I know.  Ron and...  Ron and Paul.  Paul, I think they did.  I did those guys.  He's one of that big guy?  Yeah.  That was one of the fucking shit.  He's a big guy, right?  Look, I don't know much about that jock.  You never see that.  I know.  I don't know much about him, but as far as the situation goes, they looked really bad.  You know what's crazy, man?  It's like they...  And you know how the radio is, man.  You can kind of be at the helm and edit shit and control shit.  So they would always push the button where, like, they would have...  Because I said this thing where I said, look, man, I'm from New York. 
[00:50:30]  So they just kept pushing the button, and people would, like, kind of make fun of them.  What does that mean?  I'm from New York.  And my whole thing with that was I was just trying to let him know I'm not from Florida, man.  I'm not from one of these little pussy towns where you're just going to talk crazy about me,  and I ain't going to come do nothing.  So when I made that statement, I was saying that to say, look, man, this is where I'm from.  I'm proud of that.  This is part of, you know, my character.  And we don't, you know, we don't get down like that.  You know what I mean?  And it's just...  But are you from Michigan?  From where?  This motherfucker.  I hate you, ass.  So, you know, it just was an interview went bad, man. 
[00:51:00]  So they talked shit as soon as you left the studio?  As soon as I left, I got in the car, and I, you know, we're listening to the station,  and they just start ripping into me.  And I probably got about two blocks, and I told the driver, I said, man, turn this shit around.  That's awesome.  Say it exactly how, like, that made you want to come back.  Well, when he was like, you know, I said, yeah, man, I did the thing at the hip-hop station,  had a good time.  He goes, go back to your hippity-dippity-rippity-rappity station where they got, you know, six listeners 
[00:51:30]  and do your thing.  And when he was saying that, he was going, you hippity-dippity, you know, he was doing  all that shit.  What did he say to you in the car that made you go, nigga, turn this motherfucker up?  Oh, he said, he said, who does he think he is to come into my station in my city and  not do what I asked him to do?  That's what it was.  There you go.  All right.  See, this is what we have to explain to white people.  This is good.  They missed out on that.  But the white people, I have a PhD in white people.  They did not understand that you don't do that as a white guy. 
[00:52:00]  You don't show it to slave masters, mom.  But again, you do what I told you to do.  And last one made him go back.  Aaron was bullshitting.  He tried to make it sound like he said, nigga, I'll shoot you in your motherfucking eye.  He just said, let me tell you something, boy.  That shit went right to his DNA, man.  Right to his DNA.  We had put the sand down on the floor for a little soft shoe and he didn't deliver.  He didn't deliver.  God damn it, we had makeup and everything.  Oh, my job. 
[00:52:30]  You want him to say mammy and you be saying mammy when I say say mammy.  My studio.  This is my plantation.  I'm out of my studio.  And I say.  That's what it was, Amy.  Holy shit.  All right.  All right.  That's it.  Aaron was trying to make it sound like he said, well, I'll smack you up inside your motherfucking  head, boy.  But he was just like, he just should come here and do it.  He's told.  That's when that car made that U-E.  All right.  Let's go.  That car turned around like when they were taking Michael to the restaurant. 
[00:53:00]  Good driving, Lou.  Good driving, Lou.  What are you doing?  Not Luke DeBrossey.  All the guy.  We going to Brooklyn?  Are we going to Jersey?  Yeah.  We'll see where we go.  That's great.  Makes that turn.  Let's get back to the tape here.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  It's amazing.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program broadcasting live from the XM compound down  here in Washington, D.C. for a couple of days.  I was talking to Anthony about the PSP.  Love it.  I got all the gaming systems now.  I got the Nintendo DS.  I got the Game Boy Advance.  I got the PSP.  Oh, yeah.  And I took the PSP for the ride from New York to Washington on the train. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Holy crap.  Holy crap.  Why couldn't they invent this?  Why couldn't they?  Why couldn't they?  Why couldn't they?  Travel's going to be a breeze now because we have to do a lot of traveling with this job.  Yeah.  And a lot of times, you know, I get bored watching the movies on the planes and I bring my own DVD player and all that, but after a while, it's like, ah, I've seen all this shit, you know?  But gaming, gaming on a plane or on a train with the commute, forget it.  That's where it's at. 
[00:54:30]  So, my PSP's on the way?  No.  No, because you're not going to use it.  Why didn't Jimmy get one?  Because he's not going to use it.  So what?  Yes, I had to put my fist down, finally.  We gave you a Black...  Look, he's actually getting mad.  We gave you a BlackBerry.  You didn't use that.  So what?  Because they tied it to my XM account.  But you wanted the BlackBerry.  You needed the BlackBerry.  I know they should have given me one.  And now it's just sitting there as a doorstop or something in your apartment.  So what?  It's in LA, actually.  My BlackBerry is the most useless thing.  I never use it.  I wanted it because I figured you could do email and do all that texting, but it's only going to my XM account, which I don't use. 
[00:55:00]  It's like, I didn't know that when they gave it to me.  All right, well.  Nope.  Well, ask Don.  He's right there.  I use my phone.  But the PSP is great.  Someone who listens to Toto shouldn't get a PSP.  Listen, Pai.  Toto.  There's nothing wrong with...  Listening to Toto, I happen to like the song Rosanna, and I like the song Africa.  Oh.  What?  Rosanna.  That one?  Yeah, of course. 
[00:55:30]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  I told Lindsay that I hate traveling with you, by the way.  Why?  Because she's laughing.  She thinks you're the funniest guy in the world.  And I'm like, it's not funny.  See, you're still kind of new to this game.  I've been traveling with Jimmy for years, and it's not fun anymore.  Oh, it's hilarious.  We're walking through the train station, and he's singing Tanya Yellow Ribbon.  Oh, yeah.  On that old oak tree.  I just have my headphones on.  Sometimes you forget.  As loud as he can.  And you're singing that song. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, it's hilarious as you listen to this wherever you listen to the show.  But when you're right next to him, and you've been through this year after fucking year,  and everyone's turning around, wants to shut the retard up, and they're really pissed,  but no one's brave enough to sing anything.  And there he is.  Tanya Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree.  It's been three long years.  I gotta be occupied when I'm on the road.  That's the problem.  I get too antsy.  That's why a PS2 would be very helpful. 
[00:56:30]  Ants in your pants, and they make you dance.  That's how you are.  Yeah.  You need distractions.  Yeah.  Elo has 15 minutes now, then, meetings.  Oh, you want to come in and say hi?  Yeah.  All right.  Elo wanted to welcome us to the XM compound.  Elo's only got 15 minutes.  Look at this guy.  When he's down here, it's all about working, meetings, keeping this ship just on course.  I don't need a mic condom. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  It's for your protection.  It's for my protection.  He's got the perfect radio voice.  We need all the bells and whistles to make ourselves sound good.  You know, I used to practice that crap, you know, when you're like, you'd sit and listen  to yourself in a production room, and you're like, trying to force your voice low, and  drink whiskey until two in the morning, and be hungover.  I was trying to be that broadcaster.  The boss job.  Yeah.  I was trying to be the perfect broadcaster where I pronounce everything perfectly, and  I would practice and do all that. 
[00:57:30]  And then I met...  Enunciate?  Well, then I met Brother Weez in Rochester, and this guy has no business being on the radio  if you listen to his voice.  Yeah, absolutely right.  And I went...  How's Weez doing, by the way?  And I went, yes!  And then I took it another way with this whole thing.  Huh?  How's he doing, by the way?  He's doing great.  Good.  Yeah, I love that guy.  He had cancer treatment done, and he's tumor-free.  Where are we?  Speaking at the Thanksgiving table?  Jesus Christ.  Hey, man, he's a tough one, though, man.  He took 30 radiation treatments to his noggin. 
[00:58:00]  To the face.  To the front of the face, and he came through it fine.  God bless him.  That's right, Anthony.  That's what I say.  God bless him.  Well, Jimmy, I did not print out the agenda for you, but there is an agenda for the day.  Yeah, there's after-show meetings.  There's show meetings all day.  Cool.  But I didn't print it out for you.  Why?  I want it to be a surprise to you as the day unfolds.  So when we're done here today at 11 o'clock Eastern, what do we do? 
[00:58:30]  11 o'clock Hawaii time, possibly.  No, no, no.  He's saying done here, meaning the show.  When we're done here, we're doing the show.  Oh, I got it.  See, then where do we go?  See, Eric, you might not know this, but we broadcast until 11 a.m.  Well, I'm not really sure.  I catch the replays like everybody else.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just heard my radio on, and there you are.  When we say thank you, good night, we'll see you tomorrow, then what happens?  Holy crap, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven meetings happen.  Yeah.  Let me see what version that is, though. 
[00:59:00]  Actually, it's been updated.  Oh, it's been updated?  Yes.  I actually added the video.  I hope you cross it with you off.  Let's see here.  And Anthony, it's brave of you to say nope, but the last meeting is Eric Logan to make  sure we stay here.  Oh, no.  What, do we got to meet with the guy that vacuums on this list?  Well, here you go.  You can read the list.  I didn't put the HR meeting on there by design because I knew Jimmy would not believe it.  All right.  Arrival date.  How was the arrival, by the way?  I mean, I heard you went to a few museums. 
[00:59:30]  It was perfect.  Yeah, I got in a Saturday.  I drove.  You drove down?  Yeah, I drove.  It's a nice drive.  Oh, it's a nice drive when there's no traffic, I assume, when you're sitting in seven hours  of nonstop traffic the whole way down.  Dude, you can't leave Saturday afternoon on a Long Island, man.  Well, you can't leave and expect to come to D.C. and not get killed.  You know, I figured Saturday at, like, noonish, one o'clock.  Oh, my God.  What?  Mall traffic.  Yes.  It's the biggest shopping day of the year.  Well, there were no malls where there was traffic. 
[01:00:00]  There certainly is.  First of all, you got that goddamn, uh, uh, the, uh, uh, because they take up a lane  to get off.  Jersey Turnpike Merge.  That merge has to, who's the engineering marvel that came up with that?  His head should be on a spike at that merge.  Whoever thought up, uh, we got the truck lane and the car lane, which is a great idea.  And at one point, we're just going to slam them both together so that from now until  flying car is invented, there will be traffic here at this spot. 
[01:00:30]  His head on a spike.  So when you finally get through it, you can go, salute.  Thanks for nothing.  That was it.  And then the rest of the way down, just stop and go, stop and go the whole time for no  reason.  And then it would just open up.  For no reason.  Merging.  Merging.  Getting off the highway to go to the local mall.  It took a while.  But then we got here and everything was fine.  The hotel's great.  And then, uh, uh, we decided to go to the museums, you know, uh, yesterday.  It is your nation's capital. 
[01:01:00]  You should enjoy it.  I love my nation's capital.  Uh, let's see though.  Monday, we got, uh, pickups at the various hotels.  Obviously that happened.  Yes, it did.  It went very well.  It's been perfect so far.  It went very well, uh, aside from, uh, Don Wicklund driving like a maniac, like he says.  Ooh, look out for Wickie behind the wheel.  Opie did nothing but goofed on Don the entire time.  And Don said, I drive like a maniac.  We'll get there in record time.  No, because I, we're driving up to the first traffic circle and it's a yellow light. 
[01:01:30]  Yellow light.  He rams through it.  Long yellow.  No.  No, he stops.  He stops.  What?  And Opie just hopped on it, jumped on it right away.  Like, Ooh, you're a maniac.  Stopping for that yellow.  I go, what are you doing?  He goes, don't worry.  I'm a maniac.  I'm like, well, the first chance.  Oh, don't worry.  I go right through those greens.  I go, I go.  No, that's how it started though.  I'm like, what the hell are you doing?  It was a very long yellow and he jams on the brakes to make sure.  He goes, ah, I don't want to get a ticket here. 
[01:02:00]  I'm like, you're not getting the ticket here.  It goes 530 in the morning.  Yeah.  There's no traffic.  And then he goes, uh, don't worry.  I'll get you there.  I'm a maniac driver.  I'm like, dude, your first chance to prove to me and Anthony that you're a maniac, you  stopped at a yellow light.  Maniacs don't buckle up and worry about a ticket.  They barrel through and don't give a shit.  That's the definition of maniac.  There's no such thing as a responsible maniac.  As you're drinking a six pack.  I'm nuts, Lockydore.  I'm a maniac.  55 saves lives. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, I'll tell you one thing.  Sometimes someone's in my way.  I'll honk right at him.  I'm not driven with improper tire pressure.  You call me nuts.  So I just blast him pretty bad, actually.  He was not happy.  So we had his Mr. Toad's wild ride over here to the studio.  By the way, the longest ride from the hotel to the XM compound ever.  And we've been coming here for a while now.  No, I drove here.  I don't even know.  I'm starting to understand the neighborhoods down here. 
[01:03:00]  Right.  So am I.  I'm like, what are you doing?  He says there's a problem with left turns.  Now, when I drove here, I have to pass, in order to get to the hotel, I have to pass the XM facility.  Right.  I look at my nav system.  It says two miles to go.  So the hotel is two miles from the studio.  Shouldn't take you more than eight to ten minutes.  At the most.  At the most.  At the most.  Because if you think 60 miles an hour, that's two minutes. 
[01:03:30]  That's the way I drive.  It's a two-minute drive.  But old wacky Wicklin, just driving that car, burning rubber off of there.  Where is that nut?  I hope there's a pit crew just for his car to change up the tires after every time he drives.  He must just rub all the rubber off of there.  He was concerned about the franchise.  Is that it?  He was trying to protect the franchise.  You know, you're on to something, because I noticed we didn't have to drive through the ghetto.  Yeah, see? 
[01:04:00]  Now, the first times we were driving here, it would take us twice as long as it did with Don.  Don took a good way.  It didn't take that long.  Don took what's called the white route.  Oh, was that it?  Or the root.  Some people say root.  I say route.  I don't think that's the part that he questioned.  Yeah, that wasn't really.  Your pronunciation of root and route, I've heard before.  The white thing.  Yeah, we weren't, there was no shootings.  There was no shootings this time around.  Last time, we had a shooting.  Yeah, well documented that Megan, who was driving the Opie and Anthony van one time from the hotel to the compound, 
[01:04:30]  we yelled, oh my God, there's a shootout.  And instead of her, like, you know, hitting the gas, she decides to slow down.  Just on the brakes to take a look.  When you see a convenience store parking lot with cop cars parked all askew, and officers are using their cars as what they call cover,  keep going.  Keep going.  Nothing to see here.  Don't stop.  And you can probably go through the red light, because I don't think the cop's going to leave the shootout to write you up a ticket for going through a light. 
[01:05:00]  And Don Wicklund would have gone through that light.  No, he would have stopped.  He's crazy.  He's tough.  He's so crazy, he would have arrested the guy, and still got his ear on time.  Call him Crazy Donnie.  The way he drives.  And I even said that to him, like, aren't you an ex-trooper?  Yeah, apparently he's an ex-stady.  They're going to cut you a little slack.  Go through the fucking yellow.  You tell him, I used to be on the job.  I'm out on a mental.  I'm crazy.  I've shot people.  Don is a kook. 
[01:05:30]  When you look at Don, he's nuts.  He's a crazy person.  He doesn't look like a nut.  He looks like a gentle, sweet guy, but there is a sociopath under that.  I'm telling you.  And that is the craziest crazy person.  Because the guy that looks like a nut, you know to avoid.  The guy that smiles and asks if you need something and then chokes you with piano wire, that's Don.  That's right.  That's funny.  All right, so we get here.  Everything's fine.  Breakfast was adequate.  Sure thing.  All right, we do the show.  Now, meetings with XM execs immediately following. 
[01:06:00]  So here we go.  Here we go.  Oh, we get from 11 to 11.30 is our free time.  That's your free time.  The study hall.  Don't spend it all in the same place.  You know Anthony hated high school.  Yeah, this looks like a schedule.  This is just like high school.  This looks like a schedule.  This is a high school schedule.  And it is because...  What period are we into right now?  Right now?  Right now...  Is this homeroom?  This is homeroom.  Yeah, this is homeroom.  First period starts at 11.30.  Yeah, no, he's right.  Because homeroom was kind of fun.  It was all right.  Yeah, hanging with your friends. 
[01:06:30]  You all have kind of close names.  They all start with the same letter.  A through W over here.  Yeah, was your homeroom like that?  I don't know if we had actual homerooms.  It was all like alphabetical.  Oh, yeah.  So I had people, you know...  Adams through Charlie over here.  Yeah.  I had like Becker through me.  Yeah.  That was like the last one in the C's.  And then it went to D.  11.30 to 12.00 noon, we had a meeting with Tony and Ed.  Update on 57th Street Changeover.  This I like.  There you go. 
[01:07:00]  This I like.  This is a meeting about...  This is progress.  ...getting those goddamn cubicles out of our space in New York City.  There you go.  And starting to make it our own.  Well, then the part you don't see is the budget part, which is a whole other thing.  Oh, we'll be talking budget?  Yeah.  Wow, I can't wait.  There you go.  That Ed's a cut-up, though.  I like talking to him.  Of course.  We love him, actually.  You know, he is funny, though.  We love that guy.  We just want him on the radio.  He actually is a terrific guy.  He won't come on the radio.  He won't go on the radio.  Why?  He's an off-air guy. 
[01:07:30]  We know he's a funny guy, but you're basing that funniness on a curve of all of XM employees.  That's a good point.  Which really, you know, kind of brings it down.  That's right.  He's considered funny because he's living.  So we're getting rid of the dead weight when?  Dead weight for, oh, up in New York.  It's not dead weight.  Those are quality people.  They put together terrific channels.  I love this guy.  He's perfect.  They're quality people.  Quality people.  Quality channel.  Right up until you scroll your BlackBerry down to that XM email that he sends about, 
[01:08:00]  do not talk to this person.  He is gone.  If you see this person in the compound, ignore them.  He's gone to him.  Call security immediately.  He was fired Tuesday.  Jesus.  But he was a quality person.  Quality person.  That's right.  Do you ever call?  Go ahead.  Now, did you really say call security if the so-and-so shows back up like you're afraid?  Well, there are some times when people don't agree with this.  Yeah, his job is tough, man.  He's got to like... 
[01:08:30]  So then I usually have like people hovering, you know, like in the area.  Well, if someone doesn't leave, we have to, you know, ask them through various means,  force included, to leave the premises.  Have they really not wanted to leave?  There's been some people who have just loved working here.  Yeah.  It's a great place to be.  Oh, is that it?  That they love working here so much that...  We just don't want to leave.  Being fired is...  Going back to my Buffalo days, we had a takeover where the rock station we were competing against,  hardcore, bought our station. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, those are fun.  So everyone was fired.  Yep.  And they brought us upstairs to a conference room, closed all the doors, and they fired  all of us, right?  Everyone's been through this if you've been in radio.  And then we go down and get our stuff, and what's waiting for us is armed guards.  Armed guards with weapons.  Like, don't touch our CDs and our crap.  They didn't want us touching anything.  I'll tell you.  I mean, I've actually had to do one of those meetings before.  And in one of my most recent jobs before here, when I resigned from a very, very big company, 
[01:09:30]  huge company.  Yeah.  When I walked in and resigned...  Yeah, the stock is huge, too.  Jesus Christ.  Not that one.  Another one.  Oh, the other huge one.  Oh, the other one.  I said...  I resigned.  They said, fine.  They walked in.  They said, would you please stand up?  They actually personally escorted me out of the building, took my card key, and it wouldn't  let me touch the computer or anything.  I was not thrown out.  I was not thrown out.  I was escorted.  They escorted me out.  I saw the PD at the station in Buffalo.  He went for his keyboard, and there was an armed guard pretty much right next to the 
[01:10:00]  keyboard going, I wouldn't do that.  Was he going to shoot you?  I don't know, but his arm...  Well, they want to bring up that DOS prompt and type F disk, you know, and then away you  go.  The only thing they didn't care about was the prize closet, and that's where I headed.  Oh, really?  Oh, dude.  I made out swag.  I was just like, just slamming it all into my book bags.  Maybe it's your approach, Hilo.  Is it?  It would be great if this worked.  That was good.  Maybe that's his approach. 
[01:10:30]  He's quiet.  He's quiet?  No, it's not working.  What happened to my instant replay?  I saw it, though.  It looked great.  Oh, Derek.  Oh, Derek screwed up?  See, I'm not allowed...  I can't push any buttons from Washington D.C.  You're fired!  I was going to do that.  Maybe it's your approach.  You're fired!  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that.  But he didn't have it up.  So, anyways...  Don't ever call us quality people.  I would never say that about this show.  Thank you, Eric.  Okay, 11.30 to noon.  We got that meeting about the 57th Street changeover. 
[01:11:00]  That, I will be involved in.  That's great.  That's a good meeting.  Because the dead weight's going to be out of there soon, and we're going to have the place  to ourselves.  Noon to 12.30, lunch.  I'm feeling a lunch thing is building into something I'm not happy with.  The first couple of times...  Well, last time you had a problem with the working lunch.  You said there's no such thing as working lunches, so we got rid of the working lunch.  Yeah, but it's almost turning into a meet-and-greet type thing up there.  Because now, this is during lunchtime, obviously.  Noon to 12.30.  Right.  So now we've got to sit there, and again, like high school, it's cliques. 
[01:11:30]  It's little groups.  So, like, the 60s, the decades channel people sit with each other.  The country people.  The country people.  The rock people.  And they all whisper and look and despise us.  Squires his eyes in the country.  Yeah, guys.  There's going to be a fight in the schoolyard.  Yeah, a night fight.  A rumble.  A rumble.  Meet you right back.  We're clicky people, though.  It's not just them.  It's us, too.  We got the whole click here.  I mean, you could, like, take over the click here.  You could, like, be the tough guys. 
[01:12:00]  You could be the tough guys.  Just come in.  No, we can't.  You guys have, like, a rap channel, aren't you?  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  We're tough until they show up.  That's right.  Until they show up to work.  Yeah.  Take all our cigarettes.  Uh-oh.  Here come the Escalades.  We eat shit.  Here it is, 12.30 to 1.  After lunch, the Gary Hahn, a CES marketing strategy.  There you go.  No, here's where I start nodding off.  You can nod off on that one.  I like CES.  Hold on. 
[01:12:30]  CES.  Let me talk about marketing for a second.  We got the New York Post in front of us, right?  Friday morning, I go to the corner store to get my papers, read the papers every day.  On the cover.  On the cover.  Well, the back cover, which is the sports cover.  The bottom quarter of the page in Opie and Anthony Edd for XF Satellite Radio.  There you go.  Very happy.  What is this meeting going to entail?  Well, I see CES slash marketing strategy.  Just to make sure you understand, there's all these great things that are going to happen  at CES. 
[01:13:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Is that it?  It's great things.  All right.  I like CES.  We had a great time at CES last year.  You actually can technically sleep during that one if you want.  I might snooze.  That's fine.  Okay.  And I like the CES because there'll be some gambling involved.  There'll be a lot of gambling.  Which actually, prior to the door incident, was the last time you and I actually talked  for more than five minutes.  Yeah.  At the blackjack table.  Yes.  Yeah.  We were hanging at the blackjack table.  That's why I'm looking forward to CES.  I have a thing.  It's unlike Opie. 
[01:13:30]  Opie makes friends with management.  But you think I want to make friends.  No.  You really don't.  You obviously have to.  Someone has to.  You've gone above and beyond anything that you have to do.  I don't know about that.  Look at what I do.  Yeah.  I would love to do what you do.  I don't talk to these people.  That would be great.  I would love to.  Don't talk to me either.  I don't talk to Jimmy.  I would love to be in that role.  Opie really wants to hate me.  He would prefer to.  It would be better for him if he hated me. 
[01:14:00]  Especially with my new life.  I would love to have your role, Anthony.  I have great respect for Elo as his work.  And the thought of bothering him as he is such a busy person.  Unless, of course, I need a door.  A car door.  For a car.  Then I will call.  They were amazed, by the way, at the collision place.  When I went back in there to pick up the vehicle, which was done to a T perfectly.  Amazed that I came up with the door.  They swore my last name was Motors.  With the way this door came in, like it was for the president. 
[01:14:30]  It was a presidential door.  We went to the top.  I must thank you.  Absolutely.  Right to the top of General Motors.  Absolutely.  I like that.  See, and I don't want to distract them with things like, how were you doing?  How was your holiday?  Stupid stuff like that.  Let's get a door.  Let's get me a door.  That's it.  Jimmy, how are your doors?  All the old Saturn's running good.  That's good, though, you know.  High-profile radio show, you're in a Saturn. 
[01:15:00]  It's not even a bad car.  Saturn is a quality car.  It really is, actually.  General Motors, my friend, puts out quality vehicles that you should be in.  You should be in with the XM built right in.  Navigation system.  I could get you in an Escalade for 1 to 1.30.  We have a meeting with Brian.  POPs, direct marketing, new XM radios.  There you go.  That'll be fun. 
[01:15:30]  That'll be good.  Now, I kind of like this, too.  You should like that.  I've seen something at one of these shows.  It fits perfectly where my navigation system is in my Escalade,  and it is a brand-new XM unit that also shows the traffic jams.  Nav traffic, that's called.  Nav traffic, that's called.  And it fits perfectly, custom, right in to the Escalade slot that my nav is.  What's it going to take?  Brian Shea's your guy.  Brian's my guy?  That's why you have the meeting.  I'm enjoying this meeting.  When I get things, I like the meeting. 
[01:16:00]  There you go.  All right, 1.30 to 2.  Chance and Ann, David Butler.  That's all PR.  That's about public relations, making sure that whatever you say on this fine program,  the quality program, not that you're a quality person, the quality program.  Yes, quality program.  That when hard-hitting news happens, like when broad-minded showed up,  which I'm still floored, by the way.  They're actually coming in here, but we'll talk about that in a minute.  But when broad-minded showed up or Al Franken shows up and you break news, 
[01:16:30]  how do you get to PR and how does it get across the scroll on CNN  or how does it become headline on Fox News?  All right, this is something I need not be involved in.  No, but it's important.  It is important.  Oh, it is important.  And that's what other people do.  I have no...  You know something?  You should sleep during that.  I like the way you said that, what it entails, what it's going to do for the show.  So, as far as me being there and chiming in, no.  I don't see me saying two words on this one. 
[01:17:00]  So, let's say you take that half hour off.  Right.  That half hour.  That's your afternoon break.  How about we call it, and I'll pencil it in.  Here it is.  Nappy.  Nap.  Nap time.  Time.  Okay.  There it is.  All right.  Nappy time.  Nappy time.  I'm going to get a little mat.  We're going to sit down.  Pull a George Costanza.  You can sit under my desk if you want.  Have a mat.  2 p.m.  Here it is.  Meeting with Eric Logan dash his office. 
[01:17:30]  Uh-oh.  Which is always fun.  I like watching you write on the glass wall.  Like a beautiful...  You haven't seen my new office, though.  It's a new one?  We're on the first floor now.  We have a whole new...  Stop it.  Yeah, we have a whole new floor.  Okay.  This is exciting.  I've got new TVs.  I like his memorabilia.  Do you have stuff in there?  No, I've got new TVs.  We've got a whole new audio-visual room.  It's our new Hendrix room.  It's great.  Why are we looking at an hour here?  It's probably going to be closer to 2, actually.  All right.  There's another problem.  There's...  There's...  Now we're talking 4 p.m. before departure? 
[01:18:00]  Right.  It gives you time to shower, freshen, and then we're going to go to dinner.  And then there's dinner with Elo.  Yep.  I actually enjoy the dinner with Elo.  I'd rather cut the meeting off there and just do a early drinks  and dinner.  But then...  But see, if you do that, the dinner won't...  You know, then the dinner will be long.  We're going to be at dinner till, I don't know, probably 9, 30, 10.  9, 30, 10.  Is that what you're looking at?  Something like that, yeah. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  I've got to disagree.  As far as I'm concerned, more time with Elo is good.  The more time...  This has nothing to do with me eventually going to ask him to help me get a cheaper car.  The bottom line is, I can't...  It's not about that.  It cares about that.  Saturns are fine.  This is about more time with Elo is good time.  All right.  That's what open eyes say.  All right.  Should we play the game Ask Elo now, Ant?  Ah, people love Ask Elo.  We love Ask Elo.  Cindy in New Jersey, what's up?  Hi.  I just wanted to know if you guys saw your picture in Vanity Fair. 
[01:19:00]  No.  Vanity Fair.  What was that about?  See?  Yeah.  Public relations.  See?  That's why you need to go to the meeting, Anthony.  No, see?  Look, it happened without me even knowing about it.  But you should go.  Let's just keep it that way.  What was the picture about?  Um, it's a promotion for XM, and your picture is just as big as Tyra Banks, Ellen, Al Franken.  You're in the top news radio section of it, and it's a listing of all the channels, and  it's you, Jimmy, and...  Oh, it's the pullout, right?  It's the pullout.  It's the pullout that's been in a lot of the hot magazines. 
[01:19:30]  I'm liking it.  And little Jimmy's lips, they're so pursed.  He looks like he's just, ooh, trying to shove one out.  It's really cute.  Are they Percy My Lips?  Yeah, you are.  Are they Percy My Lipsy?  He didn't seem happy about it.  Thank you, Cindy.  Let's go to Bone in Fresno.  Bone.  Hey, this is Bone.  Hey.  Good morning.  All right.  And I feel like a total dick, because I was calling to rank on the whole advertising thing,  but I was looking at the back of my direct TV, on TV, direct guide, and you guys aren't 
[01:20:00]  prominently displayed.  But if they're doing it everywhere else, man, I just feel stupid right now.  Are we mentioned at all?  Not at all.  No, there's no, it's the trifold, right?  It's the back of the trifold?  It's the absolute back cover.  Yeah.  Yeah, it doesn't mention anybody.  It just says, it's just a generic thing that says XM's on direct TV.  No, it's got all the different channels, but it doesn't have O&A.  Uh, well, I'd have to see it.  And then Anthony's going to have to go to this two o'clock meeting to try to get an answer. 
[01:20:30]  Yes, I will get answers.  Please.  I know a girl in L.A. who listens to us on direct TV.  It's great.  Yeah.  I love direct TV, and it's cool, because, you know, I got XM right when I found out you  guys were on, but all the people that don't know you guys are on, that are getting, you  know, direct TV, it'd be great.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, buddy.  Thanks.  See ya.  Yeah, we love direct TV, getting a lot of listeners through that.  What else are you working on, Eric? 
[01:21:00]  Anything you could announce today?  Not today.  Not today.  It's never an announcement.  It's never on our show.  What about the arch enemy?  No, it's not true.  It's not true.  That's become a farce, the arch enemy thing.  No, it's going to crystallize probably in the next couple hours.  A couple hours?  Yeah.  I was out last week.  A lot of things, a lot of balls dropped.  I got to shake some cages this morning.  He was on vacation last week.  Oh, the whole week.  Yeah, and Opie didn't bother me at all.  Wow.  Didn't call me once.  Nope.  Left me alone.  That's right.  And I thanked him first thing this morning. 
[01:21:30]  That's what we should be doing.  Many of my compadres here at the Eck, as we call it, chose not to observe the same sort  of restraint.  Oh, really?  They needed to suckle, and you weren't around.  That's right.  A lot of people need to suckle.  No suckling.  That's why he's the big boss.  They wanted puggles.  They're puggles.  Can you get a puggle?  I have a line on some puggles.  What about the enemy thing?  What's that mean?  Arch enemy.  What?  There's somebody perhaps joining the XM family that can be advantageous to this program and 
[01:22:00]  other things involving XM that should be coming on board, but like he says, it must crystallize.  Crystalize.  And then we can announce it.  Do you like that word?  I like that.  Crystallize.  Crystallize.  He's waiting for the security to show up to work today.  Is that it?  Yeah.  And then we can announce who it is.  So there's been all kinds of speculation as to who people think it is.  It has to come to fruition. 
[01:22:30]  Ooh.  Very good.  Jimmy, nice job.  Very nice.  I like that.  Good one.  You know, the one thing in the meeting, I'll tell you, our 3 to 5.30 meeting that we're  going to have.  4, 5.30.  Okay.  2, and a half.  All right?  No, I mean, Jimmy and I had a brief conversation about this offline.  That's another big word.  Offline.  Offline.  Like that.  Is Canada, which you desperately want to be a part of.  I thought we are a part of it.  No, you are.  No, but we're going to have a very end-depth discussion about understanding, you know, 
[01:23:00]  what the laws and what things are in Canada.  Uh-huh.  With the head of programming for XM Satellite Radio in Canada.  We're going to get him on the phone.  Oh, really?  Oh, conference call today also in the office.  We call those telcons.  He's been a big...  Telcons.  He's been a big supporter of the show already.  Yeah, he's a huge supporter of the show.  Over the weekend, there was a bunch of articles on XM Canada, and we were mentioned prominently  in a bunch of them.  We were.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  PR.  PR. 
[01:23:30]  See?  PR.  We're making the Canadian press.  Big time.  And this guy's sticking up for us like crazy.  Because a lot of people are like, hey, Howard can't be on in Canada.  Why are these guys allowed to be on in Canada?  Because we're great.  And he said something about how we're not mean-spirited, and we're all about just having  fun.  Silly geese, I think, is the word.  We're silly geese?  We're silly geese.  Silly geese.  He's been tuned to 202?  202.  All right.  Just asking.  Just asking.  155.  We got it confused.  Are people starting to sign up for XM Canada?  How does that work?  Yeah.  I mean, they have this founders program where people were able to sign up early, and they're 
[01:24:00]  just now starting to sell radios.  So the service is up and running.  And that counts?  No, we'll be the same.  We're going to count them separately.  It's a totally different business in Canada.  XM Canada.  XM Canada, yeah.  Yeah.  That's the .ca on the website.  Is that a publicly traded company on the Canadian exchange?  I think they're going to be public.  Going to be.  Can we get in on that IPO?  Come to the PR meeting.  I'm sure we can find out. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, let's find that out.  I want another IPO that I could get in at 19 and have it go to 13.  Yeah, I was going to say, not the Fareed way.  Shit Adele.  Oh, Jesus.  Thanks, Fareed.  My God, Fareed.  Thanks for the help.  He's not listening, Alfie.  He's got a young 20-year-old girlfriend.  Yeah, he's pretty much blown off.  She's 21 now.  21 now?  He's blown off his company.  He runs the company.  He's blown it off for young snatch.  Is she dating a 20-year-old?  Yeah.  I don't know.  He's got to be at least 33, 34.  Yeah, at least.  That should be, when I go to Yahoo and check my stocks, and there's a little asterisk next 
[01:25:00]  to the company name that means that there's news for that company, every bit of news should  be, Fareed is having sex with a 21-year-old girl today.  And that's why the stock is going down or not moving up or whatever the hell it's doing.  That is what they call a cocktease stock.  All right, let's play Ask Elo before he gets out of here.  Joe in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm glad you guys are on the air, but I've got a phone to pick with Eric Logan. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, boy.  And that is, he's got 900 baseball stations going on, and he takes XM82, the system, off  of the air to put effing Christmas music on.  He sucked.  Yeah.  I love it.  Yeah.  Wait, what do you mean, sir?  The Underground, what do you say it is?  They've turned, like, three or four stations into all Christmas music.  Into all Christmas music.  How many stations are going on?  Five total.  Five.  Five.  Five Christmas channels.  XM channels are now all Christmas.  Is that going to go, like, into, like, April and May? 
[01:26:00]  No, it'll be over at Christmas.  That's kind of the point.  What's the strategy between five of them?  Well, there's so many different types of music that you can play.  There's country, there's traditional.  Is there going to be country Christmas?  Yes.  And rockin' Christmas?  Yes.  And traditional.  I gotcha.  And then we have a classical.  Then we even have the wacky Christmas.  Where can I find my favorite?  Pat Boone.  Pat Boone?  He will be on the Holly Channel.  He sings some fine Christmas songs. 
[01:26:30]  Bing Crosby.  Bing Crosby.  You'd get on that.  Standards.  Yeah.  What's wacky?  No, not Pat Boone.  Andy Williams.  Andy Williams.  That's still going to be standard.  Same place.  I like Andy Williams.  What's wacky Christmas?  Like, Grandma Got Run Over by a Rain?  Exactly.  That's a funny one.  I saw Mama Kissing Daddy Under the Mistletoe.  Ah.  Joe's mad.  Joe's going to come back in a few weeks.  Joe, listen.  You know, last year we chose some other...  What's that?  How come you couldn't just put it on one of the stations that have the baseball on it? 
[01:27:00]  Because there's nothing going on in the baseball stations now.  It was the only good club station you guys got, and now it sucks.  I'm so effing mad right now.  It's not even fun.  Those stations make you want to drive off the highway.  Don't, don't, don't, don't.  The immigrant.  We have three other dance channels.  They could have just bumped the baseball station and left their club station on.  They put that club station on at the restaurant we go to.  BPM?  From the hotel.  Yeah.  BPM?  XM is in there.  Well, see, they probably were listening to the system. 
[01:27:30]  Then they realized, oh, Christmas, I'll go to another dance channel.  Right.  Which is why we have more than one.  That guy didn't realize that.  That's right.  He's stuck there listening to Christmas music.  I had people who were very angry that we took off in Goma.  And, you know, in Goma it was a tough decision.  It was a very...  Goma?  Yeah, it was the African music channel.  It was tribal African music.  And that was taken off?  Yeah.  We replaced that, and now we have Sur La Root, which is one of our fine French music  channels we have.  Ugh.  We're African.  The thing is that your demo is not people who listen to African music. 
[01:28:00]  Where are they going to carry the XM?  They don't drive.  Most of them are just running.  I didn't even realize there was an African...  One of the reasons, Anthony, why we chose to replace that channel.  Wow.  Let's go to Dirk in New Jersey.  Dirk.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, mister.  First of all, fine, fine job.  Secondly, Elo, this...  Why, when I'm watching DirecTV and I skip onto the Soul channel, the name of the song is  properly named.  And let's say I go to the Squiz or Ethel, the songs are two songs delayed. 
[01:28:30]  Why is that, the name of the song?  Why, why, why?  Those are, well, I mean, that is, when we put this thing together as fast as we did, we  listen, we know there's some problems.  We're working on it.  And we were working over, one of the many calls I had last week on my vacation was, was  as referred to the display data, or as we call that, pad data.  Pad data.  Pad data.  And my friend, I believe top priority with this was getting the music up and running. 
[01:29:00]  Which we did.  Before some of the other technical things can be taken care of.  Just be happy the music's there, my friend.  But it's going to get fixed, don't worry.  If I'm not stepping on your toes by jumping in.  No, no, no.  No, please.  Ask Elo.  Let's say hi to Ted in New Jersey.  Ted.  Hey, guys.  I had a question for Elo.  All right.  I'm trying to get my wife to enter into a threesome with me.  How can I really convince her of that?  Well, if you go to, if you go to xmradio.com, there's a great assortment of new radios. 
[01:29:30]  It makes a great holiday gift.  Here's what you do.  You tell her there's two buckets.  One where she's smiling and happy, and one she has a black eye in.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  And thank you, Eric.  We'll draw that up in the glass when we get up my office.  Yeah.  Figure it out.  There's got to be a four buckets.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob?  How you doing, guys?  Jimmy, great show Saturday night.  Thanks, buddy.  It's awesome.  Elo.  Thank you.  Yeah, I have a big pothole in front of my driveway. 
[01:30:00]  Do you know any way I can get that fixed?  Yeah.  There's a...  Yeah.  Wasn't the thing you could just call the mayor?  Are you in Manhattan?  Just call Giuliani.  Call the mayor.  Call the mayor.  First of all, Giuliani's not the mayor anymore.  Well, that's what I'm saying, but he has nothing to do.  That's my point.  I would also say if you want to fill a gigantic pothole, just drop your serious unit in it.  That should be probably a sensible.  Oh, their new units are just terrible.  I can't say that.  Yes, you can.  No, I can't.  I can't say that.  And they're getting their ass kicked in the flyers, by the way.  Oh.  We're selling radios for, what, $29? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, we've got like $29 radios.  I think I saw it in a Best Buy ad, like the radio, the roadie, I think it was, for $29.  $29.  And right next to them was the serious crap, and it was like twice the price.  Yeah, and twice the size.  You dummies.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the good thing about their portable unit, though, is if you want to just record  something and listen to it, you can kind of do that, which is kind of nice, as  opposed to listening to it live.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, it's 5 o'clock.  No, it's not.  Yeah, that's great when it comes to sporting events. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, shit.  Just pray no one tells you the score of the ball game.  That's good when you've got football all year.  You've got to just download the game and don't watch it on TV.  Just walk around the kitchen alone and listen to it later.  Woo-hoo!  Fucking assholes.  All right.  4 o'clock on a Tuesday, it's like, you know, will he make it?  Does the field goal go through?  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  What about the Giants?  That was just beautiful.  Oh, my God.  They should lose.  I actually stayed up all night.  I stayed up all night.  I stayed up all night to watch the Jets game, too.  Why would you watch the Jets? 
[01:31:30]  Because I was pulling for you.  I was just...  I gave up on the Jets.  It's over, Johnny.  It's all about hockey.  The Islanders beat the Flyers.  That's all I care about.  No, as soon as Chad went down, season over.  Yeah, but Bollinger's got some hope, I've got to tell you.  He's not that bad, actually, now that they're giving him some playing time.  When did he get hurt, Chad?  Did he hurt again?  Holy shit.  First game of the year.  I haven't been watching football this year.  He went down, and they get Vinny, and Fielder went down.  We've lost three quarterbacks, basically.  Fielder went down in the same game.  Yeah.  So we lost two of our quarterbacks the first game.  That's when I said season over. 
[01:32:00]  Is Chad out for the year?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What happened to him?  He might be...  Collarbone.  He might be done, done.  He may be done, done.  Collarbone?  Yeah.  He might be done, done.  I think it's the second one.  Yeah.  And then they went and got Vinny.  I'm like, game over.  Yeah.  Time to watch hockey.  And then root for that draft pick.  That's right.  Hold out for the Reggie Bush.  We lost to the Saints.  Ugh.  Oops.  And the Giants, yeah, they lost to the Seahawks 24-21.  You know, I went to that Museum of American History yesterday, and it was a lot of fun.  Somebody actually had a serious unit and put it down, and people started 
[01:32:30]  taking pictures of it.  They thought it was Eli Whitney's cotton jam.  Seacus, it's big.  It's a big spinning wheel.  Ancient technology.  Anything else, Eli?  No, the only thing to add to the meetings for tomorrow is we do have some HR meetings,  so that's it for tomorrow.  Give us a big announcement on our show.  There's meetings tomorrow?  I promise you.  But none for us, right?  What's that?  No meetings for us tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  No, there's meetings.  They're campy. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, it does.  They're canopy.  I have a 12 o'clock train back to the Big Apples, I like to call it.  They're canopy.  Yeah.  He's got to be lying.  Yeah, there is.  He's lying.  You fiver.  Wait a minute.  That's too smart for you.  I'd meet with human resources, but it's not going on.  So you meet with them today?  Oh, it's Wednesday.  Give us a big announcement today.  I'll give you...  I will get you a big announcement this week, I promise.  Real big?  Real big.  Possibly two.  I have one.  What?  I can't say it.  What is it?  Sirius has AIDS. 
[01:33:30]  Pretty much they do.  It's not working out for them like they thought.  I will be leaving that front gate tomorrow, 11.01.  That is when I will be pulling out and driving home, hopefully...  Pointing north?  Yes.  That's it.  All right.  Northbound.  All right.  We're going to take a break and continue with the Opie and Anthony program live from Washington, D.C.  Elo, thank you.  Anytime, boys.  Anytime, boys.  He's off to his meetings.  We'll see you later, okay?  You got it.  Make no mistake about it. 
[01:34:00]  These are evildoers.  Yes.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show live from Washington, D.C.  They have no justification.  That's how they're actions.  This is Eve.  This is Eve.  That's the real deal.  Yes, that's what we do. 
[01:34:30]  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  That's the real deal.  Yes, that's what we do.  That's the real deal.  That's the shit.  Yeah.  Dance, motherfuckers.  Dance, motherfuckers.  Dance.  Dance, motherfuckers. 
[01:35:00]  Dance, motherfuckers.  Dance, motherfuckers.  Dance, motherfuckers.  I want to hear some music, man.  Shut your face  I want into music, man 
[01:35:30]  I want into music, man  Shut your face  I want into music, man  I know  Who gives the parts to me  Who gives the parts to me  Oh, okay, terrific 
[01:36:00]  Oh, okay, okay  I like it  I like it 
[01:36:30]  Won't the engine call me  I like it  Give the parts to me  I like it  Won't the engine call me  I like it  Give the parts to me  That's the real deal 
[01:37:00]  That's what we do  That's the real deal  That's the shit  That's the real deal  Yeah, that's what we do  That's the real deal  That's the shit  That's the real deal  Give the parts to me  Yeah, that's what we do  That's the shit  Give the parts to me 
[01:37:30]  I like it  I like it  I like it  Yeah, we'll talk about that 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, it's crazy and addicting  I want more friends  Hey, man  I don't have enough friends  I don't  You got plenty of friends, Jimmy  This is the Opie and Anthony program  Spreading the virus across America  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio  Tell your friends about us  Especially when we're kicking ass  You hear something really good on the show  Yeah  You share it with somebody else 
[01:38:30]  And then the virus slowly but surely spreads  Right  And then we get to do bigger and bigger gigs for everybody  Yes  And we'll get bigger guests and all that  That's how all that crap works  Okay  That's how that works  That's right  We should get into this anti-gay short film  Targeted at teenage boys  That Steve found  I guess it goes back to 1961  And it's titled  Boys Beware  Boys Beware 
[01:39:00]  Boys Beware  What seems to be the problem?  Well, there's a  A  A  Gee out there  Homosexuals  There's some of that  Gee out there  And they're targeting your teenage boys  Of course they are  What are you going to do?  Go for the old wrinkled ones?  You want a buttocks that are tight as a drum  God didn't want you to touch him  He wouldn't have made  Loatian boys looking like that  Sorry  I didn't mean to interrupt your drum sound  I didn't know you were going to do it  I'm just jumping out with my hotness 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, of course they would go after the teenage boys  Yes, oh dear  They're not going to roam the hallways of the VA hospital  No  Yeah, that guy's hot  What?  The Gee's like  You know  They've got to be all tender  They like him young and fresh  Alright  Do we have that clip there, Derek?  By the way  We brought the whole crew down here  The whole gang  E-Rock is here 
[01:40:00]  Who I was up much too late with  Drinking with last night  Except for Travis  He stayed home  I think he felt that there might be  Some kind of a problem on the train ride  And he decided to play it safe  Yeah, playing it safe  That's right  That's what Travis is all about  Like I said  We've got the whole gang here  We've got E-Rock  Even E-Rock  Nathaniel, who did a great job at Caroline's  Opening up for Jim Norton  He did do a very fine job  He's down here  Steve, of course  Ben, with a new haircut  That makes it look like he's wearing a wig or something  We haven't even got into that yet 
[01:40:30]  Really?  I didn't even notice  I just saw his sweater like that  He's like a tall six-year-old  That's what Ben is dressing  He has a little red stripe on it  Nice sweater, faggot  And of course  Derek is here as well  So we've got the whole gang  Keeping my  My instant replay off  That's right  Like a good boy  Why don't we play this clip  And see where it goes  Okay  That looks innocent enough, doesn't it? 
[01:41:00]  Lots of young people hitchhike  Seems like a good way to get from one place to another  But sometimes there are dangers involved that never meet the eye  So no matter where you meet a stranger  Be careful if they are too friendly  One never knows when the homosexual is about  Let's take the case of Jimmy Barnes  Uh-oh  Jimmy played baseball all afternoon  And he didn't feel like walking home  So he decided that some arrived  Oh boy  He'd done it a hundred times before 
[01:41:30]  That sounds good to be somewhere else  He didn't think anything was unusual  When the driver struck up a friendly conversation  Suck my cock  He seemed like a real nice guy  Of course  What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick  A sickness that was not visible like smallpox  But no less dangerous and contagious  A sickness of the mind  You see, Ralph was a homosexual  A person who demands an intimate relationship  With members of their own sex  So no matter where you meet a stranger 
[01:42:00]  Be careful if they are too friendly  If they try to win your confidence too quickly  And if they become overly personal  One never knows when the homosexual is about  He may appear normal  And chances are he did the music  That you're hearing right now  That's great  It's contagious  Once they get that dick in you  You just gotta have more  It's a disease 
[01:42:30]  We've come a long way, huh?  Holy crap  Achoo!  Oh great  You've got a faggot all over me  I'm like, you're the faggot in me  It's contagious  Wow, 1961  Trolling around  Yeah, you know  Whenever gays or blacks or Asians or anybody  Says that things are really bad 
[01:43:00]  Just take a little trip down memory lane  You know, drag up some old audio  Like that  Boy, the gays have come a long, long way  Parading down the streets now  Got their own gay day parades  They don't have to hide anymore  No hiding  Lucky us  In the restaurants  Just talking about gay issues  You can always tell when the homosexual is about 
[01:43:30]  On Halloween  Because half of the fucking city is closed down  While they parade around in tight pants  Which tempt everyone  How to spot the homosexual?  Chaps with no ass  The costume of the queer  Man  Good luck to you  Is there more to that? 
[01:44:00]  That's fantastic  That's about it  That's all we have right now  The homosexual is about  Need more  He's about  Out and about  Kid plays baseball  Troll ride  A ride from a stranger  I'd like to see what that film looks like  Like what does the gay guy look like?  Just a normal dude?  He's wearing a hat  He probably smiles a lot  He's dressed like Clark Kent  In the old Superman TV show  Did Steve see the video?  Fedora  Many times  Have you seen the video?  Oh yes he has  Alright here we go  Here comes Steve 
[01:44:30]  The homosexual will touch your smooth Lebanese arms  Steve?  What's the video all about?  The video is a short  It's a short film  And the homosexual guy looks like  What's Ron Howard's brother's name?  Clint Howard I think  Clint Howard  Yeah he kind of looks like that  With that big awful bald spot  Jesus  Yeah  And he's picking him up in a Prius  Yes exactly  A little hybrid car  Could you step in after your baseball game? 
[01:45:00]  Does he have crazy eyes or anything?  No  No it's not  It's just he's tooling around  In his old Studebaker  Studebaker  It might be  I don't know  Driving with his dick  Hello young man  And he's tooling around  Picking up boys  And the lad gets in the car  And how is the too friendly?  How is he too friendly?  He's too friendly  He's like you know  Patting him on the back  Kind of thing  Ah  A little touching going on  Yeah exactly  Trying to bond with him laughing  Yeah it's nothing too overt  Remember this is 1961  Yes but now it just goes from  Instructional to hot  Yeah  The way he plays ball all day 
[01:45:30]  He needs his back rubbed  Yeah  Everyone knows that  A little sweat on the bag  He's going to dab it dry  With his handkerchief  The kid has a huge cock  It's just his cup  You're all disappointed  Jesus  I'm just saying  That's part of what happens  In those defraved minds  That's a great line  A valid point  What can I tell ya  That's a great line  Love those old movies  All right Steve  Thank you  Also we got some  Dickie Goodman remixes in  Yeah 
[01:46:00]  This thing  It might take off  We're not really sure  Just before Thanksgiving  Do you even remember  Doing a show before Thanksgiving  That Wednesday show  Was so fucking out there  I heard the replay  Yeah  We were just goofing off  More than usual  Why not  It was fun  And we were talking about  All the bad songs  That came out in the 70's  One of them was  The Dickie Goodman  Mr. Jaws  Mr. Jaws  The Jaws song  Yeah  Do we have that  We should play that again  For everybody  Or at least a piece of it  We'll play the whole damn thing 
[01:46:30]  I think it's only what  A minute and a half  Or something like that  Two minutes long  It's so bad  Well I want to play this  As an example  Because now what's happening  The listeners are now  Trying to make their own  Dickie Goodman type songs  For the radio show  They're Dickie Goodman songs  Dickie Goodman used to  Do these little narratives  And he'd be like  A reporter on the street  And he'd ask questions  And the questions were answered  By popular music of the day  Yes  Like he'd take a line  From a song  That was very very popular  When he wrote this 
[01:47:00]  So now not only  Are the songs all dated  But the whole gimmick itself  Is hacky  And the questions  And then the answers  With the music  Are just deuce chilling  Horrible  But these were hugely popular  Back when he did them  And well the listeners  Are sitting in their own  And they're just as bad  They're bad  So far  They're not doing good  Dickie Goodman impressions  That's why  That's why I want to 
[01:47:30]  Replay the original  Here on the street  Like stupid Dickie does  Yeah that's why  We want to replay the original  So they get a better idea  And then we're listening  To the ones that  The listeners submitted  Yeah  And these fucking guys  Holy crap  They put us in a really  Uncomfortable situation  There's one that  We will play for everybody  That's extremely racist  Extremely  Yeah the guy just put together  A bunch of like  He just went the complete  Racist route  It's not even funny  What do you do  Take a bunch of things  That we've said  Yeah 
[01:48:00]  And there's a  There's a fine  Black gentleman  That was helping out  Jaime  Yeah  In studio  Getting ready for the broadcast  And over the monitors  As we're sitting here  Reading the papers  Getting ready for the show  It's blaring  It's blaring the n-word  Over and over again  And I'm  I'm getting like  Flop sweat  Like holy shit  Will you guys turn this down  Do you see what's going on here  You have a moment  Where you think  Your internal thoughts  Are being played  Right  Turn it off  And they thought  They were just laughing 
[01:48:30]  And laughing  In that room  They thought it was just  Hilarious that we were  In that uncomfortable situation  Payback is a bitch boys  Alright here's  The Dickie Goodman  The original  Song  Let's play this  So people get an idea  Again  Okay  Hit it  We are here on the beach  Where a giant shark  Has just eaten  A girl swimmer  Well Mr. Jaws  How was it  And what did she say  When you grabbed her  I know sharks are stupid 
[01:49:00]  But what did you think  When you took that first bite  How sweet it is  Mr. Jaws  Before you swim out to sea  Have you anything else to say  I can't breathe  With me now  Is the local sheriff  Sheriff Brody  The shark will be back  For lunch  What do you intend to do  Do a little dance  Make a little love  Just arriving is  Oceanographer Matt Hooper 
[01:49:30]  Sir  If someone is attacked  By a shark  What should they do  Do the hunt  We are going aboard  The fishing boat  Of Captain Quint  Captain  Will you be able  To catch this giant shark  Thank you Captain  Captain  Captain  Captain  When you catch  One of these sharks  What do you feel like  Like a rhinestone cowboy  We've just sighted  The shark again  He's coming straight for us  Captain Quint  Is shouting something at him  Hey Jaws 
[01:50:00]  The captain says  He's going to catch you  What do you think of that  Uh oh  Here he comes again  They've hit him  Mr. Jaws  Why doesn't anything  Seem to hurt you  He's coming right  Onto the boat  Mr. Jaws  Why are you grabbing my hand  No wait  Mr. Jaws  That's not the way 
[01:50:30]  This record is supposed to end  Help  Help  But he's obviously  Not a friend  Because he's trying  Yeah  Eat him  So  And why  He should have done the hustle  And he should have grabbed  His writing hand  And the bottom line is  This is what a great  Comic sense he has  You don't say hand twice  Shit face  It should have been  Why are you ripping at my wrist  Wouldn't you give your hand  To a friend  You hide the joke a little  Right  Hide it a little  The sad part  He did hide the joke  Yeah  Completely  He buried it under dreck  It's been 30 years 
[01:51:00]  And no one's found it either  The sad part  Yeah  That song was huge  When it came out  Huge  When did it come out  Like 1976  Right around the time  The movie came out  77 or whatever  Right after the movie  And it was massive  And he had a few of these  Back in the day  Who was laughing at that though  Like who would hear that guy  Do the hustle  Did you hear the Jaws song  On the radio  Dickie Goodman  God is that funny  What stations played it  You think any W played it  Everybody did  Every  Every pop station  Pop station was played 
[01:51:30]  Every pop station  That was heard on AM radio  Alright so the listeners  Have sent in their own  And we gotta start somewhere  You guys gotta understand that  And someone made one  For Space Hitler  Space Hitler  This bizarre concept  That Anthony came up with  Out of nowhere  One of my favorite new characters  It's like a comic book character  It's slowly but surely developing  Yeah people have photoshopped it  On the message boards  They've taken it upon themselves  To take Hitler  And put him in space like situations 
[01:52:00]  I even did one  I put him in a  Flash Gordon movie poster  Space Hitler  It's wonderful  It's a great concept  That should  Someone should run with it  Someone with talent  You don't understand  Space Hitler  Not yet  I never heard of it  No  Because there's no such thing  I made it up  No no no  But I mean  I didn't even hear  Your character  It's not really a character  It's just  Take Hitler  And put him in space  He obviously didn't work  Too well here on earth  No  But in space 
[01:52:30]  Where he's battling evil  He's so evil  That he'd probably do well  No good  There's no good people  Because they would be  Trying to fight Hitler  Space Hitler  Just fucks with evil  People in space  Yeah like the aliens  That are kind of  Taking a look at it  And he takes like Nazi stuff  But it's space age  Nazi stuff  So you said  So the panzer tank  Is now like a panzer ship  Oh  And space Hitler  Is dressed like Hitler  But only it's very  Futuristic garb 
[01:53:00]  It's a tighter uniform  Yeah like mylar  Yeah  So he'd probably like  Darth Vader  Yet try to kill  Darth Vader's voice  Right  And try to kill  The guy that actually  Made the movie  Right  And produced it  And all the producers  In Hollywood  But Peter Cushing  He'd be very fond of  Of course he would  Alright well  I just like  Same little mustache  Which is kind of  Ridiculous in space  But that's part of 
[01:53:30]  His look  So you  Space Hitler  Well P-Niggity  Came up with a  Space Hitler thing  Done  The Dickie  Goodman way  Of course it is  Let's take a listen  See if we can  Get through the  The whole thing  That's the goal  When you send this  Stuff in to us  To get us to  Get to the end  Hit it  This is London  Calling  Here is a news flash  The German radio  Has just announced  That Hitler  Is dead  Repeat that

[01:55:30]  Or should I call him  Space Duce  Benito  Anything that you'd like  To say about  Space Hitler  He's my favorite  Honking  Space Hitler  How did Ava Braun  Take the cyanide  On that final day  In a bunker  Any thoughts  On racial integration  That's all the time  We have for today  Farewell  Space Hitler  He got some really 
[01:56:00]  Bad songs in there  Which is part  Of the bit  You can't try  To do it well  You gotta put  Some real bad  Things in there  He gets a passing grade  Passing grade  Better than Dickie Goodman  Yeah  Give him a C plus  C plus  I don't like his  Dickie Goodman impression  Or lack thereof  Yeah you need to do  The Dickie Goodman impression  If you're gonna do these  Yeah it's gotta be  Very exciting  Yes  And uh  Yeah he had a couple  Of bad ones  That was good though  He's my favorite  Honking  Alright  There were a couple  Laughs in there

[01:58:00]  We need audio of this  Yeah can we  I wanna hear the happy  Peppy  Can we get audio today  Talking about  The pan dog  Look at the smiles  They're so happy  And laughing  About the pan dog  Now go into  A bus fire  Yeah they're a bunch  Of phonies though  They didn't even  Acknowledge that  Someone got hit  At the Thanksgiving  Day parade  No  By the light fixture  Or whatever  Thank you sir  What's this  That was a good  Counterpoint  A counterpoint  Oh the pan dog  Cute  Another dog story  Woman mauled to death 
[01:58:30]  By dogs  A pack of six dogs  Mauled a 76 year old woman  To death  As she worked in her yard  Lillian Lorraine Stiles  Was riding on a lawnmower  That must have just been  Some scene  In her front yard  She was confronted  By the dogs  Described as  What kind of dogs  German Shepherds  Anyone  I have an idea  German Shepherds  When was the last time  A German Shepherd  Attacked someone  1964  What  I believe  What they're finally cured  They still have it in them 
[01:59:00]  German Shepherds  Never attack people anymore  I got bit on the side  Of the knee  By a damn German Shepherd  What year  19  I was probably listening  To Dickie Goodman  Dickie Goodman  Mr. Dog  These are  Pitbull  Rottweiler  Mixed breeds  Oh okay  There you go  But who would see that  Be in a pitbull  Of course  That's like an anomaly  Attacked  When she got off the mower  And headed to her house  An old 76 year old woman  Running as fast as she can 
[01:59:30]  Thinking she was going  To outrun some dogs  Severe bites  Over her entire body  Man tried to help  And he was bitten  On the leg  Why wouldn't you just  Run them over  With the mower  Stupid  Stay on your mower  And just try to run them over  They confronted her  Hey bitch  Turn that mower off  And she just refused  Run them over  I predict  You will never see  Woman mauled to death  By puggles  No  Woman mauled to death  By pan dog 
[02:00:00]  You will not see that  You might read  A 76 year old woman  Died  From cuteness overdose  Her heart burst  As a pack of puggles  Came and licked her face  With love  And like dolphins  They try to  Nudge her into the house  To get her to the phone  Right  Try to help her  Help her  Alright well that's a sad story  I can't wait  Until the first pit bull  Attacks the first pan dog  And just tears  His fat little stomach out  Fucking pan dog guts

[02:05:30]  Help  Oh god  Oh  You've got the age  Excellent  Excellent  Now that's the way  It's done  Not bad  He could have had  More of a  Dickie Goodman delivery  But I won't hold that  Against him  Because his material  Was very strong  Yes  Definitely  That uh  Who was that?  That also gets a passing grade  Rob C  Came up with that  Rob C  Bravo  Yes  A little more 
[02:06:00]  Dickie Goodman  Yeah  But uh  Very good Rob  Very good  The next one  Was the very racist one  That we were listening to  Before the show  As uh  As uh  One of the XM employees  Was trying to help  Jaime out in the background  This is uh  Horrible  But every  You know  It's our open forum  This program  And this guy  Decided to go  Just  I can understand  Maybe putting one in  But the guy  Just goes  The complete direction  Of every joke here  Has to be  Horribly racist  And with those 
[02:06:30]  Horrible racist songs  I don't know  Where he even got them  Couldn't have been  This program  Alright well  It's uh  Johnny Griswold  He does a lot  For the radio program  How long is it?  Four minutes?  Oh my god  No way  We're making it four minutes  Well I don't know guys  I think that  As they say  I may not agree  With what you say  But I'll die  For your right to say it  Yeah we just might  Why don't we uh  We'll uh  We'll hit play  And we'll uh  We'll see how far  We get with this one  Johnny Griswold  Good morning everybody 
[02:07:00]  This is Johnny Griswold  And this is  Whackbag Radio  Today we have  Opie  Anthony  And Jim Norton  In studio  Hey guys  First off  How many hours a day  Are you guys on the air?  Wait now  One two three four  Okay  Four hours  And in four hours  You guys spend a little time  Talking about Howard Stern  The man who says  He is the pioneer  Of satellite radio  What do you think  Of Howard Stern?  We  Hate  Our  Shooters  Well  I imagine that would be  Your response  Anthony 
[02:07:30]  It seems like you guys  Have a little war going  With Stern  What's his response been  Thus far?  And you always refer  To Robin as the hole  Why is that?  I like  Sugar and die  I like tea  But I don't like  Niggers  Nose to read  There's two known things  That'll make me  Cute  That's a hog  Eating sloth  And a big black spook  Enough about the Stern show  Opie  You're known as the mean one  Where does that anger  Come from?  I don't think  They show me the way  And Anthony  A lot of people have said 
[02:08:00]  Your anger comes from  Your divorce  What did your ex-wife do  That has you so angry?  Let's come back  Motherfucker  Ran off  With the niggers  And a lot of fans  Want to know  Why you have so many guns  Anthony  The house next door  To me  Has been sold  To niggers  Oh my god  Yep  That would do it  Opie  You recently had  Some homeless people  In the studio  What's the smell like  In there  Some niggers  Never die  All right 
[02:08:30]  Listen  All right  Look  Four in a row  I can understand why  The guy just went a little overboard  There's two minutes to go  There's two minutes to go  Yes  And I think we should  Again it's an open forum  Just because I don't have to  Actually face the glass  And see who might be out there  No that's pretty white in there  This is just ridiculous  Every four in a row  Mix it up a little  Exactly  Let's see  Maybe the next one isn't  I give this guy credit 
[02:09:00]  Goodman mixed it up a little  All right  Get ready to push pause though  Because we might try to guess  The song he uses  Go ahead  You guys take a lot of calls  Any state you hate  Taking calls from  And why  I'm an Alabama nigger  And I want to be free  Hell for the N-A-A-C-P  Opie  You say that O-N-A  Always win in the end  Why is that  Finally Jimmy 
[02:09:30]  You don't really like trannies  Do you  Thanks guys  Any final thoughts  Is that it  I think that's it  I gotta tell you too  The important thing I learned  Is a couple of those songs  Were actually not that bad 
[02:10:00]  Oh really  Meaning not with the saying  But the actual songs themselves  They have a nice little beat to them  Earl in Chicago  Earl  God damn this is bad  Hey Earl  Go ahead  We just got you on the air  What's up  This is bad  This is horrific  What the hell is wrong with you guys  We didn't put that stuff together  I'm not  Not y'all  Why are individuals making bad songs like this  Oh 
[02:10:30]  I don't know  I'm gonna be honest with you  I'm not really offended  This is funny as hell to me  I guess they're the market for those songs  I've never heard most of them  Except when played in parodies  Like you hear them as a goof  But I never heard them really sung on a station  Oh yeah  I've never heard anything that racist before in my life  But it's funny as hell to me  Alright Earl  My god  It's just  One after another  Alright  Well that was Johnny Griswold  We have one more to play today  We're hoping to get more in 
[02:11:00]  And better ones in  Make sure you  You really do the Dickie Goodman impression  Okay  A little Dickie Goodman trivia by the way  Oh what ant  You know Dickie died  In 1989  At the age of 55  Good  Self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head  No kidding  Somebody finally play his song for him  He took a second  Had a moment of clarity  And looked back on his career  I thought that was funny  Blam  There's a  A blam 
[02:11:30]  Go ahead  No I was just gonna say Dickie Dwyer  Dickie please  You don't have to make any more of those songs  He's pulling it out of a bag  Could be an idea for a listener  Interview Dickie Goodman about his career  Yeah of course  And where it went wrong  Did he really kill himself in 89?  Yeah  Wow  Yeah  I guess the Dickie Goodman song about the Berlin Wall coming down  Shut himself  Wasn't working out too well for him  No  Couldn't find enough songs to make it work  No about that  To make that work  Right 
[02:12:00]  Yeah after the one Pink Floyd reference he probably put in there  He was like alright nothing else  I got nothing  Bam  Well uh  Who are we to say  Johnny Griswold's getting rave reviews on the phone lines  Proven that we're broadcasting all over America  Let's go to Dave in Georgia  Dave  That's the funniest fucking song  And one of those songs  I used to live in Texas  And they used to play it at a nightclub  And there were a few darker people in it  But they even liked it  It was kind of funny  But that's the funniest fucking bit you guys have done in two weeks man 
[02:12:30]  Let's clear this up  I doubt they liked it  But they just kind of felt like  Well we'll just kind of tap along so we don't get the shit beat out of it  I thought they liked it sir  Good point Jimmy  Yeah  Yeah they laughed along  Well there was two of them  There was two and there was 500 white guys in the bar  With their fucking names on their own belt buckles  Right  I was fucking ready guys  Fuck it up  Yeah they were enjoying it  Sure they were  Alright finally we got Carmine from the Bronx  To wrap up this Dickie Goodman thing

[02:14:00]  Their junk  Is around averaging 12  They're packing 12  And the thrusting  And the force  Of when they finish  Can cause serious internal injuries  Resulting in possible death  You never want to get F to death  That's where it ends  Alright  You know what this dubby did 
[02:14:30]  It's like  Holy crap  He doesn't ask questions  He could have wrecked a bit for everybody  He says something  And then just plays a song  That kind of touches that  Like he'll say  So I went out yesterday  And I didn't know  I don't know  Yeah  Asshole  You can't find songs  And then work a story around it  The cheater  Cheater  The guy almost killed the bit  Almost  We stopped it just in time  I think  So Anthony  Do you need your education?

[02:16:00]  He's going to talk about his dog?  We're going to say  Wow you're wearing something that says Chicago on it  And it's not because you like the band  It's because your dog's name is Chicago  What new can we get out of the Mad Mexican?  And then we're going to go  Hey are you going to say hi to us  When you start your show?  And then he's going to go  Yeah  At 10 o'clock tune in  And then we tune in at 10  And we hear a lot of Spanish words  And we hear Jim Norton 
[02:16:30]  Opie and Anthony in English  You hear Opie and Anthony  Then you'll hear more just incoherent nonsense  And then Jim Norton  Something something extraordinaire  Yeah exactly  Right right  Here's what we do to the Mad Mexican  This is how we get some good radio  Yes  We take his clothes off  Stay with me  This is good  I'll try  We hook little sensors up to his penis  And we show him episodes of Zoom  And we see how long it takes  And we get a hard on  I say 8 seconds  Zoom  Fucking jelly bean creep

We're trying  But just like you said  What could we  Yeah but you do Thanksgiving every year with your family  And you mentioned it at the top of the show today

On this day  Prescribed by law  And marked by ceremony  We are led  To one conclusion  This place  Just blows  You're being harsh  The Bluebeard Anthony Show  Like sand through the hourglass 
[02:26:30]  So is the ONA virus  This reminded me of something  We didn't play the audio  Of Celine Dion  On Larry King  No we didn't  This was priceless  She was very upset  But we all understand  That it was a disaster  Down there  But how can you not laugh  When Celine Dion  Just breaks into the song  On Larry King  Because that's gonna help  The victim  That's what they need  A song helps Celine  Do she sang  They should fly her over  Fly her over 
[02:27:00]  Like the flooded areas  Yeah  In a helicopter  And lower her down  And then she could sing  The Titanic song  Wouldn't that be great  As they're hanging  On to their roof  Hold on Tyrone  Tyrone don't let go  Don't ever let go  Tyrone  If only there was room  Enough for you  On that door  That your girlfriend  Is on right now  It could be a huge  Cavernous door  And there still  Wouldn't be room  Have you seen  The women down there 
[02:27:30]  Big fat asses  You are a survivor  Many people perished  Under the brown sewage  Of New Orleans  Much like they did  That fateful night  On in April  Of 19  Hmm  18?  12?  12?  14?  19  12  It was 12  Shut up  Alright sorry  Much like they perished  In the icy waters  Of the North Atlantic  On that fateful 
[02:28:00]  Maiden voyage  Of the Titanic  But some of them  Were  Survivors  And Larry I watch  I watch and personally  I don't care  But I cry  I cry because my husband  Is 90 fucking years old  I cry when I think 
[02:28:30]  He touched me  When I was 14  He forced me  To marry him  That is why  I weep today  You think  I really care  About the  Shwoogies  Larry?  How many  Bodies  Lie there  Beneath  That 
[02:29:00]  Mucky  Brown  Stinky  Mess  I say  P-U  Larry  And some of them  Cling to their rooftops  Like  Many  Clung  To life jackets  And pieces of wood  On that fateful night  On the  Eek  They are truly  Truly  Negros  They are so poor  And so black  All right 
[02:29:30]  Back to the audio  Jesus  That was fantastic  Obi and Anthony  The virus  Is spreading  Wake up  Wake up  Wake up  Yeah I'm so tired  I'm waiting  Waiting for us  Wake up  Wake up  Wake up  Yeah I'm so sick  And we're back 
[02:30:00]  With the Obi and Anthony  Program  Spreading the virus  Across America  The ONA virus  We like that right  Yeah  We're down in  Washington D.C.  We have about an hour  Left in the show  A little more  And then we go into 
[02:30:30]  Like four hours  Of meetings  Nap time  I call that  Nap time  Absolutely  Al Franken's  Going to stop by  And say hi  I guess he's doing  His show live  From here  Today  Oh yeah  And right now  We got the girls  From a show  Called Broad Minded  They  They're on  Channel 155  Which is  What  Take 5  Yeah  It's a channel  For chicks  Basically  It's like  A lifetime  And the show's  Called Broad Minded  Misogyn  Things like that  I don't know 
[02:31:00]  That's why  They were brave enough  To come on our show  All those channels  That have the movies  About the guy  Who seems like  He's a cool guy  And he's going to  Make a great boyfriend  Or husband  And then he  Starts like  Beating the woman  Or treating her badly  But it starts subtly  Very subtle  Yeah  Yeah  He seems like  The perfect guy  And she goes around  To all her girlfriends  And he goes  I found the perfect guy  Right  This guy's so wonderful  He treats me great  And then he's got  Some deep dark secret  And he just starts  Pounding on her  And she's got to like  Pour gasoline on him 
[02:31:30]  And burn him  There's a section  In the movie  Where there's something  Wrong but no one  Knows yet  Yeah  What's going on  Because she's trying to  Cover it up  Maybe her cat's found  Dead on the porch  Hanging  And then it's like  Oh I'm sorry sweetie  And he puts that face  Dun dun dun  Dun dun dun  And then she overcomes  In the end  Of course  All chicks  They overcome in the end  So the show's called  Broad-Minded  And here's the  Description  Okay  It's Broad-Minded  Real-life friends  Shari, Molly, and Christine  As they let loose 
[02:32:00]  On sex and shopping  Bad bosses  And big butts  And movies and men  Now Opie  I didn't do anything  This is not a show  That is for our demo  Exactly  I disagree  You'd be surprised  With people  I'll listen to something  Sometimes that I don't  Think I'm going to like  And I like it  And vice versa  Sometimes I think  A guy's thing  I'm going to enjoy  And it's just  You know what I mean  Maybe our listeners  Would enjoy it  You don't know 
[02:32:30]  Uh huh  Uh huh  Well two worlds  Two worlds are colliding  At the moment  Here we go  It's Shari  And Christine  Hi ladies  Good morning  Is it early for you  A little bit  I completely disagree  This is a show for you guys  No it's not  First of all  I got to apologize  For the one microphone  Oh that's okay  We share a lot of things  Yeah that one's like  That one's no good  That one's busted  Yeah look at this one  This thing has  It's busted  This thing has AIDS or something  This one  It wouldn't stay up  They smell good  It was  Nothing to do with that

[02:33:30]  Yes I could  Shut up Jimmy  I've come to a conclusion  Girls are so much  Different than guys  Yeah just a little bit  I'm going out on a limb  Here with that one  But yeah  Now if Molly was here  Sherry would have  Her hands down her pants  And I'd be French kissing  In fact I went out  With Molly on Saturday night  And she will tell you again  That I tried to make  A pass at her  Which I didn't  But she's very snuggly  So I actually did this  And rubbed her hair  You do it all the time  I know  So are you a lesbian  Bisexual  No  No  No  No  Curiosity  No I think 
[02:34:00]  See I can't just  Casually go on the radio  And go I try to  Put my hand down  Anthony's pants  Yeah  It just didn't work out  It's a double standard  For sure  Completely  It's not fair  It's one of the few  That women can do  You know  We were going to do  This story on these women  That go through like  Their whole lives  With men  Or they're married  And then you know  At their late 30s  They decide  Eh forget it  And they go out with women  And it's totally okay  They don't care  Yeah girls seem to  Have that thing going  That just lesbian gene  In there  Right  That sometimes it just  Kicks in  I'm trying to learn 
[02:34:30]  They're big chicks  Yeah  I'm trying to learn  Guys don't seem to have that  Where all of a sudden  You're going  You know I like girls  But I just want to try the cock  It's something  Just got to take a whack at it  I highly recommend it  It's not bad  We don't have that gene in us  So what's the show about  It's about  It's about big butts  And what else  I'm so sorry that you read that  I know  That's kind of queer  It's about  Who wrote this  We don't know  Who wrote the description  Not us  It's not helping you guys out 
[02:35:00]  Real life friends  I can already see  That you're a lot cooler  Than that description  Now are you real life friends  Before the show started  We are  I kind of  I kind of created this  When I was pregnant  And horny  And up all night  So this is where  This whole creation came from  Sherry and I used to work together  Doing traffic  And Molly and I  Went to college together  So we are all friends  Where's Molly  Oh  Molly  Well  Molly this is  She went to Buffalo  This weekend  And this morning  When she got on a flight  They asked her to get off  Because of weight restrictions 
[02:35:30]  And she's about 90 pounds  She's so little  Anyway she started  She had a problem with it  Because she wanted to make it  To you guys' show  And she cussed  And apparently in the state of New York  You could be arrested for that  So they took her off the airplane  And they threatened to arrest her  Because it's  Making a ruckus on a plane  She was making a ruckus  She's kind of excitable that way  Yeah  She's stuck in Buffalo  She's the problem right  Maybe  Yeah  We're here though  Yeah  Is Molly  She's 90 pounds  And there was a weight problem  What airline was she flying  Independent Air  Oh why would you do that 
[02:36:00]  Why  Independent Air  What is Independent Air  Shit it's awful  Why would you  It's probably a propeller plane right  She's actually coming home on US Air  So I don't think  Independent Air  Was her back  She got kicked off  Yeah  We're very paranoid of flying  Guys here are like airlines  That aren't bankrupt  And  Yeah  Yeah  Independent Air  Those puddle jumpers  They call them right  There's no reason to fly that  Well I don't think  Independent Air  Customer service  Top of mind right now  Because they've got  You know  The bankruptcy thing  Brewing  Yeah  A lot of cursing going on 
[02:36:30]  In the fuselage  That they are unaware of  Behind the back  That's what you're trying to do  Right  She walks by you go  You fucking bitch  Just make sure no one hears it  You don't want to get thrown off  That was Molly  It was the volume problem  Yeah  She can do it  She just needed to stay  Not one of those cool stories  Where she gets off  Because she cursed  And then the plane plummets  And everybody dies  No nothing like that  But there are children  With families  That want to testify against her  Oh really  Yeah  Seriously  I mean it's ridiculous  Wow  I know  You can't testify against the children 
[02:37:00]  That are screaming  When you're trying to read  My child  Or play  Yeah I know  Any kids  Well someone said  They were pregnant  Hope there wasn't a miscarriage  And I'm doing some  No no  I have a three and a half year old  Ah three and a half year old  Yeah  You keep them quiet  I gag  You try  I try  No he's a good kid  You're a courteous parent  I know every child  Is a great kid  Every child is beautiful  But I'll tell you  On an airplane  When you got a little kid  Behind you  It's a nightmare  That's why you bring 
[02:37:30]  Lots of candy  Anything that's going to  Keep them quiet  For the duration of the flight  And movies  I mean I'm not  Yeah I'm not above  It's called Valium  Yes it's called  The last Mesh  Yeah  On the last episode of Mesh  It's called  The chicken procedure  We have this feature  Called Murder Monday  Because I love murder so much  And I did this whole thing  On murdering moms  You know  Murder  And it's all about  Women that have murdered their kids  And there was this daycare worker  That every day  She gave the kids Benadryl  To get them to sleep  So she got the entire daycare to sleep 
[02:38:00]  And everybody thought  Wow she's this great daycare worker  Well she was drugging them every day  So one kid she gave too much  It killed them  So she had to shut down  Ah the jeans  Wah wah  Yeah that will put a damper  On your new admissions  That's odd you bring that up  Because we too  Have had a fascination  With women  Who kill their children  Really  Yeah we got something in common  Yeah  Well look at that  Only if you don't want to  Discuss it in a mature manner  Yes  I don't know if you'd find  The humor in it  That we somehow  Seem to  But somehow  The Andrea Yates tragedy 
[02:38:30]  Turns into  Five little empty boxes  Under the Christmas tree  And yeah  We would like to talk like that  That would be great  Yeah but I would think  The audience would probably be  A little  Well we have a song  By a nine year old  It's funny that we're  Mentioning this right now  A song called  Shelter from the Storm  Maybe we could get  Their take on the song  I have not heard this one  Well we should just  Maybe play it  We don't even need to  Like set this up  Play a little of it  Yes it's a nine year old

[02:41:30]  Shove it down your throat  Don't let them hurt your children  Who lets their children do that?  Yeah  See I need  I need everything in front of me  I can't do the show this way  Yeah  They're commenting on the song  And they're coming up with good stuff  And no one's bringing it down  But the song is blasting too loud

The parents?

And we're back  With the Opie and Anthony program 
[03:04:30]  That was a quick break  Broadcasting live  From Washington D.C.  In studio  Al Franken  Everyone  Sorry to make you wait  We had some  No no  We had some broads in here  We had some dames in here  They call their show  Broad minded  So we had a couple  Of the broads  A little play on words  Because they're women  I got it  Broad minded  Yeah  So Mr. Franken  How are you?  I'm great  Very good  You're quite the  Best selling author  These days 
[03:05:00]  I'm quite the best  Selling author  Yes  People buying your books  Up like crazy  I think half the people  That buy them  Love your point of view  And half hate it  I think it's more  Two thirds  But it'd be nice  If half the people  You think?  Well it'd be  Actually I get some people  Buying it  Who haven't decided yet  And that's nice  Or who  Actually are curious  Actually want to  Find out something  I like reading things  That get me angry 
[03:05:30]  A lot of times  You read and just go  Mother  This  No  Well there's a lot  Of that in this book  Is there?  Yeah  A lot of people  Are starting to say  That you're biased  To the left  Just a little  Who are these people?  A little left  And where are they?  I want to talk to them  A little left leaning  Well it depends  Where you are  But I mean I've read  Some of O'Reilly's books  Yeah that'll make you mad  And then Michael Moore's books 
[03:06:00]  Right  And I'm equally as pissed  Reading either one  Because it's so far  One side or the other  That it cannot possibly  Be based in fact or truth  It is just ridiculous  You know mine are  Maybe  Different than anyone else's  In that I have a particular thing  About lies and the truth  So I do a tremendous amount of research 
[03:06:30]  And also people on my shows  Or researching my book do it  So  And at least there's some humor thrown in  Yes  So that would be  Those two things would distinguish it  Certainly from O'Reilly  Yeah  Yeah where there's just  A complete lack of humor  At least I'll make you laugh a little bit  His private life is hysterical  All hell that  Yeah  No problem he had with the phone  Phone calls  Yeah he did a good job  Making that go away  His brains are just as strong  Yeah  Unbelievable  Yeah he paid her off 
[03:07:00]  So  Yeah  But didn't do anything  Didn't do anything  I'm just gonna say it  He actually never denied it  Yeah  He never denied it  But he never came forward  And said that he did it  No  But all he had to do  Was make a settlement  Pay a lot of money  And part of the settlement  Is that he never talked about it  Can't talk about it  That sure sounds like you did it  Yes  Yes I would say  And she had  She had what seemed like  A transcript  Yeah  Of a thing  Which  You know 
[03:07:30]  Leads me to believe  There is a tape  Somewhere  Somewhere  Which yes  Which leads me to believe  That's why he settled  Which  But anyway  That's you know  What's interesting about him  Is that he talks a lot  On his show about  Morals  Morals  And he talks about  Traditional values  Yeah exactly  And his traditional values  As opposed to  We were part of that  Secular  Leftist  Yeah  Yeah  Human  You know  And  And  He keeps talking about  His traditional values  And I don't know  What  What is traditional  About phone sex 
[03:08:00]  I didn't think the phone  Have been around long enough  To be a  You know  Maybe telegraph sex  Is a traditional value  But this is a guy  You know  A married man  Calling a female employee  Who doesn't want to be called  And making very very  Filthy calls to her  Yeah  That's not a traditional value  Where I  You know  It's a lot harder  My tradition  It's a lot harder  For the right  To preach  Their agenda  Because  They can come off 
[03:08:30]  Looking hypocritical  Very easily  By the life  They lead  Their personal life  And stuff  It seems to me  If you're more left leaning  No matter what you do  You go  Hey  It's part of the lifestyle  Man  Well no  I mean  Fuck and suck  And this  It doesn't matter  Is this  On  XM  Yes  I just figured  That out  Yeah  No  Here's the  I think  You can be hypocritical  Wherever you are  If you  You can be hypocritical  If you 
[03:09:00]  You know  If you preach  Being an environmentalist  And  You know  Litter  Invest in  Litter  If you throw a can  Out the window  I mean more of  More of a moral  Lifestyle thing  I think  Yeah  But I mean  There's plenty of room  For hypocrisy  All over the place  Yeah  Hypocrisy  Sure  Even you know  Liberals of course  Can come off  Looking very hypocritical  Yeah  So I wouldn't 
[03:09:30]  I wouldn't say  That they have  A lock on hypocrisy  That the right does  But there is  I mean obviously  Look  There's Limbaugh  Who for years  Would  When any  Drug addict  Would die  Would say  Just another  Dead doper  Good riddance  To you sir  Yeah  And anyone  Who uses drugs  Illegally  Should be put away  Should be thrown  In prison  And now  You know  And  Bill Bennett 
[03:10:00]  Likes to say  Like  I never  You know  Wrote  Against gambling  Therefore  I'm not a hypocrite  And I said  Well  Of course you didn't  Because you knew  You were a gambler  I know  Why are you  Going to put yourself  In that trap  But  You know  You were  You gambled away  Eight million dollars  There's something wrong  With that  It's a bit of a problem  Yeah  It's a problem  And by the way  You're  Empower America  Whatever your group said 
[03:10:30]  That  Did label  Gambling  As one of the things  That hurt society  And so you're a hypocrite  Sir  Yeah  You know  But anyway  So  None of us are perfect  Right guys  Huh  Right  Can we all agree  Is that a bipartisan agreement  There we are  There we are  Let's not point  You know  When you're pointing a finger  At someone else  There's three fingers  Pointing back at you  That's right  Absolutely  That's what I always say  Who do you want to see 
[03:11:00]  As president  Next time around  Are you four  Against Bush  I  How happy are you  That he's not looking good  At all these days  You know  I have to say  That I don't take joy  In our president  Doing badly  But it's great  No  He's just  So many things  Are coming home to roost  And it is sad  It is sad  That it has to happen  Because of people  Suffering in Katrina  I mean  This sort of opened  Everyone's eyes 
[03:11:30]  To how much cronyism  There is  And how  You know  After four years  After 9-11  How we didn't  Get anything together  And  And  And what's  And  And Iraq  Now  There's a thing  In the New York Times  Today  Saying he's going to  The New York Times  What's that  It's  It's actual paper  That you have  On your  On here  We read the  New York Post  See the difference  Between you  And us  We don't read any articles  Without a picture  Not enough pictures 
[03:12:00]  In that one  No picture on this one  It's just too big  To read  It said he's scheduled  To give a speech  In Annapolis, Maryland  On Wednesday  Assessing progress  Both in Iraq  And what he calls  The broader war  On terrorism  And several officials  Said he's expected  To contend  That the  Iraqi forces  Have made great progress  Now this is on the heels  Of a piece  In the Atlantic Monthly  By James Fallows  Who we're having  On our show today  Which says  That there's been  No progress  Or essentially  No progress  And you just can't 
[03:12:30]  Trust this guy  And I think  That's what people  Are getting  Is that  So if he goes out  And says  We've made a lot  Of progress  In building  This Iraqi army  And we're going  To be able  To leave  Just in time  For the 06 election  You know  Midterms  Yeah  I don't trust him  You know  And we're not  Going to cut and run  We're going to  Turn and tiptoe out  Yeah  Pull the old  Vietnam  Yeah  And it really  Worries me  I'm going over there 
[03:13:00]  Actually next month  I'm going  I do USO tours  Speaking of which  My wife asked me  She doesn't like me going  She says  You don't see O'Reilly  Going over to Iraq  And USO tours  And I say  Honey  That's not fair  He has no talent  That's what I say to her  That would dishearten  The troops  To bring morale down  Yeah  If they were too happy  And chipper over there  Then you send O'Reilly  He's just a pompous ass  Do you do the radio show there  Or do you just stand up  Or both 
[03:13:30]  I just do stand up  I do actually phone in  From  But you don't know  What your schedule's going to be  You can't do a scheduled radio  Jimmy did  He went over there  Yeah  He formed a few times  We did like a week there  Yeah  End of 2003  Where'd you go  We were in Baghdad  Kirkuk, Talil  Balad we couldn't land  Because the fog was too thick  So we spent two days in Baghdad  Just a week  Balad's Anaconda  That base  I don't know  We went down  It was like a hundred feet  They couldn't see the other way 
[03:14:00]  We went back up  Had to fly  You know  We hitched the ride  With Ricardo Sanchez  You know  Oh well  Then you're safe  Yeah  A bunch of  Double force people  Real men and me  Real men and you  Who were the other comics with you?  Colin and Laurie Kilmartin  Who was the writer  Great  Isn't it amazing doing it?  Yeah  I mean the gigs are fantastic  The soldiers are happy  That you're there  They're really happy you're there  They're really grateful  That you show up  Yeah  And you feel safe  I mean you're surrounded  By the U.S. military  Right  You feel  We didn't go though 
[03:14:30]  We flew only C-130  We didn't have any Blackhawks  I did Blackhawks  Which made me nervous  Yeah it's scary  Yeah I did  It's funny  After the first time  I went in 2003  And then I also went last year  But after I came back  I went around Christmas time  And in the spring  I was out in L.A.  The Friday before Oscars  And Ariana Huffington  Invited me to this big Hollywood party 
[03:15:00]  And at this agent's house  And there's all these A-list people there  Mel Gibson and Tom Hanks  And actually some people I knew  From doing Saturday Night Live  But they had been hosts  But at one point I got like  Literally overwhelmed by all this  And I went to sit in a room  By myself  It was a library  At this agent's house  And I sat down  And I heard  Hey  And it was Sylvester Stallone  And I never met him before  So I said  Hey  Sylvester  And he said 
[03:15:30]  Hey I heard you went on one of the USO tours  And I said  Yeah I did  He said  Yeah I was supposed to  But I didn't  And I said  Well why didn't you  And he said  I thought it might be dangerous  And I said to him  Well it's not really  Because you're with the USO  And they don't want anyone in the USO  To get hurt  And you're traveling  You're really embedded  Well let me ask you this  Was there any time  At any point  That you felt like  You might be in danger  And I said  Yeah I guess  The only times  Were when  We took Blackhawks 
[03:16:00]  From Baghdad  To Kret  And there had been  Some Blackhawks  Shot down  So I guess  Then I felt like  Maybe I had a  One in 10,000 chance  Of something  You know  He goes  Yeah that's why  I didn't go  And I said  Weren't you  Like fucking Rambo  In the movies  And he went  Well yeah  But I got a good life  You know  I don't want  You know  I like my life  But essentially  Yeah you're very safe  And my wife goes nuts 
[03:16:30]  For the three days  That I'm in Iraq  Because we also go to  We're also in Kuwait  And in Afghanistan  And I can't  And we're  Taking great care of  And I can imagine  What the family members  Of guys that are over there  For a year  A year and a half  Yeah sure  Not just a few days  So they must  And my wife was saying that too  The other day  Just yesterday  Because you know  She said  God I can't imagine  What it would be like  To be a family member  Of somebody over there  And I think it's worse 
[03:17:00]  For the family members  And for the troops  In some ways  I actually felt safer  In Iraq than I did in Kuwait  We were in Kuwait  For one night  Or a night and a half  Because Iraq is a war zone  Everybody knows  What's going on  But in Kuwait  You're in a hotel  Which is deemed safe  But it's like  You're in like  A Middle Eastern city  I just didn't feel comfortable  In Kuwait at all  Oh you're in a hotel there  Yeah yeah  See they put us on a base  There  We didn't stay there  No we stayed in a hotel  We're all bases  Was there a Starbucks there Jimmy?  There actually was  Absolutely there was  In a hotel  That didn't make you feel safe? 
[03:17:30]  That made me feel well  It's a Starbucks  I may be beheaded  But at least a latte  Will go down first  Yeah it was kind of horrifying  So who do you want to see  As our next president?  Did you answer that?  I didn't  Oprah Winfrey?  No  Some say it should be  What do you think of Joe Biden?  I like Joe Biden  I'd be more of a Hillary person  I'd be also  See you're throwing away your vote  You're throwing it away  No no no  It's a gimmick ticket  What?  Hillary 
[03:18:00]  She's not a ticket  She's a person  First of all  No it would be a gimmick ticket  Why is it a gimmick ticket?  She's an incredibly able person  And  Is America ready to  Elect a woman?  Yeah that's the  Elect a woman  Who they think is  That's the question  I think there's a lot of  Forget about women  I think there's a lot of people  That don't think  She's very credible  As an elected official  Never mind president  Why though?  Why?  You know  Why?  So there you go  I think she  She's become this picture of feminism 
[03:18:30]  And to be honest with you  What bothers me about her  Is she did  What any other woman did  What she did  Which is stay with a guy  Who was sleeping with everybody  Under her nose  And embarrassing her  And she stayed with him  And there's something about that  That really bothers me  It's like  If any other woman did it  They would be attacking her  As this 1950's housewife  Yeah  Yeah but because she does it  They're like  Wow look at her  She's staying with her  I don't know  First of all  I think  You might read that differently  I think that  Actually helped her  In a way  Is that she stood  By her man 
[03:19:00]  In an odd way  And  That's not  The sum of  What she is  I think that's a  In fact  She may have  The strong  You know  If she runs  And  In 2008  And  People say  Well I have a  I have a real problem  With Bill Clinton's  Personal life  She has the argument  Of like  You think you have  A problem with it  How about me  And they go  Oh yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  And I think  She's incredibly brilliant  Now I mean  There are other people  That I really like too 
[03:19:30]  I like  Barack Obama  Obama is probably  Too soon  For him to run  But I just  Think he's  Going to be  President someday  See here is why  The Democrats  Screw up  Year after year  With the election  For year after  For year  You guys  Gotta get  A legitimate  Candidate in there  Not some  Obama  Ain't gonna happen  I just said that  Hillary  Yeah I know  But even to bring it up  And Hillary  Just knock it off 
[03:20:00]  Find a credible  No Hillary beats  Any Republican  Except McCain  I don't think so  No way  I don't think so  I think for a woman  Name a Republican  Who beats her  McCain  No name a different  I mean name a Republican  Besides McCain  Who beats her  Strom Thurmond  Name a Republican  Who's alive  That beats her  Friggin Cheney  Would beat her  Oh my lord  No  That's how bad  That's how bad  It is  I think you don't  I don't think you know  I don't think you  I think you read 
[03:20:30]  You read your New York Post  I'll read my New York Times  The problem with a woman  Being elected  She'll have to be  A conservative I think  Because you're gonna get  I think to get  A crossover  You're gonna have  More liberal people  And thinking  The power of a woman  Being president  Is gonna be important  And crushing over  Than you will have  Conservatives going to vote for  You understand what I mean  I think for a minority  Or a woman to win  They're gonna have to be  Republican  Eventually  I understand that  And you put it so well too  Yes  I understand that sentiment  But I think she's 
[03:21:00]  I think she is  Very very well regarded  Certainly in the Democratic Party  And stands a good chance  Of getting the nomination  And if she does  I don't see a Republican  You've just named  Giuliani  Giuliani's not gonna get  The nomination  Well you're saying Republican  I think he could beat her  But he's not gonna get  The nomination  Well how do we know  You're right  How do we know  But he lived with two gay guys  So what  He's a good egg  I know but  Crossover helps out  With the  No no no no  But what I'm saying is 
[03:21:30]  Is that he's not gonna get  The nomination  Yeah  You know  They're not gonna  They're not gonna go  With the guy  I still think Giuliani  Could beat her though  I think credibility wise  Giuliani is seen as  This rockless ex-prosecutor  And the way he handled  New York after 9-11  And what he did for New York  And I think that his  Inaction in public service  Not that she's not sincere  Which I don't think she is  But people would argue that  But I do think  You don't think she's sincere  Nah I personally never  Never  Never dug her  I just don't  I haven't seen her  Do anything  I don't man  She's done nothing  That's how people vote though 
[03:22:00]  But she's never said anything  I don't dig her  Welcome here to  You know I like  Issues in focus  I think  Jimmy Carter's a sincere guy  Jim never dug her  It's nothing against her  But I think her  Her career motivation  Is  Oh you mean she's ambitious  Well ambitious  But it's more  It's more for herself  Than it is public service  I think  That's just  How she comes off  It sounds corny  But putting that Yankee hat on  It's almost like  You're not a Yankee  There's something about  Giuliani being a New Yorker 
[03:22:30]  And a Yankee fan  People feel like  Or at least this is the person  Who we're seeing  Well here  If you talk to like  Firefighters in New York  And by the way  I thought he did  It was masterful  After 9-11  But  And  I went to a number  Of  Services  Funerals  For firefighters  Because  Giuliani  Asked people to  Because you know  When a firefighter dies  Normally  All these firefighters  From all over  Show up  But we had  Several hundred die 
[03:23:00]  And so they had  One funeral after another  So Giuliani  Asked the public  To show up  So  My wife and I  Would go  Just went  Just as  Just to go  And I  And I saw him  At a number of them  And he was great  But  If you talk to  Firefighters now  They don't like him  Too much  And one of the reasons  They don't like him  Is  And  Is that he did  Nothing to get  Interoperability  Between radio signals  Between the police  And the fire department  Done  Between the first attack  On the World Trade Center 
[03:23:30]  And the second attack  And that cost a lot of lives  And I don't  I think if you really  Examine his record  Before 9-11  It ain't so strong  Again  I think he did  A masterful job  Afterwards  I  You don't think  He cleaned up  New York before 9-11  As far as the way  The shape it was in  Like with  You know  Just with crime  And the little  Quality of life stuff  That people called him  A Nazi for  I think those  Some of those were good  I also think  Some of them  Were started during Dinkins  I think that 
[03:24:00]  Community  Policing was started  During Dinkins  It was started  During Dinkins  It gave Giuliani  A lot of stuff  To clean up  Made New York  Look better  Well  Dinkins was  Oof  I remember driving  Into the city  When Dinkins was mayor  And nothing but  Squeegee guys  Porno shops  Which you know  Fine  I frequented  Quite a few  But you know  They wouldn't exist  Without people like you  Absolutely  But as far as 
[03:24:30]  You know  Bringing money  Into the city  And building  Well you know  You have to also  Remember that  I mean  Bloomberg  Has improved  Over that  If you  Yeah  And but also  That you know  Giuliani was mayor  During the  Clinton administration  And things really  During the  Clinton administration  Went very very well  For the United  For America  And for New York  Because of the  Markets  And stuff 
[03:25:00]  So a lot of that  Was really about  Economic forces  That had nothing  To do with Giuliani  Well look at all the  Koch years before that  When you look at  Koch and Dinkins  Just kind of like  The mess that it  Turned into  Well we had  Democrats running it  Well no  We had  We had  The crack  Epidemic  And  You know  And again  Community policing  Did start during  Dinkins  Which he doesn't  Get any credit  For at all  But that was  Toward the end  Of his  His term  I think Giuliani 
[03:25:30]  Was a really great mayor  And a lot of people  Will bring up something  Like the Brooklyn  Art Museum  Which he was wrong  To try to center  The art  And they'll say  Well that's who he was  But I think he did a lot  Of great things for the city  He's a Republican  I think that  On credibility  Well I just don't think  He's going to get the nomination  Because of  Who the Republican  Who votes in Republican primaries  And that's why I think  I think  I think that  McCain won't  But I'm beginning to think  That the more desperate  They get  They may turn to him  Yeah they kind of  Need somebody  They might need somebody  But looking at the field 
[03:26:00]  I don't see  Someone from  The normal ranks  Of who they would  Nominate  That would beat Hillary  I don't see  George Allen  Or Bill Frist  Or one of those guys  Well they can't pick anybody  That's really been  Kind of  Buddied  With  The president  And involved  In any of this  Shenanigans  With the war  If I may call them  Shenanigans  Shenanigans  Shenanigans has a  Kind of light feel  Yeah  Light hearted  Type of 
[03:26:30]  Oh the shenanigans  Oh yes  Oh the shenanigans  Going on  And Baghdad  Were you  Were you buying  Were you buying  Any of the  Intelligence  When it first broke  Yeah  You were buying that  I didn't think that  The presidents  Lied to you  Yeah  I was buying  Are you being serious  Yeah  Because Anthony  Was the same way  I was buying that  Like I can't stand  Bush now  And I was a big supporter  First election 
[03:27:00]  I believe Colin Powell  Yeah and Colin Powell  Had such credibility  With the people  Most credible man  In the world  Yeah  I thought  I thought  And he came out  When he came out  In front of the UN  And showed those pictures  And gave the speech  It was like  Wow okay  You know  We got to do something  And then afterwards  It's like  They found nothing  And kept finding nothing  And then the whole  That's when I just  Changed over  When the entire  Reason  For the war  Changed  Fuck the weapons 
[03:27:30]  It's not about that anymore  It's about  These people  Need to be free  Well  That isn't kind of  What you told us  In the first place  Because if it was  About freeing these people  I wouldn't have really  Been going rah-rah  And backing this  Because it seems to me  They really  Don't crave this freedom  They don't understand it  And Saddam seemed to  Rule with that iron fist  That kept terrorists  Out of his country  And now it's a clusterfuck  As they call it  Any ideas 
[03:28:00]  Because a lot of people  Say we got to  Stop the war  Somehow  Right  Even the democrats  Are saying we can't  Cut and run  Right  Do you have any  No one has a real  Solution to the problem  Do you have any ideas  Of how you get the guys out  But keep it from just  Anarchy after we're gone  Well we're close to anarchy now  I mean we're closer to anarchy  I mean there's another  It was a story yesterday  In this thing called  The New York Times  Yeah  About Mokdagar al-Sadr  Who is this radical Shiite cleric 
[03:28:30]  Didn't he start the whole thing  Wasn't he the one  Who was the original problem  He was one of the original problems  He was the original problem  In the south  In the Shia side  He wasn't the Sunni side  Which is  That was Fallujah  That was  That was also  The start of the problems  And  But Sauter  Yeah  His  His army  His militia 
[03:29:00]  Killed a lot of Americans  And now  He's going to be  On the ballot  He's going to be  Have 30 guys  On the ballot  As many as  The Dawah party  As many as  The Skeeter party  He's going to have  As many guys  On the ballot as possible  And they just killed  Like about  30  Like 30 Sunnis  The other day  Just in like  A massacre  Yeah  I mean  It's  It is  Friggin crazy over there  Now  I'm having 
[03:29:30]  James Fallows on today  He's written a piece  For the Atlantic  On  On  Getting the Iraqi military  Up  Because that's  The whole thing  Is like  We'll  When they can take over  We'll leave  Then that's what  We keep saying  But we're not  Serious about that  We have not been  Serious about  Training this army  And part of it  Was  Is that  We failed to  Recognize for a long time  Refused to  That we  Were facing an insurgency  And what we were facing  And so 
[03:30:00]  We wasted  The first year  And  We don't really  Put enough  Resources  And  Guys  Into training  And we don't have  Enough guys over there  We don't have enough guys  To both train them  And to  Keep things at bay  Essentially  Some gentleman  On  Meet the Press  Yesterday  See there you go  You watch Meet the Press  He says  Training  The Iraqi army  Seems to be  The selling point  Of the administration  Right now  We got to get them trained  Once they're up to speed 
[03:30:30]  We can leave  Then he brought up  A great point  That  No matter how well  Trained they are  They have to believe  In what they're  Fighting for  Once we leave  And  He doesn't really  See that happening  It's  You can give them  The guns  You can teach them  How to use it  But unless they  Really believe  In this cause  For freedom  And are united  Once we leave  They're just  Better armed  Insurgents  And  You know  Fractured  Pieces  Of governments 
[03:31:00]  And back to their  Tribes  And  Right  And then  Now you're  Screwed again  Even though  You trained this army  They just don't believe  In what they're  Fighting for  And I seriously  Don't think  They  They do  I don't think  They understand  What freedom  Is enough  To really  Have that passion  To fight for it  I think  Many of them do  And I think  When we first  Got in there  There were a lot  Of people  Who were just  Delated  The Kurds  Well the Kurds  Certainly do  For the people  Yeah everyone  That was being  Shit on  Loved it 
[03:31:30]  Well  That's true  I mean the  Shias  But a lot of that  Includes people  Who  It was like a  Majority of  Iraqis  And  We blew it  We blew it  By allowing  Looting  And by not  Getting the  Electricity up  And not  We just blew it  But let me ask you  The electricity  And stuff  Weren't they  Constantly sabotaging  Not that you  Don't have to  Overcome that  But it's not  Like we weren't  Trying to do it  It's like their  Own people are  Sabotaging  No but  But we  There's all kinds  Of pre-war  Planning that was 
[03:32:00]  Done that was  Ignored  That said that  They were going  To do that  That said  The first thing  You have to do  Is not allow  Chaos  And we allowed  Looting right away  And that  They did  Twelve billion  Dollars worth  Of infrastructure  Damage  During the looting  Is estimated  And that's  When we lost  Control of the  Country  And that's  When it  That's when  The insurgent  You know  The first  Bomb that killed  More than one  Person from an  Insurgent  Didn't happen  Until four months 
[03:32:30]  After the invasion  Did you think  Maybe that's when  Saddam got caught  It seemed like  A lot of them  Like what I  Want to know  Is once they  Realized Saddam  Hussein was  Not coming back  That's to me  When the country  Completely fell apart  It's like  Not that it  Wasn't happening  Before that  But that's when  They all went  Okay now we  Can do what  We want to do  Where was  Al-Sadr  I think his  Father was murdered  By Saddam  He declared  Where was all  The anger  And the militia  When Saddam  Was killing  His father  Where was  That the balls  Then  Where was this  Anger  Well he had  Because he had  Clamped down  That country 
[03:33:00]  With 500,000  Troops  We have  150,000  So in other  Words  They should be  Handled  Yeah  Well this  This is what  Our army  Was saying  Shinseki  Who the  Army chief  Of staff  Said we  Need to  Send 400,000  Guys in  There  And Rumsfeld  No I want  To transform  The military  And I can  Do this  With 100,000  Yeah  And Tommy  Franks  Finally got  Them up to  Like 150  Or something  They went  In there  And he thought  And they 
[03:33:30]  Called it  Mission accomplished  And they  Thought they  Had done it  And they  Really did  And I  Would really  Recommend this  Fallows article  In the  Atlantic Monthly  Maybe your  Listeners  Aren't  Smart  I wasn't  Going to  Say that  I was not  Going to  Say that  We got some  Smarties out  There  Yeah  Yeah  No and  Maybe they're  Not the  They're  They're not  The type  To read  That kind  Of article  Even though  They're  Brilliant  They  They  Prefer  To apply
