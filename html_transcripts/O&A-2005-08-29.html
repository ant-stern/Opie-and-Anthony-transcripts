<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast of Monday, August 29th, 2005, was a chaotic mix of Hurricane Katrina coverage, vulgar humor, celebrity gossip, and personal grievances.  The show opened with discussions about the media's over-the-top portrayal of Hurricane Katrina, mocking personalities like Geraldo Rivera and Larry King.  They juxtaposed these dramatic predictions with reports of relatively mild conditions in New Orleans, playing numerous news clips for comedic effect.  Live callers from New Orleans offered varied accounts – one, Tom, gave a rambling description from near the lake, while another shared a humorous anecdote about apocalyptic highway messages. A caller recounted stories from those sheltering in the Superdome, including a religious woman’s prayer.

The hosts then transitioned to a New York City story involving a woman who photographed a man masturbating on the subway and posted the image online, accompanied by crude and offensive commentary and discussion of the suspect, a restaurant owner.  This was followed by Jimmy recounting a humorous incident at Bahamian customs involving a radiation detector and a stress test.  The conversation quickly shifted to accusations against Howard Stern for allegedly stealing their bits, fueling a longer discussion about Stern’s alleged hypocrisy and cowardice for using management to silence them instead of confronting them directly. The potential for a Howard Stern roast was discussed, with Jay Leno, David Letterman, and Pat Cooper mentioned as potential roasters.

A significant portion of the show focused on the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs). The hosts critiqued the overwhelmingly non-white demographic, lamenting the lack of rock music and prevalence of rap and reggaeton.  They heavily criticized the violence and controversies surrounding the event, including the shooting of Suge Knight and altercations involving 50 Cent and Fat Joe.  This segment was rife with offensive racial slurs and homophobic remarks, interspersed with playing audio clips from the VMAs, including Diddy's hosting and 50 Cent's expletive-laden outbursts.  The hosts also expressed anger at Viacom (their former employer) for excluding them from presenting at the Spike TV Video Game Awards, detailing a tense meeting with Spike TV executives.  They further discussed Dane Cook's poorly-received VMA performance and briefly touched upon UFC fighter Chuck Liddell. A caller suggested a "clean" show, to which the hosts defiantly refused.  The show included a call from Boston Strangler from Whackbag.com recounting a prank involving Baba Booey and Wheelchair Fred.


The Hurricane Katrina discussion continued throughout, with the hosts mocking the sensationalized reporting from various news outlets, specifically Fox News.  They played contradictory news clips, focusing on perceived exaggerations regarding the Superdome damage and the overall devastation.  A running gag involved “pests,” listeners who engaged in pranks. Drew Curtis from FARK.com was a guest in studio, contributing news stories alongside Caroline from Louisiana, who offered a more grounded perspective on the hurricane's impact. A technical malfunction involving a staff member named Eric also occurred.

A lengthy, rambling discussion of Don McLean's "American Pie" followed, with the hosts and a caller, Kevin in Jersey, attempting to decipher the lyrics. The conversation veered into further criticisms of Hurricane Katrina news coverage, with the hosts praising MSNBC while criticizing others. A heated exchange with a caller, Mike in Oklahoma, ensued, including homophobic slurs.  The show featured a segment of listener-submitted “F.U.” messages,  more contributions from Drew Curtis (including unintentionally vulgar British place names and a story about a principal allowing students to use the "F-word"), and the emergence of the "Flying Spaghetti Monster" meme. The planned appearance of Don Vito and Ryan Dunn was cancelled due to missed flights. The show incorporated live reports showing the storm's effects on Gulfport and Biloxi, interspersed with bizarre and offensive comments, including a listener's sexually explicit audio fantasy about Jim Norton.

The show concluded with further Hurricane Katrina discussions,  Jimmy Norton’s exaggerated claim of Category 4 winds from his anus, and a caller's inquiry about portable satellite radios leading to a comparison of Sirius and XM. A played phone message detailed an emergency involving a listener's ex-girlfriend and death threats, sparking speculation.  The hosts mentioned missed interviews and the unexpected arrival of a Starbucks machine, attributed to the "pests." Discussion about an advertisement in a Sharp Rimage magazine occurred, before ending with several “Today I Learned” segments from callers containing crude and vulgar jokes, including jokes about the Superdome and defecation. A caller’s mention of people on CNN attempting to fly prompted more jokes and crude commentary, followed by an abrupt end to the broadcast.

[00:02:30]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I'm Opie.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're a despicable ass.  You're a despicable ass.  These dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby. 
[00:04:00]  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the coffee?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  Hello.  Ow, I'm really loud today.  I don't know what's going on.  I'm trying to adjust everything here.  What happened over vacation?  You are really loud. 
[00:05:00]  I'm booming loud.  There we go.  Did they adjust something?  Of course they did.  We are live, yes.  Give me a paper so I can prove it.  Because even during, like, the worst ofs, I thought we were live.  And I'm like, wait, we can't be live because I'm down here in North Carolina.  But no.  What day is today?  It is Monday, August 29th, 2005.  Come on.  Just talk about the hurricane.  Oh, yeah.  Hurricane Katrina.  Doomsday.  Look out.  Here it comes. 
[00:05:30]  Catastrophic.  Unbelievable.  This Fox News alert.  It's raining.  There's a little wind.  It's a windy day.  Oh, we got another alert.  Kind of drizzly.  My hair's wet.  Standing on a balcony.  These panicky peats.  Oh, they're awful.  Well, it's going to be a bad storm.  It's going to hit, what? 
[00:06:00]  Now they're saying just east of New Orleans.  Thank God it's taken a little turn to the east.  We don't think we're going to see the catastrophic damage that we had talked about last night for hours on end.  I was going to say, they've been scaring the shit out of us for almost two days straight.  And finally this morning, they're like, well, it's going to be bad, but not as bad.  It's not going to be the end of the world like we predicted last night.  And they were saying it was going to be the end of the world.  They were talking about New Orleans like it was done. 
[00:06:30]  It was going to be gone, washed away, never to be there again.  Hundreds of thousands of dead.  One guy was calling.  I mean, all the people I heard of from last night.  I was hooked.  I was watching it all night.  It's the best.  One guy was talking about that this will be our Asian tsunami,  which means I guess Rick will write a song about it and get fired.  But it will be our Asian tsunami with hundreds of thousands dead. 
[00:07:00]  He's talking about a toxic soup that will be there because of all the refineries and oil.  The oil tanks will dislodge from their mountings,  spilling gasoline on the surface of the water, which will cause fires.  If people stayed, their houses would blow away.  They would have to cling on to...  This is a guy talking.  I heard this.  Cling on to light poles, and then will come the fire ants, he said.  As you're clinging for life to a light pole, the fire ants will also need a dry place. 
[00:07:30]  The light poles.  And he says that the fire ants will win, and you will just be eaten by the fire ants.  So you're hanging on for dear life, and now you've got to deal with a fire ant biting your ass?  Unbelievable, these people last night.  The scene, the picture they painted.  And they're trying to make it sound like they didn't want it to happen,  but they're promoing this thing like it's a movie trailer, like an action movie.  Disaster is on the way. 
[00:08:00]  We are hours away from havoc.  Look, 30-foot seas in the middle of New Orleans will decimate the city.  Now, when you go to the movies and you see a movie trailer, don't you go,  Ooh, that sounds cool.  I want to see that.  So what they've done is condition everybody to want to see New Orleans get destroyed.  I absolutely was sitting there going,  The way they make this sound, I want to see this place get trashed.  I want to see...  You know, it's horrible, loss of life,  but the way they are promoing this like an action movie,  you don't watch a movie trailer, say, 
[00:08:30]  Wow, that sounds cool, and then not see the movie.  Right, you want to see...  I want to see the movie!  Yeah, with the grand finale.  I want to see New Orleans get destroyed,  because they pump this thing up like this.  I only want to see one thing.  The inside of the Superdome.  Oh, well, hey, disaster's one thing, Ovi.  You know, natural disaster, flooding, havoc, that's one thing,  but I don't want to see that.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  What a big tease they are down there in New Orleans.  They invite all these people that have never seen the inside of the Superdome 
[00:09:00]  to come take a look.  Did you see the line going into that place?  Of course I did.  Oh, my goodness.  Lock the doors.  Lock the doors for the next month,  and crime in that area will go down 200%.  Oh, Jesus.  Just put a padlock on the doors and call it a day.  Horrible.  Oh, is it a bunch of resin?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Let's just put it this way.  I guarantee out of all those people online to go to the, you know, 
[00:09:30]  to sleep at the Superdome for a few days,  none of them have ever been to a game.  You don't think they've bought a ticket?  I don't think so.  They're usually outside selling the cheap T-shirts,  and they scalp the tickets.  That's how filthy New Orleans is.  The storm doesn't even want to go through it.  Let's just make a ride.  Hit the ocean.  We'll go to a nice resort somewhere.  Come back in Georgia.  But then the news has the coverage of everyone just marching into the Superdome slowly but  surely, because they have to check every single person for guns and what have you. 
[00:10:00]  But then, Fox News alert.  Can the roof of the Superdome actually take this hurricane winds?  We'll be talking with an expert.  Then they started talking about how the roof could collapse under this wind,  and as they're just ushering people into this place.  Of course, Fox News had to talk about how the roof might collapse.  Just every disaster scenario.  They painted a picture that was horrific. 
[00:10:30]  Hell on earth.  Geraldo.  I was watching Geraldo last night,  and he was talking to people in New Orleans as if they were dead already.  I swear to you.  He's like, all somber.  Well, where are you right now?  I'm staying in my house, Geraldo.  Okay.  Do you have any next of kin you'd like me to notify?  He did not say that.  Dude, he was so somber and so, hang in there, man. 
[00:11:00]  We're pulling for you.  He was actually writing these people off,  talking about, and if I have to hear one more time,  how New Orleans is like a bowl.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  With Lake, whatever it is,  Lake Pabua Katrina, what the fuck,  is higher up than New Orleans.  New Orleans is below sea level.  And the Mississippi River on the other side above New Orleans,  and the Gulf of Mexico above New Orleans, 
[00:11:30]  and it's like a big bowl.  And the water is going to come in,  and 30 feet, Opie,  going to get 30 feet of water.  It's going to cover houses, buildings.  Get to the third floor, at least, of your hotel,  because there's going to be this flood.  So I tune in this morning.  I wake up, and I'm waiting to see just this movie scenario of flooding.  Oh, I couldn't even sleep last night.  I know.  I was all excited.  It was all the way to 11, 1130 last night.  I wake up in the morning.  I look, and I wait.  There was a guy standing on one of the streets in New Orleans, 
[00:12:00]  and he was near one of the gutters,  and he had his hand in the gutter,  and he was splashing what amounts to a puddle.  A puddle going,  well, as you see,  this could be the beginning of the flooding.  Flooding.  Dude, it was a puddle you would get on any rainy day.  Any rainy day.  It rained in New York yesterday.  We had puddles like that.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  There's the Superdome, huh?  Up to 9,000 people huddled at Superdome. 
[00:12:30]  Uh-oh.  No, they're just playing football.  Don't worry about it.  No, no, not at all.  I thought maybe there was some problems in the Superdome.  No, no.  No, it's okay.  Very frightened.  All is well at the Superdome.  All the people there.  No, it's okay.  Wow.  There are certain people that just couldn't leave the city, huh?  You know, this is the angle we have to take today.  I mean, if you want serious coverage,  XM has a channel, 247.  Yeah.  It's the emergency channel.  You know, I'm sure they're very dramatic over there. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, I'm sure.  If you really need drama this morning.  Yep.  But we've got to look at the silliness of this whole thing.  I just want to see one weather guy just be taken out.  I just want to see it.  Please.  One piece of sharp debris.  One guy.  Actually blunt.  Get hit by a Buick or something.  Please on live TV.  Please.  Because what school do these guys go to where they could handle a hurricane, but they're  telling everyone else to get the fuck out?  Get out.  It's dangerous.  I can handle it.  Me and my cameraman know. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  We know how to deal with this weather.  And they just stand there.  Well, they're showing a guy now, of course, in the heavy rain and winds.  You see the guys with the wind meters?  Yeah.  One guy, all last night, he's squinting.  Of course, he's standing with his face into the wind because it looks better that way.  It looks more dangerous.  But he's squinting and his hair is blowing.  And the cameraman is actually, dude, shaking the camera.  I'm not kidding you.  I watch this stuff with an eagle eye.  I love this stuff. 
[00:14:00]  And the cameraman was shaking the camera on purpose to make it look worse.  So the guy holds up the wind meter.  He's got his little wind meter.  He holds it up.  And he goes, all right, I'm looking.  10, 12, 15.  Dude, that's a breezy day.  It's a breezy day.  You made a good point in the office.  They should have someone just off camera throwing stuff at the weatherman.  Oh, would that be great?  He's just talking how horrible it is.  And a producer is just lobbing spaghetti colanders at him. 
[00:14:30]  Right, real dumb stuff.  Two by fours.  A baby.  A baby goes flying by.  All right, let's take our...  It was the worst.  We're going to take a lot of phone calls this morning because a lot of people have comments about this.  Let's say hi to Josh in Philly.  Josh?  Yo, guys, how you doing?  Hey.  Welcome back.  Oh, thanks.  What to say, 9,000 people huddled at the Superdome.  Only three are missing work.  Syndicate...  God damn.  The workforce. 
[00:15:00]  Everyone showed up.  It's amazing.  Well, we got a lot of audio.  Fox News from last night.  The main thing, and I've said it repeatedly over the past couple of...  Oh, we should tell people.  Shepard Smith on Fox News?  Yeah.  He's broadcasting, and right behind him is the balcony that we broadcasted from Mardi Gras.  Well, what is the hotel that we stayed at?  Royal Sinister.  Yeah, that's where he's staying.  Whatever it is, yeah.  That's where he's staying.  You can see that in the background, too, because we broadcasted about a block away from there. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  But I'm looking behind him going, wait a minute, that's the balcony where we saw a lot of titties.  Yes, it is.  And now he's doing a serious news report from his video phone.  Jimmy's a rotten fetus from Wack Bag.  He saw Geraldo last night, and I guess he said, good luck, bro.  To the residents of...  Oh, Jesse from Jersey also saying that.  Geraldo to the New Orleans residents.  Good luck, bro. 
[00:16:00]  All right, well, here's Shepard Smith from last night.  The main thing, and I've said it repeatedly over the past couple of hours from local emergency managers is  you have to have a go bag and you have to have a plan.  Again, that's from all the way, from Louisiana all the way into Alabama and Mississippi.  Tornadoes are coming.  A massive hurricane is coming.  Fires are possible.  This warning from local officials in New Orleans who say it could be 12, 14 hours of time when  emergency management officials will not be able to respond to emergencies within the Big Easy. 
[00:16:30]  Fires may go unattended.  Police calls may go unattended.  Ambulances may not be able to come, so they stress.  Be ready as you can.  The picture, they're painting.  And then Shepard Smith this morning kind of started tearing it down a little bit, saying,  well, here in my hotel room we're looking at projections with meteorologists and computer and radar,  and the eyewall seems to be breaking apart, the winds are down, the pressure is rising again,  so it doesn't look like it's all as bad as it's not going to be the worst-case scenario. 
[00:17:00]  Now, they were saying worst-case scenario last night, like it was definite.  We've got Larry King.  You want me to play this for you?  Oh, please.  Listen to what Larry King said last night.  If you saw an article in the National Geographic in October of 2004, that's last year,  it outlined what would happen if a hurricane, if a type 5 hurricane, class 5 hurricane, hit New Orleans.  Category, idiot.  And it would lead to the kindest devastation that would include building debris, coffins, sewage, 
[00:17:30]  a giant stagnation palm, maybe a million people homeless.  Let's check first with Dr. Jeffrey Halverson of NASA, severe weather meteorologist.  Is that a correct kind of fear?  Absolutely.  This is one of the worst-case scenarios.  It's kind of a doomsday scenario.  Very rarely have we ever seen nature conjure a storm this powerful in the past hundred years.  It ranks right up there with storms such as Camille and Andrew and Galveston. 
[00:18:00]  It is no way to soften the blow of this storm whatsoever.  It's packing the worst possible energy in terms of ocean, atmosphere.  And all imaginable energy.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  That's what I say.  Obviously, it's going to be bad, but, I mean, they just were hoping for the worst on TV last night.  Tim in Buffalo, what's up?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Hey, man.  You're saying that Paul wing it like a movie. 
[00:18:30]  Last night, I'm ready for bed.  Look over at my wife sitting at the TV.  I go, what are you TV-ing?  Oh, the news coverage.  I've got to see this.  This is sick shit.  Come on.  Yeah, people just get hooked.  Right.  They present it like a movie.  Paul on Long Island.  What's up, Paul?  9,000 golfers in a Superdome that can collapse.  Sounds like Louisiana has a plan to make.  All right.  What?  That's not what you want to talk about.  Bastards. 
[00:19:00]  Let's say hi to Bob in California.  Bob, what's going on?  Hey, all night.  Welcome back, boys.  Hey, all night last night, Geraldo kept asking people, so how does it feel?  You're going to be in a major American city.  He kept harping on that to people.  He was talking to at the Superdome.  Yeah, he was saying, he goes, it's so odd that we won't have Louisiana.  New Orleans as we knew it ever again.  He's totally writing the city off. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, bro, did you guys hear the religious nut?  No.  This is some great audio.  Jackie, the religious nut at the Superdome?  Oh, Superdome, okay.  We've got Superdome audio.  Let's hear this.  I want to talk to a woman over here.  I just chatted with her very briefly, seemed to have a great spirit.  Maybe she'll talk to me, maybe she won't.  Hey, dear, how you doing?  It's me over here.  Hi, Uncle.  You've had a great attitude about all this.  First of all, tell me your name, if you would.  Jackie Giselle.  Okay, Jackie.  I've seen people, some of them on edge.  I've seen some people not be able to take the heat out here. 
[00:20:00]  Some of the elderly needed to be taken away by medics.  And others seem to have really a good spirit about things like yourself.  What's your sense of thing?  We have to learn to put God first and accept that his will is going to be done, whether we want it to or not.  We've all been warned early enough to get out.  Now that we didn't, we should be grateful that we do have a place to go rather than blame our city,  because our city did give us enough time to get out, even though all of us can't.  But we still have to acknowledge that this is for our benefit. 
[00:20:30]  And did you choose not to go?  You couldn't get out?  I wouldn't leave my family.  I would rather stay here and die with my family if it came to that than leave and come back and bury my family.  You've heard the worst case scenario, and that is thousands will die.  Do you think that will happen?  Absolutely.  If there's a family that could get out or out.  Those that could not get out are already in.  It's just me out, because I'm just trying to keep everybody on a positive note.  That's all.  After spending several hours out here, what do you think about your fellow man? 
[00:21:00]  Everybody's coming together.  Everybody's in peace.  You know, this is all God's people.  We have different nations, all of us.  We're all in the same boat.  It really is quite a sight.  One is no better than the other.  We have people that have, people that don't have.  We have homeless people.  I have a good job.  But I'm still here, because I chose not to leave my family.  But I also knew that my city would provide a shelter, and God's going to protect me.  If he wants to, he will protect me.  If he does not, I can go in here and have a heart attack and die anyway. 
[00:21:30]  He's still got to come first.  And finally, Jackie, for those people watching who are not in the hurricane zone here,  what would you want them to be thinking about here, the people in New Orleans?  I would like them to think about repentance.  Think about the people that can't get out, those that are already out.  You know, if we just share God's word with somebody else who's scared,  there's a lot of people that are here because they're scared.  And when you get scared, you start to complain and murmur.  But if we focus on God and keep him first, we'll all be at peace, 
[00:22:00]  because nobody's going to die that he doesn't want to die.  That's the choice that they make.  And if that's disobedience to him, when he gave us enough warning to get out,  then we want to die.  Jackie, thank you very much for your time and sharing your story.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out,  and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:22:30]  Hello, exactly!  What the hell is she saying?  I have no idea.  We have another clip.  Very scary numbers there,  considering there are over 4 million people who live in the New Orleans area,  100,000 people stuck in New Orleans that weren't able to get out,  despite the three major roadways that do lead people out of the city.  So now this Superdome that holds 72,000 people,  packing with people who are basically once being told this is their last resort,  well, this is their only hopes of survival. 
[00:23:00]  They're all...  Oh, my God.  Stop it already.  Just stop it.  Their only hope for survival.  So basically, if you don't get to the Superdome, you're screwed.  You're dead.  That's basically what they just said.  It fits 72,000 people, 9,000 decide to go there.  Right now, we are getting some frightening predictions from the National Weather Service.  Forecasters say Hurricane Katrina could cause catastrophic damage.  I love that word.  They love the word catastrophic.  They were using that one all night long. 
[00:23:30]  Catastrophic.  Catastrophic.  Well, we have our old pal, Tom.  Tommy!  Yeah!  There he is.  This is Tom from New Orleans.  How you doing?  Our old program director when we were on regular radio.  It's blowing up pretty bad.  I'm going to go outside a little bit.  All right.  See if you can hear it.  No joke.  This is Tom live from New Orleans.  It's going sideways.  It just kind of stopped.  It comes in gusts.  You'll hear a big one when it comes. 
[00:24:00]  Like three trees are down.  Rain's going sideways.  Power's been out since about 4 a.m.  Tom, where exactly are you in New Orleans?  I'm kind of close to the lake, but I'm at my mom's.  They evacuated, but we came over here, me and a couple of buddies, and she's got a big  two-story house, so if the water does come in from the lake, when the backside starts  blowing, we'll just go up to the second floor.  Second floor.  They ran out of bottled water, but we got plenty of beer, so we'll be all right.  This just in.  Tom has plenty of beer. 
[00:24:30]  That's a Fox News alert.  Are you worried about running out of alcohol, Tom?  No.  That's why I didn't go to the dome.  They said no pets, no drugs.  And obviously no white people.  And no guns.  So if they were to ask me, I'd say, well, I don't have any guns.  Here's what I'm listening to.  Oh, oh, oh.  Exclusive audio.  The trees are like flowing completely on their sides. 
[00:25:00]  I've been through tons of these.  I've never seen it this bad, though.  Really?  I probably should have got out.  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  Do you think there'll be catastrophic damage, Tom?  Well, I hope all the strippers evacuated, if that's what you mean.  How are the levees holding up?  Well, I mean, there's no water in the street yet, but the wind just changed direction.  So now, like, all the water's blowing out from Lake Pontchartrain, so.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's starting to fill up a little bit. 
[00:25:30]  All right, you know what you should do?  Stand in the direction of the wind.  That's what I'm doing.  Where the rain is coming in, and open your mouth.  Okay.  Well.  All right.  Well, Tom, best of luck.  I hope you pull through.  I'll pull through.  Hey, where's the rest of your family?  They evacuated.  Where did they go?  Everybody evacuated.  Where did they go?  I stayed in Alexandria. 
[00:26:00]  My mom went to Lafayette.  My uncle and aunt went to Houston.  Tom evacuated in his pants.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  We're going to call you back, all right?  We're going to call you back when the eye of the storm hits.  All right.  Or is it hitting now?  I don't even know.  Yeah, who knows?  I'll give you a report.  It's pretty bad, though.  It's pretty bad.  Thank you, sir.  Pretty bad is what we're getting.  I've got to go get a break.  Catastrophic, too.  Pretty bad.  Let's go to Mr. Bogey, is it?  Mr. Bogey.  Hey, how's it going?  Are you calling from New Orleans? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, I'm calling from Covington, just north of it.  All right.  Hello?  Yeah, we're listening in, but...  How is it?  Pretty bad.  I'm watching a part of my neighbor's roof fly off, but he's an asshole, so we don't like  him.  A part of my roof just came off, too, but it's not as bad as it is.  Well, how far are you from New Orleans?  Maybe.  Uh, right now, I'm about maybe 40 to 50 miles north.  40 to 50 miles north.  Okay. 
[00:27:00]  And, uh, heavy rains?  Yeah.  A lot of wind?  Yeah.  A lot of rain.  A lot of rain.  Yeah.  What?  It's bad up here right now.  Yeah.  I'm not too far from where Tom's at.  All right, Mr. Bogey.  You have nothing to add.  You have nothing.  People right there in the eye of the storm and nothing, Opie.  All right, well, there you have it.  That's the latest on Hurricane Katrina.  Woo-hoo.  And if you want serious coverage, go to XM247. 
[00:27:30]  Uh, people are suggesting, because they've said, uh, New Orleans is like a big bowl, that  if, uh, it does flood, it's going to look like a giant bowl of Cocoa Puffs.  That's Hudson from Wack Bag.  Yeah.  Very funny.  Let's say hi to Tom in Pennsylvania.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, shit dick, shit chest?  How are you, Tom?  Hey, I was down on I-10 there.  I left Texas late Saturday night into Sunday, and, uh, there was a 200-mile backup all the 
[00:28:00]  way from Texas to New Orleans on I-10 there, and there was guys along the road holding up  the sandwich sign saying the Messiah is dead, and all of our sins are going to be paid for  now.  The end is here.  And one other thing, if the Superdome does flood, does that mean it'll be a big bowl  of giant, uh, shawiki jambalaya?  Oh, boy.  See, they don't know how to handle it.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Some people know how to do that humor.  Others, well, you just heard a call from one.  No clue. 
[00:28:30]  All right, well, we're going to take our first break.  All right.  We're back from vacation, just getting warmed up here.  We'll have more, uh, hurricane coverage.  XM emergency, yes, XM 247.  The Weather Channel, XM 125.  Fox News is, uh, XM 121.  CNN is XM 122.  Look at this graphic they're showing on Fox.  Huh.  Of water coming over the levee, flooding the city.  They're showing a computer animation they made, just showing 30 feet of water. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, it looks like they spent about 10 minutes on that.  Yeah.  Great graphics.  Looks like an old Tomb Raider game.  Oh, they'd love to make us panic.  Uh, let's say hi to Jerry in Minnesota, I guess.  Jerry!  Yeah?  What's up, Jerry?  Oh, not much.  Just wanted to report there's no flooding in Minneapolis right now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No flooding in Minneapolis. 
[00:29:30]  Nope.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure every city in America is taking the local angle.  Oh, yeah.  Will it hit us?  How will it affect us?  Blah, blah, blah.  If a hurricane hit our city, what would happen?  What would we do?  What would happen if, uh, yeah, a Category 5 hit us or whatever?  In Minneapolis?  Good luck.  All right.  Uh, first break.  We'll continue and, uh, blah, blah, blah.  We gotta talk about the story of the vacation.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This hit the papers, what, uh, two days ago, was it? 
[00:30:00]  I laughed.  I laughed so freaking hard.  I hope other people saw this.  This guy's a real trooper.  That's a huge New York story, and, uh, we'll let the rest of the country in on it in a  few minutes here, okay?  Oh, yeah, this is a good question.  Let's say hi to Rich in Chicago.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, I want to know where the attacks of the media are on the weatherman in New Orleans.  The assault on the media?  Yeah, and will that be an automatic weather for August?  Good opportunity.  Yeah, August is just about over.  We gotta crown a winner for the assault on the media contest. 
[00:30:30]  We got, what, two or three days left, and I think that guy in Alabama is still in  the lead.  All right.  Thank you, Rich.  Punch it out.  Someone's suggesting, uh, Paul's wife should head over to the Superdome.  Oh, my God.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  What, uh, what are, what are the recent hurricane names?  Emily.  They're still Lily White.  Was it Emily, one of them?  No, what are we up to?  Maybe she's D. 
[00:31:00]  Danny.  Oh, you got them?  What are they?  What are they, O?  Some of the ones we've had so far.  All right.  In 2005, uh, we started with Arlene.  Arlene is a very, uh, white name.  And it used to be all female names, and they had to be politically correct in the name.  And they had the guy names.  And I kind of like just having the female names.  Of course.  That's right.  Arlene, which is an old lady's name.  Yeah.  Brett.  Brett?  That's a cracker.  That's a white name.  That's a cracker.  That's a cracker.  That's a cracker name.  Cindy.  Well, okay.  Cindy's a whitey name.  Dennis.  Dennis.  Hurricane Dennis. 
[00:31:30]  Emily.  Came in with a sweater tied around its shoulders.  Do you really want Hurricane Rufus?  Rufus.  They didn't say black names from the 30s.  How about that?  Uh, silly.  Franklin.  All right.  Franklin's a black name.  It sure is, right?  Here's one that'll get a chuckle.  Another old lady's name.  Gert.  Gert.  Hurricane Gert.  Oh, Gertie's blowing.  It's like she did when the Kaiser was in charge.  It's like a giant diaper spinning.  Just shit and piss and forgotten memories flung all over the state. 
[00:32:00]  My God.  It's unrecognizable family members are being thrown all over the yard.  Hurricane Gertie's track.  Who's going to leave their home when they know Hurricane Gert is on the way?  No way.  Jesus.  It has no idea where it's been or where it's going.  Hurricane Gert can't get anybody to acknowledge it or talk to it.  It's a burden of a hurricane.  Hurricane Gert's complaining its family never visits.  According to Hurricane Gert, it's chilly again. 
[00:32:30]  Awful name.  Hurricane Harvey.  Harvey.  Hurricane Harvey.  Gee, I never knew the tsunami was so fast.  I got a Hurricane Shirley bigger than you.  Hurricane Irene.  Irene?  Hurricane Jose.  There you go.  There you go.  A little representation.  A little Hurricane Irene from a movie Goodnight Irene. 
[00:33:00]  Hurricane Jose does no damage but hubcap is blown off.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading.  Tell me we are all on drugs, yeah.  Never get it enough.  We are all on drugs, yeah.  Give me some of that stuff.  Ah, Weezer.  We are all on drugs. 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  We are back to the Opie and Anthony program.  A couple of people very pissed off at us, Anthony.  Why?  One lady wrote on the instant feedback, when 50,000 people are dead tomorrow, then you  could replay all these clips that you are doing today.  Why?  It will be funnier ones tomorrow.  I don't think 50,000 people are going to die.  Do you, Anthony?  I don't think so.  There's going to be damage and there's going to be, I would say, some loss of life, unfortunately.  A lot of people evacuated.  But, I don't know. 
[00:34:00]  The point we're trying to make is that they scared the shit out of us for two solid days  and this is a bad event, but it's not as bad as they were claiming it was going to be.  Right.  That's all we're trying to say, if you're thinking about it, really.  They were making it sound like the hurricane that was out in the Gulf was the same one  that was going to run over New Orleans.  Right.  Truth of the matter is, they always weaken when they come up on land like that, so.  All right.  Well, we have so much to do.  We've got so many updates to get to. 
[00:34:30]  We've been off, what, about 10 days or so?  Yeah.  And we're back, slowly but surely, getting back into the swing.  But, a lot of things happen while we're on vacation.  Excuse me, I got a cough on the plane.  Bastards.  Always get sick on the plane.  Always.  You didn't sit next to an Asian fellow, did you?  Oh.  No, it was some obnoxious guy.  I like JetBlue, but it was the first time I flew it.  But I don't like that you've got to sit next to somebody you don't know.  There's three seats.  So, if you go and you're a couple, there's a third person that's going to be sitting near you. 
[00:35:00]  And this guy was just all drippy-eyed and sniffly and coughing and there you go.  I get sick.  Bastards.  I love first class.  Two seats.  Nice.  You get your drink right away so the alcohol kind of kills any germs that are going near you.  Might be hanging out.  I want to read every single word of this story.  Oh.  I woke up Saturday morning and I got the newspaper and I laughed harder than I've laughed in a very, very long time. 
[00:35:30]  It's great.  They caught a perv.  This is a good thing about the advent of the camera phones.  They caught a perv on the R train.  The picture is up on opianthony.com.  Go there immediately if you haven't heard about this story yet.  Can you imagine?  You're a perv.  You think you're getting away with murder.  Oh, yeah.  And then you walk to your local corner store to get the newspapers and there's your face on the front page of the New York Daily News. 
[00:36:00]  Whacking it.  Labeled pervert.  Whacking it.  Jacking off on the front page.  Jacking off.  This story goes like this.  A 22-year-old woman used her camera phone to snap a photo of a man who exposed himself to her on an uptown R train and she has posted the picture on the internet.  So there she is, you know, on the train trying to get somewhere.  There's the perv across the way.  He decides he has to pull out his penis.  And he's whacking it.  He's jerking off. 
[00:36:30]  And he thinks he's getting away with it.  And she pulls out her camera and click, click.  Takes a snapshot.  I'm thinking she might even, like, kind of, like, lured him in a little bit.  Like, you know, hey, I got a camera.  I would love a picture of that.  It's all smiley and stuff.  You think?  I'm thinking.  And he's just jacking.  Jacking, thinking, well, the girl's cool with this.  And she wants a little souvenir of the event.  Well, the site has already had more than 45,000 hits.  This was from Saturday. 
[00:37:00]  I bet you this site has well over 100,000 hits now.  Oh, of course.  With one woman leaving the message, I hope his mother sees it.  New York cops say the quick-thinking woman did get a great shot of the guy.  They hope someone will recognize him.  The flasher must at least be camera shy after his picture was taken.  He fled the train at the next stop.  Yeah.  The photo was originally posted at Flickr.com.  We now have a link to it on opiananthony.com with the following explanation from the young woman.  This happened to me today right after an interview I had. 
[00:37:30]  Luckily, I landed the job, so I was in a pretty defiant mood.  I was riding on the R train uptown at 3 p.m. on Friday, August 18th,  when a man exposed and began molesting himself on the train.  Is that molesting yourself when you do that?  Interesting.  Pleasuring.  He's just jacking off.  Yeah, it's pleasuring.  It was at the very end of the train, but it wasn't completely empty.  It was at the very end of the train, but it wasn't completely empty.  A Japanese couple sat on the other side, and the man was sitting adjacent to me. 
[00:38:00]  I was minding my own business, taking the train to work as usual,  when this man got on the car and kept staring at me.  I tried to avoid eye contact with him, but I had a feeling he was up to no good  when he kept massaging his crotch.  That's a sign that you're up to no good.  I couldn't believe this guy had the audacity to do something like this in the middle of the day,  so I took out my cell phone and turned on the camera.  Then I aimed the camera at him and took a quick shot.  He quickly zipped himself up and got off at the next stop.  That didn't prevent me from getting a really good shot of him in the act. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, this shot that you can see on openanthony.com, you see his junk in mid-stroke, it looks like.  Oh, yeah.  Afterwards, I asked the Japanese couple if they saw anything.  They saw the man, but they didn't notice what he was doing.  I felt compelled to report this to the police so that it would prevent this from happening to other women.  I said that if they did see anything, then they could help me go to the police and write in the report.  I got off at 34th Street and reported to a token booth operator.  She was very helpful and directed me to a policewoman.  The policewoman wrote down my description, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:39:00]  It goes on and on.  Okay.  I guess that's from the journal, huh?  I actually wanted the story.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, this is from the website.  This is the website journal.  I actually wanted the story from the paper that appeared in the Daily News on Saturday.  Yeah, this is her whole.  Yeah, because it goes on and on and on and on.  I just want the story that appeared in the New York Daily News.  We asked for it all morning.  Can I please have it?  Well, Opie, if you would have asked for the story, maybe you would have gotten it. 
[00:39:30]  Obviously, you asked for this, didn't you?  No, I did not.  Where's the story?  No, by asking for the story, you must have asked for this, because I heard you ask for the story about three times.  And this is her, like, this is her diary of the whole event.  This is her babbling.  Just because she took a picture of a guy jacking off doesn't mean you want to hear her babble.  I've done that many times to myself and sent it out to the girls on the net.  Sure.  And if I knew how to get on the damn web through this stupid computer, I would just get it myself.  It's a hurricane, Opie.  It's interfering with computers.  So get me on opieandanthony.com. 
[00:40:00]  The story's up there.  This...  Oh, my God.  Well, glad to see not much has changed since we've been on vacation.  Takes a little while to get back up to speed, Opie.  Perhaps that's it.  People are in vacation mode.  Isn't this the story, or no?  Or is this the same shit?  That's the same shit.  That's not the story.  Oh, boy.  This is the story of the vacation.  It was in...  And how it was written in the Daily News was priceless. 
[00:40:30]  In the Daily News.  Absolutely priceless.  I got the news story about it.  Well, yeah, well, I...  Well, we have an update, but I want to do the original story first.  It's because, you know, we are a national show, and there's people all over the country  that have not heard about this yet.  No.  Can somebody go on the DailyNews.com and possibly get the story off of there?  Oh, good luck finding it on that.  It's just punching.  DailyNews.com stinks.  Yeah, I know.  It takes forever to load for some reason.  The post comes right up.  Daily News.  Maybe under search, you have to punch in some keyword. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, I think somebody on instant feedback might have helped us here.  Oh, really?  Let me try to pop.  Maybe they can produce the radio show.  Maybe they can sit in the studio to my left.  But I'm to your left.  You're across from me.  No, the guy just sent us the new story.  The update.  Well, yeah, but we want...  We'll do the update after we do the original story.  That's how it works. 
[00:41:30]  Great.  Everyone's scrambling now.  Oh, you've ruined it.  You've ruined it already.  See that?  It was supposed to be good.  And now too much time has passed.  The eye wall has disintegrated.  The pressure's rising.  Did you hear about that in New Orleans?  Yeah.  I feel like I made your problem.  Dude, I'm so out of touch.  I just...  I really was very unaware of the storm hitting New Orleans until I came in here.  You really had no idea?  No.  That's you.  That's what I know for.  You just don't pay attention to anything but yourself and your sexual addictions. 
[00:42:00]  Fool I am.  It's just a hurricane of jism in your room.  It was about an it.  And by the way, the fact that...  It's a little Jimmy.  Steve has the crew cut and the glasses perched up on the top of his head, and I want to remove  them with a bat.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Can you get that again, please?  I thought I'd be excited to see you all.  No.  At the vacation.  Not at all.  I need another week away. 
[00:42:30]  I was kind of happy to see you guys.  I wasn't happy to see any money.  No.  I'm happy to see the crew.  I had a good taste of what retirement will be like, and I liked it a lot.  You had two years of retirement.  You didn't like it.  I spent time with you.  It was awful.  Yeah, but now we've been back a while.  No.  Now we can leave on our...  Back long enough.  Now we can leave on our terms.  Hunt Perv caught in a flash.  Let's try this version of the story, okay?  Make believe you didn't hear anything I said because that was from her diary.  I knew we were going to have a problem when I picked up the thing that I thought was 
[00:43:00]  the news story, and it was like 10 pages long with very small writing.  I'm like, no newspaper will print all this crap.  What happened?  All right.  When a pervert exposed himself on a Manhattan subway last week, reached for her secret weapon,  her camera phone.  Is that her name?  Something like that.  Chang Chang.  Just make some kind of model airplane noise.  That's her name.  Mang Chang.  Mang Mang Mang.  The quick thinking 22 year old.  I'm going to point to you every time they mention her name in the paper, and you can do 
[00:43:30]  the model airplane noise, okay?  So let me start again here.  When a pervert exposed himself on a Manhattan subway last week, reached for her secret weapon,  her camera phone.  The quick thinking 22 year old snapped a shot of the smirking sicko, took it to cops, and  then posted it on the internet.  See how much better this story is already?  Nice.  A word of her campaign to nail the flasher, raced through cyberspace and more than 45,000  people have viewed the photographic evidence by last night. 
[00:44:00]  I just hope they catch him.  Mang Mang Mang.  Mang Mang.  Told the Daily News.  Maybe someone will recognize him.  Maybe it will stop other people from doing it, she said.  Maybe other women will use their camera phone to stop crime.  Mang Mang Mang.  Mang Mang.  Mang Mang.  Transformation from quiet web developer to feisty crime fighter happened on an uptown  archery in the afternoon of August 19th.  She was on her way back to work after a job interview, and a middle-aged, blonde-haired  man dressed in a black shirt and jeans sat down across from her. 
[00:44:30]  He kept staring at me, she said.  I could feel his eyes on me.  I wanted to avoid eye contact, so I looked away, but I could see his reflection in the  window.  I saw him massaging himself, and then he unzipped and pulled it out.  I thought, I can't believe he's doing this in the middle of the day.  At night would be fine.  The subway car was mostly empty, and...  The second.  Jesus.  It didn't have her middle name in that part of the article. 
[00:45:00]  The plane was doing a loop.  Oh, the subway car was mostly empty, and...  Mm-mm.  Felt nervous, so she pulled out her Samsung P777 cell phone equipped with a 1.3 megapixel  digital phone.  Ooh, 1.3.  I turned on the camera, she said.  He was still masturbating.  I aimed it and quickly took the shot.  As soon as I took it, he zipped up and got off the train.  Said she was disgusted by the incident and immediately reported to a police officer at 
[00:45:30]  the 34th Street Station.  The next day, she filled out an official complaint, and the following day, a detective had her look  at hundreds of photos of ex-cons.  None of them was the culprit, but...  Wasn't about to give up.  She posted the degenerate's photo on the website Flickr and Craigslist, and bloggers began  linking to her site.  Her photo and story drew a few juvenile snickers, but most of the comments have been positive. 
[00:46:00]  One...  Oh, no.  One netizen wrote, sorry.  You go, girl.  Another commented.  I hope his mom sees it.  The NYPD, which confirmed...  Had filed a complaint.  Also was impressed.  It's great she took the picture.  It'll help with the investigation.  If I can be...  If it can be done in a safe manner, it'd be helpful to locate the suspect.  They're talking about other people possibly using their camera phones to, you know, to shoot 
[00:46:30]  pictures of crimes taking place.  You're taking your job a little too seriously.  Had it started.  It stopped.  Ran out of gas.  This is the first draft hanger to use their cell phone to catch a criminal, and then it  goes on and on.  So basically, there's the story, and the front page, the Daily News took a very brave stance.  They decided to print the picture on the front page of the Daily News on Saturday. 
[00:47:00]  What a waker-upper when you're having your cup of coffee.  That's me jacking off on the front page.  And there's no, like, you know...  Well, it looks like I know it's me, but I don't think anyone else would know it's me.  No.  No, it's pretty much very obvious.  It's you jerking off on the front page.  So if you haven't seen the picture yet, go to opianthony.com.  It's up there in all its glory.  So we have an update today in the paper, New York Daily News.  Are you ready?  Because I think her name's in this paper as well. 
[00:47:30]  Ooh.  Cops want to question a Manhattan restaurant owner after getting numerous tips...  Numerous tips.  ...that he's the subway flasher caught in the act by camera phone, police sources said last  night.  Nearly two dozen people have phoned the Daily News and the NYPD to say they believe Dan Hoyt.  Good old Dan Hoyt.  Danny.  Co-owner of Raw Food Eateries called...  Raw Food.  Quintessence is the man whose photo appeared on the cover of Saturday's newspaper. 
[00:48:00]  Phew.  Good old Dan Hoyt.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Who thought he got away with something.  Investigators contacted Hoyt by phone and asked him to come in for an interview, NYPD sources  said.  No arrests have been made.  Hoyt did not return the news calls and his business partner and ex-wife said it's not proven  yet.  She said whoever the flasher is, he needs counseling.  Yeah.  There should be a support center to support these men to find what is the cause of their 
[00:48:30]  action instead of putting them in jail, she said.  Hoyt and Chan co-own two restaurants.  He was married to an Asian girl?  Looks like that, yeah.  Yeah, see, he's into Asian girls.  Tolent and Chan owns a restaurant down there in the East Village and somewhere else, I guess.  The photo appeared in the news after thousand, oh, that's your part.  The photo appeared in the news after 22 used her cell phone to take a picture of a blonde  haired man who exposed and finally hit himself on an R train on August 19th. 
[00:49:00]  Two other women who saw the picture, which was also posted on the internet, have come forward  to say they were flashed by the same man.  Rats.  When it did happen to me, I was in shock, said a 31-year-old Manhattan woman.  It's a violation of my space and my sense of safety.  It angered me.  He thought he could get away with it, she said.  We've talked to a lot of women, and they said that it's more silly than anything.  Right.  It's not a violation of space or any of that, as long as this creep isn't approaching 
[00:49:30]  them and trying to go further.  A lot of women, I'm just talking for them, that have called in the past, because we've  talked about this every once in a while.  They think it's goofy.  They think it's just plain silly.  Silly.  And that it looks right.  Of course.  She said the man flashed her twice in the past six months, both times on the one in  nine line.  Jesus.  She said the man flashed her twice in the past six months.  Same guy.  She saw this guy twice in the past six months do this to her.  This was another woman that came forward.  I know that face and remember that creepy smile, she said. 
[00:50:00]  What a surprise to see his face on the front page of the Daily News.  I am grateful for Mrs.  Quick Thinking and hope this man gets caught.  Let me ask you a question.  Has it ever worked?  Has there ever been a time where a guy yanked his dick out on a train and a woman went,  oh man, I gotta suck that.  Right.  That's never.  Never worked.  Never, ever.  Why would you do it?  Well, I don't think you're pulling it out hoping that the chick's gonna suck it.  Well, you think she likes it.  I think you're pulling it out because you want to shock someone. 
[00:50:30]  Like, look what I'm doing.  Really?  That's what I'm thinking.  You think if she came over and said, let me hook you up?  She's gonna suck his dick right on the train?  You think if that happened that the guy would be like, ew, get away.  I just want to shock you.  I think it's...  Or you think that would be like, oh my god, I can't believe it finally worked.  So you're thinking rationally.  He's not rational.  Right.  Oh my god, they already have photoshopped your head on...  Ah, there it is.  The creeps photo.  It is deeply disturbing.  I believe that will be on whackbag.com under the photoshop section. 
[00:51:00]  There you go.  There's Jim Norton on the train.  Whacking his bag on the train.  Whacking his bag.  My dick was that small.  I deserve to have my face on the cover of the paper.  Guy's packing like four and a half.  His hand covers the whole thing.  So, I don't know.  You think that these guys do it hoping that they're gonna get some action out of it?  I don't know.  I don't think they think it through, obviously.  But it's like, you have to think that the other person is getting something out of it.  You probably think, like, I'm just gonna show her this cock.  Yeah, she's gonna love it. 
[00:51:30]  Because you're in your own sexual addiction.  You're in your own sick place.  So you're thinking that they're gonna be into it, too.  Because, you know, you're watching pornography.  And every time you yank a cock out in porn, someone takes care of it.  I don't think he's thinking it's gonna happen.  But I think he's hoping.  I think he's really, like, hoping maybe, you know, one in a million is gonna...  Do you really think?  Maybe irrationally.  He probably...  I know he doesn't expect it to happen.  No.  But if it did, he'd probably be very happy.  He'd be very happy, yeah.  He's not expecting it.  Yeah.  All right.  That's great.  But you can find the photo up on opianthony.com. 
[00:52:00]  It's getting a lot of hits.  Whacking it.  We got John in New Orleans checking in.  John, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, buddy?  Hey.  Hey.  I think I speak for the city of New Orleans, and I'd like to say your mom's box.  Oh.  Is it bad?  Oh, it's a fucking nightmare.  I haven't even been close yet.  Really?  Let's see.  30,000 golfers in the Superdome with no power.  You tell me if it's bad or not.  Oh, Jesus.  There's no power in the Superdome?  Oh, that's correct.  Supposedly they lost power at the Superdome.  They have the generators up, but it's only for emergency lighting. 
[00:52:30]  And I hear it's only 9,000 people at the Superdome.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  It's more like 30.  They confirmed it on the news.  Yeah.  But it's a mess.  The hospitals have water in them.  So, by the way, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  How far are you from New Orleans?  About 50 miles.  50 miles, yeah.  I mean, we're not denying it.  It's obviously a huge weather event.  But you've got to make fun of the news for making it even worse than it is.  Oh, there's fucking douchebags all over the place down here.  Right. 
[00:53:00]  You know how awful those toilets must be in the Superdome?  Ugh.  They're not prepared with food.  No.  Did you get everyone sleeping on the 50-yard line?  You've got to just stink in there.  It must be awful.  Everyone's sweating.  All right, let's say hi to Rob in New Jersey.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, I wonder if the guy on the train pulled his dick out and used the old Jay Moore line.  Hey, now what are we going to do about this?  What are we going to do about this?  Take your picture and put you on the front page, idiot.  It's just great, though, that the picture was on the front page of the Daily News.  That's courage.  It's August. 
[00:53:30]  We could have warned them.  Bad time to do that, sir.  Yeah.  That's how you know there's not a lot of news going on.  Guys jerking off on the front page of the paper.  Front page.  Pretty brave of the news to take that bold move and then throw it on the front page, by the way.  Worse than opi and opi.  I don't even think the Post even covered the story.  They didn't even cover the story at all.  Really?  It was like a Daily News exclusive, and the Daily News ran with it.  Jeremy in D.C., what's up?  Hey, I was just calling to tell you that I have a friend who successfully masturbates in front of other people on the subway all the time here. 
[00:54:00]  Really?  He tells you this?  Yeah, he tells me it when it happens.  He acts like he doesn't do it all the time, but once in a while he tells me that he's done it today and that he's done it.  You're a friend of mine?  No, I'm serious.  The thing is, he's gay and he does it to other guys who go in for it, so that's why it's kind of different that way.  I think the listeners went on vacation, too.  Yeah.  They're having a little slow time getting back.  They're having a tough time getting back into the groove as well. 
[00:54:30]  All right, Jeremy, thank you.  And now Jeremy's mad at us.  Yeah.  Jet Blue Pest.  You.  What's up, buddy?  ONA, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Yeah, Anthony, your girlfriend didn't look too happy when I was yelling ONA Party Rock there at the gate there.  Oh, is this Steve?  Yes, this is Steve.  Steve.  Yeah, the stuttering prick.  Steve works for Jet Blue.  He was at the gate when I was walking in, and he goes, ONA Party Rock.  And then he asked me to sign something, so he, like, printed out some kind of receipt, and I signed it, and everyone's looking on, like, 
[00:55:00]  why does this guy have to sign something to get on the plane?  They were all horrified, like I was some kind of terrorist, and had to sign something to get on the plane.  You are a Middle Eastern-looking creep.  Oh, I know.  A little co-tape.  Terrorist.  Horrible.  He set off an alarm, too, he was telling me in the office.  Oh.  At Customs in the Bahamas.  I'm walking through, and I had my stress test, like, two weeks ago, and they pump you up with some kind of radioactive isotope, 
[00:55:30]  and you get on the treadmill and tear it up, and then they take the pictures of everything and make sure everything's cool, you know, totally cool.  And it was, like, two weeks ago, and I go through Customs, and the Customs inspector, he's got, like, a beeper, and it starts going off,  and I'm pissed because I think he's going to make a phone call, and he goes,  did you have a stress test within the past couple of weeks?  And I'm going, yeah, how do you know?  He goes, you set off the radiation detector.  That was his radiation detector. 
[00:56:00]  Beeping.  That's great.  Now we're all in here.  Irradiated.  Thank you, man.  I was irradiated.  That's great.  Nice to know it works.  Yeah, great.  We're going to come in with our hair falling out tomorrow.  Yeah, right.  You're healthy as a mule.  Nice to know it works.  It's like, wow.  But they just go, okay, go through.  I could have had some kind of nuclear stuff on me.  It's nice to know, though, that that's working.  It actually worked.  It actually works.  Okay.  We'll take another break here and regroup.  We've got to talk about the assaults on the media that happened during vacation. 
[00:56:30]  I saw some of those.  A couple of them just missed, don't they?  Howard Stern, the biggest hypocrite in radio, blatantly taking another one of our bits.  But he invented everything.  Of course he did.  That's right, Robin.  The attack will begin very shortly with him.  Fucking douchebag.  Ass head.  There was something else.  Oh, we'll attempt to talk about the VMAs after the break as well.  I thought they were showing a clip of the VMAs, but it was the Superdome. 
[00:57:00]  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Knee, man.  Knee, man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  I broke my knee, man. 
[00:57:30]  Fuck.  Hold my hand, man.  Ah, you mother.  Hear me again in the media.  XM202.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:58:00]  Feeny, feeny.  We're keeping an eye on Hurricane Katrina for you.  Of course we are.  If you want serious hurricane coverage, go to 247 on your XM dials. 
[00:58:30]  Elo says they could get a little wet.  Hi, Elo's all over this one.  Location check.  We're going all night long to everybody.  All night long.  So, there you have it.  In between the hurricane coverage last night, I was trying to watch the VMAs.  Yeah, I didn't catch any of it.  I couldn't tune away from the hurricanes.  My only comment about the VMAs is basically this.  Where are the white people at?  Not at the VMAs. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, that was...  Wow.  What happened?  Did we finally officially get old is what I have to ask this morning.  What the fuck was going on?  It's all about the hip-hop.  It's all about the rappers, the gangsters, the shooting.  The hip-hop, and then you got the Spanish hip-hop, whatever that's called.  That's like the hottest format in radio these days.  Is it?  Yeah.  Very fast-growing population.  I believe XM has a channel or two dedicated to this new music genre. 
[00:59:30]  Maybe someone can help us out.  I don't know what it's called, but it's basically Hispanic hip-hop.  Shiftless 215?  No.  It's absolutely huge.  Humble joke.  But, you know, every year I look forward to the VMAs, and I tuned them in, and...  Less relevant, isn't it?  Holy crap.  But they started off nice with Green Day. 
[01:00:00]  Green Day was great, doing Boulevard of Broken Dreams,  and then it got really dark for many hours.  Oh, jeez, really?  Well, I imagine Green Day was also threatening to unveil, threat to shoot somebody.  That's what rock stars do.  They kind of threaten to shoot each other, and they talk shit about each other.  That's what they do.  The roughest it ever got between white bands was, what, Axl Rose?  Had a little scuffle backstage.  With Kurt Cobain.  Was it with Kurt Cobain?  Right, was it?  Vince Neil and him had one.  Yeah, Vince Neil, and then someone else from Guns N' Roses kind of went after it. 
[01:00:30]  Like, that's it.  It's a scuffle.  A scuffle.  It's a rock fight.  Bunch of fags with their blonde, poofy hair just going at each other.  Punching with one arm so they don't spill their beer.  Yeah, that's what you should have back there.  Well, Suge Knight, oh, he was shot at a VMA party the night before down there in Miami  and taken to the hospital.  Boy, what a trooper he is, huh?  He's a tough dude, man.  What a tough guy.  There's a photo of him in the paper standing after he was shot. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, just shot.  It was the hottest party in Miami, too.  Yeah, a lot of people were there.  This was like the exclusive hot party.  Alba.  Yeah.  Was there.  Who else?  A lot of the celebrities were there.  And shooting.  Why?  Why are they shooting each other?  Suge gets out and drives himself to the hospital.  He was just pissed.  He was just annoyed.  Put a hole in my suit, motherfucker.  That guy's a problem.  Why would you fucking do that?  If you're going to shoot somebody, why would you shoot him in the leg and then run away? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Someone said he shot himself.  Really?  By accident.  That's one of the theories.  Yeah.  That are floating around that his gun went off accidentally because they can't find a shell  casing.  That would make more sense, right?  If it's a leg.  If he had his piece on him.  But he's already quoted in the paper that he's basically going to kill the person that  shot him.  It's like this guy has no fear whatsoever.  Well, the guy that actually shot him was interviewed last night and they got a clip  of why he shot Suge.  All that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with a shovel. 
[01:02:00]  I want to make it perfectly clear that Anthony, who sits to my right, hit his instant replay.  What?  It's Blazing Saddles.  It's a famous movie.  That would be Anthony.  Oh, well, they have a...  Don't you understand that the only people that have satellite radio so far are truckers  and everyone in Hollywood?  Laugh at this stuff.  I think they have audio from the club that night.  Robert, I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town. 
[01:02:30]  Eric, stop hitting the buttons.  Sorry.  And, uh, Suge didn't sound too tough in this clip.  Oh, Lordy Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he's saying.  Do what he's saying.  Anyway, so Suge Knight was shot.  And where are the white women at?  Where are the white people at?  At the DMAs.  And can someone please explain to me why Diddy is famous?  I really don't understand.  I don't get it. 
[01:03:00]  I don't understand why he's famous.  I like the new name, though.  Uh, yeah, Diddy.  It's catchy.  I like how Opie picked right up on that.  Thank you.  It's not Puff Daddy.  It's not Puffy.  It's not P. Diddy.  Thank you.  It's not Diddy.  I'm still calling him Sean.  I'm so far back.  I'm just calling him.  I know.  Stop it.  Why do you?  He tasks me.  They're thinking it.  You say it.  Let's say hi to Woody in St. Louis.  Woody.  Backing up a little bit.  Woody's going to help us out with an answer. 
[01:03:30]  All right, Woody.  Hey, boys.  Spanish hip-hop?  I think the name you might be groping for is Spick Hop.  Punch it out.  It's not.  Matt in Jersey.  Matt, do you have the answer to that?  Yes, I do, Opie.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  It's called reggaeton.  It's Spanish hip-hop and reggaet mixed together.  That's right.  That's one of the hottest.  Reggaeton.  That's one of the hottest music formats in the country as far as radio programming goes.  Really?  Yeah, but it's going to be a dying dinosaur pretty soon.  I mean, it's already a dinosaur now.  It's dying now.  All right.  Thank God. 
[01:04:00]  I'm a DJ.  I know what I'm talking about.  Thank you, Matt.  It's called the yak format.  Yak?  And reggaeton is alive and well on XM90.  Oh, really?  XM90.  To get a sample of what we're talking about, go to XM90.  Allegria or something like that.  I don't know.  That took six years of Spanish.  I have no fucking clue.  Six years of Spanish?  Six years of Spanish, and I can barely say my name in Spanish.  Barely say potato.  Oh, that's awful.  It's absolutely awful. 
[01:04:30]  All right.  Let's hit the phones here.  Yeah, so Diddy was the host of the VMAs, and I don't know.  I don't get it anymore.  It was a lot of rapping going on.  Yeah.  They don't really need white people music.  Well, I saw three white performances that would be considered rock.  Green Day, they gave them a great spot.  They opened up the VMAs, right?  Green Day's really good.  And then they had The Killers. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  They weren't even invited into the venue.  They had to perform in a hotel somewhere else in Miami.  Really?  They had to go to a hotel for their performance.  Because I think the people in the audience wouldn't appreciate The Killers.  No.  Is what I'm starting to think.  And then later on, way later on, they had Coldplay.  Coldplay is one of the biggest bands in the world, and they threw them way late in the broadcast.  Huh.  And I think that was it as far as rock goes, right?  And then it was just rap, rap, rap, right?  Just rap all over the place, yeah. 
[01:05:30]  What happened to the big...  Didn't they used to bring, like, Schwarzenegger would come out?  Mel Gibson would come out.  Like, there would be big stars that would come out on stage.  Big surprise at the end.  There's always something huge.  Well, last night's big surprise was MC Hammer.  Oh, well, okay.  MC Hammer came out.  Hammer time.  Did he do...  Did he do his dance?  Yeah.  Was he wearing his pants?  No.  Oh, can't do the dance without the pants.  They were announcing that it was a huge surprise, and then he performed for maybe 45 seconds. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  And that was it, and everyone's like, whoa, wow, what a...  Oh, who saw that coming?  Yeah.  It was awful.  God damn.  Here's Hilary Duff and Joel Madden with their awful intro to The Killers.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I messed up.  That was me that time.  Oh.  That was great.  Now, my boyfriend Joel here has introduced me to a lot of music that I had never listened 
[01:06:30]  to before that I absolutely love, like Morrissey, Brancid, AFI, The Murderers.  Um, I always get that wrong.  It's okay.  What?  Hey, live from Hotel Victor in Miami, it's The Killers.  The Murderers.  Oh.  I get...  Murderers, Killers.  Oh, boy.  Was that supposed to be a joke?  Yeah, of course.  It was...  You supposedly have these talented celebrities and you still are making them read off tele-props. 
[01:07:00]  Those tele-prop...  Ters.  Tele-props.  Yeah.  It's been a tele-prop for about nine years now.  Yeah, there's small planes that fly by with...  Tele-prop.  I like the tele-turbo-prop.  Well, they have them read that stuff that is right in front of them.  Tele-prompter.  Prompters.  And they're never funny jokes and they're never natural.  Well, it's, do you think that we could do that?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:07:30]  Cricket.  And then Cricket, Cricket.  And now the award for...  It's...  It's...  It's really, really...  That format is dead good.  They fucking clumsily lean into the microphone and then I was coming down.  Yeah, but it looks like you forgot your shoes.  Cricket, Cricket.  And now the award.  Cricket, I used to star in What's Happening.  Yeah.  Where are your legs? 
[01:08:00]  One of these award shows has...  They have to just get balls.  Yeah.  You got these talented people supposedly, even though we all know they're really not.  And you get them out on stage and just let them, you know, riff for like 30 seconds.  Come up with something on their own.  Instead of the crap they write for them.  They're supposed to be talented.  I played the father on a popular sitcom in the late 60s, early 70s.  Oh, yeah?  Don't breathe on me.  The joke would have the other person talking into the top of his head thinking he was the mic stand. 
[01:08:30]  Boy, this is fancy putting a robe out of my stand.  Of course.  The robe has to make it secure.  Let's see how to...  Sean in Jersey.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas? 
[01:09:00]  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yeah, it's pretty official, I think, that Rock is dead.  Yeah.  And what the hell?  I mean, is it really that broad base where there's that many people as a general appeal listening to this stuff?  I mean, I don't know anybody.  But then, again, I don't hang in really with Shuggy, so punch it out.  I'll tell you one thing, dude.  One of the reasons is Rock did it to itself by turning into a bunch of preachy faggots, whereas rap is, dude, look, I'm not a big rap fan, but they're still, like, you know, they're still hardcore, whereas rock has turned into a bunch of politically correct, they're all about causes, and nobody is just, like, fucking kicking ass anymore, except for a few bands, so people are kind of tired of it. 
[01:09:30]  How do you expect to attract people that are trying to rebel if you're just fucking being goody-two-shoes?  Right.  God, you make a great point.  You really do.  And the rap artists are, they still got their street cred.  They're just out there, you know, rocking, hip-hopping.  It seemed like it was a great year in music, and it just wasn't represented at the VMAs last night.  Represent.  It was all about the rapping. 
[01:10:00]  All about the rapping last night.  The only band that really, Green Day, that's about it.  Green Day had a great year.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Rich in New Jersey.  Rich, what's up?  Yo, boys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hi, buddy.  Hi.  Hey.  Yo, I wanted to comment about R. Kelly going up on stage and doing that whole acting thing.  Man, I've seen better acting when he was pissing on the 13-year-old.  Punching out.  All right.  Was she really 13?  How is this guy? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, I know.  How is he still?  There's a video.  Fat Nick is still in jail, and there's a video of R. Kelly tinkling on somebody.  If she's 18, that's fine, but how old is this chick?  I believe she was a youngster, yeah.  How is...  How does that happen?  I have no idea how this guy is still accepted amongst his peers.  Well, MTV, which, you know, it's amazing, but it's like, how do they allow this guy on?  I know.  Yeah.  Well, we have, uh...  Wow.  Fitty, fitty, fitty cent. 
[01:11:00]  A little altercation with Fat Joe.  Well, we got...  And fitty.  What is Fat Joe thinking?  Yeah.  He's had taken nine bullets.  Why would you fucking tangle with him?  I just want to play this 50 cent, uh, clip really fast for you.  Right?  Of course, you guys are hitting the stage today.  Um, are you...  What song are you performing?  Are you excited?  How did the rehearsals go?  We're going to do a melody, you know, so we'll do a little bit of...  I don't even want to tell him.  You know, you got to stay and watch the show.  What?  He meant to say, uh, medley.  Did he?  Oh, did he? 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, well, the long-term clip.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, he, uh, meant to say...  Medley, but he said that they're going to do a melody.  We're going to do a melody.  Voila.  And what's the, uh, what's the fight he had with Fat Joe?  What's the...  There was some kind of altercation between him and Fat Joe.  Yeah.  And then a couple of people from each of their entourage got into a little scuffle backstage.  So, when Fitty came out on stage, there were a bunch of cops that were brought out, uh,  around the stage to, um, keep any problems from happening. 
[01:12:00]  And he was talking about, uh, Artie Fuqua saw it, like, he caught at the cellar.  I don't know if any curses he got through, but he said that he kept yelling, you know,  fuck all you, you're all pussies, fuck everybody here.  Yeah, no.  Fuck all y'all.  Uh, one fuck got on the air, we got it here.  Really?  But here's, uh, 50 Cent, uh, cursing on MTV, uh, last night.  Well, this is the first clip.  Fat Joe, this is G-Unit?  What's that about?  That's 50 Cent's crew.  I don't know what their problem is with each other, but why would you, why would you do that? 
[01:12:30]  Hit the button, Ope.  I did.  Opey!  Oops.  The equipment's not back from there.  Cindy, hit the button.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  Ever since you went to that ranch in Crawford.  I like to tell the people home, I feel so safe tonight, with all this police protection  courtesy of G-Unit.  And the winner is Missy Elliott.  I saw them say that.  Is that a diss?  Was that Fat Joe?  Uh, well, Fat Joe's on stage, and then he's pointing out, look, you know. 
[01:13:00]  All the cops?  Well, look at all the cops protecting, uh, G-Unit and 50 and all that.  Yeah.  Oh, or Fiddy.  Oh, see, I miss, this is how dumb and white I am.  Uh, I thought that he was just saying that there are, there are a lot of people protecting  everybody from them.  Oh.  I don't know, I still don't know what has happened.  Let's listen again.  I like to tell the people home, I feel so safe tonight, with all this police protection  courtesy of G-Unit.  And the winner is, Missy Elliott. 
[01:13:30]  But what is he getting at?  He's basically saying G-Unit isn't that brave, he has to have all this police around to protect.  Oh, right.  Or the G-Unit crew, or what?  Yeah, right.  Huh?  Anyway, that's what he's saying, yeah.  Right, right.  You need all this, uh, police, uh, protection.  Pussy.  But, uh, they act so tough and stuff, but you need the police around to kind of protect them.  And then you got, uh, Mr. 50 here.  Fat Joe is...  Hey, man.  Pussy, boy. 
[01:14:00]  Fuck, boy.  Fuck.  What?  No, I think it's just...  Pussy.  With Bow Wow, Jamie Foss.  Oh, boy.  This is an award show?  Yeah.  Or a backyard barbecue in Brooklyn?  I don't fault the rappers, that's what rappers do.  They talk shit, and there's a problem.  Now there's a problem.  But they don't just talk shit, they shoot each other.  Oh, yeah, I mean, that's, they're not doing anything different.  I mean, 50 Cent was a fucking drug dealer, man.  The guy's been shot.  Why would you, why would you do that? 
[01:14:30]  So, basically, now we got the deal.  So, Fat Joe disses G-Unit, that was the first clip, and then 50 Cent responds and was cursing like crazy.  That was the actual audio from last night.  They were trying to dump out as much as possible, and then they actually just blew him off.  Back to the announcer.  I tell you, when I sat next to 50 on that plane, I didn't get that sense from him.  He was a very soft-spoken, nice guy.  How does he go through that metal detector?  He must have set that thing off, huh?  I only saw him.  He's got some lead in him.  When 50 and I chatted, it was on the aircraft, so I really didn't see. 
[01:15:00]  The bodyguards were in coach.  There's a lot of bodyguards will do.  And I think the G-Unit manager.  He touches his arm and goes, 50?  I might as well have, as much as I irritated him.  Well, here's 50.  I really am awful.  Here's 50 Cent responding again.  That's it.  Hey, man.  Pussy boy.  Fuck boy.  Fuck.  Wow.  I'm done.  I don't think it's a suit.  Pussy. 
[01:15:30]  Welcome with Bow Wow.  Wow.  It's funny.  All these white kids are cheering and clapping, and they have no idea that he really is threatening  to shoot somebody.  Oh, yeah.  Someone's going to die.  Yeah.  Someone's getting shot.  I believe this award show was just hijacked last night.  Yeah, by the Source Awards.  Hand it over.  Complete with shootings the night before.  Right.  They're just like, hey, here's three hours on MTV.  Have fun.  The Source Awards.  We're not getting in your way.  Hey, keep immersing yourself in that culture, MTV.  Keep thinking that you can keep it all under control. 
[01:16:00]  Keep putting yourself in that situation, and that's what you're going to get.  You know what gets me is their holier-than-thou attitude about, you know, they bleep out words  about pot on the videos.  They don't allow certain people on if they have a certain political stance that doesn't  suit them.  Yeah, absolutely.  Blur out t-shirts that might have a little...  Yeah, pot leaf on it or...  Or some kind of crazy saying, you know.  Yet, they just open their doors and just start kissing ass on murderers. 
[01:16:30]  This is the same company that booted you guys, by the way.  Yeah.  Same company, Viacom.  Exactly.  And meanwhile, there's basically a threat, a real threat between these two going on on  stage, and they put it all under the same roof, and they wonder why there's problems.  Yeah.  Well, that's why we're not doing any award presentations, Opie.  I knew that was going to happen.  Because of our background.  Yet, they just let these guys go up there all the time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys can't do an award presentation on Spike, whatever it is, because, you know, you 
[01:17:00]  did something naughty.  And meanwhile, these guys are in a culture of shooting each other, and all they do is  talk about drugs, and women are whores, which is fine with me, but be consistent in your  morality.  Once again, not consistent.  I haven't talked about this on the air yet?  No, we haven't brought it up.  Oh, okay.  Well, FHM invited me and Ant, but Ant was doing something, to a meeting at the Viacom building,  our old company, because they're going to have the video game awards on Spike, I guess. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And FHM's going to be one of the big sponsors, or they were pitching to be one of the big  sponsors.  So I was in a boardroom, and all the bigwigs from Spike TV come walking in.  Did they have the bigwigs?  Were they actually bigwigs?  The bigwig.  And I'm sitting there going, why am I even here?  Yeah.  But XM's like, no, this will help FHM and stuff.  And I'm thinking in my head, there's no way this is going to help.  It actually will hurt.  Right when I read it, it's like, yeah, working on getting you guys to present an award. 
[01:18:00]  Supposedly the deal was, yeah, we would present an award at the Video Game Awards.  At the Video Game Awards on Spike, which is cool.  You know, I love video games.  That'd be awesome.  I know everything about them.  I love them.  And it would be good.  Relevant for us, the show.  It would be a perfect fit, actually.  Yeah, it's not like us presenting at a fashion award or something like that.  And your audience is huge, huge in video games.  Yeah.  Plus the fact we would talk about the awards a lot.  Of course.  Do it afterward, what happened while we were there, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, it could be fun.  So I'm sitting in this conference room, and now they come in, and now everyone is doing 
[01:18:30]  the meet and greet, like, hi, I'm blah, blah, and I'm blah, blah, blah.  This is blah, blah.  I'm in programming here at Spike.  And the guy that runs the channel, so he's going around the room, they get to me, and  the guy looked at me like he saw a ghost, like, holy crap, this person is supposed to be banned  from this building.  Why is he even in this Viacom building?  Why is he even here?  But he was being polite.  He barely looked at me, barely said hi, sat down, and the whole time I'm like, oh my God, 
[01:19:00]  why am I here?  And he wouldn't let you in the secret room.  Why am I here?  And then at the end, of course, this is what told it all.  Everyone's leaving after FHM.  FHM had an amazing presentation, by the way.  Ben, you were there.  An amazing presentation.  Ben was there in my stead.  Best presentation I've ever seen.  An amazing presentation.  Really good.  And then it was time to leave, and all the guys from Spike TV left without even saying  goodbye, which obviously...  How about this? 
[01:19:30]  I obviously knew that was going to happen.  Fuck Spike TV.  It stinks.  Fuck you.  You stink.  I love Jimmy.  I hate Spike TV, you fucking faggots.  Trying to get guys to watch.  Jerk offs.  Three years later, we're still being blackballed, is what I want to say here.  Dog shit faggot channel.  That UFC stuff is pretty good on there, though.  Of course, the people we went there with from XM, they're like, oh, I think the meeting  went really well.  And I'm like, I didn't want to bust anyone's bubble. 
[01:20:00]  I'm like, yeah, it was cool.  What did I do?  I called Anthony immediately, and I said, dude.  We just know.  Dude, and I told him what happened, and he's like, yeah.  And sure enough, the email came down, I think, last week that they have passed on using us.  Of course they did.  Well, who runs Spike TV?  Gee, I'd love to know who the president of that is, who's running Spike TV.  I bet you he runs another network that does comedy on that same company.  Honestly, I don't know.  The guy I met who was supposedly the big, big guy at Spike, he looked at me like, ugh. 
[01:20:30]  What do you expect?  What do you expect, dude?  They fucking blow.  You know, persona non grata, Opie.  Yeah, well, maybe if you were convicted of shooting somebody, or if you fucking dealt drugs,  you'd be welcome back on the network.  Maybe that.  Fucking musicians get away with everything.  All right, let's say hi.  And yes, Brian, I was going to wear my wizard robe and pointy hat on the video game award,  which would have just been a big hit.  Opie and Dopey.  My wand. 
[01:21:00]  A big faggot.  Tapping, tapping Opie's head.  You speak now.  Yes.  Like Glenda.  I can picture you like the good witch.  Yes.  At least they were nice enough to let me sit in the meeting.  That was nice.  Instead of having me escort out of the building.  You should never go to one of those again.  Which has happened in the past, by the way.  Let's say hi to Tony in Jersey.  Tony, what's up?  Tony.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  All right.  I just wanted to call Bob Dane Cook.  I saw his set last night.  I'm a pretty big Dane Cook fan, but boy, did he shit the bed last night. 
[01:21:30]  It was pretty awful.  Really?  Well, it wasn't his crowd.  You got to defend Dane a little bit.  You know, he got great exposure last night.  White girls.  They gave him a couple minutes on the VMAs, and yeah, it didn't go too well, huh?  Dane gets hot white chicks at his gigs.  I got a little glimpse of...  You understand, my fan base physically rapes his fan base.  Exactly.  No offense to the pests.  I would dump you fuckers in a minute for Dane Cook's fan base. 
[01:22:00]  The fucking hottest chicks are the fucking hottest chicks.  It makes me sick.  Yeah.  And every one of them wants to bang them.  Yeah.  I didn't see his set, actually.  Welcome back, boys.  I'll talk to you.  All right.  I didn't either.  Well, we got some audio of Dane Cook last night at the VMAs.  Let's see how it went down.  A lot of people think that OGs don't like to laugh, but that ain't true.  Take my word, this next guy.  What's an OG?  All right.  Is that Snoop?  Yeah.  By the way, Snoop, this guy has lost every bit of street cred.  When he's calling Lee Iacocca Iacizl on those commercials and playing golf. 
[01:22:30]  He's playing golf with Lee Iacocca?  Yeah, it's about the deals.  What the fuck?  What kind of street cred does he have anymore?  I don't mind him, but once again, another example of how if you're a rapper or a musician,  your past is irrelevant.  And that's fine.  Maybe it should be.  Cool.  Okay.  You're a musician now.  Good.  But you guys, they ban you for life from that fucking company.  And Spike, you know what, dude?  Who cares?  It stinks. 
[01:23:00]  That's right.  Oh, I don't.  Fucking cornball network.  You're fucking cornballs.  Jimmy, I didn't go to the meeting.  I know.  I didn't go to the meeting hoping that someone's going to accept me.  You know, I didn't care.  I was just being a good, like, you know, XM company guy.  I talked to you afterwards.  I didn't even do that shit.  I'm like, good soldier.  Yeah, I was being a good soldier.  I mean, you know, everyone knows we're rebuilding our careers here.  We're trying to make the biggest comeback in radio history.  Yeah, no worries.  So, you know, we're trying to go along with some of these ideas these guys got.  But I knew the whole time that we were going to be dissed and the black ball would continue. 
[01:23:30]  Well, you just said to me, I said on the air, you said to me after, like, after the meeting  I talked to you that day, and you're like, dude, it's going, no, we're not going to do  it.  You said the guy wanted no part of it.  And I, Danny, thank you for bringing this note, but I did know Doug Herzog, president  of Spike TV and also of Comedy Central.  That's, I knew the answer to that.  It was kind of a sarcastic thing.  But what, you know, come on, please.  Is that a surprise?  If you're an alternative guy, I'm sure you don't.  Yeah, but I want to make it perfectly clear.  I wasn't, I didn't go there hoping, like, oh, I'm going to finally be accepted, whatever.  No. 
[01:24:00]  You know?  I just kind of knew it.  I did it for XM.  Fucking hate them.  Did you ever watch that Ultimate Fighting Championship stuff on Spike?  That's, uh...  I can't get enough of it now.  I got the pay-per-view over the weekend.  You can see that shit?  Oh, dude, it's the best.  Chuck Liddell is the champ now, and he is an animal.  Animal.  I had a problem with him once.  You did?  Yeah.  Seriously?  Yeah.  You're joking now.  He heckled me one time, and I sucked his dick. 
[01:24:30]  I'm looking, going, and there is no way you have a problem with him.  Jimmy, isn't really a problem?  And speak without drool coming out of your mouth.  The guy is an animal.  You remember Tito Ortiz?  Yeah, of course.  He took out Steve in, what, 10 seconds or something?  In 10 seconds, he took out Steve C.  Just, like, made him his bitch.  All 5'8 of them?  Yeah.  That fucking nut-tall homo Steve is?  He was, you know, big, but he just laid Steve out. 
[01:25:00]  Done.  And Chuck Liddell just knocked him out.  Knocked Tito Ortiz out.  And he defended his championship last week, and I got the pay-per-view last night in just  this guy's...  Just an animal.  You can't imagine squaring off with this guy.  And there's no big boxing gloves or any of that.  No rules.  They knock guys down on the ground, and then with their elbow, just start pounding them  across the face.  It is fan-fucking-tastic. 
[01:25:30]  We watched last night.  One guy in one of these matches got hit in his big cauliflower ear.  It made the sound of a cherry tomato smashing and snapping open, and blood gushed out of  his head.  Fantastic.  See, I always wonder where my line is.  Yeah.  And it's right there.  That's it.  I can't watch that stuff.  I love it.  I cannot watch it.  Especially when they got him in that position where they can't defend themselves anymore,  like you're saying.  Yeah.  And then just keep going to town.  And they tap out, and the ref's got to jump in because the guy's so pumped up. 
[01:26:00]  He's just bludgeoning the guy's face with his elbow.  Yeah.  And knees.  Like, a guy will duck down to try to get away from a punch, and the guy will just knee  him in the face, laid out.  It's fantastic.  All right.  Well, here's Dane Cook with Snoop Dogg.  That's where we were at, right?  Snoop.  Snoop.  Yeah.  Anyway.  A lot of people think that OGs don't like to laugh, but that ain't true.  Take my word.  This next guy is funny.  Straight up and down.  His new album is blazing up the charts, and believe me, nephew, 
[01:26:30]  he knows the secret of what telling a joke is all about.  Timing.  So make a little noise for my boy, Dane Cook.  Dane Cook.  Snoop Dogg has never heard Dane Cook before.  Dane Cook.  In his life.  Isn't that a coincidence?  He's the only white guy there, and his name is Cook.  It's a huge spot for Dane, though.  Come on. 
[01:27:00]  What's up?  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes.  You've been a great crowd.  Everybody's good.  You've been patient.  You're enthusiastic.  And I want to tell you a little bit about a game I invented that we're going to play at  the end of the night if you can continue this behavior.  This is what we're going to do.  In a few minutes, we're going to turn off all the lights in this entire room.  This game I invented.  It's called Who's in My Mouth?  And it's a blasty blast.  Could be Snoop.  Could be, you never know.  Could be a celeb. 
[01:27:30]  I was checking out the news, and I saw this.  This was kind of wild.  Now, when you have a newborn baby, right?  And I have to do it like this, because I don't have time to pantomime an entire baby birth  right now.  So, you have a newborn baby.  They can take your baby.  They can put a microchip inside your baby.  And if somebody kidnaps your kid, you can do a Google search.  And find your kid via satellite, right?  Where's James?  James?  Honey, where's your...  Get online now. 
[01:28:00]  Get online.  And it takes you to, like, MapQuest, and there's a beacon of James on the 305.  James is...  James is stolen.  I hate this idea.  I don't like it.  I'll tell you right now.  I don't like it, because sometimes technology fails us.  This is what I want to do.  I want to upgrade the entire scenario, right?  Right next to the microchip.  You know what I want to do?  I want to put a detonator.  Yeah.  Because if I can't have my kid, neither can you.  Blow your kid up.  I swear to God, this will work. 
[01:28:30]  We laugh, because we like a little violence.  We like a little violence in this country.  And I know you're like me.  You can't deny it.  Sometimes when you see somebody walking down the street wearing a Superman t-shirt, you  just want to shoot them in the chest.  And when they start to bleed, go, I guess not.  Don't wear that shirt.  Wear a shirt that says, I bleed if you shoot me in the chest, citizen.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm Dan Cook.  Let's give it away an award right now.  Shoot.  Why are you covering your face? 
[01:29:00]  That's a rough spot for a comic, man.  Chappelle went on last year, and it's a weird reaction.  It's not a comedy crowd, man.  No.  They're all a little too cool for the room to laugh at anything.  Yeah, but they're too young.  They're dumb.  I mean, they're not...  Yeah, they get it.  Yeah, whatever, man.  And they're just...  They want music.  It's like comedy and music very rarely mix. 
[01:29:30]  Why is Lars doing storm coverage for Fox News?  He just really doesn't...  Look at Lars.  I know it's a visual.  Oh, he's got his goggles, Paisano goggles on.  He's wearing goggles.  It's a Category 4 hurricane at this moment in time.  It has made landfall, and we are eagerly awaiting the destruction of New Orleans, which won't  happen, because they're all full of shit.  All right.  All right.  Wind's now near 145 miles an hour, so... 
[01:30:00]  Face first into the wind like a douche.  They're dipping down.  Just take one of these guys out on live TV, please.  Please.  A branch.  Please.  A 2x4.  Something that could hit him in the head.  Just wail his head against that brick wall.  I'm trying to stand, yet we get it.  It's windy.  You're going to be on the coast of Mississippi.  You know, you're a dead man.  You've got to get out of there.  So, I don't think they were hiding it. 
[01:30:30]  I'll catch back to you in a couple of minutes, if you could...  I don't even know where he's going to go.  He said the buildings are locked in his hotel.  The closer the building, the less wind resistance.  All right, Steve, come on back toward the camera where it's not quite as windy.  He's out in the wind to demonstrate how breezy it actually is.  He's talking about the loss of life, and I'm looking on the Times-Picayune website,  which is the big newspaper for New Orleans,  and there's a blog, and there are people who live all over the country who are writing. 
[01:31:00]  There's a gym in Michigan who is terrified that his mother, who lives in New Orleans,  she told him, I'm not leaving, son.  I've ridden these out before.  He is terrified for his mother.  There are some other people as well.  People are worried about their loved ones.  Because you don't have contact.  And Mississippi Emergency Management, by the way, they're...  All right.  I'll tell you one thing.  I'm really impressed with this.  I've got to take back what I said about Spike TV.  There's some really impressive programming on this network.  I was completely incorrect.  There's some good stuff.  I know you like the Ultimate Fighting stuff. 
[01:31:30]  Ah.  But they also have Maximum MLB.  They have Star Trek TNG CSI.  The next generation, yeah.  That's really good stuff, man.  Extreme 4x4.  Trucks!  Exclamation point.  Star Trek DS9.  Car and Driver.  DS9, yes.  This must be great.  Spike's Most Amazing Videos.  Horsepower TV.  I've got to tell you, this is really interesting stuff. 
[01:32:00]  White Trash Television.  Well, you know what it is?  It's for guys.  Guys will like this stuff.  Guys like to watch trucks.  I knew this would just stop, Jimmy.  I can't tell you.  We brought it to the program.  We knew going into it.  It makes me want to throw.  I want to bite somebody's fucking face.  Yeah.  It is really annoying.  Because you know what's behind it. 
[01:32:30]  It was just like.  I love just like.  We talk about it a lot on the show.  The dishonesty of the whole thing.  The guy obviously hated me to my face.  And didn't have the balls to say anything.  Like, what are you doing here?  I don't want him to do this meeting if you're here.  Blah, blah, blah.  It was all done behind the scenes after the fact.  Worse it was.  More cowards.  But again, maybe it went above Spike TV.  I'm shitting on Spike TV.  But maybe they were like.  All right, we'll see what happens.  And maybe Viacom just said no.  I mean, who knows?  Sometimes it goes over their heads.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  What's going on, guys? 
[01:33:00]  Welcome back.  Thanks, Rob.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Well, thank you, buddy.  No problem.  Yeah.  You guys always say that satellite radio has ruined you guys.  Now, this is a little off the subject.  I was thinking just for like one day.  You guys should try doing a show like it was back on commercial radio.  See if you guys can watch the language and do it like it was back at N.E.W., you know?  I was just always curious to see if you guys could pull it off.  Who is this, Ron Valeri?  Satellite radio has ruined them, you know?  Dude, satellite radio is the greatest thing ever.  Commercial radio is castrating and awful. 
[01:33:30]  Yep.  It's never fun when you have to work around things.  I hate when people go, oh, you know, it's part of the fun.  No, it wasn't.  It was a necessary evil.  It was a chore at times.  I know.  You guys are so like relaxed now that I would just love to see you guys just try to pull  it off again.  I know you guys could do it, but I would just...  Go listen to our old tapes on OAVirus.com.  Right.  We did 10 years of that crap.  Go listen to the old show.  And half of that stuff couldn't be done anymore.  That's all right.  See ya.  Let's try to do a clean show. 
[01:34:00]  Go fuck yourself.  This is the future.  All right, we'll go to break with Green Day, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, just in case  you missed it from last night's VMAs.  Spike TV is for guys.  It was the video of the year, Anthony.  Hey, guys, come on.  Spike's on.  Yeah.  Hey, yeah.  Bunch of guys.  Hey, dude.  It drives me nuts to this day, because we really didn't do much wrong that day. 
[01:34:30]  We listened to the old tapes recently, and I got so many phone calls and emails from  people going, that's what you guys got fired for?  I'm like, yeah, exactly.  And they're still holding it against us to this day.  If that company had one ounce of just...  If they were just consistent in the way they did things like that, it would be fine.  But they're not.  All right.  Let's check out some Green Day as we go to break.  I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. 
[01:35:00]  You don't know where it goes, but it's on the man I walk aboard.  I walk this empty street on the floor, the board of broken dreams. 
[01:35:30]  When the city sleeps, and I'm the only one, and I walk alone.  I walk around.  I walk alone.  I walk alone.  I walk alone.  When I walk up, my shadow's on the window, what's inside me?  My shadow's on the watch, don't they ask me?  When I'm trying to wish someone to help me, you better find what's inside me. 
[01:36:00]  I'm walking down the line, that invites me somewhere if I'm right.  On the borderline of the edge of where I walk alone. 
[01:36:30]  Miami!  It beats where the lines are, what's up and everything's all right.  Check my vital signs, and now I'm still alive, and I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk up. 
[01:37:00]  My shadow's on the one that walks inside me.  My shadow's on the watch, don't care what's inside me.  Sometimes I wish someone to help me, you better find me.  Believe that I'm not alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone. 
[01:37:30]  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk alone.  I walk alone, I walk alone.  I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams 
[01:38:00]  When the saint sleeps and I'm the only one  I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams 
[01:38:30]  When I walk this empty street on the boulevard of broken dreams  We'll be right back. 
[01:39:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:39:30]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We'll be right back. 
[01:40:00]  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're talking about Hurricane Katrina today.  Hurricane Katrina.  You know, it started as a tropical depression over the Bahamas where I was on vacation.  And it amounted to one really kind of rainy, windy day. 
[01:40:30]  And I get an email from Eric.  I heard you were in Atlantis.  I heard that place got decimated.  Are you home yet?  What the hell news did you hear that...  That's what they were saying on the news in Florida.  Down in West Palm.  They were saying it was right over the Atlantis and that all got hit and everything.  I'm like, oh great, he's there.  It was raining.  Let me tell you where I was during the peak of my experience with this hurricane.  I was in the pool as it was raining. 
[01:41:00]  It was just...  It was like some drizzle.  It's still 95 degrees.  It was fantastic.  Did you do the lazy river?  No, I didn't do the lazy river.  There was more damage done by Hurricane Casino, which did thousands of dollars of damage to my wallet.  Really?  Took a hit?  Oh, I took kind of a hit.  Took a couple of G's.  Couple of G's.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:41:30]  It was awful.  I was doing good and then I was doing horrid.  Three card or...  Three card.  Three card.  I was doing really good.  And then, you know, took a shit.  Mm-hmm.  Happens.  So you're saying that stupid got all the facts wrong and called you a panic chicken?  Completely sent me this panicky email.  Thought I was in the heat of it.  There's nothing.  It was...  It would rain for a day.  But the rest of the time down there, god damn, that place is great.  Atlantis is nice.  Oh, it's awesome.  I never know.  It was so fucking hot. 
[01:42:00]  You go to the beach and you couldn't stay out of the water for any period of time.  You would burn up.  How long was the flight?  Direct flight from JFK down there on JetBlue.  Took about two and a half hours.  That's it?  Yeah.  No dealing with Miami, that fucking airport in Miami.  Nothing.  Direct flight.  Off the plane.  You're at the hotel.  You're at the beach.  A few hours later.  Long ride to Atlantis, though.  Oh, you get the taxi ride with the guy.  Holy crap.  They're on the wrong side of the road. 
[01:42:30]  The steering wheel's on the other side of the car.  You're shitting your pants.  The locals are out.  Oh, boy.  You're just praying you can get to the compound.  The savages.  Oh, my God.  The savages are out, man.  We have talked about that.  Well, please, taxi, don't break down.  The ride from the airport to the compound is always an experience, no matter what tropical  island you go to.  Holy crap.  You're just seeing the sights.  It's just an island of poverty with these little oasis of hotels, luxury hotels, that 
[01:43:00]  you just do not leave.  You don't leave the compound.  And with a taxi ride to and from the airport, you have to leave the compound.  That's an adventure.  So you're looking around, and sometimes they take little shortcuts through the neighborhoods,  and you're just looking at the houses, and oh, please, please, car, keep going.  Can't you get a driver or something, like a car service?  Oh, what?  Like a limo?  Something, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that would probably attract attention.  It's really not much down there.  I don't think you want to be driving a limo through some of these neighborhoods. 
[01:43:30]  No, you just drive one of those vans.  They got those taxi vans.  Yeah.  You get there, though.  Everything's pretty cool.  How far from the airport was the hotel?  Yeah, it was about a half-hour drive.  Yeah.  It's a ways.  It's a little bit of a ways, but once you get there.  I don't think Atlantis is for Jimmy, though.  Why?  A lot of families.  I like, I wouldn't mind that with a, maybe a gal that I met this week?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah?  Oh?  Well, I don't think she knows I like her, but...  Serious, Sergeant? 
[01:44:00]  No, no, I just met her.  I'd like to meet her.  Bring her by my house.  I actually met her on a train.  She took a picture of me.  I think she liked me.  She snapped the picture.  Yeah.  I couldn't tell.  Her expressionless face.  That's why she was taking her picture.  She was staring at her with her stupid eyes.  Jimmy, did you really meet a young lady this past week?  Well, let's just say, yeah, but we didn't do anything.  We just sit alone.  But that's good.  Could be the start of something.  Is it that, do you see this going anywhere? 
[01:44:30]  No idea if she even likes me.  I got kind of vibes, but then I didn't.  I'm homely.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, we should invite Drew Curtis from FARC into the studio.  FARC!  From F-A-R-C dot com, FARC dot com.  Yes.  Let's get them all set up.  What else happened during break?  I'm asking that to the listeners.  What do you want us to talk about?  Please give us a call.  I know there were a bunch of assaults on the media over the break.  Yep.  We have one of the guys that did one of them, Boston Strangler from Whackbag dot com. 
[01:45:00]  Boston Strangler.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hey, man.  You know, I'm just getting back into the swing of things here, Boston Strangler.  I still haven't seen your assault on the media.  Well, it wasn't necessarily an assault on the media.  It was more an assault on Baba Booey from Howard.  Oh, what happened?  Oh, yeah.  Basically, a bunch of us from Whackbag, myself, Surly Trucker, Bunny, Sonny Ferrelli, Drackle, Danny 75, Schnauzer, and Yellow Disclin, along with Premarital, we decided to converge on Government Center last Friday because Baba Booey had a signing at Newberry Comics. 
[01:45:30]  Fucking Howard.  Fucking Howard.  All right, I got to tell you, man, because this goes way back because we used to, you know, cross paths with Baba Booey here and there.  And Howard just doesn't pay the guy a lot of money, so he still has to do these dumb, awful appearances to try to make ends meet.  Way to take care of your people, Howard. 
[01:46:00]  He's at a record store doing a signing?  Yeah, basically what he was doing was a promotion gig for WBCN and for a hoo-hoo show.  Right.  So we brought in our secret weapon.  We went in and got Wheelchair Fred.  We got the draft, guys.  We got the draft going.  It's Doug Out Dog, too.  Hey, Doug Out, what's up?  What's up?  We got the draft going.  We drafted Fred.  Oh, okay.  Wheelchair Fred is part of the O&A Army now?  They'll take anybody.  Yep.  We picked up Fred, actually, with Surly Trucker who did. 
[01:46:30]  And our secret weapon with Fred was he had a dildo, and he was going to try to get it signed by Baba Booey.  The one he shoved up his ass?  Yeah.  So he'd have to touch it?  Yep.  So what happened was, I guess, Sonny Ferrelli wheeled Fred up to the door.  They weren't going to let Fred in at first.  And then pre-marital, the guy in the banana suit, started shouting, you know, they're not letting a guy in a wheelchair in. 
[01:47:00]  And starting getting the crowd all, you know, riled up and whatnot.  So eventually, Sonny Ferrelli smooth-talked his way in.  And to make a long story short, basically, we got Fred to, ugh, I stink.  No, no, no.  It's really good.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  Boston Strangler.  Come on. 
[01:47:30]  You got a group.  You got Fred to what?  Basically, we got Fred in there, and Baba Booey just signed something for Fred.  And we're going to send it into the studio this morning.  And you guys should have it tomorrow or the next week.  Well, did you guys say anything to him or no?  Well, what happened was, while Fred was in there with Sonny Ferrelli, myself, and a bunch of other pets,  standing by the window waving and shouting and screaming, handing out wow stickers and some other flyers,  saying, you know, the reason Howard sucks and everything else. 
[01:48:00]  Are you shook up?  Are you nervous?  Eject.  Eject.  Are you shook up?  Are you nervous?  Punching out, boy.  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Jimmy, let him go.  I want to know what happened when you pulled up, like, was there a crowd?  Let him go.  Let him go.  I appreciate the effort, Boston Strangler.  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you.  Basically, the best thing about this was it was a really good showing for activating one of our sleeper cells at short notice. 
[01:48:30]  We got about ten guys and a lady up there.  To go ahead and try to embarrass Baba Boo with a little bit of O&A advertising, it actually went very well.  The problem was the big thing was getting wheelchair Fred in there to try to have the disgusting...  You're in training, Anthony.  That's all.  This is one of these little training maneuvers.  That's all.  They're getting ready for the big fight, the big war.  This is dug out Doug, by the way.  Come on in for the big win. 
[01:49:00]  It was a really good showing.  What we did also was Boston Strangler made up some pamphlets, basically exposing some of the lies that Hulu's been telling over the past couple of weeks.  We had the facts about how many subscription numbers Sirius has and where they can find your own information to get the proof.  So we just wanted to jump in there and embarrass him while we could in person, which was a good time.  Quiet.  We had pictures with him.  We had a guy in a man's suit, which is all...  Stop it!  Stop it!  It's really time for you guys to rev up the army, by the way. 
[01:49:30]  It's time.  It is just time to just go balls out from this point on.  Sonny Forelli, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  What's up, Sonny?  I'll tell you something.  I had to go to the bathroom before I went in there, and I had to go to City Hall Plaza and go through the motions.  I go through the scanner there, and, you know, we're getting searched and everything, and I forgot that.  Searched?  I had a dozo in his back.  I forgot.  I forgot.  You did?  You forgot?  Where are you from?  I hear an accent.  Are you from Philly? 
[01:50:00]  No, I'm from Boston.  I'm Steve.  Meat tits.  I'm just kidding.  All right, Sonny.  Go ahead.  Yeah, so anyways, I'm wheeling Fred into the store, and they weren't going to let us in,  and I had to give up the bag.  They knew about the dildo.  By the way, hold on.  By the way, it says, Sonny Forelli, and then it says, I can tell the story better.  Right.  Sonny, you're failing miserably.  And why did you say to Angie to get on the ride, you fat pig? 
[01:50:30]  Why did you yell at your wife like that at that time in Coney Island?  And then rob a bank for your homosexual friend.  All right.  I think you guys cleared it up perfectly.  I guess there's something that went on in Boston while we were on vacation.  Thank you.  You're not dying, Sonny.  You're killing everyone around you.  I can't wait to see the rest of the whack bag people just bash them now.  They're going to lambast them at how horrid their appearance was today.  They do like to eat their own.  Oh, they do.  And, dude, we go up to the gas station, right?  And I tell him, no, things on the left, but he pulls up to the right. 
[01:51:00]  So we've got to back the car up, turn around.  The guy does, you know, and then there's cars in the way.  But here's the good part.  I go inside to get some chips.  Shut up.  They didn't have the ones that he wanted.  We don't care.  So Doug says to the banana guy.  Hey, Joe in Jersey, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  Joseph.  Well, why do you keep shitting on Howard Stern?  Because he's a dick.  He's a hypocrite.  He's a liar. 
[01:51:30]  He's not a dick.  He's not a hypocrite.  He steals everyone's bits and radio and then claims that he invented everything.  Joe, Joe, did you ever work at Infinity Broadcasting with Howard Stern?  Did you ever have Howard run to the boss and start whining?  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  And tell Mel Carmisen to have us fired because we talked about his fucking daughter.  Meanwhile, he can talk about whoever he wants without a problem, but he's too afraid to  confront it on the air.  So he goes to the boss.  He goes to Mel Carmisen. 
[01:52:00]  You're talking about fucking whining.  All you do is fucking whine.  Oh, that's exactly what we do on this show.  You're obviously listening very closely.  We do not.  We don't whine.  Stop it.  Joe.  Shut up, Joe.  You're listening to the show, aren't you?  Joe, you got to answer Anthony's point, though.  The show is based on what, you fucking phony?  I'm sorry.  What was that?  Joe, you should address Anthony's point, though.  Anthony did make a valid point.  Can you express that point again?  I'm sorry.  No, but seriously, listen to him.  It's actually a valid point, man. 
[01:52:30]  It's the fact that Howard would run to Mel Carmisen behind the scenes and undermine  everything we were trying to do to make our show popular at the time we were at WNEW.  Instead of being the honest, bad boy, do battle on the air kind of guy that he tries  to present himself as, he ran to management to have us quieted.  Pardon me?  Yeah?  Where do you base that honesty from?  Where, how the fuck do you, do you, is he honest? 
[01:53:00]  What?  It's a fucking personality.  It's a fucking goof.  It's a character.  It's a personality.  It's a character.  Yeah, and we're calling him out for being a dickbag by running to our boss to have us  fired.  If some asshole you worked with was constantly going to your boss and trying to get you fired,  wouldn't you think he was a dick, Joe?  Seriously.  Oh, yeah.  All right?  That's where we stand with Howard.  Yeah, but you're fucking, that's not the same thing.  Dude, the problem, Joe, the thing is this, when you're talking about freedom of speech 
[01:53:30]  and stuff like that, it's kind of hard to be very big on freedom of speech if you've  had a gag order put on somebody.  It's a very difficult, it's a big inconsistency, man.  You're talking about fighting a character.  You're talking about fucking fighting a movie character.  No, no, no.  See, his character on the air is one thing.  The way he was a dickbag in real life, with real life issues like our job and our bosses  and what we were allowed to talk about and not allowed to talk about, that's the real 
[01:54:00]  shit.  We're not talking about the character.  The character on the air, fine, fuck him, whatever he is.  I'm talking about the asshole we had to deal with on an almost daily fucking basis.  The guy that sat in his limo outside the Park Plaza and refused to go in for his own press  conference because we were in attendance.  Until we were thrown out.  That guy.  Yeah, shit like that, Joe.  Shit he doesn't talk about.  Oh, that didn't give you any fucking bits.  That didn't give you a fucking...  No, we weren't allowed to talk about any of these.  No, whenever we brought up Howard Stern.  What do you do right now?  What are you doing right now?  Now we can.  Now we're spending about 20 minutes talking about Howard Stern and then we'll move on 
[01:54:30]  with our show, douchebag.  We don't do this every day.  You know that.  You do do it every fucking day.  No, we don't, Joe.  Stop.  You're being dishonest with yourself.  You do it every day because douchebags like me calling and make you do it.  Joe, wouldn't you be frustrated, Joe, wouldn't you be frustrated, though, if you weren't  allowed to say what you wanted to say about it?  I mean, of course you wouldn't be.  There are some people that just don't really get it.  They kind of see Howard back in, you know, the late 80s, early 90s.  They're stuck in that whole mindset.  And the truth of the matter was, we talk about it because he was a dick in real life. 
[01:55:00]  Here's some audio from his show recently.  But genuine enemies of yours would be great.  That's what I'm going for.  None of that crap at the end, like, but I really love you.  And that's exactly what happened when I was talking to Don.  He said, well, immediately we need Rosie O'Donnell.  I mean, right away it comes out.  That's who would really be the roast.  Do you believe that Jay Leno would have the...  They're talking about roasting Howard as he leaves regular radio.  And they want to have people that hate him. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, there'll be all sorts of rules and stuff.  Of course.  It's just going to be just a kiss-ass session.  The ability to do it correctly.  Would Jay Leno come and really roast him?  Jay Leno used to be one of the greatest comedians ever.  I don't know if he's still got it in.  Nobody knows what Jay's got.  He can do it if he wants.  He's not a roasting kind of comic, though.  He doesn't have that go-for-the-jugular type thing.  But if he did, I think he'd be great.  But Letterman, if he would do it, he'd be fantastic.  I'd love to hear Letterman, Rose.  See, I think Letterman would do it.  Yeah, I think he'd be great. 
[01:56:00]  You know, five minutes, whatever he wants to do.  You know who else I'm thinking?  Who really hates me?  Pat Cooper.  Oh!  He hates my guts.  He's amazing at roast his first time.  And he'll kill me.  He will kill me.  Pat used to be a friend, right?  What?  Pat was a friend at one time?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was a real good friend, but he just went berserk on me.  He was like another dice.  But okay, crap.  Yeah, right.  Okay, but now...  Those are the guys.  You let them at me.  Let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  I know...  Ryan White's mom. 
[01:56:30]  Come on, let's go.  I know what direction Pat Cooper would take.  Let him go.  You sure?  Let him do it.  You know what I'm talking about?  Let him go.  Yeah.  That'd be tough.  He thinks I'm a censorship because Opie and Anthony...  No, no, no.  It's worse than that.  He starts attacking your family.  Right, right.  He thinks you're a bad father.  But let him do it.  Right.  Let him do it.  He thinks...  Right.  But that's a role.  Right.  He thinks I'm a bad...  But then I get to go up and wail on him as a parent?  You wouldn't recognize his son.  Yeah.  That's not a joke. 
[01:57:00]  Pat Cooper calling you a bad parent.  That's really...  But let's have everyone have their turn on me.  Ah.  He kind of addressed the Pat Cooper thing, but barely.  Yeah.  Pat Cooper decided to stop being Howard's friend after Pat found out that Howard was making  us shut up.  I'd love to know how Pat found that out.  I know I mentioned it to him when we did Tough Crowd.  Yeah.  But he might have known it before then.  I don't know.  But he was like, what?  What? 
[01:57:30]  Who is he?  He talks about free speech?  And then he shuts those guys down.  A yelling old borscht belt comic.  Why don't you bring him on?  I'd love to have Pat Cooper on.  We could have Pat Cooper on if he would do our show.  Talk about it.  But he found out that Howard was censoring us and he said, I can't be your friend anymore.  You're a phony.  That's exactly how it went down.  But why...  Just the thing is, the way that it was mentioned, like, you know what direction he's going 
[01:58:00]  to take.  Like, should I mention it?  Like, why wouldn't you just mention it?  Because it's been a taboo subject for years with him.  He...  We got under his skin so bad on commercial radio, he couldn't take it anymore.  All the things...  Yelling and screaming behind the scenes.  It would be one thing if he hadn't spent years and years and years calling other jocks  pussies for not confronting him on the air.  And, you know, he would go into these markets and destroy the jock that was in that market 
[01:58:30]  that was doing well because the other jock wouldn't respond to him.  They'd have these program directors that would say, no, just ignore him and it'll go away.  And the truth of the matter is, it wouldn't go away.  And the second we started hitting back and hitting back through a shared audience, a lot of our audience  were shared with his, he lost his mind, wouldn't address it on the air, and ran to Mel Karmazin,  which Mel Karmazin called us up into meetings in his office, not with an underling, with Mel Karmazin, the guy, 
[01:59:00]  and told us, you are not to talk about Howard Stern on your show or you and your boss will be fired.  That was told to us.  That's the fact.  So any asshole that wants to call up and say, why are you bashing Howard?  That's the situation.  You don't know what it's like to work in the same company as that asshole.  He's constantly doing shit like that behind the scenes. 
[01:59:30]  He didn't like that we were getting attention.  Of course not.  Right in his backyard.  It's all about Howie.  He gets all the attention.  No one else.  Right.  And as far as not believing us, as far as ripping off bits from everybody, he's taking another one of ours.  Oh, here you go.  Well, you know something.  We always come to the table with proof.  We don't just babble.  No.  We don't babble.  We actually show you guys.  And this is a prime example of this guy is going to satellite radio. 
[02:00:00]  He's going to Sirius end of the year.  He is obviously thinking about what to do, how it works,  how do you take a show from traditional broadcast radio to satellite radio.  It's something he hasn't done.  We have done this.  We know how it works now.  We've been doing this for a year.  We made the transition.  We're doing very well.  So what do you think he does?  Joe.  Yeah.  Say what you have to say.  What?  Say what you have to say. 
[02:00:30]  No, they fucking shit on me.  No, free speech and you hang up on me.  We gave you your shot.  Go away.  What, you want us to spend all day?  No, you didn't give me my shot.  You didn't listen to what I had to say.  We listened to exactly what you said and now we're addressing what you said.  We're not going to have an argument with you for the next half hour.  You stink at that.  I did address what you said too, man.  I was like, you got to address Anthony's point, dude.  Where'd he go?  I hung up on him.  We're done with him.  We can't spend all morning with Joe.  He said what he had to say and now we're addressing it.  Go ahead, Anthony. 
[02:01:00]  I forgot where I was now.  About a bit, why, something good on the internet there?  No.  All right.  Well, anyway, here's, oh, he's trying to figure out what to do with the satellite and  all that, right?  Yeah.  And then, obviously, you look at a show that has made a successful transition between traditional  terrestrial radio and satellite.  And he certainly seems to be taking some examples of what we're doing.  Well, we got some old friends still with the company and it has been told us that Howard  definitely does listen to the program. 
[02:01:30]  He has it in his Escalade.  So, there's no surprise that he came up with this brilliant idea last week.  But all these nudniks who file these complaints, one guy in Florida represents the entire state,  I guess.  But all these guys who file have forced radio to change.  They've made radio safe, again, for children.  And, unfortunately, the programming is going to suck and suck more.  And anyone who's out there trying to take risks and do some funny, edgy stuff, forget  about it.  It's not happening.  The only place you're going to hear that is on satellite when I go. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, that's where all the adults will have to go if they want to listen to something  that's not, you know, absolutely safe for the kitties.  Yeah.  Listen to the whole, she had nothing to add.  She had absolutely nothing to add once again.  Holy crap.  The only place you're going to get it is satellite.  Oh, when I go.  Make sure he says when I go.  Like there's nothing going on on satellite.  It's not happening already.  You cock.  What an ass.  And that hole with you that just repeats everything you say in another form. 
[02:02:30]  For the kitties.  Yeah.  And I'm busy putting together this channel.  And I'm going to tell you something.  On this channel that I'm creating, it is going to be a safe haven for about five or six radio  shows.  One of the channels is going to be, we're just going to handpick people.  People who are fed up with the system, who know the system is dirty.  And I will create a haven on the Howard Stern channel where these people will work and thrive.  And we will rise all from the ashes.  And we will become like it was with the WMCA good guys.  We will band together. 
[02:03:00]  In fact, any jock who joins my station.  You ever seen the mafia?  When a guy joins the mafia, you take a vow.  Yeah.  First you have to kill somebody, right?  Right.  You stupid hole.  I'm giving away what I want to call a silver certificate.  Our golden ticket thing that we're doing is getting a lot of press.  It's getting a lot of talk in the radio industry.  In the industry, yeah, it's very huge.  Some people see it as a serious thing. 
[02:03:30]  They're sending in tapes and stuff.  Other people see it as something funny that we're doing.  But it definitely has a buzz in the industry.  All the industry sites talking about it.  And there he goes.  There he goes.  With his big idea.  But you remember the ceremony?  Oh, yeah.  What do they do?  They burn you?  They burn you with a cigarette or something.  And then they kiss you.  We might even tattoo you.  I'm not sure what we're going to do to you.  Brand you.  We're going to brand you. 
[02:04:00]  But we are going to take some people off of this stuff, this terrestrial radio, and give them a new home, a new life, and let them be reborn.  And I will promote the hell out of them.  Part of the ceremony will be Fred will tongue kiss each of these men or women that we choose.  Tell them, Fred.  If they're willing to go through that with his coffee breath. 
[02:04:30]  You know.  Then you know they'll go through anything.  Omerita.  What do they call it?  Omerita.  Omerita.  Omerita.  Omerita.  Long live the Howard Stern Channel.  Quiet.  Stop whining.  Wow, that's a great idea.  I wonder where he got that one from.  Yeah, that's a good one. 
[02:05:00]  He truly is a genius.  He's rescuing people from terrestrial radio.  People weren't doing anything before he started doing radio.  I now believe that.  Mm-hmm.  What an ass.  What a complete ass.  You could actually hear it in his voice going,  I know this is Opie Anthony's idea, but it's too good.  I got to go with it.  I'll tell you this one, Rob.  Let me try to make this sound believable.  Believable. 
[02:05:30]  Fucking meat ditch.  Yeah.  Worthless.  Handing absolutely nothing on a daily basis.  For years.  He's the luckiest person in radio right there.  Radio Lotto.  Oh, God.  Well, there you have it.  That's his new idea.  It's brilliant.  I got to hand it to him.  It's brilliant.  It's brilliant.  All right.  We're going to take a break, I guess.  A radio.  A radio. 
[02:06:00]  A radio.  My grandmother used to say right-o.  Right-o.  Right-o.  Eat your pussy, Grandma.  Right-o.  Right-o.  Mm-hmm.  This is really quick.  From Fox & Friends.  I guess we have a pass that works for the network.  Uh-huh.  They were doing a Howie story and listen to what they added to the story.  I swear to God we're not adding this.  This is actual audio from Fox & Friends.  Viacom said, in the future, if we ever get a notice of apparent liability in regards  to one of our talent, in regards to one of our hosts, we will immediately suspend that 
[02:06:30]  host.  Well, you know what?  Suspend him.  Get-  Right.  Suspend him and let him do a show.  So he can get off and go to satellite radio.  They threw in the tell-em, Fred.  I'm telling you, we got pests everywhere.  That's really from Fox & Friends.  I swear to you.  They've infiltrated everything.  The pests are infiltrating everything.  Project mayhem.  Do you understand what's going on with this pest concept?  It is project mayhem.  Project mayhem.  They are infiltrating everything. 
[02:07:00]  The pests are just getting their little hands into everything.  They're everywhere.  They're all-knowing.  There's now a new website, by the way, called oapests.com.  Really?  Where they're just organizing and trying to figure out other ways to just be annoying fucking  pests.  I heard one of them even walk up to the producer, this is weird, and said,  could you sign this?  How cool is that, though?  That's hilarious.  And that's, what about the other one? 
[02:07:30]  What was that on CBS?  CBS.  Yeah.  These pests are everywhere.  I'm telling you, they're infiltrating.  They've fed a pat battle line into the telepropeller.  Teller.  The telepropter.  Proppeter.  The telecopter.  Yeah.  Telecopter.  The teleprior.  Do we have that one, no?  The ABC one?  Do we have that still there?  Let's hope so, Hawk.  Not that I saw.  That's the answer I want.  Eric.  Not that I saw.  The boss wants a yes or a no.  The boss wants a yes.  That is the answer I want from my right-hand man in the studio. 
[02:08:00]  Not that I saw.  How about we try to find it, Eric?  That's right, Hawk.  Find, find.  Considering we're talking about it right now, it would be a find thing to play.  That's right.  Basically, Julie, whatever her last name is.  Julie, yeah, from, who's sleeping with one of the big bosses there at Viacom.  Hold on.  Fox News alert.  Yeah.  Reports, the roof of the Superdome is leaking. 
[02:08:30]  The roof of the Superdome is leaking.  Part of Superdome roof has blown off.  The rain is pouring through the roof of the Superdome.  They just set up those people down there.  They had them wait in line for eight to ten hours to go into a place that's coming apart.  Who the hell runs the government down there in the KKK?  Won't y'all get into this here building? 
[02:09:00]  Y'all gonna be saving him.  Are you kidding me?  The roof is coming off the Superdome and leaking.  The roof.  The roof is leaking.  I'm sorry.  Could you please just hit that?  Thank you.  Yes.  Just for what I was thinking.  Oh, just for a thought.  Wow, that must have been a good one.  That must have been a good one.  Here's the pest thing we do.  I guess we played this before vacation, Anthony.  Yeah.  It's a pat battle for the new listeners.  It's such an inside joke. 
[02:09:30]  It's not even worth explaining at this point.  But someone that was writing down stuff for Julie Chen to read.  Yeah.  Decide to have a little fun.  Another one of our pests.  Someone deep inside the Viacom walls.  And if you have a question for Kaser, you can talk to him live tomorrow at 1 p.m. Eastern,  10 a.m. Pacific on House Calls.  The Big Brother Talk Show at cbs.com.  Next, it's the ultimate pat battle for power. 
[02:10:00]  Who will be the new head of household?  Damn, that is great.  How great is that?  How great is that?  The ultimate pat battle.  Read it, robot.  Just read it.  Read it.  Shut up.  Own a pest.  Starting to get themselves everywhere.  I love that.  Everywhere.  It's going to get so interesting from here on in.  And I guess we should acknowledge that new website, oapests.com, I believe. 
[02:10:30]  We should link it to opianathy.com.  All right.  We got an AP clip about the Superdome?  All right.  Hit that.  They said people in the dome won't even know what's going on outside because the walls are  so thick.  There's no danger of the roof coming off.  Oh, that was originally?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I won't even know what's going on.  God.  These news people, they don't know anything.  That's good.  News people don't know shit.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We'll take a quick break and we'll talk to Drew Curse.  At least say, Drew.  Hi, Drew.  Hey, hey.  What's up?  There he is. 
[02:11:00]  Spending him out for like two hours.  We'll see what he's up to next.  Oh, I got a ton of stuff, man.  We're in good shape.  Do you really?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus.  Human waste.  Where's that really crazy story before we go break?  Here it is.  Thank you, Eric.  Ooh.  Looks like somebody has rebounded from that UPN debacle.  Eric does a great job every day.  He really does.  Oh, well, hold on.  Young Timothy Hutton Harris pointing.  What happened, Derek?  Boy, Derek, I've never seen that young strapping buck jump up so fast. 
[02:11:30]  That idea came from in here, just to let you know.  What idea?  How about segging into that next story?  All right.  So I apologize, Eric.  Wow.  And they're all laughing.  No, but I gave you credit.  I thought you rebounded from a UPN failure, but you wasn't going to interrupt and say, oh,  yeah, Derek pointed that out while you were talking.  In fairness to stupid, he didn't interrupt.  There's a whole competition going on behind the scenes.  Oh, and it's fantastic. 
[02:12:00]  Just the way a fucking young lawyer from a Grisham novel jumped up.  That was from this fucking part of the organization.  That was from this part of the organization.  Oh, fuck.  We secretly hate that guy in there.  There's just different worlds on either side of that glass, man.  Oh, boy.  They really...  Oh, boy.  Look at they are rolling in there.  What happened?  You plugged your iPod into the computer?  Eric, what just happened? 
[02:12:30]  Wow, you're panicking.  Oh, he is panicking.  I wasn't even touching it until I just started playing stuff.  No, stop it.  Hello?  I swear, the gas, I hit the brake and the car lunged ahead.  How did it happen?  I killed 50 people on a pier.  Why was I driving on a pier?  I wasn't.  The car went left.  And the gas pedal.  I hit the brake and the gas went.  Weah.  Eric, you hit something.  Yes, you did.  Eric, fess up.  I didn't hit two miles at the same time. 
[02:13:00]  You hit something.  What, is it thinking for yourself?  I have to play tic-tac-toe so it will learn.  Shut up, stupid.  You panicked.  Hello?  So let's...  I'll play what I want, Eric.  I'll just play whatever I want.  Don't turn me off, Eric.  Wow, Hawk.  That was a panic of cataclysmic proportions.  What was the song they're playing?  That's the type of panic that in the army kills people. 
[02:13:30]  That's a friendly fire panic.  Or in NASA, it blows a ship up.  Here, you just get your ears blown out a little bit  and a room full of laughter on the other side of the glass.  It looks like a zoo back there, like they're all caged in glass.  And the name of that display is Really Happy White Guys.  Yep.  Oh, are they happy.  Pleased as punch.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[02:14:00]  How quickly would we be off the air?  Governor Barber, you with us?  How quickly would we be off the air if what went on off the air was on the air?  During commercials, during our little breaks.  Did some of that audio made it on the air?  Fired.  Colonel Keith Snyder.  Thank you very much for being with us.  We just heard the governor of Mississippi say that it seems like Louisiana 
[02:14:30]  might be spared by comparison.  But what's it like there this morning?  Well, if it's a comparison, we're both getting hammered.  We've got reports of a 20-foot storm surge in Orleans Parish, where New Orleans is.  We've got some damage to the roof of the Superdome that we're confirming the extent of the damage.  We have widespread power outages.  We have communication lines that are down. 
[02:15:00]  And we've got severe flooding in southeastern Louisiana.  And can you tell us a little bit more about the Superdome?  We had reported that a little while ago, that it would seem that there was some leaking there.  I guess there are like 10,000 people in the dome right now.  Are they going to be okay?  Yes, ma'am.  I guarantee it personally.  Yes, ma'am.  They're fine.  And you know they're back at Fox going,  Ah!  That's not the answer we wanted.  No, no.  We're not sure. 
[02:15:30]  It's caused by a gentleman climbed up in the rafters.  He's throwing barrels down on the people.  There's a small Italian man right up there.  Trying to get him.  Save the princes.  We have Drew Curtis in studio from FARC.com.  F-A-R-C-K.com.  A friend of the program definitely helps us out with a lot of our stuff.  We get a lot of hits from FARC.com.  Yes.  Before Drew, I have one quick question.  Where's the intern that I sent for a fucking blueberry frosted Pop Tart an hour ago? 
[02:16:00]  We got new interns.  New guy.  I know.  New guy, Jimmy.  First day.  We got to break in the new guys.  They don't understand.  So all that stuff you've heard us say about the interns, we get to start over again.  That's what sucks about our intern program.  By the time we got them nicely trained and where they have everything figured out,  they leave and go back to school or whatever.  And we get a whole new crew.  But I didn't ask for a Pop Tart.  It wasn't like I said go out and eat the Pop Tart.  All right.  We'll see what happens.  I'm hungry.  Drew Curtis. 
[02:16:30]  It's scary.  Do you have the Perv story on FARC.com?  Yeah, we do actually.  God, that just made me laugh all week long.  It was a beautiful thing.  You know what's funny is that that actually is a good example of some certain amount of  crimes that are going to be disappearing because camera phones exist.  That's one of them.  You know, muggings are, you know, that'll be another one.  Yeah, you're just taking anything face to face.  Everyone's got a camera now.  Yeah, there it is.  Or I just got hit by a car and it drove off.  Well, hit and run's going to be pretty much great.  Everybody's got a shot of it.  Everyone's got cameras.  There's cameras everywhere, surveillance cameras.  So it's very hard to do something without, if you don't get the actual act, you're getting 
[02:17:00]  you coming to or leaving the act.  Yeah, exactly.  So it's really hard these days to pull off the old jack and run.  And this guy thought he got away with something.  And we talk about it.  So if you're just turning in, maybe listen to the replay.  But basically, his picture was on the front page of the Daily News of him whacking it.  I'd love to continue talking about that story.  But obviously, there was a problem with Jimmy's Pop-Tarts.  I just saw Travis bring in a box of Pop-Tarts. 
[02:17:30]  Jimmy, fire off a note to Travis.  Travis, leave with the note and the Pop-Tarts.  He's going to toast it for me.  But it was just the guy.  One or two.  I just want to have Pop-Tarts.  You've got everyone in a panic here this night.  Three guys.  Look at a girl running around.  There's three guys that came running in behind Eric to see what your answer would be.  To the question if it's one or two.  How do I get that goodness in me?  Brian Regan's coming to Caroline's very soon. 
[02:18:00]  I can't wait.  I heard he canceled.  Oh, he did?  No, I just wanted to get you to react.  Damn.  Oh, no.  A little one.  I can't wait until just a little fucking...  Because you don't have the control I have.  You just get eager.  And I can't wait until one little wet one burbles out down the back of his leg.  Oh, I push.  He's got to leave.  I go for the push.  You push.  Go for volume.  Anyway, the perv picture is up on opianathene.com.  It's classic.  It's beautiful.  I mean, I was just thinking what was going through that guy's mind when he went to get  the papers thinking... 
[02:18:30]  What's going to be on the front page?  You know, Hurricane Katrina.  What's going to be the big story in there?  Oh, look at me.  It's his dopey face in the middle of jacking off.  God, that makes me laugh.  That's really creepy.  Can you imagine?  That's like getting your picture taken, like, you know, all of a sudden, like, there's  some undisclosed person getting into your vehicle with a blonde wig.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the Daily News article had, you know, his occupation, what he was doing, you know,  and all that kind of stuff.  Oh, he still was screwed.  Uh, he owns two restaurants and they, uh, what, what, uh, Chuck Raleigh from Pittsburgh. 
[02:19:00]  There he is.  Oh, my God.  Buy, bring, get your own damn food.  Quit pushing your prima donna demands on others.  Sheesh.  I get exhausted listening to this crap.  Did he actually write sheesh?  Sheesh.  Yeah.  How do you spell that?  S-H-E-E-Z-E.  I understand what he's saying.  He's a common person.  And common people will sometimes feel that way.  But what you don't understand, of course, you're from Pittsburgh.  Fancy people get service. 
[02:19:30]  Right.  I'm a fancy man.  I gave up on that, uh, months ago.  I bring in all my own food.  I don't.  I have three or four stages of breakfast that I go through every morning.  Chuck Raleigh to, uh, get our own food.  You know what, something?  You know, you know what?  Chuck Raleigh.  Ban.  Absolutely.  Here we go.  Good point, Anthony.  No, you can't ban the guy.  First, I gotta click on his name.  And you can't ban him.  Ban.  No, no, don't ban him.  He was just talking about food.  No, he wasn't.  He was just talking about, and don't ban him.  One click away.  Don't ban him. 
[02:20:00]  Bring your own stuff.  Don't ban him.  He's okay.  I think not.  I get one more chance.  He's okay.  Then I ban him.  He was just a little agitated.  That's all right.  You know what I do when I want food?  I can understand that.  I do this.  Farid away.  Common person.  Fancy.  Anyway, Drew Kers, what do you have?  Well, more breaking news on the Superdome.  They've, uh, they've retracted their original statement and now said the lining has come off  of the roof.  Not the roof off of the Superdome. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, is that it?  The lining came off the roof, so now it's leaking on those poor bastards.  So they go to a partial roof collapse.  Yeah.  It's all over there all day.  Oh, no, wait.  It's just a little leak.  Yeah, that's how it goes.  What's funny is, is, uh, we were talking earlier, uh, heard you guys talking about the, what's  been going on in the news, you know, with all the, you know, the crazy, oh my God, we're  going to die stories or whatnot.  Sensationalism.  So I ran out and compiled a whole collection of them.  Oh, yeah.  I want to make a point.  I mean, obviously this is a very serious, uh, no, absolutely other story, but yeah, but  they made it even more ridiculous, uh, with the, the, the fear and the scare tactics. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, they're making a mockery.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Obviously it's a major hurricane hitting the New Orleans area and it's very serious.  But the picture they painted last night into early this morning was ridiculous.  Total devastation.  And in fact, speaking of ridiculous, it goes even further.  Um, all of the articles on the destruction involved in New Orleans are actually citing one  guy.  Yeah.  One LSU professor, which probably means only one of these news outfits, I actually interviewed 
[02:21:30]  the guy.  Everybody else just went over and copied and pasted everything he said.  Right, right.  Well, dude, which, which news orifice actually talked to him today though?  Well, that's a good question.  Yeah, they got, uh, they got this one guy and his vision of this was just apocalyptic.  Yeah, basically.  There's going to be nothing of New Orleans left.  And here's the quotes.  This may be our case.  Who was it, Ben Sparks?  Yeah, who knows?  Some guy at LSU, which right there, that's a premier university if there ever was one, you  know.  Don't just say it's going to look like my head after a shower. 
[02:22:00]  Who the hell are you talking about?  This may be our Asian tsunami.  That's right.  Two hundred and fifty thousand people are going to die across three continents as a result  of this hurricane, according to this guy.  Uh, he also talks about how the, uh, all of the chemical refining plants around New Orleans  are going to simultaneously explode, leak into the bay, and then catch on fire.  Yeah, and make a toxic soup.  A toxic soup, which of sewage and chemicals burning as it rolls out into the Gulf, destroying 
[02:22:30]  everything in its path.  It wasn't good enough for this guy and the news to, uh, go off and say that there's going  to be a thirty foot flood of New Orleans, but it had to be on fire.  Yes, it had to be on fire.  The water can't just be water.  It's not bad enough.  You need flaming water to come over those, uh, levees.  And almost if it was a segue in the same interview, then he goes on to talk about the danger posed  to people fleeing higher grounds from fire ants.  Right.  I heard about this. 
[02:23:00]  Because the fire ants have got to get out of the way of the water, too, and so as you  are climbing the only tree left and dry, above dry land, the fire ants will be right behind  you to eat your courts.  Kicking you to pieces.  There's going to be skeletons of people in trees all across New Orleans.  With big, fat ants burping.  Don't you think the water would run over the ants and kill them?  What do you think?  They have the news channel?  They're watching their annuals.  They know how to climb trees.  Here's what ants do.  How are you doing?  It's wet!  And they die.  Here's what the fire ants do.  They ball up and float on the water. 
[02:23:30]  This is actually true.  This is true.  They actually do.  They do.  The fire ants...  No, no, I know.  I know.  ...know to get into a big, their colony, and they ball up and float until they find something  dry, and then get up on them.  Yeah, like say, you know, somebody climbing through a tree.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Drew, how did you know that?  I believe the Discovery Channel.  Again, Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Must watch out for the fire ants. 
[02:24:00]  Balls of fire ants.  Balls of fire ants.  You know, I knew that they kind of balled up into a fire, but when I said it, it kind  of came out like they just drowned.  But no, that's kind of where I was going with it.  That makes perfect sense.  Once again, I looked away.  Jimmy looked down at his Pop-Tarts and studied his Pop-Tarts to make sure they were right.  The fire ants tend to ball up.  This is hot.  That's right.  Of course, then there's the floating coffins.  Let's not forget that.  Yeah, this is a big thing.  The floating coffins.  We all know that in New Orleans, they don't bury their dead. 
[02:24:30]  They're buried above the ground because the ground is so saturated with water that they  bury them in mausoleums and things above the ground.  So if the floods came in and you had 30 feet of water, all these old coffins would start  floating around.  Just float right up.  Yeah, except for one thing.  They've all got big concrete tombs on top of them.  You ever seen a cemetery?  Yeah.  It's made out of concrete.  There's a half a ton of concrete weighing these things down.  They're not going to float off.  Yeah, I don't think they're floating away, but that guy had a coffin, which of course 
[02:25:00]  the fire ants could climb up onto, so now you have a corpse full of fire ants chasing  you down the flaming river.  This was the picture they're painting.  That's right, exactly.  And it gets better, though.  The NOAA, actually, I'm going to read this verbatim, okay?  Verbatim, I guess.  That's right.  Have you been criticized on your pronunciation of verbatim?  Yes, repeatedly.  I can't stop saying it, so there you go.  But, okay, here's this.  This is actually word for word what came across on the wire later this morning.  He says, okay, National Weather Service, not the media, most of the area will be uninhabitable 
[02:25:30]  for weeks, perhaps longer.  Like after Jimmy farts in the studio.  Exactly.  At least one half of the well-constructed homes will have roof and wall failure.  All gabled roofs will fail, leaving the home severely damaged.  All of them.  All gabled roofs.  All of them.  The majority of industrial buildings will become non-functional, partial to complete wall and  roof failure is expected.  All wood-framed, low-rising apartment buildings will be destroyed.  Destroyed.  Destroyed.  This is the weather service.  Concrete block, low-raised apartments will sustain major damage, including some wall and 
[02:26:00]  roof failure.  Which, I guess, apparently, if you're an industrial building, you're gone.  This is what happens when Godzilla drops through your city.  Exactly.  This is the same thing as Godzilla coming through your city.  It's a beautiful thing.  They are out of control.  They pumped it up like an action movie, and you want to see it end with the big ending.  People trapped in an apartment collapse.  Now they're saying massive pieces of the Superdome roof are flying off. 
[02:26:30]  That's what I just saw on CNN.  They're huge.  Massive pieces.  They're flying through the air, landing on the fire ants.  Interestingly enough, speaking of the Superdome, there was an article last year when Hurricane  Ivan just barely missed New Orleans, and they happened to roll a few of those scaremongering  ones out before it actually hit.  One of the articles was on a debate on whether or not the Superdome should even be used as 
[02:27:00]  any kind of a hurricane shelter.  In particular, one of the things that they cited as danger to the Superdome being used during  a hurricane is that there are now high-rise apartment buildings surrounding it, which  will create, and I quote, a wind tunnel effect.  Oh, the wind tunnel effect.  I guess turning the entire block into one giant tornado of people and fire ants or something.  People, fire ants, big balls of fire ants flying into your face.  Hotel collapse in Harvey, Louisiana, people trapped.  Good times.  Okay. 
[02:27:30]  As far as you know.  One hotel down.  Well, these are, but all the rest are going.  These are all the idiots that decide to stay.  Did you see those big casino barges they have?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right there.  I mean, what do you do?  That's just, it's got to go.  Yeah.  Got to be torn to pieces.  They're made of wood just sitting there in the water.  Great.  9,000 residents taken up in the Superdome, and they have reported massive pieces.  They use the word massive, pieces of the roof have torn away. 
[02:28:00]  Like massive head wound trauma when you get hit by wood.  Oh, look out.  Parts of the roof blowing off and leaking.  My God, it's pandemonium.  It's everywhere.  What about the levees?  And strangely enough, by international news, oil has gone up over $70 a barrel.  Guess why?  Oh, well, the hurricane.  The hurricane, of course.  They had to shut down the rigs out in the Gulf.  I did hear about this one.  Now, I understand they're shutting the rigs down, but realistically.  They had to stop production to make sure the workers were safe. 
[02:28:30]  How long did they stop in production where it's got to go up now over $70?  Yeah.  That's right.  It went up like about 10%.  Is there really that much production going on just in New Orleans to warrant that kind of a price drive?  Doesn't it take time for something to happen to it to make it to the pumps?  Yeah.  These savages that run these gas stations jack the price up the second something happens.  And it's immediate.  The second something happens, price goes up in the pumps.  And yet when maybe oil production increases and the price per barrel drops, they sit there and go, 
[02:29:00]  well, it takes a lot of time to trickle down to actually lower prices here.  A liar.  Breaking news.  Breaking news.  I want you to keep the mayor there as well. 
[02:29:30]  Tornado warning for Jefferson Parish, including Kenner and Metairie, also Orleans Parish,  including the city of New Orleans.  Now the National Weather Service at 832, indicating many now, many reports are coming in stating  total structural failure in the New Orleans metro area.  What?  Seeks substantial cover now.  Winds are gusting to over 120 miles per hour. 
[02:30:00]  Actually, he was reading that report I just read earlier.  Here is the storm.  What we have now is New Orleans on the easy side.  Can you believe that?  120 on this side, 140 on this side.  Total structural failure.  And I'm wondering how long these levees are going to hold on Lake Pontchartrain.  Rob Marciano is up in Biloxi.  Rob, you've got structural failure in some spots, too.  Oh, in a big way, Chad.  Easily wins now.  Sustained.  80, 90 miles an hour gusts to 110, 120.  Look at this.  The undercarriage of this awning, it's being torn apart. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, fall off and take his head off.  Light fixtures, light bulbs.  Please take his head off.  Blow off and flying everywhere.  We're protected somewhat by three sides of stucco and concrete.  Stucco and concrete.  That'll hurt.  That'll save you.  As we speak.  Look at all the debris down here.  This is not only from the awning, but also flashings from pieces of the roof and the gutter.  All littering now.  This area.  The gutter.  Damaging cars in the car.  Yeah, really?  He's outside.  Going outside.  The cars are all fine. 
[02:31:00]  They're just sitting there, unscathed.  They love being outside in it.  This is a major event, and the only thing this guy could find is a gutter.  Oh, he's got some siding ripping off.  Yeah, aluminum siding comes off if you sneeze on it.  This is shit.  Fox stinks.  My God, it's windy.  A piece of something blew off.  Who fucking cares?  Stop panicking, everybody.  Find the real damage if you're going to be out there.  Where's the footage of a massive piece of the Superdome?  This cocksucker is under an awning which blew off. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  All right.  What else you got there?  I understand, by the way, breaking news.  A guy's hat blew off somewhere in Baton Rouge.  There's a derby.  Rolling down the street.  Get your children out of the way.  And me.  Roll over and slice their little feet off.  They give them head cover.  This just in, they're warning people because the water levels are rising, that you're in  danger of attacks by gators.  Yes.  I swear to God, this is a real story now.  We're not making this one up. 
[02:32:00]  Last night, and I'm not making this up.  Last night, I'm watching the news, Fox News.  I believe Geraldo was talking to some guy out in the field.  And he was behind some kind of swampy thing that was being flooded.  And behind him was an alligator.  It was sitting there.  And he didn't notice.  No one noticed.  I had to stop and rewind like eight times and go, oh, my God, there's a frigging alligator  behind this guy.  And he doesn't even notice.  Geraldo didn't notice. 
[02:32:30]  No one noticed.  And that's another thing.  They're panicking people out.  The sea, the little swamp creatures now, they're very afraid that when the levees give  way and all that water washes in from the swamps, that all these swamp creatures and critters  are going to be loose like water snakes and all these poisonous things and alligators  are going to be rolling around with the ants and the fire ants and just eating on the corpses.  This is like every bad, you wouldn't, it's a bad movie. 
[02:33:00]  It is.  It really is.  And crocodiles.  Is there another, I heard there's another Fox breaking news story somewhere.  Is there a breaking news alert?  Oh.  A reporter in Biloxi just came out and said that people are having trouble lighting their  cigarettes outdoors.  This could hurt the tobacco industry.  I think this could be long lasting damage.  The price of a pack is going to rise $2 tomorrow. 
[02:33:30]  Of course.  And I don't know if you know, there are reports though of absolute panic in the kite industry.  Lawsuits resulting in people flying away.  All right, Drew, what else?  Well, the converse of all this outrageous stuff we're talking about is this article that  was run by ABC News yesterday, which is a thousand words.  I kid you not.  I printed it up.  Three pages.  The French Quarter is dead as the hurricane approaches.  They wrote a thousand word article on that.  The French Quarter is dead. 
[02:34:00]  Nobody's there.  Yeah.  Everybody went home because the hurricane was coming.  A thousand word article.  And they just basically had interviewed people like, I'm not leaving.  I own this restaurant.  It's like, no, good God, man.  I mean, with all the other, you know, fire ants and corpses and whatever.  And they got the guy going, yeah, nobody's drinking anything right now.  Isn't it pretty much known that people evacuated?  I think.  I don't know.  A thousand words.  Why even say that?  Why point out the obvious?  And also, the sun came up this morning.  But here's the kicker.  You knew this was going to happen.  The Coast Guard earlier this morning rescued 13 surfers off Texas.  Guess why they were there?  Surfing wanted a big wave. 
[02:34:30]  Big wave.  Here comes the hurricane.  We're going to go out and do it.  And then they got washed out to sea.  Yeah.  Fox News was yelling at people that were on the beach yesterday.  Saw that.  They had surfboards.  They weren't in the water.  But they were like, I can't believe there are people out there endangering their lives.  Like us.  There's the piece of the suit.  Is that it?  All right.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be like three foot by three foot.  That could start something good, though.  That's a big hole.  Come on.  That could start something good.  A lot of rain.  You've got to be fair.  That's a big hole in the roof for the Superdome.  Yeah, there's a few of them, actually, I think. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Well, if they end up ripping the rest of it off.  Who was the brainiac that thought that was going to work?  Yeah.  Good question.  Well, isn't it a weird type?  The structure is not like real concrete, right?  Isn't it some kind of a weird thing that retracts?  The Superdome is, what, 30 years old?  It has to be a little wear and tear at this point.  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  Wow.  That's some big holes in the roof, actually.  Yeah.  Pouring several small holes in the Superdome roof.  They're saying massive damage.  And then this one is saying several small holes.  You have to circle it in case you miss it.  See?  It's a fabric, and like most domes or mini domes, it is a fabric material that covers 
[02:35:30]  the metal structure, the skeleton, so to speak, of the dome.  And it is that fabric that has torn in several parts.  These shots taken by NBC's Brian Williams, who is inside that.  We spoke with him about 20 minutes or so ago.  And he pointed out the biggest problem right there is for the folks who are beneath that  and getting wet.  Getting wet.  With the eight or so inches of rain that has already fallen on parts of New Orleans already.  We heard from Governor Blanco as well that there are some structural problems at some  of the shelters in the low-lying areas.  But so far, no major safety concerns. 
[02:36:00]  But she did mention that they felt that too many people stayed behind as far as they were concerned.  And they're just begging those people who did stay inside to stay where they are,  not to venture out this evening, and for those folks who did leave, not to try and get back to their homes.  At least they're doing responsible reporting.  That's not panic.  So far, no major safety concerns.  That's the way reporting should be done.  Exactly.  Not massive, massive damage.  I'm patient.  The whole roof is gone, except for a sliver.  Fire ants coming through the hole. 
[02:36:30]  I think we have some cursing on Fox.  Listen to this.  What are you guys doing?  You're not on Fox News Channel.  What are you doing?  Walking at dogs.  Why are you still here?  I'm just curious.  Good.  You're still in your fucking business.  Oh, that was a good answer, wasn't it?  That was right on there.  Financial dollars, and thanks so much for that.  Well, you know, that's why we apologize.  That's the attitude.  You know, you've got an attitude.  That's the attitude.  I'm watching two dogs drink out of a glass of ice water, and it's all my business water still. 
[02:37:00]  Wow.  I love it.  That guy tore into him.  None of your fucking business.  It's really hard to hear, but yeah, asking him, why are you still there?  And he says, none of your fucking business.  He just said, why are you here?  Your experience to run out of a hurricane?  Now, if the guy would have said, aren't you afraid?  Don't you have safety concerns?  The guy probably would have answered him.  But being confrontational, the guy bit his head off.  Yeah.  I wish he was a pit bull.  Oh, look up.  There's a brilliant man being interviewed.  Oh, no.  Quick, turn it up.  Kind of like I got some trees broke off in the backyard and stuff. 
[02:37:30]  Good.  Thank you.  I ain't never been through nothing like this.  I used to live in Pennsylvania.  She tapped out.  Blew the teeth right out of her head.  Like I said, you can see where it's all.  Oh, there are a couple.  Good.  You know, breaking down tree branches and things, but we're not going to run.  And it should be noted here, the folks in Houma, Louisiana are actually on the good side of the hurricane right now.  So the, you know.  All right.  The good side.  Yeah.  Caroline.  Or is it Caroline? 
[02:38:00]  Caroline.  It's Caroline.  Yes, sir.  From Louisiana.  Yeah, from Louisiana, but luckily west of the storm.  Oh, really?  Breaking news.  Some lawn chairs have blown over.  Get out of the way if you're in a backyard.  By the way, the umbrella industry has issued a warning.  Do not open any in the danger area. 
[02:38:30]  How are you doing there, Caroline?  Caroline.  Caroline.  Caroline.  Like, Caroline's the comedy.  Why do y'all know that?  Why can't we all just pick one of those names and just go with it?  Confusing every time.  Well, I was actually calling to tell y'all that the ant thing is not really a Professor Anthony.  I mean, everybody down here knows about the ants just from the front yard when it rains.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, you haven't got them in your front yard.  That's pretty much common knowledge.  Are they that evil, though?  They're pretty ruthless, but the thing is, they don't act, they ball up, yes, but they have 
[02:39:00]  to keep moving.  They can't just ball up and be still.  So, if you get, like, if you put your finger in it, like, if some stupid little kid wants  to be dumb and put their finger in it, they'll crawl all over you.  Well, did you hear that?  Apparently, we're getting some big reports that in Biloxi, the helium-filled balloon  industry is in a panic because sales are going to be down for the next two days.  Some New Orleans homes flooded to ceilings. 
[02:39:30]  To the ceilings.  Yeah.  That levy, it will not hold, obviously.  It's going to be...  Yeah, there's going to be some pretty bad damage, but luckily, they're on the good side, so...  Are the pumps pumping?  Hey.  Are the pumps pumping, Caroline?  No offense to anyone that lives down there, but Anthony and I went down to broadcast from  two Mardi Gras.  Is there really going to be a lot of damage?  You won't notice the difference.  No, please clean the puke out of the street.  Tom's actually standing outside with a toothbrush.  At least the city will get washed off with the water. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  It's so filthy, but the problem is it's so far under sea level that, you know, once they're  flooding, you just can't stop it.  Well, do they have a sewage system there?  They do, right?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, but it's like the water table's like, you know, it won't be there.  Yeah, it's not good.  All right.  If I could say something...  Thanks y'all so much.  Y'all are awesome.  Bye-bye.  We'll see y'all every day.  I haven't heard it said yet.  New Orleans is like a bowl. 
[02:40:30]  In case you didn't hear that.  Enough with the bowl.  Wasn't there some kind of a levee?  Like some guy drove a Chevy to it and it was dry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some good old boys down there drinking something, huh?  My hat blew off and then he came in my eye.  Fucking dumb song.  Dude, it means Elvis.  Yeah, it does it.  We should do wacky radio today and just play songs with the word levee in it.  Did he fuck that up?  Because it means Elvis.  Elvis.  Whatever it means.  I don't even...  That shows you what I know.  And the Martian band refused... 
[02:41:00]  Did they stop marching?  Eight minute song?  We get it.  When that song comes on, I cannot change it quickly enough.  It's like long...  Get it?  Yeah.  A long...  Gone.  They took the last train from...  Really?  And then like ten minutes later you think you're safe.  You go back.  Bye, bye, Mrs. Shut Up.  I understand Steve is panicking because he heard down in New Orleans that the honey jars  have been blown off the shelves. 
[02:41:30]  The fire ants have stolen his shirts.  I can still remember how that music used to make me smile.  Well, they'll tell you all about it in real time right now.  I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy.  I'd see that gift in Ben's pants.  But she said you were in the rain.  The song's longer than the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[02:42:00]  With every paper I'd deliver, bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step.  Okay, so the paper got delivered and it was bad news.  I got that.  I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride.  Whose widowed bride?  Something touched me deep inside.  It's Catholic.  The day the music died. 
[02:42:30]  And here we go.  Whose widowed bride?  Buddy Holly.  Frankenstein.  Oh, bye, bye, Miss America.  Who's she?  I don't know.  I drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.  Why?  Was it dry?  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rock.  Because they cried so much there were no more tears left, I think.  Oh, why were the good old boys drinking?  Why are they drinking saying that if the levee's dry?  Exactly.  There's no threat.  Why would he take a Chevy to it? 
[02:43:00]  This guy's got a real cock.  It's like taking a Chevy into a ditch.  It's drunk driving, you fucking rat.  All right.  All right, we get it.  Right.  We get it.  It was a big day.  Yeah, we know.  It's stuck.  It's weird, slow.  Well, I know that you're in love.  We're taking conviction. 
[02:43:30]  Why don't you write a song called Fly Commercial, you chintzy jizzbags?  The sumptuous ass that someone would want to sit through a song this long.  What?  Rockin' Buck.  Six minutes left.  And you'll hear every minute here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's right.  Better than playing commercial.  Goodbye, goodbye, Miss American Pie.  Bye, everybody.  Miss American Pie. 
[02:44:00]  Why?  Stop it.  Okay, terrific.  Stop it.  The boys were drinking whiskey and rye and singing this song.  And Ben came in and said,  Dude, I'm doing Boston, I did something.  What?  Kevin in Jersey, go ahead.  What's up, man?  I got a funny little air show, guys.  Yeah?  It is actually James King's Widow and Bride.  Yeah?  I actually, that's the first thing I thought of was when he was thinking about Jackie Onassis.  Or Jackie Kennedy. 
[02:44:30]  What?  My first song was Jackie Kennedy.  He was a jester.  I don't know.  And we were the king and queen.  I don't know.  James Dean.  I know there's a whole website that explains every single line of the goddamn song.  If one more person sends me the hidden meanings to The Shining, it's fucking wrong.  Of course it is.  Nonsense.  Stop looking for shit.  Kubrick was a genius, but he didn't go that deep.  Are we done with this song?  Does it get any?  No, I want to hear more opening.  No.  No.  And while Lennon read a book on Marx, a quartet practiced in the park, and we sang dirges in 
[02:45:00]  the dark the day the music died.  What does that mean?  I think it's about the Kennedy assassination.  Well, I want to hear more of that song.  What happened to it?  Let's say hi to Kenny in South Carolina.  Kenny.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Kenny's the comedian around here.  What's up, Kenny?  Ha, ha, ha.  I was going to tell you, you're missing the obvious Levy song. 
[02:45:30]  Are you?  When the Levy Breaks by Led Zeppelin.  Well, I was thinking we could just play Levy songs all day for dollars.  Or clips of Bob Levy.  He's funny.  Yeah.  All right.  What's going on, guys?  When the Levy Breaks, right?  I die.  This will be the day that I die.  Oh, that's the Manson thing, right? 
[02:46:00]  I see.  Maybe the music died when JFK was shot because everything changed, and maybe he's going through  other things that happened.  Because there was a marching band that kind of wouldn't yield.  He's got a fill eight minutes, though.  Is he talking about the 60s?  I know.  I'm thinking he did.  Yeah.  But why wouldn't the marching band stop?  It's all about the music of the time.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's what it is, and how rock and roll changed after Buddy Holly's plane crashed.  Yeah.  It got better.  Of course it did. 
[02:46:30]  I like Buddy Holly, you know, but come on.  The big bopper?  Who gave a shit about it?  Bob?  Hello, baby.  Yeah.  Oh, Chantilly Lace.  Shut up.  We're too low, baby.  Shouldn't fly in the snow, baby.  Oh, Chantilly Lace.  Fuselage in my face.  Shut your big bopper face, stupid.  Have a seat cushion in the mouth. 
[02:47:00]  Hello, baby.  Yeah, this is the big bopper speaking.  All right, you're not clear of the landing.  Could you shut that guy up and listen to the air traffic controller?  And a ponytail.  We're plummeting down.  Mike in Oklahoma. 
[02:47:30]  Hello?  Hi.  Why is this funny that people are going to die in New Orleans?  We're making fun of the...  First of all...  Goddamn...  How are we supposed to do a show when the goddamn death dedication, people dying?  We're making fun of the news coverage and the panic of the news coverage.  And the reality is we don't know them.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter if you don't know them.  Dude, how do you not get...  People dying.  Mike, people die every single day. 
[02:48:00]  Yes.  People die every single day.  And I bet a lot of people you hang out with die more often than that, judging by your voice.  Go visit a friend with a poodle recently, have you?  Ah, yes.  That's hilarious.  Yes, it is.  Oklahoma, huh?  How's it going in Oklahoma today?  It was fine until you start making fun.  We're making fun of what?  What did we say specifically...  Hold on, hold on.  What did we say specifically about either people dying or the hurricane that offended you and 
[02:48:30]  thought we were making fun of people dying?  I don't know.  Maybe, like, the whole last 45 minutes of your show?  What?  No, specifically.  What was the thing we said?  What was the thing?  You're playing When the Levee Breaks and it's...  No, we played Bye Bye Miss American Pie and we talked about how much the song stinks.  And the news coverage and how they try to panic you and MSNBC was the only one doing  it accurately and actually reporting what was going on.  No, they're not panicking anybody.  Yes, they are.  I think these news networks...  They've hyped this like a movie. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, they're doing a disservice to the rest of the country, you know, putting the fear  in all of us.  Absolutely.  And I don't mean...  I'm not...  And that's what we're pointing out.  Yes.  They basically said last night on TV that New Orleans would be no more.  Yes.  It wouldn't exist after today.  So, like, I understand that you and your faggot voice, you kind of...  You hear this...  Oh, man.  Excuse me?  You kind of have a little bit of a faggot voice.  And I understand that you hear this and you shoot for the pink team, don't you?  Excuse me, Mr. Monster Rain.  Exactly.  Me and my faggot voice, okay.  Boy, you listen to this show a lot, don't you? 
[02:49:30]  Wow.  Good boy.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  He knows you picked the one thing that really turned him on.  I've never had dick in my mouth.  How about you, Norton?  Well, you probably took it right in your keister, didn't you, little fella?  Why waste time in the mouth when you can be in there pushing stool?  The mouth is a waste of time, you silly goose.  Shove it in my ass so I can go, ooh, ah.  You are laughing at people dying.  No, I'm laughing at your faggoty voice.  You do have a faggot voice, and I don't mean any disrespect by that.  But you have to admit, people have questioned your sexuality by your voice.  Yeah.  How many times has that happened? 
[02:50:00]  Many times.  Yeah.  So why when I say that, do you get to face a good man?  But I'm a faggot.  I'm a faggot, and I'm proud.  And you've never had a dick in your mouth?  You just lied.  No, I've never had dick in my mouth.  What kind of faggot doesn't have dick in his mouth?  A good faggot.  See?  No.  A bad faggot.  You're not a good faggot.  A good faggot has a dick in his mouth.  Matter of fact, a good faggot has one in each hand and one on the chin.  A good faggot puts his dick in a mouth.  No.  No.  No, sir. 
[02:50:30]  You never reciprocated once in your life?  Selfish.  Yeah, exactly.  It's all about you.  It is.  And I like it like that.  All right.  Well, this call turned hot quickly.  Yeah.  No.  You know what?  Now it's about faggot.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Do you want to kiss me on the mouth?  Yes.  I'm going to stick my hard cock in your mouth.  You want to feel it?  Hello.  You want to feel it?  Just a fuck face.  Stop calling me that. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Do you want to kiss me?  Mike, yeah.  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth.  Mike was getting us some juicy stuff there, Ope.  He's still there, Mike.  Hello?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'm still here, and you still haven't properly defended yourself about laughing about people dying.  Yes, we did.  We did, and the bottom line is...  There's going to be crocodiles and alligators roaming around the streets, biting people.  All right.  We get you now.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Is the song still going on, you think? 
[02:51:30]  Oh, the marching band refused to yield.  Hey, how come you guys are making fun of people who sang Shantilly Lates?  The marching band was that important?  You know, he missed the whole point about that.  You know, we were talking about MSNBC doing a good job in their coverage.  Did you hear what they were saying?  We hear that there are some problems with the Superdome.  Everybody's okay.  Nothing to panic about.  No big deal.  MSNBC was doing it right.  Fox and CNN are like, the whole world's coming down.  Fire ants and corpses and everything's going to crap. 
[02:52:00]  Fox is...  And did you notice, by the way, in the Big Barber song,  Shantilly Lace, bring me...  Ramone, bring me some Shantilly Lace.  Oh, Ramone, you know what I like.  Good times.  You guys want some other news other than the hurricane?  All right.  Give it a shot. 
[02:52:30]  But February made me shiver.  Buddy Holly died on February 3rd, 1959, in a plane crash in Iowa during a snowstorm.  The news came to most of the world on the morning of February 3rd,  which is why it's known as the day the music died.  I never have come across a February 3rd.  With every paper I'd deliver, Don McClain's only job, besides being a full-time songwriter,  was being a little boy.  Caddy at the Cussing Club?  No?  Yeah.  Air traffic control?  What'd the little lad do? 
[02:53:00]  Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.  Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye, singing,  This'll be the day that I die.  This'll be the day that I die.  Well, one of Holly's hits was, That'll Be the Day.  Oh, okay.  The chorus contains the line, That'll be the day that I die.  When you say goodbye, that'll be the day.  By the way, dude, you missed this right here.  Oh.  You have to, there's a line up here, because, where the hell is it? 
[02:53:30]  It's a line here about, see this I didn't see.  Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step.  I can't remember if I cried, and there was an explanation.  Yeah.  When I read about his widowed bride, see Holly's recent bride, Maria Alena.  Oh, this is terrible.  Was pregnant when the crash took place, and she miscarried.  Oh!  Jeez.  Well, I know you're in love with him, because I saw you dancing in the gym. 
[02:54:00]  Slow dancing could just be dancing, or it could be vertical making out.  It wasn't hard to watch a couple slow dancing, and figure out whether they had some sort of  relationship, if you knew anything about slow dancing.  God.  You guys want to know any more?  No.  This is great.  Where are you?  All this, because there's a levy in, uh, New Orleans.  But that's not how it used to be, when the jester sang for the king and queen.  We asked about that one.  Well, the jester is Bob...  The jester is Bob Dylan. 
[02:54:30]  What?  As will become clear later, there are several interpretations of king and queen.  Some think that Elvis Presley is the king, which seems pretty obvious.  The queen is said to be either Connie Francis or Little Richard.  If he's singing about Connie Francis, I'll fucking, I'll put a bullet in his face.  If he's actually put Connie Francis on the rock side.  An alternate interpretation is that this refers to the Kennedys, the king and queen of Camelot,  who were present at a Washington, D.C. civil rights rally, featuring Martin Luther King. 
[02:55:00]  Troublemakers.  You almost tripped up his name there.  I know.  Oh, and while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown.  This could be a reference to Elvis' decline and Dylan's ascendance.  The thorny crown might be a reference to the price of fame.  Dylan has said that he wanted to be as famous as Elvis, one of his early idols.  How about this?  Somebody says to Don McLean, hey, faggot, what's that song about?  Oh, it's a whole thing.  Pumps failing. 
[02:55:30]  Pumps failing.  In New Orleans, pumps are failing.  Just came up on Fox News.  Structural damage throughout New Orleans.  Oh, my God, there's another one.  Due to the high winds, comb sales are up 2,000%.  Let's see the song.  Oh, God, stop. 
[02:56:00]  All right, wait, I've got to look up that one.  What was that one again?  Breaking Satan's Spell.  Satan's Spell.  Something about Satan's Spell.  Satan's Spell.  Talking about Ozzy.  Fallout Shelter.  Yield.  Oh, well, that's too long of an explanation.  Friends.  Okay.  And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage.  Which voice?  No.  Oh, angel born in hell could break that Satan's Spell. 
[02:56:30]  While playing a concert at the Altamont Speedway in 1968, the Stones appointed members of the Hell's Angels to work security.  Stop.  On the advice of the Grateful Dead.  In the darkness near the front of the stage, a young man named Meredith Hunter was beaten and stabbed to death by the angel.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  The Public outcry that the song Sympathy for the Devil had somehow, inside of the violence, caused the Stones to drop the song from their show for the next six years. 
[02:57:00]  This incident is chronicled in the documentary film Gimme Shelter.  It goes on and on.  All right.  We should take a break.  Anything else you got there, Drew?  Well, I got a bunch of little quickies, but however much you want.  What do you need?  Let's see if the song's still going first of all.  I drove my shed to the levee, but the levee was dry.  And good old boys were taking whiskey and fries.  Singing this will be the day that I die.  Uh-huh. 
[02:57:30]  This will be the day that I die.  All right, it's fading out here, I guess, right?  No.  I met a girl who sang the blues.  Garbage dick from...  Garbage dick.  I'm not sure where he's from.  He said, Jimmy, don't you mean sales of Afro pics?  You said combs, silly goose.  No, well, Afros wouldn't really get that messed up in the wind, I don't think.  In the wind?  They don't look like the fine...  Look like jerry curl after a while, I think.  Well, yeah, maybe just they all blow to the left like a palm tree and then come back out. 
[02:58:00]  Because Afro hair doesn't get messy like our hair does.  By the way, if you're...  Like our hair, which is fun to touch and change.  Put your fingers through.  If you want real coverage, you can go to XM247.  Oh, really?  What is that?  That's the emergency channel.  Every time there's an emergency, they do a little something on 247, because it's 24-7, get it?  Oh!  So they have an emergency channel that activates when this stuff happens, 247.  Eric Logan, by the way, did send me a page, and he's standing in the epicenter of the hurricane, and not one hair is out of place. 
[02:58:30]  Of course not.  They also described New Orleans.  They said it was a bowl, but they also described it as the thing that Eric puts over his head before a haircut.  No.  I didn't think I worded that properly.  He just stumbled through a bowl.  I stumbled.  It's also the object that people will actually eat cereal on.  I threw my father the bowl on his head, the haircut thing.  Bye. 
[02:59:00]  Hey, to change gears really fast, Steve from FoundryMusic.com.  Good old Martini Steve got an email.  He threw it in front of me.  Death of another morning show.  We are doing the golden ticket thing.  We're going to save four more shows from commercial radio.  We already saved the first one, Ron and Fez.  They start September 12th right here on this channel.  They're ripping me off, Robin.  To all, this was written to Steve.  To all, this is the final break from the mixed morning Madhouse, which aired every Monday through Friday on KMDX.  San Angelo, Texas. 
[02:59:30]  Market 247.  I was actually the second host on the show, but quit after getting XM and hearing the show.  Hell, I was actually doing nearly the same thing you guys put together every day.  You stay out of market, 247.  I freaking hate regular commercial radio, so there you go.  My best bud, Jay, picked up the hosting duties of the show after I left and continued along with Hall of Fame and 54-year-old radio vet, Jack the Burrito Guy Aldridge. 
[03:00:00]  The Burrito Guy?  The Burrito Guy.  Right?  Jack the Burrito Guy is still around?  Jack is 74, Jimmy, and decided to retire.  Oh, he also owns the radio station, by the way.  The station has been handed down to the kids and grandkids to ruin, to run, I mean.  So the first move, let Grandpa retire from air duty and bring in Dallas' Kid Craddock in the morning via satellite.  So with explicit instructions from some of your redneck pests, the famous sign-off. 
[03:00:30]  Have fun with it.  So our famous sign-off, Anthony.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  So this very obscure show in the middle of nowhere, Texas, decided to end their last show with your mom's box in honor of you and I.  And I played for...  Okay, here it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's it.  The Madhouse is dark.  And Jack, it's been a privilege, buddy.  I love you like a dad.  It's been a pleasure.  I love you like a son.  A stepson.  Close enough, right? 
[03:01:00]  Any final words for everybody?  You always keep your words soft and sweet because you never know when you're going to have to eat them.  There you go.  9.57.  Good morning and goodbye.  Playing only the best variety from the 80s, 90s, and today.  Mix 106.  Wait, you didn't think I'd let Jack have the worst word, did you?  Yeah.  Your mom's box.  How about that?  9.58.  Appropriate song.  In the end, Linkin Park.  Goodbye from the Madhouse.  You blew it!  Are you still intros the next song? 
[03:01:30]  The intro the next...  No, it's...  You just got fired on commercial radio, you say your mom's box, and then you'd be a good  guy and intro the next song?  But coming up, Linkin Park?  How about...  You're supposed to just end on your mom's box.  How about this?  Hey, thanks a lot for a long run.  Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt.  Of course.  Go out in a blaze of glory.  Your mom's box and then he intros the last song.  And then he goes off and intros the song.  Well, he meant well.  I guess.  He's a good boy. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  Well, that's kind of cool.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll continue with Drew Curtis.  What?  What happened?  What?  What is that?  The Superdome, or is that a hotel?  Superdome was built to withstand 200 mile per hour wind.  Oh, my ass.  Is that a hotel?  I don't know what the hell is.  There's actually footage here.  There's a new breaking story.  They said that certain windows left open will cause curtains to be blown askew. 
[03:02:30]  With live footage.  Oh, I like that.  Is that a hotel?  Oh, look at this.  Please, God, let something fly into him.  A big branch, just a big branch impaling him would be the best thing to see on Fox News.  Oh, this guy's leaning into the wind.  That classic shot.  That's great.  I know that in these events, being near the beach is maybe not so frightening because,  as you say, you're just going to get rain and wind and maybe some sand coming in off  the ocean. 
[03:03:00]  But you've got some buildings, I guess, to the east of you, huh?  John, that's where some of this debris is coming from?  All right.  The only building we've got right here is the hotel.  And a good chunk of debris has already flown off that hotel.  Otherwise, it's a wide open parking lot.  Please blow away.  Come on, ball.  There's got to be a boat flagging around there somewhere.  He would roll like a ball of fire ants down the, into the woods.  They're coming in with these silly looking goggles, too.  You're kind of blind. 
[03:03:30]  They are silly.  Yeah, well, definitely necessary on this one.  Hey, Steve, what time did most people get out of Gulfport?  You know, when did most people get out?  I don't know.  An hour ago?  Emergency officials reporting a levy break in New Orleans.  A levy break.  When the levy breaks, we all know what happens.  That's right.  I so want that reported, Ted.  I so want.  If you want to have balls, stand outside like an aluminum siding place.  Yeah.  Or something that's going to be blown apart quickly. 
[03:04:00]  Stop huddling.  Massive flooding expected in the next few hours.  This guy's hiding behind a brick wall here.  Send these brave weather reporters to Iraq to do weather reports.  Yeah.  And go downtown.  Those animals trying to blow you up at every turn.  All right, well.  Two shelters closed due to flooding concerns.  It's not flooding, but I'm kind of concerned.  I'm a little worried about it.  It's obviously a big deal, but...  Is this song still going on?  Probably.  I don't know.  Let's take a listen.  Let me see.  I have to do this. 
[03:04:30]  No.  I have to do this.  Sweetie.  Mississippi levy breaks.  The church bells are broken.  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's still going?  What's up with the church bells?  I got to look that up.  The church bells broke, Opie.  It happens.  The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.  Oh, okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We know this stuff.  But not a word was spoken.  The church bells was all were broken.  Wow.  The plain-headed church.  It could be that the broken bells are the dead musicians. 
[03:05:00]  Neither can produce any more music.  It could be.  And the three men I admire the most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost, Holly, the Big Bopper, and Valens.  Or, it could be Hank Williams, Presley, and Holly.  Or, it could be JFK, Martin Luther King, and Bobby Kennedy.  Or, the Catholic aspects of the deity.  McLean had attended several Catholic schools.  Oh, you know who else it could be?  I think that's what it is. 
[03:05:30]  I'm going with that.  I'm going to drive a Chevy to that.  It's not the last train from the coast.  I guess they learned about flying from watch the old Big Bopper.  You want to fly?  Nah.  Catch a train from the coast.  Who was the guy that missed the plane?  Was it Waylon Jennings?  Was it Waylon?  Waylon.  Waylon Jennings?  I think it was.  Yeah, I think it was.  No, I think it was Johnny Cash. 
[03:06:00]  No?  No, it was...  Oh, God damn it, Jimmy.  Why don't you be shy?  Holy fuck, man.  Why are you so shy?  God, shy.  Holy shit.  That's a category five fart.  It started out as a one, but it improved.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a meaty one, all right.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. Live.  Hi, this is the fuck you to watch back.  Um, you guys call in. 
[03:06:30]  You guys aren't funny.  Stop.  You're taking the show down.  You don't fuck.  Have a good day.  Yeah, this is to the two guys that mugged my brother last night.  Fuck you.  I hope you fucking rot in jail, you dickhead.  Yeah, I want to send a big fuck you to pervertedjustice.com.  Here I am with his erection feeling silly.  Douchebag, fuck you, you fucking moron.  Shut the fuck up.  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Fuck you.  Fuck you, you fucking douchebag.  Shut the fuck up.  Eat a dick up.  See ya.  Hey, man, I just learned something from Howard Stern that Baba Booey is another word for fuck 
[03:07:00]  you, Howard Stern.  That's what the translation of Baba Booey means in the deep south here in Louisiana.  It means, by who taught me, fuck you, Howard Stern.  Yeah, I just want to send out an F.U. to the people at pervertedjustice.com for ruining  all the message boards for little Jimmy.  Yeah, Dirk and Hoboken just want to say fuck you, Opie.  Learn how to say classic.  It's not classic.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big F.U. to those two African-American gentlemen who tried to 
[03:07:30]  break into my truck.  I forgot my keys in an Office Max in Philly, and they told the cashier, I'll take the key  out to the gentleman.  And they were sitting there waiting.  They saw me trying to get into my truck.  They realized I couldn't find my keys.  They were waiting for me to go back inside to look for my keys so they could rob me.  Fuck you! 
[03:08:00]  Fuck all y'all!  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.  All right, in studio, Drew Curtis from Fark.com. 
[03:08:30]  A definite friend, F-A-R-K.com, if you haven't checked it out yet.  It's a great website.  Don Vito and Ryan Dunn from Viva La Bam in studio, any moment.  Really?  Don Vito?  Don Vito, yeah.  He's a fucking mess.  I've heard that he's...  That guy is a mess.  What happened?  Wow.  Yeah, I've also heard he might be a fan of the show. 
[03:09:00]  Really?  Yeah, we'll find out, I guess.  Don Vito.  Dirty Joe, what's up, Dirty Joe?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, Fox News is now reporting that homes in New Orleans are flooded to the ceiling.  To the ceiling?  To the ceilings.  Wow.  How they would know that, I don't know.  I guess they drowned.  I was, sorry, I was going to the TV audio because they were doing one of their dramatic promos. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, yes.  Fox News said homes in New Orleans are flooded to the ceiling.  Are there any 30-foot floods going on in there?  Buildings up to the third floor?  Water?  That's what I'm waiting to see.  That's what I heard.  That's what I was promised.  God, it really stinks in here now.  Jimmy, holy crap.  What?  Jimmy, you have just fouled the air in here.  You know what happened?  I was watching the storm footage.  Yeah?  And you got scared, we know.  No.  What?  What? 
[03:10:00]  No, I'm not going to tell you.  You're the worst.  Drew, what else you got before?  Egg whites come right out of his ass.  It's awful.  What else you got before we got to move on with Don Vito and Ryan Dunn?  In non-hurricane news, a book publisher in Britain has just released the annual list of  the hundred most vulgar, unintentionally vulgar city names in the entire country.  Unintentionally vulgar city names.  That's right. 
[03:10:30]  Either because they were words that are now out of use or whatnot that just sound rude.  A couple of them at the top 100.  Number 80, we have Cum Loden Court.  Cum Lode?  Cum Loden Court.  Uh-huh.  Cum Loden Court.  There's a...  Also, there's apparently a Dick's Mount in Suffolk.  There's a Crapstone in Devon.  Dick's Mount and Crapstone?  There's my favorite, Friars Entry.  Hmm?  Uh, we have Titty Ho, North Hampshire.  Get out of here.  Serious.  Titty Ho. 
[03:11:00]  Merkins Avenue.  Hmm.  Swallow Passage.  Spanker Lane.  And, uh, Lick Fold.  Then, uh, coming in number 14, we have Cock Chute Close.  Number nine, we have Shitterton Dorset.  Shitterton.  Shitterton.  Then, right behind that, Fingering Ho, Essex.  Is this on Fark, by the way?  Yes, it is.  Yeah, it's queued up to go.  Uh, and then in the, uh, top, uh, six, uh, a couple of them, the problem is, is that they  have different, uh, swear words in England.  Some of them don't make any sense.  We have Muff, North Ireland. 
[03:11:30]  Sandy Balls, Hampshire.  Uh, and then number two, Minge Lane.  What's that?  Minge?  Minge?  What's Minge?  Uh, um...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's better to look it up online.  Minge?  Why not?  What is Minge?  Check out the Urban Dictionary out there.  It's like, basically, it's like the, uh, uh, uh, stuff coming off of the...  What?  I keep forgetting I'm not on satellite radio.  Basically, it's like the, the, the...  If I remember right, it's this fluid coming off of a vagina.  Oh, that's Minge?  I think so.  Maybe it's a British term.  Yeah, it probably is.  Yeah, but number one, we got Cox Cornwall, which is great. 
[03:12:00]  I can't imagine they have street signs that stay around there too long.  Cox Cornwall.  Cox.  I live in Cox.  And that's not COX.  Well, that would be silly.  Yeah, it would.  Also, uh, in Britain, uh, a, a Northampton, Northamptonshire secondary school principal is now  allowing the use of the F word five times per student per day.  Ooh.  See, I thought they were going to be, like, really bad names that, like, definitely couldn't  use.  Like? 
[03:12:30]  Kick a cunt, South Dakota.  I've been there.  You're using that word a lot today, Jimmy.  Kick?  Are you all right?  Back from vacation.  Kick a cunt.  In, uh, in Russia, uh, the new, uh, stylish fad is to modify the, uh, the Volga, which  is their little boxy car that they used to have during Soviet times eras.  And you can see a picture right here.  I'll pass it over to you real quick.  You can see they're installing fins and, uh, spoilers and stuff like that, much like the  ricer kids do around here. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Uh, basically the reason they're doing it is because, uh, if you're somebody with money  and prestige in Moscow, you can't drive a car that wasn't made there.  So, instead, they take these $300 per automobile cars and then they just basically bling them  out.  You can see they've got the lowrider wheels and...  Bling them out.  Yep.  Hey, uh, I gotta interrupt this a little bit because we've got a website.  Oh, of course, foxnews.com.  Uh, let's see.  They've got their latest headlines, okay? 
[03:13:30]  Hurricane Katrina, obviously.  Uh, Superdome roof leaking.  We know that one.  The next one.  Big Easy to Become Atlantis.  Question mark?  Yes.  Uh, insurance costs may hit $25 billion.  That could affect all of us people.  Yes.  That's right.  That'll get you in your pocketbooks.  Mm-hmm.  And they know that now somehow.  Well, what's that little town right outside of Biloxi?  Uh, fucking baby Mississippi?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[03:14:00]  Let's go to the Bronx.  The Bronx.  Andy.  Yeah.  What's up?  Yeah, I just wanted to let Drew know that minge is actually slang for pussy.  I grew up in, uh, in Ireland, and we used the same slang for it.  It's pussy.  There's my confusion.  I lived in England for a year, and they used that term all the time, but they never said  what it was.  All right.  I'm telling you.  And, uh, another one, uh, we call, we call, um, pussy fanny, too.  You guys refer to it for us.  Yep.  We refer to it for pussy.  Oh, that's why they laugh at fanny pack.  Like, you can't say fanny pack. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, yeah.  A fanny.  Fanny.  Who would use that word anyway?  Thank you, sir.  Your breath smells like fanny juice.  It stinks.  All right.  I got a fucking gig coming up, by the way.  I hate the plug, but I'm doing, it's, it's, it's in Massachusetts.  It's a little town called Mouthful of Shit, and it's right outside of Boston.  Looking forward to it.  I'll be there.  All right.  Anything else there, Drew?  Well, our final kicker is, uh, there has been, uh, you guys may have seen, have you guys 
[03:15:00]  heard of the Flying Spaghetti Monster?  Yes.  Have you been seeing that?  Uh, the New York Times ran an article on the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  You have not, Jimmy.  I have.  You have not heard about the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  It's a, um, it's a, uh, it's a tall, thin monster, and he is defeated by water.  I'm like, fire ants.  What the hell?  The Flying Spaghetti Monster, actually, is something that we found on FARC about a month and a half  ago.  It was becoming one of those internet breakaway things.  Essentially, it was a guy who created a Flying Spaghetti Monster, and we have a little picture 
[03:15:30]  of him here.  You can see here he's in the, uh, the famous picture of my Michelangelo talking to Adam.  And, uh, and, uh, where this came from was there was a guy who was upset by the, uh,  intelligent design, uh, theory that was added to Kansas School Books recently, and for those  people who don't know what that is, that's basically, they've just added to science textbooks  they required to teach that God created the universe, or a God.  And, uh, Drew?  Yes?  This had better go.  I know, it does. 
[03:16:00]  It doesn't want to get there.  Because I got instant feedback here.  I know.  And I'm going to refresh that page.  And, uh, we'll see what they say.  Check it out.  Sounds good.  And Anthony will read every single one of them.  There you go.  There's a guy right now sending in feedback from Raper Retard, Pennsylvania.  But anyway, the Giant Spaghetti Monster is a made-up God, obviously.  But the guy that came up with it has decided to file a petition with the Kansas School Board of Education  to get Flying Spaghetti Monster-ism taught alongside creationism in the science textbooks.  As a legitimate. 
[03:16:30]  As a legitimate religion.  Because, as he says, there is no more proof that God created the universe than there is  that there's a giant Flying Spaghetti Monster watching over all of us.  All right.  So he's saying that he thinks that if they're going to teach religion, they should teach that.  Yes.  Okay.  Exactly.  Because there's just as much proof for it.  And you decided to go with that story as opposed to coffee are healthier than fruits and vegetables?  Well, we already knew that coffee was healthier than fruits and vegetables,  according to some pasty white guy in a closet somewhere. 
[03:17:00]  That's exactly what it says.  Yep.  I would have gone with nerd conquers social anxiety by turning his life into RPG.  Very good.  Well, Drew, it's always good to have you.  I love FARC.  Go there every day.  And check it out.  FARC.com.  Drew Curtis, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, guys.  Thank you, sweetie.  Thank you.  I've got a quickie here.  Audio fantasy for Jim Norton.  What's this about?  Where's Steve?  I have no idea. 
[03:17:30]  Get Steve in here.  Jennifer in Seattle has a crush on you.  Oh.  Oh, I heard about this.  And she sent some audio.  Okay.  An audio fantasy about Jim Norton.  Steve, what's this Jennifer in Seattle thing?  It's a young lady in...  No.  Oh.  Did you get him?  Oh, he certainly did.  He walked all the way back there.  He got you.  Look at him.  You are the worst, Jimmy.  God.  That's a little trick I picked up in Severed Clit, Iowa.  Some concerns because water is raining down near lights. 
[03:18:00]  What?  At the Superdome.  Oh.  So.  It's a mess.  Power out.  Homes flooded to the ceilings.  Hopefully, Shepard Smith is dead.  All right.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve.  Jennifer is a young lady in Seattle who...  Take those sunglasses off your head, please.  They're enraging me.  You're not enraged.  You're not enraged.  You're not enraged.  It's a good look if you're a director in 1940. 
[03:18:30]  No one wears sunglasses on top of their heads.  He's trying to cover up that razor mess.  What happened?  Yeah, that's true.  Which razor mess?  It seems all...  It's growing.  Yeah, probably it's growing in all choppy.  Yeah, it is.  Who cut your hair?  Three Mile Island?  That's why you're wearing the shades.  To cover up a world of hurt up there.  No, I stopped wearing the backwards baseball cap today.  Were you with the JetBlue Terminal holding Anthony's hand?  Are you funny?  What?  Radiation emanating from me. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, it's great.  All right.  That haircut should come with...  I stopped.  Thank you.  All right, what?  What's this?  Jennifer in Seattle is a young lady who has a crush on Jimmy,  and she sent in a little audio piece describing a fantasy she has  where she'd like to get Jimmy and another woman alone in bed.  I've never seen a fucking crew cut done more horribly.  How could it not be?  How could it be done horribly?  I shaved myself bald, and this is... 
[03:19:30]  I'll tell you how.  I'll tell you how.  You fucking uneven follicle motherfucker.  When I crew cut, I go...  I go down all the way, and it's like every hair is the same length.  You have...  Yours is a bevy of lengths.  And I just want to...  I want to fucking...  You've got a baseball field up there.  You know what I'm going to do?  I want to...  You've got to feel the dreams in the middle of your head.  I want to tie a Bic razor to a hammer and fucking give you a good shaving. 
[03:20:00]  What the hell?  That's awfully mean.  But I don't understand.  How could you not like it?  I shaved it bald, so this is all growing in as a result of all being nothing.  You know?  All right.  Well, just because you cut the grass, it doesn't mean that weeds aren't going to pop up.  That looks horrendous.  He knows.  That's why he's been wearing the glasses all the time.  Exactly.  Stop trying to hide it with little things.  A yarmulke and a pair of glasses.  Just stick on a fucking hat.  All right.  Tomorrow I'll wear a hat just for you, Jimmy. 
[03:20:30]  That fucking haircut should come with a bedpan.  Steve, don't encourage him.  I told you.  It's about me this time.  Don't fire the scene.  Don't encourage him.  That is awful.  All right.  So we got...  Jesus Christ.  What?  I can't get over how uneven and messy that is.  I've never seen a messy crew cut before.  I'm looking at one right now.  Steve.  Yes.  That was hurtful.  Yeah.  Okay.  Fine.  Why do you make it real?  Sorry. 
[03:21:00]  All right.  So this is audio of Jennifer talking about the fantasy she has...  Well, that's...  What?  What?  It's a fantasy.  She must have a threesome with Jimmy.  She's in Seattle.  She's actually right outside of Seattle in a little town called Smelly Kids Asshole Maine.  Maine?  Did you say Maine at the end of that?  Yeah.  In Seattle?  Yeah.  It's a big town.  I should have said Washington.  Oh, dear Lord.  Yes. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, dear Lord, indeed.  Washington.  Here's the audio of Jennifer's fantasy about Jim Norton.  I wanted to tell you about this fantasy that I've been having involving Norton and this  other woman.  I'm not quite sure how we get into this position, but my fantasy is there's a woman eating my  pussy and that Norton's behind her watching us, and you're asking me if it's good, and  I'm telling you it could be better, and you're telling her how to change her technique, speed  up, slow down, move her face back and forth, and she's listening to you because she wants 
[03:22:00]  you to fuck her really bad.  Annoying director.  She's about to get up in the air, so you've got a great view of her pussy and her ass,  and that's exactly how you like it.  And I'll say one thing.  If she wanted me to fuck her really bad, I can certainly accommodate.  That's the only way I'd do it.  Really bad.  More.  I like how she's...  A hundred windows blown out in Hyatt Regency in New Orleans.  That's going to cause some damage. 
[03:22:30]  Let's hear more.  And I'm on my back, legs spread, looking up at you over her head.  And I'm watching you, watching her, going down on me.  But the thing is, you can't fuck her until she makes me come.  And Jim, she wants it really badly.  As badly as I want my orgasm.  So she's licking my pussy as she listens to you tell her how to do it.  And I'm telling you what I want, and you're telling her what to do.  Saying things like, if you want me to fuck you, you better make her come.  And she's licking and moaning, and moving her pussy and her ass towards you. 
[03:23:00]  And she wants you really badly, and I'm really close to coming.  Why am I so bossy in this?  Yeah.  I'm usually a good egg.  You're nasty.  This is good, though.  She's really dirty, this chick.  I like it.  Really dirty.  It's filthy.  Yeah.  There's a reason she's on her back.  Why?  Oink, oink.  Why?  Where's the picture?  I'm just thinking.  Oh.  What are you doing? 
[03:23:30]  Ah!  That one is going to be horrific.  I like this fantasy.  I'd like to hear more.  That one's going to be horrific.  You are so nasty.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  And I tell you, and I'm going to come, and I ask you if you want to fuck her.  And you say yes, in that sexy tone that you get, and she starts, you know, I start my  orgasm. 
[03:24:00]  And as I'm coming, I say, fuck her, Jim, fuck her hard, and you thrust into her, deep and  hard, and it's wet, and it's tight, and it's good.  And she finishes making me come as you bury your dick into her, and she wants it so badly  by that point that she's leaning back to meet your thrust, and I get to watch you fuck  her as you tell me how good it feels.  And that's what I came to today.  Yeah, that's awesome.  Very nice.  Wow.  What a filthy, filthy girl.  I fucking filled up a little on that. 
[03:24:30]  Very sexy.  She's got to call the show.  That's really hot.  She might be listening to this in replay, so call us, like, tomorrow or something.  All right.  Boats going into buildings in Mississippi.  Really?  Boats into buildings.  Shepard's always...  I hope Shep, uh...  Shepard's always good for some honest reporting.  Let's see what's going on.  ...stories tall, yet they act as that same sort of wind tunnel, and these hurricane shutters  constantly flapping, and then glass windows breaking, and glass flying down the street,  pieces of rooftops coming off, metal peeling off, and that's sailing down the street. 
[03:25:00]  Though it's not constant and unending, it's noises which are not familiar, and the echoing  through these canyons is somewhat frightening.  It's a different kind of hurricane experience, and I'm sure one they hope they don't see here  any time soon again.  Yeah, we've been able to hear some of those noises being on the phone live with you.  Shepard Smith, we will be checking back again, French Quarter, there in New Orleans.  We're going to get to Jonathan Sarri in just a moment, but as we continue to look at this 
[03:25:30]  satellite loop of the hurricane as it plows into the New Orleans area, the right-hand quadrant  of the right-hand upper quadrant of the street...  All right.  Ah.  Oh.  This just in.  Don Vito and Ryan Dunn from Viva La Bam will be in studio next week.  Unbelievable.  Why?  They went down to the VMAs and have never made it to New York, so they're still down there. 
[03:26:00]  We...  Stink.  Just stink with our guest getting.  We cannot get guests.  Why not a phone call?  Because, see, that makes for a good story for talk radio.  Wow.  They didn't make it because they stayed in Miami.  All right, let's get them on the phone.  What happened?  Wow, we were having a good time.  We were partying.  We missed our flight.  And it at least makes for good radio.  And then we can promote and go, hey, well, that's cool.  We'll see you next week.  Good luck to you. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  That's how radio works.  Got to go with the flow.  But instead, we just get a note handed to us.  We get nothing.  We get nothing out of it.  They couldn't let us know earlier.  See, you could create stories.  How did the show go so fast today?  What time is it, Angel Face?  It's 22.  I like that you knew I met you.  Wow.  Oh, wait.  We're getting some wind.  Oh, the wind meter guy?  Take a look over here.  This condominium complex over here, right behind it is the Gulf of Mexico. 
[03:27:00]  Well, if you look through that bottom parking garage right there, the visibility is so horrible.  You can barely see anything.  But every once in a while, you'll see a huge wave with the spray from that wave reaching above the parking garage.  And understand this parking garage probably goes up about 15 feet.  And the beach itself is probably about 20 feet below that.  You know what else I can see?  The fucking pavement, stupid.  There's no flooding.  Another concern is the storm surge.  Right now, we're experiencing a storm surge of 16 feet above normal levels. 
[03:27:30]  That is causing flooding in several areas of the island.  There's nothing in that parking garage.  What an asshole.  He's causing flooding.  He's right next to the water.  And he's high and dry.  And the parking lot looks pretty dry.  A plastic storage container just came blowing into this parking lot about half an hour ago.  There's water and debris that's being ripped off the roofs of these high-rise hotels.  The buildings themselves are very strong and stand up quite well in these parking lots.  Well, I thought they were going to be destroyed.  What happened?  On the roofs that are not quite as strong that are being ripped off. 
[03:28:00]  And so we're having a plastic metallic and pieces of drywall blowing around here.  So anyone standing out in the path of the wind is in jeopardy.  And any vehicles or any other property in the way can potentially be damaged.  But look at this parking lot outside the hotel.  This is in the direct path of the wind.  You can see how hard it's blowing the trees here.  And understand, we are not experiencing the worst of the storm yet. 
[03:28:30]  We're not experiencing anything.  How come it blows a tree in half and a guy can just stand there?  Ooh, good question.  Who the fuck does that happen?  Trees are all bent over and this tool is just yapping.  Let's go to another channel, Eric.  I don't like this guy.  I don't either hope.  Try CNN.  CNN.  You can see the tremendous amount of flooding.  White caps in the parking lot.  The wind ripping that water across the area.  Where's the white caps in the parking lot?  Oh, stop it.  The telephone poles, waddling in the breeze.  Also, these steel light poles. 
[03:29:00]  I tell you, they just look to me like they just want to topple over and snap.  Is that what they look like to you, stupid?  They want to.  They're not.  You can also see the rain just coming down.  The rain is moving down.  The other guy has nothing.  That parking lot.  I'm showing a parking lot that's flooded like you get in your town during any heavy rainstorm.  It's not even halfway up the tires.  The awning, which we were under a short time ago.  Did it fall?  The wind has damaged that now.  Roof tiles ripped off.  Flashing.  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  A couple of shingles missing.  Oh, God.  That's desperate.  The wind continues to pound.  What we're seeing now.  Oh, his gutter is moving.  Is that it looks like the winds are starting to turn more southeasterly.  A more southerly component.  Which tells me that the center of the storm is getting a little bit closer to us and a little bit to our west.  So, I'm guessing we're not going to see the eye itself.  But the right front quadrant of that eye wall, which is what we're seeing right now, is obviously extremely dangerous, Darren. 
[03:30:00]  And this is the strongest wind we've seen so far.  Don't you wish that comfort and sound would blow off and sever his head?  I'm glad you and the crew took refuge inside.  We will continue to check back with you.  To breaking news and updated information, the 11 a.m. update coming in a little bit early.  Our Chad Myers has that.  Oh, Chad's got the 11 a.m. update.  125 miles per hour now, Darren.  Yeah, still very, very, very fast.  Very dangerous here.  And the funny part is what we're seeing from Rob is really the easiest part that he is going to see for quite some time. 
[03:30:30]  I'm going to zoom into Biloxi where he is.  Here's Gulfport just getting the worst of it right now.  Bay St. Louis, you are now in the eye itself.  Don't look outside to see it.  Stay inside because you have the other side still to come.  But here is Biloxi.  Rob is right there in the light blue.  And then all of a sudden, literally, I want to keep that camera on as long as we can keep it on.  Because look at what's coming his way.  This is the eastern part of the eye wall.  That eye wall running over the barrier islands right into Biloxi. 
[03:31:00]  And it is going to get very, very strong.  We have another radar that we can actually show you, too, to give you a different area, a different view.  This is called the Viper radar.  Just from a different little perspective here, from Bay St. Louis over to Gulfport.  That's where Gary Tuchman is.  That's where the weather is very bad there.  He just tried to call us and said, man, does it get better from here?  Not for a while, Gary.  That weather is going to be moving quickly.  If you get better from here, he goes over to the conversation he has.  They have nothing.  If you get better from here, not for a while, Gary.  And he said, how long?  I said, I'm not sure, Gary. 
[03:31:30]  I don't like him either.  He's awful.  Let's go somewhere else.  You know what really stinks?  The weather channel.  You go to the car show every two seconds.  Just because this number three now is popping out on our map, Randy and Amy, it does not lessen the impact of this storm.  This is still packing gusts to 155 miles an hour.  Now it's Category 3.  This is a little bit of good news.  That means the more forward momentum it picks up, the less amount of rain will fall in the same exact area. 
[03:32:00]  So, once again, the wind fields are breaking news.  That's Jimmy.  Why all the farts today?  Isolated tornadoes.  Happy to be back.  Danny, it's that right front quadrant, right where Biloxi is situated, right there.  All right.  Well.  Okay.  It's over.  Nothing really happened.  Don't blow it toward me. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, he stinks.  I missed you guys for a week.  You are so...  Oh.  No.  What?  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  I know.  He sprayed too much.  You know.  He's not talking about the Lysol.  When are you going back on your diet?  I'm on my diet.  What were you eating on vacation?  You ate crazy over vacation.  I had some good food.  Rancid pork.  Dude, I don't like being challenged like this.  Holy crap. 
[03:33:00]  All right.  Dude, no joke.  That one's brutal.  All right.  You dare me?  No.  No.  All right.  To make that worse, you would have to shit yourself.  All right.  I dare you.  He dared me.  I can't take this.  You know what?  I'm going to eat a whole thing of grapes during tomorrow's show.  I'm going to smell them.  I'm going to eat a whole thing of grapes tomorrow.  And then make dumb Eric just sit there the whole show and scroll.  Why am I being punished?  I will not punish him. 
[03:33:30]  I'm going to spread all of Eric's mayonnaise on my grapes, and I'm going to eat them tomorrow morning.  What do you think of Jimmy, Jimmy?  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Yes.  That's right.  All right.  We have another guy.  He's in Central Park.  What does this have to do with the story?  What?  Oh, is there another Central Park?  We're gusting into tropical storm-force winds, so you can only imagine.  I heard Jim Cantore and Simon Temperton talking about what they're dealing with.  And so this is what our picture looks like.  Just imagine what their picture looks like.  Just terrible destruction going on right now in Gulfport, Mississippi. 
[03:34:00]  We're actually standing on a sand dune.  That is a couple of little waves.  That's protecting us from the Gulf of Mexico here.  And imagine the brunt of that Category 4 and what that water would be like rushing all the way up here.  Of course, it would take out the sand dunes, and we would see...  Where is the floor now?  Any place with water now?  Yeah.  I'm standing here in a tub.  Imagine if this was outdoors in the middle of the right.  The storm prospects are four here in Van Roo, Chad.  What you're seeing now, obviously, you knew it.  You've been in enough of these.  An outer eye band, an outer feeder band.  The storm is still circulating around you, well to your east. 
[03:34:30]  But this is a storm, a band of storms just coming right down the Mississippi River.  Go back to the radar here, then we'll get back to Anderson in a second.  That radar is showing the very heavy band just to the west now of Baton Rouge.  There it is.  There's the line.  That's the cell that Anderson is in.  Quickly, though, he would be in nothing.  And then again, 45 minutes later, another band going to hit him again.  Be careful out there.  New Orleans is like past it now.  Be careful.  It's past New Orleans.  Nothing. 
[03:35:00]  I don't know if you can see.  We're trying to work it with the camera.  This crane is just swinging and occasionally hitting this pier that we're on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, hit his head.  It was about 10 or 15 feet to the west of me before, but now it's swinging around.  I mean, this crane could very easily just swing along and hit all parts of this pier.  Could easily.  Chad, you said, you know, as you said, we're in one of these.  It won't.  Exactly.  It'll soon calm down.  It'll pick up again.  I mean, how much longer does this thing go on here?  Why are they talking about all these dangers that will never affect us?  Or that could happen. 
[03:35:30]  Like there's going to be a person that just happens to be out there now and the crane's  going to hit him?  We have the category four wins coming out of Jimmy Norton's ass.  It's very dangerous.  Stop.  You know what it was?  I just missed you guys on the vacation.  And in a way, that's my way of saying it's good to see you.  Welcome.  It's like an animal marking his territory.  It might not be pleasant, but it's sincere.  All right, let's say hi to Ray in Cape Cod.  Ray?  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  Hey.  Hey, you guys know if anyone's taking cover underneath a Sirius satellite radio?  They're afraid it'll blow over on them and kill them.  I guess they just announced they have a portable unit, but you have to plug it in to get live  programming.  Thanks, guys.  I'm checking out.  Did you guys hear about that one?  Oh, dude.  It would.  They got a portable unit.  You know, XM has the nice MiFi and now the Tau and the Panasonic unit, and we're going  to have other ones coming out in the very near future. 
[03:36:30]  And it's a true portable satellite unit that XM has.  You go out.  You can pick up the broadcasts that are coming in from XM.  Yes, live.  Live.  Now, the Sirius unit, they bullshit so bad in their press release for this thing that  they were trying so hard to cover up the point that you cannot listen to live programming  with this unit.  You have to dock it in your car or your house, and then you can record the programming and 
[03:37:00]  take it with you and listen to recorded programming.  So it's actually, you're able to, if you can plug it in, you can listen to it live.  So it's really a portable unit if you have a fucking mobile home.  Right.  That's it.  Dog shit.  Or a very long cord.  The way they worded this thing is now you can take Sirius wherever you want to go.  You decide what and when you want to hear.  And it said you dock it in the home or car docking system, but really trying to evade the 
[03:37:30]  whole point that you can't listen to Sirius programming live on this unit.  So basically, that's cool that Sirius is now an iPod.  That's very convenient.  That's pretty much what it is.  So why pick your own music?  Just download their shit.  The difference with XM is you can listen to talk radio and news live.  What are you going to do?  Fucking download news and listen to it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Download the hurricane coverage and listen to it on Tuesday.  Yeah.  Listen to it tomorrow.  Yeah.  Fox News.  Get it live.  How about you want to listen to Fox News? 
[03:38:00]  You're walking around.  You got a MiFi.  You tune in Fox News.  And you listen.  I'm going to download some stuff from Friday and listen to it.  Absolutely.  It's in excess.  Weather for New Orleans.  Sunny today.  That's what you'd get on the Sirius tape recorder, as Jimmy once called it.  Dave, congratulations, Sirius.  You've invented the tape recorder.  Yeah, that's great.  Cool.  We're getting that sharp image ad, I hope.  All right.  What else did we make? 
[03:38:30]  I have a recording here that I think you should hear.  What is that?  It's a teaser for later shows.  It's good.  All right.  Let's hear it.  It's only, sorry.  It's only like 25 seconds.  Just a phone message I got.  Ooh.  Let's listen.  All right.  I like when Jimmy brings things.  Hold on.  Just queuing up.  Attaboy, Hope.  Way to chime in.  You don't get full credit because you do it into the side of the microphone. 
[03:39:00]  No, no, look, look.  You got one?  No.  Here's me talking into the side of the microphone.  You hear the difference?  No, there was no one.  And now, and now, here's me talking into the front.  If you put the front right there, you would get better ones than you're getting.  No, they're just duds.  No, I actually lean over and cram the mic into my crack, and I actually will almost push my own back like I'm forcing myself to take it.  Jimmy takes the mic all the way up to the jack that plugs into the back of it and lets loose. 
[03:39:30]  Sometimes I have butt cheeks on console.  All right.  We have a tease?  This is for future shows.  All right.  Let's take a listen.  Jim, this is an emergency.  I'm being dragged into the police station because of this fucking cunt.  Please call me back.  I have a few specific questions.  Thanks.  That's who I dated for a year.  Wait.  That is your ex.  Yeah.  And I hear Jim, help me, what?  I'm being dragged into a police station. 
[03:40:00]  Because of this.  Yeah.  Jim, this is an emergency.  I'm being dragged into the police station because of this fucking cunt.  Please call me back.  I have a few specific questions.  Thanks.  I didn't talk to her yet, but she's having a problem with another girl, and there's been  like death threats, and apparently she was dragged into the police station.  So that's who I was...  Dragged?  For what?  I don't know yet, but that's...  Can we get her on the phone?  We never know the story.  Can we get her on the phone?  I'll find out as soon as I talk to her. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  That's...  To me, one of the things I was exaggerating, that I dated a fucking kook.  Lunatic.  Both of the impressive and the not so impressive in terms of choices that people are making today  in Baton Rouge.  Anderson, thank you.  We're back with you many, many times.  We're talking about a storm that is impacting at this very minute four different states along  the Gulf Coast.  We're going...  All right.  There is nothing.  Nope.  Nothing.  That's why we should have it.  But I'll go home and watch it for hours.  Of course.  We'll all be watching.  What do you point out, Hawk?  What?  What happened?  Hawk's doing some pointing.  What?  Oh, is it? 
[03:41:00]  Is that true?  Is that a confirmed story?  This just in, a Starbucks machine is being wheeled in.  What?  As we speak.  Right over there.  Where?  Yes.  We've got to thank the pests for getting that job done, too.  And that's something.  Are you kidding me?  We've got a Starbucks machine?  Look at how big it is.  And that was thanks to the pests, wasn't it?  Yeah, the pests, like we said earlier, they're infiltrating everything at this point.  Everything.  And Don and, they're MIA, so they're going to reschedule. 
[03:41:30]  No one can find them, so they went to the VMAs last night.  All right.  Well, that sucks.  That was our big thing today, our big interview.  Now we're just filling.  Well.  Well, we can do some what-do-we-learns.  Thank you to the pests for getting the Starbucks thing done.  Too bad they didn't do the ad for Sharp Rimage magazine.  What?  What happened?  I have to confirm it first, but I heard there was an XM ad in Sharp Rimage magazine.  Uh-huh.  With every show mentioned, really, MTV and Bob Edwards and baseball.  Uh-oh. 
[03:42:00]  No.  No.  Sharp Rimage.  Oh, that's not a big company, I don't think.  No.  And you know what?  People that probably go to Sharp Rimage wouldn't listen to this show anyway.  This is what happens when you call.  You go, hello, marketing.  Oh, you are Gary Gass today.  Wow.  I got a spray again.  I got a spray up the wall. 
[03:42:30]  Gass is on fire.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, boys.  Today I learned that Anthony is radioactive.  Yes.  Gally Dooley.  Yes.  Uh, from whackbag.com.  Today I learned that the Superdome is the serving bowl of a big old serving of...  Make your own joke there.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  Uh...  Guys, there are people on CNN trying to jump up in the air to see if they can fly, the reporter said.  The people needed a good dose...  The reporter said the people needed a good dose of common sense.  The reporters have some harsh comments.  Oh, God, Jimmy.  I'm so glad that one traveled.  Holy shit.  I was proud of that one.  Oh.  He's spraying a towel with a Lysol unbreathing. 
[03:43:30]  It's like when they bring in a cadaver that's been in the swamp for a month, and they got  to put the Vicks under their nose.  Oh.  Oh.  Brian.  I'm going to pull a moth out of your ass with some forceps.  Brian from...  No.  That was a good one.  The significance is change.  Wait a minute.  Brian from Krusty Jizzrag, New York.  Yeah, keep that bit going for us tomorrow, please.  I like that one.  Today I learned it's not worth wasting time with the mouth when you can be pushing stool. 
[03:44:00]  Let's see.  Rich, Rich, what did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  First day back from vacation.  I learned alligators do the best assault on the media.  It was an O and A party croc.  It was an O and A party croc.  Very funny.  All right.  Well.  Oh.  There you have it.  That's how we end today.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Program complete. </pre>
