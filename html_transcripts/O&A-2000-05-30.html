<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast of May 30th, 2000, began with the hosts returning from a long weekend, immediately launching into a discussion of Rick Lazio's recent fall at a Memorial Day parade, comparing it to past falls by Bob Dole and recounting their own injury-inducing "Bob Dole falling down contest" at the station.  They then shifted to their experience at the WBCN River Rave 2000, detailing their encounters with various bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Filter, and Godsmack, specifically mentioning interactions with Richard Patrick of Filter and Scott Weiland of STP, as well as meeting Stephanie McMahon.  A significant portion of the show was devoted to the Napster controversy, sparked by Metallica's actions against file-sharers. Callers debated the legality and ethics of Napster, with the hosts largely siding with the users and callers offering tips on bypassing Napster bans.  Richard Patrick of Filter and Gino called in to the show. The hosts also plugged their own CD, website, and sponsor, Priceline.

The next segment focused on listener feedback from their recent road show, which drew approximately 2200 attendees.  The hosts discussed a perceived curse word in a Kid Rock appearance on Raw, the unexpected success of their "WOW" merchandise, and a Stacker 2 sponsorship, accompanied by sexually suggestive comments about the commercial.  Numerous calls detailed outrageous incidents at the roadshow: a man knocking himself out falling into a foam pit during a performance featuring strippers and naked women, Spaz's unpleasant experience in an ice-filled dunk tank, and Madisonâ€™s on-stage use of a wiffle bat. Old Dirty provided a first-hand account.  The hosts mentioned photos and videos of the event, showcasing significant nudity, available online at WNEW.com and foundrymusic.com. Anthony's attire (sandals and shorts) also became a topic of conversation.  Additional calls recounted further humorous and outrageous happenings at the road show.  Uncensored footage from the event was mentioned as being available on an unofficial website.

A following segment detailed Anthony's negative experience at a *Mission Impossible 2* screening, focusing on disruptive behavior from Black and Hispanic moviegoers.  This led to a broader discussion about unruly theater patrons, with callers attributing the issue disproportionately to Black and Hispanic audiences and sharing various stories of disruptive behavior. Solutions, including electric shock devices and faking hearing impairment, were suggested.  Prior to this, listener calls discussed the road show; Chris described his setup work and disappointment at not receiving a sticker, and Steve inquired about the show's syndication in Boston.  The hosts also made offensive jokes about the Olsen twins' bodies.  Commercial breaks featured ads for The Diamond Exchange and Ranch 1 restaurants.

Anthony gave a brief, unenthusiastic review of *Mission Impossible 2*, focusing only on the masks, followed by a controversial statement about groups earning respect and a discussion of inter-group relations. The show then gave away tickets to a WWF event.  A large portion focused on a man hanging from a building; Gorilla Boy recounted difficulties developing explicit photos from the road show, and numerous callers confirmed the incident, speculating about the man's motives and debating whether to encourage him to jump.  Conflicting reports emerged about his fate, with eventual mention of deployed airbags.  Other topics included the New York Knicks' win, Dana Carvey's heart surgery complications, and Mike Tyson's alleged use of bedroom cameras, the latter leading to sexually suggestive and offensive jokes. The show ended with promotions for Rockaway Bedding, Red Hot Chili Peppers tickets, a "wow" sign contest, and a plan to encourage a woman to flash her breasts on live TV during a Devils hockey game.  The concluding "What Did We Learn Today?" segment featured listener calls, some containing offensive language and racial slurs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony, you're not a tack ass, you're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah!  Goddamn, we're back.  Alright, vacation's over.  That's it.  Taking a four day weekend, I apologize personally to our faithful listeners out there in Radioland.  Anthony, technically a five day weekend.  That wasn't work Thursday.  Yeah, that's true.  We have lots to cover today. 
[00:00:30]  We certainly do.  But just so you guys are convinced that we are live, yes, it's Tuesday, May 30th, baby.  Yeah.  And we are back.  Year 2000.  Year 2000, right.  Yeah, this could be a tape from last year.  Planet Earth.  Yeah.  People are starting to call, there we go.  You guys understand, right?  Right?  If you had the chance to take a four day weekend, wouldn't you?  Hey, look, look who it is.  It's Lazio. 
[00:01:00]  Look out.  Senator.  Yeah, leave the senator alone.  The polls are changing.  We're going to get Lazio in there after all, man.  That poor bastard, though, man.  Oh, every picture.  Him with his face on the pavement.  You know, we've all done that, though.  Yeah, but, you know.  I did that recently in Boston.  I was running down the sidewalk and all something happens with your feet and you fall in slow  motion. 
[00:01:30]  It takes you about 30 feet before you hit the pavement.  There he is.  That's the most embarrassing picture on the post, man.  It's him, like, with someone helping him up.  He looks all disheveled.  He split his lip wide open.  He's got a big, fat lip.  He needed stitches.  What did he get, like 15 stitches?  Yeah, Rick Lazio falling down at a Memorial Day parade in Babylon.  Yeah, he was too pretty anyway.  He slipped as he sprinted to catch up with other marchers.  He's wearing those, you know, those shoes.  He should be wearing sneakers or something. 
[00:02:00]  It's perfect, though.  You know, he's a pretty boy.  You've got to scamp him up a little bit so the average voter could vote for him.  It's funny, because now in the picture, he almost looks like Ray Boom Boom Mancini.  Yeah.  Doesn't he?  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  He looks like Boom Boom.  Yeah, a little bit.  His lip all cut up.  That's funny, though.  Remember when Dole took his fall?  Gee.  Do we have the Bob Dole falling contest?  Yeah, me and Opie did that.  We had a Bob Dole falling down contest when he fell to see who could make the best noise  falling into debris. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Bob Dole, you remember, he was on a podium.  He was like on a little stage area with a railing, and he went to lean against the railing  to shake someone's hand on the railing gateway.  Oops.  And he never even lost his pencil.  He still had that pencil in his hand or the pen.  Hey, it fell down.  He should have looked right into the camera and went,  live from New York.  It's Saturday night.  That would have gotten him some sympathy vote.  That could be pretty funny.  Well, Rick found the Bob Dole thing really fast here.  All right. 
[00:03:00]  Anne is first.  All right.  We did the Bob Dole falling down contest.  This is legit.  This goes back a couple years ago when Bob Dole fell.  Mm-hmm.  A couple years.  It's probably like three years ago now, huh?  Yeah.  We've been at the cutting edge of politicians falling down for years now.  Yeah.  So we got the whole staff to just bring in all the debris they could find laying around  the radio station.  Yeah.  And Ant and I decided to see who could fall down the best, and then we had the listeners  vote.  Mm-hmm.  So first up is you, Anthony.  Okay.  I'm just getting on the chair, man. 
[00:03:30]  I'm not getting on the console.  All right.  Anthony's going up on the chair.  You're a whip, because if you get on the console, you're a good eight feet off the ground, man.  I am staying on the chair.  I'm jumping into a pile of garbage.  I'm going to kill myself.  All right.  Fine.  Let's see your Bob Dole falling down invitation.  All right.  All right.  Hi, people.  It's Bob Dole.  Look, I want to meet my public.  Let me kiss some babies.  I'll get to the edge over here.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Yeah!  Oh, that's going to be hard to beat, bro. 
[00:04:00]  How do you feel?  I am.  I feel like Bob Dole.  That was awesome.  That hurt.  Remember that.  We have video of this somewhere.  We've got to get that on the unofficial website.  Yeah.  And this is my try at the same thing.  All right.  It's my turn.  Oh, God.  He's climbing up on the console.  All right, Anthony.  I'm eight feet off the ground, man.  Don't do it off the console.  You're going to hurt yourself.  Well, it's the Bob Dole contest.  It's radio.  Don't hurt yourself.  My fellow Americans, I just have to say to you, just don't. 
[00:04:30]  Are you all right, man?  No, man.  That hurt.  It's radio, you nut.  Dude, help me off the floor.  What are you insane?  Man.  What did you do?  Someone get this pen out of my nose.  Your hand is cut.  I know, man.  Well, you win.  I win.  You win, man.  By the way, what do I win?  Nothing.  We didn't even bet anything. 
[00:05:00]  Ow, my elbow.  I ended up spraining my elbow.  Yeah, I remember.  You cut yourself.  It was ridiculous.  Anyway.  Cool.  That's a Lazio fellow over the weekend.  Yeah.  I still think he's the man for the job.  Oh, without a doubt.  Anybody but that goddamn Hillary Clinton.  The polls are changing, Anthony.  Yes.  I think he's in the lead in some polls at this point, which is crazy.  Do you think the fall helped him or hurt him?  Ah, sympathy.  Yeah?  Yes.  And then he says, I was so happy to be back home, I kissed the ground. 
[00:05:30]  They've got to get those little funny little...  Put on pump.  Yeah, like when Reagan was shot, he was joking with the doctors.  Remember that?  Yes, well, I thought he missed me.  Yes.  What?  Hello?  Anything to get away from Nancy's big head.  Shoot me.  They always joke when they get back, but man, what a lip he's got on him now.  So.  Yeah.  It's funny.  We've all done it, though.  You're running and all of a sudden your legs just like you trip over one foot or something.  You're like, I'm going down and there's nothing I can do about it. 
[00:06:00]  Someone commenting on your voice in the old tapes, Opie.  Has your voice changed?  I think so.  Since you've been on the air, I finally reached puberty.  Yeah.  Was that it?  That's why I hate...  Hey, it's Opie!  That's why I hate playing the old tapes because I get abused every time.  You keep promising you're going to bring in some of the really old tapes.  There's no way...  Like Rochester and stuff.  There's no way I'm going to do it now.  No?  Because that's only a couple of years ago and you hear the...  Cookie-capa-cootie-too.  You hear the difference in the voice.  It's Opie.  Cookie-ca-ca-cootie-too.  I was more excited about doing radio back then so my voice was high. 
[00:06:30]  I guess so.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I'm trying to share an old bit with everybody and I get abused.  What?  I don't get that one.  Yeah.  I'll abuse myself.  What?  Hey, Opie.  I saw your picture in the new issue of WWF Raw Magazine.  Yeah.  That's a nice set of man boobs you have there. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my God.  I haven't seen the picture yet.  They have these places nowadays called gyms.  You should look into it.  You got to see this picture.  Look.  Look at me, right?  Okay.  Yeah.  It's not bad, right?  No.  In this picture that the WWF shot, I'm like nipping out and stuff.  Oh, really?  Really bad boobs.  What the 12-year-old pointy was?  The price you pay.  It's so funny Joe mentioned that because I picked up the Raw Magazine yesterday.  Yeah.  And I saw that.  I'm like, whoa, what is that? 
[00:07:30]  You take pictures, man.  Sometimes you get a wacky shadow in there or something.  You're like, oh, now I've got to live with this until another picture comes out in public.  Hey, you know, I'm no Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything, but...  That's a wonderful thing.  But I don't know.  Plus, it's been working out since that picture.  I think that picture's like two months old now.  Is she happy with her large boobs?  Sounds like this one.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, I had a bang-up week, and we all did.  Well, Anthony... 
[00:08:00]  We went up to Boston.  Well, we're going to get into all that next.  Yeah.  This was kind of just like the pre-show.  Yeah, I know.  We've got to talk about that.  I think I saw Mission Impossible 2 this weekend.  I think I did.  We'll talk about Mission Impossible.  We've got to talk about that.  We'll talk about the Knicks.  We'll talk about one of the best concerts I've seen in five years.  Unbelievable.  We've got to talk about Stone Temple Pilots.  We went up to Boston to see them in this huge, huge concert.  Foxborough Stadium up there. 
[00:08:30]  River Rape 2000 in Boston.  There was like 10, 12 bands on one stage.  Another, like 10 bands on another stage.  It was sick.  It was absolutely sick.  We'll talk about that next, all right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Because we could tell you all about Scott Weiland and STP and how great they sounded.  They rocked.  And if you've got something for the show, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  It's O&A, and we are live today.  It's Tuesday, May 30th.  I promise.  We're here.  Give us a call, and we'll talk to you next.  Opie.  Keep your hands.  Always need your pants. 
[00:09:00]  Uh-huh.  Too late.  And Anthony.  I'm just a point of a fact.  More stupidity on the way.  1-0-2-7-7-1-0-2-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  Our new pal, Richard Patrick, and Filter in the background.  Wow.  What a blast we had, man.  Yeah, we saw Filter over the weekend.  We saw Godsmack over the weekend.  We saw STP, Static X, Power Man 5000. 
[00:09:30]  I didn't see Cypress Hill because I wanted to get home.  Yeah, we've got to talk about it.  We went up to Boston this weekend.  Yeah.  Our old stomping grounds.  Yep.  We were invited to the WBCN River Rave 2000 up there at Foxborough Stadium.  Foxborough Stadium, a football stadium full of lunatics. 
[00:10:00]  60,000 people checking out this show.  Insanity.  I believe this same show is going to be in New York very soon.  Yes.  Most of the band's playing.  Under a different name.  Under a different name, yeah.  Three letters.  Yeah.  Three letters.  What are the three letters?  The DFP.  The DFP, right.  The DFP, okay.  That's our sister station.  I think we could give them a little plug.  We're all one big happy family.  Just like, well, WBCN up there is one of our stations under the infinity umbrella.  Right.  Opie.  And you all know how palsy we were with them for many years. 
[00:10:30]  Yes.  No, we've broken bread, mended our bridges with them.  And we were privy to a great, great concert, man.  What a concert.  Yeah, it was our first public appearance in Boston since we got fired for saying the mayor died in a car accident.  I mean, we've been up a bunch of times since then, but this was the first time we actually got to see our old listeners and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh.  It was pretty cool.  We got to get back up there.  Yeah.  We ain't leaving this place.  Hell no.  I think we have a bigger audience down here than we ever had in Boston, but we definitely have some fans up there. 
[00:11:00]  And we're going to try to syndicate the damn show eventually.  Well, stepping out on stage in front of all those people to bring on STP was like, oh, my God.  Looking out at a stadium full of people.  Let me tell you something.  I mean, I've been in front of large crowds as well as you have, Anthony, you know, introing bands and stuff on stages.  That was the biggest throw of my life this Saturday.  It was 60,000 people. 
[00:11:30]  They announced our name.  The place went BS.  How many chances do you get to stand in front of a football stadium full of people like that?  Right.  You know, it was pretty sick.  And we announced Stone Temple Pilots.  And I got to tell you guys, you guys are in for a treat when they come to New York.  They are right on the money at the top of their game.  Unbelievable.  Scott Weiland is back.  Better than ever.  Sounds great.  I've seen STP a bunch in the past, and I got to say, he never sounded better. 
[00:12:00]  I think he's off the dope.  Well, that's what they're saying.  I was reading an article in Rolling Stone magazine.  It looks like he's clean.  For now.  For now.  The rest of the band is, like, very weary about the whole thing.  Yeah, it's got to be scary.  It's like, yeah, it's cool, but we're not, you know, we're not counting our whole future on Scott Weiland.  You think they get done with the show and put him in that Silence of the Lambs getup,  just prop him up in a corner on a hand truck with a mask on so he can't do any drugs or anything,  and then wheel him out for the next show?  Yeah. 
[00:12:30]  Because, I mean, the rest of the band has just got to be, oh, we're cranking again.  How many chances are we going to get to redeem ourselves after this guy F's up, you know?  Yeah.  And then they come back, and now, I mean, better than ever.  Hit.  Unbelievable.  Hit after hit after hit after hit.  That's what it was.  You just forget how many freaking Stone Temple Pilot hit songs there are.  Yeah.  And you want to hear every single one of them.  They played them.  They had 60,000 people singing along to Plush.  It was one of the sickest things I've ever seen in concert.  Pretty cool. 
[00:13:00]  And Scott Weiland with that damn, you know, bullhorn.  God, is that cool as hell.  Yeah.  Now, did security kick you off the stage?  No.  What happened?  No, I wanted to see STP from the crowd.  Oh, okay.  You were, like, right on the side of the stage for STP.  Oh, my God.  Like, 15 feet away from center stage.  Like, I was right on the side of the stage as they're playing.  It was unbelievable.  Like, at one point, at the end of the set, before the encore, Scott Weiland comes over. 
[00:13:30]  And he's, like, right next to me.  And he kind of looks at me.  I look at him.  I'm just like, I go, I go, God damn, Scott.  Effing fantastic.  I know.  What do you say?  What do you say?  And he's like, you know, I kind of, like, raise his eyebrows.  Like, eh.  Yeah.  Takes a towel off his head.  Runs back out.  But it was just like, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Noah's looking at him.  Noah was cool.  He knew he was on, too.  Yeah.  He just knew.  It was just amazing.  Kick that.  Steve from the City. 
[00:14:00]  Did any members of the band clue you into their next secret concert this time?  Yeah.  Oops.  Steve, cut it out.  You guys have a sense of humor out there, but.  You're going to get us in trouble.  But they were absolutely amazing.  Yeah.  We have a new best friend, Richard Patrick of Filter.  Wow.  Now we have to go.  And this guy party.  Holy smoke.  Filter had a great set up there at the River Raven Boston.  And he was, like, walking around backstage. 
[00:14:30]  And he was beating himself up going, man, I sounded great, but my band sucked.  So, yeah, we were a little off today.  So, and I had to cuddle him and go, dude, man, you sounded unbelievable.  It sounded great.  It sounded great.  You know?  Stop beating yourself up.  Yeah.  And that's when he looks at me, looks at us, he goes, oh, my God, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Now we've got to go back.  If you guys remember, we interviewed Filter about a month and a half ago on our show here  in New York.  And we told you that as they were leaving, Richard Patrick said that it was the best interview 
[00:15:00]  on the entire tour.  It wasn't an interview.  Right.  We were just hanging out.  Yeah.  And that's what you should do if you do a radio show.  Screw the interview.  You should just hang out and have fun.  But he said it was the best interview or hang out he's done on the whole tour.  And I've heard that in the past.  Like, whatever.  They're just kissing ass, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  But backstage in Boston, he reiterated.  He said, you guys, man, I had so much fun with you.  So then all of a sudden he goes, hey, man, you want to go drink some beers?  Yeah.  Well, of course, we were with our friend Jay up in Boston, too.  Yeah.  And boy, that boy likes to drink. 
[00:15:30]  Well, he's Irish.  And between me and him, we're like, you know, it's a constant search for fresh beer.  Yeah.  So the little backstage area, the beers were out.  So we're like, oh, where can we get a beer?  So Rich is like, you know, oh, I got beer back in the dressing room.  Like, oh, cool.  We'll follow you.  Yeah.  Pulls out a big bus tray full of ice and beer and vodka and whatnot.  And we just sat down on the couches and pounded.  Yeah.  He was so freaking cool.  He's going to call us this week because we hit it off. 
[00:16:00]  We hit it off to the point where he goes, hey, man, what are you guys doing tomorrow?  I'm like, I don't know.  I'm probably going back to New York.  You know, we're up here for the weekend.  He goes, hey, you want to fly to Washington?  We're playing Washington tomorrow.  I'd love to hang out with you guys some more.  Like, well.  Yeah, we got to get back.  Yeah.  We unfortunately have real lives.  We're not rock stars like you guys.  We could just, like, fly around the country drinking and performing on stages.  That was funny, man.  We were getting tanked.  But we had a great time.  We were just talking about how he wants to get an ultralight. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Just like, man, I want to get an ultralight.  Yeah.  What are you, crazy?  Yeah.  Like, you get killed or break your neck, end up like Christopher.  No, man.  Does that look like the coolest thing?  And you don't need a pilot's license or anything.  Yeah.  I'm laughing at my ass.  I'm going, come on.  You're going to kill yourself.  You know what was interesting about that whole hangout with us and him and everybody?  How he was talking about, what, Atlantic City?  Yeah.  And he was really distraught because he lost $2,100 in Atlantic City. 
[00:17:00]  And I'm looking at him like, but you're like a rock star.  You had the hottest rock song of the year last year with taking pictures.  It's like platinum, man, you know?  More than platinum, I think.  You could afford $2,100.  But he was like you and I.  He was bumming.  He was as bummed as you and I would be if we lost $2,100 in Atlantic City.  So that was a highlight.  Then we got to see God Smack, our old pals.  Yeah.  They were unfreaking believable.  Rocked.  That's when the place went completely bullcrap. 
[00:17:30]  And the people up in the stands, in a human waterfall over the side to get onto the field,  the police had nothing they could do.  There was nothing they could do.  It was a human wave.  We took over the stadium, man.  That was funny.  I was standing kind of side stage, but kind of on the field,  but on the backstage side of the barricade.  And people just pouring over. 
[00:18:00]  And I'm watching going, oh, man, if they lose this side, the stage is gone.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah.  So everyone's jumping over, and the police can't do anything about it.  This one drunk guy decides to jump down, like, right next to where I am.  And there's, like, five cops right there.  So he took the brunt of the frustration the cops had that they couldn't do anything about  the thousands of people that were going over the wall.  Like, dude, if you moved down 10 feet and jumped over, you'd have been fine.  But he jumps right in front of the police, and they just grabbed him.  And hundreds upon hundreds of people just running onto the field. 
[00:18:30]  It was cool to watch that whole thing develop, because, I mean, we've all been at these stadium  shows and stuff.  Yeah.  And there was a bunch of people, you know, on the floor, and a bunch of people in the  stands.  And the people on the floor were encouraging everyone in the stands, come on, man, come  on, join us.  Yeah, come on, jump.  And everyone in the stadium was pushing, you know, closer and closer to the front row,  Anthony, of the, you know, the stadium part.  Yeah.  And then finally, it just takes one brave soul to go for it.  And slowly but surely, they start, you know, trickling over the walls.  And then...  So chicks, like, trying to jump over the side with their skirts and stuff, and their legs 
[00:19:00]  are in the air.  They're hitting their heads.  They're, like, falling off of the side thing.  It was hysterical.  Yeah.  Oh, that overhead camera thing on the boom?  You know, the concerts that got the boom cameras?  It was panning the crowd at one point and got a little low.  And some guy jumped up and grabbed it, pulled it right into the crowd.  And that's it.  It was a few bucks.  They're writing about you and I in Boston the last few days, too.  Oh, yeah?  It caused a little problem with all the girls flashing at the concert. 
[00:19:30]  What happened?  Oh, we just encouraged everyone to do some wowing.  A little wowage.  I've never seen more breasts in my life, especially on the big jumbotron thing they got there, the  camera, the screens.  Yeah, they had all the wowing on the screens.  Just boobage.  For 60,000 people.  Oh, so that was unbelievable.  We had a pisser.  And then someone wants to know if Stephanie McMahon was there.  Yeah.  Stephanie McMahon, another new friend of the radio show. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, we talked with her.  We're minding our own business, drinking some buds and playing some of the video games backstage  in between bands.  And all of a sudden, I hear, where's Opie and Anthony?  I want to meet them.  And here comes this woman, this incredibly gorgeous woman walking toward us.  She is so freaking hot in person, it's not even funny.  Yeah.  TV does not do her justice.  Unbelievable.  I think she's hot on TV, don't get me wrong, but in person, she is a knockout. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, so like right there, she's got a little skirt on, showing her legs, which are like  really shapely.  Legs forever, too.  Yeah.  Long, shapely legs, just beautiful in person.  Big set of cans on her, righto?  Yeah, remember she was talking about how saggy they are and stuff when we were interviewing  her?  And then she's, you know, it's funny, she's talking on the phone with us last week about  how she feels that her breasts are saggy and that somebody here said that she had a flat  ass.  Yeah.  So now we're looking at her live, and what are you looking at? 
[00:21:00]  Her ass in her booze.  Now you're just looking at her ass in her booze to see, you know, and trying to talk to her.  And Stephanie says she listens to the show a lot.  Let me tell you, Stephanie, you do not have a flat ass.  No.  We saw for ourselves, by the way.  She looked hot.  She really did.  Unbelievable.  She'll kick your ass, I think.  I think she's been working out.  Yeah.  You know?  She's getting some muscles.  This guy said he ran into you up there.  Uh, Tim, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I remember you.  You're a security guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That was the sickest show I've ever worked in my life. 
[00:21:30]  You guys were at a loss when people just started pouring over the sides, man.  I still got no voice left trying to get my guys out of the barricades.  Yeah.  Because it collapses.  You guys pulled the barricades away.  I just saw the perimeter getting smaller and smaller, the security perimeter.  They, like, totally disconnected some of the gates and then connected them to make the  perimeter shorter, so it ended up being just about by the stage area.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, if they would have gotten past that, it would have been all over.  We had to push them to the wall.  We knew we were going to lose it. 
[00:22:00]  We just didn't know when we were going to lose it.  Yeah.  I swear I thought the stage was going to go.  Oh, that's awesome.  I thought if one smartass hops over that gate and a few other people go, they had the cops  in riot gear backstage waiting.  And it was, I got to say, though, it was a tame show in general.  Yeah.  What?  90 arrests out of 60,000 people.  Yeah.  Yeah, that wasn't bad.  And if you go to their website, WBCN, whatever it is, their total count on hooter shots is  1,041 different hooters.  Wow. 
[00:22:30]  Are any of those boob shots on a website?  Because our listeners would love to check that out.  There's no boob shots.  That's the difference between Ant and I and everyone else.  All those boob shots would have been on our website and everyone could check them out  because there were hundreds upon hundreds of women just showing their boobs at this concert.  There was so many different shapes, sizes, forms.  Yeah.  I don't even look.  I'm in the city right now.  I'm not even checking out hooters.  Yeah, that rock, man.  Yeah.  What about that? 
[00:23:00]  What about that?  I just wanted to call in and, you know, I got to get my voice back now.  Yeah, you better drink some of my tea.  Another thing, I cannot believe the static between the two radio stations up there, that  WAAF, too.  Well, we're the big problem.  We're the problem between those two stations, man.  Yeah, because we were the one who, Ant and I put AAF on the map in Boston, and then they  fired us, and now we're working for BCN, so it's just a mess up there, an actual mess.  The only way to really get kind of a line on what it's all about up there between the 
[00:23:30]  two radio stations is, picture if Opie and I all of a sudden turned up on K-Rock.  Just blasting how NEW sucks and how we're over there.  Like, and buddy-buddy with people that we, on a daily basis, say we can't stand.  Yeah.  That's what it would seem like.  There was the plane pulling the banner around saying WBCN sucks and all that. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  They're intense.  They hate each other.  It's great.  They hate each other, and we're the main reason for that.  We are.  The people are screaming at you guys when you guys get on there.  Yeah, it's great.  People are roaring.  We haven't been up there in, like, two years, and the response was very, very flattering.  It was awesome.  Why didn't Mayor Menino check in and say hello?  Well, actually, Anthony, we got instant feedback from the mayor of Boston.  Oh, yeah?  Thomas Menino.  Hey, you guys.  You were in Boston.  Why didn't you stop by to say hi? 
[00:24:30]  All right, Tim.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  Take care.  All right.  Karen, what's going on?  Hello?  You want to correct our grammar?  Yeah.  All right, okay.  Who was the one that said about us, about Opie and I?  I guess it was Anthony, right?  What did I say?  You said about Opie and I and whatever.  It should be Opie and me because it's object of the proposition. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, object of the proposition.  Jesus Christ.  I love you guys, and I think you're great, but I don't want you making mistakes like that.  Yeah.  Hey, Karen?  Yeah?  Could you make sure I have proper grammar on the following statement?  Is it going to be me?  No, not at all.  You sure?  Yeah.  Oh, wait, Opie.  Now, though that was grammatically proper, I don't believe the FCC would allow that to air.  You stupid bitch.  Oh, that's okay.  I hate when people correct our grammar. 
[00:25:30]  It's not easy to do four and a half hours.  Some slang's going to pop out, and yeah, our grammar's going to suck from time to time.  Sit back and enjoy the show.  Now, how would I place it if I was hanging out with her?  Would I say the jizz bucket and me?  Or would I say, hmm, me?  I don't get it.  All right.  Don't correct our grammar.  We understand.  Please.  We're not English professors. 
[00:26:00]  We're stupid radio personalities trying to entertain you.  You hang on a bar with your friends.  You're correcting grammar.  Geez.  What a life.  Know who else we saw up there?  Oh.  Dave from the Real World Seattle.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Strutting his stuff.  This guy had an entourage that was larger than Scott Wyland's.  He thought, he's from Boston, and he was walking around like he was the ass, you know?  Yeah.  Had a whole entourage.  So I'm glad he wasn't looking anyone in the eye.  He's just walking around like waiting to be noticed. 
[00:26:30]  It was sick.  It was hilarious.  It was sort of sad.  So it was just a lot of fun, man.  Yeah, what a party.  And that on the heels of the road show Thursday.  Yeah, why don't we talk about the road show next, Anthony?  Yeah.  What a time.  We have to take a break, but...  You know, when Stone Temple Pilots come to New York, all we have to say is you guys are in for a huge treat.  Yep.  An absolute huge treat.  Mm-hmm.  What, July 31st, PNC Art Center?  And August 12th and 13th at Jones Beach? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  That's with the Chili Peppers and Fishbone?  You're going to love it.  You're my favorite band again, Anthony.  Yeah.  I'm just sorting through instant feedbacks.  Got a lot of them.  Yeah.  Since we're coming back.  Yeah, you know, a lot of people missed us, I guess, on Big Jesus.  We had to take some time off.  That was dog sick, too.  People saying not too many close-up shots of the ladies from the road show. 
[00:27:30]  We got a lot of video and pictures up on the Foundry Music site.  Yeah, let's get Steve from FoundryMusic.com on the line because he's going through video still.  He's got hours of material up on the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Let's talk about the road show next, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  212-757-1027.  And we're doing another wow sticker stop today, Anthony.  Why is Earl going?  It says Earl.  I don't want to read that name anymore. 
[00:28:00]  If he's going, I don't care.  Don't write it down anymore.  Psycho Mark, you going?  Yeah, me in the slide.  All right.  Psycho Mark's going to be at...  You drive.  Psycho Mark's going to be at Strauss Discount Auto.  Strauss Discount Auto.  Pick up your Excel Micro Edge Wiper Blades.  Oh, very good.  Bosch...  Bosch Micro Edge Excel...  What?  Bosch Triple Edge Micro Edge Excel Wiper...  I don't know what the hell they are.  Whatever.  We get with your wipers.  Get your wow stickers at today's wow sticker stop, which is Strauss Discount Auto, 
[00:28:30]  664 East 14th Street.  Strauss.  Where's that between, man?  Do you know offhand?  14th and what?  That's probably what?  Hey?  It's down.  It's way on the east side.  Way on the east side.  Okay.  664 East 14th Street.  Strauss Discount Auto.  Psycho Mark will be there around 430.  Yeah.  So stop by and say hi to him and get your wow stickers.  We'll talk about the road show next.  Stay there.  Hey, what's up?  This is Gino, and this is Richard, and we're from the band Filter. 
[00:29:00]  And you're listening to our friends Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  AnthonyPriceline.com.  Ah, yes.  Priceline's all over the place, man.  We talked to William Shatner just before we took the four-day weekend.  Yes, we did.  He didn't want to speak with us that much.  It sounded like he got on the phone and realized who we were, and that was it.  Yeah.  That was all right.  Whatever.  We're not going to be friends with everyone.  We don't know that.  I love Captain Kirk. 
[00:29:30]  I watch all the Star Trek episodes.  Priceline.  Of course, you've seen William Shatner in Priceline.  Everyone knows what Priceline's all about.  It's naming your own price for just about everything in the world.  It's amazing.  Now you name your own price for groceries.  Every single day, Priceline figured out a way to name your own price for groceries.  Everything you buy, beef, chicken, soda, cereal, coffee, diapers, whatever, you can save up to half off, half off your grocery bill every time you go shopping.  It's not a delivery service.  You log on to Priceline.com before you go to the store.  Name your price.  Get your groceries wherever you like to shop. 
[00:30:00]  A&P, ShopRite, Wall Bounds, King Cullen, Cristides, D'Agostino's, Food Emporium.  Get the message.  It's like everywhere you shop.  First airline tickets.  Now groceries at up to half off.  Just log on to Priceline before you go to the store.  Name your own price.  Priceline for groceries.  It's bigger than...  Big.  Jimmy and Anthony.  Bunch, ladies and gentlemen.  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show. 
[00:30:30]  Go make a mitle.  1027.  NW.  212-757.  1027 is our phone number.  If you want to send us a fax, 212-957-9639.  Uh, Joe Soprano from foundrymusic.com.  Always checking in.  Kudos on your new legal ID.  Ha ha ha.  Yeah, where is that?  Give me that legal ID. 
[00:31:00]  Look what the station did for us.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Home by Infinity Broadcasting.  She is 1027.  WNEW.  New New New York.  Wow.  We are taking over.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  We are taking over.  Kudos on your new legal ID.  However, when you hear NW on the weekend, it's hard to believe the station is powered by Opie and Anthony.  Ah, yeah.  So they play that and then they go right into like some moldy oldy Neil Young song or something. 
[00:31:30]  Ah.  Great.  Hey, Daryl from Westbury.  Hey, guys.  I got Stephen Lynch and Mike's FBA live at the road show on MP3.  Hey, so if anyone wants to go to Napster, just don't sue me.  Ha ha ha.  Yeah, we're taking down names.  We've gotten a lot of emails.  We're all over Napster.  Yeah, we don't mind being on Napster.  We're one of those artists that appreciate people downloading our stuff and spreading it around.  We were going to talk about the road show, but you mentioned Napster. 
[00:32:00]  I got a very interesting email from one of our listeners, and he makes some really good points here, Anthony.  Is he sure it's one of our listeners?  Yeah, definitely.  We got some intelligence out there.  Robert writes, to whom this may concern.  Did he snort like that?  No, I'm sorry.  I'm still stuffed up here, man.  My father told me of this web page and told me I should write this letter to you guys.  I am one of the unfortunate people who are caught up in the mess with Metallica and Napster  and banning all the people that have downloaded their songs. 
[00:32:30]  Do you know what's going on with this, Anthony?  Yes.  Do you want to explain really fast?  Napster, a website you can go to, and you trade MP3s.  You trade music with other people that are logged on to Napster.  You have to download their little software and stuff.  And it's easy, it's quick, and it's pretty cool.  I like it.  Well, Metallica had a problem with it because a lot of their music was being traded back and forth.  And Lars took it upon himself to sit down, I guess, and take down all the names of people 
[00:33:00]  that have traded Metallica songs on Napster.  And they got the names of over 300,000 people.  And now these people have been banned from going on to Napster and trading music again.  Well, one of the guys wrote us, and he's bummed out about that, okay?  Okay, I've been trying for at least a week now to find a place where I can find Metallica  or at least a place where I can email them with the problem I'm having.  I downloaded three songs that Metallica put out a long time ago from their album called Metallica Metallica. 
[00:33:30]  Now, the problem I'm having with this is that because of those songs,  I am being banned due to the fact that they think that I am not a fan who has bought the album  and that I am allowing others to download them for me.  However, these songs that I have downloaded, I have on a CD of theirs that I bought around four years ago.  And I have never let anyone download them for me for the fact that it slows down my computer  and I only have Napster so I can listen to music late at night when I'm doing my homework  as to not disturb my parents.  So I am asking you if it's at all possible, if you know of a place, that I can contact them 
[00:34:00]  or write to them and explain the problem that I am having  and that I have in no way allowed anyone to illegally take their songs from me.  Thank you very much. Sincerely, Robert.  Wow.  Yeah, they banned everybody.  They banned everyone.  And here's a kid that bought the Metallica music.  He's downloading it so he can listen to this stuff late at night  because I'm assuming, you know, the entertainment center is probably close to mom and dad's room there or something. 
[00:34:30]  So he's up in his room doing his homework or hanging out, you know, checking out porn sites,  whatever he's doing, and listening to Metallica and now he's getting screwed.  How many times have you whipped off a tape for somebody in your day?  You know, you ever, like, you dub a tape and give it to somebody?  I think it's the spirit of rock and roll where you turn other people on to music.  You get an album and you make a copy and you go,  oh, dudes, check out the latest from Godsmack, let's say.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  I'm going to, you know, I'm going to become a fan. 
[00:35:00]  I'm going to go to their next show.  I'm going to, you know, buy their album, whatever.  Yeah.  I think they're screwing over their core audience.  All the people that were behind them for years and stuff,  those are the people that are going to the site to Napster and downloading the music.  What do they think it is?  What do they think?  People are downloading it, pressing out 100,000 copies of these things  and selling them for millions of dollars in their own pocket.  No.  Yeah.  It's a bunch of people like that kid that wants to do his homework  and listen to a tune over the computer, 
[00:35:30]  and that's who's getting shafted by this.  And Lars would say that the problem is, you know,  the copy you get is just as good as a digital master.  He says, in the past when you had an album and then you made a copy on cassette,  it wasn't the greatest quality, it wasn't as good, blah, blah, blah.  And that's where the difference is.  Please.  Go get more money for another soundtrack to a lousy movie.  Come on, they don't have enough money coming in.  What's the problem with Metallica now?  Well, I think the guys are a little hypocritical, 
[00:36:00]  because if you know anything about Metallica,  first of all, to this day they encourage people to, you know,  set up the video equipment and the audio equipment at their shows to tape it.  Bootlegging, always a big part of Metallica, sure.  From the beginning, because they weren't getting any radio airplay at first.  Because for the first ten years they were around, no one was playing their stuff.  You think if Jerry was still alive, man, Jerry Garcia,  he'd be all pissed off at Napster, too?  Yeah.  God, that would be a shame, wouldn't it?  You know, all of a sudden, wow, dude.  Yeah, well, when Metallica first came out, 
[00:36:30]  it was, you know, people were just making copies like crazy of the albums  and sending it to their buds all over the country.  Yeah.  That was their main marketing when they first started.  Yeah.  So it's kind of hypocritical now to say, hey, man, it's not cool.  Mm-hmm.  How were they banning people from Napster?  I don't understand.  Like, I know a lot of, I don't want to get into a bunch of technical computer stuff,  but a lot of people that log on to computers have a, what do they call a variable IP?  It identifies you on the net.  Mm-hmm.  But every time you log on, it's different. 
[00:37:00]  It's different, right.  Unless you're running like this place where you're working in a company,  you have a line and you have a static IP number.  It's the same every time you log on.  Right.  So they could identify that.  How do they do that?  You could just log on under a new name on your computer and start downloading again.  Mm-hmm.  Maybe somebody could help.  Plus, Metallica's screwing a lot of bands that, you know,  that don't have any marketing or a way to distribute their music.  A lot of bands that are trying to make it are putting their stuff on Napster  for people to check out as well, Anthony. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, Metallica says they don't want to, you know, they don't want to ban everyone,  but it's going to be all or nothing.  Ben from Long Island.  You could get back onto Napster if Metallica kicked you off by going to ask.com  and typing in how can I hack Napster.  Hack Napster.  I don't know if that's true, but that's Ben trying to help us out a little bit.  After hearing Lars pissing and moaning, I'm glad to be dead.  Oh, Cliff Burton.  Thank you, Kurt, for not drawing the short straw that night. 
[00:38:00]  Wow.  Oh.  Wow.  I saw it behind the music, too.  Hello.  Mike from Lodi, New Jersey.  I got shafted by those sell-out Metallica apps, too.  They suck.  I want my Napster back.  According to SoundScan, Metallica sold 12,000 copies of their 10-year-old Metallica album last week.  Hmm.  12,000 last week alone?  So what are they bitching about?  People are still buying their stuff like crazy.  Yeah.  I really don't think this is going to take away from their income. 
[00:38:30]  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  Mark from Brooklyn.  Signed that the apocalypse is coming.  Seeing Lars doing a Sunday morning news show.  Yeah, he was all over the Sunday news shows, which is so bizarre, man.  I guess the next step is having hard rock bands coming up on stage in suits and ties.  Maybe they'll ban beer at the shows and start serving caviar.  Tell that guy to go to www.scour.net to download Scour Exchange. 
[00:39:00]  It's the same thing as Napster for video, music, and images.  Napster uses cookies and puts other stuff on your hard drive to identify you.  Well, you can erase those.  You can delete those cookies.  Johnny B. Stuhl from Jersey writes, yeah, but instead of giving a few tapes to a few friends,  you're giving it to millions of people.  How do you guys think these musicians make money?  By overcharging in the record stores.  Wake up, Johnny.  What an idiot.  Yeah.  The CD prices have been ridiculous. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  You think Metallica's starving?  No, I think they're doing just fine.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Steve from the city, the sickening thing is that they used to encourage bootleg tapes.  Metallica has sold out almost as much as...  Name we're not allowed to say on this show.  Fill in the blank.  Mike from Manhattan.  Metallica should concentrate their efforts on the buying and selling of UCDs.  The artists get no royalties off of these sales. 
[00:40:00]  Napster users don't buy or sell.  They're just trading.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, hey, can I come over and borrow your CD?  Or you make a tape or something.  It's ridiculous.  It's been the spirit of rock for as long as I can remember.  To get albums, make cassettes, turn them on to your friends, make a cassette for the car, whatever.  And with these MP3 players, you know, you want to download all this stuff and put it on an MP3 player. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  It's just easier.  Tony from Hurley, F Metallica.  Could they stop pissing and moaning about fans?  If they have a good argument here, then Phish fans everywhere are in deep ass.  All right.  Got a mic really fast here.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You just gave it out right there.  Napster puts a cookie on your computer.  Delete all the cookies.  You get right back in.  Yeah, that's what I think.  That's what I did. 
[00:41:00]  I got back in on my computer.  There was one cookie that I wouldn't delete, but I finally got rid of it and it led me back into Napster.  Wait, did you get banned?  I was banned.  You were banned, huh?  I was banned from Napster.  And another thing you should do...  Wait, wait, wait.  All right, so were you banned for doing the whole Metallica thing?  Yeah, I was banned from the whole Metallica thing.  All right, what were you doing with your Metallica downloads?  I just downloaded them.  Listen to them while I was playing a game online.  So you weren't downloading them and making CDs and sending them off to your friends?  Not at all.  See, I think most people are not doing that.  You just download it.  First of all, it's something kind of new and stuff. 
[00:41:30]  You download it and you just want to see how it works, you know?  You do it because it's like, wow, you could do this?  Yeah, this is pretty cool.  Let me hear what it sounds like.  You know, running off a master and then pressing out CDs so a Nigerian can sell them on the corner.  What is that all about?  Yeah, I think it's a small percentage of people that are turning around and trying to make a profit off their stuff in that way.  I've got another way around it for you.  Yeah.  There's a website, Napigator.com.  Okay.  You can download a patch that puts you right back in the Napster. 
[00:42:00]  You just use different servers to get in.  All right, cool.  Thank you, buddy.  No problem.  All right.  Don from East Meadow.  Metallica should be enemy of the show.  By the way, I just finished downloading about ten of your bits and Stephen Lynch's songs.  Yeah, we're all over Napster.  How many bits have we got?  Let it rip, man.  It all depends on how many people are logged on with our bits on their hard drives.  So it varies.  You guys, get our stuff all over Napster.  We don't care.  Yeah, we don't care.  We have a CD out there that sold a lot of copies, but we don't make any money off it. 
[00:42:30]  We don't care.  Rob from...  We just want to spread the word of the show.  Rob from Jersey.  Lars and Metallica are doing this not for the money.  They're doing it to protect the musicians and their right to have their music on such a service as Napster.  At this point, Napster did not give Metallica the choice to have their music on Napster.  Let me tell you something, Rob.  Their music isn't on Napster.  That's the whole thing.  It's on other people's computers.  You just use Napster as the go-between between your hard drive and someone else's hard drive to get the music. 
[00:43:00]  So Napster can't be held for posting Metallica's music without their permission.  It's just like a place that people go to trade stuff.  Used to do it with porno pictures, remember?  No one cared about that.  Right.  You go into a little chat room.  Hey, man, you got any big-breasted teens?  And then all of a sudden, yeah, you're trading pictures.  It's all about fighting the system, though, too.  We're sick of the prices of CDs.  If we're going to find a way where we can get some free music here and there from a friend or from this service, we're going to do it. 
[00:43:30]  So we've been raped over the coals for too long now.  I think this is going to hurt Metallica.  Mike from New York.  I really do.  There's a site you can go to to pay back Lars for the MP3s.  You download it.  Yeah, that's a pretty funny site.  The site is around.  It's www.paylars.com.  Are you just as disgusted as I am?  Napster.  It's going to be big.  Really big. 
[00:44:00]  Let's see.  Trey from Fish says he's okay with Napster.  What's Lars going to do next?  Look, I don't like people coming to the concert and listening to the music and then leaving with the memory of our music.  So, like, we're going to have people get full lobotomies after the show.  So, like, that way they'll have to, like, come back again.  Because, like, they're leaving with the knowledge of the words and music that we, like, put together.  Shut up.  Evil kid from the city.  Bottom line.  It's illegal. 
[00:44:30]  It's copyright infringement.  And, dude, stop making it sound like it's only Metallica that's pissed.  There's many artists in the music industry pissed off as well.  You explain to me how the hell that's copyright infringement.  It isn't.  Yeah, go ahead, evil kid.  Explain it.  It's not.  It is not.  Soon it's going to be.  I swear to God.  It's bordering on.  You play the stereo loud enough where people outside your house are going to hear it.  Oh, wait a minute.  Now, you bought this just for you.  And now someone passing by is going to enjoy the sounds of Metallica. 
[00:45:00]  You know?  Can only be played in soundproof room.  Eat me, Lars.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  Pretty good.  Actually, everyone's already made my point.  That being that the first demo they made was completely gotten across this country by illegal copies.  Yeah, I know that.  It's kind of like they lost their hand and they lost their minds with it, too, I guess.  I've been a Metallica fan since the beginning.  You're so right.  Their first album was bootlegged all over the damn country.  That's how they became popular.  Yeah, I mean, you just feel like the VH1 special is exactly what they go into. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  They were making copies in their basement, basically, and just mailing them to people and handing  them out at their road shows and saying, pass this around for us.  Yeah, well, it just goes to show, I guess, right?  Yeah.  Good luck, guys.  All right.  Syndicate to a Metallica, so I have to worry about this kind of crap.  All right, cool.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, Limp Bizkit's doing that free show sponsored by Napster.  Yeah.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, man?  How are you?  Pretty good.  When did Lars become such a cheap ass?  He's got more money than God, man. 
[00:46:00]  It's horrible, isn't it?  It's a little strange.  You know, back then, I remember when I was listening to Metallica, it was, like, so cool  because, you know, like, they wouldn't do videos and all this crap, and they're the hardest  band, and now they're, like, the biggest commercial punks.  Right.  Now they're wearing makeup and stuff.  It's pretty sad.  All right, Mike.  All right, later.  Thank you.  Go to Shane real fast.  Shane, you're next on WNEW.  Hello?  Shane, what's up?  You know, like...  You're cursed, so no one just heard what you said. 
[00:46:30]  Shane, you can't use the answer.  When they release singles, you can just buy a tape and record it on the radio.  I mean, or record off MTV, or, you know, and then give it to your pal.  Yeah, no one's up in arms about that.  Or even when you run a dupe off of a tape, a cassette player or something.  Or when they have a CD release, like, show on 93.2, 3, K-Rock, and you hear the whole  album, you can just record it on a tape.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you, Shane.  Peace out.  Yeah, rock on. 
[00:47:00]  Rock on.  John from Queens.  Didn't movie studios get all pissed when VCRs came out?  Everyone said people will tape movies and not spend any money in the theaters.  Yeah, remember that?  Guess what?  Movies make more money now than ever before.  That is true.  Groups like Metallica are so short-sighted.  Good job to piss off your fans, Metallica.  Hmm.  Bill from Brooklyn.  What about the fact that Metallica blows and haven't put out a good album since, and  Justice for All?  A lot of people, yeah.  Getting really, really pissed. 
[00:47:30]  Well, the hardcore fans were pissed off at him before this because they said they sold  out.  Now, this is only reinforcing it.  I mean, this is really pissing off the fans.  Yeah.  Let's go to Jack.  Jack.  Hey, Jack.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, well, what's up?  Just letting you know, if you go to any of Metallica websites, like metoncour.com, right?  It's got this really cool intro, and everybody's yelling, like, F no Lars, F Lars, right? 
[00:48:00]  And that uses flash.  The only way you can get audio in a flash is through MP3, which means all the intros to  all their websites are encoded in MP3.  That's, like, the biggest irony of it all.  That's interesting.  So, peace out, guys.  All right, Jack.  Thank you.  Take care.  All right.  We're just about done with this.  Wendy, what's up?  Hello?  Hi, Wendy.  Oh, hello.  I'm not sure what website it is, but there's a website you can go on, and Lars is asking  for money.  Paylarz.com. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, they're asking for money that they lost from their record sales.  To be fair, he didn't put that up there.  Oh, he didn't?  It's someone with a lot of sarcasm in there.  A little joke.  Oh, I thought he put it up there.  No.  And also, they didn't lose record sales because of Masters, because their new stuff sucks.  That's what people are saying.  Yeah, I used to love them.  Their new stuff is awful.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right, Anthony. 
[00:49:00]  And that's what we have to say about that.  That's all I've got to say.  Bob in Jersey.  If it's illegal to make money off of other people's ideas, then why is Jay Moore walking  free?  You guys have a great sense of humor.  Why should I pay $15 for a CD that costs less than a dollar to make?  You've got to pay an S-load of people. 
[00:49:30]  They have to get their cut.  All right.  Yeah.  That's better for the Napster thing.  Thank you very much for your input, people.  Yes.  I'm right now at the who cares phase.  I went there once, and, like, with my connection, it would have taken, like, an hour to download  something, so I said, screw it.  Yeah.  That's pretty funny.  Down with Metallica from hell.  Screw Metallica.  They can't stop us.  They suddenly turn from the badass in the leather jackets to the dork who's the hall monitor. 
[00:50:00]  There's one more I want to read before we go into break here.  It's actually a different topic, too.  Oh, my God.  You guys are killing us with feedback today.  Did you see Kid Rock on Raw last night?  Yeah.  It almost sounded like he said F right over the air, and the dumb guy missed it, and he  bleeped, like, the next 10 seconds of what he said.  Well, that constantly happens. 
[00:50:30]  They definitely got the F word out last night on the USA.  Totally dead.  Totally dead.  It was, like, the whole word except for, like, half the K.  Yeah.  And then a big 10-second bleep after that.  All the C got in there.  Yeah.  Because half the K was missing.  Right.  So, I mean...  And then they always do that, though.  When someone curses on WWF when they're doing a live show.  Uh-huh.  And then you'll hear, beep, for, like, 10 seconds after the curse.  Good job.  Yeah, they sounded great, though, on Raw. 
[00:51:00]  They should do that on this show.  So, we've got a few curses, though.  Yeah.  And let's take a break.  All right.  What the hell?  Kid Rock's new album comes out today, American Badass.  I don't think it's going to kill anyone if we play one real fast here, okay?  All right.  It's WNEW.  We will talk about the road show next.  O.B.  And Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Mad Pat from Selden, Long Island.  Hey, guys.  I was watching the People's Court yesterday, and I saw a shady guy looking around, and then 
[00:51:30]  all of a sudden, he held up a WOW sign, and then slipped out of the picture smoothly.  It was pretty damn funny the way he did it.  Yeah, we got lots of reports that WOW made it on the People's Court yesterday.  Thank you for that.  I'm seeing the stickers everywhere.  Everywhere.  It's just taking over.  Absolutely amazing.  A lot of people want the WOW t-shirts that were given out at the road show.  God, I didn't even see one.  I threw a couple out, but I didn't even see what they looked like.  They looked just like the bumper sticker.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, black t-shirts with the WOW logo looks great. 
[00:52:00]  We're going to have to try to figure something out, because we've always said we're not about  merchandising and stuff.  We don't want the coffee cups.  You see the Z100 crap.  Yeah, yeah.  We never want to be known for having an O.P.  and Anthony coffee cup all of a sudden or something like that.  But I don't know.  These WOW shirts are pretty cool.  Yeah.  And a lot of people want them, so we might talk to the bosses and see if we can maybe  sell them really, really cheap.  Oh, yeah?  Maybe.  We're going to talk about it tomorrow. 
[00:52:30]  There is a demand, though.  I mean, a lot of people emailed us and said, hey, I was at the road show and want one of  those WOW t-shirts.  We'll go broke if we just make them and give them to everybody.  Like, WOW stickers.  Yeah.  So, we'll have to figure that out.  Very popular item at the road show, though.  Yeah, we'll talk about the road show next.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  We're summer officially here, I guess, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Is it too late to get the body in shape?  Yes.  Definitely.  So now what are we talking?  Get the body you want in time for winter?  Yeah.  You know, right off summer, people.  You're just going to be pudgy.  But start Stacker 2.  No, there's still plenty of time.  Yeah.  Get, uh...  To lose that weight with Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner will be.  You take it within 45 minutes of taking it, you feel its effects, or you get your money  back. 
[00:53:30]  Lose that fat ass.  Well, I don't think it's too late, because we haven't had beach weather yet, anyway.  No.  Oh, that's right.  Wait, it's almost June.  I think everyone was wearing their, like, fall clothes to the beach this past weekend.  Yeah.  I got to say one thing about Stacker 2.  They have the best TV commercials.  Yeah, I was watching that on WWF.  Did you see that girl with the nips popping out and stuff?  The fat guy dancing around and singing.  How do they get away with that?  I don't know.  All right.  Everyone knows what Stacker 2 is about, right?  Yeah.  World's strongest fat burner.  Cuts down on the cravings to snack. 
[00:54:00]  And, uh, gives you a boost of energy.  It adds up to losing weight.  And, uh, there's still plenty of time left.  Come on.  What are you doing?  What are you waiting for?  You're going to be laying out there.  Oh, look at that big fat ass.  We all see it walking down the beach or something.  It's like, oh, you're looking at the blankets.  You're like, okay, ooh, that's not going to happen.  Oh, look at that big fat ass.  After seeing my picture in the latest Raw magazine, I think I'm going back on the Stacker 2.  Stacker 2, Opie?  To get rid of the man boobs that one of the listeners says I have.  That picture was pretty disturbing. 
[00:54:30]  Give me a Stacker 2.  I'll pop one right now.  Stacker 2.  Stacker 2, yeah.  Give them a call.  1-800-LITELINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Or visit them on the web.  www.stacker2.com.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Our listeners have proven it worked.  Britney Spears.  We don't play her music.  But we'd sure like to pin her legs back like a Tyson chicken.  Radio Gonzo Style.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:55:00]  1027 WNEW.  Gonzo Style.  I love that one.  Britney Spears is on MTV right now.  I'm checking out her camel toe.  Oh, yeah.  And that red latex outfit of hers.  That picture's on Foundry.  On foundrymusic.com, too.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A still picture.  Severe camel toe.  Well, let me see.  I got to say.  Looks like she's smuggling a yo-yo in her pants.  Yeah.  In front of her pants.  She's wearing a rubber suit.  Like a red rubber suit. 
[00:55:30]  I don't know if it's a rubber suit.  Oh, jeez.  And then back to Carson.  Carson Dale.  Like, too hip for the room.  Yeah.  Look it up.  Yeah, I'm here.  I know.  What a guy.  Got the best job in America, but I don't care.  And there's Fat Dave.  God, isn't his time up yet?  Look at that, Dave.  Poor guy.  Anyway, Anthony.  Oh, back to the show.  212-757-1027. 
[00:56:00]  Kathy from Jersey.  Hey, what about the dead guy in the foam?  The dead guy in the foam.  If you were at our road show, I'm proud to announce that no one died.  No.  We did forget about a guy in the foam.  When the foam, like, dissipated.  What's the word I do here?  That's a good word.  Dissipated.  We had foam on our road show.  You've probably seen him at, like, the, you know, rave parties and stuff.  The foam.  A big, huge pit.  And it was pumping foam out over strippers and naked women. 
[00:56:30]  It was amazing.  But I didn't even hear about this until right now.  Well, this guy got rambunctious.  Yeah.  Because he wasn't supposed to be in the foam.  And he jumped over the side to get in the middle of the lesbian action going on at the road show in the middle of the foam.  Yeah.  And he just flat out fell, knocked himself out.  Yeah.  And no one knew it.  That's the funny part.  No one knew it.  We saw it on the video, though.  There's video of this guy. 
[00:57:00]  And they only found out after the foam dissipated.  Like, the guy is out cold under the foam.  But no one knows he's dead.  Goddamn, that's great.  I didn't even hear about that.  So, I guess, once the foam dissipated, they saw a guy laying there bleeding from the head.  Out cold.  Not bleeding to death or anything.  Just a little head injury. 
[00:57:30]  Oops.  Oops is right.  Ouch.  Well, I'm not supposed to be there.  I'm proud to say the guy's doing fine, Anthony.  Very good.  He called the show a little while ago, matter of fact.  He's okay.  He's A-okay.  Speaking in complete sentences?  Yes, he is.  Speaking better than spaz, matter of fact.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, we had a blast at the road show.  Wait, this guy, Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  How you doing?  Great.  Turn that radio down.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was standing right next to the guy. 
[00:58:00]  As soon as the wood fell down to the floor and all the girls were gone on the side, somebody  screamed out, jump in.  And this guy took a flying straight into the pit.  And he didn't come up for a minute or so.  And so one of the bouncers came up and picked him up and realized he was all bloodied up.  And I didn't know what happened to the guy.  That's great.  Yeah.  It was a great show.  Cool.  What a dope.  It was a lot of fun.  Thank you, Steve.  Have a good one.  Syndication.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  Syndication when we hear what he was going to say. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That's it.  Don from East Meadow.  Steven Lynch and fuel kicked ass at the road show.  But Spaz looked like an AIDS-infested crackhead after the dunk tank.  Why couldn't you guys just drown him and make all our lives a lot happier?  Well, that dunk tank water, we didn't know.  The staff had put ice in it.  Yeah, they're not fans of Spaz either.  So they decided to put a ton of ice in the dunk tank before Spaz stepped into it.  I was wondering, because I was looking over.  We were quite a ways away. 
[00:59:00]  But on stage, you could see the dunk tank.  And every time Spaz went in, it looked like he was going to die.  Like he made this face like...  Like his face just contorted.  And he fell in and he couldn't get out fast enough.  And he was shivering.  Yeah.  It was pathetic.  It was pathetic.  His lips were blue, Anthony.  Blue.  Well, there's a bunch of...  Where do you want to start with the road show?  I mean, God.  Yeah.  We had over 2,000 people there. 
[00:59:30]  2,200, I guess, they're saying.  Yeah.  Was the official count for our road show.  So first of all, we want to thank everyone for supporting the show.  And I hope you all had a good time.  I was talking to Scott Colombo.  He goes, I was just part of the largest bachelor party ever.  That's what it amounted to.  It was just a huge bachelor party.  We should call the Guinness Book of World Records.  We might have thrown the biggest bachelor party last Thursday.  Were there any bachelors there?  Yeah, there were a few.  There were a few, Anthony. 
[01:00:00]  Well, first off, if you left town early or you didn't hear the show or you weren't at the road show,  there's a couple things you could do.  There's 120 pictures from our road show at www.com in the Opian Anthony section.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Wow.  I only went through about 50 of them.  No, he's up to 120.  Well, nice.  Those are still pictures.  And let's be honest, most of them PG rated.  Yeah.  The good stuff.  I mean, the stuff on NAW.com is very nice and all that.  But the good stuff is at foundrymusic.com. 
[01:00:30]  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  That's the unofficial Opian Anthony website.  Steve has, I don't even know, like 30 or 40 video clips, Anthony.  Yeah, he's got a lot of stuff.  He's got a video clip of Fuel singing Baby Raper live in front of 2,000 people.  He's got a clip of him singing Camp Concentration.  Your Brother's Singing Old Mind Fury.  Horny for Little Girls is a clip of that.  Yeah.  He hasn't even gotten the Stephen Lynch stuff up there yet.  He's still going through videotape. 
[01:01:00]  He has seven hours of videotape.  That's what he says, seven hours.  We're only there for a couple cameras going at the same time.  Okay.  Ah.  I was doing the math real fast there.  Oh.  Thought you got me.  And he's only half through all the videotape, so there's going to be even more clips in the coming days.  But go to foundrymusic.com and see what you missed.  Incredible stuff.  Guy says, Stoner Matt, the road show was the biggest and best sausage fest I've ever been to.  Now, that's not entirely true.  No.  Out in the crowd were girls on shoulders showing their boobs. 
[01:01:30]  I was impressed by the female turnout.  Yeah.  Mulcahy's in Wontaw.  And that was a great road show.  1,400 people there.  I think there was five girls there.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  But at this last road show, there were definitely a lot more females.  Yeah.  Definitely.  And I think every single one of them showed their cans.  Isn't that so funny when guys are so interested in what we were wearing?  Like, this guy's abusing you.  And then, Don from East Meadow, was that Anthony's new Gap look since Wendy gave away all his dirtbag gear to the homeless? 
[01:02:00]  Yes, indeed.  That was my new groovy Gap khaki shorts.  What was he saying about me?  I don't know.  I read something about you with your sandals.  Like, somebody was giving you hell about that.  Tevis.  It's summer.  I just threw on Tevis.  How come we don't get any emails or calls from girls about what we look like and what we're dressed like, but the guys will chime right in.  What's the matter?  What's the matter, Don? 
[01:02:30]  I wasn't wearing something that you felt was sexy.  You know?  I mean, do I care what Don thinks I'm wearing?  Don, there were naked friggin' women the entire time we were on stage.  What the hell were you doing looking at my shorts?  You fag.  Ian from Hawthorne.  Did Old Dirty get any bitches at the road show, Anthony?  Is that Don on the instant feedback?  Where are those pictures?  Old Dirty did not get any snatch at the road show. 
[01:03:00]  No, no.  He behaved for once.  Old Dirty was molesting one of the dancers.  She didn't seem to mind, though.  Yeah, they're used to it.  It was just insane.  I mean, when at the end of the show, that one girl, what was her name with the wiffle ball bat?  Madison, our favorite Madison.  You might remember her from being here in the studio with the large carrot.  And the asparagus.  And the asparagus.  Let's just say she took a wiffle ball bat in front of a festival crowd. 
[01:03:30]  In front of 2,000 people.  I mean, Jesus.  That was the sickest reaction I've ever seen in my life.  Insane.  And then it's like just screaming at me going, dude, she's doing it.  She's doing it.  Oh, my.  Oh, my God.  I could not believe that that was going on.  I could not believe that she was taking a wiffle ball bat.  You know what was cool about that, though, was the buildup.  Because we weren't sure she was going to do it.  And then it was obvious she was going to do it.  And the place just lost it.  I thought we were going to have a riot. 
[01:04:00]  They were just losing it.  They're like, oh, no, she's not.  She's not.  She is.  Oh.  There she goes.  There was more nudity there.  It was just amazing.  Yeah.  Old Dirty's on the line.  Oh, D.  Old Dirty.  What up?  What up, baby?  We haven't seen you since the road show.  Yeah, man.  You're not calling from prison?  Nah, nah.  Yo, it's all good, man.  I'm keeping out the hands of the NYPD.  They got the hands full with all the crap that's going on.  Yeah. 
[01:04:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Yo, I behaved, yo.  Yeah, you behaved at the road show.  Yeah, man.  No complaints, right?  Nah.  Yo, this kid.  Norris?  Norris looked pissed, man.  Jeff Norris?  Yeah.  He's a judo champion.  You better watch out.  Yeah, why?  I was out of his way.  I don't know, man.  He looked upset, man.  I don't know what was up with that.  Yo, the show was slamming, right?  Yeah, it was great.  It was good, bro.  No doubt.  Yo, you heard somebody died in the foam bath?  They didn't die.  They didn't die.  It's like the rumor gets built up. 
[01:05:00]  Cut it out, man.  The guy's fine.  Yo, my man, P.R. told me, yo, after the foam dissipated, there was somebody knocked out.  I was like, what?  Yeah.  Well, he wasn't supposed to be in the foam.  What is he doing in the foam?  Yo, the girls were...  That was for the girls.  Yo, the girls were frolicking in the foam, kid.  Yeah.  It was off the meat rack, yo.  Oh, my goodness.  Did any of the video clips of the foam stuff make foundrymusic.com yet?  I don't think so.  I didn't see any myself, but...  You had to see it, man. 
[01:05:30]  It was crazy.  Yeah, it was a good time.  I'm glad you came and had fun, man.  Yeah, man.  No doubt.  The fans were...  The fans, bro.  You guys got a crazy fan base, man.  You could tell these people to do anything.  They'll do it, bro.  Yeah, I think we're running out of roadshows, unfortunately.  It's getting too off the hook.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  It's getting really insane.  We had 2,200 people there.  We thought 1,400 last time was huge.  Now we're up to 2,200.  I think it's time to move this whole shindig to a stadium.  Then we'd have to do it in a professional way.  Kenny from Bergen County. 
[01:06:00]  Does Anthony have a Budweiser in his hand in all of his baby pictures, too?  Yes.  Indeed.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  Wear the Cardinals hat?  It's a roadshow, for God's sake.  Yo, you saw Anthony?  Look like a little timey hill figure model that thing.  Hey, old Dirty.  Were you hungry after the show?  Did you go to Wendy's in Queens for a burger?  You went nowhere near there?  No, man.  Okay.  I was just wondering.  Anthony, let's see. 
[01:06:30]  Anthony, what was that scar on your leg?  Timmy from Brooklyn.  Boy, it was a minibike accident back when I was 14 years old.  They're noticing scars on your legs?  Yeah.  I've known you for seven years.  I didn't know you had a scar.  Frank from Jersey.  There was nothing worse.  Frank from Jersey.  There was nothing worse than Anthony's chicken legs.  Frank.  Frank, there were chicks up there.  Asses.  Girls sitting on wiffle ball bats.  What?  Oh, bro.  Did I show up at a Chippendales place? 
[01:07:00]  Like I was trying to strut my stuff?  No, it's a roadshow.  There's naked chicks.  Oh, man.  I guess I should have worn long pants, Ovi.  Yo.  Now, long pants wasn't the...  I thought it was going to be a lot hotter, man.  Can you see every painful detail of my muscular physique?  So, what do you think of my tight pants?  Oh, brother.  Look it up there.  You guys rocked it, kid. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, I don't even...  That was fun, man.  No, but Opie.  I don't even...  I don't even remember being there.  Brother, you looked me at death that day, kid.  I was really sick.  Because someone's on line one.  Why didn't Opie drink?  Because I was...  Well, I don't drink as much as that to begin with.  But I was under some heavy antibiotics, man.  I was in rough shape Thursday.  Man, you walked in.  You look like...  Yeah, I know.  You rolled in with the Hertz waiting for you in the back, kid.  Yeah, I wasn't happening at all.  But I still had a great time because the energy there was incredible. 
[01:08:00]  The girlies were just ripping off tops, though, right?  It was unbelievable, the amount of nudity.  Yo, you know why I think Jeff Norris was pissed?  Why?  Because I borrowed a Sharpie.  You borrowed a Sharpie?  Yeah, for some reason.  I mean, you know, the friends are,  oh, let me get your autograph, this and that.  I was like, you know, let me oblige the Opie and Anthony faithful.  You know what I'm saying?  Word.  Yo, and then he came back.  He says, yo, dirty, where's my Sharpie at? 
[01:08:30]  And I go, yo, dude, I lost it.  Yo, he grabbed my arm in such a way that, like, my whole body just froze.  I'm like, yo, wait a minute, B.  I got $250 right here.  I will go buy you a marker, bro.  Chill.  That's funny.  Yeah, you don't want to have it with him, man.  You're a big boy.  He is, man.  All right, bro.  All right, baby.  I'll talk to you soon, O.G.  You guys be good.  Hey.  Peace.  Well, that's a first.  So, Dirty showed up at one of our road shows  and was able to call up the next day because he wasn't incarcerated.  Right. 
[01:09:00]  Rob Z from Westbury.  Hey, O&A.  Fuel was wild, and you guys had the hottest girls on stage.  Spaz looked like a wet rat on crack.  I got to say, I think one of the highlights of the road show  was definitely Fuel singing Baby Raper with 2,000 people singing along.  The crowd singing along.  It was amazing.  They knew all the words.  They're just singing Baby Raper.  Yeah.  There's like a 30-second clip of that on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  Rob from Brooklyn.  I just looked through the pictures on the WNW website  because we had them on a bunch of our websites.  If that's PG rated, you need to go over the movie rating guidelines. 
[01:09:30]  Ouch.  Oh, really?  I can't wait to see the unofficial site when I get home.  The damn company put it on the blocked sites list.  Ah.  No, I'm telling you.  I mean, the pictures at WNW.com are good,  but they're tame compared to what Steve at foundrymusic.com has.  Who else do we want to talk to?  Let's go to Johnny Elvis.  Johnny Elvis, what's up?  Hey, Ovi.  How are you?  How you doing, Anthony?  Hey.  How you doing, bud? 
[01:10:00]  Up front there, when you guys were,  I tell you, the whole show was unbelievable.  I just want to thank you guys.  You can't even put it into words.  I'm speechless, baby.  Are you still drunk from Thursday, Johnny?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man, I get it.  One thing.  Remember when you were up?  When I was up here?  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Cut our losses there, huh?  Mike.  Mike DeMone checking in.  The guy that died from the foam in the... 
[01:10:30]  Is he the same guy that pulled the knife on Mr. Hand?  There you go.  No guy died in our road show.  The rumors, Anthony.  The rumors.  Dan from Seaford.  I think Psycho Mark moved up to number five on the FBI's most wanted list after the crap  he pulled at the road show.  What was he doing at the road show?  He was a nut, man.  Was he?  Yeah.  You see him, he's like humping the girls.  He was jumping in the foam.  He had guys doing burnouts in front of the club. 
[01:11:00]  I don't know what he was doing.  All I know is some chick handed me a bag of weed that looked like it was grown on Venus.  I don't know what the hell this weed...  I haven't smoked pot in probably 15 years.  And I know a lot of things have changed over 15 years, but I never thought pot could change  that much.  It looked like some kind of dilithium crystals were on it or something.  I don't know what it was, but I just smelt it and got high. 
[01:11:30]  But, you know, I don't smoke pot.  Yeah.  So, ooh, who am I going to give this to?  Gee, maybe the guy that does the anti-drug spots on NAW.  Yeah.  I'll give him to Psycho Mark.  And there was a real joint in there.  I'm like, I can't deal with this.  I give it to Mark.  I go, Mark, whatever you want to do with it.  Throw it away, whatever.  I got a good story, too.  That girl handed us the pot when we were outside the club, just in a bag, right, Anthony?  And we both gave our pot away to people that would enjoy it. 
[01:12:00]  So at the end of the night, I'm getting into a car to go home, and that woman runs over  again and says, Opie, you forgot your pot.  The guy who drove me home was a New York City police officer for 23 years, Anthony.  Yeah.  So I looked her right in the eye and said, no, I didn't.  You forgot your pot.  Right in front of the guy.  Spent 23 years on the force.  Yeah.  I think he understands. 
[01:12:30]  Chris, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Pretty good, man.  I just want to say that that thing was the wildest, most off-the-hook party I've ever been to in my life.  Yeah, that was a party, man.  Yo, man, that was insane.  It really was.  The crowd was nuts.  It just got out of hand.  The wet t-shirt contest alone lasted almost two hours.  And it was sick.  I mean, the different boobs we saw, Opie.  The girls that you wanted on stage and the girls you wanted off stage.  Ugh.  It wasn't just boobs, guys. 
[01:13:00]  No, I know.  It was amazing.  No, it was just boobs.  I just, it was just boobs.  We want to do this again.  It was just boobs.  Yeah, just boobs.  But I don't understand why some of you guys are throwing toilet paper up on the stage.  Well, there was that one girl we were screaming snack or two at.  Yeah.  You know who started that chant?  My brother in the front row.  We were going insane.  I missed half the songs because we were just yelling at all the chicks around us to take  the top off.  I know.  I know. 
[01:13:30]  At one point, you know, Ed and I are trying to do some pretty good creative stuff on stage  and you guys are like turning around and just looking at girls flashing like, whatever.  Let's just get the girls up on stage and let them out.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You guys are great, but get the girls on stage.  That's what we all wanted.  That's it.  And you guys got it.  I do got to say one thing.  Yeah.  Is that Sandy taking pictures for the website?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  She's amazing.  How did you end up with that project?  I don't know.  Sometimes I think about that myself. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, my God.  Cool.  Oh, man.  All right, guys.  I just hope to thank you for a great kickoff this summer.  And you guys undid her top.  Did they?  Yeah.  It's like, oh, my God.  Like, we didn't give you enough boobs and cash.  You have to go after my chick.  Oh, my God.  No, she's amazing.  What do you want?  Thanks, Chris.  All right, man.  All right.  Have a good one.  Thanks for a great summer.  All right, cool.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Carlos, Opie, did Sandy mind you wearing her sandals?  Shut up.  They just...  Like, there's no guys out there wearing Tevis at all, right? 
[01:14:30]  I heard some guy got shot by a gangster at your road show.  Is that true?  Oh, boy.  No, it's not true.  O&A.  This is Frank from Manhattan.  I unfortunately was listening from my office on Thursday.  I couldn't make it, but loved it.  When the crowd was singing Baby Raper with Fuel, I was dying laughing.  It sounded like a pedophile's Woodstock.  Great show, Frank. 
[01:15:00]  All right, we're just getting started.  Keep the cop.  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  We do have to take a quick break.  Yeah.  More of your calls about the road show.

If you want to get the brand-new WOW stickers.  Oh, my God. 
[01:15:30]  Did you see that?  I missed this place.  I missed that.  He is just a morrow.  What was that?  He almost frigging split his head open.  He ripped the carpet up.  He ripped the carpet up?  He went to turn around and run out the door so fast, he ripped the carpet up and almost fell into the door.  Bravo.  Jesus, man.  All right, get your brand-new WOW stickers today with Psycho Mark.

The Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Anthony.  You think I was going in the air and make a complete baboon of myself?  Anthony.  My tampon is sitting a little askew today.  Anthony.  Who helped?  Anthony. 
[01:18:00]  Anthony.  Anthony.  20 girls want to bang me.  20 girls want to bang me.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 on WNEW.  Opie, Gay Marco checking in from the village.  Says, hey, Anthony, I need my Gap shorts back.  You people.  You bunch of smart asses.  Check out pick 116 on the NAW site from the roadshow. 
[01:18:30]  Anthony looks like the biggest effing homo.  Oh, there you go.  Timmy from Brooklyn.  Thank you.  Yes, I am the biggest effing homo.  With all the chicks around Anthony, you've noticed Anthony.  Very good.  Very good.  I wouldn't even have been looking at me for a second.  Right.  What are you, crazy?  My God, I looked at over 200 pictures from the roadshow, and I'm in just about every one of them.  I didn't even look at myself.  MX checking in.  I heard from this guy that Anthony got into a gunfight with some gangsters in the bathroom over a bag of pot. 
[01:19:00]  Is that true?  No, more rumors.  More rumors.  A lot of rumors coming out of our roadshow.  The best part of the roadshow happened on the Bell Parkway, where my friend Stone and Matt saw Anthony and tried to have a conversation doing 75 miles per hour.  I had to grab the wheel to keep from crashing.  Is that one true?  Yes.  That is true.  He doesn't say that after that, I sped away. 
[01:19:30]  I left the roadshow and went right to Boston, man.  Yeah, I know you did.  Ah, no better way to drive than drunk.  No, I wasn't driving.  Everyone thought you had an attitude, because I was hanging and signing and stuff, and like, where's Anthony?  I had to get up to Boston.  Urgent business only I could solve.  We were up there for the river rave.  We talked about that earlier.  It was great.  Sean from Staten Island.  Stephen Lynch absolutely stole that in show.  Yeah, he was great. 
[01:20:00]  He definitely was great.  Once again, there's going to be clips of Stephen Lynch's performance on foundrymusic.com.  The FBA, the EP version.  Yeah.  Extended play.  Yeah, it was great.  Foundry Steve hasn't gone through all the videotape yet, so there's going to be a ton of clips going up in the next couple of days.  Jared from Baldwin.  I got Madison's shirt that she threw at the crowd.  I was in the second row.  It smells just like a hot girl, and it's framed on my wall for all my friends and family to see. 
[01:20:30]  El Franco from Yorktown.  O&A.  I'm 14, and I just wanted to thank you and Steve from the website for delivering me some boobs and videos from your roadshow.  Damn it, rules being around these days.  Thanks again, guys.  Wow.  Come on.  Opie the Gladiator checking in from Rome.  He needs his sandals back.  He has a gig at the Coliseum Saturday.  Easy.  The Gladiator. 
[01:21:00]  I'm the only one that wears Tevez.  Okay.  That's pretty funny.  Oh, yeah, and I'm the only one that wears shorts.  Please.  I never wear shorts either.  Eric from Rockaway Park.  Roadshow rocked.  Opie drinks like a girl while Anthony was pounding them down.  I am a wimp.  I'll be the first to admit that, but I had like two beers the whole day.  I was very out of the way.  Jesus.  I heard someone at the roadshow ate some Pop Rocks and drank soda and died. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, my God.  What's great about this radio show?  We don't even have to come up with material anymore.  We just have to read the stuff you guys said.  You guys are saying.  Dave from Linenhurst.  Anthony, are you going to be in that new movie Chicken Run?  Oh, thanks, Gabe Marco from Brooklyn.  There's nothing wrong with wearing sandals. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, boy.  Let's go to the phones.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I just had a question.  Yeah.  About the roadshow and the stuff that was going on on the stage.  Yeah.  How is it that you guys, like, don't get into trouble with, like, sex laws and stuff?  I mean, like, Jim Morrison used to get dragged off the stage because people thought he might have shown his penis.  Well, we don't show any penis.  You guys have, like, wiffle ball bats. 
[01:22:30]  Well, we don't show any penis.  Yeah, the difference is keep the penis in the pants.  Right.  The second a penis comes out, people start getting mad.  What cop is going to say, hey, there's a problem on that stage, unless it is penis?  Well, yeah, that's true.  But, I mean, like, basically, all those places in New York have been completely shut down.  I mean, girls can't even show their boobs at any place.  You know, they used to be.  I just want to know how many people got arrested trying to pick up their pictures that they took from the roadshow. 
[01:23:00]  Chris, it's a plain and simple answer.  Opie and Anthony are above the law.  We are above the law.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Let's go to Marianne, one of the ladies that was at the roadshow.  Marianne, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Great.  They all got to get off you.  You guys looked fine.  Why?  Because you weren't in ripped up ACDC t-shirts and ripped jeans and broken Adidas's?  Please.  That's what I changed into.  You guys looked great.  And you did. 
[01:23:30]  You did.  And it was a lot of fun.  I wish I would have been able to stay longer, but I had to go home.  Cool.  Yeah.  But it was really good.  And I got some more stoves any time you guys are ready.  You're the one that gave us the pot and almost got us screwed?  Thank you.  What?  No, that wasn't me.  See?  No, the cigars.  Oh, cigars.  Oh, it's cigars.  Okay.  Oh, I know.  Hi, Marianne.  Is this true?  Rob from Queens Checking.  And I heard Anthony was selling pot, and the guy thought he was getting ripped off.  So, Opie, crack the guy in the head with a bat, and you hid the dead body in the foam. 
[01:24:00]  No, I don't think that's completely accurate.  No.  Let's go to Jared.  Jared, what's up?  Yeah, I just want to let you guys know that I'm officially banned from any future roadshows.  What happened?  Originally, I've been listening to you guys since the beginning, and my wife has always hated you.  And I finally turned around to you guys within the last few months.  And it was her idea to go.  So, we got there nice and early, got up in the front of the line, waiting in line. 
[01:24:30]  Finally get in, grab my beers, head right for the front.  She decides she wants to sit down in the back, but we can't see a thing.  So, I convinced her to get up a little closer.  I mean, we're hanging out.  And then once all the girls started showing up and taking off their tops, I pretty much forgot my wife was there.  Well, that tends to happen.  Yeah.  So, what's the problem?  She didn't like that too much.  So, she told me, from now on, I'm not allowed to go to any roadshows. 
[01:25:00]  Well, that kind of sucks.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, she, not only that, but she dragged me out of there about two seconds before the wet t-shirt contest.  That lasted for like two hours, Jared.  That ain't right.  So, all right, thank you.  All right, take it easy, bye.  Take that pass as far.  Hey, thanks for the TNA show.  The wiffle ball bat rules.  Rudy Giuliani.  Checking in from New York.  I guess he enjoyed the roadshow.  Let's go to Drew.  Drew, what's up? 
[01:25:30]  Yo, what's up, Dale?  What's going on, guys?  How are you?  Yo, that was the friggin' Bombers of the Bombs show, boy.  Let me tell you.  Did you guys notice that was cloudy all day?  All of a sudden, it was the wet t-shirt contest.  And the sun came out.  God wanted to see it.  God is my savior.  I saw the messiah, man.  Yeah.  God wanted to see it.  That thing was friggin' awesome, man.  Great party, guys.  Seriously.  They only get better and better.  That's the crazy thing about that.  Dude, I'm going to the next one.  Next time I'm bringing my girl with me, the friggin' wow, we're the friggin' double D's over there.  Oh, cool.  I want to thank all the ladies that did show up more than usual. 
[01:26:00]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  It was great, guys.  Send the case when Earl turns white.  All right, bye.  Later, guys.  Kevin, you're next on AEW.  How are you?  Hey, how's it going?  Great.  What's up?  Yeah, I was at that road show.  I'm telling you, I think it was the Kittner boy that ended up in the foam.  We're not going to go into that foam and watch that little Kittner boy spill out all over the floor.  He had doll's eyes.  Life is eyes like a doll's eye.  I think the foam guy checked in, right? 
[01:26:30]  He's okay?  Yeah, foam guy from the foam.  And it said, ow, this hurts.  It still hurts or whatever.  It still hurts.  I heard the Beatles were at the road show.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Beatles checked in.  All the rumors.  My God.  I was told your old boss, Gary, made a surprise appearance at the road show and started throwing ice cream cones at everybody.  Yeah, it was sick.  I've got to thank everybody that performed.  It was kind of cool. 
[01:27:00]  We were in the backstage area.  Did we have a backstage area?  Yeah, it was kind of a room.  A little room.  Okay.  A little bar and stuff.  It was pretty cool.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, a guy comes up to me.  It's like, hey, what's up?  I go, hey, how you doing?  He goes, I'm fuel.  I was like, oh, my God, fuel.  Dude, this is fuel.  I go, oh, you know what this is?  It's fuel.  It's fuel.  Baby break.  He's a pretty funny guy, too.  We were talking before the show. 
[01:27:30]  Uh-huh.  And he's like funny.  I guess you can't write a song like that without being funny or psychopathic or something like that.  Psychotic.  But, yeah, he's a funny guy.  We have fun.  I heard your old boss's promotion guy, Roger, made a surprise appearance at the road show and attempted to steal the amplifier.  I got to admit, we did wimp out at our road show, though. 
[01:28:00]  Why?  We should explain.  Q had another song to do.  For the first time, Ed and I were scared for our lives.  You know, Q sings that offensive song, Imagine.  Yeah.  That starts off, imagine there are no...  I got it from a Negro.  Oh, yeah, you get the point.  So he's ready to perform.  He's up on stage looking very Italian and stuff.  He got all dressed up for his song and stuff. 
[01:28:30]  And then Ed and I and Rick and Ben, we all look at each other and we're like, oh, maybe this isn't a good idea now that everyone's hammered.  And there's a lot of black people in the audience.  Yeah.  They could have a problem with this next song.  Yeah, we didn't want to start any race riots.  Oh, no.  So we did chicken out and said, look, Q, you know, you sounded great on horny for little girls, but I don't think it would be a good idea.  And then he was, like, thankful.  I think he felt like, I have to do this song. 
[01:29:00]  I don't want to do it, but I have to.  I'm here.  I'm dressed up.  Yeah.  So let's go to Donna.  Donna, you're next on N.E.W.  That's me.  How are you?  Okay.  How you doing, babe?  Great.  Just want to say thank you for having a great party.  I had a kick-ass time.  Mm-hmm.  When I turn off my radio.  Yeah, do that.  Definitely do that.  Greetings from the throne.  Yes.  But you had a good time at the road show.  Excellent time.  Excellent time.  And I would encourage all the women out there, we've got to stand up. 
[01:29:30]  We need to stick together.  Come out to the next one.  Yeah.  Vaginas.  Definitely.  Vaginas.  I've got to say hello to Keith and PR.  Chatting with them for a while.  Ah, yes.  Yeah.  And I hope you did look kind of down, but we understand you were sick.  No, I was really sick.  So we're letting you slide this time.  I was really sick.  I'm much better today, actually.  I shouldn't complain too much.  Thank you, Donna.  And say hello to Sandy, too.  I will.  We love you guys.  Oh, thank you. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  Bye-bye now.  Bye-bye.  I heard Hitler showed up and sung backup on All Mine Fewer at the road show.  There's over 30 files at this point, Anthony, on foundrymusic.com for the road show.  All right, who else do we have to go to here?  Stinky saved my wife's life at road show?  No.  Come on.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  How did this drama unfold?  All right.  Yeah, my wife was up there jigging on little things, but while she was in the foam pit, 
[01:30:30]  foam got into her eyes that she couldn't really see too well.  And Stinky, fortunately, was standing right there and helped her out.  She couldn't see too well, and he was kind enough to let her wipe her eyeballs out on  her shirt.  And I want to appreciate that.  What a guy.  He probably got the feel.  Well, I wouldn't be surprised, but I can't blame him.  You know, it's a little hottie.  Yeah.  And, hey, I want to thank you because after that whole thing, I want to open up my relationship 
[01:31:00]  a hell of a lot better.  Oh, very good.  Oh, very good.  Cool.  Hey, by the way, we had to leave a little early after that.  Who won the wet t-shirt contest?  Who cares?  I don't even know, to be honest.  You don't even know?  I don't know.  I don't care.  I don't think it was about that at the end.  It really wasn't.  It turned into something completely different, didn't it?  Yes, it did.  Yeah, I just want to give props to Sinky.  All right.  Not too bad of a bad guy.  Cool. 
[01:31:30]  And that's Spaz.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I think someone's saying Spaz looked like a German SS trooper in his uniform, in his  Boy Scout uniform.  Yeah.  He does.  He looks like a Hitler youth.  Let's go to Q.  Is this the Q?  Q, how are you doing, guys?  Hey.  I'm horny for little girls.  Good.  You know, thinking back, I'm kind of sorry we didn't do that song.  Oh, really?  Man.  We should have just went for it.  I don't know.  And I looked at you, you looked at us, and it was like, we were definitely a little scared  on that stage.  Like, I don't know if this is a good idea. 
[01:32:00]  Well, there was one dude standing off to the side.  That was as big as a house.  Yeah.  Over to the right.  That was the guy we saw.  And he was 10 feet away from us, no people in between.  I'm like, you guys are nuts.  Yeah.  He was definitely checking me out.  Not to mention, there were a couple of, like, real Italians hanging out in the back  that were checking me out before I went on, too.  As a matter of fact, those guys were actually getting me more nervous.  That was Joey DBD.  Yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Anyway.  But I have some logic here.  I think I would have to proclaim myself the winner of the Most Offensive Song Contest  because my song was actually too offensive to play.  It was so offensive, we couldn't even play it live.  You know, you might have a point.  Exactly.  As a matter of fact, I think I probably would have offended many people if I did that.  It just shows that A and I are a bunch of pussies when you take these microphones away  from us and we're live.  Because, man, if we were in a studio, we would have let you play it. 
[01:33:00]  Who cares?  Yeah.  But live like that, it was scary.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, with the crowd pressed up against the stage like that, you never  know what could happen.  Yeah.  Yeah, they were ready to take the stage.  Take the stage, yeah.  Burn it like Woodstock.  Right.  And my girlfriend, I kind of told the clue to her into what was going to go on when we  got there.  And when she saw what was going on while I was doing that song, she was like, my God.  And I said, I didn't lie to you.  I told you this was going to happen. 
[01:33:30]  But, yeah, it was cool, guys.  It was definitely the most fun I've had in a while.  All right on, man.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Thank you.  Talk to you soon.  I've got to clear up some more rumors that are going around.  A lot of rumors from this road show.  No, I wasn't seen making out with Robin Givens at a New York City night spot after the road  show.  No, JonBenet Ramsey was not the winner of the wet t-shirt contest.  This might be true, though.  That was me that fell in the foam.  I just wanted to tell everyone I was okay. 
[01:34:00]  Fifteen stitches of small price to pay for soapy boobage.  Rick Lazio.  Rick Lazio.  Very good.  Well, Steve from New York is a true Rick Lazio fell into the foam and just tripped during  the parade to cover up the injury.  There you go.  Jeff from Oceanside.  What's up, guys?  The road show at South Beach was a nude high school reunion.  No joke.  I graduated with Jenna, Kelly, and Shannon from the wet t-shirt contest.  I didn't bang them in high school, but at least now I saw their fun bags.  You guys were all...  Oh, man. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, debauchery.  Pandemonium.  Let's see what else we can do here.  There's just tons of stuff going on.  Matt?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  How are you?  Hey, the road show rocked, guys.  Yeah, that was something.  Listen, I just got to thank the police officer that pulled me over on the way back from the  show.  I guess I was speeding a little bit on the GWB, but I told him I was coming from the road  show, and after he cleared me that I wasn't drunk or stoned, he said he was in 0 and 8th 
[01:35:00]  and he was going to let me go.  It was my lucky day.  You were at the road show and you weren't drunk or stoned?  Well, this was a lot later, so I was pretty good by then.  Were you sick, too?  But the funniest thing was, as I was pulling away, I hear the loudspeaker, the squad car  come up, and I hear, okay, terrific.  Oh, cool, Matt.  Yeah, it rocks, guys.  Listen, syndication on Madison can take the whole bat.  All right, thank you.  Later.  Bye.  More rumors coming in.  No, it was not Opie on the back of a wave runner with Ricky Martin during commercials. 
[01:35:30]  I said it wasn't.  Adrian.  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  You're a black guy?  Yeah.  It just matters for what we're talking about.  That's the only reason.  Okay, go ahead.  You made that comment about being afraid to play the offensive song about the blacks.  Come on, guys.  What's the story?  I'm being honest.  I was a little nervous.  Wait, wait.  Check out the psychology.  We like the show.  We listen to the show.  We come to the road show.  No, no, no, no.  Wait, wait.  Let me correct you, though.  I wasn't nervous about our black listeners, and there were a bunch of them there. 
[01:36:00]  I was more worried about, like, the black bouncers and stuff that might not get the show.  Well, I...  See, that's where I thought the problem was.  I figure you come to the road show.  I don't care if you're Jewish, black, whatever.  You understand the show.  You're there.  You're going to check it out.  I was worried about people like the bouncers and stuff that I don't know if they listen to us or another radio station.  Hey, it just goes down to, like, game psychology.  There's more of us than them.  So what were they going to do?  I mean, don't be afraid.  You guys are kicking butt.  Don't be afraid to do your thing. 
[01:36:30]  I mean, if people are into it, they're going to be into it.  That's all.  It was more about the people that might be there just working and don't know our show that I was worried about.  Forget about the political correctness.  Play the songs.  All right, man.  All right?  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  I was a little leery about that one myself.  Hmm.  Oh, this is true.  I heard that the girl Chyna was so upset that she didn't make the cut for the wet t-shirt contest that she, well, she didn't punch me, that she punched open the face.  Is that true? 
[01:37:00]  No, but she went after me.  She did?  She was all pissed.  Chyna, the black stripper, she was pissed that she didn't make the cut for the wet t-shirt contest.  So after the show, after we, you know, poured our blood and sweat on that stage, had a great time.  She's yelling and screaming at me after the road show.  Screaming.  And then went after me, and I think it was Big Cabrera someone that just stepped in between us.  I'm like, what the hell is that about?  It was the crowd that was deciding who was moving on.  Yeah.  Yeah, we didn't know.  And then she said I dissed her on stage or something, said something crazy. 
[01:37:30]  What's her job?  Rich from Union.  I lost my virginity at the road show.  Ken from Connecticut.  Is it true Eddie Van Halen got cancer at the road show?  I heard Opie was sick because the giant mosquito came and stung him, and then the FBI sprayed him with DDT.  Let's go to Billy Mack.  He's got his two cents on the road show.  Billy Mack.  Hey.  Jay Moore's bud.  What's going on, man?  What's going on, guys? 
[01:38:00]  Great, great show, man.  Yeah.  How about that second verse by Mike DiNicola there?  Oh, that was brilliant.  The full version of FBA.  We finally heard it.  Those guys are really intelligent, man.  They put that together pretty much in my van on the way out there.  I don't know if you know that.  I wouldn't be surprised knowing Mike and Stephen Lynch.  Listen, that was a good call about playing that other offensive song because I tell you,  some of those big black guys, they had something to do behind the stage there, man.  They were kicking some ass on some people back there.  Well, yeah.  They were trying to do their job and keep it under control, you know? 
[01:38:30]  No, no.  I'm not saying they weren't.  It was great.  But, you know, you never know.  They might not have really known the show, so they might not have got the, you know,  the joke of it.  Cool.  Yeah.  What do you think about tomorrow's game?  Knicks?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  What did I say?  I know you did.  Knicks are a better team without Ewing.  I couldn't wait to say that again.  They have won five playoff games against the Pacers without Ewing at this point.  Five.  Absolutely.  In the last few years.  Yeah.  The last two years, I think.  Huh?  I think, yeah.  You're five and one, I think, without them. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  And they look great.  And it's simple because they're a running offense and they run a lot better without Ewing  in the lineup.  Yep.  Yep.  Pacers weren't even in that game.  They got some goddamn gazelles in that team.  We don't need Ewing lumbering behind.  Yeah.  It's like, get the ball and let's get up the court.  Great.  What about Sprewell playing with a damn broken toe?  Awesome.  And then when Cammie came off the bench, Thomas stepped up.  It was great.  Even Chris Dudley played good.  The white guy.  That's impossible.  And the white guy played well.  Not great, but he played well. 
[01:39:30]  All right, guys.  Listen, maybe we'll see you tomorrow, huh?  All right.  Where are you going to be?  You know where.  Yeah.  We might check out the game there.  Cool.  All right, cool.  All right, Billy.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Well, Ewing was the hero last week and now he's just a piece of crap again, hoping.  He's always a, you know how I feel about Ewing.  Well, if you said that last week, you got pounded by the fans that said he's the only  reason they're in.  Well, he played great against Miami.  What can I tell you?  Rumor has it, Patrick Ewing's injuries sustained in the foam pit. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  We're just about done with the road show.  We'll move on to other things.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I was numero uno, first guy on line for the road show.  Uh-huh.  Took the day off of work.  Get down there, about quarter after nine in the morning.  Places that's lit up down there, even before any NW guys were down there.  I'm sitting on line, just me and my wife, sitting there, got my water gun, just in case  anything goes down.  And this producer guy arrives and he comes over to me. 
[01:40:30]  He's like, hey, what's your name?  My name's Chris.  He's like, what are you doing now?  I'm like, I'm waiting to, you know, get into the ONA show.  He's like, you want to help build a stage?  I was like, yeah, okay.  Very nice.  Very nice.  I've got to play with the ball in it.  So I helped build a stage.  I put the water in Spaz's dunk tank, right?  And this referee guy comes over and it's his dunk tank. 
[01:41:00]  And I think, you know, when I was done, you know, somebody, he'd be there to work the  tank.  Well, he wasn't there.  So I had to wind up running Spaz's dunk tank.  Rumor killer number one, there was no ice.  I said there's been two hours filling the thing with a hose.  There was no ice.  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  I said to the guy, to the people, they should throw some ice in it.  But it was already freezing enough.  And after all this, after all this work, I didn't even get a freaking sticker. 
[01:41:30]  What's up with that?  Very nice.  Very nice.  Sucks to be you.  I don't know.  I put in my parts for the show.  You can't have to.  All right.  All right.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Okay.  Terrific.  We always take one too many calls.  I was napping.  Steve.  Hey, guys. 
[01:42:00]  How are you?  Great.  I couldn't go to the road trip.  I went away for the weekend.  Yeah.  And on Saturday afternoon, listening to BCN.  Up in Boston?  I was going to hear Anthony's voice.  Yeah.  I was going to hear Anthony's voice.  Yes.  So on behalf of all my friends and family back home, I was wondering what the story is  of the syndication and why you guys were on up there.  We're making nice.  We were on the radio all weekend up there.  They had their huge river rave with Stone Temple Pilots and Filter and Godsmack and Cypress  Hill and it was amazing and we were invited and we had a great time and we were all on 
[01:42:30]  the radio.  I had to tune out shortly after that, so I missed, I guess, over here still caught in  traffic, Anthony said, but everybody's excited to have you guys back on up there.  Yeah.  We got to announce Stone Temple Pilots to a crowd of 60,000 this past Saturday.  It was amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  Well, I'll pass on the good news to the guys.  All right, Steve.  Take care.  Thank you.  Yes.  We kind of went over that earlier.  It was a great time.  Yeah.  All right, Anthony.  Let's take a break. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  People wondering if Rick introduced Loverboy at the road show.  Rumor.  Just a rumor.  Just a rumor.  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen won the wet t-shirt contest.  Rumor?  Uh, secondly.  Dan, they're 14.  What?  The Olsen twins are 14.  Yeah.  We're getting close.  We're waiting.  Four more years.  Legal threesome with the Olsen twins.  I was, uh, I was treated to the Olsen twins on, uh, I know. 
[01:43:30]  You're going to laugh.  Rosie?  I, I, but I saw Olsen twins.  I'm like, I'm checking out.  Look, how are they looking?  What do you, they got nubs?  They're getting there.  They, they got little nubs.  They're ripening.  A couple more years.  Yeah.  Before you know it.  Butt sex.  Yeah.  Olsen twins.  Vaginas.  14.  Mm, stick it in my mouth.  What?  What? 
[01:44:00]  What, what, what, what?  Butt sex.  Mm, stick it in my mouth.  Okay, terrific.  I hope they're not dumping out of that, because that doesn't mean anything.  I don't know what that is.  Ah, man, this is so intense.  All right, Carmen, relax there.  Yeah, so what are they looking like?  They're, are they shaping up?  They're shaping up.  Let's just do it that way.  They have little training bras and stuff.  Ah, the Olsen twins. 
[01:44:30]  All right, I'll, I'll do an impression for you, Anthony.  What am I feeling?  Oh, okay, good.  I love the visual impression.  Well, you could explain it for everybody.  All right.  That's good with the voices.  I'm good with the visual impressions.  Let's see.  Let's see.  What do you got?  This is my impression of the Olsen twins' boobs.  Okay.  I'm going to be standing up, grabbing a handful of his boob, and squeezing it into a little  coney nub on his chest. 
[01:45:00]  They're at that size right now.  That's the stage they're at.  Thank you.  Where it's just all nipples?  Just all nip?  It's just the Olsen twins.  Oh, my God.  All right, Anthony.  Hey, can we talk about how bad Mission Impossible 2 was?  Evil kid from the city.  Yeah, why don't we talk, well, you got a good story about Mission Impossible, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why don't we get into that next, Anthony?  We've got to take a quick break. 
[01:45:30]  More of your phone calls.  John checking in, finally, on this whole thing.  Ant wasn't wearing shorts.  It's just that Wendy took half his pants.  That's pretty good.  All right, so the road show, you know, was great.  Lots of pictures at www.com.  Those pictures, they're great, but they're tame compared to what's on the unofficial Opium  Anthony website, which is foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Steve has 30 clips up, and he's only halfway through the videotapes. 
[01:46:00]  Halfway through.  So he's going to be putting up new material for the rest of the week, I would imagine, okay?  Yes.  And also, Ant, before we go to break, real fast, we're doing another WOW sticker stop today.  Psychomark, as we speak, is hanging out at Strauss Discount Auto, East 14th Street at Avenue C.  And he'll be there for another hour, it looks like, handing out the brand new WOW sticker.  So if you're in the area, stop by and say hi, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Mission Impossible 2, Anthony's Review, and what happened to him at the theater when we get back. 
[01:46:30]  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, the Diamond Exchange.  Yes, yes, no time better than now to get engaged.  It's spring.  Love is in the air, Opie.

[01:47:30]  What did someone do?  There's a picture.  I mean, even the show is taking out all the pictures for the Roadshow.  We're on the www.com site right now.  That's a good one.  And there's a picture of Anthony Budweiser at hand holding a huge sign that just says butt sex.  That's pretty bad.  Thanks, guys.  I'm sure someone will lift the picture and put $5 underneath it. 
[01:48:00]  Well, Anthony was taking some of the many signs.  There were hundreds of signs.  I'm showing them to the crowd.  And I get hung out to dry.  You are hung out to dry in that picture.  That's a good one.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The Diamond Exchange, Route 17 North in Paramus, New Jersey.  Thank you.  Go ahead, Ed.  Are we done?  Yes.  We were?  Yes.  You gave out the phone number and everything?  1-800-550-0633, Opie.  Okay, very good.  We'll be back talking about what happened to Anthony when he was watching Mission Impossible. 
[01:48:30]  Trying to.  He had us cracking up in the office.  We'll get into it next.  And we're back.  212-757-1027.  It's the O&A Show.  I want to thank our listeners for the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen picture gallery  that they sent me.  Sick mother-heppard man.  Look, see?  What they look like now? 
[01:49:00]  This point in the little nubs that Opie showed what they looked like earlier.  But, uh, yeah.  And before you know it, yeah, there's like little Britney Spears-y things going on there.  And I got to say, you're taking some major hits on this radio show today.  Yeah, I understand.  Uh, Keith from Secret.  I finally heard something more contradictory than Psycho Mark reading anti-drug commercials.  Anthony reading for the Diamond Exchange.  And Vic from Merrick.  Where was Ant's Girl?  Oh, that's right.  You had to be 21 to get into the road show. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, she's 21.  Shut up.  I love that.  Not, she's over 21.  Hey, she's 21.  Anyone else pick up on that?  Okay, good.  Uh, Anthony.  Uh, yeah.  Mission Impossible 2.  Ah.  First of all, I'm very surprised that you would go see Mission Impossible 2.  Why?  Opening weekend.  Memorial Day weekend.  Yeah, well, I'm an ass.  What can I say? 
[01:50:00]  I wanted to go to the movie.  I wanted to see Mission Impossible 2.  I avoided the movie theaters like the plague, man.  Well, there wasn't really anything else I wanted to see.  I pretty much saw everything else.  You know?  Do you know, I saw a dinosaur.  You know, I want to see Mission Impossible 2.  I just hate going to the crowd of movie theaters.  And I thought maybe it would be a movie where, uh, I don't know, it would have an ending that would be effed up or something,  and the listeners ruin it for us now.  It's not even like we do anything to movies anymore.  The listeners, all of a sudden, I'll be scrolling through instant feedback, and bam, there's an end of a movie. 
[01:50:30]  I'm like, thanks.  They're getting us back from, uh, the Sixth Star Wars and Sixth Sense thing.  Sixth Sense thing.  But there's really no surprise thing in, uh, Mission Impossible.  Uh, overall, uh, I didn't really like the movie.  Uh, I didn't, I didn't get to enjoy, uh, the beginning of it.  I, I, I, I, you know, I might come off sounding a little, a little harsh here today, Opie.  Okay.  Sounding a little, uh, I don't know, politically incorrect.  Talk to us, Sam.  Talk to us. 
[01:51:00]  We're here for you.  I went to, uh, the Pavilion in Brooklyn, went to go see Mission Impossible 2, with, with savages.  I'm not ringing the bell.  I, I, I, I didn't know I was doing a radio show with Bob Grant today.  Savages.  I can't believe it anymore.  You, guffon, sfachim, savages.  Yeah.  This is me and my girlfriend trying to get out of the theater with our lives. 
[01:51:30]  Quick, through the air duct.  They're chasing us with knives.  Opie.  Unbelievable.  How come you can't go to a movie anymore without black people and Hispanic people losing their effing minds?  Okay, I said it.  I said it.  Look, Stinky's freaking out.  Even Spaz thinks I'm being a little much. 
[01:52:00]  I'm turning off the music.  I'm going to carefully put my headphones down.  I'm going to tiptoe out of the studio.  What, what, what, what?  This is not a knee-jerk reaction to a one, uh, a one-time thing.  I don't believe this is something, uh, that other people cannot relate to.  And I am not condemning entire races of people for this.  I am just saying this has been what I have observed for years.  When you go to a movie theater in a predominantly white Long Island neighborhood, like I was raised for many years, okay? 
[01:52:30]  You go in, you sit, you watch the movie, right?  If there's a problem with someone talking, you could turn around and say, excuse me, I'm trying to watch the movie.  Oh, gee, sorry.  Right?  And, and, and, and it usually doesn't happen.  For the most part.  For the most part.  Nowadays, you get the cell phones.  It's a pain in the ass.  I play the other side.  Sometimes you get in those theaters with, uh, all the young.  Kids are another thing.  Right.  Okay. 
[01:53:00]  Kids, they can be white, black, Puerto Rican, I don't care.  Dude, you're right.  You're right.  They're, they're a pain in the ass.  You're right.  They think the theater's theirs.  You're right.  I'm not talking about kids that don't, are not supposed to know what the F they're doing.  I'm talking about adults.  People that are going to a public place to watch a goddamn movie and act like effing animals.  Like beasts.  Anthony?  Yes.  What happened to you?  I go into the theater, me and the girl, to go see Mission Impossible 2. 
[01:53:30]  Right?  Sure.  Sit down in a seat.  All of a sudden, there's a group of, uh, black people running around the theater.  What?  I can't say that they were black people?  No.  I'm tired of it.  A group of black, I will identify everybody.  Okay.  Now I'll talk about white people.  They were all sitting there fearing for their lives.  Okay?  There.  I covered the white people.  Now I'll move on to black people.  A group of black people roaming around the whole, uh, auditorium trying to find seats. 
[01:54:00]  Fine.  But they're being very loud, and I don't want them sitting in front of me.  I could care less at this point if they were from friggin' Jupiter.  They're being loud.  I want to watch the movie.  So, I get up, and I move to the other side of the theater.  I'm like, come on, we're moving.  I move to the other side of the theater to get away from the boisterous people, regardless of their color.  Okay?  Is that nice?  Sit down.  Then they decide, the group of black people, that they don't want to sit there anymore. 
[01:54:30]  So they start roaming around the auditorium, taking seats in the back, then in the middle, and then in the side.  The whole time being very loud.  Disrupting the whole place.  Anthony, can I interrupt you for a second?  Go ahead, Opie.  Stoner Matt, he checks in a lot on our show from Bayonne, New Jersey.  Is it spazes we can review already?  And why is Anthony doing it?  No, look. 
[01:55:00]  Okay.  Look, look.  I am trying to tell you what happened in plain English without going around, beating around the bush.  All right, so this is what happened.  So you were jumping from seat to seat in the movie theater?  I moved once.  I went from the right side of the auditorium.  Quick.  All right, I'm going to get a grappling hook on the vent, on the ceiling.  I'm going to swing over.  Hold on to me.  We've got to get away from the loud people.  How many times did you move away from the black people? 
[01:55:30]  Once.  Once.  Once.  No, I'll be for loud people.  I just pointed out that it was a group of black people that were being loud.  Okay.  They sat down in the row right in front of us, and I said, no, I'm not going to sit here and try to watch a movie and listen to people yelling and screaming.  So we moved to the opposite side of the theater.  Same seat, but on the other side.  Your mission, Anthony, if you're not going to accept it, is to get through this movie without one racial epithet going through your mind. 
[01:56:00]  So.  The pop-up corn will self-destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, Anthony.  Dan from Jersey.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  No, I'm not dinging a goddamn thing.  All right.  Why should I ding something when this is exactly what happened?  And this is something that has bothered you for a while.  For quite some time.  Loud people or black people?  Loud people.  So. 
[01:56:30]  So we move to the opposite side of the theater.  To get away from the.  To get away from the loud black people.  Loud black people.  The loud people.  So.  Then they start.  They keep moving.  They're not satisfied with their seat.  So they're moving.  They're yelling.  They're sitting in seats.  And then they're getting up.  And then they're moving again.  I swear to God.  Five times they did this.  Finally they settle.  Where?  Two rows in front of us.  Again.  Two rows in front of us.  And now at this point. 
[01:57:00]  The theater is getting so full.  There's no seats left.  So we're stuck.  I'm like.  Okay.  Whatever.  At least a one more row away than they were.  Right?  You with me?  So far?  Dan from Jersey.  You mean to tell me black people showed up late for something?  I'm just reading them.  Okay.  Okay.  I'm just reading the instant feedback.  So now.  Don't kill the messenger.  So now.  Okay.  That's where I'm going to be sitting.  Okay?  Okay.  So I'm sitting on the aisle. 
[01:57:30]  So the right.  Let me get you.  Let me set the mood.  Okay.  There's the middle section.  There's two aisles.  The left section and the right section.  I'm in the left section.  I'm on the aisle seat.  In the left section.  Girlfriend sitting to my left.  Okay?  We are ready to watch the movie.  A whole family of Hispanic people.  Come in?  Come in.  Yes?  Why did your girlfriend go with you?  Dinosaur was sold out?  You're a smart ass man.  Yeah, she's 14 years old. 
[01:58:00]  It's Mary Kate Olson.  All right?  It's out.  Okay?  All right.  I'm dating Mary Kate Olson.  Okay.  Back to your start.  All right.  Here we are.  So a whole family of Hispanic people come in and sit in the rest of the row that we are  sitting in.  So you got the Hispanics to your right?  Yes.  Hispanics to the left.  Left.  Okay.  Because I am as far right as we could.  Yeah.  Left. 
[01:58:30]  And in the row in front.  They're taking up that row.  And a couple of the seats in the back.  Well, they're baby machines.  A lot of people.  Well, Opie, there were children with them.  Children of three or five years old.  A couple of children.  Were they courteous enough to leave the chickens home?  No.  There were chickens running around them.  Can I please?  No.  So that's what the seating arrangement was.  Hispanics left in front. 
[01:59:00]  Black lab people also in front.  The woman, Hispanic woman in our row who was taking care of these two children did not shut  up from the time she sat down until the confrontation.  You had a confrontation?  Yes.  Let me just say there was a bit of a confrontation.  But let me just keep going.  The previews start up. 
[01:59:30]  She's yapping, talking to the effing screen.  She's not shutting up.  She's talking to her kids and not in a low movie theater voice.  Opie, she is at full volume.  I'm stunned.  I'm amazed.  Other people, other white people are looking at this woman like, could you shut up?  But I will switch.  But white people are very threatened, very intimidated to say anything.  So, so we don't.  Because, you know something? 
[02:00:00]  You might have bodily harm done to you.  That is the image everyone has, right?  Right.  Not necessarily true.  Okay.  Mission Impossible is playing now.  Now it's the movie.  Now I'm really, I want to get the story.  Did you see the last Mission Impossible?  Um, no.  Okay.  I did.  I really didn't.  You needed a friggin' slide rule and a calculator to keep up with the story.  Right.  So I don't want someone talking.  I want to listen and work with the story.  So you gave up on the reviews, like whatever, they'll settle down after the review. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  She didn't settle down.  All right.  She's talking like a mile a minute.  Tom Cruise comes on.  Here's what she's saying.  And this is, this is how she was saying it.  There's the man.  There's the man.  Tom Cruise, there's the man.  Oh, look at that S.  She's using the S word, every other word out of her effing mouth.  Now, oh, look at that S.  Now, like they'll have a car chase and like Tom Cruise will almost fly off a cliff or something.  Oh, no.  Watch out.  He the man. 
[02:01:00]  Look at that.  Look at that.  How loud really?  That loud?  Dude, yelling.  Yelling.  Star Juanita.  Star Juanita.  Yelling.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Uh-huh.  Oh, you bet that.  That's what I would do.  Uh-huh.  That's what I paid to come in to see this friggin' movie with her yelling.  That's what I paid for.  Right.  No, I wanted to see Mission Impossible 2.  The whole theater is looking in our direction.  And you know they're just saying, shut the eff up. 
[02:01:30]  Shut up.  But no one had the balls to say anything.  No one would say anything.  Except, not me.  My girlfriend.  That's the worst.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You get put in the position.  Ladies, you put us in bad position.  I was this close to saying something.  When you're the one that does the confrontation thing, go ahead.  Yeah, she turns and goes, do you think you could be quiet?  So she said, do you think you could be quiet? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Well, at this point.  That's just not the same.  So right now I'm like, okay, now I go into assess the situation mode.  Yeah.  I'm looking.  I got an entire family of Puerto Ricans to my left.  They're taking up three rows.  I am with my girlfriend.  Yeah, that's part of a family.  And I'm sitting there like, okay, now what?  I'm trying to figure who's got the knives, who's got the gun. 
[02:02:30]  Now I'm really sweating.  Because now you're like, I got to fight.  Now I got to fight.  Yeah, yeah.  Because something happened.  She said, do you think you could be quiet?  Yeah.  Which I don't think is a big thing to say.  Right.  Now, let me bring back to what I was saying earlier.  In a suburban auditorium watching a movie, if someone's being a little boisterous and you turn around and say, do you think you could be quiet?  You might get up.  But then you know something?  That person will probably be whispering the rest of the movie if they have to talk. 
[02:03:00]  You never feel like your life is being threatened.  Well, this bitch goes, maybe I will and maybe I won't.  So now I'm like, okay.  Now, not only am I going to not watch the movie, but now I have to fear that I will be killed here in Mission Impossible.  I'm going to be killed.  Nobody will know because they're in Mission Impossible.  Yeah.  Oh, I.  So then the boyfriend looks at me. 
[02:03:30]  Right.  So now I'm like, oh.  So now my girlfriend turns.  Maybe seeing there's danger in the air.  Maybe detecting my nerves are a little rattled at this point.  There's an entire Hispanic family getting geared up.  She turns and goes, can you just shut the F up?  Yeah.  Wait, let me get to my breath. 
[02:04:00]  Can you just shut the F up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Battle station.  Battle station.  Dive.  Dive.  Dive.  Dive.  You ladies, you put us in bad positions sometimes.  So.  Goddamn.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  The only day has just left the tarmac.  A deadly cargo.  In a belly.  Little tibets.  At the helm. 
[02:04:30]  So, yeah.  Could you shut the F up?  So I'm like, oh.  So now the chick stands up.  The Puerto Rican lady.  Lady.  Stands up.  The boyfriend turns to me and goes, oh, now you put her in battle mode.  Like she's a friggin' transformer.  She, I put her in battle mode.  Even he went like, oh, that's it.  Nothing I can do.  She in battle mode.  Oh, well, how do you turn it off? 
[02:05:00]  It's an off switch on the battle mode.  Is she married to a black guy, Anthony?  No, it was just another Hispanic guy.  Oh, all right.  You're.  But they, well, no, I guess, well, let me say the accent, the inflection on the voice sounded  very black.  Okay.  It wasn't like, it was a mixture between the Hispanic black dialect.  Yeah.  I think you would call that, Opie.  Okay.  Go ahead.  So I'm like, oh, boy.  Okay.  So she steps over and goes, you, you.  In this part, I had to bite my tongue from laughing with the fear in me. 
[02:05:30]  I almost laughed at this.  She turns around and goes, why are you using that kind of language in front of, Opie, she  was about 28 years old.  Okay.  In front of my grandkids.  The blood, the blood dripping off of my tongue from where I had to bite it to keep from laughing  my cracker ass off. 
[02:06:00]  That, meanwhile, she was like, ah, it's this F-A-R, Tom Cruise, he's a man, F-S-F.  That kind of language in front of my grandkids.  The kid's five years old.  Do the math.  Do the math.  Wow.  I'm roaring.  She goes, I ought to slap your face.  I go, oh, boy, here it comes.  So now I'm leaning over.  Because my girlfriend's to my left at this point. 
[02:06:30]  She's between them and me.  Yeah.  So I, yeah.  So now I lean over and I'm looking at her hand because if she has to swing it, I have  to grab the hand, which means the boyfriend has free reign to just punch me in the  face.  So I'm like, okay, now I'm like diplomacy.  Look, I think if you talk to anyone in this audience, they would want to watch this movie  without hearing people yelling and talking.  Do you think we can all do that? 
[02:07:00]  All of us.  Let's sit and watch the movie.  Yeah, well, maybe I'll be quite, so I backed, she backed down, she sat down, high-fiving all  of our relatives, high-fiving, like, yeah, show me, mother.  Can we all just get along?  I was Rodney King.  So I'm sitting, now I'm trying to watch the movie.  Forget it.  I'm going to keep track of Mission Impossible 2, where I have to worry if I'm going to get 
[02:07:30]  killed.  And now I'm hearing every word they're saying.  So I'm just like, oh, this is it.  Yeah.  I go, no, let's go.  I go, let's go.  I'm getting out of here.  I'm going to get the money back that we paid to get in here.  And before we leave, I will say to an officer outside that I believe somebody has a gun 
[02:08:00]  in Theater 1, row 4 to the left, let them handle the fun and hijinks that happen after  that.  The manager said, well, another Mission Impossible is starting up in Theater 2, so you could go  in there.  I'm like, okay, let me give this a whirl.  I walk in, it's almost empty, quiet.  Watch the whole movie from the beginning without a peep.  It was great.  But I was so friggin' pissed, I escaped from Theater 1, Opie. 
[02:08:30]  We made our way through the air ducts and dropped down on some contraption with pulleys  so we didn't touch the floor.  And then we had a motorcycle chase through the lobby.  Unbelievable.  But this just leads me to my whole statement that I was making in the beginning of this.  This isn't the first time this has happened.  This will not be the last time this has happened.  There is something that just happens to people of certain ethnic backgrounds in movies, especially 
[02:09:00]  action movies like Mission Impossible.  They gotta yell at the screen.  They're yelling.  She was, Opie, yelling.  Does she, and I'm trying to get into her head thinking, does she think she's so important  and that everybody wants to hear what she has to say to her friggin' grandkids  and her penis of the month that she's got next to her and whatever else?  And her family, that it's that important what she has to say that I paid nine bucks to get in 
[02:09:30]  and listen to that, to listen to that C-word babble over a friggin' movie?  And it's not the first time.  And I swear to God, there's plenty of yarmulkes in that audience, too.  It's Brooklyn.  It's Brooklyn.  And I don't have a problem.  They're not, you know,  Oy vey, look at Tom Cruise.  Ah!  No!  That is hilarious.  But people, and you know something?  You want to break down the barrier. 
[02:10:00]  You want to say everything's fine.  We can address the issue.  And say, do you think you could be quiet?  Maybe not shut the F up.  But, you know, turn around and say, hey, you know, I'm trying to watch a movie here.  We don't want to hear you talk.  But you know something?  You will be threatened with violence if you do that.  White people.  Hear me, white people.  You will be threatened with violence.  There's a guy on the line.  He goes,  I have a dream today that we can watch Mission Impossible  without people yelling to their grandchildren in penis or the mom. 
[02:10:30]  Now, call me what you want to call me.  I know I'm going to hear it.  But what am I supposed to say?  This is what I see.  This is what I have seen over the years.  Anthony Joker from Jersey checking in.  Anthony, if you want to avoid black and Hispanics, go to a bookstore.  Now I'll ring the bell.  All right.  We've got to take a break, obviously.  Unbelievable.  Ant, because of your little tirade. 
[02:11:00]  Joe from Jersey.  As our boss would say.  Nine bucks.  And it must have been $4.50 for his girlfriend.  Shut up.  After your tirade.  Yes.  Our boss likes to say tirade.  Tirade.  The phones are just absolutely.  Yes, they're going crazy.  So why don't we take a quick break and we'll let everyone in on this little discussion.  Okay, Anthony?  Bravo.  I need a drink.  That's a great little.  Now I need a drink.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I feel stupid. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, so stupid.  I feel stupid and dumb and dumb.  Opie and Anthony.  We've got a smile on our face and our head up our ass.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Paul E. from Lawrence.  Mission Impossible 3.  A quiet theater in Brooklyn.  Anthony, Ranch 1 Restaurants.  It's the makers of the best grilled chicken sandwich on earth.  Oh, I love it.  I love Ranch 1. 
[02:12:00]  That's great.  They're the man.  Yeah, Ranch 1 brought a ton of food by once again today.  Once again, Opie.  What do they do?  Once a week?  Yes.  I can't figure out what day they do it on, though.  I'm always buying lunch on Tuesdays when it comes.  You know, a lot of us concentrate on the grilled chicken sandwiches they have.  But how about the French fries?  Oh, get some of their fries.  They're very good.  They're great.  Yeah.  They've got the grilled chicken sandwiches, the best on earth.  With fajitas, burritos, grilled chicken salads and pastas.  And the newest creation, the grilled chicken parmesan. 
[02:12:30]  Something for everyone at Ranch 1.  Yeah, they have restaurants all over New York and New Jersey and Connecticut.  Including most of the major mall areas.  For a menu and complete lists all Ranch 1 locations.  To order for fast free delivery or to check out where you can get your Wow stickers.  Yes.  Check out Ranch 1 on the web at Ranch1.com.  Ranch 1, the best grilled chicken sandwich on earth.  Try it today.  You'll love it.  Yeah, and you can get the Wow stickers at participating Ranch 1 locations.  So if there's one in your area, you know, stop in and see if they've got the Wow stickers. 
[02:13:00]  Okay?  Ranch 1 restaurants, the makers of the best grilled chicken sandwich on earth.  Let me let you ladies in on something.  Oral never yet old.  Lofi and Anthony.  Their brains are in their pants.  1027.  WNEW.  212-757-1027.  We're doing another Wow sticker stop today.  We're at Strauss Discount Auto, 14th Street and Avenue C.  Psycho Mark's there.  Let's check in with him real fast.  Psycho Mark, what's going on? 
[02:13:30]  Hey, everybody.  How are you?  Hey, Matt.  I'm very, very good.  Good?  Yeah, I'm very happy.  I'm down here in front of Strauss Discount Auto, 14th and Avenue C.  You don't sound very happy.  No, but I am.  That's the funny part.  I'm not happy.  You're not happy.  Are people stopping by for the Wow stickers?  Yeah, there's a bunch of people stopping by, mostly undercover cops and tow truck drivers.  All right, Matt.  Anything else? 
[02:14:00]  No, I've got the invisible sloth with me.  Why are you pissed at me, Matt?  I'm not pissed.  You know what happened was I got hung up on earlier, and it was just rather rude that no  one said, hey, we're going to hang up on your face.  Well, we do that all the time.  We have a radio show to do here, dude.  I know.  My feelings got hurt.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Well, we'll talk to you in a little while.  Bye.  Smoke your joint and calm down.  By the way, people do get hung up on our show because we have a clear phone line.  So if it happens to you, it's nothing personal. 
[02:14:30]  We're just trying to move on and stuff, and it's hard to explain to every single person  why we're hanging up on you.  So it does happen.  John from Jersey looks like, Mission Impossible, finding support from other white people during  a racial fight in a movie theater.  Yeah, they don't watch, man.  They don't watch.  That's pretty funny.  A lot of people coming in with their own versions of what Mission Impossible means.  Very good.  All right.  I guess we've got to go to the phones.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  Well, I've been reading instant feedback during the commercial break, and a lot of people  agreeing with me.  One guy saying he got, the guy that got punched in the face?  Uh-huh.  You reading that one?  No.  One guy got punched in the face just for turning around when someone was talking.  Like, someone's talking.  He turned around, and someone said, what you looking at, and punched him in the face.  See, it's crazy.  See, I don't need any problems when I go to the movies.  I go to the movies, like, once a week, usually, like, on a Tuesday or a Wednesday. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, in the mean streets of Huntington.  No, because, hell, a douche.  Why?  Sometimes you've got to go to Colmack.  That mess.  Oh, ho, ho.  Mm.  And you can confirm that that place is a complete zoo.  That's true.  And I go late at night, because I can't deal with people in the theaters.  Yeah.  Chomping on their popcorn, yelling and screaming, cell phones ringing, big guy with afro right  in front of you.  I can't stand it.  It's one thing when it's just the noise. 
[02:16:00]  It's another when, you know, you've got to wonder if you're even going to get out of  there in one piece.  Chris Rock does a whole bit on that that's hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  He pointed that out a long time ago, that whites and blacks, you know, view movies very  differently.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's his line about, you know, this movie's so good, I've got to do it?  I've got to pop a cap in it.  I've got to pop a cap in here.  Shooting at the screen.  Shooting at the screen, because the movie's so damn good.  Jeremy from Patterson University, William Patterson University. 
[02:16:30]  Hey, Ann, you had a problem with the loud blacks in front of you, the annoying Hispanic woman  to the side of you.  Do you have a problem with the chink director, John Woo?  Yeah, Jesus.  Why does the whole movie have to look like a video?  Pete, what's going on?  Pete.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up, man?  I was at Fordham University, took my girlfriend to go see one of the screams in Manhattan,  sat behind a bunch of Hispanic people in the back of me, screaming at the screen, damn, 
[02:17:00]  girl, what you going up there for?  Don't run outside, run, don't run outside.  Couldn't hear half the movie theater with these people screaming and yelling, and he  couldn't say anything, because you were too scared to say anything.  It was just ridiculous.  You mean, Anthony's right, again, with people in, like, Long Island and stuff, you could  just, like, do me a favor, shut up.  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, sorry.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And is there a need to bring, like, five kids, just trailing five loud kids to, like,  a rated R movie? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, because...  Where they, like, screaming and yelling?  Yeah.  That happens all the time.  I know.  People bring their kids to the movie theater because they don't have a babysitter.  I've gone to, like you just said, R-rated movies, and two three-year-olds are running  up and down the aisles.  I go on when babies are...  People bring babies.  And we're like, what the hell is this lady doing for their little baby?  That's what you want to hear during the movie.  I think it was through that threesome with Stephen Baldwin.  That's what...  I saw that, and I'm like, what is this lady bringing this baby here for?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:18:00]  Opie, Cormac's not that bad.  Cormac has turned into a nightmare.  It used to be.  It's getting a little better now that they've got the cops running around.  Well, thank you.  Why do cops have to hang out at a movie theater?  Figure that out.  Hey, you know, they're there.  You're all right.  You just buried yourself.  It's not that bad since they got the cops.  Cops.  You know something?  They don't even have ushers.  Remember they used to have ushers that used to, like, hit your feet with the flashlight  if you had it on the seat?  Yeah.  They used to have to do that.  Yeah, exactly.  They can't find a friggin' usher loony enough to walk around to tell people in these theaters 
[02:18:30]  what to do and not to do because they'll get their asses handed down.  It's actually ridiculous.  I do not go to the Colmack movie theater anymore.  Well, I'll tell you.  In Brooklyn, we usually go to the UA in Sheepshead Bay, which is fine.  Fine movie theater.  We go to the Pavilion every so often because there's a place next door to get something  to eat.  And in the past few months, I don't know what they did, lower the prices or something?  Because the clientele there has been just the most obnoxious bunch of animals I've ever, 
[02:19:00]  ever had to deal with in my life.  What?  Alex, what are you looking at me for, Rick?  Alex.  Yeah?  We have to get very popular and syndicated all over the country so you can have a private  screening room in your house, Anthony.  Yeah, that's what I need.  Alex, what's up?  Yeah.  Now, I always go to the Pavilion.  I live 20 minutes away.  Two things.  And Park Slope isn't that mean.  I'm a five foot tall Jewish kid.  I haven't gotten mugged once in Park Slope.  Yeah.  Second of all, it happens all the time at the Pavilion. 
[02:19:30]  Why are you going there?  I know everything around there is nice.  It's a nice place to go.  But people don't shut up there.  They turned it into a kid's theater a while ago.  For like half a year, they wouldn't have any R-rated movies.  It was just like all Disney crap.  Yeah.  I don't know because now it's just, I go to the UAE now.  Good.  I live 10 minutes away from the movie theater.  So it's just easier.  But I wish I could go someplace else.  Alex, you'll probably get your ass kicked at some point.  Thanks.  I'll see you guys later.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Tracy, who's black. 
[02:20:00]  Tracy, what's going on?  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Don't feel bad.  It helps us black people do.  Oh, yeah?  We just got to act up like Opie.  You should have said shut up just like Opie does all the time.  Shut up.  Oh, yeah.  Shut up.  You should have been wild out.  Don't feel bad.  I don't even go to the movies at night anymore.  Yeah, see?  I mean, what?  You know something?  I go to 86th Street in that day, Tom.  And that seems like fine to you?  That's fine.  That's like something that...  Annoying.  It doesn't strike you as maybe it shouldn't have gotten to this point? 
[02:20:30]  It shouldn't have.  Not to the movies.  It's just like Opie said, police in the movie theaters.  Never heard of it.  Yeah, that's not good.  And violence is not the only...  I mean, I've had a girl try to attack me in a movie theater, and I just got down for mine.  I don't handle it.  Man, Tracy, how bad has it gotten that even black people are scared?  It's gotten so bad that you don't even know if you're going to be a blood or a crypt at night.  I'm sorry.  That's how bad it got.  You want to be a Latin king in the middle sometimes.  That's funny. 
[02:21:00]  That's bad.  All right.  What are you doing?  It's got to take care.  Thank you, Tracy.  All right, then.  Bye.  Yeah, bonjour.  John Rocker from Midtown checking in, Anthony.  John Rocker.  Are you sure you weren't on the number seven subway instead of the movie theater?  I was so friggin' pissed.  Let me see.  I'm trying to see which ones I could go to here.  There's just some brutal calls coming in.  Angela.  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[02:21:30]  Hey.  Listen, I'm a school teacher.  I got one more thing to tell you, man.  It starts early in the childhood.  I don't show movies in class anymore because they don't shut their mouths.  You think five kids is a lot?  You got to hear 30.  Going at it like you have no idea.  Yelling at the screen in my classroom, guys.  I stopped showing films.  And until I said something one day.  First of all, I'm a white Italian guy.  I ended up at a Brooklyn school.  So already there's tension.  And then I said something one day.  I said, don't you people know that your brain hears you?  You don't have to voice everything. 
[02:22:00]  Your brain hears you.  Guys, I just got my tenure, and they put a letter in my file about it.  Why?  Because it was something that somebody brought up to the principal, who happens to be a young black guy.  So it was all over.  The guy yelled at me.  Then he closed his office door, and I heard him laughing his ass off.  It was unbelievable.  But picture a classroom of 30.  Yeah.  Un-freaking-believable.  I got one more thing to tell you.  Forgive me the time.  Yeah.  I had my good students take about 100 copies of wow signs outside and tape them to all the old ladies' cars in the parking lot. 
[02:22:30]  Cool.  They came in the next day furious that some students played a joke on them.  But it was really me.  All right.  Cool.  Anyway, take care, guys.  See you in case you can go to a movie in Brooklyn and enjoy it.  All right.  Bye, guys.  You know, I'm not saying that, because I know I'm going to get like hell for this.  I'm not saying every black person or every Hispanic person is a problem in the movie theater.  That's ridiculous.  But there is a disproportionate number of blacks and Hispanics that are a problem in the movie theaters. 
[02:23:00]  I've seen it over the years.  It's not this, oh, my God, Anthony, what are you talking about?  There are people that will agree with this.  And I don't understand why you can't just shut up and watch the frigging movie like everyone else.  And the second you turn around and say something, I swear to God, you're the a-hole that is going to get your ass handed to you.  It's just what is the Mission Impossible?  What is the problem? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, man.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Great.  I'm just curious.  I just moved to Comac in like September.  Just got married in November.  I've been to the Comac movie theater a couple of times because I just figured it was a place to go.  Yeah.  What should I be worried about?  You're getting me scared.  I'm listening to you guys.  I'm getting nervous.  One word.  Brentwood.  Really?  Yeah, it's just out of there, huh?  It's too close.  Oh, man.  I didn't even think of that.  I heard you guys talking.  Do you know any specific instances? 
[02:24:00]  Like, how bad is it?  I would have to do some research, but I do believe there were some gunshots within the last couple of years.  Sure.  A couple gunshots.  If someone could confirm that, I'd appreciate it.  I don't want to talk out of my butt today.  I hear you.  I hear you.  And they do have police all over the place patrolling the damn thing.  So I guess it's gotten better, but...  I went there like on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  I didn't see any cops.  I saw some rinky-dink security.  But I did notice the place was a ghost town.  And that kind of made me think. 
[02:24:30]  I was like, hey, you know.  There you go.  I just figured we'd pick a good night.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Have a great day.  Thank you.  Anthony, a psychologist is going to try to explain why minorities act up in the movie theater.  Thank you.  Finally, a professional.  Jack?  Because I want an answer to this.  Yes, Jack.  Hello.  Hey.  What it comes down to is most non-black or Spanish, we'll put it that way, people, as they grow up, they go on vacation.  They go on family trips.  The movies, to the ethnic people, is a vacation or a family trip. 
[02:25:00]  You're not a psychologist?  As well as you must understand.  You must understand.  It's like Disneyland.  Why people can afford interactive TV.  This is interactive movies.  Oh, my God.  So just do what we all do.  Bring your gun and have a good time.  Thank you.  Have a good morning, guys.  A professional opinion from a psychologist, don't they?  Anthony, I can't confirm it, but I don't think that was a psychologist.  I don't either. 
[02:25:30]  I'm not sure, but let's go to Christine.  Christine, you're next on NAW.  Hey, guys.  I went, believe it or not, to the Pokemon movie with my son.  And these people in front of us, I don't know what language they were speaking, but I wanted to tell them to shut up, but I was with my son.  I didn't want to cause a problem.  He says out loud, why do people have to talk during the movie?  These two women turn around.  I mean, they look like female wrestlers.  And I'm sitting there going, oh, man. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, and then all of a sudden, you're the idiot.  Yeah.  You know, I'm six years old.  I have a solution.  I've thought this out.  Uh-oh.  A little bit.  You want to hear my solution?  Yeah, go ahead.  It might cost some money, but...  Okay.  We wire every seat with an electric charge.  Okay?  Everyone has buttons on the back of the seat that's in front of you.  You can't just zap someone for the hell of it.  There has to be maybe a certain percentage of the audience has to hit that person's seat to zap them. 
[02:26:30]  You get me here?  That would be perfect.  So that way you can't just, you know, go around zapping everybody.  But if you see seat number 25 has been a problem and everyone knows it, you're going to zap seat 25.  Oh, yeah.  And with a lethal dose of electricity, mind you.  Not just a little.  No.  There has to be something because I've seen nobody. 
[02:27:00]  No one is enforcing be quiet, turn off the goddamn cell phones, and watch the frigging movie.  They put the little...  They put the cell phones and everything.  Yeah, they put the thing in the beginning.  Now, make sure I turn off all cell phones, and the dancing popcorn comes out, and they'll just shut the frig up.  But you know something?  Five seconds in the movie.  I'm not getting that.  Oh, I know who that is.  Now with Tom Cruise on the screen.  And everyone's got to know, I'm not getting that because that's my ex-husband. 
[02:27:30]  They think everyone wants to hear their business.  All right, Christine.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Someone, there should be...  You know something?  I would go to a movie theater.  If you're movie theater owners or are out there listening, I would go to a theater.  Every time, I would spend twice the amount of money on a ticket.  If when you walked in there, there were bouncers like at a strip club in every theater.  And the second someone voices up, they get thrown out like a drunk trying to touch some cooch.  I swear to God, I would be in there in a second just to watch that. 
[02:28:00]  But I swear to God, wouldn't that be great?  You walk in, there's a big bounce, all of a sudden, yeah, Tom Cruise, you and I, whoa, what's he doing?  And bam, you're hauled out.  That's not a bad idea.  I would pay twice the amount of money for a ticket.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  My Mission Impossible 2 experiences was just as miserable.  I'm sitting there, and first these seven guys come in 20 minutes late. 
[02:28:30]  Then they don't shut up.  They move musical chairs throughout the whole movie.  Oh, you must have been in the same place I was.  Well, actually, I was in Willowbrook, New Jersey.  The theater was horrible.  I told, fine, I couldn't take it.  I could tell all my friends would get noticed.  I said, hush.  What did the guy say?  He says, lick my something, right?  There you go.  Lick my something.  That's the answer you get.  Then I'm like, well, you're disrupting the movie, moron.  And then he says, kiss my, you know what?  So my friend next to me goes, Chris, don't make a scene.  Just let it go.  And I don't put up with this.  You know what's even more annoying than this?  The laser pointers. 
[02:29:00]  Why do they have to bring them to the movie theater?  Oh, let me tell you something.  I got so distracted from the Hispanic family to my left  that I forgot to tell you about the black people in front  that were giving me the problem at the beginning.  Little maglite flashlight flashing it in people's eyes.  During the movie.  During the friggin' movie.  Do you need that?  I know you're fascinated by a light.  Oh, God.  Coming like a mission to have an enjoyable experience at the theater. 
[02:29:30]  It's impossible.  Thank God for Joey Paisano and the DVD player, Opie.  Yes.  Thank God.  Because I'm going to hook that thing up.  I'm going to build a vault that I'm going to live in.  And just a little slot in the front for someone to slip in DVDs.  Hey, Cowbell Bill on the line.  Huh?  Bill.  Cowbell Bill.  What's up, boys?  How's your cranky ass?  What's up, Bill?  Not much, man. 
[02:30:00]  Listen, I just wanted to say I had a great time at the show.  Yeah, the road show Thursday.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  All right.  And?  Yeah.  Time to come home.  Yeah, you've got to get back to Long Island.  I forgot what it was like, the safety and sanctity of North Point.  I know.  It's unbelievable.  But have you noticed, like, it's just a general attitude all over?  Yeah, it is.  It's gotten out of hand.  Whether it be behind the counter at McDonald's.  Yep.  Or, you know, I had a friend of mine.  She brought her son to the dentist the other day.  Went out to use the bathroom in the hallway. 
[02:30:30]  Anyway, and, you know, I'm not pointing the finger at anybody, but there's a black woman  out there.  Her son is in the women's room with the door open, peeing all over everything.  Jesus Christ.  So she turns around.  She comes back in.  Sits down at the dentist.  Like, I'm not going there.  You know?  And the woman comes in.  It's like, what's your problem?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, big confrontation there.  But, yeah, just, it's all over the place.  The lawnmower guy on the fairway yesterday came toward me, five, ten miles an hour. 
[02:31:00]  I'm standing there waiting to hit my ball.  I had to move out of the way.  Runs over my ball.  Oh, my God.  Right?  And just keeps on going into the sunset.  I'm like, no.  You should have whipped the ball out, Bill, and the driver.  And just smacked him.  And around his head.  We've done that before on the course.  All right, you run over my ball.  Here comes one right to the back of your head.  That's it, man.  But just in general, man, it's an attitude that, you know, young kids, white, black, whatever.  They all got it.  I don't know where it's coming from. 
[02:31:30]  I don't know.  Gated communities for everyone.  That's it.  All right, Bill.  I just wanted to voice my opinion, guys.  Cool, man.  All right.  Later.  Take it easy.  There goes cranky-ass cowboy.  Hey, Bill.  Cowboy, Bill.  Yeah, you know.  Cowbell, Bill.  I don't know what it is.  I think.  I'm tired of it.  But there's nothing you can do about it.  Right.  You just got to deal with it.  But then you get more and more pissed off.  And you can't even go to the movies anymore.  Memorial Day weekend. 
[02:32:00]  That's just insane to try to get into a movie.  You know, but I swear.  It happens all the time.  Everyone obviously did it, but.  It happens everywhere.  It's people that just don't give a F.  They think their life is so friggin' important that they put themselves above everyone else.  All I want is to go and watch a goddamn movie.  That's it.  In silence.  Russ.  In relative silence.  Russ.  Yeah.  Russ, man, what's up?  I think you're the last call on this subject.  What do you got?  All right, man.  Listen, Anthony, I got a solution for you.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:32:30]  You go to the ticket.  When you go to the ticket booth, just tell them you're hearing impaired.  Okay?  And they'll give you a set of infrared headphones.  You got to put down, like, a 20-up deposit or something on them.  Yeah, sure.  And they'll give it right back to you at the end.  You don't got to take crap from nobody.  Wow, that's cool.  That's definitely cool.  All right, Russ.  All right.  Syndication, who cares?  I got in through a phone call, so.  All right, cool.  Something just tells me.  You should be able to go to a movie. 
[02:33:00]  I'm not reading that.  Anthony, you want to buy Kevlar vest cheap for your next movie outing?  Oh, well, we forgot to get your review.  Was it a good movie?  Oh, no.  I didn't like it.  I'm not going to say anything about it or anything.  It's just the first one, which was, like, eh, was better than this one.  Really?  The only cool thing with, like, the cool masks that they wear, the Mission Impossible masks.  Mm-hmm.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  And they peel it off.  Ding, ding, ding. 
[02:33:30]  Oh.  Yeah, those are cool.  I don't know.  The story was kind of, eh.  I didn't care.  Maybe I was just, maybe there was more action in the theater before I saw the movie, so it kind of made it pale by comparison.  I don't know.  All right, eh.  Good job.  You know, there's no way, my final statement.  Yeah.  There's no way any group of people of any ethnic background is going to get respect and be treated like friggin' human beings if you don't act like them. 
[02:34:00]  That's it.  That's it.  You can't force a group to like another group or respect another group.  They have to earn it.  And from what I'm seeing, nothing's being earned.  Thank you.  As far as the movies go.  And?  Yes, I'll be.  You didn't go to Wendy's after the movie, did you?  I know it.  Look at you people.  All right, let's regroup.  Let's regroup.  We're done with the wacky movie theater. 
[02:34:30]  You want to give out Red Hot Chili Pepper tickets or wrestling tickets?  I like that wrestling.  You want the wrestling this hour?  All right, we'll do the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the 6 o'clock hour.  But right now, if you're the 10th caller at 212-757-1027, you get a pair of tickets to see the WWF June 24th at the Garden.  Powered by O.P. and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027-WNEW New New York. 
[02:35:00]  2-1-2-757-1027 as Cole Chamber kicks in here real fast.  Bah!  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Gorilla Boy.  Now we don't.  How's that?  Used to be known as Jeff Norris.  He's now known as Gorilla Boy.  Gorilla Boy.  Thanks to Otto and George.  Gorilla Boy bringing in his pictures from the road show. 
[02:35:30]  These are very nice, but it was quite a skeptical getting these developed at CBS.  Oh, wow.  I'm wondering how many people are having trouble getting their pictures back.  I did.  How many people are getting arrested?  I had a rough time.  And this is kind of a machine that's right behind the counter by the pharmacist.  Oh, it displays?  Like people can just walk by.  It's a picture facing out, so there was a lady in front of me.  So she sees a picture like this one of Trish in her bikini.  And she sees a picture of Otto so they don't get too bad.  But then when they have pictures of, like, the fun bags and the whale eye shot and everything, 
[02:36:00]  she goes, oh, my God, this place is.  So the guy goes, why don't you tell me the honor?  I can't develop them.  I'm like, calm down.  I go, listen.  I said, they're from Opie Anthony's road show.  So there was this technician there from Kodak working on a machine or something.  He goes, get out of here.  He gives me a stack of coupons.  He goes, I'll give you free enlargements if you let me take the negatives.  It was wild, man.  It was a great weekend.  There were hundreds of cameras there. 
[02:36:30]  Hundreds.  There's got to be...  It was nuts.  Thousands.  I mean, 50,000.  There's got to be thousands of pictures.  Way more than thousands.  Huge.  Just ridiculous.  I was, like, sliding to home base between the legs taking pictures and stuff.  We're trying to get a hold of Steve from foundrymusic.com because he's only gone through half the videotape so far for the road show.  I think he's got 30 clips up right now.  I think he has all the shots that I have because you can see his camera and some of the pictures right behind us.  So we were kind of a tag team that day.  All right.  Let's go to Getz. 
[02:37:00]  Getz, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Perfect opportunity for a live shot.  What are you talking about?  For the psychopaths.  What are you talking about?  You've got a guy hanging off of a building on First Avenue and Delancey Street.  Every news crew is over it.  All right.  Get out of here.  The guy's hanging from the building?  The guy, if you put on any news station, the guy's wearing red pants, hanging off the side of the building.  The cops are there trying to talk him down.  He's pissed because he missed the road show.  I'm a truck driver.  I just drove by. 
[02:37:30]  I mean, can anyone else confirm this?  Is it on TV?  I just heard it on 1010.  That's why, like, I was looking over there.  I was sitting in traffic.  Turned on 1010 for a second.  What is the guy just hanging from his hands or what?  The guy is literally like he was climbing a rock wall.  He's hanging off the side of the building.  Whoa.  Sick, man.  Sick.  And what is it, First Avenue and?  It's like Delancey Street and First Avenue, one block east.  Yeah, okay.  Can't miss it.  Cool.  Thank you, Getz.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Whatever you need, Leo, Getz.  Right on, Bob. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, that's nuts.  All right, we talked about the Knicks.  Big, huge win yesterday without Ewing.  In the lineup.  Makes me a very happy boy today.  Yes.  Hope he always looks like the hero.  What are you handing out?  I don't know.  What is this?  Mike Tyson.  Oh, wow.  Oh, the Mike Tyson thing.  He's always in the news, this guy.  This was in People Magazine.  Actually, there's a couple interesting things in the latest issue of People Magazine. 
[02:38:30]  Sandy's confirming jumper.  Hold on.  Sandy.  Hey.  Hey.  I'm right here on Delancey.  There's literally a guy in red sweatpants hanging off the side of a building.  Are you serious?  I'm telling you that every square block in like a five-block radius is blocked off.  There are hundreds of people on the street, and this guy is hanging by his arms from the  corner of a building with three cops standing over him.  How can he hold on for that long?  Listen, I don't know. 
[02:39:00]  I'm not up there, but I can see him hanging.  Can you see him right now?  I just rounded the corner.  I can't, but up until you just asked that question, I can see him.  Psycho Mark's in the area.  He should go down there with the megaphone and just start screaming, jump, jump, jump.  It's absolutely unbelievable, and there are easily 200 cops down here.  Wow.  Yeah, it's pretty insane, so I just wanted to give you the latest update.  All right.  Thank you, Sandy.  No problem.  All right.  Bye.  Got to get some live wows on TV today.  Oh, yeah.  Some guy getting splattered. 
[02:39:30]  They should have a wow trampoline from the jump into.  So, Ant, there's a couple interesting things in People Magazine this week.  Yeah.  Did you read about Dana Carvey?  Anyone read about Dana Carvey?  I wonder, like a lot of people, where he's been lately.  He's had some heart problems.  He's only like, what, 42 years old or something.  Yeah.  A few years back, he was having all sorts of chest pains and stuff.  So he goes in for that angioplasty that Regis had, you know?  Sure.  He had it done like three or four times.  Three or four times, and he still had the chest pains. 
[02:40:00]  It was bad.  So they finally decide he needs some bypass surgery.  He needs, I think, two arteries cleared out.  What, did they have, like, pizza cheese in his bottle when he was a baby?  I don't know.  42 when you got the heart problems.  Dude, this gets sick.  So they got to do the, you know, the bypass on two of the arteries.  I'm looking at the TV, sorry.  All right.  So he doesn't go to, like, a place where his doctor said to go.  He decided to have the operation closer to home, and he goes into this hospital and gets it done. 
[02:40:30]  So after the operation, he's starting to feel good.  But quickly, a couple weeks, and he's right back having the chest pains and stuff.  And he's like, what the hell's going on?  I had the angioplasty.  That didn't work.  I had the bypass surgery.  I should be fine now.  I'm 42, right?  Goes to his doctor.  Turns out they did the bypass on the wrong artery.  Oh, no way.  What, they did it on the good one?  They did it on the good artery.  Oh, man.  So they took a good artery. 
[02:41:00]  They effed up one of his good arteries.  Oh, and still the bad one.  I mean, he's still got the bypass.  So now, I mean, it's clear, but it's not like having your good, strong artery in your heart.  Because they've got to use the artery in your leg, which isn't as strong.  And they said, besides that, they said he could have died.  Because, you know, everyone was assuming he was clear and everything.  He's going back to running and stuff.  Still having the chest pains.  He's going to drop dead of a heart attack.  Whoa.  How sick is that?  That is wild.  It stinks.  He's great, too. 
[02:41:30]  So, but, I mean, there's a whole article in People Magazine about the surgery and how he's suing everybody.  Chopping broccoli.  I'll sue.  And how he's finally back.  But that was the reason why he hasn't been around lately.  Chopping broccoli.  Isn't that nuts?  Doing the bypass surgery on the wrong artery?  A healthy artery?  Yeah, we've got people that are in the office across from that jumper.  Is that true?  Let's go to Stu.  I don't know.  Stu, what's up?  Hi, I'm walking right across the way from that place.  The guy's hanging and screaming. 
[02:42:00]  I can't really hear what he's making out.  But he's definitely there.  He's saying, okay, terrific.  He's saying, okay, terrific.  He's saying, okay, terrific.  He's good.  There's no way he's not going to fall, though.  He's got him.  I'm over here now.  Well, this is radio.  Explain this to us.  He's just hanging by his fingers?  He's hanging.  The cop looks like he's trying to fall from the top.  Trying to what?  You know, try to grab onto his arm so he doesn't fall.  But if he falls, that cop's going down with him.  Oh.  You know, if you want to jump, you know, take out your own life.  Don't take out a cop's life or something else's life. 
[02:42:30]  They should just let him go.  How can he hang on for this long?  I know I couldn't, Mike.  He's hanging from a corner ledge?  Yeah, but sometimes up on the corner, you've got the window washing, scaffolding,  but he might be on a wire or something.  Who knows?  All right.  Let him jump.  Hey, for Red Hot Chili Peppers, try to guess when the guy jumps.  And you could see him plain and clear?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Hold on a while.  How many stories up is he?  I guess at the six or eight-story building. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  I'll leave a mark.  Something like that.  And he's screaming?  Not really.  He's yelling something, but I don't know if he's...  He can't really make out what he's saying.  Can you open a window?  These windows don't open.  Are you kidding?  They'd rather let us die of the fumes from the building.  I want somebody in a building, like, right near him that has an open window so we can  hear him yelling.  Yeah.  I want to hear him scream on the way down.  That's our goal right now.  You should just send the cycle mark down there.  Stu, hold on.  I'm going to keep you on the line, all right? 
[02:43:30]  Sure.  Hold on.  A cop wants to confirm this.  Bobby!  Yo, what's up?  What's going on?  What's happening?  Listen, he is hanging off the building, but there's airbags everywhere.  So if we fall, it's no big deal.  Oh, they got airbags?  Everybody's up there.  Everybody and their grandmother.  Tell anybody that's going there, just don't.  Because too many people are over there.  What cycle mark in the building next door could be kind of fun.  So what have you found out?  Why is he hanging? 
[02:44:00]  And what is he yelling?  They tell us a lot, but they don't tell us that much.  He's just hanging off the roof.  The call comes over the radio and everybody and their grandmother went.  I heard that he's pissed because he couldn't see Mission Impossible 2 in a quiet movie theater.  I think he's pissed because he got disturbed over Memorial Day weekend with a beeper in the movie theater.  Yeah.  That has to be it.  Listen, you know, look, there's a lot of airbags.  If he goes, he goes.  All right, Bobby.  Listen, greetings.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Now, Stu didn't say anything about that.  What? 
[02:44:30]  Hey, Stu.  Yeah.  There's airbags on the ground?  Yeah, now I see they're blowing them up pretty seriously.  Ah.  Ah, if the guy had any balls, he jumped before they filled him.  That's him.  Hey, Stu.  Stu.  Yellow.  Stu.  God.  This guy sounds like he's in his car, not in an office building.  What is your office building moving into the Holland Tunnel?  Stu.  Stu Pit.  See if you can get him back. 
[02:45:00]  That's a moving car phone.  I think he's lying.  Stu Pit.  Yeah, it's Mark Dannen from Channel 2.  Very good.  No way.  Nothing on the TV, though, huh?  I don't know.  What do you want to show them today?  It's a tough area to get down to.  I don't know.  Well.  Oh, my God.  Look how old she's getting.  Who is she?  Michelle Marsh.  Michelle Marsh.  Stu.  He's in a car.  God, she looks like they powdered her face up like one of those Chinese geisha girl things. 
[02:45:30]  Hell.  Yeah.  No one's getting really old.  Bill Dutel.  Put him out of his misery.  What are you guys doing?  I thought he was dead.  The guy is so old.  He doesn't have any voice left.  Bill Dutel.  We've been watching him ever since we were, what, four?  Five?  Long time he's been on TV.  His voice is so weak.  I'm a huge liver sput.  Bill Dutel.  I'm just a giant liver sput. 
[02:46:00]  All right.  Well, now everyone's calling about the jumper.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Is it the same guy that jumped at the Yankee game over the weekend?  Did you see that?  That guy's pretty funny.  The guy definitely jumped on purpose, knowing that he could, like, hit that net.  Yeah.  And then the ump was just like, F him.  Play.  Right.  They kept playing.  Just keep playing.  Screw this guy.  He laid there for a while. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  And then he gets up all drunk.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Holy New York.  I got to say, Ed and I were in Boston this weekend.  Oh, that guy made New York look so bad.  Everywhere I went on, they were on.  You see those stupid idiots at the stadium.  You see a guy playing with a Yankees in his socks.  Right.  He's dead drunk.  He was caught.  He was pulling to the net.  He's jumping into the net.  He's wicked bizarre. 
[02:47:00]  Ah, they hate the Yankees up there.  Oh, my God, do they hate them.  They were chanting it at one point at the Foxboro Stadium for the concert.  Yeah.  Yankees suck.  Like, yeah, sure.  Okay, sure.  That's like, you know, that's like chanting air sucks.  You know?  I mean, you can say whatever you want, but you know it rolls.  You know it kicks your sorry Red Sox ass.  That's all.  Yeah, Yankees suck.  Yeah, sure. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Water food sucks.  Eat me.  Anthony, we can't confirm this, but someone's saying it's Steve Mason hanging from that building.  Oh, man.  Of course, can't confirm that.  And now that people have found out it is Steve, they're starting to just leave the area.  He's screaming, but no one seems to be listening.  He got fired from doing mornings here in case we had some new listeners. 
[02:48:00]  And he was bragging about how he's got this brand new syndicated show that's going to be heard all over the country.  Sue pushed him.  Well, that syndicated show has already been canceled.  Ouch.  That's got to hurt.  Bill Butel has slowly turned into the new Roger Grimsby.  He is.  Remember when we were kids?  Like, Roger Grimsby was the old guy?  Yeah.  And he finally died.  And Bill Butel is like the young, hip anchor man.  Now he's like Roger Grimsby.  Roger Grimsby.  Roger Grimsby.  Look at my liver spot. 
[02:48:30]  It's just one.  It comes to my whole body.  And this just in?  The jumper?  Yeah.  It's being reported that it's Psycho Mark trying to get on another radio show.  Hey, Rich, what's up?  Hello.  How are you, Rich?  Hey, how's it going?  That's the same dude.  I haven't seen the guy on Delancey Street, but I work on 12th Street and 5th Avenue. 
[02:49:00]  And it's the same dude that tried to jump last week, but they got him down.  They had the mats out and everything.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's some loony.  I say let him jump.  Somebody should stick a knife in the balloons and let him jump.  Yeah, if you do it once and they save you, if you want to do it again, they ought to just let you.  Yeah, it's an occasion when the guy jumps.  All right, very good.  Later.  I mean, after a suicide attempt like that, you're obviously probably given the best psychological care that you can get right after it.  On our money. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, on our money, thank you.  And if it doesn't work, I mean, what does he have to look forward to?  Just let him do it.  Who cares?  Where's Mel Gibson when you need him?  Thin out the herd, yeah.  You want to jump?  You want to jump?  That is such a sick scene.  All right, let's do it.  Come on, let's go.  I want to go.  I want to go.  You want to go?  Someone's saying it's Scott Meuny, tired of two for Tuesday already, and he's jumping from the top of the Q104 building.  Just in it, it's a black girl, but he's too lazy to actually jump. 
[02:50:00]  That's good.  Can't confirm any of these reports.  Joe, you're next on NEW.  Yeah, it's Mike Adams.  All right, thank you.  Thanks a lot.  Oh, I'm in a band now.  We're covering Baby Raper.  It's our new official cover.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Do it, huh?  Wow.  Right.  That's pretty cool.  Fuel would be flattered.  Yeah, it rocks.  That's fraud.com. 
[02:50:30]  All right, thank you, Joe.  Thanks.  Covering Baby Raper.  It's a cover, too.  It's a cover.  That's great.  I'm jumping.  Come on.  What are you going to do?  Bell on the car phone.  Talk me down.  Mike, what's going on?  I think the jumper's actually a faithful listener trying to get the show syndicated.  Very good.  Thank you. 
[02:51:00]  It's not Rick Lazio getting more attention for his head to run, is it?  The whole falling down thing didn't quite work, so he's going to the next level.  He figures it's a little higher.  They're saying now that it's a construction worker who slipped and he was trying to pee on Spaz's head.  Rob from Brooklyn, Anthony.  Yeah?  Even though I'm in Brooklyn, I can see the jumper.  It's Anthony's lawyer. 
[02:51:30]  That's not funny.  It's funny because I don't know him.  All right.  I'm over here now.  Mike Tyson.  So the other article in People Magazine started this about a half hour ago.  Yeah.  During a recent party at his house in Las Vegas, not only did boxer Mike Tyson tell guests that his wife of three years, Monica Turner, a pediatrician, and the mother of two of his children, is divorcing him, 
[02:52:00]  he also showed off cameras in his bedroom that he said he uses to protect himself against any accusations of rape.  Hmm.  Is that what he does?  He's got the cameras in the bedroom now.  Yeah.  So no one could accuse him of rape.  It doesn't even know that.  I will be taping this, videotaping this, just in case.  Does he ask for permission?  Do I ask for permission? 
[02:52:30]  Let me read that in the article.  No, he doesn't.  If I could read, I would read it myself.  Right.  Let's see.  House Las Vegas.  Mike Tyson.  Tyson.  Oh, that's me.  So what is it?  He videotaped?  No, he's now, he now has videotapes in his bedroom, so he's not accused of rape.  So he rapes him in a living room.  Right.  Wow.  He'll take the cameras on the road? 
[02:53:00]  I wonder if Tyson, who's one-year managed actor as Robin Givens, ended in 1989, will take the cameras on the road.  Oh.  Well, he probably should.  Because he does most of his raping on the road, Anthony.  Yeah.  That he does.  Yeah, come into the hotel room.  I've set up, uh, don't know, don't look at that.  That's just a piggy bank.  With a little hole on his snout.  And that, I swear, is a smoke detector. 
[02:53:30]  Even though you hear something moving inside it, and there's a bright floodlight coming down on the bed.  I'm going to make sure I can see this.  Now, let me look.  There you go.  That's a good shot.  Stay there.  Don't move.  Don't move.  No, this is just me making love, baby.  Come on.  Now you're being silly.  It's not like there's a camera anywhere.  I can't get in trouble for having a camera in here, can I?  And that's why I punch you.  In the universe. 
[02:54:00]  I'm going to go in for the deep shot.  Wow, he must have some good videos then, huh?  Imagine what that looks like.  He's out of his mind.  That looks like the Loch Ness Monster.  Let me tell you, going into a cave.  I said, don't look at me, bitch.  I slap you.  All right, you stay there.  Don't wipe the blood away.  I have to change the tape.  I ran out. 
[02:54:30]  Take that with you and lay right here.  Because I got to change to Super 8.  Okay?  Look what I did to you again.  See, we can rewind and both look at what I did to you again and again.  Allegedly.  All right.  You whore.  I will kind of this one.  Look what I did to you again, you whore. 
[02:55:00]  I'll punch you.  Give me another label.  Hang the vulva.  Look at this one.  Me boning whores, volume 1 to 80.  This is last week's collection.  A little wacky.  And Mike, man, that's great.  A lot of people taking in about the jumper still, Anthony.  Old cranky ass from Midtown.  Forget the airbags.  They should use foam.  It worked at the O&A Summer Bash.  Well, not really. 
[02:55:30]  Dave from Manhattan.  Jumpers' last words.  Shut up, Bernard.  Joe from Jersey.  Suicide, Gonzo style.  Let's go to Billy.  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Hello?  Billy Ballou.  Hello?  Yeah, I want to know why I have 1010 Winds on,  and they tell me there's some sort of problem down on Delancey Street.  Police investigation.  We don't have details yet.  But I turn you two guys on.  You tell me there's a jumper up there.  We're well connected. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, I don't get it.  All news, all day.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All the news you need to know, and boobs.  Hey, syndication when there's more unsplotted himself, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Billy.  Look, we're ahead of 1010 Winds today, Anthony.  Yeah.  We have a news exclusive.  Breaking news here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sandy.  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  Good.  You guys making fun of somebody getting raped? 
[02:56:30]  Um, when were we doing that?  I heard you doing that.  Um, what are you talking about, baby?  What am I talking about, baby?  I'm talking about you, baby.  This is Iron Mike Pryson.  You remember me?  I was pulled away for raping a woman allegedly.  Oh, no, that was rape, wasn't it?  I went away for that.  Now I videotape my horse.  It's not rape.  It's just in your bedroom, right? 
[02:57:00]  It's not rape we're talking about because I have not been convicted.  Why, you got a problem with Iron Mike Tyson?  I don't got a problem with Mike Tyson, although Mike Tyson's a you-know-what.  Why don't you come over here?  Only if I could go in your bedroom with your videotape, okay?  I will whine and dine you.  And then make you, why are your friggin' jaw shut?  You know, for...  Shut up!  Oh, my God.  Goodbye. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, goodbye.  She'll be coming back for more.  I gotta get this special wide lens for your fat ass.  You wish.  Don't I?  Yeah, I do wish.  You're gonna need a big ass when you get about 18 inches of Louisiana black snake, you whore.  Not with your small penis.  Shut up!  I'll crack you.  You need one right in the...  I can't say that word.  That's right, you can.  Right in the labia majora. 
[02:58:00]  Lady L-U-C.  No, no, no, no.  Goodbye.  Come on.  Anthony, we have another update on the jumper.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  We're your news station.  Lisa, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Great.  I live in the area.  I just drove by.  Yeah.  The guy threw himself off of the roof.  Yeah.  Changed his mind.  It's dangling from the edge of the roof above a fire escape. 
[02:58:30]  And nobody...  And they have a pillow set up.  A pillow.  A pillow.  Yeah, it's a big, huge, cushion-type air-filled thing.  No, that's an airbag, not a pillow.  What is it, a pillow for Godzilla?  No, a pillow for an idiot.  They should step on his fingers and let him fall off the roof.  That would be cool.  An hour's worth of traffic crossing the bridge.  Four ambulances standing by and two fire trucks.  He needs to jump!  He's yelling, jump. 
[02:59:00]  Can you see him right now?  No, I drove away already.  I can't see him.  But there are more ambulances going towards that direction.  That's all the ruckus.  Can we get a megaphone down there and just start screaming, jump?  Yeah.  Somebody, please help us.  We should do that.  There's a whole bunch of people there.  Step on his face.  My kids are starting to yell, jump now.  All right.  Bye, guys.  No problem.  Bye.  Hey, I would like to do a movie with you.  Come here.  I want to film all of my movies in the gonzo style.  Can I get stars over here? 
[02:59:30]  Someone get a speaker out the window.  We want to talk to the jumper live.  Yeah.  Can we do that?  We want to talk to the jumper live.  We'll get him to jump.  This just isn't an airbag.  It's a Rockaway bedding chair.  See, we want this guy to jump.  We don't want to save him.  You know how usually people talk him down?  Yeah.  We just want to make him jump.  Someone get a speaker out of thin the hurdle.  Out their window and get us on a phone right now. 
[03:00:00]  What?  It'll happen.  It will happen.  You watch.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Someone's got to be there listening.  Now he's going to reach back with one hand, pull his cell phone out of his back pocket and fall.  They just pulled the jumper in, it looks like.  Did they?  We'll get the exclusive here.  Here, 1010, we'll have this in 20 minutes.  Rich, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  I'm on the scene over here.  They just pulled him over. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, they did?  Yeah, he's on the roof.  Ah, damn it.  Why didn't you guys let him go?  I had nothing to do with it.  I was just driving by.  Yeah?  I heard it on the radio.  I didn't hear it on my radio.  I heard it on your radio.  Oh, cool.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Thanks for that.  Jumper is safe.  Ah, damn it.  You haven't had a good jumper in a while.  Yeah.  We had one outside the Hard Rock, not the Hard Rock, the Harley Davidson.  Oh, that guy splattered. 
[03:01:00]  He went like 25 stories.  Is that the one on a picture of the guy on a sidewalk?  He did.  I think so.  That was actually a different one.  He did a header, though.  Exploded.  Yeah.  For down.  Why are you jumping?  It's not a tumor.  All right, we got to take a break, Ant.  Enough on the jumper.  I guess he's safe.  Look how sad we sound. 
[03:01:30]  Dan from Hell.  I love to see other fans with random sayings on their cars.  I've seen OK Terrific.  Hey, I'm over here now, and how's my blue knot?  Very funny stuff when you're driving.  Is that true?  People starting to do that on their cars, too?  I guess so.  All right, Ant.  I promised the Red Hot Chili Pepper tickets.  Let's give those away.  All right.  We'll regroup.  I think we're close to what did we learn today on the O&A show.  Very close.  Winner receives a pair of tickets to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Foo Fighters July 14th at the PNC Arts Center. 
[03:02:00]  The show is sold out, but we do have some tickets laying around the joint.  We'll take the 10th caller right now.  212-757-1027.  A gigantic blue box is coming down.  Hand me the RPG-7.  O&A and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  Anthony Rockaway Bedding.  Oh, I love my Rockaway Bedding bed. 
[03:02:30]  You know, if they put the bed that I got underneath the jumper and he jumped, he would fall asleep right there on the Rockaway Bedding bed, not even knowing he had plummeted.

[03:04:00]  I believe we've covered everything today, Anthony.  Yes.  An action-packed show.  Oh, yeah.  Want to say hi to everyone going to the Devils game tonight?  Devils playing for the Stanley Cup again.  Yeah.  And the Islanders on the golf course once again this year.  Please.  Drive for five.  Drive for five, man. 
[03:04:30]  Well, obviously going to root on the Devils.  I'm not going to lie, I'm not a big fan of the Devils, but...  Well, yeah.  There should be a zoo down there tonight.  Sure.  Drive for five.  Um, you know what we should do, though?  What can we give away?  Fosse rules.  Fosse rules.  Fosse rules, man.  Fosse.  Come on.  Nystrom sucks.  That was great.  Nystrom.  That was great.  Clark Gillies. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah.  Bill Smith.  Chico Rash.  Nystrom didn't need no helmet.  That's right.  That's right.  He took pucks to the head.  He didn't care.  Oh, Anthony.  What's the matter?  We should, uh...  I was thinking...  We need to start getting, uh...  You know...  Live boobs on TV now.  The wow signs are cool.  We'll keep that going.  But we need a girl brave enough to flash.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  I'm thinking...  I'm thinking the Devils game tonight.  I'm thinking it.  Yeah, when they get on the camera?  We need a girl that's brave that's, uh, sitting close to the ice to get her boobs on TV tonight.  Imagine, uh, like, right when someone goes to...  They've got a goal.  Yeah, or when they're slamming someone against the boards and on the other side of that plexiglass,  you just need two huge cans smashed against the melons.  That would be hysterical.  Just like the boobs in the Kentucky Fried Movie against the shower door? 
[03:06:00]  Just slam them against there, man.  I'm thinking boobs tonight.  I'm thinking it.  Yeah.  Ladies, do it.  If you do it, the Opie and Anthony show will take care of you like you can only dream up.  Should have given tickets out to what t-shirt contest winner for tonight's game.  Yeah.  I want to see boobs on TV tonight during the Stanley Cup. 
[03:06:30]  What would they do?  Huh?  They couldn't cut it.  You won't get in trouble.  Yeah.  Just gotta plop them against the glass.  Plop them against the glass.  Get on TV.  Or flop them, flop your shirt up when the camera passes you or something like that.  Get on TV.  Yeah.  The girl that does it will be completely taken care of.  Completely.  Right behind the coach's head.  You know, they were for the coach.  Yeah, they show the coach a lot.  Spread yourselves out.  One behind a penalty box.  One behind a coach.  One behind each goal. 
[03:07:00]  Not a rep.  We'll see what happens.  I bet it'll happen.  But that's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking a lady's got to step up for the team tonight.  We need this to happen.  You ready to play What Did We Learn on the Show, Anthony?  Yeah.  Okay.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  I learned old dirty stab Colonel Mustard with a Sharpie in the bathroom.  Yeah, how's my Sharpie back, you crooked? 
[03:07:30]  That's funny.  Let's see.  Don, oh, this guy learned that Don should forget about Anthony's shorts  and just get those effing pictures already.  Ponders, effing ponderous.  I also learned about the gay eye from your radio show today.  The gay eye.  The gay eye.  The process by which a male listener attending O&A's road show  fixates himself on Opie's feet and Anthony's legs. 
[03:08:00]  This ain't ponderous.  It's just plain effing scary.  The gay eye.  With all the freaking women around, you're noticing what Anthony's wearing  and that I'm wearing Tebas.  I don't know, yeah.  Yeah, you got a bunch of girls on the stage and you're looking at the gay eye.  Heywood from Yonkers.  I learned if more movies had subtitles, moviegoers would be able to see a movie in peace.  Hmm.  I believe it's never going to happen. 
[03:08:30]  Uh, Scissor from the mean streets of Greenwich.  I learned that pillows are set up for when people jump off buildings.  Stupid spick bitch.  Oh, God.  That was Scissor.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  The racial, uh, tensions on this show, from me alone, we've filled our race quota today, huh?  Yeah.  New plaintiffs.  Uh, Dave.  My God.  Dave from Jersey, I learned that you can buy movie tickets with food stamps.  Ugh.  That's brutal. 
[03:09:00]  I learned Anthony's bodyguard is a girl.  Nice shoes, precious.  All right, let's go to the phones and play.  What did we learn on the O.P. and Anthony's show today?  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Patrick, what's up?  Hey, I learned, uh, syndication Napster today.  Hmm.  Yeah, throw it on Napster.  We don't care.  Yeah, pull, yeah, we don't care.  Download our bits.  Throw them around.  That's pretty cool.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Thanks.  We love the exposure. 
[03:09:30]  Right?  Yeah.  Uh, John, what's going on?  Hello, O.P.?  Yeah.  Yeah, did you hear, uh, Psycho Mark on the radio show today?  Yeah, that, and that's, uh, we should get into it.  That's why we kind of hung up on Psycho Mark.  You know, I mean.  He's decided to go on other shows.  He doesn't need to be on our show anymore.  He tried to crack down on that guy before, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's not right, you know?  He's a radio whore.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, you guys bring him to the road shows and stuff.  All he has to do is stand there with a freaking video camera, pull out of his face. 
[03:10:00]  And that, you know, I mean, how much fun is that?  And then he screws you guys by going on other shows.  Yeah, that's all right.  He can be on the radio chick show all he wants.  That's why Black Girl's not part of this anymore.  Yeah.  He decided to go on everyone's shows.  Yeah, that's Black Girl.  All right, man.  All right.  Bye.  Barry from Jersey.  I learned Psycho Mark has to be on every show.  It's so true.  Shmoo from Queens.  I learned that Anthony's new girlfriend shops for him at the Gap in Old Navy. 
[03:10:30]  I got my own clothes.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  What's up?  How's it going?  Good.  Now you sound high.  Yeah, right.  I wish.  Now he sounds pissed off.  Well, whatever, dude.  Why are you on everyone's shows?  I am not on everyone's shows.  Everyone is calling saying you're on the radio chick show today.  Yeah.  You know what?  All right.  You don't want to know why.  Because I have to walk into the studio constantly to update stuff. 
[03:11:00]  And occasionally they'll have to maybe see me and mention my name.  But I'm not, like, going in there like Earl.  Hey, Mark.  You are so blasted.  Have you been drinking?  You are so blasted.  Who are you?  It's after 5 o'clock.  Who are you kidding?  I'm not kidding anybody.  You are so blasted right now.  Hey, I might have got the pot at the road show, but Rick took the heroin.  Mark, have you been drinking?  Have I been drinking?  Yeah.  And if I was?  No, I'm just wondering. 
[03:11:30]  No, I haven't.  Yeah, right.  I haven't.  I haven't had a sip.  Dude, you are so hammered, man.  I can tell.  That's you.  We work with you every day.  We can tell.  Oh, okay.  Look, and you can't even do the gah-gah-gah-gah or anything.  I can do it.  Gah-gah-gah.  I can do it.  Gah-gah-gah.  Don't start.  This is torture.  Torture.  You're gone, man.  All right.  Very, very good.  Torture.  It's torture.  Torture.  It's torture.  All right. 
[03:12:00]  Now say that right now.  You can't do it.  You're hammered.  Torture.  It's torture.  Torture.  It's torture.  I'm not hammered.  I wish I was.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We'll make the...  We'll decide this.  Okay.  Let's hear the sober psychomark.  Torture.  It's torture.  All right.  Now let's hear the blasted psychomark on the phone.  Torture.  It's torture.  It's torture. 
[03:12:30]  All right.  You little mess.  As I remember, this was the blasted mark.  Torture.  It's torture.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is true.  I'm sorry.  Either way.  All right.  I'm guilty.  All right, now.  See you later.  Bye.  There you go, psychomark.  Who's the tall guy?  And who's the tall guy?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, boy. 
[03:13:00]  All right.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what did you learn on the show today?  O.P.  Anthony.  Hey.  How are you doing, guys?  Good.  I learned that Anthony's adventure to the theater was indeed Mission Impossible.  Yes.  See the movie in peace.  Mission Impossible.  Impossible.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  You got it.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete?  You're next, Pete.  Precious.  Anthony, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I learned that Anthony took his girlfriend to see Mission Impossible because dinosaurs are sold out.  All right. 
[03:13:30]  Didn't you beat your first day rules?  Peace out.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what did you learn on the show?  I learned that you guys are only going to get syndicated when the blacks and the Puerto  Ricans can be quiet in the movie.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  No problem.  Later, guys.  All right.  I learned that the Olsen twins now have buds and are four years from a threesome.  Yeah.  Very good.  Actually, three years.  Seventeen's legal in this state, right?  Two years and eight months.  I hope he's watching the calendar. 
[03:14:00]  Hogflogger from the Bronx.  I learned that Ashley Olsen could stand up for her own at the movies with her new boyfriend, Anthony.  Ashley Olsen.  Fourteen.  Dan, please.  Dan, check it in.  I learned that the new Steve Kaczynski show didn't even last as long as the Kathie Lee CD  in Opie's hands.  Man.  What a mess.  Mike. 
[03:14:30]  Hey, Mike.  Yes.  What's up?  What did you learn?  You know, I originally called to tell you and talked to you about the devils, and I want  to thank you for rooting for them.  Well, that was a weak root.  Trust me.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  But at least you're staying local, you know?  I mean, hell with Dallas.  That's always been my philosophy.  You've got to stay local when it gets down to that.  But you know what?  Since I've been listening, I forgot.  I heard Psycho Mark on the morning show with his cap gun.  He did have a cap gun today.  I was listening, I guess, about quarter to ten.  Oh, my God.  He did have a cap gun today. 
[03:15:00]  And he had his cap gun, and they were laughing about it.  He's like Dennis the Menace.  He rides around here on a scooter shooting a cap gun with people.  Hi, people.  It's amazing.  It was hilarious.  I couldn't believe it.  I'm sitting here listening, and I was like, holy.  And nobody said anything about this yet.  I couldn't believe it.  He was on three shows today.  He would be on Don and Mike, but they already taped their show before it airs at seven.  Yeah, but he could have been going in and out, though.  And he's too stoned to be on Ron and Fez's show.  At 11 o'clock at night. 
[03:15:30]  Thanks, boys.  Indication, whatever.  Thank you.  Psycho Mark.  Dude, I'm trying to crank one out.  What?  What?  What did you do?  Were you on the morning show with your cap gun?  I walked in there.  Yes.  Well, you have to walk in to be on the air.  I didn't say anything.  I didn't even say anything.  I just had the gun in my hand, and they mentioned me.  Is that against the law?  Oh, man. 
[03:16:00]  Was it trial day today?  Guilty.  It's so funny.  It's so funny.  All right, Mark.  Torture.  That's torture.  That's torture.  That's torture.  All right, we got to go.  Yeah, great.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll listen for you on PLJ tomorrow.  Mike from Staten Island learned a whole bunch of S today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Opie didn't go through puberty until he got to New York.  That's pretty good.  If you're going to save someone from jumping off a building, you can use two things, a giant 
[03:16:30]  pillow or a Rockaway bed.  Spaz's Week in Review is now being read by Ack, and he does it on Tuesday.  If you can guess when the guy jumps, you win chili pepper tickets.  Syndication went, ah, F it.  Yeah.  Very good.  I learned that NEW is powered by Opie and Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  I learned that Frank from Union, New Jersey can't write one instant feedback and be happy  with it.  He's got to write a thousand of the effing things and send them in. 
[03:17:00]  Thank you, tool.  Lenny from Brooklyn.  Leave Psycho Mark alone.  He's going to be late for the Dynamite show.  All right.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned to say that you're hearing impaired when you go to the movies.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, syndication when you guys get the other half of that roast beef sandwich.  Press conference.  God damn, you're taking it way back. 
[03:17:30]  There we go.  Reference of the day?  Oh, yeah.  Obscure reference of the day.  Wow, very good.  Right on.  And we were eating roast beef.  All right.  Thanks, Tom.  Later.  Wow.  I don't think we're going to beat that one, so we should just get the hell out of here.  I learned Anthony needs a bulletproof vest at the movies, one large and one junior miss.  Oh, man.  Well, we had fun today.  Yes, we did.  We're hoping for a lady to wow at the Devil's Game tonight, live on TV.  It'll happen.  And we're also hoping to see a ton of wow signs on the highways and byways tomorrow for Whippin' 
[03:18:00]  my Wednesday, Anthony.  Come on, we'll get them out.  If you don't have the wow sticker yet, you could put a homemade sign on your car.  We love the homemade signs.  They're great.  You guys get creative with that.  And Gorilla Boy, you're doing a wow sticker stop tomorrow for us.  Yeah, Route 22 in Union back at Game Land across from Coconuts, where we were last Tuesday.  Okay.  We'll be there.  You know what time?  I believe I got to ask the vote.  I think about four o'clock.  All right, cool. 
[03:18:30]  And with that, we'll see you guys tomorrow, okay?  All right.  Down to Mike next.  To Opie and Anthony.  What are you guys about?  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, I just like one for a love.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
