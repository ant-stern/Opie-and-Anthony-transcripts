<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating humor, joking about their numerous arrests and using derogatory terms to describe themselves. They announced the expansion of their show to a Detroit FM station.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to the promotional strategy for their upcoming Cleveland show, criticizing their promoter, Pete, for suggesting deceptive marketing tactics to maintain low ticket prices.  They ultimately decided on a more honest approach regarding slow ticket sales.  The hosts discussed their new ESPN commercial, including variations with and without the word "ass," and mocked a low-scoring football game. A caller shared a humorous story about a wheelchair-bound high school student kicking a field goal.

Opie recounted his experience at a Motley Crue concert with Bill Burr and Steve, detailing humorous anecdotes about meeting the band. This transitioned into a discussion of Opie's *Deal or No Deal* obsession, focusing on a Staten Island contestant, Matty, who initially claimed to know the location of the $3 million prize but ultimately accepted a smaller amount.  Several callers contributed to the discussion, touching upon *Deal or No Deal*, low Chicago ratings, and a video of a New York weather reporter using profanity on air. The hosts also mocked Karen Meyer, a deaf reporter, for her reporting style.  The show concluded with further discussion of the commercial's success and speculation about Howard Stern's potential radio return.

The broadcast continued with a discussion about the arbitrary nature of sports fandom, using their friend Joey, a New Yorker Eagles fan, as an example, offering humorous and offensive explanations for his allegiance. They then moved on to their Dish Network-sponsored football picks contest, with a $10,000 prize, and a discussion about the randomness of predictions, leading to a conversation about the difficulty of finding a "retarded person" to make picks.  A caller corrected Opie's misuse of the word "banner" instead of "pennant." Another caller recounted a humorous anecdote about a YouTube video of Opie throwing potato chips at a woman in the studio.

The hosts expressed their aversion to medical dramas like *House*, transitioning into a discussion about true crime shows, focusing on the narration styles of Bill Curtis and the HBO *Autopsy* voiceover. The conversation shifted to prison documentaries and experiences of correctional officers, with a caller detailing inmate interventions and prison dynamics. The show then discussed a Long Island man's bulldozer rampage after a power shutoff, prompting anecdotes about power outages and unpaid bills. Callers shared their experiences with utility companies, and a hostile exchange occurred between Opie and Patrice from Texas.  Another caller, Jay from Philly, shared a story about a Black girl who spent summers with his family. The segment concluded with a news report on a high school teacher suspended for allegedly kissing students, followed by speculation about the teacher's motives. UFC fighter Chuck Liddell then appeared as a guest in studio, discussing his fighting style, career, and experiences, including a caller's claim of punching him in a bar.


The next segment focused on the continued interview with Chuck Liddell, who recounted a humorous anecdote about a fight.  He discussed MMA's evolution and his opinions on different fighting styles. Master Poe, the show's security guard, also participated in the interview. The conversation covered various aspects of Liddell's career and personal life, including a call from a seven-year-old fan.  The segment included listener calls, plugs for Liddell's fights and the Opie and Anthony tour, and replays of news reporters' verbal mistakes.

A subsequent segment began with criticism of Poe's interview questions for Chuck Liddell, described as "creepy."  The hosts read and mocked Poe's questions, comparing his writing style to Bob Kelly's.  They also speculated on Liddell's breathing during the interview.  The conversation then shifted to unrelated topics, including fabricated, graphic, and sexually violent stories involving Kenny, a show employee.  An interview with Chris Hansen of "To Catch a Predator" followed, discussing the show's popularity, legal aspects, and ethical considerations. The segment concluded with playing sexually explicit songs by Blowfly.

The final segment heavily featured Blowfly's explicit songs.  The hosts also discussed a Mets player's profanity on live TV, a sportscaster's locker room experience, and listener complaints about Trump Marina telemarketing. A caller, Wendy, shared a humorous sighting of an overweight midget at the Family Values Tour.  The segment included listener calls about various topics, including a national Do Not Call list, Opie and Anthony show marketing in Chicago, sound effects, violent video games (including one allowing the assassination of President Bush), and a new non-violent game concept.  Big Kev's interviews were mentioned, but a messed-up disc caused frustration. The broadcast ended with the "Line of the Day" segment, with Jimmy winning.  Guests mentioned in various interviews throughout this final segment included Yvonne Craig, David Naughton, the Iron Sheik, and possibly Lori Petty.

That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes. I think we're lewd. 
[00:00:30]  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model!  Anthony.  I'm dead!  James Norton.  I like yogurt!  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver!

[00:01:30]  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Yeah. What's up, Detroit?  Detroit. Does it start today?  Does it? We're officially on in Detroit. 
[00:02:00]  Officially. We weren't.  Well, we were on a sports station and they were glad to have us.  Now we're on a fine FM in Detroit.  I think it starts today. I don't know.  I didn't get a little memo or a little one sheet. No.  I found out last night I'm talking to Pete and he just happened to mention it. 
[00:02:30]  He's like, yeah, you guys are starting on Detroit on a big FM.  I'm like, really?  Pete is a douche.  Oh, no. Pete's a good boy.  I got the phone call from Pete as well.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Show moves to 97.1. Free FM in Detroit from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.  Thank you. There is the little memo.  It's a great station.  We're very happy to be on in a world.  Well, on FM in Detroit.  Absolutely. 
[00:03:00]  So I get a phone call late in the afternoon from Pete.  You know, we got the O&A traveling virus.  The last stop on the tour is this Saturday night in Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Tickets have been $10 for the last few days.  I don't know, three or four days, right?  And they're selling like hot cakes.  Hot cakes.  Cakes that are hot.  So, you know, we need an excuse to keep this $10 ticket thing going.  What was the excuse we had yesterday? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, well, I thought it wasn't an excuse.  The whole computer glitch.  The computer glitch.  There was a computer glitch.  So the computers back circuited and we had to continue.  Crash.  See, here's the reality.  You know, this is a great, great comedy show.  Yes.  And we don't want to play to an empty arena.  No.  So we got the $10 tickets going for Cleveland.  And it went so well.  You can't just stop the $10 ticket sales.  You want to keep it going.  But you need some kind of crazy excuse.  So yesterday's excuse was that the computer crashed. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And they couldn't process all the people that wanted $10 tickets for the show on Saturday night, right?  So he can't use that excuse today.  So I got a whole one sheet.  He wants us to buy into this.  Please read this, Jimmy.  From Pete.  This is what Pete wants us to say.  And make believe, like, it's off the top of our heads, off the cuff, if you will.  We had a really good response to the $10 tickets in Cleveland. 
[00:04:30]  So here's what we should do.  Talk about how we sold close to 1,000 $10 tickets.  And you guys have decided to extend the $10 promo.  Okay.  All true so far.  Tell the Cleveland fans that with all the layoffs from GM and the bad financial situation that Cleveland is in with all the lost jobs,  because you're going to forfeit your back-end percentage to keep this promo going. 
[00:05:00]  We have put an additional block of these tickets up.  I don't regards Pete.  Jesus, Pete.  That's a nice, friendly letter.  He called me yesterday and said, I got a great idea.  And he reads this thing off to me and goes, you know, just off the cuff, you guys talk about Cleveland and how they're in financial ruins.  Cleveland isn't in that bad of shape.  How manipulative. 
[00:05:30]  Why don't we just do it in honor of 9-11?  No kidding.  What's the matter with you?  Jesus, Pete.  Well, guys, in honor of all people who have died of AIDS, we're going to keep the $10 tickets going.  Oh, he just stinks.  How about this?  Why don't we just be honest?  The ticket sales in Cleveland have been a little slow.  Everywhere else, it's been unbelievable.  The sales are a little slow in Cleveland, so we want to play to a packed house.  So that's why they're $10. 
[00:06:00]  That's right.  You want to get asses in the seats, Pete.  Let's be honest here.  Let's not talk about layoffs from GM.  A little bit of honesty.  And the bad financial situation that Cleveland is in, with all the lost jobs, you're going  to forfeit your back-end percentage to keep this promo going.  Well, that might actually be true, whether we like it or not.  That might be the way we're doing it.  This is actually a special we're doing for Cleveland because they're in financial straits. 
[00:06:30]  What an ass.  Basically, if you want to go to the O&A Traveling Virus in Cleveland, at the amphitheater, right,  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yes, the tickets are $10.  $10.  You can get them through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is on opianthony.com, okay?  They did sell almost $1,000 on their $10 promotion, so.  Yeah, that's great.  No, they're selling.  There's a lot of people in the room.  They're definitely selling.  All right.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Not much, guys.  How you doing this morning? 
[00:07:00]  Hey.  Pretty good.  I just wanted to say, last night, your commercial, the full version with the A comment in there.  You can say ass, sir.  It's fine.  Network TV wouldn't allow it.  Excuse me?  You can say ass.  It's fine.  Oh, okay.  They had the full version of the commercial with the ass comment, the whole nine yards.  It was freaking awesome.  Wow.  They actually used that version?  What station?  During a football game on ESPN last night.  Oh, that's sweet. 
[00:07:30]  Right at halftime, sir.  Yeah, some of them are using that.  Some of the other ones that don't want to use the ass comment are using the other one,  the dress comment.  Of course, Rob is talking about the Opie and Anthony TV commercial.  You can see it for yourself on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  But during the game last night, they had the version with ass.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Shit game, but...  Why did you have to say that, sir?  Yeah, you didn't say...  Why?  You asked about the ass word, and then you throw out the S word. 
[00:08:00]  I'm sorry, guys.  All right.  Well, the game was...  Oh, shut up!  Yeah, why would Opie want to talk?  You just go ahead and do a comment on the game.  It was a bore fest last night.  Who played?  Steelers lost.  Hey, come on.  9.3 field goals.  That's a game you want to watch.  It was a bore fest.  Lowest scoring game in Monday Night Football history.  We'll just have a 9-0.  9-0.  9-0. 
[00:08:30]  Three field goals.  Three field goals.  Yuck.  Sorry, Pittsburgh.  I like the field goals.  The field goals are lost art form.  I'm stealing your character.  What character?  I like the field goals.  I do, too.  That's their stupid voice.  Fighting.  Who talks that way?  Let's go to Ken in Indianapolis.  Wait, one time for our high school had a boy in a wheelchair kicking the field goal.  His family sued and won.  I like the helmet with one little bar.  It's not as intimidating.  Dating.  Yes.  It's easy to kiss your grandmother wearing that helmet, as I would frequently do before 
[00:09:00]  games.  We got more info on Cleveland.  Ken in Indianapolis.  Yes, Ken.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, not only is Ken a douche for just a ridiculous idea, but the jackass doesn't even know there  isn't any GM jobs in Cleveland.  The closest plant's in Toledo.  What a dolt.  All right.  Punch it out, boys.  We know what it is.  Pete said that after Michael Moore did that special about his hometown of Cleveland, that 
[00:09:30]  we really should honor all the oil they lost.  Of course.  Jesus, Pete.  Pete's one phone call away from me never answering the phone again when he calls.  He is so close.  I allowed him into the inner circle of very few phone calls that I actually answer, and he's  about to go to voicemail forever.  Oh, no.  Pete.  He really is.  Voicemail hell.  That's when he never picks up or returns the call.  What a stupid idea. 
[00:10:00]  I have a few people on that.  Huh.  The voicemail.  Yeah.  Voicemail hell.  Yeah.  See the number and go.  Click.  Volume down.  Back in the pocket.  I love Pete.  He took me to see Motley Crue last night, and it was very enjoyable.  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  They did the Hard Rocks, 35th anniversary here, and it was great, dude.  Yeah.  I haven't seen them in probably almost 20 years.  Some of the Aussie, like, mid-80s, and they were great. 
[00:10:30]  Was it them?  It was them and Aerosmith, right?  No, no.  Aerosmith was.  They're touring with Aerosmith.  They could do it tonight in Jones Beach.  Oh, okay.  That was a small venue for them.  They looked like they really were having fun.  They sounded great, and at the end, Stephen Tyler came up and sang Hell to Skelter.  To close it out with, that was great, dude.  I mean, I was with Bill Burr and Steve, and we're probably maybe 25 feet away.  I love when Steve is, like, trying to show you that he's not drunk.  I'm going to.  I have to go home now because I have to wake up.  He sounds like Steve doing an impersonation of Steve. 
[00:11:00]  That's how you know he's been tipping a few back.  I didn't witness it.  I only heard it.  I wasn't drunk.  I didn't say you were drunk.  I was maintaining.  Yeah.  I better get up early.  I was in full panic mode.  1020 rolled around, and I just kept looking at my watch.  I got to wake up.  I got to wake up.  I got to wake up.  Well, I went back and got pictures, of course, and I had them all, and I was in the dressing  room with Nicky Six and Vince Neil.  Oh, yeah?  And Nicky, they were trying to get a picture with him, but he was, like, distracted and  getting ready.  Oh, no. 
[00:11:30]  He's like, uh...  Must have driven you nuts.  No, yeah, I was, but he was just getting ready to go on, man.  He wasn't being a dick.  And he's like, uh...  I said, Tommy Lee and Mick Mars in one dressing room, and they were great.  Um...  Got pictures, and then, uh, Vince Neil.  And then...  And then Nicky's like, ah, we'll do it when I come off, man.  Oh, no.  That's the big blow-off.  I didn't mind.  Well, no, but he actually did.  I waited like a little boy until the very end.  Because you waited.  That's...  I thought of you, actually.  Excuse me.  Let me rephrase that.  To a normal, non-psychopath, that's a blow-off. 
[00:12:00]  Where you hear it and just walk away.  Jimmy will wait for you.  Yeah.  I did.  Because you told him.  Right.  Dude, I was like a three-year-old at the end when he's walking by.  Because he was, like, kind of like...  Why?  Did you drown in Tommy's pool afterwards?  He walked by.  I go, uh, Nicky, um, you said to wait for after we could do a picture?  Oh, you did.  Believe me, I got the douche jokes just thinking.  Remember, you said, all of a sudden you put the responsibility on him.  But he was like, oh, yeah, sure, man, fine.  He was cool.  And why do you think of me?  Because I had to hang out and wait. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And you wanted to spit on me.  But I had to do it.  Yeah.  At the whole band, I was so happy.  Wow, nice one.  I really enjoyed it.  The last concert Jimmy and I went to together was Metallica.  Never again, unfortunately.  You can't go in the same car with me, because I will say.  He'll wait and wait and wait.  I waited against the wall backstage for two hours so he could get his Metallica pictures.  Just get his pictures.  It was a long, long night.  I saw Jimmy walk in last night, and I was sitting with Bill Burr, and I was trying to  get Jim's attention, and it took, I shouted his name a few times, Jim, hey, Jim.  And I realized he was making a beeline for backstage, and there was nothing I could do 
[00:13:00]  short of sawing his legs off that was going to make him stop.  Dude, you got to.  I mean, it's very rare you get into a small venue like that, like where we know everybody,  and where your agent is back there.  That's really rare.  Dennis put me right into the dressing rooms, which is cool.  Right, right.  It was cool.  All right.  More info on Cleveland.  It's Brett.  Brett, what's up?  Hey, that one guy who called said there was no plant in Cleveland?  Yeah.  He's full of it.  I mean, Cleveland's even got a road called Chevy Boulevard.  There is a plant in Cleveland, and Cleveland has been noted as the poorest city in the country 
[00:13:30]  now.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  You got $10 tickets for Saturday's show.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right, Brett.  Not a lot of revenue coming out of that Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It should be now.  Jason in Cleveland, what's up?  What's going on, you guys?  I just want to see.  I'm really excited about the $10 tickets.  Yeah, cool.  Get a few of them, will you?  I spent all my money on XM Radio this weekend in strippers.  All right.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:14:00]  No problem.  All right.  Let's go to Jimmy's Foot.  Jimmy's Foot, what's up?  Jimmy's Foot.  Opie, meet the Mets.  Meet the Mets.  Step right up and greet the Mets.  That's right.  Opie, come on.  You can't even curse that.  You've got to believe.  That's right.  You've got to believe.  Ugh.  Schaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one. 
[00:14:30]  Do you have that new Mets song, the Our Team, Our Time?  Oh, is that horrid.  I got it.  That song stinks.  Let me go old school.  Ah.  Meet the Mets.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Come on up and greet the Mets.  Bring your kitties.  Bring your wife.  Guaranteed to have the time of your life.  Okay.  Terrific.  Because the Mets are really sucking the ball.  Are they?  Knocking those home runs over the wall. 
[00:15:00]  Uh-huh.  All east side, west side.  Everybody's coming down.  To meet the NETS Mets.  The New York Town.  New York Town.  That's right.  The little village of New York City.  People on the streets.  Where do they go?  To meet the Mets.  Yeah.  Hold that hollow.  Wow.  The second verse that you never really heard.  No.  Where do they go?  Yeah.  The Mets clinched last night.  Meet the Mets. 
[00:15:30]  Hit those home runs over the wall.  Show your kids from Long Island what a colored man looks like.  Meet the Mets.  Yanks are going down this year.  That's right.  They're going down.  That's right.  That's slow down.  Slow down.  I know the Mets fans are very happy and everything, but just keep focused.  It says right on the front page of the paper, Toast of the Town, Mets clinched first division  title in 18 years.  Yes, they did.  That's right.  18 years since 1988. 
[00:16:00]  All right, Jimmy's foot.  Thank you.  Thank you, all people.  Jimmy's foot.  The foot thing on his foot.  Jake in Jersey, what's up?  Oh, how do you know the football game was boring?  You should have been watching the Mets.  I was all over the TV last night.  First of all, I did not watch the Mets clinched.  I had to see the highlights this morning when I got up.  And he's got a remote.  He's got picture in picture.  Because it was a school night.  I took a peek at the Steelers.  I took a peek at the Mets.  And what I really watched last night, I got hooked on that dumb deal or no deal. 
[00:16:30]  Anyone else see this?  No one.  No.  No.  No one saw deal or no deal.  I have shunned the show.  Why?  It's just not one I've gotten into.  There are reality shows and other shows and game shows out there.  Some of us are into them.  Some of them have no clue what happens in these things.  Deal or no deal is one I don't watch.  You don't watch the Hell's Kitchen.  No.  See?  That's how I feel about deal or no deal.  Cooking shows are for faggots. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't even want to argue.  I'm not going to argue.  I've sat there and sometimes I go, why am I watching a cooking show?  Because the guy is calling the women a fat cows.  Maybe that's why I watch it.  Hell's Kitchen, it has an edge.  I've checked it out a little bit.  It's all right.  But I haven't watched deal or no deal.  Deal or no deal is the simplest game in TV history.  Simplest TV game in history.  And I'm hooked.  Flip a coin.  It's pretty much flip a coin, isn't it?  Pretty much. 
[00:17:30]  And it's doing ridiculous ratings.  Yeah.  But they had this guy from Staten Island.  We've got to get him on the phone.  I have a feeling he listens to this radio show.  He looks the type.  He's a teamster.  He's been a teamster for 23 years.  There you go.  He's been married for 23 years.  He got married at 23.  Yeah.  What case did he pick?  Well, I don't want to spoil it.  Of course not.  It was amazing.  Because I usually try to go to bed around between 9 and 9.30. 
[00:18:00]  And I'm taking a peek at this Matty guy on deal or no deal.  Pretty much the season premiere, I believe, last night.  Three million up for grabs.  You know the game, right?  There's like, I think, 26 cases.  Yeah.  And there's dollar amounts in all the cases.  It could be anything from a penny all the way up in this case to three million dollars.  Hot broads with the cases.  I still have no idea how the game works, though.  Which is nice eye candy.  What do you just got to go?  I picked that one.  Well, you come out and you pick a case. 
[00:18:30]  And let's say you pick case 7.  So then you take the case with the number 7 on it and you place it right next to you.  And then you have to start eliminating other cases.  See, that's where it gets confusing.  Why?  How do you eliminate?  You go take away.  Well, how he goes, all right, you have to pick five cases, let's say.  So you pick five numbers and they open the case.  And, you know, it could be a million dollars.  It could be a biggie.  It could be a biggie or it could be the case with a penny.  Yeah.  And then, you know, depending on what's left on the board, then the banker calls and then he offers you a buyout, basically. 
[00:19:00]  It's the simplest game.  And so, see that case sitting next to you?  No.  I'll pay you.  Yeah, yeah.  Like $15,000.  $15,000 for it.  And you go, no deal.  And then the crowd goes crazy.  And then Howie goes, all right, now you got to pick another three cases.  You got to eliminate another three cases.  And depending on, you know, what's left on the board, your money goes up from the banker.  I want to see a contestant sneeze in Howie's face and watch him just faint away.  Age or no age. 
[00:19:30]  They all fist him.  They give him a little fist.  Do they?  Yeah.  They give him the fist handshake thing.  So we, this is really quick.  We meet Matty last night.  I was just so hooked on this stupid deal and no deal last night.  Here's Matty from Staten Island.  Matthew Salina.  Matthew.  Yeah.  What's up?  I love you, baby.  Come on.  Yeah.  Baby.  Come on. 
[00:20:00]  Baby.  Oh.  Wow.  Look at you.  What an ass.  I'm going to make him sweat today, baby.  Are you really?  Okay.  Now.  God knows where Hoffa is.  All the way down to 110.  They were randomly replaced in all the cases.  We don't know which one holds what.  I need you to pick the one that you think has, as you call it, the three million dollars.  Funny.  Well, I'm married for 23 years.  I'm a teamster for 23 years.  I got married at 23 and I'm born on the 23rd. 
[00:20:30]  23's for me, baby.  Take 15.  Thank you.  Three million dollars here.  So he picks case number 23.  Uh-huh.  Out of 26 cases.  It's next to him now.  And he goes, the three million is in this case.  Okay.  And then he has to start eliminating, you know, cases, right?  Right.  Let's start by opening six.  Uh, five kids.  I take case number five. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  Ursula.  Ursula.  Come on, Ursula.  Open the case.  Let's start with a penny.  Let's make this nice.  Come on, Ursula.  Come on.  How is that?  Get out of the back of the penny.  I'm the first.  I'm good at this.  I'm good at this.  There was a penny.  He said, start with a penny and there was a penny in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Out of the 25 cases that are left.  This sounds a little fishy.  He already said, like, case number 23 that's right next to him has the three million. 
[00:21:30]  Now he has to eliminate cases.  He goes, all right, that case, whatever number he picked, I don't remember already.  He goes, that will be the penny.  So the Goomba from Staten Island figures out, knows exactly what's in every case?  Yeah.  That seems just a tad fishy.  The teamster.  The teamster.  The fix is in.  Yeah.  And the show, yes, Dave, from Jersey, the show has the hottest models.  We all know that.  That's probably the biggest reason to watch the show.  That's it. 
[00:22:00]  They have good eye candy.  So then the game goes on and on and on.  It gets really, really exciting.  And then finally, Howie gives them another deal or no deal.  You know, the buyout.  Right.  It went up.  Let's go to the name.  $675,000.  They're offering him $675,000.  Because he still has the $3 million on the board somewhere, possibly.  So at that point, you've got to know, oh, that it's up there somewhere or next to you. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  This game is silly.  At this point, there was five, I believe.  Two really low numbers and then three really high numbers, including the $3 million.  Yeah.  But there's two real crap numbers, too.  Exactly.  You could go away with, in this case, I think it was a dollar.  Ooh.  A dollar and $50.  And then there was $3 million in one of the cases.  He had the inside edge.  $675,000, $3 million, and one of the high amounts. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  So you could say no deal, but then you're going to have to eliminate a couple more cases,  and now you could take the $3 million away.  Okay?  This is what Maddie decides.  Maddie.  Deal or no deal?  Deal.  No deal.  No deal.  No deal.  The audience yells deal.  No deal.  $675,000 is a lot of money.  I want that $3 million that's in here.  Yeah.  No deal.  No deal.  No deal.  No deal.  One deal. 
[00:23:30]  No deal.  No deal.  No deal.  So he bails.  He bails and says, I'll take the $675,000.  And he goes, even though the $3 million is in the case I picked at the beginning of the  show.  Remember, $23,000.  Right.  $23,000.  $23,000.  So why wasn't he so confident?  He bailed on it?  Well, because if he didn't take the deal, he has to eliminate two other cases.  And, you know, he could pick a number, and next thing you know, the $3 million is  out of the game.  Just let him stick with what he got next year.  To you?  But you don't know.  Take your commitment. 
[00:24:00]  You've taken your case.  It's all a guess.  So this is what happens at the end of the show, which is just amazing.  It's down, I think, two cases left.  Because then they play it out.  Like, all right, if you didn't take the money, what was the next case you would have?  That's always good when they play it out.  You're facing it.  Yeah, they go, all right, if you didn't take the deal, all right, you would have to eliminate  another case.  What number?  And they play it back and forth, okay?  Yeah.  And then it's down to the last two cases.  I used to love when they did that on Pyramid.  Right, right.  The $25,000 Pyramid, even though the person lost, they would sit there, and Dick Clark would 
[00:24:30]  get behind him and go, how things do you row a boat with?  You row a boat, how a piston moves up and down, motion you make to satisfy yourself.  Oh, no one's getting the, okay, thank you.  Because he's in the First Nation.  So it's down to two cases, okay?  I think it was the real victim.  Down to two, I mean, now they're playing it out. 
[00:25:00]  There's two cases left.  The one he has in front of him, the 23, case number 23, and one on the board.  One has the dollar, and the other has the $3 million.  This is how it played out.  There are only two cases left in play, Matty.  Yes.  It's $1 and $3 million.  Oh, my gosh.  If this is the $1, you would have made a great deal.  $3 million.  It's the $3 million, Howie.  They're ready to open up his case.  Of course.  They're saying, you know, if it's a dollar in his case, he made a great deal by bailing 
[00:25:30]  at $6.75.  The way this guy sounds, there should be severed legs, a torso.  I love this guy.  He's one of our own, I'm telling you.  I guarantee this guy listens on a regular basis.  $3 million?  It's the $3 million, Howie.  What is it?  Matty?  You made...  Home.  Not such a great deal.  Oh.  He picked the $3 million case to start the show. 
[00:26:00]  And said he...  He said he picked it.  Oh.  You know what, though?  And it was like 23 because he's been married 23 years.  A teamster for 23 years.  His birthday is on the 23rd.  He told 23 people. 
[00:26:30]  He was 23 when he got married.  He picks it and says, the $3 million is in here.  He had all the confidence in the world.  And in the end, it was the $3 million.  Poor Matty, because for the rest of his life, he's going to regret that.  Yeah.  But it's like, if it comes down to, you win $3 million or $1.  Right.  Yeah.  That really is an ugly choice.  There's a lot of room for error in there.  He walked away with the biggest winnings ever.  $675,000.  You can't pitch about that.  That was the right move to make, man.  How are you supposed to know?  The show is so stupid and so simple, but I can't get enough of it for some reason. 
[00:27:00]  I would think.  I think it's because Howie's a great game show host.  If they're offering you that much money to back out, they know you got that bag next to you.  But then again, one of the cases might have been, say, $900,000 or $1,000,001.  And they work off the board.  You can tell.  They have a nice thing.  You can see on the right is the higher numbers.  I'll watch it one of these days.  And then the left side has the lower numbers. 
[00:27:30]  So if you have a lot of lower number cases left, then the offer from the bank isn't going to be as large.  Oh, I got you.  He still had $3,000,000 somewhere on the board or in the case in front of him.  So that's why the bank was offering him ridiculous money to get out.  Gotcha.  It tells you what amounts are left.  Like you know what amounts are left in the cases.  They have a whole board.  Like, okay.  All right.  That makes more sense now.  Yeah.  Stupid game. 
[00:28:00]  But there you go.  Maddie from Staten Island.  When you're watching.  I was in the gym with them watching.  And you have to see how it plays out.  You're like, ugh.  I can't go upstairs.  I know.  It's so annoying.  I don't know why.  Because they really show you what would have happened.  Right.  And you want to know what would have happened.  Yeah.  That's like going through your evening and someone could show you the bar and go, all right,  this is what would have happened.  If you would have talked to her, you would have done nothing.  Oh, now there's the game.  If you would have talked to her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good point.  You get the $1 check.  But it's pretty much a coin toss.  We're watching a coin toss on TV now. 
[00:28:30]  He's going to feel for the rest of his life, if only, if only.  But that was the move to me.  But he'll be all happy about it.  Hey, I walked away with 600 grand.  I left the taxes.  I made it $280.  It's not so bad.  I had fun.  I was on the TV.  You know, where's my gun?  I'm going to shoot myself.  $3 million or $1.  How does it come down to that?  Yeah.  If it comes down to $1 million or $3 million, you made a bad deal.  Yeah.  But if it comes down to $3 million or a buck. 
[00:29:00]  Or a buck.  All the commercials said it's the best one so far.  They were just ranting and raving how great this season premiere deal or no deal was going to be.  I bet a buck.  Someone said he reminded me of Peter from Family Guy.  Yeah.  Also, Eric in New York.  What do you got real fast?  He's just a stereotypical guido.  And did you see the two daughters?  Was there something wrong with the two twins?  We were trying to figure out if they were midgets. 
[00:29:30]  It looked like they were midgets to me.  There's definitely something wrong with them.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right, bud.  Something wrong.  They had the dad's attitude.  Andy in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  It's like an NBA game.  You watch the first five minutes, the last five minutes, and everything in between is nonsense.  You know how it all worked out.  Yeah, because, you know, when the banker calls with the early deals, they're so stupid.  Everyone says no, because the first, you know, buyout is like $20,000.  It's like, no, man.  There's still a million on the board, at least, you know? 
[00:30:00]  All right, Andy.  Thanks.  All right.  Be cool.  We got to take a break.  The banker calls.  The banker.  He's really a banker.  No, he's not.  He's an exec producer.  Of course he is.  I would like to offer you a deal.  You can have $3 million, or would you like to keep this bag of spinach?  Topical.  All right.

[00:31:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I guess ratings came in for New York yesterday.  Yes.  Yesterday.  The comeback continues.  Yes, it does.  We did quite well.  Very happy.  Thank you for supporting us on this fine radio station.  Thank you.  Chicago is still a 0.00.  Well, I don't know if we're even on that one yet. 
[00:32:00]  Like, as far as the ratings go.  Does anybody remember when we started in Chicago?  Here's how we should find out.  Yeah.  Does any listeners remember when we started in Chicago?  Well, if no one's listening, they won't remember.  It doesn't have to be in Chicago.  Other people will remember things.  They're saying the rating in Chicago is a 0.00.  That means no one is listening.  No one's listening.  So if we get one call from Chicago, that proves that the ratings are a big lie.  Flawed.  No one listening in Chicago?  Let's be honest.  It's going to be a slow build for Chicago. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, it's going to be a tough one.  But we're up for the challenge.  Damn right.  It's sad that we make fun of Karen Meyer, their deaf hometown hero.  Maybe that's it.  Speaking of which.  Oh, good.  Let's see.  We got a little of her.  Well, we never got to the end of this thing.  We didn't finish her story on, what the hell was it?  Damn it.  On Burn Victims.  Burn Victims.  By the way, I couldn't get enough of the Weather Girl video from yesterday.  We couldn't play it over here.  We played it on XM. 
[00:33:00]  Audrey Puentes.  Yeah.  Something like that.  She does weather here in New York.  It's on YouTube.  And it's on YouTube.  How do you search that thing?  Can you put the C word in the search engine of YouTube?  I don't know.  It's one of the worst search.  All these things have really bad search engines.  Hard to find what you're looking for.  Dan, do you know?  Searching for the weather woman audio?  Yes.  It's called Freudian slip or something for weather. 
[00:33:30]  Really?  So you have to know what the clip is called.  I don't know.  It's something about a weather woman, and she slips and says the C word.  It's on our website?  How do I put that in?  Screw that.  It's on opiananthony.com.  All right.  We played the audio yesterday on our XM show.  Can't play it over here because the FCC doesn't like that kind of thing.  But instead of saying rip currents, she said rip.  Rip.  C word.  And then used the bad word. 
[00:34:00]  Clear as day.  And it was great.  Clear as day.  Oh.  I watched that video, I don't know, a dozen times in the show yesterday.  Oh, it did she trip up.  She was a pro, though, right?  She didn't even bat an eye.  Yeah, she just kept going.  Cloud right through.  Cloud right through, right.  Amazing.  And she's not going to get in trouble for that?  I guess not.  I'm glad she's not, but it's amazing how the guy slipped and said Martin Luther Kuhn.  Yeah.  And he was fired instantly.  Yeah, and you could tell that was a slip.  Yeah, for a politically incorrect slip, but a female slips and drops a C-bomb, and no one 
[00:34:30]  hears anything.  It's like on page 26 of the Post today, racist animal gets a life sentence, the black guy  that said he wanted to go out and kill a white person.  Yeah.  Page 26 of the New York Post, Fat Nick hit a guy with a bat who was in his neighborhood  to steal a car.  He was on the front page every day.  For weeks.  Yeah.  It's just, the media should just, they should all be executed.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Bunch of liars.  Yeah.  And insincere jerk-offs. 
[00:35:00]  They wouldn't, why don't they cover the black guy with the same fervor they do the white  person?  It's because you expect blacks to act like that.  That's how the liberal media is.  All right.  They expect it.  So go to opandanthony.com for the video of Rip, or saying Rip sees.  It's hilarious.  Instead of Rip currents.  Let's go to Steve in Chicago.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, but listen, this is day one. 
[00:35:30]  In Chicago?  No, I'm in New York.  Go away.  Look at that.  Come on, man.  Another Steve in Chicago.  Don't trick us, man.  Steve.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Make it fast.  We got to get to Karen Meyer.  All right.  It's been about a month and a half you guys been in Chicago.  Okay.  A month and a half.  Yeah.  Yeah, it comes on in about another 15 minutes is what it starts on 105.9, but I still listen  to it on XM.  All right.  Oh, we're a little bit, we started, what, early August, right? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  I guess it'll be a month and a half.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Not even a blip.  Thank you, Steve.  We need some time to get people listening, because we're still in the last person's numbers,  I think.  Look at me talking ratings.  All right.  Let's get into the Karen Meyer thing.  We played the first clip, and we never got to the rest of them, so we'll replay the first  clip and finally do the rest of it, okay?  Karen Meyer is this deaf reporter.  She's deaf.  She's a reporter.  Let's handle this one with dignity. 
[00:36:30]  She's got courage.  I agree.  For the new people listening, let's handle this in a way we would never handle it.  She's got courage.  She has courage.  This is a wonderful, touching story.  She does all the special needs, special needs folks reporting any type of an injury for Chicago.  People that would be considered handy-capable.  Handy-capable.  Good point.  Handy-capable.  I know what to say.  Very sensitive.  She's deaf.  Hearing impaired. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  She's hearing impaired.  Hearing impaired.  Oh, I'm sorry to use such an insensitive word as deaf.  Do they do the old subtitles and all that?  I would assume they do the subtitles.  Not familiar.  I haven't seen any video of her, but it would be helpful to the viewers at home.  It would be nice to ask someone from Chicago, but no one's listening.  Oh, they'll call in momentarily.  They better.  So, yeah, she's doing a report on burn victims.  Poor people.  I cannot believe they're getting away with this.  It's a modern-day freak show is all it is. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with her being a good reporter.  Their people do.  Their people do.  Some burn victims feel like social outcasts because of their scars.  One Chicago-area survivor wants people to know they are just like everyone else.  ABC7's Karen Meyer is here with more.  Karen?  Today, Sophia, from a medical standpoint, the experiences can be growing.  From a psychological perspective, it can be more traumatizing.  Can it? 
[00:38:00]  What is the difference between boogers and broccoli with little kids?  Oh, pause.  I know the answer.  Broccoli isn't horribly burned.  I bet that's not it.  The kid's doing the old poo-ha joke.  I know.  That's a dirty joke.  That old gag.  That's how they make you feel better about your ailment is they send her over and you're like,  all right, well, I may always look surprised and I may have no lashes and I wince when I see vinegar, 
[00:38:30]  but at least I don't sound like this idiot.  Burn victims always look like they're yodeling.  Do we ever say that on the show?  Baby.  Here we go.  Queens, boogers, and broccoli with little kids.  Kids want to eat broccoli.  14-year-old Lonnie Boyd has an amazing personality, especially considering everything he's been through. 
[00:39:00]  My brother's, Devin's birthday, 1995, our house caught fire, and there was no way for us to get out, so we were trapped.  He and Devon got out, but not their two-month-old sister Stormy.  Do me a favor.  They're yodeling. 
[00:39:30]  That's what's going through his head the whole time she's talking.  This is funny.  He despise yodeling.  Do we have to play the rest of the clips?  They're really depressing.  I think we do.  Yes, we do.  We like goofing on her for being a deaf reporter on TV.  I want to hear depressing clips.  Completely ridiculous.  I'm pissed today, and I want to hear it.  It's so awful that they give a person who's deaf only people with problems.  Yeah.  So why don't you get a Jewish guy and only let him deal with stories about Jews or a black – it's like just – 
[00:40:00]  They do.  How do they do that?  They do in New York.  They give the black guy the black stories.  Only the black neighborhoods.  Hispanic reporter the Hispanic stories.  Yeah.  They go into the neighborhood and, you know, talk about the problem with the people that are similar to them.  So now you get a handicapped person, has to do the handicapped stories.  All right.  Here we go.  Handicapable.  80% of Lonnie's body was burned. 
[00:40:30]  Ow.  He and his brother became patients at Lauer Bida Children's Hospital on Chicago's South Side.  I had to go through a lot of surgery.  We had exercises.  I went through a lot of things.  Emotional distress, guilt, all different types of things.  They had to wear what's referred to as Joves, the skin tight.  Grandmother George Murray says it was hard for the boys to grow up.  They would have to go out into the community with these masks. 
[00:41:00]  And honestly, other children would become so frightened.  But my heart would always just ache inside.  Yes, stick up, man.  And they felt rejected because of how they look.  So they have learned to, if someone's staring at them, they've learned to come up and say,  Hi, I'm Devin.  I'm Lonnie.  I'm a burned survivor.  How are you?  Ah! 
[00:41:30]  From someone's cell phone, Karen Meyer sounds like she just got done running a marathon race  and is severely out of breath.  Oh, my God.  And they do use subtitles?  Yeah, I guess so.  They would have to.  I only pick up a word or two here and there.  I know.  I can't understand her.  Dr. Brian Stolbach is the child psychologist at Lower Bida.  He says a significant part of the healing process for burn patients is dealing with other people. 
[00:42:00]  Because they look different, because they look scary, and a lot of burn survivors find ways to educate people about what's happened to them  and the fact that they're not scary and the fact that they're not scary and the fact that they're not scary and people don't have to be scared around them.  Lonnie and his brother divine are incredible survivors.  I think in some ways a perfect example of people who have had a horrible experience and not let it define them and have moved on from it and yet still will talk about it, will share about it in a way that can help other people that go through similar things. 
[00:42:30]  And he'll tell you, he'll tell you, I'm a handsome guy.  I'll say, you are.  You are.  You're a very handsome guy. 
[00:43:00]  You're a handsome guy.  Probably not the right message to be sending.  No.  It's very sad that he's a burn victim.  Maybe he could say that you're a funny guy.  Funny.  A chess player.  Personality.  Intelligent.  You're great on a phone.  Don't get the kid's hopes up.  Yeah, yeah.  You might want to.  Don't give him false confidence.  You've got a sparkling personality.  Maybe I am handsome.  You've got a great sense of humor. 
[00:43:30]  You're going to go out without the mask today.  You have a caring heart.  You hum nicely.  You, uh, uh, you're great during a blackout.  You scare little children.  I mean, uh.  Oh.  You, uh, do you really want to give him, like, that false confidence to walk up?  He'll have, like, the little, like, the, uh, the derby.  Kind of tilted to the side.  That's just the style.  Yeah.  Hey.  I'm a handsome man.  Hello, girls.  Ah. 
[00:44:00]  All right.  She wraps up here.  Later this month, Lonnie will be joining his brother at Loyola Academy and where Matt, and  like most freshmen, he's nervous.  For more information, go to our website, abc7ticago.com.  Great kiss.  Yes.  Inspirational.  Very nice.  Thanks, Karen.  Shut up.  Here's the, uh, question I have.  He's burned when he was, like, three, right?  If you're burned when you're really young, how come you stay burned, like, when you're  18, like, doesn't your skin stretch a little bit? 
[00:44:30]  Like, when you're a baby, there's only a little bit of skin on you.  Yeah.  Like, that amount of skin doesn't cover an adult torso.  Hmm.  So do you grow out of it, like, where just a little area becomes burned?  How does that work?  I don't know.  That's an interesting question.  Might be like a balloon, you know?  Just stretches?  Yeah.  If you put a little mark on a balloon and then blow the balloon up, the mark gets bigger.  Yeah, but that balloon isn't regenerating new tissue all the time, I don't think. 
[00:45:00]  Hmm.  It's only the same amount being blown up with skin.  Isn't it regenerating?  Like, you know, just...  Great.  Now we get 18 people that think they're doctors calling with 18 different answers.  Um, I, uh, no.  Right, right.  It's, uh...  All right.  Dustin in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, they should tell a little fella he has a face for radio.  That old gag.  You have a great sense of humor.  Um, you don't have to wear a costume on Halloween.  I, I mean, uh, uh, you're a kind person. 
[00:45:30]  Let's say hi to Ass F.  Ass F.  Can't get nose prints on the window when you're looking out of the window real close in the wintertime.  Oh, no.  No.  Hey, line, line of the day.  Yeah.  For Jimmy.  Yeah.  Winch when I see vinegar.  That is a good nomination.  Yeah, Jimmy raised the bar early today.  We're going to have to try to beat that.  Uh, let's go to Cody in Indiana.  Cody.  Hey, buddy. 
[00:46:00]  Hey.  Uh, yeah.  I, I get Chicago stations where I'm at.  There's, uh, there are subtitles when she talks.  She talks with her hands.  So not only can the people who are normal, they can't tell what she's saying by hearing her,  but they don't speak sign language.  So that's out.  And she has a retard haircut.  All right.  Thank you.  Hell, guys, Steve.  Yep.  Bye-bye.  I want to see a picture of Karen Meyer.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  It's kind of ironic, don't you think, that somebody has to figure out what she's saying  so they can put up the closed captioning, right?  Okay. 
[00:46:30]  Here's what the deaf reporter's saying.  That's kind of ironic.  The old Brian Regan bit?  Yeah.  Here's what the whales are saying.  She's lonely.  She's lonely.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  When stressed in the morning.  Suppressed memories.  Every day.  Hollow.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  Good morning.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-3.  Let's say hi to Don.  Don, what's going on today, man?  Is that Don on the phone?  Hey, Don.  Hey, how you doing?  All right, Don.  You guys rock.  Me and my wife, we're chilling out watching TV last night, and we're surfing around.  And all the time, we see this commercial.  And I was looking at the girl.  I go, boy, she's large.  And all the time, she says, does this dress make me look fat? 
[00:47:30]  And all the time, I see you guys say, it's not the dress.  It was freaking hilarious.  The not the dress line.  All right.  There's a lot of versions out there of our commercial.  Yeah, we're getting rave reviews on the O.P. and Anthony commercial, by the way.  I guess Ad Age gave it some award or something?  Yeah, it was like Ad of the Week.  Ad of the Week?  Yeah.  I'm surprised CBS, if they shot it, like CBS is behind it, why wouldn't they make them show it on their networks?  Or is it maybe the affiliates that are a problem?  It's just the word ass.  I don't remember what you're going on. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, there's even a funnier version, I got to tell you, Don, where Anthony says, it's your fat ass or what is it?  It's your big fat ass.  It's your huge ass that makes you look fat.  Yeah, there you go.  But I'm glad they're showing, you know, the commercial now, finally.  We made that two months ago now?  It's a huge ass that makes you look fat.  How did your parents die?  It's a huge ass that makes you look fat.  How did your parents die?  Why not?  All the versions of the commercial are up on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search. 
[00:48:30]  Thanks, Don.  I'm glad you liked the commercial.  Peace out, guys.  All right, let's say hi to Dan in Jersey.  Dan, what's up?  Dan.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hi, Dan.  Hey, listen, man.  What's up with this retard on friggin' in the post, man?  He's coming back to the air again or something like that?  Well, Howard tells so many lies.  You don't know which is true and which is just a made-up story.  To try to get back into the news and then into the public eye.  He sees what's going on.  Here's what's happening. 
[00:49:00]  He sees what's happened to our show.  We do both.  We do satellite and we do terrestrial radio.  And he sees that we're getting a lot of interviews.  We're doing letterman.  We're in the news every day about what's going on with this program,  picking up new markets, things like that.  And he's pretty much fading away.  They're writing articles about him, but it's about how he's fading away,  how he's not getting as many subs as they thought.  It's all negative news. 
[00:49:30]  So I think they came across with this plan to put out a rumor,  get a rumor started that he might do the same thing.  But as far as it actually happening, I don't know.  I can't see serious pain.  Yeah, you tell it.  To be honest with you, he's just terrible.  I think he sucks.  To be honest with you.  Oh, Dan's the radio expert.  Thank you, Dan.  And also, your commercial was awesome.  I see it on Sportsnet New York, man. 
[00:50:00]  Right on, sir.  Funny-ass commercial, bro.  Oh, cool.  Thank you, Dan.  All right, bro.  Have fun.  You know, to be honest with you, XM not paying us half a billion dollars.  I'll be honest.  Not paying us half a billion dollars.  So as far as the exclusivity thing goes and, you know, renting us out like hookers, that's fine.  It works.  It works for them.  I don't know of any radio company that can really cough up that much money to take away the exclusivity of how we... 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, but you guys also are making a comeback.  We are making a comeback from 26 months...  Extinction.  ...being off the air.  Yeah, man.  Exactly.  It's not like there was a decision made in the middle of things being okay, going, all right, we're going to go here to Satellite.  And then after a year going, ah, what happened?  We've got to go back now.  It would look stupid to go back.  But with all that said and done, if he does, welcome.  We say bring it on.  Welcome back.  Bring it on! 
[00:51:00]  Welcome back.  Where do they put him?  PLJ in New York?  Whatever.  I say bring it on.  There have been so many of these dumb Howard stories since he went to Satellite.  And every one has been false.  None of them have come true.  So if this one's true, we say bring it on.  But his past track record does not lead me to believe that this is true either.  Everything else has just been bull crap.  What I love about the article in the New York Post, though, Howard's return to free air rumored.  Howard Stern may be coming back to Earth on PLJ or ABC. 
[00:51:30]  Radio insiders are reporting rampant rumors that the shock jock will do and Opie and Anthony.  Well, we did this first.  And we did satellite radio first as well, you ass.  Satellite first and then terrestrial.  Somehow he'll try to spin it that it was his idea first.  And please, go ahead.  All right, let's go to Allison in Pittsburgh.  Allison, what's up?  Hi.  Allison.  It was all for Allison. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, it was.  I just want to tell you I like your show and I said commercial.  That's all I want to tell you.  I liked it a lot.  That's it.  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry.  Did you chuckle?  Did you chuckle?  We should be number one in Pittsburgh in no time with phone calls like this.  Yes.  This is why people are tuning in to hear Opie and Anthony.  I'm sorry.  That's all I had.  I like your show and it makes me laugh.  Allison, what do you like about the commercial, though?  Give us a little something else.  I didn't know.  Attaboy.  Oh, no. 
[00:52:30]  Allison, she's just.  Adam in Florida, what's up?  Congratulations, Opie, on the New York Mets.  Thank you, sir.  I'm down here in Florida and I watched the game last night and there was wow stickers  all over all the signs calling around Shea Stadium, which is great to see.  You guys are making a presence and rock on.  Yeah, the virus is slowly but surely spreading.  There were wow stickers during the Mets game.  What part of Florida?  He's gone.  I don't know.  He was in Shea.  He wasn't in Florida.  See, that was just a quick call to congratulate me on the Mets, you know, clenching last night. 
[00:53:00]  Thank you.  Meet the Mets.  Because I had a lot to do with it.  I know.  I love how they congratulate the fans.  Hey, man.  You got to call your buddy up.  Hey, congrats, man.  You guys did it.  We all do that, though.  Yeah, we did.  We did.  We.  We all do that, though.  Our buddy Joey from Pisano.  Yeah.  Of Mulberry Street.  Hey.  The heart of Little Italy.  Our old pal.  He's an Eagles fan.  And one year when the Eagles were doing great, you know, we all had to call him up.  Congratulations, Joey.  Hey, best. 
[00:53:30]  I'll tell you why we do that.  Because when the Eagles lose, he's the first one you're going to call and yell, faggot.  So you figure you've got to give the guy some kind of good feelings when the team, it's  not his fault they lose, either.  So you've got to kind of give him some kind of nice, I was going to say props, but I looked  down and my skin color realized I shouldn't.  Joey is a true New Yorker.  Why is he a Dirty Eagles fan?  I don't like that.  Something went askew, man.  Because I believe he's a Yankee fan.  Holy crap.  I almost said Mets. 
[00:54:00]  I bet Joey was molested by somebody wearing a Giants helmet when he was a younger fella.  Something went wrong.  He had to become a Giants fan.  Something went wrong because he's as New Yorker as it comes and he loves the Islanders, you  know, he loves the Yankees.  That's what happened.  And then out of nowhere, he loves the Eagles.  It's like, what?  Young Joey.  How did that happen?  He was trick-or-treating one year, younger lad, and a man opened and was wearing a Giants  helmet for Halloween and gave young Joseph the business.  He put young Joseph's face in the candy and gave him the business, and young Joseph is 
[00:54:30]  now an Eagles fan.  That's my theory.  And can't eat candy corn.  If I don't show up for work for six weeks, you'll know Joseph disagreed.  It's so stupid how you pick your teams, though.  When I was really young, I've always been a Mets fan, but my dad went on a business trip  to Minnesota and brought back a Minnesota Twins banner.  Next thing you know, I'm a Minnesota Twins fan for a season and a half.  Are you?  Yeah.  I don't know where I'm like, well, I think I like this team now because I got their stupid  banner.  I don't know. 
[00:55:00]  I'm sure there's a million of those stories out there.  I forgot what it was with Joey and the Eagles.  Maybe he could call up if he's listening this morning.  It was some, I don't know, someone gave him a jersey when he was four, and it's just stock  or something.  You know how I became a Cowboy fan?  I think it was during the Pittsburgh-Dallas Super Bowl, Super Bowl XIII, which Jackie  Smith eventually did drop the pass and they lost.  I think that my whole family hated Dallas and everybody was rooting against them.  I think I rooted for them.  You wanted to be different.  Yeah.  I mean, I think that's probably what it was.  I mean, that's my earliest memory. 
[00:55:30]  It was like them losing the Super Bowl.  Hey, really fast.  Speaking of football, the football picks are sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  There you go, fan.  That plug's out of the way.  Holy crap.  But basically, the behind-the-scenes staff is picking games every week.  We got $10,000 up for grabs.  Ten large.  One of the guys is walking away with $10,000.  I'm in it just as a goof factor, and if I do win the $10,000, I'm going to throw it 
[00:56:00]  out a window or out of a helicopter to the fans.  I'm going to do something crazy with the $10,000.  Now, last week, I tried to pick the games, legit.  I went two for five.  Well, that's not that good.  It's not that good.  Two for five.  Probably could have done that, just flipping a coin.  Of course you could.  Well, the funny thing is, Sam and Steve, they don't know anything about football, and they're  in the lead.  You know what we should have done?  They've picked six right.  I got four right at this point.  You should have gotten a retarded person to make the picks. 
[00:56:30]  Like a genuine retarded person.  Yeah.  I have to do this every week.  Let's do it.  Find one.  Well, that shouldn't be hard.  Let's just go down and see who's listening to this program.  You're right.  There's a fourth one.  Bring me a waterhead.  I need a waterhead.  Can someone camp out on the sidewalk?  We got to find a retarded person.  And as soon as we find a waterhead, they just haven't picked my games for this week.  You can go all day without seeing one.  I'll go waterhead or bobblehead.  Or you can have that.  Your pick.  You can pick them and see who does well, better at the end of X amount of weeks. 
[00:57:00]  You or the guy, which will show you this randomness work.  Well, I'm that guy.  Well, you're not a retard, though.  I mean, you know football.  No, but I tried last week.  But now for the rest of this competition, I want to like – I love your idea.  I want to get a waterhead or a bobblehead to pick my games this week.  A bobblehead.  Damn.  And you can't just find them.  Like walking down the street.  Think about it.  You go days.  Without seeing them. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  I'll go with the midget.  I see them all the time.  Midgets are even more rare.  The midget will pick.  You got to go somewhere.  You know they hang out.  Huh?  The zoo.  I think they like the zoo.  Go like to the Bronx Zoo.  Find a whole group.  If you want to find retard – I don't know where to find retarded people other than the  porn I enjoy.  That's the only place.  Nothing?  No.  All right.  Go ahead, please.  All right.  Let's say hi to Eric in New York.  Hello.  I like Jimmy's idea, though.  I want a waterhead or a bobblehead to pick my football games this week. 
[00:58:00]  Hopi.  Yeah.  What's up, Eric?  Yeah.  I wanted to call you out on something.  I mean, you plan to be a big baseball fan, but just to know that it's not called a banner.  It's called a pennant.  All right.  Thank you, sir, for correcting me.  I really appreciate it.  It makes me feel real good about myself.  Very important.  Let's go to Josh in Pennsylvania.  Josh.  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I was on YouTube yesterday, and I was watching, just looking for some stuff, and I saw actually  when Opie threw the chips at that woman yesterday. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  That was some funny shit on the radio, but it was even funnier watching, actually, her  facial expression.  She took it like a champ, but you should have hit her in the face with those cards.  Well, she started crying later.  She kept up a brave face in the studio, but the second she left the studio, she was bawling,  just crying her eyes out by the elevator.  And, of course, we had Iraq run after her with a telephone to get every tear on the  air.  They replayed that clip on XM yesterday, by the way. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, and the clip on YouTube is pretty damn funny, I got to tell you.  I saw that recently as well.  A lot of great clips on YouTube.  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  All right.  Thank you, Josh.  No problem.  Hey, are you watching the house?  No, I don't like watching house.  I'm a little bit of a hypochondriac, and I can't watch those shows.  Some of them, some medical shows I could watch.  I liked watching emergency.  Remember that? 
[00:59:30]  Engine 51, squad 51.  And they'd pull out, because that was based on, like, accidents and stuff.  They'd go to a construction site, and the guy would be, like, pinned under some  wreckage, and they'd have to, you know, rampart, rampart.  What do we do on that big phone?  And then it was, like, accidents.  I don't like the medical stuff where people got something.  And house is the worst of them all, because they get things that no one gets. 
[01:00:00]  Like, regular, you know, ER.  ER is bad enough.  Dude, you ruined ER for me.  I was watching it as a dumb, stupid little show to pass the time before I went to Betty  Bye.  No, can't.  And then we had a discussion on the show one day where you say you can't watch these  shows because they talk about illnesses that you never thought about, and now you have  to think about, that you could get this dumb thing, even though you're living a perfect  life, and you're completely healthy.  Two reasons.  All of a sudden you start with a dumb little eye twitch that we all get, and next thing  you know, it's foot cancer.  It's like, what?  How did that happen?  You start with an eye twitch, and then you're like, I'm the luckiest man in the world. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, yeah, it started with an eye twitch.  Great.  It's either that.  I never looked into these shows that deeply until we discussed this on the air.  Now I can't watch Grey's Anatomy or ER.  Oh, none of that.  Or House.  None of them.  And I don't need the goddamn depression.  Like, I like being a happy feller.  I don't like watching a show where, all right, go in, tell the parents their little baby 
[01:01:00]  daughter's dead.  Oh, that's a wonderful scene.  It's just every scene, they're going for a goddamn Emmy.  Every scene.  All right.  Walk out, Noah Wiley.  He was on that show, right?  Yeah.  Walk out, and now go explain to the parents how this cute little girl that's laying here  on the gurney that you can see now with the tubes and everything is dead.  Tell them she's dead.  To be relevant, you might as well have used George Clooney. 
[01:01:30]  George Clooney.  See?  I don't know.  The reruns to me.  Is that show even still on?  Is it?  I think it's season 20.  Ooh, I'm on TV.  Cool.  I can't watch medical shows ever since I was a kid.  That goddamn medical center and Marcus Welby growing up.  So I can't watch them.  And House now is the worst.  Because they're diseases that start out like nothing. 
[01:02:00]  Every week.  It's nothing.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  I just came in.  I don't know.  It's a little elbow pain.  I've been playing some tennis.  I think it's tennis elbow.  Oh, let me take a look at that.  House comes and gimps over and looks at it.  And as he's looking at it, blood squirts out of the guy's eyeballs.  Feces comes out of his ears.  And his head spins around eight times.  And they got to admit him with something House has never seen before.  On an all-new House. 
[01:02:30]  What?  House is going to something.  They got to do something that could jeopardize his career.  Oh, again?  Still, what's he going to do?  This bit is too easy.  Here's this week's promo.  Don't miss the new Fox Tuesday.  First at eight.  House meets his match when a brilliant doctor wants to end his own suffering.  If I don't find out what's wrong with you, I'll help you die.  An all-new House.  If I don't find out what's wrong with you, I'll help you what? 
[01:03:00]  Die?  Is that it?  Yeah.  It's very controversial.  House.  Right.  Every week.  So if he can't cure you, he'll make sure you die nicely.  House.  Encountering something he's never seen before.  Again.  Quincy script.  House.  Thanks.  House is awful.  And everyone says it's a great show.  I will not watch it to even see if it's great.  Shows like CSI, I'll watch cop shows.  I like things like that.  CSI, murder, things like that. 
[01:03:30]  Fine with me.  I'll watch every one of those stupid Discovery Channel A&E.  It started on a cold December evening.  She was walking out to the mailbox and disappeared.  And then the first thing I do is I turn around and go,  Husband did it.  The husband did it.  And I'm so happy when the husband did it.  Bill Curtis, his voice.  Bill Curtis.  It's just all about disaster.  Whenever he mentions your name, you're finished.  Done.  Her body was found in the gutter.  I love it.  There is something so captivating about those just gruesome murders. 
[01:04:00]  And if you throw in like a sexual thing to it,  there's something that you can't tune away.  It's so horrific.  Best voice ever for that stuff is the woman who does the HBO voiceover for autopsy.  Autopsy.  That woman's announcement.  She's so good.  I don't know if I love her or if she just gives me the complete creeps.  Yeah.  She is good.  But I like Bill Curtis better. 
[01:04:30]  It's so like, you know, in the woods, they found bullet casing.  Did they?  I'm so interested.  Oh, Bill, what's happened?  What happened, Bill?  Tell me more.  And then they go to commercial.  They tease murders.  It's like a murder.  And it's like, the evidence would be found years later.  But would the DNA match?  We'll be right back.  I got it.  Does the DNA match?  I'm not going anywhere, Bill.  What channel has most of those now? 
[01:05:00]  What used to be?  Didn't the discovery used to be great?  Now it's all reality shows.  A&E really has a lot of that at night.  MSNBC also at night throws on a lot of the crime shows and prison shows.  They're known for their prison shows.  The prison things.  I can't get enough of those.  They do specials on like, you know, Oklahoma State Prison.  Bitches in prison.  Yeah.  Women's prison.  All dyked out and stuff.  And they go in.  Make it out on the picnic table during lunch recess or whatever they call it in prison.  Favorite scenes when they got to get the unit in because the guy is throwing feces out. 
[01:05:30]  The cops and put his mattress against the door and lit it on fire and stuff.  And they get all the guys in these big suits of what amounts to Kevlar armor.  And they have the shields that have the stun gun in it.  It's like a plexiglass shield that has metal strips on the front of it.  And it's a stun shield.  So all you got to do is hit him with the shield and he's down.  And they're all, you know, badass right up until it hits him. 
[01:06:00]  And then, all right, all right.  They drag him out.  But the scary thing is those convicts that they're going in to get, those are like, when you go to jail, those are the guys you have to fight.  Like a guy that takes six men in, like, football uniforms.  Yeah.  To tackle when he's angry.  Yeah.  And they still put up a fight.  That's the guy that will punch you in the face if you cut him on the food line.  You're done.  People like me, you.  No, not me.  You.  You.  Not me.  Done.  You.  I know how to handle myself.  Do you think walking in every prison movie shows the get off the bus and the walk-in holding your prison clothes and they're all, like, taunting you and spitting at you? 
[01:06:30]  I would just have to maybe right there disrobe and back up to a cell.  Just get it over with immediately.  All right.  Go ahead.  Do as you will with me.  Damn, man.  It's easy.  Do it, you will.  Very easy.  I would be the prison whore.  See, now, a guy like, we got Chuck Liddell coming in. 
[01:07:00]  That's a guy who's obviously never going to be sexually assaulted.  But the problem he would have is he'd have to fight all the time because everyone would want to say they knocked out Chuck Liddell.  You've got to be the tough guy.  Everyone would want a shot at him just even if they got their asses kicked.  It's happened before.  That's another thing.  So they all want to say they're the guy that knocked out.  Yeah, we've got to ask him about that, too, because when Mike Tyson was in his prime, a lot of people wanted to fight Mike Tyson when they saw him on the street.  That's why he had bodyguards and stuff to take care of that philosophy.  To have the bragging rights to fight him in a street fight.  Every prison movie, they also have that scene where, you know, you got to take on the biggest guy in order to show everybody that you're, you know, badass and crazy. 
[01:07:30]  And that would never work in reality.  You would be in the cafeteria.  You see the biggest guy.  You say something to him.  And then you whack him or something.  You hit him.  And nothing would happen.  He would pummel you.  You would later get pummeled again.  You would probably get raped.  Then beat for the rest of your time in there by the biggest guy in prison.  That's how it really plays out.  Yeah, because they don't. 
[01:08:00]  The people think if you just hit the biggest guy, you'll get respect.  But what do you think the biggest guy is going to do, punch you once?  He may decide to cut your air off with his food tray and murder you.  And just kill you right there.  You just punch the biggest guy in jail in the face.  What do you think he's going to do?  I respect you, little fella.  He's going to kill you.  That only works when you're the maybe by a small margin the second biggest guy in prison and have kind of a chance.  Or if you have a reason to hit him.  If he did something, if he took something from you and then you saw him and hit him.  What are you going to do? 
[01:08:30]  Let's say he took your breathe right strip, Jimmy.  What are you going to do?  I'd say I'd prefer if you gave that back because it helps me cut down in my snoring, young man.  They're all in the same boat and that's why we try to stay out of trouble.  What would I do?  Ideally, I would hit him and take my beating because you have to.  Otherwise, you're asking for even worse problems.  And in reality, what would I do?  Leave him alone.  What would I do?  I'd stand up and go, if you don't give that back, I'll report you to the authorities. 
[01:09:00]  My friend is a guard here.  I hear that would work.  Yeah, sure.  There are movie prison things and real prison things.  And there's reality.  And forget about it.  Now we've got all the guys calling up that work in jails.  We've done this.  We'll take one real fast.  Frank in New York, what's up?  Hi, how's everything?  First, you were talking about the cell with the officers that go on in the suits.  I work for New York State and that's the surf team. 
[01:09:30]  I was on that for six years.  The surf team, yeah.  I was the fourth man in.  I had the left arm once he got pinned up.  Right.  Yeah, you know, we get called, ain't no joke.  You know, you're going to the infirmary.  Oh, wait, you guys each basically pick a body part.  You're assigned a body part?  That's a smart, smart idea.  Well, they know exactly what they're going after when they go in there.  Now, you said that you're going to the infirmary if you guys are coming in.  What do you do if the conduct all of a sudden realizes, all right, I'm about to get my teeth 
[01:10:00]  knocked out.  And you guys break in.  He just lays on the floor, arms out.  Listen, when an inmate gives up, it's over.  Okay.  You can't do anything because everything's being filmed.  Yeah, they also have a video guy that comes in right after that as they're going in.  Smart.  He's like the last guy in, but he's got an overhead view and he's looking down on the  whole scene for everyone's protection.  Yeah.  The first guy's job is to pin him.  If he keeps going, everybody gets a body part. 
[01:10:30]  The fifth man in, the sixth man in has the shackles and the cuffs.  The seventh man has the camera.  Usually a supervisor.  How do you decide who's going in first?  Who gets that awful detail?  It's what you practice.  You have the training.  Everybody gets the training.  It's, you know, who wants the job?  And we practice.  We used to practice as being the inmate taking on the officers.  Who's the lucky fellow that gets the private parts when you're going in there? 
[01:11:00]  You know, that's usually the house pitch, but no one on the cert team goes after that.  Are there guys that you've gone in on that really did make all five of you really, like,  work?  I mean, like, guys that were a problem for even all of you guys together?  Usually the problem guys are the smaller inmates that sit around, that don't have a  program, that have nothing to do all day but be pissed.  And, you know, a lot of people find it hard to believe, but the bigger guys that work out  all the time, have programs, whatever it is, the mess hall, DMV. 
[01:11:30]  A lot of people don't know.  You talk to DMV, you're talking to an inmate.  You ain't talking to someone, you know, out of the regular DMV office.  That's a surprise.  You know, so, but it's the guys that work out that you don't have the problem with  because they're working out their frustrations.  They got a job.  You know, it's these little guys that, you know, 110 pounds wet holding two cinder blocks.  They give you the hardest problem because they pissed off that they got to be in there. 
[01:12:00]  They got nothing to do all day.  But what if you said to the guy, sir, please don't do that.  We'd prefer it if you didn't.  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you.  What would happen if you used logic?  If you said to the person, sir, please don't do that.  30 seconds of nothingness.  Well, you know, what are you going to do?  What would happen if there was a bigger man than you and he punched you for your jello and you told somebody?  Listen, you got a right.  Are you allowed to talk while you're in line in prison?  I've heard so many rumors.  You do what you got to do.  I would be very scared going there, sir. 
[01:12:30]  How would I get out of library detail?  Sir, did you see a state from Alcatraz?  Was that more realistic than the Morgan Freeman movie with Tim Robbins?  Yep.  How often would you say people get shagged?  I would be very scared to be in jail.  That's why I'm a good citizen.  Sir, do you think that people fight in jail because they're angry or because they're sad? 
[01:13:00]  Sir, when you're after, you're done eating your lunch, are you allowed to bring a donut back to your cell?  You can bring a goat anything you want.  But how is the coffee in jail?

This was a company. 
[01:15:30]  This was a cute little story.  I love this guy.  Anthony thought he was a douche.  Who's that?  I'll play it for you again.  All right.  Let me hear it.  We talked about this about two and a half hours ago in the office.  A Long Island neighborhood cleaning up this morning after a man goes on a rampage in a bulldozer, of all things.  The man was reportedly very upset that Lipa had cut power to his home.  So what did he do?  Cops say that's when he went on a joyride, taking out power poles and trees and quorum. 
[01:16:00]  He later arrested the suspect sitting on a curb.  Lipa not reporting any power outages.  That guy just lucky he wasn't electrocuted, for gosh sakes, you know?  Oh.  I love the guy.  For gosh sakes.  No, this guy's an ass.  I love the guy.  I love this guy.  If it had been, let's say, Lipa didn't turn his power on because there was an outage and he'd been waiting and waiting and waiting,  then he'd be some kind of a, you know, hero mowing down there, stuff saying, fix my crap. 
[01:16:30]  But it seems to me, from the story, I don't know all the details, that he's a guy that probably didn't pay his bill and they turned his power off.  They just said, you know, Lipa turned his power off.  He's having a tough time making ends meet.  Yeah.  Probably need a little more time.  Called him up and said, I need a little time.  They said, screw you.  You're just a little person.  So his neighbors.  Little people, we don't deal with you guys.  You either pay or we shut you off. 
[01:17:00]  His neighbors may have had to suffer by having no power because he's mowing down telephone poles.  Knocking on mailboxes.  Driving through people's backyards.  Got a girl on a bulldozer.  Took a cross-state line.  That's a man act.  You gotta love him, though.  He gets in his bulldozer.  Just starts knocking down the poles in his neighborhood.  Just get a bulldozer, too.  Especially on Long Island.  Just gets a bulldozer.  There's not a lot of bulldozers on Long Island.  That guy's that do that.  Or grab tanks. 
[01:17:30]  It's like he was driving a tank down the highway.  That's one of the greatest videos ever.  Gotta give him credit for that.  That guy was a psychopath, but...  Oh, yeah, when he ran over the motorhome and just cut right through it.  And then the cars and...  Where did he get the tank again?  He was in the military or something?  Yeah, I think it was San Diego.  And what, a little domestic dispute or something?  Yeah, he was a little angry.  He decided to take the tank through some neighborhoods.  And then on the freeway.  Just rolling over the top of people's cars.  Some of the best stuff is the police audio from that. 
[01:18:00]  He actually didn't know, miraculously, because he was crushing everything in his way.  And the cop audio from the radio is great, because they're going, how do we stop this?  They're asking supervisors, and no one has an answer.  No one had an answer, how to stop it, because he's rolling over cars like they're nothing.  Cutting right through them.  How crazy.  And finally, it was his own mistake.  He tried to make a U-turn from one side of the freeway to the other, and got hung up on the cement barrier in the middle. 
[01:18:30]  And the cops rushed him and opened up the lid.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Shot him dead right in there.  In his little tank.  How did that not break through the barrier?  I don't know.  He got hung up on it.  The way he hit it, he hit it kind of sideways.  And yeah, it was teeter-totter.  He wasn't trying to knock it down.  He was trying to go over the top.  Trying to go over the top.  And he miscalculated.  And then, like Ann said, he was stuck, and he couldn't move forward anymore.  Yeah, on either side of the barrier.  And he was kind of just sitting there.  Yeah.  It's one of the greatest videos ever. 
[01:19:00]  Mark.  That's on every one of those police chase videotape things.  I've seen it a million times.  Mark in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, man.  I used to work for PSE&G.  It's an electric company here in Jersey.  Yeah.  And I took the calls when people have their power shut off.  It's really hard to get your power turned off.  And once it's off, basically, if you tell us you'll give us a dollar a month extra, we'll turn you right back on.  This guy had to be a real douche to have his power shut off so long, and he got this pissed off.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I guess there's more to the story, so hopefully we'll find out. 
[01:19:30]  We used to get our power turned off in California all the time.  My father wasn't big on paying bills.  Not big on paying bills.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  Another father story coming.  So for a little while, we had kerosene lanterns in our condo.  We rented this place.  And even as a kid, when we're signing the lease, I saw this little old couple that owned this brand new condominium.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, like, she had these twisted arthritic fingers. 
[01:20:00]  And she's writing her name on the lease.  And it's all big and fun.  And my father's got the, you know, charming smile on.  And as he's signing it, even as a kid, I'm going, oh, this ain't going to last long.  This ain't going to last long.  I knew my father was just really irresponsible as far as cash went and stuff.  What was he spending the money on instead of electricity?  Well, first, you'd have to make the money, which entailed, like, holding a job.  And that was kind of rough for him. 
[01:20:30]  Never really held down a good job for very long.  But he had a great time, didn't he?  He got, oh, great time.  Great time.  He got a job once as a, he was like, he was an investigator by trade.  That's what he did.  But I don't know what he ever investigated.  They'd give him these surveillance vehicles with the, like, one-way mirror glass on the camper shells in the back and stuff.  And I don't know what the hell he did.  Never went to work.  He'd hang out with the Mexicans at the stable and just drink beer. 
[01:21:00]  And, oh, yeah, our electricity is getting shut off, things like that.  So, finally, we were getting tired of the gas lamps because you can't really watch a gas lamp and be entertained by it.  We wanted television.  So, he went outside and took the meter off and completed the circuit with a piece of wire and then put the meter back on.  It's called jumping the meter, I guess.  And that worked for quite a while, a long time. 
[01:21:30]  That worked for, like, a year.  They never came and checked or anything.  They just assumed we weren't paying the bill and they never checked anything.  So, we went a year without paying any electric bill and getting electricity.  Did he finally get caught?  We were gone by then.  We were out of that place.  We didn't last long in there.  And that beautiful condo had, like, little house on the prairie oil lamp burn marks on the ceiling. 
[01:22:00]  And the dogs would be in the house and sometimes they'd get into things that would make them go to the bathroom in certain ways that are very hard to clean up.  And that was in the carpeting, trying to pick it up.  And it was just like, you know, that's not all coming out.  Just destroyed the place.  Yeah.  And the dog would be left in the apartment sometimes.  And the wall, the corners of every wall were chewed through the sheetrock. 
[01:22:30]  Just like, oh, that poor old couple.  What are you going to do?  Bill from Waterford.  Oh, so that's why you were taking showers with your dad.  It wasn't to teach you how to bathe.  It was to conserve water if it was shut off the next day.  Right.  Never knew how long we were going to have hot water.  Pat the Trucker, what's up?  What's happening, fellas?  Hey.  Can I support this guy after the bill I just got from LIPA?  Oh?  Yeah, I live out in Suffolk County.  I have a one-bedroom apartment.  My bill for the last month was $6.50.  Wow. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, what are you doing?  You're refrigerating like a meat locker with your air conditioner?  No.  I have central air conditioning.  I know the unit's a piece of junk and it's not working, but still, for one month, they  tell me 3,000 kilowatt hours used, $6.50.  I call them up and they say, eh, too bad.  Screw the electric bills.  How about the cable bills?  Are they out of hand or what?  Hey, let's hear it, people.  Let's hear it, huh?  How much are you paying for cable?  I pay about $200.  I'm up to $200. 
[01:23:30]  $200 a month for cable.  All right, Pat.  The cable.  Thank you, Pat.  Patrice in Texas, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was just calling to say that I'm really glad you guys are back on the radio.  I was pissed back when they took me off in Philly.  Complimentary call.  In Philly?  Yeah.  I'm from Philadelphia.  Yeah?  And I moved to Fort Worth and I was, yeah.  Was it worth it?  Sorry.  Well, you know, it's a four to four. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, it is.  It's a good thing.  Boring.  And I hated Jimmy.  I love the show, by the way.  Boring.  Boring.  So, you're not a Jimmy fan.  Of course you're boring.  You sound like Daffy Duck.  Is that the best you have?  You sound like Daffy Duck.  You stupid Philly whore who moved to Texas to be a whore down there.  Is that the best you have?  Yeah.  I'm a whore wrangler.  Exactly.  Who cares if you like me? 
[01:24:30]  Just die.  Lucky Louie, the show, and you guys are great.  I'm really glad you're back on radio.  Oh, you like Lucky Louie?  Oh.  Oh, my fault.  No, she's a good girl.  I'm a former Howard fan.  Oh, are you?  Well, we're glad you're here because you're obviously bringing a lot.  All right.  Thank you.  God bless.  Keep listening.  All right.  All right.  All right, guys.  Goodbye.  Let's go to Jay in Philly.  Jay, what's up?  You should never listen again.  You guys, so you're not black?  Your aunt's father don't want to keep a job. 
[01:25:00]  Hope's growing up, not having enough milk and food.  What the hell's going on?  Yeah.  We were kind of brought up poor.  A little poor, but no, it wasn't so much poor as just...  Actually, we weren't...  Priorities were really, really bad.  We weren't poor.  We had seven kids, and then they were bringing in other kids to be the good Christians that  the church was trying to turn my family into, and it didn't work.  Hope's family was like a cult, and my father wanted to be a cowboy until he died. 
[01:25:30]  But one summer, we had a black kid, like this black chick.  I wonder what ever happened to her.  Ooh.  How old is that?  Chocolate.  She would come out and spend the weekends with the church, but we were responsible for  her.  Uh-oh.  But she didn't have to live with us, but we had to do things with her.  Hope she was a hooker.  I hate to...  It was the weirdest arrangement.  Let you in on this, but...  All of a sudden, we're at the beach.  We're all putting suntan lotion on and stuff, and she's just sitting there, no lotion needed.  Just like...  It was so foreign to us. 
[01:26:00]  I'm not going to lie to you.  Black people in Centerport, yeah.  Yeah, there weren't many black people in Centerport.  I was introduced to the shwoogie when I went to junior high school.  Oh.  I don't think they...  Did they call them that?  In your neck of the woods?  God, man.  The church is the strangest thing ever.  You know, we're having a tough time making ends meet, and then they convince you to take  more kids in.  Help others.  How about we help our own first?  No, guys.  All right.  All right, man.  Jay, that's what I was going to say to that.  And I know I wasn't black back then. 
[01:26:30]  I really want to know what happened to that black girl.  For a summer, she was like part of our family.  Kind of.  I don't know.  Yeah, callers are lame today.  You're right, Maurice.  Don't have to go to that.  You want to try to sneak one more in before we take a break?  What have we got?  Chuck Lydell is here.  We're going to talk to him next.  Yeah.  But another teacher in trouble.  Another teacher in trouble.  Let me guess.  Here's the story.  At Smyrna High, the boys' soccer coach and history teacher has been suspended without  pay. 
[01:27:00]  Charles Hardy is accused of kissing two female students.  Teresa Bush is live there with that story.  Ah.  Again, they're sending the reporter that fits the story.  Another one.  Teresa?  Demetria Hardy has denied these allegations.  He was a second-year teacher and coach here at Smyrna High School.  He'd previously worked at Putnam County and in Warren County.  And he had a clear record when Rutherford County school officials did a background check on him. 
[01:27:30]  But now he is facing allegations that could cost him his job.  Two female students at Smyrna High School claim teacher and soccer coach Charles E. Hardy  kissed them.  They say it happened in front of other students in his classroom.  Well, there's a difference when you have a kindergartner who has scraped their elbow and  there's a teacher trying to comfort that.  And when you're dealing with high school girls who are nearly 18 and a student or a teacher  kissing on the head, on the cheek, in front of the class, it's just completely inappropriate. 
[01:28:00]  I think it's gross if you kiss on a kid's scraped-up elbow.  Oh, I know.  I'll make this better.  Yuck.  Kid scrapes his elbow.  Next thing you know, there's a tongue down his throat now.  Does it make you feel better?  This will work.  This guy is just all horned up, man.  What a creep.  Oh, my God.  Scrapes his elbow.  Fast forward 20 years.  He can't keep a rod.  And he's crying in bed while his wife goes, what's the matter, honey?  And he just bites the pillow.  I scraped my elbow.  He kissed it. 
[01:28:30]  I don't give it your breath.  The guy's just fishing.  Get a Band-Aid.  He's just fishing.  A few kisses to the forehead.  He's trying to figure out who the goers are.  Is that what it was?  Yeah, who the goers are and who could keep a secret.  It starts slow.  Oh, yeah.  A little kiss on the cheek, on the forehead.  That's what this guy's up to.  He's just throwing his line to the water.  Seeing what happens.  Teachers are creeps.  Evans says all teachers in Rutherford County had training before school started this year  on what actions are acceptable and unacceptable when it comes to students. 
[01:29:00]  There's a line that you cross there.  You know, encouragement, we encourage encouragement.  But physical touching between teachers and students, especially with something like this,  completely off limits.  One of the teenagers says Hardy kissed her twice this month on the cheek and on the head.  And after she spoke out, another 17-year-old girl came forward and told teachers he'd kissed  her on the cheek last spring.  It's one of those unfortunate things that you think that someone would have enough common  sense not to do something like that. 
[01:29:30]  But unfortunately, that's not the case.  School leaders here in Rutherford County have asked the Sheriff's Department to investigate  to see if there are any criminal charges.  Now, you may think what's a kiss got to do with criminal charges.  Well, under these circumstances, a teacher and a student, it could be viewed as sexual  assault or battery by an authority figure.  No charges have been filed yet.  That investigation is still going on.  We went to Hardy's home here in Smyrna today.  He declined to make a comment on air, but he has told authorities here that he is innocent 
[01:30:00]  of these allegations.  Now, as far as Hardy's future here at Smyrna High School, well, that's in the hands of the  school's director who says he will not make a decision until the Sheriff's Department  investigation is over.  What do you think's going on there?  You think he's just a good teacher?  He's doing it in front of everybody?  He's trying.  Or is that his cover, you think?  Like, what's going on?  I want to hear what he did when the kid reported that she had hemorrhoids.  How he took care of that?  I don't know.  It's hard to tell.  Is there a lot of paranoia going on in the schools? 
[01:30:30]  Maybe.  And students are looking out for all their behavior.  Yeah, I think they're, yeah.  So they're confusing maybe an innocent kiss to the forehead as something different?  They're being overly cautious.  But then again, the kids aren't that young.  They're...  No, they're 17.  17, 18?  Yeah.  Hell, he knows.  Enough with his affection.  There's a line between teacher and student that shouldn't be crossed.  And it's that whole, you know, kissing thing.  Doesn't fit in there.  Not supposed to.  I was just being friendly. 
[01:31:00]  The boy had a groin...  Groin...  A groin injury.  A groin injury.  The boy had a groin injury.  The boy had a groin injury.  I should have my fat face slapped.  I wish I could have done that.  Yeah.  All right.  Back in...  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to 1976, Anthony.  1976, Anthony.  What's up?  Hi.  Good morning, guys.  Listen, 2006, Anthony.  I wonder if you could send us some of that Cobra Shelby money.  You know, we have no power today.  Go screw 1976, Anthony. 
[01:31:30]  You work it out yourself.  If I changed that, if I gave you money, it might screw things up and I would disappear  from right now.  That's right.  Because you would do things differently.  You know, you'd screw up the whole space-time continuum.  He spent your money on a Mustang.  That's it.  Then this is 1976, Jimmy, here.  All right.  That is why this is proof positive that a time machine will never, ever be invented. 
[01:32:00]  Because if it will have been invented at some point, we would know about it because somebody  would come back and say it.  It actually will be invented.  It cannot.  It would never.  Yeah, it can be.  Because somebody would have come back to fix something.  No, maybe we really haven't invented it yet.  Maybe we have not invented it yet.  But if you eventually do, then you'd come back.  No, you wouldn't.  You'd come back in time and...  Oh, no.  We're heading into pot talk.  It may not work that way. 
[01:32:30]  It would have to.  Oh, God.  All of a sudden, you'd be there.  Let's say 25 years from now, I invent a time machine.  I come back.  I vow I will come right back into this studio.  I will walk in right now.  See, I guess it didn't happen.  And I was looking at the door.  I was a believer.  I know.  Everyone was turning around.  I was a believer.  Someone would come back and say, hey, I'm from the future.  Maybe by then we know the rules and we can only observe a certain way or interact a certain way. 
[01:33:00]  Everyone breaks the rules.  Someone will come back just to help them out.  You get a loved one that died.  You want to tell them something like that.  It changes everything.  I come back and just commit sexual assaults and hop on my ship and head back to the future.  Head back home and see them all screwed up later in life.  See the damage you've done and giggle.  See you?  I'm not.  Sam!  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  Scott from Virginia.  Tell Opie to please stop mispronouncing Chuck's last name.  It's not Lidell.  It's Lidell. 
[01:33:30]  Sorry, Scott.  Call him a liar?  Better Scott tells you than Chuck.  Yeah, exactly.  I think that's why I read his feedback.  Just take care of that right now.  We're going to talk to Chuck Lidell next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Holy crap.

[01:34:30]  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  We have Chuck Liddell in studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  Good morning, Chuck.  How you doing, man?  Way too early, but how you doing?  Yeah.  It's too early for you?  It would be too early for me if I was in California at home. 
[01:35:00]  And it's way too early.  Oh, yeah.  It's way too early out here.  Chuck is an intimidating guy, and he just comes in.  He's nice.  But just because when you've seen a guy do nothing but punch other people in the face and knock  them down, you really don't want to misstep and say something stupid.  I'm like, do I say hello?  Do I say hi?  Which would he prefer?  Yeah, I know.  Very personable.  Very nice.  I try to be, but I have that switch.  I can turn it on and off.  Oh, you got the switch? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  You seem to fight different than a lot of the guys do.  I watch some of the UFC, and it seems like a lot of the guys do a lot more grappling and  stuff like that.  And it seems like you are just about knocking them out.  Well, that's what I'm good at.  I mean, I wrestled in high school and college, and I know the submission's pretty good, but  what's fun for me is knocking guys out.  I like to hit people.  You have taken a lot of different styles, and you're good with each one of them. 
[01:36:00]  A lot of people are just one-trick ponies, and that doesn't quite work anymore.  Oh, that doesn't work at all anymore.  No.  But the thing is, you got to be good and comfortable.  I'm comfortable on the ground.  I'm a decent wrestler, and so that allows me to do what I love, is punch people.  Yeah.  There was a fight.  God, I cannot remember your opponent's name, but it was a rematch of a guy that actually  defeated you.  Randy Couture or Jeremy Horn?  Horn.  It was the Horn fight.  They should have stopped that fight a little earlier. 
[01:36:30]  I watched that fight, and-  His corner should have stopped that fight in the first round.  Screw that.  I loved it.  Oh, my God.  Bloodthirsty.  He threw me after the first round.  I'd let that go for another three rounds.  What is your strategy where he's on his back?  You got an open face to punch at him, but you back off and let him get back up.  I wanted to knock him out.  It's easier to knock him out from my feet.  Is that it? 
[01:37:00]  You got, like-  Because I'm like, oh, Chuck is kicking his head.  That takes balls.  Oh, God.  You're going to knock him out from your feet, I think.  Yeah.  For me.  I mean, I'm finishing the fight for me, standing up.  I can end the fight any time.  One punch, one kick.  Yeah.  I've seen it.  It's devastating.  On the ground, it's a little harder to cause that much damage, punching a guy.  And are you not worried, but, well, maybe worried or concerned that because he's on the ground, he might be able to get you and trip you up, maybe get you in a hold. 
[01:37:30]  Well, you know, that's the other thing.  For a guy like Jeremy Horn, though, that's where he's comfortable.  He can actually rest a little bit down there if we're on top and spot a little bit.  Yeah.  He's not comfortable standing up with me, so he's not resting at all.  The pain factor.  Now, in the ring, I assume later on, you're probably like, man, that hurts.  But when you're in the ring, are you feeling pain?  Are you?  No, not at all.  You don't?  That's not something that bothers you.  I mean, I don't think. 
[01:38:00]  I mean, some of the guys, maybe.  I don't know.  But I've been striking since I was 12 years old, and I don't really think about it.  I'll worry about pain when I'm done.  I'm a pussy, Chuck.  I see you guys against the fence.  Do you think you needed to tell Chuck that?  No.  No.  Not at all.  Sorry, I don't mean to laugh really loud.  There's all kinds of punching going on.  I know.  I am a pussy, and didn't even have to say it.  Just in case Chuck was wondering.  Oh, boy.  Relax, Chuck.  I'm the one.  Yeah, relax.  Relax.  Relax.  I'm not going to.  There's one less guy you've got to worry about in the studio. 
[01:38:30]  But I see the guys up against the fence.  They're up against the fence, just getting in a hold or something.  And I sit there and go, ooh, that fence must hurt.  And meanwhile, his elbow's going into the nose.  You guys don't seem to be worried about size either.  Like, I mean, I watched a little Asian guy who was fighting from his back.  And there was a big, I think it was a big Russian standing over him and trying to punch  down while this guy just, like, pivoted on his back on the floor.  And eventually he got picked up.  And I'm like, oh, this little guy is finished. 
[01:39:00]  And 30 seconds later, the big guy is tapping because this little bastard put an arm bar on  him.  You guys just don't care how big your opponent is.  That was on Valley Tudo, a Japanese Valley Tudo one, right?  The guy almost had a shut eye.  Oh, I didn't remember.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  That was tough, man.  Yeah, he's a tough kid, man.  That's what the best thing about ultimate fighting is.  It's, you don't have to worry about size or, you know.  You've got to worry about size some.  No, I mean, yeah, somewhat, but it's not so much like.  A really good athlete that's got really good technique. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, if you've got a good technique.  Beat a guy that's not as good technically, so.  You're intimidated by bigger guys.  I mean, you're 6'2", what, 205?  205 is what I fight at, yeah.  How much, we were talking about jail and stuff before.  How much testing do guys do of you just because you're Chuck Liddell  and they're like, I would love to.  Honestly, I never get that.  I haven't got that in years, man.  We've got a guy on the phone that claims that he hit you in a bar in Vegas  just to see what would happen.  Dave in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey, Chuck, what's happening? 
[01:40:00]  How you doing?  All right.  I don't know if you remember when I hit you in a bar in Vegas  about three years ago.  Do you remember that?  My buddy's dared me to do it, and I just wanted to see what you would do.  You'd turn around and beat the shit out of me?  Well, they dumped out of that just so everyone else could enjoy.  He's saying you'd turn around and beat the crap out of me.  Yeah, sorry, sorry.  Honestly, I don't remember, so, you know, but.  Hey, love you, though, man. 
[01:40:30]  You're a great fighter.  Thank you very much.  What an idiot.  Yeah, how many shots did you have?  Yeah, why would you do that?  You see that pit bull over there?  How many shots did I have?  I don't remember.  How old were you when you knocked out your first guy?  Oh, I don't know.  Let's see.  Do I remember?  Probably 14 or 15.  Yeah, well.  And that was your first real fight?  Schoolyard, like Dan's saying?  No, I've been fighting in the school yard.  I was not a little kid, but that was when I started doing martial arts at 12,  and I started actually competing when I was about 14, 15. 
[01:41:00]  Now you realize you had a gift, because knocking people out the way you do, I mean, is a gift.  You just hit people, and they fall, and it just, what did you realize, like, wow, I really can do this?  One punch power, I think, is a gift at some point.  I mean, it's not the easiest thing to do.  It's also that you can see an opportunity so quickly.  Like, you can see an opening.  If somebody leaves you a split second of an opening to his face, it is over. 
[01:41:30]  Well, I think a lot of it is that.  I mean, timing and accuracy is more important than pure power.  Yeah.  At a lot of points.  What are you feeling when you're walking into the, like, when you're walking up?  Because this fight is always fascinating to me.  It's because you guys are going in there to, like, hurt somebody or be hurt.  What are you thinking as you're approaching the ring?  Like, what is your adrenaline?  Are you scared, or are you just blocked that?  Is it anger?  What is it?  I don't get it.  I get excited going in.  You get the adrenaline.  I actually love to fight.  I love to get out there.  I've worked for three months to get there. 
[01:42:00]  This is my reward.  I get to fight somebody.  Dude, that's the last guy you want to fight.  If he sees the fight, it's his reward.  Oh, that's the last guy you want to fight.  Do you see it?  Do you see it sometimes on an opponent's face?  Do you see fear because of who you are?  Hey, watch Tito next time I fight him.  That guy.  You can see that's fear.  When he's looking across the ring, that's fear.  Yeah?  He's guaranteed.  You know that he's scared of you.  He's been afraid of me for years.  Oh, yeah.  I knocked him out last time we fought.  There's a huge rivalry there, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  How long is it a fight?  He runs his mouth a lot, but he's still afraid of me.  Don't let him kid you.  Wow.  Tito didn't last long with you, did he?  How long?  Am I remembering incorrectly or is it a different fight?  No.  Watch your second round, 30-some odd seconds the next second round.  And you knock him out standing?  Yeah.  We have somebody in the room that actually took on Tito once.  Our own Steve C.  Yeah.  Took him on.  11 seconds.  Chuck won't even look at you.  He's so disgusted with the thought that you might have taken on him.  He won't even look at you.  Steve was a lot fatter. 
[01:43:00]  How much did you weigh back then?  Fat guy.  Four bills.  He was four bills, Chuck.  And Tito came in, so we thought, let's see how long it takes Tito to take poor Steve out.  Yeah.  11 seconds, he was on my back and put me in a sleeper hole that was almost unconscious.  And 10 of those seconds, he was wrapping up a phone call.  We're not going to do the same thing today, because I thank you.  And Steve, he kicks his ass.  I am really hoping you guys can imagine.  You've got to remember that.  Huh?  Yeah.  Punch it.  Yeah.  Yep. 
[01:43:30]  Because there are a lot of guys that wear a submission hole.  Oh, my God.  He's sizing up Steve.  Look.  Oh, great.  We're not doing it today.  Oh, one punch.  Chuck's like, I need a snack.  He has a Prius jaw.  Right.  No, we can do that.  You guys ever see that thing I did on Inked?  Huh?  Yeah.  Inked.  The show, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jason Ellis asked me to hit him on the shoulder.  You didn't see that?  I didn't see that.  Oh, no.  It was hilarious.  What kind of damage?  Well, you know, I was real nice about it.  I said, I'm not going to hit you, and I don't want to hit you, and the guy kept, 
[01:44:00]  so I tap him, and he goes, hey, is that all you got?  Oh, no.  Boom.  Oh, he hit the floor.  It was hilarious.  It was kind of funny.  I'm like, I've kind of felt bad on the way after, but I'm like-  What an idiot.  Why does anyone ask?  Why would anyone ask for that?  They have to prove something.  They have to prove, like, all right, Chuck hit me, and all I want to do is, all right,  how can I be nice to this person and walk away with my teeth? 
[01:44:30]  Why do you feel a need to challenge somebody who's job-  Yeah, I saw him about a year later at a fundraiser for Tony Hawk, and it was pretty funny.  Still got his bruise.  No, he was an emcee there, so he was making fun of me the whole day, giving me a hard time,  but he's actually a pretty nice guy.  So, man, I was drunk.  Why'd you listen to me?  Oh.  Your post-victory celebration in the ring, is that like a release valve?  Yeah, that's about the most-  I tell you what, I'm not very emotional normally, but that's about as excited as I've ever seen 
[01:45:00]  me again is when I knock somebody out of the ring.  Excited.  It is frightening.  When-  Because, I mean, they play it up.  The camera goes right on you, and you flex and make a face like, oh my God, this guy  is a monster.  You are a living monster.  That, like, it's the most frightening thing to see.  And then the poor son of a bitch, just laying there, has to look up at you.  That's got to suck.  Oh, God.  Smelling salt.  Did you see him yelling hip-hip hooray? 
[01:45:30]  In the corner, he feels, what happened?  What do guys, what do guys say to you afterwards?  Because a lot of times you see the opponents, you know, you guys come up, have some mutual  respect.  I say good fight, whatever, I don't know.  Anyone ever say, dude, man, I've never been hit like that, or, you know, give you a compliment  like-  Not right there, no.  You know, sometimes the next day.  Oh, yeah, they're not making much sense.  A lot of, I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't want to go to school today.  Are the Brazilians as scary as they used to be? 
[01:46:00]  I mean, they were the guys, it seemed like, everybody was afraid of, obviously the Gracies.  Are they not as frightening because of people who caught up to them?  Well, everybody knows what they're doing now.  Everyone does it, too.  I mean, look at Matt Hughes and Hoist.  Matt Hughes fought Hoist.  He beat him at his own game, and he was a step ahead of him the whole time.  I mean, it just-  People caught on to that relatively quickly.  It's still, it's the same, same style, but everybody's using their style now, too.  I mean, it's, it's become truly mixed martial arts.  You can't, it used to be, you know, boxing versus wrestling versus jiu-jitsu, whatever. 
[01:46:30]  But now it's, you know, everybody in it, it's just, they know all three.  They just have a, which one they like to concentrate on, their, which one's their favorite to use  against somebody.  It's been interesting watching it evolve like that, because at the beginning, you would  see a couple of these guys get in, and it was all about submission holds, and they'd  wrap up, it was like watching a couple of snakes, and one guy, you know, out of nowhere  would tap out, and you'd go, what happened?  Yeah.  You know, what the hell happened?  And they'd show it in slow motion and go, oh, he grabbed his arm and shoved it around 
[01:47:00]  by his ear, and you didn't even see it.  But now, you've got to know a little bit of everything, and I think your advantage, especially  the way it is right now, is just that something about punching someone hard in the face just  beats everything.  It just beats everything.  Always wins in the end.  That's why people like watching Chuck, because we don't understand.  I watch the announcers, or I listen to the announcers talk about what's going on, like  when they're in a hold, or he's looking out to lock the arm, and I have no idea, but 
[01:47:30]  when I see you standing up, and your fists are up, I know exactly what your goal is.  Hit him in the face as far as I can.  I watch that, and I can, like, you know, that's where I relate to it.  It makes life simple for me, too, you know?  Yeah.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  This is, wow, a lot of people that want to say hi today.  Joe in Jersey, what's up?  It's Chuck Liddell.  I'm on the ice, man.  How are you, bro?  I'm doing great, man.  I love the way you fight.  I love everything about you.  I just can't wait to see you spank Tito one more time in that ring, because I hate that  guy.  Hey, no problem.  That'd be my pleasure.  Is that going to happen?  What they're talking about doing in December, we'll see. 
[01:48:00]  He's fighting Ken in October on Spike, but hopefully that goes right for him, and we'll  fight again in December.  Are you surprised at the popularity?  I mean, it's so much bigger than boxing.  Boxing was the sport when we were all growing up, and now, I mean, I hate to say it, but  not many people are checking out boxing anymore.  It's all about, you know, ultimate fighting.  Well, I think it's a great sport.  It includes boxing in it.  Right.  And we do a lot more. 
[01:48:30]  So, I mean, I always thought we could do it as long as we needed that to get that platform  like free TV so people could try us out for free.  It's hard for guys to spend money to watch a fight, fight with a bunch of guys they've  never heard of.  Right.  It was a little odd years ago.  A lot of people were put off by it.  I assume from watching that some type of rules are in place.  Well, they had to be taught it was a sport, because at first, people thought it was just  like gladiators. 
[01:49:00]  For years, I got stuff like, uh, do you guys work out?  I'm like, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know?  I mean, the average fight in the streets, you see guys, they're tired.  You see two guys fight in the street, they're tired in 30 seconds.  Yeah.  They're done.  Yeah, street fights are, uh.  It's a whole, it's a whole different world.  A little different.  A guy like Mike Tyson, how would he do, like, is everybody, Tyson's like kind of like the  measuring point we have for like what a tough guy is.  You're talking Tyson in his prime, obviously.  Well, even now he's in his 30s, he's still a guy that I wouldn't want his fist crashing 
[01:49:30]  on my jawline.  I mean, like, how would a guy, like you said, maybe 10, 12 years ago, do in a situation like  the way you fight?  Well, it's a whole different story.  I mean, he's got one, he's got one shot.  He's got one shot coming in, and when he, when you grab ahold of him, you take him down,  but it is over.  I mean, a guy like, a guy like him would have to learn, he'd have to learn the other parts  of the game.  If he learns the other parts of the game, he could be dangerous, because he does have the  one punch power, and he can keep guys from taking him down, then yeah, he becomes dangerous,  but coming straight from boxing. 
[01:50:00]  He wouldn't intimidate you.  He's not going to lie.  I'll shoot a low single on him from the start anyway, take him down, and then it's over.  Wow.  You use your feet, too.  Yeah, let's go to Trevor in New Orleans.  Trevor, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Trevor's seven years old.  How do you do, bro?  Oh, every year, I'm going to cut my hair like you.  Well, thank you.  That's his hair like Chuck. 
[01:50:30]  He's kicking ass in school.  All right, let's go to John in Hackensack.  John.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you got to ask Chuck about, it was an early fight when he first started coming out.  He fought this juiced up monkey, Kevin Randleman, and he knocked him out in like 20 seconds.  And I remember before the fight started, I was like, this guy is going to get killed.  And he just stopped him in like 20 seconds.  And it was like, it was one of his like big first big fights in the UFC.  Yeah, it was probably my fight where I actually started coming in where I was probably a four 
[01:51:00]  to one underdog at least.  Wow.  I just dropped with a left hook.  I caught him real good and finished it early.  Is he the guy?  He's not the black guy with the blonde hair, is he?  Who is that?  Is that him?  That was the guy.  That might have been a fight I saw because that guy, I saw him fight a couple of times  and I thought, this guy's invincible.  I had never really watched UFC.  And then I saw somebody make short work of him and it might have been the fight you're  talking about.  I couldn't believe somebody had beaten this guy.  I'm like, is this guy tougher than him?  Yeah.  Everybody thought he was coming down from heavyweight. 
[01:51:30]  He's a heavyweight champion coming down to light heavyweight.  And they thought, you know, thought he was going to run that weight class and then I  dropped him early.  Let's go to Brian.  New York City.  Brian?  What's going on, guys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy, by the way.  Thank you, Brian.  You're a good boy.  It's not his birthday.  Shut up.  You're a sick beast.  Every time I watch you, very exciting, very energetic.  What's going on with Silva right now?  And how do you train differently from someone in Pride compared to UFC?  There's no difference training for a guy from Pride to UFC. 
[01:52:00]  But Silva, they pulled that fight.  The Pride guys pulled that fight like a couple of days after they announced it on the UFC.  Right, right.  You know, they took the media thing from it.  You know, I think it was the six-month search guy on Yahoo the next day.  You know, so they took that and they just ran with it.  They just, they still, they took away from me.  But he just got, he just got taken out by Crow Cop anyway.  He wouldn't have been able to fight.  I was supposed to fight.  For those of you who don't know, I was supposed to fight him in November after this show.  I was going to fight him right away after mine if he was okay after his fight. 
[01:52:30]  But Crow Cop put him, knocked him, knocked him out.  Man.  So.  How'd you get the shine of there?  I got it the way I always do wrestling.  Yeah.  Wrestling.  No one wanted to ask you, by the way.  We all see the black guy or the remnants of a black guy.  I'm like, can we ask?  It's all right.  I get to wrestle.  I look like this all through college.  Wrestling in college, I look.  Really?  Wrestling season, I have a black eye on one side or the other.  I wrestle, I have a bad habit of wrestling in my face. 
[01:53:00]  Can I ask the hack?  Can I ask the hack question?  What was the worst injury you had doing this?  Fighting and wrestling.  Well, either one, I guess.  Um, probably, well, I've torn my MCL three times.  Wow.  So, I mean, uh, but that, I tore it once in college and then three times fighting.  But I fought, I fought twice with it, torn, so.  Hmm.  Jesus.  Hey, what do you think of, uh, Joe Rogan?  You know Joe? 
[01:53:30]  I know Joe.  I like him.  Yeah, we love Joe.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a good guy.  Joe's an animal.  Not, not in your class, but, uh, you know, in the comedy circuit, I think he could kick anyone.  He's one of these comedians asses.  Yeah, of these comedians, Joe is God.  In that, in that, in that realm, he's like the funny announcer.  Like, that's the guy that does the jokes.  He's cute.  But Joe has done a lot for you.  Joe has done a lot for you, Steve, because, I mean, he really, uh, I mean, he talks about it.  He's an animal.  He trains with Eddie Bravo, good friends with Eddie Bravo.  Yeah, he brought him on Joe.  I train, I train with Eddie, too.  Now, when I'm in LA, I go to his, his gym and work with him. 
[01:54:00]  He's a great guy.  He's a little guy, too.  He doesn't look like, he's.  He's tough, man.  He's tough.  He's one tough, he's one tough submission guy.  Yeah.  Didn't he submit to Gracie in Brazil or something?  Yeah, he did, in Abu Dhabi.  Yeah.  One of the good guys, they didn't want him to lose.  One win.  We should take a break.  We're a little late here.  You're hanging, right?  Yeah, I'm here.  We got another 15 minutes.  Anything we're promoting that we should talk about before the break?  As he looks around for his handlers.  You know, honestly.  We'll give you the big plug after the break.  How's that?  We also have one of our guys in studio, Master Poe. 
[01:54:30]  He has handed in 20 to 30 questions.  Jesus.  Poe.  He's a huge fan.  We'll get Master Poe into the discussion next.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Oh, my goodness.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Is it the wrong?  Is it the right?  Shuffle, shuffle.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:55:00]  Chuck Liddell in studio.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  He is a badass.  Yes, sir.  And we're all getting along.  I don't even want to imagine what kind of problem there would be.  What do you got?  You got family life, things like that.  Family life.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a boy and a girl.  Yeah.  A son and a daughter.  Oh, see, that's nice.  That'll be eight, nine.  My daughter's going to be nine in September.  My son will be eight in October. 
[01:55:30]  They ever give you a lip?  Eight in October.  They ever give you a lip?  Oh, no.  They're pretty good kids.  They go, you know who I am.  Do you know who daddy is?  Are you crazy?  They're probably not afraid of you, though.  You're just dad.  Yeah.  They're probably not afraid of you.  Well, that's the funny part is like, you know, they're not doing their homework.  You just leave your tapes around for them to be, you know, you might want to take a look  at a few of these kids.  How is it with the chicks, too?  Because, I mean, women like a guy who can protect them and, you know, or in my case,  a man that will pay them for sex.  But, I mean, do you like pull on a girl just because they feel safe with you? 
[01:56:00]  Well, I don't know why.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, girls will feel safe with me, I guess.  I would assume they would.  I mean, they like that tough guy.  I mean, women like tough guys.  Well, some do.  Some don't.  Some do, yeah.  Girls or you, Jimmy.  Feel safe.  Hey, he's pacing back and forth.  Let's get Master Poe into the discussion here.  Poor Master Poe.  Hey, Master Poe.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  You got like 20 questions.  Yeah, you really whipped up quite a few questions there, Poe.  Yeah, well, I had to because, first of all, it's an honor. 
[01:56:30]  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I just want to let you know that this is definitely an honor.  I just want to get through the basic questions, and I want to get rid of the stuff that you hear every day.  And I want to get to the meat of things, if that's all right.  That's all right, man.  It's all good?  I'm good with that.  Oh, how about just a couple questions?  Just a couple?  Yeah, we're not handing the show over to you.  All right, well.  I don't care how tough you are.  Master Poe show.  Right.  Gentlemen.  A couple of questions.  All right, we'll start off. 
[01:57:00]  Ask some of the good ones.  Some of the good ones?  How do you think MMA has evolved?  Or I should say, where did it originate, MMA?  Well, they say Brazil, you know, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, but, you know, once it got here and you start with the UFC in 93, you know, it's evolved.  I mean, it's now truly a mixed martial arts, and that means, you know, it's a mix between, you know, the boxing and striking, the wrestling and Jiu-Jitsu. 
[01:57:30]  And how do you think it has changed the martial arts of today?  I mean, it actually, you know, it added, you know, you had to add wrestling and Jiu-Jitsu, you know, any style that wants to be considered a real fighting style, yeah.  I mean, I think a lot, for a while, I mean, some of the traditional styles, you know, decided somewhere back in the 50s that it's time to keep our style pure and not evolve anymore. 
[01:58:00]  And evolving was bad.  Okay.  You know, but back in the day, those styles were constantly evolving, you know, and.  All right, let me go to the phones.  Look up another question there, Paul.  Ronnie in Florida, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, Chuck, it's an honor and a pleasure to speak with you.  Thank you.  I got just a couple of things, and I'll hang up and just listen.  First of all, what do you think of Tank and Shambak, and how much discipline.  Shambak.  Who's Shambak? 
[01:58:30]  I'm sorry?  Tank and who?  Shambak.  Shambak.  Shambak.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  And how much does discipline come into a fighter, and what is the lifespan of being a fighter?  I know football players get beat up there pretty bad on Sundays.  Well, it's one of those things.  It all depends.  The lifespan of a fighter depends on the guy.  I mean, Randy Couture fought until 42, and actually, I think if he was still fighting, he's still one of the best guys in the world.  Other guys, you know, they're not doing as well. 
[01:59:00]  They're ready to retire earlier.  I think Shambak's plan to retire after this next fight with Tito.  It's on the 10th.  I'm hoping he has a better show than he did last time, and, you know, he's still a tough guy, but, you know, he's ready.  He said, this is his last fight, win or lose.  Should be good.  And then the guy asked a question, which I don't know, why would you ask Chuck Liddell this?  How much does discipline play a part?  Gee, I don't know.  You probably have to work out and eat fairly healthy.  Yeah, just totally give in.  Not at all.  Just show up. 
[01:59:30]  Hope it works out.  Jimmy's going to go into ultimate fighting.  Yeah, you know, I mean.  Give it a try.  Why not?  No discipline.  I'll throw a few punches.  I fall.  Maybe you'll have something to fall back on.  Yeah, the match.  If the commie doesn't work.  You use even just around the house, maybe training, any weapons, any type of sticks?  You know, I did some when I was in martial arts.  I grew up doing martial arts.  I've done some here and there, but I was never much into it anyway.  Yeah.  You know, I got to fire some fully automatic weapons the other day when I was working with 
[02:00:00]  a CHP SWAT team.  That's got to be fun.  Really cool.  How recognizable are you now?  You notice everywhere you go now?  People are starting to notice who you are?  Quite a bit, yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty much everywhere goes.  Yeah, he's branching out all over the place.  We were just talking about that during the break.  He's going to be in an episode of Entourage.  He was on Celebrity Fit Club Sunday.  Oh, I did a thing with Dancing with the Stars.  Dancing with the Stars.  My ex-girlfriend, Willa Ford, is doing it.  Would you kick her partner's ass?  That would have been funny.  You'd just come out flying out and kick her partner's ass. 
[02:00:30]  He's actually a nice guy, but they came out to my last fight and watched the fight  and they filmed some stuff.  And we hung out for a little bit and did a few little goofy things, I guess.  But it's pretty good.  Why would anyone deal?  The ex-boyfriends are always scary when you're in a relationship.  You're always worried about the ex-boyfriend.  And why when a girl goes, oh, there's my ex?  Where?  The one who just knocked that 300-pound man out.  One punch.  Why would you ever call her again?  I would never deal with Chuck's ex. 
[02:01:00]  What if you're a jealous guy?  Are you a possessive dude?  Not at all.  I mean, me and her are just friends.  I mean, we're good friends now.  I'm like, I'm telling you, I'm trying to help her.  I'm doing that show.  She's trying to get all those.  They do half this by voting.  So it's kind of an interesting show.  Last week, she was third on the judges and like 10th overall because of the voting.  And so she didn't do so good on the call-in vote.  And so I've been trying to help her out. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  All right.  You know he'd be the one that got the phone call, though.  He touched me and then he pushed me out of the car.  But no matter how well your relationship's going, how long you're into it, if you're  in love with her for a year, if he shows up and goes, you know, I'd like to work things  out, you just get up and start putting your things into a satchel.  Just leave.  You hand her back over.  No questions asked.  You don't even ask him to move his car if he's blocking you in. 
[02:02:00]  You just sit in the driveway and wait for him.  Okay, sir.  Got it.  That's true.  Let's go back to Master Poe.  Another question for Chuck.  Yes.  Chuck Liddell in studio.  You have a famous gladiatorial celebration that shows the intensity of every vein and  muscle throughout your body.  Where did you get that from?  You know, I don't know.  It just came one time after a fight and I've been doing it ever since.  And the funny thing is a lot of people actually, I mean, I got fans that come up and I don't  know which one I'm more looking forward to.  You're knocking them out or celebrating afterwards. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, man.  It's got to be fun just celebrating right over them.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing down there?  Go ahead, Master Poe.  There are so many.  You know, I'm sorry, guys.  You're just thrilled.  We get it.  We get it.  It's a big moment for Master Poe.  Trust me, no sorries.  I'll be laughing all day.  This is like fighting with sticks.  All day.  Master Poe, just so you know, he's our, over at XM Saddlehead Radio, Master Poe is our  security.  He's what keeps people from going through the door. 
[02:03:00]  He's a sharply dressed individual, but a major problem to opponents, so he's the guy  that protects us.  Yeah.  We've seen him in action, too.  From a Japanese style of martial arts?  Originally, it was Japanese.  It was Shotokan and Jiu-Jitsu.  That's where I first started when I was five, and then from there, I just, I kept on training.  Filipino arts.  Exactly.  Same with me.  He's a lover, too.  Same with me, too.  He likes to sing duets, as well.  But he's a Latin lover, yeah.  He loves the duet.  A little bit.  You studied Kempo.  Yeah.  What style of Kempo is that? 
[02:03:30]  Hawaiian Kempo.  Hawaiian Kempo.  Oh, really?  Kaji Kempo.  Under Florendo Visitacion?  I'm sorry, Edmund Parker.  No, it's Adrian Imparado, Walter Godin, and then my trainer, John Ackerman.  All right.  I got them confused.  Adrian Imparado, and just the Hawaiian Kempo.  Yeah.  But you spell it K-E-M-P-O.  Yes, K-E-M-P-O.  I can't look either thing.  Wait a minute.  I have to look at these.  I have one question from Master Polk. 
[02:04:00]  Master Polk doesn't really question a lot of people.  He's kind of a quiet guy.  I studied under Mr. Honolet.  Yes.  I studied under Don Ho.  He taught me how to do nothing.  I ran out of thought there.  All right.  Ukulele.  One of the questions was, is that what he played?  Yeah.  I hate him.  Were you, this is, or did you just kick ass in grade school?  Or were you always, Paul, I don't understand this one.  Were you bullied when you were a young boy?  That's one question.  Or did you just kick ass in grade school?  That's another question.  And then you said, or were you always a wolf looking for sheep? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, the mic's out.  Paul.  Oh, the mic's out.  That's always a shame when that happens.  Why would it work?  Oh, he found another one.  All right.  You want to explain that?  Well, this one, this isn't working.  Oh, I hear you.  It's working.  Trust me.  All right.  Maybe our headphones aren't working.  You're on.  All right.  The question was, when you were in grade school, did you always kick ass?  That's right.  Yeah.  I was always a fighter growing up. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Were you a problem?  No, I didn't get in too much trouble.  Yeah.  I was smart about it.  I did it more for competition than anything.  I wasn't, I'm not real.  I've got a little kind of laid back, so I'm not easy to push off.  But I like to fight for competition.  I'd imagine you got straight A's in school.  Actually, I did really well.  Of course you did.  You go right up to that teacher and say, it's an A or a duck or sandwich.  I think this was right.  I think you're right, son.  Right.  I have a, what are you, what type of a, you have like a game face you put on. 
[02:05:30]  I mean, you said you're excited when you fight.  Do you have like a certain look you give people?  Because I mean, we're looking at you now.  You look like a pleasant enough fellow.  He's a nice guy.  But coming into the ring.  You know, I honestly, I don't think I changed, but my friends definitely noticed a difference  a couple weeks out from a fight the way I am.  Even his happy face.  The way I carry myself and everything, yeah.  You can tell walking into the ring, it's definitely not a put on, like, oh, I'm going to intimidate  this guy.  You just work yourself up into a state of mind where, you know, that's how you look.  And believe me, when you see you walking out, it is intimidating. 
[02:06:00]  I don't know how anyone in their right mind steps in the ring with this.  And even a guy like me, I hit the heavy bag.  You know, I work out.  Chuck and I probably have that in common.  At least we both hit the bag a little bit.  And I wanted to work out my abs.  I was actually going to ask Chuck what he did for his abs, and my shame took over, and  I decided not to ask.  I'll just do Pilates like the faggot that I am.  Yeah, we stand at Chuck.  We really aren't happy with ourselves, Chuck. 
[02:06:30]  Have you been able to tell?  How about one more question from Master Poe?  Ah, Master Poe.  Well, I can't hear myself.  You are on.  That's okay.  All right, take your headphones off.  That'll help.  All right.  If you can't hear yourself, you might want to take those off.  Okay, your mindset, Chuck.  Talk right into the mic there.  Talking to the mic.  All right.  By the way, I'm not used to this questioning.  I got you.  All right.  I'll do the best thing.  You don't have to tell me.  I got it.  You figured it out.  Like the rest of us.  We learned that.  We're good.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  The mindset that you possess, when you go into the ring, what is it?  It's all business.  Okay.  I mean, it's almost, it could be anybody out there.  I've been training for three months.  I'm not an emotional fighter.  I'm going out there.  I'm trying to set a guy up and hurt him.  So, I mean, that's the plan.  His mindset is just do the job that I was trained to do for the last three months.  Can I just get a follow-up to that?  You said not an emotional fighter.  I mean, you're not going and going, or I hate this thing.  I don't need, like, people ask me a lot of times, do you need to get angry? 
[02:07:30]  Do you need to be, how do you get mad at this guy so you can fight him and try to hurt him?  I'm like, no.  Actually, I'm the opposite.  I want to be calm, and I think anger clouds your judgment.  See, I would try to use reverse psychology.  I would just be very nice to Chuck.  As soon as we stepped into the ring, looking good, you lost a few pounds.  You'd be right.  You give me a hard time.  I tend to gain weight in off-season.  I would try to be too nice to knock out.  Like, Chuck would like me too much to want to punch me in the face.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Boom.  That wouldn't help.  Probably not, no.  You'd like me after.  Even if I like you, I'd be nice to after, or I'd be nice to after and before, but not during.  Do you know how long it would take for you to regain consciousness?  Do you even understand how long it would take?  By the time I regained consciousness, science would have progressed to the point where they could fix whatever damage he did.  You better hope so.  Very good.  Well, he's got his closing statement.  Oh, a closing question?  No, the closing statement.  Statement.  I think you really should tell everybody. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, come on running out of the show.  Okay.  All righty.  Yeah, we can't run out before I talk about the fights coming.  Oh, no, no.  We'll get that big blood.  Hell yeah.  I guess someone slapped me in the back.  Yeah, no.  I don't want him to get mad at me.  No, no.  We will take care of all that.  No, no.  He picks on me.  Where's he at?  This, Po?  Jesus, I have to help you out here?  That's your statement that you want everyone to know today.  Okay.  I don't think anyone here can refute the fact that you are a great fighter.  Thank you.  You are a champion. 
[02:09:00]  And to see you continue to fight would be an honor, and I'm sure that everyone's going  to watch television for that.  Thank you.  Keep on fighting.  I'll keep fighting as long as my body lets me.  Knock them out.  Thank you, bro.  All right.  Master Poe, everyone.  All right.  All right, Master Poe.  Thank you, sir.  What did you want to plug, Chuck?  I know.  Absolutely.  I got the UFC 63s coming up.  Actually, two of my friends fighting.  Two of the fights I really...  One of probably the best fights I don't want to see.  Just because it's two of my friends.  Matt Hughes and BJ Penn are fighting, and both great fighters, both great guys. 
[02:09:30]  It's going to be a great fight.  You must just watch and go like, oh.  Like, you're happy for one, and you feel bad for the other.  Exactly.  No matter which way it goes, I'm going to be happy for one.  Yeah, like I said, upset for the other one.  What is that?  That was at the 23rd, down at the pond, and it's on pay-per-view.  It's going to be a great fight.  23rd September.  Now, and there's also, they get Ken and Tito are fighting on the 10th, and Spike, again. 
[02:10:00]  And I'm hoping Ken does a little better this time, but if not, I'm going to slap Tito  around later after that, so don't worry about it.  I'll take care of him.  That seems to be the only thing that you do take personally is you're fighting with Tito.  Yeah, that probably is probably one.  But the thing is, that's one of the things.  It helps me train for a fight.  But still, even when I walk in the ring with him, I...  You just don't like the guy?  No.  I don't.  So, he's one of the few guys out there that... 
[02:10:30]  Most of the guys I'm okay with, but he's one of the guys...  Why don't you like him?  I don't like...  He runs his mouth too much.  He's one of those guys that he dodged me for a lot of years, and he...  You know, but he'll talk like...  He'll talk a tough game, but then when it comes around to it, it won't pull the trigger.  I don't...  You can talk all the trash you want.  Just pull the trigger when it's time.  You know, take the fight.  Very good.  It's Chuck Liddell, everyone.  Thank you so much.  This was great for us, man.  It was great hanging with you, man.  We really appreciate it.  Jimmy, really fast before we get out of here.  Cleveland tickets for our show.  We are coming broadcast even from Cleveland this Friday, and this Saturday, the Tower 
[02:11:00]  City Amphitheater.  It is the Open Anthony Traveling Virus.  $10 tickets.  Apparently, Cleveland is the poorest city, so we're going to keep them at $10.  That awful Pete was right.  It's presented by Bud Light, of course.  Always worth it.  You can get them at Ticketmaster.  On the show is Robert Kelly, myself, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, Otto and George.  I know Rich Voss, and if I'm forgetting anybody too bad, they'll be there.  So it's this Saturday, our first trip to Cleveland as a show together. 
[02:11:30]  And the last date on the comedy tour.  Last date until next year.  We're going to be pumped.  Chuck Liddell, thank you so much.  Hey, thanks.  Hey, by the way, I got to say I had to read.  Read.  He actually got me to listen to your guys' show a long time, a while back, so.  Oh, cool, man.  I had to say I don't.  I didn't know you listened to us.  That's pretty cool.  That's really cool.  Have someone like him on our side?  Hey, read.  Or maybe he's not on our side.  He listens to hate us.  I don't know.  Chuck Liddell, thanks.  Thank you.  If you're not joining us at XM Satellite Radio, have a great day, and we'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[02:12:00]  Bobby and Anthony are back.  Vincent's going to tell us what he learned this summer.  I spent three weeks with my Uncle Anthony, and I learned a lot from listening to his radio program.  First of all, women on the radio stink on ice.  And all holes should be banned from the airwaves.  Next, it's good to live amongst the Jews.  They have all the money, so they have nice houses, and the crime rates are low.  Opie's name is first because he saved my uncle from blue-collar hell. 
[02:12:30]  Jimmy is a good egg, but I'm not allowed to be alone with him.  Opie and Anthony!  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Outside Free FM.  Yeah.  Some of the fans getting pictures with Chuck Liddell.  That was a great interview, man.  A lot of fun.  There's so much to ask a guy like that, you know?  It's so weird, like, you think, all right, he's a fighter.  But there's so much shit to ask him.  Like, sometimes you get an actor or a musician in there, and there isn't much to ask him. 
[02:13:00]  But just like the whole psychological thing, the physical thing, you know, him just kicking ass.  There's so many cool things to ask a guy like that.  And he was really, like, easy to talk to, relaxed.  He was great.  Well, Colin does a very funny joke, Colin Quinn, about how whenever you walk into a place, each guy sizes each other up.  Can I kick his ass, or can he kick my ass?  But with a guy like Chuck, it's like, all right, he's just, like, probably the toughest guy you're going to meet.  Right.  Because he really loves to fight, and he's great at it. 
[02:13:30]  So you want to get into his mindset and just ask him questions.  Like, I can't comprehend being in his world.  That's what it is.  You can't understand what it's like to walk around like that.  And, yeah, you want to know.  You want to get as close to knowing as possible.  And he doesn't have a traditional build.  Like, he's not, like, he's a big dude, but he's not, like, overly muscled like a steroid guy.  He's a big guy like you can see working at, like, the garage, you know, lifting engine blocks.  Something like that. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, it's not like a trained, worked fighter's body or something.  But he just goes in there.  I've seen so many of his fights.  Just destroys.  Yeah.  Did you guys see his happy face?  We were looking at his happy face.  Yeah.  And it was intimidating as hell.  Yeah.  And he was in a good mood.  He was having a good time.  Big black eye.  Big black eye.  But even his happy face, you could see there's just a problem waiting to happen.  Like, if I had that black eye, I wouldn't be able to go out.  I'd be in the hospital with it. 
[02:14:30]  With a steak on it.  Yeah.  With a big stone steak on it.  And then to, like, all right, I'll just get punched in it a few times because I'm going to be fighting.  Imagine having him as a friend.  You go out to a bar.  You get yourself in a little trouble, but you have him off to the side.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  And then he comes in to save the day.  He's with a chick and leaves you out to dry.  Yeah, all of a sudden you're waiting.  Yeah, the cue you set up happens and he's not around.  And you notice he's going to check out back. 
[02:15:00]  He's the type of guy that would probably, he would be so unthreatened by you.  Like, if he knew he could talk his way out, he'd probably talk his way out of it.  Yeah, before he just.  And would probably punk you going, look, you really shouldn't do that.  Yeah, what are you going to do to me?  Yeah, he's the guy that says, you don't want to do that.  You don't want to do that.  What could you possibly do to me?  And by the way, women, this is exactly what men talk about.  You want to know what we talk about?  Guys like Chuck and what we would do if they were mad at us.  We could spend hours talking about us, figuring out scenarios. 
[02:15:30]  Now, Kenny, you know, obviously we know there are other means of taking care of people  that technology has given us to take people out.  You know what I mean?  Things, you know, fly on the lid, things like that.  But in a straight up fight, you and Chuck, what do you think?  Oh, he'd kick my ass.  Oh, right.  He would be a problem.  Yeah, yeah.  He's definitely.  I mean, he's the champ.  That's all he does is train probably four hours a day, every day. 
[02:16:00]  Like, I respect Jet Li, too, for all his accomplishments.  Yeah.  But I'd fight him in a heartbeat.  Chuck, I'd fucking think twice about.  Yeah.  I'd cry.  We had this conversation.  Imagine, though, seeing Kenny get all beat up.  I'd be weeping for you, Kenny.  Yeah.  I'd be weeping for me.  Because Kenny protects me.  Because you're next.  Yeah.  Kenny all punch drunk.  Yeah.  If he knocks Kenny out, what's going to happen to me?  Well, the thing is.  Oh, stop hitting me.  I run interference.  So if something happens to me, you guys just, like, run away. 
[02:16:30]  That's our time buffer to run.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I take it for the team.  Do you think that, like, you guys would square off?  And he would obviously know that you know how to fight by the way you probably handle yourself.  Right.  But he'd probably be cautious.  Do you think he would just get that first shot in there, that one quick shot, or would it be a kick?  No, I'm done.  Like, whatever I tried to do, take out his kneecap, go for his throat, his eyes.  But, you know, here's a champ that trains four hours a day, every day. 
[02:17:00]  I have your defense.  Grab a handful of your hair and throw it in his eyes.  That's right.  That dry, weak chaff will blind him.  Well, just talk to him.  And when his eyes start to flutter, shut up.  I mean, you know, back in the day, I'm 49 years old now.  Oh, you look good.  Yeah.  You know, back in the day, I used to do some fighting myself, but I got tired of getting beat up for trophies.  But, you know, now I do the best I can for everybody concerned.  If I would chuck, I would get shot. 
[02:17:30]  Because all I would do is hit on guys' girlfriends in front of them.  I don't care.  If your girlfriend's hot, I would just move you aside and take her hand and put it on my dick and go, what do you think?  What are you going to do?  Somebody would shoot you.  Yeah, you'd wind up getting shot.  There are guys that are fucking bigger problems than him because they'll kill you.  Been known to happen.  Yeah.  All right, let's walk.  Okay, guys.  Bunch of men speculating about the accomplishments of the man.  Speculating about other real men.  But, Hughia.  It was a great interview, though.  It was a lot of fun.  Thank you all later.  Tom looking like...  We got a meeting later or something? 
[02:18:00]  Tom looking like a movie star today with those sunglasses.  Yes.  Look at 57th already.  Oh, Anthony, there's so much trash.  What?  Look at this fucking mess.  What's that guy saying?  I don't know.  He looks like 50 Cent, though.  Wait, what is he saying?  What do you got, bro?  This is a goddamn disaster.  Hope he's trying to get in the truck.  Yeah.  He's being jacked.  How you doing, man?  All right.  So, I'm at the man nearly.  I have your sign, you know, behind my truck. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, he's got a wow sticker.  Wait, he's got a sign on, what, a wow sticker?  It's a wow sticker, yeah.  Yeah.  I have it on my truck.  Well, hopefully you get flashed.  And there's our names on the back of the bus in front of you.  It's all about Opie and Anthony in New York.  All right.  Well, all right.  We'll check it out.  Good luck making your delivery today.  It's a red light anyway.  It's not like he's got to go anywhere.  Look at this fucking street.  That's not bad.  I am not driving down this thing today.  Five or six hours, you'd be a crosstown.  It's, yeah.  We haven't even talked about this yet on the radio. 
[02:19:00]  Manhattan's a nightmare today.  Gridlock alert, right?  Once again, every leader of every good and scumbag nation is here at the United Nations.  And it fucks up traffic all over Manhattan.  Isn't it amazing how all these shitbox countries trash America, and yet every one of their fucking  leaders comes here knowing they're going to be allowed to leave?  Dude, the fucking president of Iran is going to open.  He's going to close for Bush. 
[02:19:30]  He's like the closer.  He's the big headline star now.  He's the guy fucking Iran.  Bush is a warm-up act now?  Yeah, Bush is just a warm-up for him.  I will be honest, though.  It is better for all involved that he's involved in the process.  That is a good sign.  The process, he's going to come here and blurt out more propaganda bullshit.  Let him.  And then we let him leave.  We got him right here.  Why not take him out?  Because if not him, another one.  And Musharraf is here from Pakistan.  What's up?  How you doing there, pal?  We better protect that motherfucker. 
[02:20:00]  Without Musharraf, we are in deep trouble.  You know, if the UN was in another one of these savage countries...  Hawaii!  No leader would leave.  All right, no.  Hawaii.  Let me explain about the style of fighting.  Look at the dog.  I just want to jerk it off.  The Hawaiian technique of sumo wrestling.  What?  Did you work out at the Dole Pineapple Plantation?  I hope people enjoyed the Master Poe questions as much as we did. 
[02:20:30]  The whole step was left.  Oh, my God.  At one point, Than...  People were howling in the glass booth.  Yeah.  The dunking booth.  Than turned away.  Than wrote me a note.  I can't look.  My favorite part was the Poe's intro.  Because he had a pre-planned intro, but he said it fairly naturally.  Fairly naturally.  It was read like a hostage note.  Yes.  I don't know.  Can we cross?  Who knows?  I don't know.  I think we could go this way. 
[02:21:00]  It's one of these.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  There it is.  Oh, we got a useless traffic woman in the middle here.  Well, this is a tough job she has today.  This is not her fault.  That'll help.  She can't help it.  Ah, look at her.  Not only is she up, but she's a woman.  I hope her to.  Waddy's gloves got to be white.  Let's cross right here, boys.  You dropped something.  Help.  Fuck her.  How do? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, the CNN bus.  How do?  Top of the morning.  What?  Hi.  How do?  That bus is full of CNN people.  Where?  Right there?  Yeah.  It's a press bus.  A lot of those all over.  Look at this fucking road.  I am going to go to the West Side Highway.  Man.  I'll bet you there is traffic too, sweetie pie.  Get a hotel.  Get a room.  Get a room.  Get a room.  This is going on forever.  Oh, it's just stay forever. 
[02:22:00]  We miss you.  Yeah.  Ant, we hardly knew ye.  Oh.  No, we should do today.  Kiss.  Well, that would be nice too.  It's been a while.  We should let Anthony go home at 10.  No.  And then do the rest of the show from your car because we will get some of the best radio  from Anthony ever.  Oh, my God.  Ever.  Let me tell you.  How about 10.30?  The other day would have been good.  How about 10.30 today?  Your car is out front and you get into this mess.  This thing isn't moving.  Well, westbound is not, my voice has run up, westbound is not bad though. 
[02:22:30]  So if you go to the west side highway and go north.  No.  If I got in this, it probably would make good radio, but I would have a nervous breakdown.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's going to be like this all day.  I'd start driving.  Is it going to get worse as the day goes on?  Yeah, I'm going that way though.  Oh, you are going to go that way?  I'm going to go west and then north and I'm going around this whole mess.  Yeah.  You have to, dude.  Because this, if it's like this now, oh, thank you, sir.  Is Bush sitting in traffic, do you think?  Bush doesn't sit in traffic. 
[02:23:00]  That's got to suck for like Al Gore or any ex-VP.  When you're traveling now, you hit traffic.  You're just a slub.  Because Clinton's probably not in traffic.  They probably block things off for him.  Yeah, I bet they still take care of him.  We've got to say goodbye to the guy from Australia.  Is this it for you?  Oh, when are you going back?  You go home tomorrow, right?  Good morning.  Have a safe flight.  Tomorrow morning.  Yeah.  Save us houses, mate.  20 hours?  Yeah, something like that.  I fly to LA.  I'm in LA for a day and then I fly home.  First class?  No.  No, mate.  You don't got a sleeper? 
[02:23:30]  College student.  You got a sleeper seat?  Nope.  Nothing.  Wow.  I wouldn't mind flying first.  Pale seat?  Heavy with that, but I'm ready.  What do you got to do?  Just get up and walk around a little bit?  Yeah, pretty much.  What kind of plane?  747?  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  747, 400 or something.  20 hours.  You got a lot of room.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not too bad.  You get a lot of room if you're in first.  You have a big sleeper seat.  And coach, there's just more seats crammed together.  You allowed up in that lounge to get a drink?  What's that?  You allowed up in that lounge?  No.  No?  That's first class?  Oh, it's brought to you, yeah.  Food's brought to you.  Drinks are brought to you.  Jesus.  No choice.  Tell me you want to go up in the first class lounge and mingle with a better group of people. 
[02:24:00]  Here's what I tell them.  I say, you don't understand.  My bank account doesn't reflect it.  But I'm a first class customer.  I'm a class act, and I'd like to be treated as such, please.  Oh, well, if we ever make it to your country, where do you live?  Feel free.  Come along.  We've got a massive comedy festival.  That's the thing.  And just nobody, like Melbourne International Comedy Festival.  I think it's bigger than Montreal, but smaller than Edinburgh or something. 
[02:24:30]  But I don't see any of the guys.  Do you guys have XM there?  You don't, right?  No.  Can you listen to us online?  Yeah.  Good man.  Thanks, I'm online, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  So, listen online.  All right.  Yeah.  Give us a call.  All right, our Aussie friend.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, fellas.  We're happy you came.  Bye, man.  So, look, we're making friends all over the world with this show.  Yeah.  Why are there dogs in this stupid building?  There is shit right behind the counter.  Jimmy.  That's not a dog, Jimmy.  That is.  It's a pile of the dog shit.  An employee.  That's the guy that's guarding us from temperism. 
[02:25:00]  No, I want you to be nice today.  I want you to be nice just today.  That log, I'm surprised that log hasn't turned, that log hasn't turned flaky and white.  It's been back there for a while.  Just be nice.  I want you to say hi and greet him nicely.  Today's the day.  Today's the day.  Go ahead.  Go ahead of us and say hi.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Hi, sir.  Hello, sir.  How are you?  You have cancer.  Die.  Die.  Die.  Let's get upstairs.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  That sucks. 
[02:25:30]  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay.  Huh?  Weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of disease.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion.  What's wrong?  Here it comes!  Here it comes! 
[02:26:00]  The Opie and Anthony program.  Elvidos.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one,  with Down Syndrome children.  No, no, no, no.  That's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:26:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We out.  We out.  We out.  We out.  guitar solo 
[02:27:00]  All right. 
[02:27:30]  Ah, come on.  It's not the incorrect password.  What happened?  My cap locks were on.  You hate when you do that?  Stupid cap locks.  They did not say this on TV.  Oh, God.  I love satellite radio.  Are you kidding me?  This one?  Yeah.  Could you just come on the heels of the woman?  Yeah, can we get the woman one again? 
[02:28:00]  The woman one again?  The weather woman.  The woman one.  You know, the one with the woman.  Man, reporters are screwing up all over the place lately.  I think they're just trying to...  Purpose for ratings.  They're shock reporters.  I think they're trying to get on YouTube.  I really do.  Well, it is.  It gives you huge exposure.  It gives you name recognition.  Could get you fired.  No, if they do it right, and it's an honest mistake.  True.  You don't get fired.  Then the video goes up on YouTube. 
[02:28:30]  It's downloaded all over the freaking world or viewed all over the world.  And you become a little more popular for that.  Let's say hi to Jerry in New York.  Jury?  Hey, Jerry.  Jury.  Hey, what's up?  Hi, Jury.  Hey there, Jury.  Hi.  Thank you.  Well, what the...  To make my day wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, Jerry.  What did you call for?  Nothing at all.  I wanted to be that annoying caller. 
[02:29:00]  Mission accomplished.  No, I think Jerry's a good boy.  All right.  Here's the weather girl once again from yesterday before we play the latest one.  Love her.  Each of the winds will be very strong, too, and that will cause coastal flooding, very dangerous  rip currents, as well as very high surf.  Watch out for the rip cunts.  God damn, that's a good one.  Make sure we play it another ten times today.  I can't get enough of that one.  Well, are you ready for the latest one?  Oh, no.  This happened on MSNBC.  Oh, no. 
[02:29:30]  XM only.  Oh.  We can't play this on regular radio.  That's why you have the XM satellite radio.  Continuing to follow the latest developments in the crash of Delta Flight 5191.  49 people killed.  Here's a Blackhawk helicopter surveying.  Oh, no, it isn't.  No, there could not possibly be a Blackhawk helicopter.  Helicopter.  Helicopter.  Although the cock would fit more people than the helicopter does. 
[02:30:00]  Get out of here without those ribs.  These two should do a broadcast together.  Then everything would make sense.  You got rip cunts.  You got black cocks.  Black cocks.  It all gets tied up together.  Wow.  Let us bask in that again.  That could be the greatest thing I've ever heard.  I like that one.  Better than rip cunts?  Yeah, I'll tell you why.  Because rip cunts is kind of...  It's also a word mistake.  But Blackhawk helicopter just says so much about where her head is at. 
[02:30:30]  Right down in a black lap.  A Blackhawk.  Blackhawk.  Yeah, I guess you could Blackhawk.  I agree with a guy from Cell Phone.  Change the fucking XM intro piece.  Yeah, I don't know why we don't change any of the opening pieces.  The current one has been playing for long enough.  Who hears it?  As long as I don't have to hear it, I'm busy.  We have to update the production.  We have to.  It's time.  The opening, even at the other show, I specifically said...  Here's MSNBC once again. 
[02:31:00]  I'm scared.  Continuing to follow the latest developments in the crash of Delta Flight 5191.  49 people killed.  Here's a Blackhawk helicopter surveying the scene.  We know the NTFV.  A Blackhawk.  She really says it.  A Blackhawk helicopter.  Wow.  He loves it.  You came here looking for a helicopter.  Oh, he's calling us.  Yes, he is.  I'm very psyched.  We didn't even promote that today.  Mr. Chris Hansen.  Yeah, we should have mentioned that on 3FM. 
[02:31:30]  Let them know what they were missing here, which is Chris Hansen from Dateline is calling  in at approximately...  15, 20 minutes.  The child predator special that they do.  Yeah.  Hey, let's go to Josh in California.  Josh, what's up?  I'm here to break...  Fuck, I stumble, but I don't give a shit.  Don't worry about it, Chuck.  Poe calls, man.  Yeah.  He creeped out Liddell talking about going into that rage with the veins and the muscles  on it.  It's just like he's reading out of fucking Rent Boys or something. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, that was a weird question.  I thought Poe did pretty well, considering he was a nervous Nelly, but when he said, you  know, the bulging veins, and sometimes it will appear that you have an erection in your  shorts, it's just a little creepy.  I don't know why.  And having said that, Poe would easily whoop my fucking ass.  I'm out, though.  Yes, he would.  Poe Liddell would be an interesting, I think if Liddell landed a punch, Poe would be in 
[02:32:30]  deep trouble, but...  Yeah, where are the questions from Poe?  There are some terrific ones on there.  Well, don't use my copy.  It's signed, Ethan.  I'll kiss you right on the stomach.  You got yours signed?  Yeah, I got Chuck to sign it.  I didn't have any UFC things.  I said, that'd be kind of fun.  Jimmy, can you read the questions from Master Poe for Chuck Liddell?  I'm going to read them in order.  All right.  Here's how it starts.  I would like to get rid of the basic questions that you hear all the time.  Once we do this, we can then move on.  Dot, dot, dot.  Dot.  It's nice when you have a natural hello written out. 
[02:33:00]  I'm surprised you didn't put pause, mouth open, words come out, pause, breathe.  When did you first have an interest in martial arts?  Who did he...  Poe think he is, Charlie Rose?  What martial arts styles have you studied?  I noticed you have a Kempo tattoo on your shoulder.  I don't like the casualness of that, like it just came in, like, to his head there.  Holy shit, let's all just get Kempo tattoos.  I think we should.  Because it looks like that makes you look tough.  Like you know the Kempo tattoo on your shoulder. 
[02:33:30]  What style of Kempo is this, and who was your teacher?  How did Kempo play a role in your life?  Were you bullied when you were a young boy?  Or did you just kick ass in grade school?  Were we always a wolf looking for sheep?  What?  Were you always a what looking for what?  I must have read that wrong. 
[02:34:00]  I don't think he would be flattered by that question, by the way.  Wouldn't he be a wolf looking for other wolves?  Yeah.  Instead of going for the easy sheep?  I was implying that even other wolves would seem like easy prey, gentlemen.  You have an impressive record, and there is no one here.  And I spell no with a K as it's knowledge.  There is no, as in to know something, as opposed to the NO version that a lot of people would use there. 
[02:34:30]  You have an impressive record, and there is no one here.  I guess spellcheck wouldn't catch that one, because technically it's correct.  And if I spelled impressive right, we all know spellcheck was being used, gentlemen.  There is no one here that can refute your record or your fighting ability.  That's a statement.  I decided to make a statement.  You are a champion in this form of combat, and you are world known. 
[02:35:00]  Wait, wait.  Someone has a really good idea.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Jimmy.  No, it's okay, because it's going very well, but this might even be better.  All right.  Pat in Boston.  Pat.  You know, dude, I think it would be good if you read the questions like Bob Kelly.  You know, dude.  Well, here's what.  Poe put a couple of statements in here.  Yeah.  Bob wouldn't ask questions.  What Bob would try to do is bond as if two men of a similar ilk were talking, because  Bob is that dumb. 
[02:35:30]  And here's what Bob, the statements that Poe wrote that Bob would actually use.  Dude, you have an impressive record, and there's no one here that can refute your record or  your fighting ability.  Dude, you're a champion in this form of combat, and you are the world known.  It's the type of thing that's stupid, would rehearse in front of the mirror over and over.  But his questions, Bob wouldn't really ask questions.  Okay.  Because Bob's a pontificator.  Well, you could do the other one, because this one was, Poe did this one to Chuck Liddell. 
[02:36:00]  Do it as Bob Kelly.  You have a famous...  Dude, you have a famous gladiatorial celebration that shows the intensity in every vein and  muscle throughout your body.  Does it?  No, dude, you know, the thing...  And Bob wouldn't say, where did that derive from?  Bob would speculate.  Right.  Dude, that must derive from when you were a kid. 
[02:36:30]  Chuck would go, no, it just happened.  No, dude, I saw a special.  When you were a kid, you would always do that.  No, I'm the guy.  Hold on.  Ian has his favorite part of the Poe interview.  Ian.  You missed the point.  And I have my favorite part, but I'll go ahead.  All right.  Ian, go ahead.  Hi.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  The best part of that interview was when Poe asked Chuck, you know, where he went to  school, and then started naming off all these trainers, like, you know, Mr. Hossa-Wossa  and Wossa-Wossa. 
[02:37:00]  Yes.  And then Chuck goes, no, actually, it was Master Frank and Master John.  Well, I didn't hear that.  Did I miss that?  Yeah.  I didn't hear it.  That was the best part of it.  Yeah, there were a couple of names that were, like, from Hawaii, and it was, you know...  And then it turned out to be Master Frank.  It's called the Waka Hula-Wana.  Hula-Wala.  And it was like, no, you know, it's Bob.  Yeah.  It was Ted in Ronkakama.  Right.  Fine.  All right, Ian.  That's the Poe's the dumbest.  Thank you, Ian.  Poe was a little nervous.  This is a good statement here.  I bet you get nervous.  There are so many young fighters today who are wondering how do you have this mindset 
[02:37:30]  that is focused and determined to take your opponent apart.  Are there a lot of fighters wondering that?  Are you speaking for them?  And this one I love.  Well, tell us where you get your psychology in combat.  All right.  Who instilled this unbeatable mental toughness, this psyche that you possess when you enter the octagon?  See, here's the beautiful part.  Uh-huh.  He put a dash between un and beatable. 
[02:38:00]  Unbeatable.  Yeah.  Not unbeatable.  It makes me want to put an ST and then a dash and a UPID.  Unbeatable.  All right.  It just goes on and on.  It's just an endless litany of questions slash statements slash thought starters. 
[02:38:30]  You know, Rocky Road on chocolate mint chip.  Describe what is on your mind when you're face-to-face with another fighter.  Finger in the ass or a ball jiggle?  Cut or uncut?  Boxers or briefs, Chuck?  Gentlemen.  Dude, when you're in combat like that, you know, dude, you got to just, you got to put your mind like when I was in Juvie Hall. 
[02:39:00]  Dude, it's just a matter of all.  He stole a gumball machine and went to Juvie Hall, that horse's ass.  Oh, what is he, a little rascal?  He acts like he did fucking time in Leavenworth.  Dude, when I was...  Shut up.  Juvie.  Oh, I looked at put my fist right in his sunglasses.  No, but it's really not like that.  No, no, it is.  Dude, when we fucking talked about Travolta,  No, dude, he got that after Pulp Fiction.  Well, no, actually, he did have planes before that.  Dude, no, that was his comeback. 
[02:39:30]  I saw a special.  He's been a pilot.  He had them.  Dude!  The pontificating idiot that he is.  Are you nervous before you fight?  You had four losses, and then he names all the people that beat him.  That's smart.  Yeah.  And do you feel martial arts have evolved through the years?  Oh, my God.  It just goes on and on and on.  Oh, my God. 
[02:40:00]  The last question.  Yeah, go ahead.  Please read it.  No, you go ahead.  Your girlfriend, Willa Ford, is involved in a dance competition.  How do you want the MMA world, if not the martial arts world, to support this cause?  Well, it's an ex-girlfriend, right?  Yeah.  It's a hard question to answer.  Well, I'd like the entire martial arts community to get together and denounce non-dancers.  And beat them.  How do you support the cause?  Kenny, I want to... 
[02:40:30]  Is it a cause, really, the dancing show?  No.  I'd like them to vote for her.  Thank you, Kenny.  I'm going to order something, young fella.  All right, let's go to Charlotte.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I just want to let you know, y'all three look like the biggest douchebags next to Chuck Liddell.  And thank God you didn't order anything to eat or he would have left.  Yeah?  What do you mean, sir?  Why do we look like douchebags next to Chuck?  Sir?  I can't even talk to you, Jimmy.  You make me laugh every single day.  Thank you.  Now we like Chuck. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, we had a good time with Chuck.  He was really...  He was a...  Chuck was a fun guy to talk to.  We could have had him on for an hour and a half, and he's just an interesting guy, man.  He was really fun to talk to.  Definitely.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Chris?  All right, Chris.  And he's a quiet guy.  Like, when you hear him talk, he's like a kind of a soft-spoken dude.  And we've all seen the rage that comes out of him or whatever the energy, if he's not  angry at the movies.  You pick up on the breathing?  Oh, my God.  No one was going to even say anything.  Usually when a guest...  Like a bull.  Like a bull.  That's exactly what he sounds like.  Like a bull.  Yep. 
[02:41:30]  Usually when a guest does that, I know it's annoying to the listener, so you try to tell  him, you know, back off on the mic or something.  Oh, when Voss does it, we just hammer him.  Yeah, no one's going to say anything to Chuck Liddell about his breathing.  Hey, Chuck, knock it off.  He fought with a fucking torn MMA, whatever the fuck it was.  Because he didn't want them to know he had a tear.  Yeah.  If I had a hangnail, I'd cancel the fight.  He can't breathe through his nose.  His nose has probably been broken so many times.  Yeah, been broken.  It's all through the mouth.  That's what that's all about.  So that's what that's about?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He can't breathe through his nose.  Really?  Can't they fix that?  Yeah. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, but then he just breaks it next fight.  Oh, so he'll fix that after he's done fighting.  Yeah.  I guess.  He has a big head to it.  He's a fucking tough dude to knock out, man.  Chuck has a solid head.  Everyone's a tough guy now.  Talking about Chuck.  No, no, I'm not...  Breathe, big head.  I don't mean a big head.  He's 6'2".  See him on the fucking street.  As Anthony sips his smoothie.  Yeah, that's right.  I'm drinking his smoothie and have nothing but praise for that gentleman.  No, no, no.  I don't mean big head.  We had the biggest laugh at your expense.  Look.  When I said, now Chuck, I'm a pussy.  I think it was obvious to him that we all were pussies in that room. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I said, I'm a pussy.  You had to point it out to him just in case he was wondering.  As far as Chuck was concerned, he was doing the view.  Right.  Yeah.  And then we just laughed way too hard.  What's that about?  You got a route?  I got a route, but it's funny because I think this is a little jab at Club Soda Kenny by Mike  with the instructions, one, walk to car, two, start car.  Well, he didn't mention give the tag in. 
[02:43:00]  How are you going to get in your car?  You can't even receive your vehicle unless you give the ticket to the guy in the glass booth.  What do you think?  You just go up and grab your car, walk to car, start car.  You don't have the keys.  By the way, Kenny.  Yes?  You're lovely.  Yes, sir.  I'm getting ready a lot faster, so now I walked outside today, and it's pitch dark, and Kenny's  car's parked, but he's not in the car. 
[02:43:30]  And then I see him coming in the distance with my little bag of berries.  Ew.  Like fucking Yogi Oaf.  Just a picnic basket full of berries.  He's walking down the sidewalk all happy, happy to be alive with a bag of berries for me.  Ew.  Because he had a few minutes to kill, right?  Because it wasn't 4.55 yet.  No, I make sure I get there five minutes earlier to stop at the store so you're not inconvenienced.  I felt bad. 
[02:44:00]  You don't have to buy my berries.  No, that's what I do.  Kenny's just an organized sociopath.  He is so organized.  I guarantee you he's got, like, hitchhiker's driver's licenses piled up in a fucking shoebox somewhere.  She was lovely.  I strangled her with my shoelaces.  They call them trophies.  Do they?  She was a lovely girl on her way home from school.  After I put my penis in her mouth and shot her, I cut a lock of her hair off. 
[02:44:30]  You could still smell her shampoo in it.  Look.  Smell.  Sometimes I put her hair on mine and pretend my hair has bounce.  Kenny's hair should be fucking blowing by a screen in the desert.  It's a fucking...  I don't even want to look at him.  It's a tumbleweed.  The man has a tumbleweed on his head.  Sorry, Kenny. 
[02:45:00]  It's all right.  It's clean.  It is clean.  Kenny's clean.  He uses shampoo and conditioner in one.  No, he doesn't.  He fucking uses a leaf blower.  He blows grit and cigarette butts out of it.  This is a nipple I bit off.  In anger.  I kept it in a baggie that I bought, one of those rotten poop peel baggies that seals.  Seals them fresh.  A vacuum seal. 
[02:45:30]  She made me angry.  This is the only African American I ever killed.  I severed her foot and yelled racial epithets.  I did that because normally serial killers only kill within their own race, so I wanted  to throw them off.  I don't know who he is.  They'll call him the no-cursive killer because all of his notes are in fucking stick letters. 
[02:46:00]  They have all DNA evidence and they don't even know it.  They think it's just twigs that were dropped at the scene, but it's his hair.  She was buried in a pile of leaves of hair.  I pose my victims also.  Why do you leave them in provocative poses? 
[02:46:30]  To shock.  The poses aren't even sexual.  It's just them with their chin resting on their fists looking like they're actually listening  and interested as opposed to bored.  Look at this prepubescent girl hitchhiking.  He has all the, he'll pose all the girls naked and looking at their watches with their  eye raised like they're impressed that he's there early.  He's the five minute early killer.  All their watches are set to five minutes before their deaths and stopped. 
[02:47:00]  That's fantastic.  All right.  But then I arranged the time and date of all their funerals for the family.  So they all get there on time.  She wanted to be buried on a satin feather pillow.  Who doesn't love Kenny?  Come on. 
[02:47:30]  I have to fetch Jimmy's food now.  Kenny just has a way of giving you news that just seems like foreboding in bed.  Kenny's been bad at giving good news.  Like the news could be, hey, look, man, are we leaving?  What time are we leaving?  I want Nathaniel to leave a little early.  But he'll make it seem like a conflict.  It's like, what time are we leaving?  Well, Nathaniel wants to leave early.  Like a problem.  It is an inherent problem no matter what he tells you.  But that's not a big deal.  No, I know. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  No, it's okay.  Why don't you say it like that?  But Nathaniel wants to leave early.  He doesn't want to leave when you do.  Oh, shit.  It's all in the delivery.  Oh, God.  It's not what you say.  It's how you say it.  He's the bedside manner of fucking, of Olivier and the marathon man.  Yeah, I know.  All right, we're going to break because we're going to get ready for Chris Hansen.  Here's how that would have been.  We've got to break because Chris Hansen's calling in.  Like he's doing something horrible. 
[02:48:30]  No, nothing.  I'm just telling you he's calling in.  Oh.  Mike, Kenny and Poe sound exactly alike.  Before you instant feedback that, I know it.  Continuing to follow the latest developments in the crash of Delta Flight 5191.  49 people killed.  Here's a Blackhawk helicopter surveying the scene.  We know the NTSC.  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  And a yam bag jet is flying over.  All right, we'll break with that. 
[02:49:00]  Chris Hansen on the show in maybe a few minutes here.  Mm.  The virus is spreading.  The virus is inside us.  O-A-Virus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from words you dump on Norton's belly,  the only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly. 
[02:49:30]  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  The NTSC Show. 
[02:50:00]  We got great ratings in New York.  Yes.  On 3FM in New York, we got a trend in yesterday.  We did very, very, very well.  Nice.  So I want to thank the people that are supporting our commercial radio stations.  Yes, absolutely. 
[02:50:30]  Make sure you support our commercial radio stations.  And that's all I could say about that.  But ratings came in yesterday, and they were very, very, very good.  That's why we're getting better guests and all that stuff.  It really, it all ties in nicely.  More gigs.  Yeah, we wouldn't have gotten Chuck Liddell.  More things.  But Jet Li.  Jet Li was a fun interview.  I mean, there's a language barrier.  He's a big one.  But he was great, man.  Yeah, that was fun to listen to on the replay.  Fucking Jet Li.  I was very impressed with that big celebrity. 
[02:51:00]  We had two men that could just kick the shit out of us in a row.  Yeah.  By the way, I'm obsessed with my Inno, Helix, whatever the hell mine's called.  An Inno?  Is it the Inno?  I think.  Or the Helix?  It's almost.  They got to market that thing better.  Where's Elo?  Where is the Elo?  I haven't seen him on cam or anything.  I don't know.  I don't like it.  He didn't email me, though.  You know what I do with the Inno?  You know, because I like to work out and stuff, and I walk around Manhattan, so I want my tunes 
[02:51:30]  like anyone else when you're wandering around.  Sure.  So with the Inno, I record a channel.  Mostly Ethel, but then I'll go top tracks, and then maybe Lucy.  You know, I'll jump around a bit, maybe go chill for a while, so I'll record for like  two or three hours, and then I can go to the gym, and I start searching, you know, I search  around and see what songs I want to hear from the ones I just recorded, and if I really  like a song, I highlight and throw it on a playlist.  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question now, because my reception in my gym is not good. 
[02:52:00]  No, that's why my reception stinks.  That's why I record ahead of time.  So you don't need reception to listen to once you record it?  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  I record a channel for like two or three hours, and then I look, and I play the songs  that I need for my workout, and if I really like the song, I throw it to a special playlist.  That's nice.  And then I have that song whenever I want to hear it.  Yeah, I just didn't know if it recorded it on the hard drive of your actual unit or  on a separate unit.  That's great.  I don't understand why XM isn't just selling just a ridiculous amount of these things.  Yeah.  Maybe they are.  I don't know, but you don't really feel the buzz in these units yet, in my opinion. 
[02:52:30]  You will.  Let's make it the word across.  The whole FCC thing just got resolved, right?  Yeah.  Because with the iPod and stuff, that's obviously great, and they're tiny and compact like the  Inno and the Helix.  In all fairness, even smaller.  But you've got to find the music, and then you've got to download it to your iPod.  I mean, this is all set for you, because you're listening to the channels you really like to  begin with, so you're going to like most of the stuff anyway.  And you can listen to this show, or you can listen to Fox News.  Yes.  You can listen to stuff that you can't listen to on an iPod, really. 
[02:53:00]  Right.  You know what I got to notice?  I listened to a little bit of that Sirius satellite radio.  Oh, because you got it in the Mustang.  It's in my car until I change it over.  Were you a Howard fan?  I got to deal with it.  Howard fan.  Another clone.  Yeah, I'm one of the 6,000 that subscribe per day, as per Howie Math.  But their jocks are either bad celebrity jocks on the Decades channels, or really yapping, 
[02:53:30]  self-important, think they're more important than the just music.  Yeah.  Like, you're paying to hear the music without all the yapping of a jock?  Give me the fucking music.  You can backsell some stuff, if you want, in between a liner or something like that.  Well, the place is filled with old-school radio, guys.  That's the problem.  They can't think out of the box.  And Barry Williams. 
[02:54:00]  And the 70s station is, Barry Williams does it.  Barry Williams was a friend of ours, still is.  I don't know, I haven't seen him.  You know, he's working over there, so I don't think we'll be able to have him on the show.  But everything, every song that he plays, that he talks about, has to have some kind of Brady reference.  All right, we get it.  You were on the fucking Brady Bunch.  Enough.  You tune over to the 80s station, you got that Nina Blackwood that used to be on MTV.  She was killed in a movie called Vice Squad.  She was beaten to death with a pimp stick. 
[02:54:30]  I would love to meet her.  She was fantastic.  You're not going to hit me, are you, Ramrod?  But she just doesn't shut up again.  She's like Carol Miller here in New York.  She's like past her prime.  She's a babbling ass.  She won't shut the fuck up.  And she sounds a little bit like Katharine Hepburn.  Yes.  She's got something going on.  She's starting to get like a shaky old voice.  And the one thing I noticed more than anything else, dead spots.  I drove yesterday like a maniac all over Long Island and got to see so many fucking dead spots. 
[02:55:00]  Now, with my XM, there's a couple of places under a tunnel around a weird curve where there's a lot of trees.  I'll notice it'll drop out.  I don't know what XM.  It comes right back.  Really fast.  Speaking of the tunnels and stuff, I don't know what kind of tunnels.  I think they have repeaters all over the place, right?  I get my XM into the Lincoln Tunnel.  Not all the way, obviously.  But I'm starting to look at the XM and listen to a song going, this has to cut out by now. 
[02:55:30]  And then, you know, it finally cuts out.  Yeah.  They've got repeaters and stuff.  Serious, man.  It dropped out so many times to where I thought I was getting a phone call because when the OnStar rings,  but I don't have OnStar on the Mustang, but I'm used to it in my Escalade.  When it rings, your music cuts out, and then after like two or three seconds, you hear the phone ring.  And I kept expecting a phone call because the dropouts were that long on Serious. 
[02:56:00]  It's just, you know, awful.  I used to have both.  You did?  Haven't for a long time.  Yeah, when we were deciding which company to go to.  And it was obvious that we should go to XM.  Their unit was massive, and it was like glued to my dashboard.  I'm reminded of my unit.  That unit they gave me.  They screwed holes into the console of my Mountaineer. 
[02:56:30]  Mine was glued.  It was like a huge metal plate that this thing sat on.  And then the metal plate had to be glued to my dashboard.  And then I had to cover it with hats and stuff so I wouldn't get broken into.  Yeah, my girlfriend had one in her Jeep.  And after about a month, when she hit the gas, it just fell off of the dashboard.  The little dashboards on the Jeep, it just fell off.  And it was on there with tape.  Yeah.  The guy had taped it on there.  All right. 
[02:57:00]  Nice installation.  Oh, Chris Hansen.  Chris, hold on one second.  Greg, California.  Hey, guys.  Make it fast.  We got Chris Hansen on hold.  Okay.  Sorry.  I bought the Eno about three months ago, man.  It's the best thing you could ever have.  I think the only reason it's not caught on so much is just the price and then the fact that, you know, like the iPod, you can get pictures and things like that on it and stream videos and stuff.  But once they do that, it kicks off.  It's the best thing I ever bought. 
[02:57:30]  And the thing is so freaking light.  It's just, oh, man, I love it.  All right, Greg, thank you.  Hey, thanks.  We can do a little more tech talk after we talk to Chris Hansen.  Mr. Hansen.  Good morning, guys.  Chris Hansen, one of our favorite guys on TV.  But I'm sure you hear that a lot.  Now and again.  Very popular.  How are you?  Very popular guy these days.  Very good.  We're doing well.  I was good until I walked into that kitchen and saw you.  I just wanted a cookie, Chris.  Just a cookie. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, imagine some poor bastard thinks it's a friend's house and walks in.  How does it, it's got to be great for Chris.  Not only are you doing your job as a journalist and you're on TV and you're getting more and  more famous, but you're getting to catch pedophiles.  I mean, you have the best gig in the world.  Well, I'll tell you what.  You know, it's been good.  We've raised a lot of awareness.  I think we've created a dialogue between parents and kids and students and teachers.  And on this issue, I think it's great.  In terms of the story, I mean, obviously this is very compelling television and we try to 
[02:58:30]  balance this every time we do it to make it good journalism as well.  Now that has to be hard for you because when you first started doing this, I'm sure it  was pretty much based on really digging in, seeing how big of a problem this is and really  showing the public that.  But what it has turned into is really this kind of voyeuristic thing on a twisted lifestyle  and it's really caught on. 
[02:59:00]  So have you had any reservations about how popular it's become as entertainment and to  balance that out as a news guy?  Yeah.  I mean, when we first did this, you know, a couple of years ago in Long Island, you know,  I was driving over to the house and I'm thinking in my mind, you know, is anybody going to  show up, you know, that I just waste like thousands of dollars of NBC's money, you know?  And the next thing I knew, the cell phone rang.  It was my producer, you know, panicky because two guys are doing 45 minutes and, you know,  would I be there on time? 
[02:59:30]  And of course, you know, everybody saw the rest of it.  It was just a parade of potential predators.  But yeah, I mean, every time we do this, we sit down and say, okay, you know, our guy's  still showing up.  Is this still worthwhile?  You know, we believe that this is, you know, the continuation of covering a story just like,  you know, any other topic, you know, just because you do the story once doesn't mean  the problem's over, doesn't mean it's not worth reporting on it.  Even with all the attention we've gotten on this, you know, the last two investigations  that we did that we'll hear in the next couple of weeks in Northern California and Southern 
[03:00:00]  California, you know, we had 28 guys show up in three days in Northern California, 38  guys show up in Southern California.  In Southern California, we had a guy show up who surfaced in our investigation last January  in Riverside, was caught and prosecuted there, shows up in this house.  After an online chat where he said he was in court the previous day on the old case,  talks about being in trouble before making sure that this girl isn't a cop and shows  up anyway.  Yeah.  Legally, can't you just shoot him in the kitchen?  You should be able to come out with, hi, I'm Chris Hansen with a gun. 
[03:00:30]  Hey.  And just shoot him.  What is the, you've heard a lot of great excuses.  Some have probably not aired.  What is like, would you say the worst excuse you have heard from anybody in a moment of panic?  Like, this is the most ridiculous thing another adult has said to you.  The worst excuse was, well, there's two.  I think there's a tie.  One is that I was just driving along and I got lost all of a sudden.  And this looked like a friendly place to stop and get directions.  The second one was a guy who said, I just came here to check out the house. 
[03:01:00]  It's for sale, isn't it?  I said, no, it's not for sale.  He said, well, I thought it was.  I said, well, how did you find out that this house is for sale?  Well, actually, a friend of mine sent me over here to check it out.  I said, well, really, I said, what's the friend's name?  He told my name.  I said, what's his number?  And I pull my cell phone and suddenly the story changes again.  You always got an answer, though, Chris.  It's so frightening when you come walking out of there.  Do they think you're a cop?  Well, I think some of the people think that I may be with law enforcement. 
[03:01:30]  I think some of the people may think that I'm the angry father who's just walked in.  We definitely have had that response.  And I think some people realize that it's Dateline.  And we're seeing now in the chats that people are asking the decoy, you know, you know,  you with Dateline, and some guys get it mixed up, and they say 60 Minutes or some other show,  but they're referring, obviously, to us.  You know, is this Dateline?  You know, they're doing the show, and the decoy says, well, I don't know what Dateline is.  And, you know, in spite of all that, you know, these guys keep showing up. 
[03:02:00]  And even when I walk out and there's this recognition in some cases, you know,  they stay more often than not and talk.  And I think, you know, for some of these people, at least, there's this relief.  It's like they know they've had an issue for some time.  They know they've had to deal with it.  And now they're in this house, and at least it's over, and they can get some help or do  whatever they need to do.  How could you legally, because this is my question, because you always have to get people  to sign releases.  I was doing something for Comedy Central recently, a man on the street, and we had to get people 
[03:02:30]  to sign releases or we couldn't use it.  How do you get around that?  Because I'm sure none of these guys are signing releases.  Right, we get around it because it's a news program, so we're covering a news story by  doing it.  If you were doing an entertainment show like, you know, Taxicab Confessions on HBO or something  like that, yeah, you would have to get a release.  Okay, but for news, you don't need it.  Exactly.  Now, Chris, why do you think the extreme popularity of this, what is it about this story and this  subject that makes people want to tune in week after week and just keep watching these 
[03:03:00]  things happen?  Well, I think it's a combination of things.  I think, one, it's something that a lot of folks are concerned about.  Two, you know, it's amazing to people how guys who look like, you know, everyday, workaday  guys, clean cut, you know, they don't have the word predator tattooed to their forehead,  will get involved in this conversation.  A conversation that sometimes involves a grooming process over several weeks and show up at this 
[03:03:30]  house.  These are guys who, you know, have been teachers, doctors.  We had a Homeland Security federal agent.  Yeah, I remember him.  It's not just, you know, Aqualong walking in here.  I mean, these are guys who you stand next to in line at the grocery store.  Do you see some type of almost candid camera popularity with the program?  Like, all right, here it is.  You know, as a viewer, you're almost brought into it as a candid camera type thing where 
[03:04:00]  here he is.  He doesn't know what's going to happen.  We all know.  And you're waiting for the payoff.  And to me, that does seem a bit more like an entertainment program than a news program.  Well, I think there's an element of that.  I mean, obviously, people, you know, like being taken in places where they can't go on  their own.  And this, you know, the dynamics of this are exactly that.  I mean, they're looking into a conversation that is not supposed to be taking place. 
[03:04:30]  It could be taking place with their kid, you know.  And so they want to know about it.  And then all of a sudden, this guy is showing up.  They know that, you know, he's going to walk around and talk and have the chat with the  decoy.  And then I'm going to come out and confront him.  And then, you know, obviously, he's going to be arrested.  And he'll go through the criminal justice system after that.  So, yeah, I mean, clearly, there's that element of being taken someplace where  people normally wouldn't be able to go.  And each guy, you know, is different. 
[03:05:00]  I mean, it's not like we get the same response over and over again.  And it changes with each investigation we do.  I mean, we had a situation in Long Beach recently where I walk out.  The guy figured out pretty quickly what was going on.  And we had this real intense, dramatic conversation about his problem, what led  him there, what he was going to do, what he was going to do in the future. 
[03:05:30]  And it was almost like he wouldn't leave because he knew what was going to happen next.  Why are they so open to tell you so much that can probably, and I want to ask you that also,  can probably get them in trouble later in court?  I mean, can your show be used as evidence in court?  And why do they open up so much, do you think, personally?  Well, I think personally because, you know, I am genuinely interested in what brought them there. 
[03:06:00]  You know, I'm not there to beat them up or to be the police or to be the moral arbiter.  You are a bit condescending toward them, I've got to say.  And it has to be.  And you should be.  And look, personally, you look at some of these people, and I'm surprised you don't have the  camera guy just lob the camera at their heads.  But, you know, it must be rough to sit in front of some of these animals and have to be civil. 
[03:06:30]  Well, you know, again, my job is not to dish out punishment.  My job is to gather information, and so, you know, I try to balance that, and each situation is different.  Now, clearly, you know, I have a pretty good idea of who's coming in.  You know, I've read the chat log, you know.  Oh, yes, you have.  And you read it right back to them.  Right, exactly.  So, you know, so I know what they've said, and they often don't know that I know.  So it starts with a lie, and I can let them tell the story for a while, and I can say, well, you know, 
[03:07:00]  wait a minute here, I've got the chat.  So, you know, how do you square that with, you know, what you've said right here?  And is it used in court?  The chat log, the way it's set up.  I mean, the program itself, actually, him walking into the house, is any of that used in court?  Typically what happens is, you know, the finished product that airs is what's used in court.  But the way it's set up is, I mean, the first couple investigations we did did not involve law enforcement.  And what we ultimately did was we set up a situation where the computer online watchdog group, 
[03:07:30]  Perverted Justice, you know, acts as a consultant to us, and they have the decoys who do the chats.  They provide us the chat logs separately.  They provide the chat logs to law enforcement agency, which conducts a parallel investigation, has its own setup,  you know, does not go into the house, has the house next door, or a motorhome or something.  And, you know, we do our thing.  Perverted Justice provides us with information. 
[03:08:00]  It provides the law enforcement with information so that when we're done,  law enforcement can step in, and they'll do their own questioning of the person and, you know, take it from there.  And you'll never actually know how many people you've deterred,  but I guarantee you the public humiliation of being called out like that with your family, your friends, your co-workers,  I guarantee you that has deterred more people than you'll ever know.  You'll never know who was going to do it and didn't.  Right. I think so. I think it's head deterrence. 
[03:08:30]  But at the same time, I mean, we keep seeing guys show up in record numbers.  Any guys show up in Opie and Anthony t-shirts?  Not yet.  I'll keep you posted, though.  Thank God.  How many of these? Is this just limitless? Is it never-ending?  How many of these you got planned?  Well, what we're going to do is, you know, we're on this coming Friday and, you know,  the four Fridays after that between the rest of Georgia and the Northern California, Southern California investigation. 
[03:09:00]  And then, you know, we'll stop and take a look at it again.  I mean, you know, I've got a lot of other different stories I'm working on.  You know, we've been able to kind of take this enterprising, sting-type investigative model, if you will,  and apply it to a lot of other topics.  You know, we did counterfeit medicine in China.  We went over there and posed as a businessman trying to import counterfeit medicine.  And, you know, that was pretty eye-opening.  And so, you know, we're looking to apply this to a lot of different areas.  But we'll continue to keep an eye on this. 
[03:09:30]  And this is a story that's not going away anytime soon.  You guys are, like, jeopardy in a way.  Like, they travel to different locations.  Like, tune in next week when Dateline hits Hawaii.  You know, you should come out, like, wearing, like, something from each state.  Like, if you're in New Orleans, you have beads.  Or if you're in Hawaii, you have a wacky shirt.  But I think this is great.  You guys, I mean, entertainment, voyeuristic, yeah.  But you know what?  You're catching pedophiles.  Well, I think at the end of the day, you know, we're doing some good.  And as I said before, you know, we've created a situation where people are paying attention. 
[03:10:00]  I think two or three years ago, if a school district had an Internet Safety Awareness Night,  you know, you'd get a dozen or half a dozen folks, and they'd be the most dedicated PTA, you know, members.  I think today, you know, a lot of these meetings, we're told at least, are, you know, standing remotely and people are talking about it.  Do you find it odd ethically that, I mean, you've always heard to report the story and not become part of it, 
[03:10:30]  that you've become part of the story and between just catching these people and the video and audio being used in the court,  that you've actually become part of the story?  Well, I mean, you know, is it something I pay attention to?  Yes, of course.  Is it something that where I think I've crossed the line?  No.  I think at the end of the day, this is the very same, you know, technology and the very same investigative methods that we used in India  to expose, you know, child slave labor in the silk business, you know, in clothing that ends up on Fifth Avenue, 
[03:11:00]  or in Cambodia to expose sex tourism and, you know, kids as young as five, six years old being caught up in that whole thing.  Or, you know, the working editions in Bangladesh were close to end up in major department stores.  And we just turned this to the subject of computer predators.  And, yeah, did it get a lot of attention?  Sure.  You guys ever get a good laugh?  I know it's a serious subject.  We all know that.  It's a very serious subject. 
[03:11:30]  I mean, you're intense.  Sorry, go ahead, Chris.  Yeah, it's very intense, and everybody's, you know, harshing their throat when they get one of these things started.  But, yeah, undeniably, there are humors moments.  You just can't deny that.  Yeah, because you're a human being.  Right.  After the tape stops rolling, you guys have to be roaring every once in a while.  Well, you know, it's more like disbelief.  I mean, for instance, we had this guy in Florida show up, you know, to meet a 14-year-old boy,  this guy who brought along his five-year-old son. 
[03:12:00]  Right.  I mean, there was just an audible gasp in the house.  And when he left, and these guys I work with, I mean, we have probably 20-some people in this house,  producers, associate producers, all the hidden camera guys, all the stuff.  And these guys have traveled around the world with me and seen it all and done it all.  And some of these guys were actually in tears.  So it does.  It swings both ways.  I mean, it's just some sad moments and certainly some humorous ones.  Yeah, whatever happened to that guy, a lot of people are asking. 
[03:12:30]  He's being prosecuted in Florida.  He's being investigated by Child Welfare Services.  And he's pleaded not guilty, and his case is continuing through the legal system.  Pleaded not guilty.  Then for every tear that shed, you get to laugh at big, muscular, crying guy.  Yeah.  Who just, the guy that's like, oh, boy, oh, no, he's crying.  Oh, Jesus.  Any of these guys go after you physically?  You know, in the case outside of Washington, D.C., the rabbi who was recently convicted made kind of a physical move towards me. 
[03:13:00]  But I don't think I was in danger.  And it was suggested once that by one guy in California he was going to shove the camera someplace.  And I suggested that probably wasn't the best idea he's ever had.  It's probably good to go after people that kind of want to keep themselves on the QT a little bit so they're not out there going, you know, hey, I got a death threat against Chris Hansen.  Yeah.  Why?  Why do you, sir?  And can we see your computer hard drive, please? 
[03:13:30]  Right, exactly.  Most of the time, you know, we've had a couple of cases where people talked about, you know, how they carry guns or one thing or another.  And, you know, we always kind of err, if we are going to err on the side of caution there.  And when that's happened, you know, we'll just let the police do their thing.  Hey, I want to get Peter on the line here from Massachusetts.  Peter, you're on with Chris Hansen.  Good morning.  Chris, I just want to let you know your show came on at a time when we have a daughter who's 13.  And she was struggling with my space, but we were struggling with her about it. 
[03:14:00]  And we sat down together and watched her show, and it really opened her eyes as well as our eyes as to what really goes on out there.  And I wanted to say thank you for what you do.  Well, I appreciate it.  You know, as I was saying before, it's always kind of a struggle for us to balance, you know, what's okay for kids to see,  even when their parents are there, to put it in perspective with, you know, showing, you know, the graphic nature of what goes on, you know, in some of these chat rooms.  So, you know, we worked pretty hard to not go overboard and offend people, but to get people's attention at the same time. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, because I think what she actually saw and what these people were saying and the chat that you were describing,  I mean, I remember what she said.  It's like, this is gross.  I had no idea.  This is gross.  I don't want to go on there anymore.  So it was great.  Cool.  All right, Peter.  Nothing better than hearing Chris say something to the people that come in.  And, you know, you say you're here to have some fun and maybe just talk, but you're here for sex.  The way you say, you came here for sex, has us roaring on a weekly basis, by the way, Chris. 
[03:15:00]  That's a pretty good invitation.  It's wonderful because I've done it a thousand times.  I've used it in a bedroom with my girlfriend.  Hi, honey.  I'm here for sex.  Hi, Chris.  This is Frank.  I have a question for you.  Is it like, are they arresting people just for having saucy conversations?  No.  They've got to actually, you know, get involved in a conversation and then the solicitation has to occur. 
[03:15:30]  And then they actually, in most cases, have to actually travel and show up.  It's amazing how technology is always used for bad as well as good.  Good point, Frank.  Well, it is.  I mean, you know, the experts tell us that the access and the anonymity that the Internet provides, you know, fuels some of this activity for some of these men.  Yeah.  Well, you guys are doing a bang-up job, man. 
[03:16:00]  Excellent, man.  Really great.  Just doing a good job getting these guys.  And it is very entertaining to watch.  That might seem odd to you as a news guy, but, you know, I'm sure that's part of what you want.  You want people watching.  It is very entertaining to watch.  You ever get women going after the little boys?  We've not seen that.  Have you tried, though, just for a little twist on the show?  Well, you know, I think, you know, there are decoys who are both boys and girls out there in these chat rooms acting as boys or girls.  In two instances, we had somebody we were communicating with who identified themselves as a woman but, you know, never showed up. 
[03:16:30]  And we really never confirmed that, in fact, it was a woman.  What the experts say is that when it comes to female predators, you're more likely to see, you know, the teacher-student situation.  Absolutely.  Or more of a relationship, maybe.  Something that's more intimate or where they know the so-called victim and that when it comes to this anonymous-type situation, that it's more of a male-dominated crime. 
[03:17:00]  How much would you love to see Chris Hansen walk out and go,  I'm not the gym teacher.  I'm here because I know you're here for soon.  And the woman walks out.  But it seems like the woman, like, what's her name?  God, how could I forget her name?  Debra.  Debra LaFave.  Debra LaFave.  LaFave.  What do you think about that?  I mean, walking away, getting all the interview shows, obviously a beautiful woman. 
[03:17:30]  But what she did, in essence, was the exact same thing that these guys are doing.  And she walked and she's getting attention.  She's on a lot of these TV shows and people really aren't disgusted with her.  Well, you know, it's a unique situation.  I think it was reflected, you know, when Matt Lauer did his exclusive interview with her, you know.  Yeah, the Queen of England isn't interviewed in such a lovely, gentle setting as he talked to her.  Well, but he posed the tough questions.  I mean, he, you know, got to the bottom of it with her. 
[03:18:00]  But I think, you know, society views it differently.  Should it be viewed differently?  No.  Definitely does, though, yeah.  But, you know, even in these cases that we've seen, I mean, we've seen a wide range in sentencing.  I mean, there was a guy who was caught in Ohio who pleaded guilty right away and got, you know, 67 days in time served.  Well, that's interesting.  Yeah, the sentencing.  How different is it between them?  And what distinguishes the differences in the sentencing?  Because it is the same thing they're doing.  Right.  Is it wealth?  Is it their looks? 
[03:18:30]  Is it...  I don't think it's their wealth or looks.  I mean, obviously, if you're wealthy, you can get yourself a better defense attorney.  And that provides you, in some cases, a better defense.  But, you know, it has to do with the differences in sentencing guidelines state to state, whether or not these cases are prosecuted federally.  The rabbi, for instance, outside of Washington, D.C., was just recently convicted in a bench trial by a federal judge in Virginia.  He now faces a mandatory minimum five years and could go 30.  Because sometimes you see a guy walk in and you go, wow, that could be, you know, the businessman that's working in the cubicle next to you or something like that. 
[03:19:00]  But then there's the guy that walks in and you go, uh-oh, creepy pedophile guy.  I mean, we've had those guys obviously come in and you can sense, wow, you know.  But the other interesting thing, I think, is that in the vast majority of these cases, these are not guys who are registered sex offenders.  These are not guys who have been convicted of crimes like this before.  You know, we get a handful and we've had a couple, you know, serious ones.  But for the vast majority of times, these guys don't have criminal backgrounds. 
[03:19:30]  Anyone show up and they really were there for something else?  Like all of a sudden the pizza guy's there or something?  You know, fix the plumbing, for God's sake.  I kind of called it, you had leaky pipes.  I don't know what you're talking about.  We had a situation in Georgia where two women showed up at this house.  And, you know, we didn't have any conversation with any women that we were aware of.  And so we were quite sure what's going on.  And so everybody got in a position and they're kind of roaming around the property.  And it was kind of, you know, a rural property. 
[03:20:00]  And we couldn't figure out what was going on.  And so they'd knock on the door and, you know, we waited to see what they would say or do.  And they never really came in the house.  And suddenly they were leaving and the police stopped them.  And it turned out it was the owner of the house's daughter who had come by with a friend looking for, you know, some of her property.  And obviously that had nothing to do with our investigation, you know.  Yeah.  What do you think of the imitators?  There's a few out there now that I guess they saw the popularity.  And they seem to sensationalize it a little bit more. 
[03:20:30]  I haven't seen them.  I mean, I know, I guess one of the other networks has one where they follow the police doing things like this.  And, you know, I mean, everybody, you know, has the opportunity to do what they want to do.  I've just not seen them.  All right.  I guess that's about it.  Thank you very much.  What's the big plug there, Chris?  The big plug is that we continue Friday night at 9.  Okay.  Going to watch.  Thanks, Chris.  All right, guys. 
[03:21:00]  Thanks for having me on.  I appreciate it.  Keep it up, man.  All right.  Yeah, right on.  Chris Hansen, everyone.  There goes Chris Hansen.  That was interesting.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, definitely.  Gives a little insight on the whole show.  The show's very popular.  Yeah, like that's a good interview because he knows how to talk.  He's not going to, you know.  Yeah.  Some guys you talk to, you're like, ah.  He even, like, he even answered Frank the Frowner's question as if it was anybody else.  I think Frank had a couple of legitimate questions.  Yes, there are the bad things that happen to good people.  I wanted to know if I could be arrested for having a salty conversation. 
[03:21:30]  No, no.  It has to be done in a fashion that he answered Frank the Frowner as if it was a regular guy.  I was talking to a gal one time, and we were having a conversation that was peppered with salty language.  I can't ask.  It was peppered with salty language.  Oh, God, man. 
[03:22:00]  All right.  We should take a break.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Well, we got the latest one.  We can even check out some audio.  Let's check out some audio, man.  All right.  We can do that.  I don't want to wear myself in today, but do you know that I was molested when I was a child?  Oh, that's a shame.  I was lured into a van.  A van told me, hello.  I'm Dr. Smile Fixer.  So, of course, you're going to go.  Come to my van, and you'll be a smiling boy in no time. 
[03:22:30]  Very cruel of you.  I was not a smiling boy.  I'm picking on your picture.  I was crying with stitches in my backside.  All right.  You know, it takes more muscles to frown than it does to push a 35-year-old man off your back.  God damn it.  I'm going to break.  That's the line of the day, motherfucker.  There's a virus spreading in our area.  Will it affect you? 
[03:23:00]  Find out on the next Opie and Anthony show.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  I don't really have the virus yet.  I'm kind of itchy and stuff, but I don't really have the virus.  It's that virus you're always talking about.  The virus, the Opie, and Anthony. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah?  Is he on call?  All right.  Oh, cool.  Hello, fly.  Calling in tomorrow.  Very nice.  Hello, fly.  Motherfucker, blow fly.  Thank you to not use that kind of language.  I heard you ask for a blow fly from an underage girl.  Is that some type of slant?  I'm going to navigate this to all my friggin' friends out there who love heads. 
[03:24:00]  Woo!  Woo!  I know there's a whole bunch of them out there who love heads.  To the red, so you might well be dead if you refuse them heads.  So listen.  So listen.  Child, I've been digging you.  Can you show it when you find, girl?  Tell me, run.  But that's something I'd like to do to you.  Yay!  More than anything else in this world.

I did  Hi  Hi  Say it  I was at the Family Values tour on Sunday  At Nissan Pavilion  And walking to the bathroom  There was this little teeny tiny midget  She could have only been maybe  Three, three and a half feet tall 
[03:34:00]  It was hilarious  Where was it?  At the Family Values tour  Oh  At Nissan Pavilion  Yeah  What was she wearing?  A little midget in that crowd  She just had jeans and a t-shirt on  But she was as round as could be  Big fat little midget?  Yes  You'd think you'd be in like the optimum shape  You could possibly be in if you're a midget  Maybe that is  Maybe midget DNA doesn't work the same  The more you lift  The more your stomach juts out  As if God didn't destroy you enough 
[03:34:30]  The more push-ups you do  The bigger your head gets  Poor little fella  Just trying to work out  And he's wrecking everything  Oh  Did she  Was she trying to make  The heavy metal  Pinky finger  With those hands  That just could not possibly do that?  Yeah  The devil horns  The devil horns  No  She's trying to make the devil horns  It looked like a muffin  With two peanuts sticking out of it  Her little fucking rotten fingers  Two fat fleshy peanuts  Sticking out of a flesh muffin 
[03:35:00]  Party  Party  Why don't you fucking  Party in a car with a hose  Attached to a fucking  Exhaust pipe  Why don't you jump up and down the seat  And bang your little head on the roof  Anything else you could tell us  About this midget sighting, Wendy?  No  It was just  It was hilarious  And I was just  Laughing my ass off  Was she dancing or moshing  Or anything?  No  She was making her way to the bathroom  Oh  What would she be dancing to?  She was probably hoping  Cornwood's saying  It's a small world 
[03:35:30]  So she could  Here's how midgets dance  They clap their little muffin hands  And run in a circle  That's a midget dance  Sing it  They just clap and make a noise  And run in circles  Were her feet sticking straight out  From the toilet  When she was sitting down?  I didn't go in after her  You think it's open?  Somebody lock the door  From the outside  Hey someone's in here  Knock it off  What the hell?  I don't see any feet  And then they bang on the door  Little legs straight out  Duty fucking 
[03:36:00]  Just dropy straight in  They hop off  Their asshole  Scrapes the side of the bowl  That's one of those ways  They shit stay in the toilet  Because one of those fucking  Twerps jumps off  And rubs their rotten midget  Crack on it  Before they wipe it  Laughing  I have to go to the bathroom  Hey someone's in here  Are ya?  And then he went  Fucking knock anymore  They shouldn't even let  Midgets use stalls  You should be forced  To sit on a garbage can  Under the sink  And do your business  He was a cat box 
[03:36:30]  Yeah  A little cat box  Put a cat box out  For the midget in your house  You should be forced  To get into a cat box  And do your business  Laughing  Alright Wendy  Okay  Meanwhile  Back at the show  Steve in Texas  What's up?

[03:46:30]  I looked at the website  And I think that  All of these websites  Are really objectionable  And I don't  I certainly don't ascribe  To this kind of thinking  And I know that  Majority of American Muslims  Would not support  Something like this  Quest for Bush  Appears in English  French and Arabic  With militant jihadist songs  Playing in the background  We need to delink terrorism  The word terrorism  From Islam  Because Islam is a religion  That 1.2 billion people  In the world  Practice  Shut up  And the majority of us  Are just people  Who are practicing the faith  Practice  You're not good at it 
[03:47:00]  Unless you're killing people  With names like  Jihad Beginning  Americans Hell  And Bush  Hunted like a rat  The world wide web  Now allows us  To vent our frustration  And our anger  In all kinds of ways  So I think that  We have to be a little alarmed  And make sure  That this does not  Get promoted worldwide  The Secret Service says  They're taking a look  At the website  But under current  U.S. law  There's very little  They can do to stop it  Of course  It's the dumbest thing  It looks like  An old version of Doom  Horrible 
[03:47:30]  It's bad  Like  Bad graphics  And you know  Believe me  I am the last person  To support  Any of this bullshit  But  You ever see  Some of the video games  You can buy  In our stores  Not free downloads  I mean  I was playing one  Where I took  An A-10 warthog  And pretty much  Laid waste to Iraq  All by myself  It's great  You blow up  Everything  So it's like  If these guys  Want to put out  A stupid free video game 
[03:48:00]  You can download  Off a website  You'll never find  Anyway  Where are these  Extremist jihad websites  I want to go there  I want to see  What they're using  MySpace.com  Jim Norton  Is that what it is  You can get all the games  Eatabullet.com  They're just bringing  Attention to these games  By talking about them  No one would have  Known about these games  No one would know  Who the hell  Would know about that one  And  Noob  There's so much violence  In video games  I've created  A new video game  Oh you did  That's going to be fun 
[03:48:30]  For the kids  Yeah  Stop  And  Won't have any violence  In it  It's called  Color shirts  Oh  And the goal  Is that  You have a whole  Bunch of people  And  All the people  Who are wearing  Blue shirts  You have to somehow  Hustle them  Behind a partition  And they have to  Change into red  And yellow shirts  And then by the end  Of the game  Whoever has  The most yellow 
[03:49:00]  Or red  Or blue shirts  Wins  And even the losers  Get the same prize  As the winners  Everyone gets cookies  It's a wonderful game  Hey Kevin in Louisiana  What's up  Hold on  I didn't tell you the twist  No Kevin  They don't have  His shoes on  Hey you know what  Shut up  You need to be  You need to be  Nice lately man  You've been an asshole  Lately  I want to know  What the fuck  Is wrong with you lately  Hold on  I'm explaining the twist  In my video game  Because the blue  And the red  And the yellow shirts 
[03:49:30]  You need to  Stop being an asshole  I can't hear you sir  I can't hear you sir  Sir you're not  It's hard to hear you  Jimmy's been very nice lately  Of course he has  Extremely nice  The different colored shirts  What happens is  The players  They don't have feet  They each walk  With their stumps  Inside of aborted fetuses  And they make  Squishy sounds  And they walk  And they change  Swiggy  Help us out  To a blue shirt  Or a red shirt  Now that game 
[03:50:00]  Hey guys  What's going on  What's up Swiggy  I want to play  What I learned today  Oh cool  Thank you  Anthony lost his virginity  By a kerosene lamp  Did you  You did  Might want to invest  In sinus surgery  No  There was electricity  Then in that place  Ah my bad  It was a different place  We moved every year  Believe me  Let's go to Indy Mike  Anthony lost his virginity  To a Civil War chess piece  Indy Mike  Yes sir  What did I learn today  I learned that  Howie did not invent  Time travel  Yeah that 
[03:50:30]  That was a good  Discussion there earlier  Oh yes  On the old time travel thing  Can't wait to have it again  When I pop back  In time  Good luck  With the commute home today  By the way  Good luck  I got a route  That was given to me  By police officers  So I know  Which way to go  Call me at noon  I know you  I know you're not  Getting home before noon  Just a hole  From West Virginia  What's up  Can I get an escort  Police escort  Well I just wanted to say  That it doesn't  Quest for Bush 
[03:51:00]  Means something  Totally different  To American men  Ah  You mean like  A pussy  No landscape  You mean like  A Stewie  That was a good one. 
[03:51:30]  Sorry, I thought it was funny.  Did you?  Marty in Indiana, yes.  Hey, I learned today that Chuck Liddell is one bad motherfucker. 
[03:52:00]  Someone suggested, can you imagine Dateline?  And instead of meeting Chris Hansen from the back room, it's Chuck.  Chuck comes out and just like...  You get a choice.  You could either go outside and meet the police,  or you can take the back way out.  But it's through Chuck Liddell.  They're going to have to spice the show up after a while  and give him like a challenge.  You would have to take the Chuck option. 
[03:52:30]  You got to take the Chuck option.  You would have to take the Chuck...  But there's no tapping out.  Like, what is he just...  He beats you until you're unconscious and then...  And then they drag you off to jail.  Anyway?  Where you get butt raped.  I thought you were able to get away.  Anyway, the trick is no one gets away.  No, no, no, no.  You have to get past him.  Oh, oh, oh, I see.  If you get past him...  And what is he, in a doorway?  Yeah.  Oh.  So you can't get like past him by doing some kind of weird football roll move.  Or you just take him on in the kitchen. 
[03:53:00]  So if you kick Chuck Liddell's ass, you're able to leave?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Or you can just walk out into cuffs.  Would you take that shit?  How many people?  You would have to take that shit.  You would have to take the Liddell challenge.  Yeah, beats you on a jail.  And the humiliation.  But you're going to go to jail beat up because you're not getting past Chuck.  Hospital.  Jail.  Yeah, but you're still going to jail.  Let's go to...  Wow, that's a tough one.  Sonny Ferrelli.  Hey, I fucking learned, fucking, that Master Post sucks as bad as I do on the radio. 
[03:53:30]  Oh.  Uh, Dave in Ohio.  Fucking a couple more times.  Yeah, I learned today if you eat a bunch of almonds, you'll shit like a nigger.  I didn't say that.  Say that, you racist.  Say that, Kevin.  I said salted cashews.  Kevin.  Oh, wait.  Yeah.  Wait, wrong correction.  I love the name of your town.  It's so much fun to say.  Conorette.  What's up, guys?  Conorette.  That's...  Conorette, yeah.  That's that little place next to Carter. 
[03:54:00]  Hurry up.  Excuse me, sir.  Hold.  I don't know what that sound means.  Okay, continue.  What's that sound mean?  It's a car crash.  That's not what happens when you choke bombs.  What happens?  What do I have to do?  You have to pull your pants down.  I have to.  It's on a different sheet.  By the way, can I ask, Kev, real quick, who did you interview?  So we know who to look over to.  I'm asking a big Kev question.  Um, uh, Yvonne Craig, David Naughton, and the Iron Sheik, and possibly Lori Petty, but 
[03:54:30]  I don't know if the audio is good or not.  Okay.  David Naughton.  All right.  Are you ready for the, uh, line of the day?  I'm scared.  We got a runner-up line of the day?  And then the actual line of the day.  Runner-up?  I believe Jimmy had both, right?  Wait, they have a, you have a, a sweeper?  For the winner.  An intro?  Oh, for the winner.  I kind of liked when we made up our own intros for the line of the day thing.  Yeah, this song, we have to have a song.  Here's the song. 
[03:55:00]  Line of the daytime!  Line of the daytime!  Line of the daytime!  He's here!  Is the runner-up.  That's how they make you feel better about your ailment, is they send her over, and you're  like, all right, well, I may always look surprised, and I may have no lashes, and I wince when  I see vinegar, but at least I don't sound like this idiot.  Of course, the burn victim talking about the deaf reporter.  Wincing at the vinegar.  God damn, I love that we do line of the day now, because I forgot all about that. 
[03:55:30]  It seemed like it happened yesterday.  Doesn't it?  We did that at like 6.30 this morning.  We've been talking since 6.  I know.  Anyone else realize how ridiculous this is?  All right, here is line of the day with the intro or sweeper or the setup, whatever.  Here comes the line of the day!  Line of the day!  Do you know it takes more muscles to frown than it does to push a 35-year-old man off 
[03:56:00]  your back?  We're back live.  Wow.  You pulled that out of your ass 15 minutes ago.  That's a great line.  He got the runner-up, the winner, and he's the sweeper.  Right.  Wow, Jimmy.  Not too self-serving.  Jesus.  Why the day?  I write good jingles.  Everybody hates on the game, but I'm a jingle writer. 
[03:56:30]  That's a good jingle.  Jokes and jingles.  You've got to give him that.  All right.  I guess that's how we end today.  That's my thing, folks out there.  You need a jingle, I'll write it for you.  Sing it.  What is this one?  Oh, Mike in Baltimore.  Mike.  I learned that you can't get in trouble with a young person.  If it's not online, it's frappled with salty language.  I didn't know the beginning of what he said, but that sounded very good as a Frank. 
[03:57:00]  You can hang up now.  Oh, punch out for you.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Do you know one time I was having a conversation, and the girl got mad at me because I began  throwing about frisked insinuations.  All right.  That's it.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right.  Bye.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[03:57:30]  Yes, we will.  Thank you, everybody.  I'll talk hello, and good night.  Next time on a very special Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray goes to the doctor.  Ray, would you like to see your test results?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  What are you doing?  Ray.  No.  I'm afraid you've got AIDS.  No.  Come on.  You have a rare strain of HIV.  No.  Commonly found in post-op Portuguese transsexuals.  No.  The fun really begins when Ray's wife finds out. 
[03:58:00]  Why is the toilet filled with bloody poo?  God.  Oh, my God.  The bed is full of scabs.  It's hot.  But everything works out in the end.  Sweetie, you're losing so much weight.  I bought you a smaller robe.  Ray, your mother's here.  She wants to say goodbye.  Oh, what are you doing?  All on the next Everybody Loves Raymond.  Tonight at 8.  One more gather.  Today.  Have fun.  Thank you.  See you.  Bye. 
[03:58:30]  Bye.  Weise. </pre>
