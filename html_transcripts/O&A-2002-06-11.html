<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with advertisements for Jarrett Dodge, followed by a call from race car driver Joe McCarthy promoting Trim Spa diet pills.  More commercials aired for Payroll Data and Mujan hair removal strips, the latter accompanied by exaggerated sound effects of hair removal.  After a brief, somber discussion of John Gotti's death, with Anthony offering condolences to his family, most of the staff left the studio.

Opie arrived late, blaming errands.  The hosts discussed their recent time off, including a "hangover show" in Reno, and recounted a raucous encounter with a stripper in Boston who engaged in various sexual acts with the production team and guests.  They then shifted to a segment on a police dog possibly engaging in racial profiling, before launching into a discussion of their upcoming "staple gun roulette" contest for a WWE trip. Numerous callers expressed their eagerness to participate. The show briefly touched on updates about "Stalker Patty" and a "wow contest" for women with a $5,000 prize, and concluded this section with speculation about Paul McCartney's remarriage and his children's potential reactions.

Brother Joe's parody song about Paul McCartney marrying a one-legged woman followed, containing humorous and crude lyrics about the challenges of their relationship.  This led to a discussion of the staple gun contest, prompting a tense negotiation with Super GM Ken Stevens, who initially refused to approve the contest unless Opie and Anthony stapled themselves first.  A call from someone claiming to be John Lennon (from beyond the grave) offered tangential support for Paul McCartneyâ€™s remarriage and suggested a titanium ankle.

Opie and Anthony ultimately decided to staple themselves through multiple layers of newspaper, removing a page after each staple.  This resulted in a prolonged, painful competition, escalating in intensity as they reached the skin, leading to bleeding. Anthony conceded defeat due to the pain, leaving Opie as the winner. The segment ended with the hosts emphasizing their pain and the need for medical attention, interspersed with banter, commercial breaks, and continued negotiations with Ken Stevens.

The show resumed with listeners reacting to the staple gun stunt.  Callers shared their experiences, with one recounting a similar prison experience and another expressing amusement. A female caller revealed being aroused by the hosts' pain, and proceeded to detail her lesbian relationship with her best friend. A male caller described a car with Arabic writing and a "I'd rather be flying my Cessna" license plate frame.  The conversation then shifted back to "Stalker Patty," recounting her history with the show, including wig removal and humiliation.  They detailed her confrontation with a saleswoman, Judy, in a gym locker room, where Patty read a letter detailing her current living situation in a women's shelter and expressing her continued love for the show, while making requests for future segments. Judy recounted Patty's actions, further highlighting the awkwardness of the situation.  Callers offered varied opinions on Patty and the hosts' treatment of her, touching upon her craving for attention and abuse.  The segment ended with a discussion about online chatting in the late 90s and a listener impersonating a sexually suggestive online persona, followed by brief reminiscences about early webcam models.

A subsequent segment focused on internet pornography, its evolution, and the use of ad-blocking software. The hosts discussed "Lady Di," a regular caller, whose continued participation depended on a listener-approved stunt.  Ideas were debated, including serenading Jim Norton and eating pudding from a plaster cast of a buttock.  Actor Sam Levine appeared as a guest, followed by two "Mistresses," who engaged in a sexually suggestive on-air discussion and demonstration using code words for body parts, culminating in playfully torturing a show employee, John, with duct tape and a whip.  Numerous commercials interrupted this segment.

This segment featured a prolonged and graphic scenario with the two dominatrixes tying up and torturing John using duct tape, shoelaces, and ropes. The hosts actively encouraged the acts, providing explicit descriptions.  The show featured numerous advertisements, including Mercedes-Benz, Comcast, and others.  Ron and Fez joined the show in the studio, taking over John, who remained bound and gagged, from the dominatrixes and Sam Levine, who thanked the hosts as the segment concluded.

[00:03:30]  And the choir tastes like roadkill.  Uh-oh, I hope we have a lot of delay for this commercial.  Anthony?  Yes.  Mujan.  Mujan.  You want to explain to George the Puppet what Mujan is?  Mujan is a wonderful way for women to get rid of unwanted body hair.  Bikini line, legs, even mustaches, facial hair that girls might have.  And it's so much better than shaving.  Nipple hair, whatever it is. 
[00:04:00]  It leaves the body very smooth.  Mujan.  Is that like electrolysis?  No, it's a strip that comes in a package of the Mujan 2000.  You press it on and peel it off and completely smooth.  Wonderful, smooth, sexy skin.  The name is smooth.  It's basically yanking tubic hairs out.  But, look.  Mujan.  Should be called...  Ah!  Oh!  You know, we just spoke at the people from Mujan. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  We had a demonstration in our office.  It is quick, painful, and completely removes hair.  Do you have a hairy knish?  Try Mujan.  Here's you.  Ah!  I hope the bastard appreciates this.  Yanking my t*** hairs out by the roof.  So I look good in a sundress.  Ugh.  Ah!  It should be called... 
[00:05:00]  Ah!  Oh, sorry.  Yankee?  Wait, wait.  That line has to be on the radio.  Oh, it's great.  Thank you.  It's easy.  Peel, press it off.  Press it on and pull it off.  Unwanted hair.

It's slow to grow back.  Lighter, thinner.  Skin is softer, sexier than before.  Mujan. 
[00:05:30]  It's wonderful.  You always throw that aloe in there.  There's aloe in there.  What is that?  I'm bleeding.  I'm taking you to a hospital.  There's aloe in there.  There'll be no blood from Mujan.  It's wonderful.  It's so gentle.  We saw a demonstration.  The hair comes off.  You don't even feel it.  I know it's biting at this point.  It's the most desirable way to remove hair.  You know what else is good?  Closing a storm window on your testicle is also good. 
[00:06:00]  You know, for the hot weather?  All right.  Just drop a storm window on your T-bag.  There's aloe in that window.  You want some aloe for your testicle?  Mujan, the most comfortable way to remove hair at home.  Why pay those salon prices?  Mujan removes hair completely.  It's available at Duane Reade, Harmon Cosmetics, Genovese Drugs, and Cosmetics Plus.

After she, you know, waxed her hair.  Okay.  Let's hear it.  It's so smooth.  She's so sexy.  She doesn't even need a brain anymore.  It's amazing. 
[00:07:00]  So to get hair off of that,  No one even heard this spot, but it's hilarious.  I don't even give a crap.  Ten people on hold are enjoying this.  Yeah, they hear the unedited version.  Oh, yeah.  Not anymore, Otto.  There's aloe in there.  Thanks for asking ahead of time.  You get hit by a truck that's carrying aloe.  Does it still hurt?  Ponder that one for a while. 
[00:07:30]  Mujan.  The best way to remove that unwanted body hair.  All right.  Ask for it at a cosmetics store near you.  That was funny.  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:08:00]  Finally back.  Back in New York City.  I feel like I've been gone forever.  We have been gone a long time.  Yeah.  I left Friday.  Right after the show.  Friday night after the show.  So, yeah.  It's been a long party and weekend.  All right.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027. 
[00:08:30]  Anywhere else, including...  Yes.  Reno.  Reno.  We are on in Reno.  We're on in Reno, Nevada.  I guess we started in Reno yesterday, Anthony.  We're on the Hawk.  Nice.  92.9.  The Hawk.  Classic rock.  That really rocks.  92.9.  The Hawk.  The Hawk.  The Hawk.  While all the other stations are being pussies,  we rock on the Hawk. 
[00:09:00]  With classic rock that really rocks.  Reno.  Reno.  Yeah.  Hi, Reno.  That's good.  God.  I enjoy Reno.  We started in Reno yesterday, I guess.  Yeah?  They had to hear one of those hangover shows.  From...  That New York is very used to at this point.  Yeah, New York's pretty used to the hangover shows.  So, we'll try to do a better job today, Reno.  We'll do better next time.  So, if you're outside of the New York area,  and you're in Reno or somewhere else, 
[00:09:30]  give us a call.  866-2774-WOW.  We'd love to hear from you, okay?  Yes.  All right.  Beautiful Reno.  What's going on, Anthony?  Well, I know we don't really want to talk about this or anything.  Some people are a little frightened, I think.  But I just want to, you know,  my condolences to the Gotti family.  As an Italian, I just want to say, you know,  my condolences.  That's all.  Where are you going?  I'm going to go get some coffee.  I'm just saying, you know, 
[00:10:00]  regardless of how you felt about the man,  he had his principles and ideas,  and he did very well for his name.  Why is everybody leaving the studio?  Why is everyone leaving the studio?  I'm alone here.  Look, I just wanted to say  that he did have his ideas,  and a lot of people,  I kind of looked at him  and didn't feel he was an upstanding citizen, 
[00:10:30]  but he did take care of his neighborhood  and his community.  And for that, I just want to, you know,  my condolences to the Gotti family.  Yeah, I feel weird.  I'm in here all along.  Everyone left the studio.  It's an Italian thing.  What can I tell you?  All right, I'm done.  Just, you know,  rest in peace, Dapper Don. 
[00:11:00]  And, you know, people out there in your hometown,  you know, miss you.  Hello?  If you come back now,  I'm done.  I'm done.  We don't believe you're really done yet.  No, I swear, I'm done.  And, you know,  all throughout the 80s,  we remember seeing on the news  John Gotti  and, you know, 
[00:11:30]  all the court cases  and  they've left me alone here.  Just wanted to bring up the fact that  he, you know,  he did help a lot of people out  and if a couple of people got hurt,  I believe,  you know,  maybe they should have,  maybe they should have steered clear.  You know,  people that are in the business.  But as far as the civilians go,  I think, 
[00:12:00]  I think he secured the neighborhood very well.  Anthony,  we're going out for bagels.  Do you want one?  No, I'm done.  I was just saying  that  it was a different time  also,  you know.  It was a different time.  A man like  John Gotti  in today's world,  you know,  didn't really fit.  And I just think it's a shame  that he had to  he had to die in prison like that.  I just think 
[00:12:30]  for the day and age  that was  all throughout  that part of the 80s  and  he was  he was part of a  a city  part of a city  New York City  and  he did  he did his job  the way  the way  the way he was supposed  why  why is everybody leaving?  If anyone calls for me  just tell them I'm home early today, okay?  You're not even going to hang out  for the rest of the show?  Just because  as an Italian American 
[00:13:00]  I can respect  the man  for  for  how he  presented himself  even in  the  the job he was in.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all I'm saying.  It was a different time  a different place  and  I just want to say  Godspeed  John Gotti  that's all 
[00:13:30]  a banana  John Gotti  there you go  now I'll have an espresso  with a little  zambuca in it  can I get that?  if somebody  would please  come into the studio  and  I don't understand  why everyone's  scattered  Are we restarting  the show?

[00:25:30]  on the cop's belt  that releases the hound  So the dog comes out of the car  and a lot of commotion going on  the officer said  A lot of commotion  So the dog lunged  for a nine year old  black child  a boy  and grabbed him by the leg  and dragged him  twenty feet down the road  So now the dog's in trouble?  So now the dog is in trouble  and the cop is saying  look it was a very noisy  a lot of action going on  He wasn't even releasing the dog 
[00:26:00]  It got hit by the perp  or when he was rolling around  or something  and the dog  just sees a lot of action going on  and went for some movement  So the kid moved or anything  I think it would have happened  regardless of who was moving  You know you can't then say  this councilwoman  Wanda Jones Dixon  She's just going to screw it  for everybody  When you start getting  this ridiculous  No one's going to take  racial profiling serious  Seriously if you're starting  to do this crap 
[00:26:30]  You're saying the dog  is racially profiling people  says the dog  should be put to sleep  and the parents  and the child  showed up at this hearing  with the child limping  and I'm sure  a nice big fat juicy lawsuit  is awaiting  McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania  but they're saying  the dog should be put to sleep  and experts are saying  there's no way  because dogs are color blind  and they can't distinguish race  but the whole point of this  that I got was  we're getting silly 
[00:27:00]  with the racial profiling thing  we're really getting silly  with it  and this is going to  take away from  you know people  that maybe are being  racially profiled  I don't know  I'm from the school of thought  if Islamic people  and Arab people  are doing all the bombing  perhaps those are the people  we should look into  and if there is  racial profiling there  it's completely legit  and should be done  if you're just a couple  of homeboys  driving down the street  you know  and you're getting  pulled over for no reason 
[00:27:30]  that's bad racial profiling  but a dog  stop it  I just think  Wanda Jones Dixon  I wonder what her  ethnic background is  I'm thinking Jewish  Wanda Jones Dixon  is getting a little  carried away  wants to get her name  in the paper  it's a Jewish broad  some Jew broad  alright  racist dogs  so they haven't killed  a dog yet right  no no  he's sitting there  waiting on death row  Rick stop it  so we'll be eagerly 
[00:28:00]  awaiting the completion  of that story  alright  Anthony  yeah  a few other things  today  we'll have another  Lady Di update  as she tries to stay  on this radio show  she's only got a couple  of days left  she's got until Friday  goes down Friday  also Anthony  we have a WWE  trip to give away  to the next  pay per view thing  what's next  King of the Ring  or is it uh  where is the info  ah  it just says trip 
[00:28:30]  I forgot which one's next  whatever  you know the deal  King of the Ring  it is King of the Ring  yeah King of the Ring  alright we got a trip  for two to check out  WWE  King of the Ring  pay per view  and we're not just  going to be giving  these away right  no we came up  with a really good idea  we want to do  staple gun roulette  staple gun roulette  coming to the  Opie and Anthony show  give me that  staple gun roulette  you want to explain it  this is great 
[00:29:00]  we have our contestants  how many uh  how many figure  we'll get  five or six  five or six  all right  we will have  identical staplers  nah this is going to be  all different kinds  really  yeah to trick them  why not  because then we got to  change  once somebody gets  because isn't it  the last guy left  right  it's the last guy left  so if they're all the  same and you spin it  then they're not going  to know which one  okay I thought  first guy that uh  yeah  got the uh staple  wins 
[00:29:30]  no  that's the last guy  yeah  oh nice  that way everyone  yeah only the winner  walks away  because I was worried  that this stupid contest  would last two seconds  if the first guy  grabbed the right one  oh no  this is great  okay good  so we have  identical staplers  um  and uh  one of those  staplers  has  a full clip  of staples in it  the rest are empty  they will be uh  picking staplers  off the table  and putting them 
[00:30:00]  to their thigh  or any other  fleshy part of their being  pretty much the thigh  yeah the thigh  is where you can  really lay in there  and get some  pressure  and uh  click away  and whoever gets  hit with the staple  is out  you remove one  of the staplers  without staples in it  mix them around again  and uh  they go again  and the guy  that is left  unscathed  the one guy  that did not 
[00:30:30]  get a staple in him  gets to go to  king of the ring  yes winner receives  a trip for two  to see WWE's  king of the ring  in Columbus Ohio  on Sunday  June 23rd  courtesy of the WWE  trip includes  round trip airfare  and hotel accommodations  WWE's  king of the ring  only on pay-per-view  call your pay-per-view  provider to order now  and this goes down  what Thursday  Thursday yeah  so we're gonna have to  get some contestants  for this  yeah  who wants to  participate  who could take  the pain  uh oh  this just in  winner must be  from the New York

[00:31:30]  just used for  little tacking  jobs  and then  there are the  ones that  the cable guy  uses to staple  the cable to the  wall  you know  you need a lot  of staple  because that  cable takes up  a lot of room  the really long  yeah  the long ones  the little sharp  point at the end  so I'm thinking  we gotta go with  the biggies  you're insane  we gotta go with  the like the medium  you think  somewhere in between  medium  I don't want them  pussy little ones  that come out of  the desk stapler  type thing  no no 
[00:32:00]  we gotta have  staple gun  yeah that kind  ow  look at the  guys already  calling  we're one step  away from our  bee contest  yeah  we will make  that happen  we'll do the  bee contest  one of these  days for a  car  as soon as the  lawyers get off  their fat asses  and wake up and  help us out with  this radio show  well at least now  we're distracting  them with other  things they have to  pay attention to  obviously they're not

[00:43:30]  Yeah, we're back  with the Opie and Anthony show.  Executioners.  Going down.  We got a bunch of people  that want in on the  staple gun roulette game, Anthony.  I'll never understand this.  Let me go to Matt real fast.  Matt, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, Matt.  Hey, listen,  if you guys really want  to put a meaty clip  into somebody's thigh,  use a T-25.  That's what I work  for the phone company.  That's what we use 
[00:44:00]  to staple a ground wire  to the side of a house.  Well,  what are you saying?  We might as well  just get pneumatic nail guns.  Yeah, we don't want  to kill these guys.  Well, come on.  This is for wrestling tickets, right?  For a trip.  Well, even better, a trip.  It's a good trip, too.  It's all about the anticipation.  Yes.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  We don't want to, like,  really, really hurt them.  How many of these guys  are we going to get?  Doug.  Hey, Doug.  Hey, what's up?  Real fast.  What's up? 
[00:44:30]  Hey, listen.  As funny as it sounds,  there's a femoral artery  inside of your thigh,  so it'd be hilarious,  but they could bleed to death  all over your studio.  Dude.  You look cool.  We will have a doctor on site.  First of all,  do you know how far  into your leg that is?  It's next to the bone.  Well, if you're talking  about the staples  that, you know,  put the cables  on the side of your house,  I think it'd probably reach.  I don't think so.  You want to take the chance?  Look at the doctor over here.  Yeah, we're going to have 
[00:45:00]  a doctor that, you know,  kind of, I don't know,  ropes off the area  that we could use.  Put the pictures up.  We'll be fine.  All right, Matt.  We know what we're doing.  That gets broken with bullets  and when people fly  through windshields  and it cuts their leg  halfway off.  Not a staple.  Jeff from D.C.,  what's up?  Hey, I just wondered  if you guys were going to  have a little  Vee of the Me guy  in the background  yelling,  Dee Dee Mao  and slapping him around  when they did it.  Oh, that would be funny.  Wouldn't that be great  while he's, like,  thinking about stapling himself  the guy smacking him?  Mao! 
[00:45:30]  Mao!  Mao!  Mao!  Mao!  Do it, Nicky!  Do it!  Nicky, do it!  Show these mother...  Do it, Nicky!  Thank you, Jeff.  You're right.  You're welcome.  You guys rock.  All right, we're trying.  Hey, you want to get  the contestants now?  I shoot myself.  You want to get  the contestants now?  Yeah, we should.  We should.  I want to talk to a couple.  And when do you want  to do this contest?  We should do it right away  before the lawyers  have too much time  to think about things.  Good idea.  Can we do it tomorrow?  Do it tomorrow. 
[00:46:00]  Let's see if these guys  can come in tomorrow, all right?  Let's go right to the phones.  How many do we need?  Five, six?  Sean, what's up?  Hey, what's up, dude?  I want to do a contest.  You do, do you?  Yeah.  You know what's  going to happen, right?  Yeah, no problem.  And explain it again.  There's going to be  staplers laying out.  One stapler  is going to have  staples in it.  The big staple guns.  Yeah.  They're going to be  identical staplers  so no one will know  which one has  the staples in it.  And then we'll  give you one 
[00:46:30]  and the rest  of the contestants one.  Most of them  got no staples.  So when you  touch to your leg  and pull,  boink,  all right,  I'm still in.  But one guy  will always have  a live stapler.  And it might be you.  And if you're stapled,  you're out.  The guy that goes  on the trip  is the guy  that never gets stapled.  Fine by me.  All right.  Well, hold on the line,  okay?  All right.  Should we weed through  them live on the air 
[00:47:00]  or should we have  Stinky take care of this?  You can take a couple.  Just make sure they know  what's going on  and make sure they show up.  Hey, Tim,  what's going on?  Yo, what's going on, guys?  You in or what?  Yeah, I'm in.  You ever do anything  like this before?  Cigarette burnings?  Nails?  Thumbtacks?  Slash myself.  I work, you know,  I'm a crazy guy.  Let's do it.  Crazy guy.  All right.  Well, it's for a trip  for two to see  WWE's King of the Ring  in Columbus, Ohio  on Sunday, June 23rd.  I don't even care.  I'm in the studio  with you guys.  That's all I care about.  See how the guys are, Alpy? 
[00:47:30]  Do you see when we call out  to get guys in here  for a contest  what happens?  Yeah, we have this  wow thing that has started  and so far no ladies  have showed up  in New York  and it's a great,  great contest  and a great prize  on the line.  $5,000.  But we do a thing  for guys  and then they come  out of the woodwork.  We had a couple of fives  in the studio in Boston  as far as Earl's concerned.  Yeah, well, yeah,  a 10.  Took two fives  to get to the 10,  but Tim,  I think we want  to save the trip 
[00:48:00]  for someone  that really wants  to go see  the WWE thing, man.  Well, I like wrestling too  but I just want to do it.  I just got to be  in this contest.  All right, hold on the line.  All right, great.  Sounds like someone  that'll show.  Steve, you're next  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I'm going to show.  You'll show?  Yeah, of course I will.  Where are you from?  New York.  Well, obviously.  What part?  What's that?  Yeah, why am I asking?  Who cares?  All right, no fear.  No fear, Steve.  Hello?  Yeah, okay, goodbye.  All right, he's done.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys? 
[00:48:30]  I'm ready to go from work  to be down there  whenever you want.  Tomorrow?  Tomorrow.  I'll be there.  All right, and are you  a big wrestling fan?  Huge wrestling fan.  I drove up to  WrestleMania in Toronto.  And you can take pain?  Hell yeah, I can take pain.  All right, I like Mike.  Yeah, Mike, you're in.  Thanks.  Okay, let's go to John.  You want to get  a couple alternates  just in case?  How many do you want?  I think we need,  I don't know,  I think we get  like eight guys  in the contest.  Probably eight guys.  So we'll get a total of ten  if a couple people drop out 
[00:49:00]  then the alternates  will be in.  All right?  John, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Dude, I'm ready.  You ready to do this?  Hell yeah.  Take the pain.  Dude, I'm pierced all over.  I'm ready.  Is that an advantage, though?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  When you're talking  a staple into your thigh  like that,  well, he sounds good.  Okay, hold on, John.  Let's go to Pat.  Pat, you're next  on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  What's up?  Hello?  What's up?  Hey, it's Pat. 
[00:49:30]  I'm one in, guys.  You want in?  I'm one in.  Okay, hold on the line.  It's so easy  with the guys.  Let's have Rick  talk to these guys  because they're all  into it.  Get them to show up.  Yeah, we've got  a wow contest going on.  We want girls to come  down to the studio  and we'll take a picture.  You know how  these contests work.  Take a picture  of you wowing.  That doesn't mean  standing against a wall  and pulling your cans out.  You know, work it.  You can wear  as little as you want  and just come down. 
[00:50:00]  What's up for grabs?  $5,000.  From RisqueVideo.com.  Right.  R-I-S-Q-U-E  Video.com.  So what are you waiting for?  Do it.  Plus, you'll be a star.  You'll be a star  of this radio show.  You know how this works.  If you're from another city  that wins this thing,  we'll fly you into New York.  We'll show you off  a little bit.  We're going to have  some fun with this damn thing.  Look what's happened  to the Naughty Nighty  contest winner  down in D.C.  She's now doing  appearances and stuff  for WJFK. 
[00:50:30]  Out and about.  It's a great way  to get your name  on the map.  All right.  And so far,  no ladies have shown up  in New York.  No.  Should we do the thing?  We had four or five  ladies show up in Boston.  We don't have  the digital pictures up yet  because we left  the camera behind in Boston.  It will be here tomorrow.  Then we'll put them up  on our site,  opianthony.com.  All the rules of the contest  should be up  on opianthony.com.  Should we have an incentive  for the first girl  that shows up here  to get in this contest  in New York? 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, we could do that.  We have some kind  of a prize we can give  because we've got to beg  here in New York  for some reason.  Yeah, we could do that.  First lady that comes down here,  we'll give you  something nice, okay?  We'll give you  something cool.  And we promise  we won't make fun of you.  Yeah.  Well, Ben's not here today  and he's the one  that always starts  making fun of.  Ben's definitely  the troublemaker.  Yeah, we enjoy  the girls' company  down here.  It's Ben that gives  him the dirty looks.  It's horrid.  Anthony, your brother  has sent in a couple songs.  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:51:30]  Oh!  He's hard at work.  Hard at work  writing his songs.  Somehow I know  what these are about, too.  Well, Paul McCartney's  getting married.  Paul McCartney  getting married  and they're all,  oh, they're so happy  over there in England  about this whole thing.  Real big deal.  I guess the kids  aren't happy.  That old dad  wants to, you know,  have some happiness  in his life.  Move on and, uh...  I guess the kids  just want him  to mourn Linda  for the rest of his life.  What's the protocol there? 
[00:52:00]  You know?  I don't know.  That's an odd thing.  Because it's different  than breaking up  with somebody.  Yeah, think of it.  This girl now,  she's with Paul McCartney,  which is, you know,  that's pretty  financially rewarding  and whatnot.  The kids think  she's in it for the money.  Well, that would probably  be what a lot of people  think, because first of all,  Paul McCartney does nothing  but talk about  Linda McCartney now.  He's taken up  our goddamn clauses  on the vegetarianism  and the landmine things. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, I guess that chick  would have a 50%  less chance of stepping  on a landmine  than anyone else.  This girl.  If I think about it,  really.  But if somebody  breaks up with you  and you're remarried,  that's one thing.  If someone dies  and you get remarried,  that person,  it's just a goddamn  albatross  going to be around  your neck.  Because Paul's always,  oh, Linda was so  into this vegetarian  cause.  Maybe the one-legged  girl wants the meat. 
[00:53:00]  Maybe she wants  a steak.  But Paul is like,  you know,  he's taken up  all her causes.  He's still deeply  in love with  this dead woman.  Got to be a tough  nut to crack, man.  I don't know.  You're having sex  and you know,  he's just thinking  about how it was  with Linda.  Ah.  Well, he's happy  with the new one  and they're getting  married.  Yeah, he's happy  with the new one  but like I said,  that old one  is always in there  because he lost her  while he still  loved her a lot.  Right.  Kind of weird.  And she has one leg,  Anthony.  She's got one leg. 
[00:53:30]  So your sick brother  Joe thought it would  be fun to just  kind of sing a song  about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Al Mack from Clifton  wants to know  if it's to the  Patty Duke theme.  No, not this one.  No.  And I think  he's got two songs.  Yeah.  So let's listen  to the first one.  It's Brother Joe,  Paul McCartney,  getting married  to the one-legged broad.  Right.  Right.  Once you had two legs 
[00:54:00]  to walk back home with.  Once you had two legs  to walk back home.  Jeez, now you're falling  to one side.  I think we'd better  catch a ride. 
[00:54:30]  Bones and lumber  build your thighs.  I get splinters in my eyes.  Please, pretty darling,  when I'm uptight.  Would you remove  your wooden thigh?  Paul, you're gonna 
[00:55:00]  carry a leg.  Carry a leg.  A long time.  Paul, you're gonna  carry a leg.  Carry a leg.  A long time.  I never pin back  your ankles.  Cause when I try,  you just flip right over. 
[00:55:30]  And in the middle  of the Kama Sutra,  you fall down.  Paul, you're gonna  carry a leg.  Carry a leg.  A long time.  Paul, you're gonna  carry a leg. 
[00:56:00]  Carry a leg.  A long time.  Jesus Christ.  There you go,  Brother Joe.  Hey, I like it.  Some issues.  It's not too bad, man.  She flipped right over.  All right, I'll give him  that one.  He's got another one.  We'll play it in a little  while.  There's a panic going  on outside the studio.  Rick is talking to  Super GM Ken Stevens  about Rick came  running in here to  grab the staple gun  to show Ken Stevens.  Rick is now back  into the studio. 
[00:56:30]  And what is going on,  Rick?  Well, he just has  some concerns,  some questions that I  was trying to answer  for him.  Oh, boy.  That means he's calling  the lawyers.  All right, why don't we  go to Plan B, Anthony?  We'll just take the  10th caller.  Because that's what's  going to happen.  When they call the  lawyers, it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  What has he said?  He said, would you be  willing to take a staple  to prove that it's not  that bad?  Yeah, I'll do it.  And I said, sure.  I'll do it.  If it means we can do  it on the air, I'll do it.  Exactly.  No problem. 
[00:57:00]  No problem.  And you know  something?  I'll watch Hopi do it.  Right in.  Come on.  You're with me, right?  That I got to do it?  Sometimes we got to  lead.  Go down the hall and  tell him I'll take a  staple, no problem.  Ask Ken, will he take  one if we take one?  That's right.  He's the GM.  He's supposed to stand  behind us.  Would you do that?  Yeah.  I mean, it's no, like,  big deal.  You're not going to  need to be hospitalized.  I'll do it. 
[00:57:30]  It's the anticipation  and the pain.  That quick psh.  If it means that we  could do this on the  radio, yes, I will.  And then it gets, you  know what pierce wounds  are like?  They hurt really bad.  Well, because it's like  a bee sting.  Yeah.  And they, like, they  throb and swell up the,  well, the holes.  Do we have John Lennon  on the phone?  John?  John?  John?  John Lennon?  Hello, guys.  I don't have much time. 
[00:58:00]  I'm from the grave, you  know.  From the dead?  What's up, John?  I just wanted to say  that, you know, Paul,  he's like a good life  and if he wants to  remarry, I think, I  think, you know, people  should be, you know,  supportive of that,  you know.  I didn't really have  much to add except  that he could buy  a titanium ankle.  Right.  I'm punching out.  John, can you say,  oh, I wanted him to  say helicopter. 
[00:58:30]  Who knew John Lennon  from the dead?  I'm waiting to see if  Rick's coming down the  hall or not.  With Ken.  With Ken.  I want to know why,  first of all, why do we  have to do it?  That doesn't prove  anything.  Oh, there he is.  I know it can be done.  He's looking, he's got  the staple gun in his  hand.  He doesn't look happy.  Hi, Ken.  Ken, go over there.  Ken.  Super GM Ken Stevens.  You've heard about the 
[00:59:00]  contest we want to run  for the King of the  Ring giveaway?  You might imagine I  had a few questions.  A few questions.  Like, when I call the  attorney and go like  this.  Yeah.  Is he going to go for  that?  Well, there's ways  around it.  It's like a piercing.  That's what I said.  Rick said it'd just be  little tiny staples.  Yeah.  Not too big.  He said he'd be willing  to take a stake so I  could talk to the  attorney and say.  And say they did it.  Yeah.  And then we'll have a  jump off the Brooklyn 
[00:59:30]  Bridge contest if we do  it first.  Let me see that.  I've got a loaded gun  here.  Oh, let me see.  Now, Ken.  Let me see.  Oh, you can't.  Now, Ken.  Let me see.  You can't let him do  that.  Please hold.  Let me just pull this  out.  Okay.  Regardless, it's only  going about a quarter  of an inch.  Well, let me see that.  Ken, if I do this  right now, will you let  us do the contest? 
[01:00:00]  No, I can't.  Why?  I can't let you do  that.  Why?  That's wrong.  That'll hurt.  Dude, you got to go  and do it as you got to  scream right before you  do it and then do it.  Look at Opie, man,  taking one for the team.  But I want him to  promise that if I do it,  then we could do this  on the radio.  Yeah.  I'll do it right now.  It does seem like  the kind of thing  where, hey, Opie did  it.  It's not this big  life-threatening thing.  But I can't promise  that even when I say  Opie did it, because  you know, he might  say, yeah.  I'll even let you 
[01:00:30]  do it to me.  I know at this point  you want to punch me  in the face, so here's  your opportunity.  Put the staple gun down.  Do it to me.  In some twisted way, I  want to see Opie do  this.  I really want to see  this.  What are the odds we  get to do this contest  if I do it?  Yeah.  To show it's no big  deal.  You know, I was  talking about  what's his number.  I don't think I've  ever heard of a contest  that they approved that 
[01:01:00]  involved inflicting  bodily injury on you.  They've never approved  of any contest we do.  Of any of our  contests.  They're horrid.  They've taken away a  lot of the fine  contests.  Look at that bat up  there.  They've taken that  contest away from us.  Right out of play.  Where's the phone  number?  Call him up on the  air.  I'd hate to see you  shoot yourself for  nothing.  Why don't I ask him  first so I know what  the odds are a little  better?  All right.  And you'll report  back to us?  Yeah, like if he says,  look, if Opie will do  it to himself, then it's  okay.  Yeah.  Do it.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, see what he  says.  All right.  Watch out.  Oh, man.  Where did you get  hit, Ken?  Did it wing past his  ear?  I saw him like, he's  just shooting at the  boss with your  staple gun, dude.  I want to make  believe it just went  off.  I must say.  How close is that?  How close?  It was very close.  It went by the back  of his neck.  Same.  I got to say  something right now,  though.  Yeah.  You holding that is  one of the most  dangerous things. 
[01:02:00]  Look at Stinky.  Everybody's looking  like, because I  know you, you  fiddle with stuff and  all of a sudden,  pew, someone's eye  goes out.  No.  They don't shoot  straight.  Don't point it at  me.  Don't point it at  me.  All right.  Let's do it.  The thing, you know  something, when you  nail it into  newspapers, a pile of  newspapers, you really  get the effect that that  thing pushes hard, man.  Let me see.  All right.  I don't even know if I  have the balls to do  this.  Let me see.  Put it on your knee and  do it.  It won't go through the  papers, but it'll give you  a feeling.  Right. 
[01:02:30]  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Dude, here's something  me and you could do  today.  We take the newspapers.  Right.  We go back and forth,  taking one page off at a  time, and see who gets  hit first.  I'll do that.  Come on.  That's fun.  Let's do it.  All right.  We have another  stapler with staples?  That one's full.  Yeah?  I loaded it.  All right.  Start with one newspaper.  Hey, look.  Hey, look.  We're in the paper  today. 
[01:03:00]  You picked that page.  Put it through my head.  Daily News.  Cute little story about  us.  Yeah.  Something about us  running a foul.  We were running a foul.  I'm going to save that  for my little scrapbook.  F-6-7.  First one of those we've  had.  There you go.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  We've got to take a break.  I thought you were going  to do the first round.  Oh, that's easy.  All right.  All right.  Is it?  Is that thick enough? 
[01:03:30]  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Good.  Did it hit?  No, but I...  Seriously.  What is it?  It's already sticking out.  Oh, it's already sticking out.  All right.  All right.  My turn.  Take the page off.  Hey, no.  I do it with a full page.  No.  That's the deal.  We keep going back and forth.  There you go.  This is no fair now.  Already.  Here you go.  No fair.  No fair.  Take the page.  Oh, I felt that a little bit. 
[01:04:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Take another page off of the paper.  There you go.  You're actually removing two sheets.  Yes.  Two sheets because of the full page.  All right.  From the newspaper.  Oh, no.  What did it do?  It went through.  Did it?  Boy, how thick is the goddamn page?  No, dude.  Because you're going to feel it now?  Yeah, I know. 
[01:04:30]  Let's see who bails first.  It's kind of like name that tune.  All right.  I felt a little bit.  You did?  I'm not going to sit here and cry and say that it hurts.  All right.  But you definitely, you could definitely feel it.  All right?  Ah!  There we go.  Did you feel it?  Yeah.  No, you didn't.  I did.  All right.  I swear I did.  I'm just doing that.  Oh, wow.  Look.  It looks a hole.  I'm just doing, you know.  I'm doing the Robert De Niro scream before I do it. 
[01:05:00]  What are you doing?  What the hell are you doing?  Put your pants on.  I don't want to put a hole in my jeans.  Are you kidding me?  What?  It goes between the weave.  All right.  Give me that.  Shut up.  All right.  Oh, God.  You're starting to feel a little more every time.  Yeah, every time.  You never realize how thick a newspaper page is.  There you go.  Until it's a staple through it. 
[01:05:30]  All right.  That's a cute little weight loss picture.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now it's coming through pretty good.  Wow.  All right.  How can't our listeners have fun like this?  This is fun.  All right.  Give me that.  Thank you.  Removed.  Oh.  Isn't it really starting to like...  Yeah.  You can definitely feel it.  There you go. 
[01:06:00]  We're moving on the page.  All right.  Turn it over to me.  Wings win one from cup.  Red Wings zero.  Hurricane zero.  Red Wings.  Oh, Jesus.  Anything?  Yes.  That's getting thin, man.  This is getting thin.  All right.  Who will be the first guy to bail?  You know how the sports section's in the back and all the important stuff is on the first 
[01:06:30]  page of the back of the newspaper?  We're up to penalty kicks in South Korea.  All right.  So we really don't have much of the sports section left.  Give me that.  All right.  First guy to bail.  Oh, my God.  Like, you're feeling it.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Another page off.  Uh-oh.  I see an advertisement.  Are we through the sports page?  Looking forward.  Forget the repeat. 
[01:07:00]  Lakers want more.  Bringing Knicks back to finals is Layden's goal.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Let me put it through Shaq's head.  His big head.  Oh!  Are you out?  Nope.  But I think I'm bleeding.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  You're not out?  Nope. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, God.  He removes another page.  Hey, we're to the real estate section.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  You know, you can buy a nice house in the Poconos.  Okay?  Watch that femoral artery.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Hey, here's a cute little cartoon about Tyson.  Not the comics.  Oh.  Wow, this is getting really thin. 
[01:08:00]  Bill Gallo's cartoon.  Oh, God!  Damn it.  Oh.  Holy crap.  All right.  Another page.  Here's the stapler.  There you go.  Shane Spencer had a grand slam.  Yes, we know.  Okay?  Ooh!  Wow! 
[01:08:30]  All right.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  It started to stick.  Yeah, yeah, I noticed.  All right.  Here you go.  Ah!  Jesus.  Pull these out.  I think I'm getting other staples that are flying into my leg, too.  All right.  Staple it, please.  I'm going to get Andre Agassi and his eight-month-old son, Jaden Gill. 
[01:09:00]  There it is.  Cute little picture.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Where...  Oh, my God!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Oh, damn, it's really starting to sting.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm seeing marks.  I'm seeing marks. 
[01:09:30]  Come on.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  I don't know.  Yeah, I know.  It's starting to really, like, hurt.  We can both bail right now.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Give me that gun.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Jesus! 
[01:10:00]  Wow!  HBO, free installation for three months.  Take another page out of the paper.  Oh, the stocks.  Who cares?  You can start counting how many pages are left now.  It's getting to that point.  I just gave up on the stock market years ago.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  Oof.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, that must have hurt.  It stuck to his leg.  Yep.  All right, like you said, we could both bail.  Oh, no, you're up next.  Oh.  You could bail.  That means I win.  Yeah, I know.  Come on.  Come on, here it is.  Another round.  The biz news.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Hand it over.  Yeah.  Hand it over.  That is very, very thin now.  Oh, it's very thin. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  Do the other leg.  No, I'm keeping the same leg.  Oh, man.  God damn it.  Holy Jesus.  There is just no insulation anymore.  Now it's just.  Oh, you're in now, the now section in the middle of the paper.  That's a pamphlet.  I'm in the, yeah.  Kieran Culkin wants to follow Jody's path to the movies. 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Ow.  Come on, push it.  Some people are having trouble understanding what we're doing.  It's very obvious.  There's the staple gun.  Another sheet of.  We started with a newspaper and every round we're taking a sheet away. 
[01:12:00]  There is, look, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  Ten left.  Ten pages.  Ten, and flipped over again, so 20 pages.  20 pieces of newspaper.  20 layers of paper left.  First guy out.  Loses.  Give me a stapler.  Man still hasn't forgiven his girlfriend for hurting him. 
[01:12:30]  Dear Ann Landers, 12 years ago I was pregnant.  Process of getting a divorce.  I'm just trying to stall.  Sorry.  I just got to see how many marks are in my leg so far.  I'll put it right through Lil' Orphan Annie.  Oh, dude.  Check out your thighs.  Oh, fudge.  Fudge.  Wow, look at that coming right through.  Oh, man.  Dude, check out your thighs.  I did already.  It's like a.  Looks like bee stings all over my leg. 
[01:13:00]  That one is worse, though.  Let me look.  That one's worse.  All right, give me the staple gun.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  He's got track marks.  Good luck.  He looks like the heroin chick from yesterday.  We're down to 18 sheets of paper.  Wow.  All right, give me that.  Good luck.  Give me that.  All right, 18 sheets left between our leg and the staple gun. 
[01:13:30]  Can someone remind me why we're doing this?  Oh, my God.  Well, our contestants will go right into their thigh without a paper.  Right.  Down to 16 sheets.  Just like we are in a matter of.  Oh, look who's back in.  Hi, Ken.  How are you?  What did I miss?  You're missing, like, a lot. 
[01:14:00]  We are taking.  See?  Look.  We're doing it to ourselves.  We're taking the newspaper.  Out of protest, I think.  We started with a full daily news.  And we put it on top of our leg and went through.  And then each time we go back and forth, me and Opie, we're taking a sheet off.  And it's getting thinner and thinner and really, really hurting now.  And the first guy that bails loses.  Ken, have you talked to any of the lawyers?  Yes, I have.  And what is the verdict?  Well, if Opie will take one in the forehead, no.  Leave the comedy to these people. 
[01:14:30]  You in the offices, we never try to be funny.  Yeah.  Never try to be funny in your office, do we?  No, that was an attorney joke, not mine.  What's the prognosis for the bet?  Now, remember, I'm not trying to be funny.  This is what he said.  Oh, no.  Listen to how lawyers are.  Go ahead.  Well, first of all, it has to be like a nurse.  Somebody.  Oh, we got a doctor friend of ours that can come in.  Yeah, okay.  Medical staff.  Neophorn and a Band-Aid on or whatever, so there's no infection.  Uh-huh. 
[01:15:00]  You can't staple one body part to another.  Right.  Now we know that.  We understand that.  Right.  You mean we can in the privacy of our own home?  That's what I was thinking.  He said this.  I'm not making a joke.  He said he'd prefer possibly people would staple themselves in the ass where it would be less.  We could do that.  You know, where it would be less.  Yeah.  Right.  A little more meat.  Yeah.  A little more meat back there.  Yeah.  Yeah, but we're not going to do it.  And how are they going to?  Well, he didn't insist. 
[01:15:30]  No, they could do it.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get it like a really hot dominatrix to help.  All right.  We'll sex up the contest a little bit.  Go ahead, Ant.  Does that mean we have to continue this game?  Oh, yeah.  Ken, would you like to watch?  It's down to how many sheets between the staple gun and the thigh?  I think we're down to 16.  Are you bailing?  Ant's bailing.  Ant's out.  Do it.  Ant's out.  Do it.  Don't do it.  Ant's out.  Ant's out.  Ant's out.  One last sheet. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Now it just downright hurts.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, times two.  14 pages.  14 sheets of newspapers.  Now we're losing huge percents of the thickness.  All right.  Oh, jeez. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, that one hurt.  Yeah.  Now pull it out of your way.  Pull it out of your way.  Oh, that one hurt.  All right.  I have to stop because I'm bleeding through my pants.  I'm quitting.  You can't quit.  Dude, I'm bleeding through my pants.  There's no quitting in staple guns.  Gun roulette. 
[01:17:00]  Bleeding through my pants.  You can't quit.  I concede defeat to you, Opie.  Let me see.  Bravo.  You're the better man.  Let me see the blood.  Oh, my God.  Right through the bed.  All right.  We happy?  Well, I guess.  What we do for you bastards.  You're just going to give me the victory like that?  I have to.  And then you're going to get like three hours of people calling you a pussy now.  I don't care because the last time I did it, right before you just did it, it hurt really bad. 
[01:17:30]  It hurt a lot.  And it's not going to get better.  See, it's not going to be like, wow, we're down to two sheets and this is a breeze now.  And let me just suggest something, though.  Yeah.  If you can make it through the next round, just imagine the pain I'm going to feel.  I know.  Come on.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  Were we down to six after mine?  So there's 12 sheets. 
[01:18:00]  No, because you're an idiot.  I'm going to do it and you're going to go, okay.  I quit.  I'll tell you right now, I do not want to lose this contest.  I know you don't and I'm giving it to you.  Come on.  12 sheets.  It's all about your honor.  The lister's going to call you.  It's not my honor, it's my leg that is bleeding through my pen.  They're going to call you a pussy for the next three hours.  Ah, pussah.  12 sheets.  12 sheets.  I think I have one more in you.  Let me see the thickness.  Feel the thickness. 
[01:18:30]  That's nothing.  It's tissue paper.  Look at this.  Oh, get out of town.  Get out of town.  Shut up, Garrett.  What do you think?  Staple gun.  Do it.  It's really, really, what do you think?  No, you know why?  Because, look, you're going to do it regardless.  We'll see.  You're going to do it regardless, so you win anyway. 
[01:19:00]  I'm not going to, I'm going to have to back out twice.  The only difference is, I'm going to have another staple in my leg.  Maybe I'm putting a poker face on right now.  Do you think?  Maybe I'm a pussy and I'm just trying to.  No, because you won with poker, but you won the pot.  Well, I'm thinking, well, I'm not going to tell you what I'm thinking.  It's like double or nothing.  Come on, Nate.  They're already calling you a pussy all over the years.  I know they are.  I see it.  It's the staple gun challenge.  There's 12 sheets left. 
[01:19:30]  We start at like 100.  Am I handing over the staple gun to you?  Just let me feel it.  All right, here you go.  Here you go.  Come on, do it.  Oh, my God.  Damn, this is really bad.  Do it.  What do you think?  Put the sweat on it, bro.  Oh, no.  Son of a...  Oh, my God.  Damn it.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  That hurt like a mother. 
[01:20:00]  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  That was the answer.  Holy crap.  You win.  Wow.  Here it is with one last seat if you decide to do it.  You win.  Ah, you suck.  You win.  Oh, my God.  All right, what are we up to here? 
[01:20:30]  I have...  No way.  Let me just see.  One, two...  Holy jeez, that stings so bad.  That stings like now it feels like it did at the moment of impact.  It has not stopped hurting.  It's ten sheets left.  Oh, am I a faggot?  Do we have disinfectant soap in the bathroom?  Do we maybe get a real nurse down here?  Because we are bleeding.  Oh, God damn it. 
[01:21:00]  I'm serious.  If there's a nurse nearby with some disinfectant, we could use it today.  Whew.  Wow.  I didn't think you had the balls to do it.  I don't.  I don't have the brains to not do it.  And I saw John over here.  He goes, I just lost a case of beer on Ant.  And I felt bad that, you know, the guy was betting on me.  All I know is, if I could do this, I will definitely win.  You will absolutely win.  And I put you through a lot of pain.  Because I will not do this.  And, Opie, let me tell you something. 
[01:21:30]  I so talked you into that.  Come on.  I know.  But let me tell you something before you do this.  Right.  The one I did before wasn't near as bad as the one I just did.  We are at the point now where I guess the elasticity of the skin is not a matter anymore.  This now hurts so bad when you do it.  And you have two less pieces of paper in between the stapler and you now.  By the way.  So expect a lot of pain. 
[01:22:00]  By the way, we're doing this to make up for Dustin Diamond.  Yeah, see?  We're paying penance here with staples in our legs.  I understand that we stunk and we had to make it up to you.  Ten sheets of paper?  Do it.  Do it.  God damn it.  Do it.  Dude, this is going to hurt so bad.  And I want to enjoy watching it.  Do it.  I don't know if I can do this.  Come on.  The pain is exquisite.  I didn't think you were going to do it.  I didn't either.  I'll tell you what I was really going for.  I was trying to make you look like more of a pussy than you were. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  Like, see what happens?  Oh, my God.  There's no way you'll do it, right, if I do this?  No.  You might.  I might.  He's already got the pain.  Come on.  Look, I'm shaking.  Got paper.  All right.  Look at it.  It's nothing.  There's no paper left.  It's nothing.  We really need a nurse down here.  No joke.  And I know there's a lot of nurses that listen to this show.  Please come by.  First nurse, we'll give you tickets or something because we're going to need something after this. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, my God.  Here he goes.  Are you doing it?  Are you doing it?  Where did you do it on you?  Oh, jeez.  You can't tell where I'm bleeding from.  Where?  Right here?  Yeah.  Right on top.  Put it on.  Yeah.  And hit it and expect.  It's going to hurt so bad.  Watch.  Watch.  Watch this.  Do it.  Do it.  Watch this.  Do it.  Do it.  No.  Dude.  All right.  Hold on.  It hurts so bad. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, God.  It's like jumping from a really high place.  Do it.  Go for it.  Come on.  It hurts really bad, dude.  Come on.  Expect it to really hurt this time.  Quick, quick.  Oh!  Oh, his table was like. 
[01:24:00]  He's running out of the studio.  He's limping.  Dude, I know that hurts so bad, man.  That stings so bad.  So bad.  Right?  Holy S.  Yeah, that's the limit right there.  Well, bravo, Opie.  You are the true staple in the leg champion.  One, two, three. 
[01:24:30]  Eight sheets left.  No.  No.  There's no talking me into this.  Go to break, because I'm going into the bathroom and washing my friggin' leg off.  Come on.  No.  Eight sheets.  No.  There is no way I'm doing this.  Dude, it stings, but it went away pretty fast.  Sorry.  Come on.  Do the other leg.  Sorry.  Sorry that you lost the case of beer, John.  I am not doing this again.  Do the other leg.  No, because I'm not effing up both legs.  Eight sheets.  Nope.  There's no way I'll do six.  Look at you.  There's no way I'll do six.  There's no way I'll do six. 
[01:25:00]  No way.  This is for the win-in.  No.  I cannot.  For the win.  I cannot.  For the win.  Hey, he whose leg has not a staple hole in it.  Shut up with your buck, buck, buck.  For the win.  Chicken noise.  For the win.  No.  No.  For the win.  You won, Opie.  I graciously.  There's no way I can do.  Accept defeat.  Hey, look.  There's no way I can do six.  I take my hand off to you, sir, as Mike Tyson said.  I take my hand off to you.  I want a rematch, though. 
[01:25:30]  What do you think?  No.  Do it.  There is no way.  Just do it.  It really is stinging.  I know.  It stings.  It just stings.  It stings.  What do you think?  There's a reason it stings.  It's not supposed to happen.  Eight sheets left, Ant.  No.  One, two, three, four.  No.  He's thinking.  I see you.  The same guy that just wrote, Ant, you da man, is now writing, Ant, what a pussy.  These frigging people.  Ant, this is definitely for the victory. 
[01:26:00]  Do it.  No, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  No.  For the victory.  Ant, what a girl.  Isolate that clip.  I'm bleeding through my pants.  No, because I feel it still.  And actually, I think I feel stuff ripping.  I'm not doing this again.  Come on.  No, I lost.  You're going to let down our fans.  You know something?  You're going to let them down.  But the people that were rooting for you are really happy, and there's no way I'm doing it.  You're going to let them down.  Look, Ant, look. 
[01:26:30]  Come on.  Just go to another place.  No.  No.  You already won the softball game.  You've got to win this.  Well, you've got to win something.  I am winning in life.  That's how I feel.  Oh, that's how I feel.  Come on, Ant.  I'm a winner.  Come on.  I'm a winner.  It awaits you.  Look, look, look.  It's calling your name.  I am not.  Come on.  Own it.  Anthony.  Own it.  I am not.  Come on.  Be the stapler.  Just own it.  Be the stapler.  Just give that grin, scream, and do it. 
[01:27:00]  It's all you.  Oh, he's thinking.  No, he's thinking.  I'm not.  Just take a look.  Just take a look.  Like an Olympic champion.  Do it.  Just take a look.  Do it.  You've trained all your life.  God.  God.  Oh, God damn it.  Wow.  God.  See, it has to be done with no forethought.  There is no way I'm doing this again. 
[01:27:30]  Wow.  I might have to give you the victory.  I want to curse so bad.  I want to give you the victory.  Let me just.  There are.  Do it.  Do it.  I can't let it beat you like this.  There are one, two, three.  How do they end up with five sheets on it?  No, it should be six.  Six sheets?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  One, two, three.  Oh, man.  I want to watch this.  Let me see.  The adrenaline's starting to kick in now. 
[01:28:00]  He just challenged you.  You've got to take him out.  Take him out here.  Let me see the mark you left.  Dude.  I'll show you.  This is ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  It's going to take a while.  Pull up.  Let me see.  The way you wear your shorts to the beach.  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm a mess.  I'm a mess.  Let me see yours.  Well, I'd have to.  I can't pull it up like you. 
[01:28:30]  See?  Well, do something.  I'll show you during break.  Do it.  There you go.  And now you know how much this hurts.  Now I can't even walk.  I'm a cripple.  It's nothing.  Go to a different place.  Oh.  I don't know.  Own it.  Come on.  It is real bad.  Come on.  Do it.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Oh, God.  Steve is videotaping this, too, by the way. 
[01:29:00]  This will end up on Foundry Music.  Oh, God.  No.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  He was just ready to do it.  See?  You've got to use that no thinking technique and just grab it, plaster it on, and squeeze.  Okay.  Come on.  Do it.  What are you waiting for?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Squeeze.  Squeeze.  Here we go.  Here we go. 
[01:29:30]  The pain is real bad.  Come on.  Come on.  Do it, Nicky.  Do it.  Do it, Nicky.  Do it.  Show these motherfuckers.  Do it, Nicky.  Oh, God.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  Oh, God.  And his hand got pinched in the stapler.  You are a mess.  Pull it out.  Pull it out. 
[01:30:00]  He's dripping.  He's drooling.  He's drooling in pain.  All right, look.  No, no.  Make a deal.  Again.  What?  I win.  You lose.  Oh, yeah.  That's a fine deal.  I wanted that three shots ago.  You can't let him win like that, dude.  Shut up, Rick.  One.  Go ahead.  You do it.  One, two, three, four sheets left.  No, now we're just down to, we just did the staple bit.  And we're, you know.  I think it broke my finger. 
[01:30:30]  What is a couple of sheets of newspaper?  It's not helping, and I shan't, and I am saying this with the utmost sincerity.  At this point, you might as well, because look, now it's just four sheets of nothing.  And it was six when I did it.  Actually, it was eight when I did it.  I did six.  You got to do four.  Very proud of you.  I'm too better.  I'm too better.  You are two more gooder, Opie.  And let it be written, and let it just go in history, because that's it. 
[01:31:00]  Cleveland's saying don't let Opie win.  I don't care, Cleveland.  All right, we'll put you on the clock.  Yeah, come on.  You got 60 seconds.  I'm not, you know something?  I'm not even considering it this time.  60 seconds.  Why not?  Because this laundering isn't even going to help these pants now.  50 seconds.  Don't worry about it, then.  You're worried about the pants being ruined?  No, the leg under it.  Oh, okay.  Looks like Omaha Beach.  You have 40 seconds. 
[01:31:30]  No.  Just do it.  No.  I'm not doing it again.  Just do it.  No.  You have 30 seconds to decide.  Come on.  Come on.  Meow, meow.  Here we go for 30 seconds.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  I'm just thinking at this point, you got to do it, though.  It's only four sheets.  You already know.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  You already know what it's going to feel like.  Meow, meow, meow.  Yeah.  I know what it feels like.  Come on.  You can do it.  Because now it isn't even just the pain.  Now I'm just worried about some permanent injury. 
[01:32:00]  What do you say?  Five seconds.  No.  Come on.  Opie, you win.  Two.  Come on.  Just grab it and do it.  Opie is the winner.  Very good.  I didn't think you were going to go for that last one.  I will take a victory staple for the team.  Stop it.  Oh.  No.  No way.  No way you're putting a staple in your leg.  No way.  No newspaper.  Nothing.  No way.  No way.  What the?  What are you?  Nuts?  Do it.  This is for the victory.  No way. 
[01:32:30]  It's empty.  No way.  Why?  Come on.  Push it down.  Push it down.  Stop it.  There's no pressure.  No way.  There you go.  Yeah, you do it, Rick.  You do it, Rick.  That's okay.

[01:33:00]  Okay.  This is for just giggles.  It takes a lot, Rick.  Yeah, you got to just like...  All right.  Oh, he's squeezing the head.  He's squeezing.  It's almost there at that top point.  Here, get my hand.  Right at that top point.  Got it.  Okay. 
[01:33:30]  Okay.  Oh, almost had it there.  Yeah, yeah.  Take that breath and just...  Bam.  Throw it in.  Pull it out.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Ouch.  Dude, you are so red.

[01:48:30]  Here comes the radio now.  Now you like me now, I say.  Here comes the radio now.  Here comes the voice on the sound.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show, P.O.D. Boom.  Phones are going nuts.  It hurts now than when I did it.  Yeah, it's like the same hurt.  It's not going away.  As a matter of fact, I went into the bathroom, scrubbed the area with antibacterial soap, 
[01:49:00]  and then rinsed it off, and then took the alcohol and just rubbed the crap out of it with alcohol.  And now as I'm touching it, the whole area is kind of numb, right?  It's like numb and tingly.  Like all the nerves are just pissed off in that area, and they're shut down.  My thigh feels like it got stung by like, I don't know, 10 or 12 bees.  Yeah, like bees.  And now compare it with your other leg.  Like run your hands over your thigh and your leg. 
[01:49:30]  It's like swollen up a little bit.  Yeah, it's starting to swell already, and there's little bruises around each individual staple mark.  Great.  Black and blue.  Jason, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  Hey.  Hurt so bad.  What?  His phone sucks.  Jason, call back.  Your phone really stinks.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Opie, you're a psycho.  In the words of Mike Tyson, I take my hand off to you.  Hey, Opie, that was too funny.  The whole time you guys are doing that, Rick is in the background screaming, come on, do 
[01:50:00]  it, come on, do it.  He's like that Viet Cong guy in the roulette scene in Deer Hunt, I'm screaming, meow, meow.  Here's the little two.  At DeNiro and walking.  Rick was very excited.  Very excited.  Meow.  You guys rock.  All right, thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Do it, Nicky, Nicky, do it.  Rick really enjoyed that.  Yeah, he really did.  And he's calling people pussy.  Dean, he didn't even do it.  Take one for the team, Rick.  It's anti-climatic. 
[01:50:30]  We're going to have the contest tomorrow with the guys, though.  The staple gun roulette game for the WWE trip.  It's going to make it a little more fun for us, I think, now, because we're going to know  the pain that they're going to be feeling.  And they're going right into their butts.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  We had a...  The lawyers determined that...  Yeah, we had a wheel and deal with the lawyers.  They're helping us out this time around.  Charles, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, the last time I heard guys screaming in pain, another guy yelling, pull it out.  I was in prison.  Smart ass. 
[01:51:00]  Light of us.  Yeah, I was like, pull it out.  It's bleeding.  Yeah, some of those sounds must have sounded kind of funny.  Devin, what's up?  All right, Devin.  All right, hold on.  You've got to save me after he's screaming, pull it out.  Pull it out.  I'm bleeding through my pants.  Ah, you dick.  Opie, why would you think it wouldn't hurt if you put alcohol on it?  We're stupid.  Devin, I don't know what made their radio because he used the P word for leaking, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  But Devin said it was really funny to hear, pull it out.  I'm bleeding through my pants.  Yeah.  All right, Devin.  All right.  He's having fun.  All right.  Boy, and you know something, we have never totally just checked our brain at the door  and done anything like that.  Uh-oh, Ken Stevens is coming back in.  Uh-oh.  Ben, what's up?  Go get Ken.  It's right outside the door.  You guys are un-friggin'-believable.  Thank you.  I thought you guys were doing another The Oz trivia game thing. 
[01:52:00]  Unbelievable.  Sick.  You guys rule.  Wait till, thank God Steve was in here taking video.  Because, no, I don't think anyone could actually believe the pain and the injuries that have  been sustained unless it was videotaped.  It'll be up on Foundry Music.  It was kind of fun.  Yeah.  I like getting my adrenaline going every once in a while.  I need to twist it away.  Christy, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  I was next door with my, my best friend lives next door and her husband and my boyfriend 
[01:52:30]  don't know, but we've been kind of fooling around.  Yeah.  So I was over there and I usually have to leave by like quarter of max because that's  when our husband gets home.  Well, we turned the radio on when you guys were like, I think you were like on page 12.  Oh, that bad language.  You're a little potty mouth girl.  Okay.  It was so effing what?  It was so effing hot.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Hot.  Because you guys like breathed really hard before you did it.  You know, you were like, like that. 
[01:53:00]  Oh my God.  I don't know if we're sick or what, but it was a real big turn on.  I didn't know we were going to turn on girls today.  You effing broads will never cease to amaze me with what you find hot.  And there's a better story here.  So your husband leaves for work and you go to the neighbor's house and have some fun  lesbo action, huh?  Oh yeah.  We've been doing it for years.  How did that get started?  We've known each other since high school and I just bought my house recently and I didn't  know, but she lived next door.  So it was kind of like a bonus because we used to actually fool around in elementary 
[01:53:30]  school.  Really?  Yeah.  So you guys just hang out and get naked all day long until the husband pulls up in the  driveway?  Well, not all day long.  I mean, I get out of work at two, so I guess like from two till like three thirty.  Two to three thirty.  You got a little time there with your girlfriend.  Yeah.  And you just do a little bit of everything, huh?  We do a lot of everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happens at the parties where you're together?  You give each other the eye like, hey, I know.  Yeah.  Well, we like really hard music.  Yeah.  So, you know, it gets pretty rough.  I like it.  Your husband doesn't know about this? 
[01:54:00]  Well, no, I'm not married.  I have a fiance.  Her husband, you know, I mean, it's close enough, though, but no, they neither of them  know about it.  I mean, they knew that we used to know each other, but they don't know that we know each  other.  They're probably like spending their time together.  I wish.  Oh.  Some girls find that hot.  I just don't get it.  No, thanks.  All right.  All right.  Well, this is fine.  We'll give you guys a let you know, but you're turning on girls in math.  Oh, thank you.  Till this day.  Thank you, Kristen.  Bye.  Bye.  I found it hot, Hopi.  Hot.  Ray, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Pretty good, Ray. 
[01:54:30]  I hope you guys will do this crap when I'm trying to commute.  I've damn near gotten about three accidents.  On the checking your brain at the door comment, I just wanted to pass on, I'm driving next  to somebody here who's in a similar state.  It's a Land Rover Discovery thing, green here on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  Got Arabic writing all over the damn rear window, and the tag frame says, I'd rather be  flying my Cessna.  I mean, this guy's got a damn deadlift.  Oh, man.  Wow.  I mean, no kidding.  This is just nuts.  I couldn't, the windows are well tinted. 
[01:55:00]  I can't see what's going on.  Okay, guys, keep it up.  I'm not going to listen to you tomorrow, because I'll definitely wreck it if other people are  doing that crap.  Have a good one.  Could you get a picture of that guy's car?  I wish I could.  I normally do carry my camera with me, but I don't have it today.  Sorry.  The plate number.  That's insane.  I don't think you share the plate number.  Thank you, Ray.  All right.  I got to go.  Bye.  Ray, I want to call it the more balls than brains segment of the show.  Might have to pull that out every so often, the more balls than brains segment.  We might have to take another break to catch up, because we went like an hour. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, we went a long time there, people.  So don't bitch.  But when we come back, well, you know what?  We can play the other brother, Joe, song before we go to break.  Cool.  And when we come back, we got a Stalker Patty update.  More painful to us than Staples, Patty.  And this is kind of frightening for one of the salesgirls upstairs, because Patty delivered  this letter I hold in my hand to one of the salesgirls at 6 in the morning, something  like that?  6 and 7 in the morning.  Yeah.  We'll get the story from Rick, because Rick talked to Judy from upstairs. 
[01:56:00]  And Judy is now going to, well, we'll explain, because it'll give it away.  But she's not happy that Stalker Patty ran into her around between 6 and 7 this morning.  In a place, Stalker Patty should not be running into anyone that works for this radio station  here in New York City.  All right.  But first, Anthony Paul McCartney.  Yeah.  Marrying his lovely girlfriend there with the one leg.  She got the one leg thing going.  She's working it.  One leg.  So Brother Joe figured it would be a nice thing to exploit. 
[01:56:30]  Of course he did.  Look at me just blaming him.  Why not?  This sick bastard.  Yes.  So another song by Brother Joe about Paul McCartney getting married.  Are we going to redo that bit for 520?  We should.  No.  No, not today.  When we're on vacation, though, yes.  Oh, yeah.  We'll be right back. 
[01:57:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:57:30]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop. 
[01:58:00]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  She has her stuff.  Lady McCartney, outside on the deck.  Guess the rate there's trauma chewing on your leg.  She has her stuff. 
[01:58:30]  She has her stuff.  Then I lift her skirt and see that stump.  Close my eyes and stand aside while effing.  She has her stuff.  Lady McCartney, or should I say Eileen?  How you gonna curse you when you meet the queen? 
[01:59:00]  Are you ready?  Opie and Anthony are gonna touch you or it's dirty.  Take it like a champ, okay?  The Opie and Anthony show.

What's going on?  Hey.  Hi, ma'am.  Listen, uh, being that you guys stapled yourselves, how do you think Steve-O felt when he did it 
[02:08:00]  to his yam bag?  Yeah, that I can't even, uh, I can't even imagine.  Yeah, I'm not even going to act like I'm a tough guy.  No way.  Did you guys see the video?  Uh, of course we did.  That video is freaking hilarious.  When it comes down to we are wimps, yeah, I mean, you know, compared to Steve-O, we can't  play in his league.  But yeah, D standing over here, you can deal with it, huh?  But it was still fun, and it hurt a lot.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right, John.  I like how the, I like how the...  Yeah, I'm not going to sit here and brag.  We did watch Steve-O take the same, uh, staple gun and take his yam bag, a little piece of 
[02:08:30]  his, and staple it right to his thigh, so...  And you know that's why the lawyers said, no stapling body parts to other body parts.  Yeah.  Because they know it's not like, okay, thumb to forefinger.  You know it's just going to be something bad.  So, uh, tomorrow we do the staple gun roulette game.  Yeah.  We got all our contestants that are going to come in.  We're going to have, what, like ten staple guns?  Yeah, about, uh, well, however many contestants we have.  Uh, and there'll be, uh, staple guns.  All of them but one are going to be empty.

[02:10:00]  Mm-hmm.  They have no effing clue about the Stalker Patty thing.  Oh!  Ant's really good at this, though.  Okay, let me think.  And Ant does this really quickly, so you gotta listen.  Okay, people in Reno.  This is what Stalker Patty's all about.  And all the other markets, uh, markets, all the other cities are moaning right now.  They gotta, uh, F them.  Oh, they're explaining.  They don't know.  They're explaining things again.  I'm going to the other rock station in town.  I'm gonna rock for a while.  I'm gonna listen to something else for a couple. 
[02:10:30]  Stalker Patty, uh, was here doing a benefit.  She was answering phones for a benefit when we got here, uh, to this New York station.  Four years ago.  She's, uh, has the body of an army ant, a little antly type body, stringy hair, glasses.  She's a 46-year-old virgin.  She's a foundling.  She's a foundling.  She was abandoned at birth.  She, she's a mess, is what she is.  And she's completely obsessed with the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[02:11:00]  Can you tell Reno, um, a cute little story about her parents?  Ha ha ha.  Oh, let me just chuckle first.  Um, her mother was, as we could figure it out, as close as we could figure it, was a stripper.  Or maybe even a prostitute.  I'm not sure.  She was having sex with this, uh, Wall Street executive.  Who was married with kids.  Who was married, kids.  Had, uh, gotten her pregnant.  And this stripper, whatever she was, pregnant.  She had had the baby, that was Patty.  And, uh, decided she, uh, didn't want Patty. 
[02:11:30]  So went to a diner in Manhattan.  And, uh, left her in a little wicker basket on the counter of the diner.  And walked out, never to be seen again.  So Patty went through all kinds of things.  Isn't that how Superman started his life?  That is like Superman.  But only he was put in that big thing and sent into space.  Where he later landed on Earth.  And I hear Moses had a brother.  And the brother, that's how his life started.  Really?  Yeah, they set him down like, uh, the Nile River.  But they did that with Moses.  Yeah, they did.  It was Moses.  But then there was like a brother. 
[02:12:00]  Then the queen found him.  It was a brother.  Someone will help me out.  Raised him as royalty.  What?  Stupid Dudley Moore movie, Holy Moses.  Are you getting a religious history out of the movie, Holy Moses?  Well, Moses had a brother, yeah.  And his life.  Holy Moses.  His life, uh, turned out a little differently.  Right.  She was a foundling, is what it's called.  They were, uh.  It's got to be real.  It was on the big screen.  Putting a foundling home.  Right.  Religion from Holy Moses.  It's a classic.  But what happened to the, the Moses brother? 
[02:12:30]  I'm trying to remember.  As far as I know, there wasn't one.  He hooked up with Gregory Hines.  Right.  They went back to the castle, right?  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, he kept thinking he was the chosen one.  And he was a bad guy, right?  I was like, okay.  All right.  But the brothers weren't really in danger because they were only killing the firstborn.  So they sent Moses out.  I believe in the Holy Moses story.  He was the firstborn.  Yeah, but there was another one.  And it wasn't like Richard Pryor, like the other Moses or something? 
[02:13:00]  Right.  When he got older, right.  I'll tell you.  Yeah.  Okay.  I got to watch the movie again and get up on my history.  Someone will help us out on this and feedback.  The story of Holy Moses.  Holy Moses.  All right.  Go ahead.  They, uh, they, she left her on a, on a diner, a counter in a wicker basket.  Then, uh, she was put through all kinds of foster homes.  And then she, she was put in a foundling home.  I've never even heard that.  It's like a little house on the prairie reference.  All right.  Fast forward to the, to the point in her life where she decided to enter ours. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  She, uh, she was answering phones for a benefit that was going on here.  She kind of, uh.  The disinfectant is here.  She started, um, do you want to spray some on you first?  Yeah.  Give, I thought a nurse was coming by.  Yeah.  That's your nurse.  Help us out.  The Dwayne Reed Drugstore bag.  What is it?  Lanicane.  Lanicane.  That's good stuff.  This will rock?  Yeah.  It leaves pain and itch.  You don't have to take the top off.  It's off.  Oh.  It's just a spray thing.  All right.  Go ahead.  It leaves pain and itch.  Spray it on your sack. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  So, uh, Patty was doing, uh, phones for a benefit and she, uh, kind of got into the  show.  She started stalking this program.  Mostly Opie.  She could be seen any day of the week sitting outside the building.  She always finds her way in here.  And, uh, she, she turns into being a real pain in the ass.  She was trying to buy gifts.  She's a pathetic mess.  Well, the mistake we made was inviting her up here for the first time.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  You, you take over.  I'm going to go, uh, spray.  So then, uh, the years go by and we humiliated her many, many times.  She would come in with, like, handmade gifts.  We'd smash them in front of her face.  And, uh, we shaved her head for a month.  No, for U2 tickets.  And, and then, uh, we decided to shave her head again this past, uh, Saturday at our  celebrity softball game in front of 7,000 people.  That stings.  Could you blow on it?  We, who are you talking to? 
[02:15:00]  The audience.  Oh, okay.  Uh, and then, uh, we decided after shaving her head for the second time in front of  7,000 people that we had no more, uh, no need for her anymore.  Oh, but this just in Reno's asleep.  Oh.  So Monday, so the Monday after the game, we pretty much kicked her off the radio show.  Yeah.  Uh, we gave her a wig, you know, so she could go through her life, you know, not looking  completely ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  And we decided at the last moment that, uh, it wasn't good enough that we kicked her out 
[02:15:30]  of the show and, and, uh, escorted her out of the building.  We needed the wig back and, uh, it was forced off her head as she's screaming.  And yelling, um, to, uh, a bunch of people on the streets.  Right?  Right.  So it brings us to today, kinda.  Yeah.  Well, there was a huge outlash, uh, outcry, backlash from what, uh, you did.  Yeah.  To Patty.  Yeah.  And that was the last we saw of her.  So she has written a letter.  Holy, uh, uh, she's, she went to a couple ONA events already. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  Or a couple station events, one of them being ours.  Mm-hmm.  So she was fine with everything.  And that's what we were trying to tell people.  Nothing phases this, uh, lady.  Okay?  She is a true stalker.  So, Anthony, I got a letter.  This is the Stalker Patty official update.  Mm-hmm.  Um, Judy came down, who works in sales upstairs.  Mm-hmm.  And she was kind of, uh, horrified.  Horrified by Stalker Patty.  Yeah, she goes, I, I got a letter from Stalker Patty and you're not gonna believe how I got it. 
[02:16:30]  All right, how did she get it?  Rick?  Yeah, Ann hasn't heard this yet.  All right.  Judy this morning, between the hours of 6 and 7 a.m., was at a gym working out.  She was in a locker room getting changed with some of the people she works out with.  Oh, my God.  And in comes Patty.  Hi.  Just kind of conveniently walks up and says.  Shows up, shows up at the gym.  Was she nude?  I think so, yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Is Judy around?  Uh, I don't know.  Do they listen upstairs?  They might.  Was Judy, like, in a compromising position in the locker room?  She was, she felt kind of weird because she was, you know, in between, I guess, dressing.  Oh, gee.  Patty went right into the locker room?  Yeah.  In this gym?  How did she know she was in the gym?  That's what we're not sure about.  Because Judy's not like you and I and other people that are kind of high profile.  Pretty low profile.  As far as the radio show goes, no one really knows what, uh, who Judy is and what she does. 
[02:17:30]  Did she follow her there?  See, the thing is, Judy remembered this morning, she goes, you know what, she has seen me come  down and say hello to Pharrell in the morning a few times.  You know, who knows?  Who knows where she followed her from there?  She might have followed her there.  I'd love to find out.  So then they're trying to kick her out of the gym and then Patty's going, no, I'm with  Judy.  Yeah.  And then she proceeds, I guess, tell me if I'm wrong, to read this letter we're about  to read in front of everybody.  Wait, wait, so she's standing there, Patty's got the letter in her hand, and starts reading 
[02:18:00]  it aloud to Judy?  And everybody else around.  And everyone else in the locker room.  Now, Judy, I guess, is with some clients, high profile clients, that spend big money on  this radio show.  Right.  And this radio station.  Judy's completely horrified.  She doesn't know what to do.  But she's just standing there, kind of like...  How weird is that?  That is very strange.  Very strange.  So then Judy came down to our office and gave us the letter, and here it is. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, if we could get in touch with Judy, that'd be great.  Here it is.  From Patty.  This is the Stalker Patty update.  Picture her reading this aloud in a locker room with semi-clad women.  Oh, play that sad walking away song from The Incredible Hope.  Hi, guys.  This is how she talks, Reno.  What it is, and where it's at. 
[02:19:00]  The buzz box on me.  Now, I guess this station does something called the buzz box.  Yeah.  News, so she kind of picks up that and puts it in her letter, because she's obsessed with  the station.  Yes.  I'm now living in the Queens Women's Shelter, and I'm waiting word on housing to come through  for me in Times Square.  I have to sign in and out of the facility when I enter and leave.  Bed check is 10 p.m., and I have to sign for my bed every night. 
[02:19:30]  I also have counseling available to help me into permanent housing as quickly as possible.  Thank God this is just temporary in a situation which will soon pass.  I do appreciate all the help people have given to me in terms of mural support, shelter, etc., in the last month.  All I can say is thank you. 
[02:20:00]  I don't know how else to express myself.  She's thanking us.  She's thanking us.  The beaten dog that licks your face.  I especially appreciate being allowed to keep my wig.  This is no joke.  This is her letter, because we did give her the wig.  Yeah.  Finally gave it to her.  A baldy with a touch of mullet does not become me.  There's a valuable late, what did I learn? 
[02:20:30]  Again, another show reference from a show she's obsessed with.  Before anyone touches my head again, demand payment up front.  Anthony, the 220 dealers I actually got did come from you, and I appreciate you being a man of your word.  I was supposed to receive 960 dealers.  Oh, Judy left already? 
[02:21:00]  Well, she's got a cell phone call to show.  Go ahead, Ann.  Didn't you pay her?  Yeah, we all pay.  Yeah.  Not everyone paid her.  Yeah.  She didn't get the 906 bucks.  I'm not, what am I, a bill collector?  All right, go ahead.  I was supposed to receive 906, and even though that didn't happen, that's okay.  I'm not expecting it, and I'm able to overlook things.  The imputant thing is I keep my end of the bargain.  I feel I did a great job out there on that ball field, cooperating and cutting hair that took eight months to grow. 
[02:21:30]  I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do it.  When Patty is using the word diss, it is officially out of any hip vocabulary.  Frenchie dissed me, yo.  Walking humbly from one base to the next, all the way to home plate.  I do deserve credit for the ultra-fantastic sport that I was. 
[02:22:00]  And it wasn't an easy thing for me to do.  I performed like a super Patty.  I still continue to love and support the show.  Opie, you're the devil incognito.  I swear.  But, yo, I gotta give that nigga some mad props.  That's not in the letter. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, no, that's not.  Just thought maybe she was being hip again.  Just read the letter.  Opie, you're the devil.  I swear you are a genuine, bona fide membership, card-toting member of the resident of Hades.  I was listening last week as you were talking about me.  And it's fair to say you got a couple of things inaccurate there.  But if approached by anyone who may have listened, I'm only gonna tell them the truth as I am an honest person. 
[02:23:00]  Where are my digs at?  But you do have an elite and prime imagination.  Not to mention that you're quite the comedian.  Comedy Central needs creative minds like Opie's.  Need to mention the talent.  Ha, I can forgive Opie because he makes me laugh.  How can I stay mad at someone who tricks me up? 
[02:23:30]  My sides are splitting.  I wish they were because I'll bus hit you.  Anyway, next week I may have a crib again at last.  A crib.  And maybe I can be open to Patty's Cribs, too.  See, she will never go away.  I can't commute because I don't have a mad hooptie yet. 
[02:24:00]  Judy's right there.  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  I hope to come back soon.  Have a happy love, Patty.  A bit of a way, Satan and Anthony.  May I suggest some ideas of my own for the show?  How about administering one of these...  I...  What is that?  IQ type test?  Yeah, IQ type.  To characters and friends hang us on to the show and see how they score as a goof.  Two, best beauty contest for the perfect tense among us. 
[02:24:30]  Three, team C put the word teen in front of anything and it's more gooder.  Teen wet t-shirt contest, bikini contest, 55 gallons.  Most offensive cheer contest for the second shift.  Well, whatever.  Hey, what about my message with the happy ending that I was supposed to have left here?  Massage, massage.  Massage.  Message.  What do I know? 
[02:25:00]  Now that may be entertaining.  See?  I can contribute to the show just...  That's right.  We were supposed to get her a massage with a happy ending.  There you go.  A happy ending for the masseuse.  Nothing phases the girl.  No, see?  And she'll never go away.  Never.  All the crap that she was given and she's still clawing her way back.  Well, Judy.  I'm so glad I got to hear it without the benefit of sharing it with some high-profile clients.  I have to ask you, do you have any idea how she knew where you were? 
[02:25:30]  I'm hoping...  I'm thinking it was just...  A coincidence?  But she just recognized you in there?  Well, she was going into the ladies' room.  To just use the ladies' room?  To use the ladies' room.  I don't know.  That's a little odd.  Between six and seven in the morning?  Well, this was like 7.15.  Yeah.  So, she's going to use the bathroom and she just goes, oh, boy, how are you?  I know you.  Will you watch my stuff?  Will you watch my stuff? 
[02:26:00]  My stuff while she went to the ladies' room.  Uh-huh.  And she came back and then asked me if I would bring this letter to you.  Uh-huh.  And then she needed to read the letter to me and to everyone else in the locker room.  Oh, my God.  Now, was there any nudity in the locker room at this point?  Well, there are people.  Women in and out.  So, there's women.  You know, getting ready.  Getting ready.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I wasn't exactly dressed for work at the time.  And she stands there.  And reads the letter.  And starts reading this letter in front of you and the people you're with. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  And anyone else who would be there to listen.  Anyone else who would listen.  And what were you thinking?  Well, I was too horrified to think.  Yeah.  And then I thought I would come in here and kill Opie and Anthony.  It's a great hot scene ruined by Patty, right?  And isn't it true?  The female locker room.  They were trying to get her out of there and she said she was with you?  Well, yeah.  The receptionist came in to say, you don't belong here.  And then she said, well, I know her.  And I said, I'll walk her out. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  I'll make sure she's gone.  All of a sudden, you're put in a very uncomfortable position.  Yes.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yeah.  Now you're responsible for getting her out of there.  Right.  And now if people see her again, they're like, oh, that's...  Oh, that's Judy's friend.  That's Judy's buddy.  And I still had to call my friend from the New York Times to have her call, just turn on the radio so she would understand what this was all about.  Right.  Oh, the New York Times.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well, she's on my side of the New York Times. 
[02:27:30]  That's not somebody you want to see you in that kind of position.  No, not at all.  How embarrassing.  Yes, thank you for this.  Bringing your friends into my personal room.  Well, you know, we have tried so hard to keep her out of this show's life.  Right.  And I also was asked what that massage, what the happy ending was.  Well, massage...  She didn't quite understand that.  She said, she asked me what the, what you meant by a happy ending on the massage. 
[02:28:00]  Well, we were going to get like a beefcake to come down here and massage Patty.  Massage her and then, you know, massage a few special places that might result in her having a very happy ending.  Because she is a virgin and we figured we'd help her out.  Give her a little.  But we're not doing it now.  No, no.  But I had to do that explanation, give her that explanation.  Oh, my God.  You had to tell her that.  I had to tell her what it was.  She's asking.  Not, not her friends, Opie and Anthony.  She's asking you sexual questions.  Right.  And she's not my child. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, my God.  How embarrassing.  In front of these other people, mind you.  While I'm partially dressed.  Oh, God damn.  That is so embarrassing.  I'm dying.  I know you are.  I know you are.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up, Tom?  Yo, it's totally your fault.  Every freaking thing that's going on with this woman.  You took advantage of her from the very beginning.  So if she has a nervous breakdown or stalks you guys even more, you deserve it.  Especially you, Opie.  Uh-huh.  Your heart was prick.  Uh-huh. 
[02:29:00]  Anything else?  No, it's totally the truth.  You're blaming everything on the woman.  You cause her to lose her place and everything else.  And now you're making fun of her.  The woman's like half a psychopath and got no mind of her own, but you guys continue to  ask with her.  I hope this is a bit, man.  Tom, it's too bad you just don't get it.  No, I do get it.  No, you don't.  She enjoys it, though.  No, you don't, because she enjoys every moment of this.  No, she's living in a shelter in Queens.  She must be really enjoying herself.  If she's going to get a place in Times Square. 
[02:29:30]  Uh, Tom, she was doing all that before we met her.  Her life's not going to change.  They were ready to kick her out in Staten Island.  We had nothing to do with that.  We might have been a fight.  It's kick her out because of you guys.  I listen every day.  Come on.  That's not really true.  If she spent more time trying to get her life together and not on this program, perhaps  she'd do a little better.  And she loves it.  She can't wait to be back on the show.  I don't know.  We gave her life purpose, believe it or not.  I know that sounds sick, but we have.  Yeah, she's kind of, you know, she's kind of a celebrity when she goes out to these events. 
[02:30:00]  Well, she's not stable, but, you know, something bad's going to wind up happening.  And then you guys are going to get the blame for it.  Oh, well.  All right.  Later.  All right, Tom.  Well, Tom has his opinion.  Tom, take her in.  There you go.  Wasn't Tom standing there while she walks into a locker room and starts reciting stuff to  her?  Because the second you get friendly with her, for any reason, I'm talking any reason,  that guy Tom's like, well, you exploit her, you do this.  Whatever.  That's his opinion.  Ah, we ain't going to change his mind.  But any time she gets involved with anybody under any circumstances, whether it's this 
[02:30:30]  show or somebody shows her some goodwill and takes her into their home, she just runs  wild with it.  She becomes obsessed.  It has nothing to do with how she's treated.  She says hello to somebody.  All of a sudden, you know, she's in their life.  Enigma for Boston.  Patty sounds like Tyson begging for a rematch.  Hey, Mike, go ahead.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I really hope you, I thought you guys kind of went over the line last week, but after 
[02:31:00]  hearing that letter, she deserved what she got last Tuesday.  She'll never.  She just ran downstairs and smacked her across the head.  You know, I mean, a lot of people felt bad, but you know what?  It didn't even faze her, and she loved every minute of it, and she'll never go away.  This is awful.  I mean, this, she actually now sounds dangerous.  You two have enough money.  Get some bodyguards.  Damn.  She met Judy in a locker room in a health club.  This is dangerous.  I mean, come on.  You know, this, I mean, she really has some stalker skills.  I mean, this, you know. 
[02:31:30]  Thank you, Mike.  Adam wants in real fast.  We got to move on.  Adam.  Yeah.  What's up, Adam?  I mean, I want to talk about that guy, Tom.  Yeah, go ahead.  She's a loser.  Patty deserves everything that she gets.  What is it?  What about Patty?  Like, what about Bob?  What about Petty?  Petty.  She deserves everything she gets.  You shouldn't even read the letter that she sent you guys.  Well, I think.  You can't even read it.  I don't even acknowledge her anymore.  Well, a lot of people are very pissed off to this day, and we're just giving them a 
[02:32:00]  little something to grab for.  They needed their Patty update to make sure she's okay.  Of course she's okay.  Of course she is.  I've also heard she's been in the building already since last week.  Boy caught up from the show, man.  All right, Adam.  Thank you.  Peace.  Bye.  Joe, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What about O&A?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Stalker Patty should no longer be called Stalker Patty.  It should be Cable Patty.  Are you my pal?  Yeah, I'm your pal.  Cable Putty. 
[02:32:30]  Cable Putty.  O&A rule.  Norton rules.  Where is he?  I'm not in today.  Yeah, not in.  He had to take a break.  Norton's a slacker.  All right.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  All right, enough on the Patty thing.  But there you go.  There's the latest thing.  She does just connect herself to people the second they acknowledge her in any way.  Any way.  Good, bad.  It doesn't matter.  She just leeches on.  John, what's up?  Man, you know, by day two or three of that the other week, I thought I had calmed down 
[02:33:00]  a little bit because you guys were rough, man.  But now to find out that you guys didn't even give her the money she was doing, you guys  are fouled, man.  Did I read something that you didn't understand, sir?  When did we say we didn't pay her?  Didn't you just now say that she didn't get paid completely by everybody?  Because some of the guys associated with the show bailed on us.  That's not right.  It was up to you guys to make sure she got paid, man.  Wrong.  I said I was going to pay that leech 110 bucks.  I gave her 220 on the day of the game. 
[02:33:30]  Period.  If Norris or anyone else said they were going to pay her and didn't pay her, that's my problem.  Suck it, John.  It is not.  We both gave her over 200 bucks.  You pay her the rest of the money, John.  You pay her.  You're so concerned.  And then we had some.  You're so concerned.  We're not foul.  We did what we took care of our end of the bargain.  If somebody does it to your little sister or something like that, all right, whatever.  I do it to my little sister.  Like all of a sudden now, if 10 people call up and say they're all going to pony up a bunch 
[02:34:00]  of money to give to her and it amounts to 900 bucks and no one comes through and I pay her twice  what I said I was going to pay her, then I'm supposed to come across with the rest?  You're the scumbag.  Screw off.  Go F.  All right.  Asses.  I'm in Queens.  I got to sign in and sign out.  Ed, what's up?  Go to the zoo.  Hey, what's up, you guys?  How are you? 
[02:34:30]  Hey, you guys, that was the most saddest story I've ever heard in my life.  Very sad.  Yeah, too bad.  It's a good thing she's gone.  Hey, listen, Moses, it was the firstborn sons they were killing, not just the firstborn child.  Okay, but I mean, I want the holy Moses story.  Yeah, well, Moses, when he was born, he was the firstborn son of the family, so the mother  drifted him to the sea.  I know that, but Moses had a brother.  We all know it.  We saw the movie.  What?  Aaron was his brother.  He was also the translator for Moses.  And he grew up to be Richard Pryor, right? 
[02:35:00]  Sure, why not?  So Richard Pryor rules...  Oh, Dudley Moore?  Then who was Richard Pryor?  I don't know.  I didn't see that movie.  He was Pharaoh.  I forgot about it.  Richard Pryor was the Pharaoh?  Ah.  So Dudley Moore ruled some land somewhere?  Yeah, he did.  As Moses' brother?  I don't know.  I don't remember the movie.  All right.  Thank you, Ed.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Look at that.  We're going to move on now, Anthony.  People get so emotional when we talk about Patty. 
[02:35:30]  I don't understand why.  Gene, what's up?  If she spent one night with any of these people, they would wish for her death.  I swear to you.  All these guys, man, you guys are rough.  All right.  All right, Patty, you come live with me for one night.  Oh, hi.  Where's the popcorn?  I spilled the orange juice here.  I can't shower, so my stinky foot is going to be up on your couch.  And even after I'm gone a year, you're going to smell my odor.  Oh, yeah, but, you know, you're being rough on it.  Hey, I took a shower, and I left a dead poodle in the drain. 
[02:36:00]  And if you notice, I don't have any hair on my head, so you guess where it came from.  And the whole time, I'm going to tell you how pathetic I am.  Yeah.  And then you get pissed.  Go ahead.  And you give her more and more and more, and she'll tell you how that.  And she'll keep coming and coming and telling you how pathetic she is.  And you just said one night.  I thought you said a year, so I'm going to stay.  What's up, Greg?  Gene, I think.  Gene.  Yeah, yeah, this is Gene.  What's up?  Hey, I just wanted to talk to you about Stalker Patty. 
[02:36:30]  Last week, I tried to get a hold of you guys, and I was heading to the dump.  When I got to the dump, I looked at Trash Compactor, and I said,  that's where Patty should be.  Bald head and awed.  In the Trash Compactor at the dump.  All right, Gene.  Thank you.  You bet.  Bye.  Uh, Scott, what's going on?  Hey, how are you guys doing today?  Pretty good, Scott.  Hey, one of your biggest problems with Stalker Patty is that she craves the abuse. 
[02:37:00]  I've been in the lifestyle of BDSM for a very long time, and it is a lifestyle.  BDSM is, uh, wait, wait.  BDSM, uh, Sato.  Bondage, discipline, slave, and master.  Oh, all right.  Well, sorry.  But, uh...  Master!  Go ahead, Scott.  I've been listening to you guys since you came on in Philly.  Yep.  And one of the things that convinced me the most, based on her personality, was when we  had the...  When you had the hedgehog in there, and she'd dive in his drawers. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  Uh, she would do virtually anything for you guys.  Yeah, I know that.  You would have control over her to no end, but the problem is, it's abusive.  Well, that's why...  She needs that.  Well, that's why we had to cut her off, because...  I agree.  I was starting to realize that, yeah, she will do just about anything.  And she's enjoying it.  And Noonan and I, we will take it to the limit.  Well, we would absolutely...  We wanted Bloods and Crips gangbang for Patty.  Well, that would be the happy ending she'd desire. 
[02:38:00]  Stop it, you're hitting me!  It would...  That would be the max.  So, if you want to get rid of her, just be nice.  All right, Scott.  Thank you.  Y'all be good now.  We're getting a lot of...  Y'all be good now.  Y'all are?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Big Kev checking out.  Oh.  Big Kev.  What's up?  What's up, Kev?  Okay.  It was not Moses' brother.  They were placed in the river at the same time.  Moses actually pushed the Dudley Moore baby. 
[02:38:30]  He, his little boat away, and it got picked up by the statue maker down the way.  They were not related.  So, how much power did Dudley Moore have?  Zero.  He thought he had all this power.  He had none.  And he was only like a stepbrother, kind of?  No brother.  No relation.  No relation.  Aha.  That was it.  Leave it to Big Kev to know exactly what the story is.  It's a poor rip-off of The Life of Brian by Monty Python, in my opinion. 
[02:39:00]  You got an IM there, Kev.  Yes, I do.  All right, man.  Take care.  Just sitting in that dark room on the computer.  Here's Big Kev.  I am 6'2", with blonde hair, blue eyes.  I'm 185 pounds.  Would you like to meet somewhere?  Biddle-doo.  Biddle-doo.  I'm a cheerleader.  I'm a senior at the high school.  No more like, I'm a cheerleader.  I'm a senior at high school. 
[02:39:30]  I got luscious boobs.  Sounds hot.  Tell me more.  People still doing that?  It was kind of fun and interesting.  When the Internet really got kicking over, 96, 97, when people would just, and it was a  pain in the ass to even IM and stuff like that, or chat rooms, you'd have to hit refresh  just to get the page to refresh.  You didn't have a scrolling chat that would be going.  You want to go private? 
[02:40:00]  You want to go private?  We'll go private.  Well, do you?  Okay.  Okay.  Go private.  The room will be, and then get in the room.  So, what are you wearing?  Take it off.  Are you jacking?  Wait a minute.  I thought, let's go to the room.  Guys who like to cream.  I'm jacking now.  Wait, I thought you were a chick.  Big Kev.  I'm 6'5", 185.  Yeah, sure you are. 
[02:40:30]  All right, over and out.  It was a pain in the ass to chat back then, or trade pictures.  I'm in the middle of sets.  I'm working out in my basement.  Yeah.  Why don't you give me your phone number, and I'll call you, and we can talk a lot.  This computer thing is so stupid.  Why don't I call you?  I'm Big Kev.  I'm wearing just little cotton shorts working out. 
[02:41:00]  Would you like to call me now so I can describe my body in more detail to you?  Hmm.  My friends have called me the golden Adonis.  That's how it used to be.  They call me Big Kev because I'm packing.  That's the real reason.  Yeah.  Awful.  They'd have been on AOL, or they'd have a bunch of those rooms. 
[02:41:30]  I have not gone on AOL in centuries.  But they used to, uh...  You are horrible.  I'm not even going to say that.  You're a nasty man that's going to get us into even more trouble.  Yeah.  That's still a very top story on CNN and Fox and everything.  We finally have an age limit on this show.  How dare you mention that?  How dare you mention that?  Isaac has to remind us that, uh, yeah, the new hot thing is checking out chicks on their webcams, which is true. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, but that was going on for a while.  Remember, um, remember the Jenny cam?  She was, like, the first one.  Her cam stunk.  Dude, she got all commercial is what happened.  She would...  It was good at the beginning.  No, it wasn't.  It was, too.  It was totally hype.  She...  You had to make sure things were happening.  This is you on the Jenny cam after spending $19.95 for your month.  Ooh, ooh, peek-a-boo.  I never spent money.  She gave you nothing.  I didn't pay the money.  It was before...  It was pay, I'm talking. 
[02:42:30]  If you were lucky, she'd walk out of the shower completely naked and...  Right.  And you'd get a quick shot before she got to her robe.  That was it.  Best shot to her when she was, uh, laying on the bed asleep, but had kicked the covers off because it was all hot in her room.  And she was laying there with only, like, one foot and her elbow covered with the blanket.  Just completely nude.  And this was before she went commercial and went pay.  It was just for her own S's and giggles, as they say.  And then there were the other ones, the, uh, the sweetness cam.  Remember her? 
[02:43:00]  I love the sweetness cam.  She was...  She was pretty fat, but...  Pretty fat.  But she still had youth on her side.  Yeah, she had youth on her side.  You ever notice that about fat ladies?  Mm-hmm.  If they have youth on their side, it's not as bad.  You don't give up yet.  And then she, uh, got to be friends of the show, as far as phone calls went.  And she would paint, uh, Opie and Anthony on her boobs and ample belly.  She did everything on her cam.  Yeah, she had toys.  All kinds of things were going on.  And that, again, was free.  You just had to make sure.  During the show, we'd run out and, uh, run all the way to the back of the building where the computer was and punch it up. 
[02:43:30]  All right, she naked.  We went to the computer room back then.  Yeah, the computer room.  When there was one computer.  One big computer.  Sucked.  But that was, like, cool stuff back then.  Now, I don't even know.  I couldn't even tell you how to have any kind of Internet sex online.  You don't know who's doing it or anything.  No, because these ass wipes wrecked it for all of us, man.  Killing people?  No, I mean.  No, no, no, no.  I mean, uh, the early days of the Internet, it was like, you described the Internet perfectly when you said, uh, a few years back, it was like the wild, wild west. 
[02:44:00]  The wild west.  But you know what?  Now they're starting to organize little cities and towns, and I don't like it.  There used to be so much free porn on the Internet.  Right.  Now it's just a nightmare.  And if you're brave enough to click on one of those stupid, uh, you know, uh, ads or whatever, you're done.  You're done.  Pop-up windows.  They reset your homepage.  It says right here, free pics.  I'm going for it.  Put in your favorites. 
[02:44:30]  A half hour after you leave the computer, a pop-up will come up.  Like, wait, I love big natural boobs.  And it says free pics right here.  I got to click on this one.  Click.  Gay black men A-sex.  And then you're screwed.  You're like, what happened?  What happened to the girl?  I clicked on a girl, and now I got that gay A-sex site.  I swear, that's how it happened.  That's what I'm telling the authorities.  But, uh, back when the Internet was first kicking up, it was, uh, people were just thrilled to death to have it and to have a forum to put their crap up there. 
[02:45:00]  Mm-hmm.  So it wasn't, uh, paid for.  You didn't have to pay for it.  They didn't trick you in and then have to pay for something.  It was free.  Now, anything you click on, no matter how many times I put the word free on it, uh, you have to put your credit card in.  For some reason.  It's totally free.  But, yeah.  Put your credit card number in this sleazy Internet suck site.  All right.  Do it now. 
[02:45:30]  And then they got the pop-ups.  You don't even know how to close them anymore.  Those have gotten ridiculous.  Thank God for Steve C.  And Ad Aware.  I am a real, uh, strong advocate of Ad Aware.  You run this on your system every so often.  It shows the little cookies that they put in place that makes these pop-up ads come up.  No matter if you're on one of their sites or not.  You can be anywhere.  I was having a conniption at my house.  I'm going to normal websites, not porn ones.  I occasionally do that.  And no matter what you click on, the same slut would just pop up and, you know, uh, uh. 
[02:46:00]  And it turned out to be some kind of program that's running on your computer all the time that just pops these ads up.  But Ad Aware.  Thanks to Steve C.  He got rid of them.  Ugh.  Speaking of, uh.  Lady Di.  Disgusting.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hi.  How are ya?  How are ya?  How's everything?  Uh, we'll talk to you next.  All right?  Just stay there.  Hold on.  Okay.  See what she's up to today.  She's feeling the pressure because, uh, Friday's the day that we decide. 
[02:46:30]  Well, no, she'll do her thing and then we'll have the listeners decide if she should stay on the show or not.  You notice, uh, Norton knows everything about internet sex and stuff like that.  He cannot be anywhere without his laptop.  He goes into hotel rooms when we go on road trips.  He's got to be alone.  He closes the curtains, pops his laptop, and just jacks.  I don't know what the hell he does.  But here is a guy who is a technology retard.  He knows nothing about anything with a wire in it.  Yet, he is uploading pictures of his junk like he's Bill Gates on the computer. 
[02:47:00]  He's taking pictures of his junk with a digital camera and uploading them to girls on websites.  These are the places that I don't even know where they exist or what the hell's happening.  But Norton's junk is, uh, a very big feature.  So I guess if I want to know anything, I ask Norton.  He knows.  All right.  I'm just distracted, lady dying.  Great.  More dopey links. 
[02:47:30]  Hey, Anthony, also, uh, Mistress Electra and Mistress, uh, Rhiannon?  Another Mistress Rhiannon, right?  Right.  The other Mistress Rhiannon's the one that blows up her own boobs.  I mean, you know, makes them bigger and smaller, bigger and smaller, depending on what function she has.  Like, if she goes home for Thanksgiving, she makes them smaller.  She's going out effing, she makes them bigger.  It's not that one.  No.  It has always been my dream to wipe out all of the world's diseases, but I believe that I will focus mainly on the ones that itch my crotch.

Man, we're playing catch-up all day long today.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll try to do more than five minutes of radio here before we play more commercials. 
[03:03:30]  We got a little backed up during the staple segment.  And what a fine segment that was.  How's your leg, man?  It's tingly.  It's a little tingly.  I like this Lanacane stuff.  It's nice, right?  Yeah.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Reno, who has signed on with the Opie and Anthony program this week.  866-277-4WOW if you're outside of New York.  And the surrounding areas. 
[03:04:00]  All right, Lady Di.  The big day is coming Friday.  Yes, how you doing?  Okay, how are you?  Oh, God.  Are you there?  Opie, how is your leg?  I heard about the staple session over there.  I try so hard to get involved with everything.  I heard the show.  I heard the show before.  How is everything going?  Lady Di, let me talk.  Go ahead.  You don't have to talk every two seconds.  Okay.  It's called a setup in the radio biz.  I'm going to set the whole thing up here.  Okay.  So shut your trap. 
[03:04:30]  All right?  It's shut.  No, it's not.  Are you going to be quiet?  Going to be quiet?  Mm-hmm.  No, you just be quiet.  Yeah.  So just be quiet, okay?  All right, the big day is coming for Lady Di, Anthony.  Will she stay or will she go?  Well, that's up to her and the listeners.  That's right.  She's going to have to come up with some idea, some event that she wants to do, be part of, 
[03:05:00]  a demonstration, a stunt, something, anything that she believes our listeners are going to  listen to on this show and go, wow, she's adding something to the Opie and Anthony show.  Every once in a while, some of these people that are associated with our show, they've got  to kind of re-up.  Yeah, they should do this in Hollywood.  They've got to re-up.  A lot of people in Hollywood, they made movies years ago, but for some reasons, they're still  around.  Tom Arnold? 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  He's still a celebrity.  He's still around.  Hollywood should get together and make him re-up.  Re-up.  See if he's worthy or not.  And if he's not, then he gets out of town.  We've got to make room for maybe new people that want to come in and contribute things to  this program.  And we've got to get the old wood out.  And Lady Di's been getting a free ride for a really long time.  Her best friend, Marion, is a lot of fun and we enjoy Marion and she's going nowhere,  but we might be saying goodbye to her pal, Lady Di.  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  And that's where we're at today.  Trim the hedges.  So Friday, Lady Di's coming in to do something hopefully crazy and off the hook where our listeners  will go, all right, all right, that was good.  She can stay around for a while.  It's like, all right, that's bad.  That's good.  Until she has to re-up again, we'll let her stay.  All right.  So Lady Di.  Yes?  Where are we at today?  Well, I still have the bit about singing.  The serenading.  She's calling it a bit.  Well, not exactly a bit, but that's what I still have right now. 
[03:06:30]  You didn't add anything else to it?  Oh, boy.  You're in trouble.  What else do you want me...  Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I'm going to explain something.  That's my thing.  I'm going to explain something to everyone else out there.  Okay.  Anthony and I hate when you guys go, well, what do you want me to do?  Yeah.  No, okay, all right, I got you.  I got you.  This is something that I have to come up with.  And you've come up so far with, you're going to dress in a nice dress.  Right.  And put makeup on and get a... 
[03:07:00]  Which I usually do anyway.  Get a hairdo.  Right.  Go to the parlor and get a hairdo.  Mm-hmm.  And then you're going to serenade Jim Norton.  Right.  And what was that song again, that awful song you were singing yesterday?  Yeah, what was that?  That's not an awful song.  That's always and forever.  Oh, yeah, okay.  It's not an awful song.  Was that the song your prom date dumped you to?  No.  No.  Left your ass walking home? 
[03:07:30]  Lady Di, you know what?  No, my song was, looks like we made it.  That was my song.  But I'm trying to come up with other things right now.  Looks like most of us made it.  Well, I made it.  Looks like we made it home.  Her date said, get out.  Yeah.  Looks like we made it.  We're home, get out.  And don't let my friends see me.  Oh, jeez.  Looks like we made it through the night, thank God.  Oh, boy.  Lady Di.  I have to come up with something.  What?  You know I hate you, right? 
[03:08:00]  You hate me?  Yeah.  But I'm going to...  Why do you hate me?  I'm going to try to help you out here.  Ah, what a guy.  Your idea stinks.  And you're giving the listeners no choice.  They will be kicking you off the show.  Yeah.  Ah.  Give me a little heads up.  This is a little reconnaissance.  We've put the feelers out with your last idea, and you don't have a chance.  They hate your song.  They hate your idea.  Looks like you're off the show.  Well, how about if I try something else? 
[03:08:30]  I don't know what else to try.  I really don't know.  You've had now quite a while to think about this.  Two more days.  Nothing?  You have nothing?  There was a listener that came up with a really funny idea.  What's that?  Goddamn, that one is key, and I will find your name and give you credit.  You know what?  No, wait.  I got a twist to it.  Okay.  What is it?  Shut up.  All right.  You have Marion do the first part of it, and Lady Di do the second part.  And if Lady Di completes the second part, she stays. 
[03:09:00]  That could be funny.  That's pretty good, and it also makes Marion see how loyal she is.  We get to see if she's a loyal friend to have to help out Lady Di.  If Marion's listening, she's got to call the show right now.  All right.  With that said, Anthony, here's the idea.  Go ahead.  A big plaster cast.  Now, this would be the Marion idea?  Yeah.  Okay, we'll run with it this way.  Marion makes a plaster cast of her ass. 
[03:09:30]  We fill it with chocolate pudding, and you have to eat it all.  That's a mouthful.  I don't think so.  Why?  And you got the whole show to, you know, eat all this pudding.  You know what?  Preferably on your hands and knees.  I don't think so.  Why?  I don't think, no.  No, we would not go for that.  There's no we.  We.  What's this we?  All you're doing is eating a lot of pudding. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, my God.  It's not going to be dirty pudding.  There's no reach for you.  Jesus.  I don't think so, guys.  I'm not really sure, but I don't think so.  Oh, nervous laughter.  What's wrong with that idea?  There's a lot wrong with that idea.  What?  What's wrong with the idea?  Well, first of all, she would not do that.  How about a plaster cast of your ass, and you have to eat the pudding.  It's all you, then.  Well, you know, I mean, that's something you have to talk to Marion about. 
[03:10:30]  Lady Di, you're fat.  People expect you to eat.  It's not that big of a deal.  Did you come up with this?  Who came up with this?  Does this matter?  Look, if Marion won't do it, would you make a plaster cast of your ass?  We'll have all the materials here for you to do it.  We let it dry, and we fill it with pudding, and you eat chocolate pudding out of your own ass cast.  All day long.  I don't know.  And if you complete it by seven, well, then it's still up to the listeners. 
[03:11:00]  Can I still talk to Marion about this?  What?  Now we're offering you a thing where she's not.  She's been the bestest of friends for so many years.  She hates you.  She does not hate me.  She's a big star on this show, and, you know, some people got to be tossed to the wayside.  She does not hate me, guys.  Come on, guys.  I'm sure Brad Pitt had regular friends before he made it.  Right.  Now what do they do?  They go around going, I knew Brad Pitt.  Right.  What an a-hole.  Brad Pitt.  It's going to be you.  I'm sure Cindy Crawford had her cute high school. 
[03:11:30]  What does Brad Pitt have to do with this?  Cindy Crawford had her cute high school friends that she kept in touch with.  Oh, my God.  There comes a time you've got to cut the ties.  They talk and titter by the lockers.  Oh, little titters coming out of their mouth.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And then she makes it, and, you know, she can't be looking back at everybody that she grew up with.  That's what Marion's like.  She's become a pretty big celebrity on this show.  No, she's, no.  Listen to me.  What?  She's my best friend. 
[03:12:00]  Okay?  And, you know, you can't, you just can't do that.  Let's do it!  What kind of thing is that?  Huh?  I can't help it.  She's got a lot of heat as far as the show goes.  Heat.  The listeners love her.  I know the listeners love her.  They absolutely love her.  And I love her, too.  Look at Gomez.  She's my best friend.  Gomez from D.C.  Can we kick the bitch off now?  See, they're not, they're not very open to these ideas.  I will come up with something for the show.  Lady Di, you're running out of time.  We will try to come up with something for the show.  You're running out of time.  You're running out of time. 
[03:12:30]  We just gave you a great idea.  I know we're running out of time.  We have until Friday to be up there.  We gave you a great idea.  And now you're getting picky.  The plaster cast with the pudding.  And Andrew on line 10 is saying, nothing short of decapitation will get my vote.  Oh, my God.  That is unbelievable.  All right.  Well, we'll talk about it.  And we'll come up with something.  Now Earl is yelling at us.  Another Earl saying, cannot let this go on.  Make her come up with her own ideas. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, see, we're already.  Even our listeners are coming up with better ideas than you.  And they don't have to spend 24 hours thinking about it.  Well, how about the serenading?  What was so bad with that?  Serenading?  That's stupid.  No one wants to look at your big, bloated tomato face as you sing to Jim Norton.  Wonderful.  Is Jim there right now?  Your face is so bloated from alcohol.  You look Chinese.  My face is, this is the way my face is.  What are you going to do?  We saw the old pictures of you. 
[03:13:30]  And?  Well, the alcohol was taken home.  That was when I was younger.  You're pickled at this point.  I'm pickled at this point.  The skin under your eyes, the cheeks, they're so fat now that you've got thin little Asian eyes.  Well, there are things I could do about that.  You know that, right?  Yeah, it's called stop drinking.  Oh, my God.  Stop eating.  It's called AA.  It's called AA.  She repeats everything you say.  Oh, man.  Well, Lady Di, the clock is ticking. 
[03:14:00]  And I will think of something.  Good luck, my friend.  Three days to go.  Three days.  Bye-bye.  So, just a lost cause.  She could come in with test tubes, Bunsen burners, and make the cure for AIDS right here on the show.  Just whip it up in a goddamn blender.  And make a cure for AIDS.  And you know what people would say?  Off. 
[03:14:30]  Get off the show.  Not good enough.  I just think he hates her.  I can just tell.  If she waved her hand and Christopher Reeve started walking.  Off.  But she's, honestly, she's not as bad as Patty.  I think there are two different things.  It's like the gunshot wound to the heart or the head.  Like, Di asks you questions about yourself.  Patty tells you everything about herself.  Yeah.  What do you want to hear? 
[03:15:00]  It's true.  Who cares?  Sam Levine is here, Anthony.  I see.  Well, hello, boys.  Hello.  Hello.  You might remember him from Freaks and Geeks.  Of course.  He was in the building and decided to stop by and say hi.  You were in that other movie that came out recently.  What the hell was that?  That was not another teen movie.  Not another teen movie?  You were in that scene that was like The Breakfast Club.  Yeah.  I can't believe we got to shoot that.  I'm sure we broke some laws.  Some copyright violation.  Yeah.  And it had the same guy in it.  Yeah.  Paul Gleason.  Yeah.  What a sport.  The principal dude.  Was that a good movie?  I never saw it, but I saw the ads for it. 
[03:15:30]  It looked cool.  It looked funny.  Sam's shaking his head down.  I don't know.  I'm shaking no one saying yes.  Admit that you were in a movie that stunk because no one in Hollywood will ever do that.  Oh, I have a movie coming out that sucks.  How's that?  Is that better?  It may never even come out.  It's called After School Special.  It's about three high school guys who make a porno.  That sounds interesting.  It sounds good.  Really?  But it isn't.  They didn't go the distance with it?  No.  What's the problem with it?  PG?  So many.  PG-13.  How do you do that with PG-13?  How do you do it?  It should be X. 
[03:16:00]  And just have you guys just plowing away.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  I don't know.  Make a real porno?  Well, you could do that.  There's an idea.  That one kid did that from The Toy.  Scotty James.  Yeah.  There's a real one.  Remember that guy from The Toy?  Yeah.  And a couple other movies he was in.  Well, that's right.  Okay.  And he went porno.  Yeah.  They did an true Hollywood story on him.  He went real bad, that guy.  Oh, my God.  He went real bad.  That's just the big slip right off the edge. 
[03:16:30]  You're gone never to return to Hollywood.  I played poker with one of the guys who directed him in one of the films he did.  Really?  Yeah.  He says, I swear to God, Scotty James is sitting on the script for The Toy 2.  Not kidding.  He wrote it.  And he's waiting.  No one will buy it.  And he's waiting.  He's waiting.  He's waiting for that to be picked up.  Somebody's going to buy it.  I know.  It's called Sex Toy 2.  Yeah.  That is sad.  Men's of the dildo.  Look who else we have in the studio right now.  Did you get friendly with the ladies outside, Sam?  We had some time to chat. 
[03:17:00]  I can't believe we wasted time talking to Lady Di when we had these beautiful women that  are willing to do...  You've hurt our feelings.  I'm sorry.  We're mistresses.  We don't like to be kept waiting.  Yes, mistresses.  You dominate men, don't you?  Yes, we do.  Yes.  You bring them to their knees.  You tie them up.  Is that what you do?  We buy them.  You beat them, silly.  We thank them.  We beat them.  Yeah.  Would you like to hear what else we do?  We get the only raunch here.  Look at the expression on his face.  You know what, though?  Sam, you're not into that stuff.  I'm afraid not. 
[03:17:30]  I'm a reconvenient guy.  He's never going to admit it on the air, but he looks like the kinky type to me.  Really?  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  We have our first dump of you girls being in here, and it's only been 45 seconds.  Oh.  So that's going to be great.  Yeah.  Let me...  I'll just explain a little bit.  You think he's into the mule yam bag torture?  See, we use code words.  Oops.  Mule.  Mule.  And yam bag.  It's like a bag of yams.  You know what, though?  You're okay.  And the mule is like, you know, it's just a big... 
[03:18:00]  No, no.  You know, Anto?  Yeah.  The yam bags have to be part of the mule.  No.  Yes.  No.  The whole thing is junk.  People have sent me pics of the junk, and you need the yam bags to pull off the mule effect.  What does the yam bag make of the mule?  It's kind of the jowls of the mule.  The jowly face of the mule.  I just thought it was a term.  No, I'm telling you.  He has no mule ears.  He has no...  So, the mule...  And what are the code words for the female nether region? 
[03:18:30]  All right.  Okay.  There's a couple of those.  Which one would you like to know first?  One for you.  What's your favorite?  Well, my favorite expression on this show, and it was...  My brother came up with this one.  A balloon nut.  Well, that's the back area.  That's the reverse region.  Look how confused they are.  Now, if you were practicing...  That's a traumatized area.  Wait.  You know what?  Why don't we do a little...  A little show and tell.  Are you guys willing to get naked? 
[03:19:00]  Of course.  All right.  One of you has to get naked, and we will point out all the areas and their appropriate  names.  Wow.  Wow.  You know, that black shirt is so deceiving.  You were hiding some lovely, lovely...  This is Tyson and this is Lewis.  Oh, is that it?  It is on.  Look at Garrett.  It is on.  The twins are very friendly.  I see.  Look at that.  Those are double D's at least.  Double D's.  36 double D?  He knows his boobs.  Wow.  I picked the right day. 
[03:19:30]  God.  Yeah, you did.  And I also could guess your age by doing a little something something.  But before we get there, because we have so much to do with you lovely ladies, we want  to use...  Can you get completely naked?  Can you see?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Well, go around there, because we'll point out different areas and tell you the code  word for them.  God, I wish you were around when I was in school.  Just get naked.  There it is.  All right.  No, no, no.  Get the other girl over here.  We're going to point out stuff.  It's not the other girl.  It's the other mistress.  The other mistress. 
[03:20:00]  What's your name?  You bastard.  Sorry, mistress.  Hey, is that natural hair color?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's very nice.  It matches your head, though.  All right, turn around.  Okay, bend.  Bend over.  See that.  No, no.  Now, like, do this.  Yeah, do that.  Now, see that.  See that?  That's a starfish.  That's...  Well, it could be starfish.  Oh, look.  See that?  What does that look like?  It looks like a lot of things.  A balloon knot.  A balloon knot.  It looks like a balloon knot. 
[03:20:30]  You ever...  Now, if you blow up...  Wait, if you...  Sam's with me.  If you blow up a balloon, right?  Here, show her again.  Show her again.  If you blow up a balloon...  Do we have a balloon where we can compare the two?  It's exactly like a balloon knot.  And then you tie the balloon in a knot, and then you look into where you just blew into?  Oh, I see a two.  Right.  Okay, so that's the balloon knot.  Not the knot itself, unless you've got something popping out.  Now, the other thing...  You see this?  Now, do that.  Yeah, do a little of that.  Yeah.  We like to call that...  That's beautiful, by the way. 
[03:21:00]  We like to call that either the peach or the whale's eye.  The whale's eye.  Because if you ever see a whale breaching their eye, when they look back and they're like,  where's the krill?  Yeah, because they got like...  The whales have like four or five different eyelids.  They got like all kinds of eyelids going on.  Yeah.  Get back on the mic, because no one can hear you.  You're beautiful, by the way.  Yes.  So that's the whale's eye, the peach.  And the other thing with the whale...  And the whale strings plankton through its baleen. 
[03:21:30]  All right?  So we're talking code here.  Okay.  And those could be any terms aside from the ones that start with T, because they are really...  Okay.  Melons?  Melons.  Okay.  Melons.  Now...  Melons it is.  What is the code word for the F word?  Ah.  Very good.  There's plenty of those.  You could call it plowing.  You could call it ramming.  You could call it...  I like the horizontal bop myself. 
[03:22:00]  Things like that.  Be creative without using that F word.  Horizontal is a word.  Yeah.  Well, it's...  You know what it is?  It's kind of a game.  You've got to kind of be a little creative as far as how you say things.  We're radio virgins, the both of us.  And the guys, the C is like, you know, that word is no, no.  Mule.  Very good.  Milkshake.  Milkshake.  You could call it a milkshake.  Sure.  That's really after you've been with it for a while.  Right.  After you're shaking for a while.  Or else it's just an empty milkshake cup. 
[03:22:30]  And then yam bag.  I think we have all the regions spelt out.  And now we can talk accordingly.  I see you've got rope there.  And you've got...  We have rope.  Something to spank people with.  We've got a paddle and we've got a very, very big whip.  Yeah.  Very big.  So we're going to do some stuff?  You want to do stuff to our...  No.  Don't even suggest it.  No, we have our own John.  We're going to give you a few minutes where we'll actually allow people to volunteer. 
[03:23:00]  And if nobody volunteers, then we will be picking the victims ourselves.  All right, John will be volunteering.  Yeah, we'll get John off the phones.  John's going to come in.  Here he is.  Look at him.  Wow, that didn't take any time at all.  What are we going to do?  It's a very good sport.  And what are we going to do to John today?  I'd like to take off his pants first.  Ugh.  Like all...  You know that this is great for bikini waxes?  Duct tape?  Duct tape, yes.  How about that?  It's just about...  Can I...  A little helpful hint. 
[03:23:30]  We can fix that.  Ooh.  You're going to do that to John?  John, you've got to take off his pants first.  Look at John.  No, no, no.  Okay, okay.  We took staples today.  Okay, John, how about nipples?  Can we do that?  No, no.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  They get...  You know, the word is okay, but used in any context, they have a problem with it.  Oops.  So, uh...  What are you doing here?  So, um...  I don't know.  Just call it his...  Gumdrops?  Chest.  Goat hangers?  That's not good at all.  On his chest.  Anthony?  Okay, chest.  Those round things on his chest.  You know the power only comes...  How about we do when you describe? 
[03:24:00]  Comes to me every once in a while.  Yes, Opie, I know.  I understand.  Are you getting it?  I'm getting the power today.  And I would love to tell the redhead her age.  I'm going to...  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  I'm going to clean his glasses first.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my goodness.  She is cleaning the glasses.  I don't know.  That might streak.  Really?  All right.  Now, he not only sees better, but smells better.  Ah, there you go. 
[03:24:30]  So, what are we going to do to John today?  All right.  They're taking John's shirt off.  They're taking his shirt off.  Oh, hot.  Oh, then.  Are you wearing boxers?  They're taking the pants down.  Thank God.  Thank God he doesn't have tighty-whities on.  Too bad you're not wearing your capris today, John.  Yeah, that would have been great.  Oh, those are gap boxers.  Nice.  Hey, he's got the gap boxers on.  And, oh, he's being...  Ow!  Oh.  John!  Put the mic by John's face.  Yeah, get that other mic over there.  No, good.  Keep that mic there.  There you go.  Can I have more? 
[03:25:00]  We got a couple mistresses in the studio.  John, how does that feel?  That freaking hurts.  Yeah.  Yes, but...  That means we're doing a good job.  Yes, it...  Ow!  Thank you, mistress.  Can I have more?  Thank you, mistress.  Can I have more?  Ow.  Ow.  Take it like a man, John.  Ow.  Ow.  Are you a sissy or a man?  I'm a man.  He's a sissy.  He's a total sissy.  All right.  Uh-oh, the whip.  I get red so fast, John.  He needs...  She needs a little room.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  All right.  Listen to this scream.  Oh, God. 
[03:25:30]  Ow.  Ow.  Jesus.  Man goes...  Jesus.  I think it's welting right now.  Hey, can we get Earl in here for them to do this, too?  That would be interesting to watch.  A little bit?  First time in 40, 50 years.  I was just getting a cichlid.  That looks like it hurt, John.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  John, turn around.  Let me see your back.  Well, not yet.  Pull your goddamn boxes up.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Hey, John, put your goddamn boxes back in. 
[03:26:00]  There are about one or two hits from blood, Ant.  Yeah.  All right.  John is now seated in a chair.  Do the duct tape.  I see duct tape coming.  I see a towel is rolled up like they're going to blindfold him.  I'm going to gag him with my panties.  Ew.  Don't make him puke.  Ew.  He'll gag.  All right.  You're going to do the duct tape?  But we want to hear him scream, though.  Well, he's going to have to go, oh.  Oh, my God.  They're tying him up like the gimp.  Have you ever seen a few good men?  Isn't this how the movie began? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  I was thinking more like Reservoir Dogs.  Yeah.  Or the gimp.  Yeah.  Or the gimp.  The gimp's sleeping.  From Pulp Fiction there.  I guess you better wake him up, then.  Look at that.  John is having a towel duct taped around his face.  He's got her panties in his mouth.  He's turning red.  You know, since he can't talk right now, I guess I'm going to have to give away.  What are they doing?  Yeah.  John has this one. 
[03:27:00]  Hold on.  I'll explain.  John is hairless except for this one silly little patch.  A little tuft.  In between.  In the middle of his chest.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  And they're duct taping and they're going to pull it out.  Oh, Jesus.  It's going to hurt him so bad.  But we're not going to be able to hear him because he's gagged.  That's okay.  All right.  Ladies, what are you doing?  He's such a good boy.  You ready?  Boom!  Panties in your mind. 
[03:27:30]  Wow!  Oh, my God.  You know what makes it hurt so much worse is that the panties that are in his mouth right  now, they were taken off for a very good reason.  Oh!  You don't have any clothespins laying around, do you?  What was the expression you used before that you took your panties off for?  Aromatherapy.  You were on what?  What were you on?  On the...  On the rack.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't know if they let that go through.  I will say that she is having a special time that every girl experiences every month, and  that's why her panties...  Not the whole world now.  That's why her panties came off.  And they're in...  That's okay.  They smell nice, don't they?  See, again, it's all in the mind.  No, no.  No, that's more than...  More than the mind. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, she's beating him.  Oh, my God.  She's beating him with one of her melons.  Now, both of them.  Left, right.  Oh, my God.  He's being pummeled about the face with both melons.  Stop the fight.  Stop the fight.  Oh, my God.  I'll take my hand off to you.  Down goes Tyson.  Ah.  Tasty John.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  As a final treat.  Oh, boy.  A final treat.  One more piece of duct tape.  Oh, I don't want to watch this.  Jeez, they're pulling the front of his box. 
[03:29:00]  I don't want to see this.  All right, John.  Just take it for the team, John.  Boy, John will take it for the team.  He's going to be a horsey.  Mr. Selector will not ride him.  No, no.  I want to hear more pain.  I'll take the vaccine.  Pain.  We want to hear more pain.  More pain.  More pain.  Pain.  Physical, not emotional.  Pain.  We'll get to emotional.  Pain.  Pain.  Pain.  Okay, what am I doing?  But this is the humiliation and degradation.  Okay, now, now be none of that.  None at all, really.  All right, calm down, girls. 
[03:29:30]  Good job on the block, Rick.  All right, they are now riding John.  John's cursing.  He has a rope in his mouth as a bit, and he's being ridden around.  Turn him around there, Rick.  Get him in that open area.  John, you know this is being videotaped from Foundry Music and any aspirations you might have  for a political career to become completely dead.  Join the club.  Gone.  Don't worry.  All of our political careers are ruined. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  I wonder how many...  He's riding around.  I wonder how many well-known political careers she's actually ruined.  I just want to hear a little more pain.  Oh!  Oh!  There you go.  You're beating the crap out of my love.  Oh, my God.  What do you think?  I'm just happy it's not me.  Yes?  As much pain as he's getting, he's also getting lots of pleasure because...  Really?  I don't know if it's all of you.  I'm not wearing any.  Oh! 
[03:30:30]  Oh!  There you go.  A little bareback riding.  There's no saddle involved.  Yes!  Oh!  So he's getting a treat as he's getting.  Looks like it.  Nice.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  All right, John.  You look ridiculous.  A man in your position cannot afford to be made to look ridiculous.  And you look ridiculous.  All right, how about we end with a little more pain?  Oh, no.  A little more pain. 
[03:31:00]  I like that duct tape thing.  One more duct tape.  Without the gag in the mouth.  Yeah.  But, mistress, your shoes, they need cleaning.  Oh, I know.  We know the shoes.  This old gag.  Go right back to the duct tape.  We're here walking in this cage.  All right, John.  Oh, my God.  Do what they say.  Come on.  You're a good boy.  Get on your knees.  Go ahead, Josh.  Look at poor John.  Oh, my God.  What's your name?  Marvin.  Marvin.  Marvin Nash.  Marvin Nash. 
[03:31:30]  Hold on, Marvin.  I'm deformed here.  They took my ear.  I'm deformed here.  Marvin Nash.  And a toy.  Oh, yeah.  Great.  You can take the ear off.  It's great.  It comes with a razor.  Hold on, ladies.  We're not really listening to you.  All right.  Okay.  What's going on over there now?  He's shining my shoes with his tongue.  Oh, of course. 
[03:32:00]  He can fake it?  We don't fake it.  No, we don't like faking it.  No, we don't like faking things.  So do it for real.  Yeah.  He's shining my shoes with his tongue, and he's licking my beautiful red shirt.  Could you hit him in the back of the head with a ball-peen hammer?  Knock some sense into him.  Stephen, what's up?  Grandma.  Hello?  Real fast.  Stephen, go.  Oh, man.  I leave my grandma in the car.  We fight about the radio all the time.  I leave this on the car to go to the supermarket.  I get back.  She's so pissed.  I have no clue what she's tipped about. 
[03:32:30]  She's like, what are you listening to?  She's so mad.  She leaves the car.  She won't get back in the car with me.  Your grandma.  She's walking down the street on Hempstead.  She's not getting back in the car.  Nice.  Wait, hold on.  Grandma.  Oh.  Wait, there's more.  Oh, man.  Wow.  That one, like, hit his face.  Are you guys going to give him a little pleasure, too, or just?  Yeah, what about some pleasure for the poor?  The pain is the pleasure.  No, maybe for you guys.  Yeah, yeah.  You got to.  That's what you boys don't understand about S&M. 
[03:33:00]  Can you duct tape more of that silly hair off his chest?  Does he have any on his shoulder?  No.  Hairless boy, yes.  Wow.  Oh, dear.  Ow.  They're individually pulling hairs out of his chest.  A little more duct tape.  They're out of ideas.  There it is.  A little more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you can tell.  When they individually tweeze his chest.  Oh.  You all right, John?  Oh, that's your big baby.  What's wrong? 
[03:33:30]  He's a big baby.  Let's lay him down and tie him up like a good boy.  Yeah.  Why don't you tie him up?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Here come the ropes.  Hey, ladies.  Can you, uh...  It's called the Chandra Levy they're giving him now.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Yeah.  I'll be honest.  Yeah.  What are you ladies doing over there?  We're tying him to the chair.  Hey, Rick, talk to the ladies.  Just talk to the ladies.  Describe what they're doing.  Yeah.  Rick, just describe.  All right.  Well, right now...  Off the mic a little bit, you tool.  A little bit.  One of our mistresses has got his hands behind his back. 
[03:34:00]  We'll have to tie John up really, really good.  Yeah.  We're almost at a show.  And then just leave him here.  Just leave him here for the run.  If that's...  That's a good idea.  Nowhere to run until they get ready for the last thing that they're going to do.  Is this going to be the last thing you're going to do to them, girls?  Uh-huh.  I'm thinking about it.  Just make sure you tie him good.  Don't pussy out because of, you know, he's with the show or anything.  However you want.  Ladies, we want you to tie him up really good.  We want you to gag him.  Do that whole bondage thing that you girls do, you know, where it really goes up his legs. 
[03:34:30]  And I've seen some sick stuff on the internet.  Yeah.  Definitely all we have with us is shoelaces.  Yeah.  We'll use the shoelace.  I have a very prison feel to it.  Yeah.  If you need a shoelace, we'll donate some of ours, okay?  Improvise, adapt, overcome.  I just want you guys to do a really, really good job.  I want to see some of his skin, like, turn purple.  Why?  I don't know.  See, the bondage, the tying up is only just a small part of what it is we do. 
[03:35:00]  That's not really what it is we do.  All about the mind game.  And you take the razor and cut his ear off.  Ladies.  Like, Marvin.  No.  Oven mask.  I'd like to say what it is that we actually do, but I don't know how much of that.  Does it involve the mule?  No.  Ladies.  No.  Human mule.  All right, ladies, we're going to let you explain next, okay?  During the commercials, you've got to tie them up really, really good so we can get  a nice picture for the Internet, okay?  Really work them.  Put the gag in his mouth because we don't want to hear them anymore.  And give them, they're asking for scissors, but make them very blunt. 
[03:35:30]  Safety.  Safety scissors, like in school.  Give them the paste.  All right, when we get back, we'll see, you know, how tied up they can get John.  Right.  And we'll play What Do We Learn?  And we're hanging out with Sam Levine, man.  Hey, yeah.  Are you plugging anything or just hanging?  You can plug.  Don't worry about it.  I got nothing to plug.  Nothing.  You have nothing.  Nothing I'm proud of this week.  Jeff Ross is in L.A. and you have nothing to do.  I have nothing to do if Jeff is in L.A.  He's my gay lover.  It's all over.  Also, I'm feeling the power today. 
[03:36:00]  I really want to guess one of their ages.  Yeah, we will do that.  I don't know if there are four.  I hope he has an amazing talent that we will try to do next.  It's so weird.  I only feel it every once in a while, Anthony.  Sure you do.  Maybe it was aromatically influenced.  Nothing you can imagine has prepared you for this.  I don't want them enjoying it like exactly.
