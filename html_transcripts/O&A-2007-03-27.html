<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about a strong smell in the studio, possibly a fart, involving hosts Opie and Anthony and James Norton.  This segued into Norton’s upcoming Hepatitis testing, a prerequisite set by his girlfriend for a specific sexual act.  The conversation then devolved into a series of vulgar anecdotes about awkward sexual encounters, post-coital cleanup, and unusual bedroom finds. Callers Chris and Lindsay contributed their own experiences, the latter recounting a friend's reaction to simulated bestiality.  A Boston news story about a woman with a distinctive hairstyle being shot provided a brief, jarring interlude before the “Prize Closet” segment awarded a caller a copy of *Sin City*.

A substantial portion of the show centered on the departure of their boss, Joel Hollander, and the return of Dan Mason. They recounted negative past experiences with former boss John Sykes, particularly his perceived cowardice regarding the "Sex for Sam" promotion fallout.  Their underwhelming celebratory dinner with Mason was described as a brief, impersonal exchange, highlighting Mason's contradictory approach – encouraging boundary-pushing while simultaneously warning against jeopardizing the station's license.

Current events, specifically the illness of John Edwards' wife and the death of Anna Nicole Smith, were also discussed.  The hosts detailed the drugs found in Smith's autopsy (chloral hydrate, Klonopin, Valium, Ativan, Benadryl, Soma, Robaxin, Topamax, and Ciprofloxacin, among others), speculating on the circumstances of her death with numerous vulgar and offensive comments about her appearance and lifestyle. A nurse caller clarified the medical use of chloral hydrate. The Subway Superman and his legal troubles were also mentioned.  A lengthy discussion followed regarding a man dumped for a boyfriend who allegedly induced orgasms through mind power alone – Guy Compton becoming a recurring, offensive joke.  The segment included listener calls, prize giveaways (initially an Alec Baldwin SNL compilation, later replaced by a signed copy of *Suicide Kings*), and complaints about the show's guest booking process.

The show transitioned into discussions on self-defense techniques against ATM muggings and ATM scams, followed by email phishing scams.  Caller Rick’s attempt to recount a story about his girlfriend’s orgasm with a strap-on, while avoiding FCC violations, led to much comedic evasion.  He received tickets to see Bob Saget as a reward.  Listener calls followed, including Miranda criticizing the hosts' humor, particularly their use of "Nurse Pig" and negativity towards redheads; Derek recounted his girlfriend's orgasm on a bus; and John also criticized their humor. The death of Kiara Levin, shot in a Boston crossfire, was discussed, followed by a discussion of the “fence plowing” viral video trend.

The show then veered into a chaotic mix of topics: a confused discussion of Marilyn Monroe and baseball, crude commentary on Anna Nicole Smith's genitalia, and a graphic threesome recounted by caller Chris, prompting further explicit anecdotes from Jimmy Norton.  Caller David revealed his Hepatitis C diagnosis and treatment, discussing transmission possibilities.  Dave credited the show for improving his sex life, sparking a discussion about incorporating "a little skank" into relationships.  Liz and her husband Jared called in for advice on spicing up their sex life, leading to a lengthy, extremely explicit conversation involving spanking, biting, verbal abuse, and Liz's body image.  The show concluded with further discussions of the Wii, a viral video of explosive diarrhea in a hot tub, Tony Snow's health, and the Wii's popularity among the elderly.

A segment began with a rejected listener-suggested contest involving mall fountains and moved on to comedian Eddie Griffin crashing a Ferrari. A prank call resulting in an elderly woman suffering a stroke was mentioned, as was a video of an elderly woman being assaulted.  The unexpected firing of Joel Hollander was addressed, causing uncertainty about the future of the show.  A game of “Five Questions” involved guessing the contents of a confiscated 93-pound item – revealed to be stolen lingerie. Finally, a masturbating trespasser incident at a fraternity house, and the subsequent discarding of furniture, was discussed, culminating in the “Line of the Day” segment and a humorous discussion about Opie's need for milk, ending with the announcement of a fictional "Milk Diva" world tour. The entire broadcast was heavily punctuated with vulgar language and sexually explicit content.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  And daylight breaks, creeping through the shadows, an unstoppable force, lays in wait, ready to strike.  Oh my God! Oh Jesus, Jimmy!  I get scared.  I get scared.  Oh God!  Holy mother of God. 
[00:00:30]  Oh boy, please don't.  God damn it.  What the, what?  Oh, it stinks so bad.  Oh my God.  This is killing me. You're killing me.  Uh oh, just fart so we can start the bit.  Oh my God!  I got to show you!  You got to stand here!  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  Oh my God! 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  I'm stumped because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just hoarse.  James Norton.  Look at his face. How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Bagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Bagel.  Oh!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Bagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Stretch one, two.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning!  How are you, Anthony?  Very well.  How are you, Jimmy?  I'd complain, but who'd listen?  I've heard that. 
[00:02:00]  You're about to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Well rested.  Did you get your test results back?  No.  Did you take your test?  Yeah.  Your, what was it, hepatitis?  Yeah, ABC.  It was basics.  Yeah.  The basics of STDs, your ABCs.  Well, you learn your ABCs.  Make sure you don't have them.  Dude, it was the best test experience ever.  Went right over to Quest Diagnostics.  My doctor sent a note.  Well, they do just take some blood, right?  Yeah, and the guy, I was asking for symptoms and stuff.  Was the guy in a space suit when he took your blood? 
[00:02:30]  I know you.  You're Jimmy Norton.  Well, I just got to get into something.  Most people just snap on those little rubber gloves.  He comes in in that outbreak suit that Dustin Hoffman was wearing.  No, he was a black guy.  He threw on a blonde wig and heels.  Yeah, if you weren't listening yesterday, boy, Jimmy dropped a doozy on everyone.  A doozy.  You know, for all of us that are in relationships, yeah, you have a little disagreement here and there. 
[00:03:00]  It might be on just mundane stuff for the most part if you kind of take a step back and think about it.  But not in Jimmy's world.  They had a little disagreement about something Jimmy wants done sexually.  Yeah.  And, well, his lovely, lovely girlfriend decided that she would be open to this if he got tested for hepatitis.  Yeah.  So what does Jimmy do?  He pretty much leaves the second half of the Opie and Anthony show early to go get tested for hepatitis. 
[00:03:30]  Well, the thing he's looking for her to do is very important, very exciting for Jimmy.  He wants to make sure he's safe and his girl is secure in the knowledge that she could do that without any risk of...  It's extremely important in Jimmy's world.  Yeah.  And in our world, not as important.  I'd say it's important in Jimmy's world and when dogs greet each other in that world. 
[00:04:00]  But...  And I think it's very important in prison.  Yeah.  We do talk to a lot of prisoners, so...  Yeah.  I'm sure they can relate a little bit, too.  Oh, you guys are missing out, though.  It rules.  Yeah.  It rules.  I'm telling you, you're just laying there, like, kind of zoning out, like, this is what they feel like when you do this to them.  This is fantastic.  I don't...  I don't know.  It's...  You know something?  It might be a real good feeling, but there's something about putting the girl through that.  That just, like, isn't quite good. 
[00:04:30]  I'll sacrifice that for the girl's sake.  Yeah.  After you're done with your sex, you want some dignity that...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, you want to go back to, like, normalcy very easily.  Yeah, yeah.  You want to be able to kick back, prop your pillows up.  There shouldn't be a grieving period.  There shouldn't be tears.  You don't want to hear... 
[00:05:00]  And Listerine.  Let me uncover...  Just relax.  Just relax.  All right.  Yeah.  There shouldn't be hand-holding where you're like, it'll be okay.  It'll be okay.  Yeah.  That's the thing about sex.  It should be...  There shouldn't be time put aside for clean-up.  Right.  And untying.  Right.  Just things like that.  And just, like, whimpering.  It shouldn't be whimpering.  You guys segue back into your lives after sex.  We have to have, like, a chamber we get into. 
[00:05:30]  Like, we're entering from our...  Like, just a chamber.  Discuss things for a while.  Look, about what happened.  Yeah.  Here's what...  I know.  Look, I'm sorry.  Look.  There's apologies exchanged.  And it'll never happen again.  And maybe thoughts of charges being filed.  We've all kind of been there, though.  You get a little crazy with your sex.  And at the time, it makes perfect sense.  Yeah.  You're all, you know what, you're all just horned up.  You're all frothed up. 
[00:06:00]  So everything makes sense when you're under that state.  Yeah.  And then the act is over.  And then you look around the room.  And there's an embarrassment factor that kind of settles in.  Like, oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  When you have to put things in the dishwasher.  Yeah.  But take your dishes out first.  Yeah, make sure the dishes are out first.  When you have to clean up things.  And you're like, oh, boy.  This is kind of embarrassing now that the...  Now that the passion has passed.  Yeah.  Once certain feelings and things are released, the mindset changes a bit. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And then you feel silly.  You do.  Looking around the bed.  And it's, you know, there's things laying around.  And, you know, all of a sudden there's a blow-up sheep in the room.  You're like, well.  It sounded like a great idea.  I got it for free at work.  I figure, what the hell?  All sorts of disgusting magazines just...  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  ...strawing about.  There's still that video playing on TV that you've got to now hit the stop button with your greasy hand.  That's not a normal video, if you know what I mean.  With your coconut-smelling hand.  It's just...  Oh, what are we going to...  Oh, yeah.  No, this movie could...  Ah!  The movie's still going...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  And you go...  Yeah, we'll pop that out.  Let's put it...  Hey!  I got 23.  Yeah, you're...  Watch that.  Just scrubbing down the walls as the movie's still playing. 
[00:07:30]  There's, like, half-eaten candy products all over the bedroom.  Before you even untie her, you have to hit the movie to stop, because nobody wants to hear...  After the sex is over.  Calm down, boy.  Calm down.  This movie is fun more turned on, but not now.  Let me say hi to Chris in Jersey.  He has a very good question today.  Chris, what's going on?  Hi, guys. 
[00:08:00]  I was just curious.  You know, I'm assuming that you guys are all friends with Jimmy and his girlfriend,  and I'm sure, like, you know, when you say hello, you get the kiss hello, and I'm just  curious that after she goes through this, if you're still going to do that.  No, as we move forward from this day, I will just accept a little handshake.  A handshake?  Is that it?  It's going to get to a point where we're all just waving through glass at each other.  No, that ain't happening. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you, Chris.  Yeah, but that is pretty funny.  Yeah.  I can't even be mad at her.  She's just health conscious.  Yeah.  But anyway, so Jimmy ran to the doctor, was hoping to get the results the same day, found  that, obviously.  You've got to wait a little while, because he was ready to go home yesterday.  Paperwork in hand?  Paperwork in hand as he's getting ready for this special act.  Oh, yeah.  He wasn't going to wait a day.  Not one day.  As a matter of fact, he did say he wanted to take the results and tape them on his lower 
[00:09:00]  back so she could read them and then get right to business.  It's like going to McDonald's.  It's like you want to read the calories and the things right before you eat.  Yeah, so you know what you're getting.  Absolutely.  All right, we got a good phone call here.  We're going to try to work through this.  Lindsay from Boston, what's up?  Hey.  Listening on BCN.  Now, I see what you want to say.  I'll be good.  You've got to be really careful. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, because we kind of know what we're talking about.  Let's see if you're radio savvy on this side of the show.  I'm savvy.  All right, let's go.  My friend was with her boyfriend, and, you know, they were acting like dogs.  All right, good, good, good.  Stay right there.  Good, good.  And something of his slipped into a place.  Right.  And she, the second the impact was made, she threw up and started crying.  That's what you want. 
[00:10:00]  And does she get a passing grade?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I think she did fine.  Al helped us out.  Did you jump out of that?  All right.  I think she did okay.  Hey, that's very funny.  She didn't expect it to be what it was, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Very upsetting.  Is that a shock ref?  Like, someone went into shock in a weird way to throw up like that.  Isn't that kind of like a shock thing?  I don't know.  That's like when you find a finger in your chili at Wendy's.  Yeah.  You just all of a sudden go, bleh.  At one moment, you're just enjoying your chili. 
[00:10:30]  Everything's great.  And then, bleh.  Hey, Lindsay.  Yes.  What is Boston talking about this morning?  I don't know.  The girl.  Yeah, what about the girl?  What about the girl that was in the bad neighborhood?  I have no idea.  Oh, the girl who was visiting from New York?  Yeah.  She had like a Howard Stern poodle hairdo.  That's all I know.  I love our listeners.  That's all I saw on TV, but. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  That's what you're talking about.  Some girl with a Howard Stern poodle hairdo got shot in a really bad neighborhood.  Yeah.  She was in a bad gang neighborhood.  Do you know what neighborhood it was?  What do you think?  Dorchester, right?  Well, there's only one or two bad neighborhoods in all of Boston, so.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm from Dorchester, so.  Oh.  Sorry to hear that.  Wow.  Oh.  How do you leave your house at this point?  No, I'm from what's called the good pot, a.k.a.  The white pot.  So you gotta love Boston.  A.k.a. 
[00:11:30]  The white pot.  Boston is, we've been to a lot of cities.  They still have it all figured out.  Yep.  The Jews are over here.  The Irish are over here.  The Blacks are over here.  The Italians are over here.  Yeah.  I mean, it's all segregated.  We all live together in one gray city.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Of Boston.  Just don't go where the gangs are.  All right.  Sit up a little, you get rocks thrown at buses, and people might die.  Who knows?  All right. 
[00:12:00]  Thank you, Lindsay.  Wait, wait, wait.  I have an idea for Lindsay.  All right.  What?  She was a good caller.  Yeah?  I say.  Well, we do have the O.P. and Anthony Prize Closic.  Oh, no.  Stop it.  Oh, jeez.  Lindsay, we're just going to give you something, because you gave us a good phone call today.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  What do you want to give her?  Don't give her the obvious.  No.  All right.  You know what?  Don't give her the Lucky Louie season one DVD.  Oh, no.  I'm going to take that and sell it on the road.  Oh, she already has it, too.  Good.  That's mine.  I'm going to make money off that.  All right.  What are you going to give her from this unbelievable prize closet? 
[00:12:30]  Yes.  Have you seen Boogie Nights?  Yes.  Good, because you're not seeing it this way.  We're going to give you two copies, one copy of Frank Miller's Sin City.  That's a good movie.  Re-cut extended, unrated, widescreen version.  Wow.  That's nice.  Well, only the best for our listeners.  Frank Miller's Sin City Touch.  You're welcome.  That's not a real thing, is it?  It certainly is.  Oh, it certainly is.  Please hang on the line so we can send that to you. 
[00:13:00]  Okay.  I'll hang on the line.  Ready?  You're getting one copy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She hung up.  She didn't like Jimmy's Choice.  How come when other shows and stations give away prizes, people go, oh, that's great.  Thank you.  What's your favorite radio station?  And they always say the station.  We give it away, and they hang up on us.  Jiminy Cricket.  Well, we'll see if we can give one of these away today, because now we've got a fine Opie 
[00:13:30]  and Anthony prize closet.  That's right.  We also have Bob Saget tickets to give away this week.  Our pal Bob Saget is playing the North Fork Theater Saturday.  That's the old Westbury Music thing, right?  Yeah, it used to be Westbury Music Fair.  Yeah, well, now it's called after a bank.  Ew.  Well, this is happening all over the freaking country.  Used to have some cool names for stadiums and rock venues, and now it's named after a bank. 
[00:14:00]  Banks.  North Fork Theater Saturday, April 20th.  Bob Saget's going to be there.  Doors at 6.30.  Show starts at 8.  We'll give away some tickets a little later on today.  We've got to wake up all the new bosses out there.  We can't catch a break in this business, I've got to tell you.  Why?  Well, the guy that brought us back to regular radio, Joel Hollander, is stepping down.  He's either getting fired, he's leaving on his own.  It's a little shady.  News has it that he's just stepping down. 
[00:14:30]  All the nice memos are going back and forth, we wish him nothing but the best, blah, blah, blah, all that corporate stuff.  But something's going on.  Yeah.  There's something going on.  And he's stepping down.  Well, rumor had it in the papers and New York Radio Message Board, the mecca of all radio message boards.  Yeah.  Rumor had it that maybe the relationship was a little strained between Les Moonves and Joel Hollander. 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  I don't get into their business.  I just come in here and do a radio show on a daily basis and hope to do the best of our ability to satisfy our bosses and our listeners.  That's what we do.  But Joel, for some reason, stepping down, stepping out of the organization here.  And that means a replacement.  Yeah.  So now for a couple of weeks, we've been here and there's been speculation going back and forth.  Who is it going to be?  Is it going to be somebody stepping in that can't stand the Opie and Anthony show, can't stand us personally? 
[00:15:30]  Well, that's what happened last time.  That is exactly what happened last time.  You might remember a guy named John Sykes who wanted to shut down, whip him out Wednesday.  That was the first meeting he had with us.  The first meeting we ever had with him.  And who had left at that point?  Who was out the door?  Dan Mason.  Was it Dan or was it Fareed?  I think it was Fareed. 
[00:16:00]  Who could keep track?  It was one of the bosses that kind of liked us.  All right.  And then they brought in this guy, John Sykes, because Viacom ran the radio division back then.  And he was a guy from VH1.  And they were trying this thing where they wanted to incorporate, like, their MTV VH1 thing into their radio stations in some way.  So they figured if they got a VH1 guy into the radio division, they'd be able to do that.  It's called synergy. 
[00:16:30]  Do you have synergy at your workplace?  Energy.  Stupid synergy.  I hate synergy.  That stinks.  Can't even say the word.  Sounds like a drink that you've got to drink when you're old.  Drink synergy.  When I'm 65, I started drinking synergy.  And I feel...  It sounds like an energy drink.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Feeling sluggish. 
[00:17:00]  Have some synergy.  I'll have a synergy in vodka.  Poor man's speedball.  Rock, rock, rock, rock.  So, yeah, they wanted some synergy.  And they also wanted to make it kind of family friendly.  Yeah.  They wanted to take the Opie and Anthony show and make it family friendly.  Family friendly.  That's what I got out of this guy.  Thank God we blew up our careers or we would have had to work with this guy.  So, we sat down with him and the first thing he says is, what, um, what guys are thinking 
[00:17:30]  about this Whip Him Out Wednesday?  Well, the greatest radio promotion ever, sir.  Like, man, it's given us a lot of mileage.  Kind of made our bones with it up in Boston.  Got a lot of attention.  Uh, here, all the stickers are based on, well, wow.  Uh, yeah.  It's kind of a big part of our show.  Can't drive around the tri-state area without seeing the wow stickers.  It gets the name out for the show.  It's just been unbelievable.  An unbelievable success for us.  Yeah.  And, uh, what do we get from him?  Um, I don't know. 
[00:18:00]  I don't think it's a good idea.  You know, uh, uh, kids.  You know, I have kids.  Oh, we did hear that.  And, um, if you're driving around and, and they see that sticker and ask what it is,  now you gotta explain what that's about.  And, and it's just not, you know, women flashing on open highways with, he had this big, and  me and Opie just kind of looked at each other like, oh, no, we are so screwed.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Uh, we knew that was the beginning of the end.  Yeah.  It truly was.  Yeah.  Did he mention that to me, Vinny?  We cocked it a big plot to get ourselves fired.  And made sure we got paid.  And get paid by doing that ruse, that thing that we said was a promotion, uh, sex for Sam.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was all planned in a back room to get ourselves fired because of this guy.  We couldn't work for this guy.  Right.  So we got ourselves fired and paid, uh, until he proved himself a failure and was summarily  thrown out. 
[00:19:00]  And, uh, there were rumors that he was coming, uh, to replace Joel Hollander, by the way.  Yeah.  Which had us shaking in our boots.  Oh, my God.  Shaking in our boots.  I see.  One of my favorite meetings with, uh, John Sykes, which was the second and only other  meeting we had with him.  Was when, uh, the whole thing with sex for Sam was going down and we didn't know what  was going to happen.  Um, this pretty much shows what kind of a pussy he was.  Oh, it was awful.  Yeah.  He, uh, he came in, uh, the room in Ken Stevens office where we were sitting to discuss all 
[00:19:30]  hell's breaking loose.  The press is obviously on it.  Yeah.  The paparazzi are following us at this point around the clock coverage on CNN, everyone  discussing our careers and we're, we're, we're scared.  We're like, God, are we going to, are we going to like, uh, survive this?  Dodge this bullet.  You know?  And we thought, uh, we should have survived this thing.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, John Sykes sat us down.  Oh, go ahead, Ann.  I'm sorry.  If you're a story.  We're sitting in Ken Stevens office, uh, our, our boss at the time.  And he sits us down and starts, starts discussing the situation. 
[00:20:00]  And we're like on the edge of our seat, listening to everything he's saying, because this is our  careers.  Our jobs are on the line.  So he gets a cell phone call.  He takes his cell phone.  He goes, yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  His eyes start looking at us as he's taking the cell phone call.  He goes from Anthony to myself, Anthony to myself.  Uh-huh.  He even said something like, yeah, well, right now.  And he goes, uh-huh.  Okay.  All right.  Click.  Shuts his phone.  Doesn't say another word.  He gets up and walks out of the office. 
[00:20:30]  Never to be seen again.  Yeah.  He just got up and left.  And we knew right then it was over.  That's what you want from management, by the way.  Because he was, his call that he got right there was, what are you doing?  Um, are you, are you with O&A right now?  Yeah.  Right now.  Yeah.  Um, okay.  Look, they're being fired.  Uh, don't say another word to them.  There's got to be this big investigation.  We're going to talk to them. 
[00:21:00]  The lawyers are going to talk to them.  But you don't, don't even say another word to them.  Okay.  Click.  Up.  Bye.  Goodbye.  He was gone.  Gone.  Never to be heard from again.  And that should have never happened because you guys would have survived that without a  problem.  Yeah.  And it was scathing after a little noise.  It would be fun.  Yeah, yeah.  And there's people that still know him that work for the company.  And he may even be listening right now.  That's why we do not respect this guy whatsoever.  No.  When you're in management, you get into some tough situations.  Got to get your hands a little dirty.  And, you know, he handled it horribly. 
[00:21:30]  He didn't have the balls to, like, say another word to our face.  And then we couldn't get anyone on the phone.  And then, you know, the rest of the story by now, I'm sure.  So, and then they were trying to get lawsuits going against us.  And, you know, we were clean.  We kept our nose clean.  I kept our nose clean.  They confiscated computers.  They were trying to get some kind of lawsuit against us back in the day.  I ran out of the office with my computer under my arm.  Remember that?  And then they were asking me where it was.  And I just was like, I don't know. 
[00:22:00]  I don't know.  Where's the computer?  That's company property.  I said, no.  I took your computer because I couldn't game on it and gave it to someone else and brought  my personal computer in to my office.  So that was my personal property.  And I took it home.  Well, we're going to need to look at the hard drive.  Oh, that's been formatted.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  They really said that?  We want the hard drive?  Yeah, they wanted to take all the info that was on my computer off of it.  I'm like, oh, no. 
[00:22:30]  That's home.  Oh, that's just all been formatted.  Yeah.  There's nothing on that.  Look at static.  Well, listen.  We've got to take a break.  Well, we'll say hi to our new boss next.  Yes.  It's a guy.  Some of the people that have been with the Opie and Anthony program for a while, this  is a familiar name and person and personality.  Anthony might have a character that he could finally bring back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Maybe.  But you'd have to have been with the program for quite a while. 
[00:23:00]  It's good for the new people as well.  Yeah.  We'll get into that next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  ONA, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Lindsey from Boston is back on the line.  Oh.  Listening, of course, on BCN. 
[00:23:30]  Lindsey, what's up?  Hey, are you still up on that office in City?  I kind of like that movie.  Ah.  You are going to receive an autographed copy of Frank Miller's Sin City.  This is the recut, extended, unrated, widescreen version that we've discussed many times in this program.  And it's yours.  Well, we offered it to you and you hung up on us.  I know.  I was just being silly.  Then I kind of thought about it.  I was like, I like Sin City.  Why don't I just own it?  Well, you're going to get it autographed by me and E-Rock. 
[00:24:00]  And we're not in it, but that's what you're getting.  Do you really want the movie?  I don't have that.  I could care less.  You really want the movie?  No, yeah.  I really do.  Oh, you could care less about the autographs?  Then go buy it.  Ah.  Atta boy.  She declined it.  She didn't want our signatures on it.  Anyway, so we're in the middle of waking up the new bosses out there.  So Ant gave the back story.  Joel Hollander's stepping down.  He's the guy that brought us back to regular radio.  Yep.  He's a huge supporter of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And the bastard is leaving us.  This happens.  We're sorry to see him go.  This happens all the time with us, by the way.  You get a guy in the company that supports you, and then next thing you know, they're  packing their boxes.  They're gone.  And they're little Dilbert cartoons.  Putting their nameplate in there and their plant.  Yeah.  They're hitting the highway, and they're bringing back our old boss.  Now, people might remember this guy.  He's going back a ways, but we used to refer to him as Southern Guy. 
[00:25:00]  Southern Guy.  Damn, boys.  What you doing?  Look, I like the show.  I like what you boys are doing.  I think it's fantastic.  I want you to push the edge, push the envelope, do whatever you got to do to get the numbers,  and, you know, I like the kind of show you do is, it's good, but goddamn, you lose this  license or put our license in jeopardy, I'm going to send you out the goddamn door.  But I love you, boys.  I think you're great.  You're fantastic.  He's pretty much schizo when it comes to us.  Oh, we had some great meetings with him. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, wait.  One.  We had one meeting with Dan Mason back in the day.  This concerns Boston, so we do the mayor's prank up there, and we get fired.  Yeah.  By the way, the anniversary of the mayor's prank, April 1st, nine years ago, nine years  ago, this April 1st, I do believe, we blew up our careers in Boston.  And that ass is still holding a grudge.  Yeah, he sure is.  So we get fired from Boston, and hey, we need work. 
[00:26:00]  And Infinity Broadcasting came a-call-in, but they wanted us to meet the head of the radio  division, Dan Mason, who's coming back to the company, to make sure we didn't have devil  horns.  Yeah.  So we get the phone call that we need to be on a flight immediately from Boston to Reagan  International Airport down there in D.C.  Immediately.  Immediately.  So Ant and I, very excited.  You know, we were only a one-market wonder at that point, a one-market sensation in this 
[00:26:30]  business.  We didn't get to travel much, so Ant and I, very excited that we get to go on a little  road trip.  Yeah.  And we're calling each other like, what are you packing, man, for the big meeting?  Yeah, you're wearing a suit.  You're going to wear a suit.  What are you doing?  Are we going to wear the suit on a plane, or are you packing it so we can change?  Because, you know, here's what we envisioned.  Here's what was going to happen.  We go to meet with Dan down there in D.C. 
[00:27:00]  We go out to dinner.  A nice dinner.  Yeah.  We're thinking nice dinner.  They want a wine and dine us.  Nice dinner.  Because at this point, they're interested in bringing us to New York.  Yeah.  And maybe stay overnight.  We don't know how long we're going to be there.  Stay overnight.  Possibly a knock at our door in the middle of the night.  Hookers for everybody.  Yeah, whatever.  Maybe a little that, you know.  A little blow.  Why not some dope? 
[00:27:30]  You know, whatever it takes to coax us.  In a whore bait.  Yeah.  As it's called in some circles.  Sure.  We're thinking everything.  And so, yeah, we're wondering what we should wear, this, that, the other thing.  And we fly out.  Fly out and get there.  And it's one of those, you know, you're up in the air, you're back down, you land.  Yeah, it's a quick flight.  Quick flight.  And we get to the airport, and there's a guy with a little sign that says Opie and Anthony. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, my God.  They're treating us nice.  Hey, living large, aren't we, guys?  I think that was the first time we've ever seen one of those little signs for us.  Yep.  Oh, you see it for everybody else.  The big hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, executives coming in off their flight.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, where's my car?  Mr. Peterson, this way, sir.  This way.  I'll get your bags.  And it was pretty funny because it was names like Peterson and, I don't know, whatever.  And then Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And the poor driver's like, oh, great.  I get these clowns.  We had long hair and we just looked like dopes. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  While everyone else is in their business suits waiting for their cars.  And we get into a car, and now we're going to go see Dan Mason.  And we figure it can't be far because we're right there in D.C.  Nothing's that far in D.C.  But apparently Dan's office was a little bit in the suburbs of D.C., like about an hour out.  At least an hour out in the middle of the suburbs, in the middle of like horse country, if you remember. 
[00:29:00]  It was the country.  We drove for an hour.  He was in some weird office park.  Yeah.  Far away from where you should be if you're making major decisions for a radio station, for a radio division.  A radio division.  So we drive out.  We get to the place.  And we go up to the office, and it's his secretary is there.  And the office is really small and wood paneled and looked very 1970s-ish.  And nothing's going on in the office. 
[00:29:30]  No.  Whatsoever.  A phone did not ring the entire time we were there.  And he's running the radio division.  So we...  We waited a long time.  We waited.  And you know when you're waiting in the office, and you're waiting a long time, but you see  people coming and going, so you're like, oh, this is really busy.  They'll get to me when they can.  It's called a hustle and bustle.  Yeah, but there's a lot going on.  A lot of decisions being made, honestly.  We're sitting there looking at each other, reading magazines that are like four years old,  like a Sports Illustrated from four years prior.  Yeah, it was like we were in a time machine. 
[00:30:00]  And they finally call us in to see Dan Mason.  Yeah, that was the big moment.  We walk in, big smiles, shake his hands, sit down in front of his desk.  And we look around the office.  Yeah.  There's a phone there.  It's not ringing.  It wasn't ringing.  You would think the guy that runs the radio division, he would have two phones.  My God.  And an assistant writing on a notepad.  Yeah.  So he's making decisions as he's talking to two different people on two different phones.  Hold on, boys. 
[00:30:30]  I got to take this call.  But, yeah, nothing was ringing.  So we're just sitting there.  And he says, so that thing you did up in Boston.  Like, yeah, the mayor thing.  You boys are not going to do anything like that again, would you?  And we looked and we were like, no.  Nah.  Nah, it was kind of, you know, silly and got us fired.  And, you know, we always like to, like, strive higher. 
[00:31:00]  So the next thing we're going to do is going to be a dozy.  Oh, Lulu.  No, we assured him that we weren't going to be doing anything like that.  Is it safe to say we had FaceTime with him for maybe 10 minutes?  Dude, if that.  If that.  He asked us that question.  And we had all these delusions that we were going to have dinner and all this other thing.  We were practicing speeches on the plane. 
[00:31:30]  And in the car.  And he kind of asked us that question.  And then he goes, all right.  I'm satisfied.  I'm satisfied.  I'm going to give my okay to hire you boys in New York.  Have the secretary phone your car and take you back to the airport.  Take care.  And we're walking out of the office that we were just in for, I swear, it had to be four minutes.  Yeah.  And we walked back in.  We're like shell-shocked asking the secretary, could you get us a car to take us back?  And we're sitting, waiting for our car, which then showed up, you know, an hour later. 
[00:32:00]  I don't know how long we sit in that office.  We felt like prostitutes.  Like we were brought in to, you know, give an old office, you know what?  Yeah.  And then you're sent on your way.  And then on our way.  With a cab fare.  Before we knew it, we were back at, like, Kennedy Airport.  No, no, Logan.  Or, uh, Logan.  Sorry.  Logan Airport.  Going, what just happened?  We were back in Boston in time for dinner. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, that was it.  Wearing our stupid suits that we thought we would need.  And our little overnight bags.  Yeah, our overnight bags, just in case, you know, we were going to be going out to the  Mason compound for some beverages.  We were just, what, what delusional idiots.  Self-important asses we were.  It's not even that.  It's not that we're self-important.  It's that we just, we just wish we would be treated better.  Yeah.  Like anyone else out there. 
[00:33:00]  And you realize, nah, you're just a.  I just didn't know, actually.  I had no idea.  I thought this was the way things were done.  And we would be, you know, go out for drinks.  It's, you know what it comes from?  It comes from watching Bewitched.  Like, that's all.  I watched all those shows growing up.  And I thought, you know, Larry Tate would take us out for drinks.  Make, give me, give me a double, Sam.  You know, or something like that.  But it knows.  All right.  You guys don't have horns and tails.  Be on your way.  You're not self-important asses. 
[00:33:30]  You know what you are?  You're dorks.  Yeah.  Dorks.  He didn't want to be seen with shock jocks.  Yeah.  It would be bad for his reputation.  Because companies like to hire shock jocks, especially back in the day.  But they didn't want to be seen with him.  They don't like being associated with them.  No.  Seen with them.  It's, you know.  It's like the engine room of a ship.  Right.  You know, you want to know it's there.  But it's dirty.  And you want to stay where the nice things are.  The luxury.  It's necessary. 
[00:34:00]  You know.  It drives the ship.  Yeah.  But it's dirty down there.  You don't want to see it.  So this is what I have to say today.  Joel Hollander.  Go screw.  Good morning.  And welcome back to the company.  Dan Mason.  Trying to kiss a new boss's ass.  I wouldn't say that to Joel.  Good riddance.  Well.  Sir.  You're going to be saying that later this afternoon.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Well, I guess we got to go to his office.  Better be nice.  On the 46th floor.  You're in Midtown.  You best be nice, my friend.  Good riddance.  Don't let the door hit you on the way out.  That's what I say to him today.  Do you think he's just inviting us up there to help him move?  I don't know.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Could you grab that into that couch?  I hope he's inviting us up there to fire us.  That's his last act of being the boss, fire us, his last duty.  Yeah, put us out of our misery. 
[00:35:00]  But Dan Mason's back with the company.  He's our new boss, and he's schizo.  He's like, you know, he wants us to push this show as far as we can.  But he's very safety conscious.  Yeah.  Which is good.  Yeah.  And that's where the whole thing came from.  All right, boys.  I'm in charge.  I'm back in charge again.  And, you know, I always like you boys.  I like the show.  I like what you got, boys, to do for the company.  Because it's all about the company and getting, you know, making the money, making the revenue.  You know, your show is good.  I want you to push. 
[00:35:30]  I want you to push it.  I want you to get your name out there.  And we're going to have a good relationship.  But I swear, by the grace of God, if anything happens, one FCC complaint or anything else happens, I would throw you out that goddamn door.  You understand me?  I like you, boys.  You're good boys.  Thank you, sir.  I met you.  Thank you.  I met you.  We had a long talk.  I believe it was 2.8 minutes.  It was about, yeah, five minutes.  That's a long goddamn talk for me.  And I believe in you. 
[00:36:00]  I believe in the program.  I'm a big fan of the show.  You guys play music?  I'm a big fan.  What do you do?  You're a talk show.  That's right.  Okay, I got the paper in front of me here.  I'm a big fan of the show.  I love you boys.  Mr. Mason, you keep saying you're a big fan of the show.  Just name one lousy thing we've done.  We've been back on regular radio almost a year.  You don't even have to go into our past.  What one thing have you heard in the last year?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:36:30]  Ring.  Ring.  All my phone drinks.  Hold on.  Hold on.  My phone's ringing.  Give me anything they've done.  Just put it on my computer screen.  Yeah, these guys don't know.  All right.  You did that.  You did that.  What the hell was that?  That thing with the girls in a barrel, it was called.  55-gallon drum challenge?  That's what I was saying.  55-gallon drum challenge.  That's the kind of stuff I need you boys doing.  We haven't done that in four years, sir. 
[00:37:00]  Did I get that?  What about you said one thing that qualifies?  You did the sex with Sam.  Well, everyone knows that.  That was international headlines, sir.  With Sam?  For Sam?  That was your cue to goof on how I didn't even know the name.  I know.  Well, not listening, sir.  See, that's the problem.  You boys don't listen.  You get me in trouble.  You get the station in trouble.  You get the division in trouble. 
[00:37:30]  Now, I want you boys to be good.  But push it.  Get ratings.  Get ratings.  Get revenue.  Get ratings.  But I will toss your asses out a window if you interfere with the business of work into this division.  Now, go ahead and do what you do.  All right.  Whatever the hell that is.  All right.  Thank you.  Ring, ring.  Oh, my phone's ringing again.  I'm a busy man.  All right.  Dan Mason, everyone.  The new boss who used to be the old boss.  And to Joel, hit the road, Jack. 
[00:38:00]  You know something, I'm not going to sit in his office and have to listen to how we were saying those things.  Joel who is what I say today.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for Joel.  I love when the ass kissing gets to come to an end.  We don't have to kiss his ass anymore.  Jesus.  So long, sir.  It's going to be a real comfy meeting.  So long.  Real comfy. 
[00:38:30]  Good luck with your next endeavor.  Better hope so.  All right.  Hey, life-changing moment happening.  This is an ongoing bit on the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Brian from PA.  What's up, Brian?  Not much.  I closed on a house this week.  And I have a fiance, and she's about to find out that she ain't moving in.  Why?  How old do you?  Well, how old do you?  Hold on.  Give us some back history.  How old?  23.  How old is she? 
[00:39:00]  21.  How long have you been dating?  About two years.  When did he get engaged?  About a year ago.  All right.  And you're moving into a new house, and you have decided that you've got to break off the  engagement.  Yeah.  All right.  Why?  It's a moment of clarity.  What's the moment of clarity?  Pain in the ass.  Sorry.  Pain in the butt.  Did things change when you got engaged?  A little bit, yeah.  Like what?  In what way?  Like, basically what everybody says.  You know, put a quarter in the jar every time you do something sexual, and that next 
[00:39:30]  year you won't have any money left.  Everyone says that, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do they say?  Can you say it again?  Because Jimmy's a little confused.  Yeah.  Put a quarter in the jar.  It's a saying that's been around since.  You don't have a sexual experience to put a quarter in a jar for the first year.  Right.  The rest of your life, you can take one out, and you'll never run out of money.  That's stupid.  It's a saying that goes back to the cavemen. 
[00:40:00]  Basically, I didn't get laid anymore.  What are coins back then?  Yeah.  There's rocks in a big thing.  Put a cave drawing into a jar.  All right, so you're telling her today that the engagement's off.  Yeah, that she ain't moving in.  And how are you going to do that?  Probably right before I leave for closing.  Do you want to do it live on our show and humiliate her in front of two countries?  Probably get punched in the teeth.  So what?  That's beautiful.  Yeah, we would like that. 
[00:40:30]  Look at the stuff I confess on this show.  Yeah.  Maybe you could put us on speakerphone.  I got it.  Well, closing's at noon, so I'll probably have to record it or something.  Oh, boy.  That never works.  They never do it.  Well, what are you going to do?  You're going to do it right before closing?  Yeah, I said it right as I'm getting in the car to go to closing.  And you're going to do it in the car with her?  No, right before she gets in.  So you're going to pick her up at her house, and you're going to allow her to go through  the whole process of getting excited and showering and putting on her favorite, we're closing 
[00:41:00]  on a house outfit.  Oof.  She's going to be all dolled up, a little perfume, and then you're going to hit her  with the cinder block?  Yeah, I'm going to stumble.  Why don't you do it while she still has morning breath?  No fun.  All right.  Well, you've got to let us know how it goes tomorrow, all right?  All right.  I'll give you a call back.  All right.  Good luck to you, sir.  Later.  All right.  We've got Dan in Kansas.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to thank Jimmy for all this stuff he talks about, you know, all the 
[00:41:30]  stuff he likes to do, recreational.  Yes, you're welcome.  Are you the same?  Well, I always wanted to try some of that stuff with the old lady, and after listening to you,  I finally decided to give it a shot, and he'll be like it.  Oh, good.  Wait, what thing has Jimmy turned you on to?  Now, be careful.  We're on the old regular radio, being monitored by our new boss, Dan Mason.  What was this latest endeavor that he's doing? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, the one he's got to get tested for?  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  So, Jimmy talks about that yesterday, and you decide you need this done immediately, and  you did it yesterday?  Yeah.  And?  What do you think?  I love it.  It's kind of like sitting on a wet sponge, though, isn't it?  Uh, well, I don't know.  I, uh...  Were you surprised how good it was?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was.  See, I had to do it to her first.  Oh, why wouldn't you want to, dude?  That's my favorite thing to do. 
[00:42:30]  Get all the joys and benefits of it without looking at their dumb face.  Now, Dan, you sound like a man's man.  Do what?  You sound like a man's man.  Well, I'm just a trucker man.  Oh, boy.  A trucker sitting down all day.  Oh, no.  Oh, that...  Man, she must really love you.  Wow.  I hope you saw her after a local run.  Yeah.  Wow, she must really love you.  How much do you weigh there, Dan?  Oh, about 240.  Oh, wow.  240.  Oh, my God.  He's trucking something from L.A. to New York. 
[00:43:00]  Gets home.  Honey, I got to tell you what Jim told me today, and she goes right for it.  Man, she's a keeper, I got to tell you.  Hopefully, you haul clothespins so she doesn't have to throw in her nose.  Did she enjoy this?  Yeah, she did.  Or did she enjoy that you were enjoying it?  Well, I don't know so much about that.  Yeah.  It's awful.  Did she shower up real good beforehand, sir?  Oh, yeah.  I think if you're going to have that done, I think you got to have, like, you got to be in shape, and you can't be a man's man. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  You can't be like a trucker with a beer belly.  I don't picture that type of person getting this thing done, Jimmy.  Yeah, I mean, you have to be, and I'll toot my own horn, I'm a good candidate.  Just picture Charlie Brown's head split down the middle.  Lucky girl.  All right, Dan, there you go.  Jimmy, turning you on to something new today. 
[00:44:00]  Appreciate it, guys.  Good luck, young Dan.  All right.  With that, we take a break.  We're going to get into some of the things America's talking about next.  Anna Nicole Smith.  The hell is America talking about?  Stupid Anna Nicole Smith.  Enough.  An accidental overdose?  What?  Yeah, that's an accident.  We got the list of things that they found in her body.  Any one of these things would be a joy ride.  Any one of those pills, if any just normal person took them, they'd be in space for a few hours. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we turn the news on?  We can still watch the coroner talking.  He's just a lumpy head.  Endless.  Yeah, we committed to something yesterday.  Boy, did we make a huge, huge error in judgment.  We'll get into that whole thing next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:45:00]  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  America just sucks.  John Edwards, his wife, the cancer is back.  It's going to kill her.  And what does America do?  They're beating up John Edwards a little bit.  What?  Because they're like, oh, you know, wow, using your wife's cancer to get some votes.  That's like 300 million to one.  All of America's beating him up? 
[00:45:30]  I bet he loses.  Maybe, all right, yeah, maybe not America's sucking.  But there are people out there that just suck.  America.  First of all, John Edwards will not be our next president.  So leave the guy alone and his dying wife.  Pretty brave.  I mean, she announced that the cancer's back.  And she decided, look, what am I supposed to do, stay at home and die?  Or, you know, help my husband out and maybe a miracle will happen and he'll get elected and I help a little bit.  Yeah.  You know, but then people are all over John Edwards like, oh, my God, using your wife's cancer to get votes, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, Katie Couric was really, like, grilling her.  Yeah.  And took a little criticism for that.  Why doesn't Katie Couric worry about her ratings and being a woman at a man's job?  Jimmy?  What?  We work for the same company.  Why should she worry about this stuff?  She's busy getting some real journalism done.  That's right.  So they're talking about that. 
[00:46:30]  But, you know, he's not going to be the next president.  Just leave the guy alone.  No, he's running his...  Obama!  Wow.  You're excited about that Obama.  I've been excited about him for a very long time.  Well...  He's a hell of a public speaker.  That's all I know about him.  Unless the Democrats come up with somebody else.  I think they're in big trouble with the Hillary Obama thing.  I like him a lot better than her.  She just stinks. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, she's a non-factor in this.  I mean, she really thinks, because she's so popular in New York and gets elected in New York,  that it's going to be a whole nationwide thing.  Sorry.  They should just announce that Bill Clinton's going to be the vice president on the tickets.  That would really make it fun.  We still can't figure out if that's legal.  I know.  No one knows.  But anyway, so people are talking about the Elizabeth Edwards thing a little bit, a little bit. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  And, of course, the big news, because this is the type of thing that drives America.  And Nicole Smith.  The autopsy results happened yesterday while we were still doing our radio show.  Stupid us.  We decided to turn up the TV and kind of watch it and give the results to everybody.  Yeah, kind of, you know, as they came in, we could comment on them in real time.  And that ghoul of a coroner gets up there, and I thought it was question and answer time. 
[00:48:00]  The press was there.  They were going to ask him questions about her, and he was going to answer them.  Well, he thanked the Academy before he even said anything.  He thanked everybody ever associated with his life, I think.  The guy got up there and spent 20 minutes just thanking everybody that worked on this with him.  Send a card.  That's not what the news wants to hear.  They don't care.  It's not what the people want to hear.  It's not like there were a little too many people involved with this autopsy, by the way. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, my God, we keep thanking people.  You know the word got out.  Hey, we got a hottie.  Yeah, get in here.  We got a hottie.  Do you want to see her naked?  Yeah, no, no, she's dead.  Yeah, but she's naked.  We'll give you some mundane job to make it official, but you need to be here and check  this out.  500 bucks, you get 10 minutes alone time.  You want alone time?  So yesterday, 45 minutes later, we still didn't have a cause of death and we had to give up 
[00:49:00]  on the creepy coroner with the huge lump on his head.  The old bump head was just babbling on.  Old Gumby head.  He was babbling all this scientific crap about drugs.  Yeah.  In her body.  And we learned that the bump on his head was caused by, what, an ant that dropped him  on his head when he was an infant?  Apparently, his aunt had dropped him, as Jimmy said, what, out of an airliner?  She dropped him on his head when he was an infant and it caused a blood clot which thickened 
[00:49:30]  the bone, his skull, thickened his skull bone for some crap and it put a big ridge on his  head.  Is this even like a single bump, like a cartoon bump?  And he's the poor guy that has to lose his hair.  Yeah.  If he didn't lose his hair, no one would know that he has the Gumby head thing.  If he had a big, full head of hair, he could just brush it and cover up that big ridge. 
[00:50:00]  He'd be fine.  With a nice, big head of hair.  But God is cruel, isn't he?  Oh, and you know he went bald early.  Yeah.  Because he had like nothing.  He had the little horseshoe.  He's got the old horseshoe.  So he like...  A big bump.  He had the big bump on his head and then he starts losing his hair and he's totally bald  and that bump is like...  It's like there's a certain dinosaur that has that ridge on their head.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what it is. 
[00:50:30]  What?  We all know exactly what you mean.  Dilapfosaurus or something.  I don't know what it's called.  If that's correct, I'm going to go over there and...  No, it's not.  I know it's not, but it sounds like that.  Yeah.  And it's got a ridge and that's what he looks like, only it's kind of off-center.  He looks like that thing that spit the acid into Newman's face in Jurassic Park.  All right.  Well, meds kill Dana.  We know that by now.  A Florida coroner rules out suicide, really.  And foul play and tragic final act of ex-playboy playmate. 
[00:51:00]  And then the paper, our paper, here's a rundown of what she had in her system when she died.  Of an accidental overdose.  Yeah.  This is what she was prescribed?  Yeah.  I guess there weren't any illegal drugs.  You know, when you get really famous, you get these doctors around you that'll give you anything.  Yeah.  I just had Dr. Nicopolis.  You know, everyone's got like that one that they can get whatever they want from.  Yeah.  Yeah, they keep it all legal on the up and up.  But what you're doing is you're just killing these celebrities slowly. 
[00:51:30]  This is what was found in her system.  We start with chloral hydrate.  That's a potent sedative.  I heard this drug is used in like date rape drugs.  Nice.  Date rape drugs.  Chloral hydrate.  I guess it's like, it's a sleeping pill.  Like when you take this, you're almost immediately asleep.  Like immediately.  Laying down in bed.  You have to take it laying down in bed for the most part.  Really?  Yeah, supposedly.  Yeah.  This is like the hardcore stuff that the celebrities get to fall asleep. 
[00:52:00]  This is a biggie.  This is a doozy.  Is that addictive though?  Third time I used doozy today.  Of course it is.  I'm going for 10.  Yeah.  I think Marilyn Monroe had a little list in her system as well.  Oh yeah?  And you know, she liked Marilyn Monroe.  So what the hell?  That's sweet.  Might as well die like her too, right?  Did she take any Joe DiMaggio?  Because apparently she...  A teaspoon of Joe DiMaggio.  Had a little of that.  Yeah, Anna, you didn't like Marilyn that much.  You could have had a little Joe.  A little Joe.  Take two black eyes and call me in the morning. 
[00:52:30]  Anyway, so we start with the chloral hydrate.  That was in her system.  Then you go on to the Klonopin.  Anti-seizure, anti-anxiety drug.  A lot of people are familiar with the old Klonopin.  Klonopin.  Then you throw a little Valium in there.  Valium.  Nice.  Or anti-anxiety.  I was given a Valium because of my tooth that day.  Remember I had the toothache and I had to go upstairs and get it taken care of? 
[00:53:00]  Took some Valium.  And I always say, when you get Valium, the first one you take, the feeling you get, you  count the rest of the Valium you have in the bottle.  I poured them all out in my hand and went, one, two, three.  How many do I have?  How long am I going to be able to use these?  Oh, these are fantastic.  I got the dumb laser eye surgery.  Yeah.  And they gave me the lowest dosage of Valium, but they gave me like, I think it was ten  pills.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  And you nailed it.  Also, I'm like, whoa, I got to save these.  The second you feel it, you count them.  Right.  And you go, how many days do I got?  Oh, this is good.  And you don't feel guilty or like you're doing anything wrong.  No, they're prescribed.  They're prescribed.  I'm in pain, I think.  Next thing you know, you want to go to sleep a little earlier or you're feeling a little  on edge.  Ow, I bit my tongue.  Gulp.  Gulp.  As you two are describing this, me and dumb Steve are just eye contacting each other going,  ooh.  Ooh, that sounds delicious. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, Valium is really something else.  Yeah.  And you do count them.  Yeah.  You want to know exactly how many days I'm going to be able to feel like this.  They supposedly have a horrible detox, too.  Like, they say alcohol is the worst.  Like, worse than Coke, worse than all of them.  Yeah.  And Valium is right there, too.  It's supposed to be a really bad detox.  Yeah.  I can only imagine.  All right.  Hold on.  We're getting some info on the old chloral hydrate.  Frank in New Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, Frank.  Frank. 
[00:54:30]  Hank.  Grandson Frank.  I hung up.  Boy, I think we have another person.  He said it's a Mickey.  That's what they use in Mickey.  A Mickey?  Nolan from San Antonio.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, that chloral hydrate, man.  That's a really, really old medication.  They won't even, like, prescribe that to normal people anymore.  Nah, I slipped there at all, Mickey Finn.  Nobody gets that anymore.  And I wanted to say thanks, Jimmy, for recommending that Pure Lube, man.  That stuff was great.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:55:00]  God bless.  I want to see you.  Hey, a solution of chloral hydrate in alcohol called Knockout Drops was used to prepare a Mickey Finn.  Oh, so that was that stuff where, like, the girl goes to the bathroom and you have a little eyedropper.  Yeah.  Slept on a Mickey Finn.  Yeah, this stuff is, uh, this is just dangerous, dangerous stuff.  The Bowery boys are using it.  What the hell is this old crap?  Where does she get it?  I'm also hearing, uh, chloral hydrate.  Is this from Steve?  Thank you, Steve.  I know everything about chloral hydrate. 
[00:55:30]  It's also used in horse tranquilizers.  Holy crap.  Sometimes I put it in honey when I can't sleep.  Teaspoon of honey, some chloral hydrate.  Steve and S from Bayshore are always good for a bunch.  Uh, so, oh, basically, Anna Nicole died from eating Elvis's breakfast.  Well, yeah.  Uh, John in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, Owen, eh?  Hey.  Hey, uh, yeah, I just wanted to say that corner's head looks like the monster from the, uh, from 
[00:56:00]  the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Yeah, what was that monster's name?  That was chasing him around.  What the hell was the monster?  Monsters are such interesting people.  He's filing his nails.  Yeah.  Punch it out, boys.  That's a good observation.  You know what else was in her sister they forgot to mention?  Uh, oats.  Do you see the teeth on this bitch in this photo?  Well, oh my, enough of her gums.  Yeah.  Well, she looks like.  That's a stupid smile she would put on.  Well, she'd smile like that because she's just grinding her teeth.  Getting all the drugs that might be in between her teeth. 
[00:56:30]  Big stupid Mr. Edmouth.  All right, so let's move on.  This is what was found in her, uh, in her body when she died.  The chloral hydrate, uh, that's used in Mickey's, the Klonopin, the Valium.  And then we move on to Ativan, another anti-anxiety.  She had three anti-anxiety drugs in her.  Jesus.  That's insane.  That would make you nervous.  Any one of these pills would do the job.  So then you got, uh, and then you move on to the Benadryl.  What?  She's stuffy?  Yeah.  She was a little stuffy. 
[00:57:00]  A little stuffy.  And the Benadryl will knock you out too.  Yeah.  So the Benadryl will knock you out.  The chloral hydrate certainly will knock you out.  The Valium will, will put you down a little bit.  And then you move on to Soma, I believe, which is a muscle relaxer.  Oh, that's smart.  There you go.  That's smart.  You know, a, uh, one of the muscles is called your diaphragm.  Yeah.  It, it makes you breathe.  That's a muscle.  And well, the other end, you know.  That's how people die from, uh, muscle relaxers a lot of times. 
[00:57:30]  Really?  Odin on that.  Yeah.  The, the diaphragm stops working.  It's a muscle.  It just stops working.  So you stop breathing.  You mean you stop, can you still make yourself breathe or you?  No.  Once that diaphragm, uh, stops working, you're dead.  You're dead.  Uh, Gossamer, by the way.  Oh, Gossamer was the, uh, monster.  Yes.  So, uh, so she had the muscle relaxer, but all this stuff is putting her to sleep and,  and, and taking her down real low.  And that's real smart to loosen up all the muscles, if you know what I mean.  Every single muscle. 
[00:58:00]  Every single muscle.  Yeech.  Let's put it this way.  Jimmy wouldn't be, uh, oh, you're thinking every muscle is loosened up.  Every muscle, yes.  Even though, the, the, those important ones.  Making cleanup a real bitch.  Oof.  Uh, then you got, uh, I don't even know this one.  Never heard of this one before.  Roba, Rob, Rob, Roboxin.  Oh.  Tussin.  R-O-B-A-X-I-N, anyone?  No.  Roboxin we'll go with?  Another muscle relaxer. 
[00:58:30]  Sedative.  And this is an accidental overdose?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  How is that an accident?  Did she fall mouth first on her bottles of pills?  Dude, when I take, sometimes I'll take a couple Tylenol PMs, I get all paranoid.  Like, oh God.  You know?  Yeah.  How do you pop all these pills and just go to sleep assuming your body's going to be just  fine?  Then you got the, uh, Topamax.  I've never heard of this one either. 
[00:59:00]  For migraine headaches.  Topamax?  Topamax.  For migraine headaches.  And then you got the Ciprofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, I don't know.  It's an antibiotic.  Oh, for her, uh, her butt infection.  Yeah, a little infection happening.  Then you got the atropine or atropine used by medics trying to revive her.  Oh, okay.  So that was, that was the only drug that someone else put her in. 
[00:59:30]  Atropine, right?  Oh, and then it ends, and this is what makes it hilarious, and also in her system, Tylenol.  Val.  You need the Tylenol.  Oh, I thought you said Vicodin.  You said Valium?  Yeah, Valium.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I was talking about it.  We're getting some phone calls.  Yeah, I took the Vicodin, not the Valium.  It says right here, um, that she was, her last days were miserable and that she was, had  this feverish sweat and it produced a pungent odor.  So she stunk and, uh, they were going to take her to the hospital and they gave her an ice 
[01:00:00]  bath and knocked her down to like 97 degrees.  Meanwhile, diet, slim fast, and soda cans, not to mention half-eaten packs of nicotine  gum piled up around her.  What enchanting breath she must have had.  A pussy-ass cheek and dumpster breath.  Nice gums.  Yeah.  Beated.  And we're supposed to look at her like some kind of sex symbol.  Oh, just go to the hospital, stupid.  She was pretty much a walking, rotting corpse.  She was just a mess.  With bad breath.  And there's a rumor that there was an old slim fast on the, uh, nightstand too. 
[01:00:30]  Oh no, that's what it said right here.  Oh, did you say that?  Jimmy, I'm sorry.  It said that they found slim fast and they found like a nicotine gum.  Yeah.  It's just, can you do anything on your own?  Do you need help for everything?  Now that was all the stuff that was in her system.  And then here's all the other drugs she was prescribed or known to use in the days and  months before she died.  Uh, uh, methadone.  Uh, she was using a human growth hormone for longevity and anti-aging.  For longevity.  Good one.  She would do the vitamin B12 injections. 
[01:01:00]  Uh, she had some drug called immunoglobulins, globulins.  I don't know.  For longevity.  Demerol, potent pain relief, Dalmaine, another sleeping aid, and then like Jimmy said, nicotine  gum.  And the hot beef injections.  So.  Never afraid to crash myself.  So she was trying to get off cigarettes.  Yeah. 
[01:01:30]  Is that where all this is in her system, but she was concerned about her smoking.  Well, smoking is dangerous.  And they're saying it's accidental.  That's beyond a joke.  Accidental.  She obviously, uh, slowly killed herself.  Can I point something out too?  Yeah.  Around 1 p.m.  The next day, I believe this is where she died, the wife of her boat captain found her  in bed and summoned her a caretaker because she didn't like the way Ann Nicole looked.  She saw her face was slumped downward and her mouth was open and she wasn't breathing.  After frantic attempts to revive Smith, her caretakers finally called paramedics at around 
[01:02:00]  140.  Wow.  How long is that?  40 minutes.  Woo!  They said if she went to the hospital, she would have been all right.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Uh, let's go to, she refused to go to the hospital, by the way.  Yeah, she did turn it down.  Yeah.  Offered her.  Let's go to Heather in Buffalo.  Heather?  Hello.  Hey.  I was calling, I work at a trauma hospital in Buffalo.  We use chloral hydrate on the patients that we have that are head traumas.  When they're coming out of their comas, from their head traumas, and that calms them down 
[01:02:30]  because of their bad behavior.  Yeah.  So it's still used today.  It knocks you out, right?  Almost immediately?  It knocks them out, yes.  Almost immediately?  Almost immediately.  Wait a minute.  That was a good call?  Was it, Jimmy?  Miss, that was very helpful.  You still there?  Oh, no.  I was.  I am.  Well, the prize closet doors are being flung open.  We asked the company for an Opie and Anthony prize closet, and boy, do we have a prize closet. 
[01:03:00]  We certainly do.  Miss, do you like Eddie Murphy?  Do I like Eddie Murphy?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Well, that's good.  Because you're getting a copy of Saturday Night Live, the Saturday Night Live, the best of  Alec Baldwin.  That's what you're receiving.  Dude.  All of Alec Baldwin's funny moments.  You know what?  You're making a joke there, but between the Saturday Night Live, the best of Eddie Murphy  or the best of Alec Baldwin, I personally would choose Alec Baldwin.  Well, in that case, miss, Opie has just C-blocked your gift. 
[01:03:30]  You are not getting that.  You are getting a copy of Suicide Kings starring our pal Jay Moore.  It's going to be signed by Steve.  Oh, nice.  How about we give her the choice at this point?  Suicide Kings or the best of Alec Baldwin?  I'd go with Alec Baldwin.  Okay, good.  All right.  So don't even give your address because you're not getting that.  No, no.  I know.  They're punching out, guys.  No, no, don't punch out.  We really want to give some of these prizes away.  Beat it. 
[01:04:00]  Hold on a line, Heather.  Good for nothing.  Beat it.  Hold on.  Druggy.  She's listening on the edge there in Buffalo.  Druggy.  All right.  Here, give her whatever she wants of those two choices.  We have to autograph it, Steve.  Okay.  Dan, you have a little thing.  I have it all the time.  It's awful.  It's because I had like a cold and a cough for the past week.  Oh, really?  And it's just going away, but I'm still all...  No one helps with that.  I got something for you right here.  Oh, unzip.  What am I, someone's uncle?  What kind of joke is that? 
[01:04:30]  Anything else?  Pull a quarter out from my ear.  I just am awful.  I got something right here for you.  I should be on the Wise Guys show.  I'm out.  I got to do shit.  Don't eat balls right here.  Do that right.  I got something for Brazil.  Speaking of which, the Sopranos are doing their big, huge party.  Oh, yeah.  Final season of the Sopranos.  So, of course, we're going to have a lot of the guys that are on the Sopranos stop by today.  It's going to be a parade of Sopranos stars. 
[01:05:00]  I think it was last night or night.  So, they're all in town.  We're a big radio show, so I'm sure Roland just booked nothing but Sopranos people for the rest of the day.  Right?  And we were talking about the Sopranos from episode one.  I mean, so they should be coming in here.  Make sure all our guests from the Sopranos have everything they need.  Yep.  Nice and comfortable.  This is what, this shows how pathetic we really are as far as getting guests on our show. 
[01:05:30]  Rocky, Sylvester Stallone puts out that last movie, right?  Rocky 8.  Balboa.  Rocky Balboa.  And Sylvester Stallone is doing the rounds.  He's on every talk show in America.  We are offered Frank Stallone.  Frank Stallone.  Why did we pass that up?  And people wonder why I have a problem with the booking of guests on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:06:00]  Sylvester Stallone doing press all over the place.  We get offered Frank Stallone because I think he did the song for the movie.  Uh, didn't you see Frank Stallone in Rocky 3, my friend?  When Rocky was training, he was singing at the hotel lobby where they set up their gym.  Way to throw him a bone, Sly.  Yeah.  Was he?  Oh, it was awful.  All right, let's...  I understand Rambo, he's driving a milk truck.  Let's go to Ryan.  She's a girl.  She's from the Bronx.  Hi, I'm a nurse, and I just want to say they gave her, um, chlorpene because she, um, couldn't take any other medication. 
[01:06:30]  That's what she needed.  What do you mean she couldn't take any other medication?  I just listed all the stuff they found in her system.  Ten other medications.  In order to put her to sleep because she is so addicted to other medication.  You mean she, because of the progression, she had to take something really strong because this stuff wouldn't work anymore.  Yes.  Yeah, you're probably right.  She has to take that, everything that, because it's so hardcore to make, to put her to sleep. 
[01:07:00]  The people around her killed her.  Yeah.  They were too scared that, uh, if they, if they stepped up and said, look, you got a problem, that she would cut them off.  A gravy train would end.  A lot of favor.  Yeah, I mean, it was so obvious that this, uh, this woman, this, this, this, you know what, uh, needed a lot of help.  And those trim spa people have to be, um, they were giving her HDH to make her lose weight.  Whatever.  Why don't you just do some crunches and stop already? 
[01:07:30]  Exactly.  Well, that's another thing.  That's the diarrhea.  Get a hold of yourself.  They found no, like, trim spa in her.  They were giving her HDH to make her lose weight.  Yeah, of course.  I mean, they had a lot of riding on her losing weight.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Ryan.  I think they didn't find a lot of celery in her or a lot of...  Well.  A lot of apples.  A lot of carrot juice.  I'm willing to go on the record to say she's probably at her lightest ever right now.  At her smartest. 
[01:08:00]  Let's go to Mark in Canada.  Mark.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I'm just thinking this all sounds like a really bad episode of House.  Yeah.  Does it?  Your call sounds like a...  Never mind.  Uh-huh.  Never mind.  Very good.  You know, we could have easily done another 20 minutes on this, but you wrecked it for  everybody, so we should step aside.  And I want to, until we get back, a little trouble for the Subway Superman.  Oh. 
[01:08:30]  Is that not an entertainment...  Let's all tease something.  You want to talk about that?  Yes.  I want to talk about, uh, he's put out for stud.  This loser.  That's the best story of the week.  Yeah, I like that one.  Could be the best story of the month.  Absolutely.  Month is almost over.  I love this guy.  And Ant, you want to tease something?  Oh, uh, no.  I ain't got nothing to tease.  You're sweet.  Boy, this guy's just...  Got my review of the final episode of Rome. 
[01:09:00]  I bought Deadwood.  I haven't watched it yet, but maybe Rome will move on.  I'm a little bummed that Rome is...  Can I go to the end of the feedback?  Someone needs attention.  Sure.  This was sent by YouFaggots, location Florida, message.  You guys have one of the biggest talk shows in America, and you are two of the biggest  crybabies, you effing faggots.  First of all, it's three.  We're not crybabies.  Why are we crybabies?  Crybabies.  Because we actually want real guests on our show.  Oh, is that what you were saying we were crying about? 
[01:09:30]  It's funny.  I guess.  You know, talking about something and just mentioning it and actually crying, here's  what it would sound like.  Go ahead.  Why don't we get guests?  I want a better guest.  We kind of made it funny for some people out there.  I mean, if you don't understand why it's funny that Sylvester Stallone wasn't offered  for our show, but Frank Stallone was.  Frank Stallone.  Self-deprecating humor is just terrific at times.  If you don't get it.  You should have gotten Frank Stallone. 
[01:10:00]  Really?  No.  Come on.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  What's up?  Good morning.  How's things?  Yeah?  Well, all right.  Dandy.  We just listed all the drugs in Anna Nicole Smith's system. 
[01:10:30]  A lot of sleeping things in there.  Yeah.  And we missed the obvious joke, so we have to thank, it looks like Am, A-M-M-Pen from  Westchester on the instant feedback.  The link is on opiananthony.com.  He writes, Benadryl, Valium, holy S.  Dig her up.  She might just still be sleeping.  Don't be surprised.  She wakes up.  Where am I?  Where am I?  Where am I? 
[01:11:00]  Now we got a doctor.  A lot of doctors pissed off that the nurses are calling as the experts today.  Leave the heavy lifting to the doctors.  What's up, Corey?  How's it going?  If we want to talk about bedpans, then we would invite you to call the program.  Jeez.  Let's get a doctor on the phone.  Dr. Corey from Miami.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  Three things.  One, what that last nurse from the Bronx said, I don't know where she trained, but  Klonopin and Valium are essentially the same drug.  They're just, they both, they're in the same class. 
[01:11:30]  They just act like a really long time.  And Ativan, again, the same drug, but it acts a little bit less of a time.  And what Jimmy said before, like, that whole class of drugs, like the benzodiazepines,  they're actually the absolute worst withdrawal of any drug.  It's worse than, like, parents are known to, like, throw their kids off balconies because  they think they're demons or something.  Oh, so then there's a positive to it.  Yeah, exactly.  Great.  Thanks for saying that, by the way.  It's a wonder I'm alive today.  Great.  One last thing, though.  A little inside. 
[01:12:00]  I think what Anthony said about with muscle relaxes actually isn't true.  Oh, thank you.  They don't paralyze your diaphragm.  They actually, like, the reason why people die ultimately from taking muscle relaxes is  because their death calms down their nervous system so much that they go to sleep and their  brain forgets to, forgets to make them breathe.  Really?  Yeah.  So, like, you can actually, if you're awake enough, you can breathe if you want to.  So, it's like there's voluntary and involuntary muscles.  Like, your diaphragm is involuntary, but you have, like, voluntary muscles in your chest,  which are, like, when people are, like, really, really bad COPDers and, like, they're, like, 
[01:12:30]  really struggling to breathe, you'll see them, like, use those muscles, like, inside the  ribcage to breathe.  And at that point...  How is your diaphragm an involuntary muscle if you can stop it?  You can't...  I mean, you can't really make yourself stop it.  Like, there's...  You actually...  Like, kids, like, they get pissed off.  You can say, I'm going to hold my breath and, you know, whatever.  Like, they can't actually...  You can't make yourself...  You can't, like, choke yourself from holding your breath because your diaphragm will kick  in and your brain will say, breathe.  Yeah, but it's not involuntary muscle like the heart where you, you know, you can't  just stop that by thinking. 
[01:13:00]  Um, you can...  You can hold yourself, like, it's...  It's a smooth muscle.  You know, there's, like, smooth muscle and there's the stride muscle.  Stride muscle's, you know, your bicep and your...  I'm not going to argue with a doctor.  Trust me on this.  The smooth muscle, like, I mean, you can make your...  I mean, you can choose to, like, say, I'm going to hold my breath a little bit,  but, like, ultimately, like, your brain will say, I'm going to breathe.  Oh, my God, Corey.  What did you eat last night?  Doctor.  Hey.  What was that?  Fart equals funny always.  The doctor has a sound effect machine? 
[01:13:30]  That was something with a phone line.  What?  Yeah, we hear it.  Oh, God, Corey.  Sorry.  What, Taco Bell last night?  Yeah.  Listen.  It won't stop.  I don't know.  I must have been that Ethiopian for that.  Getting all this serious info from a doc as he's letting loose a little.  Maybe he had a few of these drugs in his system.  Something else seems a little loose, huh, doc? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, it happens.  All right.  Anyway.  All right.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, before the break, you said you had something on the Subway Superman.  Does everyone remember the story?  This became a national thing.  Yes.  Stupid Subway Superman.  Jumping on some guy that fell onto the tracks to save him.  Guy fell on the tracks.  He was having a seizure.  He fell off the platform and onto the tracks.  Apparently, he fell in between the rails. 
[01:14:30]  See, in my world, if you're having a seizure, you fall onto the tracks.  I'm thinking damaged goods.  Bah.  Bah.  Not worth it.  What am I going to do?  Hot chick.  Hot chick.  Worth it.  Worth saving.  Yeah.  A new mother.  I think worth saving.  Seizure guy.  Damaged goods.  Ah.  But he fell on there.  And then Subway guy, Subway Superman, as they called him, decides to jump on top of him  and hold him down while the train rolled over both of them. 
[01:15:00]  And he has since been on talk shows and got to go to the State of the Union address and  was introduced by the president.  He's like Zelig.  Yeah.  Every time you turn the television on, you see this idiot in some other scene.  There he was.  That's a great reference, by the way.  And tripping over his references.  Oh, he's the worst, too.  I loved Zelig, by the way.  He really does not come off as the brightest individual.  But, you know, hey, he's Subway Superman. 
[01:15:30]  And he seems like a nice guy.  He's a brave guy.  Nice enough guy.  And, of course, you know, Subway Superman, he's getting a problem with lawyers.  Of course.  They're just, they're such scumbags.  All of them.  Mm-hmm.  He allegedly cut a deal with two lawyers.  They pressured him into signing a deal that would pay them 50% of whatever he gets for  selling his story.  50%.  50%.  50%.  And they said that one of them was too aggressive in trying to get cash. 
[01:16:00]  And that they even called the elementary school he was going to speak and demanded an appearance fee.  But they said that was his sister.  And they said they were kind of nauseous when she asked them to ask for an appearance fee.  And they think the deal with him is very fair.  They were just doing what him and his family asked them to do.  50%.  50% this lawyer gets for what?  Scumbag lawyers.  They're just the worst.  They wreck everything creative.  And they just, do you know what they are?  They're like little leeches. 
[01:16:30]  It's not about defending the innocent and making sure that the guilty are punished.  They just leech onto everybody.  And they create little loopholes so they can stick their dirty slug faces through and get a few dollars.  Ah!  You mean the little loophole?  Ah!  They're just like little pregnant blood slugs.  Yeah.  They get excited when they discover that loophole in that cage.  I just can't stand them.  They just, there's nothing to respect.  They're pedophiles minus the integrity. 
[01:17:00]  They're a little loophole.  Slug face.  Loophole.  They're ways of just draining you of your cash.  Yeah.  And 50%.  This guy, all right, he's very brave.  You know, jumps on the train tracks.  He's been in the public eye.  And this vulture swoops in and sees, this guy ain't too bright.  You can tell the guy really isn't that bright.  I'm sorry.  He just isn't.  And figures out a way to get him to sign a contract that gives up 50% of his income. 
[01:17:30]  And I understand that maybe the lawyers weren't his fault.  Maybe his family got greedy and demanded the appearance fee because that's what they're saying.  Yeah.  But 50% tells you something.  And this guy, in one moment, did more to help people or humanity than these vultures will ever do.  Yeah.  In all their years of school, what they are, they've just become blood-sucking leeches.  And this guy, in one moment, is a regular guy who does more than they're ever going to do in their lives.  All right.  And, well, you teased that before break. 
[01:18:00]  I teased this, which could be, like you said, Jimmy, story of the week, maybe story of the month.  Do we have the story of the month?  Month's almost over.  I just, maybe Dan or somebody could find that for me.  There's no beating story of the month.  Well, you're right.  We started this bit this month and unfortunately.  This one sucks to be you.  This one?  I think so, yeah.  This one sucks to be you?  No, it could be a sucks to be you.  Well, the headline, it says, he's put out for stud.  Ex-lover says his kid's mom dumped him for mind-blowing sex with Guru. 
[01:18:30]  Guru.  Oh.  Oh.  A guru.  Here's one for the Breakup Hall of Fame.  It reads, a woman walked out on her boyfriend because she said her new lover had a special talent.  Hmm.  We got to get into this today.  Special talent.  He could make her climax using only his mind.  We needed the sound effect.  Can we do it again?  Wow.  You got that, you know.  That is something.  You got that thing that we like to play to make it a little more dramatic? 
[01:19:00]  I don't even know what you're talking about, but let me just ponder that statement for a while.  Yeah.  Just the mind.  How would a, how would a, I can't, maybe I heard wrong.  What did you say?  Oh, right.  A woman walked out on her boyfriend because she said her new lover had a special talent.  He could make her climax using only his mind.  Wow. 
[01:19:30]  Only his mind.  That's right.  Only his mind.  Wow.  Savage animal.  That's right.  Only his mind.  By the way, on this story and the other paper, the one of the line is he's suing her for a million because he's saying she used him and that he's claiming she just got pregnant before running off with a man who was better endowed. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, you don't mind that stereotype now, do you?  Oh, that's right.  What was this guy's name?  We don't know for sure if it was the Negro.  Do you have this guy's name?  The, uh, the guy who got dumped?  Yeah, if you could freaking read Chinese.  Oh, God. 
[01:20:30]  Quack bomb.  Oh, he's an Asian gentleman.  He's dumped for someone.  And he's dumped for someone who's better endowed.  All right.  Such is the tale told by Quack Fong.  Say it with me.  Such is the tale told by Quack Fong.  Quack Fong.  You got to exaggerate in the middle of the Chinese words.  Such is the tale told by Quack Fong. 
[01:21:00]  Quack Fong.  Who is suing the mother of his child for dumping him for an Arizona cycling stud.  Oh, boy.  Who allegedly possessed the unusual sexual gift.  Uh, Fong.  Quack Fong accuses Petkova of duping him into getting her pregnant, then dumping him after meeting Guy Compton in Arizona.  Guy Compton?  I'm Guy Compton.  Lyle.  I'm Guy Compton. 
[01:21:30]  Lyle.  This is my wife, Julie Compton.  And my kids, Dana Compton.  Don't mess with Guy Compton.  When you hear a name like Guy Compton.  Hi, I'm Guy Compton.  Bill Hartman comes to mind.  Yeah.  Hi, I'm Guy Compton.  Guy Compton, you just lay there, and I'm going to use my mind on you.  I'm all-American Guy Compton.  I'm Guy Compton.  Now with sports, it's Guy Compton.  This poor guy, that's the mother of his kid. 
[01:22:00]  And for the rest of the years, he has to look at this pig and realize she dumped him for a guy who was just better in the sack.  Better in the sack.  Guy Compton.  Well, Petkova returned from a 10-day guided bicycle trip in 2003 and told...  Guided missile, apparently.  Returned from a 10-day guided bicycle trip and told that she had met someone else that could make her... 
[01:22:30]  Can we say this?  We can say it.  Sure.  What?  Hold on to your hats, people.  Uh-oh.  She had met someone else that could make her cervic orgasmic just by thinking...  And that FOM was sexually inadequate.  Oh.  Well, if you can't make a girl, satisfy a girl like that with your mind, that doesn't make you sexually inadequate. 
[01:23:00]  Jesus.  Believe me, it was not just his mind.  No, believe me, I know.  When you're talking about that poor little Asian gentleman...  I mean, there's a picture of him in the paper.  Why he would want a picture of himself in the paper is beyond me after that type of degradation.  But, you know, they're not known as being, well, like a Guy Compton.  Here's what happened.  Whatever his name is.  Guy Compton.  Guy Compton.  Found some new real estate that she didn't know existed because of FOM? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's like, that's fair?  I'm like, yes.  Yes.  Yes, you silly goose.  He has big smiley teeth.  I bet he smiles the whole time he's plowing her.  I am Guy Compton.  Guy Compton.  Are you ready for your orgasm?  Are you enjoying this?  I bet you are.  Is that Heather Mills dancing, by the way, off the subject on TV?  Yeah.  She's a very good dancer.  It's ridiculous.  Like, look.  Look at her move.  How does she do it?  How does that knee bend?  And how do they cheer for her? 
[01:24:00]  All she's doing now is raking one of the Beatles over the coals, and they're cheering for her.  All right.  In court papers, the Jackson Heights Queens man charged that Petkova announced at Thanksgiving  dinner...  Oh, my God.  Probably right in front of everybody.  Oh, she's like drunk.  ...at Thanksgiving dinner that she was ditching him for someone who could afford to buy an apartment  in Manhattan.  You are inadequate.  That's what you are inadequate.  Mm, Guy Compton is like this drumstick on turkey. 
[01:24:30]  Just degrading the poor lad.  Thanksgiving.  Oh, boy.  Right over Thanksgiving.  It's funny.  They were thinking of things to be thankful for.  She just blurted out Guy Compton.  Guy Compton.  Compton, who could not be reached for a comment...  Of course I can't.  I'm busy.  ...is identified in court papers as an employee for Black Roads, Inc., a travel company that  caters to outdoor enthusiasts.  Yeah.  He's all in shape. 
[01:25:00]  I'm Guy Compton, your guide for the day.  Just use my mind on you.  It was a bicycle excursion, right?  Yeah.  Probably Guy Compton said, there's no use for that seat.  You don't need a seat.  This will warm you up for what's going to happen to you later.  For Guy Compton.  Oh.  Guy Compton plowed the wig off her.  Guy Compton rules.  He certainly does.  Left that poor little Asian guy out in the cold. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, you know, he was awful.  With that little...  Oh, I'm sure.  He was awful.  Kissed her with his dry lips.  Oh.  Tried to talk dirty.  It was terrible.  She's a Russian girl.  She probably had a white slavery ring.  I mean, I'm just guessing, but...  Yeah.  A Negro.  She needs somebody like Guy Compton.  Yeah.  He's in great shape in Arizona riding a bicycle with his good skin.  I'm sure the Asian guy out there didn't even come close to where he was supposed to be at that moment.  I'm raising my hand.  Yeah.  We're missing all the obvious jokes. 
[01:26:00]  That's why we got the greatest listeners in radio.  And we truly do.  That's why we got this instant feedback.  We know you guys are good for some great lines on a daily basis.  Gaspuda from Philly.  The paper got it all wrong.  She left her hubby for a guy from Compton.  Ah.  That makes sense.  A Negro.  Actually, that came in from a bunch of different people.  Also, Bill from Waterford had that line.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, listen. 
[01:26:30]  Let me get this story straight.  He uses his brain waves to make her scream.  Yeah.  Supposedly, she climaxes, and he doesn't even touch her.  He uses his mind.  And I don't think she's touching.  It's just she's...  Yeah.  We want to know a little more about this.  Has this happened to the ladies?  Can this happen to the ladies?  We need more info.  Well, all I know is that he ought to meet my wife, because she's always screwing with my mind.  Wow.  Hmm.  Wow. 
[01:27:00]  Chris, you were so excited, too, weren't you?  Yeah.  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  Guys.  Hold on.  Crap, wait, we've got...  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'd tell you something.  How does that not go in?  Yeah.  Razzle-dazzle.  Yeah, that was a razzle-dazzle, of course.  Yes, Jimmy.  I wanted to reach into the prize closet for that guy.  I wanted to reach into the prize closet.  You're not going to get the opportunity.  We have a coroner's bumpy skull. 
[01:27:30]  He hung up on himself, and hopefully now he's just hanging himself.  A pile of dung in there to give away.  Joe from Da Bronx.  Yo.  What's up with Da Bronx listening to this show and loving it?  I don't get it.  I just want to say, Guy Compton's a sexual Jedi.  Sexual Jedi.  Or she's lying.  Maybe she's lying because...  Well, that's why we need to hear from the ladies, Jimmy.  Is this possible?  No.  I mean, look...  You will have the big O.  I will...  I'm very good with my head. 
[01:28:00]  I am with my...  Like, believe me, between the years is all I have going for me.  Sexually, it's the only thing that really puts you to the top.  So you can definitely use your head to bring a girl where she normally wouldn't go.  Do you love the fact that no one's arguing with you?  No.  How can they?  Usually you try to help your pal out and go,  Oh, Jimmy, that's not true.  Here's what I'm thinking.  You know what I'm saying.  Here's the...  Here's what I'm thinking with Guy Compton.  You have to say it right.  Here's what I'm thinking with Guy Compton.  I think Guy Compton doesn't just stand there dressed at the supermarket with a girl and look at her, 
[01:28:30]  and his eyes go all swirly like he's wearing x-ray specs.  And, you know, girls just start falling on the floor.  And, you know, you need to...  Clean up an aisle, too.  It's a mess over here.  People are slipping.  Looks like someone spilled cod oil.  I'm sure it's not like that.  But if you get this woman who's probably not been satisfied with her Asian counterpart there, 
[01:29:00]  in bed, in a sexual situation, she's nude.  Guy Compton is naked.  And he's kind of working around her, very close proximity to certain areas.  Maybe you could feel Guy Compton's breath on certain areas of her body, and he's talking to her and stuff.  Then I think maybe she could probably feel like she gets so worked up that she finds herself in a climax. 
[01:29:30]  Or while Guy is knee-deep.  Who?  Guy Compton.  Of course, Jimmy.  Well, Guy Compton.  Is that the mess you can do?  Yeah, Guy Compton.  I don't do voices.  What do I know?  That sounds...  It's Guy Compton.  Guy Compton.  Guy Compton.  Well, you know, what happens, they probably kiss, and then Guy Compton. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Would, you know, while he's having sex with her, he's probably talking to her, which is the mental part.  Like, he's probably being very dirty and telling her things that, you know, her awful boyfriend was in a horror...  And look, no offense to the Asians, but an Asian paralegal is not talking anybody's underpants off.  No.  Unless it's in a lawsuit.  So you think there was actual sex going on?  There was.  And his mind, you know, him talking to her brought her over the top.  Yes.  We missed something else in this story that, of course, the listeners have to help us out. 
[01:30:30]  No, don't tell me there's a Mrs. Compton.  That's right.  No, no, no, no, no.  We read right over it, and we didn't stop and pause and have a little fun with this, so let's try it again.  Guy Compton, who could not be reached for comment, is identified in court papers as an employee for Back Roads Incorporated.  Uh-oh.  Okay, there's the secret.  Back Roads.  This has nothing to do with biking.  Guy Compton. 
[01:31:00]  Wow.  He's so good, he's incorporated.  A travel company that caters to outdoor enthusiasts.  Yeah.  Back Roads.  That's nice.  Why don't you take the back road with Guy Compton?  All right, here's the deal.  Now, we got Heather from Pittsburgh.  You stay there.  We got Matt from Yonkers and a few others.  They're going to talk about this mind-blowing sex thing.  Is it possible?  I'm going to get my girlfriend a gift for Christmas. 
[01:31:30]  Whatever.  I said Christmas.  It's March.  I just had my face smashed with a colostomy bag.  All right.  I'm hanging up on other people so we can get more people to stay on subject here.  Back goes Griffey looking up, and it's out of here!  Yeah!  Or is it?  Well, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  Kiss my fat ass! 
[01:32:00]  Woo!  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll go to the phones next.  There's no real good way to do this, so just do what you do.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.

Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  A lot of people want to talk about Guy Compton.  The amazing Guy Compton who can stimulate a woman with his mind. 
[01:33:30]  Without even touching her.  He's amazing.  Try it at home, man.  It's fun to say the name.  Guy Compton.  Guy Compton.  Jimmy?  Guy Compton.  No, really try to say it because it's even funnier when you're really trying.  Guy Compton.  Yeah.  Now you're sounding all man.  I need more time.  Just think Phil Hartman.  I know I'm not doing the greatest Phil Hartman, but I got the rhythm down.  It's Guy Compton.  I'm Guy Compton. 
[01:34:00]  Guy Compton.  Hi.  I'm Guy Compton.  What's your name?  Oh, you're shivering.  Other scenarios where you want to hear the name Guy Compton.  You want him to be your pilot.  Right.  I'm Guy Compton.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Guy Compton on the flight deck,  and we should be landing shortly.  Hope you had a nice flight.  Remember, I'm Guy Compton.  And God bless America.  Keeping you safe. 
[01:34:30]  You want Guy Compton.  If there's a fire, that's what you want leading your group as you search for an exit?  Right.  I don't know what to do, but Guy Compton will.  Guy Compton will get us out of this.  He's in charge.  Follow me, everybody.  I'm Guy Compton.  Would you follow Guy Compton or Steve?  Steve.  Oh, Guy Compton.  Guy Compton.  Then again, if you want to cheat on your math test, you ignore Guy Compton.  No, you've got a tang pong.  Of course you do.  You go for old, that rotten, inadequate. 
[01:35:00]  He's using his penis as a pencil eraser.  Well, it's all about Lindsay in Boston today.  She's calling for the third time.  Lindsay, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  I doesn't get the hint.  I know, I know, I know.  Why don't you hop into an escalade and go to a late night party?  Oh, hey, hey.  Wow.  That's what you get.  Wow.  That's what you get.  Really?  So, Lindsay, we try again because now you've had another hour.  What is Boston talking about this morning?  Absolutely nothing. 
[01:35:30]  I'm sitting in traffic listening to you guys, and I just wanted to say that that woman is  insane.  I have sex, like, eight times a day.  I have to have it all the time, and there's no way that my boyfriend could look at me with  his mind or just think with his mind and make me do something like that.  Well, you have to have it all the time.  That's cool.  Way to deal with childhood episodes.  Healthy.  Hey, how old are you?  22.  And do you really have it eight times a day?  I seriously, before I go to work, before my boyfriend goes to work when I get home, 
[01:36:00]  when he comes home, I have to have it all the time.  Are you a hot broad?  I'm pretty hot.  Is your name Lindsay Compton?  No, it's actually a French weird name.  Well, don't worry about it.  What's the hottest part on your body?  My boobs.  Yeah, how big are those boobs?  They're Ds.  22 with Ds.  Natural?  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And give us that other number.  The other number's key.  The Ds are always nice, but let's hear the number.  34.  Perfect.  Well, not perfect.  36 is right there, too.  People would argue 34 better than 36.  Some would like 36 over 34.  Well, I used to be a double D, but now they're just, you know.  Lost a little weight, did you?  Yeah, well, I had two kids, so.  What?  Two kids?  All right. 
[01:37:00]  She's 20 what?  Two.  22 with two kids.  Boy, what happened to her?  Ah, let's go to Matt in Yonkers.  Matt, what's up?  Let's be from Salvi.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Hi.  All right.  How are you?  Gravy.  Yeah, there's this Chinese method of energy orgasms, and it sounds really kooky, but I've  seen videos of it, and it's just this older, thin guy putting his hand in front of, you  know, women's junk, but these girls are having screaming, like, full-on crying orgasms. 
[01:37:30]  You've seen videos of it, exactly.  Probably made by the people who want to sell the videos.  Yeah.  That energy stuff, dude, it's the same stuff they use to help you stop smoking, like where  they put their hands over you, and there isn't energy.  Mr. Miyagi.  There's something to it.  Or you could feel a little heat.  Maybe, but you're not going to scream an orgasm because, you know, some skinny delivery  man is standing with his hands over your groin.  Yeah, they could be faking that there.  Exactly.  Matt?  That's true. 
[01:38:00]  I mean, we should have an experiment in studio with a girl we know that wouldn't fake it,  and then see if this is real.  Put your hands over her, just do that.  Yeah.  All right, thank you, sir.  She could go out and win the karate tournament.  I remember my friend Russell made me laugh very hard when we were in, like, seventh grade  because there was this red-headed girl, Christine, and we were waiting to get on the bus, and  her hair was so red that Russell just stood behind her and rubbed his hands together like  it was a fire, and he was warming his hands, and I remember that 20 years later, and I still  giggle.  Your friends were all asses.  They were just... 
[01:38:30]  And then he had a fist fight with her years later, I remember, a fist fight.  With a girl?  Oh, yeah.  Did he beat her up?  Pretty good.  I remember he was hitting her pretty good.  She was taking a good-ass weapon.  That's what you get, tomboy.  My old friend, Chris Gates, used to take on broads in the schoolyard.  I'm like, what?  And I was...  It was grammar school, and I knew there was just something very wrong with that.  But the girls were up for the challenge, and man, did they get their ass kicked.  Yeah.  By the way, redhead girls, they try harder because of the red hair. 
[01:39:00]  It's true, and the little freckles.  They don't want to shave because of the freckles.  They're a little ashamed, so they try a little harder.  Yeah.  Same with the girls with the tiny little boobies.  Yeah.  Aw.  They give up a lot more because they got tiny little boobies.  Hi, I'm a carrot-headed zilch.  I know, it's okay.  A lot of guys have that red-headed fetish.  They like a brown red, not butta douchey red.  Not Ronald McDonald red.  You know, Nicole Kidman in her younger years, red, nice. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Ronald McDonald red, where it's all just beyond curly.  Is that natural?  Yeah, girls like that.  Yeah, it is.  Because I know old ladies, for some reason, like to dye that cotton candy head of theirs,  that Ronald McDonald red, and walk around and go, oh, stop it.  It's just that stupid little orphan Annie type of red.  Oh, okay.  It's just a curly head of red whatever it is.  Yeah.  A mess.  Hey, someone wants to do their Guy Compton impression.  It's Brett from Edmonton.  Brett!  How's it going, boys? 
[01:40:00]  Hey.  I'm actor Guy Compton.  You might know me from such self-help videos as How to Steal a Dry Claw's Wife and Mind-Blowing Sex.  I gotta say for this guy, that might have been okay, but your phone crapped out.  It was a dry blank swipe because your phone crapped out.  Yeah.  Yeah, but that was, by the way, the second bomb of the day, both from Canada.  And you know what?  We broke our rule. 
[01:40:30]  Yep.  The rule is only one.  You get one phone call a day, Canada.  And we'll know because of that wacky accent of yours.  I'm Guy Compton, eh?  Hey, Guy Compton, you know.  Let's go to Rob in Rhode Island.  Rob?  Hey, boys.  What's up?  Hey, Rob.  Picture your grandmother naked being mentally stimulated by Guy Compton.  No, you don't want to see that.  I like that.  Watch it out, boys.  I like that you brought back the picture your grandma naked bit. 
[01:41:00]  I can picture Guy Compton.  Picture your grandmother with Guy Compton.  Uh-huh.  The house dress is hiked up, and he's just, he's doing what you know he does best in a place  She's never had it, and he's spanking her.  Ooh.  A really good spanking.  And all you hear is her going, oh, and the charm bracelet shaking.  The charm bracelet.  Well, let's say hi to Jared.  Jared in Boston, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Anthony, you had a line that totally got nothing.  Ooh, what happened?  Well, that 22-year-old Hua that called, she said, you know, I had two kids, and he said, 
[01:41:30]  she must be from Southie.  I got a good loft.  Oh, good, yeah.  That was for you, Boston.  All right, let's go to Maine.  They have nothing better to do in Maine than go with this mine stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  It's Aspen.  What's up, Aspen?  Not much.  How are you guys doing?  Were your parents big skiers?  No, actually, it wasn't.  My name's Aspen Armani, which is pretty hot, if you ask me.  Aspen Armani.  Wow, that's a stripper name.  Is that your real name? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, it is.  You must love Paris Hilton.  That's a stripper name.  No, God, no, I don't.  I'm not a hoa, so I can understand where this girl comes from by being stimulated by the  mind.  Yeah?  I used to be a ninfo, got a divorce after nine years, and haven't had it in a very, very  time, and I've actually stimulated by guys talking more than guys trying to get down my  pants, so I can definitely understand why this girl...  All right, that's all well and good, but this story's claiming that this girl had an orgasm 
[01:42:30]  and the guy didn't even touch her and she wasn't doing anything.  Oh, believe me, MySpace is a good thing for a girl who doesn't go out and get ass.  Do you look good?  Yeah, I have a MySpace if you want to go check out me and my girls.  Yeah.  Yeah, we love the MySpace.  All right, let's go.  It is...  Well, you can just search for Aspen in Maine and I'm sure I'll pop up, but...  Well, don't you want to give you a real MySpace address out?  Yeah, just give it.  This is an opportunity to have...  Oh, yeah, really.  I'd love a bunch of you guys. 
[01:43:00]  MySpace.com slash what?  What?  Oh, my God.  It's under my friend's name.  It's MySpace.com.  Andrea Travis.  A-N-D-R-I-A.  Travis.  Hit me up.  Oh, my God.  All right, hold on the line.  We're going to see if you're hot.  You're going to take the MySpace challenge.  Yeah, we have a Travis here.  All right, hold on.  And we got Teresa from Port Jefferson.  Teresa.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  So you think this is possible with the whole mind thing?  Definitely possible.  It's called phone sex. 
[01:43:30]  No.  Yes, because if she's using his mind, talking to you.  No, man.  It's a whole different thing.  Oh, she hung up.  Aspen hung up.  Yeah.  All right, Teresa.  You got to be our friend to see any of the pictures.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That dumb thing.  That profile is set to private.  Profile is set to private.  I'm too important.  All right.  Why don't we move on to other things?  We wanted to hear from the girls about this mind thing.  Uh-oh.  Does Kathy and Boston have something? 
[01:44:00]  Waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  All righty.  Wow, there's four girls in Aspen's picture.  And you know what?  I think.  I hope it's not the one all the way on the left.  I think there's four girls.  The old fat friend has to get in there, huh?  That is all lumbered.  That better not be Aspen Armani.  Oh, boy.  I would say.  Looks like she might have ate a moose. 
[01:44:30]  I'd say she's the second one in.  I'm going to go.  The one next to her.  Because she said she's Italian.  And her name's Aspen Armani.  And that kind of looks like an Aspen Armani.  Yeah, she's got the nice eyes.  The other one's a red head that we were just goofing on with the hair.  The red, red hair.  And then the one all the way to the right looks like she gets along well with the one all the way on the left.  I've never seen.  It's like four threes.  No, I mean, she's like a mess. 
[01:45:00]  The second one in isn't bad.  Aspen Armani.  I need to.  I'll go.  I'll go.  We got pictures of four girls.  I'll go two, six and a half, six, two.  No.  You can't go two with the one on the left and two with the one all the way on the right.  Three?  You got to give her a 2.5 or something.  All right.  A little more than the one on the left. 
[01:45:30]  Or just put the one on the left as a one.  Let's go to Kathy in Boston.  What's up with Boston today?  Hi.  Bruce Mitton says we suck.  I don't understand all these phone calls from Boston.  Boys, boys, I have some advice for you.  Go after yourself.  Shut up.  He said that?  Oh, he sent some dumb email.  As a listener, I'm not feeling it lately.  Well, you're also pushing 60.  Get lost.  Feel it.  You didn't feel it when we were freaking trying to do a talk show back in the day when you were the GM.  Shut up. 
[01:46:00]  Grab a phone book, put it in your driver's seat, and drive into an abutment.  Go play golf with Greg Hill and leave us alone.  And then he emails Super Agent Bob Eatman.  Go away.  We're doing just fine without you.  We've done just fine without you over the years.  Were he sent you guys an email or a mass email?  Well, it was to myself and Anthony.  Just garbage.  Don't hear from the guy for a year, and then he sends an email.  I'm not feeling it as a listener.  I see ulterior motives. 
[01:46:30]  Of course.  He's affiliated with somebody.  Kathy, what's up?  Hi.  I just got to say, the thought of having sex with my boyfriend gets me a little bit excited.  Yeah?  No.  Excited?  Yes.  Yeah, see?  It's a buildup.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, we got so distracted because on Good Morning America, they're doing just quality TV this morning.  Teens fighting back.  Just yell fire prevents attacks. 
[01:47:00]  I love the fact that you show girls doing these, like, pseudo-spin karate moves, and you forget that in a real conflict, there's a grown man punching you in the face.  Right.  Yeah, that guy that they're demonstrating with isn't going to hold.  Hold on.  Or, Kathy, we'll get back.  He's holding back, you know?  Now, grab my arm.  Okay.  Now, twist.  Well, what they showed was a girl at an ATM.  Yeah.  And, you know, next thing you know, a really big guy approaches from behind and grabs her neck, and they show the teen slowly turning, and she's kind of throwing a little side punch thing, and that's supposed to make the guy go away. 
[01:47:30]  Fire.  Yell fire.  That's a smart thing to do, though, because people look when you yell fire.  People don't want to get involved when you yell help.  Rape or, yeah, help.  They don't want to get involved, but you yell fire.  That's probably society we live in.  That's what you're supposed to do.  But the thing is, if you're standing in an ATM like that, it's not a guy that's going to come up behind you and put you in a hold where you can then spin around and punch.  He's probably just going to punch you right upside the side of your head, just belt you as hard as he can in the side of your head. 
[01:48:00]  You'll be there going, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, and then you'll be unconscious.  Right.  You should go to the drive-thru ATMs if you can find one.  I used to always go to one, the drive-thru ATM.  But you've got to keep an eye on your side view mirror.  Oh, yeah, but at least.  And you look and look at some of the time people creep up there.  But at least, yeah, but you're still less vulnerable there than you are walking back to the car.  At least you're in the car.  I like going into a bank.  Into a bank.  That's what I do.  During business hours.  If I had your money, I would, too.  Just go in there and go into the vault and dance naked. 
[01:48:30]  All right, we got a great phone call coming in.  So that was a distraction.  Yeah.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Ah!  Yeah, because the guy's committing.  All he wants is your money.  So for you to turn around and do some kind of spin punch is stop telling people that  you could fight back.  In slow motion.  The smartest thing is to just give up your dumb possession or your money and save your life.  Well, that might have been about an assault, though.  I don't know if that was about a robbery.  I don't think they were saying fight back a robbery.  They showed it in front of an ATM machine.  Like, you know, the guy would want the money, don't you think? 
[01:49:00]  No, I think that was a rape thing.  You think?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, because they were showing some footage of some girl walking, and I  think she's in the studio.  I think she yelled fire or whatever and got away from the guy.  You know, there's a scam going on with ATMs where a guy will put this little clear plastic  gizmo.  It's just bent up plastic in where you put your card, and it can only be done on those  machines that take your card, which I hate.  Yeah.  You put those ATMs and it steals your card for a while, and it gives it back once the 
[01:49:30]  money comes out, but you put your card in there, and it takes it, but this thing that  they put in holds it in one spot, and you can't see it.  The machine hasn't taken it, but then the guy comes up and assists you and says, oh, what  you got to do is put your PIN number in twice and hit enter, and then he stands watching over  your shoulder as you do it twice.  Who falls for that crap?  Exactly.  That's what I said. 
[01:50:00]  But they do.  But people fall for it.  And then the card doesn't come out because it's being held by the little gizmo, and then  the guy leaves, and then the perpetrator comes back, pulls the gizmo out with the card.  Now he's got the card and the PIN number.  How does he get the gizmo out, but you can't?  Because you don't see it.  It's clear plastic that fits over the slot, and it's bent in a V.  So the V fits all the way in the slot, and barely a little ridge keeps it from sliding 
[01:50:30]  all the way in.  And when you put your card in, it grabs it, but the little V piece of plastic holds it.  And it's one of these little put-together scams.  And then all he does is pull this plastic piece out that looks like the faceplate of  the thing you're putting in, putting the card in.  And he's got the card and your PIN number.  Who's standing there, though?  Oh, that's the scam, too.  He goes, that's it.  Sorry.  It takes more fingers than just your own to do this. 
[01:51:00]  So he goes, I have to hold down these buttons.  You hold down these and put your PIN in with the other hand.  And people are buying into the fact that there's an ATM expert just waiting.  Just waiting.  Knowing that there's going to be a problem.  And that's why he's got to stand right over you is because he's got to hold a couple of  buttons.  You've got to hold a couple and then put your PIN in.  And they don't want to be rude because someone's helping them.  Yeah, they're helping.  You know what, though?  If you're that stupid, then whatever.  You deserve it.  You deserve your bank account emptied.  I just got an email from PayPal. 
[01:51:30]  It said, a new address has been authorized for your account.  And it's got the address.  And, of course, it's not my address.  I got that one, too.  Did you?  Yes.  And then it has, click this link to verify address.  And you look and go, that's not my address.  Who's my account?  And instantly, I know it's a scam.  But you look at the link.  You put your cursor over the link. 
[01:52:00]  And you see it doesn't even go to PayPal.  It goes to some numeric, whatever they call it there.  IP.  Yeah.  It goes to some numeric thing.  It's not even the right address.  And it goes to a page that looks like PayPal, that has a login page.  And you're supposed to put in your name and password and hit send.  Who's falling for this crap?  You almost did.  And we had to tell you this is a scam, Anthony. 
[01:52:30]  Well, yeah.  I want it to be helpful.  Hey, this is all well and good.  But this guy, Rick from Long Island.  Rick.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How's it going?  This could be the phone call of the day.  And you could get a prize if you do it right.  Oh.  This is the challenge I have for you today, Rick.  What you're about to say, if you say it as is, no one's going to hear it.  Al's going to dump out.  Although the XM's.  You have to be creative.  I get that.  Let's try to work with it. 
[01:53:00]  Although the XM's will hear it if you screw up.  But, Rick, go ahead.  Okay.  Now, first of all, you guys are talking about women having, reaching their peaks.  Yes.  That's good.  Right there is good.  Reaching their peaks.  Without any physical involvement.  Right.  Okay.  And as far as a mental situation.  Okay.  Now, this happened with me and my girlfriend.  Okay.  And to boot, she, let's say, you know when you have a squirt gun?  You have a squirt gun and the squirt gun can go.  Well, there's that situation as well. 
[01:53:30]  Okay.  So, when she does reach her peak, there's a squirt gun involved.  Anyway, that's all I know.  It was pretty amazing.  B-Rock, make sure all this is going through.  I got a prize for the guy if he does this successfully.  I'm going to maybe.  You might be out already?  I'm a little leery that he's still in.  I'm a little leery that he's still in.  All right.  Let's go, Rick.  Okay.  So, you're with me so far with that.  Now, I like the type of stimulation that, let's say, two men like sometimes. 
[01:54:00]  Okay.  Fair.  Good.  All right.  So far, one dump.  They didn't like your analogy.  That's the question.  No.  Your analogy wasn't going to work.  All right.  Well, can you say this?  Like, after you have a certain, like, let's just say you have a good time together.  Uh, your bed looks like a tsunami hit it.  That can mean anything.  Yeah, I like that.  You're watching a movie and, uh, you know, you reach for your beverage and all of a sudden 
[01:54:30]  it's spilled all over the place.  It spilled all over the place.  And your bed is soaked because you spilled.  We have no idea what happened.  Right.  Actually, your wife spilled all over, uh, the bed.  Uh, she reached over for something and, uh, her cup fell over.  All right.  Hey, uh, Rick, why don't you just leave it to the professionals here?  What Rick wants to tell everyone today is that his girlfriend was doing him with a strap  on and she orgasmed.  Oh.  And it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was the 
[01:55:00]  type of thing.  I don't think that's going to work.  What happened?  No?  No.  So, uh, Rick, yeah, we're having a tough time with your phone call.  Unfortunately, I still think he should deserve a prize though.  He's not an FCC expert.  He did.  Okay.  Well, basically.  Yeah.  But we need to, uh, Anthony, you're very good.  What, what's the deal?  Make it as vague as all right.  Um, uh, Rick and his girlfriend were being amorous with each other.  Uh, she was using something that, uh, almost looks like a parachute harness. 
[01:55:30]  Uh, without the parachute or the pesky shoulder straps, just the one part.  And, um, instead of a rip cord, there's something else hanging from it.  Yeah.  Uh, and, uh, she apparently, and Rick enjoy this type of action where she gets to see if 
[01:56:00]  Rick has a bald spot.  If what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  Right.  And she, uh.  And this guy gets her so worked up that she winds up, um, having a, uh, uh, perfect time.  Yeah.  Which, which is.  With no involvement from, uh, herself or him.  No, just the plain fact that she's doing this.  Yeah.  And helping out her, uh, boyfriend, Rick. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  That she just, uh.  Yeah.  And she winds up spilling her drink all over the place.  That's right.  There you go.  Who knew she was drinking sardine oil?  Hey, uh, Rick, you like Bob Saget?  Uh, he's all right.  Holy crap.  Have you ever seen him do stand-up?  Never.  Are you a fan of stand-up?  Yes.  I'm going to do you the biggest favor today.  You're going to be really surprised.  He was on the O&A Traveling Virus comedy, uh, comedy tour last year. 
[01:57:00]  He's going to be on it this year.  We're going to announce all the dates when we do the, uh, the Vegas show April 14th at  the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  Tickets still available, by the way, Jimmy, through Ticketmaster.com.  All the info is up on our website, but we've got like nine comedians.  We're flying out to Vegas, uh, doing the show on the 14th, having a press conference,  and we're going to announce all the other dates.  But, uh, don't pay attention to all that because I don't want to confuse you.  We're going to send you to see Bob Saget.  Excellent.  At, uh, North Fork Theater, Friday, April 20th. 
[01:57:30]  Okay?  Awesome.  I'm telling you.  And then you're going to call me or call us on that Monday and thank us because, uh,  I'm telling you, his stand-up is unbelievable.  It's, it's, you're going to be very, very surprised how dirty this guy really is.  Yeah, I've heard, I've heard good things.  I've just never seen, you know, but that's, that's awesome.  That's great, guys.  Thanks.  All right.  Hold on the line.  We're going to, uh, get your info and send out the tickets to you.  Okay?  Okay.  Cool.  Thanks.  All right.  Uh, there goes Rick.  Did we get the story out there?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That's pretty, I think that would, that's, that's, that gets you going a little bit that 
[01:58:00]  she gets so into that that she's, uh, you know what?  She's just, just in a froth.  Like she can't believe she's doing what she's doing.  See, the thing is, like I told you one time when I was in Vegas, there's a nomination  which I used to see, uh, nurse pig.  And, uh, that was the name she would use.  Her name was nurse pig?  Yeah.  She would come out, um, of the bathroom in a nurse's outfit.  And I believe that she really didn't have a medical license.  I questioned her.  Huh.  I wanted to dress like a male nurse and smother me.  Did I ever use that joke?  It's one of my favorites. 
[01:58:30]  She was 300 pounds.  Her name was Edward.  She had a beard.  And, uh, she made me pretend I was 80.  And then she, the angel of death put me out of my mercy.  Out of my, put me out of my mercy.  Out of your mercy.  Um, so, um, um, um, a nurse pig came out one time in a nurse's outfit, but, uh, it's somewhat  unicorn-like.  Right.  And doing her best unicorn impression.  And boy, guess where she wanted to sprinkle fairy dust.  Oh, boy.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah. 
[01:59:00]  What happened to that guy?  Where's that guy?  And I was, uh, I was a little nervous about it.  But I'm like, okay, I'm gonna let you.  It was so sexy to see her like that.  Wow.  But, uh, when the moment of truth came, I kind of backed out.  I was like, uh, well, yeah.  Well.  I fronted her. 
[01:59:30]  And, uh, I was like, nah, don't do that.  And she was like, okay, but what a professional.  Because she didn't even miss a beat.  She just started spitting on me.  It's a true story.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  I can't wait for the book.  Fun in Rome.  Jimmy's gonna have a great book out.  Oh, yeah.  Details to come.  And one of the listeners, I think, gave me the title.  Can you say it?  Oh, yeah.  I'm gonna use, uh, sorry the pages are stuck together.  That is a good one.  Hey, that's really good.  That tells it all.  Yeah.  That's really good, Jimmy.  I like that one.  Very cool.  All right, uh, point at Iraq, will ya? 
[02:00:00]  No.  Please?  Yeah.  Let's go.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, all right, all right.  We're rocking.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Miranda, not happy.  Why?  What's wrong, Miranda? 
[02:00:30]  Well, you always make fun of redheads.  I'm a redhead.  Yeah, sure you are.  Well, it's more kind of like, uh, strawberry blonde.  It gets a little mousy in the winter, but then in the summer, it kind of gets very blonde.  Well, you know, I mean, I'm a strawberry blonde.  Aw.  And I'm far from a dog.  I mean, uh, I look like Susan Sarandon before she hit the wall.  She hit the wall 20 years ago.  What, are you looking at her in Rocky Horror?  Shut up.  No, I'm talking about when she said Bill's alone. 
[02:01:00]  She didn't hit the wall then.  Notice the excitement?  Yeah.  I never thought she was hot.  That's how much you must be popular on Match.com.  A young, virile Susan Sarandon.  Yeah.  No, I'm not on Match.com.  She had saggy boobs at 25.  Well, I don't have saggy boobs, and I'm not 25.  Hey, do you know a sexy Roz Abram?  Can you find me one of those?  All right, what's the deal with you there, Miranda?  What's the problem?  Well, you make fun of Red Heads.  You just called nurses pigs. 
[02:01:30]  I'm a nurse.  Well, can I tell you something?  Sure.  This is why you're irritating me.  And this is why you're a nurse, by the way.  This is why you're not a doctor, because you're kind of stupid.  Nurse Pig.  We weren't calling nurses pigs.  Nurse Pig was the name that this dominatrix would use when she came out in her nurse's costume.  That was her name that she gave herself.  That's what Jimmy said.  Nurse Pig is here.  So you misunderstood.  I misunderstood.  I just said, I went through a dead block in the radio.  But now I apologize. 
[02:02:00]  I do enjoy you guys every day, I have to say.  Do you really?  Where are you calling from?  No, I listen to you every day.  Where are you calling from, Miranda?  I'm calling from Morris County, New Jersey.  Oh, very nice.  And what do you like about the program?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a pig.  Saw that coming.  And we weren't even talking about her kind of red hair.  No.  We were talking about the really just over the top. 
[02:02:30]  Wiry, Ronald McDonald red.  We said that the strawberry blonde red isn't as bad as the Ronald McDonald red.  It's good.  So she was insulted over two things that we didn't really say.  Right.  Or had nothing to do with her.  Yeah.  Like Carrot Top red.  Like that type of a red hair.  Right.  Right.  Who was a very well built man, by the way.  Have you seen his chest?  I mean, no queer jokes.  He is a stacked.  Carrot Top had to get ripped.  Dude, this is the sad part. 
[02:03:00]  Carrot Top could kick your ass.  Oh, yeah.  Could kick all our ass.  He had to.  Drop his money on your foot and break it.  We saw him in the lobby of the MGM in Vegas, and he was going for his third workout of  the day.  The guy is ridiculous.  Really?  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  Girlfriend smoking, too.  Really?  I changed the porn awards because he presented an award at the porn awards.  And lovely.  Lovely girl.  Wow.  Who knew Carrot Top?  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Derek, and we'll do a little clean up, then we'll get out of here.  What's up, Derek? 
[02:03:30]  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I want to talk about something I have with my girlfriend.  Okay.  Can I be rude right now, or do I have to clean it up?  You have to clean it up, sir.  You've got to clean it up.  That's the challenge for you, Derek, right now.  That's what kind of makes it fun.  All right.  Okay.  So I was taking the bus downtown, and she was watching some movie on the computer with 
[02:04:00]  several girls.  Okay.  And I asked to kind of back off, and I wasn't doing anything, and all of a sudden, she peaked  because of just air, just breathing.  Wow.  And watching girls.  Huh.  Yeah.  Okay.  So she's watching on the computer.  But then you aren't even home because you're on a bus, so what's that got to do with anything?  Yeah, you're on the downtown bus.  Well, maybe it was the vibrations from the motor. 
[02:04:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  So there you go.  All right.  It's possible.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye, sweetie.  Later.  Let's go to John from Jersey.  John.  Hello?  Yeah, go ahead, John.  Hi, John.  Am I on the show?  Yes, you are, John.  Yeah, John.  Yes.  I just want to say, you guys' sense of humor is really bad, man.  You make me want to listen to Z100 all the time.  Then go to Z100.  Yeah.  Do you like to do it?  Yeah, why do you guys got to, like, you know, be mean to everybody that calls you on 
[02:05:00]  the show?  Because it's fun.  Why?  You want a nice?  You like to be a little nicer.  I think you'll get more ratings.  You want a nice show, John?  Is that what you like?  Nice people?  Well, you know what?  Maybe he's right.  How old are you?  How old are you, John?  I'm 21.  All right.  You're like a college student, right?  Can I go with the obvious thing here?  When are you coming out of the closet?  All right, man.  I'll talk to you later, bud.  Yeah, of course.  21 years old, a college student.  But I'm glad you like, uh, that's not a sense of humor.  All right, listen.  The video of the day.  It's too mean. 
[02:05:30]  Young man, socially conscious.  Yeah.  Give him a few years.  Give him a few years.  Yeah.  That girl in Boston was socially conscious.  Went to the party.  Hey, can't judge it.  Book bites cover.  I'll get in the Escalade.  Yeah.  What's the matter?  We're going to a bad neighborhood.  No, there aren't bad neighborhoods.  It's not like that.  I think you're.  What?  I'll throw you off.  I think she just.  What?  She was just wanting some action.  She wasn't thinking ahead.  Yeah.  How about some action in a nice neighborhood?  Yeah.  There's plenty of action going on in, uh, uh, Southie, in the North End. 
[02:06:00]  There's plenty of places to go and, and maybe relate with people that won't, uh, take you  where a stray bullet's going to shoot you in the head.  Her ideological ignorance is what got her shot.  Exactly.  She didn't deserve to be shot, of course, but that's what it was.  I think she was just drunk and wasn't thinking.  You know damn well.  I don't think her, uh, her liberalism came into play at all.  A young college person like that?  I think absolutely her liberalism came into play.  Gangbangers?  Are you kidding me?  Absolutely.  Hopping in a, uh, Escalade with gangbangers? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  In a, a, a gang, in gang infested neighborhoods going around.  Well, now.  Stop.  You, you don't think for a second, uh, even no matter how stupid you are with thinking  nothing's going to happen to you, that there isn't this primal thing in your mind that  she didn't think like, uh, oh, maybe I'm not where I should be.  Yeah.  But then the guilty part of her comes out and goes, oh, stop thinking like that.  What's going to happen?  Right in the head.  And then they wait 40 minutes to take her to the hospital. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  She's shot.  She, 10 minutes away.  She doesn't show up at the hospital for 40 minutes.  Maybe not her liberalism.  Yeah.  But her, her, her youthful ideological view on things.  Well, the shot was, uh, for somebody else.  Yeah.  She was, uh, unfortunately in the way.  Here's the story now that you guys brought it to, uh, everyone's attention.  Kiera Levin hadn't worked at the building, or hadn't lived at the building behind me for  very long, but she did take the time this weekend to visit friends and family in Boston.  Sadly, what was supposed to be a celebratory weekend has now turned  into an intense police search for witnesses, witnesses to a crossfire killing. 
[02:07:30]  It's not, uh, snitching.  It's trying to help solve a crime.  Oh, boy.  Hey, you're not a snitching.  There's our old pal.  Snitching.  It's not a snitching.  He's trying to talk like a street person, but to get something to galvanize the youth  into, into tattling?  Yeah.  What a babbling ass.  It's not snitching.  That's what, that's the word you want your mayor to use.  Snitching.  You're a snitch.  Witnesses to a crossfire killing.  It's not, uh, snitching. 
[02:08:00]  It's trying to help solve a crime of an innocent woman.  Even Boston's name.  Of an innocent woman.  Of an innocent.  Over the stray bullet murder that claimed Kiara Levin's young life.  Saturday, the 22-year-old University of Michigan grad was in Boston for a relative's birthday  party, followed by some bar hopping.  By 3 a.m., Levin ended up outside an after-hours party where gunfire broke out.  Boston police now believe the key to finding Levin's killer may lie with a suspected gang  member who checked into the same emergency room where Levin was pronounced dead. 
[02:08:30]  He was also suffering from a bullet wound.  Well, there you go.  They believe, yeah, gang member.  She spoke of four languages.  She's obviously a brilliant girl, university graduate.  Why are you at a party where you're leaving with gang members where there's a shooting  involved in?  Because she can change the world.  This is going to be great.  I'm going to know something about how these people live and I'm going to...  I think you're way off.  I think she was drunk and wanted some action.  You're right too, but it just wasn't thinking. 
[02:09:00]  You think there are girls that...  You think girls that get drunk and want some action and end up in gang members' cars?  There are girls that get drunk, want some action, and go to the local bar.  Or if you're around in Boston with friends, you don't go to Dorchester.  They look at it like jungle habitat.  Like, this is a dangerous thing.  Yeah.  It's a little dangerous adventure, but I'll be okay.  And you're not going to be okay.  Nope.  It's a bad situation.  You're putting yourself in a dangerous place because you think you have that protection 
[02:09:30]  of, I don't know, what you think you have it of.  Yeah.  You're not going to get hurt.  All right.  Bye-bye.  She probably did want to get laid.  Oh, she just wanted the party to keep going and have fun.  But how do you wind up in that neighborhood in a party like that?  I just...  Come on.  I don't know.  You get drunk at a bar and you want to continue, especially in Boston because the stupid bars  close so early.  Because now Mayor Menino wants to shut down after-hour parties.  Well, raise the time that the bars can stay open.  And we'll close the bars at four.  And you'll get rid of a lot of these after-hour parties. 
[02:10:00]  That's the whole thing when you live up there is to go somewhere else.  People want to hang out later than one o'clock in the morning, you dope.  And part of it is that when you're in college, she probably went to a few frat parties and  stuff that was thrown by black fraternities or whatever.  She's like, this is how people get along everywhere.  No, it's not.  No.  Yeah.  It's not the way people interact everywhere.  All right.  More to the story to come.  We want to end on a happy note today.  Video of the day.  We love seeing what the video of the day is. 
[02:10:30]  Today, I think it's the fence plowing thing.  Fence plowing.  Who knew this was going on?  Yeah.  Got to love the kids.  Back in the day, it was just smashing mailboxes before video cameras.  Driving through people's backyards.  M80s in mailboxes.  Knocking down mailboxes.  Maybe take a little toilet paper to someone's front yard.  Yeah.  Throw it around in the trees.  But, man, the kids, they're very creative today.  And the new rage, I guess, or they're trying to say it's the new rage.  I haven't been able to throw this in a search engine yet to see how many videos are out there. 
[02:11:00]  But they're talking about fence plowing.  And this couple out there on, I think it's Long Island.  Yeah.  These kids have targeted this same fence nine times.  Nine times.  You'd think the homeowners at this point would have learned their lesson and maybe have some  kind of, like, steel fence behind the fence.  Something.  Yeah.  Spikes.  Yeah.  Something fun for them to roll into.  Well, fence plowing is where, you know, you get brave enough.  Here's a big guy doing it right here.  Blam.  And you go running as fast as you can right into a fence and just take the whole thing 
[02:11:30]  out.  And they videotape it and throw it up on YouTube and Break.com and such.  These guys are idiots.  It's hilarious, though.  Throw fence plowing into the search engine.  E-Rock's doing it now.  And we're watching this really big kid just go plowing through the fence.  And sometimes it doesn't work too well and you get pretty hurt.  Like this guy.  That one, the flats broke, but the main little beam across the fence section didn't break. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Look at this big guy.  Chugga, chugga, boom, right through it.  White people are just, black kids, why do they hate us?  They don't do this.  This is definitely stupid white kid prank, crime, hijink.  Just white people hiding from a fence.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  And you know it started with just some drunk kid going, I bet I run right through that fence.  Yeah.  Oh, go ahead.  Hey, that's funny.  Let's do it again.  Let's videotape it.  You know why?  Because kids are just bored. 
[02:12:30]  You get bored?  Yeah.  Jeez.  You get bored that you got to do something crazy.  Fence plowing is moronic.  I think we could squeeze this in really fast.  So here's the story.  Teens call it an extreme sport, but it's destroying private property.  Fence plowing has reared its ugly head again, this time in Westbury, Long Island.  Plows is by right through the fence.  Just watch and listen as Charles Castorina describes the neighborhood kids destroying his fence.  He's been hit nine times.  It's costing him time and money.  It takes about half a day to just put up one panel. 
[02:13:00]  You know, it looks easy, but it's not.  I would say between $2,000 and $3,000 to replace it.  How great is that?  Is it gold plated?  It's a fence section.  Yeah.  They're just stupid.  They keep putting up another weak fence that these kids can just plow through.  Yeah.  That's true.  They're going to put like spikes or metal slats so the kid paralyzes himself.  Yeah, something.  And then sues.  Yeah.  A kiddie pool filled with acid on the other side.  There are so many fun things. 
[02:13:30]  Go watch a Roadrunner cartoon.  You'll get some ideas for what should be on the other side of the fence.  You dangle those triple hook fish hooks by fishing lines from the top of the fence down, and  then when they bash through it, they just get hooked with the fish hooks.  Why wouldn't you do that?  And then videotape it.  Like, sit out, videotape it, and then as he's hung up in the hooks, you go up to him  and just go, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, as you videotape him. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, would that be a laugh?  We're running out of show.  We've got 45 seconds left.  They explain the whole fence plowing phenomenon here.  The concept is simple.  Run at a fence at full speed and throw your body through.  It's caused many sleepless nights, of course, fiance.  I was just going to bed, and it was like 12, 15, and I heard,  I said, oh, that's the fence, and I got up, and sure enough, that's the fence,  because you recognize the sound by now.  They invested in cameras, knowing it would happen again.  This time, they were caught on camera. 
[02:14:30]  The audio and video outside was being recorded right to the kitchen.  They have a message for this hard-headed teen who could be charged with criminal mischief.  If he turns himself in and pays for the damage, we will not prosecute.  Betty and Charles handed over their recorded video to the Nassau County Police,  but so far the cops say they have no suspects and they've made no arrests,  but they promise the investigation will continue.  All right, there you go.  We could have done a little more on that, but we're running out of show.  But there you go.  The video of the day is fence plowing. 
[02:15:00]  Throw that in a search, and you'll have at least an hour of fun watching some of these videos today.  In my day, we just used to see how many people we could fit in a phone booth.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my.  Crash doesn't work.  There you go.  Doesn't work at the end of the show.  All right.  Coming up next, JV and Elvis, and then my pal Nick DiPaolo, and then the radio chick.  But that's only in New York, so the rest of the country just died.  Why don't you just take a little walk with us next, Sam? 
[02:15:30]  Right.  That's where you'll find us for the next couple of hours.  Have a great day.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:16:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:16:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.

[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  We took a lazy stroll today.  Beautiful out there.  Oh, finally.  It's going to be 75 today, they're saying?  They changed it.  75 degrees.  Changed it to what?  What's that?  Jimmy's such a liar. 
[02:19:30]  He's just a liar.  I love that Jimmy's a liar.  No, they did change it.  They said it's going to be something.  Did they?  It's going to be something, all right.  Let's talk to the guy.  People are saying, I heard people talking.  Yeah, 70, 75.  All right, so fence plowing.  There you go.  That's what the kids are doing today.  Is that what we were yapping about?  Yeah, that's how we ended the other show, which is the same show for you people.  I was listening to the best of, there we go, coach off. 
[02:20:00]  I was listening to the best of when we were waiting to start the show.  Me and Dan were laughing.  It was the dolphin retard bit.  Oh, that's a great bit.  Yeah, where they used the dolphins to kind of help educate the retarded people, and all  me and you were doing was just making horrible retard dolphin jokes.  Oh, you're awful.  I don't remember that one.  It was hysterical.  You know, the 11 a.m. hour is becoming really good, too, because it's all that old stuff from 
[02:20:30]  many days.  What are we playing today?  Do we know?  That, too.  We should start promoting it, because it's really, really good.  I listen to some of that when I'm driving home, and yeah, I'm like, oh my God, I don't  fucking remember doing this.  I'm sitting there sometimes going, I wonder what's going to happen next, and we did the  bit, but these things haven't been heard in four or five years, some of them.  And then you're amazed that they were ever on regular radio.  Oh, absolutely.  God, what we were saying, just calling people twats.  All right, let's.  Stuck my junk in her ass. 
[02:21:00]  Shit like that was said.  All right, let's get right back into it.  Let's talk about girls licking guys' assholes.  All right, Jay, Wisconsin.  No beating around the bush over here.  What's up, Jay?  Yeah, I had a life-changing experience last night.  You had your ass eaten?  Yeah, the old lady was kind of eating my ass last night, and she kind of got a piece stuck  between her teeth, and she doesn't really have a gap in her teeth.  So I was bleeding pretty profusely, and it's not exactly something you go to the doctor with. 
[02:21:30]  Wait, wait, wait.  My brother's in Ian.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We got a yield sign here.  Slow down.  What's up?  What got stuck between her teeth that made you bleed?  I have no idea.  I don't see it.  Wait, who...  Wait, she got...  You were bleeding, but she had something stuck between her teeth.  Yeah.  Did she rip a hair out?  No, it was like the chunk of skin around the old cornhole, I think. 
[02:22:00]  Like a hemorrhoid or some type of anal fold?  Like a fold, I guess.  Like, you know how you got a pucker?  Like your asshole's a pucker?  So one of those little wrinkles got stuck in her teeth and made you bleed from your ass.  Wow.  Or she probably had like one of those sharp teeth or like a little jutting thing out of her teeth  or whatever and just ripped your asshole's skin.  Oh, and it was brutal. 
[02:22:30]  Like the skin of a grape.  Bryce, who's your wife, Steve Buscemi?  Why would you go to the doctor for that?  It couldn't have been bleeding that bad.  Oh, it was bleeding pretty brutal.  You would not believe how much blood is back there, man.  And what did you say to the doctor?  Because that's like coming in with the old trophy up your ass and saying, well, I was changing  a light bulb.  No, I didn't.  I didn't.  I wasn't brave enough to do that.  My brother's an EMT. 
[02:23:00]  And I called him.  And, you know, I'm, you know, really, really nervous about trying to explain how this happened.  And so I kind of told him that I caught a nail climbing over the cattle pens.  And, yeah, he didn't really buy that too much.  But after he, you know, I finally kind of fessed up to exactly what happened, the whole time  he was sitting there going, how do you get her to do that?  How do you get her to do that?  What do you think she's telling people as to why she's on her third bottle of hydrogen peroxide? 
[02:23:30]  I have no idea, man, but it was definitely life changing.  Hey, someone wants to go back to, well, it's Coke Logic.  He wants to go back to yesterday's show.  He's wondering if she had a shard from an anti-rape device in her teeth.  Ah.  Hey, where did the guy go?  He was done.  He was done.  He said, I'm done with his.  He was done.  Reading from Whackbag.  I think XM would have dumped out of that description.  Well, it would be CBS.  And that's not the one I wanted to read.  But it updated.  You dope.  It updated just as I was going to the other. 
[02:24:00]  Where the hell was it now?  It's something to do with Jimmy.  Oh, dog shit sniffer.  Oh.  From Woodside.  Of course.  Hey, Jimmy.  Did your chick end up in your dumpster last night?  No.  I know, but we were kind of talking around it this morning.  We couldn't ask too many questions.  So did you tell her you were going for the HEP test?  No.  No?  I may have to lie.  Oh, yeah.  Just in case it...  Yeah, I think I'm okay.  I'm almost positive I was tested in the last year or so or two years.  But sometimes I get the results over the phone and I don't get the HEP work. 
[02:24:30]  So, yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm okay.  Where else can you get HEP?  Here's what you get.  They said B is more sexual.  Yeah.  Um, C is more needle, which is what Tommy Lee and Pam had because he pricked her finger.  They did some blood thing.  Great.  And A is from fecal matter.  Yeah.  Oh, so...  God, I hope you have A.  Oh, I don't.  Fuck that, man.  That could be a...  That could be a...  Well, I'm just thinking for the first one.  What's the worst one?  B or C. 
[02:25:00]  B?  A is the treatable one, really.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, B and C are much more deadlier because they can fuck your liver up and stuff.  That's why he was asking me, did you have any hard...  Jimmy?  Yes.  Hard cuck?  You misread me.  Why?  I was just hoping you had A.  Oh, for the story?  Yeah.  No.  I don't want anything to happen to old Jimmy.  But it'd be pretty funny that you got to admit that you got Hep A.  Oh, that'd be awful.  Which is from fecal matter.  Well, that's...  Do you understand that's why she's worried?  Yeah.  And I don't know why... 
[02:25:30]  I think my feelings were hurt.  Like, I don't know what was wrong with me.  Like, why was I annoyed at her?  I don't know.  I don't know because she didn't do anything wrong.  She's healthy.  Yeah.  Hey, really fast, then we can continue with this.  I don't want the instant feedback to update before we get these gems in.  Axel from MySpace.  Did this guy get rimmed by Jewel?  Vinny, he got his ass eaten by a snoggle tooth.  And then someone else is suggesting that she might have bit down on an old hemorrhoid.  And the thing bursted. 
[02:26:00]  Wow, she just gets a mouthful.  Like a pregnant leech.  Oh, fuck.  Or a tick.  Or a gorge tick.  I want to thank Jimmy for the subject at hand because we have another guy that got his ass eaten last night.  Matt in Indiana.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, first, congrats, Matt.  By the way, someone else is acknowledging it's Howie from New York City.  Hoo-hoo.  Love pad data.  Ass eating.  Is that what it says?  People are driving with ass eating. 
[02:26:30]  And they spelled it right.  And blazoned on their dashboard.  I invented the ass eating, Robin.  Hoo-hoo.  Ah.  Anyway.  What happened?  Little Norton will like this one.  My wife surprised me one night on my birthday.  I came home, and one thing led to another, and two of her friends walked out of the closet.  And as my wife was eating my ass, the other one started sucking my balls, and the third one was sucking my dick all at once.  I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  I don't either.  Three lucky girls in one area? 
[02:27:00]  God's honest truth.  And all I could think of at the time was, oh, God, Norton's going to be proud of this one.  Well, here's the thing.  Is your name Guy Compton?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Wasn't that?  I don't know.  I just thought I had to share that with you guys.  I just, I don't know.  Then what happened?  They all yelled, I guess, and said, mm-mm, good to the last drop.  What an ass. 
[02:27:30]  All right.  I'll give them that one.  I used to date a girl.  I got spoiled.  I was dating a girl who I would, she was a really submissive, sexy girl.  She liked her hair pulled.  And I liked to put her on her back.  And she was into ass-eating.  And fucking, there's nothing better than you're going to straddle a girl's face.  And I mean, literally, to grab her hair and put it on her back, I'm getting a rod.  Jesus.  And put your ass on her mouth.  And again, I'm clean.  You got to be hygienic.  Hygiene's very important. 
[02:28:00]  As much as we joke about shit in the mouth, and oh, sure, it's fun at a party.  But I mean, when it really comes to having my fucking asshole swabbed, cleanliness is next to godliness.  Yeah.  Continue.  Continue, as I eat.  And as long as I don't have mushrooms, so I would put-  I got a mushroom, look.  Oh, God.  We'll enjoy it.  Have some pennies for a chaser.  But this girl, she was really sexy.  I'd put her on her back, and then put my ass on her mouth, and fucking just smother her.  And she loved it.  And then she would do the same to me. 
[02:28:30]  See, like I said before, I can't- I can't- you're saying, you know, hygiene and everything, and that's fine and well.  I don't care how well I clean out a toilet bowl, I'm not going to stick my face in it.  Oh, dude.  As far as that goes.  It rules.  No, no.  I'm never, you know, I'm always up for anything.  But I wouldn't want to subject a girl to that type of thing.  Well, my ass is not hairy, and it's clean.  I mean, you might- you're an Italian. 
[02:29:00]  You might have like a fucking- you might have a hairy- your ass is like fucking the big ragu from Laverne and Shelly.  The big ragu.  Every time you bend over, I hear rags to riches coming out of your jeans.  Yeah.  Hey.  Laverne and Shelly.  Shelly.  Jay from Missouri on the Instant Feedback.  Who knew that eating ass can give you hep?  Jimmy's girl is out Googling dangers of eating ass.  Yeah.  She's educated.  Hep A, it can.  And I learned that years ago from a gay guy I knew as a comedian and told me,  you can get hepatitis meeting ass. 
[02:29:30]  It was actually an offer.  You could get it.  You want it?  Yeah.  Mark, from the Bronx, picture your grandma naked on her back, legs pinned behind her head,  and old Jimmy's tongue up her ass.  Ugh.  No, no.  Her tongue up my ass.  I like to fucking- I like to- you gotta grab the hair, and you gotta put it on her back by her hair.  You have to guide her head and hold it.  You hold it-  Wait, where?  Like you're- like you're sitting on a toilet bowl?  Yeah, like you fucking straddle.  Hold on, Jimmy.  Like that.  Mm-hmm.  You hold the chin.  There's her body and her pussy. 
[02:30:00]  Uh-huh.  You fucking hold her jaw so she can't move, and you fucking just lower your ass on her  mouth, and she'll lick your ass, and then you can lean down and pinch both her nipples.  And the way you're squatting, it kind of opens up your ass.  Yeah, but again, I'm clean, so I don't care.  Wide open.  Right on her mouth.  She's licking my ass, and you pinch her nipples, and then you can lean over and do this to her  pussy.  You rub it, and then you do that, just-  Slap the pussy a little bit.  Just straight around.  Jimmy's up on the console demonstrating.  It's fantastic. 
[02:30:30]  That was a knee herder, that one.  Oh, my best.  Console's hard.  But after a sweaty day, don't open your ass like that, because it's going to reek.  Be clean.  Who are we looking at, Will?  Read Christine M. from Jersey, while I swallow.  Oh, I don't have instant feedback here.  Damn me.  Hold on.  I'll be swallowing.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  Uh, hey, Carl.  Hey, what's going on?  Yo, Ant, you said you don't eat her ass, or you don't let her eat your ass?  No, no, no.  I enjoy anything.  Girls, nice, clean girl, head to toe is fair game, as far as I'm concerned.  Okay, I was hoping that's what you meant.  Thank you for watching out both of them today.  I just don't, uh, I don't want to subject a girl to that kind of thing.  Was your ass clean, or does it stink?  No, it's fine. 
[02:31:30]  I mean, it's, it's probably amongst the cleanest 99% of the ass in this country, I would say.  Harry?  I, uh, you know something?  Not excessively.  No.  No.  Hey, guys, let's...  Let's...  Let's...  But not, uh, not, uh, little fucking third grader Jimmy Norton ass.  Let me see it.  Yeah, let's, let's take the ass challenge.  We will not be doing the ass challenge.  Why not?  Jimmy, Jimmy shows his all the time.  Who cares?  It's an ass.  Uh, I just...  I just...  Because Jimmy has the ass of a young boy.  Hold on.  I'm just gonna throw this out there. 
[02:32:00]  We got...  Oh, boy.  You throw.  We got about 15 guys on, uh, on, uh, on, uh, the payroll.  Who else wants to take the ass challenge?  Taking the ass challenge.  Something tells me that Travis is ass.  I don't know why I suspect.  Because he's fucking 10 and has a full beard that grows like...  It grows like a biker's every day.  I think he has ass hair that if he doesn't brush it aside, it's like shitting into a net.  I think he has to actually pull his ass hair. 
[02:32:30]  I think he has to pull it out and drape it over the seat onto the floor like Crystal Gale hair.  Travis has a fucking...  A man's asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he just gave the thumbs up.  Danny, too.  Uh, before we lose Christine from Jersey, uh, a guy asked me to lick his ass, uh, but I pretended not to hear him.  That's the problem.  He asked.  When I met my boyfriend, he loved doing it to me.  Then I got into it and just asked him to clean before I lick his. 
[02:33:00]  I can lick his for hours.  Girls just need to be up front and say, clean it first.  You know what's a good way to do it, too?  Like, so it's not as threatening for her.  When you're 69ing, if you're on the bottom and you pull her on top, a lot of times when you're licking her pussy up to her ass, like, her mouth.  Like, if a girl starts licking my balls, I'll actually push her.  Like, I'll fucking...  Oh, wow.  A little bit down.  You are demanding.  And she'll lick below my balls, but it's a safe area because they can kind of back out when they want to.  They're like a deer.  Like, when a fucking deer is, say, grabbing some oats that you left in the driveway. 
[02:33:30]  Whatever else you leave for deer, some pie.  Fucking, here, eat this shit, Dick.  Like, speaking of ass, I just got a communique from Mike from fmqb.com.  Oh.  Check out page four of the autopsy report.  Yeah, we forgot to mention this this morning as far as Anna Nicole Smith goes.  Uh-oh.  Why?  Uh, this was in the autopsy report.  You might have heard by now.  The anus is unremarkable.  That is actually in the autopsy report for Anna Nicole Smith. 
[02:34:00]  Because they gotta, like, they gotta take a look at everything.  They look at everything and talk about everything.  And they have to describe everything.  What about her vag?  And, yeah, that's what we want to know.  Does it say anything about her vagina?  What was in there?  What was in there?  Well, Dr. Bumpyhead said the anus is unremarkable.  Wow.  You know what was in there, Pussy?  They found a semen and a signed Mickey Mantle baseball.  Fucking whore.  All right.  And we don't want to lose, uh...  Just like Marilyn Monroe.  This is such a terrific, uh, topic.  Let's go to Will the Trucker. 
[02:34:30]  Will?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  What's up, Will?  Uh, not much.  I was just gonna let y'all know.  Me and my wife, uh, we got the kids swimming pool in the backyard.  Rectangular shape.  And, uh, at night, you know, during some time, we'll jump in the pool, and, uh, I'll munch  on her while she's kind of straddling over the wall of the pool, and then, uh, I'll, we'll  freaking, she'll reciprocate.  In your kid's pool? 
[02:35:00]  Well, it's everybody's swimming pool.  Dude, I used to get fucking, here's the thing.  You'll be over the edge while she's licking her ass?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Leaning over the wall inside, leaning out.  Fucking, one of the sexiest things I ever had happen to me, I used to get massaged from  this girl, and she had, like, a mouthful of spit, man.  She had a really fucking, she was sexy, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, dude, she was, she had good breath, she was sexy.  Really?  I like spit?  It's like kissing.  When you're kissing, that's all you're doing, man.  I, no, this, that's gross.  Don't suck boogers up. 
[02:35:30]  No.  But just a regular mouthful of spit with no booger sucking.  Right.  That's crucial.  Only saliva.  You can drip it right in my mouth, man.  If it's, if it, because that's a kiss, you're swabbing spit.  Yeah, it's different, though.  Once it hits the air, it becomes something else.  It doesn't hit the air.  It's fucking, whatever.  But I, I would fucking, this girl, because she would lean in and spit in my mouth, and  when she was massaging me, she went, oh, come on, get up, baby.  And I'd get up, and my ass was wide open, and she was fucking behind me.  She was licking my ass, and she would open it and spit in my asshole. 
[02:36:00]  And then she would fucking, the thing she would do with your dick, like, I'm on my hands  and knees, listen to me.  I'm on my, hands and knees, my fucking face in the pillow.  I know what you're about to describe.  Do you, what?  You told us once.  Well, this girl.  She pulls it backwards.  Yeah.  Backwards.  But she would fucking, before she'd pull it backwards, she would, she would take her  fingers, and my cock is dangly, and she would tickle like, she would just brush the head  like, like little, little brushing moments, like you would an egg, like a, like a Faberge 
[02:36:30]  egg.  Right.  And, uh, and then she would say fucking filthy things, like when she tugged my dick back,  like she would say, like, call it a fuck stick, and a meat pole.  Oh, she fucking sexy, man.  And she'd spit in your asshole.  What is she supposed to do?  And that was a huge turn on?  Dude, I can't tell you the loads I shot with this silly goose.  There's not many things that bother me, but the spit thing is...  In the asshole, though?  Someone with the spit in your asshole?  Ugh.  Just spit in general.  Really?  Not your thing?  Okay. 
[02:37:00]  No, the non-sexual just spitting is like, ugh.  Oh, yeah.  Again, I don't suck up boogers and spit.  That's nasty.  You'd be surprised how many girls want their mouth spit in.  Jimmy, can I get through this before you continue?  It does look like coagulated saliva.  Ugh.  Big loogie.  Big lunger.  That looks like the saliva that would collect in someone's cancer bag if they had their jaw removed.  Awful me from Baton Rouge.  Message from Elo.  Ass-eating is alive and well on XM202. 
[02:37:30]  Elo's an ass-eater.  He has to be.  That's why he has the ties to wipe his mouth when he's gone.  He fucking eats ass in every city in this country.  There's no doubt in our minds that Elo's into some stuff.  He's a fucking asshole.  He's into something.  He puts it on his resume.  All right.  Kitty Poole.  Are we done with Kitty Poole, ass-eating dude?  Yeah.  Kitty Poole, ass-eating dude.  You all right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're done with him.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Watch out.  By the way, we haven't forgotten about Dice. 
[02:38:00]  I guess they're really beating up his MySpace page pretty nicely these days.  Yeah, I say that because instant feedback just came in from the wrong kind.  Frunkus from Paul R. Nelson's Wisconsin.  He writes, pest opportunity alert, pest opportunity alert.  Dice is going to be on the Tom Green video show.  Wednesday night at 8 p.m. Pacific time.  I think they already taped that, by the way.  Yeah, Dice is just setting the world on fire.  He's doing internet TV shows at this point.  Online, huh? 
[02:38:30]  It might be too late.  It might have been taped already.  Good luck.  CokeLogic asks,  How do you jerk off if you don't spit in your hand?  Ew, I never spit in my hand.  No, I don't need the lube for that.  What are you, Rikers?  You ever smell dried saliva?  It fucking stinks.  You don't need anything.  You're controlling your own movement.  You can get it just right.  You know what I mean?  You're not grasping too hard or anything.  You're just...  I prefer tension, speed.  I prefer lube. 
[02:39:00]  Gription.  Fucking Eros.  I think you'd always prefer a little lube.  But in a pinch.  You know.  Do you spit?  No, I would never spit.  Wait, wait, wait.  Yuck.  Did little Jimmy mess up?  It's very rare when he does.  It's impossible.  Matt the Trucker, what's up?  What's that?  Hey, where's the little meatball?  Right here, buddy.  Uh, let's see, um, let's see, Marilyn Monroe was married to Joe DiMaggio.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That was not, that was not a, that was not a baseball error. 
[02:39:30]  That wasn't about Mickey Mantle.  Mickey Mantle was a purposeful reference.  I didn't mix him up with DiMaggio.  I only said just like Marilyn Monroe in the way people look at her.  That was a coincidental tie-in with baseball, not, not...  Okay, my mistake.  That's all right, my friend.  And a big one.  I was just saying that Marilyn Monroe is an actress.  She serenaded Kennedy.  She did all these things.  And this was just a chick who fucking showed her twat in a magazine and fucked an old guy.  Yeah.  And had an undeserved television show.  She was a train wreck, and that's why people liked her. 
[02:40:00]  She wasn't talented.  All right, they're saying that, uh, Anna Nicole's vagina was wrinkled.  Ah.  Unremarkable and wrinkled.  Normal and wrinkled.  Uh, Chris in Albany, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Big Daddy, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, uh, I got a, uh, a surprise attack ass-eating story.  I was having a threesome that, uh, me and a buddy hooked up online with this girl.  And he's banging her, and she's pulling me.  Sorry.  I'm serious. 
[02:40:30]  And, sir, this is for real.  And all of a sudden, I feel this tongue on my ass, and it's her eating my ass out.  I remember, um, years ago, the girl who I actually fucked in the ass and got shit all over my dick and had to towel it off and throw the towel on the street.  And that same girl, she was a girl.  This is a way how you tell these things.  Will that be in your book?  No, I forgot about that one.  That is not it.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, the sequel. 
[02:41:00]  Hopefully, there won't be a second one.  Book two.  I have, like, ten stories I couldn't get in there just for space.  Um, this other, this girl I fingered one time.  You can throw them in the paperback.  Oh, you can make more, right?  Yeah, you can.  That's how you sell the paperback.  Oh, extra material.  Extra material.  All right, go ahead.  I was fingering her ass one time, different occasion, and I got all four fingers in there.  Not my thumb, but I was going back and forth and in and out, and she liked it.  And my fingers, I pulled out that blood on my fingers.  Holy shit.  The nail must have scraped a little bit of that fucking, that grape skin in the asshole. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, God, enough about the grape skin.  This is going to be the grossest show ever.  That is what asshole skin is like, fucking grape skin.  That's so tender.  Yeah, my fingers, I pulled them out.  It looked like a blood orange.  I was laughing during Chris's story because, uh, Elliot from Philly, it puts the lotion on  its hand.  It makes cumzies whenever it's told.  Cumzies. 
[02:42:00]  Cumzies.  All right.  Uh.  Uh, this guy has Hep C. He's been calling all morning.  David.  Good morning.  Can I ask you a question, David?  What's that?  How many times were you hung up on this morning?  And be honest.  Truthfully, uh, I got hung up on once, and then my phone went to shit, and, uh, the whole  damn thing cut itself off.  So, I had, I just called back.  The answer is three.  Three.  So, you have Hep C?  Yes, sir, I do.  How did you get it?  Uh, that's just it. 
[02:42:30]  I don't know.  They told me I had it for 20 years.  Wow.  I found out I had it a week before my 40th birthday of last year.  Wait, did you, uh, did it make you sick or what?  No.  It's just everyday normal life, but they, uh, I actually went to the doctor just to have  a checkup, and they, when they took blood, they called me back a week before my birthday  and told me I had Hepatitis C.  Um, and then when I started doing the regular weekly doctor thing, uh, the doc told me I  could have had it a minimum of 15 years, a maximum of 20 years, and I'm, uh, I'm taking 
[02:43:00]  49 pills a week, and I'm giving myself a shot, uh, every Friday night.  Of what?  Uh, uh, I can't pronounce the name of the pills, but the shot stuff is called Pegasus,  and it's working.  What it does is it just gets it down to where it's not even detectable.  Well, apparently it wasn't detectable for 20 years, so what do you need medicine for?  Maybe he'd have blood work done for 20 years.  I've had, uh, uh, uh, they say you can get it. 
[02:43:30]  The doctor told me two weeks ago, when I went up there to get a shot to prevent me from  getting A or B, uh, that you can get, uh, Hepatitis from eating oysters.  Really?  Yeah.  And wait a minute.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  You can get a shot for A and B?  Yeah, to prevent you from getting it if you've got one.  I gotta take three shots over a six-month period to prevent me from getting Hepatitis A or  B.  But you have to have one for those shots to prevent you from getting any of the two. 
[02:44:00]  You have to have those three shots to prevent you from getting A or B or vice versa, I believe.  But it's a brutal process.  I mean, they did a liver biopsy on me.  What they do is they knock you out and they take a needle about as long as your middle finger  and they run it in between your ribcage and take a sample of your liver to find out how  long you've had it and how long it is.  Fuck that.  Wow.  And the medicine that I'm taking, he told me it was expensive. 
[02:44:30]  I'm thinking five, six hundred bucks.  Well, before the doc, I mean the insurance and myself paid anything, $8,753.19 for three months.  Wow.  For three months?  The price of medicine is just completely out of control.  This country sucks.  We don't give a fuck about anything.  Well, you've got the dumb congressman going after violent video games and the word faggot  and the N-word and all this shit. 
[02:45:00]  Go after the real stuff.  Yeah, the scumbags.  Why are we spending hundreds and thousands of dollars on a dumb medication that we need  to take?  I've got to take it for six months and then I'm done.  Don't ask me what numbers mean, but they told me when I first got diagnosed that my numbers  were 768,000 and since I've been taking the medicine for the last month and a half, it's  come down to 11,000.  But when you first start taking the medicine, dude, I was calling my wife at work to tell  her to come home until my, I mean, it took over a month and a half for my body to adjust 
[02:45:30]  to this medicine.  My skin was so hot the very first time that I ever took it, my wife could set a penny on  me and the heat generating off my body would heat both sides of the penny.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  I mean, she could even put her hand on me and I had all the heaters off in the house.  I had the door open and my skin was still so hot.  You couldn't even hardly, and she just couldn't even touch me. 
[02:46:00]  I don't get this though.  You said you didn't even know you had it for 20 years.  Right.  Why couldn't you just go through life without taking any medicine if for 20 years your life  was fine?  You didn't know you had it?  It wasn't doing anything to you?  Well, it had scarring on my liver, but what my advantage was is that I don't drink.  I don't do drugs or nothing.  They said that was the biggest advantage that I had.  The hepatitis C, I believe it is, I don't know about A or B, but I know it can cause 
[02:46:30]  cirrhosis of the liver and other things and it just tears your liver up.  I mean, if you don't take the medicine, you'll be laying on a hospital bed waiting for a liver  transplant and you know how long that can take.  Wait, you can really get it from oysters?  I eat a lot of oysters, that's why I'm asking.  Oh boy.  I was as shocked as you were.  Dude, don't get Jimmy paranoid of something new, please.  Well, no, man.  I don't want to eat.  I won't eat oysters.  Let's get a doctor on the phone.  I was sitting in that office and he told me when he came in, when I took that, get that 
[02:47:00]  A or B shot two weeks ago, he says you can get hepatitis from eating oysters.  That's what you got to eat.  It's only if you eat the oysters, asshole, Jimmy.  I just fucking, Dr. Steve just gave me a heart attack.  My friend.  Oh, I asked him to get you.  Hold on, buddy.  Hold on one second.  Dr. Steve just sent me, because he's helped me out with this, he just sent me a thing.  You can get the vaccine now, Jimmy.  So I'm like, oh my God, that means I have something and I can get it for the other two.  And then he goes, no, no, no.  I'm just saying you can take the vaccine anytime. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  So fuck me.  I'll get the vaccine.  I wonder if I've ever, I might have even already had that and not know it.  I might have gotten the vaccine.  I asked him if he could get it from eating the raw oysters or the fried oysters.  He says he can get it from both, but mostly from eating raw oysters.  Okay.  And I'm from Louisiana, so I mean, I ate a lot of oysters growing up, but raw and fried.  Holy shit, it's coming in way too many times.  We got to, like, acknowledge this.  A lot of people are saying that you sound like the 9-11 guy, 9-11, yeah, the 9-11 call from yesterday. 
[02:48:00]  She entitled me, my entire life.  Well, have to see.  Yesterday I was in North Carolina at my house, so.  She did.  Ed, all right.  Thank you, David.  David.  All right.  Thank you, David.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  Let's say hi to Dave in New Rochelle.  Dave, what's up?  Dave?  Hey, Dave.  What's up, Dave?  How's it up for me?  Hey, I got to thank Oak for saving my relationship last December. 
[02:48:30]  How did I do that?  It was a throwaway bit, I guess.  You were talking about how your girlfriend needs a little skank in her.  And my girlfriend and I were listening.  And since we went on vacation, and next thing I know, I'm getting a little tickled down there  with her tongue.  And I kept going from there, and now she just, she loves it.  I'm eating her ass.  She's eating mine, and she said every night, she's like, eh, you know, someone told me  I had a little skank into my life.  I think girls need to be told that it's okay to just throw a little skank into the relationship. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, a relationship, yeah, yeah.  You hear from so many guys that are in these relationships, and it's like, you know, they  pencil in the sex, and it's one position, and it's like, all right.  Because the women feel like if they were a little skanky there, they'll be considered  whores or something.  You need just a little skank in your relationship.  I mean.  Just to get a little freak ass.  Skank it up.  That's how you know you're in love.  Like, after sex and stuff, my girlfriend and I will do something kind of, I wouldn't even  say dirty, really.  She's mostly regular fucking.  I mean, you know, she's just, she's good and bad. 
[02:49:30]  I mean, I'm sorry.  She's fucking, she's a good lay.  I'm sorry.  But, and then it's nice to lay with her after.  It's like, we don't have any problem making that transition because we get along really  well.  And, you know, it helps, man.  Like, if you're done fucking and you just want to boot somebody without looking at them,  you're in a bad relationship.  Hey, Dave, what are you up to in your relationship?  It's getting better.  A little bit more, more play in areas.  I've never been there before.  But she likes it.  She said she was, she tried to do it before. 
[02:50:00]  And it keeps going.  So, thanks a lot, man.  It was up and down before, but it's getting better now.  Yeah, we're just like Dr. Phil over here.  So, yeah.  All right, Dave.  Dr. Phil up the asshole.  We're encouraging everyone to have their ass eaten today.  Eat ass.  Not going to hear that on Dr. Phil now, are you?  Stupid Dr. Phil.  Dr. Phil's a douche.  Oh, God.  You keep talking about that dumb romance.  We say get your ass eaten. 
[02:50:30]  Get your ass eaten or eat some ass.  All right.  Can we take a break and get into some other things?  We might have to do a little cleanup today.  Every once in a while, we get stuff piling up and we weren't brave enough to do it.  Stuff we weren't going to get to at any point.  Crank call by 13-year-old girls, trigger, stroke, and victim.  That could be interesting.  All right.  Old people playing the Wii.  That could be interesting.  Oh, that's interesting.  All right.  Man, big Wii player.  Two friends killed that same spot at separate times. 
[02:51:00]  That's a little creepy.  That's unlucky lottery.  Yeah.  So, we've got some things to do today.  Oh, the English making fun of Americans.  This is a good bit.  We just never got to.  Fucking limeys.  We'll do a little cleanup today.  It's Opie and Anthony and old Jimmy Norton.  The Opie and Anthony program.  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  What is it?  XM 202. 
[02:51:30]  Hey, let's get right back into it.  We have Liz in North Carolina.  She's got a problem that she thinks we can help her with.  Liz, what's up?  Hi, I've been married to my husband for six years now, and we've got three kids, and I  have a child that I had before I met him.  Slut.  Yeah, especially since I'll be 28 in October.  Oh, four kids and you're 28.  Yeah.  Wow.  What do you take baths in, Lodes? 
[02:52:00]  I haven't figured out what causes it yet.  Come in your pussy.  You have to be freaky.  Hold on, why?  Hold on, dirty mouth just a second.  Yeah, that had to be blatant.  Well, she didn't understand.  Right.  All right, Liz, what's up?  No one told her.  I'm trying to get him to be freaky, and I can't figure out how.  What do you want?  He'll buy toys, and he'll occasionally use them. 
[02:52:30]  He bought me a set of handcuffs.  He's never used them.  We've got silk ties, silk rope ties, batten ties.  We can even buy nylon rope, and he still won't use any of it.  Did you get freaky before the four kids?  Yes.  Yeah, you've got to get rid of the lasagna belly, and then he probably would go back to  finding you attractive.  Oh, he does find me attractive.  That's not the problem.  Oh, lasagna belly.  Do you think he sees you as a mommy now and not a fuck toy? 
[02:53:00]  Uh, yeah.  Is he a submissive?  Sometimes, yes.  That's probably why he doesn't want to tie you up.  Has he ever given it to you in the poop shoot?  Oh, yes.  He loves it.  I don't know why.  I love getting in the old dumper.  But you like getting tied up, it sounds like.  I would love it.  I've never been tied up before, and I'd love to try it.  I've even tried getting another girl on the bed.  Wow, you're a good girl.  He's just a little more traditional, huh?  Yeah.  Is he a Christian?  He's a Baptist. 
[02:53:30]  A Baptist.  Is he a black man?  No.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  A lot of black Baptists out there.  What's your question?  How do you get him kinkier?  How do I get him to, I mean, occasionally he'll fight.  I want him to get a little rough, and he won't get a little rough.  Oh.  You want?  I mean, this is a perfect example.  We got in an argument the other day, and I got in his face just to get him to push me off, right?  That's unhealthy.  In a fight?  What were you, beating up on your stepfather?  What's the matter with you?  No, no, no.  He doesn't beat up on me.  I asked him, I got in his face, and I just wanted to see if he would put his hands on 
[02:54:00]  me to push me back, and he did.  He grabbed my arms, and he kind of pushed me back a little bit.  I want him to do something like that in the bed, you know?  Oh, wow.  She wants to be pinned down.  Yeah.  Yeah, she wants to be fucked.  You want, like, some kind of rape fantasy thing.  Not that far, but...  It gets the girls a little nervous when you say rape fantasy thing, so, you know, you  want to be, like, forced...  Taken.  You want to be taken.  There you go, Jimmy.  Yes, very much. 
[02:54:30]  And I don't know how to get him to do it.  I mean, I've actually blatantly asked him to do it, and he just won't do it.  Hey, um...  Hmm.  How fat are you?  I'm not very fat at all.  I've got a little bit of weight left from the baby.  He's, uh...  He's 16 months now, and I'm in the process of losing that weight.  How tall are you?  Five foot seven.  Five seven, so you go about a buck fifty-five?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not fat. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  And I've got...  I've got a set of, uh, 36 Ds.  Well, yeah, but they're a little saggy now, aren't they?  No.  A little stretch mark.  No.  But, sweetheart, you want him to kind of force you.  So, maybe he's just too submissive to do that.  So, there's no hope?  Do you smoke?  Yeah, I smoke.  He smokes, too.  Yeah, I could hear it in your voice.  You've got to put down the cigarettes.  They're going to kill you. 
[02:55:30]  We're trying to quit.  Both of us are.  All right.  What do you say to him to try to get him to be dominant, though?  Well, I ask him to spank me.  I've asked him to bite me.  I tell him to do it harder.  Stop with do it harder.  That's, like, emasculating shit.  That's telling a guy he's not fucking you, right?  Like, there's ways to do that, man.  Harder, harder.  You're like, all right.  Doing it as hard as I can.  Yeah, spanking and biting is cool, though.  Does he spank you?  Occasionally, he'll spank me. 
[02:56:00]  He doesn't do it right, though.  All right.  I know what's going on here.  You had an old boyfriend that did all this, huh?  No.  Uncle?  No.  Father?  No.  Brother?  No.  Schoolmaster.  So wait, when he doesn't spank you, right?  He probably does it.  He probably doesn't do it hard enough.  He probably hits the cheek.  What does he smack, like, in between the two cheeks at the same time, or he hits the leg?  He kind of taps me.  What's that?  He kind of just slightly taps.  Yeah, he doesn't know how to redden your bottom. 
[02:56:30]  I understand.  Redding from Whack Bag.  Maybe she needs to be tied down like Culver's Travels.  And then Dogshit Sniffer.  Wow.  Two in one day.  This chick should pretend to get kidnapped and go to Vegas and fulfill her fantasy like  all allies.  Well, all right.  So, hmm.  He's not spanking you, right?  Does he want to be spanked?  Does he want to be spanked?  He want to be...  No, he doesn't want to be spanked.  Wait, you're talking to him right there?  Can we talk to him for a second?  What the fuck?  Hang on just a second. 
[02:57:00]  What the fuck?  Oh, Tony Snow's got the cancer.  How are you?  White House spokesman Tony Snow.  He's got the cancer?  It said spread from his lower abdomen to his liver.  He's done.  Give him two weeks.  Hold on, buddy.  Spread from...  Wow.  Boy, that White House spokesman job.  Well, you know what?  That's a rough job when you're a White House spokesman when Bush is in there.  When you have cancer in your lower abdomen, you're done.  He knows too much.  Ah, you think that's it?  They gave it to him?  They showed him the secret room, and he couldn't keep it to himself. 
[02:57:30]  So now, you know, the government's got to kill him.  Got to go.  So what's your name, buddy?  Yeah.  Where are we?  Who are we talking about?  Oh, yeah, Liz.  What?  This is Jared.  Jared.  You got a live one there.  She wants to be spanked, and her hair pulled, and she wants to be pinned down.  And, uh, Bit, what's wrong with you?  It's just hard to keep up.  Are you intimidated?  Seriously?  Well, when we first got together, sex was really intense, and, you know, over the past 
[02:58:00]  few years, it's kind of slowed down a little bit, but, uh, yeah, it's just hard to keep  up.  It works all the time, and...  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Thought so.  Why don't you spank her and bite her?  That's easy.  You don't have to have a hard dick to do that.  I'm serious.  I'm not even joking, man.  Sex is something you should be...  You shouldn't be laughing at the sex here.  Yeah.  Stop giggling like a little school girl.  Dude, you can spank her really good.  If you're too tired to fuck, that's intimidating for a guy.  You can spank her.  You can discipline her. 
[02:58:30]  You can lean over and bite her back.  And while you're, like, biting her back or wherever she wants to be bit, and then you  kind of...  You reach down and you play with her clit.  I mean, then at least she can come.  Do you know what I'm saying?  It's like, if you're too tired to fuck, you don't have to feel pressure to fuck.  Just do that.  Well, I know what you're saying.  Myself, I've been trying to get more into it.  And actually, I'm a huge fan of you guys.  My wife, she usually isn't so much of a fan of you guys.  She knows what I'm saying.  Nothing to do with the sex part.  It's the kids, though.  I was really surprised she called you guys today. 
[02:59:00]  Hey, is she listening right now?  Yeah, I stepped out of the truck, so she cracked the radio up.  Wait, she turned up the radio?  Yeah.  Yeah, I stepped away, so it wouldn't get the backseat to the phone.  I want you to be honest.  What seems to be the problem with her body right now?  There's not a problem with her body.  Not much of a problem.  Where's the problem area?  Let's be honest with each other.  We like honesty on this show.  There's got to be a problem area.  Yeah, what's the problem area?  Well, after four kids, there's got to be a problem. 
[02:59:30]  The problem is more with how she feels about her body, not with how I feel.  Oh, that's good.  Very good.  How does she feel about her body?  Yeah, what is she?  What are her problem areas that she believes are the problem areas?  Well, she believes she needs to lose some more weight.  Uh-huh.  Myself, I'm fine with her weight.  Of course.  No, you're not.  But she...  That's not what you're saying to God.  No, no.  Of course he is.  All right.  Sorry.  She weighs probably about 40 pounds more now than she did when we first got together. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, that's not a problem.  40 pounds.  No, she's not real comfortable with that, but...  But you are, though, right?  You're comfortable with it, right?  Oh, yeah.  I'm fine with it.  Of course.  Why?  Sure.  Now, about the kids...  I don't want a fat in bed.  Now, there's probably maybe stretch marks or loose skin or something, right?  A little bit.  A little bit.  And maybe the breasts aren't as perky after...  No, breasts are perfect.  Breasts are perfect.  She breastfed four kids. 
[03:00:30]  Breasts are perfect.  And she breastfed four kids.  Why don't you want to spank her?  Is it the ripples that are happening, like, from the ass all the way up the back to the  skull and back down?  Is that bothering you?  No.  Why don't you spank her, man?  She's a good girl.  She wants to be spanked and bitten.  Why don't you fucking spank her and bite her, dude?  I love doing that to chicks.  It's fucking hot.  Punch her right in the face.  It's just something I need to get more into.  It's something I've never really been into.  It's fun.  Our listeners, we like to help each other out.  We feel like we're a community. 
[03:01:00]  Right.  A community.  A bunch of people want to know if her hole stinks.  Absolutely not.  Listener is helping a fellow listener.  You've got to love it.  Yeah, it's true.  Someone else wants to say this.  Dogshit Sniffer again.  Jesus.  Calm down there, Dogshit Sniffer.  Woodside.  Just admit it.  She's got balloon knot rot.  When she lays back, you open her legs.  Does it smell like Tupperware that you forgot potato salad was in? 
[03:01:30]  No.  And you say 40 pounds overweight.  You really mean 50 to 60 now, don't you?  Yeah.  No.  What does she weigh?  I guess 165, 170, something in that area.  Well, she said 155.  So, there goes another 15 pounds.  15 pounds.  She said 155.  Yeah.  Well, like I said, I said about 40 pounds.  She weighed 120 when we first met. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  120.  And does she have lasagna belly?  Lasagna belly?  Yeah.  What is a lasagna belly?  Lasagna belly occurs when a girl is pregnant with child and eats too much.  So, then the stomach gets stretched out to the point that it can't come back.  So, when they lose the baby weight, it leaves almost like Broadway curtains.  They're kind of hanging very decorative and flowing. 
[03:02:30]  That is terrible, Anthony.  It's true, though.  It's a real bitch for some women out there.  Well, like I said, she's working on us.  I think eventually she's going to be happy with that.  I think we have enough info.  I think you're the type of guy that just doesn't have it in them.  You probably want to be kind of submissive yourself.  You don't want to take charge.  I'll tell you one person that would take charge.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Guy Compton.  Guy Compton would take care of your woman. 
[03:03:00]  Guy Compton.  Guy Compton would fuck her mouth, pussy, and ass all at the same time.  While pinning her down.  That's right.  And hitting the kids.  Guy Compton is a man's man.  I don't know.  You seem kind of helpless, bro.  I don't know.  Yeah.  You got to dive in, I guess.  You got a live one that really wants to be pinned down and bit and her hair pulled a  little bit and spanked a little bit.  You know what you do, dude?  Trust me.  Do this.  Tie her to the bed, like bedpost, but tie her on her stomach. 
[03:03:30]  This way you can stand in front of the bed and you can make her suck your dick.  You can hit her with your dick a little bit.  And then you can fuck her from the back and then fuck her in the ass and spank her and  bite.  You can do all that stuff while she's tied.  So you can get everything you want to do.  And you like to fuck her in the ass.  So you can do that, too.  But just tie her on her stomach.  I would say to follow Jimmy's lead a little bit better.  But, dude, look, I'm nervous in bed, too.  We're all a mess.  I mean, we're all just trying to find our way like a bunch of dopes.  So you just kind of go with what feels comfortable, man. 
[03:04:00]  I like to bite my girl.  And I don't know how she feels about it.  She's gagged.  But, I mean, you know, she has a pile of charges.  You got a girl that wants me tied down, man.  Why don't you guys try a little something tonight, and then you call us back tomorrow.  Yeah, tie her down.  Get Liz back on the phone.  Bite her face.  Watch Cape Fear, and then do that.  Hold on to a second.  Please stop with the lasagna belly.  It's hitting way too close to home.  Hello.  Oh, no.  Liz.  Hi, Liz. 
[03:04:30]  Hey.  We learned something about you.  You don't weigh 155, Liz.  No, I don't.  That's all right.  You're 170.  Do you?  That's why we always tack on a little bit more than the girl says.  Yeah, you know how they talk about the freshman 15?  When you call the Opie and Anthony show, we know you women are going to lie by at least  10 to 15 pounds.  So we just tack that on right off the bat.  Did you lie, Liz, because you were afraid of being made fun of and stuff when you were  trying to get some answers?  No.  Okay.  She's a liar.  All right.  Sorry. 
[03:05:00]  No, that's not why I lied.  I don't like my weight.  Okay.  Yeah.  So what are we going to do with you?  I don't know.  What would you like this guy to do to you, your husband to do to you tonight?  Tonight?  I'd love him to just take a hold of me, you know?  Well, give us something specific, because then we're going to get him back on the line.  We're going to tell him to do this tonight.  And then you guys are going to call back tomorrow, and you better call even if he wimps out, and 
[03:05:30]  we'll get an update, okay?  All right.  Someone is suggesting that he ties you to the railroad tracks.  Does he have a big dick?  I like it.  Oh, boy.  That means he's kind of small.  I don't know.  I don't know what a big dick is.  Well, how big is his?  It's about seven inches long.  Yeah, that's really small.  That's a small one.  Maybe three inches round.  Yeah, that's tiny.  That's cool.  It's like a child's wand. 
[03:06:00]  They get a lot bigger than that.  So do you talk dirty to him and stuff?  Yes.  Okay, that's cool.  Honey, I can walk in front of him bare-ass naked in front of him while he's watching TV,  and he'll continue to watch TV.  Well, you've got to give him a better choice.  Yeah.  Really?  Let's be honest.  Don't do it when he's watching the Super Bowl.  Hot piece of ass walks by, you're watching the Super Bowl, you forgot about the Super  Bowl.  Oh, he doesn't watch football.  You know, he's watching Dukes of Hazzard, and you walk in the room naked.  That's going to be a tough choice right there. 
[03:06:30]  He might call your boss hot, and then stop.  Someone is saying, Adam from Columbus, not pinning your wife down is for queers.  See, it's not saying much about him that he's not looking when the TV is on, and you  walk past him naked.  You know.  Yeah.  It could be.  I'm not saying it isn't, but it could be that you're not attractive to him as you're 
[03:07:00]  walking by.  Yeah, you're better off with a little lingerie on.  Well, that I've got.  I used to be a dancer, so I've got all that.  Leave the completely naked for the young.  For the young.  For the young and childless.  Right.  Leave the completely naked for the young and the childless.  Jesus.  You need a little, you need some frills.  You need, you need a little dressing.  Shouldn't, you shouldn't honk your horn if you drive a shitty car. 
[03:07:30]  Well, what I would like him to do tonight, I would like him to.  You can't put whipped cream on a, on a pile of shit.  Oh, no, we don't do food.  He doesn't like doing food mistakes.  Oh, well.  Dumb analogy.  Now, what do you want him to do?  I want him to grab me, throw me down on the bed, and talk the shit out of me.  Way to be sexy.  And maybe like, how about this?  Let's negotiate here.  So tonight, you want him to, out of nowhere, grab you, throw you down on the bed, and have 
[03:08:00]  his way with you, maybe pinning, pinning your arms down?  Yeah.  All right.  Would you like your face slapped with his dick?  Oh, I'd love that.  All right.  And what else?  What about, uh, being called, uh, awful things?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't have a problem with that.  Like, uh, like a, uh, cunt, a slut, a whore.  What, what would you like?  Things like that.  Anything, anything but cunt.  I don't like cunt.  Okay, a slut or a whore.  Like, if you were sucking his dick, he said, yeah, suck it, Rosie. 
[03:08:30]  All right, anything but cunt, right?  Yeah, anything but cunt.  All right, let's get him back on the phone.  We're going to give you guys a homework assignment.  Okay, hang on a second.  All right.  I'm thrown down.  He's probably afraid of doing structural damage.  Hello, guys.  All right, sir, this is your homework assignment, and we're going to be checking in.  We told Liz to call us tomorrow.  Okay.  Out of nowhere, you get the kids in another room, get them to bed, do whatever you have  to, tie them up for a while, whatever it takes.  Oh, and then fuck them.  And then, and then you're going to get, you're going to like, uh, you know, grab your wife, 
[03:09:00]  you're going to pull her into your bedroom, and you're going to, you're going to force  yourself upon her.  Yeah, be forceful.  Like, grab her, throw her on the bed, and pin her down is what she wants.  And kind of, you know, take her clothes off rough.  Right.  And while you have her pinned down, you're going to take your dick, and you're going  to slap her in the face a few times.  Slap her in the face with your dick.  All right?  And then, and then here's the part, because she requested this.  Yeah.  Here's the part you got to do.  Right.  She wants you to talk dirty to her as you're doing it, and the number one request, you 
[03:09:30]  got to call her a cunt.  That's right.  As you're slapping her with your penis across the face, you want to say something like,  you like that, don't you, you cunt?  Yeah.  Okay?  All right.  I'll give you guys a call back tomorrow.  All right.  The one thing that we suggested that she actually liked, if you finger her backside, you have  to pull it out, and then you have to smell it and tell her what luncheon meat it reminds  you of.  Well, now Jimmy's joking.  Luncheon meat.  All right.  Are you guys going to call back tomorrow? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, we'll call you back tomorrow.  Olive loaf.  All right.  And that's what it will look like.  Fucking green thing on it.  Get Liz back on the phone.  The pimento.  All right.  Here she is.  All right.  Liz?  Thanks, Olive.  Hello?  All right, Liz.  We told him what to do, and I know it's going to get a little silly after the phone call,  but you tell him no.  You do what Opie and Anthony told you to do, and then I want you to call the show tomorrow,  okay?  I will.  I've got XM on the computer, so I'll listen to you guys on the computer. 
[03:10:30]  Okay.  No, but call us tomorrow, and let us know how it goes.  And if it doesn't go well, I'm sure there's one of our listeners in the area that will take  care of you, and make sure this zero knows that, okay?  All right.  All right.  I'm serious.  Call back tomorrow.  I will.  All right.  What time do you want me to call back tomorrow?  Five after nine.  Yeah.  That sounds good.  The quarter after nine.  Nine-twenty-two.  Yeah, nine-twenty-three, Jimmy.  Nine-twenty-three?  Yes.  On the nose.  All right.  I can do that. 
[03:11:00]  The kids will be at school at that time.  All right.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying that the husband might be, you know, gay?  Cheating?  Musical?  Happy for nothing?  All right.  Enough with her, but hopefully they'll call back tomorrow.  All right.  Here's the Wii story.  Wii Fever is sweeping every generation.  It seems Nintendo's new mission is to expand their video game market beyond its core, kids 
[03:11:30]  and young men, and that strategy is beginning to pay off.  Even seniors, a generation that missed the video game revolution entirely, are buying in,  while other game makers focused on cutting-edge graphics.  Nintendo focused on making games easier to play and more appealing to a mass market.  Kid, I just can't see my grandmother playing this game.  Anyway, the Wii outsold both the new X360 and the PlayStation 3 in January and February. 
[03:12:00]  Do they have, like, a Wii shuffleboard?  That could work, right?  Now, that my grandmother would play.  That would be a big hit in Boca.  It would.  You know, it's a popular Wii game with the all-women.  We swing around.  It's called Beat the Young Negro Off with Your Purse.  I like the Wii because it's got the hand controllers, and the old people have a great game.  You lay down in bed and try to push the pillow off of your face as the nursing home aide tries to suffocate you. 
[03:12:30]  It's called the Angel of Death game.  But damn, you get the high score every time.  By the way, did you hear the reporter say the X360?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Huh?  I was trying to sound informed about video games.  That would be the Xbox.  Oh, they, I tell you, they, um, they like it, the old people.  And she went with a shuffleboard joke because they work out with it.  It's good for them.  Dan's got the Wii.  But then again, if we were...  Dan's a big fan of the Wii. 
[03:13:00]  Then again, if we sat here and just read the news, you would understand the difference between us and them.  We suck at reading.  They suck at telling jokes.  Dan, what do you play on the Wii?  I, I, I, I, like, I know a lot of people like the, uh, the console gaming.  The Wii to me always seems a little, little, um, immature as far as console gaming goes.  Uh, understandable.  Yeah.  Um, well, I played a, I've been playing a snowboarding game. 
[03:13:30]  Snowboarding?  And is the snowboarder on there some big, round-headed, wacky, anime-looking character?  Enough with the big heads with the Wii games.  Enough.  Enough.  Fucking.  They look like fucking mongoloids.  Wait, we have Down Syndrome.  Uh, no, they're pretty normal-looking.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, but, uh, yesterday I picked up the Godfather game for the Wii.  Oh, for the Wii?  Yes.  Now, is this the regular, the Godfather game that's been out for, for a little while? 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, with a little bit of added content, but not.  Oh, a little extra added.  Now, how is that different?  I've, I've played that on my PC.  Great game.  I like it.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  It's, uh, it follows the storyline of the Godfather movies, but you're kind of a peripheral character  that's around the situations that happen in the movie, so it's kind of cool, you know,  you get to see the movie as it happens, the characters from the Godfather, but like, during  the Luca Brasi scene where he's getting strangled, uh, you're outside the window, like, looking 
[03:14:30]  into the, the bar where he's being strangled, and then you gotta kind of do things and get  away from people.  And the best part is when you get to be the, the parent who's actually carrying the grandson  Frank.  I want to be grandson Frank in the Godfather game.  What's wrong with the Wii?  Well, I want to know how that, uh, Wii uses, uh, do you use the hand controllers or is it  the regular?  Now, how do you do that?  You grab people and then punch them.  Oh, so you could grab someone with one of the controllers, because I know you got at one  point, uh, to start out especially, you got to go into some of the stores and boss the 
[03:15:00]  people around a little bit. You got to knock them around, but not too much, because then  they get like, uh, dead or they get too pissed off. So you got to try to get money out of  them. Usually they go, ah, get out of here. And then you got to grab them and smack them  around a little bit.  Yeah.  So you grab with one hand.  Yeah. And then punch with the other.  And you can punch with the other.  Yeah.  Like, big punching in the air.  Do you imagine in 10 to 15 years how, like, video games are going to seem so obsolete, like 
[03:15:30]  it's going to be all this interactive hologram type shit?  Well, I would hope so. Because, uh, you know, they said that 15 years ago and I'm still  using my mouse and keyboard.  Remember that the Wii is the future.  Well, the Wii is the future of faggots.  Remember back at N.E.W., and it never took off, unfortunately, but they gave us, was it  Sony? They gave us the glasses?  Oh, yeah.  I still have those.  I used to play video games in the pitch dark. I would lay on my couch. I know the game  that's going to make everyone laugh, but whatever. Tomb Raider. I would play Tomb Raider, but 
[03:16:00]  I'd be laying on my couch, and the whole game would be, well, you're wearing the glasses,  but it feels like it's on the ceiling.  Yeah.  It was the coolest thing, and it was like the first generation on those glasses.  Yeah, it was like the TV glasses, so you could put them on and see what appeared to  be, it was like the equivalent of a 60-inch screen 10 feet away.  It was amazing.  But it's like a 2-inch screen burning your retina's eye right against your eyeballs.  So it would be like, it would be the whole ceiling would be your video game, but for 
[03:16:30]  some reason it never took off. I thought it was the coolest thing.  The future.  Well, but now they got the ways where you punch people.  Yeah.  You gotta look silly playing these games. Do you ever step back and go, God, this looks  ridiculous.  I play alone.  I play alone. I've seen people play in the bowling. Done that when I've gone over to  friends' houses to play poker and stuff. There's someone in the, you know, people in the  other room, and they're bowling, and it's like, I went to the Nintendo store here in  Manhattan, and I was watching someone do the golf game. That looked kind of cool, because 
[03:17:00]  you're actually swinging.  You're swinging.  The controller like a club, obviously.  How accurate could it be?  It seemed pretty accurate.  Yeah.  Yeah. Well, the Nintendo main one is sort of accurate. It's for all ages, so it's pretty  simplified.  Of course it is.  But the Tiger Woods one is apparently like, you have to keep your wrist straight and stuff.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So when you put the controller in your asshole, is that like, I have nothing for that. 
[03:17:30]  I was just commenting on how you put it up your asshole.  You got, here's what you just did. Anthony just got so excited. You got so excited over  the setup.  That I had nothing to finish it with.  I forgot the punch.  I drove off a bridge.  He forgot his case.  I don't see it, do you?  Danny was just recommending in my ear that perhaps I could bring in my Wii one day and  we could watch the fun of me playing the Wii.  I would love to watch you play your Wii.  Let's go to Rodney in Queens. Rodney. 
[03:18:00]  Hey, guys. What's going on?  What's up, Rodney?  I play the Tiger Woods on the Wii, and it's pretty badass. He's right. If you do your wrist  one way or another, you'll slice it or hook it. You'll put the ball out of play in a hurry,  but it's a great game, man. You should try it.  Oh, yeah, I should, huh?  You're mildly retarded, I guess.  You're right on that.  I bet you, I bet you if you tried it, Ant, you would like it.  He'd like it. Yeah, he'd like it. 
[03:18:30]  You just don't want to do it in front of everyone. That's the problem.  No, I'm not a console gamer.  All right, I get it.  Especially when you've got to whip your arms around and fucking kick and I don't know what  else you're doing.  I mean, yeah.  I guess hitting the space bar is more manly than...  Well, well, perhaps...  Oh, are you going to take that?  Pressing the left mouse button is where the bad guys really do their thing.  Not quite hitting the space bar. 
[03:19:00]  There is an unlimited number of options with the computer gaming.  You have your nice flowing aiming of your mouse.  You have your keys for direction.  You're moving sideways.  You don't have to use eight different finger combinations to do one move.  It's one button.  That's it.  Oh, I've got to turn on my flashlight.  Can I get a friend over here to have me with eight more fingers so I can press the fucking  console controller? 
[03:19:30]  You get used to it.  All right.  No, you don't.  Let's go to...  With the Wii, there's so few buttons, you don't have to worry about that.  Of course.  Buttons.  Let's go to Scott and Iowa.  Tense in here.  Scott.  Easy, boys.  Going at each other.  Hey.  I was just going to say, picture your grandma playing the Wii naked.  Yuck.  Thank you.  Vinny in California.  Vinny!  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  I was going on vacation to go visit a buddy.  We were going to go play golf for a week, and he broke his leg right before I got there. 
[03:20:00]  So he decided to get a Wii to keep us entertained.  The thing is, it's not even accurate.  We had a little ADH, ADD kid or whatever you call him, and the kid is literally running out  of the house while he's bowling, and the ball's dropping and he's hitting strikes.  The kid was amazing.  He bowled like 250, and he never even pointed it at the screen.  It's not accurate.  Well, I mean, you don't have to completely mimic the movements necessarily. 
[03:20:30]  You can get away with much smaller movements.  I think it might be a fluke.  I'm telling you, I'm telling you, you really got to try it.  I'm telling you, don't even point at a screen.  Start your bowling and just run out of the house, and he'll drop the ball, and it'll be right  on the money.  How about this?  Picture your grandmother.  Picture your grandmother jerking you off with her liver spot hands, and that grandma smell,  and when you come, it bubbles over into her hand.  Then picture looking at her hand as she takes your load and wipes it across your own mouth 
[03:21:00]  and sculls you.  Oh, my God.  And the charm bracelet jingle under your chin as your own fucking bleachy load is wiped  in your mouth.  Hey, uh, there's a, all right, hold on.  Let's say hi to T-Bone.  T-Bone, what's up?  T-Bone.  T-Bone.  Hey, man.  T-Bone.  What's up?  All right, we've lost him.  Enough about the Wii.  I know we could go all day talking about the Wii.  Hot topic.  The Wii video gaming. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, that's a hot topic.  It certainly is.  You want to take a break, or you want to continue?  I say break.  Always a break.  This local tavern appears to be quite festive.  It's a friendly bunch in here.  Seems to be mustache night.  Perhaps I'll belly up to the old bar and request a libation.  Ramon, fetch me a bikini-tini and then push in my stool. 
[03:22:00]  I think it will go.  Not being low.  Hey, hey, hey, like me is stoned.  My area.  My area.  By the way, a lot of people have looked at that hot tub video by now.  Yes.  Yep.  What do you think?  I'm telling you, see?  Well, I went home.  See?  I went home and looked. 
[03:22:30]  And yesterday, we looked at it very closely, but no sound.  It's the video on break.com.  It's like the most viewed video on break.com.  It's like four million views.  Basically, a chick having explosive diarrhea in a hot tub.  In a hot tub.  Three other people in there with her.  They jump out horrified.  She's there embarrassed.  End of video.  Right away, I'm thinking, bravo, Sierra.  There's just too much going on.  You don't hold your gut when you have explosive diarrhea.  You just don't.  That's not what you're holding because you know you're about to lose it all. 
[03:23:00]  So you're not going, oh, not only am I going to have explosive diarrhea all over the place,  I got to hold my tummy because it's aching.  Yeah, well, that, but I don't even think that's the biggest part of what makes it fake.  He's wearing a sweater in the hot tub.  He's wearing a sweater.  The acting.  The guy that isn't sure if he should leave the hot tub or not, even though the water's  completely brown.  Hearing the sound made me think it's fake because the acting is really bad.  What was the acting?  Are you sure, again, are you sure it wasn't a commercial?  Oh, oh. 
[03:23:30]  Oh.  Like they're supposed to really be horrified and it just didn't come off sounding like that.  It sounded like bad acting of people being horrified.  And, yeah, the brown stuff, it's pouring out of her bathing suit.  Could be a tube.  She's wearing a sweater in a hot tub to cover something up the way it's tubed maybe.  There's a brown bag or something on the side of the hot tub that could have the shit stuff in it. 
[03:24:00]  It's just, there's too many things that make it look fake.  Okay.  We got a guy that did his own experiment on the line, John, in Massachusetts.  John.  Hey, guys.  Honor and a privilege to talk to you.  Thank you, sir.  Of course.  Okay.  Here's the deal.  By the way, that's how every phone call should start.  Yeah, absolutely.  I like it.  I got a hot tub due to a manufacturer's defect on the shell.  They were sending me a brand new one.  So I wanted to test your theory.  I went to Hooters, had a couple pitches of beer, some raw oysters, and about two dozen chicken wings. 
[03:24:30]  And squatted over my tub, turned the jets on, and took a dump in it.  And it took about five minutes for it to turn that brown soupy color.  I don't know what to say about this.  I don't need that.  I'm at a loss.  I'm at a loss.  First, I had to think about it.  I was actually thinking about, like, well, the dispersion of the diarrhea shouldn't take that long. 
[03:25:00]  And then I realized what he did.  You shit in your fucking hot tub?  You're just dumping logs in your hot tub.  That's not going to make a mess like this video.  You need explosive diarrhea where it comes out as brown water to begin with.  No, I had the butt muds.  You had the muds?  I had the butt muds.  Butt muds.  It was bad.  My point is they were taking it away anyway and giving me a brand new one.  So I just figured I'd try it, you know?  Way to show gratitude. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  You're leaving fucking some shit flicks.  And, yeah, well, hey, I don't care.  They're giving me a new one.  But it doesn't.  I'm telling you, that is as fake as you can get.  All right.  John from Massachusetts.  He conducted his own experiment.  He says fake.  Let's go to Andy in Jersey.  Andy.  Oh, come on, guys.  First of all, an honor and a pleasure to speak to you, gentlemen.  Thank you.  Well, thank you, Andy.  Thank you.  Enough with the hating with the radio show.  It's time to show some respect.  Absolutely.  A little brown nosing in the morning, a little brown in the water, you know?  My feeling is this. 
[03:26:00]  It appears to me the cloud in the water, totally computer generated.  It didn't look CGI to me.  It looks like a prop.  It looks like prop poop.  It almost looks like it happens so quickly, like it all of a sudden appears.  It doesn't kind of, like, creep into the water.  It's just all of a sudden, blam, it's there like a cloud.  Well, because there's so much of it pouring out of the back of her fucking swimsuit, and  the water is kind of moving around, I don't know, it just, it didn't look CGI. 
[03:26:30]  Hey, can we start a new bid on the radio show?  Huh?  Uh, dumps in public fountains this summer, coming to the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Dumps in public fountains.  I want to say some big 12 to 16 inch longs.  Oh, you've got to be big ones, though, yeah.  I don't want to hang out.  I like the way we were opening these calls, but I don't like the way the call is just  hanging up.  I don't like the way they're stealing our time and hanging up.  How about this?  At the end of a call?  After they do the call? 
[03:27:00]  Uh, gentlemen.  Thanks a million for the time.  Thanks a million.  Something like that.  All right.  Well, they're still trying to decide if it's fake.  Coke Logic, he has some info on this?  Coke Logic.  Hey, boys.  You're having a hell of a show today, by the way.  Oh, thank you very much.  The listeners end up having their own show through our show, and Coke Logic is having  a hell of a show today.  Honor and a privilege to talk to you, Coke Logic.  I love your show on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, yeah.  I share it with Redding and Dogshit Sniffer. 
[03:27:30]  There you go.  Yes.  And don't forget Steve S. from Bayshore.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Some of the regulars.  All right.  Go ahead, Coke Logic.  So, the guy that runs break.com, I can't remember if his name was Jeremy or not, but  when you guys had him on in an interview, he said that he had actually gotten that video  before it was released to the rest of the internet, that it was a fake, so he didn't  post it.  The next day, everyone else had it up.  He actually decided to post it on break.com simply because it was number one everywhere. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, okay.  That's huge.  He said the thing was fake.  You can pull the tape.  Hmm.  Okay.  All right.  It was a pleasure talking to you guys, and thanks a million.  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Logic.  All right.  And thank you.  All right.  Fuck off.  Here's the audio.  So, this is the audio of that video.  Listen to how bad this sounds.  Is this going to take long?  Is this going to take long?  Is this going to take long?  Is this going to take long?  Yeah!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Holy shit! 
[03:28:30]  Hey!  Oh, my God!  And they're like laughing, and his holy shit was so over the top.  It's awful.  It was really bad.  You wouldn't say it.  You would be like...  What would you say?  You'd be like, what the fuck?  Or...  Like, what did you do?  You wouldn't be like, holy shit!  I'd be horrified.  Like, what did you just do?  Are you shitting in the tub?  What the fudge?  Yeah.  What the fudge?  Hey, you. 
[03:29:00]  Ah!  The Jews run the banks!  Just came out.  I was horrified.  So I'm saying it was first labeled as, girl gets her period.  Period?  Jesus Christ.  I know.  Hemorrhaging.  Wait.  You know, we've got something else here, and then we'll move on to other things.  CP, we leave it with you.  What's up?  Hey, I was just going to say you can tell it's bad acting because I don't know what to do  with their hands.  Brunkus!  Brunkus, indeed.  Brunkus, too, sir, but not like you think. 
[03:29:30]  Well, people are liking the idea.  They want it called Fountain Floaters.  Fountain Floaters.  But it might be chilly, so only in the malls.  Only in little mall fountains.  Oh, the indoor mall fountains?  How about this?  No outdoor, no out-of-the-studio contests ever.  What's next?  That's how we're going to get fired?  Mall logs?  That's true.  Hey, we just threw it out there as a goof.  If someone wants to have explosive diarrhea in a fountain somewhere, we'll fly you and a friend.  Poor Rita's day.  They run their own lives. 
[03:30:00]  All right, let's move on.  Come on.  Jesus.  By the way, the crashed Ferrari.  They're shown on every show.  That was, who's Ferrari?  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Eddie Griffin, the comedian.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But was it his Ferrari?  Yeah.  No.  No.  It's some kind of celebrity race that's going on in Long Beach, was it?  In White One.  Yeah.  Not many, uh, not many African-American race car drivers.  No way to salvage that one. 
[03:30:30]  Been a few.  Yeah, Wendell Scott played by Pryor in Grease Lightning.  Ooh.  There you go.  Very good, Shane.  Good.  Um, you get a start.  So what happened?  Oh, he's actually writing it.  Uh, I guess he hit the wall and ruined a Ferrari.  How, did, is there comments from him, or was he embarrassed, or?  No, he just ran from the scene until the cops tackled him.  Yeah, it was to promote his upcoming film, Red Line.  Oh, was it?  Yes.  How did he hit the fucking wall?  His comment, according to CNN, was, undercover brother's good at karate and all the rest 
[03:31:00]  of that, but the brother can't drive.  So he wasn't even racing?  This was some kind of, he was practicing at a racetrack Monday.  Was he in balance?  God.  It doesn't say.  He wrecked a Ferrari.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  Brilliant promotion.  Yeah, we have, yeah.  Every news station is showing it.  Maybe he wanted to kill himself because he realized how many bad movies he's done recently.  Yeah, nothing.  We're all agreeing with you, actually. 
[03:31:30]  There's a couple bombs there.  Yes, it wasn't, it wasn't supposed to be funny.  It was just informative.  That was, that was a statement that was meant to be funny, but turned out to be really poignant  and kind of sad.  Kind of sad, yeah.  With that, we have this.  In the small Putnam County town of Allgood, a phone call to Beverly Dixon was anything but  good.  What?  Mrs. Dixon was in a funeral procession when she checked that voice message, and what she 
[03:32:00]  heard was much more than she could handle.  She was rushed to the hospital, suffering from a stroke.  And there is a toxic gas that will be followed through in 10 minutes.  It will kill you in half a minute.  So you decide, it's your day.  Do you want to live or die?  What?  She's doing okay.  She's still nervous.  But she's, she's going back to words.  Two 13-year-old girls from Winchester confessed to making the call in the early morning hours 
[03:32:30]  of March 3rd.  Beverly Dixon's husband says the girls carefully chose their words.  They were quite similar to the rated R movie Saw.  Allgood police chief says he hopes this will be a wake-up call to those who are thinking  about making harassing phone calls, prank or not.  So they made a prank call to an old lady, and she had a stroke?  Yeah, she got all freaked out. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, look at the fucking beating this guy is giving this old woman in the convenience  store.  Um, yeah.  Is it the same as we always think it is?  Like the other guy beating up the old lady?  I think so.  Here's the video.  What did he do?  Crushing.  He, he lost it and hit the wall.  What an idiot.  Oh my God, that's an expensive car.  Yeah, they said like.  1.5 million dollar rare Ferrari.  Yeah.  Oh, you idiot.  I don't think they were looking for 1.5 million dollars worth of, uh, advertisement for the 
[03:33:30]  movie.  Message.  Wait a minute.  Oh.  Was that?  But the brother can't drive.  Was, um, was that a, am I, I can make one matter, but was that like a, a black, uh,  assailant beating up an old white lady?  I don't know.  I, I, I don't, I don't know.  Yeah, they, they kind of got off of that real quick.  I don't know.  We'll have to see it again.  Not that it matters in the criminal thing, but it's just, I'd be interested to see if 
[03:34:00]  they report it once again without the racial angle.  Yeah, I see that kind of looked like it.  Danny knows what that, uh, prank call is all about.  Danny?  Uh, Danny.  We go to you.  The, it was two 13 year old girls and, uh, they left a message for this old lady saying  that they had, uh, they had kidnapped one of her friends and put him, uh, put them  in her house and they were going to, and they were going to release toxic gas that was,  that was going to kill her.  Oh, that's great.  I'll, uh, it was, it was almost word for word from the first Saw movie.  Oh, okay.  And, uh, and she, yeah, and apparently the, the, the old lady just, she freaked out to 
[03:34:30]  the point where she actually had a stroke.  Oh my God.  I laughed.  All right.  We're getting, uh, thank you, Danny.  We're getting, uh, close to the line of the day.  We, uh, something's going on today.  We have a new boss over at free FM, our old boss, Dan Mason's coming back to run the place.  Southern guy.  We, we used to call him back at the N.E.W. days.  And the guy that brought us back to regular radio, who's a huge supporter of the show,  Joel Hollander, got fired.  He's stepping down. 
[03:35:00]  I think he's tendering his resignation as they call it.  Or he quit.  Yeah.  He needs to see us immediately.  He wants to see us today.  Yeah.  Even though he doesn't have the job anymore.  So why would we even go over there and humor him with our presence?  Because he has been nothing but an angel to us.  Probably wants to give you a bill for a dinner we took you to.  No kidding.  You guys forgot to chip in.  Start the speculation, but we are heading over there in about 15 minutes for what we don't know.  Maybe, maybe he just fires us as a goof because he can't. 
[03:35:30]  Wouldn't that be something his last?  I think today is his last day officially.  I don't know.  The last thing he does is boot us out the door.  Uh, but before we get in line of the day, Don, and get out of here,  Frank, you've got to help us out from Elkins Park, PA.  New story from today.  Uh, Pullman, Washington.  We've got to find out if this is real.  A man was charged with theft and burglary after police said they found 93 pounds of what?  Of what?  Theft and burglary.  93 pounds of what? 
[03:36:00]  Turtle claws.  93 pounds of turtle claws.  No.  Wait, let me guess.  At his home.  At his home.  And they charged with theft and burglary.  93 pounds of what?  Headphone cords.  Of what?  93 pounds of what?  Biscuits.  Of what?  Anthony.  Six-year-old.  What do you think?  Depends of what country they're from.  Ethiopia, that could be a thousand people. 
[03:36:30]  93 pounds.  Of, um.  The exact number.  Of what?  I know what it is.  Theft and burglary.  We've got to find out if this story's true.  Yes, Jimmy.  Buttered pretzel nuggets.  Why would you butter them?  They're good that way.  They're very good.  Oh.  They stack easier.  All right.  You could stick them.  Do you want the answer?  No.  No.  93 pounds.  Of what?  Um.  That's my concern.  Beef.  Beef? 
[03:37:00]  Theft?  I take it by your response.  It's not beef.  Theft and burglary.  I know what it is.  Theft and burglary.  Doilies.  93 pounds of doilies.  It's a lot of doilies.  It certainly is.  Let's play five questions.  Okay.  Jimmy, you got the first one.  What was it?  Why didn't anyone ever take that tack?  I don't understand.  It's a brilliant way to play that game. 
[03:37:30]  You can get back to the drinking.  All right.  Enough of the dumb party games in living rooms.  Five questions.  Yeah.  Um.  93 pounds of something charged with theft and burglary.  Yeah.  Um.  Is it sold in soul food restaurants?  Ew.  I'm not going to acknowledge your question.  I thought it was 93 pounds of capers.  Of what?  Uh.  Is it?  See, Ant can't help himself.  Organic.  He likes to figure shit out. 
[03:38:00]  Um.  No.  Four questions to go.  Is it, uh.  And it's not 93 pounds of frozen cum, right?  Not frozen.  Is it legal or illegal?  Hmm.  Legal.  Oh.  Ah.  Three to go.  Okay.  Is it.  Rigid or pliable? 
[03:38:30]  Stiff or can you move it around?  Oh, thank you.  Um.  Uh.  I like playing the dumb role.  It's fun.  Hmm.  I was smart in school, though.  I really was.  Yeah.  Uh.  I would have to say no, Anthony.  No?  Tell me.  Oh.  I asked it in a question form.  Which is it?  So, it's a yes or no thing.  Is it, is it.  Oh, I see.  Is it pliable?  I'll say that.  You can move it around?  Yeah.  And it can be moved.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess. 
[03:39:00]  I know.  And I think I read this story.  Wow.  93 pounds of cancer wigs.  Um.  Is it edible?  Uh.  Oh.  Very good question.  Could lead to the answer.  I would say.  Sometimes.  Hmm.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  It's pliable.  Most of the time, no.  No. 
[03:39:30]  Shit.  I.  Yes.  Oh.  No.  I got it.  See, I knew that would give it away.  Yep.  That gave it away.  Good question.  Let me read the story and then let's see if you got the answer.  Oh.  Let me write it down.  Okay.  Hold on.  Give me a pen.  Give me a pen or I'll scream and fire everyone.  And then they'll just laugh at you because you don't have that power.  I know, but I'll scream at least.  What a dick. 
[03:40:00]  Here's my answer.  I have mine.  All right.  All right.  We have a news reporter saying this is a real story.  Did we find the story?  Yeah.  Oh, can you find it?  My answer.  Mine's on the back here.  All right.  Mine's on the back.  I will randomly see whose answer is who.  I can't say this.  No, Jimmy.  Not nigger toes.  Why make me say that?  You creeper. 
[03:40:30]  Fuck.  That's too good, man.  Oh.  Did I get it?  Yeah.  I was arrested.  What was it?  Burglary and theft.  Burglary and theft.  93 pounds of panties and bras.  Panties.  Oh, and bras?  Yeah.  I just thought it was panties.  No, that was good.  I didn't say it was two things, so that's very good.  Oh.  Anthony?  Yes.  What do I win?  Do I win a prize from the prize closet?  You win two.  Oh.  Two stars. 
[03:41:00]  Two stars.  Rule.  I got two stars.  You got one.  Can I have one of those DVDs?  Is this one of those DVDs?  Wow, look at this.  Hot.  Oh, shit.  All colors, all sizes, all shapes.  You know how they lay out the evidence like they do on drug raids?  Guns and drugs.  Yeah, they're just panties.  They're doing it with the panties, and it's just like, look at all.  This is all filled with panties.  God, that's awful.  They're just giving you a sample.  They got pink ones.  They got white ones.  They got little ones. 
[03:41:30]  They got big ones.  Are they black ones from stores, or are they from women?  Well, do we have the actual news story?  They're edible panties.  Here we go.  Oh.  They're saying nearly 100 pounds of women's underwear.  Pullman police arrested 24-year-old Garth Flattery on 12 charges of second-degree felony  burglary and one felony charge of first-degree theft after a search of Flattery's home and  vehicle reaped nearly 100 pounds of evidence in the form of women's underwear. 
[03:42:00]  What's illegal about that?  Unless they're stolen.  I've got to reach tell them.  An apartment complex employee saw a suspicious man in the laundry room.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  So, there are women that have worn these and stuff.  So, he's a sicko.  The employee had heard of various theft reports of women's underwear and recognized the man  as a possible suspect.  Pictures of seized evidence. 
[03:42:30]  Shortly afterwards, the employee received...  I didn't know if that wasn't part of the story.  Shortly afterwards, the employee received a complaint from a female resident at a nearby  apartment complex.  Why are they called apartments when they're...  Stating that her underwear has been stolen from her laundry.  Hmm.  How do you drive on up?  Police estimate as many as 1,500 pairs of panties have been collected, costing as much  as $2,200.  Police had received a dozen complaints from five apartment complexes. 
[03:43:00]  He was sniffing them, getting them while they're dirty, smelling the ass out of them.  Or convictions.  All right.  Different flavors.  There you go.  All right.  Why don't we do the line of the day and get the hell out of here?  Line of the day.  Go to our meeting.  This was a great story we didn't get to today.  Which one?  We found the first gay frat house.  Oh, let's talk about that tomorrow.  I thought of that, but I...  They have to be gay.  I'll give you the headline.  Masturbating trespasser booted from frat. 
[03:43:30]  So you're part of a fraternity.  You're in a frat house.  A lot of drinking, a lot of partying, a lot of fun happens in a frat house.  All of a sudden, someone comes in and is masturbating.  What do you...  Who the fuck farted?  I don't know.  Jimmy got scared.  Of course.  It's line of the day time.  I always get nervous.  What a dick.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  I know.  That Febreze is killing me. 
[03:44:00]  No.  Holy shit, dude.  It's really bad.  Oh, my God.  It's a woman.  Dude, and there's also...  Yeah, you just gave away the punchline.  Oh.  Sorry.  I thought we were...  Like we were setting the world on fire with this story.  I understand.  Well, no, no, no.  Only that's why I'm saying they've got to be gay.  There's a frat house.  A girl comes in.  She starts masturbating.  She trespasses, so she just walks in, sits down, and she's petting the poodle, as it's  been described back in the day, and they boot her out of the frat house. 
[03:44:30]  They called the cops.  What the fuck?  You're right.  What?  Fagarinos.  You know why?  I didn't mean to blow the punchline.  There is a story, which was in the paper today, about a gay and bisexual fraternity at NYU,  and that's what I thought you were doing.  It's for real.  It's like, it's, you know, for those students to feel...  I wonder their hazing is, it's like lick a girl's tit without throwing up.  No, probably pick up marshmallows with your asshole.  Yeah, drop them on a little model of the other fraternity. 
[03:45:00]  On the frat house of the straight, the straight frat.  Right.  All right, enough.  But, yeah, they called the cops.  She walked out of the front door wearing only a thigh-length black coat as a fraternity  member called the police.  When police arrived minutes later, the woman had already left.  This is a hazing.  So there has to be a sorority, and she did something, and this was her punishment, to  go into the frat house and masturbate, because she set it all up nice with the long black  coat and everything.  What? 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  But these faggots couldn't handle it and called the cops on her.  Maybe she was a pig.  Yeah, maybe they were afraid of getting rape charges thrown at them.  That's another thing, yeah.  Go, get her out of here.  And then, this line, fraternity members said they will throw out two couches in the living  room because of the incident.  Well, that is weird.  Obviously, she was very disturbed, Nye said.  It was not how a normal person would respond to people.  That is odd.  They're going to throw away the couch.  What? 
[03:46:00]  She must have been a slob.  You can't read like that on the radio.  You can't.  I'm getting scared.  People don't like when they go, no, don't get scared.  You're getting Jimmy scared.  Oh, my God.  Don't get Jimmy scared.  I'm getting scared.  The scariness is going to come out.  Don't be scared, Jimmy.  That's okay.  I was just to see if there was anything else to say.  Don't let them build up courage, because courage pushes out the scared.  Jimmy, can you?  And scared stinks like dead animal.  What was that guy's name again? 
[03:46:30]  Who, Guy?  Guy Compton.  Guy Compton.  Yeah, read this as Guy Compton.  All right.  Line of the day is brought to you by BodogFight.com.  Tune in to Eye on TV Tuesdays and Saturdays for episodes of Bodog Fights.  For all the mixed martial arts action you could want, Guy Compton says,  check out BodogFight.com, you shitbag. 
[03:47:00]  This is the runner-up line of the day.  She had some drug called immunoglobulins, globulins, I don't know, for longevity,  Demerol, potent pain relief, Dalmaine, another sleeping aid, and then, like Jimmy said, nicotine gum.  And the hot beef injections.  So, never afraid to crash myself.  That should have got something.  I wasn't listening. 
[03:47:30]  I was too busy reading.  That should have got something.  It was hacky.  Come on.  I don't think so.  It was a little hacky.  I just like it.  The nothingness after it.  I was too busy trying to concentrate so I could read good.  I could read good.  I was just commenting the other day on how I don't even mind bombing when I could look over and see the joy on Jimmy's face.  Yeah, of course.  It's a look that just is utter euphoria on Jimmy's face. 
[03:48:00]  Well, it's not often you swing and miss like that.  And it's like there's nothing that makes comedians laugh hard.  Yeah.  To me, it's just a funny thing.  Obviously, I've been there so many times.  There's a look that comes over your face.  It's this smile.  But there's also your eyes are saying, all right, you fucking bond.  And you're enjoying it so much that it makes me laugh my ass off.  Yeah, it's funny, man.  It really is.  It's such a thing that people are scared of.  It's such a...  No, it's so fucking funny. 
[03:48:30]  There is something funny about it, about when your friend fucking just goes through the fences and the ball dribbles behind home plate.  Listen.  Spin around and fall down.  Dude, watching fucking Voss Bomb on stage for 45 minutes in Connecticut when I was starting at it, it's one of my fondest memories.  He was trying to be an edgy, smoking guy.  And his...  He had maybe a one for 40 minutes.  Oof.  Maybe a one.  But that's a long time ago.  He's very funny now.  He's great, but it was, you know...  Hey, are people buying the tickets for the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, April 14th? 
[03:49:00]  I should find out and get a ticket count.  I don't know.  You got nine comedians.  I think the tickets are going very well.  It will sell out.  Oh, yeah.  But I think we still got a little work to do.  It's just, you know, there's expensive tickets.  And it's harder for people because it's in Vegas.  Because people are like, all right, well, do we go to Vegas?  You have to get a hotel room.  Two people.  It just...  In Vegas, it's actually a tough place.  People buy a week of in Vegas. 
[03:49:30]  And I think...  They're already there.  I think also we're doing a press conference by the pool.  And I'm hoping all the pests show up for the press conference.  I hope so, too.  Because then at the press conference, we're going to announce the rest of the dates and all your comedians.  It's going to be a very exciting summer.  We're doing, I think, ten dates this summer.  Jesus Christ.  None of them are in markets that we're not in, which is going to be fun.  Yeah, it's going to be a challenge.  We're doing New Mexico.  We're doing something in Katy, Texas.  We're in Albuquerque.  All info on opnante.com.  We are.  Yeah. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  And the regular radio stations, they're doing flyaways.  So these tickets are going to start selling because they're going to really start promoting, I think, next week or this week or whatever.  Hey, did we get taken off the air in Maine?  No.  In Maine?  We didn't lose any stations, did we?  I don't think so.  Okay.  I think we were being simulcast on two stations.  Yeah.  Like, overlapping.  We lost Columbus.  Did we?  Yeah, that's too bad because back in the day, we did pretty good there.  Why did we lose them?  They went hip-hop or gospel.  Oh, they did something weird.  And then rumor has it we're going to be live in Chicago. 
[03:50:30]  They're moving us around a little bit.  But that means we lose a prime time hour.  Okay.  As far as regular radio goes.  That's a rumor.  I probably shouldn't have said it.  It's a rumor.  Well.  But I figured I'd cover it up by saying it's a rumor.  It's a rumor.  I'm smart.  They want Chicago Interactive.  And when you lose something to a fucking format flip.  Yeah.  We got to get New Orleans back.  And Seattle.  I'm going to Seattle.  God damn it.  Are you?  I won't be ignored, Dan.  All right.  We got to do the line of day because we got to meet with our old boss that got fired. 
[03:51:00]  Tell him I said goodbye.  He was a nice fella.  I'm going to say Jimmy says good riddance.  No, no.  I liked him.  I liked him.  We'll help you.  We'll help you pack your box.  Here's your hat.  What's your hurry?  Bowdogfight.com.  Here's the line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  I think Guy Compton doesn't just stand there dressed at the supermarket with a girl and look 
[03:51:30]  at her and his eyes go all swirly like he's wearing x-ray specs.  And, you know, the girls just start, you know, falling on the floor and, you know, you  need to clean up an aisle, too.  It's a mess over here.  People are slipping.  Looks like someone spilled cod oil. 
[03:52:00]  Holy shit.  I got to learn of the day.  Awesome.  See you tomorrow.  But.  Steve.  S.O.S.  I need milk immediately.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Milk Diva.  Milk Diva.  World Tour.  World Tour.  Featuring all your favorite Milk Diva hits.  Live.  Live.  In concert.  My blood sugar level is dropping as I speak. 
[03:52:30]  Featuring the classic.  There's a deli downstairs.  There's a deli right downstairs.  Is there not?  Oh, the app gets milk from Dwayne Reed.  You could forget the number one smash hit.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk.  Plus special guest.  The Milk Diva.  I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  And for the first time in over a decade, you don't bring me milk anymore.  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around. 
[03:53:00]  So I'm like, I will pass out.  You sound like a madman.  I know I'm whining.  The Milk Diva.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie wants milk.  He only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing how desperate I am right now?  You get condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed. </pre>
