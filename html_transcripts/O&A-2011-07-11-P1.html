<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King's introduction, immediately followed by a scathing critique of local commercial spokesperson Patricia McCut's incessant name-dropping ("Patricia McCut") in various ads, particularly a hair removal commercial.  The hosts speculated graphically about the nature of her "unsightly hair."  This transitioned into Opie detailing his infuriating experience with the Midtown Tunnel closure, causing significant traffic delays. He then launched into a graphic description of a horrific maggot infestation in his garbage bags after a Fourth of July party.  He recounted, with considerable detail and accompanying laughter, hosing the maggots onto his lawn and even into his pool.  The hosts engaged in a comedic discussion of the life cycle of flies and maggots, lamenting Opieâ€™s failure to film the event.

The conversation shifted to Derek Jeter's 3,000th hit, featuring commentary on John Sterling's enthusiastic call contrasted with Susan Waldman's less-enthusiastic reaction.  They debated the fan's decision to return the ball to Jeter instead of seeking financial gain.  Opie recounted a fan encounter, and the hosts discussed the Orioles-Red Sox bench-clearing brawl and speculated about why a Red Sox player didn't approach Jeter after the milestone.  Further discussion of Jeter's achievement and Lou Gehrig's career followed, before concluding with a return to the maggot saga and brief mentions of future show plans.

The next segment began with the hosts discussing the attractiveness of a Fox Business weather girl, followed by criticism of excessive on-screen graphics on news channels, reducing the viewable area.  They then critiqued Rob Bartlett's "Gangsta Mickey" character and its costume. A scheduling conflict for one of the hosts concerning a sporting event was discussed, initially hampered by inaccurate on-screen information.

After a break, a vulgar and crude segment about the fictional character "BoboCop" ensued. This transitioned to a positive review of *Horrible Bosses*, praising Jennifer Aniston and Charlie Day's performances, followed by a critique of *Zookeeper* and a comparison to other Adam Sandler films.  A significant portion focused on a harsh review of the trailer for *Jack and Jill*, criticizing its humor and premise. The hosts lamented the disconnect between critical reception and box office success for Adam Sandler films, contrasting *Mall Cop* and *Observe and Report*. This led to a discussion about the state of modern comedy, the decline of edgy humor, and the high salaries of A-list actors.  A listener called about Tiger Woods' upcoming press conference.

The following excerpt featured a chaotic mix of vulgar topics and offensive language. The show opened with crude commentary on a female news anchor's appearance and skills, with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy Norton, engaging in vulgar banter, using the f-word frequently and making derogatory comments about various individuals and groups. A segment featured listener-submitted "F-U's." Guests Bob Kelly (present in-studio) and Brian Cranston (mentioned in a joke) along with Rob Schneider were mentioned.  The hosts played video footage from a recent party showing E-Rock and others singing karaoke (E-Rock singing Billy Joel's "Only the Good Die Young," Sam performing Rob Zombie), hampered by technical difficulties with Apple TV and cell phones.  Discussions about cell phone providers (Verizon vs. AT&T), physical appearances (with morbid humor), and personal anecdotes involving alcohol consumption and intoxicated behavior at the party filled the segment.  The show concluded with mentions of upcoming appearances by Bob Kelly, show promotion, an Adam Carolla car show ad, a pre-recorded segment with Sam Roberts interviewing Elton John, and further offensive comments and anecdotes about a Soundgarden concert.

The final segment began with a discussion of Johnny Cash's "Hurt" music video, focusing on the narrator's insensitive act of showing it to his crying sister at their uncle's wake.  A debate about the saddest song ever ensued, with suggestions ranging from "Hurt" to Anal Cunt.  They discussed other Johnny Cash videos and a caller suggested Warren Zevon's final song.  Then, Brian Cranston joined the show.  The conversation shifted to *Breaking Bad*, with Cranston discussing the show's creation, character development (Walter White's transformation), audience reactions, and success.  He recounted the single-take pizza-on-the-roof scene and discussed the show's dark themes and potential for redemption.  He also discussed his other roles in *Malcolm in the Middle*, *Seinfeld*, and the *Total Recall* reboot, sharing anecdotes from his early acting career.  The segment concluded with plugs for *Breaking Bad* and Cranston's upcoming projects, along with plugs for the hosts' own shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard, you know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to enjoy it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony Radio Show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  Patricia McCut.  Opie and Anthony Show, I listen every morning.  It's just so funny, it makes me laugh.  Patricia McCut.  Patricia McCut.  Shut up.  I hear that.  Your stupid hair removal. 
[00:01:00]  I hear that on the way in every day on the news.  How local is that?  I don't know. I guess it's pretty local.  You do what I do. On the way in, you listen to some news, make sure you're on top of what's going on in the world.  Yeah, you've got to know what's going on.  And locally, there's this spokesperson.  I figured it out. She used to just be a voiceover gal.  Right.  And then decide, fuck this voiceover crap.  I want to personalize it, and then maybe I can get a little money for endorsing this shit.  It's brilliant.  So now she does commercials and then throws her name in. 
[00:01:30]  For no reason. And it's so out of context.  I'm finally in because you used to bring this up months ago, and I'm like, what?  But now it finally hit me.  This Patricia McCut.  It's so annoying because now she's doing like hair removal things.  Yes.  And it's so funny. He was just like, and they yank my pussy hair.  Thank you, Anthony.  It was, but it was, uh...  Patricia McCut.  She's like, the lasers only reduce the hair.  Right.  This actually removes it and leaves skin so smooth.  Patricia McCut.  She doesn't even go, hi, I'm Patricia McCut. 
[00:02:00]  No, she just goes, Patricia McCut.  She's so pompous that she could just throw in Patricia McCut.  But she was talking about her unsightly hair.  Yes.  And all I'm thinking is like taint hair that's just kind of sprouting out like weeds.  Yeah, yeah.  And maybe the pussy hair that's going a little too far to the sides.  All over the sides.  And it's just a wreck.  Patricia McCut.  Patricia McCut.  Do we have that commercial?  Can we play it?  It's so...  I'm so fucking annoyed by that one.  It's so pompous.  But you should be good. 
[00:02:30]  To just throw your name in in the middle of something.  And then she's...  I like to do a read, you know.  Hey, Steven Singer Jewelers, you know.  It's great.  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com.  Anthony Cumia.  And go down there to the other corner of...  It's like, it doesn't make sense.  No.  We got to find the spot.  We probably should have told the boys beforehand we were going to go with this.  And then she's talking about other people that are having hair removed.  Yeah.  That she met at the hair removal joint.  Yeah.  It's done by people who love their job.  It's like, how do you know they love pulling rectum hair out of people? 
[00:03:00]  I think you're lying, Patricia.  Yeah, I would imagine they don't love that.  No, they probably hate their job.  I would imagine they wanted to be astronauts like anyone else when they were growing up.  And now they're pulling taint hair from middle-aged women trying to still look young.  Patricia McCut.  Patricia McCut.  Could you get that stray thick one?  Yuck.  Yuck.  Every fucking morning.  Every morning it's there.  Does she talk about anything else?  Or is that the big one she's doing now? 
[00:03:30]  That's the big one now.  But she talks about all kinds of things.  Cars and fucking toasters.  I've only heard the hair removal.  And all the time she jumps in with that Patricia McCut.  Unsightly hair.  And the way she says it, Patricia McCut.  Like you can hear her smiling as she says it.  But the beauty of, you're right, she's pompous.  Like, she says her name thinking, oh, Patricia McCut.  Well, of course it is.  No one knows who the fuck this broad is.  Now I gotta go get some ass hair removed because she said her name.  I guarantee no one knows who this broad is because our phones aren't even fucking ringing. 
[00:04:00]  I never heard of this woman.  That means no one even has a reference to this broad.  Never heard of her.  So why is she saying her name?  Oh, no.  But it is annoying.  But I can't not listen.  I'm driving in.  I'm just like, oh, good.  I gotta wait for the Patricia McCut.  Yeah.  So we're gonna find that spot.  It's on 1010 and they're playing it probably every hour.  She's the girl.  Just run 1010 wins and get a copy of that crap. 
[00:04:30]  Behind the One Minute Pitches, a radio legacy.  What do you mean?  That's what they did.  She's a legacy?  She's a legacy on her, I guess.  Whatever the fuck that is.  I only heard about her when you mentioned her a few months ago.  I know.  I don't know what she is.  Who is she?  Is she like a famous reporter who used to be?  She's just...  First, that does live reads.  She's a voiceover gal that decided, I'm just gonna throw my name in.  Yeah.  I'm gonna do live reads and I'm just gonna throw my name in the middle.  Put me to the gang.  Just for the fuck of it. 
[00:05:00]  Just for the fuck of it.  All right.  How was everyone's weekend?  Oh, wonderful.  Yeah.  What a great weekend.  I want to thank New York City.  This is the one thing I forgot to tell you about.  Me and Ann, we're talking about our weekends, whatever.  I want to thank New York City for deciding they really need to close one of the tubes  of the Midtown Tunnel.  Oh.  What the fuck?  What kind of construction do they need to do?  That's not very inconvenient, though, is it?  Unless water's pouring in from the roof, don't ever fucking close the tube. 
[00:05:30]  No reason to close it.  Stop it.  Let the tiles fall on cars.  Unlike Boston, our tiles are a lot smaller and they're not gonna do any damage.  Yeah, no giant metal plates falling on people.  Yeah, when they do that, people just lose their minds, too.  They can't figure out how to do anything when they're driving through there.  And if they are gonna do it, they should just shut down the highway.  Yeah.  They just assume people will deal with the two- to three-hour delay to get into New York City.  It's terrible.  Dude, you should have saw, I was driving out to Long Island on Saturday at three in the afternoon. 
[00:06:00]  That should be an easy ride, right?  Should be.  And it was relatively an easy ride.  I'm looking at the traffic coming back into the city.  Yeah.  I'm like, someone's gonna die.  Yeah.  I can't even explain how far the backup was.  You're just going still to the friggin' fairgrounds, yeah.  And you know, and this is where it makes it local, because you just know with your highways,  if you see cars backed up to this point, you know in your head, that's an hour. 
[00:06:30]  Okay, you keep going.  That's two hours.  And I got it close to three hours.  I'm like, I think that's a three-hour fucking delay just to get back into New York City.  How does the politicians and whoever the fuck is in charge think this is acceptable for people?  Yeah, that's fine.  That pay fucking taxes.  That's fine.  It was three in the afternoon.  Yeah.  Shouldn't you be doing that in the middle of the fucking night, possibly?  You'd think.  It's probably some union deal. 
[00:07:00]  I have no idea.  I can't imagine an emergency situation where they have to fix something immediately.  I don't know what it was, to be honest with you.  Because then I'm driving back in Saturday night.  I had to take the big, wide turn all the way to the Triborough, which is a fucking nightmare.  Yeah.  This is too local for people, I guess.  But then on Sunday, when I was coming back in, because I did a back and forth this weekend  to Long Island, Sunday, the tube was open, and I looked around like, it seems like there's  no problems here.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  So what the fuck?  Sometimes you got to.  What the fuck are they doing?  You got to hop on that Queensboro sometimes.  No, that was, because that's where everyone else was going.  So that was.  So when I'm talking about the Midtown Tunnel Backup, those were the people that chose that  this is the better route to just deal with the tunnel.  And a lot of other people were going to the bridge.  So that was a nightmare, too.  It was just a clusterfuck.  It's an island that has more businesses and industry and everything else than any other  place in the fucking world. 
[00:08:00]  And you have to take bridges or tunnels to get off or on it.  And it's a brilliant fucking dopey ass move.  And we're to the point in the New York City area, one fucking car breaks down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The whole system.  It jams up the whole fucking system.  And then we break down.  And then the stupid politicians, you know, they think this is acceptable.  Well, they don't.  Because it's too complicated, obviously, to fix the problem.  Dude, they've been working on that area.  Every time I drive, it makes me angry.  For 20 fucking years.  20 years.  20 years. 
[00:08:30]  They've been working on that LIE area.  They just can't fucking fix it.  They can't make it wide enough.  Make it 10 fucking lanes and just let everybody go.  Yeah.  I'd love that.  The old days, they would knock down neighborhoods to expand highways.  So why aren't they doing that now?  Fuck those people.  We need more lanes out to Long Island.  You know what's just fucking horrible about when you're coming from the city to Long Island  first coming into the Midtown Tunnel?  When you notice all those barriers that are up, just stopping, like, streets where you 
[00:09:00]  used to be able to get into the tunnel, now they've eliminated those.  Like, you look over to your left, and you'll see, like, orange cones that have been there  for 10 years.  And there's a perfectly good street and on-ramp to come in and merge with that.  Closed.  Hasn't been open in years.  I don't know why.  It was closed for concrete repair removal and pothole repair.  There was no potholes.  You drive that thing every day. 
[00:09:30]  You drive it way more than I.  Every ding-dong day.  I haven't seen one fucking pothole in there.  There's no potholes.  What the hell are they talking about?  And concrete removal?  What's that mean?  Yeah.  What happened?  Don't remove the concrete.  That keeps the water out.  Yeah.  Stop it.  Yeah, whatever, man.  But I realized over the weekend I'm quite the useless piece of shit when I'm at home.  And I've gotten to the point where I really, I don't do enough at home. 
[00:10:00]  And Anne, of course, is away, you know, and she takes care of my house, Keith the cop's  wife, right?  And she's away, and Keith has been busy on a detail.  And so I'm left to my own devices.  I had this big Fourth of July party, right?  And I had garbage bags all over the place, kind of in the backyard, but they weren't, they  were kind of put in one spot, but still in my yard.  I saw your tweet.  Oh, boy.  I won't give this away again.  Oh, boy. 
[00:10:30]  Was that real?  Oh, it was all too real.  Really?  I finally, it was just about a week later, and I'm looking around going, you know, I  got, I got to just put these, I know garbage people are coming today and shit, and I got  to get this by the curb.  So garbage bags were hanging around for about a week.  Yeah.  Okay.  I picked this fucking one bag up, and they had a big, giant black garbage bags.  Were they on the side of the house?  Yeah.  Okay.  Fucking maggots.  That numbered in the trillions, I believe, just started falling off and out of the bag. 
[00:11:00]  I just, I literally made this sound.  I was disgusted.  In the trillions?  I couldn't imagine how many there were.  How small are maggots?  I haven't seen one in a while, thank God.  They weren't.  We work with a bunch of them.  No shit.  No shit.  They weren't the big, juicy ones.  Fuck, now I'm in a bad mood.  Why'd you do that? 
[00:11:30]  Fifteen minutes on the clock, Sam.  They were about rice size.  It's going to be a quick fucking bad mood now.  Fifteen minutes.  Sorry.  A little bigger than rice size.  Did you take a photo?  No, I couldn't.  Why wouldn't you?  I couldn't.  Because I couldn't look at them.  So I'm bringing the bags out to the curb where I had to take two bags at a time, straight  armed out, like I was doing the iron cross on the rings, because I didn't want them anywhere  near my legs.  And I have to thank my trainer, Pat, for that. 
[00:12:00]  I was actually able to do it.  I was straight armed out with these giant bags of garbage, and maggots just falling off  of these things.  And I had to make like eight trips, because they were just a fuckload of bags.  And now I'm like, all right, I'll get the hose, and I'm hosing these motherfuckers  off, right?  Where are you hosing them to, though?  So I got just into like, off of any walkways and shit.  You should hose them right into your neighbor's yard.  Well, I was hosing them into the grass.  Yeah.  You know, I'm just like hosing, fuck it, and they're just flying. 
[00:12:30]  But aren't they going to die?  They're not going to die.  Where are they?  I don't know.  You need a bunch of flies.  Kills them.  Instead of just getting rid of them and having the garbage man take them away, they're now going  to be flies in your yard.  Well, no, I think they really need a dark, moist place.  I don't think you just wet them down, because it was hot, and the sun was shining down.  Once the sun hits a maggot, they are gone.  Were they on every bag?  No, they were not.  On and in every bag?  If there was a bag that was folded over, if there was a bag like the top was folded 
[00:13:00]  over, and not even in the bag, if you lifted that flap, there were thousands of them in  between every fold of the bag.  How do maggots form?  Fucking flies go and lay their dumb eggs, and the gestation period, I think, is six minutes,  and these fucking things are all over the place.  That's why we'll never defeat the fly.  No.  No.  The fly is king.  We'll never defeat those bastards. 
[00:13:30]  So I hose them all into the fucking grass and shit, and into the bushes and shit like  that, and then I figure, okay, everything's cool.  A few minutes later, they're all marching in one direction back onto the cement, like  they were going back to where the bags were.  They have radar?  I don't know.  They got some kind of maggot memory.  Why the fuck would you film this?  I was horrified.  You should have filmed this.  No, it was something that I was like, I can't fucking believe it's disgusting. 
[00:14:00]  I used horrible words that I shouldn't use to describe my house.  You should have called me.  Like certain people should be living there, aside from me.  I was yelling that.  You should have called me.  I would have made a short film over it.  Oh, it was terrible.  You should have fucking filmed it.  Maggot film.  Hey, they're calling it Disco Rice.  Thank you, Booger Couch.  Disco Rice.  I guess that's the nickname.  Guess what?  They move around?  Yeah, they move around.  They're dancing and shit.  Disco Rice.  It was so bad.  And then, so I got all the garbage out by the curb. 
[00:14:30]  And then I noticed, because I started spraying anything all over them.  Right.  Lysol.  I found some bug spray.  I'm spraying them.  Then they all died.  And now there's thousands of maggots laying dead on the cement, like part of the patio.  So why don't you take a picture of that?  Because I didn't want to disturb the birds that were now coming to pick up the fucking maggots.  Oh, good.  Now you're going to kill the birds.  I know, that's all I'm thinking.  It's like, I'm killing everything.  I'm a fucking disaster.  One man fucking killing machine. 
[00:15:00]  Birds are going to be falling from the sky.  Yeah.  And then scientists are going to have to come around your house wondering why all the birds  are dying.  So I was all happy, right?  Yeah.  I'm like, oh good, the birds are fucking cleaning up.  This is the circle of life.  Right.  And they would get down and grab like mouthfuls of these fucking maggots and then fly away  to their little tree.  And then I noticed they were dropping a few.  Right into the pool.  In my fucking pool!  I had maggot pool! 
[00:15:30]  So I had to get the vacuum out and everything.  It was what a horrifying maggot weekend.  That sucks, dude.  It sucked dealing with maggots.  So I finally got everything maggot-free.  And I had to sit down with a glass of wine to unwind.  Because, wow, it was horrifying.  Goddamn maggots have to be the most disgusting.  You know, you could get like in your pool, right?  You get a beetle in there or something like that. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Or fucking, you know, you see a mosquito floating on top or some shit.  You don't go, you don't get disgusted.  I don't believe it happened.  Why?  No pictures, no video.  No video.  No, in this day and age, if you don't have pictures or video, it didn't happen.  I was embarrassed.  I didn't want, I did not want my house with any photographic record of maggots.  So I took no video or pictures.  Why?  Is that the black man's bug?  It was just, it was just horrid. 
[00:16:30]  I was yelling awful things.  But, wow.  Horrible.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, not eating Chinese food for a while.  Well, yeah, it was very hard to, uh...  Why not Chinese food?  Well, the rice.  Oh, the rice.  You know, to get a big mouthful of rice after seeing so many maggots.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, I was, I was stunned at the sheer amount of maggots.  Just piles and piles of them.  Piles!  How do they do it? 
[00:17:00]  That's unbelievable.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find a fucking video that you guys would, it's just what we're talking about.  No, no, I don't want to see maggots coming out of a vagina.  Is it on a, uh, out of a vagina?  No, thank you.  No, I have seen them coming out of a dick hole.  Okay.  What the fuck?  I have seen that.  It's disgusting.  On video or real life?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, they fell on my chin.  That was a video.  A lot of people are very confused.  Dan's talking about maggots.  Oh, maggots, yes. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, oh, people see, see, that's different.  They're very confused.  No, no, there were maggots in my yard.  Maggots.  Although during the 4th of July party, Sam was there.  Hey.  Hey, stop being a maggot.  Yeah, you fucking maggot.  Uh, let's not use the M word.  That's right.  Ooh.  Yeah, it was, uh, it was harrowing.  A harrowing experience.  So I have my, um, I have my security camera up here, and I'm looking at my big pile of 
[00:18:00]  garbage in front of my house, just waiting for the garbage men to come, because I want  to see how they react when they open the bags.  So aren't the maggots, like, leaving the bag of garbage in the front yard?  I don't know.  They're probably still in there eating.  Then go home and get a video of this.  I want to see maggots.  They're up front here.  They're in front of the house.  You should have maggot cam.  That's wrong with you.  I should get maggot cam out by the front.  No, they'll, they'll be picking this up, uh, this morning. 
[00:18:30]  Dude, you should just leave a bag of garbage with a camera on it.  You want, I'm telling you, you know how many people would check that out?  You know how many people would check that out?  People said I should be like my girlfriend, Casey Anthony, and just put it in the trunk  of my car.  Let it stink for a while.  It did smell really fucking bad.  I mean, but that's something that would have been taken care of in, you know, an hour.  An hour with Keith and Ange there and stuff.  But me alone, I'm a disaster.  We've got a great idea coming in from Todd in Jersey. 
[00:19:00]  Todd, go ahead.  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, you need to have, uh, Sam do the, uh, bleep game with Sam, uh, with Anthony Duran.  Oh, wait a minute.  Can we do that?  Uh, either now or later or tomorrow.  Let's do that.  That, that would be pretty funny to hear.  That's if he's not too busy, uh, doing another radio show.  There you go.  All you have to really bleep is the M.  Hey, yeah.  All right, boys.  Have a good day.  We gave Sam a compliment earlier.  Oof.  Sam will do more radio shows today than Howard Stern will do in the month of August. 
[00:19:30]  And the month of July.  In one day?  In one day.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  That is amazing.  I think Howard's scheduled to do six radio shows for everybody in the month of July.  Wow.  And I think Sam will do three radio shows today alone.  Yeah.  So in two days, he'll do as many radio shows as he'll do for the whole month of July.  So, who's the smarter person?  I just want to, who's the smarter person there?  So congratulations, Sam.  Thank you.  Did you find the video that you made?  That might be it. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, I couldn't remember the, I can't look at that.  Yeah, I'm not going to see it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we're talking about maggots.  You want to see maggots?  I'm sure it has something to do with a pussy or an asshole or.  What's it eating?  A guy?  A tongue?  Is it a dead guy?  It's a foot.  I think that's it.  I'm not sure that's the video.  Is this guy alive?  I'm getting queasy.  Why?  I don't remember if this is the video.  I have to see it.  It is a foot, I think.  That's a big toe.  I was trying to look at the maggots on the man's toes.  No, that wasn't the one.  The one I was thinking of is like that. 
[00:20:30]  He's a homeless guy sleeping, and there's a bunch of maggots in his ankle and foot.  Can't you brush that shit off?  He was so.  I don't know.  And maggots, by the way, they're good.  Like, if you have a fucking wound, you should put maggots in it.  They eat out.  They don't eat fresh meat.  They eat the rotted shit.  They're actually good for you.  They only like rotted things, maggots.  Doctors use them once in a while to clean out a fucking wound.  Yeah.  I saw it on Gladiator. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, do they do that on Gladiator?  Yeah, he packed a bunch of maggots in his wound, and yeah.  It probably feels ticklish.  It probably feels like there's little feathers.  Do you think you go like, yee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee?  And look, and there's horrid maggots eating you?  You probably just go, I'm being eaten alive.  Yes, by maggots.  Did you make a video called Ants vs. Maggots?  Oh, Ants vs. Maggots.  Ants.  No, not me.  That's probably another insect.  Ah, who cares?  Yes.  I wanted to see Ants' video.  Yeah, I was horrified. 
[00:21:30]  By the way, I didn't bring in the back of my fucking receipt, but I wrote down a whole thing.  I met some fans at FH Riley's.  Oh.  I was going to give them the nice big plug, because they were really nice.  I told Ant earlier, this guy comes up to me.  He's like, hey, man, I'm a really big fan, and that's my black girlfriend.  I know Ant wouldn't approve, but...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  But I just want to let you know, I listen to the show every day, and yeah, I know Ant doesn't 
[00:22:00]  like black people, but...  Oh, my God, I would totally...  I'm really in love with her, and we've been going out for five months, and...  I would shake his hand and be very gracious to both of them.  I hope we had him thrown out of the restaurant.  It did say that it was the first time they went to FH, and they're going to become regulars,  and...  Ah, there you go.  All right, maybe I gulped a little bit.  People think I'm a crazy person outside of this house, my God.  I felt so bad, though.  The guy comes up to me, he's like, oh, huge fan, but I know Ant wouldn't approve, but do 
[00:22:30]  you want to meet my girlfriend and her family?  But I don't want to know their names, because I fucking forgot the receipt.  Oh.  I said I would give them a big plug today.  Thanks for checking out FH.  Go ahead and say it.  No, I can't.  No.  No, no, I can't.  Yeah.  Wow.  She was beautiful, too.  Did the waitress walk away afterwards going, thanks?  Thanks for nothing? 
[00:23:00]  Gee, thanks.  I told you before I knew that thing about black people and tipping, I was in a diner in  North Brunswick when I was probably 15 or 16.  Maybe I was 20.  I had whatever.  We had eaten something, and I remember there was a black table getting up, and I told you  that the older white waitress was furious, and she literally walked up and goes, you  forgot to tip.  Oh.  And the guy went, I'm getting change.  Oh.  And you knew he was really getting change.  Oh, that was bad.  That was a rough one. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, he must have been so pit.  Probably didn't leave the tip he would have.  Yeah.  Here's your fucking 50 cents, you bitch.  Oh, yeah.  And I didn't even realize that that was a thing.  She was probably worried that they were black and they were walking out.  I just thought, wow, that lady was dumb.  Yeah.  Are you guys excited about Derek Jeter being the action leader?  That was pretty cool.  Thank you, fans.  That was pretty cool.  It was done in true, exciting, movie-like form.  Yeah, he hits a homer.  Big home run.  He almost hit for the cycle, right? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, he needed a triple.  I don't think he pulled that one off.  Oh, the triple's the...  I think the triple's the hardest one to do as far as the cycle goes, don't you think?  Yeah.  He was...  What was he?  Five for five?  Yep.  He had a great day.  Hits his 3,000th on a giant fucking home run.  And very exciting.  The last guy to do that was Wade Boggs.  That's right.  Oh, yes.  A shanky for the Rays.  Wade Boggs.  The old Wade.  That was just a really exciting moment there.  Oh. 
[00:24:30]  We got the Sterling phone call?  Sterling.  The Sterling call.  And he was very cool about it.  Yeah.  He didn't yuck it up and goof it up.  No, he was good.  For the rest of the country, this John Sterling is a hack when it comes to home run calls.  He's actually a very good announcer, I think.  Yeah.  To a point, and then he has to go over the top and make it about himself.  So everyone was wondering if he was going to handle the Dirk Jeter 3,000 hit call properly.  Now, does this include... 
[00:25:00]  What's her name?  Susan Waldman?  Susan Waldman.  Yes, yes, yes.  So, by the way, I think has a secret thing for Posada.  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I included an extra track just because I personally love listening to her voice.  I don't even know if it's necessarily good.  Who doesn't love that voice?  All right, here's how it went down on...  What day now?  Saturday?  Friday?  Saturday, right?  Saturday, yes.  Afternoon.  So the count holds three and two. 
[00:25:30]  There's so much energy in this park.  Everyone's going to need a nap when he's done here.  You can just...  Oh, she sucks.  Everyone's going to need a nap here.  No, not everyone's going through chemo.  She's not going through chemo anymore, right?  I hope not.  I wish her nothing but the best.  Also, the count being full was great, too.  You know, that added to it.  Full count?  Yeah, full count.  Were you watching?  Yeah.  Yeah, I had to see that one.  You were watching?  Yeah, yeah.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 
[00:26:00]  It was fucking great.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  So the count holds three and two.  There's so much energy in this park.  Everyone's going to need a nap when he's done here.  Can you pause that, please?  Yeah.  What is she doing?  Everybody's going to need a nap.  A nap?  What is that?  You're in a man's world.  Shut up.  Stop.  Stop.  Maybe you and the broads take naps, but this is a man's fucking sport you're announcing.  How terrible is that?  It's so much energy. 
[00:26:30]  Everybody's going to need a nap.  A nap.  Fucking, she's terrible.  She really is.  And I like her.  I really like her because she loves the Yankees.  Maybe a nap because a bunch of the boys have had about $20, $10 beers.  Yeah, yeah.  But not because Derek Jeter might hit a milestone, you dope.  That's what he's done here.  You can just feel it.  And there's the chant, which you can hear in the background.  Derek Jeter.  Here comes the 3-2 from Price. 
[00:27:00]  Swung on and hit in the air.  The deep left.  The ball's high.  It is far.  It is gone.  And he's homered.  Derek Jeter homers to tie the game.  And there it is.  Hit number 3,000.  Derek Jeter has achieved another milestone in his Hall of Fame career.  15 playoff appearances.  12 All-Star games.  5 World Championships. 
[00:27:30]  And now, the first Yankee to amass 3,000 hits.  The captain, Derek Jeter.  And as he promised, Jorge Posada jumped over that railing.  It was the first one to reach Derek Jeter.  Posada.  A magnificent milestone for a magnificent Yankee.  Posada's jumping over the rail.  She always thinks she knows what's going on behind Posada's fucking eyes.  What's going on with Posada? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Jorge's spinning in his box.  Posada's a libertarian.  Stop thinking you know Posada.  She knows everything he's thinking.  Just like he said he was going to do.  She sounds like Ted Sheckler.  She really annoys me.  Maybe she really does know because she's banging Posada.  Come on.  Come on, Georgie.  Yeah, he fucked her leg off.  Because no one will believe it.  I'm going to jump that rail, bitch.  Oh, don't tell nobody.  Just like he promised. 
[00:28:30]  He promised he wasn't going to come in my way.  Fucking give it to Sterling, though.  Yeah, he did a great job.  He didn't make it by himself.  Bravo.  A-plus for John Sterling.  That was a good one.  What's his home run call when Jeter does hit one?  How Jeterian?  Oh, I didn't know that one.  I think Eric's got one in the system.  Oh, it's so bad.  God.  Thank God he didn't do that.  Yeah.  I wish I had told him not to do it on this one.  What?  I wonder if somebody told him just don't. 
[00:29:00]  Or maybe he's gotten the message that it stinks and they're replaying the fucking, the TV broadcast most of the time.  And nobody wants to hear that shit.  We have an extra Susan Waldman clip.  Oh, good.  She kind of, I give her a C-.  I hope she resigns next year.  Oh, of course.  Derek now waving to the crowd.  Actually, he's waving to his parents who are up in the box.  Johnny Damon is leading the chairs of the Rays. 
[00:29:30]  They're out of the dugout applauding.  Johnny wanted to come over.  He got halfway out and was talked to.  And so he's back there.  But he is leading the chairs.  Derek coming out, waving to the fans.  What a day.  Hey, I'm glad.  You know what?  I'm out of the box.  So Johnny Damon obviously played for the Yankees.  He's on the other side there.  And he wanted to walk over to Jeter.  He wanted to walk over, yeah.  What would be the problem with that? 
[00:30:00]  What would be the problem with that to show, look, you know, we played together.  There's a huge milestone for baseball in general.  Of course.  That would be a cool moment that a guy from the other side comes over to congratulate him.  What's the problem with that?  Who had the problem?  It's just something you just don't do.  You probably don't want anyone in a Rays uniform around all those Yankees while they're having this nice photo op, probably.  But it's fucking Damon.  I wonder if his teammates, he might have said, ah, let him, just see him after him.  No, well.  Who talked to him? 
[00:30:30]  That's what I'm saying.  Someone basically said, don't do that.  I don't know.  Talking to.  What would be the problem with that?  It wasn't like it's just a basic game and it's a walk-off home run or something to win the game.  This is a huge milestone for baseball.  It reminded me of Jim and his Lady Gaga picture.  What?  What happened?  When he was spoken to.  He was spoken to.  We'll see what happens.  You think you're going to go over there and shake Jeter's hand?  That's where sports blows it.  Right there.  There's a moment. 
[00:31:00]  He was really happy for Jeter.  They canned right to him after he hit the home run.  Whatever.  I mean, the game itself is a who gives a fuck game.  So why not let that happen?  So good for Jeter, I guess.  Yeah, you know.  And then we got audio of the kid.  He's not a kid.  He's 23 years old.  Who caught the Jeter ball?  Oh, yeah.  Why the fuck would you give that ball back?  I know the Yankees and Jeter gave him a good deal.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:31:30]  He earned the ball.  $250,000?  What?  Is that what they're saying?  They're saying he could have gotten upwards of $250,000.  So why is he?  I've heard $400,000.  So why the fuck is he being?  I'm going to say $6,000.  Okay.  Why is he being a good guy and giving the ball back?  Fuck that.  Because he's being a good guy.  And then the organization hooked him up.  The Yankees and baseball in general, you know, rapes the fans.  Here's your opportunity to get some money back.  Can you hand the ball back?  They gave him seats for the rest of the season.  Well, like I said, they kind of took care of him. 
[00:32:00]  But that's no skin off their back.  Through the playoffs.  Yeah, through the playoffs, he has a good one.  And they said it could be up to like $75,000 worth of seats if it goes through the playoffs.  Well, they're not selling those seats anyway.  I would imagine this guy isn't independently wealthy.  He's got over $100,000 in student loans.  And he gave the ball back?  What a dope.  He learned nothing in college.  I know, right?  He's a business major.  He's a Verizon phone rep.  He's a good man, then. 
[00:32:30]  God bless him.  See?  Honest to the core.  Honest people that work for that Verizon.  It's amazing.  I can make phone calls.  Here's your ball.  AT&T would have held it to their ear.  Maybe this will sound better than my phone.  Holy shit.  I mean, maybe if these guys weren't making just billions.  Can't even say millions at this point.  A few of these guys are pushing close to a billion.  He said he's 23.  He has plenty of time to make money.  Yeah.  What a dope.  And he said...  I'm not going with the feel-good angle here.  He goes, Jeter earned that ball, and he deserved it. 
[00:33:00]  All right, so pay for it.  He earned it already.  If Jeter had to pay $250,000, he would never fucking even feel that.  And then this guy could pay off his student loans.  That guy's now a great Yankee fan.  He's one of the guys.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Watch what happens to this guy next year.  Get in line, stupid.  I'll tell you one thing.  If he cut back on his food bill, perhaps he'd have some money.  I'd be get caught up in the moment guy, and then I'd regret it when I was done. 
[00:33:30]  Like, look, I shouldn't have handed you that.  Yeah, could I have that back?  Dirk Jeter's not suffering.  That's why you don't hand it back.  Yeah.  Sorry.  You just don't.  You know, somebody would buy that ball big time.  That'd be great if Jeter sold it.  Like, I don't fucking care about it.  I just want the money.  Well, Noah makes it really special, and I didn't know this until over the weekend.  He's the first guy to do it with all the...  Yankee.  That's what I'm saying.  No, no, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, ever.  All the great Yankees that played, and I did not know he was the first. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  And a lot of those Yankees had long fucking careers.  Yeah, they used to play for fucking years, yeah.  You know what's amazing is Pete Rose had, what's 4,200?  Yes.  Yeah.  Like, as good as Jeter is, as many hits as he's gotten, fucking Pete Rose has 1,200 more.  And that's why he should be in the Hall of Fame.  Who gives a fuck what he was doing?  Whatever.  This guy knew what he was doing on a baseball field.  God, was he good.  Well, the pitcher's always distracted by his Moe haircut.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Cough up some good ones for him.  Only throwing at 75 miles an hour, thinking this guy can't possibly hit with a haircut like that.  He's got to be red-batted.  Big medallion.  Red-batted.  4,200?  Is that what Pete Rose has...  He broke Ty Cobb's record, whatever it was.  Oh, yeah.  4,200.  Although Ty Cobb is much more impressive.  Right.  Because he had those fucking...  He should have seen his brother corn on the...  That's a good one.  No joke.  Like, tie in corn or tie a yellow ribbon. 
[00:35:00]  Who's in second place on the Yankees, as far as hits go?  Jeter's the all-time leader, obviously.  A posada!  I don't even think anyone's close.  Who would you guess?  Or did you...  I would guess...  They must have thrown the name around this weekend.  I would guess Lou Gehrig.  That's what I would say.  Because he had such a long...  And I would say Lou Gehrig had 3,000 hits.  Obviously, he did not.  But I would have assumed he did.  Huh.  Who's second place on the Yankees?  4,256 hits.  And he's not in the Hall of Fame. 
[00:35:30]  That's crazy.  That's a trance.  Well, you know.  With all the shit that has happened in baseball.  He was terrible.  Enough already.  And he was going for DiMaggio's record of 56 straight games.  But I think...  What did he get?  The 40?  40, uh...  In the 40s, right?  People speculating it was the Babe.  He set the National League record.  But, I don't know.  Was it Babe Ruth?  I would say Gehrig over Babe Ruth.  He probably played Babe Ruth.  Oh, no.  It has to be Babe Ruth.  The Babe?  Has to be.  More hits?  Has to be.  It's Gehrig.  Oh, that's right.  Gehrig.  Sorry.  Well, I guess it doesn't have to be.  It has to be.  What did Gehrig have? 
[00:36:00]  Lou Gehrig's district?  170.  170 hits.  Lou Gehrig had 170 hits.  He had 50,000.  A poor immune system.  I want to keep going.  27-21?  That's what he got.  Ah.  Before he started turning into a statue.  Fucking shit.  He'd have been fine, man.  Yep.  He would have made it.  Because he retired early, right?  He wasn't even like...  He had to, yeah.  Oh, I understand that.  Yeah.  He was only like 30...  I want to say...  35, I'm going to go. 
[00:36:30]  He had to be later, right?  Because he played not many straight games.  He had to be 30, 39, close to 40, no?  I don't think so.  DiMaggio had 300.  300?  3,000, I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  On Maryland's face.  See, because he used to punch her.  And now I Twittered that.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  I didn't read that.  I didn't.  That's brilliant.  Yes.  36.  Retired at 36.  He retired at 36?  So, and yet...  He was, what, a season and a half away from getting the 3,000, probably, right? 
[00:37:00]  How about?  Wow.  Probably, at that age, probably two.  Maybe two seasons.  Hey, but he was the luckiest man on earth.  That's true.  What are you going to do?  But he really was, or he wouldn't have had...  You know who was luckier?  The hot dog guy without Lou Gehrig's disease.  That lived...  That lived...  That lived to...  That lived to 85.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  I bet you there was at least one guy that said, I'm the luckiest man.  Face there.  No, you ain't, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  How much longer did he live after that?  Not very long.  A week.  A week? 
[00:37:30]  He died in the dugout.  He drove himself to the funeral home.  Died at 37, and he retired when?  36.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  He really played right up to the end, didn't he?  Yeah.  Oh, gee.  Not really.  No?  Well, I mean, yeah, technically.  But I mean...  He put his uniform on and showed up?  That fucking disease, though, one day, you know, you're totally fine, next day you feel  your finger getting a little fucking stiff, and a year later, you're dead.  Oh, no. 
[00:38:00]  I like hearing that.  You don't have Lou Gehrig's disease.  Oh, thank God.  It's not the one you have.  No!  You don't have Lou Gehrig.  Jesus.  I know someone that got us.  Oh, gee.  I wasn't that close to him, but I knew him.  It is a horrible fucking thing.  Like Barack Hudson disease.  I mean, make your jokes.  Make your jokes.  As well as William Holden disease.  Bill Holden.  Hello, Bill.  Fall into the old table disease.  Old table head.  Nice hat.  I'm the drunkest man on the face of the earth. 
[00:38:30]  On his face on the floor.  Marcos from Yonkers would have sold the ball for money because he's a jerk.  I don't think you're a jerk.  I mean, if these guys are making as much money as they are, and you have to pay a shitload  of money to go to these games, I don't see the problem at all.  At fuck at all.  They take advantage of their fans.  Why not take advantage of them when you're in that opportunity?  I don't know.  It doesn't come off as... 
[00:39:00]  Like, you come off looking like a douchebag.  It gives a fuck.  Regardless of all the money.  But your student loans are paid off.  I'm saying regardless of the money and everything.  Okay.  And the money that the players are making and the money you are making.  It just...  You come off looking like, you know, oh really?  The guy fucking has his whole career as a kid playing fucking Little League.  There's his moment.  He smashes a fucking home run for his 3,000th fucking hit.  And this asshole is taking it home? 
[00:39:30]  Alright, let me give you another angle on this.  Uh-huh.  Going with what you said.  And that's very accurate, right?  So shouldn't Derek Jeter now do the right thing and go, oh fuck, it's in the press.  You owe $100,000 in school loans and you took care of me and you were nice to me?  I'm going to secretly pay off your student loans.  Yeah.  Maybe he did secretly.  He fucking isn't going to do it.  I guarantee he's not going to do it.  No.  Why would he?  No.  And that's why this fucking fat fuck with the fucking bitch tits should have sold the ball.  And got rid of his student loans.  He's right in there. 
[00:40:00]  Sorry.  I didn't mean that.  Oh, wow.  We're really late for the first E-Rock jokes.  Sorry.  I know.  That's hilarious.  Let me say hi to Scott on Long Island City, actually.  Scott, go ahead.  Squat.  Hey, how you doing?  It's a Major League Baseball rule that the opposing players are not allowed to fraternize with one another.  That's why they probably didn't let Damon go over.  Alright, but how much would it have cost Damon to do that?  Probably.  Yeah, I mean.  Maybe suspended a game or something.  And maybe like $10,000.  Is that to keep from fighting kind of a thing? 
[00:40:30]  You're not allowed to go over there and start in their face.  Hey, you motherfucker.  Yeah, but I don't think that's what Johnny Damon was going to say.  I don't either.  That's just it.  Damon should have went over even if he broke the rule.  And then Major League Baseball should have done the right thing and said, ah, we're going to let this one slide.  But stupid baseball can't let anything slide ever.  No, the zero tolerance policy.  Remember Perfect Game Guy?  Perfect Game Guy.  What's his name?  Bud Seelig's a cunt.  Exactly.  Fuck that guy's moment.  I fucking hate Bud Seelig.  Because the stupid ump made the wrong call. 
[00:41:00]  And guess what?  None of us know that guy's name because he didn't get the perfect game.  And instead of overriding and doing the right thing, Bud Seelig is just such a fucking twat and a coward.  Right.  He's a coward.  Because the umpire came out and said, I blew it.  Yeah.  And how often do they do that?  Right.  Yeah.  Ah, it's part of the game.  I love these guys.  It's part of the game.  Yeah, it's part of the game.  Yeah, I was like, my mistake took you away from that kid.  Wasn't he all crying?  Yeah.  Sometimes you just do the right thing.  Of course you do.  Bud.  Soccer. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Jesus fuck.  Soccer.  Did he watch this soccer shit?  What?  The bitches with the Brazil?  Yeah, the bitches beat Brazil.  Probably every one.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  It wasn't supposed to happen.  I don't give a shit.  What does it mean?  Brazil lost?  Yeah.  All right.  And they're supposed to be really good.  Who?  Brazil.  Because the fans drive around with those giant flags attached to their car.  Are we still making believe that we like soccer in America?  No.  Who's really believing that?  I don't know.  You know where they like it?  Los Angeles. 
[00:42:00]  Los Angeles.  Yeah.  Some parts of the South.  South America?  South America.  Yeah.  And Korea.  What?  Really?  I don't know.  I, uh, yeah.  For some reason that was a big upset.  Oh, before we move on.  So we got the guy talking about catching Jeter's ball.  Oh.  Christian, could you just take us through the moment when the ball was up in the air and  it was coming down to you and what you did?  Fucking asshole. 
[00:42:30]  Everyone's an asshole.  Everyone.  Everyone's an asshole.  That's today's quote.  Everyone is an asshole.  Oh, God.  What do you think was going through his mind?  He was hoping that the ball was close enough to him and that he would have a shot at it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Catching it.  Christian, could you just take us through the moment when the ball was up in the air and  it was coming down to you and what you did?  Um, I was actually taking a picture.  Hopefully he just hit it.  And then next thing I know, I look in the air and I see my dad diving across a crowd 
[00:43:00]  of people and he missed it because he has awful hands.  And, um, the next thing I know, I just saw the ball roll in front of me and I jumped on  it.  Uh, it was just instinct.  I saw.  And no one was going to roll fatty off the ball.  So he had it.  Sorry.  He's probably a fan of the show.  What was going on with that Boston game?  Uh, oh, you didn't see that?  The Orioles aren't happy. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God.  Wasn't that great?  Because they were fucking awful.  That was hilarious.  Uh, on Friday night, I guess, there was a bench clearing brawl.  And then, uh, there was some good.  Yeah.  Boston hit a lot of Orioles over the weekend.  Yeah.  I just noticed a lot of fucking.  And there was a lot of ejections.  A lot of people getting hit with pitches.  A lot of people getting hit on Sunday.  A lot of frustrations being taken out before the all-star break.  Hilarious.  It was a lot of fun to watch.  They met your team?  Yep.  Yeah.  Good job.  Sure, yeah.  It was just instinct. 
[00:44:00]  I saw the ball.  I was like, wow, this is it.  He's good.  This is my chance.  Bruce in the middle.  Christian, I've been getting texts and tweets all day saying you're crazy.  That, you know, you should have asked for money here.  That you took a different approach.  Can you talk about why?  Um, I mean, uh, Mr. Jeter deserved it.  I'm not going to take it away from him.  Uh, yeah, money's cool and all, but I'm only 23 years old. 
[00:44:30]  I have a lot of time to make that.  Um, ah, the youth and their dumb dreams.  It's his accomplishment.  This is a milestone.  Like someone said, only 27 other people have done this.  Uh, it's not an everyday thing and he deserves every second of it.  It's all his.  He's worked so hard for 15 years or so.  And if we lived in a perfect world, that sounds like a very, very nice thing to do.  But, uh, we don't.  But he's going to be like, fucking, oh God.  If we lived in a perfect world, someone now would step up and go, you know what? 
[00:45:00]  You fucking did the right thing.  So now I'm going to do the right thing.  Maybe karma.  Pay off your student loans.  Maybe karma will help him out.  That karma doesn't work.  And he's going to get like a good job.  Like the recognition he got from this.  Somebody is going to look at him and go, now that's the kind of employee I want.  Someone that's honest.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, instead of the money, he's going to, you know.  Really?  Do the right thing.  You know what's really going to happen?  Yeah.  He's going to have to foreclose on his home and he's going to get ass cancer.  That's what karma really is.  You think karma will do the right thing, but it doesn't. 
[00:45:30]  And worse than that, he'll get a job here.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I thought I just said that.  God damn it.  Teetering on a bad mood.  Teetering on a bad mood.  I'm all right.  I'm all right right now.  Teetering.  I'm teetering.  It's like the seesaw with bad mood.  Bad mood is just a little lighter.  I told Ant.  Fuck it.  I don't.  Because it doesn't matter anymore.  When I drive by, I have to say what I told you.  When I drive by and see that Howard's limo is not here, it drives me fucking insane. 
[00:46:00]  And say what you have to.  If you want to say I'm obsessed, then say it.  But knowing this fucking guy's limo's not here.  What, did he walk?  No, he's not here for at least another week.  It puts me in an instant bad mood.  I thought he walked to work.  It was just a little later.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I don't want to confuse the issue because we're having a lot of Howard Stern fans that  started listening to us because we're doing a lot more live programming.  I'm not. 
[00:46:30]  I don't have a problem with him at all.  He is the Einstein of radio.  I don't have a problem with him.  The genius that figured out how to have a huge radio career and then get a job where  you've paid more money than anyone in radio, yet you don't have to come into work.  It's fucking brilliant.  It's mind-boggling.  So when I, I don't want to, you know, whatever, but there's a point where I see his limo.  We all do.  And when you see an empty spot, I was in a good mood and then I saw that once again. 
[00:47:00]  I'm like, instantly in a bad mood.  See, I make lemonade and think, hey, now my car can get out easier.  Don't look.  I swear to God, I never think to look.  I never think to, unless we're coming in the, in the, in the, after we're done.  I'm like, I never cursed.  And then I go, holy shit.  He's off again.  It's vacay.  It's mind boggling.  And like I said, no problem with the guy.  If you could get that deal, we certainly couldn't. 
[00:47:30]  Oh.  Then God bless you.  Fucking finance girl on that goddamn Fox business news.  Holy shit.  Is she fucking smoking?  But isn't she kind of, uh, minority-ish?  No, there's no, I'm not, I'm not sure.  It's probably like a drop of maybe Hispanic.  I don't even think that.  I think she's just very tan.  You know what?  A few drops are good.  A few drops? 
[00:48:00]  If you have a little, too many drops of that Hispanic blood.  Once they start talking like this, though.  No.  Watch the fuck out.  I'm gone.  Watch the fuck out.  Why, they're a little wild.  Touch kids.  I'm not going to the game with fucking Bobo.  You said you would.  I thought this was a done deal already.  Done.  Look at her.  Do you think she's got something in her?  Uh, yeah, she's definitely Hispanic.  Yeah?  Yeah, she's more Hispanic than, uh.  What's her fucking name?  She's more Hispanic than, uh, you probably would like it.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  She's at least half. 
[00:48:30]  Purple Pussy Lips.  Oh, they do have darker fucking.  It's darker.  Yeah.  Furt.  Furt.  Yeah, a little darker.  Almost like there's not enough blood going to that area.  Oh, really?  Like they're drying up?  Yeah.  Wow.  She's, uh.  You know what?  I would guess, uh.  I don't know, dude.  Uh.  Does anyone know her name?  It's, uh, Fox Business.  Fox Business.  And she's fucking.  She really looks good.  She's beautiful.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Fucking beautiful.  Mm-hmm.  Anyway, so that's, uh, the Dirk Jeter thing that happened over the weekend.  And Bobo game on Friday.  And Bobo game, uh, this Friday?  Oh, good.  This Friday.  It's Friday.  At what time?  Uh, let me find out.  Friday might be doable.  I might have something to do on Saturday.  He's got better seats.  Uh.  If I go to the game, I want the original seats.  What?  Those fucking.  Oh, he talked about he got an upgrade.  I got upgraded on my seats. 
[00:49:30]  Uh.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Um, let's see.  So, good for Dirk Jeter, right?  Yeah, good for him.  Good for him.  Wow, look at this thing.  Holy shit.  What the fuck is going on here?  What is Fox Business?  Fucking.  Fucking Fox Business, man.  Are they just hiring Playboy models?  Ah, the weather girl.  Like, fucking.  Holy shit.  You see the tits on her.  Look at that.  Look at her.  Like, nice hips and shit.  Damn.  Yeah, that's pretty bad. 
[00:50:00]  The Fox Business is like, yeah.  Fox is known for just, let's hire some.  Look at these.  Look at these hot chicks just yapping with each other.  During the Imus show.  They're one newscast away from buzzing out.  Oh, that would be great.  Ugh.  I guess Imus is, during the breaks, they do this.  Yeah, he's got a cushy gig, too.  He just sits there with his big head of hair.  What do you think we did wrong?  He's probably like, God damn, you see that pussy?  Oh, during the break?  Fucking amazing.  What is he doing?  What is Rob doing today? 
[00:50:30]  Gangsta Mickey.  What's that?  I don't know.  He's wearing like a Mickey Mouse hat.  A nasty Mickey Mouse hat.  And he's all nasty.  I don't know.  Is that a Mickey Mouse hat?  I'm sharing some thoughts on Twitter.  Can we get that?  Was that Gangsta Mickey like an Irish gangster?  I have no idea.  It looks like a...  We should put this on one of our TVs so I could go to it.  That's why we just talk about this and never pop the audio.  Yeah, I never actually pop the audio.  It's on one of the other TVs.  He's doing gangster...  It looks like an evil Mickey Mouse hat he's got on. 
[00:51:00]  Where's the Mickey?  I don't see it.  It looks like a cow.  See the two big round ears on top?  Oh, yeah, you're right.  You're right.  And on the bill is the rest of his face.  Oh, I see.  Yeah, you're right.  And he's got the big hands.  His eyes look like evil.  And he's wearing the gloves that are the big three-fingered hands.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  I just didn't see.  Because Fox has fucking eight fucking inches of things written so you can't see.  I want to know what gold is up to.  Gold is up $3.10 to $1,544.  Yeah, Blackstone Energy.  How much is that?  Quickly, I need to know.  Fucking eye open for two hours yet. 
[00:51:30]  I hope Disney sues Rob Bartlett and takes everything.  Oh, my God.  Poor Rob alone.  And you guys are right.  Look how high this is getting.  This used to be down here.  No, no.  The crawl used to be.  The crawl was the crawl.  That was it.  Maybe two inches of your TV on a standard TV, a basic fucking TV.  Now that's got to be pushing almost six inches.  Yeah.  Five inches, let's say.  Five inches of the TV from the bottom is now covered.  It's chopping off a lot of your television.  And then they got an inch on top that's covered. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, now at the top and then live from Washington.  It's great.  That's my goal on the compound shows, too, and I do them.  I cover the screen in so much graphics that you can barely see me.  You should just have one of your eyes.  It is.  Just like I've done that before.  You can't even see me.  There's so many graphics.  Everyone loves graphics, I guess.  Yeah.  We like to do everything but watch TV while the TV's on.  No one is reading what Morgan Stanley is.  Nobody is fucking reading what PNC Financial is. 
[00:52:30]  No one.  Oh, PNC Financial.  What did it say?  No one is reading it.  Very interested.  Fox Business, I can almost understand because that's the whole theme of the show.  Yeah.  But the bottom line, that's stupid.  What is it under?  MSNBC?  Yeah.  CNBC.  It's just the fact that it's just back.  It's just enraging.  Assholes that run television.  Easter time, 7 o'clock.  S&P Futures, 132.  DJ Futures.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  No one needs that.  Live Washington. 
[00:53:00]  They have to summarize what they're talking about in case you're listening and you're not  listening at the gym.  Right.  You ever see that when they talk about something and then they'll put a big block up with what  the guy just fucking said?  Man said words.  Oh, good.  Thanks.  Because these two fucking weird things on the side of my head didn't pick it up.  I was wondering why his mouth opened and sound spilled out of it.  Thank you.  I couldn't process what he just said.  President Obama is going to raise taxes. 
[00:53:30]  He just says President Obama is going to raise taxes.  That's what I want to do.  Read it right after he said it.  I think I just heard that.  Why do we need him?  Just fucking have the same scroll he's reading.  Scroll, scroll.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course.  Sam.  Sam's just trying to get me in a bad mood.  Fuck you.  Oh, I know.  He won't take that bad.  What is that?  Your new bit?  No.  Trying to get me in a bad mood?  No.  What do you mean?  Wait, the game that Bobo wants to take me to is on a Friday night at 7.10?  Yes.  I didn't schedule a game.  Get the fuck out of here.  I would have to leave. 
[00:54:00]  People don't understand the New York City area.  I would have to leave my apartment at 2.30 to get there comfortably.  Pick up Bobo on the way.  7?  How the fuck am I supposed to do that?  Literally, by the way.  You're not joking.  No.  Yeah.  2.30.  No, when you live in Manhattan, you have to leave the city two to three hours sooner  than you want to to get around rush hour traffic.  You've got to pick Bobo up first, though.  Oh, you do have to pick up Bobo.  I would seriously have to leave 2.30, 3 o'clock.  Or take the subways.  That's true. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, but you can't take the subways.  Seven?  Seven trains at City Field?  Yeah, there you go.  That's perfect.  I haven't been...  Plus, maybe you and Bobo could pick up lunch locally.  Well, that's true.  Pick him up early.  Nah, you want to eat at the stadium.  You want some City Field hot dogs.  Bobo.  Yeah, I'm here.  Are you insane?  How am I supposed to get to a Friday 7-10 game?  No, the game's on Saturday. 
[00:55:00]  Oh.  So this means nothing, Sam.  What happened, Sam?  You just blew it.  You're erroneous.  Information there.  You're saying the game's on Saturday.  At what time?  That's at 4.  Saturday at 4.  Perfect.  That's the perfect time to go to a game by the way.  So it's the complete opposite of what Sam put up on the screen.  Sam was just trying to get you mad.  It's the complete opposite, so...  You hung up on him.  Oh, shit. 
[00:55:30]  I didn't even realize that.  We're going to take a break.  We've just talked for an hour and a half.  Oh.  Holy moly.  Language.  We've got to eat.  Yeah.  Gots to eat.  Trying to see what we could tease here.  I don't know.  Tease them.  Maybe the woman dying from fucking a dog.  Is that real?  That's not.  It's not.  My dick is hard for nothing.  And we'll tell you about the weekend box office after this. 
[00:56:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  The Pope was overheard.  Motherfucking AT&T service.  Doodly-doo. 
[00:56:30]  He said this iPhone's a piece of shit and threw it off the balcony.  Who-de-de-doo.  What we have here is the best of both worlds.  The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer.  On-board memory.  And 30 years of human experience and interaction.  BoboCop, what are your prime directives?  To serve the public trust.  Protect the innocent.  Uphold the law.  And to jerk off in a toilet, all right?  Part man.  Part robot.  Complete imbecile. 
[00:57:00]  Alive or dead.  Dead or alive, bureau.  What am I supposed to say?  Hey, fuck you, you metallic mongoloid.  Eat a bowl of dick.  Will he be able to recall his past memories?  Don't you remember?  Bobo, it's you.  What's me?  You, Bobo.  It's you.  Who is?  Holy fuck, Bobo.  You.  It's you.  Bobo, it's you.  I think I'm in a weak signal area.  K9 units, please respond.  We have a 63 in progress. 
[00:57:30]  All right, let's go, Mr. Maloon again.  Bobo Cop.  Who is he?  What is he?  I suck.  The dumbest, most annoying person on the planet is now a law-enforcing cyborg.  Bobo Cop.  Bobo Cop.  Any special message for the kids at home?  Believe me, all right, you got to wear a condom when you go to sleep because you don't want  to jizz in your pants when you, when you're-  Bobo Cop.  Sorry, sorry.  I mean, I mean, stay out of trouble.  Bobo Cop. 
[00:58:00]  I would be able to control the boner if this was more like expected to happen, but I didn't  expect you'd be here in studio.  What an adorable little boner.  Oh, it's a lovely surprise that I am very thankful for.  Oh, I love surprises.  It's a lovely gift.  It feels like Christmas already.  Oh, you're Christmas all over my shirt.

[00:59:30]  What's up, this is Joe Rogan  You are listening to the Opie Anthony Show  My favorite show in the history of the fucking universe  Bob Kelly coming in today  Bobby  And Bryan Cranston  Yes, Bryan Cranston  From Breaking Bad  Breaking Bad  Not only that, but  He was also Malcolm in the Middle  Remember that 
[01:00:00]  Was he Malcolm?  No, he was the dad  And he was Dr. Tim Watley  The dentist on Seinfeld  Yeah  That character  Pretty goddamn funny  Let me see  Oh, you'll recognize him in a second  Oh, that guy  That's his doctor, Tim Watley  But then you can get him as Malcolm Dad  Guy  You know  And yeah, he's been in a few things  But he's in Breaking Bad now  Really good 
[01:00:30]  Yeah  That guy  That guy  I know that guy  Oh, right on, man  Let me say hi to Bryan in Philly real fast  Bryan  Hey, good morning Opie  Anthony, Jimmy  Opie, I just wanted to say  Thank you for recommending Horrible Bosses  I saw it yesterday  It was very good  Not going to give out any spoilers  But the cameo of Nick's boss  At the end was very good  And you were right about Jennifer Aniston  She was just smoking  She really was  Jennifer Aniston 
[01:01:00]  Looking good  I'm telling you  As far as mainstream comedies go  Horrible Bosses definitely did the job  Yeah  I was following it on Twitter a little bit  It seemed like most people really enjoyed Horrible Bosses  Yeah, I was kind of surprised about how edgy some of the jokes were  Like Wet Work was very interesting  Yes, absolutely  And Charlie Day is just a fucking superstar now  Yeah  From Always Sunny  He's now a legitimate movie star  Horrible Bosses 
[01:01:30]  Not too bad on Rotten Tomatoes  72 positive reviews  80% positive reviews from  From the audience  From the audience  Audience members, yeah  And Horrible Bosses beat out Zookeeper  Yeah  Which is surprising because Zookeeper was everywhere  The marketing and the promotion for Zookeeper  Sorry  I feel bad that we trashed you  Because we know a few guys in that movie  But I think they're just doing voices  We've trashed other movies we've known people in  It's  To be honest  It's Kevin James I got the problem with 
[01:02:00]  14 positive reviews for Zookeeper, huh?  Wow  Can you go back to that?  Good  What are the people  What's the percentage of people?  Wow  55% of the people going to see it  And 55% like it  Oh, it was so funny  The talking animals  Talking animal movies stink  Dude  I guess they did a Kevin James weekend on TV 
[01:02:30]  Because that  Oh yeah  That Chuck and Larry  Yeah  Yeah  I had a tweet  I was just laying in bed with my kid  Just mellowing out  I think it was napping or whatever  And it was on in the background  I'll be honest with you  Because I didn't change the channel  I forgot what was on before that  And Adam Sandler actually said in this movie  It's like the prom king  Dating the tuba player  So I just tweeted that  And then wrote  Oh, that Adam Sandler is hilarious  And then I put hilarious in all caps  And people don't understand fucking Twitter  They're like 
[01:03:00]  That's not hilarious  I'm like  That's why I'm writing this  You dopes  There are so many literal people on Twitter  That really  They just  They're people with no sense of humor  They don't understand that you're goofing on someone  But I understand the people  That then will say  That's not hilarious  And they're showing their sarcasm back  But then there's other people  That are like  No, they thought  I tweeted that  As a funny line from a movie  They honestly mean it  Yeah  Yeah  And I put hilarious in caps  Going  This is the giveaway  If you put hilarious in caps 
[01:03:30]  It usually means  It's not fucking hilarious  Yes  What a horrible line  Yeah, horrid  It's like the prom king  Dating  Or seeing  What does it mean?  Well, because they're  Like they're gay in the movie  Or they have to be fake gay  And Adam Sandler was like  Fuck, if I was going to be gay  I would, you know  Pick someone hotter than you  Or in better shape than you  And then said  It's like the prom king  Meaning he's kind of more of a prom king  And Kevin James is more like  The tuba player 
[01:04:00]  Oh, gotcha  Still not funny  Yeah  Still not funny at all  I was stupefied  I'm like  This line made a movie  Uh, what?  You said it was hilarious  Yeah, I did say it was hilarious  Fuck you  Yeah, wait a minute  Fuck you  You're dead  Fuck you  You guys are talking about  Really funny movies  So I thought I would  Come in and ask you  If you saw the new  Adam Sandler trailer  Uh-oh  For Jack and Jill  It must be really bad  Because Twitter exploded  Like, did you even see this thing?  Like, bad  Like, hey, this is good 
[01:04:30]  Because that's what it is  Yeah, yeah  Like Michael Jackson  I don't even want to  I don't even want to  Play around with this  Oh, boy  Jack and Jill  People said  This looks horrendous  I haven't seen it yet  Yeah, this takes too long  You know, Danny always turns that  So this is going to be  Adam Sandler's next big hit  For some reason  Hit after hit for this guy  Jack and Jill  This is the preview  I haven't seen it yet  Yes, it's got to be good  It's just green right now  In every family  There's one person  Who drives you a little crazy 
[01:05:00]  Yeah  I gotta pick Jill up  At four in the morning  She comes once a year  And she's leaving on Sunday  But during the holidays  Jack  No fighting this year  There's no escaping it  When it's your sister  How we doing?

[01:05:30]  No way  Are you fucking kidding me?  So he goes to the airport  To pick up his sister  For some reason  They're the only people  In the airport  And she's at the baggage carousel  Oh, by the way  Her back is turned  Yeah  Let's point out all the shit  That doesn't make sense  Yeah, it's the holiday season  He's at the airport  And he's the only one in the airport  To pick up his sister  Yeah, I'm guessing  That might have been  Some kind of problem  Yeah  Her back is turned  So you see her long hair  And it's like  His sister  And she turns around 
[01:06:00]  The big reveal  And it's Adam Sandler  Dressed like a chick  And that's why  Oh, no  That's why Hollywood sucks  By the way  Why give that away?  Why give that away?

We're just hoping  The name Adam Sandler  Brings in some people  Oh, my God  Starring Adam Sandler  And Adam Sandler  No, it only gets better  Oh, yeah  Oh, chip-like  Yeah  Yeah  Let's do this 
[01:06:30]  Oh, no  I want the big reveal  Escaping it  When it's your sister  How we doing?  Your twin sister  Are you going bald?  Huh?  No, no, no  You're getting fatter  And your hair doesn't realize  It needs to cover more face  Okay  From the producers  Pause again  Oh, no  Yay  So that's the voice  That you're going to have to listen to  During this whole movie  Is Adam Sandler trying to put on a chick voice?  And if you listen to the interaction  There's no chemistry  Because they can't go back and forth 
[01:07:00]  Because they can't  Yeah, it's, you know  It's  It's  They can't do it  The whole movie has no chemistry  Because they weren't there together  No  This is terrible  All right  Let's hit this again  No, no, no  You're getting fatter  And your hair doesn't realize  It needs to cover more face  Okay  From the producers of Just Go With It  And Grown Ups  These men and Jill are so alike  We got nothing alike  I promise you  She isn't subtle

Everybody hears you  She isn't shy  I put a little list together  Things I want to do before I leave  Studio tour  Beach  Horseback riding  Let's go!  Oh my God!  Maybe I should stay out through Hanukkah  And she isn't leaving  She's forwarding her mail to herself!  What's this about a twin?  Oh, Jackie has a twin sister 
[01:08:00]  Identical or paternal?  Nocturnal  Like a bat  This is why  Seriously, honey?

[01:10:00]  It turns into the wig  Yeah  To be in the wig  It's one thing like a big circle  I'm playing Phil Spector  But shorter  Holy shit  Okay, alright  This is so bad  One more minute  Yeah  What?

Some twins can feel when the other one's hurt  I didn't feel it  A little harder  No, Jill, stop it  He's kidding  What?  Oh!  Did you hear that, Daddy?  I actually did feel something there  Pride in my son  Oh, and they went for the 11-11-11 release 
[01:12:00]  11-11-11  That's clever  The numbers are all the same  That's a twin thing, right?  11-11-11  I can't even  I can't convey  Be more funny  My line of work  Is communicating  Is the ability  To take something  That the people maybe  Can't see  Do not know about  Some new experience, perhaps  And convey it to the audience  In a way that they will understand 
[01:12:30]  I can't do it with this  271 likes  1,900 dislikes  That looked  Like shit  That guy is almost a billionaire  Bad mood  Wait, what happened to us?  Remember we were supposed to get him in the studio or something?  What happened with that?  For this one, he's going to come running through the window  No, no, no  Who did we take that we were supposed to get?  Brooklyn Decker 
[01:13:00]  And then Adam Sandler was going to come in and he didn't  And we had Nick, too  Nick Schwartzen  We promoted Just Go With It Heavily for those guys  And supposedly we were supposed to get him  Okay, it's like my twin sister here  Maybe we'll get him for Jack and Jill  Jack and Jill  I'm going on record right now  I'm not going to fake this one  If he comes in, I'm going to tell him how bad his fucking movie is  I'm sorry  I don't give a fuck it's Adam Sandler  This movie stinks  Awful  You know what's missing, by the way?  Rob Schneider  Well, I'm sure he's in some 
[01:13:30]  Oh, you think he's going to have a little time here?  That's the surprise they left out of the trailer  The homeless guy at the dinner table was the guy that's in all of the movies  He gets the same  Are we going to get Adam Sandler?  He's going to go to the  What happened last time  What happened last time was when we were promised  They were working out of schedule to come here  They grabbed him at the Super Bowl series  To do two and a half, three hours of different channels  So he thought, okay, I fulfilled my serious agreement  They were not blaming you  I see that you came in here thinking that we were blaming you  Was that a yes or a no, by the way? 
[01:14:00]  With what?  He asked him a simple question  What?  Is Adam Sandler coming here?  He talked  I didn't know  I still don't know  I asked him the other question  I didn't hear that for first  Oh  But he didn't want to do our show  It was just an obligation  It's like, why didn't you take him?  First of all, I wasn't blaming you  Oh, no, no  I see how you came in here, though  Yeah  You had your  Oh, no, no  Is that noise you make?  But we weren't blaming you  We knew something got fucked up  Oh, yeah, yeah, no  I believe you when you tell me that we might get Adam Sandler  Yeah, they're working 
[01:14:30]  Now you're saying that  He had to do a lot of Super Bowl shit for Sirius XM  And then Adam figured  Well, I did satellite radio  Yeah, when he came to New York  I wanted to have to wake up early  If I did three hours  In Dallas  That's good  At least he wants to do the show  You know what Rob Schneider's going to do, by the way?  What?  Guaranteed, he goes  Two can do it!  Oh, I like that  For the two of them  Like, we'll have to do something  And it'll be the twin thing  And it'll be in the double dutch scene  Right  Two can do it!  I'm going to guess he's going to be some kind of Fu Manchu character  Oh, you think? 
[01:15:00]  Fu Manchu character?  Or she can't fall from the air  And he catches them  Oh  I don't know one thing Rob Schneider's done on film  I've never watched one of his movies  Oh, jeez  You don't know  Never  He's in every Adam Sandler movie  All of his movies should be left out in the sun  Dude, I've never seen a Sandler movie  I'm not lying to him  I'm trying to think if I've seen moments of, like, Little Nicky  Did you see Billy Madison?  No  No  I'm not interested  There's a few Adam Sandler movies that definitely were good  I'm sure there's some great ones 
[01:15:30]  Definitely were good  I'm interested  But he's had a lot of bad movies at this point  A lot of bad movies  Bombs  And I don't know how this Jack and Jill movie is going to do well  It has all the features, though  So it'll probably be another family comedy crowd  No, that wasn't him  What, what?  I was going to say  Didn't he just do the Penguin movie?  That was Jim Carrey  Jim Carrey  That was another one that used to be funny  Remember when Jim Carrey was funny?  Yeah  God, he used to be great  He said they're thinking about Dumb and Dumber, too  I said, back to the well 
[01:16:00]  There you go  But didn't they do the other Dumb and Dumber?  No, they did Dumb and Dumber-er  And that wasn't him, though  No  So now they're going to go back  They grabbed two people  Different timelines  It looked like them  Wow  Well, now I know what everyone was talking about on Twitter  Because everyone was like  You've got to see this trailer  I'm like  It's good  I can't  What are some of the major problems here?  Who's been fucking  Some of the comments are just horrific  262 people are indisputably retarded  Is one of the comments  Who's been fucking with my medicine? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, this is going to be a good one  I'm going to, you know  Kind of exercise my comic jobs  Yeah  I like the ugly, tall, tranny girl  She looks like Adam Sandler  Oh, God  Come on  First you get the power  Then you get the woman  You say tranny  You say tranny  But you know what  At least that 
[01:17:00]  You know, there's a lot of jokes there  If it was a twin brother  But he goes away  And comes back as a chick  Then maybe he got something  Right  Maybe  It's like the change-up  Huh?  The change-up  That's coming out  What's the change-up?  With Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman  Oh  It looks like it's been done  No, if you see the previews  Who would see a fucking movie with those two?  No  It's a comedy  Whatever it is  With who?  It sounds terrible 
[01:17:30]  Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman  The change  Maybe I'm wrong  What's the change?  Advertisement  Yeah, it'll be one of these  You know  Do that  Do that  I hate trailers  I hate the music  I fucking hate the music  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do  Like when the music starts  Yeah  You ready?  Let's get a little  Let's get a little of those  It's movie trailer time, people  Hold your laughter  The change-up  Let's see this  It's your turn 
[01:18:00]  I'm awake  Yay  Porno  Ah, shoot him  Ah, shoot him  Family man  So what am I tonight, a burglar?  Oh  Hello  Alright, pause this  Because there's a lot of writing  So basically the concept  Jason Bateman is the family man  Family guy  He's got a wife, the kid  Right  His turn to get up in the middle of the night 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, yeah  He's like, oh God  My life sucks  But, uh, wow  But his pal, I guess  Are they friends?  Oh yeah  Yeah  Of course they are  Is the party guy  He's the single guy  Right  Van Wilder  Van Wilder, of course  A hot chick walks in  Hot chick  And she drops her coat  To show that she's  Yeah  And he makes the dumb guy face  Because that's what you do  When a chick shows her cunt  Hey  Hey  What am I doing that?  Yeah, that's what happens 
[01:19:00]  Every time a chick is saucy and dominant  You go back and look at the face  What happens?  Whoa  He is, he's making it up  Whoa, never seen one of those before  Whoa  That's your pussy and clit  What do I do?  Do I make the oipety oipety oipety on them?  They're so sick of that shit  Whoa  Every fucking guy in a movie  With a chick strips  Instead of just grabbing her tits  Or biting her nipples  Like we would do  Okay  Bang  Bang 
[01:19:30]  Bang  You get instantly stupid  Yeah  Wow  Alright  So now we got the concept  You got the family man  And the single man  Yeah, something's gonna happen here  Is there gonna be some  It'll be funny if it's a rape  Like the whole thing is a drama  About a rape  Like it just gets serious  All of a sudden  It has to do with pee-pee  I'm gonna guess that  It's some kind of hocus pocus  It is, but with pee-pee  Friday  With pee-pee  And now it's gonna lead into  A problem I have 
[01:20:00]  With these type of movies  So he's gonna become  A single man  But the entire movie  Doesn't fuck one broad  No, I think I know what happens  I guarantee this is what happens  You think that?  And I think that that blonde girl  There was an incident  And she winds up dead  Like at Phil Spector's house  And then he has to go on trial  And the married guy  Has to fucking water his plants  And that's the whole movie  That's a great movie  I would see that  Here we go  Tell me about your women  I have been keeping company  With a number of nice ladies 
[01:20:30]  What is her name?  That is Tatiana  Wow  I have to make her cry first  Tatiana  Yeah, this right here is Brenda  She wants it in  Wheelbarrow  Arabian goggles  The Arsenio Hall  The pastrami sandwich  I don't even know what these are  You're married  Good point  We're living the dream  It stinks  Because being married just sucks  So he tells the guy  Like all those positions  And it's like  Yeah, man  Yeah, you  Just stop  I'm giving her Arabian goggles  And that's the way guys talk 
[01:21:00]  Yeah  She likes the wheelbarrow  So what's it like?  She likes me to lick her ass  A little bit  Right  She likes me to put my dick  Between her tits  And come on her eye  No, no, no  Why would you talk like guys do?  Well, you know  She likes the hat  She likes the hat mustache  Well, what's that?  Well, you know  And then  To another scene  Fucking faggity dialogue  Also, there's a couple things happening  I don't know if we can find it  Because it's tough to find  South Park clips online  But I guess they did a parody  Of the Adam Sandler trailer already  Oh, did they?  If we could take a quick look 
[01:21:30]  To see if that's around  Well, we gotta finish  Yeah, let's continue with this  The changeup  From the writers of The Hangover  And Wedding Crasher  Yeah  You're living the dream  It's having children  It's like it's living with  Little mini drug addicts  You know, they're laughing one minute  And then they're crying the next  And then they're trying to kill themselves  In your bathroom  For no good reason  They're very mean and selfish  And they burn through your money  And they break shit  Guy, guy, guy, guy, come on  You know, I was just saying  That I envy your life, man  I envy your life  I wish I had your life  Oh, no!  They were peeing in the wrong fountain 
[01:22:00]  They're peeing in a fountain together  And lightning happens  And they both said  I wish I had your life  And then lightning strikes  And let me tell you  I know what happens  They start sucking each other off  That's right  They go to some golden showers  And then the fucking single guy  Starts fucking the wife  Of the married guy  And the kids take videos  And Uncle Paul comes in  And goes to jail  It sucks  It's idiotic  Oh, I can't wait  See, now the twist  Which, of course, they give away  In the trailer  So now we know 
[01:22:30]  What's going to be happening  And I want to make my point again  But Hollywood has to stick  With their stupid morality  And even though they switch roles  You're not going to see  The married guy fucking anything  And his single friend  Is not going to fuck the wife  Really?  Yes, that's how all these movies play out  And it drives me nuts  It's like, go with the fucking concept  All the way  And stop with that morality shit  Did you be shitting on the wife's face?  Just smearing shit  From his ass  Nothing ever happens  Of course, where else would it come from?  No, no  What's that?  Oh, what? 
[01:23:00]  I'm sorry  It's like smearing shit  From his ass  Like it would come from somewhere  I'm an idiot  Let's go  Here comes the switcheroo  It's seven  Oh, they wake up  Wait, what?  Bitch  Why am I in your apartment?  Open the door  I knew it  You wished for my life  Or we were pissing in that fountain 
[01:23:30]  You wished we had each other's lives  I was just trying to be nice  Oh, my God  Oh, boy  Ryan Reynolds  So why can't they realize  That they didn't want that to happen  So why don't they just go back to their lives?  And just move along  I'm going to guess  Everybody accepts them as this now  Oh, crap  That's the magic  But they weren't  And no one else was near the fountain  With the lightning  So how would they accept it?  Did you see how it goes?  Ryan Reynolds is Jason Bateman  Jason Bateman is Ryan Reynolds 
[01:24:00]  Ryan Reynolds  The vomiting, good-looking guy  Wait  And Rob Schneider is the stabler  Roland, do you think this is a good movie?  Yeah, Roland  Be honest  Roland, comment  Be honest  He came in here thinking  Be honest  Probably I'll go see it, yes  Are we going to get these guys in for this movie, probably?  They're not promoting the movie  Who wants them anyway?  Literally  Who wants to talk to them?  They're not promoting it  No, I don't want to talk to them  What do we say?  I don't care  I don't care or is it care? 
[01:24:30]  I just messed that up  Technically, I couldn't care  We all say I could care less  Thank you  I couldn't care less  You know what?  We all do, right?  In this day and age, it's become interchangeable  So shut the fuck up next time  It's tweeted  Like Ryan Reynolds and Jason  Interchangeable  Yeah, hit it  Oh yeah  For the first time in your life  You're good-looking  You're single  What's going on between us?  It's crazy  But what's even more crazy is not to use it  Have we met?  Hold on  You two guys should go out  Wait, what?  How do you like working with Dave?  I actually used to have kind of a crush on Dave  Oh no, you didn't 
[01:25:00]  No, but he's married, so obviously  Right, obviously  Obviously  Yeah  Obviously  Yeah  Super married  What do I tell Jamie when she wants to have sex tonight?  You're not having sex with my wife, bitch  She comes to me like a hurricane  A guy can only withstand so much  Funny music  I'm going to ruin her  Oh my God  I need to cool it on the Thai food  Oh my God  Ah, see, that's your way out  You're shitting  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
[01:25:30]  Don't back that thing up into me  I can't believe you'd come at me  Guns hot  See, you're right  That's the morality thing  You hit that nail on the head  It drives me nuts when they do these type of movies  And they use  But at least they spun in this movie  She has fucking explosive diarrhea  And that's why she can't have sex with a guy  That's that  That's officially married in the movie  And he becomes disgusted  Right  With her  Because she's shit in front of him  Right, right  And, you know  Yeah  Oh, boy  That's always drove me nuts  Wow  The morality bullshit  Wow  It's a movie  You fucking just do it  Who cares 
[01:26:00]  Wow  That looks fucking heinous  Horrid  That looks really bad  These movies just passed us by  No  Because these movies all do well  No  They all do well  They do  But bad boys  Like, most of the times  When I do go to a movie  I'm disappointed  Horrible Bosses  I was not disappointed  But most of the time  I'm like, what the fuck  Did Hollywood just pass me by  And they're not making movies for me?  Because then you go around  Your regular life  And people will tell you  How great Grown Ups was 
[01:26:30]  I fucking hated that movie  Ugh  But they'll tell you  Oh, that was a fun movie  Oh, yeah  Family enjoyed it  Oh, fantastic  What is going on, really?  Oh, we laughed and laughed  I think we're in the minority  I really do  Maybe, but  I mean, not our show in general  Because I think a lot of the people  That listen to us  Are in the same boat  But we're only like a niche  Of society  We're harder to make laugh  Because of what we do for a living  First of all  It's hard  Because when you're doing comedy 
[01:27:00]  All the time  And you're around it all the time  And you're always thinking  In that vein  You look at it differently  Like, you don't just look  And go for the  Like, you kind of see things coming  And it's not about being smarter  It's just about being annoyed  When you see them  Like, most people wouldn't care  That that guy's not gonna fuck the wife  But you saw that coming  You're like, oh, that's fucking annoying  I think that's part of it  I've gotten more jaded  And I'm sure you guys have too  Of just being around  And being around comedians all the time  Or just, you know  Whatever it is  I think you're right  With the jaded part 
[01:27:30]  But I also feel like  Somewhere  I don't even know when  But comedy started getting  Really fucking lame  It's gotten soft  When we grew up  We had some good fucking comedies  That didn't  Didn't cop out, man  Because they go  There's always been cutesy comedies  But these wouldn't be annoying  If there was some kind of a balance  But there's so few ballsy comedies  That when they say faggot  Now it's a big deal  So it's annoying  The whole thing's annoying  And I think they adjusted  I think when we were growing up  They made comedies  Maybe for guys 
[01:28:00]  Yes  And sure, some women would  Enjoy a good guy's comedy  But nowadays  They're like, fuck that  Why would you exclude all the women?  We should make a comedy  That, you know  Guys and gals like  Yeah, because I want to make  A hundred million  Right  I mean, it's just so much  Like, look at Mall Cop  It's not my style  But it pulled in  A hundred fucking million  And that's why I don't get it  For a comedy  I don't get it  Because families can go see it  I sat through that  And I finally turned it off  I hate saying the same shit  But you could take  But 45 minutes in  I'm like, I can't do this anymore  I didn't have one laugh 
[01:28:30]  If your son was 10  And wanted to go to a movie  And you and Linz  Want to go to a movie  You could actually go to see that  And go, you know what  He'll get a few laughs  Out of this  We'll  Right  It's like, they just  They know how to get money  Out of fucking  The mother, the father, the kid  The date  The date's parents  Like, they just figured out  How to get everybody  In the same room  Yeah  I don't know  It just  Like, Blazing Saddles  Was not made for  Right, you wouldn't bring  Your 10 year old to see that  Or for women  Right  In general  In general  I don't want to be  No, no, it's true 
[01:29:00]  I'm too biased  But, you know  But some  I don't know  I don't know when  It started changing  I don't know  90s?  Early 90s, maybe?  Before that  They didn't  They didn't care  Yeah, like 80s movies  They didn't give a shit  Caddyshack wasn't really  Made for women  Right, no  A lot of women  Enjoyed the movie  Yes, of course  And they've made men  And Nick talks about this a lot  But they've made the guys  In movies acceptable  And pussies  But again  That gets the women  In there too  And the women enjoy it  They say it was great  And they spend a lot of money  Because don't forget  It's not like  30 years ago  Less women worked 
[01:29:30]  Less women were  Viable in the workplace  And now they're out  Spending as much money  As guys in a lot of cases  So they want them  To come to the same movies  At what expense though?  Come on  No  At the expense of anything funny  I know  I know they could be  Making better comedies  I just know it  In my fucking soul  If I had to  If I was an exec producer  And I wanted  Did I want  I mean  Observe and Report  Made me laugh harder  Than Mall Cop  I didn't see Mall Cop  But I know that  That would make me laugh harder  But if I was an exec producer  I'd want to be on Mall Cop 
[01:30:00]  Not the other one  And that's a great example  Because we bring that up a lot  Mall Cop and Observe and Report  Were very similar movies  But Observe and Report  Was much edgier  Yeah  Mean  Mean and all that  I want to know the gross  Between those two movies  And I  I  I would put my reputation  On the line  That Observe and Report  Was a much better movie  Than Mall Cop  Yeah  But I bet Mall Cop  Made a lot more money  Well we know that  100 and something million  To like 40 million  Could you find that out Sam  And that's not even  I don't even know  If that was worldwide  Like worldwide  Observe and Report 
[01:30:30]  I mean  Mall Cop  Kevin James is just  A likable guy man  He's a likable dude  He's silly  People are like  Oh boy  Yeah  Oh here's the fat guy  Yeah  Doing some wacky things  Let's  He's not even fat anymore  But he has that vibe  That like  I hate stupid people  Like Michelle on Long Island  Go ahead stupid  Stupid  Did you hear what I said  Blazing Saddles  Was really good  Madeline Conn  Was in there  She was for women  She was great  So why am I out of my mind  Because you're saying 
[01:31:00]  That it wasn't made for women  I said in general  Blazing Saddles  Was not made for women  But I also acknowledge  That a lot of women  Certainly like the movie  Cranky fuck  Change your fucking tampon  Oh boy  You're not  I get cranky  When you're not listening  And now she hangs up  She's nailing you over  Did you understand the point I made  It doesn't matter  She nailed you  Alright  You get the win today Michelle  Congratulations  My point was  Those movies were not made for women  No  But some women enjoyed it 
[01:31:30]  Yes  Of course  That means you're better  Than most women Michelle  Congratulations  That's right  Alright  Mall Cop  146.3 million  Wow  Observe and Report  Which Jimmy and I saw  And think was a much better movie  24 million  Only 24  Wow  And that's why they do  That's why  And that's why they do  What they're doing  Yeah  Because that right there  That's the public speaking  That's not just us being jaded  Right  That's people  That's the fucking  And I'm sure one was marketed better  One look  But that is people  Because Seth Rogen's a big fucking comedy star 
[01:32:00]  Seth was hilarious  Anna Faris is in that  Anna Faris is so fucking funny  Ray Liotta  Anna Faris could be the funniest brought out there  Yeah she's hysterical  She's funny even in really bad movies  Yeah  Which is a talent  There's not many people that can pull that off  Oh you can  Maybe Observe and Report  Sometimes the name is weird  Like  Mall Cop  You know what that is  You see him riding that little Segway  You know this is a silly movie about a guy  Who probably nobody likes as a cop in the mall 
[01:32:30]  Or the mall security guy  When you see numbers like that  Now you know why they  Make Jack and Jill  Absolutely  And the rest of this horse shit  Because you know  The numbers don't lie  They're making a lot of money off these dumb  Horrible silly movies  There is an art to it  Like I mean  I couldn't write a movie like that  Because it wouldn't come out  It just would come out terrible  But there's a way to make these movies  Where everybody kind of likes them  There's a certain genre for it  It's like you know  Like kind of just PG comedy  You know  And then you know  Grown Ups fucking 
[01:33:00]  These movies make a lot of money man  Grown Ups made what  I think 200 million  Oh it was crazy  Yeah  I hated that fucking movie  And I try to watch some of these movies  I really do  To see what the buzz is about  I wish I enjoyed them  It's hitting me hard  Michelle I'm sorry  I apologize to Michelle today  I wish I enjoyed a lot of these  162  162  Kevin James  In two comedies  Made fucking 300 million  Do you know how unheard of that is?  In two fucking comedies? 
[01:33:30]  You know there's a hundred guys  I'd rather have on the show  Before Kevin James too  He's a nice guy  No I'm not even joking  I know he's a nice guy  I know it  I've met him  He's a very nice guy  He's funny yeah  But as far as keeping my interest  And someone I would love to just hang with  On this show  And watch be funny  A hundred guys before him  Easily  Easily  I gotta see the South Park Jack and Jill  Goof now  You got it?  Yeah  Some goofing on that twins movie  Adam Sandler is Jack  Adam Sandler is Jill 
[01:34:00]  Oh god  Dude  You said you wouldn't say everything looks like shit  Sorry if I see things for what they are  Okay okay I'm sorry  This November  Adam Sandler shits in your eyes, ears and mouth  It's Adam Sandler in  Rated ARC for Pirates  F*** you  That is pretty good  How can you say that looks good?  You're doing it again  Is that it? 
[01:34:30]  That's it  Yeah  Basically saying the movie's shit  Is that from the show?  That was the episode where  Shit's in your mouth  They can say  That's great  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I guess Stan figures he's growing up a little bit  Yeah  Mall cop is for eight year olds  Really?  Is that what they're doing though?  You bring the eight year old  But of course you can't  I'm dropping my eight year old off at the movies  F*** it  Is that what you're doing?  They're not going to get me  Dropping off?  Where it's two tickets instead of one  My eight year old's going to have to learn  How to f***ing go to movies by himself 
[01:35:00]  When I was like seven  Me and my friends walked to the movie together  Yeah  Alone  But that's what's happening  Great  Saw King Kong first run  Yeah  All right  They make these movies  You've got to buy a ticket for your kid  And one for yourself  Because you don't want to leave them alone  Yeah  That's why these movies are making so much money  Yep  And the theaters want them  Because they're obviously sold out  And they're f***ing buying soda  You know  Everyone makes money  They should have a bar in the back  For the  You know  The fathers  Let the kids sit and enjoy the horse  Oh my god  You have a few beers in the back  Right  Nice bar  That would be a nice concept

That's a good one  Thanks  Earlier in the show  Ant was talking about his party there  Bob Kelly  Just to bring you up to speed  Right  And he was talking about  How do you want to do this  In case the people didn't hear earlier 
[02:11:00]  I'm wondering if we do give it away or not  At first  Did he finally  Should we just play this?  Well this is what Ant was talking about  To start the show  Because then that will make people get all shocked  Yeah, yeah  You know  Some leftovers  It's going to ruin somebody's life, is it?  Nah  I hope so  Not at all  I hope Glad's not listening today  Oh boy  Because Ant went on a fucking rant this morning  I don't even remember this  Sure  I had this big 4th of July party, right?  Oh boy  I won't give it this way again  Oh  Oh boy  Fucking 
[02:11:30]  I just  I literally made this sound  I was disgusted  I couldn't imagine how many there were  I haven't seen one in a while, thank God  I couldn't look at them  And now I'm like  Alright, I'll get the hose  And I'm hosing these motherfuckers off, right?  Where are you hosing them to, though?  So I got just into like  Off of any walkways and shit  You should have hosed them right into your neighbor's yard  Well, I was hosing them into the grass  Yeah  You know, I'm just like hosing, fucking 
[02:12:00]  And they're just flying  And then, uh, I noticed  A few minutes later  They're all marching in one direction  Back onto the cement  They have radar?  I don't know  They got some kind of f***ing memory  Why the f*** when you film this?  I was horrified  How do f*** this form?  Fucking f***s go and lay their dumb eggs  And the gestation period I think is 6 minutes  And these f***ing f***s are all over the place  That's why I will never defeat the f***  No  No  The f*** is king 
[02:12:30]  You should have filmed this  No, it was something that I was like  I can't f***ing believe it's disgusting  Oh, it's terrible  You should have f***ing filmed it  A short f*** film  That sucks, dude  It sucked dealing with f***s  So I finally got everything to f*** free  And I had to sit down with a glass of wine  To unwind  Because, wow  It was horrifying  Need a shorter beep  I think the beep should be right at the beginning  So you leave the whole  Agates 
[02:13:00]  The only thing is agates  It should be  Agates  You did that  It shouldn't be  I didn't get it at all  Yeah, yeah  You can't get it  Unless  I couldn't hear what the word  Should we try it again?  A smaller beep  Try it again with just a little beep over the M part  Yes  And then you'll know that  Because then  I mean, because the first one sets up the whole thing  Because the difference between maggot and faggot  Is, you know  It's just a beep over the M  And then it'll sound like, you know  Faggots are all over and stuff like that  Right, right  I thought you were talking about something else 
[02:13:30]  Neighbors yard and all that  I know  No  I didn't have a problem with chiggers  They were maggots  I have a lot of bug problems  But  You want to do a chigger in?

[02:24:00]  But nobody believes me  Because my boss and I  Don't get along  He's tough as nails  But I don't play by the rules  Because I'm a child molester  And coincidentally  I'm in D.C.  Because there's a young lad  Who I want to molest  In a Motel 8  Sounds familiar  And his uncle  Happens to work for the White House  And that's how it happens  I run out of the motel room  And the little lad's tough skins  Are around his knees  Is that the dangerous springs

[02:31:30]  C.O.C.  Nice  I don't remember this  I finally went to a concert this weekend  I went and saw Soundgarden  I saw it too  Soundgarden  You went and saw Soundgarden where?  I was in Otter at the Blues Fest  Doing the Just for Laughs  And right after my  Actually during my show  People were walking out  And I thought they were offended  But Soundgarden started like  At 8 o'clock  So they were just like  We're out of here  Yeah  So I went across 
[02:32:00]  He was fucking  Unbelievable  Chris Cornell has a great voice  Jesus Christ  Someone asked me over the weekend  Chris Cornell or Lane Staley  I had to go with Lane Staley  But I love Chris Cornell's voice  Chris Cornell  I would never hear Lane Staley again  Yeah I know  Chris Cornell's voice live is fucking incredible  But that was a tough one  I'll be honest  Because I love them both  I just feel bad  I really like when Chris Cornell slows it down  Because his voice is ridiculous  That's the original band right?  Huh?  The original band he's playing with?  I'm not going to front  I don't really know  I would assume most of the guys are original 
[02:32:30]  Yeah  I feel bad for like  God touches like one person in the band  And says Chris  You will look good  You are the guy  You will be the guy forever  And then the bassist  And the guitarist  And the drummer  You will look like shit  You will get old  You have to cut your hair  Yeah yeah  You have to wear fucking bowling shirts  Did you hear about the opener there?  I could never say their name  But the guy got arrested for armed robbery  Coheed in Cambria 
[02:33:00]  Is that how you say it?  I always have a fucking  Yeah the bassist arrested for armed robbery  Before opening up for Soundgarden  Because he needed his oxys  Wow  Yeah  Yeah look at that picture  Look at Chris Cornell  I think it was in Mansfield  Like  Yeah  He looks like just an old fucking Satan  There's some old guy there  He's bald though  I think he's got a hat  The other guy is the bassist  The one guy looks like he should be in Haircut 100  Yeah  Right 
[02:33:30]  He's got a little  Chris Cornell's like  Hey look  I look like a different Soundgarden  He's the only one that looks like he belongs in the band  You're right  Cornell just  He looks on stage  He's the shit  He's flipping his hair  No one can flip their hair  Flip their hair like  Like Chris Cornell  The drummers had to cut his hair  Because it was fucking getting thinning  You know thin  You should cut it  You shouldn't keep it long anymore  It's pulling the hair out  They all look like they belong in different bands  I mean great band  That guy looks like he should be in some kind of blues band 
[02:34:00]  That looks like he should be in a new wave band  And the other one looks like he should be in maybe Dave Matthews band  Yeah  Or Duran Duran  Duran Duran  Duran Duran  Duran Duran  Look how great Cornell looks  Now he's got a beard  A full beard  It's fucking great  He's rocking the beard look now  He can do anything  Wait who has a full beard?  Chris  Cornell  Cornell  I wouldn't know  Why?  What happened?  My seats were so fucking far away I couldn't see shit  No way  And I got killed on Twitter for it  Did you see my seats?  No  Oh I had that stage pass 
[02:34:30]  The only problem I had with Soundgarden is my seats sucked  And it was pointed out many times by these lovely people on Twitter  But they didn't have the big fucking screens for people that had shitty seats like myself  Oh they had those where I was at  Not where I was at  No fucking big screens  I high-fived  Chris actually looked down at me  He was like  Bubby  And then he high-fived me  Bubby  Bubby  Bubby  What's your favorite Soundgarden song?  The Black Hole Sun  Really?  Gotta love The Black Hole Sun  Spoon Man  I go with the Spoon Man 
[02:35:00]  The Spoon Man  I like Rusty Cage  Rusty Cage rules  Can we play Johnny Cash right now please?  I know why  I like Soundgarden  But I like their version too  I prefer Cash's version  Give me a little Rusty Cage by Johnny Cash  That's not it  I'm not a big fan of the  I'm eating this  This is the first healthy thing I've eaten  The end of life hipster fucking Johnny Cash shit  Wow really?  Yeah just not a fan  You don't like this?  No  I'd rather hear the original  You wired me awake and hit me with a hand 
[02:35:30]  Broken nail  Oh this is Tom Petty's band  Oh really?  Yeah  You tied my lead and pulled my chain  To watch my blood begin to boil  How could you not like this?  Oh no  I'm gonna break  I'm gonna break my  Gonna break my Rusty Cage  And run  I'm gonna break  I'm gonna break my  Gonna break my Rusty Cage 
[02:36:00]  Nah I'm not feeling it  I just don't  Take that shirt off and see if it changes it  Maybe that's it  Dumb shirt I'm wearing  And Johnny Cash did the  Record the saddest song ever  His version of Hurt is  The saddest song ever  It's very good  It's a fucking great song  Did I  I don't know  But  Well  My sister who  You know  She's like a fucking  Like housewife in Florida  You know  Sure  And remember when 
[02:36:30]  Johnny Cash  Had that video of that song  Yeah  And that song is so sad to begin with  And the video  It all came together  Yeah  Well my sister was up  Because we were burying my uncle  Who died  At a very early age  Very tragically  Yes  And I was the dummy  That called my sister into the room  Because that video was on TV  I was like hey check this out  And that's all I was thinking  Like this is so cool  Like I was  I was out of the  The sad moment for a second  And I was like  Wow this Johnny Cash thing  She came in all excited 
[02:37:00]  Like oh a little distraction  Before we go to the wake  She bursted out crying  And ran out of the room  I'm such a dick  Yeah that probably wasn't  The good choice  But I wasn't thinking  Tell you you thought  It was a boy named Sue  Sorry  I wasn't thinking man  Is this the saddest  Girls just want to have fun  Or something  Yeah exactly  She thought it would be  Some kind of like nice  Something fun  Something upbeat  And a distraction  The video was really depressing  And great  It is the saddest song  I ever recorded  And unless someone  Could come up with  Something different  I challenge you today 
[02:37:30]  Because this thing  Is so fucking sad  Pause this  When they go to his museum  That was shut down  And there's cobwebs  On everything  That is a sad moment  I always thought it was sad  When they go to his wife  Because you knew she  By the time I saw this  You knew she was dead  When they show his grandmother  On the wall  Or his mother on the wall  Right  Miserable  And you can tell  He's at the end of his life  This is the saddest song ever  Wait what's the saddest  Come up with one  They closed his museum  Something by Anal Cunt  Huh 
[02:38:00]  They closed his museum  It's in the video  I know  But it's done  They were hoping  For the Elvis thing  And they didn't get  Quite the Elvis thing  With his museum  Wow  It's like me hoping  For the Dane thing  So they agreed  They allowed him  Go in there  And shoot  For this video  You haven't seen this  I've seen the video  But I don't remember  We'll get to the museum  Hit this thing  It's certainly better 
[02:38:30]  Than the Nine Inch Nails version  The Nine Inch Nails version  Is pretty cool too though  I like that  Yeah  That's his museum  Close to the public  Yeah  How old was he  When he dropped that  I love the fucking  Interlacing  Of the videos  This is ridiculously sad 
[02:39:00]  He was a man though  What a fucking man  Johnny Cash  I think he's  Performing this  In the museum  As a matter of fact  How is he  I think  Every guy wants  To be Johnny Cash  Showing the picture  Of his mom  Yeah  No  My empire  Of dirt  Very well directed  Video  I will let you down  Look 
[02:39:30]  Broken records  Yeah  That's a reference  To our show  In jail  I got him  Here's the museum shit  Yeah  That no one is looking at  Anyone  Stay the hell away  From me  You hear  I like that  You don't like that  You did  Yeah  It's so weird  Of thorns  He's got a messy table though  His episode of Columbo  Was pretty good  Remember that  Maybe that's where 
[02:40:00]  That was from  Was it  I don't know  It might have been  Did he have a stroke  Because his mouth  Is like  Yes  Before he did  And he's still able to sing  Before all these  New ones  He had a stroke  But that's why  He lisped a little bit  I love this old footage  Sorry I'm talking  About the whole song  But they show him  Going like  You know  The 60s  Anyone know  How old  They were  When he  Dropped that  75 maybe  Something like that  I'll go with  The 74 
[02:40:30]  Which is  Yeah  That's the bad age  You make it past 74  You'll make it  Way into your  Do you ever see  The footage  Of his last performance  It's miserable  Really  Yeah  That June Carter  Cash there  There she was  Oh he's pouring  Wine on the table  I would hate  To have to clean that  Yeah  My empire  Of dirt  I will let you down 
[02:41:00]  Is that some for his homies  Dumping some out  Yes  I will make you  The religious images  If I could start again  Yeah  Poor Johnny  Yeah  He had a good career  Oh yeah  Good life  Outlaw country rock star  Thing going  It's so beautifully put together  Like the tempo 
[02:41:30]  Of the music  And with the images  It's really well done  Although I will say  My favorite Johnny Cash video  Is probably either that  Or live  It's live footage  Ring of Fire  From the 60s  It's like two minutes  And there's a fucking guy  Playing  His  It's either a bassist  Or a guitarist  Is the fucking  Coolest guy  Ever  That was a dramatic feat  He puts down the piano thing  Whatever the fuck it's called  And then just kind of  Like brushes it  The keyboard cover  Yeah  I read an article on this 
[02:42:00]  And Trent Reznor  We've said it on our show before  But Trent Reznor  Was excited  He finally got to hear  What Johnny did with his song  They were so bummed out  By the version  They're like  Let's  They packed up for the day  So let's  We'll start  They liked it though  Right  They loved it  But they were so affected  By it  Oh really  They basically closed up  Shop for the afternoon  And said  That's great  We'll come back tomorrow  Wait no go back  Try to find the  The fucking 60's version  Of fucking  Ring of Fire  He's got  This guy playing  Guitar or bass 
[02:42:30]  Anthony will probably know  What kind of instrument it is  But his head is just  Guitar or bass  His head is just moving  And he's just the coolest guy  What's he doing?  His head is just  Moving  And he's all cool  Dude  Dude  It's like  He should  Hold on  Tell Sam if he doesn't find this  I'm gonna burn him  No that's not it  It's a black and  It's a black and white  Go back  I know it's not good for the radio  You just had it  Ring of Fire live  You just had it on the  The original page  That you had  Right at the sides  Sam  Not burning hips 
[02:43:00]  Sam stands on the computer  He really does  Ring of Fire from the 60's  Yes  But you're not finding it  You're just not  How about just put Ring of Fire  I have to go back to the original lineup  Not very good  This is not good  Danny never would have done this  Nope  Sneakers  I hate sneakers  Oh he's having a second  Yeah I think that's it  Fucking clown  It's a minute 34 seconds  But watch the guy  On Cash's left  Oh stand up  He's on the stand up base  Is that what that is  No  No no the other guy  Oh that guy  That guy yeah  Just watch his head  It's my favorite  And it makes 
[02:43:30]  A fiery rain  I just want to be that guy  The things that  You find amazing  Yeah  Crack me up  Yeah  I fell into a ring of fire  I fell into a ring of fire  That's interlacing  I fell into a burning ring of fire  I went down, down, down  And the flame of fire  Where's the guy's head?  This show  It's again  It's the show  He's just bobbing with the music 
[02:44:00]  The ring of fire  The ring of fire  Yeah  Look at that guy going  He loves it  Not moving a muscle  Just his little head  Going back and forth  I'm like what a cool  Motherfucker  It's so subtle  It's so good  Little head  He's not impressed at all  No  The fact there's a legend  Next to him  This could be my favorite  Johnny Cash song 
[02:44:30]  It's so simple  I think  What's your name  Write this  Or is that  Which one did June love?  Because he sang it  At the end  And he couldn't sing it  And he apologized  To the audience  And he couldn't sing  It was at his compound  Horrible  He died like two months  After her, right?  Yeah, it was pretty close  He couldn't go on without it  Hey, I didn't know  Sorry, that's Soundgarden's  Drummers now in Pearl Jam  I had no idea  Whatever  Oh, it's a new drummer  So that guy's a replacement  Bill Tetley  Bill Tetley, right?  Bill Tetley 
[02:45:00]  Bill Tetley is the new  Drummer for Soundgarden  You know the theme song  How does the theme song go?  B-I-L-L-T-E-T-L-E-Y  Bill Tetley  I fucking love that  Saddest song ever?  Got one in the running  Right here  Joe in Baltimore  Joe  Jungle Fever?  Yeah, Joe  This will give  Johnny Cash's version  Of her  A run for its money  Absolutely  Go ahead, sir  I'm going to  All right  Let's get into 
[02:45:30]  What we're talking about  Sometimes you've got to know  That you don't have to  Do all that shit  And just start talking  You guys are  You guys are  Easy fucking  Cocksuckers  Sometimes it makes sense  Other times it doesn't  It never makes sense anymore  Birthdays  We got it  All right  Hi, sir  Sorry  Go ahead, Joe  Hey, Warren Zeevon  Remember me  He recorded it  Just before he died  He knew he was dying  I hope he didn't do it after  He knew he was dying  And he comes out  With this fucking song  To make sure everyone  Remembers him  It's brutal  You ever hear this thing? 
[02:46:00]  Like  Chattos are falling  And I'm running out of breath  Man  Keep me in your heart  For a while  If I leave you  It doesn't mean  I love you any less  Keep me in your heart  For a while  When you get up  In the morning  And you see that crazy sun

I think so  Yeah  He got bumped  For some animal guy 
[02:47:00]  Ted the animal trainer  His animals went on duty  All over the stage  And Zeevon slipped  And couldn't perform  Sorry my goose  Went to the bathroom Dave  My goose is very nervous  He heard  Tuck Tuck  And he thought  You were going to  Hit him on the head  Oh  Fuck  What?  Why would the guy hang up?  He was going to tell you  Who that bass player  In the Johnny Cash video  Oh  Or the guitar  He's playing the steel guitar  I think right Ant?  It wasn't really

[02:51:30]  Yeah that's a good one  Brian wow  I can't say enough  About Breaking Bad  My girlfriend  Like she watched it  As it was playing  As it was on  Each season  And kept telling me  How good it was  I went out  Got all of the seasons  And by the first show  I don't know  Who figured this out  But the first show  Is so weird  The opening scene  Even that it's like  Alright now  Thank you 
[02:52:00]  I'm hooked on this  And couldn't stop watching it  It's designed that way  I mean the very first page  Of the pilot episode  That you're talking about  Says you know  A pair of trousers  Falling down  From the blue sky  White clouds  Red dirt  Hits the ground  An out of control  RV rolls over them  Inside  A man only wearing  Tidy whitey underwear  And a respirator  Drives frantically  Next to him  And I'm going  What what what what  Next to him  Is another man  With a respirator  Behind him  Two dead men  Sliding up and back  In a sea of chemicals 
[02:52:30]  In glass  And I'm  That was page one  And it was like  What  That's what gets you  Because you cannot  Turn that off  And go  I don't care  I don't care  What happens  Let's see what's  On reruns  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  It was  It just grabs you  And then the whole show  Just has this  Everything's kind of  Tied together  Which is weird  And I really didn't  Kind of get a grasp  On that until  I guess  Maybe the second season  That there's this  Cosmic thing going on  Where I guess 
[02:53:00]  You're the center of it  And was that put out  In the first season  Or they kind of  Think of that later  This  What Breaking Bad  Is attempting to do  Is to do something  That has never been done  In the history of television  And that is to start out  The series  With a guy  In one  Kind of person  He's a  In my case  I was a milk toast  High school chemistry teacher  Who is a good guy  Loves his wife  Has a couple kids  One special needs child  And is just trying  To make ends meet 
[02:53:30]  Just trying to get through  Life  And over the course  Of the series  That completely changes  Because of circumstances  That comes up  I.E.  Terminal lung cancer  He's got two years to live  What are you going to do  So he changes his entire life  Becomes a drug dealer  And by the end of this series  Whenever that's going to be  I will be this hardened guy  This hardened criminal  Yeah  I always  I kind of wonder  How it'll end  In that respect  Like will there be  Some kind of redemption 
[02:54:00]  Will you just be  A bad  Because I'm  As this is going along  From the first season  Till now  Like  You don't have problems  With killing people  You probably  Enjoy  Dealing the drugs  More than you would  Running a science class  Well it's  It's an interesting  Look  Sociological study  Really  Because you say  What are the influences  What are the indicators  That can change a man  What confluence  Of occurrences 
[02:54:30]  Has to happen  In order for  As our lead writer says  He wants to change the guy  From Mr. Chips  To Scarface  How do you do that  Yeah  You know  What are the circumstances  Yeah  Because it's not that  You're doing everything  At this point  Because I'm caught up  And I even  Managed to catch a couple  Of the  Season 4  Hello  One of the perks  One of the perks  And I gotta tell you  Amazing  Just amazing  From the  Because the way  Season 3 ended 
[02:55:00]  And then stepping into  Season 4 like that  It was perfect  Cool  But you start wondering  Like okay  This character  Did this for his family  Yeah  To start with  Yeah  But now you're enjoying this  There's a part of you  That doesn't want  Other people  It's like hey  You know  This is my dope  This is my stuff  Yeah  And you're proud of it  He takes a proprietary  Relationship to his dope  Yeah  And it's not just  Taking  Which was paramount  At the beginning 
[02:55:30]  Was taking care of your family  Right  Making sure they're okay  When you're gone  Nothing else  Other than that  Right  But now it's this thing  Where the character  Is turning into  A bad guy  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  Exactly  As planned  Like planned  Yeah  There is not going to be  Any redemption  To this man  He's going to go  He's going  It's in the title  Breaking Bad  We're going  It's going  All the way there  And the trick is  In that first episode  In the first season 
[02:56:00]  You plant the hook  In the audience  That they  At least  Relate to this guy  They either  Know him  I know a guy  Like that  You know  He's just trying  To make ends meet  Or that's me  I can relate to him  And then you hook him  And then as you  Start to allow  The changes  To happen  To this character  It's challenging  For the audience  To follow him along  And audiences  That we talk to  They love the show  And they say  Hey look man  You're really  Starting to 
[02:56:30]  Piss me off  Now  It's like  You're freaking me out  Because you're  And it's like  You're still on the ride  Because you're hooked  You're strapped in  There's no way out  It is a great strategy  Because if they just  Went right into it  As a drug dealer  You'd be like  Hey look  I've never done that  I can't relate to this guy  And why would I want  To watch this guy  Right  Kill people and make drugs  It's like  Yeah I don't know  I've seen it  I've seen it before  But this guy  Yeah regular Joe  He's married  He's working  And then gets cancer  And that's it 
[02:57:00]  And this  Our show asks that question  That everybody's played  Over dinner at some point  What would you do  If you had two years to live  Yeah  And what lengths  Would you go to  To make a million dollars  And everybody  When it stays  In that hypothetical  It's easy to take  The moral high ground  Oh no I would  But if it's really  Honestly  Presented in front of you  Yeah  What would you do  Can I answer that  Yeah man  I would kill my enemy  What  What if your enemy  Is  I got a million 
[02:57:30]  Kill my friends  No no no no  If I only had  If I only had  The two years  I would actually wait  Till I have about  Three months  And I got a short list  And I'm being honest  Short list  He wouldn't have to  Leave this building  Yeah  Fuck that  Morality shit  But how would you  Take care of your family  That's the  That's the big thing  You're already taken care of  Yeah but that's you  What if you were  You know  A high school teacher  Oh yeah well  I don't have the answer  To the million dollar thing  Yeah  I already got that  But  Elitist 
[02:58:00]  Yeah  Well  Like I don't understand  Like you know  Goldman hasn't  You know  Gone after OJ  Well he's not  He's probably waiting  But I think  These guys out there  When they do have  Terminal shit  He's made OJ's life  So miserable  OJ would be better off  Dead  Fucking Goldman  Got every dollar  In that civil suit  So believe me  OJ has been miserable  For 15 years  What does prevent people  From maybe  Going after some people  That did them really wrong  In their lives  If they know  They're not going to be around  Maybe there is that  Redemption thing 
[02:58:30]  In my day  It was Jack Ruby  Who killed Lee Harvey Oswald  He had terminal cancer  He was the guy  Who was sent in  Take him out  Yeah  You think there's more people  Like that out there  Yeah  I think so too  I think from playing this role  As Walter White  I've realized  That even the meekest person  Out there  Is dangerous  And capable  Of doing some  Real  Terrific damage  A great thing about the character too  Is taking that intellect  That would just be this  Nerdy geeky intellect  That obviously you've had  Being a chemistry teacher 
[02:59:00]  And using it  To outwit people  To save your own ass  A lot of times  Against people that should be  A lot smarter  In the drug industry  But you're seeing  Like how they're working  Pick up on it  Very quickly  How you got out  Of getting killed  By the giant  The washing machine  Thing  When they were going to  Take you downstairs  Oh yeah  Is genius  Is genius  It's like just  Blurt it out  And the guy goes  Like I don't want to  Spoil anything for people  But it's like  Oh my god 
[02:59:30]  Now they can kill him  It was fantastic  My concern is though  What if kids  Are affected by this  Negatively  I love this interview  Because I haven't  Seen the show yet  I saw the first two episodes  They gave me the box  It's fantastic  And I love the first two episodes  I can't wait to get the box set  And go through this now  It's fantastic  I understand that my co-star  Came here  Aaron Paul  Plays Jesse  Aaron  And there was the promotional  Discs that came  Yes  And he didn't see them yet  So he took them  Yeah  That putz head 
[03:00:00]  Bastard  Did he take it  Good thing I didn't bring mine in  How shitty are his connections  He's really got a place  I have so many people  Bill Burr was on the show too  Yeah  Bill Burr  Bill Burr had a part  Friend of ours  He was on  I was watching the season 4  A couple of DVDs  That they gave me  With a couple of episodes  And I was watching it  In my theater downstairs  So I  God you guys are so elitist  Oh we are elitist  Multi-millionaire  Total elitist  But I took a picture 
[03:00:30]  By the way  Who's the person doing  Your mani-pedi right now  Who's that  Yeah  Underneath the table  Yeah  Underneath the console  You gotta get the  My goodness  Yeah  We are very very elitist  So you saw it in your theater  I'm sorry  Yeah I saw it in there  Snapped a few pictures  You know no video  But just snapped a few pictures  And people were so jealous  They're like  You son of a bitch  I gotta see this  What happens  Like I'm not telling you  The show has become  As addictive as the drug itself  Yeah yeah  Crazy  The meth  The  Did you 
[03:01:00]  Now  Did you have to  I asked Aaron this  Did you have to  Kind of research  What people are like  When they're on that shit  Not so much  Because my character  Was the  I researched the chemistry  I followed the head  Of the chemistry department  At USC  Around for a couple days  And just learning  The nomenclature  And how  What does what  And this  Flask is for this  Titration  And that's for mixing  And this is for  You know  To get my head  Wrapped around that again  Yeah  But I didn't really want  To learn about 
[03:01:30]  The effects of the drug  Because my character  Is ignorant  Yeah you don't have to  Just doesn't  So I  You know  I learn  Along with my character  As we go  Do people ask you  Like chemical questions  Now in real life  You're like  I'm an actor  Idiot  It's a compliment  And you have won  Won some Emmys there  That's  Yeah I have  That's not  How many did you won  Three  That's great  You brought it up  To Aaron Paul 
[03:02:00]  Didn't you  Yeah  And I realized  That he  He indeed  Also has won an Emmy  He won an Emmy  But not as many  As you know  He won an Emmy  And all I said to him  Was like  So Brian won like  Three Emmys  For that  It's amazing  Like yeah thanks  You didn't acknowledge his Emmy  But you acknowledge Brian  In front of Aaron  He's got plenty of time  To act and stuff  You've been quite a few things  That's also nice to see  Brian too  I'm on my deathbed  No  I'm not  I'm not saying that  Aaron's got plenty of time left  You on the other hand  Get him while you can  It's your last shot 
[03:02:30]  You uh  I noticed with the  With this character too  There's an element of  Of the father  From Malcolm in the Middle  In there  Is he?  Yeah  But I think that's part of you  Like and I was asking  Is that like  You seem like a fun guy  No  But it doesn't  No you're miserable  Just a  Miserable bastard  You know  My character Hal  From Malcolm in the Middle  No he was  He was afraid of everything  This guy was  Just afraid of heights 
[03:03:00]  Of bugs  Of someone walking in the room  He didn't know  Yeah  So that was  That was him  But no  Hopefully there's not  Too much leakage  I think he's totally different  Shut up  I think he's totally different too  It's kind of a dick comment  Yeah it is  So you're the same guy  In every show  How do you pull that off  I think it's amazing  The difference between them  You're funny and Malcolm  You're hilarious  Shut up  There's a  And this is just so dramatic  It's unbelievable  There's a comic element  There's nothing similar  There's a comic element there  Oh my god  And the physical  That you can tell  Yeah  I'm just gonna  I'm gonna turn my attention 
[03:03:30]  Yeah  I'm totally right  Thank you very much  I can see the differences  Yeah  Gravity is making you turn  This fat bastard  Really turn on me  I have to  Yeah you have to  Anything  You have to  The rev of the blade of a sword  He was  Hilarious  That was a hilarious show  I mean really funny and edgy  Show  And now to do this  Is fucking crazy  That's like an actor's dream  To have a hit comedy  And then have a hit drama  Is there a question somewhere in there  Yeah and the critics love it man  No it was a statement stupid 
[03:04:00]  A long  A nice long  Just wait for the  Drawn out statement  Wait for the period at the end dummy  We're waiting  And of course  You know  Dr. Tim Watley  Being part of  An institution comedy  Like Seinfeld  That was just  That's great  That's crazy  That's gotta be one  That you're recognized  For a lot  I am still recognized  Because it plays so much  Yeah  A lot of the new generation  They don't even realize  That it hasn't been shot  In ten years  Yeah  You know  And it's just 
[03:04:30]  It was  It's an iconic show  Probably my most favorite comedy  Of all time  Yeah  I think a lot of people  Would say that  That is a good one  And one of the best  I think one of the best episodes  Is when you convert to Judaism  And will not stop at the Jewish jokes  Right  And Jerry goes to his  To my former priest  Yeah  And complains about it  And he says  And this offends you  As a Jewish person  No it offends me  As a comedian  As a comedian  Yeah  It's brilliant 
[03:05:00]  Yeah  Brilliant writing  Hilarious  That's where it all stems from  Yeah  Yeah  And no matter what it is  It's like this show  It's about the writing  Always  Of all the time  That is spent  Oh I thought you'd been  In our show  Oh yeah  Yeah  I haven't written a thing  In 17 years  You know  We're up at  When you guys  Take the time  To write that material  It's gold  It's gold  Terry  It's gold  It's gold  I'm a little out of this one  But that's fine  Yes sir  Are you really doing  Total Recall  The reboot  Yeah  That's fucking cool 
[03:05:30]  We're  I'm in the middle  Of shooting it now  Where I go back up  To Toronto  And about another  Who are you playing  I play Kohagan  Kohagan  Yeah  Ah Kohagan  That's exciting  That is good  Kohagan was a pretty good  Bad guy  Yeah  Who's playing Arnold's part  That's Colin Farrell  Really  Colin Farrell  Is playing the lead  Hauser  And Kate Beckinsale  And also Jessica Biel  Oh my god  Jessica Biel 
[03:06:00]  You want to smell  Where the poop comes out  Oh my god  Jesus  What  What  Who's it  I have a big star here  Hold on  It's that kind of writing  That's what  The lowest common denominator  That Total Recall  That's going to be  That's going to be great  The original  Very good  But to be able to do it now  And update a little bit  It's amazing  I like that  Welcome to the party Rick  Does Arnold make a cameo  Or anything  Or you don't want to talk  Not that I know of  Not anymore 
[03:06:30]  No I mean I haven't heard  Anything that he does  I think it's  I think he's  He plays the baby  He's a little radioactive  Right now  He's making a cameo  In his  He plays the baby  In the stomach  Oh  Quanto  Quanto  Quanto  Quanto  Oh that's cool  Is it sticking pretty much  To the story  No  It's  Actually  It's closer  More of the book  To the book  Than the movie  Than the movie was  Yeah  It's really cool though  And with the special effects  That they're doing  That's great  How many episodes  Of Falcon Crest 
[03:07:00]  For you  Oh my god  I don't know  You're digging back there  He has a great resume though man  It goes back to  This guy  What was your first show  Chips  Guys work  I think  Chips  Chips was the first  Nighttime show  It's an amazing  What did you do for Chips  What's that  I played  It was really bad  I played a guy  Who was talking like this  I like  Goldmer Pyle  And I was married to  A girl  Kathy Shower  Was her name  You can pop her up  Kathy Shower  I prefer Golden  We're going to lose our guest 
[03:07:30]  We're going to lose  It's a little too edgy  She was a playboy playmate  And Eric Estrada  Was all over her  And anyway  Kathy and I  Played this husband and wife  And we're from the south  Like this  And we're breaking the laws  It's just some ridiculous  Kind of thing  She's making erotic films now  Is she really  Sorry  How horrible  Is that her  How bad can it be  Is that her  It's just her ass 
[03:08:00]  That is showing  Very good Bobby  It's her with the flip cam  How terrible is that  You want to bang a girl  And Eric Estrada  Is trying to bang her  On his own show  It's like there's no way  Is that her  Yeah Eric's probably  Going to get her  I don't think you have a chance  No  Eric's probably going to get her  It's been a long time  I have no idea  What was the first thing you did  Sheesh  You know I did  I did some daytime  So I lived in New York  For five years  And did soap operas  Oh so you did some soaps  Yeah  And then went back to LA  And did all that stuff 
[03:08:30]  I met my wife on a TV show  Back in the 80s  Really  Yeah she was an actor  I was an actor  And we're  I'm doing the bad guy of the week  And she's the victim of the week  As the male female roles are  Especially back  Was it a manic show  It was a show called  Airwolf  Oh yeah  I don't remember  Airwolf  Of course  It was about a helicopter  Ernest Borgnine  And Jan Michael Vincent  Jan Michael  At his prime  Yeah yeah  Well just after his prime 
[03:09:00]  But I'll close  Poor guy  But he was talking about  Ernest Borgnine  At his prime  Oh so you were like  The bad guy in that one  Of course  Yeah  And they swooped down  And an airwolf  Yeah exactly  Fix your wagon  That kind of crap  Yeah yeah  Terrible show  Do you not really  Terrible  Terrible show  Well the whole  I think a lot of the 80s  Were full of some  Pretty crappy shows  Bad shows  Just as long as they  Because everything was  Produced by  God what's his name  Stu Siegel  Steven J. 
[03:09:30]  Stu Siegel  Stu Siegel Productions  I actually did a pilot for him  Called Adrenaline Run  You know the  How'd that work out  You know the  I'm here  You know the  Helicopters  Footage the news  Gets in LA  Because they always  Chase the cars  They would take  The real footage  And build a story  Around that  And we were  The Adrenaline Runners  I could make a whole  Feature out of this  Stuff footage  Frank Lupo  The creator of the  A-Team  And Hunter  Actually came up  With the show  The Adrenaline Runners  What would you guys do 
[03:10:00]  We would get in the car  And chase them  Because we were  On Adrenaline  Let's go  It's like  Fucking  It's like a twister  Oh with cars  Yeah we chased them  And then they cut in  The real footage  They'd have to  Duplicate  Shut down the highway  We had to do a chase  I had to slide over a hood  But this is the thing  Is the lead  You leave a nice crease in it  Yes  I had hair  And I was there  But I had a goatee  And the lead had a goatee  I was like one of the  Adrenaline Runners  The lead cop guy  Had a goatee 
[03:10:30]  So they make me  Cut mine off  And have a mustache  So I just look like  A fucking Mexican  With a mustache  One of the scenes  From Boogie Nights  Where they had to  Make one of the  Magnum PU  Speaking of the 80 shows  They're bringing back Dallas  Yes  Yeah  That hit the paper today  As a regular series  Or a  Larry Hagman  Is coming back  He's going to be part of it  So is Susan Gray  I think  And so is Patrick W  Isn't there a time  And a place  For certain shows  And things like that  To let it go  Yeah just  Let it go 
[03:11:00]  Let it go  Did you notice  That the kids on Malcolm  Were getting a little old  For what they were doing  Long in the tune  It's like  Hi dad  Wait a minute  What the fuck is there  It would be fun though  We'd love to come back  Years later  All the kids are grown  And see what happens  You know  What has happened  To that family  It would be fun  To do like a movie  Just a one off  Yeah  Just a one  I think that would be great  Yeah  Yeah  It would be fun to do  Hey getting back to Breaking Bad  Charlie Dog  I hope this doesn't  Give anything away  He says  Love the show  Please ask Brian 
[03:11:30]  How he got the pizza  On the roof  Does that make sense  Yeah  And how many takes  Did it take  That was hilarious  Okay this is the truth  It's a huge pizza  So huge  It was so heavy  And a real pizza  This box was the largest  Pizza box I've ever seen  And I'm trying to get  In good graces  With my ex-wife  And she won't have  Anything of it  And so I get pissed off  And I throw it up  On the roof  But I can't look like  I'm trying to throw it  On the roof  I'm just frustrated  And it lands on the roof 
[03:12:00]  And so I'm kind of  Feeling the heft of it  And the distance  And I tell the director  I said I need to be  About here  You know about  Six feet away or so  In order to justify  Getting it up there  So we  They have monofilament ready  They have all kinds of  Tricks they're ready to do  What's monofilament?  It's a little  Little thin wire  It's almost invisible  Nutrition wire  You can connect to it  And pull it  To help it out  I have some on me  Yeah  I'm wearing some  Of his underwear  Right now  That's going to hurt 
[03:12:30]  It hurts in a good way  So I said  I think I can do this  And so we  Did the scene  And then  Sure enough  I fling the pizza  It lands  Exactly in the spot  That would be optimum  For the camera  Yeah  On the roof  One take  That was it  And of course  The director says  Oh my god  Oh my god  That was fantastic  Okay let's try it again  No  And I said  Exactly  I said no  Trust me  It's not going to happen again  It's never happening again  That's it 
[03:13:00]  Let's walk away  The second you walked out that door  I went  That pizza is flying  Really?  I think everyone knew  Watching that going  That pizza's got to go  Because you're too pissed  Yeah  You're too pissed off  And some of the hiding places  For the money  I was a little like  That seems a little obvious  I don't know  Inside the  The vent  The heating vent  Yeah  This was new  You know  Having cash  That amount of cash  Is new to him  He's like 
[03:13:30]  I don't know what to do with this  I don't know where to go with it  And I was talking to somebody  About a show  That just has a lot of  Holy shit moments  Yeah  Where you do not expect  Like it's like  Wow  I thought that person  Would be around a little longer  Yeah  It's like  Whoa  Well  I guess that's the show  Have you seen the first  Couple episodes you said  Yeah  I've always seen the first  All of season four  Oh man  In the lab  Yeah  That is just brutal  It's fantastic  It's a  Yeah  Great scene  Just a  Fantastic show 
[03:14:00]  I could be happier  To have you here today  Thanks  What was your first acting role  That you actually booked  Like  You had probably gotten  A bunch of auditions  Gotten  No no no no  What was the first one  You actually  Landed for real  I think it  I think it was  Like Days of Our Lives  Or something  I had some kind of thing  And then  Turns out that I  I  I overslept  Oh shit  On my first day  And you're panicked  And I show up  And it was like  They were ready to recast it  And it was just a little role 
[03:14:30]  Anyway  And I was  I was just horrified  The entire day  I spent every dollar  Of my paycheck  Sending apology flowers  To the casting director  And the producer  And everybody  Yeah  Was that the time  Where Marlena  Was trying to be abducted  By  What's his name  By Stefano DiMera  Oh look at you  You  Oh did I watch that  Brian  Oh  We were doing  Afternoon radio  At the time  There's a story behind that  If you want to hear  And  It was  It was the one thing  To watch 
[03:15:00]  Before I went to work  Doing afternoons  And I got so roped into it  I  For years  I knew everything  That went on  On that god damn show  It's like  Oh boy  This is  You know  It's been three months  And Stefano's still  Stalking this woman  Yeah  Yeah  Now we've seen  The demise  Of that whole genre  Yeah  It's gone  It looks like  Some of them  Are just going to  Strictly internet  Some of them  Other ones are just gone  That was one of the  Highest paying gigs  In show business  At one point  Where  Cause you did that  Live TV every day 
[03:15:30]  How long ago was that  You just added  Just because you did  The show every day  You got paid  So much money  It seemed like  A rough gig too man  No reruns  But five days a week  You had to do  An hour show  That's brutal  Well I mean  It's not like  The highest acting  Quality either  It's just  Oh what are you saying  Where did you go  There we go  Now I get it  From this side  There you go  I mean  There you go  I meant  You were the last one  You liked to this  Am I the only one  Here who likes you  What's going on  With you guys  Thank you  I watched so 
[03:16:00]  I was in the hospital  For a month  Oh really  What were you kissing  My mom  Oh man  That's right  It was what she was kissing  That wasn't a problem  It's trying to be nice  No disrespect  No what the deal  On acting on daytime  It was  It's extremely difficult  Because it's  The quantity of work  Yeah  It's really challenging  To do really good work 
[03:16:30]  Because you just  You finish that day  And you basically  Throw that script away  And pick up a brand new script  And start reading  For tomorrow  And it's like  You're overwhelmed  With how much work there is  I guess when they're taping  You really don't have  A lot of time  To work out  A part  Or dialogue  With a certain person  It's like  Stand here  Say these lines  Okay  Turn here  Exit  Look angry  Cut  Print  Perfect  And if you get close  If the intention is correct  And you get all the names correct 
[03:17:00]  Then we're moving on  That's good  Now did you have to  Were you in the show  In the capacity  Where you got to be  One of the people  That had to  Kind of freeze frame  Their face  And make expressions  When they went to commercial  Everyone on Daytime  Has to do that  That's the hardest part  Because it's a big lie  So what were you doing  Last night with K  And then you got to just  And then just hold it  Hold it  Hold it  While they're fading out  That is hilarious  Or my deal  With my character 
[03:17:30]  And all the characters  Are pretty cut and dry  So my character  I was the associate professor  At the university  And I was a good guy  So I get dumped on  By girlfriends  And everybody's  You know  I'm a terrific guy  So I have this girlfriend  Who is dubious  And she's like  You know  She gets a phone call  And is obviously in shock  I mean obviously  And I'm going  Who was that?  And she goes  No one  And I go  Okay  And I go 
[03:18:00]  I can't do this  No you don't see me  And I go  Come on  It stinks  Looks like  She's just been  Disemboweled  And I go  Okay  And you're  And you're  Supposed to be  A professor  Jesus  Well I got to tell you  Brian actually  We're running out of time  I want to get the hell out of him  I got things to do  Brian you  I'm actually good for time  Why are you throwing Brian out?

[03:19:30]  On NBC  CBS  ABC  Or whatever  We don't want it  We don't want it  Get out of here  That's it  Hopefully we'll get a  Brian Cranston ass shot  Coming up on  I'll give it to you right now  What?
