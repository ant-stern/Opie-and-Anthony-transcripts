<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a fiery discussion of their "fuck-o list" of disliked radio personalities and the awarding of "golden tickets" to those they admired.  They lambasted commercial radio, praising satellite radio (XM) for its freedom.  The hosts detailed the firing of Cowhead and Brent from a Tampa station for supporting O&A, playing audio of pest callers offering them encouragement.  A significant portion focused on a feud with Dallas radio host Russ Martin, whom they accused of avoiding them and having limited reach despite local success; a recorded, contentious phone call with Martin was played. The hosts also complained about their production staff's coffee and club soda failings and made insensitive jokes about the death of Peter Jennings and Dana Reeve's cancer diagnosis, launching into a discussion about the negative effects of medical dramas.  Listeners called in with their opinions on the feud and satellite radio.  Ron and Fez, and later Bob Saget, were announced as upcoming guests.  A humorous anecdote about Opie outside a Hollywood premiere was teased. The show included a prolonged humorous segment involving an 80-year-old Italian mother calling mission control about her astronaut son.

The show continued with Opie expressing his dislike for medical shows, contrasting "Emergency!" and "Quincy," describing the latter as having a "homoerotic relationship" between its characters.  They then toasted Dana Reeve.  A live commentary of the Space Shuttle Discovery's landing followed, interspersed with crude asides.  A caller, Matt, recounted a failed joke attempt on the Howard Stern Show.  A bizarre, sexually charged running gag about a fictional "Charlie" and his mother emerged. Opie then shared a story about meeting Colin Powell.  Opie detailed an unexpected paparazzi encounter at a movie premiere, discussing his surprise at being recognized and the subsequent frenzy. This led to a discussion about the show's perceived "garbage" status and the fear it inspired. Opie recounted celebrity encounters, including a flight with Bob Saget and the Sugar Hill Gang, highlighting an unpleasant encounter with Wonder Mike.  Ron and Fez arrived in studio.  The conversation covered their past shows, agent Bob, experiences with Infinity Broadcasting, and humorous past radio stunts, including one involving an enema and a dominatrix.

With Ron and Fez in studio, the conversation jumped between topics. A prank involving a blindfolded, intoxicated person kissing a man was recounted.  They discussed past radio experiences, shocking stunts (like a nipple piercing), their firing, a "bitch slap contest" controversy resulting in a fine from Eliot Spitzer, and their upcoming move to SiriusXM.  Anecdotes about their time off were shared.  The hosts discussed an unflattering publicity photo. Bob Saget unexpectedly joined them, leading to discussions of a bizarre plane ride with unsettling encounters and a flight attendant's requests.  The conversation moved to Saget's career, *Full House*, *The Aristocrats*, and stand-up comedy.  Crude language, sexually suggestive humor, and discussions of controversial topics continued.  Listener calls were interspersed.

Bob Saget's segment was highly vulgar and sexually explicit. Topics included Saget's comedic style, his relationship with the Olsen twins, a graphic recounting of his daughter's traumatic birth (including a possibly fabricated anecdote),  a detailed discussion of *The Aristocrats*, and his career.  Extended discussions about shock humor, taste, and celebrity culture occurred.  Callers expressed mixed reactions to Saget, with one sharing a story about his high school years.  A song, "Rolling with Saget," (with clean and dirty versions) was played, along with an extremely graphic version of the *Aristocrats* joke attributed to Eric Cartman.

The show continued with Ron and Fez, beginning with a rambling, profanity-laden anecdote about a fictional encounter with Bob Saget.  They discussed a Daily News article about their firing from WNEW and their "golden ticket" giveaway.  The conversation shifted to Earl, a lazy but resilient former WNEW employee. A song parody about Earl, "Black Girl," was played.  Listener calls, including one from "Photoshop Mike," continued.  A paparazzi photo of Opie and his girlfriend was discussed.  The segment concluded with promotional spots, further discussion about Ron and Fez's return, and more listener calls, including one suggesting Christopher Reeve's ass-wiping as a possible cancer cause.

[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We're going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with Down Syndrome children.  No, baby.  That's terrible.  We will be in the end of the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be in the end of the show.  We'll be in the end of the show. 
[00:04:30]  We'll be in the end of the show.  We'll be in the end of the show. 
[00:05:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program, giving props to our boys, Ron and Fez, who will be joining us this morning. 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  Very early for them, I would think, right?  They used to do mornings back in the day, right?  Yeah, but you know, you kind of get used to that lifestyle of sleeping a little late.  We gave out our first golden ticket to Ron and Fez, and they're stopping by today to say hi and do the show with us today.  See their little sign outside the door?  Yeah.  Got their, like, dopey pictures.  Remember when they took our dopey pictures, and we were in the studio, and they put Opie and Anthony, XM, yeah.  High voltage, and they got a little date down there, August 9th, and whatever it is. 
[00:06:00]  And they look as comfortable in the pictures as we did.  Oh, shit.  We're going to do what's called...  Would you sit next to each other?  We're going to do what's called an Afro show today.  Yes.  Turn this up a little bit.  This is Ron and Fez's intro music, mixed in with our intro music.  Got to thank Drew Boogie for throwing this together.  Of course, Drew Boogie.  Get your ass off the way, church, here we come, and we spring a mix, and come into your side. 
[00:06:30]  We got three shows, three shows, right now.  People don't like these honesties.  For people, what's love to have a shot at these.  If you're thinking too good for a night show, please, let me know.  And I'm a whip back and see.  Come on.  Afro.  Ah, you just feel the excitement, don't you, Anthony?  Yes.  Absolutely.  As we rebuild our radio careers and we bring other people along with us for the ride.  Getting the band back together, man. 
[00:07:00]  We did get the band back together.  Ron and Fez, true friends of ours.  Absolutely.  We have a few more golden tickets to give away to other shows out there.  Yes.  And all the other shows that know they're not getting a golden ticket, they're just bitter,  suck assholes.  They're trying to spin it to make themselves look good.  If you're trashing satellite radio at this point on your commercial radio show, you're 
[00:07:30]  really just a douchebag.  You're just a fucko, and that's why you should be on the fucko list.  Fucko list.  Absolutely.  Satellite radio is taking off.  It's exploding right in front of our eyes.  You don't see it?  You're silly.  And unlike Howard Stern, we're going to hire radio shows for 202 and other channels on  XM Satellite Radio that we're not scared of.  Yeah.  Yeah, he likes putting shows on there that won't, I don't know, won't get any real attention, 
[00:08:00]  take any attention away from him.  That's what he does now.  Yeah, I wanted that music.  That was really good.  Where is...  All of a sudden, the energy just sucked out of the room and stuff.  Where's Harry?  You didn't get your food yet?  No, I got my food, which was just a stupid bagel, because that's the only thing we can  get from the savages that work here in New York City.  The only thing I could sometimes get right is a piece of cooked dough.  That's pretty much anything more complex than that, and it's going to be screwed up on a  pretty consistent basis. 
[00:08:30]  But Harry seems to have forgotten my club soda.  Now, I know it's not like I get a bottle of club soda every fucking morning, but...  You know, and it's not like a broadcaster really does need something to drink during  the show.  But, ah, whatever.  Boy, are they dropping the ball.  It's time to start racking some intern head around here.  We got the good ones on board, threw them some money, now they're sitting here, and the 
[00:09:00]  rest of them, a crop of shit.  If I may say that.  Is this like, uh, deja vu?  All over again.  I think there's a deja vu thing happening here.  I just...  Could I have a club soda, please?  Deja vu.  I was in the middle of a nice rap about the fuck-o list and golden tickets, and we go  right back to the stupid...  That's how the show works.  ...food thing again.  Yeah.  The show starts with the food thing every fucking morning.  Is it every morning? 
[00:09:30]  Every morning.  The bagel's not right.  The coffee order's wrong.  Where's this?  Where's that?  Where's my club soda?  I guess if we all brought in our little cereal and blueberries, the world would be a perfect  place.  Oh, yeah.  I gave up on everyone about ten months ago.  Yeah.  See, if you do it yourself, you know it's going to be done right.  That's true.  My dad taught me that lesson many years ago.  Mmm.  So I come in with my oatmeal prepared, with my raisins on the side, and a bag of blueberries, 
[00:10:00]  and a yogurt, and a banana.  I'm set for the morning.  You're right.  And all I need is a stupid cup of coffee every morning.  And that is actually wrong every morning.  So I'm going to start getting my own coffee as well on the way in.  Just brew it yourself.  I want to.  Well, we asked for the Starbucks machine.  Yeah.  God forbid Starbucks gives us a free machine like they did the gang in Washington.  Yeah.  I mean, we talk about Starbucks every morning.  I mean, come on.  Why don't you help us out a little bit?  Give us a machine.  All right.  We've got to get right into the show. 
[00:10:30]  There's so much going on.  Steve in Tampa.  What's up, Steve?  Hey.  I just wanted to let you guys know, man, besides been listening to your show now for about a  year, but they took Kyle and Brent off and put on that stupid Bandito music on that  radio station.  Oh, yeah.  A little update.  We've got a lot of new listeners every single day here on XM, but basically, how do we explain  Cowhead and Brent, Anthony?  Well, they're a show.  They were on an infinity station.  Where?  Down there in Florida?  Tampa?  Yeah.  In Tampa.  And they're pretty cool guys.  Yeah.  They called up begging, and so freaking, you know, I wanted to at least give them props. 
[00:11:00]  They were pretty good while they were there.  Well, the whole radio industry taking off on this whole golden ticket thing.  They know these golden tickets are very valuable, and some shows step it up and realize, and  you know, maybe they should call the program and try to get a golden ticket.  Uh-huh.  And Cowhead and Brent were the first radio show brave enough to do that during their own  morning show in Tampa.  We hooked up for about a half hour of great radio, and Cowhead and Brent were hinting that  they were going to get fired by the end of the week because they were bringing in some  Spanish programming.  And they assumed, yeah, the whole station was going to flip to Spanish, and I guess that's 
[00:11:30]  what happened, huh, Steve?  Oh, yeah.  That's definitely what happened.  They're playing that bandito music.  I can't understand the freaking word of it, but, you know, hey, that's what happened.  And they threw Cowhead and Brent out.  Yeah, they're definitely fired.  Mm-hmm.  They got fired, which is too bad because they're really, really a good young show.  They knew it was coming, though, and they kind of had a little farewell on their show,  which was pretty cool.  Didn't they, like, bring goats in or something to lobby of the station?  Yeah, that's what I heard.  They said it didn't make good radio, but it pissed off a lot of people, and that's pretty 
[00:12:00]  good if you're getting fired.  Yeah, they did so.  To piss off the superiors.  All right.  I'm watching out, guys, man.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Well, we had so much fun with those guys, we decided to have an attack on their radio  show.  Yeah, but it was a good-spirited, fun attack.  Well, we do friendly fire every once in a while, friendly fire.  And we got some audio of the pests attacking the Cowhead and Brent Show.  Listen to this.  Cowhead and Brent Show, hello.  How we doing?  Good, sir.  How are you? 
[00:12:30]  Not bad.  It's Cowhead in.  This is Cowhead.  You're live on the air, sir.  Well, good.  Calling from Salt Lake City.  Just heard you on the O&A.  My vote is you get the golden ticket.  Well, I hope so, sir.  I appreciate the call, man.  You have no idea how hard we need this.  Yeah.  Be cool.  You be cool, too.  Thanks.  Cowhead and Brent Show, hello.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, I just heard you on XM there.  You guys rock.  Well, thank you, sir.  We're trying.  You guys are awesome.  Hey, today's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  I'm driving down I-75. 
[00:13:00]  I just want all the young ladies to know that I am hopeless this morning.  I got my nuts hanging out right now while I'm talking to you, sir.  Nice.  Thank you.  Good morning.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah, you're live on the air.  Hey, it's a big-ass member from WackTag.  What's up, dude?  I just want to say, I heard you guys on XM.  You guys sound great.  Hope you guys get a golden ticket.  Can I tell you something about WackTag?  What's that?  This is what, getting calls from the WackTag guys saying that we did a good job is like  better than Opie and Anthony saying it because the WackTag guys are so effing brutal with  everything that they call the show and call Opie and Anthony out on that thing, so I appreciate 
[00:13:30]  it, man.  Thanks, brother.  Cowhead and Brent Show, hello.  Is this me?  Yeah, it's you, sir.  Hey, Joey DVDs from WackTag.com.  What's up, Joey?  I got to agree with big-ass member.  You're absolutely right, man.  If you guys get a call from the Pest saying you guys did good, you're in.  That's right.  We're all hoping you guys get a golden ticket.  You guys got a great show down there.  My one reservation about calling Opie and Anthony was that I was going to get tortured  from WackTag people for the rest of the day.  You know what?  You might get tortured, but it's going to be good because the guys said you guys did a  good job, and we all agree.  All right.  Opie and Anthony on XM202. 
[00:14:00]  We're hoping you guys get on there, too.  Appreciate it, man.  Thank you.  Looking forward to it, man.  Thanks.  Cowhead and Brent Show, you're live on the air.  O&A Party Rock!  O&A Party Rock!  So after they called our show, they had to deal with our Pest calling their show and giving  them props and just messing with them a little bit.  Yeah, they were pretty cool with them.  And then I guess at the end of the week, they ended their show with this, knowing they  were going to get fired.  You guys have been great.  The best audience we ever had.  Appreciate all the support.  Check out cowheadandrent.com. 
[00:14:30]  We'll keep you updated.  Plus, we're going to add new stuff.  Basically, there's just pictures on there, but we'll be adding new poop up there pretty  soon.  Have a great weekend and a great rest of your lives.  Infinity can nestle up to my left nuts.  And your mom's box.  Gotta love the props by using your mom's box.  The sign-off.  The sign-off is really taking on a life of its own.  I love when other shows use that.  It's great.  It's this camaraderie. 
[00:15:00]  Your mom's box is great.  Once again, for the new listeners, it's something we started many, many years ago when one of  our guys got fired for having a couple have sex on the boss's couch.  His fine Italian leather sofa.  Yes.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  His couple had anal sex on the boss's couch during one of our Sex for Sam contests.  And he got fired.  And we asked him for his last words.  And it was your mom's box.  And ever since everyone associated with the show, knowing it's their last time on the 
[00:15:30]  air, pretty much say your mom's box.  Tribute.  So, Cowhead and Brent, they got fired.  And I went to Cowhead's website this morning.  And it says, a note from Cowhead.  Hello, kids.  As of 6-something p.m. on August 8th, Outlaw 92.5 has switched to La Nueva 92.5.  Si.  I don't speak Spanish, but if I have to guess, La Nueva means lying, backstabbing motherfuckers.  I really like this Cowhead guy, man. 
[00:16:00]  I gotta tell you.  Don't know much about him, but we're gonna try to find out all we can about Cowhead.  I know of no radio broadcaster that was not retiring that knew his last show was coming  ahead of time.  I got real lucky last week.  I do not regret this last week of shows.  As usual, I spoke the truth.  And instead of you folks having to wonder what happened to us when you heard Spanish on  Monday, you most likely said, that fucker was right.  In my 12 years of doing this, Outlaw listeners were the best of any show.  You guys caught on quick, fucked with us, fucked with each other, used your nicknames and gave 
[00:16:30]  yourselves names when I didn't.  Your calls were great, and I will miss hearing from guys like Spicoli, G-Man, Manchula, Kettle  Corn Man, Ozzy, and Keith Urban, Sling Blade, How You's Doing, Brooklyn Mike, Pseudo Brooklyn  Mike, Team Owner's Wife.  That is Brooklyn Mike and Pseudo Brooklyn Mike.  How do you know, guy, and the rest of you?  You are all awesome.  Thank you to Lewis and Red of the Dallas Bull and to Bob Murray of Auto Way Ford. 
[00:17:00]  These are some of the most loyal men I've ever met, even now that he is not paying me.  I promise you, Bob Murray is one of the only stand-up guys I have ever met in the car business.  Please keep checking back here for updates.  Thanks to Moose for keeping us up.  We hope to have some news soon.  For you XM owners, listen to Opie and Anthony.  Very cool.  Very nice.  Someone wants to bust my balls in Jackson.  Ben, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to ask you, you know, you guys are always railing on Stern for everything, 
[00:17:30]  but, you know, you guys keep wanting the other radio stations to kiss your ass,  and you keep complaining about everybody copying your show.  It kind of sounds like the same shtick.  We don't want other shows kissing our ass, first of all.  Well, it certainly comes across that way.  Not really.  We don't want other shows kissing our ass.  I started a whole fuck-o list, idiot.  We don't like other shows, a lot of them.  If they're funny and good, then we kind of like the show.  There's a handful of shows we like out there, and the rest of them could go fuck themselves. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  That's why we started this whole fuck-o list and a list of potential shows we might bring  to XM Satellite Radio.  Well, I'll tell you the good news.  I've been listening to you guys for a few months now, and I've definitely gotten into  the rhythm of things.  I've been an XM subscriber for a few years now and had planned to switch over to the other  one in January, but now I think I'm going to stay put.  Thank you, sir.  Well, thank you.  Speaking of shows we hate, Russ Martin, I guess, responded to us because we threw him 
[00:18:30]  on the fuck-o list.  Oh, we did?  This Russ Martin guy is a clown.  Another one-market sensation.  Does great in Dallas.  You know, we'll give him props where props are due.  Does great, but he's a one-market sensation.  Where is he?  Dallas.  He was on the same station we were syndicated to.  Oh.  And wouldn't know that.  The only reason I know that is because when we got fired, I went down there, and when  Jimmy was touring, and Jimmy would do some radio with Pugs and Kelly, and this guy was 
[00:19:00]  scared to meet us, which was the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life.  The weirdest fucking thing.  Really?  Yeah, he acts like his shit don't stink.  He pretty much broadcasts from a dark studio, kind of like Likus.  Like Likus, right.  A tough guy.  No one's allowed to talk to him, and he wears his sunglasses indoors, and, you know.  In Dallas, he's huge.  I'm not going to lie to you.  He's huge, but as far as getting syndicated, he's a one-market sensation.  The business is filled with these guys, and they're all cocky, and they're a little city, 
[00:19:30]  but when it comes to the rest of the country, no one even knows their names.  Yeah.  Yeah, why don't you try syndicating to a few major markets first, before you start mouthing  off?  So we added him to the fuck-o list.  Why don't you be successful in a few other cities?  In a few major markets.  I love when people start talking about the Opie and Anthony show and how we're on satellite  radio, and they alter history when they say things about how we were thrown off, couldn't  stay on regular radio.  The reason we're on satellite is because we were unsuccessful. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, we're a show that was proven in major markets around the country.  Go ahead.  Did you do that?  He's a big guy down there in Dallas, huh?  Is that what he is?  Yeah.  A big guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  One market.  Ass.  And he sounds exactly like Howard.  Exactly.  Really?  Exactly.  That's what that is.  Party bus and helicopter.  Yeah.  What a nice neighbor.  All right.  Let me take this.  What is it, Bill?  Speaking of satellite, Opie and Anthony had some very harsh words to you today, Russ. 
[00:20:30]  What did they say?  They put you on...  Okay.  First of all, Russ Martin knows exactly what we said.  Of course.  That's why he took this call to set up his little rant that he's about to do.  That's how they work on radio.  What do they say?  What do they say?  Oh, believe me.  Wow, this is a big surprise.  What did they say?  He probably heard it live.  All radio guys have XM.  All the listeners on Instant Feedback are putting the last caller, Ben, on the fuck-o list. 
[00:21:00]  The listeners have their own fuck-o list for the other listeners.  I love it.  So here's Russ Martin.  What did they say?  This is your day, Russ.  What did they say?  They put you on a list that began with the letter F and ended with the letter O.  And they also said, screw him.  And they said that when they visited Dallas, that you would not say hi to them. 
[00:21:30]  I never saw them.  Nothing at all.  Also, they said that...  I love the little fucking tattletales.  What a tattletale.  And they said, and then they said, and they said.  The little rat.  Full family of fucking rats.  By the way, we're hearing this for the first time, because I want to have a natural reaction.  And if you don't believe me, I could get Steve and everyone in here.  I have no idea what he's going to say. 
[00:22:00]  But I got to tell you, we made it a side thing that, you know, the guy wasn't even willing to say hi to us.  It didn't wreck our day.  Trust me.  It was just one of those things that was like, it was pretty strange that he was kind of hiding from Jimmy and I when we were down there.  Yeah.  That was obvious.  The whole staff was coming up and saying hi, especially to Jimmy, because he was, you know, doing the Pugs and Kelly show.  And a bunch of other people, salespeople, blah, blah, blah.  We were pretty successful for that station in Dallas when we were syndicated.  And he went out of his way to make sure he didn't run into us.  That's all I'm saying. 
[00:22:30]  Because I'm sure he's going to say something stupid here.  I never saw him.  Nothing at all.  Also, they said that you were destined to be, to suffer stuck in terrestrial radio.  Radio.  Excuse me.  Terrestrial.  Oh, I get it.  I get it.  Yeah.  Non-satellite.  Yeah.  That's why they probably have 8,000 or 9,000 subscribers.  And I got...  That gag again. 
[00:23:00]  I get it.  Shut the fuck up.  8,000 or 9,000.  I love the numbers they pull out of their assholes.  8,000 or 9,000 listeners.  Are we up to that?  That's amazing, isn't it?  I'm happy.  Let me tell you something.  This is the deal with our program.  Like, they have to...  They're going to renew our contract on a yearly basis, basically.  That's how bad we fucked up with this Sex for Sam thing.  We're up to 10 months.  They have picked up, you know, next year, obviously. 
[00:23:30]  Okay?  If we only had 8,000 or 9,000 listeners, the amount of money they're paying us, they would  have got rid of us.  Trust me.  Gone.  We would have been so gone.  So fired.  Not just fired.  We would have been so fired.  So fired.  Russ Dick Martin.  8,000 or 9,000 subscribers, and I got 500,000.  You're right.  I'm asked.  I'm on that F-O list.  He just admitted he only has 500,000 listeners?  Oh, man.  Honestly, I wasn't paying attention. 
[00:24:00]  He really said he only has half a million listeners?  What an idiot.  Proving that he's just a one-market sensation.  He was bragging about 500,000 listeners.  Trust me.  We have over 500,000 listeners on XM Satellite Radio already.  I'll absolutely say that.  Way more than 500,000.  This guy just proved our point.  On XM Satellite.  Yeah.  That's why they probably have 8,000 or 9,000 subscribers, and I got 500,000.  You're right.  I'm asked.  I'm on that F-O list. 
[00:24:30]  Right after they put them on from 7 to midnight here, I got an email.  I told you guys about that.  Okay.  This is the biggest bullshit.  I know what he's going to say on this thing.  This thing is amazing.  Oh, I remember this.  The general manager emails me one day, and he goes,  why are you sending evil or negative emails to Russ Martin?  Russ Martin claimed, this guy is so paranoid, I swear to you, 
[00:25:00]  I think he set this up himself.  I can't prove it.  Yeah.  But the general manager emailed me and said,  why are you sending Russ Martin emails like this?  And basically it said something like, hey, dickhead, you're next.  We're coming to get your job.  Like we weren't satisfied with the slot we were in.  And it was sent by you?  Sent by me from my email account, supposedly, to Russ Martin's email account.  Okay.  The general manager calls me on it.  I go, dude, sorry, didn't do it.  I don't have time in my life to worry about stupid Russ Martin. 
[00:25:30]  At that point, we were being syndicated to 20 cities across America.  I wasn't really concerned about, you know, Russ Martin in Dallas.  Yeah.  The general manager doesn't believe me.  I got Ken Stevens involved and the entire company.  I got Scott Colombo involved.  He was the tech guy, the computer guy.  And he checked out my computer and what, the IP or whatever?  Yeah.  And it was proven that this email that they're talking about, what he's about to talk about,  I never sent. 
[00:26:00]  I just don't do things like that.  You know that, Andy.  That isn't how we operate.  You know our MO when we want to rip somebody apart.  It's not sending a stupid email.  The general manager never believed me.  Ken Stevens had to get on the phone with him.  Sending about 20,000 emails from you pests.  That's how it's done.  The general manager and the program director, both, that's right, didn't believe me.  Nice.  Nice guys down there.  And we went and we had a whole internal investigation.  The whole company got, not the whole company, but a lot of the tech guys in the company got 
[00:26:30]  involved and they proved without a doubt that this email didn't come from New York.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  From 7 to midnight here?  Yeah.  I got an email.  I told you guys about this.  Go ahead.  It said, sender not specified.  Oh, yes.  Okay.  I know what you're talking about.  I opened it up and it said, we're coming after your shift next.  So I opened it up, looked at the properties, and it was like opiate, opening anything.com.  Nice job covering that up. 
[00:27:00]  I hate these fucking guys.  We say it on a weekly basis.  They're a bunch of fucking liars.  Lying hacks.  Lying hacks.  He knows damn well, as he's saying this probably last week on our show, that it was proven that  I did not send this email.  It was proven.  Yeah.  When is this guy on?  Between his tech guy and our tech guy, the whole deal.  Because I'm like, no fucking way, dude.  When is this guy on, by the way?  Three to seven.  Three to seven?  Dallas.  Hey, go to it, fellas.  Attack. 
[00:27:30]  Attack.  Have fun with it.  Attack.  Attack.  Have fun with Russ Martin, this douchebag.  Properties.  It was like opiate, opening anything.com.  And here's the left.  I got to cover that up.  I got to cover that up.  Nice job covering that up.  Small detail.  How did that six for Sam thing work out for you?  Well, it worked out great for us, Russ.  We got the boots, spent two years getting paid, hanging out, and then we got a job here 
[00:28:00]  at XM Satellite Radio where we can do whatever we want.  How's it working for you?  It worked out just fine.  I spent two years playing golf, following my comedian buddies around America.  I was just wandering the earth.  It was great.  How'd that work?  How'd that work out?  Mm-hmm.  How'd that six for Sam thing work out for you?  No.  You're out of work for a while.  Now you're on Satellite.  Now, if Satellite had been on for a while, and there were a lot of big-name talent there, 
[00:28:30]  then I'd say, you know what, you may be a step ahead of me.  Yeah.  But right now, you're floating on the load boat.  Yes.  Yeah, if it had been around, because here's another coward, here's another coward that  doesn't have enough faith in his own talent to be a pioneer in some industry.  The guy was, he just said it.  If it had been around a while, and it was full of hacks like myself, ah, then I'd dip 
[00:29:00]  right in.  I love the guys on regular radio that just talk about Satellite like that.  I love it, because it's just going to bite you in the ass.  People are fleeing regular radio on a daily basis.  The second you get Satellite, the second you get it, you do not go back to regular radio.  And it's ended up in all the cars, and if you think people are going to sit through your  fucking commercials and your babble for hours on end, it ain't going to happen. 
[00:29:30]  Look at HBO now.  Look at the shows on HBO.  They do great.  They're entertaining, real life.  Things you can't get on network.  And network television, they're struggling.  And they were the ones saying, well, cable, who's really watching that?  You sound the same.  You sound exactly the same as those idiots with no foresight.  That's really the only way that they got a chance to get exposure is to bag on people  on terrestrial radio.  Correct.  Hopefully, you'll talk about it. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  Otherwise, nobody knows where they are.  Nobody knows where they went.  How's anybody going to know where they went unless you have people on terrestrial radio  talking about them?  Disgusting.  Yeah.  So that's a dandy list.  In fact, that's exactly why they come up with some kind of list.  Sure.  We'll put all these guys that are on the air, the people here, we'll put all of them on  a list.  I guess the guy listens to us a lot.  No, you really stink is what it is.  It's like, why does it have to be a gimmick?  Why can't you just fucking suck and we point it out? 
[00:30:30]  Why does it have to be a gimmick to publicize our show?  You stink.  You're on the fuck-o list.  That's why we talk about you.  We could give a shit if you mentioned our show, our names, or anything.  And I so mean that.  I absolutely mean that.  Because people are finding out we're on satellite radio.  Yeah, believe me.  We're doing just fine here.  The latest is, you know, a nice huge interview in Penthouse Magazine.  We have the assault on the media that we do.  It gets our name out there.  We're in the papers. 
[00:31:00]  We don't need the likes of you saying our name to get our names out there.  We're doing just fine on our own.  We're doing fine.  Please don't mix this up.  The reason you're on the fuck-o list is because you're a fuck-o.  You suck.  You're a phony.  And we're pointing out the phony ass-wipes in radio.  And he sounds just like Jim Phillips, who sounds just like Lexi Terry.  Oh, they got that voice.  Listen to him.  He's all smarmy and just, yeah, satellite. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Who sounds like Todd Schnitt, who sounds like Shannon Burke.  Oh, they're hashy fake radio voices.  Enough.  You're a bunch of phonies.  The air.  The people here.  We'll put all of them on a list.  They'll talk about us.  Gavin here.  He's coming in.  Is there a mic out there?  Yeah.  Which one?  All right.  Gavin just came in. 
[00:32:00]  We had a surprise for him in the hallway.  A lot of dead air.  I don't know if this is the best one we pulled on him, but it's close.  I think so.  And it's certainly not bad for a terrestrial bit.  No, sir.  Oh, that's where he was going.  Never work in satellite.  Holy crap.  Never work in satellite.  An absolute bore fest. 
[00:32:30]  No honesty.  A hack.  A liar.  Another radio guy that's just a flat-out liar.  Have fun.  Oh, God.  Russ Martin, you are on the fucker list, my friend.  You are a real douchebag.  Dan in Connecticut, what's up?  Hi.  Opie.  They're going to release the number.  You need his number.  You want to give him a phone call?  Yeah.  He's probably going to be another pussy that doesn't go with it, but his phone number is 
[00:33:00]  214-787-1053 for the Russ Martin program.  It's on KLLI-FM.  That's 105.3 FM.  I love these.  The same station that has Pugs and Kelly, and we like Pugs and Kelly a lot.  They can't stand Russ Martin, by the way.  Russ Martin.  Oh, it's true.  They openly say it on their show.  This guy is such a douchebag. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  One of those typical radio ass wives.  He thinks his shit don't stink.  The fact is, he's a one-market sensation.  That's great.  Have fun with the pests today.  We will take care of it.  Russ at russmartin.com.  He's on from 3 to 7.  But that's like Dallas time.  They're all fucked up down there, aren't they?  It's 12 to 4, I guess.  No, don't say that.  You're not three hours behind us, mister.  I think they're an hour behind us.  I don't know.  You guys figure it out.  3 to 7, Dallas time.  They'll coordinate it. 
[00:34:00]  214-787-1053 for the new listeners who want to have fun.  Go to whackbag.com.  That's where everyone gets together to have a little fun.  You take care of it.  Bye.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's say hi to Jim in St. Louis.  Jim, what's up?  Hey.  Morning, boys.  Sweet kids.  Morning.  Sunday Post-Dispatch.  The first five pages on the Sunday Post is talking about XM kicking the shit out of  Terrestrial Radio.  On the front page, they've got a life-size picture of the XM to go MiFi. 
[00:34:30]  Of course, they couldn't put the little doggy one on there.  They'd have to have an extra edition.  But the headline is, what happened to the Mighty Mox?  KMOX, which is a 50,000-watt station, has had Cardinal baseball for 52 years, and MLB  on XM kicked the shit out of them in, what, nine months?  They've lost almost all of their territory because of XM. 
[00:35:00]  And then it goes on to, on the bottom of it, it says there's a lot of competition over  the air radio, and over the air radio is the big loser in here.  They just go on for five pages explaining how XM has got six million listeners and that the  6 million, where are they hiding most?  Where are they hiding a couple more?  Yeah, there you have it.  All right, Jim, thank you so much. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, boy.  There goes Jim in St. Louis.  And, you know, the people that are lobbying to get XM or any type of satellite radio regulated  by the FCC are the scumbags in commercial radio because they don't want the competition  of people saying whatever they want to say without being fucking slaves to advertisers.  Anytime satellite wants to branch out and do anything, regular radio comes in and tries  to shut them down.  They want the FCC to jump in there and regulate them.  And it's all out of fear.  They see it coming.  They don't want to acknowledge it, but they see it. 
[00:36:00]  It's the future.  That's what's happening.  Who isn't good?  Why would you listen?  And I'm not even talking about our show.  I'm talking about any show.  Why would you listen to one that is interrupted with commercials and can't speak their mind  or speak in a way that people speak on a daily basis or a show like this where you can?  Why would you listen to the other one?  I love guys like, dude, I'll never pay for radio.  Go ahead.  Jerk off.  Good.  Listen to the commercials and the nonsense and the unfunny, phony laughter. 
[00:36:30]  Go ahead.  Enjoy it.  Same guy with the tinfoil on the rabbit ears on his television.  No, they have cable now.  But I'm like, what are you sitting there on paper TV?  He's like, yeah, but they're Sopranos.  We've got to break in here.  The shuttle's about to land.  Is it?  Finally, yeah.  Really?  They're getting close.  Shuttles are about to enter Earth's atmosphere.  I think we have another 45 minutes or so before it lands.  It'll be a little while.  God, that one astronaut's mom is becoming a superstar.  She is a pisser.  I heard her on 1010 Winds and couldn't stop laughing. 
[00:37:00]  We heard her, I guess, when they launched.  She's very worried, very concerned about her little boy.  She's a mother in Queens.  I guess she's 80 years old.  And she's an old Italian woman.  And her son is up there in the shuttle.  And, of course, the first one up since the last disaster, she's very worried.  And she's very vocal about how worried she is and how much of a mama's boy her little astronaut is.  And I don't know. 
[00:37:30]  If I was this guy, I'd be a little embarrassed.  I think he just wants to stay up there.  Just keep orbiting.  I think this whole space shuttle thing is about this one astronaut wanting to stay away from his mom.  Mission control, I think there's a lot of problems.  We're going to go around one more time.  Very nervous.  And worried about my boy.  And I need to speak with him immediately.  Put him on the phone, please.  Yeah, um, can we take this to the moon? 
[00:38:00]  I think if we just go to the moon, we do a few laps around the moon, we come back, I don't know, maybe a month.  Here's the clip from last week to get everyone up to speed.  He's very, very sure that everything is fine.  He's very happy.  And he said everything is great.  And we expect him back next Monday.  All right, that one's a little calmer than the ones we've heard.  Expect him next Monday, of course.  Here's the one.  With his glasses and his shoes.  Here's the one from this morning. 
[00:38:30]  Courtesy of 1010 Wins.  Meantime, the tension mounts for the queen's mother of a shuttle crew member who just wants her son back on solid ground.  It's been another sleepless night for Ray Karmada as she waits for Charlie to land.  Oh, God, if they don't come down soon, I'll have to go up and get them.  I can't put up with this much longer, really.  As Charlie's brother and other family members gather to watch the landing, Ray wonders if Charlie has his cell phone on.  She wants to call him and tell him to come home.  Oh, please come home soon. 
[00:39:00]  I can't take much more.  The family is glued to the direct line from NASA.  Charlie, call Collect.  It's okay.  I'll reverse the charges from the shuttle.  Call me from the shuttle because I worry about you.  Isn't that great?  And he's going to get down there and have to spend a little time with him.  But this was his only time.  You could tell this is his only time away from that woman.  Yeah.  Oh, why don't you come over? 
[00:39:30]  I'm making pasta.  Come over.  I haven't seen you in so long.  And I worry.  I love the line.  I'm going to have to go up there myself and bring them home.  I'm going to get them.  How is she going to do that?  Gas up the Valiant.  We're going to get them.  I'm getting my Charlie.  We're going into space.  Is the shuttle safe?  She's a superstar, though.  Oh, they love her.  When this thing lands, I mean, they're just waiting outside our house, I believe. 
[00:40:00]  Oh.  It's going to be great audio later today.  You really, you know, I just hope that everything goes well because you don't want to see her.  Oh, my Charlie.  Oh.  I knew it.  The shuttle.  Oh.  Poor bastard.  Yeah, she's something.  The news really loves her because she's very colorful.  Yes.  80 years old.  Yes.  All right.  Just like a mom.  She said she said that it was like she worried about him like when he was little and crossed 
[00:40:30]  the street.  Oh, really?  She said that?  Every time she opens her mouth, there's another.  The guy, he's a freaking astronaut.  Right.  He's a man.  Don't worry about him.  He's okay.  He's his own man.  I worry when he crosses the street.  Very worried.  Call me.  Reverse the charges.  Your father will pay for it.  You would think becoming an astronaut that his peers wouldn't mess with him.  Oh.  But they're just messing with him up there. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, Charlie.  Your mommy called again.  Just got to be hammering a mama's boy astronaut.  Mm-hmm.  Well, when do they come down?  8, 12?  About a half hour or so.  Yeah.  8, 12 Eastern.  Landing out there.  It's going to be dark.  Not really going to see much.  No.  They want to have a big spectacular Florida landing in the daylight.  But it's going to be dark.  You can watch, though.  They have that night vision stuff, so we'll be watching. 
[00:41:30]  Godspeed, shuttle crow.  Godspeed.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  When we get back, we've got to, well, just continue the program.  We've got lots to do today.  Poor Peter Jennings, huh?  Oh.  We also have Ronna Fez coming in at 8 o'clock.  We gave out a golden ticket to Ronna Fez, and we couldn't be happier.  And they're going to do the show with us today starting at 8.  And we have four more golden tickets to give away.  Yeah.  To save four more shows from that commercial radio. 
[00:42:00]  I think we have a clip of the astronaut there.  The son.  Mom!  I'm not going to order.  I have to do this now.  Mom, please stop calling.  But I worry.  I worry so much.  When is the shuttle coming down?  Are you coming over Sunday for pasta?  Your father needs help with the...  Mom!  Yes!  I'm not going to order.  I have to do this now. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, too good, man.  Also, Bob Saget stopping by to say hi.  Yes.  You flew home with Bob Saget.  I did indeed.  From Los Angeles, flew home with Bob Saget.  How about we do a whole celebrity thing?  Yeah.  After the break.  After the break.  Because I flew home with the Sugar Hill Gang.  Oof.  Really?  A hip hop, a hippie, a hippie-dippie, hip hip hop, a don't-stop-a-rockin' guy?  And also, to wrap up the celebrity break we'll do next, I got myself in a little trouble outside a Hollywood movie premiere last night. 
[00:43:00]  Ooh!  Details on the way.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the ordinary virus.  I'm my savior.  Huh?  I'm not your savior.  I'm just Beth.  Cool Beth.  Beth, my girlfriend.  Oh, that's boring clothes.  What, am I scaring you?  Want me to scare you?  Boo, boo, boo!  Beth.  Fear no mind. 
[00:43:30]  This is a harmless retard.  Just don't make eye contact.  I'm having you!  That is hilarious.  Oh, is that the best line ever?  Another intolerant person on the bus.  Meanwhile, to me, those are the best people so far.  Of course.  Hendry and those two.  Hendry.  An intolerant person.  Just a harmless retard.  Don't make eye contact.  That's absolutely true.  Big dummy with panda legs. 
[00:44:00]  That's what she has.  Legs like a fat white panda.  She should be tugging a windbreaker through a cage.  Fat whore.  I'm hearing you!  Boo!  When are you going to take me for a ride in your car?  In a green car, my case lurker.  Oh, Olivia, huh?  Yes, Olivia.  She's pretty and she's nice.  Oh, that's a hell for me and you, Gene, live. 
[00:44:30]  I think he's a jerk.  You think he's a jerk, Rick?  I don't think he's a jerk.  I think he's a little impatient.  Yeah, well, he put up that sign in the bathroom that says only employees can use it.  That didn't stop you, though, did it?  No, because I'm a person and it's just a bathroom.  If I use it, I don't think I'm hurting anybody.  Yeah, that's great.  Employees work all day.  Sometimes I go in there and I don't have to go to the bathroom just to wash my hands or make them mad. 
[00:45:00]  Just to wash my hands.  How stupid can one person be?  Sometimes I just wash my hands.  Oh, you work hard and that dummy walks in and takes one of her retard dumps with gum and pennies in it.  Little shards of glass and fur. 
[00:45:30]  Toby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:46:00]  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Getting more gooder every day, huh, Anthony?  Much more gooder.  Huh, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Ron and Fez will be joining the program in about ten minutes.  A lot of people are like, where's Ron and Fez?  Yeah, people are saying, you fucking idiots can't even get people that you hire to appear on your show.  That's kind of funny.  They will be here 8 a.m. sharp.  As soon as they get here, we'll throw them on the microphones.  Don't you worry, okay?  Right. 
[00:46:30]  All right.  Where do we go from here?  Yeah, Peter Jennings died of that lung cancer.  The big C.  I told you guys.  Casino, Tony.  I saw him in Central Park like two months ago.  Walking.  Yeah, I guess your words didn't help.  Walking with his two kids, his daughter and his son.  What awful thing did you shout out to the man?  Well, he was looking feeble.  It was actually pretty helpful when you yelled.  I was impressed.  It was well thought out and it obviously hit him.  I forget what it was.  It was inspiring, wasn't it?  I remember being impressed going, wow, that was what you'd want to say to somebody who's 
[00:47:00]  very sick.  And the sad part is he had to acknowledge it, you know, so he had to like raise his weak  arm.  Oh.  I really liked Peter Jennings, by the way, a lot.  As far as, you know, I didn't know him personally, but I thought he did a good job on the news  there, as far as network news goes.  Seemed very reputable.  But I had my cancer, well, I still wear the cancer bracelet for Brother Wheeze and, you  know, so I felt a little bit of a bond there and he's walking with his daughter and his  son and I saw him coming for a while, so I knew I had to say something. 
[00:47:30]  You had time to think this out.  I had time to think something.  That's what you blurted out.  And he gets closer and closer.  I'm panicking.  I'm starting to sweat a little bit.  And also I just said, hey, Peter, good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  That's a 67-year-old journalist.  Yeah.  That's an exact quote.  Good luck, bro.  Inspiring words indeed.  Good luck, bro. 
[00:48:00]  But he lost his battle with lung cancer.  What's the matter?  You didn't have the number of a good wig maker you could hand him real quickly?  Oh!  You want to...  Ow!  Very, very sad, though.  Yeah!  Stop it.  It is indeed sad.  Well, I was just pointing out the inappropriateness.  I didn't know.  Yes, I understand.  I understand.  Fun.  We got some Peter Jennings audio really fast.  So, finding this evening from us bread and circuses, there have always been complaints about entertainment pushing the limits of taste, including the outrageous ways that Romans, the emperors, that is, entertained the masses. 
[00:48:30]  Entertainers continue to outrage the public.  Yesterday, two so-called radio shock jocks were fired for orchestrating an obscene stunt in New York's most famous Catholic cathedral.  And again, we're asking, when do you cross the line?  The only guy that had a fair report on what happened to us, the only guy that had some kind words to say. 
[00:49:00]  So, have a lucky for Peter Jennings.  He was a smoker for 20 years.  And he, uh...  Or he was a smoker and he quit for 20 years.  And then, uh, after 9-11, picked it right back up again and started smoking.  Would that give you, like, in that short a time, he must have had something going on.  I mean, I don't know how cancer works, but can you get it?  Like, 2001, four years later, all of a sudden, you don't have cancer, all of a sudden, you got it and you're dead. 
[00:49:30]  He probably, he probably had it, like, you know...  What, do you eat cigarettes for breakfast and soup?  How fucking much do you smoke in four years where your clean lungs all of a sudden kill you?  He probably smoked a lot for the years that he smoked.  And then quit for 20 years.  But he probably had, like, he was a few cigarettes away from getting it.  You know, if he would have not picked up smoking again, he probably would have been okay.  Ah, time for some dessert.  How about a nice pile of cigarettes with whipped cream? 
[00:50:00]  I just don't understand the people that are still smoking out there.  I just don't get it.  You can't smoke.  I just don't get it.  It's the worst thing you can do to yourself.  That dumb Voss.  I'm never concerned with what people do.  I don't care.  But Voss, I have really been trying to get Voss to quit smoking.  It's like, I'm not even trying to be funny.  Stop smoking, stupid.  He just went for something, didn't he?  Said he had a problem with his stomach or something.  Yeah, it turned out it was just a bad load.  I mean, it happens.  There are some people that could smoke their entire lives and nothing. 
[00:50:30]  And they'll live to 90.  Well, that's what everybody likes to point out.  Hey, remember this old woman?  And they'll still go jogging and stuff.  But the fact is, a lot of people are dying from the cigarettes.  Lots and lots of people.  Four years he got it and died.  Geez, that's scary.  That was it.  Yeah.  And he just had it where there was no getting rid of it.  They knew right away.  That was it.  He went pretty quickly.  What was it?  He said something in April.  He said something in April.  April.  He obviously knew before then, probably a few months. 
[00:51:00]  So, I would bet six months after he found out, dead.  Maybe he hadn't gone for a checkup in years.  I don't know what his medical history was, but it seems pretty quick.  Yeah.  And for all you people, this is a story that relates to Peter Jennings.  For all you people that think there's a God out there.  Oh, my goodness.  You're going to your church every Sunday and praying.  We like to point out little things where we like to think that maybe there's just not a God. 
[00:51:30]  He apparently works in mysterious ways, but this is just fucking cruel.  Dana Reeve.  Yeah?  Has cancer.  Can you believe this?  Dana Reeve, the widow of beloved actor Christopher Reeve, is said to have been diagnosed with lung cancer.  She wiped that guy's ass and stayed by his side for years.  A saint, this woman.  Stayed with Christopher Reeve. 
[00:52:00]  He dies.  She mourns.  It's probably just about now she's getting to the point where she might be able to move on with her life and start anew.  And she gets the big casino.  The courageous 44-year-old singer and stem cell activist.  She's even trying to do good with her life.  Yeah.  Has already begun treatment for the illness.  Reeve's agent did not return calls last night, but one friend sadly corroborated the story. 
[00:52:30]  I don't want to talk about it, the pal told us.  It's horrible and bizarre.  I was just with her a couple of weeks ago.  I'd like to say something to her.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, sis.  Yeah, I was going to go sis, but I wanted the exact quote.  You think she was nice to him.  I've heard she was, but I've also heard mixed reviews that a lot of times when they were fighting, she would hide his hats.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[00:53:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And now, the cancer song.  Oh, this is awful.  What was this from?  Fucking ER.  ER.  ER.  ER.  Who watches the goddamn hospital shows?  Stop with the doctor and hospital shows.  Ugh.  You watch them, and all of a sudden, you spend the whole night thinking you've got something.  It's awful.  That's what I want to watch.  I want to watch a doctor have to go to a mother in the waiting room and say that her son died in that car wreck or something. 
[00:53:30]  Ugh.  Why depress yourself?  Put on Seinfeld, you maniacs.  I gave up on ER.  Get a laugh.  I finally gave up on ER about four or five years ago.  You did?  Yeah, yeah.  I like the cop shows.  I like watching some scales get shot.  That's fun.  But the hospital shows?  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh.  He's got the brain tumor.  You learn about so many things that could just kill you. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, it's awful.  Oh, Goose has a brain tumor now.  Before I started watching ER, I knew of about five things that could kill you.  Heart attack, car accident, cancer, unfortunately.  At the big C.  Sure.  And, uh, I don't know, anvil falling on your head.  Yeah.  Now, after ER, oh, there's hundreds of ways to die.  You go into the hospital.  You watch ER.  Someone goes in the hospital.  Oh, I just had a little bloody nose, and I was, you know, a little dizzy.  Oh, that's all, huh?  Dead.  Brain tumor.  Dead. 
[00:54:30]  Dead before the end of the fucking episode.  Dead before the last commercial.  You learn about so many ways to die.  Oh, it's got to be compelling, though.  I've got to play devil's advocate.  They've got to have some kind of, you know, no one wants to watch TV.  What's the matter?  It's a hangnail.  I would be fine with that.  If the characters were compelling, I don't care if they had a little hangnail.  Call your mother.  I have bunions.  Nobody would watch that program.  It's horrible.  I hate doctors.  So they have this song playing as, uh, who was the doctor that died in Hawaii? 
[00:55:00]  Goose.  Yeah, Goose.  Goose from Top Gun.  Yeah, the dude from Revenge of the Nerds.  He had it for a long time, because his hair fell out ten years before.  They set him up on a deathbed overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Hawaii.  Oh, wonderful.  That's nice, fun, friggin' programming.  Gee, why didn't you send me to Hawaii while I was alive and well, you asses?  If you really cared about me.  You're laying there withering away, trying to sip pineapple juice, but it burns.  Why do you want to depress yourself? 
[00:55:30]  Why do you want to depress yourself when you watch the TV?  For all those people out there that have cancer and you're going to die soon, go to Minnesota in the middle of winter.  Why?  Because then you'll, you'll, you'll want death.  Yeah.  Oh, I got, okay.  Why would you go to Hawaii?  You're seeing hot babes in bikinis and, and dudes like, uh, surfing on, you know, 50-foot waves.  Yeah.  It's a perfect afternoon and you're dying of cancer.  Go to fuckin' Minnesota, dude.  Horrible. 
[00:56:00]  Go to Detroit.  Go to the ghetto of Detroit.  You'll welcome death.  Pat from Unaki has a little bit of irony.  Uh, I bet the horse that threw Christopher Reeve is doing just fine.  He's out to pasture, out to stud, just fuckin' and eating his oats.  I'm not gonna erase him.  That's very funny.  Very funny, Pat.  Very good.  Yeah, but they set him up on a nice, like, I think it was a straw bed. 
[00:56:30]  Oh.  One of these rooms that have no, no walls really.  Right, like a hut.  So the breeze is coming in and the curtains are like.  Was there a bamboo ceiling fan spinning over him?  Yeah.  And the curtains are fluttering.  Yuck.  And that's how he gets to die.  Was it sad?  It was horrible.  Hey, Dr. Green, Goose, good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  That's from Thad Scott from Cincinnati.  I bet he actually stopped treatment after that awful salutation.  Like, you know what?  If this is what the world has to offer, get me a silk pillow. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  Somebody's saying the worst doctor show is house.  They let you know there are hundreds of ways to kill you that doctors can't figure out until you die.  Yeah.  On an all-new house.  Ah, help me!  My brain's coming out my nose!  House must solve another medical mystery.  I don't know.  I came in, my elbow itched, and then my arm fell off. 
[00:57:30]  House.  It's like, I hate watching those.  You're so right, Anthony.  Life sucks to begin with.  Why would you go home after your horrible day and watch half these shows?  Why?  You know what I like?  I like when George tries to park the cars, and he screws up, and that's what I want to see.  I want to see them pitching Seinfeld to the NBC executive.  Those are funny goddamn shows.  Funny shows.  MASH is a great doctor show.  You know something?  It was all gunshot wounds. 
[00:58:00]  I figured if I stayed out of Korea, I'd be okay so I could watch MASH.  It's true.  Medical shows.  Yeah, military shows, that's fine.  I don't like medical.  I used to watch Emergency.  Squad 51, Engine 51, and they'd go out with a fire.  Somebody on a construction site got hurt.  But very rarely would they have a medical problem, though.  I don't like that stuff.  Gives me the, what they call the heebie-jeebies.  And then you sit there all night feeling your glands, and going, what's that? 
[00:58:30]  Eh, don't need that.  My favorite was Quincy, and that homoerotic relationship he had with that Asian Sam.  That creepy late-night ghoul traipsing around in a white little lab coat and a heart on.  Bad teeth.  Yeah, it was a corner.  I didn't really worry about that show, either.  I got a toast to Dana Reeve.  Ah, you do?  Let me raise my club soda.  Get your hankies out.  Here it comes.  Here's to you, sis. 
[00:59:00]  Here's to you.  Here's to you.  Great.  I hope they bought a plot.  How old are her kids?  That's really, that sucks.  Dude.  I struggle with this God thing on a daily basis.  I really do.  You gotta just wonder when stuff like this hits.  Oh.  They got like the dashboard of the shuttle up there.  Look at the speed.  It's going from 7,300 miles per hour.  Look how fast the speed is going down. 
[00:59:30]  And the temperature is 1,750 degrees.  Yeah.  Wow.  This thing's gonna land, I would have to say, real soon.  Uh, 10 minutes.  The leading edge of the shuttle, the temperature is 1,730 degrees.  Yeah.  Well, they have to slow down just by lifting up a little bit and kind of the wind pushing  against the back of the wings.  They have no brakes.  Distance to the runway, 425 miles.  3, 2, 1, 20, 19, 18. 
[01:00:00]  Look how fast they do a mile.  Holy shit.  13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.  Holy, that's really how fast they're doing a mile?  They're doing a mile.  They're doing a mile in less than a second?  And they're at about 150,000 feet altitude.  Damn, that is fast.  Wow, that is really cool.  It's too bad that they're not gonna be flying shuttles anytime soon.  No, they gotta fix it.  Come up with a whole new design. 
[01:00:30]  They have speculation that they're gonna eventually do that with commercial airliners  once they can find a feasible way to put them up in the atmosphere  or just to shoot them out of the atmosphere real quick and drop them down.  You can go to L.A. in an hour.  Well, not even 40 minutes.  I'd love to do that.  With a heat shield.  Yeah.  They need some kind of force field.  We need the force field.  We were promised flying cars in a force field by the year 2000.  What happened?  We got none of that.  Nope.  Rogaine and pocket pussies.  Welcome to the new century. 
[01:01:00]  Bird and Philly, Anthony.  Yes?  He'd like to say, good luck, bro, to the shuttle crew.  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Good luck, good luck, bro.  That's bad enough if the guy's 18 or 20, but if he's 67 and one of the most respected  journalists in the country, that's just awful.  The worst part about that, he had to acknowledge it.  He had to, like, look at me and kind of raise his arm like, hey, thanks.  Thanks for the words.  Oh, there is a visual on the shuttle. 
[01:01:30]  It's a little spot.  Hey, I heard, by the way, that you met Colin Powell.  Sorry to interrupt you, but I wanted to quote Opie before I forgot, because I remember when  you met Colin Powell, and you impressed him by pointing, going, what up, nigga?  Ooh.  Yeah.  Gave him the black power sign from the 70s.  Let's say hi to Matt.  Matt, what's going on?  Hi, Matt.  What's up?  I just called the Howard Stern show just to fuck around a little bit, and they totally  dumped out of my entire punchline.  I called up and I asked about how Robin was upset about her birthday, and I asked her if 
[01:02:00]  it was because Jimmy Norton gave her a yellow discipline, and they totally dumped me out  of the air.  Ah, that's a pussy.  Why?  Couldn't help plug my CD?  I don't know.  I mean, she just denied the truth that you actually did urinate on her.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks, sweetie.  All right.  We're 150 miles away now?  48.  Huh?  47.  It's going a lot faster than that.  Distance to runway in miles.  They bring it in over the water this time.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, they usually bring it in over land when they're landing here, but nope.  They said, let's just keep everything over the ocean just in case.  I heard that they can't go back up, too, if they, like, screw up and miss the runway.  It's not powered.  It's a glider at that point.  You just, you have no power.  So, if you miss your approach, you're landing regardless.  All right.  This is...  We can use data gathered from air data probes deployed on...  95 miles out.  ...to update onboard navigation.  They supply updates on altitude and airspeed based on measurements of barometric pressure 
[01:03:00]  and wind speed.  Charlie?  Charlie, can you hear me?  Hi, darling.  I see your shuttle.  I could see a bright light.  Where's my Charlie?  Stop talking.  Charlie?  87,000 feet.  You realize the normal commercial airliner usually flies around 30,000 feet.  The old Concords, which were the highest flying commercial airliners, would fly at about 50,000 feet.  So, you realize just how much higher still Discovery is. 
[01:03:30]  Charlie, are the landing gear still up, Charlie?  Charlie, are the landing gear still up?  Mom!  I love the Lord.  I have to do this now.  Did you lower the landing gear, Charlie?  Mom!  I love the Lord.  I have to do this now.  But you have to lower the landing gear, Charlie.  In order for the shuttle to land.  Mom!  Please stop calling me.  I see the bright light.  It's like the sparkle in your eyes, Charlie.  Please come home to me. 
[01:04:00]  How fast is your heart beating?  It was a fantastic ride from about Mach 5 down or five times a few years now.  All right, it's getting close now, huh?  Yeah.  It seems to happen faster.  Even though the vehicle is going slower, you're much busier in the cockpit.  You're paying more attention to the stuff that's in front of you.  When I was flying with Jim Weatherby, it was fantastic.  I think by this point, they were already burnt up, you know, in the other one.  It made it through.  On course and proper speed.  And Jim brought that to our attention. 
[01:04:30]  So it's for me, interesting to hear about his flying to the Edwards Air Force face.  Saying, talking about the vehicle making funny noises.  But fantastic experience.  46 miles to touchdown for Discovery.  How many miles?  And now it's really beautiful to watch is how you begin to get some definition.  That's a great wing configuration of Discovery as it comes in.  Discovery's wings leveling as it approaches the landing site.  Still doing 1,200 miles an hour.  You really can see the shape.  Form a right overhead 196 degree turn to line with runway 22. 
[01:05:00]  As Discovery goes to Sonic.  You'll hear the boom.  Commander Eileen Collins will take over manual control of Discovery's flight.  Where's Charlie?  Woman driver.  Yeah.  Chick is landing it.  Don't let the broad land this thing, Charlie.  They can't drive.  Your father always says the broads can't drive, Charlie.  That's right.  And there may be a chance for the co-pilot Vegas to touch the stick a little bit in preparation 
[01:05:30]  for maybe a future flight assignment.  Me and your father will meet you at the bag in the carousel, Charlie.  We'll see if you put something on your bag so we know it's yours.  I don't want to get it mixed up with the Chinamans.  The slower you go, the faster things happen.  So you really have to pay attention to that very well.  Compartmentalize, as we call it.  Oh, that's a shuttle, all right.  Flying it like a fighter jet rather than an ocean liner up in space. 
[01:06:00]  The other thing to remember, though, is it looks like the vehicle is coming down very slowly  and stately, and it's very beautiful, as you mentioned.  But physiologically, they're also working very hard.  Their hearts are pumping more blood up to their heads.  Remember, now for two weeks, they've been weightless.  The hearts have not had to operate as bad, haven't had to pump as much blood, opposing gravity.  Now, with the G-forces coming around and also gravity, the hearts are really pumping fast, 
[01:06:30]  keeping the blood up to their heads.  It's going to land in about three minutes, Anthony.  Yes.  They're pressurizing their legs.  Still that far away?  Are they in circles?  Yes.  They've got to turn around or something.  But she isn't thinking about any of that.  She's focused on the runway and trying to grease the landing in for another perfect land view.  30,000 feet.  That's their view from the cockpit again.  Discovery's descent to the runway.  I am taking a guess here, but I think this is a picture from the cockpit of Discovery as...  Turn the camera to my jolly, though!  ...banking turn is made to head back for the runway at Edwards. 
[01:07:00]  20 times steeper than a commercial descent.  You know what that G-force must be like?  To give you some extended...  Oh!  To give you some...  Oh, we're still alive.  That's good news.  Yeah, that's good.  ...turn to line with runway 22.  Yeah.  Give you some sense of how people are so interested in this.  Just outside our studios in Times Square, looking at our giant screen that is projected up here above our studios.  Our crowds are gathering here in New York just to watch this land.  And until we get landing now, just over two minutes from now, I want to listen in to NASA Select as they bring the ship down. 
[01:07:30]  Discovery, Houston, on at the 90.  Discovery, on at the 90.  It's impossible! I'm trying to tell you that! What do you want? You want the chance to come out of my eyes?  Just over 10 miles to touch down for Discovery.  Yeah.  Boy, this takes a long time, Opie.  Sure does. 
[01:08:00]  Yep.  To this or a 15-minute commercial break.  Yeah, what do you want?  You choose.  It's very exciting.  Yow, yow.  Yeah, we know we're on delay.  Having been completed.  I believe people, they'll watch it land and then hear us going, well, here it comes.  Here it comes.  A live view out the forward windows.  Or if it smashes into something, like, such a dump, he'll be like, ah, it looks good.  Yeah, still looking good.  All right, we'll pull him.  And touchdown! 
[01:08:30]  It made it.  There you go.  Screw you bastards.  Rune their little surprise.  I got that nose-on camera now.  Kind of looking at the front of the shuttle as it comes in.  Night vision camera out there.  That is really cool.  I wish Continental had one of those.  Give me one quick shot to get 11 million frequent flyer miles.  First class for the rest of the millennium.  Hey, what happened to your little Continental there at Newark?  Nothing.  Bumped a couple of planes, got bumped into by a Continental 737 in Newark. 
[01:09:00]  It happens.  We're on the runway?  Yeah, on the runway.  They were taxiing.  Get out of the way.  Two smaller commuter planes.  Exactly.  Faggots beat it.  Real plane coming through.  Jimmy Norton's got to get somewhere.  That must have really sucked because they've got to pull everybody off of three planes.  Absolutely, but you know what?  It happened on the ground.  No harm done.  No harm, no foul.  No harm, no foul.  Here we go, guys.  Oh, here it comes.  And touchdown.  Fine, perfect.  Perfect landing.  The shoot comes out. 
[01:09:30]  There it is.  And it rolls to a stop.  That's right.  Look at that.  They got out.  Everything's okay.  Boring!  That's it.  I know.  Believe me, I was rooting for the same thing I didn't want to say.  Oh, stop.  What a mess.  Boring.  Why hasn't he phoned yet?  And Discovery is home.  And Discovery is home.  Nose gear touchdown.  There.  And Discovery is home.  I was hoping for our big broadcast moment where we would have to announce that the thing 
[01:10:00]  had a major problem.  We've had a malfunction.  Shuttle slowing.  The view from the cockpit.  Here.  Let's see how to mic.  Now a bunch of black guys are going to come out and take their luggage out of a compartment  on the side.  Hey, man.  If it is in every city, it's amazing, isn't it?  Are they allowed to use their cell phones at this moment?  You can now use your cell phone.  John Harrington.  I don't care how confident NASA spoke. 
[01:10:30]  I don't care how reassured everyone was.  Yes, we understand.  We get it.  You still held your breath today.  I've got to be honest.  We had a female pilot on the way home and a co-pilot.  So did I.  An Asian girl.  Oh, no.  I didn't have one of them, thank God.  What the hell was up with that?  It frightened me.  It is, I mean, what a chauvinist pig I am.  You have that little, like, you don't make me feel better?  Honest to God.  Because I looked, she had a man arm.  Her left arm was a masculine arm.  Yeah.  It's when she turned and I realized she was a woman.  She had glasses and a mullet.  I'm like, oh, okay.  We know what she does in bed.  She's got to be qualified. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  You like that, then?  A lesbian?  Acceptable.  I had an Asian woman that walked into the cockpit and I'm looking up going, oh, no.  Please go right.  Go right.  Go right.  And she sat in the right seat.  Yeah, mine too.  And then a little, a short, like, Mexican-looking guy with a black eye was our pilot.  And he went walking by and I'm like, holy shit.  But then, for some reason, and I don't know why, when you see Bob Saget on the plane and 
[01:11:30]  Leslie Ann Warren was also on the plane, I'm thinking, man, you can't lose Bob Saget and  Leslie Ann Warren in a crash.  So I'm probably pretty safe.  Yeah, you're right.  It's never happened in music or anything like that.  Good point.  Because celebrities never die in plane crashes.  Safe place to be.  I don't know why, you know.  That's the last place I want to see a celebrity on a plane crash, because I know I'm going to  get second billing.  I was done.  I wasn't even getting a mention.  Bob Saget killed, along with Leslie Ann Warren and Chuck Chuck.  And, yeah, I would have been with the other shoes. 
[01:12:00]  That would have been nothing.  Gone.  Not even a mention.  How was it flying with Bob Saget, though?  Cool.  He's a good guy.  He's coming in today.  What a coincidence.  He was very funny.  A lot of fun.  Goofing on everything.  And, man, that poor bastard, though.  There is not...  He cannot go anywhere.  He is one of the most recognized people on the face of the earth.  Everywhere.  Because we kind of...  We walk to the baggage carousel together, Opie.  And there's just people just gawking and hiding behind, like, poles, peeking out, tapping 
[01:12:30]  their friends, pointing.  It's amazing.  The guy cannot go anywhere.  Did he have an assistant with him, or was it just him?  Just him.  He don't care.  It's a comic for you.  Just him.  Yeah.  I hear you guys have become friends.  Oh, the best of pals.  Well, he told you to walk to the baggage claim with him.  Well, we were kind of walking the same direction, so...  I've got to go to Ticket!  I've got to go to Ticket!  Hey, look who it is!  I've got to go to Ticket! 
[01:13:00]  I've got to go to Ticket!  It's Augustus Gloop!  Yeah!  You guys that listen to 202 have no idea what you got yourselves into.  That was Russ Martin.  No, that wasn't a fuck-o.  That was Fez from the Ron and Fez show.  Fez!  Yes, that was a man.  Anthony, I can relate to the Bob Saget being recognized thing.  Oh, you can! 
[01:13:30]  I have no clue that we're kind of in the entertainment business.  We're in the entertainment dumpster.  Like the garbage from entertainment, where they take it.  That's where we reside.  No, you don't.  You know where you reside?  When they dump the garbage out, there's that little liquid at the bottom.  Garbage juice.  Garbage juice at your service.  But I go about my life when we're not doing this show just assuming that no one's really  listening to this.  No one really reads the articles. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  And our names don't really mean anything.  Mm-hmm.  I was going to the supermarket yesterday, and the movie theater near me on the Upper West  Side was having a big Hollywood movie premiere for the new Rafe, Rafe Fiennes movie.  Oh, I pardon you.  His name is not Ralph.  It's Rafe.  Rafe?  I didn't know that.  Stop it.  Yeah, Rafe.  I did not know that.  That's Ralph.  It's not Ralph.  It's Rafe.  It's Rafe. 
[01:14:30]  Rafe Fiennes.  He's a rapist.  And Liam Neeson and the hot broad from the Mummy movies.  Oh.  And then stupid Cindy Adams had her do the red carpet.  And some old lady that I guess she just shows up to all the premieres in New York.  I don't even know who she was.  Sylvia something?  Never heard of her.  Sylvia Miles from Midnight Cowboy.  Oh, right.  We had her on the show once.  Did you?  She called in once, Sylvia Miles.  Remember, we wouldn't believe her.  Was she the one that said, you were going to ask me for money? 
[01:15:00]  Was that Sylvia Miles?  I think so, yeah.  Oh, that's the greatest.  She called our show, though.  So this big Hollywood movie premiere is happening.  They got the paparazzi and the press and the red carpet.  The whole deal, Anthony.  And I'm at the supermarket, Lindsay and I.  And I'm like, hey, you want to check this out, right?  So we have nothing to do, so what the hell?  So I get right to the railing.  Right to the railing.  So it's railing in front of me, a pit for paparazzi, like hundreds, not hundreds of them.  That's an exaggeration. 
[01:15:30]  Probably at least 25 to 30, though.  There's a lot of them there.  And right past the paparazzi, red carpet.  The red carpet.  I could spit on the red carpet, no problem.  I have the best view of this whole thing.  We're standing there checking the whole thing out.  Now, people are crowding all around me, you know, behind me, because, you know, they want to see it, too.  It's at least five, six people deep around this whole thing.  We've got a prime spot.  And I'm sitting there, and I see stupid Cindy Adams, and there's Sylvia Broad, and then there's a lonely action. 
[01:16:00]  And one of the photographers kept kind of looking over his shoulder at me.  Oh.  And I'm like, what the fuck is this guy looking at?  I couldn't figure it out.  Because I go through my life not thinking much about what we do.  I take it seriously, but when I'm not here, I don't even think that people would really care.  Very busy.  So he keeps looking at me and looking at me.  And I go to Lindsay.  The guy's looking at me, and I'm thinking, she's thinking that I'm just nuts for saying that.  Like, oh, yeah, like, you're going to get recognized.  Yeah, whatever, dude, right?  So then also the guy turns around, and he goes, good luck, bro. 
[01:16:30]  He goes, are you who I think you are?  And I'm waiting for the Owen Wilson comparison or the David Spade comparison or the James Spader comparison or the Darryl Hall or Oates?  Strawberry.  Darryl Hall.  I'm John Oates.  Or, yeah, or Darryl Hall, all these people I kind of look like.  So I'm thinking he's thinking I'm some, you know, some, I'm not even thinking he's thinking it might be me. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  I'm still thinking, oh, God, who do I look like, right?  If you lift your shirt, Adonis.  So I'm like, who do you think I am?  Like that, really just still clueless, really.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, he goes, no, you're him, right?  And I'm like, who?  He goes, and now I see him reaching for his camera.  Oh, the camera's coming up.  Now it's coming up because there was a lot on the action.  He goes, no, you're Opie from Opie and Anthony. 
[01:17:30]  Next thing you know, all the paparazzi turns around and all of a sudden, ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching.  Nice.  Lindsay runs off.  I'm stuck there just getting, like, just, I had to be at least.  She's very photogenic.  Had to be at least 10 or 12 of them just snapping like, like crazy.  Why'd she run away?  Wow, same question.  She didn't want her picture taken.  No?  No, that would be page six stuff.  Want to be in the papers, in the papers?  So then they're all taking pictures like crazy. 
[01:18:00]  And then they're like, is this your girlfriend?  They're freaking out, right?  And then half of them have to be asked, is whatever happened to you guys?  I'm like, Jesus, we've been doing satellite radio for a year.  So then all the people around me now are like, why are they taking this guy's picture?  And then someone said, that's Opie from Opie and Anthony.  So now all these idiots that were just hanging out around me, like, could care less who I was because I was just like them, checking out this whole scene.  Now they're taking their digital cameras and going nuts.  Going nuts.  The next thing you know, I'm signing autographs and people are like, half the people around me were huge fans of the show, didn't even know I was standing there. 
[01:18:30]  Next to the red carpet, he's signing autographs.  And then these people are like, dude, dude, why are you on this side of the fence when you could be over there?  And I'm still thinking, no, I can't be over there.  I'm just, I'm a schmuck like you guys.  We never get invited to any of those things.  No.  Premieres or anything.  And you see people that are on the comparable level of entertainment businesses as we.  I don't know how you make those connections. 
[01:19:00]  People are very afraid of this show.  I think that's why the listeners like it, because they realize that we're garbage.  Yeah, they are petrified to have us at any function, thinking we're just going to rip our clothes off and start spanking it like a monkey in the corner.  It is, with a national radio show form like this, it is amazing how people want nothing to do with us.  Quite fearful.  Yeah.  The movie's The Constant Gardener or something like that.  And the hot chick is Rachel Weiss or Weiss.  Weiss?  Yeah, sure.  I got to recognize it's so embarrassing sometimes. 
[01:19:30]  You want to be left alone and all of a sudden it's like, wait a minute, Daddy, I know you.  It was just one of those weird, surreal moments, because I'm thinking, you know, no one really cares.  But these paparazzi guys freaked out.  But I did point out to Lindsay during this whole process.  By the way, Lohan for everybody.  Yeah, exactly.  All the, I was pointing out all the paparazzi that we do know from our years of just fucking up.  Oh, that guy took our picture at that voyeur bus time, and this guy took it when we got fired from Sex for Sam. 
[01:20:00]  That guy was on the top of the courthouse steps during Anthony's divorce proceedings.  I mean, exactly.  This guy was camped out outside my house for like a week on a lawn chair.  I really, I really.  As soon as it was, but these guys are animals, because it was like, as soon as the one guy realized.  Yeah.  Then everyone else, because they're all in tune with each other.  They all turned at the same time.  And then they're screaming.  One guy's screaming, oh, over here for Front Page.  Front Page Magazine.  Front Page.  I don't even know what the hell Front Page is.  It's like, for Front Page. 
[01:20:30]  Front Page.  Over here, over here.  And then the funny thing is, they got all their shots, and then they didn't care again.  Then they all turned around and shot the real celebrities, and didn't even bother me for the rest of the time.  That's how it works.  Now those photos will be file photos.  Why not?  If you're ever in the news, if you ever do something, those are the ones they'll pull out.  You know what the worst part about that whole thing is?  At that point, I didn't shower for like two days.  That's where we did the L.A. thing.  That's the look, though.  L.A., and I was just lazy, so I didn't shower. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, that's fine.  But you know how the Post and the Daily News works?  Uh-huh.  Has hard times hit Opie?  Look at this.  Worst picture ever.  They always use worst picture ever in the paper.  So, it was just a weird, surreal moment.  I've got to ask you, who said you looked like Owen Wilson?  I've gotten that one for a while.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Except that I don't have the broken nose thing.  What Percy looks?  When I have longer hair.  Well, you keep it up, and we could fix that, too.  I've gotten that one.  I've gotten David Spade, unfortunately, when I had the longer hair. 
[01:21:30]  And James Spader.  Ugh.  James Spader, huh?  Have fun on Wackbag with the Photoshops.  There you go.  David Spade.  Also known as David Ortiz.  I didn't like that one.  That wasn't bad.  A little wordplay.  And I also, just to wrap this stupid celebrity breakup, I flew home with some celebrities.  The Sugar Hill Gang was on our plane.  The Sugar Hill Gang. 
[01:22:00]  And I want to kill Hawk.  Well, of course you do.  Our fine friend here, Eric.  Because we're at the airport.  We're going through security, and the Sugar Hill Gang is at LAX.  And they're so famous that they have to wear their t-shirts that say Sugar Hill Gang, so  people will recognize them in the airport.  Yeah.  The whole band had their Sugar Hill Gang t-shirts on, Anthony.  Pretty much saying, look at us, we're famous.  Look, I wouldn't even wear a wow shirt at the airport.  So Master Poe and Eric get really excited.  They need their pictures taken with the Sugar Hill Gang. 
[01:22:30]  And I guess the shots are up on OpieAndAnthony.com if you want to see them for yourself.  And Eric turns to me right in front of the guys and goes, hey, you want a shot with them  too?  Son of a bitch.  I hate when you guys do that.  Stop doing it.  No, you guys, it's only Eric.  I don't want a shot with Sugar Hill Gang.  And I don't want, if I'm not running to get a shot with some of these people that come  in to do our show.  Assume you don't want one.  That means I don't want a shot.  Because now you're making the celebrity look weird.  Yeah.  Because I'm like, right in front of Sugar Hill Gang, I'm like, nah, that's all right.  That's all right. 
[01:23:00]  We've had people come in like wrestlers and stuff.  And, you know, I don't take pictures with the celebrities.  It's the big ones.  You know, George Foreman comes in.  I'm getting a picture with George Foreman.  Things like that.  Ozzy.  Yeah, Ozzy.  Same thing.  A picture with Ozzy.  When a wrestler comes in or somebody else, a comic or something, I'm like, I don't take  pictures.  And Eric will always go, want to get a shot in front of the guy?  Now, what are you going to do?  No.  I don't care.  So now you've got to take a picture with the guy.  Don't ever ask. 
[01:23:30]  Eric doesn't mean it.  Look at him.  He's happily cheeked and eager.  He's so starstruck.  He's a little kid.  It's fine, but it was just...  Starstruck.  I was hoping that tractor trailer fell on you this morning when I saw the traffic report.  And by the way, looking at the picture, the Sugar Hill guy, Mr. Sugar Hill to the right,  he's an ass.  Little eight-year-old sneakers poking out of the bottom of a tractor.  The fat Sugar Hill guy?  Yeah.  Is he the lead singer?  Was it Wonder Mike?  I don't know.  Wonder Mike?  Stop it. 
[01:24:00]  You do not know their names.  I did a TV show with them years ago.  I don't care.  You don't know their names.  I can't help it.  It was me, Julio, the lady nun from, you know, Berlin, and Wonder Mike.  Wonder Mike is a fat fuck.  Language.  And he was sitting behind me, and I decided to recline to enjoy my flight from L.A. to New York.  And Wonder Mike didn't have enough room and had to tell me.  What did he say?  When you put your seat back?  Yeah.  He goes, could you wait to recline your seat until after we eat?  Not my problem, sir. 
[01:24:30]  Not my problem that you're a fat fuck.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  Why should you care what's going on behind you?  Especially in first class.  Right.  Just because he's fat.  Now, you can't put your seat all the way back?  Uh-uh.  So I did the big sigh, like, oh, God.  And then I had to move it back forward.  Oh, look, Steve was in the forest there in Jersey.  I just saw a picture of our own Steve in Jersey.  Rolling nude and foliage.  I knew it in the leaves. 
[01:25:00]  And there was a dart in his ass from a policeman's gun.  All right, guys, they're waiting outside.  We've got to say hi to Rana Fez.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, Rana Fez joined the program.  Afro show.  We gave out our first golden ticket to our old pals, Rana Fez.  I think you guys are going to love Rana Fez for the new listeners around the country.  I've got to go and get it!  I've got to go and get it!  I've got to go and get it!  They're no fuckos.  Maniac.  We'll reunite with Rana Fez next. 
[01:25:30]  Let's see how this comes out.  All right?  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  I've got to go and get it right.  I've got to go and get it right.  I can't go and get it right.  This is a story about a man.  He always was so lonely at night.  But his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy. 
[01:26:00]  Let's go.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  It's late at night.  And I have nowhere to go.  My money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says, 
[01:26:30]  And you know I have an angel.  And he says that angel.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  Shelter me.  Shelter me from the falling rain. 
[01:27:00]  You have bombs.  This is my life.  I'm living with so much pain.  That's just a little piece.  The A.P. and Anthony Show.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202. 
[01:27:30]  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  XM202.  This is a great day for Satellite Radio. 
[01:28:00]  A great day for Satellite Radio.  As we're all on the reef again.  I gotta go, dickhead!  I gotta go, dickhead!  Oh my fucking God, I gotta go, dickhead!  Gotta thank Drew Boogie for throwing this together.  Nice job.  They took your theme music and our theme music and mixed it.  Made some kind of conglomerated, malada, mongrel theme! 
[01:28:30]  We're already blown out the people's ears out there in radio land.  It's exciting just to get here in time.  It just looks like Jimmy Norton is waking up.  So this is the time to tell I want to be here.  Go with the baby!  You go with the baby!  I've been listening to you guys for the last couple months, and it's always funny to  hear, like, Jimmy's always doing that, hmm, yeah.  And then about 8.30, quarter to nine, I just hear him kick in. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  I just start tearing into a bed.  Goddamn ACLU can suck my dick!  But it's the slow burn, but now I know exactly how you feel, because getting up this morning,  we haven't done this in a lot of years, it's a beast.  It stinks.  It stinks.  It's awful.  I know, I had to kick a couple Cuban boys off of me, and it's just a mess.  I'll go with the gay angle, good.  That's good.  That's really going to help the red states that are listening.  Yeah, that's going to really go over nice.  Jesus, what's wrong with you? 
[01:29:30]  Did you have to pit uncircumcised boys?  So much for listeners in Alabama.  You know, every time we start a new gig, I go, you know, you don't have to do that angle  this time.  You know, you're funny in a lot of different ways.  And then you're locked in it for however long.  Yeah.  And then, see, here's the problem, when you're partners, because at one time it was a Ron  a Ron show, and Fez was, you know, in with us, and everybody would always say to me,  hey, is that friend of yours, is he gay, is he gay? 
[01:30:00]  And I'm laughing, having fun.  But then as soon as he became my partner, it became, are those guys gay?  Let them think what they want, Ron.  We don't care.  I care.  We're just going to live our lives.  I'm not.  We don't care.  I'm living a separate life, and I care.  Let them think what they want.  People would even ask my chick, they'd be like, hey, are those guys gay?  Ghost Ron had to say that right off the bat.  Of course.  Yeah.  They asked my chick.  Yeah, after I was done having sex with her, heterosex. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, right.  Hot and heavy for hours.  So you don't have to, you know, you can, you know, maybe go in a different angle this  time, Fez.  Okay, because I love the tang, man.  Yeah, I know you do.  I'll tell you, some puno, tear that up.  Sounds convincing.  Yeah.  He will.  He's biatches.  I like how it's still, you know, the tang and things instead of, like, hot, sloppy pussy  or something.  He's not used to it.  I know.  He's not used to it.  It takes a little bit of a while.  You kind of look around for a dump button when you say something inappropriate for a 
[01:31:00]  while.  You guys want to get the cursing out of the way?  No.  We have no plans, too, because...  That's good.  We said that for about a minute.  Right.  Because then you were still hoping you were going to syndicate back the other way, and now  you're like...  There was always that hope.  Right.  You're like, you know, we get...  And then you realize, why bother?  Right.  Why even bother?  Stupid Fareed got under our skin for a while, and he's like, you know, if you guys clean  up the show, I think I can get you back on commercial radio.  Yeah, remember those shows, people?  Remember the shows we tried to clean up? 
[01:31:30]  Oh, we never said we were cleaning them up, but you remember which ones they were.  Because you were emailing us every day, and we're like, no, we're not, you know, cleaning  up our show.  No, we just made a concerted effort to clean it, because we, it's our choice, and we...  Those shows sucked.  It's Ron and Fez, and, you know, when you guys do your first show, you'll see.  Every other word's going to be, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,  fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, and then the listeners, fucking great  to have you guys fucking back.  Fuck, fuck it.  They call up, and they, hey, no FCC, right, fucking A. Every call has to get it out. 
[01:32:00]  You know, it's weird, because, what was it, a month ago or so, we got suspended for a  week, because a listener said shit.  On the air.  On the air.  Yeah.  And I didn't, you know, I don't have a dump button, it's somewhere on the board, I don't  know where it is.  But don't, remember, Infinity has dump guys.  Yeah, it's supposed to have somebody.  Two of them missed it.  So, we got suspended, Bob worked it down to a vacation.  Good old super agent, Bob Eatman, right? 
[01:32:30]  What if we just give him vacation pay?  Bob, poor Bob, not a bad impression, let me hear it again.  What if we just give him vacation pay, my girl?  Too much excitement.  No, that's too exciting, too flamboyant, too colorful, yeah.  What a bore, huh?  Oh, when you have to sit in a meeting with that guy.  Are you happy, Fez?  It's satellite, are you happy?  All right, guys, this is going to be great for you.  This is fantastic.  It's everything you've ever wanted.  Patience, patience. 
[01:33:00]  For like the last six months, this is always hard for us.  Get out, get us out.  That's what we want.  We want out.  Can you be cool for me, Ron?  No, I gotta get out.  I can't breathe, Bob.  You gotta be cool.  Remember when he said to you not too long ago, uh...  Tell your partner.  No, no, no.  I didn't even know that one.  But when he said, when he compared you to, uh, O and I?  I don't remember.  Yeah, because you were screaming at him for something. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Screaming at him on the phone.  He goes, you're starting to sound like Opie and A.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I don't think I've...  I probably lost it in...  How long have you been with Bob?  Eight years.  Eight years, I guess.  Yeah, about eight years.  Yeah.  I probably have two occasions where I even raised my voice to the guy.  They must have really stood out in his mind, too.  But, uh, what?  You guys were really pounding him, though?  Well, it was a real weird deal. 
[01:34:00]  We thought we were coming here in March.  Yeah, so did we.  And I, yeah, I don't exactly even know what happened to this day, because, you know, we  were in the middle of a contract.  Bob did something or other...  Somebody else probably really got fucked over on their contract.  Well, that's what happens.  Bob, like, trades people around.  He's like a slave owner.  Yeah.  He, like, trades a couple here, and then he'll get some favors over from this guy.  Right.  If he gives him, like, three hacks and a newsman.  If you let Ron and Fez go, I will give you Rover and Columbus. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Right now, two poor guys are working in Haiti, doing overnights.  We're all Monopoly property.  Yeah, that's what it is.  And Baltic Avenue got screwed somewhere.  Gordy is calling him, get me out of Minneapolis.  There he is.  He's up.  Here he comes.  And I know just to do the first half hour to 45 minutes without him.  Is that right?  He needs his coffee, his food.  No worth whatsoever.  He's got to read the papers.  Hey, my favorite show you guys did was the X Games. 
[01:35:00]  That's my favorite.  That's not good.  Yeah.  You know what it's like?  Because, you know, it's not like I've never done the Plant City Strawberry Festival before.  You know, I've done some of those really bad remotes.  But it's kind of like when you were a kid, like on a little league team,  watching your friend take a bad hop across the forehead.  You know nobody can handle that ball.  And I'm just hearing motorcycles going over your head. 
[01:35:30]  And I swear to God, the greatest thing about it is I kept thinking that the same guy kept coming back to be interviewed.  Oh, I know.  Every person had the same exact personality.  It was the same thing.  And we asked them the same questions.  Because what the fuck else are you supposed to ask these people?  What are you supposed to ask them?  Towards the end, you could hear yourself getting hit with the dirt.  Is it raining inside the tent?  And where's the dirt?  That heavy.  We were all hacking because the dust was in our throats.  Yeah, you're doing a broadcast with dust in your lungs.  Those guys just made us look like faggots. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  With their scars and their injury reports.  But it was always, yeah, dude, well, we're, you know, going to tear it up out here.  Okay.  Next.  Good luck.  When do you ride?  Yeah.  Oh.  How about your tires?  Or fire stones?  What do you got?  You know, what are you going to say to these people?  I had fun, though.  We had a good time.  I very rarely am embarrassed when I walk away from a show.  I was embarrassed.  I bombed so badly.  It was okay.  It happens.  I deserved it.  I was fucking embarrassed to walk away from the microphone.  Yeah, you were a little hard on yourself. 
[01:36:30]  It was awful.  Awful.  Did you get a hooker that night to fix things up?  I did, actually.  You did?  Absolutely.  Of course.  Yeah.  You should let me dump inside of her.  What was his name?  Wow.  No, I didn't.  Hi, Daddy.  Well, the phone's just going nuts here.  Let's say hi to Dave.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  First thing, I want to say, well, two things to Ron and Fez.  First of all, welcome to the XM platform.  Thank you.  Second of all, shit dicks, how about showing up on time for your first day at work? 
[01:37:00]  Punch it out.  Well, they were kind of here.  Yeah.  They were here.  We made them wait like everyone else.  Not in seven.  Atlanta, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Ovi?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  The little Jimmy, my idol.  Ron and Fez, welcome.  How's it going, boys?  I just wanted to go back to memory lane of some of some famous bits that I remember  when I was a teenager, when my dad listened.  I remember the old thing, huddled with a taser to his nuts.  Oh, yeah.  You guys remember that one?  That was the Ron and Ron show when we used to do...  That was the Ron and Ron.  Spin the stunner. 
[01:37:30]  Spin the stun gun we had every morning.  And that was an ugly show.  His every name came up, took the stun gun.  And, hey, can Fez do the nature boy thing?  You know what?  I was even thinking about having him do that, but I don't know if he can hold it up anymore,  Fez.  My dad's listening, and he listens to the show.  Of course, I'm spreading the virus out.  That's the big thing he wanted to hear from Fez, because that's the big thing he remembers.  Well, we used to do that show as, like, late 80s, early 90s.  You never knew whether you were going to get a stun gun or a big rail of coke in the morning. 
[01:38:00]  All dependent on how the wheel landed.  And let's not forget the Tax Man song that sounded like that Beatles song.  That was a good one, too.  It's just...  It's a blur.  You know, it's like hearing about old girlfriends.  You're just not sure.  I'm sure something happened.  I love when I go down to Florida, and somebody knows me from radio, and your name comes up.  It's always some mysterious, weird story that comes up.  Where I don't even really know what he's talking about, but it's shady and illegal and involves you in some way, shape, or form. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  You guys had stolen a liver or something?  Yeah, it's always something like that.  Well, you were there in New York the night that the Miami cops showed up.  Yeah.  From a different situation.  Wait, what happened there?  Some detectives.  They wanted to see New York.  But they wanted to be connected.  And that's, you know, one of those Al Pacino's where you're never quite out.  Right.  Even though you're trying to explain to them, hey, good news, I'm all cleaned up.  Yeah, right. 
[01:39:00]  Whatever.  It's been years.  I haven't even seen it.  What was that story about?  Who knows?  It's always a mystery.  That's what it is with him.  It's always some kind of mysterious thing, but you know it was just bad and involved massive amounts of cocaine.  Let's go to, who's this from Long Island?  Samoan woman.  Oh, what's up?  Everything's great today.  Number 11778 reporting.  Oh.  Look at that.  Hi, Ron. 
[01:39:30]  Hi, Fez.  I want to be the first to say hi.  That's all.  Thank you very much.  Well, you're the second or third.  I'll see you soon.  All right.  That's all she wants to say.  Jeff in Jersey.  What's up, Jeff?  Jeff.  Name's probably wrong.  All right.  Let's go to Julian in New Jersey.  Julian.  Big ass call 2346.  They all remember.  Hooah.  Punch it out.  Your mom's box.  All right.  A lot of people excited.  Guys, we're so happy to be back, aren't you? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  I forgot about this part of it.  Yeah, this part of it.  These awful salutations.  Just wanted to say welcome back.  Click.  Shitheads.  We've been taking Northern Virginia calls, so believe me, it's not so bad.  We're numb to it now.  How did the New York listeners keep in touch?  Everybody has these underground feed things.  You know, that's the other weird thing that Bob was calling us about, is that the websites  have blown up so much that any time anything would be posted on Whackbag or DCR TV, the 
[01:40:30]  company would be mad and come back to us like we gave an interview to the New York  Times or something.  Yeah.  And I'm like, you...  Because it's website speculation.  Right.  We can't stop people from writing stuff.  Bob actually said to me on a phone call, do you think you can control your minions?  We should just have all our listeners call Bob all day.  No, leave Bob alone.  What's Bob sound like? 
[01:41:00]  I do a great impression of his secretary.  Which one?  Dawn, I think.  I never get through that crushing board.  Hey, we're trying to get Jim Norton to raise.  I'm working on ManCal.  Are you really, you fucking ghoul?  Help!  Actually, Bob is representing my dad now.  It's just that his opportunity...  Last time I saw him, he had a phone book.  I was just calling people randomly.  Do you have representation?  I'd like to be there for you. 
[01:41:30]  You need it.  Well, even as a deli clerk, you should have somebody...  Yes, Bob.  Somebody has to tell Bob he doesn't have to represent every small morning show in America.  Every one of them.  Holy crap.  I'm with him.  He's taking phone calls from this little morning show in the middle of, like, Omaha.  It's such a conflict of interest.  Because they have a little problem with their vacation time.  It's a conflict of interest.  He's supposed to...  There were times where he'd be...  We'd go, dude, play hardball with Infinity or Clear Channel.  Go in there and beat the shit out of these guys and get us the deal we want. 
[01:42:00]  Well, I gotta kind of be calm because I got a guy that I want to get put in Memphis.  And if I push too hard on this...  Like, we give a shit about the guy you're putting in Memphis.  Just represent us.  Where's the big 10% coming from?  10, 20.  Isn't it great?  The team shows?  He gets one price.  Yeah, you'll be splitting this amount.  And I'll be getting 10% from both of you.  How does that work?  Well, it's still just 10%. 
[01:42:30]  How does that work?  10% from...  He's getting 20% of everything.  No, he's getting 10%.  He's getting 10%.  He's getting 10% from me.  Yeah.  That's 10% of half.  10% from you.  Yeah.  And 10% from Opie.  10% of half.  That's still 10%.  That's 20% of the whole thing.  No.  The professor has made a method.  And you've said that many times.  And until Ron said that, I just nodded my head stupidly.  Good point, Ron.  Good point.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Anthony's right.  We're getting ripped off.  10% of the entire thing. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  Yeah.  It's still 10%.  It's still 10% even if you split it in half.  Sure.  Of course it is.  Because you're only getting half.  He's getting 10% of your half.  That's 5%.  That's all.  All these years you've been mumbling, Joe, motherfucker.  I love Anthony's...  I love Anthony's math, though.  Come on.  I love that.  I'm going with the Anthony math.  5% each.  I'm going with the Anthony math.  Because if you double it...  10% of him, 10% of me, I mean, time 20.  That's half the money, for Christ's sake.  That's hysterical.  Oh, what a complete idiot. 
[01:43:30]  And why bring up religion?  Where does that come from?  Ant, come on.  Let's go to Paul in North Carolina.  Paul, what's up?  Hi, Ron.  Hi, Fez.  Hi, Paul.  I was wondering if you guys are going to get Brian Regan in the studio now that you got  the Afro show and try to make him uphold his title for Funniest Man.  Excuse me.  I beat out Brian Regan for Funniest Man that night.  Thank you.  In the enema comedy challenge.  That's right.  That was a good one. 
[01:44:00]  The least funniest in the room.  Took the title.  That was...  You made a demonatrix cry out.  Oh, that was the same day.  I had a great night with Ron and Fez.  I don't know what the line was, but yeah, he lost his bowels on the...  I forgot what the line was, too.  I think anybody could have, you know...  Oh, come on.  Give me a little credit.  I'm funny every once in a while.  I understand, but I mean, in that situation, you know...  He was ready to blow.  He took about three-quart enema, then he had to stand there by people...  In a kiddie pool.  In a kiddie pool.  In a shame in a kiddie pool. 
[01:44:30]  And then there was a dominatrix in there that Opie made cry also.  Well, it was your big show, and I came in just to say hi.  I was drunk, because everyone was drunk back then.  And then there came the line, hey, look, Aunt Joey Ramone.  Is that what he lost it on?  No, that's...  No, the dominatrix.  Oh, what line did he actually...  There was two things going on.  Yeah, the naked guy in the kiddie pool with the enema.  And then you had the dominatrix.  They had this big show planned.  I said one dumb line about how she looked like Joey Ramone.  Yeah, she started crying. 
[01:45:00]  And she cried and ran out, and next thing you know, you guys had to fill an hour because of me.  Yeah, it was an awful night.  I got the...  She had to leave.  I got the big moment, but these guys had to fill the rest of that hour.  When's the last time we were all on the air together, though?  That was the night you got fired, right?  Was it?  Yeah, you came running in with Bob.  I remember we couldn't talk.  Yeah, you couldn't talk.  That stunk.  That wasn't being on the air.  Bob was all disheveled.  Yeah, Bob was actually stunk from flop sweat.  He did.  I was standing next to him, and he was just totally freaked out. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, you know he was trying his darndest, but it just wasn't panning out.  By the way...  All the phone calls.  It's about three years.  Wow.  Yeah, three years.  In a week, it'll be three years that we did the sex with Sam.  Really?  Thing, yeah.  Yeesh.  We should celebrate.  Yeah, do it again.  Let's try that one again.  Three years ago.  Maybe sex with Sam.  We could bring that intern in and all rape him and laugh.  You know what's really weird, too, about getting back together is I remember sex with Sam. 
[01:46:00]  We did some gig or something right after with Joe's band.  Was there one of the U2 bands or something?  At the Hard Rock?  Right.  And your sister that night was saying, I know all you guys are going to get back together again.  And I'm thinking, oh, how sweet.  Because it just doesn't happen.  It doesn't work like that.  Right.  I'm just like, let me mourn.  I know what happens in radio.  It's radio.  You just, people go away.  They leave and you never see them again. 
[01:46:30]  Rockin' Ribs.  That's right.  Very good, Eric.  Was that the one?  Rockin' Ribs.  Yeah.  So.  I remember I went to the Halloween party over at the Hard Rock.  And we'd been off the air for about a month, two months or whatever it is.  And I had gone and they wouldn't let me in.  They wouldn't let me.  I was so frustrated.  I'm going to a Ron and Fez event.  It's the Halloween thing.  Your brother's playing.  My brother's playing and I was having trouble getting in at the door and security was pushing  me around.  They wouldn't let me come back to say hi to you guys.  I was just hanging out there like one of the Minion. 
[01:47:00]  And I couldn't even get back.  It was so frustrating to be back in the pit.  Doing costume changes on Halloween trying to get in the door.  Well, what was the gig that we came up to in New York and you stopped by and they yanked  our cord from us, from D.C.  Oh, that's right.  Anthony comes in.  Oh, right.  Everybody starts to.  You know, we're just a bunch of New York people were hanging out.  We're on the air down there.  And people were chanting Anthony.  And somebody down there just yanked the cord out. 
[01:47:30]  Yep.  They were saying ONA.  An ONA chant got going.  And yeah, Infinity pulled it.  Whoever the PD was, I guess, down there.  Yeah.  They just hate us to this day.  Yeah, they're not crazy about you.  They're not crazy about you.  But you know what?  It wasn't our problem that day.  You talk about the dump buttons.  We had three guys on the dump buttons that day.  Yeah.  Al Dukes was one of them.  And they decided not to use him.  Great job.  Who's moved up in the Infinity Food chain.  Yes, we've heard.  Is he over at K-Rock now?  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  No, he's off that.  He's working corporate.  I thought he was Booker's.  No, that's over.  That's over?  Yeah.  He keeps moving up in the world.  Was that Booker's choice?  No, I think Al is basically being groomed to take over the company.  Well, he'd make a perfect fit.  It would work for us because we've got so much audio of him pissing himself, making out with guys.  Crying under a console. 
[01:48:30]  That's not what we're looking for in an executive.  I know.  That's what killed me when you guys had Cowhead on the other night.  That's the night I met him that Al had his arms around his buddy Cowhead.  They made me kiss a man.  Right.  They made me kiss a man.  That's when he broke my foosball table.  Yeah.  He tipped it over outside because you guys had him blindfolded and drunk and said that there was a hot chick that wanted to make out with him.  And he kissed and it was a guy.  Nobody said tongue, Al.  And who wouldn't see that coming? 
[01:49:00]  Come on.  Who the hell is going to...  No, we're going to blindfold you.  And this is a hot chick.  What a doltz.  That was Al.  All right.  Let's go back to the phones.  They're just going nuts here.  Dave in North Carolina.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, ONA.  Good morning, little Jimmy.  I just want to call and say, hi, Ron and Fez.  It's great to hear you.  Last time I heard you guys was Ron and Ron show. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, wow.  Let the puppies breathe.  Let the puppies breathe.  Thanks.  What does that mean?  Punch it out, guys.  Let your tits out.  It was back when that was really considered shocking and on the edge.  Of course.  It's like whatever people go, remember that shocking bit you guys did?  And of course, now it just seems like nothing.  When someone got their nipple pierced.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  All just pierced it.  I remember that at AAF, though.  We could do that in Boston.  It's like, yeah, this girl's going to come in. 
[01:50:00]  Whoa, she's piercing her nipple.  Oh, my God.  This is outrageous.  Oh, my God.  The nipple.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Any listeners out there with ether and ammonia, please come down to the studio.  We need ether, ammonia.  This was the real gimmick, and I wish it wasn't true, but it happened.  And the winner to the trip to England is my Coke dealer.  My Coke dealer is going to see. 
[01:50:30]  Wow.  Two months in a row, he won the fly away.  What a trip to see the who in London or something.  Because something happened four o'clock in the morning in a titty bar  where he's handing in a bag and goes, I swear, you're going.  You go there.  It's there.  You're going to meet Townsend.  It's perfect. 
[01:51:00]  And that Plagola thing is all the rage.  Right, right.  It's all the rage nowadays.  With Elliot Spitzer here in New York.  You've got to watch Elliot Spitzer here in New York.  His prime directive is going after radio shows for some reason.  His big thing was the payola.  He was going after that.  And not even like the old school payola where you're getting actual money  to play records.  Right.  It's like an advertiser gives a prize away.  You play the record, give the prize away, like a concert ticket or something.  And he's all outraged that that's payola. 
[01:51:30]  And now he's in the paper today.  One of the stations was having a contest, a bitch slap contest.  It's Rick's old station.  Rick's old station.  Hot 97.  Hot 97.  Smack Fest 05.  And I watched these online and it's brilliant.  I loved it.  They had two bitches standing in front of each other.  Big fat black rods.  And they would take turns smacking each other as hard as they possibly can in the face.  And I guess whoever took it the longest would win the prize.  And Elliot Spitzer said this is a combat contest that had to be sanctioned by rules like boxing 
[01:52:00]  and fined the station $250,000 for just standing there and smacking.  What's the problem?  They want to come in and smack each other?  Yeah, I understand.  Way to make a little money.  And now they have to have weigh-ins from the commission.  Right.  Before they can do it.  Get their blood pressure checked.  Yeah, we can't get the people searched in the subways without people chiming in.  But, you know, at least Elliot Spitzer's working so fat bitches can't smack each other  at a radio station.  Priorities are just perfect.  Thank God we're safe from that. 
[01:52:30]  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max, what's up?  Bo and A.  Hi.  What's up there, little Jimmy, you hairless little muggle?  Ron and Fez, never heard of him.  I'm reading.  All right?  Never heard of him.  Fuckers make me laugh.  Punch it out, Maverick.  All right.  It's a great show, man.  Yeah, we highly recommend you check out Ron and Fez.  When are you guys starting?  Like in a month or something?  About a month or so.  Yeah.  Going to take it easy.  Yeah.  Going to take it easy.  Got to find a place.  Right.  Find a place, which is a nightmare right now.  Right now.  The big radio move. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  And it's expensive, of course.  I was talking with the realtor last night.  And the main thing to do is you can get a cheaper place if you're willing to look out  your window and not see a white person.  But for every white person you see, the rent comes way up.  It goes up.  Yeah.  That's true.  I've learned that myself.  So, a month away, that's kind of weird for us, though.  Yeah.  Just a little less vacation than the president.  You guys, what's the longest you've taken off so far, though, between gigs? 
[01:53:30]  It's probably this, right?  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  When the Ron and Ron show went down, we took, what, like six months off?  Wow.  Six months.  Ooh.  Ooh.  There's a long time.  We did that in our sleep.  How long will you guys fall together?  Two years.  26 months.  Really?  Two years.  Jimmy knows the best.  26 months.  26 months.  Four days and seven hours.  Must be nice to get paid.  Shut up.  1,200 awful commercial radio stations around the country plugging my gigs and having 80 
[01:54:00]  people show up.  It stunk.  And thank you to Ron and Fez, by the way, guys, who were true friends through the whole  thing, helping me out.  I love you guys so much.  Thank you.  I don't know how Jimmy was the only one that snuck around and was able to go on  infinity shows, on your shows.  He was an integral part of the Opie and Anthony show.  And he goes, meanwhile, you know, the likes of a big Kev wasn't allowed on your show.  Oh, that was our choice.  Oh, okay.  Now it makes sense.  Jimmy flew under the radar. 
[01:54:30]  That's what's wrong with you at the building.  He flew under the radar that whole time.  It was amazing.  Slithered, probably a better word.  All right, why don't we take a break and we'll get into some things with Ron and Fez.  Because we got fired.  Unless you're a Toronto bitch in a hot pool.  In a hot tub.  Hot pool.  In a hot tub.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Watch Jimmy work in his moves.  I've never seen him before.  I got to watch him.  We went to the spa up by the pool at the hotel in L.A. 
[01:55:00]  And there was a very attractive girl there from Toronto.  She was about, what, 20?  22, maybe 23.  Tall.  Very tan.  Brunette.  Wearing a bikini.  Nice belly.  Very nice body on her.  22.  That's a little young, Jimmy.  She's all alone.  I was thinking just the opposite.  And she was alone.  And Jimmy, you know, sparks up a little conversation.  And she seemed kind of interested in what they were talking about.  But you kind of, you're almost like an interrogation, I noticed.  You're right.  If I could critique your pitch a little bit. 
[01:55:30]  Like, it wasn't conversation.  It was more like you're asking questions, and you're expecting it to lead somewhere.  God damn it.  It was Ant.  It was his chick.  It was two other ladies.  Like, one lady and her daughter from Colorado and me and this hot chick.  And you're right.  That's exactly what I do.  Toronto.  You live by the tower.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, fuck.  Like a mental checklist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The same question you get asked in Guantanamo.  Yeah.  Are you now a homosexual? 
[01:56:00]  God damn it.  You're right.  I interrogate them, and it's going somewhere.  And then, you know, but we're all kind of laughing and talking.  And then, out of nowhere, she just goes, well, I got to go, and gets up.  I gave myself a wake, and I mumbled, whore.  I'm sitting in the hot tub with my feet in the hot tub, but I don't want my fat tits to hang out,  so I leave my Aussie shirt on at the hot tub.  Yeah, you were, like, fully clothed.  Exactly.  37 with an Aussie shirt, no self-esteem.  Little fat calves in the water.  Just dangling your little feeties in there.  So, do you like Canada? 
[01:56:30]  Fine.  Bye.  Give me a cast and a couch and a van.  That'll fish you.  It's 90 degrees.  When she said, it's getting a little chilly, I think I should go in.  I should have told you.  Come to New York often, man.  The girl from Canada is cold in L.A.  God damn it.  You're right.  That's what I do in interrogation.  It was the cold fear that just ran up and down her spine.  Oh, yeah.  I started asking questions like, do you wear contact lenses, eyeglasses?  How good are you at, like, identifying facts? 
[01:57:00]  Have you ever spoken to the police before?  Do you have a visa?  All right.  We got Bob Sager coming in at 9.30.  We should take a break.  Yeah.  And we should talk to these guys about what happened after we got fired, because we left  them behind.  They took over pretty much at any time.  Well, we want to get into that, because there was a picture on the Post that made me laugh  so hard when I was basically really depressed during that whole time, but I got a really  huge laugh the day they were on the front page of the Post with this awful publicity photo  of the Daily News. 
[01:57:30]  Daily News, yeah.  We've got to find that picture.  All right.  We have to find that.  We'll try to do that, and we'll continue.  This is Aaron Schick, World Wrestling Federation three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  It's a pleasure for me today, Anthony, and I hope you bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans, and everybody know I'm the real Middle Eastern man.  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world, Manhattan, Madison, 
[01:58:00]  Surrey Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American.  And also my Iranian friend, Khidmat Hamish and Wendagana, Iranian Aziz, salamaz me-kunam.  All the world, Aaron Schick, Khosrow, Waziri, R-Mishistan.  Pleasure for me to I come back here again one more time to I talk to the Ophian and Anthony, 
[01:58:30]  and pleasure for me always.  Ophian Anthony, XM202.  I'm going to give you a did you know.  Did you know you can have your computer fixed over the Internet?

The E.M. and Anthony Show.  You'll always find the way to keep me right here waiting.  You'll always find the words to say to keep me right here waiting. 
[02:00:30]  If you chose to walk away, I'd still be right here waiting.  Searching for the things to say to ride here waiting.  Yeah, I love seeing the newbies.  You guys are like newbies.  What was that?  I blinked and we're back.  A lot of feds have been doing radio forever, but as far as satellite radio goes, you guys have a lot to learn.  You're newbies. 
[02:01:00]  They're like, wait, you're back already?  Work, boy.  There are no breaks.  That's right.  Right now, normally, I'd smoke a full cigar during my breaks.  It's nine and a half minutes.  Of course.  We walk outside.  We make calls.  We used to play foosball games and drink, and it was a party going on during the commercial breaks, and it would last forever.  You could smoke.  You could play a full game of foosball up to 11 and go back in and do the show. 
[02:01:30]  That's the weird thing about commercial radio.  The better you got, the less radio you had to actually pay.  That's true.  That's exactly true.  The goal was to do no radio and have everyone think you did a show.  When we first started at WNEW, they were doing five-minute stop sets, maybe.  Yeah.  And then when we were at the peak of our success on commercial radio, they were like 15 to 17 minutes at a time.  We had to do less radio.  It was amazing.  You could just walk out of the studio and have a life.  It's so funny.  We knew we only had two minutes, but we're used to this now. 
[02:02:00]  We take our time going to take a leak.  I went to get my yogurt, and the panic in you guys' faces.  Oh, sometimes the song's over.  We're on.  He's not back yet.  Jimmy's not back.  Jimmy leaves during the show.  He'll go to the office to check email or something if he thinks a chick has emailed him a nude picture.  If you're just tuning in, we got Ron and Fez doing the show with us today, and we couldn't be happier.  They are joining 202 in the very near future.  The first golden ticket. 
[02:02:30]  We started this golden ticket thing.  By the way, that you-have-a-message sound that kept going in the last break, that was my phone.  Okay.  Now, I never – I didn't even check because I would never even think someone would be so stupid as to text message me during the show because we're doing a show.  So, that goes to my sister Dawn.  Thank you, Dawn.  You're the idiot today.  She emailed – see, she goes, see, Ron remembered. 
[02:03:00]  That's what she – she text messaged me.  It's true.  Ron remembered.  Thanks, Dawn.  Bring.  Bring.  Bring.  I almost started crying that night when she said that, though.  Yeah.  Oh, you all work together again.  Yeah, right.  Sure, we will.  Sure.  Yeah.  It just doesn't pan out.  It never happens.  Now, look.  Yeah.  We're all together.  You guys, we're building the fuck-o list.  Do you have any shows you want to add to the fuck-o list that we haven't added yet?  Hitler.  I'd like to see Hitler on that list. 
[02:03:30]  Any radio shows out there that you have a problem with?  You know what?  Actually, I was thinking of golden tickets.  It's – the fact is, Eric Logan, a girl that I got started in radio – I didn't even know  this until recently – is the godmother of his child.  Really?  Yeah.  B-L – she used to do Hooters on the radio.  What's the –  Yeah, then it became the sports chicks, and now it's just the chicks, I think.  Just to let you know about this woman, she was the second Hooters girl hired. 
[02:04:00]  That's how far back she goes.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I like seeing John Glenn talk about the shuttle today.  She's the John Glenn of Hooters chicks.  The second Hooters chick?  Yeah.  What year was that?  I think it was 45.  We just – it was right after VJ.  She was being dipped in Times Square, and a sailor was kissing her.  The returning soldiers love wings.  Oh, boy. 
[02:04:30]  That's not a title you want to tell too many people about.  I was the second Hooters girl ever.  The first one, Cloris Leachman.  God rest his soul.  It's like saying you're the second woman with the right to vote in this country.  She's the world's oldest man.  With surviving –  Suffrage.  Civil War bride.  I was the first woman to legally wed a Negro. 
[02:05:00]  When was that law passed?  I don't know.  I don't like it.  Oh, my God.  People, people.  Bro versus Wade.  Hey, since we are going to be off a month, though, Opie, I want to see if you guys can push this for us.  Yeah.  If anybody knows what we want to do, I wanted to set up a hotline for people to call us.  It's 703-449-0898, 703-449-0898. 
[02:05:30]  Call us.  Leave any kind of gay bashing that you want on that number.  Wait a minute.  Say that number again.  703-449-0898.  That is my home phone number.  In Northern Virginia.  That is my home phone number, Ron.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That is.  703-449-0898.  Shit.  God.  Whoops.  Now that's out.  Yeah, that's going to leave a brew, so.  Take it. 
[02:06:00]  It's more like a golden shower now.  Well, hopefully it will be for you.  So, can we talk about the publicity shot that made it on the cover of the Daily News after we got fired?  Well, you know, there's so much.  I remember I was doing some inline skating, trying to get my mind off.  Of course you were.  Stop it.  Off the hell that we were in.  We all know you're in shape, Opie.  I remember that day.  The sun came up.  We breathed air, and I was rollerblading.  Just making that body better.  We were syndicated 20 cities.  We lost it all in one day, doing our Sex for Sam thing, and we get fired. 
[02:06:30]  And we're, you know, all over the front pages of a ton of newspapers.  The press was so desperate.  They wanted to keep the story going.  Right.  What happened.  And it was, like, so much fun in a lot of ways because we would show up to work.  You know, we were the only show left at NAW.  Plus all the bosses were fired.  Everybody was out of it.  Everybody was fired.  And we got this big dark floor with one little light bulb at the end. 
[02:07:00]  That was us.  Everyone on our staff had their own huge office.  Yeah.  We've got to explain this to the rest of the country.  They were building this pretty amazing radio station.  You know, they had us.  They had Ron Efez.  They had Scott Pharrell there.  And they took a lot of time to get some really good talk shows together.  They were really trying to build it up and make every day part fun and exciting.  And we had just turned the corner.  Right.  Like, Jeremy had just taken us out to dinner because we had some kind of number one with 
[02:07:30]  men numbers.  And he was all whatever.  The ratings were turning around.  Yeah.  And then the company was taking notice.  And they were going to try to syndicate this whole thing to a lot of stations across America.  Yeah.  And then we fucked up so bad that we get fired.  Our whole staff gets fired.  They fire Ken Stevens, the guy that put the whole radio station together.  Jeremy and others.  Jeremy took you to dinner.  The Ramrod has a lovely burger.  Jimmy's a little bitter because he was supposed to get a raise. 
[02:08:00]  No, my money was supposed to double.  Yeah.  Right.  He was supposed to double.  That's a good raise.  His money was going to double.  And the paperwork was in.  No, it wasn't.  And that was the problem.  He didn't put the paperwork in.  Slow.  He took his time with the paperwork.  Took his time with the paperwork.  Didn't put it in.  So then when Jimmy got the boot, all that severance pay that he was supposed to get was based  on the old rate.  Instead of the new rate.  Jeremy decided to take his time.  Other things were a little more important.  I still have the contract with the new figure on it.  Signed by John Sykes, I believe.  I would have done your contract, but I was busy holding two beautiful black things. 
[02:08:30]  I really get it.  Yuck.  Everything's neat and organized.  It's a little compartmentalized.  Just shaming mother.  Shaming her.  Well, after you guys got blown out, the press went so crazy that there for a while, like,  we would show up for work to try to get in the doors.  And it was like I was O.J.'s lawyer.  There would just be people taking pictures at TV cameras.  And I'd have my kid with me.  And I'd be like this.  No comment. 
[02:09:00]  No comment at all.  Just playing the gimmick like I had anything to say.  What could I possibly say?  What do you have to say about St. Patrick's?  Any word at all?  What's happening with the boys?  Everybody was just that.  Excuse me.  Mr. Bennington.  I get five minutes.  You know?  So just every day was like a madhouse.  And then one day, I get up in the morning, check my email, and the little radio section  of the Daily News was, and it was some kind of a stupid thing because they decided we were 
[02:09:30]  replacing you.  Yeah.  Even though we'd been there the whole time, the Daily News just took an angle of, these  guys are going to take over.  For the devils.  Yeah, right.  Like, the cancer hasn't been killed.  Right.  Right.  And there was no reason.  We hadn't moved into your shift.  The press found a new tumor, and it was Ron Fens.  And, you know.  So they thought the radiation worked.  And it was weird because we had a meeting that day with the boss, and I see this whacked 
[02:10:00]  out, coked out picture of us from years before.  I had dreadlocks and a do-rag on my head.  Fezzy's wearing a half shirt with his big hairy belly hanging out.  And a feather boa.  A feather boa.  Rattling tights.  We had went through a long period where we thought dyeing our hair and wearing costumes  was funny.  I don't know why.  You know what I mean?  It was all caught up in the moment.  They were comfortable.  I know why. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Well, it was the late 90s.  Everything was different.  It was a different time, man.  It was pre-steps.  It was pre-steps.  The first Gulf War had ended.  So, I had called Fez.  I go, Fez, you're not going to believe this.  There's some little article about us in the Daily News.  And there's a picture.  And it's just dead air from him on the phone.  And he's like, is it bad?  And I'm like, yeah.  Aren't you always hoping against all hope that when there's a picture in the paper, it's 
[02:11:00]  going to be a good one?  But it never is.  The weird thing about it is, since I had only got it online, I thought it was just the little  radio section they run.  And I had no idea it was the front page of the Daily News.  So, Fez and I, we had to go down and see somebody from Infinity that day.  We were down at 1313.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  On Broadway.  Yeah.  So, we're going through that office.  And they're like, hey, it's really screwed up.  I'm like, hey, whatever. 
[02:11:30]  Who knows?  It's awful what they did to you.  Hey, forget about it.  It'll be forgotten tomorrow.  We have no idea.  It's the cover.  So, we're walking down the street, seeing people we know.  And they're busting up, laughing, pointing at us.  All the people, the security at N.E.W. laughing at us.  And we're going to have no idea why.  And I'm going, everybody reads the little radio section.  Everyone goes to page 50.  What's the big deal?  The last second, John Minnelli shows us the picture right before we're going to go 
[02:12:00]  in the air.  Hands us the paper.  And there it is on the cover.  And it felt like someone just had a picture of your asshole on the cover.  It's just like, you couldn't have been more exposed.  And it wasn't clean.  It just pulled your cheeks apart.  It wasn't the headline, the next Dumb and Dumber, or the next Opie and Dopey.  Yeah.  It was something like that.  Something cruel.  Here they come.  It made me laugh so freaking hard. 
[02:12:30]  The weird thing is, I'm sure that wasn't like any press picture.  I have no idea.  It was like from a Christmas party.  Christmas party or something.  Yeah.  They got that from the party that David Ferry and Clay Shaw were at together.  You're a handsome man, Mr. Bennington.  Oh, man.  Well, hey, any publicity, right?  No.  No.  No.  No.  That's just not true.  We learned that one.  Covering your face as you go past newsstands. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  As a stack of them sit there.  It's awful.  Someone's got to send the link.  We want to read that article today.  I was driving after I got fired, and we were on the cover of the papers, and there was a  bus passing me by as I was driving, and the other lane was a bus, and you know, the drivers  put the newspapers down into their windshield, a little well down there, and plain as day,  I look over and just see my face, and Opie's, of course, and Opie and Dopey as the headline,  and I'm just driving, and I thought to myself, I actually said it out loud.  I went, I'm Dopey. 
[02:13:30]  The front page of the New York papers.  You're lucky his name is in front.  The weird thing is, like, that happens in movies to people, but never in real life.  No.  You know, that's always like, oh, look, you know, everyone's mad at Kramer, and then  life moves on.  Right.  But this one just hung there.  It just hung like an ugly fog above everyone. 
[02:14:00]  I know that guy.  Morning.  Mr. Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  He just walks in.  That's great.  How you doing, man?  How are you, sir?  I'm sorry.  You have some.  Yeah.  That plane ride better.  Do you want me to go somewhere?  No.  No, no, no.  We just got to get you a microphone.  Hang out.  Do we have a seat?  Do we have a seat for Mr. Saget, please?  It's a very full studio today.  You guys got 18 producers, and not one of them moves.  It's a very full studio today, so please stow your bags underneath the seats.  We're in the overhead compartments.  We were going to set you up real nice after the break, but sit down and enjoy the party. 
[02:14:30]  How about having a mic that works?  Yeah, the mic's not working yet.  This is way new.  There you go.  There it is.  Give me an RF.  All right, Bob, let me set the scene for you.  Opie, Anthony, that's Ron and Fez, who we just hired to be on our channel 202, and little  Jimmy Norton.  You know Jimmy.  I know Jimmy Norton.  I've seen his balls.  And we go way back.  Yeah, all the way to the plane.  To the bizarro plane.  Plane from hell.  Like Fellini Satyricon was shot, and he chopped off a woman's arm. 
[02:15:00]  That really was odd.  It started out odd because with the female Asian pilot with the yellow black hair.  That's what I'm getting off.  That's what I said.  I don't stay off.  When do you get off the plane?  Like there's got to be a line where I'm going, I'm not flying on this plane.  You always hear about people that leave, and then all of a sudden the plane goes down,  and I was on that plane.  When do you actually get up and leave?  Is it when an Asian woman with multicolored hair gets in the cockpit?  That's anime.  At that point it's anime.  It was anime.  In her hair I got off.  Apparently that changes the color. 
[02:15:30]  Looking for Waldo in her hair.  It was awful.  And then she walks in, and I go, please turn right when you get in there.  Please go to the right.  She thought you said turn on the light.  You know how they call them.  You know them.  As opposed to the Jews.  It was an evil flight.  She said we attack at midnight.  Actually, I don't know.  When she was saying, please turn your overhead.  Tora, Tora, Tora.  Go on the whole line.  That was the Jew in the front.  Climb Mount Nataki.  And she turned to the right and sat in the co-pilot's seat. 
[02:16:00]  So I'm like, okay, at least she's not flying the thing.  And then worse, the short Mexican guy with a black eye is the pilot.  I did that too with my dick.  I hit him right in the eye.  I finished in her hair and then stuck it in his eye.  Then he went and got some guac in my cock.  I'm sorry, you put me on XM.  I'm very relieved to be here.  Go ahead.  Sorry, you guys got to finish up.  It worked.  I got tons to talk about when you're ready.  That's okay.  So that's what's why on the plane. 
[02:16:30]  Now, I'm thinking the same thing.  You know, do you leave?  Do you get off?  No.  Well, you put your faith in our death.  In our death.  In our death.  In our death.  In our death.  In our death.  In our death.  And then, I got to tell you, it was, I felt better when you got on the flight.  Right.  Because I'm like, Bob Saget can't die in a plane crash.  No, no.  But then the order of our names.  Well.  Depends on your ratings that morning.  I was done.  No.  When I saw you get on the plane, I knew any mention of me was done.  That's not true.  And then Leslie Ann Warren gets on.  Right.  And now, I'm not even getting, I'm just going to be the picture of my sneaker floating if 
[02:17:00]  we go in over the water or something.  I don't even get a mention.  It's nothing.  It doesn't say radio personality for you.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah.  Shamed radio personality.  I wouldn't even get shamed.  They wouldn't say that.  They'd say hit XM radio personality.  Nothing.  It's all new now.  It's Bob Saget.  Well, Leslie Ann.  It's Cinderella.  We just find her slipper.  We were arguing who would have gotten top billing over you or Leslie Ann Warren.  Your ice pack would have been floating. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, Leslie Ann Warren.  She got hit.  She was picking up her cat on the way to leave.  She told me this, and I believe her.  And she fell.  She went to kiss her cat.  She fell on her cat's cock.  And it put her eye out.  And then she put the cat out.  Now, she fell on something.  Like, I don't know, a bottle of whiskey.  No, I don't know what she fell on.  And she bruised herself.  So, she's on the plane with an ice pack.  Yeah, there's Leslie Ann Warren now with an ice pack on her head.  Very pretty lady.  And she's not, you know, 20.  No, she's no kid.  She's way past my dating range.  Yeah.  Apparently so. 
[02:18:00]  I'm dating her granddaughter.  No, I'm dating.  I'm dating someone that hasn't been born yet.  A little John Bonnet Warren.  A little stem cell.  Stem cell with lipstick.  Take off the cowboy hat.  I want a blowjob.  Let me rest my balls on your stirrup.  I got a foot fetish.  Take off your stirrups.  You're going to shred them.  But she's very sweet, by the way.  I talked to her.  She has very nice luggage.  Expensive luggage.  I didn't even see her luggage.  I noticed that.  I don't know about her baggage, but she had luggage.  I noticed you hiding. 
[02:18:30]  Bob was hiding behind one of the poles.  I had to.  These kids come over and go.  I saw them stalking you.  You signed my autograph.  Yeah, you cut my balls.  Oh my God.  My daughter wants to meet you.  That's fine.  He's trying to be a little...  You have an older kid?  I need a hand-duke.  Because people...  You are one of the most recognized people ever.  It's like being in a fucking Big Bird outfit.  It is.  You might as well be.  I know.  It's horrible.  Hi, everybody.  Hi, I'm gangly and tall.  And your father hated my jokes on the video show.  Come here. 
[02:19:00]  I'll tell you to fuck off.  But I'm nice to people.  I'm nice to people.  But the problem...  That's it.  Like the dad will come...  It sounds great.  Yeah.  The dad will come over and go,  you know, we like you.  We watch you together as a family.  And then I'll turn to my friend and go,  my daughter looks tight.  And who do I make it out to, honey?  You know what I'm saying?  I'm never rude.  No.  I'm always nice, though.  Oh, God damn.  Our flight was Island of Dr. Moreau.  It was very strange.  The whole plane intermarried.  And he...  So now you're just trying to be a little inconspicuous,  as inconspicuous as you can be.  And then now his limo driver's trying to find him, 
[02:19:30]  holding this huge Saget sign.  Just Saget!  Saget!  Yeah, what was that about?  You can't find him.  And then she just stands next to me and stares at me.  Do you think she's watching a TV?  Well...  You're a tolerant person.  Yeah, your TV's 12 inches tall.  And the guy, the flight attendant gentleman.  That was strange.  Yeah, he came over to say hi to Bob.  Okay.  And then he wouldn't stop asking him to mention his name on television. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  You would think it was one of those passing goofs that people probably do.  Hey, next time you're on TV, say hi.  But this guy was serious.  You do it.  You do it.  You say hi to Bobby.  You do it.  I'll be watching.  I'm going to be watching you.  I hope he's listening today.  He's just screaming.  I know it.  Yeah, I know I can do it.  He's talking about it.  He is.  So then Bob kind of turned around, because I was laughing, and turns around and looks  at me and makes his face like, what a fucking asshole.  And the guy's looking right at Bob.  Yeah, the guy definitely, he was like, wait a minute. 
[02:20:30]  He's making fun of me with his eyes.  Maybe that face ain't for me.  Like he just left.  Just said something ridiculously stupid.  And then I heard.  Guess what the face is for you?  You know, the loading of a rifle.  Yeah.  On a plane.  Fuck that Bob Saget.  I'm going to fuck that Bob Saget.  And as soon as this plane.  Lance.  Yeah, that was a strange one.  That's a good accent we're doing for that guy.  Yeah, I think it was right on.  Right on.  Like Lance in 1960.  We're loaded, Bob Saget.  We're helping the world. 
[02:21:00]  It's like a Rickles joke.  We got a Chinese guy.  A black guy.  I love everyone.  I love Rickles, though.  Hey, we got to go to the phones real fast.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, yo.  What's up, bro?  Hey, we're hanging out with Bob Saget.  I know you are.  Yo, Bob.  Yo, yo.  When you were doing the show with those young Olsen twins.  Yeah, never banged them.  I know.  No, no, no, no.  I was going to say.  Dude, Jimmy, how you doing, buddy?  Okay, thank you, sir.  This guy is so nervous he can't get this out. 
[02:21:30]  You're not holding it, are you, dude?  No, no, no.  Talking to Mr. Tanner.  Oh!  Oh, snake eyes.  I called Mr. Cohen and said, yo, brother.  Dude, you're one of the funniest guys I've ever heard on the radio show.  Oh, thank you, man.  You got Dan, man.  You got the improv thing going on nice.  Oh, thank you, buddy.  Basically, what Kevin wanted to say is, didn't realize Bob was so filthy.  Yeah, I did that show, you know.  I haven't seen Aristocrats yet, Bob.  I'm dirty.  But I heard Ope said you were funny as hell in it, so. 
[02:22:00]  Thank you, man.  Gave your props.  Thank you.  I talk about a lot of nice, a lot of friendly things in it.  We got to get this out of the way.  We didn't blow you off.  That's important, because you know what happened?  I swear to God, that day you called.  Here, I fucked up.  This is bad.  My daughter freaked out.  It was in L.A., and I didn't call.  And how do you not call a guy, a well-known people that I listen to, that I like, right?  You really listen to the show?  I got the XM on the.  Yeah, the Wi-Fi on the plane, yeah.  On the damn plane, dude.  So I'm in.  Should we ask him an Ope and Anthony question?  Yeah, I hear all your listeners go, fuck the president, things like that. 
[02:22:30]  You know, freedom of speech.  So, I'm in.  I'm in.  I don't listen to it too much.  I'm very ADD, you know?  Okay.  Take a sleeping pill on a plane and listen to the soft skit.  You're listening to the loft, where I'm going to dismember you.  But, you know, I thought, and then I called the next day because I was doing some club  in the middle of Butthole America.  Yeah.  And it was a beautiful club, unless I've ever been anywhere.  And, no, it was nice.  But I felt bad, and they put me on hold for like 20 minutes, and I thought it was a blow-off. 
[02:23:00]  No, I forgot what happened.  I always assume it, though, because I'm used to it.  No, no, no, no.  Not at all.  We were excited to talk to you.  Yeah, you didn't call the day, and then you...  You're not all into some big group voodoo lie going on?  No, there was...  I swear to God, no.  There was something going on that day we couldn't just let go of, and I saw you on hold the  whole time, but we just couldn't...  But then I was on the air, and I heard it, and you were talking about the bad reviews on  the Honeymooners, and I went, this isn't...  Oh, that's what it was.  We were doing a whole...  Big news.  No, we were doing a whole...  For us.  Can't let go of that. 
[02:23:30]  That was our huge break of the day.  But I'm here.  I'm here, so...  Bob, that was our big bit that day.  You know, we knew we had 40 minutes on the...  Well, now's Naughton!  We knew we had 40 minutes on the Black Honeymooners.  Where be Trixie?  I can't believe the Honeymooners bombed.  What's her name?  Cute in it.  She's...  I forgot her name.  She's a good actress.  We were so pissed off, though.  Yeah.  No idea.  No, I like her.  Black jet?  Yeah, the one who was in James Williams.  She's good.  She was in Malibu's Most Wanted with James Williams.  Nell Carter.  I was going for Mom's Mabley. 
[02:24:00]  Not Nell Carter.  No, Mom's Mabley had...  She'd take her teeth out.  She'd gum your sack like this.  Go to Mom.  I heard a tape of her and Red Fox, and you couldn't understand a word.  My friend Jeremy Kramer, who's a crazy comedian.  You know, Jeremy?  You've been doing this forever.  He goes...  He used to do a bit of Red Fox and Mom's Mabley.  How you doing, Mom?  You want to see your pussy?  Is it red?  I want to see my pussy.  What is your pussy?  It's my pussy.  My pussy.  My pussy.  You couldn't understand the whole bit.  It's like five minutes of just yelling my pussy at each other. 
[02:24:30]  I think it's brilliant.  Anyway, anyway, I'm happy to be here, because I like you guys, and I like what Satellite Radio  is doing a lot.  Yeah.  I like what you guys are doing.  It's a lot of fun, being able to do whatever the hell you want.  You could say shmegma, and then...  Oh, that's the one thing you can't say.  Oh, no.  So we had to dump out of that.  How about taint?  You could talk about taint?  Taint.  That's the only thing you could say.  See, the feedback is going crazy on the phones.  Everyone is amazed that you're so dirty, Bob.  Well, they can go fuck themselves.  I've always been like this.  30 years of it.  I've always...  Well, now you got the gig on the show, on Full House. 
[02:25:00]  I had to get a job.  I had a new kid, and my ex-wife almost died while I was fucking her.  No, when she gave birth.  When she gave birth.  We've had a lot of death and stuff.  I have two dead sisters and shit.  Jesus.  Well, Jesus died, too, and I'm not responsible for murder.  I didn't know on the cross, was that?  Well, he's dead, but then didn't stay dead.  That's the beauty of it.  That's what I hear.  It's not on the Thomas Guide, exactly.  He's a zombie.  But you must not have known him.  I think they're all in Aruba.  They never found a body.  No.  She's hot, by the way.  Yes.  What's up, Lawrence? 
[02:25:30]  Nothing.  Well, she was hot.  Yeah.  She might be.  You never know where it is.  Let me tell you where the line isn't on this show.  Okay.  We've made light of Adam Walsh's head.  Ah.  So, I really don't...  Well, I'm just trying to give you a ballpark here.  It's wide open.  I was on CNN yesterday.  Penn Jillette was being the director and Penn Jillette of the Aristocrats, and they were putting  us on Showbiz tonight, and they had 45 minutes of Peter Jennings is dead. 
[02:26:00]  We love Peter Jennings.  What a great man.  What a great man.  And now, Bob Saget from the Aristocrats.  Oh, hey.  Be funny.  And I'm like, this is a movie about incest and shitting and pissing on each other.  Yeah.  Where does that fall into the tribute?  And so Penn Jillette's on in Vegas, and he's all happy because he's just, like, cursing  through the IFB before we go on.  You sitting there with an asshole, Bob?  And I'm like, Peter Jennings is dead, dude.  It's a good story.  I'm very relieved to be here where I could talk about this. 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  What is that sound?  I'm hearing something that sounds like a record.  He gave me fucking Engelbert Humperdinck's mic.  It's a wireless mic, and we didn't have batteries for it.  They had to charge him really fast.  It sounded like his wireless mic is going to crap out within 10 minutes.  Oh, that's wonderful.  I don't care.  I'll share with Jim Norton.  I know where his mouth has been.  Sorry if it smells like bleach.  Your mic smells like my cock.  You want to take a call?  I'll talk to somebody.  I got to say, too, the first time I realized that Bob was really dirty was it had half-baked. 
[02:27:00]  Everybody was shocked.  I think the line was something about sucking cocks for coke.  Yeah, I sucked dick for coke.  Yeah.  And the fucking place went crazy.  It was the biggest laugh in the film because nobody expected that to come out of your mouth.  I got honored at Harvard on the basis of that.  Really?  At the Harvard Lampoon and Sanders Theater and 1,200 people.  And they lower a screen, 35-millimeter projection, and run the clip.  And then I did stand-up for like 30 minutes.  They went nuts.  Then I went, oh, these are my people.  So then I started doing stand-up a lot more for theaters.  Some people don't understand.  It's a fucking part you played. 
[02:27:30]  And when that cheesy music starts up and you're giving your little lesson to one of the daughters or something.  You know what?  Hoorah.  Michelle, it's really not good to jack off a horse.  But he's in the living room, Dad.  Ah, you got a point.  I've been blowing the dog.  You know what it is, though?  And I don't blame people.  It was a good show for what it is.  You know, the show's made for 12-year-old girls.  It's a family little show.  There's nothing fucking wrong with that.  You got a 12-year-old at home, you don't want him listening to shit like this and talking about fucking dogs and shit. 
[02:28:00]  Had a little Uncle Jesse on there.  Had a little mullet.  He had his mullet.  Had a little mullet head.  Dave Couillet shaved his balls, which he did.  He had the sting haircut.  The reverse sting Phil Collins.  Whatever, the emperor's ball haircut.  All right.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  Yeah, no worries.  Let's go to the phones.  John, what's up?  Hey, Bob, I've got a question, man.  I saw Dave Couillet perform in my school, and he is a complete hack.  Oh, don't say that about him.  He shaves his balls.  Yeah, but I mean, I don't know. 
[02:28:30]  It was just, he's doing Rocky and Bullwinkle impressions on stage, and I hear you in, like, these movies, and I don't know, man.  Well, I'm not doing that.  I'll do it if I'm fucking Rocky.  Well, Dave, here's something you'll really like.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Winkle, let go of my nuts.  You know, I just, he's a funny, funny guy.  Sometimes I think maybe he chose the wrong material for a college audience.  Maybe, is that what it is?  That's a good one.  Boy, that's diplomatic of you.  I love, Dave's one of my dear friends.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, no, no.  And the thing is, too, you just laugh about your bank accounts from that show, both of you. 
[02:29:00]  Just look and show each other, like me and over here.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Did you guys do that?  Oh.  Why'd you tell those jokes?  Look at this, fucker.  Enjoy your pickup.  Look at this.  It's huge.  No, but I hear you.  But was he funny at all for you?  We got rid of him there.  Oh, good.  Sorry about that.  So good.  Too late.  Steve in New Mexico.  Yeah, right.  Steve.  Hey, what's up, guys?  He throws your buddy under a bus and then leaves.  Yeah, Steve.  Steve, go. 
[02:29:30]  Bob, listening to you is like fucking listening to South Park the first time I watched the movie,  and they come out of that theater and just start cussing up and stuping the funniest shit I ever heard, man.  Oh, that's a big compliment.  Thank you, man.  Yeah, my stand-up's kind of like that.  The aristocrat's too dirty.  The aristocrat's like X-rated or NC-70.  In my stand-up, I had to say fuck a bunch and talk about fucking people's daughters.  Nothing too dirty.  You did Entourage a couple weeks ago.  Playing yourself.  Smoking a bong and banging hookers.  That's life.  I had to show that to my real children just so they know because that's real popular. 
[02:30:00]  Their friends all watch that shit.  I love Entourage.  So I have an 18, 15, and a 12-year-old daughter, and I'm fucking all their friends, and that's not true.  Oh, my God.  And that's not true.  It's just a couple of them.  I'm not fucking their friends.  My 12-year-old, come on.  They haven't even reached their chair yet.  Let's go to Larry in New Jersey.  Larry.  We're going to hell.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Rana Fenn.  Glad to have you back.  Cool.  Bob, I have the opposite thing where it's like everyone's like, oh, my God, you have Danny  Tanner from Full House, and now he's talking about sucking horse cock. 
[02:30:30]  But the other way around, you're on the Young Comedian special.  Yeah, with Rodney.  And you're talking about a seven-year-old giving you a blowjob.  Next thing I see you on Full House, I'm like, whoa.  Right.  Why did he do that?  Yeah.  Well, here's the deal.  I had a job in New York.  First thing I did was a Richard Pryor movie called Critical Condition.  It's the first job I got after nine years of trying to get a job.  And then I got to say fuck in that.  It was an R-rated movie.  And I got to work with Richard Pryor for a month.  So that's like the shit.  And then before that, Rodney Dangerfield mentored me and put me on his Young Comedian 
[02:31:00]  show with Scam Kennison and Louie Anderson and Rita Rudner and all that, those people.  And then I got a job in the CBS Morning program here in New York, and I got fired after five  months.  And you know what it's like.  I got fired, fired.  I had a hosting chair on CBS against Today Show, and I got there one morning, and the chair  was gone.  Oh, wow.  And they went, we'll try to get your chair back.  And so I got a phone call that they wanted to recast the guy in Full House. 
[02:31:30]  And I said, yeah, I mean, I would have fucking signed, I'd have been eating horse shit out  of a guy in the park, you know, out of a man's ass with horse shit coming out of it.  And so I went, I just had a baby here at Lenox Hill, went to L.A., did Full House.  It was, I don't know, said, Felix Unger, I'll hug, you know, I'll be clean, I'll be a neat  freak.  I love how he's got to explain the fact that he's on a huge hit show making massive amounts  of successful shit.  Yeah, but I had a bouffant hairdo, and I was like the gayest guy that ever lived.  And then I did a video show with those jokes from my grandmother's ass.  Right, yeah, that's right. 
[02:32:00]  You're on two huge, two huge shows.  Giant hit, and the jokes traveled around the world, but they wouldn't have if I talked  like my stand-up, because here's a guy getting hit in the dick, enjoy your meal, you know.  Here's an old man getting killed by shrapnel, fuck you.  You can't do that.  So the answer is, you're right.  Watch his cunt get petrified as this man jumps out of a cake.  And the winner is, big fat cunt.  But who will it be?  But that was Ernie Anderson, he died of cancer.  He was P.T. Anderson's dad.  Really?  True thing.  True dad.  Happy story. 
[02:32:30]  Lovely, enjoy it.  Bring it up and have your cereal.  All right, that's good.  You still got on a plane with him.  Yeah, no, really.  That was a guy who just asked a question or made a comment, and I talked for seven minutes.  That's fine.  How many years was his full house on?  Eight.  Jesus.  Let's go to Tennessee.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to ask Bob Saget, when you hosted that show, America's Funniest Home Video, was  that your material, or was that written?  Because I'm telling you, I thought you were garbage, but now sitting here listening to you  speak, I think you're pretty cool, man.  Well, thank you.  Was that your material or what?  It was, this is the truth, I'll just say the truth. 
[02:33:00]  It was written by two skinheads.  No, it was written by two friends of mine that are Canadian.  That's why.  There was like an 18% exchange rate from the joke.  But it was, and myself, I did, I did had, we wrote 55 pages a week.  What I thought I did okay on there was writing the voiceovers to the animals, and I did those  voices, the real shitty ones, like, oh, look out, my balls.  Oh, I remember that.  That was a cat.  Yes, sir, I accept, that was a cat and a squirrel and a goose.  Here I am, chasing my tail, chasing my tail. 
[02:33:30]  Boots in a rock, boots in a rock.  But, sir, Boots in a rock is famous.  But, sir, I feel your pain because I felt it much more, but there's no, I was doing  network TV, and it was either quit the show, which is my option, or try to somehow feed  the box, which is the lowest common denominator, and the show traveled to, like, Spain.  It was like third world, and it went to people that don't even have lives.  In Lebanon, they told me they stopped the war to watch this show. 
[02:34:00]  That's a fucking dumb war if you're going to fight a war and stop it for America's funny.  So, I agree, sir, I felt the same way about this show.  Pushing a rock, pushing a rock.  Blowing it up, blowing it up, putting it back.  But, sorry, sorry, man, I don't know what to tell you.  Pushing a Jew.  Blowing up a Jew.  Eating some flan.  What the fuck's he got flan for?  But I hear, I...  The show's still around.  What?  Why aren't you with the show anymore?  Oh, it's 10 years.  No, they offered me to stay if I would take, like, a third pay cut. 
[02:34:30]  Wow.  And I said, that is an attractive offer.  You're really pulling that over.  And we don't want you to write it.  Oh, that's it.  Well, I don't blame you on that, but still, no.  So, it was...  I wanted to do acting and directing, and I directed some stuff for a few years that didn't become a hit,  like Dirty Work, which is kind of a cult movie.  It's Norm MacDonald's, Chris Farley's last movie.  Would have put Jim in it.  Would have put Jim in it.  You got fucked.  Thank you.  Wait, what happened?  You were supposed to be in that movie?  No.  Well, we talked about you, though. 
[02:35:00]  Did you?  Yeah, we did.  Swear to God.  Oh, wow.  See that?  You didn't even know.  No.  But, uh...  Oh, that's gonna kill him today.  Well, I was going...  When I saw Bob at Caroline's, the person I met him, like, a week ago, after the aristocrats party,  I'm like, I'm gonna go over and see Saget and get a picture with him, because I have my camera.  And it's weird, because he starts going, is that Jim Norton?  Jim, get him over here.  I was like, fuck.  I got all the Adam Dubin movies.  I've seen all your fun, dirty shit.  Yeah, the Sidesplitters.  I laugh at you.  The gynecologist.  Psychologist, yeah.  American Dummy.  I love American Dummy. 
[02:35:30]  American Dummy.  That's Otto and George.  Yeah.  He's got it all together.  Okay, then.  American Doc Cock.  The weirdest thing for me is that compliment, which is, I always hated you and wanted you dead.  Now I like you.  It's like, let me just clear my memory on the fact that I am hated.  Actually, I can't throw up.  That sums up our show right there.  I get it a lot.  That's okay, man.  If people want to do over and let me, I'm funny, the only thing I'm confident in is  I know I'm funny.  That's the only thing I'm confident in. 
[02:36:00]  The rest of it, I can fucking, I can't figure nothing out.  You ever think of doing a DVD and narrating over it, like with stuff that you could do,  like the Rodney King beating, the Reginald King beating?  They made it.  They made it.  Did they really?  They took clips from the video show and faces of death, and they intercut them, and I've  seen it.  They sent it to me, and it's me going, here's something that happens around the house.  And they got the senator that blows his brains out, and they put Zabruder on it, and they  put the shuttle on it, and I stopped.  At first I laughed, but then people in the audience throwing their heads back and shit, 
[02:36:30]  and then I stopped laughing because I can't watch snuff.  I just can't watch it.  I don't like that either.  I can make it, but I can't watch it.  Your snuff's just one take and you're out, you know?  You don't know how to reshoot.  There's no coverage.  No cat party at the end.  Right?  It's just me and a bottle of George Dickel.  I always hated you, but now I want myself to yourself.  Well, you're getting a huge reaction on the phone.  Steven in Atlanta.  Steven, what's up?  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up, guys? 
[02:37:00]  I love you guys.  You guys run.  But, Bob, here's the deal.  It's so hard.  I've been watching you for so long.  It's so hard for me to sit here and listen to you say fuck because it's like having a Muppet curse.  It's like standing here in Big Bird going, oh, fuck you.  Well, but he was a faggot.  I'm not.  No, it's just this is what I've always been like.  Just come see my stand-up or watch.  I'm working on a lot of new TV stuff.  And supposedly they tell me I'm hot right now, but we'll find out.  If that's just 15 minutes of saying fuck.  I'm saying 15 minutes. 
[02:37:30]  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Remember when Saget came back, did a bunch of radio and TV and said fuck, and then he  offed himself?  Hey, Bob, we've got one more question for you.  Yeah, it's 17 inches.  Ah, that's great.  It fit right in my ass, man.  Oh, that's sweet, dude.  Hey, listen.  The Olsen twins, do you want them to call you daddy now?  Well, they don't call me.  They call me Bob.  They text me late at night.  I mean, how hot?  Were they like that hot on the set?  Yeah, nine months old.  They were really hot.  They're sick bastards shaking their diapers. 
[02:38:00]  They really were that old, too, right?  I got four of their diapers still.  I kept them in Tupperware.  Oh.  No, they're actually, it's very odd.  They're like daughters to me.  It's like I don't go, I don't think sexual with them.  People think that because they're attractive girls, but I got an 18-year-old daughter of  my own, and it's all fucked up.  It fucks with my head.  It's like a psychodrama because on the one hand, I'm a dirty bastard, but I'm not really,  but I would be if, you know, I'm culpable.  I'm culpable, but they're hot and sweet, and they're just, they're like daughters to 
[02:38:30]  me, so I protect them a lot.  I love them a lot.  But the other two, you'd fuck.  I banged everybody else on the show.  Jimmy Gibbler and I had a baby.  Let's say hi to Craig in California.  Craig, what's going on today?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  Sweet cheeks.  Hey.  Hey, Bob, I saw you at the last factory in L.A. a few years ago.  Absolutely fucking hilarious.  Thanks, man.  Laughed my ass off.  Thank you.  And the thing is, I heard you do a song about Full House.  Yeah, Danny Tanner was not gay, sung to the tune of the Backstreet Boys. 
[02:39:00]  I want it that way.  It's a Metro disclaimer.  Metro sexual, I mean.  Can we get a copy of that?  No.  No.  No.  I'll do it, but you're going to see it.  I'm either going to...  No, not...  I mean, I'm doing like an HBO special or something.  Okay, all right.  I'm doing like all kinds of shit.  I got 15 minutes.  I better hear you guys.  I'm punching out.  Take it again.  All right.  Let's say hi to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate, what's up?  Sweet cheeks.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Hello?  Go ahead, Nate.  Yeah.  I live working in a pretty classy place in a law office.  I normally have to listen to you guys quietly over my headphones. 
[02:39:30]  I find out Bob Socket's going to be on.  I'm figuring, oh, great.  I'll be able to play this loud.  I come in.  I turn it on.  I got to keep this quiet, though.  I turn it on.  F-S-F-S.  I quickly push the things back in.  You rule, man.  Oh, thank you for keeping me on the PA.  Good for the kids.  Broadcasting it with a truck, an ice cream truck down the street.  Ruined his little day at work.  Can you tell the story of the birth of your daughter?  It's legendary now.  It is true, isn't it?  Is it a true story?  Oh, fuck. 
[02:40:00]  Well, because...  It's really wrong.  I had to call my daughter because it was in the front page of the New York Observer.  Yeah, Paul Provenza told us that we have to ask you.  It has to be told on radio.  Oh, fuck.  Wasn't it Paul Provenza that was...  Paul Provenza, Carrie Snow, a girl named Jackie Green, is a publicist in town, and somebody  else I can't remember.  We had a really rough child of birth with my ex-wife and my first daughter who's now 18,  and we were at Lenox Hill, and they hit the epidural space when they gave her the epidural,  and she went into cardiac arrest. 
[02:40:30]  She went at pulmonary edema and eredemia.  I don't know shit, but code blue, 30 plainclothes doctors ran by, intensive care, it winds up.  She's in, they think, a coma, my ex-wife, and it was just traumatic, and she came out  of it.  I gave her the terms of endearment speech, and she was crying, and she woke up, and it  was like, I couldn't believe it.  Wow.  And then four days, she's in intensive care.  After about 48 hours, I go home to sleep.  She was pissed, too.  Didn't want me to go home to sleep.  Stay in that chair next to me.  But it was fucking horrible. 
[02:41:00]  We give birth.  The baby was, you know, they wear your baby by you, but the baby's blue because traumatic  birth.  They put her in intensive care.  Finally, I get the baby, my daughter.  Take her home, and I'm holding her, and my ex-wife's still in intensive care, and they,  my friends, the only friends that came over at that time, it was these four people.  It was Paul Provenza, Jackie Green, Carrie Snow, and I'm holding my baby, and I haven't  slept, and I've been through a lot of stress, and supposedly, supposedly, this is so wrong, 
[02:41:30]  everybody.  Please, if you're a parent, please, just realize that this is like the aristocrats kind  of comedy.  It's opposite of anything that I would even fathom or think.  It's not an instruction manual for you people.  It's nothing to practice or do.  Here we go.  Supposedly, I was holding my baby, and Paul said, your baby's beautiful, and I supposedly  said, you can finger her for a dollar.  Now, I don't think I did, because that's, I said, would have been five bucks, because  that's much too cheap. 
[02:42:00]  Now, you've got to understand, I'm a comedian.  I always say the worst thing, and it was the farthest thing.  I had to tell this to the person that I said it about.  Yeah.  Last, six months ago, because they did an article on it, and she went, thanks, Dad.  How'd she take it?  Well.  She knows me.  I mean, she's seen my stand-up.  Yeah.  As long as the story had a happy ending.  Well, it did.  The mom lived, and she's now very wealthy.  And I was able to tell it on here, so obviously, you know, it served a really great purpose. 
[02:42:30]  I feel bad that I did that.  Well.  But it's like, people come up to me and go, is it true?  I go, is what true?  Well, at least you only said it.  Yeah, that's true.  There you go.  Yeah, nothing, never.  People always, they talk about the line, and, you know, where do you draw it, and why do  you say such awful things, and it's, there's just something funny about the most inappropriate,  horrid thing you can say.  It's not so much clinically what you're saying, it's that you're actually saying it that makes 
[02:43:00]  it funny.  Right.  It's absolutely impossible.  Impossible.  And it's never, you know, in the aristocrats, for example, Gilbert Gottfried made a 9-11  joke.  Didn't do well.  And I have trouble with them, the 9-11 joke.  Yeah.  But I understand where they come from.  I don't laugh, but I'll stare and go, all right.  You know, I mean, I'm not going to kill somebody for it.  I know what he did it for.  And then he did the aristocrats joke at that Comedy Central special.  You saw the aristocrats.  Oh, so.  I did.  It's bizarre.  It's wild.  I loved it.  I didn't think you guys could pull it off, to be honest with you. 
[02:43:30]  Well, it was Penn and Paul.  They really, they fell on it.  Well, I mean, yeah, all you guys, and you guys pulled it off, big time.  I thought you, Gilbert Gottfried, and George Carlin were the best.  And I said that before you.  Thanks.  Thank you.  George is like the Yoda on, he explains.  George Carlin was amazing.  Well, he explained what we're all doing.  He explained what you do.  It's stuff that would normally be behind the trash bin in the schoolyard when you're 14  talking about it.  I want to see my, yeah.  Right.  I said, this guy's fucking this hooker.  You know, and the other guy's funny.  Yeah, and girls never like it. 
[02:44:00]  You know, why are you talking like that?  Then I'm looking for the woman that finds that shit funny.  Right.  Then I'm going to beat the fuck out of her.  Then I'm going to marry her.  That's what I meant.  The aristocrats.  Then I'm going to beat the fuck out of her.  The aristocrats is getting great reviews.  You want to explain the movie for the people out there that still don't know about it?  Yeah.  It's a family movie.  Because it's not released all over the country yet, right?  I love the song in that.  We are Siamese if you please.  You know somebody's showing up thinking, oh, I saw this one as a kid.  I've got to take my kids.  I love this one.  They eat spaghetti together. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, that's Lady and the Tramp.  They're sitting there going, this isn't the fun penguin movie.  You fuck a penguin.  This is a hundred comedians telling this joke, which is like 75 years old, and it's not  a good joke.  It's a bad joke.  It's an awful joke.  It's supposed to be a fondle joke.  Gary Owens at the premiere in L.A. said that he was told the joke by Jack Benny.  Wow.  I mean, this is like real shit.  I mean, and it's shit.  It's a shit joke.  So the point is, people want to get in showbiz so bad that they'll do this. 
[02:45:00]  So it's a family.  Don't tell the aristocrat joke.  Eric Cartman tells it on the web.  You can hear the streamlined version.  We're going to play that, but I mean, just set up what the movie's about, basically.  You don't have to do your version.  Okay, good.  It's a bunch of guys telling a joke about a family that goes into an agent's office to  get signed by him, and they have sex with each other, and they shit and piss on each  other, and then they go, ta-da, and the agent goes, what do you call yourself?  And they go, the aristocrats.  And the point of the thing is, how dirty and wrong can you make it until you get to this 
[02:45:30]  horrible punchline, which I never get to in the movie, actually.  No.  I just get to the acts that the family does with each other.  But what's funny is that it became anything at all.  What do you think, because not the whole thing, but what do you think, out of your interpretation  of it, is the harshest part of your...  Well, I actually had an interview with a lady who was crying and said that I offended her  so deeply because she was abused as a child, and I went, this is not my intention at all. 
[02:46:00]  You shouldn't have seen it.  That's not what this movie is.  I'm the opposite of that.  I swear to God.  I would do...  I'm the first guy that will run to the front of the plane or, you know, I don't give a shit.  If a kid, no matter what denomination, is hit by a car, I will help him.  That's nice.  Even black kids.  No, no.  I was thinking more Taliban.  You know, do you take the bomb pack off the kid before he detonates if he's been hit by a car?  Do you help the suicide bomber?  I say no.  No, maybe. 
[02:46:30]  Maybe.  You shouldn't have apologized, by the way.  It was her fault for dressing like that when she was young.  Nothing on that one.  I thought that was a really nice chuckle from everybody.  I laughed at the fact that it died.  If that helps you, no.  Oh, boy, you're going to go down hard.  We can do you.  That's okay.  You followed me with a horrible premise of saving a kid with a bomb pack.  We all have them on this show.  Well, we've got Cartman and the gang from South Park doing the aristocrats joke.  It's quick.  Let's play this here, and then we'll continue with Bob Saget.  You guys want to hear a funny joke my grandpa told me?  No.  Okay, so this family walks into a talent agency. 
[02:47:00]  It's a mother, father, their son and daughter, and a little baby.  The father says to the talent agent,  Sir, our family has an amazing act.  We know if you would let us perform it for you, you would want to sign us.  And the talent agent says,  Sorry, we don't sign family acts.  They're too cutesy.  But then the mother goes,  Please, sir, if you just give us two minutes, we know you'll like our act.  So the talent agent says,  All right, you've got two minutes.  The family jumps right into it.  The mother smiles and points to the son who hits play on a boombox.  Thrilling circus music starts to play as the father spins his daughter around,  bends her over, lifts up her skirt, and starts licking her asshole.  What?  Then the son lays down on the floor and opens his mouth, 
[02:47:30]  and the mother tears off tearaway pants,  squats down over his face, and starts shitting all over him.  Dude!  Hold on, hold on.  The father grabs the baby, takes off his diaper, and starts sucking his cock, right?  While the son, still with his mother's shit in his mouth,  goes over and licks the baby's tiny little balls.  Dude!  Hold on, cop.  Now the mother lays down on her back on the floor,  while the daughter gets up high on a chair and starts pissing all over.  Then the father and son take the baby and start stuffing it headfirst back into the mother's vagina,  while the daughter's piss rains down on all of them.  Dude, just stop.  They get the...  Hold on, cop.  They get the baby halfway in,  so that just his legs are sticking out all kicking and flailing around. 
[02:48:00]  The son takes the mother's shit out of his mouth,  and starts rubbing it all over everyone,  while the father sticks his cock in the baby's asshole,  and fucks it while it's still inside the mother,  until he comes all over the baby, the wife, and the son, and the daughter.  C-C-Cartman, I don't want to...  Cop!  Will you hold on, please?  Then the father gets up and says,  and now for our impersonation of the victims of 9-11.  And the whole family starts running around the room,  screaming and laughing with their dicks and titties all flapping around,  covered with shit and pissy cum,  going,  Ah!  Ah!  The baby's coming down!  Help!  And finally, the family runs back to the seat of the room and goes,  Ta-da! 
[02:48:30]  And the talent agent, he just sits there for the longest time.  And finally, he says,  Jesus, that's a hell of an act.  What do you call it?  And the father says,  The aristocrats.  I don't get it.  Neither do I.  And there is no punchline.  And the joke is,  aren't we classy?  That's the punchline.  And that's what's interesting, too.  The movie really is a documentary, as you know.  It's set up kind of like artistically.  They talk about there's no punchline. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  And some people talk about the punchline with relish,  like it's good.  You know, Billy Connolly says he likes it.  It was, it just.  I love the movie.  To see some of these guys get dirty,  like the, that you don't expect.  Jason Haller.  Paul Reiser.  Paul Reiser.  Drew Carey.  Was there anybody that wouldn't curse?  That said, no, I'm not going to do it?  A bunch of people didn't curse.  Rita Rudner didn't curse.  Of course.  And yet, but she was still cool.  I mean, she was still.  Larry Miller didn't curse.  Really?  I would have liked to have seen Bill Cosby and Seinfeld in it  just because they wouldn't have cursed.  Chris Rock didn't curse.  You know, he just kind of talked about comedy a little bit. 
[02:49:30]  You know, but they agreed to be part of it  because of the people involved in it.  Right.  And the guys, they had an amazing editor.  And it's doing really well.  It opens August 12th all over the country.  And then if it does well and gets legs,  they will spread and pollinate themselves  and get more, more theaters.  And the movie's not rated.  No, but it should be NC-17.  The language is as bad as it gets.  Howie Mandel, he says cunt about 30 times.  Howie Mandel.  That's not a good word. 
[02:50:00]  You rarely see it in movies these days.  No, not enough.  Not a good one.  It's a good word as a noun.  It's great as an adjective.  I was on her show yesterday.  She's kind of attractive.  She told me she has four kids.  I went, whoa, cock blockers.  Don't let that out of here.  Really?  Yeah, she's very pretty.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  This is proof, this story, that there is no God.  Yeah, we hit on this one already.  Dana Reeve, Christopher Reeve's wife,  that sat there with him all those years,  just found out she has lung cancer.  No. 
[02:50:30]  Where is a God that would do such a thing?  Oh, boy.  The woman's wiping his ass for years and gets done.  Maybe that's how she caught it.  Oh, my God.  I hope not.  Yes, you do catch lung cancer from wiping asses.  Well, we don't know.  We don't know.  We don't, do we?  Well, Peter Jennings was fucking great.  Yeah.  He was great.  I hate when great people die.  Why can't the fucking shitheads die?  He's like Geraldo, you meant to say.  No, I don't want to name him by name. 
[02:51:00]  Of course you do.  Bill O'Reilly.  Journalist indeed.  Bill O'Reilly.  Stop it.  Indeed.  Peter Jennings was one of the last of the old school real journalists.  And Manson is as healthy as can be, and he smokes every day, and he's enjoying  whatever the hell goes on in prison.  I think he had LASIK eye surgery.  He's doing great.  Peter Jennings, I was watching, and he couldn't help but watch like an hour, because you watched  him for so many years.  This guy's a fucking genius.  He was just a renaissance guy. 
[02:51:30]  He really loved his audience.  He was a full broadcaster.  Loved the people he was broadcasting to.  It doesn't get any better than that.  Yeah.  He's just, he's the best.  He had dignity and respect as a journalist.  And a big cock, I hear.  Huge.  Huge.  He had to change his name to Peter.  Originally.  And Keith, was it you that IM'd me?  The other night, I got IM'd from some dummy who goes, Tom Brokaw died.  Oh, no, it wasn't you?  I hate the web.  It's another guy I love.  New York's fucking finest. 
[02:52:00]  People get all the names wrong.  Yeah, but he's a cop.  Of all the people that should know the detail.  It'll be like, Charo died.  No!  Say no.  Let's go to Pennsylvania.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Bob, I went to your old high school.  There's not a day that goes by that we don't bring up your name.  You're the worst thing that came from our high school.  Jesus, dude.  You mean Hamilton?  We have football stars coming out.  We have actresses.  We have people that are in college right now making big bucks. 
[02:52:30]  In college?  Who came out of your college?  Who?  What high school are you talking about, man?  Abington, man.  Yeah, I was there one year.  I was just there my senior year.  We actually have your face behind a shard of glass that's just like Bob Saget from Abington.  That's fucked up.  I had nothing to do with that, dude.  But, I mean...  So you hate that I can't...  I love you.  You're a funny guy.  Oh, you like me?  Yes.  After all that.  I got confused.  I mean, I like you.  The majority doesn't. 
[02:53:00]  Well, they can go fuck myself.  No, they'll be fine.  I don't really care anymore.  I just want to make people laugh.  If they're smart enough to laugh, then fine.  If not, I hope they get, you know, diarrhea.  Stay in Abington.  Real stinky diarrhea.  It's the kind of diarrhea that once they stink up their toilet, it doesn't go away.  And all their friends know that it smells like barf coming out of their ass.  That's what I hope those people, the galloping ghosts that don't know that I'm a good guy.  Nice watery cancer shit.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking the shit that Chris Reeves' wife is doing. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, how's she doing anyway?  Did they say?  How is she?  Well, undergoing treatment.  That's like the worst.  She got too close.  Why couldn't that happen to people that don't like me at Abington?  Right.  I can't wait until Keith the Cop eyes me later.  Boy, Bob Vila was dirty today.  Bob Vila.  Let me help you with your door frame.  Everybody in Abington, someday they hope to move to Conja Hocken.  Well, the thing is, they don't know me.  They just sell the full house.  They figure, oh, this guy's fruity and making a lot of money. 
[02:54:00]  That sucks.  I hate him.  And people in Philly a lot of times are really nice or they're real resentful.  They'll say things like, oh, we don't need to live in New York.  We're better than New York because we're from Philly.  And I love Philly.  I love Philly, but not when people are arrogant like their town's better than anywhere else.  Jimmy doesn't like the girls from Philly.  They're all cocky.  I've never fucked a chick from Philly.  Hottest girls.  They give you great vibes and then they back out.  They're all cock teasers.  Every one of them.  Is it just Philly? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Is there anything you want to tell me?  No, no.  In Cleveland, they'll fucking let you eat their ass in the airport.  They're phenomenal in Cleveland.  Philadelphia stinks.  The chicks stink in Philly.  Well, I married a girl from there.  She was great for a long time.  She loved me a long time.  Did she grow up in Philly?  Yeah, Abington.  Or Elkins Park or somewhere.  But there are great people in Philly.  It's just, you know, we've got to convince that school.  We've got to change my shrine.  My shrine's what fucks it up.  I probably got a bouffant hairdo in the picture.  Philly has that blue collar thing where they hate anyone doing well. 
[02:55:00]  Like they show up at the sporting events just to yell out racial slurs.  It's just really the last union town.  And everybody should be carrying a lunch bucket.  It's also a really smart town, though.  There's also all these, so it's a, you know, duality.  Yeah.  They're total, Philly's our best market.  I mean, it's the best O.P. Anthony market.  They're fucking savages in Philly.  Just the chicks alone.  It really is the greatest.  Let's go to Friday in New York.  Friday, what's up?  Good morning.  Morning, Friday.  Bob, I just want to say I'm so proud of you for being human, baby. 
[02:55:30]  I am so proud of you.  Thank you, Holden.  For letting the niceness go.  And I just want to know, I have been here all week.  I want to know how dirty you are.  Do you want to eat some leftovers?  Are you the porn chick that spit in my mouth?  Yeah, she spit in my mouth.  She's sexy.  Oh, we know Friday.  I don't do leftovers, but it's nice to meet you.  He's into some sick shit, yeah.  Oh, he is?  Yeah.  Yeah, a little spit.  You let a woman spit in your mouth.  Absolutely.  Like she was standing outside that window there.  She spit all over the window and started tonguing it.  And all of us are kind of like, ugh. 
[02:56:00]  And he's the only one that went, mm.  He's like, nice.  Like that's something hot.  I'm thinking glass plus.  Yeah, I know.  I'm like, who cleaned that up?  Nobody.  We came back three days later.  It was still there.  It was crystallized all over the window.  Friday, you're close to the studio?  Yeah, I'm pretty close.  I got to go.  I think you do have to leave soon, huh?  Yeah, I don't need to meet you.  I would like to meet you.  I am nice, though.  I just say bad.  I just want to call in and say I'm really proud of him for being human, for letting the niceness  go, and just letting people have it.  I'm really proud of him.  Well, thank you very much. 
[02:56:30]  All right, Friday.  Let's go to John in Virginia.  John.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  I was going to say, I went to the show you did at Virginia Tech.  Oh, that was fun as shit.  That was awesome.  Do you remember the guy that came out at your show?  Yes, actually.  What happened?  He realized he was gay, and he came out.  Because people tell me shit, like it's Jerry Springer or something.  It was a couple thousand people, and this guy stood up, and he ended up announcing that 
[02:57:00]  he was gay, kind of.  Am I right?  Kind of.  Yeah.  Yeah, you guys sucked one cock.  Hey, Fez, you got anything to say to him?  Danny Tanner was always so easy to talk to.  It started out, you were asking who all shaved their balls in the crowd.  You start off with Dave Coulier, and then these two dudes jumped up, and they were like, yeah,  we fucked last week or something.  Wow.  And other people there didn't know it. 
[02:57:30]  So it was a big thing for these guys.  A little shocker.  Yeah, maybe I'm not helping America.  That's not.  And actually, I talked with you at the bar after a show, and we talked about Dennis Haskins.  He doesn't remember you, sir.  He's a celebrity.  It's going to be shocking.  He's polite.  He does the show every day.  No, no, but what did we say?  What did we talk about?  You were talking about Dennis Haskins, and you're like, yeah, Belding loves the cock. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, I don't know if I said, I don't know if I would say, oh, you mean Mr. Balvadier?  No, Mr. Balvadier, off the Saved by Bell.  Oh, the principal from Saved by the Bell.  Oh, that was a joke.  I don't even know him.  That was just a joke.  I say that on a map.  I probably should watch what I say as a joke.  Yeah.  No, I don't know the sexual behavior of most people, or care, really.  I've got my own issues.  Remember me, Bob?  I signed a napkin.  I had a club soda.  Oh, yeah.  You were the guy.  He doesn't remember you, stupid.  But I vaguely remember that, kind of, sort of, but thank you for your compliment on the 
[02:58:30]  show.  It was really fun.  They were a great audience, Virginia Tech.  There's a couple more, and then you have to be out of here by 10, they're saying?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  What time does it go till?  11.  11.  Oh, I've got time.  I've got time.  Let me just look at my thing.  We're having too much fun.  Jamie, what's up?  Hello.  Go ahead, Jamie.  Yeah.  There is no way this is Bob Saget.  I cannot believe you guys are trying to pull this force off.  I have watched Bob Saget through America's Funniest Home Videos. 
[02:59:00]  I have watched him.  They're unbelievable.  This is unbelievable.  Welcome to the real world, sir.  Even when I did the...  He's got a potty mouth.  Yeah.  It doesn't even sound like him.  It's not his cute, smiley self.  Sir, your sinuses are really irritating me.  You sound like Clifford Peaches from my bodyguard.  Sir, even when I did the two shows, I was on HBO, and I, like, I did a...  Sure.  I talked dirty and shit.  I did do that, but you were young then, so you didn't see it. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  Let's say hi to Kenny.  Kenny, what's up?  Hey, Kenny with Clear Signs is here.  All right, Kenny.  Wow.  Hey, Bob.  Three people got that, and we're in this room.  Hating you all this time.  Hold on, Kenny.  Start over.  We're all over the place.  Oh, he's saying he hated me all this time.  You see?  My favorite opening backhand and non-compliment.  Well, it gets good, though, Bob.  Okay, I'm here.  Kenny with Clear Signs is here again.  Hey, Bob, I sincerely want to apologize.  I've always said I hated you on that Funniest Home Video show.  He may be sick, but I guess that was the writers. 
[03:00:00]  But I really feel guilty now hearing that you're a normal guy.  Well, thanks, man.  Isn't that awful that Christopher Reeve turned into Lex Luthor?  He really did look awful.  He was Superman, and it just...  They're showing him up on CNN.  Oh.  Impressive posture.  All right, Clear Signs is checking out.  All right, thank you.  One more.  Thanks, man.  You know, you got to give it to him, huh?  Sitting in that chair.  Unbelievable.  He was starting to get some movement back, though.  He got, like, a little bit of feeling in, like, fingertips and stuff like that.  If I had to move my finger, that would end it.  You'd just hear a bang. 
[03:00:30]  Just get the trigger finger working out.  That's my all-time nightmare, is being paralyzed.  Mine is a guy calling up saying he always hated you.  Remember when I met you?  You turned a lot of people around on you.  Bob, I had actually been plotting to kill you.  I want to turn him around so I can go in the rear entry.  Now you want to turn you around.  Mike the Trucker, what's up?  I heard a rumor a few years ago that Bob is a obsessive-compulsive cleaner. 
[03:01:00]  No, that was on the TV show.  Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins, eats people.  Yeah.  No, I'm not a self.  No, that was a TV show character.  I wanted to make it like Felix Unger.  That was what?  Yeah, that was it.  I did that on the Full House show that's on every day for four hours.  All right.  That's why the rumor existed.  They are handing me notes.  Bob's people are saying wrap it up.  No, no, no.  My next interview, let's see.  I got a taped radio interview at 11.  So I could really go, unless they say otherwise. 
[03:01:30]  It's in Philly, but.  No, no.  I can go until, this wall's distracting.  Yeah.  I can go until, I thought I could go until 10.30.  Yeah.  I can go until 10.30.  It's 11.  Come on.  No, I'm good.  I'm good.  Thank you.  I don't want to leave.  I mean, he's having a great time.  I like it here.  Yeah.  I belong to a place like this.  Your people must be thinking it's going well.  Get him out of there before you mix with too many things.  Don't you have that thing about that thing?  Yeah, right.  Here's the post that you told me to give you. 
[03:02:00]  Colonel Tom's out there.  Get my boy out of there.  We're ruining everything we planned.  I'm getting 50% of this.  20 years.  20 years I built this character with this.  I've got to be an ABC radio.  It's not far.  No.  It's a half hour from now.  All right.  I don't know.  How many times a day is that show on?  Every time you turn on the channel now.  It's on four times a day.  It's on two networks.  It's on ABC Family and it's on Nick and Nick.  And now the video show is on PAX and ABC Family. 
[03:02:30]  You've got a piece of the syndication, right?  No.  Wait, no.  Stop it.  Nobody owns any of it.  Why?  No cast member owns any of it.  It's called getting a job.  The people that own it are the producers.  How do you go so long, though?  We're on the show eight years?  Eight years.  And not like renegotiating.  You do renegotiate.  You get a huge amount of money up front.  And that's your money.  And you shut up and you take it because you're lucky as ass to get on it.  You have to be like a producer.  You have to own the show.  Own the show.  Or you have to say, you know.  Like Ray Romano.  Or Jerry.  You have to have that deal.  You know, I was a cast member. 
[03:03:00]  Wow.  Right.  All those times.  You watch it four times a day and just nothing coming in from it.  It's the new Brady Bunch.  No, you get paid.  You get paid some crappy little scale crap.  Not like you would for a decent occasion.  Oh, no.  Not if you owned it.  You'd buy it.  Jason Alexander is always furious about the Seinfeld deal.  You can tell from the DVD things that he's just a bitter motherfucker.  He's not.  Really?  Maybe it was just the other people he was hanging with that day.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Because they're all nice.  Michael's great.  Yeah.  And she's great.  Wasn't he about to pull a million an episode? 
[03:03:30]  I think that Seinfeld, they offered five million an episode, and they offered a million an episode  to the rest of the cast, and that's when Jerry turned it down.  And maybe that's what he's annoyed about.  Like, jeez, I could have made a million a week.  Well, sure, there was ego stuff.  There always is.  But, you know, that's one of the greatest shows ever on TV.  Absolutely.  And the, you know, if you're making a million episodes up front, that's, you know, don't complain.  I got the DVDs, though.  Who are you?  By the way, how can you publicly complain when people are working hard to make $22,000 a year?  No, no.  But I don't think you got it.  I'm just going to say, I think, like, the season that they would have done that was  when Jerry turned it down.  Like, I don't know.  Still, if you're up to $750,000 a show, you know, you can't ever complain to any. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Who are you going to complain to?  Right.  It's just, it's just, it's ludicrous.  Donald Trump, I guess, or Paris Hilton.  Somebody making more money.  Yeah.  There's a rumor about you and Paris Hilton.  Someone's saying on the line.  Nope.  Nope.  I've talked to her before.  Is that just a dumb phone call?  Maybe I wrote it.  It's the only guy that didn't fuck her.  Mike in Atlanta.  What's up, Mike?  Mike?  Good morning, sweet.  I wanted to find out.  I heard that Bob Saget might have been romantically linked to Paris Hilton.  Any truth to that, Bob? 
[03:04:30]  No, absolutely not.  It's funny.  It is your turn.  I've talked to her before, and she looked kind of attractive.  If that was the case, it wouldn't be a rumor anymore.  He'd get a billboard made or something.  I would get that good infrared footage that they had, and I'd brighten it up.  The technology's really improved.  Also, I will give you a buck fifty now to let me see your daughter now.  Jesus.  Now, that is where I tell you to go fuck yourself.  There you go.  Now, you go fuck yourself, Bob.  Oh, you too, buddy.  You can't talk about my daughter like that, dude.  All right, Greg and Marilyn, what's up?  Wait a minute, I did.  That's what he's drawing. 
[03:05:00]  So I take that back, sir.  Now, I take back telling you to fuck yourself, because I realized I opened the forum.  But it was years ago, and I was under a dress.  I was under duress.  Attractive girl?  Who?  What?  Attractive girl?  Subject change.  Yeah, that means yes.  All right, let's go to Greg.  Greg?  No, she's horrific.  What's her father going to say?  Horrid.  She has no vagina.  That's why I can make that joke.  It's opposite day.  Help me! 
[03:05:30]  That's her first words.  Help me!  Yeah, that's right.  I am not an animal.  All right, let's go to Greg.  Greg in Maryland.  We're hanging out with Bob Saget.  Yeah, absolutely.  And Ron and Fez.  And Ron and Fez.  I have to tell you guys, Bob is funny as shit.  He was funny before he started doing the TV shows.  He did what he had to do and made a shitload of money.  Fuck everyone who might give him shit for it.  And he's funny as hell later, too.  I mean, I've seen you doing your guest spots on these HBO bits.  And Bob, you're funny as hell. 
[03:06:00]  I just wanted to tell you congratulations.  Thank you.  You make me laugh my ass off.  You're really nice.  Thank you, man.  It's just nice to hear something like, where do I sign the prenups?  Are you going to be playing New York soon?  You know, I'm doing a benefit here November 1st at Caroline's.  I did it last year for the Scleroderma Research Foundation because my sister died of Scleroderma 10 years ago.  And so I do tons of benefits last year.  That's that Lucian had, right?  Scleroderma.  That Lucian had it.  In fact, Ray Romano is going to do our benefit April 6th in Los Angeles at the Beverly Wilshire.  And we raised $700,000 last year when we did it here at Caroline's. 
[03:06:30]  And we had Conan O'Brien help me and did the auction with Tina Fey.  And we had Louis Black and Robert Klein.  So I don't know who we're getting for November 1st, but we're doing it at Caroline's.  And it's a high-end event, but my sister died of it.  And if anybody has Scleroderma, like Lucian, I'm on the board.  Can I give the website?  Yeah, go.  It's sclerodermaresearch.org.  Yeah, and our listeners are going to be able to spell that.  Well, if they've got Scleroderma, it's even harder because sometimes it affects your fingers.  Is that it?  How do you type it?  Believe me, it's not their fingers that are the problem with Scleroderma.  Lucian had two fingers cut off. 
[03:07:00]  It was awful, man.  It's 1-800-441-CURE is the number.  It was that my sister had that and died within three years.  And a dear friend of mine had it, too.  And you lose your life to it.  It's fucking horrible.  Jeez.  Yeah, so trying to help.  It's like, don't you stiffen up like from the outsiders?  It's just brutal.  I just want to get it in my dick.  I just want it in my dick.  Because your dick gets all hard.  And then they cut it off, so it just solves all my problems.  The worst, though, is if you get it in the base and the head is still soft and dangling.  Right.  The base is firm and turgid. 
[03:07:30]  It's like a toggle bolt with a mushroom at the end of it.  Wow.  Well, it's like a shiitake at the end of a pencil.  Let's go to Mark in Philly.  Mark, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  You know, when Jimmy goes to become a cable TV star, keep on sitting and fuck Ross.  Yeah, we're going to lose Jimmy for a few months.  Why?  It's a real bummer.  He's doing an HBO show.  It's fantastic.  What show are you doing?  Louis C.K.'s show.  Yeah, I talked to Louis.  That should be great.  Yeah, it sounds great. 
[03:08:00]  I'm hoping it sticks, you know.  I hope it does, too.  It sounds like they're trying to change the envelope a little bit.  So, Jimmy's going to fly out to L.A. and do the show.  Good.  Three weeks there, one week back for radio, three weeks there.  So, we've got to, like, get people to sit in this seat.  Well, if I'm around, I'll come by and visit.  But I'm working, too.  I'm working on a new show.  Yeah.  And I'm working on, I think I'm directing something.  You can just tell us no, Bob.  She's adorable.  No, but I would.  Okay.  What are you doing?  It's our listeners giving me links to pictures of you and your daughter.  Where?  I don't know.  So, like, wire image? 
[03:08:30]  It's on dailyceleb.com.  Right.  Probably at the Willy Wonka premiere or something.  Congratulations.  You're the Daily Celeb.  Oh, great.  Great.  This is just what I'm looking for.  Brett Memphis, go.  What's happening, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning.  I'm going to tell you right now, there's no way in hell I would have ever listened to  anything or heard anything with Bob Saget's name.  I would have turned the channel until about 15 minutes ago when I got on my car.  What?  This guy is fucking hilarious.  Oh, thank you, man.  If you ever get in the South, man, I'd love to know where you're at. 
[03:09:00]  I'd love to come see you.  Yeah, it'll be in the paper or something.  Are you on the shuttle, sir?  Are you on the space shuttle?  Come on.  It sounds loud.  Punch it out.  I got to tell you, Brett, Bob's our new favorite.  Brett, you're one of our new faves.  I got to tell you, you got to keep in touch.  We'd love to do a little something-something with you.  Thank you.  I knew he had something going when he was talking about the MiFi on the plane and how Leslie  Ann Warren had the ice on her head, and I think I had asked how she did it, if he knew.  And he said something, how he attached the antenna for the MiFi to Leslie Ann Warren's 
[03:09:30]  head, and it somehow injured her.  And then you said, did you screw it in?  You hammered it in with a nail or something?  Swing line stapler and smashed it.  That's right.  Stapled it to her head.  What has she been in?  I know that's an ignorant question.  She was in Clue, the movie Clue.  Remember that?  Cinderella.  Cinderella.  When I was growing up, I was in love and love.  She was in like Columbo episodes.  Victor Victoria, she was in.  Yeah.  Highway to a lot of murder.  She's very pretty.  The one with Chris Knight as the dancer, and she's the older woman down in Florida. 
[03:10:00]  Some kind of 80s film.  Got some, she, back in, you know, I guess 70s and stuff, she was really very hot.  I think she used to bang on a lot of famous guys, too.  Really?  She was married.  I think she was married to somebody.  Type deal or something.  Right, right.  Oh, now I know who she is.  Yeah, look at the picture.  Right on there.  She's very pretty.  She had the big tits, too.  Yeah, she got a hell of a set, as they say.  She had an extra set in her luggage.  She packed them away.  Just in case somebody knew them bigger. 
[03:10:30]  Who's that woman on the Surreal Life now that says she was the first?  Oh, Janice Dickinson.  I used to sleep with Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson, and I'm going, yeah, not lately.  I was the first supermodel.  Now you look like them.  Oh, God.  She's a funny lady, though.  You ought to have her on here.  She'll talk about everybody she's ever fucked.  Yeah?  She would mean it, too.  Will the name Bob Saget come up?  No, no.  I've never fucked her, but she introduced me to some girl she thought I should fuck. 
[03:11:00]  And then I called the girl, but she's, you know, she was asleep at USC.  I couldn't get a hold of her.  How many chicks want to bang you, though?  Just, like, strippers and stuff?  Wow.  One of them's a guy.  From Alabama.  Exactly.  God, the phones just...  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, one after another.  Hated Bob now loves Bob.  Hey, what's this Rolling with Bob Saget thing about?  We want to promote this thing.  I don't know if you want to play it.  I mean, it's up to you guys.  It's Jamie Kennedy came up with this song, and it's the clean version. 
[03:11:30]  There's a dirty one where I...  This isn't the dirty version?  They bleat motherfucker or they scramble it.  I don't know if you want to do something that gets bleeped, but it's funny.  It did it with...  Jay-Z has listened to this stuff, because Jamie Kennedy's coming out with a rap album, like  a comedy Eminem.  Jamie's funny.  Yeah.  I don't know how you feel about him, but he's funny.  Don't know enough about Jamie.  Well, this is a song.  I don't know.  It's funny.  It's going to be on a CD eventually?  It's going to be on a CD.  It's on the web right now.  Rolling with Saget.  It's about...  If you're cool, you hang with me. 
[03:12:00]  Very cool.  But I don't know if I...  You know, you can play it or not.  I don't know.  We'll play...  There's not a lot of time, maybe...  Quite a pitch you're giving us.  Panicking.  I think it's very funny.  No, I like it.  I think it's very funny, and everybody likes it, but it's...  You've got to sit and listen to it, so people would have to hear it.  Bob, this is...  And this is radio.  Bob, this is...  Well, play it.  Play it.  This is satellite radio.  It's either this or 15 minutes of commercials.  I think we can handle the song.  Well, play it.  I'm all good.  I think it's funny.  But then again, people hated me.  Right.  This might switch him back now. 
[03:12:30]  Bob, I hated you when you first came on, and then I really love you.  Now I hate you again.  15 minutes.  What happened?  That's the funny song.  Jamie Kennedy's.  That's on his website, whatever the hell that is.  What we can do is we can wrap up here so you can go to ABC.  Yeah, you can play it then.  And we can play this in the break.  That is actually a great idea.  Look at you with your whole structuring of the program.  This is why you guys get the big bucks.  This is why he sits behind the levers and knobs.  It's all changing, you know.  It's all getting weird.  It is.  Will you keep in touch with us or what?  I'm going to drunk-jile you every day.  Really?  No, I would love to come and visit you when I come here. 
[03:13:00]  You have what is called the open invitation.  How about you give him the hotline?  That's what my ex-girlfriend said about her ass.  And if you ever want an open invitation to something, that is...  I actually put a sanitized strip over it.  There's yellow crime scene tape on my ex-girlfriend's ass.  No, that's not.  Which one is the question?  Which ass?  She had two.  She was a hydra.  I want to own with two assholes, no vagina.  Then there's no danger of pregnancy.  Two assholes, hers and me.  Let's just see when he stops.  Let's just let him roll for a while. 
[03:13:30]  I'm sorry.  I just realized.  There's no speed bump.  No, this is how...  What is that?  That is a fake vagina, dude?  Yes.  Just sitting there like the fucking shank bone at Passover?  I mean, I can't...  I'm not even thinking about it, man.  You're talking about girls spitting in your mouth and your hand in me.  That's Mary Carey's fake vag there, yeah.  Oh, looks like a pig foot.  That's not good.  What's her name?  That is the original.  Mary Carey.  From the Chicago Cubs, the old announcer?  You know what?  You're real fucked up if you use the other end. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, that's Harry Carey's asshole.  The other end is the fucked up dude.  Holy cow!  The cleaning hole?  The cleaning hole.  The hole you use to clean it out.  Yeah, you cut it out and do the other side.  Yeah, you're right.  It looks more like Harry Carey's asshole.  Years ago, our forefathers went to the desert.  This represents the pussy they didn't get.  Forty years we were in the desert and we didn't get pussy.  Hold up the monster and I'll hold up the pussy.  Your mother never shaved it up like this.  Now eat your hobo leg, it's Passover. 
[03:14:30]  Hey, let's go to Brendan.  Brendan, Atlantic City, I guess.  Yeah, Brendan, go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Bob, how can I ever watch that wholesome bullshit you used to do now that I know you're such a deviant?  Well, try not to watch me pick up the kids.  All right, guys, I got one black dead guy left on my phone.  Oh, you fucked it up.  You stink, you nervous Nelly.  Look at him, trying to get his line out.  Oh, my God.  He was angry at himself is what he was angry at. 
[03:15:00]  A lot of special people calls you get.  Oh, always.  I'm parked outside my school.  I got to go.  They call him and try to get a line out.  Right.  And it just falls apart because they're nervous.  Well, they get excited.  I know.  And they got the big jokes they've saved up that are either dirty or racial.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And the combo of.  Mm-hmm.  Usually.  I used to hate you.  I can't watch Full House again.  Bye.  I hated you.  Hated you.  Hated you.  Like you.  Bye.  Well, why don't we wrap this thing up? 
[03:15:30]  Right out.  Bob Saget is our new friend.  He's going to call from time to time, hopefully.  You guys are great, and I'm glad everything's good between us.  You weren't holding signs up that day.  You weren't holding signs up that day.  We playing the John Kennedy song?  No.  Jamie Kennedy.  No.  I even told him that at Caroline's.  I'm like, I was in studio, and it's like, I know when someone's getting shit on, because  there's definitely a look around the studio.  Oh, yeah.  And we had.  Watch me leave, and you guys will be like, we did it again.  Listen on your MyFi.  He believes we like him.  Listen to the replay on your MyFi.  Right.  Let's see how we really think.  Right.  That's the danger of the replays.  That's when we got to call up in a couple weeks. 
[03:16:00]  I want to come back and be a guest.  Yeah, right.  Here's what we call an open invitation.  Go fuck yourself.  Didn't you hear the replay?  That's when we get real brave, is after you guys leave.  But now with these replays, it sucks.  We used to be able to hide a little bit, but now the show's on all day.  You could smash somebody until they got to the car.  You had to give somebody four or five minutes to get to the car.  You could just smack them for four minutes.  That's right.  You need to hear about cut out the fake vaginas on the weekend.  Yeah.  All day.  Well, thank you for having me, and the Aristocrats is something for people to see. 
[03:16:30]  Especially your listeners.  I mean, it would be right in the...  I highly recommend it.  It's getting great reviews.  Like I said earlier, you, Gilbert Godfrey, and George Carlin were my faves in the whole movie.  Thank you.  That is the God's honest truth.  The Aristocrats.  And he used to hate you.  He used to hate you.  I used to hate myself.  And Jim, congratulations, and I'll see you in L.A. when you're doing that.  Full frontal nudity in the Louis C.K. show?  I would like to see that.  I mean, you.  No, no, no.  I mean, just in the back.  Hot.  I tuck it back, and I show him the helmet.  A little bit of concentration camp, Phil. 
[03:17:00]  Is this hot?  I don't know.  It's sad.  I only regret that I didn't live back then, because I would have nailed Anne Frank.  Sure.  Right in the attic.  Dear diary.  What's she going to do, yell out?  She will write about it the next day.  That's the problem.  Yeah, it is.  Thank God she wasn't around with the Internet.  She's just constantly posting.  Frank's blog.  The blog of Anne Frank.  But you guys are great.  I'm sorry if I offended any listeners by being a dirty fucker. 
[03:17:30]  No, I, you know, I've all, there's nothing wrong with doing this.  Those people went to the loft like a half hour ago.  Forty minutes ago.  The loft.  Tracy Chow.  Putting lipstick on her clitoris.  Fucking a fast car.  All right, we're going to play rolling with Bob Saget as we say thank you to Bob for stopping by.  Because I'm in the car, I'll hear.  12 seconds.  This sucks.  It's kind of funny near the end, kind of, sort of.  We're going to play the whole damn thing.  All right.  That's what we do.  Whatever you got to do, you do.  But I appreciate it, and I'll see you at the next one.  All right.  Thanks, Bob Saget, everyone. 
[03:18:00]  Thank you.  You are now about to witness the strength of Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  Bob Saget.  Have you ever had one of those nights that started off so damn good?  No fights, no fuss.  It's understood that when you go to the bar, man.  We ain't leaving until those girls in the car.  Well, this night started off just like that, except Jamie's in the driver's seat.  Bob Saget's in the back, we're rolling on 20s to the club, pull up front, Saget's in the 
[03:18:30]  backseat, rolling a blunt.  Valley opens up the door to park the car, the bouncer at the front, don't want to let  us in the bar.  Bob stays here, let me show him some affection.  Then he walks up, wound up in cold clock, dead dumb.  Started screaming for the dog to respect him, next thing you know, we're in the VIP section.  When crew runs deep like this, you want to brag, yeah.  You're rolling with, man.  I'm rolling with Saget.  You're rolling with Bob.  You're with Bob Saget.  You're with Alimento Uno.  Nobody does it better.  You're rolling with Bob.  You're with Bob Saget.  Feel this motherfucking in a cardigan sweater.  Now the nice thing, but everybody's getting tipsy. 
[03:19:00]  Bob's in the booth with a chick from Patepsy.  The daughter in the Dom Perry arm just drinking from the bottle.  Making plans to leave the club with three models.  That's when DMX and 56 walked in.  Bob stood up and said, who are you again?  At first all they did was stand around and stare.  The next push, Bob, and 50 hit him with a chair.  He's in the car, not getting tacky shoes and no socks.  You want a hard club, motherfuckers.  Pull out a Glock.  I got a Glock like a donkey, hard as a rock.  And a trigger finger itchier than chicken pox.  Now everybody threw their hands in the air.  Bob's drunk with a gun and he just don't care.  We on the floor, he's on the table now firing shots. 
[03:19:30]  There are symptoms on his cell phone calling the cops.  He blew the smoke off the tip of his gun.  Bob Saget, you better act someone.  You're rolling with Bob.  You're with Bob.  You're with Bob Saget.  You're with Bob Saget.  In a cardigan sweater.  Bob grabs us and the girls, he runs out the back door.  He's feeling froggy that he's still hungry for more.  He's in the backseat getting busy again.  Asking the girls if they're lesbians.  The girls start kissing, now my f***ing home.  I go to my place, the hot tub's in the backyard. 
[03:20:00]  I got beer heavy and out the couch.  Yo, Jay, pull over, I gotta pee in a bush.  When you're rolling with Saget, there's no time for rest.  This mother f***ing bottle caps off of the chest.  Yo, I'm Bob Saget.  This is what I do.  My house, my car, this is my crew.  I don't know what your day is, too.  But you don't mean street to Malibu.  Good night, boys.  Tomorrow, how are we gonna do it again?  Bob Saget, my best friend.  You're rolling with Bob.  You're with Bob Saget.  No matter uno, nobody does it better.  You're rolling with Bob.  You're with Bob Saget.  Illus mother f***ing in a cardigan sweater. 
[03:20:30]  You're rolling with Bob.  You're with Bob Saget.  No matter uno, nobody does it better.  You're rolling with Bob Saget.  Illus mother f***ing in a cardigan sweater.  I just love a drive in the country laughing with Opie and Anthony. 
[03:21:00]  That plane is flying awfully low.  Don't you think, Ramon?  Ramon, call 9-1-1.  Nice. 
[03:21:30]  That's the Danny Warhol.  Smoke it.  My favorite song that Ethel is spinning on XM Satellite Radio.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  In studio, Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  If you're just tuning in, Ron and Fez have joined 202. 
[03:22:00]  And we couldn't be happier.  We're giving out these golden tickets.  And of course the first one had to go to Ron and Fez.  Of course it had to.  Yes.  Our old pals from the WNEW day.  We found, by the way, the Daily News article we were talking about earlier after we got  fired and Ron and Fez were the only ones left at the station, WNEW, and they did a story  on them in the Daily News.  Well, the internet.  With the internet, nothing ever goes away.  That damn internet. 
[03:22:30]  That internet.  There's the pictures.  Oh, you know what?  This is the weird thing.  This is actually a different story.  But that picture started making the way around.  Like that was our 8x10 we were passing out.  And the headline manages to bash both shows in just a few words.  To quash static light duo in slot of schlock jocks.  So you're the light duo.  Right.  You're not that good.  You're alright. 
[03:23:00]  We're taking the schlock jocks.  Yeah.  And you're taking the slot of the schlock jocks.  But we're pussies.  You guys are the devil and we're pussies.  Right.  Right.  Not quite schlock.  Now I know what Bob Saget goes through.  It really hurts.  I would cry if I got as many compliments as him.  By the way, this XM pen fucking exploded in my pant leg.  And it fucking ruined my jeans.  Welcome.  Welcome, Ronnie.  This is the funny joke.  This is my golden ticket. 
[03:23:30]  By the way.  Did you get your XM dribble cup?  Didn't four out of the five people who got a golden ticket  get completely fucked over somehow?  They get sucked into a chocolate hole or something?  Yeah, that's hilarious.  Another one got shrunk.  Yeah, right.  Another one turned into a blueberry.  Only one got the prize, really.  I didn't see the Johnny Depp movie,  but I remember the kids' movie from years ago.  That's why this whole golden ticket thing makes sense,  because we will rebuild a team,  and we'll be the last one standing again. 
[03:24:00]  Completely.  We'll fuck everyone over again.  We're the Willy Wonka.  Someone's got to inherit it and be the light duo  from placing a schlock jock.  Oh, father, we're going now.  I can't believe it.  You know what?  We were talking about this,  of what it was like at NEW after you guys left.  I don't know whether you ever heard this song  that Brother Joe did about Black Girl.  Oh, it was a classic.  It was, we brought this in for you, Ope, 
[03:24:30]  to give it a listen, because...  We've never played this.  No.  It's one of my personal favorite songs  that my brother's ever done.  It sounds like the song.  Yeah.  The lyrics, very funny, very relevant.  It's done to catch us.  Yeah.  You've got to set this up for the entire country,  because there's a lot of people  that have no idea who Black Earl is,  who, by the way,  will be helping out the Ron and Fez show.  We're not allowed to say that,  because there's been a background check  being done on him right now.  Background.  What?  Background check.  That should take about five minutes. 
[03:25:00]  Really?  You were born.  You did nothing.  You did radio.  You were a dull man.  I asked him to come in today with us  and hang out,  but his dad had just opened up a hydrant  over in Queens,  and he's going to be running back and forth all day.  That's so hot out.  It's vacation time in Queens.  I can't believe you said something, though.  The water park comes to you.  You were supposed to keep it quiet,  but now the jig's up.  Oh!  Don't do that.  He's going to get spooked.  Oh!  Oh, stop.  Shock jocks.  Schlock jocks. 
[03:25:30]  Schlock jocks.  You know, if you weren't so light,  maybe you'd hit on that humor.  Oh, I wanted to just say negro.  I know, Lars.  You've been a little niggardly with the compliments.  Now, well, Earl, by the way,  Opie took this down to a silver ticket,  because he's like,  uh, you think you got anything for Earl?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's right.  That's a bronze ticket.  Give the silver ticket back.  This was Opie's idea?  Yeah.  Oh, thanks, Opie.  We just wanted to get him off our backs. 
[03:26:00]  I can hang pictures myself.  You guys have been begging for a gig.  You guys take the colored fella.  Oh, there you go, Opie.  And the weird thing is, you know,  we do love Earl,  but we've never worked with him.  He's never worked with anybody.  He's been responsible the whole time we've known him.  Yeah.  And yet, he is still back there at N.E.W.  He's the one.  Everyone else that worked gave their lungs for the place.  This guy came in every day and worked and worked  and got thrown out the door. 
[03:26:30]  A parade of people.  You could have a parade of people  marched down the street  for all the people that were fired from that place.  It's true.  It was like the Buzz Bunny cartoon.  Yeah.  Dan, dan, dan.  Oh, I thought you meant that.  Dan, dan, dan.  I know, I know.  Dan, dan, dan.  Dan, dan, dan.  The conga line around the bases.  That's the strikeout line.  That's all the people that got fired from.  W.N.E.W., yeah.  Oh, that was the guys walking?  One, two, three, you're out.  One, two, three, you're out.  Oh, yeah.  Earl would call me.  We got fired,  and Earl would call me every single day.  It's been three years,  almost every day, 
[03:27:00]  going,  I'm getting fired.  It's just a matter of time now.  The act is coming down tomorrow.  Here it comes.  And I'm like,  Earl, you're a black guy in radio.  You'll never get fired.  Right.  Ever.  They don't fire people of color.  So, this song's about Earl?  It's about Earl  and what he's done  over the years  and the lives that he's touched,  and it's done to Patches,  which is probably the greatest soul song  of all time.  And Brother Joe actually made it better with this.  To understand a little more about Earl,  we once had Earl hang a picture 
[03:27:30]  His job was to hang a picture one day,  and it took him the entire day.  I'm not talking a mural.  This is an 8x10 photo in a frame already.  Just hang it.  And it took him.  He had to requisition hammers  and get tape measures  and try to level things.  And he was looking for a rope  and a noose,  and we're like,  not that type of hanging, Earl.  Not this time.  And he was never seen  without a giant two liter of ginger ale  and a bag of really cheap potato chips. 
[03:28:00]  Right.  And always at work,  but never working.  Never working.  And when you asked him,  what are you doing?  He would say,  I'm working on the public file.  And we never knew what that was,  but he was always working on it.  And he had jobs like  he was our shop steward.  Right.  And was in charge of the fire grill.  He was the safety guy for the floor.  And we're like,  what is that, Earl?  Well, if there's a fire,  I'm in charge.  Hey, what?  Remember when...  See him in a pot of smoke.  Remember, yeah.  Remember when there was smoke  in the building 
[03:28:30]  and you guys looked out the window  and he was all the way down  on the ground?  The guy who was supposed  to get everyone out.  He was supposed to get everyone out safely.  The guy has just lived.  He survives.  We called him the cockroach many times  because he just survives  through everyone else's cataclysms.  He had to hang the picture  on Martin Luther King Day,  by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Should we play the song?  Yeah.  He worked for Scott Muni,  who was a legend in radio.  He interned with Scott Muni  and never left the station, basically.  So without further ado,  here's Brother Joe  and his little song  about Black Earl. 
[03:29:00]  I was born and raised  in New York City  in a housing project  way up in the hood.  I dressed in dark clothing  so folks started  calling me Black Earl.  Oh, and they used to laugh about it  because deep down  they knew they'd call me that  because I was as black as shit.  I've always been a lazy man  A couch potato  with a clicker in my hand  See, motivation I never had  Hit in the shadows  when the boss got mad  But 20 years  I never got a raise  I'm 33 
[03:29:30]  and I've never been late  I look busy  but I'm not  I'm just walking around  I pick up some papers  and I put them back down  I'm damn gonna stop  paying my rent  Live in a refrigerator box  Never get out of bed  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum  I'll always make it through  Hard times at any W  Then one day 
[03:30:00]  some lame brains came  and took Owen A-way  And at the age of 33  I felt like I was carrying  the weight of the whole station  on my shoulders  And Ronnie Fessy knew  what I was going through  Every morning  I'd unlock the door  Lay down  and I'd sleep a little more  Then I'd put away  the bathroom key  Everybody was depending on me  I ate a chicken wing  with lemonade  Lord  Give me strength  to make another day 
[03:30:30]  Times I felt  I couldn't go on  Push a button  Throw a switch  Answer the phone  Got lost in the van  I did my PSAs  Ten minutes work  Gonna take me all day  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum  I'll always make it through  Hard times at any W  I could hear Scott's old say  Black girl  You're a genuine lazy bum 
[03:31:00]  You'll always make it through  Hard times at any W  Ten and Jeremy say  Black girl  You're a genuine lazy bum  Wow, that one is probably  the best song parody ever  Maybe ever  Sometimes I'll listen to that  just to my car  I know, I've done that  I've popped that in  and listened to it  just for the music value  I don't recognize 
[03:31:30]  the original though  Really?  I love that  Yeah, the original  We got a little patch  I don't know if I've ever  heard the original  This is probably one of  the most horrific  sad sax songs of all time  Who sings it?  Just gets worse and worse  for this colored boy  Clarence Carter?  Yeah, Clarence Carter  The same guy who did Stroking  Just a phenomenal performer  I was born and raised  down in Alabama  On a farm way back up  in the woods  You nailed it  I was like, I like it  Folks used to call me patches  Papa used to tease me  By the course deep down inside  He was hurt  because he'd done all he could  Our papa was a great old man 
[03:32:00]  I can see him  with a shovel in his hand seat  Education he never had  Of course not  He didn't want us  when the time got bad  The little money  from the crops he raised  Well, he pays the bills  Here's the bar  You don't remember?  Oh, that's right  Ossie didn't do it  Black girl 
[03:32:30]  He nailed it  Someone said that  The parody mentions  everything Earl ever did  True  In one song  It is true  Unlock the door  Sleep a little more  Bathroom key  It was his responsibility  Getting lost in the van  Oh, papa passed away  Yeah, everything happens  in this poor sad sack  Everything  And everything  He's got to do everything  He's ten  He's tilling the fields  You know he's packing  a huge cock 
[03:33:00]  And then one day  the angels came  and took mama away  He can't catch a fucking break  He's nothing  Basically Christopher Reeves' wife  Doing this story  Dana Reeves  Big black cock  with a nice little  sweat sheen on it  Why bring that up?  A big piece of  just a glorious gift  from God  shining there  Old britches  No reason  And his patched up  underalls  or coveralls  underalls  Underalls 
[03:33:30]  Wearing women's  panty line  Boy, if that's not  a fucking little  fantasy popping out  Alabama's  buck  wearing a panty  underpants  I want James Evans  in panties  Same  I got an update  on the paparazzi thing  Anthony  Oh?  To change subjects  drastically  Andrew in Brooklyn  Go ahead  Yeah, I just wanted  to let everyone know  that there's a picture  of Opie  and his lovely  young girlfriend  on nydailynews.com  Oh  It was for the  premiere of  The Constant Gardener 
[03:34:00]  last night  Well, look at that shot  Well, we explained  this earlier  Yeah, the paparazzi  was there to film  the stars going  into the premiere  and then they realized  I was there  and they went nuts  with their cameras  I haven't showered  in two days  and there's the shot  I made it up  on the website  great  You look beautiful  Yeah, that one's  going to do some damage  No, it should be there  Good  My name is Andrew  and I'm on the radio  You know what?  I really wish  that Lindsay  would have walked away  and then some real fatso 
[03:34:30]  would have walked up next to you  and they would have  snapped that shot  Oh, that would have been good  That would have been funny  I've been just trying  to keep the relationship  on the down low  That's all  But now it's out  in the open there  She looks mad  in that photo too  Oh, she hates  getting her picture taken  She looks really upset  Absolutely hates it  How do you get to that  from the daily news?  I don't know  There's a whole thing  where there's  the paparazzi  taking their pictures  and it pops up  on the website  Well, at least you're not  in a half shirt  and a feather boa  That's true  Always think about that 
[03:35:00]  It could always be worse  Yeah, there you go  Well, that's good  If I had a hot girl  I'd want everybody  to see the pictures  She just doesn't like  getting her picture taken  It's going to be  hell to pay later  But the way that face  it looks like  she's just about to say  Fuck you  You can see the teeth  are clenched  and the fuck  Oh, that's good  That's absolutely amazing  because she ran away  So I don't even know  how they got that one  I wonder if it was  another one from afar  or something  Whatever  There it is  Have fun

Well, everybody was  calling in to suck  Bob Sackett's dick  I waited on hold  to let Ron and Fez  know that I'm psyched  about them joining 202 
[03:39:00]  And Fez?  Yes  He got you  He got you  Yes  Must be a slow news day  CNN  Sex after 50  and they got Dr. Ruth on  Dr. Ruth  She looks good though  How does she still look exactly the same?  Dr. Ruth  Because I think a lot of women over 50  might go, why?  But you're talking about passion  Darren  Yes  Tell all of your viewers  She looks like Paul Williams  That sex  If people are sexually  Dr. Zayas  Dr. Zayas  Dr. Zayas 
[03:39:30]  Some of the changes  that Mary Jane is going to talk about  sex can go on  until the age of 99  What happens?  A hundred?  What happens?  You snatch full sound  You pull your dick out  and the vagina is attached to it  But the main thing is that  the brain  has to tell  women and men  That it's in  You don't even know  if the dick's in  unless your brain does it  because it's like  sticking your cock  out a window  are going to have more time  the kids are out of the house  that they should go  right after watching you 
[03:40:00]  back into bed  and having some good sex  if they know  Nazi sex  You know, she ran out  on our show as well  Dr. Ruth  She was at NAW  for another interview  I guess the normal interviews  they used to do upstairs  Oh yeah, right  And some of these  10-time wins  Some of these big celebs  would kind of wander downstairs  to where we were broadcasting  and the doors open  and we'd get her in  Our cleveroos  that were actually  a regular radio show  Tony Danza ran out  Dr. Ruth ran out  a few others  but Dr. Ruth came in  and I just  I said that 
[03:40:30]  she had a new book out  called Anal for Dummies  and she did not like that  at all and ran out  Didn't Tony Danza run out  because you had  two fat chicks  doing something with dildos  There was some  atrocious thing  that I wanted to walk out on  I think something was going on  and we came in  and wanted to promote some  I'll be singing opera  I think down at  some dive  Everything is not popular  Your tap dances  That's right  You could catch me juggling  I'm going to be juggling  in Times Square  It's fantastic 
[03:41:00]  Start of the jug band  Anything that people don't like  He starts  What is wrong with it?  Because it's not like  It's not  It's not  It's not easy  to learn tap dancing  Right  But no one wants to watch you do it  Who cares?  Tap dancing hasn't been popular  since slavery  Tap dancing is great  if you just don't want to be whipped  That's why you should learn  to tap dance  How about a little soft shoe?

You guys will learn that  I have no rules  They cut us off  It's a whole computer thing  because it's all computerized  and when the show ends  it's got to restart  So if we went five minutes later  when would the show restart?  Five minutes after that  then what happens at the end  now you're ten minutes  and before you know it  you've got to take a DeLorean  back to do the show over again  If that happens twelve times  you lose an hour  Right  Little math  You could lose two hours  if it's ten percent  Exactly 
[03:42:00]  And we're back  to the beginning point  See how we bring it all back  And goodnight everybody  Thank you  Ten percent of my half  plus ten percent of him half  I'm a math whiz  I'm a retard  So happy you made that mistake  I am a dope  I can't wait to listen  to the replay  just to listen  to your confidence  shattered mathematically  I know I'm an idiot  It never happens  But boy was that a blunder  You were off by half  and I'm thrilled  I was with Anthony  though  It made sense to me  I still think  he's making too much
