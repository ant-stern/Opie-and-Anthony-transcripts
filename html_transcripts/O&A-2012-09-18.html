<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts engaging in highly vulgar and sexually explicit banter before pivoting to a discussion of Mike Francesa falling asleep on air.  They recounted a similar incident where Anthony slept on air for 25 minutes, using music to cover it up, and played audio of Francesa's awkward attempts to explain his own on-air nap. Listeners then prank-called Francesa with sleep-related puns.  The show then transitioned to graphic descriptions and sexually explicit commentary regarding topless photos of Kate Middleton published in an Italian magazine, playing a news report on the subject.  The hosts expressed strong disdain for Occupy Wall Street protesters and their arrests on the one-year anniversary of the protests.  A detailed, vulgar discussion followed regarding a man who repeatedly masturbated on the New York City subway and received only probation.

The show then focused heavily on the leaked audio of Mitt Romney's disparaging remarks about 47% of Americans.  This segment included discussion with guest Stunt Brain from The Blaze, speculating on the timing of the leak and its possible connections to Middle Eastern events and the rumored release of the "blind sheik."  They also discussed a rumored damaging Obama tape allegedly held by the L.A. Times.  A significant portion of the show centered on 9/11, particularly the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7, with clips of Jesse Ventura's appearance on Piers Morgan expressing skepticism about the official investigation and insinuating government complicity. The hosts debated Ventura's claims using crude and offensive language.  The "F.U.'s" segment featured callers leaving vulgar and insulting messages. The hosts also recounted an anecdote involving repeatedly "fake raping" guest Will Fouts for comedic effect.  Finally, various pop culture trivia related to anniversaries was briefly touched upon.

Comedian Bill Burr joined the show next.  The discussion started with satirical commentary on the President's low salary and security concerns, moving into an absurd debate about the planet's water supply.  They returned to the leaked Romney audio, dissecting his comments and the mediaâ€™s response, mocking the political process and the communication styles of various politicians, including Romney and Obama.  The NHL lockout, baseball's steroid era, and NFL replacement referees were also discussed, along with speculation about juiced baseballs and officiating fairness.  The segment ended with discussion of Burr's podcast and stand-up shows, and a brief, humorous on-air interview with a costumed listener.

A discussion about a tell-all book harshly criticizing Joe Kennedy followed, speculating on his Prohibition-era business dealings and debating the concept of karma within the Kennedy family.  This led to discussions of flappers, speakeasies, the Roaring Twenties, and a comedic performance they disliked, criticizing Jimmy Durante's style.  The hosts then shared gossip and crude jokes about Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Johnny Carson, and Joan Rivers, with a caller adding unverified gossip about Lucille Ball.  Mike Rowe then joined the show, recounting an awkward previous encounter with Victoria Gotti who had monopolized a previous broadcast reading from her book for hours.  The conversation then shifted to Rowe's new Discovery Channel show, "How Booze Built America," exploring alcohol's impact on American history.  Rowe discussed details about his other shows, "Dirty Jobs" and "Deadliest Catch," including anecdotes about filming, cast members, and near-death experiences, and shared a story about a claustrophobic opal mining experience in Australia.

Mike Rowe returned in a later segment, recounting adventurous anecdotes from his career including tomb raiding and shark cage diving, highlighting near-death experiences and humorous mishaps.  He discussed shark cage safety and incidents of injuries due to carelessness.  Victoria Gotti's previous appearance and Rowe's abrupt departure were mentioned.  The conversation shifted to Rowe's show "How Booze Built America," described as containing "cross-dressing, bad language, juvenile humor, adult situations, and wall-to-wall drinking."  The hosts also previewed "Jocktober," a recurring segment mocking local radio shows, utilizing audience participation via social media attacks.  Past Jocktober highlights were discussed, along with a preview of the next day's guests: Damien Echols, Penny Marshall, and Carl Urban.  The segment concluded with a clip of Anthony falling asleep on air, speculation on the show's future, and whether their contracts would be renewed.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the Arby and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent. 
[00:00:30]  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to talk about.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in a day, every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make a fucking second?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  Hey, asshole.  Just take the joke and take a little beating.  It'll be okay.  Anthony, the rage.  I feel like dog shit.  If I'm sick, I'm fucking off and my agent has to be called by the rag down the fucking hall.  And Jim Norton, lover of transvestites.  How do you not look at a cock if it's there?  I'm not gay or anything, but for Pete's sake, I'm not rude.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Goddamn.  Oh, greetings, salutations, everybody.  Two for Tuesday.  Is it?  It's two for Tuesday already.  A twofer.  I believe Jocktober's almost upon us. 
[00:02:00]  Jocktober.  Wow.  Nice.  Seems like that month just keeps coming around and around and around, doesn't it?  Round and round we go.  Wowie kazowie.  Right off the bat, we want to talk about Mike Francesa.  Yes.  We're obsessed with Mike Francesa and the fact that he fell asleep on his own radio show.  It happens.  Hey, you know, I don't think there's any excuse for it. 
[00:02:30]  It happens.  You come in on a daily basis to do a program and you owe it to the listeners.  And the company.  And the company.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah.  To just be on the ball.  Have your sleep the night before.  Get a good night's sleep.  And be full of what I call piss and vinegar every day when you come in on the radio show.  There you go.  Well, the video of him falling asleep went viral.  Made all the sports blogs.  Yeah.  And it's so obvious he fell asleep. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  He was out for, I don't know, it seemed like almost 30 seconds.  Yeah, he was out.  And then he pops up.  It's a visual, obviously.  He pops his eyes up and looks around the room like, what the hell's going on?  Like, oh my God, I was just out of it.  Like when you're driving and all of a sudden you doze and you wake up and you're looking  out the windshield like, oh my God, I could have crashed.  Yeah.  Oh.  Hey, that's somebody else sleeping on the air.  Wow, there's Anthony sleeping on the air.  Hey, yeah.  Oh my God. 
[00:03:30]  I really do.  Oh, you're talking about today?  Just in general?  Look at me.  I got my feet up.  Another four minutes later?  I had my feet.  That was 2007?  Yeah, that's five years ago already.  Yeah, that's five years.  Holy fuckaroni.  Well, those chairs were really comfortable in that studio.  Oh, were they comfy chairs?  And one by one, we all left the studio.  Look, now they're panning around in an empty studio as you're still on the air,  completely asleep.  Now it's another 10 minutes later.  I was tired.  The music is playing and the headphones. 
[00:04:00]  We put the music on.  Yeah.  Yeah, that kept me sleeping really, really nicely.  Oh, was I tired?  Yeah.  Anyway, it happens.  It's impressive to see that big, beautiful studio.  Oh, I know.  It's conducive to snoozing in that studio.  It sure is.  It's conducive to football, fucking soccer, whatever else we wanted to do.  Great, great chairs.  25 minutes later.  Come on.  Anthony was out on the air 25 minutes, and we just put on the background music, which  you're hearing.  Was that after the show ended, obviously?  No. 
[00:04:30]  No, you don't remember this?  We left at like nine.  We literally left and just kept your mic on as you snoozed away.  Oh, there I go.  And then you finally wake up, and that's the Mike Francesa look.  You're looking around like, what the fuck?  Now I'm smiling like, oh, boy.  You're trying to be cool.  Now I know I did something.  Better shake my head.  Now you're shaking your head.  Oh, boy.  You look like Roy Scheider in that moment.  I really was.  And now you're waving at people who are still there.  Me and Jimmy are long gone. 
[00:05:00]  Yes.  You're looking around like, okay.  Oh, man.  Jimmy's gone.  Because now I'm just trying to figure out how long I've been there.  And you're like, my headphones are on.  I'm in front of a mic.  And now he is awake and throws his headphones.  I should have known.  Yeah.  To the hyenas.  He pulls a mic out of the thing.  I know. 
[00:05:30]  Hey.  The line of the day is brought to you by bowdoggfantasy.net.  So, anyway.  Wow.  Yeah.  You were out.  And then we one by one left.  We put the music on.  Kept the mic on.  That's something you can't do on regular radio.  No.  Whoa.  That was close.  Oh, boy.  We got to spill.  We got to spill.  There you go.  We got to spill. 
[00:06:00]  A little spill.  Yeah.  Thank God for those lids.  Carlo.  Oh, something happened here.  Carlo.  Something happened here.  It's so great.  He spills that drink all over that woman.  Yeah.  Let's you bums get involved with it.  Come here, darling.  Darling.  Yo, something happened here.  He cugs the guy's wife and spills her drink.  That was so perfect.  It was a disaster.  I always go to the Canadian PSA when coffee is spilled on itself.  He spilled my coffee.  You bitch.  Francesca is just a humorless douchebag. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  He's a douchebag.  He can't laugh at himself.  That's the point here.  And that's why we love his listeners.  I would imagine we have some crossover with Mike Francesca's audience.  We love his listeners.  So, basically, he falls asleep.  It's so obvious he fell asleep.  And he's still denying that he fell asleep.  Matter of fact, I think I got the clip.  We haven't played this yet.  Believe me, this is going somewhere very funny.  But first, we have to go to Mike Francesca.  Try and explain to his audience that he did not fall asleep, even though the video went viral. 
[00:07:00]  And it's pretty damn obvious to pretty much everyone that he did.  I wasn't going to address this.  And often, I don't like wasting your time and my time with nonsense.  But since it has become a story, it was in the paper today.  You know, and the only reason I'm doing this is because my wife won't talk to me until I do it.  How about you just do it because it's funny and it happened and it's something everyone's talking about?  What a douche.  He's not a funny guy and he's boring. 
[00:07:30]  And that's why people hate him because he's a smart sports guy.  But he can't just go out and make fun of himself and go, what an ass I am.  I fell asleep.  I was up all night.  Right, right.  My wife said to 12, I guess so.  He's like a giant, just a slug.  Just a big, dumb slug.  Yeah, it made all the New York papers.  I forgot about that, too.  It was a huge story last week.  Huge.  So here he is.  My wife won't talk to me until I do it.  Sunday, when we opened the season up with the NFL now, I did what I usually do. 
[00:08:00]  I got up 6 o'clock Sunday morning, came in here, did the NFL now.  Went home, watched football.  By the time my day's over, it's 1 o'clock in the morning.  I'm fishing up after watching Denver and Peyton Manning, which was a pleasure, sitting there  in my office watching that on Sunday night.  And then, as happens sometimes, you know, when your kids get sick, which happened, and one  of my sons suffers from asthma, Jack.  And recently, as the weather changes, he has some exercise-induced asthma. 
[00:08:30]  And I didn't get to sleep Sunday night.  So, you know, that happens as a parent.  I mean, luckily, I have healthy kids, and, you know, sometimes it happens.  Now, when my wife got mad at me, it's because I didn't mention this when I came in here on  Monday.  And Monday morning, when I put the kids to school, which I do every morning, I put them  on a school bus.  Jesus, what an explanation.  What a long-winded fucking explanation.  Now it just sounds excuse-y.  He's a good parent.  So what?  Yeah.  Big deal. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  It's like, instead of just coming in and going out, like, yeah, my kid was sick, I was  up.  He has to bring his son's medical condition on the air to excuse his own fucking sleepiness.  Exactly.  That's what he's doing.  Good dick.  He can't show weakness.  By the way, I listen to this, and I go, holy fuck, the guy that does Mike Francesa for  us?  Perfect, dude.  Holy fuck.  He's perfect.  Oh, my God.  With, okay.  It's him.  Okay.  It's him.  Okay.  All right.  School, which I do every morning, I put them on a school bus.  She was fighting with me not to go leave early, which I did, and she said, you better 
[00:09:30]  get some sleep because you haven't slept.  You can't go into a show.  And I said, ah, I've done it a million times.  And she's like, you know, you're not 20 anymore.  Well, I came in.  I hadn't slept all night.  And obviously, I was dragging during the show, which led to me closing my eyes during  a Sweeney Murdy interview and causing this hurrah, which none of us here knew about until  yesterday, because people now accuse me of being asleep during a Sweeney because I closed  my eyes during the interview, which I shouldn't have done.  And I was exhausted.  I hadn't slept the night before. 
[00:10:00]  Okay.  And I maybe I've done that many times through the years.  I mean, 25 years, I can tell you, not just when my kids were born, but many times.  I mean, Dog and I did 25 hours in a row.  There were many nights where I have come in here and not slept all night and done a show.  But I can promise you this.  I did close my eyes during a Sweeney interview for a minute, and it was on TV.  And that's become this big bone of contention, because I guess everything we do on the show  does.  But I can promise you, as you can go listen to the interview, I was never asleep.  I promise you. 
[00:10:30]  So I promise I'll never close my eyes again, nor will I come in without sleeping, because  my wife says you can't do that anymore.  So obviously, she and Sherry, who knew about this, said, go in there and tell them what happened.  And I'm like, nobody's business.  But since it now has become a story, that is exactly what happened.  But just admit, you fell asleep.  Yeah.  That's falling asleep.  I shut my eyes, you know.  Well, his explanation just made it worse, is what we're getting at, because now people 
[00:11:00]  are pranking him.  This is so fucking funny.  If he had just laughed it off, nobody would want to prank him.  No one would care.  Yeah.  He would own it, and that would be it.  It wouldn't be fun to prank him.  But knowing he's such a curmudgeon.  Right.  About the whole thing.  So open and susceptible to prank, people are doing it.  Yeah.  And if we do share the same audience here and there, I hope you guys continue this, because  we're howling over here today.  People love it.  And the fact that it's televised.  Yeah.  Like, you go on YouTube and just watch this. 
[00:11:30]  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  So we found two YouTube clips.  We got the first one here.  The listeners of his radio show are not going to let this go, because he wasn't honest.  Yeah.  He should have just said, all right, I fucking fell asleep.  Yeah, I fell asleep.  Whatever.  Ken on the call phone.  What's up, Ken?  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  Good.  I just want to talk about how I don't think the Mets are going to re-sign David Wright.  But real quick, I also know you're a big movie buff. 
[00:12:00]  And for the kids, you should probably watch the Smurfs, because they probably love Sleepy.  It's just like their dad.  You know what I'm saying?  Another real good joke.  Yeah.  No, it's great.  Yeah, another real good joke here.  He just can't laugh at himself.  He's so cranky.  We would ride this for a week.  Oh, yeah.  And just beat the fuck out of whatever it happens to.  Have production put around it.  Of course.  Snoring sounds put in while people were talking.  Oh, sorry.  I fell asleep.  It's the famous throwing someone under a bus, man. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Everyone gets a turn at that shit.  Is there more of that call?  Do you have more of the Smurf call?  Oh, yeah.  Where he goes into the, oh, there you go.  He's an asshole.  That's a joke, because that really ties into our audience, because we've got a lot of  five- and six-year-olds listening in our audience, you know?  It really does work.  It really hit the audience right on the head, because that really is our core audience, the  five- and six-year-olds, you know?  Right after they get out of nursery school, they're dying to get to the phones and get to  the show.  Well, Charlie in Queens. 
[00:13:00]  What's up, Charlie?  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, Dylan.  What's up?  That NFL Network, Mike, it's a snooze fest anyway.  That NFL Network, half the time, come on.  No, you need games.  They've got games every week now on it, though.  Well, but I'm saying, when there's not a game on it, then...  Yeah, but now they have a game every week.  Now, but then nine months out of the year, it's a real snooze fest.  It's better off MSG Network.  You watch old Sleepy Floyd, Akeem the Dream, you know what I mean?  The Dream.  And that guy wanting Paterno would be in trouble.  Let's see how many references you can make that the audience realizes what you're doing. 
[00:13:30]  What do you think, Charlie?  The guy was fast.  The guy was fast.  What a fool.  What a fool.  People are just stupid.  I mean, they're just silly.  They really are.  Justin in Queens.  What's up, Justin?  Hey, what's up, Mike?  What's happened?  Listen, I'm in the car listening, and I just heard the interview with O'Hater.  Mm-hmm.  By any chance, did you fall asleep?  Okay.  Anything else you want to add?  No, I've got to be honest.  Your eyes were hilarious on that thing.  Anything else you want to add?  Mike, Mike, it was priceless.  Mike.  Anything else you want to add? 
[00:14:00]  I do, but Mike, your eyes were priceless.  And he's having fun with him going, look, it was Mike.  It was priceless.  Come on.  Yeah, and he still won't budge.  He won't.  He still won't get that stick out of his ass.  He can't just laugh it off.  Anything else you want to add?  Mike.  Mike, it was priceless.  Do you?  Anything else you want to add?  I do, but Mike.  Do you want to add anything else?  I'm asking you.  I asked you once and I asked you again.  Do you want anything else you want to add?  Yeah, I do.  Okay.  Mike, the eyes were priceless, Mike.  I'm glad you liked that 10-second video. 
[00:14:30]  If that's what you take out of 25 years of my career, well, you know what?  That's kind of sad, but it speaks to you, not me.  And you sat there an hour to say that.  An hour to make that point.  But I hope you had a good time because it didn't bother me at all.  Kenny and Brooklyn, because I'm still going to be here tomorrow.  It did bother him.  It really did.  It bothered him a lot.  It didn't bother me at all.  Of course it bothered him.  No, I think it did.  That was the last guy, wasn't it?  On that clip.  I think they go to somebody else.  You sure? 
[00:15:00]  What a humorless douche.  But I hope you had a good time because it didn't bother me at all.  Kenny and Brooklyn, because I'm still going to be here tomorrow, the next day, the next  day and get paid a fortune to sit here and do this.  So just remember that.  Kenny and Brooklyn, what's up?  Just remember that.  What a cocksucker.  He really is a douchebag.  I get paid a fortune to do this.  Yeah, fortune to sit here.  Well, then don't fall asleep, cocksucker.  Stay away from your fortune, shithead.  Shit.  And now there's another video online.  So far there's two of these that you can search out. 
[00:15:30]  We'll put it on our Facebook page there.  You rock.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Here's the second one.  Thank you.  Before the Jets played last week, you know, I heard nothing but, you know, everybody going  off on the Jets and how they're not preseason and so forth and so on.  And basically, the guy looked Montana-like on Sunday.  I would be, I would be, I would, I would really, I would really kind of hold off on the Montana 
[00:16:00]  comparisons, okay?  You know?  And let's be honest.  I don't want you to get an on-go-lip.  The Bills, the Bills, the Bills, the Bills, the Bills, you know, you know, I've been doing  this show, I've been doing this show for 25 years.  All right, hold on, hold on.  You know how he, he just, he got stopped dead in his tracks.  Yeah, he's trying to just move.  He's trying to talk about the Bills.  He's even trying to move on after he says the Bills, the Bills, but his mind, you can  tell, just he couldn't think of anything else but this motherfucker. 
[00:16:30]  But it doesn't bother him.  It's not bothering him at all.  No, it doesn't bother him.  Rewind that.  It's so funny.  Listen to how he tries to plow through and then he's just like, this cocksucker.  You know, it's going to get a lot worse now.  Please don't stop.  It's going to get a lot worse.  Oh, hilarious.  If we've got some of those listeners listening to us, please continue.  That's hilarious.  Please, we want to play these tomorrow.  Because one of you guys will get him really going.  He will lose his fucking mind.  The Bills, you know, I've been doing this show for 25 years, five and a half hours a 
[00:17:00]  day, and now we're going to talk about 12 seconds, okay, when I was up all night.  So that makes a lot of sense.  We've been doing this show twice.  Why don't you add up the hours, you jerk.  25 hours.  Well, you know what?  Yes.  Mike on Long Island.  What's up, Mike?  Yes, Mike.  Oh, sorry about that.  I fell asleep when you started talking about two years.  No, no, no.  You know, listen.  I'm not.  Listen.  Once the next one is gone. 
[00:17:30]  Well, you're gone anyway, because I'm not in the mood.  Mel and B.  Go ahead, Mel.  Mike, I'll give you a dud.  I love that one, too, because the guy that I called had a whole bit.  Yeah.  He's like, all right, I'm going to wait until he answers, but then I won't say anything.  And then I'll be like, oh, I fell asleep.  And then he's like, you're gone anyway.  Yeah, but the guy had no real fucking question.  He was just trying to prank you.  I like how he goes.  The next guy is gone, and he goes, no, wait, you're gone, too.  Yeah.  Am I?  Yeah.  You're fired.  I'm fired?  No, you're not fired.  You're fired. 
[00:18:00]  How great is that?  That is making us howl this morning.  Oh, fucking Mikey.  What a douche he is, Francesca.  How about you just chuckle a little bit to Mikey?  A little bit, Mikey.  A little bit.  Mikey.  It won't hurt.  They wouldn't do it if he just acknowledged it and owned it and goes, yeah, you know what?  I was up.  I'm an ass.  And just goofed on himself a little and laughed at one call.  Have a whole segment about it and just fucking run with it.  Play snoring sound once in a while.  Yeah, let the listeners get it out of their system, and that's it. 
[00:18:30]  Let them beat you up a little bit, and then they'll be done with it.  Is there any more clips?  Those are the two I found last night.  He's the best guy to prank because he's such a twat.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I bet it's impossible to fall asleep like when he was working with Mad Dog, though.  Try to fall asleep with that.  Hey, we're talking about the Yankees baseball now today.  Oh, you're getting a half game up.  You just go, shut up.  Holy shit.  I can't sleep.  Mad Dog was his Red Bull.  Yeah.  Holy fuck. 
[00:19:00]  How do you deal with that in your ear for 20-some odd years?  Shut up.  Let's take some phone calls.  One time, me and Dog.  Me and Dog.  Shut up.  Dog.  Well, you know Dog.  If you find any more, let us know there, Sam.  He's very flustered, though, that Mike Francesa.  Yeah.  He doesn't want to show any weakness ever.  No, no.  He's the consummate broadcaster, and he'll remind you of that at every turn. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  Good for him.  I want to see these tits, man.  What?  Native tits on the cover of all the papers today.  Native tits.  Why do you want to?  Why?  Because I think it brings me back to, you know, a kid when that's what you got to see at first.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  National Geographic.  Yeah, it was rarely.  I guess Kate Middleton and that Prince Charles.  I don't know what these two do.  They just travel around. 
[00:20:00]  They just travel around.  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  Prince William.  I can't even keep their name straight.  Prince William.  And they just talk, and you know these people have real problems when they're talking to  these two, hoping for something, not knowing these two can't do shit.  They're nothing.  Except look good and just travel around together.  They were on the Solomon Islands, I gather.  Where are the Solomon Islands?  The Solomons would be South Pacific.  South Pacific?  Right?  Isn't that the South Pacific?  Well, they're natives.  Didn't we fight over the Solomon Islands years ago? 
[00:20:30]  I don't know.  I think we did.  I know this much.  The Solomon Islands, the natives, they go topless.  And you know what?  Not bad.  Really?  They're fucking...  Not bad.  Ah, dude.  They're very...  Not bad.  But they have black bars on all the fucking nipples and stuff.  So I'm trying to get the unedited shots.  They are very dark.  They look like...  Problem?  They're from African descent.  Problem?  No, not a problem if you're into that.  The side tits on the front page are pretty nice. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, there you go.  That's the side tit.  And they keep middleton, because she's going.  She's going through her fucking topless picture fucking scandals, all like, oh my god, I  can't believe I'm seeing this.  Yeah, she's all like, oh goodness gracious, that's a heavy tit.  It's heavy, but it's not sinking.  That's why I want to see it unedited.  I love the fact that her and William don't even walk on the sand.  They have a thing they walk on, so when they're...  Oh god, they can't walk on the dirt.  No, because they don't want to wreck their really nice shoes.  Especially her nice shoes. 
[00:21:30]  Ew, dude, look at her nibs.  Oh, they're blurry a little.  Yeah, they're blurry.  Relax.  What are they blurred out for?  You thought they were all chewed out, right?  No, you can see the placement of them are very low.  All the broads aren't bad.  Does nothing for me.  They're midgets.  Not bad.  They look a little short.  They're midget fucking pygmies.  Look at those.  Why are they hanging out with topless broads?  What's going on?  I don't know.  This stupid royal family.  They're in a silly boat.  Oh, there's a video.  Play the video.  Oh yeah, let's see this.  Aren't the Olympics over? 
[00:22:00]  What gives a fuck?  What are they trying to sell the DVD now or something?  Are they?  Is that what this is about?  I don't remember the Olympics.  That was like last week's news.  Oh my God.  Why?  What are they doing with the Olympics?  Long-winded fucking...  It's a commercial for what?  Commercial.  Why a DVD?  Oh, it's on Blu-ray.  Why would you buy that shit? 
[00:22:30]  Reuters.  A traditional welcome for a princess in the Solomon Islands.  Nice.  As the royal tour continues, topless women present necklaces to Britain's Prince William and his  wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, formerly Kate Middleton.  At the same time, on the other side of the world, semi-naked pictures of the future queen  are hitting newsstands in an Italian gossip magazine.  In an Italian gossip magazine.  Italy's key magazine has a large topless image of the Duchess on its front page.  The headline says...  What do they do that for?  ...called the Queen is naked. 
[00:23:00]  But most Italians weren't too shocked.  I think the reaction is exaggerated.  All this talk about them being royals.  Nowadays, we are all equal.  It is absolutely...  Bafango.  I'm the only man loving my village.  I don't even know where...  I don't even know where...  Everybody I know is dead.  I don't care about kids.  They'll get shot off if they come by my house.  The Duchess of the Duchess have already been printed by the French... 
[00:23:30]  Dutchess.  ...being closer.  The royal couple are launching legal action against the publication, saying...  Every black guy with gray hair looks like Nelson Mandela.  ...seeking an injunction on damages.  For now, at least, their Jubilee tour is being somewhat overshadowed...  Yeah, look, they can't walk on the dirt.  ...the images have been picked up by several foreign publications.  So royal family.  So hateable, right?  ...continues to circulate widely on the internet.  She's beautiful, though.  Yeah, she's a knockout.  I don't like the way those English newscasters talk.  The Duchess. 
[00:24:00]  The Duchess.  The Duchess.  Topless pictures of her.  We're in a magazine.  Especially if you've got graphic there showing her big, thicker-than-average nipples...  ...and down to her pouty pussy lips.  The pouty lips of her sex.  Pouty pussy lips.  ...she's pretty much flat-chested, though.  Not much going on there.  Oh, I like her, too.  Little bees, I would gather.  Yeah, little bees.  The side view looked a little good.  I think the side, they look nice.  Yeah.  That picture we're looking at now, they're a bit pancake-ish.  Very kissable girl. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Hello, Kate.  What was the headline on the New York paper?  Wow.  Because they have to, like, work in the word tit and breast and bosom.  Yes, red-faced Kate meets bosom buddy, all a-titter.  I mean...  And then they get mad at people for, you know, because they're so...  Cheeky.  Their integrity is amazing, impeccable, the New York Post.  So when something happens and they want to dive on somebody for doing something, you know, sexual... 
[00:25:00]  Right.  How do they have any credibility when they make two tit jokes on the front page?  It's just cheeky shit.  Cheeky.  Oh, it's a bit cheeky.  Cheeky.  Cheeky.  That's nice.  Yeah, that view is nice.  A little side view with the, I don't know, reversed arc going on with her back.  Yeah, yeah.  She's kind of hunched over almost.  She's arched over.  Frontwards.  Those look weighty.  Yeah.  Like, picture that.  You can picture it going like this. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  Picture holding them and pushing up on them.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  When you lift them, your bicep vein comes out.  Because that's a big, heavy tit.  Yeah, that's a big, heavy titty.  The sound of the boob.  What do you want to hear again?  There was like a...  That's about it, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Just a little.  You want to tap the side and hear...  What's a bad one?  The little rascal's cake. 
[00:26:00]  You don't want that sound.  I think it's...  That's all.  That's it.  It should move too much.  Yeah, exactly.  Another bad sound is...  Heedle, heedle.  Yeah.  Heedle, heedle. 
[00:26:30]  Heedle, heedle, heedle.  This is very small.  They arrested 100 Occupy Wall Street protesters during the one-year anniversary demonstrations.  Oh, these fucking wastes.  Now, I got videos that go back over a year, so why are they marking it as the one-year anniversary?  I don't get that.  What is the big day?  Why was today or yesterday the big day?  Today's the one-year anniversary, or yesterday was the one-year anniversary, but I was filming  shit down there in July of last year, so I don't get it.  It wasn't an official fucking demonstration until a year ago yesterday. 
[00:27:00]  I heard on the news, they were talking to some of these people.  Oh, God.  You know, in the year, I felt I've grown as a person so much with this movement.  Shut up with your movement.  I made a more fucking credible movement in my turlin bowl.  Fuck them.  There was one asshole that had a donut on a string.  Oh, what was that about?  I absolutely support the NYPD, but it was slightly funny because it was on a pole. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, for the cops.  Yeah, it's in the paper.  It's one of the pictures they're showing today from the...  Right.  Well, the cops fucking were just zip-stripping these idiots.  Well, they should have just hammered that guy.  Yeah.  Ah, I don't get it.  But then you got the guys screaming as they're getting arrested.  What the fuck?  You know, I get arrested in some other country.  Because they're used to being getting what they...  They're like, most of them are privileged suburban children who are not used to actually 
[00:28:00]  being told what to do.  That's how they got everything, by screaming their whole life, eh, no!  Ugh.  Don't piss the eyes.  Jesus Christ.  You don't like them.  No, I hate the Occupy people.  Oh, do I hate them.  I mean, there's, you know, there's obviously some kind of message that you want to put  out there about Wall Street.  That's fine.  You know?  You don't think they're being fair.  I don't know.  But this entitled group here is just pathetic. 
[00:28:30]  They're pathetic.  They're hypocrites to the umpteenth degree.  I love them zip strip cuffs.  So what happens now with these people?  Are we hearing yelling?  Sam?  Did you resist arrest?  Listen, he's talking to the rest.  You want to say that?  I'm sorry.  I doubt it.  The whole world is not the same.  The whole world is not the same.  The whole world is not the same. 
[00:29:00]  The whole world is not the same.  The whole world is not the same.  The whole world is not the same.  I'm not the same.  I'm not the same.  I don't know.  Was that guy trying to say the whole world is watching?  Oh, God.  That sort of worked a year ago.  That's so last year, man.  It really is.  He was big off your high tits.  Occupying that shirt nicely.  Nice.  Yes.  Man.  Listen, back up with those cameras. 
[00:29:30]  Someone's going to get hit in the head with that camera.  He's threatening.  Oh.  He was going to say whole world again.  Oh, God.  They are so pleasant when they arrest those people.  How about a nice fucking Mid-Eastern protest arrest?  Man. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, now they're saying over 180 arrests.  All right.  So they arrested everyone that showed up.  It's a pretty decent crowd down there.  Hundreds.  It was just hundreds?  Yeah.  The videos I saw was pretty impressive.  I think they were expected a lot more, but I think people were over that cause and move  on to the next one.  Yeah, move on to the next cause.  What is the next cause?  What's going on in the world that we need that cause?  Is it the elections too big right now for a new cause? 
[00:30:30]  Whoa, we're only a month.  Where's Coney?  Did they catch him yet?  We're only a month and a half out now, man.  What happened in April when everybody, for this Coney thing, you were supposed to send  for your Coney kit, right?  And then I think April, somewhere in April, on a designated day, everyone would wake up,  go outside, and holy shit, Coney posters were everywhere.  It was like taking over.  Yeah, yeah.  And that was going to let everybody know. 
[00:31:00]  No, that was last April.  You don't remember?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh.  No one gave a flying fuck-a-rooney.  Was that a bust-a-roo, you think?  Oh, what a bust-a-roo.  Well, he went crazy.  It was such a bust-a-roo.  Yeah, the guy decided, I'm just going to go out on a sidewalk, take my clothes off and  jack off.  I'm just going to jack it naked on a sidewalk.  You want to talk about the whole world was watching that guy.  Yes.  What has he decided to get completely naked and jacked off? 
[00:31:30]  Yes.  Wouldn't you keep that shit on the QT for a little while when all eyes are on you?  No, I actually think that's the best thing you could do, because it's the one thing they'll  remember.  Yeah, just tug your pug.  Oh, that guy was classic.  Tugging his pug.  Yeah, he's pulling his prick in front of everybody.  Speaking of pulling your prick, there's a guy that, I think he's been caught three times  on the subway, jacking it, and everyone's pissed off because he just got probation, three  years probation.  I guess they don't see that a big crime. 
[00:32:00]  I know, but that's the type of guy that will fucking eventually grab somebody.  Yeah, yeah.  Subway pervs free to grind.  State lawmakers, prosecutors, and women are outraged that a chronic pervert who masturbated  on three subway riders.  I apologize to the ladies.  To me, it's just kind of funny in writing.  We got these, what's called cocks, and guys just can't fucking, they just want to share  them with women.  I know it's a horrible crime, but when you read it, it just sounds funny. 
[00:32:30]  A chronic pervert who masturbated on three subway riders got off with no prison time.  Courtesy, it says, courtesy to the state's highest court.  How, uh, how is he doing off on them?  Darnell Hardware.  Was he rubbing on them?  The name always works out.  Darnell Hardware.  Hardware.  27 got three years probation last week because Court of Appeals judges ruled earlier this year  that subway grinders, as they are called by law enforcement, can't be charged with felonies  if they don't use force to pursue their repulsive perversion. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, so you could just, uh, kind of cozy up next to a chick and rub your boner on her  and, and it's okay as long as you don't grab her and hold her there.  She has the ability to leave.  And as long as you're not menacing her, I guess.  How do you have the ability to leave if you're on a packed subway train?  That's true.  I would argue for the defense.  Does she have the ability then to just reach, grab his testicles and crunch them with her  hand? 
[00:33:30]  That'd be a good one.  In other words, it's gross, but it's not violent.  Yeah.  So I guess the problem is it's not a felony.  You'd open up the door to somebody saying, uh, hey, that guy was grinding on me.  When you're just in a crowded subway, it's kind of hard to distinguish, you know, unless  you're really just kind of humping.  Was he tugging or was he just grinding?  It looks like he's, uh, kind of, yeah, grinding.  The court system has let him get away scot-free, said Nicholas, or Nicola, excuse me, 40, of 
[00:34:00]  Manhattan, who has faced down a subway grinder before.  It's a slap on the wrist, honestly.  I do not think the punishment did fit the crime.  Oh.  Yeah, I don't think so either, man.  No.  He should fucking, uh, he should get a little more than that.  And prosecutors say dozens of subway sickos have walked away from charges.  So we could just do this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam, uh, what do you say?  You go out on the subway for the show and just start grinding that cock of yours.  No, just wear tight pants so your ass becomes a magnet for them. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, or let guys, yeah, grind on you.  You should be our, what do you call it?  Decoy.  Yes.  Yes.  Listen to this.  In Hardware's case, the pervert has indeed been prolific with a rap sheet that includes  32 arrests, including two sexual assault cases in the Bronx of Brooklyn.  This guy's going to rape someone.  He's a piece of shit.  He hasn't already.  He's going to rape.  What's going on with our court system?  Let's fucking get rid of this guy already.  Just don't have any place to put these idiots?  Stack them on top of each other.  Who gives a fuck?  There's no fucking cure for a sex criminal. 
[00:35:00]  There isn't.  They will continue to do this.  Until you get him.  Sure.  Oh, shit.  All right.  The article gets a little hot, everyone.  All right.  Let's all relax here.  Mind if I, uh, I, uh, sidle up to Jimmy and start grinding on his leg?  There you go.  Whatever I do.  And I'll, I'll put the top, I'll aim my heart on up and press it against the console so I  have, I get some friction pre-cum chain reaction.  The recent subterranean charges stem from three incidents in, uh, Manhattan between 2003 and 
[00:35:30]  2005.  When Hardware, so these, these cases go way the fuck back too.  When Hardware rubbed himself to orgasm.  Whoa.  This isn't a crime when you're fucking spilling jizz.  Now, how did people know that?  Uh, rubbed himself to orgasm on two young women aged 22 and 24 and a 17 year old high  school student.  Whoa.  He's a piece of shit.  Yeah.  He's a piece of shit.  Whoa.  Maybe he yelled, I'm coming.  I mean, you were trying to come quietly.  It's very hard.  Yeah.  You always give yourself away.  He's like, if you're coming through, if you're all right, you're, you didn't take it 
[00:36:00]  out, but you're grinding up against women and you're coming.  That's not a felony.  Yeah.  How is that?  In a crowded subway.  Hey, what is wrong with our system?  How encouraging she could feel, uh, she could feel what was happening, but was powerless,  powerless to move palace.  She felt what was happening.  Yeah.  Hardware powerless to move.  Come on.  We usually only read the first paragraph or two, but this is kind of fascinating because 
[00:36:30]  it says, Hardware could thank fellow perv Jason Mack for his freedom.  In 2002, the 300 pound Mack rubbed against a 14 year old girl in a packed downtown, uh,  one train.  But it wasn't until 2009 that his DNA was linked to the crime.  Mack confessed to the perversion, but judge Renee White threw out a felony charge because  there was no proof the girl felt threatened with violence.  This is fucked up.  Are you kidding me?  14 year old girl he rubs his dick on.  A 300 pound guy. 
[00:37:00]  What is wrong with that judge?  The judge, I was shit out.  I wonder if somebody rubbed on her in an elevator.  That judge, Renee, I'm guessing is a woman.  I wonder if she'd feel threatened.  Right.  Of course, of course, the girl felt threatened.  I imagine that the judge would take it differently if it was her asshole being rubbed against.  Some fuck lawyer just arguing that it isn't violent.  Your honor on a packed subway.  It may not be appropriate, but this Mack guy had a good lawyers because they fought the  case all the way to the top. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Mack ended up facing a max of three months for a misdemeanor sex abuse charge.  Three months.  Wow.  How do you come just from rubbing on a fucking drain like that?  Jesus.  Wow.  I'm surprised.  Called frottage.  Frottage.  That seems...  You weren't a dry humper?  It's pretty easy.  Back in the day?  Not to orgasm, no.  I've covered my pants a couple times. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, I have.  I have no problem admitting that.  We do strip clubs, though.  You get a nice dry humping going.  Oh, no.  I need ass cheeks on the dick going...  With a rhythmic rubbing.  Come on, Sam.  Help him out.  You want to just do it just for the show?  For the show.  For the show.  I don't want to rub you.  Why is that one little thing of hair sticking down there?  I don't know.  It just come off.  Just cut that nonsense.  Tuck it off.  You just tuck it in the top.  There you go.  Tuck it away.  So I guess that's it for this case. 
[00:38:30]  That's just amazing.  We learned something today.  You can pretty much grind up against a girl on a subway in New York City as long as your  penis is not out.  You can spill jizz in your pants and you're not going to go to jail most likely.  Have fun.  That's pretty fucked up.  Have fun out there, boys.  Something doesn't seem right about that one, obviously.  Even if there's been too...  Girls never fucking just spread and go on your leg and start humping away.  That'd be amazing, wouldn't it?  Wouldn't that just be amazing around the subway and some girl starts doing that?  You'd fucking take her out to dinner. 
[00:39:00]  It wouldn't even be an issue.  You'd be like, oh, this pervert tried to...  Therein lies the difference, ladies, in everything in life.  That is everything that is different about men and women.  You could put right there in that moment on a subway.  If a guy is humping your leg and if a girl is humping a guy's leg, spells out the whole  relationship.  Same shit with teachers and shit.  Yeah.  You know.  Most guys don't mind if the female teacher is having sex with them. 
[00:39:30]  Well, they always yap about it.  Yeah, that's the mistake they make.  They start yapping at their friends about it.  And then the one nerd has to tell everyone.  A nerd.  Yeah.  One tattletale.  Mm-hmm.  Tattlin'.  Yeah, tell them tall tales.  Out of school.  Snitch.  Who's telling tales out of school?  Yeah, you're supposed to keep secrets.  They're healthy.  You don't go snitching.  Oh.  Oh, he put his knees on the side of my head on the mat while I was napping. 
[00:40:00]  Shame is supposed to be buried.  Yeah, he put strudel in my eye while I was napping.  He gave me milk nickels for milk money.  He put his knee on my ear.  It hurted.  It's unsweetened strudel, I see.  I had to make its vitamins.  Vitamins. 
[00:40:30]  We have the Mitt Romney audio.  Mitt.  Huh?  The justification or the actual...  There's two clips now.  There's the one where he was secretly recorded saying what they say are bad things about some of these...  I don't have either clip in front of me.  These bums.  I call them bums.  Isn't this some...  This is a big story.  Where's the audio clips?  I don't have them in front of me.  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Wait, where's the clips?  You got the clips.  Everyone's talking about this, and I don't have it in front of me.  Yeah.  Adok?  Where's the clip?  B-Rock, did you fail us?  No.  Where are the clips?  I'm working on...  Where the clips?  Where the clips?  I'm finding them right now.  But should I have them in front of me?  Theoretically.  Theoretically, shouldn't they be front and center?  Yeah, I would...  Yeah.  It's a big story today.  It's a strong argument you could make.  People are saying this is going to really fuck up Mitt Romney's campaign.  What do you have to say? 
[00:41:30]  I don't have the clips.  Where are the clips?  Are they in front of you, or...  They're not in front of me.  You mean the secretly taped Mitt Romney conversation?  I don't have it in front of me.  I'd probably think that would be a good one to have.  That would be a biggie?  No.  Did you check in front of you?  I looked in front of me.  I don't see it.  Oh, man.  Let me see what I got in front of me.  Mm-hmm.  Kid pretends to be a disenfranchised Obama supporter.  Tricking Fox News.  I got that.  That's a fun one.  Yeah, I heard that.  It's, like, kind of just goofy.  Was he tricking Fox News, or is he just a goofball guy? 
[00:42:00]  I don't know.  I heard some of that.  I need the Romney clip.  Where is it?  You still don't have it?  There's no Romney clip.  No.  Holy fuck.  I have four different copies of him justifying the clip.  Yeah?  Where's the clip?  It was everywhere yesterday.  Go to BuzzFeed.  BuzzFeed.  Wow.  He said...  I know BuzzFeed has it.  He said there are 47% who are dependent upon the government, who believe they're victims.  What he said is not terrible.  I mean, it's stupid if you're campaigning, but...  Yeah.  It's not the smartest thing when you're campaigning and you've got swing states, but I appreciate... 
[00:42:30]  Well, I was going to say I appreciate his honesty, but the problem is he wouldn't say  that if he knew the mics were on.  Right.  I hate all of them.  I swear.  I don't lean either way with these guys.  I just love to hear it.  Yeah.  Well, I don't have it in front of me.  Where's the clip?  I got the clip.  The good thing is no one thinks they're the people he was talking about.  You never think you're the part of what he's talking about.  Like, oh, he's talking about those people.  So you're like, I'll still vote for him.  I agree. 
[00:43:00]  It certainly is one of the problems in this country that a lot of people don't pay taxes.  Yeah.  But when you're campaigning, that probably will hurt you.  Because most people don't want to pay taxes.  Hells no.  I would so not pay taxes if I could.  Oh, my God.  It would be awesome.  And he also said something about Mexicans.  I don't have the clip.  Oh, boy.  We have the clip?  I got the clip.  Five minutes too late.  Ah.  It's all about timing.  Fuck.  You want to play the clip?  I got it if you want it.  Play that goddamn clip.  Let's hear it. 
[00:43:30]  There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.  All right.  There are 47% who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims,  who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are  entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.  But that's an entitlement.  And the government should give it to them.  And they will vote for this president no matter what.  And I mean, the president starts off with 48, 49, 43.  He starts off with a huge number. 
[00:44:00]  These are people who pay no income tax.  47% of Americans pay no income tax.  So our message of low taxes doesn't connect.  And you'll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich.  I mean, that's what they sell every four years.  And so my job is not to worry about those people.  I'll never think they say that they should take personal responsibility and care for their  lives.  What I have to do is convince the 5% to 10% in the Senate that are independent, that  are thoughtful, that look at voting one way or the other dependent upon, in some cases, 
[00:44:30]  this emotion, whether they like the guy or not.  Okay, can I start?  He's totally right.  But can I start by saying this?  I like that version of the guy.  Yeah.  What happens to him when the fucking cameras go on?  You go into campaign mode.  But what happens?  That's a completely different guy.  That's a guy.  I'm not saying I like.  Well, I think he's being honest.  Yeah, he's right.  And he is right with what he's saying.  But the confidence of how he says it.  Yeah.  What happens when he goes on TV?  I guess he's acting on TV and trying to play this character that he thinks will get votes. 
[00:45:00]  He's trying to hide that guy.  He's trying to hide that guy.  Holy, that's a different guy.  He's hiding that guy.  But that's not heartless.  What he's saying is that people that Obama's going to get don't care about lower taxes because  47% aren't paying him.  Right.  That's the truth.  Yeah.  You don't have to make a judgment on whether he's right or wrong.  He's totally being honest there.  Right.  And I think it's very accurate what he said.  But he didn't know the mic was on, obviously.  What was he talking? 
[00:45:30]  Because he was talking to people.  He wasn't just talking to them in an elevator.  Where was he?  At a dinner or something?  Somebody was a fucking telltale.  They're right.  I like that.  That actually makes me like him more.  Yeah, that's the truth.  Wow.  What else is he?  He needs those undecided voters.  That's the full clip.  What?  That's the full clip.  There's supposed to be he said something about Mexicans.  What I find fascinating is he's not stammering through that or anything.  You know?  Yeah.  He's in the moment.  He knows exactly what he wants to say.  He makes his point very clear. 
[00:46:00]  Wow.  We haven't heard that guy on TV once.  Hmm.  I want to know where he goes, and had my dad been born Mexican, and had my dad been born  of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this, but he was unfortunately born  to Americans living in Mexico.  I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino.  Again, that's going to sound terrible, but he's telling the truth.  Right.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah, I like that clip.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was very interesting. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, he was talking to wealthy GOP donors.  Right.  Well, that's how he feels.  Yeah.  But that point of view would be a rough one to get votes.  That's why these guys are all just bullshitting all of us.  They're telling us what they think we want to hear.  Well, campaigning is an art form.  You've got to get out there and say what is going to affect the polls.  I get it.  It's unfortunate, though.  Yeah.  Honesty has no place in a campaign. 
[00:47:00]  But we all just accept it, right?  Yeah.  Yes, we do.  Huh.  Oh, he was in a house.  Who's the douchebag that taped him?  Don't know.  It was a Mexican thing.  Although I don't blame them.  I mean, if you have the presidential candidate talking, I would probably tape it, too, if I could.  Yeah.  But I wish he would say that publicly and just stop trying to be Mr. Nice Guy.  Be the guy you are.  Oh, you were born with a silver spoon.  You know, you never had to earn anything and so forth.  And frankly, I was born with a silver spoon. 
[00:47:30]  My heritage, my dad, you probably know, was the governor of Michigan and was the head of a car company.  But he was born in Mexico.  And had he been born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this.  But he was not.  I was born in one of Americans living in Mexico.  He lived there for a number of years.  And, I mean, I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino.  That's not bad. 
[00:48:00]  He's just joking around.  This is nothing.  They're going to try to spin it.  God almighty.  You can't joke around at a dinner?  That's the guy the wife tries to explain.  He's a funny guy and people really, really like him and all that.  Oh, boy.  And it just doesn't come across when he's front of the TV lights.  And now, of course, MSNBC, you get people like Al Sharpton demanding an apology.  No, he didn't yet.  Oh, okay.  I guarantee you.  Really, you think?  That on his show, he will say that Romney should apologize. 
[00:48:30]  His whole show has turned into a Romney needs to apologize program.  I'm outraged.  That's all he does.  He fucking hijacked that whole channel.  Ugh, MSNBC.  They're terrible.  They're trying to get black viewers because they're dying with white.  They're just dying.  They have nothing.  He hijacked it, though.  Gets his nose in every single fucking show.  He's terrible.  I don't like him at all.  He's a race-baiting shithead.  I don't like him at all.  Yes.  But there you go.  Romney being way more personable. 
[00:49:00]  And Romney.  Those clips were not bad at all, man.  They weren't bad at all.  Yep.  Boy.  I don't think he said anything angrily.  He was telling the absolute truth.  Obama's base doesn't care.  That's a great point.  They don't care if I talk about lower taxes.  Obama hammers on taxes for the rich.  And, of course, that's going to get people.  He's right.  He's totally right.  I saw Jesse the Body on Piers Morgan last night.  Oh, should we play that audio today?  What a fucking lunatic. 
[00:49:30]  We should be playing some of those clips today.  Do you want to play them?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I might as well grab a few.  Sam, I don't have the clip.  Oh, shit.  Why don't we have that audio in front of us?  He was...  He just now looks...  Shouldn't someone...  We need someone to go through that audio for real.  He looks like a complete lunatic now, too.  He always has, but he's just...  He's shaking like crazy now.  He shakes a lot.  I saw him walking out of Howard's studio yesterday when I went to the bathroom.  Yeah?  Did you punch him in the face?  No, you know.  I don't even know if he's on me.  But he's always rocked. 
[00:50:00]  And he's been doing that since we had him on K-Rock.  I think he has.  And it's totally a guess.  If it's not Parkinson's, it's something.  Because it might be a nervous thing.  Or it might just be...  He rocks more than shakes.  He rocks a lot, which, you know, again, my first thought was autism.  His head's going.  But yeah, he is shaking a lot.  So he may have something going on.  Because I've noticed that since K-Rock...  It's gotten worse, you think?  I don't know.  Yeah.  But I've noticed that he's much jumpier.  Oh, oh.  Can we go back, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  Sure.  Because this is live.  I want to see how MSNBC handles the audio we just played. 
[00:50:30]  They're playing it right now.  And of course, they'll comment right afterwards.  You'll be out there talking about tax cuts for the rich.  That's what they sell every four years.  And so my job is not to worry about those people.  I'll never think they said that they should take first responsibility and care for their  lives.  What I have to do is convince the 5 to 10 percent in the Senate that are independent, that are  thoughtful, that look at voting one way or the other, depending upon, in some cases,  emotion, whether they like the guy or not. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  So they had a news conference and doubled down on it and asked for more.  We will show that in a moment.  But first, Jeff.  There's a serious argument we made in this country about the rise of the entitlement state,  whether we can afford Medicare as it is, whether it's sustainable as an entitlement, and whether  dependency is a serious issue.  But it's hard to imagine a candidate for president bolloxing that message up on so many different  fronts as the way Mitt Romney did. 
[00:51:30]  Okay.  First of all, on the factual issue, the idea that people who don't pay income tax are necessarily  Democrats.  No.  Many of them are senior citizens, and they're voting for Mitt Romney.  Many of them are people who have many of them pay other taxes.  Yes.  And to do it in a closed meeting with rich supporters, Barack Obama is still paying the  political price for that closed-door meeting four years ago when he talked about white  working-class folks clinging to their guns and religion. 
[00:52:00]  And it's true.  I, on this very program, referenced Mitt Romney as Thurston Howell III, which is now the David  Brooks column, that's exactly, you cannot imagine a more destructive message at this point.  So, Eugene Robinson, can you take this a step further?  The reason why I'm worried this will last is because it does fit into an overall, I hate  to use the word, narrative that just won't go away. 
[00:52:30]  The black guy's going to look out.  It actually fits into several overlapping narratives about Mitt Romney, none of them  flattering, frankly.  Racist, racist, racist.  All the pejoratives about Romney.  You know, for me, the part of that...  I'll tell you where he did, when I listened to that again, is when he says, I'm never going  to convince them what I need to worry, what that sounds like, and that was a dumb thing.  There's got to be a better way to phrase that, because it's almost like he really is saying,  I'm going to give a fuck about pleasing half the country. 
[00:53:00]  You know what I think he really meant, though?  Not, when I'm president, I'm going to just fucking throw these people to the side.  He was saying, to win this election, he can't convince these people to vote for him, no  matter what he does.  It's not, once I get in, I'm going to just concentrate on these people, and these people  go fuck themselves.  He was talking about the election, not the presidency.  He's trying to figure out how to get those people to vote for him.  And that's completely...  And he's starting to realize that's going to be really tough. 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  Here's what the smarter message would have been.  A smarter message would have been, what I have to do is convince that 5 or 10% that's  typically in the middle, and the other 47%, I have to convince that I'm going to help  them get back to work.  Right.  I'm going to help them get back on their feet.  I'm going to...  That would have been a smarter way to do that, even in that situation, because you have to know  you can always be taped.  The smarter message would have been to have that discussion in the middle of a desert after everyone  was packed out.  After everybody's naked in the water in a pool. 
[00:54:00]  That would be the smarter way to do it.  He didn't realize he was being taped.  You've got to remember that.  Yes.  So Stunt Brain wants in badly.  Okay.  Wants to talk about Romney.  Stunt Brain.  Good morning, fellas.  Hello.  Good morning, you right-wing freak.  Yes.  I happen to be much like you, Opie.  I do stand as a registered independent.  I just tend to vote on a more conservative angle.  All right.  Fair enough.  What do you got there, Mikey?  Well, this tape's been out for a while. 
[00:54:30]  That's the weird thing.  And why did it pop now?  It was recorded last May.  And we've got the background on it.  Oh, wow.  On the blaze.  This came from the fundraiser at the Boca Raton home of a private equity manager named  Mark Lader.  And Mother Jones Magazine got a hold of it.  And they've been kind of sitting on it.  Well, they'll probably want to use it to damage him now a month out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're probably waiting for full effect.  Yeah.  This is a key moment.  And especially in the aftermath of the embassy mess and what's going on there. 
[00:55:00]  Because there's a huge story breaking out of this that Obama bundled, bungled the embassy  mess, and now he's talking, or State Department is talking about releasing the blind shake  in hopes of calming down all this.  What?  Wow.  They can't release that fucking piece of garbage.  Who's even mentioning that?  We got a confidential source from the State Department contacted us yesterday to tell us that 
[00:55:30]  the negotiations were underway, and we're trying to get an on-the-record statement from  someone on the Foreign Relations Committee.  It should be coming out today with confirmation.  If they fucking even are considering that, what a fucking travesty.  Well, that would certainly...  There's no way.  You don't know.  My humble opinion.  This country would be outraged.  Holy fuck.  Right before election?  Would they?  When we contacted State...  Fucking country.  People. 
[00:56:00]  State did not deny it when we contacted them yesterday.  They referred us to justice.  And when we talked to justice, they said, no, we're not releasing him.  But they didn't deny that a transfer of custody for humanitarian reasons could happen.  Fuck him!  What humanitarian reasons?  God!  God!  His health?  Gives a shit.  You're like, what, McRae's health?  Was that his name?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck his health.  Fuck that blind bastard. 
[00:56:30]  He should have been shanked years ago.  Well, he is serving a life sentence, but there is further discussion going on.  And we're really delving into this today, because if this happens, one of the sources said the release would be, or the transfer of custody could happen after the election, but the violence could be tamped down now.  Now, the Egyptian president, Morsi, said that this was one of his primary goals was to get the blind sheik released. 
[00:57:00]  Ugh.  Ugh.  We're just such a soft country.  That really bugs me.  So when that's all in the background, churning away, and Mother Jones releases this tape, it takes all the focus off of what's going on in the Middle East.  Right.  Yeah.  But Romney was dumb, because he should have phrased that differently.  You have to know that you can be taped at any time, and it's just not the smart way to say it when you're trying to fight for 5% or 10% of the people.  It's just not a smart way to phrase it. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, and that 5% or 10% really comes down to, like, 2 million or 1 million voters.  And those guys are really going to get a lot of attention.  And right now, they're getting attention based on this issue.  And how many of those 1 to 2 million are in the 47% that pay no federal income tax?  Right.  It's a big question.  Yeah, wow.  Romney sounded very different in that clip, didn't he, Mikey?  Yeah, it's anâ€”he's not worried, like you said.  He's able to speak his mind, he can speak freely, and he's off the cuff. 
[00:58:00]  He actually is pretty engaging in those moments.  He really was.  And you wonder if he's just concerned when he's in public about saying something foolish and that he holds back.  He wants to hide that guy.  He doesn't want to look like a rich white guy, but he is a rich white guy.  Right.  But he's tryingâ€”he doesn't want to sound like that because he knows that, you know, it can be eternal.  So he's a bad actor.  He's just acting in front of the American people when he's on TV.  Well, he was an effective CEO.  He's a guy that can make decisions.  Well, you heard that in that clip.  I could tell that guy does very well with companies. 
[00:58:30]  Now, I wonder if this will drive out the clip that we heard about during the 2008 election of Obama in a similar situation speaking to donors.  We've never seen this tape.  We've only heard it has very damaging statements.  Wait, that tape's never seen the light of day?  Never.  And I think the L.A. Times owns it, and they won't release it.  Will they release the transcript?  No.  Why not?  So it's just a rumor that he said all this shit?  Right now it's a rumor, and we don't know anything. 
[00:59:00]  I mean, technically, because it sounds like it's notâ€”it actually happened.  What's the L.A. Times commentary on whether they have it or not?  Yeah.  They're denying that they'veâ€”I think they've said they don't have to release it.  But there's questions whether it's there and how bizarre the comments are.  But it's just amazing to me that this happens, and yet everyone seems to forget about the discussion of that tape with President Obama.  So until it comes forward, we can't say anything that's on it. 
[00:59:30]  But I think we need to watch what's happening about the State Department issue, the blind shake, and how we're handling the Middle East.  Because to me, that's very important, and much more important than comments to a few donors.  Exactly.  Right.  Well, I mean, some people would think that when you're commenting privately, if you're overheard, that's the real you.  That's why when I hated Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton so much, when Jackson was on O'Reilly, and he mumbled into the microphoneâ€”and even Fox buried thisâ€”that Obama, he's talking down to niggas. 
[01:00:00]  I'm going to rip his balls off. And thatâ€”and Sharpton goes, well, that's not the Reverend Jesse I know.  If he says it privately and is overheard, that's the real guy.  Of course it is.  So it's got to work both ways.  Yep.  And it does. And the DNCâ€”the RNC chairman, Reince Priebus, has supported Romney on this.  And he's saying, you know, he wasn't speaking anything that wasn't true.  You know, there's 46.7 percent of the population pays no taxes. 
[01:00:30]  And those people are predisposed to supporting President Obama.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But the way he was saying they're not going to listen to the message about taking control of their own lives, that's just a dumb way to say it.  Like, I'm not saying he's wrong or I disagree with him, but you've got to say that smarter.  You can give the same message, but again, if you're campaigning and it's this close, you have to say shit like that smarter when you know you can be taped.  You're right. You don't tell people, well, you're just voting for the guy because you're dependent on government and, you know, you want to keep your check coming each month. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, but Mike makes a good point. This was taped a while ago.  You're in May.  Yeah.  This was in May, and bits and pieces have been on the Internet for months.  Mother Jones just chose this point in time to make a big splash with it.  Of course. Mother Jones.  And he said there's more to come. So this is only the first shoe to drop.  Hey, Stunty, what are you talking about the Obama thing? Because apparently that clinging to guns and religion clip is out there.  No, this is a different one, I think.  Okay. What is it? What is he supposed to have said on that one? 
[01:01:30]  All they have told us is it's so damaging that if it got out, he would not have been elected.  Oh, well.  Well, that's easy to say until we hear the clip.  But it's good speculation.  Now we need to hear the clip. Yeah, of course. It's a good story.  All right, Mike. Stuntbrain there. Theblaze.com, right?  Yes. And Opa, I'm using your clip of Zuccotti then and now in my historical piece on the one-year anniversary.  So you can get a little on the Opie radio videos. 
[01:02:00]  Oh!  What is that, when I went there when it was empty?  Yeah, you did a great little then and now right after it was empty.  Right on, brother.  So it's part of my retrospective after yesterday's lackluster protest.  Yeah.  They only had a few hundred people down there, right?  There were more cops than people.  Oh, really? Did you go down?  Oh, yeah. I was in the middle of it.  I felt like I should have went yesterday. I didn't, though. 
[01:02:30]  It was, you didn't miss much.  I just loved it down there. It was just so much fun, wasn't it, Mike?  Mike was down there every day, too, for a while.  Yeah, I was, and we're never going to see that again, but it's over. It's done.  We'll never see that again. You're right.  Why don't you think cops are people?  Oh.  Somebody misspoke.  Yeah, exactly.  More cops there than people.  Head of the blaze resigns in disgrace.  Oh, again.  Calls cops non-people.  Well, the occupiers were calling the police animals. 
[01:03:00]  Of course.  Cops on horseback, they were saying,  Look at those animals on top of the horses.  Ah, I get it.  Seekers.  Wow.  They should go to a country where they crack their fucking skulls open.  They go to Syria.  They know how to handle a protest.  Yeah.  They sure do.  The cops are saying please and thank you here.  Oh, my God.  All right, Mike.  Theblaze.com.  Always a pleasure, sir.  Thank you, fellas.  We're going to go eat now, and then we're going to do Jesse Ventura.  Where's the clip?  Do I got the clip yet?  I got clips.  A clip of Jesse. 
[01:03:30]  That isn't in front of the live audience that he had last night.  The clips I have are in front of the live audience.  Oh, wow.  I have Ventura on the Navy SEAL book.  Uh-huh.  We broke that story wide open.  Oh, okay.  Good.  See, we got some exclusives here on the ONA show.  Politics being based on bribery.  Uh-huh.  I remember hearing that one.  It's all bribery.  You know what?  He's not wrong.  He's not wrong.  Yeah.  If we do it, it's a felony, but they do it. 
[01:04:00]  Shaken motherfucker.  Let's remember, I gave him pirate face.  I like my Jesse Ventura, shaken, not stirred.  Ventura's take on 9-11, which would be interesting.  We haven't heard that before.  Oh, well.  Never heard that one before.  I don't know which way he'll...  You think he's going to back pal?  I'm just asking questions.  Does he say thermite paint?  That's what you got to stick around for.  Love the thermite.  And Jesse Ventura on Mitt Romney.  So we got a few clips.  We got the clips, finally.  But I can't confirm.  The SEAL book could be from the SEAL we had in studio, or it could be... 
[01:04:30]  It's about SeaWorld.  They play the little tootie horns with their nose.  It could be about the new book.  It is about the new book.  He says something to the effect that the American people have the right to know.  Right.  Which I kind of agree with, because they're not...  The SEAL book does not...  I'm reading it.  They are not giving...  He made extra sure he's not giving away anything classified.  No technology that would endanger troops.  Right.  Okay.  We got lots to do, but we're going to eat first.  Yeah.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Channel. 
[01:05:00]  On Sirius XM.  Show me penis!  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  We used to rape Will Fouts just to make him break character, because he would never...  He dressed up as a character for like two straight weeks.  It was so annoying.  It was so annoying.  He's like, Will.  He's like, I'm not Will.  I'm Ron Burgundy.  Let's go.  All right.  Well, Ron, can we talk? 
[01:05:30]  He's like, I'm busy this week with art.  And so this went on for weeks and weeks.  And Tracy, you can never pronounce his name right.  He called him Pharrell.  Will Pharrell.  Hey, Will Pharrell.  He'd be like, let's play characters and break Will Pharrell.  Let's rape him.  Me, Colin Quinn, and Tracy repeatedly raped, like fake raped him for hours.  We'd leave him in a dumpster, take his clothes off.  And he would never break character.  It was so obnoxious.  Will would be, Tracy would be in the doorway as we're fake rape, as we're literally pulling 
[01:06:00]  his pants down.  Tracy would be in the doorway with an unlit cigarette going, hurry up and save me some  of that.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U.  Live.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you.  Yeah, this F.U.  goes out to that fucking whore that I used to bone with her 38 double D's to ruin my life.  Fuck you and your gigantic, natural, tremendous tits, you fucking psycho whore.

Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Is it just me or does Gina Blackwood sound like Crusty the Clown?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  To my ex-wife, fuck you.

This fuck you goes out to everyone who says they can't stop singing Mimi Beardsley.  Shut up.  Go fuck yourself.  We get it.  It's a song.  It's catchy.  It's fucking awesome.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  This F.U. goes out to the woman in line in front of me at Walmart last night.  You didn't fit your pants and you smelled like you shit yourself.  Had to smell that until you left and it still lingered. 
[01:08:00]  F.U.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  The O.P. and Anthony Channel.  Serious cancer.  We don't do E-Rock's bit anymore.  I guess he decided to drop it.  Well, certainly you're not talking about weight. 
[01:08:30]  No, he means the thing that helps them control his harness.  That's it.  You want to know what happened on this date?  What the hell of it?  For shits and giggles.  Patty Hearst was found.  I don't know.  That's not on my list today.  Yeah, I saw it on the news.  Britney Spears and Kevin Federline were married eight years ago.  Remember them?  Mm-hmm.  The Post and Brokaw received their anthrax letters on this date 11 years ago. 
[01:09:00]  11 years ago?  How's that possible?  I'm still waiting for permission to open it.  His anthrax letters.  Yeah, remember what that did to all the mail that we used to get?  Everything was opened.  Oh, my God.  Then everything was opened when you got it.  I know.  Everyone took our drugs.  Yeah, what the fuck?  That our listeners would mail to...  What?  Huh?  What?  I don't remember that.  Who said that?  I don't remember that.  Dude, I was so scared.  I was living with Florentine, and I didn't open my mail for a month. 
[01:09:30]  I was terrified.  You were?  Yeah, about anthrax.  Why were they telling you?  Chip and Jim Norton.  No, because I was afraid it was going through a similar post office.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  So what did you do with that mail for a month?  I mean, I eventually opened it, but it was piling up outside my bedroom door.  See, this is why we do anniversaries.  See, it gives a little material for you.  It sparks a thought.  It sparks a thought.  I didn't know Jim Norton didn't open his mail for a month.  That's kind of strange to me.  Did he eventually open that mail?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:10:00]  It was all like phone bills and stuff like that, and things of that nature.  Oh, things Opie doesn't pay.  Yeah, that's true.  If you pay your bill.  Pay your bill.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'd smack that bitch, and I don't smack broads.  I really don't.  I smack a bitch.  I don't smack broads, but I would smack that bitch for saying that.  I pay my bills.  I pays my bill.  Member of KISS.  The members there of KISS appeared on MTV without what?  Without what?  Without their hats.  They always wore cat diesel fuel hats.  Without their hats.  29 years ago.  Very good, Jimmy. 
[01:10:30]  That was 30 years ago, man.  29.  Wait.  Let's slow down a little bit.  J.J. Johnston, I think, is who they talked to.  J.J. Jackson?  J.J. Jackson.  I'm sorry.  I always fucked it up.  Yeah, J.J. Jackson.  The late J.J. Jackson.  Yeah, they did.  The only VJ, former original VJ, to be what they called dead.  It was a Gene, Paul, Peter, and I want to say Vinnie Vincent, or was it?  Oh, yeah.  They didn't have all the original members for that.  No.  Who were the four? 
[01:11:00]  But it was the big thing was just seeing Gene and Paul without their dumb makeup on.  I'll tell you, they pulled that off for fucking years pretty successfully, man.  I'll hear it.  A decade.  Ten years together, exclusively here on MTV this evening.  They were only together ten years at this point.  What?  You hear that?  Yeah.  After ten years.  Holy shit.  That's fucked up right there.  But nobody, there was pictures of them like-  It was only ten years old.  With bandanas, because no one had cell phone cameras. 
[01:11:30]  There was no way to-  Yes.  There was a decade they kept their faces in.  I remember being an old boy, and I think it was Circus Magazine.  We brought this up a lot.  Remember the shot where they kind of showed him in the mirror?  But you could see him without makeup, but it was like just a little bit.  Oh, man.  Just a tease.  Maybe I'm dreaming this.  I don't remember.  I just don't remember it.  I remember something like this.  Or it might have been the big reveal, and it was in Circus Magazine.  And someone caught him.  Like, you know, their head was-  The back of the head was to the camera.  Right.  But with the mirror thing, you could kind of see what's going on. 
[01:12:00]  I could see.  And it was a huge exclusive, even though obviously the band set the whole fucking thing up to get us buying the dumb magazine.  In hindsight, when you look back, you can see that there were pictures of them, but you never knew if it was them or not.  You never knew if it was them.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, let's go to J.J. Jackson.  MTV 1983.  Kiss without their makeup for the very first time.  Vinnie Vincent, lead guitarist and co-writer of many of the songs on the current Kiss album.  And then it fades into him.  It's a picture of their makeup on a car. 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  It was a car.  And Kiss is, by the way, the very first band that Eric has ever been with.  Oh, jeez.  And they were showing the-  It's a picture of their makeup, and it fades into their face.  Paul Stanley, lead guitarist and lead vocalist, Paul is a co-founder of the group.  This is so weird.  That was a big moment.  Pretty smart, though.  Gene Simmons, also co-founder of Kiss.  He is the fire-breathing, blood-spitting monster of Kiss.  So many people watched this.  Welcome, you guys.  This is amazing.  Whoa.  It just looks like a douche. 
[01:13:00]  Wow.  Oh, God.  I think it's my old clip, but that was the big reveal.  Look at all their hair.  But that was to kind of pump up their record sales.  After 10 years.  Fast forward 29 more years.  So next year will be their 40th anniversary?  Yeah, 73.  What the hell happened?  So they'll do something for their 40th anniversary.  40 years with Kiss.  My God, man.  So that happened.  Boston released More Than a Feeling 36 years ago.  You're not a Boston fan, are you? 
[01:13:30]  I liked Boston.  I love Boston.  There you go.  I fucking love Boston.  Jimmy, you liked Boston growing up?  I like a couple of their songs, and I used to charge Kenny Penko a dollar to draw this  cover for him, and I was never that good.  Look at you.  We all used to try to draw the album covers.  Remember that shit?  Yeah.  I sucked at it.  Or trace them?  Trace them.  That's what I did.  I traced.  I loved a good piece of tracing paper.  Tracing paper rule.  But then you'd put dents in the album. 
[01:14:00]  You'd leave little divots in the album where you'd trace it, and you're like, I'm a cunt.  I ruined it.  All that paper's so fucking thin, you'd always poke a hole in it as you're tracing.  Trace through it.  Tracing paper.  I loved tracing paper.  More Than a Feeling, Kurt Cobain liked this song.  He liked Boston.  Yeah.  And there's some kind of connection with this song, is it, and Smells Like Teen Spirit?  Anyone?  Yeah.  Is it online there, Sam?  I think we did this a little while ago, but I mean, with the song being released 36 years  ago, we could play it again.  Well.  Smells Like Teen Spirit! 
[01:14:30]  Some would say that it completely ripped off more than a feeling.  Really?  Yeah.  Is this it?  How about you turn down yours, E-Rock?  Yeah, I'm punk.  There we go.  It did all seem to change with that song.  Which song do you mean?  Smells Like Teen Spirit.  Oh, that song, isn't it?  Hmm.  Yeah, how about that?  More Than a Feeling with the lyrics changed.  More Than a Feeling 
[01:15:00]  When I Hear That Oh Yeah  Well, now.  Yeah?  Oh, they're being dubbed in.  They're goofing.  Oh, they're just goofing around with it. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, but this has been said a lot.  Yeah, but it's so...  Is this...  I don't really...  I don't know what I just heard.  I'm mad now.  I heard Nirvana goofing around.  I hate when we let down the listeners.  I don't know what happened there.  That was Nirvana goofing around before they were going to play Smells Like Teen Spirit and  singing More Than a Feeling.  Wow.  I thought they were dubbing the two songs together.  No, no.  So what the fuck?  They also played Do You Love Me by Kiss once goofing around.  I think mocking the song.  But some have said that More Than a Feeling is a lot like Teen Spirit. 
[01:16:00]  Where's that clip?  By Courtney.  Where that clip?  I think this is the one that surfed around.  Like, I think they were acknowledging that people were saying that, so they played them  back to back like that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I mean, they thought it was funny.  I didn't hear anything in there.  Yeah, that was just kind of...  That was just noise to me.  Fucking around.  Wow, Jimi Hendrix died today.  You're kidding.  42 years ago.  He'd only be...  Where?  Yeah.  Our whole lives...  He's 69.  Our whole lives we've known him as dead. 
[01:16:30]  The fact is, we're older gentlemen.  This guy would only be 69.  Well, that's kind of old for Jimi Hendrix.  Yeah, but think about it, though.  He's a guy that absolutely could still be alive.  69.  He could have been.  Man.  He got his shit together.  Yeah.  Do, do, do, do.  That was in 69?  No, he would be 69.  What year did he die?  42 years ago.  So that would be, uh...  70.  70, 71.  How come I do have some recollections of things like the moon landing? 
[01:17:00]  Because you're old.  I know.  But I don't remember hearing Jimi Hendrix died.  Because Hendrix didn't matter to you yet, probably.  Right.  Well, the moon thing was like...  And I don't even remember hearing news about, like, Woodstock.  I didn't know shit about music.  I only knew what my sister was listening to, and she was more into pop music.  I remember hearing the Beatles broke up.  Yeah.  But you didn't discover your own music yet.  That's why.  No. 
[01:17:30]  I remember watching Apollo...  Apollo 7 in school.  Yeah.  And, like, uh...  No.  I forgot what grade I was in.  They rolled the TV in?  They rolled the TV in.  11th.  You watched it before you went to prom?  Yeah.  Did you?  Yeah.  Did your prom have a space theme?  How old are you?  Why won't you admit it?  What's going on?  Oh, shit.  You've been lying about your age, I think.  Oh, that's funny. 
[01:18:00]  Apollo 7.  So there's this day in history.  There you go.  I think there was somebody famous on Apollo 7.  Like, one of the astronauts that everybody kind of knows.  Yeah.  Who was on that?  Which one?  I'm trying to think.  Herb Shemp.  Oh, Herb.  Was it Herb Shemp?  He was a great astronaut.  Later went on to...  Was Lovell on 7?  I don't know.  Well, I don't know either, Anthony.  Buzz Armstrong.  Buzz Armstrong.  Major Tom Paul Williams. 
[01:18:30]  You guys are assholes.  I think it was Buzz Lightyear.  Buzz Lightyear was in there.  Yeah, that was Buzz Lightyear's.  All right, who was on there?  Fucking Ride.  Walter M. Shearer?  Shearer.  Shearer.  He was one of the original 7 Mercury astronauts.  Christian McCullough, which is odd.  No.  Don F. Eisel?  Eisel.  Sally Ride.  Oh, Sally Ride was on that one?  And...  No.  And R. Walter Cunningham.  Cunningham!  Hey! 
[01:19:00]  Put my thumb in your hiney while you're floating.  Me and you in the spacecraft.  Me and you in the limb.  These astronauts were a bust, Anthony.  They were a bust.  They were a bust.  We don't know any of them.  Well, Wally was a big one.  Ah, Wally wasn't that big.  He was...  Yeah, he was kind of a big one.  Does he have a t-shirt?  Uh, no.  So, how is he big?  He's no Neil Armstrong.  But, uh...  Yeah, okay.  Let's talk...  Buzz 7 had some good people on there.  We interrupted, uh, because that whole thing with the Mitt Romney, but you were talking 
[01:19:30]  about, uh, Jesse Ventura on Piers.  I wanted to see that last night.  I forgot about it.  Jesse.  Well, it was, uh, very difficult.  I was watching, uh, Hoarders also.  Nice.  And then I had to switch.  It was remarkable.  There was a giant, uh, big, fat, uh, black woman with such a natural-looking short head  of blonde hair.  Yes, I was making plenty of jokes at my house, uh, to myself.  And, uh, then there was, uh, one of the Hoarders guys had to sleep in the house. 
[01:20:00]  I don't know.  That's a new thing they're doing.  They have the people that clean up the houses.  You know, like, uh, like, uh, Matt.  Matt has to sleep in the house now?  Last week, he slept in one of the houses.  Oh, boy.  Is the fucking show Jumping the Shark?  I don't know what they're doing.  Oh, are they Jumping the Shark?  Look, I like Matt.  Matt's a fun, good guy, and I still like the show a lot.  Why is he sleeping in the house?  He doesn't have to sleep in the house.  I don't know.  But then, last night, another guy slept in another house where, I don't know how, there 
[01:20:30]  were bugs everywhere.  Giant spiders and cocky roaches and beetles.  Yuck.  Lizards.  There were lizards running around this guy.  I would never agree to that.  Why is, is, um, is Troy Kwan Jewish?  Oh, no.  He's not here?  Why is he?  What?  Was that Troy?  No.  Oh, I thought that was Troy for a second.  I just caught, I swear, I just caught a glimpse of him, and he had his head down.  It looked like Troy's face.  I saw him go into shade.  Why is anyone going into shade with a big Star David shirt on, anyway?  Oh.  And shouldn't they be off? 
[01:21:00]  Isn't today a Jew-y holiday?  I think it is.  I guess.  I mean, yesterday is the day.  You have to be a Jew-y Jew to have today off of today.  Yeah.  Yesterday is the day.  I called Bobby.  Everybody's off, though.  Of course Bob's off.  I'm taking the next two days off.  Oh, that's good.  I said we only have, I think, eight days left on our contract.  Is he really taking two days for the holiday?  Yeah.  They have to, those Jews.  What do you mean they have to?  No, they don't.  Those fucking negotiations are more important than the shit.  If you adhere to your religious beliefs, you can't conduct business.  That's why I tried to order a camera from the Jews at B&H, and on their website it says, 
[01:21:30]  we have this order will not go through until 8 p.m. on Tuesday.  Why isn't Bob conducting, I'm not Jewish, so I don't want my business interfered with  when it's this close to the Jews.  Because you're a Jew.  That is a tough one.  The Jews are always messing up your life.  That's a tough one.  Right?  The Jews?  I don't know.  The Jews have helped me a lot through my life.  He's messing up my life, and he's a Jew, so I can say that, Sam. 
[01:22:00]  Why don't you wait until like eight days are over before you?  I enjoy the Jews.  I know.  You like a good Jew?  I like the Jews.  Yeah.  They're great neighbors.  Mm-hmm.  The lawns are impeccable.  I have no issue with the Jews other than when I'm negotiating a deal, I don't want my radio  agent taking off.  That's my only ball of contention.  That's what you get for having a Jewish agent.  You got to deal with these fucking holidays that they seem to have all the time where they 
[01:22:30]  can't do things.  And why are they special?  Why do they get the days off and we don't?  Because they're the true religion.  Yeah, but they take our days.  They take our days.  Do they take the Catholic holidays?  I've been working long enough to know that the Jew also takes our fucking Christmas holidays  off.  Because they run everything.  In school, we would get Yom Kippur off.  Well, what about in the workplace?  That's racist.  Why do we have to work?  Because we're not a Jew.  The Yom's got nothing to do with it.  But the Jew gets to take our Christmas holiday off. 
[01:23:00]  I don't know why.  But they don't get Hanukkah off.  Do they don't?  Yeah, they do.  They do.  Jewish people?  Of course they do.  Hanukkah?  They don't get eight days off for Hanukkah.  Oh, not eight days.  That's what Hanukkah is.  But they get a couple off.  Yeah.  No, they don't.  They get the H and the N and the K.  Yep.  You tell them, Jimmy.  You tell them.  Incorrect.  Jesse Ventura on Piers Morgan.  Losing his mind?  Crazy?  Where are we at with this?  Yeah, you see, I think he was trying to just be sensible.  But of course, Piers was challenging him on certain things.  And Jesse, of course, was completely right. 
[01:23:30]  And Piers was wrong.  And Jesse would take that opportunity to tell him, you know, you don't know what you're  talking about.  Well, let's listen to the first clip.  Which is the first clip?  What is it about?  Ventura on the seal book.  Ooh, the new seal book.  My seal impression.  Not Chris Kyle's, right?  Yeah, the new one.  Yeah, I think the new one.  The killing of Osama.  That's right.  Oh, commercials.  Well, if I had the clip in front of me, we wouldn't have had a commercial.  Sam. 
[01:24:00]  What do you say Sam for?  I'm queuing it up.  Mr. Reynolds.  I'm the team.  Good afternoon, Mr. Ventura.  Hi.  My question to you is, as a former Navy seal, do you agree or disagree with the release and  release book by the six-member seal team and the objections of the Pentagon?  I don't have a problem with it.  The op was over over a year ago.  The op.  And I feel I have a right to know what went on because our entire military is paid by 
[01:24:30]  my tax dollars.  And I believe I have every right to know what they spend my tax dollars on.  Not really.  And I also would like to hear from boots on the ground.  Boots on the ground.  I don't want to hear from the media what happened in the op.  I don't want to hear from bureaucrats in Washington what happened on the op.  I would like to hear from boots on the ground, somebody that was actually there.  Those catchphrases.  How does it help, Jesse, if, I mean, my brother's a British Army colonel and has done tours of 
[01:25:00]  Afghanistan and Iraq and so on.  How does it help operationally if all the guys around are all wondering who's going to put this in a book?  I mean, surely they all sign up, don't they, to not write about their experiences.  Well, he's out now.  He's a civilian now.  And I just, you know, to me, he has the First Amendment rights or he should have them.  If he's not giving away anything that's listed under national security or that could affect anyone in the future operations, I say, why not? 
[01:25:30]  Like I said, I'd like to hear from boots on the ground what actually happened.  The right boots on the ground.  The right boots on the ground.  Fragmented story that comes out of Washington telling me what happened.  Indeed.  So I don't ever.  And besides you, the media and the SEALs themselves have allowed themselves to become like the Green Berets in the 60s and 70s.  Now, I don't like the fact that you even know we exist because back in the 60s and 70s, nobody even knew who we were.  Well, that's out of the bag. 
[01:26:00]  Now Hollywood's made plenty of films.  You've had my friend Dick Marsenko who created SEAL Team 6.  He's written a half a dozen books.  Of course, he's a friend of mine.  So if the creator of SEAL Team 6 can write books about what they do, what the heck?  If he doesn't put in jeopardy anyone, why is our government so up in arms about that he does this?  They didn't even know about us.  He would spout it off at every turn about how he was a Navy SEAL, so shut up. 
[01:26:30]  And doesn't that mean that there's probably some stuff we don't know about right now?  Yeah.  You would think.  You would think?  I think he's right, though.  I think he's right there.  Yeah.  I wouldn't have played that clip, Sam.  I think if I had the clips ahead of time, I wouldn't have played them.  Yeah.  It doesn't show Jesse Ventura being all wacky and shaky and shit.  He was a little shaky on that one.  A little?  Bill Burr has entered.  Billy!  What's up, Bill?  It was funny.  I just come walking in.  You guys are dead silent because you're listening to the creepy night.  And I just hear you just go, oh, shut up. 
[01:27:00]  I'm like, all right.  You'll be an Anthony show.  That's usually the show.  Here we are.  Here we go.  Shut up.  Four hours of love.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Jimmy?  Hi, Bill.  How are you, sir?  We're playing clips from Piers Morgan.  Jesse Ventura was on.  And I don't know.  Is it worth playing these clips, Sam?  That one was whatever.  I don't know.  Anybody make fun of his Ben Franklin haircut?  That is amazing, isn't it?  He's bringing it back.  He goes out like that.  It's about time we bring back the Ben Franklin.  When he was the governor, he shaved his head to try to look, you know, kind of... 
[01:27:30]  Clean cut.  Stately.  Now he's just figured, fuck it.  He's growing that...  It's like eight pieces of straw sticking out of the back of his head.  Really is the wild Bill Cody.  After he was scalped.  Want to try another clip?  Which would help to pre-screen these.  Well, yeah.  I can give you a title of the clip.  Our guys are really good at pre-screening clips. 
[01:28:00]  They really are good.  Who are?  The guys are.  Which guys?  Shut up.  How about politics is based on bribery?  That sounds controversial.  Bribery.  But you know what?  I would agree with him.  Yeah.  Oh.  Absolutely.  I would agree with him.  That sounds logical.  Yeah, he's being logical.  Well, let's play it.  Okay.  Is it long, though?  Like, that last clip was long.  What's his 9-11 clip?  I mean...  I want to hear that one.  Yeah.  Go straight to 9-11?  Yes.  Let's go to his 9-11 clip and see if he's still crazy. 
[01:28:30]  This one will make sense, too.  See if he's still a little crazy with this 9-11 clip.  Politics based on bribery, we agree with that.  And 9-11 being an inside job, we absolutely, obviously, on this show, do not agree with that.  Oh, yeah.  We do agree with that.  Yes, the government was behind it.  I forgot.  I didn't realize where you're going.  Yeah.  One.  So is one.  Oh, see?  Another commercial.  Another commercial because I don't have the clips in front of me, Sam.  You don't have nothing.  I blame you today.  Why?  Because I'm the guy in the room?  No.  The show kind of ran smoothly yesterday.  And you're back today, and things are a little miss. 
[01:29:00]  Sam Roberts.  Sounds like it's my fault.  The hopper.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Jesse, what would you have done on September the 12th, 2001?  What would you have done if you'd been president?  What would I have done?  I would have done a legitimate investigation to find out what exactly happened on 9-11.  How did they know who did this so quickly like they did Lee Harvey Oswald?  How quick they knew Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy. 
[01:29:30]  Because the people who did it were identified, and we knew who they were.  Then why couldn't we have stopped them beforehand if they were identified and we knew who they were?  It was a failure of intelligence.  Everyone's accepted that.  No, it wasn't.  We knew before with Condoleezza Rice's memo on August 6th when it stated right in the memo,  bin Laden to steal planes and run them into buildings.  And more stuff is coming out now also.  How much the Bush administration ignored the intelligence.  It was almost like they ignored it because they wanted it to happen. 
[01:30:00]  I ignore intelligence.  No, not.  It'll come off it.  Pause.  Wait a minute.  That's too many people applauding.  That's more of a hatred of Bush than an agreement of him.  Didn't he get mad at me when I said something about how he's blaming Bush?  He goes, don't put fucking words in my mouth.  Oh, he did curse.  He did curse at me.  And then here he is saying that Bush purposefully ignored intelligence.  So isn't that the same thing?  So he yelled at me for saying that to him.  How do we know for sure he ignored that intelligence? 
[01:30:30]  How do we know?  You don't.  He just has some questions.  Or was it more like he was trying to figure out, all right, what the fuck do I do with this intelligence?  It all comes together in hindsight.  You know, you could look at the intelligence and go, wow, that absolutely adds up to 9-11  and people flying planes into the building on September 11th.  Right, right.  But when they're all in pieces and you're getting dribs and drabs, as they say, it's a little  harder to put together before the fact.  They handled it terribly.  His shirt gives him 100% credibility in my work.  What is he wearing?  That Doug Henning shirt. 
[01:31:00]  He does have some kind of a sparkly, colorful.  He's going to old school.  Yeah.  He's the magician and the assistant all at the same time.  That shirt would look great under a blacklight, man.  That would light up nice.  I think it's a Hendrix shirt.  A Hendrix shirt?  What do you mean?  Really?  I think so.  With a Hendrix face?  Carefully picked out for this interview.  But then he has a blazer.  Of course.  I'm casual, but also take me a little serious.  Yeah, he's on the inside.  I haven't forgot my roots. 
[01:31:30]  Wait a minute.  Every war thought starts with a false flag operation.  You can't in all seriousness sit there and try and make out anybody in the pushing of  the state who wants it to happen.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask you something.  How much studying have you actually done of 9-11 other than what the government's told  you and what mainstream media's told you?  I've been studying it four years.  Pause right there.  Four years?  Four years.  So what were you doing for the first seven, Navy SEAL? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Were you busy until 2008?  I've been studying it for four years.  I've been studying it for four years.  The first seven.  I didn't know what to do.  I'm going to start looking into this.  Yeah, 2008.  What is it?  Fucking blithering idiot.  I understand he's working on something for the Civil War next.  What a fool.  Another false flag operation.  I'm actually just amazed that he can keep just arguing.  When you say shit like this, you're saying, hey, I want to argue for 45 minutes. 
[01:32:30]  Yes.  Every person.  Yes.  Yes.  And then you got to get to that point.  Well, I think this happened.  And I think that.  Then he immediately goes to, well, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're already starting to yell.  Just fucking go get yourself a...  The voice gets louder.  Just fucking relax.  Do you really want to do this?  You're right.  It's a commitment now.  He's doing this now.  And then the Bush administration is going to come out and just be, all right.  Yeah, he's got us.  Like Lance Armstrong.  You know, after a while, fuck it. 
[01:33:00]  I don't want to deal with this anymore.  Yeah, fuck it.  You're right.  You got us.  Well, that's what his supporters say.  He just didn't want to fight it anymore.  Right.  Who would give up all their titles like that?  Shut up.  Nobody.  Nobody.  Nobody.  Yeah, but then there's the other side, too, where it's like he passed.  They tested that guy.  He passed all of them.  Right.  How, like, 10 years later, can one guy be like, well, I saw him do it.  And then you're done.  And then you're like, all right.  Well, why would he not fight that?  Listen, Opie, everybody in the top fucking 20, everybody in, like, the top 20 is tested 
[01:33:30]  positive.  That's what they said.  Yeah, it's a level playing field.  They said everyone was doing it.  It's level.  Our roided up guy beat your roided up guy seven fucking times.  He won the race.  It's an old fact in that sport, everyone was doing shit.  Everybody.  You can't ride a bicycle 60 miles an hour up a mountain for a month straight.  You can't at that speed.  You see the old days?  They had those little bikes and they were smoking cigarettes.  It was like it was a jaunt through the country.  Really?  That's how the sports started?  Yeah.  They got these old school pictures, like, smoking cigarettes and stuff. 
[01:34:00]  And then some asshole decided to take it seriously.  It was supposed to be just a nice weekend of riding in the country.  Yeah, when you play pickup football and that dude who shows up with cleats.  That all leads to roids.  That's funny.  One guy wrecks it.  Yeah, let's go back to Jesse on 9-11.  Yeah, I have no problem with Lance.  He's a champion in my world.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  He'll always be a champion.  I've talked to people.  Wait a minute.  We've come in debt every day for five, six months.  Really?  So I know a lot about it.  One thing I do know is.  Let me ask you this then.  You cannot say that any member of the Bush administration knew it was going to happen 
[01:34:30]  or wanted it to happen.  It's a ridiculous thing to say.  Ridiculous.  Okay, let's talk about your BBC.  I have a tape of a BBC reporter broadcasting directly back to England.  Here he goes.  Talking about a third building has collapsed.  World Trade Center Building 7 talks for seven minutes.  All the while she's talking World Trade Center Building 7 is still standing right behind her.  Can you pause this for one second, Sam? 
[01:35:00]  So basically, he's putting it on the Bush administration that a person in the media did a bad job of reporting.  Which happens all the time.  All the time they fucking say the wrong things.  Not a day goes by where we point that out on this show.  What is he saying here, though?  He's saying that the lady from the BBC was part of this inner circle.  Right.  Right.  Of this thing.  Yeah.  And at that point, you know you can still keep the secret.  Right.  Some BBC broad.  What a surprise that a news person got something wrong.  They probably saw a building fall down. 
[01:35:30]  They don't know the area that well.  By the way, none of us actually knew what the building's names were at the time.  Now we do know it's Building 7 and all that.  And they probably said it looks like it's going to collapse.  Right.  And then she sees the one collapse and goes, oh, Building 7 has collapsed.  Duh.  Well, she gave the news report first.  What happens was they sent her the intel.  Right.  Like they were able to pull off hiding the people and hijacking the planes.  But they didn't realize you shouldn't give the intel before the building collapses.  Oh, I will say this.  I don't get how that third one just sort of tapped out without really taking any sort of 
[01:36:00]  direct hit.  I believe it was very, there was a massive fire burning in the basement and it just fucking  barbecued the guts out of it.  And everything got, I don't know about that.  And it was pretty damaged.  And everything shook pretty good too.  It was more of a, yeah, a structural issue than a physical, you know.  So a lot of papers caught on fire and that metal melted.  A lot of papers.  I think the third one fainted.  But why would they have to take out a third building? 
[01:36:30]  Listen, because if you knew what was in the building, you wouldn't say something as stupid  as that.  Why would they just move what's in the building then?  Just move it.  Just move it.  Just do it in the night.  No one's looking.  Yeah.  If you could do all this other shit.  If you could put explosives on every floor of the World Trade Center.  Just move it.  Move that info out of there.  Yeah.  Get it out of there.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, he is just the worst.  Didn't a big piece of the other building fall on it too?  Yeah.  Didn't the buildings collapse onto it? 
[01:37:00]  When all that shit is going down.  See, now that makes more sense to me than the papers caught on fire in the basement.  You know what it is, Anthony?  I think you and I, with our non-architectural degrees, should discuss this.  Structural integrity of buildings.  Of buildings for another 45 minutes.  Neat and, yeah, we could do that.  Oh, man.  Uneducated and just discussing it like we know what we're talking about.  But a building fell on it and then it fell down.  Right.  That's it.  There you go.  Like a child.  Yeah.  Explain it to them as if you were explaining it to a child.  Big building fall hits small buildings. 
[01:37:30]  Small building fall too.  Yes.  Small building.  I think it was the perfectness of how they fell.  The way they imploded.  That was the weird thing.  For you?  Yeah.  Do you have questions?  I don't, dude, I'm so beyond any of that crap.  I was in that window like three, four years ago and I just got tired of screaming over  like appetizers at people I didn't know and I was just like, you know, I don't give a  shit.  Let me ask you this, though.  How was it supposed to fall, you think?  How was it supposed to fall?  Yeah.  Do you feel like it? 
[01:38:00]  I don't know.  You'd think, yeah, you'd think that it would.  Like a big chunk would have kind of fell.  It would have come down, yeah, and something like that.  I mean, there's a reason why they detonate it the way they do so it doesn't, you know,  start, you know, fall like a fucking tree and land on other.  I don't know, dude.  Like I said, I don't have any sort of architectural background, obviously, but it just seemed  weird how they perfectly just went straight down.  Hey, I would say this, and I don't think they did.  I will say this.  I think if it was hit at the bottom.  I know you say that because you're a moron.  You're a, what are you talking about?  If they were hit at the bottom, if that kind of damage was done at the bottom of the building, 
[01:38:30]  I would say that once it lost, it's like beams.  What's one of those words you need?  Yeah, I need a word or something.  High beams.  I think it would have tipped over.  I think it would have been more apt to tip over.  I think the heat just weakened the structure on that floor, the high beams, and then that  was it.  When it's so high up, you get, it starts falling, and then it's just falling in a straight line  down on top of it.  But, and you can see the second one that fell.  I think Opie just summed it up. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Da-goo, da-goo, da-goo.  You got to do sound effects.  And then if you look at the second one, which was chopped a little more down.  Da-goo, da-goo, da-goo.  The top did tip over a little more.  Yeah, a little bit.  The top tipped over because it was taken out closer to the middle of the building, so there  was more weight on top, and it did topple a little bit.  They've explained why, I've seen specials on why they fell the way they fell.  It had something to do with the way they, they were-  But that was made by the government, yes.  They were hinged on the fucking, on the metal structure, so the metal buckled out. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  It's kind of like rungs of a ladder falling through, and then the outside buckled out.  It didn't all collapse.  That's why a lot of those pieces came down straight.  Straight.  And the pieces in the middle kind of free fall, because the outside walls buckled out.  And that was why it fell down that way.  If something's fall, if you drop something, it will fall straight down, unless something  interferes with its, uh, with its, uh, little, um, momentum.  Had they double hinged those things, it comes down to, they saved money when they fucking  latched the floors onto the outside structure. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, goddammit.  Not seeing this coming.  Of course not.  But had they, they doubled it, like, was kind of recommended, they said it might not  have fallen.  Had they turned all the screws.  Pretty much, that was it, yeah.  They would have just, if they would have just hammered them all the way in.  Yes.  If they left the nails halfway out to save trouble.  It would have been the nail over.  But I've seen it explained why.  Do you think it's outrageous that the government would allow things to happen for their benefit?  No.  I don't think so.  No, I, I, I definitely think, uh, uh, uh, something.  Look at the Gulf of Tonkin incident.  You'll look at the other way, thinking you're just gonna take a sucker punch, take one of 
[01:40:30]  the ribs, and then you're gonna be like, oh, what they just did, they just punched  us in the ribs.  Now let's go kick the shit out of them.  I wouldn't possibly, like I said, I've tapped out all of that.  Yeah, I wonder though, I, I think the government does allow certain things to happen for their  benefit.  They don't care about the individual.  I want to know why the president gets paid like the same as like an NBA ref.  I'm kidding.  I mean, talk about just opening up a guy.  You offer.  To just sit there and get yelled at by the whole world, no matter what you do.  And you're making like, what's he making?  Three, four hundred grand a year? 
[01:41:00]  If you offer.  This guy's running websites making more than the president.  If you, it's just not right.  If you raise that salary to a million, right off the bat, you're gonna get better fucking  qualified people going for it.  Oh, you make a guy less susceptible to being, to being bribed, I would think.  Although a lot of those guys who run are already million, yeah.  They're all millionaires.  You're already a millionaire.  So other than the ego trip of like, I don't want to sit in traffic for the next four to eight  years, like why, why else would you, is that a direct pay, you think, or does he have  to go to the bank and cash his presidential paycheck? 
[01:41:30]  Well, yeah, I mean, I think food, food is free too.  So that 400 goes a lot.  That's like 600 grand to the, to the regular person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And rent is free.  Let's not forget the rent.  Yeah.  Free travel.  No mortgage.  Travel.  Free clothes.  Guy doesn't pay for anything.  That is the worst fucking job you could ever have.  And then you live in the White House and every time you look out the window as you just  made another decision where they're going to be dropping bombs, you look out and there's  like 400 tourists sitting there with their pictures.  I don't ever want to be flanked because they know someone's going to maybe try to blow my 
[01:42:00]  head off.  That's a four and a grand a year.  It doesn't make any fucking sense.  Who really would want that?  Why would you do that?  John is so fucking true.  Because then you do the college gigs at the end where you make like a million bucks a  night.  That's your golden parachute.  Yeah.  Once you lose the fucking gig, then you can make some money.  Right.  Yeah.  No, no.  You're setting yourself up while you're in office.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Setting up all your buddies.  It's like going to college and then landing the big job.  Yeah.  Then you buy a bunch of land down in South America that sits on aquifers. 
[01:42:30]  What's that?  What's that?  I really don't know.  What is that?  It has to do with there's only so much chicken and fresh water.  Yeah.  You know?  And everybody just keeps banging.  It's going to hit a finite thing.  And at some point, fresh water is going to be, people are going to be coming at you  like zombies.  You're going to be holding gold.  This right here, dude.  This is the next gold bar right here.  Fresh water.  Fresh water.  I mean, it's so easy to distill an ocean and we have like a fucking lot of...  And you know something?  Nature doesn't need that ocean.  We should drink it dry. 
[01:43:00]  There's no way that could ever happen.  I don't think we're having any effect whatsoever on the planet.  Whatsoever.  No, no.  You can't get rid of the water.  You can't get rid of it.  Even if you're using it, it eventually finds its way back into the ocean.  75% of the world.  You could take that, distill it and drink it and have fresh water.  I mean, this man's amazing.  He goes from architectural...  Right now, he's in the sea.  You are the one to...  He's like all the super friends combined.  Well, then how do you know that it hurts the sea? 
[01:43:30]  The same way you can't have the deer population get out of control because it affects us.  This is the thing.  If any species goes over the balance it's supposed to be, it has some sort of effect.  Right.  I'm not saying we're the reason the polar ice caps are melting.  That's true.  I don't know, but you have a fucking effect.  I think you're right, but the water thing has nothing to do with it.  I don't like the idea that a planet's populated with a bunch of fucking filthy animals.  I used to admit how, you know, deers don't drive SUVs.  You know what I mean?  We're way overpopulated and we're doing all that other shit.  Nuclear waste. 
[01:44:00]  Plastics that don't even...  That don't biodegrade ever.  Good shit.  But we're saying that the deer...  You're just sticking it in the ground and shit and it's just like...  But Bill, we're saying the deer are the problem.  That's what's hilarious.  Yeah, the deer are the problem.  There should be a hunting season on humans.  Because the deer's going to, you know, curb us down.  Right.  Yeah.  No, it has to happen.  Because it's a hassle to hit one of them every once in a while.  We've got to calm down the deer population.  It is ridiculous when you think about it.  We'll never run out of water.  Never.  That's the thing.  You make me feel so much comfortable. 
[01:44:30]  The morning shock jock is telling me about the water supply.  I love how you discount me on everything I say.  Because I'm a fucking moron too, okay?  75% of the planet has water on it.  But just, it's the, like, definitive way.  Yeah.  We're going to be okay.  But it's like saying the sun isn't going to burn out today.  You'll be like, well, get out.  Jesus Christ, it could burn out.  It could.  It could burn out.  All right, it could.  But odds are it's not going to.  You see what he does? 
[01:45:00]  No, what did I do?  You just made a fucking halfway decent speculation into something absolutely ridiculous.  We have a planet full of water.  There's more water than land.  And the moon's made out of cheese.  I can do it too.  There's a lot more water on this planet than there ever was fossil fuel.  And we're still using that.  Anthony, you are just as dumb as I am.  Shut your face.  I don't want to hear your stupid theories.  I'm arguing your dumb argument with my dumb argument.  I will say, though, we're going to drink up the ocean.  It's a hard one to sell.  Exactly.  I think the ocean will make it.  I don't literally mean that.  I don't literally mean that. 
[01:45:30]  I think we're going to be okay.  I'm just, okay.  Well, you know, this fish actually getting skin cancer at this point.  They should go deeper.  They're fucking tanning.  Exactly.  You got the whole ocean.  Fucking move.  Get deeper.  Yeah, dumb fish.  They're fucking tanning themselves.  It's because they're fucking sitting next to your rollerblades that you threw out nine  years ago.  They should know better.  If you see a big tank with a skull on it, don't swim up and fucking nibble at it.  Buzz off.  Yeah, they're not tied down to a job.  Buzz off.  They can move.  They can move to wherever they want. 
[01:46:00]  Exactly.  No one's making the fish stay.  There's no zoning line.  You don't have to worry about a mortgage.  Just to us.  Yeah.  Let's play the rest of the Jesse clip, please.  They're half hour, yet they were doing a pre-broadcast back to England that, yes, it's true, that this  building fell and it hadn't fallen yet.  If you're trying to make out the British Broadcasting Company, one of the most respected news organizations  in the world, was inventing huge buildings falling over.  They did.  You need to have a break, Jesse. 
[01:46:30]  Thank you, Piers.  We'll talk about Israel.  No, he's not kidding you.  They fucked up that day.  Period.  Well, they mentioned the wrong building name.  The guy to him is credible.  Guys, he's a wrestler.  Okay, can we just fucking move on from this?  He was a governor, though.  He was that close to the presidency.  That's crazy to me.  Bill needs, like, if you're talking about rockets, you need to be a rocket scientist  or Bill won't even listen to you.  Yes!  Yes!  To a certain point.  I agree with Bill on that, but he was a governor, though. 
[01:47:00]  Can I discuss the weather if I'm not a meteorologist?  He was a wrestler.  Yeah.  How did Schwarzenegger become governor?  Because he was an action hero.  That shouldn't happen.  But then they spout off their little ideas and people, they leap at them.  Reagan was an actor.  He was an actor?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what George Bush was.  He was the son of the guy.  He was a good football player. 
[01:47:30]  That's Harvard.  First Bush or second Bush?  He was a good football player.  Get him in there.  Huh?  Give him a shot.  Yeah.  He was a good football player.  We all know that.  Harvard, was it, or Yale?  Yale.  He didn't go to Harvard.  He was a C student at Yale.  Yeah, of course he didn't go to Harvard.  My favorite election was 2004.  I know I've said this before.  When your choices were two white guys who both went to Yale and were members of the Skull and  Bones.  Okay, which one do you want?  But anyone can become president.  That is funny, man.  Anyone can become president, though.  It's almost like they were trying to, if there was anything going on, like that was the year 
[01:48:00]  that they were trying to get caught.  That was.  It's got to be exhausting being Bill Burr.  No, but that's...  I like that point, though.  With all that shit going through your head, like, oh, they're looking.  Dude, this guy, I have more fun just mocking Anthony's tweets.  When you tweet, do you have like a two by four in one hand as your thumb is going?  He writes all this stuff like, hey, Obama, have fun at your fundraiser today. 
[01:48:30]  Meanwhile, this is going on now.  And it's like capital letters.  He shows like a burning embassy.  Yeah.  This is what he's doing.  He's actually saying to me, God, it's got to be so taxing to me.  He's trying to solve the world's problems over Twitter.  I'm just...  78 characters or less.  I'm just throwing in my 140 characters of opinion out there.  I'm not trying to change the world, that's for sure.  And I like riling people up, okay?  I like when people start tweeting back and they're all angry. 
[01:49:00]  It's fun.  Twitter's an obby.  It's fun.  What?  Come on.  What's the matter?  Be honest.  You froth at the mouth while you tweet.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Occasionally, I do.  You do.  But for the most part, I'm sitting there...  Ah, this country is doomed.  Doomed.  I do like saying that the country is doomed.  If only everyone thought like me.  Exactly.  Yeah.  You're a great guy.  You're very live and let live. 
[01:49:30]  Fucking Bill.  You have just a wonderful...  If only everyone could be like you, Anthony.  Exactly.  Everything would work.  Oh, as opposed to a world of Bill Burr's out there.  Not at all.  I don't tweet shit like that.  I'm a fucking moron.  I'm not saying I have any great intellect.  The last book I read was about Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.  Nice.  I'm not saying I have any great intellect.  I was supposed to say how shallow I am, and Opie's just like, nice.  Nice.  Yeah.  I would read that book.  There's a feather on his cap.  It was actually a great book. 
[01:50:00]  I would read that one.  It was a great book.  We should take a break.  Bill Burr is here.  I don't think we have to sell Carolines, right?  That's got to be selling really well.  But Thursday through Sunday at Carolines, 212-757-4100 for Bill Burr.  And we're going to continue.  Oh, Mike Rowe is coming in today.  We haven't seen him in a couple of years.  Did we have an issue with the guy?  What happened?  I don't think so.  That's you on Twitter right there.  The guy with the hat.  That's Imus.  I know.  Oh.  Jesus.  Jesus, Bill.  If only everyone was just like Murray.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM. 
[01:50:30]  New from Puddin' Head Records, Opie and Anthony present Sittin' and Singin' The Handicap Hits.  I'm rollin' with the devil.  Yes, I'm rollin'.  It's all the rock you know and love.  Done specifically for people without leg mobility.  Just because your legs don't work doesn't mean your ears don't. 
[01:51:00]  Just ask Van Halen.  I wish I could jump.  I'm never gonna jump.  Might as well just sit here.  The hits just keep rollin' in.  If only they could walk.  Ah, yes.  I would roll 100 miles in.  I would roll 500 more.  But my hands would hurt cause I'm rollin'.  Get it?  I sit in the chair that you're in. 
[01:51:30]  Now face north.  Roll around 90 degrees and still just sit here.  It's sittin' and singin' The Handicap Hits from your pals at Puddin' Head Records and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah, this is The Opie and Anthony Show.  What a treat. 
[01:52:00]  We got Bill Burr in studio today playing Caroline's this weekend starting Thursday.  Thursday through Sunday.  You gotta do the Sunday night show too.  I was gonna say playing foil to Anthony.  Yes.  Isn't that my position on here?  That's pretty much it now, I think. 
[01:52:30]  No.  We used to scream at each other.  Yeah, we used to.  Now I don't care enough anymore.  And older and wiser, Bill and Anthony.  212-757-4100 for Caroline's.  I mean, these shows are gonna sell out, so.  I'm going Friday.  Yeah, I'm going.  I gotta figure out what day for myself.  And I'm hanging for both shows.  Well, that's the land.  Yeah, we almost got a chance to hang up the other night.  We almost hung out at Amy's party, yeah.  I was going down the elevator, he was going up.  You got there late, huh? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, I had just landed.  I came in from Charlotte.  Did you walk into anything fun?  Oh, Joe took a pounding.  DeRosa was taking shit the entire time there.  And people had left by the time you got there.  Colin wasn't there.  He was just shitting on Joe.  Who else was there that was really bashing him?  He had that jean jacket on.  Bobby was killing him.  And I came over, I asked him why he was dressed like Lee Majors.  God, that's a good one.  Yeah, no, that started off a nice 20 minute. 
[01:53:30]  He took it, though.  He took it like a champ.  He took it the whole fucking night.  Keith Robinson was there just trashing him.  We teased him so bad, he actually took the jacket off.  And then he had this awful mustard shirt.  I'm talking about DeRosa.  Mustard shirt underneath it with this horrific not doing push-ups.  Do you realize that day we lost like 50 bucks?  I still haven't paid you.  I owe you money, I just realized.  Uh-oh.  For what?  Oh, some sports thing.  What was our bet?  It was basketball.  Sixers, Celtics. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  Whatever.  I didn't really want to take that.  Don't worry about it.  No, I'll give you your money.  That time when we bet Joe about the push-ups, that was the smallest window.  You know the perfect entry the shuttle has to have or else it burns up?  That was the one moment in Joe's life where he could actually do 20 push-ups because I  saw him the other night.  He didn't do the push-ups.  I lost the bet because my stupid judge doesn't know what a push-up is.  Well, that's true. 
[01:54:30]  Listen, I'm going to tell you.  I'll acknowledge I lost the money, but fuck.  Yeah, but Opie, if Joe did any sort of movement down towards the floor and back up again, for  Joe, that's a push-up for Joe.  You don't have to judge him like he's a Marine.  I mean, he's just a fucking...  Well, when it's a couple hundred bucks on the line, yeah, I'm going to judge an official  push-up, whatever that is.  DeRosa looks like an eight-year-old Andre the Giant.  Yeah.  You got the same body.  You got that Mitt Romney clip, actually?  We didn't play the Mitt Romney explaining the clip. 
[01:55:00]  But you heard about this, right?  Mitt Romney was taped?  Dude, I wouldn't know what that guy looked like if he walked by me on the street.  Romney!  I don't watch any of it anymore.  He's done.  I think it's time to get America back to work!  Like, who could sit there and watch that stupid...  But what got you finally?  Because I'm sure you watched for a while.  What was the tipping point for you?  I think it's just being in comedy.  I don't like watching comedians who pander to the crowd.  Yeah, yeah.  You give yourselves a round of applause. 
[01:55:30]  I mean, I just feel like that's what they're doing the entire time.  So Romney was...  I think it's time to give tax cuts to the people that deserve them!  I mean, that's going to be the easiest shit ever.  That's...  Yeah.  Easy applause right there.  Yeah, it is time.  Yeah, he's right.  Oh, God.  There's a lot of patriots in the world.  I might be prejudiced, but I think the biggest patriots are in this country!  Yay! 
[01:56:00]  Yes, President Guy!  President Guy.  That is so fucking great.  We should force him to be known as President Guy.  President Guy.  Every time.  President Guy.  In four years, I envision America that's back on top!  Some people might think I sound crazy, but I believe in equal pay for equal work!  They never say anything controversial.  Are you saying they're all applause-generating statements? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, there's not one controversial statement.  You know, times are tough.  We're going to really have to cut some corners here and make some hard decisions.  Boo!  Boo!  Dude, that's our fault.  That's the public's fault.  Fucking, uh, who was it?  It wasn't, uh, it was Mondale said, we will have to raise taxes.  He lost 49 to 1.  So the public has said, tell us the truth and we will fuck you at the point.  Yes, that's right. 
[01:57:00]  They don't lie for no reason.  Was he the last guy that was honest?  I hope so.  I think you might be right.  They have taught us that if they tell us the truth we don't like, we're not going to forgive them.  We're not going to fucking pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.  We're going to fucking murder them and go with the guy that sold the bullshit better.  Yeah.  So we've asked for that treatment.  We just suck.  We really are terrible.  That's a society.  49 to 1.  That's the biggest landslide in history.  Let's be totally honest.  The question is, what state did he win that year?  Not even his home state.  I don't remember.  It wasn't his home state.  Because I would have assumed it would have been his home state. 
[01:57:30]  No, it was not.  It was him and Ferrara.  What was the dumb state that decided, okay, we're going with this?  I'm going to guess it was like...  Actually, not the dumb state.  The one state that was being honest with itself.  Yeah.  I don't remember what the state was.  We do have to raise taxes.  Wait a minute.  I don't want to have to raise taxes, but the people who cook this economy are way too powerful  for even the president to deal with.  So you guys have to pay for it.  That's how it works.  Shit runs downhill.  You don't want to pay taxes. 
[01:58:00]  You got to make more money.  Oh, that's great.  Very good.  Shit, man.  None of them went to jail.  Why do you think that is?  Jesus Christ, that's fantastic.  Well, Mitt Romney was taped back in May, I guess.  But they're releasing all the audio now because, you know, we're so close to the election. 
[01:58:30]  It'll sting a little more.  And Romney had to talk about the tape.  Chance of winning, 74.6.  They got it right down to the nose, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  What is chance of winning?  What's the chance of winning for Obama?  What is the chance of winning poll?  I don't get that.  Who did they talk to?  Right.  Let's got to do something to do it.  I bet you you get points just for being an incumbent.  It's an MSNBC thing.  MSNBC chance of winning poll.  You know it was 75-25 and they were like, that doesn't look accurate.  Just go 74.6 or 25.4.  Knock a little off. 
[01:59:00]  No one's going to question the numbers.  It can't be right on like that.  Right, of course.  It's like on your taxes.  If you claim $20,000 and something, it looks like a made-up number.  You have to throw in like, you know, $20,141.18 because that looks like you really added  up the receipts.  Because no one wants to deal with that.  You just don't want to deal with the, whatever.  Romney, what, a little press conference to explain the tapes?  Yeah.  That were leaked?  Here it is.  California tonight. 
[01:59:30]  The taxes saw themselves as victims or weren't the type of responsibility for their own  lives and their own futures.  Do you have any response to that?  What did you mean by that?  Well, you said a number of things there.  And the answer is that I'm talking about the political process of drawing people into  my campaign.  Of course, individuals are going to take responsibility for their life.  And my campaign is about helping people take responsibility and becoming employed again.  Pause that, Sam.  This is why they're hateable. 
[02:00:00]  This is why they're hateable.  Helping people.  First of all, that's what he, if you're going to say shit like that, that's what he should,  that's how he should have sold it.  But you can't backtrack after you said these people are not going to take responsibility  for their own lives and say, well, my campaign is going to help.  Just fucking, this is why they're hateable.  What did he say?  He was basically caught at a fundraiser just talking to some guys saying, and what he said  was fairly accurate, at least to his campaign he was going, 47% of the people, he was saying  that Obama's got them.  They pay no income tax.  They're not going to take personal responsibility for their lives. 
[02:00:30]  What I have to focus on is the 5 or 10% of independence, which is truthful.  That's what he has to focus on because he's never, he goes, because if I talk about tax  cuts, they don't care because they don't pay taxes.  So they care about taxes for the rich.  And then they write, right here on the cover of the paper, Mitt Romney says 47% of Americans  are freeloaders.  Which is not what he said.  It isn't what he said.  Hey, they're freeloaders!  What he said wasn't the nicest thing, but it was fairly honest and accurate.  He probably should have phrased it better.  And he did mean his campaign, not his presidency.  He needs, he doesn't have to cater to those people that he knows are going to vote for 
[02:01:00]  Obama.  Like, he needs those undecided voters.  But you look at, he's basically saying, look, 47% of people, they're not going to vote for  me.  They're not voting for me.  But, you know, I probably got 45 and then there's this up in the air group that all I  got to do is focus on that guy.  Yeah.  That's what he meant.  He didn't mean, when I become president, 47% of you can go fuck yourselves.  But this is what we train them to do.  As much as, as much as we want them to be honest, we hear an honest clip from him and  what happens? 
[02:01:30]  Everybody calls him out on it.  Yeah.  It was like, we all, why would that reporter say, what do you mean by that?  It's obvious what he's going to mean.  And this site is so slanted to the other side.  Look at this.  Underneath here it says, Clint Eastwood still won't admit that his RNC speech was terrible.  What a great headline.  Like, was, was, you know what?  She got me.  You know what?  It was terrible.  Thank you, person with a different political point of view.  I like breaking it down though.  It makes me feel like they're just following him around.  Just admit it.  Just admit it.  Come on.  Come on.  He still refuses to admit that what he did was terrible. 
[02:02:00]  It was horrendous.  Like, who cares?  He's just a dumb actor.  Like, you know, why would anybody focus on this?  He's just a dumb actor.  All of them.  That should be, like, I don't understand how that's not career suicide.  Like, no one should ever see a movie again.  If you show up at one of those, that desperate housewife where she was just like, you know,  I don't need a tax cut now.  But back when this girl was working at Wendy's, I was shut up.  I get it.  You're still one of us.  Right.  Just a regular person trying to make it in the world. 
[02:02:30]  Let's hear him grovel.  Yeah.  He is fucking, I want to like Mitt Romney.  I just can't.  Employed again, particularly those that don't have work, this whole campaign is focused on  getting people jobs again, putting people back to work.  This is ultimately a question about direction for the country.  Do you believe in a government-centered society that provides more and more benefits, or do  you believe instead in a free enterprise society where people are able to pursue their dreams? 
[02:03:00]  I believe the latter will help more people get good jobs.  This is a campaign fundamentally about how to help the middle class in America and how  to bring people.  You know, they should be, they should be playing sweet Georgia Brown, that, that Harlem Globetrotters.  They should always have like the press ask the question.  Now, what did you mean when you said that?  Then it's like, what I was trying to say.  Well, through the magic radio, we could do that.  We could do that for you.  Bobbing and weaving.  Why don't we do that for Bill Burr at E-Rock? 
[02:03:30]  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Let me know when you're ready.  He'll take an hour because he's looking up, Sweat Georgia Brown.  Dope.  Because he can't spell.  Of course.  You got it?  All right.  Back to the clip.  And how to bring people out of poverty into the middle class.  And we've seen the results of the last three, four years, and it has not worked.  My approach is...  He's bringing the song down when they ask the question.  And rising take on pay.  Dusty?  You're not stepping away from anything you said in this video, are you? 
[02:04:00]  You're not backing away from it.  And do you worry you've offended this 47% who you mentioned?  Well, um...  Don't even give a fuck what he's saying.  Then I did in a setting like that.  That's fucking great.  Oh, shit.  I'm sure I'll point that out as time goes on.  But we don't even have questions given the snippet there, nor the full response.  And I hope the person who has the video would put out the full material. 
[02:04:30]  But it's a message which I'm going to carry and continue to carry, which is, look, the president's  approach is attractive to people who are not paying taxes because, frankly, my discussion  about lowering taxes isn't as attractive to them.  It will work better if he has shorter answers.  I'm likely to draw them into my campaign as effectively as those who are in the middle.  This is really a discussion about the political process of winning the election.  He's all the way into the saxophone solo on this answer.  And, of course, I want to help all Americans. 
[02:05:00]  All of them.  All of them.  All of them.  Have a bright and prosperous future.  And I'm convinced that the president's approach has not done that and will not do that.  Yeah, Garrett.  Well, Governor, this is now a time where you've made comments at a fundraiser to donors that  are different from what you say on the trail, either in terms of policy, or at least in this  case, in terms of tone.  What assurances can you give the voters that you're not saying different things to people  who fund your campaign than what you're saying to them in public and on the street?  You're coming to my fundraisers, and this is the same message that I give to people, which 
[02:05:30]  is that we have a very different approach to the president of the trail.  Very funny.  Very funny.  I wouldn't listen to that shit.  He wasn't lying.  I mean, and it makes perfect sense, but people, they hear anything.  The best guy ever was that dude out of Cleveland.  What the hell was it?  He was on some debate.  I don't even know what the hell year it was.  But they said something like, they had all these... 
[02:06:00]  Oh, Herbie Robinson out of Cleveland.  Herbie Robinson out of Cleveland.  I don't even get that, but that name's funny to me.  It's a go-to bet.  He's sitting there, and they brought up the Patriot Act, and all these Democrats were sitting  up there, and somebody goes, well, you know, so-and-so, you actually...  He goes, you voted against it.  And he goes, yeah, that's because I actually read it.  And then all the Democrats up there were like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All these freaked out looks on their faces, because none of them even fucking read it.  I didn't read it either.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  He goes, I actually read the fucking thing.  He destroys on it.  And I don't know what his name is.  I think it's whatever.  How many pages was that thing?  It's like 700 pages, and they had to read it overnight or something before they signed  it?  Yeah, I don't know.  There was a whole thing around that.  Dude, it's all how their aides feel, because they...  Like, even the Supreme Court justices, they get briefed on things.  Right.  They never read these things.  They just get a synopsis.  So the point of view of the aid is very important and very influential.  Of course.  Because the senators, all of them have an aid that...  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  Because that presents the material to the guy that's making the decision.  John Robertson, I think...  Was it Roberts?  The one who said that Obama's thing is a tax, is one of the guys, I think...  No, Kennedy.  Kennedy is the one who has, they said, a very tough process.  Like, he has somebody on this side and somebody on that side as guys who are his aides.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah, and he tries to weigh everything really carefully.  We're trying to find that clip?  Yeah.  Dennis Kucinic, I think.  Kucinic.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's a...  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  He's a Kucinic?  Kucinic.  Yeah.  Whether you like what he says or not, he actually answers questions.  Oh.  Is he from Cleveland?  He's from Minneapolis or something?  Minnesota?  Yeah, I thought he was from Minnesota.  Minnesota.  Kucinic.  No, I think he's from somewhere in Ohio.  Because I believe, and he did something with the Teamsters out there, and he was actually,  he put out a hit on him.  Oh, fuck.  Really?  Yeah, like in the late 70s.  Where's he from, Sam?  I believe you're the only person on the stage to vote on the Patriot Act right after 9-11. 
[02:08:00]  They voted against it right away.  That's because I read it.  Oh.  Look at all those guys.  They're all like, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Here's the question.  Here's the question.  Congressman, do you feel, as you've felt on other issues, that those who voted for the  Patriot Act, and there are several here on this stage, bear responsibility for the way  this individual, this American citizen is being treated when he goes through an airport?  Now, I, you're owed an apology. 
[02:08:30]  You really are.  And every American should be able to present themselves without having to be further scrutinized  based on, uh...  He's from Ohio.  But what he's saying is, like, I understand what's that point.  This guy's had a good laugh.  But it's unrealistic.  Yeah.  No, no, I'm not saying his point.  No, no, no.  I'm just talking about a guy who, if you ask him a question, he just answers it.  He actually says what he's feeling.  Whether you agree with it or not, I actually like this guy.  There's something to be said about that.  Yeah, because you know what he's thinking. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, what do you think about that?  Do you like that?  No, I don't.  Rather than be like, well, you know, there's a lot of ways to look at stuff.  It's complicated.  We've got to break this down.  What do you mean by that?  Ron Paul is like that.  He said something I didn't necessarily like, but, I mean, it was about accepting blowback  for 9-11.  And people were booing him, but he's like, hey, look.  And he said what he wanted to say, and I respected him a lot for, you know, he just  answers questions, like you're saying.  My favorite is when they ask a question and they just go somewhere completely else and  be like, I do plan on raising taxes during your presidency. 
[02:09:30]  And he just goes, you know, America is a great country.  It's like, where the fuck is he going?  Where the hell is he going?  Where did he go?  He just walked right out of the room.  Now we're in a grassy field.  They fucking do that constantly.  And they'll touch on one word that you ask.  They'll go like, well, you know, taxes.  No one likes taxes.  But my plan is, and then they'll just go completely.  They'll just touch what you said and walk away.  Yes.  That's fucking funny.  I hate that.  I've watched stunned.  That's like someone who touches you while you're talking. 
[02:10:00]  You ever done that?  And the man who makes you shut up?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As you're talking, they just sort of touch your shoulder.  And then you sort of taper off your sentence.  Patrice said, Geraldo Rivera did that to him.  And he said, on a talk show, because, you know, Patrice would over-talk anybody.  And he said, Geraldo touched him.  And he goes, and I shut up.  It worked.  Like, he couldn't believe it.  Oh, man.  Geraldo was such a pro.  He shut Patrice up by touching him on the talk show.  And he didn't realize it at the time.  Oh, shit.  That's what I needed.  I never figured that out in 20 years of knowing him.  I think that was Hannity, right? 
[02:10:30]  No, no.  It was Geraldo.  Oh, was it on Hannity?  I don't remember.  I think they both were on Hannity at the same time.  Reach over and touch him.  Yeah, because there's something dominating about when a person puts their hand on you.  It's like your instinct is just to let them talk.  No, you shut up, and I'll talk.  Yeah.  Good old Geraldo.  What else is going on?  Enough with the politics.  We got Mike Rowe coming in at 9 o'clock.  No hockey.  Fuck.  And I don't even care.  Do you care?  The NHL, I swear to God.  They're stupid.  It's like they have a fear of success.  Every time they bring it around, and the game is at the best it's ever been. 
[02:11:00]  I got to be these lockouts.  I'm sick of the owners, like, having their lawyers look at the deal, agree to the deal,  and then years later see that they're not getting as good a deal.  Right.  So they got to start over.  We're going to take our stadiums and go home.  Right.  And everybody just has to sit there.  But I don't see an outrage by the fans.  We've had it.  Enough.  It's the worst time to have a lockout, too, at football season.  I think it's part of the game now.  I think it's part of the game.  Like, every six, seven years, there's just not going to be hockey for a little bit.  And then they got to start over. 
[02:11:30]  They had to start over again.  They had a nice momentum going with hockey.  They really did.  Yeah.  You know, the profits.  Everything was up.  Everything was going good.  Good time for a lockout.  What were the owners saying?  Like, they don't like the deal?  I swear.  I don't know.  The split is the players were getting, like, 57% of the revenue share.  So their initial offer was that they wanted the players to go all the way down to 46.  They literally want them to get less than 50%.  Wow.  Like, whatever.  54% of the reason I go to a game is to look at the arena. 
[02:12:00]  Is that what you're telling me?  I mean, they got to be at least 50.  But you know what they're doing.  They're asking for...  It's like when the NFL owners go, one of their things they put on the table was to go up to 18 games a season.  They knew nobody was going to do that.  But that's just so they can...  Well, look, we took that off the table.  Right.  Like, they're actually negotiating.  Yeah.  The disposable bargaining chip.  Yeah.  So players have actually gone all the way down to, like, 53 point something percent.  Like, the players are actually being, look, how about this?  And they're still playing hardball. 
[02:12:30]  What do you think they want?  50-50, the owners?  In the end, at the very least.  Well, I mean, ultimately, they probably would want 46 if they would agree with it.  But, yeah, I mean, if they're going to say 46, yeah, I don't know what they want.  They probably would grab 50.  But in the end, you know, the fans will suffer.  We'll fucking have to pay more.  But didn't they sign the agreement, the owners?  Yeah.  Their lawyers look at it, and then they sign it.  That's what happened in the NFL.  And then the NFL owners realize, like, wow, the players really made out in that, and we didn't.  So then they just go, well, it's a lockout. 
[02:13:00]  We're not letting you into the stadiums.  And I don't know.  It's really childish.  A lot of those guys will just go to Europe and play.  They don't give a fuck.  The only thing for the fans to do is to not show up.  Like, if people stop showing up, well, I'm saying.  But, I mean, that's what you have to do.  That's why I don't go to games.  Because I hate the way they run things.  Baseball was fucked.  What was it, 94?  Yeah.  Baseball was fucked.  But everyone said, oh, we forgive.  And they came back.  No, no, no.  It took a little while.  It was the Royder.  Everybody got all roided up.  Oh, right.  It was the whole McGuire.  And all the records broke.  That's right.  Yeah, that was real, like. 
[02:13:30]  McGuire Sosa.  Yeah, it was dead in the water.  And then all of a sudden, all these great records started falling.  Hey, look at this.  Yeah, he's jacking fucking.  Bunting home runs.  Jack and falls.  Bunting home runs.  1998 was one of the greatest years ever in baseball.  We had the home run thing.  The 98 Yankees were one of the greatest teams you'll ever see.  116 wins?  Ever see.  Was it 116?  116 wins?  What the fuck?  And that was before, you know, Steinbrenner went nuts.  Like, that was a core, like, Yankee team and, like, great trades.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:14:00]  All O'Neal, all those guys, right?  I think they switched out the balls, too, man.  They've actually debunked that thing, I think.  You think?  They didn't do that.  I think they switched out the balls, man.  They really do.  There's some guy I read in Sports Illustrated.  It's hilarious.  He's, like, this nerdy guy, and one time in, like, 6th or 7th grade, he just had a perfect  swing, and he hit a home run, and he was so psyched, and he never did it again.  And he's just been obsessed with what makes a ball go out of the park, and he's done all  this crazy research about cork bats and juiced up balls. 
[02:14:30]  I do, I do.  There was something about sticking it in a humidor in either Arizona or Colorado.  I'm too fucking stupid to remember what I read.  But it did have an effect with the ball not going out of the park.  They actually, they brought it down.  Like, I think in Colorado, that's what they did.  They stick them in something just to try to keep it into the park.  And then in Arizona, they could have done the same thing, but they had a problem with  fans showing up to the game.  So they're like, nah, let them keep flying out.  We got to get people here.  Right, right.  That's my really overly simplifying 10 pages of shit that I can barely remember. 
[02:15:00]  What do you think it was until that?  That I read on a flight.  What do you think it was in the 60s, the dead ball era?  I think Yastrzemski had like a .301 average, and that was the highest.  Like, I think he was, wasn't he the only guy to bat over .300 that year?  There was like some fucking horrendous.  Maybe they were switching out the recipe for the ball.  It has to be.  And they fucked up.  Well, he's the last guy to win the triple crown.  I want to say he batted either .330-something or .340-something.  I mean, only in this one year, though.  And whatever this year was, and I could be wrong about that .301, 
[02:15:30]  but I thought Yastrzemski had the highest average that year,  and it was a terrible year for hitters.  All I know is when I was a kid, if you had 37 home runs going into September,  you were going to be the home.  You could actually win the home run crown with like 38, 39, 39 diggers.  They barely hit that 40 for a bunch of years there.  You're right.  Well, there was that one year at Jackson when he was on the A's.  He had like 35 or 34 at the All-Star break, and he finished with like 39.  What happened?  I think he just started, because everyone was like, dude, you're going to do it. 
[02:16:00]  You're going to do it.  And he just got up there and, you know.  Ah, freaked them out.  Started panicking.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Is that the year he hit the, Reggie almost hit one out of the stadium with the A's?  Yeah.  But that was, was that when he hit the top?  Is that the same year?  In the All-Star game.  Yeah, he was young and fucking just awesome.  I got a buddy of mine does a dead-on impression of that.  Like dead-on.  Him, Reggie Jackson, literally walking out of the dugout into the on-decks, does the  whole thing. 
[02:16:30]  He does, dude, Jason Lawhead, comedian out of Cleveland.  He does Pete Rose, breaking Ty Cobb's hit season.  He does the thing all the way to him breaking down, crying, and hugging his son.  No kidding.  He does it every year at the Rose Bowl.  He'll do, he'll do, he'll do Ricky Henderson running a ball down in the gap and throwing  it into second base, and you're looking at it, and it's Ricky Henderson, and he goes  all out.  That's fucked up, yeah.  No, and it's like everybody else is at other tailgates looking at this guy, and he does 
[02:17:00]  like the whole thing and slapping the glove, and he makes the, he makes the break on it.  Dude, he's got Reggie's like trot down.  Is he online?  Let's watch it.  Can we see it again?  No, he doesn't have it online.  I have a great video of it, and he dropped a bunch of weight, and he goes, nah, I look like a tub of  shit in that.  I don't want to do it, but you know what?  Next time I come to town, I'll show you the video.  God, it shows the video.  The video.  Oh, no.  What do you think of the replacement refs for football?  You know, I don't know if this is true, but I heard that they, like, referees' salaries 
[02:17:30]  are like part of their itemized list of expenses, like under, like, towels.  You know?  So, I don't know.  They don't have a leg to stand on.  This always happens, and then they go, well, we're going to hold out like this superstar  referees.  Right.  You don't know their names, but I think they should pay them.  I think the replacements are doing all right.  I know there's issues here and there, but in general, it seems like the game, although  last night, I guess, there were so many penalties.  You mean the scabs?  Yeah.  There were so many penalties in the first half of the game last night, it took over two 
[02:18:00]  hours for the first half.  Yeah, are they unionized, the refs?  You would assume so.  Because why are the players playing if the ref union had a problem, but they would get mad  if other players played while they were on strike?  Right.  Shouldn't they be honoring the strike as players?  Oh, yeah.  You know, football's a great game.  You just launch into that.  And the refs are awful, though.  I think that they should be held accountable for blown calls.  Not the occasional one, but like, you know, and I am not watching baseball anymore, but  I saw that Yankee game where they got fucked by that.  Um, the guy got pulled off first in the final out of the ninth. 
[02:18:30]  And it was like, how does a ref make that call?  And still, and you, and there's no penalty for blowing it like that.  Yeah, and it was truly a blown call.  I mean, that was a, that wasn't a balls and strikes call, or that was a terrible fucking  call.  And like, they do it in every game, they do it in every sport, and they just, they can  just keep doing it.  You guys remember when that guy blew that guy's, uh, perfect game?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No, but he just kept saying, the kid threw a perfect game, and I, I kicked the shit out 
[02:19:00]  of that call.  Like, I kicked the shit out of it.  I kicked the shit out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's where Bud Seelig stinks.  Bud Seelig should have just done the right thing.  Bud Seelig stinks.  Sometimes you just do the right thing.  We did that whole fucking break.  We spent hours on that.  Yeah, baseball is going to be the worst of all of them.  It was so obvious.  It was a blown call for something as special as a perfect game.  It was all choked up.  And the outcome doesn't change.  You just do the right thing.  Yeah, Bud Seelig's a cunt.  You just do.  But he's like, oh, no, then there'll be all these other calls.  How about this?  Only ninth inning, two out calls when a perfect game's at stake.  Right.  You fucking Milwaukee hunk of shit. 
[02:19:30]  Right.  Then we'll Dr. Creep.  Then we'll go down that road again.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You're right.  Yeah, I hope he grabs his chest and fucking falls into a hole.  What do you think?  I'm going to hate him.  The Pats had a tough loss this weekend.  You know, I was at the Panthers game, so I missed it, but it looked like a brutal game.  I was watching it.  It looked like we couldn't score a touchdown, but I was watching my dumb Jets.  All right, you guys, how many times are you going to fall for that?  We're going to win the Super Bowl after week one.  Here we go.  They're all high-fiving at a Buffalo Wild Wings. 
[02:20:00]  On our way.  We're on our way.  We just stopped the Buffalo Bills.  They couldn't be better against the Bills.  They couldn't be better.  It's too early.  And the Bills turned around, and they kicked ass this past weekend.  Right.  It's too early.  It's too early.  You can't look at either one of those games and be like, say that that's the Jets.  He marched down the field.  First drive was great.  What, he marched?  75 yards or whatever it was for a touchdown.  And then the rest of the game, he was a bust.  The entire rest of the game.  And Tebow is just a joke. 
[02:20:30]  Hey, you know, I'd love to have sympathy for you, but I'm not a fan of your team.  I understand.  I understand.  I like how Rex, he's kind of chilled out on the trash talking.  Yeah, he's...  I think they balanced out his meds.  Well, it hasn't worked out for him, so he's got to shut the fuck up.  So, I don't know, whatever.  Smash cut to you guys finally winning, and he's just going to be screaming,  What'd I say?  What'd I say?  We should break before Mike Rowe, I think.  Yeah, I have to take him.  Mike.  All right.  I'll be in Columbus this weekend. 
[02:21:00]  The Funny Bone.  It's a great club.  It is actually a really nice room.  Columbus is a good crowd, right?  Yeah, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it the first time I was there.  We did all right in radio there.  Good old Columbus.  Yeah, they come out, too.  They do.  It's Friday, Saturday.  Three shows Saturday fucking blows.  You have to do three on Saturday?  Two Friday, three Saturday.  Yikes.  Jimmy's working.  I hate doing that third show Saturday.  I don't mind the performance. 
[02:21:30]  No, but I mean, it stinks because you're fucking so used to two shows.  Right.  The third show, you're like, oh, it's just a long night.  That's a long night.  That means you're doing well up there.  Ticket sells.  Or it's just the schedule they have.  Oh, really?  Yeah, of course.  I'd love to believe it was my fucking in demand for me, but no.  No?  No.  Basically, if you were just lighting farts on stage, you'd have a third show Saturday.  Bill Bird, Caroline's.  He'll continue with us, and Mike Rowe joins the program.  Stay there.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel. 
[02:22:00]  On Sirius XM.  Show me penis!  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah!  What's that?  Excuse me, sir.  Can we interview you for Chippa TV for the YouTubes?  We're talking to people in costumes and stuff. 
[02:22:30]  What's your name?  My name is Victor.  Okay, that's a cool hat.  It probably keeps all the rain out of your eyes.  And the sun.  And the sun and everything else.  The moon and whatnot.  I can't breathe with this fucking mustache on.  I had a hat on before, but people kept saying you look like a fucking asshole, so I put the mustache  on, now I can't fucking breathe.  How old are you?  I am 18.  Oh, cool.  Okay.  Because I can't talk to nobody under 18.  I got in trouble for that.  Oh.  What's the little horns on your head?  Like you're very devilish or something.  Oh, no.  You're supposed to be cat ears, but I didn't.  Cat ears?  Oh, cat ears. 
[02:23:00]  I thought you said cat ears.  I'm like, what are you playing golf or something?  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah!  Fucking home run, Chip Chipperson.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  That's a good point.  Really fast being called out here. 
[02:23:30]  You're fucking insane, Opie.  The season has been full of these scabs holding up every fucking game in the NFL.  I didn't notice really when I was watching the Jets steal.  It's a game for the most part.  Somebody says that the refs don't have a union, so that they're not scabs.  Not someone.  Our pal Tyson Walter, who played in the NFL.  Okay.  So then they're not scabs.  You've got to have a union to have scabs, right?  No.  Tyson knows what he's talking about.  They don't have a union.  Tyson's full of shit!  All right, then answer me this. 
[02:24:00]  Jack Dunphy's full of shit.  Where's the Mike Rowe?  I don't know.  He's held up in...  Traffic or something?  Yeah.  Okay.  I just made that up.  That's good enough for me.  Hey, Bill, how's the podcast going, man?  It's going good.  You love it, huh?  Yeah, I actually do enjoy that.  I had little problems uploading it, as always, yesterday.  So now I'm going to be using another person.  I'll probably use Dropbox.  Oh.  That was hard to work. 
[02:24:30]  I tried Dropbox.  I couldn't figure it out.  I'm terrible at that shit.  Dude, I had to talk to my web guy.  He was trying to teach me how to land a plane.  I was on the phone for 45 minutes.  I was like, what?  Where does it go?  Aren't you afraid of using something like Dropbox, that you're going to click the wrong  thing, and then people can just go in and get everything off your computer?  That's my greatest fear, is that I'm going to put the wrong fucking folder in there that  says everything on it.  Everything.  Cock pictures.  Not yours.  I get worried about that SoundCloud. 
[02:25:00]  Louis had a great bit about that on some talk show.  I forget what he was talking about.  But basically, it's just weird that you give them your photos.  I don't use any of that crap.  I don't like that shit at all.  iCloud stinks.  It can all be hacked.  I don't use any of it.  I don't want that shit going to some fucking make-believe cloud.  The biggest lie out there is this site is secure.  Secure, yeah.  Yeah, none of them are secure.  Give me a fucking break.  And then there's another little thing that you could take pictures, and it automatically  sends them to loved ones' phones. 
[02:25:30]  What?  Yeah, like they'll get your pictures right when you take them.  Take pictures and all?  Apparently, I guess.  Well, that's for people who aren't being seedy sexually.  Right.  This is probably for people that are actually interacting on a healthy level.  Like, hey, send this picture to your wife.  It's like a fucking landscape.  Where they're very excited about this new technology.  Oh, I love it.  I can see my grandchildren.  Yeah, but there's something still.  It's just annoying.  I don't need to see every fucking time you take a picture of an apple. 
[02:26:00]  You know?  Exactly.  But it can also be set up fraudulently where maybe you can go into somebody else's phone  and set it to send to your phone.  So if they're doing some shady shit, if you're out, you take a picture with a girl, your chick  gets it.  Yeah, that's what nerds do instead of playing sports.  Like, that's their sport is they go in there.  And I can see how much more fun that that would be.  Oh, way more fun.  It seems like, right?  Yeah, acting like you're a spy.  Yeah, you could be a spy.  Who doesn't want to be a spy?  I can see quickly how that would get out of control. 
[02:26:30]  We were just having fun.  I know.  You're being led away in handcuffs.  Into a black van.  Not even into a police car.  I wanted to pick a superhero movie and I couldn't remember the name of it.  What's the one that had all of them in it recently?  Avengers?  Avengers, yeah.  The Avengers t-shirt.  Was the Hulk in that?  I didn't see it.  Oh, he was.  From what I heard, he was in it and was awesome.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  The Hulk had a tremendous performance in that. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Little purple shorts.  Where's Mike Rowe?  He's in traffic.  Still?  I was right.  Oh, wow.  So, I'm talking about Mike.  Jimmy and I was, it is correct.  It is my guess.  I thought Jimmy was guessing.  I was, but I was like, where else could he be?  Where in traffic is he?  Cross streets.  I can get the address.  Yeah, please.  Yeah, please do.  Just get the general.  Tell him just to go home.  It's too late now.  Stupid shot.  I hate that Sam's in an apple.  What is, what is he promoting, by the way?  Because, um...  We've got a menu series.  How Booz Built America. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, are they going to touch on the Kennedys and shit with this?  I guess.  How Booz Built America?  He is bootlegging.  Oh, I'm sort of reading that book, Sins of the Father.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This guy just takes Joe Kennedy out at the knees, like, the whole book.  But so much of it is just like, well, he did this.  Did he do it because of this?  Or maybe it was that.  It's just like, oh, Jesus Christ.  But he did seem like, he did, like they were saying, like, he did insider trading before 
[02:28:00]  it was considered illegal.  It was just considered...  It was just business.  It was just considered smart.  No, a rascally sort of thing to do.  Well, that's rascally.  Yeah, like, along those lines.  But, like, yeah, he was one of those guys, you know, according to the book.  And this guy definitely had a friggin' axe to grind.  But he didn't seem like somebody you would want to walk away from your checkbook or leave  any sort of thing open because he would, you know, according to the book, allegedly,  he would just rifle through. 
[02:28:30]  He would gain your confidence in your business.  He would rifle through files, get all kinds of information, and then somehow go into the  stock market, manipulate something.  Holy shit.  He basically spent, like, seven months at every job.  And he would go in there like a virus.  Scooping up info.  According to the book.  But the book was just so ridiculously slamming the guy that I was joking with Nia.  I felt like I was reading, like, some summer tell-all.  I should have been digging my toes in the sand like some soccer mom as I read it. 
[02:29:00]  I was like, this is just so...  Can you give the guy credit for anything?  Did he do anything good?  It just got to that point.  Well, he obviously fucked this guy's family.  Yeah, like something.  This guy's grandfather.  It's probably accurate, though, because you figure they put out a fucking president.  An attorney general who probably would have been president and another senator who...  I mean, that was...  You know, Joe Kennedy did something right.  It probably was from doing all that shady shit.  I mean, yeah.  They definitely...  There was definitely a lot of...  I don't know, dude. 
[02:29:30]  I mean, during Prohibition, if you had a scotch hookup, you know, you wouldn't make a little  money on the side?  Of course.  Of course.  Why wouldn't you?  Ah, back in the good old days.  A fucking bottle of booze.  So, I guess...  How old did Prohibition last for?  I'm sorry.  Oh, man.  Was that three...  Was it three years?  No, it was longer than three years.  Was it like...  She was either three or 15.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my God.  Six years.  Six?  Six years.  Long enough for Joe Kennedy to do what he had to do. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, to make a few bucks.  Eleven?  Sixty years?  How long?  Sam?  Sam.  Prohibition was a major reform movement.  No, that's not a long...  We don't need a definition of Prohibition.  Just how long?  Give us years.  Ten years.  There should be a dash in between some numbers.  Four months.  You've just said every possible...  Yeah, I'm just blurting out what people are saying there.  Three hours.  Three hours.  It only lasted three hours.  No, no.  We're not talking about a cooliest compound.  That book that I'm reading, it basically says all of Joe's kids died because he was a dick. 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  That's what it means.  That's pretty brutal.  The kids pay for the sins of the father.  Right, yeah.  That's basically...  So that's what they're saying?  That's what he was saying?  Wow, that's pretty fucking brutal.  That's why I don't believe in that kind of karma stuff.  It's like, bad shit should happen to the person who did it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you shouldn't...  Yeah, this guy does that, so then his kid falls off his tricycle.  Although, if you think, karma would probably work that way because you'd want to fuck the  guy up as badly as possible and the kids and everything. 
[02:31:00]  1919 to 1933.  Wow.  14 years?  Wow.  Really?  All the 20s had no booze?  The roaring 20s?  Well, that's why they were roaring.  No, it was...  Because it was like all about fucking illegal booze and fucking speakeasies and flappers.  Oh, right.  Yeah, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  It's a fast motion.  Yeah.  How do you know flappers?  They just opened a comedy club in Burbank called Flappers.  And I was like, why do they always give it a zany name? 
[02:31:30]  And then somebody goes, no, Flapper was a dancer in the...  Dancer back in the fucking early days.  It's a wacky name, though.  In the roaring 20s.  In the roaring 20s.  Than flailers.  Yeah.  They were the whores.  They were whores back in the 20s.  In Boardwalk Empire, they have a cool scene where the guy's playing, I think, Eddie Cantor.  He's doing jokes.  And he's doing...  Like, back then, the comics sang.  And he did a little bit of everything.  But it was kind of fun to watch a comic song and dance number.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, now I'm going to do a little soft shoe for you.  You know what, dude? 
[02:32:00]  My wife said, take me where I'd ever been.  Dude.  I took it to a skinny guy's house.  You know what, dude?  You got to think positive, dude.  You got your white water fountain, your black water fountain.  Boom!  I'm living the dream.  Prohibition Bobby.  Yeah, Prohibition Bobby.  Who wouldn't want to see that?  Yeah.  I just realized how little I know about history, because I so want to pile on it.  I know.  I have no reference. 
[02:32:30]  I'm trying to think, like...  Who was president?  Da-da.  Woody Wilson?  Calvin Coolidge.  I call him.  Da-da-da.  Yeah.  Dude, I'm in traffic.  I'm beeping at this guy.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Motorized car.  Get a fucking horse, dude.  Dude, the horse drunk carriage.  You know, dude, if man exceeds a speed of 30 miles an hour, he'll surely perish.  If man were meant to fly, he wouldn't be as fat as me, dude. 
[02:33:00]  You know what, dude?  Sorry I'm late.  My horse had a heart attack pulling me, dude.  And they just bring the lights down, and he's up.  Yeah.  Easy river.  I think he just broke into song.  Yeah, yeah.  I think he did something, and he did that exaggerated.  Whoa.  Whoa.  And the band starts playing.  Yeah.  Oh, when those saints, they go marching in.  The worst ever.  Oh, when the saints go marching in. 
[02:33:30]  Okay.  Who was that?  Oh, Durante.  Oh, he was the worst.  A dink-a-dink-a-doo.  I fucking detest Jimmy Durante.  Can we play him again?  I'd rather not.  I love when we play Jimmy Durante.  He stunk.  They're not Durante.  This guy is fucking famous, too.  I like the subtleties of his performance.  That's Mike Grobe.  Subtlety of his performance.  Oh, Bill, he wasn't subtle.  Here's Jimmy Durante.  Make someone happy.  Wait, this doesn't look like Jimmy Durante. 
[02:34:00]  It's not Jimmy Durante.  This is from 1988, Sam.  It's the killers.  It's the killers.  For me, he's the original Tom Waits.  Really?  Yeah.  Same hat.  Okay.  Oof.  It's so important to make someone happy.  Isn't this using a commercial now?  I like this guy.  It's this version.  He looks like a bojirier.  Yeah, he really does.  Yeah, it makes someone happy.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  One smile that cheers you.  I was worried this was going to be overproduced.  Yeah, right?  Jesus Christ.  Just burring his awful voice.  Who enjoyed this?  I don't know.  They, uh, yeah.  Hey, you know what else is great?  They looked at his bloated alcohol nose like it was endearing.  Yeah.  This big, ah, the schnozzola.  It's ravaged by alcohol.  Make one person happy like my drinking buddy Bing when he smashes his daughter in the forehead 
[02:35:00]  with a bottle.  Is the answer?  Someone too long.  Ah, cha, cha, cha.  This was a big hit, I guess, for him.  You don't like this one?  No, I want the one comedically.  A dink-a-do.  Oh, this is the one we hate.  Look at his face.  What's he doing?  He said, kid, you got a face for radio.  Ding.  His arms would be out like this.  A dink-a-dink-a-dude. 
[02:35:30]  Dink-a-dink-a-dude.  You know.  Mine's different, dude.  Dude.  How do you like those guys?  Everybody puts in extra notes.  I'll overlook it.  But the tune for you.  Oh, my God.  When do you talk and when do you sing?  Again.  Oh, my God.  This makes my spine hurt. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, my God.  It's the background singer.  It really is annoying, right?  What's that?  It just reminds me like that fucking Hitler's right around the corner.  Yeah.  What could go wrong?  Everything is sunny.  Baby, I fucking love you.  And then fucking...  Desi Arnaz and Jimmy Durante in fucking color?  Everybody wants to get in. 
[02:36:30]  What?  What does that mean?  He doesn't have a gin blossom nose, dude.  He just has a giant fucking nose.  Really?  I thought he had like...  Hey, someone get the PR off the drums.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hello, Kane.  Hello, Desi Arnaz.  I love when he says his real name like nobody knows who it is.  Why, sure.  Where are you going with that Cuban wastebasket?  I'm going to cheat on my wife again. 
[02:37:00]  Cuban wastebasket.  It's his wife.  Where are you going with that Cuban cum dumpster?  Does the carpet match the drapes?  Ah, cha-cha-cha.  You ever pull a train with Bill Frawley?  Ah, cha-cha.  You ever eat Vivian Vance's asshole after?  I'm not fluent, Jimmy.  I just had a very bad head cold.  Well, you're too close to my nose.  You know, you could wipe out an illustrious career. 
[02:37:30]  What is he doing?  He's tripping.  How long did the canned laughter guy have to wait to push the button before he got that punchline?  Oh, yeah.  You ain't.  You know something?  I'll make a deal with you.  And he'd look at the audience like,  Oh, what's this guy saying?  I'll learn you English.  If you'll learn me Spanish.  That ought to be something.  All right. 
[02:38:00]  But let me ask you something.  Oh, Ricky, let me in.  That's when Lucy's voice was gone at that point.  Ah, Ricky.  Did anybody get older quicker than Lucille?  Holy shit.  Dude, the difference between her talking to Desi and Mr. Mooney.  Yes.  Hi, Tara.  Hi, Tara.  Chiffy, the original Tara Reid we used to do.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe I'm in Europe.  Everybody, make sure you see the new American Pie movie. 
[02:38:30]  It's fantastic.  Yes.  She blew us off.  Yeah.  That bitch.  Lucy on Joan Rivers.  That was probably a good move for her.  Yeah, probably.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what, you're right.  And she's back on TV, Aren't We Lucky?  What year is this?  Life with Lucy.  The living legend herself.  She died in like 88, maybe 89.  89.  Just riddled with cancer from all those Philip Morris cigarettes.  Yeah, she was eating them.  It was fucking funny.  That would have been a good picture, right, Jim?  Lucille Ball.  Yeah.  That's a big one.  They all worshipped her.  Yeah.  Carol Burnett and Joan. 
[02:39:00]  They're all dressed like E-Rock.  The studio audience.  Lucille Ball.  She looks pretty healthy.  Well, Joan.  We might have to find a clip from 88.  How nice.  Get her tobacco voice.  They used to smoke unfiltered cigarettes and have that aluminum foil suntan.  Now then.  How about your sex life? 
[02:39:30]  You know what it is to follow Nancy Reagan?  Yes.  No one can do it but you.  No one can do it.  And then they got Joan Rivers pre-fucking, pre-corrected surgery there.  That was while Carson was looking at her picture yelling, you cunt!  That was around that time.  Yes.  How dare you.  What a cunt. 
[02:40:00]  Yes, I hope Edgar kills himself.  Oh, shit.  How powerful was he that you had to ask his permission to do a talk show?  To do a show.  If you didn't.  Can I have my dream come true?  God forbid, someone goes for their dream, Johnny.  Would that be okay if I try to get my piece of the pie?  Especially since they weren't fucking, they weren't going to offer her the show.  Of course.  And she knew she was not in the running for permanent hosts.  She had every right to try.  I think they said he was mad because she didn't call, like he had to hear it, like she didn't 
[02:40:30]  call and go, hey, I got a show.  She probably was scared shitless of the guy.  That's how that works.  He fucking was a, he was a crybaby.  He was a rough one, yeah.  He was a, let other people fucking, have some competition.  And he hated women, I think, too, because his mother was just such a cunt.  He was a guy who didn't want you to have a show.  Tommy from Brooklyn.  You used to have to call him.  You'd call him day or night.  Yeah.  Fucking talking and singing.  That.  Oh, no, I hate it.  And I would, too.  I'd call him, but not till one in the morning. 
[02:41:00]  And when you called him.  That'd be correct.  And when you called him.  Those stupid background singers.  Your husband feels so guilty that he offs himself.  He drank and took some pills.  But you pick yourself up and you keep on going.  It always comes around positive.  Of course.  You'll never get that death face out of your mind. 
[02:41:30]  Tommy at Brooklyn says, Durrani, it sounds like Ira, our pal Ira.  No.  You don't think so.  A dink, a dink-a-do.  When you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you.  You want some gossip on Lucille Ball?  Yeah.  I've been waiting for this call for many years. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Andy in Cleveland.  What's up, Andy?  Hey, guys.  I grew up in Jamestown, New York, just out of Buffalo, and Lucille Ball was her hometown.  And right about the late 90s, they really started going all in with the Lucille Ball thing.  It was like their way to bring up the town's income on their old hero.  And they had to be very careful about who they interviewed about her previous life when she lived in Jamestown.  Because anybody who went to high school with her about the same time she left for Hollywood will tell you that she fucked her way out of town. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, yeah?  In a huge way.  Lucille Ball was a slut.  It had nothing to do with her talent.  That big fucking red bush.  Yeah.  Did she have a bozo bush?  Maybe that's how she learned how to make all her funny faces.  She was probably awful in the sack.  That's why Ricky was fucking everybody.  Ricky was fucking everyone he worked with.  Yeah.  I had lunch when I did the burn.  I love this gossip from 1950.  I know, I just love New Details show.  Yes. 
[02:43:00]  Brand new.  Jeff Ross's show tapes right next door to where I Love Lucy was taped.  Oh, really?  So the lunch was at Hollywood Center Studios, which is where Lucky Louie was taped.  They do a lot of shit there.  Why, sure, Fred?  Yeah, but you can see the steps going up to the dressing rooms, and there's pictures of fucking Desi and Lucy.  And you can just see that's where he would go up and probably fuck these girls.  You've got to give the tour, Jim.  Yeah, but somebody told me that they would have, somebody told me that she had, Lucy had people watching to see who went up to see him, because she was so fucked.  Imagine your own show, and all you're thinking of is your husband's going to be fucking somebody up there. 
[02:43:30]  Fucking some broad while you're trying to do a scene.  Everybody knows it but you.  Oh, Lucy, I have to rehearse.  Yes.  I have to work the lines over with her.  Come on.  I'm not fucking Lucy.  Why are you taking women up there, Ricky?  Don't run up here.  You have gramps on your feet.  You're unsexy cunt.  You would be a great, you would be a good tour guide.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, keep up, keep up.  If you look up here, you'll see where Desi used to rail bitches in the ass while Lucy was trying to do a scene. 
[02:44:00]  And this red fleck here is actually a piece of blood after she hit him with a stapler when she walked in and caught him receiving a handjob.  I guess we're going to have to say Mike Rowe's not going to make the show today there, Sam.  Well, Roland's blaming it on the rain.  Roland.  What?  Roland.  He probably.  I hate when he does that.  Look, Bill doesn't even know what it is.  He's like, what are you doing?  I literally had to set a rub.  He's rubbing a spot now. 
[02:44:30]  That's Edgar.  That's Edgar.  He's trying to get your attention.  He asks you to get your attention.  Excuse me with his fingernail tips.  Yeah.  It's the worst.  All four fingers?  It's the worst feeling.  Yeah.  Bill.  Isn't that terrible?  It's so intrusive.  You do have to wipe your hand out.  I used to work in this warehouse.  This fucking guy.  Touchy feely dude.  The worst thing ever.  I can't even.  I was standing.  You used to try to avoid the guy.  Make sure there was a table between the two of you if you said good morning. 
[02:45:00]  He just always had to fucking touch you in some weird place on your torso.  So one time I was at the Coke machine.  What the fuck is that about?  I don't know.  The vending machine.  And he came in.  He goes, hey Bill.  And I hear his voice behind me.  And he slapped me on the back on like my left shoulder.  Slid his hand all the way across the back.  And then squeezed my right shoulder.  Like it was a fucking melon.  Oh my God.  Dude, I couldn't shake that for like four days.  You couldn't?  I just like chills.  Slap, slide, squeeze. 
[02:45:30]  Did he want a piece you think?  What was that about?  I don't know.  There's some really effeminate straight guys.  They just are.  I don't know if that's what he was.  But he was, yeah.  Yeesh.  Lucille Ball was still alive when that happened.  That's how long ago that was.  I still remember.  When did she die?  89?  88, 89.  April of 88 or 89.  Hey Sam, how is Roland blaming the rain?  He's saying it's traffic. 
[02:46:00]  Okay.  Where's he staying?  Fucking Hoboken?  Or he listened to the last 20 minutes and was like, yeah, I don't think I want to work.  I don't really think I, yeah.  Well, we'll break then and we'll figure it out.  Wait, wait.  Wait.  Now Roland says bringing him back now.  Oh.  Well, he's going to wait.  We're going to take a break.  I got to pee.  Yeah, we got to pee and shit.  Bill Burr, Caroline's this weekend starting Thursday through Sunday.  Okay, 212-757-4100.  And Jimmy's heading up to Columbus to do the funny bone.  Yes.  The funny bone.  Micro next.

[02:47:30]  Our old pal Mike Rowe has entered the studio.  Just when you thought it was safe, gentlemen.  Yes.  How are you, sir?  Doing great.  What's it been, two years?  No doubt.  Probably around there, yeah. 
[02:48:00]  And do you hold a grudge?  Oh, come on.  What the fuck?  Jesus Christ.  That was nobody's fault.  Oh, my God.  I got to explain to Bill Burr.  What happened?  What happened?  We're over.  Drama on this show?  Come on.  No, we love Mike.  Mike has been doing our show forever.  I don't even know.  At least eight years at this point.  At least.  He's always been one of the best guests we've had.  We love Mike.  And we got in a weird situation where Victoria Gotti was in here.  And Mike Rowe was also in here.  And we talked to him for maybe like five minutes.  But we're going to get back to him.  And Victoria was coming in for a book tour or whatever. 
[02:48:30]  And she fucking scared the shit out of us.  We just sat there and listened to her for two straight hours.  Well, the thing is.  Shut up.  And Mike's sitting there just twiddling his fucking thumbs going,  when are you getting back to me?  And none of us knew how to handle the situation.  It's because it wasn't really a book tour.  It was a book reading.  And what she did was, she said, here's a book I have.  And it's maybe 1,000 pages.  And I thought it'd be cool if I read that all.  If I just read it.  Right now.  300.  For all of you.  We didn't know what to do that day.  It was one of those weird days that we just couldn't get ourselves out of a weird situation. 
[02:49:00]  We ended up sending him booze and everything.  We felt so bad.  You sent me booze.  And I drank it.  Oh, good.  In a display of solidarity.  What a segue.  Speaking of booze.  How Booze Built America.  Tomorrow, 10 p.m. on Discovery Channel.  Now, what does this cover?  The entire history of booze in America?  That's all.  Ah, nice.  Yeah, we want to take a small, modest bite.  So we went with two, you know, enduring institutions.  Actually, what happened was I just couldn't do dirty jobs anymore. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  You finally had it.  Well, it's not done done.  It's just that, you know, each year you'd write down like a slightly different goal.  Like five more, ten more, three more states.  And, you know, 100 jobs, 200 jobs.  So we wound up doing 300 jobs.  We got to all 50 states.  We wound up going to Australia.  And we came back.  And it was like, look, what would a world look like where we just didn't do this for a minute?  You know?  And everybody said, well, we don't know.  What would it look like?  And so we had this big talk. 
[02:50:00]  And what it came down to was, what do you like?  And I said, I like booze and I like history.  So let's do a show about booze and history.  History of booze.  But it really is.  It really is pretty amazing.  I mean, if you look back, you know, from the day the Pilgrims landed, which, by the way, they weren't going to Plymouth.  They were going to Virginia.  They landed in Plymouth because they ran out of beer.  And, you know, beer was the, every single day, gallons and gallons and gallons.  They drank six, seven times the amount of beer we drank.  Their kids drank beer every day.  And so, you know, from the taverns, you know, to the sugar tax, to the molasses tax, to the revolution, to the Civil War, to all through Prohibition, of course, every single major thing that impacted the country. 
[02:50:30]  Booze is always in the room.  The whole thing was a bar fight, basically.  That's all it was.  It's one big, giant bar crawl.  That's exactly right.  Yeah, the fur trappers, you know, that went west were following Indian trails.  But, of course, there was no money back then.  So the only real currency were beaver pelts and booze.  So all the commerce that drove the country west happened because people were trading in alcohol. 
[02:51:00]  And, you know, I mean, it's not the most glorious way to look at the country, but it's actually really cool.  And the more you learn, the more interesting it gets.  And so the next thing you know, you're in a bar recreating.  Carrie Nation, ring any bells?  The Prohibition woman there.  Yeah, it was more like temperance, right?  So it's, you know, 1904.  This is a scene in one of the episodes that I love.  But we do these elaborate recreations that I'm allowed to basically walk through.  So it's like Forrest Gump meets Zelig, you know, and I'm just this guy in a T-shirt and a ball cap. 
[02:51:30]  Suddenly, it's 1904.  We're in Sullivan's Bar here in New York.  You know, John O'Sullivan, bare-knuckle boxing champion.  It's a true story.  And Carrie Nation walks into the bar, who at the time is a little over six feet tall, 200 pounds, carrying a hatchet.  And she had been doing these things called hatchetings all over the country, where she'd walk into a bar and just tear the shit out of it.  She was very angry.  What a bitch.  Yeah.  What did she have up her ass?  Well, you know, a couple of alcoholic ex-husbands and just, you know, just a trail of tears, right? 
[02:52:00]  I bet they were real nice back then.  So she's on the leading edge of making sure booze is off the table.  And the point of this show is to say, okay, there's a moment where John Sullivan, bare-knuckle boxing champion, is running for his life from a lunatic with a hatchet who's tearing up his bar.  And had that not happened, we don't go to the moon.  All right.  Now you've got to figure out how that connects.  Exactly.  And so the show really becomes a look at a series of seemingly disparate events that ultimately push us to the moon. 
[02:52:30]  Did somebody in that bar run out?  And was there a woman who was going to go home, but she got scared in the locker room, so she fucked this guy, Frank Armstrong?  It's like you've seen the show.  Frank Armstrong.  She got all hammered.  Yeah, exactly.  No, but it's, I mean, it's just one of those, I mean, it's an old formula, but you make a crazy claim and everybody looks at you and they go, no, that's not possible. 
[02:53:00]  And then 10 minutes later, they're going, that might be possible.  And then 20, oh, you know what, I can see how this could happen.  You connected the dots.  Yeah, because, you know, thanks.  But is it an accurate connection or is it like six degrees of separation?  That's not possible.  No, it's totally accurate.  I mean, if it were most any other station, we could probably make stuff up, but, you know, Discovery is still clinging to that idea that, no, no, it's the truth.  Right.  And the truth it is.  You know, so Carrie Nation gets you to temperance, temperance goes to prohibition, billions are made in illegal booze. 
[02:53:30]  One of the guys who made all that money is Joe Kennedy Sr.  Joe Kennedy Sr. has John Kennedy.  Wade leads on to Wade.  He gets him elected.  West Virginia, swing state.  And the end of this, Dickard, we will go to the moon and do those other things.  And there you are.  Blah, blah, blah.  Wow, yeah.  We were just talking about Joe Kennedy and booze.  Yeah, you know, you must know a lot about that whole situation.  I just told you everything.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  That's Joe Kennedy.  Something about some booze.  That is so.  I mean, I read a book.  I can read it for you. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we have him read a book?  How do we know that?  Is there audio of that?  I would love to listen to you guys in your uncomfortable silence.  Oh, it's just a right.  Oh, did you feel like you were going to get whacked if you actually said something?  Yeah, that's what I was.  It was uncomfortable because of who her father was.  I mean, even though you knew he was dead, but still.  She was interesting for a while, but then it was obvious it was time for her to go and  none of us knew how to do it.  Yeah.  And we've been doing this a long time.  And trust me, we know how to do it usually.  It was just a weird day, man. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Well, she was really, I mean, she was selling it in that way that, you know, how it gets  very personal in here sometimes.  And she was looking at you.  Yeah.  She was like looking right across this monitor.  Yeah.  And, and, and suddenly I felt, I felt just listening.  Like I had stumbled into, I don't know, like an inappropriate biography or like the reading  of somebody's will.  And I'm not in the will and I shouldn't be in the room.  Oh, shit.  But in all fairness, like you didn't know how to leave.  I didn't.  Because I think you did want to go. 
[02:55:00]  You know what?  It's obvious.  They're not getting back to me anytime soon.  And actually no one's going to be talking for the next half hour, but you didn't know  how to sneak out.  Well, there's got, you know, there's always protocol, right?  Or if nothing else, manners.  And I'm like, I don't know how to, I don't know how to get the hell out of here.  It was a weird day.  It was funny.  How do we know that the Mayflower landed in, in Plymouth because they ran out of beer?  William Bradford was the diarist on the Mayflower and he wrote extensively about it.  We are, we are much spent, especially our vittles and our beer. 
[02:55:30]  But back in 1620.  It's a text I just sent to an Ange who takes care of my kegs.  You need more of a fiddle.  They were also probably exhausted from the trip over.  Like, fuck Virginia.  There's some land.  This is good enough.  Just pull over.  I mean, it's, you've got to remember too, the whole idea of, you know, I mean, today we  don't even think about it.  They didn't have longitude back then, right?  So you don't know exactly where you're going anyway.  You have no, there's no GPS.  You have no idea when you're landing.  How did they even figure that out?  The courage that took back then. 
[02:56:00]  Sure.  Balls.  You take it for granted now.  That's a whole nother story.  Finding longitude is the single biggest mathematical riddle ever solved.  And it was a multi-million dollar prize.  Well, they had to give the people a lot of latitude to find that longitude.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey now.  We're following that.  That was a good one.  Anthony Durante.  That's a good one.  Paging Victoria Gotti.  A latitude and longitude.  How did they figure that out?  Ultimately, I mean, back then it was all the celestial clock, you know. 
[02:56:30]  So if it were cloudy, you just didn't know anything.  But a guy named John Harrison invented a better watch.  A watch that could actually keep time on a boat.  Until then, they were all pendulum clocks.  You put a pendulum clock on the deck of a heaving ship, forget it.  Yes.  But eventually, eventually it was Harrison's invention that figured out longitude.  I saw them trying to sell one of those on Pawn Stars.  Of course, different network.  I'm sorry.  But they were trying to sell one of those.  Somebody came in trying to sell one of those clocks.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  And it was like, no, it was real.  And he wanted like $10,000 for it.  And I think they offered him like $300.  Well, he's got to leave it in his shop.  He's got to make some money.  I don't know.  It's got to be framed.  It's got to be refurbished.  Yeah.  It takes all the work to wind it.  I'll give it $300.  And then the guy took $500 for it and went, I'm going to take my wife out to dinner here  in Vegas.  Every episode.  Every episode.  It's every episode.  Yeah.  He goes like, what do you want for that?  Five grand.  And then he goes, what do you really want for that?  He's like, stop laughing.  And then that's it. 
[02:57:30]  And then they go, 40 bucks?  How about 29?  29.  39?  It's just not selling.  And he goes, 29.  And he always wins.  And it makes me mad after a while.  Like, I just want somebody to-  Call him out on us?  I want somebody to get something that's even remotely worth what they're bringing in there.  Do they walk out ever with their items?  Do they ever just go, fuck the same?  There are people that walk out, and they look more pathetic than anybody else on the show.  Even the people that sell it for too cheap.  The people that walk out, okay, I'm just taking this and leaving the pawn store. 
[02:58:00]  You think I'm going to interview them after they got raped?  Well, you know, I got 18% of what I wanted.  They do.  They say that.  I like the guys that walk out, because I'd like to know how often they come back in a  little while later, because they realize, I can't gamble with this.  It's like, let's make a deal meets the people's court.  Yeah, yeah.  Doug Llewellyn's waiting outside.  How do you think of going there?  Like, honestly, it wasn't pleasant.  I always hated his upper lip.  Doug Llewellyn.  Oh, what a terrible upper lip.  Yeah, it was just non-existent.  Yeah, he didn't have one.  No, it really ruined the show for me. 
[02:58:30]  Mike, how many of those car commercials did you film?  How deep is the ocean?  Holy fuck.  How high is the sky?  I think about 340, actually.  Jesus.  Commercial?  Oh, Christ.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I don't want to get to Ford.  Ford, thank you.  You just don't want to just say, go buy an island and still here.  Still in business.  Come on in.  That's got to be lucrative.  300 commercials for Ford?  300 nationals?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  How many a day?  We got, well, when I started working with them, the old model was one or two a day, right? 
[02:59:00]  I mean, I actually did, we did a spot for the Super Bowl back in 2004 that took two days  to shoot a 30-second spot.  But five years later, we were doing 20 spots in one day.  Wow.  Did you get better or did they get more efficient?  Or both?  I haven't gotten better at anything in a long time, honestly.  But what happened was, we just had a big conversation about just, I mean, this sounds kind of glib,  but just telling the truth, you know?  And the truth of Dirty Jobs, which all that is based on, is no second takes. 
[02:59:30]  We just never do a second take.  And the people are genuine.  It's like, look, you guys hired me because you like this show.  And if you like this show, and we want to try and do a thing over here,  maybe what we ought to do is the same basic thing we do in the show.  And then that way, you know, there would be sense in the world, right?  And I'm like, well, we'll try it.  And so we shot, we actually shot closer to 40.  They were looking to use three or four, but they used 20.  And that changed the whole model. 
[03:00:00]  And so then we were just able to really just approach the whole thing a lot.  We just talked them into only doing one take.  That's the most brilliant thing ever.  You know, this shooting it from 90 different angles and I'm there all day.  Why don't we just do it once, but we do it honest?  That's brilliant.  That is good.  But look, everybody in this room knows the honest answer to the question.  Does it really get better by take three or four?  Usually the first one or two.  One or two, right?  Give the camera guy a chance on take two if you're going to do it. 
[03:00:30]  But performance-wise, I've never seen it get better.  I find myself, honestly, much better after take three or four, for real.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm terrible in the first couple of takes.  Yeah, but what about everybody else in the scene?  That's a good point.  That's why I shine, Mike.  They take my take four and they put it with your take one.  Just one more.  You get more recognized from the Ford commercials or Dirty Jobs at this point?  It's a toss-up, dude.  It really is, huh?  I think the one smart thing I did, which was, again, completely by accident, I made them  let me wear this stupid hat. 
[03:01:00]  Is that the famous hat?  This is the hat.  That's the hat?  I've got 600.  So you have to do the reverse.  If you don't want to get recognized, you just take the hat off.  I take the hat off.  I swear to God, it's true.  Yeah, but as long as you don't talk.  Right.  Right.  You've got that recognizable voice, that deep voice.  Soothing.  Soothing voice.  It just sounds honest and comforting.  It just makes you want to buy a Ford, I would think.  You know what?  I started wearing a hat because I can't stand the whole makeup hair thing on sets or anything 
[03:01:30]  else, and it covers like a multitude of sins.  And then on Dirty Jobs, it was just double practical because there was always shit falling  on your head.  So it's like hats, you know, good idea.  And then with the commercial stuff, I just said, honestly, I mean, you did hire me, right?  Because you know me and you want people to know me.  Right, yes.  Well, this is what I look like.  So that was like the second big, but it was two big barriers.  So no makeup and one take.  One take, no hair, no makeup.  One take, right.  And when you think about it, a lot of people look like me. 
[03:02:00]  So I can't put somebody else out there.  No one's going to know.  And I just do the voiceover for my house.  It's really pretty simple.  It's really pretty simple.  He never even has to show up.  That's the greatest negotiating ever.  Can you negotiate our new deal, please?  Yeah, we need someone like you.  I live in one of those.  That's great.  None of us want to be here.  Don't we all just want the money?  Yes.  None of us really want to do the work.  Let's just exchange the cash and walk away.  I think the car sells itself.  I'll walk by counting the money. 
[03:02:30]  Like whiskey on the frontier.  That's tremendous.  You're doing Deadliest Catch.  Deadliest Catch is still around, yeah.  Yeah, and you've figured out a way to get in there, and you talk to the guys, I guess, after.  Is it after a season?  It's called After the Catch, and it started as kind of a, you know, what if we just did this?  Because I'd always said about the show, as a fan, what people really want to do is sit down with these guys over a beer and just ask them anything they want.  Right?  I mean, pretty much like we don't know.  Yeah, when they're at the pressure of that ship. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, with like 40-foot swells coming over the wheelhouse.  And so we said, okay, let's try that.  And the first year, we went up to a bar in, I think it was called the Lock Spot, maybe up in Seattle.  So it's six crab boat captains and me in this smoky bar around this round table.  It's basically Charlie Rose with cigarettes and whiskey.  Yeah, yeah.  And, of course, you know, these guys are the real deal.  They are themselves.  That's when you really notice it in that bar atmosphere, that little just sitting there and drinking. 
[03:03:30]  Because they all come off like really great guys, but you can't relate to that lifestyle as far as being on a fishing boat and taking a life into your hands.  But you can relate to sitting at a bar.  And these are guys that I think we've all sat at bars with at some point in our life.  The crazy thing for me was about three, four years ago when Phil died.  Yeah, yeah.  Captain of the Cornelia Marie.  I got maybe 10,000 letters. 
[03:04:00]  And I wrote his eulogy and posted it and crashed my server, you know.  And I knew people liked him and I knew the show was a thing.  But what I didn't realize, I mean, really practically, was how relatable they are on a totally different level that you never think about.  Like, Phil's the captain of a crab boat.  He's got two kids.  His kids have troubles.  His crew gives him troubles.  And you never think about it in terms of at home, you know, some guy's watching who maybe works on a construction site. 
[03:04:30]  Or maybe he's a school teacher.  But everything that happens on the crab boat becomes like a microcosm for what's going on in his world.  And that weird sort of connection is real.  And when it was suddenly broken, it was shocking how many people reached out.  So that's still there.  And I think that's why people still watch the show.  Yeah, that was a weird thing, man.  Because you do it.  It's like, oh, you killed off a character on the show.  No, he really died. 
[03:05:00]  Did he die at work or did he die at home?  He died at work.  But he died in such the most, you know, heart-stopping, mundane.  He had an aneurysm, basically, right?  He had a blood clot, an embolism, I mean.  And it took him slow.  I mean, he went down.  He came back.  They went to the hospital.  And suddenly we're shooting a scene, you know, in a Dutch Harbor hospital where he's saying goodbye to his boy.  And goodbye to the cameraman.  And then goodbye. 
[03:05:30]  And it's like fade to black.  And suddenly, you're right.  We got letters from like, okay, man, that was an amazing episode.  So when's he coming back?  Oh, my God.  That people literally are so used to watching TV as, you know, the scripted thing we know.  So all of a sudden, something like that happens.  It's just, you know, it takes people a while to get their head around it.  So he knew he was dying in that moment.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, did he smoke a lot of cigarettes.  First time I met Phil, he had a cigarette.  I swear this is true.  He had a cigarette in his right hand. 
[03:06:00]  He had a cigarette behind his ear that was burning.  Okay?  He had a cigarette on his compass.  Now, to be fair, the 30-foot way, there's green water coming over the bow.  So things are very, very sporty.  So he's got four cigarettes going in and around the wheelhouse.  And I walked in and he says, hey, Mike, how's it going?  And he takes a cigarette out of his mouth, puts it down, puts another fresh one in and lights it for reasons I can't even know.  He's not even thinking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's just moving, lighting, smoking, working, praying. 
[03:06:30]  Every season just seems to get more treacherous.  You would think, I don't know, it would kind of lose its danger element.  But, again, it's so real.  I was watching that ice, those chunks of ice coming down and hitting those guys.  I mean, that, like boulders of solid ice falling on people on the deck.  Why doesn't somebody who owns a crab company just buy a fucking battleship and use that?  An ice cutter? 
[03:07:00]  We've done it.  A battleship?  Buy, like, a destroyer and just go out with a bunch of nets.  It really is.  I don't think anybody...  How about you say, fuck the crabs?  I don't think anybody that's a fan of the show, of that show.  Sits down and eats crab legs anymore without thinking, like, someone really bet their life on this.  There's no doubt about it.  There's no...  You could never...  I freak out if I take a ferry.  I'm dead serious.  I am deathly afraid.  They are getting thrown around. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, the most openest water.  It's freezing cold.  And they're being thrown around.  A calm day to them would be a nightmare to anybody on a pleasure boat.  And that, to them, is like, oh, it's a great day for fishing.  And then the horrible days when they had that hurricane up there, that was insanity to watch.  I'm like, this can't...  Someone's going to die.  The thing that's at night, when they're fishing at night and the water is black, and it's like, if you go in, that is it.  You know what else does it?  They're not getting you.  Drowning would be the easiest. 
[03:08:00]  Yes.  It's those work lights.  It's those sodium lights that they use.  And they create this weird, like, this orange bubble around the ship.  So when you shoot one of the boats from a distance, and you see the sleet and the snow and the rain and everything else coming in horizontal while these guys are working in big seas.  And bathed in this weird, crappy orange thing.  It doesn't...  It looks hellish.  Yeah.  And it is.  You imagine if the crabs had cameras, what their show would be?  Like, you know, they're just going for a snack, and it's just a mass murder. 
[03:08:30]  Crab Holocaust, really?  Yeah, they have their own show about this.  That's what it's called.  Murder from above.  Don't go in the cage, man.  Don't go in the cage.  But there's food in the cage.  Don't go in the cage.  Don't do it.  The crabs blaming each other.  Well, this entitlement society thinks that food should be left in a cage for us.  If we didn't look so delicious, man.  And who would have thought you could get a show, even without the element of the danger,  and the personalities and everything that makes the show so great, there's that point 
[03:09:00]  where they're bringing up that pot, that crab pot, and you're going, did they hit a spot?  Is that going to be full?  You're wondering, and then it comes up empty.  You're like, ah, shit, he didn't get it.  How far down did the pots go?  It's amazing.  They can go anywhere from 200 to 600 feet sometimes.  It's really very shallow water where the crab grounds are.  And then you'll have these drops that'll go for who knows how long.  But no, finding the crab, it's an Easter egg hunt.  But you're right, Anthony, when I narrate that thing, you know, I mean, you'll do four or 
[03:09:30]  five in a row sometimes, and you know, you get a little loopy.  But really, from a clinical standpoint, the show could be called, you know, What's in  the Pot?  Yeah.  Because each scene is like, what's in the pot?  Crab, no crab.  Crab, no crab.  It's crab!  A little big wave.  Run for your lives.  Big wave.  What's in the pot?  Crab, no crab.  Crab, no crab.  It's so freaking cold out here.  What's in the pot?  Crab, no crab.  So, I mean, it's...  New guy.  New guy doesn't know what he's doing.  New guy.  Hey, moron.  Oh, there goes the thumb.  What's in the pot?  Crab, no crab. 
[03:10:00]  That's the show!  It's the show.  But people watch because you never, ever know.  It's like any game show with any reveal, right?  What's behind the curtain?  What's in the box?  You know, what's...  What's in the box?  There's any wonder you have all these shows.  Like, this is like you just describing the show is better than any pitch.  Of course.  John, he gets right to it.  It's like a game show.  Everybody wins.  We do one take.  What's in the pot?  There's no makeup.  Wear a hat.  Everybody's happy.  We're all going to make money.  I want them to call it crab or no crab now.  Do people high-five you after a pitch? 
[03:10:30]  And you know, after the season, I just want to sit down with all these guys and drink.  Can we make a show on it?  And that'll be another show.  Wow.  Because they can relate.  As much as they don't fish, you know, you hit your head and you know, you're trying to  hammer up, you know, a poster.  And you hit your thumb.  That hurts.  It hurts when you get dragged overboard.  We all just hang out.  Who doesn't like whiskey?  One take.  My hat.  Let's do this.  And he doesn't have to leave the bar now.  There's a show.  Jesus, guys.  This mic grows brilliant.  It really is.  Just do an establishing shot when I'm there and then I'll leave and I'll just do the voiceover. 
[03:11:00]  People don't want to see me.  They want to see these fishermen.  Those guys would be the last people you would think could handle celebrity in any way, shape  or form because they are kind of these really rugged, kind of get the job done guys.  How do they?  You get guys like Sig is a fucking star.  Well, what happens is there's a there's like a tipping point in all of our lives, right? 
[03:11:30]  When we realize, you know, maybe our reach exceeded our grasp just a little bit.  You know, it always happens.  But with these guys, it's been fascinating to watch because it's not just like the boats  on the show.  That's not the fleet.  There are 130 boats in the fleet.  Right.  Right.  So you've got six boats that we focus on.  So you've got to imagine up in Dutch Harbor from the Pribilofs all the way over to Accutane.  You know, these guys, they're a part of a community.  And so there's a dynamic within the community of which they're a part that they've got a 
[03:12:00]  wrangle.  And that, you know, it's like you guys going back to your high school reunion.  Right.  Everybody's like, so, Anthony, how's it going?  I think you know how it's going.  OK, it's not too shabby.  It's not bad, actually.  So also they come into the harbor and then it's like, ah, here come the fucking stars.  Here comes Hollywood.  So they got to deal with that.  But now down here, like in the lower 48.  I love that.  That's a show, by the way.  That's another show, Mike.  Deadliest catch, the resentment. 
[03:12:30]  That's another show.  Here comes Hollywood.  I catch flounder.  I don't have balls.  I mean, water's water.  Oh, get him some more makeup, Mary.  It's got to be what...  Here comes Hollywood.  It's exactly right.  But here, like I've been with those guys in half a dozen really nice hotels in Manhattan.  Oh, no.  And what happens is, I think, I mean, look, in real life, they are the best.  But in hyper life, like nobody ever told a crab captain, you know, in season two of a hit show in 180 countries, this is what they expect you to do in the lobby of the Mondrian. 
[03:13:00]  OK, so just note to self, do these things.  But here's also a brief list we've put together of things not to do.  Yeah.  That doesn't happen.  So it's almost like that, like a reverse halo effect, right, where people see you, they want to buy you a...  They expect now that the job is to live up to the hugeness with which people like you and me would look at them and go, wow, you know, it's SIG. 
[03:13:30]  Be SIG.  Yeah.  And what that means is smashing somebody over their head, you know, drinking a pint of Drambuie and, you know, working for four days straight.  He doesn't want to do that.  He just wants to have a shrimp cocktail and, you know, maybe tell a story.  But it's...  Yeah.  They've gotten really good at it.  They've figured it out.  But seasons one and two, ooh. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's 180 countries it's on?  Yeah.  180, wow.  It's a huge show, yeah.  Yeah, Discovery, I mean, Dirty Jobs, Deadliest Catch, you know, most of their premiere shows are in 180-some countries.  Yeah, that's amazing.  No, that's...  It's ridiculous.  Dirty Jobs aired when it was really in its wheelhouse, like in 06 and 07, 08, 700 times a year.  In this country.  You know?  I mean, literally, like, once a day.  That's a lot of people looking at you.  In a stupid hat.  In pig shit and grease and making a poop joke. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, one of the worst, because I guess the claustrophobia that you've been in, is that door on that...  It was almost like a lock, I think, or something, and you had to go into these little compartments to grease that shit and clean it up.  I got something worse just happened to me in Australia.  You're talking about a hurricane barrier.  Yes, that was the one.  In Stanford, right?  It comes up, right?  Yeah.  It blocks the harbor in a storm surge. 
[03:15:00]  You gotta get inside of it.  There's just, like, dozens of these little steel coffins that men have to crawl in and paint and then scrape off all of their barnacles and put on zinc diodes.  It's a horrible job.  But in Coober Pedy, Australia, a couple of months ago, we took the show down under, and I know you're a claustrophobic sort of guy.  You'll love this.  Opal mining.  Have you ever seen anybody mine for opal before?  No.  I can't say I have.  Here's a short version.  It's not like gold mining. 
[03:15:30]  It's not like bituminous coal.  It's not like anthracite.  It's not like any other kind of mining you've seen.  It's you dig a hole, a shaft, really.  So picture a manhole cover about 80 feet deep.  Use an old Caldwell drill to get all the stuff out of here.  And then they sit you on a two-by-four, like a bosun's chair, and they lower you into this hole.  And you're looking for faults and fissures in the rock.  Opals live between sandstone and soapstone.  And if you find this little fissure.  I was going to say that. 
[03:16:00]  I was going to say that.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  So if you find a fissure, then you drill another shaft.  And when you're comfortable enough, you go in with big equipment and dig a whole cavern out.  But the point is, you can't do any of this until you go to the bottom of an 80-foot shaft.  And your shoulders literally are touching the sides.  So if you were, like, an inch tall in the bottom of a Coke bottle, that's what it's like.  Only you're looking up.  And remember the movie with the girl in the well?  It was called The Ring?  The Ring.  Silence of the Lambs? 
[03:16:30]  No.  The Ring.  The girl's in the well, and she looks up.  Man, it's so much worse than that.  Why not make the hole bigger?  Make the hole bigger.  That's a good point.  Why not?  Make a bigger drill.  Because the drill's this big.  And, you know, the more comfortable you are, the slower you work, the slower you work, the poorer you are, the poorer you are, the more pathetic you become.  There you go.  The answer.  So go faster.  Faster.  Smaller holes.  So what are some of the horrible things that have happened?  The rope snaps.  Now you're down there.  Oh, man.  We only had budget for one rope. 
[03:17:00]  Just fill the hole there.  That does happen.  But what's worse, and this happens all the time, because in Coober Pedy, which is south-central outback, there's no Emsha, there's no OSHA, there's nothing, right?  So these holes, there are thousands of them.  Oh, shit.  There are thousands of them.  But they just leave them?  They just leave them.  Okay?  So every year, you know, some tourists will go out there, you know, with their camera and back up into one.  Oh, man.  And they'll find them a season or two later.  Oh, there God's another American. 
[03:17:30]  Do they at least die on the fall?  Oh, no.  No, because even though it's a long fall, you've got this effect.  Oh, you're bouncing off the walls a little bit.  It's like a pinball bouncing off the walls.  That'd be nice.  But, you know, the hard would be falling in head first, right?  Oh, man.  Because you don't have enough room to turn around.  So you spend literally your last five days of consciousness, maybe with a broken back.  You're on your head upside down, 90 feet underground.  Have they found people like that?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  And kangaroos and emus and ostriches. 
[03:18:00]  Ostriches.  Wallabies.  Wallabies.  Sure, they're there.  You know what would be worse?  Even if you fall down there, somebody's going to drop a bottle of water down there.  It's going 80 feet.  It's going to hit, like, terminal velocity.  It's going to smash you in the head.  You know what these assholes do?  They'll pee on you, on their friends, when they're down there looking.  Oh, man.  No, it's raining.  It's raining.  Oh, we're funny.  Those Aussies are hilarious like that.  That's humor.  Good fun.  You've probably been to pretty much every country in the world. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  No.  I mean, six continents, 50 states, most of the major countries.  But, no, not all of them.  What about the dark continent?  I've been to the dark continent.  You've been there, yeah?  It was dark.  What did you have to do there?  We went to, let's see, Johannesburg, and then down to Cape Town for Shark Week back in  06.  Oh, right.  And then I went to the Western Desert to explore the Sands of the Dead, which is the largest  charted graveyard in human history, with Zahi Hawass to plunder tombs in search of golden 
[03:19:00]  masks.  Do you get bored at parties when people try to tell you a story?  When you're sitting on all of these stories, like, yeah, I was in Long Island the other  day.  Oh, Jesus.  Just trying to figure out which one you want to tell that night, because there's so many.  Do I go with the shark cage one, or the falling down the 80-foot hole and getting peed on?  I'm not feeling like telling that one today.  When in doubt, go with the getting peed.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, you've got to laugh.  So what about the desert?  So the desert, yeah, this was years ago for Discovery, but somebody, some goat farmer 
[03:19:30]  in the middle of nowhere stumbled across a hole which led into a grave, and being an enterprising  goat herder, he raided the tomb.  And opening the sarcophagi, he found the remains of whatever, but there was a golden mask where  the face would be.  And so this suggested some kind of royalty.  But nobody had any record of any royalty ever being in that part of the western desert.  And so they began to explore some more, found more tombs, more golden masks. 
[03:20:00]  So nobody knew what this was.  It didn't line up with anything we knew about Egypt in that part of the time or world.  And so I went over there with this archaeologist, and we did a thing called Egypt Week Live,  and basically just fancy talk for tomb raiding.  Now, does that guy get the goat herder he found it?  Does he get to keep it?  Maybe he's never been seen again.  I have no idea, actually.  Probably the curse.  Weren't you afraid of a curse? 
[03:20:30]  Boy, they got a lot of those curses over there.  I'm afraid of ringworm.  I'm afraid of whooping.  Well, what happened when you did the tomb raiding?  Well, what happened was we found hundreds of them.  Really?  And it was ultimately...  Belloc stole every one of them from him.  That's what happened.  Belloc.  Belloc's always there.  No, it was basically Beverly Hills.  What they found was this community was a community of very prosperous merchants,  and in relative terms, it would be like finding Beverly Hills 5,000 years from now, 
[03:21:00]  and digging up through Rodeo Drive and going, what the heck?  What was here?  Bunch of plastic bags.  They used to be tits.  That's a great mystery.  What are these things?  Somebody explain this.  It's crazy.  They're all over the place.  How far back to...  Found in pairs.  How far back do these people go?  Do they ever figure that out?  I don't know.  You know, I mean, honestly, it's...  I'm just sitting here listening to myself go on, and I don't ever want to be confused  with an expert. 
[03:21:30]  I mean, you could fill a book with what I don't know.  I know, like, I can get into a good story, but I don't know.  You really...  You're an expert in this.  Yeah.  Have you ever been in a shark cage?  Oh, yeah.  Now, how safe are those?  Because I went out to Nantucket for a vacation, and I absolutely terrified of the ocean and  sharks, and for some dumb reason...  You went in?  No.  The captain was talking me into going, it's totally safe, you know, blah, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah.  So, is it?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, look, a shark cage is fine.  Most people get hurt in cages, get hurt because they take their camera, and they put it outside 
[03:22:00]  the cage, you know, because they want to get a shot, but they don't want the bars in  the way.  Rather than using the zoom.  Yeah.  Because people aren't bright.  And then something, you know, something will come by and snag them.  You can say what?  That's how much people get hurt.  A shark?  Well, it's not necessarily a shark.  It could be anything.  But people...  Cages are dangerous because they create an illusion of complete safety, and then you become  really complacent, and that's where you get hurt.  I saw that footage where the shark got into the cage. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  With two guys in there.  The shark just rammed through.  They had taken one of the bars out to get a better view with the camera.  Shark, and it was a big one, probably a 13, 15 footer, slams into this opening in the  cage.  25.  He's 25.  25 at least.  And he was in the cage with these guys flailing.  Holy shit.  And the guy ducks down.  One of them realized, like, when his head turned the other way, he went through another hole  and got out and just left the other guy in there.  Yeah.  The other guy decided he would leave that cage. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, look, it's the old story being chased by a bear, right?  The guy says, you know how fast those bears run?  Doesn't matter, man.  I just got to run faster than you.  Faster than the last.  That's it.  Mike's got to go.  This sucks.  Ah, shit.  They're telling us you got to go.  Who's not us?  Gotti.  E-Rock said it.  Victoria Gotti is saying.  Huh?  Liam?  You probably have a lot of shows to do around here today.  Yeah, but this is my favorite.  You know what?  I don't know.  Yes, no in the shark cage.  Safe?  Safer than free diving with sharks.  Don't do that. 
[03:23:30]  I mean, that's just ill-advised.  Get in the cages.  It's harmless.  It's fun.  But if they ever offer to put you in the steel mesh suit, the shark suit.  No, I would never do that.  Well, I did that.  I got bit.  I got bit about 40 times.  One tooth got through.  There's still a hole in my freaking shin bone from it.  How do you top these stories?  I know you don't.  Well, here's how you top it.  Forget the sharks.  It's not the shark.  It's when you dive, and I'm a moderately experienced diver, but you've got an extra 50 pounds on you, which screws up everything.  You've got shark bouncing off your chest, which elevates your rate. 
[03:24:00]  I ran out of air at 65 feet on the test dive before Shark Week, and that was, to this day, the scariest thing that's happened to me on this stupid show.  What did you have to do?  Yeah, how long did it take for me to get your back up?  Well, what happened was, I had 40 minutes of air.  I burned through it in 29.  Wow.  Okay.  So you had to hold your breath for 11 minutes.  That's like bombing, blowing through your material.  Just underwater.  Yeah, you just did your closing bit. 
[03:24:30]  You're at 17.  Well, it was totally humiliating, but there was a reporter there named Leon for TV Guide, international writer, and he was right next to me.  And he looked at my gauge, and he was like, uh-oh, up we go.  And I was like, look, I'm never going to make it.  My last breath was an exhale.  And so I wasn't wearing a normal regulator.  He was, but I wasn't.  I had a full face mask on.  Oh, man.  So you can't.  And I had a bicycle helmet screwed into it, because a week earlier, Shark had bit somebody in the back of the head, so the insurance company made me wear this bicycle helmet. 
[03:25:00]  So he can't get my mask.  You can't share a regulator with the guy, because you've got a mask on your face.  Now, I'm also out of air, all right?  I got 40.  I'm dressed up like frickin' Ivanhoe, okay?  I'm dead weight.  This guy grabs me, floods his BC, and the two of us kick as hard as we can.  And we get to the surface.  It takes about 80 seconds.  Holy shit.  But again, my last breath is an exhale.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so I lost my peripheral vision. 
[03:25:30]  You started getting tunnel vision.  And I stopped caring, to tell you the truth.  Whoa.  Oh, that dopamine or something started coming.  Oh, man.  It was just like, you know, about 10 feet from the surface, I'm looking around going, all in all, you know, I had a pretty good run.  This is going to be, yeah.  My eulogy is going to be great.  They'll play clips.  That's how we feel every day as we walk out of this building.  We had a good run.  We had a pretty good run.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Wow, that's a great story.  Brutal.  That's fucked up.  I'm so sorry I was late today.  I got jacked up and got in the wrong damn car. 
[03:26:00]  Well, you come back soon, man.  We didn't really sell the new show, but it looks like it's going to be a good one.  Would you do it for me when I leave?  I'm telling you, it's great.  How Booze Built America premieres tomorrow at 10 p.m. on Discovery.  It sounds like a history show, but there's cross-dressing, there's bad language, juvenile humor, adult situations, and wall-to-wall drinking.  Your listeners are going to love it.  The Anthony show.  Perfect.  Yes.  Described our show, I think.  Thanks, fellas.  If you watch, I won't have to go in another hole for a while, which is the goal.  And Bill's with Caroline's this week, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, too, and Sunday. 
[03:26:30]  Wow, Jimmy.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  I'll tell you, if I wasn't there, I would go out to Columbus to go see Jim Norton.  Two shows Friday.  And three Saturday.  And three on Saturday.  And you'd have plenty of place to stretch out if you came to my show.  Put your feet up on two open seats in the front.  Funny ball.  Columbus this weekend.  It's going to be packed.  It's going to be packed.  All right, we're going home.  Mike, well, thank you, brother.  Thanks, fellas.  Always a pleasure.  All right, later.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, After ONA Live is next. 
[03:27:00]  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  The triumphant return of Mike Rowe to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Welcome to the show, everybody.  Mike Rowe reminding us all.  I'm very glad, by the way, that we started the Mike Rowe segment with Opie bringing up 
[03:27:30]  exactly what had happened last time.  The Victoria Gotti was in here and he disappeared.  Roland, you got Mike Rowe back on the show.  Yeah.  Congratulations on that.  No problem.  Victoria Gotti did.  I mean, you know, we don't want to mention a Gotti's name in a negative light, but she  did almost ruin it for us.  Oh, yeah, she did.  She did, right?  Yeah, totally.  It was funny that he started the segment by saying, well, it wasn't that she was discussing  her book.  It was a book reading.  She was just reading her book.  But he seemed like, you know, he had a good time in here again. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, he'll be back.  Back to old times.  He hasn't been in the building, though, has he?  No, he's been, they said the last time he left here for Victoria Gotti, until now, he's been  filming Dirty Jobs.  Okay, yeah.  It is crazy.  When he said that he does like 20 of those Ford commercials in a day, like, can you imagine  just pumping out that kind of content?  And 700, he said in 2006 and in 2007, Dirty Jobs was airing 700 times a year. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, when I was in Sweden, that's all I saw, was they replayed Dirty Jobs so many times.  That's almost twice a day, every day.  Yeah.  And some days there's not Dirty Jobs, we're going to have to catch up.  That's like USA and airing those Law and Order.  USA is the only network that will have a Law and Order SVU marathon on, and then it will  have a commercial for the SVU marathon that's on in two days.  Like, it's always, at least twice a week, there's an SVU marathon on USA. 
[03:29:00]  And I love the history of booze.  I watched it.  You did?  Yeah.  So it's a three-part miniseries.  Yeah.  That Mike Rowe was in here promoting.  It starts tomorrow at 10 p.m. Eastern time on the Discovery Channel, and it's basically  just the way booze has impacted the history of the United States.  Yeah, it's like, why can't I learn this history?  You loved it.  Yeah, I loved it.  It's something you could relate to.  I'm like, booze, yes.  And did it help you?  Did you start to say to yourself, well, maybe it's not so bad that I've started drinking 
[03:29:30]  again.  I mean, it's ingrained in our history.  Yeah, about whiskey, vodka, how it helped build Chicago and that.  Yeah.  Well, they said, yeah, I was reading the, you know, the press release, and it said stuff  about George Washington.  He used to, what, distill his own whiskey?  Yeah.  And Thomas Jefferson brewed his own beer.  It's delicious.  A rich, rich.  I think he did wine, too, Jefferson, like some rare wine.  Really?  Yeah.  Probably something sweet.  Yeah.  I mean, you knew who he was hanging out with. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, you know.  He was probably getting syrup and everything.  Somebody on the phones?  Oh, I just saw people walking around, Sal, and you know I worry.  What did, did you learn anything today, Sal?  How, by the way, I was listening back.  On Friday, you had a bit of a pep talk from world champion Judah Friedlander.  Yeah.  For whatever reason, I don't know why, and it was a surprise to me, people focused more  on the J.J. Abrams-Judah Friedlander interaction than the Sal-Judah Friedlander interaction.  That was a surprise to me. 
[03:30:30]  Was it?  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it was going to be more about Judah and Sal.  Turned out to be more Judah and J.J. Abrams.  Did you take any of that information that you were given?  Do you feel like you've learned?  Yeah, you know what I did now?  I keep my own log.  I keep a very detailed log of the show now.  Yeah?  Just so I can, you know, be very aware of everything that's going on.  Well, what did you learn today?  I learned that you can come in public in the subway.  That's a good one.  And you can rub up on women as well.  And as long as it's not violent, you're okay, actually. 
[03:31:00]  Way to go, Sal.  Way to start the week strong.  I know it's Tuesday, but I'm starting the week, so we're all starting the week.  It's all good, man.  Yesterday was everybody's practice day.  Today, now that I'm back, we start the week for real.  Absolutely, Sam.  That's a good way, though.  That was a good...  I missed you, too, buddy.  You did?  Yeah.  Thank you for saying that.  What about you, Roland?  Did you miss me?  You were gone?  Yes, I was, Roland.  I wasn't here yesterday.  Oh, yeah, I missed you, too.  John, you're on After Hoping Anthony Live.  Oh, we missed you, Sam.  Now we can get back to talking about Troy and the interns, because listening to Travis  and Danny's rip-off of Geek Time yesterday was painful. 
[03:31:30]  What happened?  Oh, no, I do enjoy the geeky stuff myself, but they were just talking about artists, comic  book artists, or video game artists.  Boasters?  Yeah, and I'd rather just...  Danny, did you turn the show into poster talk yesterday?  It's always poster talk with Danny Ross.  Fuck this guy, man.  He's pissed.  I talked about a book for the last five minutes of the show yesterday.  It wasn't like the whole show was just about the... 
[03:32:00]  So you brought up a comic book, and he immediately was like...  No, not even a...  No, no, just an artist who I enjoy, and he's got a book coming out, and I mentioned it.  Yeah, and that was it?  Yeah, pretty much.  It was about four minutes' worth.  John, you can't put up with four minutes' worth?  No, I'd rather...  I'd love when Danny and Travis talk about shit like that.  I enjoy it thoroughly, but I'd rather listen about Troy's delicious cock instead.  I can't even tell if he's being sarcastic.  I gotta hang up.  I can't hang up on people, Eric.  Is that the worst, when you don't even know...  Like, that guy called in...  Oh, there it goes.  I fixed it.  He called in trying for something, and then you don't even know what he's trying for. 
[03:32:30]  Well, he wasn't being committal.  Like, he wanted to bash you, but he didn't want you to be mad at him.  So he's like, well, I mean, I like it, but I like...  I heard it in the back.  I think he thought I wasn't just gonna come down the hall probably.  Yeah.  Like, you gotta...  If you wanna bash Danny, go ahead, but you gotta be able to bash him.  Like, when he's like, hey, fuck you.  You can't be like, no, no, I like your stuff.  It's...  Well, what are you calling for?  What do you have to contribute, then, really?  Did you learn anything today, Danny Ross?  You must have been happy to have Mike Rowe back, because you're a big Discovery guy.  Yeah, I mean, look, it's been a while since he's been on the air, and it was very nice. 
[03:33:00]  I honestly thought we'd never have him back.  He was pissed.  I think he was pissed.  He was definitely pissed.  He was pissed, right, Roland?  A thousand percent pissed.  He was.  He was pissed.  Dude, I remember when he was here with that whole Victoria Gotti situation.  Right.  I was...  And I remember being in the booth with the window, just looking through the glass, and  he's just playing, like, he was, like, twirling the headphone cord.  Yeah.  And you could just see it in his face, like, holy shit.  He does...  He wants to leave so bad, but doesn't know how.  Because, like, Mike Rowe's a guy, we were talking about it today, who's got just stories 
[03:33:30]  upon stories, and he just wants to come, hang out, and tell his stories of crazy shit  that's happened to him.  And when you have Victoria Gotti in here that's kind of, like, probably telling half-truths  about her life in, you know, connected to the mob or whatever, it's not entertaining  for him.  Especially when he thought he was going to be a guest on the, uh...  Well, yeah, I don't think anybody wants to, like, be under the impression that it's,  you know, it's their time, and then here comes somebody else to fucking eat up your time.  And he was...  How long was Victoria Gotti in that day?  Do you remember, Roland? 
[03:34:00]  Do you remember?  Dude.  I just remember he waited an hour and a half before he got on to something.  He waited before coming on the show for an hour and a half?  Yeah, that was before I was here.  Yeah, that was the...  Oh, before you got hired.  Did that blue label save the day?  Do you know?  Oh, oh, oh, the booze was sent.  Well, that was the, um, he was like, because he came in early, then it was delayed.  It wasn't because...  It was a series of events that led him, like, it was like a bunch of stuff that he was kind  of...  I know some of the words you said. 
[03:34:30]  What's up, Eric?  Some of the things that happened irked him.  What's up, Eric?  Uh, Victoria Gotti was on the air with us.  It was an hour, right?  It was for an hour.  That was September 30th, 2009.  So it was two years.  And it was an hour?  Uh, she was on for an hour.  Oh, God.  And Mike Rowe probably had like 15 minutes before she stopped by.  Yeah, it was something like that.  It wasn't very long.  He was on for about 20 minutes, then she walked in.  Oh, and so this was before you were here, Rowan.  So you don't know if he left in a huff or not.  Yeah, well, I got a call that day because he thought I was still with him. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, from the K-Rock days?  Yeah.  Because you were with us when we were at K-Rock.  Yeah.  And then when we got here, you were not with us.  Correct.  And they hired you probably, what, a year or two into us being here?  A year and a half ago.  A year and a half.  Oh, you've only been here a year and a half?  Yeah, that's it.  You've made quite an impact for yourself, young Rowan.  Yeah, so then when Mike called me, he goes, Rowan, it's Mike Rowe.  I was like, hey, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  You just thought you were just calling to talk.  Yeah, I'm like, oh.  All right.  He goes, ah.  He goes, well, I'm not doing too well. 
[03:35:30]  I'm like, what's wrong?  And he had that, and he had that, hey, it's Mike Rowe.  Yeah, and he goes, I love you.  I love the guys.  But when I came in there, I'm like, ah.  Then everything started leading to what happened.  I'm like, okay, I got you.  You just skipped the interesting part of the story.  Like, you just told the details leading up to it.  It's like you gave us this.  You were like, hey, who wants a BLT?  I do.  Great.  Here's some bread with lettuce and tomato on it.  I call it my Nagel Vigories.  Yeah, you gave me a BLT hold of bacon.  It's a Nagelry.  Nagelry.  Nagelry.  Yeah, but now he's back. 
[03:36:00]  He's happy, so.  He is, and he had a great appearance on the show.  I think everybody's happy, but I was glad that we finally addressed it.  We should have made him shut up so we could talk to Bill Burr.  Yeah.  Bill.  Seriously, Sandra Bullock.  I know we talked about this before, but tell me the truth.  So breaking bad.  You've been doing so well.  Yeah.  Did you learn anything today, Eric?  Eric, I learned that calls to Mike Francesa are not going to stop anytime soon.  How funny is that Mike Francesa thing?  I learned that even if you have a radio show slash TV show, like if you turn your radio show 
[03:36:30]  into a TV show, as was the case with Mike Francesa, it's appropriate, I guess, to pretend  it's just a radio show to not acknowledge that you're also on television.  Mike Francesa, we talked about it in the first hour.  You got to listen to the replay if you didn't hear it.  You know, we talked about it like a week or two ago.  He fell asleep on the air while he was interviewing somebody.  And his show, Mike Francesa is a sports guy in New York.  He's very famous.  Mike and the Mad Dog.  That's him.  And his show is aired on television. 
[03:37:00]  So it's always, it's all over YouTube and everything, but he was interviewing a guy on the phone  and he shut his eyes and you could plainly tell he was sleeping because minutes, literally  minutes after, uh, this happened, he just springs up like somebody, obvious producer  or something, uh, talked in his headphones and his eyes started up and he put on the  mute button and said something like, uh, what happened?  Where am I?  Like he had no idea what was going on.  So then he goes on the air and says he wasn't sleeping. 
[03:37:30]  He just shut his eyes and apologizes.  Now the latest search amount on YouTube.  I think they're on our Facebook page.  Yeah.  Both, uh, the sleeping clip and the fans calling are up on our Facebook.  You got it.  These fans calling, they drive him crazy too.  Cause he doesn't have a sense of humor about himself.  He's a typical sports guy jock that feels like he feels secure talking about jock stuff  and he feels insecure when there's humor added to it because he's not a funny guy, but  he has that alpha male thing in him where he wants to be a winner all the time. 
[03:38:00]  He never wants somebody getting the better of him, which is, you know, the quintessential  I'm not funny quality to have.  So people are just calling him now with references to falling asleep, uh, pretending they're asleep.  It's hilarious.  Uh, you got to check them out, but you never worked with Mike Frances or anything like that,  Eric.  Nope.  Just Scott and Todd?  Uh, yeah.  The whole Mike Frances, oh, do we have, by the way, speaking of that, can you see if  you can find for me, Eric?  I just had this thought while I was talking.  Anthony once fell asleep on the air. 
[03:38:30]  We had the video.  If you do it like a Google search, you can find it somewhere.  It's not on YouTube, but it's on one of those other video websites that was around for a  minute.  Um, Anthony fell asleep on the air and I wanted to know if you could find like the first few  minutes of us setting it up and, uh, Opie realized, or Opie Jim or whoever it was, realizing he's  asleep.  I'm trying to remember.  We had some internet guy on the show too.  One of those sites that we-  Maybe the guy from FARC or something?  Yeah, that's the guy.  Okay.  I mean, I don't know for sure, but I just, I know it was five years ago is what we realized 
[03:39:00]  today.  But Anthony passed out in the middle of the show and this was when we were in, this is  a beauty of satellite radio, by the way.  We can do stuff like this, but this is when we were over at 57th Street.  We had our own studio and everything, so we could leave him alone.  He fell asleep and we put music on and just left.  Opie, Anthony, Jim, everybody just left the studio and they did it very quietly and they  put very soothing music on just so he could kind of, you know, have pleasant dreams and 
[03:39:30]  everything.  And I was hiding in the studio behind a chair as to not, as to be very inconspicuous with  the video camera just shooting over the back of the chair.  And he was sleeping for 25 minutes by himself.  25 minutes.  He was just in snooze land.  And you could tell in the video when he wakes up that he doesn't know where the fuck he  is.  He's kind of pissed, but he's also like cranky because he's just waking up and he's very 
[03:40:00]  confused as anyone would be because he thinks he's just shut his eyes for a second and he's  been out for a half an hour and the studio is empty.  Like when the last memory he has, he was in the middle of a national radio show.  And now he's just after an E.A.  He was in the middle of a national radio show with a guest.  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  And you remember having to tell the guest, ah, he falls asleep.  Like, what do you do?  Like, you just go, oh, this is one of Anthony's things.  He falls asleep sometimes.  No, I told him, I go, I think I told him like he had a turkey sandwich and that turkey 
[03:40:30]  kind of put him to sleep because he was eating some medicine.  You blamed it on tryptophan.  Tryptophan and the medication.  He said, so your excuse, your brilliant talent booker got to think on my feet excuse is his  medication reacted poorly with the tryptophan in his turkey sandwich.  And what did the guest say?  He goes, oh man, he should watch it.  Be careful.  I go, I know.  Do we have confirmation on who the guest was, Eric?  Um, it was Drew, uh, Drew Curtis?  It was the guy from Farfark.  But also Francine and Rick Shapiro. 
[03:41:00]  The studio was full of people.  Do you have the clip?  I'm going, it's a long thing.  I'm just jumping through it.  Okay, you scroll through it.  I mean, when you're there, you're like, all right, whatever.  Debbie, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hi, Sam.  Hi, Debbie.  Glad you're back.  Oh, thank you.  What did, did you learn anything today?  Well, you know, I did just tune in on XM.  Um, but I did want to say something from yesterday's show with Danny.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, I'm sorry. 
[03:41:30]  But he's looking for a dog.  And he mentioned a fish left.  And I've had one for 12 and a half years.  And it's the best dog they'll ever have.  Dogs?  What's going on?  What are you talking about, dogs?  Is this what, he talked about comic books and dogs yesterday?  Well, Danny mentioned getting a dog.  Oh.  And I think he's been looking for a rescue.  Am I wrong?  I don't know.  I didn't listen.  I was asleep.  That's why I wasn't here.  Well, you're a smart man.  Well, Debbie.  Anyway, I just wanted to let him know that these ones are wonderful dogs. 
[03:42:00]  I had one for 12 and a half years.  She was great.  All right.  Well, thanks, Debbie.  Okay.  Bye, Sam.  Bye, Debbie.  No rescue for me, brand new.  What do you mean?  A brand new dog.  You have a dog?  No, I wouldn't have a dog.  Oh, I was about to say, Roland, you can't take care of yourself.  Is he in between two slices of bread when you bought him?  Is that what happened?  No.  Oh, well, yeah.  Eric, while Eric is looking for that clip, the Francesa talk reminded me.  Oh, I'm just getting a text here.  Oh. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, there's a new video up on Opie Radio.  I haven't seen it yet.  It's a video of birds eating.  What?  That doesn't sell it properly.  Can you see?  So, dogs and birds eating.  Yeah.  What is this?  The Nature Hour?  Can you see if you can find it on Opie's YouTube channel?  Any, Roland?  If you jump on the computer or something?  Yeah, what it reminded me of, all the talk of Francesa, and I've been getting...  I'm going to turn off that mic because your fingers are just thudding on the keyboard.  You have...  Yeah, you go in, Sal. 
[03:43:00]  Roland doesn't know what he's doing.  Did you hear?  Just the sound of Roland's fingers hitting the keys reminds me that somebody...  I got a puppet head.  You're going to do it, Roland?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, just go to his, uh...  Go to his page.  Click the thing that says Opie Radio.  Oh, Roland.  You're worse than me.  That's not the right video.  I said birds eating.  Oh, I don't know what that is.  I got to see this.  I want to see if it's, uh...  Okay.  No, that's...  That's his channel.  All right.  Scroll down a little bit then. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, there it is.  Birds attack.  Now, this...  Oh, yeah, real hard.  Seems more like it.  Oh, there's ads.  Of course, Opie has to make it commercial.  I remember before Opie had ads.  Before he sold out.  Oh, what's this?  Opie's in his YouTube video.  Who's filming it?  Oh, my God.  It's a girl.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  That's disgusting.  They're trying to burn food. 
[03:44:00]  Opie's got a bunch of birds around him  eating off his face.  That's gross.  You know how, like...  You know how disgusting birds' feet are?  I would hate to do that.  I don't want birds touching me.  And who's filming that?  They're eating off his face.  Me?  That's gross.  Oh, now you're just pulling up.  But, yeah, that's up now on YouTube.com  slash Opie Radio.  Birds eating off Opie's face.  Why doesn't Opie talk about this stuff on the show?  I want to hear about that.  Where is that at, though? 
[03:44:30]  Huh?  Is it Central Park?  I don't know.  I want to find out what happened.  Hopefully we'll find out tomorrow.  But I'm getting a lot of tweets.  And the Francesca thing reminded me.  Assuming...  Now, they mentioned their contract on the show today.  And I keep getting asked...  The number one question when I meet anybody  who listens to the One Show  is about the contracts.  I hope that they're getting renewed  because I would like to broadcast as well.  I would assume they are  because they don't seem to be in a bad mood. 
[03:45:00]  But Opie mentioned again today  there's something like eight days left.  So the short answer is I don't know.  But the long answer is  I really, really hope so  because I'd like to continue getting a paycheck.  However,  assuming  that everything goes according to plan.  Assuming  the dotted lines get signed.  As I am assuming.  Because I have to think positively  as you all should as well.  Somebody stopped me on the West Side Highway.  I was driving...  I was at a red light on the West Side Highway. 
[03:45:30]  And the guy next to me  had me roll down my window.  I thought he wanted directions.  And he actually asked me  about Opie and Anthony's contract.  I'm not their agent.  I don't know.  And these are odd spots for you to be asking me.  But  we're all just thinking positively.  I think it's going to happen.  And that's why, yes,  it's time to start prepping for Jocktober.  Jocktober,  everybody's favorite time of year,  is coming again.  I don't know what form it's going to take this year.  It kind of goes crazy sometimes.  Roland, you're looking at me like 
[03:46:00]  timidly,  a little bit scared.  No, I have a few suggestions.  You do?  Yeah.  But you want to give them to me privately.  Yeah.  Okay.  Twitter me at  Twitter.com slash NotSam  with all your Jocktober suggestions  starting immediately.  Last year,  Jocktober is, of course,  everybody's favorite time of year  on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's where we take  shows,  random radio shows  across the country.  Because let's face it,  and it's only been worse,  it's only gotten worse  since we started. 
[03:46:30]  I think this,  this will either be the 4th  or the 5th annual Jocktober.  And it's only gotten worse  since we started  for terrestrial radio.  But it has completely  deteriorated  into  basura.  Garbage.  Nothing.  There is nothing going on  on terrestrial radio.  And it's amazing  that all these shows  even exist anymore.  I'm surprised that  any terrestrial radio station  has enough money left  to pay  people to talk on them.  That they're not just  all iPods  on shuffle.  I don't know  who listens to it, 
[03:47:00]  except  during the month of October.  Because that's when  I listen to it.  What we do is  we find random,  and they are truly random,  random stations  throughout the country.  And I just find,  you know,  top 40,  adult contemporary,  whatever format it is.  And I find the morning shows,  and I listen to them,  and I pull clips  from one show.  It's not like a crazy  best of,  and it's not edited  out of context  to make it seem worse  than it actually is.  I just pull clips  from a show,  and I bring them 
[03:47:30]  to this show,  and we,  we terribly,  and mercilessly,  make fun of,  and bash,  whatever local DJ  we're talking about.  Whatever town you're from,  you could easily,  I'm sure that you all,  and that's what's great  about satellite radio,  is across the country,  I'm sure that all of you  know some terrible  radio station.  Even if it's already  been featured on Jocktober.  Now, as I said,  I don't know what form  Jocktober is going to  take this year.  Last year,  we added a whole new element 
[03:48:00]  in the Facebook attacks.  We didn't see it happening.  We didn't see,  I mean, we saw it happening,  we didn't see it coming.  Fans of the show,  just all of a sudden,  started, uh,  leaving messages  that were horrible,  that were horrendous.  Just the,  the most disgusting  and vile  photos,  comments,  videos that you could  possibly think of  started being left  randomly  on the Facebook pages  of these shows  that we were talking about.  And the attacks would last 
[03:48:30]  for 24 hours,  unsolicited,  and in most cases  unwarranted,  but definitely unsolicited  by us.  It was always  a pleasant surprise  when we got to see  their Facebook page  was just,  terrible things  were happening to it.  And what would happen  is the page would be  attacked for 24 hours  or until they  shut the page down.  And almost none  of those attacks  went a full 24 hours.  They all shut the page  down by the time  the after show was on.  That was just  what was happening.  I'm sure that's  going to come back 
[03:49:00]  because I know you,  you pests,  as you're called,  you Open Anthony listeners  love to stay interactive.  But that's the first thing  that came into my mind  when we were talking  about Mike Francesa today.  What a prelude  all of this is  to Jocktober.  And it's a lot of work  and it's a lot of bad radio  for me to listen to.  But at the end of the day,  it's worth it.  You know what I mean?  And that's what we do  it all for.  Dave, you're on  After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, Sam.  How are you, man?  I'm good. 
[03:49:30]  How are you?  Pretty good.  Hey, listen.  I want to make  one request to you  and it's this year's  Jocktober.  Make sure whatever  shows you pick  that their Facebook pages  are accessible  that most listeners  can post on them.  You love it.  You love it.  Because you love  you listeners,  you're a very hands-on group.  I was a tyrant last year  and I was the days  that we weren't able  to post on it.  I was all town.  So what was  your most proud moment  during last year's  Jocktober, Dave? 
[03:50:00]  I think it was  the one when  the Idaho show  when I posted  the picture  of the creepy guy  with the kitty butt.  That was pretty funny.  Oh, jeez.  And you know what?  Jocktober last year,  thank you, Dave,  is what brought us,  it brought me to tears,  the Hulk Hogan  9-11 photos.  And those have been  around forever.  I guess I just  never seen them  and it really tickled  me that day  when we first found out  that Hulk Hogan  was responsible  for 9-11.  Now, Roland,  you enjoy Jocktober  secretly?  I love Jocktober. 
[03:50:30]  Now, why?  Do you have experience  with these shows  or you just like  seeing you  just tear them down?  You just like  seeing people get  insulted.  You're a bully.  I'm a bully.  A little bit.  No.  A radio bully.  No.  But you like  seeing radio shows  get torn apart.  Yeah.  Yeah, you enjoy that.  Like Scott and Todd  and those guys.  Yeah, well Scott and Todd  is a no-brainer.  What'd you say?  No, he attacked them  and then they post pictures.  It just makes you laugh.  You love it.  Every day is like  a new adventure.  It's a good time.  Every day is like Christmas. 
[03:51:00]  Eric, you found the...  I just need when  they first realize  he's asleep.  This went on for a while  so I'm just scoping it down  so we can get  maybe three, four minutes of it.  Oh, okay.  Well, what do you got  for me now?  It's almost done.  Oh, okay.  Then we'll wait.  We'll wait.  Because I also want  to find out from Eric  if getting topical  is really over.  Was he quick?  Well, I don't know.  The last several shows  he's just been coming back  with regular rejoiners.  Getting topical  is, of course, 
[03:51:30]  Eric's marquee  non-virus bit.  And by non-virus  I'm, of course,  referring to  not the old station name  but his wonderful character.  Getting topical,  remember he used to play  like a song  that had to do  with usually  overly obvious  something going on  that it's the anniversary of?  Yeah, or birthday of.  Now he's just playing  random rejoiners  during the second break.  Wow.  I don't know  what's going on.  I don't know  if he's decided to go  because last time  he said he quit something,  Eric.  He didn't quit. 
[03:52:00]  He didn't.  That was the internship program.  Will the virus come back?  I mean, I think  if we asked for him  to come back  he absolutely would.  I don't know.  We'll talk to David, though.  David, you're on  after Opie Anthony Live.  Same.  Sounds like  a million bucks, brother.  Thank you, David.  Hey, I got a suggestion  for a show  that I wish  you guys would obliterate.  Oh, what's that?  I'll write it down.  Lex and Terry show.  I'm sure you've heard of it.  I've heard of it.  Have we done Lex and Terry before?  Did you have?  Do them again. 
[03:52:30]  Eric, have we done Lex and Terry?  I don't know  if we did Lex and Terry.  You know, I couldn't...  I don't know...  Thank you, David.  I don't know how  in the spirit of Jocktober...  It's a very risky thing  with Jocktober.  I learned  that even if a show is shitty,  if the hosts of the show  are fans of Opie and Anthony  and call up the show,  Jocktober will turn around  and destroy me  instead of them.  And it's risky...  Was it one of Opie's friend? 
[03:53:00]  Oh, that was last year.  Yeah.  I was going to say  it's risky to pick a show  that's not the stereotypical  male-female dynamic.  That's most of them.  But last year,  that was maybe  my favorite moment  of Jocktober  when we started...  We started playing clips  of the show  and it was just...  I swear to God,  I had no idea.  It was this random show  that I had found.  I don't even remember  what city it's in.  Because the way I find  half of these shows  is I'll just type in, like,  Top 40 Radio Peoria. 
[03:53:30]  And then the station comes up  and then I listen to it  and then I pull clips  and we make fun of them  because they're guaranteed  to be awful.  But what happened was  we were making fun  of this show  and Opie was making fun  of this show  and halfway through the clips  I started pulling pictures up  on the internet  and Opie realized  that he had thought  the voice sounded familiar  and it was a guy  that he had started  in college radio with.  So obviously this guy  knows who Opie is.  Yeah.  And he's going...  And now he's getting messages 
[03:54:00]  from the guy he started  in college radio with,  his fans,  talking about how shitty he is.  As if he didn't feel  shitty enough  that Opie became, like,  a giant in radio  and this guy is still stuck  in Podunk Town  doing God knows what.  Now he's got Opie's fans  emailing him  and telling him,  you suck.  You're the worst.  You have AIDS.  No, I don't have AIDS.  Yes, you do have AIDS.  Let's see.  Kevin.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy? 
[03:54:30]  Morning, Roland.  Morning.  I have a great,  great show for you too,  Jocktober.  The last time I listened  to FM Radio,  there's a show called  Rula and Ryan.  Lou and Ryan or Lua?  Rula.  Rula.  She's a big, fat pig.  R-U-L-A?  R-U-L-A, Christy.  Yeah, her last name's  Christy too.  But it's 104 KRBE  and it is...  I just get douche chills  thinking about it.  In what city?  Houston. 
[03:55:00]  Houston.  All right, well,  we'll see if we get to it.  Thank you, Kevin.  All right, buddy.  Hey, Luke in Massachusetts.  Hey, what's up?  I have a suggestion  for you, Jocktober.  Uh-huh.  I think maybe  you should look into  the Danny and Travis  Pets and Posters  hour that aired yesterday.  I mean, you know,  you could really do  some stuff with that,  I'm telling you.  It was?  It was Pets and Posters?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The whole hour, man.  Well, that doesn't seem  like it's what should  have been done. 
[03:55:30]  I don't understand  that at all.  All right, I gotta get  going today.  I can't talk to you  later, Luke,  before either of them  have a chance to run  up the hall.  I don't know why  you do a show  about pets and posters.  It's after  Obi and Anthony live.  You have that clip, Eric?  Yeah, I have it  in three parts.  Three parts?  Well, because it was long.  When he was just sleeping.  Yeah, but it went on.  You'll be amazed  how long he was sleeping  for when they left.  Do you want it  where they discovered  he fell asleep?  Yeah.  Where he was sleeping  or when he wakes up? 
[03:56:00]  Do you?  I mean, I don't need  to hear when he was  sleeping, right?  Okay.  Yeah, just give me  where they discovered.  This is when Anthony,  we were talking about  Mike Francesa earlier  on the show.  This is when Anthony  of the Obi and Anthony  show fell asleep  in the middle  of the Obi and Anthony  show.  We lost Anthony  and everyone's just  having a casual conversation.  I feel nauseous, too.  I feel like I'm going  to puke since we sat.  When I eat too much fruit  mixed with coffee, 
[03:56:30]  it does something  in my stomach.  Anthony's out cold  and we're continuing  to radio.  All right.  We should all  journal out of him.  We should just leave him  and he'll wake up.  Just keep the channel  live with him sleeping.  There you go.  You just lower the shades.  I blame you, Drew.  You put him to sleep.  I know.  Bill O'Reilly found out  that the two otters  were gay  on YouTube. 
[03:57:00]  I'm just amazed  he's out cold.  Yeah.  I thought he was faking,  but no.  No, no.  No.  He does.  Narcolepsy strikes.  Hold on.  Of course, Drew's book  about FARC.  So, you know.  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Can you hear me?  We're all leaving the studio. 
[03:57:30]  We're going to put on  some easy listening music  and sometime between now  and when Ron and Fez are on  at noon,  Anthony will wake up  from his nap.  Have a good day.  And that was it?  That's for when they left.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear Drew  from FARC  like awkward laughing?  He was like,  oh, I was hoping  I'd still get a chance  to be funny and hang out  and they're like,  no, we're ending  the show right now.  I forgot we were playing  also while he was sleeping. 
[03:58:00]  We played,  Steve was making  sweepers that let you know  how long he's been sleeping.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Do you have one of those?  Yeah.  One of them's right here.  You're listening  to the soothing sounds  of the Opie and Anthony show.  Anthony has been asleep  for 15 minutes.  If you listen closely,  you'll hear him wake up  very gently  and realize the microphone  is still on  and the studio is empty.  Enjoy.  Look,  that's high production value.  Yeah. 
[03:58:30]  And we had that like  every what,  five minutes?  Every three minutes.  Every three minutes.  Yeah.  And so Steve was just  pumping out production.  Yeah.  Like he'd just run into the booth  and get those done real quick  and have them ready  every three minutes.  Why didn't he just  take the mic live?  I don't know.  That is high production value.  We don't have stuff like that  going on in this show anymore.  What happened?  We had Troy.  I guess we got Troy.  And I guess we haven't had  a moment where Anthony's  been asleep for,  how long was the final tally,  Eric?  Do you remember?  Of him sleeping?  Yeah.  Or is that,  uh, 
[03:59:00]  between that and 15 minutes,  it had to be  about 20 minutes.  Oh,  from where they figured it out  to when he actually  woke up.  Let's play,  uh,  when he wakes up.  All right.  This is Anthony sleeping  on the show.  Hang on.  Okay.  I don't want to rush you.  I don't want to pressure you.  Here we go.  I should have known.  Sam.  Yeah.  To the hyenas.  Yeah, 
[03:59:30]  I thought they were.  I saw.  Hi,  how are you doing?  Yeah.  I knew from the music.  Why else?  I'm sleepy.  Leave me alone.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  I don't want to.  Uh-oh. 
[04:00:00]  Great.  You're shitting me, right?  Line of the day.  I should have went to sleep  when Danny left.  I was up too late.  I made it in, 
[04:00:30]  but I couldn't make it  to the finish line.  All right.  Well,  he's just getting,  uh,  he's so groggy.  Groggy disoriented.  I mean,  keep in mind,  don't think about it  like you doze off  for five minutes,  like one of those things  and you wake up surprised.  Think about it  like you stayed up all night  and then you just slept  for 40 minutes  and your body hates you  because it wants  to keep sleeping so badly.  You stayed up all night  and your body  is just so mad at you  for waking up  and you cannot 
[04:01:00]  gain your bearings back.  We've all been there.  Just most of us  aren't on a national radio show  when it happens to us.  Poor Anthony.  I can't believe  that was five years.  Is that right, Eric?  Five years ago?  Yeah,  2007.  8,  9,  10,  11,  12.  Five years ago.  Well,  that's happened since then  and Anthony  has not fallen asleep  since then.  Something that Mike Francesa  cannot say.  Small studio.  Back then,  you could stretch  a little bit out more  and everything.  That's true.  You had a little more room  to stretch. 
[04:01:30]  Put your feet up.  Plus,  it was a very intimate studio  in the sense that  it was bigger than this one  but there was nobody  around us.  It was our own space.  Like here,  you can't fall asleep  on the air  because the curtains  are always open  and there's always  like management  or something  walking around  so you feel uneasy.  You don't want  management to catch you  sleeping  but over there  but over there  it was like  we're just hanging out.  It's only us.  You know,  it's only a matter of time.  I've been thinking about it  since they simulcast  on TV  plus do radio. 
[04:02:00]  They'll have a setup.  Who are you talking about?  Mike Francesa.  Okay.  Where all the mics  are recorded individually  and you didn't hear it  on the air  because the guest  was talking  but I bet you  they have his mic  isolated  where he's like  grumbling  and snoring  and whatever.  Oh,  that's funny.  That would be great.  I don't know if we could get that.  Yeah, of course  if we could get that.  It'd be awesome.  I mean,  we leave our mics running.  You'd think,  I'm sure he does  for production elements  or whatever.  You tell me this, Eric.  Is getting topical  with the sex done? 
[04:02:30]  Sex is getting topical.  The sexy boy toys  getting topical  Nagel time hour.  Is it finished?  If they want it back,  I guess we can bring it back.  You kind of took it  upon yourself  to stop doing it.  Well,  when Ope wasn't around  it was just  it was pretty much  yeah,  we're not doing this  for when Anthony  and Jim  or a comedian  or whoever  was filling in.  So it just got to the point  where I was like,  eh,  you know,  don't need to interrupt  what they're doing  with this.  I'll just kind of lay off. 
[04:03:00]  Are you going to bring it  back tomorrow?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Because I was talking to Roland  when you were cutting the clip up.  I was wondering  if you quit this  because the last time  you quit something  you didn't really quit it.  But tomorrow  is a busy guest day.  What's going on tomorrow?  So Eric,  you don't officially quit.  I just haven't done it.  Okay.  What's going on tomorrow,  Roland?  A lot of guests.  Yeah,  we'll guess.  Who?  We got to tease.  Oh, um.  We got to get the audience  excited, Roland. 
[04:03:30]  Damien,  how do you say his last name?  That's why you didn't  want to tell me.  I knew it  because you couldn't  pronounce his name  you son of a bitch.  You think I'm going to  let you get away with that?  Yeah.  You can tell.  When Roland brings something up  but then he won't mention  by name  and you think,  oh,  it must be sensitive information.  But 98% of the time  it's because he can't  pronounce the name.  Bonaduce?  Yeah,  that's why you'd never  let him slide.  Who's coming in tomorrow,  Roland?  Damien from the West Memphis 3.  Damien from the West Memphis 3?  Yeah.  Damien from the West Memphis 3.  Is it Eccles? 
[04:04:00]  Or E?  Is it Eccles?  What do you think?  Eccles?  I don't know.  Yeah,  Damien Eccles.  You got it right,  actually.  Yeah,  it was it.  From the West Memphis 3.  That's huge.  Yeah.  He's got his book out  so he's going to be promoting that.  We had Jason Baldwin  in here  right after they got released  and now Damien's  finally got his book finished  and he's going to be  Penny Marshall.  Penny Marshall's in tomorrow?  Yeah,  and Carl Urban.  Who's Carl Urban?  Dread,  Star Trek.  Star Trek? 
[04:04:30]  Star Trek?  Was he in Star Trek  or will he be in Star Trek?  No,  he's in his bones.  He was already in it?  Yeah.  Oh,  he was in the first one?  Yeah,  he was in the bones.  Okay,  well then that's something.  And he's in Lord of the Rings.  He was in Lord of the Rings?  The blonde,  yeah.  As an extra?  No,  you're thinking of Orlando Bloom.  No,  he's in Lord of the Rings.  He is?  Yeah.  Alright,  so Carl Urban,  and I guess he's promoting Dread.  He's the new judge,  Dread.  Yeah.  So Carl Urban,  Penny Marshall,  and Damien Eccles all tomorrow?  Yeah.  I mean,  why don't you just tell  Hopey and Anthony to stay home?  We got it covered. 
[04:05:00]  That's the interview.  Just,  well no,  you do the Roland interview.  Because they will.  We bring,  yeah,  you're right.  Thank you,  Eric.  No,  we'll do a Roland interview  and we'll bring everybody in  at the same time  and then we'll just have Anthony go,  eh,  eh,  talk amongst yourselves.  Yeah,  they don't like that.  You remember when the original MTV VJs  were in here and that's what you did?  Yes,  it sucked.  You're not good on your feet  with people who you don't know.  Well,  I'm not an interviewer.  No.  I just bring them to you.  Right,  you just bring them in.  But that was the day you were  missing the show,  so.  Yeah, 
[04:05:30]  they're still upset.  Keep it together.  We'll listen.  Stay tuned.  The best of Ron and Fez  is coming up next.  Ooh.  And we'll be back with more of this  when?  Tomorrow.  That's correct, Roland.  You got it right.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show  is now over.  For real this time.
