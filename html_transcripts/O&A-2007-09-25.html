<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast began with a discussion of the show's evolution, from using fax machines for song requests to implementing email and a dedicated system for instant feedback.  Anthony then launched into a furious rant about his horrendous commute, blaming the UN General Assembly, inconsiderate carpool lane users, truckers with unsecured loads (resulting in rocks hitting his windshield), and cab drivers in bus lanes.  His rant was punctuated with copious expletives and violent fantasies directed at offending drivers.  The hosts then transitioned to discussing a giant swastika carved into a New Jersey cornfield, Bill O'Reilly's perceived insensitive comments about a Black-owned restaurant (Sylvia's in Harlem), and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Holocaust-denying speech at Columbia University.  Kevin Smith was a guest earlier in the day.  The show incorporated their regular "80s New Wave Tuesday" segment and featured discussion of Anthony's latest video, a follow-up to his "Vista video" where he shot his computer. Anthony also shared a graphic account of a late-night sexual encounter that left him exhausted.  Offensive language was pervasive throughout this initial segment.

The next segment focused on a humorous clip of an Iranian leader denying the existence of homosexuals, which the hosts repeatedly replayed and mocked using derogatory language.  This was followed by a continued critique of Bill O'Reilly's experience at Sylvia's, with the hosts using racial slurs and offensive stereotypes to satirize O'Reilly's perceived racism and condescending tone. They also shared a personal anecdote about an unsettling experience during a Harlem photoshoot. Dane Cook appeared as a guest, discussing his busy film schedule, a disastrous audition tape, and anecdotes about Bob Kelly and other celebrities.  The hosts briefly mentioned a caller from Egypt ("Far Away Phone Call Tuesday") and other recurring segments like "80s New Wave Tuesday".

A subsequent segment featured another call from Dane Cook, promoting his movie "Good Luck Chuck."  This transitioned into a discussion of a purported Meg White sex tape, with the hosts and co-host Jimmy analyzing stills, debating authenticity, and commenting extensively on the woman's physique. After a break, a "Rock Scream" call from Keith in Massachusetts led back to the sex tape discussion. Opie then detailed a recent unsatisfactory sexual experience, blaming excessive pornography consumption, leading to a discussion about masturbation frequency and the challenges of maintaining intimacy.  Numerous listener calls followed, covering listener sexual experiences, a planned "best ass" contest, and the hosts' frustrations with their CBS lawyers. The segment concluded with discussion of Nikki Sixx's upcoming guest appearance, along with playing audio clips from the show's archives, including "Rusty Trombone" songs and a segment about a "pipe."  A call with Ron Bennington followed, discussing feelings towards Jay Moore and Bennington's celebrity sighting of Wolf Blitzer.

A large portion of the show focused on Billy Staples, the former rotund member of Airsick Productions, detailing his recent car accident resulting in brain damage and vertigo-like symptoms preventing him from leaving sea level.  Ron Bennington, a guest, provided much of this information, including details about Staples' strained relationship with his daughter and his rented suit for her wedding.  The conversation shifted to Bennington's magazine, his personal life (including his pursuit of a woman named Lily), leaked compromising photos of Oscar De La Hoya, Bill O'Reilly's controversial comments, and a rant by OSU football coach Mike Gundy.  The segment contained numerous off-color jokes and vulgar language, particularly regarding De La Hoya and Gundy.  Anthony again complained about his difficult commute due to road closures for visiting world leaders, and the hosts offered a prediction about Hillary Clinton's presidential chances. The show ended with several vulgar and humorous "line of the day" candidates.

The final segment opened with speculation about a "dump"—a broadcast interruption—possibly due to studio renovations.  Eric Logan, a seemingly in-studio employee, jokingly claimed responsibility, claiming he dumped segments based on Opie's words. The conversation turned to Logan's Oklahoma State/Oklahoma rivalry, revealing his allegiance to OU while working for a company partnered with OSU.  This segued into a discussion of Oscar De La Hoya, including a story about a woman who dated him, followed by a heated discussion between the hosts and their corporate overseers.  Extremely vulgar language was used, with the hosts comparing their situation to prostitution and referring to their corporate partners as "pimps," expressing frustration over unfair contract negotiations.  The conversation briefly touched on the General Motors strike and its impact on XM radio, before returning to the "dump" incident (confirmed as a technical glitch). More personal grievances were aired, including a particularly colorful description of their feelings toward a lawyer. The segment ended with banter about a previous segment with Jimmy "The Rat" Tirate and concluded with the hosts' general disdain for their corporate situation and a humorous closing bit about aggressive driving.

[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.

[00:01:30]  Before we start  The Opie and Anthony show  Good morning to everybody  Hi  A few things pal talk is ready to go  All done skating  For those people that want to take a look at us  As we do the radio show  You got the instant feedback off our website  Where you can interact with the radio show  As we do it  So many ways 
[00:02:00]  To interact with this program  Then you can go old school  And I don't know  Give us a call  Call?  So we can hear your voice  877-212  Are we  O-N-A  What?  I always talk in the middle of the phone number  Eh, it don't matter  Are we taking your  Faxed  Song requests?  What do you mean?  You want to go old school?  Oh yeah, well  Fax us your  Song requests  Remember that?  When we were working  Up in Boston  The fax machine 
[00:02:30]  Would come out  And it would just  It was one of those fax machines  Where it was just this  Rolling scroll of paper  With songs written on it  That we never looked at  It would fall onto the floor  And roll up  Into a scroll  A paper that  If you touched it wrong  Or scratched it  It would make  Marks all over it  Yeah, the good old days  Yeah, the good old days  Before computers  And before everyone  Had a cell phone  When you were like  DJ man  At a radio station  And the fax technology  Started  Yeah 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, during the commercial break  You would run down the hall  And it was like Christmas  Like, ooh  Ooh, what was that in?  Every once in a while  Someone would send you  A naked picture  And like the computer  Through the fax machine  Yeah, like  They got the computer  And instant feedback  Things like that  They have to have  The catchphrases  For certain things  And they had it  For fax  Like that was their big thing  Every station  Had to have a name  For their fax line  Or whatever it was  Ooh  Ancient technology  We invented instant feedback 
[00:03:30]  Though  A little known fact  About the Opie and Anthony show  I'll never deny that  Because it is  Absolutely true  If we would have just  Taken instant feedback  And trademarked that  Made it our own  Because we did  We coined the phrase  Like, what do we call this?  It's  Because people used to  Either call the show  Or they would fax the show  And that was pretty much it  But we had the program  That you could comment  As things were happening  And we said 
[00:04:00]  What do we call it?  You can give feedback  Instantly to the program  As we do it  Instant feedback  Well, it started with  An email account of yours  Back in  Yeah  The Worcester days  Yeah  And we would just  You know  We would give out  Your email account  On the air  Yep  And then we would  Just check your email  But they were like  Every so often  This is kind of dumb  You gotta sign in  Because this was like  The early days of email  It was just a pain in the ass  Big pain  Everything was  Just to check your email 
[00:04:30]  It's like  Oh, what a pain in the neck  So then we got  The engineer at the time  Or no  I guess we waited  Until we moved back  To New York, right?  Yeah  And then we got  An engineer on top  We got instant feedback  Up in Boston  Was that the first program  That was written for it?  Okay  Yeah, we were way ahead  Of the curve on that one  And it was instant feedback  And then  Drive around  And just hear them going  Hey, and get us on  Instant feedback  I got like 
[00:05:00]  Oh, God  Even using the same name  And everything  That would have been us  It would have been a check  Yeah  I need more checks  Checks  How was your ride in?  I gotta explain it  We never got to it yesterday  Because we went off  On four or five  Different tangents  I know  Which is the beauty  Of this show  See, other radio shows  You listen to  They got a schedule, man  610, we're doing traffic  615, we're doing local news  620, tanks coming in  To get the sports scores 
[00:05:30]  625, some chick named  Madam something  Is gonna do horoscopes  Horoscopes  Ugh  And that 645  Is gonna be  The gossip girl  Around the office  Is gonna come in  And give you a few tidbits  About gossip  But it's like a schedule  It's like a clock  Yeah  Here we  Not us  Just kind of make up crap  As we go along  And then we have  Things we do want to talk about  But then  Next thing you know 
[00:06:00]  We're off  Talking about something else  For 20 minutes  And then the thing  We really want to talk about  Never happens  We went on a tear yesterday  Yeah  The faithful listeners  Understand that  But maybe the new listeners  Don't  We had Kevin Smith  In yesterday  For the whole show  He was great  A lot of fun  To hang out with  And we were just  All over the place  Having a good time  So we didn't get to  The fact that  The UN General Assembly  Whoa  Is here  Hold on  Swastika  In a cornfield  A giant  Swastika  Is in a cornfield 
[00:06:30]  Like a crop circle  Wow  That's  Could someone  Find out what that's all about  By the way  The other thing  This is a very interactive  Show like we were saying  Ow  Sorry I just sat on  A little wheat  That was in my  Didn't brush myself off  Well enough last night  I guess  You would do  Something like that  Under a full moon  With just your  Underpants on  And your black socks  On it's own lawn  On it's own lawn  Right  I hear you're 
[00:07:00]  Building a pool  Is it going to be  In the shape of a swastika  No  It's a free form  It's going to look  Like a little lake  Of course not  Because it wouldn't be  Easy to do laps  Of course  That's the only reason  We'll find out  What's a swastika  Usually it's something fun  Like it's your  It's your  It's your hometown  Sports team's logo  Yeah  Or it's Santa Claus  Or something  Well  Something  Well someone has upped the ante  That  We'll get the story  In a minute  Yeah  But anyway  Yeah  The UN is in session  For what 
[00:07:30]  A week  I don't know  It's  Whatever it is  It's too long  It's unnecessary  We've said it before  The UN should just  Be out  Of New York City  It's ridiculous  People work here  A lot of people  The commute  And driving around the city  Is a nightmare  On any given day  You throw in roadblocks  And diplomatic  With their convoys  Of police cars  And everything else  Closing roads  At a moment's notice 
[00:08:00]  It's crazed  Roadblocks  And all that  One lousy car  Breaks down  In Manhattan  And the whole  Yeah  The whole grid system  Shuts down  They took 57th street  Which is a very important street  Running east and west  On Manhattan  It's two lanes  Each way  Pretty rare  In New York City  Especially around this area  And they  They took cones  And they put it  In the middle of  The road  Like the double yellow 
[00:08:30]  Now  Is a lane  So  In essence  You have one lane  Now going in  Either direction  And diplomats  Can just zip up and down  And cops  Up and down  The middle of the road  Through the cones  So I  I just wanted to  Get out of here  Yesterday  So I go to turn  On 57th  And one of the  Traffic savages  Told me I could not  And blew the whistle  I tried to hide  Behind a bus  The bus  Kind of  Blocked me 
[00:09:00]  Then I had to go  Around the other side  Of the bus  Where the traffic person  Could see me  But I turned my head  And I'm looking  Away  As I'm driving  In one direction  Looking in a complete  Other direction  Like I do not see you  I don't see you  And then I heard  The whistle blowing  And the  Hey  Hey  And I looked  Ahead of me  Realizing I wasn't  Going to be able  To step on it  And get away  So I had to go  Straight with  Everyone else  And was stuck  In traffic  For quite some time  I did have a  Celebrity spotting  Though  Thank god 
[00:09:30]  I was diverted  I saw  Ron Bennington  From the Ron and Fez  Program  Walking down  58th street  From the famous  Ron and Fez  From the famous  Ron and Fez  Radio program  I rolled my window  Down and started  Pointing and yelling  It's Ron Bennington  Everybody  And people were  All looking at him  And then he  Just kind of  Dismissed me  And walked away  He didn't want  To be recognized  So prima donna  That's what he is  At this morning's  Drive-in now 
[00:10:00]  Now it's carrying  Over into the morning  And I said  I go  The morning can't  Be that bad  These diplomats  Don't wake up  There's no convoys  Or things going on  In the morning  So I get in  There's more  They're telling people  To take mass transit  There's more traffic  On the expressway  Than I ever see  And they don't  Know how to drive  If you're gonna  Drive in  Do it fast  And get out of my way  Those are my rules  I understand people  Don't know all of my rules  I think that's  Everyone's rule out there  But they don't get it 
[00:10:30]  The people that are  Getting in the way  Aren't listening to  Our radio show  You're talking to  People just like you  Ant  They're morons  Here's a couple  Of my favorite things  That happened to me  This morning  The carpool lane  Which ends  At a certain point  During my commute  And just turns  Into a regular lane  I don't cross over  The divider  A lot  Unless I have to  But for the most part  I leave it alone  I'm driving down there  And when the lane  Opens up to the left lane 
[00:11:00]  The car in front of me  Will go into that left lane  And not increase their speed  By a fraction of a mile an hour  Why?  Why not stay in the lane you're in?  Why feel compelled  To move over to that left lane  And do the exact speed  You were doing  Now matching another car next to you  Instead of me  Who will get into that lane  And increase my speed  By 20 miles an hour at least  Because they've got to make 
[00:11:30]  That wall of cars  Why move?  You've got to make  The wall of cars  So other people  Can't get around you  It is infuriating  Do you high beam or beep?  I was beeping today  And I rarely beep  Because at that hour  There are moves  That can be made  Like if someone does that  I'll just go  To my ass  And then sweep around the right  Because usually it's open  But like I said  Today for some reason  A lot of cars on the road  On the expressway  Now this is a common thing  On the Long Island Expressway  Any cops listening  Any highway out there 
[00:12:00]  The main people  You should be pulling over  On the Long Island Expressway  And I know some people  From the satellite audience  Are not going to enjoy hearing this  Because there are a lot of truckers  Are you mother  F truck drivers  Driving your gravel and dirt  Without a cover on it  I was pelted this morning  Like people were taking  Handfuls of sanded rocks  And throwing it at my windshield  Just you hear 
[00:12:30]  Like you're in a rainstorm  But it's dirt and rocks  Because some idiot  Redneck jackass  Doesn't want to cover  His load  His dirt load  He's doing 60  So the wind is just  Blowing this out  That's one thing  I hate him  I wish a jackknife  I wish for his bloody death  I wish for his wife  To get the news  That he's been slaughtered  On a highway somewhere  That's just for him  But I'm not even as mad at him  As I am 
[00:13:00]  As the  The morons  That are getting pelted also  And won't pass the truck  They'll sit in this rock wake  And get pelted  And not let anyone else pass  Because either they're afraid  To pass them  They think more rocks  Are going to fall off the side  Get past the problem  That's the number one thing  To do on the roads  Get yourself past the problem  As quickly as possible  Well they're afraid  The truck's going to come in the lane 
[00:13:30]  And crush them against the door  I wish they would  Oh do I wish  A fiery wreck  Would happen like that  Dirt  Tons of dirt  Kill family of five  That's what I want to say  Because idiot dad  Didn't want to pass the truck  So I'm just sitting there  Like I'm going through  A meteor storm  It's like  My heat shield was  Was heating up  It is amazing  When you're in that situation  And you're thinking to yourself 
[00:14:00]  The trucker thought  It was okay  To just drive  To just drive  And stop flying out  And dude  They know they're doing it  They know they're doing it  You ever get behind  Like a garbage truck  And it's just  Crap is flying out  There's papers  That's funny  When like papers  Style parts  And little tricycles  A few tomatoes  They're flying out  And they're just cruising  They don't care  It's a smorgasbord  Of stuff  It's wonderful  Heading toward your windshield  The expressway 
[00:14:30]  Is the worst road  For these trucks  And I don't understand  How they can drive  Without the cover  Pulled over the top  And even with the cover  You're getting a little bit  But at least  A little bit  That's all they can do  I understand dirt  Has to get from point A  To point B  Wherever you're going  I'm sure there's no dirt there  So they gotta like  Ship in dirt  But at least  Some companies  Or drivers  Try to cover it up  There are guys though  Just  It's a mountain  It was a mountain  Stacked higher  Than the bed of the truck  That is now like 
[00:15:00]  A windblown sand dune  On the Sahara  Well they just want  To spread it out evenly  Yeah thanks  Just pelting  And when I traded  In my last vehicle  The windshield  Was pockmarked  You couldn't  I put on my wipers  And it was just  This smeared mess  Because there are holes  In your windshield  From these idiots  So I had to deal with that  And then I get into Manhattan  And now you gotta deal  With the cab drivers  And I'm sorry  If I'm going off on this  But I gotta get it 
[00:15:30]  Off my chest  There's a bus lane  Only  It's the far right  Right go ahead  And then there's  Two lanes of traffic  Like I said  On 57th  One lane is now closed  It's down to one lane  Now there's savages  In the cabs  About six cars deep  At the light  I know how these lights  Are timed  I do this every day  I gotta jump  Off of some of these lights  To make the next light  So I go into the bus lane  And I notice a cab  Is in the bus lane  One cab 
[00:16:00]  And then a line of cars  So I get behind the cab  Going  Alright this guy's strategy  Is my strategy  Jump on it  Get past this line of cars  To make the light  But in my head I know  Oh in my head I know  This idiot ain't gonna move  He went through the trouble  Of getting into the bus lane  Which  It's there  For this purpose  In the morning  In the afternoon  I guess buses use it  I don't know  I don't care  Or a little  Later in the morning  Yeah  So the light turns green  He 
[00:16:30]  Barely moves  And now he's stuck  Next to all these other vehicles  As am I now  Because I'm behind him  And no one's letting him in  So I cut over to the left lane  And won't let him in  And beep and flipping the bird  Now I get to the next light  And I gotta do the same thing  Now I'm head of the line  On the bus lane  And I see the cab next to me now  In the left lane  He's gunning up  He's like  Like pulling this move  At a drag strip  He thinks he's gonna  You know  Do what he did to the cab  On the last thing 
[00:17:00]  Block me  No  I step on it  The wheels screech  I'm driving an Escalade  And I smoke the tires  I get around him  For  A  Daily news truck  To pull out in front of me  As I'm tooling down 57  Pulls right out in front of me  I zip around him  I have about 50 feet to go  Before I pull over and park  And cut him off  And jam on my brakes  I hear his brakes  He is livid 
[00:17:30]  He's livid  I get out of my car  I slam the door  I lock it  I look at him  And I spit  Right in front of his truck  I'm getting into Jimmy's habit here  I looked right at his windshield  And I went  I spit at him  Pulls like  Anthony  You came out of nowhere  What happened  So I explained to him  That I was very angry  With my commute this morning  Very angry  It's day one  Day one  Of the commute in 
[00:18:00]  With this god damn  United Nations  Crap  Leaders from all over the world  In Manhattan  Yeah with their police escorts  Yeah  Staying in our fine hotels  And eating at the best restaurants  And then  Speaking somewhere  And yelling and screaming  How awful America is  It's just amazing  I  They should  Like you  You came up with it years ago  They should move the UN  Into the middle of a cornfield  Or  Nebraska  I got a field they can move it into  That one where they cut the swastika in  Move there  Oh they feel 
[00:18:30]  At home there  Yeah  Some of these leaders  Oh  I speak  Reasonably  I speak  I'm a reasonable man  Out there on the road  All I want to do  Is  I want people out of my way  Because I'm probably going to go faster than you  All right  They want more sounds on the show  No one put on the brake  And two on the gas  Hey  And there's no one driving the Ant Cat Pass

[00:20:00]  A jackass  Escalade that he's complaining about  I was just like this when I made 29,000 a year  Driving an Apollo air conditioning van  It has nothing to do with how much you make  Or where you're going  People gotta understand the rules of the road  Listen I agree with you  Get out of the way  But listen  A lot worse off than you my man  I understand that  I made something of myself  Curse me for it

[00:21:30]  Just leave  Why are they using the left lane, Opie?  Why are they even in there?  Cause it's there  Yeah  It's there to match the speed of the guy next to you in the middle lane  And sit there oblivious  If there's a parade behind you  And I've seen the cars  There's 12 cars behind a car in the left lane  And they have nobody in front of them  Do they look in the rear view mirror?  I want to know what goes through people's heads  Do they see that there's 12 cars behind them?  All piled up 
[00:22:00]  Do they see that no one is in front of them?  Do they understand they're blocking people and they're a problem  They don't understand how the lanes work  I guess not  That's the problem  They just see 2, 3, 4 lanes  And they just assume they are all equal  They're all equal  They're not  Get out of the way  The one on the far left is for the ones that want to speed  And they'll sit there and then get home and go  People drive like maniacs  They're on my butt all the time  They tailgate  They look at me when they pass me

[00:25:00]  They're just crazy  Between cars and traffic  They're animals  They back off on them  They are crazy  For the most part  When I see in the paper  That someone died in a motorcycle accident  I don't feel so bad  Because I just feel like  They probably caused that  And I know now  I'm going to get a lot of bikers calling  No, a lot of times  It's old people turning in front of the bike  But you see these ninja guys, man  Going 150 miles an hour on the highway  And then they're bored in traffic  So they'll decide to do a wheelie  For like a quarter mile  Craziest people on motorcycles? 
[00:25:30]  Black guys  Black guys  There's something that the stereotype  Hasn't really gotten a foothold yet  But you see a black guy on a ninja  He is going to be driving like a maniac  Oh, because he's a black ninja  I never thought of that  Just driving like a maniac  Alright, phone number 877-212-ONA  We start a few subjects there  If you want to, you know, join one of those  Give us a call, alright  It's O.P. and Anthony 
[00:26:00]  I'm not talking on this  Yeah, everybody  Wake up  It's 80's New Wave Tuesday  Before you go  E-Rock like picks out the 80's songs  And surprises us as we come back from break  It's the O.P. and Anthony show  He's just playing his iPod  According to artists whose lifestyle emulates his own

It's pretty huge  It's way, way up there  Yeah  I'm not into the console thing  But we've been there before  I like computers  I like computer games  Yeah, but Halo is huge  Yeah 
[00:27:00]  You should play a little Halo  I will  I'll probably wind up getting the  You should, just to check it out  The Xbox  Because I need it for GTA  Yeah  4  When that comes out  Can't wait for that  And a couple other games  I'm just not big on that controller thing  Hey, where's your video at?  Ah, yes  See, I was on my computer last night  Editing my video  Where I shoot the computer  My girlfriend's 
[00:27:30]  She was in Colorado  So she flies back  And she's in the cab coming back to the house  Last night about 11 o'clock  And I guess she's starting to get texts  And she goes  What is this about a computer and your rifle?  They go  Oh, I made another video  And you need a new computer  You didn't tell us yesterday it was her computer 
[00:28:00]  Well, it was  I use it  I use it sometimes  And that's the one that was screwing up  And that's the one I had to put around in  But I edited it down  And I put it on my little keychain thing  But now my keychain's in the garage  Well, it's the follow-up video to your famous Vista video  Yes  That got 1.8 million views on the website  I do mention that 
[00:28:30]  Oh, you do?  And I have a nice little spin-in of that graphic that comes in behind me  Oh, I was having a lot of fun with After Effects  And some of the other various software I use on my Mac  Well, we're patiently waiting for, you know, this video  Oh, I know  So bring it in  Well, I was doing that  And then my girlfriend gets home  At about 11 o'clock last night  And she's been gone, like I said, since Thursday  So we go into bed  And, you know, with all intentions of 
[00:29:00]  Of getting maybe some kind of good night's sleep  But when you haven't seen your girl in days like that  You kind of like  You kind of get close a little bit in bed there  And your hands start going  And before you know it  It's an all-out session  Dude, it was  I swear to you  I didn't get to sleep until  1.30 in the morning  1.30 in the morning  I'm exhausted  Totally exhausted 
[00:29:30]  You have to, you know  Sure  All good intentions of just going to sleep  And waking up for work  Well, that would be responsibility, though  Yeah, yeah  You're lacking the responsibility  It was  The department  Yeah, it was one of those things  Where it was just  Animal could not  You just can't, like, not  Knew it was, like, a bad idea  As far as being tired the next day  But  Yeah  There was no stopping it  You're a brilliant  You are a brilliant broadcaster  As I can say broadcaster 
[00:30:00]  And I've been doing this  Since I was 18  I try  But, uh  Responsibility  Ah, not so much  Eh  Not so much  Well, now that she's back  Maybe I'll be a little better  But when I was running solo there  For a few days  Oof  Yeah, oof-ah  Well, we had similar experiences  While you were enjoying that  I was, uh  My girlfriend and I were together  And, uh  I was laying on my back  Flicking my nipples  Looking straight in the air  She's going  It's okay  Just relax  Just relax  I'm like, just stop  Forget it  Oh, my  I'm not worth it  I suck  Oh, my God 
[00:30:30]  Just relax  Oh, God  It's like that scene in Animal House  In the car  Oh, it's so awful  With the freaking  With the glove  The surgical glove  Exactly  You made it just sound so clinical  Well, I mean  You know  Or in Fargo  And that hooker  Is doing, uh  Buscemi  Yeah  Yeah, that's it  Yeah, yeah, yeah  You like that, yeah  Before the Indian comes in  And beats the crap out of him  Love that scene  That hooker  I actually said 
[00:31:00]  I don't deserve to  I was so annoyed  My physical mess self  Hey, um  Before the break  We were talking about  A swastika in a cornfield  Swastika  You see these every season  You know  They got to cut  Some fine designs  In the cornfield  Yeah  And, uh  Well, this guy  Uh  I'm assuming it's a guy  Took it to the next level here  Well, another message of hate  Was cut into a cornfield  In New Jersey  You can't see it from the ground  But a state police helicopter 
[00:31:30]  Spotted the swastika  In a Washington township field  On Friday  Several acres of stalks  Were crushed and ruined  They say  It must have taken  The carvers hours  To finish that symbol  I want to offend  Flying Jews  It's the flying Jew  Jews in a plane  Are the problem  They spy on us  How even  What are you  Going to offend a Jew  For a half a second  What is that  I don't know  We're gone  You can't see it  From the ground  And you'll notice 
[00:32:00]  On the left side  Of the aircraft  Ladies and gentlemen  On the right side  Of the aircraft  If you look out  You could  See lovely fields  The fields  Of farms  Look out  On the other side  Of the aircraft  Any Jews  Might want to turn  Their head  And watch the movie  We've got a copy  Of Schindler's list  On the airplane  It might feel a little  Better than what's  Outside the window  It's a swastik  Don't be a  No it's not a swastik  It's just a new 
[00:32:30]  It's a new airport  With very curvy runways  Just trying to  Oh Jesus  You didn't notice  Something in that clip  Though  The newsreader  Was more disturbed  That the corn stalks  Were ruined  Yes  Listen again  Many stalks  Were killed  Listen to how  The newsreader's annoyed  Because like  The corn stalks  Were ruined  Listen  Another message  Of hate  Was cut into  A corn field  In New Jersey  You can't see it  From the ground  But a state police  Helicopter spotted 
[00:33:00]  The swastika  In a Washington  Township field  On Friday  Several acres  Of stalks  Were crushed  And ruined  Were crushed  And ruined  Yeah that's the  Problem there  The corn  Hey by the way  Old corn going  Never again  By the way  Our pal Bill O'Reilly  Put his foot in his mouth  Again  If we can find the story  I don't know all the details  But  Sylvia's in Harlem  Yeah he went to a  Black restaurant  It's a black restaurant  Basically 
[00:33:30]  It's owned by  Black owners  The cooks  Everybody in the  In the joint  Is black  Cook  And he was amazed  That the restaurant  Ran so well  Like our white restaurants  Oops  Or something like that  I'm paraphrasing  We need the details  But he  Yikes  He put his foot  In his mouth  If we can get that  That clip  That would be great  It's almost like  Implying that black people  Don't eat  What are you stupid  White Americans  Invented the restaurant  It was amazing  They took an order  Brought it to the kitchen 
[00:34:00]  And then food  And then food came out  Did he think that  Black people ordered food  And then just threw it  At each other  In front of the kitchen  He probably thought  He'd end up in a big  Iron pot in the kitchen  With them stirring it  With Bugs Bunny  It's actually a very famous  Restaurant here in New York  They serve soul food  I don't even know what they serve  I don't know  But he was amazed  By the service  Because you know  It's owned by black people  And wow  He's an ass  He really is  Not as big of an ass  As the Iranian president  Speaking at Columbia University 
[00:34:30]  Before we talk about  Mahmoud  Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad  Ahmadinejad  Yeah I think you're pretty close  Yeah  You're closer than anyone's  Going to get  Ahmadinejad  Ahmadinejad  Ahmadinejad  You want some Ahmadinejad  Ahmadinejad  Ahmadinejad  Of course I'm chemical  My grandmother  Rest in peace  We know  She was a saint  We get it  Made the best sauce  For the  Hey bless us all 
[00:35:00]  Rest in peace  Rest in peace  Hey  Hey  On the eyes of my children  They're always gambling away  Organs of loved ones  What's with the Italians  I don't think I've ever  Bet my mother's organs  On anything  Hey  On my mother's right breast  And her left ovary  Hey  On my mother's bung  Alright  My hand to my grandmother's uterus  This is the best sauce  Hey 
[00:35:30]  On my father's  The little bone  The stirrup in the ear  Just really nitpicking with parts  Yeah  I swear  On my grandfather's  Vaz Devrens  Oh wow  Hey  On my uncle's epiglottis  I swear  This is the truth  Oh she will make a man  I got  Make your mouth water  Your mouthed water  The man I got 
[00:36:00]  That she used to make  Hey  Hey  On my children's  Septim  Well it does sound like  An Italian dish there  Amada Dinajad  Amada Dinajad  Amada Dinajad  I was  What an  I was wrong  I trashed  Columbia  And not for having him  But for cancelling other things  Like if you're going to have him  They should have had  You know that they used some parts  From the college Columbia  To build the college endeavor  Endeavor  That was funny 
[00:36:30]  That's for the people  That linger longer  That was impressionable  I know what you're going to say  I just want to say  It seems like a wrestling thing  Like everyone was mad  At Columbia University  And the president  At Columbia University  The head muckity muck  Whatever they call him  Yeah  And he was just taking it  And he wouldn't let on  To the fact that  It's like  Don't worry  I'll handle this guy  And he did  And he brings him up  And then hit him with a chair  And threw sand in his eyes 
[00:37:00]  Yeah  Really hammered him  I mean  Lee Bollinger  Really smashed him  I mean  In that forum  The way  One intellectual  Would smash  A president  That he's invited to speak  Yeah  Yeah  He really gave him a bashing  Yeah  Because thinking that  He is an invited guest  Yes  You would think he would get  This cordial  Introduction  And then be able to  Speak his piece  But he prefaced  Bringing him up  With just a lambasting  And you think 
[00:37:30]  That it's going to be  Like a bunch of  Soft questions  And soft  He hit  The Iranian president  A lot harder  Than I would have  I mean he really  Hit him good  And the Iranian president  Just looked like a dope  By the end of it  First of all  He has  I love that  Freedom of speech thing  The Iranian president  Has hacked De Niro eyes  He looks like  He looks like a guy  About to do  Picture De Niro  If he denied the Holocaust  And took hostages  In 79  He looks like  A bad comic 
[00:38:00]  In 1989  Doing a De Niro impression  His hacked De Niro eyebrows  I bet if he made  The  The mouth  So yeah  He called him  He really  He called him  A petty  And cruel dictator  And they said  Ahmadinejad  Was shaken by the  He was not expecting  To be insulted  Like that  Would you touch his arm  And go  Ahmadinejad  To get a picture  A little longer  Here's how  What a groveling worm  I am  Would I only 
[00:38:30]  I would say  You know it's really good  That you're here  To educate people  Of course  And then just walk away  And hate his guts  You'd want a picture  With him though right  Wouldn't you want  A picture with him  Without a doubt  Of course I would  Of course  You have to get that picture  He provoked  I love the fact  That he was speaking  He provoked laughter  Yeah  By responding to questions  About Iran's execution  Of homosexuals  By saying  In Iran  We don't have  Homosexuals  Like in your country  I don't know  Who told you  We have this  What a terrible  Way to phrase  I don't know  Who told you  That's right beneath 
[00:39:00]  Why don't you  Ask my friend  If you don't believe me  Ask my friend  Who told you this  And it's  It's obvious  He doesn't understand  What's going on  In this country  Like the whole  Political correctness  And this  Equal rights  For every group  Things like that  Because to say  A line like  We don't have  Homosexuals  Like you do  There  Is such  An insult  It's such  A naive  And just  An outright lie 
[00:39:30]  It's just stupid  And it's stupid  Yeah  It did  It made everybody  Laugh  He was killing  And he is aware  There's homosexuality  In his country  He just doesn't  Want to acknowledge it  Well when they find it  It's remedied  So perhaps he's right  There aren't homosexuals  Like there are here  Because they breathe here  And they are  They live  There  I think they're probably  Cutting off certain parts  With spade shovels  No  What they do  If they catch it  In homosexual activity  They take a frying pan  To your nutsack  Ow 
[00:40:00]  Yeah  Yeah  I like that  It's a weird law  Over there  Wow  Yeah  Frying pans  To the nutsack  It's gonna hurt  When we get back  We'll give you the highlights  Of the Iranian president  And what he was talking about  At Columbia University  Love this guy  Including the clip  Where he says  There's no gays in Iran  Yeah  Not a gay in Iran  Unbelievable  It's Opie and Anthony  My torso  For the most part  Was just stiff  My toes  You know how  When you're struggling  My toes were shaking 
[00:40:30]  And pointed out  Like oh please  Please  Please  Oh my god  Look how old  Greg Nettles is  Oh time flies  His face doesn't look that bad  No he just doesn't look like  And that's Mickey Rivers  He's diving for a catch there  That's Mickey I think  Yeah that's Mickey on the right  Wow  Well obviously on the right  Jesus  What an idiot  You really didn't have to tell me  The difference between  Mickey Rivers  And Greg Nettles  Well just in case  You were gonna confuse him  With the shadow 
[00:41:00]  That's on set too  What  He's a bit dark  He's a bit dark Mickey  Mickey was always a bit dark  Anyway so  Yeah you had to relax  And  How did it end  Did we even get to the end  Of the story  Well the way it should have  It ended  Like let's just say  She was  To do like  To have a night  Like Anthony had  Was impossible  Due to my floundering  But  Floundering  My floundering  But she's a cool girl  She's never  Like bent out of shape 
[00:41:30]  At stuff like that  But it seems like  You guys are too clinical  You just gotta go at it  Well no she was  There shouldn't be like  Relax  Calm down  Close your eyes  She was being playful  And whatever  And helping me out  And I was getting mad  And I'm like just stop  And she's like why  I'm having fun  Like she was like  Just relax  Everything's good  Yeah  Like don't worry about it  Well perfect song  For 80's new wave Tuesday  Good choice  Hard to relax  Hey on the instant feedback  People still kind of  Pissed off at Anthony  Talking about driving  And stuff  I don't know why  I don't know why  Your rant pissed off 
[00:42:00]  People out there  That pisses off  The people that  Think that people  Drive like maniacs  When they're the problem  But you were  Talking for them  I'm talking for you  Okay  Frank from East Islip  Anthony  Long Island expressway  Speed limit is 55  In any lane  Don't  No  Stop it  Hold on  Hold on  He continues  Why should I have to move  When I'm doing 75 to 80  And that's not fast enough  For you  Go the F around me  And yeah  I don't look behind me  When I'm driving  Not my problem  What you're doing  That is an example  Of an idiot  That is an idiot 
[00:42:30]  You constantly  I look behind me  I'm constantly  Scanning the mirror  I'm not one of those guys  Also that you're gonna see  With a cop  Up his tailpipe  Or a fire truck  Up his tailpipe  Just driving  I love those people too  It's like  You don't see or hear this guy  I am constantly  Scanning the mirrors  I know what's around me  At all times  And if this guy  Yeah  If you're doing 70  Or 75  And I'm doing 85  Get out of my way 
[00:43:00]  I don't care what the speed limit is  What are you  Missed a law  Are you the law  Make a citizen's arrest  Because I went around you  Move over  You're in the way  I want to see  A whole video  Of citizen  Citizen  Citizen  Citizen  Combat  Combat  Oh god  Is that genius  I want to see that  Citizen's arrest  Gone bad  Excuse me sir  I'm making a  Citizen's arrest  Uh you  Yes you  Citizen's arrest  Oh  That's great 
[00:43:30]  And then Scott M from Hop Hog  He's becoming a regular  On the instant feedback  He writes  Wow  Ant's life sucks  He got some  He got some last night  Went to sleep late  Woke up in his huge house  To drive his awesome car  To his phenomenal job  Wah wah  Wah  Wah  I'm still a human being  That's right  No one feels bad for you  Why are you tired  I was having sex  Wow  Rough being you  I was having  Animalistic sex  It's you 
[00:44:00]  It's not usually that late  Is what I was getting at  I wasn't even getting the point  I wasn't being a braggard  I was saying that  It's not usually  1.30 in the morning  That I'm getting to sleep  For any reason  Sex or video games  Or anything  Did you never use the word  Braggard again  I hate that word  Braggard  Okay  I hate the word braggard  Well now you're being a braggard  About the hatred of the word  True  You don't want to be  Scorned a braggart  A braggard  So Iranian president  Speaks at Columbia  And I kind of like 
[00:44:30]  That freedom of speech thing  Cause it made him  Yeah it worked out  It made him sound  Like a complete dope  Yeah  And that Bollinger  I hated his wig  I gotta say this  About the president of Columbia  Whatever that thing is  On your head  Remove it  It's horrendous  I can see in a black and white  Daily news photo  I can see where the line is  That comes from  The mongoloid shop  It's terrible  That is an awful wig  It is a terrible  Terrible wig  I want to take it off  And eat custard out of it  Marge wants to adopt it 
[00:45:00]  Put it in the cattery  Right  Linger longer  It looks like  An upside down  Seashell candy dish  I want to spray shellac  On his wig  And throw candy in it  What are you doing  Obviously a brilliant intellectual  Yeah he's very articulate  Yesterday I didn't even get to it  We were just  I saw him on Good Morning America  And I couldn't  All I could do  Is look at his hairpiece  Yeah  It's terrible  It's very distracting  It's not needed  No  You don't need to look 
[00:45:30]  You're the president  Of Columbia University  Yeah  That's enough to get you laid  He would look distinguished  Right  He'd be like  Captain Picard  Well  Here's the highlight  Here's your science fiction  Talkie rock  Well it's like when you see guys  Who are in a suit  With a baseball hat on  Yeah  It's like you know  What they're trying to cover up  It's like they're probably  Getting plugs  It's like what are you doing  We were in a restaurant  We saw a guy with a suit  Looked like Eric Logan actually  Just like Elo  But younger and thinner  And he wasn't drinking alcohol  Yeah exactly  He didn't have like  A stupid like construction hat on 
[00:46:00]  With two upside down  Bud Likes  You know on the phone  With the head of the PGA  Trying to work out  More deals for XM  Come on what are you going to do  Going to serious  All right  Get a hold of yourself  As he slurps more  Out of the straws  Right  I think my left  And my left tank is empty  And the thing Elo doesn't know  Is like he's always going  Oh yeah one more  When he's leaning back  Going one more  One more  Before the dinner has even come 
[00:46:30]  That whoever he's talking to  They're like making the left  To the right eyes at each other  Like why is this drunk with us  So this guy looks like Eric Logan  But he had like the baseball hat on  And a nice suit  And he brought his own bottle of wine  So he called the rest  I overheard the conversation  He was with a smoking hot  I thought she must be a hooker  He was like smoking  And I'm like this guy  Is trying to cover up the plug  You can't do that  Just like either  I mean it's got to be difficult  But the baseball hat  With the suit looks  You look like a dummy  Yeah  And this thing on his head 
[00:47:00]  It should have a Met emblem on it  It really should  He looks like he's wearing  Ola Rude's helmet  This should be like an ear covering  On the left side  Bollinger's hairpiece  Is atrocious  Although it's not team colors  Unless he plays  For the wispy haired gentleman  Now batting  In the wispy haired gentleman  Alright let's get into this  A little bit  Four quick clips  We got the Columbia University  President speaking about  Ahmadinejad  You described the Holocaust  As a fabricated legend 
[00:47:30]  One year later  You held a two day conference  Of Holocaust deniers  For the illiterate  And ignorant  This is dangerous propaganda  When you come to a place  Like this  This makes you  Quite simply  Ridiculous  You are either  Brazenly provocative  Or astonishingly  Uneducated  Wow that is awesome  That's the Iranian president  I mean  Say what you want about him  He's still the president  Of Iran  Oh I thought he was  On the phone  Talking to me  Jesus  Alright  I was ready to 
[00:48:00]  Have a little rebuttal  To him  I didn't realize  That was a tape  Oh that is hilarious  That's actually  That's actually  The one decent part  Of Anthony  That's Anthony's subconscious  Talking to him  While he's watching  These videos online  But he was a good speaker  What?  Just knew how to  Rally a crowd  Ahmadinejad  Ahmadinejad  Responds by saying this  I like turtles  Yeah  The guy likes turtles  How could you not like  A guy that likes turtles 
[00:48:30]  What did  Heck De Niroize say?  Well this is what  He had to say  To attempt  In a so called manner  To vaccine  Provide vaccination  Of some sort  To our students  And our faculty  I think  The text read  By the dear gentleman  Here  More than addressing me  Was an insult  To information  And the knowledge  Of the audience here  Wow  He didn't really  Answer the question  No he didn't  Why doesn't he run  For office here 
[00:49:00]  Or the translator  Didn't do a good job  Kind of fudged it a little  I was thinking the other day  That we rely on translators  A lot more  That is pretty important  We really rely on them  Maybe too much  Had no idea what he was saying  Right  And it's pretty much  Right  You gotta believe  That she's good enough  At what she does  To translate it  In a way that's accurate  And I'm thinking  Some of these translators  They might fall a little behind  And they just have these  Phrases  That go to like  I gotta catch up  I'll leave that out  Death to America 
[00:49:30]  You know  Just throw in those dumb  Jews  Right  Oh crap  I don't know what he said  The last five words  Because I was trying to translate  What he said prior  So  Right  Jihad  Yeah  It's kind of annoying  There's a thing about Barack Obama  Like I'd chat with him  And it's like  In a way  People are saying  That we shouldn't talk to him  It's like  I kind of like the fact  That he's here  I don't care if it's propaganda  And he's trying to win over  The American people  I think he really understands 
[00:50:00]  That there's a major problem  With the US  And now there's all these talks  About invading Iran  Which I don't want us to do  No  No  That to me  Why else would him and Assad  Do interviews with Diane Sawyer  It's a public relations move  It is a PR move  To win over Americans  He's trying  But I think he's got  Ulterior motives there  I don't think he wants to show  That he's a good guy  Because he's a good guy  I think  He saw how it doesn't work  Doing it the other way  Dressing in the garb  Dressing in that  You know  Whatever they wear over there 
[00:50:30]  I don't even know what it's called  But when you look at it  You know they hate Americans  Yeah  And then  You know  He dressed in western clothing  Comes over  He's accessible  To the media  And  It kind of  It makes people think  Hmm  Maybe this guy's on the up and up  He's alright  But no  This is  This is very calculated  You're right  I agree  But I think he's doing it  Because he wants some kind of  He wants some kind of relationship  Or he's worried  That something bad 
[00:51:00]  Is going to happen  Especially after Israel  Just I think  Hit Syrian  Yeah  So I like the fact  That he's at least worried  But he has a history though  To hell with the US  You understand what I mean  It's like  I'm more worried about those guys  Yeah  Because they can care less  They're wild like a politician  Yeah this guy is acting like a politician  And I think if he  After everything he's doing  This whole PR thing  If he did pull some  Really bad shenanigans  If I'm going to use the word shenanigans  He would be  Really on the outs 
[00:51:30]  With the world community  Why else would he come to America  Unless he wanted  You know something from us  Yeah  Like when a lunatic out there  One of these lunatic dictators  Pretty much shut themselves off  From the western world  They're very dangerous  When they do something kooky  You go  Well that's him  He's a nut  Yeah  But this guy  You'd be like  Jeez this guy came to the UN  He's speaking  And then he pulls this crap  You know  So he's kind of almost  Putting himself  In a corner  By doing 
[00:52:00]  What he's doing  Well Bush called  The axis of evil  Iran  North Korea  And Iraq  We know what's going on in Iraq  And North Korea recently  Just said they were going to  Dismantle the nuclear program  Well can you believe that  Well just the fact that  He's willing to do that  As opposed to  Shaking his fist like he was  I mean it's something  A lot of behind the scenes  Stuff went on with North Korea  By the way  A lot of money was exchanged  They're broke  They are so broke  And impoverished over there  That they'll do anything  To try to  Just feed their people 
[00:52:30]  So they use  Every so often  They use this nuclear option  As a way to get the world  To get some money  To get some stuff  Right  Give them some goods  And then they go  Alright  We got more on the Holocaust here  Well Kim Jong Il  Just before you said  What he wanted  To get rid of the nuclear program  Is he wanted  A lift for his shoes  And he wanted a copy  Of the Bollinger wig  So he could display it  To his people  They wanted to send it  Around the country  Like King Tut  And they just wanted people  To come and pet it  It's the wig 
[00:53:00]  Of a white intellectual  Just to pet it  And maybe give it  Like one of those  Shooka shooka shooka  Shooka shooka  The way you would  Like on the spine  Of an animal  Yes  The way you'd  Shooka shooka  The spine of a cat  If you put it on the floor  And scratch the back  It would look like a cat  When they put their back up  They hunch their back  It would look like a grey cat  I'll bet you  Like if he's having sex  And his girl  Like just kind of  Runs her fingernails  Down his scalp  I'll bet you his wig  Actually like does  Like kind of  Terse up like a cat  And lifts off his head  And he's going to  Pat it back down  Don't do that 
[00:53:30]  Don't do that  It tickles my head  And a tail in the back  Sticks straight up  Stupid silly thing  On your head mister  We're on the holocaust  He just doesn't believe  It really happened  Huh  No he's one of these  You know  But he'll never admit to it  It's all very shady  They had that meeting  Of the holocaust deniers  And  Well let's see what he says  He got up and talked  About numbers  It's like  And even that  Is ridiculous  Because they were like  Well you know  I guess the  The number they give 
[00:54:00]  Is 8 million Jews  Were killed  During the holocaust  I've heard 6  6  Yeah  Well it's been up to  Up to 8  And then as low as  You know 4  But they're saying  Well  Come on  It was probably like  200,000  Or something  Well let's get to  The clip here  Can you explain  Why you believe  More research is needed  Into the facts  Of what are  What are  What is  Unincontrovertible  Thank you very much  For your question 
[00:54:30]  I'm an academic  And you are as well  Can you argue  That researching  A phenomenon  Is finished  Forever  Done  Can we close the books  For good  On a historical event  There are different  Perspectives  That come to light  After every research  Is done  Why should we  Stop research at all  Why should we start  The progress of  Science and knowledge  You shouldn't ask me 
[00:55:00]  Why I'm asking questions  You should ask yourselves  Why you think  That it's questionable  Why do you want to  Stop the progress  Of science and research  Wow  He's such a phony  This is what's annoying  Because everybody  Knows what he's doing  And then he denied  Saying that the  Holocaust didn't exist  He goes no I said  Granted that this happened  And then he seguated  The city of the palace  The word granted  Means I understand  It happened  So he kind of  Changed his tune about  It's like you deny  The Holocaust happened  Because your thing  Is you hate the Jews 
[00:55:30]  And you want Israel  Wiped off the map  So don't act like  You're just investigating  Something that hasn't  Been investigated  Yeah this is like  Now he's trying to say  That I'm just questioning  I'm trying to learn more  I'm not going to take  At face value  That 6 million Jews  Were killed during  The Holocaust  I'm you know  I'm open to  All this other  Knowledge from other  People  To make my assessment  Like it hasn't been  The only thing  They're actually  Finding these days  Are more mass graves  That's all they ever find  They don't go  Wow 
[00:56:00]  We just found  5 million Jews  That were hiding  They were alive  You're not going to  Find living people  You're only going to  Find more dead people  He doesn't even want  To agree that a lot  Were killed  Yeah  Yeah  No that's open to debate  Right  Wow  He knows  This guy's a character  He knows  And Bollinger  Said to him  It's the most documented  Event in world history  As far as  All you see is  Videos of it  And Survivor  We all know it happened  Yeah  And to deny it  Is like  It's not even real  It's just this aggressive 
[00:56:30]  It's an angry hatred  Of the Jews  He was like  Bobby Fisher  Is a Holocaust denier  One of the greatest  Chess players in history  He's a genius  And he knows better  It's like  You know that it happened  It's a taunt  Alright why is he denying  It's a taunt  Oh exactly  That's why  Okay  It is a taunt  It's all it is  It's such a psychological  Taunt  To Jewish people  Because it's  It's so much to them  It means so much  That it's a way  To get  It's a way  To turn the screws  You know  There's no way  To debate it  Where someone would go 
[00:57:00]  Oh maybe the Holocaust  Didn't happen  Yeah  Oh yeah  Oh it's an impossibility  And the only people  That agree with this  Idiot  Are self-hating Jews  Like these stupid Jews  Against Israel  Yeah yeah  With these self-haters  Who think God's  Going to give them  A homeland  It's just  I guess you know  Yeah  Well here's the clip  Everyone's talking about today  The gays in Iran clip  The freaking audience  Just losing their minds laughing  Here it is  He killed

[00:58:30]  Possibly say that  How could  A leader  Of a country  Say that  Maybe because  They say Islam  Cures all ills  And to acknowledge  That that goes on  When Islam  Is the  Like the religion  In charge  Is a slam on Islam  Wow  It's silly  It's childlike  Wow  He really is  Everyone calls Bush dumb  And Bush is not  A great speaker  But this guy  He's a dope  He's a student  He took over  Least I know  We got homos  All smug

[01:02:30]  That's gonna make me laugh all morning  I don't know who's told ya  Good morning it's the Opie and Anthony show  80's New Wave Tuesday  In effect  How embarrassing is that to be speaking like that  To be speaking like that  And to say something like that  Have the audience of college students just laugh at you  And there wasn't even a doubt in their minds in the audience  But they really laughed  Time to laugh  And he's a bright guy  Cause he went  He's a college guy  The students took over in 79  But he's a dummy compared to  I'm sorry  Columbia's  You can hear but he's not bright enough to have intellectual arguments 
[01:03:00]  Nah  Like that  Hey before we get into the Bill O'Reilly thing  A little fun  Guy stuns his girlfriend  Oops  But this is really good because he talks her into it  Like ah it's gonna tickle a little bit  Yeah that's all  It's not gonna be that bad  She doesn't ever look at YouTube I guess  It'll tickle a little bit  It'll tickle just a little bit though  It won't tickle much  But it will tickle  It'll tickle  Just a little bit  What are you doing?  Like it's not gonna  It's not gonna tickle

Please just stay still  You'll be okay I promise  You'll be okay  Alright just  Just stay still  Close your eyes  No I'm not  Close your eyes  Trust me close your eyes  I won't move  Just I'm not  Trust me close your eyes  Trust me  Let me tell you what's going on here  Trust me  They're trying to make their YouTube video  Everyone wants their YouTube video  Yes  To be huge  The acting is awful  Yeah  Sounds like a pedophile  Trying to convince somebody  It's only gonna tickle 
[01:04:00]  What?  What a creep  The acting is awful  I am not  Trust me close your eyes  I won't move  Just I'm not  Trust me close your eyes  Get your eyes closed and everything  You ready?  You ready?  Please don't  Promise me you won't open them  I'm scared  Promise me  Okay  Alright  Ali  It hurt  That's 
[01:04:30]  It hurt  That's some bad acting right there  Hey why were they doing the fat montage on TV?  I don't know  I just laugh every time I see the fatty b-roll  It's whenever the news does the fat story  And they have to send some guy out  I don't even think they send anyone out anymore  I think it's the same b-roll that's been going around for years  Every so often they gotta update it when styles change maybe  I don't know  But it's that from neck to maybe mid-thigh of big fat people 
[01:05:00]  Or like the back side view of someone fat eating an ice cream cone  Big fat ass walking away  Yeah and it's usually you know your health  They're talking about fat foods or something like that  And it's just big fat people  And you know they have to look and go  Hey that's me  Hey that's what I wore today  That's oh my god that's me  Well they broke out the fat montage on the news  So trying to figure out why  Hey Bill O'Reilly  Bill O'Reilly 
[01:05:30]  What a tool  He really is a tool  He really is  He's just  He's a pompous ass  I'll start there  He  Exactly  He's a  He's a jerk off  Yeah  He absolutely is  And to me like what  Like  Door racist is thrown around too much  But when you hear like a guy like this  A pompous ass like this talking  That's the way a racist thinks  It's always subtle  Yeah  No I'm just trying to explain things  It's like  You know you know what  When black leaders come out against hate speech 
[01:06:00]  When it's comedy  When it's a comedy show  And you're making people laugh  You're  You're  Talking about stereotypes  Things like that  That's the people they attack  And  Say it's hateful  And hate speech  What Bill O'Reilly said  Was far worse than anything  That's ever been done on a comedy show  Cause he meant it  Cause he meant it  Absolutely  He meant it  This show is an ignorance  And a 
[01:06:30]  An ignorance  Coupled with this  Pompous  Superiority  Complex that he has  It's amazing  That he's getting away  With saying this  It's just white elitism  And I  I think he should be able to say it  And he should be able to be the pompous  Oh yeah  Biased ass that  Good be that way  But then just don't complain  When people do things to be funny  Yeah  That's the only annoying thing  Is that he  Here's the headline  O'Reilly surprised  There was no difference  Between Harlem restaurant 
[01:07:00]  And other New York restaurants  This is the first time  He ventured up there  I guess  Listen to this  From his own show  I think  Black Americans are starting  To think more and more  For themselves  And they're getting away  From the Sharptons  And the Jacksons  And the people  Trying to lead them  Into a race  Are they?  Starting to  They've been thinking  For themselves  For many many years  What's he talking about  First of all  Guys like Sharpton  And Jesse Jackson  Are so famous  Because of guys like you  And other media people  Because they give you  Great sound bites 
[01:07:30]  And they say awful  Idiotic things  But most black  I've never  And I'm 39  I've never talked to black people  Who said Sharpton was great  And Sharpton is like  A leader for me  I look up to him  They don't think like that  When you see black people  Rallying around Al Sharpton  It's because they belong  To the same  Whatever he belongs to  That action network  Which is much bigger  Than Al Sharpton  Yeah  He's just a part of that  And it's bust in people 
[01:08:00]  Like I think a lot of  Sometimes they're paid  For their appearances  In these protests  I think a lot of the people  That are part of that organization  Yeah  They would like a new leader  A new guy  Yeah please  Black people are starting  To think for themselves  Starting to  What year is this?  That's great  White elitism  Like that's what it is  Yeah  And it's not done angrily  Or aggressively  But that's exactly what it is  Starting to  I would say they started  Thinking for themselves  God  Way before  72 
[01:08:30]  Jacket  Way before 2007  You asked  They're starting  I don't know  Maybe slavery was happening  People were thinking for themselves  Because nobody was going  Slavery this is fantastic  Yeah right around then  I think that  Most people would say  Right around then  I think maybe when they were  Rounded up they're thinking  For themselves  And thinking  Yeah  This sucks  Like that probably  Is thinking for yourself  Well we could argue  What the actual date is  But I think  We'd all agree  That it was way before  The year 2007  Way before  Bill O'Reilly  Made his pilgrimage 
[01:09:00]  To Harlem  Right  Just the fact  Just the  Like the pompous  Like the fact that he thinks  That he thinks for himself  And he's a brilliant free thinker  Yes  And hey isn't it nice  Isn't it nice  That the little children  Are starting to think like  Isn't that nice  Maybe someday  They'll attain the ability  To think for themselves  Like I do  And he's amazed  That they sat at the big table  With him  Which was him going to  The Harlem restaurant  Yeah  Like look at the little kid  Sat at the big table  Yep  And behaved like a  I couldn't get over it 
[01:09:30]  It's amazing  It gets better  This is what white America  Doesn't know  Ah what happened  What happened there  I think black Americans  Are starting to think  More and more for themselves  And they're getting away  From the Sharptons  And the Jacksons  And the people  Trying to lead them  Into a race based culture  You know  Just trying to figure it out  Look I can make it  If I work hard  Get educated  I can make it  You know I was up in Harlem  Starting to figure that out  Really?  So now they're just starting  To see the value of education  Yeah  Cool Bill  Yeah 
[01:10:00]  Blacks just started going to college  Yeah just started  I guess  Right Bill?  Dope  He really is  The first one to attack other people  And just a dope  This should be more offensive  As being racist  Than anything  Any radio personality  Has ever said  In jest  Yes thank you  Thank you  Thank you  In Harlem  A few weeks ago  And I actually had dinner 
[01:10:30]  With Al Sharpton  Is a very very interesting guy  Who footed the bill for that one  Jesus  Oh Bill did  Oh Bill he has to tell you  He'll tell you  He is the biggest ass  I'll have some more chitlins  I want some of them harmony grits  Keep bringing them  Bill O'Reilly's paying  I don't even need to pay  Keep it coming  Hey everybody  It's all on Bill O'Reilly  Bill O'Reilly 
[01:11:00]  Hey Reverend Al  I noticed you brought your own plate  I brought my own plate  It's my big old medallion  I used to wear  My hubcap medallion  Just turn it over  Load it up  Just load it up with food  More pig knuckles  And a harmony grip  And Sylvia  Give me a takeout bag  I'm taking some home with me  Bill O'Reilly's paying  This is part of my reparations 
[01:11:30]  I'm going off the diet for a while  Why?  Cause Bill's paying  There you go  You know  I'm thinking for myself  I'm thinking I'm gonna have seconds  And thirds  And thirds  You know when you  When you pay for someone's meal  Yeah  You shouldn't tell everybody  That you paid for someone's meal  Yeah  Don't bring it up  You just kinda do it 
[01:12:00]  You just kinda  Paid for them  You kinda sneak your credit card over  To the waitress or the waiter  Yeah  Get it done and that's it  I paid cash because I'm not stupid  We haven't even played  I don't want someone stealing my credit card number  I'm sure he did  We haven't even played the line  Where he has to tell everybody  That he paid  Oh of course  Here it is  Very interesting guy  And he comes on a factor a lot  And then I treated him to dinner  Because he's made himself available to us  And I felt that I wanted to  Take him up there  And we went to Sylvia's 
[01:12:30]  How about you just treat him to dinner?  I treated him  Not only did he have to tell everyone  He treated him to dinner  He had to explain why he treated him to dinner  How did he invite him?  Did he call up and go  Hey boy  Are you hungry?  What do you want?  What an ass  Would you like to go to that negro place uptown?  And for a guy who's such a creep that Sharpton is  And he is a creep  Why are you sitting there having dinner with him?  Because it's show business  Both of these idiots are not in the news business 
[01:13:00]  Or the civil rights business  They're in show business  Their purpose is to get on television  And become a celebrity  And then market that  So you can wear nice suits  Don't lie  And if you don't believe that  Go to Bill O'Reilly's website  He's now selling  Don't tase me bro  Bumper stickers  Is he?  It's bumper stickers  The other day I said it was t-shirts  Bumper stickers  They're in showbiz  I'm not going to tase your car  Why wouldn't you make a t-shirt? 
[01:13:30]  It's just silly  This O'Reilly thing gets even better  Here we go  Because he's made himself available to us  And I felt that I wanted to take him up there  And we went to Sylvia's  A very famous restaurant in Harlem  I had a great time  And all people  He sounds uncomfortable just saying this by the way  Right  And by the way he took him up to Sylvia's  So he had something to talk about on his dumb show  Yeah  It wasn't just like  Where do you want to eat?  I don't know  Let's go to Sylvia's  It was planned ahead of time  So we got out of the armored personnel carrier 
[01:14:00]  Right in front of the place  And it was fantastic  Some producer came to Bill O'Reilly and said  Hey I got a great idea  Good angle here  Why don't you get Reverend Al  And bring him to Sylvia's  And then you can talk about your experience on The Factor  Or your radio show  Uh huh  That's how this all came about  He's a very famous restaurant in Harlem  You know what he sounds like?  He sounds uncomfortable  Who's ever said he sounds uncomfortable?  Yeah he does  He sounds like he's so afraid  That he's gonna say exactly what he really means  Right  He's so trying to sound a certain way  He's trying to sound casual 
[01:14:30]  He's trying to sound casual  He's trying to sound casual and natural  Like yeah well Sylvia's up there in Harlem  Like just saying that he was in Harlem  He's uncomfortable  He wants to say  I was frightened  I know that place is horrible  I have this image  And that's what he wants to say  But he's just  He's talking too fast  And he doesn't want people to know that  They're on to him  Yeah  That he actually did this  Almost like a publicity stunt  Yeah  Uh huh  That's why he's so casual about it  Like ah we went to 
[01:15:00]  Oh yeah Sylvia's up there in Harlem  He made himself available to us  And I felt that I wanted to  Take him up there  And we went to Sylvia's  A very famous restaurant in Harlem  I had a great time  I had a great time  And uh  All people up there  Tremendously respectful  They all watched The Factor  Yeah  You know in Sharp that I walked in  It was like big commotion and everything  But everybody was very nice  Was it?  And I couldn't get over the fact  That there was no difference between  Sylvia's restaurant  And any other restaurant in New York City  I mean it was a  It was exactly the same  What was it supposed to be? 
[01:15:30]  What was he expecting?  I mean I paid  And they put the money in the register  I thought they would eat it  That's great  What's the matter with you?  And by the way  Kevin from Connecticut  Brings up a great point  Opie you guys did a photo shoot uptown  And you weren't bragging about it  You were terrified  As you should have been  Yeah right  Yeah we went up to Harlem  I went up to Harlem  And did a photo shoot too  It was great  Because this liberal douche  That decided he needed to take our picture  For an article that appeared in  One of the Boston magazines  He was like 
[01:16:00]  Yeah let's go uptown man  And find this old newsstand man  That's all burnt out  It'll be great for you guys  Yeah  And we stepped out of our car  That they were nice enough  To get us for the day  And we were horrified  Yep  We were like  Can we hurry up with this?  Maybe you're comfortable  In this atmosphere  But we're not  I felt like quoting Boone  From Animal House  Right right right  I think you guys should be  Leaving  Leaving  What a good idea  Exactly 
[01:16:30]  We are gonna die  And it wasn't  And this was  This was so over the top  This neighborhood  Most of the buildings  In this particular block  Or two block area  Were completely burnt out  Yeah  They were just lunatics  Walking around  Yeah this wasn't  Sylvia's  With Reverend Al  No  And there were like  And then there were  People like  Getting closer and closer  To us going  Wow this is kind of  An easy target  And this liberal douche  Taking our pictures  Like I had a few more  I'm like no 
[01:17:00]  You got the shot  We're out of here  Not taking a chance  On my life  Because you're  So trustworthy  In this area  And Sylvia's  Is not exactly a  It's not exactly  This excursion  To the edge  It's a very famous restaurant  And they're not shocked  When they see white people  Come in to eat  Right right  They don't look like that  They're white people  They were getting at  Well he's thinking  It's like he took this  Trip to the dark side  Right  And he went to this  Black place  With black people  Black people  He was a white explorer 
[01:17:30]  And with black people  Yeah  They served him food  They were all black  I couldn't get over it  Blana  Like he was taking a real chance  With his life  Blana went in with his  Elephant gun  Like an adventurer  Right  He had like the stupid explorer hat  Yeah  A pith helmet  I went in with Al Sharpton  I was wearing a pith helmet  I couldn't believe  It was just like  I expected  Grass skirts  They had on trousers  Ladies and gentlemen  Ho ho ho  What an adventure  My monocle fell out of my eye  What is they thinking 
[01:18:00]  They're not surprised  They didn't look at your white skin  And run around  And point  And talk in their native tongue  No one is surprised  To see white people in Sylvia's  No one  I was able to read the menus  It wasn't just  Some kind of symbols  That meant clicking  Clicking  The guy's amazed  He expected like  He expected the food  To be killed right there  Like a buffalo  Would run through the restaurant  And somebody would spear it  And they'd eat it right there  Without cooking it  What a dope  Just what a dope  Here we go 
[01:18:30]  I mean it was  It was exactly the same  Even though it's  Run by blacks  Primarily black patronship  It was the same  Well  Well yeah  I really don't know  What he was expecting  I know if you go to certain like  Clubs at night  You're gonna see different things  If you go to a black club  Than if you go to a white club  That's for sure  You might have  You might even get into some trouble  Or you might have fun  I don't know  But when you go to Sylvia's 
[01:19:00]  It's a famous restaurant in Harlem  And he's talking about it  Like he just went to Africa  He went to the motherland  And he's having some dinner  On the Serengeti  Translation  He's amazed that blacks  Can run a restaurant  That they can run a restaurant  All by themselves  And behave  And he said  This is another telling line  When he gets out of the car  He goes everybody was respectful  Yeah well why wouldn't they be  You're a celebrity  It's almost like people 
[01:19:30]  When he said he went to Sylvia's  People were gonna go  My god Bill  They're all blacks  Did they throw rocks at you?  What did they do?  Must have been horrible  Did they try to push you  And bite you?  What happened?  They're all blacks  They accepted American currency  Not to drink it  It was wonderful  I was able to actually use  They knew that these were presidents  They knew they were leaders  On these bills that I was giving them  They were all respectful  Yeah it's a fancy restaurant 
[01:20:00]  It's a famous restaurant  You jackass  I mean it was exactly the same  Even though it's run by blacks  Primarily black patronship  It was the same  And that's really what the society's all about now  Here in the USA  Now  There's no difference  There's no difference  You know we  There may be a cultural entertainment  People may gravitate toward different cultural entertainment  But you could add a little Italy  And you're gonna have that  And nothing to do with the  Is he trying  Color of anybody's skin  Now is he trying to say that 
[01:20:30]  You could go to Little Italy  And get that kind of  That kind of treatment  And civilized  He's basically saying the Italians behave too  Is that it?  Yeah behavior  Yeah  The blacks and the Italians  Finally come around  Wow that bill  He really  Has his finger on the pulse  I'm sure  I'm sure there might be somebody  That stepped out of  Sparks Steakhouse one day  That might have a different opinion of that  What about Vitello's? 
[01:21:00]  How about Carmine's?  Oh Vitello's where you can get the  Bonnie Lee Blakely  Exactly  Umberto's Clam House  How about that one?  How about that one?  Civilized behavior  Yeah  Where they can have the Joe Gallo special  Ha ha ha ha  De Bruno  De Bruno  It's another fine establishment  That perhaps some shenanigans went on in  It's as pleasant as all the Italian restaurants 
[01:21:30]  Including the Palace Chop House  Yes  He doesn't have such jolts  Where he was murdered there  Bad example Bill  By chop they don't necessarily mean the meat either  Go around back you'll find the real meaning of the word chop house  Bill uh  Bill continues  This is what white America doesn't know  Oh thanks  Enlighten us  Enlighten us Bill  What do we not know that you are so knowledgeable of  As far as black people go 
[01:22:00]  Wow maybe  What?  White America doesn't know it  What are you talking about stupid  We're not surprised that  You know blacks run a restaurant  They actually lock the doors at night  And they open them in the morning  We know that  He's saying things  Like  That he didn't know  Yeah this is  Exactly  He didn't know this  White America  Knows it  You dope  It's not surprising  They have to feed themselves  And they do it like  Like we do  In restaurants 
[01:22:30]  It's amazing what these  Can do  I'm stunned  I can  Here's what you need to be surprised at black people  If you go to see the Van Halen reunion tour  Yeah  And it's 70% black in the city  You can go that is surprising  I'm very surprised at that  Who saw that?  Who saw that  White America didn't know that  Right  White America is not surprised  That when you walk into a black owned restaurant  That people aren't just food fighting and throwing things  Just slinging food and feces 
[01:23:00]  What did he expect?  Well that's his little closed off world  That's where he lives  He lives in that little entitled closed off place  And he's surprised  And we gotta make it perfectly clear  This Sylvia's is like as commercial as it gets  As far as going to a restaurant in Harlem  It's like tourist places  Like Harlem has opened up to a lot of people  As far as tourism goes  It used to be  Before Giuliani  It used to be very scary to go uptown 
[01:23:30]  Now Bill Clinton's got his office up there  It's a place where now tourists go  You go up there  It's where Whitey goes to make believe he's being brave  Yeah there are places you don't go  Right right  Believe me there are places you don't go  I don't care if you're Bill O'Reilly or not  But Sylvia's, the Apollo Theater  There are places up there that are tourist attractions  That people go to  Just say there's places where gentrification  Has not taken effect  Exactly that's what I meant  Those are the places you avoid 
[01:24:00]  Those are the scary places you know  Where they still have control of the streets  Wink wink Bill  We all know what you mean  Yeah  And Clinton being in Harlem has changed a lot too  Because the ex-president being up there  There's so many businesses and stuff have gone around  Yeah  All right let's get through this clip  So we can move on to Oscar De La Hoya next  Oh  Busy day on the O.P. and Anthony show  Won't find him in Iran  This is what a white American doesn't know  Particularly people who don't have a lot of interaction with black Americans  Like yourself  Like you 
[01:24:30]  The culture is dominated by Twista, Ludacris and Snoop Dogg  Oh and it's just so awful  That's what you thought Bill  It's just so awful  Because I mean it's literally the sewer come to the surface  And now people take it that the sewer is the whole sewer  That's right  Can I point out this self-hating black guy who's obviously talking  Yeah  Any black guy that goes on O'Reilly and just harps on how  It's a few bad apples that spoils the bunch  Yeah that's what everybody's  I'll tell you it's great  They used utensils in the restaurant  They paid for things 
[01:25:00]  That's fantastic  But occasionally just pop on YouTube  And put in convenience store robbery  Hey Bill  Have a little fun with that  Hey are you surprised that white culture isn't dominated by like  Like you know like heavy metal  It's like everybody knows that Ludacris and stuff doesn't appeal to people over 40  Yeah  Nobody thinks it does  You do  You know what the opposite of this is that annoys me  It's a commercial that I don't think a lot of people see as being extremely racist 
[01:25:30]  But it is reversed racism they call it  But I just call it racism  You ever see this commercial where it's a bunch of old white bankers  And there's one black guy who's kind of telling them what they should be doing  And they're going like  Give that much interest on savings  We'd never do that  And it's all  They're in a roped off area  And they're all old white guys  And this black guy is kind of like the 
[01:26:00]  He knows the deal as far as what people should do as far as banking and credit cards go  And all these old white people just know the old ideology  That's the same thing as this  Like that's the stereotypical what banks are all about and everything  And people should be amazed that it's run that way  But that's the same exact thing  It's Bill O'Reilly going into a bunch of black people  And realizing oh my god they're civilized 
[01:26:30]  Yeah  Like he's an explorer that went to Africa  And found a tribe that is using the wheel  That's pretty much the way he is surprised that they are running a restaurant  This is getting a lot of attention today  I want to be a little lighter to show them the secret of fire  Fire  They all back away  Oh  The surface and now people take it that the sewer is the whole sewer  That's right  That's right  There wasn't one person in Sylvia's who was screaming 
[01:27:00]  MF-er I want more iced tea  Please  You know I mean  MF-er I want more iced tea  That'd be hysterical  Al Sharpton's just screaming  More iced tea  That was his impression of a black restaurant  And I'm not talking about a KFC on 145th Street in the morning on a Saturday  This is Bill O'Reilly being amazed at what he said  A restaurant that he expected to go in there and see people yelling  I bet you he brought security and all that crap  Yelling MF-er 
[01:27:30]  I want more iced tea  Right  First of all it would have been Kool-Aid  Let's be serious  MF-er I want more grape soda  Everyone knows blacks don't like iced tea Bill  Wink wink  What's wrong with liking grape soda though?  Nothing  It's terrific  So after the cheese doodle appetizers  We all know what was on the dessert  That's right  We had Funyuns  Please  You know I mean  Everybody was 
[01:28:00]  It was like going into an Italian restaurant  What happened?  He almost said everybody was well behaved  Well behaved  He came very close to saying that  Listen to me  Everybody was  Listen to me real quick  MF-er I want more iced tea  Please  You know I mean  Everybody was  It was like going  Was  Almost said well behaved  It sounds to me like you were going to say well behaved  Was  Well behaved  That's what I meant  Not acting like 
[01:28:30]  Please  You know I mean  Everybody was  It was like going into an Italian restaurant  Was it?  In an all white suburb  In the sense of people were sitting there  And they were ordering and having fun  And there wasn't any kind of craziness at all  Hey where are the white women at?  There was no craziness at all  Craziness  People were sitting there and ordering  And did they hold the utensils with their hands Bill? 
[01:29:00]  How did it happen?  I took pictures and they didn't think I was stealing their souls  It was amazing  I cannot comprehend how somebody is so shocked that in a black restaurant the ordering system works the same as it does in every other restaurant  In a white restaurant  He is out of his mind  He's a douche  He really is a douche  This is some  Like I said before  Some of the most racist  Actual racist  Yeah 
[01:29:30]  See racism  On the surface  Especially with comedy  It could look like it's racism to these over sensitive people that just like nitpick everything  When it's just comedy based on race and racial differences and stereotypes  This is real racism you're listening to  This is a white guy who has no understanding of black people, black culture or anything  And feels superior  And is  He's professing his amazement 
[01:30:00]  That they are acting like white people  And he's trying to be endearing  Like I could see if he said I was surprised that many black people like the O'Reilly factor  I didn't think I had that many black people  Oh there's not one bit of this  Maybe  Yeah  Feeling  Wow that was kind of cool that I could go in there and people knew the show  But he comes off like  Everybody who came in  We walked in and everybody was just amazed  They were hooting and hollering  And banging in their chest  Yeah  The guy  He's just horrid 
[01:30:30]  He's expected to walk in and see like a white girl  Being sacrificed  Yeah  Like a favorite  Jacket  On a spit  Kevin from Connecticut  Craziness equals armed robbery  Craziness  And  Universal  Rimobo  Hmm  Wow that's a weird one  Okay  Mention the Opian Anthony Show at Sylvia's  And get a free glass of grape soda  There you go  Linger Lunger  There's an ass out there that hates when I say Linger Lunger 
[01:31:00]  Guess what that means I'll say it more  Alright there's your Bill O'Reilly thing  He's a lot of heat on Bill today  For being a dope  Hey before we go to break  We gotta let you know about CashForGold.com  Mmm  No I'm not feeling this one  Why did you play that?  Not feeling this one  Alright this is a cool song 
[01:31:30]  It's 80's  Wait a minute  80's New Wave Tuesday  80's New Wave Tuesday  This was a huge 80's New Wave song  No  No  It's the Opian Anthony Show  What's wrong Jimmy?  Whip It  Huh? What?  I called him Whip It  You didn't go with Whip It?  E-Rock what's happening?  Because E-Rock likes this song  E-Rock just talks into space  I know E-Rock what?  He said another song  Then we said no  I didn't hear Whip It  I'm sorry  You might have just ruined 80's New Wave Tuesday  Thanks a lot  Yeah right sure 
[01:32:00]  I finally felt like maybe I made a song suggestion  That the whole gang would latch onto  Alright whatever  Hey speaking of 80's New Wave Tuesday  Tim came up with a new sweeper for it  Oh good  Oh yes  I like the first one  I hope the singing's good in this  Uh well the first  Should we play the first one for a reference?  Sure why not?  And then we'll play the second one  Cause I like hearing Kenny in all these  I know  Sadie's New Wave Tuesday  You want more blood and love for me 
[01:32:30]  Do you really wanna hurt me?  Do you really wanna make me cry?  I am serious  And don't call me Shirley  A house  In the middle of a street  A house  In the middle of a street  Don't you want me baby?  Don't you want me?  Oh  It's 80's New Wave Tuesday  On the LB and Anthony Show 
[01:33:00]  80's New Wave Tuesday is just an excuse  To get Kenny to sing dumb songs  Yep  I can picture that big dummy when he's singing  Like the old guy and the godfather at the wedding  With the arms going to the  I'm angry  What is that?  This stupid suit jacket  Here's the new one Tim came up with for this morning  Let's 80's New Wave Tuesday  So it's sorta social  Demented and sad

Ring ring ring ring ring ring  A little plus one  And we danced  Swept away from our moment by chance  And we danced  And danced  And danced  That's 80's New Wave Tuesday  On the LB and Anthony Show  Here's the problem with that one  This should have been more Kenny 
[01:34:00]  More Kenny  Kenny was so awful  Kenny's the star  And Kenny came in here and he goes  Tim saved me  Cause I really messed up the next line in that song  And he saved me  That's what we want on this show  Yeah  You gotta get the outtake  Yeah, get the outtake  Yeah  I thought that was the outtake  Why would Tim save you?  The whole deal is to make you guys, you know  Sound kinda ridiculous  And anyone figure out the song Roland singing?  No, I have no idea what it is  No  Tim had to tell me 
[01:34:30]  It was a great 80's song  Listen again  The Wave Tuesday  So it's sorta social  Demented and sad  But social  We can dance if we want to  You can leave your friends behind  What's happening in the hostel?  Ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring  A little plus one  And we danced  Swept away from our moment by chance

[01:42:30]  What are you calling  Me for  Where are you  I'm good man  I'm back in  Back in Boston  Back in my old  Stomping ground  Oh you guys are  Shooting up there  Yeah  Here through October  Oh okay  Hey Dane  We can't keep  Track of you anymore  Movie machine  Jesus  You're a movie  Machine  Yeah  I mean you got  Good Luck Chuck  That's out  And it did very well  At the box office  Number 2  Yeah  And then I'm reading  About you  And it's like  This movie's coming out  In 3 months  Another movie next spring  And he's filming this one 
[01:43:00]  And then he's gonna film this  How many movies  Um  Yeah  But how  Yeah  Like how many  Alright how about this  Good Luck Chuck is out now  How many more movies  Have you filmed  That are coming out still  Um  One more  End of October  Steve Carell  And myself  And Dan in real life  And that's it  And then the one you're filming  In Boston right now right  And he did a cartoon  I did the voice  In Horton Hears a Who  And he's doing  Bachelor number 2 
[01:43:30]  Right now  Up in Boston  Which um  I don't know  If you got a tape  From New York  But I did what could be  Classified  As the worst audition  For a movie part ever  No  It literally  Tor Johnson  Must have sent a better  Tape to Ed Wood  Than I sent in for this  And I didn't mean  To be awful  But I sent in  An audition tape  If you or Barry  Got it  My apologies  For the 3 minutes  Of your life  That were lost  Watching that  Guy was awful 
[01:44:00]  I did watch  I did watch  Your audition  It was uploaded  Online  And the only way  I can describe it  Is it looks like  You literally  Just hung up  From the worst  Phone call  Of your life  And someone said  Action  The way it worked  The way I did the audition  For Dane's film  Is I went into this  And it was cool  Because Barry  Used to manage me  Who manages Dane  And I know these guys  For years  And he goes  Dane would like to see  You for this part  So I'm like  Okay great  But there was no one  Reading for it here 
[01:44:30]  So I had to go into  A casting director  And they put you on tape  So I had the script  And it took a lot longer  Than expected  Because my stupid manager  Was waiting for me  To suggest the casting director  I'm like  I don't know these people  So I went in  And they're like  Auditioning little Indian kids  For something  And then they call me in  And then like  Just kind of film me  And you know how  Casting directors read  They're terrible  They're all actors  That never made it  And so they're horrendous  Like  What are you doing  Yeah  And the only thing  Worse than her read  Was my read back 
[01:45:00]  It was awful  I shouldn't  And she's like  That was funny  And I'm like  It wasn't funny  I was horrendous  I'd love to see that  No you wouldn't  Next time Norton comes in  I'm gonna ask like  I'm gonna have like  Michael Chiklis  Read opposite you  Just to give you  All the  That would be nice  To have like a real actor  I'd just be more humiliated  Because like  I'm not a good auditioner  Or slash actor  But I  The shame of being  With a real actor  Probably would kill it  So Dane  Jimmy didn't get the part  Jimmy didn't get the part 
[01:45:30]  You know  I actually  You know  I personally  Put  You know  I asked Jimmy  To lay down  On the train tracks  Because I thought  He'd be really funny  In that role  And of course  I still am  I'm looking for  That perfect part  For you Norton  Thank you  It'll be  How about a walk on  Where I just walk in  And I just do something  Like huh  And I walk on  I don't have to say anything  I can just put my arms out  And just go huh  And walk out  That's already been cast  Oh Bob Kelly  How's Bobby doing  Yeah how's that on your coattails  That must be a big weight  To drag around  Quite literally 
[01:46:00]  Bobby  Yeah Bobby is in the movie  He filmed his scenes  He plays a  A guy who owns the strip club  We filmed in the centerfolds here  Dude  Yeah  Yeah I said  Dude  Look at the cross  Can I tell you the latest  On Bob Kelly  And I'm sure Dane  Obviously got the same thing  You got the invite  For his wedding  Yeah via online  Thank you  Yes  Online  I got an invite  To Bob Kelly's wedding 
[01:46:30]  I'm like that's really nice of him  And then I figured out  That it's an invite  To watch him get married  On the internet  Yes  What  Yes  I'll sit in the chat room  As the priest says  If anybody here thinks  His marriage should not happen  Please type now  Right  How weird is that  I guess he's getting married  In what Hawaii  On a beach  Somewhere on a beach  And you know  He's inviting his friends  To watch it on the internet  That way he can go in the water  And mate right away  Bob's afraid 
[01:47:00]  That as he's on the beach  Giving the ceremony  Someone's gonna come over  And splash water on him  Asking if he's okay  Trying to unclog his blowhole  That was my first internet invite  For a wedding  It's kind of interesting  Because it's the first one ever given  Right  No one's ever been as trashy  As Bob Kelly  As to go  Dude just send money  And then go to www  It's like you fat  So why don't you invite us  To the wedding  If we can't make it  We'll watch it  Oh Dane  He's got  You know he's got the iPhone  And I have the iPhone too 
[01:47:30]  So he's showing me  Some pictures of something  And it wasn't even  To show me pictures  It really wasn't  Because I don't even know  What the pictures were of  I didn't care  He didn't care  He then  While I'm looking at the screen  Hits recent calls  And that was his purpose  Just to see  Dane's name  Right at the top  Like you must have just  Talked to him  And he did that  And that was the sole reason  For calling me over  To look at the picture 
[01:48:00]  So he could then hit contacts  Like he just didn't mean to do it  But did it  And then it's in red  So I say  I go  You son of a bitch  I go  You did that  Just so I'd see  Dane Cook's name  On your  Just called you list  And he started cracking up laughing  I don't know how you deal with him  I don't know  I mean  That's just short of  Going to the mall  And buying one of those t-shirts  At that little cart in the middle  Yeah  I guess  I guess what we're trying to say  You gotta cut him loose  You gotta Dane 
[01:48:30]  Let him go  Let him go  You've done what you could  You've done what you could  Right  You've done enough  You put him on TV  Above and beyond Dane  He just takes any heat  And he throws ice on it  I can't  We made a life oath  Over a bucket of potatoes  At the basement of Remington  Wow  He's got  Alright that is serious  He's got something on you  What is it  Pictures  What has he got on you  He does actually  No BS  Bobby has some  Bobby has  Probably the worst  I did a photo shoot  One time  At Revere Beach 
[01:49:00]  Uh oh  And I will openly admit  These are the most  These are  These are like  Norton's auditions  These are the most  These are the worst things imaginable  You're not in fishnets  And women's panties  Are you  And boxing gloves  I've got the  Joey Lawrence  You know  Feathered  Oh nice  Yeah  I'm wearing like a blazer  Over a white beater  Oh no  That's cool  I'm washed jeans 
[01:49:30]  With my  With my like  Knock off  Back to the future  Two futuristic  Nikes  The ones that came up  With your calves  Yeah  And I'm trying to  I'm posing in the  In the water  I'm trying to pose  And it is brutal  Are you trying to look sexy like  Are you trying to look sexy or  Yeah  I'm trying  I think at the time  I'm  You know  It's just  It's bad  It's the worst  And I'm doing that thing  Where I'm like  You've got my back  And I'm looking over my shoulder 
[01:50:00]  Like oh I didn't know  You guys were here  Yeah  That's awful  I didn't know anything  About touch up  So I've got like  Back acne  And I'm just  There's nothing good  Happening  With those pictures  Why  You should throw those pictures  Up on the MySpace  Absolutely dude  That should be your  Your fans would love  To see that stuff  That would be funny  I might have to  Beat Bobby to the  Punch  On that one  We were talking about  Bad  Band photos once  When you're in a band  And every band has them  And for some reason  The drummer's got to 
[01:50:30]  Like hold his sticks  In one hand  In an X  And the singer's got to  Be out in front  Making like  And they all got  You can't look like  You have any sense of humor  It's all about the attitude  And then you look back  Years later and go  What a douche  What were we so angry about  Yeah I thought that was cool  All angry  My favorite embarrassing moment  For any drummer  Are all the early 80's videos  Like  I think these dudes  Thought with Journey  Where it was like  They couldn't afford  To have like  A real video  So they just put the drummer  At like a 
[01:51:00]  You know  At like a  Like a bar  And he's just  He's got a drum  On like a bar  Yeah  The ball  With like the hi-hat  And really rock out  It was like  That  There's a big Journey song  That's so embarrassing  Oh  Yeah I think it was like  Separate Ways  Yeah  He's playing like  The drums on a wall  Or something  Dude you've been  Hooked  Like really  Like pairing up  With very  Very attractive  Jessica Alba  Come on  Before before 
[01:51:30]  Now it's  I think  And Jessica Simpson  Kate Hudson's in the movie  He's doing now  Before that it was  Alba  Yeah and then Simpson  Like  So I have to ask you  Because everybody's saying  That like you  Were hanging out with  Jessica Simpson  You know  Come on  Were you actually like  You know  Were you banging her  Were you hooking up with her  I have to ask  My friend  Please  I mean  You know  We were hanging out  We were definitely hanging out  But um  No  No  Nothing  Nothing  Loot or lascivious  Was happening  At that time  I don't know if I believe that 
[01:52:00]  Look  Canoodling  Just  Just a good make out session  In the vernacular of the  Page six  Canoodling  I shouldn't have asked that aggressively  Let me ask  No no no  Please ask  Did she ever  Ask me in a roundabout way  Did she ever  Let me ask you  Did she ever  Jump out of the car  And go  And you went  I'm sorry  I told you  I  You know  I don't want to be too  I'm not going to 
[01:52:30]  Wilder  Wilder  Anybody  I can't believe  I said that  Oh yeah  But yeah  No  You know  You hang out  With these people  I'm a straight  American male  And  These are some  Cute  Cute women  So  If  If we can hang out  It's nice  If not  Then  It's all good  See  Just  Think of what you would do  What would Jimmy do  You're in that situation  You know  You'd probably  At least  Give it a good whirl  Give it a good try 
[01:53:00]  No I wouldn't  My self esteem  Wouldn't allow me to  Wouldn't allow it  Nah  My self esteem  Would step in  And just go  She couldn't  Want to bang you  So I wouldn't even  Give it a shot  I hope at least  She gave it a shot  Or threw out the vibes  And if they didn't come back  They didn't come back  It's kind of hard to compete  Against John Mayer  At the time  Who's got the large  I never realized  How big John Mayer's head is  He has a Stonehenge head  His head is huge  I got a picture of John Mayer  With my girlfriend  I'm like  When did you go to Ireland  And see this thing  Oh my god  That's John  Which means he's probably packing 
[01:53:30]  It's really true  It's true though  That old saying  It's like  The most beautiful women  You think that they're the ones  Who's got like  All the attention  They're the loveliest people  Do you think  People are afraid  To talk to them  That says a lot right there  There was some action  Do you think  It's because people  Like she's so hot  And she's Jessica Simpson  That people are afraid  To talk to her  So she's almost open  To be spoken to  That's the whole thing  Man  The opening  You know  The opening song  For any guy  They don't  They have no  I've seen it happen  I've watched guys  Talk to some of these  They have no  Idea 
[01:54:00]  What to ask  That's kind of true  Yeah  What the hell  Do you even say  And  That's the great thing  About being a comic though  It's like  You know we've always  You know  We can talk about  We can segue into  Anything about anything  And most of these chicks  Just want somebody  To like talk to them  Normally  Instead of like  Trying to throw  Some kind of like  Resume angle  Or I'm cool  Yeah  And they love it  If you just go up  And go  I just ate a hoagie  For lunch  And they're like  Oh my  Really  But how about 
[01:54:30]  If you follow it up  With a burp  And go  I'm sorry man  How about if you  Follow it up  With a burp  And go  Here smell  Blown in their face  Salami  And the movie  We've got a break man  Right now  The movie that's out  Is Good Luck Chuck  And it's with you  And with Jessica Alba  And you guys  Made some decent cash  Over the weekend  That's going to make you  Feel pretty psyched  Yeah man  I'm definitely  You know  Number one comedy  In the country  Feels fantastic  And of course  You know  When you're  We knew  When we made it

[02:01:00]  Whoever she's with  My hat's off to this guy  Sex looks ridiculous  Look at this  Just look at this guy  That's the way you should do it  It's the repetition of it  That just makes it look silly  If it was  You know  A bunch of different moves  But it's that repetitive  Doink doink doink doink doink  That just makes you look silly  Because if you did anything else like that  If you just sat here going  I'm just gonna bang my hand  I look silly  Wrong side of the desk though

[02:02:00]  Fat natural  What's the real one look like  The real broad  Yeah punch up a picture  So she's a body like Roland  I don't know  It was me  But it wasn't  A Roland sex tape  It is Rock Scream Tuesday  Let's get Keith in Massachusetts  We gotta do at least one a week  Keith what's up buddy  Hey what's up  Oh  Hey  Hey it's the kid from  The confessional booth  In Mansfield  Oh right on  Yeah  This guy did a great  Rock Scream  He doesn't remember you  Are you ready  I completely remember this guy  Listen to this Rock Scream 
[02:02:30]  If you don't think I remember this guy  Alright  This guy knows how to do it  Go ahead Keith  Let's go baby  Here it is  Oh  Wow 
[02:03:00]  Yeah that's alright  Wow  Yes sir Anthony  Yes sir  The phone messes it up  A little bit  But there you go  You sure have a lot of  A lot of breath  Hey if it is Meg White  It's a younger version of Meg White  Is that what you're thinking Jimmy?  No I mean she really  You think it's her?  Thank you Keith  That's a close one  I want to see the one  Eric brought up a picture of Meg White  Like you can see  Just like halfway up to her breast  She's wearing a  Very ample  Boostier shirt 
[02:03:30]  And then he's got the porn picture of her  Where her face is kind of freeze framed  But I want to see a shot of her full body  Like a real shot of Meg White  Uh huh  It's hard to kind of tell  If she's like  Is there anything with her midriff showing?  I don't know what she's  Because she looks skinnier in the picture  What a little fatty she is  I like that  She looks like Tala on the radio  Yeah  Uh huh  Yeah she's not a skinny girl  Oh she's a little blimp  I like that  A little pudgster  Like she's naked  She's like kneeling on the bed  And her arms are up or whatever  And you can see the belly roll 
[02:04:00]  Yeah  Which I'm not  Believe me  I'd have sex with her  In a fat second  But she's just a little chubberoo  There's a surprise today  What a chubberoo she is  Jimmy would actually have sex  With someone that's not perfect  Of course you would  Well if you saw me last night  You'd realize Jimmy would attempt  To have sex with somebody  Who's not perfect  Floundering zilch  It's okay  He's supposed to be  Laying there like that  It was awful  It really was 
[02:04:30]  Because it just sounded clinical  How you described it  No  We keep going back to this  What was happening was  Like I don't know  When you have sex  It's supposed to just be this thing  This natural thing  It just  It was  It was  When you have to have your woman  Sit there and try to calm you down  And say it's okay  Then maybe you should watch a movie  And maybe give it another shot  In a couple hours  It was one o'clock in the morning  My toes were pointed straight  I almost pulled two cab muscles  At the same time  Do you understand  My calves were locking up  My toes were like  Shaking  Shaking toes 
[02:05:00]  You're gonna get like  Like Nicholson's character  In Carnal Knowledge  Oh I thought you meant  Like Nicholson's body  In that photo  Recently in the boat  No  Sub sandwich  420  About fatty  Nichol?  Oh Jack  Yeah  I was thinking  Nevermind  Carnal Knowledge  Yeah  Carnal Knowledge  It's like  He got so into  So much like  Kinky weird stuff  That he couldn't  Couldn't really just have  Sex anymore 
[02:05:30]  It's very much like that for me  What I need  Is I need time down  From like porn  And stuff like that  Cause like  When I don't see my  When I'm not watching  A lot of porn  My girlfriend and I  Have really good sex  Cause then I'm like  Just like human again  But when I'm watching  All that stuff  It's so hard  To  To relate  Like without filth  Yeah you need  Some kind of filth  Yeah  Cause she's not  Pretty normal  You know  She's good in bed though  But she's just  Normal good in bed  She's not a  Filth bag  You ever take  A day off  From like  Taking care of 
[02:06:00]  You know  Yourself  Yourself  Not a day?  No Kate  Probably  I mean I have  What's the long  As you can go?  I mean I've gone  Two weeks  But that's  With a tremendous  Amount of effort  And that's like  Being very conscious  Of it  But I've probably  Done that like  Once or twice  Maybe two or three  Times in the last  Ten years  I mean it's every day  How many times a week?  Just you  Just me?  I would say  At least once a day  Like it's been bad  Like the last couple  Of days  It's been like  Two or three times  A day? 
[02:06:30]  Normally that's  Very rare  Usually it's once  Well that's probably  Why you have  A little bit of an issue  Usually it's once  And when you're  With your beautiful girl  There  Are you thinking  Too much?  Yeah  And I'm also  Again  When you're so used  To being by yourself  For hours at a time  And not allowing myself  To just move on  Because then the high  Is over  As soon as you're done  The high is over  So when you're  Keeping a high going  It's almost like  Smoking a joint  Like you don't actually  Finish the joint  You keep lighting it  Taking one hit  And stopping  That's kind of 
[02:07:00]  What it's like  It's like having  One giant bottle  A couple sips  And then stopping  As opposed to  Drinking the whole  Well it's always been  You reach  You go to the point  You go to the  Edge of the cliff  And then you  Pull back  And then you keep going  You keep looking  For different  Or newer things  And that  And then you go  To the cliff  And you come  And then you realize  Oh my god  Eight hours has passed  My back hurts  I feel like  Raymond Burr  I've wasted  Eight hours of my life  Why would that be a waste 
[02:07:30]  Well because  If you just would have  Done things  And gotten over with  You're talking about yourself  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  I'm a little slow today  It's like if you just  Deal with it  And then it's done with  You're not even  Going to think about it  Right  I'm not going to be like  I got to continue that  Then you can actually  Move on and do something  So your advice is to  Just jump off the cliff  Right away  Just do it  Just do it  Do you go off the cliff  Well years ago  I used to just  Like spend  Hours  Just hours 
[02:08:00]  Right to the edge  Stop  Right to the edge  Stop  Make a sandwich  Well not really  Make a sandwich  But uh  And then the second  You're done  You go like  What the hell  Was that about  Why the hell  Didn't I just  Get it over with  And maybe go out  It's a nice day  You know  It's uh  It's rough  It's horrendous  And then I go down  To the cellar  All like  Crazed up  Cause I've been  All day  Going to the edge  Of the cliff  And I'm like 
[02:08:30]  And then I'm in like  I gotta do something  Mode  I gotta do something  So I do my set  And I come back  And hours more  It's  I'm a junkie  I really  It's horrendous  Wow  Yeah you are  Jonesing  Jonesing  Non-acting  Little man  Get a rifle  Shoot something  Makes you feel better  Something should be shot  I'm sure I wouldn't  Though  I'd just keep  Loading the gun  And pointing it  And then not shooting  Is it  Is it  A barrel  Would point at the ground  Your girlfriend  Would laugh at you  It'd be like  Daffy Duck's gun 
[02:09:00]  Or whatever  Like where  Elmer Funt's gun  It would be like  Blooping over  Boop  Is it ever fun  Jimmy  Sure  When you're in that  State  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  Of course  But when it becomes  Addictive thinking  And behavior  Then it's not fun  It's not sexy  It's lunacy  Alright we want to  Thank Dane Cook  For calling in today  Yeah good luck  Chuck  His film was number  Two at the box office  And tomorrow  We have  Coming up on the  Opening  Of the program  We have  We have  Nikki Sixx

[02:12:00]  Party language  It probably wouldn't be smart  To talk about what we were  Just talking about  Nothing too big as far as  The listeners are concerned  But I didn't even want to acknowledge this guy  And I did  And I didn't say  I didn't say hi  I didn't say bye  You didn't say boo  And I didn't even  That's what I like saying  I didn't even comment  As he was doing his lawyer spiel  Because this is the guy  That we had a huge meeting  At corporate with a bunch of lawyers  Because we were really frustrated  About our radio show  And they kind of promised  That they would help us out  And like try to figure shit out 
[02:12:30]  And we haven't even heard from them  Since then  Should have mentioned the website  They just fucking lied  They got their agenda  And they can't see it any other way  Once they push it through  So now that I know that  Then we'll be okay  I'm not gonna attempt to  Fucking get anything done  With these guys  And then  I apologize to Tom  Because I'm like  Look, I'm sorry  But I just can't fucking stand that guy  And that's the truth  And we speak the truth on this show  And then I walk back into the studio  And I go

[02:32:00]  And it went a good  Nine inches  And he went  What the  Before he had hell out  Ropey cum  Was fucking  Soiling his floor  And rug  He probably ruined  His throw rug  With a ropey load  A fucking thick  Viscousy  Snot load  Ropey  Holy shit  It looked like  A fucking fire hose  Full of milk  And he couldn't handle  That challenge  To his sexuality  It grossed me out 
[02:32:30]  Completely  The fucking way  I ruined that  Throw rug  And the comforter  And a couple of shoes  That happened to be there  Just like someone  Stepped on his prostate  That thing  Hit up against it  And just  Shot it out  Yeah  It was like a fucking  Like a something  I don't know  What I can think of  That's better than  Fucking stepped on prostate  Perfect  And you step on a ketchup  Packet when you were a kid  It just flies out  Hey Bill K from Philly  He reminds us that  We used to play those  Rusty trombone songs 
[02:33:00]  On regular radio  By the way  Yeah  Although  And hence the bitching  About the lawyers today  Because I was telling Anthony  When we got back in here  To the lawyers  It's no big deal  They just  They take a little bit  Away from you  On this bit  A little bit away  From you on this thing  And it doesn't look  Like anything  Where you  You sound like  A complete asshole  If you go  Oh come on man  What are you doing  But then when you  Add up all these  Tiny little pieces  Fast forward  A year or two  And you realize  Holy shit  The lawyers are  Fucking up everything  Yeah  Derek what do you got buddy 
[02:33:30]  Hey guys  What's going on  Hey  Dude  I had my girlfriend  Try to finger my asshole  Last week  And I almost  Fucking threw up  Why  It was the most  Disgusting feeling  I've ever felt  In my world  What  Oh you never had  Anyone do it before  Dude it's fucking gross  I don't know how  You can stand that shit  Yeah  Terrible  Yeah  Dude  You know something  How come  When I go to the  Doctor  And have to have  The yearly physical  Where they  Check your prostate 
[02:34:00]  That is  There's no  Fucking  Pleasure  In the feeling  What so ever  No I understand  It's a doctor  I feel bad for you  Yearly  Let me get  Oh let me hang up  On this guy  Yeah but  I mean  I could give you  Strep throat man  You could get it  More than once a year  I don't  Think I need it  I mean I feel bad  For you  You know the yearly  To be honest with you  I really don't need it  More than once a year  Oh okay  I don't  Because my doctor  Said it many times 
[02:34:30]  Strep throat  And he's going in there  For whatever reason  There is no reason  For anyone to do that  Except a doctor  And when  When the doctor  Does it  It's like  This is not  Fucking pleasurable  Whatsoever  I gotta tell you too  My girl is trying to get me  To go to the doctor  And I usually go every year  Oh boy  And I refuse to go back  To the guy  Because last two visits  I had fingers up my ass  For some very  In the waiting room  For very  For very suspicious reasons  By the way  Yeah strep throat 
[02:35:00]  You shouldn't have a finger  I went in for strep throat  True story  And I had a finger up my ass  If you're a doctor out there  You figure it out  Because I couldn't  Unless he's  And now I haven't been  To a doctor in over a year  Because I'm scared  To go back to this guy  He's gonna put his finger  Up your ass  If he said  Why'd you finger my ass  Over strep throat  If he said strep throat  I misunderstood you  I  Sorry  I  The reason I didn't  Ask any questions  I know I've said this  Many times  But I was  Too busy laughing my ass off  When his lab coat  Got stuck  Oh yeah  On the  On the doorknob  And his  And he had 
[02:35:30]  The index finger  Up in the air  With shit on it  And he was trying  To get out of the  Fucking  Examining room  To smear it on his slide  And he couldn't  Get out of the  Fucking room  Oh  Oh  Oh that is so disgusting  And then he's going  Side to side  Like this  Trying to get himself free  Kind of like a  Chris Farley thing  You know  Trying to get the  Jacket off of there  Because he couldn't  Touch it with his  Shit finger  Just picture the  Chris Farley move  Where he goes  Side to side  Yeah  All awkwardly 
[02:36:00]  That's what the  Doctor was doing  Oh god  It made me laugh  So fucking hard  Oh man  You were just  Oh here's a bad  That's why it's a bad  Example  Because when you go  To the doctor  They also jiggle  Your balls  And they touch  Your dick sometimes  To check  And they're like  That's not pleasurable  It's like there's a  Different  Yeah but it doesn't  It doesn't hurt  No you're right  It doesn't  But I mean  It doesn't feel  Good either  It doesn't hurt  And even if the  Doctor  Let's say the  Doctor loaded up  That KY  He puts on his  Finger to fucking  Shove up your ass  And put it in his  Mitt and started  Jerking you off 
[02:36:30]  You know  It's not  You're not gonna  You're not gonna  Like it because  It's the doctor  And perhaps it's a  Man  Right  But it's still  Not gonna hurt  Like sticking a  Finger up your ass  Well you know  First of all  The doctor probably  Has bigger fingers  Than your chick  Your girl is small  You're not dating  A fucking  A Greek male  In his 50s  Big  Big mitts  Dr. Stepoulis  Is my girlfriend  With the fucking  Fat watch  And giant hairy  Greek hands  With the fucking  Manicured nails  Like putting a 
[02:37:00]  Gyro up your ass  The type of  Fucking Greek hand  That sculpts  Or anything  There's nothing worse  Than a Greek finger  In your ass  My doctor's got  The massive thing  Of Vaseline  And he'd loop  Vaseline  He loops that  Fucker up  The worst feeling  Is it just  Feels squishy  Yeah it's disgusting  Nothing  Nothing more  Degrading than  The drive home  From the ass  Exam  Because  Like you sit  In the car seat  And you're  You're squishing  Around  And then you  Get out of the car  And go in the house 
[02:37:30]  And you're like  I gotta go  To the bathroom  Change  I gotta wash  You gotta go  Take the rape  Shower  And you  You get undressed  And there's a  There's a wet  Spot by your  Asshole  Just of  KY jelly  Yeah cause he's  Not neat about it  No once he does  He just lathers up  The whole area  He just throws  You paper towels  And he's like  Clean yourself up  You're like  Wiping lube  Out of your asshole

[02:43:30]  So he gelled out  The window  Right after I saw you  I saw Wolf Blitzer  You saw Wolf Blitzer  Yeah  Walking on  Like maybe  Another 15 yards  On the other side  Of you  Was he  Damn  Yesterday  58th street  It certainly was  Sounds like a real  Hotbed  Was he walking  Was he walking  In a way  Like he was  Heading toward  The situation room  Yeah  It did seem like  There was a situation  Going on  Yeah  Yeah he's going 
[02:44:00]  To the situation room  You know what  Great about the TV guys  Is how much better  Their hair looks  Than ours  Yeah  Constant thoughts  About hair  If you're in TV  Yeah they're walking  Down the street  And you can tell  They're on TV  Just because  How their hair looks  You're absolutely right  Hey Ron  Was there a guy  Following Wolf  With a big boombox  Playing his music bed  In case he had to talk  Oh wait  We got situation room  Music ready  Maybe we could use  This for Ronnie B  I hate it 
[02:44:30]  That's kind of cool  Well now that we got  A C&D from Fox  Perhaps CNN  Will chime in  With one now  Yeah why not  For using their music  Now that we can't  Use the Fox  Stinger anymore  I'm sorry that  Jay Moore blew up  Your spot the other day  When you were being  An expert on our show  Yes we want to  Apologize for that  Ron  Jay Moore is an awful  Person we all know that  God forbid anyone else  Has a moment  Without Jay Moore 
[02:45:00]  Finding out  And the plugs  Oh  And you know  He's made Fez's life  Just a terrible mess  A living hell  Yep  He befriended him  For a moment  And then act like  The friendship was ruined  And Fez can't get over it  Yeah  And meanwhile  It was probably  Nothing to begin with  No it was nothing  Yeah  Now we want to get  Into something first  But I want to hear  Is Fezzy getting a cat 
[02:45:30]  No he already has a cat  He has a cat  Yeah  He got a cat  To make himself better  But the thing is  It's a feral cat  It was once a stray  On Roosevelt Island  Adopted  So he brought it  Into his house  And it's like  Having a wild beast  In your house  Yeah yeah  Oh that's great  Proving to everyone  He doesn't know  Nothing about pussies  No  Thank you  So thank you  Try the meal  No I think it's good 
[02:46:00]  I think you got  A real shot  Line of the day there  I honestly do  What the hell is he  Well I was going to say  What is he crazy with it  What is a feral cat  I know  I've heard  I don't know what it is  A wild  A wild animal  It used to be wild  It's brought in  It's basically  You ever see those people  That like to adopt  The crack kid  Like they'll say  I'm going to do something  For the world  And I'll adopt  The 14 year old  Crack kid  And then of course  They're shocked later  When all their shit  Gets stole  He thinks he's done 
[02:46:30]  Something good  And it's turned  Horrible  You know what they're  Like to those cats  You could be petting them  And it'll purr  And lift its head up  And you pet under its chin  And in a split second  It will put a gash  On you  It'll just  Slice you with its claws  And lay its teeth  Into your hand  For no reason  A little known fact  I adopted one of these cats  When I was in Buffalo  Doing radio  And know what I got  From this cat  Hundreds and hundreds 
[02:47:00]  Of flea bite scars  Completely infested  My apartment  I bombed my apartment  Over and over  And over again  The flea bites  Were driving me crazy  I had to throw  All my clothes away  Half my furniture  This cat gave me fleas  In such a way  I got the scars  To this day  All over my arms  You can't let them outside  It was a wild cat  That I decided  You can't let it inside  Need it to be adopted  It was a little thing  A little cute little thing  And I couldn't get rid  Of the fleas  By the way  We need that audio  The Bill O'Reilly's 
[02:47:30]  Controversial comments  On African Americans  There's a response  Or a baule going on  On CNN  It's Black Roland  Oh yeah Black Roland  Black Roland is on there  Talking  Bill O'Reilly  Actually ate up in Harlem  And was very  He was very surprised  That the black people  Actually ate  And ran a restaurant  Like white people do  Right  And he said that  On his show  He was very surprised  Hey Ron  Would it be annoying  If you called in  And we threw awful  Questions at you  Like so  Ahmadinejad  What do you got 
[02:48:00]  I would love it  I would love it  It's ready to roll  With anything  He certainly is  But we do call you  With specific reasons  And we got one today  Yeah  More Vince Champ  More Vince Champ  Black  Rapist  What else did they say  We were playing an old song  From one of the premier  Song parody bands ever  To grace the radio airwaves  Airsick Productions 
[02:48:30]  That's like saying Dave Kingman  Was a premier  You know  Hitter  He had some amazing  Home runs  But he also struck out  An awful lot  Well  Airsick is the  Dave Kingman  Of song parody  Airsick Productions  And we know  Paul is still out there  Doing what he does  But we have no idea  What's going on  With the more  Rotund member  Of Airsick  The Garfunkel 
[02:49:00]  Of Airsick  Garfunkel  Right  The Garfunkel  Billy Staples  What happened  With him  Well  The real  End story  For Billy  Is this  A couple years ago  He fell off  The wagon again  I know that's shocking  Yes  So  Ended up  In a car  I can't remember it  But  In a police chase 
[02:49:30]  Out there on Long Island  A chase  So Billy  Billy was driving  The getaway car  Oh my god  And it went straight  Into a telephone pole  That's great  As fast as his little legs  Would carry him  So  The easiest way  To put it  Is there was  A small  A tiny bit  Of brain damage  Oh okay 
[02:50:00]  So Billy  Is back  In his old house  With his mom  Same bedroom  He grew up in  I think there's  An old  Fated  Peter Frampton  Post  Is still up  On the wall  Frampton comes alive  Like one of those  Football  Like the long triangle  Football thing  With a team  With a team name  On it  Yeah  So  It's just  Kind of a reversal  Of the movie  Big  Where  Went back 
[02:50:30]  To being your child  So  And he wants to  You know  He  Still misspelled  Some things  Some emails  To me  And he wants to  Come in  But he can't  Come really visit  Because he has to  Take an elevator  To come up  And for whatever  Happened to his brain  It's not good for him  To leave sea level  So he gets very  Confused  Yeah  He can't leave  Sea level  That pretty much  Limits  His 
[02:51:00]  Travel  Places to live  Right  Well so does  You know  The money  Also limits that  Well  Yeah  And the fact that  He can never get  A license again  Oh my  God  What the hell  Wait Ron  Was he  Was he  He can't leave  Did he get vertigo  Or something  Yeah  It's like vertigo  But not exactly  So I mean like  Even coming up  To visit  Would be a problem  And  He's got to  Really stay  On the surface 
[02:51:30]  Of the planet  And this slight  Brain damage  Didn't affect his  Does already  Eat tasty treats  Right  Well I think  He's had a couple  More  Operations  Since then  Yeah  Oh Jesus  What would happen  If he came up  In the elevator  What would happen  Well first of all  Bad radio  And then  Yeah  He was ready  To fire that out  Before  Get him  He gets very dizzy 
[02:52:00]  He's very dizzy  Oh  Okay  Oh and he can't  Go over a bridge  Or through a tunnel  Yeah  Any of those  Things  Are a problem  He can't go  Below or above  Sea level  Sea level  Yeah  That's  So does he live  In the basement  Well that would be  Below I guess  Yeah  It's a topography  Problem if anything  Really  Yeah  That really is  Well I know  Fezzy doesn't like  Bridges  But that's a whole  Another thing too  Yeah  He doesn't like  Going over bridges  And he doesn't 
[02:52:30]  Like the tunnels  Or the subway  Or the cable car  And he moved on  To the retard island  Where you need  To take one of those  To get anywhere  Yeah  Brilliant  Yeah  So  I'm really sitting  At the cool table  With my friends  Aren't I  Just a really  The hip group  That I hang with now  Yeah  There are times  I listen to the show  And just go  Wow  You know  One of these things  Is not like the other  There's Ronnie  You know  Running the ship  And the crew 
[02:53:00]  Is just a mess  You're like  The gig  You're the  You're the cool guy  But you're  You're in charge of  The nerds  You're the Fonz  I think  I'm only cool  In that fucking group  I don't think  If I was ever  Around real people  I would be able  To function either  I don't know  Ronnie  People comment  On the message boards  And stuff  You're a pretty cool guy  I don't see it  But maybe  You got  Maybe you got 
[02:53:30]  To  You know  Bust out  No  The fact is  You know  If I got into  A situation  Where it didn't  Seem impressive  That you could  Take an elevator  I don't know  If I would do  All that well  I just think  I do well  With them  Yeah  I gotcha  So  What does Billy  Do for a living  He just lives off  What mom brings home  Well he's got mom  And social security  Is very very helpful 
[02:54:00]  I mean  Once you  Hit your  Mid 40s  I guess you're  Ready to call  It quits  Now doesn't  He also  I remember  He had  Some kind  Of relationship  Budding relationship  With his daughter  Years ago  Yeah  I guess that  Now went down  The shitter  Yeah  The last I heard  Of that  He had to  Sit in the  Back pew  And watch  Somebody else  Take her  Down the aisle  So he was  Upset about that  Oh no 
[02:54:30]  No  So she got  Married  He's the  Father  But some  Other guy  Who was more  Of a dad  Took her  Down the aisle  Yeah that  You know  You've really  Done your job  As a dad  When your  Daughter just  Completely alienates  You like that  Well she actually  Went to a day  Laborer  To have him  Take  You know  You pick him  Up at Home  Depot  Outside Home  Depot  They're like  Six o'clock  In the morning  There's a bunch  Of them  And the great 
[02:55:00]  Story there  Is Billy was  Upset because  He had rented  A suit  That day  Rented a suit  Not rented  A tux  Or bought  A suit  He went to  A place  Where you  Could rent  A suit  For the day  Where a mortician  Where the hell  Do you rent  A suit  Oh poor bastard  What place  Did he go to  The first floor  Suit emporium  Tuxedos  Up one level  Oh well  I'll take

[02:56:00]  He didn't need that  Well Mr. Bennington  There you go  You're an expert  At large  You're an expert  At large  We needed  Info  On Billy  Staples  And we got  We got it  That's what I like  About Ron  Vince Champ  Raped people  So just  You know  Sum that up  Yeah right  And when are you  Going to work it out  With Jay Moore  There seems to be  A little problem there  There's a problem  Between me and Jay  And it started 
[02:56:30]  The other day  When he  Fucked up my spot  So you know  Yeah  I was listening  On the way home  And you were  Talking about it  Just going  I just put the  Phone down  Walked away  Why joy  Being on here  Today boys  Remember  I'm baby  Fuck card  Holder number  One  So  Oh great  Here we go  Hey Ron  How's Lily  She asks about  You all the time  Oh 
[02:57:00]  Really  No  Yeah  She's being polite  She says she just  Feels so pissy  Once she sees you  Why she's always  Very nice  Yes but I mean  She just feels like  She just wants to go  I don't know what it is  But  But  What do you mean  Like we say  Like a lot of times  I'll say hi  And I think like  She'll walk by  She probably doesn't  Hear me because  She's very busy  No she says  That she's waiting  For you to make  Some kind of move  Oh  Are you going to  Make a move Jimmy  Yeah I already did  And she didn't  Respond to it  I showed up  In my  I wear my white 
[02:57:30]  Spandex or that  Underpants  And I just go  Huh  Your tent  Yeah  What do you think  Yeah huh  You want her to  Make sissy on you  No  Make sissy  Hey Ron  Congratulations on the  Magazine by the way  Oh thank you  It needs to be  Yeah  Talked about  Yes  One issue  One copy  Yeah that's  In circulation  It's in circulation  Though  Not to get  But worth it  Do you at least  Pass it around  To others  Or  No  I'm thinking about  Just keeping it 
[02:58:00]  In a dentist  Office  That'd be good  You just plop it  Down in a dentist  It'll become  A word of mouth  Sensation  We thought  You gotta go to this  What's that  I didn't hear what  Ron said  We really didn't  Hear you Ron  No I didn't  Say anything  He's just  Alright expert at large  Ron Bennington everyone  Bye Ron  Say hi to the gang  For us  Alright  Yep  Here goes 
[02:58:30]  Our new expert  On anything we really need to know about  Ron Bennington  That Billy Staples line  About the balloon would take off  And he'd just be standing there  On the ripped out bottom  Had to recover from my stupid balloon  Not leaving the ground line  That was borderline fucking childlike  But it was still  You recovered with a gem  Like you swung and missed  So hard  That you just kept going in the circle  And then you belted one off the wall  I don't know how you did that  I was picturing  I was picturing Peter Griffin 
[02:59:00]  When you said that too  Yes yes  Just sitting there  He does  Wow  Peter Griffin  And Billy Staples  A little bit  A little bit  Alright we're gonna take a break  We gotta get into the Oscar De La Hoya stuff  And by the way  I figured out who  Ahmadinejad's hair looks like  Oh who  Perez Hilton  But not red  But black  Yeah  He has fucking  Perez Hilton hairdo  But black  That guy Perez Hilton  What the hell's going on with him  He likes cock and food  In any order you want  Hair dye  It doesn't matter  I know 
[02:59:30]  Alright I got pee pee  Can it be on the best sellers list  If you have one book out  But it's bought  You sold out  Every copy  No I'll tell you why  Oh my  Because in order to become a best seller  And believe me  If anyone knows  It is simply  You have to have certain stores  That report to the New York Times  And there have to be  A certain amount of big bookstores  And independents  You can't just have Barnes and Noble  It's gotta be Barnes and Noble  It's gotta be Borders  It's gotta be  In different locations  It's gotta  And independents  Oh  What if Ronnie B 
[03:00:00]  Takes a cab all over town  And calls from different locations  With his book  No no it's not about calling  They have to report  And what about  Like grading on a curve  It's got one book  It's a sell out  Yeah but  If they  Say he puts it in a border  He just drops it  And someone buys it  Yeah  They can't then  Buy a copy that's gone  From a bookstore  Because there's no copies left  You could probably do it yourself  Go to the bookstore  Buy it  And then go to another bookstore  And just walk in  And go up to the thing  It's gonna cost you a lot of money 
[03:00:30]  And then you go  What is this  And you go  It's just a book  Yeah just keep buying it  It's just a book  Just keep buying it  In different bookstores  Yeah  You'd have one copy  Like from every store in the country  And they'd be like  This guy has a lot of slash no fans  Like he's really popular slash no one knows him  I wanna make Ronnie's book very popular  One copy  One issue  I haven't read it yet  I didn't care for it  I haven't seen it  You didn't care for it  No I didn't care for it  I thought it was pandering 
[03:01:00]  Uh huh  And I thought it was racially biased  Yeah  And I didn't like it  I'm sick of answering this  When is your video gonna be up  Because people are asking  Over and over and over  I'm sorry  I edited it  The follow up to the Vista video  Is gonna be up tonight  You don't yell at Stanley Kubrick  When Kubrick is ready  Exactly  Kubrick will do it  I don't rush these things  I might have to do a reshoot also  Why?  Literally  A reshoot  No  I  Well the side of the  The computer that I shot  Has like um  This rubber 
[03:01:30]  Uh  Round circle thing  That says Dell in it  And I shot that  Because you know  I was aiming  And I shot the  The rubber thing  And  The  The rubber  Kind of seals up  So the hole isn't very impressive  It came out the plastic  And kind of blew the  Plastic out  Which is nice  It took out a lot of guts  And uh  But the hole  Going in  Really doesn't look impressive  So what are you gonna do?  I might have to shoot it again  I have an idea  Yeah?  I'll tell you off air  Oh really? 
[03:02:00]  I don't even want to steal it  While we're tinkling  Okay  You'll like this one  I might shoot it from the front too  Does it have something to do  With the blacks?  No  No  No  No  Why would it?  I don't know  Geez  Talk to Ron for two seconds  And you're as racist as he is  What?  I don't know  I barely was able to say  It's out of here for me  Well we got some audio  From the  Tonight Show appearance  Hopi and Anthony  It's great  I like to have those guys on radio  Wow that's really nice  Really nice  Hopi and Anthony show  On XM satellite radio

[03:19:30]  How do you go out  How the hell  Do you go out  Just fucking  Annoys me  Because I'd like  To know  Like what was he  Paying her  To be there  Like if she's  Going to confess  Her own shit  About how  That's the worst  Oscar  How does he go out  He's fucking  With his bat wings  Sticking out the side  His bat wing  Is hanging out  He has ball bags  It looks like  He has my grandmother's neck  Sticking out the side  Of his fishnets  And I don't like  Can you go down  The little coy smile  He's got  Like the aren't I fresh  Yeah look at him  He's fucked up  He's holding his hips 
[03:20:00]  He looks fucked up  In that picture  Just fucked up  Here's what happened  She probably said  That was his camera  We're like  No I'll just put them  On your camera  And he doesn't  Probably operate  A digital camera  He's got people  Doing that  And she just  Kept a copy  Fucking bitch  Yeah she really  Fucked him over  That really annoys me  Alright  What are they  What are they  Like they got  A little white spot  Over there  Is he nude  In that one  Looks like  Paul Stanley  In that one  Fucking  She put a  Black star 
[03:20:30]  He was singing  Love Gun  In the hotel  The Black Roland  Just did a little  Something something  On the Bill O'Reilly  Thing that we were  Talking about earlier  Yes  So make sure you  Listen to the replay  If you didn't hear  It's talking about  Bill O'Reilly  Putting his foot  In his mouth  Going to dinner  In Harlem  With Reverend Al Sharp  Into a black restaurant  And he was very surprised  That the black restaurant  Pretty much ran  Like a white restaurant  Like a white restaurant  Amazing  The blogs are buzzing  Over Bill O'Reilly 
[03:21:00]  This morning  Controversial comments  About African Americans  Made on his  Nationally syndicated  Radio program  O'Reilly was talking  With NPR's  Juan Williams  About rap culture  CNN's American Morning  Talked about it  With CNN contributor  And radio talk show host  Roland Martin  Oh his name's Roland  But here's the deal though  And so  Okay  First of all  It's not true  Alright  I mean when you look at  You talk about ludicrous  Excuse me  I believe a Stanley O'Neill  Who runs Merrill Lynch  I believe a Kenneth Chenault  Who runs American Express 
[03:21:30]  And a Dick Parsons  Who runs Time Warner  Have a heck of a lot  More power and influence  Than a ludicrous  Or some other rappers  So I'm not gonna give  Some hip hopper  All that much cretins  That makes no sense  To me whatsoever  Okay  Also use your platform  Bill O'Reilly  To talk about those  Individuals as well  No  He's fixated  On rappers  Somehow thinking  That is actually  What black culture  Is all about  That's what doesn't  Make any sense to me  But what bothered me  Was when he said  That he was surprised  That there was no difference  Between Sylvia 
[03:22:00]  And someone else  Well why would you be surprised  Have you not gone  To a black restaurant before  I mean I don't go  To a Mexican restaurant  And somehow think  That there's a van  In the back  Stuffed with 20  Folks who just  Crossed the border  No  I don't operate  On stereotypes  I see that as a business  And I say people have  Napkins and forks  And knives  And they sit down  And they eat  But he was surprised  I think  O'Reilly told CNN's  Rick Sanchez  His remarks were taken  Out of context  He calls it a  Hatchet job  By the website 
[03:22:30]  Really the kind you do  Fucking jerk off  This guy's getting beaten  Savagely on television  Six black guys  Beat up a white guy  And Fox says  Police say the taped  Beating may not be  Racially motivated  To beating a victim  A new one  At least one of his attackers  Well then what was  Maybe it wasn't  Racially motivated  Don't know  If it was six white guys  Beating a black guy  They wouldn't say that  Yeah  Wouldn't even bother with  If he knew him  Didn't know him  How many he knew  Maybe he was just  Playing basketball with him  And he slipped out  And instead of saying  Nice shot 
[03:23:00]  He said  You know  Yeah  That word  Yeah  Oh another teacher's in trouble  Teens over age of consent  Oh okay  If teens over age of consent  Is it right to charge a teacher?  Charge a teacher?  No  She should lose her job  For some kind of moral issue  But she should be a  17 year old student  How old is she?  82  Wow she looks really good  For 82  82 
[03:23:30]  Oh look  They got O'Reilly Outrage  Of course CNN is all over this  Oh yeah  Run with it  Fox isn't talking that much  About it are they?  No  How does it feel Bill?  Yeah  How does it feel in the hot seat Bill?  What you were just doing your show  He was just talking  He probably didn't think  It was gonna do anything  And the beauty  It's on radio  Yep  It was part of his radio show  You know  Controversial comments  On African Americans  Stupid racist fuck  Getting what you deserve  Yep  Good 
[03:24:00]  Ah it's just gonna give him  Good ratings  He's psyched  Can't believe there's no craziness  Craziness at all  Craziness  We'll see what happens  He's so crazy  It's like why don't you just be amazed  That black people are actually walking erect  Yeah  Why don't you be amazed  That they sleep indoors too Bill  Amazing  Fucking snot  Bill O'Reilly is a fucking pompous snot  And boy  Did that story  About fucking him and the loofah sponge  Oh loofah sponge 
[03:24:30]  Sex call girl  I'd love to be interviewed by him  And the minute he got snippy  Why did that go away?  How much money did you pay?  Ah  He'd be like  Alright  We're through here  Unless you want to stick to the issues  We're through here  How much money did you pay  Scumbag  Can't say scumbag  On terrestrial radio  Because this is their reasoning  A scumbag  Is a juiced condom  Who fucking calls a condom a scumbag?  No one ever  Not since 1950  A scumbag is the girl you're fucking with it on  And me 
[03:25:00]  For lying  And pretending I actually value you as a human  I'm the scumbag  I don't know  Is this worth playing the OSU coach?  Let's give it a shot  What's his deal?  Well Mike Gundy there  Enraged at Carlson's Column  I guess this guy's name is Carlson  Old son of a Gundy  He did a column on former OSU  Starting quarterback Bobby Reed  That ran in the Oklahomans  Saturday morning edition 
[03:25:30]  Carlson made reference to Reed's attitude  And toughness  Gundy perceived the column  As a personal attack against his player  I'm not going to talk about football today  I'm not going to take a question on this game  I'm going to talk about this article right here  If anybody hasn't read this article  I don't read it  This was brought to me  By a mother  Of children  I think this is worth reading  By a mother of  Let me tell you what  I'm talking about this article  Children  Three fourths of this is inaccurate  It's fiction 
[03:26:00]  And this article  Embarrasses me  To be involved with athletics  Tremendously  And that article  Had to have been written by a person  That doesn't have a child  And has never  Had a child  That's had their heart broken  And come home  Upset  And had to deal with the child 
[03:26:30]  When he is upset  And kick a person  When he's down  Here's all that kid did  He goes to class  He's respectful to the media  He's respectful to the public  And he's a good kid  And he's not a professional athlete  And he doesn't deserve to be kicked  When he's down  What exactly happened?  I mean there must have been an article  I'm guessing it was a high school player 
[03:27:00]  College right?  OSU  OSU  Is that college?  Yeah  Do we have the article?  Or no?  The article  I don't know who's working  At this point Jimmy  Okay  Sorry  There's an article  I had to bounce  Somebody from there  There's an article that was written right?  What happened?  I don't know  It was some kid  Who seemed to be 10 years old  So I had to you know  Bounce  Of course you did  Bouncy bounce  Bounce him  And give him your own private email  So the uh 
[03:27:30]  Anthony at fisherprice.com  Fisherprice  So  Osh gosh  B'gosh  So wait a minute  There was an article written  I'm guessing about  Calling a quarterback  A pussy  And claiming that  The quarterback's mother  Was feeding him chicken in public  Oh  Was that a local sports writer?  Because the kid had a bad game?  I mean  Yeah  Sounds like it  Here's more audio  If you have a child someday  You'll understand how it feels 
[03:28:00]  But you obviously don't have a child  I do  If your child goes down the street  And somebody makes fun of him  Because he dropped a pass  In a pickup game  Or says he's fat  And he comes home crying to his mom  You'd understand  But you haven't had that  But someday you will  And when your child comes home  You'll understand  If you want to go after an athlete  One of my athletes 
[03:28:30]  You go after one that doesn't do the right things  You don't downgrade him  Because he does everything right  And may not play as well on Saturday  And you let us make that decision  That's why I don't read the newspaper  Because it's garbage  And the editor  That let it come out  Is garbage  Attacking an amateur athlete  For doing everything right  Good for him man  He's pissed  Fucking A  Well don't raise a fat  Pass dropping 
[03:29:00]  Fucking kid  Hey man  Teach that little cocksucker  To catch a pigskin  That's a good point  I stand corrected  Fuck that fat boy in his mouth  Mom should feed chicken out of her pussy  Put a drumstick in your twat  And feed that  Fucking fat nothing you raised  Is OSU high school or college?  It's college  But Oklahoma State University  That's a college?  Oh  He's a college student?  I swear I thought he was talking about  Elementary school  Because that's the only time 
[03:29:30]  That someone should have been that upset  About someone's child  Yeah I'm a little confused  Because like football guys  Football for the love of God  Are known for being pretty tough  To do it  Did the kid come home crying?  Yeah that's what I  I think if I was a player  I'd be like  Hey coach  Shut the fuck up  Hey coach  You're really making me look bad  That I'm dealing with on my own here  I don't need you to fucking  You know announce it to the world  Fucking kid  Crying  Kid comes out with fucking  KFC crumbs on his shirt  His greasy chicken eating fingers  He dropped the pass  Should be thrown off the team 
[03:30:00]  Then mouth raved  Talk about him crying  And you know he cries all the time  And he should be crying  Because I've seen him in the shower  He's got a small dick  Right  He's his white weight coach  You're going to attack  An amateur athlete  Who happens to enjoy  The company  Of another gentleman  Sure he takes a dick  Up the ass  Every so often  But he tries out there  To play ball  Do you know what it's like  To have a child  Come home  And cry  Dad I looked at another man's genitals  And mine stood up straight 
[03:30:30]  You don't have that in your life  You don't know how disgusting that feels  And how badly you wish  You'd kick that bitch in the stomach  On month three  You're going to criticize an amateur athlete  Who happens to like another man's genitals  In his mouth  While his mama feeds his chicken  So what  He can't catch a pass  He can catch a load  Like nobody's business  He can catch it  In the hands  Mouth or asshole  I'd like to see you do the same  Black  White  Chinese  Or Jewish 
[03:31:00]  He'll take anything  Any hole  Any load  That's why I don't read the newspaper  I use it  To clean the load  Off that boy's back  When he hasn't been able  To take it all  On his backside  But he tried  He does everything right  Wow  He's respectful  You take that cock out  He'll kneel politely  In front of it  He doesn't ignore  The balls or the taint  He goes right for them  People disgust me 
[03:31:30]  He's disgusted with the news  Blow up the kid's spot  That's funny  There's the angle  There's a little more  And then you want to  Write articles about guys  That don't do things right  And downgrade them  The ones that do make plays  Are you kidding me  Where are we at  In society today  Come after me  I'm a man  I'm 40  I'm not a kid  Write something about me  He almost said  I'm not a pussy  I'm not a pussy 
[03:32:00]  That'd be that fat boy  You wrote about  And the only pussy  Is his mouth  Cause he likes  The other players  To use it as such  That's his business  It's a new day and age  Ladies and gentlemen  You don't think  I want to call him  A faggot  Whatever he walks in  I'm not permitted  To do that  He dropped a pass  We all know  His hands were  Slippery with chism  And it wasn't his own  It was chicken  His mother had been  Feeding him 
[03:32:30]  And jism  His friends  Had been feeding him  Chicken jism  That's how he got  Ready for games  You can't downgrade him  Coach I got a question  Sure  Is it true that you're  Trying to make him  Into a wide receiver  I won't go for any  Tawdry humor  At the expense  Of the fat faggot  In question  You will not laugh  At his expense  Tight end sir  Is he a tight end  Or a wide receiver  I'll accept that  I don't know  I'm a 40 year old man  I'm not a pussy  Like  You know what I mean  You're a pussy 
[03:33:00]  He almost said that  I've never taken  The seed of another man  Into my mouth or ass  The fact that he has  And is obsessed with it  Is his business  And his mama  Who apparently  Cries to a lot  Cries like the bitch  That he is  Oh shit  Something about me  Or our coaches  I'm writing about a kid  That does everything right  That's heart's broken  And then say that  The coaches said  He was scared  That ain't true  And you know 
[03:33:30]  What else is broken  His heart  And his anal virginity  If boys had  Hymen's in their assholes  His was busted  A long time ago  He's doing everything right  Except playing the game  Cause he drops passes  Like a fat chicken  Eating faggot  That he is  We weren't sure  We were going to do  This story today  Fucking coach  Coach Jimmy rules  Do the players get shirts? 
[03:34:00]  Well most of them do  He gets a dress  And that's his business  He does everything right  Except catch the ball  And run with it  But he's good in practice  Oh he's always trying  To be the center  I don't know why  He said it's just  A comfortable way  To stand  And then to say  That we made that decision  Cause Donovan was 
[03:34:30]  Because he threatened  To transfer  That's not true  He's never going to  Transfer  He's always going to  Like Dick  He can't go  From dick to pussy  He didn't make that threat  Coach put me in  Or I'm going to  Start licking pussy  I said no son  I like the way you  Work your mouth on the balls  Go on in right now  Don't make no transfer  So get your facts straight 
[03:35:00]  And I hope someday  You have to  Get your facts straight  Cause he ain't  Downgrades him  And belittles him  And you have to  Look him in the eye  And say you know what  It's okay  They're supposed to be  Mature adults  But they're really not  And if you can't  Look him in the eye  Look at the back  Of his head  Cause that's how  I tend to see him  Look into his brown eye  Who's the kid here  Who's the kid here 
[03:35:30]  Are you kidding me  Jeez  He's trying to get all  That's all I got to say  Makes me want to puke  Unlike him  Who never spits it out  That kid can swallow  You think Rod Stewart had gifts  Makes me want to puke  Just the thought of that  Bleachy substance in my mouth  But apparently not him  Oh I got a tinkle  Are you ready for 
[03:36:00]  The line of the day  The line of the day  The line of the day  Is there an  Who gives a shit  At this point  CNN doing a story  On bad drivers  Might be interesting  Wow yeah  Actually the number one car  Yes  Yes  For what  If you drive an Escalade  You're a bad driver  According to this latest study  Ah  You know  That just proves my point  You drive an Escalade  No  You are driving  The way people should be driving  And you want people

[03:42:30]  In D.C.  Uh there's a lot of stuff  We're not allowed to do  What is uh  Elo just sent us  A video clip  Of Jenny Carlson  Responding to Gundy  Oh fuck  Is this Elo's  Favorite football team  I think he's a big  OSU fan  Oh really  So he knows all  About this shit  Oh okay  Where's the E to the low  Drinking  Alright what is this  Uh the mother  Alright play it  Hey Morris  And joining me  Is the Oklahoma  Sports Editor  Mike Sherman  And columnist 
[03:43:00]  Jenny Carlson  Jenny at today's  OSU Press Commons  You had a chance  To talk with  Football coach  Mike Gundy  How did it go  Well I got a chance  To ask one of the  Questions that I  Really wanted to ask  After uh Saturday  And uh  After Mike Gundy  Uh had what  A lot of people  Are calling a tirade  After the Texas Tech  Game  The question I really  Wanted to ask him  Was he he said  On Saturday  That the three  Fourths of what  I had written  In Saturday's column  Was inaccurate  And I really  Wanted to know  From him  What those  Inaccuracies were  What those  Statements of fact 
[03:43:30]  That were wrong  Were and unfortunately  I didn't get any  Answers uh I asked  The question the  Question was also  Asked by a couple  Other people in  Different ways and  Still we don't have  Answers to that so  That's unfortunate  Because when you  Contend that there's  That much wrong  With something I  As a reporter would  Really like to know  What was wrong with  The story with the  Column guys what's  The real issue here  Mike is it how  Much should college  Athletes be critiqued  I think that's part  Of the question  But I think Mike  Gundy really just  Had a hard time  With the tone  Tenor and question  That was asked  On Saturday  He expressed to me 
[03:44:00]  That he really  Didn't like the idea  That it was written  On game day  That it should be  About something else  The other thing is  Mike has had a hard  Time for a long time  Let's turn this off  Off the field  Criticist  Elo cares about this  And ten other people  Listening right now  Holy shit  It must be more  Entertaining to watch  After a few shooters  Who else  Anything is  Hey who else  Realized that we  Had to go to 11 today  Because we found out  Elo's actually  Working today  Yeah I know  How much does this suck  We were ready to  Punch out 15 minutes ago
