<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, featuring comedian Patrice O'Neal as a guest in studio, filling in for Jim Norton. The show began with a discussion about O'Neal's experiences with his VH1 show, *WebJunk 20*, his anxieties surrounding success, and his belief that complacency leads to failure.  This led to a discussion of disturbing internet videos, including a man slapping himself with various substances, a potentially faked vault launch video, and the Arbutt Dwyer suicide video, prompting reflection on the ethical implications of showcasing graphic content. The hosts also revisited past controversial segments, including one involving a crying midget and prank calls to funeral homes and an Alzheimer's facility.  A significant portion of the discussion centered on Anthony's past actions, particularly an incident at a Boston live show where he, while intoxicated, convinced a wheelchair-bound man to stand, resulting in a fall and nearly sparking a riot.  The hosts discussed this incident at length, along with their past guests like Wheelchair Fred, Lenny Clark, and Jack Black.

The show then shifted to a discussion of past on-air stunts and promotions that resulted in riots, including a chaotic club appearance, a "Catch Your Own Turkey" Thanksgiving promotion in Framingham, Massachusetts that devolved into a massive riot involving hundreds of people and damage to the show's "rock bus," and the involvement of Fred Durst in an earlier riot.  They recounted the "Wheelchair Fred" incident, and discussed their creative process, mentioning other stunts and bits like "Twitchels" and a now-defunct Oprah bit.  A substantial segment was dedicated to debating 9/11 conspiracy theories, with Anthony ultimately maintaining that the events unfolded as officially reported.

The broadcast then moved to a hypothetical discussion about grounding all flights to prevent terrorism, the psychological impact of 9/11, and the government's potential use of such events to justify increased control. This transitioned into a discussion of Al-Qaeda's strategy and the failed attempt to blow up jets in Korea.  The conversation abruptly switched to American Idol, with critique of contestants like Ace Young, Chris Daughtry, Paris Bennett, Bucky Covington, and Mandisa.  A lengthy and crude discussion about body image followed, interspersed with calls from listeners. One caller, Keith, sought advice on leaving his fianc√©e before their wedding due to financial and personality issues, receiving blunt advice from the hosts. Another caller, Mark Vestibule, engaged in a racially charged argument with Anthony and Colin.

The final segment largely focused on *House*, with discussion of its medical cases and the main character's personality.  This was interwoven with a prolonged comedic bit centered on mispronunciations of Michael Buffer's "Let's get ready to rumble" phrase, featuring input from callers. Anthony detailed his difficult marriage and its dissolution.  The show also included discussions of a commercial that misused music, a news story about a teenager being "teabagged," and an update from frequent caller "Lady Di" about her homelessness.  Audio clips, including one of Steve Irwin reacting to the death of a crocodile, were played throughout the broadcast.

[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:05:00]  Let me have a blue sandwich, Dr. Pepper.  Make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  For some reason or another,  who signed a little call on radio? 
[00:05:30]  You are rich!  I messed it up.  What we're dealing with here  is a complete lack of respect for the law.  I was trying to get too clever, Ann.  I'm sorry.  Oh, are you trying to mix, too?  I messed up.  Come on, everybody!  Wake up!  Rise and shine!  What?  What?  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Yeah, I can't touch it! 
[00:06:00]  Arrgh!  Arrgh!  And let's begin.  It's the Ovi and Anthony program.  Thanks for checking us out once again this morning.  All right, Dad.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Good morning!  From WebJunk 20.  Hello.  From the hit show.  I can't deny it. 
[00:06:30]  The hit VH1 show, WebJunk 20.  It's Patrice O'Neill.  It's Patrice O'Neill.  Good morning.  I enjoy WebJunk 20.  I enjoy it.  It's just I can't accept...  Anytime I get happy and try to embrace something,  anytime I get comfortable, it's over.  Yeah, doesn't that seem the way it is?  You gotta, like, keep yourself in check.  You ever have an internal dialogue with yourself?  All the time.  Like if someone else, and you tell yourself to shut up? 
[00:07:00]  Like, I'm constantly going like,  all right, this happens, and then, you know,  we do this, and then I go,  I go, shut the fuck up,  because if you talk about it,  you're gonna jinx the shit out of it.  All the time.  That's why people go,  hey, WebJunk, I go, ah, you know,  it's not like, ah, fuck it,  who gives a shit?  It's more like, listen,  don't ask me about it.  Do you know?  It's just a volatile motherfucking thing.  Right.  You in, and then you out, motherfucker.  Don't ask.  That's not the point, though.  Just before we went on air,  I said, yeah, 
[00:07:30]  I was talking about WebJunk 20,  and Patrice was like,  look, man, I've been doing this,  what, a third of my life?  This entertainment thing,  and he's like, it's a paycheck.  I'm like, you are such a liar.  There's a part of Patrice O'Neal  that is proud that he's on  doing WebJunk 20.  No, all of me is proud,  but that part of me,  the part when I go,  ah, it's just a,  it's like,  it's a way of staying humble  in my own mind.  It's a defense mechanism.  It's a defense mechanism,  because it's like,  comfort zone,  it's never good for me.  No.  It just never worked.  I would love to be sitting down 
[00:08:00]  and go, ah, delicious.  Yeah.  But it's not gonna happen,  so I just saw him.  You know, it sticks in my mind,  it sticks in my mind,  and I cannot get it out  every time I start feeling  comfortable in a situation  and happy with the way  things are going,  and things are going so well  and stuff.  So one instance,  back in the Comedy Connection  up in Boston,  seeing John Valby,  and we were talking about  somebody that had fucked up,  and he asked me  how things were going 
[00:08:30]  with the show up there,  and I was like,  it's fantastic,  it's great,  couldn't be better,  we're having so much fun  and stuff,  and he goes,  he goes,  remember,  pride goeth before the fall.  Like,  like,  don't be too fucking hip  on yourself,  and don't be so happy  with the way things are going,  and proud of what you're doing,  because that comes  right before the fall.  And I blew him off,  like,  fucking sing your whiskey drinking,  bitch fucking song 
[00:09:00]  with your piano  and shut the fuck up.  Fuck you!  And within a week  or something,  That's why I'm laughing,  because we were fired  from our fucking jobs up there.  John Valby was one  of the last things we did.  Last things we did.  And all I kept thinking was,  pride goeth before the fall,  pride goeth,  motherfucker,  I was telling him  how good everything was going,  and then since that day,  that sticks in my mind.  Anytime someone says,  how are things going with work?  Eh, you know,  you go in,  you do,  you leave. 
[00:09:30]  That's not when I get on planes.  I stay nervous,  because I think I'm supposed to.  Like,  I can't just go,  don't get to the point like this.  Ah, dig it, man,  I'm on a plane.  Hey, hey, everybody.  Excuse me, stewardess.  Yeah.  I'm always like,  no, ma'am,  I don't want anything to drink,  because it could fuck  with the weight of the plane  if you pour me a bottle of...  And I want all my wits about me  if I need to open  that emergency door,  and I don't need  to be the drunk guy.  And then you see the guys  that do, like,  the Washington and New York shuttle  every day,  they just get down,  hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, 
[00:10:00]  and it ain't something.  Open in the New York Times.  Yeah,  the fucking plane  is bobbing up and down  like a B-52 in flack.  And you just want to go,  motherfucker,  let me see my stocks,  or I got...  It's like,  God, could you look nervous?  And you say,  wait a minute,  I look at those guys  in the stewardess  when shit is happening  on the airplane,  and if they're not even  flinching,  I'm like,  all right, we're cool.  You need your peripheral.  You need your peripheral to go,  all right,  this motherfucker's not tripping out,  so I'll just pretend  Did you hear the fucking shit  from the stewardess 
[00:10:30]  on the plane  that hit the tower?  Not the ones that are  getting all the press now.  Are they playing all the...  No, they have played  phone calls  from various flights.  I've heard a few.  So, yeah,  there's a stewardess,  an Asian girl,  and she is,  right as they're plowing  into the tower,  and she's there going,  Yeah, well,  there's, you know,  a couple of terrorists  count about the four of them  as I can see here  in first class.  We've got two dead people. 
[00:11:00]  That calm as shit,  this woman.  That is why.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  That's one of the reasons.  Now you're taking  my only thing  that keeps me  from going crazy  on planes away from me.  You're telling me  the stewardess  is going to be like that  no matter what?  Yes.  No, that's what I'm saying.  No.  That they wouldn't be calm.  If there was ever  a survivor  of a plane crash,  Yeah.  Which there are.  That's the occasional  amount, yeah.  Which is, by the way,  off the subject, 
[00:11:30]  they ever tell you  why they make you  tuck your head  in the back of your seat?  Ah, to break your neck.  Clean up a lot better.  To break your neck.  To break your, yeah.  It's just like so.  I watched one of my favorite shows,  Mythbusters,  and they proved  that that is  one of the most safest  positions to be in  in certain types  of plane crashes.  Has there ever been  a survivor  of a fucking  major airline plane crash?  Ever?  Yeah, a couple.  A couple.  Very rare, though.  Especially if they're  plowing in the ground  of 500.  You're done.  You're done no matter what.  You could be doing 
[00:12:00]  cartwheels down  the fucking aisle.  The point to that  question is,  how would you ever know  how cool a stewardess  would be  if the plane's going down?  Yeah.  If she's like not,  Oh!  And she's running  up and down the aisle  like,  You motherfuckers  do what you need to do!  Yeah.  Or the bitch  jump out the window  with a fucking,  with a parachute.  Good luck!  There's a case  of a stewardess.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  There's a case  of a stewardess  years ago.  She was in her  jump seat  at the back  of the plane  when it crashed.  The tail section 
[00:12:30]  of the plane  cracked off  with her in it.  She lived.  The whole rest  of the plane  kaboom!  Get the hell  out of here.  Soul survivor  strapped into her  little jump seat  in the back  of the plane.  Anyway.  I don't believe  she would be  that cool, man.  I just have  feelings about  9-11  and some of that  shit coming out  now is really  bugging me.  We're going to  get into that  in one second  here.  I don't want  to lose  Mark in Jersey.  Mark, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  Hey, Mark.  I was listening  to Twitchell.  When you listen  to him on the radio, 
[00:13:00]  the shit that he says  and he's doing  in the background,  it's so friggin'  funny, you know?  But then I went  to Foundry  and I watched  the video of him  and it's like  so painful  to see him  do that.  I almost can't  listen to him  anymore.  You know what I mean?  He's cool  with the whole thing.  The video is hilarious.  Oh, the video.  I feel so bad.  He was slapping  himself so much.  I mean, I was dying.  I was dying.  I felt really bad  for him.  Well, why does it 
[00:13:30]  say on the phone  line here that  you thought it was  hilarious?  I think, yeah,  when I listen to him,  it's great.  It's funny as can be.  But I just,  no, you know.  So on the radio,  it's really funny.  If you see the video,  it's very sad.  It's sad to watch.  Oh, man,  I think it's even funnier.  I don't know, man.  Oh, when he's  slapping himself  with a pudding.  Those videos  are up there, Steve?  Yeah, yeah.  That is,  they just went up  and other websites  are starting to 
[00:14:00]  pick up on him now.  By far,  one of the funniest  things that's ever  gone down in the studio  is him slapping  the shit out of himself  with pudding  and pubes  and honey  and frosting  and ketchup  all over his hands.  What website  has picked it up?  The first one  to pick it up  was Gorilla Mask.  Nice.  I mean,  that's a real popular site.  They just picked up on it  and it's right  at the top of their site.  Maybe WebJunk20  will pick it up.  Oh, sure.  Maybe.  Maybe WebJunk20  will pick up.  We have a guy  with a fucking  neurological problem  and we want to  exploit him.  It'd be wonderful,  but they couldn't even  do the narcoleptic dog 
[00:14:30]  as good as it could.  Nah, they get a little...  It's sad.  They wouldn't do Tattoo  when Tattoo was  singing his song.  They barely wanted  to do that.  Patrice,  the show's about fun.  Yeah.  It's not about tragedy.  I would love  to do fucking  Twitchels  on fucking WebJunk  just to talk about  his terrific...  Just the tragic shit.  Why hasn't someone  done like  extreme WebJunk,  you know,  where it's the guy  shooting himself in the head,  Arba Dwyer,  and like some fucking...  That kid hanging out  the back door of the car 
[00:15:00]  trying to scare the guys  on the bicycles  and smacking his head  on the bumper.  I can't believe  that guy survived.  All that shit.  Give it time.  Somebody will put it up.  Max X WebJunk.  This guy has a problem  when he's trying  to scare some people  on bicycles.  Ouch,  that's gotta hurt.  WebJunk and Scream.  Max X.  That's one of the best  shows out though, man.  But the guy describing it  has no sense of  like any sorrow  or any...  Now, I understand 
[00:15:30]  a lot of the shit's funny.  Uh-oh,  there goes his eye.  Yeah, exactly.  There are shootouts  and it's like,  ow,  that cop took a bullet  to the chest.  That's gonna hurt.  It's like,  this one leaves  five people  dead in the streets.  They should've known  to stay out of the way  from a fucking  snowmobile  with wings on it.  You know?  And just,  like,  people are dying in it  and burning.  His friends try  to roll him around  and put the flames out.  He suffered  third degree burns.  Ow,  that's gotta hurt.  Next on WebJunk 20. 
[00:16:00]  We're fucking Max X.  WebJunk X.  There it is.  It's at the top  of the page  on Gorilla Mask.  Gorilla Mask what?  Dot net.  Dot net.  How is it labeled?  It says,  as a catchy thing  to get people to click.  As if a grown man  involuntarily and repeatedly  slapping himself in the face  isn't entertaining enough.  Opie and Anthony  Smother Lewis  Twitchell's  Santani.  I always forget  his last name.  Santani?  Santani or Santani?  Santani's hands  with honey,  ketchup,  frosting,  pudding,  eggs,  pubes,  and more. 
[00:16:30]  Click here.  Nice.  That is really cool.  And speaking of  Mask.  These websites,  what's the one  you wanted me to check out?  Because I did check it out  last night.  Oh,  Break.  Break.com  used to be  bigboys.com.  Break.com.  Oh, they changed?  They changed.  They got a one word domain.  What's the deal  with the video  of the guy  doing the vault?  Is that real?  Doing the vault.  Right here,  right here.  Show Anthony this  and Patrice.  Patrice,  boom.  The monitor almost fell  and it would have been  Hawk's Fall.  Patrice,  here's one for  WebJunk 20 
[00:17:00]  if you guys haven't  used this one yet.  Watch this.  I know this is...  Right?  Oh, yes,  it's radio.  I know it's radio.  We'll describe it  with magic like that.  You can check it out  for yourself later  or right now.  It's Break.com  and it's this guy,  he's running toward a vault  in some kind of  gymnastics competition.  Watch what happens.  Running, running.  That's fucking fake.  That is fake.  Come on,  how is that fake?  That is so fake.  How can you tell 
[00:17:30]  that's fake?  Because nobody can vault  that far  on one of those  wouldn't vault?  Well, they say  the vault malfunctioned  and he went flying.  How can it malfunction?  I don't know.  Play it again.  Play it again.  You prove to me  this is fake.  Anthony doesn't believe  anything.  All right,  but Ant's really good  at this.  You tell me  where it goes fake  on us.  All right.  Get the look.  He's running.  He hits the vault thing.  It malfunctioned.  What do you think? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, malfunctioned.  What did it do  to malfunction?  The spring system  went back.  It malfunctioned.  The whole thing  went back.  The top part of the vault  came off the base  and the spring  just completely.  I wouldn't think  that thing would have  the potential  to do that  no matter what  happened to it.  To launch you  across a room.  I don't think  it's fake,  but I don't remember  seeing this clip  on any sportscast.  No, highlight reel.  You think all  the sportscasts are going on.  Spanning the globe.  And look at this one,  people.  Amazing.  Patrice, you should  just throw that 
[00:18:30]  on WebJunk 20  and say,  yeah, it's real.  I was there.  Well, didn't you guys  put on the seltzer bottle  or the water pressure  flying guy?  Yeah, the Chinese  water pressure flying guy.  I watched Mythbusters  and they had tried  to recreate that  and they couldn't get  the guy to fly  two feet.  It was just,  it didn't fly.  First, they're not Chinese.  You know how  them motherfuckers are.  They're just better than  the Chinese.  The Chinese are good  at faking videos  is what it seems to be.  They're pretty goddamn  good at that 
[00:19:00]  faking video shit.  CGI.  Got a bunch of  George Rookuses  over there.  Hey, we got more info.  Industrial rights  and magic.  We got more info  on that.  Matt in Connecticut.  Matt.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yeah, as far as I know,  if you listen to the end,  they say like,  it's like a commercial  for something.  Yeah, some of these things  they try to pull off  like real  and they're commercials,  like people crossing the street  and get nailed by cars  and you can tell  at the last minute,  you know,  it's a three stooges dummy 
[00:19:30]  in front of it.  Yeah.  But did you listen  at the end?  I think they have  like a guy with a toolbox  and he like pushed  the toolbox away.  So you think that  it was just done  for a commercial?  Yeah, no,  it definitely was.  Oh, like he was the guy  that was supposed to  fix it  or he was sabotaging it  or something.  Yeah, oh no,  he just like messed up  because he's lazy.  I can't remember  what it was for.  I can't even know.  Okay, all right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, see you guys later.  All right, let's go to  Doug in New York.  Doug, what's up?  I just wanted to thank you guys. 
[00:20:00]  I get into work every morning  and the first thing I do  is get on break.com  and check out  my daily fix of porn.  As soon as you mention,  the whole website  just like...  Oh, really?  Sorry about that.  That's one of the...  Any more considerate  of your loyal listeners, okay?  All right, thanks, man.  It's one of the bad parts  of having what they call  an audience, dude.  Thank God when we mention  websites, they crash.  No kidding.  I remember for a while  we'd mention it  and the counter would go down.  How could that possibly happen? 
[00:20:30]  We would watch it click up  maybe four or five hits.  Hey, five people  went on this site.  All right.  We got power in this business.  Wow, look at us.  We're power brokers.  Cody in Indiana.  Hey, morning, fellas.  Good morning, Cody.  Morning.  I heard you guys  touch a few times  on the Arbutt Dwyer video  and maybe a couple days  before the first time  I heard you say something  was the first time  I saw it  and this guy  is the most selfish  fucking motherfucker 
[00:21:00]  and saddest dude  I've ever seen.  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to agree with him.  He puts himself in the face  so hard that it messes up  his hair.  Yeah, his hair flies off his head.  Cody, have you ever seen  the rap video  they made out of that?  No, I haven't.  It's fantastic.  I got to get my buddy Buzzy  to maybe mail me a copy.  He still has it.  You know, I've heard you guys  talk about it  and I've never, you know,  you've talked about it  in passing  but never heard  what you think about,  you know, stuff like that  as far as it affecting  the things that you've seen 
[00:21:30]  and stuff like that.  I can't watch it.  Yeah, me either.  It's really, really disturbing.  I can watch the rap video  that was made out of it.  They put that video to a beat  so you see his hair  going up and down  and then they forward  and reverse it  so it looks like  he's dancing almost  to the beat of the song  as he's shooting himself  in the head.  A buddy of mine moved away  and I left a message  on his MySpace  that had a little GIF file  of him putting the gun 
[00:22:00]  in his mouth  and then taking it out  and it said,  I miss you so much  I could kill myself  but I won't.  Oof.  Wow.  Car crash?  You know,  a little bit,  a little bit.  That clip,  things like the ogre-ish,  you know,  you've got ogre-ish,  I know Jimmy likes  going there.  Ben loves that thing.  Ben loves it.  I can't watch that.  I'll watch any form  of pornography  you want to show me.  I will watch it.  Girl, horse.  Guy, horse.  I don't care.  Guy, chicken. 
[00:22:30]  I don't care what kind of  sick, deranged sex  is going on.  Because you believe in death now,  that's why.  I used to,  I could watch a beheading  like it was an eight potato chips  when I was younger, man.  No, even as a kid,  things like that  disturb me.  My parents,  in all their infinite  fucking wisdom,  back in, I guess,  1967,  or whatever the hell it was,  68,  decided to take me  to the drive-in  to go see  Bonnie and Clyde  with Warren Beatty.  And I was,  how old was I, 
[00:23:00]  six years old,  something like that?  And I'm watching it  and I thought it was  kind of cool movie,  gangster thing,  a little gross and stuff,  but at the end,  when Bonnie and Clyde  just getting mowed down  and...  Oh, that's so fake, though.  I know, but dude,  at the time,  for six, I get it.  It's fake now.  For your six-year-old kid,  it's like 1968,  so, you know,  you're not...  This was before Star Wars  when...  That explains those eyes.  You're not used to seeing...  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  He's a fucking pussy.  I didn't know Anthony was a...  You're not used to seeing that shit.  Anthony's a puss.  We had gone to Arby's  before the theater,  or the movies,  because, you know,  the Comac drive-in  that used to be there?  There was an Arby's  across there.  And I just loaded up  on Arby's,  had my little puppy belly  all full,  and I'm watching.  And then there it is,  Warren Beatty,  and what's her name?  Faye Dunaway.  Faye Dunaway.  Get out of the car.  The little birds go...  Out of the bushes  where the gunmen are.  And then, like,  Clyde looks over at Bonnie. 
[00:24:00]  They look at each other like,  we're fucked.  Here it comes.  And...  Just machine on fire.  Their eyes getting shot out.  Blood.  I fucking went...  I threw my Arby's up  all over my father's car.  All over the Rambler.  It takes...  Every year you learn,  you put the Anthony puzzle together.  Here's the new part of the puzzle.  All right?  This is why...  During his explanation,  you can see what...  Anthony's a hopeless romantic. 
[00:24:30]  That's why he's very monogamous.  You're right.  He's romantic because...  Part of that story was  they looked into each other's eyes.  Right.  And that's what he pitches  for him and his woman  that something goes down  and they just both go out  in a blaze of fucking glory.  You're a romantic.  You're a utopian.  You're an ass.  You just hoped the world was better.  How do you do this show, Dave?  I know Anthony goes home and cries.  And praise the God  that God knows it's just a...  God, thank you. 
[00:25:00]  I only do this for money.  Like, Opie really enjoys  destroying a life.  He'll talk about it later.  Like, dude, I thought it was funny  when he just...  When he had pubic hair on his face  and his mother called in  and was crying.  It was hilarious.  Anthony's like...  When they looked into  each other's eyes  and it was...  Did you...  I'm thinking...  Did you cry on a slap scene in Jaws?  When the lady came over and go,  You knew my...  You knew it was a shark?  The little Kittner boy.  Did you hear that fucking... 
[00:25:30]  Did you hear that explanation  about the movie?  Yeah, how long did I hear it?  I saw his eyes.  And they warded up.  They're starting to blink  a little too long.  Like Pussy Booth from Shrek 2.  They...  Oh, is that adorable?  Anthony has feelings.  They looked at...  Did you catch that?  They looked at...  That was the part  that made him throw up  is the love.  The love that was destroyed.  It was metaphoric.  It was...  Because they just saw like...  Oh, fuck.  We've been through all this shit.  How do you feel about  the shooting scene?  The Sonny scene  at the toll booth? 
[00:26:00]  Did you throw up?  No, I was older.  I was older by then.  Didn't see it in the movie theater.  But that didn't really get to me.  Why?  It was worse  when I watched  fucking Sonny  get cut down.  Because it's just  fucking Sonny's a prick.  He starts to scream.  They shoot him so much.  That is one of the most  realistic gun scenes  I've ever fucking seen.  That is horrific.  Where he just gets shot  to the point  where he goes  stop killing me!  I'm dead, alright?  I just haven't fallen down yet.  I saw Bonnie and Clyde. 
[00:26:30]  They had the fake  tummy gun movement.  Yeah.  And the thing that pained you  was the love  that was destroyed.  Maybe that was it.  I didn't even realize it  until you're saying it now.  You just told everybody.  Fuck!  Maybe.  You know, I leave this...  I don't really have feelings.  Sometimes I leave this place  and I go,  alright,  we may have destroyed  a life,  but think of the joy  we have given  to so many people.  He always makes  deals with himself. 
[00:27:00]  He makes...  I'm constantly  having an internal  monologue dialogue.  Spiritual deals  with yourself  to say it's not so bad.  It really bothers him  some of the things he did.  But that was my angle  with my dad  because my dad  would call me out  on stuff that we did  on this show.  I'm like,  but dad,  there's a lot of people  that are commuting  and we're just  entertaining them  and they have  miserable lives  and they found  enjoyment in that.  So maybe I hurt  one person,  but I made  thousands of people  very happy that day.  Very happy.  One person  had to be sacrificed.  That's how I had 
[00:27:30]  to explain it to my dad  because he was like,  what is wrong?  Do you ever feel bad?  What's the...  Has there ever been  a time you went home  and went,  fuck.  Not,  fuck we might get fired.  Right.  There's been plenty  of those.  And I'll tell you  one thing,  Patrice.  Was that...  Now that you bring  that up quickly,  that overrides  any feeling bad.  The,  oh fuck,  we fucked up,  we might get fired.  Override.  That is an override  in my head.  I could give a flying fuck. 
[00:28:00]  The eyes go away.  The fucking feeling.  The awe.  All goes down  the shitter  when I think  my fucking job  is on the line.  The fire.  Right.  We know fire.  You're top priority.  Super Steve's  everybody.  And then you probably  qualified to fire like,  hey man,  you know,  Steve-O and E-Rock  gotta eat too,  baby.  We're responsible  for the lives.  To make you feel better.  But has there ever been  a moral one  where you just went, 
[00:28:30]  that shit.  Wasn't there one thing  that like in the studio  and we decided like,  oh my God,  there was one thing.  Patty?  Nothing?  I think it was,  was it the crying midget?  The midget we made  get naked  and she started crying?  That was close.  We made the midgets.  That was a close one.  I'll be honest.  Now somebody,  within an hour  after the show,  I was eating a steak  somewhere and drinking  some wine or whatever  going,  wow,  that was a great show. 
[00:29:00]  Lenny Clark wanted,  was it Lenny?  Yeah,  it was a porn midget,  wasn't it?  Lenny Clark wanted  a naked midget.  Opie knows the story  because he knows  everything that has  ever happened.  He's a walking  fucking library.  Honestly,  I don't know if  Lenny Clark was involved  but I know the story  was something like this.  There was a midget  and she was trying  to become a stripper.  She wasn't in porn yet.  You're talking about  the porn midget  that was really cool.  We interviewed her as well.  No,  I think I know  the one you're talking about.  This girl is from  Long Island or Queens 
[00:29:30]  or something  and she called Steve  or somebody  and said,  look,  I'm a midget  because we were talking  about getting midgets  on the show  a long time ago  and she wanted  to be a stripper  and we're like,  have you ever stripped before?  She goes,  no,  I haven't done anything  but I wanted  to maybe give this a try.  We'll set it up  where it's like a strip club.  Well,  why didn't you strip for us  for the first time?  So she comes in  and she's such a little thing  that she's standing  right on the console  in front of us.  We're all kind of  just looking up  at this midget.  Not only that,  this console  wasn't like it is in here.  You see,  we got a lot of headroom. 
[00:30:00]  There were a lot of  electronic shelving  and stuff  over our heads  so she was the only  human being  and I use that term loosely  that was able  to stand up,  completely stand up  between this shelving  and stuff  which was,  it made it hysterical  that she fit in there.  She was so short  and she's standing up  on the console  and we're all watching.  We put on some,  you know,  Motley Crue  or some fucking  cliche strip club music  and get her dancing  and we start like  telling her 
[00:30:30]  to take her clothes off  and you can tell  she's pretty reluctant.  She doesn't really  want to do it  and she starts  undressing.  Yeah.  I guess she got  her top off.  Yeah,  and she realized  this is just not for her  and this was a bad idea.  But at this point  we've been whipped up  into a frenzy  and you know.  So she just kind of  was like,  her eyes went blank,  Patrice.  They just went  to another place.  A whole nother land.  The land of Oz.  And we're,  you know,  kind of suggesting  she take her pants off 
[00:31:00]  and her panties.  You can see it.  Yeah,  and she like take  and she's just  in her panties  with them midget legs  and stuff  and the big  like top eye arms.  Big fat midget legs.  She got the fat  little bent midget legs.  All her limbs  look like little  baseball wiffle ball bands.  With that meat  by the knee.  Fucking cocktail  Frank fingers.  Oh,  God damn.  And then toes.  And then she's like  topless  and she's getting ready  to like take her pants off  and then she just loses it  and starts crying. 
[00:31:30]  She starts crying.  Says,  I can't do this  and we're just like,  uh.  She's like,  I know.  And she's trying to  cover up with that  little fucking hand  that looks like a muffin  and she's like  holding over her breasts  and trying to.  See,  that's where I,  I see that's how  I wish I was there.  See,  that doesn't bother me  because I could have  talked her  into not feeling that way.  You know what I mean?  Because she had a feeling.  Yeah,  but there's no fun in that.  But it's,  but see.  But your whole anger  would have been,  girl,  you're up there, 
[00:32:00]  just let go  of any dignity  you have left.  because you already,  being an obscure midget  who's thinking  about stripping  is way worse  than a stripping midget  that makes you somebody  for a couple of years,  bitch.  Right.  And fetish,  a lot of motherfuckers  have those midget fetishes  or whatever,  but that wouldn't bother me.  You know,  like,  Patty,  Patty standing there  looking like  Auschwitz  really bothered me.  Like,  she just  was a,  that shivery old mess  and it just, 
[00:32:30]  bag of bones.  And I know,  by the time,  you know when I  stopped feeling bad for Patty  is when she was,  and I'm talking about  the mousetrap thing.  Yeah.  Is when she was crawling  and you could tell  she was in it,  into the thing  where she was like,  oh God,  it hit my arm  and then,  oh,  what is that?  And I go,  okay,  she's doing it.  But just that nakedness  right there,  it bop,  that fucking got to me.  Yeah,  a little bit,  man.  You can't feel  for someone  that doesn't feel.  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you.  Jesus Christ.  My latest quote.  I know there was one.  I know there was one thing.  How do you feel  for someone  that doesn't feel?  He's,  see,  Opie has,  Opie,  whatever he made a deal with,  whatever force  he has made a deal with,  see,  he'll never get fired  from radio.  He'll always have a job  at radio.  You'll get fired  for two years.  It's like,  you're like,  whatever.  It's just a funny,  you know,  whoever he made a deal with  just was like,  oh man,  I'm joking. 
[00:33:30]  You guys get another job.  Like,  that's what XM is.  I'm fucking with you guys,  man.  Just fucking with you.  You got a job.  It's like,  you know,  it's like when you're not  motherfucking say the genie,  you know,  when you make a wish  for a genie  and they go,  I want to have  a big dick  and then the genie,  if he's an asshole,  he'll just make your whole body  a dick and just switch  eyes on it.  Never works.  It's like,  whoever made the dope,  he's comfortable with  the deal he made.  He said,  fuck it.  Right?  Obviously,  the only guy comfy  with the deal.  You're not comfy  with the deal.  I have my own ways 
[00:34:00]  of justifying what I do,  but I will never share  that with anybody.  I swear to God.  You know what?  You ever see  fucking Golden Child?  My explanation.  He goes into a room  and it turns into hell.  He sits on top  of a little mountain  and it's like,  I'll be right back,  baby.  He sits on a mountain  and he goes,  and the motherfucker goes,  oh, boo,  what happened today?  Hey, man,  we made a bitch  get naked  and mousetraps.  Oh, nigger,  please.  Don't worry about it, man. 
[00:34:30]  Shit, I did shit.  My explanation, Patrice,  my explanation is so easy.  Oh.  So easy.  And you go,  wow, that makes a lot of sense.  Go ahead.  I'll never say it.  Oh, man.  What's wrong with you, man?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Now you got it.  Would you even allow  anybody else to do that?  That would take down  all four walls.  Then the ceiling hits us  in the head.  That's right.  Fair enough.  But I'm telling you right now,  it is the easiest explanation  to this whole thing.  Is it a paragraph?  Is it a saying?  No, there's no saying.  Is it some spiritual thing 
[00:35:00]  or is it just,  no, it's just very simple?  No, no, it's beyond simple.  Is it something easy  like, fuck it?  Fuck it.  It's beyond simple.  Let's go to Mike.  Oh, I know what it is.  What?  Opens up the bank book.  Yeah.  Let me just get online  and check my balance.  All right.  All is right with the world,  motherfucker.  Let's see.  I'm starting to feel bad  about myself.  Let's check the bank account 
[00:35:30]  in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Check this one.  Which account will I check today?  Let me spin the wheel.  All right.  I'll check that corporate account.  I know you have.  Is it all worth it?  Things in your head.  You know,  I'll be completely honest with you.  There are times  and there have been situations  and I can't remember.  There's like one that me and...  Stop playing, Anthony.  It's so bad  that went out of your head.  You can...  By Anthony's...  Anthony is... 
[00:36:00]  That's why he stays in his house.  The world...  Motherfucker,  Anthony stays in his house.  It's coming together  after 17 years.  Mm-hmm.  It's because the world,  the weight of the world...  Mm-hmm.  You don't watch a lot of news  either, do you?  No, I watch a lot of news.  And it doesn't bother you?  It does bother me, yeah.  I would have thought  that you don't watch the news,  you don't come out  because even homeless people...  You want to give money  to every homeless.  You want to help...  Oh, my God.  You're making me...  It's too simple now.  Not simple, 
[00:36:30]  but you have a...  No, no,  your explanation is too simple now  because I don't fit into  the mold you're trying to fit me into.  I almost fit,  but they're like,  I can't get the arm in there.  What the fuck is it?  There are a few things  that make no sense  with this picture you're opening.  Homeless people,  I could give a flying fuck about them.  And Patrice...  I feel no guilt.  I get annoyed at them.  I dish out to the homeless.  Absolutely.  That's why you'll never understand 
[00:37:00]  this relationship  in this radio show.  Just when you think  you got it figured out,  you're like,  what?  I swear to God  when I see those guys...  So perhaps the staff  should dress in stinky clothing  when they go out  to dinner with you.  Yep, a little more complex.  Just a little more complex.  I'm not far away  from utopia.  I have some sympathy  for the pains of the world.  Yes.  I do.  I feel some sympathy 
[00:37:30]  for the pains  going on in the world.  You're like a middle-aged  Italian version  of the Green Mountain.  What?  Oh, I got flies  coming out of my room.  Here's the question today  and the guy just hung up  on us.  What's the worst thing  Anthony has done  on this show?  Because if you ask  that question about me,  there's a million  that come up.  You're the...  You are the...  He's done some  horrific things too, though.  I've done some bad stuff.  That you started?  There was a time  when we were in Boston  Anthony enjoyed  calling funeral homes.  Oh, right. 
[00:38:00]  And asking to talk  to the deceased.  Yeah, you know how  they list the funerals?  This is a funny bit.  And original,  god damn it,  thought this up.  You go through  the obituaries  and they list where  and when the service  is going to be.  So when the service  is there,  you call up  and whoever answers,  you go,  like,  is John Smith  there today?  And they say yes  because he's laid out there.  They think you're asking,  obviously you're asking  if the body is there.  Is John Smith there? 
[00:38:30]  Yes.  Could you put him  on the phone?  The silence,  the dead silence  that you just get  and then you get,  yeah,  he's there.  Just put him on.  I really need  to talk to him.  He's,  he's the deceased.  You get like this  puzzled fucking,  and we laugh  our fucking ass off.  We laugh  and laugh  and laugh.  The Alzheimer's home  that we call,  the, uh,  thing.  Oh, shit. 
[00:39:00]  That was your,  that was you?  Yeah.  Oh,  fun,  fun stuff.  Was that your idea  to call the Alzheimer's thing?  I don't know whose idea  it was,  but I,  It does count.  I did it.  It counts.  What do you mean?  When you,  when we called,  old Bill,  the Alzheimer's clinic.  Oh,  oh,  that is like,  hello,  thank you,  please.  You've heard this,  right?  No.  Oh my God.  Is it even on this version?  Four or three old bitties  at this Alzheimer's helpline  and called up  and just made them feel  so badly 
[00:39:30]  for this poor old lost guy.  You've never heard this?  No.  You've been with us for years.  Old Bill.  By the way,  someone is calling you out  saying that you were there  for the dancing midget,  Patrice.  Are you shitting me?  Patrice was there for that?  She wasn't crying?  That chick wasn't crying?  The one that stopped dancing  in the middle of it?  That chick,  and that's why  I don't remember.  It didn't bother me.  That chick was crying?  Dude,  we had to stop the bitch.  I was there.  Yeah,  we did stop the bitch.  I was there  in the fucking room. 
[00:40:00]  Holy shit.  Wait,  but Nicole Starr  might be the porn midget.  That sounds like  a porn midget name.  There's a confusion here  because we got to  get your fucking midget straight.  Nicole Starr,  the Nicole Starr  was one naked midget  that was on the air.  Yeah,  of course we've had  more than one naked midget.  That's the one I'm thinking of.  I think that's the one  he's talking about.  God,  where else can you hear  an argument  where guys are like,  well,  Jesus,  we had more than  one naked midget.  No,  it wasn't that midget. 
[00:40:30]  It wasn't that midget,  motherfucker.  I remember what midget it was.  How do you have  the arguments  over which naked midget?  I was at a midget.  I was at a midget  very early  in the time  when I stopped  coming to the show.  And that's what I'm saying.  It didn't bother me.  Yeah,  all right.  Nicole Starr,  the naked midget.  What's this?  A porn site midget  with morals?  I don't get it.  There's a thousand pictures  of this chick  without her pants on,  yet she gets all nervous 
[00:41:00]  around us.  Yeah,  that's the chick  that is an actual  porn star midget.  Yeah.  We're talking about  a girl that wanted  to get into stripping.  I wasn't there.  We brought her in.  Off the street midget.  I wasn't there.  We brought her in  off the street.  She awkwardly  started taking her clothes off  and then just lost it.  I wasn't there.  Started crying.  And someone was saying  that Colin Hanks was there.  Colin Hanks.  It was Colin Hanks  and Jack Black.  Jack Black.  Jack Black.  All right,  that was with  the porn star midget.  Right,  that was porn star midget.  All right,  see,  everyone's getting it confused. 
[00:41:30]  By the way,  two more guys,  we were talking about  this yesterday,  that no longer do the show.  Oh,  hell yeah.  Forget about it.  Jack Black.  You never get Jack Black.  Jack Black used to do our show.  He was plugging Tenacious D  back then.  That was it.  Jack Black would come in  and do our show  every time he was in New York  and we haven't seen him  in years,  unfortunately.  His biggest movie then  was that...  Act,  act,  act,  act.  He played the soldier.  And Tom Hanks' son came in  and it turns out that  he was such a huge fan  of the Opie and Anthony program,  he was getting bootleg  tapes of our show  sent to L.A.  And he came in, 
[00:42:00]  he couldn't believe  he was on our show.  And now he's blown up.  He was in King Kong.  He was in King Kong as well.  I don't think he's blown up yet though.  He's getting there.  He's in the shadow of...  Ah,  you never know.  Maybe we'll get him.  Nah,  we're done.  I think it's possible  to get Tom Hanks' son again.  Yeah.  I think so.  But maybe Tom's probably like,  look it.  Yeah.  Don't fuck up Da Vinci code for me.  Yeah.  Screw this hair like this,  I gotta fucking walk around like this.  I want it to work out.  This is the question today though.  What is the worst thing Anthony has done 
[00:42:30]  on this program?  I'm trying to think.  Some people are saying this.  I'm going to play this for Patrice  because he's never heard it.  But here's how I qualify  the worst thing though.  Mm-hmm.  participating in Opie's evil  does not count to me.  Oh,  no,  no,  no,  no.  But like Anthony,  you...  Some of the evil...  No,  no.  Some of the evil,  he's right there with me,  man.  I know.  He's talking about initiating.  I'm talking about initiating.  I'm talking about...  It's like gang mentality. 
[00:43:00]  It's like Opie might be the first one  to hit Rodney King with the thing  and Anthony's like,  all right,  fuck it,  I hit him in his kneecap too.  I'd rather use the Reginald Denny  explanation on this one.  I didn't know.  Yeah,  what if one guy hits him  with the fucking brick  and then the other guy  came in and kicked?  You're the dancer.  Please let me...  I'm the dancer.  I want to know  because every interview...  Opie's the guy  that laid the brick over his head.  Every fucking interview...  Sorry, Steve.  Every interview,  you know,  Opie's,  you know,  the bad guy.  You're always...  You're never an antagonist. 
[00:43:30]  I've never seen you  an antagonist.  Unless somebody's like  really a dick.  Right,  but that's the way...  That's the way it works.  What about...  Anthony the...  Thank you.  God damn it.  Thank you,  Derek from Massachusetts.  Uh-oh.  Anthony the faith healer.  Say no more.  Okay,  that was pretty bad.  All right.  All right.  The only time  we almost got killed...  That was at a live appearance.  The only time  we almost started a riot  was because of him. 
[00:44:00]  Wheelchair Fred.  I was pretty drunk.  My shit has never caused  a riot.  My shit has never caused  things to be thrown at us.  I got all caught up  in the moment.  We were at a live appearance  up in Boston  and we had a character  on the show.  He's been on this show,  Wheelchair Fred.  The guy had a motorcycle  accident years ago.  He sounds like he's  retarded.  He talks like this.  You can barely understand  what he says.  It's like his throat  was crushed.  His legs were twisted apart.  They put him together  all fucked up 
[00:44:30]  because he had no insurance.  Then he's in a wheelchair.  Matter of fact,  when we go to break,  Derek,  find the bit  Wheelchair Fred  taking a little dildo  up his poop chute.  Yeah,  that's always a fun one.  Gives you a little insight  on Wheelchair Fred.  He did it on the XM show.  He was so desperate.  We got him...  This is what I love.  I love this shit.  We got him naked  on the phone.  He staggered to his bathtub  with a dildo  and he did himself  in the bathtub.  Did himself in the dildo  because he needs sex so bad.  He's so horny.  We'll play the viral promo 
[00:45:00]  that has that  as we go to break.  So we were doing an appearance.  We used to do a lot  of these things in Boston  and the place was packed.  We'd go up there  and give away shirts  and shit  and have people come up  and show us  your fucking weirdest scar  for this fucking bit of shit  from the radio station.  Typical stuff.  And Wheelchair Fred was there  so we brought him up on stage  and now I had seen  Wheelchair Fred.  He didn't have spinal cord damage  so it wasn't like 
[00:45:30]  he was paralyzed.  His legs were just  so fucked up  that he couldn't walk  so he was in a wheelchair.  But I had seen him  at the station  get out of his chair  and steady himself  on the console  and kind of shaky leg  but he took his hands away  and he'd be standing.  So I thought  it would be great.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  Trying to make yourself  feel good.  No, no, no.  You can't even  That was my  You can't even record  how long he was standing  without his hands.  Oh, I know.  It was like this.  I'm not trying to say 
[00:46:00]  No hands.  What'd you say?  You couldn't even record.  No recorder that can record  as fast as he fell.  Point, 20 zeros  and then a one.  That's how long  he could stand.  But  The fractions  don't go that low.  But, you know  I had a few in me.  I had a few in me  so I get this idea  0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.  Now the people  didn't know this  a lot of people  thought Fred was paralyzed.  So I get this idea  So he was a known  Yeah.  Like radio figure 
[00:46:30]  on the show  known  to be paralyzed.  Wheelchair Fred  Thought to be  completely paralyzed.  Thought to be paralyzed.  A lot of people  misunderstood  it wasn't just  his, you know  fucked up legs  they thought he was paralyzed  you know  Christopher Reeve paralyzed.  Oh my goodness.  So I think  I get drinking some beers  with the excitement  on stage  we bring wheelchair Fred up  he gets a huge ovation  because people love them  and I get this idea  And he's wheeling.  Yeah.  They wheel him up on stage.  They actually  the crowd has to lift  the wheelchair up  and place it on the stage  Yeah, they lifted him  up on the front. 
[00:47:00]  So he's like crowd surfing  in his wheelchair  for a little while  and they put him up on stage  Now I'm thinking to myself  I'm thinking to myself  this would look really cool  because I've seen him stand up  if I do a faith healer thing  and get this crowd whipped up  and he stands  they're going to think  I'm fucking Jesus Christ  So I'm going  Fred, you want to get out  of that chair?  You want to get out  of that chair?  The crowd just goes with him  Yeah  And he's going  Yes, I want to get out  of the chair  He just goes right with you 
[00:47:30]  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  Falls right into it  Falls right into it  I'm like Fred  He goes right with you  And I slam my hand  on his head  and I'm like  Fred, feel the power  of Jesus Christ  flowing through you  I feel it  And the crowd is  I feel Jesus  People crying  Dude, they were freaking out  And his arms  Now grab his armrest  on his chair  and start shaking  His legs are shaking  And every inch  he moved out of that chair  The frenzy 
[00:48:00]  in this crowd  was un-fucking-believable  I got to the point  where I actually felt  like I was channeling  Jesus Christ  What kind of frenzy  like  They're going  They're streaming like  the average  like  Dude  You've been to our live shows  Wide-eyed  What was it  Like  Wide-eyed amazement  They thought this  motherfucker was paralyzed  Like couldn't move  And I'm here  holding his head  He's shaking  and now his legs  are working  He's getting himself 
[00:48:30]  out of the fucking chair  Wait a minute  And the crowd's going nuts  and so Anthony's going nuts  because the crowd's going nuts  But is it like  Opie and Anthony crowd nuts  or is it like  holy shit  It's like both  Church nuts  It's both  It turned into  Like you heard gasping  Like oh my god  Fred go  Everyone got caught up  in the excitement  Everyone  Especially me  Wait a minute  This might just happen  And you were just going  Bananam  I'm going up  I'm like  Fred  Fred you don't need  this chair anymore  Feel the power of Christ

[00:49:30]  We pull it away  He  He shakes  He wobbles a little  He goes to take a step  And falls flat on his face  Wait  You're missing  You're missing one detail though  He's very close to the microphone  That the lead singer is going to use  Right  With the mic stand  Right  So he has no wheelchair  And this was  This all took place  In less than a second by the way  He has no wheelchair  And he realizes  Oh shit  I'm in trouble  And grabs the mic stand  That the lead singer is going to use 
[00:50:00]  Thinking  You know  He could use that to support himself  It's not connected to anything  Oh my god  He goes down  You just heard like  Just  Like the mic falling  And him  And  And then  And then just feedback  From the  The microphone  And then  Dude  We're just silent  Dead silence  Dead silence  And then  And then  You'd hear like  From the middle of the crowd  Yeah  You'd hear like

[00:51:00]  Like I think  The WAF  Ice scrapers  And CDs  You didn't really establish yourself  This was a  Yeah we were doing pretty good  Let me establish the evil  That could  Right right  Yeah you're right  The potential evil  Hadn't been established  Yeah we were there though  So  So then there was dead silence  People were like  What the  The grumbling started  What the  Who the  And all of a sudden  Patrice  They started throwing  Winging everything  We gave out  Everything we just gave out  At the stage 
[00:51:30]  AAF keychains  Coming back at us  Which I'm thinking like  Wait it's a joke  It's funny  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  Why didn't you fucking go  Hey man I tried  The aristocrats  Ta da  But why didn't you go  I tried  It almost worked  If they thought he was paralyzed  Patrice  There was no talking  How come you didn't have  Fred get you out of me  It wasn't even close to working  Did you have to wheel Fred off too  Why didn't Reginald Denny just go  Hey I'm driving a truck through guys  Help him  Help me out 
[00:52:00]  Oh my god  Wait a minute  When you get hit in the face  With the nice t-shirt  You just gave someone  Thank you goodnight  See you later  How long from the time  The guy goes  Fuck you assholes  To just  Like you go  We have to get the fuck out of me  Spread like wildfire  For how long  Through the crowd  Try seconds  Yeah seconds  We knew we were in trouble  We went backstage  Went out the back door  Into our vehicle  And out we went  And puttered down  Routon  Bye bye  Do you remember the feedback 
[00:52:30]  From the next day  Like people calling in  Well that's where it kind of started  Because some people  We told the story  And thought it was  Fucking hysterical  Oh yeah  So we knew we had an audience  Out there  Yeah we went on there  And told the story  Just how it happened  Right on  See cause the club  Maybe fit  I don't know  200 to 300 people  So it was only 300  Of our listeners  That actually saw  How awful we really are  And then we went on the radio  The next day  And told it to  Who knows  But they didn't call  Like those people  Didn't call going  You fucking  High motherfuckers  Here's another thing  Here's another thing 
[00:53:00]  It was a music station  So all the fans  That came to the station events  Weren't just fans  Of Opie and Anthony  They were fans of Metallica  You know  They're fans of fucking  It was an Alice in Chains  Alice in Chains  Tribute band  Yeah  Alice in Chains  Tribute band was playing  So now it's fans of the music  Not necessarily  All fans of Opie and Anthony  Oh my god  You know  So it was just one of those  Situations where  Yeah  And they just start  Throwing shit at you  Oh dude  Talk about bombing  Yeah we gotta get out of there 
[00:53:30]  That's fucking hilarious  Ain't that a great moment  There was another riot  That someone  And you were the  The fucking  Mass and commander  Of that shit  I had nothing to do  Catalyst of evil  That's fucking horrendous  I had nothing to do  With that  That was a bad one  We also  I forgot  We started a riot  In Framingham too  Where cops had to show up  And we were with  Fred Durst of all people  Before he blew up  Oh yeah yeah  Another guy that used to be  On our show all the time  Before he blew up  Yeah  There's been a couple 
[00:54:00]  Well that story  Is really classic too  I know we're going off  On some crazy tangents here  But we decide to  Allow our listeners  To catch their own turkey  For Thanksgiving  It was like  Catch your own turkey  There was a lot of  Rural kind of  You know  Wooded areas  Around where we were  So we decided to  Get this big park area  And have a  Catch your own turkey  Promotion for Thanksgiving  It wasn't a real park though  It was like a wild park  Yeah  It was like a  Wildlife preserve 
[00:54:30]  It was just a huge  Piece of land  That they didn't really  Do much with there  In Framingham  Patrice  Right  So we went on the air  For a week saying  Hey  Coming this Friday  Whatever  You know  A couple Fridays from now  Whatever  We're going to have  Catch your own turkey  So we're going to get  A bunch of turkeys  We're going to  Distribute them  Through this field  And you can bring  Whatever you want to bring  Just no guns  And you know  If you can catch  Your own turkey  You know  You have a turkey  For Thanksgiving  Right  So people 
[00:55:00]  We drive up  In the big rock bus  Well the listeners  Called for a couple weeks  Yeah  Leading up to the event  Going  Can I bring a net  Yeah  Can I bring a gun  Like nah  You can't bring  No guns  Can I bring a baseball  Back  Can I bring that  So we're like  Yeah  Dude I built this thing  It's a fucking  Two by four  With some nails  Through the fucking thing  And we're like  Bring it  Just bring it  And come and kill  Your own fucking turkey  Well nah  Well there's the catch  This is the catch  Hence the riot  Okay  And that's what makes  This a really  Interesting story 
[00:55:30]  I was going to say  Provided by who  Turkey  It was all very  Turkey village USA  It was very calculated  The way we presented it  Now the listeners  Could have misunderstood  Yeah  The key to the story  Is we said  Catch your own turkey  And then we had  PETA involved  They were beyond outraged  The media's like  What the hell is going on  The listeners are calling up  With their homemade weapons  Can I bring an axe  Can I bring a lacrosse stick  Can I bring nets  Yes bring it all  We don't get the shit  And we're like  We're going to have to  Check with management  On the axe thing 
[00:56:00]  Because they're  Alright no  They're saying yes  Okay you can bring an axe  And this was actually  Played it up for a week  And this was actually  Scarier than the  Wheelchair Fred incident  Now that I think about it  Well because they got  Fucking axes  They got weapons  So now yeah  Pick it up man  We drive up in this  Huge rock bus  It was a rock bus  It was like  Motorhome  Huge  With the capability  To transmit from it  It was like a rolling  Broadcast studio  Great thing man  Big TV  Playstation  All kinds of fun stuff  In there  And we set up  Raise the old boom 
[00:56:30]  And start broadcasting  Start broadcasting  Now we have to  Make the announcement  There's hundreds  Of our listeners  All with crazy weapons  In their hands  Crazy  And we send them out  To find the turkeys  Like they're going  After Frankenstein  Yeah that's what it  Look like  No joke  Like they're going  After Frankenstein  Angry mob  And you know  When you do these  Promotions you know  We have all sorts  Of listeners  These are fucking  People who think  They're going out  To murder their own  Turkey  Patrice  Only people  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  This is how fucking  Why I hate stupid  Motherfuckers 
[00:57:00]  Patrice  Absolutely  Wait  Under the guise of what  Like why would you  Have to promote  You're gonna kill turkeys  And you go  Hey kill your own turkey  Keep it  Like what were you  In charge of the land  And the turkeys  These are just people  That wanted to kill stuff  Right  So that's who  We got a crowd of  A section of turkeys  Let me explain though  We have a huge audience  Obviously  This type of promotion  Got the crazy ones  Involved  Of course  Just people that enjoy  Killing small animals  These were the 
[00:57:30]  These were the crazy  People going  They're finally doing  Something for me  For us  And they showed up  Hundreds of them  Hundreds  Precursor to the pest  By the way  Yeah  You motherfuckers  The pests were born  In turkey hunting  Turkey killers  That's where you  Boy you were born  In turkey killers  Turkey killers  So I don't want to  Most people have figured out  By now  But I don't want to  Give it away yet  So we're outside  The rock bus  With our microphones  Looking cool  Like DJs 
[00:58:00]  Hey so  Hey rock DJ  You guys ready to  Catch your own turkey  And they're all screaming  And like waving  Their instruments  Of destruction  Should be about  50 yards away  From the rock bus  You guys now  Go  Go everybody  Go get your  And they're running  Like  In the known  The very popular  Framing hand message  Oh yeah  Turkey field  Yeah  Well we said  Turkey field's a  What the fuck  Is this  No that's a pheasant  I don't want no  Fucking pheasant

[00:59:00]  And they got the  Big paper kale  I thought you were  Gonna have them  Already dead  And I thought I was  Thinking dead and frozen  Not even frozen turkey  Here's the bit though  But we couldn't explain it  Cause it would ruin  The whole thing  You would catch  Your own turkey  Meaning you'd find  One of these paper turkeys  You bring it back  We give you a gift certificate  For a frozen turkey  At whatever the food store was  But they didn't even  Wait to hear that shit  One guy I remember  Coming back  Holy shit  Holding  Holding this paper turkey  Like Sergeant Hartman  Was holding  Private Piles donut

[01:00:30]  So we run back  Into the rock bus  The entire staff of AF  Right  And winter came early  That year by the way  It certainly did  So there was ice  And snow  All over the place  It was around  Thanksgiving  So up there  That is winter  Yeah okay  Ben you remember this  So listen  You guys were  Fucking geniuses  Framingham  Patrice  Patrice is from  Massachusetts too  Yeah he knows  We know  Turkey feels  Of Framingham  Don't say that though  What the fuck  Came up with this  Bruce  It was like 
[01:01:00]  Almost on the campus  Of Framingham University  Yeah  We didn't say that  We just said  We were gonna let  These turkeys loose  And you go and catch them  Meaning you know  We're gonna  There's turkeys out there  Right so  Yeah  So now we're in the rock bus  And we hear the first  Ice ball hitting the rock bus  Yeah big chunk of ice  Hits the window  We're broadcasting live still  Like true soldiers man  Now the freaking  They start breaking the windows  With ice balls  Yeah  Dude they're serious  We're in the back  We'll be back right after this 
[01:01:30]  Hold on please  There were different sections  Of the rock bus  There was the section  Where the driver would be  There was the middle section  Which was set up  For like interviews  There was a table  And a kitchen area  Then there was a  Instrument area  Where all the goods were  Is this like a school bus  Or a tour bus thing  It's a tour bus  Big tour bus  And then a back area  Which was like  Usually for swag storage  And fucking groupies  And getting chicks naked  And Fred Gerst is still with you  We interviewed him that day 
[01:02:00]  To be honest with you  I'm not really sure  He was in the rock bus  When the craziness started  Yeah I think  I'm really not sure  It really got bad  And how many people  About a hundred  Hundred  Yeah there were  Hundreds  Hundreds  Hundreds of turkey killers  Not all of them  Getting crazy  Obviously  But enough  A good majority  Breaking the windows  We're in the back  And now they have  These weapons too  So they start  Hitting the fucking rock bus  With their weapons  Shaking it  And they start shaking it  And now they're shaking it  Back and forth  We're in the back now  Under a table 
[01:02:30]  You're looking at that  Like chopping tires  So you don't drive away  I know  Yeah  We're in the back  You hear windows breaking  As we're trying to be professional  And still broadcast  Under a table  And we're screaming  Because we have a PA system  It sounded like a 911 call  No  Don't you get it  If you have a paper turkey  You get a frozen turkey  You get the frozen turkey  Please don't  A big  You get the frozen turkey  Get away from the rock bus  We gonna give you a turkey  Mother  We want the blood too  When that didn't work  It was just pure self-preservation 
[01:03:00]  Move away from the rock bus  Or you won't be arrested  You won't be arrested  And they were like  Calm down  Everybody will get a prize  Just calm down  Okay people  You've taught us  A valuable lesson  On hack radio  Okay  And unfortunately  The cops got involved  To calm everybody  Now  Disperse the crowd  So we could drive away  In a rock bus  That took about  $14,000 in repairs  Good times 
[01:03:30]  This was the station's  Pride and joy  This rock bus  Oh  It was their pride and joy  And we limp it back  To the station  Remember Otto  Used to like  Wash and wax it  And everything  People would  The whole station  Was so proud  Of the paint job  On it  The flat tire  Was going  The radiator  Pulls up  Well  Another promotion  Done  Poof  Looked like a bus  Going to a 
[01:04:00]  Grateful Dead show  It was awful  Oh my god  Yeah  That was where  We were really learning  You know  We were learning  Our craft  Because the one  That found a  Dude  Yeah  He came back  Dude what the fuck  What is that  And then we went  Uh oh  I wanted a fucking turkey  I want a fucking turkey  I'm trying to fucking  Test out my butt  You fucking  Actually it was  The learning process  Because then we realized  You can't do this stuff  To the listeners  You got to get them  On your side  And then do  To the other people  Other people 
[01:04:30]  Other radio stations  Now let the listeners  Enjoy what it's like  To fuck people over  Why are we beating up  Our own listeners  Right  And this is  That was the lesson  You learned that day  Like ball  Oh without a doubt  Like  Bing  Wait okay  Wait a minute  They love  These guys love us  Could you imagine  The listeners  In the bus with us  Looking out the window  At poor fucks  Going what the fuck is this  The listeners would love it  Being part of it  So then we brought them in  Was there no precedent  At the time  That said  Don't do that to your listeners  Was there any mentoring  That you guys had  I don't remember 
[01:05:00]  Any real riots  Like that  That were against  The hosts  We just didn't give a shit  Yeah  We just didn't give a shit  You'd think  We didn't give a shit  And they knew it  The management of the station  Knew it  But the ratings  Were getting so good  They didn't know what to do  Let's say hi to Greg  In Long Island  Greg what's up  Yeah hi  The only thing I hate  About you reminiscing  Or saying about  All of these  You know  Skits and everything  Is that  It's so difficult  For you  Or anybody  To come up with  These ideas  In the first place  And then you only 
[01:05:30]  Do it once  And then you let it go  And you know  Well you can't  Quite do it again  You can't do  You don't want to  Beat it into the ground  No you can't do bits  That they already know  The outcome to  Yeah  Right  If we do the turkey bit again  People are like  Oh this is the turkey bit  They've talked about  And honestly we've talked about  The turkey thing  Many times on our show  In the wilds of Central Park  Yeah so we  We come up with  Other bits all the time  I mean our Twitchels bit  From yesterday  Is going viral  It's all over the internet today  The video of him 
[01:06:00]  Slapping the shit out of himself  Just to come up with  One recent example  Is when you put  Stuff out on the street  And you're yelling down  At the ones  That were picking them up  And stuff  I mean  The stupid company  Was  I don't know  They were signing Oprah  So they got paranoid  And they took that bit  Away from us  So that's the only bit  By the way  They've taken away from us  I know we loved it  And we absolutely loved it  We're going to try  To get that one back  The lawyers got involved  I can't even tell you  How many bits  You come up with  That you don't even do  You know like  Like Opie says 
[01:06:30]  Oh you know  We could go down  To the theater  And do this  And do that  And go see the movie  And you know whatever  And then you never do it  Right  If I can be honest  With you though  If we went through  All of our tapes  Of old shows  We constantly did that  We'd bring up things  And go  Yeah let's do this  And then never did that  Do you understand  When you're a creative person  You come up with  Hundreds and hundreds  Of things you never do  Right  You just throw it  Against the wall  Think of your favorite band  You don't want  You know they came up  With all sorts of stuff 
[01:07:00]  That they never actually recorded  Because then they're like  You know what  I don't know  I don't know if that's  Going to be our stairway  To have it  You come up with a bunch  Of stuff  You do one or two of them  And you move on  And you're constantly  Coming up with stuff  But we'd love to do  The sidewalk thing again  Yeah  That'd be cool  But that's my point though  That you know  There's a couple of times  That you say  Yeah we had nothing  For the show today  That would have been  Perfect time to come up with  You know  You know sir  We you know  You're talking old school now  I mean we  I can't remember the last time  We've had nothing 
[01:07:30]  For a radio show  We've joked about  I'm saying you know  Maybe you had an hour  To kill or something  You know  I think personally  And I haven't even  Discussed it with Opie  But I could see us  Doing the 55 gallon  Drum challenge again  Sometime soon  Another perfect example  Sometime soon  Yeah  I think that'd be  A good like  Thing to do  We got a few ideas  Because it's clean  It's dirty  But I mean  It's you know  It's good  It's nice  See and he's referring  To like going to see 
[01:08:00]  Brokeback Mountain  As a show  And then  It just  It was just stupid  When we saw the movie  It turned out  You know  I didn't see the movie  It didn't  It wasn't really a movie  That you could take  A bunch of our listeners  To and it would be fun  Right  It was really kind of  A long drawn out movie  Right  It was a love story  Of the fuck scene  I mean our crowd  Would have been  You know  Laughing their asses off  I'll tell you a bit  We're going to do soon  Because we've been  Talking about this  In the back office  We want to get some  Desperate girls in here  That really need money  Really badly  Money snatch 
[01:08:30]  And a version  Of money snatch  Yep  Which involves  Mousetraps  Yeah  So I  We're going to start  Recruiting girls for that  In the very near future  We need the desperate ones  How about trying to get  A pregnant girl  To deliver on the air  We did it  We tried  But it never happened though  Yeah  We did it  And that was years ago  You could rehash that one  We did it  This is Captain  Fucking precise  I know  Jesus nigga  How much  Did you want  Alright  You know what I like 
[01:09:00]  Girl smoking cigarette  Out of Vag  Remember her  That was cool  That was good  You know what I like  Girl launching bottle rocket  Out of snatch  Danny's got a brand new idea  Danny  What did he come in  And run away for then  No he emailed me  This idea the other day  How's the bald spot  On your pubes  Well you know  I really didn't take  Too much off  Just a little off the top sir  Exactly  It looked like a lot more  Than it actually was  Just the frizzy split ends  Exactly  Precisely  I don't think you've ever  Shaved down there  His real hair  Looks like pubes  You ain't kidding 
[01:09:30]  Believe me  Danny's hair is dry  And ball sack here  That was Twitchell's  Twitchell's used Danny's pubes yesterday  And smacked his face  And then he was going  Danny would you like  To tell everyone your idea  Okay  Alright  Well I can't get enough  Of that deal or no deal  With Howie Mandel  Right  So I was thinking  We can get some homeless people  In here  And play something called  Meal or no meal  Based on the name alone  It's a winner  It certainly is  I mean obviously 
[01:10:00]  We wouldn't have  A million dollar prize  Instead the top prize  Would be a meal  At a nice restaurant  Maybe like the Red Eye Grill  Down the block  Is a nice place  And that would be  The top prize  You can't send the homeless  To the Red Eye Grill  Why not  It's fancy  Just give them  Money for McDonald's  But it's got to be like  Money for McDonald's  Can be a prize too  But one of the lower ones  Yeah  Well I was thinking  Even lower than that  Really  Yeah like you know  A can of Coors Light  You know  Well that's probably  They probably appreciate that 
[01:10:30]  So what would be like  The lowest prize  A penny  Oh like a comb  Or something  A comb  Something completely useless  Something that a homeless person  Wouldn't even want  Right  You know  A pair of new underwear  Yeah exactly  A pair of socks  Socks exactly  Well if Keith the Cop  Wants to play meal or no meal  With us  We could do that one  And then the top prize  Yeah dinner at a really nice restaurant  Cause that's like  A million bucks to them  They want cold hard cash though  I say you go cold hard cash  You know like  Like a tense spot  A tense spot  You gotta 
[01:11:00]  You gotta make it  The homeless guy's version  Of a million bucks  Ten bucks ain't that  Hundred dollars  Hundred ain't that  Hundred's that  Hundred's that  A night  At the  Four Seasons  They're not gonna  They don't want that crap  Yeah that's the thing  About meal  They  They don't want that shit  You ever try to give a homeless person food  They get managed  Get the fuck out of here  Man my stomach's all tore up  Maybe  Maybe 
[01:11:30]  Maybe  Don  Mary  Don Perrion  Like a  Really good  Good  Bottle  Of  That doesn't even matter  To a homeless guy  I'm telling you  Their stomach has to  Like being  After you drinking  Fucking  Manischewitz  If you're drinking  If you drink like  Some great champagne  It's like  Your stomach must be like  It might up their  They want  Their pride  And they might want to  Just drink that  Now I'm gonna have to get a job  So I can afford this good stuff  You never know  They want cold hard cash  Or alcohol  That's it  Not expensive alcohol

[01:22:30]  Yep  No sign of them  Titanium  Bullshit  They found them  There's pictures  There's fucking evidence  No  Bullshit  That thing you watch  Is full of just  Fabricated bullshit  Bullshit  Here's a picture  They found  Pieces of the engine  Do you know  I personally  Looked at the  Photographic evidence  Not just fucking  Photographic evidence  From the pentagon  Engine sections  They match  The engines  Of a 757 blueprint  Which I personally  Looked at  Ready 
[01:23:00]  No  There was no  First of all  Where did that plane go then  I'm gonna tell you  Why it opens  Why I'm open to  Think  All right  It might have been  Conspiracy  Okay  Because we'll go  Back and forth  With  You know  Your pictures  My pictures  This and the other  Your pictures  Are bullshit  Why is your pictures  Real  Because I have  20,000 pictures  That show  Different angles  Different everything  And  Not  Not the wing marks  Covered by the foam  From the firefighters  Oh yeah  The picture  The picture you looked at  There are wing imprints 
[01:23:30]  And there's no fucking wing  That goes through the building  Yes there are  There are  Do we can't argue  When you're saying there are  And I'm saying there isn't  Patrice  Your pictures show it  With the firefighter  Foam in the way  I can tell you  Why I believe  It could be  Okay  And there's the only  There's the only thing  That the government  Could have something to do with it  All right  Go ahead  Okay  I am willing to listen  To get into  A fictitious  I use  Fat boys term  To get into a war 
[01:24:00]  That you know is bullshit  And we're starting to believe  That this is a bullshit war  Aren't we  The Iraqi war  The Iraqi war  The Afghani war  No  The  Iraqi war  Bullshit  Bullshit  To get into a bullshit ass  What's the only way  You can really  Justify  The whole country  Backing you  To get into  A fucked up war  Now it happened  In World War 2  By the way  Not only wars  We've been in  That I know about  I don't know how  World War 1  How we got into that  But World War 2  We were not gonna get 
[01:24:30]  Remember the main  We were not gonna get  Into World War 2  Yes  Until  Until  The fucking Japs hit  Now the Jews  Were getting killed  For  About two  Two to three years  Before we even got involved  In World War 2  Right  And we weren't gonna  We wasn't gonna get involved  Until the Japs  Killed  2,500 soldiers  Yeah  Which made the country  Galvanized to go  Fuck it  We're gonna  We're in this  How other  What other way  Historically  Unless we're involved  With the Russians  And all the other wars 
[01:25:00]  Were in  Every other war  After World War 2  Was just us  Being involved  With the Russians  Meaning  It was all  Commies  It was us  Not fighting  It was really  A war between us  And Russia  But we were using  Other motherfuckers  We can't fight each other  That was Afghani war  That was Korean war  That was Vietnam  Yeah  All of that bullshit  But the next  This war here  The only way  That we  We would be able  That the president  Or whatever  Would be able to justify  Going into Iraq  Right  The way we  We did it  Was if the whole country 
[01:25:30]  Was fucked up  Over some event  So I'm just saying  Not to offend  Anybody's family  But I'm saying  That I think  Maybe  The 3,000 people  That died  During that  During World Trade Center  Was collateral damage  So that they can  Justify going to war  And  WMDs  Right  What's that?  Weapons of mass destruction  There was the reason  WMDs  But they had the  Now  Wait  Look what they're doing  In Iran right now 
[01:26:00]  Right  Right  See what I do  The easy  The easy  How easy it is  For them to go  Uh oh  These motherfuckers  Are the new motherfuckers  Right  With 9-11 as a backdrop  To our fear  Uh huh  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Well 9-11's always going to be  A backdrop to the fear  Right  You're right there  But  We could have gone into Iraq  At any moment  We had been  Do you realize  Since the first  Not with the backing  Of the country  Yes  With the enough backing  No  And let me tell you  Something else  But the country's like 
[01:26:30]  What the fuck now?  Let me tell you  A little secret  Go ahead  We don't need  The fucking backing  Of the country  To go to war  In this country  You do  No you don't  You fucking  No you don't  You need a reason  To go to war  You need a reason  You don't need  The backing of the country  They didn't go into  World War 2  They had a reason  The fucking English  This is why the English  Hate us to this day  Cause we didn't go into  World War 2  We wanted to stay out of it  We wanted to stay out of it  We wanted to stay out of it  We're not business  And we think  And we think that  We saved them  English is like  Fuck America  Cause you  You didn't come  When we needed you  You came with  On your  With your own agenda  But they wouldn't  Go in there 
[01:27:00]  Because  Roosevelt  Right  Yeah  Says  If we go to war  And people think  We're going to war  They're not gonna stand  For us going to war  To protect Jews  That's Roosevelt  But  That's his feeling  That's not every president  We can't go into war  For bullshit  So we have to make some  We  It's possible  And again  And Osama Bin Laden  Takes responsibility  For everything he does  Didn't take responsibility  For the fucking planes  He absolutely  Never did  Bullshit 
[01:27:30]  He did  He never said  I had something to do  With that  He said  Fuck it  Good job  Whoever fucking did it  But he never said  He was involved  Did you read  The 9-11 commission report  No nigga  Read the motherfucker  My Kyle Anthony did  Did you read it  Read that whole thing  It spells it out  In such simple terms  But that's like  Reading the other report  For Kennedy  What's the other  Motherfucker  The Warren  That's like  Read that  It's non-partisan  It's just  They took the facts  They took interviews  They took tape  They took tape 
[01:28:00]  Security fucking shit  Of the guys  The terrorists  Walking into the fucking planes  They have that shit  Why don't we plant the WMDs then  If he needed the support of the country  Wouldn't it have been a lot easier  Just plant weapons of mass destruction in Iraq  Why not  How much more easier is that  Than killing people  Why not enough  Why was Kuwait enough  Why was Kuwait enough  We were all  Rah rah rah  Fucking go in  For Kuwait  Who gave a shit  But American flags  Everywhere  To protect  It was a different 
[01:28:30]  We weren't going  We were going to protect  We weren't going  Offensively  You understand what I'm saying  We were going defensively  And we had to defend ourselves  That was the first fucking war  Right  And I'm not saying  That  But you  You need  We didn't just  Indiscriminately go into Iraq  For our own shit  Now I'm  I'm saying that  You need  A big reason  To do  Because right now  Even conservatives  Even motherfuckers  Who hate Bush  Or love Bush  Are like 
[01:29:00]  Oh man  This is some bullshit  Yeah the war is bullshit  It doesn't mean that  9-11 was a conspiracy  They're two different  Fucking things  You don't think  You honestly think  One thing that could be  Do you honestly think  The government  That fucked me up dude  No  That fucked you up  Because you were being misled  What  What's the problem  With the building  What's the problem  With the buildings  Coming down  The motherfuckers  And you  Because  Okay  First of all  Let me explain  Like  That you're right about  Being misled  Or being  Or you can be 
[01:29:30]  Swayed  Yes you can  During the emotion  Of 9-11  Yeah  I  It was like  You're not thinking  Hold  I'm not  I'm a rational motherfucker  But I'm not rational enough  To go  God damn  These buildings  Came down  Looked like  They was tearing down  Kaminsky Park  With the way that shit  Like the way it fell  Right  And then the thing  On this  This loose change thing  That you  No history  There is  Never in the history  Of all buildings  Right  Have two fucking 
[01:30:00]  Starscreams fell down  Hey Patrice  By the way  There's never been  The fucking Empire State Building  Yeah  No shit  A B-52  No  A B-29  It was B-52  It was not a B-52  Was that the numbers important  Yes it is  Very important  Very important  But they had bombs  On the motherfucker  Big motherfucking plane  It had bombs on it  It hit the Empire State Building  And the Empire State Building  Was built in 1920  Whatever  With the old school  King Kong  But it's brick  That's what 
[01:30:30]  Bricks a lot  The way the trade center  Brick is a lot  Yes  Then what  Steel  Steel  Right  Yes absolutely  Steel gets affected  By heat  And don't give me the  You need 3000 degrees  To melt the fucking beams  In the trade center  You need enough heat  To weaken the structure  That's what happened  To weaken  It was the top  Of the building  And it all comes  Clashing down  Like dominoes  The fucking buildings  And this proves it  The buildings came down  Started their descent  At the point 
[01:31:00]  The planes went in  That's why  The second building  That was hit  Fell first  Because it was hit  Lower in the building  More weight  Above the fracture  And that's what  Brought that one down  You think they  Planned that shit out  You think they  Went in and planted  Fucking explosives  While some guy  Is trying to  Sell stock  Bring bring  Hello  Yeah  Sell 23  Oh hold on a minute  Excuse me  What are you doing  In my office  Oh  There's a problem  With the air conditioner  And I have to plant 
[01:31:30]  Some C4  In the motherfucker  Okay  Yeah  So what I say  Is sell  Sell  Sell  I'm not  I'm not  I'm not that delusional  Metal buildings  Were not brought down  You're right  In the history  Because  Fucking jet planes  Have never flown into them  We don't have a litmus test  For what  What the fuck happened  But what's the  Oh  Alright  We'll continue tomorrow  In 10 minutes  Done  That's it  And I gotta tell you  I didn't get much time  That's right  We didn't even get into 
[01:32:00]  The blueprint studies  And everything  But that's what I'm saying  It's not as easy  As 10 minutes  You thought you would  Just discredit the whole thing  In 10 minutes  Alright final thought  My final thought  Go ahead  A lot of this propaganda shit  On these conspiracy things  Are wrapped up  In nice little  Web based  Fucking  Little flash things  That these  22 year old assholes  Put together  In order to find out  The truth  You need watch that  You need to go on  And do research  About airplanes  About the Pentagon  About the buildings  Watch Discovery 
[01:32:30]  The construction  Of the World Trade Center  Watch the takedown  Of the World Trade Center  Watch what happened  To the floors  How the place  Was constructed  The exoskeleton  Was the major  Supporting factor  Aside from the center  But it didn't  Elevated  It didn't fold  In on itself  It just  It just  Fucking  Fell  Those cement floors  Were suspended  By metal beams  Which spanned  The entire  Width  Of the building  The second  They got enough heat  To bend 
[01:33:00]  That fucking  Cement  Came down  Like pancakes  And physics  Yes  Where is it  Supposed to go  You get tons of shit  Hits another floor  And another  It did hit it  The fucking  Top of the World Trade Center  Hit the bottom  Of World Trade Center 7  It sat there  And burned for a few hours  And fell down  The what  The top  Of one of the  World Trade Center  Towers  Fell and hit the front  Of World Trade Center 7  And brought it down  Here's what I  The last thing  But why 
[01:33:30]  I believe in conspiracy  Is like a motherfucker  I believe  What  And don't believe  The puffs  Coming out the side  Of the building  That's amazing  That's amazing  You know what  You know what it is  Even a motherfucker  That doesn't believe  In that shit  Like you  You can't believe  That that could have been  But my thing is  The only thing  That I could say  Anthony  That bothers me  About any conspiracy theories  Is the amount of people  That would have to  Know about it  That's  That's the only thing  Keep me from going  Yep  Because a whole  Demolition  And where are the people  That were on the 
[01:34:00]  Pentagon plane  That never hit the building  Where are they  Where the fuck  Are the people  Flight 93  That crashed into  Fucking the field  But what  Where are they  What plane crashed  Into the Pentagon  Yeah where are they  Well what plane  We don't even know  What plane that is  What plane crashed into that  We know it took off  What's the number  11  I don't know  There was no plane crash  Into that fucking thing  Where are the people  And what about the  Fucking witnesses  Who were like  The 8th explosion  Let me tell you something  The explosion downstairs 
[01:34:30]  Explosion  A lot of that came  After the building collapsed  And people were in  Other locations  They heard an explosion  It was the tower falling  There were explosions  You know how many  Gas tanks were all around  The building  You know how much  Mechanical equipment  Did you see the loose change thing  Yeah  I watched the entire thing  There was a fucking reporter  When the building  Was still standing  Go boom  Brian Gumbel goes  There's another explosion  There's another  There were fucking  Do you don't think  If this building  Set on fire  There'd be explosions  No  Just fucking propane  They all had fucking propane 
[01:35:00]  Where the offices are  It's offices  I will show you  A compressor with Freon  In a refrigerator  That will fucking explode  Really  While you're standing  A mile away  The fucking refrigerator explodes  You don't think  And your reporter goes  Oh Jesus  That refrigerator  Man oh man  You don't think  There was anything  In the World Trade Center  That was explosive  Yes  In the basement  Generator fuel  How about generator fuel  Explosions  You know what kind  Of fucking  Explos  A generator  Doesn't just explode  Those things  Are made of gas  They made of fucking 
[01:35:30]  Wires  Well you know something  You show me the report  Of what happens  To a building  When a 757 hits it  And compare it  To what happened  Because you know something  I don't think we have  To withstand  A fucking  A tsunami  For a hundred years  A fucking  A hurricane  At  At  200 miles an hour winds  For a hundred years  Just continuously blowing  That it could have  Withstood that  The way those builders  Both came down 
[01:36:00]  The way they came down  That day  It's just  It never happened  Ever  Except for 9-11  You're insane  If you even think  The government  Was going to stop  Inspiring on this  It happened  You know why this happened  There are a group of people  That hate us  Hate our way of life  And actually planned this  Since 1996  And got us  They fucked us  In the ass  And we feel so badly  That we were gotten  That we're trying to figure out  Some other fucking way  That it happened  One more question  Oh yes sir 
[01:36:30]  Oh no  Yes sir  How come there's not  Been another  Here's another  And it could be  Uh huh  That  Maybe  Okay maybe  If we didn't have  Anything to do with it  Yeah  That we knew  That the plan  Was going down  And let the plan  Go down  No  Is that possible  I don't think that  Because all that chatter  That we hear now  We didn't hear then  I think they were  They were smart enough  And we were careless enough  We blew off a lot of shit  That we shouldn't have  You read that report 
[01:37:00]  Read the fucking  9-11 commission report  It goes into  Everything  The planning  Of  These guys in Germany  Flying in the terrorists  Where the money came from  There's a paper trail  That says  These motherfuckers  Did this  It's all there  I mean  Every bit of the story  Is there  It plays out like  A fucking movie  And we were careless  For not  And the fact that  All  That  Has  Every other day  They're like  We just 
[01:37:30]  Foiled another attempt  Mm-hmm  Well we stepped it up  Is there a possibility  Yeah  That they could have  Heard about it  Said look  We let this go  This will happen  If this happens  We can go to war  Okay  Alright  Let me ask you something  Who's we  Because we  Would then have to include  The fucking FAA  The security person  At the desk  That allowed  Mohammed Atta  To go through  When he showed up  On a computer  The other guy  That didn't get through  So  All these people  Were planted there  On these days  That let 
[01:38:00]  Where are they today  Who  How many fucking people  If you told  If you told Iraq  Hey man  Listen  If his job was security  Yeah  Then you go  Look man  Yeah but why aren't  Mohammed Atta  Is coming through today  Wait  Not one guy  Let the guy go through  But not one guy's talking  No one's talking  Not one guy  So where is the guy  Coming through gone  You would never  If you was doing  A conspiracy right  If it was a conspiracy  Here  The fact that  People are very apt  To just follow directions 
[01:38:30]  Come on let's be honest  No everybody  Are penguins man  They'll just follow  Your directions  If you told  If you and  You and Oak  Just decided  We're gonna do  Something fucked up  Uh huh  It would be so easy  For you to go  To Ben  Hey Ben do this  Than Ben to go do that  And just continue to  Like defer  But you don't think  When  And that no one  Would ever know  You don't think  When that fucked up  Thing happened  That we were planning  That all of them  Would kind of  Come together  And go  Dude that was  That was kind of 
[01:39:00]  A fucked up thing  They did  Why would they  Cause they don't  They're not  They don't know  Like  Like fucking  Ben wouldn't know  If he did something  Fucked up  For a  Logic conspiracy  All he did  Was go  Okay  Why was  Moussaoui  Arrested  Then  Why was  He fucking  Arrested  Why was  Fucking  He was arrested  In August  Before September 11th  Why not let him go  He was part of the plan  He was part of the  Fucking plan  Why not let him  Go through  I don't know  What happened to him  Yeah  Well they arrested him 
[01:39:30]  On immigration charges  Uh  Because he was  Trying to fly  A fucking simulator  And told the  The guy that was  Flying  I don't want to  Learn how to  You teach me this  And got so belligerent  That the guy  Called the fucking cops  The guy called the cops  And said  I got this  Motherfucking Arab  That's learning how to fly  He don't want to know shit  He's a horrible pilot  He just wants to know  How to fly shit  And I'm a little suspect  And I've done my own research  I've asked a few pilots  During comedy shows  Uh huh  Can you learn  Can you learn  Can you learn 
[01:40:00]  Can you learn  How to fly  A fucking plane  A 757 plane  Into a building  Without  Without  Like  Flying for years  He's like  No you cannot  As a pilot  As any fucking pilot  A simulator  Can't teach you  How to fucking fly  They had enough  Training  In small aircraft  And in simulators  The fucking  Plane  All you need to know  Is the autopilot  All you need to know  Once you're in the air  Is how to work  The fucking autopilot  And you  And you can fucking 
[01:40:30]  Fly the plane  They had GPS  They knew exactly  How to get there  It's a clear  Fucking day  You ever look out the window  From Boston to fucking New York  You know exactly  Where you are  At any given  Fucking moment  How to fucking  Precisely fly  A fucking  Jumbo jet  Into the building  This is  This is shit  My own rationale  I could direct  A fucking plane  With the autopilot  Autopilot  Is the easiest  Are there any pilots  Who fucking  Are there any  Are those  747 pilots  Clearest day  Ever 
[01:41:00]  September 11th  Who fucking know  How to  Son of a bitch  Then someone  Had to fly it  Into the  Into the building  I'm saying  That it wasn't  As easy  As these goofy  Motherfuckers  I don't give them  That much credit  Apparently it was  That's my problem  We got beat up  And we want to  Blame it on someone else  No the truth is  We got beat up  You were able to talk  A bunch of regular pilots  To do it on the same day  Yeah  Someone flew it  Into the freaking  Someone flew it  They weren't  These goofy  But who did it then  This goofy plan  You got two guys  You got  It was a goofy plan 
[01:41:30]  It was a great plan  Those motherfuckers  Plan that shit  Nothing happens in this fucking country  Without somebody knowing about it  I just think  I know a lot of people  We dropped the ball  We fucked up  Wait a minute  You think  Okay  Alright  This is it for me  Okay  You think  That  Dick Cheney  And Bush  And all this shit  Coming out  That they some  Fucked up motherfuckers  You think  They were fucked up  Motherfuckers  That  That 9-11  Kinda fell into  Some fucked up  Motherfuckers hands  Like  Oh goody  We can be as  Fucked up  As we really are  Like  Thank you 9-11 
[01:42:00]  Like  You don't think  They was gonna be fucked up  Without 9-11  But 9-11 happened  To fall right into their hands  So they could be  The fucked up motherfuckers  We know they are now  And you're telling me  They planned it  Started planning it  Before they even got into office  I'm not saying  Hoping  Hoping over hope  That they win the election  And everything  Because this shit  Was being planned  Before he even got into office  It's possible man  Because his daddy  Was dealing with that situation  I have no doubt  That they  You know  Would exploit something like that  Oh  After the fact 
[01:42:30]  The exploitation  That isn't even a conspiracy  I have no doubt about that  Yes  He's exploiting it  To this day  I have no doubt about that  But whether they were involved or not  And especially as directly  As that stupid  Loose change  Fucking documentary  Docu bullshit shows  Is so preposterous  I use the analogy already  If I roll up a little piece of paper  And you turn your head  And I say  I'm gonna shoot this into the cup  And I throw it  And I say  Look Patrice  It's in the cup  You'll go  You'll make the assumption 
[01:43:00]  I threw it in the cup  Or you can make the assumption  That I threw it off this wall  It bounced a thousand fucking times  And landed in the cup  Right  You're believing  The second of the two  That I fucking threw this thing  No  No  The easy answer is  I fucking threw it  And it hit the cup  That's it  You're going so off base  That's a good analogy  But say  You  Your whole plan  Yeah  You was a fucked up guy  And a fucked up plan  Was  Was  Unfold  You wanted to do something fucked up  And it's like 
[01:43:30]  It depended on  That thing going in the cup  Right  That thing went in the cup  And you're like  Holy shit  Now I can do  The fucked up shit  I wanted to do  They  They're fucked up guys  They exploited what's going on  Yeah I have no problem  But they didn't plan it  It's not American  They might have let it happen  I have no problem  Believing they may have  Known some things  But  Thank you very much  Known some things  I can't fucking  But  I'm just going with  What were those things  And could they have  Stopped them  We might have been  Right  We might have been 
[01:44:00]  Caught with our pants down  So bad  That they could have  Even known  This was going to happen  And go holy shit  How the fuck  Did we stop this  Here's what they knew  They knew something  Was going down  They knew around  What  They knew around  What time  They knew that  Aircraft might be involved  This is all shit  Yeah yeah  That different agencies  That never fucking  Talk to each other  And they couldn't stop that  And they couldn't stop it  Probably not  You believe they couldn't  Stop it if they knew about it  Hey Patrice  Let's say  Later this afternoon  Somewhere in this city 
[01:44:30]  A bomb will go off  Go find it  That's not  That's not right now  It is too  Somewhere in this city  Okay  Ten other people  No  I'm not going to tell you  Who they are  Somewhere in this city  There's a bomb  On a taxi  Okay  Ready  Hi  The head of taxi people  Can go  No taxis  Oh my god  Now you're delusional  You can't stop the fucking taxi  They don't know  They don't know the day  They don't know  You can't even if  Stop the taxi 
[01:45:00]  You know what that does  To our economy  Stopping flights  They would have  That does to my dead body  When you build me up  They would have had to  Ground the fleet  Twenty times since 9-11  If we played by those rules  Already  They would have had to  Ground the entire fleet  Of aircraft  Twenty times  So what are you saying  We've been on alert  I'm saying that we live  In a risky fucking world  Because there's animals  Out there that want to kill us  Fair enough  They definitely  They didn't hear about  Nothing like this  The insurance companies  Everybody weighs the risks  All the time  No I'm not arguing with that 
[01:45:30]  I'm saying  But you'd make it sound  Like it's easy  Like well obviously  Something might go down  With planes  So let's just ground  All flights  Until further notice  That ain't happening ever  They did after it happened  Well they had no choice  I mean you know  Why they ain't got no choice  Before it happens  Do you see what I'm saying  It can be done  It can be done  No cause afterwards  Everyone's like  Holy crap  Exactly  But before that  Fucking collateral damage  Alright dude 
[01:46:00]  You need something like that  To be fucked up  Patrice I'm not gonna  Allow you to win that point  So after the  After the towers went down  Right  And security got  Ridiculous right  Right  We all were like  Hey this is what  This is cool  We gotta do this now  We all understand that  A few months went by  People were like  Ah this is fucking bullshit  I'm gonna be fucking late  Blah blah blah  They forget really fast  Right  That's why you can't  Do it before  You can't just  Ground flights before  People would lose  Their fucking minds  You notice that  And they had nothing 
[01:46:30]  To base it on  Ain't any guys  At the airports anymore  With the machine guns  Right  And everything  Everything's all  We're all getting  Complacent together  We're all  Understanding right after  It happened  And then some time  Goes by  Like I gotta wait  In that fucking line  You know  Right  But October 1st  You were waiting  In that fucking line  And you were pretty  Happy to do it  So do you  Now the fact that  You know  We're just radio people  Right now  Having a discussion  We are experts  We got microphones  In front of us  And you have human  You just have human 
[01:47:00]  Instinct  And you understand  Human instinct  Right  You don't think  The government  Who pays a million dollars  To just study all type  Of goofy shit  Knows  That what you just said  Is an occurrence  And you need  And that's what  They wanna do  These things  Shut down airports  Control a little more  So you need an event  Like 9-11  To continue  Just like the Arabs  Will continue  To use 9-11  This is what  Makes me suspicious  They continue  If I punch you in the eye  10 years ago  Right  And you're scared of me  Like that 
[01:47:30]  And every year  I threaten to punch you  In your fucking eye  You're eventually  Gonna go  Nigga  You know what  Punch me in the eye again  Cause you starting to  I'm living with  That same bullshit  The Arabs continue  To use this  9-11 threat  But if I'm a bad  Motherfucker  I keep doing shit  And I keep saying  Oh  Everybody's using  9-11 fear  Which means that  They're impressed  With what went down  They're more impressed  With what went down  They blew up  The USS Cole  Before that  Yeah  That was Al-Qaeda 
[01:48:00]  They went from goofy  Regular shit  To super duper  Fucking  Disrupt shit  Yeah  Because they figured out  A little weakness  And said  Hey  Let's try this plan  And it fucking worked  Osama's like  Okay  If you got a  Okay  Like say  Take the radio  Right  You thinking of  Like one of your  When you was thinking  Of the turkey shit  Was any little  Was you thinking of  Hey let's have  Roach counting  During that shit  You motherfuckers 
[01:48:30]  Was planning  Turkey day  So  You think  While I'm playing  In 9-11  I go  Hey  Jim  Why we doing this  Go  Go drive that boat  Up into the cold  You think they doing that  Those motherfuckers  That's all they doing  Is thinking of 9-11  Osama bin Laden  Was thinking of  Blowing up  Doing whatever  Whatever happened  During this 9-11 shit  It surprised everybody  Like that  It went down like that  But it didn't surprise  Somebody  Somebody knew 
[01:49:00]  About this motherfucking shit  A few people  You're simplifying it  New pieces  Bits and pieces  And you gotta think  They were thinking about  All sorts of ways  To get us  They probably had  All their plans  That they never  Went with  Because it didn't  It didn't make sense  A plane had never  Been hijacked  By terrorists  I'm saying  If that is your thing  Okay  It turned out to be  Their thing  Remember the guy  The blind guy  They arrested  Who they was gonna  Blow up like 13 jets  In like  What was it 
[01:49:30]  Korea or something  They had  They were gonna  Blow 13 jets up  In Korea  And the guy  That blew up  That tried to blow up  The World Trade Center  The first time  Yeah with the truck  That's the type of shit  They do  That's the type of shit  I give them credit  For doing  I don't give them credit  For what happened  They got all pissed off  Once you have a plane  Now you got a weapon  That sounds like  Some shit will do  It don't sound like  Some shit they'll do  There really isn't  Enough motivation  Motherfuckers 
[01:50:00]  Session's over  How long was that  That was a lot longer  Than 10  Motherfuckers  It was  Yeah that turkey day  Got you though  Don't throw away  It was too crumbelievable  Because of that  Don't throw  No don't throw away  No  No no  Don't smell crumbelievable  We're coming back  With crumbelievable  I get it  Hey that loose change  Got me excited  I'm sorry  We had a guy in the air  Y'all told him  A new asshole  These guys did  I was  I was  I missed that

[01:56:30]  I love  I love that you can say  Used to be  Well I mean  You're a lot calmer  Than you used to be  There's a whole  Steve Kingston like section  On OA virus  I don't doubt it  There were plenty of hours  Dedicated to him  Well last night  I took the privilege  Of listening to the Eminem tape  Where Opie called him  The worst program director  In America  Like 25 times  That was where we  Broke the Eminem  CD  Before the release date  We made MTV  On that one  Yeah  Well K-Rock was gonna  Break the  They were gonna  Be the first one 
[01:57:00]  To debut it  And they had like  A time and everything  Like that  That the record company  Allows you to broadcast it  And you're not allowed  To before that  So we'd gotten  A bootleg copy  And threw it on the air  And go no  We're debuting it  Here it is  They were gonna do  An Eminem weekend  Yeah Eminem weekend  Where they play the CD  And we just boom  Throw it on  And blew up their spot  And Kingston was really pissed  And uh  And then you  You read the cease and desist  Yeah we got  Immediately we got  A cease and desist  Sent over  So I read the cease and desist  With I believe  A musical background  Of the CD

[01:58:30]  Stay at home Spalding  And we'll get Spalding  I get Spalding  We like Spalding  So we can ask him  The exact same questions  As last year  He's doing some sort of  Documentary  About himself  That he's going to film for  That's what he told me  Who cares  What Spalding's doing  He's nothing personal  I like the guy  And the character's hysterical  But you look on IMDB  And it says Spalding  That's it  That's it  John Barman  That's his name  No his name's Spalding  Spalding  You're playing golf today 
[01:59:00]  There's actually a couple  People that have done our show  They're kind of big stars  They're going to be in town  That weekend  We're just waiting for  Oh yeah  So I punched some guy  Mary Ann's  At Mary Ann's  During Marathon Monday  Sucker punched  It was great  Sucker punched him  In front of all our fans  And then the fans  Proceeded to grab him  Pummel him  And throw him out the door  He was being a wise ass  He was being a Weisenheimer  He was being a real dick  Yeah  And he fell right into your trap  He's yelling things  He's yelling things 
[01:59:30]  And I'm sizing him up  Because I just needed to hit him  So bad  And we're live on the air  And he's  He's saying these things  Across a table  Pretty  Pretty wide table  Yeah  And I'm sizing him up  Like man  I need him to lean in  I can't get him  Gotta get a little closer  I can't get him  So I just kept going  What?  He's like what?  And really seriously  Ops cupping his ear  And moving backward  A little bit  Like what?  He goes  Dude I can't hear you  So he would lean in  A little further  So the guy would lean in further  And say it again  And Ops just like  Dude  If you want to make your point 
[02:00:00]  Fine but I can't hear you  And Ops would lean back  A little more  So the guy would come in further  The second he got within range  Pow  Right in the face  Ops he punched him  Right in the face  The guy staggers back  The crowd grabs him  Punches him  Kicks him a few times  And out the door he went  Well the bounce  Grabbed him  And all the listeners  Got cheap shots in it  Cheap shots  They were pulling this guy  Out of the bar  It was one of the best  Lures into a sucker punch  I'd ever seen  What?  Dude if you want to  I can't hear you  I was the only time 
[02:00:30]  I got physical  So  Yeah Boston Marathon  It's a crazy day up there  There was a few others  But  Alright  American Idol  Bucky got booted last night  Idol talk  Patrice loves the Idol right?  Yeah I watch it  Bucky it was his time to go  I think  Indeservingly so  Out of the three that were up there  I think it was his time  As far as singing goes  The guy cannot hold a note  He's got a style  That's like old southern rock style  He's got that southern rock thing happen 
[02:01:00]  I bet you hear things from Bucky  He's awful  Dude you're not  The second he's got to stretch a note out  Any longer than just going  Doing his southern rock fucking thing  He goes off key  He cannot stay on key  Why is Ace still there?  Ace is an idol  That's my fucking sister  She's in love with the guy  Yeah man  The chicks love him  He's devoid of anything  You see his eyes when he makes that look?  He's fucking retarded  He looks off into space 
[02:01:30]  Anyone else notice  Because I noticed the really stupid things  Anyone else notice that he had to make sure  That his belt buckle was being seen?  No  Because he had like a long t-shirt on  I was going to say that  But he has this special  Hold on Patrice  A belt with a really nice belt buckle I guess  So he kept pushing the front of his shirt down  So the belt buckle was being seen  Like that guy cares so much about his appearance  It's not even funny  Yeah  Very narcissistic  That's why he's an idol  Yeah  And he's never had anything bad happen to him his entire life 
[02:02:00]  That's why every time he's in the bottom three  It's really shocking to him  Why am I here?  He really should not be here  He really believes that he can win this thing  He's next to go  And there's a lot of guys  Like Bucky you know is just like  Oh wow I got to hang out for another week  He knows  Yeah  It is so obvious it's going to be either Paris  Chris Daughtry  Is Chris Daughtry in that  I think Chris Daughtry runs  Chris is going to win  Chris Daughtry runs away with it 
[02:02:30]  But people that should believe that they could possibly win it  Are Paris  Chris Daughtry  And you know some people are saying Catherine McPhee  But  No  Not the countrywide girl  The girl with the black hair  You think she believes she could win though?  I just think that they're going to be in the finals  It's just  Like Taylor Hicks  She's good enough  Taylor Hicks is a great example  That guy knows he's not going to win the whole thing  He's just happy to be there  And every week he doesn't get voted off  He's like right on  I get another week to have some fun  He knows  And he also knows that the exposure is going to be great for his career 
[02:03:00]  When he goes back home  He'll probably be fourth out  He'll probably be like number four  When they have four left  He'll be gone  But there are guys like Ace Young  He believes he's the best up there  He's the loser  Elliot's taking a fucking hike  Elliot's got to go too  Yeah  He's got  He's very talented  He's got a good voice  But there's just something that just isn't  What about the Mendeza thing?  Yeah his creepy face  Yeah maybe that's the  What about Mendeza getting kicked off?  It was Kenny Rogers' fault  It was Kenny Rogers man 
[02:03:30]  Getting in their mind  This is the thing  Yeah that country shit  Being in the business  You've been in the business 20 years  10 years  10  15  12  12  I've been in the business for 14  One thing I know  What main thing that you  If you win one battle  Is with the mind  Insecurity  If you can keep people from fucking with your mind  Yeah  You have a chance  Like if people  If Mendeza could have just went  Listen Kenny baby  Shut the fuck up  Nigga  When do you have a good  At what time was you exacting my voice nigga 
[02:04:00]  When you were saying  You got to know when to hold  Really?  Was you telling a story?  Was you singing?  How about Islands in the stream?  You fucking faggot  I'm Mendeza nigga  And I'm gonna sing you a stupid song  The way I want to  Now you can hate me  That's the film clip I wanna see beforehand  But that's what I'm saying  Well you heard her  Now you're gonna hear her sing  He got in her mind  Yeah  And they're getting in Paris' mind  And they're getting in Elliot's  That's what this whole thing is about  Is who can take the pressure 
[02:04:30]  Of the situation  Yeah I guess that's part of it  That's why Ace is possibly  To think about that  Ace could  Ace is devoid  Of that thing  So much  That it's possible  He can win  Chris Daughtry is another one  Who's strictly an artist  See the ones that are artists  Like that thing last night  I saw about Paris  Where her mom  She was never gonna sing again  And she's mentally disturbed  The kid  And she cries at the drop of her head  She's not well  She cries every time  Someone gets kicked off  Every week she's crying her eyes out 
[02:05:00]  I saw  During the audition  Yeah  She just  She came out the room  After what she did  Right  It's like she's autistic  She came out the room  When they said  You made it to Hollywood  She's crying  Like if I go  Does this bitch even know  That she's the greatest singer  I've ever heard  She doesn't  And Chris Daughtry  If he knew he was talented  He wouldn't be married  To that awful  Situation  That  That is over Johnny  That  That piglet 
[02:05:30]  She's not a complete hog  She's a  She's ish  And there's nothing worse  Than going out with an ish  Fat ish  She's  You know  She's ish  Smart ish  Smart ish  Nothing worse than ish  And she's not good enough  To be you know  A little chubby  She's fucking a mess  And he took her kids  This bitch came in  With a  With  Complete  Her fur  She had a complete  Furniture set  Sometime I go  Look my bitch got a kid  It's like okay

[02:06:30]  From the ishes  Don't  No ishes  Don't go down the ish road  The relationship takes  That he comes up with  Are so perfect  What were you saying  About your lady  In the back room  Before the show  Yeah she's  Yeah  Yeah she's getting  A little fat  But she'll lose it  Cause she hates being fat  And I don't  I help the cause  By not enabling her  When she goes  Would you leave me  If I got fat  I would have to sweetie  Cause you're not  A fat bitch  If I was to go out  With Mandisa 
[02:07:00]  Different  She is a fat bitch  But she can't get  Fatter than she's fat  But my girl  Is a hot bitch  So fat is not  In her  That's not her use  To me  Are you saying  Fat bitches  Know how to handle  Their fat bitchness  They just  They are fat  They're a fat girl  If you get a hot chick  That becomes fat  She don't know  How to be a fat bitch  And that's why  Hold on  I'm good with  Some analogies here  It's kind of like  If you're a blind guy  Your hearing gets  Much better  Yes  So if you're a fat bitch  You already know  You're a fat bitch  So something else 
[02:07:30]  In your personality  Takes over  Exactly  That's good  Exactly  That's good  And I've had my share  Fat girls  I like fat girls  Actually  When they're fat  Like when  You know like  What's her name  From Top Model  Takara  Takara  Like I wouldn't want her  Any other way  Than just what she is  Big old soggy tis  Big mushy gut  Kind of thing  I think she's sexy  But if she came in  Not that  And became that  I'd be like  Ah bitch  Because the worst 
[02:08:00]  My girl could be  Is Takara  No  Alright we're gonna  Edit you a little bit  Today Patrice  Go ahead  So we got so many  Subjects still to do  Keith in New York  Keith  Hey guys  How's it going  Hey  I actually disagree  With Patrice  Because I think  Based upon  Chris Daughtry's character  You know he's not like us  I think he's gonna be  More of a stand up guy  And take the high road  And stick with this girl  I don't know  I'd make that  He's gonna do that  For the pressure  Of being a good guy  But I'm gonna tell you  That guy does not  Have the muscles  To deal with the pussy  That's gonna come his way 
[02:08:30]  He's gonna fly at him  He can't do that  He's gonna be  Swatting them  Like they're gonna be  All over him  Like gnats  Let me ask you a question  Because you've been married  I'm getting married  Next month  And I really need  I think I need to get out of it  And I'm just wondering  How should I do this  How should you  Look  I don't  I really don't have  An honest answer for that  Because I don't  I don't know  Wait a minute  I don't know you  Or the situation well enough  But I can tell you  Just get out of it somehow  Don't go through  A marriage  Just for the fuck  Of going through it  Thinking  Oh well 
[02:09:00]  Yeah but we got this  Really expensive place  Picked out  And it's gonna cost me  Like over 20 grand  To get out of it  You know something  20 grand to get out of it  Ha  Mere bag of shells  My friend  Mere bag of shells  Because it's gonna  You're gonna spend  The 20 grand  Regardless right  Whether you have them  At wedding or not  What's your life worth  We have to reimburse  Man would've taken that deal  Oh my god  What's your wife  What's your life worth  Is it 20 days  You're 20 days  Dude  Do you really not  Want to get married  Well I am so stressed out  Being in this relationship  I'm using an albuterol inhaler 
[02:09:30]  Because I got stress induced asthma  And you're not even married yet  I know  How did this happen  How long have you known her  Two years  Two years  Now when was the engagement  November of 04  Of 04  Now you're talking  Almost right after you met  Or what happened  Oh no we dated for a year  Dated for a year  Then we got engaged  A year later  I got engaged  A year later  And you figured  Wow it's like  You know  A couple years off  This is cool  Time goes slow  And then all of a sudden  Now it's here  And you've been together 
[02:10:00]  Now what are the major problems  That she's got  Or you have together  That you don't want  To get married  Well bottom line  And she just doesn't get me  Doesn't try to get me  And she's really super uptight  And she's one of those people  Who  Is she in the room  If she doesn't get  I'm in my office  I can't yell  If she doesn't get  What she wants  The way she wants  When she wants it  She emotes  Like a five year old  But you know  She's one of those people  That's so put together  On the outside  The casual person  Who meets her  So she's so polished  And put together  And that's what I sell for 
[02:10:30]  Where are you going to meet a bitch  Who's not like that  See this is your fault dude  You're just  You're not going to meet  A girl who's not like that  That's why you  You just have to train this bitch  Your happiness  It's easy  I don't think this guy  How old are you?  I'm 38  Oh shit  They can train this bitch man  You're lazy  No you reach  First marriage?  Yeah  Yeah he's waited so long  And you got brothers and sisters?  I got a 30 year old sister  Is she married?  No  No  Okay  But you're feeling  You're feeling  I think you're feeling pressure 
[02:11:00]  But dude  I've been feeling the pressure about this  I didn't know if I should  Propose to her  And somebody just said  Just do it  And then I went and did it  And then every time we'd have another fight  You know we got to the point where  Like next time we have a fight  I'm just going to break up with her  And you know  Actually what it was  Is I was the one  Who was begging her  Not to break up with me  Every time we had a fight  And then it got to the point  Where next time this happens  I'm not going to do it  And then like  I caught her off guard  And all of a sudden  She backpedaled  And decided she wants to be married to me  And now the one  She's freaking out  And I just 
[02:11:30]  Dude I just don't  I don't know what to do  Because A  I don't know where I'm going to go  Because we bought a house together  Oh no  Yeah we bought a house  Wait you bought a house together  So are both your names on it  No just hers  Just hers  Oh get out of there  But you put the money up  Yeah we both did  Wait wait wait  You're insane  Why is  Why is only her name  You're telling me something  I don't know now  I know I'm insane  So I'm trying to figure out  But I figured you've been down this road  But what  Bad credit  No credit  Bad credit  What happened  Bad credit  He's a real loser  I know why 
[02:12:00]  Because the house was  Crumbelievable  Crumbelievable  If you weren't planning to get married  That'd be fine and dandy  But wow  You're going to get married  Oh my god  You don't need our advice  The listeners are saying it for you  Every line is ringing  Saying get out now  Get out  Get out  Run  Get out  Get out now  Run  Run  You have to figure it out  You only have a sister  You don't have no brothers  Yeah no  Damn it  You got any close friends  I got a lot of them  They're all telling me the same thing  Guys  Yeah  Maybe you need 
[02:12:30]  To work something out  Where  Could she possibly be unfaithful  Oh no  Not at all  That's the further  Would one of your guys  Be able to like  Maybe get her to have sex with him  No  Because that would be a great out  And what's your name  And where you're from  Keith  Keith you might have to tell her  You're gay  That's  Last resort  But  You might have to just say  Look  I live an alternative lifestyle  I thought this would change me 
[02:13:00]  Right  She's not going to argue that point  Look  I can't believe it  What is wrong with you guys  Now Patrice doesn't say this  Patrice sees it as  He should train this one  But she's too far gone  She's not  No she's a dog  That shits on the rug  And not a puppy anymore  How old is she?  She's 30  But you know  She's just  She's so well  We're going to have to bring back  The relationship  She's not a puppy anymore  You can't smack her  And put a rubber nose  In the shit anymore  All right  Listen we got to go  Just because there's someone  Standing by here 
[02:13:30]  That guy's punching out  Yell at Patrice  Thanks Keith  Poor bastard  Someone that wants to yell at Patrice  It's Mark Vestibule  Mark  Vestibule  I'm calling about the  What Patrice was saying  About them wiring up the building  They're not 11 buildings  What voice is this?  What happened?  They say he's got a sore throat  Oh okay  He's really pissed off  Fair enough  I don't know  I don't have a big argument  He's right  They were arguing  They were wiring the buildings up  With the Duke lacrosse player girl's fingernails 
[02:14:00]  Idiot  And he really didn't get me  It's an awful  It's just an awful voice  It's like  9.30 in the morning  What do you want out of me?  Colin quit everyone  Colin  Did you hear?  Colin you believe  Colin's a conspiracy  Colin is a disguised nigger  So don't even get on here  And try to play me out  He knows a lot about black people  I don't know  Fucking you know  You fucking know what happened Carl  Crank his phone up  I know one thing  That when it comes to DNA evidence 
[02:14:30]  Suddenly all our science is bullshit  And then when it comes to you  Deciding oh yeah  Well they can wire a building  On the one hand  He despised the white man  For being weak  And letting this country fall apart  Which we have done  Yeah  You know  Visit  For example  By inviting millions of more  Why don't we just get  Three giant Dodge Durangos  And just drive all the Mexicans  Across the border  On the other hand  But who the fuck is gonna clean your house 
[02:15:00]  That I know you don't clean  Cause you're a fucking  Nigga rich Mick  Who fucking  You have a Mexican maid  No I don't  I have a lovely West Indian one  It's all the same  They work harder than us  And if you get rid of those fucking  And you get rid of the Mexicans  That's exactly what we said  Then the West Indians go  Then who works Colin  Who cleans your fucking house  It's not even about Mexicans  Here's what happened  About 40 years ago  Your people put the bull on the white man  We cowered  And that was fine  Cause you had a point  But suddenly 
[02:15:30]  Not only you  Every other group  That didn't even get treated badly  You know  Women turned on us  And we cowered  Even the gay guys turned on us  And we still dropped  White guys are useless  I don't know how you still run the country  Colin  Because you know why  Cause we have to go to work  We have to go to work  We don't have time to fight these people  So we cave in  We can't be out in the street  No we can't be protesting with signs  There's no grassroot white guy  Help the white guy  We gotta go to work  I gotta punch a clock  But the problem is 
[02:16:00]  We did let  You know  Cause I'll say one thing  If you  I've seen black dudes  With briefcases  In suits  If a guy  A homeless guy  Bothers them  They drop the briefcase  And they put up the mitts  And the white man  Did lose a little bit of that too  They'll stand right there  In the street  Colin it's true  You're useless  Okay  When I start  When I start  Barking about fucking bitches  It's because  White guys can't be  You can't be men  And you can't be white no more  Like you're fucking 
[02:16:30]  What good are you  What good are you  What do you mean  Meaning like that guy  That just called in  What good are you  Did you hear what Anthony just said  The good we are  Is when it comes down to it  If you go to an office  Right now  And you try to get  Some bureaucracy done  And it's a black office  You know damn well  It's only 9.30  There's nobody there  That's what good we are  You have to wait  One in the afternoon  And then you get in there  And it's like some girl  With giant fingernails  Eating  God knows what kind 
[02:17:00]  Of Chinese food  Only in black neighborhoods  The Chinese restaurants  Open at 10 in the morning  But Colin  Black people  Black people  The only  But no  Black people  The only people  That still  Have a humanity  To them  Where they can hook you up  White people  Are so bureaucratic  It's like  I'm  I'm a computer  No  Because it says no  Yes  Because it says yes  But at least  A black girl  Go  Alright baby  Here  Go talk to this one here 
[02:17:30]  Talk to this man  That part is true  But guess what  That part is true  But the other side of it is  Black people  Work with you  This is Bobway stupid  You know people can't  We invented buildings  You never even thought  A building  You could go straight up  Above one floor  Because we knew  There was a such thing  As height  And falling  Black people  Are very practical  Motherfucker  We don't like  Going too high  Ground floor  It's easy to get  Through the window  And take shit  No it's true 
[02:18:00]  Your people are not  You know  They're not good  They're not built  For this kind of thing  It's a white man thing  And a Chinese thing  What that work  No the whole  The whole yeah  The structural thinking  Like those you know  You're very structural  I will get white people  Very structured  We are very structured  Structured  But just to know humanity  Just know  Life  But it doesn't matter  Without us  There wouldn't even be  Any buildings  There'd be no planes  We look at the bigger picture  See we're not  As self-centered  We're looking to the future  Like alright  We'll invent the airplane  It's not much now 
[02:18:30]  But in the future  This is going to take  Other people to the  And black people want  Like I don't want  Working at McDonald's  I need president of IBM  Right now  Black people invent  Everything that causes  You not to be chaotic  We invent the stoplight  The stoplight  And that's exactly  And that's the funny thing  And penicillin  So you white people  Can just stay alive  And I've never seen them  They walk against the light  Every time  And I'm looking at the car  Staring the white man  To say anything  Because the white man's like  Oh  I was doing Patrice's invitation  It was actually original 
[02:19:00]  It's not the prior one  It was corny  What they do  Yeah we really are finished  But so are black people  And you know what  The old man's jokers  Patrice I believe  We've discussed this before  You're right  The white man is finished  And guess what  The world is yours now  And look at it  It's going to be gone  In three years  Alright Colin  Alright guys  Thank you Mark Vestibule  Mark Vestibule  Mark Vestibule  An awful name  An awful voice 
[02:19:30]  An awful voice  But Colin stinks  Hi  Alright so back to  American Idol  This is  Colin Martling  That sounded like  This is Bucky  Getting kicked off  Last night  Leaving us tonight  On American Idol  Is  Bucky  Ace  Elliot  You are safe  Bucky  He goes home  Aww  What a shame  He was like 
[02:20:00]  He was the pride  Of his hometown  The racetrack left  NASCAR left  Did you see that  Horrible shit  Alright you want us  To cry I guess  At home  Did you see that  You hear a little  Controversy in his life  No  A little run in  With the law  Oh yeah  He's got his twin brother  You've seen him  They show him on the show  They look exactly like  Same dopey haircut  And mustache  Or whatever the fuck  And apparently  His brother was driving  And got into  A little accident  And his license 
[02:20:30]  Was suspended  So they kind of  Switched places  And went to the guy  That they got in the  Accident with  And said  Hey go along  With this  You know  When the cops show up  To say that it was  Bucky was driving  And the guy said  Okay  So he went along  With it  They got away  The cops  You know  Went away  Just rode them  Like a ticket  Or something  And then the kid  That got into  The accident  With the Bucky family  Goes home  Tells his father  What happened  And his father  Goes well  Did they offer  To pay for the car  He goes no  He goes then 
[02:21:00]  Why are you  Helping him out  You know  You could get in trouble  So they go back  To the family  First to try to see  If they're going  To pay for the car  And Bucky's father  Goes no  Go fuck yourself  We ain't paying for shit  And we're going to  Sue you  For damaging our car  The guy turns around  Calls the cops  Hey guess what  They switched places  This guy did this  And they ended up  In court  And what they did  Was they stood  Side by side  And had the judge  Ask the guy  That was suing them  Which one was driving  And he couldn't 
[02:21:30]  Point him out  So the judge goes  Look I gotta let him go  Hey that's a great story  So they got him  Off the hook  On the twin angle  That you have to be able  To point out  The guy that you're accusing  And the guy couldn't do it  That's a great story  But there is a little  You know  White trash  Kind of crime  Going on  In that family  Every American Idol  Thing has some kind of  Bullshit going on  Where someone's in trouble  Yeah they dig up your shit  Get that many people  In a room  Someone fucked up  Well that's why  It's gonna be fun  When Norton hits  On HBO  With Lucky Louie  Oh you know  They're gonna dig up his shit  If he becomes a big star 
[02:22:00]  They're gonna dig up his stuff  Cause when Rich Vos was on  Last comic standing  They started digging up his shit  When he was a donkey  Yeah  It was in the Inquirer and stuff  How long ago was that already  20 years clean everybody  Can you guys count for more in life  How much  You figure you say it on national radio  It's already said  Yeah  That's the weird thing  But it's not in magazines  And if Norton hits on this HBO show  All the stories you've heard  On this program  Will be in some of these magazines  You watch 
[02:22:30]  Norton  Dick  Was a cutter  Years ago  He would cut himself  Jim Norton  Was an alcoholic  And drug addict  But those  Getting back to Idol  Those video clips  Before they  Did their thing last night  God damn man  They were  One  They were all so depressing  The NASCAR used to like race  In where is it  Rockingham or something like that  Rockingham  Yeah  They show the track  With the locks on the gates  And then weeds growing on the track  Really  And then they go to  Kelly Pickler's grandfather 
[02:23:00]  Who's crying again  Jesus  All he does is  All he does is cry  Somebody else's parents  Is so proud  The girl that lives up the street  From American Idol  Is like  He's watching  That's what I'm saying  This country's so pussified  What guy just sits there  And cries over his daughter  All the time  Nobody  Guy just goes  I wish I had a son  Johnny Sacks  Plus he's crying  In front of his daughter  Paris is not gonna make it either  Man  She's falling apart  As we speak  Yeah  She's falling  That Chris Darcher  If he doesn't win man  I'm gonna be 
[02:23:30]  I'm gonna be very disappointed  He's gonna win  He's gonna win  He's got it all sewn up  Since very early on  I'll bet anybody  You hear the song  They sang at the beginning  Yeah  They were singing like  Yeah a bunch of Queen songs  And what was he singing  He was fucking sounding  Amazing  He comes away from the pack  He like you know  I'm kinda getting sick of his style though  You know  Every week it's the same  But every week  Every motherfucker who sings  Has the same style  That's like saying  You're getting sick of the guy you like  You're right 
[02:24:00]  Like these motherfuckers  They're disturbed  He's the same guy  It might be an overexposure thing  At this point  I don't know  How many other artists do you know  Have gotten that much exposure  On national TV  Legit artists  These guys have now sung what  Chris Daugherty sang 10-12 times already  On national TV  Yeah  Once a week  You do a radio show every day  For four fucking hours  Yeah we do  He can't sing one song a week  This isn't in front of 40 million people  He's getting some crazy exposure now  I guess you gotta point us 
[02:24:30]  I'm just saying  House promos  House promos  Yes  We're gonna do a speed  We're gonna do a speed round here  Can we do Queen  Lord in the moon  Do you know any Queen songs  I know a great one called  I'm in love with my car  That's all  I heard that one  I fucking love that song  They've been playing that one  Yeah  Fucking great group man  Freddie Mercury's a motherfucker  You watch The House  The TV show House  House  I watched it after American Idol  For the first time 
[02:25:00]  It bugs me to know  I hate it  That guy's thing that he does  Makes me sick  What's his thing?  Literally sick  This fucking  This retarded genius doctor guy  Who cured  But he's ultra mean  But it's really  Because he's trying to save lives  It's a self hatred thing man  An hour long  It's like  I'd watch it for the first time  I'll never watch it again  I'll never  And his staff is horrified of him 
[02:25:30]  I was  I was too busy  Watching Unanimous last night  What a  What is this  Rock of shit  That reality show  Can you explain this show please?  They put a bunch of guys  In like a fucking bunker  It looks like  And they have to vote  Unanimously  Who receives  A sum of money  So you think  Everybody would just  Vote for themselves  But you can't vote for yourself  So you gotta vote  Everybody's gotta vote  For one guy  Now it sounds pretty simple  But  They're never gonna vote  For the same guy  Never gonna vote for the same guy 
[02:26:00]  And the money keeps dropping  If you leave  The money drops  And the money drops  As  You know  The longer you're in there  The money keeps dropping  Dropping  Like it started at a million and a half  And last night  It was down to  What were they  Like just under  700,000  I didn't watch it  Just under 700,000  Here's a problem  I have with the show  And this is why  It's not gonna work  Obviously it's a series  Right  How many weeks  10 weeks  Yeah  They gotta fill up  10 weeks of shows  Yeah  So you're watching the first show  It's a million and a half  You're like  Well obviously 
[02:26:30]  They're not gonna  Have the show end today  No  And it's not gonna be that thrilling  When there's like  8 bucks left  Well they gotta go all the way  To the end  8 to 10 weeks  They gotta get  It's a series  But what's the choice  I still don't get the show  Neither do I  It's kind of like  It's basically a jury  Deciding  And they all have to agree  On one thing  And what they have to agree on  Is which person in the room  Gets the money  Are people eliminated every week?  Yeah  They have all sorts of like  Yeah  Survivor type things  To make it a little interesting 
[02:27:00]  But in general  That's the game  So in this room  We all have to figure out  Right  Who  Other than me  Right  I go  You know I think  Anthony should get it  And then you go  But do I know  Do you know  That I think  Anthony should get it?  No  It's all secret  But do you understand  Like the show starts  It's a million and a half  They do a vote  And the guy missed  By one vote  Getting a million and a half  But obviously  He wasn't going to get the money  As I'm sitting there at home  Like how could he possibly  Get the money?  It would be the end of the show  The end of the series  How many  Yeah 
[02:27:30]  Unanimously  Everybody has to say  This guy has to get it  Evidently  Yeah  And it also has to be  An eight week run  So right now  They're at six hundred  And forty thousand  I'm hearing  So  And they got at least  Three or four more weeks left  So you know  It's going to be  Who cares money?  That's why the concept  Doesn't work  What's wrong, Ed?  Let's see  I'm being IM'd  By the way  Which you know I love  Okay  Hi dude  Excuse me  Sorry for disturbing you 
[02:28:00]  But I have something  To ask you about  Will you listen to me?  And I write  What?  With like  Eighteen exclamation points  Well  Have you checked  Happy Typing Girls  Webcam?

[02:37:30]  Hasn't slept for 10 days  A woman's mysterious illness  Is destroying her body  She needs a new liver  Now  In a few hours  She will lapse into a coma  And she won't wake up  To save her life  Couldn't I be the donor  House will keep a secret  We're withholding information  It's not medical information  This is immoral  You'd really tell  Yeah  And hide a shocking truth  If she knew  There's no way  She'd go through with this  Anyone says anything  They're fired  Ooh  Wow  He's bucking the system 
[02:38:00]  Again  With the liver  I don't follow the rules man  You're gonna go into a coma  And you're not gonna wake up  Hi  That is every  Breakfast  That's every show  That's every fucking show  But how can you give a fuck  About the situation  Knowing that he's gonna  Figure out  Fix it  Every week  Every other week  Somebody should die  Stop  House fucked up  And it's like  House  House spends an entire season  In court  On a malpractice suit  On house  That house  That house needs a fire 
[02:38:30]  That house needs some spring cleaning  A car wreck on house  That house needs a wrecking ball  They canceled the jury for this shit  Alright Jim  You love the show  It's alright  Yeah it's okay to like it  Idiot  We just think it's a little too dramatic for us  That's all  And I knew  Watching the trailers  I'm like you  I'm like  It's  It's the guy  Yeah  It's his  Character  That fuck  I can't  I can't stand  Self

[02:39:30]  He can't fix himself  But he can fix others  And eventually he'll be able to fix his own leg  It's gonna cost a woman her life  In exchange for House's leg  It's the fugitive all over again  They've replaced his leg  With a child's liver  That came out of his ass  If it wasn't for a pair of aces  He wouldn't know he could walk  What?  Replaced his leg  Watching this  With a child's liver  Well  A liver leg  Is that farfetched?  Is that farfetched?  Why not House?

[02:48:30]  Gets a little emotional  The crocodile hunter  Oh yeah  As a clip someone sent in last night  Steve Irwin apparently  On a recent episode  Was mourning the loss  Of one of his  Dead crocodiles  A dead croc  Got him?  Dead croc  I saw some special  Where his cameraman  Got bit in the head  Or something  I haven't seen that  And he didn't shed a tear  Over that guy  Oh this croc  Kicked the bucket  And I guess  I guess the croc died  Overnight in its sleep  And Irwin discovered it  In the morning  And was very upset  Wow he sounds it 
[02:49:00]  Yeah I know  Very somber  Let's try that again  Okay  Yeah  She's going to sleep  The best way  Anyone could ever go  This is a really  Special friend of mine  Her name's Mary  And of course  She was over  A hundred years of age  And she's one of 
[02:49:30]  The most beautiful animals  I've ever seen  In my time  And I love her  Like  I love my wife  I just love Mary  So much  Holy shit  Did he say  He loved her  As much as he loved  His wife  Yes he did  You can act like a man  What's wrong with you  Hey uh Steve 
[02:50:00]  You gonna be using that croc  For anything  My girl needs a purse  I need a shoe  Some boots  Can I have your beloved  Fucking family member  For some of my  Fucking belts  I have never heard  Someone that upset  Over  And the croc  And the croc  And the croc  Was a hundred years old  Yeah he said  The croc  Was a hundred years old  Good life  Yeah  And at any point  If he petted the crocodile  It would bite his face off  The crocodile had no love for him  Would have eaten him  There's that clip of him 
[02:50:30]  Feeding the crocs  He's got like chicken parts  And he's throwing them  In the croc's mouth  And then he's holding  His little baby  He caught a lot of shit  For this  Oh yeah  He's holding like  A newborn baby  Justifiably too  Over the  Over the  Well no  He's kind of holding him  Like you know  Lovingly  As he's feeding the croc  As he's feeding a crocodile  And kind of the croc  Is coming toward him  And lunging  And he's kind of  Jumping away  That baby was like  That croc must have been like  Oh you know how tender  That is  I bet that is the tenderest 
[02:51:00]  Juiciest little  Chicken turkey looking thing  Oh look at that  I used to do my bit  About the Michael Jackson  Holding his baby over the  That was about the same time  Yeah  I'm like  It was  The crocodile hunter  Is using his baby for chum  And Michael Jackson  Is worse  Than  At least  It's because Michael Jackson  Was black  That's why it was worse  Well it's not anymore  So it wasn't  Ain't the fact that  In a couple of years  Michael Jackson's gonna be  Fucking the kid  And Steve Irwin isn't  Steve Irwin's gonna be  Fucking a crocodile  And no one really cares about that 
[02:51:30]  At least Steve Irwin's kid  Gets some loving care  After the incident  You never see a date line  Trapping people  That came to have sex  With crocodiles  You know  Why did you come  To this crocodile pen  Hey hey  I just tried  I like crocodiles  Michael Jackson  Is going to be having  Sex with that kid  I only fuck meats  I don't like the whole  So he cries  When the crocs die  Oh that's sad  I don't know  The wife must feel good  Feels just as bad 
[02:52:00]  Oh yeah  If he lost his wife  It's just one of those animals  You can't  There's no love there  You can't give love to them  It's like giving love  To a snake  It's like  It's a possession  You can't die  But dang  You can't love something  That can't have an expression  On it's face  Right  Show me something  No eyebrows  No eyebrows  It's like fish  Nigga no eyebrows  You need to fall in love  With an expression  Or something  You have to look at a dog  And he like  Puts his head  On his little paws  On the rug  And then you go 
[02:52:30]  Hey boy  And he looks up at you  And his eyebrows  Make that sad  Look  Now how do you not  Go  Good boy  Exactly  A crocodile  Don't matter what the fuck  Mood that croc is in  That croc could be like  Look at you and go  There is no chance  I'm going to eat you  I actually appreciate you  As a human  And it's going to be  The same face as  I'm starving  I'm going to rip  Your fucking head off  Basically he looks like  A burn victim  All the time  Oh jeez  Little beady eyes  What  I thought we were all 
[02:53:00]  Just having fun here  What happened  We're an Asian  Fucking  Fucking  You can't love it  You just can't love it  I don't really  I'm trying to really  Love cats like that  Because they don't  Give what a dog  Nah cats  Nothing gives you  What a dog  Cats can be friendly  Nah cats purr  Cats can be friendly  Cats will give you  A little something something  But I'll tell you something  They got the  Motherfucker attitude  There is no indication  When you get a cat  Whether it's going to be  A good cat or a bad cat  And you can't train it  To love you  A dog  If you give a dog  A lot of love and affection  When it's a puppy 
[02:53:30]  It's probably going to be  Very loving and affectionate  When it grows up  Into a dog  A cat  You can be the nicest  To a cat  When it's a little kitten  The thing can grow up  And you go to pet it  And whoosh  You get the claws  You get that thing they do  Where they grab you  With the front legs  Roll over on their back  And hit you with the back legs  You know why  Always out of nowhere  You just want to punch a cat  In the face  When he does that  You know why  Because you allow the cat  To shit in your house  What  Think about it  If you allowed your dog  To shit in your house  Oh you think he has  The run of the house 
[02:54:00]  It would have an attitude too  You do let the cat  In the house  In the cat box  The dog needs you  They go in the cat box  Cat's like fuck you  I shit  And eat  So you think the dog  Is only  This is a backwards attempt  By the dog  Because he knows  He can't get out the house  To shit  So he has to treat you  And he knows if he does shit  In the house  He's gonna get beat up  You're the guy  That turns the knob  He doesn't have thumbs  That's the whole thing  Between those and cats  You gotta turn the knob  I just summed it up  He loves your opposable thumb  That's all  Cat doesn't need you  For shit 
[02:54:30]  You already told the cat  Look  You can shit in my house  Hey shit in my house  And if you don't see the thing  It's gonna find a mouse  Or something  It's gonna find  Very self-sufficient  Do you have a house  In your house  Oh I have a lot of mice  Well if you don't have mice  In your house  What's it gonna find  Probably find something  Like garbage  It takes the little paw  And opens up a cabinet  He'll get into something  Some of your crumbelievables  You dog lovers out there  You let your dog shit in your house  And you watch  Your attitude  And it'll tear  You watch the attitude change  It'll tear the fucking packet open 
[02:55:00]  Right where they start to tear for you  Right  And seal it back  Let's go to Bobby in Boston  Bobby  Boys what's happening  Hey Bobby  Hey Bobby  Oh I almost  The fucking road  A croc looks like a burn victim  Are you okay  I'm feeling pretty good  I was  That was  You were talking earlier  About Anthony being a cruel  Trying to figure out  What his cruelest  You say shit like that  Off the cuff  I was howling  Howling  How do you come up with that

[02:57:30]  Well that's true  Jimmy Norton  I gotta look at an Asian  Let's go to Scott in Texas  Hey man  Hello  How you doing Scott  The skin is too tight  Around their eyes  So they can't open  Close nothing  It's just there  Hey opi  Yeah  I agree with you man  I had a cat  That I had in Texas  I used to let him shit  In the house all the time  The meanest damn cat  You could ever see  Every time you touch him  He calls you  Then I  I send him to my mom's house  In Alabama  And she let him shit outside  The nicest cat you could ever see 
[02:58:00]  See  That's all  I'm telling you man  I gotta agree with you  I'm telling you  I had four  Fucking cats  In my house  Because  My wife was turning  Into crazy cat lady  And believe me  It was just because  I finally put my pussy foot down  That it stopped at four  It started with one  Which is fine  And then she decides  To get another one  And it's a female  And one's a male  And it's not fixed  Hello  There's kittens all over the place  We want to give the kittens away  So we start giving them away  And she wants to keep one  And I pussy out 
[02:58:30]  And then she decides  That she can't decide  Between two  So she keeps two  Then they grow up into cats  And before you know it  I have four cats  I sent away  For one of those  Cat boxes  With the motor  That like rakes the thing  Each time they come in  Not too annoying  The thing was running  Like a refinery  Constantly  All night long  All you'd hear  And it would put it in a bag  It's just mining poop shit  It's mining  I was mining cat shit 
[02:59:00]  Poop shit  That  Jesus  Just mining cat shit  24 hours a day  In the middle of the night  And I was the one  That had to  Attend to the cat box  It was my job  Fucking wife  Anthony had chores  I had chores  Anthony had chores  I had chores  Big radio star  A grown man  That was like  Setting the radio world  On fire  Had chores  With carpool  He dropped me off  At my house  I'd be like  Dude what a show today 
[02:59:30]  We got an interview  Coming up  We're doing this  We're doing that  Top of the world  Man  We're gonna  Fucking go places  He dropped me off  Well  I guess you forgot  Where the vacuum was  No  It's in the closet  Oh well  If you knew where it was  Why  Why isn't the floor vacuumed  Well perhaps  Because I'm trying to  Make a huge radio career  And vacuuming  Really didn't fit into that  Patrice  This is where Anthony  Blanks out for about  10 minutes  Oh boy  Just sit back and enjoy  Oh boy  Don't look at him 
[03:00:00]  In the eye  I never knew  What I was coming home to  This was it  I would come home  I would come home  And Opie would drop me off  And he's like  So what's going on  And I'd go to Opie  I'd go  Who knows  Mixed bag  Can I  Because we're allowed  To talk about this stuff now  Can I  I did remember another thing  That I used to do for you  Yeah  Do you remember the times  I would pull up to your house  And you'd go  No  And we would drive around  A little bit  Because you weren't ready  To go home  Yeah  We wouldn't go to a bar 
[03:00:30]  Or anything  He's like  No  No  Could you just drive around  Huntington  No  Just take the long way home  Take the long way  Because some days would be  Well you forgot where the  Forgot where the vacuum is  Huh  And I'd be like  No  And then other days  I'd drive up  And like I was really  Into playing Half-Life  This game Half-Life  During that time  And I was trying to beat the game  And I was just psyched to play it  And we'd pull up  And I didn't know  If it was going to be  Angry Wife or not  You know  The where's the vacuum  Why didn't you do this  Get cat box  And then I'd pull up one day 
[03:01:00]  And all of a sudden  I'd look in  And it would look like  It would look like  Carrie's house  After she walked home  From the prom  Just candles everywhere  Oh candle night  Was always a treat  Candle night  And I'd be like  Oh I guess she's feeling  Amorous  This is great  Because I'm feeling  Nothing for this woman  And I go in  And all I'm thinking is  I forgot about candle night  All I'm thinking is  But I have to turn off  The power generator  Downstairs  To get the mob 
[03:01:30]  That I got  There's going to be guys  Soldiers parachuting down  And I got to shoot them  So I can get through  And get the formula  To the professor  All I'm thinking is  Half-life games  Patrice  You know around Christmas time  You see like the  Hanukkah candles and stuff  In every window  Whatever  He would have candle  Candle night  It was like candles  Like oh boy  Okay  I guess she's feeling  Did she hit you?  What?  Dude  I don't even want to look  She might as well have  No she never did 
[03:02:00]  I'll be honest  Was you going to abuse  The husband?  I was mentally abused  I felt mentally abused  I'm not trying to  I'm just wanting to know  Like when you come home  From being a radio  Personality  Yeah  Personality  We were like  On top of the world  Fair enough  Like fucking radio gods  Or whatever you want to call it  Right?  Yeah  And she goes  Did you forget the vacuum?  The reason I asked  Did she hit you  Is goes  Uh yeah bitch  I did forget where the vacuum was  And where was like  What would happen  After you say  Go fuck yourself? 
[03:02:30]  Uh  There would be  Hours  Of misery  Arguing  And shit  Like I would have to  I would have to plan out  What time  It was  As to how much balls  I could have  To answer back  There was like  If it was  If it was coming up  Late  And I knew I had to go to sleep  She came up with some shit  I knew I couldn't answer back  Or else it would be  Three  Four in the morning  With her  Hovering over me  Yeah you try to 
[03:03:00]  Fucking sleep  You motherfucker  And this  And I couldn't do that  Because I had to go to sleep  So  How many years  Did you deal with that?  Nine  Years  How many years  During the radio  Did you deal with that?  Uh  Let's see  All  All of Boston  Um  And  I don't know  Maybe a year  A year and a half  In New York  Yeah  Probably a year  In New York  Uh huh  So about  Four of the nine  Or four to ten years 
[03:03:30]  Nah  Closer to six years man  Because then we had  The BAB time  Oh yeah  Well it was all  You know  We had the BAB time  From 1990  Then we had the three years  In Boston  Then another year or so  1990  See but I was  A pretty beaten guy  Like I was  When I got married to her  I wasn't a radio star  I was fucking  Tin knocker construction worker  Guy  It was Chris Valtry  Yeah  Yeah  And she was  Was it an American Idol  Was this like your American Idol  That kind of go  You go  Bitch I'm a winner  I'm done with you  The second I started

Partially  No I was  Not with the teen thing  No I'm serious about it  We all went there  But it's like  By the way  By the way  To answer the question  That you started the show with  This is where I do  Get uncomfortable  This is it right here  No joke 
[03:04:30]  He lived  He lived through this  Opie was like part of this  Did you ever help him  Through his relationship?  No  He went through it  Like it was like  Some kind of fucking  I don't know  Like it was some kind of thing  That like a bank transaction  I went through it  Like it was a soap opera  Fucking knockdown drag out  It was just like a book  It could have been a movie  And I you know  Like I said  I got married  I was in construction  So you know  She's tending bar  To make some money 
[03:05:00]  I'm working construction  I got like fucking  Credit card debt  Up the ass  And you know  It was that  That was the deal  It was a lot of drinking  Going on  You know  Bumble party  So when did you have  The epiphany  That you weren't a loser anymore  I guess after Boston  When I came to New York  I'm like  You know something  I really don't need  To take this shit anymore  Cause it was just  Taking shit  Dude  Taking shit  Now what was the  Can you give me  One day of like  The day that you found out 
[03:05:30]  That fuck this bitch  Right  Can you give me  What you said  The day you found  Like how'd you  Finally get rid of her  Oh oh  That was  Um  Yeah  I'm not getting rid  Of my girlfriend  Oh you had a bitch  On the side  Of course  And she knew about it though  Oh yeah  Of course she did  But she just wanted  To hang with you  And  You might want to  Google Anthony's name  For the full story  Google Anthony's name  Whatever  When you first met her 
[03:06:00]  To be  To get to that point  Of I love you  And marry you  There was a good person  There at some point  Nah  It wasn't really  I love you  I marry you thing  It was more of a  She told a story  It was more of a  She was never really  A person that she really loved  Like that  I would never have married  A girl like this  It's one of the saddest stories  I'm not even kidding  This is where I get uncomfortable  It was I'm creeping up  I'm 30 years old  I gotta become  Like  And everywhere I went  I still felt like  A kid  Like I'd go  To the bar  It was your way of being a man  To the bar my mother worked at 
[03:06:30]  And they're like  Hey you know  It's Rosie's kid  You know  Buy Rosie's kid a drink  You're 13  Yeah  I was just turning 30  And it was like  I'm still a fucking  Like a kid  At work  I had a shitty job  And it was  You know  I was the kid there  Never treated like an adult  Never knew how to be an adult  Or you know  Anything  So where'd you meet the bitch?  I thought  Let's see  She was like banging my brother  For a while  And then 
[03:07:00]  Just a bitch that was around?  Yeah  Around at the bars  And stuff  And then we hooked up  And I don't know  We kind of hit her off  And shit  And you said  Will you marry me?  And she goes  Yeah  Yeah  You wanna get fucking married?  It was like over a lot of  Jack Daniels and Captain Morgan  You know  Oh  It was just  You know  Always  I was always drinking  I was always drinking  Never good fucking  Never really great anything  And thought  You know  It was just all  It was just back then  What it was  My whole life back then 
[03:07:30]  It was just a clusterfuck  Of like  Being in a place  And wanting to be  Somewhere completely different  I was working construction  Knowing damn well  This wasn't what  I should be doing  I should  I knew then  Before I even met Opie  I was like  I wanna do radio  I wanna be on the radio  How does a construction worker  Get into fucking radio?  You saved this nigga's life  Oh  Yeah  He knows it  Right  This is  Really  This is the  You don't even deserve an and  Hey motherfucker 
[03:08:00]  You listen to some VAB tapes  This motherfucker could still be on Long Island  Spinning fucking Aerosmith records  I'm just saying  I'm just saying  Without the and  Wait a minute  You're grateful for the and  Up in this motherfucker  I'm just saying  I'll tell you the God's honest truth  When I brought Anthony aboard  I had a name for myself  Where I was at at the time  And a lot of people said  Why  Why  You know  Put his name in the show  And I'm like  I said  Trust me on this 
[03:08:30]  How long before the and  Right away  It was immediately  Immediately  Second we got a gig up in Boston  You guys were Opie in the race  Yeah  Cause I get  I get shit for having  You know  An out of control  Ego and all this bullshit  And that's why I get frustrated  I was Opie for 10 years by myself  Doing well  I was doing fine  I had a career  Was it as big as this  Absolutely not  Would it have been as big as this by myself  Absolutely not  But I was doing just fine  And I was going places on my own  Okay  Fair enough  When I fucking worked with this motherfucker for the first time 
[03:09:00]  And I saw the chemistry  I'm like  Opie and Anthony starting tomorrow  Nice  I didn't even have to think about it  And I was Opie for 10 plus years before that  If you count college radio even longer  That's why Howard is the biggest douche in this business  Wow  No well  I almost got hit by that probably  You know  Because you know  Robin really helped him  You know  Get places in his career  And this motherfucker still thinks  It's all about him  Never be Howard 
[03:09:30]  You gotta be able to step aside  And realize what you got  You know  And I said  Trust me on this  It's Opie and Anthony starting tomorrow  Starting  I started calling my show  That was still mine  Opie and Anthony  When he came in  Nice  No problem  And I knew it paid dividends  Like crazy  You're being very nice about this  But he saved you  From either imminent death  No, no, no  A murder charge  Who did I know  Or 75 kids  Patrice  It was annoying  Patrice  The funny thing about this 
[03:10:00]  It was such a no brainer  Because what people don't know  Is Anthony was doing radio  With other guys at the time  And all these fucking  Ridiculous egos  Couldn't see the big picture  Couldn't see the future  Oh, he was doing radio  Yeah  He was on Howard's show  I had done  He did some things on Howard's show  He did things  I mean, there's a bunch of other shows  Chazza Pilar  And all they had to do  Was offer this motherfucker a job  He was there the next day  Eager  Like a little beaver  Dude  I don't  You had been  Just tasting around in radio  Yeah, I wanted to do radio 
[03:10:30]  I knew I wanted to do radio  I thought you just fell out of a fucking  A turnip patch or something  But I didn't have a gig  You know  It wasn't  But you had been  You've been  You was refining yourself  I was trying  Personality  Any way to get my foot in the door  Yeah  Yeah  I saw it and I looked down  I'm like  You gotta be kidding me  No one else has grabbed you yet  And there was  And then it was  And  And there wasn't  And you had that fucking  And just sitting there waiting  No problem  That anything was gonna happen  And then  And then we got the offer  To go to Boston  I had said this before 
[03:11:00]  I was making like  20  I was making  $29,000 a year  Not content  And the offer  To go up to Boston  To do radio  Was $27,500  $27,500  A year  A year  Oh believe me  There's shit in radio  When you first get started  So it was less than  I was making  Knocking tin in construction  And  You call them up  And tell them  You wanna make  At least what you're making now  Or no  We can't do it  We got credit card bills  And we  We 
[03:11:30]  And I'm like  This is wifey  I'm like  You don't understand  This is  This is the chance  Of a lifetime  If I fall on my ass  Like if we do well  This $27,500  Ain't gonna  Don't worry about it  And if I fall on my ass  I'll go back to  You know  They'll hold my job there  In Apollo air conditioning  Let me explain this  You can find  A million $27,500 jobs  Yeah  Believe me  A million  I could get the one I had  They would invite me back  But you can't find  Opportunities like that  They say it all the time  Opportunities come once in a lifetime  Blah blah blah 
[03:12:00]  That was the opportunity  Did you pull his coat  To let him know  Look  This is bad money now  But here's the potential  I didn't care  Did you know  What the potential money was  Hold on  And Patrice  Here's the deal  And Ant and I joke about this  To this day  It's a known fact  Ant and I make  Exactly the same now  Okay  When we were going to Boston  That was my gig  I got that gig  For me  By myself  They were ready to pay me  It was close to  $20,000 more  Than I was making a BAB  That's a nice bump  Big time  For nights 
[03:12:30]  For nights  No I'm going to explain the story  For nights  Right  But I was like  Fuck that  I got this new guy  I'm hanging with him  We're doing radio  And I knew they had  Afternoon drive available  I didn't have enough on my own  To get afternoon drive  They were giving me nights  For a nice bump up though  Okay  Right  So I said no  You got to hear the tape  Of Ant and I  I know you've heard my solo stuff  Whatever  But trust me on this  You got to hear this tape  And they fucking heard this tape  And went holy crap  They hired us the next day  For afternoons  And I went up there 
[03:13:00]  For the exact same money  Yeah so he took  Out of the budget  That they had  He took exactly  What he was making  At BAB  To pay you  So I could get the rest  So they weren't paying you  He was paying you  No they weren't paying me  See  Basically  If I was  A stupid  And really had an ego  That was getting in the way  I would have said  Ant you know  This is fun  We've had a good time  But holy crap  I can make an extra  $20,000 right now  To me that was huge  Especially at the time  But I saw the bigger picture  I'm like look  I'll take the cut now 
[03:13:30]  No problem  As long as I go up there  For the same exact salary  I'm making now  Because I knew  What kind of life I had  Which wasn't nothing  Was this some like  Loving for a sight shit  Or was you looking for  An and before that  I was definitely looking  I think you're always looking  But it was then  You know  Yeah it was  It was so obvious  I mean you already said  Man I need  I need a fucking  Like a partner  Yeah because I was getting bored  Doing it by myself  To take that to the next level  And you just kind of  Fell into it  So I went up  For the exact same thing  He went up  For the exact same salary  And then boom  Yeah  Within six months 
[03:14:00]  I think  Like she was bitching  About the 27  Within six months  I think I was making 35  Which was you know  They had bumped you up already  Back then to me  Was like  Oof  Amazing  You know  I  Knock and tin  I never would have made that  Doing what I was doing  You know  So it worked out  So how did it bump up  To the millionaires  You are now  Is that the  That's the game  Just being at the top of your game  Is millions  We got the mayor killed  Up there in Boston  Once that happened  They threw boatloads of money  At us for some reason  Yep  That was the old days 
[03:14:30]  When you fucked up  You fucked up  You went up  Right right right  And who knew that  Opie  I turned around  When we got fired from Boston  And thought  Oh my god  Now you fucked down  Now you fucked down  Yeah  At the time  I knew  And idiots were like  Pull me aside  You need to  You need to talk to a  A psychologist  A psychiatrist  You have problems  I'm like  I have problems  Watch what happens next  I was like  Oh my god  He got us fired  Because I remember  Because

[03:20:00]  How could it be  And it's that same ride  Admission to Mars is it  Or Mission Space  What's it called  Space Mountain  Mission  Mission  Mission to die  Mission to kill the clientele  Yeah it was  It's one of these things that  In essence it's a centrifuge  You sit in this thing  And because your perspective  Doesn't change  You don't see the outside  You just see like you're inside  A rocket capsule  Yeah  And you're looking at a screen  In front of you  So when they take off 
[03:20:30]  You know  You see yourself launching  You feel yourself get pushed back  In the seat  Because this fucking thing  Is on a centrifuge  And you actually feel  The g-force is pushing back  And I've heard  It's very realistic  And there's also  A thing that makes you feel  Like you have no gravity  Do the same thing  By moving this little  Apparatus around  They could trick your senses  Apparently it kills people too  Because some kid  If you remember  About a year ago 
[03:21:00]  Was killed in this thing  Some six year old  That looked like he was about 15  What are they getting  Like heart attacks or something  Yeah like heart problems  This woman apparently  Had blood pressure issues  And it's  It's killing people  But it's Disney  What do they do Ope?
