<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, along with in-studio guest Bob Kelly, engaging in self-deprecating and highly offensive humor, insulting both themselves and their crew.  Initial discussion centered on negative feedback from a West Palm Beach radio station regarding the show's syndication, with the program director claiming listeners didn't understand the show's premise or the hosts' personalities.  The hosts expressed disbelief and frustration, citing successful (though initially unenthusiastic) launches in other markets, arguing audience familiarity would develop over time.  This led to a heated discussion about the West Palm Beach station's premature judgment, peppered with crude and offensive remarks. Anthony then detailed the stressful situation of having numerous houseguests, including children, creating chaos in his home, likening it to a home invasion and discussing his gun ownership and security measures, fueled by a recent local murder. The "Whip Him Out Wednesday" (WOW) promotion was explained, with attempts to clarify the concept for the West Palm Beach station, highlighting a lack of WOW stickers.  Sarcastic character creation, particularly "Frank the Frowning Guy," and listener feedback were used to further dispute the West Palm Beach station’s assessment. The segment ended with ongoing concerns about both the houseguests and the West Palm Beach station, again featuring highly offensive language.

The show continued with a discussion of a Long Island businessman shot in the face during a possible robbery, focusing on the lack of detail in news reports, particularly the omission of the assailant's race, and the hosts' frustration with perceived political correctness in media.  A caller used a homophobic slur toward one of the hosts, leading to further crude banter about the victim’s actions during the attack, the unreliability of dogs, and one host's "cowboy" upbringing. Another caller recounted accidentally discharging a firearm as a child.  Bob Kelly joined the show to promote the Opie and Anthony comedy tour, featuring Bob Saget and Tracy Morgan, and the planned "ONA Village" experience.  They discussed Kelly's appearance on HBO's *Torgasm*. Bob Saget then called in, promoting the tour and engaging in vulgar banter with the hosts, discussing his role in *The Aristocrats*, his experiences with the Olsen twins, and the contrast between his public image and his stand-up material.  The segment included further promotion of the tour and Kelly's performance at Caroline's, along with extended discussion of Kelly’s *Torgasm* experience and the incident involving Dr. Ian Smith and Michael Strahan. Multiple callers contributed comments and stories.

The next segment began with a humorous hypothetical about a friend dating his friend's ex-girlfriend, followed by another call from Bob Saget promoting shows in Newport and Hampton Beach. The hosts then recounted an unpleasant encounter with a building security guard, using highly insulting language to describe him and their interaction.  A caller shared a similar experience, prompting brainstorming for insulting names for such security guards.  Audio of Bob Kelly breaking his knee playing touch football was played, followed by disparaging remarks about Tyra Banks. A listener contest for an iMac was announced, and a brief discussion about flag burning occurred before a random call.  The hosts detailed a "walk" around the city, insulting various people they encountered, including a cougar, two women they found unattractive, and construction workers.  Frank the Frowner attempted, and failed, at street interviews. The segment concluded with a darkly humorous discussion of a news story detailing extensive abuse at a nursing home, featuring graphic descriptions and anecdotes about elderly care.

The show continued with a nonsensical game involving mispronouncing "philanthropist," followed by a discussion of Frank the Frowner. The main topic shifted to Stephen Reneau, an 18-year-old with perfect school attendance (1960 consecutive days), which the hosts and a caller found absurd, leading to anecdotes about skipping school, smoking pot, and avoiding teachers.  The discussion included improvised scenarios and occupations, a caller's question about Frank the Frowner's opinion on a KFC controversy, and dark humor about Reneau's potential future.  A large portion focused on Star Jones' departure from "The View," playing audio clips and expressing highly offensive opinions about Jones and Barbara Walters, speculating on the reasons for Jones' departure. Bob Kelly again promoted his stand-up appearances. A "Dump Report" segment highlighted censored material, along with anecdotes.  There was discussion of a homeless cable access host and the use of WOW stickers, and a call from a soldier in Iraq requesting the show's broadcast.  The segment concluded with continued discussion of Star Jones and further promotion of Bob Kelly.

The final segment detailed a chaotic, profanity-laden encounter with a large woman ("Tina") at a Long Island mall, recounted by a caller named Bob and corroborated by another caller, Rio, mentioning police involvement. The description was filled with extremely vulgar language and insults toward Tina. The segment's latter half featured a listener-submitted audio recording of a man's bowel movements and urination in a public restroom, accompanied by extensive commentary from the hosts and callers.  In-studio guest Jimmy provided the audio, eliciting disgust and laughter.  The recording dominated the remainder of the segment, with hosts and callers reacting and commenting.  The segment concluded with further comments about the bathroom audio and an advertisement for Bob Kelly's performance at Caroline's.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Ovi, Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow, we're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  Ovi.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  No, that is...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boob that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care! 
[00:01:00]  Shut up!  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's terrible. 
[00:01:30]  I'm sorry.  Who's that?  Hello, hello.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's one of our guys in his acting.  I can't believe that I did that.  I am such an idiot.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  And that's Bob Kelly, who's joining the program today. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  The fruitiest sound a man can make.  What does that sound like?  The biggest problem with those clips is that nobody knows who they are. 
[00:02:30]  Of course.  Thank God we didn't describe those clips.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The one virus spreading across America.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  Wow.  For short.  Well, for short.  And we'll explain Whip Him Out Wednesday in a little while.  We'll especially explain it to West Palm Beach.  West Palm Beach.  Apparently. 
[00:03:00]  30 people down there loving.  But apparently they're a little slow.  They're a little slow.  They're a little slow.  That's my new character.  I'm not going to.  Thank you.  I am not going to blame the West Palm Beach people.  No, I'm not blaming the audience at all.  No, because they're not a little slow.  Someone's jumping the gun.  We're on WPBZ.  103.  1 FM.  West Palm Beach.  Hello, West Palm.  Good morning.  Wake up.  Wake up with Opie and Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  Maybe that's the type of radio he wants us to do.  And some of the people that work for the station might be a little slow.  They might be a little slow.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  We might have to explain things.  Yeah.  We have to really explain things.  Because someone that works for the station is convinced that the listeners of West Palm  Beach don't know what Whip Him Out Wednesday is.  Or anything we do for that matter.  Because we talk like everyone knows who we are.  All right.  Now we have to. 
[00:04:00]  See, your boys, Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton, we bust our balls every day for this fine  syndicated radio program that's heard on XM and heard on about, what, 10 or 11 commercial  radio stations?  Right.  And we're kicking ass everywhere so far.  Yeah.  And we kind of get some research, some survey questions answered from all the markets.  And not the people, though.  Not the audience.  No.  Just from the people that are working at the stations. 
[00:04:30]  The people in charge.  The program directors.  And things as such.  You know.  Suits.  Suits.  Yeah.  Good old suits.  Suits.  Suits.  I'm trying to get an example.  Let's see.  All right.  Like, for example, Dallas.  They would like to have Opie or Jim Norton on with their midday show to promote the show.  That makes perfect sense.  You guys down there.  You know. 
[00:05:00]  Pugs and Kelly.  Pugs and Kelly.  Friends with them.  Be on the show.  That's a nice cross promotion.  They also want the comedy tour to go to Dallas.  All right.  So they give us these things that, you know.  Suggestions.  Suggestions and stuff that help the program, obviously.  BCN, forget about it.  I mean, it's amazing the stuff they're talking about and, you know, and the info they're giving us.  Okay.  I'm just going through this really fast.  Sorry.  And then Detroit, just completely motivated. 
[00:05:30]  And they want billboards in Detroit.  They believe in the Opie and Anthony show, but they feel like, you know, it's a new market for us.  So they would like a little help from the company.  Sure.  Some billboards, things like that.  Okay.  And that's a great way to look at it.  Hey, they're new to the market.  Let's get some advertising that lets people know what these guys are all about in a quick billboard or some kind of line on a bus poster or something like that.  Philly wants a live broadcast.  They want an appearance, a concert with the guys before the big September event. 
[00:06:00]  You know, before the big comedy event that we're going to do in the Philly area.  Right.  They also want us on Barsky's show or Kid Chris's show.  These are requests coming in from the markets.  Okay.  And it goes on and on.  Very, very positive in general.  Even in the cities we never broadcast it to.  Pittsburgh, nothing but positive feedback.  And I'm very excited to have us on WKRZ 93.7 or 93.7.  Excited to be there, Opie.  Very excited, okay.  And then Dallas, you know, sent in the bus boards, whatever they're called, the kiosks that are all over the Dallas area. 
[00:06:30]  So we get this packet.  It just begun.  But the first packet is in my hand.  Yeah.  And, man, very disturbing looking at the West Palm Beach page.  I got to tell you.  Oh, my God.  It's a lot different than all the other pages.  All the other pages were these nice, constructive, and just happy ways to make this show positive.  Not that we're looking, you know, and if you have a reason to be negative about the show or, you know, what you need, that's fine. 
[00:07:00]  But have there been any reasons yet?  I don't know.  We've been on a little around a month.  About a month, a little over a month.  And there's promos for the Opie and Anthony show that run after we get off the air, right?  Yeah.  And all the other cities, they are just pounding the Opie and Anthony promos like crazy.  So one of the bigwigs here in New York that oversees all of this in programming kind of looked a little deeper into the West Palm situation because they brought up some stuff. 
[00:07:30]  And noticed they're not running the Opie and Anthony promo as heavy as all the other stations.  Why?  Which completely goes against some of the stuff this guy is trying to tell us.  Your morning show is supposed to be your anchor.  So West Palm Beach under the – I'm not going to call the guy out.  That's fine.  Not yet.  Because we don't really know him.  Right.  Maybe he's – maybe he's – maybe he is passionate and into it. 
[00:08:00]  Maybe he isn't.  I don't know yet, to be honest with you.  Don't know.  We don't know.  So we'll just keep it at that.  But issues, questions you have of any programming or promotional concerns with the Opie and Anthony show.  So – and the answer here is biggest problem with the show is that they talk like everyone knows who they are.  Well, what – what are we supposed to do?  Every – just introduce ourselves every three minutes.  Every three minutes, right.  Or every time we get a new syndicated market, we start over. 
[00:08:30]  We review tapes at night of our first few shows and just do that again so everyone's in on the inside jokes and everything else.  Does this guy understand that any talk show in this genre is based on people catching on over time?  Something catches their interest enough to make them kind of listen to the show?  And eventually we do get to things and you kind of – it's like picking up a dopey – I'll use a woman's analogy for this guy. 
[00:09:00]  I'll use a woman's analogy like a soap opera.  What do you think?  People have to rewind to 1955 when some of these things started to get who the characters are?  You sit down for a few days and you know exactly who everyone is and what they're doing.  You got to invest in it.  Yeah, of course.  That's all we're talking.  You got to invest in it.  Shut up.  No, this is me over here.  Jimmy is narrating who is talking.  I'm a little bit sad.  I'm Frank. 
[00:09:30]  Oh.  Hey, Frank.  That's a character now, West Palm guy.  That's Frank the Frowning Guy.  Yeah, he makes an appearance on the show.  Well, he just started making an appearance on the show late yesterday.  Don't take that too seriously because that's a sarcastic thing because other stations, shows, come up with wacky characters.  Now, we wouldn't honestly do that because our show isn't really conducive to the stupid character thing.  But we goof on that character, and that's why Jimmy came up with that character.  Let me explain that. 
[00:10:00]  That was just Jim Morton pretending to be Frank the Frown.  Right, because the fear I have is that someone's going to hear that and not knowing the show because we haven't explained it actually think that we have a character as lame as the frowning guy.  You know, it takes more muscles to frown with the smile they tell me.  See, he's doing the frowning guy.  But please, please don't take that seriously.  It's very sarcastic.  I'm not really sad in real life.  No.  So the biggest problem with the show is that they talk like everyone knows who they are.  Ass.  Because any TV show or any talk show on the radio, you've got to invest some time in it. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  And a little more than a month, mind you.  Right.  And then it says, in this market, no one knows who they are, and response to the show has been less than enthusiastic.  Let me tell you about another city that didn't know who we were.  We worked at WNEW here in New York.  That's right.  We had started doing well in New York City, but outside of New York City, aside from Boston, but we weren't being broadcast there. 
[00:11:00]  No one knew who we were.  No one.  A little city you might have heard of called Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Philadelphia.  We syndicated into Philly.  And they didn't know who we were from a hole in the wall.  And in time, in very quick time, very short time, we were huge there.  And people loved the show.  Because they, people are smart.  This guy's got people, like, pegged as idiots. 
[00:11:30]  They figure it out.  We know radio, too.  We're, you know, we're not that stupid.  We know how to present things in a way where people will catch on.  But this guy's, like, petrified that no one knows who we are.  Yeah.  I'll tell you who they did know who it was.  Let me give you a little name of somebody that everyone in this country probably knew.  David Lee Roth.  David Lee Roth.  Pretty much a household name. 
[00:12:00]  You mentioned his name.  People knew who he was.  Would you like him back?  You want him back?  Name recognition.  No one was listening.  You jackass.  Oh, I can't take this guy.  I read that.  I was infuriated yesterday.  You're so right, Opie.  No, this is Anthony speaking now.  Just to let everybody know.  That's true, Finn.  Oh.  Look, don't confuse everybody.  Everyone knows you're Opie.  The people that have been listening to the show for many years know that you're Opie. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, it just annoyed me.  And what annoyed me most is because there has been no little litmus test as to how well we  are doing down there.  That's way too early.  It's too early.  I mean, the same thing happened in Cleveland.  Yeah.  Because then you could argue, well, New York and Philly, they're relatively close, so there  might be some kind of crossover audience that heard of us in New York and kind of live far 
[00:13:00]  enough to pick up WISP, the station we were on.  Yeah.  What about that?  But then you take the Cleveland situation.  And we never explained the show.  We just started being syndicated to Cleveland and completely mopped up within three to four  months.  We never had to sit and spend an entire show just explaining what we do, explaining the  characters, explaining myself, Anthony, and Jim to the listeners.  How about our good friends in Pittsburgh?  Brand new market for us.  They don't know us from a hole in the wall. 
[00:13:30]  And so far, so good.  Ratings came out.  Nice.  Nice start for the Opie and Anthony show.  Thrilled.  Because we peak in interest.  Yeah.  People are like, oh, this is kind of different.  This is interesting.  I'm going to invest in the show and learn about it a little bit.  I think it speaks volumes when you write, in this market, no one knows who they are in  response to the show has been less than enthusiastic.  Let me tell you what that means, too.  Let me tell you what less than enthusiastic means, because every market we've ever gone  into, the first month, two, sometimes three, is less than enthusiastic. 
[00:14:00]  We could play phone calls in some of our most successful markets from the first couple  of months, and it is nothing but negativity.  Because if this guy knows radio, which, again, I don't know this guy from a hole in the wall.  I don't know how long he's been in radio.  I don't know what he does.  I don't know this Merle.  That's from Godfather, too.  Yeah, right.  It's from Godfather.  Please.  You know, Godfather movies.  So please understand that. 
[00:14:30]  You want to pop it in and get to that part?  I'll wait.  We'll explain it.  We'll explain everything.  It's Italian Shire coming with Troy Donahue, and they're talking to Michael.  Right.  So we just kind of made a reference to that.  We really didn't do it.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  That's everything on my left.  Maybe we should have the listeners explain the show for West Palm Beach.  So he doesn't know us.  We don't know him.  What the?  I could profile.  What's his deal?  I could easily profile the guy.  Goddamn, I lost my train of thought.  I had something good.  No, you didn't.  On this guy. 
[00:15:00]  No, you didn't.  He certainly did.  No, you didn't.  You're saying that everywhere we go, we have negative phone calls?  Yes.  Negativity.  Right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Sure, Anthony.  We have negativity on the phones.  How many times have we gotten this?  Why didn't you let him wallow?  This is what I'm used to.  I don't like this.  Put back on whatever was on, because I don't like this, because it's different that's coming  out of my speakers.  So he must have gotten a few of those calls, and all of a sudden, the negativity is all  he's hearing.  We'll play your calls from N.E.W., one of our most successful markets. 
[00:15:30]  Philly, same thing.  At the beginning, you get that.  And if you knew anything about radio, especially talk radio, that's what you get at the beginning  a lot of times.  You get people that don't like change.  Then after a while, they start listening.  This is not what I'm used to.  This is different from what my normal daily experience is.  Be like everything else in my life. 
[00:16:00]  There you go.  Brian Regan.  Right?  When we first were at N.E.W.  That was the first time he was on our show.  And we were fielding calls, and it was nothing but complaint calls.  And Brian explained why people will complain.  This is not what I'm used to.  So moving on, there's a couple other things here.  To date, we have spent six hours in high-traffic areas handing out WOW stickers.  They have given out less than 30 in two weeks.  And then he writes very dramatically with an exclamation point. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, well, then Jimmy should read it.  And quotations.  Jimmy should read it if it has an exclamation point.  I try to read it as an exclamation point.  Yeah, we better explain it to West Palm Beach.  Explain that bit.  When we have to read stuff with exclamation points, Jimmy reads them.  An exclamation point.  It's under 4B.  Because you can't read things with exclamation points the same way you would read them if  it just had a period.  Read 4B.  So Jimmy does it perfectly.  An exclamation point is like a long line with a period under it. 
[00:17:00]  Yes, for the people down there.  Read that whole section again.  For B, to date, we have spent six hours in high-traffic areas handing out WOW stickers.  They have given out less than 30 in two weeks.  And then in quotes, very frightening.  See, hence the exclamation points.  He's exclaiming.  Very frightening.  Frightening.  Can we do some math, please?  Wait.  Six hours in two weeks.  Now let's go weekdays.  That's ten weekdays in two weeks. 
[00:17:30]  That's six hours in ten working days in high volume.  Now how many hours is that a day?  Is that per day?  No, they just did six hours in high-traffic areas.  Total for two weeks.  Total.  Yeah.  So that's less than an hour a day in high-traffic.  And they see they've given out 30 minutes.  Way less.  That's, what is it, five an hour they've given out?  That's one every 12 minutes.  Maybe they just got very shy street dealers.  Hi, would you like it?  No, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Oh my God, I'm sorry.  I don't even know who the show is or what they do.  Would you like to put this? 
[00:18:00]  No, I would.  Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Don't look at me, I'm sorry.  Because I was in that situation back in the day.  Of course.  And, you know, if you're not motivated enough, you know, you're going to hang out,  smoke a cigarette, and throw all the wow stickers in a garbage pail,  and then go back to the station and tell them, yeah, I gave them all out.  It was unbelievable out there.  Can someone do some math for me, please?  Ten days, six hours, how much time is that a day?  I just wanted, I'm just curious.  I can't do the math fast. 
[00:18:30]  It's got to be something like under, yeah, like 40 minutes, I would think, per day.  A day.  Something like that.  Something like that.  See, for the people in West Palm, we're not good at math.  I was going to say, 36, that's close to 40.  Okay, 36 minutes.  All right, Mr. Spock.  Jesus.  A little over a half hour.  He's a character on Star Trek.  A little over a half hour a day.  And it's not really him.  It's just somebody that resembles him, so you call him right.  But, you know, we really don't mean that.  It's not really Mr. Spock.  Right, absolutely not.  On the show.  Leonard Nimoy has never been on this show. 
[00:19:00]  Although, we'd love to have him.  And maybe you should, like, you know, be motivated enough to get your WOW sticker stops to the point where people want to show up.  For example, WYSP is doing a sticker stop today at Riske Video, starting at 8.30 this morning.  YSP, ready for this, will be giving away 100 pair of tickets for their Family Values Tour September 15th in Philadelphia.  I'm sure people are going to be grabbing up stickers then.  And 20 pair of OzFest tickets August 4th, both at the Tweeter Center. 
[00:19:30]  It's Riske Video, starting at 8.30 this morning.  There you go.  I think there's going to be a lot of people showing up there because they're—  Are those high traffic areas?  Because they're motivated and they understand how to get people out to pick up the WOW sticker.  You know what I want an explanation of?  Why can't we write out a little sheet and send it down to this guy, like he wrote a sheet for us and send it up here?  I want to write down a little sheet.  What is a high traffic area?  Where is it?  How were these stickers given out?  How were people approached? 
[00:20:00]  Was it something like a club?  Was it an event?  Was it promoted?  They had a guy dressed like Hitler, goose-stepping the stickers over.  And, yeah, purely Jewish neighborhoods.  Yeah, well, Florida.  Okay, a Jewish state.  My math was right, by the way.  30 stickers in 10 days.  36 minutes.  It's one every 12 minutes.  One every 12 minutes.  Wow, was that good.  That's three a day.  Wow.  I don't think that's a very good ratio.  That was Frank the Frowning.  That wasn't really me saying it.  What was it?  Frank the Frowning saying, three per day said, Frank the Frowning ratio. 
[00:20:30]  Takes more muscles to frown than to smile at home.  Tell me.  I love Frank the Frowning guy.  Even though it's not to be taken seriously.  Major request.  Here we go.  Marketing money.  If we do not market this show properly in West Palm Beach, you can forget it.  You can forget it?  You can forget it, buddy.  We are no better off today than we were a few months ago. 
[00:21:00]  David Leroth scared off a large portion of our audience and they have not returned.  We need to let these people know about O&A, ASAP.  And does he have an insight?  That's accurate.  Does he have an insight as to where is he getting his information that they haven't returned?  Maybe some call-out research.  Who knows?  Call-out research.  And then he ends it with, this is not an option.  It's mandatory.  Wow. 
[00:21:30]  I'm getting this on PalTalk.  Opie and Anthony aren't anywhere to be found on the West Palm Beach homepage.  Let's go check that out right away.  Please check that.  Well, it says...  Because I have this guy's name on PalTalk.  If you're wrong, if you're sending erroneous information to me, you will be not only bounced for the day,  I will completely ban you.  You will never be on our...  You know what?  We've got to keep this fair because under 3, detailed confirmation of updated content for website, 
[00:22:00]  the website address is www.buzz103.com where O&A are featured on the front page.  Okay, okay.  So we've got to keep it fair.  All right.  It's there.  Here's what I do when somebody does something bad.  We have PalTalk, which is a video feed into our studio.  By you.  If you have a camera, you can pop in.  We can watch what you're doing.  But better yet, we have cameras here in the studio.  So if you go to PalTalk, you can look at what we're doing here in the studio whenever we've got something going on 
[00:22:30]  or we're just hanging out.  We've got cameras.  They're all over the place.  For free, you can watch us.  For free, you just watch us.  And this guy on PalTalk, Nightstr75, gave poor information.  He lied.  So now I will click on his name, bounce.  He is gone.  And now he will go to the banning page.  I will do that.  I will ban him.  All right.  And finally, because we've got to take a break here. 
[00:23:00]  To let people know about WOW, we created a promo to explain it.  I need that promo.  Because I guess we didn't explain WOW Whip Him Out Wednesday good enough,  even though we explain it every Wednesday we have promos.  Basically, you get a WOW bumper sticker.  You throw it on your car.  And there are girls out there that will flash you if they see the WOW on your car.  WOW stands for Whip Him Out Wednesday.  You want a sticker?  No, no, no.  No, no.  Okay. 
[00:23:30]  Okay.  I'll go away now.  Do you want to put this on your...  I prefer not to...  Okay.  I'll go over here now.  Come on.  Come on.  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Would you like to stick this to your car?  Zell.  Maybe they got old timers with walkers and they just can't move around fast. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Give out the WOW stickers.  That's right.  Find an envelope and put a sticker on their mouth.  Have a laugh.  And here we go.  As I said, they do not explain things.  They simply assume that everyone knows them and the show.  I've attached it to this email so that you can see the approach we took to get the word out about WOW.  Please understand we are thrilled to have these guys on this radio stage.  Sounds it.  We should read ahead before we talk.  We just need to get everyone else to feel the same way. 
[00:24:30]  Why don't we read ahead?  What?  That little thing at the end was just a make nice.  Oh, maybe you're right.  Yeah.  That little thing at the end is, you know, he still wants to get a paycheck.  Yeah.  Exactly.  He has to make sure, hey, no, wait, I do like these guys.  Don't fire me.  Yeah.  Would you like that?  I'm a team.  That's an I'm still a team player thing.  Speaking of firing, Sam, if you don't bring me a spoon different than this one.  What is that childlike little blue spoon you've gotten? 
[00:25:00]  I don't know what this is.  That is a little child's spoon.  It's a big it's like a it looks like a like a tongue depressor, but it's shiny blue plastic with a little little a little.  What is it, Anthony?  You better describe anything.  A little spoon.  What do I have to describe?  It's an awful little blue spoon with a giant handle for big down syndrome hands.  Maybe you should use it.  Excuse me, guys.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Would you like a wow sticker? 
[00:25:30]  No, no, no, no.  OK, I'm sorry.  What's wow?  What are you trying to give me?  Well, it's it's I don't know.  They haven't explained it to me.  We can't make it more simple.  You throw a wow in your car.  Girls will flash you.  That's what happens every Wednesday.  It happens every day at this point.  See, it stands for whip them out Wednesday, but could be whip them out whenever.  Maybe that's confusing.  And it's also just pure support for the program. 
[00:26:00]  There you go.  A lot of people just slap it on their cars so they can show that they support the program.  They listen.  One of those things.  And then before you know it, you're just driving maybe a month, maybe six months, who knows,  maybe a year down the road you're driving and a girl pulls up next to you and flashes  and you go, what the who the how the and then you realize, oh, yeah, I had that wow sticker  on the back.  Right.  Let's let's say hi to Doug in Arkansas.  Doug, what's going on?  Yeah, I think what it is, is they're used to their morning zoo.  So you got to explain it like this. 
[00:26:30]  It's kind of like prize patrol with bosoms.  It's prize patrol with bosoms.  Oh, because they're used to like prize patrol type stuff.  Yeah, you know, prize patrol, you put your sticker on your car and they chase you down  and give you a stupid prize.  All right.  There you go.  Someone like.  Thank you, sir.  Someone like Tony Van Driver.  Hey, my name's Tony Van Driver and I'll be out on the streets today.  Is your name Van Driver?  Is it really?  Is it really?  Can I look at your driver's license?  Because I bet it's not Van Driver.  It's Pete Douche. 
[00:27:00]  See, that was more sarcasm.  West Palm.  Yeah, yeah.  It wouldn't really be Pete Douche.  Right.  You might want to look that up in the old radio dictionary.  I'm sure there's people named Pete Douche and they're probably fine folks.  Yep, sure they are.  All right.  So we say hi to West Palm Beach this morning.  Just relax and enjoy the show and get to know us.  Don't think so much.  Slowly but surely.  Don't think so much.  And we'll let the listeners explain the show to all those slow people at the West Palm Beach radio station, okay? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  All right.  It's the one virus spreading across America.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show on this fine Whip Him Out Wednesday.  That's why I love being heard all over America because somewhere it's really nice because it stinks in New York City today.  Global warming, man.  It is global warming.  Yeah, sure.  Scientists are backing Al Gore's movie.  Yeah, what scientists?  Like crazy, they're backing his movie. 
[00:28:00]  The ones that back his movie are backing his movie.  Go get that article.  I've seen it.  Go get that article.  I've seen it.  I read.  There are plenty of scientists that dispute the findings, too.  What about them?  It's a very dreary day in New York.  It's all agenda-driven, everything.  This is where I have to just shut my brain down.  Yeah.  It's one of those discussions.  No one wins in the end.  And I can't be bothered.  It takes up pages and pages on message boards.  It's like when a Republican talks to a Democrat. 
[00:28:30]  It's like, ah.  Well, that's exactly what it is.  Yeah, we sort of work together.  Doesn't that make sense?  Sort of.  Countries kind of split down party lines on every discussion ever, ever now.  You talk about something as inane as the American Idol thing, and it comes down to political lines, you know?  That's what it's gotten to.  So the global warming thing is people that believe in it and scientists that believe in it are predominantly Democrat.  If you don't believe in it, then you're a Republican, and, you know, you're with the oil companies, man.  And everything's split down party lines. 
[00:29:00]  You know what?  I'm going to save us a lot of time.  Here's the article.  Scientists okay Gore's movie for accuracy.  And you're saying there's scientists out there that don't support it anything?  What does that mean, though?  Scientists say.  All right.  How many?  Who?  Where'd they get them?  The nation's top climate scientists are giving an inconvenient truth.  Al Gore's documentary on global warming, five stars for accuracy.  All right.  The AP contacted more than 100 top climate researchers by email and phone for their opinion.  Among those contacted were vocal skeptics of climate change theory. 
[00:29:30]  Most scientists had not seen the movie, which is in limited release, or read the book.  But those who have seen it had the same general impression.  Gore conveyed the science correctly.  The world is getting hotter, and it is a man-made catastrophe in the making caused by the burning of fossil fuel.  This place is hot.  I like it.  So there you go.  Can we just do this?  Just rip it up.  Just rip it up.  I don't feel like arguing this today. 
[00:30:00]  Just rip it up.  There'll be no global warming argument.  You want that?  Go to NPR.  Thank you.  It's National Public Radio, by the way.  I hope that wasn't too outrageous for West Palm Beach.  West Palm.  Why didn't they discuss it?  I don't understand these guys.  Other talk shows would discuss that.  They're crazy.  I just don't get these guys.  Go to a message board.  Seems like they do nothing on their radio show.  Go to page 810 of the discussion and continue.  And that's when it gets really interesting. 
[00:30:30]  That's when it just gets...  And your mother.  Exactly.  Your mother's global warming.  What?  How about that?  Yeah.  How about that?  Your father.  What?  Listen, we got more important things to talk about.  Anthony is very scared this morning.  More important fish to fry.  Anthony's very scared this morning.  A couple things...  Won't be actually frying fish, people.  A couple things going on in Anthony's life.  He's got house guests.  Lots and lots of house guests.  I got lots of house guests.  I don't even know.  By the way, think more are showing up today. 
[00:31:00]  More?  Think another one might be showing up today.  Oh, please, God.  Could be another.  Yesterday...  By the way, to West Palm Beach, because someone at the station thinks that we don't explain  things, house guests.  You know, they're out-of-town people that come.  Yeah.  And they stay with you for a while, and they drive you absolutely nuts.  Drive you batty.  I don't know if you know what house guests are all about in West Palm Beach, so we better  explain that to everybody down there.  And Anthony likes his privacy, and he's kind of a germaphobe, and he's also a racist 
[00:31:30]  and a homosexual.  That's right.  Go ahead, Ant.  Not a racist?  Hey, I got house guests.  I'm starting to think that guy that works at the West Palm Beach rock station is a dope.  Starting?  He's full of bunk.  I'm starting to think.  Guff.  They don't explain anything.  All right, so we'll explain everything today.  How many times have we explained that?  So you got house guests that are driving you nuts, and now there's some kind of home 
[00:32:00]  invasion situation that happened relatively close to where you live.  Close enough, you know, I live in a nice...  Close enough to get you scared, which means it happened within a 100-mile radius of your  house.  Right, exactly.  I live in a nice community in the north shore of Long Island, New York, Nashville County.  West Palm, that means Anthony may be a little paranoid.  Right.  It's not paranoia if it's true, by the way.  I'm just very cautious.  I'm safe.  I'm trying to be very safe.  All right, go ahead.  That's what it is.  And, well, I have house guests, so they include children. 
[00:32:30]  There's three children, somewhere around five and four and two.  Those are humans that are not yet adults.  Right, they're not cooked yet.  And they just do...  Actually, they don't know about children in West Palm Beach, if you really think about it.  What are they?  They're the ones that point and laugh at me.  They wear the same diaperish undergarments that most of you do, but they're supposed to. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, but people don't laugh at theirs.  They're little children running around my house, and this to me is a nightmare.  I don't like children because they're always sticky, they're always messy, and now I'm  finding things on a daily basis, even though, I must say, the people are being, you know,  the parents are being as cautious as possible, but there's only so much you can do.  Sorry, Anthony.  Inbred.  Yes.  Check it in from the instant feedback.  Dear West Palm, a house is a form of shelter where people live.  A dwelling. 
[00:33:30]  Also known as a home.  Home.  We really have to explain this much to them.  Go ahead.  I have these guests, and they're little kids, and they're running around the house, and the  parents try their best, and this is nothing new to a lot of people, especially parents,  which I am not one of.  I don't aspire to be.  They are spontaneity wreckers.  They are house wreckers.  They are just personal property destroyers, children. 
[00:34:00]  You, as a parent, choose to devote your entire life to these things, these little organisms  that someday might grow up to be responsible, contributing adults, or sometimes they wind  up shooting you.  And it's a crapshoot.  You just never know.  Isn't that great?  You just don't know.  You can bring them up all nice and spoil them, or this, and you got them running around  in high school blowing people up.  You just don't know.  It's a crapshoot.  I don't want kids.  I don't like them.  I don't like them from the time they're little. 
[00:34:30]  I like them at a certain age if they're female.  But you got kids running around your house, and they're calling you Uncle Anthony.  Yeah.  That means you had some kind of relationship where they look up to you and think you're  a nice human being.  And I am, like, to their face.  You know, I'm nice.  I don't smack kids around.  One of them, for God's sake, is my godchild.  It's a very special and sacred relationship.  Sacred, right.  That's because it's sacred.  By the way, here's why they call him Uncle Anthony.  Anthony's house guest got a copy of Anthony's checkbook and showed the children and said, 
[00:35:00]  do you see all these zeros?  Be nice to them.  Uncle.  Uncle Anthony.  I am a godfather to one of these children.  But still, it doesn't make any difference.  They're always sticking.  Yesterday, I order out.  The girls are out.  They're doing their, like, shopping thing.  My girlfriend and her sister.  Buddy went out with a friend of ours, Vinny.  Went out to do a little drinking, I guess. 
[00:35:30]  So, I get home, and the kids are there with Buddy's parents.  Now, the kids are running around like animals.  They just run around.  Running, yelling, just, like, stomping.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yes, yes.  Bill from Waterford. 
[00:36:00]  West Palm Beach.  What Anthony is doing right now is having a mental breakdown while explaining his deepest,  darkest fears.  I sense I don't have to explain what a Nazi is to you.  Do I?  I don't think I'm a Nazi.  So, I'm looking.  These asses are just going through the dictionary like crazy.  Yeah.  Now, they're explaining running.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  I'm looking out the window, waiting for my food delivery to come.  And I look at the window, and it's been licked. 
[00:36:30]  They're licking the windows.  And there's, like, they were, like, drinking milk or something beforehand.  And there's, like, streaks of milk and, like, lip prints and cheek prints and, of course,  the ever-present little, little sticky hand prints everywhere.  So, I kind of, in disgust, kind of just walk away from the window. 
[00:37:00]  And I look by my door, and on one of the little columns next to the door, I see green that I believe is a crayon mark or something.  There's some type of green mark.  It could be poopies.  Stop it.  It could easily be poopies.  It is not.  It is not.  It could easily be.  It's a fine line that is squiggly and looks like a crayon mark or something.  Could be a scuff.  I'm not sure.  I just have a plan once this is all over that, like, a team has to come in. 
[00:37:30]  The Anthrax team?  Yeah.  Like, when Anthrax is found at the post office or something, and it closes down for months, and the team goes in with the biohazard suits, that's what I'm going to have to do.  For the house.  It will just never be the same.  It will be.  I will get it right back to where it was, and no one will ever know, children are even in there.  Don't you laugh at me.  That's horrific.  Don't you laugh.  That's horrific. 
[00:38:00]  So that's just the way they – the one Christopher, who's my godson, was eating yesterday.  I tried – I was in my office, and I'm on the computer, and I don't want to stay locked in my office.  So I come out for a couple of minutes.  Just let him talk, Jimmy.  I love it.  I come out for a couple of minutes because I'm just on my computer checking email and message board stuff.  And then I come out, and I go into the kitchen, and he's drinking milk and eating a slice of like Elio's pizza, but he's got his fist in the milk glass, and he's just kind of pulling it out and licking his hand. 
[00:38:30]  And milk is dripping everywhere in the kitchen, and I just look, and I swear I was pushed right back into my office.  I tried a little offensive.  I tried to make – to gain some ground, you know.  I tried to mount an offensive and retake part of the kitchen. 
[00:39:00]  I was pushed right back behind enemy lines.  I heard yelling.  I heard screaming.  My god.  My god.  Help me.  Fist with milk on it.  A bit.  His fist came out, and then he's drinking the milk, and he had like pizza hand, and that was in the milk, and it didn't bother him to then just start drinking the milk.  And it – I'm scheming you thinking of it.  I bet you there was pieces of like red pizza.  Oh, there was –  Swallowed it in the milk, and he's finally drinking them. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  Stop it, because there is –  Yeah.  There was, there is –  Doughy red pizza.  And you know what happens to milk?  It gets in all those nooks and crannies.  I know.  That's why everything's getting thrown out.  It's going to be a sour smell that you're just not going to be able to get.  I bet he washed his hands before he touched anything else in the house, though.  No, because the refrigerator, like I said, the handle on the fridge is caked, so I got to grab way up high where they can't reach to open my fridge.  You're a lunatic.  No, I'm not. 
[00:40:00]  You're a lunatic.  You'd be fine with that?  Yes.  No, you wouldn't.  And if there's anything that gets on my hands, then I just wash off?  No, no.  Like any other human being, and then I would take paper towels and quickly wash down the handle of the refrigerator.  Oh, now you're doing something called work.  Yeah, why not?  I don't like doing that.  So explain to Jimmy how you're text messaging your girlfriend, too, from your bunker.  That's what I was doing.  I was in my bunker.  I was in my bunker, my office, just texting my girlfriend who was out at the time going, oh, my God, this is a it's a nightmare. 
[00:40:30]  It's just a nightmare.  And she goes, don't worry.  Reinforcements will be there soon.  And I was I was I was trapped in my office because of screaming, running, yelling, sticky children start texting messages like do I hear yelling and screaming and crying and crying?  Yes, I do. And and and it's just a constant like yell.  It's constant from the time I get home till well after I'm asleep, because even even when I'm trying to go to sleep, there is constant screaming and yelling like it's an insane asylum. 
[00:41:00]  And it's not just the yelling I hear in my head every night.  It is real, authentic screaming and yelling.  I love the insight you're giving the people out there because they're all looking at the radio is like, yes, only the stupid parents are.  Yes, there are guys that aren't married and don't have kids that are going.  I understand your nightmare.  If you chose to have children, God bless you, because I don't know how the hell any of you do it. 
[00:41:30]  I don't know how you do it.  I would be in jail so quickly for either abuse, for duct taping the kid up and throwing him in a closet or I'd be like Joel Steinberg, just popping him in the face every so often with my fist.  It's good that I don't have children.  I can't take them.  At least you get to show him how to shower.  So that's been a plus.  I do.  What?  I don't like like daddy showed you how to shower. 
[00:42:00]  Well, that was many years ago.  You've got to keep the tradition alive and you don't have your own kids.  I was traumatized.  So I'm sure you're showing the little fellas how to shower properly.  And to explain Anthony's father, it's a true story.  Taught him and his brother to shower.  Like he brought them in the shower with him.  Just legitimately to show them how to shower when Anthony and his brother were respectively 16 and 18.  Much younger than that, I do believe.  Bunch of men learning.  But the nightmare of this whole thing with the kids being in the house is I can't have ready access to a loaded weapon. 
[00:42:30]  And with that, we're going to take a break and go to part two.  Part two.  Of Anthony's Nightmare.  Murder in my neighborhood.  Danny!  Neighborhood of murder.  A Quinn Martin production.  Quinn Martin production.  There are children in the house and Anthony can't have a loaded gun.  How funny is that?  What does this mean for him?  Could it mean murder? 
[00:43:00]  Dinner!  People are getting shot in the face.  I think that's hilarious.  No, it's not.  I think it's hilarious.  You know me.  I like a nice lead slinging device right next to my bed at all times.  I like weapons all over the place.  We'll get into that next, but first, Jeff in West Palm Beach.  Jeff.  Yes, Jeff?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, Jeff.  Hey, listen.  We love the show in West Palm Beach.  I've been listening to you guys on XM for years. 
[00:43:30]  Actually, since you've been back on the air on XM, it's the shooting radio station in West Palm Beach that does no publicity at all.  Thank you for another jump, another successful screwing up of our dump-free day that we had going.  We absolutely want to go to XM later on.  And get the news that, hey, guys, guess what?  No dump sheet today.  And what happened, West Palm? 
[00:44:00]  You potty-mouthed that call, and now we have a dump sheet.  But he's basically blaming the radio station, saying they're not promoting us enough.  But, Jeff, if you like the show, just spread the virus.  Tell others that we're broadcasting in West Palm Beach, okay?  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  Thanks, sweetie.  Good work.  All right.  Thank you.  And when we get back from a break, could it be murder?  Oh, there's me, too.  That's a hell of a radio tease.  Scared. 
[00:44:30]  That is a hell of a radio tease.  Hey, see, I get people that agree with me.  My newbie's coming, too.  Oh, what's that?  The Sudoku quiz.  Oh, that segment's stay tuned, West Palm.  Sudoku quiz.  I told you the Chinese are coming.  It's so obvious now.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Prepare to be wowed. 
[00:45:00]  What?  Knockers.  Whip them out.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow me.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Lots of instant feedback coming in today.  Jennifer in Kentucky.  Anthony is not insane.  My husband and I have been married for 13 years and can't stand kids.  As he was describing the pizza and milk, I was getting physically ill.  Go, Ant.  I feel your pain.  Thank you.  It does make you physically like, it gives me what they call the heebie-jeebies. 
[00:45:30]  You ever get the heebie-jeebies?  Or you get a little nauseous?  Or like you get that chill down your spine?  I get that when kids are like, yuckie.  We got one more.  Mike and Lodi.  Ant, you are correct about kids.  I have boys.  Three of them.  Nine, seven, and three.  The lack of sex between my wife and I as a result of the kids just torturing my wife each day all day is bad enough.  Not to mention everything is sticky from them.  And they break everything. 
[00:46:00]  And they just, you know, they're kids, so they don't know stuff.  They just don't know things.  Because they're kids.  I don't know, man.  There's a lot of kids out there that are well-behaved, too.  No, they're not.  Absolutely they are.  You know something?  Listen, these children that are at my house are absolutely well-behaved.  When they go out in public and stuff, very, very well-behaved.  But it's the home thing.  The people that other people don't see until, you know, they're at your house for a while. 
[00:46:30]  That's just their kids.  I'm not saying they're anything different from just normal kids.  But I don't like normal kids.  They run around.  They're blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, why the screaming all the time?  Is that necessary?  And you tell them to not.  But they might not do it for, like, two seconds.  Does this sound like a WAF break, by the way?  Talking over the music?  Yeah.  Oh, we talked for two minutes.  All right.  Well, here's Korn on the old station that really rocks. 
[00:47:00]  The music never stops here.  I will fade out the music to get to part two of Anthony's nightmare.  He's living a nightmare.  He's got guests.  He's got children running around.  They're wrecking his brand-new home.  And then in the paper today, murder.  Murder.  And how ironic, man.  Anthony is well-armed.  Well-armed.  He's got enough firepower to pretty much take out the whole neighborhood if you wanted to. 
[00:47:30]  Now, about a year ago, not even a year ago, there was this rash of home invasions going on in Nassau County, New York, Long Island, where I live.  And I decided, you know, got to get some firepower in the house.  So I go to the gun store, Coliseum Guns.  I'll give them a little plug down there in Uniondale. 
[00:48:00]  And what's great, too, you don't need a permit when you go there.  No, not for shotguns or rifles.  You don't need a permit.  You need a license.  You sign up for some stuff.  They do an FBI check on you real quick, and then you get your firearms.  They didn't let me finish.  The gag was they just give you the guns out the back door.  That was the bit I was going for.  They do not going to get anybody in trouble for something they absolutely don't do.  It was very law-abiding.  Yeah, real smart of me to blow up my gun store. 
[00:48:30]  And I picked up a shotgun.  You know, got a nice shotgun and a nice pump shotgun Remington.  And then I also, for fun, down at the range, picked up an AR-15, which is a lot of fun.  Blast off some rounds down at the range.  But, you know, I like having them around because there were these home invasions going on.  And I'm not going to be sitting there while somebody is tying me up with a phone cord and beating us, doing unspeakable things, and robbing us. 
[00:49:00]  That ain't going to happen to me.  Ain't going to happen.  You try to break into my house, you're getting shot.  It doesn't matter if I end up dead at the end of the whole thing.  You're going to get shot.  It's over, Johnny.  It's not going to be an easy time of it.  Because I'm sure the people that get these home invasions, when they're being tied up, are probably going, 
[00:49:30]  maybe I should have done something.  Maybe I shouldn't have left the door open downstairs.  Maybe I should have put the alarm on.  Maybe, maybe, maybe.  Maybe.  Now you're sitting there with your arms tied up and people ransacking your house and you've got to hope your wife doesn't get raped.  Which is an awful situation that you don't want happening to you.  You've got to be careful in this day and age.  This day and age.  Can I ask you a question?  You certainly can.  Do you have cyanide tablets?  If all else fails, me and my chick Ava, I've instructed us to bite down on the cyanide. 
[00:50:00]  No, I don't.  And I don't have a panic room in my house.  Although I've considered it.  Well, the whole house is a panic room.  The whole house is a panic room.  It's one big panic room.  I've considered it.  But because there's kids in the house now.  You've got to make certain concessions and sacrifices.  And one thing I will not do, and it's the reason I don't have kids, is have loaded guns accessible to children in my house. 
[00:50:30]  You give me the slow clap.  Oh, look at that.  Look at that.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you.  And the reason is, if they accidentally shot themselves, I couldn't live with myself because I would have wanted to shoot them.  You wanted the pleasure.  Yes.  No.  We had one in, where was the last one? 
[00:51:00]  Jersey?  It was just yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  Another kid playing with a gun in a hall.  Playing with a gun, and they shoot their friends.  And then you brought up an interesting point in the office.  How many near misses?  You never reported on TV like, oh, wow.  The kid just gets slapped silly by his father when he gets home for putting a slug through the wall or something.  You know?  I like how many, because you always hear about the ones that hit the kids, and you end up in the hospital.  And there's a lot of them.  So you've got to think there's a lot of near misses, too. 
[00:51:30]  Just taking out a lamp or something.  There's got to be.  Taking out a TV, like a nice plasma.  I had a flat screen.  I had a pistol when I was a kid.  On my 12th birthday, my father bought me this great Ruger single six.  This is a Western six shooter, because I grew up out West and rode horses and kind of grew up like a cowboy when I was in my early teens.  I used to go riding, rifle in the scabbard and gun and holster. 
[00:52:00]  And he had a bunch of lands, so I used to ride fence and make sure, you know, the motorcycle guys weren't riding through and cutting the barbed wire and stuff.  So for my 12th birthday, he got me this great six shooter tied down low on the leg, real nice.  And I used to practice quick-drawn with it, making sure to unload the gun completely.  Because as you pull it out of the holster, the whole thing to quick-draw shooting is to cock it as you're pulling it out.  So by the time it's leveled, it's ready to fire. 
[00:52:30]  You know, you pull the trigger.  You don't pull it out, cock it, and then shoot.  It's as you're pulling it up.  So I used to do that practice, got pretty good at it.  And then one day, I just, you know, strap it on after school in my room.  And then, boom, do the quick-draw.  And then I realized, holy jeez, I forgot to unload it.  I didn't pull the trigger.  But I'm thinking, you know, if the hammer would have slammed down, if I didn't get a good, you know, I hadn't cocked it well enough and the hammer came down, could have blown a hole through my leg. 
[00:53:00]  Things like that happen when you're a dopey kid, you know.  You've got to kind of learn these things are very dangerous.  So fast forward, you've got all these firearms and you can't have them laying around.  Can't have them laying around.  And then the near misses that we discussed that obviously are happening out there.  Somebody on Instant Feedback is saying, you need a dog.  No!  Worse than kids!  You need a guard dog.  Shut up.  Worse than kids.  Why? 
[00:53:30]  Dogs destroy houses.  I don't care who you are, how well you take care of your dog, especially a new house.  Like I said, when I bought my house, I love walking in the smell of the wood floor, fresh wood floor varnish, fresh paint.  Everything's brand new.  A dog does nothing but destroy your house.  Oops!  Oh, he had an accident.  That's not an accident.  That's not an accident.  That is pudding that is now all over my carpet. 
[00:54:00]  Look at the white shag rug.  That'll come out.  Oh, that'll come right out.  It's Scotchgard-ed, is it?  It ain't coming out.  By the way, way to relate to the audience.  Why?  Hate kids, hate pets.  Dogs screw your house up.  I don't care who you are.  You walk into somebody's house that owns a dog on a nice day like today in New York.  It's soaking wet out.  You still got to let him out.  What is he going to use the toilet?  Excuse me, Anthony.  It's kind of brainy out.  I'll just use the bathroom today.  You can continue walking me tomorrow just for the exercise. 
[00:54:30]  I could use the toilet, but no, you're a stupid dog.  You need to go out.  And I'm going to be out there in the rain, like walking this dog.  And then they come in, and what's the first thing they do?  Shake that wet, smelly dog water all over the place.  And then crawl up on a piece of furniture, which now stinks like wet dog.  I won't have any of it.  You don't want an Irish setter?  You know what the only smell, you know what's safe in your house and gives a nice smell? 
[00:55:00]  The smell of fresh cordite that has just been fired out of the barrel of your gun.  That's a good smell.  That's it.  And a crispy roll of hundreds still wrapped up from the bank.  Exactly.  That wasn't taken by some thief.  Anthony, I need to know.  How many more years do we have together before you're completely insane?  What time is it?  I'm thinking about maybe buying something soon, and I need to know that we're going to be doing this a little longer. 
[00:55:30]  I am the one that's safe.  Two or three years, tops.  I'm safe.  Two or three years at this point.  You're the lunatic.  No, no, no.  It's me.  No, you're the lunatic.  It's me that has to worry.  No.  You walk in these streets of New York City at night, unarmed.  You're a lunatic.  You're going to be committed.  Let's be honest.  Waiting for somebody for no reason at all to come behind you with a cobblestone over the head.  Well, just look around your neighborhood, and I'm sure you'll be able to spot the guy who's guilty.  Well, let's see.  All right.  Yeah, let's get back into this.  Sorry.  So I've had to take my guns, unload them, put them in high places, take the ammo, stick them somewhere further away from the gun. 
[00:56:00]  I'd have to sit there and go, pardon me, could you wait while I find my equipment and ammo before you do anything, sir?  Before you tie up everybody?  Because I'd really like to shoot you.  Craig in Pennsylvania.  I don't think they would, Jim.  Craig in Pennsylvania.  Anthony, you are a faggot.  Live a little, my friend.  Your guns don't love your back, dude.  I do live a little.  Well, guns don't love your back. 
[00:56:30]  That's true.  Your dog doesn't love you.  You feed it.  That's why it loves you.  A lot of people want to know how old you are by using the term quick draw.  And your gun would lick peanut butter off you.  They're calling you Wyatt, Kumia.  I was raised as a little cowboy.  They think you're Imus' son and not me.  Yeah.  I was raised like a little cowboy.  I had guns.  I had horses.  It was fun.  Well, you got to be careful in your neighborhood.  Keep your eyes out for this assailant, who's still on the loose, by the way. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, on the loose.  Here's what happened.  Nassau County, a very affluent neighborhood.  And, you know, this guy's still at large.  Long Island businessman was fighting for his life last night after a gunman shot him in the face.  Shoot him in the face.  Outside his Roslyn Heights home in what may have been a bungled robbery, police said.  Doctors at North Shore Hospital said Jack Singh, 52, is in critical condition.  Single bullet fired by his attacker hit him near the nose, passed through his head and lodged in the back of his neck. 
[00:57:30]  Police say Singh, his wife, and daughters, 10 and 10 months, were at their home right on the south service road of the expressway.  And the older daughter, the 10-year-old, said, I think I hear something in the garage.  Singh went out with a cup of tea in his hand.  Here's the mistake number one.  Who are you?  What the hell are you going to do with a cup of tea? 
[00:58:00]  What do you think you are, Hamilton at the convenience store?  All right, Hamilton.  You're going to throw it in his face?  Open the safe.  Open the safe!  Dude, a teabag in your face will stop you from committing a crime.  A teabag in the face?  A hot teabag in the face?  Yeah.  So you're saying if the guy would have laid a hot teabag, like just maybe thrown it on this guy's face.  Absolutely would have stopped the crime.  It would have stopped the crime.  Sure.  His eyes all over his nose.  Wow.  You can't commit a crime like that. 
[00:58:30]  Heck, that would probably hurt.  Hot cup of tea walks in the face.  What a dope.  Walks with a hot cup of tea in his hand and ran into a man with a gun standing between two cars outside the garage adjoining the house.  Okay, now it's starting to make sense to me.  I was wondering because the story I heard was the daughter heard the electric garage door start to open up.  Now, apparently, the cars were outside.  Perhaps this gentleman left his car door unlocked.  So these guys go around checking car doors outside the garage. 
[00:59:00]  See if the garage door open is in your car.  Now you hit the button and your garage door is opening up.  Put the car in the garage or keep the door open is outside of your car.  Oh, people are unsafe.  So this guy goes out with his cup of tea.  The assailant described in his mid-20s to 30s and in dark clothing dropped Singh with a single shot, then pointed the gun at Singh's wife, who was close behind him, but fled without shooting again when the wife began screaming for help. 
[00:59:30]  So here's the description we have to go with as given out by the New York Daily News or any other goddamned newspaper in this city.  Here's reporters Lisa Munoz and Leo Stendoro.  Yeah, here's the description.  A guy, 20 or 30.  In dark clothing.  In dark clothing.  You can't change your clothes.  Right.  Can we have a little better description, if you know what I mean? 
[01:00:00]  Why are we so afraid in this country?  We can cut down the number of people you then have to be suspicious of in a neighborhood or maybe keep an extra eye out for.  Or if you see a guy that fits the description, you then maybe call somebody who can then look into it a little further.  Digger Dog from Akron, Ohio for West Palm Beach.  Home Invaders, C, Negro. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, is that what it is?  Well, that's what this guy is saying on Instagram.  Well, I did a little investigating of my own.  I have police friends, and I said, I dropped one line and asked, what's the story with this shooting?  I go, I want a little more information on the suspect.  And I got the information.  And it was a little more detailed.  Well, now I know who to look for in the neighborhood.  Black guy?  White guy?  It was a black male.  So now I know. 
[01:01:00]  Black male.  Mid-20s.  Dark clothing.  You know what tipped me off?  Heading eastbound down the service road.  South service road or the expressway.  You know what tipped me off that he was black?  The fact that race wasn't mentioned by the paper.  That's what tips you off.  Yeah, because usually it'll say, described as a white male from, you know, 20, 25, even Hispanic male.  The guilt of all the people in this country.  Guilt as to not victimize the perpetrator, to victimize the whole race based on the perpetrator. 
[01:01:30]  I'm not going to sit here and think, oh my God, every black person's evil and a criminal.  But I want to know, when there's a crime committed, what the perp looks like.  When he's still active and at large.  And at large, somewhere around my neighborhood.  And he shot a man in the face.  In the face, unprovoked.  The guy had a cup of tea.  My goodness.  That little cup hitting the driveway.  Do you realize they described the beverage in this guy's hand more accurately than the perpetrator? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  Why couldn't they say he walked outside, but they had to say, with a cup of tea?  Don't you think it's good for the neighborhood to know if you can eliminate 90% of the population in a description?  Well, I asked Dan to get one of them on the phone.  I don't even want to confront the reporters.  Maybe the editor took it out.  I want to know why you print an article.  When there's a guy on the loose and you don't give a description of the perpetrator. 
[01:02:30]  It's the news.  Of course.  I saw news broadcasts all yesterday on this story.  And not one mentioned what race this guy was.  Race plays – I'm sorry, people that are offended by this.  Race plays a very important part in identifying criminals, whatever the color they are.  If they're white, then you know, don't look for a black guy.  If they're black, then you know, don't look for a white guy.  If they're Hispanic, you know, don't look for a white or a black guy. 
[01:03:00]  It makes it easier to narrow down who you should be looking for.  That's all.  Well, you know, I mean, the only time I think you should mention race is when there's a fat Italian guy with a bat.  Then you can harp on the white fact that he's white and the fact that he hit a black guy.  He's white with a bat.  He's white and he's black.  We get it.  Right.  Then it's a race, hate crime thing like that.  That kind of either alleviates your guilt as a white person or it kind of, like, takes away your resentment as a minority.  Absolutely.  So now I'm on the lookout.  Be on the lookout. 
[01:03:30]  Calling all cars.  Calling all cars.  Be on the lookout for a Negro.  20 to 30 years old.  Smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes as you're patrolling your neighborhood.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, Ope.  Anthony.  The wonderful 40s.  Let me get this out.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, Ope.  Anthony is the new Tom Selleck.  Magnum Long Island.  Yeah, that's me.  Magnum L.I., actually.  They describe the beverage and the clothing.  Yeah.  They describe, why would you say dark clothing? 
[01:04:00]  That is a description.  Right.  Why would you say, and not the race?  The race.  That way you know not to look for, if I, just based on this.  Oh, my God.  Saw a white guy walking around my neighborhood with dark clothing on.  I would be like, could that be him?  Could this be the guy?  So what are you going to do now?  What am I going to do?  You can't arm yourself.  Now I can't arm.  You're exactly right.  So I make sure.  You should train the kids, maybe. 
[01:04:30]  Train the kids to shoot?  Get a quick little army together.  Get a quick little kid army.  What are they going to put sticky hands on them?  They do that in the jungles.  It's like 12 years old, and they're out there fully armed.  Fully armed, just wandering around.  No, all I can do.  Taking care of business.  Is make sure the doors are secure.  The alarm is on.  Which, by the way, one of my house guests yesterday, mere hours after somebody kind of close to the area I'm living in, is shot in the face. 
[01:05:00]  One of my guests set off my house alarm.  Why don't you just make the children sleep by the door?  So if someone comes in, he steps on their face, and they yell.  You hear the yell?  Yes.  And it's like an alarm going on.  I have the house alarmed.  Fully alarmed.  First of all, a lot of people got Jim Norton's teabagging thing. 
[01:05:30]  Because people are like, you guys didn't even get what Jimmy was doing with the teabagging thing.  No, we got it.  Shut up.  We got it.  And then Tony from his Subaru.  It's today, Opie.  Anthony's going over the edge right now.  Quietly called the funny farm for him.  And then Lil Rudy from Boston.  Anthony, how many effing times are you going to explain your first gun story?  Oh, wait.  West Palm Beach.  Right.  That's why I have to explain that I was a cowboy.  My bad.  All right.  Can we take a break?  We're running late.  Yes, let's do that. 
[01:06:00]  So good luck to you.  Good luck, bro.  Happy hunting.  Good luck, bro.  Good luck, bro.  Thanks.  And by the way, just be careful.  Look for any human with dark clothing.  Any human with dark clothing.  A race not important in the description.  An earthling.  Yes.  In dark clothing.  Now, don't even mention that because that's not all inclusive for Jupiterians.  It could be a Venetian.  It's a human.  It's a human in dark clothing.  Shut up.  Cup of tea.  You liberal idiots.  Cup of tea. 
[01:06:30]  God almighty, the left has lost its mind.  Hey, we're getting a little too serious as we go to break.  Is Frank Brown around?  Frank?  I don't think that's important right now to mention somebody's face  because it takes more muscles to frown than the smile I once read.  Sometimes, if I want to be happy, I stand on my head and it looks like a smile.  Oh, because it's a turn that frown.  I have a disease.  Frank, turn that frown upside down. 
[01:07:00]  The pal talkers are with me, man.  That is the funniest thing, especially the face.  That freaking Frank frown, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Don't want to give everything away.  I'm not Frank frown.  I'm Frank the frowner.  Frank the frowner first.  Sorry.  Yeah, everyone's correcting me.  Is that Frank the frowner?  Yes, it is.  That guy almost shot myself with dad's gun. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, I thought he almost shot his dad.  Let's go to David in D.C.  Well, we're asking for the near misses because you get to see the tragic ones on TV,  but you've got to think there's a lot of near misses that are never reported.  Yes, David.  What happened there, David?  Oh, I love the show.  Jesus is like, I've been listening to you on XM for a while now.  Yeah, it happened like five years ago.  I was just screwing around.  I was like 10 years old, found my dad's gun, who knows, just a dumbass little kid, right,  don't know anything, see the gun, cock it back, and then, bam, drywall all over the face. 
[01:08:00]  I just start crying.  Dad comes home.  Oh, God, it was a mess.  Yeah, that's got to be the ultimate in pissing off your dad, man.  Oh, definitely.  ONA, love you guys.  Spread the virus down in D.C.  Spread it in the high schools.  Love you guys.  All right, right on.  Thank you.  Thanks, David.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah, the ONA virus spreading across America.  When we get back, Bob Kelly joins the festivities.  Ooh.  The star, in my opinion, of Torgasm on HBO every Sunday night.  Yep.  And a friend of the show.  Now we all know that O.P. and Anthony Wow stickers are your tickets to a successful 
[01:08:30]  Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow stickers have many other uses?  I sliced out both my kidneys, and I patched up the wounds with Wow stickers.  But, but, dude, how do you pee?  Oh, boy.  Can't pee.  This was incredibly nearsighted.  O.P. and Anthony.  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Gotta go pee.  Can't go pee.  Pee.  Dance.  Pee.  Dance.  Gotta go pee.  O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:09:00]  Let's get right back into it.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  In studio, our buddy, our pal, Bob Kelly, everybody.  Yes, Bob.  Bob's going to be part of our ONA traveling virus comedy event.  It's a weird name.  Let's be honest.  It's hard to say every time.  It doesn't really flow.  Next year when we do this, we've got to come up with a cooler name.  Bud Light presents the O.P. and Anthony traveling virus, the comedy event of 2006, coming soon  to a venue near you. 
[01:09:30]  We've got three dates.  Bob Kelly is one of the comedians that is going to be on the bill.  August 5th, Worcester Centrum in Boston.  August 26th, the PNC Bank Arts Center in Jersey.  September 9th, the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey.  That's across the river in Philly.  Tickets on sale now through Ticketmaster locations.  All the lineups are on the Ticketmaster.com website.  And our websites, we're very, very excited.  This is like eight to ten comedians.  Most of the guys you know and love from this show.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it. 
[01:10:00]  Yes, Jimmy.  Bob Kelly.  Billy, obviously myself, Opie and Anthony, of course, and Patrice O'Neill, and little  Bill Burr, as well as Bob Saget, Tracy Morgan.  And in Philadelphia, the Camden Show, we've got Don Marrera, Jimmy Schubert.  We also have for Jersey, we have Carlos Mencia, and Saget's on all the shows.  They're all great shows, man.  Bob Saget's calling our show today.  Oh, good.  And he is as dirty as they come when he's not doing that Full House stuff.  I know Full House has been off the air for many, many years.  But when he's not doing that family-type TV, he's in the comedy clubs getting as dirty 
[01:10:30]  as anyone else.  I don't think he's done family TV in, like, years.  True.  But, I mean, it's on every day.  Oh, I know.  Every day in reruns.  It's like it never went away.  It's such a goof now to see him in that context.  I met the twins.  Until you know him.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  That's okay.  I was just talking.  It's a talk show.  I'm a little, I'm not really a professional radio guy like you guys.  Oh, don't be scared, Bob.  Go in there.  Sorry.  Let me jump out of you.  I really did just step right on you.  Wow, I know.  A big Bob footprint on me. 
[01:11:00]  Two Jews walk into a bar.  They, hey, I want to eat some food.  Why'd the Paul across the road?  Well, he was.  You know, it was funny.  I was thinking about it.  At least I caught myself, though.  Oh, and it didn't wreck a thing.  I have no idea what I was just talking about.  Let's go with this.  Are you excited to be part of the tour there, Bob?  I'm ecstatic.  I'm a little nervous.  I mean, the Worcester Centrum is like, you know, this is a big.  These are big dates. 
[01:11:30]  These are big, big, and that many ONA fans in one big arena.  That's going to be.  And you're closing all the shows.  You're out of here.  And we got the ONA Village that is coming together nicely.  So it's going to be a very, very exciting event.  What's the ONA Village, may I ask?  It's so far, you know, like what T-shirt contest, maybe a stage for open micers and dunking boots.  And, you know, all our sponsors are going to be out there just giving away crap and you can buy stuff.  And, you know, think kind of like Lollapalooza. 
[01:12:00]  Are you going to have some of the free?  Did the first day of summer start and I didn't even know?  Oh, sorry.  I just wanted to know if it was the first day of summer when that was around.  Sorry if I stepped on you there, Bob.  So get your tickets through Ticketmaster.com.  And can we promote our website yet?  Because all the info is right there for everybody.  I would hope we can.  It makes it so easy.  All you have to do is click on a link and you're good to go.  You can see all the lineups. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  But whatever.  Pete emailed me yesterday.  He wants to do Cleveland.  We owe Cleveland a visit big time.  We certainly do.  We were this close to going to Cleveland when we got fired four years ago.  And we could bring this comedy tour to Cleveland.  It's up to us.  We were even closer to going to Boston.  Yeah, two days away.  We were on a whole trip.  Gene Simmons was going to be there.  That was going to be great.  Sorry, Wes Palm.  We don't explain that one to you at all.  Yeah.  We don't explain that.  You don't get an explanation.  No, not today. 
[01:13:00]  What do you think?  Should we do Cleveland?  Absolutely.  I think the ratings are good, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  People listening to our radio program and maybe-  They're talking like early September.  Okay.  Rover's a big morning show there.  He can help us.  We're in the afternoons in Cleveland, so he can help us if he's so inclined.  I say we go to Cleveland with the comedy tour.  Cleveland, we're coming your way.  That's right.  We're coming your way.  We'll have details soon.  And then Wisconsin.  Ooh, hey, slow down.  Easy, easy. 
[01:13:30]  You got to work your way up to these things.  All right.  Bob Kelly, the star of Torgasm on HBO.  Absolutely.  You're the reason I'm watching, my friend.  You're the reason I'm watching Torgasm on HBO.  What is this idiot going to do next is pretty much-  What a jerk you look like in that show, Bob.  Great portrayal.  Completely accurate.  That's who he is.  Just an ass and he's abrasive.  Awful friend.  Explain Torgasm really fast for everybody.  It was 40 days.  Dane Cook took me, Gary Gellman, and Jay Davis on a bus trip across the country for 30 days, 
[01:14:00]  20 shows, college, big arena shows, and they filmed the whole thing.  And supposedly we were supposed to get along, support each other, and have a great time.  You know what sucks?  Yeah.  This was Dane Cook's big dream, and you could tell by the second episode, he's like,  but this was supposed to be my thing.  Yeah, I got an image of what it was going to be.  Yeah, like it's just a bunch of pals on the road.  And why can't these pals get along?  Experience in America. 
[01:14:30]  He's got the big room.  It's set up perfectly for him.  He's got his name on the bus, and then it's just like, you could tell two, three weeks  into this thing, he's like, oh, this was supposed to be my thing.  That was actually supposed to be a living room.  And then Dane at the last minute went, you know what?  Can this be a bedroom?  He was supposed to be in the little thing with us.  Oh, really?  That wasn't going to happen.  He switched it into a queen bed suite with a plasma.  He saw what you guys were going to be all about.  Gary Goleman, 6'4", jammed into that bunk for 30 days. 
[01:15:00]  Just seeing a knee sticking out of the curtain, a fat foot coming out.  I got to tell you, I've never met the guy, but I've never hated someone more than Jay Davis  by watching this show.  Oh, you don't like him?  Why wouldn't you not hate him?  I don't like Jay Davis.  Like I said, I've never met him.  I've met just about every comedian out there at this point.  There's something about him that just gets onto your skin.  Out of anybody, I thought you'd like Jay Davis.  Yeah, right.  I started the show. 
[01:15:30]  You know what?  Hope's going to like you.  I'm like, go, Bob, go.  You guys were, the first episode, you guys were talking about porno, and he just was like,  is that all you talk about?  And it's like, God, relax, dude.  Yeah, I didn't, I don't understand.  Yeah, that's what we talk about.  What are we going to talk about?  What we really want to talk about?  You know, maybe fucking sneaking into each other's little crib at night.  Excuse me, Gary.  I was, he was just, I think he was a little sensitive.  He's from LA.  He's never been on the road before.  I forget, though, that I have, all my friends are creeps. 
[01:16:00]  I mean, not one of my friends has said one nice thing to me.  Ever, right?  Never.  You look good.  You lost a lot of weight.  I'll say that.  Oh.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Where's the insult?  Yeah, it's coming.  No, you're fat smashing, right?  Fat smashing, yes.  Well, I almost gave it up after I found out what's going on with that homo.  He's not Korean.  What's phase five now?  Yeah.  That's the real rapid.  It was proven that she was just babbling. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, sure.  Sure.  If you listen to the episode, the show they were on, they were actually fighting like  a couple.  Like, he came in and was taking over, and he was like, wait a minute, they're my friends.  We've got to explain to West Palm Beach.  Dr. Ian Smith's a friend of ours.  He's got a book, The Fat Smash Diet.  He's really good friends with Michael Strahan.  Michael Strahan's going through an ugly divorce.  So this bitch decides to kind of hint that Michael Strahan was a bit gay with our buddy,  Dr. Ian Smith.  It was on the front page of all the New York papers. 
[01:17:00]  You never want to wake up to that.  Yeah, that's something.  That's like, and most people saw it on the front page, and they didn't bother to read  the follow-up article the next day that was kind of a little more buried.  It was literally like one or two lines of this huge story about the divorce case that's  basically saying, you know, she kind of made that up.  Oh, flaming faggot football player and his TV doctor friend in gay love affair.  And then, yeah, the next day, page 19. 
[01:17:30]  Life says, not true.  It's like, what the?  Wait.  I think the Post and the Daily News owes it to these guys to make the headline as big  as possible.  But where's the huge headline from the other day?  Why can't that say I'm not gay?  These guys are not gay.  You just have pictures of them.  Because you know how we pick up the paper every day?  How would you like?  It's like, let me see what's in the news today.  Hey, look at this.  I'm a flaming faggot.  It's a good thing that's only on the front page of all the New York papers, because someone 
[01:18:00]  might see this.  Oh, is that just...  Believe me, it's all of our worst nightmares.  That's just evil.  Well, the only thing worse is, you know, congressman on pedo charges.  Right.  You know, that's like the only thing that you could pick it up, and it would be worse  for you if you weren't gay.  If you're gay, you know, then do what the mayor of Jersey did there, and just come out  and say you're a gay American.  You know what made it worse is that they're, you know, they're kind of, you know, too big  in shape black dudes.  Yeah.  That was kind of more uncomfortable, like a big black football player. 
[01:18:30]  But, well, there's this whole thing going on with the, you know, the DL.  You hear about the DL with the black guys.  And it's guys that aren't like overtly gay.  They're, you know, regular guys.  They're married a lot of times, holding down their manly jobs, and they have gay sex with  each other, and then go home to their wives, and they, you know, it's called being on the  DL.  Yeah, guys like Strahan and Dr. Smith, I mean, they're not gay, but you picture, like, both 
[01:19:00]  of them, like, in a locker room, maybe wearing a white towel around their waist.  A little snap in the towel.  Yeah.  You take yours off, and now you're just standing there in the locker room, no towel, nothing,  and just, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, and Dr. Ian, like, kind of arches his back and  puts his hand on the cheek and goes, oh, gee, you know, trying to get away from the towel.  Every step, the muscled-ass cheek ripples.  Right.  Hey, it's just, you know, because they're so in shape, rubbing cocoa butter on their stretch 
[01:19:30]  marks, trying to get that ashy skin nice and smooth, gay.  You know.  I like the fact on the show, too, the next, when he was on that day, he was like, yeah,  I love chicks.  Hey, Jimmy, what's that, my spirit, Cara?  Yeah, hey, Cara.  Hey, what's up, hot mama, baby?  Every commercial break, running up to the computer screen to look at the pal talk girls.  Hey, is she going to flash?  I don't know.  Why?  You want to say it?  We were testing him. 
[01:20:00]  For the people that weren't listening, he came in, you know, he was on the front page  of the paper.  He's a friend of ours.  He's like, I'm coming on your show immediately.  And he spent the whole day with us.  But we were giving him, you know, tests.  We were handing him bananas, see how he eats the banana.  And then we gave him the math quiz in the men's room, the urinal test.  Like, I purposely went in the middle stall to see if he would actually go to the right  or the left instead of waiting.  Obviously, if there's three stalls, you're the guy that goes to the middle.  You're the next guy to go to the urinal.  You're waiting, right?  Yeah, yeah.  If someone goes to the left or the right, then you could go to the other stall to always 
[01:20:30]  leave that one urinal buffer.  You need the one urinal buffer.  So we were testing him all morning.  Like, all right, come on.  We got to see for ourselves here.  I've never...  I'm like Norton.  When you go in the bathroom, he comes right next to you and looks at you.  Oh, he does.  He does.  He's got to take a peek.  I'll stand in the same one urine.  Why not?  Come on.  He's tried.  Let's lightsaber each other.  Dr. Ian Smith, though, the banana test, when he grabbed the back of his own head and pushed  it down onto the banana, I was a little suspect. 
[01:21:00]  I've never quite seen anybody eat a banana that way.  He mushed the banana between his teeth to make a gooey substance on the corner of his mouth.  He's going to come in here and kick all our asses.  I thank you to not use that kind of language.  I happen to have my young son in the car.  That's an attention getter.  Yeah.  All right.  So Bob Kelly, part of Torgasm.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  So you travel with Dane Cook for 40 days and they film the whole thing.  Yeah, they film the whole thing.  It was actually wasn't supposed to be on TV at all.  It was just supposed to be a DVD that we were, you know, he was going to sell.  But then he dropped his CD and sold half a million copies.  And, you know, HBO was like, hey, come over here for a sec.  And they just bought it to make him happy.  He was supposed to do his hour special with them.  And then they were like, oh, what is this?  And they were like, oh, let me check it out.  And they saw it.  They were like, oh, cool.  Let's throw this on, too.  And then they just, you know, HBO, they could have just thrown it together. 
[01:22:00]  You know, they got to go, you know, above and beyond.  And they've made it a nine episode series.  I mean, it got panned a little bit, you know, but it is what it is.  It wasn't, we weren't trying to, there wasn't that much comedy on it because you don't want  to see a bunch of, you know, four morons doing the same 20 minutes every night.  You know what?  You can see marshmallows only like four times.  I have to say this, though.  The show has been panned, but you're unbelievable in it.  You're the breakout star.  I'm telling you, it's not going to hurt you.  You're going to blow up because of this show. 
[01:22:30]  Because you come across so naturally and you come across like we all know you as an ass.  And you have no problem people seeing you as an ass.  Yeah.  You're not like putting on some thing for the TV.  What's that?  Sorry, I just always like watching the Billy Buckner play.  Never gets old, right?  It's been on TV like a lot for some reason.  Well, because it's 20 years.  Oh, it is.  It's 20 years.  That would be a reason.  And the Mets played in Boston there.  That's 20 years.  20 years.  I was in rehab.  Mets are doing very well.  I was in rehab that night. 
[01:23:00]  It was the first glimmer of hope I had in six months.  Wait, 20 years.  That was June of 86?  Yeah.  86, yeah.  That's the problem.  20 years coming this fall.  It's 20 years ago.  They did the World Series.  Rehab?  What were you, at 10?  I was not.  I was 15.  I was in rehab.  I remember six months before him, I was in rehab.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  January of 86.  Really?  That was crazy.  My wrist opened up.  Rehab at 15?  Your wrist opened?  What?  Rehab at 15.  Yeah.  I was 17.  What were you doing at 15, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches? 
[01:23:30]  No, I was drinking, but, you know.  Were you eating Star Wars figures and putting them on your bookshelf and making sure they  don't fall over?  Yeah.  I was drinking.  I was smelling the cape because it smells like plastic.  But it was, but I, at 15, when you're drinking, you don't go to rehab.  Every 15-year-old that drinks is out of control.  There's no 15-year-old going, give me a Manhattan, make it neat, and I just, just one.  I got to get home to the wife.  When you're 15, you're grabbing a bottle of Southern Comfort.  Whatever's around, right.  You're taking for the woods and drinking the whole thing until you vomit. 
[01:24:00]  Who, who goes, who at 15 is like, I think I have a problem?  Of course you do.  You're drinking at 15.  Jesus Christ.  You should have went to rehab.  Stop yelling at me like my second father.  Jesus.  Damn you.  No wonder I went to rehab at 15.  As you were shouting, Bob just distinctively started unbuckling his trousers.  I wanted to go in the closet.  He's yelling at me.  It doesn't matter at 15.  Wait, so let's ask these guys the question.  He went to rehab at 15.  Jimmy went to rehab at 17.  And I'm with Anthony. 
[01:24:30]  Like, all my friends and stuff, we were just finding what was in Dad's liquor cabinet.  Every kid should have been in rehab then.  Right.  So what, what is different than that that makes you go, I have to go to rehab at 15.  I woke up on floors of bathrooms from tequila at, at 15, 16 years old.  Right.  Like I was staying, I didn't even have a place to live.  I was like sleeping on a couch at a friend's house and just pounding tequila all night.  And I woke up in the morning on the bathroom floor. 
[01:25:00]  No clue how I got there.  That's cute.  But, but that's just a 15 year old drinking.  It's not rehab.  I woke up.  What, what happened?  I woke up, I mean, the same thing.  I woke up one day with no underwear on, on a cot in my friend's living room.  I didn't even know he had a cot.  I forgot.  I actually.  Private pile.  He found my underwear.  They hit you with soap in a sock.  They should have.  He found my underwear like a month later behind his couch with a turd in it. 
[01:25:30]  I just, I dropped a deuce in my tighty whities and I just hid it behind the couch.  At least you have the sense to do that in your stupor.  Yeah, there you go.  Because you could have just slept in it, which really would have been awful.  That was really funny.  Dude, I think, I think the difference between, I mean, did you almost die?  Have you been in the hospital?  Did you get like beat up to almost death?  I mean, did you go to jail?  I went to juvie jail.  No, I didn't personally, but I will say that when you're drinking to excess at 15, which 
[01:26:00]  doesn't take much, you know, things are going to happen.  You're going to end up in jail.  You're going to end up in trouble.  You're going to get, all right, I got in fights, things like that.  I wrecked a couple of cars.  Oh, wait.  Things like that.  But, but I mean.  He got in a lot of trouble at 15 and he had no choice, so.  Yeah, I was, I was like.  Oh, they sentenced you to rehab?  All right.  Then you got a point?  Yeah.  If you're sentenced to rehab.  I forgot the story, but there was, what was it again?  You were stealing stuff?  Yeah.  Like an armed robbery or something.  Armed robbery. 
[01:26:30]  That's right.  Right.  How do you know you've just blown it though at 15 that you're done drinking?  That's what I'm like, my point, unless you've been, you know, sentenced to go to jail, but  I mean, at 15, you can't identify that you've, you've pretty much blown your drinking, that  this is going to be you drinking at 25 or you drinking at 30.  At 15, you can't, you're not, you're going to know you're going to reach a point where  I think you, you get a reasonable take on how much you can drink when drinking is appropriate.  Not at 15. 
[01:27:00]  It's every weekend with your friends till the point where you pass out.  Like, I did cute stuff like that too, like your floor.  I remember one time I had a butcher knife and I ran out of my house and I was walking  down the street with it sticking out because I was hoping the police would shoot me.  And then the other time, I called the police department in a Jamaican accent and told them  to come get me, man, and put me in jail.  I was in a partial blackout.  And then there was perhaps the 30th wrist slicing incident where there was like 18 micro 
[01:27:30]  stitches in my left arm.  And I said, I was forced into rehab, but they were going to court order me if I didn't  go.  Okay.  All right.  There.  Point taken.  They explained themselves.  They explain it.  I completely concur.  There you go.  I was babysitting one night, woke up with my pants around my ankle.  Apparently, I went to go take a poo and I passed out and the poor kids were crying because  the babysitter was-  You passed out on the ball.  On the ground with my pants around my ankle. 
[01:28:00]  Be careful how you explain it.  Yeah.  With a dewy do.  We got it.  We got it.  We got it.  All right.  Yeah.  That'll never-  The actual substance will never make it through.  I almost-  Bobby used the restroom and Bobby used the restroom and his pants were down his ankles and  he passed out walking to the bathroom.  No, that's not what happened.  Oh, no?  You passed out.  No, he didn't sound like I'm a pedophile.  Sitting on the bowl.  I pantsed it down before I went to the bathroom and I'm babysitting?  You were sitting down on the bowl and you passed out.  I hope they're dumping out in such a way right now that it makes it sound like that you really 
[01:28:30]  are a pedophile.  I know.  That's what it'll sound like.  They dumped out the part that-  You're the only show that wants a pedophile on the show.  Well, you're talking-  I was babysitting-  Babysitting, pants down, kids.  Instead of all the stuff they dumped out that made it perfectly make sense.  Yeah, I was babysitting, kids, pants down, ankles.  Actually, you found me.  Ambulance.  Ambulance, police.  Whole room smells like pennies.  Rehab or jail. 
[01:29:00]  All right, we got to take a break.  Bob Kelly is here.  We got Bob Saget calling in in a few minutes here.  And we got to play the famous audio from Torgasm.  I guess this is the week of the episode too, right?  Huh?  What's that, a cat?  On this week's episode of Torgasm, our friend Bob Kelly breaks his knee, man.  Yeah, you guys-  Right?  I think.  Yeah, this is it.  It's the actually-  Oh, yeah.  They leave it at a cliffhanger, I think.  Ooh.  So they, at the end, it happens.  And then they cut to next week. 
[01:29:30]  It's kind of weird the way they do it.  You'll see.  You're going to be like, ugh.  They make it kind of soap opera-esque.  Oh.  I think there's an image of me holding, like they freeze frame as I turn and the crowd's  standing behind me.  And it's just like, you know.  And then they cut, like-  Ugh.  And then they cut to the siren.  They cut to Jay going-  A shot of the siren.  Yeah.  Jay going, why?  I just want to have a good time.  Come on, you got to love Jay.  Nah, she's cool.  Oh, it's a guy. 
[01:30:00]  Oh.  Oh.  You wouldn't know it by watching the show.  Ooh.  Oh, you know.  Wow.  Don't be a goose.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air. 
[01:30:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  ONA, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite.  Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, yes.  Yes, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The comedy ensues during the commercials.  We have such dopey conversations during commercials. 
[01:31:00]  Not the most unimportant crap.  Look at your phone.  It's as big as your head.  You can't stop saying size queen.  Yeah, size queen just makes us all giggle.  Size queen.  You know you're a size queen?  If you get a big one, and while you're working on it, you actually make this noise.  You just got to breathe through your nose. 
[01:31:30]  All right, listen.  You have the sinuses of Tony Soprano.  Bob Kelly's in studio.  This is very, very cool for Bob Kelly.  He's going to be at Caroline's in New York City all weekend long, right?  All weekend long.  The first time you're headlining at Caroline's, I believe.  This is it.  First time, yeah.  That's very, very exciting.  I highly recommend you go see Bob Kelly at Caroline's.  I've gone to a few Dane Cook shows, and Bob Kelly more than holds his own in front of a Dane Cook crowd. 
[01:32:00]  He's unbelievable.  Who else is with you?  Jay Davis.  At Caroline's?  At Caroline's.  He's the actual, I know, that was an abrupt ending.  Oh, wow.  I feel like I just got into a car accident.  It's Bob Kelly at Caroline's.  All weekend long.  212-757-4100.  I highly recommend you see Bob Kelly.  And I didn't hear you.  Who's warming up?  Jay Davis is actually middling to me at the show at Caroline's.  Jay Davis from Torgasm. 
[01:32:30]  Hope he, um, Jay.  David.  So make sure you get your tickets for Bob Kelly at Caroline's all weekend long.  212-757-4100, okay?  Yeah.  And this is going to confuse people, and it goes against what I believe in, but too bad, because we got Bob Saget on the phone.  So concentrate, people.  Bob Kelly, pretty much on his own.  Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City, okay?  That is happening, and we want all our fans to go down there and support Bob Kelly. 
[01:33:00]  He deserves it.  Bob is also going to be part of the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  We've got three dates.  Go to Ticketmaster.com for your tickets, okay?  And we have a great lineup of comedians, a lot of the people you know and love from this show, including Bob Saget.  Bobby?  I really want to work with Jay Davis.  I want to get that shot with caffeine in it.  You know, you heard that.  Oh, you heard that. 
[01:33:30]  I can't help it.  I got a whole, it's all lined up here.  I'm going to do it all.  You know, we heard rumors about Bob Saget for many years that he is a potty mouth.  And then he did our show, I don't know, a few months ago, and we hit it off with Bob big time.  And we had a great, great time, and we said, this guy has to be part of our comedy tour.  Well, I'm honored.  Thank you.  I have a sanitized strip over my lips.  And then yesterday on our XM show, Bob, because there's no way we could play it on regular radio,  we played your Aristocrats appearance. 
[01:34:00]  Damn, I was laughing my ass off.  Just the fact that you were laughing at how disgusted you are with yourself.  I wanted to stop, but they wanted me to keep going.  Oh, thank God.  Fear pressure, baby.  It got so awful, like uncomfortable.  Yeah.  You went to a place that was so bad.  I was crying.  I swear to you, I was crying.  I was laughing so hard.  I like the fact that it got so dirty that you finally just went into death. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  People had to die.  It was like an arsonist that had just poured gasoline everywhere and said, you know, I'm not going to light it.  I was like, come on, no one, no one lights a fire like you.  Yeah.  Strike the match, man.  Of course, you didn't rant.  How have you guys been?  Oh, we're great.  Very busy these days.  We're loving life, Bob.  We're big radio stars now.  Hey, are you on all three of these dates with us?  You're doing all three, right?  Yeah, I'm doing three of them, and they're at some time in the future.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  That's a good plug.  I'm very specific.  I'm like your arthritis.  And how dirty are you going to get there, Bob?  Well, I'm going to do my heart-rated stuff.  I'm not going to pull my colon out, and I'll do the harmonica with it or something.  You know, it's really hard to do that.  You can throw your back out.  You can hurt a kid.  That is a showstopper, though.  It does.  You can take out your colon and not clean it, but not play the harmonica.  Yeah.  The Aristocrats, I believe, is on DVD by now.  You've got to get it just to see Bob Saget, because you're going to be shocked at how dirty he got. 
[01:35:30]  And a lot of other guys that you would think would never get dirty did a great job with the Aristocrats movie.  Desmond Tutu.  I must have missed that part.  Wow.  I must have gone grab a beverage during that one.  Dude, as a comic, I have to ask you, were you waiting to say Desmond Tutu, or did it just hit you to say that?  I could not have loaded that up.  It just shot out.  Desmond Tutu. 
[01:36:00]  That was a gas propulsion.  I had no idea.  I don't even know what a propulsion.  Are you going to be on Entourage this season, too?  Well, they were just talking to me about that, so I think they were just saying, please, let's keep him off of it.  No, you were great.  Thank you.  Yeah, they did talk about it, because I just did what I did.  I hung out with hookers and smoked a bong, you know.  Yeah.  Nice.  That was sweet.  I showed that to my actual children before, well, the 40 that I know about, but I had a whole room.  It's great to have bastards, because you've always got an audience. 
[01:36:30]  Hey, Bob, I just, this is Rob Kelly.  I just, um.  You're great, man.  I know that, because the guys told me you were.  Yeah.  See?  We're honest.  I just met the twins out in L.A. at the club next to the Laugh Factory.  You met them?  I met them.  One is a little, one seems real, uh, they're gorgeous, by the way, so cute.  But one's a little, a little out of that, a little out of her mind, huh?  No, no, no.  See, here's the problem with this premise, is they're like, it's not like the Aristocrats, 
[01:37:00]  but I'm very close with them, so they're kind of like, uh, like kids to me.  So the only way I could, uh, they seem pretty good, actually.  I saw them last week.  But with talking about them, if it's me talking about them, it's like me going, because I have  like three daughters, it'd be like saying, hey, my, my oldest one's got kind of a funny  look in her eye, don't she?  Yeah, it's a little hard for you.  The second one's a little bit of a, second daughter's a bit of a hoe, but, uh, you know.  And let's be honest, you're not going to. 
[01:37:30]  If you're 19, you might want to tap that, you know.  Let's be honest, too, though.  You're not going to trash them, because they're billionaires.  I'm sorry, what?  You're not going to trash them, because they're billionaires.  You might need them someday.  It's not about money.  I'm sorry, you have to wait for the turnpike and all, but they're, they're good kids.  You know, they're, they're, they're, they're young women with a lot of dough, which ain't  no, it's not, I don't want to talk like I'm in mean streets, but it's not horrible.  A lot of dough.  Tell you something about those girls.  I grew up with them.  Yeah, what's he supposed to do? 
[01:38:00]  They're good dames.  He has Olsen twins conversations to the Olsen twins, so.  Play ball, anyway.  Well, I didn't say she was a size queen.  I just said that, you know, I know they, they were really nice.  They were super nice down to earth.  But one of them was like, came up and was a little, she had like a headband on and she was,  she's a little, they're still kids, Bob.  How old are they?  They're still.  They're 21.  Have you, they're 20.  They're not, they're not 21.  They're just 20.  Yeah, they're 20.  Oh, they're 20.  Oh, well, I was in, I was in, I was in a, I was in a 21 bar.  I'm sorry.  They're a little wacky at that age. 
[01:38:30]  They're still finding themselves.  I'm not famous.  They're still figuring things out.  I tell you, they're, they're actually, they're gorgeous.  You know, they never had a chance to really be children.  They never, what's up, Bob?  Love that old gank.  Neither did I.  Hold on.  Everyone's talking at the same time.  I apologize.  It must be this connection where I'm trying to protect my little bitches.  I love those girls.  A lot of girls wear a headband, by the way, which you want, so you don't need an ice pack.  You know, kind of thing a buffer is. 
[01:39:00]  Right.  Right.  It doesn't leave any bruises.  That's what I'm thinking.  Or sometimes if they're just annoying, you can just flick it and snap them seven or eight feet.  I was going through the channels the other day.  And, of course, I mean, the residual checks must just be wonderful.  They must just roll in every second for you.  What episode was it?  It was the one and the only reason I stayed to watch because it was the Disney World epic episode  where you all went down to Disney World, a multi-part little thing where you lost one of the Olsen twins there. 
[01:39:30]  And, my goodness, the words of wisdom you had on that show where you'd just sit the children down and that music would play.  Right.  And I think that's what gives you that image.  And that's what makes...  That's why I was down.  That's one thing.  Daddy needs to tell you something.  It's drafty.  He's taking his money out and paying off the guy in the Tigger costume so he can wear it, do inappropriate things. 
[01:40:00]  And he changes the name.  He takes off that T.  Hey, Bob, when you were doing those shows, because I know John Melendez, like Stuttering John, is doing Leno's show now.  So, like, he can't really go out and, like, do dirty stuff.  Were you able to go out and do your act?  They didn't really care if you went out and did clubs and did your thing and you weren't allowed to.  No, and I did both the video show and Full House.  When they were top ten, I had an HBO show, a special, and I dropped the F-bomb all the time.  But nobody seemed to care because I was doing what I was supposed to do on the other shows. 
[01:40:30]  Okay, they didn't...  That's weird.  You know, probably now they would have a problem.  Right.  Like, even though it's only a few years later, but I bet they would have a problem now.  You've got to keep that squeaky clean image.  Ellen does a real clean, you know, daytime show that she's pretty good at.  And then she does an HBO show, which still is kind of clean.  You know, it's still not...  Right.  Yeah, but if you came down on her...  That's a funny way to put it.  Uh, if you, yeah, came down on her, uh, about it, she would kind of, uh, it would kind of look like you're gay bashing. 
[01:41:00]  She would just dance.  So they kind of get like a, they were able to skate.  You're just a regular white guy.  So you've got the problems where if, you know, somebody wants to criticize, you really don't have a leg to stand on.  Well, I actually, I mean, I look like an accountant or your lawyer or something.  And then I come out doing the kind of humor that I always found funny, which is R-rated.  Like when I do your dates, it'll be like, and when I say your dates, I mean women that you've been doing.  That's how we bring. 
[01:41:30]  Well.  That's right.  Open up that bank book.  That's right.  It's a new show called Full Gullet.  I looked because I felt bad.  I didn't know.  I got one in, uh, on the 5th of, uh, of July.  I'm in, with you in Worcester or something.  Where is it?  Worcester.  Well, uh, 5th of July or, or August 5th.  Yeah, yeah.  At some point.  Whatever you want to get there.  Whatever you feel like.  Yeah, you show up when you want.  I'm sure that's fine.  You, you got that full house money, so.  You know, my, my act, I do it once. 
[01:42:00]  It's a snuff thing that I do.  So I don't know how I'm going to keep coming back because it's like, there's a cannon.  And I got a lot of metal parts.  Do you know what?  This is a funny thought I had.  What I've always wondered about snuff films.  When do they have the cast party?  Give me those ribs, you.  Yeah.  LOL.  LOL.  Well, it's one take.  And you don't worry about losing the light, you know.  Yeah.  You don't need, you don't need, what do you say, lunch?  Yeah.  Who are you saying it to?  You know, the guy's already been split by a couple tractors. 
[01:42:30]  Then they have a wrap party.  It's a carpet and then a trip down to the dump.  Yeah, it's a, it's a, you wrap up the carpet.  Right.  There you go.  All right.  Craft service is a garbage truck.  You know what it is?  It's a lot of letters to the family.  LOL.  You know, what do you want us to leave?  Do you want his costume?  You know, we could do the dry cleaning.  We got that in the budget.  Hey, Ryan on Long Island, he asked, well, he said he saw the full house outtakes and  it's kind of dirty for a family show.  No, you know, I didn't see it. 
[01:43:00]  I know Dave says you can, you can see my wiener in those pants, something like that.  Well, that's about it.  What is this guy talking about?  Ryan.  He was saying wiener on the.  Ryan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Well, I just, I just saw some of the outtakes.  Like he, like he had just mentioned the wiener in his pants and stuff.  And I just thought, I don't know, some little kids might have been a little wondering about  what was going on with Uncle Jesse and, or whoever it was, and Bob Saget. 
[01:43:30]  Well, he and I were hooking up.  That's in the outtakes, right?  Yeah, it's a lot of that.  And I'm like pulling on his mullet.  And I was like, I was so hot for the rippers.  Dude, what is, what's his name doing?  Who's the guy that you're with?  The blonde haired dude.  I met him.  Yeah, yeah.  Actually, Dave's got two shows on like, I guess it's like Discovery or.  Well, he was a big star with that skating show.  Yeah, he did the splits and he has good, he skated, he played hockey a lot. 
[01:44:00]  He did a big benefit for me for my, I have a cousin who's special and we did a big benefit  on Saturday and he performed.  He was very good.  He didn't skate or anything.  Hey, is he, is it true that Alanis Morristette's story about him, that that song was written  about him?  Well, I think it's written about three guys, but I was actually at his house when she called  him and she was always really nice because she actually came to the Setafel house when she  was like 12 or 18 or whatever it was.  12 or 18. 
[01:44:30]  I mean, that sure is a big difference that you better know.  That's my speech in court.  And so he, he, he just said, she just said to me, you know, I'm sorry to call you during  dinner.  She kind of sang it even.  It was like a lyric, like a lyric during dinner.  And he was starting to date to someone a little bit older than him, but she another version  of me.  Are you thinking of me when you blank her?  Yes.  But I don't, I don't, you know, she's a very talented lady. 
[01:45:00]  I've, I've seen her since she's, uh, I haven't seen her.  I don't, I don't, I would never ever, cause you know, it's my guy's ex-girlfriend.  I would never try to see her in that way.  You don't do that.  You don't go with, like if one of you guys split up with your wife, the other guy wouldn't.  It's the first thing you do.  You just jump right in there.  Grab that cash.  Is that in bad, is that in bad taste?  Like if your friend dumps somebody and you, and you grab her on the way home, you'll hold,  you'll pull her hair and go, you've been thinking about this the whole time. 
[01:45:30]  And you high five your friend and brag as soon as you drop her off.  Dude, she drank him.  I, I'm, I think you might be on to something good.  I think everybody should do that.  All right, Bob.  Well, we're very happy you're on these big lists, man.  Really happy to be.  Looking forward to it, man.  Well, you guys, I'm doing a thing I wanted to promote.  Sure.  Cause I'm in town next week.  I'm at the, uh, Newport.  Do you know about that?  Uh, Newport Yachting Center, July 7th?  There's a couple thousand people. 
[01:46:00]  It's, uh, July 7th at the Newport Yachting Center.  The Newport Yachting Center.  You can get tickets, uh, by going to the website, newportcomedy.com.  Where is the Newport Yachting Center?  Is that?  It's in Newport, Rhode Island.  I don't know if you can get there from where, you can get there from where you are, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, pretty easily.  Want me to pick you up?  We'd like that.  Well, we're also on in Boston, which is kind of, you know, half, you know.  The people will come from Boston, and I'm sure some will come from New York for that.  And then I'm doing the one more, this is my big host moment, which is July 8th. 
[01:46:30]  I'm at the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom.  And you can get those tickets through Ticketmaster.com.  Look at you.  But then I'm doing dates with you guys.  Thank you, by the way.  We're very happy.  Thank you.  Yeah, we can't wait to see you on that stage, Bob.  We're going to have fun.  I stand up.  I'm, like, going nuts now.  Like, when you guys, when I hung out with you guys, you could just, that was like the  beginning of the, that was the precipice of piss.  It was pressa without the press.  Precipice. 
[01:47:00]  And it's just fun.  I mean, I'm really, like, I saw Tracy Morgan, because I'm working on this Penguin movie I  saw him the other night.  He goes, man, we're going to be out tearing it up with Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  We can't wait.  We just can't wait.  All right, Bob.  We'll let you go for now, man.  Guys, I'll call you back really late tonight.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bob Saget, he's going to be part of the comedy tour.  We can't wait.  The Traveling Opie and Anthony Comedy Event of 2006, presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it to see all the lineups and all the dates.  Go to Ticketmaster.com or check out one of our websites that we can't promote yet, okay? 
[01:47:30]  Right.  All right.  More with Bob Kelly in just a bit.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says, big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip and Out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202. 
[01:48:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're all just very happy.  I don't know what's going on, but Jimmy's checking his messages or something,  and somebody's leaving a very, very long message.  Who's leaving a long message?  Girl, I think.  Two minutes and...  Oh, my God. 
[01:48:30]  Still going?  There's no reason for a message to be this long from anybody.  I know your number.  It's two and a half minute message.  From who?  Two and a half minutes.  Your sister?  Two and a half minutes.  Tracy.  Oh, my God.  She's still talking.  Still.  She's not still talking.  Stop it.  The message.  The phone even got tired.  It went, ah, right.  Still talking.  Oh, it's finally ended. 
[01:49:00]  My sister, I wanted to choke her last night.  You know how tired everybody was yesterday.  Didn't get much sleep.  We had meetings.  Things to do yesterday.  I didn't get home until really, relatively speaking.  Speaking of meetings, yeah, we left here at 3 o'clock,  and that roly-poly douche from downstairs that is a big-time security guard,  he's protecting us from al-Qaeda.  Or al-Qaeda, whatever the hell you call it.  Right.  He had to make sure, you know, he had to show everyone that his job is actually useful, 
[01:49:30]  that he's doing something.  I'm sitting in the lobby with all the people we met with.  We're working on a TV commercial for the Opie and Anthony show,  and I'm sitting there with my rollerblades, okay, my inline skates.  That's how I commute around Manhattan.  So I need somewhere to sit so I can put them on and then I can go home.  This roly-poly douche that thinks he's important comes walking up  and makes me look like a complete idiot in front of all these bigwigs.  Like, are you going to continue to sit on the steps? 
[01:50:00]  I'm like, yeah, I'm putting on my skates so I can go, you know, leave.  He's like, well, you're not allowed to sit there.  I'm like, you're such a roly-poly douche.  And we see you every morning, and I look at you every morning,  and I know that you're useless.  You're absolutely useless.  Another one of these freaking, you know, what are they called?  They're not security guards.  First line of defense is what they're called, Opie.  Should be given the respect that they are due.  He walks up to me.  It's obvious that I need to sit somewhere just to get my skates on. 
[01:50:30]  You can't do it standing up, so you've got to sit somewhere.  And it's almost impossible to sit anywhere in Manhattan, by the way.  There are spikes everywhere.  They've decided that, you know, New Yorkers should not sit down ever  because, you know, homeless people sit down,  and they don't want homeless people outside their buildings.  Good.  But I'm working my ass off, and I just want to sit and throw my skates on.  And roly-poly douche.  What is his name?  I'll call him out on the air.  It's actually RP Douche.  If he's out there today, I will say it to his face, no problem, 
[01:51:00]  when we do the walk over there.  That short aborigine?  Yes.  I hate him.  The roly-poly douche that wears, like, I don't know,  his belt has to be 50 inches, even though he's, like, you know, 5'4".  I can't wait until we go, where'd that guy go?  Oh, he has face cancer.  And then he felt so good about himself as he's walking away, like I told him.  I had to justify my lousy life and my lousy job.  Right there in the breezeway, there's stairs going toward 56.  So I sat there.  It's not even lunchtime, so there's no hustle and bustle. 
[01:51:30]  There's no one around.  He just had to come up and make a point that he's in charge.  Were you putting your skates on?  That's all I was doing.  And I looked at him, I'm like, you're kidding, right?  I thought he was joking.  I'm like, he goes, no, I'm not kidding.  Here's how you should respond to that.  Say to me, you shouldn't be sitting here.  Shut up, you fat douche!  Shut up!  You're a roly-poly douche.  That doesn't contribute anything to society.  How do you like them apples?  How about this?  This might be better. 
[01:52:00]  So you shouldn't be sitting there.  Okay.  So you should...  Die, you aborigine!  Die!  I am so sick.  That guy should be living in a grass home.  I'm so sick of these security people that are in these buildings that think they're important.  You're not important.  Let's look at him and all go, ugh.  Let's ugh at him today.  No problem.  I listen to the NYPD.  That is it.  That is the only authority in this city that I listen to.  The traffic people, when they're not the real cops and they have the vest on and they're trying to waive traffic, 
[01:52:30]  a lot of times I have to turn, I have to make a right turn on 57th and sometimes there's too much traffic there and they don't want you to turn,  so they wave everyone up and it takes you 15 minutes to 20 minutes at least to get back around the way you want to go  because New York City is insane with the streets.  Oh, the scumbag traffic?  So they go, yeah, they go, no, you can't turn.  I don't even look at them.  I continue making the turn.  Don't make eye contact and turn.  And they bang on your door.  And then I look.  I wave and go, yep, bye.  I'm halfway through the turn already. 
[01:53:00]  Bye.  I do not acknowledge them as authority figures.  You're as a, well, this guy's saying I'm not going to steal his crap.  Fred in Jersey.  Go ahead, Fred.  Hey, I hope you guys hear me.  How are you?  Hey, I almost stole your line.  I apologize, Fred, ahead of time.  Go ahead.  No, that's okay.  No, I call guys like that.  Every time I go into the buildings, I call them hallway monitors, and they hate that.  Hallway monitors, safety patrol.  Remember safety patrol?  They wore those white belt things with the little thing that went over the shoulder and the badge.  And they were like the narc as a kid. 
[01:53:30]  Even as a kid growing up, they were kind of cultivating you to know what life was going to be like.  That there was going to be this ass with some type of authority  and a little white belt with a strap over his shoulder and a badge,  and he's going to tell you what to do.  And he knew it was you, right?  He knew it was you.  Yeah, I've had it with these guys.  You're useless.  He recognized you.  He probably hates us.  Can we stand out there?  Let's all look at him today and go, ugh.  You want to just go, ugh?  I want nothing more. 
[01:54:00]  Okay, we'll do the ugh thing.  I knew this would make Jimmy happy because he's with me.  I can't wait to just do ugh.  Dude, I don't acknowledge them as humans.  By the way, Jay, roly-poly douche, eh?  That insult gives me the douche chills.  I think it's an accurate description of this fellow.  I think roly-poly douche is fantastic.  This guy's fat, and he has a nozzle on his head.  He's awful.  And he smelled like vinegar.  He sees me.  He knew it was you.  He knew who you were.  He was just power tripping you because he hates our guts.  Yeah, because I was around suits, and we're all leaving the building at the same time, 
[01:54:30]  and they're all doing that babble like, oh, it was a really good meeting.  We're very excited.  We can't wait to work with you guys, all that fun stuff.  And he comes waddling over with his roly-poly belly and says, are you going to sit there?  You can't sit there.  And he just goes on and gives me crap.  And I'm like, you're kidding, right?  Shut your mouth.  And he sees me throwing on inline skates, so that probably threw him back to some childhood memory  of someone actually telling him that he might want to exercise. 
[01:55:00]  Maybe it's, you know, women's choice, and no one picked him.  Ow.  How you doing?  Well, Bob, that was just mean, and we don't need that type of talk on this.  I just had it.  Can you let it bomb?  Every day they look you up and down like, you know, I'm in charge.  Are you really?  Exactly.  What are you really going to do if there's a real problem?  All right, what's the new name for us?  Every morning, do we see him?  Do we say, are you the safety monitor or the hoi monitor?  What's the most degrading thing we can call fat boy without being,  a fire erasing? 
[01:55:30]  Arrested.  A hall monitor?  And I hear he has like a wow sticker on his car and stuff.  Take the wow sticker off your car and stop listening to us.  Washroom attendant.  That's what Bob Grant used to call Mayor Dinkins.  The washroom attendant, absolutely.  I forgot all about that, though, because we had a really long day.  All I want to do is get my skates on and go home and commute home.  And this guy has to waddle up to me and make me look stupid in front of everybody.  He's just a jerk-off.  It's what he is.  It's what he always has been since childhood. 
[01:56:00]  He's a little fat nothing.  And then you got people like Ray.  He's just following orders.  Shut up, Ray!  Just following orders.  Well, that I kind of can appreciate.  Ray.  Hello?  Just following orders.  Are you kidding?  There was no one around.  No one cared that I was sitting down.  Obviously, I wasn't a homeless guy trying to find a place to sit for a while.  I needed to sit to put my skates on.  He could have let me slide.  He does every day. 
[01:56:30]  How about we go back to people assessing a situation and dealing with it instead of just  this whole blanket thing that has to be done.  No one gets to sit on the stairs.  How about the guy's job isn't so tough where it needs a blanket ruling where if it's a homeless  guy or some guy making trouble or some guy sitting there and falling asleep as opposed  to some guy who's putting his skates on who obviously isn't going to sit there with skates  on.  And who works in the building.  You make the distinction that, yeah, and he works in the building.  You make the distinction and allow him to sit there instead of just being this idiot 
[01:57:00]  that everyone is under one blanket here.  Right.  Right.  There's people out there that are on power trips all the time.  Yep.  All the time.  They have some stupid tiny little job that has kind of a weird power thing to it and they're  going to make sure they show that power every chance they get.  Go ahead, Ray.  What are you going to say?  But he might have a supervisor.  Oh, shut up, Ray.  And a supervisor might be busting his chops.  Now that might, you know what, though, Ray?  I mean, I understand your point.  Ray's a security guard somewhere.  Ray's got a blue shirt and blue pants and black shoes in the closet. 
[01:57:30]  Ray is one of those mall cops, aren't you?  Are you ironing your badge as we speak?  Ironing?  Polishing.  I'm going to polish on it right now.  What do you do for a living, Ray?  All kidding aside.  Yes.  What do you do for a living?  Mall security.  Uh, well, uh.  Honestly.  Yeah, I do.  I do security.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:58:00]  Stop or keep walking.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, that's terrific.  Die!  I need a situation where I can have a supervisor.  Shut up.  He's right.  Be a man.  Supervisor.  Tell your supervisor, that's Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  He walks every day.  He's putting his skates on.  You don't have to yell at your supervisor.  What is your supervisor going to say?  I don't appreciate that person sitting there.  You know, I saw somebody sitting there,  and you know we're supposed to keep the stairs clear of any people sitting there.  Shut up.  Exactly. 
[01:58:30]  Frank the Frowner will deal with that man.  Oh.  I don't appreciate you yelling at Opie.  He's very famous.  Thank you, Frank.  Do you know how it takes more muscles to frown than the smile I was recently informed?  Thank you, Frank the Frowner.  That's his new character.  We were joking yesterday, we need new characters on the show,  and he came up with Frank the Frowner.  Yeah.  I mean, it's actually Frank the Frowner.  Right.  Yes.  Wow.  I've never seen anybody's face actually go into their neck. 
[01:59:00]  Isn't that really something?  He plays the part very well.  Frank the Frowner.  I'm very happy to meet you, Frank.  I appreciate your influence.  But see, he stands on his head, and then he turns that frown into a smile.  I was born with a specific illness.  I can't smile, so I stand on my head to show my joy.  Wow.  You know my brother right now is working on a Frank the Frowner t-shirt. 
[01:59:30]  You do realize that, right?  Speaking of which, WOW shirts available through MyRadioStore.com.  They're beautiful.  Bob Kelly, Caroline's all weekend long.  We've got to get back to Bob.  We're hoping a lot of the pests and the faithful listeners of the show go to see Bob.  It's a big, big, big weekend for him.  It's the first time he's headlining at Caroline's in New York City here.  So, we encourage you to go see Bob.  Yeah, come down and see me.  Come down and say hi.  We've got to play your audio from Torgasm.  Oh, yeah.  The knee. 
[02:00:00]  This is the video no one has ever seen before.  They've only heard the audio.  Yeah.  So, you've got to watch for the video, man.  It's just great to watch this idiot hurt himself.  No offense.  Basically, he's on tour with Dane Cook, and they decide they need to play some touch football.  On a gravel pit, which is always good.  Which is ridiculous.  All lumpy, too.  It looks like it wasn't even whatsoever.  I've said it before.  Once you're out of your 20s, the football thing, just knock it off already.  We're out of your 30s with waist size. 
[02:00:30]  You guys had to realize someone was going to get hurt, right?  I quit.  This is the funny part.  I quit, like, 10 minutes before this to smoke a cigarette.  I went and got everybody water.  The water boy.  Yeah.  I was like, you know what?  I'll just do this, because you guys are getting a little too serious.  There was a Dominican guy out there that was getting a little crazy.  A ringer.  Yeah.  He thought it was soccer, the game of the foot, and started smashing people.  I quit.  This was the last play.  Someone said.  Of course it was the last play. 
[02:01:00]  They wanted to play more, but after someone breaks their knee.  This was the last play.  This was literally like they said, this is it.  Bobby, come in and play this last one.  Come on.  We need you.  So I'm like, all right.  I put my cigarette out, went in, and then jumped two inches off the ground, and my knee  became an ankle.  It hurt, right?  Did it hurt?  Yeah.  It hurt.  My knee went backwards and sideways, and you could hear the tendons just rip on both.  You really can picture the pain.  Yeah.  Backing up a little bit, in all fairness, Jersey Kev, Fort Myers, Florida. 
[02:01:30]  Hey, Opie, the security guard made you look silly?  Question mark.  Are you sure it wasn't the rollerblades that made you look silly?  Ah.  That is true.  I was going to say something.  You got you.  You're a grown man putting on rollerblades on stairs.  It's easy to skate home, man.  I was trying to sit there and put a bonnet in my hair, and he came over and scolded me.  A cop told me once I couldn't park my radio flyer wagon in that spot.  I just was cleaning my Chanel sunglasses.  My heart-shaped Elton John sunglasses. 
[02:02:00]  Now I can't talk without Stanley Frank the Fronter.  All right.  Here we go.  So here's the audio of Bob Kelly breaking his knee, man.  And we really thought it was funny when you asked another man to hold your hands, right?  Yeah, listen for the hold my hand.  Hey, did we find the Robert Kelly?  Oh, we had to clean it up, right?  That was the problem last time?  Nah.  Is there one we could play over here that was really good?  Do you remember?  Not yet.  All right. 
[02:02:30]  He's down.  You're way down.  Keep back.  Keep back.  Keep back.  Keep back.  He's still discussing the play.  He's screaming in pain.  I snapped my knee, man.  Oh, no.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Hold on.  Can I look at it?  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, dude. 
[02:03:00]  I broke my knee, dude.  I heard it break, dude.  Oh, no.  I heard my knee break, dude.  You made it just popped it.  You're going to be okay.  I broke my knee, man.  I can't bend my knee.  Did you?  Hang on, hang on.  I broke my knee.  I broke my knee, man.  Hang on.  Relax, relax.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Come on.  I broke my knee, dude.  Hang on, hang on.  I broke it.  Can you try to stretch it?  I broke it, dude.  I felt it crack.  Can you try to stretch it?  No, dude.  I go and move. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  Just relax.  Just relax.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't move it.  I'm in so much pain, dude.  I'm in so much pain, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Wait, wait, wait.  Can you get us some water?  You want some water?  There it is.  You want to try and turn on your side?  I broke that thing.  I broke it.  You're going to be fine.  I broke my leg, man.  Where does it hurt?  Below the waist.  Here's the sound. 
[02:04:00]  It bent backwards.  Does it hyperextend?  Is that why it gave me that?  Ah, the internet.  It's not just for downloading porn anymore.

Nobody's going to take responsibility for you.  You roll in your eyes and you act like this because you've heard it all before. 
[02:04:30]  You've heard it all before.  You don't know where the hell I come from.  You have no idea what I've been through.  Stop it.  You're not a victim.  I grow from it and I learn.  Take responsibility for yourself.  You know what?  Bud, what's your problem?  Bill in Waterford.  Even when Tyra's complaining, we say this all the time.  Even when she's complaining about someone else, she still makes it all about herself.  It always has to come full circle back to Tyra.  What about you, Tyra?  I actually know her.  The last time she cried like that was when someone flicked her hair and said, you're  not white. 
[02:05:00]  Actually, Dane gave me the same speech on Torgasm.  All right.  It's always about her.  I can't tell you.  I mean, I can tell you guys know just how hateable she is.  Yeah.  You're just an awful, untalented goose egg.  Most of these models, because she was adored for many years, Tyra.  But once they open that yap of theirs, it's over, Johnny.  Yep, yep, yep, yep.  Once that thing opens up and they start yapping about their life and how important modeling 
[02:05:30]  is in themselves, just all of it goes out the window.  Modeling is important.  You know what I mean?  I have tension that needs to be taken care of, so who better to look at?  Are you going to look at my grandmother's wedding photos again?  I can't still.  By the way, great timing on XM's part.  I'll get those back to you, by the way.

[02:07:00]  Ah, brand new microphones today.  I like this.  Wow, how about that?  With a big fuzzy black thing at the tip, just like Jimmy likes it.  Because Jimmy is a size queen.  Jimmy doesn't know where it is.  Where is it?  Uh-oh.  My phone is up.  Why are people touching my fucking phone?  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  I go to piss.  I leave my phone on the console and it's gone. 
[02:07:30]  Why?  I don't know.  It was right where you left it.  You knew where it was.  People just try to be helpful.  Where's the roly-poly guy?  Roly-poly douche.  I don't see him.  I wanted to go...  He's off today?  No, he probably got tipped off.  Oh, and he hid.  Oh, great.  So now we're in trouble for making fun of him on the radio, probably.  Let's get it.  Where are you, fat boy?  I want it to go...  Oh, we will.  We certainly will.  We'll get him.  We'll get him next time.  Look excited to see you. 
[02:08:00]  Couple of what?  Couple of months.  Jesus.  Hi, ladies.  Very nice.  Who are you?  I love you guys.  I do ya.  Thank you.  Oh, hey.  We got a cougar, everybody.  A cougar.  Ah.  South.  I have hunted you down.  Wow.  West Virginia loves you guys.  Do they?  Nice.  West Virginia?  Yes.  Every morning.  Well, say hi to West Virginia for us.  You're in New York just visiting, obviously. 
[02:08:30]  What are you doing in New York?  Tourist eating shows.  What show are you going to see?  Radio.  Are you?  Sorry.  Radio's hunting you down.  20-minute walk.  Hunting.  Was it?  Wow.  Be nice to the cougar.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  I like bitch butts and I cannot lie.  Ew.  She's touching me.  That's nice.  Ew.  Wait.  Are you having fun?  Ew.  The cougar touched me.  Thank you, ma'am.  You don't like that?  She just petted me.  Well, what's your name?  She's a fine lady. 
[02:09:00]  Of course.  I would be a great catch for the cougar.  Great.  Are you a New Yorker?  Actually, you're so cute.  Bobby likes hugs.  Hug Bobby.  Yeah.  I'm getting away.  She goes, argh.  I get away from any of this.  I don't want to be touched by her.  Wait.  Bob Kelly might make out with the cougar.  No.  On the tape.  Ew.  All right.  Go ahead.  Oh, God.  Is Bob kissing the cougar? 
[02:09:30]  Give me.  I'll give you a hug.  Oh, he's licking the cougar's cheek.  Wow.  Bob is really getting into the cougar.  Wow.  That was hot.  You liked that, didn't you?  Very hot.  Very hot.  Very hot.  Yes.  I'm sure my husband's listening out.  He'll love it.  Are you sweating in your blouse right now?  High beams.  High beams?  Nice.  Oh, if you saw the view.  I'm standing behind the cougar right now.  Her ass is so fucking horrible. 
[02:10:00]  Jeez, that's a big back to me.  It is this flat, like the typical mom ass, the old cougar mom ass she has on her.  Shut the fuck up because no one cares what you have to say.  Yeah.  I'm also looking at her.  It keeps her in shape.  Her cellulite arms.  Ow.  Wait, Obie.  Andrea Yates wants to say hello.  Andrea Yates.  All right.  Who are you?  I'm Pam McCullough.  And I just came with Mary because her husband's listening to your show every single day. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  See, I don't know.  I'm listening now.  What's that?  I said I just came with her because.  Did you?  Yeah, she was afraid to bring me because.  Was she?  She was afraid to bring me because she said you guys are a little crude sometimes.  Are we?  A little crude, no.  She's just kidding.  She's just kidding because she's a cunt.  I'm looking.  Jimmy, look at her pants.  You can see her panties through it.  They are gigantic.  Is that what they are?  They are fucking gigantic.  They're fucking Victoria's Secret, the pens.  She's wearing these black pants that are very, like, shiny black. 
[02:11:00]  And you can see, she is the most awful soccer mom looking piece of garbage.  She's the second worst ass I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, is that ass horrid?  My tongue feels like I just made it with my grandmother's ass.  She's got that.  What's her name?  A lot of makeup.  Oh, what?  Oh.  Hey, Mary.  Oh, you nailed it.  Did she look?  Yeah, they're looking.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  Ew.  She just kissed her index finger and went.  Oh, did she do the hot, like. 
[02:11:30]  Ass thing?  She's fucking awful.  Her ass is like raw chicken and cottage cheese.  She could do the thing with her ass because it looks as flat as if it came off a griddle.  I like her friend with the cancer wig.  Her friend is awful.  What a dyke.  Jesus.  I would fuck Sam in the mouth before I'd hold hands with either one of them.  All right, let's get out of here.  Let's move on.  Let's start our little walk.  Text them.  Wow.  Anybody else want to say hi today? 
[02:12:00]  What a surprise having that cougar step up like that.  There we go.  That was horrific.  All right.  Who are you?  You're not going to kill us, right?  I'm not going to kill you.  John.  Where are you from, John?  Jersey.  Jersey, right on.  I'm from Jersey.  First time you're doing the walk with us?  Yep.  Yes, sir.  All right, cool.  Thanks for checking out the show.  Nice.  There we got some guys doing some sheetrock work.  Very hard, huh?  How do you do that?  Hi.  How are you, sir?  Very good.  Coming to work, help me. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, when's that visa expire?  Pretty soon?  You got the work visa?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Work visa, when's that expire?  Oh, that expired a while ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't worry.  Oh, migre!  Migre!  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding, of course.  Don't run.  Get the job done.  Okay, Pablo.  It's job.  You guys only do the jobs that regular American people don't want to do.  Like, you know, high-paying construction jobs.  Of course.  Have fun, gentlemen.  You bring that up.  Adios.  That's some heavy sheetrock there that they'll be moving. 
[02:13:00]  Adios.  Jesus Christ.  How come everybody says it's always jobs no American would want to do, like picking corn  or something?  And these guys are doing construction jobs that would pay a lot of money to a normal, you  know, white guy.  Frank the Frowner wants to interview somebody.  Oh, Frank the Frowner wants to interview somebody.  Okay, that's a good idea.  Hi.  We're taking a quick poll.  Would you be happy to talk to us?  Who are you?  I'm Frank.  Hi, Frank.  We'd like to know the average New Yorker how long have you lived here. 
[02:13:30]  I don't care.  Wow.  Frank the Frowner, you gotta get...  Frank has got quite the short temper.  Frank.  Maybe it's because he can't ever show that he's happy.  Yeah, Frank.  Even if he is.  Frank, try to interview this lady on the cell phone.  Here we go.  Frank the Frowner.  Hello, mister.  My name is Frank.  Who are you talking to?  Oh, Jesus.  He scared the living shit out of her.  She jumped, spun around, and ran away. 
[02:14:00]  The face he makes.  Oh, it's scary.  That has to get on the website to get the full effect of Frank the Frowner.  How about this lady, Frank?  Okay.  Hello, mister.  My name is Frank.  Can I interview you for the radio?  She completely ignored you like you weren't there.  I was like, Frank, the operation.  Oh, God damn.  That is funny.  The people don't know how to react to you.  All right.  We got a guy walking his dog across the street. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, a guy?  Okay.  That is one old queen.  He looks like the guy in the fucking boat in the Goodfellas picture.  Oh, he does.  Hey, he looks just like him.  Hey, the dog's looking that way.  He's got shit in his hand.  What do you want from me?  Yeah, you don't want to piss off a guy with a handful of dog shit.  Yeah, exactly.  He has a better weapon than your microphone.  He was carrying a bag of shit.  How about this old lesbian, Frank?  Hello, miss.  I'm doing interviews for the radio. 
[02:15:00]  Would you care to do an interview for the radio?  It's about...  She'd rather walk into moving traffic than speak to you.  One to your left.  Miss, you with the Rosemary's baby hairdo.  Oh, my God.  Oh, she's shaking her head.  I don't care.  I was just trying to ask you a question.  She is not happy.  How long have you been the attorney general?  Bob Kelly's instigating.  Bob's instigating, yeah.  Bob is talking to her.  Bob, Bob.  He's probably calling Jimmy an asshole.  Bobby. 
[02:15:30]  He's trying to pick her up after all the luck he had with the cougar.  Be careful, too, because it's...  He's in New York.  Yeah, he's in New York, you've got to be careful.  Guys like that are loopy.  Well, I've been through a long time.  Oh, yeah.  She's the fucking voice in New York.  Yeah, exactly.  Shut up, stupid.  I've been here a long time.  It's not my first time at the rodeo, boys.  Listen in, Bob.  What do you live? 
[02:16:00]  Married?  Huh?  No.  I just wondered if you wanted to, maybe.  Excuse me.  I'm single.  You, the social studies teacher at the floods.  Cunt.  Cunt.  Are you cunt?  Bob is trying to pick her up.  Hey.  Very nice.  Good job, Bob.  Hey, I like the new microphones, by the way.  Yes, excellent.  Yeah, these work very well.  We love them.  They sound much, much better. 
[02:16:30]  They certainly do.  Oh.  This fat moon face.  What a mess.  I want a smoothie.  Anyone else have anything?  Everyone's good.  Everyone's good.  No plugs, nothing.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks for doing the work, guys.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll continue in just a few minutes.  Back.  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves.  Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the FCC be able to touch them this time? 
[02:17:00]  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made.  Police are still investigating.  We're all in it.  We're all in it.  Ah!  Let's do it!  The blonde one.  These so-called radio shots.  Our society needs borders.  These parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope. 
[02:17:30]  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Shot.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation  that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:18:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:18:30]  Frank the Frowner is a hit.  Let's just be honest with each other.  That is a massive hit. 
[02:19:00]  We're all getting situated in the XM studio.  Who doesn't love Frank the Frowner?  He's my favorite new character.  Isn't he great?  All right.  Try to get the old Al talk up, and I'll be there in a minute, people.  Report says nursing home plagued by sexual, physical, and verbal abuse. 
[02:19:30]  Where's that story, by the way?  We've got to do that one today.  Yeah, I read about that.  You live your life, and you just want to end with some kind of dignity.  Dignity.  Just a little bit.  There's no time for dignity in this world.  Just a little bit of dignity.  Enough.  You did things.  You were young once.  You'll look at old people on the news and try to picture what they looked like when they  were, you know, young.  Because, you know, like old Gertie is like 85 years old, shitting herself in the old age 
[02:20:00]  home.  She was once full of life.  Fucking.  Had a gig, you know.  Had a job.  Welcoming the doughboys home.  A couple years ago, I had to spend a lot of time in a nursing home, excuse me.  Yeah, you get some chicks.  And the people that work there are just people that...  have no other options.  They're miserable.  They don't want to be there.  No one wants to help.  They don't want to be taking care of old people or people that need the services of the nursing 
[02:20:30]  home.  It's a job.  It's really sad.  You see these older people getting treated badly.  I'm sure there's some out there that are doing a fine job, and they really care and  do the job right.  But there's also a lot of people just should not be working around old people.  Some fat-bearded male nurse.  That's the last thing you see is him with a pillow leaning in, and he's whispering,  it's all going to be okay soon.  It's okay.  I'm the angel of death. 
[02:21:00]  Yes, you are.  You live through...  Homo.  You live through Korea, Vietnam, your kids growing up, and you're killed by a fat homoerotic  man in white shoes.  That's the whole thing.  When you see some of these war heroes, and they have Alzheimer's, they're in the home,  they're on their little rascals or something, and just like, could I get changed here, please?  Change me.  Or they're just yelling.  I had to do a job once in an old-age home when I was in construction, and doing a renovation, 
[02:21:30]  and you just hear from the other side, help!  Help!  Help!  And one of the workers there just going, Mr. Anderson, please.  Please keep quiet.  There are people here trying to do things.  Because he just yells help for nothing.  Like, all of a sudden, he's on Iwo Jima.  Help!  He's pinned down by the Japs all over again.  And the poor guy, he's been through all that, and how is it going to end?  Not with machine gun fire, with a zero coming at him, strafing him on the beach, him and 
[02:22:00]  his buddies trying to knock down one more, so it's a little easier for the next bunch  of boys that come over.  No.  It ends with a lump of shit in his fucking drawers, and that last breath, not knowing  where the fuck he is.  Welcome to life.  And a guy who looks like Yafet Kodo, turning him on his stomach, and raping him, and choking  him simultaneously.  Oh, God!  How did this happen?  His old man johnnies are pulled down to his ankles. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, God.  He remembers his buddies he lost in the Great War.  They're all young, full of energy.  Viril?  Viril.  Died much too young, but at the hands of the Huns.  They died in glory.  Right, in glory as heroes, pictures of him, all they'll ever be are pictures of him as  young men.  And there he is.  Why are you doing this to me?  A black thigh on either side of his ass cheeks, an intense physical pain that he's never experienced, 
[02:23:00]  and a lot of old man confusion.  There's a guy over and giving some other guy the rules on how to fuck him.  You can fuck him in the ass, but no cumming in his ass.  Yeah.  His family comes on Tuesday, so don't ever fuck a Monday night because he complains.  Last time that cum dripped out of his ass, and his son found it and almost got in trouble.  We barely explained it away.  He throws him a rusty can of Vaseline.  The old man can't communicate. 
[02:23:30]  All he can yell is help.  Help.  The kill Bill scene is great, man, when the guy's describing how to fuck her.  All right.  I'll give you a little time.  That's the best.  Here's the story, by the way.  Horror show at Old Folks Home.  Horror show.  Staten Island's Eager nursing home is a horror of sexual, physical, and verbal abuse for patients,  and top administrators never told authorities what was happening.  A bombshell state report charge yesterday. 
[02:24:00]  The report cites at least 28 incidents of one patient abusing other residents on the fourth floor dementia unit.  The dementia unit.  Now there's a party.  The dementia unit.  One patient.  Incidents that were never investigated or reported to the state health department.  I'm being fucked in the ass.  Sure you are.  No, we're just taking your temperature, ma'am.  There's one go-getter patient that had sense enough to know,  I gotta pull this off in the dementia ward, 
[02:24:30]  because they won't believe one of these old kooks.  Well, they would only get half the story right.  He raped me, and then he turned into a bat and flew away.  All right.  Thanks for nothing.  If they can only stick to the story.  He put his penis in my mouth.  Then the mothership came.  Did it?  Who blackens your eye, ma'am?  Batman did!  It was Batman!  But he was a Negro!  All right.  I'm sure he was.  All right.  Swallow this pill. 
[02:25:00]  Higher-ups in the privately owned institution covered up the incidents,  claiming they were typical of dementia patients, not abuses.  All right.  Let's go to Mike in Arizona.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, damn Mike.  What do you say, Bill?  I've never gagged listening to your show until right now.  You guys are freaks.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I'm just gagging.  The last line of the article is,  the inaction by the home's officials violated seven health regulations.  The report said. 
[02:25:30]  Health regulations.  You just know.  Seven.  One patient abusing other residents of the fourth floor dementia unit.  So this one patient figures, this is perfect.  All right.  Punch someone.  Just walk up and punch someone as hard as you can right in the face with impunity.  It always occurred after Yankee losses.  Jeter strikes out.  He just takes out his frustrations on the old folks, or as he called them,  punching bags one for 20.  Punch them in the face.  And if they go, is it Jell-O time? 
[02:26:00]  And then you fuck them in the ass.  Jesus.  Jeremy in Missouri, what's up?  Hey, I used to be a caregiver, I guess is what they call them these days.  No, you were a male nurse.  Failed nurse.  Caregiver.  A male nurse.  You can make it sound as cool as you want, but you were a male nurse.  You're an asshole wiper.  Go put your white shoes on, you clogs.  It's not shit.  It's just mud.  Just think of it as mud.  What do you think about when you're ragging down an old lady in a shower? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Skin's hanging off like a doily.  Oh my God.  I have told my wife so many times, we got the fuck now while we're young because I know  what it's going to look like now, years from now.  You know it's going to be like a Sharpay pussy.  Oh my God.  It's like a hush puppy with water dripping off of it.  Yeah.  But, hey man, I've got to tell you, it was horribly, horribly frustrating.  Took care of Alzheimer's patients.  These people would come up, think you were their worst enemy, smack at you, call your 
[02:27:00]  names, throw food at you.  We had one little lady on the unit who used to literally throw shit like a monkey.  Great.  You walk into a room.  Isn't that wonderful?  Hi Agnes, how are you?  Slam the door because you're a big handful of shit.  How do you not want to punch him?  How do you not want to just punch them in the face?  I would have planted my foot right in Agnes' twat.  Got to straighten old Agnes right out.  Maybe I shouldn't throw shit because what I do, I get a nurse shoe in my pussy.  Even someone with dementia can figure that out.  We had a bunch of walnuts disappear. 
[02:27:30]  Is that what you called?  Oh, I thought you called them some of the patients.  Those are the ones that were shy.  Those are shy mental patients.  They just stand there facing the wall.  Hey, look at the walnuts.  Gather up all the walnuts and get them to bed.  They were wallflowers in high school.  Anthony, this one's for you.  They disappeared from the arts and crafts room, little walnut shells.  You know, they decorate them, put little eyeballs on them, little things and crap.  Well, about a week later, I was putting this woman's toothbrush up when we were getting ready to put her to bed. 
[02:28:00]  And there's a bunch of whole walnuts in her drawer.  And we're like, well, we would find food in the rooms.  We've got to throw it away.  Right.  So I opened up a trash bag that I had in my little scrubs pocket.  Scrubs.  And opened it to the drawer.  Just started pouring these things into the trash bag.  Well, as they hit the floor, through the bottom of the trash bag, they crack open.  Chocolate sinners, but this was the same woman that used to throw her shit. 
[02:28:30]  They were literally packed with shit.  And she put them back together.  She threw them in her asshole like a squirrel?  No.  So they were two halves, and she put shit in them and then closed them up?  Yeah.  And then put them in the drawer to keep them the same.  All right.  We're done with this guy.  What did you do after you killed her?  Even the family can't get mad at you.  Look, I love my parents, but if either one of you ever packs a walnut with your feces,  I'm hiring someone to kill you. 
[02:29:00]  You're not my parents.  You're my parents.  By the way, Eric is not happy.  Eric.  Oh, no.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What do you say, Eric?  Thanks for calling.  Let it out.  Let it out, Eric.  Let it out.  Let's go.  What the fuck are you guys thinking, man?  I mean, come on.  Like with the war vets.  I mean, these guys served our country.  Yep.  You know, fought tyranny, and they can't help the way they are.  I mean, come on.  Amen.  Don't you think that's my point?  I'm saying it's a goddamn shame that these guys did what they did and then had to go out like that. 
[02:29:30]  But you're saying, Eric, they shouldn't be poked fun at like that.  No, not really.  I mean, what are you guys going to do when you get that A?  Absolutely.  Don't you think?  Be fucked by male nurses.  That's right.  Hopefully, if we're attractive enough.  Anthony and I made a pact a long time ago that we're going to take each other out.  You guys are fucked.  Opie will be gone.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  He just hung out.  And they won't know what Opie's talking about.  E-Rock.  Be yelling for people.  People will like it when we give them like a taste of reality. 
[02:30:00]  No.  I mean, that's exactly what happens.  You like to think you're going to die romantically or whatever.  But no, it's going to be something horrific, unfortunately.  Look, Eric, here's the thing.  Eric, call back.  No one gets the cancer music as you're lying in an open bed overlooking the ocean in Hawaii  as you take your last breath.  Oh, what was that?  E-R.  We all wish.  We never watched it.  We all wish we could go out that way.  Where Goose from Top Gun was sitting there. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, which way do you think he wanted to go out?  Hitting the canopy that didn't eject right?  Or sitting there with cancer on the beach in Hawaii?  Yeah.  Oh.  This is like the cancer song.  It isn't real this guy's name.  It isn't real something.  Big fat Hawaiian guy is dead.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  It's a good tune, right?  This guy's dead?  Yeah.  He's dead.  Did they play this at his funeral?  No, his health wasn't allowed.  Cut that shit, sonny. 
[02:31:00]  Was he like a big Samoan or something?  I think he was a big fella.  Sounds like a fat ghost.  Stupid song.  A fat ghost.  You can hear him breathing.  Listen.  No, wait.  Listen.  Oh, you missed the beginning.  We were going, this one's for Gabby.  He dedicates to someone.  All right.  Let's move on.  All the stuff you got up. 
[02:31:30]  James in New Hampshire.  James.  I want that guy Eric to call back, dude, because you actually did make a good point.  Yeah, definitely.  James?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, I got a bit of a call back from Mantown for you.  Yeah.  If you remember the other day, we were talking about Warren and Blue Oyster Club and everything  not playing to the crowds they used to?  Yeah.  Well, Mantown is currently giving away a prize where you can win the band Extreme playing  in your office lunchroom.  Why didn't you call the first half of the show?  I just got in my truck and heard it because I don't have XM in my truck. 
[02:32:00]  I just heard it and I had to call first thing.  Please call us tomorrow and remind us.  That would be a lot of fun to do.  Put that on the sheet for tomorrow.  Yeah, definitely.  I will do that first thing?  Yes.  Or do you want it later in the show?  You let me know.  As soon as you get up there, sure.  All right.  I'm here for you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, James.  Flag-burning ban failed in the Senate.  Thank goodness.  Yeah, it should have actually.  What?  It should have failed. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Flag-burning ban failed.  You can't ban it.  You can't ban it.  You can't burn a flag.  No, you can't.  It doesn't make people happy, but you can't start.  You can't ban it.  Flag-burning ban failed.  I'm trying to figure it out.  I understood it.  Now you've fucked me up, Anthony.  The ban to fail.  You can't ban it.  Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.  They're closer or they appear closer?  Wait a minute.  What the fuck is it?  They're freaking staring at me and hypnotizing me.  Wizard eyebrows.  I'm a wizard.  It doesn't make people happy when that happens, but. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, this one is one that Schumer and Hillary Clinton were right about.  You can't ban it.  So you can burn one.  You should be able to burn one.  You should be able to burn one.  I agree, yes.  I like when they burn the flag and they forget that it's like, you know, plastic and it starts  melting on their hands and they go, ah, ah, right at the end.  Oh, more than ah, ah.  There's been videos on the web that's funny to watch.  A guy burning a flag and with using gasoline, some Iraqi, and it got on his leg and he lights 
[02:33:30]  it and it just lights his whole leg on fire and he's running.  He goes running off and the crowd runs after him and he's on fire.  That's hilarious.  Glad that worked out for you.  Oops.  All right, on to other things.  Have it.  No, no, we don't want to do this.  What?  Shit.  It's not the teen that didn't miss a day of school.  Oh, great.  It's a feel good story.  All right, well, we can goof on it.  There's a better story though.  Where the hell did it go?  This one?  I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah, sorry.  Okay.  And a teenager from Staten Island gets an A for attendance. 
[02:34:00]  The high school grad has not missed a single day of school since 1994.  Fox News, Linda Schmidt has his story from Newdorf.  You hear about these kids every year.  And you know that it gets to the point where they have to go to school even if they have  the flu because they're trying to keep their record alive.  So they get everyone sick.  Yeah, so they get everyone sick.  I used to take that lunch money.  You were?  You did that?  I used to wait at the end of the line.  You know, it was like 85 cents for lunch.  I used to take everybody's 15 cents.  And then I used to make like three or four bucks a day. 
[02:34:30]  And then go buy like a nice half a pint of whiskey.  So distracted.  Sorry.  You can't show a goddamn baseball.  I don't know why ESPN is on all the time on this thing.  They just showed that play.  Who was that?  No, it was a different one.  Different play.  What were we talking about?  I have no idea.  They were watching baseball and it was a call that the ump made and said the ball was  either fair or foul.  I don't know.  But it was like right on.  What happens when it hits the line?  It's fair.  It's fair.  Even though they call it the foul pole. 
[02:35:00]  Because it hit the line and you saw the little poof of the line they put down.  And someone didn't agree with the call.  They discussed that crap on sports radio.  Oh.  Ad nauseum.  Of course.  I love that saying.  Ad nauseum.  Why is it?  I used to say ad nauseum.  Ad nauseum.  I thought it was ad.  Is it ad?  Ad.  Because you got to add the throw up?  Ad nauseum.  Oh, I'm dumb.  I can't say.  Why is it called the foul thing?  Why is it called the foul pole if it's fair if it hits it? 
[02:35:30]  Oh, who gives a shit?  We have a fair pole.  Ad nauseum.  And no one drives me nuts about baseball when they say he had eight RBI.  RBI, yes.  Why is it not RBI?  Runs, bat it in.  It just should be RBI's.  It was RBI, but if it's not runs, bat it ends.  I know, but it was just the accepted thing for so many years.  And then some do-gooder out there that was perfect in English class decided to change it for everybody.  Okay.  So then you get the sports announcer going, hey, that's five RBI. 
[02:36:00]  It was RBI's growing up.  Five RBI's.  RBI's.  Can you say fluranthropist?  Fluranthropist.  Oh, my God.  What are you trying to say?  Fluranthropist.  Philanthropist?  Like charitable?  Can you say it?  No, but I can say get the fuck out.  Yeah.  What's that mean?  Fluranthropist.  Philanthropist.  No, because I can't say it.  Philanthropist.  Philanthropist.  Yeah, I can't say it either.  Say Phil.  Philanthropic.  Phil.  Phil.  An.  An.  Thra. 
[02:36:30]  Thra.  Pist.  Pist.  Phil.  Phil.  An.  Thra.  Thra.  Philan.  Philan.  No, Philan.  Philan.  Philan.  Hang on, let me.  Phil.  Philan.  Philan.  Philpist.  Philanthropist.  Hang on, fluranthropist.  Fluranthropist.  Holy shit.  Bob, you were dumb as they called it.  I love the last part of the word, pissed.  Say it again.  Fluranthropist.  Wait, no, I can't say it.  Wait, wait, let's.  Philanthropist.  Philanthropist.  It's contagious retardation.  Bob, without thinking, just say the word now. 
[02:37:00]  Fluranthropist.  Fluranthropist.  You hear it together?  Philanthropist.  Hang on, hang on.  Philanthropist.  Philan.  Philan.  A fluranthropist.  I'm making.  You're fucked now.  How do you say it?  I'm making philanthropist.  I'll think it's awesome.  You're saying fluranthropist.  I'm a philanthropist.  It's a fluran.  It's fluran.  It's a philanthropist.  I don't like philanthropists.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Frank the Frowner.  Yes.  I don't like philanthropists.  Why?  They help people.  Frank the Frowner says no to philanthropy.  Because no one's ever helped me get my operation. 
[02:37:30]  What's the operation you need?  It will help fix my face muscle.  Do you know it takes more muscles than frown that does to smile?  I once read.  You told us that a couple of times there, Frank.  Break the Frowner's head.  Breakout character of the year.  We all wanted that dude.  New character, Dave. 
[02:38:00]  Well, we can't now.  No, there's no top in it.  He just knocked it out of the car.  That's got to be the funniest thing.  Oh, his face.  So anyway, getting back to the kid that didn't miss school.  Well, here's the report, I guess.  Well, the young man that we're talking about is graduating from high school today.  And what he's going to be doing is receiving an award for not missing one day.  That's right.  You heard me right here.  He hasn't missed one day of school from first grade all the way through high school.  What do they hand you for that?  A broad douche.  You didn't miss a day of school for how long? 
[02:38:30]  It came out to about 1,960 days consecutively.  I've got to give you a hard time about this.  What is wrong with you that you never wanted to miss a day of school?  No friends.  Well, for a while, I didn't really notice that I wasn't missing any school until the middle  of my middle school career.  And then after a while, I realized, you know, I haven't missed a day of school.  Why don't I keep going and see how long I can take it?  No.  You know what this is all about?  Another person that loves the attention.  Attention getter.  Some teacher somewhere just casually said, you know, I've been looking over my records 
[02:39:00]  and you haven't missed a day of school yet.  Perfect attendance records.  A light went off in his head, bing, this is going to be my thing.  It'll be my thing.  Everyone in school probably goes, there's the guy.  He hasn't missed a day of school yet.  Look at him.  He's right there.  Where is he?  Oh, the one being punched.  That one.  Yeah.  The guy up against the lockers.  Throw darts at him.  Especially high school, the best thing was to skip a day of school just out of nowhere.  Yeah, random day off from school is the best thing ever.  I used to cut all the time.  Sometimes we would go and just hang out in the school parking lot all day and not go 
[02:39:30]  to school and just listen to rock music.  Abba.  Go into the woods.  Zep.  Zep.  Zep.  Zep and Ab.  Zep over Sabbath.  No, no, no, no.  Just hang out and listen to the cars.  The cars.  The cars.  I like the cars.  Don't start a new character today.  I'm not.  Who's that, Small Mouth?  I cut too much.  His name actually, Little Mouth.  His name's Little Mouth?  I cut too much school and then I couldn't go back.  Like, I'd reach those points where it's like, wow, I haven't been to social studies in like 
[02:40:00]  three weeks.  What am I going to do?  Just pop in and go, oh, hi, I'm back.  So you couldn't go.  You'd reach a point where then you'd have to avoid the teachers in the hallway because  she would know that you hadn't been to class in three weeks and you can't just drop back  in.  So you'd cut out of that class and then I'd cut other classes or I'd cut the whole day  and just smoke pot at my friend Frank's house and watch like Gilligan's Island.  I remember when you'd come over and he's like smoking pot with you.  I've never smoked pot with you, you frowning idiot. 
[02:40:30]  You said your friend Frank's house.  Oh, Frank.  It was a different Frank.  I'm sorry, Frank.  Yeah, he wasn't Frank the frowner.  Good improv skills.  Frank the stoner.  Yeah, no kidding.  Great.  It was beautiful.  I didn't recognize his name.  And then you ruined it again.  You went, no, the other friend.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't think we were in a groundlings fucking meeting.  Guy's name is Jimmy, you idiot.  Time to pass out the pop.  Yeah, we're going to do freeze-its next.  Jerk off.  We're going to do hands. 
[02:41:00]  And go.  Let's get a paw.  All right.  It's a comb and you have a baby foot in your asshole.  Go.  Give me an occupation.  Occupation.  Em.  Em.  Em.  There's always one guy trying to yell something funny.  Ice cream eater.  Oh, you're not.  No.  All right.  Go ahead.  And you can always tell who is who.  Job.  Oh, great.  Frank again.  Plastic surgeons.  And a strange situation to be in. 
[02:41:30]  Uh.  You're shitting on the couch and your grandmother catches you, but she's sucking a negro's balls.  Go.  Hey, let's go to Paul New Rochelle.  He's got a question for Frank the Frowner.  Ooh.  Uh.  Frank the Frowner, I want to know if you have a rebuttal to Tippy Tom and his comments on the Kentucky Fried controversy.  I haven't heard those comments, so I'm not going to comment until I've heard everything. 
[02:42:00]  What were they?  I think he's...  He was talking about putting turkey in the chicken.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I like to do turkey impressions.  Your question's upsetting him.  He seems to be frowning.  Do you know it takes more muscles to gobble than it does to smile?  I once read on the internet.  What's your comment on immigration?  I don't have any comments on immigration.  This is not a wacky news bit, sir.  This is a childhood birth defect.  Yeah, man, the guy's going to wreck the new character. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, stop it.  Don't wreck the new character.  All right, back to the kid that didn't miss a day of school.  18-year-old Stephen Reneau is proud of his record, and he should be.  He didn't miss one day of school from first grade all the way through to his senior year in high school.  None of my friends have ever, you know, encouraged me to go to school with them.  A lot of my own poll, my friends.  Do you know how great it would be if on his way to pick up his graduation ceremony, he was mowed down by a drunk driver? 
[02:43:00]  Some kid playing hooky.  Just had a bottle of Jack and fucking wrecked his dreams with one misread life.  With Leonard Skinner blasting Freebird?  Oh.  All right.  Through to his senior year in high school.  None of my friends have ever, you know, encouraged me to cut school with them.  All of my friends are actually, you know, into their schoolwork also, so they haven't felt any need to encourage me to cut.  And I actually don't really know many of my friends who have cut school.  Now, keep in mind, Stephen never even stayed home sick. 
[02:43:30]  He says missing school just wasn't beneficial.  When you miss out of, when you miss the day of school, you end up missing a lot of stuff.  And it's more work to keep up with it than, you know, than just staying with, do it the whole week.  It's more hassle than what it's worth.  Exactly.  Now Stephen is graduating from Staten Island Technical High School.  And in the fall, get a load of this, he's going to be attending Yale University, and he's majoring in economics.  In college, I guess I plan on keeping my perfect attendance.  I'll see how it goes once I'm there.  I don't know yet. 
[02:44:00]  But I probably will.  And on the back of Stephen's t-shirt there, it said Yale 2010.  Well, that's going to be the year that he graduates from Yale.  And you know his mom.  Why else would he have that?  Her name is Marilyn.  She is very proud of him.  And of course, we wish him the very best.  Why else would he have the date on the back unless that was the class he was in, you fucking stupid idiot?  The burnout should have broke into his house after his parents leave for work and just like duct tape him to a chair so he misses a day of school.  Can't get to school.  I must make it.  He had a perfect attendance record, except for that one day where he was taped and raped by fellow students with a lacrosse stick. 
[02:44:30]  He sounds and he is, Jason.  Thank you.  Yes, which means he actually attended more school than six of his other family members combined.  Or he'll be shot on his first day of college.  The one big chance of getting out of the rut of the community.  Is he, is he, is he, is he, um... 
[02:45:00]  I don't know.  Do you think he is?  I don't know.  Yes.  What do you call a black guy that didn't miss one day of school?  A shwuggy?  No.  No, I don't know.  A very responsible young man.  A black guy with white parents?  That's right.  You went with the bit a little too much, Bob.  You know, I don't mean to tear down a wall here, but, you know.  I'm sorry, dude.  Dude, I'm going to tear down the 30th wall.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Sometimes we don't what?  I'm the only one that tears the wall.  Well, I'm not, this is not me speaking. 
[02:45:30]  You don't want me doing Frank the Frowner now, do you?  This is Jim Norton, the actor that plays.  No, that's my bit too, Jimmy.  Frank the Frowner.  That's my bit.  You can't do Frank the Frowner.  That's my bit when I step out of character.  Oh, Opie.  I can't.  Just do Frank the Frowner.  Why can't, don't, you said he can't do, why couldn't Opie do Frank the Frowner?  I, I, I...  Steal it.  No, I don't want to steal.  Yeah, you know who Frank the Frowner's cousin is?  Who?  He's Frank the Angry Frowner typing guy.  That's my bit too.  Stop.  Angry typing guys.  I've run out of bits to come up with.  I can't come up with any new ones. 
[02:46:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  Now you're, now you're combining your bit with my bit.  Stop.  Speaking of Frowner.  Hey.  That's my brother's bit that I ripped off.  Speaking of Frowner.  Hey.  I'm a black ninja.  Hey.  The Chinese are coming.  I haven't developed that one yet.  I'm still working on the Chinese are coming.  Give me time on that.  Let's say hi to Mike in Miami. 
[02:46:30]  What's up, fellas?  Yes, what's up, Mike?  Hey there, Mike.  What's going on?  What do you say, Bill?  Man, I'm much there, Steve.  Listen, Opie, how does it feel yesterday making a New York Times bestselling author crumble  with his stories and look like a complete dipshit?  That made me feel really good.  Yeah, that guy, to be quite honest with you.  Really.  That guy pissed me off on a level, like we say this all the time on the show, that I can't  even explain to you, because it's like, me and my friends, we all had stories like that. 
[02:47:00]  Bob, these guys that are in the studio all had those stories, and this guy is, you know,  just lying through his teeth.  And we were all laughing and enjoying it, and there was one part of the story.  Every one of us just shut off at the same time.  Yeah, we went.  Yep.  When he, when she puked too.  This guy's such a phony.  When he puked in her back.  Shut up.  It's like, the story was entertaining, and it could have happened, and then when everyone's  puking and shitting, and the cameraman falls out of the closet, and he's puking, it got 
[02:47:30]  to the point where it's like, stop it.  It got uncomfortable in here, because we're all looking around like, well, we gotta call  him out now.  Are you a fucking Mel Brooks movie?  We get it.  All I kept thinking was, shoot the hostage.  Because what was going on, we were going with it.  It was like, all right, the guy's telling some stories that a lot of people can relate  to.  This is kind of cool.  And then he went, he went so far over the top, like, all right, now we have to make  him look like a complete ass.  That's the thing.  We've all had these kind of stories.  Anybody who's going to college, anyone who's banged a chick before has had these issues. 
[02:48:00]  But this guy just went on and on and on, and kept discrediting himself.  And let me tell you, I'm down here in Miami, where he supposedly did the bulk of his  bullshit.  Yeah.  And, you know, I know a few guys who supposedly went to the gym, it's all hearsay.  But, you know, yeah, banging a chick is one thing, but people falling out of closets  with cameras and shitting, projectile shit.  And then not having the video camera or the videotape anymore?  I mean, come on.  And we knew we got to him, and we knew that, you know, we called it as it is, because he  started cursing E-Rock out at the elevator. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  You know.  What did he start to say?  He started getting mad at him?  Oh, yeah.  Going, fuck you, fuck them, blah, blah, blah.  So, all right, thanks, bro.  All right, fellas.  All right.  I guess we could take a break, right?  Mm-hmm.  I have to finish my delicious smoothie.  You guys really do.  You both of you are sipping on smoothies like two little girls at a park.  Ooh, they're good.  Are they good?  Yeah.  They're banana strawberry.  How could they not be delicious?  You're fat smashing.  Don't do it.  I can't.  Don't do it. 
[02:49:00]  This is not a bad thing.  What's wrong with...  I have...  Well, I have pineapple banana strawberry.  I have banana strawberry pineapple.  Who's that?  It's me.  That's just Jimmy.  That's just Jimmy.  My pineapple strawberry banana.  I like to have some...  I like three fruits.  You have two fruits.  I like three fruits.  I like a strawberry pineapple banana.  But you can't just have pineapple banana without strawberry.  What's in this that you can...  Pineapple strawberry banana.  I think it's frozen yogurt.  You can't have that in phase three.  No, actually, I think it's good.  It is good, actually.  Is it good? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, it's all right for you.  All right.  Dump report on the way.  A minister caught taping boys in bathrooms.  Oh, dear.  More of this crap.  The View...  Literally.  Star quits on Barbara Walters yesterday.  The audio is pretty good because it came out of nowhere.  Breathing, I hope.  Which she quit.  She said she will no longer grab Naomi Watts and try to climb a building with her.  And by the way...  By the way, we got to call out Barbara Walters today, too.  She's on the front page of the Post. 
[02:50:00]  After the show ended, then she just ripped Star Jones a new one.  Because she's a phony.  Why don't you do it right on your show?  She was right there.  You're a journalist.  She wishes her well and all that.  We got the audio.  And then the papers just went nuts because then Barbara Walters said she betrayed us.  She's this.  She's that.  Blah, blah.  I was trying to protect her and then, you know, tells everyone how she really felt.  Bunch of phoniness.  Bunch of phony baloney.  Pardon my French.  And then we got the...  Watch the mouth.  We got a lot of radio still to do.  We got the homeless cable access host. 
[02:50:30]  This thing is pretty interesting.  Oh, I saw that on the news.  Yeah, this is blown up as well.  So, you know, we'll eat carrots.  Or what is that?  What the fuck is that?  Wait a minute.  Stop making...  What is a...  I'm a vampire.  Who got those?  I did.  Carrots.  Why is there a bag of green giant carrots in the studio?  I love these things.  In the studio.  What else am I going to eat?  What am I going to eat?  What am I going to eat?  A whole plate of baccados?  I'm not hungry.  Have a plate of baccados. 
[02:51:00]  Oh.  Have some of my zikadoosh.  Hey, hey.  My mother, rest in peace.  She mixed these up a little sauce and a little wine.  Hey, that's my bit.  What?  That.  I'll tell you what.  Tomorrow, I'll bring in some leftovers.  I got a big half a pan in the fridge.  A big bag of baccados.  You know what to put up?  You have that?  Oh, fantastic.  To die for.  To die for.  My own.  You get the butter.  You let it simmer.  Just right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to put a little garlic caramelized on a pan and then you put it in your cacadoosh. 
[02:51:30]  Hey.  And then you put it in a little amount of...  Hey, this guy won't stop eating.  You got to get a blow up over there like a pack of...  Really?  You fat fucking dope.  Shut your fucking high school dropout mouth.  Shut up.  What the fuck?  What is he doing?  Oh, my God.  Look at these things.  They're delicate like little cuddles.  They're just melting in your hands.  Ah, the pork, the pork.  You put it in there, it'll melt in your mouth.  It melts in your mouth.  You know what else should melt in your mouth? 
[02:52:00]  A bullet.  Stupid.  Why are you eating carrots?  Who bought the bag of carrots?  I did.  These carrots have one.  Have one.  No.  Why?  Because you stuck my hand in it.  I will not have a carrot.  Why?  That's part of the reason.  Because two men have already put their big mitts in there.  I'll rephrase that.  Two men who itch their ass with their fingers.  And grab questionable women.  So let...  Hey.  Women that are questionably women.  Carrots are sweet.  It's a great little vegetable. 
[02:52:30]  It's a horrible little thing that is attempting to be sweet.  Children are told it's candy.  They're sweet to make them eat things.  No.  They're carrots and they stink.  Carrots are fantastic.  They're not.  These are a little low-fat ranch dressing.  Yeah.  A little dippy-ippy.  A little dippy.  Oh, see?  You got to put it in something that tastes good to make it taste good.  Next.  Hey, I care about looking good.  See?  After the break, we're going to discuss broccoli.  Boobs always bring this show to a hall.  Oh, screeching hall.  I don't plan.

[02:54:30]  It's the first time Bob is headlining.  You're not going to be disappointed.  He's great.  He really is.  Well, thank you, Opie.  You're welcome, Bob.  Want to do the dump report?  Yes.  The dump report.  The Daily Dump Report.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, The Daily Dump Report.  Here are your dumps from our FM radio show.  Well, you know, we're under FCC rules over there, so we've got to dump out of things that might be considered dirty. 
[02:55:00]  Might affect the children, Opie.  It's always about the children.  We must save the children.  It's the FCC regs, man.  The regs.  And likes to say regs.  I said it once.  He likes to say it.  And I'll never say it again.  Regs.  Rules and regs.  Rules and regs.  Regs.  Dude.  That whole ulations takes so much longer to say. 
[02:55:30]  I'm with you, man.  Yeah.  Let's say regs.  I follow you, cat.  I'm hep.  6.52.  It's the shitty radio station in West Palm Beach.  That was a caller.  Yeah.  Who started the ball a-rolling.  Yeah.  At 7.42 a.m.  Maybe fucking sneaking into somebody's crib at night.  Bob Kelly.  I said that?  You said that.  You definitely did.  Maybe fucking sneaking into somebody's crib at night.  You didn't know it, though. 
[02:56:00]  You didn't bat out.  What was the bad part?  Sneaking into the crib with the fucking-  Fucking.  We all looked at you.  You had no idea you cursed.  And we just went, ah, just like that.  We was all like, yo, man.  Let the motherfucking go because you didn't even know it.  We didn't even stop the show on that one.  At 7.52 a.m., found my underwear behind the couch with a turd in it.  They dumped turd?  We knew they would, too.  Why would they dump turd?  They dumped turd because of the context of what it's in.  It's too descriptive.  The turd being wrapped in underwear lets a little too much information about where the turd came from. 
[02:56:30]  So how would I say that?  How would you do that?  How would I say that again?  A log of shit.  I think turd, yeah.  A log of shit.  A log of shit came out of my-  Sometimes you just gotta just kinda let the listeners figure it out.  I believe you could call someone a turd.  You can say, you know-  Yeah, turd!  Don't be a turd.  So if I said-  You're a turd brain.  Okay.  Or I was fucking a kid, and I pulled it out my dick, and there was a turd on it. 
[02:57:00]  Okay.  Or how about this one?  Nah.  She wouldn't fuck me on the first date.  She fucked me on the turd.  This is so surreal, the fucking two different shows.  It's so weird.  It's like over there.  It's like, okay.  And then you come over here, and you're talking about sticking your dick in some cute ass.  Oh, Bob.  Anything.  Oh, don't slap me, silly.  7.55 a.m., pooey-poo coming out.  They said they dumped pooey-poo.  They dumped pooey-poo. 
[02:57:30]  That's too offensive.  Because God forbid a child hears pooey-poo, he might chuckle.  Can you imagine the FCC trying to action pooey-poo?  Pooey-poo.  Yeah, so they said pooey-poo, and you want to find them.  Fucking bunch of cunts.  And then 8, 11 a.m., Bob Saget got dumped out of by saying, pull your colon out and not  clean it.  Yeah.  So you can't talk about anything ass.  Right.  In certain contexts.  Right.  Yeah.  You really can't. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, almost.  Did it go in?  No.  No, it didn't.  It didn't go in.  I'm scared.  It didn't go in.  Scared.  Jordan and Kevin Bacon.  Oh!  Deny.  How does that feel good?  Such a macho douche I am.  I felt like I was Shaq.  You're sitting and batting a piece of paper, and it feels good.  It feels good.  It does feel good, though.  It does.  I'll play basketball with my nephews and nieces, and I have no problem showing them off.  I'm excited right now, because I can see it in your eyes that you're going to go again, 
[02:58:30]  and I'm going to fucking try to get it.  You know what I mean?  You got to really arc that thing.  Oh, shit.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah, you got to be a fucking flinching douche I am.  Oh!  All right.  Slap down.  I guess you're better.  I guess you're better.  It's a Hanes commercial.  All right.  Everyone's talking about Star Jones.  It's on the front page of the New York Post.  Star Wars is on the cover.  Star Wars.  I get it.  And Walters rips betrayal by Jones. 
[02:59:00]  The problem is, she ripped into Star Jones.  And, man, I hate Star Jones, but you know what?  Yeah.  At least she said it on the air.  Yeah.  Barbara Walters.  And she's not taking this.  She left the show.  She quit.  There's a behind-the-scenes, they're trying to work out a way, or were, trying to work out  some way where they can make it look amicable and make it look like they're, it's a mutual  parting of the ways.  And that's the way they always do these things.  You hear when somebody leaves the show, it's like, well, they're moving on to other things. 
[02:59:30]  They're looking to broaden their, but whatever.  It's always a bunch of bullshit.  And Star got on and just said, hey, I'm being fired.  That's pretty much it.  I'm being fired, and I'm done.  I'm leaving.  And now everybody's all pissed off at her for actually finally doing something that I can  respect her for, which is not going along with the same bullshit line.  No one ever gets fired in entertainment, by the way.  Have you ever heard? 
[03:00:00]  Who gets fired?  It's always people leaving.  We get fired, but it's barely entertainment.  Well, we joke about it.  Yeah, twice.  We joke all the time about XM, the emails that come out, that Blah Blah has decided to  explore new options or what have you.  No, he got fired.  People get fired.  They get replaced.  That's how it works.  But they always try to make it sound like it was some kind of a mutual thing.  And Star looks like a real cunt.  I think she's just a fucking entitled cunt on wheels.  Totally entitled. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, even before she dropped a ton, she thought she was like this pretty, wonderful diva.  Yeah.  Like, I'm a diva.  Oh.  Well, the deal is they're bringing in Rosie O'Donnell.  She must look like a bat with her clothes off.  And Rosie, by the way, I got a problem with her with this, too.  Well, Rosie O'Donnell's coming in, and they just feel like the chemistry would just...  What is the real situation, then?  They just feel the chemistry between Star and Jones.  Rosie's made some jokes about Star losing weight with the stomach stapling, and then 
[03:01:00]  talking about how she did it through diet and, you know, all this.  And, of course, Rosie can't drop weight, so she has resentment towards that, so she's  got to fucking speak up.  And I think she also handed that Star Jones' husband is gay.  Yeah, there was that little...  The nerve of the fucking Rosie, man.  She's blasted Jones for not admitting that she lost 150 pounds so quickly.  Gee, I don't know, Rosie, when you were on a show, what didn't you admit?  How the fuck can she put her... 
[03:01:30]  And I started to like Rosie, because she does shit on everybody.  How could you put yourself in that position?  A diet of hair trout.  Oh, that's disgusting.  But the fucking way you kept that under wraps, Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  Didn't say a word about that.  I'm going to sleep.  I'm tired.  Well, here's the deal.  You got to listen to this audio, because now Barb Walters is saying that Star Jones, you 
[03:02:00]  know, blindsided everybody to announce that she's leaving The View, even though everyone  behind the scenes already knew it.  They already knew.  They had it in the media.  Rosie O'Donnell's starting up in whatever, September, and they did not renew Star Jones'  contract.  So Star Jones, I'm sure it was just kind of, it was kind of just sitting there inside her,  and it was, you know, it was bubbling, and she finally said, you know what, I'm telling  everyone that I'm leaving the show, and it's not because I want to leave the show.  Yeah, I'm being fired.  Good.  So here's the audio from yesterday.  It surprised everybody, because it wasn't supposed to go down like this. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, hey, I'm so proud.  Do you mind, excuse me, one minute, you guys.  I apologize for interrupting you.  Something's been on my heart for a little bit, and after much prayer and counsel, I feel  like this is the right time to tell you that the show's moving in another direction for  its 10th season, and I will not be returning as co-host next year.  No blacks allowed.  I'm going to hold your hands right now, because as you might imagine, this might be the hard 
[03:03:00]  thing to do, okay?  Yeah.  It's been the most amazing nine years of my entire professional and personal life.  Barbara, I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime to sit at this  table and sit with you guys.  My co-host, Joy, and Elizabeth, and my Meredith in Ascentia, we have a lifetime of memories  together.  A lot of fun.  And I'm going to take all of that and the respect that I have for all of you with me. 
[03:03:30]  God damn rich cunts!  Oh, he had the charm in, didn't he?  God damn Jeff Goldblum.  His timing is always good.  Shane in Florida.  Shane.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  You guys walked all over Anthony's line, man.  Ooh, which one?  He said the Star Jones must look like a bat or all of her clothes off.  Oh, yeah.  Anyway.  There you go. 
[03:04:00]  Thank you, sir.  Is there any more audio?  I hope Jeff doesn't jump in again.  That was really rude.  That would be awful if Jeff Goldblum decided to voice his opinion.  A lot.  A lot.  Here's more Star Jones.  To the crew, Rob and Phyllis especially, and the staff here at The View, you all are  the most amazing, best in television.  And I've been honored to be your colleague.  And these viewers, you have welcomed me into your hearts and to your homes for nine years. 
[03:04:30]  And it has been a privilege that I cannot measure with words.  Wait for it.  I love you desperately.  Wait for it.  I thank you for the opportunity.  Wait for it.  I'm not sure what the future holds.  Wait.  Wait for it.  But I'm absolutely sure who holds the future.  And I thank you very much.  Goddamn rich cunts.  Goddamn rich cunts. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, I'm glad he doesn't actually interrupt her in mid-speech.  That would be really rude.  Yeah, that would be rude.  Well, so then Barbara Walters had a couple of quick things to say.  Oh, Barbara Walters.  Yes.  She's probably really well paid.  Hot topics.  No, that's a hot topic.  Not a hot topic.  That's the hottest talk.  Good thing.  And after nine years, now you want to talk about me.  Let's go to hot topics, you guys.  Seriously, no, really.  I really want to see you.  This is our show. 
[03:05:30]  And the thing that I've loved doing for nine years is coming here and doing this show.  I can't just say, oh, thanks a lot.  And let's move on and talk about it.  That's not exactly.  That's not exactly.  You know, and, you know, we've heard room.  This is a surprise.  This was that this would come about this way.  We didn't expect it.  But this I have to say.  From the day you came on this program.  Oh, God damn it. 
[03:06:00]  And the amazing view of being the success that it has been without you, without the kind  of work you've done, without your intelligence and your humor.  We have seen you evolve.  You are a great lady.  God damn it.  I am fucking, I am weeping, I'm laughing so hard.  Oh, that Jeff.  Oh, boy. 
[03:06:30]  They continue.  He has a one track mind.  He certainly does.  And whatever you decide to do, you know, you all have thought about it and talked about  it and that you feel it's the best for you.  I have no doubt that you're just going to be so, everybody would be very lucky to have  you and it is my, my joy that we have had you for nine years.  Thank you very much.  And my, my sadness that it's turned out this way, but it is best, whatever is best for you. 
[03:07:00]  You've been such a part of this show.  Thank you.  And it will, you know, it's, I can't imagine how the view would have succeeded without you.  So, thank you.  Go ahead, go on, leave, leave, I'll talk to you.  So, that's what happened on the show yesterday.  Shut up!  Goddamn rich cunt.  And then Barbara Walters couldn't wait to get on the phone after the, after the show to  really speak her mind.  She was blindsided. 
[03:07:30]  Good.  Instead of, yeah, she probably needed time to like get with people and just figure out  what to do instead of like just going with the raw emotion she was feeling.  Yeah, I'm being honest.  And now it's on the front page of the, the New York Post.  A furious Barbara Walters said yesterday she was blindsided.  And betrayed by Star Jones when the formerly corpulent commentator quit the view in the  middle of a live telecast and later said she'd been fired.  I love Star and I was trying to do everything I possibly could up until this morning when  I was betrayed to protect her.  Betrayed.  So, why don't you, that's, uh, Walters. 
[03:08:00]  Why are you betraying her?  Why are you protecting her?  Why, why won't you be honest?  Yeah, betrayed.  How about you fired her?  Why don't you have an honest moment and go, wow, this is not cool.  You know, exactly.  This is what I was trying to do and, all right, you want to get into it, let's get into it.  Star said she was afraid that we're going to make ashtrays out of her hands.  Oh my, where's that bell?  My God.  Uh, Jones didn't mention getting axed when she said goodbye on air, but soon afterwards  told People Magazine her contract had not been renewed for her 10th season on the Daily  Talk Show.  I feel like I was fired, she told the magazine, which posted her interview on the internet 
[03:08:30]  while she was still appearing live on The View.  Goddamn rich cunt!  Walters goes on to say, I would have loved for Star to have left and not said I was fired  and not make it look like the program was somehow being cruel to her.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  The funny part of that is, as you're reading, I just see Anthony's head tilt to the right  and look at the machine.  I know it's coming.  It couldn't mean anything else.  Of course. 
[03:09:00]  Uh, Walter said ABC Brass decided last fall not to renew Jones' contract.  We try to talk them out of it, and we try to give Star time to redeem herself in the  eyes of the audience, she said.  Uh, a show source said Jones made her surprise announcement so her fans would turn against  the show.  She took back some control and it doesn't look good for the show, the source said.  She does have fans and they won't like that she was forced out for Rosie O'Donnell, the  source said.  Goddamn rich cunt!  This is a brutal clip. 
[03:09:30]  It certainly is.  Oh, this is something we've talked about on the show.  I have this my sig pic on Whack Bag 2.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the whole video clip of, uh, Jeff Goldblum beating that woman and calling her a goddamn  rich cunt.  President jogging with ol' ice cream scooper feet.  He really does have weed-whacker feet.  Oh, God, no! 
[03:10:00]  That's a soldier!  Sickle foot.  That is a soldier.  I know, though.  He should jog through Amish country and help him with the weeds.  That is so...  Of course, it's awful.  Sorry, I didn't realize that was off limits after all the AIDS and baby rape jokes we did.  Sorry, invisible line in the sand.  Shit dicks.  John in Philly, what's up?  Hey, Rona?  Can't help it.  I turned his fucking TV on. 
[03:10:30]  I just see this fucking guy with eyeglass, nose bridge holders on his feet, running around  the fucking lawn with the most powerful guy on the planet.  It bothers me.  He's bouncing seven feet in the air every time he takes a stride.  Clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink.  We know.  We know.  I'm John in Philly.  Nice kids.  Hey, Rona.  It's just John from Philly.  Yeah, we're calling.  Just saying we love your show.  We love you guys.  I currently serve in the military.  Thank you, man.  And we get your show over in Iraq because we get burnt copies on CD.  Nice.  I always say we love what you guys are doing for us.  Thank you. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, thank you, man.  That's very cool.  Yeah, now, is there any way, because we don't get XM out there, we have to have our home  base, and we have to have parents and everybody send support packages with burnt copies  of your show.  Is there any way XM will be going overseas?  Dude, we've asked them so many times, but XM said no because they support the insurgents.  No, we don't know.  It's a hard thing to pull off.  XM actually does help them with something with the military, uses XM's satellite to do  something.  We did bring it up, though, with XM saying there's got to be a way we can broadcast to 
[03:11:30]  the troops or do some kind of cool thing for the troops, but it never really went anywhere,  unfortunately.  I think the military is actually going to stop that and not net XM.  Is there an address where people could send stuff?  Well, out there, well, your best friend, you would have to either go to your local USO,  which would be at an airport.  You could call any military facility, because there's multiple places.  Each base is sent to multiple areas in Iraq.  What's the general's, what's the general's, there's a big thing over there now with comics  going over there.  They won't let comics go because the general in charge is like this, you know, he's very, 
[03:12:00]  you know, against dirty humor and swearing and he's very God and like, that's why Colin,  Colin, they wouldn't let Colin go.  Me and Colin were supposed to go to Afghanistan and Iraq and they can't, he canceled it because  they said you can't swear.  Wow, no racial jokes.  No racial jokes.  You can't talk about anything.  Son of a bitch.  So they say you have to wait for this general to actually get rotated out.  Get him out.  And have the new guy in.  So the last guy was good.  You guys just want to laugh. 
[03:12:30]  They're over there fucking fighting for their lives and this cocksucker is imposing his  morals.  What an asshole.  This cocksucker general.  Some of the actual troops complained at one of the shows.  Well, fuck that too.  Some of the Christian, the Christian soldiers.  Of course.  Complained that the show was a little too dirty and they talked about.  Oh my God.  Well, when I was there, I served in Belide.  I did a little tour in Fallujah and Baghdad and we'd love your show out there.  We'd love it if somehow you guys could get out there or send some sort of.  Yeah, we're thinking of broadcasting from Fallujah. 
[03:13:00]  It'd be wonderful.  We're going to take a C-130 in and.  Yeah, that'd be great.  We could set up the mics.  Get shot at.  It'd probably be hard to do a show like that, gentlemen.  Might be a little distracting at that.  Well.  I just wanted to call to say we love what you're doing for us.  You guys are awesome.  You have the days and time goes by much faster.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, John.  We're going to send copies of this show and then the box should have McMillan and wife.  All right, you guys take care.  There's a little carrot juice on Jimmy's microphone. 
[03:13:30]  McMillan and wife.  These guys just want to freaking laugh.  The original title of that was actually Cop and Cunt.  Faggot and beard.  Who played McMillan?  That was.  Oh, wow.  What's it?  Where's the Iraq when you need him?  You wouldn't know.  Hold it.  It had the theme song.  Who was the big homo that came out?  Rock Hudson.  Steve-O.  Rock Hudson.  No, not yet. 
[03:14:00]  Rock Hudson was McMillan.  The shite.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Rock Hudson.  And Susan St. James was wife.  Susan St. James, right.  His name of that show was Empty Suit and Wife.  Light as a Feather and Wife.  I had no idea that it was him.  Pillow-biter and wife.  McMillan and T-cell.  Oh, McMillan and secret. 
[03:14:30]  Tina on Long Island.  McMillan.  Tina.  Broth again, McMillan?  Down at the station house with his thermos of broth.  You're out of uniform.  What's with that robe?  Did you see where McMillan carries his nightstick?  I don't know what that's going to say.  McMillan is wife.  Who's that dress belong to?  McMillan and wife. 
[03:15:00]  McMillan and widow.  Tina.  Yeah.  Oh, hi.  Hi, Tina.  Hi.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  How are you?  Good, Tina.  Let's go.  Okay.  I'm on Long Island. 
[03:15:30]  Oh.  I'm on 347.  A nice part of Long Island?  Or where are you from?  Of course, Jeff.  We're going towards Smithfield.  Good damn rich cunt.  Okay.  Tina.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You're on what road?  We're on Route 347.  347.  I'm heading towards Smithtown.  Okay.  And the rain stopped.  Yeah.  That's the highway.  I got about 50 wow stickers on me, so we're going to do a little sticker stop.  All good.  Ooh. 
[03:16:00]  Silver Camaro SS.  And, uh.  SS.  Camaro.  Come on, Camaro.  Wait, you're going to be wowing and giving out wow stickers today for us?  Yes, I am.  McMillan and widow.  Supporting the boys.  Bo, bo, bo, bo, bo, boy.  Do you, uh.  Who are you with?  Uh, with my boyfriend.  All right.  Ah.  You got nice, uh, juggies?  I got big jugs.  Yeah.  Huge jugs.  Long Island.  Long Island.  I rock Z. 
[03:16:30]  I'm big boy.  Long Island.  Tate's rule.  All right.  Where are you going to be stopping so people can check out your boobs?  Uh, by the mall.  Smith Haven Mall.  By the mall.  Smith Haven Mall.  There you go.  All right.  If anyone.  When are you going to be there?  Uh, 10 minutes.  All right.  If anyone sees this girl flashing, call up the show.  Are you going to be by the Nordstrom entrance or the Sears entrance?  Yeah, really.  When you get to the mall, give us a call back because we'll do a little wild thing in the  parking lot or something, all right?  What's the matter, Chief?  McMillan called again and he's asking to be partnered up with that Justin Volpe.  character. 
[03:17:00]  Let's go to Mike in Florida.  Mike, what's up?  Broth again, McMillan.  His captain.  Broth again?  I don't know how you do it on Broth every day.  It's all I can keep down, sir.  McMillan sneezed at a tooth on the desk.  McMillan wants to go to K-Line, but he has a poodle.  Tell McMillan not to go to the crime scenes until forensics leaves. 
[03:17:30]  He keeps leaving his own hair everywhere.  I shook McMillan's hand and his thumbnail came off.  Oh, keep that under your hat and wife.  Protected by the studio and wife. 
[03:18:00]  Let's go to Mike in Florida.  Mike.  Oh, shit.  Mikey.  Hey, Mike.  Mikey.  Mikey.  Oh, fucking A.  All right, well.  God.  You want to say never lose that Jeff Goldblum clip.  Bob Kelly, wake up.  Oh, is that funny, man.  Bob keeps falling asleep.

[03:20:30]  Thank you, Danny.  We're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  All right, let's say hi to Joe in Buffalo.  Joe, what's going on today?  Nothing, man.  I'm just checking out the Washington Times online,  and it says that you guys are one of the most listened to on a daily basis.  Hugh Pinero said that.  Whoa.  Yes, Hugh Pinero, the CEO of XM.  I got in front of me here.  Mr. Pinero would not tell us which programs draw the biggest audience on a daily basis,  but he did say that the Opie and Anthony show, along with XM's comedy and news channels, 
[03:21:00]  tend to be the most popular.  Hey.  Oh, one more thing, guys.  How's that for Phelan?  O&A now can be heard on WJFK and other blah.  All right, whatever.  Keep going.  Thank you, Hugh.  Hey, one more thing, guys.  Yes, sir.  I was driving through Cleveland the other day,  and they still got David Lee Roth billboards up.  What's up with that?  They're probably paid for for a rest amount of time.  They'll get around to taking them down.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Yeah, we're very popular because we have little riffs,  like we just did on that very popular show.  Red Ribbon and WJFK. 
[03:21:30]  McMillan's tracking down some more clues down at the rest stop.  Why is he always going down to the rest stop?  McMillan's taking none of the shit again.  McMillan's always peeking through that hole trying to find clues.  Broad awareness and wife.  And wife.  McMillan's got that Abraham Lincoln assassination all wrong. 
[03:22:00]  He was talking the other day about Buddy Booth.  No, I had to be talking about the assassination,  because another thing about a shot to the head.  Let's go to Matt in California, Matt.  Hey, guys, what's up?  I just wanted to say congrats, Bobby, on headlining,  Caroline's, and rock tourgasm. 
[03:22:30]  But I don't know, man, are you going to stop the gayism that Steve is doing  with these promos, with that kajagoogoo?  What do you think about that?  Kajago, well, I mean, you really, you can't.  Sky, sky.  Every comic that does a promo for this program gets the faggy music behind it.  It's the faggy background music.  That's the bit.  That's Steve's way to get back at everybody.  By the way, I just did one that does not have faggy background music.  I specifically demanded it.  I actually told him in the thing, I go, 
[03:23:00]  don't put stupid music behind me, like too shy.  And what does he do?  And he did it.  You just keep your mouth shut, you leave the promo,  and hopefully the comedians get faggy music.  I got country music.  Hopefully gay fingers doesn't make you look too bad.  Yeah, somebody's got to put a stop to that, man.  All right, thanks.  Love you guys.  All right.  It's better than the other.  I like the bit.  I like the bit, too.  Donna is, Yvonne, actually, is scared of balloons. 
[03:23:30]  What?  What?  Another phobia?  Yeah.  Is this from what show?  Where you want to do homeless cable access host who hates gays and blacks and...  That one.  That sounds good.  Homeless guy.  This man should have a home.  He's only talking to, like, maybe 30,000 cable subs.  Well, let's get him on the phone.  He'll be talking to a lot more people than that.  Well, CNN did the big story, those dopes.  Oh, they did?  Giving this guy a lot more exposure.  Gave him the attention.  Community access TV offers programs you're not going to find anywhere else. 
[03:24:00]  But in Burlington, Vermont, the freedom to make television has turned into a debate over the freedom of speech.  As one host does everything he can to push the public access boundaries.  CNN's Keith Oppenheim has our story.  In Burlington, Vermont, long after the sun goes down, a show begins on cable TV with something offensive for just about everyone.  The host of the show spews violence against women. 
[03:24:30]  He once showed a video of a pig's head being cut off as he attacked what he called feminazi pigs.  His name is John Long, viewed by many as a racist, someone who encourages violence against gays.  My goal is to be the most hated person in Burlington.  Wow.  I guess he's getting there.  We got to get him on.  John Long.  The public access gets crazy.  Please, let's get him on.  I don't get the rules. 
[03:25:00]  I just don't get the dumb rules the FCC have, the rules for TV and cable TV in particular.  Yeah.  It's just all fucked up, man.  It's just fucked up.  It's like rags, man.  Sorry, it just doesn't end.  Steve and wife.  I have to go solve this crime.  Catch you.  Steve and wife. 
[03:25:30]  Steve and wife.  Steve, you're done with that case?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  Steve, your evidence is all messed up.  Damn it.  The Steve clips have to be together.  What was that, sir?  Steve, what do you think of your casework?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  His acting stinks.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  That stinks. 
[03:26:00]  That was supposed to be like a grief moment.  Yeah.  Steve did a sketch and his acting is so bad.  But this was supposed to be like F3.  Here's about it.  Someone talks about the death of their own mother.  Yeah.  This is Steve's response.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I can picture his fat head shaking and his eyes kind of closed when he said it.  Why are you mad?  You're in my house.  You're in my fucking house.  You're in my fucking house.  Why are you mad?  You're in my fucking house.  Sing songy ass in life.  We should get it for Bob Kelly. 
[03:26:30]  We have to.  It's worth playing again.  Go get that piece of production.  And would refuse to direct him.  You're terrible.  Here's more audio of the homeless cable access host.  On TV, he goes by the name Mr. Happy.  In real life, he doesn't have a paying job or a roof over his head.  John Long is 44 and homeless.  How long have you been homeless?  About on and off for about like 25 years.  Back in 1995, when O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murder, Long says he was outraged and wanted 
[03:27:00]  to broadcast his opinions.  He went to Vermont Community Access Media.  Which sees the benefit of allowing people to express themselves no matter how reprehensible  their content would be.  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  Yeah.  They certainly are.  I'm so surprised they haven't figured out a way to put a stop to those cable access and  public access shows.  Because they really are.  Some of them I watch and I want to throw like something through the television.  You ever seen Damon X? 
[03:27:30]  Where do you find him?  Man, me and Billy Burr used to watch him all.  Probably the funniest guy.  He looks like Robert Downey Jr.  But he puts white makeup on and black around his eyes.  And he sits there and just, in like one episode, he's just like, I want to be motherfucking  motherfucking motherfucking president of the motherfucking United motherfucking states of  motherfucking America motherfuckers.  Now, if you vote for me motherfucking right motherfucking now, I am Damon motherfucking 
[03:28:00]  X motherfuckers for like an hour.  That's all he says is motherfuckers.  It's the funniest thing ever.  Can we get that?  How do we get cable access?  Damon X.  It's on Time Warner in Brooklyn.  I know they got some.  So maybe E-Rock.  I don't know if I have it here.  Oh, forget it.  Guys, Tina's ready to wow.  Uh-oh.  Tina.  Yeah.  Hi, Tina.  Hi.  You're down at the Smithhaven Mall, are you?  Yes, I'm at the Smithhaven Mall.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We have a... 
[03:28:30]  I'm at the Verizon store.  We have a Ted Van Driver headed down.  Yeah, how many...  Ted Van Driver.  How many people are around you right now?  Well, nobody yet.  I'm waiting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what we figured.  It's a silver Camaro.  You guys know I already told you.  Of course it is.  Yeah, we're in the parking lot by the Verizon Wireless.  Parking lot by the Verizon Wireless.  That was a double mint twin.  What do you look like?  I have big teased up hair.  I'm wearing a short skirt and an 80s top with shoulder pads. 
[03:29:00]  What?  I got a fucking yellow shirt on.  Yeah.  My hair's bronze.  Like brown, blonde, highlight, straight, whatever.  Can you see areolas, honey?  I'm the chick with the big tits in the car.  Are you...  Hey, hey, Tina, Tina, Tina.  Yeah.  Are you in...  Is that your boyfriend's car?  Yeah.  Is he Italian?  Yeah, what do you think?  Of course he's Italian.  You are running through the gamut of Long Island stereotype.  Tina, get in the fucking...  Tina, Tina, Tina. 
[03:29:30]  Get in the fucking car.  Tina, get in the fucking car.  Tina, Tina, get in the fucking car, Tina.  We're going to show your tits on the radio.  How many times have you heard that at a bar at night?  I'm not...  Tina, get in the fucking car.  I'm not going to get that new fucking pocketbook if you don't shut your fucking piehole.  Tina, your friend's a fucking stupid cunt.  That's what it is, Tina.  Your friend is a stupid fucking cunt, and I ain't driving up fucking home.  Get in the car, Tina.  Are you a good girl or are you a cunt? 
[03:30:00]  Hey, boys, we got to take care of some business here.  I'm going to drive to the bridge and dance.  How's my hair?  Wait, what's happening?  What's happening?  Tomorrow.  It's the only time I ever mean something is when I'm dancing at the disco or giving away  stickers at the mall.  Are you a good girl or are you a cunt?  Look, Tina, it's only about dancing, all right?  I just want to dance with you. 
[03:30:30]  I don't want to be with you or nothing, Tina.  What the hell is happening out there?  Two kinds of girls.  I don't know.  Good girls and cunts.  All right, all right, I'm bored with it already.  Maybe guys are showing up?  I don't know.  Double J's in the backseat fucking her.  Annette, cigarette?  Oh, my God.  Here, listen to this.  Yeah.  Bob on Long Island. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Hey, man.  She's a fan of this.  Bob's out there.  Yeah, I'm getting wowed right now.  Oh, how is it?  Hold on.  Yeah.  Well, let me give you a good one.  Oh, I'm getting a good wow right now.  Hello.  Hey, there you go.  What does she look like?  She's huge.  Bob, what does she look like?  Oh, my God.  Put it this way.  Speed limit's 15 miles an hour.  I'm doing 60 trying to get away from her. 
[03:31:30]  Holy crap.  Put Tina on the phone.  I just drove.  She ran away.  She wowed and ran.  Her boyfriend's getting mad right now because she's second-guessing this.  Like Ligazamu and Son of Sam calling her a fucking whore.  Getting a fucking call.  A gap between her teeth.  Hey, does the Camaro have T-pops?  Oh, here comes the...  Hold on.  What, what, what?  What's going on?  Security?  Mall security?  Suffolk's finest over here.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're walking and they're driving around towards her, so I'm leaving. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, good.  Please arrest Fatty.  Great.  Please arrest her.  Like a freaking woodchuck.  Two handcuffs.  You know what?  It's Officer McMillan.  Put those away.  They're disgusting.  I actually went out of my way to see that and I'm very disappointed.  You're very disappointed, Bob.  He went out of his way.  He's very disappointed.  How far out of your way?  That never happens.  What's going on? 
[03:32:30]  What can you say?  There's a couple of cars pulling up and she's running up to him, handing him wax.  Oh, I thought that was the new audio.  It's a sight.  I work nights and now I have to go home and go to sleep.  I can't even enjoy myself.  Good luck.  Good luck to you.  All right.  More of the homeless cable access hosts from CNN.  Advocates against him.  I want to challenge the liberal elite here. 
[03:33:00]  Cara DeLeonardis works for an advocacy group that monitors hate crimes in Burlington.  My fear is that his show can incite someone to actually carry out something that he suggests.  But so far, no one's been able to show Long has incited anyone to do anything.  And state officials say Long's speech is constitutionally protected as long as he doesn't target an individual or clearly identified group.  If you start curtailing Mr. Long from speaking, then the next person to be curtailed may be you or I. 
[03:33:30]  You're not the word curtailed.  Whatever.  I hate the word curtailed.  We need audio of the actual show.  This is boring.  Oh.  Boring.  I want to hear what he's all about.  Hey, let's say hi to Rio on Long Island.  Rio.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What's up, Rio?  All right.  She's got some sloppy fat around the waist, man.  They're definitely big, but they're big because she's fat.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, the boyfriend's got the muscle shirt on with the Camaro SS. 
[03:34:00]  You guys picked it right.  The guido with the chick and the whole Long Island stereotype, man.  She thinks she looks good.  He thinks she looks good.  Yeah.  All right.  That's not bad.  They're big, though.  She's very, you know, she's loving the attention.  Looks like she's starving for it, and she's enjoying it.  How many people are there?  I just left about five or six people were there, and there is a couple of cop cars floating 
[03:34:30]  around in the parking lot, so I was like, it's not worth getting in trouble for.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, you make it with some of these chicks.  They think you got to dance with them.  I spent a lot of time on my hair, and then you hit it.  You hit my hair.  You hit my cunt.  All right.  One last thing before I get out of here today.  Are you tired, man?  Oh, man.  I'm tuckered out.  I have acting, man.  I have fucking workshops today and tomorrow. 
[03:35:00]  What's an acting workshop?  It's a thing.  You got to go to an act.  It's a shop.  It's a shop of acting.  We got the last thing for today.  I mean, you're such a soft voice.  You're all such softies.  The minister caught taping boys in bathrooms.  Oh, to what?  Get MacMillan on that case.  I'll take the evidence home, Captain. 
[03:35:30]  Minister and wife.  I'll paw over it.  Minister and wife.  McMinister.  Another trip to the rectory.  MacMillan on that case.  That's fucking silly.  I don't know.  MacMillan jumped on us in this case.  Really dug in deep with both hands.  He literally knocked my coffee off my desk and grabbed the folder. 
[03:36:00]  This is a sickening crime we have to tell you about.  And that's all caught on camera.  And this involves a minister.  A New York man is accused of trying to lure young boys for sex  and even taping them in a bathroom.  Oh, dear.  What a good life's car for me here.  Let's wait.  Police say they found this sick video.  And they say it's loaded with damaging evidence.  Police believe he shot it with a small digital video camera  in a bathroom at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.  It shows boys and men using the urinals.  Searching his room, we confiscated four computers, 
[03:36:30]  several hard drives, hundreds of CDs, and VHS tapes.  Detectives say they caught up with Cano  after he tried to lure at least two boys in the Middletown area.  He allegedly handed those young men nude photos of himself  along with his phone number.  Detective Thomas Miller was then contacted.  And he utilized that information and telephone number  to make contact with Cano.  1-800-9.  He had contacted him and pretended to be a 15-year-old male. 
[03:37:00]  And after a short conversation, had agreed to meet with him  for the purpose of either engaging in sexual activity  or being photographed.  Uh-oh.  Wow.  Where is your mind when you're handing young boys  your phone number?  Your naked photo and your phone number.  There you go.  In the right place.  In the right place.  That's like just, you might as well just break into,  or go into a bank with a gun and wait for the cops to get there  if you want to go to jail so bad. 
[03:37:30]  That's, there's no way you're not getting caught.  Did you think it through there, minister?  Did you?  They never think it through.  That's just like at the end of the row where it's like,  look, I'm not getting any action.  I've got to try something different.  You just think he went out of his mind.  The old, the old, the old, the old looky looky,  the, you know, the eyebrow wink wasn't working.  That ain't working.  Trying to build up a relationship ain't working.  Yeah, the old looking over, like trying to catch a glimpse  of his penis while you're both peeing didn't work.  He's just got to break the camera out.  Hand him, here's my card. 
[03:38:00]  Here's my card.  He actually incorporated it.  Pedophiling.  LLC.  He bought a licky, licky child.  Lick little child in front of him.  Cano was arrested on Saturday.  At the time, he was carrying his minister identification  from Jehovah's Witness Church.  In addition to the videotape, police also found beer, condoms,  and nude pictures when they searched his car.  Subsequent to that search, all these other packets, 
[03:38:30]  individual packets, both in English and Spanish,  of the same materials I described earlier.  So, so far, Cano is the only one facing charges in New York,  but more charges could follow after police in Chicago  finish their own investigation there.  Another strange twist, McMillan.  All your evidence has disappeared.  There's DNA on this evidence that wasn't here when we gave it to him.  Why is his condom empty?  McMillan, that's not a smoothie. 
[03:39:00]  God damn.  What are you chewing?  Sucking on the end of it like space food.  Roast beef and pea dinner.  Hey, let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  What do you got?  I'm looking for the fat pig.  Where are they?  Oh, that's funny, man.  Say that again, Chris.  Where is that fat pig on Long Island?  Where's that fat pig on Long Island?  So he's probably arrested by now. 
[03:39:30]  Smithtown?  Smithtown Mall.  Thanks.  All right.  They're not arresting her.  They're trying to rescue her.  Listen, dude, I'm not kidding.  I have to shit.  If I don't, I can't wait.  Do you want to take a phone with you or a mic or something?  I don't have to, but I can't.  We'd like to hear it.  I enjoy listening to Jimmy in the bathroom taking a dump.  Oh, listen, and you'll realize why.  Give him a mic.  Give him one that makes sure it works. 
[03:40:00]  Hold it, Jimmy.  Just hold it a little longer.  Turn it on right away.  We'll just listen in on you guys.  Dan in Rhode Island.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I just wanted to wish Bobby K good luck at Caroline's.  Break a leg, dude.  Oh, Jesus.  Break a leg.  Good dick.  Thank you.  That's very exciting for Bob.  Yeah, I'm very excited.  I'm very excited.  You guys are all going to be away, too, right?  Yeah.  Sorry, I was...  What are you there, the whole weekend?  I bought her the whole weekend, yeah.  You know I would be there, Bob. 
[03:40:30]  I'd love for you to be there.  I'm not gone for the whole weekend, so I can make it.  Why don't you come down?  I will.  All right, good.  I'm getting away.  That'd be good.  You've never seen me perform.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  Way back.  Back in the fucking day.  God, it was like 68, 69.  68.  San Francisco.  That wasn't me.  Wait a minute.  Is that mic on?  Jimmy.  Here we go.  Jimmy.  Hello?  Jimmy.  Hi, Jim.  Am I on the radio?  Yes.  I'm walking to the restroom.  Hey, is Frank the frowner with you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why? 
[03:41:00]  I have to go to the bathroom.  I'm like, oh, don't wait.  Oh, there's the door.  I need, excuse me, son.  Could you get me the key?  There's a young boy in pose office.  He should have.  Do you know it takes more muscles to frown than a smile somebody once whispered to me?  He's telling everybody that little factoid.  Oh, no.  He's running out of air as he does it.  He's such a creep.  He really...  Thank you, sir.  Isn't he terrible?  Uncomfortable creep.  Man, hold the bathroom. 
[03:41:30]  Now let's listen to Jimmy.  This is so disgusting.  I'm not ready yet.  Oh, it's going to make me puke.  Clean the seat off.  Oh, he's got to do his little ritual.  Clean the seat off.  You don't clean your chest off, but you'll clean the seat off.  Yeah, no kidding.  There's hairs on it, too.  It's not without his inconsistencies.  There's hairs all over the seat.  Hold on.  Hair's on the seat.  Yeah, a little curly one.  I'm not kidding.  You can hear his little belt buckle jingle.  No, that's...  I'm just carrying toilet paper off. 
[03:42:00]  Hair is going to put it in the seat.  Can you take a dump as Frank the Frowner?  But don't do it during the dump.  I know.  Believe me, I promise.  I won't spurl it.  What does that mean?  Hold on.  Now you'll hear some urine.  Wait a minute.  I'm still getting dressed.  What was that?  If you've got your phone, I'll be so happy.  Hold on.  Fuck.  Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons.  A new Kiss coffee house is opening up. 
[03:42:30]  Coffee without a tube.  Wonderful.  Really?  Hold on one second.  Another way to milk this audience.  Hold on.  Oof.  He looks like my aunt.  He really does.  He really does.  Fucking mod.  They actually don't use coffee filters.  They just pack his chest hair into the bottom of the coffee pot.  It's filtered through his chest hair.  Jimmy?  No.  Oh. 
[03:43:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Is that what that was?  Yeah.  Keep listening.  There's more?  There might be.  I don't know.  Where's the guy next to me?  Hold on.  Oh.  It's next to him.  Oh.  Oh my.  Just listen and enjoy.  Oh. 
[03:43:30]  Oh.  It's crackling good.  It's like Rice Krispies.  That makes me want to throw up this.  The next to him keeps flushing.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh my.  We leave you this Sunday morning with the sounds of a men's room.  Here we go. 
[03:44:00]  Bob's.  Bob's leave to be gagging.  Bob's puking.  Oh.  Bob's puking.  Bob's on the studio.  Bob, I don't leave.  Holy shit.  Actually sounds like his act.  He puked into the garbage pail and now he's over another garbage pail outside the studio.  It's that crispy sound that gets him. 
[03:44:30]  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  A little more.  Wow.  He's taking a leak.  No.  It's a gross thing of a life.  It's something coming out of somebody's asshole.  That's usually the way it works.  I don't know why I find it so funny.  How can you listen?  When things disgust me so much, but this, for some reason, I find funny. 
[03:45:00]  Jesus.  What are you doing?  You're pissing like a bitch.  Oh, are you here?  Are you done shit?  No.  Phew.  Oh, boy.  That was a good one.  Are you done?  Tell him I'm done.  You're done?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's done.  It's the grossest thing I've ever heard in my life. 
[03:45:30]  All right.  He put the headphones back on right when you did that.  Tell him to put them on again.  All right.  It's done, Bob.  He's done.  He's already wiped.  So he's done.  Yes. 
[03:46:00]  He's puking.  He's puking.  If you're going to puke, puke in here.  You know the rules.  This is that funny.  You know the rules.  Puke in here.  It is so goddamn immature, but I can't stop laughing at that.  He ran out of the studio.  He's like, he's puking.  You are just full of everything.  Bob, what's wrong? 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  Jimmy, you're just about done?  I am, actually.  You're done?  I'm going to say yes.  Bob, come here.  He's done.  I'm not sure if I'm done yet, but I'm going to try.  He's really done.  He's just the last tinkle.  He did.  Don't fuck me on this, dude.  He did the last tinkle.  How are we going to fuck you on this?  How long can the guy possibly shit for us?  When you were out of the studio, we said, are you done?  Right.  And he said, I'm done. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  So you weren't even in here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's fucking nasty.  Yes.  What the fuck is that?  That was the dog just barked.  What the fuck was that?  What was that?  What is he doing?  Fuck.  Is he strangling himself?  Jimmy, what are you doing?  I'm just pushing.  Autoerotic asphyxiation.  I'm making what they call a Macmillan sandwich. 
[03:47:30]  Don't strain.  That's fucking dirty sinuses.  Dave C.  From New York City.  MacGreavy and wife.  Anything, Jim?  I'm not sure.  Okay.  I think so.  Yeah.  Uh-oh. 
[03:48:00]  Mm-hmm.  I'll let you know.  Okay.  I don't want to interrupt.  What was that?  Fuck.  I think I'm done.  Good.  All right?  Yeah, I'm done, I think.  You're done?  I think so.  Are you sure?  There's something still in there.  I'm trying to manipulate it.  All right.  Are you sure you're done?  I'm using digital manipulation.  They call that the Macmillan technique. 
[03:48:30]  That's right.  Where you put hands on another man's hips and help manipulate his constipation.  Where's Frank the Frowner?  There's people in the stall.  They have to talk quietly.  Is there really a sound in the stall next?  Yes, there is.  Frank, you're going to have to whisper, okay?  I have to whisper, so I won't be overheard.  Frank the Frowner, everyone, in the stall.  You know, it's very hard to whisper for me.  They tend to talk loud.  Because of your frowning face?  I can't help, but the sounds come out differently than they're supposed to. 
[03:49:00]  It makes whispering very difficult for you.  I have a permanent frown.  You know, it actually takes more muscles to frown than this is what I once received in a communique.  Monster Cloud is saying, Jim's like a fucking bird.  His piss and his shit all come out at once.  Can we go home now?  Does he have headphones on? 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, he can hear us.  Hi, Bob.  Anything you want to say to Bob?  Hey, I can hear everything.  Hey, what's up, Jim?  How you feeling?  Good, man.  Are you trying to use Tai Chi to get that shit out of your ass?  Do it, do it, do it.  This is the problem.  What?  Oh!  Bob's up again.  You know the rules.  Puking here.  Puking here. 
[03:50:00]  No, I'm not puking.  You sure you're not going to puke?  You just heard a liquid dump come out of Jimmy's ass.  Are the headphones on?  No.  Give me a yes when they are.  Bob.  He's just flushed.  He's just flushed.  He's actually coming in.  God, what a fucking...  Yes.  Bob, where are you going? 
[03:50:30]  You've got to promote Caroline's this weekend.  Bob.  We're out of here.  Give the big plug.  Yeah, Bob.  Bob, the big plug of Caroline's.  I got one second, dude.  I don't want to puke.  Puke.  Ugh.  You know it was just liquidy.  There you go.  See, we all heard the flush.  There it is now.  There it is.  Flush.  A lot of people want to know why Anthony's not answering Jim's ass.  Yes, I do understand it.  Yeah. 
[03:51:00]  All right, why don't you give the big plug?  Yeah.  Caroline's.  Thursday, Friday, two shows.  Saturday, two shows.  And Sunday.  What time do you show Friday, stupid?  Eight o'clock, I believe, on Friday.  Did you say Friday?  No, no, no.  Who is...  Ugh.  Ugh.  I'm plugging while he's shitting?  It's the same thing.  Ugh.  Same value for your buck.  How do you fucking... 
[03:51:30]  How do you plug while somebody's shitting?  Believe me.  That's the same thing my asshole is saying about your plugs.  Ugh.  It's Saturday and Caroline.  Friday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Caroline.  Jimmy.  Me and...  How the hell...  What the hell is stuck in you?  You really had to go.  What is stuck in you, Jimmy?  Ugh.  Oh, here you go.  Oh, you're pissing like my grandmother.  Ugh.  A little...  A little clit. 
[03:52:00]  A little clit.  Sounds like a little...  Ugh.  All right, he's done.  You done, Jimmy?  Jimmy.  Jim.  I think so, yeah.  Fuck.  I'm strained.  He's got a pop of blood vessel.  He's got a bushel full of grapes coming out of his ass right now.  One at a time.  Bloop, bloop, bloop.  You ever have a bloop, bloop?  You ever have a bloop, bloop shit?  Comes out like a rabbit.  Oh, I hate that.  We just drop a box of milk duds from about three feet up. 
[03:52:30]  Bloop, bloop.  You know, clang.  Bloop, click, click, click.  Bloop.  I got the roids pushing out the back of my asshole.  It looks like your hand after steam hits it the next day.  Nice little steam blisters.  All right, Jimmy, you gotta be dumb, because we gotta go home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Are you killing something?  Creaky door.  He's leaving the bathroom.  Oh, is that what that is?  Oh, no.  What?  What?  What happened?  Please shit your pants. 
[03:53:00]  Where are you?  In the bathroom.  Oh.  Did someone just leave?  They came in.  Oh, they came in.  Get the washing in their hands.  The washing.  Dude, ask them for toilet paper.  Tell them you have no toilet paper.  All right.  Excuse me.  Can I trouble you for some toilet paper?  Hello?  Hello?  May I trouble you for some toilet paper?  I've run out of paper.  Or paper towels, anything.  Yeah. 
[03:53:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Is he getting them?  I don't know.  Is he there?  Yeah.  What is he doing?  I don't know. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, he's using the bathroom.  Hold on.  Oh, he's urinating?  I think so.  If he hands you a card and he's naked with his phone number on it, right when he hands you,  you've got to work up.  He's getting me sick.  I'm getting ready.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm trying.  Okay.  Okay.  He just put it there real quick and left. 
[03:54:30]  He just put the roll in here.  I was trying to time it out so I could talk to him and shit while he was handing it to me.  But he just, I just saw like a blank hand come up.  It was like fucking, he handed me that before Nicholson buried the axe in his chest.  Holy shit.  I just heard a here.  Yeah, here.  No one wants to be spoken to by a guy in a stall.  That was a big brother, man.  That was a big brother?  Oh, wait.  What's that? 
[03:55:00]  What's that, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Ask them for toilet paper and do it the same thing.  I don't know if it's the same thing.  Who cares?  Tell him you didn't get enough.  Someone just walked in and walked out.  Uh-oh.  My shit smell.  What happened, Mark?  What did Mark say?  I don't know.  It was a big, uh, a big brother.  Yeah, he was a big guy.  Big guy.  Well, whatever. 
[03:55:30]  I didn't ask him.  I didn't ask him for toilet paper.  What's that, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I asked Mars.  Mars, who is that?  It's me.  Mars, it's me.  It's me.  Who's me?  Jimmy, you're alone.  Huh?  You're alone in the bathroom.  Who's that?  Mars.  Oh, hi, Mars.  Oh, no one in there?  No. 
[03:56:00]  Damn it.  Help.  God damn, was that funny.  All right.  All right.  Sorry, that was kind of gross, but I had to get the, uh, the paper.  Bobby.  Yeah.  So, it's a sick pit, right?  Dude, that's...  Please don't do it again.  No, I'm actually finished.  No, dude.  Yeah, it's disgusting, dude.  It shot out of your ass.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Come on, man. 
[03:56:30]  Bob, where you going?  There's no puking in radio.  Bob, puking here.  You know the rules.  Bob!  He's gagging.  Bob!  And then, like, some bile comes up.  He gets, like, a little bit of bile that comes out.  Oh, fuck me.  Bob!  He really gets grossed out by that.  He's leaving.  Bob!  Oh, I fucking hate this.  Bob.  It's fucking disgusting, man. 
[03:57:00]  Get away from me.  Get away from me, both of you.  Bob.  What?  What?  What's wrong?  This fucking ass just exploded in my ear.  Oh, that's disgusting.  This sounds like a pack of firecrackers.  What all of them?  In the mud.  I'm wet.  I can't get it.  In the mud.  Bob!  Bob.  Bob's working on...  Wow, he really is puking.  He's puking in there, yeah. 
[03:57:30]  I think the pal talkers almost saw him puking.  Look out, because soon the guy with the camera is going to start puking, and then he's going  to fall on the tape, and we're going to lose all of this gold.  Yeah, and then he's not going to have a New York Times bestseller.  Right.  Bob, what happened?  Knowing it was just really just wet?  Wet and shitty and liquidy.  It's that crackling.  It's the crackling sound of the shit actually coming out of his asshole.  Yeah, I guess apparently I have a weak stomach for listening to someone's shit. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, God.  This is the longest session.  Jimmy?  Is that shit coming out of his ass?  Yes.  All right, they're running down the hall.  He's pissing out of his ass.  Is that coming out of his dick or his ass?  They're following him down the hall with a camera and a microphone.  Bob, what?  Come on.  Give your plug.  Give your plug.  In studio.  I'm going to be at Caroline's this weekend. 
[03:58:30]  Look at him over there.  I'm going to be at Caroline's this weekend.  You can't see him.  Thursdays and Fridays.  All right.  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Is he done?  Yeah.  He's got to be done by now.  He's got to be.  His little body can't hold this much waste.  You know what it was?  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Caroline's New York City.  Headline it all weekend.  Come down to the shows.  Put Bob on the...  Bob?  I'm right here.  Bobby.  What?  It was just because, honestly, I have a smoothie and bananas. 
[03:59:00]  And when I do that, it empties out everything that's been in there.  And I had a lot of meat yesterday.  Yeah.  And that's why it just sounds like a pack of firecrackers going off in mud.  It's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard, dude.  Why would you shit like that?  Why can't you just shit like a regular human being?  I do.  Listen.  Don't shit again.  You know, is he done shit?  He's got to be done.  Yeah.  He's just messing with you, Bobby.  Relax.  I'm at the...  Should I plug it again?  Is that his ass or his dick?  What is that? 
[03:59:30]  Is that coming out of his asshole?  My ass.  Is that coming out of your ass?  Yeah.  He said it.  My ass.  My ass.  All sexy.  Oh, what is that?  What is that?  Is he a fucking...  What is he?  Oh.  You should see.  Oh, my God.  It looks like a murder.  I think I shit on my shirt.  This is fine.  You know what?  I don't even give a fuck if they come.  I'm not plugging.  This is nasty. 
[04:00:00]  This is the grossest thing I've ever freaking heard in my life.  You guys stick around for the wipe.  What wipe?  What's the wipe?  What is the wipe?  It's not a problem.  Listen.  It's all calm down.  What is that?  It's wiping.  Is that metal?  Is that metal?  That was me wiping.  Do you have metal in your ass?  No, it's the toilet paper.  Listen.  No, the paper roll. 
[04:00:30]  Here it goes.  Is that a chicken?  Oh.  Ooh.  You all right, Jimmy?  Oh, boy.  Did someone just walk in?  Mm-hmm.  Somebody's here.  Someone turn the lights off.  The lights are off, Jimmy?  Sure. 
[04:01:00]  What does Frank the Frowner think of that?  He doesn't like the dark.  He has a sour stomach.  He has a sour stomach.  My favorite food is Smarties.  All right.  Are you done?  Done?  Ah, he's done.  See?  He's done.  Hold on.  I can't hear a word you're saying.  I can't hear you because...  Why?  Whoever turned off the light, I just kicked my headphones off. 
[04:01:30]  Hi.  And they went into the toilet.  Whoever turned off the light.  Ah, that makes me happy.  We have to get new headphones.  I just ran in and turned the light off in the bathroom.  You just dropped the headphones.  You know that liquid douche who just came out of your ass?  It sounded like a baby's head just popped out of his ass.  Hold on.  Don't go anywhere.  Okay.  We're waiting.  Here you go.  There's a bathroom door. 
[04:02:00]  Fucking inner sanctum.  I can't hear a word you're saying.  I don't know if you can hear me.  We hear you.  You dropped that.  Jimmy!  I put my pants on.  Wait, your mic, I swear, just went out.  Okay.  I put my pants on, and I was pulling them up, and this is the bottom piece on the floor,  and this fell off my fucking ear and went into the toilet. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, so the ear piece went into the toilet.  There's no shit on it, but that looks like a piece of toilet paper.  Oh, God, what is that on it?  There's something on it.  Is that shit?  No, no, no shit.  What is that?  What is that?  Yes, it's a piece of, like, bean skin.  What is that?  What are you?  Nuts?  Dude, don't fuck around, man.  Put it down, dude.  It's toilet paper.  Put it down.  Back away.  It's only a piece of toilet paper.  Back away.  Dude, it's out of the fucking toilet bowl.  Yeah, I know.  That you just shit in.  It's in the earpiece, too.  Oh, God.  This is now the guest headset. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, you.  No, I'm not using this one again.  You have to.  It's your shit.  Yeah, is it?  Have you heard of shit ear?  I haven't.  Oh, just step on it.  Don't step on it.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Don't step on it.  Don't step on it.  Make sure they're never used again.  Snashed headphones.  All right, we're going to go home now.  That's unsanitary.  You know, I once read an article.  What happens if a piece of a human ear  that causes death in 30 different countries? 
[04:03:30]  All right.  All right.  Oh, shit.  I'd say we had a fun, fun day.  Oh, my God.  God damn.  Boy, you have a lot in you.  Oh, that was a good one, too.  That was a good one.  Bob Kelly, Caroline's all weekend long.  212-757-4100.  Thank you, Bob Kelly.  We'll see you Friday.  You're going to come back in, right?  Yeah, I'd love to, Max.  All right.  And Jimmy, thanks.  And can we leave with some Frank the Frowner?  Frank, you get the final word today. 
[04:04:00]  I just want to smile.  Just once.  That's sad.  We might get a collection so you can get that.  I'd like to just one time go to Disney World  and smile like the other boys and girls.  Every time I would go there,  all of the Mickey and the Goofy would go,  why are you so sad, little boy?  And I would go, I'm not.  But my face doesn't know how to react to anything but sadness. 
[04:04:30]  And then Goofy said to me,  do you know what it takes for?  And I said, I know, I know.  I've heard that before.  Wow.  Across America.  True tales from the road.  Real evil.  Real stories.  Real boo.  I just got wowed on 75 Southbound at Knoxville, Tennessee.  And I just wanted to say thank you to that pretty young thing from Ohio  for flashing them boobies at me. 
[04:05:00]  They sure were nice.  Wowed me, you motherfuckers.  Wowed me.  Driving my truck down I-57.  A lady and her kid on an overpass.  I blew my horn.  She took the shirt up.  Wowed me with some big old boobies.  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony Wow line.  866-WOW-ME-05.  And if you need a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  Very proud of my big tip. </pre>
