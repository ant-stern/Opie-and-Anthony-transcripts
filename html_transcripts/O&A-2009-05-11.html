<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion featuring Jim Norton, focusing on the hosts' and Jim's experiences living in New York City high-rises.  They detailed their generally unfriendly interactions with neighbors, recounting specific instances of apathy and near-altercations.  One host described almost assaulting someone who blocked his path, while another shared tales of eccentric neighbors, including a karaoke enthusiast and a particularly unpleasant individual who initially mistook him for building staff.  The conversation touched upon a New Year's Eve karaoke party, a 12-hour live broadcast one host did from his apartment (involving excessive drinking, Michio Kaku discussions, and virtual interactions with Rihanna images), the legal risks of filming Craigslist escorts, a movie plot involving a Robert Frost poem and assassination, their hatred of free verse poetry, a childhood incident involving a friend's inappropriate behavior towards a host's sister, the movie *17 Again*, their improving SiriusXM ratings, the challenges of maintaining personal communication with the demands of morning radio, and their vastly different lifestyles and sleep schedules.  A short "Backstage with ONA" segment highlighted a joke bombed by staff member Danny.

The show then shifted to a review of the weekend's box office results.  *Obsessed*, *Ghosts of Girlfriends Past*, and *Wolverine* were heavily critiqued, along with a detailed, sexually explicit discussion of a breastfeeding scene in *The Hand That Rocks the Cradle*, speculating on the authenticity of Rebecca De Mornay's breasts.  Callers Kent (discussing a compromise with his girlfriend to see *Obsessed*) and Fontaine (commenting on racial representation in Hollywood) contributed to the conversation, which also included extensive, often vulgar, commentary on *Star Trek*'s success compared to *Star Wars*, a critical analysis of *Wolverine*'s plot, and a lengthy discussion of Wanda Sykes's performance at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.  Guest Keith Robinson, who attended the dinner with Sykes, provided firsthand accounts, describing the atmosphere, encounters with celebrities (including Samuel L. Jackson and Tom Cruise), and his meeting with the Obamas.  The hosts and Keith dissected Sykes's jokes targeting Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, and others, detailing audience reactions.  The segment concluded with further box office talk, criticism of the Yankees' performance, and a quick jab at Baba Booey's disastrous first pitch at a Mets game.

Further analysis of Wanda Sykes's White House Correspondents' Dinner performance dominated the next segment.  The hosts praised Sykes's boldness while disagreeing with some of her views, discussing her unexpectedly harsh jokes targeting Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.  Numerous listener calls offered feedback.  The hosts then extensively critiqued President Obama's performance, analyzing his jokes about Michelle Obama, his daughters, and Joe Biden, focusing on his perceived lack of comedic timing.  Eddie Money then joined the show in-studio.

The Eddie Money segment spanned several topics, starting with childhood anecdotes including his first marijuana experience and a humorous story about getting high with his future wife.  The conversation covered his daughter's musical talent and rebellious behavior, his family life, past drug use, his current relationship with his wife, songs covered by other artists (including Hinder and Foo Fighters), controversial stage antics, his music's inclusion in Grand Theft Auto, and a scathing review of a "Take Me Home Tonight" cover by David and Kenny.  They also discussed "Rotgut," the "Naked Cowboy," his legal troubles (involving his daughter's marijuana possession), his experiences with other musical acts, and his theatrical production, "Two Tickets to Paradise."  Listener Derek, a self-proclaimed fan, even sang a song with Money.  The segment concluded with further anecdotes about Money's past, his various songs, website, and upcoming performances, punctuated by vulgar and offensive jokes.

The final segment focused on a rock band's "gay" cover of George Michael's "Careless Whisper," contrasted with the original.  Black Eyed Peas' "Boom Boom Pow" also received similar ridicule.  A significant portion was dedicated to graphic descriptions and sexually explicit jokes about a Break.com video of a topless woman playing with ice cubes. The hosts attempted to identify the background music.  Finally, they briefly discussed a baseball game's home run call and a Polish pop star's music video before concluding the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Weep, weep, weep, weep.  I just fucked it off in the hallways. I didn't know we were starting.  Yeah, and all of a sudden, bam!  Holy crap, I missed time that day.  It's showtime!  We had a little chit-chat with Jim Norton in the hall.  I think we had a little water cooler talk.  Did you have a water cooler talk?  Was it fun? 
[00:00:30]  Well, I was going to the bathroom. He was coming out of it, which, of course, sucks.  Was he wiping his mouth?  I'm right here, Ed.  We kind of like being in the bathroom at the same time.  And he goes, hey, I was just thinking about you.  And I go, why?  I was cocking his hand.  Like, thanks.  I was. As I walked out, I was like, hope goes away all the way.  I don't know why I was thinking that.  Your mind just rambles a little bit.  It's not that I go away.  I don't like living in New York City. 
[00:01:00]  But you live here.  It's very convenient for what we do.  And I make the best of it, but I hate living in New York City.  It's a fact.  I mean, people...  During the week, it's the grind of working and everything like that.  But the weekends, you want to get the fuck out of New York.  New York City is not a fun place to be on the weekends.  No.  And, yeah, it's one of these...  Well, I think most cities are like this.  Everyone wants to get out and go do stuff.  Yeah, because other people are coming in.  Right.  Suburbia is coming in to party at some of the places. 
[00:01:30]  And you're just like, get me the fuck out of here.  No.  And I live in a building.  I live way up in the sky.  I've been there two years.  Sounds magic.  I know.  It does, right?  It sounds magical.  Magical.  You live in the clouds, man.  You live in a cloud city.  And I've been there two years.  I don't know a soul.  I nod to people.  I try to, like, start conversations.  Just a little bit.  Because you don't know.  You might have something in common with somebody.  Hey, it's going to be 68 today.  What do you think?  Right.  Well, I mean, you have what?  Hit down, please.  Hit lobby and shut up. 
[00:02:00]  You have what?  Like two neighbors, three neighbors in your, you know...  In my general diameter of my little direct neighbors?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I have at least 200 apartments to choose from.  Yeah.  So you would think if you met somebody that was cool, you know, you'd start a little relationship.  And it's like, hey, 24th floor tonight.  We're going to watch the game.  Or whatever.  I'll be there.  Right.  But you can't get anything going with any of these people.  They suck. 
[00:02:30]  They just suck.  And then you walk around the neighborhood.  And they're just a bunch of snobs with their tiny little dogs.  Right, Jimmy?  Jimmy lives in the same neighborhood.  Is downtown different, Jim?  You lived down there.  Downtown is way different.  Yeah, it is different.  I lived on a 43rd.  I never lived downtown, per se.  But, yeah, I think it is a bit different, man.  Yeah.  Very different.  People are a little more social.  Yeah.  As far as shit like that goes.  I forgot to tell you.  I almost beat the crap out of a father as he was walking his two little kids on the Upper  West Side.  I forgot to tell the story.  Was he the warden of a Turkish prison? 
[00:03:00]  Little fat kids.  I love that.  This guy was a complete douche.  Just a douchebag.  Like, walking the streets of New York.  Like, thinking his shit don't stink.  And I was, like, minding my own business.  And it got to a point, like, the guy was a complete asshole.  Right?  And so we have a confrontation.  And his...  Wait, wait.  He's in front of you or behind?  We're walking.  Okay.  He wouldn't move out of the way on a sidewalk where I'm pretty much stepping in dog shit  and puddles and...  And it walks you off into the gutter? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  One of these assholes that's like, you know, I'm the most important person on the sidewalk.  There's a little more to it, but...  You get sidewalk rage.  Well, oh, huh?  He starts making beep noises and cutting people off.  It's a normal thing, though, Aaron, if you live in the city.  It's this weird thing with the sidewalks.  Like, people are fighting for their space.  Just move out of the way.  Who gets this shit?  We'll all get to where we want to be.  So the guy, we have a little confrontation, and he yells to me, 
[00:04:00]  oh, why don't you just go back to Jersey?  I'm like, what are you talking about?  First of all, I'm not from Jersey.  But that was his thing.  Go back to Jersey.  Like, he thought I...  Because how I was acting on the sidewalk, that I must not be from the Upper West Side.  The very important Upper West Side.  Ew.  Yeah.  That's what I said.  I went, ew.  And then I made a split-second decision not to, like, cause a major scene.  Not to just belt him in the face.  And beat him up in front of his tiny little kids. 
[00:04:30]  That's embarrassing.  They never forget that, by the way.  Huh.  You would have changed the life.  You would have made a fork.  Of the two kids?  You would have made a fork in their life right there, where they could be who they are and  who they're going to be.  Yeah.  But you would have turned them into something else right at that moment because they'd never  forget someone punching their dad in the face.  And let me tell you, this guy, just think of the biggest douche you've ever come across.  This guy was right up there.  Right up there.  I guess he was born and bred on the Upper West Side and maybe his parents came from the Upper 
[00:05:00]  West Side.  Yeah.  You're nouveau riche.  I love the people that, like, they try to, like, try to keep the city how it is.  This city is a place where you shit on it for as long as you can, make as much money as  you can, and get the fuck out.  And then you leave.  But the people that are born and bred don't understand that.  You know, when they see, like, an old building getting knocked down so they can build a nice  modern building, they're out there with their signs and their bullhorns.  This is a landmark.  They fight for every landmark. 
[00:05:30]  And if you drive around this place, it's a place to make as much money as possible.  That's what New York City is.  And then you hopefully leave with some good cash.  Because it costs you an arm and a leg to live here.  So once you make the money, you get the fuck out.  Yeah.  Either you go back to the country you came from or whatever.  You move to a nice suburb.  A place where you could get a castle for relatively low money.  Yeah.  But these guys are out there and they think New York is a special place that we should protect  and all that.  No. 
[00:06:00]  No.  We lost that a long time ago when we told the Dutch to beat it.  This is our place now.  Beat it, scram, Dutchman.  New Amsterdam.  You know, I don't know anybody in my building except for my direct neighbor.  She's like a finance banker.  She's an Asian woman.  I see her like maybe once every two...  Would she jerk you off every so often?  Does she at least say hi to you?  Oh, she's very...  She knows me.  We actually talk in the elevator.  Yeah.  You know, she travels a lot.  Yeah.  And her boyfriend's a dude. 
[00:06:30]  Mitchu Kaku.  Yes.  Oh, the cookie man for you.  Dummy.  Dummy, hey, Pinocchio.  No, her boyfriend is a guy who looks like an MMA fighter, actually.  I've seen him in the gym.  He's actually broken the heavy bag, kicking it.  Oh, that's the guy?  Yeah, he's a savage.  You've talked about him.  Wow.  But they're really nice people, but that's the only people...  I'm taking the elevator up, and we both get off on the same floor, like a person, and  they'll walk right, and I'll walk left, and I'll go, I don't even realize this person  lives on my floor.  Yeah.  Like you don't...  Like sometimes I'm walking behind someone on my floor, and they're like in... 
[00:07:00]  I'm in apartment E, and they're in apartment G, and I'm like, I've never seen them before.  Yeah.  I've never seen you before.  My neighbor...  That's so weird, man.  I got three on my floor.  The one guy who's the closest to my apartment is the biggest douchebag.  He's even...  He could be even worse with the guy with the kids.  Like he sees me, I try to like, hey, like, hey, like we live on the same floor.  It's kind of like this is...  At least give the hey nod.  Something.  He's like, he's a grump, and he goes into his apartment, and I've tried... 
[00:07:30]  Show people.  Right.  I've tried to say the hey to him a few times, whatever.  One night, I'm dragging my garbage to the garbage chute, and he's going into his apartment.  He goes to me, can I help you?  I'm like, are you fu...  And now another conversation.  I go, are you fucking kidding me?  I'm your fucking neighbor.  But he asked to help you.  No.  Can I help you?  Like, what are you doing up here?  Oh, I thought he was actually saying, can I help you with that? 
[00:08:00]  Look, I know I don't...  And then I'm like, wow, why is he getting mad that the guy wants to assist him with his garbage?  Oh, okay.  That's probably what the guy managed to do.  You probably hated him so much, and he didn't know who he was finally...  Can I help you?  Like, can I get the door for you?  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like, shut the fuck up.  Throw yourself through the window.  This guy's an asshole.  Like, why else would I be this high up in the building, you idiot?  And I've tried to have a little chit-chat conversation, like you're my neighbor.  How about we acknowledge we're neighbors, idiot?  So it's like, can I help you?  Like, can I help you?  Like, what are you doing up here? 
[00:08:30]  What are you doing up here?  Like, I direct garbage through hallways of places.  Right, I know I don't dress the part, but Jesus Christ, I introduced myself a few times that you should know who I am.  What did you say to him?  I said exactly that.  I go, are you fucking kidding me?  I'm your fucking neighbor.  And then he went into his apartment, and by the time I came back from the garbage chute, he came out with a solid apology.  Like, oh, I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, he did apologize?  What do you think I am, the help?  Yeah.  Well, I know I dress.  He thought you were the help.  I dress like the help.  So maybe it's my problem. 
[00:09:00]  And then the other guy on my floor is Winston, the karaoke king, who has karaoke parties.  Now, he has invited you to a party.  Well, not...  You crashed his party?  Yeah, well, it was New Year's.  Jimmy came over for New Year's.  And after Jimmy left, the girls decided to go wander and knock on Winston's door, because we see his disco ball from our bedroom.  And it's like a light show in there.  If you lean way over, you can see into his, not his bedroom, it's like his living room area. 
[00:09:30]  And there's a huge, like, disco ball, and the music just pump into, and the lights go with the music, that type of thing.  So New Year's Eve, the girls decided to knock on the door with some drinks.  Yes, and we got to meet Winston, the karaoke king.  Well, that's a plus.  No more contact with him since then, though?  Every time we see him, we yell, Winston, like we did New Year's.  But I don't know.  He's like, oh, shut up.  Who are these people?  I was drunk.  Well, New Year's, you know, we went in there, and he had all his Asian friends, and they were singing karaoke. 
[00:10:00]  Well, yeah.  And they were singing it like all the YouTube videos, by the way, that we've all seen, that we've got to make believe we've never acknowledged.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, they're singing with the horrendous...  With the little inflection on their voice that is a little different than...  Little.  Yeah, the little.  I was living a YouTube video, trying to keep a straight face, and it's New Year's, and they were a bunch of duds, except for Winston.  Not sure about Winston. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  But Winston had a, you know, he's got a girl.  I'm not sure what you mean.  Not quite sure.  But I'm not sure about Winston, but he has a girl.  So, you know, and they're just sitting on the couch, barely socializing with anybody, and waiting for their turn.  Yeah.  Waiting for their turn to do karaoke.  Video karaoke.  Is that the only other apartment in that building you've been in?  Like, as far as being invited in?  Well, then there's the girl from Chicago, who's pretty cool, a couple floors down.  I've been in hers to check out what she did with her place when we were, like, remodeling. 
[00:11:00]  But she has a bunch of kids and stuff.  But the guy seems cool, too, though.  I've been in one...  We can almost be friends with them.  Almost.  I've been in one apartment in my building.  Me and Florentine, this guy Tony, who works for MTV, who I know from before I lived there...  Right.  ...lives on the sixth floor of our building, and he had a little Christmas get-together.  But him, I know.  That doesn't even count.  I haven't met one person and then been invited into their apartment.  What is that about?  So...  I'm not looking for, like, these, like, you know, lifetime friends, just some acquaintances  where, hey, what's up? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  You know, what have you been up to?  Or whatever.  My guess is that a building like ours, mine and yours, are probably more...  They're not, like, buildings people live in their whole lives.  Like, there's not a neighborhood feeling to our building.  It's just, like, a lot of people who probably moved into New York.  Or, like, you know, you see the older buildings.  People have been there 25 years.  Right.  It's probably more like, this is my neighbor I know my whole life.  Right, right, yeah.  But with us, it's like, we're working and fucking...  I actually don't want to know them either.  Like, there's a guy in my gym I see.  He's kind of a heavy guy.  He's, you know, he's probably trying to lose, like, 80 pounds.  And he sees me and he asks me, like, I tell you, he asks me workout questions. 
[00:12:00]  Like, I'm his workout idol.  It's like, dude, do you see the shape I'm in?  What are you asking me questions for?  Workout idol.  Hey, I'm his hero.  He thinks I'm everything.  You know, without...  No, you're stupid.  Without me, the fucking sun doesn't shine as far as this guy's concerned.  That's really funny.  He can't get enough of me.  I see him the other day, and I always have my headphones on, and I see his lips moving.  I'm like, why is he talking to me?  What is this for?  So I pulled off.  I'm like, what's that?  And he goes, hey, you're getting stronger.  Yeah.  I'm like, what do you mean?  I didn't step up.  Yeah, you know, I just, like, grumble, acknowledge. 
[00:12:30]  Like, yeah, I had to come back on.  Don't talk to that.  My goal is to get strong enough to beat the shit out of you when you talk to me.  Yeah, exactly.  That's really what I want to do with this.  That's why I'm here.  To punch you in the left side of your chest.  Do you get along with, like, the help in your building?  Yes.  I'm friends with all the help.  I'm going to just call them the help, but I'm friends with all them.  Like, the doormen, the guys at the front desk, the maintenance guys, the garbage guys.  I will talk my ass off with every single one of them.  Yeah.  And I feel more comfortable talking to those guys, to be honest with you. 
[00:13:00]  Well, they're probably happy because a lot of celebrities probably don't talk to them.  If you're talking to them, a lot of the celebrities are rude.  How about this?  No one talks to these guys because they're way below these people.  And I talk to them all the time, man.  There's a lot of celebrities in the building.  At least where I live, my neighbor, and I put up a bunch of trees and shit and a fence  and everything like that because I got the pool.  My neighbor to, well, one side of me, decided he also was going to plant some trees in between 
[00:13:30]  the trees I planted.  Oh, that means he hates you.  So I'm just like, you know what, though?  When I saw them doing that, I was like, good.  I go, thank God.  He's of the same mindset I am.  Block it off like they're not even there.  Is he the one that tried?  No, no.  Oh, okay.  The one that tried I haven't heard from in years.  Yeah, no, no.  I got another guy.  They moved in maybe a year ago.  And they haven't tried at all?  Not an attempt.  Older than you, younger, family, what's the deal? 
[00:14:00]  Younger, guy and a girl, couple of kids.  They have a grandmother or a nanny or something that takes care of the kids.  She takes them outside to play and every so often.  But for the most part, I don't think I've seen the guy or her or the wife, for that matter.  I see the car pull up.  You know, they have nice cars, and then that's the only time I see them.  Not a nod, not a little wave, not a hey neighbor, how you doing?  The last interaction with any of them was when one of the kids threw the basketball over, 
[00:14:30]  because they put the basketball hoop right by my trees and fence, by the pool.  So it popped over the fence, and Danny just, like, threw it back at him.  Yeah, but that's stupid.  You're stupid.  Why?  No offense.  What should I do?  You should take one of those sick army knives you got and just pop basketballs.  Pop it and kick it back over.  Kick it back, and you know what?  They'll move that basketball hoop within a month.  How about you shoot it as it's coming over?  Pull! 
[00:15:00]  You pop a few basketballs and go, I don't know what happened.  I got a lot of sharp objects on the side of the fence.  I don't know, a sharp rock.  It hit a sharp bush.  You'll hear the, you know, you'll hear them digging up that freaking, actually the best,  wow, I just dated myself, sorry.  No, it's on a lot of rollers.  I stopped myself.  See, I'm old school.  When we got a basketball hoop, it was an all-day thing where you dig the little hole,  and you freaking put the cement in, and you get the pole just right.  Yeah.  Not no more, right?  No, now they just roll it out on some wheels, and the base has some shit in it, 
[00:15:30]  and water or cement or something, and you're right there.  So they can roll it anywhere, and there's plenty of places in their driveway.  They've seen it.  Know what you should do?  You should just have a recording.  Somehow, like, I don't know, like the basketball goes over, and it starts the recording,  and the little kid just hears, Jesus Christ, not again!  I can't believe it.  And my gates are locked, so they can't even, like, pop in to get in there, you know, 
[00:16:00]  to get their basketball.  That was always scary as a kid, when you lost a basketball or a baseball in someone else's yard.  In the crazy neighbor's yard.  You just didn't know, like, what you were going to, like, get on the other side,  especially if you were visiting, like, you know, someone else's house.  Yeah, maybe a giant dog.  Maybe they knew, but you didn't know, and you're like, all right, I'll go get it.  And all of a sudden, like, I don't know, it got cloudy when you went over the fence,  and it got a little colder.  Creepy.  The colors faded a little bit.  I don't know.  Where is it? 
[00:16:30]  We're in someone else's yard.  We're not supposed to be here.  Where's the ball?  Find it.  And every once in a while, it's way up near, like, the doors and stuff, and you're like,  oh, my God.  As a little kid, that was everything.  Hey, you kids.  What are you doing in my yard?  Nasty.  We used to throw rocks at one of my friend's neighbors.  Throw rocks?  That's what kids do to the neighborhood weirdo.  Well, supposedly, we thought, in our wisdom, we were 11, that she was a witch.  Yeah, you'll come up with little stories like that about the neighbors. 
[00:17:00]  And she would be out there raking leaves, and we would throw rocks at her, because that was  the thing to do.  It made sense at the time.  Throw rocks at the witch.  Of course.  You know, I mean, then fast forward, and my mom said, maybe it's not good to hang out  with this kid.  And I think she was right, because I think he ended up going to jail years later for some  horrendous thing.  I had some weird friends, man, when I was a kid.  One of them came over the house, and he started talking about how he would go to his friend's,  another friend's house, and how the friend's sister would take her clothes off. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, I used to love those stories.  And shit.  Yeah.  And I was like, wow, really?  And I wasn't even thinking about it.  I had no interest in that or anything.  He goes, yeah, yeah, she would take her clothes off and stuff.  And then he was like, hey, where's your sister?  Yeah.  And I'm like, I don't know.  She's playing somewhere.  Oh, call her down here.  Oh, Dawn.  Dawn, come down here.  And then the kid actually was like trying to get her clothes off, and my mom heard from  upstairs.  And she was like, get up here. 
[00:18:00]  You.  Go home.  And she was like, I never want to see that motherfucker in this house again.  How old was he?  He was probably seven.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was that young.  It was one of those things where I was just like, yeah, yeah, I think me and Jimmy had  bumped into each other back then.  Who threw the kid out?  My mom.  Oh, wow, man.  Because she heard like the basement door was open.  Yeah.  And she heard like the conversation.  And then when he asked to let Dawn come downstairs, my mom was like, all right, that's fucking  it. 
[00:18:30]  You out.  She goes, get out.  And she goes, I never want to see that guy in this house again.  I don't want you to hang out.  I'm like, what?  I don't understand.  Huh.  It's very inappropriate.  Yeah, seven.  Goddamn.  What a pervert.  That guy's probably fucking in prison for rape and pedophilia and fucking murder.  You remember weird scoldings, though.  Like I used to hang out with this kid named John.  I think his name was John.  Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt.  That is exactly it.  But he changed it to ball sniffer.  Oh, OK.  But I remember I was at his house and he had a sister and his sister was trying to sit on 
[00:19:00]  the beanbag chair and I wanted to sit on it.  I wouldn't let her sit on it.  And I remember the mother coming going, let her sit on that chair and just scolding me.  It's like weird that I remember that.  And that's, I was a little, wait, the kid was probably four and I might have been 30.  I don't know why.  No, we were probably both about five years old, six or maybe 10 years old.  It's like you, what are these weird little moments you remember?  Like that was always stood out for me getting scolded.  And that, because it's probably very inappropriate.  But she wasn't mean about it. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So let her sit there.  Yeah.  Great.  It's nothing better for a parent, I think, than yelling at other people's kids.  It's so easy.  Hey, asshole, get the fuck out of here.  Well, you can't do that anymore.  No, no.  You know, I used to have many, many parents.  Remember that?  You would go over someone's house and all of a sudden get yelled and screamed at by,  who are you?  You're not my mom or dad.  They'd actually yell at you.  Some would hit.  Because it was the era of hitting.  Yeah.  Some would discipline you with a nice beating.  I'm like, what the fuck? 
[00:20:00]  Fucking punch to the stomach.  I'd left my house to get away from this shit.  What are you doing?  Have you arrested?  Right.  Let's say hi to Bill in Arizona.  Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  When I was a kid, we had this neighbor named Crazy Bill.  He, you know, a yard looked like a junkyard and crap.  We used to lose balls and stuff.  And we were always told, you know, just leave them.  We'll buy you a new one, stuff like that.  Well, come to find out, like 10 years ago, he ended up stabbing a neighbor to death in 
[00:20:30]  the front yard.  Why?  Over what?  Nice neighbor.  Rumor was something about stealing rabbits.  Jesus.  Mice and men?  Rabbits.  Yeah, what the fuck is that about?  Mice and men.  George shot him by a leg.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, man.  Thank you, man.  Wow, I didn't even know we were going to talk about neighbors, but whatever.  Oh, yeah.  So that's why I leave New York City as much as I can.  Crazy neighbors.  No, but I was down in Philly for Karen Buck's surprise birthday party. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, huh?  We worked with her at YSP.  Yes, we did.  Saw a lot of the YSP gang from the old days.  Oh, yeah?  All the people that got fired that made the place what it was.  What do they do now?  Because it's kind of hard to get out.  A lot of Internet things going on with these people.  Is that it?  Yeah, it was great to see them.  They were all the people that made YSP like a powerhouse, and the company that we used to  work for saw it another way and got rid of everybody.  And now, rumor has it, Danny Bonaduce down there is in 22nd place, I heard.  That's good.  Really? 
[00:21:30]  22nd place.  That's what I heard.  I want to look it up today.  That's wonderful.  Because, you know, our bosses said, oh, well, you know, we're going to go with Danny.  It's their decision.  Yeah.  When we were trying to get back in the Philly market.  Thanks for nothing.  They're going to try Danny.  You know, we'll see what happens with that, and then we'll get back to you.  Yeah.  So.  And now we have, you know, we like Danny.  Yeah, it's not about him.  You know, it isn't about him.  Great success.  Great success.  Yeah, it's just the infinite wisdom of the people over there. 
[00:22:00]  So, ugh.  You know what?  I woke up Saturday.  I was telling you.  And I'm like, man, Ant and I just live completely different lives.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I was in bed Friday.  I'm setting this up.  I was in bed Friday.  Maybe I might have made it to like 1230.  Mm-hmm.  And I was up early.  And I was like just on the internet, and I got word that you were still live from the compound.  Yes.  I'm like, wow, Ant.  And this is how stupid I am. 
[00:22:30]  Wow, Ant's up early.  Are you doing like a little early morning broadcast?  And then I did a little more research and found out, no, he's trying to get to 930 in the morning so we can complete a 12-hour live from the compound broadcast.  Yeah.  So I'm like, holy shit.  Yeah, I wanted to do it.  So I popped on for literally your last seven minutes.  Wow, that must have been.  Literally the last seven minutes when you were wrapping up.  Just trying to stretch it out to 930.  A 12-hour broadcast.  Yeah, it started out, well, see, the thing is, when I got home from the show Friday, I was like, eh, you know, I'm taking a nap. 
[00:23:00]  And I slept until about 630 Friday night.  So I was up as a pup.  Up as a pup.  Ready to go.  So then, you know, a bunch of people come over, hanging out, fire up the old transmitter, and just start broadcasting about 930 or so.  Wow.  And then we were just drinking and talking, and people were coming in and out and leaving and coming in. 
[00:23:30]  So I just figured, fuck it.  I'll stay on.  And then you look at the clock and realize how quick time goes.  And I was like, you know something?  I'm not even tired.  I might as well do it.  What am I going to do?  Stop broadcasting and then just sit in front of the TV or go into bed and lay there?  So I figured, ah, fuck it.  I'm going to see if I can go 12 hours straight.  So I did a 12-hour marathon on the Live at the Compound. 
[00:24:00]  And, yeah, I was talking earlier how nice it is.  You can watch the complete degradation from part one.  I think there are eight or nine parts to that show up there now that are just rebroadcasting.  And part one, we've had a couple.  But me and Danny start.  We're just sitting, drinking some Guinness, having fun.  By the end, or actually by the middle, you can really see, like, alcohol is taking effect.  And we're just babbling about Dr. Michiou Kaku's theories drunkenly about Back to the Future Time rules. 
[00:24:30]  Was there a lot of, was there a lot of docs?  Here's, here's, here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  I think at one point I actually said.  That motherfucker doesn't even know what he's talking about.  I think I did at one point.  I just went, Michiou Kaku is a fucking asshole.  I'm going to fucking tell you why.  He dismissed me.  Like, no, no, no.  He dismissed me.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That's exactly what it gets down to.  What, you want to fight?  It's a broadcast you really want to check into from beginning to end. 
[00:25:00]  I mean, stick it out.  Because you will see, it starts off fun with a couple of beers and it just ends in like,  fuck that guy.  What an asshole.  What scared me about watching the last seven minutes, and that's, that's the only reference  point I got.  I'm like, I'm thinking to myself, because you mentioned you had only like four beers since  four in the morning or something like that.  Yeah, I was milking it.  Not that I'm keeping track, but it's, it's important to what I'm saying.  I'm like, all right, if he's saying he only had four or five beers since four in the morning, 
[00:25:30]  that means he had a lot of beers before four in the morning.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting there going, first of all, I put myself in your, in your, in your body.  And I'm like, I don't know how the fuck he does it.  And then I'm like, I think he drank himself sober.  That was my thought.  Time went by.  Because there was, there was barely a clue that you were, A, drunk, B, really tired.  Okay, that got a little crazy.  What are you doing?  That was, this was late at night.  Oh, wow.  I put up the Rihanna pictures as my background because someone said, hey, Rihanna is naked on the Internet. 
[00:26:00]  I go, all right, let me punch it up.  So I have the capability of punching it up and then putting it on the green screen behind me.  So then what I was doing was virtually licking her ass.  That's the type of entertainment you'll get live at the compound, my friend.  Well, you know what?  When you see an ass like that, you got to.  And we've all seen the Rihanna pictures by now.  Yeah.  Who knew that that, that, that, that ass was hiding under those clothes?  Danny's raising his hand.  Yeah, but Danny's raising his hand because he likes the big booty. 
[00:26:30]  I'm talking about when you see the big booty in the pants, you're like, that's got to be messy.  And then you see without the clothes on, you're like, dear God.  She's got a very slender waist is what it is, too.  So it kind of really shows up.  She had a dark crack, though.  That crack in one of the shots is like, wow, that's like the abyss.  Yeah, that's nice.  Somebody was able to screen cap that one.  Jesus.  Boy, I wonder who put the pictures up, huh?  Jesus. 
[00:27:00]  Just leave, leave the chick alone.  All right.  Yeah.  That guy seems like he's got some major fucking issues.  Look how deep and dark that is.  That is nice.  The crack is lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.  The picture of her ass in the mirror is just a solid, solid shot.  That is juicy, man.  Juicy?  Mm-hmm.  And smooth.  She's sexy.  If you turn your head sideways, it looks like a lobster claw.  There's a little frontal nudity. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, look at that.  Wait, where the fuck are all these pictures?  I saw the basic ones.  I saw the basic six.  Come on, yo.  She sent me those, and I was just so mad at her.  I finally just released them.  Yeah.  Wow.  I only saw, like, I got to go deeper on this one.  Yeah, you go deep.  Look at her.  She's holding herself, so you really can't see any real vag area, but you know it's there.  Dude, I was on one with Tyler Durden, dude.  What did I do wrong where I didn't get all the shots?  WWTDD.com. 
[00:28:00]  Well, I know when you see a headline that says, you know, gee, I wonder who leaked these, and  then it's obviously Rihanna.  You actually should spend some time reading the actual text that follows underneath.  Who the fuck reads when you see pictures like this?  That's what I'm saying, because it does say, blah, blah, blah, pictures of Rihanna in various stages of Undress, and then in parentheses, including the one full frontal naked money shot here with a nice link.  Ah, see, so it's a link.  It ain't a thumbnail.  See, I got to start reading again.  Yeah, reading is stupid, though.  I saw the pictures.  I'm like, okay, I know what to do here, and you just start clicking away. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  I didn't know you had to read to get more.  Read a little bit.  Well, I'm going to spend time on that a little later this morning.  Then I got to, I went to bed pretty much at noon on Saturday.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  But some saying you turned on the Jägermeister machine around 1 a.m.?  I think before that.  Was it before that?  Yeah.  Before that, the Jäger started.  Jesus.  It was only a couple of shots.  We had to get the thing working and make sure that they were icy cold.  So it's up and running? 
[00:29:00]  Because the first couple were warm.  Yeah.  So we got some ice-cold Jäger shots, some Guinness, switched to Bud Light.  And then I hung out.  I wound up going to sleep at about noon on Saturday, and I did not wake up until 11.30  Saturday night, at which time I checked my messages, and little Jimmy Norton had texted  me, and I felt very bad because it was about 8 o'clock, 8.30 or so, saying, you're still  having people over.  And I had said on Friday night slash Saturday morning that I really wanted Jimmy to come 
[00:29:30]  in, and it would be fun to have him on the show, and I was thinking of actually getting  a Craigslist chick just to come down and just have a little fun on cam.  Nice.  You know?  Wow.  Hey, sit here naked and just fucking, you know, do what we tell you to do.  Nice.  Why not?  And then pay her right on the camera for the authorities.  Yeah, right on cam.  We just fucking fork over some dollars.  Take it real easy for the authorities.  And have video of a prostitution exchange happening. 
[00:30:00]  Not at all.  That's an acting gig.  It's different.  It is an acting gig.  It's an acting gig.  There aren't any sexual favors going on.  I like how Jimmy thinks.  There wouldn't be that going on, but it would be, here you are.  You let Anthony's Robert Frost reference go.  Thank you, Mark, from New Hampshire.  Oh, is that what that was?  I figured you got it from somewhere.  And let me just burst your bubble thinking I'm smart.  I got that from a movie called Telefon with Charles Bronson.  So I have no idea that it was Robert Frost. 
[00:30:30]  I just remember it.  What was it?  Telefon.  I don't understand the...  The woods are lovely, dark and deep.  Right.  But I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.  And that was Robert Frost.  But in the movie, there was this guy, and it was almost like the Manchurian Candidate.  They had these plants all over the place, these people all over, that if you said that  to them, they would go, miles to go before I sleep, hang the phone up, and assassinate  somebody.  And they would just be the guy that works at the garage, a grandmother, and they'd know 
[00:31:00]  where to go to dig up a gun.  And then they'd go to the person they want to kill and just shoot them.  That sounds like a great movie.  Yeah, it's like Manchurian Candidate kind of thing.  I'm sure Robert Frost is thrilled that that's how his work is being interpreted years later.  Yeah, right?  It goes to a movie.  It's like, great, thanks.  This is not what I had in mind when I sat down with my pen and paper.  And penned this.  My quill.  My quill.  And ink.  And when did he live?  I don't even know.  I don't know.  When Robert Frost was alive? 
[00:31:30]  He was a dumb poet.  No idea.  He could still be alive.  I don't know.  He was a dumb poet.  He was a stupid poet.  He didn't know it.  Never mind.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'll read a fine novel every once in a while.  That poetry shit, though?  Yeah.  Rough.  I don't get it.  Even when Morrison was attempting to do poetry, I couldn't get involved.  Couldn't get involved.  Did you ever get involved with poetry?  Never.  Even just to...  Bored me.  Not to get faggoty or anything, but just to try to go, all right, what is this about?  A Nantucket limerick.  That's about it. 
[00:32:00]  That's as close to poetry as I'll ever get.  I read poems and stuff here and there, and I'm like, what?  What are you getting at?  What am I supposed to be getting from this?  I actually wrote a book of poems called The Golden Bough.  The Golden Bough.  Yeah.  And what did that represent?  I don't even know.  Nothing.  I just wrote it.  The girl bending over in a curtsy and pissing on you?  No, no.  B-O-U-G-H.  The Golden Bough.  Oh, Bough.  Collection of Jim Norton's poems. 
[00:32:30]  Yes.  No one will ever remember it.  It's what, I believe, the book Brando was reading from in Apocalypse Now that he threw  at Dennis Hopper.  You know something?  That's great.  I did not know that.  They teach young men to drop fire on people, but they cannot write fuck on their airplanes  because it is obscene.  I think he wrote that one, actually.  Colonel Kurtz.  It's a good poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue.  Decapitate, chef. 
[00:33:00]  Throw the head in Martin Sheen's lap.  But yeah, poems annoy me.  They annoy me for some reason.  I never get what I'm supposed to get out of them.  I think they're very pompous and people that write them think much too much of them and  themselves.  Well, and who decided that poems don't have to rhyme?  Yeah.  That's when I get crazy about them, especially.  The non-rhyming poem. 
[00:33:30]  At least rhyming, there's some talent in there.  You've got to find a word that rhymes.  It's like songwriting.  How about you just tell us what you're thinking?  Yeah.  Stop making it so vague.  Yeah, you've got to equate it with a leaf in the wind.  What do you think this means?  I don't know.  Hair like golden embers, heart like a stone, fall from the trees.  Oh, shut up.  What?  What are you talking about?  You're a cuckold.  You're a cuckold.  The bull prepareth him.  What does this poem mean to you?  My mouth be full of the bull. 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  The shaft it darketh against my wife's alabaster hiney.  Yeah, you've got to stay away.  By the way, going back to that Craigslist, you've got to stay away from that bit.  Why is that?  Oh, they're looking into that Craigslist big time.  Yeah, but what if it's just, like Jim said, an acting gig?  I want a chick to come down live at the compound.  It's a program, an internet program, where she comes on. 
[00:34:30]  I'll have a release filled out, and then have her just sit there naked, and then maybe do  a few, like, acting, like tricks.  You're trying to tell Jim and I that you're using logic as far as the compound goes?  We might drink a little bit.  That's what I'm saying.  Trust me.  The authorities are in deep with this Craigslist.  They want those sex sites shut down on the Craigslist. 
[00:35:00]  There's no money for sex.  I want an actress to come down and disrobe on my program.  Why can't I do that?  You can't.  And then pay her for her acting ability.  But she's not going to be able to help herself, and she's going to be like...  She's just going to be sucking dicks?  I've got to suck a dick!  She's going to be taking the guns and shoving them up her pussy.  There's no guns in the room with a friggin' actress. 
[00:35:30]  She's not going to be able to help herself.  She's going to need to plug the holes.  But the only problem with having people like that over is, like, it's like, you're a gun  owner, but they don't...  Like, you're going to be allowing people to just walk in and see your apartment, or your  house, I mean?  You're inviting home invasions.  You're inviting...  By allowing a certain element into your house, just people who are sucking dick for money  online, people are going to see that fucking house and go, this guy just hangs out and  drinks with his dumb friends?  Man, we can fucking...  You're nuts.  That's a bad idea. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  You can't let people in your place.  Maybe if I go and blindfold her and bring her in a closed...  I could have her help me with a couch, loading it into a van, and then beat her over the  head.  Would you?  Would you?  Hey, go Batman.  Thank you.  Go Batman.  Meet her at a mall.  Blindfold.  Blindfold her and bring her to the Batcave.  Bring her to the compound there, and downstairs, blindfolds off, clothes are off.  After the job is done, we cut her up.  Oh, I mean, we let her...  Oh, yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Because I think it's funny if you get a bunch of trannies and you have a biggest penis contest.  A big cock contest.  And you make the winner jump in a circle with their penis flopping.  I'm in.  Uh, yeah.  Well, it's, you know, anything can happen over there.  I have no clue, so...  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  We're just getting started.  When we come back, can we discuss, at one point at least, Wanda? 
[00:37:00]  Too many of those, by the way.  Oh, we'll do it right after the break.  We got some clips and everything.  Oh, you got Wanda clips?  Good.  Yeah.  Wanda Sykes going after Obama a little bit.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know if we got her...  Hopefully, we got part of her set.  Wanda has fucking balls.  Is this a good set?  I only saw a couple of clips.  I heard just a couple of quick clips so far.  Keith went with her.  Keith was bragging, I'm going to get to meet the president.  Did he?  He probably did.  I haven't talked to him.  Keith Robinson?  He went with Wanda, and she said some fucking Rush... 
[00:37:30]  Not about Obama.  She loves Obama.  But she blasted Rush Limbaugh, but she pulled some...  I couldn't fucking believe the material she did.  Wow.  She's a funny, funny lady.  But there's a...  Mike Lubica wrote a great...  She's a funny lady.  A brilliant actual article today in the Daily News.  All right.  We'll get into it after the break, definitely.  We do a thing called Backstage with ONA, and on Friday...  Danny, you attempted a joke on...  I don't even remember anymore.  Star Trek or something?  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was just rolling with it, and it didn't work out for me so well.  Is that how you jumped up and banged into the wall? 
[00:38:00]  He couldn't get it out fast enough.  I love it.  Yeah, it didn't...  I don't know.  Maybe we weren't listening.  Something was going on, and it failed miserably.  So Sam caught up with Danny in the hallways and came up with this.  And now, Backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and some bad news came to ONA producer Danny, as recently on  the show, he let out a joke that was so bad, it stopped the program in its tracks. 
[00:38:30]  I have to go to sickbay to see bones.  I guess he saw bones and then went to sickbay.  Boo, again.  No, the best part of that was Danny's get-out-of-my-way gem coming.  He jumped up and crashed in like, folks, where do you get a load of this?  We found Danny to try to get to the bottom of what exactly went wrong.  Excuse me, Danny.  People are telling me you're very, very upset about what happened in the studio. 
[00:39:00]  What happened?  Danny, can you hear me?  I'm falling for your shit.  Danny was mums the word about his bomb, but Opie and Anthony engineer Mars was standing  by giggling, so we went to him for the scoop.  Mars, what do you think happened?  I think he bombed.  Why is Mars taking pride in something so negative?  He gets upset because he fucks up so much, so when he sees somebody else fuck up, all the  pressure's alleviated off of him and projected onto the next guy. 
[00:39:30]  Is this what it is, Mars?  Is it because you're so bad at everything?  Actually, I'm very good at everything that I do, but it's lovely to see.  Did you see Mars break the studio earlier today where the crown molding fell off?  Mars, you did break the door.  Mars, where are you going?  While Danny and Mars continued to argue about the door, we went out and asked some of the  other ONA staff members exactly how they felt about Danny bombing.  Hey, Travis.  Why do you think Danny's so upset about that bomb?  He won't talk to me. 
[00:40:00]  Probably because it was a terrible, terrible bomb.  Is this why when you tell jokes, you don't tell them on the air?  That's correct.  I keep them to myself.  Excuse me, Steve.  Danny just made a terrible bomb in the studio, and now he's very upset and won't talk to  me.  What do you think's wrong?  That's unfortunate.  You want to...  Why are you smiling, Steve?  I love when I'm not the one getting picked on.  That's really it.  You're gay.  Thank you.  Cheer up, Danny.  No matter how bad your joke was, at least you're not Steve C. 
[00:40:30]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Opie and Anthony, little Jimmy Norton, and you listening.  Thank you.  I don't even know if I told you, because we haven't talked since Friday.  What's that game?  I was leaving the building Friday, and I ran into Scott Greenstein, one of the big wigs  here at SiriusXM.  And he obviously had something important to tell me, because he was on a cell phone call, 
[00:41:00]  and he went, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.  And then he put his phone down, covered it up.  So that person went here.  Right.  And said, I want to let you know that the listening is way up for you guys.  Nice.  Way up.  That's what I like to hear.  Online listening, and I'm not sure if listening in general.  Definitely online listening, because I guess they could keep track of that pretty accurately.  Yep.  And he goes, you guys are way up.  And then he goes, you guys are officially back. 
[00:41:30]  You're officially back.  I'm like, what?  Where were we?  Yeah, we've been back forever, doing very well.  Okay.  No, but I don't even acknowledge that.  Now that you're in my building, you're officially back.  You're officially back.  I wanted to tell him, well, when we sell our comedy shows in front of 10,000, 12,000, sometimes people.  Where were we then?  Where were we then?  Well, you know something?  We weren't here.  Right.  So that's...  So according to him, we're officially back, Anthony.  Pretty much that.  Even though we've been at this, what, four and a half years now. 
[00:42:00]  Why do I still get mailers like a subscriber, though?  Oh, do you really?  Yeah.  I still get mailers like, hey, would you like Sirius XM satellite radio?  Here's what you got to do.  Call this number.  I'm like, what?  I work there.  And then he did what corporate people do.  He passed the buck.  He's like, talk to Blatter for more details.  So I guess we got to talk to Steve today about details on how well we're doing.  I got to apologize to Steve Blatter.  Why?  Because he did call me and left a message for me. 
[00:42:30]  Uh-oh.  But my conscious hours this weekend did not allow me to call anyone back.  I could not call anyone at three in the morning.  It was just one of those things where it's like I wasn't up during the hours you call people.  You bring up a great point, conscious hours.  Yeah.  You find yourself like, I wake up sometimes, sorry.  No, go ahead.  That was about it.  No, you just made me think of something.  That's all.  I have to just apologize to him that I did not return his call. 
[00:43:00]  And I felt that I don't want him to think I was avoiding him or anything.  Conscious hours, when you do morning radio, I mean, you get into, in my world, waking  up Saturday morning at six is not insane.  It happens.  Wow.  And I'm ready to go, too.  Ready to go.  Like, wide awake.  We are two different modes, man.  Holy shit.  And it's conscious hours where I'm like, well, I got a lot of phone calls that I've been avoiding.  Not avoiding, but putting.  Have I been avoiding?  I mean.  You know what?  Some of them probably.  Of course there are some. 
[00:43:30]  Maybe that was a Freudian slip, but avoiding or putting off.  And I'm like, you know what?  I feel great.  I've had my coffee.  I'm going to, like, catch up with people.  And then you start dialing, because you don't know any better, and you're waking people up.  What are you doing?  It's Saturday, dude.  What the fuck?  Who dies?  Sleeping here.  Do I have to go get my suit pressed?  What happened?  No, I just wanted to, you know, you called me.  And then I sit there like, all right, I got to wait till at least 10 or 11.  And then by that time, I got to go back to bed for a quick nap. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Because I've been up too early.  It just never syncs up.  Nope.  It really is a pain in the ass, just the getting up thing.  And just communicating with real people.  Yeah.  With people that don't do morning radio.  Right.  Oof.  It is tough.  Because I get a lot of shit from my family, especially things like that.  It's like, well, you know, oh, well, you didn't return this call or that one.  It's like, you know, I'd love to.  Are you up at 2.30 in the morning?  Because I'll ring you. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, so it's not me.  No, it's everybody.  If you're not even calling your family back, that's a good sign.  Believe me.  I got more messages from Sal.  Where's my cooler?  I need the cooler over the house.  I dropped it off there for your party last summer.  I need my cooler.  Call me, Anthony.  Why does he need a cooler?  I don't know.  Dead hooker?  I have no idea.  But he needed the cooler.  The cooler.  And I was asleep.  He actually wound up coming over the house, grabbing the cooler and leaving, never seeing me. 
[00:45:00]  I was up in the bedroom, sleeping.  We're kind of stalling because we're getting the Wanda Sykes Club, which is fine.  Wanda Sykes.  And we got President Obama, the correspondence dinner where, you know, the president gets to be a comedian.  Yeah, the president gets to do a few minutes as a comic.  Why can't comics get to be the president for a day?  Yeah, let Jimmy be president for a day.  Jimmy, would you like to be president for the day?  I would like that a lot.  I got the coolest thing.  I would make three-day week eggs.  Yeah.  But it would be Saturday, Monday, and Wednesday. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, you would fuck up the three-day week for everybody.  They could make me president, but they just don't have enough ships.  Oh, Anthony.  Do not give yourself a bell.  I didn't say anything.  I like a large navy is what I meant.  I'd like a large navy to defend our shores.  Jesus.  Well, what kind of cruise ship is this?  You thought that one out ahead of time.  10,000 beds. 
[00:46:00]  Number one movie at the box office.  Let me guess.  Let me guess.  McConaughey.  Yeah.  Matthew McConaughey in that movie with the girl.  Yes.  Ex-girlfriends from fucking the past ghost thing.  You don't want me to yell, give yourself a bell.  Exactly.  Neither do the listeners.  By the way, the name of the McConaughey movie is I Gargle Cum.  Well, number five was 17 Again.  Now, I feel completely out of touch because I don't know what 17 Again is. 
[00:46:30]  It doesn't mean I need to go see the movie, but I think I at least should know what the movie is about.  It's that old gag.  They've done this a lot of times where somebody that's older gets to go back to their youth, high school, and use the knowledge they've amassed over their years to be the cool guy in school.  George Burns did it probably 20 years ago, and the movie was called 18 Again.  18 Again. 
[00:47:00]  And there was that Fred Savage and Judge Reinhold movie.  Vice versa.  And then there are the other movies with Lindsay Lohan that remade the movie, Freaky Friday.  Freaky Friday.  Very good.  Which was a remake.  The original Freaky Friday was a remake?  Yeah.  I call it the original Freaky Friday.  The original Freaky Friday.  It was a remake.  It had a, what's the name in it from Silence of the Lambs there?  Jodie Foster.  Yeah, Jodie Foster was in it when she was a kid.  There's a Dudley Moore.  A Dudley Moore one. 
[00:47:30]  My father like son.  This fucking movie has been done so many times, and the whole gist of it is you know what you  know now, but you're back in school.  That's like the thing.  Oh, if I only knew what, and you go around thinking, you know.  No, I wouldn't like that.  I'd still be a fuck up.  I'd still just be, you know.  What was like father like son about?  That was Judge Reinhold, right?  Hopefully, hopefully.  No, wasn't it Kirk Cameron?  And Dudley Moore?  And Dudley Moore.  What happens?  Kirk Cameron has a lump in his shoe and pudding in his hat. 
[00:48:00]  It's very tragic what happened to Dudley Moore.  From head to toe, he got fucked up.  He certainly did.  But he's four foot three of shit.  Everything in between was fine.  Yeah.  His life went so bad, at the end of his life, I think he was living with like a fan.  Really?  Yeah, look it up.  Like, it got really weird for Dudley Moore at the end.  Poor basket.  So, who's in 17 again?  That's Zac Efron.  The girls love the Zac Efron, huh? 
[00:48:30]  Of course they do.  All right.  Fourth place, Obsessed.  What's Obsessed about?  Obsessed.  Any clue?  I bet it's about an obsession.  You know what Obsessed is about?  No.  As a matter of fact.  No.  I have no idea.  Any help out there?  It's called like Fatal Attraction.  Is what I'm getting here.  Who's starring in it?  I want to even...  Beyonce.  Ugh.  Is in it. 
[00:49:00]  In the new Fatal Attraction?  Shouldn't she just be singing?  It's called Obsession.  Obsession.  I bet it's about a cunt and her attraction to shoes.  No, I don't think that's it.  Danny?  Somebody who's wearing perfume.  Obsessed.  Allie Lauder, the girl from Heroes, is in it.  All right.  Yeah, Beyonce is in it.  Jerry O'Connell is in it.  Oh, that makes it good right there.  Jerry O'Connell movies are always great.  Are they?  Name one.  Name one, Jerry.  I can't even name one of his movies.  I don't...  I get the O'Connell boys mixed up. 
[00:49:30]  Was he the one that was in Stand By Me?  Wasn't one of them chubby as a kid?  Yes, he was.  And they have to talk about how he got his light...  Stand By Me.  Hey, that was the last good movie he made.  He was 10.  All right.  Well, if you want to know the plot, it's a successful asset manager who has just received  a huge promotion, is blissfully happy in his career and in his marriage, but it sounds  good, but a temp worker starts stalking him.  All the things he's worked so hard for are placed in jeopardy.  Ah, yeah, Fatal Attraction.  All right.  Yep. 
[00:50:00]  Go rent Fatal Attraction.  Yeah.  Great movie.  I like the other one better, though.  The one where Rebecca DeMoray...  Oh, Rebecca DeMoray.  Yeah.  Yeah, from Risky Business is...  The Hand that Rocks the Cradle?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That scene when...  What is she, like the nanny, I guess?  And she's breastfeeding the kid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That scene rolls.  She wanted the baby to bond with her instead of the mother.  And then the mother's trying to breastfeed Lincoln.  And the kid's all upset.  The kid doesn't want anything to do with her boobs. 
[00:50:30]  She was completely being the mother to this child, and the mother was being shunned by  the baby.  And then she's like, phew, she pulls that big tit out and just starts breastfeeding.  Well, it was a stunt tit.  Yeah, it was a stunt tit, definitely.  Stunt tit, though, nothing better in movies.  But if you're editing it together where it seems like Rebecca DeMoray, then it's cool.  I felt like I was seeing her boob.  Of course.  The kid's just sitting there suckling.  There it is.  On a big flug.  Look, that's nice.  Oh, wait, that might be...  That might not be stunt tit.  Wow.  That looks pretty good.  It's not her kid.  That's great. 
[00:51:00]  That's so fantastic.  That's so twisted.  That was so dirty and taboo and hot at the same time.  And I'm not into that breastfeeding fucking fetish.  But there was just something so wrong about that.  I had so many weird feelings going through my body.  I wish my mom had boobs like that.  Oh, shit.  But then again, it would be even cooler if it wasn't my mom.  I was cheating on my mom with another boob.  That was great.  The baby just wound up hating the mother.  She was like crying anytime. 
[00:51:30]  I can't hold my baby.  And then someone who's now really famous, I think, if it's the same movie, bought it in a greenhouse, all the glass shattered.  Oh, right.  I forgot.  I haven't seen the movie in years.  I don't even know why it popped into our brains today.  But he was thrown out a window and he hit it.  It was Tony Rocky Hara.  Yeah, he was giving a Rebecca DeMornay a foot massage.  A foot massage.  I think they rigged like the windows or the ceiling or some kind of like doors to just shatter. 
[00:52:00]  The whole thing shattered down on her.  Obsessed is about a pussy whipped guy.  Let's get Kent the movie guy on the phone.  Kent.  Yeah, hey, guys, because I'm lame and I wanted to get laid this weekend.  I made a deal with my chick.  She goes to Star Trek.  I'll go see the shitty Obsessed movie with her.  What did you see first?  What did you see first?  Hold on.  Hold on, Kent.  Hold on.  Are couples really doing that shit? 
[00:52:30]  Making deals?  You don't make deals.  If you're with a cool chick, you just go, hey, I'm going to this movie.  I know you don't want to see it.  And enjoy the chick flick with your girlfriends.  Then again, then again, I was in a relationship where I was dragged to bridges of fucking Madison County.  So, all right, I guess I'm not the cool dude I thought I was.  I got to see The Love Letter.  The Love Letter?  Horrid.  So, and my chick's way too hot for me, so I pretty much do whatever you want. 
[00:53:00]  Horrid.  Yeah, this movie.  We'll just talk over Kent.  Was that the one where?  He doesn't understand.  Kent, will you shut up, please?  Kent doesn't understand sometimes.  We'll get to, oh, wait, is that Nip?  Oh, my God.  Is that from hand?  Oh, my God.  Look at the smiling baby going, I'll latch on to that.  All right, now we're definitely looking at a, we're looking at a stunt boob.  Baby, I would love to talk to the baby that was in that scene.  Kids got to be like 15 years old now.  My motivation was a tit. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  Oh, my God.  All just filled with milk.  Yeah, see, they're not filled with a face.  Just filled with nourishment.  And goodness and love.  And a big heaving mammary full of love and life-giving juice.  Yeah, let's try to make it as hot as possible, too.  Yeah, just sugary, warm love.  We got our breastfeeding fans out there.  Let's take care of them today.  I'm not even a fan of breastfeeding, although I was breastfeeding.  Just all that goodness, the boob is struggling to keep it all inside. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, such goodness.  Just leaking out, all that goodness.  It beckons you, the scent of it beckons you to come get more love.  Just nuzzled up to her bosom.  You don't understand an asshole boss or taxes or anything at that point.  Well, what nudity was that that she was doing?  Oh, hello.  Oh, hi.  What do we got here?  What's your name?  It's called Never Talk to Strangers.  Wow.  Yeah, she liked to get nude.  That's a good...  You know something?  That missionary shot is great with her legs just there and the man's ass. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  I mean, with her.  Oh, yeah.  If you're going to be in that position, the woman's got to, like, you know, she's got to  clap her heels together for you.  She's got to spur you like she's riding a bull.  I like that.  If she spurs your ass while she's fucking riding underneath you, that's a good one.  Bent legs over you with feet, like, clenched together, linked together like she's going to  put you in scissors, that is really good.  Solid.  Yeah.  Kent, so you had to go see Obsessed so your chick would go see Star Trek. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, basically.  And the whole movie is just women in charge of this one man, basically.  He works at this law firm.  This chick is attracted to him, and she basically rapes him at one point, and then Beyonce gets  all upset at him.  And what's funny is Beyonce plays the housewife who doesn't really do anything, but when she  finds out, she tells this dude to get out of her house, which just annoyed the shit out 
[00:55:30]  of me.  And, of course, this dope does it.  And it's just the whole thing is just put men in their place and powerful women, you know,  in the powerful leads.  It's just, it was garbage.  Complete garbage.  Yeah.  All right.  But you didn't need me to tell you that, so I'm going to...  Well, it was number, uh, four at the box office, though.  Stephen Pajor, Kent, you're still on the phone? 
[00:56:00]  I thought we told you to go fuck your mother.  Nice.  Bang, boom, just once.  I wish I was interesting.  Number three at the box office, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.  That's the shitty fucking cum in my hair movie.  That's the Matthew McConaughey.  Matthew McConaughey's movie.  A lot of these movies, you've got to think the people just went because Star Trek just  sold out.  That's what happens, right?  Of course.  Of course.  And Wolverine. 
[00:56:30]  Somebody else ran into me this weekend saying Wolverine's just amazing.  Really?  I think it was Will, who used to work for the channel.  Did you see Wolverine?  Yeah, I did.  I wasn't really so impressed with it.  Will, who used to work for this fine channel of ours, loved it.  We only, we had a three-hour discussion about it, I believe.  Yeah, I think it's because, I think it's because I'm a, well, at least I used to be  like a comic book nerd, you know, and I had all the books, so if anything was different  from the books, I immediately hated that, so I think that kind of played into my kind  of dislike for that film, but I mean, it wasn't a bad action flick, but I had a problem 
[00:57:00]  with some of the dialogue and some of the scenes.  It felt to me a lot like Terminator 3, at least for the first, the first 70 minutes.  It was just like a big chase scene, and then there's plot at the end.  Yeah, well.  I don't have the want or need to go see that in the movie.  Well, considering.  But I will, I do want to see Star Trek.  Yeah, Star Trek does look pretty good, and I will get around to that, but the thing that  pissed me off the most about Wolverine is that the most interesting scenes take place during  the opening credits where they show Wolverine and Sabretooth, like, throughout wars in history,  you know, like going through the Civil War, and then, like, Vietnam, and you don't want 
[00:57:30]  to see.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  If they made a movie just about that?  Yeah.  That would have been crazy.  It just, yeah.  I think they overthink everything in Hollywood.  I thought that's what they did.  I thought that was part of the movie was, like, him actually fighting in the wars, because  he's, you know, and old.  That was, like, the first, that was, like, the opening sequence.  It was about two minutes long, and then what they leave you with after those war scenes  was just, like, that, like, you went through all that just to get to this?  Like, fuck that.  It was, like, some, like, some, it was, like, some shitty mutant A-team thing, and it was  just, like, no thanks, dude. 
[00:58:00]  A movie like Wolverine should have no dialogue.  Yeah, it should just be, uh.  It should, for real.  And not for the whole movie where there's no dialogue.  And I know people, people were complaining.  There's a lot of action, but, you know, you can figure out exactly what's going on with  the action and their facial expressions and all that shit.  And people were complaining that that leaked version, like, oh, there was effects that  were unfinished and the claws weren't finished, so, you know, you can't, you know, base your  judgment on that.  But, dude, the claws look like shit.  They look like Roger Rabbit when Eddie Valiant has that cartoon gun.  Oh, my God.  That's really what his claws look like. 
[00:58:30]  Cartoon-y.  The listeners, I mean, they're, you know what, they're more than hit or miss.  They're usually pretty good.  Chris Charles in Oceanside says, check out the YouTube clip, Wolverine in 30 seconds.  Let's take a quick look at that, see what we can.  Wolverine in 30 seconds.  Yeah, Wolverine made $27 million at the box office, second place.  Fontaine, what's going on?  Yo, Fontaine.  Good evening.  What's up, Fontaine?  You know, I'm the lone black caller now.  Malik don't got no XM.  Yeah, no shit.  We lost Malik in the transition. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, damn, yo.  Unfortunately, we didn't lose Lydia, though.  She fucking decided to go out.  Nah, she came on board.  Go out and get a satellite.  Hey, that Beyonce movie.  Well, first off, that white chick, Allie Larder, holy shit is she sexy.  But the male lead in that movie is Stringer Bell, and it totally fucking took me out of that movie.  I couldn't get into it at all.  Idris or Idris Elba.  I don't know how to say his name.  I-D-R-I-S.  He was, yeah, he's from The Wires.  He's a good actor.  He was in the fucking Denzel movie.  What was the movie he just did? 
[00:59:30]  Where he plays the drug dealer?  It was called Go Fuck Your Mother.  No, it wasn't called that.  That was the title of my autobiography.  What was the name of the movie where fucking Denzel Washington plays the drug dealer?  Frank, with Russell Crowe.  Oh, oh.  American Gangster.  American Gangster.  Stringer Bell was an American Gangster.  Yes, Denzel shoots him in the head.  Oh, that's right.  In the middle of the street.  Oh, yeah, he just walks down the street.  And fucking shoots him in the head.  Shoots him and walks right back where he went.  That's another fucking movie I gotta watch that I never saw. 
[01:00:00]  American Gangster.  Dude, it's great.  He's in it very briefly.  It's a really good movie.  And didn't Stringer Bell make an appearance on The Office?  I gave up on The American Office a long time ago, but...  I never got past the pilot.  Was it Stringer Bell?  I don't know.  I never saw it.  I watched the pilot, and I didn't hate it.  I don't think they stink.  I just didn't, you know.  Hey, Fontaine, as a black dude, do you need, like, a black chick in a movie to enjoy it?  Because Hollywood has decided that's exactly what needs to be done, where they cast, like,  you know, a black woman to bring in more of the black audience. 
[01:00:30]  No, not really.  It doesn't matter.  I'm a white girl.  It doesn't matter to you, right?  No, not at all.  I only fuck white girls anyway.  Oh, there you go.  What they're trying to, in an attempt to represent everybody accurately, they're trying to represent  people, but they're shoehorning, a lot of times, people into roles where they're not  right, just for the sake of saying, hey, we're representing someone.  Yeah, look.  See, we got that.  That'll get the audience.  This'll bring in more black people.  Instead of getting them...  This'll bring in more Asians, or more women, or something, and it's, like, unnecessary to 
[01:01:00]  the story.  It's pretty obvious.  They sit down, instead of getting the best actors for each role, they go, okay, we got  to fill the black quota.  We got to get the Asian.  We got to get the kid market.  We got to get this market.  And then they...  Diversity sucks my dick.  And then they cast that way.  And it's very obvious.  Yeah, diversity sucks.  And then it's very obvious when you're watching...  Diversity does suck.  Just fucking make a good movie with the best actors.  I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  That black honeymoon is fucking sick.  Dude, worst movie ever?  Never saw it. 
[01:01:30]  Never saw it.  Don't want to see it.  Yeah.  Don't even care that it's out there.  I wouldn't even audition for it.  It's not even in my kaleidoscape, and I got some shit in there.  Thank you, Fonte.  Hey, do we have the audio of Wanda yet?  Well, after the break, I guess.  That's fine.  You're Wanda.  Number one movie at the box office, Star Trek.  They said it was supposed to make $50 million.  It made $72.5 million.  Because they added on Thursday.  Midnight, you mean.  They came in at midnight, probably.  That midnight...  It's all about starting these movies on Thursday. 
[01:02:00]  Everyone's doing it, though.  Most blockbusters, anyway.  That's a huge opener.  And I told Anthony just before the show, I'm like, this Star Trek has just made Star Wars  just obsolete, basically.  Well, yeah, because...  Because now Star Trek, with the younger cast and stuff, they could go anywhere with this  movie.  They could pretty much go anywhere.  They could pretty much go anywhere.  They could pretty much go anywhere.  They could just keep making movies now.  They could just keep making movies.  They have a whole new, young version of the original cast, so they can pretty much go up  to the original series.  Yeah, they don't have to follow the TV show, nothing.  And they could even go past the original series, because it could be stories that happen maybe 
[01:02:30]  in between the stories from the original series.  Or if they develop new characters to the point it gets up to where the TV show, I guess,  would start.  Yeah.  It's not going to matter to most of the people that have been watching the movies.  No one's going to care.  Because they're going to be like, fuck that.  I want to know more about this dude.  Yeah.  Brilliant.  I mean, that thing is...  You're going to see a million of those Star Trek movies now.  Maybe there's a new franchise they can open up with this shit.  Maybe George Lucas can make another space movie with some furry thing going...  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  He's got to be embarrassed.  Should be.  Seeing a movie like Star Trek, when he puts out that drivel with fucking Ewoks and cute  things and fucking...  Jar Jar Binks.  Ugh!  And a whining fucking crybaby Darth Vader.  Stop it.  Already.  Stop it.  Already.  And that actually goes right back to Wolverine, because there was one of those...  No! 
[01:03:30]  Moments with Wolverine.  I'm just kind of going, oh my God.  Because Wolverine wouldn't do that, right?  No, I mean...  No!  I'm being honest.  Was it the overhead shot?  Yes.  The arch back?  Yes.  The arms back?  Yes.  You look up?  Yes.  You look up?  God would not do anything!  The only thing that was missing...  A hack shot.  Dude, I know.  The only thing that would be missing is if they pan to other scenery, where you hear his screaming in  the background, like mountains and like a bridge.  And that was the only thing that was missing.  Dude, it was so stereotypically hacked for just an action movie. 
[01:04:00]  And it was just another thing about that film that I just couldn't get on.  Not too bad.  Let's go to Chris in D.C.  Chris?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  I only saw that Star Trek movie three times this weekend.  Really good.  I don't want to ruin anything for you guys who haven't seen it.  Then don't.  I won't.  But they did do a new timeline.  So they're going to be able to now introduce or do anything they want.  And it's going to have absolutely no effect on the old story.  And that's exactly what they were going for.  Yeah, that's what they were going for.  They were kind of using the popularity of Star Trek in general to get people really pumped 
[01:04:30]  about this movie.  And now that the movie's out, it doesn't matter anymore.  Now they're going to just decide what to do with this.  New timeline.  So Kirk necessarily never has to do battle for the gamesters of Triskelion.  Never might have to do that.  He never has to replace his essence with that of Sargon in the glowing ball.  So that Sargon and the bad guy that was with Sargon and Sargon's girlfriend can build 
[01:05:00]  automated bodies of themselves.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  All right.  He never, ever has to find the silicon-based life form that is killing the miners and learn  that it is an intelligent life form.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Guys, greatest movie I've ever seen in my life. 
[01:05:30]  Nice.  By the way, what they will do.  I'm so glad you had to jump in and say greatest movie of your life as ants in the middle of  a bit for the first time in three weeks.  Thanks.  Oh, shit.  Thanks, Chris.  Hey, I defy you to go back and not find a bit.  I'm joking, bro.  Fucking guy's popping in on this movie.  I know.  He's got a pop in.  You've got going on.  Now he can't go back to it.  Happens.  I would have said something like, does it mean that Spock will not lose his brain?  Somebody actually takes Spock's brain and they have to find Spock's lost brain. 
[01:06:00]  Boom!  No?  Does that mean no?  This is going great.  I hate you.  What about the, will they ever run into, because the timeline's different, and this was an important  episode, will they ever run into the hiney-headed aliens that took Captain Christopher Pike and  Kirk broke all regulations by going back to the planet when he was told not to because  Spock wanted to help his friend Captain Christopher Pike. 
[01:06:30]  Boring.  No?  Does that mean no?  Will Kirk ever get all turned on by the dancing green girl?  Or Christopher Pike, for that matter, because he was in that episode, I believe it was called  The Menagerie.  Man!  You are one pathetic loser.  Interesting.  Will they ever slingshot back in time again and screw everything up? 
[01:07:00]  Well, they did at one point.  They slingshot around, and they went back to, um...  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Or maybe it's just me.  I don't know.  I'm interested in that new timeline thing, how they figure that out.  They're going to...  Here's what they'll do.  They'll just incorporate certain...  Maybe they'll look at the series.  It was three years.  Yeah.  And they'll take things that happened in, say, five episodes in a row from the first season. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Maybe they'll incorporate them in movies and redo certain storylines, but really redo them  well.  Maybe they'll incorporate two of the episode storylines into a film and make it part of  the film, but actually redo it well, so it'll kind of explain and gobble up the series that  way.  Yeah.  Can I...  I wonder how fucked the timeline gets.  I mean, are they still enemies with the Klingons and the Romulans?  Do they know of the Romulans?  Because there was an episode in Star Trek where there was an explanation of a war with 
[01:08:00]  the Romulans, but it was so long before they didn't have any kind of scanning and they didn't  see what the Romulans looked like.  And then they made the neutral zone.  And then there was a big battle between Kirk and a Romulan ship.  And by the way, the Romulan ship was run.  And by the same guy that winds up playing Spock's father.  You need to shut the fuck up.  All right.  I like when Homer booed him.  It made me really happy. 
[01:08:30]  By the way, the faggot clip is getting rave reviews from the faggot clip.  Can I say the obvious, though, with the Star Trek movie?  Yeah.  I would say the majority of people that went to see Star Trek this weekend, it's just  a hunch.  Never saw the fucking TV show.  I think...  Never saw the fucking TV show.  Wait, wait, wait.  The diehard motherfucking Star Trek fans have seen everything Star Trek.  Is there any way to look up the demo of a particular movie?  Because anyone under...  That's tough because they don't ask for that when you buy a ticket. 
[01:09:00]  Anyone under, I would have to say, 30.  Yeah.  There's a good chance they didn't watch the Star Trek series.  Maybe.  Maybe you're right.  I don't know.  Maybe a lot of the younger demos went to see Star Trek this weekend.  If there's a new timeline, does that completely interrupt also the fact that Khan, who was  on the SS Botany Bay in the original series, then went on to be an arch-villain of Kirk in  The Wrath of Khan, the movie.  And if there's a new timeline, that completely negates Khan and then The Wrath of Khan, and 
[01:09:30]  then Spock will never have died and been brought back in Search for Spock.  Yeah.  He sure ran that one into the ground.  I have lots of questions that need answering from this Star Trek.  I'll tell you that much.  Very good.  Very good.  I like the effects. 
[01:10:00]  Star Trek, not the greatest movie.  It's like 21 when they deviate from the true story.  21.  Was that...  21.  Was that...  Daryl in Michigan.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Daryl.  No, I wasn't talking about Star Trek.  I was more talking about Wolverine.  But the whole thing is I love the character development.  And in 21, they kind of completely deviate from the fact that they, you know, are trying  to disguise themselves and not be known in Vegas. 
[01:10:30]  And they go and make it a chick flick and glamorize their trips to Vegas.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  You're right.  You're right.  You know what?  I saw that.  That drove me crazy.  What was the book called again?  Because I read the book.  Breaking Vegas.  Breaking Vegas.  Or Bustin' Vegas, right?  Breaking.  One of those.  Breaking, Bustin', Destroying, Hurting, Cracking.  And why did they have to change the name for the movie?  I forgot.  There was a reason.  21, because it was another movie.  I think it was another movie.  Not 21.  No, they turned to 221.  Yeah.  There was a reason why they couldn't use the book title. 
[01:11:00]  First mistake.  Was it called Breaking the Bank?  Or...  It was...  What the fuck?  Was it Bustin' Vegas?  I think it was Breaking Vegas.  Or Breaking Vegas.  I finally saw that, because I loved the book.  And I was...  Yeah.  I'm with you, bro.  I was very disappointed in that movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was very frustrated to see him go, oh, you know, they didn't...  They had him not dressing up or doing anything.  Bringing Down the House?  Bringing Down the House.  Bringing Down the House.  That's why.  And there was a movie called Bringing Down the House.  Very good to that...  Thank you, Fly Society.  Ooh, Fly Society?  Yes. 
[01:11:30]  The Fly Society?  The Fly Society had that first.  Thank you.  Well, God damn.  Yeah, they turned into a chick flick, and these were MIT geeks that I don't even...  Oh, they don't know what a penis was used for.  Yeah, I don't know if they've ever saw a vagina.  No.  Thank you, sir.  Aimed at under 25, new Star Trek.  Okay.  See, no way did they watch the original.  And someone under 25 won't even sit through the Star Trek series.  They would look at it as...  They think it looks silly.  Yeah, I would think...  Silly.  Let's say hi to Derek in Miami. 
[01:12:00]  Derek?  Yo.  Hey.  Even worst scene from freaking Wolverine.  He sets a helicopter on fire, walks away from it as the thing explodes behind him.  Ah!  And not even a twitch, right?  He just keeps walking.  And of course, you know, instead of just lighting a match or having...  Because, I mean, he smokes cigars.  Yeah, yeah.  He flicks the cigar?  Does he flick it?  No, but he takes his claws and makes a spark on the gasoline, you know.  I love the action figure. 
[01:12:30]  The action star who, yeah, lights the fire, just walks and is not affected by it.  And then, kaboom!  And they just keep walking.  They don't even look back.  I'd be like, holy shit.  Everyone would be.  Wow.  Yeah.  Your body would just do that.  The concussion from it would make you go like, whoa, fuck.  That took me by a surprise.  Even if you're the biggest asshole walking this earth, your body still would react to that.  It's such a hack movie moment, is what it is.  It's been done a thousand fucking times.  But I like the fact that we're looking at Wolverine's not being a realistic reaction,  and yet no one is questioning the fact that he has fucking claws coming out of his hands. 
[01:13:00]  His claws and his indestructibility, his instant healing abilities.  Good point.  Mutants.  Yeah, we're all looking at his reaction wasn't appropriate to the fire.  Why didn't he call 911?  What dorks.  Should have been arrested for arson.  Good news.  We got the Wanda Sykes set from the White House Correspondents Dinner.  You said she did well, right?  I don't know.  I only saw a couple of jokes.  One did well, but it was a rough one.  And then you got Obama making jokes. 
[01:13:30]  And I said the same thing when Bush did this.  I don't like my president telling jokes in these tough times.  Pope wrote cunt, sir.  Yeah.  Pope wrote cunt.  I'm not a fan of the president making, you know, jokes.  There was an article.  Lupica did an article today because Wanda did a couple of rough jokes about Rush Limbaugh,  which she should have done.  She did everything right.  Yeah.  But this fucking CBS golf analyst did a joke about, like, Nancy Pelosi.  He wrote in a blog.  He said if Nancy Pelosi was on the elevator with Osama bin Laden and somebody else and 
[01:14:00]  you had two bullets, Nancy Pelosi would get shot twice and bin Laden and the other guy  would be strangled.  It's kind of like a rehash.  Yeah, I've heard that.  But it's funny.  He wrote it in a blog and people were giving him shit.  And not that they should have given Wanda shit at all.  They shouldn't have.  No.  But they shouldn't have given him shit either.  But he's a white guy bashing a liberal.  Right.  And the fucking pussy media kind of takes issue with it.  And that guy is a rock star.  He's a golf analyst.  I always forget his fucking name.  Faraday or something?  Yeah.  And he does, like, the Tiger Woods video game and stuff. 
[01:14:30]  He's a rock star.  And it was in the paper today that he goes over to Iraq every Thanksgiving and hangs out  with the troops and all.  He's a big Bush supporter.  People giving him shit.  And yet, it's amazing how he had to come out and apologize.  And Wanda, again, she should not catch it.  She didn't do anything wrong.  But neither did this guy.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to get into it next after the break.  Speaking of Star Trek, the boys, I believe Derek and Steve, put this little thing together.  Coming up on the next Butt Trek, the USS Prolapse continues its journey through the universe 
[01:15:00]  in search of giant cocks to fuck.  But the crew members soon find themselves in a compromising position.  Oh, my.  Why is there nothing between their legs?  It's silly.  There should be something there.  Why would these people be walking around?  They must be alien race.  Mr. Chekhov is unclipped.  I noticed that at the urinal.  I sure would like to suck it.  Join our heroes as they unravel the mystery of this strange new life form. 
[01:15:30]  They all seem to be lacking something that I enjoy.  Cocks.  And struggle with the dangers of traveling through the universe.  Oh, tell me!  There's a gerbil stuck in my hiding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Where did your cock go?  Discover the fate of our fearless heroes.  All on the next Butt Trek.  Power up the ships, Captain!  I'd like a dick in my backside!  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[01:16:00]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and we were able to get a microphone into one of the Opie and  Anthony Show staff's super secret prep meetings.  Things quickly got heated between Sam and Danny, who were discussing different show-related  creative ideas.  The adamantium that Wolverine has is outside of his bones.  It's an exoskeleton.  No.  Because an exoskeleton is something that's, it's protection that's outside your body.  So you'd wear your, it's when you'd wear your skeleton as your skin. 
[01:16:30]  What about the claws, then?  The claws are retractable.  I still define them as being part of an endoskeleton.  Why are you so stupid?  You're stupid!  I'm calling Big Kev!  Go Big Kev!  With nothing left to do in the Great Wolverine debate, Danny and Sam decided to call ONA's  resident geek culture expert, Big Kev, to help answer their questions.  Wolverine has an adamantium, you know, adamantium on the outside of his bones, right?  Yes.  Is that an exoskeleton or an endoskeleton? 
[01:17:00]  I've always heard it referred to as an exoskeleton.  No!  Fuck that!  That is not true!  Big Kev is not outside his body.  Big Kev is the expert.  He's not outside his body.  I don't know which way to go on that.  All I'm saying is I've always heard it referred to as an exoskeleton.  That is the correct answer, Big Kev.  No, I think Big Kev is saying that he's not quite sure the answer himself.  Big Kev!  I believe, believe it or not, as difficult as it is...  Obviously, the jury is still out on adamantium, but at least we hung up on Kev. 
[01:17:30]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Stick around, we got a woman who found God in her salami.  Yeah.  But first we got Wanda Sykes.  There's a joke there somewhere.  Oh yeah, that's why we threw it out there.  Thank God in my salami.  We'll work on the salami joke. 
[01:18:00]  We're heading into the Wanda Sykes thing really fast, though.  So A-Rod returns, right?  Yep.  No.  This is why people hate him.  He hits a home run on the first pitch he sees coming back from...  Really?  This is why people hate him.  Obviously, he wasn't thinking it was October.  Yeah.  He knew the month.  Everyone's hoping he would strike out.  Strike out so bad he throws his back out or something. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Hits a home run on his first pitch that he sees.  Wow.  Yeah.  Speaking of baseball, on these computers over here, I don't know why it's up, but maybe  the other show is using these computers as well.  Baba Bui from Howard's show threw out the first pitch at the Mets game.  Did you see this yet on YouTube?  Did he?  No way.  And we see him walking around the halls.  I got to ask him if he was doing this as a goof or is he that bad at throwing? 
[01:19:00]  Oh no.  Have you seen this yet?  No, I haven't.  I'll turn everyone on to the clip on YouTube.  I saw him walking in this morning and just missed the elevator.  No, really?  I kind of did it on purpose.  I don't need the small talk chatty thing.  Oh my God.  That is horrible.  What did he do?  He had to.  Can you go back?  Let me see that.  So Baba Bui throws out the first pitch over the weekend at, I call it the New Shea Stadium.  It went so far high and right, but there was no like, there was nothing to the pitch. 
[01:19:30]  He didn't come close to.  God, what a fool.  Huh?  What a fool.  He hit like the cameraman or something.  He let go of the pitch.  I mean, extremely early.  Bob Dahl could have thrown that better.  That's got to be a little nerve wracking.  How the fuck can, how do you choke like that?  Wow. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, that was a choke.  How did they get there and check it out?  You could tell he choked because he looks down and then he goes, he bends over and goes,  I fucking look like an idiot.  And that's, that's now all over the news and everything else.  Oh man.  Wow.  He has.  That's hysterical.  Well, what's the, what's the link there?  I mean, just YouTube, uh, like Gary DeLabate, uh, Mets pitch.  All right.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  You guys know how to find shit.  You don't need my help. 
[01:20:30]  Something to check out.  And then, uh, speaking of the Mets, seven in a row, right?  Damn.  First place, huh?  I guess.  And, uh, how the Yankees doing?  I don't, the Yankees are middle of the pack, right?  Oh, they're doing terrible.  They're sucking ass.  Right.  Are they right around 500 or less than 500?  Last I heard they were less, um, unless they won.  Mm-hmm.  And then I'm embarrassed that I'm not watching, uh, NHL, uh, playoffs, Bruins.  Ah, whatever.  Well, you don't care unless the fucking Islanders are in there.  Well, no.  That ain't gonna happen.  I'll take a peek at some other teams. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  I mean, I would have watched some Flyers games.  I should, I guess, be, uh, pushing for the Penguins, to be honest with you.  The Penguins?  The Penguins, but, uh, I don't know.  I'm just not into it this year.  Uh, yes, Danny.  Oh, yeah.  The Yankees are, uh, 15 and 16.  So they're just under.  They're around 500, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, we got the Wanda audio, and Keith just called me back.  So after we, if you want to play the Wanda audio first, we can get him on the phone, or  if you, I'll give the number, we can get him if you want, because he was at the dinner  with Wanda.  Yeah.  Have him standing by.  Let's start with, uh, chicken noodle soup, too. 
[01:21:30]  Okay.  Why do you want chicken noodle soup?  I just had a hankering for it.  It's 8 in the morning.  Yeah, but why not?  Where are you right now?  About noon?  No, I mean, like, your body clock.  Are you feeling like it's night, lunchtime, breakfast, middle of the night?  I'm feeling like it's later than it is.  Uh, yeah.  Because I woke up before my alarm this morning and got out of bed.  I usually lay there for a little while, but I knew I wasn't going to go back to sleep 
[01:22:00]  because I got to sleep so early last night.  I was, I was done at 9.30.  I was just fucking done.  What time, what time do you get up?  Um, four, uh, four something.  What the fuck was it?  I love how we just counted and tell everybody, yeah, we got up at four.  That's insane.  I know, it's last night.  We're getting up last night to come into work.  But the good news is we get for the next maybe month to month and a half, we actually get  to see daylight as we drive to work.  I haven't seen much daylight driving in.  That's a nice treat.  It's a nice treat for everybody. 
[01:22:30]  I haven't seen much daylight driving in.  But we only get that for like two months.  And then it's back to complete darkness.  Matter of fact, I haven't seen daylight all weekend.  I just fucking, I slept.  You missed a great Saturday.  Vampire.  As far as like.  Was Saturday good?  Ah, it was beautiful.  Weather-wise, wasn't it?  It was like a perfect spring day.  Oh, damn.  Actually, it was a little warmer than us.  It was 68 degrees for me.  AC?  AC was cranking.  I had the blankets on me.  And TV was blasting.  So that was my weather.  Nice.  That was the weather in my room. 
[01:23:00]  You should do a forecast from your room.  Yes.  With about eight minutes of rain during my shower.  This is what Wanda Sykes did at the White House Correspondents Dinner.  Starting with this.  People love you.  You know, and even the media.  You know, you guys have been very favorable towards the president.  You know, it's funny to me that they've never caught you smoking, but they somehow always catch you with your shirt off.  I know you're into this transparency thing, but I don't need to see your nipples. 
[01:23:30]  It doesn't mean it's nipples.  It's taboo.  Is there a beach at Camp David?  What the hell?  Dude, it was never a nipple portrait of Lincoln.  I'm sorry.  Was Obama enjoying this?  Oh, he must have been roaring.  We acknowledge finally that the guy's a square.  Yes.  Everyone thinks he's like this hip black guy, but he's really a square. 
[01:24:00]  Just like all the white politicians.  I think he does like a good joke, though.  He seems like the guy that likes a good joke.  He usually likes throwing one out, a little zinger during some of his speeches.  Off the cuff might say something.  And I don't mean like his speech off the cuff because anything off teleprompter and, ooh, there's trouble.  But, yeah, he kind of likes a joke.  Wouldn't like any of mine.  I mean, they all end with stupid things like, that's how you babysit them.  Jesus.  So, I would just, you know, mums the word on my jokes. 
[01:24:30]  The first black president.  I know you're biracial, but the first black president.  I mean, it's proud.  You're proud to be able to say that.  You know, the first black president.  You know, well, that's unless you screw up.  And then it's going to be, what's up with the half white guy, huh?  We were saying that for a while. 
[01:25:00]  It's funny for her to actually say that to the president.  Yep.  Yeah.  You know, that's been a joke for a while, but that's good.  Can white comics say that same stuff at this thing, Jimmy?  Nope.  But it probably wouldn't even be Obama objecting.  It would probably just be people around getting uncomfortable.  Yeah, yeah.  Swerving in their seats like they have roids.  White people getting uncomfortable.  What is that about?  It's the famous white guilt thing we talk about from time to time.  People are afraid that their racial superiority feelings are going to be obvious if they laugh at certain things. 
[01:25:30]  Or they're afraid that their racism, which is subtle, is transparent if they laugh at things.  Yep.  But that's, and you just hang out.  I think you hang out too much.  Like, what was that?  You and Joe Biden now getting hamburgers.  The two of you kids hang out together?  I mean, whose idea was that?  Nancy Pelosi's?  Hey, why don't you boys go out and get a bite?  Oh, damn. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, that's funny.  Wow.  You know she was a Hillary supporter?  What's wrong with you?  Damn.  I didn't hear that joke.  That's treading a little close to a...  Fucking...  That's a borderline assassination joke.  Yeah, it really is.  Oh, is that...  That really is a borderline Secret Service comes and visits Wanda joke.  Dude, because fucking Nancy Pelosi is third in line for the White House.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys go out and get a company?  All right.  That's pretty good. 
[01:26:30]  And we got Keith...  Oh, and God forbid...  So we got Keith holding on.  Keith, we'll get to you in a second.  Which play do you want to do this?  Yeah, this is the second part of Biden that I was going to go to.  Oh, and God forbid if Joe Biden falls in the hands of terrorists.  God forbid if he's ever a hostile situation.  We're done.  They won't even have to torture him.  All they have to do is go,  How's it going, Joe?  He's come back with stacks of information. 
[01:27:00]  What did you do?  Did you warn him, warn him?  No, I said nice weather.  He's still talking.  I can't listen to him anymore.  It's like torture.  She's killing him.  Yeah, she's killing him.  Is that all we have on her?  No, we got more.  Oh, we got the rest.  Let's get Keith Robinson into the discussion.  Keith was down there, right?  He went with Wanda.  Yeah, man.  I was there.  I was sitting right next to the Fox News table.  It was beautiful.  Oh, Sam.  You helped write a lot of that stuff, right? 
[01:27:30]  Well, no, no, no.  Well, we wrote some stuff, but the guy Lance,  uh, uh, uh, not, yeah, Lance, uh, the brother.  Oh, the guy used to be on, the guy from the Chris Rock show?  Yeah.  Pootie Tang wrote it.  Pootie Tang.  Pootie Tang.  Solite.  Solite wrote it.  So, so what was the feeling in that room, man?  I mean, she was killing, obviously.  Yeah.  Out of the Fox News table, who was laughing the hardest as I kept looking over?  It was Newt Gingrich. 
[01:28:00]  Really?  Yeah.  He really enjoyed it.  He was, he was getting every part of it, you know?  He was, he was, he was getting into it pretty good.  Did you?  It was a good, it was a, it was a great, uh, Obama opened up, which I was a little mad at  because I was supposed to do at least 10 to open up and, uh, he destroyed and then Wanda  just took it home.  Let me ask you something.  You went down there with Wanda, right?  So you guys get there.  What kind of security clearance did you have to go through to get in?  Nothing. 
[01:28:30]  Well, I drove my, my car straight in.  No, nothing.  They were just right, right in.  Nobody did any, nobody checked in.  It was the easiest, uh, and the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  After the, after the, everything was over, it was a nice fist fight right outside.  That's how the security, a full-on fist fight was about an hour.  Wow.  Were a bunch of Obama supporters, were a bunch of Obama supporters beating up a Gingrich supporter? 
[01:29:00]  So, so, Keith, okay, I gotta ask you.  Did you get to meet the president?  Yes, I did.  Fuck.  Get the fuck out of here.  Every black guy is allowed to meet him.  Oh, oh, he, what, Keith, say that again?  I pounded the president up, gave him a nice little handshake and a little, you know, chest  bump.  Really?  It was good.  No, you got to meet him.  I met the first president and his wife.  I met both of them.  Took a picture with him.  What, wow.  What did you, how did you feel meeting him? 
[01:29:30]  Uh, I really felt like a little girl.  Did you?  I tried to be tough as part.  Would he fuck you?  It was really, I'm like, what a woman.  I really, Jim would be happy about this.  I, I'm walking and I see, uh, Samuel Jackson and he's talking to, I didn't know who he was  talking to at first.  Right?  So me and Lance go over and I want to answer my dumb question about a Stevie Wonder, uh,  uh, uh, song that I thought he was at the end of talking about New York, just like I 
[01:30:00]  pictured it living for the city.  And I thought that was Samuel Jackson for a while.  So I elbowed a guy out of the way who he's talking to.  I was like, hey, uh, Sam, uh, now, was that you at the end of, uh, the song with Stevie  Wonder?  He's like, no, I don't even, I didn't even know Stevie then.  He was so disgusted.  I think he wanted to turn into the character from Pulp Fiction and just threw me in.  So he wanted to be.  He had an NBC who I just elbowed after.  Oh, shit. 
[01:30:30]  Good.  You broke into the head of a network's discussion with Samuel Jackson.  To ask him an annoying fucking urban legend that he's probably heard 80 times.  Ha, ha, nice.  He wanted nothing to do with me.  It was the funniest thing.  God damn, if the Secret Service New York passed, they'd have jumped on top of you.  Oh, this is, I know, but it was so funny.  It was good.  It was, it was a good thing, though.  You see, it was, what was great about it is to see people who we look at as big stars  smoothing. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Trying to stay in, because there was a lot of important people there, so they, they had  no time for nobody.  Ludacris was walking around with his little church boy haircut and a suit.  Did you see De Niro there?  No, I didn't see De Niro.  I've seen Tom Cruise.  He was there.  Tom was there, just, you know, he's weird.  Were people taking, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Why do you say he's weird?  He just has a weird vibe about him.  You know, it was, I guess the whole thing is like, it's just like a bunch of mummies, 
[01:31:30]  like people just walking around, because they're so focused on smoothing and getting what they  got to get done.  That is, it's really, nobody's really loose there.  Was anybody taking pictures?  Like with Tom, I heard Tom Cruise was taking photos of people and stuff.  Very, not too much, because he would always act like he was engaged in conversation, an  important conversation, no matter who it was.  A little four-year-old boy, he's down there looking.  He just needed somebody to talk to, to distract from people wanting to take pictures of him. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  He didn't want none.  One guy wanted nothing to do.  I was like, hey, sir, no.  Really?  I loved it.  It was the greatest thing.  Jimmy would have, Norton would have definitely been thrown out.  Yeah, probably would have been.  But the president's there.  The thing is, though, none of them are as big as the, like, the thing is, the star of  the show is Obama, so it's almost like they are all second-class citizens.  De Niro, fucking Tom Cruise, as big as they are. 
[01:32:30]  When it comes to Obama being in the room, they're all the ones who are hoping to get  a picture with him.  Right.  And it's like, it was so funny that Sam Jackson, Tom Cruise, all of them somehow managed to  get to, when the president come in to, you know, we had a little meeting area before,  you know, we went to the dinner.  They all managed to get in proper position to be the first to meet the president.  Like, they knew where it was going to be at.  Like, they asked their publicist or their agents, where is he coming in at? 
[01:33:00]  And they were right there.  Maybe they were told because the president wanted photos with them.  Maybe they said, who's Wanda's driver?  Oh, that's this guy's Keith.  Stick him at the end of the line.  Like, you think that Tom Cruise just figured it out, or maybe they put him there?  No, no, no.  You can see him positioning themselves.  You can see him having fake conversations.  Sure.  Fake conversations.  That is so cool that you picked up that vibe.  How did you feel when he walked in the room?  When he first appeared in the room, you saw him there, in the flesh?  You know what?  I'm such a wimp. 
[01:33:30]  I tell all my boys and neighbors, whatever, it's the president.  I treat everybody the same.  I really was a weak little girl.  Yeah, you were completely starstruck and odd, right?  Yeah, yeah, of course.  He was the president.  And his wife and her long arms came, gave me a nice little handshake.  Her long arms.  Oh, she has long...  Yeah, she's pretty tall, isn't she?  Yeah, she's tall, and, you know, it was good.  It was good.  That was a good, good thing.  And you took a photo with them?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  I got a nice photo, you know, with the prayers.  How does Michelle smell?  You know what?  I didn't want to do nothing wrong, so I didn't even smell a person.  You lean in and just right up to her neck and...  Yeah, I just walked, grabbed that hair and smelled.  Yeah, 20 people pounce on you out of nowhere.  Hey, Keith, you want to send that to the White House?  He'll probably sign it for you.  Oh, yeah, I know.  And scam the face and put it in the FBI computers. 
[01:34:30]  I got to let Wanda take it there for me.  They want nothing to do with me besides Wanda had to introduce me to all of them.  Wanda killed, bro.  Yeah, she did a great set.  Did you get the line where she talked about it was pretty bad, about Rush Limbaugh?  No, we're getting to that.  We played some of the more innocent stuff first, but I got to, as a comedian, I watched her do that.  I'm like, that was absolute balls.  What's great is I'm looking at the clips we're about to play, and she's revving up.  She goes after Sarah Palin, then she goes to McCain, then Limbaugh, Hannity, and then ends with Cheney. 
[01:35:00]  She really started feeling it.  And that's what put the signature on it.  The Rush Limbaugh bit put the comedic signature on it to let her know that she's a real comic.  She just, oh, man, it was beautiful.  Yeah, it really was great.  Can you hang on if we play a couple of these?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, all right, then I wanted to continue with Sarah Palin.  I know Governor Palin, she's not here tonight.  She pulled out at the last minute.  You know, somebody should tell her, that's not how you really practice abstinence. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, shut up.  You're going to be telling that one tomorrow.  Shut up.  God damn.  She really, she did some very ballsy jokes.  You usually try to keep it real safe with those things, but she just fucking balls out, man. 
[01:36:00]  You know, and these things, the states, they need the money.  They need the money, especially our school system.  I'm so happy that you're doing something about education and you want to pay our teachers more.  Because our teachers are grossly underpaid.  That's right.  Pay the teachers more money.  Maybe then they'll stop sleeping with the students.  You'll tell that one, too.  I'm telling you.  See, that's like lines like that.  Like, you'll tell that one Monday morning.  It's like, that's what a veteran comic knows how to do. 
[01:36:30]  It's like when you're making the audience uncomfortable, there's a way to just kind of take that and kick them a little and get a laugh out of it.  Like, that's what a fucking...  Yeah, you had to do it for that.  Dude, it's the press corps.  They're fucking, they're not fun people.  Oh, no.  Follow Washington.  They suck.  Dude, it's everyone important in Washington is there.  Collectively, they're a room full of boars and stiff...  And D.C. and in Hollywood.  That was the funny thing.  Right.  Spielberg was there, Katzenberg.  All these guys was right there. 
[01:37:00]  Did you talk to Spielberg?  All of Hollywood was there and D.C.  I'm going to answer that.  No.  This is why Keith is finished.  Because you walk up to Sam Jackson and ask him a stupid question.  You interrupt the president of NBC, which ruins you there, and you ignore Spielberg.  And you ask Sam Jackson a dumb question.  His past two movies I did not like, so I didn't want to talk to him.  Well, Keith, you can't just wander.  You had to have small talk with somebody.  Who were you having small talk with in that room?  Probably the guy at the bar serving drinks. 
[01:37:30]  We had a hell of a conversation.  He's the only one who wanted anything to do with me because I tipped him.  Did anybody recognize you there?  Oh, really?  No.  Oh, my God.  I just rubbed our back.  I was just going so.  It was funny just to watch how no one wanted nothing to do with me.  It was beautiful.  Wanda continued.  But, Mr. President, you had your fair share of credit, you know. 
[01:38:00]  Even Senator McCain.  Senator McCain gave you grief about the new helicopters that you didn't order.  You know, I think Mr. McCain was just a little bitter because he wanted to be in the new helicopters.  But I'm going to tell Mr. McCain, like, Mr. McCain, I'm sure if you ask nicely, your wife will buy you a helicopter.  Wow.  Funny.  Yes, the rich wife.  Okay.  Finally, the Rush Limbaugh joke.  Yeah, it's a good one.  A lot of people are talking about this morning. 
[01:38:30]  Rush Limbaugh, one of your big, big critics.  Yes, boy, Rush Limbaugh said he hopes this administration fails.  You know, so you said, I hope America fails.  You're like, I don't care about people losing their homes or jobs or soldiers in Iraq.  He just wants the country to fail.  To me, that's treason.  He's not saying anything differently than what Osama bin Laden is saying.  You know, you might want to look into this, sir, because I think maybe Rush Limbaugh was the 20th hijacker,  but he was just so strung out on Oxycontin, he missed his flight.  Oh, my God. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Listen to some of you.  Too much?  Okay, okay.  Wow.  Well, you're laughing inside.  I know you're laughing inside.  Rush Limbaugh, I hope the country fails.  I hope his kidneys fail.  How about that?  She atom-bombed him, man.  She fucking atom-bombed Rush Limbaugh. 
[01:39:30]  Holy shit.  It's good for business.  Rush will have a-  Oh, he'll do a Philip Chilney with that.  A comedian?  I've never listened to this woman before, but I hear she said some things about me that  were not flattering.  Stop.  Fucking fatso.  Dude, did you know she was going to do that line, Keith?  No, no, I've seen her do it before.  I didn't know she was going to do it.  She must have been feeling really good. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you can tell.  She probably had that one in ready reserve, and since it was going so well, she's like,  all right, I'm busting out this fucking, the big heavy bunker buster.  I looked over at the Fox table.  Newt Green Gingrich, once again, was laughing.  She called that one in the huddle, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That wasn't part of the pregame.  That wasn't in the fucking playbook.  That wasn't.  How much time?  Things are going good.  Yeah.  I think that's exactly what she was thinking.  She said, you know what? 
[01:40:30]  I'm going audible here.  Is it going good?  Let's fucking go for the bomb.  We're going right for the end zone.  Keith, how much time?  Because you know what?  Everybody's going to talk about that line.  Yep.  She was front page of the Drudge Report yesterday all day.  It was Obama smiling, and it said Obama laughs at Wanda Sykes joke about Limbaugh.  Front page of the Drudge Report.  And Stephen S. from Bayshore.  I can't do Rush.  You got it up there, Ed?  I don't have instant feedback.  Honestly, I assumed she was a housekeeper in Rush's voice.  Oh, God.  You know he's going to go that route today.  Yeah. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, how much time did she do?  She did about, I guess, maybe 12 minutes.  Oh, okay.  That's not that big.  I thought they did like a half hour.  We got just about her whole son.  No, no, no, no.  No, it wasn't that half hour.  Half hour?  That's fucking...  Oh, my God.  Wow.  You'd really have to be fucking...  You'd have to be Superman up there.  Yeah.  Well, she could do her material, though.  Like, I guess you could probably do a few jokes in there, too.  Like, regular URAC jokes, too, because the crowd wouldn't know.  They just, you know...  How bad would you want to hear Rich Voss in front of the president? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, God.  I get death jam.  Completely unprepared.  So he'd look at him and go, so what do you do, sir?  Yeah, right.  He's trying to work the crowd.  All of a sudden, he's doing crowd work.  I'm the president.  I'm what?  Shut up, dope.  The Secret Service would take his teeth as weapons.  You have to leave his teeth at the door.  Yeah.  You've got to fucking leave these here, sir. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, they think they were like a plastic gun like Malkovich had in fucking the line of fire.  Yeah, he could take his teeth out and snap them together into a weapon.  Yeah, leave those giant choppers at the door.  It's obviously an act.  No one can be that stupid.  He's a smart one.  He's a clever one.  How great was that scene when he's trying to put the gun together under the table?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was just...  I was getting into his head, like, the nerves he's got to be feeling.  Yeah, that was a good one.  And he's got to keep, like, small talk with the table as he's trying to, like... 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, he's snapping that fucking thing together.  Figure out how the gun goes together without looking at it.  Oh, my God.  With the rubber bands and the bike and...  Yeah, that was good.  We've got two more clips from Wanda.  Okay.  Went after Sean Hannity here.  Sean Hannity.  Sean Hannity said he was going to get waterboarded for charity for Armed Forces.  He hasn't done it yet, I see.  You know, he can take a waterboard.  Please.  Yeah, okay, yeah, you make money at waterboard by someone you know or trust, but, you know,  let somebody from Pakistan waterboard, well, Keith Olbermann.  Let Keith Olbermann waterboard him. 
[01:43:00]  You can't take a waterboard.  I can break Sean Hannity just by giving him a middle seat in coach.  God, Wanda.  Fucking hilarious, man.  Bravo, man.  What a ballsy cut.  You're right.  What a great angle on the Sean Hannity waterboarding thing, too.  And that is exactly what, like, a comic does.  Like, when you look at, like, when you watch Chris Rock at the Oscars, he was just fucking  wrecking their day. 
[01:43:30]  You're like, that's what a fucking comic should do.  Like, just be funny.  Almost for, like, beyond the people you're talking to, in a weird way.  Like, be true to what you are as a comic.  I just, I love what she did.  Yeah, I think she represented herself perfectly, and she definitely didn't hold too much back.  Oh, I hate, like, the ideas behind what she's saying, but they're fucking hysterical.  Hilarious.  They're hysterical.  Steven S. is back from Bayshore.  Voss couldn't do his act.  No bombs are allowed in the White House.  And Shane from Philly. 
[01:44:00]  Rich Voss to Obama.  I know the struggle.  I know the struggle.  I know the struggle.  Obama doesn't like to eat the cochi.  What's that?  With that dumb piece on there.  He hits his chest and gives it a piece.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know the struggle.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He hits his chest like he's trying to be urban.  He's a fool.  Just reworking all the Voss material to make it make sense to Obama.  He doesn't eat the cochi unless it's fried.  You know, you know, Mr. Obama, I'll eat the cochi. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, you would just start doing that shit.  Oh, I'm putting that fucking Voss face on.  Oh, his stupid, bugged out eyes.  His little teeny turtle feet, hands would be sweating.  He'll have some kind of tax dodging it.  Oh, God.  He taxed me, but I'm dodging it.  All right, man.  Hey, Keith, where are you this weekend?  I'm at the Comedy Cellar, brother.  Oh, you're down there.  Okay.  Keith is the funniest comic that... 
[01:45:00]  What's that?  ...situations at the Comedy Cellar.  I'm back at the Comedy Cellar.  All right.  Shaking hands with such stars as Jim Norton.  Nice.  Yeah.  Keith Robinson is...  What I belong at.  I was going to say, Keith Robinson, the funniest comic that no one knows.  What are you doing wrong, Keith?  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot, man.  All right, man.  See you later.  It's a very funny Keith Robinson.  We've got to get him back in studio.  I love people's impressions of Keith.  Like, I love...  Someone does them really good.  Is it Patrice?  Someone does a really good fucking impression. 
[01:45:30]  I was giving him a fucking beating the other night.  He was going on after me.  Colin, I think.  So I was just doing his fucking...  His mannerisms on stage.  It was great.  He was in the doorway, and he had to take it.  He just had to take it.  Oh, it was great.  I'm like, watch when he talks.  Every time he talks, he moves like, I'm walking.  And he moves his legs.  It's like, we understand.  We have the commonality of language.  When you say walking, we know what that is.  We know what walking is.  Thank you.  How funny is that?  He fucking met the president.  I'm jealous.  God damn, man.  You know what sucks, though, is being in that situation under those circumstances. 
[01:46:00]  Like, you go to an event like that, you're in there.  You're with the fucking elite of elite.  And then the next day, you're just fucking, you know, you're pissing in your toilet.  You're going to your gig.  You're fucking, you know, doing whatever you're doing.  And you're not with those people, and you can't get near them again.  It's not like Spielberg, who can call a meeting with anyone in that room.  Or Obama, who could fucking, hey, you want to come to the White House?  And they'll let people drop everything.  It's like, hi, you know, I'm Anthony.  Can I fucking, who, what?  We should ask Keith, when did he realize that you weren't, you didn't fit in there. 
[01:46:30]  As soon as he left the building, realized, oh, my God.  You're what amounts to a fucking extra at one of these events.  You're an extra.  Oh, shit.  You get the nice, like, you know, backstage or the VIP classes.  We've all been there.  You get to interrupt fucking people to talk to Samuel Jackson.  And then the next day, you can't get near Samuel Jackson.  And then it's like a Cinderella thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Back to being a fucking.  All of a sudden, you know, you're cleaning up.  You're special from 8 to midnight.  Yeah.  12.01.  They're like, all right, everyone needs to get out. 
[01:47:00]  Get the fuck out.  Unless you have the special blue gold pass.  Yeah.  You're no longer needed.  That does suck, huh?  Then you're fighting for a cab on the streets of New York.  Yeah.  Hey, one more from Wanda Sykes.  Dick Cheney.  Dick Cheney.  Oh, my God.  He's a scary man.  It scares me to death.  I tell my kids, I say, look, if two cars pull up and one has a stranger and the other car has Dick Cheney, you get in the car with the stranger.  Dick Cheney is trying to defend torture. 
[01:47:30]  He's trying to defend torture.  He goes, yeah, well, they should release the memos to show all that good information we got from our practices.  You can't defend torture.  That's like me robbing a bank and then going in front of the judge and saying, yes, your honor, I robbed a bank, but look at all these bills I paid. 
[01:48:00]  Jeez.  Yeah, she did a good job.  Yes, she did.  I give it to her.  Right on to Wanda.  I'm not even a big Wanda Sykes fan, to tell you the truth.  Really?  I'm really not.  Yeah, I'm getting more and more into her.  She's kind of not.  She was pretty funny on Curb.  Do you guys look at the new upgrade for a 3-0?  When does the 3-0 come out for the Apple iPhone?  Danny?  I think that's July-ish.  Is it July-ish? 
[01:48:30]  All right.  Looking very forward to it.  Should be cool.  Thanks.  Absolutely.  Want to hear what the president sounded like?  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Now, who wrote for the president?  I don't know if everyone knows out there.  Rich Vox.  I'm sure a bunch of you know, but this is all written for him.  Yeah, of course.  Every single, I mean, every single line you're about to hear, except for maybe the, I want  to welcome everyone, was written for Obama.  It'd be great if he threw it away and just went, I'm winging it tonight.  And then the news-  And just was horrid, hack, or just bombed horribly. 
[01:49:00]  Hack would be okay, but bombing would be bad.  Yeah, bombing.  And who, I mean, who is the writer that's sitting at his house right now going, that's all  my fucking material and no one knows?  That's going to be frustrating if you're a writer.  Yeah, but I guess these guys are so, a lot of these writers are really prolific, man.  Like, these guys, I know that, let's just say my manager knows certain people who have  written speeches, I believe, both for Bush and Obama, or both for Republicans and, like,  they write for both.  It doesn't matter.  They're just good writers.  Um, and they kind of get, I guess they get what the, what the, the gist of the speech 
[01:49:30]  has to be.  Yeah.  And they write it.  So yeah, it could be any, it probably was, I'm going to guess he had writers from some,  whether it was Leno or Letterman or one of those type shows.  Really?  Probably guys who are used to writing tie-in, topical, daily, clean shit.  You think our pals from Letterman had a little hand in this?  I don't know.  I mean, whoever they contacted, it might have been them, whoever's got a history of it.  I bet you the guy from Leno did.  I bet you the Letterman guys know exactly who wrote for Obama, because, you know, they're  in that circle, talking amongst, among themselves.  I would love to know. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  I would love to know who wrote Obama's material.  Justin and Erica, maybe they, maybe they know.  They listen.  I'll write them during the break.  Here's Obama.  I would like to welcome you all to the 10-day anniversary of my first 100 days.  I am Barack Obama.  Most of you covered me.  All of you voted for me.  Apologies to the Fox table. 
[01:50:30]  I have to confess, I really did not want to be here tonight, but I knew I had to come.  Just one more problem that I've inherited from George W. Bush.  Why does he have to, I don't really get that line.  I don't know either, but he almost tripped on it.  Bruce, it is weird.  I don't get that line.  Another problem to inherit from.  What?  I mean, the presidents have been.  I guess Bush went to, yeah, all these things and kind of. 
[01:51:00]  But the president's been doing the correspondence dinner forever, right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Didn't Lincoln tell a few jokes?  Do you think it's, hey, I had to show up because Bush did, like, really well at these  things?  Maybe it was a little inside for the correspondence dinner.  Maybe we're overanalyzing just a joke that was an inherited problem from Bush joke.  Maybe.  We're looking for the socioeconomic implications of it.  It's just a joke.  It didn't mean much.  Here comes little Nicky.  I can't get enough of this guy. 
[01:51:30]  He arrives around this time every morning.  Oh, my God.  Dude, he, it's, it's uncanny.  Need a picture of him.  I think he knows, too.  Little Nicky.  Little Nicky.  I'm walking down the hallway.  Oh, my father is Satan.  What does little Nicky do for a serious sex animal?  I don't even know who his real name is.  That's the same guy.  Dude, why would he purposely walk around looking like little Nicky?  Tomorrow I'll get him on video.  Oh, you got him.  Little Nicky.  Little Nicky. 
[01:52:00]  He's definitely going for the little Nicky look.  I love it.  Yeah.  I was, Abraham Lincoln, you think?  He might have had a few slave jokes back in the day at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.  Correspondents' Dinner.  And then I woke up and said, I freed who?  But, you know, folks, I need this job like I need a hole right behind my ear.  Here's more Obama. 
[01:52:30]  Hasn't she been an outstanding first lady?  What were they supposed to say?  No!  No, bitch.  That's like, that's like, give yourself a hand.  Yeah, yeah, give yourselves a hand.  You've been great.  Are you ready to party?  I've sucked.  All the lines we've all done to get the crowd going.  She's even begun to bridge the differences that have divided us for so long, 
[01:53:00]  because no matter which party you belong to,  we can all agree that Michelle has the right to bear arms.  Bear arms.  She had like a sleeveless.  Of course, she always has a sleeveless.  Oh, that should have got a boob, by the way.  She never would.  That should have got a walkout by 2,000 people.  Yes.  That's a bad joke right there.  That should have got a boob.  Bear arms.  A big boob.  Yeah.  Real funny.  Funny joke.  Don't get me started.  Can we play that joke again, maybe, if Homer's watching it?  I don't know.  We'll just say, maybe. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, exactly.  As long as Dom DeLuise isn't.  Oh, really?  Oh, Steve from Bayshore just went, oh, boomer.  Oh, boomer.  Gets a little leeway, I guess, because he's the president.  Of course, he does.  If we told that joke on the show, oh, boy.  Why don't I get it to the part?  I don't even know.  Oh, don't be fresh.  All this just to hear boo by Homer?  Dude, this is my favorite clip anyone's ever played anywhere.  For so long, because no matter which party you belong to, we can all agree that Michelle 
[01:54:00]  has the right to bear arms.  Boo!  Now, Sasha and Maria aren't here tonight because they're grounded.  Ah?  What?  Why?  You can't just take Air Force One on a joyride to Manhattan.  Boo!  I don't care whose kids you are.  Ooh.  We've been setting some ground rules there. 
[01:54:30]  By the way, can you pause that?  I'm going to show you what a...  We're starting to get a little carried away.  He can't tell a joke.  Bush was a funnier guy than he is.  Bush could tell a joke.  You're right.  Bush, last year, he had comedic timing.  Obama feels really awkward trying to do humor.  He's not a funny guy.  He's like, he pointed out that he goes, they can't just take the Air Force One on a flight  to Manhattan.  I don't care whose kids you are. 
[01:55:00]  It's like, you talk after the punchline.  You know what he is?  He's delivering his funny lines like he does a speech.  Like he does his speeches.  It's the same thing.  We need to get the banking industry back in order.  And his jokes are, they can't just take Air Force One out for a joyride.  It's like, the guy's got no timing.  And the setup on that stunk.  Because he should have said they're grounded.  They're punished.  We had to show them that I don't care whose kid you are. 
[01:55:30]  You cannot take Air Force One out on a joyride around Manhattan.  That's the punchline.  That's the punchline.  You don't go...  It's not an incidental thought.  The point is not, I don't care whose kid they are.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Once you say they took the plane on a joyride, the joke's over.  It's over.  It's done.  That's the funny part.  And it's a huge...  And then...  It's a huge stretch, too, because the kids are...  Joke's got to be sort of believable.  You know what I mean?  Sort of believable?  They're like just little tiny little nobody.  The thing is, you know, some kids do take cars on joyrides and shit like that. 
[01:56:00]  So, I guess it's kind of funny...  He just wanted to fit in that Air Force One joke.  Yeah, yeah.  He probably should have said...  He probably should have used Biden.  That Biden took the Air Force One out on a joyride over Manhattan.  Yes.  Because Biden's that loose cannon in the administration.  He did have a funny Biden line.  Do you have it or no?  I don't know.  Let's find out.  Michael Steele is in the house tonight.  Who the fuck's Michael Steele?  I don't know.  Anyone know who Michael Steele is?  Porn star.  Oh, all right. 
[01:56:30]  Or, as he would say, in the heezy.  Um...  Oof.  Boo!  Wow.  Wowie kazowie.  Be more funny!  Oh, shit.  That kind of worked.  Shoot.  Okay.  Please do we hear more.  Oh. 
[01:57:00]  He's, um...  He didn't go there.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  This is going great!  Can I do it?  After his next joke, you should.  The other one?  Oh, yeah.  The?  Oh, yeah.  You sure?  Yes.  Well, this is not something from Blazing Saddles.  That's what I'm saying.  That's where I was going.  Oh, no.  What?  What?  What?  Um...  What? 
[01:57:30]  That's...  Yes, that's...  Oh, that's not from that.  But that might be from Blazing...  Okay.  Is it from Blazing or Cannon?  I don't know.  I think Cannonball...  No, it's History of the World.  History of the World.  Oh, so you were with me the whole time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  History of the World, that's right.  What I was saying is the Blazing Saddles quotes we have.  Yeah, because Dom was in Blazing Saddles, and I wasn't sure if that line was from there,  because I don't really remember what...  No, it was from History of the World.  Oh, all right.  Gentlemen, please rest your sphincters.  Now, that's Blazing.  Oh, all right.  You were on the same page all the time. 
[01:58:00]  What's up?  What's up?  He's doing a what's up?  He did a what's up.  Because that's safe black humor, I guess.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Because Whitey accepted that a long time ago.  Eddie, money's already here?  How do you not love that?  He's an hour early.  He's an hour early.  Holy shit.  All right, we'll get Eddie Money in in a few minutes.  What the fuck? 
[01:58:30]  Where's Michael?  Michael, for the last time, the Republican Party does not qualify for a bailout.  Rush Limbaugh does not count as a troubled asset.  I'm sorry.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Why did the applause drastically go up? 
[01:59:00]  Was that a bad edit?  I don't know.  No, I think they just, anytime he's talking about Rush.  They love it.  They do love it.  Let's go to Gabe.  Black guy for this discussion, I guess, from Jersey.  Gabe, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Yeah, you know, I just had a little comment.  I think you guys should, like, stop riding him so much.  Like, he's not a comedian.  Like, he's not supposed to make it.  All right, we won't ride him.  Get out of here.  We can ride him all we want.  Yeah, we're just making fun of the jokes the president told.  We know he's not a comedian.  That's the fun of playing a boo after the, uh... 
[01:59:30]  What, are we supposed to not say that he really has an awful delivery on these jokes?  We don't bring it up because, what, we'd be giving him a hard time?  Why?  What's the difference?  What if it was doing Bush?  I don't know, man.  Like, I'd like to see you do his awful one day.  I do it every fucking day.  That's my job, is to say semi-funny stuff.  What, jokes would be a president?  Yeah, I could do that.  Gabe, the point is, I wasn't... 
[02:00:00]  I'm more of a fan of Obama than Bush, and I openly said Bush just was funnier.  He was a funnier guy.  Yeah.  Dude, when you tell jokes, you open yourself up to be made fun of.  Like, what do you...  Why would you even think of this?  I am so distracted.  Fox 5 in New York, they're doing a thing called The Real Housewives of New Jersey, and they're  showing this one housewife over and over.  She's on the bench working on her tries, and she's bent all the way over just showing  massive cleavage, and then she's, like, hanging, doing her ab work. 
[02:00:30]  Holy shit.  That looks pretty good.  That looks pretty good.  When are they doing the story?  Because they just keep doing the...  Oh, they'll tease that all fucking day, is what they'll do.  Gabe, it's all good.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right, man.  Just get one more clip from Obama at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.  All this change hasn't been easy.  Change never is.  So, I've cut the tension by bringing a new friend to the White House.  He's warm, he's cuddly, loyal, enthusiastic. 
[02:01:00]  You just have to keep him on a tight leash.  Biden.  Every once in a while, he goes charging off in the wrong direction and gets himself into  trouble.  But enough about Joe Biden.  Saw that one.  Come on.  Wow.  Everyone did.  Holy shit.  Like, you didn't really have to sell it as much as you did there.  No.  That thing was on the fucking radar.  Oh, my God.  Put him up without Joe.  Oh, Jesus.  Who's he going to say? 
[02:01:30]  He's talking about the dog.  Oh, Joe.  Joe.  Oh.  Wow.  I didn't see that coming.  I think there, everyone's thinking Joe.  So, if he went somewhere else, then you get, I don't know, whatever.  What he should have said is, that's right, my new dog, whatever.  And then when nobody laughed, he should have said, what would you expect?  Who did you think I was going to say?  Joe Biden?  He should have done that and thrown him a curveball.  Right.  Where did he get his fucking jokes from?  Longsetups.com?  Jesus, Barack.  Shorten them a little bit.  You know, maybe the person that wrote this material doesn't want people to know. 
[02:02:00]  Because I don't think Obama pulled it off as well as he put off.  Michael Steele, Ant.  You should have known who Michael Steele was.  Yeah.  Who was he?  The Republican Party.  Oh, okay.  I guess.  I don't know.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  Sorry, I went for the joke and said porn star because it sounds like a porn star name.  Yeah, he's a black.  He's a black.  Michael Steele.  Michael Steele.  And I guess he's a nerd.  Yes.  A nerd.  According to that caller.  I'm not a prude.  I'm not a nerd.  Remember her?  Lingo Longer.  Sure. 
[02:02:30]  I got to pee.  Yeah, let's pee.  Make a pee.  Eddie Money?  Yeah.  And then Eddie Money.  Is Eddie Money going to play for us today?  He's a guitarist, I think, right?  Did he bring a guitar, Danny?  Can someone do some reconnaissance?  Find out what Eddie Money's about today.  Yeah.  A little recap.  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Hey, you're checking out Opie and Anthony for a Monday.  Monday.  Monday.  We got Eddie Money going to start taking the long walk down the hall. 
[02:03:00]  Lunes.  Eddie Money's a Long Island dude.  Two tickets to Paradise.  The musical at the Dix Hills Performing Arts Center in Dix Hills, New York.  June 4th through the 7th.  And then June 11th through the 24th.  Oh, boy.  We got to help him out with his website, though.  DHPAC.org for tickets and information.  What?  Eddie has tour dates listed from now until October at eddiemoney.com.  Walking down the hall. 
[02:03:30]  What's the matter, Iraq?  Problem?  Iraq.  You should have started them walking at 845.  What's wrong, Iraq?  We go to walk Eddie in.  And then I said, Steve, they're yelling they want him in.  Well, go back and make sure that they want him on the air.  I'm like, they're on the air now.  Well, go and ask and make sure that they really want him in the studio.  Of course we do.  We're playing his song.  If you hear his song, that means get the guest in here.  Holy Jesus.  Eddie Money, everybody.  There he is.  How you doing, man?  We're disorganized right now, Mr. Money.  BAB boy. 
[02:04:00]  How are you, sir?  A BAB boy.  A BAB boy.  Thanks.  God, you know all about Long Island.  Oh, man.  You want the comfy chair or you want to sit at the big boy's table?  Sit next to the lovely and talented.  My hair cup.  The probation officer loves it.  What do you think?  Jimmy.  Hello.  Hey.  There you go.  Jim.  How the fuck do you still have all your hair?  I don't know, man.  I got lucky.  It's one of those lucky rock guys.  You got all your hair, too?  There you go.  He went hair plugs.  I didn't know plugs.  And I'm heading in that direction. 
[02:04:30]  You fucking idiot.  I never went plugs.  What I did was I got individual follicles placed artistically in the direction the hair grows.  There you go.  Now, plugs are huge plugs that people did back in the 80s that looked like crap.  It looks like doll hair.  This just filled in thinning areas.  Good.  Eddie's got my hair from like seven years ago.  Rock and roll.  I used to grow like that.  I can't grow like that anymore, Eddie.  Like take Propecia, whatever it is.  Oh, there you go.  You do a little of that?  It's one of the many pills I got to take.  Is that it?  What else are you taking?  What am I taking? 
[02:05:00]  Zimbuset?  What am I taking?  What the hell is that?  Zimbuset?  I don't know what it is.  What's it do?  Someone tells you to take it.  You just take it.  I don't know.  I don't know.  You just take it.  It keeps you going.  Keeps me running.  I heard you were talking to the TV in our office.  That's good.  What?  You were like flirting with Linda Schmidt?  Hey, when you get a little older, the chicks that look a little older.  I promised my wife I wasn't going to say chicks on the radio.  Chicks.  She's very liberated.  Yes, the older lady on the TV was...  You like the weather girl?  Swing, swing.  Yeah.  She's all right, I guess. 
[02:05:30]  Everybody's talking about how bad the Yankees are.  Everybody, Yankee, Yankee.  Everybody bitching and moaning and whining in New York.  My Yankees.  My Yankees.  Yeah, that's what's kind of happening because they do suck at this point.  Because you Yankee fans expect a lot from this.  I'm not a Yankee fan.  My father was...  No, I like the Mets, man.  Yeah, you're a Long Island guy.  Yeah, right.  Seven games in a row, Eddie.  Yeah.  First place, Eddie.  I want to get out there.  You haven't been there yet?  No.  No, you got $10,000 for a seat, apparently.  That's a lot of money.  It's ridiculous.  The Yankees are drawing 40%. 
[02:06:00]  When I sing a Star-Spangled Banner, they let me in for nothing.  Is that what you got to do?  Sing for your...  I did it out in L.A., and I did it.  I was warming up in the shed, and then I did it, and I got a little nervous when I did it.  And I got out there, and I said to the guy, the groundskeeper,  how'd I do out there?  Man, you sounded pretty good in the shed.  Oh, shit.  Ooh.  Not a good sign.  That's a tough one.  Let it out for free!  That's a tough one.  You got to start real low.  It's three octaves, too.  Yeah.  And you warm it up, and you warm it up. 
[02:06:30]  If you get out there and you start it too high, you're really in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  You start it too high.  But if you start it too low, you sound like, you know, Jim Neighbors.  You belt out, Oh, My Papa.  That was a good fucking Jim Neighbors tune.  Everyone says it's a really hard song to sing.  It is.  It is.  Why?  Just because it's...  I'd rather do America the Beautiful.  All beautiful, but, you know, nobody wants to hear that.  Well, because when you get to the land of the free, that is a high fucking part of that song.  Yeah, but you know what?  The hard note is actually Rockets Red Glare.  Oh, right, right.  If you hit the G-L-A-R, it calls you your throat up. 
[02:07:00]  Free is like, free!  Ease are easier.  Yeah, ease, ease are easier.  Rockets Red Glare.  They don't know the song.  Yeah.  And the Rockets Red Glare!  Take Glare out, it's easier to hit.  That's all you change as far as that song goes.  That's your vocal lesson for the day, guys.  You know, Eddie, you've got a lot of fans here.  Yeah, I tell you, I'm very happy with...  For real, man.  You know, I think the play's going to be great.  Yeah.  You know, because back in 68, I moved to...  I quit the police department.  My father was Patronman of the Year, and my brother was in Vietnam at the time, which 
[02:07:30]  was pretty crazy.  And then he came back.  If I wasn't two steps faster than him growing up, I don't think I'd be alive today.  You would have been...  You know, and he retired as an inspector.  How long were you cop for?  I was on the police department two years.  Can I see some idea?  You hold it a lot.  Yes.  You hold it a lot.  I'm not going to stick myself, am I?  Did you see some shit in those two years?  Not really?  I worked on the police department.  It was very dangerous, but it was great.  I was an undercover typist.  I took typing in high school because I got thrown out of shop class. 
[02:08:00]  I was making the same salad bowl for three years.  And, you know, all the shop teachers, they had all the pressure points where they hit you.  They can't do that anymore.  How do you squeeze it?  They were brilliant as far as really hurting you.  And now you would just, you know, instantly just call your lawyer.  Back in those days, I was the only guy in the class that was typing.  You know, me and my guitar player who could throw another shop, too.  And when I went on the police department, they said, can anybody type?  And I looked around and I said, I can type.  So I wound up typing the roll calls, working eight to four. 
[02:08:30]  I'm kidding.  You know, just gravy and the band stayed together.  And then everybody moved out to California.  And so I quit the police department.  I had it.  My hair was getting really good in the back.  This is the real-life New Jersey housewife.  Oh, we were just looking at these, huh?  Yeah, she, her little video package before this was...  Eddie, we get very distracted by having this many TVs in the room.  Yeah, we have eight TVs.  You guys have got to get out a little more.  We really do just get very distracted by televisions. 
[02:09:00]  Well, her tits are shaking there, Eddie.  Come on.  That's why it was never hit on AM radios, because it said that.  You know, I was a punk and a wise guy.  I think that's now.  I just shake it.  Well, it kept me off the charts.  It's a great fucking line.  It didn't keep the same for people from knowing the song, though.  Yeah.  Come on.  It was a great line.  It was very childish.  And we were able to play that.  We were able to play that.  I was a sophomore, I guess, my mother was.  Are they allowed to play that song on regular radio now?  When I first started radio, we cranked up the tit part.  But who knows?  Oh, did you? 
[02:09:30]  What a rebel.  Well, I was like, listen to the words.  Right here, right here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How far is Dick Sills, by the way, from where we are now?  Dick Sills is actually 50 on the LIE.  It's right outside Huntington.  Oh, okay.  It's just a little rich college.  But the people are really nice to you.  Where are you from on Long Island, Eddie?  I'm actually from Plain Edge, Levitown.  Levitown, Levitown, baby.  Levitown.  Yeah.  Governors, come on.  That's what I know about Levitown.  My probation officer came to the show.  Tri-County Flea Market.  My probation officer came to the show.  We'll just flirt out things that are there.  You really have a probation?  I said, you know, I'm looking for some clean urine. 
[02:10:00]  My blood type is weak.  Can anybody help me out here?  Are you really on probation?  No, that's just years ago.  Okay.  He's got some jokes.  And he's got some jokes in them there, Jimmy.  What made you want to do a play?  It's about your life, right?  Right.  And what made you want to do it?  Or did you always want to do it?  Well, I talked about it for two years.  And people always ask me, how did you OD?  Oh, actually, it was called Phenitol.  Phenitol, the guy that invented it, is in jail with like 30 young people all over the  country.  I wouldn't say young since it happened so young ago.  30 grandmas and grandpas, 30 years ago, OD'd on this stuff.  And the guy's in jail for life. 
[02:10:30]  It was Phenitol.  It was a bathtub obituate.  And I was doing some powder and drinking a lot of booze.  And I did this Phenitol.  And it went out like a light.  Went into a countertonic state and blew the sciatic nerve of my left leg.  Blew out my kidneys.  Jesus.  People said, how did you OD?  I said, hey, it was free.  How did you take that?  Did you inject it or smoke it?  No, I never stuck a needle in my arm all my life.  You know, you can't even give me a polio shot.  I'm all petrified in needles.  No, I just snorted it.  Like I snort everything else.  Wow.  True.  Why'd that fuck your leg up? 
[02:11:00]  Because I went into a catatonic state.  My nerves weren't twitching.  When your nerves don't twitch in your body, if you're going through something where you  get so out there that your nerves don't twitch, then your nerve dies.  So I killed the sciatic nerve in my left leg.  Wow.  At least you can't get that sciatica.  Sciatica.  There's no way to get a pain down your fucking leg.  Doesn't that mess your back up, too?  Look.  Yeah, I guess it messes everything up.  But I've been pretty lucky.  I'm pretty good.  I walk through a lot of airports.  I get a lot of exercise.  What's your poison nowadays?  I don't do much of anything anymore. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Just kind of mellow out a little bit.  I hear you.  Cialis is my new drug.  Oh, dude, it's the second greatest.  Which one do you like?  The daily or the three-day dose?  It's pretty hard to fall asleep with the kickstand down, though.  I hope the wife's up.  You know, jeez.  Do you take the daily or the three-day dose?  There's a new daily one.  Three-day dose?  What are you kidding me?  The regular one lasts for three days.  I'm not a rabbit.  Three days?  What is a three-day?  It just lasts for three days, and all of a sudden...  And you don't have a raging heart on for three days?  No, no, no, no.  But your dick is ready.  It's almost like it puts your dick in the starting gate for three days. 
[02:12:00]  Okay.  You're pumped up.  You're ready.  If something touches it, brushes against it.  Any type of incidental contact, and you're ready to fuck.  Anything.  If somebody sticks you in the neck with an umbrella, your dick is hard.  Fucking great.  It sounds like something you would like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you got to take Cialis and Viagra is bad, because Viagra gives you blue streaks,  and it makes you stuffy.  Cialis is the best of all of them.  Yeah, it didn't give me the headaches for any of that stuff.  No, I never got a headache.  I was just pretty good at them.  Just fucking.  What's that?  How about just fucking? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah, but then you got to take a pill off right back, a half-hour time.  No, I mean, how about just...  Yeah, but how about just...  Going to bed, having a chick that you actually find attractive and fucking...  Well, what do we got?  Eddie Money Supplemental.  Supplemental?  We just were handed an Eddie Money Supplemental.  What does that mean?  Supplemental.  I guess more information than we were given originally.  I don't think I've ever looked at a bio sheet.  You know what?  We might have to look at this one, though.  It has a 7,000-square-foot house in L.A., but is sleeping in a sister's basement on an air mattress. 
[02:13:00]  Well, actually, because I'm a Long Island.  You know, from New York, everybody in New York's got a little Jew in them.  Come on.  I mean, why the hell should I pay to stay in a hotel?  But I'm staying in my sister's basement.  My brother-in-law is Italian.  Oh, you live in L.A., but you're back...  I'm back in New York working on the play.  Yeah, you're doing this...  Okay, I got you.  So you're saying real money, so you're in your sister's basement on an air mattress.  Right.  And the air mattress goes out like every other day.  She's on...  She bought it at Walgreens.  She's going on her fourth mattress.  Oh, those things never work.  They never.  It's terrible.  You end up with your ass on the floor.  So I got to get up in the middle of the night and have a cigarette and blow the mattress back up. 
[02:13:30]  A cigarette.  She can't hook you up better than that, Eddie.  Well, if they bought a real bed, you know, they'd have to put it against the wall.  You know, I've read it a thousand times, guys.  I don't want to get into it.  The air mattress is fine.  The air mattress is fine when it's...  Well, it's really not fine.  It's always leaking.  Then you get up and you put your elbow down on it.  Oh, and you're hitting the ground on it.  Then you got to grab the pole in the middle, you know, in the basement of the pole.  Yeah, yeah.  To get the hell up out of the bed.  A little lollipop.  Air mattress, they're made for the young.  They really are. 
[02:14:00]  He's getting off one of those fucking things.  Like, Jesus.  This is a pain in the ass.  So why don't you just stay in a hotel?  Because I got to stay in there because my sister cooks for me and my other sister's down the street.  You know.  Yeah, we do the same thing.  Every time I go out and have a good time, somebody tells me, you know, Eddie was down at Patty's Loft.  Eddie was knocking on the beverage.  I'm going, hey, God, you know.  You can't get, you know, your sisters, they know everything.  You know, since my mother died, it's like nothing's changed.  When we go down to Philly, we stay with the in-laws in a tiny, tiny little bed.  Did you guys ever go down for a real cheesesteak sandwich in Philadelphia? 
[02:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Geno's and Pats.  Geno's.  That's the one.  And Pats, yes.  They spray it on with a paintbrush.  Yes.  I love that stuff.  Really.  I'm obsessed with the cheesesteak now.  The Philly cheesesteak.  Thank God they're so healthy.  Well, actually not, man.  All literal, Jim.  The doctor says you're not getting enough cholesterol.  Yeah, yeah.  Pump that up.  Your blood's flowing too nicely.  Every time I go down, I've got to have one for the ride back to New York.  And it's really that inside Philly.  It's on the outside of Philly, which is crazy to get out there, you know.  Yeah.  How do you know Philly?  We do a lot of shows in Philadelphia. 
[02:15:00]  So you know the whole freaking country.  I've got five kids.  I'll do anything to get out of it.  Favorite place to go when you're on the road?  I like coming back to New York.  That's easy.  I like coming back to New York.  I like playing in L.A. because I get to sleep in my own house.  That's easy, too.  But, I mean, like the country.  You're out in the middle of nowhere.  What's one place, when you see it on your itinerary, you go, right on.  I like this area.  Detroit's good for me.  Detroit?  Yeah.  Really?  That sounds like a scary place.  Bob Seger, Eddie Money kind of town.  You know what I mean?  When did you...  I got a lot of trouble in Detroit.  My wife can't hear this. 
[02:15:30]  So, you know, hey, come on.  Don't worry about it.  She's got friends.  She's sleeping.  It's early.  You're worried about your wife.  No, I'll tell you the truth.  I'm not that worried about it because it's only 6 o'clock in the morning out there.  Yeah.  She's got to get up and get the kids up.  Hey, what was your first really big hit?  What year was that?  I think that was in 1977 or 78.  Was it shaking?  No, actually, it was Baby Hold On To Me.  Oh, Baby Hold On To Me.  Baby Hold On To Me.  And then two tickets.  And what song are I love?  I wrote two tickets to Paradise.  It took me six months to write it, and then I didn't get a record deal, and it took me 
[02:16:00]  two days to write Baby Hold On.  Why six months to write it?  Were you stuck on a chorus?  Well, no, it's just like, you know, I don't know.  It took a long time, you know?  You've got an amazing amount of hits.  That shit happens.  It's like, yeah, some songs just pour out of you.  I like 27 songs in the top 100, I guess.  How many?  I should have saved the money, yeah.  Who knew, huh?  Well, I'm reading the Eddie Money Supplemental.  Supplemental.  It has a lot of young fans because of Take Me Home Tonight, which has been the number  one fraternity song for 10 years.  Wow. 
[02:16:30]  I've got a lot of frat kids at the shows all the time.  I've got a DUI in the way, I'm still here, hey!  Because, I don't know, when I grew up, my father was in World War II, so I grew up with  Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller and all these horrible groups that you would never listen  to.  But now the kids growing up, they grew up with Eddie Money and Sheet Trick and Bob Seeker  and stuff, so a lot of the kids that come to my show, their parents, you know, when  you see like a little kid that's like seven years old singing Take Me Home Tonight, just  because it blows your mind.  That's wild.  You didn't spend it all, did you? 
[02:17:00]  Yes, I did.  Did you really?  Not a problem.  Drugs for a while?  Huh?  Drugs?  No.  Well, yeah, I did drugs, but I never pay for drugs.  Where'd all your money go then?  Well, ex-wives, cars, you know, how many exes?  Two.  Oh!  And you're on your third marriage?  No, this is actually my second year.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you're already, you're already, you're already saved.  I've got to ask you, when did you have the first one, and when did you...  Well, I had the first one during the years of, uh, when I was snorting South American 
[02:17:30]  countries, you know, from about 1980 to about 1987.  So, you know, those are some good Eddie Money years right there.  Oh, it was great.  Oh, man.  And, and of course the lawyer goes, well, you know, she obviously had a lot to do with  his success, and then, how the hell they fucking pull that one out of their asses?  Yeah, you got it.  I'm the one singing, I'm the one fucking on stage gigging, and for some reason now she  gets fucking half of this shit?  Well, I'm sure, I'm worried about my wife, my new wife getting more.  We were, broke up for a while, and she hired Gloria Allred as a lawyer. 
[02:18:00]  It cost me $40,000, and we were reconciled two weeks later.  Wow.  I'm still just paying the interest off that one.  Gloria Allred for $40,000 for two weeks?  Well, this is, my wife said, well, your husband's got to hire your lawyer.  So she hired Gloria Allred, you know?  Yeah.  Who hates men completely.  Mine got Dominic Barbara.  Oh, God, jeez.  Wow.  Yeah.  I feel the pain.  I was fucking, that was...  This would be a hell of a blues singer, let me tell you.  That was nine, nine years ago.  Oh.  Nine years ago. 
[02:18:30]  And I'm just finishing up.  Thank God you got a good book on the radio, huh, guys?  Yeah, yeah.  It's about time we write it, to be honest with you.  Fucking A.  We've been holding back for way too long.  Wait, why does the, uh, why does the husband have to pay, like, that's stipulated, you have  to pay for her lawyer?  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever been divorced like the rest of us?  No, you never.  You're not in the club or what?  What's the matter with you, Jim?  No.  I've been doing shows with Rick Springfield and his wife put him in the can, too.  Oh, shit.  We're in the same club.  I said, we got a lot in common, Rick, you know?  I'm just not a doctor on TV.  How long was he married for? 
[02:19:00]  I have to know where you're at.  I have no idea.  He married for a week and, uh, he had to pay out $16 million.  No, the cop said to me, why'd you throw the phone to your wife?  I said, I was just trying to knock the knife out of her hand.  And then he's got, uh, five kids, Ant.  Yeah.  Five kids.  The only car on the driveway that's paid for is mine.  Really?  How many cars you got in that family?  Uh, listen, my son's got a, uh, he's got a Mustang convertible I bought him.  Nice.  And then my other kid's got a Jeep.  Nice.  And they had the pot dogs smell the pot in the Jeep and they got thrown out of Christian High 
[02:19:30]  School, which saved me $1,700 a week, a month, you know.  And then my daughter sprinkled it in there yourself.  My daughter just got a DUI.  She blew a two, three on New Year's Eve.  Wow.  And kicked the two cop car windows.  And, uh, wait, wait, wait, you can't just, yeah, she's a sweetheart though.  I mean, she's a great little singer.  My daughter.  She opens up for me, right?  Yeah, she opens up for me and, uh, got a lot of young kids coming down to see you.  She's really incredible.  So she got, she blew a two, three.  That's a, that's a really high, man.  A lot of blues, huh, man?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is a lot. 
[02:20:00]  I guess the apple don't fall far from the tree.  With a tequila alarm.  Little Jesse Rehab, come on.  No, she's great though.  I love her.  But it's New Year's Eve too, you know.  It was New Year's Eve.  The numbers are, wow, you, can I, uh, wow.  I don't want any money to punch me, but you got a really hot daughter there, Eddie.  She's very cute.  She's very attractive.  Very attractive.  That's the word you use.  You say, she's very attractive.  Is that the way to get around that ant?  Yeah.  I never saw that picture.  She's very attractive.  Yeah, she looks so good.  And she's in a very pretty dress.  I wish that skirt was a little longer.  I was going to say, do you approve?  I mean, I don't want to be a grandfather quite yet, you know. 
[02:20:30]  No, no.  But she's got a boyfriend from, uh, he's actually in the Coast Guard.  And she got off work early last night.  And there was five cop cars at the hotel.  So I knew that something was going on.  Oh, shit.  She had a big fight with him.  And then she cancels a ticket to get home.  She's ruthless.  She's like, my wife.  She's just ruthless.  Oh, wow.  Really?  She's ruthless.  They had a five cop car fight?  Well, I don't know what happened.  She just, you know, when she goes over to deep end, she goes over to deep end.  I guess so.  Eddie Money sounds like he's in hell. 
[02:21:00]  You sound like you're in hell, Eddie.  Then I got my other son in his third year of junior college.  I can't figure that one out.  I thought it was a two-year school.  Then I got another son of mine that's going to Berklee School of Music.  Just $6,000 for a summer semester.  He's going to go to school for four years, get a degree, and come back and play in a goddamn club band.  Yeah.  What the hell is that all about?  You could just do that.  Why can't he be something else?  Like, you know, a doctor, a lawyer.  Yeah, if you're going to go to school, why not just...  You're going to go to school.  To get in a band, you just fucking get in a band. 
[02:21:30]  I don't know what's going on.  You try to tell him how to play music, and he probably doesn't want to listen because he's your dad, right?  He listens to all these groups that, you know...  Like what?  Sounds like they got an egg beater when they're picking it.  You know, it's like, you know, these little...  Oh, he's going for that.  I don't need your music, dad.  And they don't think I'm that good, so they all think they're going to be stars.  You have...  You got all the hits.  How many hits does anything else you have?  It's like my wife.  She's not a fan, you know?  It's like my wife.  She's not a fan.  Your wife?  Yeah, I'm not a fan.  She's not a fan of what you've done?  Oh, shit. 
[02:22:00]  Well, but, you know, there's a lot of dirty water under that bridge, kid.  Yeah?  You don't want to go there.  I like your song.  It never really did...  It wasn't well on...  It didn't do well on commercial radio, but water?  Cool, cool water?  Give me some water, yeah.  Give me some water.  It's an amazing Eddie Money song if you want to check out something different.  I just cut that with Vince Gill.  We're putting a country record together in Nashville.  I never understood why that didn't go on radio.  Because it was just...  It wasn't really...  In those days, it was like FM was real big in those days.  You know, FM radio.  Right.  You know, W, Scott Muni, all the guys, you know. 
[02:22:30]  And then there was AM radio.  Cousin Brucey!  He's right there.  There's a complete difference, you know.  He's two doors down.  Yeah.  Say hi.  Cousin Brucey.  I love Brucey.  The Brucey man.  Brucey.  What are the original WMCA good guys?  Yeah.  You guys are too young for that.  Were they good?  They were very good.  I don't remember hearing about them.  No, were they good?  Come on.  There was five of them.  B. Mitchell, Reed.  They were boring, right?  No, they weren't boring.  They went on their radio shows with suits and stuff.  Well, you know, in those days.  Come on.  With a time.  I remember hearing...  Everybody looked like a probation officer.  Come on.  Eddie was huge on B.A.B. back when I was... 
[02:23:00]  Like, Buckman was playing, you know, your stuff, like...  Well, I did the secretary.  All the time.  She was very sweet.  Oh, yeah.  Did you really?  No.  Back in the day.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Now I've had a condom on my wallet for ten years.  I'm married.  I heard they make great water balloons.  That's why I got so many kids.  You get the condom impression in your wallet because it's been there too long?  One of those?  We don't want to go there.  Jesus Christ.  I had one of those in high school.  I didn't get much in high school there, Eddie.  So the...  I didn't either. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  When I went to high school, nobody got laid.  Well, Anthony was getting laid at 13.  No, but that was out in California with some fucking...  13, Eddie.  I had a girlfriend in high school for three years, and then I moved to California, and  then she flipped out at a nervous breakdown.  She came out and fucked my roadie.  I couldn't believe it.  Your wife?  No, my ex-girlfriend from high school.  In the farm.  That's fucking bad to fuck you with the roadie.  I bowed to Anthony because, like, for 13, I got a 10-speed bike, for real.  Anthony got a girl.  My dad hooked me up with a friend-of-the-family thing. 
[02:24:00]  So at 13, that was done with.  They said, did you do a son or what?  Yeah, yeah, it was one of those.  So how was it?  Hey, did you do a lot?  How was it there, my boy?  I think she was 19, something like that.  So it was nice.  And then I went to school, and it was great.  School was like, eh, fuck this.  All of a sudden, you're getting rid of your baseball cards.  Sex and pot ruined my education.  The second I started smoking, I was like the kid with the microscope and telescopes, and  I fucking loved science and going to school. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, you were good at all that.  I was really good.  Then you started smoking pot, and then you got into candy bars.  My brother came out to California because I was living with my dad out in California.  You were living with your father out there.  No wonder you're so fucked up.  I'm in California.  Of course.  Believe me.  So my brother comes out, and he got kicked out to see my father because my mother couldn't  handle him anymore.  She was smoking weed all the time.  Went out there, and in the riverbeds out in California, I have that flood control riverbed  shit.  Sure, yeah.  I lived in San Juan Capistrano.  God.  So.  The coach house.  Yeah, yeah.  The coach house.  The Franciscan. 
[02:25:00]  The, yeah.  The swallows come in there every year.  The swallows in.  Right, yeah.  It's a nice bar if you want to go there in Capistrano.  You know, but he used to hide his joints in my Estes model rockets.  I was such a fucking thing.  So I took one one day, and I was like, I just wonder what this is like.  And I heard you didn't get stoned the first time you smoked.  So I went in one of the pump houses in the riverbed, and it was pitch black.  A few little things of light coming through.  I smoked the whole joint.  And I was like, it must have been.  California, right?  Because when I opened the door up, it was like Dorothy going from black and white to 
[02:25:30]  color, and I was just like, oh my God, everything looks different.  My whole point of view on everything changed.  My priorities changed.  It just became, I need to smoke pot all the time.  Right.  And school went right down the shitter.  I tell you, my wife doesn't do any drugs at all, but when I first met her, I got a  loaded on weed, and I had to blow it into her mouth and stuff like that.  I thought I was going to give her a great piece of ass.  I ran down to the candy machine seven times for her. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  I got laid.  I've never had candy so good.  Yeah.  Why is this so goddamn good now?  I've never had her.  She's kissed this well.  Danny just found another picture of your daughter.  What?  She's a very pretty girl.  What are you going to fucking say?  Danny's too scared to put it on the screen for Mr. Money.  Why?  I've never seen any of these.  She's a beautiful girl.  Look at her.  Her face is pretty.  She's got a beautiful picture.  She did that Rock the Cradle.  That's what I remember.  Okay.  I saw that show.  She was really, really good.  She was next to Chloe, who was Olivia Newton-John's daughter. 
[02:26:30]  You know, Chloe was like, Olivia Newton-John was always gone, and she was in house-by-house  self, and she was anorexic.  And everybody who votes for those kids on the show are voting for the kids with the  most problems.  Chloe?  Yeah.  Chloe looked like an alien on that show.  I watched this show, actually.  But my daughter sang her ass off, and she got bumped.  See, political reasons, they bumped her first.  What did she say?  So she turned around and wrecked the dressing room.  That's my little girl.  Did she really?  Fucking A, she did.  Except for the old man.  Are you kidding me?  I was scared of his daughter, man.  What a maniac.  Don't ever bring her around. 
[02:27:00]  The money family is a...  No kidding.  That's something, man.  What is she...  What kind of music?  She likes Janis Joplin.  She's got some really good songs.  She did a great version of I Want to Take You High by Sly and the Family Stone.  Oh, really?  Can we hear that?  And my guitar player is writing songs for her.  Yeah.  And now she's doing...  She did a great version of Turtle Blue.  She loves Janis Joplin.  Mm-hmm.  You know, she loves Janis Joplin.  Does she have that kind of raspy voice?  Yes, she does.  I think that's a lot of soul to it.  She does something kicks ass.  It's incredible, man.  It's probably raspy from screaming at people.  I love this kid.  She got nodules from yelling at various people. 
[02:27:30]  Jesus Christ.  She's beautiful, man.  I had something, Eddie.  Jeez.  Eddie.  I don't think you have to worry.  I think she's had the same work for the last five years.  Yeah.  Of course, they met in continuation school, you know.  Ah, con school.  I went there.  I went there in California.  My daughter was 14 years old, and she's going to summer school.  She goes to summer school.  They found an ounce of pot in her desk.  And I'm like, oh, my God, what's going on?  Then she writes the letter.  Well, I found it in my father's drawer in the guest room.  Oh, great.  Sell you out.  I told you, Ross, kids were going to use drugs because you used drugs. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, God.  But why would you take an ounce with you?  Why not just take enough for the day?  Just a little bit, a little bit.  I have no idea.  My daughter.  Just enough for some one-hitters.  Everything exists.  You didn't teach her right.  Roll a couple of joints.  Put them in somewhere, you know.  I'm going to say them.  Well, thank God those dogs are looking for bombs and not pot on the plane.  Or I wouldn't be here today.  You don't have connections on Long Island?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  Got to bring her from California, baby.  That is true.  It's like after a while, your contacts go away, go to jail, wherever on Long Island. 
[02:28:30]  Actually, I got a buddy in Oregon, which is fantastic.  Your governor out there wants to legalize.  We're getting closer to possibly legalizing the pot.  Schwarzenegger.  Huh?  The state's in such a desperate place.  Well, actually, you get a medical marijuana card.  We've talked about it.  Doug Benson was in here going into the sciatic nerve.  No, I had a medical marijuana card, but now I'm a Floridian.  I got separated, so I moved to Florida.  So I lost my citizenship in California.  Oh, shit.  Now I've got to get arrested with everybody else. 
[02:29:00]  So, wait, you're not with your wife now?  Yeah, well, we're back.  You know, she's great.  I just spent the whole day with her for Mother's Day, bought her a really nice pair of earrings.  And, you know, I'm still crawling back.  You know, she's a gorgeous woman.  She's size zero, number one in the spin class.  She looks amazing.  I think so.  Once you get on the top shelf, it's hard to go for the leftovers for you.  Guy makes the point.  You don't want to go down, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  You don't have to trade down. 
[02:29:30]  Listen, I hear your guitar player is ten minutes away.  We should take a break.  Go ahead, guys.  Continue with Eddie Money.  Hey, you know what?  I want to talk about...  No, I want to talk about GTA.  No, they're loving this, actually.  Are you sure?  I swear to you.  They're like, you need a reality show.  Oh, God, no.  We were going to get a reality show, but my wife said you're famous enough.  Knock it off.  She wasn't into that, you know?  We're going to talk about Grand Theft Auto.  He's got a song in there.  Don't say it now, but I want to get your wife's opinion on GTA.  And you've got everyone covering your songs now, Eddie.  You've got Hinder doing one, and Foo Fighters are doing Baby Hold On. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Then Hinder does take me home tonight.  You know, our own David and Kenny,  they're a wonderful...  I'm a big Rotgut fan, though, baby.  Holy shit.  That's going bad.  I had my cousin who was traumatized when you guys all hung yourself on stage.  Yeah, yeah.  He still has nightmares about it.  He's been in and out of rehabs for years.  Did you guys actually...  Yeah, we had the harness nooses, and we did one whole song just hanging by the neck.  That was the big kid of Long Island for 10 years.  Yeah, I know.  Nobody stopped talking about that.  No, we figured let's just go out there and hang ourselves. 
[02:30:30]  Now we're trying to convince him to do it for real.  Let it be known that Eddie Money knows Anthony.  They were bigger than the rich kids.  It was like...  They were bigger than the rich kids.  Do you know Jim Norton?  It was a bigger...  Do you know Jim?  Jim.  That.  Con comedian.  Jimmy Norton.  I've seen you on television.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's not a good one.  I'm an ex cop.  I never forget a face.  Yeah, yeah.  Ex cop's already got faces.  Do you remember those lips sticking through a glory hole?  Why do you think that I'm the fucking giver and not a receiver through a glory hole?  I don't know.  I don't like how you paint me as a kneeling sub. 
[02:31:00]  Because the doctor told them to take two of these three times a day for the rest of your  fucking life, okay?  Eddie, we got David and Kenny.  They're a duo that sings.  Sure.  And they covered one of your songs.  Fantastic.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, you want to put the headphones on?  Well, I saw my royalties by my wife.  I asked you to be out of here.  Well, that's true.  This is Take Me Home Tonight, their version.  Want to hear it?  I don't want to show.  It's unbelievable.  Here it is.  Oh.  Like karaoke version. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  What the hell?  I feel a hunger.  Oh, my God.  It's a hunger that tries to keep a man awake at night.  Are you the answer?  I shouldn't wonder when I feel you wet my appetite. 
[02:32:00]  With all the power you're releasing, it isn't safe to walk the city streets alone.  Anticipation is running through me.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's find the key and turn this engine on.  I can feel you breathe.  I can feel your heart beat faster.  Take me home tonight.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light. 
[02:32:30]  Take me home tonight.  Oh, my God.  Listen, honey.  Just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby.  And be my little baby.  It's like the gun show.  Where's the gun show?  Where is that hook?  Just like Ronnie sang.  I say, just like Ronnie sang.  Be my little baby.  Oh. 
[02:33:00]  Baby, my darling.  Oh, oh, oh.  I feel a hunger.  It's a hunger.  Take me home tonight.  I don't want to let you go till you see the light.  God, oh, my God.  I shouldn't laugh because my oldest son that can't sing a note, and he would actually try.  He probably sounded just like that.  Wow.  How is that?  He stoned them.  How is that?  Well, it's because my wife had him before I met her. 
[02:33:30]  When I met my wife, she already had Zachary, and he's a good-looking kid.  I said, she's probably a great little baby maker.  And no voice.  No vocal talent.  No, but he's a good-looking kid, and he...  Eddie, we did that for you.  I'm telling you guys, it's the worst version I ever...  It's the worst version I ever heard in my entire life.  It was horrible.  You think so?  All right, we're going to go to break with the Rock Guts song.  What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up?  I want to hear the Rock Guts.  This was our crossover country here.  Rock Guts. 
[02:34:00]  This was our crossover country here.  I don't remember streaming it, though.  You should invite him...  My father's place.  ...to do live at the Comtown.  Yeah, my father's place.  Fucking Baby Huey's, Tooey's.  Right, sure.  Fucking...  Epi's.  Cariola's place.  Frank Cariola.  The black moss ears.  We'd watch the hair coming out of his ears as he told us no one showed up in a full club  and we couldn't get paid, motherfucker.  I know.  Don't you just love those club owners?  Pump your own equipment in and out of the joint for nothing.  How big of an event is you playing now, Eddie? 
[02:34:30]  What are you doing?  I don't know.  We do...  I went out with Rick Springfield and John Waite and Lou Graham and we were doing, you  know, 15,000 people.  That's amazing.  We're going to take a break.  Yeah, sure.  We'll continue with Eddie Money.  They're setting up.  Your guitar player is literally entering the building.  You're going to sing one for us today, Eddie?  Sure, if you want, guys.  Yeah, yeah, definitely, man.  All right, cool.  Well, more with Eddie Money, but first, Rotka doing their big...  It's our crossover country hit, by the way.  This is Naked Cowboy.  Oh, man.  Listen to this, Eddie.  Jesus.  Hey, boy, what you going to be when you grow up?  Oh, I don't know. 
[02:35:00]  I'm a little embarrassed to say.  Why, I said, come on out of your chair.  Nah, well, ever since I was a young, there's the one thing I've always wanted to be.  Why don't you tell us about it?  Well, I want to be a naked cowboy!  Well, I'd rather be in the nude.  I can wear my boots, my cowards with their suits.  It rocks, silver, fuck it, black and blue.  Well, I want to be a naked outlaw.

We're not even lying to you  For Derek to sing with Eddie Money  Is going to freak him the fuck out  Derek is  Without a doubt  One of your biggest fans  Huge fan  We're all fans of yours  But I would say Derek is the biggest  I'm not kidding  We're not fucking playing right now  I tell you  You guys got a great radio show  Wishing nothing but success  What's this?

Oh, yeah, like a strobe kind of 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, a strobe light  And, you know  With the guitar in slow motion  You know  It's fucked up how inventive you got  When you're just kicking around on Long Island  Playing gigs  And you needed to  You needed one step over  Maybe, you know  Exactly  Cintron or something  You know  You wanted to fucking  You didn't have the money for the lights and shit  So you gotta kind of build your own things  Exactly  Blow shit up maybe sometimes  Or hang yourself  You guys are good at hanging yourselves  Now, Derek is staying there awkwardly  You got one question for any money before we excuse you? 
[02:44:30]  Actually, no  He's gonna sing  He's gonna sing  Well, is he standing there?  He's doing  Yeah  Hey, come on  Let's go to work here  Here we go  All right, we'll sing  All right  Well, Derek's gonna sing  To Steve Rodson, everybody  The musical director for the play  You know, the car is part  It's just, you know  We need a guy to do the lead guitar  Rock when I do that  Hey, what part do you want him to sing?  Just the  Here we go  I've got a surprise now  Especially for you  It's something that both of us have always wanted to do 
[02:45:00]  Here we go  You waited so long  You waited so long  You waited so long  You waited so long  I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here  Yankee Stadium ain't got no money  I've got two tickets in my pocket, baby 
[02:45:30]  We're gonna disappear  Cause you waited so long  You waited so long  You waited so long  You waited so long  I've got two tickets to paradise  Packing bags will leave tonight  Two tickets to paradise  Two tickets to paradise 
[02:46:00]  There you go  Did I get the job or what?  Oh my god  That's really good  There you go, Derek  Does the club owner have my number or what?  I thought you sang with Eddie Martin  That's pretty fucking cool, no, Derek?  Yeah, man, totally  I didn't expect that  I sucked, though  Nah, you were alright  Derek was kind of bragging  He's like, I'm good  He'll like me if I can sing it  Well, in the play  I'm on the police department  And the band really hates me 
[02:46:30]  Because I got short hair  And everybody in those days  Long hair was so hip  The Beatles, The Stones, Bob Dylan  And I had short hair  But I was the best singer around  You know, I might have been on the police department  But I was still, you know  I was still, you know, Billy Joel  And it was me  Cause he was making records  And I wasn't, you know  But at the same time  We did this song called  I'm walking home  And it's freezing cold  And the next day  The band's leaving for California  And my hair's getting really long  And my father's wanting me to cut my hair  And he's really, really pissed off  And I'm walking back with Kevin  Who's actually 
[02:47:00]  Still my good buddy  He's in the program  He's kind of boring these days  But he's still one of my best friends  He's on a seven step  Like I give a shit, you know  And we did this song called  California Here I Come  We'll give you a little bit  Alright, here we go  I'm always freezing  What key am I in here, huh?  I'm always freezing  Alright, here we go  I'm sorry  I'm always freezing  Got this cold in this big sweater  There you go  Alright, one, two, three, and  I'm always freezing 
[02:47:30]  Got this cold in this big sweater  In California  No one worries  About the sinking weather  The sun is shining  Golden bodies on the beach  It's not that far away  It's in our grass  It's in our reach  We got the band  We got the look  You know we got it all  You're not a cop  You're born a rock  You're gonna have a ball  Let's go to somewhere  Where the sun is gonna shine  You're like a boy scout  Come on, you ain't really  Fighting crime  Look for you  Here I come 
[02:48:00]  Come on, guys  All the sunshine  All the fun  Get on that plane  We gotta run  California  Here I come  That's a lot of great songs  In the play, though  You'll get a kick out of it  Nice  You're acting in the play?  I'm actually narrating it  Which is a lot easier than that  I saw Jersey Boys  And it was so cool 
[02:48:30]  And at Jersey Boys  I met Frankie Valli  We did a TV show together  Which always lasts  Two or three days  You know how TV shows  Are in Los Angeles  So I got pretty  We got to talk  And stuff like that  I saw Jersey Boys  And at Jersey Boys  His daughter  Old D's and D's  And looking at Jersey Boys  And at the four seasons  It reminded me so much  Of my first band  The Grapes Are Rare  And I had a bad  Major overdose  But I lived  And I wrote that album  No Control  About the overdose  Well, they took me to the hospital  You know, Control  And stuff like that  So I decided to put  The whole play together  And actually 
[02:49:00]  The Two Ticks of Paradise  Is a lot like Jersey Boys  Because Jersey Boys  Made $250 million  In two years  And I'll be lucky  You know, I don't know  How I'm going to do it  You know, make some money  For the Elizabeth Clasier  Pediatric Science Foundation  I'll be happy  But that's cool  You know, inspired by that  It was a great play  I mean, I love Jersey Boys  You know, it was really a lot of fun  And so you narrate  So you pretty much  You kind of hang out  Are you on stage  You're backstage  Pretty much just kind of  Reading into a mic  No, no  I'm actually learning the whole thing  You know, like  So you want to be a rock and roll star  How would you like to really make it? 
[02:49:30]  I mean, really make it  You know  Ferrari in the driveway  Two swimming pools  You know  I flew to Paris for an omelet  I fell asleep in Morocco  For two weeks  I started to tie  In South American countries  You know  And then, you know  I go into this big spiel  Of the opening rap  And then the band starts playing  And it's really  The play really moves  It's got a good movement to it  It's got a bunch of new songs in it  So  What are you hoping happens from it?  Like, obviously  You're doing it for a couple weeks now  And do you want to take it  To eventually Broadway  Or do you want to go to Broadway?  Well, I mean  I don't want to go to Broadway  When they close Young Frankenstein 
[02:50:00]  It's Spamalot  Two great plays on Broadway  When Broadway's falling apart  I'm not interested in that  You know what?  I saw Young Frankenstein on Broadway  It was good, huh?  Yeah  It was really good  And I'm not really into the Broadway scene  But definitely  Let me get the plug in there, Eddie  Two tickets to Paradise  The musical at the  Dix Hills Performing Arts Center  Dix Hills, New York  June 4th through the 7th  And then June 11th through the 24th  DHPAC.org for tickets and info  And you can go to EddieMoney.com  Yeah, DHPAC, thank you  DHPAC.org  That means like  Sills Performing Arts Center

[03:11:00]  I won't say  She's a drunk  Look at that  Now she's got that  Little silvery skirt on  She's in front of a  Huge mixing board  Kind of leaning on it  Wearing nice heels  She's got one leg cocked  Her head tilted slightly  Jimmy I'm way ahead of you  Golden blonde hair  Over her shoulders  I'm way ahead of you Jimmy  I think I'm gonna stalk  Eddie Money's daughter  Well she's in LA  She's 20 years too old for you  Eddie Money's daughter  Wowee to all my followers  OP Radio  There you go  Ha ha ha ha ha ha 
[03:11:30]  I beat you Jimmy on that one  Actually your picture  Didn't come up  I'm looking at your Twitter  It did not come out  No it's up there  Oh shit  It's up there  Oh shit yo  Uh Eddie Money  Eddie Money  Money Eddie Money  Oh speaking of music  I gotta give props to  Propellers  Octane  I was listening to a little  Octane over the weekend  Yes  Uh when I wasn't listening  To the Grateful Dead channel  Cause they were jamming  Some nice  Saint Stephen  Saint Stephen  Oh fuck  I did that  Jesus  I did that to bother you 
[03:12:00]  The Grateful Dead channel  Saint Stephen  I don't know the words  I just go with it  Good  And then a little  Ico Ico all day  Doesn't hurt anybody  It doesn't  You like Ico Ico  No  You might  I listen to Octane  I listen to Lithium  No this wasn't on Octane  I listen to Alt Nation  I listen to the  Hair  Fucking  OutQ  I listen to OutQ  A lot  Shade  I listen to the Shade  No  And then occasionally  I got the classics up there  And the Decades 
[03:12:30]  I'm gonna be a little late  On this one  I understand  For the Octane fans  But I have Octane on  You know  And I'm listening to this song  I think it was Seether  The band Seether  And I'm like  How do I fucking know this song  And then I'm like  Oh yeah  I can see  Cause you know  The display  Tells you stuff  Tells you things  And I'm like  They redid Careless Whisper  Who did Careless Whisper  Wham  Or was it George Michael  Nice fucking  Oak says  They did Careless Whisper  Bam  The music started 
[03:13:00]  Listen to this  Who did this  Was it George Michael  By himself  Or was it a Wham song  That was Wham  It was Wham  So it was  Turn this up a little bit  The other guy from Wham  Yes  The guy who doesn't like cock  It was a good shot  To Seether  I feel so unsure  As I take your hand 
[03:13:30]  And lead you to the dance floor  As the music dies  Would never fucking recognize this  That's good  It's one of those songs  I'm like  Wait I know this  I know this  How do I know this  Except for that riff  And actually I didn't want to look down  Cause I tried to figure it out  But I'm never gonna dance again  Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm  Though it's easy to pretend  I know you're not a fool 
[03:14:00]  I should have known better than to treat a friend  And waste the chance that I've been given  So I'm never gonna dance again  The way I dance with you  That's Italian  When you can take a wimpy song  Like Careless Whisper  A faggot song  Like Careless Whisper  And make it cool  And kind of yeah  Look I know Careless Whisper  The original  I mean I think everybody does  You wouldn't search it out 
[03:14:30]  But that fucking Caesar  Just made that song cool  Oh here's the original  Listen to the original  Listen to the difference  Jimmy get your dick out of my ass  Stop it  Not now  I'd catch to this song  I wouldn't pitch  Yeah but if you're playing Caesar  Then you're kidding  Just in a bathroom  Jerking off  In a fucking park somewhere  Listen to the difference  I feel so unsure  As I take your hand 
[03:15:00]  And lead you to the dance floor  As the music dies  It's okay  Cause to mind a silver screen  And all it's at home  I'm never gonna dance again  A little secret laugh  Just now  It's hard to dance 
[03:15:30]  When you're on your knees  Behind a park bench  Getting leaves on your pants  With a dick in your face  Getting twigs in your fucking cuffs  That's how you always know  He's been blowing somebody  When you have little leaves  On the fucking front of his slacks  Those fucking little  Little hitchhiker things  Are all in your pants  They're awful  You gotta rip them out  It's like Velcro  And he has piss on one knee  Cause he was also sucking a dick  Inside the bathroom  And he knelt in piss  Holy shit  That is so gay 
[03:16:00]  And the other one  Kinda rocks  Well you know  Playing the other side  Of this Stig from Whack Bag  See their maid  Careless whisper sound  Like every song on rock radio  Good work boys  You took gay  And made it generic  Well you know something  Better generic than gay  Who cares  I liked it  What can I tell you  It's actually hard to do  I liked it  Yeah  Sorry  Sorry man  It's such a generic rock song  Great  Congrats man  They took a gay song  And just made it like  Everything else  The establishment 
[03:16:30]  Pumps out  Man  Shut up  Too cool for the fucking room  Dick  Okay fuck it  What's next  Exactly  What do you listen to  Something so obscure  No one's heard it  Oh fuck your mother  That was probably from  George M. in England  You know what's funny  About Cedar doing  Careless whisper  Someone in the band  Had to go  Alright guys  Hear me out  Yeah  No listen  Listen to why  Listen to what I'm  About to tell you  I think  They had to 
[03:17:00]  Have just killed the guy  For a while  Yeah  And then someone said  No no  Alright wait wait  Here's my idea  Let me try this a little bit  How do you bring  Careless whisper  To your cool rock band  Oh  I hate people that like  Judge music  And other people's music  Music is so fucking  Personality  Driven  That's why some people  Like some shit  And some like other stuff  Yeah  It's not  For someone to go  Oh you like that  Now blatantly gay shit  Is just blatantly gay shit  I don't like it 
[03:17:30]  But there are people  That fucking like it  I like the number one song  In the country right now  What can I tell you  What is that Opie  It's not Poker Face  Which is a good song too  Yeah  For a little guilty pleasure  Poke her face  Poke her face  Right  Yeah  It's that other one  The boom song  Oh boom boom boom  Let's go back to my room  No  That was a good one  Hey Travis  You got the boom song  With Fergie  Oof  I don't know this one  You sound like Lydia now  Go fuck yourself  Does that sound like Lydia  Who does  I'm just saying  Someone said I sound like Lydia now  Because I'm not trying to psychoanalyze 
[03:18:00]  I'm just saying  You know  Music is subjective  Look  I went from talking about  The Grateful Dead  Doing St. Stephen  Which by the way  It went on for 25 minutes  Because I timed it  And then went in to see  They're doing Careless Whisper  There's a lot of different  Music tastes right there  Right there  Now unless  Except for the Grateful Dead  Which I will say  If you do listen to that  You're fucking  It's shit  It's just  A big pile of shit  No that's pop  Which they hate  That's Beginner Dead  I love that  Man  That's Beginner Dead 
[03:18:30]  Man  I love telling Dead fans  That is the best song  They ever did  They will fucking just  They don't like that Jimmy  It's a good song  No man  And all I'm hearing  Is Warren Haynes  Doing a great job  Because the Dead's back on tour  Are they  I don't know how the fuck  They pulled that one off  Without Jerry Garcia  Do they have the big  Following still  Or no  All the older Deadheads  Are definitely checking out the show  I haven't checked it out yet  Boom Boom Pow  Yeah  This is the number one song  In America  Jimmy's gonna hate this one  Sure I will  Boom Boom Pow Pow 
[03:19:00]  Sounds scary at the beginning  Gotta get get  Uh oh  Gotta get get  Gotta get get  Gotta get get get get get  I've heard this  It sounds like something you hear  In a Brazilian fucking whorehouse  Oh I hate this  While they're all dancing  Gotta get get  Who sings this?
