<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a prolonged, explicit description of a woman showering in a building across the street from the studio. This twenty-minute segment, punctuated by listener calls detailing their own voyeuristic experiences, served as a bizarre opening.  The hosts then transitioned into a game where listeners guessed the ingredients of a Penthouse magazine semen simulation (powdered sugar and Karo syrup).  The segment concluded with a discussion about the hosts' missing Lexus, which had been borrowed and not returned, creating escalating problems with the lender.  Scheduled guests Dennis Leary and Adam Ferrara were mentioned.

The show continued with a lengthy discussion about Vince McMahon's purchase of WCW.  Numerous callers—Paul, Tim, Mark, Oscar, Tommy, and West Coast Dave—speculated on the business ramifications and potential storylines, focusing on which WCW wrestlers (Goldberg, Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Jeff Jarrett) would join the WWF, the future of WCW, and the implications for Wrestlemania.  Audio clips of Vince McMahon’s announcements were played, highlighting his aggressive style, and the surprising twist of Shane McMahon taking over WCW was heavily discussed.

In-studio guests Dennis Leary and Adam Ferrara, promoting their ABC show "The Job," joined the hosts.  They discussed the show's creation, filming anecdotes (including one about Adam Ferrara's massage experience), and upcoming episodes.  Earl, a studio employee, participated in a conversation about video game characters that devolved into a racially charged discussion involving callers Manny and Stinky.  The "Best Ass" contest was promoted, along with sponsors like Planet Java iced coffee.  A clip from a PBS show about war games was played, and Anthony recounted an embarrassing past encounter with Dennis Leary.

The conversation with Leary and Ferrara continued, shifting to "The Comics Come Home," a potential actors' strike affecting Leary's summer plans, and Leary's frustrations with actors' negotiations, specifically regarding residuals.  A humorous anecdote about a female comedian forcing Leary to eat a sandwich from her cleavage was shared.  A caller complained about Ferrara's smoking.  Leary and Ferrara praised "The Job's" unique style and use of strong language ("the T-word," "balls," and the "C-word"), contrasting it with radio restrictions.  They launched a humorous "Save the C" campaign.  The discussion included calls about Leary's outdoor hockey rink and his participation in games, as well as promotion of his movie *Blow*.  The segment also touched upon Giuliani's crackdown on Times Square sex shops, a woman showering in a building visible from the studio (again), and a video of a century-old woman having sex. The segment concluded with promotion of "The Job" and a Randy Johnson bird-hitting video on ESPN.com.

The final segment focused heavily on Mayor Rudy Giuliani, his policies regarding sex shops, and his perceived hypocrisy regarding toll increases.  The hosts offered absurd solutions to traffic congestion.  A significant portion was dedicated to an in-studio interview with Mario Polite, the actor who played the rapist in a *Sopranos* episode.  The hosts engaged in explicit humor with Polite, discussing the rape scene's filming in graphic detail.  Polite also discussed the episode's dog attack scene.  The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was also discussed, with various callers and brief appearances from other guests, including an intern attracted to Mario Polite, and a failed attempt to connect with Dennis Leary.  Commercial breaks featured Stacker 2 and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  The segment ended with a discussion about a radio advertisement featuring Polite promoting the show using his *Sopranos* character, and a debate on the ad's acceptability.

Yeah, she's washing her hair  She's washing her hair now  Right in front of the window  Her arms are off  Look, look, look  We got bush  Dude, we got bush  No, Anthony  That would be a land  Yeah, I guess a landing strip  Yeah, she's got the landing strip  Little bush  Mini bush  Look at that 
[00:03:00]  The side view right now  She's turned to the side  A little water now  Very nice  She's under the stream of water  Uh-huh  This is hotter than like any porno you could watch  Because it's just complete peeping Tom voyeurism  And we haven't had one of these in a while  Because we're usually too busy trying to put on a radio show for you guys  Yeah  This is usually something that the morning show gets  Right  You know, when people are showering to leave  And I guess they've got to take the bad with the good  You know, because something tells me they're in a babe in every one of these windows  No, this girl is beautiful 
[00:03:30]  Very nice  Uh-oh, where'd she go?  Where'd she go?  She's rinsing, Opie  We can't quite see when she's rinsing  Well, when she steps back  The shower head, I guess, is behind the bricks over there  Yeah  Right?  And then she has to step back  Plus she's got a cream rinse  You know, you've got to put the conditioner in the hair  Maybe she's on to us  We haven't seen her in about 10, 15 seconds now  She'll poke that ass  That white ass back out in no time  Well, Opie, I dare to dream  I hope she does 
[00:04:00]  Because if she doesn't  That means we've got to go sit back  And we've got to look at you for the rest of the day  As we wait for the naked lady to get back in front of the window  We should tell everyone that  Dennis Leary will be on the show today  Yes  From that hot new show, The Job  Which we're all digging  It's on, what, Wednesday nights?  Maybe Saturday  This is Drew Carey, right?  Yeah  9.30  9.30  Anthony, where did she go?  I'm thinking she's rinsing  We might have to do real radio in a minute here  It takes a while  Oh my gosh, she better not be on to us  No  Believe me, she would have been on to us a lot sooner than this 
[00:04:30]  Maybe she's using the shower massage  Well, can't they blow that window out a little wider?  Who owns that building?  Put picture windows in there  They are big windows to be in a bathroom  They're full-size windows  So it's not like a little bathroom window  And she's got no curtain on it  The best day was the day we got to see the girl trim downstairs  Yeah, she was grooming her lap  Had no clue that about 12 guys were watching from our vantage point 
[00:05:00]  Maybe they do have a clue  You know, maybe she does  She's got to know outside her window is another huge building  She can see it  And she's in front of the window in the shower  Oh, okay  That's her ass  That's her ass poking out  She's bending down  She's bending over  She's having like the waterfall of water, you know  Cascade over her head  Over her butt  Is it or is she leaning backwards to rinse her head?  Can't tell  I can't tell what position she's in right now 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, we can barely see anything  Because the window's a little steamed up  Here she is  Oh, no, you were  Oh, there she goes  Oh, no, don't leave, don't leave  Oh, there it is  Show's over  We got to see her ass stepping out of the shower  Fantastic job by this unknown girl  Wow  In the building right next door  I want to thank Rick and Ben for getting the mics  Yeah, that was like an emergency mic setup  As I pulled my headphones out  All right, let me get back on my mic  All right, hold on 
[00:06:00]  Now we're ready to broadcast  God, what a way to start a show, man  That is great  That rock  That worked perfectly  You know, we were looking at Penthouse  Before we came down to the studio  Yeah  That was better than anything you could see in Penthouse  No offense to Nick and the gang over at Penthouse  But, man, that Boyer stuff  Never gets old  All right 
[00:06:30]  That was good  Carmen, what's going on?  You guys are two lunatics  Why?  You're a lunatic  Why?  Opie, you do belong in the nut house  She doesn't like us, remember, Carmen?  Oh, you're the one  You're the one that hates us  She hates us and listens every effing day  I'm trying to get your ratings up  Don't worry, I think what we just did got our ratings up  They're fine, believe me  No one else  Or your pecker up  No one else in this town will do a peeping Tom bit on the radio  For 20 minutes 
[00:07:00]  That's why you're going to be off the air soon  I got insight  Yeah, of course, Carmen  Yeah  Maybe off the air here  She wishes that people would watch her in the shower  John, what's going on?  Hey, I just want to know if we're going to see pictures on the internet  Uh, no  Uh, no  I'm a boyer  Yeah, no one thought of grabbing a goddamn camera  You got mic, but no camera  Telephoto lens  We need the whole setup over here  You know, John  Next time  We hit pay dirt  Because, you know, I would even stare at a big, fat, ugly chick showering 
[00:07:30]  Just because you can  Yeah, why not?  Just because you're able to  But this girl was  Would you say an 8 to 9?  Oh, yeah  Easily, right?  Yeah  Nice brunette  Nice body  Nice boobs  She has to know  She had all the parts in all the right places  She has to know  Why the hell would she stand there  In front of an open window  Showering with a building  That is a lot higher than her window  Right  Right there  God, it just makes you feel good all over  Doesn't it?  We got, like, a full show 
[00:08:00]  It was a shower show  People pay for that, you know  There are some times  I mean, this is the chance you take  People will yell  You guys got to understand  These showers go on, you know, all day long  And every once in a while  Someone will look out the window  And just scream, shower  Yeah  So then you run to the window  Hoping for the best  Sometimes, you know  You see something you wish you didn't see  Yeah  Mainly, man ass  Oh, that was a couple of times that happened  Like, somebody showering in front of one of those windows 
[00:08:30]  That are frosted  Yeah  And it's all steamed up  And you just see a form back there  And everyone looks  Oh, we got to shower, we got to shower  Everyone runs to the window  And then you see this big  Friggin' crow's nest mess  Kind of through the window  And you realize  Oh, no  Yeah  That's a guy  That's a guy  What about the  Hold on, hold on, what?  What about the couple we saw having sex?  Remember that?  In the shower  Almost two years ago  I didn't see that  Oh, you didn't see that?  No  Everyone was outside  That was outside the building 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, people were standing in front of Hooters  And looking up  At a couple having sex through the window  This building right across the way is a hot spot for this type of activity  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, Owen, you guys are crazy  Why?  I want to know one thing  Who was the pervert who was staring out the window looking for this  Who saw it first?  It was Opie  Yeah, it was  Yeah, Opie was looking out the window  And he just goes  We got to shower, we got to shower  And this place was mobilized like a scramble on a  Dan, every day before 
[00:09:30]  On an airbase  Every day before we start the show  I look really fast to see if anyone's showering  And if they're not  Then we got to  You know, we got to start the show  We can't just sit and wait for two hours  For someone to jump into a shower, you know  We lucked out today  So finally, I'm not the only person who does that then?  I think every guy would take a peek  If that was going on across their way  Look at Mike F. trying to ruin us  Ruin it  You know, a couple of hundred feet  Will cover up a world of hurt  It's not that far away, Pally  No, it's  That's about 50 feet 
[00:10:00]  Tops  Yeah  No, the girl was fine  Yeah  And I don't even care  Because, you know, when we first moved to New York  We've told this story a bunch of times  Where basically  Anthony and I  Stared at a lady making spaghetti sauce  In an old lady's bathing suit  For two hours  For two hours  That was disgusting  This ancient woman  She's wearing a big one-piece bathing suit  Stirring her sauce  Old lady bathing suit  And occasionally her shoulder strap would fall off 
[00:10:30]  And be the sick F's we are  She had to be 65  Easily  The strap would fall off her shoulder  And we'd be like  Yeah  You stir that sauce, you effing whore  We're just screaming out the window  I know we ran and got binoculars to get a better look  Yeah  Just to make sure that she was indeed old  You stir that sauce, you bitch  All right, let's get Gina on the phone  Gina, what's up?  Hey, Yone, what's going on?  Hey  Why don't you get Ben or Rick or somebody to go over there 
[00:11:00]  And see if you can get her on the show?  See, we don't want to ruin it  You know, she's there  Now we have our window marked  We know where it is  And we'll check it out every afternoon  Yeah, but how do you know she's not one of the freaky chicks  She'll show up on Freaky Friday  Or on your couch or something?  See, no, because it's different than that  Yeah, we get to see the nudity in the studio  And that's all cool  You know, don't get me wrong  But to see what we just saw is even cooler  Through, yeah, through the window  All right, try to get her on the site  Knowing that she could be a good girl  And she has no idea that 12 guys are staring at her  And we're broadcasting it to the whole tri-state area 
[00:11:30]  That is hot  You think she's of age or what?  She definitely, yeah, I would say so  She looks like she was in her early 20s  I'd say wait a few more times and get somebody down there  All right, thanks, Gina  Later, guys  Andy from East Meadow  How long does Rick keep watching after you realize it's a man in the show?  You know, we take a gamble, too, to share with everybody  Because we can ruin it  Because if she's a listener of our show  Then we just wrecked it forever  She'll never take a shower just before 3 o'clock 
[00:12:00]  And, you know, you yelling  We got a chick in the shower  You're taking a big chance there, too  Because you know what happens when someone yells  Oh, we got a shower, we got a shower  And everyone looks and it turns out to be a guy  Oh, be faggot  No, this time there's no doubt, though  No  The first shot I saw was nothing but long  Long hair down the shoulders, the boobs, and the butt  I mean, it was just like  What did I do to deserve this today?  And then she turned around to pick up some of the shampoo  And you saw a bush 
[00:12:30]  Boobage  The whole peckage  Yes, let's go  Nice  Let's go to Mario  Mario, what's up?  Boys  Hey, Mario  What's going on?  Hey  Just want to know if you see any fudge conditioner bottles in there  No fudge products  No, but she had like 12 different shampoo-type bottles lined up  And she used every single one  Yeah  Damn, I was hoping she gets to work like Brittany did  Yeah  All right, man, thank you  Later, Blaise  Bye  I don't think she officially shaved, Anthony 
[00:13:00]  It looked like she was going for the shave  But not down there, no  She was doing something  Maybe she was exfoliating  Yeah  Eddie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey  Listen, I was in rehab at St. Cabrini Hospital  Right  Looking out the window  This girl was doing track work outside the roof  You know, on top of the roof  Totally nude  Every day at 8.40  The five days I was in rehab  She ran  Balls-ass naked 
[00:13:30]  I hope it wasn't balls-ass naked  Well, you know what I mean  Well, I got another voyeur thing I do from this building  What's that?  The one I share with Ken Stevens  Oh, what's that?  Our general manager who's having that affair  Let me show, guys  All right  Our general manager that's having that affair with Melissa from Philadelphia  Uh-huh  Hot Melissa  Yeah  We're on to Ken  Yeah, we know  Matter of fact, he's busy throwing his wife a bone  They're on vacation  So they're in the Caribbean somewhere  Just to make it look nicey-nice and stuff  So they can go back to banging Melissa when he gets back 
[00:14:00]  What should I pick up for my girlfriend, Melissa?  Honey, I'm going to be over here by the souvenir stand  Oh, I've got to pick up something special for her  Yeah, but from his office  Yeah  There's a lady that loves to work out in her bra and panties  Oh, yeah?  And she has never taken off the bra and panties, though  And every time we're like, this has got to be the day  It's going to happen today  Oh, you'll watch every day  She gets on a treadmill that she's got right in her apartment 
[00:14:30]  She's got, I mean, you see the wall behind you?  Yes  What is it, 20 feet or whatever?  Yeah  That's all window in her apartment  Oh, that way  Wide open to the world  She, uh, and she does her treadmill  As she looks over, you know, the buildings  And, uh, and we take a peek  Yeah  Waiting for the bra and panties to come off  And they never will  But you know something?  It's okay because there's that hope that they might someday  Right  It's all you need is a little hope  Right  You'll stay there forever  All right, let's go to Tommy  Tommy, what's up?  Hey, ONA, what's going on? 
[00:15:00]  Hey, man  Listen, voyeurism in Manhattan is the best  I'm in the Carpenters Union, right?  And a couple years ago, we're on a job  A brand new building they were putting up  In the Columbus Circle  And they're filming a porn movie  Right across from us in the alleyway  Uh-huh  You know, maybe there's an alleyway between the buildings  Maybe about 18 feet away  Right  Because of the lighting or whatever  They knew that everybody in the building  All the union guys were watching them  But they had to leave the shades open  Just so they could have good lighting  Uh-huh  So you had two girls and a guy in bed  And now within four or five floors of our building 
[00:15:30]  Everybody was pinned against the window  So freaking tight  You thought the building was going to collapse  Man, it's the best  It was going to fall over into that building  It just makes your day complete  Yeah  It makes your week complete  I've been working, man  At 15 years  Lawyerism is incredible  The wintertime was stomp out and cloudy  You could see across those windows  Right  Until the shower steams up  And then everybody goes back to work  Right  Once the windows get all stained  That's it  Great  All right, thank you, Tommy  Take it easy  Bye  I could give everyone in Manhattan a tip 
[00:16:00]  I don't know if I want to wreck this one, though  Uh-oh, what?  Don't ruin anything  All right, I got it, though  If you want a cheap thrill  You want to see girls topless  Yeah  It is easier than you think  And you don't have to go to strip clubs  You know this  And  I've never shared this  You've never shared  And I will share today  There are some hotels  If you go to the roof  Yeah  Ben, you know, right?  Go to the roof 
[00:16:30]  Maybe I shouldn't say it, then  Go to the roof  Well, it's a good secret, though, right?  Go to the roof  You go to the roof  And, you know, they have the pools  On the top of the roof and stuff  The hotel pool and whatever  And, you know, and then people lay out and stuff  All the Europeans that come to New York  They think nothing of, you know, taking their tops off  Ah  You go to the roof in some of these hotels  There's nothing but boobs everywhere  Try it out, see if it works  Well, the weather's got to get a little warmer  But there you go  A little tip for you all  Lewis, what's up?

[00:17:30]  Runs to the window  But like Anthony said  You know, sometimes you commit a little early  Next thing you know  You're there with 12 other guys behind you  And you're the one that called the shower  And next thing you know  At the same time  Everyone realizes it's a man  And it's a man-ass  And you look like a complete fool  Yeah  Just out of curiosity, guys  Has any unidentifiable smells  Been wafting through the system lately?

[00:34:30]  The April issue of Penthouse  And I came up with  A little observation  Yeah we need a little  Clarification  Um  Hmm  How do we say this  Without uh  Just call it  Saying too much  Call it the money shot  Okay  Or the byproduct  Of uh  Physical  Of a romantic  Physical contact  Alright well  There you go  Very good Anthony  First of all  First observation  There's too much uh  Too much junk  Right  In Penthouse 
[00:35:00]  Well there's a  A whole spread  That you're looking at there  Of a girl  Giving a Hummer  Giving a Hummer  Okay  And then this is the shot  I have a problem with  The money shot  The money shot  You know the last page  Of the uh  Hummer pictorial  Let me read Anthony  Alright  And I think we can get this  On the air  Let's give it a whirl  Just so uh  Everyone has that  Fine visual in their head  Before we get to Nick  Okay  Mmhmm  Blank in my mouth  Lisa pleads  Oh  You can say that right  Blank  They said it all the time  On match game  You can say that right 
[00:35:30]  Wow  Boom  Boom  Boom  Boom  Boom  Boom  Ho  Ho  That's for a popper  Ho  Ho  Get that match game  All right  So it says  Blank in my mouth  Right  I don't know what that means  Blank  Lisa pleads  Blanking more passionately  On Tony's blank  Ah  Richard Dawson says  Chicken  Then her finger inches  Toward his  Blank blank  Blank blank  She blanks just the tip 
[00:36:00]  Oh  And it is enough to make his blank  Um  Hmm  What  His blank erupts  All over her  Blank  Yeah  Glazing her blank  And blank  With his  Blank blank  Brett Summers says  Brett  What's your answer  I say 
[00:36:30]  It's gotta be  A Buick  Okay  Looking up with a smile  Lisa asks  Are you up for working  Late tonight  What  Running back  Tony answers  Whatever you need  Boss  Ah  It's the boss  And the guy  Is the worker  Right  All right  All right  So  Now everyone has the visual  Money shot  Money shot  Right there  Mouth agape  How's that for a copper 
[00:37:00]  That's a copper  And um  There is a byproduct  Just streaming down  But uh  This is the observation  Ant and I made  Like  We've been through  One of these penthouse shoots  And you don't do anything  Without them studying the shot  Making sure the lighting's perfect  Everything's calculated  Everything is set up  They don't leave things to chance  When they're taking these pictures  So  How could they possibly leave 
[00:37:30]  A money shot  To chance  That it's gonna  Look like that  When they're done  The perfect  Um  That's the perfect money shot  That is perfect  See down on her chin  Right  How do you make sure  That's gonna happen  Right  That little  Globule  Is gonna happen  Cause if it was a messy  Right  Money shot  I think you could say that  I mean  Or maybe sometimes  What if there wasn't enough  Or it wasn't  Or uh  It ended up somewhere  A little awkward  Quite frankly  If it was messy  It would mess up 
[00:38:00]  This fine makeup job  That the makeup artist  Had to do  Right  For this particular shot  You're right  So  We were thinking  The lipstick  The lipstick  The mascara  Uh huh  The pancake makeup  Oh well  That could be it too  So uh  Ant and I have decided  That uh  Wow we're going out  On a limb here  But we're thinking  That this is um  Some other substance  It's not real  It's not real  It's gotta be  Some type of formula  Some type of  Concoction  Right  That they whip up  And apply 
[00:38:30]  And it looks just like  The byproduct  Now we can make  A game out of this  Nick  Yeah  Alright  A couple things  Listen very carefully  Because we might  Make a game out of this  Okay  Uh  I'm not on air  Yes you are  Yeah  Oh I'm sorry  Got it  What you can't be on air  No no yeah  We're cool  Alright  I thought we'd work  That out with you  Um  Are we  Don't say what it is  But are we right  To assume that  That's not actual  You know what  Uh  On occasion  That is a correct assumption  Alright what about 
[00:39:00]  On page 123  Of the latest issue  Of a penthouse  Of the pictorial  Of the pictorial  In question  Yes  That is a correct assumption  That is not real  Right  Alright  Nick can we play a game  Guess the substance  Sure  Alright  Now  What do we got Ben  What do we got Ben Hurd DVDs  Damn you  I can't believe  You're giving away  My greatest movie ever  In conjunction  With such a disgusting  Contest

[00:58:30]  On a limb and say that  Let's ask him  I don't think he enjoys  Being a black man  I think he feels  It would be a lot easier  To be lazy  If he was white  We could ask him  Is he coming down the hall  Did he have  The black G.I. Joe  Something tells me  He never even  F'd around with G.I. Joe  He's coming  Why don't we get into  The Vince McMahon thing  Anthony  Okay  Alright  We'll start with Paul  Paul what's going on  Tools what's up  Hey buddy  Listen last night  Was Vince McMahon's  Wet dream come true 
[00:59:00]  Yeah  Without a doubt  He got to finally  Tell Ted Turner  To shove it  He hates all those  Good old southern  Wrestling boys  So he's finally  Taking over  And doing what  His daddy wanted him  To do back in the day  Let's just say this  Wrestling just got  Really good again  Uh huh  Yeah  I mean we've talked  About it on the show  Same storylines  We've been waiting  For something  You know explosive  To happen  Vince McMahon  Buying the WCW  It's just  It's just unbelievable  Hopey Shane has it 
[00:59:30]  Oh that's it  I want to correct you  Shane  It wasn't Vince  That bought it  Shane has it now  Shane  Right  In a stunning upset  He kind of  Signed the contract  I will be watching  Wrestling twice a week  Now for the next  Few months  No problem  No problem  Do you think  He's bringing back  Some of those dinosaurs  Like Hogan and Nash  And Flair  Or what do you think  He's going to do  He's going to get rid  Of those bumps  He should parade them  Around to look like  The buffoons that they are  Like Hulk Hogan  And what's he going to  Come out to  I want to be a Hulkamaniac  And tell the kids 
[01:00:00]  To take their  Oh no no no  Come back with the NWO  Wrestling against the WWF  Like with Hogan  Nash  All  Steiner  Buff  And then like  Taking on  Like The Rock  And Stone Cold  And all those guys  He's going to take  The most popular wrestlers  Or most of them  From the WCW  And move them over  To the WWF eventually  And make them just  Huger than life  But to begin with  I think  This coming weekend  On Wrestlemania  I wouldn't be surprised  If you see Goldberg  And maybe like  The Hulkster 
[01:00:30]  Oh you think so  The Hulkster  In Shane's corner  I'm going to listen to myself  The place will just  Lose it  If Goldberg comes out  You will see the place  Just go crazy  Because even he had  The crossover thing  A lot of the wrestlers  Don't cross over well  You know  If you're not going to see  Jeff Jarrett coming back  To  No we were talking about  In the back office  Jeff Jarrett is  Odd man out  I feel bad for him  He was in the WWF  Decided that the WCW  Could give him a better deal  Or whatever  So he left the WWF 
[01:01:00]  And Vince made a point  Yesterday on the broadcast  To pretty much tell Jeff Jarrett  That he's fired  He's done  And that was as real as it gets  You're fired  He was spelling his new name  Which is  Double G  Double O  Double N  Double E  And that was the real Vince  Rubbing it in  Oh yeah  And he finally got back  At Jeff Jarrett  You can tell  There's the Vince character  Uh huh  Last night  But a lot of his  His real personality  Was coming through  Yeah  Uh Tim what's going on 
[01:01:30]  Tim  Hey  He waited way too long  But if you weren't  Watching TV yesterday  Even if you're a slight  Wrestling fan  It was just amazing TV  Because Vince McMahon  Did a simulcast  On his WWF broadcast  And also on the  WCW broadcast  Uh huh  They have been competing  Against each other  On Monday nights  For a very long time  Yeah  So all of a sudden  Vince is talking  To the WCW audience  And the WWF audience  I don't know  If you realize  How huge that is 
[01:02:00]  It was weird  It was strange  They had each other's  Throats for many many years  Yeah  Just hatred  Here's the announcement  Here's Vince McMahon  From last night  For the first time ever  In sports entertainment history  This broadcast  Is not only being seen  Here on TNN  And Cleveland, Ohio  Ohio  Is also  Being seen across  TNN  What an idiot  Hold it right there 
[01:02:30]  Network  He screwed up  He couldn't even  Get it right  It's TNN  Is  The Nashville  Or the National Network  Oh yeah  Boy I'm fooled  Yeah TNN is WWF  And TNT is WCW  So he meant to say TNT  And he says TNN again  Nice move Vince  You jackass  Television  Now there's only one way  That that can happen  There's only one way  And one man  That can make  History 
[01:03:00]  Like this  Happen  Who's that Vince  Obviously  You all know  I have acquired  WCW  That's right  I bought my competition  Just think of the storylines  Now that he has done that  Yeah  Opens it way up  Unbelievable 
[01:03:30]  Mark what's going on  Hey guys  What's up  Hey  Listen  Picture this  Vince McMahon's wife  Comes out  Starts making out  With Ted Turner  Right in the middle  Of the ring  And Shane stands over  And now I got you  Dad  I don't think  You're going to see  A Ted Turner  Making any appearances  I really don't think so  You know  But there's so many  Possibilities  I would be really surprised  If Vince doesn't  Break out something  Just huge now 
[01:04:00]  For Wrestlemania  This coming time  Oh yeah  There's a bunch of options  Just over the top  Huge  Yeah  Something  Something  Something big  I cannot wait  I cannot wait  To check out Wrestlemania now  Yeah  Haven't been this excited  About wrestling  In about a year  Some more audio  From Vince  From last night  Time Warner  Is practically  Begging me  They're practically  Begging me  To buy  WCW  And I have agreed  Oscar  What's going on 
[01:04:30]  Hey  What's up fellas  Hey  Yo  Awesome stuff  Last night  First thought  Is the contract  That Vince isn't  Isn't going to pick up  Guys like Goldberg  Kevin Nash  Scott Steiner  They all have  Guaranteed contracts  Right  He's not picking those up  How do you know that  Because what do you call it  It's just not worth it  For money wise  Because now there's  Other guys that have  Like 90 day contracts  Those who can renegotiate  But these other guys  They're being paid  To sit at home  Oscar  Yeah but  Vince has all the power  I mean  Where is someone like Goldberg  Going to wrestle  If he decides not to write 
[01:05:00]  Well he hasn't been on TV  For three months  Goldberg is basically lazy  He always treats wrestling  Like if it's like  His second job  Well that's why  The WCW sucked  But Vince is going to  Turn all these guys around  You either come to WWF  And play by my rules  Or you leave wrestling  Whatever  I don't need you  Exactly  And you watch how  Most of these guys  Do whatever Vince says  Well Kevin Nash  Is on record  That he's going to stay at home  For the next 10 months  The WWF does not need  A Kevin Nash  Okay  Oh no doubt  They need Goldberg  They need a 
[01:05:30]  Booker T  Booker T  Puff Daddy  Big Papa Pump  Those are the guys  They want to go after  Big Papa Pump is like a cripple  And he also  He's more famous  For beating people up backstage  Than beating them up in the ring  Well whatever  It's a whole new ball game  Oh no doubt  We'll have to wait and see  Later guys  Alright man  Some more audio  Time Warner  They've signed the contract  And I will sign the contract  But I'll sign it  This Sunday  On pay per view  At Wrestlemania  And I'll sign it 
[01:06:00]  When Ted Turner himself  Walks down the aisle  At Wrestlemania  And delivers a contract  In front of him  He's so cocky man  I love it  Tommy what's up  What's going on boys  Hey  That whole thing with Jeff Shavart  Was basically  Remember there was a pay per view  I think last year  Right before he went to WCW  Where he lost to China  The Continental Belt  Yeah okay  I remember  Okay well his contract 
[01:06:30]  Expired that Saturday  The pay per view  Was that Sunday  And the only way  That he would show up  Is if he had a one day extension  And he only agreed on  $250,000 to be there  That's why Vince  Is doing this to him now  Because there's no way  Because he would have  Left with the belt  And went to WCW  With the belt  Oh he squeezed him  Exactly  Vince is like  Smell what are you going to do  Yeah yeah  You will not see Jeff Jarrett  And also tomorrow night  I don't know if you guys know yet  But with Smackdown  Is actually being taped tonight  Shawn Michaels is coming out too  Come on  It's the way out  For Wrestlemania  So it's going to be crazy this week  And when Shane fights Vince 
[01:07:00]  Don't be shocked  To see WCW guys  Come get Shane's back  Oh hell yeah  Well we know that already  We're just wondering  Who's going to come out  And get his back  I'm here on Goldberg  But we can take your word for it  Shawn Michaels comes back  On Smackdown Thursday  Guaranteed  And Mankind  Came back last night  Oh yeah  This is shaping up  To be an insane Wrestlemania  Well you never know  You might see Mick Foley  Go with Shane  And maybe start a WCW thing  And then screw Shane  There's just so much  That's going to happen  You know what could happen  I hope we're not boring people  But this was a huge night  For wrestling  Mankind 
[01:07:30]  Shane could ask Mankind  To be the commissioner  Of WCW  Oh yeah  You got a lot of things  Going back and forth  It's going to be great  The next couple of years  Is going to be great now  Alright Tommy  Later buddy  Yeah they'll play this out  For at least a year  Where it's Shane  Shane controls one league  And Vince the WWF  But it's all the same  Well we all know  It's a great storyline  For them  Because now they could  Pit it against each other  Like they're still competitors  Right  Yet they're owned by Vince  And then they can just  Weed out who wants to play  And who doesn't want to play  And eventually 
[01:08:00]  It'll just be the WWF again  Yeah  Now then some would say  Geez Vince  How did you do it?  How did you do it Vince?  I mean  You were up against  This media conglomerate  Time Warner  You're up against  A billionaire  I mean  How could you possibly  Do this?  How could you possibly  Beat a billionaire?  Well  There's only one answer  To that  And that's  Become one 
[01:08:30]  Yourself  Geez  Not too modest  Is he?  You know a little insight  Anthony  Because we've been through this  Yeah  I don't even know  If anyone's going to care  But  Just to show you  How  Like kind of sad it is  For anyone that  Worked for the WCW  And having  Vince on your airwaves  You know  Talking about how  He just bought you  That's what happened  To us in Boston  With the company  We now work for  Oh yeah  We were at each other's  Throats in Boston  With WBCN  It was AF  Against BCN 
[01:09:00]  We hated each other  Kind of like WCW  And WWF  You know  And always going at each other  And one day  We get the word  That BCN bought us  Or BCN's parent company  Which is  You know CBS  CBS bought the station  We were working for  So then all of a sudden  They're like  Ha ha  They're on the air  We own you  They're on the air  Just rubbing it in  And there was nothing  We could do  It sucked  They sent a big  They sent a fax over to us  Big CBS sign  It said  Welcome home  Mother effers  Nice 
[01:09:30]  It wasn't fun  It sucked  We were so dejected  So we decided  To tell the town  The mayor died  In the car accident  We got out  Well you gotta understand  What it means  To be a competitor  Nobody understands that  Better than I do  Because you have to  Grab your competition  By the throat  And you gotta squeeze  The life  Out of your competition  Just like I did  To WCW  See now that 
[01:10:00]  Is the Vince character  But there's a lot  Of the real Vince  Coming through right there  You know what  I love that  You do have to  Just squeeze it out  Squeeze that  It's my good joke  Of the chicken  Yeah we can relate to that  We can relate to that  Steve what's going on  What's up  Hey  Yo like you said  Vince was you know  Just being Vince  But a lot of what he said  Was you know  True right  Oh yeah  But you know  I have a big problem  With him putting down  The Hulkster like that  The Hulkster  He's playing  He's so lame  He's already playing 
[01:10:30]  The storyline  I will bet  As much money  As you want to put up  That the Hulk  Is coming back  Very soon  That's right brother  Well will he be  In the ring  Doing that stupid  Leg drop or something  No but  But I mean  You know  They're great  At writing storylines  And they'll figure out  Something cool  For the Hulk  It would just be amazing  To see him that  Even if it's just  For a short time  You know  But yeah  He was making fun  Of the Hulk in the ring  Doing his moves  And stuff  That was really funny  Alright Steve  Thanks  What  What 
[01:11:00]  Did he curse  I don't even know  No  I think he just went  Scott what's up  What's going on  I wanted to know  With Vince McMahon  Like trying to trash  Ted Turner  And his network  And wrestling  Outfit there  I'm not really  Interesting that much  But I was wondering  Does Ted Turner  Really care that much  That he's losing  Of course not  His interest  No he doesn't care  Because I would think  With his baseball interest  And the overall  TNT network  That he owns  I think  That he really  Was like  Alright whatever  I'll come down 
[01:11:30]  And I'll sign the contract  Here you go  I think it's more  Of a big deal  To Vince  Than to Ted Turner  Okay I was just wondering  Because I  Knowing what Ted Turner  Has had in the past  I really don't think  That he would be  Too depressed  But it still makes  For great stuff  That is true  You know  Vince should just  Take it and ride it  And see what he can  Get out of it  And there you go  Alright man  Alright thanks a lot  Thank you  I don't care  I'm still making  Tons of money  With my god damn  Beverly Hillbillies rerun  You can't beat  The god damn  Beverly Hillbillies rerun 
[01:12:00]  Let's see  More Vince audio  Here he is  Gloating  I had a choice  To make tonight  That choice was  Coming here  Before you in Cleveland  And quite frankly  Gloating  Which I think  I'm doing a  Very good job  Of at the moment  Yeah  You know what  He didn't have to  Get into character  Last night  You know  He was just  Loving it  Yeah  How appropriate  Is it 
[01:12:30]  That  WCW's  Last broadcast  Is an appearance  Overhauled  How appropriate  Is that  Surrounded by  A bunch of  Beer drinking  Rednecks  There are obviously  A few here tonight  It's your audience  Vince  Jesus  See he's putting  Down the WCW  And you know  On their broadcast  Because they  Simulcasted this thing  Last night  That is just  Great to think  I mean you think 
[01:13:00]  If there wasn't  Some huge angle  To play there  He would just be  Bashing the league  He just fought  Yeah  No  It's about  The whole thing  With the battle  Of him and Shane  No it's amazing  With Vince McMahon  Too  Just when he thought  He was down and out  I mean  It's pretty obvious  The XFL's  Going to be off NBC  Very very soon  Really why  What happened  It looks like  Vince took a major hit  He turns around  Gets up like he said  In the interview  You know  Dusts himself off  And moves on  This is huge  I keep waiting  For the phone to ring  And XFL game day 
[01:13:30]  Is coming back  Yeah  Right Opie  This is huge  For business  Yeah  This is what he had  To say about  The wrestlers  At the WCW  But nonetheless  I've opted to come  Before you here  As opposed to  Walking in the ring  And lining  Each and every  One of those stars up  Every single one of them  So I can look  Right in their face  And say  Goldberg  Booker T 
[01:14:00]  And all the rest of them  To look him  Right in the face  And say  You're fired  The famous  Vince  You're fired  That is the best  You're fired  We just found  A brand new clip  That you'll hear  A thousand times  You're fired  Gary  Hey guys  What's going on  Love the show  Great road show  Last week  Yeah we rocked  I don't think  You're going to see  Goldberg  I think he's still hurting  And I think  He's just going to 
[01:14:30]  Sit back  At least for now  And take his money  I don't know about that  These guys want  The fame  Besides the fortune  They want the fame  True  And they know  What the WWF  Could deliver  And if he's injured  They'll still write him in  Somehow  True true  Did you guys catch  The last match  On WCW  Yeah with Ric Flair  And Sting  How pathetic was that  Oh god  It just looks  It was some guy  In his wacky Sting makeup  Beating up an old man  Helping him do every single move  Because Flair  Flair's like a decrepit old man already  Well they brought Flair back 
[01:15:00]  I guess  Right  Because he hasn't wrestled in a while  He hasn't fought in a while  He had his t-shirt on  Because God knows  What that body looks like  Yeah it was pretty sad  And then they shook hands  And that was it  That's the ending of WCW  As you know it  You think Vince may bring Sting over  I think so  Because there's not much  I mean if you go through the talent  There's not much  I mean all them young flying kids  He doesn't need them  No  They're all gone  He needs Goldberg  And the Puff Bagwell  He's just taking the stars  He's not going to be paying 
[01:15:30]  All those other slouches  Yeah because I don't know  If he's going to bring Steiner  Supposedly he can't stand Steiner  Well with Shane  Like taking over to WCW  We were talking about this  In the hall  With Ron and Fez  Who are huge wrestling fans  And they're in the building  And they want to come in  For the rest of this break  Come on in  They're saying like  Some of the wrestlers  That just aren't getting their time  In the WWF  But are pretty cool  Like Val Venus  And you know  A bunch of those guys  Right  They can move them over  To the you know  Wink wink nudge nudge  WCW league  That Shane is going to control  For a while 
[01:16:00]  True  And they'll get a hell of a lot more  You know air time and stuff  All this really amounts to  Is Shane  You know how they  Have their little factions  Yeah  You know that they come up  With a faction  And all of a sudden  It's you know like DX  There's a little faction of guys  And Shane is in charge  To one of these things  That's all WCW is now  True  It's another gang  So you're going to see people  From WWF  Going over to WCW  Even though  They're not really going over  To WCW  Yeah  That's true  This is how it's going to play out  It's pretty obvious 
[01:16:30]  Yeah  Shane controls the WCW  They're going to work the storyline  With the WCW wrestlers  As they are now  Okay  And then when that gets a little old  And tired out  You'll see some of the WWF wrestlers  Yeah  Well you're going to see stuff like  You know  Hey Vince  I can't stand you  Shane offered me more money  I'm going over to WCW  Right  Meanwhile they're not going anywhere  They're selling the WWF  But it's just to get the battle lines  Between Vince and Shane  So what do you think  The set up SummerSlam  Vince versus Shane  For total control  That you're going to say  And I discussed that  I think that's going to be 
[01:17:00]  At least a year away  Cool  They're going to play out  This angle for a while  And then you know  When it starts getting old  Yeah  They'll wrestle for control  Of the whole damn thing  Keep it up  You guys rock  Alright thank you  And that's exactly  What's going to happen  Because WCW  Is going on this shelf  It's going nowhere  WCW  Is buried  Buried  I deserve more respect  Than that  They're booing  Damn it 
[01:17:30]  I'm Vince McMahon  Damn it  I own WCW  I own the WWF  And you will treat me  With respect  And I'll walk out of this arena  Alright  So this is where it gets interesting  You want to like 
[01:18:00]  Fill everyone  In where we're at  Yeah  The simulcast  That was on WWF  And WCW last night  Yeah so Vince is there  In front of the WWF crowd  And he's spouting  Everything you've just heard  About how he owns  WCW  Blah blah blah  He's signing the contract  At Wrestlemania  To close the deal  And then  The music hits  And Shane  Starts making his way  Into the WCW ring  Right  During Nitro  Right  Which was simulcast  You know they're broadcast  At the same time  Vince left it  And he said that  He bought the WCW 
[01:18:30]  But it's not official  Because he's going to  Sign the contract  In front of Ted Turner  At Wrestlemania  Yeah so Shane comes out  And Vince makes that  Cartoon I'm Scared face  And the  And the exaggerated gulp  Yeah the gulp  He just  I think he got some pointers  On how to make that look  From Bob Costas  The other night  Just look like you're scared  S-less  And gulp  And this is what happened  Which was  A lot of fun  To check out last night  What's up Vince  Thanks  Surprise dad 
[01:19:00]  You're in Cleveland Ohio  And I'm here  In Panama City  Base Florida  Yeah cause when they  Played Shane's music  You know  Vince assumed  He was coming out  To meet him in the ring  And all of a sudden  He's on the big screen  And Vince is like  Where are you  And he's in Panama City  That's where  The WCW event  Was going on  So there's Shane  In a WCW ring 
[01:19:30]  Which is just  Ridiculous  Yeah  Cause they've been  On each other's throats  For so long  Picture us going  You know  Over to a certain station  Um  In this city  Picture that  That's what  That's what this was like  Well Anthony  Like hi  How you doing  As we saw last night  Anything is possible  Anything's possible  You're fine  No one's putting us  On the shelf  A phlegm contest 
[01:20:00]  Alright here's the  Announcement that just  Blew everyone away  Last night  The deal is finalized  With WCW  And the name  On the contract  Does say McMahon  However the contract  Reads  Shane McMahon  Oh my god  And then 
[01:20:30]  The face Vince made  What an actor  This guy is  He should have won  An academy award  Vince for his  Acting ability  He made the  Surprise look there  Where his eyes  Flew open  His mouth is agape  I was trying to figure out  How they were going to  Spin it last night  I really wasn't  Thinking the Shane angle  And that's just  It just sets off  For some great  Great storylines  In the coming months  And that was  Pretty much it  What Rick  I liked at the end  After Shane's done  Doing all his talking 
[01:21:00]  And Vince is walking  Around the stage  It's like he's a drunk  Staggering around  Looking for another drink  Or something  Yeah yeah  He left the ring  He just dropped the mic  And the ring  He's walking around like  But I  I owned the  The league  I was saying  I was going to sign  The contract  How did Shane  Get the  How did that happen  And then  Jeannie was there  And Major Nelson  But he's done it  To me again  West Coast Dave  Let's see what he has to say  West Coast Dave 
[01:21:30]  What's up guys  Hey  You know this whole  WWF buying the  WCW thing  Was a bad  Bad business move  WCW is a friggin hole  They were going to cancel it  It was losing  80 million dollars a year  No someone is going to buy it  He just bought his competition  How is that ever stupid  Why  Because  Why would he buy  A losing venture  Nobody was watching  They were going to cancel it  He liquidates it  And just makes it  A part of the WWF  So it's not really  WCW  Isn't really there  He eliminates his competition  He gets a couple of superstars 
[01:22:00]  People want to see  No but it was a waste of money  It was going to go away anyway  The competition was going to be gone  Anyhow  You hear me  The show was going to be cancelled  Dave we're hearing you  But if you want to argue this  Listen to us  Okay  Yeah the league did suck  The rating sucked  And it looked like it was going away  But someone was going to buy the WCW  And you don't know what they're going to do  They could have turned it around  And made it a huge money winner  Right  So instead  Vince buys his competition  So you're saying  Vince bought it to prevent  Somebody else from buying  Possibly  And now he gets to take  The superstars that matter  You know how hard it is  To build up a guy  From scratch 
[01:22:30]  To like a Goldberg  No I hear you  So and then  Alright say there's another league  That comes about  It's going to take years  For them to develop talent  Like Goldberg  And you know  Stone Cold  And The Rock  And Triple H  And the rest of them  I see what you're saying  It's brilliant  I don't know man  I'm not so sure about that  Between that and the XFL  I mean the XFL  Really just  Plus that  That kind of caused me  To lose faith in Vince  And his you know  Abilities I guess  Yeah but then he turns around  And does this  Yeah well I mean  I guess it's a good idea  Maybe it'll pan out  You've got to study the book of Vince 
[01:23:00]  I mean everyone thought  He was downed out in the early 90s  Yeah good point  You know this guy  Don't ever count him out  Yeah yeah  Alright well we'll see  And plus everyone's talking about it  In the wrestling circles  The storylines  I mean you watch  The pay-per-views  Are going to go through the roof now  Alright  Alright syndication soon  I bet suck  I bet this is going to be  The biggest pay-per-view  They've ever had  Coming up Sunday  I bet this is the biggest  The largest audience  Pay-per-view  That they've ever had  For WWF

[01:29:00]  That was premature  Gotta save that one  The O&A show  212-757-1027  Dennis Leary and Adam Farrar from The Job  Will be in studio in a few minutes  Black Earl in the studio  Black Earl  Getting into playing the PlayStation 2 after the show aren't you  Yeah get Stink back in here  I forgot the game already  Short term memory problem  What is it?  Tech and tag  Yeah I'm just  I'm still on ColecoVision 
[01:29:30]  So I'm just learning how to play PlayStation  ColecoVision  Are you trying to do a little joke or not?  No I'm just  That's how far behind I am on video games  Do you still play ColecoVision?  No  So you're doing a little joke  Remember the ColecoVision basketball?  With the jumping bouncing guy  And the square ball  I don't know how you'd play that  I believe Earl was doing some of that exaggerated humor  Was that it?  I still got the ColecoVision  And what do we want to ask him? 
[01:30:00]  Why he doesn't pick the black guy?  Yeah why he ever picked the black guy?  I don't know who any of the characters are  So I'm just like randomly picking characters  I think you'd pick the black guy though  Because you know you relate to him more  Being a black guy  I didn't even know there was a black guy  Why wouldn't you want to pick  Hey Tony Soprano  Come on  Why wouldn't you want to pick the black guy  To try to kick the white guy ass?  I didn't know there is a black guy  If I'd known that I would pick him 
[01:30:30]  Now you're going to use the black guy  I know why  Because you don't want to look bad to your community  Because you know you're going to get your ass kicked  And you don't want to be a black guy getting his ass kicked  I think he does kick my butt  Very consistently  He's like 15 and 0 against me  People do pick the characters that they can relate to  You know what I mean  Right?  That's why  You know when they're into online gaming and stuff  They give you a whole choice of character faces and bodies and what not  You know I wouldn't think of picking the black guy  I can't relate to the black guy  Is there a black guy in Mafia mode? 
[01:31:00]  No it's not graphics based  But any of the other games  I make the black girl in my little Sims game  Because the Sims got pretty boring  Yeah  I made her the hooker  Did you?  Oh yeah  Comes over and services my guy  In the vibrating bed  Really?  Oh yeah  It's kind of hot  In a twisted way  Because my guy is as wise as they come  With the horn-rimmed glasses 
[01:31:30]  And a nice little neat suit and stuff  And his wife's all kind of boring  Nothing really going on there  Short hair  Sweater on  You know  So she leaves to go to work?  Oh yeah  And I call up the hot black hooker  With the midriff showing and the big boobs  Yeah  And yeah  She goes upstairs and services him and stuff  Nice  And then he goes off to work  Oh yeah  I love stereotyping  It's fun  Yeah how much does that hooker cost on the Sims  I give her a gift 
[01:32:00]  Oh a gift?  Yes  Alright  She hooks you up  Nice  Just so I feel like I'm paying for it  Do you slap her?  I know you can slap  No but the  You gotta smack that bitch  Sometimes the wife's around and she doesn't like her  So she'll slap her a little bit  She pimp slaps her?  Yeah  Nice  Yes  Manny's very pissed off  What's the matter?  Manny  Yo what's up fellas?  Hey Manny how are you?  I'm fine  You know who this is right on  Of course I do  What's up?  Yo what's up man?  It's been a long time 
[01:32:30]  What you mean oh  Yeah it's been a long  I still listen every day  Cool  Since you fagged at that erotica fest  With the guy with the big junk  Erotica fest big  What are you talking about?  I'm confused  That's the first show I listened to you guys  Like three and a half  Oh my  The guy that had the junk that hung down to his knee?  Yeah  Yeah that was out there man  I guess that makes me a fag too  Cause I listen  Nah  Hey what y'all mean that Earl should pick the black dude?  The black dude sucks in that game  The Brazilian break dancer?  Yeah it's the Brazilian break dancer  Yeah come on man  Can't nobody win with him man  I got second tag too man 
[01:33:00]  Alright wait Stig go  The black guy is the best  Like anyone that plays a game  You're not allowed to pick him  Cause you could just  Kill everybody  Really  Hey Stinky  Yeah  Stinky  That tells me you're an amateur dog  You're an amateur man  Oh yeah  That dude is for people that don't know how any moves  You can just dance around and kick ass with him  Yeah you can just dance around  You can dance around  That character is meant to just look scary  So you don't want to mess with him  I'll take the chink and kick everyone's ass  How about that?  They're pretty good  So the intimidation factor works also in gaming world 
[01:33:30]  Exactly  So all of a sudden you're up against the black guy  And you're like uh oh  I forgot all my moves  The black guy  Ah why?  Wait hold on hold on hold on  You gotta say I'm an a-hole  Oh I'm sorry  For some reason they don't like that other version of that word  Oh my fault  Which is too bad  I can say chink but I can't say ass  Grab this one  Yeah the race thing's fine  Just don't say the a-hole  Yeah you can say chink  You can't say it  Hey when you guys gonna let me see uh  Meet Vinny the white cracker 
[01:34:00]  The white racist  Yeah the racist  That would be an interesting conversation  Me and him got a lot in common man  I hate white people just as bad as you hate everybody else  You know what I'm talking about  Is Vinny a big guy?  Yeah he's pretty big  Big uh  Oh man I don't know if I want to meet him then  I want to meet a skinny small racist white guy  Work your way up just like the game you know  Just like the Sims man  I'm starting out as a cat burglar  Beat him up  And we just think uh Earl  Is um 
[01:34:30]  Hey I'm kind of pissed off  Self-hating black  I'm kind of pissed off that the cat burglar's white in the Sims game  Yeah that's post  I mean uh  That is  That's his foul man  Yeah  That's his foul  I'm trying to catch  You know it's been a while since I've been on the phone fellas  And the Gardner's not Mexican  What the hell is that about?  The Gardner's white too  You know what that means  That means everyone in the game is white man  This is your world  O&A  You guys are white guys and that's what the world is about  One black guy on second tag  No if it  Wait if it was our world in the Sims  The maid that comes by every day 
[01:35:00]  She'd be like Puerto Rican  The Gardner would be Mexican  The cat burglar would be black  And the whores would be uh  Black  And the rapist would be black  All he is is no rapist in the Sims  You gotta create him man  And then when you turn your Sims guy into the serial killer dude  You gotta make him white of course  Yeah  I understand  Well I see you guys are still facts  Hey what do you think about the fact that only the white kids are shooting up the schools?  Oh I think that's pretty you know  Cause white guys they can't really beat any black guys up 
[01:35:30]  The black guys is roughing them up in school  You know they can't do nothing about it  So what they do they go home and build a bomb  Black guys just kick ass in the lunch line  Take your lunch card  We don't care  That's why people like Vinny the Race  Gotta get on the phone and you know call in and plan strategies  I just go out in the streets  Hey hey cracker get out my way  Yeah the black school kids don't let the you know it build up inside  And I got another bone to pick with you  They take care of business yeah  You remember how you said um  Every time you guys go to the movie theater black people are allowed? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah  That's Anthony's bed yeah  Listen why don't y'all tell people to shut the eff up?  That's what I do  Oh yeah yeah  And then it turns into a fight  Well look next time you go to the movies bring me  I bet you won't have no problems about it  See it's a race thing  Man I'll be the first one to admit that  There's a lot of black people out there that quite frankly intimidate me  And then if you say uh  Hey excuse me  You can even be nice  Excuse me uh could you keep it down  Keep it down  I pay just like you did mother effer  What you gonna tell me to shut up  I tell you to shut up  I watch the goddamn movie any way I please 
[01:36:30]  And you're sitting there like  And then all of a sudden  You know your head starts thinking these things  These stereotypes  And you go huh  What are you supposed to say?  Okay I appreciate the um African uh uh gentleman's um take on this whole thing  And I'll just let them talk  No you go effing and won't shut the hell up  Right  Oh I don't know about all that  You do  That's what you say?  Absolutely  Man if you said that to me I'd chop your head off  I say it to myself  Omni Moucher style 
[01:37:00]  I say it in my head  He says it yeah under his breath  As I run to get the uh owner of the theater to please have me move  I mean that happens to me too  That happens to me with black kids man  I tell them to shut the eff up  A moulin yarn  Moulin yarn  Oh you've seen that episode  I didn't like that  Tony Soprano  It's charcoal briquette  I would have smacked Tony's uh mafia ass  Charcoal briquette  He's teaching us new words  That's not good  I thought I heard them all until I heard charcoal briquette 
[01:37:30]  But now the whole thing of this is  I think Earl is a self-hating black man  I do too  Remember I told him that when I was on the uh on the show  Yes you did man  He doesn't pick the black characters  He's the whitest black guy I've ever met in my life  We've all said that  I used to be intimidated by Earl when I first met him  I'm like oh man  Because he wears black all the time  Yeah  That just makes it worse  He's a white acting black guy that wears all black  Yeah he's trying to make believe he's like Malcolm X or something  Yeah I mean what is he a cat burglar  A fag cat burglar walking around 
[01:38:00]  Why don't you steal something man  And then uh you know when we were in the office in the back  And um something happens on the news  And they show a couple of black guys being coughed  And thrown in the cop car and stuff  What does Earl say?  What do you say?  Another set of dumb ass niggas  Oh lord  What makes it so bad?  This guy works on the weekend playing rock music  Why don't you work at Hot 97 part time or something man?

[01:46:30]  We're in that bar area  Upstairs  Before we all go over  Were you naked  Not that time  No  We're in the bar area  Adam's hanging out with me  You guys are talking  To a press  About the TV show  And what not  Right  So Adam's going to  Bring me over  And introduce me  To you  And you're speaking  To some guy  From a newspaper  So Adam gets pulled away  Right  To talk to another  Newspaper  Right  In that time  You get freed up  I say  Who needs Adam  I'll go over to Dennis 
[01:47:00]  I'll say Dennis  Anthony from the  Opium Anthony show  I'm a good friend  To Adam Ferraris  Just you know  Maybe straight  Just hello  How you doing  Blah blah blah  What happened  The probably  And this was witnessed  By a lot of people  Which made it even worse  We all had to turn around  Probably  The ultimate blow off  I've ever  Not only gotten  But seen anyone  Get in my life  You did this  You went like this  Eh  And what  You kind of  Your hand kind of  I wasn't sure  If it was a fake gesture  Or a shake of hand 
[01:47:30]  Or a like push me away  Kind of thing  Like eh  Okay  I'd say it was probably  A push me away  Was it a push me away  Kind of thing  I don't remember  But I'm just assuming  So and then  I look around  And everyone like  Looked at me real quick  But then turned away  Really fast  Like oh my god  Oh my god  Did he get blown off  So severe  Way down  You lost friends  Because of the episode  Oh yeah  Oh it was horrid  Wow  I didn't just look  People turned away  They shunned  They did not want to look  At the embarrassment  That I had gotten  I'm glad I could bring 
[01:48:00]  That much  That one little brush with fame  I'm glad that you have  That story to tell  You see  Now I have that story  You have that story to tell  So when we heard  You were coming in  Everybody's like  Anthony if you pussy out  And don't tell him  About what happened  Yeah because he told  The story on the air  And he felt  Kind of bummed  I was like oh my god  I got bummed  And then you know  I want to get on  And trash the show  And then my pal's on  And then it turns out  That it's good  So I just  I was screwed  Through this whole thing  I got screwed  You can't win 
[01:48:30]  He was just looking  For an opening  Hoping the show sucks  And then we can  You know  Trash those things  There's so many  Every time you turn around  When you're at one of these  Press things  Especially for a charity  You know  There's some guy  That wants to come up  And say something  And I was that guy  Or have you a picture  Taken with his fat girl  I should have waited  For Adam  You should have waited  For Adam  See  You had your entree  Right  Because then you  Identify him  From across the room  Hey he's with a good guy  Bring him on  Yeah  But Dennis  Here's the difference  Anthony had a really good part  Oh yeah  But I don't smoke weed  Neither do I 
[01:49:00]  Opie  Thanks  Well next time  Crack a beer with you  Make sure you have Adam with you  I have to have Adam with you  Leave the pot home  Bring me  Here's the scene  I'll work it out in my head  It's like  Alright  No he's been on the show  Now he knows me  I don't need Adam  Dennis how you doing  Yeah  Son of a bitch  We've seen that happen  We interview people  And we're like  Wow we're pals now  And they're all big  We'll see  Oh yeah  He had such a good time  Right  I'm on to the next radio station 
[01:49:30]  Kid  Leave me alone  Well I'm sorry  That that part of your life  Was such a crushing blow  But next year  Come up and try again  The show was good though  Wasn't it  It was  Really good  Adam was great on that show  The comics come home  Rocked  And the job is really really good  Mike what's going on  Yeah I want to ask Dennis a question  And Adam a question  First of all Dennis  Do you sniff the chair  Every time Elizabeth Hurley  Gets up when she does the show  That's a really classy thing to ask  Jesus  You notice I took the K out  You put the K in between  The A and the S 
[01:50:00]  But I  No I don't  Quite frankly  Oh man  You're missing out  Hey Adam  Which way  Medium or well done  Yeah okay  He's missing out  Because he's not sniffing C's  Mike  Hey Adam  Yeah  Which way  Medium or well done  Thanks Mike  He's doing dice bits  Mike's trying to be funny  In front of him  Where is Mike  He's gone now  Yeah  Matt what's going on  Hey Dennis  Yes  I just want to say that  That show is unbelievable  Thank you  And I also wanted to say that  If anybody 
[01:50:30]  Everybody listening out there  Who doesn't have your  Two CDs  You've got to go out  And get them now  I love this guy  Unbelievable  Oh thank you Mike  And I just want to know  If you were ever going to do that  You know  Thinking about doing stand up again  Well I'll tell you what  There might be a strike this summer  The actors are going on a strike  Supposedly I guess in June  Uh oh  And it looks like it's going to happen  If that happens  I'm going to be off  So I might actually take the summer  And go back on tour  Yeah does the comics come home  Every year  Yeah well the comics come home  To benefit the Neely Foundation  Which helps kids with cancer  Every fall  I believe this fall 
[01:51:00]  We will be back on Comedy Central  So  Nice  But I might see you on tour  This summer  You never know  Oh great great  Thanks  Take care guys  What kind of an effing curse is that  The show just gets rolling  And they're going to strike  Oh please  It's everybody though  It's the movies and everything  Scab  Just scab it  How long do you think  Cross the picket line  I'll tell you who I blame  Tom Hanks  Tom Hanks  I don't know why  I just do  You've got to blame him  I'm not thinking  He's a big shot  He's got two Oscars  He almost had a third one  Why can't he go and fix it  You know  Yeah  What's the problem  What are their problems now  What's got to be addressed 
[01:51:30]  Well I guess  It's complicated  It's the writers and the actors  But it's  It comes down basically to the future  It's like the baseball strike  It's like the future in residuals  And you know  Instead of free agency  It's dealing with how much  Money you can chase  It's not going to have to do with you guys  I don't know  Hey I want to keep working  Don't worry about the show being a hit  Oh please  I've been walking in a circle for a week  Just pacing  Smoking  Cursing  I don't know what the hell  You look different than your normal life  Really  I blame A-Rod  Adam before a gig  Me too  I blame A-Rod  He started this whole thing  Yeah he did  He did 
[01:52:00]  Now last year at the comics come home  Yeah  That woman comic that came out  With the god damn sandwich  And wanted Cam to eat it  I'm sitting there horrified  Cam did not want to do this  No I don't blame her  This big woman  Big  She said she would give like 20 bucks or 100 bucks to the charity  It was a gag  What she should have done is said  Come on Cam eat the sandwich  We just got a big laugh  When he first refused it  And then  Move on  If you're an experienced comic  You move on to your next bit  She kept pounding 
[01:52:30]  And finally I had to come out  And take a bite  Now when you did that  I almost puked  Yeah but there was no way  She had that thing down her shirt  I know there was no way out  I had to do it  And you know that under boob area  There's no wash in that right there  I had to take one for the team  You did  I was standing backstage  She's not going to stop  I'm going to have to eat this guy  My partner Serpico  Who produces the show  Came up to me  He goes  What are we going to do  I said I got to go out  I got to eat the sandwich  I got to eat the sandwich  And he goes  Yep  I'll see you in about two minutes  And I walked out and ate it  Sometimes for comedy 
[01:53:00]  It's like being at war  It's like you got to  Dive on the ground  A fun for the team  They call it  I didn't get in there  Nope  No  I ain't eating a musky baloney  Yeah everybody left  The backstage area  After about the first 30 seconds  Of her forcing cam  Well you put me up after  And I had to follow  The sweaty sandwich bit  Yeah but you killed  Yeah but that's where  You could kill  Just the fact that  You didn't weigh 4,000 pounds  Maybe  That was kind of  Night more pleasant  To be eyeing  That body  Let's go  Is he going to do  A sandwich bit  Then the skinny prick  Yeah  Hey Dan what's going on  Hey how's it going guys 
[01:53:30]  Listen I caught Adam's show  The other night  At Rascal's  Yeah  I wanted to ask him  For a refund  I'm sorry  I got my phone beeping  I want to ask him  If he remembers  The lady getting pissed off  About him smoking  Yeah  And because my sister  Gave you the cigarette  Oh yeah  And then that lady  Did you see how pissed she was  I know  She wrote a note  I wanted to  Oh did she  Yeah she wrote a note  To the back  You know you did  A whole routine about  Like quitting smoking  Yeah  She did  Her face was so  Like she wanted to kill you  I know 
[01:54:00]  What is she doing in the club  I don't know  Really right  I don't know  I was just  I was doing this thing  I was smoking  And I lit a cigarette  And hey hey hey  And so I put it out  What  From the back of the  It was a non-smoking night  What do you mean  It was a non-smoking night  A non-smoking night  Yeah I didn't know  But you were doing  A smoking bit  Wait wait  You were on stage smoking  And the lady got pissed  I lit a cigarette on stage  And she got pissed  You should have went  Into the urination bit  Yeah  We all did a golden show  Invite her to my next tour  By the way  She's going to have  A really good time  I like that  Because we all smoke  On the set  And there was like  A couple of prop ladies 
[01:54:30]  That's right  Yeah  And Dennis gave her  A look that could  Like kill a plan  No and but the best part  Was Lenny said to her  Hey sweetheart  You're out of a job  If you stop  Don't stop complaining  And she stopped complaining  Because she needed the job  But she'd come in  Yeah you got seven actors  They all smoke  Never mind the crew  Well we were smoking  Before you showed up  We had a scene  Before you showed up  And she like coughed  And I lit a cigarette  And Lenny goes  Lenny goes  Alright wait for Dennis  To get here  And then you showed up  And she  I love this whole thing  People with the cab drivers  And the people on planes 
[01:55:00]  I'm 44 years old  Okay  Nobody was allergic to smoking  Until about what  Eight years ago  They started getting PC about it  You can't be allergic to smoke  You can die from it  But you can't be allergic to smoke  Okay  It's two different things  So just say that  It's killing me  Good  It's killing me too  You know  That's good  Barbie  Hey Barbie  Barbie  Hey Dennis  Are you a dancer  I'm a  No  You're really named Barbie  Yes I swear  What's your full actual name  Barbara  Oh 
[01:55:30]  Okay  But Dennis  I'm a big fan of yours  Two things  Every Christmas now  Tradition to watch the rest  Like 50 times  Oh good  And I just wanted to ask you  Is hell still orange  Plaid bell bottoms  And shadow dancing  All day  Piped in  Yeah I'd say pretty much  I think you could probably  Throw Ricky Martin  Into that mix  And it's non-smoking  Yeah and it's probably  Non-smoking  And it's non-smoking  It's probably non-smoking  Let's be honest  When are you going to do  Another HBO special  I don't know  I was just saying  I might do it this summer  If we go to the actors  I'm supposed to go on strike 
[01:56:00]  I might go on tour  If I have that down time  Because I'm not  Great  I'll go back to Denny's  That is just your  Effing luck  Adam  You realize him being on the show  Is why there's going to be a strike  Thanks  I don't understand it  No  No  It was going to happen anyway  Like I said  Wasn't a strike  Trying to happen  One of those lousy pilots  You were making Adam  I think Tom Hanks  Wants a vacation  That's what I think  Oh man  That's good  Reggie  Reggie what's up  Yeah hi  What's up guys  Hello Dennis  Yeah 
[01:56:30]  How are you man  I'm good man  I was able to catch your show  Last week  For the first time  With Elizabeth Hurley  Yeah  And I saw  When your character went home  Your wife was mad at you  Yeah  And then you went out  And you went to a black chick's house  And was that your mistress  That's my girlfriend  Yeah  Your girlfriend  Yeah  That's the girl from  Fresh Prince of Bel-Air  Yeah  She's hot  She's a great actress  Yeah  That's why I wanted to ask  You guys have a good day  Okay  Alright  So did you guys tell me  We would clarify things  On the show  Yeah 
[01:57:00]  Clarification hotline  Yeah  Are you guys cops or something  Yeah  You guys are waving badges  Are you cops  You want to explain the job  For the newbies  I mean it's a show  I think you guys should check out  Yeah  It's a sitcom  Only in the sense  That it's 30 minutes long  It's weird though  Because it has the feel  Like it should be an hour long  Yeah it does  Because it has that cop show feel  Our goal is to make people laugh  And hopefully that's what  They're doing every weekend  Except it's reality based  It's shot with one camera  On location  So we've set out 
[01:57:30]  To make a show  That would make us laugh  That also didn't necessarily  Look like something else  On television  I think we succeeded in that  But I also think  We lucked out  I mean the people in the cast  Adam obviously  And Lenny  And Diane Farr  And John Ortiz  These guys are all hilarious  And Keith David  You know  And one of the best writers  In television  Peter Toll  And the guy did Larry Sanders  So look  I'm going to be honest with you  Okay  I can't swear  But I'm going to be honest with you  I think it's the best show  On television  If you want to laugh  You can say balls right 
[01:58:00]  Because that's what we set out  To do every week  And I don't know about you  But I used to sit home  And watch almost every other show  And go  This is not funny  Even the shows I had friends on  I'm not laughing  Yeah  So I think  I'm going out of my way  To watch the show  Yeah hopefully you can sit and laugh  And you know  I can't do the sitcoms anymore  I can't do the cop shows  But this show  I'm something about it  Yeah I mean  I'm going to make you laugh out loud  And you're pushing the envelope too  I mean everyone was talking  About all the words  You got on TV last week  You got the T word  For brass on the air  Yeah  You can't say that  On the radio anymore 
[01:58:30]  For some reason  You can't say that  You say it on our show  At 9.30  Yeah  Which is amazing  And we say it a lot  You got the T word on  You got balls  Yeah  Wait to see what comes up  In the next four weeks  Really?  Yeah  Well it's some stuff that  Even I can't believe  We get to do it  The big C word  You know  The big C  That's the goal  That's the goal  That's the goal  Hey we'd sweep  Hey we beat you  Dennis we beat you to that  We got the C word on TV  You got it in the newspaper  Oh yeah  How'd you do that?  It became a huge story 
[01:59:00]  All over the country  Some poor news woman  On Channel 4  Was doing a live shot  Out in Times Square  Oh that's right  I heard about this  We ambushed the reporters  When they're on the street  With a sign  Dropped the A-bomb  Held the sign  See you next Tuesday  Right there  Wow  And she was just horrified  And if that isn't bad enough  The next day  It's in the newspaper  Her picture  Page three  Post  Yeah  All over the other day  They took one letter out  Yeah they kind of pixelated it  No they had the C  And then everything else  Was yeah fuzzed out  Yeah  But you can figure it out  Because that is the word man  And by the way  You know I'm Irish 
[01:59:30]  Oh really?  Yeah my parents come from Ireland  And that's a  You know over in Ireland  In England  That word is used for everything  In Australia  An adverb  It's a descriptive noun  Yeah  It's everything you could want it to be  And everybody uses it  Mothers, fathers, kids  Teachers  Over here it's the showstopper  In a fight  It's the showstopper  You know what  Some little old Italian lady  I think  Started it  Said nobody's allowed to say that word anymore  And that was the beginning of the day  And now we can't use it  Because you're in an argument  No matter what level your argument's at  Oh yeah  If you say under your breath 
[02:00:00]  You eff and see  Right  What?  But they can say anything to us  Oh yeah  Yeah nothing hurts us  Sends the rules  Yeah I want that word  We gotta start a campaign  Bring it back  Maybe we start another  Charitable foundation  Okay  We start one  You know for that word  Save the sea  Yeah save the sea  Save the sea  Yeah  I'm in  Save the sea  I think we can work with that  Yeah  One thing  Because if you're losing  The argument you're in  Great t-shirts  Great t-shirts  You're losing the argument you're in  And you pull that out  Right  The argument you're in  Is forgotten about 
[02:00:30]  Oh completely  Because then it's replaced by this  Like that  So sometimes  How dare you use better words  You have to get through  The mushroom cloud  Yeah  And sift through the wreckage  You know after this show  I'm gonna go get a  Save the sea shirt  You have to now  I remember being in Ireland  One time with my cousin Mahal  In a very crowded pub  And there was an American girl  And of course everybody  Was saying that word  In various  You know  They just say it over there  They just say it all the time  But you know  People describe my car  My  I can't say the word  My blanking car broke down  You know  So this American girl  Walks up and she goes  You know excuse me 
[02:01:00]  I'm here for three weeks  On vacation  And I am really already tired  Of hearing that word  And he said  Too bad you're gonna be here  For another three weeks  Yeah  And we're not putting  The cigarettes out  That's right  In Ireland  Everybody smokes  Everyone wants to say  Hi to Dennis Leary  Stan what's up  Yeah Dennis  Stan  Yeah  Stan the man  I read your article  In GQ this month  What  I read your article  In GQ this month  Oh yeah the thing  About the skating rink  Yeah  Yeah  Do you get any of the top names  Like Mario Lemieux  And them to come over  And play with you  Well we were gonna do that  This year 
[02:01:30]  But Mario went back  To playing full time  But I actually want to do  A kind of  Of the dreams thing  With Gretzky  And Bobby Orr  And hopefully Mario  At some point  Coming out to my rink  You got your own rink  I have my own rink  It's not an indoor rink  It's an outdoor rink  I put up every winter  They could probably get  The Islanders to show up  At your house  You get what  Like candy  Well we played them  We beat them  Seven nothing  We only had four guys  Don't mess with my Islanders  Man  I've been a tough few years  And you know what  The guy who can take  The most blame  Is a former Bruin  Mike Mulberry 
[02:02:00]  Yes  You know  It's just you got  They have done nothing  For years  They're trying  And this is one of the top  At one time  Top franchises  In all the sports  Right  It's just  You ranger fans  Shut up  Nothing's going on  There either  Right now  Nothing's going on  With the Bruins either  Go bees  Go bees  Right  And how's no  Do we have you  For a few more minutes  Or what are you going to do  Yeah we've got plenty of time  Alright cool  We're hanging with  Dennis Leary  And Adam Ferrara  From The Job  It's on ABC  930  Wednesday nights  Right after Drew Carey  We highly recommend  You check out the show

He was having like a friendly meeting  With Joel Silver  Who still likes Dice  And Dice was walking out  And he said  I'll tell you  I'll tell the story 
[02:05:30]  About Dice after that  But he said  I said what are you doing  What are you up to?  He said you know  This is when he was  Going to do that sitcom  Remember?  Which one?  The one where he changed  His name  Remember he changed his name?  Was that it?  I'm Andrew Clay now  No more Dice  That's what he told me  He was like  I'm changing my name  I was like  To what?  And I thought  He's met like  Something like  A completely different name  Like Andrew Clay  And I was like  Yeah okay  Good luck  Run with it  He said something to me  One time  When I first broke  And I was going  In like my first photo shoot  For No Cure for Cancer 
[02:06:00]  With the guys  From the band  And stuff  But I had done a movie  My first movie  Was in the can  And I guess  It had been in the press  But I was  Signed up for another movie  Which was The Ref  I'm walking  And he's walking out  And he goes  Let me tell you something kid  That acting thing  It's a dead end  And I was like  Yeah  Okay  I'll talk to you later  You know  Now he's going to call  Because he's got someone  That listens to our show  Every day  To make sure we call  Love Soda Kenny  Don't talk like that  About the legend  It'll happen  What are you and Jay Morgan

[02:07:30]  Kind of the same thing  You would do in a bar  Yeah for four hours a day  That's so good  The show started today  Because a girl  In that window over there  Was taking a show  So for 20 minutes  Our show was just us  Describing what she was doing  That's what we do  Gawking  We had to get a couple  Of mics hooked up  How long have you guys  Been here  Almost three  And the first time  You've seen a girl  Taking a shower over there  A couple of times  The show's been too busy  So we can't really  Take a look  Is she new  We've never seen this girl  This girl was very attractive  An eight or a nine  No joking  Really  Solid  Soaping up 
[02:08:00]  So we're just describing  Now she's shooting this  Now she's cleaning that  It was hilarious  For 20 minutes  That's how the show  What time was that  Right at three  Yeah three  She was just going to work  And just getting up  I don't know  That's what we're trying  To figure out  Her schedule  We're thinking she was  Getting ready for happy hour  You guys got to get  One of those telescopes  Oh yeah  With the camera  Everything  It's right there though  Yeah I know  40 50 feet  I'd have binoculars  I'd get the eye surgery  You guys got to keep us  Up to date on this  Of whether or not  It happens again and again  Deal  Oh yeah  You better come back  I'd come back  Most people say  Yeah I will be back

[02:14:00]  You skate three or four times a week  Really?  If I'm home in New York  If I'm in L.A.  Now this is real hockey  Where people are hitting each other  Yeah  Good old-fashioned  Old-school hockey  What's the worst injury  You've had from it?  Last year I broke my shoulder  Right before I started the movie  Nice  Which was bad  Sorry  Nice  Yeah, I mean  It's just one of those things  Who do you play with?  I play with various guys  Tim Robbins plays  He's good  There's a lot of actors  We play  A lot of ex-hockey players  Cam Neely  They treat you good  Or is it like  Hey, I'm going to slam 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, it's guys  You start out like  I have a rink at my house  I put up every winter  An outdoor rink  And you start out  Every morning  The same way  On Saturday morning  You know, 12 guys show up  And some kids  And it starts out  Okay, here's the rules  And it's a friendly game  And within an hour  People are, you know  Breaking a fight  And, you know  Hitting each other with sticks  Who's McSorley?

[02:15:00]  Look, hockey's about several things  And two of those things  Are beer and Zambonis  Okay, so that's the way it goes  Drink while you play?  Zamboni  It's a beer  We don't drink while  That's not allowed  No  The guys I play with  They're just  If they had booze in them  Forget it  So, you can drink  The rule is  You can drink as soon as  We're done playing  But, you know  Whenever's a new guy  He always comes down  With a cooler full of beer  We go  Yeah, after the game  Okay?  Not now  Right  Because we don't wear helmets  Or anything, you know  Yeah  It's really old school  I was going to say old school  Yeah  Jesus  Has Adam played on? 
[02:15:30]  I ain't playing  What are you  I'll drive the Zamboni  You see the way he walks?  You're going to make him skate?  The guy can't even walk right  You've got to be kidding me  What's wrong with his walking  He's got that no funny walk  From his throat plate  You know, that's the result  Of a major injury he had  When he was a kid  His father had him  With a sledgehammer  Dented part of his brain  And he had it coming  You guys saw  And for that day  The garbage never was not  Picking out after that  The ball peen hammer  I think  That's funny  Poor guy  I think we have to get  Dennis out of here

[02:22:30]  Who could forget?  Abigail  Hey, guys  Hey  What's up?  Long time no talk  Yes, Abigail was the 16-year-old beauty  I had two weeks until I was 17  Wait, you're going to be 17?  We're getting closer  Remember Abigail?  She sent us the pictures of her  Not naked  She's fully clothed  She's just wearing like a little top  And a thong panty type thing  And she was  But when she was 16  So we were very nervous 
[02:23:00]  About having her involved in the show  Or anything else  And she is turning 17  Now, what can we get away with  With a 17-year-old girl?  You know, ironically enough  I have lost the week of my birthday  So I was hoping maybe I could come into the studio  How's that?  Now, when is your birthday?  I know we have the countdown clock  I think it's still running on Foundry  But it's impossible to find  April 14th  I don't think it's easy to throw something  April 14th?  Yeah  April 14th  And I have up that whole week  So if you guys want me to come into the studio  I can be in there any day 
[02:23:30]  You may be able to throw  Yeah, a teen birthday party  For Abigail  Who's turning 17  Birthday party  Can we find out the laws?  We really need a lawyer to call in  We're always confused  Is it 17?  Is it 18?  What is it?  We actually had somebody fax us the state statute  Yeah, but it's state statute  So they fax on sex and stuff  We need to know  That is how old a girl has to be  To be photographed topless  Period  17  As long as she's 17 
[02:24:00]  I'm not going to listen to you, Rick  This is like a serious  Right  Right  I'm not going to just take your word  It's not my word  I read it from the state thing  Whatever it is  It's my word?  I haven't talked to you guys in a while  I changed a little bit  I cut my hair short again  Well, we need new pictures  Well, maybe I'll send you some  I got the tongue pierced now  I got that done  Oh, you did?  Uh-huh  Stay away from the nips  The nip pierced  Don't get those nips pierced  No, the tongue is the only thing that I've wanted done  So I got that done 
[02:24:30]  And now I'm good  Anything else?  No, just my ears  All right, hold on  Your ear?  My ears  My ears pierced  My tongue pierced  All right, Abigail  Hold on a second  I got to talk to Jimmy  Jimmy, what's up?  Jimmy  Hello  You got info?  Yeah  What's the info?  The old man's a police officer  And I was told New York State is 17 years old  For what?  For consent  Consent to what?  Consent of being of legal age  For what?  For everything  For everyone, I guess  No, there's not a for everything  I know legal age for sex is 17 
[02:25:00]  Legal age for pictures  I think is 18  And drinking is 21  So you're saying consent of what?  See, no one knows  We need an expert  I'm thinking if you're a 21-year-old guy  And you're dating a 17-year-old  It's okay in New York State  Like you can't go to jail for anything  We need a little more help than this  Sorry, guys  Thank you  You can't  I need to see something in writing 
[02:25:30]  Right  And not on a warrant  Someone's saying sex at 17  Good  Photograph nude at 18  Good  Photograph nude at 18  Photograph nude at 17  Bad  I  Sex at 17  Good  Always  Always  Rick  Jesus  I don't know  Abigail 
[02:26:00]  Abigail  Yes  We'll have to get back to you  But we're going to figure this out, okay?  Okay  I think you could be the next teen party, though  Yeah?  We're getting ready to do teen four  Okay  Teen four, Abigail's birthday party  Okay, sounds good  All right  All right  When you guys figure that out  I'll get a studio call  We got your info?  I think so, yeah  Rick's saying no  Hold on  All right, talk to Abigail  Set up a party  Oh, Tom is a lawyer  All right  Let's hear from Tom the lawyer  Tom? 
[02:26:30]  Hi, guys  What kind of lawyer are you?  I do a little bit of everything  But I do a great deal of criminal work  And I can tell you  The age of consent for sexual relations is 17  But the age of consent for contracts  Which is kind of what you're doing here  Model releases and so on  Is 18  That's what I heard  Look at me, it breaks my heart  At least as much as yours  What if Abigail is in the studio  For her teen birthday party  And she's wearing just a nice bikini  But everyone else around here is naked  And doing lesbian stuff  She's not naked, that's cool  As long as everybody else is 18 or older 
[02:27:00]  But there are releases  You know what I mean?  We might have to go to our actual  We have to go to our lawyers  We're going to have to go to our lawyers  She doesn't have the capacity  To sign a release for that  Until she's 18  But I don't know about that either  Because I've seen releases  That are signed by girls  For TV shows and whatnot  That are younger than that  People that are in the background of videos  Sometimes on news videos and whatnot  Or those reality shows  Like cops and stuff  They're on there  And they had to sign releases  To get on there 
[02:27:30]  That's right  But that's not sexuality  Well we're not talking  It's not sexual relations  But nudity  That makes the difference  Uh huh  Alright  Thank you Tom  Alright guys, good luck  It's obviously a question for our lawyers  But coming soon  After vacation Anthony  Yes  Teen 4  Abigail's birthday party  Abigail's birthday  Teen 4  Rock  I think I promised  800 people  They could come to the next teen thing  800 people  You know we have to shorten it 
[02:28:00]  So it'll just be called  Teen 4  The birthday party  Pajama party  Dude, pajama party  Teen 4  The pajama party  Yeah  Sounds good  Yes  The pajama party  Teen 4  Book it  Teen 4  On the way  It's gotta be on her birthday  So whatever her birthday is  April  April 14th  April 14th  And the girls will have to come down  In their little nighties  Right?  Little nightgowns 
[02:28:30]  And what not  Are we on the air April 14th?  Saturday  Yeah  We might have to work Saturday  I'm willing to come in  For the show  And  If it's Saturday  Then we have to do it  That Monday  Because we can't do it  Friday  We can't do it Friday  We can't do that  One day  It's one day  She's still 16  You douchebag  Look at you  Looking like what?  What?  Missed the jailbird  Yeah  You wanna end up in there again?  It's okay if a girl's turning 22 on Saturday 
[02:29:00]  And you decided to celebrate on Friday  But when she's turning 17 on Saturday  But she's still 16 on Friday  That's what we call a loophole  That could ruin  Yeah  Alright  So we'll have to do it that Monday  Which will be April 16th  Thank you  Anthony?  Yes  We didn't even talk about Mayor Giuliani  And the sex shops  And the loopholes  Once again  This guy's the biggest jerk-off 
[02:29:30]  Mayor  In the country  Worse than Menino  Worse than UPS  Worse than AIDS  Look man  He got what he wanted  He cleaned up Times Square  He's bringing a lot of money into the city  We all know that  Are sex shops a problem anymore  In this city?  Are they really a problem?  If you even wanna look back  And say they were a problem years ago  Alright  Go ahead  Fine  Oh they were a problem  Hasn't he taken care of that?  I think so  You walk down Times Square  You're being harassed  You can't look at things 
[02:30:00]  Because  You can't bring the kids there  Because what they might see on the side  Some nude pictures and whatnot  It's ridiculous  It's fixed  Now he's going  Because there are still places you could go  If you're into that kind of thing  Because it's America  If you're into nudity  And going to the booby bars or whatever  And there's a lot of people into it  Right  And there's nothing wrong with that  Just because that little limp deed  Son of a bitch  Isn't into it  Doesn't mean other people aren't into it  And shouldn't be 
[02:30:30]  Able to go to a store  And buy videos  Or sexual toys  Or whatever the hell else  They wanna buy  At these stores  Or go see dancers  Or whatever  It gives the city a little spice  But he wants  To shut them all down  He won't be happy  Until no one  Just like him  Can have sex  No one  No one wants  To look at  He doesn't wanna look at videos  Or pictures  So now  You know when he shut down  All these sex clubs  He did it under a zoning ordinance  You can't have a sex shop 
[02:31:00]  In this zone  So the people had to adhere  To the rules  Which was some kind of  60-40 rule  Right  60% of their business  Had to be legit  Which is  You know  Regular videos  That the family can buy  Or if it's a strip club  60% of the space allocated  Have to be for food  Let's say  Something like that  A little loophole  That's why some of these  Strip clubs  You know  Give you a sandwich  Right  It's a restaurant  They're on in half of the place 
[02:31:30]  But they're  They have to  They're adhering to  Giuliani's laws  And the video stores  60%  What are some of the videos  You can get in there  If you want a legitimate video  Just  Like  The whole  Ernest series  The Ernest box set  If you want the  Ernest  Goes to box set  You know  These places  They did the 60-40  But they don't have any DVDs  They have no movies  That are past  Like 1990  Gee I'm looking for  Bill Cosby's ghost dad  Can I  Can I  Can I get a copy in here  You know 
[02:32:00]  We all know what's going on  But it's  It's really whittled down  The sex shop  But you know  It did the job  For the mayor  It kind of  You know  Hid the porno and stuff  Yeah  And if people want it  It's still there  You go into those sex stores  You can still find  Sex toys  Videotapes  Whatever you want  Well this isn't good enough now  This  Now isn't even good enough  And he's  Saying that  He's going to  Shut down the sex shops  And they're not going to be able to exist  With this 
[02:32:30]  What he calls  Loophole  That they found in the law  To keep them  Working  Meanwhile  Murderers  Rapists  All kinds of criminals  Get out of jail  Every day  On loopholes  And little legal wrangling  And he never utters  A word about that  But the sex shops  Finding a way to keep going  Because of loopholes  Now he's got a problem  This is the most uptight  Stick in the mud  Piece of crap  In the United States  Leave it alone 
[02:33:00]  You did your job  Yay  Everyone praises you  You walk through Disney Square  It's wonderful  He did the job  They're pretty much hidden now  They're not near the schools  Or anywhere where  You know  The average person  Wants to be  Yeah  Tourism's great mayor  It's fabulous  You can't walk down  The effing street  Without a tourist  Being in your way  Taking a picture  Of the hard rock  For the 8,000th time  He talks about  It's like a quality of life issue  Anthony  Yeah  There is a quality of life issue  That just hit the papers  Within the last couple days  That he just ignores  The toll's going up again 
[02:33:30]  Oh yeah  There you go  You want to help quality of life  Do something about the tolls  Going up every year  Yeah the tolls keep going up  He  Oh he doesn't utter  A word about that  And that's affecting  More people  Than any sex shops  Being open somewhere  I don't know how half  The people afford  To get to Manhattan  Do some math  We did the math  In the back  I mean  $6 each way  That's $12 a day  That's $60 a week  That's like  You're talking  $255, $60 a month 
[02:34:00]  To commute to Manhattan  Yeah  Just to drive over some bridges  That's rent for some people  Yep  That's fun  That's a quality of life issue  That affects all of us  He didn't even utter a peep  No  Nothing about that  And you know what  Know what we get  For the tolls going up  Nothing  We just still have to wait on line  Unless you got the easy pass  But even that is a hassle  Because it's so congested  Around the tolls  Yeah one thing  It's getting through the tolls quick  With the easy pass  But you got to get to the tolls first 
[02:34:30]  Right  There's not an easy pass lane  That you get to drive in  What are we getting for our money  Nothing  You're raising the tolls  Give us something extra  This way he can battle pornography  With the extra cash that he gets  It's not the potholes being fixed  That's for sure  You know what  Glad you mentioned that  Because I was driving home  From Brian Regan  Yeah  On I guess it was Saturday night  Real late  My car  Was almost swallowed up  By one of these potholes  Are you serious?  I'm not joking  I mean the pothole  Came up to  Halfway up the door  If you didn't drive  That Barbie dream car 
[02:35:00]  Well that's  A Sandy dream car  Hey man  It bought me a year  Shut up  Unbelievable though  People  Mayor  Some people enjoy  Going in  Browsing around the sex shop  You find a video  Maybe you want to bring home  A device  Have some fun in bed  Whatever  Watch a movie  Guys want to go  And blow off some steam  With the guys from work  If they want to head  To a booby bar 
[02:35:30]  You know people do this  Mayor  It's not like you're  A friggin' lunatic  A rapist  If you like doing this  You're a normal human being  You're the one  That is abnormal  The mayor of New York  Is an abnormal man  Totally  He's insane  Uh  Erin what's up  Hello  Hey  Um  I agree  With all you're saying  About Giuliani  I was hoping  You would touch on it  Yesterday  Instead of the Oscars  Which everyone else 
[02:36:00]  Talked about  But um  I used to dance  Wow  What was that  What was that  I was insulted  Because I thought  Our Oscar talk  Was better than  Anyone else's Oscar talk  In this whole damn city  I didn't even hear  What she said  She's a dancer  Blah blah blah  Uh  Danny what's going on  Uh what  Um  Yo  He should be  He should be worried about  If he's going to have  Enough teachers  This September  Hold on  Hold on  I didn't hang up on Dave 
[02:36:30]  We'll go back to him  In a second  You know  Speaking of the Oscars  Yeah  I am insulted  Because  Who else had a  An impression of Joan Rivers  Wearing Edgar's skin  On her face  Who are you wearing  I'm wearing Edgar  I was a skeleton  I'm wearing Edgar  Who gave you that  Edgar's scrotum skin  Stretched on her face  Give her  Give her a more  Youthful appearance  Wasn't Oscar talk 
[02:37:00]  Like everyone else  Don't lump us  Into that crap  Danny sorry  Yeah man  He should be worried about  If he's going to have  Enough teachers  This September man  Pay them  You know  What about all these cops  That you know  All the cops that are retiring  Or quitting  Or moving somewhere else  Now we're not going to  Have enough cops  Yeah because he won't  Give him a raise  Well we all know  He's not going to deal  With the cop situation  Because he's a puss  I mean he should deal  With the teacher situation  Most of these teachers  Are babysitters  They're not teaching anymore 
[02:37:30]  You want to talk about  Quality of life  There you go  Start busting some heads  In these school districts  Give him quality teachers  Pay him whatever they want  Yeah but then  He's going to worry about  A little sex shop here  Somebody wants to have  A little fun  Sex shop  The sex shop problem  Like Dan said  Is solved  It's time to move on  To other quality of life issues  In the city  There you go  Tolls going through the roof  With us getting nothing in return  There you go  The teacher problem 
[02:38:00]  The cops  He just don't know  He just don't  He wants to fix everything  He just don't know what's broke  That's all  Well when  Things like the tolls go up  And people get outraged  He's got to deflect it  With more sex shop talk  Because what politician  In their right mind  Is going to come out  And say  No  We need more sex shops  You know what  They don't say that  So you know something  You'll lose it  You know what frustrates me  About the tolls going up 
[02:38:30]  And the path trains going up  And the commutes from Long Island  Going up  Alright  They do it every year  Twice a year probably  Yeah  So you look at it realistically  You're like  Okay what am I getting  For my extra money  Nothing  It's the same exact thing  Same exact road  Same freaking  Construction sites  And cones  You get nothing in return  If they opened up  An extra toll booth  Or just in some way  Made it that much easier  To get through a toll  Or get over a bridge  Or you know  You ride a little easier  On the Long Island Railroad 
[02:39:00]  Then I would understand  But I haven't seen  Anything change  No you pay more  You get the same crap  Same exact service  Yeah  And then more and more things  That most  That a lot of people enjoy  Get taken away  Thank you very much  He's a douche guy  He really is  You know what he could do  You know  Chase all the strippers  You know  Out of their  Out of their  Little sex shops  And strip clubs  And gentlemen's clubs  That's what they like  To be called these days  Anthony  Gentlemen's clubs 
[02:39:30]  Gentlemen  And like you said  In the back office  But the dancers  You know  Near the tolls  In the tunnels  There you go  See  Dancers  Taking your money  At the toll booths  And working  The traffic jams  You know what  On the major highways  That way you  Move the sex shops  Out of the city  Like he wants to do  You're paying more money  For tolls  But now you're getting  The stuff that he's  Trying to take away  You're getting some return  Stupid mayor  If you knew the tolls  Were going up  But they were adding  An extra feature  There was a hot dancer  Yeah  Taking your money 
[02:40:00]  Every day  And dancing on  Side of the road  When it's a traffic jam  Who the hell's complaining  And where's the road rage  No road rage  Oh none  Done  None  Well that might be  A little ridiculous  Anthony the rape guy  Is here  From the Supremacy  Oh yeah  This is a huge coup  We're going to take a break  Quite frankly  When he walks through that door  I'm going to feel a little weird  I'm going to be like  That guy's a rapist  He's an actor  Ben I don't even want to see him  Like keep him outside  Until you know 
[02:40:30]  He walks in the door  Live on the show  Yeah  We'll be back  You know that  I don't know why I say that  But it's something to say  Going to the commercials  Yeah you taste that  Biatch  I'm a bad  Motherf***er  Lord Cuomo  That's right  That's right  I'm Rudy G  I'm here to say  My hair looks like  A roadkill toupee  I'm the number one man 
[02:41:00]  In NYC  So why are all the  Homeboy so pissed at me  I'm the R to the U  To the D to the Y  A bad motherf***er  Make the food vendors cry  Get the cars off the streets  You goddamn immigrants  That's right  That's right  I'm a bad motherf***er  Clothes are strip clubs  And porno stores  I don't care  The cops bring my whores  Kick on Al  And Farrakhan  I'm plenty f***ing tough  For a skinny white man  So squeegee guy  Trying to turn a buck 
[02:41:30]  Get yourself a job  You lazy f***er  Yeah  I'm the mayor man  I'm number one  I got a frigid wife  And a big fat son  Don't give me no s***  About Hillary  That fat ass bitch  Ain't no better than me  I can't bother  With the homeless and sick  Other motherf***ers  Can suck my d***  I'm Rudy G  Yeah  I'm Rudy G  Motherf***er  The Lisbon Mayor  Rudy G  Lord comb over 
[02:42:00]  To the motherf***ers  In the hell  Word  Hey Bill  Real fast  Cause we're going  Into commercials  Alright listen  You guys got it wrong  It's the port authority  In New York and New Jersey  That operate the toll system  I understand that  Wait wait wait  I understand that  And I'm glad you brought that up  I mean you know  If the mayor  Could shut down the sex shops  He doesn't say anything  About it though  That's the thing  He doesn't say  He sits there  And doesn't say a word about it  I know  He's got problems  With the port authority  And he's trying to 
[02:42:30]  Pull all kinds of crap  At the airport  It's the tacky  And the new governor  Of New Jersey  Let me tell you something  He's trying to get control  Of the airports  And the port authority  They won't give it to him  Hell no  That'll never happen  And he's on his way out  And there's going to be  A new mayor anyway  Right  Meet the new boss  Amen  Same as the old boss  Same as the old boss  Thank you  Thank you Pete Townsend  It's still useless  Because the port authority  Is the ones that screw up  The airports  And they screw up  That beautiful easy pass  I deal with  Congested lanes  I understand all that  But I mean  If he can make up  Laws about 
[02:43:00]  60-40 rules  In sex shops  You'd think the mayor  Would at least speak up  About it  Yeah  Well let's put it this way  The tools plan  With the wrong tool  Alright thank you  I'm not making a law  That if a guy  Without easy pass  Gets in the easy pass lane  And actually pulls up  To the gate  You are completely allowed  To just slam into him  Push him out of the way  I like that one  I'm thinking big  Like Austin Powers  Type laser thing  Trap door  Trap door  Right underneath the car  If you don't have an easy pass  If you don't have an easy pass  But you went in that lane  It opens up  And just puts you down  In a big pit 
[02:43:30]  It's like  You know  And you see those guys  In the easy pass lane  That just F's up everybody  And then  You look at the guy  In the car  And he's like  He's like  There's always some American guy  It's like Brian Reagan  Brian Reagan  Oh  Oh  Oh no  What'd I do  I'm in the easy pass lane  Hey I'm in the wrong lane  Oh no  Wally from Queens  If the mayor has a problem  With sex shops  Then he should not  Collect taxes from them  Don't collect taxes from them  It's dirty sex money Rudy  Yeah  Sure

Did they have a stunt guy?  No, I did the punch  But they have a stunt coordinator  And she throws her head back  She turns her head away, I swing  Because it looked like a good hit  It was really good  Because they put me on like a  Like a, what do you call it?

Oh, get a free ride  Yeah  Exactly  So you're saying that if the guy's hot, it's not rape?  That's what I would say  Oh, jeez  Holy, yes  I mean, not a guy you didn't know

Yeah  Anthony from West Orange  I learned Earl gets beat more than Rodney King  Ouch  Angelo from the Bronx  Today I learned that even though you guys are radio stars  You still like to be a peeping Tom like every other Joe Schmo  You stir that sauce, you 65-year-old  Or  Colonel Sanders was really looking forward to being animated into rap and basketball commercials  Today I learned I should go test drive a Lexus IS300 and never bring it back  Finally, today I learned blank about blank and blank blank 
[03:03:00]  How you doing?  Kelly  You okay?  Yeah, I'm okay  Yeah  I'm good  Kelly, man  He gave you a hug and you took a picture with him, right?  Yep  Yeah  What is that cologne?

[03:04:30]  Thursday, Derek and Russell Crowe, yeah  All right  That's it  I learned that Anthony has a stupid keychain  And I learned Opie drives the Barbie Dream car  Thanks for that  Like it or not  This will be the most popular radio show in New York City  The only show beats the hell out of my dad's old pornos  Who would have thought, uh, Stinky would be the voice of reason  Yes, Stinky, no, if Stinky said it  Then we must adhere to the Stinky rules 
[03:05:00]  Stinky, what's your problem?  We said, uh, that, uh, the guy, that, uh, Mario  That played the rapist and the Sopranos  Wants to, he's gonna do a little liner for us  You know, we have people that have been on the show  Say, hey, listen, O and A or whatever  And, um, Stinky read the script  And said, there's no way we're even gonna be able to play this  So I just said, oh, okay  Let's go with Stinky on this  Because Stinky's the voice of reason  Word is bond  What? Are you insane?  What's the problem?  Why, what's the problem? 
[03:05:30]  I just don't think we'd be allowed to play what he was gonna say  What's he gonna say?  What's he supposed to say?  Uh, listen to the Opie and Anthony show  Or I'll Rape You  Well, see, he's doing it in character  But he's doing it in character  He's doing it in character  All right  That's okay, like Mr. Amos  We had problems with that word before, I didn't think  Well, in the context of him and the show Sopranos  All right  I've learned a lesson  Stinky, you learn here on this show  Stinky, are you 
[03:06:00]  Are you also having an affair with Melissa?  See, we can't go around and say things like this, either  Just  Uh, did so  Oh, hold on  You're, uh, did so  Right, or  Charcoal briquette  Or  A moulinion  See, but it's a character from the Sopranos saying  So everything's okay  I'm Big Dick Black  Another character  Smoke weed every day  We don't endorse smoking weed, but you can say that  This is legal, isn't it?
