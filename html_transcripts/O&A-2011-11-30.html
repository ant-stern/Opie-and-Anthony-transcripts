<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a near-entirely somber tribute to the recently deceased comedian Patrice O'Neal, punctuated by the show's characteristically crude humor and offensive language.  The show began with Opie recounting a bizarre encounter at a rest stop involving a man soliciting a sexual act and using the phrase "it's cold out here" as a seemingly coded signal, leading to a comedic tangent on the phrase's possible interpretations.  This was followed by a lengthy discussion of O'Neal's death, beginning with personal anecdotes from Opie and Anthony, along with Jimmy, about O'Neal's personality, his intimidating presence, sharp wit, and softer side. They detailed their hospital visit to see him and the difficult interview with Gary Oldman conducted shortly before learning of his passing, explaining their delay in announcing the news to respect his family's wishes. Rich Voss called in to share his grief and memories.  The hosts played audio clips of news reports and O'Neal's stand-up routines.

A major portion of the show featured in-studio guests Bob Kelly, Jim Florentine, and Joe DeRosa, with phone calls from Joe Rogan, Bill Burr, and Colin Quinn.  The discussion centered on countless anecdotes about O'Neal: his comedic style, intelligence, abrasive personality, confrontations with media personalities (including a memorable Fox News appearance), and personal experiences.  Many stories involved humorous and profane recollections of his behavior, perspective, and surprising acts of kindness. The lack of a planned tribute show was discussed with humorous justifications.  The guests also touched upon O'Neal's relationships with other comedians, his comedic philosophy, and his refusal to be easily categorized.  Stories about trips to Brazil with O'Neal and further tales of his antics were also shared.  The guests included Kurt Metzger and David Telda in later segments.  Later,  Louis C.K., Dave Attell, Amy Schumer, and Colin Quinn (who later left) joined the in-studio discussion, with further reminiscing about O'Neal, including dreams they’d had about him, and expressing their grief.

A significant portion focused on O'Neal’s defense of Opie and Anthony after their suspension for a controversial bit. This sparked a debate on freedom of speech and the boundaries of humor, particularly regarding rape jokes. O'Neal’s boundary-pushing comedy was discussed, along with humorous moments including a running gag about Colin Quinn's coat, a story about a comedian with a prosthetic hand, recounted bits from past shows involving Patrice and “Bobo,” and jokes amongst the hosts.  The guests recounted jokes made about O'Neal at a roast and subsequent social media reactions.  Several guests shared experiences with O'Neal, sometimes focusing on his abrasive or unconventional behavior.  The hosts discussed their upcoming book and writing challenges.  Bob Kelly's poor spelling was highlighted by his attempt to text about O'Neal's death, and Bobby Kelly delivered a profanity-laced outburst during a phone call. Amy, another guest, left the studio during the broadcast.  The conversation often circled back to O'Neal's unique comedic style, his appearances on *The Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn*, and his relationships with other comedians, including contentious ones with Spike Lee.

The show also included segments discussing the belated airing of O'Neal's material on The Foxhole, Opie's wedding where O'Neal wore flamboyant attire, a Fox 5 news reporter’s mistaken report of O'Neal's age as 14, and a past incident involving a confrontation with Andy Dink and the online commentary referencing a prior controversial moment with Adam Wallace. The broadcast concluded with a tribute featuring a previously unreleased audio recording of O'Neal singing the blues with Warren Haynes and a mention of planned weekend-long radio special dedicated to O'Neal's work, including clips from his appearances on the show and his stand-up specials, and a playing of O'Neal's "Rock Coat" bit.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the discussion frequently employed offensive language and discussed offensive topics.

[00:02:30]  guitar solo  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel 
[00:03:00]  XM 105, Sirius 206  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen, so appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony... 
[00:03:30]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy...  I don't even like an R-opening, I don't even like an R-opening, it sounds like a little...  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. 
[00:04:00]  Good morning.  I guess we start there, right?  Hi, everybody.  Fuck.  Everyone in radio land.  I didn't sleep too well, so I got like... I'm tired.  You look wide awake, though.  That's how I just usually look. I'm always tired, so this is my wide awake look.  But it's actually tired.  This is a rough one, bro.  Trying to sleep with your own thoughts. 
[00:04:30]  You don't like that?  No.  You don't like that generally, right?  No, especially in the city, because I was staying in the city, so I didn't have the TV in the bedroom in the city.  Right.  I just don't have it in there.  So, you know, you just kind of lay there.  Why don't you have a TV in your bedroom?  I just never...  Why am I asking you? Who cares?  I'm not getting it.  I know.  But I just didn't have one, so I had to lay there with my thoughts.  Right.  I don't like my thoughts.  Especially when, you know, it's like this shit. 
[00:05:00]  It's all you think about.  You can't sleep.  It's terrible.  Terrible.  Yeah.  Bye, everyone.  I've never been in this position before.  Yeah.  This is a fucking strange world.  It blows.  I guess we start with, I don't even know, man.  That news story.  That Fox story was perfect.  You like that?  That is true.  Kevin from Connecticut.  I mean, you know, in the end, we got to try to laugh.  Kevin writes, Patrice looked terrible for 14 years old. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  You want to play that?  Yeah.  Yeah, play that clip.  Maybe that'll kickstart us and get us going.  Yeah, obviously, we lost our dear friend, Patrice O'Neal.  You're kidding.  And this was, I just told Jimmy and Ant, this was the only laugh I had yesterday.  The only one.  It was just a horrible day.  Because again, the news.  Because again.  And you know what?  Of course.  Of course.  Just listen very closely to this clip. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Sad news tonight from the entertainment world.  Comedian Patrice O'Neal has died.  O'Neal died this morning from complications from a stroke he suffered last month.  The Boston native appeared in September's Comedy Central's roast of Charlie Sheen,  where his struggle with diabetes was a punchline for many jokes.  O'Neal was a well-known presence on talk shows in the stand-up industry  and was a frequent guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  He was 14 years old.  Oh, that's a hell of a career.  14.  What were you doing at 14? 
[00:06:30]  I didn't do all that at 14.  No, no.  I knew I liked him for a reason.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Squeezed a career into 14 short years.  I was a caddy at 14.  I thought that was impressive.  Amazing.  He's doing stand-up and roasts and radio shows and movies.  14 years old.  Oh, my God.  Twitter was abuzz yesterday.  Well, I guess we got to back up to, you know, Patrice had the stroke on, what was it, like October 18th? 
[00:07:00]  26th.  I want to say it was 20-something, but I don't remember.  Yeah.  And we all knew at the time that it was not going to be fucking good, man.  And we'd just been all hanging around just waiting for the inevitable.  Yeah, you kind of hope, you know.  And then yesterday, Jimmy, like, I just knew when Jimmy grabbed his phone and ran out of the studio yesterday.  But then Jimmy didn't really tell us.  Yeah, I figured you knew.  Which is pretty amazing, because you're way better at it than me.  Because then you told me, and I'm bawling for the first time, and I can't even tell you the last time I fucking cried. 
[00:07:30]  And then we did the Gary Oldman interview.  You're right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was the longest 40 minutes of my life, just sitting here.  And it's a big fucking star.  It turned out to be a great interview in the end.  The reason is, by the way, people asked about it, and they had a legit question, like, why would you not just say it?  Because I wanted to make sure that his family, because I got the call from Matt Frost, who's his agent.  Right.  You want to make sure that the family was okay with it, because it's not about getting the news out there. 
[00:08:00]  It was about what his family wanted.  And he talked to Vaughn, and Vaughn had wanted to tell their daughter, her stepdaughter, herself.  She didn't want her to hear it, and she was in school.  Yeah, yeah.  So she wanted to be blown up on Twitter.  So out of respect for what she requested, I knew the story would be out by the time we came on today,  but the important thing was that she wanted to get to her daughter first.  So that was why we continued with the show, and I didn't say anything to the guy.  I finally told Ope, because I knew you knew, and I even think Sam could see it. 
[00:08:30]  But I couldn't.  I figured after the show, I'll tell you, as soon as 10 is on, I'll say it.  But at the bathroom, Ope asked me, and I was not going to lie, and I knew it was being obvious.  I totally got it.  I mean, you rarely run out of the studio with your phone.  Every once in a while, you might have a problem with a gig or traveling, or someone has to reschedule on the test result.  Test result.  But not like yesterday.  Yeah, I didn't want to.  But that was why.  We got some questions about it. 
[00:09:00]  And it was a fair question.  Like, how could you interview Gary Oldman after that?  But that was, I was grateful he was in, because it was a distraction.  It was almost a distraction, right?  Oh, yeah.  I think if it was just me, you, and Anne at that point, no way.  I would have wanted to end the show.  Yeah, yeah.  We probably would have abruptly got the fuck out of here.  That would have been a little rough.  But that was a distraction to have Gary in.  So, you know.  So it is what it is, as a lot of people like to say.  Yeah, yeah.  I, you know, I don't even, I don't even know what to say. 
[00:09:30]  I mean, you knew it was coming.  I knew it was coming.  You know, he was not in good shape.  And people were asking for updates, but there really wasn't much to tell.  No.  I knew it was really, really bad.  But, you know, again, when the family requests something or. . .  Yeah, you got to do what they, you know.  Do what anybody wants.  They want.  So you, you know, it was just a bad place for him to be.  And I was. . .  I didn't want my friend to die, but if the option was that, or to live in a bad way. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, I know.  To move or whatever happened.  The strokes are motherfuckers, man.  When you have a stroke in the wrong place.  It's terrible.  Look at Dick Clark.  Like, he had it in the right place, quote-unquote, to live.  Right.  And function.  But if you have it in the wrong place, you're fucking. . .  Yeah, it's just bad.  Especially someone like him.  You don't want to, you know. . .  You definitely don't want him that fucked up.  Yeah.  That giant fucking mind and. . .  Oh, I know.  Loud voice to be. . .  You can't have it. 
[00:10:30]  No, no.  You can't have it.  Just like that.  You can't have it.  It's. . .  Oh, to continue.  No, no, no.  Silenced, I mean.  You just can't be alive and have that not. . . .  No, no.  It's terrible.  We only saw him once.  We went to the hospital the day it happened.  We got a call from Bob Kelly.  Like we told you, you know.  We said we didn't know where the hospital was.  We did.  The reason we said that was because the family didn't want people. . .  And this was legit.  They were afraid that people would, meaning well, would show up at the hospital.  Because what was happening is, I know his blood pressure was going up and down. 
[00:11:00]  And they just didn't want people showing up at the hospital.  They didn't want people showing up to make amends.  Sometimes when someone's in a bad way or very, very sick, people show up to try to say you're sorry or I love you or whatever it is.  And they just didn't want any of that.  And the doctors didn't want it.  So that's why we didn't know where he was.  We weren't seeing him.  Nobody was. . .  We weren't allowed in.  And finally we went last week.  And we went and saw him.  And he was. . .  You know. . .  He actually looked oddly.  People always say he looked. . .  But he looked okay. 
[00:11:30]  I knew he was, you know. . .  At the end.  But he was thinner.  And he had a beard.  Which looked better on him than I would have thought.  You know what I mean?  Like I would have thought Patrice would look horrible on a beard.  He actually looked okay in a beard.  And it was his mom and his sister.  And Vaughn.  And then a couple of the guys went through and saw him after that over the next few days.  But we didn't talk to him morbidly.  It wasn't, you know, goodbye bro.  It was none of that stuff.  Because I didn't know at that point if he was able to hear or not. 
[00:12:00]  And there's nothing worse.  Like you kept all emotions outside the room.  Because there's nothing worse than when you. . .  You're laying there and people. . .  Are losing their shit.  Balling over you.  It's just terrible.  It's like how fucking bad do I look?  You know. . .  It's just. . .  Right.  You don't want that.  Right.  So. . .  Yeah.  You know, we just saw him for about 10 minutes.  And I'm glad I did.  Yeah.  I'm glad I saw him.  But I mean, there was nothing to be done.  I told everybody who was asking for him.  And I don't know if he heard it or not.  I hope he did.  Mm.  Mm.  You just don't fucking know. 
[00:12:30]  No.  Terrible.  Fuck.  That's really young though, man.  Geraldo too.  It's like fucking.  I know, right?  Mike DiStefano.  It's like all these guys are young.  Yeah.  DiStefano, I think he was. . . .  Was he just under 50?  Yeah.  I think he was.  Yeah.  I think they were all in their 40s, right?  Trees is a rough one though.  This is. . .  Oh, yeah.  We've all lost people.  I mean, every fucking person listening to our voices.  Oh, yeah.  But for some reason, this one is really fucking rough.  Yeah.  It's kind of a, you know, testament to who he was. 
[00:13:00]  That everybody is taking it so, so hard.  Oh.  The fucking guy is just so full of life.  He took over a room.  Just fucking took over a room.  Yeah.  Wherever he went, wherever the fucking guy went.  I remember when I first met him at NAW, Jimmy brought him in.  I was scared shitless of the guy.  He was so intimidated.  No, Voss did.  I was actually out that day, I believe.  Okay.  Yeah, I met the first day he came in.  Voss brought him in officially?  Yes, I believe Rich Voss did the first time.  I always thought it was you.  No, we had talked about him and stuff.  I think Rich did the first time.  And he came through that door, and I'm like, holy fuck, what is this big black guy about? 
[00:13:30]  It's going to be trouble.  I was fucking intimidated for a long time.  Probably the first year Patrice did the show, I was always intimidated.  And then you really got to know him and realize that in the end, fucking he was a softie, man.  Yeah.  And I mean that as a compliment.  He was a softie and had a great heart.  An amazing heart.  And a lot of people didn't have good first impressions of Patrice. 
[00:14:00]  No.  I think Bill Berg tweeted that last night saying it was always fun to watch people meet Patrice for the first time.  Because he was just that, he would just take over, man.  Physically and just emotionally.  There was no buffer period between where he would meet you and then start giving you shit.  Right.  It was just immediate.  Right.  It really was.  He'd call you out in a second.  Well, yeah. 
[00:14:30]  It's funny you should say that.  You had to have your shit together when he was around.  Oh, yeah.  Because he would call you out on everything from your dumb shirt to your stupid joke.  Yeah.  He would call you out on it.  Yeah.  He was very, a lot of guys, we were joking last night at the cellar.  I said, there's as many comedians happy tonight as there are sad.  You know, guys that he had just really told about themselves.  He could be very harsh, but, you know, the worst thing you could do with him was underestimate how smart he was. 
[00:15:00]  Like, you know, because he's a loud dude and a big black guy and, you know, and he's silly.  He never minded being silly.  If you argued with him and you didn't realize what a smart guy he was, you were going to be embarrassed.  Yeah.  And I watched him embarrass some people horribly.  Like, like, like the type beyond embarrassment of slipping on the ice, the type of embarrassment where you're stripped nude and you're exposed as being a fraud.  Right.  Like where your entire existence is opened up as being not important. 
[00:15:30]  He was able to do that with just a look, too.  Oh, yeah.  Like, he could, if somebody was being stupid, he would turn around, not even acknowledge the person and give that fucking look to you like, what the is this person?  What?  Really?  He would just dismiss you with one glare.  With that look.  Fucking hilarious.  I don't, I don't, I know I never got one over on him, ever.  Never.  Yeah.  Not, not a one.  Colin had a very funny tweet about him.  Can you get, grab Colin's, uh, Twitter feed. 
[00:16:00]  Um, he had, I don't know how many he sent out yesterday, but he sent out one that I thought was very, did you have it open?  Uh, no.  Um, I don't have that one.  That fucking Mad Magazine thing that you had from a tough crowd is hilarious.  Oh, this is, thanks to everybody for the Patrice O'Neill comments.  One of a kind.  In heaven right now, charming half and infuriating half, then reversing.  Yeah, yeah.  And that really, then reversing.  Then reversing is classic. 
[00:16:30]  Fucking classic.  That is exactly, exactly a perfect summation of Patrice.  I would go home so tired after he did our show.  Just cause he challenged you, man, to be on your fucking toes.  You had to bring up your emotion.  You had to be in it, you know?  And mentally I would go home, like just having, knowing I had the best fucking time.  And also just being exhausted from, from him.  He, um.  Just how he twisted, twisted shit.  Just twisted little, little things in pop culture that you never thought of before. 
[00:17:00]  And people were last night, they're like, what was your favorite Patrice moment?  I mean.  Please.  And I, I realized late last night, I can't, I can't put my finger on one because I start  thinking of a few and then all of a sudden another five or six pop up in your head.  Yeah.  I guess this weekend we're just going to play nothing but Patrice.  Yeah, yeah.  On, uh, on this channel, so.  I find it hard to listen or watch videos, like, right now.  I could read shit, like when people tweet shit, and they're like, oh, remember this 
[00:17:30]  one?  And then you kind of play it in your head and hear the voice and everything like that.  But to watch videos right now, it's still too, it's a little tough.  It's a little tough.  Yeah, yeah.  You hear that one of him laughing?  Oh, I know, yeah.  That's one of my, it's probably my favorite video of him because that, to me, like, that's  the guy I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, whatever, because a lot of people were scared of him, he was, he was mean, he was  laughing, but that fucking silly motherfucker, like, the guy falling on the floor, genuinely  falling on the floor.  Right.  Laughing at Bobo's dick. 
[00:18:00]  Like, that's the guy.  If you ask me to sum up Patrice and what I know, that's it.  Yeah, yeah.  In that moment.  And, uh, I had a few moments with him like that in our existence together, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  In Brazil, laughing at this guy, Evan, trying to speak Portuguese.  We had, we laughed like that.  And, uh, and Will, uh, Sylvain, who loved him and was his roommate, um, when we saw  his bunions on his feet, we all came in and his feet had the worst bunions ever seen.  And we'd probably laugh like that for 15 minutes.  That was one of his qualities. 
[00:18:30]  I mean, he was tough, but if he found you funny or something, he said funny, man, he  would absolutely give it to you, you know?  Yeah.  He would absolutely make, make sure you know that was fucking funny.  And that laugh would come out, man.  He wasn't afraid of funny people.  He wasn't afraid to be around funny people.  Funny people never are.  Like, he embraced funny people and he loved being in that environment and he loved being  made fun of and he loved making, he loved teasing people.  Oh, yeah.  More than anything, he loved to tease somebody.  Yeah, that's pretty much, yeah, yeah. 
[00:19:00]  That was his, uh, one thing that he really loved doing.  And he would say it in that schoolyard vernacular.  He would say it like, I just love to tease people.  He's like, you're 40.  He's 14.  14, I apologize.  That's 14.  Rich Voss is on the line.  Mr. Voss, how are you, sir?  How's it going?  Hey, buddy.  Well, we're just trying to, I don't know.  I don't know what we're trying to do.  We're here, though.  How are you, buddy?  I've had nonstop anxiety. 
[00:19:30]  I'm devastated.  And it's all because I spelled his name wrong.  Yes.  Only Rich.  I guess.  Only Rich.  I don't know who had it, but Huffington Post had like everyone's tweets.  I think it was them.  And Rich was the only one that spelled his name wrong.  But that's perfect, Rich.  Coming from you, that's perfect.  He wouldn't have had it any other way.  Yes.  You know, and I didn't even know this, Huffington Post, I'm in there at home lately, and I'm 
[00:20:00]  looking at it.  There's some nice whatever tweets, this and that.  And I said to Bonnie, I go, you know, this media, I mean, I'm one of his best friends in  the world, and she said, well, they might have put it in it if you didn't spell his name  wrong, stupid.  But, you know, like, it's hard for me to show emotions.  You guys know that.  Right.  And when I'm, like, you know, when I get to do this in the morning, I'm really sad. 
[00:20:30]  And, you know, I'm trying to go about my day, and I'm in the park lot of Dunkin' Donuts  writing this, and all of a sudden, like, tears and snot, everything's running down my  nose.  But then I'm thinking, well, maybe the Giants will bounce back next week.  So, I mean, it's really probably the most devastated I've ever felt in my life.  I don't know, you know, nothing like this has ever happened, even with anybody in my 
[00:21:00]  family.  You know, I was never as close to anybody as of now in my life in my family as I was  to him, you know.  And like I said, in the dumb tweet, the most fun I've ever had in my life, he was  involved, Norton was involved, you know.  But, I mean, there were times we stood outside of Boston Comedy Club, and people in their  apartments were yelling at us to shut up.  You know, they're hanging out, they want to shut up, and we're just out there. 
[00:21:30]  Did you feel like you were on stage?  Yeah, so me, you, Keith, fucking Bobby.  Oh, God.  It was just the most fun.  There's nothing with him but good memories.  Right.  There's nothing but good memories.  Well, the last time I did radio with you guys and him, I was kind of upset he didn't  shut his face.  I just smashed me the whole day.  And, of course, I'm driving home thinking, well, I should have said this, or I should have 
[00:22:00]  said that.  But nothing but good memories, you know.  And the most fun in my life as a comic or a person, the most fun in my life is from being  a comic.  Yeah.  The most fun from being a comic.  I've got to ask you guys something, because what I've heard a lot in the last month or  so is this one really hurts.  And you guys are in a world more than us, although we get a taste of it, where a lot of, you've  seen a lot of guys die young. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  But a lot of you guys are saying this one really fucking hurts.  And I've said the exact same fucking thing.  This one really fucking stings.  And I want to know why.  One, it came out of nowhere.  I had to ask him.  Out of nowhere.  I was going to ask for Jimmy, because Jamal articulated.  The last thing you saw that to me, the last thing you saw Patrice do on TV was that roast.  Yeah.  He completely stole the whole roast.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  Completely.  So, you know, you're at his bar because he's bigger in life.  You know, and I said this too.  He's what, Rich?  He's bigger what?  Bigger than life.  Right.  Yes.  When Patrice was around, like when we sit at the cellar, like last night we were there,  we're having a good time.  But when Patrice was around, you really had to step up your game.  It's like, it wasn't like, hey, you know, because if you even, whatever, it was just like 
[00:23:30]  the nucleus of the whole thing.  And I hate to put, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I do.  You're not wrong either, man.  He was, I mean, it really was, he was too big a focal point, too loud a guy, too big  a presence.  It's the worst one.  And I've had a lot of people I love, a lot of people I love have died.  But this one, I think is the hardest, at least up to this point.  And when you say he was the focal point, I mean, we all know people that are just loud  and you're like, shut the fuck up. 
[00:24:00]  With him, it was effortless.  You know what I mean?  It was effortless with him.  He wasn't trying to force himself into situations or any of that crap.  He was just who he was.  Someone just wrote, the funny thing is, Patrice would be slamming Voss right now.  Yeah, of course he would.  He would.  Yeah.  And that's why I'm going to Little Beach to play golf.  Because when someone passes away, all you have to say is, that's what they would have  wanted.  Like, nobody knows.  Yes, you would play golf.  That's right.  The last time I spoke to Patrice, he said, play as much golf as you possibly can. 
[00:24:30]  As opposed to, yeah, Friday and Saturday nights is when you should play.  On a night course.  It was always fun.  We were in, one time we were in Amsterdam.  And, I mean, I was, and so is Norm, but I've been in Amsterdam.  I never went there.  And Patrice, and Brazil with Patrice.  But we were in Amsterdam.  And we were done, we were taping a TV show and doing a show and we're done with it.  And we go, let's go to the window, you know, the red light district. 
[00:25:00]  And Lisa Lambinelli's like, can I go?  And Patrice laid into her, like, are you out of your mind?  Why would we bring you?  So now she's in the bathroom crying.  And I figured, well, I'll go in to console her so I can just check out the hot girls going  into the bathroom.  Right?  So I, it was, like, there was no way he was letting her come with us to the red light  district.  Not that we were doing it.  We were just going to go sightseeing.  And it just, he never held back. 
[00:25:30]  He never held back.  Yeah, him and Lisa had a really weird adversarial relationship.  And he felt bad about it, though.  At one point, he really, he got, Patrice went through a thing where he felt really bad  about a lot of the, because like most people, you know, you don't sometimes think.  Like, and as you get a couple years older, he felt really bad about that.  Like, and he apologized to Lisa.  Like, he, in Florida, on the young Ron and Paul show, or young Paul, I wish we could mix  that up.  But she was on, and Patrice was supposed to come on, and she didn't want to be in the 
[00:26:00]  room when he was there.  Like, she was scared of him.  Wow.  And he's like, what am I doing?  Like, it just struck him as to how shitty it was that they had that relationship.  And he said he was, I think he said he was sorry to her.  And they made up, and, you know, I'm glad for him that he did that, and I'm glad for  her.  Well, a lot of people in the 12-step vote would call that making the best.  Yeah, I understand that, but he wasn't, you know, he wasn't sober.  He didn't need to be sober.  He wasn't an alcoholic.  No, not at all. 
[00:26:30]  But, I mean, it was just, it was always fun.  And I don't think when he did that in Amsterdam was personal.  It was just that, hey, this is dudes.  We're going to go to the, you know, the red light district.  You know, if it would have been any female, he would have done, you know, he would have  been, no, you're not coming.  He gave her a hard time, though.  He gave her this hard time.  And she'll tell you that, and he would have told you that.  Well, I know, but we all give each other a hard time.  We were at Caroline's one day, years ago, and I was host.  He was on the show.  And he went up, and his whole set was smashing me, and how I slobbered, and he's up there 
[00:27:00]  doing his act with a speech impediment.  And I'm like, I was, I've never been as mad as I've ever been in my life.  And I went up there, and I was just like, I couldn't even, you know.  But there was times at Caroline's, we used to do this bit, me and Patrice, where he would  go on, if I was host, he'd go on stage, and he'd chill, no matter what.  And then I'd go on after him, and I'd start, like, talking with somebody in the audience, 
[00:27:30]  and I would say something like, oh, look at the size of your eyes, one of my dumb bits.  And in the back, you'd hear, Jesus, at the top of his lungs.  You know, Jesus, maybe he has that eye disease, right?  And then I would say something to somebody else, and you'd hear, you know, Jesus, right?  And it was the most fun how we would go back and forth, and it was so unforced.  He just made it seem like it was supposed to happen. 
[00:28:00]  I remember him sitting back by where the dressing room is at Caroline's, just right where you  guys come out, and sitting back there, and just trashing Rich as he was doing his act.  Sitting there going, shut up!  Shut up!  Was he with us that horrible New Year's Eve?  Yes!  And we went to the worst restaurant in the world.  Yeah, you had a mouthful of, like, herring or some shit. 
[00:28:30]  Wait, was that with you guys then?  We met you and your ex-girlfriend a year ago?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were off the air at that point.  We all went out.  That was it.  Yeah, it was with Melinda at the time.  Yes.  And we were walking down the street, and there was some homeless people, of course, out on  the street, and we passed by, I guess, a couple of black homeless people, and then Melinda  pulled out a five and gave it to the white, one of the white homeless people, and Patrice  just laid into her.  He said, oh, look at you, you're a sweet little racist, and just started fucking pounding it.  It was hilarious. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, we ended up in some shitty diner on New Year's Eve.  How depressing was that?  That was terrible, that diner.  That was awful.  It was very, very bad food.  I was so disappointed.  I had my heart set on some good food.  Yeah.  I had a shitty diner.  Yeah, New Year's Eve with the one host from the radio show, you don't want to be with  as much as the other one, but the other one, who knows what he's doing, because he can't  make a commitment.  So, yeah, you know, he probably had a fever or something wrong with his finger, so he stayed 
[00:29:30]  in that night.  I'm ready to hear it, so.  So we were out with the other full-blown alcoholic.  Like, it didn't really matter what you were eating, because she was going to throw it  up later or anything.  I know.  Shit, asshole.  Fuck.  You know, it's odd that you even bring up the fact with drinking and the fact that Patrice  didn't drink, but the one time, the only time I saw him drink was at a party at my house.  We were drinking Guinness, and he was like, I want to try one of those. 
[00:30:00]  I was like, oh, fuck yeah, you know.  I gave him a Guinness, and I just remember, he sat in that big leather chair.  I have this big fucking leather chair.  No one sits in it, in my house.  And he fucking kicked back in this thing and drank a Guinness, and it was just really a cool  fucking thing to hang out and actually have a beer with Patrice.  That was fun.  I don't know if I ever saw him drink.  I mean, maybe in Brazil.  We did Brazil, I think, three times together.  At least twice, I think three.  And he might have on one occasion had a few sips. 
[00:30:30]  I don't remember.  But he was not a drinker.  No, and the funny thing was, he's such a big guy, and he had quite a little buzz on after  one pint of Guinness.  What a lightweight.  Oh, I know.  He just got that, his eyes were at half-masked, and he got that big smile on his face, and  everything was hilarious.  And yeah, it was kind of cold watching him sit in that giant chair, just drinking.  We were in Amsterdam, and I'm with another comic from England.  I've told this story before from England. 
[00:31:00]  His name's John Sealy or whatever.  English comic.  John.  So a funny guy.  So we're in the Red Light District, me and him.  And for some reason, I wasn't going in that night.  I just was hanging out with him.  So he went, this guy, John, goes into a window, and he's doing whatever with the prostitute.  Then after, he's smoking pot with her, and the prostitute says to him, what do you do?  And this is, you know, one prostitute out of a million, and John says, I'm a comedian. 
[00:31:30]  And the prostitute goes, do you know Patrice?  Out of all the people.  A prostitute.  In a window looking hamster, man.  You know Patrice?  I said, yeah.  And then the prostitute said, you made me cry in the bathroom.  What are the odds?  Just nothing but great stories.  It's devastating.  This is, you know, like Norm says, it's just, it was bigger than life. 
[00:32:00]  No, I said that.  Sorry, larger than life is an expression we've probably both embraced at one point.  Between us, we're 90.  Yeah, that's true.  So, anyhow, I'm driving to this stupid airport.  And when I get to the airport, I'm going to have to do, I got to do a call, and there's  some radio show on Myrtle Beach, but not about this.  So, it's going to be, so, you know, and it's going to be the guy and the girl, and they're  going to be all happy.  Oh, God. 
[00:32:30]  In the middle of it, I'll probably just start crying.  And what's wrong?  Well, besides the fact, I'm talking to you two.  That's what I'll tell them.  Well, why not, you know, just...  Just go with it.  Tell them what's going on.  Like, I have to do radio after this, and I have to do a phone to promote a gig, and  say, what?  I can't pretend it's not happening.  Yeah, but, you know, yeah.  Fuck those little zoo crews, the morning shows.  If they can't handle a, you know, a real moment, yeah, fuck them. 
[00:33:00]  They don't deserve to, you know, they deserve what they get, which is nothing.  Exactly.  Well, that's what they get when I call in anyhow.  A little self-deprecating humor.  Yes, of course.  It's almost, it's like a number after the World Trade Centers when we, you know, you  guys were in it, and I called in, and you started, for some reason, smashed me, and  they go, oh, we're back.  Yeah, yeah.  Was that how we got back into the jokes?  Going after Voss?  Probably.  I always wondered what the first one was. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, you got back into a real joke.  As he said, after the World Trade Centers.  Centers, yeah.  Yeah, all of them.  There's a lot of them down there.  Yeah.  The jokes, and the riddles, and then the wacky games, that's when it all started up  again.  Did we have wacky games back then?  Oh, we always have wacky games, don't we?  All right, I'll give them that one.  Yeah, wacky games.  All right, Rich.  All right, well, listen, everybody hang in there.  Well, that's it.  Riddles.  People got riddles? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I guess we got riddles, too.  We did a riddle segment, Rich.  Riddle me this, Batman.  Whatever you do.  Riddles.  Riddles.  Riddles in your head.  I'm holding you.  Riddles.  Riddles.  What else do you call them?  Riddles.  When was the last time riddles meant anything to anyone?  They're on Dixie Cups.  That's right, yeah.  I'll talk to you guys later.  All right, Rich.  Thank you, brother.  Rich Voss, everyone.  Rich Voss, yes.  I guess a lot of people coming in to say a few words, huh? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I think Florentine wants to come in.  Patrice loved Jim.  Ah.  I saw Amy last night.  I'm not sure who else is coming.  I mean, Bobby, Bob Kelly.  Yeah, the tweets were really nice.  A lot of people tweeting.  A lot of people I wouldn't have expected, you know, like some heavy hitters.  It just goes to show, you know, how fucking great he was. 
[00:35:00]  Well, at least they, in the entertainment, E! Online, at least they've got all of his friends when they're quoting tweets.  Oh.  But I get, I'm not even really mad at it.  It's funny, it is just.  Oh, really?  It just shows you what dummies.  They can't help themselves.  No.  And I think part of it is.  They're like, we need names.  In their world, what names are.  They just don't know.  So they have to go with the heavy hitters instead of his actual, you know, close friends. 
[00:35:30]  I don't see a tweet here from Norton or Kelly or Voss or Colin.  None of them.  They just don't know.  But it was funny that they just chose people who, but Charlie I get because he roasted Charlie.  Yeah, yeah.  He liked him.  But it was, and of course, Dane.  They started together.  You know, and Sarah's famous and she liked Patrice.  I don't think they knew each other that well, but I could be wrong.  I love this one, though, from Seth Meyers. 
[00:36:00]  And again, Seth was just tweeting.  He wasn't trying to get on the website.  Right, yeah, yeah.  Rest in peace, Patrice O'Neal.  A day spent watching clips of him online is a day well spent.  Spoken like a guy who spent a lot of time with him.  But again, I'm not faulting.  Right, right.  I'm not faulting Seth because he's just writing a nice thing about a guy he probably didn't know that well or no.  Yeah, it's once again just lazy reporting, which we talk about all the time on this show.  You could have got some pretty damn emotional tweets about Patrice yesterday. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  They decided to go with Seth because I guess he's a big fucking star.  What dummies.  Give us a fuck he's a big fucking star.  There were some emotions going around yesterday.  That one made me laugh, though.  That one made me laugh because Patrice just would have said, just admit you didn't know me.  Yeah, right.  Just say it.  Right, right.  You didn't care.  You didn't know me.  Give a fuck.  Right, exactly.  That's the weird, twisting, ironic thing of this whole thing is I would love to hear 
[00:37:00]  Patrice's take on his death and the way people are reacting to it because it would just be  stuff like that.  Like, you don't know.  What the fuck?  That's what it would be.  I think if you were able to get through his outer shell, and this is going to sound so  hokey, but he would absolutely appreciate this.  He would appreciate it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He'd appreciate it, but he would fucking make fun of quite a few things.  He was on guard.  He was on guard most of the time, but you were able to get in there. 
[00:37:30]  He would call out the fraudulent parts of it.  Oh, absolutely.  He would appreciate people who love him.  He would always appreciate people who loved him.  I mean, he really did.  But the things like that, and I'm not saying Seth's being a fraud.  He just wrote a nice thing about a guy.  Right.  It's a nice thing to write if he didn't know somebody.  Just saying he was funny.  Oh, no.  I blame the lazy reporting.  The lazy reporting.  Because they could have picked through the tweets and made it.  And found out who knew him as a person and who knew him as a comic, and just a performer.  You don't always need just a big name. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, it's just silly.  Obviously, from that tweet, he didn't know him as a person.  He knew him as a comic.  And as a reporter, you should know that and go, well, all right, that was kind of nice.  But this guy, obviously, has no idea who he really was as a human being.  A day spent watching is a day well spent.  A day well spent.  Why don't you're spending days spending.  Yes, that's a day that was spent well.  Why don't we play something from Patrice?  You got something relatively short, Eric, as we go to break?  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  I mean, we could go as long as 10, 15 minutes if you got something.  All right, yeah.  Everything.  I cut up Patrice's Elephant in the Room special, and we've got a bunch of cuts here.  I'd like to focus.  You shouldn't play all of it, because.  Yeah, I'd like to focus on stuff he did on our show.  Yeah.  It's a good point, because Elephant in the Room, you want people to buy.  So it goes to his family and his stepdaughter.  Yeah.  Well, we're going to have to figure out a lot of stuff.  E-Rock's pirating it.  E-Rock's like, look, when the wake is held, I'll be selling Elephant in the Room on the corner. 
[00:39:00]  You know, bootleg copies.  I'll sign it.  You know, Jimmy makes a good point.  We all know we could get our shit for free these days.  We all know.  But, you know, this is going for a great cause.  Elephant in the Room.  Fucking download it.  It's going to go to, you know, Patrice's family.  Isn't it ironic that E-Rock's trying to find Elephant in the Room?  I know.  He just keeps looking at mirrors going, oh, wrong.  Yeah, if you appreciate it or love the guy, just, you know, do the right thing and actually  fucking buy it today.  Yeah, because...  Even if you have a copy, just buy it again. 
[00:39:30]  There's medical bills, and there's his stepdaughter, and there's Vaughn, who he wanted to take care  of, and...  His mom.  I had never met his sister, and it was funny.  She was nice, man.  She was really nice.  And she, in the mouth, she just looked...  She smiled.  She looked...  Oh, shit, really?  Like...  Really?  Patrice.  Patrice...  It was...  It was chilling.  Oh, wow.  I saw her in the hospital, and I just couldn't believe the mouth.  Like, you forget how specific somebody's mouth is when they speak, and they smile, and just 
[00:40:00]  the...  It's Patrice.  Wow.  It's very odd to see that in a living person when someone's really sick.  That's right.  People will be coming in, I guess, today, and we'll just talk about Patrice.  I mean...  Yeah, well, what do you got to play to play?  Patrice, by the way, can I say, I loved all the tweets, and they were all nice, and the  emails, and they really are nice, and people say, oh, people reaching out is nice.  It is.  Even though you're hearing from strangers, they know you're grieving, and people were  very genuine.  Yeah, I only had to block like three people, I think. 
[00:40:30]  I blocked one.  Total.  I had one block.  I mean, people fucking...  They just get it and understand.  When it's something close to home, you don't fuck with it.  Tomorrow, someone, you know, whatever.  But do you know what I mean?  When it's close to you, you just don't fuck with it.  That's always been the rule in this world.  Yeah, people have been cool.  They're crying their eyes out out there.  I can't tell you how many tweets I read from people just fucking bawling all day yesterday.  Yeah, people are very upset.  What do you got, E-Rock? 
[00:41:00]  All right, I got a short version of Patrice doing It's Raining Stuff.  Is it just a song, or is it the whole...  No, the whole thing was too long, but this gets right to the heart of it, so...  You want to do that?  All right, and just for the people that are wondering, yeah, all weekend long here on  the channel, and we're not promoting it for our...  We're just letting you know.  Yeah, let people hear it.  Yeah, letting you know, you know, that all weekend long, it's going to be nothing but  Patrice on this channel.  And E-Rock will be playing his CD in its entirety, so you can just record it.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  And F the family over.  Way to go, E-Rock.  I tried.  All right, here's Patrice O'Neal.  And just to be tortured like that, and just want to express himself with women's songs.  Yeah.  I got to say, what?  Yeah, singing the women's songs.  And it's like, you know, guys, it's like how real guys change the lyrics to men's...  You know, it's raining stuff.  Yeah.  Hallelujah.  It's raining things.  And it's all wet out here.  Tough. 
[00:42:00]  Oh.  It's wet out here.  Rough and tough.  It's wet outside.  It's raining things.  Oh.  You got to change the words to this.  Wow.  It's raining stuff.  Let yourself get absolutely yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's raining.  Oh.  Holy.  Woo. 
[00:42:30]  Ow.  Ow.  Ouch and ooh.  Watch out, motherfuckers.  Yeah.  Roll for Jesus.  He was a bad motherfucker.  Woo.  Oh.  And he had to do what he had to do.  Loving him out, man. 
[00:43:00]  Rearrange the sky.  So that each and every brother.  Can get out there and do.  Woo.  It's raining stuff.  Oh.  It's raining things.  Uh-huh.  Watch out.  Shit is flying around.  Oh.  The fuck was that?  Some heavy shit flying around. 
[00:43:30]  Watch your shit.  Watch your shit.  Oh.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  This motherfucker was like,  Queen of the night.  I got the stuff that you want.  My pussy's wet as a...  Holy shit.  It's raining stuff.  Oh.  Thank you, Nathaniel.  Oh.  Nobody. 
[00:44:00]  God damn.  We changed the lyrics, but you know.  I think we got a hit on our hands.  It's raining stuff.  The O.P.  The Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  You don't fuck a bitch who thinks she can be number one.  I cheat on my girl.  It's with fat bitches that know what my girl look like and go, number two is good.  Even number three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  Three.  I've been saying, look.  I'm a decent motherfucker.  It's because I want some side pussy.  It's because I want other pussy as opposed to yours doesn't make me evil. 
[00:44:30]  Dudes want side pussy.  You're never going to meet a girl whose timing ain't broken.  You know what I'm saying?  I said a pussy smell like mini burgers.  Ooh.  Your girl looks better than me.  I got no self-esteem.  Your side pussy.  God damn, you got some nice titties.  Ooh.  To put it simply.  I'm pulling number three.  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  What women do have to understand is that we look. 
[00:45:00]  That's a part of our soul.  We don't bleed every month.  We don't fucking sit down to pee.  We don't pop babies out.  The one thing that we suffer with is when we're committed.  And women should understand what commitment is.  It's a commitment to us, not commitment to them.  It's a commitment that I can be not a piece of shit one day in my life.  Um, that it doesn't solve the problem of strange twat everywhere.  One side pussy.  We don't have the tools to fight young, delicious women. 
[00:45:30]  That's safe.  Patrice, I want to fuck you bad.  First of all, any bitch who doesn't want her asshole licked is an asshole.  Side pussy.  Pussy.  Side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Ooh.  Take it from me.  My ass is a guarantee.  Your side pussy.  Can you hear how delicious that sounded?  Ooh, I'll be your fucky.  I'm not too hard to believe. 
[00:46:00]  Your side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  That's how Harlem got hooked on heroin in the 20s.  They give you the uncut dope.  And then as soon as you go, they go, got you, punk motherfucker.  That's what they do.  And it's not their fault.  It's not malicious.  It's just nature.  That's what they do.  They can't help it.  Nigga, what are you talking about?  Dudes want side pussy.  Ooh, we'll tell anyone that we get a fuck or twice a week. 
[00:46:30]  Your side pussy.  Hey, can I lick your asshole?  Ooh, your girl looks better than me.  But I'm more nasty.  Ooh, your side pussy.  That's what I say to the milkman, nigga.  Ooh, I wanna fuck you bad Patrice.  Patrice, how you gonna say no to me?  Yo, side pussy.  Don't be such a pussy.  Go get some side.  Patrice, you gotta tell your story.  Oh, shit.  Dude, that is a funny fucking story, man. 
[00:47:00]  That is a really funny fucking story.  Listen to what happened to Patrice since the last time we saw him.  Yeah, it was like Christmas time.  I had driven home, went to, you know, go to Boston for a second.  So I'm driving back, driving back through, you know, Connecticut.  You know, you drive and you get that scared tired, like that tired that you just, you go,  oh my God, I'm getting ready to die tired.  You don't have any more confidence in yourself that you can keep yourself awake. 
[00:47:30]  You're like, oh damn.  It's cold, so all the windows are down, fucking young Jeezy, yeah, I'm up, motherfuckers.  Blasting, punching your leg.  And just that type of tired, where I went to sleep a couple of times.  So I said, I got to find some, I was getting ready to pull over to the side.  Do you start having the logic in your head where you're like, I could close my eyes for  five seconds?  Man.  It's not when you're driving.  You've never done that?  No.  I've sat there.  Oh, I've done that.  Petrified, just like Patrice is talking. 
[00:48:00]  I think I can give it, just, all right, just two seconds.  I sit there with your eyes open going, motherfucker, you got to stay awake.  You've never negotiated with yourself?  No, no, I have, but it's been.  And said, I think I could do a couple seconds here?  No.  Because you're so tired that your logic is starting to go?  No, my logic goes in a different way, where you're driving, your eyes are open, you're  watching the road and you're going, motherfucker, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake.  Stay awake.  Stay awake.  All right.  Stay awake.  And then, like, oh, trees, road, sky, and you're just out, and then, what the fuck? 
[00:48:30]  I was just telling you to stay awake, asshole.  Like, at first, you're driving and your hand is at the bottom, you know, where your hand  is pointed up, and you're controlling the bottom of the wheel.  Then when you get those scares, you put your left hand out the window, hang out the window,  drive with your hand on the top.  Okay, I'm up now.  Oh, no.  I'm that kind of horrified, tired, so I got to stop. 
[00:49:00]  I do the Harvey Keitel fucking Reservoir Dogs chant to myself, you got to stay awake.  Come on.  I smack myself in the face.  Stay awake.  Stay awake.  You're going to fucking stay awake.  I don't know how, like, the truck drivers, they must know tricks to them.  Yeah, they know tricks, all right, it comes in a bottle, or it comes in fucking a piece  of tinfoil, or wherever the fuck.  Oh, shit.  It's called crystal methadrine.  I really am a corny motherfucker, because I'm thinking, boy, those guys, man, how do they 
[00:49:30]  do it?  Cocaine!  Coke, crystal meth, whatever keeps you fucking going.  Whatever gets the load there on time.  Oh, my God.  It gets you from wrapping up a family of five.  I'm sitting there thinking they must have, oh, they channel Yum Curry, the magical truck  god that gives them energy and strength, you know?  Truck god.  Truck god.  The truck god.  There's a truck god.  You snort it through a straw, you smoke it, whatever.  Oh, my God.  So, I'm driving and shit, and I go, I see a McDonald's in the distant, you know, oh, shit. 
[00:50:00]  McDonald's fucking rest stop.  Yeah.  So, I just do 95 till I get there.  Pull in there, park, I go, thank God.  I lean my seat back.  Now, you know, I drive up.  What time is this about?  About three in the morning.  Oh, wow.  Way to go, Mr. Jordan.  Wow.  Way to go, Mr. Jordan.  I just always leave late.  I just always just go there and come back, like, leave at 12.  Yeah.  No traffic.  I kind of like the no traffic angle. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, no traffic.  No traffic.  Go down to Merritt or 95 from time to time.  Yeah.  So, I park there.  I put my seat back.  Now, I drive a Suburban, and it's nigg it up.  Big time.  Like, you know, I got 22s just so it don't fuck because I drive in New York.  I will get 24s.  Yeah.  But, you know, the potholes fuck your shit up.  So, I got tent that's, like, as black as anything, you know.  And the whole nine.  And so, you know, I put my seat back.  Whew.  Thanking God.  Put my skylight up.  I look in the sky and shit.  Just fall asleep.  I lean back. 
[00:51:00]  You're probably out in, like, two seconds.  About two seconds.  Yeah.  But for some reason, you know, after about a good five minutes of sleeping, I just, my  eyes open.  Nothing woke me up.  Just my eyes open.  Right?  Not a sound.  Nothing.  Just open your eyes.  Oh, boy.  I look to the left.  Then I look to my right.  Out my passenger side.  There's a guy looking in my window.  Oh, man.  Clean cut white guy.  Abercrombie and Fitch.  Yeah.  Fucking ties. 
[00:51:30]  Clean.  And I'm looking at him.  Did you jump?  No.  No.  I don't get scared like that.  I can't fucking have anybody.  Movie fear fucks me up.  Like, you know, creepy shadow figures.  But, like, people don't.  Dude.  Fucking any.  If I open my eyes and someone's there or something.  Bad dick.  Yeah.  You gotta try to stay cool.  Oh.  And you gotta understand.  I almost got raped by that big black guy.  I stayed cool.  You gotta understand how tinted my windows are.  Yeah.  You gotta understand this. 
[00:52:00]  Now, I look at him to try to give him, like, for 30 seconds, we were looking at each  other.  Like, just kind of staring.  So, I finally go, okay, this nigga ain't leaving.  I turn my key backwards.  We just cracked my window about an inch.  I go, what's up, man?  He goes, it's cold out here.  It's cold.  It's cold out.  It's cold out. 
[00:52:30]  I go, what?  He goes, it's cold out here.  And he tries my handle on my door.  He pulls my door handle.  Holy shit.  It's cold out here.  Pulls my door.  I go, what?  What the fuck?  We'll go inside.  I go, we'll go inside.  There's coffee in there.  Now, I'm sitting there not thinking anything except for this is some crazy motherfucker who  needs warmth.  And I'm going, well, you know, I'm sorry, dude, but, you know, you're not going to warm  up in my fucking car, you know?  He thought you were a gangster fan.  And so, he walks away. 
[00:53:00]  I'm looking at him.  And I'm still not, my energy still isn't like, what the fuck?  I'm just like, that was weird.  That's a little odd.  From New York, you know?  So, this, I watch him, this motherfucker gets into a Subaru Outback with a Christmas  tree on top and drives away.  And that's when, that's when the adrenaline kicked out.  I said, this motherfucker, he was going, he was going to suck strange black dick before 
[00:53:30]  he went home to take a Christmas tree to his fucking family.  It gave me, it was like drinking 14 cups of coffee and a Red Bull once I said, this  guy was a fag.  I didn't know.  I thought he was just a creepy cold guy.  He's a creepy cold guy.  A little cold.  I felt so bad for women that this guy, I wanted to, it was almost like I let something evil 
[00:54:00]  escape.  Like, I wanted to follow him and just go to his lair and go, this guy is, ma'am, your husband  is trying to suck strange gangster cock.  And it, it, it was, and it was just like Gangsta Fag Song.  It was a well-dressed fucking businessman type sucking dick at a Connecticut restaurant.  White dude.  Wow.  It was un, it's cold out here.  What? 
[00:54:30]  It's cold out here.  That's something that you say.  And pulls my fucking, my handle on my door.  Like you felt like you let something evil escape like that.  I felt like I let him, like I said, I should have, like for the duty of the world, like  just chase this guy.  Because you think the family he's bringing that fucking Christmas tree home has any clue  that their husband is sucking rest stop dick and has a rest stop code.  Like I'm going, if I was a fag, is that the code?  It's cold out here.  Oh.  Oh, the pigeons fly in January. 
[00:55:00]  Hop on in, faggot.  Hop on in, click, the door unlocks.  Click, click.  You think he drove away with Christmas music in his car line.  And then he gets in and rolls his hand like, it really was cold out there.  That was the fag code, but it's chilly.  I'm just cold.  Thanks for helping a brother out.  That's what got me was the Subaru Outback and I just covered my mouth like, like I just  let, I let evil go.  I let it go.  I let it, I should have followed him.  Honey, honey, I'm home with the tree.  Get the kids.  With the fucking tree.  And he, with the dude. 
[00:55:30]  I shouldn't even care about shit like that.  You know what I'm saying?  It's just, it seems so evil.  Yeah.  So fucking evil.  Wow.  Wow.  It's cold out here.  It's cold out here.  Well, anyone ask that?  Way to read the signs though, you dummy.  I'm such a, I'm so, I'm a fag.  You told him to go into the McDonald's.  Yeah, yeah.  Like that wouldn't be your first thought if you were really cold.  Get my dick sucked at McDonald's?  Wait a minute, yes.  But John, listen.  Fuck, thank you, Patrice.  I was really stupid.  I wasn't sure if I should go into this really warm building in your car. 
[00:56:00]  Now that you're telling me, of course I should go in the building.  You deserve the pounding you're about to give me.  But it's like, none of my reaction was your fucking faggot.  It was, it's cold out here.  Huh?  And my mind was trying to think of a way, and this is what I was thinking.  Not get out of here, fag.  It was, hey, I can't, I can't let you warm up in my car.  Yeah.  I mean, God bless you, you're cold and it's a cold day.  But go inside. 
[00:56:30]  I'm surprised you didn't tell the guy.  The holiday spirit.  Look, did they lose their heat in there?  You would need some money for coffee?  Yeah, you dummy.  Wow.  Let's go to Paul the trucker.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  It's what, hold on, hold on, hold on, Paul, sorry.  Yeah, fuck the McDonald's or anything.  He had his own car.  No, I didn't see him.  Warm in his car.  Holy shit, even better, Patrice.  I woke up to see him.  So you didn't know he had the car until later.  I didn't even see this motherfucker. 
[00:57:00]  I woke up to see him at my passenger side with his face in my shit.  But that even confirms it more because let's say he was a fucking drunk and he got thrown  out of McDonald's and that's why he was cold.  Like, you could even rationalize that until he gets in his own car that fucking, like,  has heat.  Someone's making a great point here, Brian in Rhode Island.  Go ahead.  Brian, go ahead.  Hey, didn't Patrice say that it was like three in the morning?  What the hell's this guy doing getting a Christmas tree at three in the morning? 
[00:57:30]  That's, that's, dude, this is the whole.  It might have been his prop.  The whole evil was going through my head like, honey, I'm on the way I work late.  I'm on the way home from blah, blah, blah.  Dude, he had a family because he had a Subaru Outback and a Christmas tree on top.  It's like, it was so, after that is when it kicked in, the creepiness of it kicked in  then.  And I thought of it, what the fuck are you doing out here with a Christmas tree at three? 
[00:58:00]  You just come in, hey, it's four, honey.  You know, I picked up a Christmas tree from the all night Christmas tree place up on Connecticut  Boulevard.  And this mother, man, dude, it's cold out here.  He was on some kind of fucking little business thing where he tells the wife, you know, I'm  going to be working late.  He's just perusing black men porno sites, getting himself all worked up, has the Christmas tree  three in the morning, figures he better get home. 
[00:58:30]  And then he sees the rest stop.  Here we go.  And you're just the prize right there.  I was, I was, I was the grand prize.  Merry fucking Christmas.  You might as well put a bow around your fucking, a mistletoe on your belt buckle.  Merry Christmas.  Oh, here's a black gentleman for you.  It's coming early, baby.  Oh, shit.  And what do you want, successful white man?  I'd like a black gangster cock.  Right here in the rest stop.  And I, and I am so, like, if you don't know me, you know, you know, I just like to dress 
[00:59:00]  that, dress the part, but you know, I'm a comedian, but my whole out thing is like,  uh, you know, giant black dude.  I'm in a tenant up truck.  I got my damn, my hoodie on, my this and that.  Yeah.  And this guy's impression of that would be, I'm not walking up to his fucking vehicle  and asking directions.  I'm not, I'm not going for legitimate purposes to your fucking vehicle and knocking on the  window while you're sleeping.  But, and he just was looking like, I can't, I can't even like describe it on the radio. 
[00:59:30]  Was it a crazy man stare?  It was just looking.  That stare of wanting.  That's fucking up.  Wanting.  But then when he said his, when he, when he made his move, when he made his move, he  didn't look at me.  He turned to the, so his profile was at my window.  His good side.  So when I, when I rolled the window down a little bit, what's up?  And it just, he didn't look me in.  He just, he didn't have the common decency to look you in the eye to ask for the cock.  That's cold out here.  It's cold out here. 
[01:00:00]  All right, let's go to Paul.  He's a trucker.  He has a.  Creepy shit.  Paul the trucker.  What's up?  The rest of the, like, become the new gay bathhouses of America.  But I was in Gwinnett, Georgia, and I stopped, and I was waiting to go pick up a trailer.  And, you know, I was there for about five or six hours.  I went in to use the bathroom, and the phone rings.  You know, the pay phone, and I'm like, okay, whatever.  I keep going.  Come back.  The phone rings again.  I'm like, oh, okay.  I'm pitching myself, thinking I'm on the Twilight Zone.  So I get in the truck, and maybe something to eat, go back out, get a soda out of the  vending machine.  His phone rings again. 
[01:00:30]  I'm like, all right, what's up?  So I'm looking around.  I pick the phone.  The guy's like, it's, oh, suck your cock.  And I'm going, huh, what?  I'm looking around the phone.  Holy Jesus.  So I hang the phone.  I'm walking back, and this cop pulls up, and he's just laughing his ass off.  And I go, what's so funny?  He goes, you answered the phone, didn't you?  And I go, yeah, why?  Because I was watching.  He goes, there's probably some gay guy in a car over here wanting to blow you.  And I was like, what?  He's like, oh, yeah.  He goes, this is like the prime homosexual hangout area.  And they know the pay phone number? 
[01:01:00]  What they do is, yeah, they pull up, and they hit the pay phone number.  Then when you walk by, they dial it, and you pick up.  It's like, you're such a cock.  I was just like, holy Jesus.  Fag's a genius.  Because if I started to beat the shit out of that motherfucker, all he said was, it's  cold out here.  It's cold out here.  Oh, I'll jerk your balls.  Right.  It's like they're so covert.  Just to get in.  Keep up the good work, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Paul.  You know what it's like?  It's like Dracula.  You got to invite him in.  See, it's cold out. 
[01:01:30]  And you had to then invite him in in order to make the next step.  When he knew I wasn't a fag, he immediately bounced.  But it wasn't like, okay, it wasn't like, oh, sorry, he's not a fag.  He left.  Like, you ever see that thing in The Godfather where they say, listen, you don't run, you  don't walk, you don't look no one in the eye, but you don't look away either.  But you don't look away either.  That's how he left.  He just goes, oh, all right.  And walked calmly away. 
[01:02:00]  Like, almost like he knew I would be in shock if I wasn't a fag.  Right.  Don't give you any time to really think about it.  Just leave the situation.  All right, we're back live.  Yes.  A lot of people have arrived since we took a break.  We got Mr. Bob Kelly in studio, Mr. Jim Florentine, and Joe DeRosa.  Not Mr. Joe DeRosa?  Not Mr. Joe DeRosa. 
[01:02:30]  He's still a newbie, so he's just Joe DeRosa.  And, of course, the shitting on each other started the second these two walked in the  fucking room.  Yeah.  Just fucking shitting on each other.  And we got to go to the hotline right away, because Joe Rogan is calling from L.A.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, bud.  Joe.  What's going on?  How you doing, man?  It's just a weird day for everyone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fucked up.  Yeah.  Someone said you played a nice clip and said some stuff on your podcast yesterday, too. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  We played that one.  There's a one clip that really, for me, defines Patrice.  It's when you guys got in trouble for that.  Of course you remember the crazy guy who said all the shit about Condoleezza Rice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Homeless Charlie.  Homeless Charlie, who we fucking loved.  Patrice got on that Fox show with that really humorless lady.  Yeah, for now.  And just annihilated her.  Made her look ridiculous.  Made the whole thing look preposterous.  And defined it in the best way that I heard anybody define all this PC bullshit about going 
[01:03:30]  after comedians and radio DJs for trying to be funny.  You know?  And that it all comes from the same place.  That funny all comes from the same place.  It was brilliant.  The way he said it, the way he put it was brilliant.  The way he handled that dumb cunt was brilliant.  The whole thing was brilliant.  It was just perfect.  It was perfect Patrice.  He killed her with intelligence besides the comedy. 
[01:04:00]  That's what was so brilliant about it.  When she called him a fool, he won.  Yeah.  He goes, oh, name calling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, I'm offended.  I'm offended.  It was so perfect.  You know?  Yeah.  He killed her with intelligence and charm.  And just by being a comic and saying, I'm here speaking for funny.  You know?  And then when she tried to go over his act and paraphrase his act.  And he's like, no, no, no.  That's not what I said. 
[01:04:30]  And then he goes and does the whole angry pirate thing.  Oh, shit.  That was hilarious.  I said, you ejaculate her eye and then you kick her in the shin.  And she walks around like an angry pirate.  Ah!  And then people were laughing on the crew.  And he's like, how are you laughing?  This woman was outraged.  Oh, god damn.  That was fucking funny.  That's a great way to deal with somebody.  That's how you deal with a dummy like that from now.  Yeah.  You don't cower to them or bow to them.  If you're belligerent about it, they really have no recourse. 
[01:05:00]  And that's what he did.  And he destroyed her.  Yeah, it was vintage Patrice.  And that guy liked him.  That John Gibbs really liked Patrice.  He would have him.  I think Fox got mad at that.  But John Gibbs really loved Patrice.  Well, John Gibbs had to do an apology for Patrice's performance.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't want to.  You could just tell he was in a bad spot.  And then unfortunately, Patrice is sticking up for us and comedians in general.  And like you said, Joe Funny.  And it turned out that Fox never used him again.  But that was Patrice.  He didn't give a fuck. 
[01:05:30]  He didn't care.  He didn't care.  Yeah, what he did was better than Fox using him a hundred times.  Right.  Towing their company line.  Right.  One of my favorite parts is when Patrice was like, I speak for funny.  He goes, you speak for people that stand in front of that thing.  Oh, today.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  He likes to find that guy's life.  Yeah.  Fucking life is 40 hours a week.  He gets in front of a fucking camera and does that.  And Patrice just made him look preposterous.  Right.  You know. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  He spoke for funny.  He fucking said it.  And that was true.  He spoke for funny.  She had no idea what she was in for when she, cause she probably like, and I was saying  earlier in the show, the worst thing you could do with Patrice is not realize what a bright  guy he was because he was really a brilliant guy.  And, and she didn't understand that he was a smarter person than she was.  And he was going to run circles around her mentally.  Like he's a big, loud guy, but he was going to outthink her.  And he really made an absolute asshole out of her, which was fantastic.  The whole premise was that she was speaking for America, you know, and we are tired. 
[01:06:30]  He's like, who, who?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Name names.  Name one name.  Are you speaking for America?  Are you speaking for America?  Right.  And he could, he dismissed her.  And if anybody knows the face, the Patrice scrunch, the face, the dismissive face scrunch.  Oh, you never want it to be on the receiving end of the dismissive face scrunch.  It would have been a great silent film actor.  Always followed by the Patrice finger. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go away.  Go away.  She's done with you.  Dismissed.  Plowing forward with her pre-rehearsed bullshit.  It was beautiful.  I liked your tweet yesterday, Joe, that Patrice was a thinker, man.  Yeah.  People need to understand that.  Yeah.  Well, you know, people love to categorize people and it's so easy.  And, you know, when you, you have a black comic, you know, and, you know, people automatically  just assume that they fall into a very specific category, you know, and Patrice is just a 
[01:07:30]  brilliant comic.  He was a brilliant thinker.  He was the type of guy that if he wasn't a comic, he would be that dude that you would  like look forward to going to work because if you work with that guy, you know, he was  going to say some funny shit all day while you work together.  One thing that was really great was the fact that he could take this very complicated subject  and I'd be sitting here all geared up for a very in-depth, complicated, let's dissect 
[01:08:00]  this subject thing.  And he would sum it up in one sentence and make you think, fuck, that is it.  Perfect.  Perfect.  It's like when he was talking about the DC sniper on Tough Crowd.  Remember that?  I don't remember.  And he summed it up to a nigger and a Buick.  Just fucking hilarious.  And he pointed out that they beeped the word Buick and kept the word nigger.  He goes, they beeped Buick.  He would have these theories and he would really agree at penning you into a corner and making 
[01:08:30]  his, no matter how wrong he was, I'm telling you, white women don't understand cooking.  And then he would just for 15 minutes convince you, goddammit, he's white.  White women stink in the kitchen.  He almost got me and my wife to do a threesome with him.  He is a motherfucker.  He was awesome, man. 
[01:09:00]  He was awesome.  He was a real unique dude, like truly a one-of-a-kind.  You know, you asked me to find another dude who's like Patrice.  Boy, I can't think of one.  You know, I really can't.  He was very uniquely his own person, a very different dude, you know, a very different  kind of thinker.  He wasn't afraid of being wrong either.  And that's one thing I loved about him is, and he was wrong sometimes.  And, you know, he always made it, even when he was wrong and his argument was wrong, he  was always interesting.  He never gave you a typical or predictable point of view. 
[01:09:30]  Even when it was stupid, it was like, well, I can see why he would say that.  He was amazing at making you understand why he felt the way he felt.  He was a great listener, which is important, you know?  Yeah, but he was a great talker too.  Of course.  I would talk to him for like four hours on the phone.  I remember, I'd go to sleep, and I'd wake up, and he'd still be talking.  You always knew Patrice was done with you too, because he'd call you up and he would  say whatever it was he had to discuss. 
[01:10:00]  And then he'd go like, yeah, man, my relationship's in trouble.  And he'd go, you had to sell it tonight?  All right, scumbag, I get a time to go.  I fucking, my ears were available for your fucking dissertation, and now you've got to  call someone else and repeat yourself.  Fucking creep.  You're awesome, dude.  Yeah, that fucking sucks.  Yep.  It's very sad, man.  Yeah, well, you know, Stan Hope and I were on the phone yesterday, and I called him up, 
[01:10:30]  and I'm like, did you hear about Patrice?  He's like, yeah.  And, you know, we realized there was nothing to say, so we just go, sucks.  Fucking sucks.  Yeah, that's all you can really say.  And then he said about it.  He goes, you know what?  It's better that than him not being able to talk.  Oh, yeah.  That's been something a lot of people have said too, yeah.  Yeah, for Patrice, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  Can you imagine the torture of not being able to point out the stupid shit that you see  all around you?  I know, right?  And not even the talking, too.  It's like, to not be able to, like, communicate. 
[01:11:00]  Like, if you can't, like, even to little things like nodding or gesturing, where you can  at least let people know what you want, and anything that happens, people would know  is because you want it to happen.  That would kill him, too.  If he could just nod, and we had to just fucking Voss yapping to him at a coffee shop.  Oh, you'd see him just crack his own neck.  Just fucking throw his head on the pavement.  When you think about trying to replicate him, you know, when you think about trying to replace 
[01:11:30]  him, that's when you realize how special that dude was.  Like, imagine someone trying to take that.  Nah, impossible.  He never, even when I met him in Boston, you know, I met him, me and Billy and Dane.  20 years ago, right, Bobby?  Yeah, we, I met him in a, remember the BCN comedy riot, Joe?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We were all in it together, and he showed up, and he's just, you know, it's Boston, but  he was this big black dude.  He, there was never a race around him, though.  No.  He'd hang out with Patrice. 
[01:12:00]  I mean, I used to drive him to his house in Roxbury, and it was never like, oh my god,  I'm driving a black dude back to the project.  It was just driving Patrice home.  He was always just Patrice.  He was never.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, not to say that, like, he didn't, you know, bring up blacks up, or he wasn't  black, but he, it was never a, like, you know, I'm black, you're white.  It was just fucking Patrice all the time.  Yep.  Yeah, he didn't fall into that easy box.  There's an easy box to fall into when you're a black comic.  You know, you start doing black comedy.  You know, a lot of, a lot of black comics will tell you, too, like, that they get pressured 
[01:12:30]  to do a certain type of comedy to fit in on Chocolate Monday or Fat Tuesday or whatever  those all black shows are, you know.  Uh-huh.  He never did that.  It was, it was just Patrice.  You're right.  No, the crowd was always diverse every time you saw him.  I remember, though, he, he, we, talking on the phone, you could talk about shit, and it  wasn't like a fucking, you know, you talk to comics, it's like, that's a bit, you should  do that, and it's like, shut the fuck up.  If you ever did that with him, he'd be like, motherfucker.  I'm gonna talk to you. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  We were talking one day, how do you tell if Japanese people are gay?  Because he was, he was like, you'd have to go, dude, you, uh, you, uh, you like pussy?  Oi.  You, uh, you like, you like sucking dick?  Oi.  You could talk to him about bullshit for hours, nothing.  The dumbest thing.  You could discuss for hours.  Hours.  I remember, he had so many phases, too. 
[01:13:30]  He would tell you, you fucking, he'd make fun of you for something, and then a month later  show up with the same hat, and you'd be like, you motherfucker, he'd be like, yeah, we can  do.  It's cool, it's cool now.  He'd say it's cool now, though.  He bought my watch.  This motherfucker called me on the, you know, my big Breitling that I've had, it was the  first thing I bought when I got any money at all.  And everybody, he gave me shit, dude, what do you need such a fucking big watch for?  I like, whatever.  He called me up with it, what kind of watch you got?  Like, it's a Breitling Super Avenger, it's all, you know, the white face, it's great. 
[01:14:00]  And then he showed up the next time, he had the exact, the exact same watch.  And it's not a Timex, it's like, it's like $3,000.  Gotta go out of your way.  And then he told me not to wear his watch.  He's like, stop wearing my watch in public, man.  And people, people believed it was his watch.  His phases were true.  Like, he went through the fucking football jersey phase. 
[01:14:30]  I watched the old tough crowd clips.  And, you know, he always thought that was his thing.  He would wear the fucking, the Dolphins hat and the Dolphins jersey.  And then all of a sudden, he was a fucking, putting on the rich with his stupid big hats.  He had his fucking extra long suits.  He walked in the cellar one night with a suit on and one of those fucking hats.  I said, are you coming up with your own barbecue sauce?  He's very rarely, he never really caught a full pounding, though. 
[01:15:00]  He always, I've gotten full poundings.  I've gotten to the point where I've thrown clothes out.  Like, I went home and talked to my wife and she was like, it's alright, maybe you should find new friends.  He never, his laugh would diffuse all that.  Like, when you're trying to get at him and then he would just kill the whole mood with one big over the top laugh.  You're like, fuck.  And he was so loud.  Right.  Yeah, I remember the first time I met him, I do, I'm at the comedy cellar and I do a set and I guess he's following me. 
[01:15:30]  So he's in the hallway and I walk out and he's just shaking his head.  He's like, you drove in for Jersey for that?  And he pulls a 20 out.  He goes, here's some tall money.  I feel bad for you.  That was the first time.  I'm like, what a fucking dick.  And then he just starts to laugh.  Come here, man.  I'm like, fuck you.  He's like, oh, come here.  Come here.  And he just started laughing.  He's like, man, that was fucking awful.  That was fucking awful.  Never forget that.  He was definitely able to tread that line between being just a complete scumbag and being unbelievably charming. 
[01:16:00]  He was.  Somehow he was charming after that and I talked to him.  Yeah, how the fuck is that possible?  The first time I met him was at the cellar.  I was like a year into comedy and I was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in New York.  Oh, he'll knock that right out of you.  I walked in.  I had really, like, curly, like, fro-y hair and a big, bushy beard.  And him and Keith were talking and I kind of knew Keith.  And I wanted to chime in with my stupid whatever.  And I go, you know what I think?  And he just looks at me with the scrunchy face that you were talking about, Jim. 
[01:16:30]  And he goes, shut the fuck up, you halfway through a werewolf transformation.  Oh, that's brutal.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  I didn't speak for, like, six months in the cellar after that.  No, you shouldn't have.  That's fucking hilarious.  Oh, goddamn.  Goddamn.  His take on things was always so different. 
[01:17:00]  It was always so, like, whoa, okay, and there's that, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Pull it out of nowhere.  Yeah, things you just wouldn't fucking think of.  Yeah, right.  He's one of the funniest guys on the...  Oh, ever, ever.  I mean, no, I mean, I watch, you can watch all the greats, Chris Rock, all those fucking  guys.  He's, he's, I think he's funnier and up there with all of them.  Yeah.  Especially in person.  It's just the industry, if the industry gave him a pass, if somebody said you, because  he didn't want to do it on anybody else's terms. 
[01:17:30]  He, you know, he didn't want to fucking play ball and feel like shit because he fucking played  ball with people that he regularly wouldn't like and that he was funnier than, and he  knew he was, he knew funny and they didn't.  If he, if they gave him just a shit, he would be the biggest thing of all time.  That's why I said he only deals with mid-level Jews.  Talking about the mid-level Jews.  He can handle them.  Well, I'll tell you, his last Comedy Central special was pretty fucking good, man.  It was, oh yeah. 
[01:18:00]  It was great.  It was a real, true representation of what he's capable of doing, you know, and so oftentimes,  you know, we know a lot of guys who never really get that one special that sort of kind  of defines their act, but he nailed it.  He nailed it in that Comedy Central special.  Yeah, that was a good one.  He was a good one.  And stop, if you, I know you guys are passing that around, but go fucking buy it.  Yeah.  Don't just watch the whole fucking thing.  No, we were saying that before.  Just like that.  Yeah.  Because the money's going to go toward his family.  I get it.  Yeah.  Go buy it and spend the money and have it and own it and fucking support Patrice's family. 
[01:18:30]  Are you guys going to do any benefit shows or anything?  No, we're never going to do that.  No way.  Not for free.  Not for free.  I'm kidding.  If they give out, like, cool iPads, I'll do it.  Yeah.  I'll mail it.  I got to check for $2.50 waiting.  Yeah, I'm sure we'll wind up doing something.  Sure.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, we're going to do something.  This is just so new.  We'll figure it all out.  He, he, uh...  Oh, I forgot what I was going to say.  Oh.  He, uh...  He, uh...  Dude, I got a question.  Did you guys ever see him bummed out?  Ever?  All the time.  Sure.  I saw him. 
[01:19:00]  Really?  I remember in L.A.  He actually taught me, uh...  He...  Patrice was so fucked.  What do you mean all the time?  Well, because we talked all the time.  We're always fucked.  We're comics, you know?  These comics are always miserable.  It's...  He should have been...  He shouldn't have...  He told me.  He said, dude, I shouldn't be...  I should be more famous than I am.  I shouldn't be friends with you.  Like...  He's like, I love you, Bobby, but I shouldn't be able to...  I shouldn't be...  You shouldn't be... 
[01:19:30]  I shouldn't be as accessible to you as I am.  Like, you can just call me.  But, uh...  Yeah, man.  I remember when in L.A.  He was staying with me in L.A.  And, uh...  He was...  I was staying in the Culver City at a one-bedroom.  And he...  He...  We both did this competition.  And he went...  He went forward in it.  And he...  Of course...  Of course he did.  He...  You know.  And, uh...  He was staying on...  He had to come back out.  He's staying on my couch.  And now I'm not in the competition.  He wanted rides to this... 
[01:20:00]  He wanted me to drive him to the Laugh Factory.  I was in the competition.  I didn't get picked.  Now you want me to drive you?  But he actually schooled me.  He was like, yeah, that's what friends do, you fucking piece of garbage.  You drive me.  You let me stay at your house.  You let me...  You feed me.  That's what you...  And I was like, oh, okay.  You're right.  You're fucking right.  That's what we do.  We fucking help each other.  And, uh...  I remember he came home after doing it, and he did well, and he just was like...  He was so...  He didn't know if he got it, and he didn't think he did, because something happened. 
[01:20:30]  It wasn't a perfect set, and I remember he was so fucked up, like, just give me a fucking  break.  Like, and this was years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  And it just gave me one fucking break.  I can't...  They wanted him to cut something out of his act.  And if he did it, he would compromise his set and what he thought was funny.  Oh, okay, yeah.  And if he didn't, it would be good for his...  To go on in the competition.  And he didn't.  He didn't.  He didn't.  And they fucking let him do his thing, and he got in, and he got the Showtime special. 
[01:21:00]  So, I mean, that's one of those defining moments where you cut it, and I...  Look, I...  Yeah, I'll cut it.  Go ahead.  I just want to be liked and fucking on TV.  Right.  Most guys would do that.  Most guys would go, whatever you want.  Whatever you gotta do.  He would take...  That's why people didn't understand him.  He would take that moment and go, if I do this, I know it's not a big deal, but if I  do this, I'm changing who I am, who I think I am, and I can't fuck you.  I'm not cutting anything. 
[01:21:30]  You think he was stubborn in that way, or...  It wasn't...  I think it's a point in life where you gotta choose who the fuck you are.  People always felt like, God, just make that tiny little change, but to him, it felt  like a massive...  And it's a snowball effect, too.  Once you make one compromise, then you're gonna just keep doing it.  But he was, at times, uncompromising in an unreasonable way, and he would tell you that.  Like, there's times where he would look back and probably go, like, ah, I wish I had played  the game a little bit, because it is a business, and you have to do certain things that he wasn't  good at doing, and he would say that. 
[01:22:00]  Like, he knew that.  Yeah, my friend was an audio guy on this Comedy Central pilot that him and Vosted, I think  they were, like, roasting people at a wedding or something like that.  Disney All-A-2, and he said that, you know, Patrice had his mic on, he was listening,  abused these Comedy Central executives when they came down to watch the pilot and give  notes.  He goes, I never heard a fucking bashing before in my life.  Ultimately, the pilot never got picked up.  He's like, I respect that guy, man, because he just told him, that shit ain't funny.  I ain't fucking doing it.  Why are you here? 
[01:22:30]  Why are you, you, where, you, you have a pocket watch.  Go home.  It's crazy.  It's a big guy's there, too, and the pilot never got picked up.  He's like, I respect that motherfucker.  It's like web junks.  I mean, that's the Tosh 2.0 that he's getting millions of dollars from.  Right, right.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  And he was like, you know, he got into a problem with them, and he was like, I don't know, fuck  you.  And they, I mean, I would have fucking, yep, whatever you want, sir, everybody in this  room would have fucking bent over and took it in the ass.  Most people we know certainly would have made the changes, but that wasn't Patrice.  No. 
[01:23:00]  He had such a, he had such a, like an, like a firm understanding, too, with the realities  of that, which, you know, he would always say, like, look, man, if you want to walk that  righteous road, you got to take the lumps.  Like, you got to be ready to lose money and whatever.  And he would talk about, like, if somebody at a club, when he was coming up, would say,  Patrice, don't do that bit where you say cunt or whatever.  And he'd go, you know, is it a big deal for me not to do the bit?  Not really.  But it's just a matter of, I can't allow you to tell me to not do it.  Because once I open that door a little bit, then it swings open and it never, you know 
[01:23:30]  what I mean?  It's just the floodgates are open.  You know?  And a lot of guys aren't familiar with that the way he was.  A lot of guys go, I want to be the fucking rebel, but I also want to be loved by everybody.  He was also defensive sometimes when he did, like, he would do that, because, you know,  everybody wants to succeed and do well.  And then when he realized, like, hey, this group actually likes me, then he would just  think, oh, okay.  Like, he, a lot of times was more defensive than he needed to be, because more people were  going to like him and be comfortable with him than he thought.  Well, he said that one time.  He goes, I'd rather make you feel uncomfortable than I feel uncomfortable. 
[01:24:00]  You know, then you make me feel uncomfortable.  Like, people come into the room, the execs and the big, powerful people, and you'd feel  fucked up.  He says, I'd rather just immediately make him feel like a piece of shit than me sitting  there feeling like a piece of shit, which may be wrong, may hurt him, may, I don't know,  but it fucking makes sense.  I mean, it was hilarious to watch when some important fucking douche would walk in the  room.  He goes, look at you.  Fucking short.  Is that a wig?  We had such a fight when we were fucking taping the Colin Quinn show on NBC. 
[01:24:30]  It was, uh, there were three episodes and I was in two of them with Patrice and we would  do our act.  It was Monday nights at 930 on NBC, on the SNL stage, and it was live.  So you were, it was, you know, Colin would do an opening monologue and opening bits, and  then he did something called Town Hall, which was like Nick DiPaolo and a couple of us,  Keith, myself, Geraldo was in, I think, a couple of them, and Patrice, and we would just  do a bit of our act.  It was like the original Tough Crab. 
[01:25:00]  We were actually doing pieces of our act for, for a couple of minutes each into live  TV.  And I remember I had to go over things with standards and practices, and I was trying  to get something through and fucking, he was standing there just shit talking me and  the woman.  And I'm like, well, look, why can't I say this?  It's about race.  And she's like, well, you can't do that.  And he's just like, what are you doing?  And I'm like, shut the fuck up, bullshit.  This is live television, you asshole.  Oh, we had such a fucking fight.  And he was wrong, that one he was wrong about, because he was like, just being him. 
[01:25:30]  And I'm like, dude, I'm fucking, this is standards of practices on NBC.  I'm doing fucking live TV.  Because when he was nervous, because he was nervous, he was, you know, fucking just venting.  Do you remember the fight we got in in Brazil?  I mean, were you there in Brazil?  We had a rule in Brazil, if you got a lady of the evening, you put her in a car behind  you, because they'll, you know, they're a bunch of fucking criminals. 
[01:26:00]  You know what I mean?  You don't want them throwing drugs and blaming you.  And there's roadblocks everywhere, especially on the weekends.  The cops just set up a roadblock.  They look in, see a tourist with one of the girls, and they pat you down.  Then you get to pay him off.  I, I, we had this rule, but Patrice was Patrice, you know, the fucking mayor of Brazil, fucking  Rio de Janeiro.  After one day.  Well, he spoke fucking two Portuguese words, and it sounded like he spoke fluent Portuguese.  Because he would slow it down.  He'd go, um, uh, tuta, tuta, tuta ben, uh, uh, obrigado. 
[01:26:30]  What the fuck?  Shut up.  He really thought he was a man about town.  It's like, they want your money, asshole.  You guys were doing gigs in Brazil?  No.  Fucking hookers.  We're banging $30 whores.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was three to one back then, too, right?  Dude, we would take fucking 100 milligram Viagras and go to the whorehouse and just not 
[01:27:00]  come until, like, the third or fourth girl, because once you blew the load, you know, you  were done.  And I remember me and him standing there in our robes upstairs in fucking, uh, whatever  that thermos was.  Monte Carlo.  Monte Carlo.  And I had a fucking 100 milligram Viagra hard-on poking out the front of my fucking  robe.  And you couldn't see my dick, but you could see the tent.  And me and him were just standing there, and we're both just looking at the tent in my  robe.  And we're howling at exactly where we are and what we're doing.  We're like in a third world country taking dick pills and fucking prostitutes for $20 
[01:27:30]  American dollars.  Holy shit.  You blew in for that?  Oh, my God, yes.  You didn't hear about the Brazil years?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Joe.  That was like a two, three-year period with these guys.  Joe, more than once.  Yeah.  How many years was it?  It was about a three-year period.  No, it was when we were off the air.  I never went once we came back on, because I felt like I had too much to lose, and things  could go wrong so quickly there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think we did three trips.  Once, I stayed in the Sheraton, and twice, the Rio Othone.  The Othone.  Yeah.  Yeah, but Patrice, he, man, and Brazil, oh, God, was he funny. 
[01:28:00]  I remember the last day we ran around and just took pictures of everything for our families  like we spent a while.  Oh, like you were really there on vacation.  I had changes of clothes.  I was like, let me put this shirt on.  I'm up with the fucking Christo, the Jesus statue.  That's hilarious.  We would, we got in the fucking car.  We're in the car.  He puts one of the, he, these cars are small.  The cabs are real small, right?  They're just these small little shit cars.  Yeah.  He gets in the front.  You imagine how big he is. 
[01:28:30]  Then he throws his girl in the back with me.  With me.  And the rule is, no whores in the same car.  And I'm going, Patrice, don't put the girl, put her in the car.  She doesn't want to go in the car by herself.  She wants to go with Patrique, right?  He goes, get in the car.  And I'm like, Patrice, get her out of the car.  And get her, and he's, we're driving, just go, go.  And all of a sudden, he goes, shut the fuck up, Bobby.  And very rarely, her, Patrice, snap for real.  Yeah.  And I'm like, you shut the fuck up. 
[01:29:00]  Then we look, and there's a roadblock.  Just cops.  And I'm like, great.  Oh, fuck.  And they pull us over, and he's nervous now.  Everybody's shit in their pants.  They got fucking machine guns.  But their finger is on the trigger, which is, you're not supposed to.  Have your finger on the trigger.  So they take us out, and Patrice is, everybody's fucking, I'm in like, you fucking cocksucker.  A Brazilian prison.  We're gone.  We're gone.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  And he's out there.  They got the girl out there.  They're talking Portuguese to the girl.  You don't know what she's ratting us out, throwing us under the bus.  The fucking cab driver, Patrice.  And then they get to me.  I get a thousand real in my pocket.  Which, they're taking that.  That's fucking gone.  You know?  And then they, I tried to assimilate, because I'm such a worm.  I tried to, because I have puffy lips, and I might look a little Spanish.  I tried to, I just said, see?  Because I didn't know.  Oh, God.  I said, look.  But I said, I see. 
[01:30:00]  You understand, they have guns on us.  Okay?  The guy's patting me down.  He touches every pocket.  I'm like, see?  See?  I said, see, around 87 times.  All of a sudden, on the 50th, see, you hear Patrice go, pfft.  He starts losing it.  Oh, shit.  You get back in the car, he goes, you fucking idiot.  He's like, if you said see one more time.  Oh, shit.  Fucking fuck. 
[01:30:30]  He is a funny motherfucker, man.  Just picture some foreigner being frisked by the NYPD, just standing there going, yes,  yes, yes.  What an idiot he'd look like.  That was you, Bobby.  I was scared.  I was scared.  Fucking hilarious.  You know, Patrice would talk his way out of jail.  You guys would actually do a fundraiser to fucking get a lawyer to get him out.  You'd leave me there.  We're working on it, Kelly.  You'd love it.  That was a fucking gay joke. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Well, this sucks.  Yeah, it fucking blows me.  I'm going to miss him a lot.  Yeah, everybody is, definitely.  Well, Mr. Rogan, anything else, sir?  Oh, nothing, man.  You know, what can I say?  It's a unique friendship that comics have with each other.  You know, there's very few people like us.  You know, the only people that are like us are you guys, who are radio DJs.  You're essentially the same thing.  You're just doing it on the radio instead of doing it at a comedy club. 
[01:31:30]  Needy creeps.  Needy creeps.  That's all we all are.  Needy, damaged creeps.  Damaged, needy fucking messes.  Right.  Disasters.  We are the best and worst of humans.  You only get us if you fuck us up when we're young.  Yeah.  That's true.  You have shitty parents and shitty situations growing up.  You know, the beautiful thing is it creates, you know, MMA fighters, stand-up comic musicians, 
[01:32:00]  anybody who's like, you know, really fucking determined to express themselves.  Trying to hide all this shit inside a rolling paper outer crust.  It's just fucking barely, barely there.  When they stopped Sandusky when he was fucking that kid, they're like, what are you doing?  He's like, I'm making a comic.  That kid's going to be brilliant.  In the last 10 years.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, Joe, well said, brother. 
[01:32:30]  Well said.  Well, you know, there's nothing we can say that's going to make this good.  It's just he was awesome.  He was awesome when he was alive.  And, you know, I'm just happy I got to know him.  I wish I knew him more.  I wish I was around him more.  You know, I had already left Boston, but when he was coming up, and, you know, I already  left New York when he was there.  I was already in L.A.  You know, but when I did get to hang out with him, it was awesome.  It's weird.  It's like, it's funny.  It's like, I'm grateful.  I said to somebody, like, I had a very complete friendship with him. 
[01:33:00]  Like, there's nothing that I say, like, I wish I had said this.  Right.  I wish I had expressed that.  Like, we traveled together.  We did gigs together.  You said that to me.  Oh, is it to you?  Yeah, apparently we don't have that, but go ahead.  No, you're like, I'm right here, Jim.  I'm right here.  I remember it.  You should.  You told me that last week, too.  Oh, okay.  I didn't remember.  Fucking shit friend he is.  What?  It's Mike.  I don't know who I said it to, but I had a complete friendship with, uh, fuck you. 
[01:33:30]  I didn't remember.  You were just a big pair of fat ears I was saying it to.  Sorry.  I guess I should have, I should write down in a notebook, send to Bob.  All right, so, all right, so listen.  I was talking to this fat fuck that I know.  And I say, oh, sorry, Bob.  And, uh, but it's like you look back on it, and I'm like, I'm really happy that I was friends  with him, and I'm really, like, happy that I didn't, we did that shit together. 
[01:34:00]  And it's like, I don't look back and go, fuck, I wish I had said that, man.  Like, you look back with regret, and there was none.  There's not one thing that when he was in the hospital, I'm like, I have to say this  to him, or I have to get this point, because he knew.  I mean, I knew how much he liked me, and he knew how I felt about him.  It was complete.  It was a real, complete relationship.  He was fucking great, man.  That's all you could ask for.  Yeah, yeah.  He was fucking calling you up for his barbecue, and be like, yo, he actually called you and  thanked you for coming to the barbecue.  Yeah.  Which is like, dude, for all the shit that people say about him, like, he's this, and 
[01:34:30]  he's that, and he's this big motherfucker, and he makes fun of people, and he's mean  to people.  He wasn't.  He was funny all the time.  All the time.  And funny, that's what funny is, is fucking making fun of people and being as honest as you  possibly can.  But he was also the nicest, one of the nicest guys I know.  He would call you up and go, yo, I just want to call you up, and thank you for coming  by, man.  I appreciate you coming by to my barbecue.  It's like, what?  He fucking cooked at my barbecue for hours for a bunch of people.  He didn't know most of them, and just cooked there because he just enjoyed doing it. 
[01:35:00]  You're a racist.  And then when he was done.  You're a racist.  I'm such a racist.  You had him do that.  I just like, yeah, get to work.  Get to work.  Do you make him wear a pancake hat?  Yeah.  Fucking period, cocksucker.  Yeah.  He can come if he cooks.  Yeah.  He's going to cook, because I won't have it.  The only way I'll let you in my house.  Way to spin it today.  The only thing he asked for when he was done is like, I just want me and my chick to go  in and, yeah, Kool-Aid and Cheetos.  He goes, I just want me and my chick to be able to watch a movie in the theater. 
[01:35:30]  Really?  And I went downstairs, and there were like five kids in the theater watching some shit.  Yeah, Uncle Paul.  And I just walked in there, and I shut the movie off.  I was like, all right, Ollie is out.  Out.  And Patrice is like, you're not going to do it.  I'm like, no, no.  I'm doing that.  Get out of here.  Jesus, Joe, is that your fucking sinuses?  What's that noise?  Joe.  Joe, me?  Yeah, you.  No, I'm not saying anything.  I'm just sitting here.  No, I can hear you breathing in your fucking nose into the microphone.  His phone needs a windscreen. 
[01:36:00]  It sounds like you're trying to blow yourself in a tub.  I can't hear anything.  No, it's just like, that's what a man breathes like.  He really is a man.  Bobby's heard that on the back of his neck.  Yeah, exactly.  Is it weird to hear that breathing without, don't tell your mother?  You brought it up, man.  This motherfucking room can spin really fast. 
[01:36:30]  It's a horrible place.  It's a horrible place.  Jesus Christ.  I was walking over today with a girl, and she's like, that's really nice that everybody's  going in to talk about Patrice.  And I go, it is nice, but it is going to be the most evil fucking room.  No, it's never going to be nice, nice.  It's going to be everybody trashing each other.  We all got together down the cellar last night, and it just, it was literally a couple minutes  of, man, it sucks.  What's up?  How you doing?  And then nice shirt.  Yeah.  Fucking stupid.  And then it just fucking unraveled. 
[01:37:00]  It was just, it was the most, it was fucking.  Again, incapable of just keeping that moment and emotion.  I know, I kind of like that.  You guys can tip your toes into emotion, but that's about it.  It's not true.  It's really not true, man.  I mean, it's weird.  I've had some, I think we're the most, we just don't do it in public.  Publicly.  But I've talked to fucking him, I've talked to, you know, I've talked to Patrice.  I mean, some serious, deep, I think we're fucking crazy.  That's one of the things that fucks us is that we have so, we're so emotional. 
[01:37:30]  We have such fucking light skin.  It's like fucking the crust of a, of a fucking tapioca pudding.  It's just fucking mushy douchebags we are.  He's trying to make a thin-skinned analogy.  Always brings it back to food, doesn't he?  It's like the crust of a delicious tapioca with a little brown sugar on it.  Cinnamon.  I like cinnamon.  Speaking of which, can you guys send an order out right now?  I'm starving.  I know we can get some food for a moment.  There's nobody in this room in shape, except for Anthony. 
[01:38:00]  No, well.  Florentine's in shape.  Look at Florentine's arms.  Let me see.  Look at Florentine's arms.  Let me see.  It's all right.  Take his shirt off, Jim.  No, but I wanted to say about Patrice.  I mean, you know, he did have a serious side.  Like, my ex-girlfriend passed away, and he was close to her.  He loved her.  He's like, she was my favorite.  And he called me, like, three days a week for, like, the first month.  Oh, wow.  And I was afraid to pick up the phone the first time, because I really thought he was just going  to tear into me.  Oh, shit.  You ain't over that shit.  Yeah, ain't you fucking up, bitches. 
[01:38:30]  But he would just call, and we'd talk, and talk like that.  So, you know, he did show a human side.  And then about three months later, he's like, you ain't over this shit yet.  Get the fuck out there.  I'm going to tell you what a fucking piece of shit he could be, too.  I'm going to tell you a story right now that I've never told anybody.  I got a couple more.  I got, like, four more piece of shit stories.  Piece of shit stories.  This is, and I love them so much, and I understood them so well that I let this go.  But anybody else should have never talked to this fucking idiot.  My wife, last year, I think it was last year, not this year, October, the last October, she 
[01:39:00]  planned a surprise birthday party for me.  Huge, okay, event.  It was supposed to be 100 people and fucking burlesque dancers.  And then Geraldo passed away on the night that the party was supposed to take place.  So she had to cancel.  That was his wake.  Oh, right.  She had to cancel it and make it, you know, literally at the last second, rearrange everything  and make it into a small restaurant.  And she could only afford a couple, you know, like a small amount of people.  She wanted to roast you. 
[01:39:30]  She wanted us to go up and roast you a little bit and fuck with you.  It was going to be huge.  A huge event.  And she told all my friends, Patrice called me up days before, two days before the party  and went, Bobby, and I was like, what's up?  He goes, I got to tell you something, man.  And I'm like, what's up, man?  He goes, you know, your wife's planning a surprise party for you, right?  And I'm like, what?  What the fuck?  And he goes, I just want to let you know, man, because I don't like surprises.  And he goes, I don't know if you like surprises like that. 
[01:40:00]  I don't know if you like that type of shit.  So I'm just, and I go, maybe you should have opened with, do you like surprises?  And I would have said, yes, I love fucking surprises.  I'm a lonely piece of shit.  I love surprises.  He was looking out for you.  I fucking knew you knew.  I fucking knew you knew when you walked in.  I was like, he's not surprised.  Whoa, what a surprise.  I wasn't expecting this. 
[01:40:30]  This is what he said.  He was like, oh, shit, I'm sorry.  I go, look, Patrice, you're a fucking piece of shit.  You're just a fucking dummy.  I go, what?  Why would it matter what you think in my life?  You fuck.  He was like, oh, fuck me, man.  Oh, he knew he fucked up.  Oh, he knew he fucked up.  He was trying to take care of you.  He goes, can you just don't say anything?  Just act.  I go, oh, fuck.  Now you're saddled with that.  I walked into the fucking party.  I had to pretend I'm surprised to my wife. 
[01:41:00]  I just looked at him, and he just did a little smirk because he saw my shitty acting.  Well, I didn't know you weren't surprised, nor do I give a shit now.  Your level of surprise is a valueless thought to me.  I don't think we should.  I think the surprise should have been that the party just got canceled, and you walk in  there alone, asshole.  That's what kept you room.  You're in your 40s.  No, you're in your 40s. 
[01:41:30]  Exactly.  No more surprise parties.  Sorry, we didn't have the little fucking hat for you.  Damn it, they got a hat with a four and a zero.  Oh, God.  That fucking hurts, piece of shit.  That fucking hurts.  Yeah.  Joe, he's an asshole.  I think it's awesome that you have a form like this, where you can actually talk about  them real.  Yeah.  You know, if you were on a regular fucking radio show, or if you were, you know, forced  to do some TV show just a decade ago, you would have had a horse shit through it.  Yeah.  You couldn't really be real or use every word in your vocabulary, you know? 
[01:42:00]  You know, it's so appropriate that we get to talk about this guy in this form.  Absolutely.  Yeah, and it feels good, because that's exactly the type of guy he was.  He didn't want you to soft-soap it or bullshit.  Yeah.  I mean, I've been crying almost every night for a month.  I mean, it's like, you know, it's not like, you know, comedians don't...  We're all fucking a wreck over it.  It's fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  I've been claustrophobic.  I haven't been able to sleep.  I've been waking up just thinking of him laying there.  Like, it's been a fucking nightmare.  I have dreams. 
[01:42:30]  I have dreams that he's actually...  He gets up.  I've been having dreams for the last month that he's up, and we're hanging out, and he's  a little fucked up, and he's got a cane, but we're talking, and he's...  And then you wake up, and you're like, ah, fuck.  You know, you start crying, and you're like, what the fuck?  Yeah, it's a motherfucker.  Yeah, that's always the weirdest thing when someone passes, when you have dreams about  them being okay.  Yeah.  And then, you know, I had a few dreams about Phil Hartman after he died, you know, that  were like, oh, for people to know, his wife shot him in his sleep and then shot herself.  You know, and it was really fucked up at the time. 
[01:43:00]  I had never known anybody that got shot before.  It was, you know, especially someone who got shot by someone else I knew, but I would  have all these dreams about him being alive.  And then you wake up, and I'm like, god damn.  You know, it's just the weirdest fucking feeling to have a dream about someone that you really  love and care about, and then they're gone.  And then you're in the dream that you're talking to them, and it's just like the old  times.  And you're like, man, I didn't really appreciate those fucking old times as much as I do now.  It was a letdown, too, when you wake up. 
[01:43:30]  It's so weird, though, because like, after the dream's done and you wake up, you have  the memory of it, so it's almost like you got to hang out with them again.  One more time, yeah.  Because it's a new situation.  Yeah.  It's very odd.  It's very weird.  But then you realize it's just, you know, manifest in your own head, and they had no input  whatsoever.  It was just your dumb fucking idea of the person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got to kiss.  Yeah, Joe, thank you so much for calling, man.  Absolutely.  We really appreciate it.  Good talking to you, buddy.  I'm coming in next week, man.  I'm really looking forward to it. 
[01:44:00]  I got to come to New York and do some bullshit press for Fear Factor, but the thing to me  that was the most important about the trip is that I get to go in and do your show.  Oh, we can't wait.  Yeah, fuck yeah, man.  It's been a while.  Absolutely.  All right, Joe.  See you next week, brother.  Thank you, Joe.  Joe Rogan.  Thanks for saying, man.  Yeah, we're going to take a break.  Some of the listeners are calling him Darth Rogan.  Yeah, well.  He really, that's what a fucking mixed martial artist breathes like.  Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  He breathes like a bull.  Yeah.  And he should.  Big, solid head.  When Chuck was in here, he did the same thing, you know? 
[01:44:30]  It's just how a man that could kill you with his hands breathes.  That's it.  We're my grandfather.  One or the other.  What grandfather?  Huh?  What do you mean your grandfather?  Because old people breathe like that.  Because my grandfather breathes him.  How do you know your grandfather?  Oh, shit.  I thought he was doing an adopted joke.  Oh, fuck.  That's cold.  Funny point, too.  Both?  Bob and Joe.  Yeah.  Right?  What?  Gay?  No. 
[01:45:00]  What, son?  You told him?  What does he do?  I don't remember.  You were adopted, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And you had stepfathers.  Oh, yeah.  I had a stepfather.  Oh, no.  No, I had two stepfathers and one foster father.  Jesus.  But you were adopted or no?  Never adopted.  Hence the fucking need.  No, I never adopted.  Wow.  No, I had two stepfathers and one foster father.  And then one real dad that I haven't talked to in 20 years.  Oh, boy.  Do you know how fucking hilarious it is to watch two best friends, like the two of you,  one of them go, really, Bob?  I thought you were adopted.  To hash out something that is so important in life, it should be known like the first 
[01:45:30]  week you know each other.  But no, no.  That's pretty important.  I've told him that.  I told him.  He knows that.  That's pretty important.  All right.  Florentine just goes, that's pretty important.  But I don't remember because I'm just thinking of all the times we've made fun of you for  not being Irish.  I'm like, oh, I thought you were adopted.  No, that's because Quinn says I look like my great-great-grandmother was raped on the Kyber  past.  Oh, Jesus.  I remember watching Keith Rabbit. 
[01:46:00]  Actually, one of the first things I ever did in New York was you guys...  Stop pointing your fucking thin Dick Van Dyke finger at me.  Oh, you stupid fucking ligaments.  Norton, Bobby, and Keith brought me to open for you guys at a college when I was like a  few months into the city.  It was one of the first things I ever did.  And I was watching them all trash each other outside.  Like, oh, my God, this is the meanest thing I've ever seen in my life.  And Bobby's uncle was there.  And Keith just goes, goddammit, you're not his uncle. 
[01:46:30]  There's a Puerto Rican in this family somewhere.  We're going to get to the bottom of it.  And I was like, you can talk like that to somebody's uncle?  You know what I mean?  Like, I thought you had to be respectful of people's families and shit.  Respectful.  Nah.  The funniest thing, we went to a Dunkin' Donuts.  They're standing at the counter ordering with some kid.  Some 14-year-old girl walks out of the back of the kitchen.  She walks up to Keith and she goes, do you want anything?  And Keith just goes, I want you to shut your trap. 
[01:47:00]  I remember that.  I remember that.  Bobby ran.  I've never seen Bobby embarrassed.  He ran out of the Dunkin' Donuts and he was laughing.  He's going, what the fuck's wrong with you, dude?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You guys did.  Fucking Robinson is funny sometimes.  Not on stage, but in life.  I'm going to shut your trap.  God damn.  He just got you fucking hilarious.  Can I give you anything?  I want you to shut your trap.  Shut your trap.  But, you know, it's obviously a very, very sad thing to know that you weren't surprised. 
[01:47:30]  Shut up, motherfucker.  I never, literally, the only people that know was me and Patrice.  My wife doesn't even know.  And I felt like shit.  But that fucking cocksucker.  But I still, you know what the thing is?  You get mad at them.  And even, you know, we all get mad at each other.  I fucking still, I was like, dude, I still love you, you fucking idiot. 
[01:48:00]  You fucking, the whole concept of the party was a joke.  Because I never had a birthday party.  And fucking DeRosa throws his own party for himself once a year for industry.  You make it for industry?  He's not even talking to his friends.  Keith wasn't even invited one year.  It's just fucking Comedy Central heads.  It's my best friend.  How did you become friends with him?  At one of my birthday parties?  Fuck you.  I might be able to a bar and a drink.  You make it sound like I'm hanging fucking streamers up and, you know, putting out a food spread. 
[01:48:30]  I just put your fucking resume out, too.  Listen, it's a party like Billy Bats.  It's my party.  Don't get nervous.  We should definitely take a break.  Bill Burr is standing by and others.  I want to play the clip Rogan was talking about.  You got that, E-Rock?  Oh, the Fox News one?  The Fox News thing, no.  Sam, can you play it off the fucking internet for us?  Yeah.  Sam, get their stat.  Yeah, quick.  Oh, boy, this is going to take forever.  Rogan was pointing out a clip that really describes what Patrice is all about, and I want to play that. 
[01:49:00]  Most of you have heard this a bunch of times.  It's still great, though.  Yeah, it's worth playing.  Yeah, he was commenting on our suspension for the Homeless Charlie bit when Homeless Charlie was in the studio talking about raping Condoleezza Rice and whatnot.  Right.  And he was on there defending freedom of speech in his own inimitable style.  Right.  And there was a woman from National Organization of Women on it.  Oh, we love those people. 
[01:49:30]  And he just schooled the shit out of her.  It was fantastic.  He talked to her the way she should be talked to.  Right.  Right.  And he was never back on Fox again after that?  No, because he was so dirty.  That's beautiful.  Another bridge gone.  Is this it?  Nick.  Okay, yeah, just play it.  Bill Burr next.  Stay there.  Next up on the chopping block, XM Satellite Radio DJs Opie and Anthony.  They're under fire now for airing joking comments about raping Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. 
[01:50:00]  Will they be the next to go?  Is radio cleaning house after the Imus debacle?  With me now, new city president, now new city president, Sonia Osario.  She took part in a recent protest calling for radio stations to stop supporting negative language in music and talk radio.  And also, our favorite stand-up comic, Patrice O'Neal.  Thank you, sir.  Patrice, are O and A next?  I hope not. 
[01:50:30]  I hope JV, I wish JV and Elvis didn't lose their job or Imus.  It's funny.  This is the thing.  I don't know her, but I'm assuming that she has nothing to do with funny.  So I'm going to speak as the expert on funny.  Funny people should just be left to trying to be funny.  What if they're not funny?  Then you made a mistake.  But how many, listen, how many times has an unfunny, how many unfunny rape jokes lead to rape?  I don't know how many jokes about rape there are.  There's a lot.  But your world is not funny. 
[01:51:00]  Your world is...  Next on the big story.  My world is people trying to be funny.  Well, I mean, you think it's okay to try to make jokes about rape?  I'm diabetic.  I make fun of that.  I'm a victim.  I might lose a toe.  But I'm trying to make fun of anything I think I can make fun of.  Sonia?  You know, what's happening now is the marketplace is deciding what's appropriate or what's not appropriate. 
[01:51:30]  I think the nation is just tired.  There's a new mood in the nation.  What nation?  The nation.  You know what?  We're tired of things that are just...  It's just the nation.  It's paper and you.  I'm not the nation.  I'm just speaking for me and funny.  You're speaking for the nation or are you speaking for...  Yeah.  You know why?  Because I remember six years ago doing something against Anthony Openey because they were just  so outrageous and their violent images that they put out to women was just uncalled for. 
[01:52:00]  And now, now, I think people...  Do you think they were trying to be funny?  I think now people in this country are tired.  Do you think they were trying to be funny?  You know what?  I don't care if they're trying to be funny.  That's what I'm saying.  Let me tell you something.  Why are you in that business?  I've been to your show once and it wasn't very funny being a woman in your show.  When you talked about...  That's why she doesn't like me.  I was in the paper with her and the joke is hilarious called The Angry Pirate.  And the lady who wrote it in her outrage didn't even know what it meant.  And anybody who read it, laugh because they know what's funny.  You're not living in the context of funny. 
[01:52:30]  You're living in the context of fire.  All these guys have every right to be as funny as they want.  They can go out and try to be as funny as they want, make as much money being as funny as they want.  This is what's happening.  There is a change in this country.  People are realizing they have an opportunity to speak out.  And advertisers are listening.  You're not talking.  You're not talking.  You're not talking to who I talk to.  And you're not going to get paid as much money anymore.  Sonia and Patrice, look at this.  That's what it is.  The marketplace is speaking.  More CBS radio firings.  They've been on a tear lately.  All right. 
[01:53:00]  Are they cleaning house or is this the PC cops run amok?  You know what it is, John.  You know what it is while you're reading that paper.  It's the PC cops run amok.  Do you think she's a PC cop?  Of course she is.  She has an entire encyclopedia of her stance on it, but it's no passion involved.  It's not a real.  This is just what she has to say.  We are outraged and fired and fired and fired.  You're a fool.  Name calling.  I'm outraged.  I am outraged.  You should be.  You should be.  I am a fool. 
[01:53:30]  Now, if I called you a fool, ah!  You know what?  People are feeling a new sense of entitlement to decency in this country.  Who are the people?  How can you justify a bad joke, a joke that isn't funny, an attempt that isn't funny,  doesn't get any laughs, and is about raping the first black woman to ever become the Secretary  of State of the United States?  Don't throw that at me.  Well, why not?  The attempt is what I'm trying to fight for. 
[01:54:00]  The joke may or may...  Funny jokes and unfunny jokes come out of the same birth.  You don't know if anything is going to be funny.  You should attempt to be able to make anything funny.  Do you think a joke about rape is doomed to be not funny?  It's possible, but I've heard them.  I've heard them.  You've heard a funny rape joke?  I'd say a couple.  Watch my HBO special.  I'm pretty good at it.  Yeah, Patrice says that if you're having sex with a woman, doggy style, and if you... 
[01:54:30]  Wrong.  Hit her in the head just the right time.  No, it's ejaculating her eye and kick her in the shin, and she walks around like, argh!  It's the angry pirate.  No, no, no.  That's what she was trying to say.  A violent act of hitting her in the back of her head, her body...  It's called the donkey punch.  ...which will then...  Why are you laughing?  She's outraged.  It's called the donkey punch.  It's called humor that she has no clue what it is.  We have the same problem that Opie and Anthony does.  You can't say just anything on the air. 
[01:55:00]  You can say anything you want.  It might not be funny.  You might get in trouble for it, but you should be able to be attempting.  And plus, when is a crazy bum going to get an opportunity to rape the president?  If the president's wife, John, it was trying to be funny.  All right, Patrice.  Why aren't I hearing Al Sharpton complain about this thing involving Congress?  Because it wasn't involving young black women.  Well, it was involving a very prominent black woman.  Well, where was she during young black...  Everybody has their agenda.  I was there.  I was there.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:55:30]  All right.  Excuse me.  But why am I not hearing from Sharpton?  Because it doesn't concern him.  It's not concerning him.  You know, come on now, you know Al Sharpton has his agenda, and it was perfect for Al.  Young black women.  And now she's representing just women in general.  She's not representing the nappy-whole part.  She's representing just the hoe.  The nappy-headed part, she has nothing to do with it.  Just the hoe.  Sonia?  You know what?  Women have been abused publicly in the media for too long, and people are tired of it. 
[01:56:00]  This has been a beautiful response of just the general public saying to advertisers,  we're your consumers.  We don't want to have to avoid everything in the street.  We don't want to have to worry about what radio station we turn on.  And there is some really derogatory, violent thing to deal with.  You're going to get all your information, ma'am, is secondhand from someone making you aware  that someone may have said something that you should be upset about. 
[01:56:30]  It's a shame.  Your constituents, the people you represent aren't all victims in this matter.  I got to go.  Patrice O'Neill, thank you very much.  Sonia Osario, thanks.  The both of you appreciate it.  Time for big politics.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Is that a Gouda cheese?  No, Bob, somebody threw up.  Bobby turns every cent into food somehow. 
[01:57:00]  Bobby had to take one of my Pop-Tarts.  You threw it at him.  He caught it.  And Pop-Tart went flying everywhere.  That was his teeth.  He started eating it.  It is true.  You don't have one Pop-Tart.  You don't have one Pop-Tart.  You don't have two.  He tried to eat like a fucking seal.  Throwing him a fish.  Can you tell the open micers to stop chatting like we're not on the radio?  No, that's just me now.  We're on the radio.  Stop whispering shit, dicks.  Here's the deal. 
[01:57:30]  Let's set the mood here.  We got Bob Kelly eating one of my Pop-Tarts.  We got Colin Quinn has arrived.  Yeah, with his fucking gay coat.  Gay coat?  He borrowed Mary Tyler Moore's jacket.  Where is that?  Put it on.  Put it on.  Show this fucking...  Oh, no.  Look at the buttons.  It is Mary Tyler Moore's.  Wait for the buttons.  He's got fucking wooden buttons.  Is it kind of like military?  No, it's not military.  It's got the military vibe?  No, not really.  Let me see.  It looked like it was going to be a pea coat. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, God.  It's kind of a cool coat.  It's not a cool coat.  Oh, no.  It's those old leather buttons.  Yeah, Tyler Moore's jacket.  Fucking asshole.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Angela Lansbury.  Yeah, why don't you go solve a crime in that, you fucking idiot?  It's a coat bucket.  I'm not sure, man.  Colin's trying to own it.  Colin's trying to own the coat.  And help.  You stepped on your own joke.  We also got Jim Florentine. 
[01:58:30]  We got Joe DeRozan.  Kurt Metzger has arrived.  And Bill Burr waited for the break.  Bill, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  What's going on, man?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Strange day, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's awful.  Awful, awful, awful.  I think yesterday I set the record for laughing and crying.  Every time I start crying, I think about something funny.  And I start laughing.  It's awful.  It's awful.  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  I'm trying to bring it down.  You guys were on a nice roll there.  No, no.  No, no, no.  We've had...  It's what it is.  It's been all over the place all morning.  It sucks.  It's been all over the place.  And you do.  It's like, I wasn't able to really watch a lot of the videos that people were posting  yesterday because, I don't know.  It was tough.  I couldn't do it.  It was kind of sad.  I tried a couple of times, but it was just like, it got too sad.  But then you read some of the shit and you start laughing your ass up because you just  read it in Patrice's voice.  And, you know, that got me laughing pretty good.  I started thinking of all the stuff that he did. 
[01:59:30]  Do you know one time he had a meeting at Comedy Central?  And, you know, you put on your, I'm going to get a deal shirt and you go in there and  you tap dance and you try to sell your stupid idea for a show.  You know, he went in there and spent 45 minutes trashing the executives for putting Mind of  Mencia on the air.  And he just wouldn't let up.  And then that was it.  The meeting ended.  Like that was just basically the, I think he pitched his show in the final three minutes. 
[02:00:00]  He got the opportunity to go in there and decided he was just going to bash the show.  Oh man, that's fucking great.  Yeah.  And at the end, you know, he pitched his show for like three minutes and I remember asking  why he did it.  I go, why would you do that?  And he just started laughing.  I was thinking about all that stuff.  You know, one time I went up with Bobby, do you remember the time that that comedian came  to town, he had the, uh, he had the metal hand. 
[02:00:30]  What?  What the fuck is that?  Wait a second.  I'm going to the airport.  This is my ride.  Hold on a second.  Oh.  Hello.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  Um, I think I went to South instead of North.  Yeah.  So this guy comes to town.  He was missing his left hand.  So he had like one of those three pronged left hand things.  Everybody sees it.  Nobody wants to say anything.  And the great thing was it was his left hand.  So when, when you met the guy, you just stuck out your right hand and there was no problem. 
[02:01:00]  But everybody's thinking what happened to his, what happened to his hand, right?  So after he meets like 10 comics, he then meets Patrice and Patrice, he's the guy.  And when he goes to shake his hand, instead of sticking out his right hand, he sticks out  his left hand.  And the guy with the, with the fake hand, like just out of instinct, stuck out his left hand  and then sort of froze for a second.  And then Patrice with his big, dainty fingers, just grabbed one of the metal tongs and sort  of shook it. 
[02:01:30]  And there was all this awkwardness.  And then Patrice just goes, what happened to your hand, man?  And like, that was, that's why I loved the name of his last special elephant in the room  because that's what he always did.  Yeah.  Just a dress.  You know, you want to sit there and be like, that's rude.  That's insensitive.  And then you're like, dude, that's exactly what I was thinking.  What happened to your hand?  Yeah.  And I was actually psyched that he asked it.  And I don't know, man, I'm going to miss that guy. 
[02:02:00]  Like, I don't know.  It's crazy because it's, you know, I mean, I've known quite a few people that have, that  have left us, but this one is just like, because he's so, he's so fucking irreplaceable,  you know?  Yeah, no, he's, uh, yeah, he's even beyond the description of one of a kind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  One of a kind is almost like hacky at this point.  That's too cliche, right?  Yeah, you're right.  That's what I tweeted yesterday, you redheaded cocksucker, you. 
[02:02:30]  Go fuck yourself, Billy.  What was that?  He's making a good point.  Bobby, do you know something?  Ever since we started doing these stupid movies and this goddamn book, do you know,  I now hate the sound of your voice?  Hey, that wasn't me, you fucking cocksucker.  That was fucking stupid Colin Quinn, you redheaded shit dick.  Was that that cocky feature act?  No, that was fucking Colin Quinn.  You don't recognize that raspy, shitty voice? 
[02:03:00]  Hey.  No offense.  No, I don't.  I'm walking through a gate carrying my bags at five in the morning out here.  Cut me some slack.  And I'm on a droid.  I don't have the iPhone, dude.  Jack Colin, I didn't attack you.  How did Bobby get dragged into this shit?  Yeah, Bobby got too busy eating.  It was Colin Quinn.  Yeah, I thought it was Bobby.  He did, yeah.  Because he said it was a hack line.  He thought it was Bobby, so it was mine.  Huh?  What'd you say?  Nothing.  You trashed me and I missed it. 
[02:03:30]  No, you trashed me.  You called me a hack for saying he's one of a kind.  That was a great, that was a really great, deep sentiment.  Colin, you're so old, your grandfather didn't be using that expression.  Yeah.  And then you followed up with, Patrice was aces in your book.  I thought he was just swell.  He's in cat's pajamas. 
[02:04:00]  Colin said five words since he's come in here.  He's just getting shit on.  As he should.  As he should with that fucking stupid gay Pico.  I don't know what the problem is.  It's a lovely jacket, Bobby.  It's not a lovely, it's a lovely jacket if you're an 85-year-old woman.  Where are you going, Bill?  Going to go do some gig in western Massachusetts.  You know, every time I go, I always get, actually, I still get nervous when I perform out there, 
[02:04:30]  because a long time ago in Lee, Massachusetts, exit two off the Mass Pike,  somebody threw a dinner roll at me when I was performing and doing stand-up in some restaurant.  Oh, shit.  That's pretty degrading.  To who?  That's my fantasy.  I'd like to get paid with those.  Have all five courses thrown at you. 
[02:05:00]  Jesus, Joe.  You're just liking that a little too much there, Bobby.  Why wouldn't that fucking Arab like it?  I like the fact that Bill Burr secretly hates your voice, and that came out.  That makes me really happy.  No, it really did.  Billy's real feelings come out.  Holy shit.  He snapped, right?  Yeah.  Or maybe not.  No, no, no.  But since we started doing stuff together, you guys never, we never call for fun anymore.  It's always like, yeah, we got to edit this thing.  I hate you guys. 
[02:05:30]  What are you doing, a book on tape or something?  No, we're writing a book, stupid.  Oh, sorry.  Like you should have.  Yeah, I know.  You should have wrote a book about your fucking, oh, your midlife crisis.  My ex-flow.  I had midlife crisis going on at 12.  I hope that's...  Dummy wants to buy a jet ski for his pool.  Come on over, guys.  How many parties can you have?  It's never going to fill the hole.  Fuck it, asshole.  Just get old gracefully. 
[02:06:00]  Get a pair of glasses and borrow Fag's coat.  Well, you know...  I'm not sure I like my new nickname.  You don't like that one, Kong?  Fag's coat.  Yes, Jimmy.  It is.  If you're writing a book with Bobby, I hope that someone is doing the spell check.  Because it was very sad yesterday.  We were all telling each other before the news broke.  Oh, my God.  And, you know, it's always nice when Matt Frost called me.  But when you get a text from Bob Kelly, can you read that right there under the photo? 
[02:06:30]  I said he wished he could.  You can't.  Get his glasses.  Oh, God.  Yeah, okay.  Can I guess it?  Wait, wait.  Wow, you're squinting bad.  Wow.  Anthony.  Boy, my sick.  Anthony, we're on radio.  They don't know you can't see.  I can't see.  Wait, you can't read that?  No, I can.  I have to squint, though.  You want me to read?  Really bad.  Yeah, just, uh, I really, I put off, I put off, I put off, right under the picture.  I put off glasses for three years.  Jesus Christ.  I've been squinting.  Now it just hurts. 
[02:07:00]  Uh, he passed.  Yeah.  Just he passed, Jim?  Yeah.  But do you understand what he wrote there?  No, don't.  Yeah.  Let's see if he does.  P-A-S-T.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  He wrote, he passed.  Yeah, no, I didn't.  I'm sorry that a friend passed away, and I fucked up on spelling you, nerd.  No, I wish I met you back in high school.  I would have beat the fuck out of you and took your money.  This is not, you're not, this is not, this is not, this is not putting the I before you.  Just a little Norton going, you spelled that wrong.  Shut up. 
[02:07:30]  It's a basic.  Oh, right.  Just because Patrice died, that doesn't explain you being monumentally stupid.  That's not the excuse.  When he died, did he take your fucking brain with him?  It would be like, did Keith do that?  Like P-A-S-S.  No, Keith didn't do it to him.  E-D, yeah.  E-D, past.  He wrote it that's intense.  I wrote it, I wrote it on the iPhone.  The iPhone fucked up.  You can blame the iPhone.  You can blame Autocrux.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I do that sometimes, I'm like, fucking spell check.  It did fuck that, my iPhone. 
[02:08:00]  Well, here it is.  I get the call from Matt, I wrote, I turned on to make sure that he knew, and I just wrote  for him, because I didn't know if he knew, because he was on the, I don't know if he  answered his phone, I wrote that, and it just did that, and I was in bed, and what  am I going to do?  But I, I will, I, I fucked up, I apologize, Jim, for not spelling it correctly.  No, no, no, I'm very grateful it happened.  It was my one laugh in the morning.  I was like, oh, thank God, this idiot is still in self.  This is fucking mean. 
[02:08:30]  You know, in defense of Bob, he's become a way better speller.  I remember way back in the day, he called, he was sending me an email, and he called  me a faggot, and he spelt it F-A-G-I-T.  Oh, no.  Oh.  I was trying to say it, like, phonetic, or spelling it phonetically, because it was just  an accent.  Fig it.  I think Washington is talking about Washington.  Spell phonetically.  F-I-N.  Spell phonetically.  Go fuck yourself.  Do you remember that, dude, that treatment?  Remember you had me look at your treatment, and I tried to trash you about your, this is 
[02:09:00]  hilarious.  The treatment was unbelievable, the spelling, like, it was disturbing.  Right.  And I go, Bob, I go, Bobby, his spelling is crazy.  He goes, so.  So.  I didn't go to school, Kurt.  I didn't go to school.  But how about, can we just stop and focus for one second, the fact that you, insecure,  fucking lame-ass, gave Kurt your treatment to look over?  A guy you just called an open mic-er.  A guy you just called an open mic-er.  A guy you just called an open mic-er. 
[02:09:30]  And you're like, Kurt, I know it was like, you, Kurt, Kurt, Kurt, Kurt, Kurt,  Kurt is an open mic-er, but he's a writer.  He's a good writer.  Thanks, Bobby.  Kurt's a great writer.  I can spell it.  What was it?  What was it?  You can spell it.  That helps.  What was it?  It's called I'm Finish, right?  Oh, yeah, that thing.  How'd you spell that?  Yeah.  Fucking R-O-B-E-R-T-K-E-L-L-Y.  Is that the name of the pilot of things you've never said at a dinner table?  Oh, my God, man. 
[02:10:00]  That's it?  Just one?  That's it?  That's too good.  That's it?  Just one?  That's a home run.  We don't get greedy and try to pile on and bomb.  Yeah, that's true.  That's what you always get.  I always like when Voss is here, because he'll always end the fucking pun.  Oh, yeah.  He gets greedy.  First of all, there's no second of all.  We were trying to tell him last night how dumb he is, and he goes, you're dumber than  me.  I'm like, I'm not dumber than you because I know I'm dumb. 
[02:10:30]  I admit that I can't spell.  I know I'm stupid.  You think you're smart.  He said on his podcast, put the head speakers on.  He's talking about headphones.  The head speakers.  He called them head speakers.  Bonnie, put the head speakers on.  And Bonnie just went, head speakers, Rich.  Really?  Yeah.  Because he tried to blaze past it, and Bonnie goes, head speakers, are we going to go back  to that for a minute, Rich?  Are we going to talk about head speakers?  He is the dumbest fuck. 
[02:11:00]  I am fully aware that I am stupid in many areas, but I know certain things.  I don't like what Bobby's doing right now.  This is like when somebody blows the game, and before the press trashes them, they go,  you know, I take full responsibility.  Very good.  Yep.  That's exactly what he's doing.  Bobby, geez.  He's getting ahead of the story.  Well, when you're right, you're right, Bill.  Why don't you shut your face?  I hope your phone dies.  Bill, anything else on Patrice? 
[02:11:30]  Any stories?  I mean, you guys started together a long time ago, man.  Ah, God, I don't, I don't know.  No, because then I'm going to, I don't know.  I don't even want to think about it.  It's just too fucking sad.  Isn't it?  I just, um, I can't, I just, you know, I don't know that I'll be able to wrap my head around  him not being, all I can say is I'm psyched he got to do your show because your fans got  to get, get a glimpse of what it was like to hang out with him.  Because, you know, you go on there, obviously he wasn't doing his act. 
[02:12:00]  And just really seeing, like, how that guy on stage and off was just, he was just the  funniest fucking guy I ever met.  There's literally, uh, like days and days of material that could be played of him just,  just hanging out and bullshitting about everything.  Uh, people are, that, that bit you guys did, sorry to interrupt, uh, that, that bit you guys  did the up and down game with Patrice laughs like that, you know, we, you know, from his 
[02:12:30]  soul.  I thought he was going to pass.  I'm like, I used to watch that thing like five times in a row by myself and I would be  crying laughing.  Yeah.  You can't not laugh watching that.  Yeah.  The thing, he's walking out of the studio, still laughing, the door closes and you can still  hear him laughing through a soundproof door.  I remember, I couldn't wait to show Patrice what we learned.  That Bobo could do. 
[02:13:00]  Cause at that point we saw Bobo do that a bunch of times, but we knew Patrice would  bring it to a whole new fucking level.  Fucking great.  We were so excited.  Like Patrice, wait till you see what we got for you today.  And I never expected that reaction.  I knew he would enjoy it, but I never expected just that over that, that, that complete breakdown  of control.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  He was doubled, he was doubled over doing an old man shuffle out the door cause he could  not even hold himself up.  He was laughing so hard.  Yeah.  No, my favorite part is Jim never breaks character and just keeps going. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Keeps going, talking about the Mets.  I never would have been able to hold it together.  Yeah.  Repeatedly screaming, oh my God, oh my God.  That's the funniest, that's the funniest thing ever.  Watching him, you know what's great too is when you watch him shake when, when he's about  to lose it and you, and you, and you watch him, he's sitting in the chair and he's smiling  and then you just see his body losing control.  He starts to, to like shake.  Ah, shit.  For the people who don't know, Bobo, you know, he would, he would take his pants off and he 
[02:14:00]  would get hard if we talked about sex.  But as soon as we started talking about the Mets, it would instantly, instantly go soft.  It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.  And he never knew what we were doing.  He's such an idiot.  Yeah.  And so Jimmy, you know, would go back and forth and watch this thing get hard, get soft,  get hard.  Yeah, talking about her big juicy tits.  And he'd be like, yeah.  And he would put his hands together and grind his hands.  Right.  And his cock would be rock hard.  Right.  And I would go, but really, I mean, what are the Mets going to do about right field?  I mean, it's not going well.  And he would go, they got to get a draft pick.  And he would just start talking about the Mets and his dick would go soft. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  Like, like within seconds though.  Within seconds.  Have you seen the clip, Carl?  No.  Well, the clip doesn't.  I haven't seen it either.  I've got to see this.  The clip doesn't do it justice because we had to hide the whole fact.  I'd like to build up to that and start with like Louis Pasteur and his experiments.  We'll go way up to Bobo.  Bobo's magical dick.  I don't think the actual clip does it justice because we had to hide Bobo's dick for YouTube  and all that shit.  But the laugh is just contagious.  Censorship. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, no, that's one of those laughs where even if you didn't know him, you're just laughing  at how hard somebody's laughing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think I've ever seen anybody laugh that hard.  No, fucking.  And he had the greatest laugh.  So you just combine the two.  Oh my God.  Yeah, everyone in the room would be laughing just as hard as him.  Why does Opie have a fucking coat thing?  Why does he get to hang his coat and hat up and you guys don't?  Do you know what a pain in the ass it was to get that coat rack put in here? 
[02:15:30]  It was for everyone.  There's only two.  Everyone.  There's two fucking things.  Everyone.  Who's going to walk behind you and hang their jacket?  I asked for a goddamn coat rack.  You put it up right behind you.  Your stuff's up nice and neat.  These fucking scumbags have to.  Look at this.  This is all in his chair.  I'm not even wearing one.  He doesn't even have a coat because he doesn't like that.  He can't hang it.  I know it's mild.  Hey, Colin, you want to hang your jacket where Rhoda hangs hers?  Colin has a gay coat. 
[02:16:00]  Your coat really does stink.  Jesus, Joe.  It just makes Rhoda make me laugh really hard.  I like how Bob Kelly got the...  Wait, hold on one second.  Oh, fuck.  I was just lining up.  Oh, go ahead.  No, forget it now.  It's over.  It's okay, Colin.  What were you going to say?  Go ahead.  What were you going to say?  No.  The moment's passed.  No, it hasn't.  Go ahead.  Try it again.  If it bombs, so what?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, I'm not going to do it.  Just do this.  No. 
[02:16:30]  He's trying to say that.  I was going to say what I ruined.  Go ahead.  I don't like the fact that DeRosa used the alternative comedy.  Rhoda really made me laugh.  Fuck you.  You didn't say that, did you?  He said Rhoda.  Yeah, he did.  No, no.  He said it.  He said he's having a nice, honest laugh.  He goes, Rhoda really made me laugh.  Yeah, Rhoda did it for him.  Shut up, Joe.  The word roe.  He said roe.  Joe's only upset because I'm going to ruin his opening status.  Wait, wait.  What, Bill?  Bill, what'd you say?  I got my awful cell phone.  I heard Joe say that, and it fucking annoyed me. 
[02:17:00]  Fuck everybody.  Thanks.  Thanks, Bill.  Billy.  Oh.  All right, well.  Boy, I turned.  Fuck you, cunts.  God damn it.  All right, there.  Why don't we let Billy Burr go?  It's up to him.  You want to go, Bill?  He's at the airport, right?  Yeah, I got nothing left. 
[02:17:30]  All right.  The trash ain't coming my way, so why don't I hang up?  It's true.  You know it's coming.  The winds have changed.  You can tell.  I can smell it when they're coming.  See you, buddy.  See you, buddy.  All right, Bill.  Thanks, man.  See you, man.  See you, Bill.  I'll see you guys in a few days.  See you.  See you later.  Even Piers Morgan had something to say about Patrice.  Yeah.  Do you want to play this clip?  Gets it all along.  Did you hear the local clips? 
[02:18:00]  You guys would appreciate it.  I should play it for them.  Yeah.  The Fox 5 clip first.  Colin, do you hear this yet?  No.  Oh, God.  This was the only laugh I had yesterday.  It was Fox 5 here in New York.  Was it What's-His-Face?  Greg Kelly?  Huh?  Gutfeld?  No, Kelly.  Who's Greg Kelly?  Local guy.  I don't know.  Entertainment reporter for Fox 5?  No, he's just somebody else.  I mean, it's sad.  It's a 20-second obit, but listen to the end of this thing.  Sad news tonight from the entertainment world.  Comedian Patrice O'Neill has died.  O'Neill died this morning from complications from a stroke he suffered last month. 
[02:18:30]  The Boston native appeared in September's Comedy Central's roast of Charlie Sheen,  where his struggle with diabetes was a punchline for many jokes.  O'Neill was a well-known presence on talk shows in the stand-up industry  and was a frequent guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  He was 14 years old.  Oh.  14.  Come on.  Patrice was 14?  14.  I thought he was older.  Can you believe that?  That's an amazing career for a 14-year-old.  A fucking prodigy. 
[02:19:00]  Jesus.  14.  He was the Doogie Howser of comedy.  What did the rest say?  We were talking yesterday about the roast and all the jokes about diabetes,  and I was saying how, like, 18 different people tweeted that it should have been me to me,  you know, why wasn't it you?  It should be you.  I texted you that.  We were just forwarding that.  Those to you, Colin.  And then Amy Schumer said she got, like, 100 and something.  I hope you get ovarian cancer.  Holy shit.  You know what?  You should die, bitch, you know.  Dude, I wrote that roast, and it was so hard to come up with shit to make fun of Patrice 
[02:19:30]  because that's all you could get him on was he has diabetes or he looks like a gorilla.  Like, there was no...  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  But that was the only thing...  I think we just found the eulogy writer.  The next day.  But seriously, there was no, like...  Seriously?  There was no real things to make fun of him about.  It was hard to write jokes about him, so everybody wrote about that shit.  You know what I mean?  Like, nobody had...  They're still trying to be serious.  Kurt, shut up.  You called him a gorilla.  I know.  Stop.  I didn't.  You called him a gorilla. 
[02:20:00]  Amy Schumer did.  And you spoke to yourself as a horrible hack that you could only think of two subjects,  and now all the anger towards Amy is going to be focused on you for the next 10 years.  It's not going to be...  I didn't...  There was...  He was hard to hit with jokes.  He's at Muppet eyebrows on fucking Twitter.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Shut up, Joe.  Jesus, Joe.  Come on.  Kurt's not taking his shit.  I love it.  Kurt's going to beat up Joe.  Kurt's going to use those fucking huge rape hands.  Don't choke Joe's little fucking... 
[02:20:30]  Joe's got great little reaping tits.  Look at those little sweet...  I'm going to pump your...  You're going to punch me off the love seat back here.  Amy's here.  Speaking of Amy Schumer...  God damn, is she looking good.  Yeah, she does.  She looks hot in grief.  She looks hot in grief?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Guys, I've got to get out of here, actually.  I've got to go.  She'll take your seat.  I'll see you guys later.  All right, Bobby.  Thank you for coming in.  Bye, Bobby.  Take it easy, Bobby. 
[02:21:00]  Come break a lick.  Hi, Amy.  Amy.  Hey.  How are you?  Bobby warmed up the chair for you.  I'm sure it's sweaty.  Good to see you.  Hi.  Hi, honey.  Hi.  Hi, Amy.  So Kurt writes all your jokes?  Yeah.  That's what he was just saying.  That's right.  Just the ones that get me in trouble.  I go.  Amy's coat is more manly than Colin's.  I know.  It really is.  He's wearing my lovely coat today. 
[02:21:30]  Well, look at it.  You want to take a look at his coat?  P for pussy.  I think Colin's going for a distinguished.  You're like Paddington Bear.  Right here.  A distinguished gentleman's coat.  Yes.  That's what he's going for.  What do you think?  Yeah.  He's definitely hitting the nail on the head there.  Sure with a nice collar buckle.  Yeah.  It does.  It has a collar buckle.  It's a handy ball gag buckle.  No longer a man. 
[02:22:00]  You guys really should switch coats before we're done here today.  Yeah.  Why are you holding your coat?  Because everyone asked me to show it to Amy.  I was just displaying it.  I was doing what I was doing.  Colin, you want me to hang up the coat?  You think someone's going to steal it?  I was wondering why in the middle of this, like, trashing, you weren't just sitting there  scowling at me.  I was like, what's his fucking problem, man?  He was waiting his turn.  He was revving up.  But you know what Billy was saying about Patrice?  Yeah.  I was thinking, that just reminded me, when we started doing the show, and before we did  Tough Crowd, we did it on NBC a couple of times. 
[02:22:30]  And I remember, I was always like, oh, don't leave him alone.  You know, he was so new to the business.  It was like the only thing he'd ever had.  And I knew, don't leave him alone with any of these fucking NBC executives.  Oh, shit, yeah.  And then I remember one time, just walking in, and it was like a soundproof office.  Like, every time I left him alone with Lorne, anybody, something horrible would happen.  But just a soundproof office, and it was like some guy from the West Coast was in town.  And it was just him and the guy on the West Coast.  And he was sitting there, and I looked over at the guy, and he had this horrified look 
[02:23:00]  on his face.  And Patrice was talking as if, yeah, there were a couple of guys having a conversation.  And I just walked in, and I heard, like, pussy and bitches.  Like, he was just, like, spouting to this, like, white guy in his 50s in a fucking suit.  But it was just like, as if he was having a conversation with fucking, you know, Will at  the cellar.  And it was just like, and the guy just had this horrified, like, his face was pacey white.  He gave no respect.  No, no.  That's what he would do, though. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  That's a pretty accurate description.  He gave him no respect.  That's right, yeah.  I had to do another big producer once.  I remember at the cellar, this guy was doing, like, a movie, and it was like, hey, Patrice,  I thought, I still had, I still said there had to be a slight scintilla of non-destructiveness.  Patrice, this guy's doing it.  And the guy goes, hi, I heard a lot about you.  Patrice is at the bar at the cellar, and he turns around like fucking royalty, like this.  And then just turns away.  A little dainty handshake. 
[02:24:00]  Jesus Christ.  He drove me out to one of Ant's barbecues one time.  He's like, I'll pick you up.  And I was so touched that he was giving me a ride that I spent two hours making him these rap CDs.  I made them like three.  Did you talk in between songs, too?  Personal story before every song. 
[02:24:30]  Wow.  I made up three rap CDs.  I was like, these are songs he probably doesn't have.  Now, Jerry, I imagine the band striking up the music.  Oh, what a show.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Mom!  Trying to do this now!  What were some of the songs on there?  It was all rap songs.  Give me a couple.  They were all like...  I need love by Cool J.  Yeah, I need love by Cool J.  Doing it.  Yeah, doing it well.  Hey, love. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  You can do it.  Some voice demand.  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.  No, I was like, dude, I appreciate you giving me a ride, man.  I know you're not going to take gas money.  I thought you might enjoy these for when you're driving around.  He really took gas money.  Yeah.  He goes, all right, like that rap.  Because you just came out of the closet to him.  That's a long ride.  He put every CD, I swear to God, every CD he put in back-to-back and he just sat there. 
[02:25:30]  Two seconds of each song and he goes...  Oh, shit.  Next.  Literally, through each CD, he goes, I mean, Joe, goddamn, I mean...  You didn't appreciate the...  I appreciate the gesture and all, I guess, but...  You didn't recognize that you're a white rap historian?  Wow.  Yeah, I think there were...  This is twin hype, Patrice, in the 90s.  I think there was...  He called me Cracker a few times in between songs.  But the funny is that when he found out I was Egyptian, he'd call me up, like, on Thanksgiving. 
[02:26:00]  He'd be like, Joe, you want to come over for Thanksgiving?  I can't.  I'm doing stuff with my family.  He goes, you know what, Joe?  I'm tired of you pretending you're white.  And he'd go, everybody knows you're a dirty nigga African.  Just like the rest of us.  I remember when I sent Patrice a text that I was having a kid.  He just calls up.  I see him call him. 
[02:26:30]  I think he's going to graduate.  He's like, the first thing he says, please tell me the bitch is white.  That's what he said.  Oh, shit.  I'll never forget, I was at the comic strip Christmas party.  And I brought this girl in.  She was really hot.  And Patrice is just looking her up and down.  He goes, you got this in the bag?  I go, yeah.  He goes, so I could say whatever I want?  And I go, yeah, because you sure?  I don't want to ruin it for you.  Why would you say yeah?  Why would you say yeah?  I was like, no, it's fine.  So I just went over.  He goes, you like this guy?  And she's like, yeah, he's really funny.  He's like, do you know his opening joke is the difference between alcohol and marijuana? 
[02:27:00]  You realize that?  She's like, yeah, he's really funny.  Yeah, I know that one.  That's good.  You realize he does voices of puppets on TV.  That's like my favorite show.  And he goes, you're just a dumb bitch.  And the girl's like, how can you say he's your friend?  I'm like, he's joking.  She's like, how is that a joke?  He just called me a dumb bitch.  Holy fuck.  He ended a couple of my relationships early. 
[02:27:30]  He did, yeah.  You know, you'd see him get that look in his eye, like, and you didn't know what mood Patrice  is going to be in.  He could be the most lovely, like, little angel, or just, he would just slowly turn.  It was like slow-mo, and I saw him sizing up the dude I was with, and I'm like, no, running  over.  It was too late.  Too late.  Just trash this guy's life.  The guy, I don't think he ever got an erection again.  I went to a dinner party one time. 
[02:28:00]  We used to have the same manager, and they invited us to this dinner party.  I showed up with a date, second date with the girl, and I was trying so hard to impress  her.  I walk in with her.  Patrice goes, hey, what's up, Joe?  Who's this?  And I go, it's Melissa.  And he goes, hey, Melissa, did you fuck him yet?  Did you fuck Joe yet?  And she goes, no.  And he goes, you should fuck him.  He's a good dude.  Fuck this dude.  I'm like, all right.  Let's have hors d'oeuvres now. 
[02:28:30]  Obviously, Amy Schumer is here, and now Louis C.K. has entered the studio.  Hey, Louis.  Morning, guys.  Hey, Louis.  How you doing, man?  It's like everybody that Twittered yesterday.  I didn't tweet.  You didn't tweet?  I always feel phony.  Phony?  Really?  Well, the thing in my heart goes at it.  Well, yeah.  It depends on it.  Well, if you word it like Colin, then it comes off.  Insensitive and hacked.  Put on Colin's coat and say it.  No, it's not that it's phony at all.  It's just that, to me, you know. 
[02:29:00]  It's just not your thing.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I never tweet about anything, and so.  And all of a sudden you're going to tweet about something like that?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know why I don't do it.  Because I don't love anybody that much.  I don't care.  Wait till you see Colin's coat.  I made a witty remark.  Wait till you see Colin's coat.  Oh, boy.  He's defending it.  At the beginning of my witticism, I happened to throw in Patrice's one of a kind.  So, you know, people kind of let it slide.  One of a kind.  Right.  So then Bill Barker just calls on the phone from the airport.  And goes, yeah, I don't want to leave any tweet like some one of a kind, some hack 
[02:29:30]  fucking quote.  And I thought at first he saw my quote and was busting my balls, but he was just saying  it was really worse.  Even worse.  He really meant it not knowing what you wrote.  How about the fact that he didn't know what you even wrote?  No.  Yeah.  No idea.  That's insensitive.  And he didn't bother to investigate the full thing that I wrote.  That's what hurt the most.  True.  He just picked out the one hack one, you know, for showing your age part.  I told my kids this morning about Patrice and, you know, and I listened to, because 
[02:30:00]  I told, I told them I'm going here afterwards and then all his friends are going to be  here and, and so I turned it on and there's fucking, is he here still, Bobby?  Did he leave?  Oh, Bobby.  Yeah.  Just left.  Yeah.  I turned it on and Bobby's, he's not even saying anything.  He's just, and the fucking, we're all at the fucking cellar last night.  And we're fucking, he's just telling a story.  He could be saying anything.  He's like, we're all at the fucking cellar and fucking, what's his name is there?  And fucking, he's not upset. 
[02:30:30]  He's not, it's just this shit that comes out of his fucking mouth.  I think he just caught a popcorn in his mouth.  And my daughters are six and nine and I'm going, I'm trying to ride the fucking volume.  Ride the volume.  And they can't enjoy people's emotions about their fucking past friend because of this.  Fucking, and so they go like, why does he, they had to ask, like, why does this person,  because it sounds crazy.  Yeah, of course.  If you don't listen to it all the time, it's like, what's wrong with this?  It's beyond Tourette's. 
[02:31:00]  It's like.  That's so odd because here, when he was here talking into the mic, you don't realize it  because he's here.  He says fuck a lot.  Bobby likes fuck.  But I guess if you're listening to it on the radio, you really, especially with children.  Right.  But I explained to them that Patrice and Bobby and I came from Boston.  And that there was, I told them what it's like to do comedy there, that there's drunk  Irish people.  I'm getting them, I'm getting them, I'm teaching them stereotypes.  Irish Bostonians get wasted and they just, and they sing na, na, na, na, hey, hey, you 
[02:31:30]  got chanted off stage.  And so people had different ways to survive that.  And Bobby's whiskey, I explained to the kids the difference between, like, you're trying  to tell a story.  So I went to the store and the guy there was really, uh, mean to me.  Nobody's listening.  They're throwing stuff at you.  I went to the fucking store and the fucking guy was a fucking asshole.  Like it's a way of charging through the shit.  Like that's what turns guys like that. 
[02:32:00]  Oh shit.  And then Patrice was just this enormous, a mountain that sat on stage.  He was just a mountain.  A whole other approach to being listened to by those audiences.  Yeah.  Bostonians terrified of giant black men.  Yeah.  Just a huge, uh, presence.  Uh, yeah.  Did you start out with him on the stage?  No, he came, uh, up after I'd left Boston and then he just showed up here as this Boston,  young, enormous Boston guy.  Bigger than life.  He's just, yeah, he didn't have to move around on stage or anything. 
[02:32:30]  He was so, last time I saw him on stage, we did a, uh, the nasty show in Chicago at the  Vic theater and it was me and him and Nick DiPaolo.  Were you on that show?  I don't remember if you were there.  What year was it?  Uh, I did that with Geraldo and Patrice a year and a half ago.  I don't know if I was on that one.  But he closed the show.  I hosted it and he went on last and he was, I mean, it's just, he would just stand there  and fucking, he was, he was really starting to hit a stride too.  He was getting great.  I mean, he's always been one of my favorite comedians, like always in like the top three 
[02:33:00]  since I first saw him.  Wow.  But in the last few years, he just started to get great.  Like he figured it, every comedian hits some point where they figure out their thing.  Mm-hmm.  Like they do the Hellraiser box, they click it right and it starts fucking, everybody starts  coming out of the doors and hitting everybody.  And he just didn't hit that.  I mean, just that last special was incredible.  He was just starting to figure out how to make his thing really work.  Yeah.  And, and offstage, to be able to do that on stage is fantastic. 
[02:33:30]  But then offstage, just to hang out and bullshit about stuff and make it genuinely funny.  Any fucking subject that would come up in here when he was sitting here, he had, he had  something on it.  He had at least a half hour on it.  No, he, I was telling, I was trying to explain him to my kids.  Cause I, I want them to understand what this stuff means.  Besides that he was a big black guy and he said crazy shit.  Um, I had to like, I'm explaining him.  I had to say that he was black at some point.  Like it didn't matter, but at some point I had to say he was a huge black guy. 
[02:34:00]  Like I didn't, it didn't actually wasn't material to anything I had to say about him.  Right, but you do, you feel compelled to describe him like that.  And also the life lesson that you got to fucking take care of yourself.  But, uh, you know, which is, uh, makes me angry at him.  But, uh, it's just, that's the, you know, biggest substance abuse problem amongst black  people is cherry Coke.  But I told them, I thought of a bit that they, he did here that I was able to explain 
[02:34:30]  to them and for a six and a nine year old to grasp, it was kind of weird, but they got  it cause of his wording, which was, um, about Plaxico or whatever the guy's name was, who  shot himself.  Yeah.  The thing that he said about how his, you know, he was rich now living in a mansion and  he had a choice in life.  He could live, hang out with rich white guys and play golf or hang out with black guys  that he grew up with.  But if he won't, who are fun, but in order to do that, he had to carry a gun cause those 
[02:35:00]  guys are fucking stupid.  So it was like, live amongst your own, but he's not stupid.  He's rich now.  So he had to carry a weapon in order to hang out with his own people.  That's such an acute observation.  That's where he would find these like cracks in the, the little things that no one else was  thinking about.  And my kids were howling.  They, they got why that was funny.  Wow.  There was shit that like I pondered for years.  And when the subject came up, I felt all good about being able to discuss it and talk 
[02:35:30]  about it.  And then I was saying before in one sentence, he'd wrap it up and be like, how did I never  see that?  And he'd close the book on it.  Yeah.  Done.  Here's what it is.  Yeah.  And that's it.  And that's where everyone now has to refer to Patrice versus the people.  Yes.  He said, Patrice versus the people for racial harmony.  No, and he, I mean, I remember he, like the, the famous thing of him going on, whatever 
[02:36:00]  it was on Fox news.  Yeah.  We just played that.  Yeah.  He gets, there's this, a woman who actually dresses up to go and protest a rape joke and  he makes her laugh at a rape joke.  She laughed at it.  She absolutely did.  That's the power of what he did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He couldn't, she, even, she couldn't deny this woman whose whole, I, whole life is, I'm  going to go act outraged.  Right.  Yeah.  And she had to go, shit.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  I wonder what she's doing now.  That could have been good when she went back to the office. 
[02:36:30]  Changed her path.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would really like to know what's happening when comedy hall rape jokes.  He was a guy who forced people.  He also didn't take any easy roads himself.  Like everybody does some bullshit version of themselves.  Everybody does.  I do.  I have like a bunch of jokes that I know are just there.  Cause I, old fat, oh, you know, overweight, middle aged dad.  Like I got a bunch of those that I'm going to, ace in the hole.  Yeah, exactly.  But he has, I was going to say he forced you to be honest, man.  Yeah.  And he, he didn't do that himself. 
[02:37:00]  Like he was such an atypical, the first thing he ever did that made, that I saw that made  me go, this guy is special was, uh, his bit about how he loves the Beatles and the pressure  as a black guy to have certain trappings.  And he says, I love the Beatles, but I can't.  And he do it.  You know, this visual of him riding around in a Cadillac.  Like, we all live in a yellow submarine, like in the hood.  What's up, Jeep?  Yellow submarine.  Yellow submarine.  But, uh, that's not your typical, uh, big black guy bit. 
[02:37:30]  No, no.  We, we, we got into so many great, uh, racial, uh, conversations on this show.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, you know, he, he, he just slammed me and, uh, but the great thing was the second  the show ended, you know, we'd be walking down the sidewalk going to the parking garage  and he's just, you know, Hey, how's, how's your pool?  What's that like?  What's that like, your pool and shit?  That, that cool?  No, my favorite part of being on this show.  It's like, that's so fucking cool.  I loved being on when he was on, cause he'd get, like, we could, we would lock horns on 
[02:38:00]  stuff and get, like, I, I told him once I wasn't attracted sexually to black women.  And he tested me for like two hours saying, saying that, that meant I'm gay.  And he said, so he would go like, and he, it was, he'd start,  he started doing this bit where he'd be like, please bring up, like, and it was like a lawyer  asking for, he was like, uh, uh, please bring up fatbooty.com.  Like, you know, he's like, really nothing?  There's nothing that you can, you know what, bring up. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Look at that, that's juicy.  Pissing on blacktits.net.  And he'd come up and he'd go, this, you don't like this.  He had references, man.  But we would go at it here.  And then, yeah, we'd walk, I, the best part though, was walking down to the subway with  him.  And then we'd stand on like 6th Avenue and, and 7th, or 57th and just stand there for  like four hours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he'd say openly sexual things to every woman that walked by and they would all smile. 
[02:39:00]  You look delicious.  Yeah.  He's just like, look at you with those pants.  What kind of panties you got on?  Pink.  Bye.  Good morning.  He would vote for it on a street corner.  Yeah.  When we would do the, when we would do the walkover at the old station.  Right.  And we'd be walking to XM and Patrice would just stop and talk to any girl that was walking  and they would engage him.  Yes.  They would talk to him.  No, like he wouldn't do it.  And it's like, why aren't they running?  He would disarm you because he was funny and silly and he wasn't threatening. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  And they would just like, look at him.  But on the, you would think he would be threatening you.  Right.  Right.  I mean, just his physical presence would be threatening and the ability.  Maybe that's what it was.  It was the relief.  It's like, oh no, here's, here's the black guy.  But he's got kind of a sweet voice.  Oh, I want to hug him now.  We were at the comic strip one time and there was a girl he liked at a Christmas party.  And he's like trying to play hard to get.  He's like, I'm not going to talk to her.  And he didn't talk to her and she didn't come over.  And I said, you fucking idiot.  You think that you're being like hard to get.  She's happy.  You're not talking to her.  She doesn't like you. 
[02:40:00]  He really thought that she was being intrigued by his evasiveness.  He was just happy that this fucking fat creep was leaving her alone.  The ability to diffuse his physical presence with something so fast, like that quickly  when he started talking to you, is amazing.  Because you would just look and go, ah, big black man, must be afraid, must cross street.  He was an empathetic person too.  I mean, that's what made him a great comic is that he saw, you know, he had insight 
[02:40:30]  because he was empathetic.  But he was a guy who would, like, talk to him for five minutes, he'd start asking you  about your life and what's going on with this and that.  Every single time.  Hey, you like your truck?  Yeah.  Be talking about my truck and stuff.  Yeah, I got mine.  I like it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, really?  Where is this conversation going?  You knew it wasn't a conversation.  He was basically fishing for information.  And when he was done, he was just going to walk away or get off the phone.  It wasn't like, I really want to know about your truck. 
[02:41:00]  It was like, I need a piece of this and a piece of that.  And then I'm done with you.  That's right.  That's right.  I'm going to put on my bowler hat.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mr. Cotton Club.  A lot of looks.  Oh, fuck.  Remember he pulled off the Pink Panther pink shirt?  How we didn't rip him apart for that?  We tried, too, man.  Yeah, he was wearing a Pink Panther pink shirt with a Pink Panther on there.  What the fuck?  Only he could get away with that.  Holy fuck.  Walking in here with that shit on.  It had the Pink Panther on it? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It had, what, sequins on it to it?  Oh, it was sequins and glitter.  Holy fuck.  Oh, what the fuck?  He was trying to pull off with that one.  We tried.  We didn't get the best of them that day.  Dude, one of the funniest days in here ever was, he was in here, and we started talking  about food from around the country, and he started trashing every city's food, and he's  going, he's going, Chicago deep dish pizza stinks. 
[02:42:00]  It fucking stinks.  And the phones are just fucking lighting up.  The whole world is hating on him.  Yeah, Texas barbecue.  Oh, we got the best barbecue.  Fuck yeah, barbecue.  Fuck.  You took them all on, though, man.  Oh, my God.  It was hilarious.  Fuck yeah.  So many good fucking...  But it's like I was saying, like, every subject we came up with had a twist.  One of the funniest things was when we were talking about the cruise ship deaths, and how 
[02:42:30]  it's just so easy to kill your significant other on a cruise ship.  They circle around three times, and then leave the scene of the crime.  You just got to push them overboard.  No evidence.  In a giant ocean, and he, like, took it the extra step to do the Rasta man selling rock  coats to your significant other.  Buy a rock coat man!  And you put it on, and then push your loved one over the edge, and they just sink right  to the bottom.  Fucking hilarious. 
[02:43:00]  They even did that to Bin Laden.  That's even how they got rid of him.  Yeah, get rid of him.  You're never going to find him.  It's the ocean.  The ocean.  Yeah.  But people were bringing up so many things, and there's just, like I said, literally,  if you strung them back-to-back days worth of shit, that is just material that isn't  stuff on stage.  It's, you know, it's just conversation.  Most of the stuff he didn't even do in his act.  No.  It's just him talking.  Well, that's the beauty of it.  I mean, not to kiss your asses, but that's the beauty of you guys.  Most of the stuff you do on our show, you don't do on stage. 
[02:43:30]  Kurt only does material in here.  Yeah.  That's all he does.  I only talk about Joe's fucking little fat tits on my back.  And I see no reason to change it.  Just get them on the radio.  That's the name of your new album.  Joe's little fat tits.  Right?  That was from my...  Be quiet.  Louie's kid's a listener.  Explain to your kids why they can spell better than Bobby.  Damn!  Yeah, I love how he heard that.  He called you a nerd because of how he spelled past. 
[02:44:00]  Past.  Yeah.  P-A-S-T.  You're a nerd.  Like, you only Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking and Jim Norton know how to spell fucking past.  Yes, yes, he did.  He passed.  That's like the caveman talking.  He passed.  He passed.  Meet the future.  It's like a weird...  It's like an E.E. Cummings poem about a dead guy.  He passed.  Fucking moron.  Yeah, you nerd.  Sorry for paying attention at school.  He tries to turn it around on Jim like, oh, you're one of those guys. 
[02:44:30]  It's like there was a basic spelling error that everybody makes in a long and complicated word.  This is not a P-H in the middle of a word, you asshole.  Five-year-olds can spell this right.  It's not even like laugh with a G-H.  There's no silent letters.  I get the same one.  Idiot.  He spells yeah.  He spells yeah Y-A.  So he'll text you.  I got the same one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did it happen?  Oh, you got the same thing to you?  Yeah, sure.  Moron. 
[02:45:00]  And it's not a spell check thing.  No.  He blames it all the time.  Go over to the T.  It's a whole other part of the...  Yes.  It's geographically very far.  From two S's and an E.D.  You can definitely tell if somebody fucked up or if the iPhone fucked up.  You know what?  You're right.  And I wish I would have called him on that.  It annoyed me when he said spell check.  It's like there's more letters than the other one.  We all know.  Also, when somebody's defending themselves and they use two different defenses, the first one  was, well, who knows how to spell pass? 
[02:45:30]  That's like a Latin verb.  That's where he starts.  And then he goes, oh, well, it was the spell check.  Of course I know.  I'm a nerd too, Jim.  It was the spell check.  He also said that he was laying in bed.  Sorry.  I was laying in bed.  He was like, what are you going to do?  Yeah, you can't spell when you're laying in bed.  Oh, no.  When you're laying in bed, there's no way.  Then you're at the mercy of that aggressive spell check.  We should call him right now.  Very proactive.  He's on the set.  Don't bother him.  Oh, that's right.  He's on the set.  He's on the set. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, this is stupid.  Goddamn, man.  We should call Tribeca Films and tell him you have a guy on your cast that can't spell.  Get him fired.  So.  I'm smart, too, dude.  So.  I'm smart, too.  I'm not dumb like everyone thinks.  Dude.  You know what, dude?  Passed over, dude.  I'm finished.  You know what, dude?  You're so shmarmy.  You're spelling the words right. 
[02:46:30]  What are you, queer?  Spelling.  That's his thing is the fat consonants.  Yeah.  It's just a...  Spelling.  Spell so.  Dude.  Dude.  He just spits out his consonants.  Oh, man.  Spell.  Just because you could spell.  He totally dissected his speech.  That's fantastic.  Spelling.  Dude.  Dude.  Fucking.  Fucking.  I got a fucking pencil and I wrote fucking. 
[02:47:00]  What are you doing?  What are you emphasizing?  What feeling are you emphasizing?  Oh, fuck, man.  The visual of you turning down the radio for your daughters is killing me.  Well, dude, I always want to listen to this show, but I drive my daughters to school and  I'm always riding the volume.  But with him, it was just...  And sometimes I let it go.  Yeah.  It's curses in the world.  I don't...  And I do it for a living.  So I don't mind my girls know it earlier than a lot of kids their age.  But that was, you know, Jesus.  There's no call for that.  Yeah.  It just doesn't make sense. 
[02:47:30]  It's not even that it's, like, offensive.  It just makes no sense.  Right.  Fucking.  Because even when he confused Colin with Bill Barr, he's like, cocksucker.  He couldn't just say Bill.  It was Colin.  He's like, fucking cocksucker.  That's how he spells the name Bill.  If you had the iPhone.  That's what he does.  Because he's so insecure, he doesn't think he exists if he's not making a big explosive  noise.  He can't just go anyway, so here's how I feel. 
[02:48:00]  Because he feels like he's shrinks to nothing.  Oh, poor Bobby.  So he's got to talk like this and say, fucking.  In order to, like, feel like he's registering us, feel like he's moving the needle on life  at all.  Otherwise, he's going to kill himself.  Well, that poor bastard.  Quiet is terrifying, man.  I wish he was still here.  No, and I explain to my kids how, like, in New York, the audiences are harder in a whole  other way.  In Boston, it's like, you're going to get your ass kicked and people are going to scream.  But here, they're just deathly, intelligently quiet. 
[02:48:30]  It's unnerving when you come from Boston.  And so when a guy like him comes, and I described a guy like Bobby sputtering and cursing on stage,  and New Yorker's just cringing, going, what's this guy doing?  And his face is turning red.  His fucking now bald face is turning red.  And he's trying to spin it on the mic.  Any kind of literacy is going to upset Bobby.  He also pauses to fucking and cursing as a way of pausing, because he's too stupid to  collect a lot of thoughts in a row. 
[02:49:00]  He picks them up piecemeal as he's going.  And you know what, dude?  Fucking.  And as he's doing that, he's like thinking, like, next, please, next, please, next.  Something come into my brain.  He can't be, he can't put silence between words.  Oh, my God.  Instead of going, so then.  And that's, again, perfect, exact opposite of Patrice, who could command.  And then he'd talk, and then it'd be quiet, and you'd wait for him.  Yeah, yeah.  But Bobby's like, yeah, so then I fucking, I went to the van, this fucking cock sucking. 
[02:49:30]  These are all him trying to think of what comes next.  It's the equivalent.  Those are supposed to be pauses.  It's the equivalent of dot, dot, dot.  Yeah.  On paper.  Dude, no silence between words and no air between bites.  No.  God damn.  Thanks for the laugh.  Bobby's policy.  No.  Patrice was not afraid of that silence, too.  Yeah.  No, that's what was so.  That's a talent.  He was just quiet.  Yeah.  No, and then he had a fastball.  Like, he could do that, and then when he'd get on a roll about something. 
[02:50:00]  I mean, he was a very, I love, one thing I love about stand-up since I started loving  it is how it works, like, musically, you know?  How somebody works the mic and sounds.  Like a rhythm?  Yeah.  And he had this great way of doing that, that he would start by just talking about something,  introducing the subject, make people even a little unnerved by how uninterested he is  in fucking standing there and doing a big performance.  And then he would start getting excited about something, and then he'd start, and then 
[02:50:30]  his voice would go up to that raspy register, and he'd start feeling it, and then the place  is rolling, and he'd rock.  You know, it was just incredible to watch.  Yeah, it had a great dynamic to the whole thing.  That's a confidence.  That's what he was starting to figure out.  Because he was on stage.  He was funnier in here than he was on stage for a long time.  And he was just, I think, just, it takes until you're in your late 30s, 40s to suddenly  turn into, I can fucking do anything I want up here.  I think that he just got there.  There was probably a fear of starting slow. 
[02:51:00]  Like, starting with a basic conversation, and not this, you know, I gotta grab their attention,  I gotta talk fast, I gotta talk loud.  Like, just, like you said, this almost disinterested way he would introduce the subject, and then  it would build, but to have the confidence to do that at first, and not think you're  gonna lose the crowd, right?  What gets you finally to do it is when you get older, you just don't care.  You really just don't give a shit.  You actually don't mind if your life sticks up. 
[02:51:30]  Fuck it.  I disagree, you need a good icebreaker.  Shecky Quinn over there.  You gotta have an icebreaker.  You gotta have a good start-up.  I went to the taping, and I don't know if it made the DVD, but just like what you're  saying, he came out and just checked out the room for like five minutes, and I'm sitting  there.  That takes a huge amount of balls.  And I'm sitting there in the audience.  I don't know.  I don't have those balls.  I don't know if they edited that out of the DVD.  I haven't seen it yet.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm sitting in my seat like, this is your fucking chance. 
[02:52:00]  Do something.  But he had the confidence to just take it all in.  Well, you get the crowd into your gear when you do that.  Yeah, yeah.  There was one guy who was great at that, but I don't know, I think he's long gone, but remember  Jonathan Solomon?  Ray J. Johnson.  Jonathan Solomon used to come on stage, and the first time I saw him, he had a tape recorder  with him.  And he came on stage, didn't say anything.  He just came on stage, and he looked at the tape recorder to make sure it was running.  And then he put it on the thing, and then kind of cleared his throat, looked around the  room, and then started.  And I was like, bleh. 
[02:52:30]  But he did that every night.  After I saw him a few times, he always starts by pretending he's not sure of his recorder.  Like, I don't even need to look at you people yet.  And it would be like, at first you'd go, what a dick.  But then you'd go, I guess this is what he does.  As soon as he gets one laugh, he's bought credibility for that pace.  It is almost like rebooting the crowd, you know?  You kind of, here's my pace.  It doesn't matter how high energy he was.  Right, fuck him.  John Joseph just did three songs. 
[02:53:00]  And now you're all going to watch me fiddle with my Panasonic micro-record.  I was going to say, another guy that used to do that, and I'm waiting for my trashing.  But Ray Romano would go on at the end of a show, and he'd go on and be like, the whole  crowd's like, oh, this fucking asshole talking about his fucking family.  And by the end of that set, they'd be like, yeah.  Yeah, they'd fucking get him right into his energy.  You've got to bring him into your wheelhouse, Kyle.  Into your wheelhouse.  That's a good word, Jim. 
[02:53:30]  We have Bob Kelly on the phone.  Oh, shit.  Bobby, Bobby, we were just talking about you.  Hey, guys, I know.  I hate everyone in that.  And fuck you, Louie.  You've been jerking off to this the whole time.  You love being talked about.  You stanky, red-headed fucking piece of shit.  There it goes with the fucking again.  Why would it hurt my feelings if my hair is red?  It's been that my whole life.  Exactly.  It's the only thing you can come up with. 
[02:54:00]  You don't even have, like, a unique...  Yeah.  I didn't say anything about how you look or just your basic...  You said it's bald-faced.  Hardware?  You did say it's bald-faced.  Well, after, like, a long, other acute...  ...and you say you don't like me.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  I don't say I don't like you.  Yeah, fuck you.  Fuck you, Louie.  I don't say I don't like you.  That's what you heard.  Fuck you, Louie, with your two legs and your goddamn toes.  Fuck you.  And I hope you should listen.  Fuck them, too.  Okay.  Oh, man. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, Bobby.  I brought him into the conversation.  And he just hung up on that one.  He said, I hope your kids are listening.  Fuck them.  That's right.  I know you're listening, too, now, you idiot.  Right now, what he's doing...  Right now, he's walking away, putting his phone, and he's trying to pull up his pants  like a fat man's eye when he walks.  You have no way.  He's a little crawly.  He's trying to pull his pants up the bottom half of the egg of his body. 
[02:55:00]  And they got nowhere to hang.  There's no friction there.  No, there's nowhere to hook onto.  Yeah.  He's just got to pull them so tight that there's a belt marked up in his fucking non-waist.  He probably wrote out that rant just so...  Because we're just making fun of how he talks.  He probably was reading it from a piece of paper.  That's all he has.  And that's why he hung up.  Yeah, nothing else.  And he spelled red hair H-A-R-E. 
[02:55:30]  Want to take a quick break?  Yeah, yeah.  I got pissed badly.  Just for live read purposes.  But yeah.  Louis C.K., we got Colin Quinn, Jim Florentine, Kurt Metzger, Joe DeRosa, and David Telda showed up.  Okay, where's Amy?  Where did Amy go?  She left, I think.  Amy left.  Why'd she leave?  What?  She got pissed off.  What?  She told me you guys have the shit out of her.  She had something to do?  Yeah.  What'd she have to do?  I don't know what she had to do.  She had anything to do.  None of your fucking business.  She's lying.  She might have to do another radio interview here.  I think that's where she went.  Oh. 
[02:56:00]  All right.  She'll probably come back.  She'll probably do a woman's station.  I hope so.  The woman's network.  Talk about their vaginas and periods.  Quick break and we'll continue.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Got a lot of guys in the studio.  Oh my God, it's so funny.  Jim Norton.  Everyone's hilarious.  Jim Quarantine.  Louis C.K.  Colin has left.  David Telda has come in.  Joe DeRosa. 
[02:56:30]  We're back on the air.  Ed Sker.  Russ Manee.  We haven't seen Russ in a while.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, guys.  I just want to say, as a representative of the white comedy community, I'm glad to be here.  It's hard to be a loss.  And I think now we have every race and creed represented.  That's right.  It's good.  We're all...  It is funny.  This is Patrice's home.  There's not one black guy in here.  No, no.  Where was Keith?  I thought he was...  The one black guy.  Keith.  I don't know.  Keith is...  I saw Keith last night, but he knows today or tomorrow it's an open invite to come in. 
[02:57:00]  Or Kevin Hart, I don't think, is in New York right now.  Yeah, we'll take some more people tomorrow.  And that about covers it.  Yeah.  That's it.  And then there's...  I'm there, motherfucker.  That's it.  Yeah.  I think it's great that you guys are doing this.  And it's a shock.  And I don't know about anybody in this room, but because of Twitter and all that kind of  stuff, I can't even process exactly what's happening or what happened.  And it's just a horrible loss.  So, yeah.  It really is.  And you see it on Twitter and you'd see how many people love the guy. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, but how many went paid to see him, huh?  Yeah, that's true.  I hate to be the douche and bag of the conversation here, but yeah.  Yeah, everybody loves him for free.  We've got a purple suit to buy and a gigantic coffin, all right?  Let's make things happen.  Oh, my God.  All right?  Jesus Christ.  Enough hemming and hawing about it.  Oh, my God.  The bells.  Oh, my God. 
[02:58:00]  Nine, nine, nine.  What?  Oh, sorry.  That was the last time I was here.  No, but I mean, honestly, it's true.  There's a lot of fans and...  Oh, my God.  What?  Well, what were you guys talking about before I got here?  No, Patrice, we didn't bring it up.  You're the first one to bring it up.  Yeah.  Oh, the president's in town.  You're right.  There's so many other things happening.  We're going to talk about that.  Holy God.  Purple suit and a giant coffin.  Purple suit and a giant coffin.  First of all, Patrice was probably the most fucking hardcore, could not give a shit about 
[02:58:30]  what anybody thought.  And that starts from the, whatchamacallit, show business itself.  He could not...  I've never seen a guy walk away from more projects.  Oh, God.  The Office, he was on that, right?  Yeah.  He was like, fuck, I'm out of here.  This is like, no, I don't want to do this.  Arrested Development?  Arrested Development.  Web Junk?  Web Junk.  And I'm sure several movies where they just probably wanted... 
[02:59:00]  Russ worked with him on the last pilot for Comedy Central, right?  Yeah, that's right.  Russ McNeil, everybody.  Yeah, and you know, the way you're saying that, we were involved in something with his  pilot, and it wasn't going the way he wanted it to go.  And there was a room full of Comedy Central executives, and I'm telling you, he screamed  with not even a hiccup of anxiety or attention, for 20 minutes.  Just a steady stream of well-thought-out insults, and just let everybody out with no fear of losing  it.  He was really willing to walk away all the time. 
[02:59:30]  Ultimate balls.  Yeah, totally.  Ultimate balls.  From the beginning, from his whole life.  Jim, you tweeted a picture yesterday.  You and Patrice on a movie set, and how miserable he was, or something like that.  Furry Vengeance.  Did he do something on there?  We fucking did...  Furry Vengeance, which is not a great film.  We played construction workers, and we had this...  They gave us honey wagons.  I saw you guys do construction hats.  I just saw us laughing.  Ah, Furry Vengeance, we played construction workers.  I was like the codependent wife.  He was just embarrassing to be associated with, because we had to go in and do our first 
[03:00:00]  meet with the director, and we had sat around all day.  And I'm trying to like, hey, we're doing a movie, and it's a Brooke Shields movie, and  we're sitting down.  And he's just...  You're like the battered wife making excuses.  I'm like, you know what?  He's tired.  The wife of the alcoholic.  Everybody hated him on that shoot.  He was so...  He never had a time, like when you first come to New York and start being in show biz or  whatever, everybody has some awful, cringeworthy memory of, you know, meeting a booker or whoever 
[03:00:30]  and shooting up too quickly from your chair.  Oh, hi, hi, thank you.  Yes, thank you.  He never lived that moment in his whole life.  He could be slumped in a chair, and, you know, Steven Spielberg walks up to him, and  he looks at him like, do I have to take my hand out of my pocket to shake your hand?  How you doing?  Uppity.  I think it's the one he's looking for.  He's uppity.  He's uppity.  But a good kind of uppity. 
[03:01:00]  He was a very down energy uppity.  But I can say this, because I talked to, and I think a lot of the comics here will back  me up.  But there's a lot of comics who wishes they could be here, and you've been getting calls  from people.  To this young generation of comedy, like, Louie and I are kind of like, you know, in gym,  like, we're all the gyms here.  There's like nine gyms.  We're different.  But to, like, Russ's people, and Joe especially, like, Joe's people, Joe Jarosz's people, Patrice  was the guy that they looked up to, because he was definitely the fucking wildest, like, 
[03:01:30]  you know, commander of, like, a stage.  And, like, especially with the New York City club scene, which is way better than, you know,  like, the L.A. club scene in terms of, like, you're going to get in somewhere eventually  here.  You know, it's not like you're going to do a couple of improv classes and meet somebody  who does a voiceover thing and rescue a dog and just kill some time, you know, hopefully  before you're 40 years old, you know, something happens.  But here, like, these guys looked up to him because he, like, could dominate these clubs,  and then if he didn't like the clubs, he wouldn't go back. 
[03:02:00]  You know, it wouldn't be like this whole thing of, like, you know, play ball or whatever.  And that's pretty, you know, especially for a guy who is a great comic, you know, you  want to see him perform a lot.  I don't think Patrice, only on his terms, that's all I'm saying.  He never lived a false moment, I don't think.  No.  He just wasn't willing to.  Sometimes he would allow, though, Patrice, and it was his uncomfortability with people  sometimes, he misread situations where he thought that people were being worse than  they were.  And there was times he would go back and realize, like, ah, I probably shouldn't have handled 
[03:02:30]  that that way.  That was self-destructive.  Like, he was also good at looking back with self-analysis and going, ah, fuck that up.  Remember when Chris Rock gave him that speech?  Oh, boy.  We had Chris Rock in and Patrice was in.  Well, I remember, because Chris and I, when we were doing this fucking stupid Pootie Tang,  we were auditioning people, and Patrice was, for both of us, one of our favorite guys.  Yeah.  We loved Patrice, and we wanted to put him in the movie.  And I don't remember which part it was, but there was a big, huge part that was his.  Oh, shit.  As long as he just walked in and just made a basic effort. 
[03:03:00]  And Louie, he was a good actor, right?  He was.  He was a really good actor.  He could act.  He was really good.  And so it was just, let's, you know.  And anyway, Chris and I were, we were working on it together at the time and doing a bunch  of things at once.  And that audition that he did took place without us there.  So we saw a tape.  And we just see him walk in with this script at his side in his big hand.  And he just looks at the camera like, do I have to do this right now?  And he kind of picks up the script with this big, all right. 
[03:03:30]  And just starts reading the lines like, this is shit.  I hate this.  You could see the sweat on his face said, like, I just, I had to walk here from wherever.  I hate this.  And we were like, we really wanted to give him the part, but we couldn't.  Wow.  But we talked about that he was wasting opportunities because of how much talent he had.  And if he could make a few little adjustments to doing exactly what he wants every 10 seconds. 
[03:04:00]  I mean, you know, he might've been seen by more people.  It's hard because we love the guy because he was like that.  And when he made it to 40, it was like, all right, you made it to 40 this way.  Now it's working.  It's just starting to work.  But if he had taken, you know, again, I'm angry he didn't take better care of himself.  It's part of your job.  If you're given, you know, he was giving a vital ingredient to America's comedy.  Right.  And he deprives everybody of it now because he fucking wouldn't stop drinking grape soda. 
[03:04:30]  So, yeah.  And eating McDonald's.  He loved, Spike Lee loved him too.  And he was in 25th Hour.  And Spike uses the same guys over and over and over.  Yeah.  Really?  And, uh, yeah, he does.  I've seen all of his films.  I don't see Spike in here, do you?  Well, there's a good reason.  There's a good reason for that, Dave.  Okay, go ahead.  Yeah, please.  This is called, uh, this is a black bridge that was burned.  Oh, I see.  You think it was just white people he offended? 
[03:05:00]  He was, uh, he had a pilot, like, Spike wanted him to do a project or to hold off on a project.  Like, because it was between Patrice and another guy.  But Spike really liked him.  And, uh, Spike's like, please just don't go out to L.A. for pilot season.  And Patrice just refused to bend.  He would, and he's like, I gotta go out for pilot season.  And Spike's like, I just want you to, can I just keep you on hold?  Because he wouldn't have to use him for that or somebody else.  And Spike actually called him personally.  Which you really don't do.  And he goes, look, I really would like you to do this. 
[03:05:30]  To hold out for me.  And he goes, well, you're calling me.  That's, you know, this is, my agent should be talking to you.  This is, my agent's expressing my wishes.  Oh, my God.  And Spike's like, you won't do it?  And he goes, no.  And Spike goes, all right, then.  And hung up on him.  And that was the last time he spoke to Spike Lee.  I've never heard, I've never heard a revisionist white man telling two black men talking a story.  That'd be like my mom describing a reach around donkey punch.  He took all the spirit and emotion out of it. 
[03:06:00]  And then Spike said, one gentleman puts his penis in him.  I didn't want to jig it up too much.  You may have the road, Patrice.  By my leash.  How was I supposed to say it?  And the one motherfucker's on his phone.  And Spike was all, yo, yo.  Yo, I did it, man.  Yeah, like, set the stage.  It's Brooklyn in a deserted playground.  Hung up that motherfucker.  Hey, chicken.  Look at white pussy.  I don't do good black impressions.  I just do me. 
[03:06:30]  That was pretty good right there.  Thank you very much.  That was pretty good.  Oh, fuck.  You know what?  Don't fuck Spike Lee with his fucking, you know.  He wasn't hiring him.  He wasn't saying, here's money, so don't go get that other money.  But he wasn't asking him to go get money.  He was saying, maybe I'll give you this.  It was like a test.  But now he really, I don't remember the entire story, but he really, uh, I'm not in a position  to say fuck Spike Lee, because I would love to do one of his pictures.  Was this before Katrina?  From Patrice's, from Patrice's dead point of view that's easy to now take, fuck Spike Lee. 
[03:07:00]  I'm going to say through dead Patrice.  And because Patrice, I, Patrice, don't give a fuck about Spike Lee.  And because Patrice is dead and can no longer help me, fuck Patrice, I'm with Spike Lee.  Jesus Christ.  I'll sign with the director who's alive.  Yeah, that's right.  Louie is the only living director in here.  No, but Joe, did you make, you made a movie recently, right?  I made a short film.  With Bobby Kelly.  Oh, there we go.  And Bill Burr. 
[03:07:30]  If I don't say that, I'm going to get screamed at.  It's fucking great.  You're fucking shithead.  We fucking made a fucking...  You fucking Arab cocksucker.  You didn't say my fucking name when you mentioned the fucking movie.  Jesus.  But you know, these guys, Kurt and Joe and like Jay Ocasin and Mike Vickie Allen, these  guys like knew Patrice in the day, right?  Like back in like...  He like kind of like a shepherd you white boys.  Yeah, he really... 
[03:08:00]  Go ahead.  He was nice to white boys.  No, no.  He really was like...  He was, man.  Because you guys used to tell me.  Because his whole principle was like, never get, let somebody give you, you know, hold  something over you they can take away from you.  So that's what like, at the Rose, dude, that was like the most tense, shitty fucking job.  And like, that was, I had to work with him because he wouldn't talk to the writers.  Like, it made like a, dude, it made like a whole stink.  He had his manager call.  I don't think they thought I was in an office separately, but they called the writer's room  just to talk to me.  So the head writer, Ray, picks it up and goes, here, it's for you. 
[03:08:30]  And because he just wanted me to go over his jokes with him.  So they're really territorial with that shit, dude.  Like, that was like a whole thing.  He didn't give a fuck.  And I watched Ray talk to him.  And Ray's a fucking really good writer, but he's like the same kind of like, you know,  the same way Patrice would be as a comic.  He's like that of writers where he won't like...  Ray's a really funny dude.  Yeah, he's a funny dude.  But so, so I watched Ray on the phone, like trying to talk down, like tell Patrice how  he was going to be.  And I just saw Ray silent and his neck turned red.  And I found out later, Patrice, like he told me, man, I don't give a, you ain't the head 
[03:09:00]  writer as shit.  Like, I don't give a, don't ever talk to me that way.  Like, he just like tore, smashed him down.  I was like, wow, dude, you could do that.  I mean, this is just like, this just happened.  You could reason with Patrice and get him to change his opinion, but it had to be voluntary.  You never, ever, we're going to beat him or intimidate him into changing his opinion.  Oh, never.  He wasn't, he didn't choose his battles.  He was like, maybe it's better to let this go.  Yeah.  Fight another day.  Yeah.  He's just like, no, I'm not doing this right in front of me. 
[03:09:30]  I'm not doing it.  But his performance, and we'll all agree on it.  I mean, like, just like even the specials he shot, like usually like when you shoot a  special, they never capture the guy.  Like, I think, I think 88% was captured with him.  Like, I saw at least one half hour with him where like, it just totally fit.  Everything was right.  And the crowd got him.  And, you know, it's good to see because him and I used to talk all the time about like,  we do these crowd, you know, we do these shows different places.  And, you know, it's like, these people were not getting me.  I get walkouts, you know, that kind of stuff. 
[03:10:00]  And like for him, especially because like, you know, I'm a bit of a fag.  Like, I'll, you know, midget joke my way out of it.  He didn't have any of that in there.  You know, he'll fucking go harder and harder.  He was one of those guys.  Yeah.  When it turned ugly on stage, he'd be like, okay, you want to do it like this?  Yeah.  Now, he wouldn't dance around and try to find a way back in with that.  He'd be like, oh, okay, we're enemies now.  There were so many clubs I'd go into improvs at Funny Bones a week after.  And like, Patrice walked about 300 people on the five shows. 
[03:10:30]  We all love that.  Yeah.  I go, did he even, no, he just wanted to walk more.  He didn't care.  Just get the fuck out.  Just go.  Go right now.  When he got sent home from Hilarity's in Cleveland, they fired him, I think, in the beginning  of the week.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Then at the NACA club couldn't create a story.  That's fantastic, right?  Yes.  Just so, I mean, I want to know the details of that.  I want to, I wish I was there for all of that.  Yeah.  Whatever show is the one where they're like, okay, we can't, we can't keep.  You gotta go.  Like what, they tried having the sweet, funny energy middle guy close one of the shows maybe. 
[03:11:00]  Let him middle for the same money.  Let the other guy close and then still, no, he's just gotta, he's gotta go.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  And how does it get to that point?  He's gotta leave Cleveland.  Is there a talk first?  He needs to go home.  I don't know.  It's like they sent him home.  Yeah.  You gotta go home.  You gotta leave.  Yeah.  You're killing us.  Can't even keep the hotel.  We just need to go home.  You need to get out of town.  But you'd envy his integrity.  Like even, like, again, sometimes he made the wrong decision or he was dumb. 
[03:11:30]  But the integrity he had with, I'm not gonna bend and whore myself.  Every comedian envies that because, yeah, the collateral damage is you fuck up some good things.  But the reality is at the end of the day, you never feel like you're a fucking prostitute.  Like you were grabbing your ankles at some point.  Ever.  And I think we all have those moments in our careers.  That's a great name for a pilot.  Grabbing my ankles.  I'm grabbing my ankles here.  On NBC.  When Colin was in here, we missed it because we were on the second wave of people, me and 
[03:12:00]  Russ coming in.  Yes.  We decided it would be better to go to a Baptist church first.  Good for you.  I would have done that.  Yeah, good for you.  It's all right.  You guys, everybody grieves differently.  No, that's good for you.  But did you guys talk about the tough crowd?  Because like the initial grouping of the tough crowd.  Not much, actually.  You didn't?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because people still bring that up to me.  They're like, tough crowd.  And it's always like the same skeevy chick who was like hot 10 years ago. 
[03:12:30]  But she's like, you know, I love that tough crowd.  And then she would go through like, you know, about you guys and how you guys all, you know,  gel together.  And there really was a gel.  And I think we all did bits on that.  You were on it.  A couple of times, yeah.  But like, you guys definitely had that.  They were the core, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you and Patrice.  And Gerardo.  Nick and Gerardo.  And Keith Robinson and Colin.  I mean, it was one of his favorite things he ever did.  It was one of mine.  Colin getting bashed every fucking show.  What host allows himself to be attacked? 
[03:13:00]  Oh, and did you guys kill?  He would just be wearing shorts or some shit.  And you would attack his little Irish legs.  I was watching one recently where we would slap it.  It was Pat Cooper was there.  And Voss and me and Patrice.  And it was five guys instead of four.  And then you would just tag out the guy.  Like if he said something hacky or something awful.  Oh, you'd have to sit down.  Yeah, and you'd have to go to the bench.  We had a bench.  And whoever said something really hacky or if a joke bombed, you got fucking tag teamed out.  That's a great bet. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, it was just an original way to do a talk show.  Watching him slam people on that show was the, you know, I remember watching him and Maren on there one time.  And, you know, Maren's fucking hilarious.  So they started talking about the Bible.  And Maren goes, it ended when it needed to end.  What if there was a Third Testament?  And he started into this Mark Maren thing.  Like you can hear it start.  He goes, and let's say the Third Testament opens up and he got that far.  And you just hear Patrice off camera go, shut up, Mark. 
[03:14:00]  Did you already watch the clip of him trashing Dat Phan at Tough Crap?  Oh, wow.  That was a good one.  That was so great because Dat Phan wants to stick to his Vietnamese guns and doing that voice.  Yeah.  And Patrice just won't fucking.  He's like, will you pull out of the Vietnam Matrix?  I don't have no part of it.  Yeah.  And he's just, I mean, because all his insults, it's like what you were just talking about.  All his insults are like insightful. 
[03:14:30]  Like he scanned you and figured your shit out.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly, man.  Yeah, he didn't just throw out shit that was surface insults.  He knew what the fuck would get you.  He profiled people extremely well.  Extremely well.  Yeah, quickly too.  And that's why when he smashed you with something, it was like, ugh.  It was personal.  Yeah, yeah.  You'd walk into the comedy show and he'd stare you down for like 20 seconds.  He knew it was coming.  You're like, all right, fuck.  And then you got a personalized bashing.  He's been looking at you with the red Terminator screen, like doing an analysis, breaking it down. 
[03:15:00]  He walked people in regular life, not just a joke.  He walked the crowd in a restaurant.  I swear, and when I had to sell her, all the waitresses from Caroline's went down.  They were all dolled up and they all looked hot.  And we're all like, wow, we're going to try to fuck all the waitresses from Caroline's tonight.  And they single file walked out.  And I go, where are you girls going? 
[03:15:30]  And they go, well, it was fun until Patrice showed up and got gone.  Because he just sat there going, ugh, you stink.  I bet you're fucking pussy.  They did stink.  They all did stink.  Yeah, they did.  And it was a great day.  He was right.  The worst was when you'd fucking start dating a girl and you'd bring her into the cellar.  And they were all there.  And you'd see the look.  And you'd be like, oh, fuck.  This is, first of all, I'm going to get attacked in front of her and humiliated.  Because you don't feel like a real comic when fucking five guys are just kicking your teeth in. 
[03:16:00]  Do you remember that?  Do you bring a girl?  Yeah, why would you bring a girl?  It was a tactical error.  Yeah.  You know, you fucking, you want to bring her to the cellar.  Technically, it wasn't a girl.  That's true.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I'm not a supportive girl.  Were you coming from the Mark Twain Awards?  Come on, little lady.  Dude, you know what?  This is starting.  Jim, do you remember that?  When you came in, you came in with that girl and, uh, I remember you came over and asked  him not to be, that was your mistake.  You asked him to not be a dick.  Like, you came to some girl and sat at the back. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, no.  That ain't gonna work.  It was when he was making fun of you for, uh, uh, opening up for dice.  So, you came with this girl and you sat, you tried to sit her away from the, both the table  and the middle table.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And it was right after the dice thing.  So, he starts doing this dice voice at you.  And the top is like, he would not leave you alone.  And you're like, can you please him with a girl?  And then, like, it was like blood in the water.  Like, just like a shark would not stop. 
[03:17:00]  I don't remember.  I vaguely remember asking him, like, just not please.  Please, not tonight, right?  Not tonight, please.  I really like this one.  This is really, I need, we argued about that one time.  I'm like, I need everything to work for me to fuck.  Like, I can't, it has to all work out for me.  You brought it to the wrong place.  You thought you were just gonna walk in like, Dad, this is Henry, it's his place.  Yeah.  Did he really, it really?  Henry.  Jim.  I remember you were pissing girls off and getting laid as a result.  I mean, actually, one time we did Mohegan's Son.  It was right after this, my ex dumped me. 
[03:17:30]  And he was like, he was trying to cheer me up.  So we're sitting in that horrible.  Sure that worked.  That cafeteria in the casino.  He picks out this big fat, like the fattest Dominican girl I've ever seen in my life.  And he just starts talking about fucking me, like really openly in this randomly in a cafeteria.  And I'm horrified.  Like, dude, don't.  He's like, yeah, no, he's got a big dick.  I heard.  Why don't you take it?  And dude, this girl called me up late.  Like, it fucking worked.  Wow.  Did you bang her?  No.  I called my, he had no respect for me.  So I called my ex to come back up and fuck me instead of fuck, I should have fucked that 
[03:18:00]  fat girl.  See, there's a lot of shit I could have would is in this one.  Hey, it's about Patrice.  Yeah.  He should call me up in the middle of the night and ask if I was hungry.  It was amazing.  I love the Mohegan's Son.  In the cafeteria?  In the cafeteria.  In the cafeteria.  He just picked up a fat image.  God, we live the worst fucking lives in the world, don't we?  Yeah.  He'd get you laid.  The only stipulation was you had to fuck a girl that looked like Patrice. 
[03:18:30]  I know, we're talking about him like he was fucking, like he was Nicholson in the  70s.  He helped you fuck a fat chick in a cafeteria.  I didn't even do it.  What a life.  What a shame.  What a loss.  I can't believe that came to him all.  Trying to hook up a fat Dominican chick in a fucking...  After she just did a double shift and she smelled like fucking food.  I should have done it.  I really should have done it.  I should have fucked that fat chick.  For the story, yeah.  Did you guys do that roast of Patrice at...  Yeah, Boston, I think.  I believe Boston.  Because I remember all the comics were like, hey, we're... 
[03:19:00]  You know, there was like a big wave of people like, what's all the excitement?  Where's everyone going?  They're like, they're roasting Patrice over at the...  Like it was like a lynching in the 20s.  Like just like trickle-faced guys who are no longer comics and just like weird...  You know, like ventriloquists were running over, magicians, everybody like, we're going  to get them.  And then all these long faces leaving because Patrice can hold his own.  Like in that animal video where the wildebeest like saves the smaller beast from the skater. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, like that.  He can hold his own.  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  I think I remember that.  Is that where Keith bombed?  Yes, I think that was the one where Keith went up and tried to just improv.  Like, why are we both in this, man?  Fuck, I remember that.  That was the one.  Yeah, he came in late.  He came in late and just went right up to the fucking...  Nothing prepared at all.  And that's like 2003 or something.  Because we were off the air.  We were on the air, man.  And I remember I wasn't sitting next to you.  And one of the comedians pointed out how I wasn't sitting next to you and how I sold 
[03:20:00]  you out because we were off the air.  That's how I know when that was.  I think it was 2003.  Yeah.  Jumped on.  Collins Coattails was the joke.  Yeah.  Went from West to him.  Yeah.  That's sad.  I love his bits about being paranoid as a black guy.  Like, not one...  If he threw away a soda...  That was fucking brilliant.  He didn't throw it out on the street because it might land next to somebody, like some dead  girl.  A dead white girl.  He'd be the Coca-Cola killer.  The Pepsi-Cola rapist.  He's like, go over a hill and land by a dead white girl. 
[03:20:30]  And he'd always get a receipt.  So it was marked by the time it was.  By gum.  That's actually...  You know what?  I think there was some truth in that, too.  No, there was.  You can tell.  That's why it was funny.  But that's what it was like a totally other thing.  Yeah.  It's like...  I remember reading a thing about Rocky when they made that movie and that Stallone was  peddling the script.  Nobody wanted to make it.  Right.  And then whoever made it, the guy, producer, said he's reading yet another boxing picture.  Like, there's so many. 
[03:21:00]  Who's going to want to make this?  And then he goes...  And then three pages in, this guy's talking to his turtles.  And I'm like, what is this?  And it made him pay attention.  That's what Patrice was like.  He's like, here's another big black comedian on stage.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to watch him with one eye open.  And then he's talking about this Pepsi Cola rapist thing and these silly, silly, weird,  totally different insight into being a huge black guy than anybody.  And you go, wait a minute.  A whole other thing.  I thought you were going into a different direction where you were saying trying to convince him  of something was as frustrating as talking to turtles. 
[03:21:30]  You have a better shot at winning an argument with them.  But we all agree he was black.  He was black.  At the end of this, we're all going to say he was black.  Oh, man.  Really.  From Boston, too.  He was a black guy from Boston.  So, Louie, do you think you ever met him as a child?  No.  Oh, no.  Because you're from a different town.  No, Boston, no.  Totally segregated.  Would you say, like... 
[03:22:00]  Boston is, I mean, I don't...  Well, you know.  Giantly different.  Like Nick DiPaolo probably...  Never saw me.  Never.  No.  Maybe in a school bus.  They did not walk on the same street.  Nick would even sit on the couch with him on Tough Crowd.  No, every time I had a Boston comedian over, like, sometimes a Boston comedian would call  me when I first moved here and ask to stay with me to try to be in New York, and we'd  be, like, on the Upper West Side, and he'd be like, you live in a black neighborhood?  Like, literally, all the time.  You see any black people, it must be a black neighborhood, yeah. 
[03:22:30]  Four black people per 20 blocks.  This is a black neighborhood, but...  No, so, no, Patrice.  I don't know what part of Boston he was from.  Roxbury.  Roxbury.  Yep.  That's a good place, right?  That's a good place.  He was the best to argue race with, though, because even when, like, for hours, because  even when you didn't agree with it, he always had a great point of view.  It was like...  And you always had to respect what he was saying.  It's like, it wasn't just the typical black guy sounding off about race.  Right.  It was a well-thought-out point, and he was right about white racism. 
[03:23:00]  He knew more about white culture than any black guy I've ever talked to.  More than most white people.  Yeah, I've talked to three or four.  No, and he was basically a very...  Yes.  I just realized who was talking to me.  Yeah, actually, actually, this is too...  Actually, it was two of them, and you talked to them both twice.  This is too...  I thought it was two of them before every guy...  This is too white on black.  Let's ask somebody of a different creed.  Ross, you're kind of Asian.  Right.  You'll have to stand up for our only celestial in the room. 
[03:23:30]  No, but he was fair.  I mean, like Jim said, it wasn't a knee-jerk, black response.  He was fair, and he stood up for white people as well.  And he didn't like white women, which threw me immediately, being a black comic.  He slept with a few, though.  He didn't have it back more than anything.  That he didn't like white women.  That he didn't like white...  You know, he didn't bang white chicks.  No, he did sleep with a few white chicks.  I know, but it didn't help his career like a lot of the other...  Like you're Sammy Davis.  Yes, you're Don.  Ross and I were talking about something that we're the weakest generation of comics on the way down there. 
[03:24:00]  Because we're like, think about it.  Don Rickles.  Joan Rivers.  People have been through wars.  Just all these amazing things.  They're still going.  You know, it's like us.  You know, who knows what's going to happen?  It's just going down so fast.  Yeah, all of our guys.  Yeah, Freddie Roman is still around.  All of our best guys.  Yeah.  You know.  Freddie Roman.  I mean, yeah.  Like, just so many...  Jackie Mason alone.  Like, he's doing something right now.  Who knows what he's doing?  Exactly.  That's a frightening thought.  The cast of denying the fraternity of...  The cast of hot and cleaners. 
[03:24:30]  That's true.  We've lost a lot.  Hedberg.  This year.  Oh, yeah.  I can go further back.  Oh, yeah.  Jerry Red Wilson.  Jerry Red Wilson.  Fuck, yeah, Jerry.  This year it was...  Schimmel.  Schimmel.  Schimmel.  It started with Jenny.  Richard Jenny.  I guess you could say that was, like, in the...  Drake Sather.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  Died the same way.  That was...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was the shooting.  Shooting yourself.  Wow.  This is depressing.  Patrice DiStefano.  Hedberg. 
[03:25:00]  Giraldo.  Mike DiStefano.  Freddie Soto.  Freddie Soto.  That's right, yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Comics die more than rappers, dude.  They really do.  They do.  Rappers are healthy now.  They live a good life.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're all drinking wheatgrass.  What happened to you guys?  Criminals.  Vitamin water.  Wheatgrass and Red Bull.  Is there anything the fans can do, like any donation set up by the family?  Honestly, what I think is...  We're going to figure it all out. 
[03:25:30]  Do they need money or...  No, but I think a show of support, because I'm doing McGuby's in Baltimore this weekend.  And I really think, to get those shows sold out, it's what he would have wanted.  I was waiting for Jim to break the ice, because I'm at Mohican Sun.  We were talking about the cafeteria, but I can't.  And I was waiting.  I knew he was going to do it.  Of course.  Waiting for his lead.  It's what he would have wanted.  Of course.  A full house for me.  It's what he would have wanted.  To answer Dave's question, we'll figure it all out. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, we'll do something, obviously.  We'll absolutely do something.  I don't know what, but...  Yeah, we don't know yet.  We don't know what's going on yet.  Yeah.  Weird time.  I assume his family and all that want their whatever service.  There will be a service.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're already looking for a church, and I think...  Is it going to be in New York, or...?  I think New York.  I'm not sure, though.  I don't know if it's been decided, but they'll probably know by today or tomorrow.  So, you know, everybody will find out.  I just don't know exactly what day.  Next week sometime, maybe? 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, it was so hard to, like, just even sleep last night.  Every time you start dozing off, you just think about it.  He rocked on this show.  You guys really...  We were fortunate, man.  No, you guys were very cool to bring him on and, like, let him be himself.  Are you kidding me?  If he sucked, he wouldn't have fucking...  Yeah, no.  He was so good at just talking about anything.  Yeah, he really was.  He was so insightful, you know, and a lot of listeners would write in and say shit like,  oh, I don't agree with him.  Fuck.  Fuck his opinion on this. 
[03:27:00]  It's like...  Is that really what they said?  No, they...  All right.  Get that mistook out of here!  Yes, they did.  What's that cantaloupe doing?  Your crowd's a little, you know...  That guy's a real nincompoop.  A little rough.  A little rough around the edge.  A little berry.  There's no Occupy...  You got the Outback Steakhouse crowd.  You got the Occupy Wall Street.  Look, this was fun.  Yeah, it really, really...  It goes back to sucking. 
[03:27:30]  Made me laugh a lot today.  Just talking about all that shit.  It's still very hard to watch videos and shit like that.  It's impossible to digest at this point.  It's so hard to do that.  Yeah.  It's impossible to digest at this point.  Yeah, you can't.  It's a goddamn shame.  You know, I was on my way out to see him, and I got the phone call yesterday morning.  Did you get to see him in the hospital?  Yeah.  Look at that U-turn.  I didn't see him.  We went the day before Thanksgiving, me and Matt Frost.  And you just talked to him for a few minutes.  You knew he couldn't hear you.  I told him everybody was asking for him.  And, you know, hoping he could hear, but kind of hoping he couldn't, you know? 
[03:28:00]  Because he was on morphine.  It's like, you don't want him to know.  Yeah, yeah.  It was very, very sad.  He wasn't responsive at all?  No, not at all.  I don't believe so.  He might have made some type of a gesture, but you don't know if that's just...  Jesus.  Oh, that's horrible.  You don't know if that's involuntary.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For somebody so mentally outspoken...  That's just it, yeah.  To be, like, in a locked-in syndrome, that's horrible.  It's a fate worse than death. 
[03:28:30]  Do you think he recognized seeing you guys?  I don't know.  Because we came...  We didn't know he was going to die in a few days, but by then I think he was very heavily  medicated again.  And it was just...  So I'm almost hoping he didn't know, or it filtered in somehow.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Good that we had a lot of laughs and ended on a great note.  I think the fans wanted to know, too.  That's such a sad...  Yeah.  Watching it is a blessing, then.  No, I know, yeah.  Because somebody like that, you just... 
[03:29:00]  You don't want to think that they're put in a position where they're cognitive...  They know exactly what's going on, but they can't express themselves.  Yeah.  Because that's what he did so well.  Do you know how bizarre it is to have a one-way conversation with Patrice O'Neill?  It's the most surreal thing I ever did in my life.  I'm like, I could just say anything and you can't respond.  Oh, I wish I had this opportunity years ago.  You should have spent 12 hours there.  Oh, just trying my jokes on him. 
[03:29:30]  Patrice, everybody misses you.  We hope you're well.  Black people are responsible for their own plight.  And you know what, dude?  Look, white pussy, I'm sorry, but it's better.  And I know you're in there thinking I'm right.  I know you're inside there and you can hear me and you know I'm right.  Oh, I should have done that.  And I'll tell everybody you said so.  And that's how you'll be remembered.  And played like Judas Priest and Ozzy and things that he would really fucking hate.  Jesus, I brought you Joe's mixtape.  Joe's stupid mixtape. 
[03:30:00]  Hey, I got Joe's Comedy Central special here I'm going to put on for you.  I should just put on all the comedians.  Not just, no, no, but all the comedians.  I should have just put on.  Because he never would have wanted to just sit there and have comedians playing.  That would have been a fucking fate.  What a nightmare.  Oh, like the anthology of improv.  That would be great.  He was the whitest kid you know.  Come on, guys.  The French Raider sketch.  Oh, my God.  But you wouldn't hear anything.  You would just hear like, do, do, do, do, do.  The ultimate focus group. 
[03:30:30]  There was nothing worse for me than being on.  The stage is a cellar and Purchese had to go to the bathroom.  I'm walking by that stage and I'm just shaking his head at you like, you stink.  Nothing worse.  I would just pray he didn't have to go piss when I was on stage.  I got that look every time.  I used to go on the road with him to open for him sometimes and he'd sit in the wing like  of the stage or whatever and you'd walk off stage.  You'd have a good set.  You'd walk off stage.  You'd get applause.  And he'd just be shaking his head going, I guess I'll go try to clean up that fucking 
[03:31:00]  mess.  Well, I had my recorder on the side, you know, where Patrice was sitting and then I go home  and listen to the tape.  The whole tape was him telling me how much I sucked.  Oh, shit.  That's great.  So funny.  The first time I met him, Jamie Duke, I might have told this story recently, but Jamie Duke,  it was a local booker.  He had set up a college.  It was me opening Patrice Middling and Dom Fig headlining. 
[03:31:30]  You remember Dom?  Oh, God.  And it was a horrible...  He became the vampire of comedy after a while.  The vampire comedian.  He was the vampire of comedy.  What?  What do you mean?  Well, he decided, well, he was Dom Fig for about 40 years of stand-up and then he decided  to be the vampire of comedy.  So he put in teeth.  Oh, no.  And he said, well, he got white makeup on.  No.  But he would wear a fanny pack on stage.  He had a fanny pack that he had his stuff in, but he didn't take it off.  He was like the vampire with the fanny pack. 
[03:32:00]  But he would do...  I asked him gently, so why are you doing the...  being the vampire of comedy?  And he said, I'll be on every show because I'm the only one that...  I'm the only vampire of comedy.  Yeah.  So they'll have to have me on every show.  Wow.  I will be on every show.  Did it work?  Yeah, he hosted SNL.  He's in the new Twilight movie.  I fucking...  It was a new...  It was ahead of his time, dude.  It was an afternoon gig in a fucking college and it was horrible. 
[03:32:30]  And I bombed and Patrice, who I'd never met before, went on.  And he didn't do much better.  I might have had a one.  Maybe he had a two and a half.  Wait, he did a college gig?  Yeah, this is many years ago.  That is the ultimate bad, no, bad booking.  And then Dom Fig went on and fucking had like a minus three.  And fucking Patrice, I had to drive him back to New York.  And he really...  And he's making fun of me because I was acknowledging that I was bombing.  He's like, you're up there like, hey, I tell you, no respect.  And he's just attacking me like I bombed.  And I'm like, you fucking bombed too.  He's like, no, I didn't. 
[03:33:00]  I'm like, you fucking asshole.  I hated it.  I hated Patrice when I first...  This fucking pompous idiot really thought he did well.  You really couldn't stand him at that moment, right?  Oh, motherfucker.  I hated him the first time.  I think that was the way people took you.  You hated him the first time.  The next time you see him, you're like, oh, there's that guy.  There's that asshole guy.  But if you start there with somebody, there's like nothing...  What else is he going to do?  Going up.  And he'll charm you.  Anything he says, you're like, he's all right.  He's all right.  Part of the burden of like...  It was always like, I always said hello to him the wrong way or something. 
[03:33:30]  So like...  Yeah.  One time I slapped him on the back.  He's like, don't you ever come up to me.  I'm like, all right.  Yeah.  It's like an emotional burden to approach him.  No, sometimes I see him and I'm like, I'm not sure exactly the perfect way to say hi  to him.  I don't want to...  I don't even want to try.  I'm going to get called out on some bullshit just for...  What's up, Patrice?  Oh, come on with that.  What's up?  Yeah, I don't want to examine my whole life every time.  We were driving back from Montreal once and we were lost.  We couldn't find the highway and we pull up to this guy at a stoplight. 
[03:34:00]  Patrice puts his head up the window and goes, excuse me, sir.  Excuse me, kind sir.  I need directions to the highway.  Could you please direct me and my lost friends, please?  Right?  And the guy goes, yeah, sure, man.  You just go...  And he just fucking rolls up his window as the guy's going in the directions.  And we're laughing so hard.  And he's going...  And then he just goes, ah, goddammit, I can't do it. 
[03:34:30]  And he rolled his window down.  He goes, I'm sorry, man.  I'm sorry.  Give me the fucking directions.  He was telling me a story about a comedian he was having a problem in Boston that was  bad-mouthing him and giving him a hard time.  So Patrice just calls him up on the phone and he says, you know, I hear you're bad-mouthing  me.  You're saying all this shit.  And he says, next time you're on stage...  And very calmly, he's like, I'm just going to walk in and I'm going to throw a chair at  you.  And then we're just going to see where it goes from there.  And I'll just keep throwing chairs. 
[03:35:00]  Just the way he so calmly said it to me.  I'm just going to throw a chair at you.  That's one thing he wasn't, though.  Like, Patrice would emotionally bully people, but he never, ever used his physical imposing...  Other than what people would be nervous of by just looking at him.  Never tried to physically bully people.  But I mean, never even tried to impose his size.  It was all fucking his voice and his booming opinions. 
[03:35:30]  He never tried to physically bully people.  Yeah, but the size was...  People would take that, but he didn't use it.  Yeah, but Jim, you were the best wife you've ever had.  He never laid a hand on me.  I just can't shit without crying.  No matter how cold supper was...  He would only make me feel awful.  He would just yell at me.  Never laid a hand on me.  He assassinated my character.  He made me hate myself.  But he never laid a hand on me, not one time.  Oh, shit. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, he would never do that.  Never.  Not even close.  All psychological damage.  Why bother?  He didn't need to.  Like I said earlier, he totally diffused his huge size with what he had to say.  Because he was smart.  He was really smart.  As soon as you realized that, and the best was watching a comic try to fucking go back  and forth with him.  And it's like, oh, you're one of those guys who doesn't understand that he's a lot brighter  than you.  Yeah, he really is.  He's going to really humiliate you on a visceral level.  He was the first guy during the 9-11 thing, whatever, during the war, whatever, where he 
[03:36:30]  goes, you know, Muslims, you now are the new, you know, and we're you guys.  Like, he was the first guy who did that.  And he did it, like, a lot smarter in class here than I've heard it a million times since  that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was the first guy to make that connection.  Even when he did Letterman, remember, when he gets up there, he goes, Patrice, you're  a big guy.  I goes, you just call me fat.  He goes, no, no, no, you just call me fat.  That's okay.  But you just call me fat.  Like, right off the bat, his first time on there, attacks Letterman 10 seconds a year. 
[03:37:00]  And only time.  And only time.  Yeah, the only time.  They can't have that.  Oh, shit, man.  Wow.  I guess, uh...  What?  I'm sorry.  I was going to ask Jim a question, because you probably know.  Was he the kind of what you were talking about?  I write a lot, and I just...  Oh, sorry.  I'm so much for giving advice.  Was he the kind of guy...  But actually, like, would he fight if it came down to it? 
[03:37:30]  Like, he seemed so non-violent in any way.  Like, would he just walk away, or would he...  You know what I mean?  I think he would have.  Sure.  He played football, and people didn't want to try him.  I remember there was a...  He was a bouncer.  I mean, he...  He was a strong guy.  He was very, very strong.  He grabbed me once, just playing around.  And you felt that he was very strong.  Was it in a shower?  Let's move forward.  We were in a car one time in the village, and the guy...  It was the black guys in front of us, and their car stopped. 
[03:38:00]  And there was a cab behind us, beeping.  And so the fucking black guys in front of us kind of got out of their car and thought it  was Patrice.  And it was going to be a physical thing.  And the guy said, uh...  And Patrice was like, hey, gangster, it's him.  And the way he spoke to the guy, you realize that he wasn't afraid of a physical confrontation.  The guy didn't back him off.  It was interesting to see him in that, because I'd never seen him in a situation where there  could be a physical problem.  And he handled it very well.  He was super intimidating.  He was really intimidating.  He had the hat on. 
[03:38:30]  And you just didn't know what he was capable of.  So yeah, of course, I think he would have if he had to.  But I've never seen him get out of that car, because the last three times I did see him,  he was in that car.  He would pull up.  And then you'd go over to him, and he would talk to you.  Like, you used to say, like, the show Cannon, where he would pull up, and then you'd talk  to him.  And you'd bend him down or something.  And then you'd run off.  And you'd talk to him, like, when you're talking to a guy in a wheelchair, and you kind of have  to take a knee so you could talk to him.  He'd go, like...  I guess he didn't want to go in the cellar, or didn't, like, feel comfortable there for  a while.  It was a very uncomfortable thing. 
[03:39:00]  He'd be like, who else is in there?  And you'd be like, so-and-so's in there.  He goes, well, tell him I'm out here.  So then you'd go in there, and go, like, hey, Patrice is outside.  Talk to him.  And, like, we all would just come out and talk to him in a car.  It was like talking to Pauly from Goodfellas.  We had to go to somebody, get them out.  He'd pull up, like, the ice cream man.  Everybody fucking ran out.  And then you'd be out there talking to him, like, why did I come out here?  It was nice inside.  I was having fun.  And this is toxic.  Why did I walk outside to be insulted by an asshole in a fucking six-seat escalade? 
[03:39:30]  What's the ultimate, like, insult to you, like, that he did?  Because I know, like, you and him went back and forth and back.  He said so many funny.  One time I was getting a tough crowd.  They had chair massages.  And I was flirting with the chair masseuse.  And he walked in.  He goes, he asked her, he goes, do you feel like you're checking a piece of fruit to see  if it's bad?  Which was humiliating.  Because she laughed at me.  I remember when we went on the virus tour once, and we were sitting at the table signing 
[03:40:00]  people's shit afterwards.  Right.  And I was sitting next to Patrice.  And some kid, some teenage kid says, I'm only 15.  And he was, like, bragging about how he was a teenager.  And then he asked me to sign his underwear.  Like, he pulled his underwear up out of his jeans.  And he asked me to sign his underwear.  So I'm like, I don't give a shit.  But I go for it with a Sharpie.  And Patrice slaps the Sharpie out of my hand, literally.  And goes, what?  You're going to sign a teenage boy's underwear?  You know how fast you're going to be in jail? 
[03:40:30]  Like, he smacked me.  He said, what are you doing?  He really would hang out after his show and, like, talk to all the fucking people that,  you know, didn't walk out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wasn't like, I mean, I remember him telling me, like, I always hate that.  Like, I want to go get the fuck out of there.  And he was, like, always, he would always hang out with all of them.  Like, even if they hated his guts and talked to every single person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the crowd, I saw him once in Cleveland.  And the crowd was just, like, every fucking mixture of race and greed, color. 
[03:41:00]  Always.  Yeah.  You know, there'd be the black people that would come in.  The black contingency would come in.  And then the white people would come in.  It just, really, he wasn't pigeonholed into a group of people.  Yeah.  You didn't see him rageful very often.  Very, very rarely would you see him like that fucking.  But you once in a while saw it.  And it was just a very rare thing.  He never had to get to that level of just fucking visceral anger.  Like, Bob will get to it quickly or I'll get to it quickly. 
[03:41:30]  But he didn't have that fear.  Louie said it really well.  He had, Bobby had this fear of he doesn't exist if he's not fucking exploding.  But, I mean, that's how I am, too.  And it was interesting to see Patrice would never get to that point of rage when you're arguing.  He could be louder than you.  He said that to people at times, you're not going to be louder than me.  And you're like, yeah, that's a good point.  You're not.  Yeah.  I remember many times he'd be talking about something here, if you want to call it talking.  And Opie's just pulling the fader back down, down, down.  And it just, at some point, it sounded like he was talking through a paper and a comb. 
[03:42:00]  That's what, you know what, it had a great effect, though, on this show.  That his, when he'd get upset, he'd start sounding off mic.  Because you'd actually start hearing him on everybody else's mic.  His was off at one point.  He would go from it and he'd be like, and now, and another thing.  And it had a, it had its own thing to it.  Yeah.  Fuck.  I wish he'd gone for a couple of walks, that's all.  Yeah, I know, right?  I mean, that's what I was telling my kids. 
[03:42:30]  Like, I wish now I had gone to his house and just said, get the fuck, let's go, we're going for a walk.  No, he wouldn't.  Just walk around the block with me, you fat motherfucker.  You're going to die.  Because you joke about that stuff when you know somebody who's unhealthy.  Ah, he's not going to make it.  But when you're around 40, it's no joke anymore.  You can't do it anymore.  At least it starts breaking down.  How do you understand this shit?  I don't know what you do with a person who's alive when they're not taking care of themselves.  Do you learn from this shit?  I don't know.  What do you do? 
[03:43:00]  I don't know.  This is just brutal.  I mean, I remember when Geraldo was in the hospital, I thought he'll be okay.  Right.  And when he comes out, I'm going to call him and say, hey, man, I don't drink.  If you want to go to a movie sometime.  Maybe a hard thing about being addicted is that everybody you know does it.  And, you know, I don't do anything.  And by the way, never once.  Never once has somebody been jonesing for coke and they said, all right, instead of getting  high, I'm going to go to a movie with Louis CK.  What, you fucking little house on the prairie? 
[03:43:30]  Just make some cornmeal.  Really like talking yourself up or really talking coke down.  Go to the pictures.  They'll be fine.  The picture show.  Coke is like going to the movies alone.  You people don't understand.  It's hard.  There's two competing things you want to do so bad.  Dave, how do you make sense of this?  Do you?  Actually, you know, there's two ways to look at it.  One of them is Louis' way, which is like, you know, it would be great if he had cleaned  up his act.  The other one is that, like, you know, I consider him like one of the last great, dirty, filthy, 
[03:44:00]  genius warrior comics and that, you know, I think he, unlike a lot of the people in this  world, got to live, say, and do pretty much everything he wanted to do.  It's kind of sad that he left so early.  But, you know, to be honest, I think he wouldn't have wanted it any other way.  You know, it's a sad end.  But from seeing this over and over and over, it's like, you know, the guy was incredible 
[03:44:30]  at what he did.  And we're just kind of lucky that we all got a chance to see it live and get to know  it.  And for the fans of Patrice and comedy like that, you know, you know, really that kind  of comedy is not going to be there forever.  So, you know, it's every day it's getting a little it's a little tamer.  It's a little lamer and it's a little more, you know, crunchy.  So, you know, if you like somebody brutally great like that, you should really, like,  you know, go see it live. 
[03:45:00]  And I think that's that's the point of it.  But I have no I have no answer on what it is.  It just he would have been he was getting better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And his voice would have been more.  It would have just gotten better.  It's not like it's not like being an athlete where you just have your golden years and you  phase out comedies.  You get better when you're mature.  Dave's getting better.  Everybody I know is getting better as they get older.  I'm holding, I think.  I'm holding where I am.  You've gotten better.  Thank you. 
[03:45:30]  And Jim's gotten better.  Jim is a whole other guy.  You get older and you get better.  I like this guy.  He would have gotten better.  So, you know, he had this fuck you, fuck it attitude.  But if he if he had just fucking the calories down, it wasn't like it because he would be  better.  We'd have more Patrice and better Patrice if he had just fucking lived longer.  Just it's just sad.  It's a sad to me.  If we're 65 and talking.  Or we had no, I am.  Comedians do with 65. 
[03:46:00]  We're talking.  That'd be like 24 more years.  We could have had him like everybody's right on the thing.  It's like he did do what he wanted and he did say whatever he wanted.  You're right.  And Louie's right, too.  It's like, hey, man, I wish he would take a little better care of himself.  Well, that's not a guarantee because he was diabetic.  But you kind of wish that he you would have known that that wasn't the case.  Sure.  I don't.  I'm glad I was as good a friend with him as I was.  Yes.  I'm happy that I was as close to him as I was.  What bums me out is an avoidable loss of a great voice.  An avoidable one. 
[03:46:30]  That's a drag to me.  Yeah.  But Geraldo was an avoidable loss.  Like when Mitch died, some people were like, don't focus.  Like when people were saying that he was, that he had died of an overdose.  Some people were like, well, don't focus on the negativity of his.  No, do focus on it.  Because the fucking guy was in his 30s.  Yeah.  And he could have had a huge life and career and he could have given a lot more.  Uh, and he died of something that it should be pointed out what killed him that doesn't  have to kill a person.  Right.  That's a fucking mistake.  And some people take that shit lightly.  Some people go, ah, you fuck around with drugs. 
[03:47:00]  And so, well, no, it kills you if you keep doing it.  If, and, and that's, that's sad.  It doesn't have to be.  So, you know, I wish he'd taken better care of himself.  That's all.  That's if the, if the only thing, if there's any positive to come out of it, it's like if  somebody's not healthy, it's not a joke.  You could fucking die and it's a shame.  It's a message for the younger guys.  That's all.  Take care of yourself.  Yeah.  It really sucks how much hacks take care of their bodies.  Hacks are always in great shape.  Yeah, exactly.  Prop comics. 
[03:47:30]  It's gone through to the act.  Fucking, you know, packing.  Lifting that suitcase full of props.  Steve Byrne is cut like a swimmer.  That guy's got a swimmer.  Sorry.  I just picked a name.  I don't even know his name and my name.  Still know that's funny.  But that was the saddest moment to me yesterday was when I saw, when I saw the Wikipedia turn  over because in the morning when it went out on Twitter, it didn't have the death on  the Wikipedia.  And when I saw Wikipedia turn over and it said Patrice died on this day, it was so sad to 
[03:48:00]  me because it was that moment where it officially became number one, that he was gone.  And number two, I was like, he's officially one of those guys now.  Now, he's this brilliant artist that, just like the guys I found a million times, discovered,  and then you go on Wikipedia and go, I want to learn more about this guy.  And then you go, fuck, he's dead.  Fuck, yeah.  There's an end to it.  This guy's dead?  That's it?  Well, now he's embossed at that age now.  Right.  That's the end to it.  Really sad.  Yeah, that is.  I hate the idea of not getting any new, something new that I haven't heard. 
[03:48:30]  When he did a half hour special back when we did them at the, there was a bunch of HBO  half hours that got done.  And he did one when I did one.  Did you do one of those half hours?  I didn't remember that.  I did a half hour.  And he, it was a new thing for him.  Like, it was something that he was unsure of.  And I remember the first show he did, he almost like froze, like he couldn't get through  the show.  And then the second show was good.  But it wasn't his best.  Like, it was way, people weren't seeing how good he was.  Dude, Elephant in the Room is where it came out.  But then he fucking figured it out. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, that's sad.  And he, he, that was it.  That was him going like, and now people actually see how good he was.  He could have done 10 of those.  That captured his exact...  He could have just started churning those out.  It would have changed every, it would have changed the tide for him.  He was just naturally funny.  And I compared him in an interview yesterday briefly to Pryor because, yeah, Pryor was Pryor.  But as a naturally funny human being, there's nobody, no comic who ever lived that Patrice  couldn't have sat and been funny with.  Right.  There's no fucking comedian that we call legends that he could not have sat in a room 
[03:49:30]  with and gone back and forth with and been respected by and been funny with.  No one.  Effortlessly.  No one.  Not one comic.  Yeah, go ahead.  When he went on at that roast at the end, that was like the most amazing thing I ever  saw.  Yeah.  Because I had like four, at least four like comedy central importance that I don't even  know like what all their jobs are.  Like, is he going to be okay?  Is his, we don't have his thing?  And I'm like, yeah, he'll be fine.  They were like getting to me like, or I'll find like, yeah, he's going to be great.  Like, and if not, it's not my fault.  And he went on and like, I mean, he just, uh, what's Kate Walsh's boyfriend? 
[03:50:00]  This guy, Chris something.  He's like a producer.  I remember sitting there watching Patrice today and he goes, wow, this is so different  and real.  Like it was so different.  I mean, they, they cut it pretty decent where you get a sense, but the actual thing there,  like after all these people got done with their like recited jokes, even the ones that  were good, like he shit was so fresh.  And so he's so unafraid of all these fucking Hollywood is amazing.  But he had to, because he was so uncompromising, he had to figure out how to make that work  at all these different levels.  Yeah.  That's why he took it.  I mean, it takes, comedy takes a long time to get great at.  Like some people get good at it fast, but it takes a long time to become a great comic. 
[03:50:30]  So like the only thing you can tell anybody new is keep refining your voice and stay healthy  and get on the treadmill.  Just stay fucking, just stay alive.  If you just stay alive and don't quit, you will be one of the best comedians that ever  lives.  That's all you gotta do is survive.  It's pretty simple.  Yeah.  That's what I remember.  Live your way into greatness.  Right.  I did a show in Chicago in, uh, at the, the little club there at Zanies. 
[03:51:00]  And it was like, I had the week and then Ralphie May had the Thursday.  It was one of these things where he just sold mad tickets.  So they just told me Ralphie's doing Thursday.  I'm like, this is my week.  And they're like, well, you can come and do the show if you want.  Cause it's already, it's sold out in 10 minutes.  So he came and did a show during my week.  And then he had an opening act who travels with him.  Some young guy was pretty funny.  And he said, uh, and he was sort of in Ralphie's orbit.  Uh, not just cause he's a planet.  He was one of those guys who had guys with him, like an entourage. 
[03:51:30]  And he said, what, do you got any advice?  I said, yeah, stop, uh, traveling and getting high with Ralphie May.  Like don't, that road to your run of like getting stoned with Ralphie, going to McDonald's  with him, drinking several beers at the end of every show.  You can do it and enjoy it.  It's a choice, but you're not going to be, you're not going to get to the next.  You're not going to get there.  Right.  It takes a long fucking time.  Yeah.  It's a grown, you know, stroke, by the way.  Jesus.  Well, you know, see where he hides his weed, Ralphie? 
[03:52:00]  No.  He pulls his pants.  It's under his fat flap.  All right, guys, what is this, a witch hunt?  He's a gay man.  I got a hiding spot.  I was a gay man.  He's got the one white guy that we have that's alive.  He was in the hospital recently.  Just be white is really dark.  Nothing went through his own thing recently, right?  What happened?  I don't know.  No.  He's in bad shape for a little bit.  I'm not sure where he's at right now, but so now a shitload of people discover Patrice  now that he's gone.  Yeah, that's the best thing you can do as far as. 
[03:52:30]  That's so fucked up, though.  Yeah.  Go see Elephant in the Room.  It's on Netflix now.  Buy it, yeah.  I think it's going to be on the Central Thursday night.  Yeah, but you've got to see the uncut one.  See the uncut one.  Fuck those people.  There's so much extra shit in there that I didn't realize was in there.  It's like an hour and a half, right?  It's an hour and 17 minutes.  Hour and 17.  Yeah, it's fantastic.  All right, guys.  It's just going to be a bummer when things happen and you're in the news and you go like,  oh, I would love to hear Patrice's take on that.  And, you know, unfortunately, eh, socks. 
[03:53:00]  You can probably guess what it would be, though.  Oh, you can.  Yeah.  The crinkled nose.  He would have hated her.  He would have hated her.  Yeah.  Well, I want to thank everyone for coming in today.  Absolutely, man.  Thanks for having us, guys.  It was in 84 hours.  Yeah.  Dave and Jim and Lou and Joe DeRosa and Russman Eve and Kurt Metzger and Colin and Bob and  Amy.  Colin and Amy just left.  Well, Colin said goodbye.  Oh, I was in the bathroom. 
[03:53:30]  Amy, just how about some social skills?  How about saying goodbye?  I think she was scheduled for, like, another naked headshot or something.  Good.  There were a lot of comics that wanted to come in today to do their, you know, to be a part  of this.  So, guys, that was really cool that you let us come in.  So, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Tomorrow we do the same time.  Just get us at 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  This was kind of the warm-up.  We were like the guys who used the first show.  Tomorrow will be Steve Martin, you know, the surviving Hudson brother. 
[03:54:00]  Holy shit.  The original Mork before they went with Robin Williams.  Pilot Mork.  The surviving cast of What's Happening.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Everyone's good.  Thanks, guys.  Patrice, we miss you.  Bye, Patrice.  Absolutely.  I don't think he's listening, though.  All right, guys.  That's it, I guess.  I'm going to end this and just fucking hit something.  And now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues. 
[03:54:30]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  We're on.  It's After O.P. and Anthony Live, brought to you by Trojan Bearskin Condoms, Trojan America's  number one most trusted condo brand, and an amazing show today, a tribute to Patrice.  And it goes to show you how much he meant that, how many people. 
[03:55:00]  I mean, on the one show today, you know, if you missed any of it, make sure you check  out the replay, because we're doing some special stuff for the weekend, so I don't think we'll  be able to replay this show.  This show isn't going to be part of the weekend.  Yes, it is.  You're going to include this?  Oh, there's so much stuff.  There's going to be...  This show is definitely going to be part of the stuff we're running over the weekend.  In today, we had...  Obviously, Norton was in, but we also had Louis C.K. and Dave Attal, Colin Quinn... 
[03:55:30]  Jim Florentine.  Amy Schumer, Joe DeRosa, Jim Florentine, Russ Meneve...  Kurt Metzger.  Kurt Metzger.  We had Bill Burr on the phone, Joe Rogan on the phone.  Voss called in.  Bob Kelly was here.  You said Amy, right?  Amy Schumer, yeah, if I didn't mention her.  And I mean, it was an amazing thing, because it was great that we had a room full of funny 
[03:56:00]  people who were remembering Patrice, and none of them had to fake it.  Like, he meant something to everybody in this room, some more than others.  You know, you had Jim, who considered Patrice one of his best friends, Bob Kelly, who's known  him for 20 years.  And I mean, everybody in the room had worked with him a lot here in New York, and he really 
[03:56:30]  made a huge impact on them.  And I mean, you know, on everybody who he came into contact with.  I've never seen...  And we've lost some people associated with the show, but I've never seen the fans react  the way they've reacted.  I mean, people who just listened to him on the radio felt like they knew him.  And to me, I feel like that's a credit to how real he always was, how honest he always  was, that he wasn't being a character. 
[03:57:00]  He was himself when he came in here, and he spoke honestly, and he was compelling, and he  was funny.  And he was just everything that somebody in this medium, radio, or in comedy, both, strived  to be.  You know, I mean, there's nobody who didn't on some level wish that they could be at least  somewhat like Patrice.  Whether it was just the way he was able to convey his ideas, or the way he was able to 
[03:57:30]  command an audience, or whatever it was.  On some, or just the way he was able to maintain his integrity, like Louie was talking about.  I mean, it cost him some jobs, you know, it cost him in show business or whatever, but  he managed to, and Dave Attell said it too, do what he wanted to do the way he wanted to  do it.  And I mean, I think, to me anyway, I know Opie was kind of at a loss thinking, you know, 
[03:58:00]  how do we move on from this?  What do we take from this?  And I think that, you know, everybody who was in here today, and everybody who's been  in the studio can all be blessed to just, you know, feel the privilege of the fact that  you got to know this person.  And all of us who were listeners while he was on can just feel privileged to have been  there in the moment.  That, you know, we talked about it on the air that now you're going to have a lot of  people clinging on to Patrice after the fact that he's dead. 
[03:58:30]  You know what I mean?  Like, kind of finding out about him now and just, and as Louie said, there's an end to  the material.  And we all got to be in the moment when there was no end, when it was, we got to be there  with him while it was happening.  And that's, I mean, that's a privilege for a lot of us.  I thought, yeah, Eric.  Well, remember a while back, Bill Burr talked about when he did his latest special, how  once it got to Netflix, they put it on the front page and it just blew up out of nowhere. 
[03:59:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're doing the same thing because Patrice's special, Elephant in the Room, is in the front  of the comedy section on Netflix.  So it's just, you're going to see in the next week or two, this shit just blow up even bigger.  But that's, I mean, and that tends to happen when people pass on, unfortunately.  You know, the news picks up on it and everybody feels like, you know, they have to jump on  board because they've missed out on something while it was here.  And I mean, to me, seeing as much attention as he's gotten in the media, first for getting 
[03:59:30]  sick and now for passing on, I mean, it's a double-edged sword because it's awesome to  see that he's getting this kind of attention and that he's touched this many people and  that you have, you know, we talked about at the beginning of the show, all kinds of people  talking about him on Twitter and Charlie Sheen is tweeting and Russell Simmons is tweeting  and that he made this kind of impact on this many people.  But it drives you crazy that he didn't have that kind of attention from those people when 
[04:00:00]  he was still with us.  Like, where was all this coverage when he was still here?  And, you know, it's tough because you kind of, you try to focus on the positive, but it's  not always that easy.  I want to, I don't know where Eric went.  Tell Eric to come back because I want to play some stuff for the people.  It can't just be me talking about Patrice.  I'll talk about Steven Singer.  Argentium, folks.

[04:01:30]  Okay, okay.  Good, good.  We're compiling a special.  We're going to run it all weekend.  It's going to be all Patrice.  Like Eric said a minute ago, we're going to also factor in some of the remembrance stuff  that we did today.  I mean, today, to have the stories that we heard about Patrice today from, you know, these  amazing comedians was something that, yeah, we'll rerun over the weekend.  But we're going to have a ton of Patrice material going on all weekend here on the virus. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony channel.  And so, you know, I don't know.  I think right now we're still working out exactly how long the special is going to be, what times  it's going to be on.  But for most of the weekend, if not all.  Look, you don't need, you the listener, don't need to worry about that.  There'll be plenty of Patrice material to go around.  The focus is going to be on that this weekend, so it's going to be something great to listen  to and a great way to remember.  We talked about some of our favorite Patrice moments from ONA, and that's what it'll be 
[04:02:30]  all weekend.  You know, our favorite, your favorite Patrice moments that have happened.  And it's going to be a long special because there's a lot of them.  It's going to be a tough editing process to go through.  But some of the stuff we talked about on the show today included Rock Coat, which, I mean,  everybody remembers Rock Coat.  Rock Coat is almost, you remember where you were the first time you heard Rock Coat from  Patrice.  You know, I don't want to rehash the stuff that we played on the show today. 
[04:03:00]  We played a little bit of It's Raining Stuff, another classic.  I mean, his appearance.  And Eric, you talked about his special, putting him over the top, possibly on Netflix.  One of the first things that really turned him into, like, an internet star was the Fox  News appearance that we played on the show today, where he was doing the very vulgar  stuff, especially for Fox News.  That, I mean, he exposed him to a whole new audience because the video just got passed around  everywhere.  But what I wanted to play was Rock Coat, because we didn't play that on the air today. 
[04:03:30]  And I thought it would be a fitting thing to do, being that, you know, we're kind of trying  to celebrate the life of Patrice.  Tomorrow, we're going to have Dane Cook on the show.  Yes.  We might have some other guests coming in as well.  Yeah, we're going to, I mean, it's not, this Patrice thing is not something that we're  going to be able to talk about for a day and just kind of put in our back pocket and move  on with business as usual.  It's going to be something that keeps moving.  So, yeah, Dane Cook's going to be on tomorrow.  And Dane also started in comedy at the same time as Patrice. 
[04:04:00]  So, it'll be great to hear his perspective on everything.  And we're talking to other comedians about who wants to come in and kind of, you know,  talk about it and just remember him.  So, remember him with us right now.  This is Patrice and Rock Coat on After Open Anthony Live.  I think you got to plan where your room is.  You want your room at the back of the ship, right?  Buy the bitch a Rock Coat from Jamaica.  This is the new Rock Coat, man. 
[04:04:30]  It's made of stone.  It's made of stone.  Zip the Rock Coat and throw her over.  He throw this Rock Coat on, man.  You want to buy a beautiful Rock Coat?  We'll braid her hair with some big stones.  This is a big stone, man, yo.  Get down.  Did you get her the stone flip-flops, too, man? 
[04:05:00]  Some fucking Jamaican knows the deal.  Here's the Rock Coat.  Here's the song that's playing as you're heave-hoeing.  All right.  People dancing on the upper deck.  You bump the bitch on right in the conga line.  Come on, everybody.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Woo!  Come on one more time around the promenade.  Oh, God.  Sink like a rock, rock, rock. 
[04:05:30]  We're the Rock, Rock Coat.  Come on, everybody.  All right.  I'm going to try this.  So this is what's going on on the deck.  Right.  You do the heave-ho.  Yeah.  Big, do you have a splash, Anthony?  Oh, God.  You're getting ready for the heave-ho, and everyone's having a good time upstairs.  Hold on.  So then you do the heave-ho.  First, you've got to get rid of her. 
[04:06:00]  Crack her on the head.  All right.  You knocked her on the head.  But she's complaining.  Then the splash.  Oh, that was a splash?  Yeah.  You got it.  All right.  Here we go.  That's what she hears.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  That's the fucking boat.  Oh, I found a friend. 
[04:06:30]  He's genius stuff.  The great Ron Bennington, of course.  You can tell by the music, has joined us on After Open Anthony Live.  Was the genius stuff for me, or?  Yeah.  Sure, sure.  Yeah, you.  Genius stuff.  Wow.  Wow.  You guys did a great job with the callers yesterday and the Patrice stuff.  Was it weird that it broke on Twitter while you guys were doing a show?  Yeah, of course it was.  And then, like, you know, that awful thing of, you know, now, how do you just say something 
[04:07:00]  about the dude?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, what, are you just going to make one remark and then move on with your show?  Right.  Like, what else?  Okay, now, yeah, now let's move on.  Fez, I understand that you.  But, uh, I mean, it was good to, you gave the people a voice, because obviously we did  a different thing today with all the comedians.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Phenomenal stuff today, though.  It was amazing.  That's what I said.  I mean, just to hear all those guys in a room together all just talking about how much  they love the guy, Patrice. 
[04:07:30]  It was an amazing thing to think about, you know, all the different people that he touched.  I just, I keep thinking what if Louis C.K. would have taken him for a walk?  That's the one thing that bothers me.  You know what I mean?  That would have been, maybe we wouldn't have had to do this.  If Louis had just gone over and said, hey.  Maybe if he wasn't so caught up in his own career.  Yeah.  You know, does he have to produce and edit and direct?  You couldn't have gone over.  Maybe, hey, you know, you could do so many stuff.  What about throwing a step class?  Is that so difficult?  Why not? 
[04:08:00]  At least some yoga or something.  I'm going to keep this going today, and today I will only have black guests on my show.  Oh, that's good.  That's good, because Patrice would have wanted it that way.  The phenomenal thing is, do you think Patrice even had the slightest idea that he would  get this kind of coverage?  No.  I think, and on some level, he would have appreciated it, but on another level, it would have really  irritated him that these people are coming out of the woodworks now.  Well, I'm doing it for him.  I'm actually pissed for him.  Now, I understand that we're going to play the Unmasked that I did with Patrice throughout 
[04:08:30]  the weekend, too.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  Last night, Raw Dog played it, as well as the foxhole.  I don't know.  The foxhole.  I just get this thing that, hey, Raw Dog's decided to play this at, like, 9 o'clock, and  so is the foxhole.  But now we're at this thing of, like, that, you know, you never saw the thing, like, stuff  just gets rushed out there that had been sitting around.  Yeah.  We've got to get a press release out.  We've got to do something.  Yeah. 
[04:09:00]  Why is it on the foxhole?  What's the connection with the foxhole?  I guess because Black Comic, and they, I don't know whether they've done all that much on  Patrice themselves.  Yeah, I don't think so.  We don't have a ton of stuff in the Sirius Library in general, so I don't think that the  foxhole ever had a major connection, but I guess you're right.  Anytime there's black comedian news, the foxhole is there.  I would just like to say, you know, play that while he was alive.  Maybe a week that he had a gig would have been terrific.  Yeah, it would have been nice.  Maybe when the DVD came out, you could have thrown on the unmasked foxhole. 
[04:09:30]  I would have thought that would have been great.  It's a new audience.  No, now.  But it is, it is peculiar to see how much people are able to show appreciation after  someone passes away.  It's weird because you always see it happen, like with everybody, but when it's somebody  that you actually, like when it's somebody that you're close to or that's in your, whatever,  your circle or our world here on the Opie and Anthony channel, that it happens even  for us.  Now, I also, I brought this up yesterday very, very quickly, Opie's wedding. 
[04:10:00]  You don't think that Patrice tried to outdress the wedding party.  Yeah, you always hear like women keeping each other in check, making sure you're not  wearing white or something.  When Patrice rolled up with his hat and his pint out suit, yeah, maybe a little bit.  It was, the only thing that could have made it like more extravagant is if he came in  on a float.  You know, he was almost at that point.  And he was the only black guy in the room and the largest guy in the room.  So right there, all three things together. 
[04:10:30]  But I said to myself, is that the Riddler?  No, it's, Patrice, I thought there was going to be, you know, a robbery.  Yeah.  We wanted to close today before we started running fast.  What do you mean, thank God?  I thought we were having a good time.  A lot of times you go along, you fight with comics.  I don't fight with comics.  You fought with that one gay comic.  Oh, Andy Dink, I remember.  I didn't know he was gay.  I was talking about someone else.  I was talking about someone else.  I'm sorry, then.  I guess it's just a misunderstanding.  Like yesterday's show, I misunderstand people all the time. 
[04:11:00]  So uncomfortable.  You will never forget that, by the way.  Your whole career, that moment will haunt you.  That'll be the thing.  Will it be stuck in my head or will people just keep bringing it up?  No, it'll be stuck in your head.  Like one night, you'll be just sitting there going, oh God, yeah, that's right, I did that.  It's horrible.  You'll see something.  It's horrible.  You'll be watching some TV show about a person who lost their kid and how bad they feel,  and then you'll be like, oh, I remember I did the worst thing ever.  It was the only thing that Twitter was, comments were pouring in from Twitter yesterday saying, 
[04:11:30]  oh, sucks about Patrice, sorry about the loss, blah, blah, blah.  And then every like fifth or sixth tweet was, hope they don't forget to bust your balls about  the Adam Wallace thing.  Don't let this overshadow the Adam Wallace thing.  It was sad.  It was sad to think of you as a broadcaster and making that kind of mistake.  It upsets you that this was the future.  I guess this is why you'll never get like a network TV show because you'll be one of  those guys who'll just uncomfortably go, uh, and 9-11 was funny. 
[04:12:00]  In the weather today.  And everybody's like, what did you say?  Like, did you hear the Fox News reporter that was reporting on, not Fox News, Fox 5,  he was reporting on Patrice and he goes, Patrice O'Neal was 14 years old.  Can we, can we hear that again though, before you go on?  Uh, yeah, actually real quick.  This was on, this was on Fox 5 here in New York.  I just did a search this morning on our service for Patrice stories.  Right.  And, and this is what I come up with here in New York of all places.  Like the one, his, his home. 
[04:12:30]  Oh no, New York local news is as bad as Akron's local news.  They all stink.  It's supposed to be the number one.  Yeah, they blow.  They're just awful.  This is how, uh, Fox News, Fox 5 in New York covered it.  Sad news tonight from the entertainment world.  Comedian Patrice O'Neal has died.  O'Neal died this morning from complications from a stroke he suffered last month.  The Boston native appeared in September's Comedy Central's roast of Charlie Sheen,  where his struggle with diabetes was a punchline for many jokes.  O'Neal was a well-known presence on talk shows in the stand-up industry, 
[04:13:00]  and was a frequent guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  He was 14 years old.  He is.  That's the Sam Roberts of news right there.  Seriously, when a kid that was so much talent, just this young teenager, you know, struck down.  I mean, I guess they say black people, you can't tell when they age,  but Patrice did not look good for 14.  Uh, no, really.  Even that guy, why didn't he look at them and go, this couldn't be right? 
[04:13:30]  Yeah, or even just like, like, a little stutter, 14.  14?  Nothing.  Stay classy, San Diego.  Yeah.  What a fucking dick.  Well, that's the only word.  What a fucking dick.  It's true.  And he's on the news.  That's his only thing is just to read the copy, and he's dyslexic.  He's...  Adam Walsh!  That is.  That's Steve Corralin.  And, uh, in Anchorman. 
[04:14:00]  You screamed out the name of a man's murdered child.  And you have the balls.  He's a newscaster!  And he's experienced.  There's another thing I want everybody to check in on local news.  There is not a local news anchor in the country that follows professional sports,  and yet they'll try to have something happen.  Oh, a little back and forth?  Yeah, a little back and forth, and it's like, well, uh, the Jets will get them, uh, on another 
[04:14:30]  game day.  You know, they're all confused.  And I'm like, you're in news.  Just follow.  Keep an eye on it.  Or at least pick up on what the, what, what, what, how you say it, what the wording is.  Like, the big match is on Sunday.  It's...  And the sports guys just look at him like, what are you, a dick?  Yeah.  And you got the male anchor and the female anchor discussing as if the, like, the female anchors  are watching too.  Whoa!  That pigskin was being thrown around.  Is there any chance Sanchez could bring other Mexicans in to help out the team? 
[04:15:00]  They all blow at that sports crossover.  We gotta let you, uh, the Ron and Fez show start.  I'm glad...  Well, what did you want to end with?  You said you went down with something.  Well, we were gonna end with the Patrice, uh, singing the blues with Warren Haynes.  I think that's a great idea.  But I'm getting in my headphones so we can't do it.  Why can't we do it?  Not enough time?  We have a guest or something?  What time is the guest?  Are we good or bad?  Either way, you're not gonna hurt my feelings.  Just do it.  We're gonna do it?  Okay.  Uh, we'll end with, uh... 
[04:15:30]  This is great, by the way.  What?  The Warren Haynes and Patrice on the L.A.?  Yeah, it was fucking amazing.  It shocked everybody.  Like, all of a sudden people just stood...  Like, they thought it was a goof.  Yeah.  And then everybody just stood back and watched.  It did not shock me because a lot of people don't know this.  Patrice used to sing blues downtown and I used to play the harmonica with him.  You did?  Yeah, I was just trying to get on the news about it right now.  There's so much going on in your life.  He was 14 years old, ladies and gentlemen.  14.  This is Patrice and Warren Haynes as we say goodbye. 
[04:16:00]  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  All right, this is a little weird.  It's gonna be Patrice O'Neal, Warren Haynes.  Man, this is all spoken.  Man, you know I've been enjoying things that kings and queens will never have.  In fact, kings and queens can never get, and they don't even know about it.  In good times, great googly moogly. 
[04:16:30]  Great googly moogly.  I have had my fun, if I never get well no more.  I have had my fun, if I never get well.  Oh, my health is fading on me. 
[04:17:00]  Oh, yeah, I'm going down slow.  Now, look at here.  I did not say I was a millionaire.  But I said I've had spent more money than a millionaire. 
[04:17:30]  Yeah, because if I had kept all my money that I'd already spent, I would have been a millionaire a long time ago.  And women, ooh, women.  Great googly moogly.  Please write my mama.  Tell her the shape I'm in. 
[04:18:00]  Tell her to pray for me.  Forgive me for my sin. 
[04:18:30]  Hey, man, that's all right.  Patrice, that's all right.  That's Hollywood.  You got to listen to Hollywood, though, man.  That's all right.  You got a voice on you, Patrice.  I'm going down slow.  You just said tell my mama I love her.  I'm out of here.  Opie and Anthony's show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[04:19:00]  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  The Monday and Fez are next.  Hey.  I'm out of here.  Hey.  I </pre>
