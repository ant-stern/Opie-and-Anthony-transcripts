<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a discussion of a mundane radio commercial, quickly transitioning into Opie's darkly humorous descriptions of his "beautiful friends"—elderly women experiencing various stages of health decline.  This segued into an amusing account of a "trout flu" outbreak impacting the show's staff.  The hosts then dissected a recurring comedic bit featuring E-Rock, focusing on his perceived lack of comedic talent and his frustrated reaction.

The show then dedicated significant time to a Minnesota Twins/Detroit Tigers baseball game, surprisingly captivating Opie despite his lack of team allegiance. This led to a comparison of the aging Metrodome to other outdated structures and speculation on the future of stadium design and which musical acts could still sell out large venues.  An extensive list of musicians was debated.  The baseball discussion concluded with a lengthy trivia segment focusing on identifying the 1970s musician who sold the concept for MTV—revealed to be Michael Nesmith of The Monkees—and a brief mention of his family's invention of Liquid Paper.

A subsequent segment delved into Major League Baseball's exclusive baseball card licensing deal, prompting frustration over the monopolistic practice and comparisons to similar deals in video game licensing.  This sparked a nostalgic discussion of childhood baseball card collecting, including descriptions of card-flipping games like "Darkie," and the intense emotional stakes involved.  The hosts, along with callers including Jason from Ohio, shared numerous anecdotes about childhood traumas and attention-seeking behaviors, including self-inflicted injuries and elaborate schemes to gain sympathy.  Callers recounted experiences like being nicknamed "Barferroni" after a bus vomiting incident and self-inflicted burns.  Vulgar and offensive language was prevalent throughout this segment.

The show continued with Opie recounting a childhood story about a lazy, hungover day camp counselor and a fabricated "Future Man" used to scare children.  This transitioned into a discussion about anger, prompted by a caller's question.  Anthony's anger, its potential roots, and the need for therapy were debated with caller Lydia, a psychiatrist, and Jimmy Norton.  The conversation explored anger's nature and whether it always indicates deeper issues.  This section also included discussion of a YouTube video showing a violent assault, Jimmy Norton's childhood attempt to break his arm, high viewership of a Brett Favre game, and a listener's "break" with his girlfriend.

A significant portion of the show focused on Led Zeppelin cover bands, particularly Great White, even considering the band's involvement in a deadly fire.  The hosts searched for and played YouTube clips, encountering technical difficulties along the way.  The discussion branched out to other artists' covers (Chris Cornell, Kiss, Johnny Cash), interspersed with listener calls, including a humorous attempt by a caller to sing "Immigrant Song."  A "Rock Jocktober" segment played clips from Connie and Fish's radio show, prompting commentary on their style.  Calls about Andy McKee and Marianne Faithfull were also included.

The final segment addressed the missing promotional sticker for Jimmy's Jay Leno appearance.  This led to a discussion of a Connie and Fish segment about body-swapping, sparking speculation about celebrities (Steven Tyler, Mick Jagger, Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt) and even pregnancy.  Mars, a fill-in co-host, participated, often comically awkwardly, interacting with the hosts with banter and insults.  Further Connie and Fish clips were played, with critique of their on-air chemistry, followed by criticism of Mars’ performance and a preview of Rich Voss, an upcoming guest. The segment was characterized by sexually explicit comments and crude jokes.  The overall tone of the entire broadcast was highly informal and liberally employed vulgar and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Aye.  I like that fake energy.  Hey, hey.  Morning.  We're here in the morning, everybody.  Another morning for you, Wednesday morning.  With some beautiful friends.  I sat at a table with four women who became beautiful friends.  Ah, I heard that commercial.  It's just our inside thing.  Love it.  No one else.  He gets it. 
[00:00:30]  A dumb commercial they're running on.  1010 wins when you drive in.  When we listen to the news in the morning, the commercial and separate cars, both.  Yeah.  Why separate cars?  Well, because it lives way over there and I live over here.  I'm over here now.  No, I'm out on the island.  And I live in the city, Jimmy.  Why don't you meet somewhere?  Talk things over on the way in.  Show prep in the car.  That was the old days.  We used to do that.  We sure did.  Yeah.  Beautiful friends.  I say goodnight to the river every night. 
[00:01:00]  And I say good morning to the river every morning.  They have wonderful lectures on politics.  I took a course on politics.  Ew.  Is that one of them?  Oh, this is.  I love this commercial.  It is the best commercial.  Like, I go between 88 and 1010 wins for the news.  And the commercial just came on and I switched over to 88.  And then I realized, oh, wait, that was the commercial. 
[00:01:30]  And I'm like frantically hitting the 1010 button to get it back on.  Because it's just a wonderful, horrid, old, bitty commercial.  I want to hear it.  Do we have it?  We've been, I don't know.  Yeah, we can find it.  Yeah.  I don't even think of, I don't know.  It doesn't matter, does it?  We play it on our show.  People are going to be like, what's the big deal, you idiots?  I still want to hear it.  No, it's just silly.  Watch the old people.  Yeah.  Some beautiful friends.  I went to dinner.  No, it was breakfast.  Breakfast. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I sat at a table with four ladies who became beautiful friends.  Did they?  What were you kvetching about that they became beautiful friends?  Let that your grandparents, grandkids don't come to visit you anymore?  One's shitting.  One is completely in the throats of dementia.  One's eating her own slipper.  Thinks it's a taco.  The other one's got to defend herself every night against the angel of death.  That's there trying to plug her nose down with a pillow.  She screams, the bearded devil is here and nobody believes her. 
[00:02:30]  As he moonwalks in with a fucking pillow with handles on it.  Because they just think she's suffering from dementia.  No, it's actually happening.  Oh, is that great?  Yeah, what beautiful friends are they?  Beautiful friends.  Of course they're beautiful.  They're always wearing their suits with their hands crossed across their chest.  They're always wearing their best.  One guy's still fighting the war.  He's rolling in his wheelchair because he's in Iwo Jima.  They have to keep the Asian orderly away from him. 
[00:03:00]  Man hides under his desk.  Older gentleman.  Those crazy old coots.  Oh my god.  I guess we'll have to find the commercial.  So we should take roll call.  Yeah, what do we got?  What do we got today as far as roll call goes?  Trout flu update.  Trout flu.  I'm officially seven days in.  Fucking this fucking thing won't let go, man.  I'm pretty snotty.  You're pretty snotty?  I do a shot of Dayquil before I come in in the morning.  Oh, that's smart.  Which is nice. 
[00:03:30]  I'm on.  I like doing shots in the morning.  It's like the old days.  Of course you do.  Anything.  Any excuse to do a shot?  Yes.  You want an espresso?  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Anything.  Please put it in a shot glass.  I'm on the other side of it, but it's still holding on, this motherfucking trout flu.  Thank you, Robert Kelly.  Yeah.  Anthony Sniffley, Bill Burr, still sick.  Now we add Danny, E-Rock, and Derek.  Oh, yeah.  T-Boy's out, too?  So we lost three other guys to the trout flu.  Wow.  Wow.  This show is just fucking getting destroyed by this trout flu. 
[00:04:00]  This is big.  The immune system kid actually has a sore throat, but I think that's from my Louis Black yesterday.  Yeah?  I was very snotty when I woke up in it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh.  I just kissed it while he did his, uh, I said, do some of your jokes.  Oh, I remember.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Right.  You were doing your impression of Louis.  I hope I can make it through tomorrow.  All I care about is one more day of a good throat.  You gotta get on Leno. 
[00:04:30]  I'll bite Bob Kelly's face.  If I'm sick and I can't do my thing, I'll bite his fat cheek.  He's in denial that he fucking brought this to everybody.  Dude, I'm not even sick.  Dude, just stop it.  It wasn't me.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got my coffee.  Boom.  I'm out.  Everybody's sick.  Bang.  I'm good.  I'm out.  I'm done.  I'm around the town.  I'm man about town.  He called me and said he was sick.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah.  So, and trout flu is trending on Twitter.  Trout flu. 
[00:05:00]  Trout flu.  There it is.  What is it?  Hashmarks, they call it?  Yeah.  If you're twittering, you just add...  Tick-tock-toe.  Hashmarks, trout flu, one word.  Yeah.  It's trending right now.  People are trying to really figure out what the trout flu is all about.  Now, I want to know...  Yeah.  ...if a young E-Rock actually has the trout flu or a case of the, I'm so embarrassed of the  virus bit...  He's not happy.  ...that I'm not coming in.  I heard he wasn't happy, so I reached out to him.  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  I was too lazy to actually pick up the phone and talk to him like a human being.  Yeah.  But I started kind of just writing to him, and he would only give me one word answers.  Oh.  One word answers.  Much like his virus character.  And then I had a punchline.  Then I had to tear down a wall.  I'm like, E-Rock, if you came up with a punchline, the bit would have sucked.  Ruins the bit.  The bit was perfect because you couldn't come up with a punchline.  Yeah.  Your natural lack of ability made that bit.  Exactly.  Your complete lack of humor is what makes it funny. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  The fact that you're devoid of wit, witticisms, or clever observations is what made us laugh.  Yeah.  Get it.  If you had a brain larger than a water buffalo, we wouldn't have enjoyed that.  You stegosaurus.  And that's...  That bit is...  I was telling Ant before the show, it's one of those bits.  You either really, really like it.  Yeah.  A lot of feedback that I got, people thought is one of the funniest things they've heard  in a long time.  But then I also got feedback from people that said it's the first time they changed a channel 
[00:06:30]  in a month and all that.  Ah, you always get that.  Very polarizing bit.  It's a very polarizing bit.  Yes.  Absolutely.  I personally think it's hilarious.  I love it.  Me too.  Because he really wants to come up with a punchline.  He does.  And he's so upset.  And the more upset he gets about it, the worse it is because he can't...  He gets so rattled and nervous.  Well, then he panics.  He panics!  He probably could come up with a punchline, but not on the spot like we put him on. 
[00:07:00]  No.  But, yeah, so E-Rock might be out because of the virus bit and not because he has the  trout show.  The actual virus.  When his virus jokes were replayed during line of the day at the end of the show, he  was in the office and he put his head in his hands and started pounding down on the desk  as hard as he could because he was pissed off.  And we have you to blame, Sam.  Why me?  We asked you to come up with a morning show character.  We told you to get E-Rock and give him a morning show character.  That was you.  And I believe that was your idea, right? 
[00:07:30]  Wow.  Yeah, I did come up with the Opie and Anthony virus, but it's a good character.  It's a terrific character.  It really is a good character.  You know?  I'll give you that much.  It's what E-Rock does with it.  Maybe we farm out the character.  Like have different markets can pick it up as long as they don't overlap.  Maybe have someone else try it for us.  Oh, you mean like that?  Maybe.  Oh, one of the interns?  I saw swivel hips running around here.  Good old Evan.  Evan would do probably a really good...  Yeah, we'll think it over.  And we're going to move into some Jacktober stuff in a little while here. 
[00:08:00]  Jacktober.  Boy, let me tell you about last night, though.  What a night I had.  What happened?  Nothing.  I was all alone.  Alone.  Sitting.  All by...  All by myself.  And it was great.  I was sitting at my own personal sports bar.  Yeah, my own bar.  And then I just turned the TV on and watched what was perhaps the saddest of all things.  No.  I watched the Twins and Tigers game. 
[00:08:30]  Two teams I could give a flying fuck about.  I'm starting to think you might like this baseball thing.  Well, I really got into it this year.  Last year was very difficult with the Yankees.  I mean, come on.  They didn't even make the playoffs.  It was just very difficult.  Oh, so you're a Fairweather fan.  I'm a Fairweather fan.  Fairweather fan.  No, people have been saying that.  The thing is, it's hard to get excited and talk about a team on a radio show when they stunk. 
[00:09:00]  Now when they're doing good, you talk about them.  It's not like I wasn't going, oh, fuck the Yankees last year or the year before or ever since fucking 2000.  But, you know, it's one of those things.  They play well.  They make the fucking playoffs.  And it's exciting.  So last night, they had that one game playoff between the Tigers and the Twins up there in Minnesota.  Where the stadium will be painted in thermite paint in order to destroy it. 
[00:09:30]  They finally get a new stadium next year?  Yeah, they're getting rid of that fucking archaic piece of shit.  You're saying it's one of those stadiums where they can turn it around and make it into a football stadium?  You saw, like, where they put grass over the Vikings logo.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It was really like, oh, God, remember those days.  And they're playing.  Like, they got to put temporary seats in to make it even look like a baseball stadium.  And it's just awful. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, that's kind of cool, though.  Yeah, it was so old school with the big blow-up roof.  Oh, that place?  Yeah, yeah.  That place is old now?  Yeah, that's old now.  I haven't thought of that place since Kirby Puckett.  Look at all.  I was just thinking of him.  Puckett.  And his bad eye.  I swear to God, I haven't.  Yeah, his bad eye.  Yeah, bad eye.  I was just thinking about Kirby Puckett.  I was going to ask how Kirby Puckett did.  No joke.  I haven't thought of that dome since Kirby Puckett.  Yeah, the dome, man.  So the dome is outdated now.  The dome is, well, depending on their series with the Yankees, the dome's pretty much done 
[00:10:30]  for that.  Wow, okay.  Yeah, it really looks archaic.  It looks so old.  And remember when it was cutting edge?  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  Well, how long ago did they build that?  I don't know when they built that thing.  But it's got that look of these old stadiums.  They used to be these, they built these giant, personality-less stadiums back then.  Just as long as they were huge and had a dome over it, it was like 28 years ago. 
[00:11:00]  That's it?  It's not that long ago.  Don't you think these places should last a little longer than 28 years?  You know, you look at Yankee Stadium.  Especially if the taxpayers are paying for it.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  They've kind of made, I think they made like, wow, we are cutting edge technology 28 years  ago without thinking maybe things will change.  See, the more you go retro, the easier it is for a stadium to last. 
[00:11:30]  Well, was Camden Yards the first one with that whole retro look?  That did the whole retro look?  Probably, right?  Probably, yeah.  So here's the deal with sports stadiums and whatnot.  As soon as someone comes up with a new idea that's better than the retro thing, then  you're going to see everyone just change their stadiums again.  But then it looks, see, it's like the TWA terminal at JFK.  Right.  That Planet of the Apes looking future thing.  And they thought when they built that, that that was what the future was going to look 
[00:12:00]  like.  So they were going to just, this thing would, you know, the future would finally catch  up with this building they built.  And it just looks stupid.  Of course.  It looks stupid for so many years.  And that's kind of what happens.  So when they go retro, especially with baseball stadiums, you can't really lose.  It's kind of like, you know, that's, that looks good.  Like the new Yankee Stadium?  Mm-hmm.  Looks great.  Looks like an old stadium.  Yeah.  It's timeless.  With all the future amenities and stuff.  What's that new stadium they're building that you just showed? 
[00:12:30]  Because that thing is fucking twisted.  That, that, I don't know.  Where is this?  Is that the new, it's the new Viking stadium.  Oh, that's the new one they're going to be building?  Oh, look at this.  Look at that fucking thing.  It looks like a spaceship.  Wow.  That's going to be trouble in a few years.  Well, of course.  I think it's going to be trouble.  Oh, shit.  The roof goes all the way down the side?  Yeah.  The roof, it's supposed to be, okay.  Yeah, they could cover it up.  They could blast it off.  In Minnesota, you have to, though.  I mean, the weather there is so shitty.  I'm going to Denver, and literally they said,  Kenny said the weather's going to be snow. 
[00:13:00]  It was October, and he goes,  yeah, they're having snow storms or like snow showers.  It's crazy.  It's Denver.  But I'm saying Minnesota's no different.  They have the same type of weather.  When I think Denver, I think snow.  I think snow almost all year long.  Yeah, summertime.  I really do.  You just think snow.  Buffalo, too.  I think snow.  Buffalo.  They got to have snow by now.  Buffalo.  Anyone in Buffalo, give us a call.  Are they starting with that lake effect shit yet?  Buffalo scares me.  Buffalo.  Oh, Buffalo.  Oh, well, so two teams I could really give a fuck about. 
[00:13:30]  Let me ask you a question before you start.  Yes.  Were you rooting for, normally you have one team that you're like,  I'd kind of like to see this one when you have no loyalty either way.  I didn't care at all who won that fucking game, but it was a great game to watch.  The thing went 12 innings, back and forth, just when you think the Tigers had it all wrapped  up, the Twins come back, tie the game, and then the Tigers go up. 
[00:14:00]  Finally, it was a 6-5.  No, no, when they were ahead and they came back and tied.  Oh, like, what was it?  3-3, and then it was 4-3, and then 5-4.  It was close the whole time, right?  Yeah, close the whole time.  And, you know, they start running out of pitchers and shit like that.  They used eight pitchers?  Yeah.  So then I started thinking, all right, I kind of wanted to see the Twins win more than Detroit.  Although I wanted to see Detroit go the whole distance, win the World Series just to watch 
[00:14:30]  it burn.  Oh, do those Detroit fans know how to party?  They sure do know how to party.  Just a gas can and a fucking lighter.  Yeah, the big D on it.  Oh, they love it.  One turned over car.  Yes.  And you got a barbecue.  So when the Twins finally won it, yeah, that was kind of cool.  I dug that, but it was just a great game to watch.  Yeah, everyone's saying it was a great baseball game.  I didn't give a shit about those two teams, but I was really, like, into watching the game. 
[00:15:00]  And now they come to New York.  Well, they just flew in three hours ago.  They pretty much, look, I think I went to bed right after the game.  Yeah.  I'm fucking exhausted right now.  They flew into New York.  Partied a little bit because they want it.  And now they got to play the Yankees.  Today, right?  Resting.  Yeah.  They played tonight at like six o'clock.  Wow.  How are they going to have a flight leave in Minnesota at that hour?  Usually at that hour.  No, it's impossible. 
[00:15:30]  They're all trying to buy for tickets.  I know.  You wait here.  Pitcher's on standby.  Who are we going to play?  Yeah, who's playing tonight?  I do believe, what is it, there's zero and seven against the Yankees?  It's a bad sign.  Yeah, the Yankees swept in this year.  Is that bad?  Very, because they do.  They're all professional teams.  That's the thing is, it's like once the playoffs start, you get these motherfucking Cinderella  stories that get you a little nervous.  I have all the faith in the world in the Yankees as far as this goes, but it's one of those situations 
[00:16:00]  where like everyone is expecting the Yankees to just destroy them.  And, you know, now you got the underdog, the little team that could kind of a thing.  And that's what gets you a little, a little nervous.  Go Twins.  Just going to have to watch.  Go Twins.  Thank you, Opie.  Go Twins.  Thank you, Opie.  You're hearing it here first.  Thank you.  Twins.  Oh, that's great.  Twins.  I wanted to hear that from you.  Yes, I'm for the underdog.  Oh, now I'm into this series.  Yep. 
[00:16:30]  Go Twins.  And we get to see if A-Rod can do anything this October.  What did the front page of the paper say today?  That he's, um...  Give me the Daily News over there.  Please.  I'm going to have more about Kate Hudson.  Put that down.  Boy, does that guy have a charmed life.  Banging Kate Hudson.  Like Kate Hudson.  He's a Yankee.  I wouldn't want to bang Kate Hudson.  Making a bunch of fucking money.  Not now, after, you know, he's been in there.  Front page of the Daily News.  A $1.5 billion home. 
[00:17:00]  A $200 million team.  Now, guys, it's time to deliver.  For all the money.  All right, we get it.  The Yankees make a lot of money.  They have a lot of money to spend on players.  Shut up.  Quit your whining.  And what did Dirk Tieter say?  We want to win this one for George Steinbrenner.  One more for George.  I think George is making beautiful friends in a home somewhere.  He's saying hello to the river every morning.  I say good morning to the river. 
[00:17:30]  He thought the twins were the Yankees because he's so striped on their uniform.  That idiot.  Go team.  Oh, the boss.  The poor old boss.  Is he doddering right now?  Oh, boy, is he.  Oof.  This is just about it for the big guy.  The kids are in charge.  You haven't seen the guy in how long, you know?  A week.  The guy hasn't even seen it.  It's got to be a good week.  When was the last time they paraded Steinbrenner out?  Georgie Boyd.  I don't know.  You know.  He showed his face a couple times this year, right? 
[00:18:00]  I don't know.  The team fucking clinches.  He was at a game in Tampa.  He wasn't there.  Yeah, but he sits there.  He's like.  I don't think he leaves Tampa.  His face is all.  Is he completely incoherent or is he just.  And he's not even that old.  They're hiding him pretty well.  Yeah.  How old is he?  He's not even that old.  He was 38 years old.  I thought he was old as me.  No, he's 38.  A literal gym.  Let's go to Richard.  Was he four when he bought the Yankees?  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  How could you do that when you're four?  He went, me want Yankee. 
[00:18:30]  Let's go to Richard in Buffalo.  I want to find out about this.  That's who he said it to.  Richard.  Yeah, go ahead.  Oh.  Yes.  Yeah.  Richard.  Yes.  Yes, sir.  You're on the air.  Oh, yeah.  No, they were talking next Tuesday.  The lake effect snow was supposed to start.  Oh, okay.  They.  I love when they say they.  That's coming in a lot, Ant.  It's going to start snowing next Tuesday in Buffalo.  How do they know?  Buffalo's one of those rare places. 
[00:19:00]  They do know when it's going to snow because of that dumb lake effect crap.  Really?  If the temperature drops and the wind is just right, well, there you go.  Swoops up the water and dumps it as snow onto the city.  All righty.  He doesn't know.  All righty.  He doesn't know who to talk to.  When to talk to.  All righty.  Example of awful caller right there.  Awful.  And Steinbrenner is 79.  That's not that old.  Born on the 4th of July, 1930.  He's a Yankee doodle boy. 
[00:19:30]  He certainly is.  So was Ron Kovacs.  Really?  Remember that?  No.  Born on the 4th of July.  Oh, that guy.  The soldier.  Right.  Of course.  Yes.  The Tom Cruise character?  My favorite thing Tom Cruise ever did.  Yeah.  That's a great movie.  I was willing to follow.  They're spitting each other's faces.  Oh, yeah.  Has their wheelchair seen.  Josh, the trucker.  What's up?  Hey there, Josh.  Hey, guys.  Hey, uh.  I was just saying that the reason that they're going to get us a new stadium is with the fact  that we can only put like 55,000 people in there. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, they're just throwing money away.  Do you really need more than 55,000 people to watch a baseball game?  It looked like a fuck of a lot of people in there.  I think it was a record.  Yeah, it was that cap.  Hey, did you see that play that should have tied the game?  Which one?  Wait a minute.  I saw the whole game.  In the 12th inning, we threw a guy, walked him on base on purpose and made the bases loaded.  Yeah.  Then when the next guy came on, the ump didn't catch it. 
[00:20:30]  But on the digital replay at high def, you can see a wild pitch grazed his jersey.  Oh, yeah.  His jersey puffed out.  Oh, really?  Like the belly of his jersey kind of puffed out.  And the ball went poof.  But I think, you know what it was?  I think the ump was making up for the one that hit that guy's cuff.  And how about one where the ump called it a strike and the digital shot showed that it was eight inches outside  There was everything that was baseball in that. 
[00:21:00]  Some bad fucking calls from the umps.  Some errors.  Some really heroic catches.  Some awful, you know, trying to be a heroic catch where maybe you should have just blocked the ball and it wouldn't have been a triple kind of a thing.  Like it was, it was, uh...  Oh, when he died for it and it bounced up behind him?  Yeah, it went behind him and, uh, yeah.  Yeah, it just...  And when Williams threw the ball to third base instead of second for the double play. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was just, it was a really good fucking baseball game.  Between two teams, like I said, I could give a fuck.  I would never watch a Twins-Tigers game ever.  Right.  And I had it on just going like, holy fuck, this is a great game.  That's awesome.  Do you think baseball could be the first sport that, because of technology, could run itself?  Wow.  Run itself?  Run itself.  You mean like no players?  No, no, no.  I mean, no like umpires and whatnot. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, oh.  You think baseball is the one sport that could just about do it with technology?  Well, it is pretty cool when they have that strike zone shot and you could see, you know, where the ball ended up.  They have the little square or the cube.  You could have a machine call the balls and strikes, more or less.  Pretty much could at this point, I think, yeah.  And then with the bases, you could like put some technology.  Sensors.  Sensors in there.  Sensors in the ball.  Sensors in the ball.  Yeah.  What would you need an umpire for?  That's it. 
[00:22:30]  But that's.  Sensors in the glove.  In the glove.  Sensors in the ball.  Sensors on the bases.  And it makes a different sound if the ball hits the ground first.  But if it hits the mitt before it hits the ground, you know.  Yeah.  I think they could do it.  Foul and fair.  Sometimes it's right on the line.  They should do that as a goof.  Just like.  Like in the preseason.  No umps.  Play a game with no umps.  And see how it turns out.  See how it turns out.  Wow.  That would be something.  The honor system.  The honor system.  Right.  I don't know.  People kind of like.  Right. 
[00:23:00]  Like the umps that yell strike like that.  They just point.  What?  Steve Reich.  You know how annoyed they'd be a phone guy?  Steve Reich.  And he pointed his pointer finger in the air.  That was.  Bugs Bunny.  Oh it was.  Yeah.  Naked gun.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Leslie Nielsen did that.  Drive.  He just kept going.  Steve in Minneapolis.  Hey good morning.  Hey.  Hello.  I want to share with you guys. 
[00:23:30]  The reason why our Metrodome is kind of a generic thing.  When they built it back in the 80s.  Is that we had to share it with everybody.  Not only the Minnesota Twins.  But the Minnesota Vikings.  And then the Minnesota Gophers college team as well.  Gophers.  And now that the Twins got their own stadium.  And the Gophers has their own stadium.  They're going to take and switch that Vikings.  Turn it around and make it more of a Vikings stadium home.  They even sold the rights to the field now.  You see that it's the Mall of America field.  Mall of America field. 
[00:24:00]  They're selling the rights to everything.  You can't even listen to a baseball game.  Everything is sponsored.  Every single pitch is sponsored.  Everything.  Yeah.  You're right.  It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable.  Everything is sponsored.  And why does every team need their own stadium?  The AT&T call to the bullpen.  Let's go to the bullpen.  Now the Twins have their own outdoor stadium.  Can you imagine them playing this game or even future games in the World Series in late October outside in Minnesota? 
[00:24:30]  See that's the problem.  So why didn't you guys do a stadium with some kind of dome again?  But that was the big complaint is that the dome was providing not a more real baseball stadium in July.  Well, why not one of those roofs that you could...  The rolling roof.  The retractables?  Yeah, the retractables.  Yeah, they were actually saying that the heat that builds up with that many people in there in the dome stadium affects the flight of the ball.  Really?  Yeah.  Like you could get the ball going further in the warmer air than you can in colder air. 
[00:25:00]  That makes sense.  It's fucked up.  Physics.  I don't know.  Physics!  Physics!  Science!  These stadiums that are built for football teams amaze me.  Like they're building what?  A new giant stadium?  Yeah.  They only use it eight times a year.  Yeah.  A massive, over-the-top, multi-million dollar, million dollar.  Some of these places are pushing toward a billion.  Yeah.  A fucking stadium.  For eight games. 
[00:25:30]  You know what it is, though?  They're making these stadiums kind of like malls.  There's stores in there.  I don't know.  Are they also open when it's not even...  Like Yankee Stadium's got the museum in there and restaurants and stuff.  Is that shit going to be open during the off-season?  Well, I bet you that will be the new trend.  If the Yankees don't do it, that's the way to go with all this stuff.  Absolutely.  If you're a huge sports fan, you're like, hey, why don't we go grab dinner at the stadium? 
[00:26:00]  At the stadium.  You go in there, yeah.  You check it out a little bit.  Restaurant.  You do a little shopping.  Maybe stay in a hotel room.  In the stadium?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's probably the way to go.  It's smart because we all go to malls on weekends.  Why wouldn't you go to your favorite sports stadium?  Yeah.  Buy some stuff.  That's a way to make money in the off-season for these places.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know what they got planned, but that would be real smart.  I think that's what they're doing with a lot of these stadiums, though.  They're putting so many stores in there and everything.  Yeah.  I was amazed when I went to Yankee Stadium that, you know...  Is it nice? 
[00:26:30]  That restaurant looks really nice.  A little steak place in there.  Oh, what's it called?  It's very nice.  What baseball theme name does it have?  Homer's.  Homer's.  Or is it, you know, third base is steak.  How about just fucking...  You don't like the baseball things and everything?  No, it's fucking awful.  What is the name of that joint in there?  Let's go to Strike 3.  What's that?  That's the steak place.  Why don't they just call it fucking Bill's Steak?  Strike 3. 
[00:27:00]  Ted's Steak Emporium?  Anything but fucking...  That's what I'm getting here.  Of course.  Ted's Steak Emporium.  We have Steak Emporium's one minute.  Ding, ding, coming up.  Steak Emporium's.  It's called NYY Steak.  NYY.  NYY.  New York Yankees.  Oh.  NYY Steak.  That's not that...  That's very uncomfortable to say, though.  You know what?  They also say...  Their slogan with the steaks is,  These aren't grill marks.  They're pinstripes.  I'm not kidding. 
[00:27:30]  It's not a joke.  That made my teeth itch.  Yeah.  They are grill marks.  It's not a joke.  They said that.  They're not pinstripes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let it be noted.  Yeah, of course, Giants Stadium.  The Jets are going to play there, too.  So, yeah, 16 days a year,  the stadium will be used.  And then maybe...  You know, and it's also being used  by U2 and the Rolling Stones,  and that's it.  Yeah, it's because no other band...  U2 and the Rolling Stones.  They're basically building a stadium  for U2, the Rolling Stones,  the Giants, and the Jets.  Because what other band  could actually sell out 
[00:28:00]  that fucking place?  It really is true, man.  Because a lot of people go,  Oh, no, they use it for concerts.  Not really.  No.  I mean, I think there's maybe...  Okay, Bruce.  Bruce would fill it up.  Billy Joel.  If he's still performing.  Billy Joel and Elton could do pretty good.  There's less than 10...  Bon Jovi.  Bon Jovi.  Yeah.  Bon Jovi fill it up?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jersey.  Jersey.  Multiple times.  All right.  All right.  Maybe not in Minnesota,  but he would fill it up in...  Yeah.  All right.  How many seats is that place?  I'd be three or four hundred.  Well, when I went...  Pops rape!  Jesus. 
[00:28:30]  When I saw U2 about a week or so ago,  88,000 people were there.  88,000 people to see U2.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  It was just ridiculous.  For a football game,  I'm not really sure.  I would guess what?  75,000 maybe?  78.  78,000 for a football game?  What about the Asbury Jukes?  You think they'd fill that up?  Oh, fucking the poor man's Bruce.  I don't think so.  They used to call him the poor man's Bruce. 
[00:29:00]  I think they'd be blocking off some seats for that show.  Yeah.  Southside.  Southside Johnny.  Southside Johnny.  Let's see.  Here's a list.  Madonna?  You think Madonna fills it up?  88,000.  Let me see.  Madonna and...  Probably not anymore.  Not 88,000.  The Who used to.  I saw the Who there.  This place was packed.  That was back in, I believe, 80-something.  All right.  Let's go down the list.  Madonna, no.  The Jacksons, of course not.  The Eagles...  Michael.  Michael could have filled it, yes.  But I'm saying now...  On the 50-yard line.  We're talking we got the new stadium being done. 
[00:29:30]  I'm talking now with dead Michael right there on the 50s.  Oh, okay.  You're right about that.  Yeah, packed.  Madonna, I don't think, gets it done anymore.  No.  The Eagles probably would get it done.  Cheap trick.  You two would get it done.  The Who?  We're sick of their...  No, the Who, I don't think, could fill that up anymore.  Love the Who, but I mean,  they said goodbye to us way too many times.  We're not buying it anymore.  Could Van Halen do it?  Rolling Stones.  Going down the list here.  Rolling Stones, yes.  Pink Floyd.  Floyd?  You know something?  I might have to give it to him. 
[00:30:00]  What are we talking?  One night, Floyd fills up giant stadiums.  Are we talking five nights?  80,000 people.  80,000 people.  Because he gets some people on the field, too.  That's a tough one.  Yeah.  Bon Jovi, definitely.  ACDC, definitely.  Yes, he just did it.  Paul McCartney, 80,000 for Paul McCartney.  I think so, dude.  If you say definitely to ACDC and not to Paul McCartney,  that's a little weird.  He's talking a Beatle.  You're talking a Beatle.  All right, Paul McCartney does the job.  And not, you know, Ringo. 
[00:30:30]  The Cure, no way.  The Grateful Dead, no way.  No, not anymore.  David Bowie, no.  David Bowie, no.  Dave Matthews, man.  Dave Matthews would do it.  Play giant stadium still, though?  Yeah.  Dave Matthews would do it.  Where have they been lately?  I don't know.  Doing something gay, I'm sure.  There's a big one out on that list, too.  The Police, no.  You don't think so?  Nope.  I think, nope.  They had a really successful comeback tour, but.  You don't think?  I don't know.  All right, that's on the fence.  Depeche Mode, no.  Metallica, of course. 
[00:31:00]  Yes.  Could they fill giant stadium?  I don't know.  Metallica?  Metallica.  88,000 people?  Three nights.  They fucking fill each night, I bet.  No.  I think they were doing the Prudential Center.  Book it.  20,000.  What?  They were?  Yeah, I think they're like, I mean, they could probably do more than 20,000.  I don't think they could do 88,000.  No.  I don't know.  Billy Joel, no.  Not anymore.  I don't think he's, he's patting at 80,000.  Radiohead, no.  Elton John, no.  Genesis, no.  Elton, no, yeah.  Genesis, Phil Collins has some major problems. 
[00:31:30]  He can't drum anymore.  Why?  He has like some fucked up vertebrae or something.  Oh, yeah.  He's in a lot of pain.  He lost his arms.  Aerosmith, of course not.  Guns N' Roses, of course not.  Boston, that's not even in the cards anymore.  And Green Day, no.  And all those bands played Giant Stadium in the past.  Here's one that could definitely fill it.  Jimmy Buffett.  Jimmy Buffett would fill it.  Without a doubt, he'd fill it.  Yeah.  Blake Snake is suggesting perhaps Greg Kin could fill that up.  I want to hear the breakup song. 
[00:32:00]  Greg Kin.  What's that?  Everything had Kin.  Did everything have Kin?  Kin-Tinued.  Kin-Tinued.  Could you give me a little bio on Greg Kin?  I don't even know what it is.  All of his albums are like Kin something.  Ew.  Yeah, this will drive Jimmy nuts.  K-I-N, because it's Nick Greg Kin.  I got it.  Do you get it?  Yeah.  It's horrendous.  Here's Greg Kin.  Yeah.  It's not like a message in a bottle.  Kinspiracy.  Hey, for our black listeners, Jay-Z, Phil's Giant Stadium. 
[00:32:30]  What do you think?  What do you think, Sambo?  Sam, you're our resident black expert.  Well, Hot 97 always does summer jam in Giant Stadium.  But.  And they.  I mean, it depends.  I don't know if Jay-Z could fill it up on his own.  But if he were part of a bigger festival type deal.  Yeah.  Well, we're not talking festivals, okay?  All right.  97 does a festival in Giant Stadium every day?  Yeah.  Wow.  Thank you, not Danny.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Hey, sober guy. 
[00:33:00]  People suggest that Donnie Iris packs the place out.  Oh, good old Donnie Iris.  Donnie Iris.  The rock.  The rock.  Where's the Greg Kin bio?  Look at all these albums he did.  His song is good.  Greg Kin Band.  All right.  He started with the Greg Kin Band.  Yeah.  And then it was Greg Kin again, Jimmy.  And then he did Next of Kin.  Next of Kin.  Ew.  It's K-I-H-N is the way he spells the name.  And then he did Rock Kin Roll.  And then he did.  With the Kin in it? 
[00:33:30]  Yes.  Then he did Kin Kin to you.  All right.  Then he did Kinspiracy.  And then he's.  Kintay.  That's just tasteless.  He's Kintay.  He did Kintay just.  And then he did Citizen Kin.  Yes.  And then he writes Love and Rock and Roll.  He was sick of the Kin thing.  What happened?  Well, after Citizen Kin.  Citizen Kin bombed.  Well, Citizen Kin was a reach for the Kin thing.  It's like he ran out of Kin stuff.  Yeah.  That guy stinks.  Mexican.  J.R. from Connecticut saying Metallica can't fill the stadium anymore. 
[00:34:00]  No.  I don't think so.  Not to knock them.  It's just.  Why not, J.R.?  Why not?  I say yeah.  Yeah.  Last time I was.  What?  Tattoo the Earth a few years ago.  And that shit was lame.  They sold three shows out in Newark.  They.  Well, I don't know about that, man.  I'm just saying.  I was at Tattoo the Earth.  And it was Metallica and Slayer.  I mean, fuck the rest of the crap that they played with.  But they didn't sell out the stadium.  And it was Slayer and Metallica.  Yeah.  I don't think they could sell that out. 
[00:34:30]  Because they did.  Metallica did three nights in the new where the Devils play.  Yeah.  And one of them was Super Bowl Sunday.  And they fucking sold it out.  Jesus.  On Super Bowl Sunday.  That's very cool.  That's a lot of tickets.  Well, metalheads don't like football.  So that's easy.  Yeah.  They're doing two shows at the Garden in November.  And they're both sold out.  Yeah.  But that's only what?  That's $30,000 a night.  This is a good one.  Album cover is a melting brain.  And call it Ted Kennedy.  Oh. 
[00:35:00]  I think we were generous with our list of bands that could play Giant Stadium.  Colt is Colt Six suggesting perhaps Ratgut.  Could pack that place out.  Ratgut would be definite.  Oh, yeah.  A definite sellout.  No.  The bathroom.  All right.  They play college games there as well.  But most, I mean, you get the point.  These stadiums are really a waste of money in the end.  They're big.  Because they're built really for the football team. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  That other stuff is just to make it look kind of like they're using the place.  Oh, this guy's father-in-law played with Greg Kinn.  Get out of town.  Look at this.  David and PA.  David.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Yeah.  Your father-in-law played with Greg Kinn?  No.  My brother-in-law.  He played guitar for Jimmy.  His name was Jimmy Lyon.  He played for Eddie Money.  Tina Turner.  Yeah.  Greg Kinn.  Did he play with Greg Kinn during the banner years of Continued? 
[00:36:00]  Yes, he did.  Oh, he did, huh?  What was his name?  His name was Jimmy Lyon.  Or Jim Lyon.  He goes by on the album.  Yeah.  We all know where Eddie put all his money, right?  He what?  We all know where Eddie Money put all his money at, right?  Oh, what?  Up his nose?  Up his nose.  But Greg Kinn was a dick.  That guy, he had his own DJ show out there in San Francisco Bay Area for KS Jail back in  the late 80s, early 90s. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, he moved on and, yeah, became a radio guy.  That's right.  Who, Greg Kinn?  Yeah, yeah.  This is true.  He was DJing for a couple years.  Is he living?  Yeah, he is.  He's not even that old.  He's a NGO in San Francisco at 92.3 FM.  Right.  Wow.  Didn't know that.  He had a lot of video.  He was in that phase where you didn't have to be all that good, but he made a lot of music  videos, and they were on MTV a lot.  Yeah, it kind of reminded me of David Lee Roth.  Hey, you know who came up with the concept for MTV? 
[00:37:00]  I do, actually.  Oh.  Thank you, David.  Who?  Who?  Do you know?  Who?  When I needed you.  Wait, let me guess.  Is he a known name?  Oh, yeah.  That's a big shark.  Oh, yeah.  What's he do for a living?  He was in music.  As a singer or a producer?  And he also...  Hilo, here's your hints today. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah?  I like hints.  He was in music.  He was in music.  He was on TV a lot.  As a performer?  And he never had to work a day in his life.  There's your hints today.  As a performer?  And I guess this guy...  Dick Clark.  ...came up with a concept and sold a concept that became MTV.  Wait.  It was in music.  In music.  Didn't have to work a day in his life.  Yeah, never...  Steve Carlesi?  This guy never had to work a day in his life. 
[00:38:00]  He was filthy rich.  Oh.  Not because of what he did, by the way.  Inherited money?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  It was on TV a lot.  Motown?  No.  All right.  It was on TV a lot?  Yes.  It had to be back in the 70s.  He was on TV.  Oh, good.  Good.  All right.  All right.  In the 70s...  Was he on a show?  Good.  All right.  He was on a show in the 70s. 
[00:38:30]  Early 70s?  I know who it is.  Early 70s?  Sarah Purcell.  Fucking Sarah Purcell.  Weird Al Yankovic.  On a show.  Good, good, good, good.  70s.  Good, good, good.  1970s.  Yes.  Good.  Yes.  Tattoo. 
[00:39:00]  I have an idea for MTV.  Go ahead, sorry.  No, I'm just saying I ripped him off.  His idea to give him a dime.  He meant midget TV.  He had to lean against that sliding glass door and shoot himself.  Little fucker.  Ow.  It hurts.  Oh, poor little bastard.  Did he audio that or no?  Bled out a teaspoon of fucking blood.  Is there audio that or no?  Of what?  Him being...  Him shooting himself.  I think there is somewhere, but...  Not for the public. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, not for the public.  Yeah.  He was on the phone at the time with his check or something like that.  What do you think?  Her answering machine.  Shot himself in the chest.  Why do a pillow?  Oh, it hurts.  Oh, shit.  It's a bullet, you dummy.  Pulling a pellet gun.  Felt like a howitzer to him.  What did she do?  Huh?  She said, thank God.  I don't got to go around with this monstrosity anymore.  I don't got to act like I like him.  Maybe I can have real fingers in my vag?  Not those things? 
[00:40:00]  Can we reach the G spot?  No.  Not with his whole head.  Let's see.  70s TV show.  Singer?  Singer?  No.  Producer?  I don't know if he was a producer.  I don't know if he was a producer.  I don't know.  I don't know that much.  I don't know.  There's only so much you could read off a placemat.  I mean, come on.  Yeah.  Created the idea for MTV.  The concept.  I guess he came up with the concept that he sold it.  He sold it for a lot of money.  Don Kirshner. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  You're wrong.  Fuck.  I was looking for my belt.  That was good acting, actually.  Give yourself nothing.  Not Don Kirshner.  Dick Clark.  Was with a band that had a lot of fucking hits.  Really?  Poppy.  Ozzy?  Poppy hits.  Yay.  Poppy hits.  The guy from ABBA?  With two of them.  ABBA will never get back together.  Why?  Because the couples got divorced and they refused to play. 
[00:41:00]  And they've been offered a lot of money to do just that.  And they say never.  Who wants to hear him?  One of the biggest selling artists of all time.  Yes.  Yes.  Who can forget?  Internationally, one of the biggest selling artists of all fucking time.  Do you think they're rich?  Harmonies of ABBA.  Oh, yeah.  It was a Broadway show.  A lot of people getting it on Instant Feedback, Dan.  Come on.  I haven't been looking.  That's a lot.  This is right down your alley, this one.  You should get this one.  Poppy.  70s.  70s song.  Poppy.  Sonny Wartick.  On TV.  On TV. 
[00:41:30]  Poppy.  The Bay City Rollers.  Oh.  Donnie Marie.  Oh.  Poppy.  This is so hard.  Oh, William Frawley.  Hey, Rick.  I got an idea.  It'll be so obvious when I say it.  Will it?  Yes.  And you'll leave and get mad.  On TV in the 70s.  I think I gave you good clues.  I really did.  On TV, though.  And a musician.  That's... 
[00:42:00]  Yes.  Tony Orlando.  No.  Am I close?  Did you know this, Sam?  No, I looked it up.  Oh.  Oh, you fuck.  Bobby Darin.  No.  I'm a good guesser.  Paul Schaefer.  He was part of a band.  Part of a band.  Yes.  Now that gives it away, but...  No.  Part of a band.  70s.  TV.  Never had to work a day in his life.  Oh.  His family just filthy rich. 
[00:42:30]  Disgustingly rich.  Nelson Rockefeller.  And he made more money from MTV.  Did we give up?  No.  Yeah, I...  I know.  I'm thinking of bands in the 70s.  That were on TV.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not just once.  Like, they were on TV.  All the time.  Well, more than the average band.  Let's just put it that way.  God, these are...  The Partridge family?  All right, now you're starting to think.  Was it Shirley Jones? 
[00:43:00]  Mm-mm.  The other one.  Reuben Kincaid.  Oh.  Frank Gorshin.  Reuben Kincaid.  Marv Albers.  Oh, Danny.  A band that was on TV in the 70s.  Yeah.  All right?  Yeah.  A lot of poppy songs.  So, the Partridge family is one of those kind of bands.  All right.  It's not the Partridge family, because I don't want to hear the rest of the names.  No, no.  Was it Mike Lookenland of the Brady's?  The Brady kids.  Could you narrow in the year a little more? 
[00:43:30]  See, that's where...  That's your...  Dial in the year.  Honestly, that's your expertise.  You would know the year as it was on TV.  The show.  All right.  See...  The show.  Yeah.  The Hudson Brothers.  Oh, my God.  Are you doing this on purpose?  Wait, what show was on with a band?  I don't know.  You're panicking it.  I'm totally fucking panicking.  This is the hardest question I've ever been asked in my life.  But, man, when I give you the answer, you're going to be like, what the fuck?  I know it.  I know it.  You should at least know the band. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know the name, but it's the girl that played Abigail on the Quincy episode.  She's got a concept.  They're screaming the answer and instant feedback now.  But then again, maybe they looked it up themselves.  Yeah, because I'm not looking.  Oh, I just fucked up this.  I'm not looking down at anything.  I'm trying to...  Yeah, don't look down at it.  Don't cheat.  You're so close.  I am so close.  Were they on a variety show? 
[00:44:30]  No.  But they had their own show?  Yes.  The band had their own show?  Yes.  How do we not know this one?  Because there are only a couple that have their own show.  With Donnie Marie, they said no.  Wolfman Jack?  Midnight Special?  I'm so boggled.  I got it.  Did I hum it good?  I got it.  Huh?  I did.  Mel, tell us.  Seven million dollar man?  I just hummed the answer right in front of you. 
[00:45:00]  I'm going to have to change it slightly so you don't totally get it.  I'm trying to figure it out.  Toodly-doo.  Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute?  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  Toodly-doo.  This is so hard.  I'm losing my mind.  I hate when I can't kiss.  And we're losing listeners.  So will you hurry up?  I'm toiling over this.  How about Josie?  Not Josie from the Pussycats. 
[00:45:30]  Ah, no.  Band.  Band?  They're on TV.  Good.  I'm flipping through the channels.  Not a variety show.  Hold on.  I'm flipping through the channels.  They had their own show.  It's the 70s.  It's Little Anthony.  And I'm flipping around.  Harvey Korman.  Click, click, click, click, click.  And it's like, oh, here's a band.  They got their show.  They got hits.  They got poppy hits.  The Monkees.  They get in.  Oh.  What?  Oh.  Davey Jones. 
[00:46:00]  Peter Nesmith.  Oh.  Peter Nesmith.  I've never heard that name before.  If that's it, I'll fucking break this studio apart.  His family invented whiteout, so he never had to work a day in his life.  Oh.  Now you're onto something, but you got his name wrong.  Peter Nesmith.  No.  Michael.  Michael.  Nesmith.  It was Peter Tork.  Right.  Peter Tork.  That's easy?  Yeah.  I never heard that name.  How easy is that?  That's pretty easy.  Yeah.  Michael Nesmith of the Monkees, whose family, very good Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  I forgot that fact.  But I could swear this show was from the 60s.  Yeah.  Travis looked it up.  You really think you're fucking me on the date?  That's what fucked you up?  Yeah.  It was from 66 to 68.  If you said the 60s, I'd have had this in a second.  No.  Come on.  You can't blame me.  I swear to God.  The Monkees.  I swear to you.  What's a few years?  A few years?  The 60s or the 70s?  What if it was early 70s?  That's what I was thinking.  Well, their last album came out in 1970.  Holy shit.  Are you fucking kidding me?  All right.  I apologize for that, but Michael Nesmith came up with the concept for what would become 
[00:47:00]  MTV.  Oh, yeah.  How did he do that?  I don't know.  I didn't read any further.  He just wasted a half hour and I don't have more info on it.  He's got no more info.  Not Danny has some.  Yeah.  My name's Sam is where I'll go by.  Really?  Yeah.  Do you work here?  I do.  Yes.  For some time now.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Hey, hey, virus. 
[00:47:30]  What is it?  No, you don't want me to virus?  He produced a half hour pilot for a music video show to be called Pop Clips.  The series was never made, but Nesmith sold the rights to Time Warner, which tweaked the  idea and spawned MTV.  How much did he get for that?  I don't know.  This fucking...  You know how easy of a concept that is?  Yeah, but it was kind of being used on Don Kirsten's rock concert and the Midnight Special  and things like that.  Like, they would play...  They would have bands perform live, rarely, but usually they would just play, like, these 
[00:48:00]  filmed videos.  Right.  It wasn't even videos.  It was like these films of these bands performing, like Led Zeppelin and shit like that.  What in the...  But that's just amazing, then.  Yeah.  He came up with that.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  And yeah, his family owns, what, Liquid Paper, you said?  Yeah, yeah.  Basically, White Out and all that.  I think they called Liquid...  Wait, but didn't that crash?  I mean, fuck, who uses that anymore?  Well, I don't think they need any more money, right?  What?  They probably diversified and did other things. 
[00:48:30]  No, they probably thought, this Liquid White Out stuff is going to be used forever.  They sold it to the Klan for their dirty sheets.  Ant, they're calling you the virus today.  Why?  Coke logic.  15 minutes with no answer.  Great impression of the virus, Ant.  True.  Yeah.  Wait, if I said 70s, you would have got it?  60s.  Yeah, you did say 70s.  I mean, 60s?  60s?  A band with a TV show in the 60s?  Dude, I would have sworn that was early 70s.  I absolutely would have gotten the monkeys.  I would have sworn that was early 70s.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  You could have still guessed the monkeys.  I'd have probably either said the monkeys or the banana splits.  All right, tonight's the guy.  Banana splits had the cool six-wheel vehicle.  The banana splits.  Remember the banana splits?  Of course.  Should we take our first break?  Yeah, let's do that.  I'm exhausted now.  I'm mentally exhausted from that test.  I don't blame you.  You know what else I learned yesterday?  And I might be behind on this one.  Baseball cards.  I collected them growing up.  Me too, Gregory.  You did, right?  I loved them.  Need them.  Got them.  Need them.  Well, my favorite player of all time was here yesterday. 
[00:49:30]  Fucking very upset.  Did you hear what Major League Baseball did to the baseball companies?  Baseball card companies?  What?  Like Tops?  Like this company needs more money.  You know, they only licensed one company to make Major League Baseball cards.  Fleer?  Well, I don't know which company, to be honest.  Tops or Donruss?  Or Upper Deck.  I'm not sure which one got the...  Upper Decker.  I'm not sure which one got the contract.  Here is the weird thing.  The rest of the companies still made baseball cards, but Major League Baseball made them blur 
[00:50:00]  out the logos on every fucking card.  No way.  Remember when we were growing up, you could buy different companies.  And it was, you know...  It was only Tops.  Huh?  When I was growing up, if you didn't have Tops baseball cards, they weren't fucking baseball  cards.  It went from Tops and then it just got out of control.  Then it got out of hand.  Then there were like five, six companies at least.  Well, now there's only one company officially allowed to make the baseball cards using the  Major League Baseball logos.  I did not know that.  Wow, that is something.  Do we have a picture of a baseball card where they have to blur out everything? 
[00:50:30]  I mean, they have to blur out all the logos.  The logos on the baseball player, the logos in the stadium, everything.  It's almost a waste of time.  So these companies are basically going bankrupt because they, you know, who wants to buy baseball  cards that don't have the logo of the baseball players?  I wonder if they did that because baseball cards became such an immediate big business.  Like, they would have the special series and every year they would sell like $50 baseball.  It became like this fucking, they were just gutting people for money.  Wow.  Yeah.  Is that unbelievable?  I didn't know that. 
[00:51:00]  I read that over the weekend.  It's like, you've got to be kidding me.  I haven't bought baseball cards, obviously.  Get your Mark McGuire rookie card when he played with them.  Right.  I don't even know what teams they're on.  Don't know what teams they're on.  Here's the upper decker, Derek Jeter with the Newton.  Himmivore.  Because if you say the team, you're going to get in trouble.  I'm going to get sued and screwed here, people. 
[00:51:30]  Sued and screwed.  Sued and screwed.  Unbelievable, right?  That's sad.  Yeah, the deal hasn't started yet.  It starts next year.  So next year.  Next year.  Get them while you can, people.  Get them while you can.  Next year, there'll be one company making baseball cards.  Upper Deck says they're still going to make cards even though they can't use the team names  because they still have the...  Wait, they can't use the team names or logos?  No, they can't use the team names or logos.  They can use, since there's a players' union, they have a deal with the players' union. 
[00:52:00]  They can't use the fucking name of the team?  No, that's what I'm getting at.  This is what I read over the weekend.  I thought it started already, but it starts next year.  Can you imagine?  Wow.  Some weird shit is going on in America where there's supposedly a free market society.  Wow.  Boy, that's something.  They must have paid a hefty licensing fee then.  So how are they going to make the baseball cards?  Because I bet you Major League Baseball will get to the point where they go,  look, that looks like a Yankee uniform, so we don't even want that on your baseball card.  You know?  I like that in the commercials when they're doing a commercial that didn't want to pay the rights. 
[00:52:30]  So it's just like a Yankee and some pinstripes and there's no logo or anything.  It just has like...  Just a blue hat.  It says baseball on it.  Yeah.  Team.  It looks so bad.  It's like in the old days when they wouldn't use real sports names, like the North Dallas 40,  when they wouldn't use Dallas Cowboys or the Dallas Stars, whoever they called them,  you know, the Dallas Cornherners.  What?  So if they can't use the team names, how are they going to get baseball cards done? 
[00:53:00]  By blurring it out, I guess.  What the...  Oh, Sam's got a picture of just a guy out of his uniform?  You're going to collect baseball players out of their uniforms?  Exactly.  Fucking...  Just photos of people?  Yeah.  Now you're buying photos of people.  That's it.  How much money does a company need?  After a while, it gets...  You got to go relax.  After a while, you really just got to say relax.  They do the profile so you can't see the logo on the head.  Yeah, but I'm telling you, Major League Baseball will see this and go,  nope, that looks like a Major League Baseball uniform. 
[00:53:30]  They're going to take shots of them that are completely obscure their logos and stuff.  That's great.  How do you do them by team?  If you can't do them by team...  It's unbelievable.  What the fuck?  That shit just drives me nuts.  What about the stats on the back?  Can you put, like, he's with the Yankees or with the fucking Red Sox or something?  You could probably do that.  You could probably do, like, this New York minister.  You could probably do American League, New York.  As a consumer, you should have some good choices.  And if you want baseball cards, you should be able to choose from some solid companies that are making the cards. 
[00:54:00]  Well, the same thing goes for video games, that baseball and football have exclusive deals with video game companies.  So the only NFL-licensed video game is Madden.  Right.  So all the other video game companies can't put out an NFL-licensed game.  Yeah.  They could put them out, but they would put them out with teams that no one knows.  Well, yeah, they'll put out, like, Blitz, you know, with, like, you know, just these random players that don't mean anything.  Stupid names.  You know what?  I'm obsessed with Tiger Woods, you know, 10, and they have a lot of the golf courses in it. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  That, you know, the players actually play on, but they don't have Augusta when they play the Masters every year.  Because they couldn't get, I guess, I guess Augusta didn't sign off on it.  And supposedly they'll never sign off on it.  So you'll never see Augusta in a Tiger Woods game.  So bizarre.  How do you control that?  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Do you know, only once in my life did I collect a whole series of baseball cards.  Like, I bought a couple years after, but I never, I went through it when 1979 Tops, it's actually worth a few hundred bucks. 
[00:55:00]  But there was one card I couldn't get, Alan Bannister from the White Sox, and I finally traded my friend Neil Grant.  Neil Grant had it?  My friend Neil Grant had it.  He brought it in tinfoil.  I could not get fucking Alan Bannister.  I bought hundreds of packs.  That was fun when you were a kid.  Roger Clemens is in the box.  And now Roger Clemens is officially in here.  I used to cry to my mommy because I would lose all my cards flipping them. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, flip them.  You ever flip?  How would you flip?  Would you flip for colors?  Yeah.  Flipping for teams was really fucked up because the stack got huge.  You flip for colors, maybe five, eight cards would go by, and then the guy would top you with the color, and then he'd take the cards.  But flip for teams, now you're talking.  Well, this is going back about ten years now, so my memory's a little fuzzy.  Oh, ten years, huh?  Yeah, a little fuzzy.  No, I think we did teams.  I think we did colors.  Just to make it interesting, we came up with all sorts of ways to flip. 
[00:56:00]  And I remember the pile, like you just said, got ridiculous, and I lost everything.  It was like gambling as a kid.  Yeah, because you'd be shaking, putting that next card out, going, oh.  Because we also, because some of the kids would bring their shitty cards.  So you would look at their cards to make sure they had some solid cards in there, or you wouldn't flip with the person.  It's like, let me see what you got.  The guy would get a reputation for flipping with shit.  Right.  Remember that?  Yeah, but it was like real-life gambling, man. 
[00:56:30]  You got a Willie Mays card somewhere in there, and you're like, fuck, I might lose my fucking Willie Mays card today.  Yeah, flipping for colors was like, you know, the $5 table.  Right.  Playing at the $5 table.  Yeah, because, all right, there's three, four cards.  Yeah.  All right, I scoop that up.  Flipping for teams, though, was like you're in the high stakes fucking thing.  And it would stack up.  Stack up, and you'd be like, okay, I got all my fucking cards.  So how do you flip for teams?  I'm 12 years old, panicking.  You'd have to match the team.  Like, you know, you go, bump, bump, bump.  Yeah, one after another. 
[00:57:00]  One after the other.  A twin card comes up, and all of a sudden you flip yours, and it's a twin card, and you get it.  Yeah, you get the stack.  You get the stack that has built up.  But wait, how do you.  For colors, it was just like red, green, blue, green, green.  Oh, now you take.  Oh, whoever throws a color down, the next guy gets.  I see.  Whoever tops whatever the last guy just put down.  It was unbelievable.  My Alan Bannister card today is worth $25.  How much is the 1979?  I don't have it in mint, but how much is it worth in mint?  The 1979 Topps collection.  Sam Mint 10 condition.  He played with the white. 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to guess $550 or $600.  I don't like greed, man.  It gets ridiculous after all.  Greed is good.  Greed is good.  I understand a company that has to make money, but then it gets to a point where it's all  just greed.  Well, for all these years, they've allowed it with the other companies.  I wonder if they were just like, these guys are not good.  My argument to that whole thing, Jimmy, is that it's marketing the sport itself.  Every year when the Super Bowl comes around and they insist that radio shows and TV shows, 
[00:58:00]  no one's allowed to say Super Bowl.  That drives me nuts.  The big game is fun to say.  But you're promoting the game, and a lot of people would say, well, it doesn't need promotion.  But guess what?  All the years where radio and TV and whatnot was saying Super Bowl was promoting this thing  to what it has become today.  And to make everyone say the big game instead of the Super Bowl drives me nuts.  Well, I'll tell you why.  It does help to promote it because it gets like a fever pitch built around it. 
[00:58:30]  Because if no radio shows and no one's talking about the Super Bowl, who gives a fuck?  You're not even thinking about it.  But if everyone's leading up to it, they should be able to say the Super Bowl.  And whoever he is says it's being sold for $235.  Is that in mint condition?  The Alan Bannister car?  Jammin tan condition.  It was more than that.  Of who?  Of who?  1979 Topps.  No, you're wrong.  I was working off Anthony's fucking voice right there.  Oh, we didn't know.  Jammin tan for the entire set. 
[00:59:00]  Look, I'm going to open it up.  It's amazing who we got in here.  What do we got?  It's blum, blum, blum from the blum, blum.  My God, look, I see a young Joe Torre wearing a blum cap.  And by the way, how many people have an attic full of worthless Beanie Babies?  I'm responsible for that one.  Beanie Babies, these are going to be valuable.  How many people went into that?  Did you ever play Darkie?  What?  When we used to flip cards, we would play Darkie. 
[00:59:30]  Would you?  Yeah.  You flipped like that?  Yeah.  Well, you would just use your black baseball players.  Jesus Christ.  The piles wouldn't pile up.  Are you out of your mind?  It was one-on-one always.  So it was called Darkie.  And you mixed up your...  What racist school were you going to?  And then you flip and then you decide which card had the darker player.  Oh, no.  I've...  Only fucking Harborfields.  Look, it was...  You stuck up white trash.  Look, you were like me. 
[01:00:00]  You go play cards with your friends, right?  And after a while, just playing the basic games were boring.  So you came up with all these crazy fucking new card games.  I just flipped...  We did the same thing with flipping cards.  Flipping color, flipping teams, and then flipping players was also pretty difficult.  What's flipping players?  You had to match the player.  What?  I don't remember.  The odds of that happening were astronomical.  I don't remember that.  You'd go through hundreds of cards.  No, that's just ridiculous.  And then it was like, if nothing happened, you'd have to split them back up again.  Like, because I remember this. 
[01:00:30]  Flip for five, and then you'd start with five cards.  And you'd just flip for five.  And if no one won, you'd split them up, and then flip again.  Flip for five until somebody won.  Or flip for ten.  I'll flip you for ten.  Then you'd take ten cards.  Same thing.  Right.  I always walked away with no cards.  I lost flipping constantly.  I stunk!  I've known you for a long time.  I didn't know you collected baseball cards.  Oh, I didn't collect them.  I lost them to fucking bullies.  We used to steal them from the stationery.  We did everything we could to get our cards. 
[01:01:00]  And they had a stack of, like, last year's cards, and you'd chuck them up.  I'm going to chuck up the cards.  And people would freak out because they'd think you're throwing.  I don't know why, because every year it was the same thing.  You'd throw up your last year's cards.  Because once the new year came out, last year's cards were worthless.  Yeah.  Worthless.  That's why they're worth so much money today.  Yes.  Jim states the obvious.  Well, brother.  I would cry then sometimes, just my.  I would cry because I lost my baseball cards.  And then I'd come home like.  Brother Elmo has entire years in mint condition. 
[01:01:30]  Really?  Still in the box, that whole thing.  Yeah.  Still wrapped with the gum.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good gum.  Yeah.  He collected for a long, long time.  Tell him to give them to me.  I don't know what's going on with the cards these days, but.  We worth nothing, I bet.  Dude, they would send out cards in the same year.  Like, I think Upper Deck was doing this, and Don Rush, like, $40, like, shiny cards.  And they, like, the 80s, I think they were doing that in the 90s.  Because I had sold all my, a lot of my baseball cards to get, to drink.  To drink? 
[01:02:00]  And my cute stuff, yeah.  I sold a lot of my collectibles to drink.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially like this stuff.  Let's say hi to, this guy knows more on the blacked out baseball cards.  Jason in Ohio.  Jason.  Pleasure for me to be on today.  Hey, thank you, sir.  Hello?  Yeah, let's go.  Yes, you're on the air.  Hey, guys.  What happened was, Topps brokered this deal, because you guys were about the same age.  Collecting was just, growing up, it was just Topps, and then it became Fleer, and then Don Ross. 
[01:02:30]  And then what happened was, they overproduced the shit out of cards.  And it pushed a lot of people away.  Yep.  And Topps was trying to do this deal to get people back into collecting.  And basically, you know, they did this in the 50s with their competition, too.  And then, what the cards are going to look like from Upper Deck, they haven't said what they were.  But when this happened before with hockey, when they had the lockout in the 90s, it basically  is going to be the player's name, and he'll say, like, if it's a Yankee, he'll just say  New York right fielder. 
[01:03:00]  And it happened with Barry Bonds with, like, Fantasy Sports, where it would say San Francisco  right fielder, because he wouldn't release his rights to his name, to Major League Baseball.  Oh, shit.  I hate baseball players.  They're fucking such cunts.  They're fucking such cunts.  I fucking hate them.  So now, individually, they have to sign off on their rights?  Well, that's what Topps did, is say, we're the premier company forever, and we want the  chance to bring the hobby back.  And they're trying to get people connected back to the sport through the memorabilia business 
[01:03:30]  again.  Sure.  I get mad because I know it helps the company.  Let's just call it the company, because it happens in all walks of life.  Wow, that's not Barry Bonds, Anthony.  That doesn't look like Barry Bonds to me.  That guy's too bulky from when Barry was younger.  And the other thing that they'll probably look like, when they had the lockout with hockey  and it was a 93 or 94, they weren't making actual cards.  They had the players in the NHL PA jerseys.  Right.  So it could be like that, or the upper deck will have MLB PA players uniforms on. 
[01:04:00]  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate it, Jason.  You're welcome, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Scandal in the baseball cards.  Anthony, people are confused.  They think somebody fucked up my Willie Mays card, the famous story, because I cried a  lot over my baseball cards growing up, and I brought a, because the person is confused,  I brought a Don Larson.  Look this one up, Sam.  Oh.  The year after he pitched the perfect game, I brought that baseball card into show and  tell. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, I remember this.  Oh, no.  Tragic.  And this angry kid, I couldn't have been more than, I had to be in grammar school, man.  I think I was 10 or 11.  And the kid, I was all proud, because I had one of the coolest things at that show and  tell that day.  And this kid, he already had long hair, and he was miserable at 10.  Had a beard.  Yeah.  He's 10 or 11, and he's already miserable.  I'm like, how are you miserable at 11?  And he reaches over, grabs my card, and not in pencil, takes a pen, and just across my  whole Don Larson's card in front of everybody. 
[01:05:00]  And man, did I cry like a little fucking bitch.  Was everyone laughing at you?  They were.  They were all laughing at you.  I think they were sad for me, because I didn't know how much.  Huh?  What a dick.  He was just a fucking angry little fuck.  Because he's one of those dickheads.  I would love to know what happened to this kid.  I guaranteed.  I was probably in prison.  He killed Don Larson.  Right.  Don Larson was fingering his hand.  He couldn't take it anymore.  Every time he saw Don Larson, he went batshit.  He just lost his mind.  Yeah, that guy.  Stand with a pen, like fucking Pesci. 
[01:05:30]  He pitched a perfect game.  You think I've...  I ran out of steam.  Is that the one?  Yeah, it's a year after.  Wow.  You had that card, and he fucking drew on it?  Wait, it might be the one.  What a cock.  I always thought it was a year after.  Wait, do the other card.  Go back into the image section.  Uh-oh.  I think it might be the other one that you showed.  Do you have a lame fucking Don Larson card?  I guarantee it's worth less than fucking $100.  I think it might be that one.  It's gotta be.  It's probably some player that sounded like him.  It's Sonny Larson or some other player. 
[01:06:00]  It's Don Larson, all right.  Don Larson.  Yeah, so it's like $40, $50.  That's it.  $50.  You know what?  Worthless card.  Righteous.  But you know what?  A fine listener felt sorry for me, and I don't even know his name.  It just showed up one day in the mail.  Yeah.  A brand new fucking Don Larson card.  Maybe it was the guy.  Can you imagine if it was the guy?  He felt so guilty all these years.  Finally went to a 12-step program.  Figured out it was you on the radio. 
[01:06:30]  I was like, that's the guy.  The Don Larson card guy.  I cried like a mother fucking bitch that day.  It was bad.  I couldn't even get through the school day.  Nothing worse.  I had to go home.  I think my mommy had to pick the end.  Oh, yeah.  Nothing worse than crying at school.  With my card all just ruined by this asshole.  Look at what he did.  Right.  Mommy, look at what he did.  It's okay.  We'll get another.  It's impossible to get another.  Look, it's funny now, but when you're 11 or 12, that was my whole world, was that dumb  card. 
[01:07:00]  What else did I have?  Yeah, it was like currency.  Right.  Baseball cards were your currency in school.  We all had shit we bragged about.  That was my thing.  That's all I had.  Yeah, brought it for show and tell.  So you brought it.  What did you carry into school in?  I don't remember anymore, Jimmy.  Probably tinfoil or something.  I probably.  A plastic bag.  Probably a plastic bag.  Ziploc.  Yeah.  I mean, I didn't go crazy trying to protect these cards, but I carefully had them in a  way that wouldn't go.  Did you explain the pen marks when you showed it?  And these were just added by the gentleman here with the molesting parents. 
[01:07:30]  He did it after I showed the card, and then now we're eating fucking milk and cookies or  something.  Why did you get your card put away by that point?  Because people wanted to check it out.  They thought it was fucking cool.  I would have told them to leave their filthy hands off it.  What did the teacher do?  I don't remember, Andy.  You laughed.  My memory sucks because I was mentally abused by my mom for many decades, so I tend to forget  a lot of stuff.  Did you block things out?  Oh, yeah.  Do you think so?  Oh, yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Really creepy stuff?  No, not really.  Just a lot of yelling. 
[01:08:00]  What do you think I'd get my yelling?  Any hitting?  No, not really.  Nah.  I wouldn't spoon every once in a while.  You know.  Oh, God.  I was just weeping in school.  You were a weeper, too?  Weeping.  Just crying all the time.  What a crybaby.  Yeah.  Baby.  Baby.  Stick my head in gravy.  I just was.  God, what was wrong with me?  You're sensitive.  I thought like, no, you know what it was?  I thought I would get like sympathy.  It was a crying little student. 
[01:08:30]  I thought I would get sympathy if like I cried in school.  Yeah.  It was more like, like, obviously, it was I wasn't always that upset.  Sam is now just putting crying children up on the screen.  Go to WWW.  Oh.  Yeah.  So I thought like if I was crying, I'd get like more attention.  You're right.  People would feel sorry for me like the teacher. 
[01:09:00]  You're not a fag.  And girls.  That wasn't a way to get girls, by the way.  It was crying.  No.  No.  It's the way to not get them.  The tough guys always got them.  Of course.  The guys that made me cry were the ones.  You had your fucking Kleenex rolled up in your sleeve like a tough guy.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Boo.  Weeping.  Fucking crying over the dumbest shit.  That time I brought in those stupid fucking cookies for ethnic food day.  And what'd they call them? 
[01:09:30]  Balls of shit.  They were like these little chocolate balls.  Chocolate salty balls.  And my mother bought them because it was like you had to bring in from your background a type of food.  So I brought those in and no one ate them because they said they looked like shit balls.  And I just started crying because I felt all.  Yeah.  I felt embarrassed and then I felt bad for my mother because she bought them thinking it was a good thing and everything. 
[01:10:00]  And then I had to go home and tell her that she bought shit balls.  Do they all laugh at you?  Yeah.  Your little shit ball cookies.  They laugh and we're pointing at it.  It looks like duty.  I know it ain't my shit balls.  So I cried.  What an asshole.  Why weren't we all emotional wrecks at 11, 12?  I don't think we're. 
[01:10:30]  I think most people listening to us were emotional wrecks at 10, 11, 12, 13.  Yeah, I don't know what the fuck it was.  What the fuck was wrong with us?  Because all those hormones were trying to figure out what the fuck.  Crying.  Just raging in your body.  You ever cry in school, Jimmy?  I'm sure I did.  Yeah, I'm sure I did.  From rejection?  Yeah.  Some type of rejection.  I was a very emotional boy.  There's many emotions.  When I broke my arm, I got so much attention from having a cast on.  I can't even look at you when you tell this one.  It was great, yeah. 
[01:11:00]  So when the cast came off, I tried to break my arm again on the water fountain.  I just hit my arm on the water fountain trying to break.  So I would get another cast and people would pay attention to me because I had a cast on.  Was it a sincere, really hard bashing or no?  Was it a very lame?  Of course you could.  I couldn't commit to the break.  No, it's hard because you want to commit, but at the last second, your body kind of says no.  I couldn't do it.  It slows down the impact.  And then it hurt, so I started crying. 
[01:11:30]  Of course you did.  Fucking asshole.  I love it.  I bet you weren't kidnapped by some molester in Utah.  Oh, he'd have dumped me off.  Sure he would have.  Shut up, kid.  I had my throat slit before I was sexually assaulted just to shut me the fuck up.  God, and you just brought up a memory that I forgot about.  I punched a brick wall because my hand was healing and I was getting so much attention too.  And so my hand was healing and I wasn't ready to let go of the attention.  So I started punching the wall with my hand that was like 75% healed because I wanted to continue being in the cast. 
[01:12:00]  It's this craving attention bullshit.  That's why we ended up here, by the way.  Dude, I totally forgot about that until you just said it.  I did the exact same thing.  Yeah, same thing.  That's why we're fucking here in front of microphones at this.  It's not coincidental that we're doing this and we're all fucked up as kids trying to get attention.  It makes perfect sense now.  I was down to an ace bandage and I had a couple more doctor visits left. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  So I started punching a brick wall.  Well, like Jimmy said, this is something I blocked out until you just mentioned that story.  Yep.  And then I started punching the brick wall, but like at the last second, you can't commit.  You just can't commit.  So you're hitting, but not as hard that you need to.  That's a little bit of sanity showing its way through that you just at the last minute,  your survival instinct kicks in and says, you can't do that.  I was getting attention from girls.  They were paying attention to me a little more. 
[01:13:00]  Girls was like, they asked a lot of questions.  Right.  All that shit.  Sign the cast.  Oh, get better.  And I'd be like, look at their names and go, oh, look.  And then they cut the cast off and I'm like, now I'm just a kid with one atrophied hairy  arm.  Would you come on their names?  No, this was before Cumzies.  Yeah, I didn't either.  This was like when I was, I guess I was nine or 10, something like that.  Yeah, you tried to break your arm again.  Nine.  Yeah, I tried to break it.  They took the cast off and for like one day it was kind of like, oh, you got your cast 
[01:13:30]  off.  And I was like, yeah, yeah.  Oh, look at my arm.  It looks all funny and everything like that.  Then nobody cared.  And then no one gave a shit.  So I'm like, I went up to the water fountain and I hit it and it hurt.  So I thought maybe it was broken.  So I had to go home then and tell my mommy, I went, I ran around the corner in school  and I hit my arm on the water fountain and I think I broke it again.  And she's like, no, you didn't break it.  You tell her you hit it on the whites only sign?  Fucking creep. 
[01:14:00]  So the thing is, I kept nagging her about this fucking broken arm thing.  Ew, you kept pushing it?  I kept pushing like, I think I broke it.  Can you take me to the doctor?  What a dick.  So she actually went, all right, she took me to the doctor.  And they went to take x-rays and I'm like, hmm, there's going to be no break here.  So I actually, on the bottom of my arm, I drew in pen two lines, hoping that when it  was on the x-ray machine, it would show up as like, through the x-ray as breaks in the 
[01:14:30]  two bones, the ulna and the radius.  You tried drawing breaks on the outside?  You tried fooling the medical community?  Yeah, did I fooling the doctor with a pen mark on the bottom of my arm as I placed it  on the fucking x-ray machine?  You're psychotic.  Just so they might see it and go, wow, yeah, look at that, it's broken.  She should have taken it to the gyno.  Fucking creep.  Check out my vag.  Yuck.  Your son's arm is fine. 
[01:15:00]  His pussy's got a problem.  That's great.  And watch your arms, stupid.  You got pen marks on there.  Exactly.  He should have his fucking tear duct sewn up.  Obviously overused.  Fucking A, I love that story.  Oh, it was terrible.  Let me go to the phone.  I don't want to lose Chris in Jersey.  Chris, how are you, buddy?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to tell you that when I was a little kid in elementary school, we had something  called International Day, and we had to come in and represent our culture, our heritage,  and so I'm partly German, so my mom made me dress up in Lederhosen, food from, like, Germany 
[01:15:30]  and stuff like that.  It was really embarrassing.  Yeah, you can't make your kid dress up in...  Oh, no.  Like that.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Anthony's got a vagina.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Seems like a break his hymen on the water fan.  I know.  I know. 
[01:16:00]  Came around the corner, broke his arm.  I know.  I know.  I know.  What an asshole I was.  That pen thing, I never heard that before.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I drew the cracks in my arm, yeah.  That's terrific.  I think I actually drew them a little crackly, too, like a cartoon, like an arm would never  break.  And so what they would do is, they would take it off, and then they would just put a cast  on without any further inspection.  Yes, exactly.  And not look at the bottom.  And I'd be all happy that I'd go back to school the next day with a cast on and go, 
[01:16:30]  what happened, Anthony?  Why do you have another cast?  Well, I hit it on the water fountain.  Please give me attention.  I would hope that somebody would go, I saw you swinging it at the water fountain and take  your pen out.  Yeah, well, I was angry.  That is...  That's too good, man.  Yeah, it was really bad.  Everybody liked the way I...  They all commented on the way I swam with a cast because I was able to swim with the  one arm up, and it looked like a periscope.  And they were like, oh, look, Anthony's swimming with the cast on. 
[01:17:00]  I'm like, yes, look at me.  Me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Look at me.  What a douche I was.  Now you do the same thing, only it's in a fucking Guinness keg.  Just swimming in a Guinness keg.  Exactly.  Look at me.  Holding your glass up.  Fucking look at me, you cocksucker.  Kimmy, are you saying it's not hard to figure us out?  No.  No, we are easy.  Fucking twisted little zilchers. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, we easy.  That's hilarious.  I like the fact that the compliments, like, if someone says that was good, oh, look, you  swam with your arm up.  It was like you'd probably try to swim.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's like when somebody thinks something you say is funny, you keep trying to say it,  they're like, you don't get it.  Exactly.  It's over.  I was just...  Fuck it.  I was that guy.  We did the fucking same thing, though.  I needed...  I craved attention.  You're not all about that.  Oh, did I crave the attention.  Let's say hi to Matt in West Virginia.  Is that the Dawson crying? 
[01:18:00]  What's the Dawson crying for, dude?  Hey, Matt, what do you got?  Basically, you guys are bringing up an old story I've been trying to repress, but with  no luck.  In first grade, we were going to go on a field trip, so the teacher sent all of us to the  bathroom in our shitty little school, and we had three urinals for the boys.  And lucky me, it was the first one, and the guy behind me decided to try and piss  between my legs of that urinal, pissed all over me, and on our field trip, I had to wear  the teacher's retard blue sweatpants with my polo shirt tucked in. 
[01:18:30]  And what happened to the guy that pissed on you?  Oh, he just pretty much laughed.  He's on a radio show now with Hopi Hammond.  Very good.  Thank you, Matt.  Let's say hi to Victor in Baltimore.  Victor.  Victor.  Hey, good morning.  Hey, Victor.  I said, I'm sorry.  What's that?  I said, tell that last caller, I said, I'm sorry.  I tried to go over his shoulder, but it went between his legs.  Look at that, connecting the last caller.  I like that.  I like that.  He's always good.  I like that.  Were you the guy that peed on his pants? 
[01:19:00]  No, I peed.  Got it.  I'll do it.  I'll go further.  Hey, listen, when I was a kid in school, one of the things I tried to do is I wanted  to get out of school, so I went to the nurse, and I told her I had a fever.  She gave me a thermometer, and I rubbed it on my corduroy pants a little too long.  I said, like, 109.  109 fever.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Yeah, stupid six-year-old.  What are you going to do?  Anyway, what I wanted to say is Aunt's mom probably got charged with child abuse and 
[01:19:30]  Munchausen syndrome.  You're going to the doctor so much.  All the time, yeah.  What's your problem?  They didn't have that shit back then.  It was just called a dumb kid that craved attention.  I always had my tummy aches, too.  My stomach hurts.  Anytime there was a problem, my stomach hurts.  Oh, the car won't start.  We're stuck on the side of the road.  The car broke down.  My stomach hurts. 
[01:20:00]  Then my father would turn around and go, your stomach hurts.  Shut up.  The car's broken.  Roe, shut him the fuck up.  He was an angry man.  Of course he was.  He was right.  How do you not?  To my mother, she was a bitch on wheels back then.  Forget about it.  I can imagine Roe being a bitch.  Oh, my God.  She'd wake up on Sunday morning, and we would, it was terror.  Chore time, right?  Dude, no, no.  Not just chore time.  We had chore time.  It was terror.  Fuck, leave me alone.  I'm tired. 
[01:20:30]  Me, Dawn, and Joseph terrified of Sunday morning.  Like, you'd wake up and go, oh, my God.  When does it come?  Get the fuck out here.  Vacuum dust.  This place looks like a bomb hit it.  That's what I'm saying.  Chore time.  But it was like, get your fucking, look at it, vacuum the floor.  Don't just push the dirt around.  Sweep.  She lost her fucking mind on Sundays.  My parents didn't understand that.  Look, we need a weekend, too. 
[01:21:00]  Sorry, we're 12.  But look, we're working hard in school, and we want to relax on Saturday and Sunday.  We'd wake up, and all of a sudden, the chores would be handed out.  It wasn't so much doing the chores.  It was the way she did it.  She was fucking rabid, insane, crazy yelling that we had to clean up.  Clean up like fucking mommy dearest crazy.  You know what?  Then the phone would ring, and she'd be like, you know, can't clean up.  Jesus Christ, get this fucking prrring job.  Hey, hey, how the hell are you? 
[01:21:30]  Hey, good, no, great.  And then you'd hear happy mom and be like, oh, my God, how did she just change like that?  But she was, like, crazy.  She'd bite her hand.  She'd get mad and go, bite her own fucking hand.  Why do you, like, crazed.  Like, what the fuck?  Sane.  I used to go, then why the fuck did you have us?  I'd be, like, I'd be cowering with a rag in one hand and lemon pledge in the other,  looking over my shoulder like, just crying and rubbing wood. 
[01:22:00]  And you didn't even do anything.  No, what can I do?  It's like, just because you're having problems.  Yeah.  Don't take it out on us.  Just because you're in a world of shit.  Go back in the bedroom and figure out your problems with daddy and leave me the fuck alone.  Jesus H. Christ.  The phone's just horrific.  Dude, that fucking broken arm thing, which reminded me of mine and others have very similar stories. 
[01:22:30]  Let's go to Scott in New Hampshire.  Scott.  Yeah.  My father was in the Air Force.  I was always going to different schools all the time and made fun of because I was fat and stuff.  So I used to go in the bathroom the night before my first day, and I'd just start smashing myself in the face until I get a black eye.  And, you know, tell them I got to fight or I was tough or whatever.  And my parents were so oblivious, they wouldn't even notice in the morning that I had this huge shiner. 
[01:23:00]  So you used to try to give yourself black eyes for attention?  Well, that and I was afraid to get beat up.  So I figured I'd look tough with my black eye, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Trying to look tough.  Yeah.  When you were 12, it was a scary world out there.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got to protect yourself.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  And look at this guy, Dennis in Yonkers.  Dennis.  Hey, guys.  What's going on? 
[01:23:30]  Came from a big family.  When I was a kid, we didn't have the most money, so we had a wood-burning stove, and we were put in charge of keeping it lit and keeping the house warm.  So everybody was out, and I thought it would be a good idea for some attention to pin my arm against the hot cast iron as long as I could in order to give myself a nice burn.  It was a horrible, horrible idea, because they didn't come home for, like, another two hours, and I just sat there with a burning arm.  Oh, my God.  You idiot. 
[01:24:00]  See, this is more normal than you realize.  Yeah, attention.  Just want the attention.  That's what's great about having a radio show.  Then you realize, okay, all that sick shit you did as a kid, you're like, okay.  It was the norm.  What are you looking at?  The one you just had highlighted.  Which one?  I think John.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jesus.  Poor fuck.  John in New York, what's going on?  Hey, John.  Oh, dear friends.  I was living in Manhattan, and then we moved up to the suburbs, so I've never been on a school bus. 
[01:24:30]  Mind you, I've never been on a school bus before.  First day on a school bus.  Let me preface it by saying that we had Sunday Italian dinner the night before.  And as soon as the bus starts moving, 10 minutes later, I proceed to upchuck spaghetti and meatballs.  Oh, you know how bad puked-up spaghetti smells, too?  The entire ride, the spaghetti and the meatballs were just rolling down.  Swallowed them whole. 
[01:25:00]  Of course, of course, the kids started laughing, and then they proceeded to label me Barferroni for the next two years.  Barferroni?  Barferroni?  The worst was the pits.  How long did that...  I just cried and...  Excuse me?  How long did nickname last, Barferroni?  Oh, years.  Like, six or next three years until I left for junior high.  Oh.  Oh, it was the pits.  I just wanted to kill myself.  You didn't realize that one incident in school would just taunt you for the rest of your life. 
[01:25:30]  You get a nickname because of one dumb thing you did one day, and then now you're a senior,  and they're still calling you, you know, piss pants or whatever the fuck you did.  Yeah, unless you move away or, you know, go to a different school.  Like, yeah, you got to go into the witness protection program and move to another school.  That's pretty much what it was as a kid.  The witness protection program was when your family moved.  If you were, like, pee-pee pants or a pukey kid or shit-de-ca-ca pants. 
[01:26:00]  And you got a fresh start.  Like, I got a leaf.  Uh, let me see.  Witness protection.  It was pretty much right.  Yeah.  We got this guy.  Yeah, we all kind of maybe tried this one once.  Mike in Virginia, what's up?  Mike!  Hey, when I was a kid, my mom started dating some dude that I didn't like.  I'm probably, like, six or seven.  And so, you know, I didn't get any attention.  So one night, you know, it's bedtime. 
[01:26:30]  I start writing on my wall.  I was putting a runaway note together.  And, uh, well, I had to stop because I couldn't spell Florida.  You idiot.  Pulled it out at the bed and cried myself to sleep.  And the parents were on to us.  They knew where the fuck were we going to run away to.  Yeah.  We didn't have the skills to survive.  Anyway, I actually thought you, when you ran away, you needed the stick with the fucking  tied up bandana thing in the back. 
[01:27:00]  Hobo style.  Like, yeah, I think, I thought you needed that to run away.  Yeah.  Sorry, Jim.  No.  I'm just, I have a memory.  It's a little douchey.  A little bit.  A little douchey.  When I was, like, a young teenager, I wanted some attention.  So I put, like, these song lyrics that were devilish.  And I cut my arm and I signed it in blood.  And I hung it on my door.  Oh, that's devilish. 
[01:27:30]  Devil dogs were more evil than I was.  I was a devil ham.  You want more?  You know what's weird?  By the time I reached, like, for the most part, by the time I was in my teens, I'd already,  like, had a, I had, like, a thing.  I was able to, like, be funny.  You know?  You're able to kind of make people laugh and shit.  And so I kind of backed off on the attention thing because I got attention by being a funny  guy.  Although I still did douchey things, like when my chick broke up with me, I tried again 
[01:28:00]  to break my arm with a baseball bat because I thought if I had a cast on, she would feel  bad for me.  Boy, did I love trying to break my fucking arm.  What an asshole.  She busted her head, fucking bitch.  Leaving me?  Teach you.  For a non-white fella.  Kevin from Connecticut.  When I threatened to run away, my dad whipped a suitcase at me and said, go ahead.  Big man.  Leave.  Go ahead.  Yeah, go for it.  Take off.  A couple more of these before we go to break. 
[01:28:30]  Let's say hi to Mark in South Carolina.  Mark.  Good evening.  Hey, Mark.  Hey.  Just to let you know, when I was a kid, I broke my toe running around the corner doing  stupid shit like kids do.  I loved the attention.  It was great.  I got to sit anywhere I wanted to.  Well, it was starting to heal, so I decided, well, I wanted to keep this, but I couldn't kick  the wall.  I was too scared, so I was going to drop a sledgehammer on my toe.  Well, I'm holding it there over my toe, and I got too scared, and it slipped, and it fell, 
[01:29:00]  and it hit and broke my other toe.  Oh, Jesus.  At least you got a toe.  That's insane.  Toe break.  Imagine dropping a sledgehammer on your toe?  Yeah, a little sledgehammer on my toe.  And I thought, well, it'll do the trick.  And boy, it hurt.  I cried and screamed, and then once it healed, then my parents busted my ass, because they  knew what I did.  Amazing.  That was the worst.  Thank you, sir.  Good story.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Yeah, hi.  When I was little, I wanted my tooth to come out so bad. 
[01:29:30]  I had my dad wiggle it to see if it was loose, and it wasn't.  He told me it needed more time, so I went in my basement, took a hammer, and started smashing  my face until my tooth came out, so that I got a tooth very calm, and my parents would  feel bad.  Yeah, I would cry like crazy with the tooth thing, too.  When my teeth were falling out, it's like, eh, eh.  And my father was one of those that's like, let me wiggle it and see if it wiggles.  And he would wiggle it, and then wham, he'd pull it right out of my head.  I was fucking 20 at the time. 
[01:30:00]  It took about three more years for my adult tooth to grow in after that.  He'd say, let me wiggle it, but it wasn't your tooth that he was grabbing.  One of the treats our family got was we got to take a bath by ourselves.  By yourself?  One of seven kids.  We would pile into the bathtub all the time.  But every once in a while, you would get that one day where you could have a bath by yourself.  Where, you know, as one of your brothers, you could sit there and blow yourself? 
[01:30:30]  Well, sure.  That might have happened.  In the bath all alone?  He might not like us talking about that anymore, but it might have happened.  Now that he's a business owner.  And so I went to my mom one day, and I'm like, hey, I want to take a bath.  I want to do that bath thing.  And she goes, you're not dirty enough?  I was only like 10 or 11.  So I went outside, and I proceeded to just like try to make myself real dirty.  And I came in like a dirty mess.  She said, you're still not dirty enough, and I went back outside crying like a little baby again, 
[01:31:00]  trying to get dirty enough so I could take my stupid bath by myself.  That's pretty bad.  Fucking insane, right?  But you just reminded me of something now that is really, really bad.  This is really bad.  Are you embarrassed?  Yeah.  Yeah, because the dirty thing, this got me.  Oh, no.  And then I think I got beat for trying to get too dirty for a bath.  Really?  I think. 
[01:31:30]  They found out?  That's why a lot of my stories tail off, because then I don't remember, because I have to block shit out.  What's your story?  I was going to day camp, and I, again, wanted attention.  So there was part of these woods that were on fire a few years back, so there was still a lot of carbon and stuff on the trees.  Okay, sure, sure.  So I rubbed that all over my face and my arms, and I said that I was abducted and tied to one of these trees. 
[01:32:00]  And then I had to climb up the tree backwards all the way up to where it was cut off at the top, because it was like maybe 12 feet high, because it had been burnt.  And the top was kind of pointy, and it was all burnt, and I had to climb up backwards with my arms.  Like, no one could do this, but I had to climb up. 
[01:32:30]  And I remember coming out of the woods like I was all disheveled and full of the carbon and charcoal.  Yeah, and I was walking like I was ready to fall down, like the little kid that comes back to the village in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  That's how I was walking.  Like, ah, ah, ah.  And then, oh my God, were they looking for somebody.  I hate you. 
[01:33:00]  I was so bad.  You never can, they bought your story?  Uh, no, I don't think so, but, you know, they had a look.  It was a day camp.  Yeah, but the dork, you know.  Were the police ever called?  Uh, no, I think the counselors just looked.  Yeah.  Which tells me that they obviously didn't believe me.  Psychopath.  They obviously didn't believe me.  Right.  I'd love to see your little walk and your eyes half closed.  Oh, it's exactly what it was.  My eyes were half closed.  I was walking like, oh, I got out of it.  And I said, oh, yeah. 
[01:33:30]  And, you know, no rope or anything.  I said, you know, slip the rope.  Where is it?  I don't know.  I went away.  Yeah.  What happened to the rope?  I don't know.  No question.  I got a stomachache.  Oh, was I the worst?  What the fuck was wrong with that?  You're a bad one.  That's a fucking nerd.  That's a bad one.  That's a bad one.  That's pretty bad.  The feigning abduction?  Yeah.  Abduction.  Fucking Anthony Hurst.  Rob a bank to you, fucking creeper.  Hey, abduction. 
[01:34:00]  That's terrible.  Wait, listen to this story.  Sean in Georgia.  Sean.  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  I dislocated my knee playing hockey.  Or dislocated my knee and playing hockey.  And I got a good bit of attention from it at school.  So when it got better, attention went away.  So I decided to try it again.  And what I thought I'd do would be run towards the gopher tortoise hole and stick my foot in it.  That way I'd fall forward and it would dislocate my knee again.  Well, I did. 
[01:34:30]  And I fell face first and broke my nose and got made fun of because of that.  Plan didn't quite pan out, did it?  No, it didn't.  Yeah, they rarely do.  They rarely do.  First, trying to hurt yourself for attention story, by the way, where he tried to throw himself down seven flights of stairs to kill himself.  To kill himself?  Yeah.  That's different.  I wasn't like, you know, I wasn't trying to kill myself.  I was just trying to...  You should have.  I was trying to hurt myself enough where people would care about me and give me attention every day and love me. 
[01:35:00]  I hate your predator story that you just...  That's a great story.  That was really bad.  You had to shimmy up a 12-foot tree?  Yeah, backwards with the rope tied behind...  How'd your feet dig in?  I just climbed up and I used the rope and I pulled tight.  And then I'd shimmy up a little bit with my feet.  And then put the rope back up.  Like I described the whole...  I had to figure out in my head how I did it. 
[01:35:30]  Meanwhile, I just was sitting there rubbing the carbon off the tree and rubbing it on my face.  Why your face?  It looked so bad.  Exactly.  Why not your back?  Exactly.  It was none on my back.  It was on my face and my arms.  And I was just...  And then I came stumbling out of the woods.  Stumbling.  That's great.  I was stumbling.  Waiting for somebody to go like, oh my god, what happened?  But no one did.  No one cared.  I had to actually go up to somebody and say, I was just tied to a tree.  No one cared.  Like I thought I'd... 
[01:36:00]  Here was my scenario in my head.  I come stumbling out of the woods with all this charcoal on me.  And like the counselors go, drop everything.  And like, oh my god, what happened?  And I tell them and they're like, oh no.  And they feel bad for me.  And there's a manhunt looking for this person that did this.  And I'm like, you know, ooh.  So glad you're okay.  Yeah, yeah.  They're like, oh my god, Anthony.  Thank god you're okay.  But I staggered like that and no one cared. 
[01:36:30]  You're acting soft.  They're just playing kickball.  They should have played kick Anthony.  We could have lost you.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  Like, oh my god.  Oh, what a dick.  Oh, just what a dork.  A baby.  We all did dorky things.  A baby.  That's up there, though.  Oh, did I want attention?  We should take a break.  We've gone two hours without breaking.  Yeah, I gotta take a break.  Why are we gonna take a break?  We got a lot more calls coming.  And we might continue with this. 
[01:37:00]  There are a lot of fucking calls.  We got Jocktober.  No, I blamed Negroes for a fire.  I didn't blame Negroes for the abduction.  Somebody is suggesting I did that.  But no, me and my brother set Beauty's Hill on fire.  And then when the fire department showed up,  I said that Negro came and started the fire.  I was in kindergarten.  We do have similar stories, which is very strange.  Because I blamed it on the oily rags that I found in the woods. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, is that what you called them?  No, no, no, no.  Oily rags caused a fire that pretty much took out my neighbor's house.  You found out about spontaneous combustion the day before.  Right.  And, like, decided, hey, that's a good one.  We'll use that.  All right, we'll take a break.  Regroup.  We'll do more of your stories.  Oh, wait.  Brother Joe wants it before the break?  Ah!  God, you know what?  We should just go commercial-free today.  Why not?  Can we get to 10 o'clock without taking a break?  I think so.  Yeah.  Do you think? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, you guys can do that.  That would be exhausting.  Yeah, but you guys can do it.  Not everybody can, but you guys can.  Brother Joe!  What's up, Joe?  What's going on?  Hey, Ant, were you talking about Paul Bunyan day camp when we were kids?  Yes!  Dude, I don't know if you...  I came into the conversation late, so I don't know if you actually remembered accurately,  but those sadistic motherfuckers used to tie us to trees and give us, like, pink belly.  Oh, the pink belly.  Yeah, I remember that.  Like, the counselors would actually tie kids to the trees and then lift up their shirt 
[01:38:30]  and smack their stomach until their, you know, bellies turn pink.  That would get the shit out of them, man.  I remember a couple of kids, like, coming away crying and stuff, getting, like, getting  pounded on by these CITs.  They call them counselors in training.  Yeah, it was like a prison.  Just a bunch of little punks, you know?  I mean, there was a pecking order, and we were at the bottom of it.  We were just like the lowly inmates, you know?  Yeah, it was like a little day camp prison.  Yeah, I thought that's what you were talking about. 
[01:39:00]  Maybe you thought in your head that you were making it up.  No, no, I made up the one thing, because I remember staggering out of the woods, like,  oh, help me.  It's kind of odd that I don't remember that one.  Very good.  That was a good one.  We're on our way back from Georgia.  You played in Georgia?  Yeah, we played down in Georgia and North Carolina the past couple of days.  Yeah, coming back home?  Coming back home for a day, and then heading up to Mohegan Sun on Thursday.  We're at the Wolf Den, at the Mohegan. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, we did the Wolf Den.  Wolf Den.  Call it a full name.  That Wolf Den is a cool place.  That's where we broadcast it live, before they kicked us off the radio, because we weren't  friendly enough for a casino environment.  Are you kidding me?  Might have been us talking about shitting and assholes in their restaurant.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  We got thrown out of their fucking restaurant.  So it had nothing to do with the broadcast?  We were shooting darts talking about shitting, and a couple of the patrons were upset.  I remember that.  Yes, that was a good one. 
[01:40:00]  Hammered.  We were hammered.  I remember hearing about that.  Yeah, and your ex got real nasty with a couple of them.  Really?  I remember that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she was screaming.  She was screaming at them.  Yeah, fuck them.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, that was good.  Yeah, we're doing the 2U 3D show.  We're doing the video screens up there.  They have a gigantic video screen up behind the band.  It looks like Red Rocks.  It's pretty cool.  So go see Joe at Mohegan.  Yeah, absolutely.  That sounds like a lot of fun.  Thursday night, we're starting around 8 o'clock, free admission, and I will be playing poker. 
[01:40:30]  Afterwards, promptly at 10.  Nice.  Cool, man.  Good job.  All right, kids.  Take it to his.  You know, the day camp thing?  Yeah.  The people that ran day camp were sick fucks.  Yeah, they were.  That probably should be, you know, their background should be looked into a little further.  Well, now I think they're a little better, maybe.  I remember going to day camp.  Another story that just hit my brain.  In the summer, go to this day camp at Washington Drive School there in Centerport, right? 
[01:41:00]  And the guy that was running the day camp was a lazy fuck that was hungover.  Now I understand the whole thing.  Yeah.  You got to get older to understand.  The guy was a partier, you know.  He was hungover, and he was trying to make time with the gals.  Oh, really?  The other girls that helped out in the day camp.  So he didn't really want to watch us too well.  So he came up with this.  He told us all, if we went into the woods, there's a guy, his name is Future Man.  Uh-oh. 
[01:41:30]  Future Man fucks you in the ass.  Yes.  Oh, Future Man.  Not Future Man.  Future Man was a vicious, vicious guy.  Yeah.  And he liked to abduct kids.  Maybe that's who got me.  Future Man?  That's right.  I made it up.  But his whole thing was...  Oh, Uncle Future Man.  This guy was like Walter, a young Walter, Walter Matthau from like Bad News Bears.  He just wanted to sit in a chair, get some sun, sneak a little booze, and flirt with the girls. 
[01:42:00]  And where he sat, he could see the field where we were playing kickball and baseball and all that shit.  That's all he needs.  But as kids, you want to be in the woods, right?  Yeah.  So he comes up with this idea.  Well, if I tell the kids there's somebody called Future Man, you know, that's what he's known as locally, and the authorities can't catch this guy.  You're creative with the name, by the way.  Yeah.  Future Man.  Yeah, what a fucking douche.  He could have come up with something better.  Yeah.  And he basically said, if you go in the woods, you have a chance to be abducted by this guy they call Future Man. 
[01:42:30]  He told us this dead serious.  And this story haunted us for years.  I was scared to go in the woods because of this.  And all it came down to was the guy didn't want to watch us.  Yeah.  He was fucking hungover.  And he doesn't tell us at the end of the summer that, all right, I made that up because I really didn't watch you guys in the woods.  I wanted to make sure I could see you.  How long did you think there was a Future Man?  I'm embarrassed to say, but it's...  You still think there is, right?  Well, in the back of my head.  Could be Future Man.  Way past I should have stopped worrying about it, to be honest with you. 
[01:43:00]  Way past.  That was something that was just ingrained in my brain.  Yeah.  And made us all scared of the woods for years to come.  And this guy moved on to other dumb jobs and shit, not knowing what he did to us.  Yeah, they don't know the impact they have.  And just because he didn't feel like, you know, watching us as we ran in and out of the woods.  That's great.  Fucking asshole.  Yeah, they were.  And then at night, I would have nightmares about Future Man and our house, like, backed  up to the woods that backed up to Washington Drive School. 
[01:43:30]  So there was kind of a connection.  There was, back then, there was our house and then the school.  So a lot of woods in between.  And I'd be in my bed at night, fucking petrified of this Future Man.  Future Man was going to come.  What did Future Man do that was so bad?  Like, what if you just meet him and he's like, hey, I'm Future Man.  I remember.  The guy tell you about me?  He said that, you know, kids were abducted by Future Man.  Oh, oh, he took kids.  That's right.  Oh.  He just took kids.  Yeah.  I think, and I think if I remember correctly, he turned them to, like, stone or something. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, well, part of them anyway.  Yeah, I bet.  I was so afraid of being abducted as a kid, which is odd that I came out with the abduction  story.  Right.  But I was so afraid that I would cower in the car if people came up, like, next to the car  to get into their car, I would just start going, like, freaking out, thinking they were  going to abduct me.  Something weird happened to you.  And then that time, my mother stopped in the parking lot.  And then, you know, back in the old days, you just left your kids in the car when you 
[01:44:30]  went in the store for a few minutes.  With the engine still running.  Yeah, it didn't matter.  Everything's just gone.  So, this man walked over to the window, and he goes, hey, how you doing?  And I just fucking lost my mind and started screaming and crying.  And the guy's like, what's the matter?  He goes, and he goes, I'm a friend of your mother's.  You know, I work with your mom.  And then my mother came out and was like, oh, you know, Jim, how you doing?  But you don't know that shit as a kid. 
[01:45:00]  I didn't know.  But I, well, my brother was fine and my sister was fine.  And they're like, how high?  Oh, really?  And I was the one like, bleh.  Yeah, but the parents set you down that path.  They make you scared of every stranger that you're going to come across.  Yeah, but I had more mental issues, I think.  I just was fucking an attention craving, crazy crybaby.  I'm a big boy.  Eric made me who I am.  I'm his God made me.  Let's get Eric on the air, and then we'll take a break. 
[01:45:30]  Eric.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  So my desperate attempt for attention was I was about 10 or 11 years old, playing Little  League, not the greatest player, usually stuck in right field every game.  But so around that time, the movie Rookie of the Year came out.  So my desperate attempt was I tried to break my arm in the hopes that when I came back,  I'd be a star pitcher and talk to the town.  It would make your arm bad.  Jesus Christ.  That's a bad one. 
[01:46:00]  You stink.  All right.  Should we take a break?  I got a final test.  All right.  On the way, we're going to do Jocktober.  Connie and Fish.  Yeah.  Hey, Connie and Fish.  We look at a radio show called Connie and Fish today for Jocktober.  I'm psyched.  I love Jocktober.  Asian woman and Abe Vigoda.  And we have an update to the famous story, Remove Your Hat.  Remember the Remove Your Hat story?  No, it doesn't ring a bell.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We have an update on that fine young gentleman. 
[01:46:30]  Was she finally found guilty of being late on her hat payments?  Thank God.  I heard they're sending her to the pokey.  She's a danger.  Hat thief.  How long did that trial take?  Yes, and she lost her hair dye sponsorship.  We're going to find out next, Jimmy.  We're going to find out next if you're right.  Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton, who's going to be in Denver and on Leno tomorrow night.  Denver Improv, Friday, Saturday.  And let's not forget Leno tomorrow night. 
[01:47:00]  Leno tomorrow night.  That's huge.  Let's all take a peek and help out Jay Leno a little bit.  A little bit, right?  Right.  Yeah.  Good pickup, Travis.  MGMT or what do we say?  Management.  No, MGMT.  MGMT.  What is this?  It's a great album.  This is kids? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, this is kids.  Is this singing or just music?  The singing is awesome to this song.  You want to hear a little singing?  Yeah.  You'll never hear it on this, though.  I like when we come back to the whole song.  We tried that.  It was fun.  Yeah, get the version where, let's have this to the hook there, Travis.  Start over.  Hold on, I'll get it.  Now.  I love this.  Hope said.  I like everything I've heard from these guys so far.  What's new?  Might be up to two years old now. 
[01:48:00]  All right, so it's like, but it's in the time.  Yeah, somewhere around here.  We'll be right back. 
[01:48:30]  Where's the words?  It's like the guy from Dexy's Midnight Runner.  I don't know why I like this, but I do. 
[01:49:00]  You do like it.  I don't want to.  Oh, that's good.  Fruity new wave music, but I'm enjoying it.  You're liking it?  It's a little 80s.  Yeah, it's very 80s.  Oh, that sound is sort of happening right now.  Is it?  Yeah.  Then I'll just listen to the 80s. 
[01:49:30]  All right, let's fade out.  There are times where I know Anthony's disgusted, and it's little things like, it's these little  moments where you know he's fucking just really.  It happened yesterday.  That, to me, was the funniest part of the, can't you dig that out there that you said, I knew  that you could.  And then you went into an Iraq joke.  It was just that fucking silent revulsion.  Yeah, just repulsed by it.  Yeah, you're right. 
[01:50:00]  Moving on to Jacktober, but a couple things happening in our world today.  On Monday Night Football, Brett Favreau.  Brett Favreau.  Playing the Packers there on Monday was the most watched show in the history of cable TV.  Holy mother of God.  Really?  You want to guess how many people watched Monday Night Football?  Fucking 800,000?  I'm going to guess.  Everyone's in on it.  I love it.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:50:30]  Damn, that's funny.  I'm going to guess 1.8 billion.  Oh, wow.  That's ruined the guest game.  I love ruining the guest game.  The guest game.  Well, the previous record was 18.6 million for a 2008 Eagles-Cowboys game.  Jesus.  This had more than 18 million people?  Huh?  This had more than 18 million people?  Yeah.  For cable?  What was it on?  I don't know.  I'm going to guess ESPN?  ESPN, probably, sure.  Yeah.  They have Monday Night Football now, I guess. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  21.8 million watched Brett Favreau.  Brett Favreau.  That's amazing, huh?  What was the score of the game?  Who won?  We said this yesterday.  The Vikings.  I forget.  I think he had three touchdown passes.  So he was good?  Yeah, he did very well.  Yeah, so.  And then in other news, the remove your hat.  Remove your hat.  Do you guys remember?  Remember when?  That troublemaker.  Oh, yes.  She knew the hat was over.  The payments were late.  And yet she refused to return the hat. 
[01:51:30]  So they sent their best hat retriever.  Yes.  To go and get it.  And he also doubles for the walker people.  Because she was late on that one, too.  And the wheels.  She was alleging in an insurance stand that the wheels didn't spin.  So he had to tip the walker to the side.  He clearly saw it.  They spun.  I think you're right.  I think he was provoked.  Yeah.  Give me that hat. 
[01:52:00]  Jim Jeffries.  That is the worst clip to laugh at ever.  Oh, that is the greatest thing I've ever seen.  Watching it and laughing.  Look at her hair puff out.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Watch her head when he goes down again for the other shot.  She's down, go straight.  What?  You know what?  It's still on YouTube, which is awesome.  Opie and Anthony, remove your hat. 
[01:52:30]  It's how long?  This thing is really long, right?  I kept there for six months.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's about ten minutes long.  But the piece of shit.  It's hilarious.  It's really, really funny.  It's the footage of the old lady just minding her own business, coming out of the elevator  with a little winter hat on and her walker.  And this fucking savage.  She don't have the hat on for long.  Exactly.  Knocked her down.  The hat goes flying with the first punch and then knocks her down with a right hook.  Took five punches to get the old lady down. 
[01:53:00]  This guy's going to get raped in jail repeatedly.  Oh, yeah.  But he's a piece of shit.  And he beat up other old ladies, too.  And they got him.  Yeah, the man from the remove your hat video is found guilty.  And like Dan said earlier, how long ago was this?  Yeah.  06 or 07, right?  It took this long to find the guy guilty of this?  Yeah.  The video's right there.  What was the lawyer arguing?  Got to figure out the background of the old lady.  There's no face in it.  How did it take so fucking long?  I don't know.  But the guy faces up to 90 years in jail. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, he won't get that.  What are you kidding?  Well, he'll get a lot, though.  I don't think so.  Because he got convicted of hate crimes because she's over 60.  Oh, really?  The racist thing had done to do it, of course.  Is that a hate crime just because of their age?  No.  That seems silly.  It's like, well, he does have a record of punching old people, I think.  Yeah, he did.  I think he stole a pink bicycle or something from another old lady.  So if you pick a certain age bracket and just start fucking with them, maybe they could  say, eh, you know.  He only picks on them. 
[01:54:00]  So if it was race, it would be the same thing.  You only beat up black people or black people only beat up white people.  Oh, that's right.  It doesn't work that way.  I was ready to go, what the fuck is going on?  Exactly.  Some guy did something.  I watched it on YouTube the other day.  He took the news and a lot of things that were happening with Obama and stuff and just  completely switched around.  He goes, all I'm going to change is black to white and white to black.  He goes, and listen to this.  And he just started talking.  And it was like, you can't say that. 
[01:54:30]  Holy shit.  You can't say that.  But meanwhile, the other way around, it was perfectly fine and acceptable.  And there was not a problem with it.  The double standard is quite amazing, but it's there and there's nothing anyone could  do about it.  So Anthony, Lydia was last listening to the first two hours of the show.  Oh, Lydia, our resident shrink from Oceanside, from Oceanside.  She helps us out every so often on the show when we need a quack psychiatrist.  Hi, Lydia. 
[01:55:00]  A quack or a quack?  A quack.  You quack, quack.  You know.  Oh, right.  Hi, guys.  I called to beg Anthony one last time to get into therapy.  Why would I get into therapy when, here's the deal.  I identify everything that's, like, happened and I know what it is.  I've talked about it on the air, my crying, my attention-seeking shenanigans and stuff. 
[01:55:30]  I know where it comes from and I'm fine with it now.  Why do you think I would have to then go into therapy when I've dealt with this myself?  Because it's still controlling your life, Anthony.  How is it still controlling my life?  Please, please tell me.  Here goes Jimmy with the yup yups.  Here he goes.  She's right, though.  Shut your yaps.  Lydia, he does, right?  I think so, Jimmy.  How do you think, Lydia, it affects my life any differently than any normal human being that just has, you know, we all have our quirks, don't we, Lydia? 
[01:56:00]  We all have our quirks.  You felt so poorly about your self-image that you decided to get two monster tits put in your chest.  I should say you should go to fucking therapy for that, for having such a poor self-image of yourself.  You think throwing plastic tits in your chest is going to make a difference and make people love you.  It ain't going to happen. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, fuck, wait, you are.  Okay.  Can I put my cock between those?  So, what makes me any different that I've identified my issues?  I know what they are.  Yeah.  Lydia, do you think that Anthony's attacks on you are just a way to divert his therapy issues?  I would agree with that, too, Jimmy.  That a girl.  You think you'll remember all this after tonight's blackout, after you drink too much also?  We did learn you like a little booze there, Lydia. 
[01:57:00]  You like a giant tits and booze.  Most people would say that's covering up something.  That's good.  When you go past social drinking, it's covering up something.  Huh?  Please.  You guys have great memories.  I want to find you more passed out than Abigail Folger.  Laying there.  Of all the people that have fallen asleep, did you have to get the one that was almost decapitated by a cult?  I want one that ain't waking up.  See, that was the bit.  Come up with one.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:57:30]  It was just passed out.  A little past sleepy.  So what do you suggest?  What seems to be my issues that I'm still dealing with that is interfering with my life?  Well, that scared, crying little boy who needed attention desperately is now living in a really big house,  armed to the teeth, Anthony.  Armed to the teeth.  Yeah.  I like guns.  I like collecting them. 
[01:58:00]  I like owning them.  It's not that I think, honestly, it's not that I think I need so many guns as a defense mechanism.  You really can only use one, maybe two at a time.  I'm realistic here.  You're in a John Will movie, maybe two or three.  Two at a time, slow motion, dive to the left.  But I just like the, I like shooting.  I like shooting different types of guns.  It's target practice.  It's not, owning so many guns doesn't automatically put me in this paranoid, I think people are going to get me so I need more guns thing. 
[01:58:30]  It's just I enjoy guns.  I enjoy collecting them.  And wearing them at home when you're alone?  Well, sometimes.  There have been, you know, home invasions in my neighborhood, sir.  Very hard to run for a gun when somebody's holding a gun on you.  And Lydia, why do you want Anthony to live just a mundane life like most people out there?  I mean, if this is the way he wants to run his life, what's wrong with that? 
[01:59:00]  I have a licensed gun.  I don't really think he's hurting anyone.  He's partying and having a good time, and, you know, that's what he chooses to do.  We know who he's hurting, don't we, Lydia?  He's hurting Anthony.  There's a little boy somewhere inside that's being hurt, right, Lydia?  But I don't understand this therapy shit where, you know, they want you to live like just a, quote, normal life.  I'm not knocking.  I think Ant's life is working for him.  I'm not knocking therapy either, Lydia. 
[01:59:30]  I don't think Anthony should give up the guns, give up the pussy, give up the fun.  Not at all.  I think you should enjoy all that.  But I think that you should understand the way who you were as a child makes you the man you are today.  Exactly.  You want to find a little more happiness and not be so driven.  You have more and more and more.  No, here it is, Lydia.  Here it is.  Everybody on the face of this planet is a byproduct of who they were as a child and what they went through and how they were treated. 
[02:00:00]  Good, bad, indifferent.  Everyone is the person they are today because of who they were as a child.  So what is it that – why is it wrong that the way I was brought up has made me the person that I am?  Perhaps it's a good thing.  Perhaps it's good that I went through that and was able to be successful and use that insecurity to develop a sense of humor perhaps. 
[02:00:30]  Why is it always such a negative thing that has to be figured out and dealt with by a therapist instead of just me?  It's only your amazing strength as a person that got you through your absolutely horrible childhood.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Absolutely horrible.  I remember some very, very good times.  I remember some bad times too, but I don't think you're going to find anybody walking around that doesn't have horror stories as a child and fantastic great times as a child. 
[02:01:00]  I remember Christmases that were just magnificent, Lydia, presents, a lot of warmth and love in the house.  Really?  It was just wonderful.  Yes.  After my father left because he was drunk and yelling.  But of course – no.  But of course, you know, I remember good times, but there were shit times.  And you got to deal with them.  Do you know what therapy helps with, I find? 
[02:01:30]  And it helps with identifying these invisible triggers, these things –  Oh, triggers?  Yes, invisible.  Holy shit.  Yes, there's always other ways to find them.  I thought that was the reason I have all my guns that Lydia was talking about.  These things that – these weird little – it's almost like if you look at a girl who gets beat up by her father.  She marries a guy who beats her up.  There is not one fucking rational reason for that, and yet it happens every time.  So these weird things are put in us, and they affect us in ways we don't see as adults, and they fuck us up. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, but what if there really isn't an invisible trigger, and it's just I identify, I know what I was, I can laugh at the fact that I was a big crybaby and craved attention, and I finally put myself in a position where I get attention.  Well, let's be honest now.  You like to hit the – you like to tip a few back every once in a while.  I love the beers.  I love the beers, yes.  You're an – you have anger stuff?  I have it too, so I'm not judging you. 
[02:02:30]  I have anger based on what I perceive as factual information that makes me angry.  I don't just have irrational anger about things.  I read things in the paper that make me very angry.  I see things on the news.  Things that are happening in the world, they make me angry.  Anger is a human emotion.  We all have anger.  It's normally the cover-up of an emotion, though.  Anger is normally a cover-up.  Anger is a very normal human emotion. 
[02:03:00]  But it's –  What is it covering?  Usually, if you look beyond it, it's normally – not always, but it's normally a cover-up for fear or sadness or hurt.  Like if a girlfriend cheats on me, I'm like, that fucking cunt.  But deep down, I'm just fucking devastated that she cheated on me.  I'm hurt.  But it's fucking – it's a safe way to feel certain things.  Like if I'm angry, I'm in control.  But if I'm in pain, I'm weak.  If I'm hurt, I'm weak.  But if you're angry at the fact that maybe, you know, you see somebody raped and murdered, read it in the newspaper, and it angers you, how is that covering up anything? 
[02:03:30]  It's infuriating.  It is, but it's a sad thing.  Somebody who's raped and murdered is tremendously sad.  You feel sad and angered.  But I don't – I never feel sad for them.  I feel angry.  I do the same thing.  I mean, I feel angry.  I feel fucking want to scream and vengeful.  But it's a way of not really feeling how horrible it is for the victim.  Like I'm not feeling sad for the victim.  Oh, really?  No.  I mean, I would feel sad for the victim and angry. 
[02:04:00]  Anger is 95% sadness is 5%.  Because it's easier.  I don't want to just sit and cry all day.  No, no, no.  I'm not going to cry all day.  I mean, you know, it's not 1968 anymore.  And anger is unhealthy.  I know it's unhealthy, but we feel it.  It's like knowing something so toxic and unhealthy and then running with it.  How come – what made anger so toxic and unhealthy?  Yeah, I don't think it's unhealthy.  Oh, my God.  Irrational anger.  I don't think it's unhealthy.  Very unhealthy.  Irrational anger, I would say, is something completely different than rational anger. 
[02:04:30]  You can be angry at something – you're fucking stuck in traffic.  You're going to get angry.  If you pull out a gun and start shooting people, now you're irrationally angry.  If you're sitting there going, son of a bitch, I'm going to be late, I'm mad, that's rational anger.  Because you feel helpless.  Yeah, but anger comes out of things like that.  I won't disagree with Jimmy.  It comes out of fear.  It comes out of helplessness.  But it's an emotion.  But it is unhealthy physically. 
[02:05:00]  It causes stress, heart attacks.  It causes high blood pressure, hypertension.  Anger is fucking very bad for you.  But it's a real human emotion.  You can't avoid anger.  I think too much of it, you're right.  You can't avoid anger in your life.  No, no, no.  It's just how to control it, I guess, and to make sure it's not out of control.  Yeah, or to identify it.  It's like if I feel it, for me, it's the go-to emotion.  Right.  Like anger and lust.  See, you're looking at it from your point of view.  Yes.  You can't look at anger from somebody else's point of view that can control it and uses 
[02:05:30]  it rationally.  I don't know anybody like that in this room.  There's a bunch of self-destructive guys in this room.  You're probably right there, Jimmy.  Sam, I don't know how Sam deals with his anger.  He smiles and then beats his girlfriend.  Yeah, he's the angriest of all of us.  No, I mean, anger, you're not going to get away from it.  But you're not saying to get away from it.  But the bottom line is, it's destructive.  I know it's destructive.  I think in some cases it's not.  When is it not?  I don't know.  When you're trying to protect yourself. 
[02:06:00]  That's just self-preservation.  That's not anger.  Well, but the anger gets the point across, like, don't fuck with me anymore or whatnot.  And anger can also put inside of you a memory of something that maybe later now you won't  trip up on to be angered again.  Dude, I'm not saying it's wrong.  I'm not saying I feel it all the time.  Obviously, I'm guilty of it all the time.  Yeah, see, you have an anger issue.  Everyone in this room has anger issues.  We all do.  I don't know if I'm really that angry that much. 
[02:06:30]  Really?  Yeah.  I have a frustration.  One word.  Obama.  And go.  Well, that's not an irrational anger.  I am angry that he is our president.  Denial.  Denial, is it just a river in, where is it, Egypt, honey?  That's funny.  It's in Ohio.  The Ohio River, will it?  Mississippi isn't just a sippy.  All right, Lydia, come on.  Let's move on from this.  So you're saying I should deal with that with a therapist? 
[02:07:00]  I'm not saying that you should do it.  Shut up!  See, I think Anthony knows exactly who he is, and he's enjoying his life.  Who are we to tell him he has to do it differently?  I'm not saying he should do it differently.  What do you want from Anthony, for him to settle down with a nice lady and have a few kids?  Settle down, get a nice cure.  Huh?  Do not think that that's in the stars for Anthony.  I think it would be a big mistake.  Not everyone is cut out for parenthood and settling down. 
[02:07:30]  That's right.  But he should make his choices based on what makes him happy, not driven by an unhappy childhood.  But it's not driven by an unhappy child.  If I was driven by an unhappy childhood, I think I'd be a different person.  Listen, I'm driven by the fact that I grew up and I like doing things I enjoy.  I like what I have.  I like where I am.  I like my place right now, where I am.  And I mean in life, not so much just my place. 
[02:08:00]  Haven't you stayed in relationships long ago?  And I've done it too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Where you want to avoid confrontation.  Yes.  It's like all that stuff.  I've done that.  It's all from that.  Not like we're these fucked up pieces of shit, but it's like to sit there and talk to somebody  who is detached but who's pretty knowledgeable.  Yeah.  And they kind of show you these patterns.  The next time it comes up, it's like, ugh.  Like it's a little bit easier once it's identified to fucking not fall into the same trap.  I know.  The thing is, I am very good at self-diagnosis of issues.  I know what I do wrong, especially as far as things like relationships go. 
[02:08:30]  And I've, oh, I've improved the shit out of that one.  Yes, you have.  I will not be a fucking sucker or sap anymore as far as staying.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm talking about staying in relationships that are way too long, not confronting, things  like that.  I realize I have to do that.  You can pick pieces of shit to help up with to begin with.  What? 
[02:09:00]  Wow.  Lydia said you pick pieces of shit.  Whoa.  Whoa, Lydia.  What the fuck?  You're pissing off some people now, honey.  Exactly.  There's a bunch of angry teenagers out there.  How do you?  Yes, exactly.  You're pissing off half a pal talk right now.  Oh, my God.  How do you?  A piece of, piece of shit.  Anthony's army is going to get you.  Who are you dating now?  What?  I don't know who you're dating now.  Yeah, what if I'm just fucking swinging, baby?  Ah, shit.  Toots.  Right.  What if I'm just swinging, toots, and I'm not committed? 
[02:09:30]  Good for you.  Yeah, and?  The key word is identify.  As long as you identify what the issue is, then you can work on yourself.  I knew my anger got myself into some binds over the years, and I've been working on that  for the last couple.  Yeah.  You know, but I don't see anything wrong with continuing to be angry when it's appropriate.  When it's appropriate.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm too docile on it.  What happens is it gets into areas of self-sabotage.  It gets all the self-hatred.  Oh, yeah.  I get all that.  I had to work on all that. 
[02:10:00]  You're 100% right, Jimmy.  That's where it is.  But you're never going to totally get rid of the emotion, anger, out of your life.  No, of course not.  Here's how I see Jim's issue with anger and, like, my issue with something I can relate  to, alcohol.  Like, I can be angry in small doses, and it's okay.  For you, I think it's like alcohol, where you, with anger, you really got to fucking watch  it, because you can just run off with it and really fucking do self-destructive things. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  Whether it's self-destructive, like, to yourself or self-destructive to a relationship, a business,  whatever.  Like, that to you is like if you took a fucking swig of booze.  Yeah.  It's an addictive thing.  But some people can handle a little bit of anger.  You're correct.  Or a little bit of booze or something like that.  Yes, you're correct.  Not me.  Well, the anger part, not the booze.  I've seen you get angry, and I'm not saying, look, I get angry at the same shit, but your 
[02:11:00]  anger, when I, you get, you don't, it's, it's completely out of proportion.  And again, I might judge you, dude.  Is it?  Ow.  Easy.  But it's like, I get annoyed at Obama, or I get annoyed at Bush, or whatever the fuck  it was.  Yeah.  But to get so fucking angry for an hour, like, that mother, it's like, that's so stressful  for us.  It's like, and I do it too.  It's like, all this stress.  It's like, what am I doing to myself?  I can be annoyed about it, but why do I put myself into a fucking hour-long rage?  It's all I, it's fucking my blood pressure up. 
[02:11:30]  It does nothing to help the situation.  There are certain websites I go to where I'll agree.  I'll be angry for many hours.  That's where Jimmy and I, our anger is very different.  Mine are like quick and brutal.  Okay.  And then I get over it, though.  You do, you don't as well as you think, because you simmer with it.  It stays there.  You do simmer.  You're right.  I mean, I have to acknowledge that.  But I mean, that one burst of anger usually takes care of most of the issue I have in  my head.  But then you'll put it in a little box.  And then I'll simmer for a while.  You're right.  You're right about that.  And it comes out in a self-destructive way, or it comes out in a weird way. 
[02:12:00]  It's like, it's a fucking, it's like a weird gassy thing, for lack of a better way  of putting it.  It just kind of fucking seeps out.  And I am guilty of it, so it's like, I'm not trying to be fucking, I'm above it.  I'm horrible with it.  But I know it's fucking deadly.  Yeah.  The decisions you make when you're angry, the fucking, you wanted to kill people in  your truck.  And I relate to that.  You know what it is, though?  You don't do it.  I mean, I've been so angry that, yeah, I'd be like, oh God, do I want to fucking T-bone 
[02:12:30]  that vehicle right there?  But, you know, the rational part of you goes, you don't do that.  And you don't even really have to have that internal discussion.  You just know you don't do that.  But to scream until you have a headache, which I've done, racial things, I've done, all this  nonsense, the way it puts me in danger, or puts us in danger when we drive, is if we  yell out the window, or we scream at the wrong person in a rash moment, where we're not thinking.  I just give it some cabbies.  Well, still, some of them carry pistols. 
[02:13:00]  And not that you should be a pussy, but to allow the anger to dictate, like, ah, this  is another person.  I don't know what they're carrying, what their situation is.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's where it gets dangerous.  It puts you into these dicey situations unnecessarily.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, it's very difficult to not get angry.  I agree.  Oh, my God.  I would say it is impossible as a human being to eliminate anger from your life.  I think you're right.  I think you're right.  But to limit it is fine.  It helps me to eliminate it.  Not eliminate it.  You can't.  To limit it. 
[02:13:30]  You can't eliminate anger.  To be rational when you are angry.  Xanax.  That's the big thing.  Lots and lots of value.  To be rational when you're angry and to be able to go like, all right, I understand this.  I know why I'm pissed.  That's fine, I think.  To yell until you have a headache, that's bad.  But it's just, again, if it had no ill decision-making effects or no ill medical effects, that's one thing.  But it does. 
[02:14:00]  And the fact that I know that, and I still fucking allow it.  There's times where I know I'm sad or I'm hurt by something my girlfriend or any girl I'm dating does.  I'm just, my fucking feelings are hurt.  And I can't say it.  And so I get into this, you fucking bitch.  And I build up a head of steam instead of realizing I'm just really fucking hurt.  But you know what?  Then you fart and everything's okay.  For me it is.  Because you push the anger out.  The anger comes out.  You just push all that anger out.  Big, smelly cloud.  Then let her deal with her anger.  But then the anger lingers in the room for everybody else to enjoy. 
[02:14:30]  Thanks, Jimmy.  That is what that is.  That's joy pushing anger out of me.  I understand.  Bob Kelly wants in on this.  Bob Kelly, you're on with Lydia.  It's Opie Anthony.  Jim Norton.  What do you got, Bob?  Yo, dude.  You got your Guinness.  You got your mansion.  You got your millions.  Fuck all that psycho babble.  That's fun.  You forgot a boop, beam, beam, beam, beam.  Yeah, dude.  There's no use getting angry.  Life is good, dude.  I sit down.  I put the anger in a little basket.  I pick up my coffee.  Boom.  What am I angry for? 
[02:15:00]  It's everyone who listens to me talk like this who should be angry.  Wow.  Why would you interrupt that?  You know what, Lydia?  Let me just tell you this, and I'll be done.  Okay.  A doctor years ago once told me, whenever I get angry, just say pins and needles, needles  and pins.  A happy man is a man who grins.  Then I smile, and I forget what I'm angry about.  You do, except now you just drop the N-bomb really loud. 
[02:15:30]  Forget all the needles and pins.  It's too long and too wordy.  It's Ralph Crampton.  Oh.  The great Ralph Crampton.  The stupid I am.  The philosopher that is Ralph Crampton.  And he kept coming out, and he's going, he kept coming out because Norton was pissing  him off.  Oh, yeah, pins and needles.  Pins and needles, needles and pins.  Pins and needles, needles and pins.  He's getting all pissed.  I think we will have to agree to disagree on this.  Why don't we agree that you're about a piece of shit, Lydia?  Why don't we talk about Lydia's boobs? 
[02:16:00]  Lydia, why'd you get the big breast implants?  Yeah, why'd you get those?  What were you covering about?  What's the matter?  Someone laughed at your little flapjacks one day, and you said, let me get some big  tits, because I don't like people laughing at me.  It makes me angry.  No, I always had big, beautiful boobs, and then I nursed twins, which was sort of gross.  Oh, yeah?  And took a stall.  Ah, yeah.  Then they got disgusting.  So you got big tits, so you could hold your fucking beer bottle between them now, right?  Exactly.  Hey, I always wondered this about twins.  Did each twin get their own boob at the same time? 
[02:16:30]  Oh, good.  You ever do that?  Yes, they did.  Jesus.  You didn't rotate them just in case one was drinking more than the other?  Sharper teeth?  Or more of them?  Absolutely, I had to write down who got which one.  Are your nipples all chewed out?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  It toughened your nipples, didn't it?  Oh, no.  And this breastfeeding, is it a turn-on to the mommy?  Because that's a little confusing to me.  You got these kids suckling away.  Do you get a little moist down below? 
[02:17:00]  And you get all like...  Maybe it was one.  Huh?  It was not a turn-on.  No.  Is this one of my girlfriends here?  Not for me.  Come on, did you ever stand up and make a sucking sound off the seat?  What I can tell you is...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's fucked up, and I think you guys missed it.  Some of her girlfriends would breastfeed, and they would get turned on by that.  I knew there was something going on.  That can't be normal.  That's got to fuck with your head.  No, because...  Something that came out of your body is now turning you on.  It's just a feeling on your nipple.  It's a natural feeling.  I understand, yeah, but that's got to be fucked up if you don't understand what that's all 
[02:17:30]  about.  It's breastfeeding until 18.  Ugh.  It feels good.  You have to like it rough to get turned on by that, though.  Yeah, you like it rough.  Oh, really?  Because they're just doing damage, biting, and...  Yeah, those babies.  Got big cocks, too.  You have to oil your nipples every day.  All right, Lydia.  Enough about your nipples.  Jesus.  Enough about you.  What the fuck is wrong with you and your nipples?  I'm kidding with you, Lydia.  You know you're a great asset to this program.  I love you guys.  Have a great day.  All right, good.  There goes Lydia. 
[02:18:00]  Hopefully now she goes into a fucking rage blackout.  Lydia.  I would bet money she drinks more than Anthony.  Oh, I would love to see her out at a bar, at some fucking cougar bar.  She binges more than you, man.  She's just getting hammered.  I bet she's a sloppy-ass drunk, too.  I bet she gets real sloppy slurring our words a lot.  You know, I'm just a psychiatrist, and I think you need to use some therapy for you.  Shut up.  Have another shot. 
[02:18:30]  Take those fucking clothes off, the big-titted animal.  Let's go to Rich in Jersey.  Rich.  By the way, Sam has had her tit picture up the entire conversation.  There has just been a picture zoomed in right on Lydia's tits.  That's all I've been looking at.  Not just any picture.  That's my fucking photography right there.  That's an OP original.  Thank you, man.  Thank you.  And it's a fantastic picture of her very round, meaty breast and lovely cleavage.  It's going to be part of my cleavage calendar that's going to be coming out in January. 
[02:19:00]  Cleavage looks like a hiney.  It sure does, Anthony.  It sure does.  Rich, what do you got?  Morning, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Save me a pork.  So, my girlfriend decided just to fucking say we're on a break two days ago.  And, you know, I've been pussyfooting around the house, getting all upset.  And then now, the past two days, I've just been fucking real pissed off.  She wants to do this break because she needs her space and she wants her fucking feelings  and blah, blah, blah. 
[02:19:30]  What does a break fucking mean?  It means, do you want to go out and fuck other guys?  I get it.  That's what it means.  Maybe my dick's not big enough.  You know what you want.  After two years of this shit, fuck you, you cunt.  You know what I mean?  That, I think, is, like, the reason for a break.  It's like, oh, we'll take a break.  That's just, wait.  You want to fuck someone else is what you want to do.  That's what you want to do.  A license to get other pussies.  License to fuck.  What are you going to do?  A license to fuck others.  What are you going to do? 
[02:20:00]  Fuck someone else?  Fuck and suck.  Like, she's fucking, she's a senior in college.  I just graduated.  I got a full-time job.  She's like, we're in.  Oops.  Oh.  Poor guy.  Now he's going to really be angry.  What are we?  He's been rejected twice.  What are we, therapists?  Shut up.  Yeah.  Take out the yellow pages.  Fuck you.  Right.  That looks fun, jumping out of a fucking plane, man.  That looks scary.  Oh, fucking no.  Just watching some skydivers.  Would you jump out of a plane, Jimmy?  I might, man.  I thought I was brave enough to. 
[02:20:30]  There's no way.  Look at them with those tracking suits on.  Yeah, those things roll.  Like a flying squirrel.  I'm telling you, we're all going to start flying to work and I get our briefcases and  everybody's going to be in the air like bats.  Every apartment's going to be upside down.  Hey, did that old broad, is she still living to see that this monster is?  She is.  Oh, yeah.  103.  She's 103 now?  She's doing porn.  Three years young.  Get the fuck out of here.  She's 103.  She's 103.  Eliza Dushku is on Channel 5. 
[02:21:00]  She was on Letterman with Kiss last night.  Was she?  Kiss was on Letterman last night?  They were, yeah.  Is Dave still talking about his thing?  I think he mentioned it.  Or is he fading out of it a little bit?  He mentioned it.  Something about getting an understudy.  He had some joke.  But, you know.  I think he's not.  There's probably no new facts.  I watched that stupid fucking movie.  What is it called?  Bring It?  The Cheerleader movie?  Bring It On.  Bring It On just because of Eliza Dushku.  It's a good movie.  Oh, it's a great movie.  It is good.  Cheerleaders.  Yeah.  And then the black cheerleading team.  Gabrielle Union.  They help each other kind of. 
[02:21:30]  It's a good movie.  It's great.  I want to go on one of those things that makes you float.  No, with the wind tunnel.  That looks fun.  That I would do.  The strap is in the fucking.  Is that a guy or a girl?  The strap went into the guy's mouth with his helmet.  Someone calls up immediately and tells us how we can do this in Manhattan.  Let's go do that, Jimmy.  I'd do that.  It's like a big fan.  Yeah.  And it blows air up like you're skydiving, but you're in a cylinder.  Yeah.  And you're just kind of floating there.  But you have to control.  I want to go flying.  Yeah, you've got to control yourself.  You've got to have some nice balance. 
[02:22:00]  You'll hit the floor, for God's sake.  Does it teach you how to fucking fall?  I would hope they would.  I will be grappling like running in midair.  I think you'd hit the.  Yeah, I think you'd hit the.  Jimmy, we found our activity.  Let's go do that.  I think me and you will do that.  Let's do it shirtless.  Tell Steve to look up a place where we can do that immediately.  Can we go to a break and then we're going to do Jack Tolber?  We certainly can.  I have to leave early today.  No, you don't, Jimmy.  Oh, God.  No, you don't.  Oh, no.  Why are you leaving early?  I don't remember. 
[02:22:30]  I've got to get on that big magical airship.  Aw.  And go to the left coast, as I call it, and, you know.  I like to call it Hollyweird.  Not bad, Al.  Not bad.  If you've ever been there, you know what I'm talking about.  I call it La La Land because they're all kind of wacky out there.  Yeah, and it's L.A.  So it's like La La, L.A., L.A.  That's good.  Land of fruits and nuts, I call it.  California, land of fruits and nuts, get it? 
[02:23:00]  No.  Actually, no.  See, because, yeah, we get it.  Jen wants in.  Jen wants your advice, Jimmy.  Jen in Rhode Island, what do you got?  Jen?  Jen, Rhode Island.  Hello.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Jen.  Hi.  Hi.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, love.  Oh.  I want to hear more from Dr. Jimmy about anger because it's explaining the way my ex has been  acting to me.  Well, what do you mean? 
[02:23:30]  What's he saying?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  What's he doing?  He's just constantly angry with me over absolutely everything, and he's taking it out on the kids,  and it's silly, silly, silly stuff, but it's been two and a half years, and you started  talking about anger is, I think, I don't know, what the band-aid for feelings you don't want  to feel or something.  What were you saying?  Yes.  How old are the kids?  10, 6, and 5.  See, I don't know your situation.  I can't do that.  I would just guess, maybe, did you put weight on? 
[02:24:00]  I mean, maybe he feels trapped.  Maybe he feels like, I'm a certain age, and this is my life.  I got a wife and three kids.  You totally just blamed her.  No, I asked.  You just fucking blamed her out of nowhere.  You don't even want to know more about her husband.  You went right to her.  Maybe you're a bitch.  She's the problem.  No, I don't mean that.  I mean, I'm asking because she said he's been towards her and the kids.  What's the pussy smell?  What's the problem?  Oh, God.  But you have to ask, as a man, what would just make you be irrationally angry at your  wife and kids?  It's a feeling of being trapped.  It's a feeling of, this is it for me. 
[02:24:30]  I'm not going to, like, there's nothing to look forward to?  No, it's because I asked him to divorce me.  He didn't want to.  He's got a girlfriend now.  He's got a living girlfriend.  They're great together.  This is a weird situation.  His job's great, but I'm the one that wanted a divorce and he didn't.  And I just, so I'm like, why is he so angry with me?  And I can't, and I, and.  Well, because he wanted to divorce him.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  So you, she has a, he has a living girlfriend and you're still dealing with this.  Why don't you just go get a divorce? 
[02:25:00]  No, no, we are divorced.  We're done.  We've been divorced for two and a half years.  Oh, okay.  And he's still angry with you?  Yes.  And, but when Jimmy was talking about anger, really covering up other feelings that you  don't want to feel, I don't know.  I just totally run a bell.  And I'm like, that sounds just like happy.  Oh, maybe he wants you back.  Yeah.  Maybe he's sad that it worked out that way.  Yeah.  Maybe he's just sad that it worked out that way and hurt that you wanted to divorce him.  Yeah.  He misses your pussy.  Maybe.  Yeah, but he's got another one now.  Yeah.  But yours is better.  Are you with someone else?  Yours is tighter and wetter. 
[02:25:30]  I was.  Large black gentleman.  Yours just grips his wetteness.  Get back at him.  Just the right way.  But no.  Yeah.  The black guy was fucking until her spine hurt.  Did he put it in your shitter?  Straighten out her scoliosis.  Did he put it in your shitter?  What?  Did he put it in your shitter?  Good question.  Who are we talking about?  Your ex.  Your ex.  Your ex.  Your ex.  No, your ex-husby.  Yeah.  Who are you?  No, he didn't?  All right.  So that's why.  The new one doesn't allow him to put it in her shitter. 
[02:26:00]  He wanted a girl he could respect.  Exactly.  Not some whore who's going to give up the shitter.  I'm talking to her.  We hope we've helped you.  Yeah, really.  Through your tough time.  What great strengths we are.  Any other questions?  We're here to help.  What you hear is gunfire right before they hang up.  Right.  Thank you, Jen.  Thanks for listening to the show.  They hang up after they shoot themselves.  I don't know if we got any other questions.  I don't know answers.  Maybe it's the magical fucking self-hanging up phone.  Hey, guys.  Jack Tolber is next.  Stick around.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, I know you have.  Na, na, na.  Na, na, na.  A little old school here, huh?  Where's my Zeppelin fans today?  What?  Ant's not a Zeppelin guy.  Nah.  There's a fucking guy.  Never was, really.  There's a fucking guy on YouTube.  Could you find this?  He does the Rain Song.  Yeah?  Holy fuck.  Well, I'm going to play a little bit of this for you right now, Ant. 
[02:27:00]  Please do.  And you tell me.  I mean, you know your music.  I like to consider myself an aficionado.  I love how these guys, you know, try to, like, do songs and whatnot on YouTube, and some  are all right, and others just blow.  Wow.  Keep going.  Wow.  Live 73.  Jesus.  You put in Rain Song?  Yeah.  You didn't put Zeppelin, right?  I did.  You want me to?  Just put Rain Song.  You dummy.  Because it's not Zeppelin doing it.  It's not Zeppelin.  It's the whole thing. 
[02:27:30]  Is it Chocolate Rain?  No.  Oh, there he is.  The guy sort of looks like Roger Lewis for you old schoolers.  Oh, God.  All right.  Travis, turn that down.  Listen to this guy do a little Rain Song.  We won't play the whole thing.  Wow.  He's not a kid.  A little acoustic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus. 
[02:28:00]  Jesus.  Groovy.  Groovy.  It's groovy.  Well, a lot of guys have tried this song on YouTube, but they're pretty much saying this  version is the best one on YouTube. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  This guy, this guy, older looking dude.  If you put in the Rain Song on YouTube.  It just needs a little Grecian formula.  Yeah.  It has, it has what?  Almost a quarter million views.  Wow.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Yeah.  What do you think, man?  I think it sounds pretty good there.  I think my brother could do this song really, really well.  I would love to hear your brother's Rain Song. 
[02:29:00]  On a 12 string.  It sounds fucking amazing.  I got to apologize.  Kevin from Connecticut gets the credit.  Thank you, Kevin.  He sent me this.  See, I pay attention to what you guys sent me.  Yeah.  Hey, Kevin, I dug this big time.  Randy Jackson from Zebra does this on a 12 string?  Is it on YouTube?  Randy Jackson, Rain Song.  I want to hear your brother do it.  Yeah.  Have him come in.  Joe plays anything.  Yeah, I know.  It's crazy. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  You can do away with this guy.  Let's see if there's Randy Jackson.  Okay.  Let's see if Randy Jackson is doing it.  Tell me what you want.  Tell me what you want.  No.  No, but we can listen to this old Adam Lambert.  No.  Fuck that.  Why wouldn't Randy Jackson have a video on YouTube of him doing, like, something?  Daddy's home.  The one-man band.  Yes.  That's one of my favorite rock stories ever.  Oh, yeah.  When Randy Jackson said to the other guys, I don't need you because I can play all the 
[02:30:00]  instruments.  And I think, what place was it?  It was Frank Cariola's place in Huntington.  There's Randy Jackson without the rest of the guys that are now, like, selling used cars  and whatnot.  And he is a one-man band on the stage.  Oh, yeah.  He's behind a drum set.  He's got a guitar.  That's all he does.  He's got...  It was just ridiculous.  It looked exhausting for the guy.  Put Zebra.  Zebra.  Put Zebra Rain Song.  Oh, there you go.  Maybe, um...  Yeah.  Put Zebra.  Oh, people want to hear you play it on the slide whistle, the Rain Song. 
[02:30:30]  Oh, my God.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  A little request from Stephen S.  To play that.  That's a tough song.  And Blue Heeler saying, I'm not impressed.  All right.  All right.  What can I tell you?  That's a tough one.  I'd have to play along with it first.  No Zebra?  No Zebra either.  Wow.  What happened?  Zebra not with the internet?  No.  The intertubes?  They don't think it's going to take off.  It's not good.  It's a fad.  And then this guy's saying that's the easiest song to play.  Hold on. 
[02:31:00]  Daniel, what's up, buddy?  Another much.  The Rain Song is incredibly easy to play.  It has its own tuning.  You really don't even need to hold more than three frets at a time.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  All right.  All right.  What do I know?  Jeez.  That wasn't impressive at all.  I'm not busting your balls.  I'm just saying.  It's fucking not the most difficult Zeppelin song.  It's probably the easiest of all of them.  All right.  Jeez.  It sounded pretty.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  I like how it sounded pretty.  And it is normally played on a 12-string, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because then it sounds really big and full and pretty. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  Did he have an Esteban guitar and songbook also?  Is that what he...  Yes.  Fucking...  You ever get stuck late at night watching that infomercial with Esteban?  You too can play like Esteban.  Esteban.  I am Esteban.  And people are like, wow.  All you got to do is look at this book.  There are stickers that you pull off and put on your frets.  Mm-hmm.  And you sound like shit.  That's fantastic.  Let's go to Footer.  Footer.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, Footer.  Hey, real quick.  All for you.  That Esteban thing.  You know he got beat up and like robbed for his pot and shit once on the table? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, Esteban?  Get beat up and robbed like Esteban.  Yeah, Esteban.  That guy, he got beat up and robbed for weed and shit.  Like he had a lot of weed in the house or something.  I don't know.  Look it up.  Did he hide it in his cheap shit guitars he's selling on late night television?  You can play guitar too.  Check this out.  Did you ever hear any Great White Led Zeppelin live?  Great White shit?  It's fucking...  I mean, you know...  Yeah, Great White does Zeppelin better than Zeppelin did Zeppelin live. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, but you don't want to...  Abso-fucking-lutely.  I can't get past the fact that they burned 200 people alive.  You gotta cut people some slack.  I'm trying to get past the fact that, you know...  What's worse?  A couple hundred people died in the most horrific way possible, so it's really hard to enjoy  their Led Zeppelin stuff.  We lose a few rockin' mullet heads, but we get a band that can really crank out the Zeppelin.  All kidding aside, I have heard it and wow.  Yeah.  What song do you suggest we just get a taste of?  Yeah, let's get a little something with a great vocal dynamic. 
[02:33:00]  What song do you suggest, Futter?  And you know the vocals as far as, like, what's a hard vocal song?  I mean, pick anything.  The guy's fucking insane.  It blew my mind to know it was Great White.  I'm like...  Okay, play this one.  Yeah, that's a good one.  That's very high.  What's the name of it?  How about we play the one that's got the most views on YouTube?  Which one has the most views on YouTube?  Uh, uh, uh, um...  Since I've Been Loving You? 
[02:33:30]  Is that Immigrant Song?  Oh, Immigrant Song is...  Play Immigrant Song.  Yeah.  Play Immigrant Song.  Great White.  Oh, no.  Uh-oh.  What?  It's gotta be there.  Just shut up.  Danny would've found it.  No, he wouldn't have.  Danny totally would've.  Well, he got fired again.  What did you do?  You put in Led Zeppelin?  Oh, boy.  You passed.  You should've just put Great White.  Don't put Zeppelin.  Immigrant Song.  Danny wouldn't have put Zeppelin in.  He never would've.  He would've put Great White.  And no cover.  Just get cover out of there.  Great White, Immigrant Song. 
[02:34:00]  Watch what happens.  You don't know keywords.  You suck at keywords.  Look what we found.  Look what we found.  Look what we found.  You suck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  Great White.  That's a little lame right there, though.  Yeah, a little bit.  They gotta make it their own.  I want to hear when it really gets high. 
[02:34:30]  He's rocking it out a little more.  Holy shit.  Robert Flank can't do this anymore.  Go away.  All the way. 
[02:35:00]  That's good shit right there.  All right.  I'm over the fact they killed 200 people.  I'm back in with Great White.  Fuck them.  They're fine.  Where they torn.  Here you come. 
[02:35:30]  Here you come. 
[02:36:00]  You can tune the guitar that way and play it really good, but this guy does like backing violins and stuff.  Are you taking a piss while you're calling us?  Yeah.  Well, I heard that.  We only deserve the best from our listeners, so this is perfect.  I like the echoey bathroom and hearing the scream of urine.  It sounded like you got rid of a couple stones.  There was a couple plops in your pee. 
[02:36:30]  So what was your problem?  Let it play on.  I realize that a special tune, you can play the song, but the guy's really good.  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, the guy got a quarter million fucking hits.  Dude, we listened to him for how fucking long, though?  I get it.  Go to the middle.  No.  More importantly, I want to hear Fred Zeppelin's version of the rain song.  Fred Zeppelin.  Fred Zeppelin.  Does he do the rain song there?  Travis has more immigrant covers.  From who?  From the likes of who, Travi?  We have to guess.  Let's guess. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, detoned.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I have one more, too, if you want to hear it.  All right.  Yeah, let's hear the other one.  Yeah.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh!  Oh! 
[02:37:30]  Ah!  Oh!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  You are so fucking hot.  Ah!  Ah!  I'm so fucking happy here.  Ah!  Touch me so jealous.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  That's a great riff.  They stole this one, right? 
[02:38:00]  Huh?  They stole this riff?  I might feel the riff by them.  I hope not.  I'm not really sure.  There you go.  Very good.  Because that is a fucking great riff.  It's an amazing riff.  Yeah.  Hey, Dan from Ohio.  Very good question.  Dan.  Does YouTube have Scorch's leg zeppelin version?  Oh.  Oh.  You know, we haven't looked at Scorch's show in a while.  Is there another one, Sam?  You're supposed to be keeping us up on what Scorch is up to.  Well, he is.  He's doing big things right now. 
[02:38:30]  He's actually moved to the, what's it called?  Studio.  Like an actual TV studio.  Wow.  Like a public access studio.  And most of his clips now have no audio.  Because he had copywritten music.  Oh, shit.  That he was using on all his clips.  So his clips are up there.  And it says audio has been taken off for copyright reasons.  Oh, my God.  We can watch PFG TV in silence.  It's now a silent film. 
[02:39:00]  That's a great score.  So that's going to work out well for you.  What is that kid doing?  Well, it says immigrant song.  And there's like a kid.  What is that?  We're going to find out.  Hi, I'm Mr. Magic 78.  And today I'm going to play an immigrant song.  But I'm sorry to say it's not played by Led Zeppelin.  It's made by this other guy.  Just please enjoy.  He looks like he's about 12 years old.  What is he doing?  He's pretending to play guitar. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, he's lip sync.  He's lip sync.  This fucking bastard.  Fucking stinks.  I hate to do it well.  Ah, for 12.  What the fuck?  For a fucking one, that's not good.  Hey, do we have Ted Zeppelin's version of the immigrant song?  We certainly do, Gregory.  We do.  But Ted's throat is sore.  So it's going to be very limited.  Oh, all right.  Oh.  Wow.  Hey, Grey White's unplugged version of Baby, I'm Going to Leave You.  That's the one coming in a lot.  Woody and Philly.  I think that's a good one. 
[02:40:00]  What are we talking about, by the way?  We're talking about people that do Led Zeppelin better than Led Zeppelin.  Oh, okay.  We're in the Philly portion of our show, Jimmy.  You know better.  Where's the Rock Jocktober?  Sure.  We're going to get into that in a second.  Oh, yeah, we've got to get into that.  But Grey White does a great tribute to Zeppelin.  They put out a whole album and whatnot.  Sam, what did you do?  I didn't do a thing.  What is his problem now?  What could I have written?  Grey White.  Baby, I'm Going to Leave You.  Unplugged.  That's even more specific.  I can't even find it without the unplugged.  Just put Great White unplugged. 
[02:40:30]  Watch this.  I don't know.  Great White.  I don't know.  Unplugged.  I don't know.  Go ahead.  Now go to...  I don't know.  Where is it?  Okay.  Okay.  Are you panicking?  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  And also, I have it already.  I don't know what's in it.  Oh, shit.  He's not using it, too.  He's using a music lesson.  No, I have it on YouTube.  I could send you the link if I want to.  Back to you.  Could you send me the link?  Wow, you've been under the radar way too long, young Sam. 
[02:41:00]  I'm not under the radar.  Sam's really bad at Danny's job.  He's really bad at Danny's job.  Really bad at Danny's job.  Incorrect.  He rocks job.  Incorrect.  You won't even do the virus.  Your own job.  Incorrect.  All incorrect.  There it is.  Would you do the virus for us today?  I created the virus.  I don't think I can do it.  Oh, because you spelt it B-A-B-Y.  Did he really?  Well, you said baby.  You said baby.  It's spelled B-A-B-E.  Just showing your age.  That's babe.  Yeah, well. 
[02:41:30]  Look, I'm sorry here.  You're just showing your age.  Everyone knows it's B-A-B-E.  Everybody doesn't know that.  Yes, everyone does.  My generation, if you said baby, they'd say B-A-B-Y.  All right.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Check all fire exits, please.  Check all fire exits.  Oh, shit.  Nice head. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, he's amazing.  The voice is right there.  Fucking amazing.  I said baby.  Plant must watch this.  It's so mad.  I'm gonna leave you.  Fuck.  That's a nice wig he has.  Like one of the wayouts from the Flintstones.  Leave you in the summertime. 
[02:42:30]  Leave you when the summer comes along.  You want to hear what it kicks in here?  Yeah, I got to hear what it really comes in.  Leave you when the summer comes along.  It's fucking amazing.  That's all right, man.  Why see Led Zeppelin?  I'm like, why would you ever? 
[02:43:00]  I don't want to leave you.  That sounds like Plant, right?  Yeah, he sounds like Rick.  Plant can't do that.  No way.  There's no way he can do that today.  Ah.  Were you looking for the immigration song now?  Yeah.  Why am I stepping all over a pleasant listening experience?  Well, it might be, but that's okay, Ted.  I believe I really am got to ramble. 
[02:43:30]  I can hear it calling me the way you used to do.  That sounds like a young Robert Plant.  It's not.  He sounds very, very hollow.  I can hear it calling me back here.  Ah, fuck.  Okay, that was a...  He hit that fucking note right there.  Right the fuck there.  That sealed it.  God damn.  Yeah.  This was...  All right, we could fade out. 
[02:44:00]  Just the effortless, too.  He's just sitting down.  Yeah, he wasn't really...  That would be...  Like, there'd be veins popping and blood coming out of my ears if I tried to hit that note.  How old is that, uh...  That's got to be from the fucking 80s.  Is it really?  I don't know.  Ah, yeah, that's a good question.  That's got to be fucking old.  You got to think that's like 10 years old or something.  No?  Uh, Tool does No Quarter?  I didn't know that.  Dave in Connecticut.  Dave.  Yeah. 
[02:44:30]  No Quarter by Tool?  Really?  Yeah, definitely.  They do a real good version.  And Chris Cornell does Immigrant Song?  What?  Oh, thank you, Dave.  I'm going to look for that after the show today.  I think we're going to look at Zeppelin covers all day.  1990, that was from.  Get the fuck out.  You're talking almost 20 years old.  Holy mother of Christ.  Fred in Brooklyn.  Hey, Fred.  You won't believe... 
[02:45:00]  I always thought Chris Cornell had great range.  Yeah.  He's been singing the Immigrant Song on YouTube.  It's incredible.  All right, got to hear it.  All right, we got to.  I'm a giant Chris Cornell fan.  We all are.  Let's settle down.  And I'm like a homo fucking rocks.  Yeah, he canceled that fucking Sunset Music Festival, though.  What do you mean?  Because he didn't want to follow Ozzy.  Well, who would?  Is that the truth?  Is that the reason?  I don't know why he canceled, actually.  Yeah.  We love Chris Cornell.  I like him, too.  Fred, stay right there.  I love him.  All right, let's hear this.  We are about to play Immigrant Song. 
[02:45:30]  Is this live?  I don't know.  I can't tell.  Give it another moment.  Yeah, definitely.  I'm trying to mind the left one in my sleep.  Just a bit.  Just a bit.  Not many rock gods left.  Chris Cornell is definitely one of them.  He's definitely right.  I think it turned me on to sound bar and all that shit. 
[02:46:00]  This is amazing.  Oh, this is good.  You know how loud this would be there?  Oh, probably louder than this.  Perhaps.  Jesus.  Live.  Come and land to the ice and snow with the midnight southern ice.  Let's go.  Hammer of the dark. 
[02:46:30]  Drive our ships to the land.  Fall before.  Fight before.  Fall before.  Fall before.  Go and swim with.  But you know.  Already going to be the next show.  I don't like it as much as the other one.  Great vibe. 
[02:47:00]  It's a little too grunge for me.  Very cool.  I mean, you know.  Yeah, right now.  Thanks, Fred.  And that's hard.  There's so many better versions.  He pulled a bad one.  All right.  Oh, there's other versions?  See, once again, Sam fucked up.  Is that what you're saying, Fred?  It's Chris Cornell singing it.  He did a bad job.  Not the person who played it.  First of all, he didn't do a bad job.  He did worse than Great White.  No, he made it his own version. 
[02:47:30]  You know what happened, though?  I didn't mind that at all.  There was some, uh, you're a little pitchy dog.  There's a little pitchy dog.  That fucking singer from Great White.  Yeah.  Every note was, like, perfect.  Yeah.  And it was live, unplugged.  And you'd get Chris Cornell's live with a full band there and everything like that.  And he was, oh, I don't know.  Marie Digby does a very good cover of Umbrella on YouTube.  What?  Marie Digby, I think her name is.  Really?  Yes.  Thank you, Fred.  We're going to move on from Fred. 
[02:48:00]  Fred Zeppelin, everyone.  Thanks, Fred.  Fred ruined the show.  Yeah, man.  We were having fun with this.  And supposedly, Rat does ACDC shit now?  What?  That phone call came in and is now gone.  Hmm.  I want to sing my version of Immigrant Song.  Shut up, Lady Trucker.  Jesus.  No, this should be really good.  What's her version?  Yeah, let's hear it, LT.  Good morning.  Hi.  We got that part. 
[02:48:30]  Okay, bad morning, then.  What do you want to sing, Lady Trucker?  Oh, I want to sing my version of the Immigrant Song.  Go ahead.  Can I do that?  Drop, please?  Go ahead.  Dun-da-da-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Come on.  That's what our seat is saying.  No, her mouth is just open going, ah, feed me.  Ah, I'm hungry.  Is that it, Lady Trucker? 
[02:49:00]  That's it, sweetie.  So far, so good.  That was terrific.  Should end with squealing tires.  I know.  And sirens.  It's her going off like a Thelma and Louise type of suicide.  Bye, Lady Trucker.  I want to see her truck end up like the end scene in Duel.  I said end too many times.  I want to see the end of her truck end up like the end scene in Duel.  End.  That's good.  Well, listen, this is the end by the doors.  Oh, boo.  You get it? 
[02:49:30]  The end.  Exactly.  That joke was a dead end.  He didn't say end a lot.  Ten people that saw a bad Dennis Weaver movie are laughing.  Enough about the end.  At the end.  Let's see how to contest pig.  I ain't doing that.  I know.  You should end with the thing from the end.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  How are you all doing?  An end.  Something about an end.  Hey, first of all, Jimmy, thanks for turning me on to the wire, man.  I just finished season three last night.  It was fucking awesome.  Oh, of course.  You're great.  You're all right.  I know you're having fun playing all this good cover stuff and all, but I got hit up 
[02:50:00]  on Facebook about two days ago by this guy playing the original kind of style of guitar  called Andy McKee.  And I think you'd appreciate it.  You should say Andy McKee, don't you know?  That's right.  Andy McKee.  Andy McKee.  So he plays the Lucky Charms theme naked in front of a schoolyard.  I despise Andy.  Here we go.  Here's the Lucky Charms theme.  They're magically delicious.  Oh, okay.  Frosted Lucky Charms.  They're magically delicious.  He just thinks that over and over while dropping ropey shits down the back of his leg. 
[02:50:30]  He's mentally ill.  Ropey.  Like really, yeah, ropey fucking Lexapro shits.  Jesus Christ.  Why are we checking this guy out, contest pig?  I don't know.  I tell you what.  He's just got a really original fucking cool style of playing the guitar.  Does this have anything to do with what we're talking about?  Led Zeppelin.  I understand that.  But we're going with the well-known names and music doing covers. 
[02:51:00]  That's kind of the subject at hand.  Yeah, you're a little off.  Let's see what's a good cover.  Okay, I'm punching out.  Just check it out behind the scenes.  You might like it, Opie.  Marianne Faithful did a good cover of Working Class Hero.  I hate Marianne Faithful.  Really?  I like her.  Fuck her.  That eclectic shit.  Why?  That's a good song.  Someone attuned to it.  Some warbling fucking hen.  Her old stuff is very good.  No.  I don't know.  She is.  No.  Don't poop for her.  That was never a time.  Very unfaithful. 
[02:51:30]  What's a good cover?  Look, she did well.  Oh, here's a cover.  She's very successful.  Kiss did a great cover.  Uh-oh.  Paul Stanley.  And then, yes.  Communication Breakdown.  What?  Matt in Queensbury.  I never heard that.  I heard Kiss in 1977 did a cover of And Then She Kissed Me.  No way.  It's on Love Gone.  It's fucking great.  It's a really good cover.  Who did that version originally?  I don't even know the song.  It's Then He Kissed Me.  And Then He Kissed Me.  There it is.  Brown, brown, brown.  There it is.  I like it. 
[02:52:00]  Let's hear it.  It's the last song on Love Gone.  I'll kill everyone.  Love Gone.  That's a cock.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  It's a good one.  I've got enough and so I said I might take a chance.  Chance. 
[02:52:30]  When we danced, she held me tight.  And when I walked to home at night, all the stars were shining bright.  And then she kissed me.  His lisp comes through even when he sings.  Jesus.  I'll hear no bad-mouthing of Paul Stanley.  I'm sorry, sir.  I wanted to let her know that she was born as a friend. 
[02:53:00]  I didn't know just what.  It's the star child.  No, I'm good.  You don't like the star child.  That's really not that bad.  I love that version.  Not just because he signed my picture yesterday either.  Oh.  Thanks to some friends.  Don't you have a signature already though, Jimmy?  You don't understand.  Only 12 times.  I needed each individual photo from the band.  Each one signed so I could have it framed.  As my collection.  It dictates.  You've got to open up some kind of museum so the fans can check out your shit. 
[02:53:30]  I have to put up Kiss and Motorhead now.  I have both of them.  There you go.  Oh.  All the whole band.  It's one of my favorite bands.  It's one, two, three, four.  Me with the member and they sign it.  Collect them all.  I've only got three.  I need a couple more.  It leads to the question.  Greatest cover of all time.  Dan in Ohio started this with Man Who Stole the World by Nirvana.  Originally done by David Bowie.  No.  Nope.  All right.  This is the place to start though is what I'm saying. 
[02:54:00]  No.  Spin said that that's actually the best cover of all time.  Who gives a fuck what Spin said?  Hey, they just did a list and that was number one.  Well, where's the list?  I want to see if I agree with the dumb list.  My computer wasn't frozen.  And way to go by giving away number one.  It was not number one.  Did I say it was number one?  Yes, you did.  I thought you did.  I like that other Where'd You Sleep Last Night one.  By Nirvana.  It was very good.  By Lead Belly.  Oh my God, I love that fucking song.  That's fucking so much better than the original, but yeah.  We end with that song today, Ant.  It's a great one.  You hear the original? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, I've heard the original.  There's two versions.  There's My Girl, My Girl, and then there's Black Girl, Black Girl.  Right.  Black Earl?  Black Earl.  It sounds like it, yeah.  Yes.  Lead Belly, right?  Black Earl.  Black Earl.  Yeah, fucking.  Hedy Ledbetter, I believe was his name.  Oh.  Fucking.  In time in prison for murder.  I think he got stabbed to death or something.  He had some horrific thing happen to him.  He also sang, Oh Lordy, Pick a Bail of Cotton.  Oh Lordy, Pick a Bail of Cotton.  Fred from Brooklyn is saying, Kylie Minogue, Locomotion.  Best cover ever. 
[02:55:00]  Good Night, Eileen, he sang.  Good Night, Irene.  I said Eileen.  Good Night, Irene.  Good Night, Irene.  From A Little Picture, 1936.  Warner Brothers.  Yep.  Where's that list, Travis?  Sam can go to, yeah.  Oh, we got it right here?  It should be on spin.com.  What do you got, Ant?  You want to look at this list?  Taco, Putting on the Riffs.  Did it not go?  The 50 greatest cover songs.  It's in sections of 10.  I'll say Marvin Gaye did a fucking good cover of Grapevine.  That was Credence's song?  Oh, it was? 
[02:55:30]  Please show you up.  All right, keep going.  Who originally, Everly Brothers did Love Hurts?  I just know Nazareth.  Love Hurts.  The Who Summertons.  Elvis did a great fucking cover of My Way.  Oh.  Yeah, he did.  Elvis did a great fucking cover of Unchained Melody.  Elvis is going to be way up there.  Unchained Melody, too.  No, not in Stupid Spin Magazine.  He won't be.  His Unchained Melody is fucking amazing.  All right, let's slow down now, because we're getting to some stuff.  Jose Feliciano.  Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire.  Yeah, light my fire, light my fire.  Yeah, that's right.  The Doors Light My Fire. 
[02:56:00]  Sonic Youth with Superstar.  The Carpenters song.  We play that from time to time.  Jose Feliciano.  You know, you could do a lot worse.  Van Halen, You Really Got Me.  Oh, that's right.  Originally done by the Kinks.  That's a great cover.  Pixies.  He says, let's keep going, keep going.  Thanks, Denver Pest.  Black Sabbath, blue suede shoes, 1968.  Yeah.  Is that true?  Yeah, it is true.  That was Fargo.  Denver Pest.  Sorry.  All right, now we go to...  No Elvis so far.  How do you not mention Unchained Melody or My Way by Elvis?  We're kind of down at the bottom right here. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, okay.  Godsmack's doing Sweet Leaf right now?  Fuck.  Are they?  Well, I'd like to hear what you do.  Yeah, try to find that.  Thank you, Joe, on the phones.  Keep going, keep going.  What pops out at you?  No, no, no.  Give me anything.  Black Diamond's a Kiss song.  Or maybe it's...  Let me see.  Yeah, originally.  Yeah, the replacements of Black Diamond.  As a flaming lips later proved with Black Sabbath's War Pigs, good things happen when alternative  bands cover heavy metal tunes, but...  Uh-oh.  That's pretty cool.  They get props.  I don't mind if they just cover Sabbath.  Jimmy won't like it. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, okay.  They did a...  Can we hear some of the Black Diamond cover just for a second?  By the Replacements?  I like it, but the kids' version is much better.  All right, let's move on with the list here.  Someone's suggesting my version of the house next door to me was sold. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, shit.  Joe Cocker with a little help from my friends.  We know that one.  That's a classic.  I love when people cover...  Social Distortion did Ring of Fire?  Ring of Fire, yeah, I've heard that one.  I like when chicks...  A little taste of that.  Oh, fucking Johnny Cash's Hurt has got to be up there.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Go ahead.  I hurt myself.  Johnny Cash, Catch in the Cradle.  Ring of Fire.  Ring of Fire.  Oh, yeah, I've heard that one. 
[02:58:00]  What's that?  Four hours ago, I want a piece of data.  Nothing to do, no way to...  Oh, no?  No.  Kind of a second.  Okay.  I wonder if they'll give Sex Pistols from my way, too. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  My way!  That was pretty cool.  Yeah.  I hope Gigi Allen's on this list.  Yeah, number one.  Keep going.  Gigi Allen is funny.  Big Johnny Cash fan.  Very, very respectful to Johnny Cash.  We've done plenty of his shenanigans.  One Cowboy Junkie, Sweet Jane.  Oh, fuck.  That's a good song.  You ever play?  You want to move on?  I don't know.  Do you care about Sweet Jane?  No.  Done by Velvet Underground originally?  All right.  Move on with the list.  They're full of fudge.  George Michael, don't let the sun go down on me.  Is that on there? 
[02:59:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John.  Oh, that version is so old.  All right.  We're getting up to the 20s now, finally, here.  Come on.  Jay-Z didn't know Ace's cover.  Yeah, good for him.  Sure.  Johnny Cash hurt.  There you go.  Number 30.  Fucking 30.  That should be top five easy.  They put White Straps Jolene over that.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's why we hate these lists in general.  Yeah, these fucking alternative jizz buckets.  Johnny Cash hurt.  Should be way the fuck up there.  Yeah.  Alternative fucks. 
[02:59:30]  Keep going.  Tears of a Clown, English Beat.  Nah.  Black Flag did Louie Louie.  Yeah, great.  Smashing Pumpkins, Landslide.  That's a pretty fucking solid song by the Smashing Pumpkins as far as covers go.  Any Winehouse.  You've heard Smashing Pumpkins, Landslide.  Nah, I hate Smashing Pumpkins.  All right, sorry.  I want candy.  That's better than fucking Hertz.  That's better than Hertz.  I want candy.  That's why these lists go.  That chick was hot when that came out.  She was 16.  No shit.  Maybe 15.  No shit.  I think I saw her pussy in that video, too. 
[03:00:00]  Oh, my gosh.  She does some...  What?  I remember every time that came on, because she would squat down in some shorts or a T-shirt  by the beach, and it looked like you could see her big, hairy pussy.  I'd pick up glass rocks with her pussy?  Yeah, something like that.  Just picking up stuff from the beach?  Yeah, yeah.  She's like a metal detector in there.  What a ball buster this fucking list is to get through.  Lists stinks on ice.  Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.  It takes forever.  It's a pain in the foot.  That's stupid.  Johnny Cash hurt.  Now I don't even want to do the rest of his bit here.  I mean, look at all these songs that are... 
[03:00:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  Did it fucking...  I thought I heard it through the grapevine was Credences.  Am I wrong?  Maybe I'm wrong.  No, Marvin Gaye originally.  Did he?  I thought it was Credence.  Okay.  Uh, Lemonheads, Mrs. Robinson, that was a pretty good version.  Beatles did Twist and Shout.  That's not better than fucking, uh, than Hurt.  No, of course not.  It's not even that good of a song by the Beatles.  Of course not.  Twist and Shout!  Yuck.  Shut it.  We're not mentioning a lot of these songs because there's a lot of who gives a shit.  Do you want to dance?  Do you, do you, do you, do you?  Yeah, we get it. 
[03:01:00]  Soft-selled Tainted Love was a cover.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  Gloria Jones originally.  Jeff Buckley, Hallelujah.  Spuds Brother.  Sure, much better.  That's right.  Yeah, Spuds is true.  Ike and Tina Turner did do a good version of Proud Mary.  Yeah, but Hurt by Johnny Cash.  Of course, dude.  What the fuck?  I like Hurt by Ike.  Yeah, exactly.  Tina didn't.  She certainly didn't after that Phil Spector song.  Ooh, ouch.  We finally get to the top ten.  Here we go.  Your top ten covers the ball time.  Elvis is My Way is not up here.  It's a spin magazine. 
[03:01:30]  Gotta be.  Spin stinks.  You got ten, The Clash, Police and Thieves.  You got Elliot Smith doing 13, originally done by Big Star.  I don't know either one of those songs.  What's so funny about Peace, Love and Understanding?  Elvis Costello.  That's good.  Originally done by Nick Lowe.  The Zombie Summertime, originally done by George Gershwin.  Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Guns and Roses was very good.  This list blows.  Nothing compares to you.  Sinead O'Connor.  I agree with that.  Of course, the old Prince song.  Yes, I agree.  Devo.  Can't get no satisfaction.  Yeah, that's better than Hurt. 
[03:02:00]  And that's better than fucking Elvis singing My Way, you assholes.  Yeah, they really fucked up that song.  It's all alternative shit.  Talking Heads, I didn't know this until recently, but Take Me to the River is a cover.  Al Green did originally.  Oh, really?  Did not know that.  It's number three on the list.  Number two.  All on the Washtower was very good.  Hendrix doing Dylan's song.  And number one.  Oh, look at that.  Man Who Sold the World by Nirvana.  Elvis is not even on the list from My Way.  They should just be killed.  Elvis has not one cover on the list.  The candy is on there, by the way.  Yeah, of course. 
[03:02:30]  I want candy.  Well, that was a big waste of time.  Yeah, they stink.  That's why I never subscribe to magazines like Spin and Rolling Stone.  Fucking narrow assholes.  Just do the list.  Don't overthink it.  Man.  We got to make sure we have a little of everything in there.  Are we ever going to do...  Jocktober?  Jocktober?  Yeah, because I got to go somewhere.  I'm going to hear it.  Can we go make we?  Let's make we.  Let's go make water.  And we'll do Jocktober.  And we won't be taking a long break.  Because we got to get right into this before Jimmy leaves for Denver. 
[03:03:00]  I got to get on a fucking big...  That big airship, Greg.  I got to take that big airship to the West Coast.  You're leaving on a big jet plane.  Yep.  I can't remember the next lyrics or I would have jumped right in there with you.  Wait, does that happen?  Don't know when I'll be back again.  Yes.  Probably not for a while if I built it myself.  Get it?  Because he crashed in the wah-wah.  Sam.  See, when I do this to Danny, he usually knows what I'm doing.  I don't have training. 
[03:03:30]  That was a great out.  Training.  What the fuck are you?  We like to go out on laughs.  Jimmy had a nice funny.  We're laughing, giggling.  And then...  Jimmy go like that.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, that's actually pretty cool stuff.  I like him a lot.  Pink Sabbath, you said?  Yeah.  And what's the other one?  There's a girls' group with a C.  They've done, like, Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, and Changes by Sabbath.  Somebody might know who they are.  They're fucking really cool.  So you like when a female band does, like...  Yeah.  I have this one.  Sabbath, and I think there's one that does Zeppelin, too. 
[03:04:00]  A bunch of girls that do Zeppelin.  It might be the same ones where they do all Ozzy and Sabbath covers.  I fucking love it.  Hands down.  You know what, Pete from Connecticut?  Bravo to you, sir.  Pat yourself on the back, and if you got a bell, ring that fucking bell.  My friend.  Korn.  We used to love Korn.  Remember that, Ed?  Oh, my bell went.  Yeah.  Korn did Land of Confusion.  Oh, no, Land of Confusion was done by Disturbed.  That was great.  Korn did, excuse me, Word Up.  They did a great version of Word Up. 
[03:04:30]  So two bells for Pete, because he's giving me two good covers.  Yeah.  Disturbed did Land of Confusion.  That was great.  They did Shout, too.  Land of Confusion by Genesis was such a wimpy fucking song, and Disturbed just fucking  made it great.  And Korn doing Word Up was amazing, too.  This is the Genesis version.  It almost sounds like it.  That's the first part.  It almost sounds like it's the Genesis version.  Until this fucking angry motherfucker comes in.  Oh, yeah.  Angry Israeli. 
[03:05:00]  We interviewed him a couple times.  Scary fuck.  We like him, but very scary.  How fucking good is this?  Da, da.  Now, did you read the news today?  They say the danger's gone our way.  But I can see the fire still on light. 
[03:05:30]  Burning into the night.  There's too many men.  Too many people.  Making too many problems.  And there's not much love to go around.  Can't you see this is a lot of confusion?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Hey, guys.  You got to put the corral.  Does that just pump you up when you hear that?  Ah, ah, ah. 
[03:06:00]  Fuck.  All right, we can fade out.  Hey, we should have made our own fucking list.  Because then someone's reminding us of the Black Crows doing Hard to Handle.  It was a smash for the band.  That was a cover, huh?  That was a cover.  Yes, Anthony.  Yes.  And the band, Jimmy, Les Zeppelin is the all-girl band.  Oh, Les Zeppelin?  Are they lezzies?  That's Barrett from Pittsburgh.  She's a lezzy.  All right, we got to move on.  We got Jacktober to get into here.  Jacktober.  Let me get the official intro here for everybody. 
[03:06:30]  That's what I want to hear.  That's what radio shows do.  We should do that.  We should do a little of that radio stuff every once in a while.  Happy Jacktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  One-third of the women polls said they do this right after a breakup.  My guess is tickle their clit with a rake.  It's a celebration of craptastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  A little more specific.  That's pretty good.  That's the whole thing we did.  She looks like every actress who was a really hot teenager who's battling cancer later in life. 
[03:07:00]  So turn up this turntacular radio.  It's Jacktober on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, boy.  Just looking at their website.  This is going to be a doozy today.  Brother Elmo.  This is going to be a doozy.  Brother Elmo's doing radio.  Wow, that is Connie and Fish.  Connie and Fish.  God bless them.  Out of Madison, Wisconsin on Z104.  Which one's Fish? 
[03:07:30]  Fish is the man.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe, you know.  No, Connie gets top billing.  This could be Conrad.  That's true.  Could be Conrad and Fish could be the reason.  And, you know.  That's true.  We all know.  We all know that.  In Ordinary People, that was what Donald Sutherland called Timothy Hutton.  His name was Conrad.  He called him Connie.  Connie.  I just recently saw that movie for the first time in quite some time.  Did you like it?  Yeah.  We're burying our son.  Timothy Hutton is.  And God damn that cunt, Mary Tyler Moore. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, holy shit.  Holy shit.  She came out of, you know.  Oh, Lou.  Oh, Lou.  You know, came out of fucking.  Throwing her silly hat in the air.  Mary Tyler Moore.  Throwing her hat in the air.  Being all fucking fun.  Mary Tyler Moore.  And she went into that movie and played just a despicable fucking piece of shit.  An ice twat.  Cold woman, man.  Very cold.  Cold to the husband.  Poor fucking.  Was it Donald Sutherland, right?  Was the father?  Yeah.  You felt horrible for him. 
[03:08:30]  Just.  Oh, I couldn't.  She was just a bitch.  And also Judd Hirsch was in that.  Yeah.  Timothy Hutton won the Oscar for that.  Timothy Hutton was really good, man.  Flyed through the whole fucking movie.  He didn't stop crying.  I should have gotten a fucking Oscar for my childhood.  That's one of those movies that's too depressing to watch.  I love it.  It is so fucking depressing.  I can't.  Fuck.  Hi.  It's that girl that he met.  Yeah.  Oh, she killed herself last night.  Great.  And then he goes, you have to call Judd Hirsch.  What?  What happened? 
[03:09:00]  I talked to my son, David.  My son, David.  You were stronger.  Yeah, yeah.  You held on.  He let go.  Oh, that was good.  Terrible.  Heavy fucking movie.  Yeah, really.  Not light viewing.  Wait, no.  Not fun with your chick.  Not a popcorn and blowjob film.  What's some of those popcorn and blowjob flicks?  What's some of those popcorn and blowjob movies we got?  Oh, super bad.  You got to watch Raging Bull after just to pick yourself up.  The movie didn't win the Oscar, though, right? 
[03:09:30]  It won.  Individual performances won, but not the movie itself.  Redford won Best Director.  Director, right.  It won Best Picture.  Oh, it did win Best Picture.  Disgracefully so.  Why?  What was it against?  The Cuckoo's?  Raging Bull.  No, Raging Bull.  Oh, what did Cuckoo's Nest do?  Well, you know what?  Cuckoo's Nest won everything.  It beat fucking Dog Day Afternoon.  Right.  And I think Godfather 2.  That's right.  Okay, I was wondering why.  No, I apologize.  It did beat Godfather 2.  It beat Dog Day Afternoon.  It beat something that was like really...  Dog Day Afternoon, it beat, and something else.  Maybe that was it.  Cuckoo's Nest won it all, though. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  Can we go back to covers?  Beat me.  No.  Because somebody wants Jimmy...  You can't get fish.  Somebody wants Jimmy to hear Shinedown doing Simple Man.  And also David from Baton Rouge.  Baton Rouge, David.  Red stick.  This could be one of the greatest covers of all time right here.  You got Spider Bait there, Travis.  Give us a little Spider Bait if you got it queued up.  Oh.  What the hell is that?  It's for Black Betty.  Very good, Jimmy.  Whoa, James.  Very fucking good. 
[03:10:30]  Give yourself a bell.  By the way, another Lead Belly song.  What?  Black Betty.  Lead Belly.  Oh, Black Betty.  Oh, Black Betty.  Oh, Lord.  This fucking version.  Oh, my God.  Where's the still?  No kidding.  Holy shit.  Revenue coming.  This is good, yeah. 
[03:11:00]  Damn it.  Damn it.  She's always ready.  Bam, bam.  She's on Rock City.  Bam, bam.  Whoa, Black Betty.  Bam, bam.  Yeah, Black Betty.  I was singing through a walkie-talkie.  That's cool, though.  That's a cool effect, right?  Distorted.  Nice.  That's enough of that.  All right.  And then Shinedown doing Simple Man. 
[03:11:30]  And then we do some Jacktober, and then we get Jimmy out of here.  Yeah.  This stinks.  Overreacting idiot guy.  Guy.  This is shit.  Overreacting idiot guy.  It's got to be a character.  Well, Mama told me when I was young.  Said sit beside me, my only son. 
[03:12:00]  Listen closely to what I say.  Does he turn his head to breathe?  If you do this, it'll help you some sunny day.  This is good.  Scorch used to play this every day.  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  Look, it sounds like...  The original or this version?  This version.  I've never heard of this.  That's pretty cool.  I like it.  This is great.  Scorch's theme song, Simple Man. 
[03:12:30]  Simple ton.  Oh, take your time.  Don't live too fast.  Troubles will come.  They will pass.  Oh, it's changed up a little bit.  It sounds a little like torture.  Can this be bought, this song?  Yeah.  Don't forget that there is a song.  I'm making a cover. 
[03:13:00]  I love fucking covers.  For lack of a more boring thing to say.  I'm going to put a cover set together.  For my cassette player.  For your cassette.  Yeah, I'm going to make a cassette of all covers.  What Florentine did one time to Elena when he was this girl, Elena, he was dating years  ago.  She was a school teacher and he made her...  She wanted some songs, so he made her a cover of all of her favorite songs, but in  between each one, he would put filthy dice bits so she couldn't listen to it with her  friends.  Like, he put whatever the song was, like, you know, if you want to be happy for the 
[03:13:30]  rest of your life, and then dice, let's talk about antsy.  So she couldn't play it in the car with her friends.  It's just a whole love song.  That's great.  That's awesome.  Funniest man ever.  He's the funniest guy ever, Florentine.  Let's get some Jocktober, because Jimmy's going to leave us in a few minutes here.  So we got Connie and Fish on Z104 in Madison, Wisconsin.  What do we got on Connie and Fish there, Sam?  Well, Connie and Fish are, of course, the morning duo.  They've been together for, like, 13 years.  Wow. 
[03:14:00]  Married?  You'd think the way they'd go along, but no.  Love it.  They've been, you know, traveling across the country, and they finally landed in mornings  in Madison, Wisconsin.  Madison, Wisconsin.  And what type of a station?  It's actually a Top 40 station.  Top 40?  So I'll give you some of today's best hits and mix it in with some of their personalities.  And we've got to keep things, I think, Top 40, we've got to keep things a little safe.  Keep things a little safe.  I think so.  We've got to do about an hour and a half on the Packers, because Wisconsin, once again, 
[03:14:30]  you've got to go local.  You've got to keep it local.  That's how they're competing with satellite radio.  They tell everybody, just go local, because they can't do local.  Right.  Connie, Fish, Connie, Fish, take a seat over here.  Let me, yeah, just take a seat.  Look, we want to keep things local, because no one else can do that.  See, we can only keep it local.  That's what we have.  That's our asset.  So, a lot of Packers.  A lot of Packers talk.  People love the Packers.  People love the Pack. 
[03:15:00]  Don't worry about it.  And nothing dirty or anything.  And, Connie, you just keep Fish in line.  Okay?  Fish, I heard you.  I heard you at the party.  You can get a little crazy.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, you didn't see it?  There's a ridiculously good video of Nicole doing some kind of booty.  So, we were just imitating the booty dance through the window.  As she walked by.  She's fucking, she's been emailing me.  Really?  No. 
[03:15:30]  Look how we all went, like, you motherfucker.  It felt so good to say that.  We were all like, you fucking son of a bitch.  Do you have it?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You got it.  Now you got to see it.  Dude, we're going to lose Jimmy before Jocktober, though.  No, no.  Jimmy won't leave.  Jimmy won't leave with this playing.  All right.  You got to see it.  Yeah.  Nicole.  Look at this.  Watch this.  Nicole.  Go full screen.  Full screen.  I'm teaching Nicole how to drop it low.  Hold on.  Nicole, how do you drop it low?  Look at this.  I'm not going to drop it low.  Oh, my God.  Do you know what that would feel like?  Do you understand what I'm saying?  You have to do your butt. 
[03:16:00]  Do you understand what I'm saying?  It's not your boobs.  You don't pop your boobs.  Well, you pop your butt.  It's a big one.  Do you fucking even understand?  You can't even do your spine.  Look at that.  I can't drop it low.  First of all, you're on your heels.  You have to be on your tippy toes.  All right?  Oh, my God.  Marge, you like that?  Yeah, she looks retarded.  She looks retarded.  Retarded?  Well, how dare you talk about Nicole Biggins like that?  We're going to have her redo it for our show. 
[03:16:30]  I'd like to look retarded after that.  Make your retarded face.  Tell her tomorrow she's got to do it for our show.  All right?  I love it.  Oh, look at that.  You can't yank the guy out.  You know, you kill joy.  He's just sitting here.  We got to ask Nicole, why does she step in that bucket?  It's a box.  Yeah, why does she step in it?  Why not?  She's going to do what she wants.  If she moves around like that, she can do whatever the fuck she pleases.  Let's get one Jocktober in before we lose Jimmy.  Here we go.  Where were you, Sam? 
[03:17:00]  Connie and Fish.  It's just Connie and Fish.  Because sometimes, you know, they are a safe show, but they do tend to get a little wild.  Insert some humor in there.  Cool.  You know what I mean?  To make sure people realize, hey, they're on the radio.  They're not just your average duo.  So I figured the first clip, you could just start with track one so Jim can get a sense  of kind of the humor, where they're coming from.  As a comedian, he would be able to.  And you're right.  Connie and Fish come back from break.  Fish reacts to every emotion Connie says without a sound.  It's very funny.  Oh, with a sound.  Oh, with a sound.  That's why it's so funny.  All right. 
[03:17:30]  Now, back to Connie and Fish.  C-104.  602.  Welcome to Tuesday, everybody.  Isn't it great?  Yes, Tuesday.  The day after Monday, the worst day of the week, my friends.  It's Tuesday.  Probably a lot of us are tired.  Or hungover. 
[03:18:00]  Kind of sad.  Or ecstatic.  One or the other, probably.  I'd rather listen to that.  I just want to put that out there.  That's a great new sound effect.  Thank you, sir.  That is fantastic.  If I was going to listen to Connie and Fish, I would listen to this. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, that's unbearable.  Yeah, well.  I love it.  Or this.  Once again, that's the horn screamer.  Yeah.  Being happy.  Yeah.  Hate to hear how it sounds if it was angry.  Oh, I hope it.  Take that boat wherever you need it, young captain. 
[03:19:00]  So what do you guys think of Connie and Fish so far?  That is good stuff.  Jimmy?  That was riffing.  They were riffing.  They were just riffing.  That's kind of, they kind of come back a little casual.  Did Jimmy tap out 10 minutes ago?  No, I hit a button on my phone and a song gets playing.  Oh.  What do you think of Connie and Fish?  They're good so far.  I mean, it's got some laughs in there.  Yeah.  Macho man.  Do we move right on, Sam?  It'd be embarrassing.  Yeah.  I mean, the next clip, everybody's talking about David Letterman, you know.  Oh, it was topical.  Yesterday, we were playing audio. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, we sure were.  Fish instead reads David Letterman's monologue because he probably, and then decides whether  or not he thinks it's funny because he's in a position.  Well, you know.  Tough customer.  Why not?  Fucking grump.  Here's Fish reading David Letterman's.  Just shoot yourself.  It's my favorite bit we can't explain. 
[03:20:00]  It's my favorite fucking thing.  Irrelevant lump.  Shit.  Just get cancer everywhere.  I hope he gets heart cancer.  Oh, God.  Exactly.  And sneezes.  I don't know why.  It's supposed to stop your heart.  He just won't quit.  We moved on months ago.  Worst body ever.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what that is.  You guys are being mean to fish. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Okay.  Body like a blood worm.  Okay.  Let's talk about late night TV.  Okay.  Oh, I like late night TV.  Me too.  Late night TV.  Cue that music.  You hear that music?  Yeah.  Da da da da da da.  They also tell their show there's a lot of production.  A lot of production.  Yeah, yeah.  That's in the prep burger section under late night theme.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  David Letterman didn't try to avoid his sex scandal on last night's late show.  He even dedicated pretty much his entire monologue to it. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  He opened up with three quick shots with, uh, did you, uh, did your weekend, uh, just  fly by?  Ha!  I'll be honest with you folks, right now I'd give anything to be hiking on the Appalachian  Trail.  Ha!  And then, of course, uh, I got in the car this morning and the navigation, even the  navigation lady wasn't speaking to me.  Classic David Letterman humor.  He's not a monologue guy, but those navigation ones are kind of funny, to be honest with you.  You think?  Hey.  To be honest, I mean, Letterman usually not funny. 
[03:21:30]  Because I wasn't sure it was funny, Sam, but Fish is telling me it is.  Not only that, but kind of funny.  The fact that Fish is saying that Letterman is not a monologue guy, and he's been doing  a monologue every day, forever.  Dude, that monologue was hilarious.  And he's kind of a monologue guy now.  Yeah.  Maybe when he first started, it wasn't his thing.  But he did it.  But now he's kind of, kind of good at it.  How many years in training of reading a monologue does he have?  He was a stand-up, dude.  He did Carson. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, but, I mean, he's kind of funny, but he's not Fish.  Yeah, I'll be honest with you.  He's not Fish funny.  Yeah, exactly.  Fish is funny.  Do you hear him making those noises?  Ow.  Ow.  That is so fucking obnoxious.  I want that goose sound.  It's great.  What?  Oh, this?  It's got ringtone.  You should come out on stage to that every day.  You know what?  No, no.  Ringtone.  Quiet car in the train. 
[03:22:30]  And you just play that full fucking blast.  That's what I did.  And not listen to anybody say, shh.  Just look around.  Who's the phone is?  How great would that be?  You have to go on with a guy like Kenny, though.  Somebody who can protect you.  Yeah.  And just play that really loud.  You've got a problem?  Someone stands up and says something.  Sit down.  You're going to have a problem if you don't sit back down.  Listen to the birdies.  You're going to hear birdies. 
[03:23:00]  I got to go, guys.  I'm going to miss my flight.  Oh, Ryan Norton.  I don't like him as Jack Tolbert, but it's a safe trip.  Daddy got bills to pay.  Say hi to Mr. Leno.  Yes.  From us.  Yeah, please say hi to Jay.  I will, actually.  Did he get my gift?  I kept it.  It figures.  Did he get it for real?  I don't know what you sent him.  Ask him.  Unless it's a car.  No, I don't know what it is.  I don't think he cares.  Yeah, he drives a different one to work every day. 
[03:23:30]  I know.  He's Jay Leno.  He's a collector of all kinds of fascinating automobiles.  That's good, by the way.  I read his thing in popular.  I hate to see his car insurance bill.  It's got to be just outrageous.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm leaving right now, but I had asked sales or somebody.  Yeah.  They brought me, and I had the WOW sticker up on the behind me.  Yes.  And I said, they don't like logos, and they don't want to put some of those logos, so  I said, get me one.  Fuck all the other stuff.  It just says Opie and Anthony on it.  Yeah.  I said, get me a black sticker with yellow letters that say Opie and Anthony, plain as  day.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And I also had somebody change the Wikipedia page. 
[03:24:00]  So when you Google Opie and Anthony, the first thing that comes up is it can be heard  daily on Sirius XM Radio.  Perfect.  And there's no sticker to be found.  What?  Oh, my God.  I don't have what I asked for.  So we're missing out on a great opportunity.  It's just, you're going to be on Leno tomorrow night, and an Opie and Anthony logo would really  help the show and this fucking company.  It's mind-boggling.  So what's going on with that?  I don't know.  They're supposed to have it.  I said, I've got to have it by Wednesday morning. 
[03:24:30]  Does Steve know anything?  Well, stop right there.  Where's the fucking sticker?  He clearly asked for it a couple of days ago.  And have you been following up and making sure it got done in time?  Eric was following up on it, and he gave them back.  They did one person buy this.  Nice pass.  I did see the version that they did, which you saw and wasn't correct.  And then he brought it back, and no, they haven't produced another one.  Jimmy's leaving.  I know.  This is big for us.  Look, it's not going to amount to. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, here's the way I look at it.  Yellow beans?  Let's say it's an average Leno episode.  Let's just say 6 million people watch it.  It's a lot of people.  Yes.  If 1% sees the name in Google, that's 60,000 who might not have heard.  Who might go, where are these guys?  That's the way it works.  And if it's a half percent, it's 30,000 just checking it out.  If a half of 1%.  Yeah, because mysteriously, people would go, what the fuck is that?  What is that?  Run down to Greenstein's office, go right to the fucking top, and go, where the fuck is  the sticker that Jimmy's leaving right now for the airport?  They could overnight it to me. 
[03:25:30]  It's ridiculous.  I'll find out where it is.  Run.  He did say run, Steve.  Run.  Yeah.  I am running.  This isn't hard.  I know.  You guys don't want to market us, all right, but Jimmy wants to, and he's on Leno.  Let's go.  Sometimes I feel like a hippo on a treadmill.  Bye, guys.  I'll talk to you Monday.  All right, Jimmy.  Bye, boys.  Have fun in Denver.  Have fun on Leno.  Yes.  Have fun, and be very careful.  Look out.  Oh, of course.  A large percentage of people have herpes. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, well.  Guess who's safe?  Fucking Jimmy.  It's the beauty of getting herpes.  You don't have to worry anymore.  It's great.  All right, Sam.  Where are we at with this horse shit show?  Horse shit.  Connie and Fish.  Oh, Connie and Fish.  Connie and Fish.  Oh, they get a little edgy here, I see.  Oh.  They're not afraid.  Been waiting for that.  They're not afraid to get a little edgy.  That's the thing about Connie and Fish.  That's what kind of separates them.  You think they're just your typical blase, sounds like every other terrible radio show, 
[03:26:30]  but no, not these guys.  They'll take it to the edge.  Yeah.  Push the envelope, as they say, or the envelope, depending on who you talk to.  I say envelope.  Envelope.  I always say envelope.  I say envelope, too.  Here's a bit we need to do.  Just pushing it.  Fish gets a little edgy.  Does he?  He talks about who he would like to switch bodies with.  What?  Well, the thing is, one of the things that makes their show unique.  Mark, sit in for Jimmy.  I think you'll do a good job.  Oh, yeah.  I think you'd be terrific here in this spot.  One of the things that makes Connie and Fish unique is that they'll pose a hypothetical 
[03:27:00]  As radio personality?  No.  Sorry, I thought you meant they would pose as radio personalities.  They'll pose a hypothetical question.  Yeah.  Discuss it amongst themselves for five to seven minutes, and then ask the callers to  call in with their opinion and take calls on it for 20 minutes, which is something you  don't hear.  No.  Wow.  Never hear that.  No.  You don't hear that.  Mars.  More importantly, Mars.  Yeah.  Who would you switch bodies with? 
[03:27:30]  Connie.  What?  Just said Connie.  Yeah.  Why would you switch bodies with Connie?  I want to be a morning show.  Is this the virus bit?  We're doing the virus bit.  This is the virus bit with Mars.  He slammed his hand down on the table saying, I got this one.  Very confident.  Mars.  Yes, sir.  There's a rumor that E-Rock doesn't want to be the virus anymore.  Would you step up and try to be the virus tomorrow using the same voice and everything?  Oh, I can't get the voice. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, you can.  I'll coach you through it.  He's got it.  He's got it.  All right.  Think it over.  All right.  Mars, your job depends on it.  Thanks a lot, O.P.  But just think about it overnight.  Okay.  So who would you switch bodies with?  Anyone.  We're doing radio now.  Not just Connie or Fish.  You've got to say something where the listeners are going to go, oh.  Really?  Yeah.  Steve Tyler.  You'd be laid up in traction.  He's got a terrible, out-of-shaped body. 
[03:28:30]  I think he's 62 and he looks like a grandma.  Why would you switch to someone older than you?  Did you see the latest picture of him?  No, I haven't.  He literally looks like your grandma.  If you're figuring a rock star that's getting some pussy or something, go with a younger band  and shit like that.  Why Steven Tyler?  He's got a broken hip.  He might have an answer, though.  Why Steven Tyler?  Well, I always said to myself, if I had a choice and come back and reincarnated as someone  else, it would be...  What?  Recar-nated?  If I was reincarnated and I came back as someone else, it would be... 
[03:29:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  You were what?  Reincarnated.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm coming closer.  All right.  It would either be Steve Tyler or Mick Jagger.  But they're much older than me.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  No, today.  You know, the time machine.  Just a body switcher.  How could you be reincarnated into somebody that's already here?  If you die...  Or dead, since they're much older than you.  Or dead.  And then all of a sudden, they're back again?  Yeah.  You're going to get reincarnated to 1965? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  We're going to play the Connie and Fish audio.  And then you think about who you want to switch bodies with.  Okay?  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  And Steve's got some note that I'm not supposed to read on the air, but I certainly will.  Give it to me.  I certainly will.  We'll get it FedExed out to Jimmy in California.  Who said that?  That was the marketing people.  Which one?  Do we even know them?  Have we even met them?  Which one?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Or one of their big shows.  Maybe we should have met them. 
[03:30:00]  This is one of the disadvantages of working at a big company is there's so many people in  the air.  Your mic's not on.  They can't hear you.  Oh, come on.  Connie and Fish get a little edgy.  Oh.  All right.  Here we go.  26% of American men say they would like to switch bodies with this person.  Who is it?  26% of American men say they would like to switch bodies with this person.  Who is it?  What person?  You've got to go with a girl with big tits, right?  Uh, no, that's a little too risque, I think.  Why?  I think they're going to go with Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise. 
[03:30:30]  I'm just talking among us.  If you're going to switch bodies, why would you switch?  Right there.  Morning matchup.  Fucking.  Send me that link.  I've got to tweet that shit for the peeps.  I could absolutely spank it to that.  Yeah.  And I've never spanked, I think, to a fully clothed girl.  She does a horrible job, but she's terrible.  But she has such a fine body.  You can undress her with your eyes in there.  Because at one point it looks like she's better not to take a shit.  Which would be hot, too.  Do you think she realized when she was making that that people are going to watch this and  masturbate to it? 
[03:31:00]  No, never.  Like, this is just like a fun sort of...  Yeah, yeah.  But, like, a lot of guys are going to watch this and masturbate.  Oh, a lot of guys are just going to spank away at that.  Nude in a chair watching it.  Yeah.  Just sitting cock in hand.  Yeah.  Jacking away.  Definitely.  Mars, people are curious.  Would you want to be reincarnated into David Dukocny?  Please.  Person.  Dave.  What person do you think 26% of American men say they'd like to switch bodies with?  Who do you think?  I am not part of this percentage of men. 
[03:31:30]  Do you have somebody you'd like to switch bodies with?  Julia Roberts.  Yeah, I know.  That'd be kind of fun.  You'd stay home all day, I know.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  With my luck, I'd be on my period.  Go on!  Yeah, well, that comes with being a chick.  But you still get the fun bags to squeeze every day.  He picks a...  In between periods.  But he picks a chick that's so past her fucking prime.  That's the point.  Like, when did this come out? 
[03:32:00]  The 80s?  Yeah.  This was yesterday.  This was broadcast live yesterday.  And you're going to go down the...  You would say Scarlett Johansson, Megan Fox.  Julia Roberts.  She may not even have a period anymore.  There's a good chance that she's dry.  Menopause.  This is a very good chance.  Julia Roberts.  How old is she?  Let's figure that out.  Got to pop up IMDb.  Find that shit out in a second.  Did he come up with something a little more relevant for your re...  What does he say?  Reincarnation?  Yeah.  Who he wants to be reincarnated as.  Reincarnated. 
[03:32:30]  Well, if...  Sitting in for Jimmy.  Doing a great job.  I guess one of the MMA fighters, like GSP.  Ah.  What?  MMA guy.  Yeah.  He's got a great body.  Ew.  And you could...  Ew.  Ew.  He says, ew.  So you could kick some ass?  See, there's...  Batuu.  There's no real...  Batuu.  Like, I would think if you wanted to be an MMA guy, that would be the number one reason.  See, there's no good answer.  Because if you pick, like, a quote, hot guy, guys would go, wow, what, you like his abs 
[03:33:00]  and shit?  But then if you say a girl, then you go, what, you want to be fucked by guys?  Fucked by some dude.  So it's like...  Yeah, but Mars is...  You can't win with this question.  Mars' explanation was, I'd pick GSP.  He's got a great body.  Yeah, he's got a great body.  Julia Roberts is 42 years old.  42.  So if you're going to change bodies with someone, you know, pick, like you said, Scarlett Johansson.  Someone who's got some years.  If you're going to stay home, like he was speculating, and Fish was, or Connie was saying 
[03:33:30]  the same thing, that he would just be toying with himself.  Like, never leave the house.  Oh, Julia Roberts sitting there with her fucking, you know, whatever.  And if Julia Roberts was a band, she would be doing her farewell tour right now.  Yeah, yeah.  That shit is ready to go away.  So it's just at the expiration date.  Oh, yeah.  All right, well, Fish...  When in doubt, throw it out.  I always say.  Fish comes off as extremely masculine and heterosexual as they continue.  Yeah, just like Mars just did just now. 
[03:34:00]  Hey, Connie and Fish, what do you think the answer is?  Matthew McConaughey?  No.  Oh, good guess.  Not Matthew.  He's in shape.  Oh, no.  He's in shape.  Matthew McConaughey, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Good guess.  Good guess.  What do you think of Matthew McConaughey?  He's a sexy-looking guy.  Oh, what?  What?  Women like him.  What?  Women like him.  Yeah, you know.  Wait, what's it?  Matthew who?  The chicks.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:34:30]  What's his last name?  What is it?  Matthew...  Matthew...  Come on, virus.  What's his last name?  Matthew...  What is it?  McConaughey.  Matthew...  McConaughey.  Matthew...  Matthew McCotten.  McConaughey.  Come on, you can do this.  Someone say it once for me.  Okay, Matthew.  Matthew.  McC...  McConaughey.  McConaughey.  I got to see it, man.  I can't.  I got to see it.  We heard the name forever. 
[03:35:00]  I know.  We just said it four times.  Matthew...  McConaughey.  McConaughey.  McConaughey.  McConaughey.  I am from McConaughey tribe.  McConaughey.  McConaughey.  McConaughey.  One more try.  I know he's got this.  He's got it.  Patanka.  Buffalo.  Playing the part of the virus today, Mars.  McConaughey.  I got to see it.  He's right.  McConaughey.  McConaughey.  I guess he's Hawaiian. 
[03:35:30]  Yes.  Matthew McConaughey.  Let's listen to fish.  McConaughey.  No.  Oh, good guess.  I love Matthew.  He's in shape.  That dude's in shape.  What do you think the answer is?  How about a pregnant woman to see how they are?  Yes, that's it.  Men are that.  I guess this is only about a quarter of men.  Yeah, so a quarter of men could be that dumb.  No, that's not it.  Wait, haven't you always said that you wanted to be a pregnant woman?  Yeah, I'd be curious.  Or if you could be a man and be pregnant, you'd like to?  I think giving life like that would be pretty intense and pretty awesome, to be honest with you. 
[03:36:00]  That's my opinion, but what do I know?  You wouldn't listen to that radio show?  Holy shit, dude.  I couldn't turn it off fast enough.  I was so phasing out of that.  I just started staring at one of the fucking news anchor girls on CNN.  He thinks that the process of giving life would be pretty awesome. 
[03:36:30]  Giving life.  You know what?  Let's go to our expert.  Mars, what do you think?  Giving life.  Would you like to be a pregnant chick just to go through the experience?  I don't think so.  Why not?  It's a bad...  I mean, shit.  Here we go.  Why not?  You endure too much during pregnancy.  Like what?  The pains, the cravings, the labor.  I don't want any of that.  Nothing.  What are the good parts?  I don't know.  I hear they get hemorrhoids, too. 
[03:37:00]  Do they?  Yeah.  The pressure pushes down.  Yeah.  And pregnant chicks get like hemorrhoids.  They do get really horny.  They do.  Pregnant women do get really horny.  Yeah.  And what do you do about that, Mars?  You got to take care of business.  Being a man's man.  What do you do?  But what if you hit the baby with your penis?  Pregnant pussy is good pussy.  Why is it good pussy?  How is that?  It's really, really tight.  That area there gets really, really tight.  How does it get tight?  It starts opening up.  No, no.  Actually, before... 
[03:37:30]  You're very close to labor, but prior to that, like seven, eight months,  Yeah.  Really, really tight.  Like before the baby gets like nine, ten months?  Yeah.  Yeah.  How long is this gestation period?  I said seven, eight months.  Seven, eight months.  Yeah.  It's only nine months.  Yeah, so you got a month.  So it's like...  So you put your dick in there.  What happens if you hit the baby's head?  The soft spot.  That's not true.  How?  Why is it not true?  That won't happen.  They're in there.  Pregnant pussy rocks, huh?  It's nice and tight.  Except only if they're not showing.  Only if they...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even showing.  But why would they be showing at seven or eight months, you said? 
[03:38:00]  Before.  Oh, seven or eight months before they give birth?  That's what you just said.  When they're seven or eight months pregnant.  Oh, no.  He's saying when they're seven or eight months pregnant.  Well, then you would hit the baby.  Yeah, then you'd hit the baby.  You would not.  Why wouldn't you?  Not true.  They come out of the fucking...  How small is your dick?  They come out of there.  Fuck, it hits the baby.  We all know that.  You got to hit the baby's head.  Right.  Hit the soft spot.  That's why babies come out blue.  It's all the bruising.  Yeah.  Mars is my new favorite part of this radio show. 
[03:38:30]  Fuck the virus.  Do you call yourself Mars because you can't say your last name?  Is that it?  No.  Mars.  Mars.  Mars.  Fuck it.  Mars.  Call me Mars.  All right.  Mars.  Yes.  Matthew McConaughey.  Oh, okay.  Give him a little bit close.  McConaughey.  Fish tries to go in a different direction.  We're looking at Connie and Fish for this Rocktober.  Rock Jocktober. 
[03:39:00]  Excuse me.  Today's Jocktober, right.  Well, Fish tries to go in a different direction here with the topic.  Connie gives them nothing in return.  As these clips progress, we're going to start seeing that...  Or progress.  Yes.  They have...  Mars.  You could say progress.  No.  No.  They have no chemistry, these two.  Okay.  Yeah.  And by the way, Mars, pregnant pussy is tight pussy because that's actually the baby's mouth.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Mars.  Oh, Mars.  Oh, God.  Mars, what are you doing? 
[03:39:30]  What the hell's wrong with you?  It's awful.  You wait for the kid to be born before you start doing that stuff, you sick fuckers.  Shock jock, you.  Mars is shocking.  It's crazy.  Shock jock.  You, on the other hand, I know you didn't want to switch bodies with George Clooney, but  is there somebody that you...  If you could switch with anybody?  Um, yeah.  I'd like to switch bodies with George Clooney.  No, but I mean...  It'd be hot.  Yeah.  I mean, is there somebody, like, if you could pull...  If you could, like, you know, do something, play, you know, play a trick or work a magic 
[03:40:00]  thing or whatever?  No.  Switch bodies?  No one.  I can't think of anybody.  There are a lot of chicks with great bodies.  Jennifer Aniston has a great body.  Yeah, she has a good body.  You guys are, like, the same age?  She's okay.  She's a couple years younger than me.  All right.  And she's close, though.  Or a year younger.  You know what I mean?  Or would you want to, like, switch with somebody from, you know, that's, like, 20?  No.  Oh, my God.  They're getting nothing done.  Holy shit.  They're getting nothing done.  I swear to you, I was dozing. 
[03:40:30]  I'd rather hear the old Betty's talking about the dumb river and how they say good morning,  good night to her.  Good morning and good night.  And I have a wonderful breakfast and make beautiful friends.  Old bat.  They have no concept of going with each other?  No.  Like, fucking say something.  They figure...  What do you think?  George Clooney?  Yeah, George Clooney.  All right.  You have a magic device of some sort that I can't even explain.  But you change your body. 
[03:41:00]  What girl?  Jennifer Aniston?  Eh.  Eh.  That's my favorite part, that he sets it up to move along.  He's like, I know it's not George Clooney, but who would it be?  George Clooney.  Jennifer Aniston, she's your age.  No, she's a year younger.  Who?  What?  What?  Who cares?  Just say yes, Jennifer Aniston.  That means you're an old broad.  Why would you admit that Jennifer Aniston is younger?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  So she doesn't look bad.  Oh.  Connie.  Let's move on.  She keeps it real.  The chemistry, Anthony, of Connie and Fish have...  That's great.  It's like fucking oil and vinegar. 
[03:41:30]  Wait.  What did you write here?  The chemistry, Connie and Fish have none of starts to become...  Have none of.  Have none of.  Starts to become apparent.  Okay.  As they banter about George Clooney, listen as Connie yawns at the end.  Yes.  Always the mark of a good...  It's not even like a pause and a yawn while he's talking.  Oh, no.  Oh, and is it loud yawn?  I mean, we can hear it and yawn, but I try to keep it off the mic, especially if someone's...  You know, just... 
[03:42:00]  And Morris is filling in for Jimmy.  Just a little advice.  Yes, sir.  You can't just smile the whole time.  The mic is live.  Okay.  Yeah.  He just...  He's just smiling really big and looking around the room.  Every so often, you gotta go, I'd like to be in the body of Albert Einstein.  You know, just blurt something out in a Ted voice.  Here we go.  Connie and Fish at C104FM.com.  Jumpstart Trivia is done. 
[03:42:30]  The question was 26...  All right, I gotta stop because it sounds like this broad...  What's her name?  Connie.  Oh, Connie.  She doesn't want to be there.  No, she doesn't.  She sounds like she is miserable and doesn't want to even do the show.  The question was 26% of American men say they'd like to switch bodies with whom?  Answer, George Clooney.  I love the relationship that George Clooney and Matt Damon have.  They always make fun of each other.  Is it...  No, you mean George Clooney and Brad Pitt?  Oh, Brad Pitt.  Yeah. 
[03:43:00]  Well, Damon's kind of in there too, isn't he?  Yeah, he's kind of like the little brother.  He kind of seems like he's the little brother at least.  Brad Pitt is always calling George Clooney gay.  They're definitely two megastars.  I get a kick out of it.  Definitely megastars.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, seriously, talk about two megastars right now.  That relationship that they have with each other where they kind of mess around with each  other is pretty rare though.  I mean, it's pretty...  A lot of people don't have that type of friendship.  You know what I mean?  Uh-huh.  Nowadays. 
[03:43:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Fuck, would you shut up, Fish?  Is she a drinker?  I don't know what Connie's habits are.  What the fuck?  Fish is a dullard.  But he's at least trying.  You gotta...  He's at least trying to get something done.  Whether it's gonna be good or not.  At least he's trying.  She don't give a shit.  She doesn't even want to be there.  You know what though?  No, no.  I don't see that point.  I see...  Here's Fish.  Are you team Connie or team Fish?  Here's Fish trying.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm trying just as hard as Fish. 
[03:44:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's so rare.  That's um...  Was that some kind of...  Some kind of tricks?  Magic thing?  Magic thing that you have.  They're kind of...  Megastars.  They're megastars.  Megastar.  Megastar.  Megastars.  Uh-huh.  Shut up, Fish.  Because Connie goes...  Uh...  Yeah, they're always calling each other gay.  Yeah.  And Fish is like, I'm not going to acknowledge that statement.  I'm going to keep...  No, why would I run with that one?  That's crazy to run with that.  Maybe they're doing two separate shows at the same time. 
[03:44:30]  At the same time to save money for the company.  So he's broadcasting on one channel, a station.  She's on another.  Oh, maybe the online feed is a little bleed through.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you just hear...  I hate these two.  Oh, Mars.  Decided to stop smiling for a second.  What do you got on these two, Mars?  They just bug me.  Why do they bug you, Mars?  Wow.  Speak your mind.  Connie and Fish.  Why do they bug you?  Ah, they're just so typical on-air radio show. 
[03:45:00]  You know, non...  What happened to the Jim Norton impression?  I lost it for a second.  Oh, you were doing Jim Norton there?  Yeah.  My two lines of Jim.  Wow.  This is the first time that you can actually hear someone smiling on the radio.  Yeah, he's...  You hear like a little cotton mouth or something.  Yeah, and he's...  I need some water.  A little nervous?  I got some.  Absolutely.  It's great.  This is what Mars wants to do.  Yeah?  He doesn't want to be an engineer. 
[03:45:30]  No.  And he said...  He always comes to me and he says,  You know, I could do this shit.  I could do this.  Yeah.  I never said I could get on the mic and just...  That's exactly what I said yesterday.  I could say I'm fucking...  That's not true.  You want to put him in a lock?  I...  It's well within your means right now.  Boy.  Get up and do it.  No.  I will not.  Sam, would you take one of the headlocks from Mars?  Mars can never get a headlock on me.  Oh, shit.  Oh, damn, no.  You didn't just say that.  Mars, you're going to allow that?  You didn't say that.  You just can't hurt him.  It will be abusive. 
[03:46:00]  Snap your neck like a pencil.  You can't hurt him, that's all.  Kenny's right outside.  Kenny's not going to stop you.  No.  I love Sammy.  You can't hate the fucking guy.  Sam, what did you say?  I said Mars could never get a headlock on me.  I thought I heard that.  You can't.  I thought I heard that.  Mars?  You can't hurt him.  Exactly.  You can't hurt me.  You can't.  He thinks you're fronting with your skills.  Fronting?  Are you fronting?  Are you fronting?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Well, actually, I'm probably not as good as I thought I was. 
[03:46:30]  I got a little hurt last night.  Oh, what happened?  What happened?  Got a good armbar yesterday.  Yeah?  Yep.  Fucked you up?  Yep.  Who gave it to you?  One of the black belts over where I go.  Oh, shit.  You've got to stay away from the black belts.  Yeah.  Well, that's how you get better.  But they get overzealous.  Which MMA fighter do you think has the hottest body?  That's a trick question.  That's a trick question.  You're going to take that?  That's a trick question.  There's so many attractives. 
[03:47:00]  Absolutely.  Yeah, I don't want any of them to get mad at me.  All right, here we go.  I don't think armbarred you.  Jack Tober, Connie and Fish on Z104 in Madison, Wisconsin.  Connie and Fish are not on the same wavelength at all as they talk about boomeritis.  That's right, boomeritis.  It's the stuff that's affecting baby boomers where they're acting like they're not as old as they are.  They're still active.  You know what I'm saying?  It's a new term.  Boomeritis.  Baby boomer?  Apparently baby boomers are trying to stay young. 
[03:47:30]  And so they're still doing things that they did when they were like in their 20s and 30s.  Like rollerblading or something like that?  Yes, playing tennis.  What the fuck's wrong with that?  What, you're supposed to be an old guy?  You sit by the river and say good night every night and good morning in the morning.  What the fuck are you supposed to do?  Yeah, what's wrong with being active?  What are you supposed to do?  Start fucking playing bingo and shuffleboard and fucking sitting by the river like Anne said?  And rollerblading and tennis?  My goodness.  Sounds like you guys are starting to develop boomeritis. 
[03:48:00]  I'll fuck you up.  No, I will fuck you up.  I've got a little boomeritis going on.  That's the boss.  I mean, Mars might be a pussy, but I'll fuck you up.  That's the boss.  I know you are.  I would never mess with him.  All right, thank you.  Headlock.  Mars sucks, huh?  Sleeper hole.  Mars, he said you suck again.  Holy shit.  What's wrong with you?  Those are just words.  That's right.  Really?  Sticks and stones, right, Mars?  That's right.  You're going to allow that to happen?  How fast could you sleeper hold someone out?  Yeah.  It takes approximately seven seconds.  Seven seconds and someone will be out. 
[03:48:30]  It's scary that he knows the answer.  You just get it right in the crook there.  What do you do?  You push down on the back of their head like that and they're out.  Seven seconds.  Seven seconds.  Fuck, I bet you cannot do that to Sam.  You can't.  It's scary that he knows how much time.  He didn't even, like, pause.  Seven seconds.  That's got to feel good when you lock someone in like that and go like, man, you are fucked  right now.  You just feel the body go dead.  And you feel the guy go like, ugh.  Did they pull the Hulk Hogan, though? 
[03:49:00]  You hold the arm up and it drops down three times.  And on the third time, he keeps it up and then he starts shaking.  It depends if the crowd at the dojo is chanting.  Yes, yes.  Mars, Mars, Mars.  And then, ah.  The hand starts coming up.  And then he goes crazy.  Ah, he shakes.  Are you saying that Mars can't fight?  He can't fight me.  I don't know what he does, but he can't hang with me.  What are you?  Magic?  I got some kind of magic thing, trick, whatever.  Megastar.  He does.  Because Mars ain't going to touch him.  That's right.  Not going to touch him at all.  That's right.  He's in 30s.  Like rollerblading or something like that? 
[03:49:30]  Playing tennis, you know, doing whatever.  Good for them.  And so, well, no, because it's bad for their bodies.  They can't do that anymore.  Oh, they need to slow down.  They have to tone it down a notch.  Yeah.  But they're refusing to.  Are you one of those people that have you slowed things down that you typically would  have done in the past?  Yes.  I mean, you do notice that I said to Dan when Dan was turning 30 a couple years ago, I'm  like, oh, just wait.  Because he's always played on a basketball league in the winter.  Yeah.  And I'm like, oh, can't wait until this year's basketball league because he turned 30 in September. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  And then started in October.  I'm like, I can't wait.  He got his ass kicked that year.  Oh, sure.  I remember that.  That year.  Yeah.  He was in pain, twisted ankles.  Like, it's funny how you just hit a certain age and boom.  Are we listening to the new Propofol?  There's literally no back and forth.  Wow.  Audio Ambien.  Oh, my God.  It's on every morning.  They've been together doing this for 13 years.  Holy shit.  At least we faked that.  We still care. 
[03:50:30]  I know.  Come on.  Wow.  You do a good job.  Thank you, Sam.  Say that you have a baby.  Say that you have a baby.  Say that you have a baby.  Say that you have a baby.  Say that you have a baby.  You heard it myself.  I was right the whole time.  The boy P from North Carolina writes, is Mars eating his own ass?  Tell him to get his mouth off the mic.  Yeah.  You're breathing.  Have you breathe and your technique, too?  Not even on the mic. 
[03:51:00]  Fuck you.  Who are you saying fuck you to?  It's the feedbacker, I hope.  The feedbacker.  That's right.  And that's Sam, of course.  That's right.  All right.  What do you got on that last thing, the boomeritis thing, Mars?  I wasn't even listening.  Why?  You're in here.  Tuned it out.  What are you doing?  Let me say that.  Oh, sorry.  You're supposed to listen.  Okay.  Mars has boomeritis.  Sammy Sam.  Boomeritis.  Sammy Sam.  All right.  The final cut here, Anthony. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  October 09.  Today, we feature Connie and Fish on Z104 in Madison, Wisconsin.  Connie and Fish show how good they are by taking an interesting topic like fucking 20-year-olds  and moving the cars.  To stretching.  You got to pump it up.  You know how sometimes a caller will call up and just drop something in your lap like  a topic and you're like, wow.  Yeah.  You're like, thank you.  We could riff on this for an hour.  Listeners are the best part of this show sometimes.  Well, this is kind of, you know, Connie and Fish taking it in a different direction than 
[03:52:00]  you guys might.  What is that?  Like, for instance, if a caller called up and started talking about like, fire alarm's  going off.  If a caller called up and started talking about like having sex and then it led to you having  sex with a 20-year-old, where would you guys go?  Probably talk about that for a little while?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about stretching?  Riff on that.  Talking about stretching?  Like if you stretch?  Fire alarm's going off.  We're all right.  You sure?  Yeah.  Look, look, everyone's evacuating.  Oh, no.  Hey, D-Boy's here.  What the fuck? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  No, it's not a fire.  It's just the out-cute guys walking by.  Oh, boy.  Those are our friends now, Opie.  Flaming enough, right?  I set up the sprinkler system.  That's my flame bit today.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Those are our friends.  I don't mind the guys.  They actually held the door to the bathroom yesterday.  I think we're making progress with those guys.  That's not really good, though, when they hold the door to the bathroom for you.  Mars is really, really good friends with them. 
[03:53:00]  Are you, Mars?  They're good guys.  All right.  What?  I'm friendly.  I didn't say it.  How friendly are you?  Exactly.  He was the first one here to be friends with those guys.  You got to make friends around the new environment.  I didn't say it was a bad thing.  Shit.  Who don't you like?  You're free to speak.  I like everyone.  No, that's not true.  Who don't you like?  Name one person you don't like around here.  You're free to speak.  It's fine.  I don't have any names.  That's not true. 
[03:53:30]  There's no one that I dislike?  That's not true.  No.  All right.  Let's get the final track on here.  Yeah.  Good morning, Cass.  Good morning.  Hi.  Hi.  I tell you what, sex is still awesome, but I am not as agile as I used to be.  Isn't that funny?  So that is the thing that you really notice the difference in.  What's that?  That's the thing that you really notice the difference in with your age.  Oh, definitely.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  Smooth.  Yeah, but, Fish, you date people in their 20s.  In their mid-20s.  They even hit that point yet.  It's not even just that, though. 
[03:54:00]  With me, Con, I lost a bunch of weight, so I'm actually more agile, probably, than I ever  was.  Do you stretch?  Not enough.  No.  I really don't.  I don't.  I probably should.  Everybody says I should.  You know something I noticed the other day?  I was sitting on my couch, and I was trying to turn around and look at something.  I noticed I can't turn my head as far as I know.  Con, you're only 41.  I know, but I was like, I used to be able to turn my head really far.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just paranoia.  I think it's paranoia.  She's in the studio turning her head.  I'm going to go home angry now. 
[03:54:30]  Why?  I'd like to turn her head like Schwarzenegger does in movies.  What a babbling nothing.  She just decided at 41 that she's now old.  A lot of people make that mistake.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Well, she's also overweight.  Keep going until everything hurts.  Is she a fat pig?  Yeah.  I mean, you guys are both in immaculate shape.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you.  Thank you, Sam.  She's on the chubby side of things.  Yeah.  She is a little chub.  Yeah.  She's hiding behind fish. 
[03:55:00]  Exactly.  Comment?  Yeah.  Sam's a fucking brown-nosed man.  What?  You don't think Obi and Anthony are in good shape?  Wow, Mars.  They're in good shape, but you said immaculate shape?  Look at them.  Wow.  Look at them.  You know, you don't have to fucking put it on a level there, Mars.  You could say, you know, he says immaculate.  You don't have to fucking argue the point.  What the fuck?  We might know, all right, it's not immaculate, but, you know, I appreciate it, Sam.  You don't have to go in there with a dose of reality there, Mars.  I didn't realize.  I wish I had the job security that Mars does, apparently. 
[03:55:30]  Wow.  Apparently, you know, I'm not the one with the fucking wrap on my elbow either, my friend.  Yeah, Mars, I got a little something for you, my friend.  What's that, Sam?  You let that fucking elbow heal yours.  I'll let this trout flu heal on me, and we're going to do that physical fucking test that  you had to do in school.  All right.  The President's Physical Fitness Challenge.  Me and you.  I challenge you to the what?  The President's Physical Fitness Challenge.  Yeah.  Only one man is going to walk out of here with a presidential seal.  How old are you, Mars? 
[03:56:00]  Forty-three.  Oh, wow.  You're not older than me.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you look much older.  I can't take you on.  That's not.  Why not?  I'm a lot younger than that.  It's not fair.  Let's do push-ups.  Let's do push-ups.  How many can you do?  I don't know.  How many did I do in front of that Marine that time, Kenny?  How many did I do?  Fifty?  Do I need to remind you he beat out a Marine doing push-ups?  Right on the street.  And I would say that it's safe to say that Opie has less body fat than you do. 
[03:56:30]  Oh, for sure.  Okay.  For sure.  Yeah, we all see the Chubb Mars.  Oh, that hurt.  Thanks, Opie.  It might be your wife's cake.  That hurt.  They are delicious, but you could say no every once in a while.  Fuck, Sam.  I'm going to get smashed.  What does that challenge entail?  Push-ups?  Sit-ups?  Running?  We could do the push-ups.  I think you had to do a little pull-up thing.  What else did you do in that? 
[03:57:00]  If it's a challenge in respect, you're going to lose, Morris.  Oh, shit.  There goes Kenny.  Kenny's talking some smack now.  Kenny's in my corner.  Who do you got?  Who do you got?  Obviously, no one.  There might be some Double Dutch involved, too.  Double Dutch?  Double Dutch.  What?  Isn't that...  We didn't go to a ghetto school, Sam.  All right.  Well, we went to a very white school system.  Well, there was Double Dutch in my school.  Yeah, I understand.  I don't know where all this aggression is coming from with Morris.  Yeah, me neither.  We kind of bummed Jimmy how to leave early.  That's where the aggression is. 
[03:57:30]  We thought fucking Morris would sit in and do some good radio for 20 minutes.  Boy, were we mistaken.  Yeah.  I love this guy.  Thank you.  I do love you, Morris.  I love you bad.  Not in that way, though.  So relax.  Sorry, Morris.  That was good.  Bad news for you.  All right, that was good.  I think Morris did a good job sitting in.  Thank you.  Yeah.  We talked about being recarnated.  Matthew...  Matthew McCoy...  How do you say his name again? 
[03:58:00]  Matthew McCoy...  McCoy...  McCoy...  McCoy...  Did you put some spell on us trying to say his name?  Matthew McCoy...  McCoy...  McCoy...  Oh!  McCoy...  You had it right there, Morris.  Yes, I did.  All right, say it.  Matthew McCart...  McCartney, that's correct.  McCartney.  That's great.  Paul's younger brother.  That's really good, Morris.  They're going to cut us off, so what do you got? 
[03:58:30]  Matthew McCart...  McCartney?  McCartney is correct.  McCartney, yes.  Matthew McCartney.  Matthew...  He's not in today's paper.  He might be in the back.  He's hoping...  He's hoping his name's in the paper.  Matthew...  McCartney.  McCartney.  McCartney.  Well...  Matthew McCartney.  No, Macaroni.  Matthew Macaroni.  If you're enjoying the stupidity, make sure you listen tomorrow, because Rich Voss is stopping by. 
[03:59:00]  All right.  Maybe a little competition between Morris and Rich Voss.  And he knows stupid.  That might have to go down.  We'll see who mispronounces the more words.  The more words.  He said the more words.  The more words.  Fucking Mars.  Fucking Mars, you rule.  You do rule.  All right, you motherfuckers.  We out.  Yeah, we're going.  We're in OT.  Oh, fuck.  Look at that.  Point to that motherfucker, and let's get out of here until tomorrow. </pre>
