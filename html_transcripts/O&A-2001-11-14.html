<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on November 14th, 2001, was a whirlwind of vulgarity, outrageousness, and bizarre tangents.  The show began with Opie detailing his explosive anger, culminating in him punching a bulletproof subway token booth window after a frustrating commute, injuring his hand and toe. This sparked a lengthy rant against the perceived incompetence of NYC subway employees, fueled by numerous caller anecdotes about their own negative experiences with the city's transportation system and drivers.  Opie also recounted a previous incident involving a car accident and subsequent damage to his vehicle by the pedestrian he hit.  The discussion was liberally sprinkled with offensive language and descriptions of violent acts. The hosts briefly touched upon a Sam Adams beer commercial contest and the television show *24*.

The conversation then shifted to a scathing, sexually explicit and offensive critique of a Michael Jackson television special. Opie and Anthony, along with caller Marianne, relentlessly mocked Jackson’s appearance, making crude jokes about his physical features and alleged child abuse.  Macaulay Culkin and Corey Feldman were repeatedly mentioned in connection with Jackson.  Liza Minnelli and Elizabeth Taylor also received similarly harsh and offensive criticism.  A clip of Minnelli performing was played, intensifying their mocking commentary. The hosts also displayed and discussed a picture showing Jackson's changing appearance over time.


Following the Jackson segment, the show focused on a planned "Cherry Darts" Xbox contest,  involving throwing darts at a ambiguously located area of a woman's body. Numerous callers, sharing often pathetic and rambling life stories, vied for a chance to participate. One caller's attempt to donate the prize to charity backfired spectacularly. A prank call concluding this segment involved informing a supposed European vacation winner that they'd actually won a set of steak knives.

A subsequent segment showcased callers competing for an Xbox by recounting their "pathetic" life stories.  These stories included relationship failures, job losses, and other misfortunes.  One caller described his girlfriend's infidelity with a firefighter shortly after his job loss, while another recounted a car door injury. This segment also heavily featured sound clips and discussion of a "Weakest Link" episode with WWE wrestlers, particularly Booker T's repeated incorrect answer, "Captain Kangaroo,"  with Big Show and Lita also mentioned.  A 19-year-old caller, Jen, a pot smoker, shared her story, engaging in playful banter with the hosts.

Comedian Christopher Titus then called in to promote his show. Opie and Anthony played a profanity-laden promotional spot they’d created, highlighting the show's dysfunctional family themes and dark humor. Titus discussed his show's premise, upcoming episodes, his experiences with Fox, and commented on "Malcolm in the Middle," specifically referencing a brief breast exposure scene.  A news report about a topless woman outside Madison Square Garden offering oral sex to Rangers game attendees was followed by a brief, obscenity-filled phone call with the woman herself, concluding with a Stacker 2 commercial.

A "Mr. DVD" segment, featuring a Netflix representative, reviewed upcoming DVD releases, including *Shrek*, *Planet of the Apes*, *The Grinch*, *Apocalypse Now*, *The Godfather*, *Almost Famous*, and *Go*.  Mr. DVD detailed special features and the discussion included critiques of Mark Wahlberg's acting and a humorous exchange about a Shrek doll. Callers' questions and off-topic comments led to further comedic exchanges. The segment also included commercials for Neil Toyota and the Vermont Teddy Bear Company's anniversary sale, as well as mentions of the upcoming "Cherry Darts" game. The hosts also promoted a heavy metal comedy tour.

[00:01:00]  Anywhere else, 866-277-4.  Wow.  How are you, Anthony?  Very good.  Very good.  Sorry.  Disturbed.  Down with the sickness.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It just rocks.  Anthony, I have a confession to make today.  What?  What now?  I have a, uh, an anger problem. 
[00:01:30]  And I need to, and I need to admit it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know.  I'm waiting for an intervention.  There's always, uh, something that happens in your life when you finally realize you're  an alcoholic.  It's called a...  Or a faggot.  Or a drug addict.  Or a drug addict.  Moment of clarity, they call it.  I'm announcing today, what day is today?  November 13th, 2001. 
[00:02:00]  I, Opie, have an anger problem.  Anger problem.  What?  14th.  Oh, it's the 14th?  Well, um, yesterday, we all know what happened on the air, right?  Yeah, uh, there was a problem with, I believe, uh, was it a caller?  Uh.  What spurred the problem yesterday?  No, no, it was, uh, the dump guy that set me off.  Oh, the dump guy, that's right.  And you, uh, you took the $10,000 microphone that's hanging in front of you and swung it into 
[00:02:30]  the $60,000 board that is in front of you, knocking out that microphone over there and  screwing up Cart 5.  Cart 5, which, by the way, was never fixed because I heard during the time of Mike's show  all the commercials were screwed up.  Yeah, everyone knew when the commercial from Cart 5 was playing.  Cart 5, which, by the way, was never fixed because of the time of Mike's show. 
[00:03:00]  You two can call us today to the clinic on the helicopter.  Helicopter.  So that's, uh, yeah, that's broken still.  Well, yeah, so I lost my mind.  And, uh, well, it continued after, uh, we got off the air and I, I, I need to deal with  this, uh, problem I have because I think I almost got myself killed yesterday.  Well, you know something, in this day and age, uh, something like that could either get  you killed or arrested very easily now. 
[00:03:30]  Any type, any type of scene that stirs up anywhere, uh, usually the cops come, they arrest people  now.  They're not taking any chances.  I almost got arrested last night.  And yes, that was me beating up the, uh, the token booth on, uh, 57th and 7th after the  show yesterday.  Yes, that was me.  If you were one of the 150 people staring at the lunatic, that was beating up the token  booth.  Now, now, not beating up a token booth guy.  You're beating up a token booth. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Well, the guy was inside and I was trying to get out of him.  So, uh.  That's why they put them in that glass.  That thick, I, I, I found out that glass is awfully thick.  It's bulletproof.  I, I, I sprained my head, my right hand.  People are always very angry at those people.  And I think I, I think I broke my toe.  So, yeah, that was me.  A couple emails from people wondering if, if that was me, because it looked like me.  Well, it was me.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Now, what happened that got you so angry at the, uh.  Well, first of all.  The token, the subway token guy.  Well, I, I ran out.  Why are you dealing with subway token guy?  Well, I ran out of money on my Metro card.  And then with going to Philly and stuff, I forgot.  And I didn't have enough money, which is par for the course, as you all know.  I don't have my template on it.  So, so I had, I had like three bucks.  So I'm, I'm like, all right, I'll buy two tokens.  That'll get me through for the next two trips.  Right.  And then I'll get some money for my place.  And I'll, and I'll get a Metro card and I'll be back in business. 
[00:05:00]  Okay.  Right.  So, uh, these token booth guys are the biggest a-holes in New York City.  They probably have the easiest job in New York City.  And they had the biggest effing attitude.  Stand there in your bulletproof container and dole out tokens.  These guys are like the soup Nazis.  Yeah.  They really are.  Like, there's a protocol.  You, you got to, uh, carefully hand them your money.  You can't like speak.  You can't raise your voice.  Don't ask any stupid questions because they will eff with you. 
[00:05:30]  Garen, I know they do this now.  No token for you.  Exactly.  And if there's out.  And you ever notice there's two guys in each token booth?  If only one guy works.  Yeah.  The other guy's much too busy doing whatever he's doing.  Must be a union thing.  You have to have two people in there.  So, I get up to the, uh, the token booth last night after the show.  And I was, I was in rare form, uh, yesterday to begin with.  I was so close to snapping.  It was just going to take the littlest of things to get me going.  And, uh, I get online at the token booth, Anthony. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  The other thing I should, uh, explain.  We get off the air around seven.  I have to catch a 722 train every night.  Very close.  Everyone around here knows it.  Show's over.  What do I do?  He flees.  I run like a lunatic because I only have about two minutes to spare every single night.  And there are nights I don't make it.  So, everything has to work out perfect.  The subway train has to arrive at the same time.  There can't be too many tours outside Macy's when I'm running around like OJ through the  airport. 
[00:06:30]  The old OJ.  It's a freaking obstacle course every night.  And I, I barely make it every freaking night.  My heart is pumping like, like crazy.  My blood pressure goes to the roof because I don't want to wait around for the next train  if I don't make the 722.  Right.  All right.  So, I'm online at the token booth last night after the show.  And I'm a fourth guy in.  I'm like, okay, this is cool.  I can handle this.  I don't hear the train yet.  Oh, wait.  Now, here comes the train.  Ah.  Uh-oh.  Subway train is coming.  So, now I'm like, okay, I got to get my token.  I got to get through.  Okay.  Uh, line's moving fine. 
[00:07:00]  Anthony had that one idiot that has to ask for directions in front of me, the foreign  guy.  But he wasn't even, he wasn't even that bad at, uh, at this point last night.  Okay.  So, I hear the train.  So, I start stressing.  I finally get to the toll booth, Anthony.  Yeah.  The token booth.  That's, that's distracting me.  No, that's distracting me.  All right.  I'm just trying to put you in the mood.  Dude, you're good. 
[00:07:30]  You're distracting me.  All right.  So, now it's my turn to get the token.  Right.  I hear the train, but I still have time.  So, I carefully, because I don't want to piss off token guy, because they lose their minds  and then they F with you.  I swear to God they do this.  Yeah.  So, I put my $3 in for my two tokens.  I go, uh, you know, two tokens, please.  And, and the whole time I'm hearing the train arriving down below the stairway.  Still got time.  It's arriving.  Still got time.  So, just when he's about to give me my two tokens, out of nowhere, he grabs that stupid  mic inside his booth and starts screaming at the guy that was in front of me, yelling, 
[00:08:00]  did you swipe your Metro card?  Did you swipe your Metro card?  Why is he asking that?  Why he cares?  I don't know.  But, over and over again, hey, sir, you, you, did you swipe your Metro card?  Did you swipe your Metro card?  I'm like, the guy is already through.  He doesn't care about you.  What are you doing?  So, I'm still politely going, uh, uh, two tokens, please.  Two tokens.  Oh, because now time is of the essence.  Oh, yeah.  And now I hear that the train has stopped.  People are getting out.  I still can make it.  Okay?  All he has to do is take my stupid three bucks and give me two tokens. 
[00:08:30]  And at this point, I'm still very, very polite.  And he continues.  Now he's ignoring me for whatever reason.  Oh, boy.  He's not making eye contact.  Because I crossed the line.  And now, you know, he has to be the super Nazi guy.  Sir, sir, did you swipe your Metro card?  Sir, did you swipe your Metro card?  And I'm like, uh, two tokens, please.  Two tokens.  Two tokens.  Sir, did you swipe your Metro card?  Right here, sir.  My train.  Sir.  My train.  Did you swipe your Metro card?  That's exactly what was going on. 
[00:09:00]  And he's not even looking at you?  So then I raise my voice.  Mother.  Wrong thing to do.  I go, I need two tokens.  Yeah.  Now I'm losing it.  Because now I know I have literally seconds.  Ethnic background.  Quickly.  He was a Muslim, Anthony.  Oh, some type of Muslim dude?  Without a doubt, he was a Muslim.  You probably look a little too all-American for him.  So now I raise my voice.  Mm-hmm.  Now, just like the soup Nazi, because I go, come on, tokens.  My train's leaving.  Right?  Yeah.  He goes, no tokens for you. 
[00:09:30]  No tokens for you.  That was the wrong thing to say to me last night.  No tokens for you.  And then points to the machine.  You get your tokens over there.  That's when I yelled, you are an effing douchebag.  Oh, and you said the F word.  And then started punching the token booth, trying to get at him.  That'll work.  It was a one-two combo.  Boom, boom.  Kick.  Boom again.  I just start losing my effing mind.  I'm like, give me my effing tokens.  How many people behind you now? 
[00:10:00]  About four or five.  So he goes, no tokens for you again.  But now he's raising his voice.  Now I hear my train, my subway train, it's gone.  It's gone.  Now I'm like, okay.  Not only did I miss the subway train, now I'm guaranteed to miss my effing train from Penn Station.  To Long Island, right?  I freaking lose it.  I go, go eff your show.  But now you got time to screw with the guy.  Oh, yeah.  I go, give me my effing tokens, you douchebag.  Some freedom there.  Now I'm getting more and more pissed off, okay?  I punch the token booth again. 
[00:10:30]  He goes, no token for you.  And he goes, I'm calling cop.  And he starts looking around for a cop.  I'm like, go ahead, call a cop.  I don't give a flying F.  Oh, man.  So I go, I'll just stand here.  Give me my token.  Now there's a whole line behind me.  Now these people are getting really pissed off because they need their tokens.  I'm like, I'm not leaving.  Give me my freaking token.  Right.  So he finally realizes he better give me my tokens because these other people are losing  their mind and there's no cop around.  Right.  Thank God.  Because I would have been arrested and I definitely would have been in the wrong. 
[00:11:00]  So then I.  How would you have been in the wrong?  Assaulting a.  I assaulted the booth.  I was trying to get at him.  You realize how thick that glass is?  Through the glass.  Dude, Muslim rage all over him.  And then he was taunting me, you know, because I can't get at him.  Yeah.  So then I.  Goddamn Bunker Buster will get through the top of that thing with no lickety split.  Daisy Cutter.  Bunker Buster.  Daisy Cutter.  Under the little slot there.  Bastard.  So he finally gives me the tokens.  You know, I had no choice in the matter because I was causing a major scene. 
[00:11:30]  At this point, I grab my tokens and I point right in his face.  Right on the glass.  And I go.  Finger on the glass.  You, my friend, effed me tonight.  You effing effed me.  And I go.  Go eff yourself.  The F word is just flying like crazy.  And then he goes.  He goes to me.  He goes.  F you.  I go.  Oh, yeah.  I'll kill you.  Uh oh.  Correct.  Because I free.  At this point, I had it.  I go.  I'll kill you.  And he goes.  I'll kill you.  So now I step back.  I go.  Come on.  Come on.  Here I am.  I'll kill you. 
[00:12:00]  I'll kill you.  I'll kill you.  And then the look in his eyes.  Charlie Kramer.  The look in his eyes.  He had the rage at this point.  And he really wanted, you know, he really wanted a piece of me.  Right.  And he wanted to step out of his token booth.  So I make a long story short.  I'm like, all right, I got to get out of here.  I turn around.  There's 100 to 150 people all gathered to watch this scene.  Watching the scene.  That is me beating up the token booth last night.  Oh, my God.  So then I go down.  And there's no train for miles for some reason. 
[00:12:30]  Just my luck.  So I end up missing my train out of Penn Station.  Yeah.  So I'm standing on the platform.  And now everyone's coming down that saw the scene.  And they're all looking at me.  And they're, like, pointing to each other and stuff.  I'm like, I'm the big a-hole now.  I'm the out-of-control a-hole.  Look at them.  They're all looking at me like I'm a freak.  Yeah, you were the nutty guy.  And now today, my hand's effed up.  My big toe might be busted.  Beat the crap out of the booth, Anthony.  Yeah, he was exacting revenge on you. 
[00:13:00]  People speculating that he was exacting revenge on you by making the white man wait.  I was as polite as they come.  I was getting a little impatient.  Like, oh, my God.  Give me my tokens.  Here's the train.  I hear it.  Here.  You know, help me out.  Help me out.  Didn't you explain why you didn't have a MetroCard?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't have an unlimited, so it runs out every once in a while, and then you get another  one or fill it up. 
[00:13:30]  I didn't have money to fill it up.  I needed the tokens, and that's where we started.  Yeah, those people are horrible in those booths.  They really are.  They get pissed off at nothing.  They act like they're giving out pills for, like, eternal life.  Yeah.  You're there.  You know what?  The line should just move.  The line should just move.  So you get to the booth, and you ask for the tokens.  You give the money.  They give you the tokens.  You move on.  That transaction should take seconds. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  But as soon as you have any type of attitude or you speak a little, you know, down at them  or any of that crap, they'll start ignoring you and make them believe they've got paperwork  to do.  Yeah.  If you're like, hey, my train's coming.  I need a token.  Right then, it's not, let me give them his tokens and make them happy and get them on  his way.  It's, let me F this guy, because my life is so miserable that I will just F this guy  and have another miserable person getting into the train.  Gorilla Boy, what's up?  Gorilla Boy. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, great white gorilla.  Don't destroy our village.  Jeff Norris, what's up?  He's not, uh...  Hey, what's up?  He's not there anymore.  Oh, I can hear him.  Maybe he'll call back.  Probably a bad phone.  He's got a bad phone.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Two things to say.  Yeah.  Number one, never underestimate the power of the psycho factor.  And number two, crinkle, crinkle.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Crinkle.  Always funny.  No, you know, but I will admit it today, I have an anger problem. 
[00:15:00]  Because then I'm on the platform, and I'm sitting there going, oh my God, what did I just do?  I just tried to beat up a token booth.  Yeah.  Not a token booth guy.  I was beating up the token booth.  You know what you do?  You go down there, right?  You put your money on a pork chop, and you slide it under and go, got my tokens?  Got my tokens?  It's right there on the big piece of pork.  Gorilla Boy, what's up? 
[00:15:30]  Sorry, my phone was garbage.  I just want to give you some advice, Ope.  You've got to take anger management.  Take it from me, man.  A terroristic threat is $5,000 cash bail and a restraining order.  Terroristic threat?  What was that?  No, I didn't.  Ope threatened them.  You can't do that.  I did that a couple times.  You get the cops, and you get a $5,000 cash bail.  You follow through on it, though.  Sometimes.  You're fantastic.  Oh, great white gorilla.  That's it. 
[00:16:00]  You've got to watch.  You've got to try to plan everything.  Do what I do.  I buy all my crap at 2 in the morning when no one's around.  All right, Gorilla Boy.  Thank you.  Be calm, mate.  All right.  Here's to you.  You can get fined and arrested for just saying I'll kill you to somebody.  Here's Bob, a token collector in New York City.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, how are you guys?  Great show.  Thanks.  You guys are doing a bank up job.  This is a couple weeks before I saw you on TV.  Yeah.  And who's the blonde guy?  Oh.  We saw you guys a mile away.  Coming down those steps.  Yeah.  So what? 
[00:16:30]  You're in a hurry.  Bob, you're a token collector and you spot guys like me a mile away.  So we see you coming.  You're all nervous.  You're running.  You're in a hurry.  You're antsy.  Right?  That's what you are.  Yeah.  So why?  You're looking around, looking around.  All right.  And someone's dropping a token so you can grab it and run.  But so why do you F with us?  Because we can.  Ah.  You guys are the biggest douchebags.  You have the easiest job in New York City.  Why F with the people that are in a hurry after a long day at work and they need a token  and all of a sudden you guys act like you have the most important job in New York City? 
[00:17:00]  It's ridiculous.  It is important.  We keep you guys moving.  No, you guys don't.  You just have to run.  I've never seen a line at the token booth move.  Well, first of all, do you ever see a line?  You ever see a line and you're going uptown?  I see a line all the effing time.  The lines are ridiculous.  There's usually two guys in there.  There's never two guys working.  Let me give you a little word of advice.  You're on Lexington lines.  And you guys got huge attitudes. 
[00:17:30]  And you want to go downtown at 8 in the morning.  Run across the street to the uptown side and get your token and then come right around.  You might wait two or three people.  It doesn't matter what token booth you go to.  Even if there's only two people in front of you, he was there on time.  He could have made it if the guy didn't shove it back at him.  The guy decided that it wasn't important to help a fellow citizen of New York out.  Because at first I was very, very nice.  Very nice.  And I'm like, hey, I need a token. 
[00:18:00]  That's my train.  And he thought it was more important to yell at a guy because he didn't swipe his card.  Because the guy couldn't figure out how to swipe his card.  That's not my problem.  You know, don't forget those cards.  We don't like those cards.  Whatever, Bob.  You got the easiest job in New York City.  It's not that easy.  We got a lot of money.  Oh, it's so hard to count to ten.  You ever have like 50 tokens in your hand?  You got to count them really fast?  Wow.  That's that easy.  Wow, you got to count 50 tokens in your hand.  Yeah, well, you know, I'm missing like a...  You guys got the biggest effing attitudes.  I'm missing a digit finger. 
[00:18:30]  I would love to know how much money you guys make for that ridiculous job.  I'm missing a digit finger.  It's hard to count.  Please shut up.  Uh, Bluto, what's up?  Oh, you are so right.  These guys are stupid.  You give them $2 for a token, you know, we get the change?  Eight nickels and two dimes.  Why can't we replace them with like the...  Bluto, I'm convinced they do that crap on purpose, too.  No one wants dimes and nickels in this day and age.  Right.  A token's $1.50, you give two, but they purposely find the dimes and the nickels, because then 
[00:19:00]  that's even a hassle.  You know why?  It makes it easier.  You give them 50 cents with like four nickels.  It's easier for them to count out the drawer at the end of their shift when all of their  nickels and dimes are gone.  And why can't we replace them with the New Jersey pants turnstiles like that?  They take money?  They have a lot of salaries there.  Yeah, those people, that job is so obsolete, man.  It really is.  You tell me you have an easier job than a guy that has to give you tokens in this city.  That is the easiest job, and they have the worst attitude.  No sense of urgency, nothing. 
[00:19:30]  They could give a flying crap about you, and we're their supervisors to, you know, make  them move a little faster.  You can't.  You can't.  There's nobody that can make them move.  It's some kind of union.  All right, you guys suck, man.  T-bone rules.  It's more about the attitude they give you.  If you ask any questions or...  Did you just hear that guy?  Like, the attitude he had?  He had this, ha-ha, we'll do it.  Oh, we see you guys coming a mile away.  We'll see you on the unemployment line when your job becomes obsolete, douchebag.  Jason, you're next to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:20:00]  What's up?  What's up, Owen?  Hey.  That last guy wasn't an example, but have you guys noticed, like, an overall attitude  from all Muslims?  I know I have.  I definitely...  I was almost killed by a taxi driver.  The guy looked right at me and swerved right at me.  Jason, I'll tell you one thing.  This guy was definitely a Muslim, but I didn't even go there.  I mean, I was beyond pissed off.  I started beating up the token booth.  And, oh, it crossed my mind.  I had a few things I wanted to say.  Choice epithets in your repertoire. 
[00:20:30]  Well, that's why I know I was under control just a little bit, because I was ready to  break out some slurs, my friend.  I'm not a racist, and I know you guys are not racist either.  And I just want to say that I've definitely noticed it.  Huh.  Definitely out there.  There's, like, the Muslim crowd is...  I haven't noticed.  No one out?  You guys haven't?  No, not really.  I noticed a lot of the cabbies have taken their turbans off and put the American flag  on their cabs.  That's about it.  I haven't noticed any backlash, something negative.  Also, speaking of attitudes, call Sixth at Rocco and Maddie. 
[00:21:00]  Call online to think that's weak.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  So weak.  You can get that on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  He's giving out phone numbers.  Yeah, I know.  I just hear phone numbers.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, listen.  Two things.  One way, the fastest way to get back at a token guy, put a gallon of gasoline through  that little slot and just light it up.  Oh, Jesus.  You know, that has happened in this city before.  I know.  No one's advocating that.  No, it's kind of stupid.  Are you insane?  You wind up in prison. 
[00:21:30]  Ah, that's no big deal.  Listen, another thing.  Well, it's another one of those things that, you know, it's another one of those situations  where I don't shed any tears.  Hey.  I go, you know, I would never.  It's a horrible thing and no one should ever do that.  Yeah, basically because their family has to suffer by having one of their a-hole relatives  killed in such a horrid fashion.  Yeah.  But that and those, the black car drivers, you know what I mean?  The big livery cab, the town car drivers.  Not the black car drivers.  No, the guys that drive the black.  The big livery.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Livery cars.  The big Lincolns and stuff like that.  Hey, one more thing.  I can't stand the news.  Taxi ride to Long Island, 40 bucks.  Subway token, $1.50.  Watching Opie assaulting a subway booth.  Priceless.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  You don't like those guys either, right?  No, no.  They can't drive.  That means.  Yeah.  Oh, people are making all kinds of suggestions.  Next time, this guy says, next time just blow some baby powder under the coin slot. 
[00:22:30]  No, you don't.  Believe me, you would be thrown in jail so fast.  And a little private message to that douchebag.  I'm going a different way home tonight, so I guarantee he has a cop waiting for me tonight.  It was that much of a scene last night.  Step right up.  Step right up.  Josh, what's going on?  What's up, O&I?  Hey.  Two things.  You've got to smoke some weed, man.  Calm down.  I'm going to go back to smoke and weed.  I think you should, man.  Relax your inner tension there.  Second thing, a couple years ago, before they put those Easy Pass boots on the Garden State Parkway, 
[00:23:00]  the public collectors there are just as bad, if not worse.  Coming up the parkway, stuck in traffic, Friday afternoon, middle of the summer, July, you know the traffic.  Absolutely outrageous.  I pull up to the booth.  I had no change in me a $50 bill.  I had a whole cup full of pennies.  I give the pennies to the guy.  I give them to his hand.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty bad, dude.  He drops the pennies, and they go, I have no more money.  He goes, well, you can't go through the token.  So I take another handful of pennies, I throw them at the booth, and I just took off. 
[00:23:30]  Well, that kind of sucks, I'm handing them pennies.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  Hey, it's still money.  I mean, there's a little sign that says, no pennies, please, but it doesn't say we do not accept pennies.  Oh, God.  It says, no pennies, please, as well.  All right, dude.  We've got to stick with, you know.  No, the toll booth guys have their own problems to deal with, because drivers are a-holes.  Believe me.  Drivers are douchebags.  They will pull up there, not have their money ready, not have money at all,  throw it, and it goes on the ground when they're supposed to hit the basket. 
[00:24:00]  Now, somebody's got to come out.  You know, that's why I got easy pass.  I don't even deal with people anymore.  The more modern conveniences that can keep me from dealing with people, oh, I'm in heaven.  The better you're at.  I'm in heaven.  Ass man, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Not to fame the token clerks, but I am a trans worker, and they have no incentive to move.  I mean, just no incentive.  They're already at work.  I mean, sorry.  Yeah, you can't say that.  The fans don't give a care. 
[00:24:30]  They don't care.  They don't care.  That's obvious, and they like effing with people.  I mean, this is for a while, but last night it finally came to a head, and I beat up a token booth.  Yeah, did he go on disability?  Convex 45,000 a year.  Thanks.  All right, Ass man.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, I have no, there's no love lost with those people.  Goddamn token booth people, and they have bulletproof thrones.  When you're in a job where you got to sit like that, there's a reason for it, because you're a jackass. 
[00:25:00]  Jason, you're next to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Jason.  What's up, jackass?  What's up?  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Why do you insist on saying he stands online rather than in line?  That old gag.  Have we gotten to that?  Well, because there's an imaginary line on the ground, so I'm standing on it.  Online.  You can get online. 
[00:25:30]  You don't say get in line.  You can get in the queue.  Why are we even arguing this?  How could you be in line if, let's say, the line is only two people, you and another person?  How are you now in line, douche?  Hey, Opie.  Why don't you?  I love when they don't get their thing out.  It leaves us wondering, but cuts them off.  I'm in heaven.  The better you're in.  Hey, turn that radio down.  Ass Man, what's up?  Yeah.  Sean.  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  Wow, they're just getting to the Ass Man phone call on the air?  Wow.  Yeah.  That is some delay.  It's a pretty good delay out here in Philly.  We did that call yesterday.  No, what's up, Sean?  See, what I'm wondering here is, what are you gunning for every nationality now, Opie?  You beat up one French guy who's underwater.  They're going to beat up one Arab toll booth collector.  What's next here?  I didn't get to the toll booth collector.  It's a token booth guy.  He was very safe behind that glass.  Did you shoot for Korean shopkeepers or something next? 
[00:26:30]  We watch you.  You tried to steer.  They're always watching the black guys in those Korean stores.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  I'm out of here.  You guys suck.  Bye.  All right.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I know what those guys make.  How much?  They make over $20 an hour.  They make over $20 an hour?  Are you kidding me?  Sitting in a token booth.  For the easiest job in New York City?  It's the easiest job in any city.  Are you kidding?  They're way overpaid and they have major attitudes. 
[00:27:00]  How do I get a job like that?  There are people humping materials in construction and whatnot that don't even make that.  You're horrible.  True stuff, guys.  True stuff.  Take it easy.  You guys suck.  All right.  You tell me a job that's easier than handing out tokens in New York City.  Yeah.  You can't think of it.  Easiest.  All right.  We better take a break, huh?  Jack answers.  And get to our show today.  Shut up, Ben.  At least I admit my problems. 
[00:27:30]  We'll take a break and we'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony show.  What do you do here?  Look, look, look at breasts.  If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow sticker just trolling for breasts.  Thank you, Howard.  Oh, yeah.

The problem you had with the token guy, the subway token guy yesterday, punching his bulletproof booth trying to get at him.  John says you're like a Denunzio from Caddyshack.  I ain't paying 50 cents for no coke.  Hey, then you ain't getting no coke, huh?  Open the door. 
[00:30:00]  Open the door, Noonan.  I wanted him to open his door so bad yesterday.  Here it is.  Also, Al Mack saying, Newsflash, November 14, 2001, 3.20 p.m.  Opie admits he has an anger problem.  November 14, 2001, 3.37 p.m.  Opie goes off on a caller.  It seems to be working well.  Well, it makes me feel better, Ed.  What did I tell you?  This one, first motor vehicle, now the token guy.  Who is Opie taking on next?  You never punched anyone there. 
[00:30:30]  Well, no, a guy punched my car.  I remember when the guy punched your vehicle, but that started because you hit him.  And took out my whole side view mirror.  We used to.  All like he didn't deserve it.  It was in a crosswalk.  It wasn't like, I don't know, no.  Those of you that might have misunderstood this, it wasn't Opie bumped his car.  Opie hit him.  It was in a crosswalk.  We used to commute in together, so I'm in the passenger seat.  Opie's driving.  We're in Midtown. 
[00:31:00]  And there was traffic on the other side of the intersection.  We had the green light, but there's traffic.  And you don't want to block the bus.  We had the green light.  We had the green light.  But you don't want to block the box.  So we couldn't go right away, but we were going to go very soon.  You get a ticket if you stopped in the box when it turns red.  But it was green.  And Opie stopped just in case the traffic across the intersection didn't move quickly enough.  He didn't want to be stranded in the middle of the intersection.  So people then see you stop. 
[00:31:30]  Even though it says don't walk for them, now they start crossing in front of your vehicle.  But in this case, only one guy was.  Yeah, well, no, a few people were.  Oh, they were.  The thing is, it cleared out when this gentleman was in front of your vehicle.  He wasn't moving quite quickly enough for you.  So you edged up and gave him a little hip check with your bump.  Well, you're missing a few points, my friend.  I gave him every opportunity to get out of the way.  Oh, I know.  I beeped nicely a few times, and I pointed like, look, we got the green light. 
[00:32:00]  And what pissed me off and infuriated me in this situation was that he knew that I was a little bothered,  and he made sure he took his sweet time.  Exactly.  And at that point, I start inching forward.  Now, there's something to be said here, because when I'm walking around Manhattan,  there are times it says don't walk, and traffic is stopped like that, and I will walk.  But I will look and make sure I'm not going to be interfering with anybody if they can start moving. 
[00:32:30]  And other people, most people, they don't care.  Like this guy was walking across.  He didn't say, look, all right, it says don't walk.  Let me look at the flow of traffic.  Let me see if anyone that has stopped at the crosswalk is going to be able to go.  No, he just trods right along.  So he's slowing down.  Real slow.  Like that Dane Cook bit.  Yeah, it's going real slow.  Now, Ope just decides now at this point he's going to give the guy a little incentive to get out of the way. 
[00:33:00]  Well, because now I know the light's going to change soon, and you know.  Yeah, because you and I used to drive, man.  Any time we could say it was very important to our lives.  Shaving off those precious seconds.  Shaving 30 seconds here.  If it means going up on a sidewalk, Anthony.  I've done that.  All right.  I know.  I'm not the only one that's a little crazy in the brain when driving.  Proud of my sidewalk driving.  So you gave him a little incentive and bumped his, you hip checked him with your grill and bumper of your, you had a blazer at the time.  So what does the guy do?  Most guys would probably be pretty scared by that and maybe run away. 
[00:33:30]  Well, I was pissed because he walked up to my window.  Yeah, he walked up to where Anthony was.  I'm like, hey, look at me, no steering wheel, jackass.  And started beating the crap out of my car.  He took out the side view mirror.  He gave your side view mirror a right hook and it broke it off of your door.  It was on my old car, the S10 Blazer.  So, you know, they had all the wiring and stuff.  Yes, it was just hanging by the adjustment wires.  All the wires and stuff.  And then he started punching the window.  Yeah.  That didn't break, thank God. 
[00:34:00]  I'm like, hey, hey.  So what did I do?  Being the tough guy that I am?  Well, you got to make the light.  Step on the gas, man.  I was the biggest pussy, man.  Well, what are you going to do?  I hip checked the guy.  He beats my car up, breaks it.  So now that means we have to fight, right?  Oh, no.  You know what?  It was a smart move because.  He called my bluff and I just sat there like a pussy, man.  You know how quickly, if you got out of the car and the cops showed up, that guy would  have been on the ground going, my hip, he hit me. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, we're lucky.  Yeah, we got through that light.  But I did hit a guy.  Sue you.  Mike from the NYPD.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, how you doing, ONA?  All right.  I just want to let you know that they treat the cops like garbage also.  Who?  The clerks, the token booth clerks.  Oh, really?  Yeah, so you don't have to feel bad about that.  If we're going in to help one of our fellow officers, they won't buzz us through the gates.  What?  We're screaming at them to buzz us through the gates. 
[00:35:00]  They're making us jump over the turnstiles.  So what is their problem?  I've known his attitudes with these guys for a long time.  And it finally, like I said, it finally came to a head last night.  Right, right.  Well, we get them back for you.  Don't worry.  We had a couple of my buddies.  They pulled over one of the clerks.  And, you know, they recognized him.  They gave him a ticket for the broken taillight.  They go to the station to meet him at the station to do a, it's a revenue escort.  We take him from one token booth to the next.  Yeah.  It's the same clerk.  I mean, he wouldn't come out of the booth to go with the two cops. 
[00:35:30]  So, yeah, we take care of them.  I don't know what their problem is.  They're uptight about something.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  All right.  Alexa from the city.  You can smell the black lady's breath through the booth opening at 15th and Union Square East Station every evening.  It's so nasty.  She's the biggest bitch of them all, too.  No shame.  You ever see that, though?  You're getting a token, and you can smell the person's breath through the bulletproof booth. 
[00:36:00]  I don't know what it smells like in there.  Man.  Oh.  Hey, Brett, what's up?  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  How does it feel to be so perfect?  What do you mean?  Oh, man.  Yo, everybody, go see Jim Norton in Vegas to start us with Andrew Dice Clay and Brett Neva.  What is he doing?  I don't get it.  What was that?  How does it feel to be so perfect?  Yeah, I'm obviously perfect.  I have serious problems, and I know it. 
[00:36:30]  Don't you just want to reach through the phone and choke him?  But after I beat the crap out of inanimate objects, it makes me feel much better.  Does it?  I swear to God.  Yeah.  Especially if you hurt your hand.  No.  I don't want to admit too much.  The more pain, the better I feel.  When I'm raging, and then I beat up stuff, it's never people, unless they're underwater.  And then my hand is, I've broken this hand a couple times, punching stuff, or fractured it. 
[00:37:00]  And I feel much better, the more pain that I feel.  I've thrown things out of my vehicle.  I swear to God.  At cabs.  That doesn't make sense.  And those town cars and stuff.  I have literally taken half full bottles of Snapple that I was enjoying on my drive home,  and thrown them at back windows of these vehicles.  I cannot even take it.  Any spare change.  I look, I'm like, I get all freaked out.  And I'm just, I'm foraging through my little console, trying to find something to throw at people. 
[00:37:30]  And sometimes it's just not heavy enough.  I'm like, no, I can't throw that.  A pen.  What's a pen going to do?  And then if I have a half-filled bottle of Snapple, I hit a back window of one of those town cars once,  and it just went, it hit the trunk and went, poosh, like all over the window.  But I felt so much better just knowing, it's all sticky.  I cannot get the dope.  People wonder why I have a problem with those guys.  They aren't like cabs.  Cabs have their own problems.  But at least cabs are aggressive, and they're moving. 
[00:38:00]  It's very rare.  It happens that you get behind a cab, though, that isn't kind of moving.  It's not like a cab is in my way.  Those goddamn town cars cannot move.  They will get out of the middle lane for no apparent reason to get into left lane right when you're coming up to pass them  and do 50 in a 55 or do 40 driving in Midtown.  You're trying to get around them, and they are taking up two lanes,  driving right on the dotted white line just in case one lane opens up a little bit. 
[00:38:30]  I cross over the double yellow.  I get right next to them and move them right back into his lane.  That's the problem I have with those sons of bitches, and I throw things at them.  You know what I used to put in my glove compartment, Anthony?  Yeah, golf balls.  Golf balls.  I swear to God, I stopped doing that.  Yeah, those work.  I used to throw them at cars as they were going off.  Hoo-hoo-hoo. 
[00:39:00]  Ouch.  Yeah, we just got some interesting news in the studio.  Too bad.  All right, anyway.  All kidding aside, though, Ant,  what do you want to say?  I'm not kidding.  Here in New York City, I'm surprised more people don't die because of road rage.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I'm not the only one talking, and Ant's not the only one talking.  There's a ton of people listening to us right now that can relate.  We are very high strung here in New York City when it comes to driving and commuting, 
[00:39:30]  because it's, and especially now, it's just gotten to the point where you can't get anywhere  without sitting in a lot of traffic.  If there's one slight problem in Manhattan, it screws up all of Manhattan.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  They close a couple roads, and everyone is screwed.  And lately, they've been closing a few roads.  I'm just amazed that there aren't more problems.  People are just losing their minds.  When the usual just road closure problem is compounded with people that pull bonehead moves,  it gets me so pissed off that I've got to throw things. 
[00:40:00]  I've had, who hasn't had, like, a girlfriend just yell at you?  She has grabbed my hand as I am ready to wing something out the window and go,  stop it, you're going to get yourself killed.  Like, I don't care.  I'll take me getting killed.  I've got to throw something at this guy.  All right.  Bastards.  It's like someone's having a worse day than us today.  Ah, Jim, what's going on? 
[00:40:30]  Hey, ONA, how you guys doing?  All right, bro.  Listen, I'm a New York City Transit Authority employee myself.  I'm a track worker, and I deal with these token booth carts all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're the biggest, like, a-holes you've ever friggin' overpaid pieces of garbage you've ever met  because they sit there, and they don't do anything, and part of my job, I'll go down there at night.  I work at night, and me and a whole gang of guys will go down there,  and we'll have, like, handfuls of tools and stuff like that, and they won't buzz us through the friggin' gate. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I've noticed three things.  They're overpaid, they have major attitudes, and they obviously have job security  because it doesn't matter, you know, what kind of job performance they have.  They keep their jobs.  It's, like, the hardest thing in the world for them to reach over and push a goddamn button.  Right.  You know, to open that gate.  Right.  It's the worst thing in the world, man.  All right, Jim, thank you.  Thanks a lot.  All right, I think we made our point with these guys, right?  Tom, what's up?  Tommy!  Tom!  Hello!  Hello! 
[00:41:30]  Hello!  All right, let's move on to other things.  Let's see what Ken has for the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, Ken?  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  We're hanging.  I just wanted to start talking about the Michael Jackson special last night.  Oh, God.  Did you see any of this?  Well, I saw it this morning because I had to watch, you know, the second episode of 24.  Oh, God.  Gee, I'm going to wait until halfway through the season when it gets light out.  I am not.  I cannot watch that goddamn show, 24.  You don't like 24? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, my God.  I like the 24.  It's different.  It's not realistic.  First of all, where's the call from his friend?  Hey, man, what's up?  Nothing.  What are you doing?  Nothing, man.  Just calling.  What are you doing?  Yeah, it's 24 hours in a day.  Where are the inane things that happen to everybody on any given day?  Has he taken a leak yet?  Have we seen him take a leak yet?  I think that stuff happens during commercials.  Oh, is that it?  Because the clock is still running.  So they break for commercial two minutes. 
[00:42:30]  Geez, I didn't know.  They could be taking the leak and getting that phone call from their friend.  I can't take it.  I don't like 24.  I like it.  We are, you know.  I like anything different on TV.  I don't know.  I have given up on sitcoms because of the same old crap.  I just go.  I resign myself to the old time.  I'll turn the honeymooners on.  I don't care.  You don't like it?  I can't.  It looks like, this looks like something right up your alley, Anthony.  A lot of action, a lot of killing and explosion.  I can't take the split screen.  I'm looking over.  I can't take it. 
[00:43:00]  The chick is hot.  Yeah.  I get confused.  I'm sitting there going in with those two guys.  Oh, this is like two hours after I watched last week.  A week has gone by in my life.  I can't relate to the fact that it's, you know, a matter of minutes past what I watched last week.  The guys gave one of the hot chicks a roofie and they're bummed.  They didn't give the blonde the roofie as well.  So when do we have to, how long do we have to wait until it takes effect?  Three weeks?  They're two hours into it.  No, they're into it.  They're two hours into a roofie?  Oh, the roofie?  No, yeah.  How long does it take to take a roofie to take effect? 
[00:43:30]  All right, listen.  They slipped the one girl a roofie and they banged her in the furniture store.  And they didn't give the blonde the roofie.  And now something's going on because they're pretty much kidnapping them.  Right.  But it was great.  I watched the show.  We got Psycho Mark here.  It's nothing he hasn't done before.  We're two hours in.  We got 22 hours to go to see what happens.  22 hours.  Ooh, I can't wait.  Yeah, but one of the guys took a crowbar to the other chick's arm to make the other girl make a phone.  You really don't like 24?  I'm really surprised.  Nah, I don't like the whole... 
[00:44:00]  I really thought you would be hooked on the 24.  Gimmicky.  It's too gimmicky for me.  I'm an NYPD Blue kind of guy.  What about the plane exploding with the lady getting out with the parachute and stuff?  I was relevant.  Yeah, it was, you know.  That was kind of cool to watch.  All right.  She puts the plastic explosive around the door.  Kind of hangs out and gets sucked out the plane.  By the way, we got a copy of the unedited version of that.  Oh, there's a little more going on that they cut out because of the situation.  The whole plane thing, they really chopped down to absolutely nothing. 
[00:44:30]  Really?  They didn't want to offend anyone.  Oh, why?  What was in there that could have been bad?  Well, you know, America right now is very sensitive to plane crashes, obviously.  But, I mean, so they cut out this whole elaborate scene and only gave you a very small part of it.  It was pretty quick.  Yeah.  We got the advanced tape way before, so we had it.  What, did they fill it in with the...  I don't know.  No, they probably chopped about two minutes out of that scene.  It was much more intense. 
[00:45:00]  But, anyway, Ken.  Yeah.  What's up?  So, hey, the Michael Jackson.  How low does Flash's career have to sink when he gets a call from Michael Jackson and answers that one?  Oh, how?  They did two songs with him, and then Michael Jackson goes over and he's acting like he's going to play the guitar with Flash and everything.  That was probably one of the lamest, most douche-chilly specials I've ever seen.  And every single section of it was ridiculous, whether they were concentrating on the stage, Michael, the audience was, oh, my God, full of frightening people singing along with Michael's songs, completely forgetting that this guy was up on child molestation charges. 
[00:45:30]  Well, there was a bunch of things going on.  You see Whitney Houston in the beginning?  Bag of bones?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The sack of bones, Whitney.  That was disgusting.  Boy, good job, Bobby.  Good job, Bobby Brown.  You really fixed her up good.  You skanked her up nice. 
[00:46:00]  Skanked her up real good with your drugs, didn't you?  That...  She was such a piece of ass.  But I have a Bobby Brown.  Now she looks like one of those used whores.  Yeah.  She's a friggin' tunnel bunny crack whore.  That's a $5 Hummer special right there.  Hey, I kept pushing back and forth between...  Man, I was so young.  You see a lot of Whitney Houston's on Straight Path down there in Wine Dash.  A $5 Hummer special.  Brentwood. 
[00:46:30]  Look at me getting local for Long Island.  What up?  Wine Dash.  I used to have to drive through Wine Dash, Long Island, when I was coming back from Opie's  show there at BAB at night.  Remember the gang fight that we had to stop the cars and wait until all the shooting was  done?  Until I drove my work van.  I used to work, as you remember, for Apollo air conditioning out there on Long Island.  And I would take the van.  Wasn't supposed to do this, but oops.  I would take the van to a band rehearsal, which was in an area that I had to drive right 
[00:47:00]  down Straight Path Road in Wine Dash.  I'm coming home one day, and a crowd of young black men were running across the street, across  Straight Path.  I locked the brakes up on the van.  Man, I was behind you that night.  Yeah.  I hear, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.  They're gunfire.  Gunshots.  And a crowd surge.  I'm on the floor of my van, and then I peek up and just gasp it. 
[00:47:30]  They're having a huge rumble in the middle of the street.  With gunfire.  I rolled down my window, and I asked a passerby, what's going on?  They're like, oh, it's just a little gang situation.  You rolled your window, but all you saw was the back of my van getting real small, real  quick, because I wasn't stopping.  There were red lights.  There's a train crossing there.  I'd have gone through it.  Yeah, you would have done a hooper.  Went down.  Screw it.  I was not stopping.  That is one heinous little neighborhood they got there.  Anyway, Whitney Houston looks like she could do the $5 special on Straight Path. 
[00:48:00]  So, what do you think, Ken?  Well, I kept switching back and forth between the Dateline Exorcism special and that, and  I don't know what was most scary.  Oh, we forgot the Exorcism special.  I got on tape, dude.  You got on tape with the guy.  I saw the commercial where the guy's freaking out.  Just freaking out totally.  That's a kook.  That looked like an older Johnny Cash.  Well, there were a few things going on with the Michael Jackson special.  I hope everyone realized that he was lip syncing.  He kept covering his mouth to cover himself. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, I don't know what was going on.  Michael Jackson, every song he sang, he was covering his mouth.  He had his hand over his mouth, and he'd have either a wireless, he had a headset at  one point, he was doing the same thing, and then even with a regular mic, he would cup  it and put his hand over his mouth.  And after a while, I noticed, I go, stinky, look at his mouth.  It's like a Fred Flintstone mouth, you know?  You look at Fred, and he's got that brownish color razor stubble thing.  He was getting that.  He was rubbing off whatever white makeup he puts on to cover up that vitiligo, I guess, 
[00:49:00]  he's got.  Well, that's the excuse.  That's the excuse.  I just believe this guy doesn't want to be a black man, and he'll go to great lengths  skin bleaching and putting makeup all over his face.  Because you see him, did you see him singing and dancing with his brothers?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was like, I didn't know what that was.  It was a white guy, a white alien, dancing with the Jackson 5.  They're blood brothers.  You guys were right on when he called them a geisha girl.  They are from the same mother and father. 
[00:49:30]  A kabuki.  A kabuki doll.  From the same mother and overbearing father.  Did anyone else notice?  And you've got to be careful with this stuff, because people are going to be pissed, but  I'm going to say it.  What?  Did you notice the plate under his nose that made this part of his upper lip stick out?  Well, a lot of ladies do that.  They get collagen injections to make their lips more full, because people have said Michael  Jackson lost his lips.  And he did.  He used to have those big lips, big full lips, when he was a young Michael Jackson with the 
[00:50:00]  Jackson 5.  He had traditional African features.  He did.  Nice.  And now he looks like a spaceman.  What happened?  You see all the other guys?  You see all the other Jackson 5?  They grew up.  They look all distinguished and everything.  A little touch of gray on the sides.  And Michael Jackson is a freak.  What happened to his Chuck Webner nose?  I'm just trying to mention Chuck Webner as many days in a row as possible.  That's two. 
[00:50:30]  He looks like a freak.  So then all of a sudden, he's rubbing his mouth, because he's covering his mouth as he's  singing, and he's rubbing off any of that makeup that's on his face.  So I think he goes home, he could wash his face, and he could be brown-skinned.  But he just decides to slather this stuff on.  And be a white gal.  And what about all the pussies that share the stage with him?  A bunch of phonies in Hollywood, and a lot of them in the music business.  Now, I would confront the guy in front of everybody in the garden. 
[00:51:00]  What's up with you and the kids?  Like he's going to say anything.  Whatever, but instead they're all kissing his ass like he's the greatest thing since sliced bread.  You want it spelt out for you?  I'll tell you what's with me and the kids.  I like me and the kids.  That's good.  Marianne, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you today?  Good.  That show last night, that Michael Jackson special, just like you said, Opie, it was the biggest freak festival. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Did you guys, what did you think of Liza Minnelli?  Oh, I miss Liza Minnelli.  Holy Christ.  Do we have any clips from this?  I would really love a Liza clip.  We can grab that.  Yeah, grab the Liza Minnelli.  I know we said that we don't really want to play any of the clips, but that one's got to be good.  I saw Liz Taylor sitting next to Michael Jackson.  Yeah, what was up with that purple boa?  And Macaulay Calkin.  Oh, yeah, his first victim.  Jesus, his first celebrity child victim. 
[00:52:00]  And the madam.  They all got to talk about how, well, I sat with Michael for quite a while, and we have  so much in common.  We're both, we both didn't have a childhood.  Him and Macaulay.  Macaulay always talks about that.  And then that other one.  Who was that other kid that was his favorite?  Nah.  Was it before or after Webster?  The one of the, Corey Feldman.  Oh, Corey Feldman.  Little Corey Feldman, another one.  We both didn't, anyone who didn't have a childhood can go up and sit on Mikey's lap. 
[00:52:30]  And, oh, yeah.  You could sing like Michael.  Sing into my microphone.  Liza was horrible.  She looked like she had about 14 pounds of plastic surgery as well.  She looked exactly like Michael Jackson with the dark black hair, the white skin, the red,  red lips.  Very bony looking.  And I'll tell you, her hair is the longest I've ever seen it.  She's always had that short, dikey type of haircut. 
[00:53:00]  She looked like she had a black wig on.  You know something?  His whole posse, they should just play goddamn circus music behind him when they drag him  out.  They got that.  They got that.  Step right off.  Ladies and gentlemen.  And they're all starting to look like them, too.  The most grotesque collection of freaks you have ever seen.  They got that, what's her name?  The big fat one, Liz Taylor.  Liz Taylor with that fake wig that she got on because now she's bald as a cue ball. 
[00:53:30]  We're watching the Michael Jackson morphing picture right here on the internet.  Oh, my God.  Look at him.  Get Steve to put that on foundrymusic.com.  Oh, my gosh.  That is just scary.  One more time?  Ah, yeah.  Well, wow.  Is that freaky?  They go all the way from when he was a little kid on the Jackson 5, and then when he was  on stage last night, and he's trying to do the Jackson 5 songs?  Let's do this like we did it on the Ed Sullivan show. 
[00:54:00]  I saw that part.  What?  When you were black?  Right.  Too late.  Can't do it.  Does your father get to beat you before you come on stage?  All right, Marianne.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Sorry, Michael.  You don't have the range of a 12-year-old boy anymore.  They are trying.  No matter how many of them in your bed.  They are trying so hard to revive this guy's career.  It is so over.  It's not even funny.  Yeah.  His album got bumped now.  Was that number one for what?  One week?  Britney bumped it.  Now it's in third place.  Pink Floyd's greatest hits is beating out Michael Jackson's brand new album. 
[00:54:30]  It's over.  I mean, they can parade as many celebrities as they want in front of this crowd of Madison  Square Garden.  It is so over, and they're pulling out all the stops to try to save this.  Ah, so done.  Are they canceling his TV show?  Oh, Michael Jackson.  Okay, sorry.  No, that was who we were talking about.  What is that?  An install.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  When did Michael ever do an in-store or one of those big publicity things where they 
[00:55:00]  close down Times Square?  He is just a freakazoid.  And that big, fat Marlon Brando, they cut out his child abuse speech.  That banner highlight moment of the festivities.  I want to see that.  I want to see that.  The horror.  The horror.  The horror.  Ryan, what's going on?  It's a freak show.  Hey, I think that him, Brando, McCauley, and Liz should start a side show.  Oh, wait.  It cost $2,000 a ticket.  I forgot.  Yeah.  Step right up for $2,000. 
[00:55:30]  And then did you see some of the guys in the audience singing along?  We were laughing.  We stopped and rewound one guy five times in the office.  We called him Big Fat Jewish Guy.  He was on the screen for, it had to be two seconds at the most.  But we were like, rewind it.  It's Big Fat Jewish Guy.  Hi, I'm David Rosenbaum.  And I'm here at Michael Jackson.  And he's doing the little dance. 
[00:56:00]  He did the little, you know where you snap and throw your arm out to the side, little  Michael Jackson thing?  They caught him in the audience doing that, mouthing the words out.  Who's bad?  Who's bad?  Call my lawyer.  Who's bad?  Mutual funds.  Who's bad?  Who's bad?  Run the entertainment industry.  Who's bad?  Fred, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Him and Macaulay Culkin and Liz Taylor are sitting up in the balcony like the two old guys 
[00:56:30]  from the Muppets, acknowledging everybody.  It was the hardest thing to watch.  I'm jumping between that and that World Trade Center tragedy on the Discovery Channel.  And that was an absolute tragedy.  The Jackson performance.  Incredible.  What's more of a tragedy, 9-11 or Michael Jackson's face?  Oh, man.  Jesus.  If there wasn't death involved, it would be obvious.  And his mouth is so stretched out now.  Have you seen it? 
[00:57:00]  That it doesn't move.  He could be a ventriloquist.  Does he have mummy lips in?  He's got mummy lips.  You ever see on the Discovery Channel when they unearth those mummies and their lips are  totally gone and they're just barely covering your teeth?  It's also called the Charles Brunson.  They get the Charles Brunson face.  I dig.  I dig because I must get out.  Right.  I dig.  You still look like that Helen Bonham Carter from Planet of the Apes, too.  Yeah, but you say that and they call you racist, but I swear to God, we've all seen the picture. 
[00:57:30]  Michael Jackson on one side and Helen on the other side, split screen.  They look like they could be related, yes.  Absolutely.  Have a good day, boys.  All right, bro.  Speaking of Charles Brunson, remember, ladies, when you're doing the Hummer, we all want  you to make the Charles Brunson face to cover the teeth.  I dig because I must get out.  The woods are lovely, dark and deep.  Hey, Eric, what's up?  Oh, hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, hey.  Man, he looked like a Chinese kabuki doll last night. 
[00:58:00]  I was sitting with my wife just laughing my ass off.  Yeah.  Oh, the funny thing is, too, how many times did the guard his crotch last night?  Dude, the guy's like, he's also grabbing his penis.  Oh, I know.  He grabs his junk and then he had that hot girl come out in that little silver dress  and he's like, like he's gawking over her.  Please.  I was ready to get a Hummer last night, but I lost it.  That never works.  That, please, just have a little, have a kindergarten class go out and perform on stage. 
[00:58:30]  That'll get him hot.  That's what they should have had, like a bunch of kindergarten kids dancing around the stage.  Oh, wouldn't that be funny?  And then in post-production, they superimpose hot women there.  Yeah, to really fake.  Maybe they did that.  Maybe they just dragged some young boy out.  One of those telepans over Macaulay Culkin and asked who's your mama.  You're sitting kind of cozy last night, too.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  All right, thanks, bro.  Yes, Matthew Jackson.  You got that.  We got the Liza clip? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  All right, let's check that out.  Another, ladies and gentlemen, of The Incomparable.  Is that Steve C?  Mr. Manelli.  Mr. Manelli.  All you're saying is gone.  Oh, God.  I'm still all alone.  Mario does this to a teen, doesn't he?  How could this be?  Really?  You're not here with me. 
[00:59:30]  Really?  You're never saying goodbye.  Goodbye.  That's the cowardly lion from The Wizard of Oz.  Remember, you're a drag queen.  I leave my world so cold.  My mother's a drunk ass. 
[01:00:00]  God, Mario Cantone's got that down to a T.  Oh, God.  Is that awful?  Oh, wait.  Yeah, here's Mario.  Do we still have?  Hold on.  Let's make a comparison.  They'll hit it again?  Liza.  Oh, you're far away.  I'm here to stay. 
[01:00:30]  You are not alone.  Okay, now this is Mario.  Liza, I want to do a medley of You Are Not Alone into Over the Rainbow.  She's like, I don't sing my mother's songs.  It tears me up.  But please, for me.  Okay, I'll do it for you, Michael.  And she's going to get up and be like, you are not alone.  It's not another word.  Liza, those aren't the words. 
[01:01:00]  You are not alone.  Liza, stop.  Call me on the phone.  Leave a message at the tone.  What a mess.  And this is Liza.  Liza, Liza.  Liza, Liza, Liza. 
[01:01:30]  Berger, from Hannibal, the guy with the, like, deformed face in the bed that, like, I don't know.  Did you guys see that at all?  Yeah, the guy from Hannibal with the messed up face in the bed. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, dude, I saw it.  I was like, you've got to be kidding me.  This guy, he looks like hell.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Later, guys.  After every time.  Now, Michael Jackson is on the stage every segment of this special.  You know, every time they go to commercial, they come back, Michael Jackson.  But every time they went to spots, the announcer would come on.  And coming up, the king of pop in a performance you'll never forget. 
[01:02:30]  Coming up, the greatest entertainer of all time, Michael Jackson.  It was like the end of King of Comedy.  The wonderful Rupert Pupkin, everyone.  Rupert.  Fabulous.  Rupert Pupkin.  Ladies and gentlemen, the amazing Rupert Pupkin.  Rupert Pupkin, everyone.  Michael Jackson.  Amazing.  Michael Jackson, everyone.  Fabulous.  That movie's so underrated.  Ma!  One of the best Robert De Niro movies ever. 
[01:03:00]  King of Comedy.  I'm doing something.  Ma!  Now, Jerry.  That is the best.  It really is.  When he went to Jerry's house with the girl.  That is the best scene ever in the movie.  Jerry, I thought we'd do some work.  Jerry.  What are you doing here?  Oh, Jerry.  Now, Jerry.  And then the lady's so bummed because she's just like a trash whore.  Yeah, she thought she was actually.  Rupert doesn't even know where we were coming. 
[01:03:30]  No, no.  That's okay.  I'll call the police.  Get out of here.  Now, Jerry.  Now, Jerry.  I got the stuff here.  I figure after dinner, we'll work on this.  It's all delusional.  Mr. Langford, man here.  Won't go and won't leave.  All right.  We should take another break here.  Hey, we're doing the Xbox thing tomorrow.  Oh, I can't wait.  Cherry darts for the Xbox.  Cherry darts, Jerry. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, we're going to have a bunch of guys come down.  They're going to take cherries.  Put them in, we figured, marshmallow fluff.  Yeah.  Hopefully, we'll have a fluff another tomorrow, guys.  Yeah.  And then we're going to have a girl be the target.  You know where the bullseye is.  And the guys will have to throw their cherry darts at her target.  The closest, which I think it's going to have to be a bullseye.  I'm thinking a lot, guys.  It's going to have to be a bullseye.  We're going to have a lot of guys and girls coming down to, yeah, throw the cherry darts. 
[01:04:30]  And let's do ourselves a favor here.  Because the douchebag lawyers, their whole job is to try to F up our show.  Sure.  And figure out ways, you know, why we shouldn't do these contests that we come up with.  These brilliant contests.  Right.  We have never said where the bullseye is going to be on this lady.  Uh-huh.  And let's just keep it that way.  Exactly.  Then they have no excuse to shut us down this time around.  All right?  Right.  Our listeners could use their own imagination where the bullseye is.  We have never said it. 
[01:05:00]  So you can't shut us down.  Pricks.  Fuzzy.  All right.  We'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, Anthony.  We've got all the big clients now for The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're talking about the nose trimmer from the sharper image.  Oh, we are?  Yeah.  The turbo groomer.  All right.  Let me know about it.  What spot you got?  I have a CD radio alarm. 
[01:05:30]  But also from the shopper image.  Oh, my God.  I'm talking about the turbo groomer, Anthony.  Yes.  One of the shopper's image's most popular selling items.  Now they've introduced the turbo groomer 2.0 with two types of cutting heads.  Small handheld device with a powerful new motor.  Easily and comfortably trims nose and ear hair.  Has two interchangeable grooming blades.  Rotary blades for nose hair and tiny clippers for the ears.  Two lead headlamps help you see what the F you're doing.  Headlamps.  Cleanup is so effing easy. 
[01:06:00]  Just rinse under running water.  Safe, simple, and effing effective.  You twat.  See the turbo groomer for yourself in one of the 15 greater New York area stores or shop online at sharperimage.com.  Give them a call.  1-800-344-4444.  Are there enough F and pours in the phone number?  It's the sharper image.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:06:30]  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Washington, D.C. now has the WOW stickers, Anthony.  Yeah.  And we could not be happier.  They're doing a WOW sticker stop today, matter of fact.  Yeah.  Helping us out.  Tyson's Corner Mall, Circuit City, from 5 to 6, if you want to get your WOW bumper stickers.  All right?  WOW.  Tyson's Corner Mall, Circuit City, between 5 and 6, two days.  Tyson's Corner Mall.  Yeah.  Or you could stop by the station, I believe, WJFK, to get your WOW bumper stickers. 
[01:07:00]  And more Washington sticker stops on foundrymusic.com.  Lots of stuff about the show on foundrymusic.com.  Where's my paperwork that I brought in?  Someone had a really funny email about foundrymusic.com.  You could spend days, weeks on foundry, trolling through everything that's happened on this show.  Well, he has a lot of stuff up, Anthony.  Of course he does.  John says it all, though. 
[01:07:30]  Listen to this email.  While WNAW.com is informative and full of pictures from the show, it's just too plain.  So last night, I spent several hours trying to find my way around foundrymusic.com because I thought it was a great sight from what you guys talk about on the air.  I got so lost about an hour in that I went and made a pot of coffee and vowed to find my way out no matter how long it took.  During this process, I had 36 pop-up windows appear on my screen with scores of young naked women. 
[01:08:00]  Bonus.  Each time I closed one, another would pop up.  Annoying.  I also had an opportunity to purchase various items from Shrek, a kid's movie, to The Ultimate Guide to A-Sex.  Yeah.  Will they let that fly?  I think you could actually say a book, The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex. 
[01:08:30]  You're not talking about it.  You're talking about the book title.  Why?  Can't say it?  Just say anal.  Anal is...  Can't say it.  Can't say anal in the ass world.  Every time they do a stupid dump, from now on, I break something in the studio.  All right.  All right.  Everyone just grab whatever's valuable to you.  That's fair, right?  Sure.  They heard our show.  We heard them back.  There you go. 
[01:09:00]  Word counts.  Their pockets.  Their wallets.  Their wallet.  Anyways, to continue John's email.  What a whore.  Is his sister up for sale, too?  Are there any other sites that would be considered a safe mix of these two?  John.  People have trouble with Foundry.  Hi, Steve.  Trying to navigate Foundry.  You didn't do anything.  Here's another listener talking about navigating Foundry music.  Bite me. 
[01:09:30]  Yes.  Bite me.  Bite me, you tools.  You shaved ape, sloped forehead, knuckle-dragging, Neanderthal idiots.  We watch...  You know, I'm tired of it.  You know?  I understand you guys goofing on it.  It's just like the...  It's a gag, whatever.  But if anybody legitimately...  Nobody legitimately has a problem navigating that effing website, you can lick me, all right?  Idiots.  You're not getting enough protein.  You all right?  No, I'm getting plenty of protein.  I wish one of them would say to my face, I can throw him off the 10th floor. 
[01:10:00]  Well, you're going to lose too much weight, and you're not going to be as intimidating soon.  I'm sorry.  How much...  Hi, Glames, y'all.  Hi.  Come here, say to my face, you pussy.  It's not hard to navigate through.  It's no harder than any Pentagon website.  If it is, I'd love to have somebody actually show me what they couldn't find.  You know, it's laziness.  I was actually saying this.  I was...  You know, I'm guilty of this myself.  I can't, like...  I'll look for something in the closet at home. 
[01:10:30]  I'll look for my deodorant, and if I don't see it within two seconds, I get...  You know, I get furious, but the fact is, I just don't want to look for it.  And that's really what it is.  It's laziness.  People don't want to look for something.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  That's my analogy.  I've put a couple of things into search engines, and nothing's come back.  Well, it might not be there.  Something might not exist, but...  All right, Steve.  All right.  Thank you for that.  Thank you.  Oh, we got a metro.  Shut up with the metro card.  Where'd that one hit?  Let me look.  Let me look.  Oh, it's a nerve. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  All right, Skinny.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Someone might die today.  I love it.  All right.  Stephen Hawking's checking and saying, Foundry's not that bad.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  Foundry's not that bad.  Monique.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Long time no hear from.  What up, Monique?  Yeah, Monique.  Hi.  Hi.  We love Monique. 
[01:11:30]  We haven't heard from you in a while.  Yeah, busy working and going to school.  How many more days does Big Daddy have in the joint?  Well, Big Daddy's coming home for a week's furlough.  A furlough?  Yeah.  What the hell does that mean?  Because he's been behaving himself.  They let him out for a week?  Yeah.  And then he's got to go back?  Yeah.  And he's up on murder?  No, he ain't up on murder.  Just armed robbery.  Oh, God.  That's literally armed robbery.  Oh, my God.  That's a little something, you know.  That's just a little something. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, you know.  Ain't no day.  So he gets to come home for a week, you know,  and then he goes back a couple of weeks, months later,  he comes back for a weekend, you know,  until the bed is finished.  After that week, you're going to be stretched out like a pool on you.  Oh, my God.  Right?  I'm going to see if I can buy me a woman  just so I can take a nap every now and then, you know.  This guy's been in prison how long?  Oh, eight years.  Eight years.  He's coming home to you for a week.  Oh, this poor woman.  It's going to look like we're one of those daisy cutters hit in Afghanistan. 
[01:12:30]  Because I'm going to have to get that book.  He's an easy guy to ain't on my damn self.  Yeah, I guess so.  Well.  I hear he's got the bunker buster in his pants.  Oh, child.  I was telling him, you know, can't you get rid of that up there?  At least the man has a few options.  That's true.  That's true.  You know.  They're going to give a Pentagon briefing.  Here's the target right here.  Here's the junk.  And look at this impact area.  It's like Twin Towers all over again. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  I'm surprised I was watching that Michael Jackson show, man.  Why?  Because he looked...  The man's disgusting looking.  He looked like when E.T. was on the floor dying.  Yeah.  Remember that?  He turned all ashy.  Yeah.  You know.  He was like, if you take off his shirt, make me want to hurl, man.  E.T. got all ashy.  What about Whitney Houston?  Oh, man.  She looked like a hanger.  Bobby Brown did a good job of effing her up.  No.  Good job, Bobby.  No.  See, he wasn't working, so he ain't had no money for no stash. 
[01:13:30]  You know that's all, huh?  Yeah.  You know he's taking her cash and buying a crack at that.  Yeah.  You know, so you can't blame him.  You know.  I just picture a disheveled Whitney sitting on this couch with Bobby Brown arguing over  who got the last suck off the glass pipe, you know.  That's my hit, Mother, ever.  Shut up.  At least they can blame him.  You ain't had a goddamn record in years, you motherfucker.  Hey, shut up, bitch.  I'm going to smack your ass.  He liked that, though. 
[01:14:00]  You know, just back and forth.  Give me the pipe.  Give me the lighter with the four-foot flame.  With that blue flame.  Yeah, I heard Tiffany sell bombs in the basement anyway.  All right, yo.  So, well, y'all talk to y'all later.  Well, have fun with Big Daddy.  And, Opie, chill out, dude.  All right, dog.  Only three dollars.  It wasn't about the money.  I know, I know.  It was about the attitude.  I know.  Well, you know.  I, you know.  Just be easy.  Be easy.  We need the O&A, all right? 
[01:14:30]  All right.  All right.  Talk to y'all later.  It's all good, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, kid.  Baby.  All right.  Talk to y'all later.  Monique from Uptown.  Oh, man.  He flips her over.  He better put some Rolaids on the tip.  Because there's going to be some acid reflux.  I feel it.  That thing's going to back up right into her throat.  She's got a lot of...  Let's get some Tums.  Put it on the tip.  She's got a lot of cushion, though.  She'll be all right.  Oh, man.  Dude, eight years in the joint, this guy's been locked down. 
[01:15:00]  And we remember when his conjugal visit privileges were taken away.  That was years ago.  He's going to come home for a week?  How are they letting people out for a week?  What the hell is going on with our justice system?  That they're letting armed robbers, like, out for a vacation?  A prison vacation.  Prison vacation.  They just let him out for a week to roam around.  I don't know.  That don't seem right.  That doesn't seem right.  Let's go to Andrew.  Andrew? 
[01:15:30]  Hey, Opa.  I have a good idea.  Why don't you put a blood pressure monitor on during the show?  Yeah.  And another thing.  Going through Foundry Music is like doing a Rubik's Cube.  It's like the Rubik's Cube of the Internet, right?  Yeah.  You know, I live in Jersey.  I live like two towns over.  I think I got it.  I think I...  Oh, no.  There's some red and the green.  Two towns over from Whitney Houston.  I've heard a lot of stories about that.  Yeah.  In the middle of the night, you know, looking for munchies and stuff like that.  Yeah, we can't confirm anything.  We've all heard the story.  It's just the rumors.  It'll come out one day, I guess.  The real deal. 
[01:16:00]  Peace.  All right, Andrew.  Thank you.  All right.  Oh, man.  That's just going to be a mess.  Come here, baby.  Monique, you lay down, bitch.  I'm home, baby.  He's going to knock the door down with his junk.  Search warrant.  I think I got audio of Monique after the 20th time in a day.  Oh!  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:16:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Is there such a thing as too much sex, Anthony?  Uh, no.  I think Monique's going to answer that question for us.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  Ha, ha, ha.  Who knows, man?  Oh, my God.  You'd have to put a rain slicker over that.  God knows what's been going on.  Sean, what's going on? 
[01:17:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Uh, I want to be a Cherry Darts contestant.  You want to be a Cherry Darts contestant tomorrow?  Yep.  Cherry Darts for the Xbox going down tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show.  No doubt.  Uh, what's your pathetic story, sir?  Well, I'm just a poor college student.  Another poor college student.  Yeah.  Hey, where do you go?  I go to William Patterson University.  It's in Jersey.  Right?  Is that a community school?  No, it's no Staten Island community, but...  It's no Suffolk County community?  Yeah, that's it.  What's your major? 
[01:17:30]  Uh, communications.  Man.  I kind of like radio, too.  Everyone stop with the communications major.  Everyone wants to, uh, get into broadcasting.  Completely useless.  I went to Geneseo for communications, okay?  A lot of people ask our advice, Anthony, how to get into radio and stuff.  Oh, it's easy.  Here's one thing.  Don't take those stupid communication courses.  Did you have to show anything, uh, your first radio job?  Did you get your first radio job through your school?  No. 
[01:18:00]  All right, there you go.  And me, I'm not even going to talk about how I got here.  The advice I could...  Learn a trade.  The advice I could give to the youngsters?  Yeah.  Get on a radio station.  Screw the classroom work.  It's a bunch of crap.  Yeah.  You don't have to know all that gibberish about frequencies and whatnot.  No.  Find a college that'll put you on, you know, where you could go on the radio as a freshman.  There you go.  That's what you do.  Mm-hmm.  And then take, like, a business or something.  Something to fall back on.  I say you write song parodies and send them in to someone who's already in radio. 
[01:18:30]  Dude, I had a class at Geneseo.  Yeah.  Where we had to learn about sitcoms and we watched, uh, Fish.  Oh, you watched Fish.  Fish.  Remember Fish?  Yeah, yeah.  That little spin-off show?  Sure.  That's what we did in the classroom.  And you had to write something about Fish.  No, then we discussed sitcoms.  You just discussed it.  Oh, it was ridiculous.  All right, Sean.  All right.  Bye.  So good. 
[01:19:00]  You're not pathetic enough.  I'm pathetic.  I'm from Jersey.  I listen to you.  I like Jersey.  Jersey's cool.  Jersey's all right, man.  I did something for you guys one time.  What'd you do?  You remember a billboard incident?  Billboard incident.  Oh, yeah.  That was me.  Huh?  Remember the big wow on the, uh, billboard?  That was you?  Yep.  Come on down, my brother.  You're in.  All right.  Come on down.  I remember that.  That got us in a lot of trouble.  Another radio station had a billboard up, and, uh, boy, someone defaced it with a huge wow. 
[01:19:30]  A big wow.  They had to take it down.  Must have cost a bundle.  We encourage stuff like that.  So, Sean, come on down.  All right.  Come down.  We will reward you.  That's right.  You will be throwing cherry darts at this lovely lady from Privileged Gentleman's Club tomorrow.  For the Xbox.  Right.  Your courage as one of the ONA soldiers.  Very good.  Sean is our latest contestant for cherry darts.  And we do like Jersey.  And, uh, I just wanted to bring up the fact that, uh, Monique's, uh, parts, uh, they're 
[01:20:00]  probably going to look like Asbury Park once, uh, Big Daddy gets done with that.  Look at you being local for Jersey.  A little local.  There we go.  A little local angle.  How many, how many towns have we been local for today?  Oh, my God.  Or cities.  I can't even count.  Well, we were local for Wyandanche in Long Island.  Yeah.  We were local for, uh, New Jersey, Asbury Park.  Mm-hmm.  And we were local in Washington, D.C. talking about, uh, uh, Tyson, uh, the Tyson Mall.  Right.  Hey, turn that radio down.  Hey, Deke.  Hello, how are you doing, Dan? 
[01:20:30]  All right.  Say that.  See you.  What is he playing?  Deke.  He is a Deke.  Hello?  Hey, this is you.  Hello.  Hey, Deke.  How are you?  What were you playing in the background?  Uh, I had you on hold.  I'm in the office here, trying to get on this contest.  I heard a lady, though.  Yeah, there is a lady.  A big O&A fan.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you want to hear her laugh?  She say no.  She doesn't want to laugh.  I don't hear her laugh.  I listen to you every day.  Uh, and you want to be in on this contest tomorrow? 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, I don't even want the Xbox.  I just want to play.  I'll give the Xbox away to somebody else who wants it.  Oh, wow.  You said the wrong thing.  Oh, come on.  We take our prizes very seriously.  Listen, I'll auction.  Here's the deal.  I'll auction it off, all right?  And I'll give the money to charity.  September 11th fund, whatever you want.  I shouldn't have said that.  Yeah, Deke.  You're Deke.  That was bad.  You're blowing.  Oh, you're blowing.  Yeah, that's not good.  Uh, we could give you a bumper sticker or something.  Bumper sticker?  I got world stickers.  You got to see the world sticker. 
[01:21:30]  No, steak knives.  Steak knives.  Steak knives.  You'll get nothing unlike it.  Hey, can we play that?  The publisher's clearing house as we go to break.  I love that one.  Uh, Deke, you said the wrong thing.  All right.  I'm sorry about that.  Thank you, though.  I'm going to go to Mike real fast here.  Mike, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I'm just looking to be a contestant tomorrow.  You want to try to win the Xbox?  Yeah.  All right.  And what's up?  Well, I'm 23 and I'm still in junior college in Nassau.  And I don't have a car.  I take the bus to college.  You take the bus to college? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  You take the bus to a community college and you're 23?  Yeah.  And you still live with mommy and daddy, right?  Yeah.  Oh, and you're living at home.  Did they at least give you the basement so you kind of feel like you're on your own?  No, I still got the baby room from when I was 12.  Oh, you are pathetic.  What are you going to junior college for?  How about this one?  I'm going to be a policeman in the city.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Dude.  Dude, what are you doing, though?  What are you doing now? 
[01:22:30]  What happened?  How did your life get put on hold?  Well, I...  You know you got to move out of your parents' house.  Yeah, I know, guys.  Listen.  Do you smoke dope in the room you used to have your little baseball posters in?  Opie, you know me so well.  Who are you?  No, no.  I'm just saying that's exactly what I do.  I do.  Now, what happened that you didn't get yourself a vehicle?  Especially if you're living with your parents, you could save some money.  What?  I buy weed every day.  When did your parents realize that they were raising a son that wasn't going to be an astronaut 
[01:23:00]  and that was just going to be a slacker?  Was there something that happened where you just could tell in your mom's eyes that you  were just a huge disappointment in them?  Defining moment.  What was the defining moment where mom realized, oh, God.  I got it.  All right, boys.  When I moved out from Queens to here, I went to my first day in fourth grade and I went  into school and my mom didn't even sign me up.  What did they say to sign you up?  You forgot to sign me up.  All the other kids were signed up for school except for me. 
[01:23:30]  So you just showed up.  And I didn't even know my phone number because I was in fourth grade.  I had it written on my book.  How did you?  I pulled up and she had to sign me up the first day of school.  How did you get there?  Oh, I think I got dropped off, I believe.  So he wasn't even registered to go to school?  I wasn't even registered.  Did you get left back or anything?  Yeah, my senior year in high school.  Listen, now a lot of people know who I am.  You got left back in your senior year?  Yeah, it was in...  Because I never went to school all the time, you know? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, I did the same.  I didn't get left back.  I just stopped going.  Yeah, well, they didn't know from the class I failed in summer school, so I got left back.  What was the class you failed?  Economics.  Oh, I hated that crap.  And I passed every test.  I just went late and they took 15 points off.  If you had more than six absences and three lates were in absence.  You should have gotten yourself a trench coat.  I know, right?  All right, you're the next contestant for Cherry Dogs for the Xbox.  That's a sad sack story.  All right, boys.  Wow. 
[01:24:30]  Mom gave up on you in fourth grade.  Yeah, Mom gave up on me in fourth grade.  Mike, what about a girlfriend?  How's that situation going?  Oh, I'm a good-looking guy.  I just, you know, I'm a little shy.  Do you have one?  No, not right now.  And when you did have one, what was it like taking her back to your parents' house?  I used to go back to her house.  Yeah.  Oh, God, that is so sad.  All right.  Hold on, all right?  Dude, I went through a parking... 
[01:25:00]  Mike, get Mike's info.  He's coming down to try to win the Xbox tomorrow.  I went through a time in my life where I was seeing this girl, Lisa.  Her name was Lisa.  She lived out in Smithtown, out on Long Island.  And it was right at the time where General Motors, GMAC, took my car away.  Because for some reason, if you don't pay the payments on your car, they take the damn thing away.  I hate when that happens.  Yeah.  So I was hiding it for quite a while. 
[01:25:30]  I think I got away with it for about six months.  And then the repo guy finally found it in the train station in Greenlawn and took it away.  Took my car.  So now I had this girlfriend, Lisa.  And she lived in Smithtown.  I was in Huntington.  I would have to hop on the train and take the train to Smithtown and then walk from the train station to her house.  And she lived in a pretty ritzy neighborhood.  And we couldn't go anywhere.  Like, we couldn't go out anywhere.  So we'd sit at home. 
[01:26:00]  I'd sit at her house and watch TV.  Was that the one where the father basically told you to stop seeing her when she was in college?  Yeah, yeah.  The father, like, invited me in for a little speech and started yelling at me because he found out I had gone to Quinnipiac College, where she was going to school.  To visit her.  To bang her.  Senses.  Bang his daughter.  Right.  And he found that out.  And, oh, my God.  You weren't worthy enough for his daughter, right?  This guy, though, let me tell you something.  He introduced us. 
[01:26:30]  He used to go into the bar where my mother used to work.  And me and him would talk and stuff.  He was a funny guy kind of thing.  And he goes, my daughter's coming back from college and her boyfriend's such an a-hole and stuff.  Why don't you guys go out to one of the clubs tonight or something?  I'm like, yeah, sure.  So we go out.  We really hit it off.  We started going out.  And it just pissed him off to no end.  What do you think?  What do you think?  We're just going to go out to the show or something?  He said something weird to you, right?  Like, listen to me, my fine-feathered friend. 
[01:27:00]  That's right.  And I'm sitting there like, I don't have feathers.  It doesn't even make sense.  But at the time, you know, hindsight is such a great thing.  I think back.  And now, if anyone would have talked to me like that, you know, you think back and go, God, I wish.  You know, I wish I knew now and then, blah, blah, blah.  But I was sitting there just like, please don't throw away my up.  Oh, don't make it so I don't get laid by your daughter anymore. 
[01:27:30]  I better not say anything.  And I just sat there and took the abuse.  And if you ever go up there and bake my daughter out like a whore.  What?  He said all that to you.  Okay.  Okay.  I got a snow cone now?  A snow cone?  What's his daughter doing now?  I have no idea.  Last I heard, this had to be, he was this little, cue-balled head guy with a mustache. 
[01:28:00]  And last I knew, and this is going back years ago, she married a guy who looked just like her father.  And her father was a real domineering kind of guy over her.  Married a guy who looked just like him.  I'm like, hey.  All right.  Godspeed to you, Lisa.  Really fast, Paul the Pilot, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey.  I want to play cherry darts.  You're in.  All right.  Hey, Paul.  One of our regulars, Paul the Pilot, he does some sick crap with his plane.  Were you making a wow in the sky over Delaware? 
[01:28:30]  No.  Or Pennsylvania?  No.  Matter of fact, right, I'm stuck in traffic in Washington going around the loop.  Yeah.  I'm on my way home.  I just did an air show in front of 75,000 people at Stewart, Florida, and I had the wow  all over the airplane.  Oh, cool.  So I'm trying to spread it wherever I can.  All right.  Well, come on down tomorrow.  You'll be back, right?  Yep.  Hey, Paul, what kind of games are you going to play that are exciting for Xbox?  The guy flies these screaming aircraft.  You know, ooh, I found a real exciting game. 
[01:29:00]  Kind of takes the edge off the games.  Nothing better than throwing cherries at chicks.  Okay.  All right.  Fine.  You're in tomorrow, Paul.  Come on down.  Great.  All right.  I'll be there.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll catch up with you.  All right?  Okay.  Great.  All right.  Mike from the Bronx is saying my last story has earned me a spot to try for the Xbox.  Very good, Mike.  With that, we'll take a break.  Something from the O&A archives before we take a break.  So stay there for a few more minutes before you go local. 
[01:29:30]  Okay.  Hello?  Yes, I'm calling.  Is this ******?  Yes, it is.  What can we do for you today?  Yes, I just got a call.  Yes.  And he gave me my claim number.  Uh-huh.  Because I won a prize.  Yes, you did.  What claim number did you get?  654.  654.  3-2-1.  3-2-1.  6-J.  6-J?  Yes.  Ooh.  Pretty excited, are you?  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah?  You ever win anything before?  Never win anything.  Hold on, please.  Oh, okay.  Dude, tell her she won a European vacation.  Hello?  Hello?  That is coming up as a European vacation.  A European vacation?  Yeah.  He had told me something like $10,000.  I wish I were you, as a matter of fact, because it's a European vacation for your family plus $10,000 in spending money.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are you psyched? 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm, like, shaking.  This is, this is, oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Hold on.  We have our supervisor here.  Okay.  He's going to need, I guess, some information, maybe.  Hold on.  Hi, ma'am.  Yes?  Hi, this is John Huber, Bill's supervisor.  Can I have that number once again, please?  We've got to verify that you are, in fact, the winner.  Yes, it's 654-321-6J. 
[01:31:00]  6J?  Yes.  I thought you said A, John.  You thought she...  I thought it was an A.  Oh.  It's 6J?  It's 6J as in, uh, jump.  Oh.  We've got some good news and bad news.  You're still the winner.  Okay.  But, uh, your prize is a set of steak knives.  A set of steak knives?  Yes.  The European vacation for you and your family and the $10,000 spending money is for 6A.  Oh.  And you'll have to pay for the shipping on the, uh, steak knives.  Oh, all right.  And that's $19.95.  Okay.  Would you like to, uh... 
[01:31:30]  Uh, no, thank you.  Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.  That's fine.  Okay.  Well, thank you anyway.  Okay.  Oh, that was way too painful, man.  Oh, that poor girl.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One big door.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love that.  Boy, I haven't heard stained in a while. 
[01:32:00]  Oh.  Way to kill a band.  Yeah.  Thank you, radio.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  A little overkill.  Thank you.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey.  A lot of people call and they want in on the contest tomorrow, Anthony.  Cherry darts for the Xbox.  Oh, by the way, Mr. DVD's sitting outside.  He's going to come in in a few minutes.  Yeah.  Talk about DVDs and stuff.  I hear he's really cool, so we'll give him a shot. 
[01:32:30]  Erin, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  Good.  I was wondering how I can get to come up and play your contest.  Well, we need a few more ladies to throw the cherry darts tomorrow.  Yeah, that's what I kind of thought.  You're calling from Delaware?  Yeah.  Are you hot?  Sure.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hesitation.  Oh, no.  What's the main problem?  I don't...  What do you mean?  Well, there's a hesitation when we asked you if you were hot, so that means there's something 
[01:33:00]  wrong.  No, I don't think so.  What is it?  Bubble butt?  No.  Small boobs?  No.  Saggers?  No.  Bunt?  No.  No?  You got a bunt?  No?  No.  I wear glasses.  What's wrong with glasses?  I don't know.  All right.  Like, uh, what do you look like?  Um, I'm 5'6".  I have, like, brownish hair.  Uh-huh.  Um, I don't know.  Uh-oh.  I'm thin. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, wait, she said she was thin, though.  Okay.  Okay.  How much do you weigh?  Um, like 130.  Uh-oh.  Let me get my chart out.  Get your chart out.  But it's a much or two.  Well, what's the, uh...  That's the average, if you...  What's the bra size?  Um, 38C.  C?  All right.  That's normal there.  Nice.  Okay.  What's the chart say?  38 on a 5'6".  130?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  5'6", though.  No, that's about right.  Yeah, you're pushing.  You're on the upper part of the normal scale. 
[01:34:00]  Well, as soon as I get off the phone, I'm heading to the gym, so...  For 5'6", let me think.  Just upper part, Ant.  It's still...  Look, it's still in the normal range.  Oh, I see the chart there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's right in here.  Like, over here would be, you know...  Wow.  ...the chart, son.  You're okay.  It's not a crop duster.  What's that?  Nothing.  All right, Erin, we'll let you down tomorrow.  Oh, awesome.  All right, hold on the line.  Thanks.  There you go.  She's coming from Delaware.  Take care of her, Stinky.  Thank you.  Thank you, Stinky. 
[01:34:30]  You don't like that chick?  Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, uh, before I got married, my fiancée at the time promised me a PS2, and then we got married,  and then she said, well, let's wait a little bit.  We need to save money.  So then the Xbox was coming out.  So I said, I want an Xbox.  She goes, well, we really should think of the future.  So I'd love to win an Xbox, and the bonus is just throwing the cherries at the girls  while my wife listens.  Sounds like you're a pussy, though.  Yeah.  What happened, dude?  She controls your money?  Well, yeah.  What are you guys saving for? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, well, because we got to do save for the house, and then we got to save...  It's 300 bucks.  Excuse me?  What is it, 300-something bucks for the Xbox?  Pretty steep item, to tell you the truth.  She doesn't deem it necessary if it's not necessary.  Well, you know something?  It's necessary to your entertainment, my friend.  You got to show some balls and say, screw you, I'm getting this.  Well, I did that when I bought the computer.  Well, that's a necessary item, a computer these days.  It's like a telephone.  Yeah, but how did you explain that to her?  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  Well, I said that she could eventually use it for her schoolwork.  That's great.  That is the best move.  Well, you know, you could use this.  And, honey, we could do all our banking online.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Save money on the stamps.  No one out there does their banking online.  Oh, we do.  Everyone claims they do, but you're downloading porno, and you're playing your freaking computer  games, and she's never going to use it.  She's starting to.  I haven't clued her onto email or the internet, but she does her schoolwork on it.  Does she look up little recipes? 
[01:36:00]  No, not yet.  At least I do the cooking.  Dude, when I was married, I actually got away with maxing out a $4,000 credit card, buying  a Sea-Doo watercraft under the guise that it'll give us something to do.  I don't think she ever saw the back of that damn jet ski.  I was out on it all the time, solo.  I don't think she ever, ever wrote on this thing, and it was like, I had to sell it, too.  No, this will be great. 
[01:36:30]  It'll give us something to do.  All right.  Yeah.  Get stinky in here.  Let's vote on this guy.  Kind of a pussy, but he was able to sneak the computer by her.  Yeah, that's kind of good.  Although, a computer's easy.  Like I said, these days, you say, why?  No computer.  Ooh, why don't we just sell our phone?  Why don't you just get rid of the TV, and we'll listen to the radio?  Stink, did you hear this guy's story?  Yeah, his fiancée won't let her get an Xbox.  Yeah.  Wife?  Whatever.  Dude, is it fiancée or wife?  Very important. 
[01:37:00]  It's a wife now.  Oh.  How many pounds has she gained since she got married?  Well, she lost 14 to get into the dress.  Oh, that is the worst.  When did he do that?  Oh, my God.  That is the worst scenario right there when they lose the weight to get into the dress.  You are screwed as a man when that happens.  It's coming back.  It's coming back.  That's funny.  Bigger and better than before.  She lost it to get into the dress.  Oh, no.  Okay, so she lost 14.  All right, hold on.  Hold on to something.  All right, so she lost the 14 pounds to get in the dress. 
[01:37:30]  How much has she gained since the wedding?  If I say 14, I'm a dead man.  It's 28.  How much was it, dude?  Honest.  You know what?  I think she snapped back.  I think she just got the 14 back.  Got the 14 back.  And how long have you been married?  Uh, let's see.  Since July.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, 
[01:38:00]  you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you 
[01:38:30]  Based on the 14 pounds, she lost weight to get into the dress.  Yep.  Oh, that is the worst.  Yeah, well, I'm going to need a place to stay after today.  Even more reason that you deserve to be in the contest tomorrow.  Maybe look at it this way.  Maybe she'll find out what you said and give her a little initiative.  Yeah, the initiative to totally boot my butt out of the apartment.  Ah, but you'll move into a new place maybe with an Xbox.  With an Xbox.  And cherished memories of cherries thrown at... 
[01:39:00]  Ah-hoo-ha!  Ah-hoo-ha!  We don't know where the bullseye is, my friend.  Because the lawyers are working on how they could screw us on this one, trust me.  So we won't announce where the bullseye is.  That's okay.  All right, Dennis, hold on a line.  You're our next contestant for cherry darts for the Xbox.  It's going down tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Anthony from West Orange just writes, July, holy ass, no doubt.  That saved him, man.  Let's go to Paul. 
[01:39:30]  Hey, Paul, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  Do you want to hear my pathetic story?  Yeah.  I'm extremely, extremely pee-whipped.  You're pee-whipped, okay.  And that's about it.  But I did help you guys start team week.  You've got to give us an example of pee-whipped.  Yeah.  All right.  If I mentioned this contest to her, and her eyes basically turned into two daggers and 
[01:40:00]  dug into my skull.  So why are you pee-whipped?  Well, because I was considering not doing it, and this is the only way I think I can break  away from being pee-whipped.  Now, you're a pussy.  You're not selling me.  All right.  Well, I also helped you start team week.  All right.  I brought you your first nude teen.  We're in the 19-year-old.  He's playing with our heartstrings now.  Stinky, thumbs down, Rick. 
[01:40:30]  I'm down.  Yeah.  It's, you know, you're a nice enough guy, but it doesn't fit the M.O. of what we need  here.  That's cool anyway.  Thanks anyway, guys.  All right, man.  Hey, Phil.  What's up?  Hello.  What's up, Phil?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  All right.  I got my member stuck in a car door.  What?  Shut on a car door, actually, not stuck.  When did that happen?  It happened about a year ago.  I was in a park kind of by my house, and I was having sex with my girlfriend, and I was 
[01:41:00]  up on the front part of the car, like the front door, driver's side door.  Say that?  No.  I can't say that?  No.  All right.  How do you say that?  You don't say that.  Oh.  Help me out here.  I don't know what to say.  What?  Let's, uh...  Hmm.  All right.  Whatever.  So what happened?  Okay.  So the car window is down.  I'm leaning in the back seat to get a tissue, and she's like, are you all right?  Can you get on my gear?  Hold on one second.  She opens the car door. 
[01:41:30]  Something goes in between the crack.  I go, don't open the door.  She closes the door, and my guy was in between the door and the frame of the door.  It didn't close, but it just bounced off, and it was a excruciating pain for about five  minutes.  I went to my knees.  I bled a little.  It wasn't good.  You get nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Is that good enough or no?  You are one pathetic loser. 
[01:42:00]  No.  No, sir.  That happened last year.  You're over it.  Hey, I got a...  You'll get nothing.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I have the original hard luck story.  All right.  I've been married 23 years.  Absolutely faithful.  I've been dating her and doing it for 25 years.  And I am so pathetic.  It's so pathetic. 
[01:42:30]  It's just so frustrating.  Cutting our losses there.  Very good, Opie.  Very good.  Quick on the button.  Pete, what's going on?  He had nothing.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey, how are you, bro?  All right.  I got a pathetic story for you guys.  All right.  All right.  Well, because it's September 11th, I worked at a restaurant, and my restaurant had a cutback,  so I lost a job that paid me $13 an hour.  Now, three days later, my girlfriend, I go over to the house, you know, just chill out. 
[01:43:00]  What is she doing?  She's railing one of my friends who works for the fire department in her living room.  As I'm walking in, she's screaming, oh, F me, F me, F me.  Like, you've got to be absolutely kidding me.  Well, it's a firefighter, so she's doing a service.  Firefighters need some comforting.  Jesus.  Well, after 9-11.  Jesus, man.  Like, I just lost my job.  He was putting out the fire.  Yeah, he was putting out a fire right on her back.  Oh, on her back. 
[01:43:30]  It was really bad.  And on top of that, I had money.  I figured I'd have money saved up.  Now, I'm living off my parents.  I have $100 to my name, and I was thinking of putting that Porsche in Xbox, and they just  told me the other day, sorry, we can't afford that.  We can't spot you to $200.  So, I'm screwed.  Towards an Xbox.  You have $100 towards your name.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Oh, no.  You didn't make the cut.  No. 
[01:44:00]  Sorry.  Okay.  That's just, yeah, I wouldn't even think that's a real story.  All right, one more.  Sean, what's up?  What's happening?  I really got the story.  Are you black?  Mixed.  White and black.  All right, come on down.  Is that...  Oh, no.  Dude.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You still there, Sean?  Yes, I am.  That's awful. 
[01:44:30]  You are awful.  I know the struggle, my brother.  Come on down and enjoy Cherry Darts tomorrow for the Xbox.  All right.  Hold on.  I know the struggle.  Sean's in.  I wanted to hear his sob story a little.  Did he?  That was good enough, I guess.  Do you want to hear his sob story?  See if he's got one.  All right.  Stinky, see if he has a real sob story.  He's coming down anyway, though.  What a racist jerk.  Oh, yeah.  That's me. 
[01:45:00]  Look who's talking.  What?  What a racist.  Gah, gah, gah.  Ann, what's up?  Hello.  How are you?  Doing good tonight.  Good.  Hi.  I just wanted to call.  I had to find out.  Did you guys happen to watch Weakest Link on Monday?  With the wrestlers?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Some of the best comedy in years.  Oh, my gosh.  Me and my girlfriend were laying in bed laughing.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Slow down. 
[01:45:30]  Uh-oh.  Me and my girlfriend or my girlfriend?  Girlfriend.  While the husband was at work, she came over, and I had taped it from earlier.  So we were...  Wait, husband's at work, girlfriend comes over, and you hop in bed with her to watch The Weakest Link.  Well, we were...  She was up there for a while.  My husband wasn't coming home until 1230, and she was the surprise for the night.  So you do things with each other? 
[01:46:00]  Of course.  You have some fun with each other?  Of course.  There you go.  You've got to have half the fun.  But we died laughing over...  Were you naked when you were laughing?  Of course.  You've got to be naked in bed with an old girl.  Now, who's hotter, you or your girlfriend?  My girlfriend.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Uh, she's got the bigger chest.  How big?  She's got the chest like Stephanie McMahon.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  That's what we were just laughing about. 
[01:46:30]  Now, does your husband know about this girl?  Oh, yes.  And, uh, I guess he gets involved, too?  Once in a while, yes.  Once in a while, we like planning our little surprises for him.  Nice.  Just to make sure.  He's, uh...  Well, he doesn't get home until 1 o'clock in the morning, so we always like to have that  little adventure for him once in a while.  Nice.  Oh, there you go.  All right, so you're watching...  I've had a hard day work, dammit.  It's late.  What are you doing bringing over a lesbian?  Never. 
[01:47:00]  If he ever said that, I worry, because it's not my husband.  All right, so, uh, you...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You were watching The Weakest Link?  Oh, my...  We were just dying left.  Um, because one of our friends just got, um, her boobs done.  Oh.  And she works out with...  Thank you.  Even that hot story, I didn't even want to delve into it with that voice.  And I don't know what happened.  Call back.  Um, Anthony.  I watched that one, The Weakest Link with the wrestlers. 
[01:47:30]  That Booker T.  I don't want to lose any listeners.  I don't want her to think it was on purpose.  That Booker T guy?  I don't know.  Something wrong with your phone.  Try calling us back.  Uh, yes, Anthony.  He, perhaps the most ignorant guy I've ever seen on television.  Like a stone.  They asked him, um...  What was the holiday question?  Do you have that one?  Well...  Do you have any sound clips of that?  Yeah.  Well, why don't we start, um, uh, with The Big Show? 
[01:48:00]  Uh, The Big Slow.  The Big Slow, uh, was asked this on The Weakest Link.  Big Show.  The theme song of what TV show included the line,  A horse is a horse, of course, of course.  Captain Kangaroo.  Mr. Ed?  Captain Kangaroo.  Captain Kangaroo.  Captain Kangaroo.  Oh, no, no, no, Captain Kangaroo.  Captain Kangaroo.  You big, stupid man.  Mr. Ed, come on. 
[01:48:30]  Captain Kangaroo.  You know what I just realized?  A lot of those guys listen to this show.  I know.  Now, they're just going to beat us off.  They always do, though, man.  Captain Kangaroo.  Captain Kangaroo.  Captain Kangaroo.  Whoa.  Who was the skipper of the PT-109?  Captain Kangaroo.  Captain.  You're going to hear that again.  Who was flying the space shuttle Challenger?  Captain Kangaroo. 
[01:49:00]  Captain Kangaroo.  Big Show.  The theme song of what TV show included the line,  A horse is a horse, of course, of course.  Captain Kangaroo.  Mr. Ed?  Sorry.  Sorry.  Oh, my God.  What an ass.  Captain Kangaroo.  Hold on a second.  Mark, you're next to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, me?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  You guys got to let me play.  Why? 
[01:49:30]  You heard that story before about the guy that said he was pee-whipped?  Man, that ain't nothing.  He has nothing.  Yeah, no, that's why I hung up on him.  What's wrong with you?  Well, see, I've been married for five years,  and for five years my wife hasn't washed a dish in the sink  that I know of.  I cook every meal because I can and she can't.  See, I have a job that I just lost because of a lot of, you know,  because of financial reasons.  I got fired, and now I'm driving to camp.  Anthony, so Booker T was on The Weakest Link. 
[01:50:00]  Call back.  We don't know what happened.  There's something wrong with the phones today after I smashed them yesterday.  They're still tweaking them.  Loose connections still.  So please call back with your pathetic story.  Thank you.  Booker T, Anthony, on The Weakest Link.  Who was the man in command of the SS bounty?  That's the kind of rule.  Here's Booker T.  Booker T.  Booker T.  What French word meaning again is often shouted at the end of a concert? 
[01:50:30]  Oui, oui.  Encore.  Oui, oui.  Oui, oui.  Encore.  Encore.  Oui, oui.  Oui, oui, mother effer.  Oui, oui.  I'm Booker T.  Oui, oui.  Oui, oui.  Say, brother.  Booker T like a stump, like a tree stump.  You could have...  Tree stump.  We have more Booker T.  Listen to this one.  Please, tree stump. 
[01:51:00]  Booker T.  On the TV show Alice, Flo was known for saying,  kiss my what?  Butt.  Grits.  He got that one?  No, he said butt.  Kiss my butt.  He said butt?  Oh, it sounded like grit.  Brick wall.  In the 70s.  Sack of concrete.  Booker T.  Thanks.  What October federal holiday celebrates the discovery of America? 
[01:51:30]  Um...  Can we repeat that?  What October federal holiday...  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving.  No, Columbus Day.  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving in October.  Thanksgiving.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That is hysterical.  That is hysterical.  Lawn furniture.  What October holiday? 
[01:52:00]  Cinderblock.  Questions to you, Mr. Cinderblock.  Baa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Booker T.  Man.  Uh, Jesus.  Yeah.  And the T is for brains.  What's up, bro?  Listen, I got the worst story, man.  Listen.  Yeah.  I got a high school scholarship to go play football in college, right?  What college?  Uh, Hofstra.  All right.  Hofstra has a...  No, it isn't, you know, it isn't all that, but it's all right, you know, coming from where  I'm coming from, right? 
[01:52:30]  Hold on.  I'm going to help you out.  Hofstra has a pretty good football program, sure.  They do.  They do.  And where are you from?  I'm from the Bronx.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  All right.  Now, listen.  This was your chance to get out of the ghetto.  My chance to get out?  Oh, just like in all those movies we saw, there's always the one guy with a big chance  to get out.  Yeah, except that there's a little kink in the whole thing.  See, my first practice scrimmage at school, I blew out my knee.  So, there goes everything.  Now, I got to go through rehab, maybe surgery, and I'm stuck without a job, back living with 
[01:53:00]  my parents.  Were you able to finish your schooling?  No, it was at the beginning of everything.  As a representative of the white man, I'm giving you permission to sell drugs.  Okay?  Because that's a horrible story.  I'm stuck, man.  I need to get a chance to play for the text box.  It'll make me happy.  Dale from Jersey wants to know if this is a bookman from good times.  Didn't he have a similar sob story?  But didn't they give you the scholarship already? 
[01:53:30]  No, because if you can't see, if you can't play, and you can't produce for them, you get  nothing.  Yeah.  How do you spell nothing?  N-U-F-F-I-N.  There you go.  That's exactly how it is.  Nothing.  What do you guys think of Jesus?  Or is it Jesus?  Either way.  That's fine.  Jesus.  I like Jesus myself.  You like Jesus?  Jesus it is.  Okay.  What do you guys think?  Thumbs up.  Thumb up from Ben.  Come on.  Psycho Mark, thumbs up.  That's sort of a physical thing. 
[01:54:00]  I'm looking for more of a loser.  Mary, thumbs down.  I'm stuck.  I may have...  Hold on.  It's two...  All right.  Let's count.  Everyone.  Thumbs up.  One, two, three.  I'm probably never going to be able to play anyway.  I'm stuck now.  One, two.  I will...  Give the brother a chance.  Look who's talking.  Now, I got a crucial question before I vote.  Okay.  If you win the Xbox tomorrow, will you keep it for yourself or will you sell it on the street?  I'm going to keep it for myself.  All right.  Thumbs up. 
[01:54:30]  Come on.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Hank goes down.  Three up.  Two down.  You're in, Hazard.  All right.  Actually, Jesus.  Hold on.  You're in tomorrow for the Cherry Dark game, okay?  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Take care of Jesus there.  Anthony, as we move on with The Weakest Link.  The Weakest Link?  Lita.  Lita.  Lita.  Another brain surgeon.  And she looks better in the ring from that long shot. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Far away.  Yeah.  Well, no.  She's a butter face.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's listen to a little bit of Lita.  She's hot butter.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here's Lita from the WWE.  We'll be up on The Weakest Link.  Lita.  Yes.  If I mention the name George Bush to you, would it ring a bell?  Yeah.  Yeah.  On the $1 bill, maybe?  Which one should do?  Oh.  George Washington, I mean.  And Bush.  Yeah. 
[01:55:30]  I'm going to go.  Can I change my answer to The Weakest Link?  Can I?  There she is.  Lita saying she knows George Bush.  Got a little smug about it.  Yeah, I know.  He's on the $1 bill.  George Bush on the $1 bill.  This is some great stuff.  What an idiot.  Another clip from Lita.  Lita.  What first name is shared by the 41st and 43rd U.S. presidents?  Oh. 
[01:56:00]  James.  George.  Cut.  James.  George.  George.  James.  James.  All right.  We got no more Booker T, huh?  No, unfortunately not.  They booted him off right after.  Yeah, they booted him off.  He didn't last very long.  Yeah, he only had three.  The Big Show got booted first, which was weird.  I thought Booker T was going first.  But I guess, uh, Captain Kangaroo. 
[01:56:30]  Wasn't good enough.  Captain Kangaroo.  When he stood next to her, though, when she was booting him off, the size difference between  that little English twat, and, uh, the Big Show was just amazing.  He's giant.  She's like a little worm.  Here's our fave, uh, Stephanie.  Stephanie McMahon on the Weakest Link with her big, huge canes.  Why haven't you got big muscles?  Big muscles.  I got two big ones right here. 
[01:57:00]  She grabbed them and goes, I got two big ones right here.  All right, that's all we got from her.  Two big muscles.  And, finally, the last clip from the Weakest Link.  Who's your daddy?  Oh, that's all that is?  That was just thinking.  Oh.  Thanks, Nick.  Just saying.  That's kind of funny, though.  Who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  All right.  Yeah, it was, uh, just a mental smorgasbord.  All right, time to confuse everybody listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Again?  Uh, how many can we give away? 
[01:57:30]  A lot?  Three.  We got three pairs of tickets to 92.3 Extreme Radios, A Not-So-Silent Night.  Mm-hmm.  It's the Cleveland thing happening, Andrews.  Ah, Cleveland.  Featuring Blink-182, 311, Edema, Sum-41, and Pressure-45.  Uh, it's happening Friday, December 14th at the Cleveland State University Convention Center.  Convocation Center?  Convocation Center?  Cleveland Steamer Convention Center?  Whatever.  All right, to win the tickets, a number we've never given out before on our show.  All right.  We're going to mess everybody up. 
[01:58:00]  2-1-6-5-7-8-0-0-9-2.  Okay?  Why don't you give that out one more time?  2-1-6-5-7-8-0-0-9-2.  All right.  Let them hang.  Let them hang like the animals they are.  Anthony, Sam Adams.  Yes.

[01:59:30]  We gotta get Mr. D.B.D. in here, Anthony. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  And our buddy Titus is on the phone.  Look at that.  I forgot Titus was calling today.  Yo, Titus.  Where is he?  There he is.  Titus!  Wow, that last little song, I am actually gonna go worship the Dark Lord now.  That was nice.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  Let the bodies hit the floor.  That's what the kids are listening to.  That's good.  I can just hear the polyps growing on that guy's vocal cords.  Good job.  Titus, where have you been, man?  Oh, busting my ass.  We're 10 episodes in already this year for what we're producing. 
[02:00:30]  I'm actually, I'm just taking a break right now.  We're about to go film the black and white stuff.  Ah.  Busting my ass.  Had a baby.  Moved into a new house.  You know.  All that stuff.  Yeah.  It's going well.  The baby's been on TV like three times already.  So we just got her out of rehab.  What?  Hollywood's a bitch, man.  Show business doesn't play.  You got the baby now, huh?  Yeah.  It's weird.  My wife has a breast pump the size of two car batteries.  It's pretty frightening.  Actually, dims a light in the house.  How the hell did you talk a woman into having a kid with you, knowing your family history? 
[02:01:00]  And you know, mental illness skips a generation.  I said to my wife, I go, you know, honey, I'm worried because mental illness skips a generation.  Because my mom was insane.  And she goes, good.  And I didn't quite get the joke until like two days later.  She was talking about me.  My wife's such a, she's a hard ass.  Oh, there you go.  You're crazy.  No, I had to hear a joke, man.  I'm guessing my wife's joke.  Right.  So what's going on, guys?  We have the premiere.  We're going up against, what time?  Do you guys even know when we're on?  I haven't even known.  Yeah, when the hell is it on?  Wait a minute.  I'm going to guess 9.30 on Fox.  Okay.  Because Fox, you know, it's only like 2 o'clock. 
[02:01:30]  They might have changed this again.  Tell me I'm right.  I think it's 9.30 tonight.  Is it?  We're having a party, but knowing Fox, we'll have everybody at the house.  So the cast and crew will be at the party at my house watching the premiere, and they  will have moved us.  And now, another 15 episodes of Malcolm at the Bed-Hall.  Hey, that's a funny show.  I'm bitter.  I would be flattered if Titus was able to hear our commercial for his fine show, Anthony.  Oh, we got, yeah, we did do a spot for your show.  You're kidding me.  Would you like to hear it?  I would love to hear it. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Tonight on Fox at 9.30, it's Titus.  If you haven't seen the show, give it a chance.  Christopher Titus, he's a friend of the show.  More importantly, the show is goddamn funny.  Not your average sitcom, no.  More like a journey into Titus' own dysfunctional family.  Stacey Keach plays Titus' father.  He's a complete prick, this guy.  He's a sadistic, crude, abusive drunk who's constantly f***ing up Titus' life.  Oh, can you say f*** on a Fox spot?  They show lots of flashbacks to Titus' childhood where his dad just beats the living f*** 
[02:02:30]  f*** out of him.  Can you say f*** on a Fox spot?  Parental abuse, always funny.  And it says in parentheses.  Titus' brother David, a total stoner.  Yeah!  Which is nice to see on network television.  It's about time the pot smokers get a few characters on TV.  Titus' girlfriend's hot, too.  But not in the slutty way, no.  She's a piece of ass.  But not in the slutty way, like in a librarian way.  What the F does that mean?  Who f***ing wrote that?  Fox would like us to call this a wacky, light-hearted comedy.  But the truth is, it's a twisted little show.  If you like our show, you'll probably like Titus. 
[02:03:00]  So give it a shot.  Titus on Fox tonight at 9.30.  Wow!  There you go.  Who's writing your copy?  Gandhi?  That was great!  That was beautiful!  You know, it's funny, because Fox did try to change us up this year.  Like, we want to make it a romantic comedy.  We'd like Aaron to actually get a love triangle with Titus and her new boss.  And I was like, man, do you watch the show?  What the hell do you work for?  Oh, my God.  We didn't do it.  We didn't do it.  You know, here's our Christmas episode.  Our Christmas episode, basically, we isolate Dad on a houseboat so Aaron can shove Christmas 
[02:03:30]  down his throat, as most people should learn Christmas.  We get there.  David Carradine's playing his drunk buddy.  They're passed out on the houseboat.  Dad gets up, pukes in her ornaments.  And basically, we put David Carradine on the boat, send him away,  and then make Dad think he killed his best friend, so he gets the spirit of Christmas.  Very good.  David Carradine, huh?  Yeah, David Carradine, man.  That dude sniffed some paint, man, I'm telling you.  He's a funny guy, but my God.  Did they talk about the old days?  They did that movie, The Long Riders, together?  Oh, yeah.  Did you ever see that movie? 
[02:04:00]  They actually thought they were still in that movie.  Did they?  Riding horses and shooting people.  And then we've got the molestation episode where Amy, we find Amy who's moved in with  Titus, and Aaron comes out that she was molested, so Titus goes down to her school with a bat  to deal with the guy, as most good fathers would.  Right.  So we kept the edge, and tonight's racing in the streets.  Titus gets to rehab.  I guarantee you will laugh out loud at tonight's show.  Hey, I've got to ask you something.  What?  How pissed are you at Bernie Mac?  You know what? 
[02:04:30]  As I was told by the people in Network Power, it's an homage.  Bernie Mac bumped you, bro.  Well, you know, Bernie's a funny guy.  Here's the thing.  Bernie's a really funny comic and a real funny cat.  Yeah.  And, you know, what am I going to say?  Like I said, all I can do, I can't decide where the river goes.  I can only build a bat.  That's fine.  Yeah, bleep that.  Yeah, we bleeped that.  There you go.  Nice job.  They got your billboards up all over there.  No, it's a little crazy, actually.  It's in my head.  Actually, my head is actual size on that billboard. 
[02:05:00]  Is that your big head?  Yeah, it's actually that big.  That's got to be something, though.  You're driving along and, oh, my God, that's a big billboard in my face right there.  Yeah, I like that they're really edgy, too, aren't they?  Hey, behind every good man is when we're kicking his butt.  I know.  They push the envelope.  And that's what we're about at Fox.  We push the envelope, my friends.  We don't stop.  We don't shy away from the hard comedy.  Kicking his tushy.  No, I fought for butts.  See, it was tushy originally.  I don't mean to rip on them.  Fox, you know, they're trying to do family shows now. 
[02:05:30]  And it's just, you know, they shouldn't be making something what it's not.  And, you know, God bless them for even leaving us on the network.  Oh, God damn.  God bless them.  Yeah, you got to keep the edge on the show.  Oh, trust me, we didn't lose it.  We had, we actually have, we have an episode coming up that we filmed last week that there's a joke that we had to stop for three minutes while the audience finished laughing and owing.  So there's, I can't tell you the joke because it's 17-year-old Titus with his girlfriend. 
[02:06:00]  And it's just, it's pretty harsh.  We even made us cringe.  And yet the audience went nuts.  Good.  Good.  I guarantee every, every night you watch Titus, you will laugh out loud and you'll surprise yourself.  And if I don't, I will send you guys $1,000.  Wow, look at that.  That offer to everybody out there.  No, no, no, no, wait.  I work for Fox.  I can only afford you guys.  Did you see Michael Jackson last night, bro?  No, I didn't watch it.  I was out here working.  How was it?  That was right up your alley.  It was a freak show.  That was pretty sweet. 
[02:06:30]  There was some hilarious stuff going on on that show last night.  There's a guy whose father effed him up real good.  And his nose stayed on the whole time?  Barely.  What's left of it, yeah.  I think at some points he was holding his nose on while he was singing.  I keep looking at his nose and I just know that, you know, one of his foot is missing a baby toe.  That's what it looks like, a little toe.  It looks like a baby toe.  That's disgusting.  All right, Chris.  Well, you've got to get your ass in here soon, man.  Guys, I can't wait.  The next time I come out of New York, I'll definitely come down, man.  And thanks for having me on and helping us out.  I appreciate it.  Well, let me give you the big plug. 
[02:07:00]  Right after Bernie Mac, make sure you keep the TV on for Titus.  Fox.  That was nice, man.  That was the big plug?  930.  Play the commercial again.  Well, you know, a lot of people, you know, they watch the new show and then they forget that Titus is on next.  Yeah, well, you know, let's do a week.  It's Bernie Mac at 9 and Titus at 930 on Fox.  Is that better?  It's Malcolm at 8, Bernie at 830, Bernie at 9, Titus at 930.  Is Malcolm on again tonight?  Malcolm's on.  There's a new Malcolm on at 8, man. 
[02:07:30]  Dude, what is with Malcolm in the middle?  They put that show on every day on there.  I don't know, man.  You know, Titus, the Titus show is just Fox's bitch, man.  We are moved and messed with every day.  You know what, though?  Damn it.  We got the fans.  I was racing the NHRA this weekend, man, and people are crazy.  The effing Titus fans that just come up and they don't say anything.  Effing Titus, yeah!  Those guys.  So we got millions of those and maybe we can just take over Fox.  You know what you got to do?  Malcolm had the nude teens on this past weekend.  The new what?  Malcolm in the middle. 
[02:08:00]  Nude teen girls.  They did.  They, like, went on this camp, like a little vacation getaway, and there was a girls' camp  across the lake, and the boys were just trying to get over to the girls' camp, and there  was a scene of one of the teen girls in the lake, and she takes her bikini off, and her  teen boobs are bobbing just below the surface of the water.  I was fixed.  The commercial for that episode of Malcolm sold me.  I had to watch the episode.  Wow. 
[02:08:30]  Actually, it changes.  If we do a Stacey Keach doing that at a girls' camp, it just changes the entire show.  But then again, we're on a 9.30 show.  Nude teens, Titus.  Remember that.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Titus.  Talk to you.  Bye.  Thank you.  We like that guy.  Christopher Titus.  He busts his bullies, but he's a good guy.  Yeah, he was fun.  Last time he came in, we had a great time.  And the show is really good.  Yeah.  It's on tonight, 9.30 on Fox.  Okay?  God damn funny, as quoted by Opie.  Jen, what's up?  Hey, what's going on? 
[02:09:00]  You sound like a stoner.  Me?  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  All right.  How old are you?  Me?  Yeah.  I'm 19.  All right.  You're 19.  I'm 19.  What's your story?  Me?  Well, my boyfriend's a loser, and I think I deserve to throw cherries at a hot stripper  and try to win an Xbox.  You deserve to throw cherries?  Yeah, I deserve it.  You are definitely a pothead.  You have all the signs.  Yeah, and the lap.  You got the pothead lap.  He's got the pothead lap.  Do you want to win an Xbox? 
[02:09:30]  What?  When was the last time you got stoned?  Me?  I don't remember.  I want another one.  She would be perfect for the stoner spelling bee as well.  You know, I got a funny story about that, actually.  Yeah, go.  I was writing this memo up at work, right?  Yeah.  And I tried to spell et cetera, but I didn't spell it right.  Instead of et cetera, I wrote excreta. 
[02:10:00]  Excreta.  Because I came up on the spell check, because I spelled it E-E-C-T.  I don't remember how I spelled it right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.  You've got to watch that language of yours.  You're also a little potty mouth.  Sorry.  Potty.  But in the memo, right, it said, like, please bring your donations of food, and, like, you  know what excreta means, right?  No.  It means, like, feces, you know?  To excrete.  So, yeah, I almost lost my job on that one.  Oh.  And what is your job? 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, I'm a secretary.  Yeah, I'm a secretary.  So you type up memos all day long?  Yeah, yeah.  And your, what, your boyfriend's, what?  You're saying he's a loser?  Dude, he's 24, he lives at home.  He sleeps on a friggin' couch, dude.  On a couch.  At his house.  So what are you still doing with him?  Huh?  He gets the good pod, right?  Yeah, a little bit of that.  Yeah.  And, you know.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  He's got a big one. 
[02:11:00]  He's got a big mule?  Just say he's got a big mule.  So wait, he gets good pod and he has a big mule, but the rest of him is nothing special  and that's why you're with him?  Yeah, well, that, you know.  He's nice, you know.  Yeah.  Who cares he lives at home?  That's good.  You like the big mules, huh?  Yeah, yeah, you know.  All right.  When did you lose it?  When did I lose what?  Yeah, the virginity.  Um.  The young girl.  Uh, I don't know.  Maybe like 15.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, who's...  What is that?  Who's doing a bong hit in the background?  That was me drinking a McDonald's drink.  Oh, all right.  I wish I had some buds because that's what I'd be doing right now.  Good day.  Listen to you guys driving around smoking weed, you know?  What, um, what do you look like?  Me?  I'm 5'2 1⁄2".  Oh, I love it.  That is a funny...  I'm 5'2 1⁄2".  I'm 108 pounds.  Ten bucks you get her to say that again, Anthony.  What?  Nothing.  You don't even know.  What do you look like? 
[02:12:00]  I'm 5'2 1⁄2".  I'm 108 pounds.  I got, like, you know, decent-sized chest.  I mean, I'm not, like, no D-cup or nothing, but I'm a BC.  It's all about how, uh, it's all about the shape, really.  Yeah, no, no.  I got a really nice figure.  Yeah, okay.  And what kind of...  I don't got no big ghetto booty, you know what I mean?  But I got a nice ass.  Oh, really?  What kind of clothes do you like to wear?  What?  What kind of clothes do you like to wear?  Uh, tight clothes, like black pants, you know, tank tops.  Hey, what does your hair look like?  Me?  I got brown hair.  Oh, damn it. 
[02:12:30]  I stepped up.  You got a son of a bitch.  I mean, even if you guys don't want me to come up there  to, like, try to win the Xbox,  they'll come up there and hang out on a lesbian couch.  Oh, you're into that?  You're into the women?  Well, I never actually, like, had an experience like that,  but, you know.  Yeah.  Well, you never had an experience like that?  Yeah, like a woman-not-woman experience.  What's the closest you've ever gotten?  To a woman?  Yeah, yeah.  Not really. 
[02:13:00]  Like, my friends come on to me, but, like, my girlfriends,  but, I don't know.  What do they do?  I don't know.  Like, you know, they try to, like, touch me, you know,  kiss me, try to get me drunk, and, you know.  Hey, can we get you on the lesbian couch tomorrow  as a little, like, halftime show?  Halftime show?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I kind of want to try to win that Xbox, though.  No, you're in on that, trust me.  I am?  Yeah, you're too good.  Oh, that's so sweet.  Yeah.  Yo, can I bring some buds?  Double or nothing, Anthony.  What?  Okay.  What?  No, I didn't hear what, oh, oh, no, we got plenty of that. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, nice.  Are you going to bring anyone with you?  Um, I guess so.  You want me to bring my loser boyfriend?  Nah, don't bring the loser boyfriend.  No.  No, but you got to see him, dude.  Would you like to go into the stairwell?  The stairwell?  Yeah.  What's up with that?  Stinky stairwell.  I don't know about that.  It's famous.  It's where everyone goes to smoke pot around here.  Oh, cool.  I'll be there.  Yeah?  I'll be there.  No doubt.  Last shot in.  Come on.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:14:00]  Who did you lose it with when you were 15?  Oh, God, this friggin' loser.  Ah, another loser.  Very big one.  Have you only been with losers?  Uh, well, kinda.  Yeah?  Kinda.  I've been with some rich dudes, you know?  Yeah.  Couple losers.  You got your own place?  No, not yet.  Saving up money and living at home.  Actually, I was living down in South Carolina for a little while.  You are?  Yeah.  Where are you originally from?  Me?  I'm from Pearl River, New York.  Damn it!  I'm from New York. 
[02:14:30]  Money!  Come and get home tonight.  You're not getting late to you.  You are a pisser, man.  I'm a bitch.  That is so funny.  Double or nothing.  One more minute.  Huh?  Oh, I don't know.  I might want to just back out.  Double or nothing.  All right.  One more minute.  You have one minute, though.  You have one minute.  One minute for what?  No, then we're just talking amongst ourselves.  So, you like playing games?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Like, uh, you would enjoy the Xbox?  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah?  You have no idea.

[02:16:00]  I just lost 40 bucks.  It was seven seconds to go.  I know.  That was close.  I couldn't remember any of the questions.  All right.  Uh, Jen, you'll be down tomorrow to, uh, try to win the Xbox.  Yo, what time is that?  Well, hold on, and, uh, someone will talk to you.  All right.  Hook you up.  All right.  Thanks.  New friend of the show right there, Jen.  That is the funniest goddamn thing.  Me?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I was, I was losing it, too.  I knew time was running out. 
[02:16:30]  Damn it.  Matt.  Yeah.  What's up, bro?  What's up, guys?  Dude, we got this lady down here at MSG at the sticker stop.  Wait, wait.  Uh, hold on.  I didn't even know we were doing a sticker stop today.  Oh, yeah.  We're down here at the Ranger game right now.  Oh, all right.  In front of the garden, yeah?  Down here, she's got her top off, walking around to regular businessmen trying to get  to their trains, running up and grabbing their piece.  Why is she doing that?  I have no idea, man.  She's, she's offering BJs and, just, well, right now she's topless in a crowd of about 
[02:17:00]  200 people.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because they're probably dumped out.  She's topless in front of 200 people and she's offering Hummers?  Yes.  Yes.  Right now she's doing a split.  What's it?  She's insane.  You want to talk to her?  Yeah, definitely.  Hold on one second.  Opiate Anthony here on the phone.  There you go.  Oh, hello.  Hi.  There might be a girl, baby.  No cursing.  Hi.  Yeah, no cursing.  No cursing.  I can't hear. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, don't, don't say anything.  I just saw you on, I wrestled so many times and you guys didn't circle, then I saw you  on the show.  Hey, hey.  They stole my violin.  They stole my car.  Oh, my God.  What's your, what's your name?  Who, me?  What's your name?  I just saw me in England and guess what?  What's your name?  My name is Gloria.  What?

[02:18:30]  I mean, she looked like she was probably good looking like, like, maybe like 15, 20, 25 years ago.  How about a bonnet egg?  Get off my penis.  Get off my what?  Get off my junk, he said.  No way.  He yelled, he just yelled, get off my junk.  I think she accosted him.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  I'm getting a little more aggressive as the time goes on.  Oh, God, she's chasing me.  All right, Matt, we'll check in with you in a little while, but we got a topless chick  outside the garden as we get ready for the Ranger game tonight.

That was too good.  Me?  And then she wouldn't always do it.  The funniest part, she wouldn't always do it.  Right.  But then, like, you'd have to get her at a certain point.  You couldn't ask her.  I noticed you couldn't ask her rapid fire one after the other.  I would have to stop a little, then ask her a question to get the me.  Either that or if Opa's talking to her and you interjected, that threw her off. 
[02:19:30]  So she threw out the me.  That cost me $40.  I know.  Dude, I swear I thought I was done.  I'm just looking at the clock.  No, this is it.  I got seconds left.  All right.  Me?  Finally, Mr. DVD will be in next.  I hear he's very entertaining.  So, Wood checking in from Bayshore saying, is it me or is it easier to understand Ozzy  at the garden than this girl at the garden?

[02:22:00]  OB and Anthony.  WNEW.  All right, let's get Mr. DVD in here.  This is the OB and Anthony show.  Ted from Newark writes on the Instant Feedback.  Jen is like the guy in Memento.  She can't make new memories and forgets that she is engaged in a conversation with someone.  Yes.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  Me?  What?  Oh, my God.  Look at this dweeb that just walked into the studio. 
[02:22:30]  Me?  Me?  Me?  Wow, dude.  I know.  You're dweaving it up real good today, man.  It's a sweater vest.  You know, that really just says big old nerd.  But the thing is, when I watch movies, I'm getting paid for it.  And when you watch movies, you're sitting there, you know, going,  I wonder how Ariel and the crab are going to get out of this predicament.  Right.  It works out okay.  You know, I'm willing to look dorky if I can get away with that.  I have a lot of confidence in him now. 
[02:23:00]  I mean, what else is he going to do besides watch movies?  Oh, OB.  Oh, what?  That wasn't funny?  No, actually, it was.  Oh, okay.  Me?  Me?  Wasn't that chick funny?  Cal, we got to get the stinky cam back up and running,  because you got the cute little sweater on.  Cute little sweater.  It's like a sweater vest thing, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was very well dressed.  I see a lot of 50-year-old guys wearing these, you know?  And I figured I'd get a head start. 
[02:23:30]  Come on.  What am I going to show up in, you know?  That was well dressed.  Big silver DVD outfit?  No.  Why is everyone getting so uncomfortable here?  You know what doesn't help?  The visitor pass.  I know.  Anytime you have a name tag on.  Anytime.  I had to go through a security screening to get through here.  That's ridiculous now.  You know, it's like, what, are Al-Qaeda worried about boob jokes?  Is that the deal?  They've got to get up and destroy this station.  You know, I actually have on my computer one of the visitor tags with my name on it.  I actually had to go to the desk, because somebody that had seen me coming and going out of this building for three years, 
[02:24:00]  I didn't have an idea, though.  He saw me.  He thought maybe Osama bin Laden was dressing up as people that work here, maybe.  And once you get that building pass, though, there's a tricky thing that no home printer and some laminate can throw together in about three seconds.  That's the keys to the kingdom, pretty much, isn't it?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Mr. DVD, are you wearing slacks?  Are you a slack type of guy? 
[02:24:30]  Let me see.  They're trousers.  I'm not sure.  Trousers.  Those are, um, what are they?  Is that denim?  Black denim?  Sort of a cocky.  Sort of like a cotton deal.  Yeah.  Well, he's got the blue dress shirt on, the sweater vest, and trousers.  This isn't the fashion awards.  He's talking about DVDs.  Does the nose come with the glasses, or?  Oh, you are just awful.  That was a, that was a, I'm just going to say me from now on.  No, I wasn't talking about you.  That's awful.  I'm sorry, Mr. DVD.  I want to know about what he does.  He's, uh, like a DVD guy. 
[02:25:00]  I haven't heard of DVD guy.  I work for a company called Netflix.com that does online DVD rental.  I'm a film critic there, and a couple years ago.  Online DVD rental?  How does that work?  You order them online, we mail them right to your door for 20 bucks a month.  You can have free films, discs out.  But when you mail one back to us, we mail a new one to you, and there's no due dates,  no late fees, and we carry 10,000 titles.  What do you do if the guy just holds it and keeps it, and you start writing it back and  go, hey, no late fee, but, you know, come on, some, Rocco's going to come over there 
[02:25:30]  and break your legs.  Well, if you're watching a disc like Fight Club, which has four different commentary  tracks, you can watch that five times, get something new from it every time.  You want to hang on to that for a couple months.  As long as you're paying 20 bucks a month, and it's one of the movies you have out,  no problem.  Oh, so you put your credit card in online or something?  Absolutely.  All right, and then 20...  If your kids want to watch Mulan like eight billion times until you want to slaughter  him in their bed...  Right, right.  Hang on to it as one of your movies.  All right, I got you.  So 20, you're being charged $20 a month.  20 bucks a month. 
[02:26:00]  That means you're just to have the Fight Club for six months, whatever.  Yeah, that's late fees on one movie that I rent, 20 bucks, usually.  I cannot get back to Blockbuster to turn in my goddamn movies.  Every time it is 20 bucks, doesn't matter what I rent.  I hope we're not wasting our time with this little picker.  What?  Where did that come from?  I think that was Cartman.  That was Cartman.  I'm sorry, Mr. DVD.  So now you probably have watched...  So a couple years ago, I said to my boss, we're getting a lot of questions about DVD. 
[02:26:30]  He's looking at...  We could turn it into a column.  And she said, why don't we call it Ask Mr. DVD?  And I said...  Ask Mr. DVD.  And I said, that sounds better if I ask a big old film nerd, so let's go with that.  And tragically to this day, I've got like Mr. DVD on my business card.  People say, oh, is this your wife?  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listeners.  Now, what movie is that from? 
[02:27:00]  It sounds like Will Ferrell.  Oh, Mr. DVD.  Mr. DVD.  Mr. DVD.  That's a very, very...  One of the best comedies ever made, in my opinion.  And that would be...  Huh?  And that would be?  Trains, planes, and automobiles.  Or planes, trains, and automobiles.  Wait, planes, trains...  What did I say?  Trains, planes.  And it's planes, trains?  Planes, trains.  I thought it was trains, spotting planes, and automobiles.  I always thought it was trains, planes, and automobiles.  We should give them some movie clips.  Yeah?  Yeah, we'll test you out a little bit.  That was Steve Martin.  There we go.  That was Steve Martin. 
[02:27:30]  Okay.  Which one is this?  What movie is this from?  Stock that chink a day's pay for napping on the job.  Yes, sir.  He rode a blazing set.  There you go.  Yep.  Gonna star Richard Pryor.  Oh.  And they said, no, he's a big old drunk and doing too much of this.  Gotta hire Cleve and Little.  Cleve and Little.  And Richard Pryor just helped out with the writing.  And Cleve and Little, tragically dead.  Really?  Yeah.  What was it?  Yeah, when did he die?  About four or five years ago.  And it was some kind of pancreatic or liver cancer. 
[02:28:00]  Ah, it got so many of the Hollywood community, that pancreatic.  Well, Bill Hicks died that way in 1921.  Ah.  Yeah.  Bill Hicks went out that way.  Absolutely.  How about this one?  I got it from a negro.  Can I hear that again?  I got it from a negro.  Oh, Mr.  No, I'm out.  Same as this.  Ah.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Animal House.  Uh-oh.  Hey.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Mr. DVD. 
[02:28:30]  I'm being held in scorn and derision here.  Mr. DVD.  Oh, and now we're putting in something humiliating, McCartney.  You are one pathetic loser.  Oh.  Okay, I'll give you another hint.  What movie is that from?  is it the story of a guy who dropped by  just to talk a little bit  subjected to abuse but no one cares  because that's what the show is all about  is it from that movie  because I hear about playing theaters this fall  Michael Mann's directing it  Clooney's in it, everyone's going crazy 
[02:29:00]  well that movie plays every day  that movie plays every day  here at WNEW, doesn't it  that other movie, also this  there's a famous sound for that movie  listen to Mark  come on  you can't remember that?  give me the horn sound again  my number one  Caddy Shack  but this whole place sucks  that's right, it sucks 
[02:29:30]  remember that?  are you related to Tim Sabian?  no  our program director from Philly?  they dress a lot  that's all  are you in all week  Mr. DVD?  because we might run out of time with you  I'm staying in the New York area  for as long as you'd like to subject me to scorn  or we could talk about  some terrific films coming out soon  on DVD  see, I hope he's like that  ok, what's coming out  that's what I want to hear  let's try to get some DVD reviews here 
[02:30:00]  plenty of stuff coming out next week  this week is kind of doggy  you got  the big movie this week  would be America's Sweethearts  with Julie Roberts  there are some deleted scenes on it  and one only hope  and well they should be  a little more Christopher Walken  because  you need that  in your movie  oh wait, wait  now that was it  oh hey  Mr. DVD  now it's mine  are you  you doing impressions?  a little Walken  a little Walken  you gotta do some talking like Walken 
[02:30:30]  because he's crazy  very good  you know  all the kids love it  look at any other  you watch a lot of DVDs  do you do any other impressions  of some of the stars  you see in the DVDs?  you know  the thing is that  you know  when I write for work  I totally get my nerd on  you know  it's like  exactly  oh narrative  you know  cinematography  and then you know  you start talking like Sean Connery  and the whole thing  goes right to hell  so you know  it's just no good  it's a contradiction  can you do Sean Connery for us?  a little bit  certainly  I can do that for you  a single ping  that's right 
[02:31:00]  when Cortez reached a new world  he burned his ships  so his men would be properly motivated  that's more of a one ping  yeah  yeah  that's kind of a mini ping  ping pong  coming out next week  yeah  what next week?  hold on  hold on  can I back you up?  because I do have a serious question  for Mr. DVD  what's coming out next week?  well the Shrek DVD  that came out  and it's selling like gangbusters  2.5 million  and it has like two discs 
[02:31:30]  and stuff  and you know  anything special on there?  there's a couple things  on the second disc  there's a little musical note  over all the characters  in the lineup  are these campfire tales now?  should I be making some s'mores?  you highlight a musical note  and it brings up  a six minute long  musical montage  are you happy?  no  it's a hidden feature  a lot of making up stuff  wait what happens  because I was laughing too hard  at the crickets  no I'm serious  what is it? 
[02:32:00]  it's a musical note  what?  you know I gotta see both your hands  because they're gonna bring up  a farting noise  okay  there's a musical note  on the main menu  of a second disc  and you highlight  that musical note  with your remote  hit enter  and it was like  a six to eight minute long  musical sequence  Mark shut up  I'm answering a question  I was at  I know  yes I like  there's another wacky  it's sort of a  redo of a credit  it's a six to eight minute long  musical sequence  so that's on Shrek  lots of technical stuff 
[02:32:30]  commentary from filmmakers  you want to see the black Shrek?  where's Earl?  where's Earl?  I swear to God  this guy  the second Shrek came out  we were like  this guy's Shrek  while they get him  what's coming out next week?  two disc set  for Planet of the Apes  ah what'd you think of that?  the actual movie?  yeah  it bloated  there's two things  that are wrong with that movie  the one is that  Mark Wahlberg  is too passive an actor  to be pulling a plow  on a summer blockbuster  you look at  you look at the good 
[02:33:00]  Mark Wahlberg movies  like Boogie Nights  Rockstar  even the yards  he's a reactive actor  he's a guy who like  you know responds to stuff  instead of causing it  the other thing is that  the ape characters  are all better developed  than the human characters  and that's totally Tim Burton  because  Tim Burton's all about  oh god bless you  you plucky little outsider  we're gonna run for you  look at Shrek  there we go  doesn't he look like Shrek?  if he was green  he'd be Shrek  there we go  profile  give him the profile Earl  show him the doll  look  look at the doll we got 
[02:33:30]  we got the  isn't that funny  he's Shrek  splitting image right  you guys all know Earl  and work with Earl  and I'm a guest  so Earl could kill me  and put me in a dumpster  and nobody would know  he would never do that  I'm just gonna hold off  on that  he looks pretty mean  but like Mark Wahlberg  he's pretty passive  yeah  you can't pull the plow  in a summer blockbuster  what's your favorite DVD  Mr. DVD and why  there's a bunch of them  everything from a great 
[02:34:00]  two disc set of  Boogie Nights  to Traffic  even though there was  no extras on it  because it's a great movie  and I love that  restoration of  Lawrence of Arabia  they did  which is just  a great movie  and a great disc  and also  the Pixar films  Bugs Life  Toy Story  those are the best  possible DVD pictures  you're gonna see  because there's no film  involved  when they put them  on the disc  they just transfer them  digital to digital  no loss  no nothing  so yeah  they're just 
[02:34:30]  glowing luminous pictures  so yeah  I thought I told you  to shut up  and that's okay too  why are you turning red  Mr. DVD  because you know  we're showing some love here  I hear you  I hear you  you know  it's like  it's all  it's all friendly joshing  joshing  yes  joshing  or just joshing  don't worry about it  you will not get  any fart noise  also out on disc  next week  next week  The Grinch  ah yes  you like The Grinch 
[02:35:00]  the Christmas  you don't like The Grinch  I kind of like The Grinch  the only reason  for Ron Howard  to remake  the original  animated The Grinch  is because  that one  wasn't making him  millions of dollars  it's like  okay  I'm going to go out  cut a big fat check  for myself  stupid voice  and just pretty much  remake a movie  that doesn't need  to be remade  also out next week  the DVD  of Apocalypse Now  redo  ah that I want to say  that's something  we all got to say  more footage  53 extra minutes 
[02:35:30]  53 extra minutes  and how long  originally was that  oh well over  you know  close to three  so the thing's gigantic  you know  bring a lunch  stay for the day  but that's what  we're seeing  you know  we haven't asked  them about  the Godfather DVDs  that came out  have you seen those yet  no  what kind of extras  I hear the extras  are unbelievable  you get a full disc  of extras  and a lot of that  stuff has been around  for years  on the Laserdisc box  and what have you  but you see things  like Martin Sheen  trying out for  Michael Corleone  ah  Bobby De Niro  trying out for  Sonny Corleone 
[02:36:00]  even when they  made Jimmy Conn  try out for  Michael  the studio  Paramount  Jimmy Conn  Jimmy Conn  you call him  Jimmy Conn  in the business  he's close to him  Jimmy Conn  not at all  you ever meet  the Jimmy Conn  no  I would  you know  I would have to  dive in  because it's just  so good  yeah  I hear those  DVDs are  unbelievable  though  yeah  the commentary  tracks  because Coppola  owns his own  DVD pressing facility  so he makes  his own discs  and his own wine  and his own  spaghetti sauce  but the commentary  on Godfather 3 
[02:36:30]  actually makes it  worth watching  wish somebody  put this retard  out of his misery  well let's go  to the phones  the phones are lit  here  let's start with  Doug  Doug from  Springfield  what's up  how you doing  I tell you  this is a gentleman  if you ever  saw the DVD  don't let the  door hit your  ass on the way  out  stop it  is that a  western  is that  weird  I've never  heard of that  movie  what genre  would that  be there  Doug  genre  a guy  not making  any sense  on the radio  he's making  perfect sense  that's a double  feature with 
[02:37:00]  the guy  who for short  attention span  calling in  to complain  about stuff  there you go  Mr. DVD's  got some chops  to him  Bill what's up  hey what's  going on  O&A  yo what's  going on  with Rudolph  Giuliani  doing the  DVDs man  Rudolph  Giuliani  are you  implying he  sounds like  Rudy  Rudy  with the  list  what are  you talking  about  come on  man  what 
[02:37:30]  with the  list  I'm  Rudolph  Giuliani  I know  about  DVD  turn your  radio down  when you  call  very  distracting  when they  have the  radio on  Mr.  DVD  it's also  very distracting  when they  talk crazy  too have you  noticed that  yeah  we put up  with these  callers  every day  they're a  collection  of very  close  retarded  children  that we  have  that's how  we feel  about them  we want  to just  enter them  into  special  Olympics  every year  wow look  at all  the  normal  radio  stations  you've  been on  before  yeah  exactly  you know  it's a whole 
[02:38:00]  list of them  Anthony  comes highly  recommended here  all right  what else  can we look  for now  a lot  of stuff  the  godfather  discs  of course  citizen  kane  is very  good  but there's  a lot  of other  you know  more slam  bang  stuff  I like  stuff  with a lot  of extras  I like  the extras  on  but good  extras  coming soon  is a free  disc set  of almost  famous  with the  director's  cut  and 12  tracks of  music by  the fictional  band  in the 
[02:38:30]  movie  uh oh  that's  gotta be  god awful  well you know  it's sort of  like  warmed up  over rock  it'll be  interesting to  see the  actual  director's  cut  right  of almost  famous  so that's  coming soon  with lots  of extras  I hate seeing  the deleted  scenes on  these dvds  because most  of them  suck  that's why  they're deleted  yeah and there's a reason  why they were deleted  that's pretty much  why they were deleted  is there any dvds  out there where the  deleted scenes are  actually really good  and there was a  reason they cut them  there's a couple  ones uh the film  go  uh you remember  jay moore 
[02:39:00]  jay moore  sarah paulie  you know  our pal jay  jay he's that gay  actor jay moore  yeah i heard that  on this station  and uh but uh  oh you listen to us  yeah you know  when you watch  the uh  he's pretty smart  i know  this cat  uh on go  you can watch  the deleted  scenes and see  how they  shut up demi  i didn't touch  anything mr dvd  and see how they  completely changed  shut up demi  shut up demi 
[02:39:30]  i look  look my hands  are in the air  mr dvd  there we go  can i call you d  for short  no it's okay  that's sure  that's terrific  all right go ahead  no  my hands  my hands are in  the air though  i'm gonna check  my briefcase  for peanut butter  and jelly  because it's  grade four  all over again  can we call  my mom tonight  it's those cool  kids mom  with her crazy  talk and her  call in radio  show  okay now while 
[02:40:00]  you're laughing  on the dvd  of go  you can witness  hello  hello  listening on  hello  would you  stop it  you can witness  how they  completely changed  the ending  of that film  ah  all right  in the deleted  scenes answering  a question we  could have done  like 20 seconds  ago  right  yeah  if her hadn't  been  i like the  alternate endings  i remember what  was that one  with the stock  brokers there  boiler room  yeah yeah  boiler room  that was pretty  cool the  alternate ending 
[02:40:30]  that was a  great alternate  where giovanni  rabisi plays  the retarded  stockbroker  instead of  the retarded  soldier  the retarded  uh  retarded guy  the guy in  the gift  who's like  the hick from  hell  right  yeah you know  my daddy  done told me  he always plays  a slow gentleman  yeah he's not  a sharp  not the sharpest  guy but always  very entertaining  to watch  uh the film  final destination  on dvd  this is a really  mediocre film  yeah right  but the thing  is that a dvd  can't make a bad  film good  but it can make 
[02:41:00]  a bad film  interesting  and uh  on final destination  you get a half  hour long documentary  about how they  test market films  how they change  the ending  endings of film  that kind of  sounds a little  the director  of a writer  of a marketing  executive  that sounds a  little like  this segment  i don't know  kind of  hmm  kind of thing  what do you mean  i'm just thinking  it doesn't sound  like you know  kind of  i'm digging  the mr dvd  i know  no i am too  i'm just saying  it's kind of  you know 
[02:41:30]  i don't know  about marketing  of films  well i mean  it all depends  i mean if you're  just going to  watch a movie  on home  you know  dvd is the way  to go  because you get  the great picture  the great sound  the great x  oh yeah  i hate videos  now  i don't like  rewinding  yeah  uh i like  being able to  uh just go  to certain  segments of it  not have to  forward and  rewind and stuff  sure  yeah  i like the dvd  i previously  used my vcr  as a paperweight  now  a paperweight  yeah  can i uh go  to the phones  again  uh jim  you have a  question for  mr dvd  yeah mr dvd
