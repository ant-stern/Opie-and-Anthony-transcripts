<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, broadcasting from the high-security XM compound in Washington, D.C., began with significant technical difficulties, specifically a hilarious bout of feedback.  Dallas Cowboys center Tyson Walter, a returning guest from a previous New York broadcast, joined the hosts in the studio.  The conversation immediately veered into a series of outrageous anecdotes. Tyson recounted losing someone else's credit card at Scores, resulting in a nearly $50,000 charge.  Anthony confessed to a severe bout of flatulence that nearly emptied the studio.  A bizarre encounter with an overly familiar fan who tracked them down to their hotel bar and made inappropriate comments about their appearance and Ben's genitals was also shared.

The hosts then described their D.C. experiences, including witnessing a police shootout.  They discussed the building's security, highlighting the logistical challenges of leaving for food during a break.  The day's guest list was revealed, including the "odd" Andy Gore (a serial killer memorabilia collector), Lee Abrams, Bruce Kelly, Eric Logan, and the surprise appearance of Steve C.  A remix of U2's "Sunday Bloody Sunday" featuring George Bush's speeches was played.  Further discussion included Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up shows, Super Bowl predictions, jokes about Tyson's physique and luggage, and the purported weight-loss benefits of fidgeting. Opie's ongoing struggle with mice in his apartment was detailed, featuring increasingly elaborate and unsuccessful attempts at extermination, often involving garbage bags and humorous descriptions of the mice's movements.  This segued into a discussion about the Super Bowl, specifically the cancelled "I'm Going to Disney World" ad and a Budweiser commercial referencing Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction, leading to a broader conversation about American sensitivities regarding humor and sexuality. Bruce, Lee, and Eddie were noted as being in studio early.  Jimmy's habit of embarrassing Opie with overly affectionate nicknames was also mentioned.

Andy Gore then joined the show, detailing his obsessive-compulsive disorder, experiences in a mental institution, and his extensive collection of murderabilia, including items from John Wayne Gacy, Richard Ramirez, and Otis Toole. He recounted interactions with several convicted killers, a three-way call with Richard Ramirez included, and his eBay ban for selling murderabilia.  His collection of "pickled punks," deformed fetuses preserved in formaldehyde, was a significant focus, with descriptions of their names, the elaborate security measures to protect them, and their disturbing nature.  He mentioned their origin with Captain Harvey Boswell and the potential for future museum display.  A caller, Todd, inquired about selling a human skull, leading to a discussion on the legality and ethics of possessing human remains.  Opie gifted Andy a *People* magazine featuring Kurt Cobain.  The conversation shifted to the Iraqi elections, discussing voter turnout, insurgent activity, and the US's role in the conflict.  The Mad Mexican, an XM radio host, joined the show, discussing his program, quirky personality, and Eric Estrada's alleged fraudulent real estate ventures.  A promotional spot for a gay adult film was aired.


A further segment started with Opie recounting paranoid incidents involving hotel rooms and escorts.  Listener emails reacting to the show's political commentary, showcasing both pro- and anti-Bush sentiments, were read, with the hosts defending their non-partisan stance.  Andy Gore presented a mint-condition Kurt Cobain *People* magazine, photos of early Nirvana, and a Johnny Ramone-autographed hospital bracelet.  Coffee mugs featuring the Black Dahlia murder case were also displayed, leading to a discussion of the unsolved crime.  The hosts discussed their upcoming Mardi Gras broadcast in New Orleans, mentioning confirmed guests Tom from New Orleans, the Mad Mexican, and potentially Nathaniel the intern.  Bernie Getz and his potentially still-buried gun were discussed.  A call from Mike the trucker who found human remains in his basement was featured.  The surprising news of Barry Williams' divorce prompted humorous anecdotes about past interactions with Williams and his wife, including home visits, a New York dinner, and a food-related incident.  A planned translation of a Mad Mexican radio show segment and a preview of an old Mike Brady bit were mentioned.

The final segment began with a brief, unremarkable discussion of an email. This transitioned into a lengthy, sexually suggestive, and crude comedic bit imagining Mike Brady in various inappropriate situations with his children and Alice.  The latter half focused on a letter detailing the behind-the-scenes drama surrounding a controversial "tsunami song" on Hot 97 radio, alleging that producer Rick Delgado was being unfairly blamed, with Miss Jones and Todd Lynn being scapegoated.  The hosts speculated on Hot 97's management motivations.  Guests included the remote Jim Norton (who discussed his child's vaccinations), Lee Abrams, and Tyson Walter, who was in the studio.  Super Bowl discussion occurred again.  The show ended with advertisements for XM Radio and Major League Baseball.

[00:00:00]  Resort announces new daily non-stop flights from the West Coast.  Call 800-786-8259 for your Sun Valley ski vacation or visit sunvalley.com.  Well, we had a gorgeous weekend across the Northeast.  Alan Reitz was at Okemo in Vermont.  Well, we got a fast start to the day at Jackson Gore Base area.  Then it was off to the main mountains for some nice top-to-bottom shots on upper and lower World Cup.  I'll tell you, this is the week we've been waiting for.  You've got to get out there.  I'm Alan at Okemo.  Thanks, Alan.  Why not get out there to Sunday River, Maine, or Hunter Mountain, New York, with all their terrain open right now. 
[00:00:30]  Same deal, Massonaut in Virginia.  Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with some beautiful views of Mount Washington on almost every trail.  Let's go out west with Breckenridge and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 100%.  Park City, Utah, saw about three inches over the weekend.  So did Deer Valley, Utah.

[00:01:00]  You'll be an Anthony here at XM202.  I've got nothing.  I've got nothing.  I've got nothing.  I've got nothing.  About two.  Over 7-e standing in Mexico.  I've got nothing.  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Shut up.  And armed with superhuman powers.  He pulls his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage shed.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes, quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what? 
[00:05:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can act like a man! 
[00:06:00]  What's the matter with you?  It was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world!  Did you just say that? 
[00:06:30]  You can act like a man!  Did I just say that?  Yeah.  I didn't hit anything!  Now I just hit it.  Now listen.  We'll see if we get it.  See?  I'm hearing the delay.  Yeah, I hear it twice.  Wow, now I'm hearing myself talk.  It's creepy.  I'm not even laughing anymore, and I'm hearing myself laugh.  What is going on?  We're in feedback hell.  Are we like, this is us now? 
[00:07:00]  Can I try it again?  Yeah, go ahead.  Let's see.  Let's play this one.  Alright, there we are.  I think.  I think we're alive now.  Is it going to come back again?  No, because Jaime's on the scene, man.  Jaime is on it.  We're under control.  Finally.  Don't mind the sound.  You know, we were laughing because we were in feedback hell like you said, but to the listeners,  the listeners, they have no idea.  They had no idea what was going on, Anthony. 
[00:07:30]  To them, it all sounded completely normal.  They didn't hear it.  But we would talk, and then we'd hear ourselves in our headphones about seven seconds later.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't think I like it with the big puffy thing on it.  All of a sudden, my volume got lower or something.  Don't mind us people.  Just kind of straightening the show out.  We're just working out all the bugs.  That's good, Jaime.  Thank you, Jaime.  My thing creeps.  How is that for you, Jimmy?  Cool.  How does that sound?  I like it.  That's how it used to be in New York. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Earl-less.  Very good.  Look at us.  We're in Washington, D.C.  Yes, we are.  Yes.  Okay, I guess we're ready to broadcast, right, Jaime?  I think so.  Alright.  Yeah, we're live from Washington, D.C. at the XM compound.  Again, that means nothing to the listeners, because they're just listening to us.  That's the funny thing about taking a radio show on the road.  Yeah.  To the listeners, it's like, whatever, dudes.  What does it matter?  Just shut up and be funny. 
[00:08:30]  We don't care.  We could just say we're in Washington, screw around with some of the settings so it sounds  a little different, and then, you know, but we're still in New York.  You know, starting Wednesday when we're back in New York?  Every day, let's just make believe we're somewhere else.  Hey, live from Tampa Bay.  Alright, and then we'll just get the Tampa Bay newspaper, and we'll read some headlines,  make believe we're there.  Yeah.  Have some Tampa stories.  Yeah, have a Tampa story like we're, I don't know.  Where was that old lady again?  She was in Florida, but I'm not sure where.  Probably where old people hang out.  Where are they, Miami? 
[00:09:00]  West Palm.  West Palm.  Pretty much all of Florida.  I don't know.  Somewhere like that.  All right.  She was on a drawbridge, and the drawbridge started opening, and the old broad had a  grab on.  She had like some smarts to her.  She had to grab onto the railing on the edge of the bridge and hold onto it, or she  would have slid to her certain death.  And she was just kind of hanging there?  Help me!  How long was she up in the air hanging?  For a few minutes, until somebody ran into the booth that the operator was in and said, 
[00:09:30]  you've got an old broad hanging from the railing, you better put the bridge down.  That's classic.  Help me!  The little rascal rolling backwards.  So you're just holding on for dear life.  How short whatever's left of it is.  Some of these old people have superhuman strength, though.  Superhuman?  For old people?  Yeah, they think they're, you look at them and you think they're frail and stuff,  but they can still kick some serious ass.  Slow down.  They can hold on for their life on a drawbridge, perhaps. 
[00:10:00]  They're kicking ass.  All right.  Well, okay, here we are.  Yeah.  Jaime, you rock, man.  You got this whole studio together like that.  Now we're here.  We're here and we're going to do a radio show now, right?  Everybody's in good working order.  Yep.  Everyone's fine.  Well, had a little, and no problems getting here.  I noticed Opie wasn't on the train.  I decided to blow off the train and sleep in yesterday.  We all took the nooner in yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, I'll explain why I wasn't on the train.  It's because of this guy that's sitting to my left. 
[00:10:30]  He was on our show, what, Friday from New York.  Friday in New York, and now he's in D.C. with us.  It's Tyson Walter, who plays center for the Dallas Cowboys.  He came in to say hi to us Friday.  Next thing I know, I'm just drinking all night Saturday until like 3, 4 in the morning.  Dude, don't you know how football players drink?  Yeah.  It's insane.  Well, I was keeping up with him, too, because he drinks them out of tumblers.  Keeping up?  Tyson, was he really keeping up?  Yeah, he was keeping up. 
[00:11:00]  I did pretty well.  Jesus.  Is his mic on?  Yeah.  Red Bull and vodka, so, you know.  Poor man's speedball.  So it's real easy to go home at 3 in the morning and fall asleep, obviously.  3 in the morning is when you're supposed to be waking up.  Well, I know.  I know.  So, and then I remember talking to Tyson going, hey, man, we're all going to Washington.  Why don't you come down and do a road trip?  And next thing you know, like yesterday morning, I, let's go streaking!  Right.  I call him up at his hotel and he's like, dude, I'm all booked and ready to go. 
[00:11:30]  I'm like, oh, alright.  Oh, yeah.  We talked about that last night?  No, it's cool to have him here.  And then I go, well, you better rebook your train because I'm not leaving until at least 3.  At least 3.  At least.  You couldn't make the noon train because you were hungover.  No way.  Pretty much, yes.  Oh, brother.  Yeah, pretty much.  Oh, man.  You didn't even stay out the whole time, too.  I made it to, what, 3?  You made it to 3.  Because then he ends up at...  You were still hanging.  See, these guys are animals, man. 
[00:12:00]  Dude, he ended up at scores.  Oh, Jesus.  And then at Penn Station yesterday...  My friend's girlfriend wanted to go.  We're all like, we just want to sit here and listen to the band and drink.  If she's the one who wants to go, all right, whatever.  Tyson, eat that mic a little bit more.  He needs a little more volume.  That's great.  My fault.  Chicks always want to go to scores.  So him and his boys go to scores, I guess.  And then I'm at Penn Station, we're getting ready to get on the train, and he realizes  that he has someone else's credit card.  Yeah, they gave me the wrong credit card and driver's license.  I'm some guy from Colorado now with a crappy gold ATM card. 
[00:12:30]  And where is yours?  I don't know.  It doesn't matter.  Now I canceled it.  So...  You left it for the tab or something.  Yeah, I left for a tab.  At scores?  Yeah.  Uh-oh, I hope you canceled it quick enough.  There was another guy...  Oh, the scores.  Now, I'm not sure if it's a scam or not, but I know there was a guy at scores who said  that he rang up...  Scores told him he rang up...  It was over 50 grand?  Something like that?  Yes.  Over...  Jesus Christ, Jimmy!  What?  Holy shit!  No fucking way I'm dealing with this all day! 
[00:13:00]  What?  Jimmy, we're in the middle of telling a cute little story!  Wow!  Come on.  Wow!  The worst smell ever in my life!  Anthony is 10 feet away from the microphone right now.  It's still coming through.  It hasn't...  Holy Jesus!  I got this huge thing in front of me protecting from all smells, I guess, because I haven't  smelled it yet.  This is...  Oh my God!  It hit me!  Holy...  Holy shit!  It hasn't even gotten to my side yet.  Alright, I can't function.  So what happened?  Oh my God, shut up.  I can't function.  Get on the floor.  Get below it. 
[00:13:30]  Oh my God!  Dude, you're 35 years old!  Six.  36.  36 years old.  What are you doing?  I had a burger on the Metroliner yesterday.  Oh my God!  I'm gonna puke!  He ain't laughing.  Oh my God, dude!  It's...  Oh my God!  It's...  Oh my God!  Anthony is wrapped up like a Shiite Muslim.  Yeah, I got my scarf around my face.  Oh my God, it just...  Oh my God!  It won't go away!  It won't leave!  Dude, that's horrific. 
[00:14:00]  Oh Jesus!  It finally made it over the console in front of me.  Kind of like...  It's still here.  It finally made it's way over the mountains and into the desert over here.  Holy S.  It's still here!  Dude, open that door, Lee.  It's gonna be too cold in here.  No, it's like...  Over the door.  It's not lying.  It could be the worst one ever.  It's like rotting eggs.  It won't stop.  Oh, see?  Look at beautiful Megan.  She has to smell your gas.  That is disgusting.  Whoa! 
[00:14:30]  Is there any Lysol or any type of air freshener around?  Not in D.C.  Nope.  I need something I'm gonna throw up.  It's gone.  No, it isn't.  It isn't gone.  No, it's not.  It's in my nostrils.  And you sit there all proud and happy.  Drinking more coffee.  With yourself.  Well, I had a burger on the metro line.  I think that's what did it yesterday.  That rotten cheeseburger.  Oh!  Anyway.  Oh my God!  Forget it.  He completely wiped out any memory I had of what I was talking about.  Something to do with scores?  It won't stop. 
[00:15:00]  It's awful.  It really is awful.  I'm gonna punch you in your fat face.  No, it's good.  Oh, please, Tyson.  Kill him.  It happened once a while.  I just get nervous.  Anyway, back to the score story.  Oh, right.  So you knew of a guy?  Yeah, it was in the paper.  Fifty grand.  And scores said, no, you chalked up $50,000 worth of charges.  Champagne like he was buying Cristal for the dancers.  Really?  Yeah, just chalked up $50,000. 
[00:15:30]  And he said, I didn't do it.  And it was his word against the establishment.  And they had his credit card and everything.  And they stuck him with the bill.  And they took him to court and everything.  The guy, they didn't have a leg to stand on.  And I'm thinking maybe, you know, a situation like that where...  Well, how he was explaining the story, I could see how this happened.  Because it's what?  You were saying it's dark?  It's dark as hell.  I've only got one hand that I can use, really.  And so they bring it back.  I can't even see the damn card.  And I just sign it and stuff it in my pocket because it's too messy to fumble with my wallet. 
[00:16:00]  So I don't realize until the next day.  The difference is, though, what you're talking about, Ant's talking about.  It happened two times.  Two different guys had this happen.  One was almost $100,000.  Ridiculous.  But those guys actually had the witnesses, all the dancers, saying, yeah, this guy was in the champagne room.  Like, I think he was really there because they had a whole evening of...  You don't think the dancers are all in cahoots with the club owner, too?  Oh, yeah, that's true.  What, are they going to say, no, the club owner is wrong?  Well, they must have had too many details right, because for some reason he, I don't know, I think he actually did it.  Sounds like it would be a great scam, you know, because they could check on the cards, you know? 
[00:16:30]  They probably have security cameras, too, though.  Yeah, true, true.  I had a friend that had the same problem with scores.  Real.  $5,000 bill on, like, $400.  The guy took clients, yeah, and he had the same exact thing happen.  They give you a different card.  He took out clients, and they got the bill, and now he's fighting it with American Express.  It was an Amex card.  I was on with Amex last night going through every single charge that had been made in the last, like, three days, and everything's kosher so far.  Oh, damn. 
[00:17:00]  They shot it down right away.  Look at me.  Damn.  I want the update in, like, two weeks when you get your statement.  $10,000?  Cowboys football player in, like, Scores scandal.  That'd be great.  I had a prostitute rip me off like that one time, though.  Years ago, I used to use credit cards.  Some of these places would take credit cards.  You're a madman.  Dude, I didn't know any better.  I was coming in from Jersey and did $150 on the credit card, and I think one of them was for $10,000, and one was for, like, $6,000, but the credit card company took it right off.  For whatever reason, they saw that it wasn't my spending, and they took it off. 
[00:17:30]  They actually did it.  Yeah, they'll do that sometimes.  Yeah, they're pretty good with that.  Wow.  Well, yeah, so we took a later train, and here we are.  I mean, I got to the hotel just in time to crash.  I was in bed, like, at 7.30 last night.  Seven effing 30.  I was out a little late.  A little late last night, like 9.30.  Oof.  I'm a madman.  I'm crazy.  I was in the hotel bar with Ben.  Yeah, we were checking into the hotel, and they're talking about how, you know, if you want some dinner, you know, the restaurant area will be open until 10.00. 
[00:18:00]  And I'm looking at them.  We say this all the time, like, are you insane?  It's the middle of the night.  I know.  Why are you still serving food?  Yeah, but then, you see what room service is and the food is?  What?  It's like on a ditto in your room.  I was hoping for, you know, I was hoping for, excuse me, room service.  Thank you.  Could you please send up a roasted chicken?  And no, it's like a ditto with burgers and, like, bar food on it.  Huh.  So we didn't get any of that.  But we hung out in the bar, and we saw Ben come strolling in. 
[00:18:30]  Had a couple of beers with the Benster.  And while we're sitting there, there's some guy kind of staring at us.  We're talking, and some guy at the bar is just staring at us.  Got, like, a shaved head.  Kind of looked like a lunatic.  I already know where this is going.  He leans over and says something to Ben.  What did he say to you?  He goes, excuse me, can I ask you a question?  See, he came in.  He came in, and I saw him looking at me, and he couldn't see you sitting down.  Anthony was on a big sofa. 
[00:19:00]  And he looked at me, and I was like, this guy looks like he wanted to kill me or something.  And he looked like the lead singer of Disturbed, shaved head, big huge dude.  So he sat at the end of the bar, and I was standing talking to Anthony, and he kept looking over.  And I'm like, what the hell is this guy's problem?  And he finally said, excuse me, can I ask you a question?  He goes, shouldn't you be herking and jerking?  And then he started, he goes, thanks to your brilliant guy, Eric.  I knew where you guys were staying.  I drove all the way from Baltimore.  See, Eric?  Eric's back in New York rolling his eyes right now.  Now you understand.  I understand. 
[00:19:30]  The guy said, I heard Eric say where you guys were going to be.  He mentioned the hotel.  And he goes, then I know you guys canceled, because I was listening to the show, and you  weren't going to be there last weekend.  So he goes, when you said you were going to be here this weekend, I figured I'd make the  drive from Baltimore, like 40 minute drive, and just sit in the hotel bar waiting for us.  And, you know, knowing us, especially me and Ben, we were going to be in the bar.  And there he was.  He sat there kind of covertly listening to our conversation for a good half hour before 
[00:20:00]  he said anything.  And there we are just bad-mouthing everybody in the business.  And he's sitting there.  And, yeah, then he perked up.  But it's kind of awkward, because we don't know him.  But there he is, like, knowing everything about all of us that people know through the show.  So he mentions the first thing he says is herky-jerking.  And then it's like, Ben, your hair is a mess.  And, yeah, he's just talking about things. 
[00:20:30]  And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he's like, hey, what about your big delicious hog?  And we look at him like, you know, that's a little uncomfortable, my friend.  You know, when there's mics in front of us, and we're talking about Ben's delicious huge mule.  It's one thing.  When it's some stranger at a bar talking about your schlong.  And he was a big intimidating guy.  He's like, where's Jim?  Like, why come Jim's not down there?  And I'm like...  Where's Jim?  Jim has the sign on his door.  What did it say?  Like, leave me alone or something.  Which is, yeah, whatever the Do Not Disturb sign is. 
[00:21:00]  I was in bed by 6.45.  You guys were out partying and causing a problem.  I'm in bed being responsible.  I think Ben told him your room number or something.  That's fine.  I gave him Steve's room number.  I gave him Steve's room number.  I gave him Steve's room number.  I don't know what you want.  Please leave me alone.  I'm trying to sleep.  Steve had to dye his hair after he killed one of the socials.  He's remaining golden.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, so we had that to deal with in the hotel bar. 
[00:21:30]  Because Eric decided it was a good idea to blurt out the name of the hotel we're staying at.  And no one hates that more than Ben.  No one hates that privacy invasion more than him.  It drives him nuts.  When Eric did say it, Ben was the first one.  Oh!  Oh, dude.  Oh, dude.  Just loses his mind.  Hurt and jerks.  You can always tell when he's exasperated because he actually jerks and moves less than normal.  He kind of slows down.  He's thinking about how pissed he is.  Can you hear this mic? 
[00:22:00]  It feels like it's going in and out.  Does it sound normal to you guys?  No, it sounds normal.  Okay, cool.  Everything sounds great now, man.  It's a little weird at first just to get used to.  And then it does.  I'm noticing it goes in and out.  I'm just mesmerized because all the meters in front of me here are perfect.  Really?  Absolutely perfect.  Not like back home.  Oh, my God.  You've got to see our meters back home, man.  They're all over the ball field, but here they're perfect.  Don't come over here again with that rancid ass of yours.  I didn't actually do it over there before.  Which is what happens. 
[00:22:30]  I just got a little bit nervous because we're in the new facility and stuff.  Shut up.  It happened.  Nervous.  The drive over here.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Just when you think the stereotypes of the neighborhood around here might be fake.  Yeah, they pick us up at the hotel that we will not name, Eric, in the Opie and Anthony  van with our cartoon faces on the side.  Oh, embarrassing.  Just like you're getting into a retard van.  It's just awful. 
[00:23:00]  Cartoon music should be playing as you get into that.  Ba-doop, ba-doop.  Little molested children should be spilling out the back.  Well, I agree.  All kidding aside.  Just awful.  So, we make the ride over to the XM compound, which we've told our listeners about since we  started here at XM.  It's in the middle of the ghetto.  It's gated.  It's in the middle of the security fence.  It's got a security fence.  Hey.  It's really...  Yeah, it's a little rough in the neighborhood.  As soon as you get through the security fences, you're good.  Nothing's going to happen to us.  You feel safe.  As we're in here.  You know? 
[00:23:30]  But on the way over, we're driving, I don't even know what road, whatever, and we stopped  at a light.  We didn't even really stop at a light, right?  We were just kind of tooling along?  No, we kind of go through the lights.  You've got to worry about roadside bombs and insurgent fire.  See, that's the problem.  We're like, Megan, why are you stopping for lights?  Why?  Oh, right, yeah.  She was stopping.  Five in the morning yet.  Why are you stopping for lights in Chocolate City, especially?  Lights are so...  Ah.  You don't pay attention to them at that hour in the morning.  No.  You really don't have to. 
[00:24:00]  The rule should be, you know, before 5.30, you're allowed to do whatever you want out  there.  It's a slow roll.  You look both ways.  You go.  You feel safe.  It looked like some homies were doing whatever they wanted.  Why can't we do whatever we wanted?  Yeah, that was a little rough.  So we're just, you know, tooling along, and I look out the passenger window and I go,  Oh, wow!  Cool!  Shooting!  Yeah.  And Megan's like, just slows down and stops.  She slowed down a little.  Yeah, so we could turn and look at the shooting.  We actually saw...  We don't know what we saw, but...  Cops, dogs, guns out. 
[00:24:30]  Cops, dogs, and guns out.  I saw one of the cops, like, crouching behind a mailbox.  Yeah, well...  And he was looking into a store.  One guy was behind one of the parking meters trying to protect himself.  Covered behind a parking meter.  They all had their guns out, and there was a dog, and that's all we know.  And I just said, wow, cool shooting.  And Megan just slows down to check it out.  I'm like, no, no, that should be the cue to speed up.  Well, that's because she had to stop less than a block away at the Rite Aid to pick up  the newspapers for the show to try to get the newspapers. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, because we're such divas, we needed our New York papers.  And did you notice who we made get out of the van?  Megan.  Megan.  We made the girl get out of the van to go check the door to get the newspapers  because there were cops with guns out.  Yeah, only a block away.  We're not kidding.  Like, four homos were just cowering in the van, hoping everything's okay.  We're laying on the floor.  Yeah, we're not an easy target with the van with our cartoon faces on the side.  Send the girl out.  And that Rite Aid wasn't open. 
[00:25:30]  And we're not sure if that Rite Aid was being taken over and there was a hostage situation.  And we don't know.  We don't know if there was guys with guns right on the other side of the door to the side.  Just a little creepier around here at night.  It was really weird.  And then we got here, obviously.  Obviously.  But the shooting, that was something.  It happens around here.  It's what I hear.  I don't know.  I'm not too familiar with the D.C. area, though.  I kind of know around the hotel because last night we went to dinner around there. 
[00:26:00]  And I know the XM area, but I just know it because we drive into a big gate and that's all I ever see.  And then the tourist things, you know, you see the Washington Monument, things like that.  But as far as, I couldn't tell you where to walk around and where not to.  I guess if there's cops with guns out, now I know.  I've been educated you not to walk around that area.  That could be an area to avoid.  Avoid the area where cops with dogs and guns out are strolling about.  How far away from the White House where we're staying or where we are now? 
[00:26:30]  I have no idea where we are.  That's what it is.  I don't know D.C.  I found a little map in the room and I was kind of looking at it.  We're kind of far away from things, I think.  Just ask Ben.  This is Ben's expertise.  He knows all this crap.  In the cab, though, he knows.  Ben knows D.C., though, too?  I know we're...  He knows Boston.  I know we're a short cab ride from Georgetown, I believe, right?  Yeah.  Jim and I and Steve went to dinner in Georgetown last night, so it's not far.  It was like, what, ten minutes?  Yeah.  Not even.  It wasn't bad.  I'm trying to act like I kind of live here.  And I'm like, I don't want to...  I'm like, yeah, you take me to the...  We went to Morton's.  Take me to Morton's and whatever. 
[00:27:00]  And I almost said it here, so he wouldn't try to rip me off.  Ah.  But one question, I would have been sunk.  So I'm like, hey, New York.  Actually, though...  We should have a nice long ride around town.  Yeah, all of a sudden he takes a sharp turn.  Yeah.  I'm from New York.  Wait, wasn't...  That said M-O-R-T.  Wait.  Yes, my friend.  Yes, my friend.  I take the shortcut.  The...  We're not that far from the White House.  We're like ten blocks.  Really?  Isn't everything like ten blocks from the White House?  Well, I asked the cab driver last night, because we were on Pennsylvania Avenue when I was  coming back, and he said the White House is that way. 
[00:27:30]  You could see the Capitol, and you could see the Marshall Market.  I hate you guys, by the way.  Why?  I said I would eat dinner with you.  We were...  Dude, I was in...  You guys ate at Morton's, and Tyson and I ate at the train station.  That restaurant's not bad.  You want to?  It's not bad, but there's this restaurant in the middle of the train station.  They're trying to make it look like it's a real nice restaurant.  Yeah.  And I go to Tyson.  You know what?  I remember being at this hotel.  I don't know if there's anywhere to eat around that area, and it was sort of getting  a little later, because I got on a later train, and I didn't want to get  stuck in trying to figure out where to eat hell, you know what I mean? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  So I'm like, you know, why don't we cut our losses and eat here?  It's a major city.  There's plenty of restaurants.  Dude, yeah.  I called...  But that's why I was calling you.  Your phone didn't work inside once.  You guys know...  Well, especially you.  You know this crap, so I'm like, alright, I'll get Ben on the phone.  He'll tell us where we could eat.  I don't know.  So, whatever.  So I could have had a porterhouse, but I got a Reuben and said thanks.  How was your train station cooking?  It was alright.  It was alright.  We had steaks.  It was great.  But the problem is, it was in the big concourse area, and so everyone that's going outside  to get their cabs, it was freezing, because the doors were constantly open. 
[00:28:30]  And they're all smoking.  That's the other thing, when you sit here...  You're so used to New York now, without the smoking.  And that restaurant, because I ate there last Monday, everyone was smoking around me.  The place you ate at.  Yeah, I got back to the room last night, after hanging out in the lounge downstairs,  and just reeked of smoke.  Well, we were saying this in the lobby of the hotel.  Washington, D.C. will be the last city that goes down as far as the non-smoking thing  goes, with all the smoking lobbyists down here.  Well, the South is huge tobacco in the South, you know? 
[00:29:00]  Right.  Where they make their money, so they really...  Down here, you're not going to get a lot of laws against smoking.  Weird, because we've discussed this many times, I'm all for establishments deciding  if they want to allow smoking, and then you, as the patron, decide if you want to eat there.  I think it's as simple as that.  But I'm pretty happy that it's all smoke-free in New York, because then you get reminded,  like you said last night in the bar area, you know?  But it's just a ridiculous law that they're telling you that a substance that is legal, 
[00:29:30]  you're not allowed to have in your establishment.  That just amazes me.  When I did Zany's in Chicago, you can still smoke in that club.  Like, I got so used to New York clubs, I forgot how bad it is.  Yeah.  Because I smoked for 17 years, so I'm not being self-righteous, but it just affects you.  I got a sore throat from it.  I'm like, I'm not used to being around smoke anymore.  Yeah, your eyes start burning.  Oh my God.  You're hacking.  And now I wear my clothes three or four times in a row now.  You just have to wash everything after every single night.  Every single night.  When we go on these road trips and go to places where people can smoke, you get home and open 
[00:30:00]  up your luggage, and it's just this waft of smoke.  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  All right.  Yeah, not down here, though.  They won't do that for a while.  This will be the last city to go.  That's obvious.  All right.  I think we got the bugs figured out.  We're in Washington, D.C. at the XM compound.  Jaime's doing a great job for us down here.  We love the Jaime.  Yeah, Jaime always does a good job.  He knows what he's doing.  Of course he does.  Well, we have a real buffer between the front door and the big window, so we won't be on 
[00:30:30]  display.  Yeah, I like that.  I kind of like that.  Okay.  What are we doing on the show today?  We have a hell of a guest list, I'll tell you that much.  Do we?  Strap yourselves in, folks.  Big guest day.  All right.  Why don't you read the guests off, Jimmy?  We want to blow it?  All right.  Well, we'll start off with our old friend, Andy Gore.  All right.  And he's coming by.  Yeah.  And we have...  Wait.  Andy Gore is...  We've got to explain, man.  He's a freak of nature.  Yeah.  He's very paranoid.  So I'm amazed that he's actually going to come into this facility with some of his things. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, he's a very odd guy.  Yeah.  Old friend of the show.  He's kind of like Ted Bundy in a weird way, except he doesn't kill women, but he'd probably  like to.  Yeah.  We really don't know if he's ever killed anyone.  Yeah, he's a psychopath.  No offense with that, but...  Is he bringing stuff with him?  I'm hoping.  He collects a lot of serial killer memorabilia.  Yeah, he's nuts.  He loves it.  He's got letters from serial killers that he wrote to.  Does he have a Gacy painting?  I don't know.  Does he really?  Yeah, I think he's got a sketch or something, yeah.  He's got something.  He sent me a signed copy of Deep Throat. 
[00:31:30]  Linda...  It was before she was killed, so I had this...  Really?  Remember in DC when we did last time, he brought me a signed Deep Throat, which is on display.  Linda Lovelace.  Yeah, before she was killed.  Wow.  Why did I have to say before she was killed?  Is that not fairly obvious?  Fat tits.  We also have on the program today, we have Lee Abrams coming in.  Oh.  That's right, folks.  And it gets better.  We have Bruce Kelly, and our guest list here is...  Bruce Kelly does the 80s station here.  Oh!  Yeah.  And we also have... 
[00:32:00]  Eric Logan will be the headline guest.  You will.  Just going to be a hell of a show, folks.  Just strap yourselves in.  Guests...  Wow.  ...all day.  That is star-studded.  Everyone from Lee Abrams to Eric Logan.  That's right.  I understand we're going to have the security guard stop in, too, as a special treat,  and the guy that works outside in the parking lot.  That's the beautiful thing about XM.  You don't need celebrity guests.  They all just work here.  Just, you know, have them file in.  Thank God we have a professional talent booker that's working for us full-time.  Oh, she is terrific, because I understand that... 
[00:32:30]  Well, she actually tried to get us some people from Sirius, and we're like, no, no, no.  Wrong company.  Oh, what a heck of a job she's doing.  Oh, I'm just getting something in here.  The parking lot guy had to cancel.  He forgot his security badge at home, so he can't get in the building.  So he's canceling.  This place really is like Fort Knox.  Yeah.  It is tough to get around here.  Did you notice when we first walked in, I want to ask Megan about this.  They had...  There's a big, like, almost like a get smart type of metal door, which I think will close  in case...  Not that people outside would behave badly. 
[00:33:00]  Security breach.  Yeah.  But in case there's any kind of a problem, this metal thing can just shut down, close,  and keep anybody from getting in.  You're saying if there's some type of riot outside...  Oh, no, I'm not saying that, but just say that, you know...  They can close the whole complex down.  Say everybody in the neighborhood is just like dancing or having fun at once, and it looks like a riot.  Are you sure that there would never be a riot outside the facility?  Of course not.  But they could close it down, you know, like the big mountain there in Colorado.  Yeah, exactly.  Norad.  Norad, exactly.  Norad.  All of a sudden the doors just close and it's over. 
[00:33:30]  This can actually survive a nuclear blast.  Yeah, yeah.  This whole place can actually be at ground zero.  And then Eric Logan will come over, hello, Joshua.  Hey, what's up?  Did our food arrive?  Yes.  Okay, good.  Would you like to get a drink?  Would you like a bagel?  Well, go get it yourself.  There are no interns.  Alright, here's the next problem.  We're going to break for exactly 45 seconds, because that's how long our breaks are. 
[00:34:00]  And in that time...  What do I do?  In that time, we're going to have to somehow run upstairs, get bagels and food.  Oh, good luck.  Good luck.  And we have to get through three security, like, doors to get ups.  How are we going to do this?  It's going to be like a crime movie, where they have to do something in like less than  a minute, and it's got to be perfectly choreographed.  Like Mission Impossible, kind of, when he's going down and the guy's coming back.  Yeah.  And then we've got to slide in, get in our chairs right when the mics are potted up and 
[00:34:30]  go, hi, we're back.  A little sweat drips off the head of Ben's big delicious hog and sets off the security.  All right, well, in honor of being in D.C., why don't we play the George Bush Sunday Bloody  Sunday remix, okay, Anthony?  Oh, that'll give us a little time, won't it?  Maybe three minutes to go get eggs and bagels and stuff.  Nice. 
[00:35:00]  So if you're a new listener to the brand new Opie and Anthony program, basically this  guy, I would love to give him credit.  They're coming on the show.  Oh, this is Jib Jam?  Yeah, they're coming on tomorrow.  Okay, and they're going to be in studio tomorrow.  Sure they are.  Basically, they took George Bush's speeches and they found the lyrics to Sunday Bloody Sunday  by U2 and they threw this together.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song.  This song is Sunday Bloody Sunday. 
[00:35:30]  I can't believe the news today.  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long?  How long must we sing this song?  How long?  Too, too, too long.  For too long.  Tonight?  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Broken bottles under children's feet.  Body's turned across the damn streets. 
[00:36:00]  But I won't need to battle Paul.  It puts my back up.  It puts my back up against the wall.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  And the battle's just begun  This many lost and tell who has won 
[00:36:30]  The transistor within our hearts  Mothers, children, brothers, sisters, born apart  Sunday, bloody Sunday  Sunday, bloody Sunday  How long, how long must we sing this song?  How long, too long, too long  Tonight  We can be as one  Tonight, tonight, tonight  Sunday, bloody Sunday  Sunday, bloody Sunday 
[00:37:00]  Let's roll it  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online  The web address is not very imaginative  But it's easy to remember  Card, card, dot, dot  Wipe the tears from your eyes  Wipe your tears away  Wipe your tears away  Wipe your tears away  Wipe your much eyes 
[00:37:30]  Sunday, bloody Sunday  Sunday, bloody Sunday  Sunday, bloody Sunday  Sunday, bloody Sunday  Sunday, bloody Sunday  Let's roll  And it's true, not a meme  One fact is fiction and TV reality  And today the millions rock 
[00:38:00]  We eat and drink while tomorrow they die  Sunday play Sunday  Sunday play Sunday  Sunday play Sunday  Sunday play Sunday  Life in corporate America can be a grind  All they do is they remove the humor from everything  And you don't want to worry about your behavior around the office becoming a problem 
[00:38:30]  I'm standing here with this erection feeling silly  You're gonna need some sound advice  Talk less and suck more  From a qualified professional  I'm a stand-up comic who hates his own guts  New from the Hiv Corporation  It's the Jim Norton Sensitivity Handbook  Sensitivity training  Maybe you can send someone from Human Resources in  And they can tickle my bag a little  I can go, ooh, very sensitive area  And then they can leave  Jim will help you construct a business plan  Greed is good

It's Anthony  It's Jim Norton  It's Tyson Walter  From the Dallas Cowboys  I got a lot of crap  On the message boards, Anthony  Because  Norton and I  Have been friends with Tyson 
[00:42:30]  For a couple years now  When we did what we did  And we didn't do radio  For a couple years  I just wandered  Around America  Sometimes following  Our comedian friends  As they did their gigs  I'm going to walk the earth  And that's pretty much  What I did  Like King from Kung Fu  Pretty much  Pretty much  You know  I followed Lynch  For a little while  Most of the time  Norton would call me up  Hey, I'm going to San Francisco  Alright, I'll go  Whatever  And we were in Dallas  And we met Tyson  And we've known him for a while 
[00:43:00]  And I keep saying  Tyson Walters  Tyson Walters  And someone's like  Wow, he must be a real  Good friend of O.B.'s  He doesn't even know  His last name  It's Tyson Walter  That must happen a lot though, right?  It happens everywhere I go  Or they flip my names  Or they say Walter Tyson  Yeah  Either one  Well, Walters is such a common last name  You don't hear Walter as often  So that's not a big faux pas  It's the Donna Summer  Donna Summers thing  Exactly  Yeah  How many times has Ben Spark  Had that happen to him?  That's great 
[00:43:30]  Ben Spark  Here's another one  We had  What's his name  From the  The Counting Crows  Oh yeah  Last week  And they're trashing me  Dick, it's Counting Crows  Not the  It's like Scorpions  It's Scorpions  I call them the Scorpions  But everyone calls them the Scorpions  No, it's just Scorpions  Dude, I did rock radio  For a real long time  Coming out of a Scorpions song  It was  The Scorpions  That's the Scorpions  Yeah  Right  It doesn't sound right  That was Scorpions  I know 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, it just sounds stupid  It's ridiculous  But then again  The Kiss  God, when I was a kid  I would hear people say  The Kiss  It would make me sick  It's not The Kiss  No, we should  Take advantage of having Tyson in studio  I mean, what's your feel on the Super Bowl, bro?  Gotta pick New England  Yeah  Yeah  You gotta relax  They had stats from Philly  On teams that have won in Philly  And they had to just go to  To like these bad lacrosse 
[00:44:30]  Like indoor lacrosse  And it's like, yeah  They were champs in Philly  In indoor lacrosse  Arena football  I don't even know  It was like  It was like these sports  That no one watches  Or cares about  No one in Philly  Has ever won a championship?  What about like the Phillies, no?  It's been a while  It's been like 68  Yeah, it was like  Within 25 years or something  So they're kind of  They're hard pressed  To get a championship team in there  It's funny  And this year, forget it  It's gotta be the Pats, right? 
[00:45:00]  Just stomping everything  Well, the big story is  Will Terrell Owens play  Or is it Terrell Owen?  Owen Terrell?  They had video of him  Getting off the plane, I guess  In Jacksonville  I don't even know  In the paper or whatever  Yeah  You could tell that the guy  Could barely walk  But they're still saying  Will he be ready for Sunday's  Super Bowl?  He might be playing it up a little bit  Limping a little more than he should  To kind of  Playing a little possum, huh?  A little rope-a-dope  Maybe he could put on  A bloody sock  So it looks really bad 
[00:45:30]  I don't know  Get out there  Look like a hero  Do the old  Curt Schilling thing  Right  So you don't think  The Eagles have a shot, huh?  I'm not gonna say  They don't have a shot  They're a good team  And they've got  A great defense  You know  And like they said  Baltimore did a couple years ago  With their defense  So if their defense  Could really step up  And carry them  I think  They have a chance  To keep it close  But I think  New England's just been  They're on a roll, man  Yeah  And it's hard  Hard to beat a team like that  Especially with their coordinators  Probably both leaving now  And it's gonna be a hard 
[00:46:00]  Hard team to beat  Yeah  Why are they leaving?  Are they both gonna get  Head coaching jobs?  Yeah, one's going to  Notre Dame  And Cornell  Is gonna go to Cleveland  Looks like  Notre Dame  Why would you walk off  A Super Bowl champion  With the offensive  Or defensive coordinator?  Offensive voices  Going to Notre Dame  Why would you go to  Notre Dame for  Well, I guess  Two million bucks a year  Guaranteed for five years  And you get to be the man  You get to be your own guy there  You're the man  Yeah  I like not being the man though  There's no pressure  You just hang out  Right?  Isn't that great?  I thought this was  Norton and Friends  Well, it is

Ten jumping jacks  Ten jumping jacks  I swear to God  1953  Yeah, he got his exercise program  From what the kids used to do  On one drama  That's fantastic  Ten jumping jacks  No, that exercise program  Was do a bunch of sit-ups  And then cry  And pretend that Bob McAllister  Didn't do what he did  To get you on the show  Pretend your little bottom  Doesn't hurt  Can you do a jumping jack  Can't sit on that  Schwinn bicycle  You just won

[00:49:00]  And I'm like  If these guys could see me  I would love to see  Ten jumping jacks  How about an exercise  From this century?  I mean  Wow  That's only five years ago  What new exercises do they have?  Really?  No, no  Jumping jacks?  I'm going to bring this routine  To Parcells and see what he says  No, Bill  I'm doing Jim Norton's workout  I'm only doing ten jumping jacks  And taking it to the house  The Jim Norton workout?  Get the hell out of here  Ten jumping jacks  And then smell your belly button  End of workout  I'm going to get you  A Jane Fonda workout tape  It's ten jumping jacks  And then crying  In front of the mirror  Well, the Jane Fonda workout 
[00:49:30]  Would be to do ten sit-ups  But on top of a tank  Wow  All right  Well, sure  There you go  That's good  It's funny  Because I was  At dinner  I was talking to Tyson  About working out and stuff  And he's going  Oh, yeah, man  I'm so thin  I haven't been to the gym  Because he messed up his wrist  The last game of the season  Against the Giants  So, what?  You haven't been to the gym?  And he's like  Yeah, dude  I can feel my bones  And everything in my arms  Look out 
[00:50:00]  He's a freaking house  I look like I've got him, man  Oh, yeah  Horrible  Yeah, on what planet?  You don't need to work out  Just carry that luggage  His bag has a cadaver in it  I've never felt heavier luggage  Every piece of clothing  Is like a tent, though  So I'm carrying around  Like 50 little tents  You don't think about that  Yeah, his clothes are huge  So when you pack for a few days  His luggage is going to be  A lot heavier than anybody else's  Yeah, and one pair of his jeans  Equals like five of mine, you know  It was just depressing, though  Because it was so big, the bag  It's like one of those 
[00:50:30]  Fold-over garment bags  I'm like, this is a man's luggage  Oh, Jimmy tried to pick it up  But he couldn't  I couldn't  It's going to take a lot more  Jumping jacks  Before you could pick that up  I was trying to help him  Because he has a bad hand  So I'm like, I'll hand him his luggage  As he gets out of the van  But I was just like, all right, well  He's strained  Hope your other hand works  His jumping jacks  Now you're working out  Like those black and white films  From the 50s  Here's Jimmy exercising  Laugh all you want  Tomorrow, maybe 11 or 12  And then we'll see  Who looks good tomorrow  Are you going to throw that big medicine ball 
[00:51:00]  Back and forth with somebody  What's that thing  That huge oversight  Yeah, the big medicine ball  Well, it'll be a great workout  To kneel and then just lift Ben's mule  Over my head ten times  Or to curl it  Now slow down  That's pretty heavy  I read something today  Steve found some article  That moving around  They say fidgeting  Actually helps you lose weight 
[00:51:30]  You burn a lot of calories  If you're naturally fidgety  And they said people that  Stand up, move around  Twitch  And throw their arms about  A lot  Per day  Lose a lot more weight  And a lot of obese people  Don't do these things  Why are we all looking at Ben  As you tell this  The article just completely described  What Ben does on a daily basis  Actually, I saw this on CBS News  When I was getting ready this morning  There's this guy that claims  That this study works 
[00:52:00]  And he only works like standing up now  And they were suggesting this to people  The guy works on a treadmill  He put his computer in front of him  On a treadmill  And he works every day  For ten hours a day  At .7 miles per hour  So he's constantly walking  As he's working on his computer  How slow is that .7?  That's a teeny little page  It's a walk  You're just slowly  I think it's a very slow  Very slow walk  But he says it beats sitting down  For ten hours a day  He's got to relax  That's overachieving 
[00:52:30]  Constantly walking  You want to just put a little machine  On your feet  So when you sleep  It makes it look like you're walking  That ass  Just exercise once in a while  Exactly  That's overachieving  Ben Hastenbull  He's like a shark  If he stops  He just drowns in the air  He's got to keep the air circulating  Over his gills  A person is apt to  The difference between being obese  Or lean  Maybe due to how much a person  Is apt to stand  Pace  Wriggle  And shift about  Over the course of the day  If that doesn't describe  Our Ben  Who lost weight actually 
[00:53:00]  He's actually slim now  He looks good  He just herked  And jerked his way  To slimness  He's doing alright  I have a mouse update  Anthony  A lot of people are following  The saga that is  My lonely apartment  I actually did a photoshop  And put it on  On Wackbag  Before I left on Friday  You're photoshopping  Of you  My problems  I'm photoshopping  Subjects of the show  Like everyone else  On Wackbag  And I throw it up there  It was you  Superimposed on the cover 
[00:53:30]  Of the movie Willard  And it's got  It's got your face  In the shadows  Holding the rat Ben  Up by your nose  And it says something  Like a special relationship  And it says  Greg Hughes  As Willard  That's great  Have you seen Willard?  Yeah  So the new one  With Chris the remake  He's just a creepy dude  He really is a creep  What did you have  Did you actually have  The rat's face  Or did you put  Little Ben's face on it  That would have been funny  Because it is Ben  The rat  And I didn't think of that  Of course it's big 
[00:54:00]  And fat  You know  So wait  You're kind of  Breeding with all the other rats  Because it's got  Such a big mule  Your intelligence amazes me  Oh thank you  And you're constantly  In my head  Oh thank you  Remember Friday  I was talking about  How I caught the second mouse  Yeah  It was rustling in the garbage  As I was getting ready  At four in the morning  And I had to go outside  It was five degrees  With literally no clothes on  And I threw the garbage out  And then the little fellow  Ran away  Right  And then you were like  Telling me on Friday 
[00:54:30]  Because I was all happy  Because that was the second mouse  I'm like ha ha ha  Got him  And then you brought up  Some kind of study  Or some  I don't know where you get  Your stupid knowledge from  But it's always correct  I hate you for that  I really do  He knows a little bit  About everything  I read a lot of stupid stuff  The guy never even graduated  High school  And he's smarter  Than just about everyone  I've ever met in my life  It's disgusting  Didn't need no high school  Jack of all trades  Master of none  Am I right or wrong  That's right  So then he's like  Well I've read  What do you read about  Mice? 
[00:55:00]  Sometimes I go off  The porn sites  But basically you were saying  That these mice  They know how to get back  To their lair I guess  Yeah if they had  A nice set up  Nice warmth  And some food  They'll find a way  To get back  Especially if you just  Toss them a few feet  Out your door  To kind of remember  How to get back in  He's just opening the door  Going now go  Now go  Get  Shoo  No  The big gap  From what Ben tells me  There's a huge gap  Underneath Opie's door 
[00:55:30]  Which door?  To your place  I don't know  That's not true  He said there's a huge gap  And you don't even need  A huge one for a mouse  To get back through  You've been in my place  I mean you literally  Have to get through  Three doors  Just to get to my apartment  The little fella's  Going through three doors  There's gotta be  Another way into the apartment  I guess  Maybe through the back  Or there's just  A lot of mice  That's another thing  Okay  I doubt there's ever  One mouse in someone's house  Maybe he rings  All the buzzers  And then like  Whoever opens the door  He just sneaks in  Yeah  It doesn't have to be  Necessarily he's  Using your little hole  That's a smart little mouse 
[00:56:00]  Or just waits outside  For that stupid Asian guy  To deliver the food  I know what you're doing wrong  By the way  What?  You're putting him outside  What you gotta do  If you don't want the mouse  To come back  Is when you wrap him up  In a bag  You then place him  On the ground  And you do  Eight jumping jacks  On him  And you crush  His little mouse spine  Well you know the deal  I can't kill the damn thing  Cause I just can't  You feel bad?  Whatever  Yeah  You think of like  Tom and Jerry cartoons  When you have them  Exactly  I will get the mouse traps  Finally  But so  My kitchen  Is you know  Has a door on it 
[00:56:30]  Like a squeaky  Right  It gets really cold  In my little kitchen  And so you gotta close that  And it's right next  To the living room  Whatever  So every morning  Or every day  It's an adventure  When I open up  That kitchen door  I'm just wondering  Cause I've seen  What type of wildlife  This started over a year ago  With the big mouse  That I haven't seen since  Okay  And then now  It's like these little  The little mice  Well now it's mice  Alright  So Friday  After the show  I'm all happy  Like I'm mouse free  You know  And 
[00:57:00]  Open the door  And there's one on the sink  I'm like  You've got to be kidding me  This is the third one  Breezing  Just staring at you  The third one  So I'm like  Oh man  It runs under one of my pots  Ugh  That's drying  You gotta throw it away  Oh dude  You had no idea  Listen to this one  Cause I was thinking  About you  And your stupid booger couch  So it's under  It's under the pot  And before I could get there  To slam it under it  You know  Cause the pot was on 
[00:57:30]  A slight angle  Cause it's drying  It runs under one of my bowls  And as it's  One of my cereal bowls  Oh well  That's misunderstood you  For a second  How do you get in your pants  It runs under one of my bowls  Hey  It runs under one of my bowls  Run under my bowls  Ow  Wow that's a stretch  But okay  Yeah it was close  I think that's how they say  Bowls in Philly or something  So this mouse is sucking my game  It ran under my bowls 
[00:58:00]  What do you do?  So uh  So then it goes from the pot  His whisk is tickled my game bag  A lot of people wonder why  Dice hasn't been on our show yet  I don't know  I think he has all sorts of rules  Before he comes on  He's been trying to  He's been calling me  But we haven't connected  I don't know  I don't know what's going on  It's like  Just call the stupid radio show 
[00:58:30]  You know  But I guess he wants to go over things  Before he comes on  I don't know what he's getting at  But eventually  We'll get Dice back on the radio program  But  So it goes from the pot  Tree blind mice  Tree blind mice  See how they run  Under my bowls  Ow  Okay continue  It's all good  So it goes from the  My oatmeal pot  To one of my cereal bowls  You are going to have to make a trip  To the bowl and pot store 
[00:59:00]  Aren't you?  Well yeah  Because everything was drying out  Yeah  So now it's under one of my cereal bowls  And I get a boom  But I failed to mention  There was like mouse crap  All over the counter  Because now it's in a panic  Yeah so it's just crapping  And pissing all over your  All over your utensils  Because it knows it's  It knows it's being hunted  Yeah  So there's just mouse crap  All over the counter  Under the pot that it was under  For a split second  And then like a trail  From the pot  To the cereal bowl  Ugh  And so then 
[00:59:30]  And now he's under the cereal bowl  Right?  Yeah  So I'm like  I got him  I got him  This is the third mouse  I've been able to catch  So  I get a big huge  Plastic garbage bag  I  I kind of place it  Real nice  Right next to the counter  Slide the whole  Kitten caboodle  Everything  Woo  It's in the back  And I'm thinking of you  The whole time  I'm like  There goes half my kitchen  Just to get rid of another mouse  Because there's mouse crap everywhere 
[01:00:00]  Of course you gotta get rid of it  And I'm thinking about you  Like if he can't handle  One lousy booger in his couch  Booger couch  All my dishes have to go  So I can kill this mouse  The swatches are on their way  For me to pick out a new couch  Dude because I wasn't going to  Take any chances  Because it was on like  The drying rack or whatever  Yeah  So  Drying rack and everything  Oh yeah that's what I'm saying  So logically for me  I wasn't going to take any chances  Because I need the mouse  Out of my apartment  Yeah  So I just slid everything  Making all sorts of noise  Clank  And now it's all in my 
[01:00:30]  Big garbage bag  So now I'm like  You know what  Hate to say it  This one has to die  Did you hear him rustling  In the bottom of the bag  Oh no no no  Not after all the crashing  And stuff  It was scared out of its mind  So then I get another garbage bag  Well I tie that one  Nice and tight  Then I get another garbage bag  Tie that nice and tight  Then a third one  Tie that nice and tight  And just  Walked him out  And threw him in the garbage  So you think he's dead  Because of that  He can't chew out  Of a plastic bag  You think he's going to  Chew out of three plastic bags  Yes 
[01:01:00]  He can do one  He can do three  Can't chew out of three plastic bags  Not three  You really think  Going to need a bigger mouse trap  You think  Of course I think  It's a mouse  What's he going to go  Oh the jig's up  I can chew through wood  But I can't chew through  A plastic bag  He might die of starvation  Like that though  You should step on him  If you're going to kill him  Kill him humanely  That's why I won't eat lobster  I don't like the way they kill him  But you've got to kill him humanely  Just quickly step on it  These are heavy duty plastic bags 
[01:01:30]  This mouse is done right  No  No  It's coming back  He's still alive  Of course he is  Three bags and he's still alive  You better make that deal  But it was like five degrees out  So between the cold  And being in three heavy duty plastic bags  I think I finally got him  No  No  You absolutely let that mouse live  And now all weekend long  Because this is the  It's either the same mouse  Like you're saying  But if you know my apartment  I'm like  How the hell is this mouse  Getting back  Or it's three 
[01:02:00]  Different ones  And now I'm just  Now every time I open  That kitchen door  I'm just waiting for  Mother Mouse to be there  Going you know  Where the hell are my  You should have killed him  My children man  How about an exterminator  Now I'm thinking  Big mother mouse  Is going to  You know  Turn psychotic  Mother mouse  No the mouse  That you should have killed  Is going to come back  When you're old  In a wheelchair  And slit you right up the belly  After asking your name  Very good  You can't just put them in bags  And assume they're dead 
[01:02:30]  You should have whacked  The whole thing  Against the wall  A few times  Yeah I hope you're  Too nice  I mean what'd you do  I surrounded him with cheese  He'll never get out of that  My ex had a mouse problem  Which I was just praying  That they were rats  Because I just knew  That would really make her crazy  But I was over there one night  And I saw one scurrying  By like the little  Oh they hugged the walls like that  Well you were the one  That started this  When I told you  Originally when I saw  The first mouse  Last winter  You're like  Everyone that sees a mouse 
[01:03:00]  Thinks it's a mouse  It's actually a rat  You ass  I was hoping  It's always fun  To know your friend has rats  Yeah  But they're not exactly vagabonds  You know  I mean they go and pack mice  So if you got one  You got to get an exterminator  Yep  That's too easy  That's true  Have you been listening  To the show over the years  We never go for the easy way out  We're stupid  We're really just dummies  But dude they're tracking  Little mouse logs  All over your food  That's what would drive me  Logs are one thing  The urine  That's just over things  That you might not see  You've probably eaten  Out of the balls  That they're crawling on at night 
[01:03:30]  Yeah  Just pissing in  Yeah  Mouse urine  All over your  Utensils  And don't think  They don't have little things  In their fur  That jump off  Mites  Little creatures  Mites  All that stuff  They carry mites  On their back  And shake them off  On your couch  We're guaranteed  Guaranteed  Guaranteed  They've dropped  A little teeny  Mouse turd  That you didn't see  In a bowl  And then you are  Dumping mueslicks  Over it  And enjoying it  That awful cereal  That looks like  Mouse crap  I never thought 
[01:04:00]  This was raisin bran  What is that  Alright I gotta get  A bagel man  Why don't we take a break  That makes you hungry  I'm starving  Rat turd  I'm starving  Ben  When do the guests  Start arriving Ben  Whenever you want  They're here  Who's here  Well Bruce is here  And Lee's here  And Eddie's coming  You're here so early  What  I understand  I don't want to  Blow the big surprise  But I understand  We also have  Steve C  Making an appearance  Oh  Wow 
[01:04:30]  We're a national radio show  It just amazes me  Saw Steve  Coming a mile away  In the train station  The other  Yesterday  He was walking down  We just saw his little  Blonde head  Walking around  And then you know  When Jimmy's there  Because we're sitting  In the little seated  Section of Penn Station  And from across the room  I hear  Sweetie  Sweetie  And he's waving  And people just look at you  And that's the worst  Isn't it  It's just the worst thing  I ignore him  I just  And when he walks up 
[01:05:00]  I'm like  Sir please don't address  Me like that sir  So maybe people  Might not think  I'm with him  It doesn't matter  They all know  We're together  We're all sitting  Talking  Come on sweet face  Help me out  With this here darling  Hey baby doll  Can I have that  Baby doll  Yeah  I get so uncomfortable  When he does all that  I just flat out  Blow the gag  I go look  He's an idiot  He's trying to embarrass me  And he's doing  A really good job  That's good  But that's funny too  Yeah  That makes it awkward too  You have to explain it  But at least like  At least then they're like  Oh okay  I get it now  Instead of like  Sitting there like 
[01:05:30]  Oh my god  Will he just shut up  Jimmy should then at that point  Just go yeah  Play the game now  Play the game we play  Tell everybody  Play that game  Because it's not fun  Unless you do your part  You're right  My mother does that too  That's how she shuts me up  If I'm doing something embarrassing  You do that to your mother too  You embarrass your mom  Never anything rude  But to embarrass  Oh yeah  I would love doing that stuff  And she would always go  He's a comedian  He's just being funny  Yeah he's being funny  That kind of blows it  That's why he bangs hookers  It's just for the radio  I don't say that in front of my mom  I'm actually very nice  Someone wants to know  If you've tasted the local treats down here 
[01:06:00]  No  No  No I'm a good boy on the road man  I don't need to get arrested in D.C.  But on the road  You know some cities like Philly  Or Cleveland  Stuff like that  Never done it in those cities  No  No no  I have an L.A.  Which is the worst city in the country for it  I've done it in Vegas obviously  Yeah  And New York  I don't do it a lot  No  I'm a good boy  D.C.  You don't know anybody  I'm just hanging  Yeah  Alright why don't we take a break Anthony  We started with Super Bowl talk  That was just brilliant Tyson  Thank you for your analysis of the big game 
[01:06:30]  Jesus  Tyson made a good point  You said who do you think should have went  And he said I think that New England  Because they're on a roll  Back to you Ant  There you go  You know just because you've got a cat  Sorry I didn't get distracted at all  And we're going back into Norton  Crapping himself  You're in the NFL  We could have gotten better analysis from Ben  Jesus  Well you want me to go into  How do England's run into 3-4  And they're jumping into diamond defense  And you know  Running cross dog blitzes  You know  Do you want me to go into that  Yeah  What is a  Shove it up his ass 
[01:07:00]  I like it  Nice  What is a 3-4  Three defensive linemen  Four linebackers  Actually I've never known that  I always get lost in the technical side of football  And I love football  Oh  But I feel like a woman when I watch it  And they start talking technical stuff  I am a woman  Yeah the safeties drop back  Which ones are the safeties  He's going to throw it  No they're different  They're different types of 3-4s  I mean they're defense  They're 3-4s when you've got spinner linebackers  Which are dedicated rush ends  And then you've got  Ones where you bring in nickel  And dimebacks to play  In long yard situations 
[01:07:30]  At this point I'm putting the dress on  And getting the real men beer  See the 3-4  They're just a pussy  I'm not sure what the 3-4 is  My buddy is like  This guy's running the 3-4 defense  And I'm like  Is he?  And he goes  Yes  Awesome  Awesome  By the way  They're not  Awesome  This is a quickie  They're not doing the whole  I'm going to Disney World anymore  No what happened there?  I don't know  That contract's over  So whoever is the MVP of the game 
[01:08:00]  Where is it?  Brady  Brady you think?  Brady  Look they're already saying  Yeah because I didn't read anything  About the Eagles saying  They weren't doing it  I read Tom Brady  Won't be saying  Well I'm going to Disney World  Well here's the story  It's been a Super Bowl tradition  For almost two decades  At the end of the NFL championship  Someone on the winning team  Gets a shout  I'm going to Disney World  Not this year  Disney has decided  Against a promotion  For Super Bowl  Uh oh  X-X-X-I-X  39  Thank you  A company official told USA 
[01:08:30]  Today  Just say Super Bowl 39 please  Come on  I don't want to have to count  Yeah it is 39  Alright  A company official told USA Today  The promotion might return next year  A Disney spokesman in Orlando  Denied that the move was connected  With last year's wardrobe malfunction  What?  Involving singer Janet Jackson  Can we get over it?  During the Super Bowl halftime show  What Super Bowl?  You mean the big game of?  We can't say Super Bowl  Oh the big game  The big game  So  Can we forget this goddamn 
[01:09:00]  Last year's Super Bowl thing?  You know how whitewashed nothing  The halftime show  Is going to be  I had to do McCartney  Paul McCartney  How bad could it be?  Accidentally  His wife's leg falls off  Yeah when she  When she goes to make fun of a kick  And it just flies through  This  This plastic embarrassment  A long five-toed javelin  Oh my god  They got a cubit out on the news  Because it's so offensive  Yeah Disney  By the way  There's an awful book  Apparently being written about  Michael Eisner  Or whatever  A little tell-all book 
[01:09:30]  I can't wait to read it  And just  Because they're so self-righteous  With their goody-two-shoes  Family image  I love Disney  Oh I know  Good for the whole family  Little mouse  Bring the tots  Me and the girl go there  And it's a wonderful time  Everyone's so nice and friendly  Yeah but it's just annoying  Like they would black out  The Super Bowl this year  And not do it  Because of that stupid thing  Last year  Their image is so important  Yeah  And then Budweiser's not going to be able  To run an ad  Yeah what is that about  I saw it  You can see it online  You go to like Budweiser.com  Or something  And watch their spot 
[01:10:00]  It's a spot  It shows kind of backstage  For the halftime show  At this year's Super Bowl  And one of the guys  Working there  Oh no  It's supposed to be last year  Backstage last year  Super Bowl  Halftime show  And one of the guys  That's working  Opens up a Bud bottle  And uses Janet Jackson's costume  To open it up  Like uses her cup  On her bra  And rips it  And you see him  Place the cup  Back on her dress  And kind of takes  Chewing gum  And he's kind of  Trying to fudge it 
[01:10:30]  To just make it stick there  And then when he walks away  You see it kind of  Flop back down  As it's hanging  On a hanger  And then they show him  Drinking a Bud  Watching the broadcast  And you hear  Oh my god  You don't expect to see that  And the guy kind of  Looks and freaks out  That's the problem  With America  That's just funny  It's hilarious  What's our sense of humor  I mean everyone  Talked about that  After the Super Bowl  Use it now  For fun  Don't make fun of it  Because that would be  Condoning it  What happened to  Our sense of humor 
[01:11:00]  Who squashed it  Was it the Super Bowl  Was it the company  That makes liquor  That causes you  To beat your wife  And drive into families  And paralyze them  Was it that company  That all of a sudden  Has morals  No I think Budweiser  Made the commercial  Right  They obviously  Wanted it run  I think the Super Bowl  Whoever approves  The commercial  Said  No Fox  Fox  No no no no  It better not be  Fox  What I got  Human sacrifice  On facts  What I got here 
[01:11:30]  The St. Louis Brewer  Has decided not to put  The spot title  Wardrobe Malfunction  By ad agency  Blah blah blah  On a Super Bowl roster  Instead the ad  Started appearing on Monday  On the Budweiser.com website  So maybe it was calculated  So if you want to  Check out the ad for yourself  Go to Budweiser.com  That's good marketing  Right there by the way  Yeah it was probably calculated  They have this spot  That runs on the internet  Everyone goes and sees it  And they have another one  For the game  But now you know what  They would never  Not do that  Because the Super Bowl  Is such a big day  For advertising  You'll never get  The web traffic  You would get  On the Super Bowl  True  But listen to this 
[01:12:00]  What is this  Hot 97  You're raising your hand  Miss Jones  Yeah right  Our beer drinkers  Tell us we shouldn't  Overreact to the media  Scrutiny  But we had to live  In this world  Says Bob  Blah blah  Director of  Global Brand Advertising  So  The beer drinkers  What  Not one  The beer drinkers  Is there a website  Beerdrinkers.com  Beer drinkers  The beer drinkers  Basically want to see  The commercial  They want to see the spot  Yeah  Right  We have to be cognizant  That there's a line  You shouldn't cross  We have become a nation 
[01:12:30]  Of repressed  Yeah  What a bunch of  Jerkoffs we are  As a country  Babies and just  Afraid of everything  We're so fearful  That things are going  To be taken the wrong way  Don't say it  Don't laugh at it  As much as Europeans  Annoy me  They are light years  Ahead of us  When it comes to  Sexual repression  And laughing at themselves  In England  You look at the humor  They allow on TV  In England  We're all there  Then again  They have the same reaction  At a funeral too  Those cold fish  Jizz buckets  They don't cry at all  No emotion or love  A week from today  A week from today 
[01:13:00]  Around the water cooler  No one is going to be  Talking about the Super Bowl ads  This year  They're all going to stink  Yep  Yeah  Because they're also not running  The Mickey Rooney ass  Ass spot  Remember  Well thank god for that  What was that spot  He was getting in like  A steam room  And the towel fell off  His ass or something  But Fox  Definitely  I remember reading  Fox wouldn't approve  That one  Because it was offensive  Mickey Rooney's ass  Yeah  Well the problem was  I think  Is that he was  In the Bill character  And then five people  Attacked and sodomized him  Because he  I was in the steam room 
[01:13:30]  With my butt showing  And I got attacked  So alright  That's it  More repression  Just keeping  That Christian influence  We are really  We stink  Our first guest is here  So we should take a break  Get some bagels  Some food  Andy Gore's in house  Nice  We love Andy Gore  It's been a long time  A couple years  Since we've seen him  Before he appears on the show  Alright  Talking about the Super Bowl  I love this thing  It's the Green Bay  Funeral Home thing 
[01:14:00]  Oh right  When the Pats were  Playing the Packers  Back in I guess  97  Somewhere around there  Beginning of the dynasty  Yeah  But check this out  Hello  Yes ma'am  Okay  My name's Artie Milo  And my father  Recently passed away  Did your dad pass away  Did you say  Yes  Yes he did  When was that  I don't know  Two three days ago  Okay  Now he wanted to  Watch the Super Bowl  With his family  Uh huh  And we just want to know  If there's a way 
[01:14:30]  You can come over  And like you know  Temporarily  You know prop him up  In the big chair  So when the family  Comes over  He'll be okay  Until after the Super Bowl  And then we'll bury him  No we can't do that  Mr. Milo  Oh it was his one  Dream to watch the Packers  In the Super Bowl  And we already  Painted his face  Green and gold  No I  But it would  You mean  Not get him  Until then  Yeah well  You could come over  And maybe  You know  Pump him  With whatever you do  And you know 
[01:15:00]  Preserve him  Until after the bowl  No I'm afraid  We just can't  Do it  Why  It was his dream  You know  To watch the  The Packers  In the bowl  And we've been  Holding on to him  For a couple of days  Now  He's been in the barn  But you know  The coyotes  Have been a nipping  And I don't think  He's going to make it  Until Sunday  No he died  Who knows  That he has died  Hopefully  No one  But we just want you  To come over  And you know  Prop him up in the chair  And maybe open up his hand  So we can put a beer in there  And we can't  We can't do that 
[01:15:30]  We can't embalm anybody  At home  Embomb that's the word  And once they're embalmed  They can't be  You know  They can't be  In a sitting position  It just kind of  Well he's been in a sitting position  Now and he's getting  Kind of hard  But if you could  Maybe do something  And then lay him down later  No I'm afraid we can't  We'd even be up to  You know  If you've got to break something  It's okay  No we don't do that  It was his one lifetime dream  You see the pack  In the bowl  With his family  And we got the big screen TV  And the chair for him  And he went up  And up and died  We will not do that  If your dad has died 
[01:16:00]  And if you really have not  Not notified anybody  You do have to do that  So you have to have  The medical examiner's  Approval  To take him away  Okay look  What if we put  The coffin in the house  And put the TV on the coffin  That way he'll be with the family  Is there a law or something  No  If he was embalmed  And if he was  You know  Able  If there's no problem  As far as preserving him  Right  And could you put  Like a pack  Banner in his hand  Because it was his dream  To see the packs  In the bowl 
[01:16:30]  We could probably do that  You could put a pack  Well that's okay  I don't know  If we could have  A visitation  In the house  Depending on how  Well preserved he was  And if we could get  A casket into the house  But once he's  You know  Once he's embalmed  He is laying down  Right  Okay  Do you think that's  Like degrading  If we put the cheesehead hat on him  Do you want me to call  The medical examiner for you  Oh no  That might not be a good idea  Then we'd have to  Try to explain  Where his feet went  Bye  What happened to the potatoes  I have no idea

[01:19:30]  You're taking out the Opie and Anthony program 
[01:20:00]  Live from Washington, D.C.  At the XM compound, Anthony  I had to run back in here  Yeah  With food in my mouth  Me too  From eating outside  Yep  I had to run in  There's a little controversy  Going on right now  They don't want us  They don't want us eating in studio  So  So we're not  So we're not  Hold on 
[01:20:30]  Let me run out and get a mouthful  There we are  If we eat in here  The terrorists win  Yeah  It's just amazing  The priorities around here  It just amazes me  It's like  Who cares if the show  Sounds good or bad  Just make sure they don't eat  In the studio  Might get mice  In here  If we eat  Food falls down  And then before you know it  You got a mouse problem  It's like Opie's apartment  So obviously we're not  Rule breakers  So  Um 
[01:21:00]  We're not gonna eat in studio  Hell of a spread though  I tell you one thing  Ran down the hall  I'm like  Jesus  Four bagels  Woo  And a little fruit plate  It was four bagels  And a fruit plate  Hell of a spread  Now logically  Someone's gotta explain to me  How we're supposed to eat  And do a radio show  Mmhmm  See we don't really break  No  We do four hours of basic talk  With like maybe a  A segment where it's three minutes  Where we could literally  Run across the hall  Take a leak  Come back 
[01:21:30]  Throw our headphones on  And get back on the radio  Pretty much it  So if someone wants to try to  Uh  Explain to me how we could get food in us  And do a radio show  I'm willing to listen  IV  Some kind of IV  Uh  Maybe in the middle of the show  We just take a 30 minute  You know break  They could snake a tube  Down our nose  And into our stomach  And feed us that way  The food is uh  100 yards down the hall  In some kitchen area  And they're like  Hurry up and go eat  Because they don't want food  In the studio  No  How is that supposed to happen 
[01:22:00]  I have no idea  Plus you know  Eh whatever  I mean  Everyone knows I have to eat  Really early  Or I'll pass out  I will pass out  Anthony could  Anthony could survive  All day with maybe  Maybe just uh  A bagel  And a banana  That's it  Yeah  I start eating  When I get up at 4 in the morning  And just  You know continually  Oh we have to eat  Through the entire day  Yeah I just keep grazing  All morning long  And uh  I was  Under the  Understanding  Uh  Excuse me  I got a little 
[01:22:30]  Um  I  You shouldn't be eating  I know  I thought there was going to be food  As soon as we got here  And Ben's like  No the food will arrive  At 6.15  I'm like  Are you insane  You know I'll be passed out  Before then  Right  So  So we have to eat in studio  And do the radio show  I normally can't eat before the show  Because I'm in the middle of my  Jumping jacks regimen  Right  Can't you just do one jumping jack  We just want to see your form  Ben's  Look at Ben's doing jumping jacks  You can maybe lead us all  In a round of jumping jacks 
[01:23:00]  No we call them calisthenics  Calisthenics  Jack LaLanne over here  Jesus  I want to see your workout outfit  Is that  Is it that thing  With the  You know the one piece  With the thing  Yeah it looks like a 1920s bathing suit  Like it straps over my shoulders  And then goes all the way down  To mid thigh  Well leotard  Yeah leotard  It's all stripes  Finish up your exercise  With a lucky  Lucky strike cigarettes  Kind of  Grow one of those weird  Like mustaches  Handlebar mustache  Handlebar mustache 
[01:23:30]  Hey Ben can you grab a napkin  I dropped cream cheese  All over the console  Oh it's got in the little buttons too  Gotta get a Q-tip  I got cream cheese  In the controls  What do you think  We eat with our feet  Like chimps  We know how to eat bagels  Stop throwing the food  Around in there  Do you lift the weights  With the big balls  At the end  The big black barbell  500  Yeah not each one  Lift it up  Yeah they couldn't  Took a while to figure all that out  Huh 
[01:24:00]  What  Well get rid of the big  You know  Weighted balls  On the end of the thing  Make them able  Make it able  So you can  Change the weight  On the end  Instead of just having  The big balls  At the end  50 pound weights  All right  Well we gotta move on  With the program  Ben wants us to  Promote what  That we're gonna be  In New Orleans  Next Monday and Tuesday  We're gonna change our broadcast  Too by the way  On the road again  Because you can't see boobs  At 6 in the morning  On Bourbon Street  And can't drink  That hour either

[01:25:30]  How you been  Good good  And you  Very well  Good  We had a fun experience  Just getting to the XM compound  This morning  We got to see a shooting  Oh really  We don't  I guess there wasn't any  Bullets actually fired  But they were  They were in position  They were getting ready  For something  I don't know what they were answering  You know  But they had their guns out  Dogs  They were all hiding behind  Like mailboxes  And meters  And they were pointing their guns  All at one target  Maybe we'll read about it  That would be cool  If we read 
[01:26:00]  Nah  They don't report the crime  In the ghettos  No  No  Just the important stuff  That happens in the nice areas  Yeah  Is that all you hear about  If there's a crime going down  In a white neighborhood  That will be on the news  This crime crap happens  All the time in the ghettos  The ghetto  What year are you living in  In the ghetto  The ghetto  I don't know  I was listening to Elvis Presley  On the way in  In the ghetto  I live in the ghetto  All right  So Andy  What's you been up to man 
[01:26:30]  I've just been doing  The same shit  Different day  Same crap  Different day  Yeah  Just living in my little world  Making the collection grow  Any or  Oh yeah  The collection's growing  Yeah  Yeah  Some new additions  Maybe that we haven't  New additions  I've been working a lot on them  I'm working on like four websites  Oh really  Yeah  So my OCD is killing me dude  I've got like 80 things going on at once  Yeah he's got the OCD bed  Yeah  We've discussed that in the past  Really  Yeah  Do you have rituals you have to go through 
[01:27:00]  Oh yeah  It took me forever  Just to you know  Go through doorways  And redoing stuff  Really  Oh it's crazy  What do you have to do  I don't know  Like go in and out of doorways  Yeah  It has to feel right  It sounds fucking crazy  But I was like in this government study as a kid  And I like kind of pioneered this OCD drug  That you can get at like drug stores and stuff now  Really  Yeah it was crazy  Because I was  I think I was 16 
[01:27:30]  And I couldn't move from one end of the room to the other  Really  Oh yeah they stuck me in the nut ward  Holy  Dude he was fucking  It was a great experience though  I look back at their now  It's like  You know I was in  McLean Hospital in Boston  And that's where  What's that  A brilliant mind  Guy was in  Oh  A beautiful mind  Yeah yeah yeah  The professor  John Nash right  Yeah  So that was fucking crazy dude 
[01:28:00]  Jeez what did they do  They experimented on you  With drugs  Well they didn't know what the fuck to make of me  Because I wasn't like schizophrenic and psychotic  And I could handle myself  And they were just like  Yeah but why  What was the main problem that got you into the hospital  I mean you couldn't go through doorways  I washed my hands so much  It was just like two scabs  I mean it was just  Wow  I mean it was just an obsessive washing  And it got to a point where I would like put Windex in my eyes  Really  Yeah it was fucking  Why 
[01:28:30]  Windex  Why  I had to clean them  You had to clean them  Of course  And you're doing this  And you know what you're doing is absolutely insane  But it's you know it's like just compulsion to do it  You had to do it  You had to do it  And what would happen if you didn't do some of these rituals  That you had to do to get from one room to another  What would happen if you just said  Look I'm just walking through this door  I don't care  I wouldn't feel comfortable  When we all go through times where we don't feel comfortable 
[01:29:00]  I mean I'd feel I'd always be thinking of the doorway  Really  Always  It's crazy  It's an insane illness  Yeah  That is crazy  Jesus  How the hell do you function  How long does Windex burn in your eyes  Uh  It did  About 15 seconds or so  Yeah then you tear up and you cry him out  And then you see really nice and clear  Yeah  No streaks  No streaks  Wow  That is nuts  Yeah it was back in the day 
[01:29:30]  Yeah  So you're not that crazy now  But  Oh no  You still have these compulsions that make you do things  Yeah  And what is that  What kind of ritual do you have to get from one room to another  It all varies on what's going on  What day it is  Is it like a counting thing sometimes  No  No counting  No counting  Just repetitive stuff  Yeah  Stuff over and over again  So you gotta like walk in and out of the doorway a few times  Oh yeah  Yeah  No set number of times 
[01:30:00]  Just until it feels right  No  Just until it feels right  What about the door itself  Does it have to be positioned properly  I know some people that are like that  No  I mean  My OZiki is really weird  Because it's never been really pegged down  Yeah  It's kind of all over the map  But I've made my life so  I work alone  I live alone  Mm-hmm  Just so I can kind of do my own thing  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Because I'm a pain in the ass to work for  If you're kooky in your own place  And you're by yourself  Then you know  It's fine  Because you're only kooky with yourself 
[01:30:30]  Yeah  I don't care  It's like  I came out of the OCD closet  On the show  Right  Right  Right  Right  Wow  That's wild  Now I guess being alone  In your apartment or house  That gives you the opportunity  To kind of get this collection  And this hobby you have together  Yeah  I have one of the largest collections  Of freak and sideshow circus memorabilia  In North America  Yeah 
[01:31:00]  Some creepy stuff  Some very creepy stuff  And you have relationships  With some of these killers  That are in prison  Yep  As far as writing  And some that are out of prison as well  Really  Yeah  Who's out that  The vampire of Paris  His name is Nico Klaus  This guy is a  Listen to this story  I remember this guy  Go ahead  I'm sorry  No he's a  But he was a cannibal  And all kinds of crazy stuff  But they just put him in a nut  In the nut warden  He's out of the bout now 
[01:31:30]  They let him out?  Yeah  He's out now  He's doing art full time  What kind of murders  Did he commit?  He just killed  Like some gay dude  But he would work at morgues  And like steal blood  For real?  Begs of blood  Yeah  And drink them?  And drink them  Yeah  Vampire crap  How long was he in jail for?  I think about four years  Four?  Yeah four  That's good  That's all better  That's good  Yeah  I mean  That's good  One day I sat down

He was in France  Oh that's kind of safe  Yeah  Didn't he like  Cook up stuff too?  Nico?  Nah  Nico wasn't the guy  That was cooking up some 
[01:32:30]  He said raw  How'd they know  He was all better?  Like one day in therapy  They said  You know you shouldn't  Drink blood  And he went  Oh you're right  I shouldn't  I don't know  Okay let him out  He's fine  Yes  He worked it to his advantage  I have no idea  I mean  He had a website up there  Right after he got out  Called the vampire of Paris  That was really graphic  And really glorifying his crimes  And um  And that was like  Taken down  So I don't know 
[01:33:00]  If they told him  To take it down  Or if he got any  He  Wow this guy  Will do something again  That's for sure  But he's all up  For an interview  Yeah  I asked him  You know if you guys  Ever want him on  Yeah we'll talk to him  We'll talk to him  He speak English  Yeah he speaks English  Yeah  We'll see what he's all about  Yeah we love it  Yeah it'd be great  And what other parts  Of the serial killer  Like collections  Do you have  God  I have uh  Let me see  I have Charles Manson's hair  I got a bunch of  Little letters

[01:40:30]  And the statement was  I'm an ass  Creep  Yeah  There was a video made  Of him taking  A squirty bottle of ketchup  And squirt it up  Some girl's ass  And she shit it out  On the  A plate of french fries  And he would eat it  Of course he would  Yeah  It's just  He would do anything  You know  Oh jeez  Anything  Fuck dead animals  On stage  Yeah yeah  Just crazy on stage  You never knew  What you were gonna get  With Gigi  Was the music good  No  Has anyone ever reviewed  The music over the years  Yeah  Because I know  He's known for his antics 
[01:41:00]  But I mean  His antics  Yeah I mean  The last record they did  With the Murder Junkies  Was like surprisingly  Like wow  This is fucking great  And Gigi's brother  Is in the Murder Junkies  Yeah yeah  Tour now  Huh  Oh they're still around  With that one  Awful  Yeah yeah  I didn't know that  Yeah they just got back together  And I think the lead singer  Of Ante scene  Is singing  What was the name  Of that Gigi Allen documentary  I saw that  Hated it  Yeah that's a great film  To check out  Definitely catch that  Yeah  It's very interesting  My friend noticed him actually 
[01:41:30]  Merle Allen  Yeah Merle  He wanted to commit suicide  On Halloween or something  Yeah  In front of a live audience  And he couldn't get it done  In 1992 I think  He said he was gonna  Kill himself on stage  And he ended up being  You know  He was incarcerated  At the time  And then the next Halloween  He was actually supposed to  Do a show at the 930 club  Here in D.C.  And they asked me  To be the host of the show  And this is fucking great  And he ended up  Not showing up  Because his parole officer 
[01:42:00]  Said he couldn't leave  So  No Gigi  Let me ask a question  He was gonna go  Kill himself  But his parole officer  Said no  And he said  No no no  I better not  I better not  I don't wanna get in trouble  He couldn't leave the state  Yeah  There's a sincere desire  To kill yourself  I'd love to shoot myself  But I'd hate to get yelled at after  Yeah  It just sucked  How Gigi died  Over and over  It's like  Man I wanted to see  You know  Yeah he went  In a boring fashion  Yeah  But a rock star fashion  Because he kept talking  About how he was gonna  Do it in front of everybody  He just hated himself  And wanted to end it 
[01:42:30]  That's cool  When you're throwing  Your own feces  At the crowd  In front of you on stage  Yeah  You gotta really think  That over at night  When maybe you're ready  To go to sleep  When you're a kid  You dream of being  Paul McCartney  You know  Or as a comic  I'd love to one time  Just take a handful of logs  And throw them at the audience  For groaning at a mean joke  But like  When you realize  That's your whole gig  You're right  There's gotta be  Time for you later  Going you know  This is just not the way  It was meant to be  I kind of  I wanted to contribute  All my brains out on stage  And end it  There's been so many  Gigi imitators  Popping up too 
[01:43:00]  All over the place  Has there?  Yeah  But like  Gigi's the king  He's the Elvis of shit  Eating you know  The Elvis  You know  Yes he is  That's funny  That's how you plug  Those shows  He has a following  To this day  That's almost cultish  Yeah  Yeah  Especially in Europe  Well  That figures too  It's filthy people  David Hasselhoff  Yeah  I've seen him  Throw feces at the crowd too  David Hasselhoff  Yeah it's called  Every show he ever did  Stands up on his 
[01:43:30]  Nightrider car  And starts singing  You ever see clips  Of David Hasselhoff  In Europe?  No not at all  It's hysterical  Still to this day  He drives out  On stage  In a kit car  With the little  Red light  In front  Stands up on it  And sings  I'm a night rocker  Yeah  Oh my god  He's huge over there  Don't you Whitney?  Oh yeah  Of course he is  Yeah that's fucking great  You just want him  To jump off the hood  And have Kit  Just run him over  Multiple times  I'm sick of this Michael  Your songs suck 
[01:44:00]  The other thing  I want to bring up  With Andy  Is his pickled  Punk collection  Oh right  Or pickled punks  Actually  Collection  Yeah  Actually saw one of those  Yeah  Well I  When we broadcasted live  From JFK  A few years back  You know  He gave us all the invite  To go check out his pad  Which is just  Pretty disturbing  Actually  It is just packed  With all sorts of  Just crazy crap 
[01:44:30]  Some real cool stuff  Like the Kiss pinball machine  I remember  Yeah  Or something like that  And all sorts of stuff  But then he has this  Like back room area  With fish tanks  That are all kind of  Covered up  With like  Uh oh  Black velvet  With black velvet  And one by one  He  He has it all  I mean he's an OCD freak  So he has it all set up  Because he knows  He's going to show people  Right  So it starts off  Quote sort of tamed  Considering you know  It's pickled punks  Obviously  And then ends with  Just deeply disturbing stuff 
[01:45:00]  At the last tank  And slowly but surely  One after another  He lifts up the black velvet  Opie you saw stuff  That nobody's seen  These are like old  You got the uh  Yeah you gotta explain  What the pickled  How old are these  Pickled punks are  These are from the old  Side shows  They were  A pickled punk  Was a carnival term  For a freak fetus  In formaldehyde  That they would tour with  Pickled punk  And you'd pay your dollar  And you'd go see  You know  Ronnie and Donnie  The two headed baby  Right  And now 
[01:45:30]  They would name these  Oh yeah  They all had great names  What was the lion boy  Or something  The lion boy  Yvonne the waterhead girl  Oh god  Yvonne  The cyclops elephant girl  There was no name on her  Benny the big bulge baby  But it was big business  It was big business  Back in the day  Yeah  People pay to see these things  People pay to see it  And I'm sure people  Would still pay to see it too  But  Of course they would  Yeah we all like a freak show  It's very interesting  Because they're in these 
[01:46:00]  Old old jars  Some of them  And some he  He threw into the  The fish tanks  But the old jars  Have like these  Real massive  Locks and chains  And stuff  Because I guess  People would steal these things  Really  Because they  Yeah I mean  They would bring in  A lot of money  Yeah  So they would have them  Chained down  So no one could steal them  So it's really interesting  To see these old locks  And chains from  Because some of these things  Are over 100 years old  Yeah they're ancient  Yeah I mean  They toured all over the world  And they were from  Captain Harvey Boswell  He had the largest 
[01:46:30]  Pickled punk show  Touring in America  Back in the day  Really  Back in the day  So over the years  He's collected these  Damn things  Yeah  When did he die  Or is he still alive  Boswell died about  I would say  Four years ago  But he was  A carny up until  The day he died  You know  He would milk  Milk people for like  Oh I'm going to be  Selling them  You know  Send me 20 bucks  And I'll send you  A catalog  And you just pocket  The 20 you know  You ever see a  Pickled punk called  Connor  The Lil Fisherman  Oh yeah 
[01:47:00]  So  Yeah so I  I went to his pad  And saw the  Pickled punk's  Displays  And  Deeply disturbing  Especially  Was it  I'm trying to remember  Was it Siamese twins  Yeah  And the fish tank  With little diapers on  Yeah  Oh man  That's twisted  Yeah  That one almost  Made me puke  But these things  Are still pristine  And some of them  Like he was saying  Are over 100 years old  And they still  Look like they  You know  Someone threw  Oh you see  Little hairs on them 
[01:47:30]  Little fingernails  Like the Lion Boy one  I remember  Had a weird  Like mane or something  Yeah  His head started  Was like  Growing out of his back  Oh so he kind of  Looked like  Like he stood up  Like an animal  Like a lion  Yeah  Oh that is really sick  You just bend your head  All the way back  And that's how  That's how it was normally  And then the hair  Kind of looked like  It was on his back  And his head at the same time  They called him Lion Boy  But then you get to the end  That was the grand finale  The Siamese twins  In the diapers right  Yeah  Yeah  When I saw that  I'm like oh my god 
[01:48:00]  Time to go  I gotta get out of here  I was really  They put it in diapers  What happened  He gets off  You know  Seeing your reaction  When you see this stuff  Oh I  What happened with Lion Boy  They said like  Did you sleep with a girl  And he said yes  But her name was Julie  And it's been about a year  Is that what happened  With Lion Boy  Not lying  Lying  L-I-O-N  L-I-O-N  You ass  So yeah  The pickled punks  Was quite disturbing 
[01:48:30]  To see  Now wait a minute  The diapers that are on this  Oh they were being  Boswell had a show  In Canada  He was a real racist guy  And he was like  Boswell  Boswell yeah  He was like  Oh the niggers  Are fucking everything up  In America  So I'm gonna just go to Canada  And show these things off  And the Siamese twins  Had very big genitals  And they got complaints  The people who own  The camp  Or the showground  Got complaints  Got complaints  Not because there was  A fetus in a jar 
[01:49:00]  In a jar  Or a fish tank  It's because the junk  Of the fetus  In the fish tank  Was too big  Probably a bunch of Asians  All jealous that the fetus  Had better ones  Yeah  There's a lot of Asians  In Canada  So not too far fetched there  Jimmy  How long ago was this  This Boswell guy  This was in the 60s  In the 60s  Yeah  And they said  Either cover up the genitals  Or take them off display  So he put little cloth diapers  And they remain to this day  Now wait a minute  So he had to then  Open up the container  Dude  I'm going there 
[01:49:30]  I know what you're gonna say  But go ahead  And put little diapers on these  Yeah  Little cloth diapers  And put them back in the jar  Uh huh  Fill it up with formaldehyde  And seal it up again  Yeah  Our own Andy Gore  Does the exact same thing  Every once in a while  He has to clean out his fish tank  No way  He explained it to me  Wait wait  The jars  It isn't jars in a fish tank  Well there's  Well you  Well I have some in jars  Some in fish tanks  And some just floating  In the fish tank  Yeah  Yeah  Well the twins are in the fish tank  Dude  Dude it's fuck  Yeah that is 
[01:50:00]  You could curse  If you get  If you ever get the chance  I'm telling you  Because I think  We're going to be doing this  Washington  On kind of a regular basis  Once a month  Or something like that  One of these trips  Go to his apartment  You have to go  That's creepy  It's better than  Any museum you'll ever  Go to  No I can't even watch  Like commercials for the grudge  Or the ring anymore  It would freak me out  To go there  I'd have nightmares  Wait a minute  So have you touched  These things  Like skin to skin  I've never touched them  Why  What do you wear a glove  Huh  Yeah I wear gloves  But you have to lift them out  I would like 
[01:50:30]  See I've never  There's one  I call him Soupy  And he's  Why do you call him Soupy  Because he's in this  I would say  Foot and a half high jar  Yeah  With probably maybe  Three inches of formaldehyde  And he's lying on the side  And he was a frog baby  So he has like  These big bulging eyes  And he's rotted away  So his spine  Is completely exposed  And he's just lying  In like wonton soup  Oh my god  So that's  Oh my god  Damn  Can't you put more  Formaldehyde in there  Yeah  Oh my god 
[01:51:00]  Yeah  Old Soupy  Soupy  So  Did he tell awful jokes  Yeah  Let me tell you  Yeah but the punks  You know  It's like  You can't show them anymore  No  No  Very illegal  Well let me ask you a question  How long  Like what you'll do  Is you'll drain the fish tank  And then there's an exposed punk  Why wouldn't you touch them  With your hand  Is it just creepy  I've never changed one yet  Because I've just  I've just kind of  Left them as is  Because I need 
[01:51:30]  To  The formaldehyde  It's in  It's really old  Yeah  And I need to talk to  Somebody at a museum  Because how long  Would they be exposed for  Before  Like the air  If the air hits them  How long are they exposed for  Before there's a real problem  Oh god  I couldn't tell you  Okay  I couldn't tell you  Yeah  I'm not  It's funny  If the skin started to  Rot off  I'm sorry  Actually  With the freak punks  Came a crate  Of regular punks  Where they would have  These things called  Life shows  On the carnival midway 
[01:52:00]  Where  They would  You'd pay your dollar  And you'd get to see  Fetuses in all  Different stages  Of development  Right  And then for the extra  50 cents  You'd see a two headed one  So you know  Fetus-o-rama  But some  Ladies and gentlemen  Children of all ages  Exactly  I have some  That the formaldehyde  Is evaporated  And they've actually  Mummified  Really  Yeah  How many you got  You have a lot  Damn  30 something  Wow  Yeah 
[01:52:30]  It's the real deal  Does it creep you out  To sleep there  That would creep me out  I've been trying to  Convince him to get  Some pictures up  On a website  Or something  Because you've got  To see some of these  That would creep me out  To be in there  Like sleeping  Dude  He's got it all  Set up with crazy  Lighting  I remember right  Yeah  Like purple  And green  I'm trying to remember  It's been a while  But he's got it  He set it up  To just show you  You know  Show it off man  Yeah  Yeah  It's not just  Oh yeah  Look what I got  In the back  To scare the hell out of you  It's all set up  Almost like probably  How it was in the day  You know  Because with the lighting 
[01:53:00]  And stuff  You can make these things  Even freakier looking  Yeah  Oh it's great  And I  It's got so much  Of that stuff  And I really want to  Open up a museum  One day  Yeah  That's my next thing  I'm going to sell  Some stuff off  Well  What's the difference  By the way  Like it's amazing  What they judge is wrong  Like what's the difference  Between what he's got  And a museum  I mean they show  They show like  They'll show mummies  In a museum  Why is that acceptable  But what you have  Is not acceptable  What's the difference  It's all in the presentation  Yeah  You probably couldn't do  A circus sideshow  These days  Actually you can't do it  And have these things 
[01:53:30]  In there  But you could probably  Have a museum  Of circus sideshows  Right  Where you present it  Exactly  As history  As a museum  Of what used to happen  And how awful it was  And then you can show  These exact same things  Yeah  Because these aren't  Just stolen from some med school  Right  I bought off the web  These are like  You know  Legitimate carny  How old are the fetuses  Like when were these fetuses taken  Like from  I don't know  I mean  I couldn't tell you  Yeah 
[01:54:00]  Would you think it would be  But just by the jars  Like I said  And the old locks and stuff  I mean you could tell  These things  I got some that are really old  You could tell these are real old  Maybe even 1800s  No I wouldn't say that  Early 19  Early 19  Yeah  Because the gentleman  That started the Pickle Punk show  His name was Lou Defoe  And he was the one  That made it popular  Alright  Really  Really fast  Line 2  Todd from New York  If we could go to Todd  He has a question for Andy Gore  Who's in the studio here in D.C.

[01:55:00]  The skull from  It came from  A doctor's office  It's an old doctor's office  The guy died  And this kid's mother  Did a clean out  And he had the skull there  And sold it to me  For like 20 bucks  Because I thought  It was cool as hell  But my wife and kids  Don't appreciate it  Yeah  I've changed my mind  On all this stuff  I used to think  It was all cool  Remember Chuck Farnham  Chuck Farnham  Is a friend of ours  He would  Old friend  We haven't talked to him  In a while  We're going to get him  On the new show  He would somehow get 
[01:55:30]  Bones  Mail to him  Yeah  Human bones  Human bones  Called it cannibal wear  Yeah  And then he would  Make necklaces out of him  Like you see  The middle knuckle  Of like your middle finger  Yeah  Didn't you have a necklace  Yeah  I did  I buried it in my backyard  I finally got  So creeped out by it  I actually buried it  In the backyard  Of the place  I was living at  I was wearing the thing  And man  It's a conversation start  People are like  Wow that's cool  And then you tell them  What it is  And everyone's like  What is wrong with you man

[01:56:30]  Very carefully  Maybe eBay  Yeah  eBay  What was the thing  You got kicked off  eBay for  I know  But what was the  Actual item  Where they finally  Said you know what  Enough is enough  For this guy  Oh it was  The DA  Who had this  You know  Hair up his ass  To like  Make everybody moral  Yeah  Ended up getting it  All shut down  So it was just  Anything  Oh just anything  Yeah  But I have  Like all the articles

[02:06:00]  In Iraq Anthony  Oh swimmingly  Yeah  Oh ducky  Few people dead  No big deal though  Yeah they  They had a bigger  Voter turnout  Percentage wise  Than the United States  Is what they're saying  Seventy five percent  Really  On average  And some of the  Some of the places  Had a ninety five percent  Turnout  Of voters  But who knows  You know that could be  From a village  With eight people  You know  But yeah  They're saying  It went better  Than expected  There were some 
[02:06:30]  Insurgent  Killings  But  Not as bad  As they thought  Twenty nine people  Killed  Seventy one  Injured  And wow  Thank you CNN  For putting that  Right in front of my face  As we're talking about it  That never happens  But there seems to be  A problem  A couple of people  Were killed  After they left  The polling place  Because what they were doing  Was making you  Ink your finger  After you vote  So you can't vote again  If you have ink  On your finger  And apparently  They don't wash over there 
[02:07:00]  So it wouldn't  Wash off  Who was the dope  That came up  With that idea  I know  When they were trying  To do this undercover  Well it was  It was a choice  Between that  Or they were just  Going to spray paint  A red and white  Concentric circles  On your back  And have you  Walk away that way  Or dotted lines  Around your neck  Like perforated lines  What a dope  So yesterday  I guess  Four people  That were leaving  The polling places  Had ink on their fingers  And were taken  By insurgents  And killed  For voting 
[02:07:30]  Any cooperation  With the United States  Gets you killed  Over there  There was a guy  That was  I guess  Bringing food  He was a truck driver  That just brought food  Into some of the military bases  And they grabbed him  Killed him  So  Still pretty dangerous  Over there  I don't think  These elections  Are really  Really going to change that  Bush has said  Why are they all  Jumping up and down  With their rifles  By the way  Celebrating  Is that because  They're celebrating  They could vote  Probably  Yeah  Did you see that 
[02:08:00]  Didn't do much yesterday  They're all on the  Street corners  Jumping up and down  With their rifles in hand  All happy  You didn't hear about them dancing  They literally reported yesterday  That the Iraqis were dancing  Because they could vote  Because they could vote  So they were dancing  Congratulations by the way  To the liberals  You were absolutely right  They didn't want us there  They don't want  They want  They want the United States to leave  They want an Islamic state  You dummies on the left  Well the  The vote's in  I guess in  In ten days or so  They're going to count it  And see  But it's such a ridiculous  Thing  Everyone thinks  They're voting  For a president  Which they're not  They vote for a council 
[02:08:30]  The council then  Appoints a president  And I think  Two vice presidents  They keep them lined up  Because they just know  You know  Wow  We got to keep  A bank of vice presidents  Because they just know  What's going to happen  To this president  Keep one in the  On deck circle  Yeah  How funny would it be  If they elected Hussein  The people love  We love this guy  One in the bullpen  Warming up  Getting ready to come in  But it was hundreds  Hundreds  Of groups 
[02:09:00]  That you would vote for  Of these councils  That amounted to  Nineteen thousand candidates  Wow  Nineteen thousand candidates  That none of them  Were  Yeah  That are part of  These whole groups  That were in blocks  Being voted for  And I guess  They'll know  In nine days or so  Who wins  They appoint a president  Two vice presidents  And then another council  And then this one  That was voted for  Gets abolished in a year 
[02:09:30]  After they write up  A constitution  That has to be ratified  So there's still  A lot of stuff going on  Bush has said though  If they ask  For the American troops  To leave  That we will leave  So now it's up  To the Iraqis  Who are in charge  And who are  Elected in  How long we stay  If they want us to leave  The next day  Say we don't want you here  Bush has said  They will pull out  So do you think  There's a possibility  We could get out of there  Sooner than later  It would be not  I don't see it  Under a year  Because the timeline here 
[02:10:00]  Is a year  Before the actual government  That is voted on  And put in place  Is in place  And the constitution  Is written and ratified  But until then  I don't see them pulling out  We need Europe actually  We need Europeans  To help us train troops  Or to help us  Not us  The soldiers train troops  Because the problem  Is they don't have enough  Training is horrendous  The US is doing it  The south themselves  We need Europe to help  Not going to happen  No they're starting to actually  John Kerry I saw  Interview yesterday  He was actually good  He said it looks like  They're starting to come around 
[02:10:30]  Because they're all going to want  Part in the reconstruction  So they're going to have to do something  You think France and Germany  Are going to jump in this  Yeah to help train troops  I think so  I don't see it within a year  No way I see it within a year  I think so  Because the elections  Only because the elections  Went better than everybody thought  And look  Say what you want about Bush  He's been an idiot about a lot of things  But this one  The US was  All right  Kind of correct on it  Didn't go that badly  They did come out  People did come out to vote  The whole world saw  The majority of people  Came out to vote  Nine suicide bombings  Which actually  In the scheme of things  Is nothing  If you think this was the day 
[02:11:00]  The insurgents were really  Going to like  Pour it on  It's very symbolic  To blow up people  That are trying to vote  You know  So  If they could only  You know  People died  That's awful  But if you could only  Come up with nine  Suicide bombings  It's not exactly  You know  The Tet Offensive  Where we went  Oh my god  They can still put together  A real effort  As far as an attack goes here  It's nine  Suicide bombings  On a very important day  You know  They might be making  Some headway here  It's also got to be  So obvious to the rest 
[02:11:30]  Of the world  It's like  Alright here  People are being able  To vote  The US is not  Just putting somebody in  The Iraqis have  The right to vote  Go ahead vote  And they're coming out  Going if you vote  We're going to kill you  That's such a basic  Thing to tell people  That it's very hard  For anybody  In a western type  Of mentality  To accept that  That's why Europe  I think is going to  Start helping  Because it's so obvious  If you vote  We're going to kill you  I mean you can't  Just allow that to happen  And the turnout  Being so high  It's people  You know  Going against  What the insurgents  Are saying  And saying  Look we do want  To vote in  And be in charge  Of ourselves 
[02:12:00]  Over here  So yeah  We'll see what happens  In the next year  Let's see if the Times  Reports that accurately  Or let's see if  The rest of the press  Gives Bush  Any credit at all  Any  Well I obviously  And from the beginning  I really don't enjoy  Watching our soldiers  Over there  Getting these people  Their freedom  I don't think  They deserve it  Agreed  I don't think  I think  If they really  Wanted freedom  And I think  If we're ever  Going to in the future  Help a country  That wants to be free  They should be the ones  To initiate it  If they're really 
[02:12:30]  Fighting for freedom  Over tyranny  And they ask us  For help  That's one thing  If we go in there  And determine that  These people need to be free  When they haven't lifted  A finger against  An oppressive leader  In years  They don't deserve it  Freedom is something  That has to be deserved  And worked for  Before someone comes  Swooping in and helping you out  You know  And this is what I resent  The argument is  They were just  You know scared  And held  Unfortunately  That's the game  Dude it's like America  There's a lot of changes 
[02:13:00]  That need to be made  In America  But we're not rising up  We're too busy  Trying to like survive  And take care of our families  America isn't in a position  Where the population  This really needs to rise up  And take over  Right  You know  We got some unhappy people  Here over policy  But we're not at the point  Where let's rise up  And change  No I understand  But I don't see many societies  In this day and age  Like just rising up anymore  It's just  You just don't see it  Well it's the resentment  They have towards the United States  That makes me sick  Understandable  Maybe they were also  Beaten up and frightened  But this anger 
[02:13:30]  They have at our soldiers  Even the people  Who are voting  That they want us out  It's like you  You sheep  We're being slaughtered  Right  And all of a sudden  You hate the US military  Because we can't get the electricity  Well sorry  Tell your fellow citizens  To stop sabotaging  The fucking pipeline  The electricity  And everything else  We try to do  In the end  It's still going to come down  To money though  Because you're saying  That people need to ask  Or countries need to ask  For help  I mean  Taiwan's in that situation  With China  And all that kind of stuff  And they've been asking  For our help for a long time  And we're backdooring  The help a little bit  But we're still not going 
[02:14:00]  To jump on board  Because we don't want  To piss off the PRC  Oh yeah  You know what it is too  Yeah money and politics  You know  You don't  There was no real  Bad move  Going into Iraq  Politically  Aside from the way  We did it  And getting in trouble  With Germany and France  But I mean  You're not going to  Piss off some other country  That really doesn't want  You going in there  For their own interest  You know  Something like Taiwan  Yeah you don't want  To piss off China  Exactly  But Taiwan's asked  For our help  And you know  We're like  Oh okay  We'll help you just enough 
[02:14:30]  There's genocide  Going on in Africa  A few countries in Africa  And we won't go over there  Because it's not  There's really nothing  In there that interests us  But who's the first one  To call it a genocide  Colin Powell  The only one  I think in Sudan  To call it a genocide  The rest of the world  Europe  They typically  They do nothing  The UN is worthless  They just send observers  To watch what's going on  They're utterly worthless  They were worthless  With Slobodan Milosevic  They do nothing  They're ineffective  The US is the first ones  To say something  That it was a genocide  Which is a big slap 
[02:15:00]  To the face  Of that government  But we won't  You know  We tried it once  Trying to deliver them food  In Somalia  And get the food  To the people  That needed it  To help them out  But yeah  That went well  Yeah  Because the Americans  Are the evil ones  Yeah  Because we're the bad guys  And because of that  You're not going to see us  Going into Africa  Anytime to help them out  And there's  There's just people  Being hacked apart  With machetes  On a daily basis  You know  That makes Iraq  Look like Disneyland  What was happening  Over there  But it's not really 
[02:15:30]  Within our interest  To go over there  It's within our interest  To even if  A lot of people say  It's for oil  It's not oil  There is a need  For stability  In that area  Like Bush said  You know  It would be nice  To have a stable country there  But I don't see that  Happening in the near future  Even if they go  Even if they went  Balls out for a democracy  And it completely worked  And they're voting  And running themselves  They're surrounded  By savages  That it will not  Change the area  Don't you think  He also thought  All the countries  Would fall too  What like 
[02:16:00]  All of a sudden  Syria  Yeah  And  Kind of like  The whole communist thing  Where you know  All of a sudden  You get a foothold  In there  And everyone's  Going to go  Look how wonderful  Democracy is  Let's change too  And Iran  But don't you think  The Bush administration  Was thinking  You know  We'll set an example  Set an example  And everyone  The whole  The whole region  I know that's  That's crazy  But he thought  That other countries  Would follow suit  In that area  Don't you think  Probably  You know  He's a little naive  I think  In his thinking  Of how this whole thing  Is going  The whole communist thing  It was easy  You know  One country goes down 
[02:16:30]  And everyone else  Is like  Oh hey  Look what we could do  When the big guy  Goes down  Yeah  That was it  But it's a whole  Different animal  And I do mean  Animal  Over there  Those people  Are just beastly  I have  Blamey  A hatred  Of the way  They look  At the US soldiers  Too  Eventually  Look  They did free you  From this monster  And I'm tired  Of the resentment  I almost understand  It from the Sunnis  Because they're the ones  Losing out  Because Saddam was their guy  But the rest of Iraq  That just hates US soldiers  Sorry you were emasculated  By this guy  And then the US came in  And basically  Militarily  It was a very easy 
[02:17:00]  Operation to remove  That military  And hey  Sorry that you got  Your asses kicked  And we showed him  Crawling out of a hole  That's going to be  Embarrassing for a country  Yeah this is the guy  That did this to you  The one that was  Crawling out of a hole  Hiding  And meanwhile  He was living in palaces  One of the richest countries  On the face of the earth  Because of their oil  And the population  Was living in mud huts  You know  There was no sharing  The wealth under Saddam  If they actually  If things went perfectly  And a democracy  Is put in place  And the money  The potential  For money 
[02:17:30]  Is pumped out of Iraq  And given back  To the people  In the way of power plants  And water  And everything  People need  Schools  That place  Would be amazing  But that's all  The leaders over there  Yeah  I mean the same  When Arafat ran the deal  I mean they say  That he had over  Multiple billions of dollars  Stealing from the PLO  That was meant to go  To develop schools  And things like that  You know Saddam  Did the same thing  It's just ridiculous  Yeah we're evil  We're money hungry  Corrupt 
[02:18:00]  But their leaders  Keep all this wealth  Away from their people  Who just  Who struggle  Just to survive  And then their answer is  Look how the decadent American  Lives while you toil  In your mud hut  Meanwhile it's their  Leaders themselves  That are pocketing  All the money  Exactly  Amazing  Tyson Walter  Very intelligent conversation  Over there  I like actually  How he had the  Map of Iraq  With the X's and O's on it  And how he was  Sweeping around  And a pointer  It was pretty good 
[02:18:30]  He was doing his  John Madden  Put in the cross dog  Blitz  That worked well  Do a 3-4  Defense on Syria  What?  Yeah see we flank  The Republican guard  Here and we come  Through here  And then they get  A penalty for  Roughing the quarterback  When they lop off  His head and hold it up  And battle that  Awful language  They speak  Awful language  Clicks and whistles  Hey the angry  Mexican is here  Oh cool  That we met at  The Starbucks machine  We just got to say hi  The angry Mexican

[02:21:00]  They're an hour  From the beach  That is shown  On the commercial  And they're a half hour  From the lake  That they show  In the commercial  So basically  They're just raping people  Yeah a picturesque lake  Depicted in California  Pines ad  Is actually 30 miles  From the development  And California  Florida  Many of the properties  Are so far out  In the boondocks  There's no paved roads  No sewer  Water or power hookups  Yet they're still  Priced sky high  I've seen these spots  Where Eric Estrada  Gets on  You can live in  This beautiful community 
[02:21:30]  And he shows  Like all these houses  And there's a disclaimer  On the bottom  That says  Houses pictured  Not included  Not there  Homes shown  Are examples only  They are not located  In California pines  And do not represent  The actual homes  For sale of this program  You're buying a lot  They showed  Beautiful beaches  Miles away  From the property  Which is actually  In the high desert  Yeah  So you're moving  What you're buying  Is a lot  And it's presented  As this wonderful community  To raise a family 
[02:22:00]  They show houses  Schools  They show this  Picturesque suburban scene  And meanwhile  What you're getting  Is some out of  A Roadrunner cartoon  You're getting  A cactus and a rock  Is pretty much it  A sandbox  Huh?

[02:23:00]  And take a look  At your investment  Idiot  They're spending  All kinds of money  Based on Eric Estrada  Going hey  This is some great property  You jackass  You gotta go to  A professional  My guy Ricky Roma  Sold me a place  And you know  I'm buying property  From Punky Brewster  Actually  She's got a good deal  On a television commercial  I saw  Somebody stole  All the good leads though  I mean I was gonna  Get a good place  But somebody took  All the Glen Gary leads  Isn't that horrible 
[02:23:30]  Stupid Eric Estrada  And they're standing by it  They're saying  No it's fine  Some people think  They're like  The old time hucksters  Who sold Swampland  In Florida  But actually  They're careful  To stay within the law  The old story  Let the buyer beware  Exactly  They got the disclaimers  During the commercial  So that's  You know  But even though  It's in small print  Can we have  Amp doors flashing  On the screen  Is that what it's doing  They're not a good investment  And people are shocked  When they find out  The annual taxes  They have to pay

[02:35:30]  And also, Mad  The Mad Mexican  We like to call him the Angry Mexican  He's wandering around the hallways  Hey, are we going to be able to pot his show up or something?  When he gets on?  Because he goes on at 9  It would be cool to hear what he's saying  I'm just working on it  Oh, he's working on it?  Cool  That's funny  Good, we'll get to hear what he says  Hey, Tyson, you're hanging out for later on?  Maybe a couple of drinks at the bar?  What time are we getting started?  I don't know  I'm thinking we got all these  We got all these dopey meetings  Yeah, 11  A couple of Bloody Marys or something 
[02:36:00]  I think we have some stupid meetings  But later on we should all  Yeah, we'll hang out  We'll hang at that bar  Get to the little bar over there  What hotel?  Why doesn't Eric just pot up a mic over there and blurt it out?  Like we're that important  Unless he's not paying attention  If we announce the name of the hotel  Like two people will show up  It's not like the Beatles, dudes  Where they're screaming outside  Waiting for a glimpse of us  I don't know about that  It'll be one dope and his friends  A guy drove from Maryland to talk about Ben's Bulge 
[02:36:30]  I mean, that is pretty impressive  That's true  Well, we could just announce it  See what happens  It'll make for some good radio tomorrow  I don't want to  I'm going to be getting phone calls and stuff  Well, you're not registering your name anyway  I am  I was just saying that  Remember how they kind of screwed it up?  Oh, yeah  Like Jimmy said he wasn't  So I'm not going to try  Dope  I always register under my own name  Yeah  Yeah, well, because you're just hoping and wanting  No, I don't get  Please  Knock, knock, knock  Please call me  You didn't call me, Tony 
[02:37:00]  I'll tell you what  You didn't call me  Oh  One time in Vegas  I registered under another name  Because I had this weird thing with an escort  The time I was there before  I was afraid like her pimper boyfriend  Was going to come find me  It was so bizarre  I had to move rooms  All right, hold on  At the Venetian  What happened though?  Now you have to tell us  My friend went out  And hung out with this chick for free  But apparently she was a call girl  And he like banged her in a jeep  So then he gave me her number  So I'm like, yeah, I'll call her  And I'll pay her  Is the jeep the front of the back door? 
[02:37:30]  What is it?  Bang her in the jeep?  I don't know your lingo  No, the jeep was actually the vehicle  They actually went for a ride  I thought it was her ass  No, no, no, no  Put it right in her jeep  Yeah, well, it was a rump wrangler  No, he actually had sex with her  That's kind of a jeep or some weird thing  So then I call her  He gives me the number  And I'm like, yeah, my friend gave me this number  And she's like, for what?  And I'm like, you know, just to kind of hang out  Or whatever  And she's like, well, who is this?  What do you want? 
[02:38:00]  And she had my room number  So then I think  She's like, look, my boyfriend is really pissed off  That you just called  He's going to come over there and talk to you  So I'm like, is she a hooker?  Talk to you perhaps a bit more  If I may be so well  A rather naughty John  I didn't know what was going on  But I'm like, is this guy some weird pimp  Or a boyfriend?  Did Todd just bang this chick  Who has a boyfriend  Who she's not a hooker?  I mean, I could have  So I called Rob Collin  We had to move all my stuff out of the Venetian room  I was so paranoid back then  Back then? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, well now  It was real  And now if he came over  I'd just threaten to bleed on him  And that was that  So the next time I was there  I registered under the assumed name  And so I was trying to get an escort one time  And she came over  A lot of them will look at your ID  To make sure you're not law enforcement  And I took it out  And the ID name did not match with the room name  Uh-oh  So there was a problem  So that's why  Gotcha  Did she leave?  I don't think so  I think she just did the old test  To see if I was a cop  Which is you pull your mule out  They're gunning for a change in the law  That says a cop can absolutely expose himself 
[02:39:00]  Get completely naked  And uh  Do his job that way  It's not uh  Who's pushing for that?  The cops on duty?  I don't know  A hell of a recruiting tool  A cop could actually have intercourse with these girls  Get Hummers and whatever else they want  On a side note  Recruiting's up 500%  I'd leave this radio show  And how great would that be?  What are you doing?  Oh, I'm working  Get out of here  You don't call out the bus name  Until you're finished  You just have to say a certain word 
[02:39:30]  You're like  Tampa  And they run in  So you just go  Tampa  That's all over her face  Yeah, exactly  Let's get back to Andy Gore  Who's visiting us here in D.C.  Anthony  Came by to say hi  Can I quickly just point something out?  Oh yes, go ahead  We were talking a little politics earlier  A little about the Iraq situation  And we got two instant feedbacks here  That just show how the listeners are listening  Or not listening to the program  One is 
[02:40:00]  It's not about their freedom  It was always about ours  The freedom to live in a world  Where Saddam Hussein couldn't funnel weapons of mass destruction  To our very active enemies  C-911  And don't give me that bull that they don't have them  Syria, blah blah blah  Very next one down  Shut the F up  And stop with your right wing bullshit already  Take Bush's hogs out of your mouth  And get back to making us laugh  Now here's one that says  We obviously don't believe Bush  We don't believe the weapons of mass destruction  It's about giving them freedom 
[02:40:30]  Here's Bush's policy  That obviously this guy hurt us  Not agreeing with it  And being liberal douchebags  The guy  The next email down  We're sucking Bush's hog  And we're right wing idiots  It's amazing  You know why?  Because we don't have an agenda  One way or the other  Idiots  Yeah  We give both sides  We have some opinions  That are both sides of the story  Liberal and conservative  Yes  But all they hear  If you're a liberal  All you're hearing from us  Is the conservative side 
[02:41:00]  If you're a conservative  All you're hearing  Is us spouting liberal stuff  Because we're giving both sides  Our opinions aren't based on one party  Idiot  Because they're married to the agenda  They're married to the party line  Just because your agenda  And your opinions  Are married to one side or the other  And you don't think for yourself  It doesn't mean that we're the same  And that we're doing  We're liberal or conservative here  And the elections did go better than expected  And I'm saying that  And I'm saying  Look let's be honest  The press is more liberal 
[02:41:30]  Than it is conservative  I know Fox and all that  But I mean the majority of papers  The majority  Right  So I'm saying  Are they going to report this  I mean look  Because if Bush screws up  And he has screwed up  Which I said he had screwed up  Many times  They attack him fine  Are they going to give any credit  For the elections going better  That was simply  I've been watching the news  And I have heard them on the news  Saying yeah  That this bodes well for Bush  It looks like it actually worked for him  Don't say that  Bush is hogging your mouth  And you know what  The liberal media  Is the one responsible  For making this election look good 
[02:42:00]  Because they went for months  And months and months  Pounding how badly  It's going to go  And oh my god  The destruction  That's going to happen  The deaths  And this  And no one's going to  Come out and vote  So they've been pounding  That for months  And now when this happened  And it wasn't that bad  Now they look bad  Because they've been  Spouting off how evil  It's going to be  And for the douche  That wrote that in  I'll take Bush's hog  Out of my mouth  If you take  Noam Chomsky's  Out of yours  Stupid  Wow  Let's get to Andy Gore  You guys  Here we go  Andy Gore is in studio 
[02:42:30]  Hanging with us today  And he brought some stuff  We finally got to get to  The things you brought us  Well the first thing  You already handed out  Was People Magazine  With Kurt Cobain  On the cover  From April 25th 1994  And Anthony  I think you ran to the bathroom  I pulled the magazine  Right out  And I wanted to  Leaf through it  To see what was going on  In 1994  I love looking at old  Magazines and newspapers  And stuff  And Jim Norton  Absolutely  Look at him  He can't even look at me  He can't even look  He's losing his mind  Because he wants me to  Like seal this up now  So the air doesn't get to it 
[02:43:00]  So it can be saved  In pristine condition  Pristine  Well I'm a weird  Collector of stuff like that  But I don't understand  People that collect stuff  That I want to be able  To enjoy this magazine  See what's going on  I'm going to read  The articles and all that  You can go online  And do that dude  You can find those  Online  You can  But what am I saving this for  Because it's just  It's a nice piece of  That I can just  Someone else will go  Through my stuff after I die  And then they'll save it  Why is he saving  John Wayne Gacy stuff  Right  It's just because  It's something to have  That's kind of odd  That most people don't have  You know what I told Jimmy  I go 
[02:43:30]  I'm going to just  You know  Just rip the cover off  And I'm going to  Frame the cover  You could frame the whole magazine  You don't just frame the cover  You'd not  It loses all the value  Right  And you don't look at it  Without wearing gloves  The value is  That I have it  And I'm going to enjoy it  That's all  No the value is  Having the whole  Even if you don't want to sell it  You want to keep it for yourself  It's a rarer item  To have a magazine  In pristine condition  It's just a nicer thing to have  So I don't know why  You'd even  I'm going to get all freaked out  I mean it's up to you  It's yours  I don't care  Because I'm not a Cobain fan 
[02:44:00]  But I wouldn't do it  I would  Now I got greasy  Fingerprints on the cover  Yeah you're going to put  Greasy fingerprints on the cover  You've got to wear gloves  You know in the same issue  Billy Joel and Christy Brinkley  Broke up  They called it quits  It's in mint condition  Andrew's had that  For all those years  And there's something cool  About seeing a blast  From the past like that  In mint condition  It's a 10 year old magazine  So that's why I would value that  And kind of seal it up  And frame it  I got Richard Pryor magazines  And I framed the whole magazine  There's a picture of Susan Sarandon  She already looked old  Back in 1994  Look at that 
[02:44:30]  It's not like it was the 50s  Yeah but that was  You know  10, 11 years ago  She's still 50  Yeah  She's ancient  She's old  Alright Andy  What else did you  She's old  What else did you bring us  Well I got you  I had these  A worker  Hope he's going to  Clip coupons out of that  And use them  Wait hold on  Don't put that on the console  I'm going to put my coffee  On the magazine  Alright there we are  I had this girl  That works for me  That got to see  Nirvana  Right before they hit it big

[02:57:30]  But couldn't find it  Couldn't figure it out  But he knows the general area that it's in  On the side of the road  Oh that'd be  Imagine having Bernie gets his gun  That's a pretty good item  That'd be a good piece of memory  Yeah nice .38  It's over a bridge or something  Yeah he gave us landmarks and stuff  So  Kind of near a  Like a dumping ground  Yeah it used to be a dump there  So  He's probably lying  He probably has it in his living room  He just wants people going on a scavenger hunt  Loaded  Yeah that's  Waiting for another young black man  To ask him for five bucks  That lunatic  I love him  I was offered a couple of the guns

Alright cool  I'm good  Thanks a lot Mike the trucker  With dead bodies in the basement  How are you?  Welcome to the program  It was my buddy  I was working with my friend  And he came over  He had a bag of bones  He was ripping his basement up 
[03:05:00]  To put a subfloor in  And he found all these bone remains  He thought they were deer  When he come up  I looked at him  I said  We all looked at it  It was everything  It was everything but a head  What tipped you off that it wasn't  Deer remains  The watch on one of the wrists?  It's a punctual deer  He didn't know what to do  He just got married  His wife wanted to sell the house  And everything  So what did he do?  Call the cops?  No I actually took him down  It was actually in Nutley, New Jersey  He took him down 
[03:05:30]  And took him down to the police station  But he never heard anything about it  It was a couple weeks ago  Well good luck with that  That's the right thing to do  I just wanted to check in with that  See ya  No head though  Creepy  Another song?  Or is this the same song?  I don't know  Just let us know when  The Mad Mexican is talking  We gotta see what the show's all about  That first song was really good though  That was good  I was enjoying that  I'm gonna get a copy of that 
[03:06:00]  And play the old car  It's not bad  Old Saturn  Dude that's what's great about  XM Sally Radio  You can be turned on to all sorts of  Crazy stuff you would never do man  I gotta be honest  What I really listen to  Besides our channel  I listen to the Decades stuff a lot  I don't like the 40s  Because there's nothing good from the 40s  You can say our channel  Jimmy  No he can't  But Opie  You're ass deep in this show  But I  No see he says that Anthony  So he can go back to his hotel  After the show 
[03:06:30]  See  Hey look guys  It's your channel  That translates into your meetings  Are you kidding me?  I know where he's going  He's got a whole agenda  Zero responsibility  He wants it to be his channel as well  But he realizes  If he says it's our channel  Yeah he could go  Back to the hotel  After the show  And not worry about  All these crazy meetings  We're gonna do  Do you understand  Do you think that I'm dumb  And I don't understand  How good I have it  That I get to show up  At 5 to 6  And just kind of walk in  And do nothing  Well okay  Aside from Opie's channel  There's plenty of  Plenty of stuff to listen to 
[03:07:00]  That's funny  Opie's tsunami song  Yeah  That's funny  XM202  Ben Sparks  Just sitting alone in a meeting  With those dullards  We're all partying at the hotel  Anthony the Mad Mexican  We'll be talking  In exactly 4 minutes  How do you know?  You got his whole timeline?  Everything is digital around here man  They gotta figure it out  To the second  I love this place  That's nice  Those decades channels  Are phenomenal though man  I love them  Yeah  I just flip through them  My complaint is  The 80's channel 
[03:07:30]  Just doesn't play enough  You know  Songs I know  Alright  Yeah I don't  Oh no it's not  The 80's channel actually  Because the 80's channel  Will play all the pop crap  From the 80's  And there's a lot of junk  I'm talking about  Fred is the channel  That's dedicated to  Like more of a new wave  Really?  Yeah  Because the 80's channel  Doesn't play enough 80's  Like enough popular 80's  Where's the rock hits?  Can you get rock hits  In one of those?  Top tracks  Yes top tracks  Top tracks  Some classic rock hits  Anyway  Fungus is great  Yeah  You like the fungus?  It's all punk rock stuff 
[03:08:00]  Yeah right on  No he actually doesn't mean  Any stations or anything  He just really likes fungus  I love fungus  I got a jar full of it  In a fish tank  Yeah  That's great  I've been listening to  Mold and Mildew  All weekend  It's wonderful  Alright really fast  A friend of ours  Is getting a divorce  Anthony  Ah  And I don't know  You know  I don't know  I've hung with the couple  Many times  And when  I think you sent this to me  Right?  Yeah  I was just amazed  Absolutely amazed 
[03:08:30]  You didn't see it coming  Not at all  So I'm wondering  There's got to be  A really good story there  Yeah  I mean you know  During our hiatus  I went out to LA a lot  And I've been to Barry Williams  His house three times  Yep  Had the barbecue  And smoking the cigars  Drinking the martinis  Invited you to watch  The sunrise  Sunset  Which one was it?  Well that was really  Quick  I was going to say funny  And I stopped myself  But I was like  Doing some inline skating  Down on the beach there 
[03:09:00]  You know  You could go all the way  To Venice Beach  And Santa Monica Pier  Right along the water  On your skates  It's very festive Anthony  Yes I've seen it in the movies  People are biking  And running  And you could you know  Throw in some skates  And just skate along  All afternoon long  And I get a phone call  From Barry  Hey  You know  I hear you're in LA  Or whatever  I left him a message  And he's like  Yeah  I want you to come up  To the top of Beverly Hills  Like he's way up top  Overlooking all of  You know  Los Angeles and all that  He's like  Yeah come up around 5  And we'll have a cigar 
[03:09:30]  And we'll drink some martinis  And we'll watch the sun  Go down  And I'm like  Let me call Anthony  Because I always call Anthony  When I'm in these weird situations  That's what Robert Reed  Used to say  On the Brady Bunch  Let's watch the sun go down  Greg  So I'm like  Instead of saying  Yeah I'll be there  I'm like  I gotta make a phone call  So I call him 
[03:10:00]  Like from Venice Beach  I'm just kind of hanging  You know  People watching and stuff  I go  Anthony here's the deal  Barry Williams  Who's been on our show  Many times in New York  You know he always said  When you're out to LA  Give me a call  And we'll hang  And a lot of our  Quote  You can't call them  Celebrity friends  But a lot of celebrities  That have been on our show  They always say that  But then you're in LA  And you make a few phone calls  And you can't get anyone  On the phone  No they don't want to see you  No not at all  You know they're using you  For some promotion  And that's the reality  I mean that's fine  Yeah  But Barry no  He was different 
[03:10:30]  He's like  Oh my god  Yeah you're here  Cool  And you know  What I just told you  He wanted to do  So I call up Anthony  I'm like Anthony  Alright  Drive up to the top  Of Beverly Hills Mountain  Or whatever it's called  Have cigars  Steak dinner  Martinis  And  And Anthony's like  Wow that sounds great  Sounds great  I'm like do you like him  I was all excited  Is he cute  So watch the end of Survivor  Alright  Alright  So uh  So then I finally gave you  The last piece  I'm like  And he also said  Like make sure you get up there 
[03:11:00]  At like five  So we can watch the sunset  Uh  No I'm listening  Ben don't worry  It's a little odd  Huh  That's a little odd  Yeah  That's what I said  I go that's a little odd  Like he wants to  Any of these things separate  Aren't really that bad  But you put them all together  And all of a sudden  You're on a date  With Greg Brady  Right  Well that's what I'm thinking  Is like all of a sudden  We're sipping a martini  And smoking a cigar  And the sun's going down  And all of a sudden  Like he makes a move  And I have to tell Barry Williams 
[03:11:30]  And I'm like  Gay  Uh Barry  Uh  Maybe this is a bad time  To tell you  Because I just ate your food  And drank your booze  And smoked your cigars  But  I'm not gay  Because you will be  When the roofie hits you  And then I can imagine  I have to  You know  Tell him no  And then all of a sudden  The sad Brady  Bunch music  Like kicks in  Or something  But Greg  I'm not gay  Wait 
[03:12:00]  Turn that off  Nice suit  Oh he's wearing suits man  Never seen him  In anything else  On Aguila  With regional Mexican music  For the entire family  By the way  Before I forget  Want to say  Saludos  Or Northern  Para Opie and Anthony  Que me invitaron  A su programa  Hace una media hora  Y también saludos  Para Jim Norton  Un famoso stand up comedian  Que está en el programa  Con O&A  O&A están  En XM Canal 202  202  High voltage  Want to check them out 
[03:12:30]  Okay  Because if  You don't  They're going to say  Uh oh  Mad Mexican ran  All our listeners out  Opie and Anthony  And Jim Norton  O&A  XM Canal 202  That's 210  202 rather  High voltage  Want to check them out  By all means  All right  This is Raul Brindis  Spend otra noche  Sin ti  Another night  Without you  All right  Those things  Are adding up  Ain't they pal  Would have been funny 
[03:13:00]  If you said Jim Norton  And then you have  El hacko  Ben Sparks  El grande puro  El face  That's a sweet  All I heard though  Is Opie and Anthony  A lot of Spanish  He could have been  Trashing us  Yeah right  It sounded happy  Jim Norton  That could have been  And the one thing  That does weigh the program  That was Jim Norton  I love the bad Mexican 
[03:13:30]  I really do like him  We definitely like him  Gave us a nice plug there  I'm sure his demo  Is right with ours too  Okay anyway  So yeah  And then the sad  Brady Bunch music  Will come on  When I say  Greg  I'm not gay  Oh gee  So then I called him back  Yeah  Because I think you were like  Well  Trying to  Feel him out  Feel it out a little bit  We're actually having a discussion 
[03:14:00]  As to whether he should  Or shouldn't go  With Greg Brady  Because it might  Or might not be a date  Yeah because  But you know  It's freaking Greg Brady  We all grew up  Watching the Brady Bunch  Brady Bunch  Opportunity to go to his actual pad  You know  There you go  You got him  So I called back  And you know  It ends up  You know  Well my wife  Will be doing this  And my agents  Will be there  And so I was like  Okay  Dodge that bullet  Alright I'll be there at 5  To watch the sunset 
[03:14:30]  All of a sudden  Yeah right  Alright I'll go over Greg's house  Everything seems fine and dandy now  Now that I think about it  Yeah music was following him  The whole time  I was at  At his mansion  Here he comes  Coming into the room  With our wine  One of the most surreal  Moments though  You know  You pull up to his place  And you ring the  You know  He has the gate  Around his house  And all of a sudden  You ring the buzzer  And you hear Barry's voice 
[03:15:00]  Like who's there  Or whatever  And I'm like  Hey it's Opie  And he's all happy  You know  And then all of a sudden  The front door opens  And then you're thinking to yourself  Is that Greg Brady  Coming to let me  Into his house  Is like the strangest feeling ever  Hey here he comes  Yeah  Just a minute  I'll be right there  Yeah all happy  Dude running down those stairs  Does the inside of his house  Look like the Brady Bunch house  That would disappoint me  If it didn't  Did you pull up  Into that driveway  By the carport 
[03:15:30]  And walk over the AstroTurf  To the sliding glass door  And walk in  To the little dinner  Off the kitchen  Alice making your dinner  For the night  That's terrific  Stepping one of Tiger's logs  In the kitchen  And you're wiping up  With Oliver's face  See Mr. Brady  Come down in his robe  Looking all weak  And skinny  So then  I go in  And he goes  You want a tour of the place  And we're walking around  And  I don't know  All of a sudden  On the wall  There's like pictures of him 
[03:16:00]  When he was  A lot younger obviously  When he was Greg  Right  Groovy Greg  And there's like a picture  Of him surfing  And  I go wow  Where was that taken  I swear to god  Just thinking  Because it's like  Of course you know  Where it was taken  No but I'm thinking  You know  It's like any other  Like if I'm walking around  Your place  And you have some photo  Of you on vacation  And he goes  Oh that was taken in Hawaii  And I'm like  Of course it was  Hawaii  Of course  The Hawaiian episode  And I'm like  I was looking at pictures  Of the  You know  When he wasn't filming  The Hawaiian episode 
[03:16:30]  Of him just hanging  Surfing  And doing whatever  Did he have the evil tiki on  No  The bad luck tiki  No  And it was just really weird  And then in his living room  He had like every episode  Of the Brady Bunch  On VHS tapes  And it was just strange  To be able to  Really  Because it was all like  You know Brady Bunch stuff  How much  He has that on display  That's kind of creepy  Not that  That is kind of weird  No it's like  You know you have  Your films or whatever  That you like  Yeah but it's  I mean it's within  Arm's reach  He could pick out an episode  Pop it in the VCR  And show people  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah 
[03:17:00]  That is weird  That is a little weird  And then it was like  A very Brady Christmas  And all that stuff  Yeah so  But anyway  I saw nothing but happiness  In that house  Is what I'm getting at Anthony  There was another  There was another time  I went there  And you know  He told me  We're going to have  A steak dinner  And the same thing  You know it was always about  Let's have some steaks  And drink martinis  And watch the sunrise  He just  Dude he loves our radio show  I mean that's all he talks about  With you know his friends and stuff  He always had a good time  When he came in  That's for sure  He actually had a friend come by  Maybe too good of a time  Is what the problem is 
[03:17:30]  You can guess who he didn't like  On the show  I got vibes off of me  Hated my guts  He had a friend come over  That was about the same age as him  I think Barry's about 50  51  Somewhere around there  And this guy was a doctor  And swears that he didn't know  What the Brady Bunch was  When he met Barry Williams  Stop it  It's impossible  I'm like there's actually  A person out there  That has no idea  What the  You know that there was  A show on  Was it the Dickmeyer kid  From next door  No  He's a doctor now  But the guy swears  And that's why  You know he's really good  Friends with Barry 
[03:18:00]  Because he just knows  Barry is Barry  And not as this  You know celebrity  Whatever that used to be  On TV  He's lying  He is absolutely lying  There's no one  That could grow up  In this country  He said he never  Watched the show  Growing up  You didn't have to  Watch the show  It was just part of  Pop culture  You just knew  Greg Brady  Right  It was everywhere  You looked  Right  Yeah  So you know  There was another  Time I came over  And the wife  Didn't realize  I was showing up  And instead of  Having steak dinner  I watched him 
[03:18:30]  And his wife  You know whispering  And pointing at stuff  In the refrigerator  And it turned out  That's an odd thing  To see  Well because I was  There for dinner  Yeah  And you know  Usually there's like  A maid or some help  That is like  Alice  Yeah we know  She's in the center square  You know serving food  And drinks and stuff  You know but when I arrived  Obviously there's no help around  And obviously the wife  Had no idea that I was coming by  So what they were doing  At the refrigerator  Now Greg  When you have guests over 
[03:19:00]  It's always polite to  Have something available  For them to eat  I'm sorry dad  How about this hog  You want to eat that  So what they were doing  At the refrigerator  Was pointing out like  Like leftovers  That I was going to have  You're going to eat  Some Brady  Very Brady leftovers  So I had leftovers  Some kind of fettuccine  With like peas  And a cream sauce  What if they have  The people that kind of  Scrape it from their plate  Back into the container  Because they don't expect guests  I had Barry's leftovers  There Anthony  And then 
[03:19:30]  You know what I noticed  And then he had  Just really fast  Because I looked at my plate  Of food going  I hate this  And he had a nice spaghetti  With a nice  Yeah we gave you like crap  And his was a nice meat sauce  And it was just  Smelling very fresh  And mine was kind of crusty  Because it's been  In the fridge a while  How about ordering  Some takeout  Yeah  Some Chinese food  But it was just really funny  To see him and his wife  At the refrigerator  Discussing you know  I didn't expect this asshole  To come over  Look I told him to come yesterday 
[03:20:00]  We watched it  He put a scented log in  He started the fire  Alright we have to have him back  Why did you invite him over  I didn't invite him  He just shows up  You know our listeners  Are a bunch of asses  Some reason Opie goes to California  He doesn't get a hotel room  He just stays with Bob Eatman  He stays with me  Line 6  Fred in Texas  Java log with Greg Brady  Opie  No  And then line 7  Kevin in Philly  No I'm not going with the phones  I'm just quickly going over them  Line 7  Kevin in Philly  Opie called in for a Java log  Because I forgot  Java log 
[03:20:30]  I don't want him here  Every time he comes  The marshmallows disappear  I didn't know I was married  To Joaquin Phoenix  We can talk about that a little later  That's a very good segue  Anyway Anthony  The news out of Hollywood  And I'm very surprised  Because I saw just a loving couple  I really did  Yeah  I really did  I'm really surprised  When you email this to me  But Barry Williams  A very Brady split  Oh they kind of put that in there  Growing up Brady  Apparently didn't do much 
[03:21:00]  For Barry Williams  Love life Anthony  The former sitcom star  Who played Greg  In the Blended Family series  Is in the midst  Of his second marital breakup  Second  After wife Ella  Mary Matt Williams  Filed for divorce  On Tuesday  This was I guess  Last Tuesday  So the wife filed  Huh  Yeah  What did she do for a living  She had money too right  She was like  A banker or something  Like international banking  I mean like  Loaded  Like a big wig  In the financial world  Now does he have a lot of money  Because I know back in those days 
[03:21:30]  I don't think they did  The residuals  The way they started  Probably in the late 70s  Early 80s  I mean  Does he have money from that  He obviously did real well  With his career and stuff  But not like the sitcom stars  Of today  They don't get the residuals  So I heard that  She just made a boatload of money  Yeah  That's what I've heard  A big wig  Was she as big as the wig  Jan wore  In that episode  She went to the party  And tried to change her personality  By wearing the big wig  I'm the new Jan Brady  I'm the new Jan Brady  It's my imaginary boyfriend  George Glass 
[03:22:00]  The couple married since 1999  Formally separated  Earlier this month  Uh oh  Meaning  Yeah  Right around the new year  Ella Williams requested  This is where  Here's the weird part  This is where it gets a little ugly  In my opinion  Ella Williams requested  Sole custody of the pair's  Two year old son  And asked that  Barry Williams  Only be permitted to visit  With a nanny present  What does that mean  Uh oh 
[03:22:30]  Maybe they're afraid  He'll take the kid  Let's play  Let's go  What like take  And run off  It happens  Who the hell's not gonna see  Greg Brady though  Where's he gonna hide  It's Greg Brady  I'm just saying that  Because of the possible reason  I mean  Who knows  I don't wanna make any  Woody Allen-ish  Accusations  It could just be  Because  She's afraid he'll take off  Or she's being a ball buster  Well you know  I mean  Obviously something happened  Yeah  Concerning Barry obviously  Do you think that the kid  Knocked his prime rim over  Pride rim 
[03:23:00]  Oh my god  I knew what you meant  But Jesus  I really did  I thought he said  His prime rim  His pride rim  His pride rim  His nice chrome one  He put on his van  Wonderful  And he knocked it over  It went clang  Got kicked right in the ladder  Pride rim  Jim from Munaki  I suck  Pride rim  Oh  El Balbo  As they're saying  On the other channel  Right now  Jim Norton  El Balbo  El Jim Norton  The Porta de Iowa 
[03:23:30]  Que se está nevando  En Iowa ahorita  Y va al rumbo  De South Texas  Real Grand Valley  De Texas  Gonna be here  On Roberto Pulido  Later on  In the hour  For  Oh boy  He throws English in  Oi  Oi  Oi  Oi  Arriba  Arriba  Hey Holmes  Some good stuff  That's the Mad Mexican  Where  It's actually really good man  I might check that  I might sample that station 
[03:24:00]  What channel was he on again  I don't know  What was that song you were just playing  That was fantastic  Yeah  It's like a rip off of Children of the Grave though  Alright anyway  So it's a developing story  But  Yeah  She might be doing it for a little more leverage  I honestly did not see that coming  I've been to his house three times easily in LA  I've talked to both of them on the phone  A couple times  And  Even Ben and I actually ran into them at 
[03:24:30]  Oh no  Not ran into them  We had dinner with Barry and his wife  And a bunch of couples from what  Connecticut or something  Remember  Remember those asses  Remember  Hold on  Let me get your mic on  The funniest thing was  Hold on  The funniest thing is coming  Wait  Wait  Let me stand up  What happened  Hold on  Andy did you hear that  Yes I heard that  He said the funniest thing  Now this isn't just something funny  Yeah  This is  This now what we're gonna hear  Is the funniest thing  Tyson you heard that right  It's the funniest  You've seen some funny things probably 
[03:25:00]  But this will take it  This is now funnier than any of that  Because it is  As he  Let's put it  The funniest thing  Richard Pryor live in concert  Nothing  Compared to this  Stop it  Eddie Murphy delirious  Nothing  Garbage  And you brought your laughing cap right  Tyson has  It's on  Has put the laughing cap on  So we're now ready for  People I beg you  Please strap in  Pull over folks if you're driving  Because a real laugh is coming  This is Ben's amaterial  If I do say myself  The funniest thing  The funniest thing about Barry Williams 
[03:25:30]  And his wife  And having dinner in New York that time  Yes  Alright  Alright Ben  We're all prepared  We're all ready  We all have our smiles ready to go  Hope's talking about the radio show  To one of Barry's friends  From New Cane  And he's like  Why don't you guys broadcast  From another country on a boat  Remember that  That was funny  Yeah  Let's play a new game  When I'm around you  Say something stupid  I gotta punch you in the face  Wow  That was funny stuff  Terrific  That wouldn't even be funny  If Natalie Wood said it 
[03:26:00]  As she was falling off  Scott Peterson had a funnier boat story  The Modesto Follies  Another gem from Ben Sparks everyone  It's the story  Of a man named Scotty  Who was drowning two cock blockers of his own  Little fetus in one of those squares 
[03:26:30]  The Peterson  I will say this much though  Walking around with Barry Williams  Through New York  Through Midtown  That guy's so famous  Everywhere  He can't walk two feet  Without everybody  That's why that guy's  Full of crap  Saying he doesn't know  He didn't know who he was  Stop it  The guy can't walk  Without being mobbed  We went to another place to have drinks  And I'm telling you man 
[03:27:00]  They were so happy  It's going to be really interesting  When the story comes out  Because they always do  And women between the ages of like 30 and 50  Just all wanted pictures with Barry Williams  Of course  Wherever we went  Maybe she's  I heard rumor  Rumor has it  They were in the house  She was listening through a vent  And actually heard him  Propositioning a girl  And it turned out to be a goat  Yeah  And she was upset by that  Because she thought 
[03:27:30]  He was cheating  With a girl  And it turned out to be a goat  And he later asked to  Have the goat join in  That's really good  In the bedroom  Well wasn't there a time though too  That she like really really thought  That he was planning a surprise party  Yeah  And she kept running in  With her arms out  And he kept going  What do you want  You annoying whore  There's no party  And nothing  And then there was a time  She had actually  Because she's a bigwig  In the banking business  She had some important bank documents  And she asked him  To bring them to the office  And he got on his bicycle  And the tube 
[03:28:00]  He found some girl  That he knew  And left the tube  In her station wagon  And drove off  And lost the important documents  And then actually gave him  A second chance  And he lost it again  While he was looking  At magazines of hot rods  And wasn't there also a time  Like they bought for their bedroom  Some sex toys  And he couldn't put them together  Because he's not  Mechanically inclined  I believe that was his brother  Well yeah  But I know  She also complained  She didn't like him  Smoking in the house  And calling her parents  By their first name  That was true  Yeah  And his alter ego 
[03:28:30]  Johnny Bravo  Was getting to be a bit much  His singing around the house  Yeah  Alright well  I forgot about that  You guys want to know  What the Mad Mexican  Was saying about us  Oh  We have a translation  I think we have  Todd the trucker  On line 6  He wants to translate  The Mad Mexican  Hey Todd  You out there somewhere  Todd  Yeah  Yeah  Did you  Were you listening  At 9 o'clock  When he started  Off his show  St. Opie and Anthony  And Jim Norton  Yeah  Alright what did he say  He said Jim Norton

We're not even going to get Elo on our program  What a poor excuse that is  We stink  What's he doing?  A national radio show  Broadcasting live from Washington D.C.  From the XM compound  And so far we've been able to get  The Mad Mexican on our program 
[03:38:30]  And Andy Gore  Andy Gore was great today  But that's it  That's it  Andy or Tyson are old friends  Tyson, yeah  They're buddies  They're guys we know  We had to bring Tyson from New York  To get him on our program  So  We actually told Andy  He was going to be on Friday  But it just took him a whole weekend  To walk out the door  And finally shut up  Very funny  What else is going on?  Well I would like to discuss  A movie I saw last night 
[03:39:00]  In the room  Okay  I saw a movie  At that fine hotel  That we're not naming  Because we're all scared  That there's going to be  That's right  Just thousands of fans  Outside the hotel  Hoping for a glimpse  Of you and I  And Norton  I'll have to hang a baby  Out the window  And then molest it  Pull him back in  Like a little bowling ball  That is the worst  Well you don't want to  Park those big red curtains  And hang a baby  Out the window do you?  They are just big red curtains  They certainly are 
[03:39:30]  Anyway  Go ahead  Yeah so I watched  A movie in the room  And it was pretty good  The only down part of it  Is I kind of knew the ending  But the movie  On the whole  I kind of enjoyed it  I actually liked it  And I think  If I didn't know the ending  I would have thought  It was a very  Very good movie  I would have been like  Wow  That really cool movie  You saw Million Dollar Baby?  Nope  Didn't see that one  I know I gave away  The ending to that movie 
[03:40:00]  You absolutely didn't  Give away the ending  To that movie  I did?  No  Why?  You absolutely didn't  Give away the ending  Why?  You were so vague  I have no clue  What you're talking about  And by the time  The end of the movie  Gets there  It would be over  So  You really didn't  Give it away  Because I felt bad  That I gave away  The ending of that movie  That's up for an Oscar  I have no idea  What the ending of that movie  Is based on what you said  Alright  What's wrong?  This is  I'm not trying to  This is annoying me so much  I want to spit in somebody's face 
[03:40:30]  What is it?  This way they're talking  Tossing Delgado under the bus  Is annoying me so much  Oh Rick  Well hold on  Because what Anthony has to say  Is really good  But  No no finish what you're  No no no  Dude this is what the show's about  It's a clusterf  We don't mind  So go with it  What happened?  I mean we kind of know  What happened  But Rick Delgado  Is our old producer  When we were doing  The WNEW thing  And we told you  That eventually our names  Would be thrown into  This whole tsunami song mess  That we've been kind of  Following along on our program  Right Am?  Yes  And you know 
[03:41:00]  They still haven't fired  The morning show  At Hot 97  I'm starting to think  That they're going to  You know  Attempt to ride this out  And I think they're going to  Throw good old Rick Delgado  Under the bus  And say hey  It was all Rick  All Rick our producer  And you know  We'll fire him  And everything will be okay  With the world  And then they'll bring back  The advertisers  And everyone will be happy  They were upset  With the shooting Asians line  And that wasn't Rick  You know  They were upset  With the way that  Miss Info  Was being yelled at 
[03:41:30]  And mocked  For not wanting to participate  In the tsunami song  And that was Miss Jones  That said that  I don't see how anyone  Can skate on this  By throwing one of them  Under a bus  Like Rick  This is the letter  I'm an informed insider  I feel compelled  To tell what is actually  Going on  Well this is a letter  That's being sent  All over the internet  By the way  Yes  On hiphop.com  Or whatever it is  Miss Jones and Todd Lynn  Had nothing to do  With the writing or production 
[03:42:00]  Of the tsunami song  The song was written  And produced by Rick Delgado  Who was the producer  And supervisor  Of the morning show  Everyone involved  In the production  Participated under duress  Because we all know  Being on radio  When the producer says  You better sing  We all sing  Under duress  What type of duress  How is Rick  Going to force people  To sing these songs  What does he say  Sing  I'm going to rub  My Bob's big boy hairdo  On you  These assholes  That's not  That would never be  The call of the producer 
[03:42:30]  Of course not  You know  We have a bunch of people  That send in stuff to us  And help produce the show  And then it's up to  Anthony and I  And sometimes maybe  Even management  If we're wondering  To decide if this is  Something we should  Put on our show  Could you imagine  Ben forcing us  To do anything  No  Ben no  I just want you  Shut up  Beat it  Alright  Beat it  So they're saying  Under duress  These people participated  In the production  Of this song  Yeah  And it gets better  Miss Jones is not  The singing voice  The song was voiced 
[03:43:00]  By Rick Delgado  DJ Envy  And the production  Assistant Tasha Hightower  Who initially  Objected to performing  The song  But were coerced  By the producer  To participate  In the project  This is actually  What happened  The truth is  Todd Lynn  May have made a mistake  In his shooting  Agent statement  But he  Nor Miss Jones  Had anything to do  With the written  Production  The tsunami song  Nor are they racist  Your energies  Are being seriously  Misdirected at the wrong  People  If you really want  To combat racism  Go to the root  Of the problem  Miss Jones and Todd 
[03:43:30]  Are on air personalities  They do not control  What is played  Over the airwaves  Yeah because  Opie and Anthony  Have nothing to do  With what goes out  Over the airwaves  It's all Ben  We want to say something  Ben says no  Everybody here  Just goes  Alright Ben  It's your call  This is a producer  Call  I.e. Rick Delgado  Who was also  The producer  Of the Opie and Anthony  Radio show  Which was taken off  The air for similar  Antics  These scumbags  At MS  Are trying to ruin  Rick's career  By saying that  He's the only one  Who did it  And they're trying  To figure  Hey Opie and Anthony  Are bad guys  Let's rope O&A  In with this 
[03:44:00]  Tie it into them  And try to  Focus it on you  These fucking snakes  Yep  And I'm not knocking  Todd or Miss Jones  This is the management  The upper management  This is not the on air people  I am writing this  Because I can no longer  Sit back and watch  As two people  Who made a judgment error  Be touted as racists  And called the tsunami too  Please forward this email  To everyone you know  Did they call them that?  No one heard that  At the very end  It's just that  They  Please be proactive  In looking for the truth  And not reacting  In condemning  The two radio personalities  The producer did it 
[03:44:30]  Rick Delgado  Let it be known  So you notice  The one person  This scumbag  Wants to accuse of racism  Is not black  That's who he wants  To accuse of racism  Is of course  Probably because you know  Rick is Spanish  But you know  We have tape of  What's her name?  Miss Jones  Basically yelling and screaming  At the Asian broad  Miss Info  Because she wasn't  Supporting the song  As she was playing it  Isn't that like  Someone writing a letter  Saying well  Opie and Anthony  Aren't the ones  That had sex in a church  So they shouldn't be fired 
[03:45:00]  Right  It's like you know  I would have loved that  But it's a pretty thin defense  Dude there's a massive  Hip hop battle  That has taken place  In New York City  So I think  MS Broadcasting  Is going to try to  Save this radio show  Because they're getting  Such exposure  For the morning show  That if they can  Ride this out  They will have a chance  Against  Star and Buck Wild  What?  Star and Buck Wild  Buck Wild  No I really  I'm serious  You know  Because they came back  To New York radio  And everyone's like  Oh my god  They're just going to  Clean up  And this is their shot 
[03:45:30]  Hot 97  To stay in the game  If they could  Save this show  So now I'm thinking  They're going to  Throw Rick under the bus  Like you're saying  And then say  See we took care  Of the problem  And now they could  Live off all the  Exposure and publicity  They got for the  Tsunami song  And I think they  Should save the show  I don't think Todd  Should be fired  Or Miss Jones  Or Rick  You want to go  With management  Look let's be honest  The program director  Is way over Rick  And if he didn't want  To play it four days  In a row  It never would  Rick cannot override  The program director  And play what he  Wants to play  Rick doesn't make 
[03:46:00]  The on air personalities  Do anything  This just handed to me  We just made the  Daily News in New York  Who done it  There's been some  Debate over which  Members of Hot 97's  Miss Jones morning show  Are heard on the  Parody Tsunami song  That got most of the  Team indefinitely  Suspended  Critics who say  It really doesn't  Matter which specific  Voices are heard  Which I agree with  Right Ant  Yeah  I held a rally  Outside Hot 97  Friday to demand  The dismissal of the  Team  The song's ethnic  Slurs and jokes  About tsunami victims  Have also led several  Advertisers to  Temporarily pull their 
[03:46:30]  Spots  The station said  Friday that while  The team has  Suspended their  Salaries will all  Be donated to  Tsunami relief  Efforts  They're going to  Try to save the  Show  Miss Jones has  Apologized for my  Poor decision to  Go along with  Playing the song  Ah  Going along  She was more than  Just going along  She was just  Railing on anyone  That didn't agree  With her decision  To play the song  On her show  Of course  Suggesting she  Wasn't involved in  Its creation and  Several sources 
[03:47:00]  Inside Hot 97  Says she and  Fellow team member  Todd Lynn were  Not  The song was  Written they say  By morning show  Producer Rick Delgado  Who used to  Produce Opie and  Anthony on  WNEW  The three voices  On the parody  They say are  Delgado, DJ Envy  And a female  Production assistant  Who reportedly was  At first reluctant  To participate  We hear Todd's  Voice on the  Damn thing  I don't know  If it's Todd's  Voices or not  It might be the  DJ Envy  I'm not going to  Say it's Todd's  Because I really  Don't know  But it just  Annoyed me  That they're  Throwing three  People under  Like that  And it sickens 
[03:47:30]  Me that they're  Using Rick to  Link to you  Guys to try to  Get the dumb  Public to go  Oh he was part  Of Opie and  Anthony  He's the problem  He must be  The bad guy  That's upper  Management at  MS  That's not Todd  Miss Jones  That's upper  Management  Typically insincere  Jerkoffs trying to  Save the show  Have some balls  Put the show back  On and say  Look it was in  Poor taste  You want to  Fire the program  Director that's  One thing  But don't make  It look like  Rick forced this  Because he didn't  He couldn't  If Rick walked  In the Opie and  Said hey guys  You're playing  This and you  Guys said no  No no  What are you  Going to do  The producer  Gets yelled at  By the on air 
[03:48:00]  Tower  Without a doubt  They have no  Power when it  Comes down to it  The producer  Gets yelled at  Hey dude where  The fuck is that  Stuff we asked  For  Alright sorry  I'll get it  For you  That's the way  It works  The producer's  Job is to  Throw as much  Material in front  Of Anthony and I  And then we  Filter through  And go you  Know what  We don't like  That it's hacky  Or this is  Oh wow that's  Pretty cool  We'll play that  That's it  That's it  Because that  Really really  Makes me sick  Well we said  Our names would  Be dragged into  We just knew  Of course  We just knew  That would happen  Textbook 
[03:48:30]  Textbook exactly  Well Anthony  We might have to  Save your movie  Thing for tomorrow  I'm thinking  Oh god I can't  What movie was it  I'm sorry I  Jumped on it  I really can't  Well because we  Have Elo outside  The studio  He wants to  Say hi  Lee Abrams  I mean he  He wore his  Open Anthony  T-shirt to work  Today  Yeah  He's so proud  Of us  I mean he's  Got to at least  Come in and  Say hi  Alright  I'll wait  Hi Jimmy  Hi Eric  How are you  Why don't you  Kiss him  Do not kiss me  Man  Why Eric's  The affectionate  Guy  He just kissed

[03:53:00]  It's a direct rip off  Of Inside the Act  With you know  60 or 70s  Ultra fans  We get off the website  So they're like  Really into it  And it's really intimate  It's uncensored  And really  Anything goes  It's not the stupid  You know  Radio interview  Where it's all fluffy  We really  You know  Dig in  And you know  Every one of these  Has it's own life  I mean  Brian Wilson  That whole experience  Of having come in here  That was unbelievable  In a very strange way 
[03:53:30]  And then you know  You've got the Phil Collins  Types of nice guys  And he really gets  Into the history of Genesis  And tells great stories  About what Robert Plant  Is really like  And just  All this amazing stuff  Anyone in tomorrow?
