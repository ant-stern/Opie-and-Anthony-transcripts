<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Larry King's surprising introduction, immediately followed by the hosts’ typical banter, this time focused on E-Rock's tardiness.  A jarring iPhone alarm now signals his arrival, much to his continued chagrin.  The show then launched into a discussion about why Fonzie from *Happy Days* never actually fought anyone, despite his tough-guy persona.  This segment was repeatedly interrupted by E-Rock’s alarm.

A significant portion detailed a tense meeting with their boss, Scott Greenstein.  The hosts meticulously recounted the awkward handshake Opie refused, Greenstein's unusually tight pants, and the overall uncomfortable atmosphere.  They debated whether various actions constituted "belittling,"  eventually concluding the interaction was uncomfortable but civil.  They also discussed Greenstein's equally awkward attempts at post-meeting small talk.

The conversation shifted to a man climbing a light pole in Times Square, eliciting cynical commentary and dark humor from the hosts about the police overreaction.  This segued into a lengthy discussion about Tracy Morgan's controversial jokes about the mentally disabled and the resulting outrage. Opie and Anthony engaged in extended and often offensive commentary, criticizing the perceived oversensitivity of advocacy groups and their strategies.  Caller Joel shared his personal experience with a brother who has cerebral palsy, offering a counterpoint to their discussion.  The hosts also dissected jokes made by another comedian, and a song about retardation was played during this segment.  Further criticism of guest host Rob Cross's performance concluded this section.

The show continued with a contrast between the "Funtown"/"Funville" atmosphere of their studio and the "Yawn City"/"Dullsville" mood of the surrounding offices.  Jimmy demonstrated this contrast by physically walking between the two areas, altering his demeanor accordingly.  Rob Cross's poor performance as a fill-in host was heavily criticized, with audio clips illustrating his awkwardness and lack of preparation.  The hosts detailed the fill-in host selection process, including a spinning wheel, noting E-Rock's unenthusiastic participation.  Further discussion focused on upper management personalities and habits.  Opie’s unpleasant experiences in Times Square, including encounters with aggressive street vendors (Elmo and an Elvis impersonator), were recounted at length,  with the hosts railing against Times Square’s tourist traps and scams.  They extensively discussed the definition and examples of "rubes" they encountered.  A brief discussion about a woman’s indecent exposure while doing yoga in Central Park and an anecdote about Glenn Beck being harassed in Bryant Park followed.


A caller then described a family outing marred by a negative encounter with other park-goers, using highly offensive racial slurs. Opie and Anthony responded with similarly offensive language, discussing diversity and tolerance while veering into unrelated tangents and jokes.  The caller’s graphic descriptions and emotional reactions were interspersed with the hosts’ offensive commentary.  The conversation included discussions of Glenn Beck, Justin Bieber, and the Casey Anthony trial.  Audio clips from the caller, analysis of Jason Alexander's tweets, and comparisons to the "The Virus" comedic bit were included.  The hosts also shared their opinions on Hulk Hogan and Linda Hogan's divorce, and a segment revisiting Eric’s “What the F” rants concluded this portion.

The show later featured Anthony’s boastful disregard for air travel dangers, laced with irreverent religious references. This led to a discussion about satellite radio technical difficulties and their interactions with a service representative, Gary Ledbetter, whose unusual sign-off ("do-do-loop") became a recurring joke. A substantial segment focused on Sandy King’s appearance on *America's Got Talent*, performing "I Love Nick," and her subsequent social media activity. Audio and video clips were played, generating further ribbing from the hosts.  Their numerous unsuccessful attempts to interact with Dr. Michio Kaku, their neighbor, were recounted, often highlighting Kaku's apparent discomfort.  A phone conversation with Dr. Kaku finally occurred, blending serious discussion of a wildfire near a Los Alamos nuclear facility with the hosts’ jokes and personal anecdotes about Kaku's social awkwardness. Jim Norton joined near the end of this interview.  The show concluded with the "Flock of Burt's" comedic audio sketch and a mention of an upcoming Raw Dog podcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, this is Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  What the hell am I doing here?  Isn't it brilliant?  Forget it. The thing's out of control. Out of control.  Great guests, interesting interviews, and of course, your phone calls as well.  It gets my nipples hard. You know what I mean, son?  Are you out of your mind?  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to a show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to answer it.  Oh, you're going to have a ball. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, you're good.  America's most trusted name in news, the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Let's welcome our hosts, Opie and Anthony.  By the way, who's Jim Norton?  And then we have Rage Against the Machine really low in the background.  Yeah.  Well, turn that shit up.  Someone might still be sleepy.  You're still sleepy, you rock.  Oh, it's up.  You can't hear it? 
[00:01:00]  It's all right.  It's kind of low in the mix.  Let's turn my headphones off.  Bugger.  Anthony wanted to know if you're still sleepy.  No, I'm fine.  Still sleeping now?  You good?  You good?  What time did you get here?  I think it was like 545.  All right.  I can't.  We have to.  I know.  We started the E-Rock alarm today.  E-Rock.  And the people that were in on the bit are laughing their asses off. 
[00:01:30]  It's the E-Rock warning system.  Yeah.  And other people are like, what the fuck is going on?  E-Rock, did you know we started the alarm today?  No, I did not.  Why are you so low in the mix?  Yeah, you're low in the mix.  What did you do?  I'm not doing anything that's any different than every morning.  Oh, what are you eating?  The other day, we got on E-Rock's case because, you know, he likes to push it as far as his 
[00:02:00]  start time here.  Yeah.  So we said, you know what?  We need the obnoxious iPhone alarm, and we're going to play it every time E-Rock arrives.  You didn't know this happened today?  Nope.  So in the middle of whatever's going on on this channel, when you walk in, that alarm  sounds.  So the world knows when you arrive to work.  We're hoping this might change your habits because nothing else has worked. 
[00:02:30]  What do you think?  All right, we'll give it a shot.  No, we already gave it a shot.  It started today.  We got the audio.  Okay.  So the replay was playing, and this is how it went down.  We have to ask you one thing.  Yeah.  Why didn't Fonzie ever beat anyone up?  We have talked about this on our show off and on for years.  Everyone was scared of Fonzie, but we're like, he never beat anyone up. 
[00:03:00]  I'll tell you why.  Because power comes from inside.  Nowhere.  You don't need to hit somebody.  You don't need to make fun of somebody.  You can just be, and with that, intimidate.  So there you have it.  That's how it went down before 6 o'clock.  And it was 548, by the way.  That's great.  It was 548.  548.  Yes.  That's 48 after the hour.  That's closer to 550 than it is 545. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  548.  If you're rounding up.  So now you guys know.  When you hear the alarm, it's going to fuck up the replay and everything.  We couldn't get the Fonzie answer because E-Rock arrived at that very moment.  Yeah.  So it fucked up the answer to the fight question.  That's actually the submarine dive, dive, dive.  Yes.  What do you think of that, E-Rock?  That's just great.  Do you like that bit, Sam?  I love it.  Oh, Sam can't get enough of it. 
[00:04:00]  I think it has potential.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish we didn't explain it today because people were very confused, but now we're not  going to explain it anymore for a while.  Yeah, now more people know, but believe me, there'll be plenty of people that'll be like,  what the hell was that?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just looking forward to the day that it interrupts the live show.  Yes, by all means.  Because there are days when that happens, too.  Oh, that's great.  Why not is right. 
[00:04:30]  Yesterday's after show.  Good choice.  Did you like it?  Yeah.  What are we doing all this week?  Guest hosts?  Well, yeah, I guess we're spinning the wheel this week.  Spinning the wheel and having other people host the hour?  Yeah.  Between us and Ron and Fez?  Yeah.  Well, well.  And who was yesterday?  Well, the wheel landed on Rob Cross yesterday.  Oh, it did.  Rob Cross is one of the cute bosses.  And I don't mean cute in that way. 
[00:05:00]  Very funny, not ha-ha funny.  You know, just, it's adorable that they walk around and go like, hey, I'm the boss.  And you're like, aw, look at him.  It's like when you go into the store with your mommy when you're a kid and you go to buy something  and mommy gives you the money and goes, now pay for it.  Remember that?  Yeah.  And then you go up to the register and go, here, mister.  And he gives you the change.  And you're like, look, it's adorable.  He thinks he's actually making a transaction.  Like a person.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, like a real live person. 
[00:05:30]  You're responsible.  He isn't that cute.  Yeah.  The store owner looks at the mom or dad and goes like, aw, shakes his head.  Like, aw, that's adorable.  That's how we feel when they try to do something.  Well, that level of the bosses.  We had the meeting with the real boss yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Sam just puts up crying babies on the screen for us to look at.  This leads to Rob Cross, but we have to update the people on the meeting.  It was terrific.  Oh, that's right.  Our meeting yesterday.  I started getting the googly eyes about five minutes before the end of the meeting. 
[00:06:00]  I started getting those eyes that go all over the place.  Oh, really?  Because I'm so ready to just fall asleep.  It's very hard to stay awake in those meetings.  You should have just stared at his ball bag and his tight pants.  That would have kept you awake.  Who's that?  Does he have?  Oh, my God.  I guess it's fashionable, but our boss, Scott Greenstein, loves really tight fucking pants.  Oh, really? 
[00:06:30]  Dude, he had a ball bag camel toe as he's trying to talk to us about shit.  Was it distracting?  It was distracting, yes.  Does it look like he's packing?  A ball bag?  Come on, is he packing this or if he is?  His balls were split right down the middle.  Ow.  By the seam.  Maybe they're fighting.  I don't know.  What the fuck, man?  I didn't notice that.  Obviously, the pants are tailored to be extremely tight.  I guess is that in? 
[00:07:00]  Tight around the groin.  Is that in for management to have really tight fucking slacks?  I guess so.  It's kind of probably like a power thing.  Yeah.  Like, hey, look at the size of my balls, huh?  Don't fuck with me.  Well, the meeting started with an attempted handshake.  Oh, boy.  That made everyone uncomfortable.  Oh, boy.  And by the way, that was grounds for me to not even sit down, according to yesterday.  It was the attempted handshake, which Opie had to address by actually saying, I'm not shaking 
[00:07:30]  your hand.  God.  Yeah, yeah.  And I was just sitting on the couch, like, with my head down.  Were you uncomfortable?  Oh, God.  Did you get embarrassed?  God, was it uncomfortable.  I said.  Wow.  I officially said, I'm not shaking your hand until I feel like I have a fair deal.  Because he hung himself.  He hung Scott out to dry with it.  Because Scott put his hand out to shake his hand.  And he goes, I'm not shaking your hand.  And then Scott kept his hand out for a little bit. 
[00:08:00]  And he's like, oh, God, why?  What's going on?  And then he slowly pulled his hand back and walked to his chair.  And I was just like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  What am I going to do?  Oh.  He understands.  Well, he seemed to have.  Yeah, because he didn't, like, lose his mind.  Well, let's go through the checklist, I think.  Okay.  Raised voice.  There was no raised voice.  And I didn't raise my voice.  No.  It was very civil.  I kept it very professional.  Very civil. 
[00:08:30]  A meeting of the minds yesterday.  There was a touch of belittling, of which Opie addressed it in a split second.  And actually said, you're belittling me.  And grabbed his blueberries and phone as if he was ready to just leave.  He did.  And then he turned to me with his maniacal eyes.  He turned to me and went, he goes, that's a leaving offense. 
[00:09:00]  Like, you remembered all the little things that were written down and there was some belittling.  No, but I asked you for a ruling.  Yeah, yeah.  Because if it was officially a belittling, I would have left.  I looked at you and I said, that's a leaving offense.  Was that a belittling?  Yeah.  And you sort of said, sort of.  It was starting as a belittling.  Belittling, but he stopped at the second Opie acknowledged that, like, look, you're not  bullshitting me.  I know this is a belittling.  Then we got the handshake. 
[00:09:30]  We know how that ended.  No, no handshake.  The mic's in Times Square, not even brought up.  No, that was spun.  Although, it was spun.  It was spun into, I don't understand, he says, I don't understand why you guys wouldn't want  to broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe and do a live radio show.  I'm like, that, look.  That was that being spun because he's heard a million times.  Hold on, Opie.  Yes.  Let me play the devil's advocate.  Sure.  Is the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square? 
[00:10:00]  Yes, that's what I'm saying.  Would we be broadcasting through microphones?  Yes.  All right.  You have the problem there.  I should have walked.  No.  No.  Yeah.  It's mics in Times Square, but it is switched around a little bit, right?  Well, he goes, I don't understand why you wouldn't do that.  And I look at it, and I go, this was never brought up.  Of course we broadcast live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  It was presented walking around Times Square with mics.  Right.  Oh, request to stop complaining. 
[00:10:30]  I thought he would bring that up.  Now, there wasn't a request to stop complaining, but there was a comment about our complaining.  A little joke, if you will, right from the beginning.  Mm-hmm.  And it was like, uh-oh, am I, uh...  Oh, no, he goes, I gotta make this quick.  Yeah, I guess I gotta make this quick.  I heard you guys on the radio, which is a belittling, by the way.  Which was, it went from request to stop complaining to a belittling. 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  And that's what Ovi brought up, you know, belittling.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Then, uh...  Well, you had this off at the pass, so he didn't even have a chance to get this in.  The statement, you guys are in a great position.  Because Ovi automatically walked in, and I believe one of the first things out of your mouth was, you gave us a shit deal.  And that's what this is all about.  So, it was hard for him to then come out with, hey, you guys are in a great position, because he'd already prefaced it with the shit deal. 
[00:11:30]  I did say that.  I did say that to him.  Yeah, yeah.  But going back to request to stop complaining, I think that's finally out of their vocabulary.  I think it is.  Because you got the golden child making a ridiculous amount of money suing the company.  So what can we possibly say that hurts the company more than the main guy suing the company?  Not a thing.  Do you think that's something they talk about behind the scenes, the suit?  What?  The lawsuit.  Oh, my God, yeah.  They must talk about that constantly. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Just constantly.  So that was good.  I was actually sitting on the couch hard against one of the arms of the couch, and I had my backpack in my lap, and I was hunched over it, hugging it, with the same feeling I got when Dad's spaghetti hit the wall.  No.  That is kind of how I was.  You were way better.  In a strange way, I think you were enjoying it this time around.  Oh, I was enjoying it.  I think this time around you were enjoying it.  I always throw the good cop thing in there. 
[00:12:30]  But at this position, I was pretty much just an observer, but I laughed at quite a few things.  I was chuckling.  I go, that's belittling, isn't it?  That's belittling.  And you're like, eh.  I think that's belittling.  I should leave.  I thought these rules were just for the air.  No, no.  It was a checklist.  That I remembered.  I remember the whole checklist.  Oh, you remember the checklist.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then as we got up to leave, after things were discussed, again, no handshake. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, no, no.  Not even any eye contact.  It was like, meeting's over?  All right.  Oh, because he just walks out the door.  Well, you're missing one point.  He goes, how's your kid?  I looked at him like, and he goes, oh, okay, okay, all right.  The small talk.  See, he went in for some post-meeting small talk.  After everything, he asked about my kid, and I looked at him like, we don't have to do this.  It was like a Seinfeld thing. 
[00:13:30]  We don't have to do this.  We're not on that level.  And he looked at me and went, oh, okay, okay.  It was like a silent thing that we both did.  He understood that, you know, maybe someday he could ask about my kid, and I would care  that he's asking about my kid.  Someday.  I'm standing there in his office.  I hope he walks.  He's already halfway down the fucking hall, getting out of yawn city.  Getting out of yawn city limits.  Well, I'm not that brave.  When I walked in, I walked to that one seat knowing there's coffee tables and all sorts 
[00:14:00]  of shit in the way, which makes it hard for him to shake my hand.  He surprised me because he was right at the door, so I had to hold strong and say, I'm  not shaking your hand.  And then on the way out, it's easy to go through the coffee tables and stuff, and there's  no way he gets around.  Before he gets around, your back is to him, and you're already walking down the hall.  What happened after I left?  Jesus Christ, he grabbed my hand like a fucking predator when Dylan and Schwarzenegger shook  hands.  Dylan!  I need to shake something.  Please, just shake my hand. 
[00:14:30]  So, yeah, I shook my hand.  I was like, all right, take it easy.  Nice to, you know, working on some stuff.  You know, I did the old...  I told Ed, I feel better that I was able to at least voice my concerns.  I know damn well nothing's going to change anytime soon.  Maybe a couple tiny little things.  Brought up the guy's raises.  I don't even know if he heard us say that, but...  Yeah, and then a couple other things got brought up, and yeah, whatever, you know. 
[00:15:00]  And surprisingly, my bad mood was on a very low level after the meeting.  Yeah.  And officially went away at 4.46.  I thought I was going to go away at 5.  4.46.  In the middle of a bike ride at 4.46, I went, wow.  I actually said to myself, I got to mark this.  I'm not in a bad mood anymore.  You kind of feel all right.  Yes.  You kind of feel all right.  And then I tweeted to have a record of it.  4.46 was the official time.  If you had that in the pool there, you win. 
[00:15:30]  Wasn't it two-day funk?  Man.  Oh.  Man, it was good to just tell him how I feel about him in this place.  And, you know, and I told him I have deep concerns as far as my future goes here.  Yeah.  And we'll see what happens.  Well, that was the gist of it.  It's like, hey, you know, where are we going?  Yeah, I mean, I love doing radio with you guys and stuff, but...  It's fun.  I don't want to sit...  We told him we don't want to feel like we're just sitting here stagnant.  Not moving forward. 
[00:16:00]  If we sit and, you know, the agent and them and everybody hashing stuff out and then...  They come back with something that, again, leaves us in the exact same position we're  in right now, that is a non-doer.  That's completely unacceptable.  That is, yeah.  And, yeah, unfortunately, that'll be...  Yeah, that'll change things drastically.  Yes, very drastically.  Whatever, but it was all right. 
[00:16:30]  No, it wasn't...  I thought it was.  I have no hope that things will change anytime soon, because I don't want to be tricky  anymore.  And then we walked outside and took pictures with the smelliest man.  Oh, God damn it.  Dude, his fucking...  And that's my fault.  Wow.  I was there.  That guy stunk.  Did he stink?  Underarm odor or breath?  It was that B.O.  It was horrible.  That full-body B.O.  They didn't ask for our autograph. 
[00:17:00]  I forced myself into the situation as a joke.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All these guys are hanging outside with folders and pictures and stuff, and I'm like, guys,  we had a long day.  We don't want to sign anything today.  Knowing that they weren't there for us.  They're like, what?  And it's like, you know, no cameras.  And the guy goes, I don't even have a camera.  And then another guy goes, I got a camera.  And he's like, all right.  And I'm fucking taking pictures.  It was hilarious.  We had to talk the guy into believing that we're really famous.  Into taking a picture. 
[00:17:30]  Because he didn't know who the fuck we were.  And he smelled so bad.  And then he went to put his arm around me, and not even like on the back, like a hand  on the back, or even on the waist or anything.  He went around and grabbed my arm, like he was pulling, totally pulling me in.  And I turned to him, and as the picture's snapping, I'm going, get your hands off me.  Because he smelled.  That means his sweaty pit was on your body somewhere.  At least if he had one hand on your back, sort of, you could have got away with it.  Yeah, no, it was horrible. 
[00:18:00]  And then we saw, like, the hostage negotiations going down.  Yeah, there was a big hostage negotiation team driving down Broadway.  And this is, we're desensitized in New York, because none of us cared.  I was just like, oh, wow, what are you doing?  Like, oh, I want to go home.  What are you doing today?  Small talk, and we left.  Yeah, turned out to be some asshole in Broadway.  Oh, yeah, I saw the hostage truck.  I'm like, what is that?  Yeah, but we didn't even care.  Yeah, by the time we were in Kenny's truck, we weren't even talking about it anymore.  It was a hostage negotiation team rushing to Times Square, and we're like, eh, let's go home. 
[00:18:30]  Because they had a chit-chat.  I guess they thought he was going to jump or something.  I think they thought they had a jumper.  Well, it's the big story today here in New York.  The guy climbed a, what, a light pole?  There's a big light pole here in New York, which tend to be pretty high up, you know?  And he's just wrapping up there?  He was pulling an attention whore thing.  Right.  Fucker.  If I had to drive through that traffic, oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:19:00]  I could think of a few ways to get him off that pole lickety split.  Sure.  Sure.  Just shoot at his feet, right?  Might as well.  And make him dance a little bit.  Yeah, make him dance.  Dance, motherfucker, dance!  So, is he a crazy person?  Yeah, what's the story?  Sometimes these things aren't crazy people.  A rapper?  Sometimes it's well-calculated.  Some Brooklyn rapper, yeah.  Is he a real rapper?  Is he one of those rappers that hand out their discs in Times Square and make the Rubes pay for it?  He's done different publicity stuff. 
[00:19:30]  He's disrupted a BET shooting, a Today Show shooting.  Oh, great.  Oh, really?  He's wild.  To get himself attention.  He wanted to meet Alicia Keys, who was performing on 44th.  Oh, really?  She was doing some outdoor thing for whatever it was.  So, he's got to be kind of crazy.  Yeah, he's just like one of those guys who will do anything to get his face in the paper.  He seems annoying but harmless.  I don't know if he has done anything actually threatening or just this stuff.  You're like, what an asshole.  Yeah.  Well, it tied up Times Square. 
[00:20:00]  That's the cops that overreacted.  Um, they blocked 20 blocks around.  You think?  Yeah.  How many blocks?  20 square blocks around.  Some crazy amount because they tasered that one guy on a ledge and he fell to his death.  And it's like, fuck him.  He should have been tasered.  This guy should have been tasered.  You lay down a mat and taser him.  Fuck him.  We had that almost car bombing in Times Square.  That's about a year ago or so, right?  Yeah.  So, now they're not taking any chances.  They don't take chances.  So, when this shit goes down, they're freezing the area. 
[00:20:30]  They'll be overly cautious because they know if he dies, everyone's watching.  Yep.  The cops couldn't just knock him off because there's 5,000 people watching.  The old days would have been great.  They'd just throw in their nightsticks at his face.  Whatever.  Now, you got a sensitivity.  This is what happened when you get sensitivity.  All that business loses money.  They should have got a fucking fire truck with a cherry picker.  Yeah.  Within 10 minutes, that truck should have been there.  They should have laid down a mat.  You can't knock the guy off in case he's crazy.  Then you fucking get the cherry picker.  Then you yank him off.  You lost me with the cherry picker.  You get a fire truck and you hose him down. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, that'd be great.  Is he the right color?  Knock him right off.  Oh, God.  Is he the right color?  I don't know if he's Spanish or...  Oh, God.  Is he the right color?  Might be Spanish.  Did I just do a Tracy Morgan there?  Oh, boy.  You better apologize.  Please tell me he's not black.  He's not black.  I'm in trouble again.  Apparently, I'm in trouble again.  This time with the retards.  I hate that we're proven right all the fucking time.  It gets boring as shit to be right all the time.  The retards are after him now.  Oh, of course.  Now he did something.  This would happen.  We said this would happen. 
[00:21:30]  So the mentally disabled groups said that it was way too far, and they are demanding  a Tracy Morgan apology.  And we said this would happen.  Can't you just take the last one and take our homos and put it retards?  Just do that.  I know film people.  I work on films.  They could take me, put me in a blue screen, and just hand me with anybody.  Maybe I upset the Puerto Ricans.  And they are strong like chimps. 
[00:22:00]  They're strong.  Retarded guys are strong.  I'm sorry.  They're fucking powerful.  When he said they're strong like, when retarded boys grow up, they get strong like chimps.  I've never seen a weak one.  That's hilarious.  I'm sorry.  I find that very funny as a comic saying, as Tracy Morgan saying it.  This isn't a fucking meeting of let's hate mentally disabled people.  It's a comedian.  Well, there's two things that happened here that we said would happen. 
[00:22:30]  Tracy should have just said, I apologize, and that was it.  He should have never done all that shit that Glad wanted him to do.  Because now he shows weakness, and now the other group has come forward and go, well,  guess what, Tracy?  Now we're going to hold you hostage.  He can't do his act now.  Right.  And the second thing is, that's why you have to push back against all this, because we  said that every group's going to want their taste now.  Every group.  You've seen Tracy.  You know what he does.  He gets up there, and just everyone can be goofed on.  And now they're just going to be looking at him under a microscope for him to say one 
[00:23:00]  fucking thing, and then another group's going to pop out.  We'll see what happens with this.  Tracy Morgan offends with jokes about the mentally disabled.  Tracy Morgan stuck his foot in his mouth again.  Did he?  They wrote it like that, too.  I'm not over-reading.  But it's amazing.  No, he didn't stick.  He was just doing his act.  He was doing his act.  Again.  He was just doing his act.  And then he went on to tell a story, though, by the way.  He told a story that went with it.  It's like, these fucking groups just suck. 
[00:23:30]  All of them.  They take one little piece they don't like, and that's it.  Only weeks after profusely apologizing to the LGBT community, that was Tracy's fault,  by the way.  He shouldn't have gone that far with the apologies.  For his homophobic rant at a stand-up performance in Nashville, he managed to offend another group  of people, the mentally disabled.  Retarded people.  Can we say they're retarded?  I know.  The mentally disabled.  Mentally disabled.  Because when you say that, you're pointing out that they're different than us, right? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, of course.  They're retarded.  Don't ever mess with women who have retarded kids.  Morgan, 42, said Saturday at the Carolines.  As groans of, uh-oh, were heard in the crowd, he continued,  them young retarded males are strong.  They're strong.  They're strong like chimps.  They're strong like chimps.  And he didn't even say them retards.  Like, he said those retarded males, retarded, he didn't say those retards.  If he did, it's fine.  But, uh, once again, this fucking group, these fucking, these leech groups find a guy, a performer, 
[00:24:30]  and they piggyback the performer to bullhorn their message.  Fuck all of them.  Well, Tracy made the mistake of becoming a spokesperson for GLAAD.  Yes.  It's pretty much what he did.  They had him for two weeks as their official spokesperson.  Right.  You know what that would have cost?  If he would have even said yes, which you wouldn't have.  But if they approached him and said,  Tracy, we'd like you to be a spokesperson for GLAAD.  Oh, my God, yeah.  You better hand over some of that homo money. 
[00:25:00]  I ain't saying a word without some green.  And now, uh, uh, with the, the retarded people, uh, and it's not even the retarded people.  It's, you know, their parents.  Right.  In the group.  The retarded people just go like, yeah, that's funny.  Mm-hmm.  They don't care.  Yeah, I am strong like a chimp, motherfucker.  Yeah, you want to kick your ass.  You want to test me?  My dick is five feet long.  Exactly.  Big dick.  And they are strong.  They don't say Rhodes Scholar strength.  Yes.  It's called retard strength because everybody knows growing up, the retarded kid was strong. 
[00:25:30]  Very strong.  Very powerful.  Uh, people would fuck with them and they would take it.  Yeah.  And then when they snapped, when the retarded kid snapped.  Wow.  And fucking goon-handed you, you were finished.  Yeah, yeah.  And then no one fucked with him again.  Run.  Run for your life.  And everyone knew that that kid was strong and would fucking put you through a wall if  you got angry.  What makes, what makes them so strong, you think?  Their ligaments?  They're 40.  I, they're 40.  I think it's their ligaments. 
[00:26:00]  I think.  I think they got really, really strong ligaments.  Now, I have no science to back this up.  Yes, Jimmy.  So please.  Sure.  Don't, don't, don't hold me accountable.  But I would think that there are some, some, um, genetic anomalies that comes with, uh,  down syndrome.  You know, uh, facial features, certain things, ears.  There are things that are just naturally occurring with that, um, uh, chromosome problem.  And I think muscles, muscular makeup and muscle mass is part of that. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  We're getting fired today.  Uh, yeah.  Wow.  No, no.  I thought I was crazy.  I think that, I think that, I don't know, I have no facts to back it up, but why wouldn't  there be some kind of, um, genetic anomaly, uh, that, that would also do that?  Or maybe it's the fact that because of, uh, uh, limited, um, uh, brain power, because it 
[00:27:00]  is, it is that, that there is a weird, um, thing with a fight or flight where there is  really no fight or flight.  It's just all fight.  I don't know.  I'm just, I'm just, it's an open dialogue here.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I'm not saying this for the record.  My theory is, yeah, they, um, might, because of their retardation, yes, lack self-control. 
[00:27:30]  So self-control.  So they windmill, windmill and they eat a little more and bigger guys are harder to fight.  Oh, well, that could be, that could be, I mean, there are, there are guys out there that  have never been to the gym and will beat the shit out of you because they're bigger guys.  Could it just be magic?  I think it's magic.  You could work your, you could work your ass off in a gym, but if a 220 pound guy that's  never been to the gym with a fucking beer belly comes at you, you're in deep trouble. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, you are.  Right?  What was that article?  I thought I said something that said retard strength, no myth.  Was that, uh, an article or was that?  Oh, no myth.  It was an editorial.  An editorial.  Why doesn't Mythbusters take this one on?  They really should.  Why not?  You know what?  Mythbusters should.  Can you imagine that?  When you said, uh, there are people who have never been to the gym a day in their life,  but they'll beat the shit out of you.  I looked over into E-Rock's room and he goes, yeah, that's right.  You better look over here.  Oh, shit. 
[00:28:30]  Like he'll beat the shit out of you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Do you think E-Rock could beat the shit out of you?  I think in the same.  Absolutely.  I think in a physical confrontation, E-Rock could handle me.  Absolutely.  Readily to handle you.  If you can catch me.  448, uh, 548 for E-Rock today?  That's tough.  That's right.  You want to start a little chart on the list?  That's right.  That's right.  Well, Tracy, uh, he did this to himself in a way.  Yeah.  He gave him a little too much power.  A little too much juice. 
[00:29:00]  I'm just worried about all the comics out there, but they're going to have to deal with  shit now.  30 Rock star went on to tell a story about an alleged teenage romance he shared with a girl  he described as a cripple with a prosthetic arm, a mechanical, uh, larynx, larynx, larynx,  one of those things, and a portable dialysis machine.  Wow.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  She was a cripple.  She must've gave great head.  She had my daughter.  Earlier in the night, Morgan said something went through his mind that I can't share with 
[00:29:30]  you all.  When the audience encouraged him to spill, he said, I can't.  I just got out of controversy, man.  This is diabolical.  This is diabolical.  Uh, I love you all so much, you said.  Did I tell you that tonight?  I've been in trouble lately, and this was big for me that y'all came out.  Yeah.  So the group that we all know about now, and this is why these groups are doing this.  Yeah.  Is, uh, ARC.  ARC.  A non-profit advocacy group serving people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. 
[00:30:00]  Already demanding an apology.  Tracy Morgan should apologize immediately.  Bradley CEO Peter Burns told E!  News.  See, it's already on E!  News.  E!  News.  It's over.  This quote is far too offensive to be excused as comedy.  Go fuck yourself.  Enough.  We all have to push back.  Enough.  Yeah.  This quote is far too offensive to be excused as comedy.  No, it's offensive to you.  But it's not even offensive.  It's just another guy.  It's offensive to this guy, and maybe it isn't. 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  To be considered comedy.  And as obvious as...  Don't tell me what comedy is, asshole.  That is, in that fucking statement right there, is how everybody excuses how this fucking,  this pussy country wants apologies for everything.  It's irritating.  Right.  And then when people are genuinely sorry, like, I think Tracy really felt bad about  what he said about gays.  And instead of just going up and saying, hey, look, I'm really sorry.  I shouldn't have said that.  And then moving on.  And then going, look, I said I was sorry.  I meant it.  That's the end of it.  Right.  It's not enough.  It's not enough. 
[00:31:00]  They want to put you to work.  Fuck all of them.  Yeah.  Now, they want Tracy Morgan, you know, in their camp for a while.  That bothers me, though.  This quote is far too offensive to be excused as comedy.  You can't tell people what comedy is.  You can never do that.  There's people out there that like really, really dark shit.  Yeah.  Even darker than some of the stuff we say on our show.  That's what they consider comedy.  Other people want it light and fluffy.  Yes.  Yeah.  But don't then think that your definition of comedy should be the definition of comedy. 
[00:31:30]  It's arrogance.  And it's a spoiled country.  It's intellectual being spoiled.  So, because we're taught that nobody wins and nobody loses and you can't say, there's  no judgments.  They all feel entitled to not have their fucking feelings hurt.  Right.  Everything's out of whack.  It's like, okay, it is wrong to beat the shit out of a kid in school.  But they think that that translates into the fact that you can never make fun of somebody  because they're not funny people. 
[00:32:00]  No one funny is saying this shit.  Right.  No.  It's all unfunny fucking people.  And the ones that are funny that have said it are people who are fucking worried about  their own shit getting taken away.  It's enraging.  He should say, I don't find that funny, but, you know, other people do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Too bad.  No one defends anybody's right to say things they don't like.  Right.  But we're cunts.  The whole country.  We're all cunts.  Nobody says, I don't like it, but go ahead and say it.  It's not my business.  And once again, it was in a fucking comedy.  Of course.  But the people that say that, that do say that, they don't get any attention. 
[00:32:30]  None.  It's not like they're a group.  You've got to be a group and you've got to have sensitivity and get together and yell  because somebody said something that offended you.  It just sucks.  Hey, let me get to the end of this.  Joel, don't go anywhere.  His brother has cerebral palsy.  Oh, how about that?  Well, I don't want to talk to him.  And his brother has massive strength and he'll tell you why.  Oh, really?  Oh.  So, yeah, told E! News, this quote, and it's very hurtful to people with intellectual and 
[00:33:00]  developmental disabilities and their families.  Might be hurtful to their families, but not to people in general.  Sorry.  Yeah.  It's not my...  You know what?  I get offended every day.  Hurtful to the people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  No, but maybe their families.  No, their families.  I'm hurt by that, sure.  And that's life in the big city.  That's life in the big city.  No matter what people make fun of, unless you're talking about just handbags or completely  banal fucking observations about things that every human experiences, somebody may get 
[00:33:30]  offended by that.  There's no way around it.  Even if you're saying nice things, like you believe in gay marriage and you believe that  gay people should be happy.  Well, there are religious people in this country that think gay people should be burned alive.  So you are offending those people.  Yeah.  Oh, I guess your opinion is more valid than theirs.  Ouch.  This is hot.  That's why there's all these flames.  That makes sure.  But everyone thinks that their fucking opinion is the right one and their values shouldn't 
[00:34:00]  be offended.  It's like you keep saying it and it just, it doesn't change.  Yeah.  People are fucking hateable.  And ready for this last line?  Mr. Morgan has an incredibly powerful platform from which to fix this, from which to fix this.  And if he's learned anything in the last few weeks, he can't bomb this apology.  What does that mean, bomb the apology?  That means he's going to have to do the tour.  He's going to have to go all in with this one, too. 
[00:34:30]  Can't just throw it away with a little quick little, I'm sorry I said that.  Yeah.  Thank God their advocacy groups are retarded.  And they've been after comedian Tracy Chapman.  They're retarded.  Tracy Chapman's a singer.  So there you go.  We told you this would happen and once again we're right.  Once again we're right.  Every group is feeling the power right now.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  They were just waiting for their next celebrity endorsement.  Yep.  Just waiting for the next celebrity endorsement.  Yep.  So we got gay, we got retarded out of the way.  What's the next one you think?  Blacks have recovered in the last couple of years.  I think everybody's a little fed up with black groups at this point.  That will change.  But their pendulum has swung a little bit because...  The other way.  Yeah.  So they've been kind of fucking...  They're even starting to mention black in a couple of the articles.  As crazy as that is.  I'm going to go Asian.  You know what?  Let's throw it on the table. 
[00:35:30]  Latin groups haven't fucking had anything to bitch about in a while.  I don't know.  Those Hispanics, man.  You guys don't get offended really, do you?  You're not really a complaining people.  Other than...  No, I'm not even making a joke.  I know.  I don't think they're offended as easily as other groups.  Immigration shit bothers them.  Like, the Jersey guys doing that thing about illegal immigration really bothered...  Anything with to do with immigration or status in the country, that's their fucking hot button.  But it seems like Hispanics could roll with the punches, huh? 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, we don't get bothered too much.  And you're right, Jimmy.  It's immigration shit that really bothers us, calling us wetbacks and things like that.  Or calling each other wetbacks or you don't belong here.  But what bothers me, I understand not liking that, but when they question the legitimate immigration violations...  I want to play stupid today.  Why does the term wetbacks bother you?  I'm talking about method acting.  Why does that term bother you?  Because that's what happened.  It bothers me because we don't swim to get here. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, is that what it comes down to?  Oh, literal Mars.  So who had to swim to get here?  No one did.  The Haitians.  When people, you know, the refugees, they come up, like Cubans, for example, boat people and things like that.  You know, you've got to cross rivers to get over here illegally.  Right.  And not, you know, be formally introduced into the country.  So you look down at the people that had to swim here?  No.  And the ones that just kind of sneak across the border?  No, we don't look down on them.  They just, there's a little conflict there when you guys call us wetbacks and just group us in together with the rest of the other. 
[00:37:00]  So you look down at the wetbacks.  So if you're called a wetback, it pisses you off.  Well, it's different.  Instead of that, we look down on them.  We're not like that.  We don't have to sneak into the country.  No, meaning you look down at them.  No, we don't.  Every group looks down at people is what I'm getting at.  That is true.  Absolutely.  You're absolutely right.  All right.  Now you explained that.  But we're pretty good.  Yeah.  We take jokes pretty good.  We're joking people.  We have a lot of fun.  We touch too. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Do you joke about your memories and how they stop at one period?  Yes.  All your memories, the wall.  Oh.  I forgot about this guy.  Yes.  Joel with the brother.  Joel, go ahead, buddy.  Yeah.  My brother has cerebral palsy.  And what the deal is, they've got extra...  By the way, Joel, that's how you should start every conversation on the phone.  It's a great icebreaker.  Oh, my brother's got cerebral palsy.  Shut my dick.  Cerebral palsy is a motherfucker, huh?  Well, it's worse because as he gets older, it's degenerative. 
[00:38:00]  So it breaks down.  So, like, he's got partial blindness now.  Jesus.  He doesn't walk so hot.  So...  But anyway, as a youngster, man, dude had massive upper body strength.  And he had a short fuse.  So one of these kids on the playground was kind of fucking around with him a little bit.  And he gave him some shit.  And finally, dude just hauled off and just clotheslined the fucker.  And it went down like a sack of potatoes.  I mean, down.  And that's right, man.  Nobody fucked with him. 
[00:38:30]  But you guys remember L.A. Law?  Benny from L.A. Law?  That was a strong motherfucker.  Right.  That was TV.  And that's definitely true to these guys that are slow that are fucking strong.  Special Olympics.  Something about Mary.  Wasn't he strong in something about Mary?  Warren?  They've always stereotyped it that way.  And they are.  In movies and stuff.  Yeah.  But look at the Special Olympics, man.  Those fuckers can haul out and ball.  And walk on a crooked, but they can ball.  And there's certainly truth.  But no one ever talks about it. 
[00:39:00]  But honestly, as someone who's related to someone who is retarded, disabled, whatever,  I'm not offended because it's a broad statement.  Had they named my brother personally and said, yeah, man, that guy mocked up in Detroit, man.  He's a fucking slow motherfucker.  I'd say, all right, you crossed the line because you called him out personally.  And I think that's where people need to get off, you know, the pulpit and say, look, it's a broad statement.  When you make it personal and you individualize people that are not celebrities, it's being fucked up. 
[00:39:30]  So that's why I think you crossed the line.  Didn't you have something on white blood cells, too?  Oh, yeah.  Massive white blood cells.  I mean, guys are never sick.  Never, ever, ever sick.  No sniffles.  No colds.  Nothing.  Because it's the extra white blood cells.  And also, it slows the white blood cells going up to the brain.  It keeps it all in the blood.  Now, the tissues and the ligaments and the muscle still slows down as he gets older. 
[00:40:00]  But dude's healthy as a fucking horse.  I mean, it's just unbelievable.  Slowed out a little bit.  Yeah.  Exactly.  God just bundled that up differently.  Yeah.  He's been giving you a lifetime of colds.  He said, ah, I'm going to give it all to you up front.  Yeah, no shit, man.  No shit.  Nah, I don't even want to joke about that.  That sounds like hell on earth for the poor kid.  Well, I mean, you know, he's got the biggest heart in the world.  But it was especially tough on parents.  They divorced because of the whole fucking deal.  Because my dad's like, ah.  You know, so I mean, you know, it's tough. 
[00:40:30]  But at the same time, you've got to take it lighthearted.  And you can't get, you know, all tied up like these fucking support groups are saying,  oh, fuck Tracy Morgan.  You know what?  Who gives a fuck?  You know, it's funny.  Go see his act.  You know, support comedians.  I mean, I support the local funny bone here.  I go out there three, four times a year.  Sorry, Mr. Norton.  And it's a good fucking time.  But you cannot get all caught up and get hung up on every single fucking joke like these  gay and lesbian groups and the retard groups. 
[00:41:00]  Because it's not fucking cool.  All right, Joel.  Well, thank you for sharing with us today.  Thanks a lot, Joel, for bringing your story to the table.  We're wiser because of your phone call.  Yes, we really are that much of the wiser.  Thanks a lot, Joel, for opening the window into your home.  You really have opened our eyes today, sir.  Thanks for bringing us into your kitchen for a few minutes to watch that food get thrown  on the floor.  Bye, Joel.  All right, Joel.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:41:30]  You want to know the theory on retard strength?  Yes.  Yeah.  By the way, I'm telling you right now, we're not apologizing for shit.  Not at all.  No, there's no reason.  This is stuff that people talk about and wonder about.  Exactly.  Stop it.  You ever say to a smart guy, hey, hand me that piano.  It's always the retarded guy.  They're stronger.  Sorry.  Yes.  Sorry.  Some of them might not be, but the ones that I went to school with always had a lot of  pubic hair.  They had big dicks, and they were strong.  Sorry.  And if you don't agree with it, feel free to call up and educate us. 
[00:42:00]  E-Rock, are you thinking Special Olympics or Special Ed today?  I need to know ahead of time.  Well, we have that plus Drew Boogie's Retard Cheer remix.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You should probably do that and something else.  Okay.  Jeff, what do you got, buddy?  Oh, yeah.  Anthony said earlier that he said it's fight or flight, and they don't have the response  for flight, so they just fight.  Like Anthony, I have no scientific backing or anything to back this up, or theory, or 
[00:42:30]  Reddit, anywhere.  All right.  We got it.  But I think it's because, as a normal person, we're raised, and we know that, hey, if you  hit another person, you always hold back subconsciously when you fight someone.  They don't have that.  They can't hold it back subconsciously that you're really going to hurt this person if  you give it your all.  Okay.  Yeah, because even when you're in a confrontation and you are fighting, you're still kind of  holding back.  You know what I mean?  You realize, well, if I fuck this dude up in a way, I could be in a lot of trouble. 
[00:43:00]  So then you adjust when you're fighting, even.  Yeah, that's true.  You always keep that in your mind that you don't want to fucking be in prison, stomping  on his head.  Because when you're fighting, if you didn't have that filter, wouldn't you try to just  break his neck and be done with it?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  So instead, you're wrestling and punching, and maybe you try to break his nose or something.  Yeah.  I like his theory, in a way.  Except for me, I'm a sick mutter after when I fight. 
[00:43:30]  Are you?  Yeah.  Do you just go crazy?  I'm sick, man.  I just get in there and go nuts.  You don't want to tangle with me.  I killed a few guys.  No, you didn't.  You didn't.  I'm sick.  You didn't.  Lying.  I had scandals.  Scandals.  We're going to go to break now.  When we get back, Jimmy mentioned it at the top of the show, and I did not forget, 
[00:44:00]  but we just needed to get a few things out of the show.  What did I mention?  Rob Cross, one of the shoot bosses, did an hour of radio yesterday on this channel.  Do we have audio?  Oh, boy, do we.  Oh, boy.  Was it good?  Oh, boy, was it.  Not in the way he was hoping.  And I thank the listeners for taking up our cause.  Oh, he got fucking destroyed.  We have a few clips next.  Stay there.  Hi, who's this? 
[00:44:30]  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  R.  Yeah.  E.  Goodness gracious.  T.  Yeah.  A.  Oosh.  R.  D.  T.  Retard.  Retard.  Yeah.  Woo.  Be retarded.  Be, be retarded.  Be retarded.  Be, be retarded.  Stop your hands and clap your feet.  Retardation can't be beat.  You know, you know, you know we retarded. 
[00:45:00]  T.  A.  R.  E.  T.  A.  R.  E.  Retard.  Retard.  Yeah.  Woo.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very special friend.  Ed was kind, with good intent.  But just a little different, oh, special Ed. 
[00:45:30]  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  We'd play tag, and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier, he'd eat dirt.  I like math and the spelling bee. 
[00:46:00]  Ed liked talking to a tree.  Oh, special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed.  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls. 
[00:46:30]  Ed ran headfirst in two walls.  I had girly girls and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes.  Toes like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Bobby and Ricky and Mike.  And if I love the girl, who cares who you like?  And special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread. 
[00:47:00]  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit.  I thought college life was great.  It could count from one to two.  I like people and the party scene.  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner.  Special Ed. 
[00:47:30]  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now his favorite color is the radio.  Cause he's a little bit better.  Just a little bit.  One day talking to special Ed.  He grabbed a brick and he swung at my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew. 
[00:48:00]  That special Ed just made me special too.  Ha!  My shoes hurt!  Now I laugh as I count bugs.  I give strangers great big hugs.  Next to me, it is fine.  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein.  Oh, special Ed and me. 
[00:48:30]  Now we're not right in the head, you see.  Now we're not so, not so bright.  Instead, we're a little bit special.  Oh, just a little bit special.  That fuck red made me special.  Just a little bit. 
[00:49:00]  Just a little bit special.  Don't laugh at me!  Stop laughing at me!  You stop laughing at me!  And that's funny!  Don't laugh at me!  Holy Ed!  That's a clip I've never heard before.  Was that Julia and Lewis? 
[00:49:30]  How did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Why did you do that?  Rob fucking Cross.  One of the cube bosses.  Who, uh...  I'll say this much about Rob Cross.  Yeah.  So, middle-level management around here that we don't acknowledge. 
[00:50:00]  We're way past that.  Yeah.  I think he's going to do all right someday.  Yeah, I do.  I think he's going to do all right someday.  Because of his alternative lifestyle?  Because of that, Jimmy, sure.  But we don't have time to bring him up.  You know, we're at the end of our fucking run.  We don't need to break in any new people anymore.  Nah.  The last guy we broke in, he doesn't even acknowledge that we exist at this point.  He's got an amazing position here at SiriusXM.  And quite frankly, one of the reasons is because, you know, he came up with us at another place. 
[00:50:30]  Exactly who?  We forgot about him.  Wiki?  Nah, I don't even want to say his name anymore.  But he's doing well.  Yeah, he's one of the big fucking guys around here.  And now he makes believe he doesn't even know us.  He'll give us a casual, oh, hey.  Hey.  Oh, really?  What do you mean, hey?  You know all the shit we did together?  Yeah.  That was the reason why you were off for this gig.  I had a little chit-chat there yesterday. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah?  You saw him?  Yeah, small talk.  With Bill, right?  What did you guys talk about?  This will prove my point.  Let me think.  Small talk.  Chit-chat, right?  Yeah, yeah.  A little small talk.  Chit-chat.  About what, though?  How you doing?  Nothing.  Just nothing.  Just how you doing?  How's it going?  Good, good.  You?  Yeah, yeah.  When we were making our names for ourselves, getting fired every other week. 
[00:51:30]  Nothing.  Guess what?  His stock was rising, too, which led to this.  Sure, he's a talented guy, but he needed to be working with us to get to that position.  This is true.  I used to fucking do lunch with the guy three times a week, and now I get a...  This is the stupidest business ever.  You know?  No, it's not stinky.  No, we love stinky.  People are dumb. 
[00:52:00]  Are you a Peter Pumper?  We're trying to figure out how to hire stinky.  That would be great.  Awesome Garrett.  Get him off that dumb Jay Thomas show.  I'm sure he likes being with Jay Thomas, though.  I'm not going to blow up his spot, but I would love to get stinky back.  How long has Garrett been here?  He's been here since we got fired from N.E.W., basically.  Has he been with Sirius for nine years?  Probably, yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow!  So, Rob Cross, who I do believe will be terrific in this business down the road. 
[00:52:30]  He's a good dude.  But, you know, he doesn't have knowledge that I could benefit from.  That's for sure.  He doesn't.  He did the 10 o'clock hour yesterday, Sam.  Get on mic, you fuck.  Yeah.  His name came up on the Wheel of Hosts.  That Ron Bennington came up with, by the way.  Not you.  The Wheel of Hosts.  Correct, yeah.  That was a brilliant idea from Ronnie B.  Yeah, I'm not trying to take credit for that idea. 
[00:53:00]  I would rather not do it.  And Mars was the first, and he did surprisingly well.  Yes, Mars did do well.  He hung in there.  Mars handled it like it was a real radio show.  He hung in there.  Professionalism.  Oh, boy, was he professional.  Really?  You didn't hear it?  No!  He could have gave up at any moment, but he decided,  nope, man, I'm taking this seriously, and I'm going to do the best I can in this hour.  That's great.  And then yesterday was Rob Cross's turn.  He didn't handle the show with the same professionalism? 
[00:53:30]  No.  No?  No?  No?  It seemed like Mars came in with the attitude of, I'm going to do a show, whatever it is,  you know, wherever you can throw me, I'm going to throw something back, I'm going to have  stuff to talk about, I'm going to, you know, have points of interest, blah, blah, blah,  whereas...  He prepared?  It would seem that way, because if not, he's just good on his feet, because he was talking  and he was keeping people interested, at least to some extent.  Rob Cross.  At least to some extent.  By the way, people are guessing that it's Tim Sabian.  No, that guy has decided not to even acknowledge us. 
[00:54:00]  Oh!  You don't talk to Tim?  No, man.  I've seen Tim in the hall.  We used to be really close.  He's not a dick to me, but that's...  I've chit-chatted.  Just sit down with him.  He nods like people nod at me, you know, on the sidewalk.  Oh, really?  And then the other guy sort of goes, hey, how you doing?  How's things?  Hey?  How's things doing?  How are you?  Nah, Sabian, yeah, he's in a tough position.  I know he likes us a lot, but, you know, his boss fucking hates us, so he has to make 
[00:54:30]  believe he hates us, too.  The politics around here are ridiculous.  Let me out, please.  All right, so what?  Yawn City.  I love Yawn City.  Yawn City rules.  I felt it when I was walking down there for the meeting yesterday.  I was like, ah, I'm in the Yawn City limits.  And I think the shock of leaving Yawn City and entering into Funtown really was kind of  an adjustment for Rob.  I'll say Rob took a lot of balls coming in here and hosting the show.  I respect him for coming in and trying. 
[00:55:00]  Where does Yawn City begin, Ant?  There's always a border.  Dave, Yawn City is just past the offices that you guys use.  Oh, wow.  That's early.  Yeah, because there's an energy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The energy just falls off.  But there's an energy around our offices that we don't use whatsoever.  And Sturneola sits to the left of our offices.  So that's kind of a fun area, too.  And Troy's over there trying to fucking do a mixtape or something instead of working.  Have you ever seen how the energy changes when somebody enters Funtown City? 
[00:55:30]  I mean, and Yawn City, there's an energy.  Yes, it really is.  You walk down there, there's like, the people that are working just have straight faces.  They're hunched over computers.  They're at desks and cubicles.  And there's no fun going on anymore.  None whatsoever.  When you come back in from Yawn City to Fun City, there's a tremendous boost.  Yes.  I'd be happy to demonstrate.  Oh, please do, Jimmy.  Let's see.  This is going to be a visual.  Jimmy's going to...  So wait, what are you doing now? 
[00:56:00]  Are you going to...  I'm going to show you...  But are we watching you walk away or...  Yeah, once I get down to the back, you know, once I get past the railing, I will enter Yawn City.  Yawn City.  And you'll see...  It's not a big deal, but you'll see a little perception.  A little change.  And then coming back in, you'll just see the change when one enters the city of Fun from the city of Yawn.  All right, Jimmy is walking out of our studio, down the hall toward Yawn City.  There he goes.  Look, he's got a pep in his step right now. 
[00:56:30]  His elbows side to side as he walks.  He's still in Funville.  He's old school walking.  Look at him.  He's got a little hop to his step.  He's doing an old, like, someone in the gay 90s would be walking.  With his elbows out, way out to his side.  Uh-oh, he's in the beginning of Yawn City.  There you go.  Oh, God.  It's like a marionette that someone let go of all the strings.  Now he's walking like an 85-year-old man.  Hunched over.  Completely hunched over. 
[00:57:00]  He just about was able to turn around.  He's trying to get back to Fun City.  No energy left.  Or Funtown.  What is this place called?  Oh, this is, I say Funville.  Funville?  Yeah.  He's trying to get back to Funville.  Here we go.  Now here we go.  Oh, he's back in Funville.  Ah, he's got a pep in his step.  Elbows to his side.  He's saying, he's a fine how do you do to the morning mashup people.  He just gave them the old school, how are you?  They turned around to look at him like a retard. 
[00:57:30]  Stupid face.  Very good, Jimmy.  That was a very good demonstration.  I should have filmed that.  Ooh.  The energy is dry.  It literally is like walking off a fun cliff into an open mouth going, ooh.  It is.  It's so, ugh, down there.  I don't like going down there.  Where's Dullsville, by the way?  I think Dullsville is once you make that corner into, like, Steve Blatter's office, like that L, you take the corner like that, that right there is Yon City. 
[00:58:00]  But Dullsville, wow.  When you make that left.  Like, Yon City borders on Funtown, over here where we are.  But Dullsville, oh, that has no borders on anything fun.  What's upstairs?  Oh, that's the shit, shit central.  I have no idea.  What is upstairs?  I don't know.  Have you ever been up there?  They kick it up there.  Everything gets kicked up there.  Every once in a while I have to go to the bathroom up there.  By the way, their bathroom is so much nicer than our shithole bathroom. 
[00:58:30]  That's just guys who make $100 million a year are shitting in those toilets.  Yeah.  It's a lot nicer than these fucking scum.  Upstairs is what?  Upper, upper, upper management, lawyers, and what else is up there?  Mel, the lead council, probably any board members that are here I think would be upstairs.  I've never walked around there.  Oh, I've been up there in every office.  I walk in, I go, hi, I'm one of the stars of this platform.  And I walk out.  Shit.  A lot of closed door meetings. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of decisions.  A lot of decisions.  Decisions being made.  A lot of decisions.  Ideas being ballied about.  Oh, very important up there.  That's where things are kicked.  Things are kicked upstairs and then never to be seen again.  Rob Cross.  Ah, Rob.  10 o'clock hour.  One of the lower, lower management guys.  I got to go on. 
[00:59:30]  I didn't know his name was Rob Cross.  I thought it was Rob.  Name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit.  So, Rob hosted the 10 o'clock hour yesterday.  The hour between us and Ron and Fez.  Even though Ronnie's doing more and more of the 10 o'clock hour.  And we're doing more and more of the 10 o'clock hour.  So, basically, we don't need you, Sam.  But you're doing it because I started a fun thing.  No, but if we could just get a little past 10 and Ronnie comes in a little before 11, we're 
[01:00:00]  almost connecting again.  Yeah, but if I'm almost there.  Before I was doing that, you guys were out of here like the minute you possibly could.  When that connection is made, then we certainly don't need you.  But I've just been there to make the connection.  If Ronnie could get here around 10, 20.  Why does he have to get here at 10, 20?  We don't listen by 25 minutes.  So, Rob hosted the 10 o'clock hour and we got some highlights.  Yeah.  Rob Cross comes in ready to rock, really? 
[01:00:30]  Ready to rock?  Isn't he supposed to just be introing O&A bits, though?  What happened to this hour?  It was supposed to be, hey, here's another bit from O&A.  I know.  It just mutated.  He tried that.  There was not going to be.  It's not going to be.  Because who wants to hear just a random guy?  It's easy to just intro bits.  Yeah.  We were trying to.  He went and did the hour with no bits.  Wow.  Not one bit.  Yeah.  He just did a talk show?  He did Line of the Day.  What's his old radio name?  Chuck Roast.  Because we were coming out of that donating.  Oh, God.  I forgot Chuck Roast. 
[01:01:00]  And Steve Leeds is like, hey, the return of Chuck Roast.  He was making announcements to everybody in Yawn City.  I'm like, good for you, Steve.  Trying to get the energy up over there?  Good for you.  If you want, after this, we have Chuck Roast's voiceover demo.  Ah.  Okay.  This could be a whole thing.  If you want it.  Here's Rob Cross.  He comes in ready to rock, Ant.  That's Chuck Roast.  I want to hear this.  It's Rob Cross.  And somebody's got to make room for him at one of these mics.  Ladies and gentlemen, your host for the morning, Mr. Rob Cross.  Ah, thank you.  Thank you. 
[01:01:30]  I'm upstairs.  I mean, I don't know if you want to start with an introduction or whatever, but it's your  show.  Take it away.  Well, I was upstairs taking a hearty mid-morning constitutional.  And then I stopped.  Yeah, that's exactly what I did.  I stopped by to see Pepper Hicks and heard the wheel spin live.  And, God damn, I had to book it down here.  This is a breathing heavy.  So, let's do this.  Sorry, I actually, like, in the lobby, I cut off Robin Quivers and Ronnie the limo driver  on the way out of the building so I could get here. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Let's roll.  Where's my worst of?  Be more funny.  Oh, my God.  He's out of his mind already.  You don't think that was good?  Oh, wow.  End of story.  He's panicking.  Yeah, he sat down, and I think the minute he started talking.  Literally.  What?  I think the minute that he started talking, he said, holy shit, I have to fill an hour.  And, immediately, just panicked and had nothing to say.  Nothing.  He's a mess.  You don't think that's a good one?  It's a Robin Quivers story? 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, it's amazing.  Yeah, because it's all about what's happening around here.  Yes.  Yeah, it's a real buzz.  There's all the buzz in this building.  A real buzz.  Mars got involved in Rob Cross's hour, I see.  Well, there was a room full of people in the beginning trying to see who the wheel landed  on.  Mm-hmm.  And this was Mars' contribution.  Okay, let's listen to Mars, who did a pretty good job on Monday.  He did.  No, no, no.  Mars did a great job yesterday.  I really enjoyed MMA talk and men hitting on you. 
[01:03:00]  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  But you know what the difference is today?  What's that?  That I was in here by myself.  That's true.  That makes a big difference.  It does, yeah.  When you got the boss in here, you get a little intimidated.  And when you got a smartass over there shooting questions at you, derailing you, that also  makes it difficult.  So you're saying everyone should leave the studio?  Yeah.  Okay.  Aw.  Wow, really?  Oh, that sucks.  What a gross.  Yeah, well, at least I have the callers. 
[01:03:30]  Well, give out the phone number.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  Anybody want to call?  Rob's going to prove one of my points today.  What's that?  Well, there's a lot of...  That he should be executed?  He should be executed.  There's a lot of guys coming up in the radio business.  And this is...  You're going to learn today why you should never listen to bosses.  Because they don't know how to do fucking radio.  So why are they telling you what to do?  This is a prime example of that.  And most guys never learn this lesson. 
[01:04:00]  And that's why they're stuck in these one-market towns doing the same old shit over and over  again, hoping to get the call.  He didn't even follow his own rules.  He didn't get the phone number.  He didn't tell you what his name was.  He didn't set the show up.  No.  All right.  Here he goes.  He starts taking calls, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Let's get these guys to intern, sir.  All right.  We're working on it.  That one's been kicked upstairs.  It's an action item.  Oh, the lines are lit. 
[01:04:30]  This is awesome.  Let's go to line five.  You're like on the air.  Hello.  Yeah, hey.  Am I in the air?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good times.  Yeah, it's after Opie and Anthony live, by the way.  Please don't associate our name with this.  I don't want the spinning wheel.  I got a question for Rob Croft.  Yeah, yeah.  When do you get an intern? 
[01:05:00]  I told you.  That's an action item.  We've kicked it upstairs.  All right.  Line six.  Son of a bitch.  This shit sucks.  Bring back Mars.  Son of a bitch.  That shit sucks isn't even a proper sentence.  I don't think there's no subject to that.  Is this good, Jimmy?  What's happening? 
[01:05:30]  I'm looking at my phone.  I like this grammar bit right there.  Yeah, it is actually good.  It was fun.  He corrected the guy.  There's got to be some people who like management.  Line three.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Line three.  Hey, man.  What are you guys doing?  Yeah.  Take a call from people who love management.  Yeah, well, you ain't even doing a good job, man.  What do you mean?  How am I not doing a good job?  You just ain't saying nothing.  You just kind of messing around.  I'm taking calls from my fans.  Come on! 
[01:06:00]  This bag of shit should program a shotgun and eat it!  Come on!  All right.  That's only good.  Line four.  Line four.  Let's kill Henry.  Eric, who's...  Sam, are you hitting the phones or is it Eric?  I don't know.  Eric.  Eric, God, man.  You've got to move faster.  Let's go.  Oh, shit, Jim.  He stepped on my other line.  Oh, shit.  He doesn't even understand to shut the fuck up during a Ramone call.  I don't even know if he knew that that was Jim. 
[01:06:30]  Really?  I don't think he did.  He wasn't even smart enough to know that, huh?  No.  Your callers suck on this show.  Look, it's not...  You can't...  They're not even...  They're not even into you.  I mean, I...  You can't blame the callers.  I don't.  All right.  Good point.  Line five.  It's Lyle.  Lyle.  Hey, your last name is Cross.  You probably would have just been hanging up or something around a vampire's neck.  Line six. 
[01:07:00]  Line six.  You stealing a lot of something?  Line six, please.  Like a menorah or something.  You taking a cross?  Oh, my God.  She was a...  I remember when you were small.  Oh, no.  And I used to babysit you.  And you used to crawl in there.  And I'd catch you...  I'd catch you looking up at my private parts.  But then you said you was looking at the TV. 
[01:07:30]  I went, oh.  This has gotten awkward.  Yeah.  Er.  Two places at one time.  Come back in, Jimmy.  All right.  Line seven.  Okay.  What's up?  You're on Oprah at...  You're on Oprah?  After Oprah and Anthony live.  You're fixed you on my feet, you fucking dick.  What? 
[01:08:00]  Fix what?  The online feed.  Oh, fix that.  Oh, yeah.  I was going to do that right now.  I had to host this show for the next 40 minutes.  The online feed is going to be jacked for a bit.  At least he came in and did it, though.  Wow, this is horrible.  I know.  At least he came in and did it.  He evolved to do it.  I guess we don't care about ratings, huh?  Not anymore.  It's satellite radio.  And then one more came in.  During the Rob Cross Hour. 
[01:08:30]  All right, line four.  You're on with management on After 1A Live.  Okay.  Hey.  All right, go ahead.  Call her.  Hello?  Am I on the show?  Fuck yeah.  Is this Chuck Rose?  Yes.  Hey, this is Danny in the back office.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, can I get a raise?  Oh.  He hung up.  Oh, shit.  That's another action.  That's been kicked upstairs.  But can I ask a question?  Why did they call him Chuck Rose?  That's his old radio name.  That was his old radio name.  No, it wasn't.  Yes. 
[01:09:00]  No, it wasn't.  Chuck Rose.  Don't you have the disc?  Yeah.  You have a fucking disc with Chuck Rose?  This is him as an actual DJ?  This is a commercial voiceover demo.  Commercial voiceover demo?  Yeah.  By Chuck Rose?  I don't know where the guys found it.  So what happens?  When you fail at being on air, then you go into management?  I think that's what happens.  No one's ever left fucking...  I don't think people want to be in management when they start in radio.  I think we all start as college jocks hoping for the big time. 
[01:09:30]  Hoping for the big time.  Entertainment.  You're making people laugh.  You're playing music.  Whatever it is.  You don't want to be the guy in yawn town.  You don't want to be the yawn city.  You don't start as a management guy ever.  I don't remember anybody in college radio going, you know what?  I want to be in management.  You want to be in fun town?  No.  They all start as on-air jocks.  Yeah.  Here's his demo tape.  Chuck Rose.  Hook up the Zircom wireless LAN module to your palm handheld.

Introducing X-Game Skateboarding with eight pro skaters, 40 tricks and signature moves, 
[01:10:30]  and a few hundred thousand screaming fans.  Oh, I get that most DJs sound like overbearing fake windbags.  I hate those people.  By deciding to keep on listening, you've just demonstrated a key American freedom.  Choice.  And should you choose to turn it off, take a nap, or dye your hair blue, that's cool too.  So take a second to celebrate all the little liberties you have.  Or choose to take them for granted.  It's a free country.  Think you know twisted?  Not until you've tried all new Slice. 
[01:11:00]  It's orange soda with a wicked twist of lemon and lime.  Miller Lite.  Proud sponsor of the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Yeah.  It's all right.  I mean, he's not going to make any money at it.  No, no.  He's not doing a completely cheesy radio voice.  Yeah, yeah.  That could have been a lot worse.  Yeah, it could have been.  He could have had to hear it twice.  It's all right.  He could do tags.  Yeah, he could do tags.  Good for him.  He could fucking drop the ends on, you know, donuts of... 
[01:11:30]  I don't mind Rob.  He's all right.  Yeah, Rob's a good kisser.  They're all all right.  I mean, you know...  Yeah, they're nice people.  They're cute.  That's a perfect term.  You know, it's...  They don't have any knowledge for us.  It's like, aw.  Blatter means well.  He just makes odd faces at you.  Like, you know, you'll say something...  That's the...  Holy shit. 
[01:12:00]  I'm kind of agreeing, but I won't verbalize it in case you're recording this.  He's been around a little longer.  He knows all the tricks.  He does know the deal.  He communicates with faces.  He knows the pitfalls.  He's not sure if we're wired.  Yeah.  I want to be wired for that meeting yesterday.  So bad.  Oh, that would have been a good one.  Yeah.  I'm always wired for meetings.  Always.  It's smart.  Wear a wire?  You wearing a wire?  Pat him down.  Pat him down.  Yep.  Take your fucking shirt off.  You know what sucks about doing what we just did?  It sucks the energy out of the room. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, like playing bad clips?  Yeah.  It was so bad that I think it just sucked the energy out of the room.  Oh, man.  You know what I mean?  Like, there was nothing to that that we could fucking even goof on.  He's just that bad.  Was that a one-day thing?  You spin the wheel of hosts?  All week.  I have to do it all week.  Now, who's today?  Well, it depends who the wheel lands on.  No, I know.  The wheel part of it is all fake.  Who's today?  Yeah, come on now.  Obviously.  Oh, the wheel.  Let's tear down a wall here.  Who's today?  We get it.  I mean, the wheel's fake.  The wheel's not fake.  Good.  No, it's fake. 
[01:13:00]  It's in the other room.  You already know who the whole week is going to be.  They have to be available.  Don't listen to me.  They have to know when they're going to be on.  So they're on schedule something else.  There's no wheel of spontaneity in this fucking place.  So tell us who it is today, and then when you spin the wheel later, people will be in on the gag.  Right.  And other people will hear the wheel thinking that it was random.  Yeah, don't worry.  Who's today's host?  Well, I mean, it could be Roland.  It could be Roland.  And he's on the wheel still. 
[01:13:30]  How many people are on the wheel?  Roland's on the wheel.  Troy's on the wheel.  Right.  Although Troy has nighttime gigs, so he's been losing more sleep throughout the week.  And the height of his sleeplessness will be Thursday.  So when you randomly spin the wheel, it's going to land on Troy Thursday?  That would be bad for Troy.  I don't know.  When does it randomly fall on E-Rock?  E-Rock has removed his name from the wheel.  What a fucking asshole.  Oh, God.  Wait, no, he hasn't.  E-Rock just doesn't want to do anything.  What's wrong with you, E-Rock?  You taking your name off the wheel? 
[01:14:00]  No.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, I've got to run everything here while everyone else is hosting.  Run everything here?  What do you have to run?  What do you run?  You push the button.  What do you have to run?  Let someone else run the thing.  Is there a barbecue back there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock, why can't you be on the radio, too?  Yeah, why can't you be on the radio?  E-Rock.  I'm on enough.  Well, give some other people a chance.  What?  Oh.  I think if you ask the fans, you're not on quite enough.  He does help co-host with whoever's in.  All right.  Oh, he does?  He does, yeah.  He's on with Rob. 
[01:14:30]  I've heard him co-host with you.  Yeah, he's on with me when I'm on.  Yeah, you get a different E-Rock than you get on this show.  Yeah.  When does E-Rock get to host it?  He hasn't expressed any interest in doing that.  Well, too fucking bad.  Language.  Ouch.  I have no interest in this, but I'm here every day.  Wow.  You should have something.  We knew it!  Hey!  He showed his cards today.  Finally, we hear the truth.  About time he's honest with us.  He showed his cards. 
[01:15:00]  For years!  You mean nothing, idiots.  You can tell!  Just phone it in, guys!  Right.  Get me a phone.  Yeah, maybe like E-T will phone home a time.  Ah, right, Chip!  I'm saying.  I got zooted.  So Roland's going to host today.  If the wheel lands on him.  Of course.  If the wheel lands on him.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Who knows? 
[01:15:30]  Mm-hmm.  You never know.  You don't.  You never know.  Oh, we never know, huh?  You don't.  Can I bet on that wheel, then?  Can I maybe put a few bucks down that maybe Roland, the wheel hit on Roland today?  I mean, the odds are better for Roland now because two names have been removed from the  wheel.  Right.  So how are the odds better?  Because before, Rob Cross and Mars were on the wheel, so there were more sections of the  wheel.  Now there are less wheel sections.  So it's more favorable that Roland will get picked.  Right. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So three to one odds?  Yeah.  Perhaps.  Perhaps.  All right.  So I got three to one on my money?  Well, I don't know who's controlling the gambling on this.  I don't know who's in charge of that.  Who's in charge of the gambling?  The Russian mob.  If that's the case, that may be.  They're involved.  Yeah.  Need a bookie.  Sandy Kane was on America's Got Talent.  We're going to change gears.  That Rob Cross thing was just very, very, very bad.  I saw that disaster in Times Square. 
[01:16:30]  Rob Cross?  Yeah.  Doing a remote?  I was walking through Times Square and, first of all, I fucking hate Times Square.  If one of those fucking brothers gets in my face and tries to hand me a disc again, it's  like, what am I?  The whole place is carnies and rubes.  Everyone's a mark walking through there.  What's with the black guy holding up the big sign that says, free hugs? 
[01:17:00]  You ever see him?  Yeah.  So what does he hug people and take their wallets?  Is that his gimmick?  Probably a sex addict.  He probably just rubs his cock on people.  Yeah, yeah.  And just comes in his pants.  I would love to do that.  But the guys, the black, like, you like comedy?  You like comedy?  It's like, shut the fuck up.  Who's on your little comedy sheet at a club that I've never heard of?  You're so mean, asshole.  Some shithole.  Because it's all, they're all just fucking worms waiting to fucking find a mark to pull 
[01:17:30]  one over on.  And it ain't me, you cocksucker.  I didn't think it was you.  Well, they do.  Trying to hand me their dumb disc.  Yo, yo, yo.  Yo, yo, yo.  Why are you hanging out in Times Square, then?  I was walking from point A to point B.  No, I know.  It's convenient, but.  I had to walk to the new Compound West, the apartment.  So I had to walk through Times Square.  So you're dealing with these fucking people. 
[01:18:00]  That dumb, filthy, smelly Elmo that walks around.  Fucking, I saw Elvis with a fucking brand new backpack on.  And that's always, it takes the realism right out of the picture.  They got Elvis down there now?  Yeah, Elvis is down there.  And the fact that he's dead.  And he's doing Elvis moves.  Like, some dumb fucking hillbilly and his son goes,  Hey, it's Elvis.  And I'm walking.  And Elvis had to do like a karate move in front of him. 
[01:18:30]  But he turned and stopped right in front of me to do his karate move.  And I just went, Ah, fuck.  And I had to walk around dumb Elvis.  I'm disgusted with Times Square.  I'd rather it be full of hookers and porno theaters.  Like the good old days or Jimmy's house.  You gotta call the Guinness Book of World Records  because I think you're the youngest grumpy old man ever.  I am.  You're not old enough to be that grumpy.  I really am just a grump.  Do you give to the homeless? 
[01:19:00]  Uh, no.  Why not?  Not anymore.  You know what?  I don't give to anyone.  Those fucking idiots that stand there with the water jugs.  Come on, come on.  Give to the homeless.  Come on.  One guy's going.  He goes, Sir, Sir.  Let me see you smile.  Let me see you smile.  There you go.  Nice.  And all I'm thinking is smile?  Thank God this fuck didn't pick me.  Thank God he didn't go, Sir, Sir, to me and turn around.  I go, let me see you smile.  Smile?  I like a smile.  You motherfucker. 
[01:19:30]  I'll show you two middle fingies.  Why can't you smile?  Give him a smile, Ant.  He's on the street, that guy.  Because he's out there under the guise of helping the homeless, and every penny that  goes in that fucking filth ridden water jug is going to booze and drugs for him.  And he's taking pictures with people, with tourists, dumb fucking Midwestern shithead tourists that think it's for real.  They think this is a town square in Wisconsin? 
[01:20:00]  Listen, no, it's New York City.  They'd be playing three card money if the cops didn't work him over for it.  Come on.  The homeless guy, when he goes, even a penny counts?  What do you say to that?  You know what I yell at those people now?  What?  I swear to you.  The guys with the jugs and the fucking glass containers with the fake fucking tablecloth on the table.  Please give.  Please give to the homeless.  They need it.  Warm meals.  Warm meals.  I go, I turn around, I go, yeah, I do my share. 
[01:20:30]  You take half my money.  You got plenty.  The guy doesn't get it.  He's just trying to shill every rube walking through that place.  And that fucking pedestrian mall that that questionable fucking sexuality head muckity muck that runs this city decided to put in.  You don't like the idea of that?  It just makes more room for more rubes and more fucking carnies. 
[01:21:00]  That's it.  There used to be cars running through there.  They couldn't stand there and hawk their shit and play their spackle buckets and have their Elvis backpack people.  But now it has the feel of an outdoor mall.  That's nice, right?  Oh, is that what it's supposed to do?  Isn't that nice?  Is that what it's supposed to be?  An outdoor mall full of pickpocketers?  Isn't it nice?  And fucking people that are extorting money out of you through threats and intimidation when they hand you a CD? 
[01:21:30]  Yo, here's my shit.  Did some fat rhymes, yo.  I got my rhymes on here.  And it's like, oh, well, okay.  And they autograph it for you.  I'll take it.  It's like, yo, let me autograph that for you.  Well, that's okay.  And meanwhile, the guy's just scared pissless of a New York black guy.  So he autographs it and hands it to him.  He goes, thanks.  He goes, yo, yo, my man, my man, where are you going?  That's $5.  And the guy digs in for $5 because he's scared shit that he's going to get fucking knifed.  Or they ask you for your name and they autograph it so you can't give it back. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, what's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name?  I wrote your name on it.  I don't know why, too, because the only time I'm going through Times Square, I'm going somewhere.  But I ought to go there just to fuck with these people and have them go, yo, what's your name?  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah, write it down.  Anthony.  Yeah, that's good.  I'm taking it.  Yo, my man, where's my money?  You don't get money.  I get this.  You don't get money.  Now what?  Now what are you going to do, Holmes? 
[01:22:30]  I want to do that.  Do it.  Film it.  Yeah, I will.  Now what, Holmes?  30 clips come out.  Yeah, well, I'll have to bring some extra clips.  Oh, God damn it.  I think the city's in cahoots with the crooks.  Oh, it is.  Because they have the big screen.  It's a gimmick.  Listen to this gimmick.  So they have a big screen, and the rubes walk by and go, hey, that's me up there.  Have you seen that?  And they're distracted, looking at themselves on the big screen in Times Square.  And as they're doing that, there's somebody picking their pockets. 
[01:23:00]  Pick pockets, stealing their kids.  Right.  Shoving their dicks in girls.  Whatever the fuck they're doing.  Hey, it's me up there.  You see that giant screen?  That's the dumbest thing.  Oh, and the people are pointing like, oh.  They look just as dumb as everyone that looked into the fucking monitor on The Price is Right.  Oh, God.  And they sit there and be like, oh, they're not looking at the camera.  They're looking up to the ceiling.  That's a good observation.  Pointing at it.  That's what they look like, right? 
[01:23:30]  That's money halls touching your dick.  Yeah.  Touching your dick.  I hate the Times Square.  I hate Times Square.  And I hate all the fucking rubes.  That's, you know, on Twitter, you get people, fans of the show, they're like, hey, coming  to New York for the first time.  I see you guys out there.  And you're always asked the same thing.  And I can't write everyone back.  It says, I'm going to New York.  What would you suggest?  And my only suggestion would be this.  Stay the fuck away from Times Square and see New York.  Don't even go to Times Square.  There's nothing there for you. 
[01:24:00]  Central Park is awesome in the summer.  There's a lot of shit going on in there.  Go down downtown.  Soho, the West Village.  Some meatpacking.  Go have a great dinner.  They've got some great restaurants in the meatpacking district.  It's just Times Square.  What do you want to go to?  The Olive Garden?  Go to the South Street Seaport before you go to Times Square.  That's kind of a cool little area.  Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge above the cars.  That's an amazing little thing to do.  I hate that asshole mayor.  Because you know what it is?  That fucking rich elitist gets wherever he wants to go with security. 
[01:24:30]  He never has to sit in fucking the traffic we do on 8th Avenue.  The nerve of this motherfucker to cut into roads and put potted plants?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  It's a big pedestrian mall.  It's a fucking city.  And you're just hanging out with other people visiting New York.  So you're not even getting the feel of the city at all.  And it's all franchise shit.  Olive Garden?  Really?  You can do that alone.  When I see a line of these fucking roofs to get into the Olive Garden and you're visiting 
[01:25:00]  New York City.  Yeah, why?  Do you know how many fucking amazing Italian restaurants are in New York City?  You could have done that in your hometown.  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  I don't get that.  I don't understand that at all.  Sorry, if you go to a good restaurant, you might not get unlimited breadsticks.  Right.  Oh, look out.  Yeah, go to Little Italy.  I mean, that's sort of a tourist trap, but it's different than Times Square.  Yeah.  Go to fucking Chinatown, man.  See the weird shit going on down there.  Something good.  God, that place is just the worst.  Why would you get a hotel right around Times Square and just walk around for three days 
[01:25:30]  in Times Square?  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  This is New York, boy.  Let me tell you.  And you see the tourists taking pictures of the big M&M fucking building?  Gives a shit.  The M&M thing is kind of cool just because they have a million fucking colors in there,  but that's a five-minute trip.  Yeah, but then go in, check it out, and then take a subway somewhere.  I'm not quite the Matterhorn bobsled.  True.  Fucking just a store.  It's all stores.  And the fucking dumb electronics stores. 
[01:26:00]  Come in.  Buy something for the ten times what it would cost anywhere else.  And it's broken, and there is no warranty.  Those stupid fucking electronics places.  And then they bring the box out from the back, and it's obvious that the box was open already.  Bait and switch, yeah.  Did they do that?  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  In their window, they have a shitload of electronics and cameras and stuff,  and the prices on them are like, really, three bucks for that camera? 
[01:26:30]  Dude, didn't we get fucked?  And you go in, and it's like, oh, yes, the $3 camera, not there, no more.  You have the $500 one.  And you remember way back when they put me up in a hotel,  and you were stuck with your wife on Long Island?  Yeah.  And you came in to see me, and I was telling you about how, holy shit,  there's naked fucking people all over the place.  Binoculars, yeah.  And remember, we went to Times Square and got binoculars.  We got ripped off that day.  Totally ripped off.  But we needed them so badly.  But this guy sold them like you could see planets with this thing.  Great deal, my friend.  Great deal, my friend. 
[01:27:00]  Right.  Was it a great deal?  Oh, it was a great deal for him.  These binoculars made things maybe twice as big.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Yeah.  And we needed to see across a whole city block to these amazing windows where there were naked women all over the fucking place.  I swear, at first I thought I was holding them up backwards to my head where it makes binoculars make things look further away.  Like, wait a minute.  Is it?  What?  Digital world.  Yeah, those places stay the fuck away from them, man.  Never go in there. 
[01:27:30]  They rip you off big time.  500% markup.  We were guilty of it, certainly, but we learned our lesson.  Hey, this is a great question from Seth in Illinois, one of our regulars.  What's a rube?  I say it all the time.  What is that based on?  What is the definition of a rube?  A rube is somebody that's, it's a mark.  It's someone that's easily taken.  Is this the official definition?  Yeah, yeah.  They're naive.  They're easily taken for money or any other valuable or they're just, they're somebody that doesn't understand. 
[01:28:00]  Somebody else is pulling something over on them.  They are the rube.  The other guy's the carny or the fucking, you know, the guy with the power.  The rube is just the fucking.  So they're marks.  The hillbilly, the fucking hayseed.  They're the marks.  And I just look around and go, oh, look at that mark.  Oh, you dummy.  It's all those dumb fucking girls that wrap themselves around the naked cowboy to take a picture. 
[01:28:30]  It just, yeah, here's the, it's a noun, informal.  An unsophisticated person from a rural area, a hick.  But it does have another definition.  It's like, it is somebody that could just be easily taken.  Oh, let's, this guy, this guy actually runs one of the big billboards in Times Square.  I think we, David, we've talked to you before, right?  Yeah, we've talked before.  Yeah, you're the one that I, you know, we want you to do some outrageous Opie and Anthony thing in Times Square that gets, uh. 
[01:29:00]  I'll tell you your mom's box moment, I'll tell you that much.  I know.  You just let us know when you're, you've had it with that job and we'll go out together with this thing.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  So, yeah, we have a photo booth in our store and people come in, none of them even, they're not even from here, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  And, uh, they don't, they come up, they put in all their information.  You know how everybody's worried about Big Brother and all, oh, Big Brother knows where I'm going, I don't want Easy Pass.  These people put all their information into a computer, get their photo taken, and then they're like, why did I just do this? 
[01:29:30]  And we're like, because it's going to show up outside on the big billboard.  And they're like, oh, oh, I don't want that.  So they don't even know what they're doing.  Dude, they stand in line.  They stand in line for like a half hour to wait for this.  Wait, they stand in line for a half hour.  This is a perfect example of Rubes.  They stand in line for a half hour so they can see their face on the big Times Square billboard?  Yeah, it's the one that has a big tower.  I don't want to say specifically, but it's on 46th.  Well, there's the other one that's just live.  And as you're walking by, you go, wait a minute, that person, oh my God, that's me. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  And then you stop and start waving like an asshole.  Yeah, they wave.  And then the thing about that is the idea is to have something like that to pull them into the store.  But that one, you're all the way across the street.  So you wave and you take a picture of yourself waving.  That's what they do.  They're taking pictures of the screen of them waving.  I'm a big fan of Central Park.  And I see people walk through there.  I like your big gash video, too, by the way.  Oh, the yoga video. 
[01:30:30]  I really do like that one.  I haven't really pushed that enough.  But the lady airing out her crotch and you can see her pink panties in the middle of Sheep Meadow in front of families is a great video.  Because people were like, what the fuck is this woman doing?  Artsy shit.  I wasn't bothered.  I wasn't bothered that she was airing out her pussy in Sheep Meadow.  And so they hate artsy shit.  Artsy shit.  Look at that, though.  Two broads.  One's doing yoga on the top of the other one's feet.  And I zoom right into the pink panties.  Look at this. 
[01:31:00]  It's so stupid.  Look, she's just airing out her cunt.  What year is this?  1968?  Exactly.  Quit showing you.  Would you take some acid, man?  And then we have so many listeners that don't get it.  I tweeted or said something like, you know, she's airing out her crotch in front of families.  Like, I changed.  Like, that bothers me now.  I'm like, no, you idiot.  I'm just pointing out that this broad was doing this in front of a lot of people that would care that she's airing out her pussy.  That's like all the rooves that believe Anthony thinks this chick in Florida is innocent. 
[01:31:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, exactly.  She's probably the best thing ever is looking at Anthony's Twitter and these idiots believe in what he's saying.  Hey, you see that fucking meter reader yesterday?  Nah, man.  Nah, well, let me tell you.  The old man supposedly is in the picture, too.  She's walking.  She's walking.  She's walking.  And Casey Anthony will be at my 4th of July party.  Nice.  If you can get that to happen.  He used to work down in Florida.  We used to deliver pizzas on that street where they found that little girl. 
[01:32:00]  Oh, yeah?  Wow.  Yeah.  He's a little gay, though, now.  He lives down there on Orange Blossom Trail.  All right, Dave.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  All right, later, guys.  You're better when it said, you know, about talking about billboards.  Oh, Bill.  All right, Dave.  Thank you, sir.  I know you're a big fan of the show and support us, and thanks.  All right.  Where were we?  You don't have to hand me things while I'm walking through Times Square.  You don't like when they hand you a rap CD?  Flicking those things.  Flick. 
[01:32:30]  Flick.  Flick.  And then they're like, comedy.  You like comedy?  And I usually turn around and go, no, I hate it.  You don't like the rap CDs they hand out?  No.  What are you, just handing shit out in Times Square?  Where are you big, oh, you're a big rapper, are you?  No, you're a fucking, you're intimidating fucking Midwestern white people to give you $5.  Yeah.  And they're dressed very intimidating-like, like gangbangers. 
[01:33:00]  Why are the cops allowing that?  Because they've pushed everything else out of Times Square.  I don't know.  There's probably some kind of weird fucking loophole going on.  Yeah, you're not asking for money, you're not selling anything, you're just handing out  your rap CD, it's legal.  Yeah.  Get the, you know, if you fucking, no, it's probably part of the diversity of New York.  Oh, the diversity of Times Square.  You want diversity?  Bring back the peep shows.  Yeah.  Those who are fun.  You never know what's popping through that hole.  Yes.  That's diverse.  Exactly.  Is it cut?  Is it uncut?  Is it black or white?  Oh, who gives a turkey? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, I didn't finish my stupid Central Park thing, so I see these rubes walking through  Central Park, too, and they have their video camera on.  Yeah.  Like, I film shit, sure, but they just have it on.  No, they just have it on.  As they're walking, and I'm thinking, now what?  You go home, and you're going to relive your walk through Central Park?  Yeah.  Because they never turn it off.  They're just walking with it.  Here's Central Park.  Here's a little more of it.  What would you do with that?  What would you do? 
[01:34:00]  You know they're not editing something nice together.  Oh, God, it's just, I hate it.  My brother, he came up, it's brilliant, too.  He's got a video camera, he's got a family and all that, so, you know, he wants to videotape  stuff.  He has a rule.  I forgot the exact time, but I think it's a 30-second rule.  He only turns his camera on for 30 seconds, no matter what.  Yeah, why would you?  So if it's a birthday party, 30 seconds.  Happy birthday, here's the end, here's this, here's that, okay, and off. 
[01:34:30]  Unless he gets a jumper from a building.  Oh, yeah.  The 10th story, he's got to shut it off right before the big cursed splat.  But then when he pops his videotapes in at these family functions, it moves nicely.  They move.  Here's Thanksgiving, here's Christmas, here's New Year's, here's da-da-da-da-da, all in  10 minutes.  It's nice.  It's really smart.  Nothing beats the editing program.  I mean, nothing beats it.  But who has time to edit their shit?  That's just it.  You know, if you're going to take some care and want to subject your dumb friends and family 
[01:35:00]  to your home videos, you better edit those things and make them move.  We're speaking for everyone, by the way, because it's Times Square here, but every city has this  shit.  And Durwood in Philly has a nice sense of feedback here.  He goes, what's a rube?  A mark.  Ask Ronnie B.  Yep.  Opie, where do you get cheesesteaks in Philly?  If you say Pats or Geno's, you're in Times Square.  You're in the Times Square of Philly.  Take a drive along the river to Henry Avenue. 
[01:35:30]  Geno's is good, though, right?  I've never been.  I've had cheesesteaks in Philly, and honestly, they're just amazing wherever you go.  I don't think Geno's or Pats are that much better.  Cheesesteaks are so good, dude.  They're amazing.  I would love to go right now and have a cheesesteak.  Would you like one right now?  With a Diet Coke.  Not for the weight, but I just like Diet Coke.  I don't know what it is, but New York can't just, they just can't make it.  Why?  Hey, what's going on?  Let's get a cheesesteak.  What's going on?  What's going on?  It's over there.  You want to go over there and get a cheesesteak?  Over there. 
[01:36:00]  I'd love to.  When I visit Philly, which is very often, I grab a cheesesteak for the ride home, man,  every fucking time.  Put that shit on my lap, lay out the paper on my lap, and I'm just chowing down on a  cheesesteak as I drive up to New Jersey Turnpike.  I can't do that, man.  Every single fucking time.  I can't drive and eat.  Oh, my God.  It's an art form.  I'm too worried about getting grease on my luxury vehicle.  Ah, yeah, yeah.  No, I just don't like it from a crash.  Oh, nah.  I don't like the new car smell to get messed up by fucking greasy. 
[01:36:30]  I want a fucking cheesesteak so bad right now.  I could just crave a one right now again.  Dude, I...  Fuck!  Remember when the girls from YSP would run up the cheesesteaks?  Oh, the girls.  How great was that?  And then not fuck us?  The girls.  Troy knows a cheesesteak place in the city?  He's from Pennsylvania.  Where's Troy?  But does he know a place in New York?  And are they open right now?  Can we get them?  God.  Are they open now?  All right, Troy, relax.  Does he have his culottes on?  Does he? 
[01:37:00]  Troy?  Wow, they're extra long.  He only comes in with man pants on.  Troy's a smart kid.  There's a place on the Lower East Side called 99 Miles to Philly.  And it's actually pretty good, pretty authentic cheesesteaks.  Where are they open?  That's far away.  Are they open now?  I would probably guess 99 miles from here.  You know.  I don't know.  We can look into it, but yeah, I don't think...  God, Jim.  That's raging bullshit right there.  No, it's just, you know, it's a good one.  I don't think we have time to go to the Lower East Side.  Time's all we got, my friend. 
[01:37:30]  By the way, for the tortoise...  Ah, Bill Tetley.  You want to see some shit, go to the Lower East Side.  That's where the old New York is happening.  Yeah!  With the junkies and the artists and all that shit's going on.  Just don't go too late.  But you want to see what New York used to be like.  And don't go to...  Like, like, like.  Don't go to Bryant Park if you're a conservative.  Because Glenn Beck...  Oh, yeah.  Went there to go see one of those outdoor movies with his family.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  And, um...  What happened to Glenn Beck?  Well, first...  Where was this?  At Lower East Side?  Yeah, Bryant Park.  Okay.  One of his, um...  They put a blanket out and, uh...  Someone kicked a wine or champagne glass on his wife's back and...  And pointed right in his face and said,  We don't like conservatives here.  Get the...  And then my daughter...  My...  My daughter sank.  And there he is crying.  He was crying?  Oh, yes.  Where was this?  I don't know. 
[01:38:30]  Is it on TV?  Some link somewhere on his new fucking webcast.  He's pathetic, man.  He's getting thrown off a fox.  Is he thrown off a fox or is he leaving?  He doesn't need to...  Look.  Why was he getting thrown off?  What do you think?  Look.  Do you mind a ratings here?  Even...  I would imagine that Fox, you know...  He's too controversial.  Here's the deal.  I've heard things.  Let's just say that.  What have you heard, my father?  I've...  He wouldn't leave Fox.  I've traveled...  I've traveled the hallways of Fox News being one of their, um...  You know...  Lackies!  One of their go-to guys. 
[01:39:00]  You're one of their go-to buys.  I've heard that, um...  Glenn Beck, even for Fox, was just too fucking far out there.  And, uh...  His ratings are doing very well, but it was very hard for them to sell his show because  he's just...  Comes off like a lunatic.  But...  It's entertaining to some people, right?  Or do you think there's too much pressure?  Yeah, but it's so angering to other people. 
[01:39:30]  It's so infuriating.  And people see him as being a panicky Pete hate monger.  Um...  I honestly don't think he is.  Is he?  I've never watched his show.  I don't know what he does.  I couldn't watch his show and take him seriously to the point where I'd be like, oh boy, wow,  this guy, something needs to be done about this gentleman.  I mean, because it's just...  He's got his dumb little goofy blackboards and he writes things down and tells you what's  going to happen in the world and it's all doom and gloom.  And, uh...  Why do they care? 
[01:40:00]  Why do people give a shit?  Like, I don't know why it bothers people.  Who fucking cares?  Everything bothers people.  Oberman's a cunt, but I don't want him to be not able to say what he wants.  Leave the guy alone.  Yeah, for some reason, though, they were just like, look, this guy's kind of going beyond  the brand here.  Oh, right, okay.  Yeah.  They got a certain brand.  They got to uphold.  Yeah.  You know, Hannity's one thing.  Obviously, right-wing conservative.  But, uh, he doesn't come off like...  A lunatic.  Like panicky Pete right-wing conservative. 
[01:40:30]  Glenn Beck.  Do you think that they asked Beck to tone it down?  Maybe.  Maybe they did.  And he said, go shit in your hat.  Go shit in your hat.  He blew it.  He blew a good gig.  When's he leaving?  Because he doesn't want to leave Fox.  Yeah, I don't believe that.  I don't believe that shit ever.  Something like that?  He wants to stay on Fox.  Probably does, because all I saw him on was some Glenn Beck, uh, media webcast thing or  something.  Yeah.  GB Media?  I don't know.  But he can still do his own radio show, right?  Or does he? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, I'm sure he does.  Personal story of cultural elitists.  We want the video, though.  Yeah, the video's the one.  I want the video of Glenn Beck.  Went to Bryant Park.  I just wanted to.  I had a dream of watching a movie.  No.  That dream didn't come true.  I left Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees.  What happened?  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player. 
[01:41:30]  How'd that work out for you, by the way?  How'd that work out?  Please tell us.  Did the dream come true?  What happened?  What happened?  I beg God, the dream came true.  End of story.  Is there a video of that?  I think so.  Oh, I would love to see a video of that.  There has to be.  What makes that great?  Mike Schmidt was a tough dude, man.  Yeah.  Philly mustache.  Turned into a fucking...  Mike Schmidt didn't play.  Let's see.  Didn't fucking play.  He was the real deal as far as Philly sports go.  The real deal. 
[01:42:00]  Who was that?  Who was the real deal?  Bill Tetley.  All right.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Tetley.  He was a boxer.  They said the last name twice.  I don't know why.  Oh, the real deal was a boxer.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  The real deal.  Holyfield?  Was it Holyfield was the real deal?  Yep.  Very good.  Yep, there you go.  How long is this Glenn Beck clip?  Thank you.  Thank you, people.  It's not long?  All right.  This is the clip you're talking about, Ant?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:42:30]  I think it gets choked up, right?  Last night.  How much New York hates people like me.  We don't care enough to hate people like you.  They didn't find any irony in the fact that they were yelling at me about diversity while  they were trying to silence diversity of opinion.  Yeah.  My daughter said to me last night, because she wrote to my wife apologizing, she said, 
[01:43:00]  I really didn't think it would be like that.  How old is his daughter?  One.  Very smart kid.  It's a prodigy.  Is his daughter a little older?  I have no idea.  Lives in New York?  I guess it was the daughter's idea to go to the park.  It was.  The daughter said, hey, Dad, let's go to Bryant Park.  They're playing a Hitchcock movie, and let's go.  And he's like, ah, yeah, yeah, and she goes, no, come on. 
[01:43:30]  He goes, all right, you go down with a blanket and stuff and set everything up, and I'll come  by later and just kind of, you know, hunker down and do that.  But he said he was just harassed and had things thrown at him, and people were taking pictures  of them and pointing and being like, we don't want your kind here in this park.  We don't want your conservative type of...  You know what?  He's probably right about what he's saying right now.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're getting in his face and saying, you know, you're a racist.  You're not about diversity. 
[01:44:00]  And diversity?  What?  If this is diversity, go fuck your mother.  I hate diversity, by the way.  I am such a separatist.  It's crazy.  It's become a dirty word because it's forced phony diversity.  Yes.  Real diversity is a great idea.  Right.  And it's needed.  But it's become...  You can't force people to think that way.  But the words that should be nice, like, what's the number?  Diversity, all-inclusive.  These are nice things.  But the liberals, to me, or whoever's done it, have made them so enraging. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  And they fall back on it.  And it's become an excuse for doing things that you don't want done.  For everything.  Automatic acceptance.  And something to be punishable if you don't follow it or agree with it.  Right.  And you don't have to accept somebody just because they're different.  You can hate somebody that's different than you and not be against diversity or not be a racist. 
[01:45:00]  You just...  Why can't you hate them as a human being?  It's like, I hate the person you are.  I don't hate you for your skin color or for fucking, you know, your religious background or sexual orientation.  Imagine, you're just a fucking asshole and I hate you.  But no, it's always got to be, well, you're not into diversity.  No, I'm not into assholes.  Thank you.  So there are people in that park thinking he's just an asshole.  Right, Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There are that, well, there's that. 
[01:45:30]  But I could see him taking a lot of shit for his beliefs.  And I see some of his beliefs as being a little kooky, but there's no excuse for these liberal shitheads that think they're so fucking progressive and hip and on the cutting edge of what's diversity and the melting pot and all that.  And then they're just pointing in his face, calling him a fucking, you know, ready to burn him at the stake.  It's like, well, then you're doing the exact same thing that they believe they're fighting. 
[01:46:00]  But I think he's spinning it, though.  I don't think the people that attacked him are into diversity.  They're just for the other side.  No, they're fucking racists.  They're assholes.  Yeah, they're just as bad as he is.  They were just the other side of this whole thing.  He's kind of tricking people by throwing the word diversity in there.  I think the people that did whatever they did to him, because I haven't heard this clip yet, don't have an open mind about diversity.  They're just the other side. 
[01:46:30]  That's all this was.  Let's hear the clip.  They didn't find any irony in the fact that they were yelling at me about diversity while they were trying to silence diversity of opinion.  My daughter said to me last night, because she wrote to my wife, apologizing.  It was as vague as I could make it. 
[01:47:00]  I really didn't think it would be like that.  And Tanya comes in, and she said, you need to call Hannah.  I think she's really upset.  And I called my daughter, and I said, honey, it's not your fault.  It's not your fault.  You didn't know.  And she said, I just wanted you to have a good time. 
[01:47:30]  And I said, Hannah, I couldn't.  There's a spooks there.  Would that be great?  Oh, God.  He just totally unloads.  Yeah.  They're colored.  The colored are going to be there, and I don't like being around the colored.  What an overdramatic asshole.  He is so overdramatic.  It's a dumb Hitchcock movie.  Yeah.  And she said, I'm sorry. 
[01:48:00]  I didn't realize there was only one water fountain.  Yes.  I'm used to two.  Then she came to the blanket and said, Dad, this is my boyfriend, Shaquem.  And he handed me, he handed me his CD. 
[01:48:30]  It was signed to me.  I still have five bucks.  She was walking with a limp.  He caved it in.  I caved it.  I remember the days when she used to wear little pink socks on her feet. 
[01:49:00]  Now her pink sock hangs to her feet.  It was hanging out of the back of her pants.  Like one of Dr. Octopus's arms.  Wow.  That's some damage.  It looked just like when we went to the safari at Great Adventure and drove through and a baboon sat on our windshield. 
[01:49:30]  She had KFC grease on her face.  She had blood on her shorts and grape soda spilled on the front of her chin.  He said, Daddy, I didn't know these motherfuckers was going to act like this and shit. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, God.  What a tool.  Oh, she left.  She said, peace out.  And then we went to fold up the blanket to leave. 
[01:50:30]  And I saw little, tiny, curly hairs all over it.  I like the kind you see in the sink at work that gross you out.  Negro hair.  Oh, God.  And it was right over a little prince of her asshole.  Oh, God.  Oh, there was a dent in the towel. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, God.  I sound like Ted Shackley when I cry.  Oh, shit.  Let's go back to this point.  One back.  I told my daughter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I said, honey, it's not your fault.  It's not your fault.  You didn't know.  And she said, I just wanted you to have a good time.  And I said, I was with you.  I did.  Oh, he said. 
[01:51:30]  I did.  He did.  He was with her.  Mm-hmm.  And what happened?  I said, we have to find a way to love people like that.  What?  And my daughter, who is trying just to stay normal and doesn't understand, even though  she's old enough, she refuses to believe that people are really this hateful.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Because she sees me unlike what I guess most people see me like. 
[01:52:00]  She sees me as a person.  And she knows that I don't hate Van Jones.  She hears every night I pray for the president and his safety.  Hold on.  Keep going.  God.  God.  This is why he's leaving Fox.  Does he pray out loud?  Who does that?  Yeah.  She actually hears him praying for Obama.  Dear God.  And please let the president...  How old is he?  Six? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  What else does he pray for?  A new fire truck?  What's the matter with this guy?  And then when I put a tooth under my pillow and wait for the tooth fairy.  What a fucking...  What a boring household.  And the tooth person of questionable preference, you know, you don't have to apologize.  Yes.  Yes.  You can't say...  The tooth cuckstucker.  I'm not going to say tooth fairy.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He really is.  We have to love these people.  Do you know the hatred he has for those people? 
[01:53:00]  Of course.  I'm sorry.  Look, what are you?  A Vulcan?  Stop it.  Stop the bullshit.  You know what?  I would be like, get the fuck away from my blanket, you fucking savage.  Get away!  If people are taunting my family, I would be fucking infuriated.  I wouldn't be looking to turn the other cheek.  Fuck you.  And go, fucking liberal racist agenda. 
[01:53:30]  Hit it.  It's crazy.  It's a family.  She knows that I've made mistakes.  Sure.  But she sees me as somebody who really is just trying to do the right thing.  Sure.  And she's trying to stay normal, and she refuses to...  It's so hard.  ...see...  Trying real hard to be the shepherd.  And I thank her for that.  Yeah, you're welcome.  Yeah.  She said, Dad...  Yeah?  Uh-oh.  Stop it.  Uh-oh.  Dad, what? 
[01:54:00]  I'm telling...  Come on.  I don't know if I can...  I don't know if I can find love.  Sure you can.  And I said...  I start here.  I have this giant black cock.  All I can think of...  What is that right there?  What does that remind me of?  Hold on.  What?  That...  Just that's...  It's...  It's such a monumental non-moment.  Yes, yes.  Like, go back a little...  When he goes...  I said...  Where could she find love?  And I said...  Start here.  Right here.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  Right here. 
[01:54:30]  Start here.  It's a bad...  What does it remind you of?  Start here.  What?  It reminds you of a bad movie.  No, but I'm trying to think of something specific.  It's triggering something.  And I said...  I think it reminds me when Dice would do that character.  And that man said...  That's me.  Me.  When he would do that character.  I think that's what that reminds me of.  All right.  Okay.  Drive me a little batshit.  Once he refuses to...  See what we're turning into.  Yeah, what's that?  And I thank her for that.  Zombies. 
[01:55:00]  Do you?  She said, Dad...  You're an asshole.  Exactly.  I don't know if I can...  I don't know if I can find love.  I don't know.  And I said, start here.  She said...  Match.com.  All I can think of about the people around me all night...  Heroes.  I feel sorry for you.  Oh.  I really feel sorry for you. 
[01:55:30]  Because here you are, 25 years old.  And you are...  You are so lost.  You are so...  Can you pause there?  Can we see what she looks like?  God, she's a dick.  Let's see that.  Let's see the...  I don't see what she looks like.  25.  That's my age range.  Beck.  Daughter.  Maybe I'll take her out.  Images.  Maybe I'll take her out for a moment.  I'll buy the bitch a gift.  She looks just like...  Oh, that is Glenn Beck.  No, that's Glenn Beck.  That's...  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, is that her right there?  If that blonde is her, that's pretty...  That couldn't be.  That's Megan...  That's Megan McKinnon.  That's Megan McKinnon.  Yeah.  What do I know?  Yeah.  She's a civilian.  There's probably not pictures of her.  Yeah.  All right.  Go back to the clip.  I'm sure it wasn't that one at the bottom.  And so convinced that you are absolutely 100% right, and you are helping build a system  that is fueled by hate.  You're being used, and you don't even know it. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  And by the time you wake up, it may be too late for you to get out.  And she said, Dad, are you still talking?  You're building a system.  You're talking a lot, Dad.  Fueled.  I felt bad.  I wanted you to go see a movie that you've seen 18 times.  Yeah.  Really?  Ted Turner Classics.  Yeah.  What a shitty night out with the family.  And a bunch of guys with braided pubic hair threw fucking rocks and wine at you, and  I felt kind of cunty about it.  So I said, sorry, you were right.  My friends are shit. 
[01:57:00]  And they give me this fucking speech.  Exactly.  I'm tired of hearing you pray for Obama.  Yeah.  Stop it.  You're only on your knees because you're a foot slave, and mother is sticking her tootsies  in your mouth.  You're only there because you're servicing her calluses.  He services her feet.  He probably licks her shoes.  Service the calluses.  Kiss those calluses.  That little thingy at the bottom of the video is not moving fast enough.  When does this thing end?  It really is endless.  I keep just looking at that going, when is this going to end? 
[01:57:30]  I know.  I watched it last night, and I'm just like, Jesus Christ, it's going on forever.  What is that thingy called?  The little play line.  The talusk.  The time bar.  The talusk.  It almost sounds like it could be.  I like it.  Yeah, and the talusk was moving so slow.  Yeah, the talusk bar was broken, so we had Ottoman and son's talusk repair show up, and  they fixed it.  But it's virtual.  Exactly. 
[01:58:00]  That's why they were a waste.  It was just two blue-collar guys looking at my computer, saying, call a nerd.  By the very things you say you hate, special interests, the rich, the powerful, the global  corporations, that's who's pulling your string.  Pull this string.  And by the time you wake up and see, beware, take care, will there be an escape route for  you?  Uh-oh.  You know what this calls for? 
[01:58:30]  Pause quickly.  Blueberry's shaken.  Jimmy's shaking his blueberries into the microphone.  Sometimes when things get crazy, you just gotta shake your blueberries.  Much better.  Oh, my God.  That's better.  Someone didn't sleep last night.  I'm a little tired, but there's something about shaking blueberries before Comma Boy in  a time of crisis.  Let's move on with this fucking clip. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, a little more.  It's taking forever.  Yes.  Yes, it is taking forever.  My family and I will accept you with open arms.  My family and I and millions of other Americans will be standing there and saying, doesn't matter  what happened in the past, brother.  It doesn't matter what you thought.  Hey, brother.  It doesn't matter what you even did.  Go to Reddice Center, brother.  What matters is you're here now and you're white. 
[01:59:30]  Search for individual courage.  Search for those moments when you are truly alone and sober.  Why him?  Jesus Christ.  Search for those moments.  You should search for 1976.  Do not pile into the rage.  Exactly.  Because he's not sober.  This guy's slow on booze and enjoying a road.  He just keeps playing.  In the end, only love remains. 
[02:00:00]  Only you can prevent forest fires.  And roaches and rats.  Love and roaches survive nuclear war.  Roaches, what do they love?  Shit.  Hate.  They crawl on it.  Love.  Yeah.  I don't like messages of love.  That's the promise of America.  It's not.  That is the shining city on the hill.  What?  They hid the city of love?  Cannot.  Who wants to go there?  Will not be hid.  GBTV.  Glennbeck TV. 
[02:00:30]  GBTV.  Hey, wait a minute.  He's ripping me off.  We've got BFG TV.  I'm in a million twenty-six households.  I wonder if he's doing this because there's a lot more money to be made for him.  Subscriber base.  I'm telling you, man.  He might be ahead of the fucking curve on this one.  He's got a lot of followers.  Glenn Beck is massive, dude.  Live from the BFG television set.  Now that's just B.J.  What is he?  He's not fucking.  He's being pushed out.  He may be.  But he's big.  But he will make money.  Of course, yeah. 
[02:01:00]  That's for sure.  I've done this.  I've done.  SE Cup has a show on his.  He does speaking engagements, too, where he makes a fucking boatload of money.  Actually, a boat comes up.  That's why he hates doing the Midwest.  It's very hard.  Boats can't get there.  Be on a trailer.  He's a prairie schooner.  With the covered wagons used to be called a prairie schooner.  How did you know that?  All I know is prairie dogging.  Because that's what I get when I'm getting a massage and I have to shit. 
[02:01:30]  He just pokes his head out.  Hello.  And hides.  I have like squiggy shits.  Hello.  Just pokes out.  Dude, let me tell you something.  There's very few things funnier than Laverne and Shirley when they would just say some repulsive slug and they would just walk in and go, hello.  Hello.  That would make me laugh every time.  It still makes me laugh.  42.  Of course.  It should break.  Yeah.  It should.  When we get back, we got Sandy Kane on America's Got Talent.  Yeah.  She, uh, she.  Kenny.  She bombed. 
[02:02:00]  And, uh.  Could I have some chicken noodle soup?  I thought we had a fucking food getting dropped off up in this motherfucking today.  I don't know.  What happened with that shit?  I don't know with that.  And, uh, Hulk Hogan responds to what Linda Hogan said.  Brother.  On this show?  No.  I don't know.  She said more on this show than she did on the Today Show.  That's what I'm thinking.  But they picked up, uh, the Today Show clips.  Yeah.  Because of the video.  And passed that around to the show.  Yeah.  But she was talking that, uh, Hulk had a tiny penis and all sorts of shit on the show.  Yes.  Uh, called him Peanut.  Peanut.  Peanut.  He called himself Peanut.  And she said that her new, uh, man, that Charlie guy, has a bigger piece. 
[02:02:30]  That's a big cock.  Is that what they're passing around or no?  No.  No.  That's what they should be passing around.  And she got, she gave more details about their confrontations where, uh, she said on  our show that Hulk would pull out, you know, chunks of her hair.  Goon armor.  Goon armor.  So.  I like the goon arm.  There's no one sent this information out.  Why, yo?  Because they should shake a bitch like that.  Hulk Conan responds to Linda's accusations of abuse on Bubba the Love Sponge's radio show. 
[02:03:00]  So we'll have that clip after the break.  Yeah, they're friends.  Oh, that's right.  Blue Meanie was hilarious on Twitter yesterday.  Who?  Could he get, give me the blue, ah, we'll do it, uh, all together after the break.  But Blue Meanie, it seems like, might be a fan of our show.  He's a big fan.  I think he's dead.  What, isn't he Hulk's friend?  The Meanie?  Yeah.  Uh, I don't know if he's Hulk.  No, you're thinking of, uh, Brian Knobs from the Nasty Boys.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Sorry, sorry that I confused the time.  Sometimes Sam Roberts knows everything about wrestling, by the way.  But Blue Meanie was tweeting about us yesterday. 
[02:03:30]  He's a big fan of the show.  We'll explain next.  Stay there.  Hey, this is Bob Saget.  Hey, it's Colin Quinn.  Dean Cook.  Hey, this is Jim Florenton.  This is Louis C.K.  Hey, everybody, it's Joel McHale.  Hey, this is Howie Mandel, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  This is Here I Can Be Profane.  Avoid the word cunt.  All right.  Thank you, Howie.  Howie Mandel.  Well, he's the reason I watch America's Got Talent.  You watch that show?  I've seen an episode, uh, because I was waiting for the lovely and talented Sandy Keane. 
[02:04:00]  What's your thoughts on America's Got Talent?  Um, I, I hated it.  You don't like it?  Yeah.  Why?  I was just like, oh, God, one of these, like, ah, I don't like those do-something-get-judged  shows, you know?  Yeah.  I'm just not into it.  What about when someone comes out and surprises the hell out of you?  That's so obvious.  They know what's going to happen. 
[02:04:30]  Like, I, I hate anything that's supposed to be reality, and it's not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about Piers?  Do you like Piers as a judge?  Uh, no, I don't like him as a judge or, or a talk show host.  Not a big fan of the Piers.  He was great on our show, but I can't be bothered watching that scene on a show of his.  No.  I don't watch it.  I don't know if it does.  Don't know anybody else that does.  I think, I think he's kind of a disappointment so far, right?  Is she talking about Justin Bieber?  Um, yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, I think he's, uh, not really pulling it off like Larry King did.  I have finished with Disney Channel, but that does not mean that I want to completely disown  the fact that I do have a younger generation looking up at me, I guess.  But in a way, I feel like I've done the best I can, and, and, um, that's, that's how I  am.  If I make my family proud, if I make my fans proud, that's all that matters to me.  You know what also I think is great of you?  What?  Because Steve knows this.  I had an opportunity to date Madonna, but I didn't want to share the, uh,  Wow.  I didn't want to share the spotlight because I wanted to be the center of attention. 
[02:05:30]  For you to be friends with somebody as, as popular as that, that shows a security that  I lacked at your age.  Okay.  So she's saying they're just friends?  Who?  Right.  Her and the Biebs?  Of course.  I, I said that.  Huh?  That's silly though.  Well, what about when he's picking her up in a bikini and holding her ass?  Did you see that shot?  They've been seen smooching.  Oh my God.  It's just good for business.  Her ass is finger licking good.  If you're holding it.  They were pushed, they were pushed together by their publicists and stuff. 
[02:06:00]  Do you think so?  Yes.  What year is this?  Not that they fucking need more exposure and fame, but yeah, that's a fake relationship.  Come on.  Bieber fever.  Anyone?  Does that look like friends to you?  I know.  Look at, look at the Biebs without a shirt on, huh?  Oh God.  It looks like a fourth grade shirts and skins game in gym class.  Look at the Biebs, huh?  Yeah.  Nice and hairless.  Who told them that's a good idea? 
[02:06:30]  Take your shirt off.  Take your shirt off.  Sam, you look better without a shirt on than the Biebs.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And you look horrendous.  How come no one gives, like, the Biebs and, like, boys the shit for trying to act sexual  at that age, hairless and skinny and stupid, as they would a girl who was whoring herself  up at that age.  I don't know.  You know?  Because they were like, yeah, that's inappropriate.  But they don't think the Biebs with the shirt off is inappropriate. 
[02:07:00]  He's just sexy.  Didn't an older woman kiss the Biebs when he was a little younger?  Oh, really?  And no one had a problem with that?  Was there some kind of problem?  But if it's an older guy kissing one of these young Disney starlets, there'd be...  Oh, please.  Look at the Biebs without his shirt, huh?  His dumb sunglasses and his dumbness.  And his dumbness.  I just can't stand the Biebs.  I'm not feeling it. 
[02:07:30]  No?  No, he can't dance.  He can't act.  He can't sing.  He's huge.  It's terrible.  I guess he's listening to us as he falls asleep.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happens.  I do the same thing.  You're right, Kenny?  Kenny's got himself a busy, busy weekend coming up.  Sorry, Kenny. 
[02:08:00]  I can't sit down.  If I sit down, I get comfortable, then something happens.  That's what happens to me.  Yeah.  I understand.  Yes, I'll go fetch something.  You've got a big, busy weekend with Jimmy, don't you?  Yes.  The anti-social comedy show hosted by Jim Norton.  Seattle, Friday night, Paramount Theater, Pearl Theater, and Palms Hotel Sunday night.  Would that be in Las Vegas, Nevada?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to UFC Saturday, definitely.  And then you've got to go see some fight? 
[02:08:30]  Fight?  And you still want to do the helicopter ride?  I don't know.  Do the helicopter ride.  Are you frightened?  A little bit.  Maybe we could see the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon.  Language!  Can you do all that from a helicopter out of Vegas?  Oh, yeah.  I know you could do Hoover.  I think it'll be there in, like, seconds.  How far is the Grand Canyon?  I don't know.  Not too much farther.  A couple hundred miles.  Is that easy in a helicopter?  That's fast.  Yeah.  Pretty easy?  Yeah.  You ain't got to make no turns.  Two hundred miles in a helicopter? 
[02:09:00]  How long does that take?  It's like, what?  How fast does a helicopter go when it's going forward?  Three hours by helicopter?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's what I'm thinking, man.  I think it's a long ride.  No way.  It's three hours by car.  Yeah, stop.  Helicopter doesn't go that fast when it's going forward.  Like, heliochopter?  I don't know.  I think it's pretty fucking fast.  All right.  I think you'll be there in no time.  We got Hulk Hogan responding to the Linda Hogan stuff.  She was all over the place making lots of accusations.  She certainly was. 
[02:09:30]  And the Blue Meanie got involved.  Yeah.  Why did the Blue Meanie get involved yesterday?  Well, because you went on the air and said, oh, why is Linda Hogan late?  What, is she blowing the Blue Meanie somewhere?  She came in with blue lips.  Yeah.  And the Blue Meanie is a big fan of the show.  Yeah.  And he said to please make sure that you knew that there's no way Linda Hogan was blowing him.  Oh.  He's not into trannies.  Jim Norton, on the other hand.  Wow.  Smiley face. 
[02:10:00]  And then a smiley face for Jimmy.  He's a good boy, the Blue Meanie.  He loves his show.  Who is he?  He's a wrestler, right?  Yes, he's a wrestler.  Oh.  He doesn't like the Blue Meanie.  But why does he have to go as the Blue Meanie on Twitter?  And the the has to have two Es.  That fucks it up as far as people trying to find him.  Not anymore.  No, is he doing well?  Do you have a lot of followers?  Not anymore.  Yeah.  He should have more than 9,000.  9,000?  Let's blow up his Twitter today, people.  He's cool.  He's a fan of the show.  He's my go-to wrestler when I need a wrestler. 
[02:10:30]  He was in the Blue World Order for crying out loud.  The Blue World Order?  That's right.  What other blue names were in there?  Who else was on?  Yeah.  The other people in the Blue World Order was Big Stevie Cool and Hollywood Nova.  Stevie Cool.  Exactly.  Big Stevie Cool.  Yeah, it was Steven Richards.  He is.  Oh!  He taught me a lesson.  Yeah.  He did, actually.  Big Stevie Cool is the one that choked out Opie.  Yeah.  I stopped fucking messing with wrestlers after that. 
[02:11:00]  He fucking hurt something in my neck.  You better not count on the Blue Meanie's bad side.  Nah, Blue Meanie's cool, right?  Yes, he's very cool.  All right.  So it's the Blue Meanie.  With two Es.  T-H-E-E.  Blue Meanie.  Let's squeeze 1,000 for him today and get him over 10,000.  That would be nice.  That would be nice.  We did that for Henry Winkler yesterday.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think we gave him about 2,000 yesterday.  Not bad.  Got him over the top there.  Let's get the Blue Meanie above Henry Winkler.  Well, no.  Henry's way up there, though.  We could get 50,000 for Blue Meanie.  No, let's be conservative here.  Let's try to get him 1,000 followers today. 
[02:11:30]  All right.  New followers.  The T-H-E-E Blue Meanie on Twitter.  You know what I noticed on Twitter?  Does he want to call the show?  Yeah.  What's up, man?  On the Twitter.  I noticed Jason Alexander is on Twitter.  Now, me being a giant Seinfeld fan and George Costanza being just a great character on the show,  I started following Jason Alexander, and you realize, boy, the writing on that show was great. 
[02:12:00]  How are his tweets?  Horrible.  They're not funny.  Are they supposed to be?  Yes.  Let's go to his Twitter.  Sometimes he tries to be funny.  Oh, so he's trying to be funny?  Yeah, but he's not George Costanza.  Gotcha.  And it's very hard to, you know, differentiate that.  Let's see what he's got.  You're like, I want it to be George.  Sam, why don't you do us the favor here and read a few of these tweets. 
[02:12:30]  All right.  Green Lantern.  If you had the power, would you really make green images?  I guess lanterns must have no fear and big imaginations.  Yeah, see, that's not quite...  Signals, Jerry!  Maybe I'm delusional, but I kind of feel like I could have gotten Princess Diana.  You know, when she was dating.  I mean, come on, Charles got her. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, my God, that's horrible.  It's funny, though, and it's also timely.  See, this is all...  And I've noticed this, and I'm very upset.  I feel better about my own tweets now.  What else?  It's just not...  Is that a two-parter right there?  We got a two-parter, yeah.  All right.  This gets a little political, so...  Sure, sure.  Michelle Bachman...  I like political humor, though, Sam.  You do?  I'm a big fan of it, sure.  Okay, so you'll like this.  Yes.  Michelle Bachman is in Palin form already.  Today, she declared John Quincy Adams as a founding father. 
[02:13:30]  That's like saying, I am a civil rights leader, because I was born and alive in the 60s.  And this wants to be president?  If you don't know your country, you can't run it either.  Well, by that logic, if you don't know your humor, you shouldn't be trying to be funny on Twitter.  Yes.  Yeah, he's got a few of them.  Duds.  How many followers?  He has 43,000 followers.  He shouldn't have more than the Blue Beanie. 
[02:14:00]  43,000 disappointed followers.  Give us one more.  Maybe it was just a bad run.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hugh Hefner already has a new girlfriend.  You know, if I offered a mansion, fame, and an allowance, I could get girls, too.  It's like the facts.  It's not like...  Yeah.  It really...  It really...  It's just...  That was just facts.  It's not like a clever twist on things.  Right.  He mentioned something about somebody... 
[02:14:30]  Michael Jackson's original Thriller jacket went for a lot of money recently.  And he's like, I'm thinking about selling a pair of my socks.  Um...  Yeah.  Blago is guilty just because he's obviously guilty.  What is justice in this country coming to?  What?  Oh, and Casey, you're bad shit crazy, but you're competent, dear.  All right, so you get the...  That's cool.  Aunt Jason said the...  Aunt Jason.  ...is competent, dear. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, here's the Michael...  What happened to Summer of George!  Summer of George!  T-Bone!  Michael Jackson's Thriller jacket sells for $1.8 million.  Wow.  And his boxers went for a cool $750K.  I'm selling my socks.  Only got $144K.  I was so disappointed when I followed.  Were you laughing?  Hilt.  Hysterically.  Oh, you guys will get this one because you like the movie.  No.  My son wrote red rum and toothpaste on my mirror this morning. 
[02:15:30]  Mm-hmm.  I shouldn't be overly concerned, right?  He probably should have done something better with the second half.  Maybe.  My son wrote red rum in toothpaste on my bedroom mirror this morning.  Yeah.  I was so mad, I chopped his door down with an axe.  Yes.  Something like that.  That fits the movie.  Yeah.  I was so mad, I chased him through a hedge maze.  Yes.  And then died. 
[02:16:00]  I was so mad, I watched a bunny rabbit blow a guy in a dog costume.  I was so mad, I put an axe in Scatman's brother's chest.  How about something with the movie?  Any of those?  Anything.  I was so mad, I stole the fucking mechanisms from the snow cat.  Mechanisms.  E-Rock will like this next one.  I was so mad, I fucked an old lady from the tub.  What are you doing?  Anything but what he wrote. 
[02:16:30]  Anything but what Jason wrote.  Let's all agree we're only going to read one more.  Okay, last one, and this is right up E-Rock's alley.  Old school E-Rock.  Food?  No.  Florida?  No.  See, we still have it.  For the people out there that are wondering, we still have it.  Florida?  We still read each other's minds.  Not sure about True Blood premiere.  Lots of changes.  Almost like they said, damn, what the F do we do now? 
[02:17:00]  Remember E-Rock's old what the F's?  What the F.  Oh, can we bring back the what the F?  What the F.  I forgot all about that until right now.  I got you back, buddy.  What would he say, what the F?  Where's Travis?  Travis, what the F.  Bring back what the F with E-Rock.  Wait, do we have any of those?  Do we have an old one?  As a reference point?  God.  What did he say?  E-Rock Dewey?  Uh, I don't have the list, no.  What the F's?  Because he had a website where he had a whole section of what the F's.  What the F's, right.  Remember that? 
[02:17:30]  Then we forced him to do a new one.  For E-Rocktober.  You'll remember E-Rocktober.  E-Rock, could you continue?  Could you start up the what the F's again?  Yeah.  Sure, I can.  What the F.  Why wouldn't you say fuck?  He was trying to, you know.  Because it was terrestrial radio at the time.  But you weren't on the radio if you were on a website.  No, but it went...  Food!  All right!  Can I read one more Twitter?  Yeah.  We already agreed that we wouldn't read anymore.  But this one is a funny one.  Oh, okay.  This one was funny.  OMG facts.  A can of Diet Coke floats, while a can of regular Coke sinks. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, because Diet Coke isn't a fat ass like regular Coke.  That was from Jason Alexander?  Jason Alexander.  Guy that played fucking...  George on Seinfeld.  George stands on Seinfeld, and now he's...  Oh, gosh.  That was almost a chip, isn't it?  Oh, my God, fat.  Yeah, I know.  He kind of makes a chip look like fucking Pryor in 1973.  Go down a little bit.  He's just answering people. 
[02:18:30]  A hug.  Yeah.  That's good.  Well, don't just react.  You've got to share if you're going to...  You can...  Will somebody please tell the crows in the trees around my home to shut the F at sign pound  sign up?  What?  Is Hitchcock buried in my yard?  Is Hitchcock buried in my yard?  I get the birds reference, but why would Hitchcock being buried in the yard make birds... 
[02:19:00]  Exactly.  What's that got to do with anything?  Why don't you just say fuck?  Yeah.  Just say fuck.  Just say fuck!  It's okay.  It's freeing!  You're not on Seinfeld anymore.  You can say it.  What?  What's with the crows flying around?  Yeah.  What's with these crows?  George, those crows!  Look, I got a text from...  I'm going to just say...  He should say, what are these black crows doing in my yard?  Good thing Michael Richards isn't in my kitchen.  He had to get rid of them. 
[02:19:30]  Good, sorry.  I'm going to give credit where credit is.  Travis sent me this.  Eric, this is not my idea.  Travis sent it to me, and it's just something to throw out to you guys.  Travis is wondering...  Who's funnier?  Jason Alexander or the virus?  That's tough.  Just something Travis was asking.  That's tough.  I mean, I don't know if the virus has any soft drink material.  That's tough.  The virus.  Who's funnier?  You know what?  There wasn't one laugh in those tweets. 
[02:20:00]  How about this?  Not a one.  I don't want to do a bit with the virus, of course, but I am thinking that maybe we could  look at a Jason Alexander tweet, look at the subject, don't tell him what it is, and  say the subject is this, and see, is the virus's joke funnier than the tweet, and then read  the tweet.  Like, go down a little bit.  Okay.  Yeah.  That is good.  Like, go down.  Oh, hold on.  Okay.  No, not today.  This takes a...  It's not really a joke.  It's a long time. 
[02:20:30]  This is 30 minutes or a minute.  Oh, I know.  It's just...  Are we ready to do this?  It's just...  Wait, let's see.  Jimmy goes...  Hold on.  Hey there.  Hey, maybe that?  Let me see.  Do we have the energy for this today?  Um...  It's ponderous.  Oh.  Let's see.  This is a good one.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  That's a good one.  It's I, Jason Alexander, is his Twitter. 
[02:21:00]  He's very funny.  E-Rock, why don't you come in?  The subject is a zombie and a vampire and stuff like that.  Oh, wow.  The virus likes zombies and vampires.  Yes, he does.  That was me.  I figured that.  Ah, the virus.  Hi.  Ah, yes.  Come on.  Need the virus music?  He's on the clock. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, God.  Now, it's...  Hi, virus.  How are you today?  Hi, guys.  It's, uh...  It's, uh...  The bits about werewolves and vampires and stuff.  So you have to do a joke about them.  Some kind of funny joke.  Or just a statement about them that you think might be humorous.  And quickly.  I guess to help them along, did you hear the one about the...  Yeah.  Did you hear the one about the... 
[02:22:00]  Go.  At least say that much.  So, wait.  Okay, bang.  It doesn't even have to be a joke punchline.  It can just be an amusing thought about werewolves.  Yeah.  Like, werewolves' hands are hairy.  Does that mean they jerk off a lot?  It's not a great one, but it's attempted humor.  I hope I didn't steal your ace in the hole. 
[02:22:30]  One minute.  Come on.  Let's go, virus.  Have a thought.  What the F?  And...  Go.  Yeah, the music is inspiring.  Yeah, turn up the music a little bit.  Let's go, virus.  You might be inspired.  Just go.  Did you hear the one about the vampire?  Or the werewolves?  Did...  Did...  Did...  Sorry, peanut butter.  Of course.  That was the funniest thing I've ever heard the virus say. 
[02:23:00]  Exactly.  Did you hear the one about the werewolves and the vampires?  Yes, no.  No, we...  No, virus.  Hey, what about those vampires and the...  Whatever.  Yeah, what happened?  Go.  And here comes the funny.  Yeah.  Three, two, one.  Funny.  You're on. 
[02:23:30]  Two minutes.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  He's holding the mic with two hands.  This is good.  He's ready.  All right, start with the setup again.  He's ready.  I need more.  No, you don't.  You're trying.  Peanut butter's hurting.  What to swim in?  Another whale joke.  We got it.  The virus is killing with his improv. 
[02:24:00]  He really is.  He's improv-ing.  I like it.  His crowd work is good.  Good, virus.  You grab the microphone with two hands, you have something.  Set up and go.  Three, two, one.  Did you read that Jason Alexander Twitter about werewolves and vampires?  No.  Oh, no.  What's up?  It sucked more than a virus bit.  Oh, God.  I didn't get it.  You took the easy way out.  Improvs are good.  Self-deprecation doesn't work with the virus. 
[02:24:30]  Vampire, like, suck?  Vampire?  I don't know.  I'm not feeling it.  God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wait.  Is that...  Hold on.  Let me see if that's funnier than Jason Alexander's Twitter.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  He writes, so if a zombie bites a vampire, does it die?  And if a werewolf bites a zombie, is it a werewolf?  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  So if a zombie bites a vampire, does it die?  And if a werewolf bites a zombie, is it a were-zombie? 
[02:25:00]  True blood, walking dead.  I'm losing it.  Boo!  The winner?  Oh.  Not the listeners.  No, no.  The virus.  The virus.  The virus won that one by a hair.  All right.  You want to know what Linda Hogan's ex there said about what she was saying yesterday? 
[02:25:30]  By the way, we had a great photo bomb with Jimmy's Linda Hogan picture.  Check out Jimmy's Twitter if you want to see the photo bomb.  A lovely picture.  Yeah, you got Anthony poking his head around and then me jerking off in the very, very back.  Off in the back?  You don't notice me at first, but oh boy, you'll see.  Oh, it's classic.  If you study the picture.  Unfortunately, I was doing the jerk-off thing, but that was behind the bodies.  So you only get to see the jerk-off face.  Ah, yeah, there it is. 
[02:26:00]  Jerk-off face.  Jerk-off.  A jerk-off face.  So I'm right over Jimmy's shoulder.  Where's he not going with his lunch?  He's got his backpack with him.  Where is he going?  I don't know.  By the bathroom.  Would you?  Would you?  No.  Why not?  Jimmy, you would.  Yeah, I would.  No, she's one of these bleached blonde, had work done.  She's wearing, I think Pat Fominaki said it. 
[02:26:30]  She's wearing a Century 21 real estate agent gown.  How would he know what one of those looks like?  Solving my trailer.  Cost me an arm and a toe.  You didn't find her attractive at all?  No.  That is the furthest thing from my type in the world.  Sammy Hagar.  Yeah.  Can you find an older woman attractive?  Not like that.  No.  It'd have to be more...  Can you find a 40-some-odd-year-old woman attractive?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:27:00]  Do you have one in mind?  No problem with that.  Like Jennifer Aniston in Horrible Bosses.  Wait till you see what she looks like.  Yeah, yeah.  See someone like that.  Holy shit.  And she's, I think, 42 now.  Yeah.  Somewhere around there.  A little Shawnee.  A little Shawnee Smith.  How old is she?  40.  She's 40.  Wow, she's 40?  Yeah.  She's doing something right.  Yeah.  I would have never put her at 40.  Shit like that, you know.  All right.  Fair enough.  That shit's fine.  But I don't like that over the top.  She looked like every fucking bitch that tried to sell me a house. 
[02:27:30]  I want to keep bringing up the real estate agent angle, but she looks like an old real  estate agent.  She should be doing 80 miles an hour in a Cadillac in front of me with me yelling, slow  down.  I don't know where the house is.  She does.  Yeah.  She just looks like, you know what she looks like?  She, she not looks like, but reminds me of Dean Warmer's wife from fucking Animal House.  She was dripping, um, a sexual vibe yesterday. 
[02:28:00]  I don't know what it was about.  You sure it wasn't a vaginal mesh problem?  Oh, yeah.  You're just watching the stupid Casey Anthony trial.  All I see are those commercials.  Have you had a vaginal mesh that has resulted in prolapse?  What the fuck is that?  Pain during intercourse.  It's like a thing that they use if, if you're a woman and you're old and your pussy starts  falling out.  That's what you do to keep your, your, your hairs out of the food.  If you're a, your pussy's making lunch in a high school vaginal mesh. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  That was a, you're going to go with that.  That was a joke mesh.  I made a mesh of the joke.  You made a mesh of your crackers.  Give that one to Jason Alexander.  He could tweet that.  Yeah, yeah, Jason.  He would like that one.  Jason could tweet that one.  P asterisk exclamation point S Y.  Right.  So Hulk Hogan responded to Linda's accusations of abuse on Bubba the Love Sponges radio show.  So here we go.  It's just, it's just delusional.  I mean, the stuff she said about me is a total blatant lie. 
[02:29:00]  I, dude, I never laid a hand on her.  Why do you think that you slept?  It's a total, it's a total blatant lie.  First off, you know, there's no reason.  I mean, she's a non-issue and I hate to be mean, but I really have to take a step back  and take a really good look at this.  And, you know, if you take the Hulk Hogan name out of her situation, her life, her career,  the air she breathes, I mean, she's out of gas.  She's still riding on the Hulk Hogan name. 
[02:29:30]  Just take her and put her in the same category with the Iron Sheep and the Ultimate Warrior.  They all belong together.  Having someone tell you to go F yourself is hard to take.  I mean, when I say every single day on a consistent basis, I'm not joking.  And when I say I'm leaving you and I'm getting divorced, I'm going to go find someone else.  I'm going to find somebody younger.  I mean, that wasn't just a one-time thing.  That was the normal rhetoric that happened on a consistent basis.  And I just didn't realize how far down I was beat up. 
[02:30:00]  What do you think, man?  I mean, she came across believable yesterday.  We don't really know her.  We don't know Hulk.  We don't know the players.  But, man, she absolutely came across believable.  I got no idea.  Yeah, I have no idea.  I got no idea.  What do you think?  I think he's probably lying more.  Because, again, being Hulk, it's so much easier to go out and get pussy.  And I believe that he was probably a lot more likely to cheat just because the opportunities when you're Hulk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would say the Hulkster, in my opinion, based on hearing both sides of the story, I have rendered an opinion. 
[02:30:30]  I believe Linda McMahon is telling the truth here.  Linda Hogan.  Yes, Linda McMahon is telling the truth.  And Hulkster may have been stepping out, as they say, stepping out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then she's scorned, and then maybe she exaggerates some things.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  I'm sure she was cunty.  You know, in a divorce, people say things they can never take back.  You know?  You rotten, filthy fuck cunt. 
[02:31:00]  That's one thing.  It's hard to take back.  But that's not even bad, dude.  You probably don't even want to take it back.  Those are just words.  My girlfriend would get mad at me when I'd say stuff like that to her.  Like, I hate you.  Yeah.  But it was like, that's retractable.  Yeah.  I hate you as general.  How about personal things?  Like, yeah.  Or if you talk about intimate things that are hers.  But if you say to somebody, I hate you, you're a piece of shit.  Those are interchangeable with any person. 
[02:31:30]  That's one thing.  We would say something like, and your fucking vagina's crooked.  Exactly.  Right.  Now that's something she's going to be like, I know it is.  And he brought it up.  And oh, boy.  Or if, by the way, you're writing, it fucking stinks.  Oh, something personal.  If she wants to write.  Exactly.  Take something she's passionate about.  Yes.  And shit all over it.  Then it cannot be retracted.  Yes.  You're a fucking piece of shit.  You're a cunt or an asshole.  Just dumb words.  Yeah.  I hate you.  It's like, come on.  That's generic.  I'm telling you, that's generic.  It doesn't mean anything.  Well, let me see how Casey's looking today.  Oh, that's nice. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  She looks like Matt Dillon is fucking my bodyguard.  He wasn't in that.  More eye makeup on.  What's she talking?  What is that?  She looks like Matt Dillon.  Speaks out as defense argues for a mistrial.  What'd she say?  I killed my baby.  I killed my baby.  Oops.  That slipped out.  I don't like her ears.  Huh?  They're adorable.  They're like little wood elf ears.  She's got to cover them.  She looks like she belongs in the Lord of the Rings.  The ears are pointy.  Well, they pull her hair back like that so she doesn't have long flowing black hair because 
[02:32:30]  the jury sees that as a whore-ish as they parade up boyfriend after boyfriend that she's  fucked.  So.  Hey, man, we'd love to have the Hulk on our show.  He could talk about it.  I'm not coming back, brother.  He never was on our show.  He was on our show.  A live thing we did at the Hard Rock.  Oh, yeah.  I guess technically it was on the show.  Yeah.  When they were all one big happy family.  I got that picture.  Yeah, remember that?  If you want to go back to it, Travis found two examples of Eric doing what the F. 
[02:33:00]  And we're bringing back what the F with E-Rock, right?  What the F.  Can we hear an example of this?  What the F is with public restrooms.  You're in the stall and you notice that there is a one foot gap from the floor to the door.  Not to mention the two inch gap from the door's edges to the walls.  Why not just remove it all together and let everyone see what I'm doing?  Like I'm in effing prison.  It will also save me the time kicking the three-year-old in the head who keeps peeking under the door to see what's going on while he's in the same booth with his dad who's taking a leak. 
[02:33:30]  I'm not his father.  Uncle Paul.  What did he say?  He said, just leave the doors off like I'm in prison.  Can we hear the prison?  Just leave the doors off like I'm in prison.  I should have just kept it as it was because you did all of that in the original. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, I did!  Oh, and why wouldn't I have repeat the same shit I do over and over again?  No, it's a testament to the fact you caught it twice.  Let's hear it again.  What the F is with public restrooms.  You're in the stall and you notice that there is a one-foot gap from the floor to the door.  Not to mention the two-inch gap from the door's edges to the walls.  Why not just remove it all together and let everyone see what I'm doing? 
[02:34:30]  Like I'm in effing prison.  Effing prison!  Oh no, Brutus gives fuckskin me ass coal!  I bet it takes me spinach and put it up me bungs coal so he can't get skis cockskin there!  Oh my gosh! 
[02:35:00]  The sisters wants to fucksk me in the showers!  I'm in prison!  Prising!  Just take the pesky doors off the stalls!  I don't need that skis, I want him to see my penis skis, I got a tattoo skis of an anchor on it skis.  Think he rocks an idiot?  We rocks a dolt.  Like I'm in prison.  Wow, alright.  We're bringing back what the F. 
[02:35:30]  I'm in prison.  Here's an old example of what the F with Eric.  Continue.  What the F is with collect calling.  Do rock stars usually, no sorry, do rock stars really use 1-800-COLLECT when calling home?  According to the commercials, they do.  You would think they would have enough money for a payphone or a cell phone, wouldn't you?  Or, oh wait, I lost it.  You would think they would have enough money for a payphone, wouldn't you?  Something you never said about weight.  Hell, those have, thanks. 
[02:36:00]  Hell, those have free long distance nights and weekends.  Yourself?  What the F?  That was weird.  He just thanked in a tape.  He thanked you in a tape for insulting him.  He probably knew there was a fat joke head in his way.  Oh, it had to be.  He's got a lot of blabar.  I got the picture of Casey Anthony for you.  Oh, is that?  That's Bat Boy!  Oh.  That's Bat Boy from the Weekly World News.  It's not Casey Anthony.  Oh, I got confused. 
[02:36:30]  Bat Boy.  Just put hair on Bat Boy.  It's Casey Anthony.  Especially, even with the eyes, the psycho eyes.  Is the What the F continue, or is that it?  No, that's all that Eric read that day.  Eric too?  That's funny.  Yeah, because you guys kind of read like 50 of them.  What the F?  What the F, Iraq?  Can he do one for tomorrow?  Can Eric do one for tomorrow?  Yeah.  Of course he can.  I don't think he's in there, right?  Oh, he's not in there?  No, but he'll do one.  Where'd he go?  He's in the back.  He's got a lot of frustrations. 
[02:37:00]  What, does he?  Yeah.  Sandy Cain on America's Got Talent?  Yeah.  Oh, so you don't like America's Got Talent?  Nah, not my cup of tea, as they say.  I kind of like it.  I don't like the...  I like documentaries.  I don't like the early rounds as much, but I like it.  I was watching another one of those fucking goddamn airline shows.  They show how a plane crashed and then go through all the fucking problems.  What flight?  Oh, God.  It was an old one from, I think, the early 70s, DC-10. 
[02:37:30]  Of course.  I know.  Fucking guys had this weather computer, and apparently if the weather is really fucking heavy, it throws back a bad signal.  And they thought they had an opening through these thunderheads, but it was just complete.  The sky was full.  Worst storm that a plane has ever flown into.  They had literal softball-sized hail cracking the windshield.  Jesus.  Bashing the plane's surface and then flying into the engines.  Wait, couldn't they just... 
[02:38:00]  At that point, is that just not wanting to admit...  Couldn't they just turn around and come back?  Yeah, you would think.  Like, literally, you're in for another minute and then you're out.  But they were depending on their radar so much that they saw openings in the clouds and were like,  we'll just fly through these openings.  But the openings can be a misinterpretation of the worst parts of the storm not reflecting the radar back.  It's actually dispersing it because there's so much shit going on in there that it looks like a nice corridor for your plane.  And nowadays, they have much better shit.  What airline do you remember? 
[02:38:30]  Sunjet or something.  It was an old one.  It was an old one.  And some people lived.  But both their engines petered out.  They lost both engines.  And then they're trying to start the engines.  And you're watching going, you know, I wonder if they get one engine started.  And then you realize, like, at the end there was no chance of them starting the engines.  They got something in the engine where it goes through the first turbo fan.  And when it goes through the second smaller compressor that's supposed to fire it out the back, light it, and then boom, get that? 
[02:39:00]  They had this weird back flow going.  And it ripped the turbine blades right off the turbines.  So those engines were just gone.  Are both engines did that?  Yeah, both engines.  And they had enough altitude where they were trying to get to an airport.  They made a steep turn.  Then they fucked up and made an S-turn and lost the room they would have needed to make the airport.  Why'd they make an S-turn?  To try to get out of the storm, out of the storm's way.  But they didn't have to. 
[02:39:30]  They could have gone straight.  And then they go, we're landing on a road.  So they picked this highway.  They started landing on it and hit a car.  Pew, overturned, cartwheeled, hit a gas station.  I mean, everything that went wrong.  Flames, burning people.  But a few people walked away from it.  Walked away from it and were able to tell what happened.  But they did actually, they were able to land if they had just found a place to land.  A better place to land, yeah.  It's not the road.  An airport.  They had nothing.  And then they realized they did have an airport they could have made.  But the air traffic controller didn't see it. 
[02:40:00]  It wasn't on its radar or something.  It was back, you know, years ago.  With every one of these crash shows I watch, they learn, like, so many things that they've implemented.  And that's why, I guess, you know, knock wood, air crash deaths have plummeted.  Yeah.  You don't have to knock wood.  I'm flying tomorrow.  I dare you, God.  My plane ain't coming down.  Oh, Jesus.  It's an impossibility that my plane's coming down.  Oh, jeez.  No.  No way is my plane going down.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm flying safe. 
[02:40:30]  Nice flight to Seattle, then Vegas, then home.  That's the whole country.  Boom, dude.  You fly the whole country.  I know you laugh.  I dare God to do something.  Oh, boy, you're crazy.  Me?  I dare you to fuck with that plane.  Oh, God.  I dare you.  God, I'm praying for our President Obama to be healthy.  Because I'm like Glenn Beck.  Sure.  And I pray that you let this prayer override Jimmy's prayer.  Yeah?  Pray, my asshole.  I say, go ahead, knock the plane out of the sky. 
[02:41:00]  I'll laugh at you.  I'll say, what up to the devil?  Oh, God.  God takes care of drunks and fools.  Kidding.  Of course, God.  Of course, God.  Please, that was a joke.  I'm kidding.  Does God listen?  No, you think God listens to this show?  He probably has a new fucking car.  He can't get it.  Drives a fucking Audi.  What channels are we on?  Who fucking knows?  For the 200s and then one something.  It's just a mess.  I still don't have it in my car.  We're on 105 and 206. 
[02:41:30]  How do I get it back in my car?  Do you have to call Gary Ledbetter?  And then he did it for me when I was driving.  Do you have the premium package?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  I really don't know.  You call him.  You turn your radio on.  You hit a little button.  It gives you your number.  My car is like 10 stories below ground right now.  Well, you've got to pull it out.  And then what?  Where are you, parking?  While you're driving, next time you're going to Philly, call him.  And while your radio is on, put it on a channel you like.  Call Gary and say, here's my number.  And then he will do-do-loop into the computer. 
[02:42:00]  And 15 minutes later, you should have your channels.  It was very easy.  Do-do-loop?  Did it make that sound?  No, he does.  That's what he says instead of goodbye.  Oh, okay.  Gary says, do-do-loop.  It's very uncomfortable in corporate situations.  Yes.  All right, listen.  I want him fired.  Do-do-loop.  All right, so you don't have to like America's Got Talent to know that one of our, I don't  know.  Where's Sandy King in us these days?  I don't know.  One of our people with a giant pussy wart.  Associate with fucking gravity-riddled tits.  That's why.  We haven't done enough for her or something. 
[02:42:30]  I saw her the other day in Times Square, and she-  Was she nice to you?  She was very nice.  She was like, Anthony, oh my God, it's great.  I could go to Times Square.  It's all because of you guys.  She's crazy.  And then she's like, give me a hug.  I go, don't even touch me.  And a bunch of people in Times Square started laughing.  They thought it was a skit.  So I put out my hat and got money, and then I picked some pockets and sold some CDs to  some Rubes, and I played a spackle bucket for like an hour and a half and made some  money.  I guess you-  You don't like that either? 
[02:43:00]  Shut up!  No?  Set up a drum set.  Found a guy in Central Park with a piano.  You can't get a drum set to fucking-  They got bongos.  They brought the bongos.  Yeah.  She just tweeted, Opie and Anthony are talking about me again.  Proof I made them what they are today.  Without me, they're nothing.  My suspicion is that that's not really her.  Yeah.  I can't see her tweeting.  Because she tweets, and I thought it was her for a while, because she also Facebooks.  Does she have a real Twitter?  I don't know, but-  She has a Twatter account.  A Twatter.  See? 
[02:43:30]  Because of Twatter.  Whoever's doing that tweets at times where she would probably be in Times Square.  Not like now, but like on a sunny afternoon when I'm getting tweetbacks from her.  Sounds nice.  That would imply that she's at home.  Well, someone's misrepresenting her then.  That's what I think.  That's my theory.  You want to just play the video, Sam, so we got the visual?  Might as well.  As long as it's the same length.  As long as this isn't just a highlight or something.  Yeah, let's try it.  So, she was on America's Got Talent yesterday.  Good for her.  What do you want from me?  Is it?  Hit it.  It's my boyfriend, and I'm writing him this song. 
[02:44:00]  I'm writing him this song to tell him some.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He's sweeter than ice cream.  On a stick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He is the ice cream I love to lick.  I love Nick. 
[02:44:30]  I love Nick.  Give me a big hug, Sam.  Oh, boy.  You don't want to do that, Nick.  I want to be checked now.  I love Nick.  He's Nick in the house.  In the house.  I hope Sandy know I'm married.  I want to hear what the judges said.  Yeah, that was the highlight.  She's big.  She was actually walking around with the newspaper that had the little clip that said she was  going to be on the show.  Oh, really? 
[02:45:00]  She's like, look, look, look at this.  I'm going to be on the show.  She made one of her awful non-Photoshops where she pasted pictures together in Xerox.  And then Xeroxes it.  I love those.  And it was like a picture of Nick Cannon and then a picture of her obviously taped next  to it.  Yeah.  She had made Xerox copies of it.  She was handing out in Times Square.  Oh, we're going to have to replay this because the judges get involved.  It's a longer clip.  Oh, that's why she said Nick because it can't.  I know that makes more sense.  She was just redoing her dick song.  Yeah.  That's her dick song.  Yeah.  Except she wasn't playing guitar with it.  She had like that backing track. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How'd that happen?  How'd they get the backing track to I Love Dick?  I don't know.  Did someone have to arrange it?  Karaoke version.  Orchestra?  Yeah.  The show band had to like learn the song.  Learn I Love Dick?  For her appearance.  Shit, man.  Sometimes things can get a little too personal.  Nick is my boyfriend and I'm writing him a song.  I'm writing him a song.  He's telling the song.  I love Nick. 
[02:46:00]  I love Nick.  He's sweeter than ice cream on a stick.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  He is the ice cream I love to lick.  Nick is candy.  He can't be my heart.  I love Nick.  I love Nick.  Give me a big hug.  Yes, baby.  I love Nick.  He's Nick in the house. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, Sandy, no, I'm married.  I'm thrilled that you love Nick.  And not me.  I'm going to vote no.  Okay.  Sharon?  Okay.  It has to be a no from me.  Okay.  It's three no's, I'm afraid.  All right.  Nick awaits.  All right.  All right.  All right.  She might have got a better score to tell her first step of rape story.  Thank you for professing your love for me. 
[02:47:00]  Okay, baby.  It's a bit I lost.  No, don't worry about that.  I want to go to Vegas.  What is she thinking?  Oh, my goodness, man.  How's happening back there?  You still love me, Sandy?  No.  I'm married anyway.  So as a broken heart turns to a broken dream, the judges find themselves confronted with  some truly unusual acts.  I like what she accuses people of being gay for not being attracted to.  Yeah.  What are you gay? 
[02:47:30]  What are you gay?  Wait, that's not live or it is live?  The auditions are not live.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  No.  Because she probably sang I Love Dick so many times and they were like, no, Sandy.  You know the producer just fed her I Love Nick.  Yeah, yeah.  It wasn't her idea.  Yeah, of course not.  Why not?  Just say his name is Richard.  I do a song.  It's called I Love Dick.  I Love Dick.  I don't think I can do it.  I Love Dick.  I Love Dick.  Could you say Nick?  Sure, I'll do anything.  Nick has a dick.  What?  Yeah.  Is it like a fat?  Is he fucking fat? 
[02:48:00]  She's all fat.  I'll suck it.  What, are you gay?  Yeah, man.  You've had a lot of spooks rate me, man.  You should probably rate me.  Flip Wilson rate me.  Chuck rate me once.  Got it in his sleep again.  Then he bought me a fruit salad.  I have a big thing on my pussy.  I sound like Bobcat Goldthwait.  That's a good impression.  I love Nick.  Good for her, right? 
[02:48:30]  Good for her.  That'll help her Times Square much.  I guarantee you she has her shitty blue wig from the show on today.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's been wearing it in Times Square.  Yeah, yeah.  She wants to be known now.  She sees that as her ticket.  The naked cowgirl from America's Got Talent.  Yeah.  She'll be selling that for a while.  And she is, like, literally, I didn't know.  She's, like, just a few yards from the naked cowboy.  Oh, yeah.  Like, they're really close together.  Like, he's got to look and go, just fucking piece of shit. 
[02:49:00]  They're across the street from each other.  How did he fucking lose that lawsuit?  No.  Good for her, man.  I blew the judge.  I talked to her.  He wasn't a fake.  She said that the judge saw that there is an obvious difference between boy and girl.  And that is right there.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but it's like, I can't do a show called The Barty Bunch.  You probably could.  Probably could.  Maybe.  Yeah.  The Golden Guys.  That's exact.  Old Guys. 
[02:49:30]  Guys and girls are different.  You want to ask?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  I'm just an entrepreneur.  I like when she starts asking people if they're Jewish, too.  What are you, Jewish?  Jewish.  Why, so I don't tip her?  She just asks him.  When she's a loss for words.  I'm a Jew.  Yeah.  Like, it's setups, but they don't go anywhere.  Two Jews walk into a bar.  And?  Nothing.  And then no joke.  What, are you gay?  Yeah, you gay?  You're thirsty.  You're gay.  What are you, gay? 
[02:50:00]  I'm not gay.  Okay.  Oh, he's been on hold all day.  For what?  He's still trying to figure out if I'm going to that meds game.  What was I reading?  And then I heard he might have got better tickets.  If I go, I'm going to the original seats.  I heard he has like six tickets now.  Oh, really?  I'm not sure.  All right, then I don't have to go.  No, but now he wants all of us to go.  Are we all gone?  I'll go.  You want to all go?  I'll go.  What day?  Is he there?  16th, I think. 
[02:50:30]  Now he's gone.  Oh, okay.  We're finally going to go to him and now he's gone.  He hangs up.  What day do you want to go?  It was B-WB.  I don't know when the game is, where the tickets are, how many there are.  Hey, when are we doing the Chair of Honor again on the couch of Zilch's?  Oh, yeah.  It would have to be next Friday.  Next Friday?  We'll be the next one?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, the Chair of Honor is booked until December.  There may be a couple of openings, but...  Oh, really?  Yeah, for really special things. 
[02:51:00]  I hope that played well out there, because I love the whole Chair of Honor and Couch of  Zilch's thing.  Just for really special things.  That means we could get four people on the Couch of Zilch's and one in the Chair of Honor.  They'd have to stand while we were deciding who goes where.  Absolutely.  Well, we understand that.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  At least one of them.  We should have a standing room only area, too.  Yes, we do.  It's right over there.  Or the garbage can.  They can stand by the garbage can and the garbage can and TVs.  We're going to have spots all over this studio within a moment. 
[02:51:30]  It's not a big studio.  Well, no one has mentioned that we needed a bigger one.  It's the first time.  What are they...  Yeah.  And we'll have some obstruction seats.  Obstructed view?  Obstructed view.  Obstructed view.  Which means on the console, which means you get to only see our lower halves.  Obstructed view.  They can stand behind the TVs behind Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah, behind the TV.  Can we do obstructed view seats?  Yeah.  That would suck.  Yeah, they got to stand in the corner?  It's fucked. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, man.  Yeah, right.  Sandy Kane should get obstructed view seats.  Yeah, that's how she'd do it.  Are you queer?  You would be gay or something.  Fuck you.  You got hair like a smooch.  She's still very pissed about the guitar being broken, by the way.  I fucking gave her...  I'll break down a wall.  I fucking gave her way too much money for that thing.  Eight dollars.  Yeah, really.  She made out on that deal.  Yeah.  But she still plays the broken one, right?  Yes.  Jesus.  It's got bumper stickers over the hole. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, is she a dummy?  That cost me a lot, that fucking game.  Ah, yes, Dr. Michiukaku.  I saw him walking home yesterday.  He doesn't want anything to do with me.  I'm wearing Colonel Sanders' suit.  He doesn't recognize you.  He doesn't recognize me, and I'm fucking in this building.  Hi, Dr. Kaku.  Oh, you're assaulting me.  No.  Hi.  I've known you for fucking five years.  I've been saying hi to you.  You're assaulting me.  You're on the radio show next to me.  Hi.  Hi, Dr. Kaku. 
[02:53:00]  Don't take my money.  Hey, social misfit, you've been seeing me on the elevator for four years.  All right, I thought it was me.  I feel better.  Jesus Christ.  I say hi to the guy all the time, and not only does he not say hi back, he does start  walking faster.  Yeah, he's afraid of people.  But he's this brilliant mind, and he can't recognize somebody.  Jimmy's right.  He sits maybe two feet in front of Jimmy.  You sat next to me in a social medium outlet. 
[02:53:30]  You know what he's had for breakfast.  You can smell it on his breath.  He's so close.  Hi, Dr. Kaku.  Hello.  Hey, Opie and Antony.  And then fucking ten minutes later in the lobby.  Hi.  Hi.  Why are you hitting me with brick?  I'm saying hi.  Quit the brick.  I don't understand that either.  I'm so glad it's not me.  I guess he's talking about that.  Oh, my God.  Because I tried again yesterday.  I see him and his wife on the elevator with the kid, and I hold the door high, and his  wife is very nice.  Thank you. 
[02:54:00]  Let's take another elevator.  He gets all scared.  He cowers out like I'm a fucking monster.  What are you doing?  He's a nervous guy.  He's a panicky Pete who recognizes nobody.  Oh, God.  That's funny.  And he drinks lactate.  Does he?  Yeah.  We found that out at Jubilee.  But I would never say hi to him at Jubilee.  Hi, Howard.  Oh, apples.  Are you from the apple farm?  Are you following me?  Little cookie people.  No, I'm saying hi.  Like I have been for four years. 
[02:54:30]  And you talk about the universe with the guy.  Wow.  He's all in.  Not in person.  He's not.  So how does gravity form?  Oh, heavy things.  And he runs down the hall.  Sick of him.  I told you that you probably shouldn't look up to a guy like that.  Wow.  You get what you deserve.  That's what you get.  He's a social phobe.  Phobe.  And Bat Boy's on Fox News right now.  Look up.  That's not Bat Boy.  Bat Boy.  That's not.  That's Casey Anthony. 
[02:55:00]  That's Bat Boy with mascara.  I like that she's got some tendrils coming down in front of her ears.  And the ponytail's a little nicer today.  She doesn't have that real hardened criminal look.  It's Amy Fisher's husband right now.  No, no.  George Pappard.  It's George Anthony, the father.  Oh, oh.  He looks like...  That was too inside.  Sorry.  Fuck it.  Leslie Nielsen.  I got about it.  It looks like...  Do you deny fingering your daughter's asshole?  I do.  Wow. 
[02:55:30]  He came up with a story yesterday that he might have...  He might have?  No.  He might have been having a little fun with some associate, some girl that was helping look.  One of the search party.  But he said, it's ridiculous.  No.  It's like, well, you went over to her house.  Went over to her apartment.  My granddaughter was missing.  I needed cum taken out of my balls.  What would you do if your granddaughter was missing?  Keep all the cum in your balls?  No.  You get rid of it so you can look better.  Because you get distracted. 
[02:56:00]  You're looking for little shoes, but you can't think of that.  You just keep thinking about the cum in your balls until some volunteer drains it into  her mouth-cutting asshole.  For Pete's sake.  What, am I irrational?  Hello, Dr. Kaku.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  Very frightened.  All right.  So you've experienced this.  I hate him.  You guys live in the same building.  For years.  Hi.  Hi.  That's the only reason he started doing our show, because you used to take elevator rides.  I would take elevator rides.  I said, let's try to get him on. 
[02:56:30]  We got him on.  Oppie and Ante.  And he doesn't even know you live in his building.  No.  I've seen this fuck 50 times and said hi to him.  No more hi's.  I'm just going to look at him.  Go ahead.  Say something about the universe.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh.  I can't.  Next time I see him, I'm going to say, look, I'm sorry about that problem at the  Halderon Collider.  Hi.  Oh.  Good.  Close doors.  Make a phone call.  I'm going to say things that he has to investigate. 
[02:57:00]  You believe they found out what the dark matter was?  Close doors.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Cookie people.  Oh.  Light bulb ears.  What?  What are you talking about?  He's had it, huh?  Had it with him.  Had it.  My niceness goes nowhere.  I live in the building.  Hi.  How are you?  Huh?  I sold the family away.  What do you think I'm going to do?  Oh.  Is that classic?  Huh?  Fucking social phobe.  He really is.  I have Asperger's. 
[02:57:30]  Two billion times the square root of 51.  I know the answer to that.  How are you?  Ah!  Help!  Stop assaulting me with friendly gestures.  The cookie people are going to get me.  If you have, if you look into a fish tank, we're not near a fish tank.  I want to know the answer.  I'm just trying to say hello.  Hello!  We live in the same building. 
[02:58:00]  We see each other.  Get him on the phone.  He's in between TV interviews.  What is he talking about these days?  The wildfires?  The wildfire by the Los Alamos nuclear power plant.  Well, it's by the nuke plant.  Oh, of course it is.  It's by the nuke research facility.  So, Dr. Kaku, what can you tell us about these fires?  Well, if two elves rub magic sticks together and a fire starts, the universe...  No, it won't! 
[02:58:30]  Good morning, Dr. Kaku.  Ah!  Get me something to hide behind!  I'm frightened of your gesture of friendliness.  I hate salutations!  Oh, man!  When you take the square root of something and you multiply it by four billion, you get that,  and then we have string theory, which believes that there are little vibrating strings that make everything happen. 
[02:59:00]  That's fantastic.  Yes, the universe could be bubbles and bubbles upon bubbles.  We don't know.  You know, just for the hell of it, I haven't...  How are you feeling today?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Get away!  Ah!  I'm going for coffee.  Would you like...  Ah!  What?  Coffee, though!  It would burn!  Ah!  Who are you?  I've never seen you before 50 times.  I've never seen you before 50 times. 
[02:59:30]  I have never seen you a lot in this building for years.  I don't recognize anybody.  I recognize atoms.  Not A-T-A-M.  A-T-O-M.  Who are you?  Hello?  Ah!  He's petrified.  I even yelled to him one day, it's Opie from the Opie and Anthony show after he gave me the ah face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it made him walk faster.  He doesn't care.  He's petrified.  Okay, I quickly get to where I'm going.  Ah, lactate.  He just knows about physics. 
[03:00:00]  His head is full of physics and he has no social skills.  None.  Can we get him on the phone?  I don't know.  We're trying?  On a ring, he'll get scared.  Ah!  Numbers, calculations, dash, apostrophe, comma, quote, dash, apostrophe, multiply, hi.  Oh, my God!  I've only seen you 50 times on a ring!  Ah!  Ah!  They're trying him right now.  Listen.  Ah, no.  Maybe.  Okay.  We'll just say hi.  Yeah, if we get him on, just ask personal questions in between the real shit and see how he handles it. 
[03:00:30]  Troy's calling him right now.  All right.  We'll see.  Oh, Troy with the girl pants.  Cool odds.  He forgot his socks yesterday, too.  Oh, it was fucking...  He looks like a girl in 1950 in the beach.  It was fucking...  It's awful.  Wearing his pedal pushers.  Exactly.  They should be pussing up rose petals.  Get it?  Because he's dead.  Pussing up rose petals.  Yes. 
[03:01:00]  That was Freudian.  Yes.  Pussing.  Pussing.  Pussing up rose petals.  What do you think of Popeye?  Ah!  What's the matter, Dr. Coxgoo?  Oh, shit.  Jimmy, that's fucking funny, man.  I really thought it was just me.  No.  He's...  Say hi to him, and he fucking stares at me like I'm holding an axe.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking...  Fucking Shelly Long was happier to see Nicholson.  Or Shelly Duvall. 
[03:01:30]  Shelly Duvall.  One or the other.  She should have chased Shelly Long.  Get that fat pig Callie Erste in there.  Callie Erste!  Callie Erste!  Oh, that's the sign of a tumor in my old head-a-roo.  I just said, Callie Erste.  Callie Erste!  That's a bertation.  Oh, wow.  You just had a bertation.  That is great.  Callie Erste.  Speaking of fucking giant hail, I have a tumor the size of one fucking destroying my brain. 
[03:02:00]  Ah!  Lumpy brains.  You like to look at...  It's like Callie Erste.  Big bosoms.  What is that?  The fat tits.  Well, it is whipping my Wednesday.  We gotta get that going again on Twitter.  What is that fat tits?  They probably smell like a lamb underneath them.  Spy Guy 925.  Thank you for the big boobies.  I am.  Am I allowed to retweet that or are we getting in trouble for that?  I don't want to retweet nudity.  Big fucking tits.  I know.  They get upset about.  Her arms are up in the air, though.  That could be rough.  Yeah.  She's going, oh, what the fudge?  Yeah, it's no big deal. 
[03:02:30]  So why is this taking so long?  Oh, he's talking to him right now.  I am afraid.  And he hung up.  No.  He was having cell phone issues.  Troy was literally yelling into the phone.  Okay.  Maybe he was yelling over his screaming.  Yeah.  Hi, how are you?  Ah!  Who is this?  So we're going to call him back in five minutes.  Weak signal area?  Yeah, I think he was in a weak signal area.  Yeah, I think he's going to go on.  Should we take a quick break?  And then we'll have Dr. Cocker to end the show today?  Yeah, let's do that.  Hopefully we'll have him on.  Because we've got to get to the bottom of this.  How come you don't remember us? 
[03:03:00]  Our feelings are very hurt.  We like you.  Very hurt.  You want to bring all that up instead?  Oh, yeah.  That's what I want to talk to him about.  All right.  How come you don't remember us?  You think we're...  I feel guilty when I say hi to you because I feel like you don't like us.  I don't.  Oh, I don't.  I've seen your...  Imagine if he knows everything about us.  Yes, I don't like your Ozzy Osbourne obsession or your mediocre jokes.  You watch him know everything about...  I liked you better on BAB.  You guys were much better on NEW.  What happened?  I don't like your choice of, quote, girls. 
[03:03:30]  You bring into the elevator.  Yes, Twato lost me.  All right.  Yes.  Yes.  I don't like all the ladies with Adam's apples that follow you through the lobby.  All right.  You're right.  I forgot.  I apologize.  All right.  Kaku, hopefully next.  Stay there.  Three, two, one.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  This is Dr. Michio Kaku.  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  This is Dr. Michio Kaku.  Kaku, kaku, kaku.  Three, kaku, kaku, kaku, kaku. 
[03:04:00]  Two, kaku, kaku.  Michio Kaku.  One, one, one, one, one, one.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  We're getting Michio Kaku on the phone, huh?  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba.  Apparently, that's what the word is on the street.  Well, we can play something before that.  What can we play? 
[03:04:30]  A flock of birds.  Okay, what is this?  I only imagine.  I think I know.  Here we go.  I think it's...  Is this Dr. Michu Kaku?  Yes.  How are you, sir?  It's been a while.  Hi, Dr. Kaku.  Did you forget about us?  Yeah, I'm right here.  Yes.  Dr. Kaku, we've seen you on the news of late, 
[03:05:00]  talking about the wildfires and perhaps the nuclear facility at Los Alamos.  Right.  In fact, the fire is three miles away from a major plutonium waste dump at Los Alamos.  Uh-oh.  This is the moment of truth now.  What are some of the dangers that can be encountered from this fire if it does reach the facility?  Well, there are up to 30,000 canisters of plutonium waste three miles from the fire. 
[03:05:30]  They're just sitting above ground, not even protected.  Oh, wow.  And in protected sites, by the way, sites that are locked down, we have up to six tons of plutonium.  This is plutonium from the weapons program.  Hopefully, no terrorist will sift through the wreckage of a fire and grab some of this plutonium.  But six tons worth of plutonium is also stored on site in a secured area.  But the unsecured area is what's causing all the worry right now because it's low-level plutonium waste. 
[03:06:00]  Plutonium is the most toxic chemical known to science.  A microgram that you can't even see, a particle, in your lungs will cause lung cancer.  Wow.  So the danger is that a fire will over-pressurize the drums, pop them open, and then liquids will boil, and a lot of solid materials will vaporize, and it will have a plutonium cloud emerging over Los Alamos.  Or not.  And then, of course, the winds will whip it up.  Winds travel at about 60 miles an hour in that area. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  So when are you going to blow your head off of them, right?  Yeah, that's right.  That's a danger, that there could be a plume of plutonium rising from Los Alamos, sweeping down.  Now, the fire department, of course, says everything's under control.  But two years ago, the Department of Energy issued an amazing thing.  That's probably a department where they get stuff done fast because it's all energy, right?  No, the Department of Energy is, we all know what that is, Chip.  Thank you.  So the fire department said, what, sir?  Why are you going to fire the whole department? 
[03:07:00]  What did they do?  Yeah, they criticized the fire department for being not up to speed.  They would be overwhelmed if there was a fire involving sophisticated nuclear materials.  I would think, what are they talking, is there an evacuation plan?  Are there residents around that area?  Yeah, the residents are out.  The whole town's been evacuated.  It's a ghost town now.  Only fire crews are allowed on site.  And remember that fire crews could easily be overwhelmed if the wind changes direction. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, absolutely, yes.  What happens if the wind gets all blown and stuff and if the nuclear stuff's getting blown  all over your hat like danger or something?  I mean, is that bad for the fire department or something?  Well, it would be bad for everybody if the money and dust got in the air because it'd be  invisible.  It would sweep down like in a plume and get your hair, your nostrils, your clothing, vegetation.  It would be a real mess if that happened.  But is it something to do with the computers, like war games or something?  I was telling people it's scandals that.  Yeah, but remember that right now, the department could be overwhelmed completely if the winds 
[03:08:00]  change directions, if the wind whips up more debris.  The fire department, by the way, says there's a canyon.  There's a canyon separating the waste dump from the fire.  But, you know, ashes, embers could very easily...  Burn in embers is my band.  Yeah, they could actually hold on to some of this nuclear material and carry it pretty  far, I would gather.  All right.  So we have to be very careful about this. 
[03:08:30]  And like I said before, we also have secured sites, with some of them underground, some of  them above ground in steel buildings.  But these buildings have never been tested against a major fire.  So it's a science project as to whether or not we can contain six tons of plutonium fuel  that could be used in a carbon bomb.  Almost as bad as seven tons.  What type of radius area of...  Steel belted.  What type of area of toxicity are we looking at here? 
[03:09:00]  Well, if you take a look at Chernobyl and Fukushima, most of the radiation was concentrated within  about 10 to 15 miles.  The dead zone around Chernobyl is around 19 miles.  The dead zone around Fukushima will be approximately that same radius, about 19 miles.  And in that area, it's a ghost town.  No one's allowed there.  Right.  You know, there's no economic activity.  No one lives there.  It's basically off limits for, you know, several centuries. 
[03:09:30]  So the whole town is probably like, right?  Nobody would be going to the movies or nothing there.  It's just something like that, right?  Well.  Yeah, right.  Remember, Los Alamos is a crown jewel of our nuclear weapons program, and it could become  a ghost town if, and this is a big if, if plutonium leaks out of those canisters.  Yes.  Now, Los Alamos, that is still an operational facility.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, of course it is.  They maintain our nuclear arsenal.  That's where the atomic bomb was built.  Underground testing took place.  In fact, the fires are now raging right over the area where we used to do underground nuclear 
[03:10:00]  tests in New Mexico.  Wow.  And we still regularly, regularly handle plutonium there on site.  That's what the...  Is it heavy?  Wow.  Do you carry it?  How do you get it from around?  I thought it was supposed to be bad or something.  Well, first of all, plutonium in metallic form is very heavy, but it's very small.  How much is it, like 50 pounds or something?  Well, the basic components of the Nagasaki bomb would be about the size of a softball. 
[03:10:30]  Right, right, right.  The actual plutonium itself is rather compact and rather small, but there's hundreds of  bombs' worth of fuel on site.  It's a bomb.  It only takes about 20 pounds to create an atomic bomb.  So the bomb...  Yeah.  The bomb that got dropped over Nagasaki was only the size of a softball?  Was the plutonium?  That's right.  The actual plutonium itself is a little bit bigger than a softball.  In fact, one of my acquaintances, Professor Philip Morrison at MIT, 
[03:11:00]  actually loaded the Nagasaki bomb with his bare hands.  Oh, really?  He had the hemisphere in his hands.  Don't shake his hands.  He loaded it with his bare hands.  And I once asked him, how do you load a Nagasaki bomb?  Yeah.  And he said, very carefully.  Ah!  See?  I don't get it.  That's the actual way to do it.  His nickname was Stumpy.  Very carefully.  Now, for the layman here, Dr. Kaku, there is not any chance of an actual nuclear explosion 
[03:11:30]  from this.  No.  No.  No.  First of all, to create a nuclear detonation, you have to have a trigger.  And the trigger is a very precise set of explosives which explode the plutonium.  So even Iran, for example, even if Iran and Korea, North Korea, they would have problems  compressing the plutonium fuel.  Yes.  It is made into what they call a critical mass.  What?  That's called a charge, right?  Using either shape charges or some type of a... 
[03:12:00]  Charge cards?  Actually, a cannon system, I believe, was used in one of the first atomic bombs.  That's right.  Nick Cannon's good.  The Hiroshima bomb used a gun principle.  Or the Hiroshima.  Yes.  Everywhere.  Think of Pac-Man, a pie-shaped thing with a slice coming out.  That's Pac-Man.  So think of Pac-Man made out of uranium.  Right.  And then one pie piece...  Oh, Pac-Mans?  ...into the other Pac-Man piece.  Right, yeah.  I was never any good at that game.  I used to never get past the third board or something. 
[03:12:30]  And that would make the critical mass...  The critical mass is about the size of your fist.  Right.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  I like to box.  What would limit the size of an atomic explosion?  Let's say you could come up with nuclear weapons-grade fuel the size of, let's say, a beach ball.  Would you be able to use that and have an explosion to turn that into its own critical mass and have a gigantic nuclear explosion? 
[03:13:00]  So big that it knocked everybody, the sun off of something.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of my colleagues was Ted Taylor, and he actually designed that bomb you're talking about.  Oh, really?  I remember working closely together.  Yes.  He was designed by Ted Taylor.  Ted Taylor.  Of course, Ted.  Is that his real name?  Yeah.  It sounds like a fake name.  Is it Tetley Taylor?  Ted Taylor.  And what difficulties are there in something that large? 
[03:13:30]  What would be different than using something the size of a softball?  How much does it weigh if you've got to pick up, like, 50 pounds of it?  Don't listen to him.  Oh, it's quite heavy, right?  I actually want to know what the difficulties would be in a bomb that big.  Yeah, would you be able to throw it at people or something?  There are difficulties in engineering something that big.  That's why we go to hydrogen bombs.  That's why hydrogen bombs could also be roughly the same size, and they would yield 1,000 times more energy than atomic bombs. 
[03:14:00]  Now, don't hydrogen bombs use atomic explosives as some type of primer or trigger?  Or is that just a big rumor?  That's right.  A hydrogen bomb uses lithium deuteride.  Lithium deuteride is something you can buy from a chemistry store.  But lithium deuteride in concentrated form is the basic fuel of a hydrogen bomb.  Right.  And you use the atomic bomb as a fuse, as a fuse.  Wow.  That's a good network.  A hydrogen bomb.  That is something.  And now all these materials reside at Los Alamos, and there's a fire sweeping maybe towards this area. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, it's a heck of a broom.  What precautions are they taking besides just getting fire crews out there?  Are they doing anything at the plant to try to protect these, especially the exposed fuel?  Is there hay around it?  Well, the basic fail-safe is to use foam to get fire trucks and spray foam on top of these canisters. 
[03:15:00]  And that's it.  I love you so much.  That's it.  That's it.  Just trying to keep them as cool as possible.  These are your tax dollars that work.  Yeah, the fire is a fire.  Go ahead.  If the wind changes direction, if the fire engulfs this area, it's all over.  Sure, the fire is hot.  Wow.  I got burned one time when I was a kid.  How worried are you, sir?  Well, right now, the winds are dying down at the present time.  Perfect.  It's not as windy.  However, the winds are unpredictable. 
[03:15:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  Unpredictable.  Sure.  And we have a three-mile barrier between the fire and the actual sighted zone.  Four miles would be better, right?  Aren't there, Dr. Cago, aren't there certain chemicals besides foam that could encase, you  know how they spray beams with flame-retardant material to keep metal from melting during  a high-rise fire?  Couldn't they spray these canisters and maybe have a little more time if a fire does sweep 
[03:16:00]  through?  Yeah, like maybe throw mattresses on them or something.  They can throw everything but the kitchen sink at the canisters.  Right.  I know, like it's right in old Denny or something.  Remember, it's just the local fire department.  We're not talking about the United States military coming in.  Now, if it is something that big, why wouldn't they have the National Guard come in and maybe...  He's only one guy.  That's why it's too much work for one person, probably.  Maybe start taking some precautions before something happens.  Like cookie people.  Well, that's what I would suggest. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  Right now, I think they don't want to create panic.  And so I think that's why they're downplaying the danger.  Right.  And I think that's going to happen.  Right.  But, you know, just last year, another report came out saying that there's a lack...  I hate doing reports.  ...in case of a fire.  Yeah.  ...in case of a fire that happens.  And then, as I mentioned two years ago, they said that the local fire department would  be overwhelmed in case of a major fire.  And that's kind of what's happening.  ...are coming true.  And that's what we're looking at.  Wow.  They said you have to mention your book, too.  It's like Physics of the Future. 
[03:17:00]  Yes.  And it was a nine-Times bestseller.  That's New York Times bestseller.  New York Times bestseller.  I thought it was any Times bestseller.  It was a bestseller at any time.  Physics of the Future.  Yeah, Physics of the Future by Dr. Kaku.  This book has really taken off.  A lot of people...  Really enjoying it.  ...I know are really enjoying this.  You take physics and really do make it entertaining for the layman, make it understandable, and  kind of incorporate things from entertainment and whatnot, and our basic questions that we 
[03:17:30]  have about physics.  And you do a great job.  Well, let me...  Do you address...  Do you address stuff like...  It's very practical in the sense that physics will change our lives.  Uh, the book takes you to the year 2100.  He's better at ignoring the chip than I am.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The book takes you to the year 2100, but even 10 years from now, the internet, for example,  will be in our contact lens.  Yep.  Yep.  So we will blink.  So we will go online.  Yeah, but you probably need to...  And your contact lens will identify people's faces, so you'll know always who you're talking 
[03:18:00]  to.  No more awkward moments of saying, oh, who is that person?  I had contacts, but my prescription was changing.  And so what would happen if you had, like, internet contacts and your prescription was  no good or something?  Ow.  Uh, well, you might have a problem there.  However...  Put dry stuff on them, right?  At a cocktail party, we'll always know who to suck up to at a cocktail party.  Right.  Exactly.  What's that?  I never got invited to one.  Dr. Cocko.  Dr. Cocko, I got a question for you.  Yeah, OPS has something to ask you, sir. 
[03:18:30]  When you're not doing physics, what do you like to do?  Uh, well, realize that physics is everywhere, so I basically apply it.  Apply it to the future, apply it to our daily life.  Sure, like an application of thought.  You know, everywhere you move, it's physics, right?  Yeah.  Jim Norton has just entered the studio, and I got to tell you, sir, me and Jim Norton live  very close to you.  Very close.  We don't want to give away your location, but we're pretty much your neighbors.  And, uh, I, I've noticed that I've yelled, uh, hi to you a couple times, and, um, you 
[03:19:00]  don't, you don't say hi back, and I think maybe there, there might be a problem or something.  You're not mad at us, are you?  You're not mad at us, are you?  Huh?  Either that or else I'm nearsighted and missed you.  Is that what it is?  See, it could just be as, uh, as classes.  Next time you hear someone yell, hey, Dr. Cocko, Opie from the Opie and Anthony show,  that's me.  And I just want to say hi, because I know you're, you live in the neighborhood.  Uh-huh.  Okay, I will.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, Dr. Cocko, uh, thank you so much.  Jimmy, you have anything to add to this?  Oh, Jimmy, anything. 
[03:19:30]  Jimmy's back in studio.  Yeah, one time I was on the elevator, and, uh, I was like, it's a good job.  It's got its ups and downs.  Dr. Cocko, thank you so much for, uh, joining us.  Uh, we were very curious about this, uh, Los Alamos, uh, nuclear, uh, facility on the  fire.  Yeah, good thing they found Alamos.  They lost it.  And, uh, uh, you're our go-to guy as far as physics go, and, uh, good luck with the book,  and we'll talk to you again soon.  No need to call him a goat.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dr. Cocko.  Wait one second.  Dr. Bichu Cocko.  How much does the earth weigh? 
[03:20:00]  Six sextillion tons.  Thank you.  That's a lot.  I guessed five.  Everybody told me I was crazy.  What's a sextillion?  Is that like a tillion that looks really good?  Oh, my God.  Thank you, Dr. Cocko.  Thank you, Dr. Cocko.  How much does the sun weigh in kilograms?  All right, all right.  Let the good doctor go.  He's got TV interviews to do, sir.  Oh, my God.  Thank you, sir.  There he goes.  I've never been so embarrassed with anyone on the phone in my life.  Wait, what was my favorite? 
[03:20:30]  Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you asshole.  Oh, that had me fucking on the edge.  You flipped that because that wasn't the reason.  I had to bite my tongue.  That wasn't the reason we were going to have him on the phone.  Oh, God damn.  We have line of the day.  You do that at the 10 o'clock hour, Sam.  Because we've got to play a flock of beats before we get out of here.  Oh, that's a good band. 
[03:21:00]  Chip is really not a good interviewer.  No, Chip is a horrible interviewer.  He just interrupts.  He asks, dumps all questions.  He did do a great job of just focusing and concentrating.  He's oblivious to Chip, like myself.  I like that.  It's like, so next time say hi.  And he's like, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  People are so annoyed on Twitter.  Fucking Chip, shut the fuck up.  Jim, I am feeling so uncomfortable right now with your call with Kaku. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah, that's what a lot of people are saying over here, too.  Like, oh, my God, I can't even listen to this.  Chip is, it got me so embarrassed for myself.  Jim Norton, Chip, shut the fuck up or something.  to shut the fuck up  with something.  Jim Norton, shut up.  I'm so happy.  I annoyed them.  I saw you, I was trying to do a real interview,  so I was like, well, you know.  No, no, that works. 
[03:22:00]  That was a whole gag.  That was a whole gag, just like  to an interview with him,  dumb fucking Chip is saying,  here is Shima, there is Shima.  Everywhere.  Shima, Shima, Shima.  It's a fucking scientist on the phone.  How did that kill me?  That was perfect.  We got the info out in a very unusual way.  It's Flock of Burt's.  I said that, didn't I?  I said Beats.  We had Burt, how do you say his last name again? 
[03:22:30]  He was great.  Burt's Beats?  Burt the Conqueror.  Burt the Conqueror was on yesterday.  Burt Kreishner.  Kreishner, thank you.  Or Burt the Trunk.  It's also good.  Yeah, Burt the Trunk.  Exactly.  Yeah, Burt Young from fucking Rocky.  He drinks more.  So there's a turkey out the window.  He had a great appearance on our show yesterday,  and we noticed that he laughed a lot,  so we put together something here,  or the boys did, I should say,  called Flock of Burt's.  Flock of Burt's.  This is Flock of Burt's.  Play turkey, Burt. 
[03:23:00]  Ah, summertime.  What a day for the beach.  Absolute bliss.  You hungry little fella?  Have a French fry.  No, no, don't feed the Burt's.  Why not?  Great, now they're going to swarm us  and never leave us alone.  Holy shit, that's some Flock of Burt's.  I told you not to feed them.  No, get away.  Get away.  Get away. 
[03:23:30]  Get away.  Get away.  Get away.  Get away.  Fucking Burt's.  I like it.  It sounded like a bunch of guy laughing or something.  Yeah.  No.  Those were Burt's.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  I think we're done.  Yeah, let's let Sam do that fucking thing.  I'm just going to spin the wheel.  Well, Roland is going to.  Oh, that's right.  We'll spin the wheel to see the house. 
[03:24:00]  That's right.  If you're, oh, before I forget, Raw Dog today, 5 p.m.  East Coast, 2 o'clock West Coast.  I interview, we talk about Tracy Morgan, two gay comics I know.  It was a really good interview, I think, with Jim David and Rick Crome.  So if you want to listen to that, I think it came out pretty good.  Yeah, right on.  I'll check it out.  All right, guys.  Cool.  Later.  See you tomorrow.  See you tomorrow. </pre>
