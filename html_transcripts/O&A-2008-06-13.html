<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts bragging about their high ratings, particularly their dominance among male listeners. Opie mentions a recent acupuncture treatment.  The conversation abruptly shifts to a serious topic: a listener, Tom, who called the previous day expressing suicidal thoughts. The hosts recount their efforts to talk Tom down, detailing a moment where one of Tom's guns accidentally discharged, resulting in police intervention. They debate their handling of the situation, contrasting their current approach with what they perceive as a more callous past approach.  Opie receives significant, and somewhat humorous, media attention, highlighted by a Daily News headline focusing solely on his role in the incident.

The show then delves into the media coverage, criticizing the framing of the story and the disproportionate focus on Opie.  This leads to a discussion about their program director, Steve Carlisi, who served as their spokesperson.  Anthony's relationship with traffic reporter Jill Nicolini is also discussed, along with the existence of a website documenting their romance.  The hosts continue to banter about Tom's suicide note, the accidental gunshot, and the ethics of their intervention.  A caller, a former suicide intervention specialist, criticizes Anthony's handling of the situation, sparking a heated argument.

The conversation then transitions to more personal topics.  They discuss Anthony's difficult relationship with a staff member, Danny.  Comedian Patrice O'Neal joins the show, and the conversation shifts to the Lakers-Celtics NBA Finals, Kobe Bryant's personality, allegations of fixed games and corrupt referees, and the hostsâ€™ and O'Neal's superstitious beliefs.  A lengthy discussion follows about another comedian, Rich Vos's wedding, the hosts' resentment at not being invited, and the perceived awkwardness surrounding the event.  They debate the wedding's logistics and Rich Vos's choices, speculating on whether they would have attended.  The discussion concludes with jokes about college, kids, and Rich Vos's health issues.

Further segments explore various topics.  The hosts discuss the perceived uselessness of college, one host recounting a story about manipulating a professor.  They also discuss one host's upcoming wedding and his cynical views on marriage, contrasting with his girlfriend's enthusiasm.  *The Incredible Hulk* and *The Happening* are reviewed, with the latter and M. Night Shyamalan's work receiving harsh criticism.  Kevin Costner's career is also analyzed.  The hosts revisit Tom's suicide attempt, recounting the experience and the subsequent media coverage, including a humorous anecdote about the Daily News headline. They discuss their emotional responses, interspersed with humorous anecdotes and reenactments of their relationship timeline, including when they first said "I love you."  They also discuss the significant media attention surrounding their relationship, including the website tracking their romance.  During these segments, Patrice O'Neal, members of the "Philly crew," and Basil Teas, a chef, are in the studio.

A subsequent segment focuses on the emotional aftermath of Tom's suicide attempt.  Jim Norton, a guest, joins the discussion, expressing their unsettling proximity to such a serious event and their emotional disconnect.  The conversation broadens to discuss suicide in general, comparing reactions to 9/11 and the suicides of celebrities like Heath Ledger and Richard Jeni. They debate the selfishness of suicide versus the immense pain leading to it, touching upon Dr. Jack Kevorkian and the difficulties of governing assisted suicide.  Anthony creates a darkly comedic parody "Anthony Cumia Suicide Hotline."  The conversation then shifts to the 2008 presidential election, focusing on Barack Obama, race, and politics.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and D.L. Hughley (who joins in studio) engage in a heated debate, marked by frequent use of offensive language, covering Obama's policies, the potential impact of a black president, and cynicism toward politicians.

A further segment centers on the 2008 presidential election and race relations, with Patrice O'Neal expressing his views on the pressure on Black people to collectively respond to the actions of individuals within their race.  He discusses his political views, criticizes both parties, and critiques the American political system.  The conversation delves into racial identity, white guilt, and the role of race in the election.  D.L. Hughley appears as a guest, contributing to the political discussion.  The hosts frequently interject with commentary, jokes, and tangents.

The final segment focuses on Patrice O'Neal's relationship dynamics and views on monogamy.  He discusses tensions with his wife regarding his radio persona.  They discuss Jackie Robinson's selection as the first Black player in Major League Baseball, and engage in vulgar and sexually explicit banter, including hypothetical sexual encounters involving Michelle Obama and Cindy McCain. D.L. Hughley and Red, an American Gladiator, are guests.  The show includes tangents, including Patrice's interactions with fans and celebrities. The segment concludes with the exchange of gifts and closing remarks.  A significant portion of the conversation remains sexually charged and offensive.

[00:01:30]  gotta love it i made a mistake i got the bagel i got my usual crappy dry stupid bagel because i  didn't know you didn't see the the equipment coming through all morning long no i was just in the 
[00:02:00]  office how do you not notice a guy setting up for breakfast he's got two frying pans he's got a huge  coffee urn he's got all sorts of juices and fruits and vegetables and granola a big big huge thing of  uh raw raw meat coming through the door reading the papers i was nervous what did he say i was nervous  i was you was nervous what uh but you know something it's so good yeah that i'm gonna have an omelet 
[00:02:30]  anyway there you go that's how good it is are you wearing the same clothes from last night no all  right i was wearing nice clothes yesterday i'm in really paramilitary gear today i see the most part  i'm again dressed like young fidel castro it's the opn ortega show it's my uh 511 gear i see that  thank you love 511 phone number 877-212-0&a where to begin today where to begin how important is the 
[00:03:00]  beginning of the show pretty damn important pretty damn important uh corporate calls me yesterday  afternoon i gotta call them out and they were fishing around yesterday were they fishing doing a little  fishing around did you know that tom was gonna call yesterday no i go look man who the hell is  asking no no no no no no everyone thought you guys handled it perfectly just wondering  like as as organically as it sounded on the radio is how it went down we were in the middle of doing 
[00:03:30]  our show and uh our good friend tom called from is tom alive friday and uh he decided yesterday was  the day he was going to check out and just knowing tom over the last year or so we knew he was dead  serious we knew he was serious just how he was talking in past tense and stuff like that  so the whole thing went down yesterday and obviously tom did not kill himself which i don't even know 
[00:04:00]  and because i've been doing a lot of thinking i don't even know if that's a good thing to be honest  with you what because the guy i don't know who what i was thinking about i don't know i don't know what  the right thing is it's not i i know this much it's not it's not up to me well of course not but  i think it was our responsibility to try to deter him from doing it on our very program of course that  that uh without saying yeah but then all all day long yesterday i'm thinking about i'm like the guy's 
[00:04:30]  life just sucks and it's and it's only going to get worse this is the right medical treatment you  never know yeah i know i know that's what we're hoping for right but this has been a moral question  for the ages does somebody have the right if their life their quality of life is in the crapper  to uh end their own life it's been debated for for centuries yeah um and you know who the hell are we  to judge all i know is it sounded to me like it was a guy that was miserable and uh needed a hand 
[00:05:00]  yeah a little reaching out to and uh it obviously postponing uh the inevitable whether it's natural  or unnatural but you know if the guy if somebody wants to off themselves they're gonna do it you can't  watch him uh 24 hours a day but you know that moment yesterday i don't think it was appropriate so  no of course not i want to make that perfectly clear but i'm just saying you know like i said yesterday 
[00:05:30]  too the old o and a probably would have egged him on i believe me i wish i could go back in a time  machine to the old o and a and slap him around a little bit there would have been a few uh we don't  believe you yeah go ahead do it see if we care no i don't even know we'd have been horrible i don't  think we ever were that bad but we would oh we were so that bad no we would have done it differently  like we don't we don't believe you have a god come on all right go ahead let me see yeah all right 
[00:06:00]  come on all right for just shoot it right next to your head like that's how it would have gone  and we'd have progressively gotten him to just shove it in his mouth and fire and then we'd have been  fired yeah that's the old o and a it was a crazy day the the best part was when we finally talked  him out of uh not killing himself and then he uh was unloading his guns and one went off yeah and  that unfortunately got the cops involved bong made that nice ringing sound that you hear at the range 
[00:06:30]  yeah i like that sound though and then uh the cops uh got to tom and got him to a hospital i believe  and that's where he sits uh this morning rikers hospital what hospital no he's at a hospital  somewhere is he so i don't know it was i hope he's being taken care of we like tom it was a weird  day i want to thank the daily news because you know they they understand exactly what's going on  uh with this radio show they uh the headline says opie uh opie you know save someone from killing 
[00:07:00]  himself oh yeah yeah that was interesting where's the headline i read that one i'm like gee i good  thing uh me and jimmy sat back shaking unable to even contribute right and uh opie talked him in  this wasn't too awkward when it came up on google alert yesterday radio show this is the headline  radio show host opie that's right there's gonna be no anthony no no jim no nothing nothing it just 
[00:07:30]  says radio show host opie talks listener out of suicide attacks with a big picture of just opie  but with the part of the opie and anthony sign that just says oh oh i know it couldn't possibly  i actually looked at who wrote it because i thought that too was opie  look what can i tell you you guys are you're you're in front of greatness we're bit players you  certainly are i'm a hero to the common man and you're lucky to be around me face face apparently 
[00:08:00]  face and face i know opie was talking a severely ill man of killing himself while anthony and jim  were just going do it do it yes but opie probably stepped in that couldn't be that couldn't be more  obnoxious the headline the picture of just me the sign in the background just says opie i don't know  what happened there i read that headline i was like wait a minute i seem to remember chiming in a couple  of times and i know damn well jimmy uh was pretty instrumental in keeping him from blowing his head 
[00:08:30]  off but uh radio host opie opie saves the man from killing himself carly steve carlisi really uh  oh he showed up in the article quite a few times boy did he but steve well i want to ask steve why uh  he talked to richard that's spelled c-a-i why why didn't richard huff talk to me or or anthony or 
[00:09:00]  or jim norton yesterday why did he talk to the program director steve carlisi  when did you give yourself that title all right general manager steve carlisi  the brains of the operation president of cbs programming steve carlisi hold on i'm writing all  he's down soon to take over for less moonfez after playing the hit foundry song pendulum  they went to tom nice  who doesn't love this song get out of my way i'm gonna free people right now don't 
[00:09:30]  pendulum's gonna swing the other way i want i want this song to get so big that you have to go find  that that dopey band of yours and don't be banned get back together and then like do like a like a  like a like a five a five day tour of i don't know jersey jersey yeah definitely jersey where you have 
[00:10:00]  to go to lane bryan and get dresses again so what happened steve why are you the uh the spokesperson  for the show and why why aren't we talking to richard huff um i love how everyone tries to protect us  from the media no it wasn't that at all i was driving around i didn't get home until eight o'clock  last night i was running around a lot and i thought he was calling for little bits of uh you know side  information i honestly didn't know that he was typing the entire time it really didn't did never  dawned on me and then when i saw my name i was like oh i'm sure this will get brought up  yeah and right you are holy yes i just got a uh an email from mayor bloomberg of this fine city 
[00:10:30]  oh really and he's offering just me uh a key to the city a key to the city yes so hero dj opi  yes so uh i love the uh quote leave early today the quotes they uh they they attributed to you  were really good um they uh a lot of carlisi carlisi carlisi carlisi carlisi i was upload okay  here here's what here's uh anthony's big quote um it's a show host anthony cumia opi uh greg here 
[00:11:00]  is in common jim norton realized i'm surprised they use smaller font um realizing tom wasn't kidding  trying to talk about doing anything serious to seek help and this is anthony's quote i don't  think we really want you to offer yourself on the air cumia said jesus jesus they have me quoted  saying jesus twice yeah yeah jesus and then oh late a little later oh jesus responded oh geez margie  well because there were real emotions going on yesterday and you know yeah that scares anthony so 
[00:11:30]  he throws out a few jesus's i think i'm like an old lady though oh god help us and save us  did mr so davis hey jimmy you didn't read the the headline oh jesus oh lord oh jesus and baby  jesus hold on uh jimmy didn't read the headline of uh oh yeah radio uh show host opie yeah talks  listeners out of suicide attempt um the host of radios opie and anthony show talk to severely  ill man of killing himself in the air thursday morning so for some reason it didn't make the paper 
[00:12:00]  though because i guess uh people attempting to kill themselves on a live radio show is uh is not  important enough to actually be in the paper just online no it isn't that we're complaining trust me  but but uh my whirlwind romance is important enough to be in the paper that made it i see that really  oh yeah you kind of got slammed by richard huff well richard huff is just saying it gives people like  him hope well let me uh let me read what did make the paper today oh jesus oh oh jeez they're really 
[00:12:30]  in love said carlisi in tube talk uh let's see in tube talk radio host opie's flacky anthony  while opie is saving yeah this is how it says it uh while opie was saving a listener from killing  themselves yesterday on on their radio show seems the off-air love affair between radio host anthony 
[00:13:00]  cumia of opie and anthony and channel 11 traffic uh reporter jill nicolini as well uh real a website  www.antholini.com which by the way could be the most obnoxious website i've ever been to in my life  has been created to track the romance after looking at the pictures of the happy couple  the upside of this merger of media titans media titans thank you finally put in the proper context 
[00:13:30]  we are media titans are you she's the traffic girl and i'm a flat a flacky  uh the upside of this merger of media titans is that it gives single guys who might look like the  married guy at the top of the opposite page hope and then he writes just saying so richard huff is  kind of making fun of his own well richard huff is hoping that uh you know ghoulish look he can uh  you know score a a jill nicolini yeah this is richard huff we love this guy uh we got him on the air 
[00:14:00]  to beat him up and it turned out he turned us and now we're friends with richard huff be a good guy  but he still looks like a ghoul with that uh 70s porno mustache that's what i'm sporting you don't  have the 70s you got the you get the soul patch makes it though you get rid of the soul patch then  you look like a creep yeah i'm trying for the um three musketeers look like that yeah d'artanian  there was uh uh there was a suicide person that uh oh my god this feedback is unbelievable today  i used to be a cop that specialized in suicide intervention this is uh finch 
[00:14:30]  uh jimmy you did everything right and you show uh an authentic concern for this guy wow ob also but  prefer to stay quiet for for the most part uh-oh anthony you're an effing moron and could not care  if the guy killed himself what comment comment how why what did i what did i possibly do that was bad  i did and and listen mac i don't care what kind of training you've had i've had training in 
[00:15:00]  humanity and i know what humor can do and tom was laughing and and i was i was making  jokes of the situation but never making light of the situation and and keeping him laughing and in  good spirits so go screw i don't have time for you and your stupid training what do they tell you to  do hey i'm your friend you think anyone buys that when some cop comes wheeling up and and out of 
[00:15:30]  nowhere uh tells him it tells the guy that he's friends with him i go i have no idea who you are  and then i jump and tell him it's all his fault let him take that home to his family i think the  name of this show should be changed yes welcome to the godsend and life giver show with special guest  white angel uh well a lot of people are now uh calling me by my new name hero uh hey hero and

[00:19:30]  are kind of teasing you it really can make you feel better it really does like jay put you in  your place stupid like but you know that your friends there is something kind of familiar about  that yep um and there's something very warm about your friends kind of beating up on you a little  bit as long as you know that they they care about you yeah because that's the only reason they're  beating up on you like that because they you know give a crap about you right well because  they're detached sociopaths that too especially all you comics and then jimmy a bunch of lunatics i've 
[00:20:00]  met then jimmy continued i just want to say thanks uh on either way uh you guys have been  great and uh you know you're all really good people why don't you say thanks in person though  this is just kind of it's kind of a stupid way to go out i mean you can't hold off for a couple of  days it's not like it's gonna be 300 degrees tomorrow i mean why can't you hold off for a  couple of days there's no reason to not hold off just a weird weird day look at jimmy you you are  like the negotiator you know they're going why don't you come down amara you know giving him 
[00:20:30]  that one more day to think about a thing that jimmy does jimmy was the true hero opie oh no he was he  was trying to hey the newspapers never lie oh okay read the headline again true hero is trying to get  us all wiped out what an idiot i am tom just show up with your submachine gun and take it out on us  i was probably i probably did everything wrong i was trying to get the guy to come down and take  his rage out on a group full of office people yeah don't be confused by a couple of sound bites  the paper they never lie it says radio show host opie talks listener out of suicide my favorite part is 
[00:21:00]  the sign because they'll just show your picture just but the way they cut there's not even an n it's  not even open it's opie folks and then david virginia goes opie did great except when he yelled  attack team oh god i know holy jesus  yesterday a little later in the show what steve was writing a little note  because i was like what's going on and he was writing a note that obviously should have stayed 
[00:21:30]  private but what i read was so shocking i just yelled it out i'm like they're sending attack team  tactical team watch it's like maybe yeah maybe the person that's listening to the program shouldn't  know that the swat is going to his house donnie broscoe is really a cop  that's the worst  uh let's say hi to brooklyn ace brooklyn ace  victory victory dot it's time to load the glock 
[00:22:00]  very nice and uh it leads to um this as we take our first break anthony cumia's suicide hotline  ah yes this is the anthony cumia suicide hotline i think you show a lot of caring in this piece that  uh derek and steve put together yeah  thanks for calling the anthony cumia suicide hotline where the prominent radio host will  listen to your cry for help and with his patented five-step solution will hold your hand through this 
[00:22:30]  troubling time number one get way too excited about the suicide note what do your notes say i don't want  pity what does your notes say it says hey have a great run my time is now have fun number two  insult the author after the note is read that's it that's it you need to punch that up a little  you'll realize it's not about you it was never about you it was always about anthony and how he 
[00:23:00]  was gonna get his hands on your gun number three get too inquisitive about weapons what uh what kind  of weapon uh do you have there uh tom i have a i have a choice uh oh walter ppk or a beretta  nine millimeter or an ar-15 number four after shots are fired make sure to find out which gun it was  whoops hello what was that the 380 it was another nine millimeter and five ask for the weapons could i have your 
[00:23:30]  guns one will probably use it as an evidence but i'll put the other one away and i'll will it to  you anthony fantastic so if you're thinking about taking that big plunge why not will all your guns  over to anthony from the anthony cumia suicide hotline oh god that's morbid you know and i uh i was wrong  i hear a lot of compassion okay i'm really sorry that i would suggest that you don't have enough  an emotion in your body don't you think there should be a bit of comic relief during the whole 
[00:24:00]  thing just to keep them laughing and and and understand that that even if you're feeling  depressed or or in in ill health that you still can laugh i'm surprised you didn't brag about how  healthy you are how much money you make and and and what you're what you're dating these i never would  have brought up anything like that self-deprecation is always good i noticed jimmy using a little of  that for him to say hey we're all in the same boat you know of course uh his lungs are full of uh 
[00:24:30]  cement and uh ours aren't which really sucks but  but i know i think i served my purpose there you gave like we were a team you gave like 1930s advice  i i don't want to live anymore keep your chin up  get over it buck up yeah why don't you go get yourself a new hairdo

[00:30:30]  it sam on the point because sam looks like he's dying for that mike and yeah yeah pat duffy was just  in the office pointing out that e-rock still owes him money for the steve birthday cake that e-rock made  him by a couple months ago a couple what when you thought it was birth his birthday  no wait a minute where are you from jupiter where there's 10 hour days oh no i know why  i know i didn't get the money because he didn't give me the receipt for it he was supposed to give  me the receipt for for everything what are you gonna be audited and i gave him more than enough money and 
[00:31:00]  then what are you saving up to be iraq jewish it was less than a year ago though and there's only  one birthday per year that's yeah how much is the cake um i gave if i remember i gave duffy 40  it was he said he had to lay out more money for the cake why am i talking to you where's  pet where's the cake around let everyone see it and have a piece you know pay pat duffy he makes 
[00:31:30]  no money yeah that can't be right because i wouldn't i wouldn't yeah all right we can't be  right you're you thought february and then you do me like no i told them it was saturday they said  saturday not me and then you have friday written nine and then you have an email friday friday  getting flames and bears right yeah flames bear friday ah pat duffy you on that fourteen dollars  all right well you can take it out of the twenty they gave you because you couldn't uh get to the  train you have to take a cab to the train station thank you no you're not paid for it then

[00:32:30]  one two two uh five two four twenty five hundred uh or ticketmaster that's easy to remember no one's  gonna remember comics with an x when they're trying to find out uh you know where the joint is or how to  get tickets and and why after it the whole thing is who remembers that it seemed like a good idea at the  time when they were naming the place but come on comics c-o-m-i-x-n-y dot com the great patrice  o'neill and patrice uh the lakers blew it last night that was amazing and that's why i'm i'm in 
[00:33:00]  a coma right now because i was in a sleep my boy called me what about that win and i go excuse me  and he goes what about that win i go what win the sup i got and i had to get up i was up all night  watching lakers lost not not as much as uh celtics winning right the winning teams speeches are boring  they give you those same old you know we got to work hard but it's like uh kobe just trying to be  a like some type of nice guy and fight through it but it was so it was unbelievable i couldn't believe 
[00:33:30]  it man i gotta find uh the article i was just reading about kobe bryant and he's yeah he he has  decided to be a nice guy on the court and be the rah-rah guy and i was reading this article where  someone noticed you know kobe doing rah-rah and a player walking away rolling his eyes like oh  now he's decided to be a nice guy it's just disingenuous go after yourself no one's buying  into it it's like when he got he got the i'm a black guy tattoos after uh after the rape beef yeah  yeah like the key white people threw him out the window so he had to go rediscover his blackness by 
[00:34:00]  getting tattoos and there's uh allegations he might be doing something with uh one of the ex uh  lakers cheerleaders who's 18 or 19 years old oh who quit in the middle of the playoff run of course  he is he filled his his uh wife full of uh children she's all stretched out her stomach's all a mess  she probably gained a few and she's preoccupied raising the kids oh she's doing it now he can do  whatever the hell he wants he smells like milk oh god sugar water on the shirt uh he's getting 
[00:34:30]  greatest basketball player in the world uh tang are you're you're a huge celtics fan right uh  unbelievable i i matter of fact i didn't watch the game because i knew if i watched it they would  have never came back i'm watching the clips going if i watch this this wouldn't happen this way i  believe that i believe that too i'm like i only have two super superstitions one is don't put put a  hat on my bed you don't do that i can't fight through that i've fought through every superstition 
[00:35:00]  except for three actually don't sweep my feet don't be nice to anybody well that's nothing like  ground karma doesn't bother me i just get real calm karmatic when i fly but no hat on the bed and and  sweeping sweeping black people's feet is a dangerous thing sweeping black i have no idea but it's big  what's it means sweeping black yeah it's either death or jail no no but sweeping black you mean  when you're sweeping when you're sweeping the floor and like if you see watch black people when 
[00:35:30]  someone's sweeping the floor next to them they move away it's not good my girl is uh don't put a  purse on the floor that's her thing she can't get past and mine's his mine's his hat on the bed  but the other one is i don't want to watch a game of a big team i watched the super bowl patriots  lost i'm i'm i believe in that like if i had to watch the celtics last night there were no one  again but why the person on the floor i can almost understand i don't even know i have no no it's  superstition it's like you know you get prostate cancer like it's this hat on the bed is is death 
[00:36:00]  i think i've never heard that i've heard that that's an old old one but the sweeping the feet  dude that's gotta be a black thing i've never heard of it so it's real big in a real big  superstition i have two caps hanging on my bedposts i swear to god on your bed post is fine you can get  past that but you can't put a hat on your bed on the actual bed that's all i'm gonna do now is put  my hat i'm gonna get all my hats out of the closet and pile them on my bed i'm the hat bed kid 
[00:36:30]  celtics came back from an 18 point deficit i could not believe it 24 points they were down when i were  down 24 at one point it was 45 21 in that first half when i looked but it was the biggest halftime  deficit of of all time in the finals wow it's the biggest halftime deficit comeback of all times  actually not the biggest halftime deficit but come back to win the game i swear to god when i saw that  score i mean i didn't think that la would blow it but i'm like that's that's the type of score it's 
[00:37:00]  too big of a lead you want them to go to look at an eight point lead that there's something almost  too big about 24 points it's like almost the other team has nothing to lose and they're gonna play  but i just couldn't believe it man it's gonna it's over it's been it's over for the late i'm not  even comfortable i don't go watch the game go that's over you know they're not coming i have  nothing else to do oh boy they're not coming back oh i'll be saying they're not coming they're not  coming back coming back oh it's over biggest comeback in sports history not coming back i don't feel 
[00:37:30]  it i don't feel it now you're not feeling this i don't think this is going to happen i don't think  austin is too strong and they beat them in la it's over oh three games to one right it's  over well they got them they get boston's got to lose the next game because everyone knows that  the playoffs are fixed they want the these series to go as long as possible for the ratings and the  revenue speaking of the playoffs are fixed yeah are you staying up on this referee thing hell yeah i  am he's guilty as charged dude he's he's his i don't know if you have clips of david stern or whatever 
[00:38:00]  the the commissioner who but he's he's dismissing the guy as why are you listening to this ex-felon  this felon yeah but i'm like that's how the mafia was tumbled was he's a rat he's ratting on  everybody that the playoffs were fixed in 2002 and it's going to come out these dirty refs all of  them were dirty yeah all of them they're not protecting him so he's throwing them all under the  bus oh yeah it feels like you want to let me swing you're all coming down yeah and and jeff van 
[00:38:30]  gundy was uh fined how much like a hundred thousand dollars for for uh questioning that  game bitching about the refs because they said what's his name there they were going to foul  him a lot and someone told them they were going to foul him a lot yaoming yaoming thanks and uh  van gundy called him out on and got fined like over a hundred thousand dollars and now this uh  ref is basically backing up what jeff van gundy said and writers are saying right all these sports  guys are saying that that game it they remember that game as the worst referee game they've ever 
[00:39:00]  seen in their life who's but who's paying them to do that is it the nba itself that's going look we  need this to go a certain way uh because i can't it's probably it's never vegas man that's that's big  money dude like if you look if i if you do something you don't get Vegas it's big money for the nba  but is it mob stuff but that's what i'm saying if you get paid the nba play i don't know how much  a ref gets i bet you they don't make six figures i bet you they don't make six figures i i they make  they don't make a lot of money they they stay in crappy hotel they're not well taken care of like 
[00:39:30]  they're not they're not well they gotta be making to be to be loyal if somebody comes up to you and  gives you you know two grand three grand to make a call here and there oh they're making do they  making uh they're probably making a couple hundred thousand a year or at least i don't think they're  making a couple like first class um i know that because they were selling their tickets back and  keeping the extra money yeah they got to be making about 100 g's i would save more than that which is  which is not a lot when you're not sure thinking when you think about what the players have day  jobs then that's not all they do for a living well in the offseason i'm sure they're uh but if i'm an 
[00:40:00]  nba ref i should get paid enough to not have to ref for the other nine months yeah uh for the other  nine months so there you go go celtics go let's go to travis in virginia beach uh travis  hey what's up boys what's up patrice hey hey is it just me with this whole uh op hero thing is  just starting to remind me a little bit of bobby brady when he saved that little girl  throwing parties for himself wow yeah remember that one how did bobby save the girl like the 
[00:40:30]  father was bleeding and bobby pushed the girl out of the way so she didn't get any on him  look i know i know eroc's covering his ass by saying it was steve carlisi's birthday and he made  a mistake but we all know eroc set up the the the the fine breakfast today for me  for my big day yeah so i want to thank basil teas for coming by i believe it was that breakfast for  the hero and his and his pals travis travis  was that the episode i believe it was uh where the little girl was ready to be uh crushed at the 
[00:41:00]  ditmeyer's uh toy store yeah it was the bookcase it was gonna fall on her right it was gonna fall on  her and he saved her and then he just went around because everyone said he was a hero  and he took it so seriously that he started throwing parties for himself oh yeah he truly was  uh nba refs uh they make night because opie  i'm gonna throw a party for myself i'm a hero i save people 
[00:41:30]  opie obie why don't you come into my office i have an infection to give you i mean i have  something to give you we should get richard huff on the phone because i want to thank him for  understanding what's going on oh really yes uh nba refs base salary is 90k there patrice plus travel  and playoff cash highest paid is 280 000 a year oh 90 maybe base so patrice was uh pretty  chunk of change yeah all right we've got to take a break uh patrice o'neill at comics here in new 
[00:42:00]  york city c-o-m-i-x-n-y.com for tickets or call 212-524-2500 well oh wow this is just not working at  all today and it's playing i see you pushing a button frantically  yes you're perfectly pushing it but this is like no way to come back from a break it's no way to  treat a hero either yeah you were supposed to play the hero songs there oh e-rock i knew it was e-rock's 
[00:42:30]  fault with you e-rock oh my god can we start over we the play were you planning my birthday  just uh anthony be uh be like uh like a commercial guy like just say uh starts friday like it's the end  of a commercial oh in theaters this friday 
[00:43:00]  this isn't a hero song why wouldn't this is your bit today oh  e-rock finally has a bit and he can't even go through with it e-rock hold on let's try this  again uh anthony be a commercial guy again but you have to do a different one oh yes yes  now available in industrial size  ah thank you that's better you're checking out the opian anthony show lots going on we got patrice 
[00:43:30]  o'neill in studio playing comics with an x here in new york city tomorrow and uh saturday tomorrow  and saturday how about today and saturday how about today and tomorrow oh my god and uh we also got  uh steve from basil teas in toms river new jersey cooking up some fine omelets for everybody uh patrice  you were going to say or you were just pointing because you needed your mic on yeah my mic was off  okay man basil teas make it's ridiculous how good that is i'm so happy he's here really good 
[00:44:00]  i had my three egg omelet with with uh yellow yolk by the way of course you're gonna eat an egg  because if you're gonna eat an egg white it's very rare that i actually have eggs so if i'm gonna  i'm going all out  and opie thank you too off air you said you will invite me to your wedding of course i would  there was never a doubt but then patrice goes uh well if you invite me i guess i gotta go  no i didn't mean it like that at that point i just didn't think i just thought it'd be a way not 
[00:44:30]  to invite a lot of people because it'll just be too many i think you got in your life and i didn't  think i would be squeezing into that too many i would i would imagine norton anthony would be invited  all the family people um there's people in this room sona kenny there's people in this room that  aren't right i i i don't think i wouldn't think erock this is my personal feelings i wouldn't think  wow i wouldn't think any of the guys uh not fan um who i i don't think poe i don't think you 
[00:45:00]  invited poe i'm just steve i'm not even sure but i think steve would have to get an invite but he can  only bring himself and a date that you knew which is kind of two invites in a way like to get yes  somebody he knew like you have to approve his who he's bringing what about stunt brain uh  no because he's too new not a chance in hell because he's too new yeah i just don't think 
[00:45:30]  it would have happened i it would just be awkward you know what also you haven't if fan was still  here you haven't seen him out drinking yet which is bad because you can invite him he's a nice enough  guy and everything but he might be the angriest nastiest drunk and then you get him to the wedding  and all of a sudden he's just an ass and ruins everything yeah he turns into dustin hoffman at the  the end of the graduate i didn't i didn't think any any uh peripheral comedians other than norton  i didn't think we're gonna oh no no i'm just i'm just saying what i'm just saying he was worried 
[00:46:00]  man bob kelly will get the invite louis ck voss louis on the bubble uh  uh from the bubble boss would have to get an invite of course because he would commit suicide  why wasn't i and then that means bonnie's got an invite oh yeah because it's voss plus one now do  you feel do you see now what you're doing right now what you just did with bonnie yeah is what i was  thinking it would just be a very very very close wedding just because of that just because if you 
[00:46:30]  invite him and you invite this one and you know if you invite that one you got you know what i'm  saying and that's where i'm thinking that he wasn't gonna gonna do that just to save himself all of  that no i know what you do you put out a lot of last minute invites oh god some people already have  plans oh i got this figured out well voss didn't invite any of us he didn't invite his his his quote  unquote no his close friends 24 000 a year he didn't want to have a big wedding he had a hunting 
[00:47:00]  no no but let me be fair yeah but what's what was wrong with voss he didn't invite us to the  wedding which was in the middle middle of nowhere in canada jimmy uh went but then he invites us to  caroline's the comedy club here yeah in new york and he gets insulted because no one went because we  thought it was just him doing you know what he usually does but it was supposedly it was what a  huge reception he wanted he wanted the actual traditional he's still holding a grudge but he  wanted the traditional benefits without treating you as the friend that you get those benefits right 
[00:47:30]  he wanted the the presence so he says go go to the wedding thing at the lord and taylor and get my  stuff yeah but you're not a friend to be at the wedding it's called a registry now bobby did a genius  thing which is what we are the comics you're afraid of the you're afraid of the rejection  so you found a way for people to be there or not be there and you don't know it we had that wedding 
[00:48:00]  on the internet yeah the wedding on the internet genius to have it in a place where people he didn't  want to force people he go hey listen i'd like you to come to my wedding in hawaii and people go oh my  god why i can't do that when he did it on the internet it was it was genius dude i thought it  was genius he's able to be in paradise and then uh he uh makes everybody else watch on their computer  screen he didn't invite me one time to a barbecue because he thought i wouldn't go yeah i just not  thinking you just we you just don't want like your black friends to see that you hang out dude i have 
[00:48:30]  cookouts and there's nothing but crackers it it looks like and invite me i would go to one of your  cookouts cracker cookout it looks like a secret meeting of we're trying to be your friend i look  like a butler at my own house i have nothing but white friends a couple of black all my black  friends in boston i have a few black comic friends like keith and there's a couple of everybody else  is white but i would not think you would come yeah i was just that's the only reason i was also  insulted because there was something else and patrice goes well i didn't invite you because i didn't 
[00:49:00]  think you would come i'm like of course i would go we're trying to be your friend dude invite us to  stuff you'll be surprised we'll show up we have been promising to eat some type of lunch together  for years since 96 the staff is still waiting for their lunch when we came back on the interns  you know what patrice makes a good point really fast across from xm uh there's a place that used  to be called shelley steakhouse yeah and uh patrice and i and a few uh uh i believe our ladies were  there and a few other people after one of your saturday night radio shows we went and had a great 
[00:49:30]  dinner a late night steak dinner we had a a wonderful time and i remember even saying to  patrice we gotta do this more often let me tell you what has happened since that uh dinner but more  often shelley steakhouse moved a block or two away and in its place is a brand new 20 story building  that's how long it's been since we ate am i lying and it's occupied am i lying no they're just about 
[00:50:00]  done the crane is about to be uh dismantled because they are done with this building and  that was the last time we ate when it used to be a tiny little steak joint like a two three story  building i would i just it's just it's just when you invite somebody you want them to come you know  you just go it's embarrassing if people don't show up at something here's rich boss listen to this  boss hey what's going on uh well we're talking about weddings and stuff and uh i pointed out that  you're still holding a grudge because we didn't go to caroline's oh i don't i don't really hold a 
[00:50:30]  grudge now about that don't really hold a grudge what's a grush a grudge the wedding gifts i'm  what um still upset about yeah he's heard about that that he well well he does not understand why  it's a give and take thing you have to give the people understand why you have to give the people  some entertainment and and the ability to be there shut up a minute shut up and the ability to be at  your wedding you're like you wanted to have your wedding alone in some hunting lodge up in canada  and then come back down here and expect the scene from uh goodfellas where they're all handing over 
[00:51:00]  the envelopes it it doesn't work that way you don't understand that's the only reason we didn't even know  what it how can i think this is a traditional reception when when the wedding and the reception  happened you go hey you bum you can't come to the wedding yeah but please come to the thing where  you owe me something right no here's the deal you know what you're so first of all you're so close  minded and so uh self-centered you don't listen we've been arguing this thing with him for no but 
[00:51:30]  here's a couple years now he doesn't understand that let me no one knew boss boss yeah look no i'm  no no you it's me opie you're listen to me a hero first of all i probably would have uh went to  your wedding because i wasn't doing anything else in the middle of canada i probably would have taken  that trip just because i have a candid compliment that is i haven't seen a part of canada platypus  anyway right exactly and a mountie uh so i probably would have went with jimmy to be completely honest 
[00:52:00]  with you i was flying around the country with jimmy all the time what the hell i would have went to  your wedding but what the mistake you made which anthony is bringing up you didn't invite anyone to  the wedding you didn't have a traditional reception all of a sudden you kind of casually invite us to  go to caroline's i'm like he said he's at caroline's three days a week so you know what's different  about and he didn't call it a reception thank you you never explained that this was a special caroline's  thing where you actually rolled out a red carpet and stuff we didn't know so no one showed up 
[00:52:30]  and to this day voss is holding a we thought it was a party for the people he didn't invite like  that's what would have made everybody understand okay look he was in canada okay we thought it was  a regular party for people that he did that he told not to cut but he held an official reception  all you have to do is see why don't you say if you say something like okay you had the right  intentions but it didn't come out the way it was supposed to that's what we said to you for years now  yeah here's the thing because i had the intentions i don't want to make like i said it and i'll say it 
[00:53:00]  again i don't want to make people fly all why do you think we had bonnie didn't want here's another  thing i want you to be honest about bonnie didn't want us there bonnie didn't want us ruining her  canadian wedding man you know what you're so full of shit you know what hey oh sorry i'm just saying  i know i come on man cursing and everything shut up and let me talk this is real for voss okay this is  real god no listen i had the right intentions that i don't want people to fly all over all over 
[00:53:30]  the place why would i have a party in in l.a and one in new york let's say let's say everybody did go  to the wedding and i invited them why would i don't have a party one in new york and new york why would  you have a part why would you why would you have a party in in l.a why would you have a party in l.a  do you know you see where i'm going to go with this i don't care where you're going to go all right  where i'm going to go is your friends are not in l.a i didn't have friends here gullup wasn't in l.a  gullup who's that what's my friend i don't even you're naming guys who was in the first comedy 
[00:54:00]  strike the comedy strike of 79 didn't one of those guys jump off uh the hyatt hotel didn't get his way  look it up that's a great story uh boss wait no the mistake you made you didn't make it clear  that this was a reception you're like we're all we're thinking of just getting together caroline's  like i'll catch him next time he's at caroline's i also have here's the thing i have the uh the 
[00:54:30]  invitations i sent out that look exactly like any other i made a mistake i made a mistake by going  there and doing it that was a mistake i made because it still cost me a lot a lot of money  and i didn't get an invitation it was a it was a i heard it was a i heard boss was having a thing  and caroline's no you didn't you got an invitation i don't remember an invitation i'm sorry oh really  i i swear rich i'm not trying to make uh some fun radio here i really don't remember but wait but 
[00:55:00]  here's the thing i forgot about this i let this go a long time ago all right how how many people ended  up showing up at caroline's here in new york for your quote reception over 100 i just have to say  what what steve from basho is calling them bonnie and claude over 100 that's funny all right i couldn't  make the reception but you know all right who didn't make the reception i didn't jimmy didn't  patrice didn't who else jimmy was taping uh lucky louis but he he came to the party in la 
[00:55:30]  i yeah but i also was the best man and flew myself a nine-hour flight to scott scatchewa a  nine-hour flight a moose picking up at the airport they got their wedding pictures taken out of rest  area it was awful what is that about all right here's the thing you see that you just want to  feel comfortable huh rich you see the resentment that jimmy has for flying that far now if i invited  everybody i would have a hundred people go i would have a hundred people we flew uh uh whatever 
[00:56:00]  i'm not doing that but that's how we are though boss come on you you being angry right now this is a  really a thing i'm not being angry first of all this conversation came about boss because i with me and  opie was talking about coming to his wedding and i said look the way we all operate i just i didn't  think he was going to invite me to the wedding oh uh opie and i started naming who i didn't think he  would invite i thought it would just be too big of a thing and he would invite just very very close  people and i didn't think any of the comics other than norton from the show would get invited so your 
[00:56:30]  name came up and then this thing well boss is going to get invited it might be a little late but he's  going to get one what do you mean a little late what does that mean you know i'm i'm i'm getting my  list together it's it's taken longer than i thought oh brother you're cutting back on expenses no it's it's  a joke uh that goes back a few minutes a few minutes it was way back a couple of minutes 
[00:57:00]  no i i figured i figured out how to get out of an uncomfortable situation because there are a lot  of people you feel like you need to invite but you don't really want to be at the wedding so what you  do is you make sure they get their invite very late in the game and then they end up calling you  and they feel guilty like oh my god but i i have a trip and what's late maybe two weeks out  why don't you get one that's late yeah two weeks out yeah for your white friends or patrice 
[00:57:30]  like i don't plan that far i thought that i thought i was thinking more three days  what you don't understand is because you're opie yeah people just cancel their plans unless they  absolutely then it's got to be like five days that's sure why don't you just drop them off on  the way to the church yeah call them that morning i want the awkward call where i just got the invite  and and then i go that's weird i sent that out months ago what happened and then they go fans  find out where the wedding is and then they go uh well it's uh it's only five days from now and i 
[00:58:00]  don't know how to tell you this but i there's no way i'm gonna make it and then i have to make believe  i care like ah man i understand it's cool don't so i would have understood that's why i'm not saying it  like i would have understood not getting invited i understood not getting invited to boss as well  i just didn't appreciate the anger he had about this reception he was extremely angry at everybody  that i did not know was a reception patrice do you really think you would have flown uh uh up to  edmonton canada honestly no that's why i said i'm not upset that you didn't invite me to the wedding 
[00:58:30]  boss i really know i'm just upset but you shouldn't be upset that we didn't know it was a reception  right i'm upset that you you got traditional i think it's on the second half of the situation yeah yeah  well you know what a lot of people a lot of people have wedding parties and when people don't  go to the weddings you think i mean you think i don't know that what that's that's no a lot of  people have a wedding and a reception you know why you don't know that because you're too selfish  and self-centered to do any research who researches what what what does that mean google wedding 
[00:59:00]  possibilities yeah what is that what do you want us to spend some time on wikipedia making up wedding  crap what are you talking about how dare this boob tell me that i'm so too selfish to learn about  weddings i don't care what was the last time anyone learned about weddings you got married in canada  what's that's not selfish no you couldn't get married in connecticut i could have drove there  or at least buffalo keep it kind of why canada why canada why would i you know what you're right  i should have had her whole family moved to the states what about your side of the situation 
[00:59:30]  boss family i don't have i don't have that big of a family we're your family boss what's that  we're your family oh oh that that really hurts to think that you guys are my family we are your  family yeah we are this is all you got we're all you got this is it we love you yeah this is it  this is it i have no comeback for this isn't that great we're now this is exactly it talking a man into  suicide today i want to bring up uh anthony and norton if you go to the message boards about you 
[01:00:00]  know they're giving me college tips for my daughter one i i realized neither of you went to college  college ship college tips oh tips oh tips i thought there was a like some kind of cruise ship for college  kids college tips i said yes college tips college tips and realizing that neither one of us went to  college yes or have kids a lot of people agreeing with uh voss's uh philosophy because voss wants to 
[01:00:30]  uh have his kid go to community college for a couple years then maybe go to a huge university  he wants to save a few bucks exactly well with tuition how it is it's hard to beat him up about  why don't you just say your kids are going to the 13th and 14th grade yep that's what i said that's it  community college is is failure because you have to have a kid or uh have gone to college to know  what's good for uh well yeah you know to make decisions and stuff like that oh wow you're falling 
[01:01:00]  apart does your tongue swell up at night when you sleep voss put some ice on it  voss has a uh anterior cruciate ligament tear in his mouth  what did he what did he say  are you  are you sucking on salt  my phone my phone is my phone is in your mouth 
[01:01:30]  you're supposed to hold it to your ear you don't put the whole phone in your mouth and talk rich  his phone's only good to 30 fathoms it's already soaking wet oh he has a rotator cuff  injury and it's inside of his mom yes get your thing together boss yeah we don't care if you  can send it where you watch because you want to go to a bigger college but rich talked to her in a  community college and and why did you do that see this is it's so why who does that you know what  i think it into a two-year nonsense college i hate to tell you though it's logical because 
[01:02:00]  tuition is ridiculous people are getting bankrupt over trying to send their uh  kids to like a huge university personally i think college is a a waste of your time  that's what i say all it ever did was mess up my credit and it does nothing all it does is teach  people how to be having credit problems and it teaches people of different ethnic groups how to  sleep with each other like that would have never been able to oh good a mongolian and a jamaican  they met in college that's about it it's a hell of a party though for four years five years it's 
[01:02:30]  just nonsense i don't i think most most people you know what college teaches people how to work for  other people it doesn't teach it destroys dreams if you have any dream like if anybody in here right  now if they went to college and or if you talk to somebody that thought about college you would not  be doing what you're doing if you go hey listen i want to be a successful radio person somebody go  you're a jerk go to go to college but college does not do anything to help you better yourself no 
[01:03:00]  nothing well because i think a lot of people they just assume well if i go to college that's all i  have to worry about i'll be successful then you get out of college and someone's waiting there to  give you a job and everything that's the first step then you have to when you're in college really  then you got to work for the college yes fifty thousand dollars or seventy five dollars you got to pay  back you essentially you're going to work for the college for the next ten years you're a you're a  hoe for the college not taking back they're pimping you out all over the place yeah sit in the community  college they're there they always try to get me to go back to geneseo because you know i've been 
[01:03:30]  quite successful and they have a communications program up there they want me to go back and talk  i'm like no you guys did nothing for me nothing they really didn't do anything i don't even get that  alumni the best i got was they happen to have a uh a radio station and and i spent all my time at the  radio station i didn't learn this in in school i didn't learn this in class you should say that  with that tone i told the story yesterday i was gonna uh fell out so i went to my communications uh 
[01:04:00]  professor and i said look you got to give me a a a higher grade or i'm flunking out he goes ah  maybe this isn't uh you know uh what you're gonna be doing with your life maybe you're not cut out to  do this i'm like oh thanks a lot you ass and then i reminded him of what happened to his daughter  at the fraternity house uh a few years back oh oh and then i uh went on to another professor and he  gave me the uh the grade that i needed and i was able to continue my college career so i could work  at the radio station which leads to what i'm doing today which not the classroom crap and the fact is 
[01:04:30]  you got all your on job training on the job you learned doing what you wanted to do college stinks  i went to one semester i got a b in three s did you really yeah but i dropped out of high school  because of rehab so i didn't have a high school diploma so i was taking college slash high school  credits i took in college i took biology i took biology western civilization problems and statistics

[01:06:00]  get that concept don't you want to get to the point where they're all out of the house why would  you go back in time you basically go back in time they're out of the house you turn your 18 i know  but you turn your 18 year old into a newborn that doesn't make sense you were finally ready to just  right not have to deal with anything with children anymore and now you uh started all over  it's called love hey boss uh where are you gonna be tonight where are you gonna be tonight because 
[01:06:30]  we've got a break how many cove springfield i'm not hanging up on you i don't do that with  plugs he did get it out quick though you're mad springfield new jersey what's the club comedy  cove comedy cove tonight with rich voss who's uh terrific to see for real i really don't have any  any resentment or anger towards this whole wedding thing anymore i made a mistake it was a complete  misunderstanding he had resentment and anger yeah yes wow oh he came in here on fire one day yelling  and screaming i'm like well chill dude we didn't even know it was a reception you're not the only one 
[01:07:00]  that made a mistake i made a mistake i went it wasn't it was kind of fun it was actually look here's  the deal you assume too much because i would have went to the to your wedding you know i i think people  don't want to ask people to go to their wedding because they don't want to put them in that  position but that's what i was telling patrice that started this whole thing i'm like of course  you're gonna get an invite but if you call me go i don't really feel like going or it's not my place  i would be totally cool with that that's fine but i i do want you there i'm not rsvp i don't know 
[01:07:30]  let me tell you how detached i am from it in terms of that i don't even know how to feel  for you at a way like i don't know this room knows how to feel i don't know what somebody has to  tell me how to feel at a wedding i i guarantee we can line up and put our hands on uh on that hot  plate over there and not one of us will scream we just don't feel anything like feels like hey  man i'm so happy like yeah you're supposed to be like happy for people you're supposed to um get 
[01:08:00]  caught up in the joyous moment of their happiness and love and then uh during at the receiving line  at the end when you're shaking hands with the family and and uh you're supposed to actually  say congratulations and really feel it patrice patrice is making this cringe but i innately  don't support marriage for the guy's point of view meaning if i saw you get married i'd be like boy one  soldier down and i just think it's medic it's for the woman i'm usually not going to be her friend  so it was you more happy for her you would need to be more happy for her than right man but i i can 
[01:08:30]  care less about you know what i mean like if i marry my girl it's just it's really going to be  here you go but you're looking at see you're looking at the whole thing very cynically you're  not looking at it in terms of love two people sharing a life believe me i ain't either but you  know that's how it is i don't mean with you personally i'm not talking about you no i'm talking  about general overall percentage i'm telling you to shut up because you're heading this way what 
[01:09:00]  yeah what it is whirlwind jack it is it is a 6.8 who are you kidding this isn't 2007 i would i would  believe every word you're saying what you're in a whole different world my friend i do you're you're  heading toward the altar something you said you would never do again why can't two people uh  look i don't want to put the pressure on two movies in mind i don't know my big fat wap wedding  and and knocked up and knocked up is the first feature 
[01:09:30]  knocked up followed by my big fat wap wedding i had to stop you because  all i'm saying is let's let's uh let's uh talk in in early fall early fall yeah we're only and it's  some we're only 24 days into anthelini but something is going on with you a lot of bets going on yeah  really yeah there's something going on with you and jill that you that is confusing the hell out 
[01:10:00]  of how you think it depends on the couple like i'm actually happy for openers girl because they  get along like they're four years i mean it's a long it's not a pressure thing it's like this is  what i'm saying marriage i mean he i guess he wants to get married like you gotta want to get married but  it's like if i marry my girl it really is for her like almost 99.9 but you're not saying anything  crazy though i think i think like it's like you went through what you've gone through here you go  here's your stripe but you're not a stripe you're not saying anything crazy i think uh girls you know 
[01:10:30]  since they're very very little that it's all about their wedding day as a guy growing up did you ever  have a discussion with your dad about ever getting married or any of that you don't have a discussion  about love right that's what i'm saying yeah but as much as you're not you're against it you should  be four you should be neutral what's the big deal whether you do or don't because she takes  look i'm it's just she's in your life it's official and it's hard to get her out like you can't just  say leave patrice if you go to consequence if you go to my wedding you're going to see that's a 
[01:11:00]  little different it's going to be you know certainly a celebration but we're going to have  fun we're going to have a party are you reading your own vows uh-oh uh-oh that's kind of hack  yeah but that's what a wedding is i do why not just get married under the why not get married  just no i mean people and god what would happen to that that would be cool yeah on a beach  somewhere like braveheart just go out in the woods do it do it do it do it how spencer christian did it 
[01:11:30]  to the tahitian girl when he was hiding from captain blight maria under a burning tree  you guys attacked bobby he didn't invite people to hawaii we already we covered that  yeah he was a smarter chiseler than you yeah it was very smart for him to do that because it was  he was protecting but you were doing it too you were protecting your ego because you didn't want 
[01:12:00]  to invite i don't know i'm not going to stay there and say you wanted to invite me but you didn't want  people to turn you down which is what you what people don't want your life experience everyone has  rejected you i mean patrice here's the thing i invited you i invite when i had that dumb that  dumb party for my i love that dude i'm i appreciate look i'm not mad you didn't invite me i'm just my  thing a list if you can listen is that i didn't i didn't know what that party was i didn't know that  i was supposed to be bringing i thought it was just i have a party i didn't know you paid he paid 
[01:12:30]  thousands of dollars to goofy carolines oh boy did he they should have paid you by the way all  the help uh you've given them and these wedding cupcakes that he had not to trust carolines  because you know they do the right thing but maybe they should have thrown uh vasa bone and said  maybe they did i don't know what kind of they give you a deal at all rich no of course not oh look at  right yeah i guess they are some yeah they allowed me to headline we didn't know rich i wouldn't  have came and not get you so i'm gonna get you i'll get you something because you're a friend of 
[01:13:00]  mine but that that reception i didn't know what it was that's okay so i i i i agree i make i made  it we made a big mistake and i talk about that all the time that we made a big mistake which  sir i just feel bad because they were probably hoping to see more faces yeah familiar faces and  they just weren't there because we we there was a misunderstanding that's what it really was  it wasn't that dumb we love you boss now get lost beat it so be scram you think you'll cry during  the reading of the uh like the he'll cry oh uh hey chill out man uh i'm in the middle of a brew 
[01:13:30]  weekend and you had to ask that question he'll cry you think you might uh there's another reason  probably but i'm gonna cry with obama becomes president i i thought about it like i'm pitching  oh get out of here anthony yeah believe me we'll both be crying i'm gonna cry i think i'm i'm just  gonna cry is that like because i've seen old footage of uh when martin luther king was  assassinated a lot of black people stand around the televisions and times square and stuff just 
[01:14:00]  crying yeah you think that's gonna be the same type of emotional moment where first black president  all right listen this could be 20 minutes we gotta take a break butterflies when you said that we  gotta take a break we get into this after the break we're 15 minutes after a break listen uh and  really fast just uh just to wrap this up nice uh patrice the first saturday night radio show you  did was march 11th 06 thank you eroc it used to be called bitch management and we went out to dinner  after that over two years ago over two years ago when we said wow this is so nice we should do this

[01:17:00]  begins is you don't like do you like superhero movies it depends you would like the how what they  did with batman i haven't i think it's the best they got rid of all that cartoony ever made they  got rid of all that cartoony crap broke it down and started all over man my favorite new superhero  movie going to be coming out soon called opi it's amazing thank you anthony just want to remind  people if uh you're just tuning in the daily news of course got it uh correct uh this morning for 
[01:17:30]  once headline radio show host opi talks listener out of suicide attempt oh you might have heard oh  wow listen to the music you might have heard differently if you were listening to our show  yesterday but uh you know the paper we always say it the paper is never wrong never radio show host  opi talks listener out of suicide attempt is that your superpower to talk people out of suicide yeah  like they're playing the the superman yeah that's his uh my super powers that keep you from slitting  your wrist that's his superpower and the picture was it was it was just me and uh yeah and and the 
[01:18:00]  banner behind me just said opi they even cut out the anthony part of the banner yeah they cut out uh  half the banner just a picture of opi and it said opi saves man from suicide it's like what the hell  were me and jimmy doing they should have showed opi just being calm and collected and then you and me  hugging like two frightened girls in the background scared not able to speak hugging with one leg raised  just terrified of the storm well while the calm cool collected storm master calmed everybody 
[01:18:30]  stupid newspaper uh break down the wall now they never get anything right yeah i mean jimmy you know  it's not fair to jimmy jimmy was like instrumental in what was going on yesterday well i came out with  the famous phrase but don't do that right hey hey what are you what are you crazy come on what is  this about so uh the happening looks like it's not happening yeah of course not sounds horrendous well  and anthony what did the paper say about that well the papers the paper said uh look i'm going to give 
[01:19:00]  away a spoiler uh to the uh movie um so if anybody know this is what the newspaper said jimmy don't turn  your dial trust me yeah don't don't worry it's not a spoiler i wouldn't i wouldn't give you a spoiler  we won't have we won't have with you it's actually a pretty funny line this is how the newspaper put it  in the review it said i'm going to give you a spoiler so if you don't want a spoiler don't read the rest  of the article and he goes the twist at the end of the movie is there is no twist to the end of the  movie there is nothing it is just the happening or the end of story uh happening the happening it's 
[01:19:30]  just a ridiculous about doesn't make any sense movie it's about death right or something is about  people just apparently something happens where people start killing themselves that's that's the  gist of the movie they're not sure some kind of toxic wait wait wait wait you just said the movie the  happening has something happening no it's the happening did you see it and then what's happening  is the prequel right and surely hemfel raises the question of course i have no watching this thing 
[01:20:00]  and i'm going there's just it's a lot of imagery of people floating and dying but they they're killing  themselves risen up against against this guy anyway they're done with yeah public has  all night shamalan stinks they're done can we make it official that he was a one-hit wonder  i six cents but how come this was good he was going to be the next uh marty scorsese this is  where racism lives yeah oh it's all about why why doesn't this uh whatever he is m night 
[01:20:30]  m night why does he shamalan a ding-dong another 20 years to stink just like kevin costner he will  he's got 20 movies what are you talking about this guy this is this is it this is it though  like they said that after the village they said that after the one with the mermaid  yeah lady in the water lady in the water this one is over because they because they  this is m night shot this is his first rated r movie y'all and it's gonna stink who's he had  who's had that many bombs in a row now kevin costner kevin costner are you including things like water 
[01:21:00]  world and the postman as like bad movies his what's weird about that he also won an oscar  here's what's weird about kevin costner all right and his stinkiness okay the ones that really stink  are actually all right water i like water world doesn't bug me neither does the postman see but he  was in bombs that's the thing it's money with hollywood it's not artistic flavor it's it's it's the bottom  line and bottom line kevin costner hasn't been top of the line for a long time he still gets based on 
[01:21:30]  uh dances with wolves right he's a made man because that's almost like eastwood which his  films are okay that he direct but even if they weren't great people wouldn't hurt eastwood because  he's eastwood exactly has that past too because he wanted eastwood's a little bit more boutique  than uh than kevin costner meaning he comes out with one every 16 years and he gets an oscar yeah yeah  he's like he's like the directing uh daniel day lewis daniel day lewis crawls in on under a rock 
[01:22:00]  and then comes out and it's like you have to give him an oscar but they have no choice he he becomes  like this amazing dude all right here's the deal the six cents made uh 293 million there you go that  was his top one and then unbreakable uh made 95 let's call it 95 million i didn't mind unbreakable  either i really didn't mind that movie unbreakable could have been great he blew it could have been  out uh bruce willis sam jackson it was a he was an evil villain but it was all regular guys yeah 
[01:22:30]  they were super it was like almost like this hancock thing yeah i thought that was pretty good  didn't have super pop he had these vague implied superpowers bruce willis okay and sam sam jackson  was his nemesis but only sam jackson knew it yeah i didn't know it until the end one of those twists  it could have been a great movie uh signs was signs i didn't know yeah signs almost did uh as well as  six cents uh it got it got ridiculous and hokey and stuff but but he didn't mind 228 mil for that 
[01:23:00]  what happened with six cents doing 293 so that was close what happened at the end of signs  richard dreyfuss got on the ship that's not signs oh it was no such a humor about mistakes  his what are you stupid his his finger glowed and he said he'd be right here  i'll tell you they uh i'll tell you they solved the uh the problem with lorraine 
[01:23:30]  that's not the goddamn ending they they flew a flying saucer in the mothership yep and and hit it  with a virus virus and uh and all the little ships that were on earth at the time yeah they dismantled  because the mothership brought him down remember randy quaid had that great line he's good oh  there was such good so many great lines in that movie oh by the way opie was right it was the rain  right it rained or something and that was it yeah water water they came to a planet to take over that  seventy five percent toxic which is kind of silly that's what pissed me off it's aliens they figure 
[01:24:00]  out how to get to earth and and they're gonna take over the planet they're real smart how to build  umbrellas yeah thank you jimmy that's what it was you think the aliens would have just walked  around with umbrellas it's like if you were going to take over a planet and you have the capability  of doing so would you take over a planet that seventy five percent of the planet is covered with  something that kills you on contact wow no yeah and then could you hit that please okay no no no 
[01:24:30]  there you go oh i don't know what you mean oh okay yeah jimmy had a little doozy there all  righty that would have got us fired so we proverbial lulu okay uh then signs was followed up by the  village uh drastic drop off i don't get 114 million for that movie and then lady in the water he hasn't  had enough bombs to throw him away yet but he's not a white guy story stupid lady in the water how 
[01:25:00]  dumb there's a lady in the water she's got shut up and the village stunk joaquin phoenix and his  hair lip he's terrible he's terrible i can't get past hair lips him and stay hair lips i have to cover  my eyes and watch this now torn up side of your lip thing they should be forced to always deliver  their dialogue behind an open newspaper no matter what they're talking about wait a minute you know  who got that lip that i've never noticed his whole career i'm lost eric roberts yeah does he yeah he 
[01:25:30]  got that lip i didn't realize that to him cleft palate no it's a cleft lip so out the nose i think  lady in the water thing a hair lip is a cleft palate that's been repaired oh is that what it is  yeah yeah why don't they repair it better i don't know what do they do just staple it i honestly don't  know they don't have that one figured out yet jimmy put some vitamin e oil on that some aloe get  some aloe in it they've never done a good job with those things oh my god what the hell do you  know about vitamin e hey i just know it's good for scars that's awful they never fix them properly 
[01:26:00]  i didn't think white people knew about them you said cocoa butter i would have passed down yeah lady  in the water just uh finished this 42 million a massive bomb yeah and now they're happening not  not getting uh good reviews this morning lady in the water it's like a it's like a little boy's  story that's not a good title it's not mysterious and i gotta do a little f you to mark walberg because  uh we had a great time with him he's uh called our show a couple times and he's kind of a friend of  the show it went so well we're like mark uh next time you're in new york you really need to come in

[01:46:00]  i'm i'm a season ticket holder she never did any skating my friend i was never skating right  oh here she'd walk around the ice and and what no she walked around the nassau coliseum  and uh every guy would turn their head they would need a chiropractor as she walked by and that's not  a joke and then you would watch everyone's date to the uh the game yeah get really pissed off because  the dudes were checking out jill as she uh just worked the crowd and could you do she was great  actually that's what yeah that's what it was her job she was great at yes can you do me a huge favor

[01:47:00]  of opian anthony and channel 11 traffic reporter jill nicolini is well real i love how you wrote that  is well pause real a website antholini.com has been created to track the romance after looking at the  pictures of the happy couple the upside of this merger of media titans is that it gives  single guys who might look like the married guy at the top of the opposite page hope  just saying and you were the guy at the top of the opposite page yeah it's the billy joel syndrome 
[01:47:30]  yeah what's that driving into a house that is awful what's the billy joel syndrome  it's several whatever her name is this guy's getting a little too comfortable yeah and you know  what that is such a that is such a you women don't think like us we don't need to say that  that's true patrice richard you don't want us uh going back to hating you trust me  stop getting comfortable with our radio no man the hot girls will a lot of times just go with  guys who get them in a different way you're right they don't think like us that is right 
[01:48:00]  christy brinkley and billy joel billy joel's gift was bigger than her hot but that is  but that is that's what i'm saying is that is that we have to come with her her prettiness for some  reason has is is matching his establishment as a man but but for real it's not it's not  most hot girls like we're in high school most hot girls date the hot jocks they don't date  funny guys again i know there's exceptions but the majority of the time is in high school you probably 
[01:48:30]  i know i didn't it's almost like the i bang girls way out of my league only because i'm funny and because  that's you know and i'm not knocking anthony anthony's brilliant but it's his thank you jimmy  that that and she obviously thinks he's cute and she likes him and she thinks he's handsome  but it's not like oh my god tell you that yes really silly look at anthony just looking down  and when you unrolled it for the first time does she go what what and you untied it from around  your waist we did a whole bit on the the presentation of it and richard sorry you have 
[01:49:00]  to be burdened with uh with with uh the other people in the studio too as opposed to just open  we apologize that you have to hear oh yeah yeah with the hero wait before we move on to me being a  hero i don't write the headline well you know what let's not tell everybody because i want to assume  that you did write the headline and that you were very accurate uh richard so you said it gives hope  to guys like you but you're married so are you hoping to dump your wife i said guys who look like  me public service announcement i love my wife i'm very happily married all of this is done to ingrate 
[01:49:30]  myself with you i'm just here for the last guys all right so you're you were shocked when you found  out that this was a real thing huh well you know according to jill it's real she uses that l word all the  time now you're saying according to see so you still think what it's a bit no i never said that  okay i never said what what is the um what's the idea that if it was fake what is the idea behind the  fakeness oh i've heard on message boards i've read things like it's uh mutual publicity for this 
[01:50:00]  program and for uh channel 11 uh uh the cw 11 news um it's jill trying to get publicity for herself  it's me trying to get publicity for myself it's like yeah it's like i wonder where they got that  idea from maybe the thousand pictures that we all had a leaf through in the first 24 days of your  relationship she likes taking a lot of pictures and and uh she photographs very well does it bother  you at all pictures the constant pictures oh i think they're great we were in different places 
[01:50:30]  we're all having fun does it bother you the constant photographers going sir could you step out of  the way could you take this picture i had that happen once at the tavern on the green it was  christmas and this couple got up and uh there was a big christmas tree there and a couple got up and  they have a camera and they walked over and go uh uh would you mind taking a picture and i was like 
[01:51:00]  okay so i stand up and they handed me the camera i thought they wanted to take a picture with me i was  feeling all good about myself like oh they they listen to the show she goes oh would you mind  taking a picture i'm like yeah no problem so i stand up and they handed me the camera it was very  embarrassing you fix your collar first you know i always yeah well i looked at the people at the  table like oh here it comes you know oh boy a hassle why can't they leave me alone while i'm eating  it's the worst when that happens samey that makes that embarrassing my family do you think of those 
[01:51:30]  awful pal talk girls and go god how could i ever had no no i'll tell you there are a couple of pal  talk girls that are stunning what yeah there are a couple that are stunning the majority of them  jill is a different level punched in the face that's right she's a different level of pretty though  huh she's a different level yeah oh yeah no no that's a whole different uh you know hey richard  it's a whole different thing too you're a reporter internet thing maybe you could get something out 
[01:52:00]  of anthony we can you're a reporter ask him the tough questions where is the relationship leading  do you believe in marriage again you always said you didn't want to have kids is that still true  come on richard let's get into this hard hitting well you need her dad in here for that  wouldn't he be better at this yeah that's true that's true i mean is he grilling you on that anthony  um yeah a little bit anthony is the same age as a father i am not they hang out his father fell  in love with anthony when they started reminiscing about the ray robinson fight 
[01:52:30]  they were criticizing raising ball it didn't happen that way the way i remember it that darky sure can  move yeah well you know a couple of italians they smoke unfiltered cigarettes together and they're  cute when they're young that's italians trying to be like politically correct  richard oh god damn yeah  i remember hearing that as a kid that's very accurate right uh uh richard anything else before 
[01:53:00]  we let you go no i'm all good i want to thank you for the headline today radio show host opie talks  listener out of suicide attempts you got it very accurate my friend you know if you read the story  it doesn't say that yeah well who why bother reading the story when the headline says it all  though you're right um i just uh i just want to say richard maybe a few of these pictures should  find their way into uh the paper i think being the long island power couple that we are or rubbish  couple as some people have called us how much attention do you need why would you want them in the 
[01:53:30]  paper if this wasn't for publicity well it's not because i think people should know uh and and see  that there uh are successful broadcasting people here in the area that are uh in love and out there  and you guys just you guys have have uh well wait this is definitely this is this is what's where this  is groundbreaking yes it is it's ground it's groundbreaking do you have a public relations 
[01:54:00]  guy working on this uh no no no isn't that odd not yet not yet you're the biggest media couple since  kidey and maury that's a good one now do you catch these upper echelon like the weather girls and and  maybe the you know are they looking at you differently um i don't know i really haven't uh i've i've been to  a few functions and parties where i've met some of the people there over at cw 11 and uh other other

[01:58:30]  how does that make you feel okay where do you even find these people i've not they're everywhere  orbitcast.com went with the story it was on the front page it was it was right there it was the top  story and uh people couldn't get get into the comments section fast enough oh i would never  read their car who cares my three guys let them say what they want bunch of dopes yeah of course they  are they just embarrassed themselves because if you know anything about this show everyone knows this  tom guy has been calling us for well over a year uh thousands of people met him at the the virus show 
[01:59:00]  last uh summer when he came out on stage with a cane yeah because he's at that point where he's not  walking too well his his color was awful people were like oh my god this this is real bad shape  they didn't even know until they saw him live yep and he always said when it got uh too bad he would  call our show up and end his life and i and i told him like when he called me to the day and i said look  do it this time because we have more listeners but that wasn't a bit that was just 
[01:59:30]  you know man and you know he he called our bluff because he called yesterday with guns in front of  them so your superpowers how long do they usually work when you stop a suicide i've been having fun  with that this morning but uh to get serious jimmy was amazing yesterday jimmy i i'm like i froze  because also i'm like because we just knew that he was serious and and at any second he could be  pulling a trigger well steve and it was the weirdest feeling to have like oh my god this guy might just 
[02:00:00]  pull the trigger right now i'm actually glad steve told us because we might have teased him a little bit  not because steve said he's got a gun a loaded gun he's holding a weapon um and it was you know we  kind of knew that before we talked to him so it was like we kind of went into it we all i mean kind  of knew it was a problem and he started talking like hey look uh you know you guys made me promise  and we just believed them like it wasn't we met the guys really physically and he was talking in the  past tense like look this is it you guys gave i had a lot of fun yeah had a lot of fun and i want to 
[02:00:30]  thank you guys and you're right it's not always about you yeah exactly and the pauses in there  were killing me because you didn't know it somewhere in that pause was going to be a gun shot yeah the  gun the gun did go off but he's like unloading hitting a shot you didn't hear this yet i i'll  promote uh orbitcast.com because they have the whole uh the whole bit up there all the audio and  everything but then anthony was talking to him about hey why don't you unload those guns and don't what  did you say anthony because i think that was i said yeah i said why don't you unload the guns i go take 
[02:01:00]  out the magazine and don't you don't i said don't unload it out the barrel and uh i think the  suicide hotlines congratulate themselves after they uh on monday when they keep somebody from killing  something they're like yeah they sit there and go wow listen to this this is this replay i was  amazing on that particular moment or if they put less effort in if it's quarter to five and they  have a movie to go to yeah i'm not doing too well hey look i mean we're all gonna see each other  then anybody text the guy to make sure he's still alive and then he's uh uh the unfortunately 
[02:01:30]  because the gun went off that means you know cops got to get involved you can't just do that without  the the cops having to take a look-see and uh they brought him to a hospital and that's all we know  right now i hope he's okay wait the gun went off oh yeah do we have that audio i didn't shoot him  but he was taking the gun the bullet he forgot he had one in the chamber  seriously uh live on our show yesterday i believe you i'm i hear the thing i just didn't i just didn't  hear that why would it be ready to go today why you got it okay patrice listen not through the barrel 
[02:02:00]  just you know pull out the mag and uh get the get the round out of the chamber whoops hello yeah i'm here  what was that oh uh it was one in the chamber that was you just fired your what was that the 380  no it's another it was a uh it was another nine millimeter walter that was yesterday 
[02:02:30]  always forget about that one in the pipe and that's how close it was that's how close it was  he could have did an oofs and at what point did you say hey take care of yourself you know don't  don't kill yourself now you gotta go bye bye no we we shoved him off to a doctor that we knew yeah  we waited to we had a doctor and then we were able to kind of say all right uh tom uh stay on the line  someone wants to talk to you a doctor to give him a little hope because you never know then they sent 
[02:03:00]  the cops over there and then they sent the cops over there and um you know and now he's in a hospital  now let me ask you a moral i don't know much about this this is uh and let's um you know i'm  very racial but suicide is a very white person thing and i'm just saying i've never dealt with it  in my life in terms of that because you guys don't don't live a lot uh long enough to have a chance  to kill yourself are you kidding me our misery on this earth i i know a hundred years old is like  teenagers for um white people but let me ask you is it my civic duty to stop you from killing yourself is 
[02:03:30]  it that's a moral duty we talked about that before too you know morally who we to say you  just figure wouldn't wouldn't you want to though like i guess like we've all been depressed i mean  i don't know i mean i've certainly thought about it so it's like when you see someone else kind of  in that place like i know it kind of would pull me off the ledge at given moments honestly honestly  it's just not up to us i'll be honest with you i was just thinking about my job really yeah i don't  care that didn't even occur to me honest to god i just was thinking if he did it live on our show we 
[02:04:00]  would be fired and i really couldn't live with that i don't only if you coached if you try to  coach someone i don't know him well enough i don't think you've been fired if if you if he did it but  maybe if you said might have been do it well that's just it they'd have they'd have listened to every  single word leading up to that if he would have shot himself and because we were joking around  uh to some extent they would have said well perhaps you guys were responsible you're not 
[02:04:30]  professionals you shouldn't have done this you should have gotten professional help you should  have should have should whatever but why wouldn't you care that's weird i mean i i don't know the  guy well either but uh that's a that's a biggie man no i don't know him well enough  i uh i just think it's like one of those things where you know take him or leave him as far as he's  alive i think okay that's good better than being dead but honestly i don't know jimmy would you care 
[02:05:00]  yeah of course only because man not that i'm you know so compassionate i run around  couldn't hurt a fly it's spooky to be that close though it's a guy who you know is looking to you  for something yeah it's almost like he didn't reach out accidentally he gave entertainment because  i did my part we have a connection made him laugh see we we do have a connection with tom this whole  radio thing has become like a like a community an ona community and we're i don't know we're  quote the leaders and we do have this uh this bond with him so yeah it would have it would have 
[02:05:30]  creeped me out for a really long time it's a weird i wouldn't say it wouldn't have been creepy  would have been a creeped out thing you're right but as far as actually as a human being caring  i i i this is a fine line i'm treading a fine line here you're being careful i understand i don't  work here i i will say i i would i watch a lot of things trying to care a dude that i barely know 
[02:06:00]  committing suicide the thing that would bother me is the the creepiness of thank you the closeness to  that situation right but other than that the him thank you no that's what i'm saying i would have  been creeped out it would have been shocking i would have maybe had a nightmare about it or something  but the actual caring about him as a human and that part affecting me nope well some things are  just awful like look at 9-11 like personally i did not know anyone who died in 9-11 right i did that 
[02:06:30]  that i didn't but you attach you know what suicide is personal yeah so you you don't go oh that could  be me now you do go man i've been suicidal before but what makes you disconnect from that is goes i  didn't do it so anybody who kills themselves you go man i could have killed myself last week i found  out i was gonna lose a big toe or something yeah i could have just said forget it once the once the toe  go your knee go so yeah but tom's way past losing a toe yeah he's really sick he's like at the end of 
[02:07:00]  his life but it's personal it's personal that's and that's what depresses the hell 9-11 you had  empathy for because it was like oh my god first of all can you imagine being there right suffering  like that we were being attacked uh two iconic buildings uh coming down and that actually had  an emotional impact on people just the fact that you know two buildings fell down and it was you know  shocking for everybody the people were dying these horrific deaths that they didn't want to  did you feel bad for heath ledger or or kurt cobain there you go i'm not comparing did you feel bad 
[02:07:30]  i did for richard yeah of course i knew him and also because he's a comic and you know comics a lot  of comics are very depressed and to be as brilliantly funny as he was but hurting so badly that he did  that except on our show well yeah he had a better place but i mean you know he was a great comedian  man and to put a bullet in his head and i had that connection to him like oh man i'm i wish i knew  you know you had to connect because he was the comic but the the act it's like the act of killing 
[02:08:00]  yourself is just such a thing where it's like it's it's a selfish thing man it is but i think that  we've almost put too much selfishness on it it is selfish but it is difficult to do to actually to be  so mad or so sad that you actually yeah wipe yourself thank you yeah because tom really is the  ultimate punishment tom doesn't want to die he feels like he's run out of choices he's physically in pain  he's basically said that every day is like he's he said basically every day is like he feels like  he's drowning it's like hell it's it's hell well that's where kevorkian comes in where it's like 
[02:08:30]  is he is he how do you govern it's almost like i gotta you get a ticket for a seat belt it's like  thank you sir for yeah forcing me to take care of myself you know like maybe if you want to die you  could die agreed we're running out of show i want to do a speed round here uh a couple people  mentioning that anthony just gave the definition of a uh sociopath oh i did yes i think i'm a  realist my friend and then and then we got two quick things hopefully to bring some laughter back 
[02:09:00]  into this uh derek and sam with a uh hero update say goodbye as the king and queen of long island  trash are yesterday's news interest has completely fizzled and died on anthony and a new story has  captured the minds and hearts of america opie of radio's the opie show took a break recently from  telling jokes to save a life and uh i want to say guys entertained me for quite a bit what's the 
[02:09:30]  matter i i just was gonna say uh goodbye while sidekick anthony joked about guns and traffic girls  courageously talked the listeners down from the edge in one of radio's most emotional and uplifting  moments of all time tom let's uh let's uh call some people for you new york newspapers were calling  opie a hero this week even with the stress of carrying a radio show on his shoulders opie was  able to accept the compliment with modesty and class look what can i tell you you guys are you're 
[02:10:00]  you're in front of greatness we're players you certainly are i'm a hero for the common man and  you're lucky to be around me our sources are telling us that opie will spend the weekend visiting  children's hospitals and helping the homeless could a nobel peace prize be next as the hours  continue we'll keep you updated on the life and times of a real life superhero opie as for the  anthelini story meh oh that's funny man good job sam and steve and uh derek that's funny did you almost 
[02:10:30]  cry yesterday i i was i was frozen i really i i sounded sad though it did it was it sounds sad it  was unbelievable i uh i i i kind of was mad at myself when i went home i'm like why didn't i say  more why didn't i do more like jimmy was jimmy was really good yesterday i just know enough people have  done it i just froze you know a lot of people that they go through with it and it's just you know 
[02:11:00]  whatever and then um the boys came up with this like i said a speed around here  greg opie hughes a hero for our time why don't you say thanks in person though this is just kind  of it's kind of a stupid way to go out i mean you can't hold off for a couple of days it's not  like it's gonna be 300 degrees tomorrow i mean why can't you hold on for a couple of days there's  no reason to not hold on when peril is imminent obie will step in why don't you come into the 
[02:11:30]  studio not with the guns obviously but i mean seriously why don't you come in tomorrow um and  we'll see what we can do to get a couple of broads down for stepping up when no one else would for  acting the hero well how about this is there any way like we have a tremendous platform here that  somebody we have doctors that listen or whatever that knows anything that maybe you're not getting  enough stuff like maybe because you have insurance and they're not giving you the proper treatment  maybe somebody who knows more could suggest something or recommend something that would 
[02:12:00]  make your quality of life a lot better for standing before the power of hell greg opie hughes  we're off there would you give travis your number  your address or anything creepy i don't want to get out oh my god  in contact greg opie hughes our hero  oh jeez thank you oh thank you someone else getting it right around here thank you fantastic  thank you that is a prime example of what happened thank you

[02:18:00]  that border on offensive uh in order to entertain their office i refuse to sit here and think that  radio has to be nice why why does radio out of any other medium have to be nice we are being now held to  a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good go screw radio bad boys opie and anthony 
[02:18:30]  controversial radio personalities opie and anthony infamous dj's opie and anthony talk show radio  host opie and anthony opie and anthony opie and anthony radio shock jocks opie and anthony  i want to be called the a-man like you're the high man i'll be the a-man how about i call you the  a-h-man don't get started again now opie and anthony in the middle of the night i get an email from 
[02:19:00]  eric that i read this morning when i got up that he's very very depressed because his refrigerator door  it made a break for obie and anthony stupid australians whose national hero got killed  by a docile flying fish  this is the worst the worst show i've this is the worst show i've ever been on but enough of this  palaver let's get the show on the road broadcasting in front of a live studio audience the opie and anthony 
[02:19:30]  show yeah yeah just like when they said that on tv yes filmed in front of a live audience a live  audience good times yeah they always say yeah from hollywood right in living color we got a nice crowd  today yeah i hear one of the guys uh that placed in the animation festival is here maybe we should  start with that although i walked into a fine discussion about uh having a black president and 
[02:20:00]  uh the definition of a hero i think you guys were talking about heroes the definition of  hero is a tough one why is that a tough one well it's because i don't know let's just say this  there was a valid point raised about whenever people are killed uh a lot of times this the  hero is misused like um i think like in 9-11 it was used properly to describe firefighters they were  doing their jobs here bravely but it just seems like every time something bad happens like with 
[02:20:30]  this boy scout it's very sad that they were killed but they're saying remembering the heroes where  the kids have died it's like i don't know what they did that was heroic and it's and that that's not  even a shitty thing because it's a sad thing yeah there's no misuse of the term right yeah yeah i'm a hero  well how are they using of course yes you make people laugh now fuck that i mean to prostitutes who need  drugs and have no money to gain them that's to a certain virus yeah that needs live blood how are  they connecting the boy scouts to the hero term i don't know just by making their parents feel 
[02:21:00]  better or something yeah it's one of those things what do you know what do you like it's a touchy  subject but it's like you're not a hero because you just couldn't get out you  that's why no one refutes it like we shouldn't be here refuting the fact that they're heroes right 
[02:21:30]  but they're they're kind of not but we can't just say that because you know the parents feel bad i think  um hero was used accurately to describe uh wow what happened to that guy he just bashed his head  against the the cop door the cop glass wow that's some good footage on msnbc they'll be rolling that  all day long what he wasn't happy that he was arrested and he's banging his head up against the glass  think you could come to that conclusion and the uh in car cam capturing it all yeah all right where's 
[02:22:00]  the where's the guy that uh placed in the animation where's our gifts yeah i heard he brought  gifts that's what you should be doing with your prize money that's right presents for the gods that's  right what did he get out of that yeah five what place did you come in sir second uh slaughterhouse  yeah did a good job that was like pixar stuff man do you work you obviously work for an animation  house uh really tiny place doing bad infomercials what uh what program was that light wave oh light 
[02:22:30]  wave yeah that's the cheap off the shelf one yes anything we would know that uh your your employer  did uh no not really unless you watch the sci-fi channel the really bad movies on there too oh my god  yeah yeah like davis and butthead i love those movies those special effects aren't so special  do you watch the sci-fi channel movies not really oh they're great they always have like what's his name 
[02:23:00]  like the fucking labumbo what's his name oh neil diamond lou diamond phillips is always in those  now and the guy that hung himself from office and a gentleman yeah he's always in him too oh michael no  that's not michael rooker that's uh david keith yeah or keith david's black right david keith yeah he's  the guy that hung himself and it'll be called um it'll be like a mixture of a bee and a tiger we call  right right b tiger it looks so bad the special effects is so bad sorry they're really like 
[02:23:30]  that's his and it's always a blurry camera that represents the the monster looking at you yeah  monster but i watch them if they have a marathon i watch it all night long can't get enough right  bad acting bad storylines octopus pigeon it'll just be with dean kane as the scientist 
[02:24:00]  all those are horrible i love those man your shitty company does that  fucking a man eight o'clock that gets me through every sunday afternoon and saturday afternoon  a lot of people saying slaughterhouse should have won the whole thing well we agreed we have two  judges in studio jimmy you know norton wanted to win it but we we did it very fairly yeah it was  we raised our hands you think this is number one norton raises hands for that you think this is  number like which one did you vote to win it all purchase number one uh everybody both voted number 
[02:24:30]  one for like it's almost like you could give a number a first place vote to anyone you wanted  so we raised our hand to which one so it's like okay the other one got all five people raised their  hand was the uh ecstasy of gold that that one people were like is that in the fucking jimmy  said slaughterhouse no no no it's like you rate oh you voted ecstasy number one we go we go slaughter  we go slaughterhouse who how many people think slaughterhouse was the best one jimmy you know jimmy 
[02:25:00]  would go he raised his hand there was another person but people said ecstasy of gold it was like  got more votes everybody i just got more votes that's all you're trying to say  but no i'm like oh my god i think he voted number one too no i didn't i remember i didn't  it was like two of us i think voted for uh slaughterhouse i hope the presidential election  goes like this it's all it won't it won't to be fair also i told you deep impact baby just keep  watching it oh really just keep watching it he saves the earth didn't you feel comfortable when that

[02:29:30]  but the fact that the gas prices aren't gonna lower um because it's a private sector i mean the  oil doesn't owe us anything that's the thing about the oil thing it's like if you're on crack and a  motherfucker goes you know what instead of the crack dealer goes instead of ten dollars it's gonna be  twenty deal with it motherfucker now that's what the oil companies are doing why do why do we need  breaks now it's the private sector they're fucking everybody but as as people as humans it's like  somebody just because they need help doesn't mean they're begging for help means you need some

[02:31:00]  share i don't want to do more please add i don't want to do more can you please add poor white folks  to it too because you get the insinuation that this is more black shit there's white people are  in the same boat and that's what i don't like is that this is really not a black and white thing  it's it's black people make a black and white thing well because they do it's terrible bring  him in i don't know why anthony you are outnumbered today dl hugley please i know dl feels the same way  i do he don't want his tax money going up jesus christ he'll agree with me first of all because he's 
[02:31:30]  black  yeah on fridays we kind of do the live  friday's the day to come by and check out the show live oh man what's up the uh what did i miss  just in a heated dispute about obama and taxes and social programs and and and my tax money going 
[02:32:00]  up for shit programs but you can't you can't control what the government's going to do with  your fucking tax money so just it'll go where it goes i don't want it going oh how does the elephant  i mean okay here's here it is here to reallocate where my fucking money that i'm paying already  goes and i'm fine with it but that isn't what he's not guaranteeing that my tax  shit's gonna go up i don't what makes you say that because because there's gonna be there's  gonna got to be all kinds of social programs now that obama's gonna want to put in place this 
[02:32:30]  this is honest this is an honest question we we have where our economy's failing right yeah  tax revenues i mean are down and nobody's making any money right so obviously what we're doing hasn't  worked yeah so what is wrong with trying i i because uh first of all too much money a chance  there's too much money being spent on a fucking war right that's the problem  he's gonna get out of you know he's not gonna get out of it he's not he's gonna he's gonna try 
[02:33:00]  to here's good luck i don't i really don't believe i believe preachers pimps and politicians  are really all the same motherfuckers they really are like anybody who makes their living off your  hopes your dreams and your fears really all the same guy um and this is a job application i can't  this is the biggest job application i don't know one motherfucker that tells the truth on a job  application when is the last time you don't even tell the truth on your driver's license  what woman out there really weigh 112  but i think that that that america has a tendency to pick symbols they go this is 
[02:33:30]  like to me i worry that he's a symbol like people go look how far we've come we elected he is he is  a symbol though we're gonna change it else he's like k-mart we changed the shine but not the  shit in it that's what that's why i just won the black president that's why all that other horse  shit that you know trying to find the the the the the the fucking like in in pencil see this thing  white people always got to find a reason to not be racist like you got to find a reason to just go 
[02:34:00]  i ain't voting for this nigga it's got to be some reason he can't he can't bowl but for them it was  like the nigga couldn't bowl i don't trust a nigga that can't bowl in pennsylvania and west virginia  it's funny because in west virginia let me tell you first off a black dude with a cardboard  sign asking for change in west virginia they're like is he panhandling i don't even know what  he's doing but uh in in west virginia and ohio and um uh west virginia ohio uh the dakotas  even in puerto rico you gotta consider she was winning primaries by large numbers 
[02:34:30]  even when they knew she couldn't win 19 of americans say i wouldn't vote for him no matter what  that's the 19 of americans that come out and say it so how many people how many how many here's  here's the question how many out of the 300 million white people you figure how many can  there's 300 million white people in this country yeah 300 million people no 300 million god damn  white people get the fuck out of here look at the fucking thing i'm not gonna just that's all 
[02:35:00]  population wait a minute no it's not you're saying a number and i'm saying a number and i'm wrong  fuck that maybe 200 now let's just say how many how many of those people do obama need how many white  people do obama need to fucking win the presidency fuck the racist ones they ain't gonna vote for  them or anyway but the the guilty the white people that have white guilt and the actual decent white  people who go all right you're gonna get i don't know you're gonna get this is a great conversation 
[02:35:30]  he's gonna get the democratic vote you know not necessarily what you think it's no racist democrats  what oh they're racist democrats that won't say fuck that when they go in the curtain connecting with  the blue-collar rural democrats who grow yeah for some reason whatever people grow  shit they don't like black people like uh and farmers and black people farmers used to love us  i don't know i don't know how we drifted apart this is great because we're giving away all my 
[02:36:00]  tomatoes to wick programs we're fucking assholes goddamn niggas getting my corn for free it's awful  but i think people are getting like to me um the the the like politicians i don't even know why  you want to be like you guys lost the governor just because he hired a hooker and i didn't even  know that was and he wrote a check for a hooker which i think is like that's pretty much a  cash and carry business right there yeah yeah no right no credit cards right and then you  replace him with a black dude who's black blind admitted he had several uh affairs and dick cocaine 
[02:36:30]  so he's basically ray charles like because when you're blind you can get away with anything you  mean that wasn't my wife that is true you know i think he gets away with a little more so i think  politicians in general like like it's to me america has a problem like congress's approval rating is down  but you ask everybody do they love their congressman and they do and they said yeah let me let me it  sounds like you're saying and and it sounds like you're saying obama and i agree with this on a 
[02:37:00]  level i mean you might not be saying this but i'm not really into what doesn't sound like i'm saying  it sounds like you're saying he ain't shit anyway because he's a politician right but and i and i agree  with it on on that level but the next level that i'm i just want there on on i just want there to be  a black president well because you gotta get it out the way watch what you want to get out the way  okay listen but i agree with that i don't i agree with that but what i'm saying is the the the 
[02:37:30]  transcendent what i don't like is any politician telling any politician telling me how great things  are going to be if he is in charge but you know it's you know it's not i will go but jackie  robinson wasn't even the best black baseball player when he came it's just like what happens is once  he's the president then black people because black people really weird we're just one constituency at  least white people can be two things you can be three things white you can be democrat or republican  black people on this thing we got to be black you can be black a democrat or an uncle no no 
[02:38:00]  it's pretty much if you're a republican but basically we got to be black on this issue  so that then we can be cut in half because like there's enough black mayors for a black person to  not have to vote for a mayor because he's black right you gotta vote for the black president because  he's black just to get this as something that just like black quarterbacks there's enough black  quarterbacks where a white person can go this motherfucker sucks without being a racist 
[02:38:30]  a racist so you can't go obama sucks but you can go to mayor or detroit sucks well no here's what  you could do i think that just for me i have a pragmatic uh kind of view i don't believe that  politicians by nature are good people i think and so i and he to me is one of them and and and he to  me is one of them i hate when everybody he what i hate that everybody's acting like he's not a he's not  jesus he is a politician yes and so i keep politicians you know at the ldl come on now 
[02:39:00]  you do you are alive you are alive with possibly fuck all the the the logistics of politics man you  may be alive and if he's a fucked up guy at least he's a black fucked up guy we need to see a black  president i want to see a black president my point is i don't want what i don't want is for anybody to  confuse the fact of course i vote for him because i believe he's the best of what we have but i 
[02:39:30]  don't place any politician in high esteem he's the best of what we have and i think that that is an  america i think the problem in america is that we don't ever hold these people accountable we kind  of go i'll vote for you because of this i'll vote because you can make all the promises you want  but you ain't ever got to keep them because of this the bottom line this country's in the shape  that it's in because people make dumb decisions right and they constantly make dumb decisions for  all dumbery i'm not saying him i'm talking about as a nation and and we all make because it's basically  a dude who's half black against run against a dude who's half dead let me ask you this let me let me 
[02:40:00]  ask you this if you if you thought if you thought right and this is as a black man this is one of those  questions and and i'm not one of these motherfuckers go oh you're this or that because you i'm just  asking if if you thought mccain was really a better candidate but i couldn't think that i'm i'm saying  i'm saying his politics if you weighed each each of their politics obama or mccain if you waited 
[02:40:30]  and you go fuck mccain stands for more thing i'm being hypothetical mccain stands for more things  that i stand for would you vote mccain if i vote if i wouldn't mother if i believe in somebody if  i believe i'm not gonna you know what i'm never gonna do i'm never gonna be somebody else for the  i think that for the sake of expediency like i think we do too many things because we get caught  up in the stream and go i would vote for a guy who i believed in regardless of what i don't believe  in mccain i don't believe in the republican party right so that i'm just being hypothetical 
[02:41:00]  but it ain't no hypothetical for me i'm gonna vote what i want regardless of what i don't hold  the party but how about jesus being racist i do you're being completely racist man okay  i just want there look it i don't think the motherfucker's going to change nothing i don't  think it's going to be the black dawn of anything let me tell you whitey's point of view on this  whole thing though is and just what i said black president all bets are going to be off and this  is whitey's point of view they're good every every white guy is going to say now there's a black 
[02:41:30]  fucking president shut the fuck up shut the fuck up no shit i'm not shitting you this motherfucker  this motherfucker got to the presidency of the united states so can you all bets are off right  go fuck yourself that's what whitey's gonna say pick your bootstraps up look yes pick yourself up by  your bootstraps go to school whatever the fuck it takes whatever he did to get into that office you  can do now invent you transcend racism you invent anything what to make it comfortable for white 
[02:42:00]  folks this is my thing i don't want i don't want to hear black this is what i'm saying about black  people i we get into this thing where we try to be as diplomatic as you when we're talking in terms of  okay look this that and the third in terms of you know the viewpoint and i'm saying dude i  just want there to be a black president just as a symbol as you don't as a as a symbol of pride it's 
[02:42:30]  not that we've overcome but it is that a little bit but you you feel like this is a black president  i don't i don't disagree with you but i'm gonna tell you this i agree that what you're saying is  right but i agree also this that they are the you the minute that he gets in office they are going to  say hey man you don't need affirmative action no more but we no reparations where i'd rather cut  one check than 33 million and i think that you can't have it both ways you got to be and you got 
[02:43:00]  to say you know what this is what i want this is what i signed up for me personally i believe that  he is better than mccain because i think he is a more uh he is a more worldly person like he gets  he doesn't have as myopic a view as mccain does how about okay how about if i didn't believe that  strong williams or say a clarence thomas was running against me was running against mccain  then i vote for mccain if it was armstrong williams and mccain the same guy they're the same guy 
[02:43:30]  well to me i try never i try look this is what i've always tried to do i speak my mind i don't  i ain't got no coalition i'm gonna take what i think right i believe obama is clearly better than john  mccain i believe that so and you do too right right a lot of people do no i don't like no me i  don't like uh obama's stance on a lot he's too he's too liberal for me i'm not a liberal guy i like  fucking guns and here's what i like here's what i like here's what i'm offering to you this is what  i'm saying in terms of this i like dope guns everything right bitches i'm offering you then you 
[02:44:00]  then you like what's the difference you can shoot a bitch white anthony just doesn't want to look at  that face behind the party with the white hands exactly come on exactly i think that is not here's  what i'm offering you anthony on this i'm offering you the black presidency now so that when you make  any statement based not on color as you claim quote unquote signs sure then i could possibly 
[02:44:30]  go with you without thinking that i'm speaking purely right now right somebody said what if there  was a white if there was if a white person said i'm only going to vote for him because he's white  would that be if there had only been black presidents then if a white person said boy i want to see a  white president would i understand yeah the fact is our command in chief has been nothing but old  white guys if hillary had went through i'd rather see just to see a woman president right then you can 
[02:45:00]  go i don't like his politics and i can go fair enough just like if you go i don't like donovan  mcnab if there was only one black quarterback ever i i'll go you fucking racist but there's a lot  they broke ground now you cannot like a black guy  i see what you're saying you're not allowed to dislike barack obama right now he's the first  black president because the second so so what you're saying what you're saying is that no matter 
[02:45:30]  honestly how shitty you thought he was no matter how so if it was between armstrong williams and john  mccain you still pick armstrong because he was black as painful as that is that i couldn't do it  i couldn't i would i'd go it would just be too enormous for me because you just want an ice  breaker i want an ice i just would i'd vote colin powell this is another thing too this is what i'm  saying how come colin powell and condoleezza rice aren't black leaders how come but only 
[02:46:00]  motherfuckers y'all don't like are our leaders you understand wait wait wait because because black  community we don't we don't appoint our fucking leaders you do white people do yes you do farrakhan  and sharpton no when is the last time condoleezza rice and colin powell gathered people but they're  black and they're lead because colin powell because colin powell didn't come out uh and march  like a reverend owl would um i don't know what he listens to reverend owl is a leader but i don't really 
[02:46:30]  i don't i i personally don't know one reverend owl does yeah i think leaders don't appoint this so  that just kind of happens i think that i can respect condoleezza i don't agree with her views  i respect what she's done i respect what colin powell has done like to you can't now would you  vote for colin powell for colin powell because i think that he's a bright uh uh worldly man who  actually understands would you vote for condoleezza rice i would i i couldn't see vote for condoleezza 
[02:47:00]  race i couldn't see i could this is why i couldn't see it this is nazi and this is this is why it has  to be but then you say a black president so that you can just it can patrice racism will still still  be there but at least i can listen to you i understand what you're saying i just need it i  need it patrice wants to vote for someone based on the color of their skin and not the content of  their character i love the way you think you mother oh who the who the fuck said that away from  a black man who just said that oh wait a minute don't be doing white tricks with me you're using 
[02:47:30]  i'm using jedi what the fuck am i hope you want to do for your country it's no question to me that  barack obama is clearly more the more of my mindset than than than uh mccain if he were not  what's his politics if he were not if he were not i would not have if he were not i wouldn't have a  problem not voting for what's his politics that that would go okay i'm i'm voting for him because 
[02:48:00]  of his politics why i'm voting for him because i think that he at least but has has a a more worldly  view he's not as myopic and he's not as connected to one mindset like like mccain in in 2000 i love  mccain i thought he was a smart uh independent uh uh you know kind of uh uh you know uh independent  thinker and who did his own kind of thing and he was a maverick i bought that thing but is he  really myopic though i mean he's pretty like a concern he's a pretty liberal republican he's  against torture like a lot of the things that they could show no shit he's against  as opposed to what yeah a lot of them don't go with whatever the cia but but he did 
[02:48:30]  weem is against plungers mccain started pandering to the religious right as soon as he got in trouble  like he started paying into the religious right as soon as he got so if he believes what he  believes that's fine i personally believe barack obama and but i did pander by the way when he  dropped out of church i do not let me let me get this straight i think and i'm a you think he was  more qualified than hillary oh i don't i think everybody lies on their job application i don't 
[02:49:00]  think he was uh any more or less qualified than her but i i would have i would have been happy with  either one of them i don't have to hate her to love him i didn't have to go oh she's so i didn't  have to have uh you know i didn't have to go oh she's terrible he's great i think all all politicians  politicians in fairly low esteem i guarantee is better women to me than her women would have voted  and here's the cutoff this is the weird thing okay the the strange thing is okay women would  have had to choose like okay if you're a black woman you would have to choose obama like either 
[02:49:30]  your color or your gender or whatever that case may be if if hillary had a made it to the to the  primary if she had made it through as a candidate i'd have voted for her because she's a woman just  that i would never do that i i would never do that i just would have to man i would not you know what  my i just this is this is so it happened to be and the fact that they were democrats made it made it  easier if they were republican it would have been i'm telling you i don't believe people died in march 
[02:50:00]  and and went through all the bush that they go through so i can hold some some  bullshit line in my head people have to earn my respect just like i got to go out there and earn  respect from people if i don't respect the motherfucker i'm not voting for them i don't  give a shit what they got next to their name who they are what their gender is and i think that it's  that mindset it really is that mindset they got people people voted for george bush clearly because  they went i want a guy who talks like me i want a guy who and and and i want a guy who's just as dumb as i 
[02:50:30]  do you know jackie jackie robinson jackie robinson was known not to be the best not even the 10 top  black players right was jackie robinson known to be he was just that nigger which is obama he's that  nigger he's my he got exactly what you said meaning meaning he does all the things jesus all the things  that that a black guy has to do to make white people feel comfortable that's what he's that guy 
[02:51:00]  my problem is i don't like people when when white people like something i tend to go wow why do they  like it's that little suspicious i kind of go i'm with you but i'm saying jackie robinson jackie robinson  had to get in he just had to get in but we're talking apples and oranges one is a baseball team which  is purely for entertainment another guy's going to be ruling the world i wouldn't i wouldn't say 
[02:51:30]  and and how much other world is he going to be ruling how powerful is the president i think  i think the president is the fucking united states you know not as powerful as a lot of people like  to think or think but uh pretty fucking somebody can somebody can tell him to go fuck himself like  he has to get things voted on he can't just make rules let me tell you something george bush was  powerful enough to have a fucking war going on over in iraq he had no he had the backing of the  country no shit how did he get that 11 how did he get that but he but he he duped congress and to 
[02:52:00]  give him all the power it's pretty powerful isn't it that's not power whatever he did whatever he did  was his it was it was emotions from from the country how is that not power that's not  fucking that is power that's manipulation yeah his power is manipulation power yeah you're right  it is they can be he has veto power he has veto power the president can veto almost anything he can  say no but he can't say yes he can veto he can't just make rules he but he did but it was based on 
[02:52:30]  us power based on everyone is based on our ignorance and fear right thank you and i'm gonna say the same  thing again thank you never will i ever give my vote to somebody just because somebody tells me i'll  never be pressured to think like anybody what's your gut feeling on on barack i believe honestly your  gut don't fuck all the politics i don't know him you don't know i don't know i don't know McCain either  so i'll take the lesser that basically you say what i'm saying no no what you're saying is you would 
[02:53:00]  vote for the black person in any circumstances what i'm saying Armstrong williams and all that  shit is a tough one those are tough names i know just to test myself this is my thing how  fucked up are you this is the this is the indictment of george bush's presidency how  fucked the president are you when the option is we're gonna vote for the black guy oh wow  we want the black guy your shit is your library is gonna be he really fucked up oh my god but i i i 
[02:53:30]  never i have never believed i've never believed and that matters when i believe race is the is  the issue i with you if you ask me uh what i think on any number of things i but i will never vote for  somebody just because they were a woman or they lived in my neighborhood or they were this or they  were that you don't come to me just having respect just because you walk up to me i have to know you  emotional if he gets if he gets voted president sure sure i will to see a black man go through the  struggles that he's gone through and the stuff that he's gone through but i've never seen a here's 
[02:54:00]  here's my thing i've never seen a person so lotted and so so uh it makes it scares me that people are  putting uh you know you would think jesus is here and he's just he's a politician but could he be  could he possibly be the dude let's say underneath all of that was farrakhan jr okay could he really  let's say if farrakhan was the president could he really do what white people are afraid he might do 
[02:54:30]  could he really well as a newly patriated french person i wouldn't know  i would see a split screen of obama getting inducted and just see like patrice and anthony both crying  from completely different but i'll tell you this it'll be like the oj version just like the oj version  right i believe i at the time i believe oj was innocent when i watched it now it's true i 
[02:55:00]  fucking i believe it's in now seeing it now i go wow that motherfucker did it after that book  if i killed the bitch when he wrote a book called if i killed the bitch and this is what i would have  been i wouldn't have a problem saying out loud i believe he did like but but i didn't when i when i  watch the trial it's very emotional for me i just kind of went oh man that's so i'm not  proof there's a whole different way of looking i looked at that trial and just said he's guilty 
[02:55:30]  you're politically savvy man you're a savvy guy you're a savvy guy now but but i'm saying there's  never that you've never been racially things weren't racially motivated in terms of in your  life like the oj verdict look sure i i that is it's a rate things are racially motivated man you got  to have this thing with i i'm i'm just not gonna i'm just gonna take that lowest road if if you want  to call it where i'm like fuck that man i want to see the black president because we've lived through 
[02:56:00]  some fuck this nigga that's the president now this goofy motherfucker that's got us in the world  could he be worse than him no come the fuck on man i want to see it i want to see the black president  but that's that's it that i want to see i i'm gonna like we get into the same conclusion on you  taking the 405 and i'm taking i believe that he's a better he's the best candidate we have now and i  believe that he is better suited for the gig than mccain probably because he'll live through the 
[02:56:30]  inauguration but i'm not sure mccain would live through the swearing in but i would never me personally  vote for the like oj i had to believe he was innocent i had to really believe it and for whatever  reason and when i learned when i when i looked at other things i went oh maybe he it isn't what  i thought it was i have no problem admitting whether i'm wrong or right race plays attention  race plays a part in in a lot of things i do but as far as me voting for somebody or as far as me  looking at the situation objectively i just try to be as human as possible do you think that the 
[02:57:00]  people that fought in the civil rights movement with jim crow days and all that do you think okay  that they would be happy if he became the president just because he was black i think they of  course sure so why i don't well you you asking me you ask me that's apples and oranges am i not  really i'm not giving it i'm not giving anybody anything just because they're anything is my  point no nobody ever gave me one thing because i was anything so i would never give that he he  walks the same earth i do puts on his pants the same way i do i gotta go out and earn respect 
[02:57:30]  he got honor we do agree he has he has done him on right some level like he's the messiah yeah  fuck i'm only talking about uh a symbol and not a symbol uh it's a it's a symbol of it might even  like i always pictured like niggas stop shooting each other because the black president like that  all right wouldn't that be nice what i'm saying if he's the black president it's like let's just make  him proud let's be right let's but you know maybe it'll write us up just because he's the black 
[02:58:00]  president you can't have it both ways here's what i believe i believe that if if he is president and we  don't as a people kind of go that is our cue to elevate ourselves that is our cue if this dude  came from indonesia hawaii kansas i don't even know where he's from so i couldn't like this dude  the last time i saw a dude from that many places he's running from the police but  but if he has found a way to connect with america that way then it is in us all and and you know what 
[02:58:30]  when they take everything away because that's what's going to happen everybody's going to say you  know what if this cat can do it all you guys can do it now it's a level playing field we're giving  you then you this guy's elevated from nothing to the highest uh position in the world i think that  is a challenge that we have to kind of accept we have to kind of go you know what the game has changed  but you can't have it both ways you gotta be the president you can't say i want him to be president  and i still want all this other shit because you're gonna give something up to get you got to get to get  and i really believe that that in this situation there is not a more and i don't respond to him because 
[02:59:00]  he's a speaker because i think all do you know all politicians speak i think that he's cleared  a more candidate if i did more qualified candidate if i didn't think it two things i wouldn't have a  problem saying it and i wouldn't have a problem not voting for i would never vote for somebody  just because uh somebody said that i i don't go to meetings where people go hey man this is the way  we feel about this i'm gonna tell you how i feel i i ain't part of the collective just like when  people feel a certain way about like all the bullshit that people get into about how you should speak and 
[02:59:30]  what you should think is funny ain't no collective for me but but you gotta understand now that there  there is an outside there is an outside effect in terms of okay black people aren't really the  toughest thing i think to be being black as you're younger is to be individual is to say right this  is what i think right fuck the other shit right and really i'm saying what i think because i know there's 
[03:00:00]  a lot of black people who are like fuck that i'm not even voting for him now you know i'm not gonna  vote for him because he's black fuck him i don't like him or whatever his stance on abortion is i'm  saying dude it's bigger it's so big because you know watching roots and and just feeling how i felt  watching roots feeling i felt felt watching rosewood just just the basic instinct of  anger you have towards white people on a general basis it's hard for me to just be in here sometimes 
[03:00:30]  and just be your friend and listen to my shit but just just just because you're white and there's a  there is a natural instinct not to like white folks you know it's so odd and i just and i just want  i just want to just know you know what i look at patrice i look at patrice and go i don't even think  of you as a black guy and this is the god's honest truth i don't look at you like if you're walking  down the street i'd fucking be on the other side of the street but see that's what i understand i 
[03:01:00]  i understand that shit it's like you know knowing you would never be friends outside of the fact that  we're friends it's i wouldn't bump into him in the street or whatever there is a just uh a i just would  love to feel something that i know i've never really felt before um externally externally but  that's different that's the system here's that that's different i want to see a black president  i get it but i would never vote for somebody just because they were anything and you said something  that was absolutely true the hardest thing for a black person to do is to be an individual is to 
[03:01:30]  say this is how i feel this is and like michael vick dude i fucking hated that motherfucker for that  but people you know you get a preponderance of the media where black people go  black people don't give a fuck about no dogs and i'm like i love dogs  but i didn't i i i that's that's nuance for me like like with the with the whole  don embers thing i thought it was a dumb joke and i thought it was you know i don't i don't think 
[03:02:00]  what i what i do is i go how the fuck do i feel i don't go on the black america website i don't  and that's a hard that's a hard thing to do i do that too it's very fucking different when i was  defending don imus right i'm telling you and it's not even here my spacing i'm like i'm are you  fucking kidding me did you just call me uh uncle fucking i'm here defending any black that's why i  called dl yeah which i i love this too this is a great story um which made me start calling people 
[03:02:30]  from a um block number i reached out i found this motherfucker to get me to call he called me  from a block number and didn't give me his fucking phone i'm sorry no but i'm saying that made me  i didn't realize i didn't give you you know and i said to myself i go you know i'm doing that  shit too this is what i when i teach my son particularly man be when a man stands by itself 
[03:03:00]  like it ain't never like my father said you came in this world you're probably gonna die alone  you're gonna come you can go out of the world alone man being an individual and having your own  mindset and understanding how you feel is the ultimate responsibility and it's the ultimate  freedom to me i want my son if he's nothing else to be human and to literally look at the situation 
[03:03:30]  bravo and and no no no but not the grandstand and to and to give no man respect he hasn't earned  simply because he's anything simply because he's an athlete simply because he did you you give any  human being a certain amount of respect just for me personally i don't i don't look at what people  tell me i look at what they do but look there's something deeper about black people's illness  in terms of this like this is what you don't is this vt we radio you know there's some truckers 
[03:04:00]  driving off of real quick screaming at the radio why aren't you guys saying anything  let the two niggas fight it out all this all this  we're too scared we're scared  why don't they just play bongos help us they've hijacked our show  we're too scared to talk first day the president and now they've taken over the open anthony show  hey patrice by the way there's 304  give me some chicken there's 304 million people in the united states and there's 243 million whites 
[03:04:30]  and just under uh 40 million blacks you know white people come up with wait a minute so two so  how many is how many people will go on the website and you said this then there's 304 million people  in this country yeah you said there's 300 200 and what 43 43 million white and 40 million blacks yes  there's only 20 more million other motherfuckers here chinese well you gotta count some spanish  people that are black that they don't know yeah are you serious that's what they're saying only 
[03:05:00]  that's wrong that's what they're saying you can't say that's wrong i'm saying that's  fucking wrong there's no more fucking goddamn puerto ricans and mexicans in this country than us  puerto ricans are just niggas who can swim that's all they are they're the same thing  no these are the same thing this is probably this is probably citizens the same thing what is that  from 19 what july 2008 this is what's going to be estimated uh next month when they uh put the  numbers out but i mean these are these are citizens obviously this isn't the illegals 
[03:05:30]  all right why don't we take a oh you know what you're not counting illegals you're right  why don't we take a break we got dl hugley in studio he's playing carolines uh all weekend long  and no uh first the rally then carolina yeah me and patrice are leading people  get your red bow ties out i guess dude i can't get the passion up uh to talk politics i just can't  it's not even a politics no this is all just human thing i like the point that dl said and and being 
[03:06:00]  an individual is probably the most important thing but you said it first no because patrice is saying  he's he's oh no wait wait before you finish my brain is fried okay so i wanted to  say something real quick real quick you never say anything real quick  let me say something i'm gonna try to say something real quick  they they understand is is the black is that is when that's the one thing about okay when we  do something like when we do something yeah it's like oh you people we we have to defend every black 
[03:06:30]  dude that's the thing when we don't we don't i know what you're saying we don't but i'm saying  externally we don't but internally for some reason when a nigga fucks up all of the black people got  to go oh i don't make an excuse i don't you don't but as as a whole group you know what i'm saying but  white people when white people fuck up that white person fucked up not the whole as a whole you get to  enjoy being an individual you're right because as white people even without the pressure externally 
[03:07:00]  of going you know there's never white pride there's never open white pride yeah because  people you can't yeah holy shit you can't fuck it i would love to march down the street hey whitey  well you could do it if it wasn't if i was burning behind you well that's true but i just you know  what it is if i wasn't half sicilian too and by the way we do have white pride every time we see each  other in the supermarket we'll look at pasteurized milk just kind of waking each other open heart 
[03:07:30]  search oh we did that you know what to me is this everybody always everybody always asks you like i always  get like uh even when i came in for the first time how do black i can never tell you how black people feel  we're a whole race of people that got how can you talk for one race of people that got flavor  flame and cool and pop right you know what i'm saying how does one dude encapsulate all the  stuff all you can ever do is speak and i and i hate people anybody who doesn't speak their own mind 
[03:08:00]  who goes with the collective is a fucking sheep that's all you are all you doing is what somebody  told you you might as well be a fucking robot that's i get it i understand that's easier to do  i understand that's why i hate the party line shit like why if i if i'm a republican  why do i have to be against women getting abortions but that's unless they're mine  like i'm a fucking huge second amendment guy but i'm also for a woman's right to choose  i'm insane then as a fucking republican but but my thing is that i just became a democrat two years 
[03:08:30]  ago i was an independent for all of you because i never even liked the kind i like to pick i like  guns i think well let me tell you something guns now that's against your party for the most  part but i look here i i i dig guns i dig abortion i think we should be legal i think that we are too  fiscally irresponsible i think that uh uh the uh i think that anyone less government in your life  i want a lot less government in my life i think that religion is too is encroaching too much in 
[03:09:00]  government so i what i've done is tell you how i feel i didn't i don't go what does the d say or what  does the r say i'll tell you how i feel but most of the people in these parties that you're forced  pretty much to vote for because they run right along the party line so who the  fuck are you gonna vote for but even that even like when everybody's having the black president  i got all that confusion out  when they were having the primaries i didn't think i don't think that america responds to 
[03:09:30]  ethereal talk i think that america want like people are we're not gonna respond to the politics  of fear your whole fucking life is fear your mother says do this or that'll happen this job  says either do this i'll fire you religion says do this or you go in hell fear runs us all the bottom  line to me is i i think that america gets what it wants and it always pick makes it it makes poor  decisions because it's generally in ill-informed and makes decisions based on all kind of  bullshit that doesn't it's 50 million americans don't have health care you ask the average person 
[03:10:00]  do they think you should have health care they go yeah you should have it you you put you you  say socialized medicine then they go fuck you i'm not paying for it yeah i don't think you should  die in this country uh uh i don't care what if you're lazy or whatever i was just in edmonton alberta  they have the best economy in the north why wasn't there an interruption there jack because i'm  waiting to talk about how senator uh kennedy uh and his brain tumor and healthcare and if if if  if we had socialized medicine like senator kennedy wanted he would still have that 
[03:10:30]  fucking orange in his head why because it would because you don't fucking step up to a hospital  get the best doctor and say hey take the tumor out of my head you wait on a fucking list you sit  and wait for a fucking doctor you're not getting the best doctor so you should not you should get  you should get but he's a rich motherfucker and he was able to get whatever he wants but but  and that's america you're not why the fuck did this country turn into something where everyone's  entitled to something instead of working up to him because working up to getting the brain 
[03:11:00]  removed from your head one is what the fuck is wrong with you we got it right exactly we got  he is a spoiled bastard we have to do two things if we're not going to be the america we espouse then  that's not like we let's be russian let's be as shitty as we think we as we say that but we're  gonna put god in our constitution and we're gonna act like we're a judo christian society and we're  judeo christian society and we are a nation of laws and rules and we're a nation of human rights and 
[03:11:30]  dignity a human being should never die because it is they're poor i don't give a fuck why they are  anyone can go into the fucking hospital you go to the emergency room some people are going to get  shitty care some people are going to get good care hold on did you just hear that point i did  did you used to be poor yes do you think you should have been dead if you couldn't afford to live if  you know something if i was fucked up when i was poor i then i'd be dead that's the no no i asked you  do you think you should be dead because you couldn't afford to be alive uh no but in certain 
[03:12:00]  circumstances that's just the way we are a country that fights to have the pledge of allegiance  you know and we're fights that we we fight to have prayer in school we fight to have prayers  right we fight to bring god that's based on this puritanical bullshit that started hundreds of  years ago but i'm saying if you're going to put god in your life and talk about how you love jesus  and how we're christian society the very tenet of jesus regardless of what people think is that you  love the poor and the sick that's what you do now if you're going to take jesus out we're going to be 
[03:12:30]  a country that is just kind of a pluralistic country we don't give a fuck about anything that's fine but if  you're going to if you're going to talk about how much you love jesus then and how much uh how you  can't even you can't be president unless you do you can't literally be president of the united states  of america unless you go to church and kill convicts well you know you can't you you can't  obama pretty soon is gonna have to shoot something well your personal fucking religion your personal  shit as far as religion goes isn't supposed and you said isn't supposed to encroach in on the 
[03:13:00]  government but it does but it's not supposed to it's written there separation of we're not supposed to pay  taxes but we do exactly that i don't like that either okay so but the thing is you're just a  fucking you're poor rich trash like you're hysterical patrice you're just a piece of garbage but you're  a millionaire let me just let me just let me just say this when did this country become the country  where everyone's entitled to the same fucking thing there are poor people there are rich hold on 
[03:13:30]  hold on there are poor people and there are rich people in this country it's what this country's based  on if you're lucky and you make something yourself you have uh some skill whatever the  fuck it is listen to you laugh no this is what america is made for some people fall in their ass  and fucking get nowhere and others because there's a lot of people that's what this whole country  was based on the country was built it wasn't based to come here because we're going to give you what  the fuck uh you you want this country was based wasn't guaranteed on exploiting uh uh it really was 
[03:14:00]  it was based on black labor it was black labor free black labor italians then it was africans  now it's the mexicans it's that new term they the new niggas but the bottom line is this country was  based on exploiting somebody and and getting rich from it that's what happened now it is becoming a  place where people have felt bad about their past and are trying to right a lot of the wrongs of the  past so a lot of things that wouldn't have happened had white guilt but if we if we are going to be a  country where every time every time i turn around some politician is saying we are the moral authority in the 
[03:14:30]  world and right after that a commercial will come off of girls gone wild if we're going to be  a moral authority if we're going to constantly talk about jesus and constantly talking about  elephant like the country now talking about change we need to change we need to change the two minutes  we are the we we've been waiting for we it's changing the tone of the country then you have to  accept all just like i told him you have to accept all that comes along with uh when when obama's  you have to accept the fact that this country is going to have to do some of the things that actually  so people are so so then everyone is entitled by just being an american you're entitled to certain 
[03:15:00]  things whether you work for them or not whether you're lucky enough to have i don't think you i  don't think you should i don't think any human being i think that we place such a value on we  we love money so much in this country we put god on our money so we could have everything in the same  space but to me i just am a as from a human standpoint i just don't believe that people your care should be  better than some people because you can afford it so everybody everybody everybody should eat 
[03:15:30]  everybody should eat because if you don't eat you'll be dead so everybody can't eat somebody you're  just dead some motherfuckers just they don't have enough food to fucking eat why what because they're  lazy pieces of no i don't know i'm asking you why because look man look man some people can't look  when i grew up we we was on on welfare yeah and but i'm gonna be quite honest my mother was so was  i listen to me my mother was stealing it so was mine but okay she wasn't stealing it and i was 
[03:16:00]  walking around with the brand new nike she was stealing it working and on welfare yep just to get a little  bit more just some food some extra fucking food because to eat right a fucking fish one fish 75  dollars a pound a whole pig a dime you know what i'm saying like you can eat a whole fucking pig for  nothing and die or you can try to eat right and lettuce is this expensive or fish is that expensive 
[03:16:30]  or fucking something that's not gonna give you a fucking heart attack cost more money than the  average thing it's fucked up if you can come out of your goddamn shelby money and  fucking give me a piece of corn where does it fucking have to stop then do we all have to equal  out uh thank you thanks for saying it thanks for saying it thanks for saying when i grew up my  i remember being my mother having to you because when you go on uh we used to get fruits uh uh lunch 
[03:17:00]  tickets and i remember watching my father my mother made him fill out the thing so she can get a  little extra and i watched my father cry and i said and and uh i never understood but he hated the  fact that he had to subjugate himself to get a little extra that taught me so i'm i'm always going  to i believe that i'm going to be as human as possible of course if you work hard there's some  lazy motherfuckers out there that don't deserve you know to live in a great house right i'm not saying  that you shouldn't die like like the mortgage crisis here's the thing we do who thought it was a 
[03:17:30]  good idea to give a motherfucking make a 335 hour million dollar home exactly like who thought that  but who's who's who's the dumb motherfucker that looks at his budget and and decides okay but then  then we do then we do this that's fine i get that we'll bail out the bank that made the predatory loans  but not the people that took we'll bail out railroads that are shitty business model but not the people  that ride them we'll bail out the airline issues like after 9-11 we gave them billions of dollars and  they're a shitty business model and now seven of those people are going we'll give corporations chances 
[03:18:00]  that we'd never give human beings that's my problem if you go you you take welfare away from  poor people you say you ain't fucking working that though but you'll give those you'll give those same  tax breaks to exile and mobile who don't even need it and you don't blink an eye at it i i agree with  that to a point but the reason that the airlines uh got bailed out and and the railroads and stuff  is because we need fucking planes okay we might need planes you know this poor motherfucker that went broke  we don't need we don't need it's seven you know why airlines go broke that's why they're going 
[03:18:30]  but yeah because they're shitty business models because they they're late they pay too much money  and you know what happens to a shitty business model it goes away we don't need 19 000 airlines we  just need good ones and efficient ones you know the only airline that didn't have to lay out for  anybody or take any money from the government was southwest now everybody laughs at them and talks  about that they're a great business model they just they weren't fucking paying the mechanics to fix the  yeah but the thing about it is we will we will we look at corporations differently than we do look at 
[03:19:00]  people now i understand we need corporations but you would never you'll tell me how you shouldn't  bail out the people that made a predatory loan banks went ripping those people off left and right  and what they figured would happen they wouldn't be able to make the loan that payment and we'll get  the house back and can sell it again they didn't know they were going all of a sudden have a whole  soap out of the house they couldn't say i know but that that that people sometimes are fucking  stupid do you think you're getting 10 million dollars from nigeria in your email the bank 
[03:19:30]  you don't give a fuck and was the bank stupid the bank was no apparently the bank is pretty  fucking smart now they're going to foreclose on a house but now the banks are in trouble because  now they're stupid are there any people in need so so let's say it was two stupid people we just  told trolls the richer stupid person that's what happened we bail out any people in need that you  give a fuck about that you go man these people need help and i i i would like to help it's the  people on commercials that i never fucking see and you know who it is it's these fucking father mother 
[03:20:00]  and two kids in a homeless shelter that just ain't ever in a fucking homeless shelter they fell through  the cracks of society the husband lost his job this could happen to any man no it's a lunatic in a  snorkel jacket on a hundred degree day you're fucking going can i get some money that's the  fucking shit that's that's the needy that i don't give a fuck can you do the black snorkel homeless  man again can i have some money you know him oh fuck i know him a lot i have i have like there 
[03:20:30]  there are people i don't have tolerance i don't have a tolerance for bullshit yeah i don't either i'm  tired of people you know doing whatever the fuck they do but i chase mullet-headed white  fucking junkies away too i tell them go fuck yourself you ain't getting a quarter from me  i'm also tired of people like i just think three if the government did three four things i'd be fine  i think if they gave everybody a decent quality education i think if they protect gave you some  level gave isn't that in place hold on isn't that in place if someone does well in school 
[03:21:00]  how can you do i don't let me give you an example okay my kids went to school in inner  city of los angeles in 1996 i moved to the valley which is the same school district but it's the  valley los angeles school district my kids were three years and they were doing well at that school  three years behind those people three years they were doing shit at that school that we had never  even seen why i had to well i don't know why you tell that's just it why i can't tell you why  like i don't have the i don't have the why and plus that ain't a good joke why 
[03:21:30]  i don't know what the fuck that is you're fucking up my human interest you're an asshole  but but so i had to pay to this day to this day i had to pay tutors to catch my children up and  unfortunately i was able to do it my daughter goes to smith uh uh uh you know uh private cause i'm  very proud of my son is in college my daughter i'm she gonna be my daughter that's the fuck she  gonna be for the rest of her life but she ain't the brightest motherfucker no matter how much i pay  into this but but the idea that they go to the same school district that they worked hard that 
[03:22:00]  i thought i was doing everything i needed to do and they were still three years behind and you  asked me why and i tell you i don't know i can't tell you what because now it's richer out there so  i i think that there's more and certainly there's more involvement it used to be a pta you know parents  were there there's there's i don't think it's a hundred percent of one thing i think it's one  percent of a hundred thing i think the parents need to be more involved in their children's life  absolutely we need to place a higher premium on education but all of us do like i was reading  uh we don't none of us we have to give hundreds of thousands of work visas away because we're not 
[03:22:30]  educated enough to do the the job that involved mathematics we have to hire you know this child  this child thing has nothing to do with anthony no you know something let's move along from children  i pay motherfucking school taxes up the ass why where i am because i i don't have any kids but i got  to pay for the fucking schools in my neighborhood in my neighborhood i got to pay for the fucking  schools have because they don't want they don't want the kids fucking winging rocks through my  windows so even people without kids got to pay through the fucking ass for the school tax well 
[03:23:00]  fuck i don't give a fuck about that fuck the kids  the children should be homeless  yeah fuck the children a very a very special episode of  you joke around you joke around but they do use their fucking like five and six-year-old age  status to fucking get away with shit yeah  this motherfucker here 
[03:23:30]  and that's what i have to say about that  that's all thank you for listening to the last time  i can't wait to see richard huff's article tomorrow  opi straightens everyone out on this  opi's race discussion groundbreaking  yeah i do i'm going to be on the top of the the drudge report later today  opi solves race problems in america  yes we have to take a leak yeah yeah  deal hugley at carolines uh that was really interesting  two on two seven five seven forty one hundred he's there tonight through sunday

[03:25:00]  what we talked about during break hey uh that never happens we're back with the live studio  audience i i i want to uh do something really quick i need another threesome let's uh let's  get  let's get people uh i want to know how many people out there we have a very white audience looking at  us right now that's true and uh i want to know how many of these guys and gals are voting for  mccain raise your hand of course why would you even ask that's not look it's not even of course  shut up keep your hands up what do you want yeah one two three four five six seven eight it looks 
[03:25:30]  like right how many of you traders  so we got eight for mccain how many for obama there's a lot three  four oh two if that's the ratio it's over now wait out of 11 hold on hold on man bro what 
[03:26:00]  that's that's over 25 though i mean when you look at it like that three and eight is uh that out of  11 people that is over yeah but there's more than 11 so what's going on with the other guys you're  just that's what i'm saying maybe they're wigs some of them kept their hand down and then left it's  it's a dangerous thing what what happened who's they're on everybody's on your headphones yeah  no i have them so what did that guy he jumped up what oh i'm i'm definitely not voting for john  mccain no way it's ludicrous we've already lost 4 000 men in this war uh we definitely need to change 
[03:26:30]  in america and i think obama's pretty optimistic i certainly think he's qualified since uh deal mentioned  before where somebody had some thoughts while that's a sexual  i don't have to hand one up when the hand goes up it's going to be a  fucking wall dude you know what dude everybody's kind of just eating themselves you know what dude  black or white fat bob kelly what an ass point about obama not being being there for votes and 
[03:27:00]  voting present as opposed to voting yes or no a friend of mine made a point about that a lot of times  things go through and you don't want to go against the party but you don't want to support it either and  that's one of the reasons obama did have that voting record at least the guy was there  these motherfuckers aren't even there but that's my here's my thing i think politicians do what they  do to get it's like like i said earlier everybody's filling out this is the biggest job application  i don't know one motherfucker that tells the truth on a job application i don't know one so i don't look 
[03:27:30]  at politicians i i judge them and i kind of go they serve a purpose they good but i don't look at them as  being agents of change or goodness or what all they care about is what gets them elected that's  just it and gets them to the next day i agree with that shit i agree obama's doing that the same way  as everybody else i don't have a high sense of self-esteem uh of esteem for them if they're good at  their job but people can say whatever they want about george bush this is the one good thing i'll say  about him i don't even know what i can say but uh he said he didn't use slick talk and and great rhetoric 
[03:28:00]  and lilting rhetoric to get shit done he bullied people and he was politically effective like he did  he got shit done it was all the wrong shit but he he wasn't in there talking nice to those people  he's a he's like motherfucker you do it or i'm gonna make it politically hot for you he got a lot of  democrats that they lost their job so i think that he was a political he was politically effective just  all the wrong shit so i don't think you have to be nice i think that the people place are putting  politicians in places i don't think they belong i think they're just you know they're not civil 
[03:28:30]  rights workers they're not humanitarians these motherfuckers are trying to get a library  and that's why i keep him i mean he might be a great dude he can speak great i'm gonna vote for  him but don't don't expect me to suck his dick i just think he i just i think he's i hope he's good  at his game ask him oby ask if anybody's voting that knows nothing about politics uh what he said  i don't think anyone's gonna fess up for knowing nothing that's what i'm saying this is there's a 
[03:29:00]  there's a bunch you don't think you think there's a couple of guys over here that's just voting  because they just vote because that's who they go there's at least two or three dummies over there  and i think that that's more people than you fucking realize man let's go to stalker patty who are you  voting for in the upcoming election i think obama's the only candidate out of the three who would  out there that's capable of the three who's the three hillary and she dropped out hillary's out  yeah you know mccain's hillary's out she just said fuck that i'm gonna go on my ramp or she'll just 
[03:29:30]  keep talking people that aren't running i think that hillary i think gary hart's in trouble  i'm gonna say that and she's still talking patty i was interjecting humor do you know that hillary's  out of it yes i know that so why did you say three candidates with obama all along because  he's strong enough to handle it no you weren't you used to you badmouth him because you were for  hillary no i wasn't i remember that you were like obama i wouldn't vote for him he's too racially 
[03:30:00]  motivate you said all that did i no oh god i totally made that up you jedi mind tricked her  but but that exactly is who's voting she had no idea thank you jim that's perfect example  perfect example patrice can you vote you you're allowed to vote patty yeah exactly why not that's  what the that's who's vote excuse me that's who's vote well yeah yeah i'm glad hillary got out  because the race was taking her so she started to look like she started to look like willie nelson 
[03:30:30]  didn't she what was the model for the nickel for a little while  she looked like willie nelson but less fuckable i'm like baby go down take a nap i wanted to marry  us i could cheat on her she's not happy with a man unless his dick smells like someone else  oh my goodness oh well any other political commentary we haven't really gone to the 
[03:31:00]  the crowd well that's the big dude right there the big oh yeah bob kelly dude  bob kelly  what do you got buddy who you voting for uh mccain okay what do you like about mccain  other than his wife yeah exactly  look at patrice patrice has done nothing but for the past two hours and talk about how he's  only voting for but i'm saying no no no i'm not mad at that i'm saying he's white because this is 
[03:31:30]  what i mean white people can they're not allowed to just be honest they have to figure out a way  permission i'm just saying i'm vote for the i vote for dude because he's black but white people have  to go well his stance on no that's not true look at this motherfucker trying to make up some  shit i'm trying to try to give you an answer here uh don't like the uh liberals so uh i try to go 
[03:32:00]  that's fair wow republican by liberals he means the black people of course you know what i  but i don't give a fuck because i let me tell you something even if he came up with some magical  shit i still believe in what i believe so it's nothing i'm prejudging him and he's not going to  say anything that makes me go fair enough you made you made such a fair point against obama and for  mccain and i'm i'm open-minded like that but you're not i am 
[03:32:30]  i'm open-minded in terms of a motherfucker best logical you know if it makes sense i'm gonna go with  it dude he i believe that he's not voting for obama because he's black but he has to figure out  some shit that he hasn't even figured out let me ask you something honestly what if like i hate  conservatives okay i'm sure you gave me an example of armstrong williams or or i don't like them i  think that that no offense i like you but you know some of my best friends are conservative yeah but but  how come i would never extend somebody uh or deny somebody at right i feel like i have that's what 
[03:33:00]  that whole don imus thing it was about yes there you go if i'm allowed to do it somebody else should  be allowed the liberals were the ones who attacked him the only conservative conservatives defended him  especially especially speech i think black people black comedians should have been the first people  defending anything that had to do with language so i don't like conservatives i don't care if they were  black they were a woman they were the first midget i don't give a fuck what they were the first of  i don't like them why am i allowed to say i would never vote for him because they're conservative and he's 
[03:33:30]  not allowed to say he never i'm gonna tell you why it is what it fucking is right wait you know  it's not magic it's double standing and i'm not saying that i give a fuck that he can't it's just  white people white guilt see black people have a little to do with what the fuck y'all do to  yourselves it's it's some really some civil war happening with white people where you make each  other feel uncomfortable we don't even have a say in it white guilt is the thing that makes him not 
[03:34:00]  be able to go i don't i just don't want to blow for a black guy that's we didn't do that did you see  i was this is so i feel so stupid i was in the same four seasons we were at when we were doing the  in washington i was john zogby was there from the zogby writers poll and he i had lunch with him  it was the day after the pennsylvania primary 21 and he was talking about the exit poll 21 of the voters  there said the race was a problem that they would rather stay home than vote for uh uh uh obama 17 
[03:34:30]  of catholic voters there was catholic voters said that they would uh they would vote for they would  rather they stay home so that's 38 of that vote those are people who said out loud i ain't vote for  this they say they didn't say that out loud they said it no they said it behind something whatever they  said but they were open about it they said i can say i'm a vote for obama or whatever but when i go  only if they have cameras pointing right at you when you put when you push these buttons and you  go oh yes obama and you go whoops not that they can say what they want to say but outwardly white 
[03:35:00]  people aren't gonna go i'm not voting for him because he's black you'll never find it parts of  the country look at the west they voted for him in big numbers white people according to white people  there's there's no racism more in the west and they don't exist but not but not in the middle of  the country it's there but i've never met a racist i've never met one let's ask uh roland  roland who are you voting for m nine salomon salamon salamon yeah bill richardson because 
[03:35:30]  he's you know he's next to him he's voting for him what's that bruce springsteen supporting obama  oh that's cool and that's why that's really why he's right well that day roland's a huge springsteen  fan so whatever made a lot of people vote for him yeah but there's honesty patrice that's the  reason why roland's uh voting for obama still didn't say race though we talking about the  honesty of race though uh there's other things that play into this too but patrice is right again 
[03:36:00]  i'll give it to you i hate the whole white get the guilt thing and and that uh white people can't  just say the white the white guilt vote's gonna be big yeah you're right yeah it might be a lot of  white people just feel guilty and paternalistic like and they hope to god this will end racism  please let this in my in this inner horror that i have please one way or another either with peace  and love or through a race war i'm at moral uh a moral uh impasse i can't take it anymore but you 
[03:36:30]  know what's so funny everybody acts like this is uh this is the first time in history this has  happened like this is the most significant moment in modern history like and it's pretty significant  for this country but in south africa i think it was pretty significant that was a majority  majority was a prisoner was it the same democratic process though they voted they voted well you know  what the big thing was anything white a whole lot of africans yeah and a whole lot of dead white  people so i think i think that you gotta like you gotta put this uh i am very like part of me is like 
[03:37:00]  like i'm very proud to see something i'm very i always wait for the shit in the game to see what's  going on i'm very proud uh to see a black man um um ascending something i never thought barrier i  never even thought possible even when i did my hbs special i couldn't think that this was i couldn't  wrap my mind around it but i'm also a realist i don't believe and this is just and so do i don't i  think most politicians aren't shit and i think but that's i hold them a little business as usual 
[03:37:30]  absolutely agree all business i don't think this motherfucker i think he's a goddamn politician  right that's what i think he is so anybody who wants to be the president is a fucking sickening  crazy motherfucker anyway but fuck it but don't tell me you want the black don't tell me they're gonna  change the oh the world will be warmer and nicer uh your job is to do what the american people want  you to do that's your gig before doug williams all i wanted was doug williams now i want 
[03:38:00]  fucking who's gonna make my team win you know what i think before that i want doug williams man  too so would you take doug williams over time brady fucks no okay not now then i would have  i would have been that like that i want to see this happen you know what i think obama's gonna do not  now foreign policy i think he's gonna do much better because i think other other people in other  countries yeah i'm gonna remember when jesse went over to free that in in libya yes he got the  little uh hostages free just so the libyans could go go fuck yourself right we're giving him to jesse 
[03:38:30]  yes i i think he's gonna do better in foreign policy absolutely because i think the foreign uh  dignitaries are gonna know that like people gonna be like motherfucker they're gonna give  him some extra oil because he's black right take that with you take a couple of barrels just for  the rest of the country and you know what the people the economy is really all about like the global  economy economy is really all about emotion like people hate us right now yeah and they want to  like that ill will is in the zeitgeist people want us fucked over and broke that's the same reason 
[03:39:00]  that the iranian hostages were released it was it was a slap of carter for taking the shah right and  when uh right when protecting the shah of iran after the islam revolution second reagan got in the  the hostages were right they were said it was all slap in the face of jimmy carter but i think that  i think that i just i just have a problem with people acting like this is jesus like it's like man  you've never met one great human being who was a politician can you name something bigger in your 
[03:39:30]  lifetime than the possibilities no i'm not i'm not in the game no the possibility that a black dude gets  a great job that's what we're talking about that a black man gets a great job it's bigger than the  greatest thing in my life there's going to be some inner the same reason when you first saw roots  right you remember how you felt yeah but that was that was but when man when this motherfucker  gets up on there up on this goddamn podium and he says white babies are now illegal to eat  when when he gets up there and you see him getting ready to say i am the i am your president you can't 
[03:40:00]  help and you can't help but something take over man i'm proud of him for doing but this is a black  dude who's got a job who hopefully will do a great job it's gonna be bigger than that i hope he make it  just so i remember this conversation man you're gonna he's gonna be bigger than that deal i think  that that i'll be proud it is you guys are going to be 
[03:40:30]  a whole lot of patrice o'neil i'm the head of exxon hello how are you it's going to be a whole lot of  quiet and a whole lot of crying when that month yeah but what does that do  yeah it's for you it's motherfuckers gonna stop shooting each other maybe just  fucking maybe i mean i just wanna it's just something that you just go fuck man this month 
[03:41:00]  he is the boss even though it's not gonna change shit and i'm not gonna be able to walk down and  say hey white woman take your clothes off because it's the black president patrice needs so much you  needed something to hope for external hope you need hope that's a white that's a white trick i'm not  gonna let you do it honestly i believe i believe i'll be proud of him because he's a black man  who's been able to accomplish i was proud of kind of you know right but let me say it but let me say  him though fuck him i don't give a fuck about him every black man that does something great i can be 
[03:41:30]  proud of everyone that says he don't care who's nipsey fucking russell fuck that's for him  and geraldine was the first lady i'm gonna go i'm gonna go i'm gonna quit you a hundred percent  on what you're saying except for this one block between what you're saying what i'm saying is that  i want the symbol part means something to me man because it's gonna mean something to the country  it's gonna make white people feel a certain way no matter just because i'm black i'm gonna feel this 
[03:42:00]  certain kind of thing and just because white people are white and they have this funky fear  of all here it comes white slaves it's gonna make me feel good you're gonna like that okay  the fucking all right listen the the fictional change all right that doesn't make me feel like  i just it make it doesn't it's like spite and and it's not like it's right no it's not 50 points 
[03:42:30]  i don't go wow black man did it so by virtue i did it i go that's the cool thing when you would  did it in 1901 if kobe was the only nigga player i would have done this i i'm like i can i can make  it they compartmentalize for me i'm very proud that a black man is is has the possibility of ascending  to a place where i had no concept that it could possibly he was the most shocked when he won iowa  he was the most shocked motherfucker on stage everybody was about to go home and make my vice  presidential bumper sticker i'm proud but i'm proud of that but i also believe but the other part of 
[03:43:00]  my mind goes but this is just a dude who who it's frankly made everybody else believe he is very  it's very much that's all like the oj verdict that's what it is right you're gonna have what it is it's  it's it's it's not that we gave a fuck i'm putting it i'll speak for me it's not that i gave a  fuck whether oj did it or not he beat the game that was made up by the people that made up the game 
[03:43:30]  and he and he fucking got off when that's what was happening all these years that's how slow it was  for me but the president he's about to be the president he's about to be the president with the  fucking game that you created and when i say you was i huh um you know probably in the show  i meant to say i meant to say you people he's playing the game that he's supposed to play yeah 
[03:44:00]  but i just want to see it happen i i i like that he i like that he beat the game and they hate this  motherfucker i'd like that he did but they've been giving hillary they was giving hillary shit  but it's crazy he gets great people love bra they hate hillary yeah they love bra the media was  feeding oh no you can't say that you can't say no not at all are you serious they like that just to  help her out they know soundbites like that they just like both of them beating back in heads 
[03:44:30]  together no matter what you think this is the truth if enough white people don't vote for him he ain't  gonna be present so if if there is that that's what i'm saying if there's that if they're adamant  so they got to buy into what you're saying i don't care if it's white so we i don't care if  people believe you got to start killing white they have to  they have to say we believe and for whatever reason you have to do it i think for me i'm going 
[03:45:00]  to be proud of a black man like i said doing something that but i just don't have and i can't do it  anything that white people do when it comes to obama whether it's vote for him or vote against him  i'm questioning it yeah until he's president and it's all over and i can go he there was one and  now i can listen to a white president goes i'm gonna vote for him because i think he's the best  and then i'll just go god fuck you you white guilt i have no regard for what white people say in terms 
[03:45:30]  of the president right now so bad that that's the reason so many white people will vote for obama  because bush so bad that's right they will turn their back on the party on anyone that looks like  bush anyone that acts like what that's 25 but you're 25 i'm talking to 25 right now he is big  enough to be 25 and i'm talking to a quarter of motherfuckers all that shit you're talking you 
[03:46:00]  think that he he's he's thinking oh there are some staunch party liners that ain't gonna  fucking vote anything close to a liberal i wouldn't vote anything close to a liberal i i  fucking like my guns am i a liberal love my guns no i don't you're you're more independent than anybody  uh so i can have a gun and a hooker and we right then i'll vote for that  if i can have i i just love if you have a gun you don't need a hooker yeah you do  oh swim walk swim walk come on i want to go back to stalker patty because he's gonna vote for obama i 
[03:46:30]  want to know stalker patty what does obama believe in you're you're actually voting what do you like  about obama yeah what's his platform that you uh that he wears platform that's what we're gonna see  what is it about because you've said many times that you have a lot of racial animosity against  black people what is it about it's okay you said that many times what is it about obama that you 
[03:47:00]  like politically yeah politically well he seems like he's more flexible i think he's going to be  able to do the job that was very very specific wow flexible that's good yeah that's pretty yes  he practices yoga politics and stuff like that ask the average american why they're voting for  somebody you would get answers just yes patrice is right yeah that's exactly what patrice says but  also black people same thing yeah anyone who's voting this is the type of answer well you know she  has no one really knows what these thank god for the stand for that's why i'll say what i'll say 
[03:47:30]  that's why i can't be bothered i don't give a shit i don't give a shit and stuff like that never the  sign of a fucking smart thank god for the electoral college that's why because the motherfuckers like  her they know they didn't trust the motherfuckers like her i don't want to you're not gonna vote for  obama no what's that no you're gonna vote mccain yeah he could handle the pressure and mccain is not  that there's a great discussion going on both patty is saying she thinks that you think mccain is not 
[03:48:00]  as strong as obama no what did you say patty because we were talking over you seriously back up  you think he could handle the pressure yeah i think he can and jimmy goes and mccain can after  he's upside down by his shoulders for five years by men with tiny genitals  he's like 72 years old and has all these health issues and everything he might stop in the middle 
[03:48:30]  of the four years and uh have the vice president take over i don't know if he's gonna be a horrible  thing but anytime your brother if your birthday got 19 oh anything that you should be president  so you know you're not going to vote for you would never vote for obama no and and you know  something and i'd be honest like patrice doesn't think i'd be i don't like his politics i don't like  that he's too he's too liberal for me and i don't see and i don't like i don't like mccain but yeah 
[03:49:00]  i don't like mccain either he's too he's a little too far right so who's left that's what i'm saying  you you you take it when i see the point he's getting ready to make you're gonna you're gonna  vote just because you have to vote for the part i would never if if if i don't like politicians  but i like enough of what obama says that i can vote for him i would never vote for somebody i  didn't like he's but he's making sure that i wouldn't do it obama is the more of two evils  for anthony he's making sure by his vote going against obama i'm making the lesser of the two 
[03:49:30]  he just makes sure that he's gonna he's gonna help obama not be president as opposed to helping  mccain be the president he's just he's just trying to make sure obama's words in my mind  the same thing you're saying though basically you're saying you're voting the black i'm just  voting for the white guy i'm just voting for the white guy hold on i'm saying if i didn't believe  enough in him yeah i wouldn't do it more importantly i gotta ask how nervous are you getting anthony because 
[03:50:00]  d.l is getting closer and closer to you and i'm moving over the same way  d.l hugley oh you vote for a bubble motherfucker that's right just like your neighborhood in january  it's a visual but d.l hugley started his appearance way the  fuck over here creeping over and you know and we've been  oh that's funny and we believe almost the same thing like you you but you you you believe i mean  literally you believe i believe a man should have a right to carry guns i believe that he should 
[03:50:30]  the woman should have an have the right to have an abortion i don't believe that the government is  i believe government's too big i don't believe that they should be the end all i think that they  should be less out of they should be out of businesses business and and less in our business  i think that uh uh uh i just we're more libertarian we're more libertarian than either  democrat or republican i would never vote for a dude like patrice was saying i couldn't if i didn't like  obama enough i couldn't do it i think he's a politician i think they're all full of  shit i don't put him up on the shelf and go oh i'm gonna worship and a glow comes i don't do all 
[03:51:00]  this and i go he's a he's a tool he's a functional dude who's supposed to do a job if i vote for him  because i think he's capable of doing the job yeah yeah you are saying you're voting the party line  uh no i'm voting for mccain because uh more of his ideas uh that he has are more okay he has more  than obama has i have more in common with what he believes in than obama believe you have more  in common with obama no no because i have literally nothing in common i mean ideology as 
[03:51:30]  far as the politics goes which is probably a bunch of bullshit anyway they just say the  shit to get into office well i have a black wife and three black kids so well he has two  whatever yeah so that's not what in common you have i've never been tortured so i guess i don't  have much not even today yeah sure you have you're married for nine years okay that's true  hey some good instant feedback coming in blue healer from kentucky writes i thought today was friday  the 13th not black friday i told you i told you and then rich b from iowa he goes opie you saved a

[03:56:00]  right it happens to be that you're a white guy and i'm a black guy and that's what all it all comes  down that's what it boils down but society puts that on us patrice i don't see you like that when  you come in here i see patrice o'neill come in here a friend that i know i could have uh in-depth  discussions with and shit i don't you know it's not like oh boy here comes one of those people  because you can have the kind of conversation that a white guy would just want to have without me i'm 
[03:56:30]  just one of those motherfuckers that like like we went through it i just believe in what i believe in  and you know like i'm not super black on some things and then i'm so like this like the obama  situation it i think i don't even know what people stands up i think he should tell his wife to shut  the fuck up like yeah the way i feel it's like she's a loose it's like man shut the fuck up shut  the fuck up don't talk when i'm when motherfuckers is interviewing me she runs the house go in the back 
[03:57:00]  and cook cook do some shit but you can tell she runs she runs the house when he's not doing his  political man fuck that you can't be the president it looks like your wife is running he does look  like one of those little skinny guys though that the the wife really fucking puts in in his place  when yeah they're not even though even though again like i said i have a degree in white people  white people love hunted child black bitches they love a black woman that's like  let me tell i run the country y'all they were like yay 
[03:57:30]  oh we like in the movie when it's played by queen latifah they want their black men he might  this might be a fucking smart ploy by him because they want their black men very soft and their black  women very hard so you think he's very soft it's when when she's around well i'm shit i ain't gonna  lie he does i'm talking shit because my wife he he changes i know it patrice is gonna say he changes  when she's when she's around he yeah he kind of yeah i don't he gets a little body language changes 
[03:58:00]  he gets nervous when she's around i i'm not i'm i can really my wife got an argument with me the  other day because we changed our life insurance policy and i got a big one on me and nothing  i heard she said uh what happened to you guys if something happened to me we'll be sad but that's  too much that's it that's it i mean that's it i mean that's it damn i'm the important  i gotta i gotta be sad that this bitch is dead i mean i mean really i mean and so but i but if i 
[03:58:30]  said that like she gets mad because the bank calls me when she writes a check i'm like right  because if we if we break up i'm gonna still be doing business with them that's the deal to  trickle down like if something happened to me you guys would move to section eight housing i am more 
[03:59:00]  i am more important than you they don't get it right yeah that's it i'm running for the president  what are you running for i couldn't i could see how it feels because i could it somebody's  gonna tell her i said that and then about watch we put my phone right here in about 10 minutes  she what was you know i'm not important to me but not to the bank but i love you but  watches the music and really not and really not that important to me  this is what you really want to say no i don't want to say that

[04:00:30]  this this is called all that shit oh yeah fair enough but but my thing is this a successful  relationship is based on a woman's ability to tolerate bullshit like uh uh like uh every  woman who's with in a relationship for a long time has had to put up with a certain level  of bullshit but see the bullshit is this the now you said now you had you've had  you've had you got the thing with the kids like where you go hey she's not gonna but but let's be 
[04:01:00]  honest right you could do a three with her and she could still make no no i just that's when  here's the thing i've never uh uh it's it's it's certain that i want my wife to do and a certain  shit that i i do with other people to take pressure off her because she's not double joining  and she can't keep a secret so those things i just it's just me i just i just would rather  have my mistress do a threesome then then then why am i is this mic on really no no i just i just

[04:03:00]  if you if you do a threesome with your wife you will see that it will change  how you think this certainly does my wife went right out the fucking door  i love my wife this is what happened about about 12 about 14 years about 17 years ago i had another  baby on the side okay and it was real and and i got caught and told her about and everything you  know my wife said to me why wouldn't you tell me and we would have dealt with it together and when  she said that i went hey man how could that her first concern was why didn't you tell me and i would 
[04:03:30]  have dealt with it with you so we saw the bride who i had the baby with in the airport and she  thought she was going to be able to come up to my wife and she said i already and the baby you know  got passed on and all that my wife said to the woman i already know what happened uh because  the girl was walking up like she's gonna tell all my business my wife said to her i already know  what happened i feel your pain and i love my husband and left she's a soldier your wife's a  soldier fuck all that i got to stay with you yes she's a soldier that may i mean i can't you're she  you're loyal but see we're not i love her i'm not loyal no you're loyal if i was so i wouldn't be

[04:05:00]  say to her it's his happiness i would never say to her like i would never leave for another woman i  would never hang out i would never like is that's never gonna happen i just dig broads and i dig them  like like not even i they're wonderful they are man and let me tell you what happened there was a there  was a crisis where this conversation happened and she there was a choice she leave or she figure out  a way to make this work and stay and that's why she's a trooper she figured out a way to make this 
[04:05:30]  happen it's just like the threesome some motherfuckers are like i  fuck that how you do that i did the three he made the same kind of thing happen where it's like look  this kind of gotta happen and she said it's like a trip slip i'm i'm i'm going to but i don't i hate  that about myself i wish that i could just will you shut the fuck up i really do will you just stop  but at least i do hate that about myself i don't go this is i don't believe you this is just like

[04:07:00]  why is she comfortable with this i'm talking a lot of but is that it or is there something else  that seems like the obvious answer but maybe there is something i'm talking a lot of  shit i would never and i i don't walk around i'm fucking brides i don't everywhere i go i'm  the sum of this is i'm putting on i'm just telling my most like and she knows i'm gonna say the most  humans i always try to tell the truth as you're in all the book and people understand in all this  what you're saying what he's saying is he will not disrespect his wife right right right no matter 
[04:07:30]  what's going on she wins right right watch i tell my girl right right you would you the general the  general comes with said you are a two-star general i run the whole military force right  but you are high level we these bitches can't win patrice we uh we've had your girl on the show  like uh i think it was with the russian uh playboy she was on the phone she was on the phone and you  you talk a cocky game but man you you back down when your your girl was on the phone and i would be  the man would just stop please find that tape i didn't back down at all because there's no back 
[04:08:00]  down matter of fact that would i'm gonna find the tape for the next time because if you ask her  if you if she calls she definitely has a bit more power in the relationship than you give her  our relationship was on the way out that day whoa because she commented on shit that was going on  in my in this world well i didn't like the way you say yeah my wife does that and i'm like this is  this is more important than you like this is how i'm dead ass what this is more important i just bought 
[04:08:30]  her 10 pair of shoes because of comments about dr motherfucking what's that yeah so shut the  fuck up don't that was the day because i could deal with a lot of arguments i try to walk her through  shit where she gets womany where they have to be walked through but she fucking was saying i didn't  like what you said that day on the radio and i said this is where it it can go bad for us because i 
[04:09:00]  can't have you i can't have me have any editing system in here thinking that that's gonna fuck with  your head right you have to be better than that if you can't be better than that then where i have to go  i have to be by myself that was that day if you have a filter like my wife that's that's the thing i got  to be able to get on stage and say i feel like uh the shit that happens she'll say please don't  talk about this and i go you know here's what maybe i won't i'll make you a promise that i won't be 
[04:09:30]  glib when i do it like i'm not gonna just be i'm not it ain't gonna just be fucked up and i'm just gonna  but you it's a shared experience i had it you had it so we're gonna talk about it but to me the whole  thing about this is like people only dig me because of what i do for a living i get it but these are  bitches i would have never got the fuck so i'm like my mother i would just share your toy so  i understand this one off i pulled off threesomes and this nigga pulled off actually i have other  women no which is what i want to pull off but i want to pull off a family i want to i want to do 
[04:10:00]  it utah style that's my shit i want a house full of bitches just walking around and i'm daddy hey we  didn't even get to talk to red today man he's one of my faves right there he is he knows red you  enjoying the show today or what thumbs up you got anything to say or add to this an original  ultimate war i'm a gladiator an original we're trying to make him wear his uniform sometime  get in here for a second what get in here saber and i want some respect for red he's one of the 
[04:10:30]  original american gladiators one of the original dudes man saber now was he saber he said you were  saber yes sir saber saber we're in the house hey you know they have repeats of that on uh classic yes  sir yes sir yes sir why aren't you don't not try to be a good dude i'm not a good dude he is a uh trip  now i know what club soda kenny would look like if he was black we got uh the black club soda kenny  i had something to say earlier when uh when uh when uh when uh he was talking about jackie 
[04:11:00]  robertson being the first and vote for the black dude just because he's the black dude the reason  why he was the first and he wasn't the best is because they had to have the guy with the right  temperament or at least they felt he had to have the right temperament but what you were saying was  vote for him just because he's black which means that satchel page or josh or anybody could have been  the first no i was waiting for the best one i didn't finish that that whole thing because it was like  heated at the moment but i'm saying that but we on two bitches now this yeah yeah i don't have drama 
[04:11:30]  like both y'all so i'm gonna buy out on the bitches can i i want to jump in because i learned something  today about the whole jackie robinson thing yes sir i think if jackie robinson was like flavor  flav oh boy oh yeah yeah so it had to be the right black guy and that's what i'm saying that's what i'm  saying about obama i just think he's the guy even if he's not the right guy he's the guy that  can't do it but you said you vote for armstrong williams over the job but you said i have hope 
[04:12:00]  i'm it's making me believe i just have hope we almost got out oh no we're back we're back to  pussy i can switch right back up but it's the same day somebody get lucky to eat the cake  i just want to make sure red was having a good time today the question is would you  fuck would you fuck michelle obama or mccain no that gets fired won't it like i mean you can't  you can't can't say that i don't know it's a hypothetical situation who's hotter
