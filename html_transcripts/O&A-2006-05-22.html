<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic whirlwind of topics, united only by the hosts' signature brand of offensive humor and frequent tangents.  The show opened with Opie, Anthony, and James Norton engaging in self-deprecating insults and boasts. Anthony recounted a brutal two-day hangover following a Brian Regan stand-up show, detailing his excessive alcohol consumption and Regan's surprisingly foul-mouthed behavior when drunk.  This led to a discussion about drunk driving, with Anthony proudly recounting his near-misses with the law while intoxicated, followed by Norton sharing his own struggles with substance abuse and past run-ins with the authorities, including calls to the FBI.  A caller, Tony the trucker, mentioned their appearance on Hannity and Combs, prompting a discussion of their dual roles on XM Satellite Radio and CBS, further fueled by a Boston caller's dislike of their CBS show.  The hosts then briefly updated listeners on the injured Preakness Stakes horse, Barbaro, before launching into a discussion of Jim McGreevy's tell-all book detailing his sexual encounters with men at rest stops and bookstores, punctuated by the hosts’ humorous, and often crude, speculation about the specifics. The segment ended with a discussion of nude imagery preferences in magazines, specifically Playboy vs. hardcore pornography, and a tangent about a distracting short skirt.

The next segment began with a discussion of lingerie preferences, specifically "bulging and packed" white boy shorts. This quickly transitioned to a discussion of a vintage baseball league in Central Park, critiquing its lack of Black players and antiquated equipment. The conversation then shifted to graphic descriptions of injuries and emotional trauma depicted in the documentary *Baghdad ER*, followed by mockery of New York City’s hurricane preparedness and criticism of the media’s perceived bias in covering the Iraq War, initially expressing support for the war before expressing doubts about the Bush administration's justifications. This segued into a discussion about a naked woman across the street whose window coverings were now consistently drawn, followed by listener calls regarding local news bloopers, a Jersey political race with harsh accusations, and inappropriate behavior among medical professionals.  The segment concluded with listener calls and a discussion of a Paltalk pajama party featuring online video streams with varying levels of clothing, and a promotion for Jim Norton's upcoming shows at the Stress Factory.

A significant portion of the following segment focused on a listener's account of a Paltalk pajama party and the hosts' crude jokes about the listener's claimed security measures (or lack thereof).  This evolved into a debate with listeners criticizing their use of Paltalk, its adult content, and their overall behavior.  The segment included a "walk" segment with offensive comments made to passersby, discussions of Norton's massage experience and Opie's awkward yoga session, and concluded with the "Daily Dump Report" detailing censored segments, further sparking discussion on censorship and FCC regulations.

The final segment started with Opie's fixation on seeing the time as 9:11, followed by a story about mistaking a MiFi device for a ghost. This led to a discussion of Opie's morning routine, Michael Hebranco's morbid obesity (with Opie expressing extreme disgust), and addiction. A caller pointed out the irony of Opie's "like clockwork" alarm comment. The hosts discussed fan websites and negative comments, particularly "Whack Bag," with Opie revealing his own checking of fan sites and a thread criticizing his laugh.  Callers offered solutions to Opie's nighttime visual disturbances and expressed agreement with their frustration towards overly negative fan sites.  A significant portion was dedicated to an email from No Filter Paul inviting Opie and his girlfriend to sushi, which Opie vehemently rejected with graphic and vulgar descriptions of his imagined perception of Paul and his wife's sexual activities; E-Rock's attempts to retrieve the deleted email were also mentioned.  The segment included listener calls, discussions about a "Columbine" video game, bad movie sequels, and an audio clip of Richard Simmons emotionally reacting to Hebranco’s weight.

Throughout the broadcast, there was further discussion of Richard Simmons, his weight loss methods, and Michael Hebranco, utilizing crude and offensive language, with frequent homophobic and fatphobic commentary.  The hosts compared Hebranco's perceived failure to maintain weight loss with a colleague's perceived success, utilizing offensive stereotypes. Other topics included a song about a woman hindered by an overweight friend, a sexually explicit "True Confessions" segment, a *Sopranos* episode review, Bodog.net's planned integration with the show, Elton John's public outburst, *The Da Vinci Code* controversy, the number of ribs in men and women, a seven-year-old attempting an Alcatraz swim, and further speculation about Barbaro's fate, with more offensive jokes about potential headlines.  The show concluded with more banter and off-topic conversations.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rapid radio retards.  Wow, we're dummies.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show. 
[00:00:30]  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating poob that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[00:01:00]  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Ugh.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hello, exactly!  Liar, whore!  Liar, whore!  And you know it! 
[00:01:30]  Couple of very beautiful girls, you know what?  Who are you tonight?  The Kit Kat Club?  Fancy talk!  Fancy talk for a whore!  Shut your goddamn piehole!  Do you want to kiss me?  I'm going to kiss you on the mouth. 
[00:02:00]  You know, you sound just like my ex-husband.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  What is it?  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  It's Monday!  Damn it!  Ugh.  Ugh.  Why does every week have to start with Monday?  Ugh. 
[00:02:30]  It's just such a chore, isn't it?  It's there to make you appreciate Friday more.  Yeah.  That old gag.  You ever listen to the lyrics of Manic Monday by the Bengals?  It's true.  Uh-huh.  Ugh.  All right.  1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  If you got something for the program.  What's going on, Anthony?  Oh.  I'm feeling much better than I did over the weekend. 
[00:03:00]  Nursed one of those...  I haven't had one of these in years.  One of those two-day hangovers.  Woke up Saturday.  Oh.  Just hungover.  And then thought it would be gone.  Spent all day just eating like chicken soup.  And drinking water.  Drinking ginger ale.  And I had like the wet rag on my head.  And I'm just laying there watching television the whole day.  It was that bad, huh? 
[00:03:30]  I feel like my eyes were just going to fly out of my head.  Everything that I thought of as far as food that wasn't kind of cold and juicy.  Like grapes were good food to eat at that time.  And soup.  But anything dry like a sandwich or something.  Just the thought of it made me like...  Did you puke?  Didn't puke.  Should have puked.  Didn't puke.  Didn't puke.  Should have puked.  Didn't puke.  Yeah, it was...  Puking would have taken care of everything.  That's what they say, but... 
[00:04:00]  That alcohol just sitting in you all weekend.  You got to be hungover still.  For someone that enjoys drinking as much as I do,  my hangovers have always been horrid.  Just horrid.  The headache doesn't go away.  That queasy feeling.  And just that I don't want to do anything.  So I spent all day just trying to sleep on and off Saturday.  And then Sunday rolls around.  I think I'm going to feel better.  I wake up.  Still had a headache.  Still felt like crap.  And it was all from Friday night. 
[00:04:30]  Friday night I decided to go out.  And it's the late show that gets you.  Usually when I go to Caroline's for a show,  I go to the early show, the 8 o'clock show.  But we decided, because we wanted to go to dinner first,  to do the 10 o'clock show for Brian Regan.  The hysterical Brian Regan.  He killed the Carolines.  He killed.  The place is packed.  He's one of those comics that just...  I mean, you look around the audience,  there's old people, young people,  all different races. 
[00:05:00]  The guy hits the nail on the head with everybody.  It's just amazing watching a comic like him.  And all clean.  All clean stuff.  So we go there to the late show.  And at dinner, at first, you know,  I have a couple of...  We've goofed about this before.  A couple of the old chocolate martinis.  They're so tasty.  I've kind of gotten away from the hardcore manly drinks.  I used to be a Jack and Coke with shots of Jack and beer guy. 
[00:05:30]  And Captain Morgan and Cokes.  That's pretty much it.  Now I'll have a couple of chocolate martinis.  Way to go, McGreevy.  Way to go, McGreevy.  I'm out at the truck stops.  Wait till we get into the McGreevy story in a while.  Jersey, something to be proud of.  You order a chocolate martini,  you should actually hear a man's zipper open  as they serve it to you.  Mo.  But it's kind of like... 
[00:06:00]  They're very delicious.  Yeah, it's kind of like a dessert.  Yeah, and it gets you, like, really buzzed pretty quickly.  A lot of vodka in there.  They go down easy.  Trying to make them sound manly.  They go down so easy,  you don't even think you're drinking, right?  And that's what it is with me.  I don't want to feel like I'm really pounding.  But apparently, that kind of set it up.  So I had a couple of those.  Had a pretty good buzz on for my crosstown drive  from the restaurant to the comedy club.  Yeah, because when I saw you, man... 
[00:06:30]  Keep it on the QT.  When I saw you, you were like...  I was already buzzing.  Holy cow.  Yeah, because I went to the same show,  and you're cheering the screen,  and oh, I was making fun of that.  That was before I was...  You were very vocal, though.  You're usually very low-key.  Low-key, yeah.  Especially in public.  Yeah, I was having a good time.  You were pretty much working the whole room  before Brian Regan came in.  Had peeps with me.  A lot of people recognized us,  so people were coming up to the table.  And yeah, I was having a good time.  And then I just figured, 
[00:07:00]  eh, a little wine.  A couple of glasses of the old charades.  This is after the chocolate martinis?  Yeah.  Oh, I'm mixing like crazy.  So after that...  That's going to be a problem.  Then I decide,  I ask the waitress,  I go,  you know,  I want to do a shot,  but I don't want to do like tequila  or Jack or anything like that.  I want to bring me some kind of wimpy shot.  You know?  Just wimpy shots.  All right.  Get you some Baileys and Amaretto.  That's tasty.  Comes in a shot. 
[00:07:30]  You have the fun of doing a shot.  But those kept coming.  So I'm really starting to like feel it.  And like I said,  it was a late show.  So Brian gets done with his set,  and we all head out to the bar.  And shots continue.  Drinks continue.  Fans coming up.  Apologize if I said anything mean,  but I don't remember talking to any fans.  I hear they were there.  I don't think you said anything mean  because I'm looking at pictures this morning.  Looks like you made all sorts of new friends.  All sorts of friends. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, that's a picture.  Looks like some old enemies  have become your best of pals.  There's a picture of me  and Paul Mercurio hanging out.  Paul opened up for Brian  and was hanging out that night  and me and him were chatting  and drinking  and I look at Jim.  Okay.  And Brian, of course,  hung out the whole night  and we wound up closing Caroline's.  So we go around the corner 
[00:08:30]  because it's not time to just stop drinking.  We go to some bar around the corner  and then the shots of tequila started.  Now, I don't do tequila at all.  So I was just drinking some more wimpy shots.  But Than was with us.  Nathaniel was with us  and Brian doing the tequila.  And oh, I must say,  I'm not going to repeat anything,  but there is truly a dark, evil side to Brian Regan.  He gets a few in him. 
[00:09:00]  Holy Jesus.  Well, his mouth is worse  than when we go over to the XM show.  He gets dirty.  His anger with other people comes out.  Please tell me he dropped the M-bomb a few times.  Dude.  Okay, I will.  It was fabulous.  You could destroy the guy.  That's just his release.  I won't say what context it was in or anything,  even though I could say no context. 
[00:09:30]  It was hysterical.  The guy's a scream.  So I wind up,  I actually had enough sense to know  that if I pulled out of the parking garage,  the second my tires hit the street,  I'd have heard,  whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  It would have been all over.  So I had to get a hotel here in town  and didn't get there,  didn't check in.  until the sun came up.  And they're like squinting  at the sun coming up,  walking into the hotel. 
[00:10:00]  It was that early in the morning.  It was later than when we come to work here.  And went to sleep there,  woke up,  and just felt like crap.  So you went in the morning,  like six in the morning,  so you had to get an early check-in  for the next day,  so you didn't have to get up by noon, right?  No.  No, it was pretty much  you check in,  you're checking out  by their checkout time.  Ew.  But I'm a regular at there,  so I have no checkout time.  I've slept until four  in those rooms  a lot of times. 
[00:10:30]  Believe me,  I've given them enough business.  But, oh,  I haven't had a night like that  in years,  and now I know why.  Two days.  Yeah, the two-day hangover stinks.  When you're in your kitchen,  like,  with just your pajama bottoms on  going through the fridge,  and every move you make,  your head pounds,  and you're looking at a pear going,  could I keep that down?  A pear. 
[00:11:00]  And I had to sit there  and cut the pear up into chunks  because I didn't have the strength  to, like,  bite into it  like a fruit,  like a real man.  Like a real mammal.  I know.  I was all screwed up.  Why don't you just jam your fingers  down your throat, man?  He's right.  Get the liquor out of you,  you'd be fine.  Yeah, when I'm in that situation,  I just go for the  couple fingers down the throat.  You got them.  I was past that point.  You got to get it out of you.  Whatever was in me  had already been absorbed in.  Puking at that point  wasn't going to do anything.  Blood poisoning level. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, it was blood poisoning.  And it was over.  I just had to, you know,  deal with it.  Two days.  Felt better yesterday, though,  but really didn't do much of anything.  I had one of those nights  at FH Riley's.  Yeah.  One of the first nights  the restaurant was open.  And it was the same thing, man,  because I'd like,  my drinking is way behind me.  Way behind me.  I'm like a glass of wine,  maybe a beer,  maybe a bikini-tini  if I'm on vacation  with the girlfriend's family. 
[00:12:00]  Ooh, bikini-tini.  You make fun of chocolate martini.  And I was at the restaurant  drinking the lemon drop martinis.  Yeah.  And it tastes like  you're just drinking lemonade.  Certainly does.  And we went there,  we had dinner  and like a glass of wine.  No big deal.  I wasn't going to drink.  And then someone,  one of the fans, you know,  said you want to drink.  I'm like,  yeah, I'll try one of those  lemon martinis.  They sound,  lemon drop martinis.  They sound good.  I had about eight of them.  Eight of them.  And you feel like 
[00:12:30]  you're not drinking.  Yeah.  And then it catches up to you.  And I had the same freaking thing  where I woke up in the,  woke up,  I couldn't even like,  I couldn't even lay down  for more than 30 seconds  without the worst,  you know,  spins ever.  Start spinning.  So I spent the whole night  just pacing back and forth,  back and forth  from the bathroom  to the bed,  just puking.  Oh God.  That is aggravating.  Coming out both ends,  like my muscles  just completely gave in.  And I was this close  to calling 911.  I'm like,  what the hell  did I do to myself? 
[00:13:00]  You drank yourself  into a stupor.  And then the same thing,  the next day,  you know,  it's checkout time.  I put the sign up  so the maids  don't bother us and stuff.  And then I turn on the TV  and it was that blizzard  that came in  where it snowed  the most ever  in New York City  a couple months back.  So I was forced  to drive back to the city  in the worst shape  I've probably ever been in.  Yeah,  it really sucks  when you have to drive  because then I had to get up  from the hotel  and drive back to Long Island  and you just...  You still feel it, right? 
[00:13:30]  You still feel it.  You're woozy.  You just want to get home.  But the point I'm making  is like,  you would never drink  like whiskey or scotch  to that point.  No.  Because you're so aware  of how much alcohol  you're throwing  into your system.  Yep.  You know,  the only point I want to make here  is that some of these  fancy martini drinks  that don't taste like  you're even drinking alcohol.  And you're like,  oh, that went down easy.  Yeah, I'll have another one.  Oh, yeah, I'll have another one.  You know what else?  Also, if you drink scotch,  if you're drinking  Jack Daniels like that, 
[00:14:00]  you're done in two hours.  Two hours,  you will be done.  At least you can like  stretch it out  to an all-nighter  because that was one  of those all-night deals  when you're drinking  the faggy drinks.  You know?  It's not like you're...  The end result  will be the same.  You'll be hammered  and have a horrible hangover.  Right.  But at least you enjoyed  your whole night.  That's what it is about drinking.  It's so much fun  when you're doing it.  And then when you're done,  there's nothing but pain 
[00:14:30]  and your body is just a wreck.  Yeah.  You remember that, Jimmy?  How long have you been sober?  Since I was 18,  I'm 37.  18.  Jimmy had to give up  drinking at 18.  And drugs.  It was just...  It had reached  its critical mass  at 18.  God, that sucks.  I was a naughty boy.  I was misbehaving.  You were misbehaving.  I remember one time  I got drunk.  One of my first drunks.  It might have been  my first drunk  and I was talking  to my friend.  He worked at a supermarket 
[00:15:00]  and I didn't like  the way he shook my hand.  I just kind of vaguely  remember later  my friends having to  stop me from going back in  because I had a box cutter.  Because I didn't like  the way he shook my hand.  That could be a problem then.  That could be a problem.  See, you probably  were a nasty drunk.  I take from that story  a nasty drunk.  I was a goose.  Yeah.  A silly, silly goose.  Called the FBI.  I was an ass.  I'm a happy, happy drunk.  Oh, yeah.  Did you tell that story  in the air?  I don't remember.  I might have.  I mean, yeah, yeah, 
[00:15:30]  I did call the FBI.  See, it's a good thing  then that you stopped  drinking at 18.  Yeah.  You called the FBI.  Yeah, I don't know why.  It was something  about a Klan march  I didn't like  so I kept calling the FBI.  It was something bizarre.  Oh, they'll pay attention  when you keep calling them.  They'll come and see you.  Yeah, I got a Klan  on the phone one time.  I read about him  in a book  when I was in high school.  You know, I was all young.  What, were you pissed  that you couldn't get in?  No.  No, it was just the opposite.  I was angry.  How could you think that way, man?  Well, because you were  what they call a wigger  back in the day.  Yes, I was.  You dressed the part. 
[00:16:00]  You liked the music.  But the only problem was  the eager part of it  didn't want to accept you.  That's embarrassing.  You would be beat up  in various parts of the city.  There's very few things  that embarrass me.  That's one of them.  Yo, B.  What up?  Yeah, let me punch you  in the face.  Oh, my glasses  and my kangaroo.  What a faggot.  That is the worst.  So you did things like that,  like call the FBI and just...  I called the police one time 
[00:16:30]  and demanded that they arrest me  and I talked to them  in a Jamaican accent.  Why?  I don't know why.  I just, I was kind of like  half and half  out of a blackout  and I remember I had a big knife  and I said,  Oh, wow.  I kept telling them  to come arrest me  and I walked down  and made them arrest me  and they did  and I wanted to go home  and they wouldn't let me.  I was like 16.  What did you drink?  I don't remember.  It was a lot.  Just a lot of something.  Alcoholic.  Jamaican accent.  I'm a fool.  You got that.  And it's been since you were 18.  February the 1st of 87,  I stopped.  And do you think  if you drank now  you'd turn into that ass again? 
[00:17:00]  No, I would probably be great  and have like a lighthearted good time  for a couple of months  and then one night  I would just wake up in jail  with blood on my shoes.  Yeah.  Well, yeah,  I've always been  a very happy, fun drunk  to be around  but it just,  it takes its toll  where you just wake up.  We talk about your drinking  from time to time.  Anthony's amazing  because his demeanor  barely changes.  He gets just a little happier.  I get happier.  I talk a lot more.  I'm more open. 
[00:17:30]  You talk a bit more  but you really have to study Anthony  to notice that you're drunk.  I don't really slur.  I can walk fine.  I've gotten out of  a lot of trouble.  You drive perfectly  when you're completely hammered.  I was one of the best  drunk drivers out there.  I defy anybody  to drive drunk  as well as I did.  I'd adhere to the speed limit  because I knew  there'd be a problem  if I got pulled over.  You know,  sit there,  keep it right between the lines.  I've been pulled over,  hammered before  and turned  and this was before 
[00:18:00]  I did radio  and just turned  and talked to the cop  and usually either  got a ticket  or got out of it  and just drove back  and believe me,  well over the legal limit.  One time I had  a restricted license.  I think it was  4th of July weekend.  I had, you know,  done what I usually do,  not inspect my vehicle.  It went too long,  got pulled over,  got a ticket for uninspected,  let that go  until there was,  you know,  some kind of warrant  out for me  so I had to  have a restricted license  for about 3 months. 
[00:18:30]  I went to the court,  got a restricted  work only license.  It's, I believe,  1,  1.30 in the morning  on 4th of July weekend  and I'm driving home  hammered  and I get pulled over  because one of my  headlights are out  and I give the cop,  now I'm drunk,  I'm giving him  a restricted license  that says work only,  it's the weekend,  it's 4th of July  and I'm convincing him  I'm out on a service call  because somebody's  air conditioner went out  and he bought it, 
[00:19:00]  gave me back  my big piece of  you shouldn't be  driving paper  and I went home.  But, yeah,  I stopped doing that.  Stopped doing that  years ago.  But I always thought  I was a very good  drunk driver.  I was one of those  that would make sure,  you know,  when I read about people  that get going  the wrong way  on the expressway  and they're plowing  into people,  it's like,  how do you do that?  I am the safest  when I'm drunk.  And how drunk  do you have to be  where you don't notice  you're going  the wrong way  on a highway?  The wrong way  on the highway. 
[00:19:30]  Just getting on it  is a pain in the ass.  Yeah, how do you  even get on it?  Have you ever gotten on  having to make  a U-turn?  And then you do  get on it.  How hammered are you  that you don't notice  cars come in  flying right after you?  Look at all these asses.  Wouldn't you immediately  pull over going,  oh, I really screwed up.  But I guess people  black out or something?  I don't get it.  Yeah, if you're a blackout  it can happen.  Alright, listen,  we gotta take a break  because we got so much  to do today.  We gotta get into  the McGreevy thing.  We also gotta get into  another smear campaign 
[00:20:00]  that's going on in Jersey.  Jersey's got some  of the best elections.  It's amazing.  They hate each other.  And then the Da Vinci Code  is causing controversy.  Freaking Barry Bonds  tied Ruth over the weekend.  Anyone see the horse race?  The Preakness?  Ouch.  With, uh,  what was the horse's name?  Barbaro?  Dog food.  Huh?  Yeah.  I'm amazed they haven't  killed the horse yet.  They probably will.  But it looks like, uh,  they're gonna attempt to,  you know,  save the thing.  They operate on, uh,  the horse.  Not gonna race him anymore.  I'm gonna put him out to stud.  Ah, dude. 
[00:20:30]  I don't know what they're doing.  They're just trying to,  they're just trying to keep  that horse alive  so they can get the stud fees.  Yeah, that's it.  To get as much sperm  as humanly possible  out of this thing  before they realize  they gotta kill it.  Why do they shoot it before,  why can't they just  fix his foot?  Well, a lot of times  you can't fix a horse's foot.  Why?  Because it's, uh,  the thoroughbred  racing against the thoroughbred  is never gonna win  with a bum leg.  Oh, no, no, no.  But he's saying  why can't you just  save the horse?  Oh, they do.  They do if you can 
[00:21:00]  put it out to stud like that.  Sometimes they're not stallions.  Yeah, this horse will  never race again,  but they're trying to  save it for the stud fees.  Sometimes racehorses  are geldings or mares.  They're not, um,  they're not made for,  you know,  they don't have  their, uh, sack left.  Well, you don't have  to kill it, though.  It's like you just  put a splint on it.  So a guy is then  gonna run his racehorse farm  and invite children over  to pet his little nose  as he pays to take care  of this horse? 
[00:21:30]  You shoot him.  Nah, you don't shoot him.  You shoot him.  You should shoot the elderly.  No, they're only...  Condone that.  They only kill the horse  because, uh,  because it's suffering.  It's suffering.  You gotta hurt it.  That horse earned its keep.  It's like paying  into Social Security.  That horse made this...  It earned its keep.  He made all his...  He made this guy  all his money.  He got nothing for it  but a nice brush.  Maybe a...  What did the horse  get out of it?  A big brush?  Some oats.  Faggity oats  and some flowers  thrown around it?  Well, maybe we'll...  You kill it. 
[00:22:00]  Alright, goodbye.  After the break,  maybe we'll get  the answer to that,  but I think it has  something to do  with the weight  of the horse, right?  It makes it very hard  for a leg to heal.  Yeah, a horse can't heal  like that properly.  A horse looks silly  in a hospital bed  with his hind legs up.  Can't get...  How many visitors  can they have in there, too?  Bunch of horse heads.  They don't know  how to use the remote.  I can't press it  with a horse.  A horse.  A horse.  Jeez.  He's still hung over.  He's still hung over.  It's a German coming out.  The horse.  The horse.  But none of you guys 
[00:22:30]  saw the race live?  The Preakness?  That was unbelievable  because he was the favorite  by far.  They were saying  possible triple crown.  Big A was talking  about it when he was in.  He must have bet on it,  the mush.  Probably, yeah,  he said he was going  to the Preakness.  Oh, that's right.  He did say he was  going to the Preakness.  I'm betting it all  on this horse.  Crack.  He probably stepped  on its foot backstage.  Backstage.  Whatever they call it.  Yeah, that big,  fat, big A foot  in the stalls.  Yeah.  The paddock area.  Went to paddock.  The horse panicked.  Preakness,  like, oops. 
[00:23:00]  The animal can just  sense that he's like,  he's kind of a murderer  and an ass  and backed up.  So, all right,  we got lots to do.  We'll take a break  and we'll kind of  continue here.  So stay there.  It's the ONA virus  spreading across America.  It'll be an Anthony show.  They'll rock you  till you puke.  Puke?  Like, throw up?  Why would I want to do that?  Do it like this.  Do it like this.  Yeah, you're checking out  the O.B. and Anthony show.  The phone number,  1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:23:30]  1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to  Tony the trucker.  Tony, what's going on today, man?  Hey, good morning, guys.  How y'all doing?  Pretty good, Tony.  Hi, Tony.  Hey, I just wondered  if y'all was going to talk  about your appearance  on Hannity and Combs at all.  Maybe play some clips or something.  I didn't get to check it out Friday.  Oh, it was cool.  It was an all right appearance.  It was like a fluff piece, really.  There was nothing really crazy going on.  Just a couple of pals  hanging out,  shooting the breeze.  Yeah, Hannity and Combs, 
[00:24:00]  well, Sean Hannity,  we know he supports this program.  He's been on this show many times.  He had us on,  and we're just kind of  hanging with the guy.  I don't think anything crazy  was really said.  Nah, it wasn't one of those.  I didn't figure on anything like that.  I was just wondering  if y'all was going to get  to touch on it a little bit.  Yeah, we got the audio  of our appearance.  Maybe we'll get into it  a little later today.  All right, guys.  Have a good show, man.  All right.  And you can download it  off our website.  All right, dude.  Yeah, it was cool.  They were nice to hang out with 
[00:24:30]  for a few minutes.  It wasn't like a, you know,  scandal piece.  I'm like,  we were sitting there sweating.  Oh, that was kind of nice stuff.  I got a little heat  from people on message boards  because they said  it was like I was  neglecting XM.  But we'd already done,  we had been on Hannity  when we got hired  over on XM Satellite Radio  and discussed that.  This was about us being hired 
[00:25:00]  by CBS.  So we discussed that.  And somebody kind of  twisted around that.  I said at the time  that we got hired by XM,  would we rather have done FM?  And at that time  when we were looking for work  before we got hired by XM  and for that whole time  we were off,  of course,  it was what we knew.  And I wanted to go back  to the same success we had,  all the affiliates we had,  you know,  the fans we had on FM. 
[00:25:30]  And that's what I wanted to do.  So I said at the time,  yeah,  I would have rather  have gone to a terrestrial radio.  But now,  this is the part I didn't say,  but now we have  the best of both worlds.  I love the way it is.  Love working over there at XM.  Love working here at CBS.  It's great.  We're the only people doing it.  But the message boards,  dude,  did you get the impression  that Anthony was kind of like  shirking off XM  and didn't want to be there anymore?  I'm predicting 
[00:26:00]  that in another year  they won't even be on XM  and they'll be on  terrestrial radio full time  and shut up.  God,  the speculation people get.  I had a post.  I said,  at the time  I said that.  You can't say anything  without some of these mutants  speculating  as to what you meant.  I know what I meant.  What people don't get  is that,  you know,  we walk over to XL,  XM,  and  what is it?  They don't understand,  though,  that we,  one of the frustrating things 
[00:26:30]  about terrestrial radio  is a lot of times  you couldn't say what you want.  I don't feel that anymore at all  because of XM.  It's like,  I love doing satellite and this.  I would never want to just do one.  I wouldn't want to go back  to only doing terrestrial  and never satellite.  It's great to be able  to do what you want  in both places.  Yeah.  There was a guy on hold.  Nothing, by the way.  There was a guy on hold  from Boston said,  well,  I gave your CBS show a try.  I don't like it.  Bye.  All right.  Goodbye.  Get a pulse.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Go find something else  to listen to.  Exactly.  We don't need you. 
[00:27:00]  Put on your iPod  so you can't hear horns  beeping at you.  Goodbye.  And I hope that you don't  hear that truck coming  while you're tapping  your feet to Iran,  stupid.  Especially after last week.  Last week,  we had a great,  great week of radio  over here  and over there.  It was just a really  good week of radio overall.  And this guy decides  Monday morning  that he doesn't like,  he's giving it a chance  and he doesn't like it.  Gave it a chance.  And I say goodbye.  Go listen to the Hillman.  Good riddance.  Go listen to the Hillman.  Man, that's got to be  some great radio  up there in Boston.  Woo!  What did he think? 
[00:27:30]  What did he think?  Like,  if we were just doing  our satellite show,  we would have gone over there  and told the same story  about being drunk  and drinking  and hungover.  What's the matter?  Not enough F words  in it for you?  Is that what it was?  We didn't say poopy?  What did he want?  It's the same story.  To a replay of us  looking out the window  and that whole segment  they played,  I really laughed  listening to it.  Yeah.  It was really funny.  Yeah, we're doing just fine.  But Mike's decided, 
[00:28:00]  ah, I gave it a chance.  I don't like it.  Gave it a chance.  Good.  Then go fuck yourself.  Oh, oh, hey now.  I, oof.  Oh, I was reaching  for the button I missed.  Yeah, I said that.  Yeah, I did.  I don't know why  I had to chime in  and offer nothing  about XM and Terrestrial.  What would we just like to do?  We want to do it both.  Hey, do both things there.  My mouth just opened up  and sounds came out of it.  Not one ounce  of real contribution there.  Just dreck.  Does Al on the dump button  ever go to the bathroom?  Is there one day 
[00:28:30]  where it's just not,  he's not going to be there?  He has a cup by him.  A cup.  Al's got to do his job.  Al, you stay right there.  It's part of Al's job  that they catalyze him  for the whole...  Al's on vacation?  Is he?  Who's running the board?  Oh my God, I'm in a panic.  Who's dumping?  I think Star is.  Yes.  Wait, now I'm in a panic.  It's all hard.  Now I'm in a panic.  Who's over there?  Someone, what's his name?  Zach?  Zach.  Oh God, Zach.  I hope you were paying attention.  I hope he got that one.  He didn't get it.  He didn't get it? 
[00:29:00]  Great, he didn't get it.  You're kidding, right?  Now we're screwed.  You idiot.  All right, here's...  I actually believe that.  Here's the horse update.  Good actor.  We were talking about this  before the break.  Listen in.  All right, horse racing update now.  After a bad break at the Preakness, Barbaro emerged from seven hours of surgery yesterday  and according to his doctor, Dr. Dean Richardson, who performed the procedure, quote, practically  jogged him back to his stall.  Dr. Richardson went on to say that he's never worked on so many catastrophic injuries to  one horse.  The procedure took place at the University of Pennsylvania's new Bolton Center for Large 
[00:29:30]  Animals.  The coach sustained life-threatening injuries after breaking three bones above and below  his right and rear ankle at the start of the Preakness.  Horses are often euthanized after serious leg injuries because of circulatory problems  and deadly disease that can occur if they are unable to distribute weight on all fours.  But as of yesterday, Barbaro was able to stand, albeit with the help of a harness.  Yeah, now that explained it right there.  Right.  That's what we were looking for, the explanation.  We got it.  I like that.  The hospital for big animals, big dumb animals. 
[00:30:00]  Hi, how are you?  The lady Di is recouping.  Proportional.  I saw the video of them when they were just petting him because he was kicking his gimp  leg.  Oh.  He was not happy.  That is sad.  It was beyond sad, man, because the jockey had to pull up really, really, really, really  hard to try to get the horse to stop because he was in race mode.  Because he knew there was something wrong right out of the gate.  I had a horse die on me on the backstretch.  The first time I ever went to Belmont here in New York to bet on the horses, I went there 
[00:30:30]  and bet on a horse, and in the backstretch, it just fell down and just died.  I looked at my ticket.  I just, do you get a refund or something?  And some guy's like, no, that's it.  You paid for it.  He goes, but ain't it worth two bucks to see a horse drop dead?  It really just dropped dead?  Dropped dead.  Heart attack?  Heart exploded in the backstretch.  It was over Johnny.  It was just some old horse?  Dunski.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:31:00]  It wasn't an old horse.  It's, you know, they just have conditions.  Yeah.  Some of them.  I never went to a horse race.  No?  It's a lot of fun, actually.  It's pretty exciting.  It's a good time.  Yeah.  You stand right by the finish line when they all come charging past.  Sounds like a stampede, because it is.  It just looks frightening for the little jockeys.  All those horses all caught.  I went horseback riding in camp when I was a boy.  I had to.  My mother forced me into camp.  She thought it would be a good experience for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't.  I hated camp. 
[00:31:30]  Did you enjoy the horseback riding?  It scared me, because my horse's name was Jim, too.  It was G-Y-M.  Oh, like gymnasium.  Yeah, but it was really kind of an uppity horse.  Oh.  Kind of liked me a little bit.  Yeah.  That's my whole story about camp.  But did he almost, like, throw you off?  Why were you scared of him?  Yeah, he was just kind of, like, bucking a lot and unpredictable, and I'm just such a...  He was probably just walking.  Some people get scared at the way a horse walks, because it's moving, and you assume it should  be like a bicycle. 
[00:32:00]  No, but the, who now I think is a lesbian camp counselor, told me, oh, she goes, well,  he's kind of unpredictable, that one.  He's, like, a little wild.  They like scaring the children like that at first.  Why not?  It worked.  All right.  Why don't we move on to the story of the day?  Jim, good old Jim McGreevy.  Jim McGreevy, former governor of...  New Jersey.  Fine Garden State of New Jersey.  And you might remember he came out before his, as he was retiring or giving up the job.  What do you call that?  Quitting?  Resigning.  Being forced out.  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Forced out of his job and the closet.  He, yeah, resigned and told everybody the reason was that he didn't want scandal in the office  of the governor.  And he had had some, he was a gay American.  And talk about some skeletons in that closet.  Like an African American, he called himself a gay American?  Yeah.  That's getting a little out of hand now.  I am a gay American and...  That whole blank American is getting out of hand now.  Stop with the hyphen.  Right. 
[00:33:00]  So you're like hogs in every country.  The gentleman came up from under the podium.  He went, yes, he is.  And, uh, well, that, uh, he, he wrote a book.  Right.  Here's the story.  And then we got to get, uh, it's much better in the papers than the, how the news is reporting  it.  Cause the playboy thing is hilarious.  Yeah.  We'll get into that in a second, but listen to this.  Well, if you thought Jim McGreevy's announcement that he was a gay American was shocking, wait  until you hear from his new tell all book.  16 pages of the book titled The Confession are out now. 
[00:33:30]  His book is going to be coming out in the fall.  In the book, the former New Jersey governor writes about his life as a gay man in power.  He also talks about meeting anonymous men at rest stops for sexual trysts.  McGreevy says the book is painfully honest.  Oh, I love you.  Johnny cakes.  I love you.  Johnny cakes.  He's a fag at rest stops.  So rest stops and bookstores or something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  It said rest stops.  Now, anybody who's, uh, listened to this program knows that, that the arrest stops seem  to be the place that, uh, gay guys that aren't hooked up and what can't afford a bar, a gay  bar.  I don't know what, what are the rest stops used for?  That seems to be the lowest common denominator of gay gentlemen and where to find them at  a rest stop.  You pull up used to, used to, when I was working for a living, when I was working Joe for, uh,  Apollo air conditioning, I'd have to pull into this rest stop at exit 52, uh, and pick up 
[00:34:30]  my partner, your cohorts, my cohort, my helper who would park his car there.  And, uh, a lot of times the helpers, you know, they, they, they're late.  So you pull in there and I'm reading the paper, got the radio on and, uh, yeah, people walk  up and Hey, how you doing?  I'm like, it's cold out here.  Are you the new helper?  I could be.  No, I guess you're not.  It's yet. 
[00:35:00]  Help a buddy out.  Well, yeah.  And, and, and you, you look around and there's a bunch of people, uh, guys with the right  around the perimeter of the rest stop, never in the middle.  It's usually around by the wooded area.  And there are two guys in there and they're chatting or another guy is, uh, uh, got his  parking lights on and, uh, the windows rolled down.  These rest stops just turned into these places.  I mean, I'm sure it was a great idea.  I propose we put a place on the sides of these great highways of ours where people can stop 
[00:35:30]  and maybe take a break.  If they have been driving too long, or perhaps they must meet somebody, uh, that they are  driving with the carpooling will help save petroleum in our great country.  And you can relieve yourself too.  Or perhaps faggots need to meet.  Where did it, where did it happen?  Where did it turn?  That's such a great idea.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  Turned to smudge.  I'll tell you what it is.  It's the urinal. 
[00:36:00]  The urinal is, is the dangling light at three in the morning for the moths in the gay community.  And where did it-  Flutter around it.  And where did it turn-  Poetic way to put that, Jimmy.  When it, where did it turn when the first horse and buggy needed to take a little break.  Right.  I bet you it turned right away.  Uh, uh, how are you?  You, uh, need a little help there, partner?  Well, they just started admiring each other's horses. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Now I see why they say that about horses.  Thanks.  So, McGreevy went to the rest stops, but, um, rest stops, by the way, they're not for  probably the really hardcore gay community.  No?  I think they're for like the married guys.  Oh, the guys that are just trying to keep it on the DL?  Yeah.  Rest stops are like, they're like the fat chick of the straight community.  But, but if you're, you're the governor of the state of New Jersey, you've probably  been on the news. 
[00:37:00]  I'll bet you see-  You're kind of in the public eye just a little bit.  You go in there, you see the workers closing up a hole.  You're like, that won't be necessary.  You see JFK when they show the guy in the hospital operating.  He goes, no, that's, that won't be necessary.  But there's a hole in his back.  That won't be necessary.  That won't be necessary.  That's what this is.  You're closing up.  Some guys, yeah, got the, uh, spackle and some stuff.  He's going to close up a hole between two of the stalls.  And, uh, excuse me, uh, I'm the governor here in this state.  Um, I actually am the guy that comes up with this work. 
[00:37:30]  You can leave.  Take that spackle outside.  It's bad fumes for the people.  And as a matter of fact, could you get a hole saw with about a four inch diameter  and bring it in here and knock a few more through the other walls?  I'm six foot two.  I have to squat to get through that hole.  It's a safety hazard.  Sandpaper.  We can't have splinters.  I'm here to take a safety break.  Splinters.  What are they in the OK Corral cruising each other?  What am I thinking?  Look how long it's been.  I get this sawdust off the floor. 
[00:38:00]  So, uh, he was doing the gay sex at the Garden State Highway rest stops.  Yeah, at the rest stops, which is odd if you're the governor of a state, especially New Jersey.  You're probably known.  Uh, but he, he had such a, I guess this, this fear of, of being known as a gay guy that he couldn't hit the bars.  Um, and from his book, from the excerpts, it said he wanted some kind of relationship, you know, some kind of things like him and maybe Johnny Cakes, maybe a, a biker fireman, uh, up in the, uh, Northeast. 
[00:38:30]  Maybe that's the kind of thing he wanted, but he couldn't, he couldn't do that because he's married and he's the governor.  So, he would just go cruising the rest stops and then, the story says, he would also go to bookstores.  Yeah, somebody explain this.  Could somebody explain what?  In Barnes & Noble, behind the chess books.  Is that what it is?  It's the hang.  Right between the chess books and self-help weight loss.  You have no idea what goes on there. 
[00:39:00]  Nothing but hogs and smiles.  You think he's right?  I'm just thinking that, that perhaps there's, uh, a, a protocol in the bookstore where you walk up and go, what are you reading?  Suck the.  No, it's in the porn bookstores.  Believe me.  Again, I realize I'm a, I'm a mope in real life, but I walk into the bookstore.  You'd think it was JLo.  Oh, they're all like a bunch of, just a bunch of, they're every stereotypical creep. 
[00:39:30]  But the adult book.  And regular, no.  Oh, you see, okay.  Not regular books.  No, that's what.  Regular books.  So, you're talking, it's gotta be like porno.  Adult books.  Adult.  Porn shops.  No, because Ann and I were talking about this before the show.  It's not a bookstore.  Like, regular bookstores, is this going on?  And it's gotta be the adult bookstores.  A porn shop is a porn shop where you mean they're selling like marital aids.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And gizmos and stuff.  And movies.  But one, then why wouldn't they say that?  Why would they say bookstore?  We just don't call it the adult boutique in bookstores.  But I remember in one place, I used to, like, I'd come home from spots a lot of times.  I used to try to go and, you know, the booths are private. 
[00:40:00]  But the little, I remember one time, notes were flying over at me.  Oh, Jesus.  It was amazing.  They just couldn't.  I was so luscious.  So luscious.  They had, they lusted me so bad with my alabaster skin and my sweet boyish smile.  You were just a prize.  Notes were flying over at me.  What did they say?  They were crawling for me.  I don't know.  I didn't read them.  I just saw paper fluttering over.  I was like, ugh.  It's kind of creepy.  Lovely.  I used to go to, this is before the internet, when I was, like, in junior high and stuff. 
[00:40:30]  I used to go to bookstores and go to the photography section and go through the books because a lot of times.  Check out the nudes.  There'd be nudes, yeah.  Right.  There'd be, like, nudes.  Photographed in nudes.  And I would just, like, sit in there and look.  But then somebody would come by.  There's always some busy body that actually wanted to learn about cameras.  And I have to shut the book.  I could find smut in any bookstore.  I'd look around.  What section? 
[00:41:00]  Cooking?  No.  There's nothing ever in there.  Painting?  Sometimes you'd just have to look at nude paintings.  Wherever you could get it back then.  It's very rough without computers.  By the way, I'm distracted because Bert and Philly, Garden State Parkway, not Garden State Highway, Opie.  Oh.  He'd have anonymous gay sex at Garden State Highway rest stops.  Yeah, Garden State Parkway or Highway rest stops.  What's the difference?  So all over New Jersey.  Relax, Bert.  All, you know, rest stops all over New Jersey.  Garden State.  They were calling Jersey the Garden State. 
[00:41:30]  They weren't saying Garden State Parkway.  Right.  Mister.  And that's not exactly the point of the story.  It's just like these people.  Yeah, right?  Stop listening to every fucking word.  Oh, easy now.  Every word.  All right.  Just sit back and listen to the damn show.  Dump guy, listen to every word.  The dump guy, listen to every word.  It gets frustrating, though.  We just shut up and enjoy the show.  Yeah.  If we screw up a word, we screw up a word.  We'll point it out.  It's getting really annoying at this point. 
[00:42:00]  I love you, urinal cakes.  Anyway.  Stephen from Bayshore.  That was a good episode last night.  Oh, yeah.  So the story gets better.  So it's the rest stops.  It's the bookstores.  Yeah.  And then he was, because he knew he was in the public eye and stuff, and his career was  on the line.  He was trying to make himself straight or something like that?  Yeah.  He always was trying to make himself straight or do something because he had this gay streak  in him.  But, of course, he was married and wanted to continue being governor, but it just took 
[00:42:30]  him over.  So he tried his best, and through prayer, he tried prayer, praying to God, which, I'd love  to know how that prayer goes.  I don't know.  I know a couple of the popular prayers.  I don't know that one.  Yeah.  Might have to do that later.  Might have to go through some aggrieved prayers after nine.  Because you're kneeling by the bed praying, and you're like, well, I'm already in this  position. 
[00:43:00]  God, gee, it's so hard.  It's like memory-sense association.  It's like, I don't want to have gay thoughts anymore, so let me pray while bending over  and grabbing my ankles.  Let me pray with my face in the pillow and whiskey being breathed to the side of my face  when I'm seven.  And then there was this thing that he did where he would just stare at Playboy Center  Folds, I guess hoping for something.  Can you picture him just looking at it just like, nah. 
[00:43:30]  The same way any one of us would look at a bag of mulch.  Yeah, just nothing.  Nothing.  This is doing nothing for me.  He said, well, his wife actually said she got tipped off because she peeked in, and he  had a Playboy open, and he was just going, ugh, ugh, yuck, bleh, bleh, bleh.  Dry heaving.  So he would just stare at naked girls in Playboy, hoping he would get some kind of reaction.  Yeah, yeah, he would try to, I guess, train himself to enjoy looking at nude women. 
[00:44:00]  But Playboy, you're not going to get turned on looking at Playboy.  It's fluff.  If you want to get Hustler or something that's hardcore, that you can probably get some of  us just, we'll get, you know, turned on by Playboy.  Playboy was great growing up.  What is wrong with Playboy?  It's too, like, I like to do everything.  I understand it's too polished and, you know.  Yeah, it's not what I like.  I don't like a lot of airbrushing.  You don't get turned on by Playboy, though?  You need something much more hardcore?  I want to see more of the woman.  Her legs are never open in Playboy.  They're always like, she's always like, it's always some coy, it's too perfect, and that doesn't 
[00:44:30]  really turn me on.  I don't mind the perfectness.  I don't like the airbrushing.  There's too much of it there.  They don't even look real.  It looks like a painting sometimes.  But I kind of like the just nude.  And I mean, like, completely.  Don't put on, like, garters or a little, like, skirt thing or sock.  I like naked.  You're meat and potatoes.  That's your basic, that's your thing.  How do you not like garters and skirts with the little hiney sticking out?  No, no.  As far as I'm concerned, especially growing up and thumbing through Playboy or something 
[00:45:00]  like that, the best pictures were when they had absolutely nothing on.  Don't put on heels.  Don't put on anything.  Dude, there's a girl I know.  I'm almost salivating right now as I'm remembering this girl.  Almost.  She was, uh, she has an amazing hiney, and she would wear a short skirt for me.  And, um, I don't know, you know. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, oh, patting down the head.  A short skirt.  No, say what you're going to say.  Not that it was just, I appreciate the quality, but it was just, you could have put over.  A little distracting.  Did we do a radio show?  As, as you're talking.  See, I understand.  If someone else is telling a story, it's okay to kind of plop something in front of you.  And someone's going to say, I'm bitching again, but I saw it in Jimmy's eyes.  It's like, like, people see what we do, and they think it's, it is so easy, they can just  distract us.  But we're trying to focus on, uh, I'm trying to focus on Anthony and what Jimmy's saying, 
[00:46:00]  and, and then we're, we all do the same thing.  And then someone just casually comes in, you heard it in the background, and lays Jimmy's  food right in front of him.  Right in front of him.  And you're, it's so easy when you're telling a story in the air to be distracted.  And the second you get distracted, you, you kind of lose your fluid sense of the story.  This looks, you know, so easy, but it's not.  We're actually sitting here concentrating our asses off.  And I do appreciate the guy goes out and gets my food, my call, which, you know, look,  we bust their, their balls, but we do appreciate when they, they do it, but it's like, well, 
[00:46:30]  I don't either.  I had to say that to set this up.  Um, but it's like, Sean, he's, he's a good egg, um, who I hope dies after this experience.  And he did get me good fruit, by the way.  But like, I was interested in the middle of it, and I hear this.  And you can't see it, but the way I'm sitting, I'm kind of on an angle.  Anthony is directly straight to my left.  Ope's kind of directly straight to my right.  It's a triangle.  Like it should be with three men.  Three men, cracker in the middle.  And, uh, yeah, exactly.  Last one done eats it.  And remember I put on my saltine shirt and I lay back with my mouth open. 
[00:47:00]  Go ahead, boys.  Let's, let's get this contest a rolling.  And I, I hear this.  So I, she puts on this really short.  I don't even remember what you were saying.  That's what, that's what's bothering me.  I don't even remember what you were talking about.  I was, I didn't understand.  Because I watched him come from the door.  I'm like, he's not going to just casually walk in the middle of the triangle and then plop  food down.  Yeah, he did.  Because Anthony doesn't like short skirts, like skirts and garters, like you prefer nudity. 
[00:47:30]  Totally nude.  And as you said that, I remembered a girl who would wear this little plaid skirt for  me and she had like a big ass.  Like I like a big ass.  Um, not fat and gross, but I mean muscle, like just feminine.  And I was thinking of how she looked in this short skirt where like the bottom of her cheeks  would hang out.  And I don't know if I've ever seen anything as sexy as that.  Really?  She bends forward and that, like the, the place where the back of the thigh meets the  body, that ass from just half of that is sticking out where there's nothing sexier. 
[00:48:00]  So you're not into, you're just totally nude?  In magazines, I'm saying.  A little clothes.  A little clothes could really get the job done.  The right ones are great.  Those, uh, what do they call them?  Clothes.  The little frilly boy shorts.  How about, how about saying a little lingerie?  A little clothes could get the job done.  Lingerie.  I like when she wears the sports socks all the way up to her.  A little clothes.  Oh man.  Clothes.  Way to take the sexiness out of it.  Clothing.  Nice.  One of my t-shirts.  A little clothes could go a long way.  You're in those slacks and that button down shirt and tie.  I'm talking about maybe just having the panties on or the bra. 
[00:48:30]  I have to say clothes.  Like, ugh.  Boy shorts are the sexiest.  Boy shorts are very sexy on the little, the girls when they have their, uh, like you said,  the bottom half of the butt and it's kind of like frilly around there.  Like a little lace.  I prefer no lace.  No lace?  Yeah, I don't hate lace.  It doesn't suck.  But I prefer no lace.  I prefer just simple, here's what I like.  If you can get like boy shorts that are like a white, I prefer, always prefer a white lingerie 
[00:49:00]  because it shows more.  More detail through.  Right, right.  Uh, you gotta be shaved and I gotta see like a nice short, uh, white or transparent boy shorts.  And, uh, I want them to be just bulging and packed.  Like, uh.  Like there's a fist in your boy shorts.  Nice fist.  Like a sideways chimp mouth.  Yeah.  Like an 1890s catcher's mitt.  That's right. 
[00:49:30]  I was in Central Park over the weekend and they have a vintage baseball league.  I guess this is kind of taking off.  Ugh.  And I was, uh, I was, uh, in line skating, you know, with, uh, Lindsay and we stopped  and they're playing, they're playing baseball but they're following the 1894 rules.  Do black people try to get in and they beat them with the bats?  Yeah.  There were no blacks.  No blacks allowed.  No blacks allowed.  But I guess this, uh, this, this vintage baseball league thing is taking off all over  New York State and they travel and they play each other. 
[00:50:00]  And some teams, they follow the 1894 rules and other teams, uh, follow the 1885 rules.  You've got to be kidding me.  And the rules are completely different so they have to have a coin toss to decide if  they're going to play by the 1894 rules or the 1880 rules.  And they dress and use the same equipment from way back when?  It's kind of like the Renaissance festivals and all that because now the women on the  sidelines, they're dressed how you should dress back in the day with their little umbrellas  like they, like they were really going to a game in 1894.  Isn't that racist not to have black people though in it? 
[00:50:30]  Like if they want to play?  Oh, there was a black.  It was like, was there?  Okay.  All right.  Everyone, it's got to be political.  It kind of ruins the reality of it, but you know, you got to be all inclusive.  Why don't you really have a vintage baseball?  I've seen civil war reenactments where there's black people on the Confederate side.  Have you?  Yeah.  But anyway.  And I know people say, there were black people on the Confederate side.  It's like, yeah, but you know, you don't want them in the reenactments like that.  But we're watching the vintage baseball league and the only guy that had a mitt was the catcher. 
[00:51:00]  And this thing was so retarded looking.  I'm like, it took that long to figure out that you could put some kind of webbing in  it so you could actually catch the ball.  How stupid were we?  Was it illegal?  100 years ago, 100 plus years ago.  Someone tried to sew one in and they went, uh-uh-uh.  This mitt was obviously something they used back in the 1890s.  It was just big and there was no actual webbing.  It was just two big pads and nowhere to really catch the ball.  I guess the theory was that you would just stop the ball in front of you. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  But how dumb were we that we couldn't figure out that we could actually catch it?  Working on other things.  Like Howard Flight.  And then the rest of the players were playing without mitts.  It was a whole baseball game without mitts.  Why would they do that?  Like, why?  Just play.  Play some softball, you fags.  All right.  With the 1800s.  1850.  Yeah.  Would they?  And the baseball bats that just looked really just ridiculous.  Like it was an actual tree trunk, basically. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Just moved down a little bit.  No real shape to it.  They just do that so they have something to talk about.  What'd you do?  I played 1884 baseball.  Please, if you're friends with one of these douches, when they mention the year that they  played by the rules, don't ask what's the difference.  Just go, okay.  And then watch how they try to get back into the conversation.  They will be so angry.  We don't play by the rules of today.  Oh, yeah.  It's cool.  And then just ignore them and watch them find a way to get in their stupid weekend experience.  It's just something to do on the weekends. 
[00:52:30]  We're all looking for something to do on the weekends.  I'm not.  So.  All right.  We should take a break, huh?  Righto.  What is E-Rock laughing at?  What are you laughing at?  Oh, me.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  What are you laughing at?  Oh, thank you.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-FREE.  That's 866-313-FREE.  The phone lines are going berserk.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:53:00]  Weekday mornings.  Opie and Anthony.  Except 202.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out this morning.  I do.  We greatly appreciate that.  What's up, West Palm?  You awake?  Ooh.  Are you awake?  One of our markets.  We're doing shout outs. 
[00:53:30]  It's all about West Palm today.  It is.  Why not?  103.1, the buzz in West Palm.  Checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Nice.  I bet you I surprised the hell out of them today.  With a little shout out.  Our own E-Rock is from there, as his family is.  E-Rock's family from West Palm Beach.  That's where they get to listen now.  Sure.  Hey, Baghdad.  Yeah.  9-1-1. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, my God.  You just turned me on to a new show because I need new shows now.  What's it called?  Baghdad ER?  What's it on?  HBO?  Yeah.  Oh.  God, this is rough.  This is rough to watch.  I don't know if it's a series or a one-off or what the hell it was, but it was disturbing.  And it was on, like, at 11 o'clock last night or something, so it was the last thing I watched.  I had to go to sleep and have old scary bed dreams.  Nighty-night, Anthony.  I know, because I was tired then and had to go to bed. 
[00:54:30]  But it shows a hospital in Baghdad, one of the hospitals that they take the wounded to  before they ship them to Germany to get better medical care.  They try to stabilize them there, and then they could send them off.  But, you know, some guys come in, never leave.  And some guys never leave with all their parts.  And it's just like a butcher shop.  They would show on the screen, improvised explosive, goes off next to a vehicle, 
[00:55:00]  which is 90% of everything that happens over there.  And they bring in, you know, the cop just come in, and it's set up like an ER, you know,  like you'd see around here.  Doctors are walking around.  They're joking with each other.  They look the part.  And then they're just handling carnage.  And it doesn't matter.  They'll take care of whoever comes in, the Americans, Iraqis, and insurgents. 
[00:55:30]  They treat them all.  And they had people coming in that were just meat.  It looked like meat at a butcher shop.  And you think back at the Civil War.  It's those old pictures, black and white pictures of the guy with the hacksaw.  And he's just sawing away at a leg because they can't save the leg.  No anesthesia.  Well, I guess the anesthesia has gotten better.  But the process is now motorized because they used what looked like a Sawzall. 
[00:56:00]  But chunks of beef are coming off of this guy.  And they're just putting it in this red biohazard bag, tying it up.  And, you know, then some ER room nurse would come in and mop up just gallons of blood on the floor.  And then there'd be other guys that have kind of superficial wounds, but they're so screwed up in the head.  Like they come in and they're asking, were you knocked unconscious?  Are you okay?  Do you feel?  And the guy's like, yeah, I think, guys. 
[00:56:30]  And he's just got like his eyes are looking 10,000 miles away.  And really creepy show to watch.  It's just another aspect of the war that really isn't seen that much.  And, again, it wasn't one of those, you know, war bad or war great.  This is what we're fighting for.  Or, oh, my God, get our guys out of there.  Although, as I'm watching, you're just thinking, do we really have to be there any longer?  Can we please, you know, get these guys out of there? 
[00:57:00]  Because they're just getting blown apart as they're driving down the road.  That's pretty much it.  If it wasn't for the improvised roadside bombs that are going off, it'd be a breeze.  But so many of these guys are getting killed like that.  Then some of the worst was, you know, two guys come in, got some pretty bad injuries.  And the third guy that was in the vehicle is dead.  And so now these two guys that are injured are trying to console each other that the guy that they just were with,  and one guy goes, every time I shut my eyes, I can't get the image out of my head. 
[00:57:30]  He goes, my friend had no face.  Just like his buddy there.  They're just driving.  And you've got to realize as you're watching this, they're being treated minutes after this happened.  So you're seeing guys' reactions to stuff mere 15 minutes maybe after the event actually happened.  So there's raw emotion with these guys.  And it's really hard to watch, hard to watch the show, but I would definitely recommend it. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, I've got to check that out.  When me and Colin were over there in 2003, we got to, we went into one of those ERs.  But it was at one of the Air Force bases or whatever.  But it was empty.  It was kind of luckily, there was nobody in it.  So we got to actually walk into the operating room, and they showed us the way it works.  This is like the triage or whatever, and this is where you bring them to do it.  It seems like unfortunately the insurgents are getting a little better at their jobs,  and a lot more people are getting injured by these things and killed.  So, you know, now, I mean, if these guys go a couple of hours without people coming in, they're happy. 
[00:58:30]  And they show them playing basketball and stuff.  And as the doctors that are off duty are playing basketball,  because their whole life revolves within about a quarter mile of the hospital.  That's the secured zone.  Yeah.  So they never leave.  One guy said, he goes, the thing I want to do the most is walk more than a quarter mile.  Because you don't leave.  You live there.  You work there.  You play there.  That's your whole area.  So they're playing basketball.  And the whole time they're playing, Red Cross Blackhawks are just, and he goes, you know, we're out here playing ball, 
[00:59:00]  but every one of these that we see coming in, we know what it is, you know.  It's just more guys coming in.  Unbelievable.  I mean, you hear about the death rate is up well above 2,500, I guess.  I'm not exactly sure.  But the injured is above 17,000 that have been injured.  And these are people that go from anything from, you know, a little shrapnel wound to losing limbs. 
[00:59:30]  And, you know, the rest of their life is going to be spent in wheelchairs.  What's just unbelievable.  What drives me nuts, it's barely reported in the papers.  Barely reported on TV.  Yeah, that's why.  When Britney Spears is on the cover of both papers because her baby ain't buckled in correctly,  I get pissed because there's a war going on.  And all we're getting is, I don't know.  Well, the Daily News today is a perfect example.  What do they got? 
[01:00:00]  Beach Train.  There's a B line here in New York City, obviously, right?  Yeah.  Subway, one of the subway lines.  And so they have the B, and the headline is Beast Train.  And the paper says today, T.A. plan.  If there's a hurricane evacuation, you could take your pets on the trains and buses.  Could you stop it with the New York hurricane contingency plans?  It's not going to be.  Long Island, there's a problem. 
[01:00:30]  I know people that live south shore of Long Island that when it rains hard, their houses flood.  So if there's a hurricane, there's a problem.  These rich idiots that build these houses out on the Hamptons because we haven't had a major, major hurricane out there for quite a while.  Good.  Have fun.  I hope your billion-dollar insurance policies are paid up because those houses, gone.  New York City, stop it.  You're fine.  You are fine in New York City.  We're not going to get a major hurricane in New York City any time now. 
[01:01:00]  It doesn't happen.  Like I said, if the hurricane's moving...  It would have to be the perfect storm and the odds of that.  First of all, the water's got to be warmer.  Our water never gets that warm.  Right.  If it's moving fast enough where it's not losing strength, it's moving by us too quickly.  If it's moving slow, it gets so weakened by the colder water.  And New York City itself is pretty hurricane-proof.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Jesus Christ.  They want to scare you again. 
[01:01:30]  And who's going into the subways if there's going to be flooding?  That's the low ground.  That's the place you don't go.  That's the low ground.  And where are you going?  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  A bunch of dogs.  Where are you taking the subway to?  Do you think buildings are getting blown over by the wind?  Yeah.  When was the last time a skyscraper got blown over by a hurricane?  Like you're going to go in the subway and all the big buildings are going to be tipped over when you get out?  Yeah.  You and your dumb dog.  Yeah, thank God your little dog will be fine.  Let's forage for some food now, stupid animal.  You sit inside. 
[01:02:00]  You watch it on TV.  Hope your electricity doesn't go out.  That's what a hurricane's about in New York City.  Just stop already.  There you go.  But that's their top story.  And, you know, meanwhile, every day things are happening.  And, like, you watch that show, Baghdad ER, and you see, like, there was one guy, and it ended really bad.  Like, they – and I know they've got to do this to over-dramatize it.  It's a documentary, but they are really tugging at you. 
[01:02:30]  And it worked.  They had this big marine comes in.  He's got a small shrapnel wound to the chest, but it put a hole in one of his pulmonary arteries.  So they had to open them up and try to stop the bleeding.  So they get in there, stop the bleeding as best they can, and they're trying to stabilize them.  And they're just all sitting with them all night telling them, hang in there.  And you're watching the clock, and it's, like, 3 in the morning and 6 in the morning, and they're just telling them.  And finally the doctor just had to call it.  He goes, turn off the monitor. 
[01:03:00]  Turn off the respirator.  And they're, like, you know, he's such a big, young guy, and he was in such good shape.  And then you wonder, it's, like, because they didn't say the name, and you're, like, when did this happen?  Who is this guy?  When did he die?  How come we, you know, this is the first I'm hearing of it, you know?  You kind of want to know a little more about these people, but it's just – and they throw them in virtual wheelbarrows out of the ER.  They throw them in these things, in the body bags, wheel them to that morgue. 
[01:03:30]  The chaplain comes in, says a prayer.  They close the freezer again.  They're showing them with personal effects and things like that.  And it's just, like, no one – you know, everyone knows what's going on over there,  but there doesn't seem to be this caring about any of these guys that are dying and being maimed, you know?  Whether you – for the war or not, there just doesn't seem to be the recognition that these soldiers should be getting. 
[01:04:00]  It's kind of sad.  Yeah, they should be telling us what's going on there.  Yeah, who is it?  But then the support for the war would drop even more and –  Yeah, you know.  I don't know how much support there is for it anymore.  No, I understand that, but if they told us exactly what's going on and about all the people that are injured.  Not for what it is.  Like, people don't want to support – people want to support it, especially at the beginning,  when it was sold to us the way it was.  It sounded great, very noble, very American, in our best interest and everything. 
[01:04:30]  But just trying to justify so many guys, Americans, sacrificing themselves for – to give those –  what I equate to animals' freedom, that didn't have the courage to stand up themselves,  that wanted – that didn't want freedom enough to stand up and join together and overthrow their government,  like had been done in the past with many dictatorships.  It's happened.  It costs blood.  But you know whose blood gets spilled?  The blood of the people that want the freedom, the people that are being oppressed. 
[01:05:00]  That seems to be the best way that these are handled.  The way that people appreciate their freedom is through their own spilt blood.  We as Americans know it ourselves.  You really believe we're there for freedom?  That's what is being sold.  That was sold to us.  Well, no, the original thing sold was there's threats that there's weapons that are going to hurt us.  That's kind of like, all right, we've got to stop the guy.  When he went into Kuwait, that was a noble effort.  Kuwait is an ally. 
[01:05:30]  Saddam was going beyond his boundaries.  We stopped him, and that was that.  This one, we're kind of sold on the idea that the weapons were there.  We went in.  All right, they're not there.  But now this, they want freedom, even let's stabilize the area is kind of okay.  That's like, all right, you know, to have another country in there like an Israel that is democratic  and that, you know, sees things our way would kind of be nice.  But don't start with Iraq, for God's sake. 
[01:06:00]  I defended dumb Bush.  I did.  I defended him.  I was for it.  The only thing that bothered me even back then was some military guy, some retired military guy.  Said his problem with it.  He goes, look, I'm in the service, or I was in the service, but I didn't join up to invade a sovereign nation.  That's what kind of always bothered me about it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what a lot of people think, too.  I was for it.  I'm not going to lie.  Yeah, we all were really kind of for this when it started because it was one of those things where it's like, you know, 
[01:06:30]  hey, this guy, this scumbag, we've been watching him for years.  I mean, how long do we have to spend money on jet fuel to defend this no-fly zone we had for a good 10 years almost  that we were trying to keep his planes from taking off?  And then after a while, it's like the guy's not listening.  He's making weapons.  All right, let's go in.  And then you find out maybe the intel isn't good, didn't have the weapons.  All right, let's change the object of this whole thing.  They want to be a democratic society. 
[01:07:00]  No, they don't.  On the answer to feedback, Walter from Virginia.  George Stepanophilus reads everyone's name every Saturday, but you mock anyone who isn't a Fox News broadcaster.  We do not.  No, we don't.  What?  What?  CBS News shows do it, too.  Never, never does your beloved Fox do it.  No, I know Fox doesn't.  Fox, they're full of idiots.  We know that.  But so is CNN.  They all are.  There's not one news agency that doesn't have some type of agenda one way or the other. 
[01:07:30]  The only problem is everybody complains about it.  Fox's bias towards the conservative is very obvious.  Of course.  And the only problem I have is everybody complains about that, but they never complain about the liberal slant of CNN and the other major networks.  We know Fox is more conservative.  We admit that.  But nobody admits CNN by allowing that stupid ex over Cheney when he was talking.  Right.  Come on.  Stop.  Lon in Georgia.  Enough, Mother Sheehan.  The war was okay then, and it is now. 
[01:08:00]  Mother Sheehan, please.  I can't trash her.  Don't equate me with that lunatic.  That woman.  I don't.  You know something?  Okay.  I'll feel bad that her son died.  Period.  That's it.  It doesn't excuse her for being a total ass.  She's, uh, I don't know.  Look, I don't, I don't, I find her really irritating, but it's like, look, I don't know what that does to you when you, when you, like, I would probably be in a rage, too, if my son was shot over there and then I saw, like, Bush doing a video of, where's the weapons?  That would probably, that would anger you, of course. 
[01:08:30]  She's had enough, but I mean.  I hate her hairdo.  That's my big problem with her.  It's not helping the claws.  What's wrong with her hairdo?  Nothing, Opie.  All right.  Yeah, people say.  I'm going to point it out that she looks like Opie.  She looks exactly like her.  No, she doesn't.  She does.  She looks more like Don Imus.  No.  Give me a little bit of a break here.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We'll get back into some funny stuff, hopefully, in just a bit.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony, this ain't your mama's radio show.  Bitch. 
[01:09:00]  Do you understand that nobody likes you?  Opie and Anthony mornings.  Coming to the Opie and Anthony show in the near future.  Jimmy Day.  In the near future.  Do we have details on Jimmy Day for today?  Not a Sunday, is it?  Not yet.  What?  Tomorrow?  Hopefully tomorrow we'll have details on Jimmy Day.  Of course, talking about Jimmy Norton.  And you're playing the Stress Factory, Jim. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, I'm doing it for more of the weekend.  So I know a lot of the shows are selling, so you can come down.  732.  Of course.  545.  Ha ha.  There you go.  Jim Norton at the Stress Factory.  1-866-313-FREE is the phone number.  1-866-313-FREE.  I just bit my tongue eating an egg sandwich.  I'm dying.  Want me to kiss it?  That's all right.  Was it front or side?  Front or side bite? 
[01:10:00]  I bit the tongue and my lip.  Inside my bottom lip.  Did you ever get into a pattern of that?  Like there's something about your chewing.  There's certain areas in my mouth I would bite over and over.  I'm like, you've been eating for 37 years, fat face.  Why don't you learn how to do it properly?  There's a spot way back by your cheek in your rearmost molars, and if you bite that, it'll  swell up a little bit, and then you're constantly biting it.  It swells up for a year every time you bite it, because all of a sudden, eight months later,  there it is again.  Yeah, well, why didn't God give us a little leeway in our mouths? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, we have a couple of imperfections.  A little leeway would be nice.  It swells just slightly, and next thing you know, your teeth are gnawing at the inside  of your mouth in an area.  I think God should work on MS and Down syndrome.  Yeah, before biting your cheek.  I want perfect bite.  A couple of other things on the list that I think top it.  Yeah, God is still in the lab fixing a few things.  There's some perjuria kids walking around going, boy, I wish I could just bite my cheek,  and that was about it.  But no, I bite my cheek, I bite right through it. 
[01:11:00]  I will bite the inside of my lip now 10, 12 times in the next two weeks.  It'll just keep swelling, and it's just ridiculous.  All right.  But remember we were looking for newscasts?  Remember.  Where they're showboating, where they're improvising, where they're not improv, yeah.  Where they're doing everything but give us the news.  It's when they go off the teleprompter, or when they try to have a little conversation,  impromptu conversation with the weather guy or something. 
[01:11:30]  And it's just awkward, it doesn't work, because they're talking heads.  Because they're still disingenuous scumbags.  It's like, stop trying to showcase your personality when you're not really showcasing your personality.  Yeah, because you're petrified to.  Yeah, don't try to be the fun, you know, little segue.  Anyway, tell us about the weather then.  If you're going to be just a piece of stiff newsreading garbage, be that.  But if you want to try to show your personality, show your real personality. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  They're just a waste of space.  They're awful.  So we're looking for people all over America to send in examples of your local newscasts  where they're kind of improv-ing and doing something a little unusual.  Yeah.  Because it never goes well.  Coming off.  And we got the first one.  It's Jenny from WXIITV, I guess.  Channel 12 in North Carolina.  She wraps her traffic report.  What's happening?  She's wrapping.  Oh, no.  R-A-P? 
[01:12:30]  R-A-P.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  How would you wrap it the other way?  W-R-A-P.  I thought you meant like a story wrap.  Like she starts traffic.  Oh, like a professional lingo.  Yeah.  Let's listen to a wrap her traffic report.  Like Greg Geraldo, I believe, has something like a wraparound show in Comedy Central  where he does a bunch of stuff and it wraps around these steps.  This is literal wrapping.  You were able to explain that.  I was hoping that you would have a tough time.  I'm not even sure if that was right.  It just sounded correct.  I thought you were talking about wrapping paper. 
[01:13:00]  What do I know about wrapping?  How do you wrap the traffic?  I wouldn't know a condom if you handed me one.  Wrapping it into a nice bow?  It's supposed to be useful.  All right.  Well, here she is.  Jenny from North Carolina, the traffic girl, wrapping.  Jenny has traffic.  All right.  I'm a little nervous, but here's my wrap.  All right.  You're going to have a good, good drive today.  There ain't no problems on our major roadways.  Looking, looking at country club.  Things will look pretty good like Robin Hood. 
[01:13:30]  Now I'm moving across the triad.  Yo, it ain't too bad.  No, no, no, no, no.  Now things look nice on 68, and I know you ain't going to be late.  So that was your traffic wrap today.  Man, let's get some weather from my weather.  Girl, Austin Cabin us.  Come on, give us a weather, boy.  Give it to us.  Word.  Oh, boy, it is weather guy, by the way.  Good work. 
[01:14:00]  Traffic is bad.  I hate to be blunt.  Let's get a traffic report from...  Hold on.  Hold on.  That's kind of douchey, huh?  Big traffic delays, and you know they're getting bigger.  Problems caused by a drunk driving...  Problem is, she can't rap like a...  That is awful. 
[01:14:30]  But it's, you know, it's endearing, I'm sure, to the people that love when old white ladies rap in movies, too.  They probably find that hysterical.  Well, that would only be endearing if it was during a really tragic story.  You know?  A rubber dub dub, she drowned her babies in the tub.  Jesus.  Anyway, well, the bit has begun.  We're looking for your local news when you see them improv-ing. 
[01:15:00]  Please send that into the program, okay?  Yeah.  I think we were sending them in to Danny's email address.  What's his email address been?  Helloexactly at gmail.com.  Helloexactly at gmail.com.  There you go.  All right, let's say hi to Rick.  He needed a cinder block that weighed a ton to keep down Lacey and Connor Peterson.  You know, just something.  Okay. 
[01:15:30]  And you're nervous about me cursing?  What?  It's been in the news.  You never heard?  Exactly.  It's not Anthony's fault that she was mouthy.  She can rap the traffic.  I can't rap the news.  Good point, Ant.  Good point.  Jiminy Cricket.  Let's go to Rick in Jersey.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, how come you guys haven't been doing your morning report about the woman across the way?  Let me tell you about that bitch.  That tease.  Well, first of all, on sunny days, it's very hard to see into her apartment.  Yeah, well, we got a building across the way, and the woman leaves her window open. 
[01:16:00]  Her blinds and everything.  I don't know what she's got.  Her curtains, shades.  I think they're shades.  They're the shades that, like, they use on cartoons that go.  So, but she never pulls them down.  She's naked in front of the window all the time.  So, we had talked about her, but lately, I don't know why, her shades are down.  What the hell?  I know. 
[01:16:30]  Are they down now?  This was the first day that the shades were down, right?  First day, we come in, shades down.  Do you think maybe somebody...  Maybe people are listening to this program in New York.  No.  She's got to know that she, or a friend of hers maybe knows, that her building is near where  we broadcast from.  So, maybe a little word of mouth, a couple of friends talking, put two and two together,  heard our show, knows where she lives.  Maybe she died.  Maybe she was walking around with that awful, unshaven body, and she slipped and cracked 
[01:17:00]  her fat head on something.  Yeah, that's another reason why we haven't talked about her, Rick.  We got a really good look at her, thanks to the binoculars that Tom Chiasano brought  in.  Yeah.  Ooh.  Yuck.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh, great.  Now the curtains are opening on some other...  I think we got a cougar.  I think we got a cougar over there in that apartment.  A cougar alert. 
[01:17:30]  I'd be more turned on watching Steve Lufo with pig's blood than I was watching that stupid  crow walk around her apartment.  That woman is 80.  So, there's the update.  There's the update, Rick.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah.  All right.  She's not showing anything today.  Game might be over.  She might be on to us.  Game over, man.  The shades are down.  The shades are down.  Hey, there's a smear campaign going on in...  Is this Jersey?  I believe so.  Yeah.  Jersey, known for their clean campaigning.  That last one they had with Corzine and Forrester. 
[01:18:00]  Wow.  They went at each other.  And now there's another election.  I don't even know what this is for.  Who won, by the way?  Forrester or Corzine?  Corzine won and raised taxes and he's just pissing everybody off in the state.  I love it.  I think he did everything he said he wasn't going to do.  Yeah, every promise he made, he's breaking, like, immediately.  At this point, it doesn't matter.  Who cares?  He's in.  What do you got, then?  Last guy who admitted, by the way, he was going to raise taxes, I believe, was, I want 
[01:18:30]  to say, who was the one that ran against Reagan with Geraldine Ferraro, which is...  Who was the Democrat...  He's running with a bitch.  Dukakis?  What was Dukakis?  It was Mondale.  Mondale.  Mondale.  Oh, good old Mondale.  Walter Mondale.  Oh, yeah, okay.  I believe they lost 49 to 1, stage-wise.  And he said he was going to raise taxes, so I think somebody did a little math.  Yeah, that worked.  Yeah, honestly, he doesn't get you anywhere in politics.  And he tried getting a hole in as vice president.  No one likes the hole. 
[01:19:00]  The only Reagan I've ever heard better than that is Colin Quinn.  He does...  You ever give him to Reagan?  Will.  But he just goes, Will.  He sounds just like him.  I thought Ron came back, and I looked over, and it was just Colin.  Yes, Mommy.  He looks like Reagan, but older.  To completely change the subject for a split second here, we've got this giant flat-screen  TV behind Anthony.  Of course we do.  It's massive.  And they just showed Bonds and his 714th homer.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  The guy that caught the ball is not a fan of Barry Bonds. 
[01:19:30]  He hates Barry Bonds.  He even said in the paper over the weekend, how great would it have been if this guy had  the balls to just throw the ball back onto the field?  To throw the ball back onto the field.  How much is that ball worth?  Like a million dollars, maybe?  Did he?  Huh?  Did he?  No, he didn't.  Of course not.  He ran out of there.  I ran out of there with the ball, and he says he hates Bonds, but how great would it  have been just to throw it onto the field?  Stupid.  Saw it in half in the stands.  I wouldn't...  Saw it in half.  Yeah, defacing it would be good.  Yeah, do something crazy with it. 
[01:20:00]  I wouldn't throw Hitler's mustache on a field if I caught it.  Put it in my pocket.  Money.  Tickle it.  Ouch.  Get that back to me.  Find the oldest fan in the stands and, like, you know, put it in her pants or something.  Watch all the young hooligans run after it.  Just go nuts, right?  I've heard people comment on Colin Quinn's Ronald Reagan impression.  Really?  Yeah, this woman had something to say.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  He sounds so...  He'll come in sometimes and go, Will, and I'm like, he's alive. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, it's just you, Colin.  It's Colin.  He fools me all the time.  Will.  All right.  Stan, what do you got here?  I believe this is a race for Congress.  I may be mistaken.  This might actually just be the primary, too.  So it's...  Wow.  So these guys are on the same team?  Yeah.  And they're going after each other?  Yes.  Yeah.  A lot of the primaries, they...  These are the guys, and I love when they do this.  They beat the crap out of each other.  And then when they finally decide on one guy, they're pals again. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Remember when I called you a wife-beating jack-off?  Well, I didn't mean it at all, and everyone should vote for this guy.  Now we have to band together as Democrats or Republicans and vote for this wife-beating jack-off.  Now, my friend, she was lippy.  Well, these two are going at it.  Listen to the accusations here.  A child molester should go to jail.  A drug dealer should go to jail. 
[01:21:30]  Except a politician named Joe Voss used his clout to try and keep them on the street.  God, no, he didn't.  Do you think he used all of his weight and goes, look, I'm pulling his taxes unless that pedophile and that drug dealer are freed?  That is so insulting.  When politicians do, I swear, I wish people were smarter.  Oh, there's enough dummies out there that are listening to this commercial going, oh, my, of course we can't vote for this guy. 
[01:22:00]  Pedophiles?  We've got to vote for the other guy.  Who in their right mind would support that?  It is insulting that a politician would pull that out and try to convince people that there is an actual, another guy that made it this far into politics that he's running for something.  That he would actually have a career in politics based on wanting to have pedophiles and drug dealers just running crazy on the streets.  They've got the dramatic music to help him along. 
[01:22:30]  The music always helps.  It should just have the sounds of crying babies.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  A child molester should go to jail.  Yes.  A drug dealer should go to jail.  Yes.  Except a politician named Joe Voss used his clout to try and keep them on the street.  Did he?  As an assemblyman, Joe Voss asked a judge to go easy on a 40-year-old man convicted for having sex with a 14-year-old girl.  He did not!  He went to a judge and said, could you help out my friend? 
[01:23:00]  He made it his life, right?  Unless it was his son or somebody, it didn't happen.  It didn't happen that way.  Isn't that just amazing?  I screwed up the track.  Hey, it's Voss.  What was that last guy's name?  Was his last name Voss?  Yes, it is.  Oh, what?  It's Voss.  Hey, it's Voss.  Dictionary should be important.  Book should be important.  A politician named Richard Voss doesn't think so. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, man.  The judge to go easy on a 40-year-old man convicted for having sex with a 14-year-old girl.  Voss wrote the judge that the sexual predator had suffered emotionally and shouldn't go to jail.  But Voss never wrote a word about how the 14-year-old victim suffered.  And as Perth Amboy Mayor, Joe Voss called the head of the city's narcotics unit for information on a drug dealer.  Using that information, Voss helped bail out the suspect.  While out on bail, the dealer was arrested again for dealing heroin. 
[01:24:00]  Joe Voss sided with a sexual predator over his 14-year-old victim.  He sided with a drug dealer over the police.  What Joe Voss did wasn't illegal, but it was criminal.  I'm out of your series, and I approve this message.  Yahoo Serious? Who? What's his name?  Albo Serious.  Albo Serious?  How do you vote for that idiot?  Wow.  How do you remember that name?  I would love to know the back story on that guy, the whole being the pedophile thing and the drug dealer thing. 
[01:24:30]  Because, you know, it's not out of the realm of possibility that there is a lunatic out there that would do something like that to just destroy his political career.  He could just go up to a podium and say, I'm a gay American.  That's one way to do it.  Imagine years ago, whoever ran against McGreevy said, some people think having sex with strange men in rest areas is wrong.  We would have thought he was crazy.  And the next thing you know, here this goose goes.  There he is. 
[01:25:00]  Misbehaving.  He goes to bookstores not to read.  He goes to bookstores and drops to his knees while his head is used as an end table.  Yeah, I would love to know the back story on that.  Maybe someone out there has it.  That just sounds completely ridiculous.  Most of the political things, there could be this element of truth in it, but it's so carried away.  A lot of it is the bills that they have people that they say this guy didn't sign. 
[01:25:30]  It's like my competition did not sign a bill that would have kept pedophiles in jail.  But attached to that bill is like $18 billion of road work for some county that this guy is getting half the money from.  And approval to have like gas prices, $12 a gallon.  Yeah, yeah, to go up, cigarette tax, things like that.  And it's attached to a bill about, you know, drug dealers.  Right.  He voted down a bill that would have kept drug dealers in jail longer. 
[01:26:00]  Could you maybe mention the rest of the bill?  That really sucked.  Right.  Let's go to Mike in Freehold.  Mike.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, that story on Voss is true.  He was blooded because that better father's mother had cancer.  He was suffering in jail, allegedly, while waiting for trial.  So he asked the judge to show leniency when sentencing him because he had spent time in jail and his mother was already dying.  Oh, his mother was dying?  He never mentioned a 14-year-old girl.  And what happened?  He never mentioned a 14-year-old girl in that letter, not once. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, okay.  Oh, so the 40-year-old pedophile, his mother was dying of cancer, the big cancer.  And he wrote a letter saying that he should get some leniency?  Yeah, he wrote a letter saying, you know, that he suffered enough because his mother was dying.  And at the time, Corzine backed Voss in the thing.  He never stepped out against him at all.  He said, well, I'm sure there's two sides to every story.  How do you know this, though, sir?  I listened.  I found out about it earlier on when the story first broke.  That sounds legit.  Okay. 
[01:27:00]  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, guys.  Let's listen to this.  Jason in Ohio.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, guys.  About a few years ago, John Glenn in Ohio was running for Senate.  And right towards, like, the last two weeks, I don't know who his opponent was, but his opponent actually started making fun of him being an astronaut  and had a certain commercial where they had a cartoon character of an astronaut and it kind of, and that goofy straw sound,  and it kind of got blown away and the astronaut went flying away and they got a lot of trouble. 
[01:27:30]  That's it.  I'm bailing.  How do you, well, I kind of understand what you're saying.  How do you mock a guy for being an astronaut?  Like, how do you twist that into the, he's so bad, he left planet Earth.  All right, that could be.  Do you want him leaving the planet when you need him the most?  Why?  He's an astronaut.  That's the greatest job on Earth.  Name a greater job than being an astronaut.  Oh, you've got to be getting some women after that.  Gynecology. 
[01:28:00]  No.  You become a gynecologist by being an astronaut, believe me.  Those guys, how, you go into a bar and tell a woman you're an astronaut?  Here's where she goes, I'm sure you are.  Yeah, but then you're John, but you're John Glenn.  Why would being a gynecologist be a better job than an astronaut?  Oh, man, because you get to see what they're like.  Pros and cons, my friend.  Before you go out with them.  No, there's major, major.  Pros and cons, my friend.  There's a major downside.  Oh, I know.  You see the awful, the elderly, the young.  Oh, you're hoping for the young one for getting her first visit. 
[01:28:30]  She comes in, puts her finger by the corner of her mouth and goes, teehee, it's my first  examination.  Right.  And then the guy's like, wow, come on in.  But then there's like, could you help me?  Something's happened overnight.  I don't know what it is.  It's in my socks.  Something fell out in my socks.  Right.  Because, yeah, there's pros and cons to that job, my friend.  Yeah, many more older broads running to a gynecologist than young ones. 
[01:29:00]  Could you tell me what this is?  Right.  Is this a goiter?  A goiter.  No, I do realize that, but I still think that the upside, because every once in a while  someone's going to show up and you're going to go, by golly, that's fluffy and fat.  But no.  You probably don't say it like that as a doctor.  I don't think so.  You're going to have to go through a lot of bad ones.  I know there's a lot of doctors, especially gynos, that you're still a human being. 
[01:29:30]  But they do need that professional bedside manner.  So no matter what it is, you're not going to be able to, what do you put it in your mental  Rolodex to use for later?  Or, you know, you can't, I'm sorry, you're going to need some nitrous oxide for this  examination.  Right.  But it's a gynecologist.  You wake up and just don't feel right.  It's not one of those jobs that you can really take out what you're feeling if you are feeling 
[01:30:00]  amorous.  Can I throw myself under the bus, please?  Please do.  I'll put it in drive.  Inbred, who's a pest, a website you can't mention yet.  Opie just said, being an astronaut is the greatest job on Earth.  Anybody see the irony in that?  Well, you got to start there.  I'll tell you why you're...  Well, you got to do your schooling on Earth.  I mean, come on, help me out here a little bit.  Here's why you were correct in saying that.  Because once you're in space, it's not a great job.  It's just your gig. 
[01:30:30]  It's only a great job when you're on Earth because no one in space can go, really, you  are?  What do you think?  Michael Collins is going to finish you off?  Everybody up there is an astronaut.  I'm an astronaut.  So am I, stupid.  Hit the switch.  No, that goes down as one of the dumber things I've said on the show.  That's a good one.  And incidentally, a really quick asterisk here.  You want to talk about why we talk about the bias of the media?  I'm looking at the Channel 7.  And what do they show?  The Fat Nick trial coming up.  The Batting in Bensonhurst or wherever it was. 
[01:31:00]  And they show the picture of the black guy in the soldier uniform in front of the American  flag like these white racists just beat this innocent soldier instead of realizing this  guy was a thug and robbing a car.  Stealing cars.  In Brooklyn.  And stop.  And then the guys would chase the guy who was death in Harlem.  The black guys would chase that white kid to his death yelling, get whitey.  Where's their faces all over the media?  Where is it?  There's no racial implications.  No, exactly.  Stupid media.  Let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce, what's up?  Yeah, Jimmy, you're crazy, man.  Nobody healthy goes to see a gynecologist. 
[01:31:30]  It's all cottage cheese and bread down there.  That's not true.  There are plenty of girls that have to go for birth control.  There are girls that go for just a pap smear.  Checkups.  Checkups.  Things like that, my friend.  Oh, and they go when they're pregnant.  And the bad definitely outweighs the good there.  Y'all have a good day.  You know what?  It probably does.  Thank you, Bruce.  Why don't we do this?  We've got to take a break.  When we get back, maybe a gyno could call, change your name, change your voice.  I don't care.  And give us the percentage.  Give us the percentage.  We just want a percentage good to bad. 
[01:32:00]  I say one in a hundred.  Is good?  I'm going to say one percent.  No, it's got to be more than that.  Dude, most of the time I think is spent with them prescribing birth control pills and doing pap smears.  I think...  All right, what percentage would you say?  I would say...  Ten percent?  One out of ten?  I'm going to say 50-50.  70-30.  No way.  50-50.  No way 50-50.  No way.  70-30.  You can even send it in on the instant feedback.  All the girls go. 
[01:32:30]  So look outside.  We're just walking down the street.  Pretty much all women go.  You could take the older, older women out of it.  But the older women are going more often.  No, I don't think they are.  Nothing up the average.  No, I don't think they're going more often.  I think they only go when something is wrong.  The hot 16 helps the curve.  But I think you're getting a lot of women in their childbearing years that are getting the checkups, things like that.  And if you're going to help us out on the instant feedback, we want your gyno ID number.  You know how hot it must be if you peek out into your waiting room and you see a nine in a tight pair of jeans or whatever she's wearing? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Blue jeans, perhaps dungarees.  You know she's coming right in.  And her pants are coming off.  You don't even have to buy her drinks.  And you get to see it.  There's some slob just sitting there going, I've been here for four hours.  We'll get to you in a minute, sweetie.  You think the doctors come up with some crazy excuse, too, to get the pants off?  How crazy is a gyno?  What's it?  You got x-ray specs?  No, I'm even.  I'm just talking.  Puts on those wacky x-ray specs. 
[01:33:30]  No, no, no.  I'm even talking just regular doctors at this point.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What, my shoulder hurts?  Take off your pants?  Right.  Yeah, they're not in for that, but they just got to see it.  I got to see it.  You just say, take your pants off.  All right, here you go.  Now hand me my cash.  We don't take that insurance.  Well, you talked about the dentists that go a little off kilter.  A dentist is dealing with you from the jaw up.  There is absolutely no reason anything should take place below that. 
[01:34:00]  But girls wake up after the anesthesia and realize they've been handled.  And the dentist, you know, is just sitting there at some point.  A hot girl is sitting there.  She's under anesthetic.  And he's like, I got to grab those.  I just have to.  Okay, there looks to be something on the number eight upper right molar here that we're going to have to.  I need to touch that.  I need to.  They just lose their minds.  We call it the perv switch.  The perv switch.  Every person out there has lips in the head. 
[01:34:30]  Except for Stalker Patty.  Every person has a perv switch.  The perv switch.  You're going through life.  Right.  A girl just, you see it.  It sets you off.  Need it.  Gotta touch it.  You're on the subway going to work.  You're holding your briefcase.  You've been taking the same train for years.  You're a normal human being.  Girl walks in, just sets you off.  I hope I got the Robertson reports done properly.  I know my boss is going to, oh, I got to rub against her. 
[01:35:00]  And you're in jail.  The next thing you know, you're in jail.  And the sad part is we all think the same thing.  What happened?  But well over 99% of the population can control themselves.  You don't act on it.  But that perv switch is trying to turn on.  Switch.  Boom.  Done.  Then you're in jail and your wife is bailing you out.  The crap you're thinking in your head, but thank God it's still in your head.  Touch that.  Need it.  I think less people can control than you think, though.  I mean, look at the internet and all the sick stuff that goes around.  Right.  People have fought it and fought it, but now that they can kind of let it go.  Yeah, they found an outlet. 
[01:35:30]  That's for sure.  That's a virtual way of exposing and doing all that.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got a lot of gynos on hold.  All right.  Don't go anywhere.  Travis, make sure the gynos stay there because we want to talk to them next.  Okay?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  So much radio, it just might kill you.  No, it won't.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  ONA, Uncut and Live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[01:36:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Mornings with Opie and Anthony.  Tomorrow on the program, Dennis Leary and a few others from Rescue Me.  And Dennis Leary is going to do the walk with us when we walk to XM.  We do that every day at about 8.50.  We leave this fine New York studio, free FM here in New York City.  And we broadcast from the lobby all the way to XM live exclusively on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:36:30]  Tomorrow, Dennis Leary will do the walk, and he's going to be handing out the Rescue Me soundtracks.  And he'll be announcing my new part on Rescue Me.  I'm not important enough.  What happened?  I'm not important enough to have a microphone on this program.  It's the Opie and Jimmy Show.  No, it's not.  Are you going to have a part on Rescue Me?  No.  Oh.  That's not.  I just wanted to find out what that sound of us was saying.  What?  I can't hear this. 
[01:37:00]  What?  I just...  Get loud.  What?  What were we saying?  I wanted to...  See, now Opie's turning into a control freak.  Dude, don't you think Opie's a control freak?  Angry typing guy.  Let me get the Palto cameras in here.  The girls need to see me.  I saw a couple of computers in the office.  I believe those are for in here.  All right.  They're slowing down with their support around here. 
[01:37:30]  We don't like it.  Now today I like XM better.  They were just waiting for the parts.  Now the computers are here, so I'm sure they'll have it wired in in no time.  Yeah, we want the Palto cameras in here so people can check us out all over the world, actually.  The girls have been complaining.  Did you happen to tune in at all?  No!  To the Palto pajama party the girls had?  No.  I tuned in for a little while.  I think it was on Saturday night.  Saturday night.  Yeah, I think I was out Friday night. 
[01:38:00]  I don't remember.  Yeah, Saturday night.  So I tune in.  And, you know, there's a couple of the hot girls from Paltock running around.  And then, I don't know who else they brought.  There were some filler girls, let's just say.  Some filler girls in there.  They were doing like, because it was in Happy Typing Girls.  One of the girls that, she threw the whole thing.  And she works at a photography studio.  So a few of them were by the area where they do the pictures, doing little photo shoots. 
[01:38:30]  Like laying down in their little pajamas and stuff.  Ooh.  Doing photo shoots.  And then you'd be watching that.  And then you'd go to another camera.  And there's stalker Patty with her jaw open.  Because apparently when she types and reads on the computer, she has to open her mouth and stare like a mongoloid.  So all you see is her face in the camera typing.  I wanted to punch my monitor. 
[01:39:00]  Oh.  I actually did talk to, I forgot at the end of the night, I did talk to Happy Typing Girl and a couple of others.  And she said it was a big smash.  But they were all in bed by the time I talked to her.  Really?  What time did they go to bed?  I was late.  It was like five in the morning.  It must have been late.  They were all drinking, though, which was good.  So this was live on Paltock?  Yeah.  Was there nudity?  How were the PJs?  I didn't see any nudity.  Some of them more revealing than others, which was good.  They were wowing.  So they were showing some breasts. 
[01:39:30]  And then the more they drank, the more they wrestled with each other, too.  There was a lot of girl wrestling going on where they're in their PJs pinning each other down and things like that, doing their photo shoots together, kind of hugging each other and stuff.  So that was kind of cool.  Yeah, this is not just a radio show anymore.  It's like, I don't know, a lifestyle.  It's kind of like a cult.  It's an experience that continues after we go off the air.  And I guess through the Paltock cameras, they had a little sleepover party that people were able to check out all over the country. 
[01:40:00]  Girls had the slumber party.  It was a four-camera shoot going on in there.  So they really had a lot of coverage on the place.  And, yeah, you could just pop in and watch it.  I told her she would have turned Patty away.  That was – I told her that would have been so great.  She shows up with her bags and her high hopes for a fun weekend of chips and laughter, and you send her home.  Beat it, aunt.  I would have liked it if the first time she got on camera, they poured pig blood all over her.  Carrie. 
[01:40:30]  Is it true that Master Poe volunteered his services for the party?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, Master Poe said because, you know, well, ladies, you've announced this on the air.  Perhaps I could go and give you security.  No, he didn't.  I don't believe that.  That is the sorriest excuse to get into a pajama party full of girls that I've ever heard.  God bless Master Poe.  Poe.  Poe.  It wasn't even like it was something that you were trying – you didn't even try to come up with something. 
[01:41:00]  He also made the same offer to McGreevy years ago.  You know, you're going to the bathroom late at night.  It's very dangerous.  It would be very dangerous in those bookstores.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  No, gentlemen, I'm very protective when it comes to women, and I did offer my services.  But why?  I didn't want anything.  Why did you really offer your services?  Because that's the way I am.  You've seen what happens.  It's occasionally guys with masks that are stretched and have big mouths stab these women to death. 
[01:41:30]  I've watched movies.  You need security.  So what were you going to do?  Where were you going to stand?  Well, there's two different rooms.  You are not going to admit on the show that it was more than just secure – make sure they were safe?  Gentlemen, I wouldn't be out in the open.  I would be underneath the desks the girls are using to type.  That way, the perpetrators would not see me.  It's just in.  There's going to be a gay slumber party, and they're looking for your services.  Are you going to help them out as well?  Would you help them out?  No, that's okay.  Guys can take care of themselves.  Hey, that's what I'm saying.  At least admit that there was an ulterior motive. 
[01:42:00]  Ulterior motive?  Of course there was.  Are you kidding?  It was a pajama party with mostly hot girls from Pal Talk?  I volunteered my nose in case a chair broke.  And you know that happy typing girl was too scared to tell you no?  Really?  She was afraid of me.  Yes, she was.  She wanted to say no, but she couldn't.  Which – what happened?  Now it's out there.  You shouldn't fear the Po.  Lerock, what do you got?  Fear of the Po.  Po's not dangerous.  Well, when he first told me about this, he was asking me who this girl was, and he said,  oh, I offered my services for the party. 
[01:42:30]  Then he proceeded to tell me that his logic for it was that, you know, all these girls  that are in the room there, every guy's going to know where they are, so they'll just start  showing up, and I'll run the door and screen the door so they don't come in.  Do you know where that is?  No.  No idea.  Do you know where that is?  Yes.  Jimmy probably does.  Anyone else that's been on Pal Talk, do you have any idea where that studio is that  she does Pal Talk from every day and this party was at?  No.  Look at Ben laughing his ass off in the donkey booth.  I could hear Ben from that glass.  Just glee. 
[01:43:00]  Just utter joy.  What do you got, Ben?  Ladies, should I bring my PJs?  I was just down the hall with Mark Chernoff, and we were just laughing about Po's security.  This just in.  There was a serious threat of a pillow fight breaking out.  Gentlemen, I wanted to be there.  Were you going to bring some fluffy nunchucks and hit the girls with them?  Hey, pillows are sharp sometimes.  You can put an eye out.  I don't blame Paul.  I'm not saying he's right.  I do.  I don't blame him at all.  No one even knew where the party was.  I don't blame him because I know he had a complete ulterior motive. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, okay.  If he actually thought anyone was going to fall for this security thing at a pajama party  that no one knows where it's even at.  That no one knows, yeah.  It's in a warehouse somewhere, basically.  It's like NORAD.  They were holding the party at NORAD.  Hey, can I help, gentlemen?  Perhaps, uh...  So were you at the party?  No.  No.  What happened?  Did you watch any of the party?  Uh, no.  I didn't go.  You didn't go.  No?  Well, she emailed me and she said that she didn't need my service. 
[01:44:00]  She finally got the, she finally got the you-know-what to tell you.  Poe, Poe, if you were concerned of their safety, though, couldn't you have watched the entire  thing on PalTalk and if you saw something happen, be the first one to dial the authorities?  Um, no, I don't watch PalTalk.  See, why wouldn't, now, but that would have been being, that would have been keeping them  safe.  I feel that if I'm there, present, if I'm in the room, or outside of the room, in the  area, I... 
[01:44:30]  He was gonna walk the perimeter.  Much more.  I heard he was gonna just walk the perimeter.  Hey, uh, Stingray from Whackbag.  Oh, can we, we can't say the websites yet?  Uh, as long as you don't say, put the, uh, dot com at the end.  Well...  I'm kidding.  I have no idea.  Just, it's Stingray.  Stingray from...  Stingray from his...  Stingray from his...  Work it out.  A lot of bitching today by the host, by the listeners, it's just going back and forth.  We're just beating each other up today.  Stingray, uh, Anthony, will you realize no one cares about PalTalk?  If I wanted to see, uh, TNA, I could punch up millions of effing websites. 
[01:45:00]  Jesus Christ.  That's not true, dude, that people don't care about Pal...  This is what bugs me.  The message boards get mad at PalTalk talk, but I never heard, uh, either of the message  boards or any of the message boards complain, hey, they're talking about our board positively  too much.  No board has ever complained when you talk too much about them in a positive way.  Yeah.  Ever.  If you trash them, they get mad.  Understandable.  Right.  Because I get mad if you trash me.  But then whenever you talk about the other board too much, or PalTalk too much, how can 
[01:45:30]  anyone not like PalTalk?  It's just like a message board.  I find it really strange.  There's Opie and Anthony, uh, uh, factions all over the place now.  Yeah, there's factions.  There's like one message board that hates this message board.  Both message boards hate PalTalk.  This message board doesn't get along with this one because this one used to do this.  Holy crap.  Isn't it amazing?  It's not like PalTalk.  It's like a message board, except you have to talk in real time and you can watch a chick  flash.  Yeah, that's awful.  Why would you want to do that? 
[01:46:00]  Better to put up a funny sig pic of something that's disconnected from you and then type back  an hour later after you can go over the post 50 times and think about what you're going  to say.  I've got to think about what I'm going to say.  I know, I know.  I want to sound smart, so I've got to think about what I'm going to say.  Can't talk in real time?  You speak, I speak.  And then it's much cooler to see a naked girl live.  Yeah.  Live meaning in real time, I should say.  Shicks that maybe you could possibly meet and talk to. 
[01:46:30]  In real time, much cooler than.  Exactly.  Much cooler than seeing it on some dumb porn site.  If, yeah, Stingray, if that's really the Stingray that I know, because I'm friends with  this guy.  I know Stingray.  The reason, and it's not no one cares about PalTalk.  You go there, they max the rooms out.  At that stupid slumber party, there were hundreds and hundreds of people tuned in watching that.  That dopey thing.  And we barely talked about it.  It's just this word of mouth thing. 
[01:47:00]  And people do want to see that.  They want to hook up.  They want to go one-on-one.  They want to, you know, there's cyber sex going on.  Our show has always been very social, very interactive.  And that's why this PalTalk thing is taking off.  You know, and a lot of people aren't happy about that.  But it's taking off because the listeners really want to socialize with each other.  The Borno websites stink, by the way.  I hate them.  And then, look, the message boards are still, and have always been a big part of the show 
[01:47:30]  with the listener interaction.  And they should be.  Always a big part of it.  But why do you get mad if it's like this is just an extension of the message board?  I don't understand how anybody can get pissed.  Why wouldn't you want to look at a girl and talk in real time with other guys?  Instead, I don't understand why you would want to apply.  And everyone on these message boards knows the ones I frequent.  They know the ones I go to, and I post on, and I have a great time going to.  And is it okay that the listeners are going to my brother's restaurant to socialize?  Or is that bad because they're not at home, you know, typing on a message board? 
[01:48:00]  No, you don't have a life.  You're going to PalTalk.  I've got to think about what I'm going to say.  I can't type it in real time.  I've got to think about it for a half hour first.  The show, you know, it's a growing community.  You know, they just want to socialize with each other.  We do five plus hours of radio a day, and then the Opie and Anthony experience continues until we're on the air the next day.  Here's another great opinion.  All night long, they're socializing.  Here's another great opinion by the same place, by the way. 
[01:48:30]  The PalTalk sucks because 99% of your listeners cannot see or even give a crap about it.  We talk about a lot of stuff you can't see or give a crap about.  It's a talk show.  Exactly.  That's part of what's going on on the Internet right now is video conferencing, jackass.  Yeah, we talked about McGreevy.  No one was able to see McGreevy giving a blowjob in a rest area somewhere.  Jesus, Opie.  But we were still able to, you know, discuss it and make it interesting to the listener. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  There are certain things.  You're being a closed-minded jackass.  And I see where you're from, life hacker.  I see where you're from.  God forbid we talk about young girls getting together for a pajama party.  For a pajama party on a video conferencing program that people could watch.  You don't have it.  And here's something.  That's your problem.  Here's something.  I don't have PalTalk.  The only time I see PalTalk is when we do the XM show.  And I was still interesting about how the pajama party went over the weekend.  Yeah, Opie doesn't have it. 
[01:49:30]  And I was, I was, there were some nice pictures in my head as we were talking about it.  You know what PalTalk costs?  60 bucks a year to upgrade to the good video.  It's not like this is a big expensive thing.  And we get nothing per subscription.  Nothing.  Yeah, we just think it's a cool thing as far as the ONA experience goes.  It's one of those things that's cool regardless of the show.  So it's funny as hell to log on and see what some of these people are doing at, you know, 11 in the morning.  Even the guys, I like to see who I'm talking, like that stupid Neo, that oddball, who I love. 
[01:50:00]  But I like to see, he's just like this little weird guy.  He looks like, he's like, not like a full human.  He's like a kind of almost a full person.  He's Master from Master Blaster in Thunderdome.  But it's like even watching that guy just shrink and talk.  That's who you, you're talking to people real time.  Is it true that Neo was in town too?  Because I think we had to carry, my brother had to carry him out of F.H. Reilly's.  Oof, really?  I think they got him, you know, S-faced.  On one beer?  I don't know.  Maybe someone that was at F.H. Reilly's could tell us, call up and tell us what happened. 
[01:50:30]  Because I think Neo flew in and they just got him just hammered.  I haven't been there yet.  I want to go to the restaurant and have a nice steak.  We talk about video games too.  Not a lot, but that's something that not everyone is interested in or does.  It's part of popular culture, you tool.  And people do these things.  You guys talk about video games?  I drop right out.  Yeah, Jimmy doesn't know about it, doesn't care about it.  But what do you think, Lifehacker?  Everything we talk about is to revolve around you and things that interest you.  That's right.  Go shove it.  You know something? 
[01:51:00]  Ban.  Ban him!  I'm banning you right now.  Now every instant feedback you send, you'll get a message that says, thank you for your instant  feedback.  And you'll think that maybe it went through.  You know something?  It didn't.  Go screw off.  Norton, how is it again with the, uh...  Oh, they don't like the real-time talkers.  Everybody's talking in real-time.  But I got to sit for a half hour before I type something.  I got to sit for a while and put my funny signature picture up.  And people say, no way, that's Stingray.  He's on PalTalk every day. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, I know.  I've seen Stingray there.  Let's go to Rich in, uh, Bohemia.  Rich, yeah.  Yes.  Welcome aboard, Rich.  I actually, uh, have a brother-in-law that's getting back to the gynecologist thing.  He, uh, we were talking to him about a month ago.  He said, man, you got the greatest job in the world.  He goes, yeah, but for every one good one, there's ten bad, ten horrible, horrible things  that you got to deal with.  And the gynecologist might not be complete perverts, though, so I might have a different  ratio.  Yeah, yeah, well, you know, he also said that there's, like, this one woman who he 
[01:52:00]  had to leave the room to go take, like, a breath because the smell was so bad.  Yeah, you're going to get that.  Wow.  I'm telling you, I don't think it's worth it.  Try dating.  You get the same thing.  She's in your apartment.  At least if you're a doctor, you could throw something on there before a lot.  And I would imagine, also, if you're filing the stuff away in the Rolodex later, you  know, you're going to be, uh, you know, trying to also get those horrible memories  out of there also, you know?  I don't doubt it.  All right, thank you.  Before Lifehacker was banned, he got one more in. 
[01:52:30]  Why talk, all caps, why talk about something that 99% of the listeners don't take part  in?  Like what, girls?  Yeah.  Hey, idiot, do you realize 99% of the listeners don't take part in instant feedback, yet we  read them like I'm reading yours?  The last one you'll ever put through, Lifehacker, the last one you'll ever put through.  Go screw.  Everyone has a computer.  All right, listen, the suits are peeking in the Dunkin' booth over there.  They're panicking.  We haven't taken a break yet this hour. 
[01:53:00]  Frank in Jersey, what's up?  Really fast.  Well, that was last hour's break.  I just wanted to know how much longer this live read for PalTalk's going to go on.  Live read for PalTalk.  You don't have it?  Do you have it, sir, or no?  No.  No.  No, but this is a good live read.  It's gone after like, what, 15 minutes, something like that?  We don't even have it.  Those dopes at PalTalk don't even, they're cheap, too cheap to come across with spots.  You're right, sir.  We shouldn't even mention them until they buy some time on this goddamn station.  If you want to see hot girls, you go to MySpace.com slash Jim Norton. 
[01:53:30]  You'll see pretty girls.  All right.  I like Bill.  He says, you guys talk about stuff too much.  Could you not talk about stuff?  Bill stinks.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi, there's nothing I like better on a sunny day than going fishing and listening to ONA.  Sometimes when I go out, Uncle Henry makes me wear fishnets and a corset.  Opie and Anthony! 
[01:54:00]  These pointy shoes hurt my feet.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202.  Opie and Anthony!  Thank you, Ben.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up, Ben?  I don't know.  Apparently, you don't want me doing the show today.  I keep pushing.  I swear to God. 
[01:54:30]  Opie, why don't you want Anthony to talk?  It's an Opie and Anthony.  Ben had to put it on that side.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  The Da Vinci Code doing very well at the box office made, what, $77 million across the world.  I hope he thinks I'm Alan Combs.  No.  I would do this if I thought you were Alan Combs.  Go.  You've got to turn me way down.  But, Sean.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  But the war, Sean, is something that the president just went into recklessly. 
[01:55:00]  Is this on even at all?  I've got to tell you, man.  I've got to kick out of the Hannity and Combs interview Ant and I did on Friday.  Yeah.  Not a lot of people saw it because, you know, it was on Friday night.  Thanks for the time slot, Sean.  I wasn't even home watching it.  Who was home watching it?  I'm watching it.  I think I watched part of it on my cellular phone.  Our fans saw it in a bar somewhere with the sound down.  But I got a kick out of it. 
[01:55:30]  I didn't mean to say it, but we start the interview and Sean Hannity, you know, just talking and talking and talking.  And we're turned to the right, listening to Sean Hannity, question after question after question.  You only saw what they decided to air, the edited version, right?  So it seemed like we were just talking to Sean Hannity for like 15 minutes straight.  And next thing you know, I hear a voice to my left and it's Alan Combs.  And I didn't mean to say this, but I turned and went, oh, he talks? 
[01:56:00]  He got so pissed off.  He stopped.  He stopped his question.  He did like a double take and looked around the room a little like, yeah.  He gave me a glare.  Like, how dare you?  But I was thrown off because it was Sean Hannity.  I thought maybe Alan was preparing for another segment or I don't know.  I didn't even realize he was on set with us.  And all of a sudden this voice comes from the left side.  I go, oh, he talks?  Yeah. 
[01:56:30]  It was fun.  For, let's see, Stingray's checking in.  The real Stingray's saying that wasn't him.  We knew it wasn't you, Stingray.  I know from the content that it wasn't him.  And other people that are bashing the video conferencing pal talk missed Saturday when wife, let's see, one of the guys, T-Man, let his wife shoot him in the butt with a BB gun.  I saw that, too.  Hysterical.  She lines up with a BB pistol. 
[01:57:00]  He takes his pants down, bends over.  She shoots him right in the butt and he flies against the wall.  He's another guy that, like, she stun guns him.  It's just you get to see some interesting stuff.  Why would you want to see that?  You guys just pal talk all weekend long when you're home?  I did this weekend because I was really...  Just on in the background all weekend long.  Yeah, when you watch it, just leave it.  You're checking either the message board or you're doing stupid MySpace stuff.  Just leave it on.  Pop in.  What's going on?  It's so much.  It's brief.  It's quick.  I started yoga. 
[01:57:30]  No, you didn't.  You're right.  Please say you didn't.  I did.  What are you doing with yoga?  Trying to get into better shape and it's healthy.  Yoga is not easy.  But, like, working out.  It is.  But I have a bad right foot.  A lot of people say if you pick the right yoga, it's a lot tougher than working out.  Yeah.  I'm telling you right now.  I had alcohol yoga.  I had a girl come to my house.  I'm going to go to the defense.  I'm thinking of doing a little yoga myself.  Is it yoga with happy endings?  No, no, no, no. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, really.  I had the girl come to my house.  I actually got a massage last night with no happy ending.  It was one of the best I ever got.  I'm going to go keep seeing her.  And she's hot.  She's an Asian girl.  But she's nothing sexy.  Wow, what a surprise.  But nothing sexy.  She's like a real masseuse.  Yeah.  An animal.  It was fantastic.  But did you just go for a regular massage?  No, she came to me.  I don't go.  They come.  No, I'm saying.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  If you went for a regular massage, you weren't looking for any, uh...  You know, I just wanted a regular...  I didn't need a...  I'm going to go home now.  And that's me crying. 
[01:58:30]  I went for the yoga I had come over.  It was only 60 bucks.  And she was a nine.  Showed up.  I was like, uh-oh.  This is going to be hard.  Wait, if a yoga instructor showed up to your pad, there's something else going on.  No, not necessarily.  A lot of people...  Private yoga for $60?  Yeah.  How long?  How long?  An hour?  No way.  60 bucks an hour?  You think it should be less than that?  Private yoga?  No, it should be like $150 if someone attractive is coming over.  I don't think she's a really...  I think she...  I don't think she's good at it.  No, no.  She really was good at it. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah?  I don't think she was like a complete...  Like, I don't know if she's an instructor or she was just good enough to instruct a novice.  But it was great.  She walked me through all the stuff.  But there was no...  I get vibes on people.  There was no sexual vibe coming off her.  She was just nice and solid.  And it was assisted yoga, where she'll assist you into poses.  Where was the ad?  Assisted yoga?  I'll tell you.  Listen to me.  But it wasn't...  Something is really suspicious here.  I know.  Assisted yoga.  Well, I see you're trying to do...  What is it?  Backward dog or whatever the...  I know. 
[01:59:30]  I couldn't tell you one thing but the full lotus.  She helped me with backward dog and all this stuff.  Because I have a bad foot.  Did she?  There's one you do.  Dude, I'm getting into an embarrassing thing here that happened.  All right.  Sorry.  I don't know.  It's okay.  It's just...  It's bordering on humiliation.  You get scared.  I did get scared.  Please tell me you farted in her face that she's assisting you.  Not in her face.  Oh, no.  You let one go.  You were a little gassy.  On her.  She's probably used to it.  No, no, no.  Dude, she's a nine. 
[02:00:00]  I'm doing the yoga and she has me...  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  There are pockets of gas that reside inside of a person.  And when bent in certain positions, they may come out.  Dude.  I was...  One of the positions...  I don't know what it's called, but you're like in the stupid dog, which means you're  basically like put your hands on the floor flat and stretch out straight and put your  feet...  It looks like you're an upside down V.  That's pretty much close to what the dumb dog pose is.  And there's one you do where you take your right hand and your right foot and it stays 
[02:00:30]  on the floor and your left hand comes up in the air and your left foot comes up in the  air.  It almost looks like you're ready to do a cartwheel and you hold that pose.  It's kind of hard to do.  It's a balance thing.  It sounds silly.  It is, but it's really good for you.  But she holds me up during those because my balance is not that good.  And as I'm struggling...  Oh, you teetering ass.  As I'm struggling, she's holding me...  Right on her. 
[02:01:00]  It was so awful.  She's 24 years old.  Oh, no.  She's a nine...  A 24-year-old nine yoga instructors coming to your pad to do private yoga lessons.  There's something that you're not doing.  No, no, dude.  I would talk...  Wait, wait.  Was it as bad as some of the ones we've had to experience in here as far as...  It was...  It was...  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me...  That was exactly what it was like.  Just embarrassing.  And she didn't care. 
[02:01:30]  She was like, oh, you know, a little laugh.  Yes.  Where was the ad for this?  You might be used to that.  It was a legitimate Craigslist ad.  Craigslist.  I'll tell you, if it was...  Craigslist.  If it was...  99% of Craigslist is really not sexual stuff.  Murderers?  What?  They're killers?  99% of the ads on Craigslist are not legitimate.  Oh, they are.  They're disguised as legitimate that go...  I mean, they're not sexual.  That bring you towards some kind of sexual encounter.  Why is a woman that is a nine going over a complete stranger's house based on nothing  more than an internet contact to do something for money? 
[02:02:00]  Why would anyone?  Like, you don't understand what I'm saying?  It's like...  But that seems like a thing that's a little more intimate than I'll come over and mow your  lawn.  There was no talk of massage.  No talk of anything else.  Actually, because she does...  After the yoga session, we sat there and just chatted for probably 45 minutes, completely  non-sexual about the business and about acting classes.  I know that definitely...  What do you think the motive is, though?  I was supposed to end in naked yoga.  No, not at all.  You just didn't know, like, the code word or something. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, you're very savvy.  It's $60 for the basic yoga, but if you did the code word, then it's hot, nine, 24-year-olds  completely naked in your apartment doing yoga moves.  You're savvy with the massage girls, but there's this yoga thing, but I think there's a whole  other language.  It's hard for me to believe that it was just completely legit.  You're speaking, like, Japanese.  She speaks Greek, perhaps, and you're trying, you know, Japanese. 
[02:03:00]  She don't know what she's talking about.  Or maybe you have to put the time in.  Third or fourth lesson in, then start getting on.  Do you really want to learn yoga, or do you want to see me naked?  No, no, here's the difference.  $60 is actually not that expensive.  She would have said, well, I started at $60.  There would have been some, I know all the lingo.  Nobody comes in.  I understand you know.  You know massage girl lingo.  Same thing.  Not yoga girl.  But this lady's coming over for $60.  That's just hard for me to believe.  She's probably not a complete problem.  To risk her life for $60. 
[02:03:30]  Right, right, right.  And she's a nine.  And believe me, she's risking her life.  Maybe she's not certified as far as she can't teach a class, because maybe you need a certain  certification to actually teach a class.  Did she have an Adam's apple?  No.  Hi, daddy.  Do the lotus.  By the way, Bo from upstate New York.  Dude, why are you talking about something that 47.5% of your listeners can't do?  It's a good point, Bo.  Yeah, we got to play the percentages.  And Matt from Long Island.  Hey, Ope, did Ben lend you his hairbrush for the Hannity interview? 
[02:04:00]  What?  Matt, you're a guy.  Stop commenting about how I look.  Yeah, your hair wasn't nice enough for Matt.  Hey, Matt, how would you have liked Opie's hair to be?  A little more sexy for you?  Maybe Matt would have liked it.  Something brushed back a little, so Matt could have sat there and gone, Opie looks more handsome  this way, you faggot.  Wait, what is it with guys that have to comment on how you look or how I look or Jimmy looks?  Matt, you're a guy.  Stop commenting about how we look. 
[02:04:30]  In mass defense.  That's not your job.  When girls comment on how we look, then we'll sit there and cry at night.  There are times when Opie looks so rugged.  There are times where he looks soft-spoken and tender.  I have different Opie moods.  Matt, it's called not giving a you-know-what.  Right, especially what Matt thinks.  The interview was at 9-something at night.  I took a nap.  I went to Fox Studios.  I had bed hair.  And they said, you want me to fix the bed hair?  I said, ah, maybe if you want to pat it down a little bit.  Sure.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
[02:05:00]  I know.  We're not in this to-  I just don't care.  To be TV stars.  We don't duty ourselves up every day when we come in.  It's a job.  We come in, too.  Half the time, we're not shaving.  And then guys are the first ones that will jump out and go, Anthony, why don't you put  on a couple of pounds?  You're looking a little thin.  Am I?  Do you like them plump, do you?  Do you like a nice fat man like Vito to spoon with?  I love you, Johnny Cakes. 
[02:05:30]  Does that get you hot?  Well, see, stuff like this is better.  A mule yanker from a website we can't name.  Was that the shirt that XM bought Opie?  Okay.  That is the shirt that XM-  How does a man know that?  No, but that's okay.  But how does a guy know?  I couldn't tell you if you ever wore that.  That was one of the shirts that XM bought me, yes.  Yes.  They tried to clean me up a little bit and we went on a shopping spree, yes.  That was one of the shirts XM bought me. 
[02:06:00]  If you're a guy, that's better than asking about my hair.  No, there's nothing wrong with a guy.  He didn't like your hair, Opie.  He'd have liked it a little more manageable and in control.  Something he probably fantasizes running his fingers through.  See, if somebody's looking at you, though, I don't know.  I got to play devil's advocate here.  Play devil's faggot here.  I don't want to.  At the Comedy Cellar, one of the first things we do is if you come in and your appearance  is off, you got to pounce.  We teased, one night, me and Keith Robinson, we teased Joe Matarese to the point where he 
[02:06:30]  had to leave the – he had to leave.  And Joe's a comic.  He can take it.  He teased his hairdo one night so badly he had to leave.  Jim, I get that.  Yep.  Big difference.  That's if I just showed up on the Henny and Comb set with just my hair just so ridiculous.  And friends doing it.  You would have to really look closely at my dumb hair to try to come up with a hair joke,  which, by the way, they came up with many of them on the message board, all commenting  about my hair because it wasn't combed properly. 
[02:07:00]  And friends goofing on the way you look or clothes, that's funny.  You know, that's fine.  It's like a complete stranger, a guy going, what, you know, what are you wearing?  Or you should put on a couple of pounds.  Or I don't like your hair.  Or you're not attractive to me.  Like, I've heard guys where they've been like, you know, Anthony, you should talk.  I find you ugly.  Oh, do you, Bill?  Do I really care if Bill doesn't like the way I look? 
[02:07:30]  I like the way you look.  I like.  I would.  Boy, I'd feel so much better if Bill thought I was attractive.  I never understood that.  Someone was telling me to calm down because they were just going for a Ben, you know,  Opie joke.  But it's not even close.  And Ben doesn't own a brush.  Yeah, that's the funniest part.  Actually, I haven't combed my hair in 20 years.  20 years is not a comb through it. 
[02:08:00]  I don't even have a comb or brush in my apartment.  No?  Nope.  What do you do with it?  I just, I don't know, just kind of towel dry it and just whatever happens happens.  It's a piece of skin.  I swear to God, I have not combed my hair in easily 20 years.  Can I wet my fingers with my tongue and just, if there's a loose hair, just put it in place?  If you need to.  Just pat it down.  Because just when you said that, I'm like, you know what?  I don't have a brush or a comb.  I don't own one.  Steven Rockland, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to ask a little Jimmy.  Did he ask the actress what to do with his hands when he was acting? 
[02:08:30]  She probably would have told him to put them over my ass.  That's very good.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what do you have for the show today?  Yeah, what did we learn?  I learned today that being an astronaut is the best job on earth.  Right.  I hope you guys suck, too.  All right, thank you, Mike.  All right, Mule Yanker, I get the joke.  Three times already.  Anthony looks like Robert Reed.  Anthony, you should have been wearing a robe.  Mule Yanker, change your IP because you're banned.  Right.  There you go. 
[02:09:00]  I weigh, I'm perfect for my height.  I'll pick you up.  I'm not a fat bastard like you, Mule Yanker.  Sorry.  I eat healthy and I stay thin.  Sorry I'm not a fatty like you, Mule Yanker.  That's why you look good in those little jackass.  We're very surly today.  The fight will continue.  The second half of the Opie and Anthony show exclusively on XM.  We're just going at it today.  Where we can curse at the listeners.  One of the only shows where we beat up our listeners and they beat us up back. 
[02:09:30]  Who said that?  Billy Connolly?  Yeah.  He's like, it's brilliant.  Mule Yanker.  Are we on yet?  La la la la la. 
[02:10:00]  I hear it.  Why don't we hear any lyrics with these?  Sounds like we're on.  Yeah, we're on.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I knew when I heard myself through the music that we would be on.  We heard each other.  All right.  Let's begin our walk.  Where's spring?  Yeah, it's going to be a fast walk today.  It's cold in New York.  Yep.  Stupid weather.  Stupid global colding.  Well, boy, we were a little angry and surly on that show. 
[02:10:30]  Perfect Monday morning show.  Yelling at the listeners because they're a bunch of fucking cocksuckers.  You know what it is, Anthony?  We have a case of the Mondays.  Well, what the hell is that?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  You know what, though?  I think it shows that we're getting more listeners.  Why?  With the FM show. 
[02:11:00]  Why?  Because the more people that call up and bitch and complain.  Bounce.  Bounce.  Have always meant.  Bounce.  Bounce.  It's always meant that there are newer listeners coming in or people that are, like, they don't  like the show that much.  They're angry about what we're talking about.  All right.  So I'm going to say something if we walk by these people.  Let me just see if they look.  You know what?  Hold on.  Let me say this.  Okay.  Let me say this in front of this lady.  So we're doing a show on how Jews are hurting America.  Oh, shit.  Did she look?  No.  Can I...  She ran in fear.  Can I point out an observation? 
[02:11:30]  Hi.  Ooh.  Can I point out an observation?  This young kid in front of us has...  You can make one.  ...has WOW stickers, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He decided to walk in front of us and try to hand out the WOW stickers to just the regular  pedestrians...  Yeah.  ...in New York City.  I've seen just about everyone shake their head no.  Because it's like on every corner there are people handing out things to, like, strip  clubs and...  Here's the point.  You never grab anything.  Here's the point.  Yeah.  Can he be behind us so we don't have to see people say, no, they don't want the Opie and 
[02:12:00]  Anthony WOW.  Yeah.  Go behind us.  They don't even know what it is, though.  They don't know what it is.  They don't even look.  They just see a handout.  I'd do the same thing.  Me too.  It could be gold doubloons.  No, I would see those, Anthony.  I bet it would never be, though.  I would see gold doubloons.  All right.  Look at this baby.  Oh.  Nice retard.  Your baby's ugly, man.  Oh, Jesus.  No, don't ever...  Oh, my God.  Don't say that.  I am so embarrassed. 
[02:12:30]  Holy shit.  I finally got my bit.  I've been looking for a bit.  That's not your fault.  That is a bad bit.  That's not a good bit.  That's not a bad bit.  What?  She's going to kick my ass?  No, but she's probably going to drown her kid.  What's wrong with that?  You're right.  It is ugly.  Everyone thinks their baby is the cutest baby on earth.  You look fat in that jacket, miss.  Oh, aren't you hearing me?  Okay.  I can't walk with you people anymore.  This is too embarrassing.  You should have that removed. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, my God.  I see what you mean, too.  That stupid chocolate chip on the side of her fat face.  Let's just pay.  Those boots were made for eating.  How you doing, fat calves?  You're right.  I had to get involved.  Jesus.  Nice wig, lady from Total Recall.  Hey, look at these two chimps.  How you doing, bum?  Hey, Mac.  Not today.  It's too cold out. 
[02:13:30]  Nothing.  You deal with the cold.  We're going inside where it's warm so we can broadcast.  Yeah, make fun of the big black guy, Jimmy.  Yeah, you can't hear me.  He's not a word.  He took a sticker.  Not a word.  See?  Hey, Martha Stewart with AIDS.  Wash your hair.  Exactly.  How you doing, sir, with the fat stomach?  I know, I know you're growing a beard, so no one notices you're bald.  We get it. 
[02:14:00]  This guy's walking with signs around him, like those two little signs.  Hey, what college did you go to?  How you doing, failure?  Hello, ugly couple.  How are you?  Which one's the woman?  Holy.  He said hi to Jimmy.  Hello, ugly couple.  Hi.  Hello, jogging man who will probably make it two blocks before dying.  You are a great mugging victim.  All right.  He's dressed like he's going on safari. 
[02:14:30]  All right.  You know what?  That's all you get as far as the walk goes.  I like that, though.  That was fun.  Hey, no ass.  Second half of the O.P. and Anthony show will begin in moments.  The O.P. and Anthony XM202.  Where the fuck am I?  The fuck is it?  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  We played on TV screens for drawings.  They ran back and took off with a family car.  People making nasty comments about women. 
[02:15:00]  Virus spreading in our area.  Find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button!  Don't be an Anthony!  I'm a black ninja, fuckface!  All right, we remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dogg on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  There's going to be some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log you're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit!  Yahoo! 
[02:15:30]  The O.P. and Anthony show.  Holy shit.  Yahoo!  Indeed.  Oh!  With O.P.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Your old man.  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating boob.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock.  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawk fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls. 
[02:16:00]  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:16:30]  All over.  That was a short walk, but very entertaining.  Oh, my God.  O.P., O.P., O.P., Jim, caller, O.P., O.P., O.P., Jim. 
[02:17:00]  My God.  You just had a record today.  That's right.  With dumps.  Let's go to Mike in Canada.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  I'm waiting for my smoothie.  Your smoothie?  I was about to get a hot chocolate.  Hey, I was going to get in a fine walk, okay?  Oh, you like the walk today?  That was very funny.  It was quick, but my God, I was laughing and embarrassed at the insults that were flying. 
[02:17:30]  When Jimmy said, hello, ugly couple, it was really, we couldn't tell who was the man and who was the woman.  Oh, yeah?  The guy just goes, hello.  He said, hello back, instead of doing what he should have, shot Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm putting up a, you know, stupid pal talk program that everyone seems to hate.  Yeah, they just hate it.  Because, uh, first of all, they see attractive girls.  Mike, you still there? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah, I'm still here.  What part of Canada?  Uh, London, Ontario.  Uh, where's that?  Uh, about two hours west of Toronto.  Are you near Niagara Falls?  No, nowhere.  Niagara, Niagara Falls?  Because, uh, Regis and, uh, Kelly are at Niagara Falls.  Are you at a lunch on chocolate?  Why are they at Niagara Falls?  And it's official.  Regis should never leave the studio.  Oof.  Because, uh, the studio lights cover up a world of hurt. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, look at me, commenting about how a guy looks on TV.  What are you doing?  Well, now I get it.  Look, it's very windy here.  Now I get it.  We're here, it's very windy, I'm wearing a sweater.  Look, he's got a big sweater on.  He's cold.  Steve in Cincinnati.  Welcome.  Hey, what's wrong, guys?  What's up?  That walk this morning was awesome.  You like that one?  Well, actually, when, when, when Opie said, or, yeah, I was, Opie told that lady she had  an ugly baby.  Yeah.  Well, she did.  And when Jimmy said that, uh, that Jack can make you look back, I sat there and I cried 
[02:19:00]  almost, because I laughed so damn hard.  The guy in the truck next door to me was looking at me like I was nuts.  Glad we didn't do it on 3FM.  That guy would have dumped out of it.  No kidding.  Jesus Christ, what a baby that guy is.  No kidding.  Faggot.  Well, I guess it's time to do the dump report.  Yeah, we might as well get it over there.  Hope you have an hour.  All right, let's go.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Well, here it is, all the dumps for this Monday, May 22nd, 2006. 
[02:19:30]  Started early, 634.  Opie with Go Fuck Yourself.  A marginal, uh, it's one of those gray areas again.  Wow.  Uh, at 648, not, not too long later, Opie, stop listening to every fucking word.  What's wrong with that?  Did you forget, uh, we're on, uh, FM radio at that, uh, time?  What's wrong with that one?  Uh, 753. 
[02:20:00]  Opie, something fell out.  Referring to a vagina after a gynecology discussion.  Something fell out.  Look at the next one.  Uh, 755.  Jim, Michael Collins is gonna finish you off.  What's that?  Why the fuck would they dump that?  It's about, it was a handjob reference.  But why would they?  Who's Michael Collins?  Oh, he's an astronaut.  It was an astronaut thing about, like, uh,  What mission?  Um, he was actually the one, he was the farthest man from the Earth ever. 
[02:20:30]  The most isolated man ever.  Because he was, uh, flying.  Hold on, I'm telling you, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went down to the moon,  Michael Collins stayed on the, uh.  Oh, he was a man module.  He was on the thing.  But the fact, this guy is fucking, you know what it is?  Al Dukes on vacation, so this guy's a fucking Pete Panic.  I've got to talk to him tomorrow.  Better safe than sorry is what he's thinking.  But dude, Michael Collins is gonna finish you off.  Who the fuck is dumping that?  Anyone that thinks that we don't like being on XM, I mean, you know, it doesn't really matter to me if they dump stuff. 
[02:21:00]  It's just annoying on principle.  Like, Jesus, dude.  A caller at, uh, 756.  It's all cottage cheese and bread pudding down there.  That we were talking about the vagina.  And you can't even say whack bag?  It's, Opie, whack bag.  Like, the guy, hey, so-and-so from whack bag, and you can't say that?  Yeah, I know.  Well, because, uh, we can't mention websites yet.  Yeah, but that's not even a website.  They're linked to porn sites.  The word whack bag, you can say.  No, but I was mentioning whack bag, the website. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah, but you just said so-and-so from whack bag.  Oh, I see.  And they dumped that.  Well, he questioned it, though.  In parentheses, it says, we take this out.  Yeah.  He wasn't really sure.  823, Opie, giving a blowjob in a rest area somewhere.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing at all, Opie.  Rest areas.  You can't mention rest area.  What about the FCC, Jimmy?  843, Opie, farted in her face.  All right, look, they got something against me now. 
[02:22:00]  That's too many.  And 844, Jimmy, on her, referring to a fart.  I said on her.  That's amazing.  Farts are very, very dangerous.  Yeah, they're very dangerous.  These days on regular radio.  Yeah, fart is very dangerous.  I really want, and I mean this, I know I smashed the liberals.  I really want conservatives out.  Yeah, midterm elections.  And if one more person tells me that Clinton appointees, I know all about that in the FCC. 
[02:22:30]  But the bottom line is, shit rolls downhill.  It's just a whole vibe.  Whoever's in charge.  I mean, again, oh, it's just.  You got to kiss ass on the person above you to get a better job.  So what these people do, even if they're not of the same ideology, they will kiss ass on the conservative right to get ahead.  So, yeah, I'm with Jimmy.  I hate liberals, like far-left liberals.  Can't stand them.  The left, a bunch of idiots.  Just as bad as the far right. 
[02:23:00]  Yes.  But the teeter-totter has gone too far on one side.  Midterm elections, all bedwetting, tree-hugging liberals.  That's who I'm voting for.  Not that I vote, but I mean, that's who I'm going to.  I want someone who only hyphenates African-American.  Yes.  Gay-American.  I want it as bleeding heart.  I want someone elected who's against the death penalty.  I want a bleeding ass liberal.  Yes.  Someone that's just been rammed so many times with their lifestyle. 
[02:23:30]  At the back of their thighs are pink.  All right.  Oh, there was a lot of dumps today.  Yep.  You don't mind dumps that you know should be taken out.  That's great, but it's like, on her?  Come on.  On her.  Michael Collins is going to finish you off?  And he's so busy up there.  There's no way he's got time to jack you off when he's got two guys in a lunar module on the moon.  Especially with that big glove.  It's all slow.  Yeah, he's got a big glove. 
[02:24:00]  That's not going to feel good.  Not going to be able to get a good gription.  That's ridiculous.  Let's say hi to Sean in Canada.  Sean.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi, sweetie.  Hi, Sean.  I'm just kind of curious when Jimmy's going to go do the Montreal Comedy Festival.  They asked me this year.  No, they didn't.  You're right.  It was back and forth for a while.  But the bottom line is they wanted me up there for too many days.  And then finally they cut it down to like four days. 
[02:24:30]  I can't miss that much radio.  So they're like, why don't you guys broadcast up there?  And Open Eye and Anne had talked about maybe broadcasting at the festival.  But with CBS XM, it's just too new yet to figure out like who gets what, where we go.  So that's why I'm not going up this year.  We just couldn't figure out how to get it done.  And I can't leave radio.  I'm not leaving for four days for anything.  Yeah, we wanted to be up there ourselves too, but oh well.  Yeah, when are you guys coming to Canada?  Actually, I think we're trying to get up there in the summer.  I may book a gig up there sometimes.  Yeah, I think we're trying to get up there in the summer. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, you guys got to go do Montreal.  You'll have a hell of a party.  We want to wait to have a bigger fan base so people show up.  There you go.  Nothing worse than a bunch of Frank people just staring at you while you talk.  I think we're supposed to be up there in, when were we?  There was something going on there they wanted us up there for.  I don't know.  We'll be up there maybe for the Stanley Cup Finals in August.  See, because the hockey season goes right a really long time.  It's a season that goes forever.  Forever.  And ever and ever and ever.  We get it.  All right, have a good day, gentlemen.  Thank you.  And I hope you don't. 
[02:25:30]  Reno, Mississippi.  Hey, guys.  How are you guys doing?  All right, Reno.  All right.  I just wanted to call.  I hadn't got to tell you, since you've been on Free FM,  I used to call all the time when you were on Just XM.  But anyway, you're doing a great job.  And I know I'm kissing ass.  But I love little Jimmy Cakes and just wanted to say good job.  And that's a good word.  What do you like about the new show?  You know, the show that's on Terrestrial, I guess, 
[02:26:00]  before we do the exclusive content for XM.  I guess it would be.  Oh.  You want to talk about, I was at the cellar.  One guy that thinks he's helping.  Oh, Christ.  Saturday night, and I was talking to this girl.  And we were going to get along.  Well, she's a very pretty girl.  We were chatting.  Her and her sister were there.  And she had nice breasts.  I really hadn't stared at them.  And her sister was talking about them.  Well, yeah, you have such big boobs.  And she's like, no, I don't.  And I'm looking at them.  And I just go, 34 C?  And her and her sister looked at each other. 
[02:26:30]  And she goes, you just gave me the creeps.  And you just creeped out my sister.  Because I guessed them accurately.  I completely creeped the girls out.  Of course.  But I'm like, what's the matter with you?  Would you rather I guess 38B?  Like a big flatso?  Big fat back.  Yeah.  No cup.  I'll guess 44A.  Do you realize if you're a 44A,  you're either a male or you should be shot?  I could have had you shot for this.  It's called a flatso. 
[02:27:00]  They're out there.  I love flatso.  Let's go to Tony in Missouri.  Tony.  Hello, sir.  Tony.  Hello.  Let's go.  Hey, man.  Hello.  Let's go.  Hey, what's up?  Let's go.  I'd like to work for Michael Collins'  gription on his dick.  Yeah, you get no gription.  I've used the word gription for forever.  You got to get gription on that wrench.  It's one of Anthony's cool words, man.  Yeah, sir.  It's like regs and gription.  Regs.  Don't worry. 
[02:27:30]  It's just how Anthony likes to talk from time to time.  Yeah, man.  He's all into that beatnik, you know, man.  Rules and regs.  It's all about the regs when you have your gription.  When he talks about religion, he goes,  too many people follow the JC.  Yeah, man.  The big guy upstairs.  Yeah.  You know.  I turned into a beatnik.  Because I said gription.  That's right, Manson.  Because you've got your own way of talking, man.  Yeah, man.  You're like Lenny Bruce, daddy-o. 
[02:28:00]  You just kind of, you know, spit it out the way it comes out, man.  It doesn't matter.  It's a script of consciousness.  Oh, man.  It's gription.  You know, Voss still thinks he played Lenny Bruce well.  If you're listening, Voss, you didn't.  Of course he didn't.  Except you're older than he would be.  You know, this is where I really want to go.  I want to go where Lynette lives.  Lynette.  She must be in town.  What's up, Lynette?  Well, I just wanted to know if you guys are ever coming to Western Canada.  That's where I want to go.  Because I've been to Montreal.  I've been to Toronto.  I want to go to that Vancouver. 
[02:28:30]  Well, I'm in Alberta.  You guys don't have to be in the province.  Where the hell is that?  Alberta.  Yeah, that's Alberta.  You know where that is.  We only go to places.  It's up.  Without faggity girl names.  That's too far north.  You know the United States is taking a really good look at Vancouver.  We're going to take Vancouver.  You know that, right?  Well, I know.  I know.  We like Vancouver, and we're going to take it over eventually when we feel like it.  You guys can have it, because it's all Chinese.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, it is.  It's Hongcouver. 
[02:29:00]  Hongcouver.  Toronto and Montreal, the same.  Well, more Toronto than Montreal.  There's a lot of Asians in Toronto.  I don't know what's going on up there.  It's Montreal, Ope.  Not Montreal, you American.  It's Montreal.  It's Montreal.  I say Montreal.  Actually, it's Mont-le-er.  No, it's Montreal.  Mont-le-er.  Are you going to go to Montreal?  Alberta's problem is Indians and Filipinos.  Montreal.  Biggest problem?  Well, no, they're hard words.  Xenophobic animals up there.  All right, Lynette.  Yeah, we'll try to get to Western Connecticut. 
[02:29:30]  Jesus.  Western Canada.  Connecticut.  That's as far as we're going.  That's right.  We're going to go to Connecticut and go, whew, this is too far already.  All right.  Let's say hi to Will and PA, man.  PA.  Hey.  PA checking in.  Jimmy, you'll do me a favor and give me a ringtone of Shoot the Hostage.  That's Anthony.  That's Jim Laird.  Here's a ringtone.  Not even me.  Red Rum has her shower cam up and I want to jerk off on the floor.  That should be your ringtone. 
[02:30:00]  We're watching.  Fuck.  The ass on her.  Makes me angry.  She just looked at it.  I'm playing with my nipples.  Don't.  I pinch them sometimes while I sit here so no one can see.  She showers like every morning for Pal Talk.  It's a huge shower, too.  Well, only 1%.  We've got to stop talking.  Oh, yeah.  Don't talk about it.  No more naked girls showering.  Don't talk about that.  On camera.  Enough.  That's enough.  Let's go to Larry in Indiana.  Larry?  Boys.  Hi, Larry. 
[02:30:30]  Hi, Larry.  I am going to be making my first trip ever to New York the first full week of June, and  I want to make the walk, and I want to know where we should go to the studio, where it's  located.  Yeah, in front of the studio.  While we do the walk, you got a pen?  Yeah.  Meet us at, what, about 850 at 118th and Broadway.  Yep.  You got a pen? 
[02:31:00]  This isn't going to turn me up outside of one of Jimmy's, you know.  No, no, dude.  118th and Broadway, there's like a Popeye's fried chicken.  Right above that is the studio.  It's right on the corner of, if you're on 118th and Broadway at 850 in the morning, you'll  be there for the walk.  Okay.  All right.  Appreciate it.  When are you coming?  When are you coming, dude?  Do what?  When are you coming?  We are going to fly out June the 5th.  And I've got a weird thing. 
[02:31:30]  I know one of you guys at one time had talked about looking at a clock.  There was something about a clock.  When you would look at a clock, you would see a certain number.  Yeah, that would be me.  I have, I bet in the last year, every time I look at the clock, it is 9-11.  I'm looking at it right now, and it says five past asshole.  But even like this morning, I looked at the clock, it was 9-11. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, it's weird.  I'm looking at the clock.  It's never 9-20.  It's never 9-10.  Well, guess what?  Look at the clock right now.  I know.  It's 9-22, isn't it?  It just freaks me out.  Is this guy doing a Fezzy bit?  No, it was my 11th conversation I did on the Ron and Fez show.  All right.  Thank you, Larry.  Thanks.  118th and Broadway.  Okay, thanks.  Looking forward to seeing you.  Larry!  Okay.  By the way, I saw my ghost this morning. 
[02:32:30]  What?  You did?  Yeah.  He was on the couch smoking a cigarette.  No.  Ghosts don't smoke.  Your ghost is a douche.  Ghosts don't smoke.  I am to the point that I...  Where's a ghost going to get a cigarette?  I'll tell you what it was when you look closer.  Uh-huh.  See, because I'm not really seeing ghosts.  But for a split second, I think I am.  And it freaks me out so bad.  The hair on the back of my neck, as they say, is standing up.  And you should brush it, because it doesn't look good. 
[02:33:00]  Do you know now that I sleep downstairs?  Yeah, kind of creepy.  And I come upstairs every morning at 4.15-ish.  Right when the alarm goes off, I curse the world.  Yeah.  My first words every morning are, you've got to be fucking kidding me.  I swear to God, every morning.  Like clockwork.  The alarm goes off, and that's the first thing I say.  You've got to be fucking kidding me, right?  I concur.  Okay.  So then, you're just not awake.  We've talked about this. 
[02:33:30]  You're just not awake.  And I go upstairs, and I would look into the dark living room, and I see things every morning,  because my eyes aren't focused.  I'm acknowledging it.  Sorry.  Are we taping, E.T.?  Please say we are.  Richard Simmons is crying his eyes out over some fat, worthless lump of shit in a wheelchair.  That's Hebranco.  Is it?  What?  Is he back?  No way, that's Hebranco.  He's doing a little exercise, pulling something, do some, pull something down. 
[02:34:00]  Are we taping E.T.?  I hope E.T. is being taped, because he was just crying his faggoty eyes out.  Doesn't this guy put weight on, then lose it, then put it back on?  Dude, yes.  This is, if it is, if it's Hebranco, he's, just let him die.  Richard Simmons.  They did a whole fat special.  It's a little worse.  They did the half ton man or something on TLC, and they, it is Hebranco.  It's Hebranco.  Yes, die already.  Fuck him.  Dude, I'm not kidding. 
[02:34:30]  Do some, do a Google search on Michael Ebranco.  This is the third time, I believe, he went up to whatever he is, seven, eight hundred pounds.  He lost, he's an attention getter, and what he realizes, after he loses the weight, that the cameras go away, no one is interested, Richard Simmons doesn't return his calls, he likes the attention.  So he gets fat.  So he got fat again, because he was missing the attention, I'm telling you.  You have to see this TLC special, where they kind of featured him throughout the show a little bit, 
[02:35:00]  and they said, basically, that he's on his way back up to, you know, gaining all the weight back for the third time.  The third time.  How does someone like that live?  How is he alive?  Just let him go.  People don't want to face the addiction part of it.  They think getting the stomach stapling is enough, and I know it's hard, but I've watched people make choices.  I watch it, and I see what choices you're making, and look, I want to eat candy bars all the time, too. 
[02:35:30]  Believe me, I love Snickers.  Yummy.  I love Twix.  It's not about that with him, I'm telling you.  No, no, no, I'm not talking about him.  But I'm saying in general, I've watched the eating habits of people, and they don't want to make the right choice.  So it's like, stop expecting the rest of us to feel bad for you.  Yeah.  If I drink, and I drunk drive, and I hit a family, sure it's hilarious, but there is a price to pay with that.  Well, you know what?  You want to have a fucking salad, or do you want to eat a Twix bar?  I want a Twix bar, but I can't have one, so neither should I. 
[02:36:00]  He misses the attention.  I'm convinced of this.  I'm convinced.  He just misses the attention.  And look, he's back on TV.  Now he's back.  Now he's back.  He's crying.  Richard Simmons is crying again.  Let's say, hi to Craig in Jersey.  Craig.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Oh, man, I just wanted to make a quick comment.  You're saying every morning your alarm goes off like clockwork.  Isn't that a job?  Did you say that?  Yeah, I did.  Every morning, like clockwork, my alarm goes off.  It's a clock.  Crinkle, crinkle, Jimmy. 
[02:36:30]  God damn.  Thank you, fella.  We are retarded today.  I'm better than Yogi Berra.  No, we're not doing a show on Memorial Day, fuckers.  John in New York, what's up?  Yeah, you got to know, 118th and Broadway is the center of Columbia University.  It's like the nicest part of the Upper West Side.  See, I blew that, I blew that, too.  Yeah, but have him get out of there.  I even blew that bit.  I'm trying to find the worst part of Harlem, and I picked the best part.  One of the nicest.  You know what?  You're right. 
[02:37:00]  It is really nice up there.  I can't get anything right today.  I didn't pick it up either, though.  I seconded it.  It's a Popeye's chicken, but it's probably not a Popeye's chicken.  I have a pretzel in my mouth, but nobody notices.  No, we noticed.  So, you know.  So.  I'm not too fuck with us.  Because this has come up on the show.  Yeah.  So, I walk upstairs, and I'm not even awake 15 seconds, because I pop right out of bed.  Or, you know.  There's no reason to lay there at that point.  No.  You get up as quickly as possible.  Because I push it to the last minute anyway.  God forbid you fall asleep, and yet, wake up 10 minutes later. 
[02:37:30]  So, my eyes aren't focused.  I get to the top of the stairs.  I do a quick look around the living room, and I see stuff every morning.  And it's freaking me out.  We've talked about this.  And the hair stands up.  And everything.  I'm not kidding.  To the point where I just, I keep my eyes closed now.  I sound like the biggest wimp.  I understand that.  I walk up the stairs with my eyes closed, feeling around for the lights to turn them on.  Because I don't want to see anything anymore.  But today, I'm like, ah, you're such a baby.  Just look. 
[02:38:00]  So, I got to the top of the stairs.  I play this game with myself every morning.  I get to the top of the stairs, and I look at the couch.  There's a guy sitting there smoking a cigarette.  That's what I saw.  Then I turn the lights on.  And what it is, is my MiFi is on the windowsill.  And there's a battery light that's red.  That's the cigarette.  That's the cigarette.  And then there was...  And what's the guy?  A stupid, like, you know, couch pillow was up on the back of the couch.  So, that looked kind of like a head.  And then I have, like, a blanket on my couch for Sundays.  You know, the deal. 
[02:38:30]  And that was, like, kind of draped.  That looked like the whole body.  But every morning...  It got to the point, before I go to bed, I, like, adjust things.  You got to readjust everything.  I adjust things in the room, going, well, that could look like an old lady right there.  I got to make sure that's not happening.  You want to set a mannequin there.  It'll probably look like a blanket.  Put a mannequin there with a knife in its hand.  You're like, oh, it's just my mannequin.  Right.  Blanket.  An afghan.  But, once again, just completely freaked out.  Completely.  Yeah, I got monsters outside the house that I see every morning when I take a leak. 
[02:39:00]  Because there's a window right above the toilet.  And I don't like flipping the lights on because my pupils will slam shut.  So, I just kind of have a very dim light on in the bathroom while I'm taking a leak.  So, I can see outside.  By the way, that'll wake you up, too.  Really?  Why?  You're supposed to have very dim lights if you're going to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  So, you can get back to sleep.  Yeah, so you can get back to sleep.  But, yeah, I'm trying to wake up here.  But, I just don't want the initial light, you know?  So, I'm looking out the window.  And now, since it's not light on in the bathroom, I can see outside, even though it's pitch black out. 
[02:39:30]  And I see things moving amongst the bushes and stuff.  And it's totally your eyes playing tricks on you.  It's just too early.  It's in your imagination.  But, there's things outside.  Spooks.  I had a weird thing happen.  I woke up this morning.  And I knew I was kind of like a few minutes after I wanted to.  And I looked at the alarm clock.  And it looked like a clock.  What would that be?  5.40?  No, no, no.  5.16.  5.40.  And then I looked at my dresser. 
[02:40:00]  And I saw a dresser.  You couple of girls.  I'm never nervous when I wake up.  There's no such thing as ghosts.  The two of you should fucking grow cocks and cut it out.  It's not so much that I think there are ghosts.  It's that you're startled by seeing something.  I'm never startled.  It's my room.  How would you not startle?  I see a plant.  There it is.  Because you don't have all your wits about you at that time of the morning.  I'm always witty.  Simple.  I am a simple boy. 
[02:40:30]  You are simple with no imagination.  There's a ghost.  I just talk to it because I think it's a tree.  I'm never scared of nothing.  Even the black man coming in the window.  I asked him if he wanted me to wash an apple for him.  Weston, Washington.  Yeah, I was wondering if I could get...  No, you can't.  What?  First of all, you're the greatest.  Your laugh when Jimmy did the plug joke was just the greatest. 
[02:41:00]  And I was wondering if I could get that or your other one as a ringtone.  What joke, though?  The, uh...  Yeah, do you have anything to plug with the guy with the bad hair plugs?  Oh, that was a good one.  Okay, sir.  What do you want?  You know what would be a good ringtone is Steve's laugh at the end of the intro?  That would be a great one.  That big laugh he has at the end.  At my really, really funny joke in that studio.  By the way, my ringtone is Ben's snoring. 
[02:41:30]  Rave reviews, man.  People must hate it.  Rave reviews.  And then when I get a voicemail, it's the hybrid car coming in.  It works perfectly.  Ooh.  It works perfectly to alert you of a voicemail.  Well, I asked Danny to help me load them onto my phone, and Danny didn't know how to do it.  So is there anybody around here with a set of balls that could help me out?  Maybe a fan?  Danny is a blithering idiot.  Danny is as dumb as they come.  By the way, Wes, I will not laugh for you. 
[02:42:00]  I will.  Oh, come.  I will.  Jimmy will.  Because some people, a lot of people out there don't like my laugh, I've discovered.  I'm such an ass, because you know what?  I finally decided to check out some of the fan sites.  I'm like, you know what?  It's been a while.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  I'm going to check out some of the fan sites out there.  Yeah.  You know, I do peek at Wackbag from time to time, and then I'm like, let me see what 
[02:42:30]  all the other websites are about.  And so I go to, why isn't it loading?  Their site's not loading.  Their site's not loading, because they know I'm going to trash them.  No, that's not how you spell it.  Anthony, you silly goose.  It's not loading.  It's not loading.  Well, now I can't do what I want to say.  Oh, well.  Well, I go to opianthony.net, and I'm like, ah, let me see what's going on.  And the first thread, anyone else sick of Opie's fake laugh? 
[02:43:00]  I'm like, goodbye.  Goodbye.  Couldn't tell you.  Goodbye.  Couldn't tell you what's on there.  I wasn't even going to click on the thread.  Thank you.  I gave it a shot, and look what happened.  Goodbye.  I don't know this site.  I don't know what it does.  I don't go there.  Well, I tried, and stupid me, I got, you know. 
[02:43:30]  That's what you, you just don't go.  The same 20 people knocking around the same bullshit, and leave that alone.  Have fun.  I will say one thing about .NET.  I've had my problems with them.  But they have been, of the new show, more supportive than anybody.  Of the new version of the show, of the terrestrial version, of all the sites.  Yeah.  It was surprising that that's been the site that has actually had the most praise for it.  Well, they have no problem.  Whatever.  Let's go to Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred, what's up? 
[02:44:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing?  How you doing, Fred?  Thanks for calling in.  Going back to your previous topic about seeing things in the middle of the morning or night,  we install a lot of lighting systems for people who claim to see things.  So, in other words, they wake up to the same problem you have, Opie.  So, you can turn on your lights from downstairs, you know, to upstairs just by pushing buttons,  and you never have to worry about it.  You can turn on dim.  You don't see things when you wake up.  There is a light switch at the bottom of the stairs, but that controls the light that went out about two years ago, 
[02:44:30]  and I haven't changed it.  Wow.  Isn't it amazing how long you can leave a bulb out?  Hold on, mister.  I had one go out about three months ago, and I now just walk through the room to the back and use my hand for the other one.  Why won't I change the bulb?  I haven't changed it in well over two years.  Let's have a bulb-changing party, Opie.  You change my bulbs, and I'll change yours.  And I know this happens every morning, so there's the solution.  There's a light that I can turn on at the bottom of the stairs. 
[02:45:00]  Turn it on.  And I still haven't changed that light bulb.  Changed the bulb.  I had almost every bulb blown out in the house I moved out of.  I think that's why I moved.  I had none left.  Every time I turn the light on, boom, done.  That one's gone, and I wouldn't go out and buy a new one.  You take one from a less used area of the house until there's none of those left,  and you're just walking around like an idiot in the dark.  Right.  Two lights.  Hey, go ahead.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  I'm selling a couple of lamps that I want to get rid of.  I'm going to put photos of them on eBay. 
[02:45:30]  No, they're nice ones.  One of them is a little too weird.  No, they're not.  Stop it.  What kind of lamps do you own?  One is like a $200 modern-looking lamp.  Is it a stand-up-in-the-corner kind of lamp?  Yeah.  Or a table lamp?  No, no, no.  Stand-up-in-the-corner.  Yeah?  But I got another one now that I like better.  So I want to sell the old one.  And I have another one from Pottery Barn that I bought years ago.  Hey, can I go to Jake in Maine?  Hi, good.  Jake.  Hello.  Hey, Jake.  Howdy, Jake.  This is the point I'm trying to make, by the way.  Go ahead, Jake. 
[02:46:00]  It's ridiculous.  The Whack Bag guys, all they do is just trash.  Well, no.  And Jay Moore goes on there, and they're trashing Moore, and Moore just ripped them apart.  I haven't been on there since I saw Moore just ripped them all up there.  I'm not going after Whack Bag, believe it or not.  No.  I frequent Whack Bag, and I think they do a fine job over there.  I have no problem with Whack Bag.  Hold on.  The point Jake was going to make was very simple, and this is what I agree with.  There's supposed to be fan sites, but all they do is complain.  Like, that's what I don't get.  There's enough people out there that hate our fucking show, and they're posting on Stern's message boards, 
[02:46:30]  and this group and that group that we don't even know about.  They're not fans of the show.  They hate us.  Yeah, who cares?  So they'll go out, and they'll trash the show.  But then there's fan sites that we were supporting and stuff.  They're not fan sites if most of the posts are trashing the show.  And listen, and this is the thing.  It's not that you can't trash the show when it legit.  Look, there are times we know we stink, and this bit's not good.  And you can read legitimate criticism and go, eh. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, that's one thing.  I don't get pissed off if I read legitimate criticism.  If I know it's coming from a place of somebody who digs the show and who isn't just shitting on the show,  I really don't get pissed off.  And I actually do analyze what they write, and there are times when they make it.  They listen more than anybody.  There's times when they're right.  But when a fan site becomes so much more negative than positive, it's no longer a fan site.  And then people go, oh, that means you just can't take it.  No, we just have realized this isn't a fan site anymore.  Not a fan site.  Why the hell are we going to promote it? 
[02:47:30]  So continue and have fun.  And what show points out when they're awful faster than we do?  What show allows you to point it out to us on the air faster than this show?  I mean, it's not like we can't take the criticism.  We don't dump out a cause of the Baba Booey calls.  Are you sorry?  Go ahead.  It's not that.  It's when they get on and just start like with the bashing of roles on the show, what we do on the show, the show structure, things like that.  That gets like, you know something, shut the fuck up. 
[02:48:00]  Come in here one day and you organize this circus, asshole.  Let's see how good you are at it.  You'll see what this is all about.  Again, on Tough Crowd one time, there was people on the Comedy Central message board that would trash the show.  Oh, yeah.  We sent, I forget someone of our producers sent out a bunch, a bunch of emails to all the people that were trashing the show.  Only three responded and only one came in.  Colin gave them an open invitation.  Read your post on the show.  You won't be attacked. 
[02:48:30]  Read your post on the show in front of the camera.  How did I miss that?  One guy showed up.  And what happened?  He read it.  Beat him up?  But he was not, he was nervous.  He wound up realizing that we were nice guys.  Oh, he was terrified.  Nervous Nelly.  Terrified.  It's easy.  Come on.  You just get up there and do it.  Yeah, and plus, like, again, it's like, you know, again, you're always welcome to your opinion, but just express it like a man.  Express it like the same way we have to express what we do.  Express it like a man.  Exactly.  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know, I just prefer the FDA just because 75% of the posts I go on on the boards are just all the negative or trashing on your guys' regulars and stuff like that.  I mean, if you're friends with the show, why are you going to spend your time trashing on them?  No matter how good a board is, there are always going to be a certain amount of assholes on it.  It's just the nature of the beast.  But the thing is, you want it to be a larger percentage of people that are kind of enjoying the show and talking about it in a positive light than bashing it. 
[02:49:30]  And the second they're bashing it more than they're liking it, bye-bye.  And you could tell what their agenda is.  Like, I watched, they were trashing Bam one time on one of the boards for something he did with, like, bringing Lady Diane or something.  And it was almost like, how can you trash the guy for helping out the show?  Well, he doesn't have a job.  He doesn't have a life.  You're on the message board all day.  What's the difference between that and him bringing Lady Diane, which helped us with a great bit?  Like, how can you trash that?  And, like, it's almost like they trash things just because someone calls himself a pastor. 
[02:50:00]  It's like, dude, what the fuck are you doing?  The guy helped us out.  They actually trashed Bam for bringing Lady Diane on the show.  It's like, Jesus Christ.  It was gold having that waste, that waste of humanity on our program.  And yet the same people go back over and go, dude, remember that time when Psycho Mark knocked a reporter over?  It was great.  Oh, I see.  That was great.  And when he got booted for having an ass-fucking on the couch, that was great.  Yeah.  Maybe it's because you were in a different place when the NEW show was on, so you have a different connection to that show. 
[02:50:30]  Like, why is that okay, yet No Filter Paul, who asterisk here, is an ass?  Complete and total.  But why is that different than No Filter Paul running out and going, blah, blah, blah, blah?  Oh, my God.  Speaking of No Filter Paul, I was going to address this personally and maybe give him a phone call.  Oh, I thought you were going to say he was dead and I was going to be happy, but I might as well.  It's just as easy to do it this way.  Of course.  He has a phone call or to everybody that's listening. 
[02:51:00]  Paul.  Oh, no.  I don't know if I still have the email.  The answer is I do not want to go out and have sushi with you and your wife.  Oh, boy.  What do you mean, Ope?  He's just trying to put himself out there, maybe start a relationship.  Somewhere he thought, like, I don't know, he was feeling good that there might actually be a blooming relationship.  I literally have four friends in life, and you're not going to become number five. 
[02:51:30]  I don't want to have sushi with you.  Four friends barely hanging on.  Four friends clinging by their fingernails.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe I was nice to him for once, and he was feeling something, and he thought, well, this is a good opportunity.  I should see if he wants to socialize outside the environment of the show.  You don't even have to be nice to him.  You just have to not be despicable towards him.  He was starting a new job, so he figured it would be, you know, maybe we could get together, you know, have a sushi date. 
[02:52:00]  You know, me and my lady and him and his girl, wife.  I like Denise and I like Paul.  And so he figured before he starts the new job, you know, it would be a great opportunity to have sushi.  Paul, stop.  Wait, what?  You're embarrassing yourself.  I didn't even answer your email.  What's the email, Ope?  I think that maybe there's a harsh reaction here. 
[02:52:30]  Let's read that email.  Well, if I could get an XM Tech to maybe find where it goes after you delete it, I can read it to you in the trash section.  You deleted it, Opie?  Of course I did.  We were watching it as I saw it.  Me and my girlfriend were watching a movie, and there was a...  And it made me laugh.  My girlfriend and I.  Yes, my girlfriend and I were watching a movie, and there was some English guy in the movie,  and he kind of talked like no-filter Paul.  And my girlfriend says, she goes, how come it's kind of cute when anyone else has that accent except Paul? 
[02:53:00]  It's just annoying.  Because when Paul talks, you can picture his face and awful hairdo.  Paul, your hairdo is enraging us.  That's the problem with no-filter Paul.  It's the fact that he kind of has a shrunken head face, and his hairdo...  Honest, I've never seen more Lego person hair than you have.  It's the type of hairdo that makes me want to hammer your face.  And the gut... 
[02:53:30]  I was going to go with Weeble hair.  Weeble hair would work, too.  Yeah, Weeble.  Weeble hair works fine.  The gut is awful, Paul.  It is gigantic.  Above the waist, you sicken everyone.  Paul, no sushi for you.  You will not be going.  But he thought...  No, but maybe he thought, like, you guys probably talked one time, and you probably thanked him  for something and said, hey, great job.  But he probably figured the four of you would get together and have sushi.  Maybe he'd pick up the check, or you'd pick up the check, and you'd talk about the new  job and the opportunities.  Well, we had to exchange phone numbers in Atlantic City, and I gave him the wrong number, 
[02:54:00]  and he didn't get the hint there.  Yeah, he got back and wound up getting your number somehow, huh?  No, he never got my phone number.  Oh, he got your email?  Yeah.  But at Atlantic City, he's like, hey, he has his phone out all awkwardly, like, what's  your number?  I want to call you sometime, and maybe we could have sushi or go out to dinner.  And I'm like, uh, five?  Uh.  Five, five, five.  Do you know...  Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine, two. 
[02:54:30]  That was, by the way, him gearing up the courage.  That was like talking to a hot chick, you're going to wait for the right moment.  You probably gave him the right body language, and he felt this is the opportunity.  Let's go out for sushi.  We'll go out and have some laughs.  I'll go out with you.  Let's go to Steve.  With you, with me, with my wife.  We'll go out at 3.30.  3.30 sounds good.  Let's go to Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve.  Hey, are Paul and his wife swingers?  Are they swingers? 
[02:55:00]  Not to my knowledge.  Didn't they say that, I thought they said on the radio show that they're swingers once.  The only way I want to see them as swingers is from the end of a rope.  Strange fruit.  Strange, strange fruit.  I wish they were, though.  Here's the question I got.  If they're swingers, what do I get?  What's in it for me?  What's in it for me?  I'll bet two mouths on your cock.  I bet you they fight over it.  I bet you she's working on it and he goes, come on, let me, come on, let me have that. 
[02:55:30]  Real loud.  Please.  I hope you'd be trading a Ferrari for a Rambler.  What the hell do you want to go swinging for?  No, thank you.  She's working the tip and then fucking Paul's on the balls looking under the bag and you  can feel his beard tickle.  And he's like talking, they're like talking to each other.  I bet you, I bet you he sucks it sloppier and wetter than she does.  I bet you he's like, come on, you get the balls.  He gets mad at her because he thinks she's not doing it right. 
[02:56:00]  Get to the balls, I'll do the top.  And then he gets really wet.  Probably makes that noise.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm trying to talk to Ope, I'm straightening him out.  So no more emails.  Disgusting, mate.  There will be no sushi for you.  Denise probably uses more teeth and then Paul, yeah, is all lips.  He's all lips, that kid.  And he pulls it out and he runs those juicy lips over the back like he's playing a harmonica.  He has two juicy lips and his tongue.  She'll work the balls because he yells at her when she doesn't get sloppy enough on the 
[02:56:30]  cock.  Work the balls.  Yeah.  He probably tries to look up and make eye contact with you because it's more than just  a suck job.  There's actually a little love involved, but he knows you won't look at him.  He's used to a guy just putting a hand on his head.  Holy shit.  I'm just speculating.  Oh, God, is that horrid.  Why?  It's called no filter because he wants you to raw dog fuck him.  He wants you to fuck him out of bag.  Skin on skin. 
[02:57:00]  Nothing protecting us.  Well, you can ask him if you want.  Why did E-Rock just send an...  E-Rock, what are you doing?  What are you doing, E-Rock?  Oh, no.  What do E-Rock do, Ope?  E-Rock, to...  What did you do?  To Don Wicklin, CC Greg Hughes from E-Rock, subject, Ope's login password.  What is wrong with you?  E-Rock?  I'm trying to get the email for him.  Do you happen to know where we could get Ope's login password looking to retrieve an email  he deleted off his BlackBerry?  Eric. 
[02:57:30]  Don Wicklin.  Oh, boy.  It should be the same password as the login for his laptop.  I bring nothing to the table.  Well, I don't want people knowing my logins.  I bring nothing to the table.  E-Rock maybe was trying to help the bit because you didn't...  Do you know what?  I have to side with E-Rock.  I...  Why?  Because he's a sweetie.  We didn't need to read the email.  You know what?  You're hurting his feelings.  Is this on?  Paul.  Is this on?  Paul.  Paul.  Paul.  Hey, Paul.  Can we straighten this out, Paul?  Just hold one second, darling.  Because I think E-Rock's feelings are hurt, and I think we all know what needs to be done 
[02:58:00]  here.  I want everyone in a good mood, Ope.  I want...  This is a positive Monday.  All right.  Let's do this right.  It's automatic Monday.  It's...  No, I had the Mondays today.  And shake the goddamn box right.  Shake it right.  Just like Jimmy does.  Or we'll slap you.  Good shit.  It's getting better.  It's not bad.  A little slow, but...  There's not enough lift, like...  Oh, my...  This sucks.  I don't have three.  Yours wasn't good today.  No, I only have three sentiments.  Thanks to Than not doing his job.  Fire him.  Now, read your sentiment. 
[02:58:30]  Smile, and the world smiles with you.  Die of AIDS, and they'll smile even more.  There you go.  That's a nice sentiment.  An E-Rock tender sentiment.  Atta boy, Eric.  Atta boy.  Paul.  Yes.  Hi, Paul.  On what planet did you think I was going to go have sushi with you?  I don't know.  I just told for one second you were a normal human being, but I was thrown off.  When did you ask him, Paul?  Yeah, and what was the atmosphere, the mood?  Why did you think that moment was the moment to ask, as opposed to any other time when you 
[02:59:00]  knew he would say no?  After RCS, he said, email me, and I'll let you know.  And that was the end of the conversation.  Email me, and I'll let you know.  He asked me, I forgot, he asked me live, and I go, well, you know what, because believe  it or not, when the mics are off, I'm a nicer guy.  Yeah, I know that.  I'm not a nice guy, but I'm a nicer guy.  So, there were, like, listeners all around, and Paul's asking me if, you know, Lindsey  and I would like to go to sushi with his wife and Denise in front of all these fans, and 
[02:59:30]  I'm like, ah, why don't you just email me, and I'll let you know.  Like, I had to ask Lindsey.  I didn't have to ask anyone, Paul.  I was just trying to save your feelings.  Well, wait a minute now, Paul.  What did you say?  How did you actually ask?  I said, would you, I got to join me and my wife for sushi, because I know you like  that, and my wife likes sushi.  That was it.  When did you want to do it?  Does it really matter now?  I'm actually curious.  Any evening?  I don't make enough money to feed your bellies.  I don't need you to feed me. 
[03:00:00]  I can afford it myself.  Were you going to treat Opie, were you going to treat Opie to sushi?  I don't know why I want to after this.  Well, I mean, because I think that maybe you just didn't ask right or something.  Who knows?  I mean, it's awkward sometimes.  I've had sushi with Paul.  Paul, have you had it go?  It was good.  I went too, because Jimmy wanted to introduce me to No Filter Paul.  And that was the last time I decided I'd ever eat with No Filter Paul.  Oh, that was when he was being really inappropriate.  Yeah, racist in a sushi restaurant.  The only black person in the place.  See, the problem is, Paul, that you're just a little loud, I think, and it was like, 
[03:00:30]  it's because that's why you have your nickname.  But sometimes you'll talk and say, I'm a fucking cunt!  While people are in a restaurant, and it's a little embarrassing.  I think that might be the problem.  Dropping N-bombs all over the place.  Yeah.  Well, Anthony can confirm that I can actually be a normal person in a private sitting sitting.  When?  When we went to a French restaurant.  What, Frenchie's restaurant?  No, no, no, the one behind the hotel.  What French restaurant?  Oh, the one by the Parker Meridian. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, we had to tell you to be quiet a couple of times.  I missed that.  E-Rock was there for that one, right?  Remember that, E-Rock?  And Paul would kind of a couple of times, and then if it wasn't you, it was your wife.  What'd she do?  She was being all loud and inappropriate.  I have no control over that.  Yeah.  You've got to smack her in the head.  Yeah, sometimes in a restaurant, you just have to be, like, mellow.  Like, just kind of relaxed and eat and talk softly.  How was it?  I don't know.  I was under the mistaken impression Ope would give me another chance, but I guess I needed 
[03:01:30]  I think if you work at Ope, Will, I know Ope well enough to know that he's a softy deep  down.  You've got to work a little bit more, I think, more emails.  Shut up, Timmy.  I'm trying to help you about that.  Shut up.  I think a blooming friendship is here.  Shut up.  Oh, shit.  Uh-oh.  What's happening over there?  Now you guys are in trouble.  Why is she cursing?  Why is she cursing?  Why is she cursing?  Did you talk a bit about smacking her in the head?  No.  What bit about smacking her in the head?  She gets lippy.  Yeah.  What bit about smacking her in the head? 
[03:02:00]  What bit?  Hold on.  Three.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Now I've got to talk to her.  Please.  Jesus.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello? 
[03:02:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  She hasn't figured out.  You guys are playing a silent game on her.  Hello?  Hello?

[03:08:00]  careful though no i know how to grab my fucking taint i can never describe it but i know how to do it  pinch pull pinch pull what were we doing before we uh went to uh a break richard simmons  richard simmons michael obranco yes we uh caught it quickly it was on et how much did we get  uh this is off the internet unfortunately we're it's on et tonight so can we tape it guys we'll tape 
[03:08:30]  to richard simmons what who it's where what there's 50 hand signals going on i don't know ben talking  about something else ben was yes ben ben was bringing in a plane he's always bad when he  drives everyone thinks he's signaling lighter i don't know what that mean i think it means you're  going to drive straight up in the air and then plummet left that's just like lighting a lighter and  everyone's facing the other with that fucking hairdo i can't still figure out what ben besides chucky i 
[03:09:00]  can't figure out what that hairdo is that hairdo it reminds me of somebody it reminds me of somebody  and i don't know who who does that buffon yes by the way and for the last 10 minutes poe has been  trying to explain to me that he had every serious intention of doing security a happy typing girls  pout box slumber party well he pulled mars aside saying that he was he didn't you know he was he was  well-intentioned no you weren't you wanted to stand there with your dick hard in your panties 
[03:09:30]  i don't blame you poe i don't blame you well intentioned poe on the radio again well intentioned  sir oh my god i i meant well when i this should be terrific i think i think we should get to the  bottom of this once and for all all right guys i really don't want to take the funny out of this but  uh in all seriousness yeah i know it's difficult for me to do that i sincerely wanted to defend or  protect these women i've had quite a few instances where women have come up to me and they were 
[03:10:00]  raped and they were beaten by their husbands in a closed place where they're having a  party everywhere i mean like yeah there's plenty of girls there there's like the only time that  happens is is like we were talking about when a serial killer burr busts in and starts putting  their heads in windows and if it was stalker patty they'd all applaud it's not like it was just  gonna be happy typing girl and lucci on the side of the highway bent over a cone with their asses  sticking up in the air it's gonna be a bunch of people in a room that's next week i'm a guy i 
[03:10:30]  know what the thing is you want to stand there not that you want to fuck them all at that time but you  know all those chicks bunch of liquor somebody yeah you just wanted to be there something may happen  but not in the security i've never seen more people typing out h-a-a-a and l-o-l more in my life  no one's buying it no one no not that you wouldn't protect them or not that you didn't care about  it was an undisclosed location but there is that ulterior male motive and poe is an alpha male 
[03:11:00]  so if i have those motives he certainly does because he's a man's man likes to  fucking fight that's what poe does he fucks and he fights he wrecks pussy he wrecks pussy and if he  can't do it his dick he punches it and he fucking karate kicks it and puts his two little fingers  in the lip and hooks it and yanks around the room that's why i like him all right paul thank you  gentlemen laughing my ass off ha ha ha ha ha ha poe's a pimp please uh had a lot of women get raved 
[03:11:30]  him i i know that but usually when there's 30 chicks in a room yeah it doesn't happen they could  pretty much take care of them what one guy is gonna hold a girl down and fuck her while 28 more just  sit there and watch and go we better do something 20 more adjust the camera yeah so the rest of pal  talk and see that probably is what they would do if there was a rape going on they'd fix the cameras  first call police second fan all right how you doing buddy boy great um yep what why was that oh yeah

[03:39:00]  got to breathe while you do this you can't hold your breath in his body is breaking down  his kidneys his heart  i pray he makes michael could die in his sleep at any time i forget to breathe why you see we  can't forget to breathe i could have ended up this way you know i was almost 300 pounds on my way up 
[03:39:30]  i could have ended up housebound i could have ended up dying alone in the bed  what a dramatic ass over dramatic and yeah it had to go back to him you know i could have been  here i was almost 300 pounds he was what 290 at the most yeah that's pretty fat but it's no 800 pound 
[03:40:00]  fucking behemoth i gotta stick up they gotta take a forklift out uh to get you out of the house  the difference between richard and tyra though is at least i mean we all know richard isn't an  ass and whatever faggot oh believe me there's not a cock out there that he wouldn't wink at and at  least want to talk to but the guy is an ex-overweight person and he's helped a lot of people i don't  give you fucking awful outfits and his mediocre body he looks like fucking hawk without without  clothes that's exactly who he looks like he's not fat and yet is not taking that as a compliment 
[03:40:30]  eric is not a fat guy and yet his body is somehow slug-like and revolting i mean no offense  that's at least richard simmons you know is coming from that place and he's helped a lot of  people iraq has the weight iraq looks terrific from you know iraq has lost weight has he who is he  helped who is he fucking help who i don't know name i don't talk i see infomercials where he gets  these fatties sarah jones to do to do the sweating to the oldies for enough time to film the commercial 
[03:41:00]  and that's all i see with the awareness about it and he's done a lot i i have to deal a meal  where you deal cards to fucking eat his stupid milo calculator thing where you punch you sit there  and punch and i had peas and you look at numbers that pop out and tells you uh by uh 9 a.m you've  you've eaten all you can eat all day well for us that's silly but it is silly for anybody on this  planet if you're a heavy-set gentleman fatties fatties like jimmy said salad put the cookies down 
[03:41:30]  you're gonna lose weight the end i've watched people do it i've watched them eat horrendous food  even after a stomach stapling and it's like what are you doing richard simmons is capitalizing on  people's uh compulsion to eat well he is coming out with these inventions  and deal a meal that he he lost any respect he might have had as far as getting fat people thin 
[03:42:00]  when he came out with something called a deal a meal well i have a broccoli card and i have a a chicken  card and now you put those on the other side of your wallet and and you're fine now you've eaten uh  those portions of the day he's exploiting fat people but what isn't what isn't exploiting  something i mean with the exception of the sincerity of just wanting to help mother theresa okay 
[03:42:30]  she is the perfect human there are 12-step programs you have you know narcotics anonymous alcoholics  anonymous uh uh uh overeaters anonymous those programs exploit nobody because they're all all privately  funded by the members and those are completely um non-exploited richard simmons lives in a  mansion because he's exploited fat people aside from those 12-step programs which are free yeah  rehabs help a lot of people man they save lives they are exploiting you and making money i mean if 
[03:43:00]  you want to look at it that way doctors are exploiting your illness and making money on it i mean everyone  is is got their own angle fixing it i mean i'm exploiting drug addiction when i get girls to suck my  dick for a few bucks and thank god for crack and heroin look at that stupid thing it looks like a lotto  scratch card of food oh i could eat a bean get out of here uh michael hebranco be helped by richard  simmons without the cameras rolling i agree yeah i find michael hebranco to be repulsive because he put 
[03:43:30]  it all back on when he had a choice and he just didn't want to deal with the symptoms what made him  fucked up and that's why he put the weight back on you don't deal with who you are and what your  flaws are you finish let's go to mike in jersey mike hey guys hey there mike hey yeah you know what i  hate the richard simmons too but you know what i think he might be a faggot well don't go speculating  like that i just wonder why he's uh doing a lame impersonation of joaquin phoenix he could die right 
[03:44:00]  now he can die tomorrow tomorrow car crash i don't hate richard simmons he's just that silly  how do you hate richard simmons he's harmless he's just a you know he's what was he singing baby come  to me oh that's fact i should be singing that to a coffin and was he standing in front of the fat  guy baby come to me like asking him to walk to him yes and jack black threw some fucking some some  some bottle of the big fat guy's face and it had like uh nitrous what what they should hey no i'm

[03:53:30]  all right hey uh what's what's going on with bodog.net there's like a poll every week or something  going on a poll online online poll and what what we're what the we can bet we can now uh  wager but on anything that happens in here and get results you know how people like getting involved  in the program opie you know how we bet on a lot of things in here yeah twitchels is in we bet how  many seconds he's gonna be able to shut up things like that and the audience always wants to get 
[03:54:00]  involved when now they're going to be able to get involved through bodog do they win something  they're going to be able to get involved through bodog right where they win steve i don't know yet  we have no idea we don't know but it's going to be a place where they can go and instantly like we'll  be able to put up right a uh a poll place where they can actually uh you know make these uh all  right well we got to get the wagers we got to get creative then because the poll questions stink  oh are they ones that are written for us they usually like giving us an outline 
[03:54:30]  this poll one pest poll two pest poll three number one which member of the ona show will  get dumped out the most this week opie anthony jim norton some potty mouth guest  pest poll two how many hours a day do you listen to ona less than an hour one to three hours three  to six hours that's a goofy one and then finally what is your favorite recreational beverage  what beer wine bring on the hard stuff i want that poll removed immediately i don't know okay 
[03:55:00]  i just got to put something up in its place what was the question what's your favorite beverage  recreational beverage is urine up there yeah jimmy's not going to be able to  liquid popcorn  does it really taste like popcorn depends on what she drinks there's times where piss can be pretty um  um kind of non-flavored uh and then there's times where it's really strong and salty can you believe  he actually does this it's a little too salty for me yeah i want to read that book who wrote that 
[03:55:30]  it's an interesting book about black uh culture and entertainment which is called black like you  and there's a white man it looks like in blackface on the cover and it starts off talking about a protest  for shirley q liquor it's a white guy who does a black character a black female character um and as  a tranny he plays or some shit and of course they were protesting because they're saying it's  misogynistic and racist you know all right it is yeah why don't we play our last thing here and we'll  get out of here for the day what will we go the columbine video game oh yeah another oh god enough 
[03:56:00]  already i i could i could even understand this is like a real tasteless sure subject matter for a game i  think it's a guy trying to be sensational and well we got to play the news story so get a little  outline get everybody get everyone up to speed and then we'll get into this a little bit i was doing  it backwards i'm sorry you've probably seen violent video games before but not like this this one's  based on a real-life massacre and you don't even have to go to a video store to buy it it's available 
[03:56:30]  free on the internet it's called super columbine massacre rpg and it's based on the columbine high  school killings in april of 1999 players can choose to be one of the two gunmen and can actually  take out figures representing the real victims in the tragedy that took 15 lives and injured many  others my first reaction about this columbine game is absolute horror because we already lived through  this in america with all of these uh children being killed in the game which has gained notoriety 
[03:57:00]  through blogs the cartoon-like renderings of the actual places where students are slaughtered  are side by side with photos of the real thing so there's a game out there that's they should  find him whoever made that is just a scumbag yeah that's somebody just trying to uh get some publicity  for this because i'll tell you something and and if there was any work put into this game where it  was actually uh a legitimate kind of a game that was maybe entertaining or something i might even have 
[03:57:30]  some different i i saw what this game is it looks like it has like maris mess super mario brothers  you say like 1982 video graphics video graphics it's not even yeah it's done with this overhead view  kind of uh all pixelated big chunky characters it's uh very cheaply made some kid made this game  and he was incognito and a few people found it no i mean i and in all honesty obviously harsh and 
[03:58:00]  all that but no real big deal no because no one knew about no one knew about it and people like no  big deal oh my god well let me explain now the news grabbed this story is running with it so now  everyone is going to check out the game and what does the news think that they're going to report  this stuff in and we're not curious curious enough to check it out ourselves yeah like they're making  more people aware of this thing that would have probably went away in a week or two yeah it's a  non-story it's really a non-story there is unfortunately uh crap like this out there all 
[03:58:30]  over the internet the game looks like it stinks but this game is being like uh googled like crazy now  today people are like trying to find this thing because they're now curious yeah they're going to  download it like crazy now the page is going to get hit like uh unbelievable because the news brought  it up the news brought it up just because they needed something sensational and then they feel  they're going to lump this in now with violent video games like now anytime you hear a politician  go we got to get rid of there's games out there about columbine and this one and then uh lump in 
[03:59:00]  legitimate fun entertaining games that have a violent uh storyline with this and then they go before  congress and they hear columbine oh well we gotta ban all of these and then you wind up not being  able to play a good game well we got the people on the street segment listen to this yeah it's terrible  must make them feel terrible and probably just encourages more violence if it were my family  where i had one of my loved ones to be killed i would not want to be reminded daily it's appalling 
[03:59:30]  it's disgusting they shouldn't allow it and of course there are photos of the two killers eric harris  and dylan klebold along with running commentary almost like a cartoon just too dangerous  for all of the kids out there who may be seeing it and for memories that it brings back for so many  others the video game creator insists he's not advocating shooting up schools no matter how many  times he says it he says no one is listening his point that if you go far enough into the game eric  harris and dylan klebold both end up dead oh okay how about giving out his real name yeah why are you 
[04:00:00]  protecting his real name give his name out and uh see this is where people go wrong it is disgusting  and it is revolting and i hope i i think it'd be funny if somebody shot him i would never encourage  people to do that but i think it'd be funny and ironic yet you can't say it shouldn't be allowed yes  it should be yeah that's the price you pay for free speech it should be and it it is i mean i don't 
[04:00:30]  think there's anything they can do about it they can't take it off the the net you could get people  you know that host the the website to not put it on there but it's already out there it's there  there's no taking it back once it gets on the internet so and it's it's just it looks so bad  it doesn't even look entertaining if it was a first person shooter or something you know fun like that  i like the fact that anthony's take on it you know the columbine massacre i know i saw that game 
[04:01:00]  graphics are terrible the graphics were awful anthony's a gamer i saw the game the graphics 1985  i star raiders from atari i was expecting to see something that looked like grand theft auto  yeah and it looked like frogger or something yeah  remember hubert wasn't he adorable no he was awful frogger did i tell you that in high school  you uh set the record for playing asteroid no it wasn't a record no you were nine and that was i 
[04:01:30]  was 13 13 and you set the record for how long you played no it wasn't a record i just played for 10  hours but when i was a boy i was voted sweetest boy in town i know you i was what kind of town did you  live in where they even had something like that i won a lot of awards i also won boy voted most likely  to brighten your day you are such a liar you're fibbing sweetest boy in town sweetest boy in town 
[04:02:00]  third year in a row goes to and i would just stand up award giving in in the gazebo in town square  yes it was and there were flower arrangements and they said and the award for boy most likely to  brighten your day and i would just stand up and start walking for my award because you knew  everyone did had to be jimmy norton it was jimmy norton again who will be at the stress uh factory  this weekend yes and i'll be showcasing my awards on the stage all right one more thing elton john 
[04:02:30]  i love him uh you heard this love him i read it on drudge so another public outburst from sir elton john  and this latest one at the cam film festival singer was co-hosting an awards ceremony with actress liz hurley  when things took uh kind of a nasty turn the reason apparently the media would just not settle down  that's always nice you know you warm yourself up to your fellow man when you say you should all 
[04:03:00]  be shot elton eventually handed out the award then he stormed out of the room how about this  cunt shut up when someone's talking you fucking dumb biased reporter holy that's it you warm yourself  upkeep fellow how about this you really warm yourself up when you're fucking yelling and  chatting while a guy's trying to hand out an award you fucking self-centered idiots good for elton  you should all be shot and he repeated it too he said something goes you should all be shot 
[04:03:30]  he didn't back off when he was challenged give that guy a cock on me  and finally where are you at with the uh davinci code uh me is it just a movie  yeah a lot of protesters like uh iraq saw the movie there was they were protesting like crazy  why are people protesting this they're douchebags fiction yeah it's yeah it's fiction there's just  idiots it's a movie based on you know it there's a factual thing factual is a theoretical uh theological 
[04:04:00]  thing that they took and made fiction out of it and why can't you do that they had police barricades  to keep the people back from harassing the people going to the movie theaters but they're yelling  and they're crying and they're handing out uh um pamphlets and and flyers and stuff they should  give away abortions with the uh ticket to the movie where the people are protesting and people  are going in watching the movie while getting an abortion i have really had it with fucking religious 
[04:04:30]  people yeah yeah i'm becoming more liberal in my old age i was going way conservative and i've had  enough of fucking catholicism and judaism and fucking islam and all of them enough with your  self-righteousness they are fantastic baptist love them episcopalians i wouldn't talk to one of  he was here what is an episcopalian who knows but the word piss is right there and yeah an e  an alien how do you not love alien i love those movies alien yeah he was one of the disciples that 
[04:05:00]  wasn't as popular as the other ones i think with a name like that yes of course not judas episcopal  episcopalian all right whatever your name is uh so the debate chill out it's only a movie it's only  fiction yeah question mark question mark oh yeah that's not what dan brown says the author of the  book dan brown what does he say he thinks it's gospel truth indeed his novel opens with the statement  that his book is based on documents that are accurate and other times he has said it is based on 
[04:05:30]  historical fact just like blair witch as we read below tragically many people believe this fiction  it's kind of funny that the people who like love the bible are questioning somebody else's  fucking credibility when there's really not much in the bible you can back up you can't really back  it up it's kind of faith-based you know you read it and you accept it because you just do through  faith ah we found noah's ark though where it's up on them mount ararat ararat you know they found 
[04:06:00]  something i saw the special it turned out to be nothing we don't like the fact that they took the  facts of this book that's right where the lady got taken out of the man's rib that book of facts  let me tell you this too a lot of people have read in the bible that uh adam you know god whatever  took a one of adam's ribs and made a woman out of one of his ribs and that is why men have one less  rib than women do yes and people fucking believe that we have the same amount of ribs assholes men and 
[04:06:30]  women same amount of ribs but do you know how many people actually believe women have more ribs than men  men because of the bible and because religious teaching that a rib came and that got more people  than not i say would would uh believe that men have less ribs than women i was at the cellar last night  talking to somebody it was me and russman eve and some other comedian and the other comedian knows 
[04:07:00]  somebody that works with school books in that business and he said that they will not even put a  picture of a monkey this is true in a lot of school books because these school boards are so afraid of  being sued okay hold on yep for both of us thank you they're so afraid of being sued for any type of  an evolution implication uh because these religious fucking nuts will not acknowledge evolution so here's  what happened the big bang happened x amount of billion years ago and there's all this stuff going on 
[04:07:30]  and yet they think it was six thousand years yeah they also think that seven days means literally seven  days like god before human beings were around had a fucking 24 hour schedule you literal dumb  motherfuckers like god was just sitting like god i could almost i could almost swallow the bible  if they understood symbolism seven days could be eight billion years maybe right god created man on the  yeah the fourth day all right that's five billion years all right whatever but no it's literal it's 
[04:08:00]  24 hours even on star trek they acknowledged we will now give you 10 earth minutes for you to make  peace with your maker like they understand it's earth minutes it's something like that seven days  if he's in charge of everything what the hell is a day to him but yeah he's on the same clock we are  right it's one sunrise one sunset what what if god was from jupiter and it's 10 hours thank god he  had only got half the work done just worked out perfect didn't it you fucking idiots 
[04:08:30]  holy shit does that irritate me i don't mind if that's your beliefs good for you pray do whatever  you want to do but now that the rest of us have to fucking suffer and look at your dumb faces with your  dumb signs it bugs me yeah 24 hours but on sunday he was tuckered out  was he same days of the week and everything of course he did how coincidental because he rested so  should we he took the day off fucking bugs me why we hang out and watch football on sunday exactly 
[04:09:00]  because it's his day of rest because while the lord rests black men bump into each other with a ball  and i say black men because there's no exciting white players left  no one after fucking michael vick nobody wants to see a white quarterback running around like  fucking larry flint  ah shit let's go home okay let's i'm gonna go home and i got both my richard prior pictures but i have 
[04:09:30]  to bring one back because the glass is a little scratched and they're gonna replace it for me  jeez they're free no no no it's museum glass i got especially oh non glare no but non glare but also you  don't lose any of some of the non glare you lose some quality because it's fuzzy yes you want the  highest resolution but the museum glass allows you to see it all and i want to thank um is this a  richard prior happy typing girl i actually recommended that to me because she works with art yes 
[04:10:00]  and i was talking to her and she told me i was putrid yeah all right all right let's go i'm not done  yet i'm ready to go i thought i didn't think go home no i wouldn't just leave you can just go home no  men leave men behind men's behind leave no man behind is this guy gonna do it or what swim from  alcatraz to san francisco oh who couldn't a seven-year-old exactly yeah they say this can't be done as a

[04:11:30]  him they drowned well certainly they drowned but there's never a record of them after the facts  now there's no record of them in any way shape or form he found the little flower at the end of  the movie i think they probably drowned to be honest with you just because they never found  again they never resurfaced but again i've also heard they got a little bit of outside help they  just kind of disappeared it's easier to disappear back then back then you make up another identity  you're done yeah they didn't have the internet so they didn't have like you know just disappear back  who is this guy america's most wanted busybodies i've heard they did actually get away i mean i hope
