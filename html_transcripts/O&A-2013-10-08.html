<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic introduction by William Shatner.  The hosts launched into a discussion about Tony Romo's poor football performance, using highly offensive language to describe his perceived inadequacies, contrasting this with Geno Smith's game-winning drive. This segued into a detailed examination of Curt Schilling's massive estate sale, stemming from the bankruptcy of his video game company, 38 Studios.  They reviewed the online listing, highlighting the absurdity of the items for sale (furniture, collectibles, DVDs, artificial plants) and expressing disbelief at Schilling's financial ruin.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton (in studio), speculated on the reasons for the company's failure and the psychological impact on Schilling.  A listener called in to mention the availability of Schilling's game for free.  A tangential discussion arose about actors who appeared in both *Twilight Zone* and *Star Trek*.  The segment heavily featured audio clips from a Sam Roberts interview with a seemingly optimistic Schilling, prior to his company's collapse.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Howard Stern's recent on-air segment about adopting kittens, met with bemusement and derision by Opie and Anthony.  This was followed by commentary on Miley Cyrus's provocative image and a movie review criticizing *Gravity*. The broadcast included the usual "Jocktober" segment mocking other radio personalities.  Paul McCartney was mentioned as being in the building, though no interaction occurred.

A significant portion focused on a scathing critique of the Cincinnati radio show "Jeff and Jen" on Q102, using audio clips and screengrabs from their show and Facebook page, which featured highly offensive and bizarre images (e.g., topless women with offensive slogans, a naked black man engaged in a sexual act with a KFC bucket, manipulated celebrity photos).  The hosts mocked the show's repetitive segments (including one about pumpkin spice lattes and another on men being better drivers than women), and its consistent prize of tickets to a children's theatre production of "Andy Jr."  The show's attempts at "Fake or For Real" and "Yes or BS" segments proved unsuccessful due to a lack of caller participation.

E-Rock, a staff member, appeared in studio to discuss the fallout from Greg Hughes accidentally broadcasting his phone number on air.  Another staff member recounted meeting and photographing Paul McCartney.  The discussion detailed E-Rock's Disney World vacation, including his stay at the Yacht Club Resort, his use of a Park Hopper Pass, attendance at the Magic Kingdom Halloween party, a spontaneous trip to Universal Studios, and participation in Epcot's Food and Wine Festival.  He described specific meals, drinks, and rides, particularly highlighting the intensity of "Mission: SPACE."  The conversation focused heavily on the massive influx of calls, texts, and MMS messages following the accidental broadcast, rendering his phone unusable, and E-Rock's anger at the lack of a timely "dump button" use.  Opie's generosity in covering E-Rock's expenses, including a new phone, was also discussed.  A subplot involving E-Rock unfriending and refriending people on Facebook, notably Travis, was also covered. The segment included a detailed breakdown of E-Rock's vacation expenses and debate on whether an apology from Greg was warranted.

The show concluded with further discussion of the prank call gone wrong and its aftermath, focusing on the harassment E-Rock received and the financial compensation from Opie (the exact amount not revealed).  Numerous callers expressed outrage and amusement at the situation.  E-Rock's initial anger transitioned to amusement as the compensation became clearer.  The hosts also briefly discussed technical issues with the show's Audible availability, past incidents like the "cinnamon challenge", and Curt Schilling's financial struggles.  Throughout the entire broadcast, the hosts and guests used highly offensive language.

[00:03:30]  Thank you.  This is the O.P. and Anthony channel.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  a little.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Oh, man.  I was just telling Jim Norton that Gino Smith did exactly what Tony Romo did not do the other day. 
[00:04:30]  Against the Broncos.  And I said that...  Oh, what did I...  I can't repeat it.  Wow.  No, I actually saw the end of that game last night.  You did?  Yeah, it was on.  And I'm like, wow, this is, like, really close.  So you should talk about it, because I actually did not see it, and I'm just making this shit up.  I saw the highlights this morning, but...  I was a little nervous there at the end.  I don't even care. 
[00:05:00]  But it's like, oh, my God.  You know, the Jets ticked the clock down to, like, two seconds for the field goal.  And I'm thinking, why not keep, like, ten seconds on there, so just in case something screws up.  But, no, they...  Imagine, you know, the coach is watching the clock before the timeout, and then he gets distracted.  Yeah, it's like some guy, hey, coach!  Oh, what?  You turn around, what do I get...  Oh!  Don't!  Has anyone ever done that?  I don't know.  But, uh...  Missed the timeout?  The Jets rookie quarterback, Geno Smith, marches down the field at the end there and does what Romo didn't do against the Broncos, 
[00:05:30]  and the Jets kick a 43-yard field goal and beat the fucking Falcons!  Wasn't even, like, close.  Who the hell is the guy kicking for the Jets?  He's very good.  Yeah, it went.  Uh-huh.  Yep.  It went between the uprights.  Oh!  That's why they call him Wentz.  Ah.  Yeah.  Yeah, people complaining.  People got so mad at me for bitching about Romo.  Nick Folk?  It's a defense!  Nick Folk?  Yeah, it is Nick Folk, of course. 
[00:06:00]  The defense didn't throw the interception.  He's a fucking choke.  Right.  So all you big Cowboy fans out there that want to fucking cry, he's a fucking choke.  I've been a Cowboy fan since 1978.  The guy is not a big game guy.  I don't care if the defense gave up 100 and he scored 101.  That cocksucker threw an interception with less than two minutes coming from his own end zone.  He's a choke.  But you're not being fair, because I think that's the first time he's ever done that, Jim Norton.  He doesn't do that a lot.  No, that is true.  And he can't actually hold a snap when a field goal is being kicked. 
[00:06:30]  No, he doesn't fall apart every time.  That's the point, Jim, you were trying to make yesterday.  I mean, sure, he threw for, what, over 500 yards?  Great.  Five TD passes.  It was terrific, but when it came down to it, he wound up not getting it done.  That's the problem.  Is he, the fucking Tom Brady got it done.  Fucking, you know, Peyton Manning got it done.  Gets it.  Well, Peyton Manning chokes a little bit in the playoffs.  Although not this week.  People get mad at Jimmy, though. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my God.  I read those tweets.  Fuck you.  Who cares?  Who gives a fuck?  Get mad.  Turn the radio off.  Hang yourself.  Do whatever you got to do.  But Romo's a cunt and a choke.  Sorry.  But we're talking about Gino Smith now.  Gino did just that.  He has that heart.  He has that something.  Then he marched down the field when the Jets needed it, and they win.  They beat the Falcons.  Do you understand?  That's a huge upset.  Ooh.  Huge upset.  A lot of people lost money yesterday.  Yeah?  I would think.  I can't imagine a lot of people were picking the Jets over the Falcons. 
[00:07:30]  So what?  Is he going to be the guy?  Is he the go-to guy now?  He is the guy.  He's the guy.  And Sanchez has got to be more and more pissed.  Oh, man.  Sanchez is hoping that he throws the interception.  Are you kidding me?  He doesn't want him to succeed because that's his gig.  Well, apparently not anymore.  Well, no.  He's got the shoulder thing, too.  Go for him.  He's got that thing with his shoulder.  Go for you.  So. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I was very excited to wake up to hear the Jets won.  What time did the game end?  I don't know.  What the fuck time was that?  I was, like, going through the channels trying to find something.  And I just decided to watch, like, three Columbo's in a row.  Fucking Netflix.  That show was great.  Columbo?  It was just so goofy.  I noticed every episode of Columbo has at least five people from various Twilight Zones in it.  And, like, three people from Star Trek. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And they're just a little older, so it takes a little while.  I'm, like, oh, that's, oh.  There was a woman on there, and she was from Twilight Zone and Star Trek.  She was the, and I never knew that.  Remember the Twilight Zone with Room for One More, Honey?  Of course.  In the morgue?  Of course.  The woman, like, has this horrible dream that she's in a hospital, and she gets in the elevator and goes down to the morgue.  And the elevator opens, and there's some woman standing there, and she goes, room for one more, honey. 
[00:09:00]  And then it ends with her not getting on an airplane, and the airplane crashes.  Yeah.  Yeah, ooh, because the woman that she saw saying, room for one more, honey, was the one at the gate getting people on the plane.  She's like, wah!  She freaks out and leaves, and the plane fucking crashes.  Wow.  That was a good one.  I like that one.  It was a classic.  Some brilliant writing, man.  Oh, my God, yeah.  And she was also fucking Spock's bride in Amok Time to Pring. 
[00:09:30]  She was.  Same woman.  Wow.  I was like, holy fuck, look at that.  And then Dr. Janice Lester, the one that took over Kirk's fucking mind and was a little bitch, she took over Kirk's body.  And Kirk was in her woman body.  Oh, it was a horrible episode.  I think it was, like, the last one they ever filmed in Star Trek.  And she was in it in the same episode.  It's, like, crazy. 
[00:10:00]  And then Crazy Charlie X, the kid that used to fucking Charlie X.  I don't care.  The wacky kid that would make his eyes go white and fucking, you know, fuck shit up.  Yeah.  He was in one.  And Columbo himself, Peter Falk, was in a Twilight Zone.  Played that Cuban fucking leader guy.  Oh, it was crazy.  What year is this?  Oh, yeah.  What?  What year is this?  Did we go back in time?  Oh, my God.  And then that old, what's the fucking old guy that's like, well, Lieutenant Columbo, I don't need you to tell me this. 
[00:10:30]  I could, God.  Oh, there's just the old actors with bad comb overs.  And it was a fun night of watching Columbo.  Well, those guys were in everything.  They made the rounds.  You know?  Yes.  Back in the 70s and 80s, these guys were, they were character actors and they just did every fucking show.  They were on everything.  Yeah. 
[00:11:00]  So fucked up.  I don't know.  Every time I watch a Columbo episode, too, I just, like, if the guy just kept his mouth shut.  Of course.  Columbo's got this weak fucking hypothesis.  And then at the end, the guy always goes, so if it wasn't for the cup, you never would have gotten me.  Well, it had the cup.  It was, uh.  And they're like, huh.  And then they just arrest him.  It's like, fuck it.  Just keep your mouth shut and say no.  You're almost clear.  He's barely got you on something.  He's always walking away, Columbo.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  He's walking away.  Shut your fucking mouth.  He might turn his head.  Just go, I don't know.  I don't know.  Don't give an explanation.  Right.  The guy's almost in his car.  And he turns around.  And you're willing to give up a little more info.  What's wrong with you?  I can't understand why he would have had a, hadn't have gotten a rent-a-car sooner.  Well, obviously, Lieutenant.  He didn't have a driver's license at the time.  That's it.  See, I should have asked you this sooner.  And then there it is. 
[00:12:00]  Don't give him explanations.  You just dig yourself in a deeper hole.  Yeah, he's not asking for your help.  He's trying to nail you.  Right.  Yes.  Columbo.  I love Columbo.  Peter Falk was great.  Oh, my God.  Kurt Schilling is pretty much selling his...  What's he selling now?  You haven't seen this yet?  The big sock is gone, right?  Oh, boy.  The sock has got to be gone.  Me and Travis, we're talking about this.  What now?  Just before you arrived.  It's deeply depressing. 
[00:12:30]  Kurt Schilling and his video game company went...  Not for Yankee fans.  Went balls up.  For Yankee fans.  It's funny.  Huge bankruptcy case.  And now it's gotten down to the point.  He's selling almost everything in his house.  Oh, boy.  I'm looking for the list right now.  He got himself in such bad fucking debt with that dumb video game idea he had.  Former Boston Red Sox pitcher Kurt Schilling, whose video game company collapsed into bankruptcy last year, prompting a high-profile lawsuit in Rhode Island, is selling off furniture, sports collectibles, and even artificial plants from his Massachusetts home. 
[00:13:00]  This is how bad it's gotten.  Artificial plants?  Oh, my God.  An estate sale company has scheduled a sale of items from Schilling's seven-bedroom, 8,000-square-foot Medfield residence for Saturday.  So this Saturday, if you're in the area, you could get sofas, porch rockers, candlesticks, a baby grand piano, a punching bag, a Hummer golf cart. 
[00:13:30]  Got a good workout, that punching bag.  Fucking asshole video game idea.  An empty tissue box.  Fuck Mario Brothers.  Fuck Grand Theft.  What else?  Where was I?  A baseball glove chair.  That's got to be great. 
[00:14:00]  And a vintage Coca-Cola vending machine.  Oh, but that's not all.  Yeah, it gets a lot worse than that.  Really?  Where do I go now here?  Well, I don't know if it's...  For the thrifty spenders, he's got some low-cost items.  Like?  DVDs, like The West Wing.  He's selling his copy of The West Wing.  How much?  A DVD.  No way.  It's probably about 10 bucks, I would guess.  No way is he doing this.  He could use 10 bucks.  Will he be there or no?  He's selling his baseball bobblehead collection. 
[00:14:30]  Those bobbleheads are pretty popular items.  He's selling his copy of World of Warcraft.  I bet he is.  Like just a game.  I bet he is, because that's what fucked him over.  This is unbelievable.  And...  Why would you put all your money into one...  Oh, God.  Anyone that has like financial people, they always tell you, you got to kind of diversify.  Diversify.  Put a little here, put a little there.  Damn.  I said to Sam this morning, I'm like, this is what like a kid would do if he got a lot  of money. 
[00:15:00]  Like, I'm going to make a video game company.  Right.  Yeah.  And he's...  He lost millions of dollars.  He had millions and he lost it all.  He lost, I think, up to...  What's the number now?  Uh, he invested 50 million in 38 studios and has lost all the money earned over his  20-year career.  He lost every cent of money he made pitching for 20 years.  Wait, in 38 studios?  He had that many...  In that many studios building this?  No, no, no, no.  Oh, okay, okay. 
[00:15:30]  I think you're 30...  All right, that makes sense.  The company's 38 studios, yes.  But what a dope to do that.  His old number.  50 million?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I guess his home he bought from Drew Bledsoe.  For a 4.5 mil, he's selling it for 3 mil.  You know, it's just a 1.5 million dollar loss.  He just needs the cash.  He tried to sell it a couple years ago for 8, but nobody wanted it.  Oh, my God.  Because it had all this stuff in it.  Now he's getting rid of all this junk.  Nice day, he can pick it up and carry it.  It's nice and empty.  And then there's another angle where Rhode Island itself owes 90 million. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, they're suing him.  They're suing him for the 90 million.  Yeah.  Because they owe 90 million as well.  Holy shit.  He's also selling many copies of his wife Shonda's book, The Best Kind of Different, about their son with Asperger's Syndrome.  Oh, God.  This just gets sadder and sadder.  He's selling his copy?  No, many copies.  Many copies.  They have cases of it in their house that didn't sell.  Oh, no.  And so now he's just trying to sell all these books that nobody wanted to buy in the first place.  Does he just fucking...  He's got to sit there constantly thinking how awful a turn his life took. 
[00:16:30]  He didn't even get to do drugs.  He didn't get to be like an alcoholic.  You think so?  I go way back with Kurt Schellen.  We've lost touch many years ago.  Yeah, but that's not how he lost all his money.  He used to love the drink.  Yeah, you're right.  Throw him a few bucks.  Come on, Ope.  In the Rochester years, he loved the drink.  Help him out.  But he didn't, like, throw it all away.  But I think he found Jesus.  He found Jesus?  Look what Jesus did.  Boy, if I found Jesus and then lost this, I would be fucking fairly upset. 
[00:17:00]  You wouldn't be about the Jesus.  It's a test.  Yeah.  That's what you say.  You go, Jesus is testing us.  Well, the company that's in charge of the sale says downsizing is a part of life.  He lost $50 million.  And they're saying that's all the money he earned.  Yeah.  He must have earned more than $50 million in his career.  Screw your dumb dream of being the next fucking World of Warcraft guy or EverQuest or something. 
[00:17:30]  Or put a taste into it.  Yeah.  Right.  Put $5 million in it.  Yeah, you could tell your friends, yeah, I'm into this game company.  Put 10% of your worth in there, maybe.  Yeah, how about just be part owner instead of...  Yeah, a little taste, maybe.  Do you just have started seeing movie Money Go and then just kept, couldn't accept that he was going to lose $3 million?  And it's like, fuck it, I got...  Oh, no.  Like, maybe he saw Money Go and just kept throwing Money in to try to stop the bleeding and it just...  This is one of the worst things ever to happen to an athlete.  I don't know how to feel because I hate Curt Schilling because he beat the Yankees.  But then again, I don't want to see a guy's life ruined.  He's a nice man. 
[00:18:00]  He really...  Is he a nice man?  Yeah, very nice.  Okay.  When I knew him back in the day, he was a very nice dude.  Is he?  A solid dude, Curt Schilling.  When he was up here promoting his game, he was a very nice dude.  Do we have audio of that?  I think so.  I think I'm really impressed with him.  Oh, no.  And he talks about his game.  I need him talking about this game that was going to set the world on fire.  It's going to be great.  Yeah.  I'm sure he regrets signing the ball I had for him for free.  You have a Curt Schilling signed ball?  Yeah.  He might want that back.  Yeah.  Why don't you give it back to him?  Yeah, you should give it back.  I'll just send him $10. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  Send him a copy of the West Wing.  You could get...  Yeah.  It's probably possible to get him to sign one now.  I bet.  If he's selling $10 DVDs, you get that fucking ball signed.  He's really selling $10 DVDs?  He's selling the West Wing.  Why doesn't he set himself up with like a fucking...  You know how they'd go out and just have shit signed?  Like he'll sit there and just sign a bunch of shit for some cash.  I'm sure he's doing all that, but he owes so much fucking money.  You mean baseballs you got to sign to make $90 million?  Just one for $90 million. 
[00:19:00]  No.  And he bought his house back in the day from good old Drew Bledsoe.  Yeah, we were just talking about that.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  What'd you say?  What did I miss?  Four and a half mil?  Yeah, we just said that.  Oh, and selling it for three?  Yeah.  Holy fuck, are you serious?  Yeah, then Anthony said, is that a $1.5 million loss?  Oh my God, I'm sorry.  And I remember thinking...  I'm heating up.  I feel like an idiot.  This is how specific that was.  I almost said, like, oh, I almost did a literal gym when you said that.  Oh, that is a lot of money.  Yeah.  Oh, but no, Anthony, that's really a loss. 
[00:19:30]  That's a lot.  Wow, so...  How do you, like...  But if he gets the $3 million on the house, he has to get rid of that, too.  Well, you know, he tried to sell it for $8 million a few years ago, but nobody wanted it.  That's what Anthony said.  Oh, Travis.  Everyone's confused today.  Oh my God, sorry about that.  You want to look at his stuff online?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to see it.  Let's bid on it.  Like, his dream came true.  He got to be the one in a billion who gets to play for the Boston Red Sox.  Dream come true? 
[00:20:00]  And then everything collapsed anyway.  Where did it come out of?  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton on the island with two very bad knees.  And a dream to become a Major League Baseball player.  Apparently, that dream is pretty fucking powerful.  I think God, his dream came true.  Oh.  What is that?  Flubber hats? 
[00:20:30]  He's selling flubber hats.  What is that?  Are they signed?  Yes.  I don't know by who.  He signed flubber hats.  No, it doesn't look like it.  It looks like Robin Williams.  What?  Robin Williams.  He was in the movie Flubber.  He was in the movie Flubber.  You're right, Robin Williams.  You look at that quick, though.  That looks like a Curt Schilling.  No, he's selling.  But now I see Robin Williams.  Robin Williams.  Because if you have Robin Williams autograph, you want to have a flubber hat.  So he probably got a couple of these flubber hats from the movie Flubber.  And Robin Williams signed.  You guys can both buy one.  How much? 
[00:21:00]  What is that?  A bunch of baseballs.  Is that a cassette tape?  These are probably.  Case?  That's a cassette tape.  What is this?  He's not even displaying his stuff properly.  The Paul Pitcher's story.  There's a phone number on it.  Oh, no.  Which they probably shouldn't have.  Oh, no.  Whose phone number is that?  Doesn't matter.  We won't talk about it.  Wow.  This is just.  He probably didn't take these pictures.  This has got to be someone who's just doing this.  This is his junk.  Probably the consignment.  You think he just left and they're just doing it? 
[00:21:30]  That looks like a good video game.  No.  Wow.  What's that video game?  I want to play that.  Well, you can probably get it cheap.  Oh.  It's a giant poster for the video game he made.  Oh, is that it?  It was called The Reckoning?  Well, it wrecked him.  Yes.  Yeah.  What an appropriate name.  It's Coca-Cola Machine.  Oh.  How much is that?  He probably hates selling that.  He probably loves it.  Oh.  How much is that?  I don't know.  It doesn't matter.  I'm going to help an old pal out.  Maybe I get a Coca-Cola Machine out of it.  These are collectible, and if I could get it for the right price, I want it. 
[00:22:00]  Here's his punching bag.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  Let me ask you about this stuff.  Do you go to the house and buy it, or do you?  Oh, yeah.  It'll probably be set up like a museum.  You walk around.  Oh, his backyard furniture.  He's selling his backyard patio furniture.  It's just going to be a bunch of creeps walking around his house buying things.  All the family memories that happen there.  He was one of the best.  He won't be there.  I doubt it.  Yeah, you should find it depressing.  He definitely still lives there. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, no.  They don't want to say that, but...  Oh, not my toothbrush.  Where else would he be living?  He's got nowhere else to go.  He can't afford rent.  Dude, he's selling everything.  Everything.  Oh.  It's an estate sale.  He's selling everything.  But why are you fucking consents?  Oh, my God.  That shitty plant.  Artificial plant he's selling?  I want that.  You want that?  Oh, it's rocking chairs.  He's selling.  I saw him sell a rocking chair once.  More dumb plants.  More horrible artificial plants.  When is this sale happening? 
[00:23:00]  I'm not sure.  Chairs.  Horrible, just bad furniture.  Trees.  A mirror.  Guardian mirror.  Candlesticks.  Oh, his candlesticks have price tags on them.  Oh.  That's his stuff.  Oh, no.  They probably told him, you know, all these little knickknacks add up.  People want this kind of memories.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Those are like old flowers wilting.  Turn it a little bit, Sam.  I can't see it.  I think they're fake.  Terrible.  They almost look like they.  Okay.  They almost look just like old flowers.  Oh, that's nice.  What is that?  A credenza? 
[00:23:30]  It's a china cabinet.  China cabinet.  That's nice.  Go fast.  T set.  I mean, we got 150 of these.  I know.  Keep going fast.  Oh, my God.  How much is that?  It's 165 bucks for that vase.  A little vase.  But they'll take less.  Tiffany vase.  And then every time.  Yeah, I think it will.  Oh, they'll take less.  They want all this sold.  So, if you buy it, you could just be like, hey, by the way, you see that vase?  You know where I got that?  Curt Schilling's house.  These are custom-made sofas. 
[00:24:00]  Are they?  You know who they were made for?  Curt Schilling.  Curt Schilling.  Oh, boy.  That's a big house.  A lamp.  Well, because he used to be a very wealthy baseball player.  Drapes.  Horrible.  Heavy drapes.  Selling the drapes.  This is depressing, man.  Go faster.  Look at all the tags on everything.  His piano.  His baby grand.  Oil and vinegar.  Oh, no.  Why would you...  That poster, by the way, should have a big rip in it.  Like, why would that poster still be upright? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  A fucking...  You want to buy a reckoning poster with a shotgun hole in it?  It has to be said.  People have said that Curt is one of the biggest assholes in baseball, but that was not my experience  and it was not Sam's experience when he came in here.  He could have been nicer.  Individually priced.  His glasses.  Just like fucking...  One of his celluline.  Look at all these price tags on his drinking glasses.  On his drinking glasses?  All his glassware has sticky price tags on them. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, my God.  I bet you the sports stuff goes fast.  You think so?  Yeah, the baseballs and shit like that.  Where's he going to live after this?  ESPN Studios.  Is he on ESPN?  He is an analyst for ESPN, yeah.  That might be a couple hundred thousand a year, right?  I don't know.  She got the Curt Schilling chair.  Easily.  Yeah, but now ESPN knows they can get him cheap.  Yeah.  Because this is all out there.  They're going to renegotiate his deal.  Well, his co-workers should just go buy this stuff and use it in front of them.  What is that?  Look at all these electronics.  I see a lock.  A shitty old camera. 
[00:25:30]  A shitty camera.  A fucking...  Deck of cards.  An old Apple...  An old Apple Power Supply.  Or a MacBook Charger.  Oh, my God.  Microsoft Office in the box.  There's a deck of bicycle playing cards there.  That's nice.  He needs to play some cards.  Yeah.  And a...  There's a Boston Red Sox baseball.  Oh.  Remember when he played baseball for the Red Sox?  Yeah.  A lock that probably doesn't have the correct combination.  His microwave.  He doesn't know what it is.  No, he has to.  He's selling his microwave oven.  And you know you're not going to get more than $15 for a microwave. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  You can buy a new one for like $70.  And you're always going to need a microwave.  Yeah.  Because doesn't...  Wherever he goes to live, he's going to need some of this stuff.  He's going to need a microwave.  He's going to be like, no, we sold it for $15.  How is that?  For some Christmas stuff.  Holiday decor.  He's selling his holiday stuff.  Oh, my God.  The stuff you keep in a closet until the holidays.  Because there's no Merry Christmas at the Schilling House this year.  Look at all these crutches he's getting rid of.  Oh, probably from when his foot was all fucked up.  Yeah.  All right.  That ties into the bloody sock.  He's got terrible Christmas decorations. 
[00:26:30]  He's got bad taste, actually.  Yeah, he's fucking awful.  A lot of this shit is horrible.  I would just buy a fuckload of tube socks and a razor blade and just cut myself and stain  them with blood and just sell them.  Look at this.  It's not the sock, but it's my sock.  It's got blood on it.  Same thing?  Yeah, yeah.  This is a novelty locker that says Schilling on it.  Wow, that's going to be a big one.  That'd be cool.  It's depressing.  They have a son.  His drum set.  But it looks like his kid's drum set.  It's like kicked over. 
[00:27:00]  He's even selling his kid's stuff.  I'm assuming his kid's name.  Is his kid's name Grant?  Because there's a dinosaur with the name Grant written on it.  That's for sale?  He's got a Bob Grant.  Oh, his jackets.  Oh, his jackets.  Probably dope jackets in there.  When does this happen?  Horrible towels.  Beach towels.  There's that Schilling locker.  When is this?  Do we know?  Saturday.  Oh, this Saturday.  Look at all those copies of his wife's book that didn't sell.  Who wants to read about that stuff? 
[00:27:30]  I don't know, but they're going cheap.  It's the closet full of books.  Oh, my God.  It's terrible.  So what do you do?  Do you vacate and they come in and just say, fuck it and price everything?  I guess, yeah.  I guess you get out because you can't look at it anymore?  Yeah, an auction house comes in and figures out how much they can get for this shit.  His chair is shaped like a baseball mitt because that's what he used to play and made a whole bunch of money.  That's the baseball glove chair.  How many times do you think he's sat in that?  Yeah, this is the life.  No, those are kids' chairs.  You can tell. 
[00:28:00]  Those are for the kids.  Yeah, for better times.  Oh, he's selling his kids' teddy bear.  He's selling his kids' teddy bear.  It's not fun anymore.  This is terrible.  A gargoyle, probably from the Reckoning game.  There's a Ms. Pac-Man machine.  Why don't we get a Ms. Pac-Man machine in the air?  You should have stuck to just playing that instead of trying to come up with your own game.  We can buy Curt Schilling on the show.  Yeah, meanwhile, he's got a different version of Pac-Man.  I'm just going to bomb on that.  Oh, yeah.  He's certainly...  That was zero confidence.  Yeah, no. 
[00:28:30]  I was trying to put it together.  Sometimes you just throw it out and put it together as your words are forming.  As you're saying it, yeah.  That was not happening.  Sometimes it doesn't work.  No, I was juggling.  At one point, he was making so much money, he could buy himself a Hummer golf cart.  Yeah, look at that.  Now he's selling it.  Golf.  Golf cart.  Like Fog.  Fog.  The Bambino ice resurfacing machine.  What?  Zamboni.  He's selling his Zamboni.  What, did he have a pond out back for hockey?  He must have.  Probably a little mini Zamboni he's selling.  Yeah, it's not a care in the world. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, his fucking lawnmower.  Oh, he's selling his...  The ice mower.  There is so much junk.  What is that he's selling?  It's a sink and a mirror.  Old school.  Those are some antiques.  Oh, God.  It's a snake.  Wait a minute.  Why would you take a picture?  It's an angry bird stuffed animal.  I actually got that.  You can't get more than 50 cents for that. 
[00:29:30]  What is he doing?  It looks like something you win at a carnival.  Yeah.  It's an angry bird ball that you throw around the fucking house.  How much is he possibly going to get for his kids' toys?  This is not cool, man.  Do you think he's on this site right now, too, just looking and having memories all this season?  Oh, I remember that.  I'm laughing that chair.  Brand new games.  He never got a chance to play these games.  He's too busy making his own.  Right.  Getting ideas.  Yeah.  Oh, here's the DVDs.  His DVD collection is pretty sad.  Wrong.  He didn't even get a chance to watch wrong. 
[00:30:00]  And he bought all the DVDs at FYE, which means they're higher priced.  Oh, yeah.  FYE.  World of Warcraft right there.  Could you zoom in?  How much is he selling them for?  And zoom in.  I want to see more of these DVDs.  He's trying to get $35 for Rome.  That's not happening.  That ain't happening.  That's two seasons.  It's probably not going to happen.  Well, he should be signing all this stuff first.  What the fuck's for Rescue?  $20 for Rescue Me is not happening.  Grey's Anatomy.  He's trying to get $30 for his deluxe World of Warcraft.  Oh, God. 
[00:30:30]  Westway and Friends.  Slumdog Millionaire.  They didn't even get a chance to watch Slumdog.  It's still sealed.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great film.  Can you see any of the other names or that's about it?  Yeah.  Every season of the Westway.  People will buy this stuff, though, just because it was Curt Schilling's.  Not if he doesn't sign it.  Rescue Me.  You said that, right?  You want a flubber hat?  No.  Robin Williams signed a flubber hat.  I'd invite my friends over to watch Rome and then throughout the episodes just keep  reminding them who used to own this copy of Rome.  I know.  As you tipped your flubber hats to each other. 
[00:31:00]  You sat in your baseball glove chair.  Yes.  I want to go on a Curt Schilling shopping spree.  The whole collection.  I think you should both buy those flubber hats and wear them when he comes in.  It would be awesome.  Oh, my God.  Dude.  Imagine.  Imagine.  Imagine.  Hey.  Flubber hat.  Oh, my God.  Could someone buy us the flubber hats if you go into Curt Schilling's house Saturday?  Oh, poor Curt.  What else?  We're only halfway through the list.  Oh, that's depressing.  Oh, look.  He's got all these games.  CDs.  Games.  He's selling his game of life.  Oh, well. 
[00:31:30]  You know what happened there?  He ended up in the poorhouse.  Oh, it's the Disney VHS collection.  Nice.  That's his kids' movies.  His kids probably outgrew them, though.  Some of these are in the vault.  Yeah, you never outgrow these.  Yeah, that's true.  Hercules.  All right.  Shitty movies.  Oh, he's selling copies of Pirates of the Caribbean, two versions of Life After People,  Legally Blonde, Full Metal Jacket, Raising Helen. 
[00:32:00]  He's selling a copy of the film Rat Race starring Rowan Atkinson.  Not Fred Claus.  Yeah, he's getting rid of his fever pitch.  You know, he's going to sit home and want to watch Sweet Home Alabama and realize that  some asshole came into his house and bought it for 50 cents.  Oh.  Yeah, what could he get for an old DVD?  Nothing.  FYE won't even pay for him anymore.  Really?  It's physical media.  Nobody wants him.  No one.  That's really rough, man.  Yeah.  You should say he's going to sign all of them.  Everything.  Dude, he should be putting his name on everything. 
[00:32:30]  The fucking doors of the house.  Oh, his music collection?  No, these are-  More movies?  Video games.  Oh, video games.  Okay.  He loves good video game, doesn't he?  Not anymore, I bet.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  There's an empty sleeve.  You know what game used to go there?  They're all old CD-ROM games.  Yeah, terrible.  Do you think the first time he popped it in and his wife looked at it, she wanted to go  like, oh, this is not very good.  What are you doing?  How much of our money?  Yeah, $40 million, but look at this, the demons fall out of the lights.  Oh.  He's selling his copies of Nintendogs. 
[00:33:00]  What?  Nintendogs?  Yeah.  It's a game by Nintendo where you raise dogs.  He really got a little too deep into games.  That's stupid.  He's got all these Nintendo DSs, and two of them are customized for the game Nintendogs,  which he's selling.  He's also selling a PSP.  Dude, I bet he's bummed about this.  I would play Nintendogs if I knew it was Curt Schilling's copy.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  We're only halfway through. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, it's DJ Hero.  Nobody bought DJ Hero.  He can't stop buying games.  Nobody bought that game.  No one bought that.  They had Eminem and Jay-Z connected with it, and still nobody bought it.  No one cared.  Why would anybody?  DJing is already a video game.  Why do you need DJ Hero?  Well, they were going with the Guitar Hero thing, thinking that they could go to the next  level.  Fight for his kid.  How ridiculous would Curt Schilling look playing DJ Hero?  Well, what was it for him?  Ridiculous is selling all his shit.  Oh, no.  He's selling Drake and Josh on DVD, the best of seasons one through four. 
[00:34:00]  Holy shit.  The best.  It could be a Mortal Kombat for Xbox 360 game controllers.  This is Curt Schilling's estate sale.  It's going down Saturday, because he owes a lot of money.  Wait, how did he only make 50 million, but he owes over 100?  Like, did he borrow more than he ever made?  Probably.  Yeah.  He couldn't owe twice what he made, does he?  Oh, fuck.  We've got to crunch the numbers, but maybe, you know, he used his 50 million to get a nice 
[00:34:30]  big loan.  I don't know.  What's he got?  An old fucking sling box?  A very old sling box.  Oh, it's HD ready.  Wow.  HD ready.  Oh, good.  Oh, he's got a blanket with a B for Boston and a heart around it.  That ought to pull in something.  The site says that items are significantly discounted.  His scales?  You want a scale?  A bathroom scale? 
[00:35:00]  You shouldn't have bought that many scales.  Just piles of clothes.  T-shirts.  So when you're walking around Curt Schilling's house, you can pick up a pile of his clothes.  Look at his socks right there.  His khaki shorts.  He's going to want to wear his khaki shorts next summer, and he won't have them because  somebody bought them.  He'll be like, where is my cruise wear?  Got a bunch of Boston sports hats and then a signed EverQuest 2 poster.  Cabana wear.  Who signed that?  I don't know.  8,000 square feet.  Of shit for sale. 
[00:35:30]  No.  What is this stuff?  Sports stuff.  They're just calling it Odds and Ends.  Odds and Ends.  They're just going to throw all this stuff in a box and say everything in here a dollar  each.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, there's his bobblehead collection.  Bobbleheads.  He shouldn't have started a bobblehead collection in hindsight.  The bobbleheads.  That's all the Arizona Diamondbacks?  Yeah, well, he was on the team.  So he collected the whole team of bobbleheads? 
[00:36:00]  He probably gave them to them.  Mets.  And now it's pure profit.  He probably didn't pay for those.  This is pure profit.  It's not profit.  That'll put him over the top.  More just shitty electronics.  Wires.  A nebulizer compressor.  Ugh.  Ooh, that looks like an unopened Xbox.  Oh, he's got all his sports memorabilia McFarlane toys.  Oh.  Oh, starting lineup toys.  Look, he's got his Larry Bird action figure that he's selling.  Ugh.  You think Larry Bird would have to sell a Curt Schilling action figure?  I don't think so. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Poor fella.  What was he thinking?  I don't know.  He wasn't.  He's got his Halo version of the game of Risk also for sale.  Oh, God.  All right.  With his dumb games.  He spent too much money on tchotchkes.  Tchotchkes.  Scrabble.  Scrabble.  Scrabble.  People on World of Warcraft, the board game.  Ugh.  It's like, what letters do I have?  B-R-O-K-E. 
[00:37:00]  Uh.  Who's buying that Scrabble?  No one, unless maybe he signs it.  He's got, like, baseball dude sunglasses for sale.  Right.  Like the Jose Canseco type sunglasses.  Why does he need a microscope for?  Why did he buy it?  Because he could.  Look at his banks of time.  Very good.  He had limitless money until he made that big fucking investment.  He's got a solid toy Millennium Falcon.  Loves Star Wars. 
[00:37:30]  Holy fuck.  He's selling his kids' beds.  Oh, no.  And his kid's going to sleep.  It's kind of like those sort of bunk beds.  A little, yeah.  Like a loft and then a bed underneath type thing.  He's a little stuffed lobster.  Oh, that's nice.  He's selling a copy of Casey at the Bat.  Bulldog magazine.  And a Bulldog magazine.  All right.  Why wouldn't he just throw out the Bulldog magazine?  Right.  It's old.  Oh, more stuffed.  Oh, Pokemon.  This kid's stuffed animals.  Not a stuffed Pikachu. 
[00:38:00]  A little stuffed Pikachu.  Anybody want a stuffed Pikachu?  Seriously, $2, $2, stuffed Pikachu.  Lobster, stuffed frog, stuffed Obama, stuffed...  Is that a...  Yeah.  I guess you can only see half the...  Oh.  Um...  Let me...  It just got died.  What?  He's selling all his kids' toys.  How much did they expect to get?  They said that the sock got $92,000, which was less than expected. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, man.  I can't imagine they'd get more than a couple hundred thousand Saturday.  How much were they expecting for the sock, though?  What?  Eric, they got Harry Potter Legos for sale.  Oh.  Get a nice deal.  Wow.  Kurt Schilling's Harry Potter Legos.  That'd be so dope.  That would be.  Ooh.  More Legos.  Oh, it's a Lego Buzz Lightyear.  That's not an adult collectible.  That's a child's toy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Kids are going to want to play Legos.  We still have 50 to go.  Let's go.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:00]  More Legos.  Look at all these toys.  All right.  Now we're in the toys.  A lot of his kids' toys.  What about his kids?  Why do his kids...  Oh, his kids' fucking toy guns.  Dark guns and pirate swords.  Why do his kids have to sell all their shit?  Transformers and...  Individual action figures.  You're right.  Why does his kids have to sell all their shit?  Because he made a bad investment.  Daddy fucked up.  Daddy fucked up.  You think there was a little family meeting?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:39:30]  Did that wife give him fucking an earful?  His kids got to sell his T-Pain microphone that auto-tunes your voice.  You know how much fun he could have had with that?  Yeah.  Oh, the piano from the movie Big.  Oh, you lay it on the floor and you go ding, ding, ding.  No one could actually do that.  No.  Only that one guy could.  That was an FAO Schwartz.  Yes.  Yep.  I think it's still there.  It is.  Kurt Schilling and his kid definitely can't.  No. 
[00:40:00]  iPhone cases.  Not even for a current iPhone.  Maybe you have an old iPhone.  Everybody's not fancy with money.  Maybe that's from an older phone.  Why would they be displaying this?  Like, this is a big get.  Well, the iPhone case, the Mickey Mouse iPhone case is $6.  All right.  That's probably not going to happen.  Six more bucks in the fucking till?  You think that one's going to get haggled down?  Yeah.  Someone's like, I'll give you a buck.  And there's a case of assorted paper clips.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, you might need that.  I love paper clips.  Who doesn't?  Flip tripod. 
[00:40:30]  A tripod for a flip cam.  Flip's not even in business.  Flip cam went belly up like Kurt Schilling did.  He probably invested a lot of money in flip.  All right.  Wait a minute now.  All these tripods.  Is flip cam in there?  Are there any flip cams in there?  No, just a tripod.  Nobody uses flip cams.  No, they stink.  No, they used to be great.  They were great, but they always crashed.  I loved flip.  They came out at the worst time.  Worst time.  Why?  When phones started getting really good cameras.  Because phones just started getting good video cameras.  But the problem with phones is you can't leave your phone somewhere to tape your set. 
[00:41:00]  That's it.  Look at that.  A bathrobe.  38.  Shilling.  Red Sox.  Bathrobe.  That one shouldn't be on the rack with all that.  Matt Frost probably makes that.  Yeah.  Matt Frost.  When I met Mattingly, I said, yeah, my friend made a robe for you.  So he goes, Matt, right, he knows Matt Frost makes these fuck, he's got the contract for  Major League Baseball.  Really?  Yup, for these robes.  Good for him.  Damn.  It's his idea.  Did he make Robert Reeds?  Didn't need a lot of fabric.  A tattered one.  Yeah.  But imagine having the robe that says Shilling on the back.  That's a biggie. 
[00:41:30]  It's actually Shillings.  Why is that sitting in the rack of other shitty clothes?  That should be like displayed like sports memorabilia.  Because he never wore it, probably.  Oh.  Or maybe he wore it every day.  He probably did.  He did eight car garage.  Walking around the house.  Nude buttocks.  Mumbling.  Oh, it's his kid's sweater vest.  It's a terrible sweater.  I would wear that at a Christmas picture.  Yeah, but his kid's going to be so cold.  Oh, man.  What is that?  It's a kind of lace thing.  Those are accent pillows.  Oh, well.  Oh, my God.  You can't accent anything when you're broke.  They're getting five million less than they wanted a couple years ago. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, the bed.  Five million less.  The mat is gone.  Bedroom set.  Dressers.  Yeah, little dressers.  Well, if this is his house, it doesn't look that impressive.  It's a nice house.  Terrible taste.  We've seen pretty much every room now because it's filled with all this shit that he has  to sell.  Do you know how bad I want to drive up there just to buy those paperclips?  And just use them and tell everyone this needs to be Kirk Schilling's paperclip?  He's still focusing on the stupid Rome DVD.  Well, this says DVD's new, but the problem is that he bought it used from FYE. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  There's a tag that says used just because FYE reseals it.  Now they're trying to resell FYE's used...  I got a question.  Could the game ever come back that he invested in?  Oh, no.  It's gone.  Absolutely not.  Just totally done, huh?  Maybe like ironically in 10 years.  Was it really bad or was it just not as good as...  No one wanted to play it.  There's an inflatable bottle that says party time on a clock on it.  He's not going to be...  He hasn't celebrated in quite some time.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:00]  It's a party time.  Oh, my God.  There's no parties going on at the Schilling House.  Does anybody know why his game flopped?  Did it just suck?  It was not good.  It got very bad reviews.  And it's a very competitive business.  It got bad reviews.  And yeah, like it was kind of like a World of Warcraft game.  And when you've got a game that has already established itself as the best, it's kind  of like why would you use Bing when you've got Google?  Oh, yeah.  We're trying to come out with like a GTA game now.  Yeah, exactly.  It's just dumb.  Yeah.  Especially when you're not Microsoft, when you're just a dude who happens to have 50  million bucks.  Yeah.  He thought it was like, hey, I'm Curt Schilling. 
[00:43:30]  This is going to sell great.  He went all in.  That's so crazy.  Who does that?  He's not going to be able to play pinball on these machines ever again.  No.  Somebody's going to buy them for almost no money.  It's all fucking done.  Pool table.  Keep going.  Lord of the Rings pinball.  All right.  Arcade Legends.  It's an arcade system that's got every game on it.  Yeah, all the old games.  That could be cool.  He loves video games.  Oh, boy.  Ping pong table with the net that's down.  You see that?  Weight. 
[00:44:00]  His weight.  Oh, his blender.  He probably made protein shakes.  Selling his blender.  Keep his strength up when he's fucking playing ball.  More couches.  Stools.  Bad tables.  It's like a man cave.  His vacuum.  Selling his vacuum and his cordless drills.  Wow, they have fucking everything must go.  His router.  A router.  His dusty Linksys router.  He's...  Oh. 
[00:44:30]  Look at all those drills.  You shouldn't have bought so many.  No.  Why do you need so many cordless drills?  Oh, a Boston Red Sox bag.  A little duffel bag.  That's stuff you never really used.  It looks like a case full of t-shirts.  Look at all those tools.  What was he fixing?  He didn't need to buy all that.  Oh.  Yeah, I think we've seen the rest.  Yep.  Flubber hats.  Back to the flubber hat.  Keep going.  That's the highlight.  Nine to go.  Maybe this is another nugget in there.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Baseball.  Baseball.  Some of this stuff is on there twice.  The reckoning poster.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Coca-Cola machine. 
[00:45:00]  The dumb Coke machine.  Oh, yeah.  The punching bag.  Punching bag.  Table, yeah.  His patio furniture.  Okay.  His patio furniture.  Just memories for sale for very little while.  Wow.  That poor fuck.  That is terrible.  Let's put that on our Facebook page so people could go through it.  No.  How much could all that make for him?  50 million?  50 million.  He'd be lucky to get...  He'd be lucky to get 100,000 for that.  Oh, God.  Not even.  No way.  Like, for every single thing in the house. 
[00:45:30]  No.  Yeah, because some of those couches and stuff will probably get a few thousand.  He'll get 30 grand for everything.  You think 30 grand?  When you're totally bankrupt, do they just say, okay, now we're selling everything?  That might be one of the conditions of bankruptcy.  Yeah, now they roll in and they try to get as much of their money back as possible.  Oh, man.  Fuck.  Price to move.  State sale.  Let's say the couches get $40,000.  You've still got to make $60,000 to get to 100 grand and you're not going to do that.  You're right.  You don't really see anything there.  Those couches aren't making any $40,000 either.  No, absolutely not.  No.  I'm not paying $40,000 for Curt Schilling's old couches. 
[00:46:00]  What about the fucking golf cart and the fucking lawnmower?  The Hummer golf cart?  The Coca-Cola machine.  I give you $700 for that Hummer golf cart.  Sold.  Okay.  Wow.  I'll take it.  I would love to know what his perspective is on this.  How awful this must feel.  He's kind of happy about it.  Oh, yeah, but I mean, what's it, how did this fucking, where did he realize it was at the  point of no return?  Like, what happened, like, what day?  After he talked to Sam.  Yeah, he realized none of my listeners were buying that game. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, is that, how long ago was he in for that?  It was when the game, it was a week before the game came out.  A year and a half ago, maybe?  That's it?  A year and a half, two years ago?  This all went down within the last two years?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He was pretty excited about the launch of the game?  Oh, he's pumped.  He, yeah, he loved, like, this is his love.  Like, he loves these RPGs.  Oh, God.  He loved the idea of creating one.  Oh.  And he was super psyched for this game.  Do you think he had any inkling that it wasn't going to work?  No, he thought it was.  Does there any video online of what this game looked like in-game? 
[00:47:00]  I'm curious.  I don't think you go 50 million deep into something you don't have complete confidence in.  No, no, no, I mean, by the time it came out, though, like, did something happen  where he was like, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  But who was advising him?  I know, right?  You could have a lot of confidence, but who's going to tell you?  Yeah, why don't you go all in with everything you have in the bank?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I want to hear a clip of him on your show. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I want to hear that.  Knowing now that it all went belly up.  Oh, it went south really quickly.  Oh, that poor fuck.  He was rich.  I mean, really rich.  I should have made a baseball game.  Right?  He knows a little bit about baseball.  Hey, look, it's the Curt Schilling pitch with your bloody ankle game.  What's this?  I can still walk through the video game.  A five-minute taste.  I'm curious.  Reckoning.  And now, we've got to get you out of there.  Here you get your first glimpse of the Well of Souls, the place of your rebirth. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, this sounds terrible.  Combat in Reckoning is intuitive and accessible.  You can chain together basic attacks with a single button.  Oh.  Sell your stuff.  Oh, it's...  Well done.  Collecting loot is a big part of the game.  While you loot, you can compare items and decide whether they are worth equipping now or saving them in the sell-off later.  It's just the same thing.  Just sounds like an awful...  Just by varying the timing of your basic attacks, you'll perform special moves, like launching an opponent into the air and juggling it. 
[00:48:30]  Compared to GTA, though?  Using your shield for a well-timed parry can open up an even more damaging attack chain on your stunned opponent.  You know, IGN gave this a 9 out of 10.  Wow.  Really?  What happened?  Can't we fast-forwarded to...  You know how crazy he must have been when he heard that?  Your first introduction to the outside world of Reckoning.  What happened?  It's a peaceful place.  A relatively safe start to your hero's journey.  You now have both primary and secondary weapons equipped.  And even as a melee fighter, you'll unleash powerful battle magic on your enemies. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, boy.  Yeah, it received generally very good reviews.  It just didn't succeed.  Sometimes you're rewarded with opportunities to dispatch enemies with a special fate shield kill.  Building up enough fate energy allows you to perform even more powerful attacks.  Was this online, though?  Or was it just stand-alone, um...  I think it was, like, Xbox.  Reckoning features a robust crafting system.  Here, for example, you might try your hand at Sagecraft.  Using the Salter, you insert a magical gem into a longsword, upgrading it to a more powerful flaming sword. 
[00:49:30]  I don't like the little circle of fire that's always with him.  That's irritating.  This dumb sword.  Heard it.  It's so hot.  Combat and Reckoning is all about the choices you make.  The problem is, this has been done so many fucking times already.  We get it.  The mighty fucking epic weapon and the fucking powers and the...  It's been done a thousand fucking times.  How about a guy that's running around looking in upside-down hats for gold eggs? 
[00:50:00]  How about a gold eggs?  Why?  Let me go to Adam in Illinois.  Adam?  Hey, boys.  Hey, buddy.  Just so you know, Kurt's game can be yours through Sony on PlayStation for free right now.  Oh, no.  It's down to free?  Free.  Absolutely free.  The cost has gone down to free.  Why free?  Because nobody's going to purchase it.  No one would pay for it.  But can't they just throw him a bonga luck, everybody? 
[00:50:30]  Three dollars.  Three bucks.  Come on.  Let's help him out a little bit.  Can 20 million of you buy this for a buck?  Right.  Wow.  Thanks, Adam.  Yep.  This is a horrendous story.  And if it got great reviews and everyone liked it, what was it that you think just...  It's just an unnecessary game.  Like, it was like...  There was no sort of, like, yeah, it's good, but there are already good games like that.  Yeah.  I'm already playing that game.  Right.  It's World of Warcraft.  Yeah, I'm not going to stop playing a game that I've leveled up to fucking level umpteen  million to go start pounding on rats in town square. 
[00:51:00]  It's like coming out with a delicious cola.  However, I already have a cola.  Right.  It's called cum.  That's not a cola.  You know how hard it's got to be for this guy to sleep at night?  Not only did he lose all that money, he knows that the game got really good reviews.  He's got to be out of his fucking mind.  He made a good game.  Right.  Oh.  Because maybe in the end you lose the money, but, you know, the game was shit, but they're  saying that the game was not shit.  Maybe that's the only thing that's keeping him from throwing himself in front of a train. 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  And that he knows it just didn't work.  But it wasn't his fault.  Yeah, but D didn't work meaning you lose everything.  That's just insane.  Lose everything.  Because the guy had enough money to live for the rest of his life very, very well.  Now he's going to be just...  Apparently he was very thrifty with his money looking at his goods.  Right.  We've got to get those flubber hats.  He put all his money into that dumb game instead of his house.  I think he's working out thinking that maybe I could get that fastball up one more time. 
[00:52:00]  He's not working out.  He doesn't have any weights.  Come back as an old pitcher.  Oh, my God.  Just to get a few more mil.  That's so bad.  Oh, there's a picture of Sam and Kurt.  Kurt's happy there.  I'd love to hear him talk about his game.  Yeah, we're trying to...  Let me find a...  Yeah, you've got to find a clip.  You don't have any?  He'd be so happy, I bet, right?  He's all like, yeah, this is going to be great.  Right.  Well, we've got food in front of us, so we'll break. 
[00:52:30]  Maybe we'll have the clip of Kurt Schilling talking about this game that went belly up.  He was on Sam's show right before the launch.  Oh, boy.  And, you know, we'll be doing Jocktober and other things today as well.  Ooh, yes.  It's a miserable story.  It's frightening.  But doesn't it make you like...  That's a nightmare.  Doesn't it make...  Because I'm very careful with shit like that.  Yeah.  Doesn't it make you think, like, wow, I'm really glad I'm careful so far?  There, but for the grace of God go I, as they say.  It's probably so easy to fall into that trap when you have that kind of money.  Right.  It's not easy to fall into that trap. 
[00:53:00]  He went all in.  No one does that.  I'm telling you.  It snowballs.  It's very rare.  I bet it snowballs.  Yeah, I bet Jimmy's right.  If something happens and it snowballs and you don't want to lose five million, so you're  like, oh, no, if I do this, that will cover it and then fix that and then the loan's guaranteed.  But I think his initial investment was pretty much all in, right, Travis?  I think so, yeah.  It wasn't like, okay, look, we're in a situation here.  You're going to have to put more money in.  It sounds like he put all of it in right away.  What a buffoon.  It was a poor financial decision.  Of epic proportions. 
[00:53:30]  And they might have said, dude, you can make 500 million the first day.  Of course.  That's what he was thinking.  Look at Grand Theft Auto.  Oh, God.  I'll become a billionaire.  Yeah.  How much did it sell?  Do we know?  How much did his game sell?  Yeah, like what did it get to?  Oh, God.  You're talking about an athlete, a really good athlete that won't even be a millionaire  now when this is all said and done.  No.  Not even close.  He's so in debt. 
[00:54:00]  He'll be living in Ashland where you used to live.  Imagine.  Hey, I think that's Curt Schilling.  Yo, Curt, you want to throw the ball around?  713 grand.  That was this year.  What?  The game.  Rhode Island nets 713,000 from ongoing kingdom of...  Reckoning sales since the state acquired the assets last summer.  Jesus. 
[00:54:30]  That's nothing.  No.  There are 100 million in debt.  Oh, man.  Almost there.  He's probably going to get kicked out of Massachusetts on top of it.  Right?  I don't know.  Oh, well.  Rock, didn't GTA make 800 million the first day this year?  Some ridiculous number, yeah.  I wonder when he knew that this wasn't going to work, like the first day when they had like  41,000 in sales.  Oof.  All right.  He said, Curt Schilling tweeted that it had sold 1.2 million copies by the 90-day mark. 
[00:55:00]  So let me do some math.  Now, that's probably disastrous for that kind of money, right?  Probably.  Let's see.  Well, the game would be what?  $50?  $50.  $60.  So you're talking $60 million plus you had a little bit on there.  Yeah.  So that's about $72 million.  $72 million?  In 90 days.  That's horrendous.  GTA probably made that in 90 seconds.  Right.  90 days.  Yeah, you're right.  Okay.  90 days.  He made $72 million about. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Rhode Island governor has said that the game was a failure as it needed to sell over 3 million  copies to break even.  Yikes.  They did not break even.  Didn't even break even.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Bye-bye.  All right.  That's why you don't get invested in your hobbies.  No.  No.  No.  We got some Miley Cyrus audio that's really good.  Goody.  She's talking to Matt Lauer about sex. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, a row.  But it's making the rounds, this clip.  It's pretty good.  Row.  She's feisty.  And other things, right?  Sure.  That's what I say.  I'm psyched for Jocktober.  It was fun yesterday.  And then I was driving in.  I guess we had a lot of wind and stuff yesterday.  The storm and everything.  And every time I hear it, somebody said, yeah, and some trees fell on some houses.  I was just like, I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house. 
[00:56:30]  And then, of course, it goes hand in hand with, I'll see the boat move.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  How does he stink?  Oh, that's so bad.  I think I'm going to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  After the show today.  Oh.  It's already out, the boat movie?  No, no.  I got a preview.  Oh, nice.  A preview.  Very cool.  Yeah.  The boat movie.  The Opie and Anthony Show  Sirius XM 
[00:57:00]  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  Selling all your shit  He's the champ of selling your shit  We were going to move on, but we found  Two quick clips of Curt Schilling  On the Sam Roberts Show  Heard exclusively 
[00:57:30]  On the Opie and Anthony Channel  It's big news today  There's an estate sale going down Saturday  In Curt Schilling's actual house  And he's selling all his junk  I mean, we just saw the website  Most of it is junk  Because he owes so much money  Junk  So they're moving in to get as much  As much money as they can  From this guy  Who's now bankrupt because of his video game company  And his video game that went  Went belly up  Yeah, so 
[00:58:00]  But there was a time  Right before the release of the game  Before all this went  Terribly wrong  That he was excited  And looking forward to the future  And the success of the video game  Money's going to be a rolling in  I always enjoyed this  I think all of us have kind of fantasy in our DNA  Whether it be science fiction  But the weird thing is that most of us  Who have fantasy in our DNA  Yeah, my fantasy doesn't involve losing everything  Not a good fantasy right there 
[00:58:30]  Fantasize about being a Major League Baseball pitcher  Or something like that  Generally speaking  Yeah  A giant sports star  Doesn't have to dive into  A different world  He should have  Oh, good fucking point, Sam  He did the warning of Sam Roberts  Right there  I had no idea how smart I was  That's right  Yeah  We keep your fantasy  He's a chick with dicks  Like the rest of us  He's a chick with dicks  He's one of them  I'm just a non-improving idiot  So you were  You were uncomfortable 
[00:59:00]  With this Curt Schilling thing  You're like  Oh my God  What are you doing?  That's what I heard there  What are you doing?  You're a baseball star  Why are you doing this?  Yes, because the whole idea of escaping into fantasy  Is to forget your day-to-day  And you didn't know at the time  That he put all his money in  No, nobody did  No one knew at the time, right?  So you think he might be a spokesperson  And even that  You're like  What are you doing?  You're a baseball guy  Well, I knew that he had an investment  And I knew that he had put a bunch of money into it  I didn't know everything  But yeah, I was sitting there going  You know, you already got to be a pitcher for the Red Sox 
[00:59:30]  Like you already got to be a Major League Baseball star  You got the fantasy part of life  Now just go enjoy it  Stop trying to push the fantasy  Right  I hate you  So  What?  Why you hate me?  What are you talking about?  You just said that  By playing the Curt Schilling clip  Oh, you're talking about  It doesn't have to dive into  It's  A different world  I've never worked a day in my life  I honestly haven't  I've never had to do something  I've always been able to love what it is I do  So  Never too late to start now  Yep 
[01:00:00]  Yep  You're going to be working pretty hard now  He's got his most classified ads  He had it all set up where he would never have to  Oh, man  Why would you screw it up?  To do something  I've always been able to love what it is I do  So  38 Studios was just  It was a stab at being  Trying to be a world champion  I guess it's something else  And something no one gave me a shot at  Something no one  I certainly didn't go in with  Externally high expectations  Yeah  Good  But I've always  I've been a part of three world championship teams 
[01:00:30]  And been able to play around the best players in the world  And I want to take a chance on doing it someplace else  Oh  Well, you did  Hey, take that chance  See what happens  Oh, that's right  Oh  Yeah, if you didn't go in with  Externally high expectations  Maybe  Everything was too much  Yeah  Die  Financially  We got more from the Curt Schilling appearance on Sam's show  Mean  Does it become difficult to be anything but a champion after that? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, it's impossible  Yeah  I mean, it's like my wife runs marathons  And she said, oh, you know, why don't you do this with me?  Sell her sneakers  So let me explain how this works  If I'm halfway through a race and the winner's already finishing  I have no interest in playing  I mean, if I  No, if I don't have a chance to win, I don't want to play  And, you know, I think part of that is what I'm trying to bring to this company  Is making people understand  Limits and capabilities are all self-imposed  Oh  I like to win  I like to  I've certainly lost a lot  But baseball was a great teacher for me 
[01:01:30]  Oh, I'm going to lose more  In the discipline of losing and failing  In baseball, you lose  You win 50, you lose 50 every year  Angry birds, stuffed animal  And then it's the other 62 to kind of determine who wins  50 cents  So losses are kind of an everyday thing  Yeah  You don't accept it  Flintstones, jelly jar glass  75 cents  This is great to listen to  Oh, in hindsight, yes  Loss is a part of life, huh?  Yes  And he says  What's self-imposed?  Hmm  And then it's the other 62 to kind of determine who wins 
[01:02:00]  So losses are kind of an everyday thing  Yeah  You don't accept it, but you understand it's part of life  When I walked away from baseball, you have wins and losses every day  The only way to fail something is to quit  Yep  Right  And I've never quit anything in my life  So this is a, we're in it for the long haul  There are other ways to fail things  In this game, the reviews have been unbelievable  Ah  See, he's thinking like, I'm in  Here's the equivalent of losing in baseball  He plays for a team that goes 0 and 162 
[01:02:30]  That's how bad this loss is  Yes  But every game they lost 1-0  2-1  On a bad call  Right  An error  And he definitely thought that the reviews meant that he was going to sell a lot of games  Because you don't go out and say  I did this so I could be the world champion of something else  No, I don't care about the money  I, you know  I'm sure he had some kind of app on his phone  Like, let's break it down  He's probably somewhere celebrating the release of the game  And just sitting back and waiting for the numbers 
[01:03:00]  Yeah  When do you think he starts sweating?  Five minutes in  Five minutes in?  We sold nine copies  Oh, boy  How many more we need to break even?  Right  2,999,991  Do you think by the end of the night he was out of his mind?  You know, I guarantee they talked about  Dude, you know what?  GTA is an institution  People are used to that  This is going to be word of mouth  This might take it, you know  This is the long haul  Yeah, they had those discussions 
[01:03:30]  Oh, yeah, it's not going to happen overnight  It's okay, though  They probably prepared him for that first  We got a good foothold in the industry  Poor guy  That's amazing  Yeah, in hindsight, it's pretty fucking interesting  To hear him talk about the game like that  He did have some high hopes  He thought he was going to be like  He thought  That he was going to be as successful at video games 
[01:04:00]  If not more than he was at baseball  Oh, yeah  More, yeah  All right, well  Good luck, bro  Paul McCartney's in the building right now  What?  Yeah, I know  What's he doing?  Na, na, na, na  Is he, uh  Is he going to sing?  I don't know  Let's get a guitar in here  I don't know  No one's allowed to see him  Let's drag him in  Get a guitar  Like Paul Williams with the keyboard  That'd be nice  I don't play the keyboard  I don't know 
[01:04:30]  I never learned how to play  How do you not learn how to play the  The long and clang  Clang, clang, clang  Winding  Road turn  Clang, clang, clang  Like, fuck, Paul sucks  Paul Williams could barely find a chord  Yeah  And he wrote a lot of really good songs  Oh, that was terrible  I was hoping he could play  But after all these years  You would think you would just, like  Kind of teach yourself  Or get a few lessons  It's obvious you like music 
[01:05:00]  Just an old-fashioned love song  Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang  Playing on the radio  Clang, clang, clang  That was a weird moment, right?  Finding that out  After we set it up for him nice  I want to see the Matt Lauer clip  So Marley Cyrus is doing her thing  She had a pretty good SNL  Hey, who was  She had a pretty good SNL, man  Who was  Who was  Paul McCartney going on? 
[01:05:30]  Howie  It is Howie?  Yeah, just his show  Jeez  That's it  Sir Paul  Come in, Sir Paul  I guess Howard  Want a kitten?  I was going to say  I guess Howard put the kitten talk aside for a day  So you go back to doing real radio  Your ex-wife could use her leg as a scratching post  For one of the kittens, Robin  Does anyone know about the kitten shit yet?  What is going on over there?  He's trying to reinvent himself 
[01:06:00]  God bless him, but  His wife was on talking about kittens for two hours?  Is that true?  I don't know if it was two hours  I heard two hours  Wow  Yesterday Howard's wife was on his show talking about kittens  I hear there's a clip on SiriusXM  We're allowed to play it if it's on SiriusXM  Yeah  I gotta hear this thing  Yeah, it's on YouTube  That everyone's talking about  Because I heard people like  What the fuck is going on over there?  He's  What is he trying to do? 
[01:06:30]  Reinvent himself?  He's trying to be a nice guy now?  What's his deal?  I think it's nice guy, yeah  Alright  Because from what I hear  The scuttlebutt around the office  Yeah  For the people that interact with them  And the show and stuff  Is that  Yeah, with America's Got Talent  And everything  Change that  Change that attitude  Into a positive  Fun  Family thing  And not so much  The raucous  Perverted  Howard of Old  Well, you can't have the same personality  Throughout your entire career  So people are always adjusting 
[01:07:00]  And reinventing themselves  But  But with him  This is like  Way over the top  This isn't even subtle  I just got word that it was  Over an hour  Over an hour?  He spent over an hour  Talking about kittens?  I suppose  And trying to get people  To adopt them?  I do ten minutes  On Little Beavis  And people want to  Fucking choke me  Not at all, man  I could talk about Beavis  For an hour  It's a delightful animal  But this is a type of radio  I worked at radio stations 
[01:07:30]  Where they sold time  To idiots  On the weekends  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And they would come in  With an idea  Like, well  I want to like  Try to, you know  Get people to adopt  Kittens this weekend  All right  But knowing no one  Would listen to that shit  A no-kill shelter  He's a big show still, right?  Yeah, from what I hear  I think so  This is the clip  That's on the website  Yeah, I mean  It's on YouTube  All right  Because we're not allowed  To play his audio  If we try to search it out  With the company  Right  The company system 
[01:08:00]  Gadgetry  But if this is out there  It's out there  And we're promoting  The new Howard  This is the new Howard  It is  It's his YouTube channel  Let's take a positive spin  On this  Help the company out  A little bit  This is the new Howard  Right  Reinventing himself  With some broad  Who thinks she knows  What the hell she's doing  What is she again?

Yeah  This is the new Howard  We gotta help him out 
[01:09:00]  It's like Howard  Help promote the new Howard  Get your wife on the show  Because she works  With these shelters  And has adopted  Kittens that need to be adopted  You bring her  And the kittens on  And then you talk about it  And your listeners  From the 90's  Want to shoot themselves  In the head  I'll tell you right now  Yeah  I'm pointing at Imus  Don Imus  Who Howard used to make fun of  All the fucking time  And he's becoming more and more  Like Imus every day 
[01:09:30]  And I guarantee you  Fast forward a little bit  And Howard's wife  Will be on the show  As a regular  Like Imus now has  Yeah  What does she know  About fucking radio?  I'm talking about  Imus' wife right now  And we love Imus  Imus looks like  He has a bunch of  Angora kittens on his head  Doesn't he?  He wants Angora kittens  To be adopted  Off of his head  The rest of his body  Is rotting away  But not the hair  That had a hair on him  What genetics  Right  Wow 
[01:10:00]  The rest of his body  Must be turning into  Fertilizer for his hair  Oh yeah  To grow such a head of hair  Alright so this is great  This is the new Howard  And you know  We're company men now  Or at least I am  For SiriusXM  Of course  So we should show the people  What he's up to right?  I mean the company's proud  They put it up on their website  Technically it's his  YouTube channel  Alright let's listen to this  Just a quick clip  Of the hour segment right?  It was over an hour  Okay  The Howard Stern Show  Alright these kittens 
[01:10:30]  Live in my house  I love them all  You know it's very funny  But when my wife  Started doing this  I didn't know how  I'd feel about it  Uh huh  Like my house is just  She would go to  Municipal shelters  Where they were going  To kill these kittens  Because nobody adopts them  Yeah because they  Have too many  And her idea was  I'm going to get them  Out of the kill shelter  And then I'm going  To take them  And I'm going to  Pause  Oh my god  I  I swear to you 
[01:11:00]  I would think  Someone took some audio  And cut this up  As a mashup  Right?  You know  This doesn't sound like  The Howard of old  When you think  This is some goof  That somebody  You know  Went through  Hundreds of hours  Of audio  And cut this up  To make it sound  Like this  What is he doing?  He wants a house  Full of kittens  That need to be adopted  That's great  If that's what you're into  But you don't bring it  To a huge radio show  Or maybe you bring it  To a huge radio show  For a quick  Five minute segment 
[01:11:30]  Supposedly this was an hour  I think his house  Smells like cat peepee now  And what was the  That many cats  You don't watch that  What was the first  Phone call that came in  After the segment?  It was a complaint call  What do you mean?  But he took it  Thinking oh see  A listener call  See the new me  Is doing really well  And I got a phone call  That's going to praise  What I just did  Right?  Yes  Yeah the listener  We've been tricked  By that shit too  But  He tricked him  And what did the guy say?  He started by saying  I just want to say 
[01:12:00]  That was very moving  And then he stopped  His sentence  Right  And told him  What the fuck was that?  Oh boy  Some people  They just can't grow  Can they?  It's not fair man  You got to give Howard  A chance  As he reinvents himself  Yeah  He has nothing to lose  He has so much  God damn money  So  God bless him  Kitty cats  Kitty cats  When you think  In the old days  He would throw kittens  At a stripper or something 
[01:12:30]  Oh that was  Yeah  Yeah  But like  Here's what you would do  You take some bologna  Right  Right  And you smack  A stripper's ass  With the bologna  Yeah  And then you let kittens  Loose so they scratch  And bite at the stripper's ass  And see how long  She can take it  I don't think  I think the days  Of throwing bologna  And naked girls  Is long God  Yeah  All right let's go  I want to hear this  You know  You look at them now  You're like oh my god  They're like the perfect pets  How many have we actually  Placed in homes?

[01:23:00]  Prostituting herself  Wasn't Sinead  Prostituting herself  To make a bunch  Of men  Money  Oh  She's a man hater  She's a man hater  Although also  Sinead is  Apparently she's going  To be going on tour soon  Yeah  For what  So it might be helpful  To get her name out  Yeah of course  To sing her one song  That Prince wrote  That's it  In the end  She had one song  True  Don't even argue this with me  Ladies and gentlemen  And for the fifth time  This evening  Nothing compares to you  The song doesn't sound 
[01:23:30]  As cool  With the new  The current version  Of her singing it  By the way  No  There was almost  Something kind of  Innocent and sexy  Angelic  Yeah thank you  It has an angelic  Quality to it  Hold on  Could you put  A recent picture  Of Sinead O'Connor  Oh god  This is what you would see  As she's singing this song  Tell me it still works  Uh oh  Oh fuck  Okay there you go  That's not even current

I think she's a lesbian  I thought so too  But apparently she  You know  Maybe she's not  Maybe we shouldn't be saying that today  Just write a song about it  Jesus  Yeah  It's gotta be a fake tattoo  It looks like somebody  Like  She took a red pen  And drew on her face  I'll send you the link

[01:30:00]  An act for you know  Just publicity  And it's  It's working for her  It's working out perfectly  Somewhere  They went behind closed doors  And said look  Like you know  Act like a hero  Like Howard's doing with kittens  Miley decided  Look I gotta reinvent myself  As well  And they came up with this  Like look  You gotta throw that  Fucking goody two shoe  Shit out the window  I like Tana Montana  And  You know  She's nice  She had the long hair  Like a girl  But then  You know  You go out there  Over the top sexual

[01:31:30]  Jocktober next?  Yes  Who the fuck doesn't  Right?  Right  Jocktober  Can't wait to see  The boat movie later  So psyched  I want to see the boat movie  I do  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  Boat movie  I want to see the boat movie  Doesn't that sound like  Somebody should be wearing  A hockey helmet  And you have to tell them  To calm down  We're gonna go see the boat movie  Don't worry  It just sounds like a fucking dope from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's the type of thing somebody says while they're sitting there throwing fucking food in a restaurant with no connection to a film at all.  I'm going to see the boat movies.  Just eat your fries, dope.  They have to now pick apart gravity.  Oh, like science-wise?  They're like, well, that wouldn't happen.  Who did the article that got a lot of heat on Twitter?  Or, Neil, what's his name there?  There's a whole bunch of facts that are wrong with gravity. 
[01:32:30]  Well, what are you going to do?  The best one is that Sandra Bullock's hair isn't, like, floating.  This guy had a problem with the fact that her hair wasn't, you know, floating in space.  Remember when Sally Ride went up in the fucking shuttle?  And you were like, holy shit, what happened to her hair?  Because it would just be all sticking up.  Right.  It's crazy.  We're used to those crew-cut dudes being up there for the space program for so many years that when they sent a broad up, her hair looked all funny. 
[01:33:00]  Now you understand why they did the crew cut.  Right.  They didn't want to look silly in space.  You don't want to look silly.  You got to buzz that down like John Glenn.  That's right.  Yes.  Tight.  Keep it tight.  See?  See, her hair's not floating.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the big problem.  It looked sensible.  They had with the movie.  What else did they, what were the other problems with the movie?  I guess there was a problem that, if she's a doctor.  Yeah.  I didn't believe that either.  And George Clooney has to explain to her about oxygen deprivation. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And the effects thereof.  And it's like, well, if she's a doctor, why is George Clooney explaining that?  I don't know why they went with that angle.  That was a little strange.  A little odd, huh?  Right.  Because they needed George Clooney to be, like, her hero.  Well, that's true.  They also needed exposition for the audience.  They had to tell the audience certain things, too.  Like, how are we supposed to know that unless somebody in the movie explains it?  That's true.  Oh, my God.  They were just winging through space with a bunch of debris.  And there was one part where they said, like, when he was hanging on, like, well,  I don't want to give anything away. 
[01:34:00]  There's one thing where if, I don't want to blow anything, but if something got pulled  a certain way, he would have just snapped back or she would have just snapped back  instead of—  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  And without any gravity, you will move at the same amount of energy as being put against  you as you're putting out against something else.  Right.  So it's very hard to stop yourself in space or throw something. 
[01:34:30]  If you throw something, you'll be propelled in the opposite direction.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, because you don't really have a—there's no friction with the ground or gravity holding  you in place.  You'll be propelled.  Yeah, very odd.  Well, there is gravity.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there's gravity from the Earth.  90 percent.  You're at 90 percent gravity.  But relative to—what, they're at 90 percent gravity?  When you're in space, they feel 90 percent of the gravity that we deal with.  Really?  Yeah.  Ooh.  But again, the falling is the only reason that happens, but— 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, they're constantly falling around the planet.  But there's a fucking—I was amazed to read that.  That's crazy.  90 percent.  That's frightening.  Being with us, appreciate it.  Good to see it.  Got an asteroid on set.  How can you go wrong?  We're going to take a quick—  Ah, we missed it.  They were just discussing the same thing we were.  Ooh.  Hey, what's that?  With that big bitch.  She would do well in space.  Why do you say that?  I don't know.  A lot of mass.  A lot of mass.  People would travel to her.  Yeah.  Critical gridlock.  Oh, that's not ending anytime soon. 
[01:35:30]  No kidding, huh?  They're going to play it out.  Hey, gals.  Hey, there's the famous TV star.  I saw him on fucking—  Oh, Rich?  —TV.  SNY?  Yeah?  Can we tell him he needs to look at a camera?  Would that be mean?  Oh, my God.  Did you—  Did you see that?  I was watching last night.  I wish him well, but—  He's looking back and forth.  What do you look at the camera?  He's looking at, what, Covino?  Yeah.  And then he looks at the camera for a second, and then back—  He doesn't know where to look.  Dude, I was noticing the exact same thing. 
[01:36:00]  I'm like, he doesn't know where to look.  He looks a little uncomfortable.  He's new.  He's new to the whole thing.  That's funny.  Maybe we're just jealous.  We don't have a TV show.  Well, we don't.  That's really funny.  He was just going back and forth, like, what is he looking at?  Or not.  Pick something and look at it.  What do you got, though?  Let's do some Jocktober after the break.  Oh, please.  That sound good.  Oh, yes. 
[01:36:30]  Suck on this, you fuck pig.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  And now, The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Beyond hilarious, but also depressing as all hell, that a voice like that is silenced.  God.  The great Patrice O'Neil.  Fucking hilarious.  He lives on with his bits, that's for sure. 
[01:37:00]  Holy fuck.  Did he give us some good times?  All right.  Are we going to delve into a bit of Jocktober?  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions.  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid. 
[01:37:30]  Jocktober.  O.M.G.  Hosts.  Holes.  Bits.  And Stunt Boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for...  Jocktober.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  Bolt movie.  People are very angry at pontificating proportions.  Why?  It doesn't make sense.  So, uh, Mike, Stunt Brain, said something.  And then another listener tweeted something and said, pontificating, there isn't such thing 
[01:38:00]  as pontificating proportions.  Wait a minute.  Did it say pontificating, oh yeah, proportions of something?  Of pontificating proportions.  Oh yeah, that's stupid.  That doesn't make sense.  Who put that together and thought pontificating meant, like, big or monumental or a lot?  It doesn't sound cool, though.  Well, it does, but you could have come up with another word for big.  Yeah.  That kind of sounds like pontificating. 
[01:38:30]  Oh boy, we're going to Cincinnati today.  Cincinnati, Ohio.  We're going to say hi to...  WKRP.  Oh no.  Oh, X.  We're going to Q102 in Cincinnati.  Jeff and Jenny.  Oh no.  I don't know if you need to say it with such an attitude.  Jeff and Jenny.  Jeff and Jenny.  Are our focus today.  Wait, he's doing a show with two broads.  With Jeff and Jen.  Oh.  Oh, who's the other broad?  Oh, I saw the exclamation point. 
[01:39:00]  I thought that was an I.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, it's Jeff and Jen.  Jeff and Jen.  Oh, it's the ampersand.  With some other chick.  Yeah.  With some other...  Oh, man.  This guy's sandwiched between two holes on the show?  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  What's better than one hole?  Ah, two.  Come on now.  Oh, now.  Hey, can we do hole day?  I was thinking about that.  Oh, that's a good thing.  I was thinking about it at the gym.  Just one day where it's just holes.  Just feature various holes from around the country.  Oh, yes.  That is a good one.  That would be lovely. 
[01:39:30]  Maybe the listeners could help you out.  Yeah, we could.  I just monitor different shows every day.  I mean, we don't remember.  But maybe the listeners.  It's not Sam on Twitter.  They find a quick clip of a hole in their market and they could send it in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And maybe we could put a day of holes together.  Oh, easily.  Can we try that?  Sure.  Because we are trying to mix it up a little bit this Jocktober.  Yeah.  Do you think they ruin the shows?  Oh, my God.  But you guys don't know if Jen and the other chick are holes.  That's true.  Oh, my God.  It's a guarantee.  Why do you say that? 
[01:40:00]  Because.  Is it because he's sandwiched between them with his arms folded?  Yes.  Yeah, like, I'm trying to get away with stuff, but I can't with these two around me.  That's right.  And they're sitting there going, we're here to have fun, but not too much fun.  You know.  No, it's fun like us ladies like to have fun.  Right, girls?  Yeah.  Give me some basic facts before we start playing the clips.  Jeff and Jen, Q102 in Cincinnati.  Yeah, they do the morning show over there on Q102. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  They play the hits.  Okay.  What kind of hits, though?  Hits without the rap or all the hits?  They don't even have.  I mean, today's Twerk Tuesday.  Today's Twerk Tuesday?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy.  And what does that do?  What are they?  They're not twerking.  Oh, that's fun, though.  Oh, boy.  Today's Twerk Tuesday.  Oh, and they show Miley.  Well, yeah, Twerk Tuesday.  What happens on Twerk Tuesday?  They just say that? 
[01:41:00]  You can win a download code for the new Miley Cyrus album every hour today.  Wow.  But what is the Twerk Tuesday part?  I guess Miley Cyrus twerks, and it's an alliteration.  So they just came up with something, but there's nothing behind it?  No.  It just sounds cool to say it's Twerk Tuesday on Q102?  Yes.  Here in Cincinnati?  Yes.  Oh.  What else they got?  The bosom ball is coming out.  What is the bosom ball?  I really don't want to say what woman is singing. 
[01:41:30]  I'm assuming it's to fight breast cancer.  Ah.  Yeah.  That's a good cause.  We could all agree with that.  Yeah, of course.  What was the show?  Was it last year where that broad put together all the women in a hotel?  Does anyone else remember that?  That was one of my favorite Jocktobers ever.  They had the women convention.  Oh, my God.  These chicks are big.  Jen, alarm clock app.  Yes.  What is the alarm clock app?  What does that do?  Well, you can wake up and get instant access to your favorite morning show, weather, and more. 
[01:42:00]  Wow.  Pretty handy.  They have a fucking app.  Oh, yeah.  What else?  Basic knowledge.  I mean, that's it.  They're an adult, I would say, oriented.  A lot of soccer moms listening.  Any bios?  Yeah, we love the bios.  I like a good bio.  We love the radio.  And this is where I just keep referring to not Jen as the girl who's not Jen because she's not in the bio.  Oh, boy.  Jeff and Jen have been waking up Cincinnati since 2002. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  11 years.  You'd think that between the two of them, plus Fritch.  Is that Fritch?  Fritch?  Is that her name?  Fritch?  I guess.  She's as big as a fridge.  She likes going to the fridge.  She is a fatty.  Oh, God.  Sometimes we decide not to be subtle.  I know.  Fuck it.  Some days it's all in.  Fuck it.  You'd think there would be... 
[01:43:00]  Phase one initiated, by the way.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Yeah, everyone's on to us now.  Yeah.  I've heard they have meetings now about Jack Tolber.  Yeah.  Whew.  Now, I'm not saying we're going to be featured.  Just in case.  We've got to be on this.  We need a contingency plan.  That's right.  I got emailed a copy of an email that radio people are being sent.  Ah.  To be on the lookout for Jack Tolber.  Yeah, I know.  Bolo.  What did it say?  It just said it didn't give the Opie and Anthony show credit.  It acted like there were a group of cyber hackers. 
[01:43:30]  Terrorists.  Terrorists.  Radio terrorists.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Look out.  Yeah.  But they say, you know, they've been waking up in Cincinnati since 2002.  You'd think between the two of them, plus Fritch, that there would be quite a few cups  of coffee in the studio.  Imagine fucking a Fritch.  Oh, Fritch.  Fritch.  Oh, Fritch.  Suck my dick, Fritch.  Fritch.  It's like you're fucking asking one of your college frat buddies. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  That's a frat buddy nickname.  Yes.  Oh, me and Fritch when Al Esa got fucking hammered.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Fritch took a shit in a glove compartment.  Fritch.  I'm going to come, Fritchie.  Fritchie.  Yeah.  A little info on each of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But when they're not with Q, that's the name of the station.  Oh.  Fritch loves taking in everything Cincinnati has to offer.  Everything.  Every restaurant has to offer.  From going to Bengals and Reds games to enjoying summer concerts at Riverbend, she especially 
[01:44:30]  loves her Skyline.  Extra hot sauce, please.  All right.  A little local reference.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just described a regular person.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Who doesn't go to sporting events and concerts in their city?  Well, that's why you listen to her because she's a regular gal.  Oh.  We'll wait till you find out.  Jen.  Yeah.  Uh, you'll find Jen most often hanging out with her awesome son, Jacob, or working on  her many hidden talents, which include tap dancing, belting out show tunes. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, boy.  She's Gregory Hines.  Oh, boy.  Fitting her whole fist in her mouth.  All right.  All right.  How about mine?  Yeah.  Shut up.  And knowing the number of every value meal at McDonald's, Arby's, and Wendy's. 
[01:45:30]  It's all about eating and fucking.  So she's proud of her chub.  Oh.  What did you hear about Jeff?  A self-professed foodie.  Roll in.  Jeff's favorite place in Cincinnati is the chef's table at Boca.  Oh.  Besides his love for food, he also possesses an uncanny sense of direction.  What? 
[01:46:00]  Wow.  You can drop me anywhere in the country blindfolded, he says.  And I'll find...  It was just going to be another rest area joke.  I saved us all the trouble.  I don't like that.  He says, I'll always find my way back.  Sounds like a challenge.  It does.  That's not me iterating that.  That was the bio.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, that tells us a lot about...  Jeff and Jen.  And Frits.  That's it.  And Frits.  Yeah.  I guess her name's Frits.  Well, why don't we dive right in and hear a little bit of... 
[01:46:30]  Sure, all right.  Well, the Jeff and Jen show on Q102 in Cincinnati.  We start with time to play fake or for real.  Fake or for real.  Fake or for real.  Everybody, we're going to play a game.  Hey, job or no job.  Did he find his facts machine?  I don't know for sure if he did or not.  He's still looking for a gig, though.  I see that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He needs a gig.  Poor Scorch.  Just how this one's played.  What do you mean?  Like, can you guess, based on the insanely original title, fake or for real, how the game 
[01:47:00]  is played?  All right.  Is this story fake or for real?  All right.  You got it.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  What do they do with limbs?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  At Cincinnati's Q102.  Let's play it around, a fake or for real.  Oh, Jesus.  With that...  This is torture.  Like, radio could be the easiest gig in the world.  Why make it shitty?  It's got all the features, too.  The bad background music.  Everything needs a bed.  Everything needs a wacky, goofy kind of bed. 
[01:47:30]  Everything needs a bed.  Everything needs a name.  Yeah, a name.  And we're going to phrase it like everybody knows what it is.  Around, fake or for real.  Here's fake or for real.  You know, you played it before with us.  You know the music.  You got to make believe it's fun, even though you know it's shitty.  It sucks.  Just getting it to the next Miley Cyrus song.  It's one twerking Tuesday.  And Cincinnati's Q102.  Let's play it around, a fake or for real.  Three headlines here.  Tell us which one is real, and we're going to send you to the Children's Theater performance 
[01:48:00]  of Andy Jr.  Yay!  It's not for you, Uncle Paul.  I like the Children's Theater.  Yeah?  All the adults have face masks on.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  I like when they perform all Calcutta.  Yeah.  Or the original Broadway production of Hair.  Yeah, we do.  I'm hairless.  Oh, this stinks. 
[01:48:30]  This is terrible.  To the Children's Theater performance of Andy Jr. at the Tap Theater.  Here we go.  We're doing tickets to Andy Jr.  She loves tap.  How much could the tickets cost?  Seven bucks?  You're winning tickets to the Children's Theater production of Andy Jr.  What is Andy Jr.?  They all play like, it's like Archie Kids?  Yeah, Archie Kids, Flintstone Kids.  It's like, it's a tap thing, I think she said.  Yeah.  Well, she's into tap dancing. 
[01:49:00]  She loves the tap dancing.  I like times that my fly and say, give Daddy Warbucks a kiss.  It's not even a little subtle anymore.  We decide not to be subtle today.  It's a hard cock life, Mike.  Yeah, sun will come out tomorrow, but for now it's the daughter.  Get over here.  Let me make love to your mouth.  Holy fuck.  It's just wrong. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  All right, let's continue.  All right, here we go.  Is it A, a groom forgets to book his wedding venue, so he calls in a bomb threat on the  wedding day to get the place shut down.  Oh, I don't like that.  Is it B, a woman leaves a purse filled with cocaine at a footlocker and is arrested when  she comes back to get it?  No.  Wow.  Or see a man escapes from prison and goes straight to another prison that's closer to his family.  All right.  Dollar 20 gets a guess.  I'm going to say it's definitely not the last one because that's right. 
[01:50:00]  That's too, too, like a real obvious.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with the what's the first cocaine in the footlocker or what was the first one?  Do we have to find out the answer?  Yeah.  Unfortunately, they received no calls.  So that was the end of real and for fate.  They never gave the real answer.  They've been doing radio for 12 years.  Oh, my God.  In that city.  During spots, they're like, blow it off, blow it off.  We didn't get any calls.  Yeah, that was the end of real. 
[01:50:30]  You're kidding, right?  Did they say that they didn't get calls or they just moved on?  So they made believe that didn't happen.  They just pretended that that was in my imagination.  Oh, that's wow.  Brilliant.  They said, we'll give it to the 20th caller.  Oh, they came back.  No, they said it in that clip.  They go 20th caller.  We'll get the chance to win.  Wow.  20 callers.  They didn't get one.  Oh, God.  That's a lofty goal, getting 20 phone calls.  That went nowhere for them.  Very good. 
[01:51:00]  So, yeah, I'm sorry.  I should have interrupted you earlier, but there's no reason for you guys to try to figure that out.  All right.  We will not be getting the answer.  Good.  Okay.  Well, we're going to move on then with Jeff and Jen.  CQ102 in Cincinnati.  Why is there a picture of a woman, and she's topless, she's holding her tits, and on her  chest it says aborted, on her right tit it says Hitler, and on her left tit it says cock.  Aborted Hitler cock.  That's not nice.  Seems to be a little harsh.  Well, I don't know why there are photos of Jim Chandler surfacing on this Facebook page. 
[01:51:30]  That's weird.  The hidden picture doesn't look well, either.  Oh.  Is that doody falling out of a hiney?  Who posted that?  Oh.  Daniel Curlin.  That's, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, no.  Photo.  Oh, no.  Jesus.  Jaws.  Jaws.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  They got a horrendous Facebook page.  Wow.  Facebook allows this? 
[01:52:00]  Oh, there's a black, a naked black guy fucking a bucket of KFC.  Why are the pictures always different?  Oh.  You never see a double.  No.  They're always finding great shit.  Amazing.  One of my favorite things the whole time.  Hey, I did this for you.  Yes.  There's Hulk.  The Hulk Hogan again.  Kicking down the towers.  Where are you going?  I did this for you.  Oh, gosh.  That's terrible.  Oh, God.  This is.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, look. 
[01:52:30]  It's young Sam Roberts.  Yeah, there's me.  Well, there's Iraq.  Iraq is.  Is he here today?  Oh.  Iraq.  You're here today.  You see the Facebook?  Iraq.  Oh, that's not nice.  Iraq.  All right.  We'll wait.  Oh.  Some idiot thinks I have something to do with that.  I don't.  You fucking cunt.  Whoa.  To do with what?  That's why we're not talking about it.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh.  Stupid fucking douche.  When Iraq wants to talk about it, he'll talk about us.  Iraq.  Damn. 
[01:53:00]  I supposedly had a meeting and made sure that, yeah, we didn't talk about us.  Did you?  Oh.  Why'd you have that happen?  I was horrible.  Just fucking dicks.  Photo of intern David with a mustache and a wizard hat on.  A wizard hat.  All right.  Well, it seems like their Facebook page is another Iraq phone number picture.  I love the Iraq phone number photo.  Now I do, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  What's next since that failed miserably? 
[01:53:30]  Well, their little game failed.  Yeah.  Even they said, you know how to play.  So they have played this game before.  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah.  I think their prize was shitty.  What was the prize again?  The fucking kids theater tap dancing fucking Annie Jr.  True.  Yeah.  It sucked.  Great price.  Jeff's got an unbelievable, interesting story about Starbucks.  The Paul Williams Army.  It says Paul Williams Army, nigga.  And it's a picture of Paul Williams. 
[01:54:00]  All right.  Well.  Our fan base has to turn into the Paul Williams Army.  Oh, yeah.  We love Paul Williams.  We love Paul Williams.  The Paul Williams Army.  We're going to get the piano lessons for Christmas.  That's hilarious.  Jeff's got an unbelievably interesting story about Starbucks.  Oh.  Want to hear it?  Yeah.  And there are a ton of people out there who consider the Starbucks pumpkin spice latte  one of the best parts of fall.  So let's hope this doesn't ruin it for you.  Oh, it is good.  You should know.  There's no. 
[01:54:30]  There's the whole.  Oh, that whole voice.  Oh, it is good.  Oh, it's so good.  It's Dennis Fjord.  Dennis Falcone.  Yeah, there's a Dennis Fuhrer.  A photo of Hitler with his hand up giving the salute with a swastika, of course, emblazoned  on his arm.  However, Denny has photoshopped his head over the Hitler face.  Big smile.  And it says Dennis Fuhrer.  Dennis Fuhrer.  That's funny. 
[01:55:00]  All right.  Oh, actual pumpkin in the pumpkin spice latte.  What do you mean?  It tastes like it.  Oh, my God.  Once again, we need your help.  We want to do a whole day where we just feature the whole.  So we need you guys to monitor some fucking local radio and send in some clips.  All right.  Send it to NotSam on Twitter.  And this woman misunderstood because she likes a bumpkin.  A bumpkin.  A bumpkin.  I meant to say bumpkin.  A bumpkin. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, I am a bumpkin.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  Oh, boo.  A bumpkin.  Boo.  Good.  You should know there's no actual pumpkin in the pumpkin spice latte.  What do you mean?  It tastes like it.  The flavor actually comes from cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and a pumpkin pie flavored syrup.  Syrup?  Syrup, yeah.  Yeah, it's all the shit that makes pumpkin taste good.  Pumpkin sucks unless you spice it up. 
[01:56:00]  What?  There's a warning of a Denny Nado on there.  Denny Nado.  There's a tornado with Denny's face on it.  I love that Dennis Falcone has become the face of Jack Tover.  He's the man.  Oh, yeah.  Pie flavored syrup?  Syrup, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What do you know?  Which is actually made of chemicals and spices, but no real pumpkin.  Isn't that amazing how they can simulate it, though?  Almost exactly the taste of pumpkin without using pumpkin?  That's a letdowner technology.  What was the hole for? 
[01:56:30]  Wait, what did she say that for?  I don't know.  That's just a noise she makes.  Yes.  It's the noise of the hole.  Like, who cares if there's not real pumpkin crammed into this drink at Starbucks?  Hard drive of pre-teens.  Dennis Falcone.  Dennis Falcone's hard drive of pre-teens.  What a goofy smile.  Oh, that's a good one.  We got some funny listeners, man.  There's a picture of a hard drive, and the word pre-teens is written in, like, cum. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, God.  The cum font.  Opie, you're exactly right, though.  Pumpkin, if you just took a spoonful of pumpkin out of a pumpkin and ate it, it wouldn't taste like pumpkin pie.  The reason it tastes like pumpkin pie is all the shit they put in it, and that's the shit they're putting in the fucking dumb coffee to make it taste like that.  So why is this a story?  Why is it even a story?  No one takes a pumpkin and cut it up and eats slices, because it's shitty.  Why did she do that?  Can we hear that again?  You can simulate it, though, almost exactly the taste of pumpkin without using pumpkin. 
[01:57:30]  That's a letdown, though.  Why is it so stupid?  The angle is, wait a minute, has anyone actually ever tasted pumpkin?  Right.  Because the answer would be no.  Yeah, put some pumpkin in your coffee and tell me how much better it is, you dummy.  No one sits around and eats pumpkin.  Some asshole figured out if you put a bunch of spices together, it could be tasty.  A dog fucking a girl.  What kind of fucking radio station is this?  It's just terrible.  There's another photo of Denny.  It's terrible.  The caption says, I don't always do shitty radio, but when I do, actually, I always do shitty radio. 
[01:58:00]  Why would she be let down?  Because it wasn't...  Who gives a fuck?  Who cares?  Oh!  That's a letdown!  But the point would be that that means she tried...  She likes pumpkin, but no one likes pumpkin.  No.  Of course not.  We invented pumpkin flavor.  Yes.  But it's all that spice shit.  Oh!  Oh, no.  That's exactly the taste of pumpkin without using pumpkin.  That's a letdown, though. 
[01:58:30]  Modern technology.  I don't think you're drinking it for the health factor of...  No.  You're not.  That's true.  That doesn't matter.  Any more than people...  What happened?  What happened?  I can't even say it.  It's so offensive, I can't even say it.  Wait, you're tongue-tied on something offensive?  That's a really, really bad one.  Holy shit.  Oh, it's hilarious.  They allow this on their Facebook page? 
[01:59:00]  I don't know what promotion they were running.  Oh, my God.  How do we explain...  How do you explain this one?  You can't.  You really can't.  That's just offensive.  It's really...  That one's in poor taste.  Wow.  The guy with the garden hose.  There's no reason for that.  Yeah.  For the people playing along, it's the one with the hose.  Okay.  Oh, Pete and Anthony Nugget.  Oh, there's shit coming out.  This is terrible. 
[01:59:30]  Hitler in a gangster wearer.  Oh, these are marvelous.  Oh, Jesus.  Go back.  That's a giraffe neck.  A little promo photo.  They officially made my neck into a giraffe neck.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  You guys are funny.  Oh, these are great.  Dude, we have so many more clips.  Let's get to the end of this one.  Tim Sabian says, Jacktober approved. 
[02:00:00]  And then there's a lot of boat movie posters.  There's a picture of Tim giving the devil horns.  Yeah.  Rumor has it now that he's working for us or with us.  He's, you know, doesn't know how to say his name on the other place.  At the other place.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that's funny shit.  How are you using pumpkin?  That's a letdown, though.  Modern technology.  It's amazing.  I don't think you're drinking it for the health factor of...  No.  You're not.  That's true.  Does it matter?  Any more than people actually go to Starbucks for coffee.  It's so good, though. 
[02:00:30]  That's why I go to Starbucks.  Wow.  For coffee.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  For coffee.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's got his deep radio guy voice.  Awful.  Yeah.  Poor guy.  I just feel bad for the guy.  What are those ladies laughing in this situation?  Why are those ladies laughing?  In this situation.  It's good natured.  But why?  Why are they laughing?  Just to push the whole thing forward.  Oh, yeah.  They were just talking about Starbucks.  Well, that was an unbelievably interesting story about Starbucks. 
[02:01:00]  Thank you, Sam, for bringing that to our attention.  You're welcome.  As we take a look at Q102 in Cincinnati for Jocktober today, Jeff and Jen.  I want the Jeff and Jen alarm.  Well, what does it sound like?  You can download it.  I'm sure it's just the show that comes up.  Oh, you think it's just like a clock radio?  Jeff has a story about men.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  A photo of the guy from the public access show we were watching.  And they were all, come to the cab, all right? 
[02:01:30]  Is that me?  It looks like you could be fucking a pumpkin.  Yeah, it looks like someone fucking a pumpkin.  No, that's not me.  Oh, God.  Jeez.  Yeah.  I mean, this Facebook.  You have some of these Facebook postings.  There's some angry people out there today.  But they have a lot of fans.  They're really good.  Yes.  Because, I mean, they just keep posting and posting.  David again.  They love David.  I love that one.  Well, somebody's Facebook name is actually David Fried. 
[02:02:00]  And we never gave out the Facebook page, so I guess this has to be their listeners.  This is their listeners.  Yes.  It's just one after another.  Picture of Chip.  That's great.  That's good.  All right, here we go.  Jeff has a story about men being better drivers than?  Women.  You got it, Jim Norton.  The girls are all like, I don't think so. 
[02:02:30]  Now, look out.  I don't think so.  It's two against one here, honey.  Look out.  Here is the latest blow in the endless battle over who's better at driving, men or women.  The judge has officially ruled that men are better.  Of course, the judge happens to be a man, but I'm sure he was completely impartial.  Javier Albar is a judge in northern Spain.  He was ruling on a discrimination case where a company was offering driving lessons to men for $900 and to women for $1,170. 
[02:03:00]  The company said they were charging women more because female students needed an average of five more classes than male students before they were ready to get their driver's license.  Oh, please.  Oh, God.  Oh, please.  I wish they would now do a story on who makes better rapists.  Holy shit.  But this is good nature. 
[02:03:30]  This is some good natured fun, guys.  Oh, the battle between men and women.  Who's the better driver?  Oh, please.  Oh, please.  Keeping it light and fun, you know.  Yeah.  They were ready to get their driver's license.  This is crazy.  Crap.  I agree.  The company was fined $5,500 for sex discrimination.  Uh-huh.  So they fought it and went to court, and last week, the judge overturned the fine because he said there is statistical proof that men really are better drivers than women. 
[02:04:00]  There you go.  He cited official traffic statistics from the Spanish government and said every single year, men display greater dexterity and better open road skills.  Whatever.  Yeah.  That's in Spain.  I don't know about that survey.  Maybe Spanish men.  I don't know.  Spanish men are sexy because they're just such a good driver.  That's right.  What?  Oh, my goodness. 
[02:04:30]  Jesus Christ.  This is going great.  Takes you to a story.  I wish gender destroys a radio show better.  That's exactly what they...  Oh.  Oh, no.  That's crap.  I guess the guy thinks...  And their punchline was, oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, the dude did just get over saying that he thought Spanish dudes were sexy.  Well, yes, he did.  I can argue with that point, Sam.  Oh, my goodness.  Time to play.  Time to play.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Yes or BS?  Isn't that fake or real?  Well, I'm glad you brought that up because, yes, it's just like fake or for real.  Come on.  But this time they get a caller.  So they just changed the name of the contest.  Fake or for real is the same thing.  But that failed.  So they decided to just change the name of the contest.  Right.  Do it in the second hour.  Make it a little more edgy.  Right.  Right.  And they did get a phone call, which is very good news for Jeff and Jen at Q102 in Cincinnati. 
[02:05:30]  Fritch.  Yvonne, welcome to Jeff and Jen's Government Shutdown.  Yes or BS?  How are you doing this morning?  Great.  How are you guys?  Excellent.  Doing good.  This is a true-false kind of quiz here, and you just got to get the best out of five.  Dumb bed.  You've been watching a lot of the news about the shutdown?  Not really.  I mainly rely on you guys for all my...  Oh, then you might be in trouble.  Well, we're sorry about that.  Look out.  They're wild.  Because we're uninformed. 
[02:06:00]  That one's accurate.  Oh, that was terrible.  Then you might be in trouble.  Well, we're sorry about that.  Well, we're sorry about that.  What are you?  All right.  Yes or BS?  Every single president since Gerald Ford went through a government shutdown.  Yes or BS?  BS!  That is BS.  Hmm.  But not all that far off.  All of them except for George W.  Oh, look at that.  He was the only one that didn't. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Yes or BS?  During the shutdown, you can still get into the Smithsonian if you show security a picture  of Miley Cyrus spanking a huge teddy bear.  Oh.  Oh.  Yes.  That is BS.  Oh, I thought it was yes.  It's completely shut down, right?  It's completely shut down.  Yep.  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  This is the point of Jack Tolber.  They do five questions.  Yes.  Yes.  Where it just gets tiring.  Yep.  We lose all the energy quickly. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, God.  Now we're stuck listening to this shit.  I know.  Yes or BS?  Yes.  Well, the thrilling conclusion, Anthony.  Thank God.  To yes or BS with the announcement of the grand prize.  Oh, what is the prize?  Do you want me to tell you?  Do you want me to spoil it or do you want to find out?  I want to find out.  Okay, good.  I want to find out.  Good.  Yes or BS?  You get this one right, you win.  It's that easy.  The government shut down every year while President Reagan was in office.  BS.  You're right.  Oh. 
[02:07:30]  That is BS, but it's very close to true.  Every single one is BS.  Yeah, there was a moment where I doubted myself.  Oh, really?  Sexually?  Yeah, it shut down every year except for 1985 and 1988, but every other year.  Yep.  Wow.  People forget that about President Reagan's years, I think.  Huh.  Yeah, so you win.  All right.  We'll hook you up and send you to a children's theater performance of Annie Jr.  Oh, it's the same shitty prize.  Oh, the same shitty prize of Annie Jr. 
[02:08:00]  A stupid sponsor that needs help with tickets.  We've got to give away these Annie Jr. tickets.  Oh, my God.  Because that will get everyone calling about the show, and we'll do well.  Oh, what the fuck?  We couldn't give away these tickets.  Wow.  Well, I guess that's it for today.  Are you sure?  What?  You want more?  Well, is there anything that's not one of their fucking contests?  Well, the gang talks about why you shouldn't eat before surgery.  See, I like when they just riff.  Okay.  The girl who isn't Jen, that's Fritsch, brings up her breast reduction surgery. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, no.  Big, old, fat tits.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  I'm going, why would you?  On all days to bring that up, the day I'm listening, why would you?  Is it good?  I haven't heard this yet.  Go for it.  Okay.  Chances are, whatever your job is, whatever you do, you are probably an expert at it,  or at least pretending to be. 
[02:09:00]  But out of curiosity, what could we all do to make your job easier for you?  There was a discussion.  Why are you laughing?  Easier for you.  There was nothing funny about that.  Just noise.  That's the job of the whole, is to just make noise.  Noise filler.  Yuck.  There was a discussion about this online over the weekend where people talked about the 
[02:09:30]  one little thing people could do to make their jobs easier.  Yeah.  And here are some of the best ones.  Surgeons said, really, and I'm not kidding, don't eat or drink before your surgery.  You're told that all the time.  Yeah.  Some people do it.  If there is food in your stomach, there is a possibility you'll have reflux and choke  when they take out the breathing tube.  That's why.  Yeah.  I never knew that that was why.  I never knew that.  Shut up. 
[02:10:00]  Wait.  Fritch.  That's why.  Fritch.  Fritch.  Fritch.  How do we know she wasn't a man?  A man at some point.  That voice.  She kind of has like a, that's why.  I never knew.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I'm going to see the boat movie today.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie. 
[02:10:30]  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to show my pecker at the boat movie.  I never knew that that was why.  I never knew that either.  I thought they were just trying to save me trips to the bathroom.  No, when I went in for my breast reduxion surgery, I asked my mom, I'm like, I am dehydrated.  I need something.  And she's like, no, you can't do it because there's a chance that you'll choke out.  Well, now that I know, I won't be so upset about it. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, look out.  How much breast meat do they take?  Yeah.  How much tittage?  How much of the sweater meat?  Where is she?  Are there any, like, quality pictures of her?  Yeah.  Where is that bitch?  Yeah.  All right, we can end here.  No, a little more.  A little more?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Remember just yesterday?  People have been tagging their Facebook, and so when you click photos of Jeff and Jen, you 
[02:11:30]  get pictures of Bobo.  Bobo.  Drake, come on.  A chick with a dick.  A cow with a little extra.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, are they going to be surprised?  I've got a boat on my house.  I've got a boat on my house.  Jesus.  Some of these are so offensive.  Is he rocking his phone? 
[02:12:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's bad.  Well, remember yesterday?  Uh-huh.  We asked a very simple question.  Yeah.  Who uses prep burger bits?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Remember that?  Yes.  Well, this show uses the prep burger bits.  Are we about to hear something we played yesterday?  Uh, it's not what we heard yesterday, but you can tell listening to it.  It's a prep burger bit. 
[02:12:30]  Absolutely.  All right.  Okay.  It's Jeff and Jen, CQ102 in Cincinnati being featured today on Jocktober.

Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I'd say.  That was a good one.  It's difficult.  Speaking of prep burger, I hope the people didn't forget, we're accepting Monday songs.  Oh, yeah.  They remember.  Oh, yeah.  They remembered.  I was in communication with someone last night who I tried to call, but he was making  his Monday song.  Was it Coke Logic?  It certainly was.  We got it already, right?  Yep.  Oh, you sent it.  You sent it.  Okay.  Should we play it just as an example of what we're looking for?  Yeah, we can.  I wouldn't like that.  Right now or after Jack Tober?  After Jack Tober.  We don't want Coke Logic confused for Jack Tober. 
[02:14:00]  We're going to muck up the works.  I'm looking forward to the Monday songs from the people out there.  Holy fuck.  That's Starbucks story.  Remember that from earlier?  Fuck yeah.  That went over.  I think we can all agree it went over very well.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I'm let down.  You're not going to believe this one.  Oh.  It went over so well.  This is not real.  No, they didn't.  They didn't tell it again.  No way.  They decided to repeat it later in the show as if it's brand new. 
[02:14:30]  Wait, so this is, they didn't even replay the discussion.  They just decided to redo it?  They did it again.  They did the discussion all over again without any kind of inkling that they had done it earlier?  They didn't say, hey, we were talking about this earlier.  We should do that.  We used to at N.E.W.  We do.  Yeah, we do.  Well, we wouldn't make believe we didn't do it.  We would just replay it, go, oh, earlier from the show, we did this, here it is again.  No, they're not doing that.  Oh, my God.  So they've got to make believe they didn't hear the story. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, how embarrassing.  This is going to be really douchey.  They read a news story, and then they have to put it back in the pile instead of throwing it out,  because that is for later.  Hey.  There are tons of people out there who consider the Starbucks pumpkin spice, speaking of hype.  This wasn't worth doing the first time.  Apparently you are wrong, Opie.  Let's see if they're as surprised about it as they were.  Yeah.  Oh.  There are tons of people out there who consider the Starbucks pumpkin spice, speaking of hype. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  The Starbucks pumpkin spice latte, one of the best parts of fall.  It is very delicious.  If you guys have never had it before, it is a good treat.  I don't want to ruin it for you, but there's no pumpkin in the pumpkin spice latte.  What do you mean?  This is just so crazy.  Ew.  Fucking ew.  Oh, no.  It wasn't worth doing the first time.  Oh, no. 
[02:16:00]  They have to pretend they didn't hear it.  Those two women definitely knew.  How do you run out with it?  You think they knew Sam from earlier?  A hundred percent.  Dude, yep.  That's terrible.  They get to play a lot more commercials than we do.  They probably play some songs, right?  Yes.  Most morning shows.  Tons of songs.  Tons of songs.  Tons of songs.  So they've run out of material where they're taking a who-gives-a-fuck story from earlier  and redoing it?  Just print out another news story.  There's a ton of news out there.  You know what?  The audience turns over, and it's a whole new audience. 
[02:16:30]  The PD told them that.  And you know something?  There's nothing wrong with just doing a break that you feel was a strong break.  Oh, Christ.  And you get on there later on and do it.  You know what that shows?  There's really no consideration that whether you're entertaining your listeners or not.  There's just none.  Because there's people that probably are listening from earlier that are going like, what?  How embarrassing is that?  If you replayed the break, that's not as bad.  Right.  Because it's still terrible. 
[02:17:00]  But-  To fake the-  What?  Oh, that's crazy.  What's crazy about it?  It's not crazy because, once again, I'll repeat my part.  No one eats pumpkin.  Oh.  But that wasn't crazy.  It wasn't like he said, you know what that pumpkin flavoring is?  It's the vomit of a leukemia patient.  Yes.  That would be crazy.  That's crazy.  I mean, I enjoy that.  Oh.  There's no pumpkin in the pumpkin spice latte. 
[02:17:30]  And he went for the dramatic pause, too.  Yes, yes, yes.  And she went, what do you mean?  You could tell-  Listen for the dramatic pause.  They've done the break before, so now it's not even like they're just telling the story.  Now there's an acting element to it.  Right.  You notice, because, like, the dramatic pause, they're a little too surprised about it now.  We've been guilty of that.  Oh, please.  If we're telling a story from the old days, and, like, you've heard it before, or I've heard your story.  Like, whoa, no way!  I'll play along a little bit, a little bit, sure. 
[02:18:00]  But, uh, this-  Spaghetti against the what?  What?  Yes, Jim.  What happened when the dog did-  Well, I don't want to ruin it for you, but there's no pumpkin in the pumpkin spice latte.  What do you mean?  This is just so crazy.  This is just so crazy.  Well, I guess, according to the Huffington Post, the flavor comes from cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and pumpkin pie-flavored syrup.  It's amazing that they can get the flavor without it being in there.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Modern technology.  It's fascinating.  Last time.  Last time.  But the syrup is made of the chemicals and the spices, but no actual pumpkin in the syrup.  That's so fair.  What do you know?  Who knew?  It does taste good, though.  You knew.  That's who knew.  They put their little fresh nutmeg on top of the whipped cream-y stuff.  It's good times.  I think I'm going to go get one of those today and go see-  It's good times.  You should do it.  You should totally do it.  Get your pumpkin spice latte on, Jim.  He left out the oh-my-goodness part, though.  Yeah.  If Jim really wanted one, she would have gotten one, like, an hour ago.  Earlier, when they first talked about it. 
[02:19:00]  Besides us.  Who knew?  Besides us pretending we didn't.  Who knew?  Wow.  That is really embarrassing.  That's fucking atrocious.  That's lazy, man.  Yeah.  Atrocious.  Got a whole staff.  You could find some good stories.  A whole staff.  Exactly.  Spelled H-O-L-E.  Just to keep it fresh for yourselves.  Yeah.  Or just talk about your life.  We got one more track, guys.  One more.  Do you remember that story about men being better drivers?  Yes!  No. 
[02:19:30]  So, they're not only doing this.  No.  They're doing it more than once.  They...  Oh, you don't remember?  Oh, good.  Oh, my God.  They do this, too?  They did the whole...  They did a break where they did, like, three or four news stories.  Uh-huh.  And then, like, a little while later, they did the exact same break with the exact same  news stories in the exact same order.  But they redo it.  That's what's creepy.  That's what I mean.  They redid it.  They don't replay it.  No.  And they don't mention, hey, we were talking about this earlier, but da-da-da-da-da-da-da, 
[02:20:00]  and then make new observations.  They pretend like it's never happened.  Yeah.  Maybe add a little something extra that you forgot to mention the first time you did it,  maybe.  If you're going to do this shit at all.  Oof.  That is just embarrassing.  Do we have that story again?  There's no wonder why we're successful.  All it takes is Jack Tober.  Oh, God.  They don't even fucking try.  It's just...  What?  Phase one complete.  Oh, phase one is complete.  What happened? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, what happened to their Facebook page?  I don't know.  For some reason, the public wall has been closed.  Uh-huh.  Now all you can do is leave comments on their posts.  Right.  Which include a photo of Todd Pettengill and Rocky Dennis.  Rocky Dennis!  I've seen a boat movie.  Instead of Scott.  And a photo of the Kool-Aid man taking down the World Trade Center.  Oh, no. 
[02:21:00]  That's got to be Hulk Hogan every time.  Come on.  Yeah, that's terrible.  That's awful.  Here is the latest shot fired in the endless battle over who's better at driving, men or  women.  Judge has officially ruled that men...  Now that she's talking about the Washington, D.C. story, I didn't say men.  She ran the water.  Yes.  And was shot to death.  Oh, no.  Wow.  That's terrible.  She's a mom.  Oh, good gosh. 
[02:21:30]  What is that?  It's a Photoshopper.  Oh.  Young Eric Nagel.  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  He's holding a big jar of mustard.  Yes.  And he's at his hand in the mustard.  And under it, it says Iraq Army, and then the N-word.  Oh.  Yeah, you don't say it either.  I don't.  Well, let's say niggas if you read it.  Niggas.  Yeah, sample it.  Men are better in this case.  Of course, the judge happens to be a man, so you have to consider the source.  Not sure he was totally impartial. 
[02:22:00]  But Javier Albar is a judge in Zaragoza.  It's the same fucking story.  Yeah.  It's...  It's...  This is horrendous.  Wow, what a lousy show.  This is just terrible.  Lazy.  Yes.  What an easy gig, though.  Oh, look at Kenny Rogers.  He can't even blink anymore.  He doesn't look like Kenny Rogers anymore.  In Spain, I guess he was ruling on a discrimination case where a company was offering driving lessons 
[02:22:30]  to men and women, but for the men, they were charging $900.  For the women, they were charging $1,170.  And that's not fair.  No, it's not at all.  The cup...  He's getting tag-teamed by shit.  That double hole.  The double hole.  Damn.  I don't think you've seen this before.  That's awful.  Oh, my God.  That boy...  Oh, it's not fair.  He's got to be out of his mind. 
[02:23:00]  To sit with that on a daily basis.  Two holes.  The women should be upset if they say, well, the driving tests were given by multiple MIGs,  and he'd throw cum in their face and hair while they throw...  How can they drive?  That's not right.  No.  Oh.  I hope he swallows his own tongue.  $50.  And that's not fair.  No, it's not at all.  The company said they were charging the extra premium to women because female students needed 
[02:23:30]  an average of five more classes than male students before they were ready to get their  driver's license.  Oh, no.  That's just crazy talk.  Well, in the double degrees with you, they fined the company $5,500 for sex discrimination.  Hey, Mo, that's crazy talk.  Why, I said that's crazy talk, Mo.  Crazy talk.  She's like, that's...  She didn't know what to say.  Crazy talk.  It's discrimination. 
[02:24:00]  The company fought back, took it to court, and last week, the judge overturned the fine  because he said that there is statistical data.  Yeah, we heard this.  Statistical proof that men really are better drivers than women.  Yeah.  From whom?  Him.  I would love this co-host to say that.  Like, I heard.  Yeah.  I heard that.  I heard this.  Like, Jack Waltz.  I heard that story.  I ain't no band leader.  Yeah.  Yeah, why couldn't you at least state the obvious and go, we did this already? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And still fool around.  Yeah, earlier.  And then at least fool around with it a little bit.  Brought up this story earlier, in case you weren't listening.  Or be brave enough to...  Hopefully you weren't listening.  I know you weren't listening.  Or be brave enough to be the person in studio who goes, look, we did...  We're going to make believe we don't know this story?  Yeah.  And that would be a fun little thing.  Then they could laugh at that, at least.  They wouldn't laugh at that.  They'd probably go, you can't do that.  Yeah.  Why?  PD would get all mad.  Why can't they do shit like that?  Why can't you just sort of be yourselves?  That's a show that has fucking meetings with a PD all the time. 
[02:25:00]  Consultants.  And it gives them these ideas that, all right, you know, a good break is a good break.  Maybe a couple of times during the show.  You know, the PPMs.  The PPMs.  You know.  We're learning they're only listening for a few minutes a day here and there.  The odds are that they didn't hear it the first time.  It's a strong break.  You do it again.  You're going to be hitting 90% new people.  Oh.  Stinks.  It's horrible. 
[02:25:30]  These fucking pictures.  The guy's talking to his cat.  Of course he is.  This is fucking hilarious.  Apparently their leader, whoever is organizing this attack, their leader is Dennis Falcone.  Wow.  Sam is crying.  It's so funny.  I just love the idea of Dennis Falcone being the leader.  There's a lot of funny shit that happens on this show that you don't laugh at.  And then you find the silliest shit to lose your mind over. 
[02:26:00]  Well, I mean, who would have thought that Dennis Falcone, the guy who's given his life to radio, would lead an attack like this?  Well, now that he's the official leader, don't you think he should come in here?  I mean, I wouldn't go.  What do you think, guys?  Quite that far.  You sure?  Yeah.  Maybe later.  I mean.  Maybe later?  Let's tease that.  I think we're okay with the photos.  Yeah, he'll be coming in at 10.  There you go.  We need it now for Jacktober.  Sam.  We can put one together for tomorrow.  Just a quick little stinger. 
[02:26:30]  A lot of stingers.  Pew, pew, pew.  Oh.  There you go, Pat.  And that's it for today's Jacktober.  Thanks to Jeff and Jen for being so awful at Q102 in Cincinnati.  It's terrible.  Redundant.  We got our heads.  We'll use this out every day.  A staple.  I'll see the boat movie later.  I'm going to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie. 
[02:27:00]  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  Are you recording him every day?  Not every day.  Enough.  You should have every day.  Just because.  Yeah, because every Friday is Scott and Todd day for this year's Jacktober.  All right.  That was a good one.  I think E-Rock's playing this song for himself. 
[02:27:30]  Huh?  Oh, man.  He wants everyone to know he's all right.  Is that it?  Don't worry about me.  What?  What a weirdo. 
[02:28:00]  What?  He's now playing songs for himself.  Communicating through songs, though?  He can't just say.  I like that he's communicating through songs right now.  Did he get any money from you?  No.  No.  Then why is he all right?  I don't know.  I guess he's all right.  I wouldn't fucking do it.  Things are good.  Got a new phone number.  Oh, what is it?  What is it?  What is it?  You know that there's, you know, there's assholes around here.  Yes, we do. 
[02:28:30]  That want to make sure.  You could have ended it right there.  Yeah.  That want to make sure that that was a real mistake.  What do you mean?  Tim, didn't I tell you how to go and talk to Tim after the show yesterday?  I'm not blaming Tim.  He's the messenger.  He had to find out for other people around here to make sure that it absolutely was a  fucking mistake.  Wait, how did they?  But if you listen to Friday's show, it was obvious to everyone it was a horrible, horrible  mistake.  But who wanted to know? 
[02:29:00]  People.  Same fucks.  And what's the difference?  Like, what if you did give it out on purpose?  Oh, then that would be a huge HR issue.  You just can't do that.  Wow.  You can't do that as far as radio goes, and you certainly can't do that as far as employees  go.  So they want to make damn sure that it was.  Damn.  Just a horrible mistake.  Yeah.  You like your new number, E-Rock?  One digit. 
[02:29:30]  Uh-oh.  He's moving a mic for the first time in two days.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Did you memorize it?  Oh, my God.  He's standing up.  Did you memorize it yet?  I hate new numbers.  You've got to memorize them.  Do you have a new number?  Thumbs up.  Okay.  He might talk, but he gave us a thumbs up.  I like a phone number you can remember.  Like where it goes, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, like right away.  But every number's like that.  No, no.  This one goes, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. 
[02:30:00]  That's just what you do in your own head.  Do people understand that?  It's not that you got good numbers.  No, it's good numbers.  You just do with that cadence in your head, and for some reason it makes you, you know,  be able to rattle the number off easily.  Yeah.  Uh, I just got a, uh, uh, uh, a message in my headphones.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Somebody's making the trip to the studio.  Whoa!  Here he comes.  Oh, boy.  He's not doing this from the other room. 
[02:30:30]  Yep.  Oh, oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Somebody's sitting at the big boy table, and he's got paperwork.  It's E-Rock.  Sitting down and chillaxing.  Hi, E-Rock.  E-Rock, how are you, sir?  Oh, what's he going to say?  What's his first word going to be?  Fuck all of you.  Whoa!  Oh, man.  Man.  And hello.  Hi.  How was your vacation?  I like Disney.  It was good.  It was good.  It was the last day, right?  Every day of it?  Not every day, Sam.  Every day.  Not every day.  Not every day.  But all hell broke loose on the last day. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  All but one was fantastic.  How long were you going for?  Please say five days and not seven.  No, it was supposed to be seven, but it wound up being six.  Phew.  Oh, okay.  Did you have to pay for seven?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  I see some paperwork in your hand.  Wait, yes.  A few questions, first of all.  Sure.  I don't know.  Me and E-Rock talked Friday night.  Oh.  A little heart to heart.  Oh.  And you do believe it was a horrible accident, right? 
[02:31:30]  Let's go with that.  Oh.  Let me just play.  Let's go with that.  Remember how we were just talking about CQ-102 or – oh, that was the station I worked  at.  That was 102.  102 in Cincinnati.  Keep it real.  Yes, I do believe.  Thank you.  In certain cases, it wasn't an accident.  There's enough shit there to fool around with, but I do want that out.  What do you mean in certain cases, it was an accident?  I don't think it was meant to go out on the air.  Oh.  Yes, I do believe that was an accident. 
[02:32:00]  What doesn't seem to be too much of an accident is that the dumps seemed to be a little slow  on the draw.  Whoa.  It was.  If dumped at all.  It was slow.  I heard, like, numbers, but I wasn't really paying attention, and then I thought it was  a bit, some kind of bit.  And then when Opie looked at me –  In a panic, be honest.  In a panic, and when they gave him this gesture.  And then he went like this, and then I hit it, but so much time had passed by that point. 
[02:32:30]  It was like –  It was way past the amount of dump that we actually had.  Yeah.  So no matter what was hit, it didn't really –  Yeah, I knew that.  So I knew.  Effectively.  I was like, oh, boy, that ain't working.  What happened?  Did you – let's see.  Do you have a picture with Paul McCartney?  You're shaking.  You're shaking.  Fucking got it.  You're shaking.  Yeah.  That's huge.  Yes.  That was a good one.  Wait, I would have liked a picture with Paul McCartney.  He walked by.  That was one I would have loved.  He walked out.  There was a bunch of people with him, but he was walking by, and he was just like walking 
[02:33:00]  in front of me.  Right.  And I just said, hey, Paul.  And he put out his hand to shake, and I had my camera ready.  And I'm like, can I take a quick picture with you?  I put it to do a selfie.  He goes, okay.  And he put his arm around me, and he told his guy with him.  He goes, oh, take it.  So I handed the photo – the fucking camera to the guy.  Did you just see?  He just smashed it on the floor.  But the guy was like hitting the wrong button.  I'm like, ah.  Oh, no.  But Paul had handed it to him, and it took two seconds, and that was it.  He was great.  Poor hero.  I'm sorry, Eric.  This was supposed to be his spot.  I just walked back in.  Eric's moment.  Go ahead.  You guys asked me.  I wouldn't have interrupted. 
[02:33:30]  Oh.  Just fucking around.  Just par for the – for the – yeah.  Wow.  Travis, you saw him too?  Yeah.  He looked good.  He looks great.  He's Paul McCartney.  I was 10 feet away, and I'm shaking.  Jesus.  It's a beetle.  Oh, fuck.  Is he still here?  It's amazing.  I think he's doing something.  Where?  I don't know.  Oh, Iraq.  No, please find out.  I mean, as much as I make fun of Jimmy, that's a picture I would love.  It was unbelievable. 
[02:34:00]  Just – I mean, he's a legend.  Do you think that's a good shot?  It's a great shot.  Oh, look at that.  I've never been more jealous of a photo.  I don't even see.  Wow, that's a good one.  It's great.  You've seen my Clinton photo, right?  This is better.  You should have.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Why didn't you grab one?  Huh?  Because I'm not Jim.  I stood there.  I stood there and just shook his hand, and it was like, when you ask the artist, they're  never going to say no.  Travis would have faced disciplinary actions had he asked.  Yeah, exactly.  I probably will, too.  Yeah, but you're not going to get fired.  I might get yelled at, but it's like –  I bet you'll get yelled at.  You think so?  Yeah.  Hey, it's McCartney. 
[02:34:30]  I want him to do it.  McCartney was really nice about it.  He had no problem whatsoever.  Yeah, I shook his hand and asked him.  He could have said – he just said, yeah.  Where's he now?  Next time a bloody fool comes up to take my picture, I'll never come back to this fuckhole  again.  Wouldn't it be funny if he just walked out of the building angrily?  Yeah, he's all pissed.  Whoa!  Why'd you –  Who's just –  He's doing something with Dave Marsh.  Danny Falcone just walks in, waltzed in here.  He waved me in.  What?  He waved me in. 
[02:35:00]  And says he's doing something with Dave Marsh like we should know who Dave Marsh is.  Yeah, first of all, we don't know who Dave Marsh is.  On the Springsteen channel.  Okay.  He's a cool dude.  Did Danny just wander in here?  You waved me in.  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  You waved me in.  I didn't see all of you do that.  That was a miscommunication right there.  You gave me the papal wave.  No.  I thought Jimmy Farted and I wanted some of the goodness.  No.  What was Iraq talking about?  I didn't mean to –  It's okay.  It was just the first time he spoke in.  In two days.  Don't worry about Jimmy. 
[02:35:30]  You finally got the balls to come in here, sit down all comfy and discuss the situation  you walked in.  Jim got a celebrity picture.  Jim's got a picture.  Then Danny comes in.  I think it's hilarious actually.  The Paul McCartney thing has got everybody abuzz.  Now Danny wants to see Jim's celebrity photo.  Danny, where's this Paul McCartney – Danny, where's the front studio next to you?  He says he –  Oh.  Iraq left.  We had him.  We finally had him.  Iraq.  Iraq's walking out of his studio.  He looked at Sam and said, ah, we'll do it tomorrow. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, no.  He left.  I would quit this place if I were him.  Wow, right?  That was so real.  He goes, ah, we'll do it tomorrow.  We'll do it tomorrow.  That bill better be going up.  Those numbers better go up.  Dave Marsh.  Rolling Stone, writes the books, the writer, works on the Bruce Springsteen channel.  All right.  Yeah.  But where is he now?  The studio next to the fishbowl.  That's where Paul McCartney is right now?  It's blocked off.  They block him.  Well, it's blocked off with banners so that people walking down the halls can't see. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, perish the thought.  Yeah, why?  What could possibly happen if someone sees Paul McCartney as they're walking to the bathroom?  Probably because they're filming and they probably don't want just a million people behind him staring because he's Paul McCartney and everyone wants a photo with him.  People wouldn't care.  Look how happy Jimmy is.  Dude, he got his guy to do it.  I wasn't going to ask him.  I was going to do a selfie real quick.  And he goes, hey, what do we guys take the picture?  He started to do a selfie and then Paul stopped him.  Let him take the picture?  Yeah, I was ready.  Yeah.  You look great, Jim. 
[02:37:00]  What have you been doing?  Are you on to the next picture yet or are you cool for a little while?  That was just a fun.  I had no idea he was going to be here today.  But how excited will you remain before you have to think about the next picture?  It depends on what you're here tomorrow.  I live day to day, brother.  I know you do.  That's why I'm asking.  And you were all excited that the fucking, this guy's coming in.  Yeah, don't say it because I want to see if we get it done before people start hitting him up.  All right.  I want to hear your rock story.  What are you still doing here?  I have to hook him up with Kelly Clarkson. 
[02:37:30]  I'm doing something today with Kelly Clarkson.  She's got a new Christmas album out.  You're trying to get a picture with Kelly Clarkson?  I already have one when she came in.  Remember she came in that day?  Oh, she did.  I didn't blow it up.  No, she didn't come on our show, though.  Briefly she did.  She did.  I wasn't here that day.  Kelly Clarkson's never been on, I don't think.  I have a picture of her somewhere.  She's a biggie, I guess.  She's saying, what, at the inauguration?  She's going to be in this afternoon.  The swearing in?  Yeah.  One of those fucking things.  I wouldn't call her exactly a biggie. 
[02:38:00]  What resort do you stay in, E-Rock?  He's back to the...  Which one was it?  I just want to know which one it was so I could kind of start thinking about cost.  He was just...  Which one was it, man?  He was just waiting for his moment.  The Yacht and Beach Club.  Ah.  That's nice.  That's a deluxe.  I stay there.  That's a deluxe.  That's a very nice one.  That is a nice one.  I like it.  It's right across from the boardwalk.  So you go over there.  There's a...  Great pool.  The Swan and Dolphin are close. 
[02:38:30]  And there's that hotel over there where they have karaoke.  And a nice Japanese restaurant.  And then the pool is really nice.  Welcome back, Eric.  Oh, I don't want to derail you.  That is a...  I don't think there's any question as to whether or not Mr. Nagel knows how to treat himself  to a vacation.  Eric's throwing Denny out the door.  Why would you throw Denny out?  Well.  Thank God.  I can't believe what they did to your time just now, buddy.  So you stayed there.  That's good.  And that's close to Epcot.  I like that. 
[02:39:00]  Just a little walk.  Just a little walk down the river over the bridge.  And you're right there in Epcot.  For the wonderful drinks and food.  The Harbor Club level.  Oh.  Wow.  That you need one of these to access.  Ah.  A little wristband there.  Why do you still have it?  Because you just take it home with you.  Show off.  Yeah, but why are you bringing it to work?  Is that show and tell?  He just wants to prove that he went.  What is that right there, Eric, in the white paper?  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  This would be a list of things that Greg Hughes said that he would cover. 
[02:39:30]  So you're saying it's an itemized bill?  That it is.  Oh, man.  Can I look at it without saying a word?  Oh, man.  Well, I'd have to do restaurant rules.  If you want to touch the bill, you'd have to contribute.  What?  Well, I don't want to.  We just want to see what it is to see.  Yeah, I won't.  I won't.  How responsible Opia is for this.  There's way more to discuss before we get to the paperwork.  But I just want to see it.  Okay.  Because.  We won't say anything.  Because Eric a minute ago came in here. 
[02:40:00]  And he wouldn't fully let the accident thing off the hook because he started bringing up the dump button.  So he hasn't said where he's laying the flames.  Yeah.  Joe Hoff, 23.  I like him on Twitter.  He writes, did Sir Paul have kittens stuffed in his pockets?  Hoo-hoo.  Here, take this thing.  Hoo-hoo.  Enough with the fucking cats, Howard.  Fuck.  Does he have kittens stuffed in his pockets? 
[02:40:30]  I guess that's a new thing I heard.  You go on the show, you got to take a kitten.  Take a kitten.  Oh, that's funny.  So.  I want a Paul McCartney picture.  Oh, boy.  There are bigger things at play here.  I'll say.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  You get that, right?  The play on the.  Oh, yeah.  I get it.  Yep.  What?  You got that, Roland?  I heard that chuckle.  I did.  So what happened Friday? 
[02:41:00]  Where were we?  So apparently you gave my number out on the phone, over the air.  And you admitted that was a horrible mistake.  Yes.  And.  At first you thought I did it for real, by the way.  Well, what was I to think?  Because we discussed this.  Um.  You should think that that would be way too far, even for me.  No, because when.  Motherstone concert's different than a phone number.  Phone number is a very, you know.  I would never do that.  Yeah.  I'm not even going to play the role on the radio. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  I just would never do that.  Oh.  Oh.  So.  That's major problems you're looking at.  You're looking at.  Yeah.  So, um, when that happened, um, I got notice from other people that were listening to the  show at that point and told me that this was going on.  Oh my God.  So I went, I was livid.  I turned on my phone and just had enough time to send. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, be a text before my phone decided to no longer work.  What do you mean?  You know, the little green icon that has the, uh, the thought bubble for messages.  Yeah.  And you know, it would have a little red number up at the top telling you how many you have.  Sure.  Picture it going from under 10 to nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, right?  Wow.  And then a message popping up at the same time saying your voice, uh, your voicemail is full. 
[02:42:30]  Um, I can't access the audio portion that that's on my phone.  Oh boy.  And then I didn't even know about this MMS messaging, which I guess is for pictures.  Uh, a lot of plates of food, cockpicks, and then somebody had sent me the entire history  of the development.  You could have just said both food.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then somebody sent me the, uh, the history of the, the development of the hot dog. 
[02:43:00]  Um, and, uh, then some weird symbol showed up on the phone where I, it would not function  at all.  It had to be, um, completely reset.  Did you try putting it on airplane mode?  You just couldn't?  I couldn't get to it.  Um, by the time I got back.  The whole phone was jammed up.  As soon as I turned it on, sent out the text to him, everything hit all at once because the  phone was off.  Well, did you reboot?  Like, did you try the hard reboot?  I was trying.  It wasn't doing it. 
[02:43:30]  I had to do it plugged in to the computer when I got back to, uh, you know, got back  home.  And as soon as that worked, I flipped it onto airplane mode and do not disturb so I could  back up the stuff.  Wow.  And then the phone was completely useless.  Did you know that somebody had really mucked up the works?  Yes.  I flattered that I was the last text message from your phone.  Wow.  There was also a lot of s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s.  S-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s.  A lot of s-s-s-s-s-s-s.  No other comments, just U-C-T and a bunch of S's. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Across the text.  It's chipping.  That's great.  I don't think it would be out of line to ask for a, uh, just a, just a, just a little  apology.  From you?  Yes.  What?  Why are you laughing?  Why would E-Rock have to?  I apologized many times.  I apologize.  I'm sorry on the phone, in text messages, through other people.  Just a little apology because you really thought I would do something like that on purpose.  I think that's fair. 
[02:44:30]  No.  Why?  No.  Because we're in agreement that was a horrible mistake, but you assumed I did it on purpose.  And I think we have such a friendship that I think a slight, just like, look, a little apology.  A little apology?  No, because when-  Just something like, I'm really sorry that I really thought you did it on purpose.  That's all.  Because when other people who aren't on the air here are getting texts saying, Greg just gave out your phone number. 
[02:45:00]  And my wife goes-  Wow, he's using my real name.  Of course he did.  Shit just got real.  Shit.  No Q102 in this shit.  Were you mad?  Oh, I was furious.  Oh, man.  And when the phone bricked up, and it was just completely-  I'm like, I wanted to throw it against the wall.  Yeah.  So I just dropped the phone.  I was screaming.  And then-  What did your wife say at that point?  Because you- 
[02:45:30]  Oh, she just kept saying, of course he did this.  Oh, wow.  But-  Damn.  But in all fairness, because, you know,  I'm not looking too good here.  Again, this is prior to finding out it's a mistake.  In all fairness, our relationship is such that you should know that I would have never done that.  No, but it happened.  Yeah, I know.  I've taken complete responsibility for that.  So immediately, your first reaction to it is, oh, maybe this was a mistake.  Oh, I understand why you would think that, but I'm just thinking a little apology now that you know what really went on. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, wow.  Not happening.  Ouch.  And then, getting updates with such comments of, a lot of Space Mountain, Tower of Tiramisu, who said that stuff.  I was just-  With quotes and a dash saying, Anthony or Jimmy.  Just going through some of the rides there at Disney.  Did you hear the whole show Friday?  I heard up until you jock-tobered Scott and Todd. 
[02:46:30]  Okay, so go around the room.  I think you focused enough on me.  Uh-oh.  I want to see what you think of the other guys.  It's only fair.  Okay.  Because everyone had a part in this.  Yes.  I had the biggest part.  I had the biggest piece of pie.  You had a doozy.  How did we all have a part in it?  You guys pushed you forward.  You said, oh, you know, I hope they're not sending cockpicks.  I meant it.  I was worried about you.  Look at sweet-  We think how many cockpicks you would have gotten if you didn't say that. 
[02:47:00]  It just occurred to me that I hope that you don't have to see that on your vacation.  I'm chiming into it.  I'm not saying that, you know, you have a huge part, but certainly there's other parts in this.  Well, you're talking about I did email.  You did email.  Yes.  He was not happy.  No, no, no.  And I reached out to you.  Did everyone from the show reach out to you?  Oh, well.  Well, no.  No, because I think-  It's all I was in shit.  You've got to reach out.  Hold on.  I think the quote was from Friday.  I won't remember this as soon as I leave the studio. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  What an asshole I am.  Well, I got-  I'm sorry, E-Rock.  I emailed E-Rock.  And you know the response I got?  That's terrible.  I'm done, Jim.  I've had enough.  Wow.  E-Rock was not happy.  So I guess the restaurant was out of food.  See, this is where it's not helping.  No, no.  See, when he says, I'm done, I've had enough.  And then, you know-  You would never get that text from me.  No, no. 
[02:48:00]  Well, I did remember and, you know, felt bad about it.  But here's the truth of the matter.  I've had to change phone numbers during my tenure as a radio host.  You've been doing it longer than that.  Tenure.  Tenure.  And though somewhat inconvenient, it is not as devastating as you have been portraying it,  E-Rock.  I got to be honest.  Wow. 
[02:48:30]  Not quite as devastating.  It's inconvenient.  We pushed it forward for three hours on our show.  It's inconvenient.  I understand.  It sucks.  You got to get a new number.  But in this day and age, with the cloud and backing stuff up and contacts and everything,  it is not as big a hassle as it used to be.  So, okay, fair point.  One, I don't use the cloud service.  I do have it backed up.  Yeah, it's backed up, though.  Got to back that shit up.  But when you're on vacation and not near any of that stuff and can't access any of that 
[02:49:00]  stuff, and maybe you had your electronic boarding pass on the phone, which I couldn't get to.  Oh, man.  So that was an inconvenience.  Whoa.  Not cloud.  And, you know, other things on there.  So for the time being, until I could get back, it was a major hassle.  Okay.  All right.  Fair enough.  I could grasp onto that.  All right.  What else? 
[02:49:30]  All right.  All right.  There was that.  There was the, again, the lack of urgency for the dump doesn't seem to make any sense.  I don't think Opie knew immediately that that had even happened.  I was amazed.  I couldn't believe it happened.  When he looked at me with that horror look, I didn't even know what he wanted at first.  Puppet dog eyes.  I was begging you.  He's like, but I didn't even know what he wanted until he made the push the dump button 
[02:50:00]  thing.  And then I hit the button.  But by that point, you know.  We heard the numbers going out.  And literally, it was one of those things where, like, no one gives out phone numbers  on the air.  So it was like, you're hearing something, and you're like, I'm missing something.  Like, if I would have hit it, it's something.  If he would have done that, right?  He's giving the phone number out.  It's just playing over the phone.  And I would have hit the dump button.  My thought would have been, he'd have turned and gone, dude, why'd you fucking do that?  I'm doing a bit, or I'm doing, like, I wouldn't have just hit the button without knowing what 
[02:50:30]  he was doing.  The last thing I thought was that he would have been giving out a phone number, you know.  Because, you know, I swear, you know we just don't do that.  It was right.  That is way too many problems.  Exactly.  I mean, he was winking while he did it, but, like, I knew it was one of those things,  but.  Oh, Jesus.  No, it was, it was.  Yeah, it was one of those things that just, you know, even though there's a backup system,  there's two people, you know, it's just.  Three.  I learned I had a dump button.  It didn't fucking.  I forgot.  I forgot that we had a dump button.  You know I don't have one. 
[02:51:00]  It didn't go through.  I know Jimmy doesn't have one.  Why are you doing heavyweight?  No.  I'm cold.  I tried to hit my desk, but there's no button.  Oh, my God.  Try using your teeth.  I'm talking about you, Sam.  That means Sam wants to be talked about.  Oh, that's right.  Well, yeah.  So, all right.  Just.  Going all the rides?  Here's the mindset of it, all right?  So, the number goes over the air.  The dump doesn't happen, despite the fact that there's three people with three dump buttons. 
[02:51:30]  Okay?  Doesn't happen.  Then, it happened to me.  Okay?  Right.  And I'm not there, and I'm away.  So, a lot of times, when I'm not here and away, shit happens.  Okay?  So, when this does happen, nowhere in your thought process do you think that this is a mistake.  But it was.  Thus, then.  Just a tiny apology.  Again, this is all pre-mistake.  So, after you get past the pre-mistake, you'll realize the error in your ways. 
[02:52:00]  You think it's, you know.  In my ways, no.  Did you?  Thinking that I would actually do that.  How long before you found out?  Till you started, like, having fun again on your vacation.  That was their last day.  Oh, that didn't happen.  No?  No.  Oh, man.  Did you go on any rides?  That day, no.  I was.  Don't answer that question.  He's setting up for his own trip.  No, no, no.  I wasn't.  I went through every single ride.  I don't even know.  I thought you might have forgot one, and you just needed to get it out there. 
[02:52:30]  Did he really wreck your day?  Yeah, kind of did, Jim.  Kind of did.  Well, the Obster's offer must have made you feel better.  Well, that I wasn't aware about.  Oh, what an offer.  Until later in the day.  Oh, no.  When people who I got to talk to said, you know, he's going to cover everything.  Who was talking to you and telling you all this info about the show and Tower of Tiramisu?  Friends and family that listened to the show.  So they said, well, you know, he offered to cover everything. 
[02:53:00]  I said, no.  What are you talking about?  So I immediately went on the app and got to hear the show.  You wanted fucking proof.  Well, find the clip.  And my day got a little brighter.  What did you hear that made your day brighter?  I heard airfare and hotels.  No, I heard vacation.  Followed up by Sam and Roland doing in-depth research as far as covering phone expenses and a new phone. 
[02:53:30]  No, I'm not doing a new phone.  You got to get him a new phone.  Okay, Fonzie.  Did you get a new phone?  Yeah.  They, I'm on the list.  They're not anywhere.  I've tried all the way through.  But you got a new number?  I got a new number.  What is it?  Oh, on the old phone, you got a new number.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, but it's.  Give it to me now.  I'm having a weird thing because I'm out of contract.  So.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  So I can't do certain things until I get a new phone. 
[02:54:00]  Two digits and a new number.  Just two.  F and U.  Awesome.  All right.  So there's the phone.  Cool.  There was.  You want, obviously you're going to want the iPhone.  Sure.  The 5S.  They're entitled.  5S.  They keep trying to peddle that 5C crap on you.  5C bullshit.  No, you're a 5S guy.  It comes in teal and gold.  Yeah.  Gives a shit.  Exactly.  Who are they?  5S motherfucker.  Yes.  64 gig everything.  Of course. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  So you deserve the best.  You work hard.  Play hard.  Why shouldn't you be able to just walk into a store and buy it at this point?  You can't.  Fucking assholes.  Because Apple is fucking.  Apple stinks.  I've even tried the shitty stores like Radio Shack thinking no one.  Right, right.  No one goes there.  Nobody has it.  So I'm on the waiting list with Apple.  Great.  I think I got your new number.  I think I figured it out.  Oh, no.  Uh-uh.  What?  What happened?  Is that it?  I think so.  Oh, no.  Gave you 10 bucks.  You're like looking so fucking nervous.  I think I'm just working with the alphabet. 
[02:55:00]  I think I got your new number.  I don't have it.  Oh, no.  Oh, you're making it.  But I'm scared to give out the fake number so people can figure it out because it might  be someone's real number.  Someone's real number somewhere.  I feel horrible for whoever takes that phone number.  Oh, no.  Because the second I could switch that off, it was done.  And then I said, so what happens with the number?  And they said, well, there's a grace period.  Of 40 years, I hope.  And then it goes right back into circulation. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  But they didn't tell me how long the grace period is.  So it could be a couple days, a week, whatever.  No, no, no.  It's probably like a year at least.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Once in a while, you'll get a call, like it's somebody else's number.  But it doesn't happen nearly as often as it should.  So it's obvious.  It's a while.  They wait a while.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to say it's probably at least a year, maybe more.  Well, the nice memes that were sent to me with my phone number in various situations,  we'll guarantee that number will be used in the future. 
[02:56:00]  Were some of the mean-spirited memes?  We didn't see any of them.  Yeah.  Well, that one I did not see.  But there's one of me, I guess, my face on a fat lady in a red dress.  And it said for, like, for BBWs and big gals looking to party.  Oh, the listeners.  Yeah.  My goodness, man.  Do you see why I would ask for a little apology?  Just like slight.  Because you're insane. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, no.  There's no reason for an apology.  Well, you thought I would do something as awful as that on purpose.  Everyone would have thought you did something.  No, not really.  Not the people that have a relationship with me.  If that happened to you, if it happened to me, and you heard somebody text you, Greg  gave out your phone number over the air.  If that was the text?  Yeah.  I would assume that Greg gave out my phone number on the air.  There you go.  You son of a bitch.  If that's what the text says, that he gave it out.  I would know it was a mistake on some level.  You fucking rat.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:57:00]  I would assume it was an error or someone was lying.  Anyone with a fucking brain would assume it was an error.  I would have to say, like, wait, what was the context?  How did that happen?  Right.  Like, I'd want to know how it happened.  You would ask a few questions.  Right.  You don't assume something.  Well, I was told how it happened, but that still didn't clear him of innocence.  When they said, well, he was calling you and was playing your voice message over the air.  Because he wanted to leave a rude message.  Shut up, Sam.  Oh, that was the other thing, too. 
[02:57:30]  He wasn't paying attention because he was thinking of vile things to say to me on the voice message.  That's inappropriate.  You go on that mission of Mars at Epcot?  Don't answer.  I think it's gone.  It was killing people, right?  Yeah.  I went on it, like, six years ago.  Yeah, yeah.  And I walked away from it.  And, like, five minutes later, I had such a bad headache and my equilibrium was off.  Why?  Because it's like you're going in space.  The thing shakes you and throws you off.  It's bun you around.  It made centrifugal force give you the effect that it would spin you around. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, fuck that.  And you get pushed back in your seat.  But your visual cue is that you're going forward.  Oh, my God.  So you'd feel like you're getting pushed back in your seat.  Meanwhile, you're spinning.  You feel like you're...  Fuck that.  When the force is hitting you, you feel like you're going to throw up and it's just going  to go over your face.  It puts you upside down so you feel like you're getting pressure in your head.  But you don't know you're upside down because your visual cues are on a screen and it's  different.  So it's tricking your senses into thinking you're super accelerating.  Is that what it probably feels like to really take off? 
[02:58:30]  I think so.  It's pretty fucked up.  I feel like you're fucking zooted.  Yes.  Can't you just close your eyes?  No.  It doesn't matter.  Some kid died in it and then they tamed it down and then they made two versions.  Yeah.  How long was the ride?  They have people with heart attacks.  It's like 18 hours long.  Oh, see, I would have thought...  You spin around.  Oh, no wonder people aren't feeling well.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, so they made two versions.  I think like an extreme version.  It's still there?  Yeah.  Oh, Iraq missed it.  I didn't see it.  You're full of turkey.  Maybe you're too busy being mad at your phone.  Exactly. 
[02:59:00]  Too busy blaming people.  That's a tough ride.  I heard it was crazy.  Yeah, like there's green and orange.  Yeah.  Orange is like...  Yeah, we went on the orange.  Yeah, we went on the orange too.  And like Lisa was totally fine and I did not enjoy that.  How long was the ride?  Maybe...  Five minutes?  Yeah, maybe.  Wow.  So the green is a milder version?  Yeah.  Green is easy.  And the orange, it spins you in a circle?  It does all kinds of things.  It just makes you feel like it.  You start off on your back. 
[02:59:30]  And it simulates the shuttle taking off.  Is that fun, that part?  No.  No.  I would like to take off in a shuttle.  Nothing's fun.  It simulates you going through the atmosphere and everything's hitting you and shaking you  and you're starting to panic.  It's really intense.  Do you think anybody pukes on it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hold on.  They're saying this thing's still open.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, it is.  Travis is saying that.  Yeah.  But this guy just was on it.  I mean, Sean in Brooklyn.  And I was going to be like, you're a pussy.  There's nothing.  Yeah, but Travis was just saying that. 
[03:00:00]  It's not closed.  My six-year-old went on it this last month.  You're a faggot if you don't.  Six-year-old.  They don't allow six-year-olds on that fucking thing.  Yes, they do, you douchebag.  It's called height requirement, asshole.  Well, what a parent you are, asshole.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Shouldn't take your six-year-old on there.  Sure.  Fucking nuts.  Iraq has come back from vacation with a little attitude.  Yep.  No, I honestly didn't see it.  I thought it was closed.  Yeah.  But people there were telling you stories about Mission to Mars. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, it's always horror stories.  Yeah.  I'd rather just go on soaring.  I'm starting to think you're avoiding apologizing to me.  It does seem that way.  We've moved past that.  It ain't happening.  You sure?  I'm positive.  Well done, sir.  Oh, God.  Yeah, a lot of those, too.  Iraq has a real pep in his step today, though, because he knows it's going to be a good day.  Oh, yeah.  He knows.  Why didn't you personalize your voicemail?  Actually, I've never personalized mine, either. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, you don't have yours on.  Well, no.  Yeah, I didn't even think to.  I just put it on whatever the generic setting is.  I think my mom hung up on me the other day.  I half-handedly invited her to the first birthday party and christening.  And that's when she hung up?  Well, she called, like, once by the answer to the phone, and then she called again, and  I went, hello, and I heard a little pause, and then a, bam!  What was the number on the thing? 
[03:01:30]  What do you mean?  Wouldn't the number pop up on your ID?  Oh, no, I know it was her.  So she either couldn't hear me and hung up, or she hung up.  I mean, those are the only two choices.  Thus then, no mom at the first birthday party or christening.  You left her a message inviting her?  Yeah.  What does this have to do with my apology?  Not a thing.  Oh.  So now, you know.  All right, so then what happens?  Yeah, walk us through this shit. 
[03:02:00]  All right, so, um, all right, we get to the point where Ant and Jim are egging it on to  go further than it should have.  Making it way worse, right?  Yeah.  And, uh...  I didn't mean to egg it.  I was trying to stop it.  And then in the middle of nowhere, uh, let's take a break.  Dan Soder's here, and we have Jocktober.  So everything's all good.  Yeah.  And, uh, pretty much that's how the show ended on Friday, while I sat there with a  non-working phone, going through the airport, wanting to kill all of you, and such. 
[03:02:30]  Now, here's the thing, though.  Your wife has a phone.  Yeah.  So it's easy enough to get your boarding pass pulled up on her phone through the emails  and stuff like that.  Or the kiosk at the airport.  Yeah, or you could just use the kiosk or something like that.  So, you know, again, inconvenient, not devastating, not devastating.  Wasn't it nice to be off the grid?  Um...  Yeah, it was off the grid pretty much for the vacation.  Coeclogic brings up a very good point. 
[03:03:00]  Coeclogic on Twitter.  Isn't Iraq at fault here for not answering, uh, your call?  Meaning our call.  Wow.  That's a pretty good point.  And then he writes, that's just rude.  If you would have picked up, the whole thing would have been avoided.  You were onto us this vacation.  It would have gone to the police.  This would never have happened.  Well, that too, right?  You were onto us this vacation.  Because we tried calling you earlier in the week and it wouldn't write the voicemail.  No, the second that I'm gone here, that phone is off.  Why do you think that they're going to prank you? 
[03:03:30]  Uh, because...  It's happened many times.  And then I get yelled at for stupid, why don't you turn your phone off when you're on vacation?  Name one time it's happened.  Uh, let's see.  When was my honeymoon?  A few years ago.  What did they do?  Where someone found the room that I was in internationally and then proceeded to make  whale noises and a terrible bad Jamaican accent screaming how there was too many ice cream  bowls all over the floor of my hotel room. 
[03:04:00]  I forgot about the bowls.  And at that point, I hung the phone in the bowl.  I forgot about the ice cream bowls.  What did I say about ice cream bowls?  I don't remember.  No.  There was too many, uh, ice cream bowls laying all over the floor.  Who keeps having so much ice cream?  There's bowls.  We got no more ice cream bowls.  But he couldn't serve ice cream to the rest of the hotel because he had all the ice  bowls in it.  I don't remember that.  I forgot it's his very moment.  That's convenient.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:04:30]  That might have to be on a future podcast.  But this week's podcast, let's not forget, Shit Stories.  Yeah, Poop Show.  Poop Show is going down tomorrow, right?  That'll be a good one.  You'll be able to download it starting tomorrow.  All Poop Stories, including Jim Brewer's great Poop Story.  Anyway, go ahead, Eero.  In the future, you can have more Poop Podcasts because we looked up the material.  There's at least 50 segments involving shit, duty, poop, all that.  Childish radio show.  These are just stories, though.  A lot of them involve you.  Of course they do. 
[03:05:00]  Eerox's got some confidence.  Yeah.  Well, Eerox, your offer was very generous.  I was impressed with it, to be honest.  I was impressed with Obie's offer.  So then a lot of decompressing over the weekend and coming back here.  Someone popped you with a pen.  Oh, now.  Oh, you get that, right?  I get it.  That's just mean-spirited.  I'm happy the kid's back.  I'm just grateful he's talking to us.  Yes.  How close were you to walking away?  For most of Friday, pretty. 
[03:05:30]  I was fed up with all of it.  Wow.  Was your gal angry?  I was.  Huh?  Was your gal angry?  Yeah.  She was, not to the level I was, but she was kind of upset over it.  Sure.  So, yeah.  It hit a level that I didn't think I would reach.  Oh.  And I was, I thought at one point, I was just like, I'm fucking done with this.  I can so relate.  Because I was thinking, how would anyone in their right mind think I would do that on  purpose?  I was out of my mind about it. 
[03:06:00]  You were thinking, I'm done with this?  Yeah.  I'm like, what the fuck?  If people think that's how I really am, I can't be around this shit.  Apology.  And yet you're here.  And it was the happiest place on earth.  That's where you are.  Yeah.  You know?  I've gone there many times.  Stop.  It was a lot of fun.  It was for six days.  He's setting up for something.  I've stayed at the beach and yacht.  Yeah.  It's fucking nice.  Yeah.  I did that, what's that fucking French Quarter?  That New Orleans one?  Okay.  I'm actually just saying I've been there. 
[03:06:30]  You know what?  I thought it was you, but I think it might have actually been Travis who somebody said  the beached whale and yacht club.  I think that was Travis.  Okay.  That sounds like something neat.  Travis said that.  It wasn't me.  Yeah, yeah.  Thinking up jokes without paying attention to the dump button.  Yeah.  That's right.  Whoa.  A little shot at Travis.  Oh, man.  Whoa.  That's right.  And there's a whole befriending thing that he discussed.  Yeah, instead of-  Why did you befriend, befriend?  Defriend. 
[03:07:00]  Defriend.  Or unfriend.  Unfriend.  Thank you.  Why did you unfriend?  Travis.  Oh, I did that a long time ago.  Why?  Oh, wow.  Why?  Let's get to it.  He doesn't need tequila today, by the way.  I felt that certain people, as time was going on, were, may not have been very trustworthy  as far as being friends on Facebook.  Wow.  So...  Why not?  People started to get eliminated here and there. 
[03:07:30]  Was he taking liberties?  I think I thought at the time he was, but it might have been rectified.  Is that why you defriended Troy, too?  No.  No, Troy was just angry.  And so you didn't want to-  He just kept getting mad over things.  Well, we sure know that about Troy.  So I just didn't, I mean, there was really no problem.  Just he would see stuff and then he'd get mad that I was doing-  So you put him out of his misery.  If he saw, like, Legos or something, he'd get all upset in the air.  Oh, wow.  So I was like, all right, you know what, I'll just- 
[03:08:00]  You're a good friend.  I'll spare him the anguish.  Good friend.  And defriended him.  I was walking down the hall.  Why did Eric defriend me?  Unfriended you.  He doesn't trust you.  He felt you were taking liberties.  I never did anything to Eric's Facebook.  He doesn't trust.  Like I said, at the time, I was starting to eliminate people here and there because I  felt everyone was not-  Taking liberties.  Not really sincere.  Oh.  So.  That's why-  Eric, I hit the dump button when they gave out your number. 
[03:08:30]  I swear to God.  Okay.  I hit it.  Sal saw the numbers go down.  It was too late.  But how come it didn't go-  How come it went out?  I have no idea what I did hit.  I hit it like five times.  I was like, use all dump up.  I didn't see the numbers go down.  I wasn't even in the producers.  You didn't see the numbers go down?  I swear to you.  Oh, man.  Look.  He's not even backing up.  Back up, walked away immediately.  Isn't Sal the guy that said only recently that we all take care of each other?  Not anymore.  Holy shit.  I specifically said we don't take care of each other.  I'm not dealing with Sal. 
[03:09:00]  What's that?  I'm not dealing with Sal.  You're not dealing with Sal.  Oh, man.  I don't think any of us should.  Well, Sal didn't say-  Wow.  E-Rock, why?  Sal wouldn't allow that lie to be told.  Yeah, because he had your back on that one.  Eric, I said I would have hit the dump button if I was in the room, even if Travis was on the board.  Shoulda, woulda, shoulda, didn't.  Whoa.  Eric, I wasn't even in the studio.  I came in and found out later on what was happening.  I don't know.  Wow, we finally have someone to blame.  Yeah, exactly.  Finally.  Ooh.  Finally, a fucking scapegoat.  Scape ass.  Scape panda. 
[03:09:30]  I don't get that.  Yeah.  Well.  Oh, wow.  I've been-  Why don't you want any of us dealing with Sal anymore?  Because why waste the time with it?  It's just a waste of time.  I think we can finally-  We have more important things to deal with, like the bill here.  I've been to Disney many times, Opie, and I've stayed at some of the top-of-the-line resorts.  I've stayed at the Beach and Yacht Club there, and it could get up there. 
[03:10:00]  It's amazing.  As far as the cost goes.  Not only that, but now dinners and stuff.  You pay.  What?  Were you going to other restaurants?  Was it the included thing?  Yeah, we were going to restaurants using the dining plan.  All right, the dining plan.  All-inclusive.  Okay.  But some of those restaurants-  This is good.  Dining plan.  Some of those restaurants-  Yeah.  Coke float.  Don't just take your one meal. 
[03:10:30]  Right.  Some of them take two or three, depending on the restaurant.  And the amount, I think, too.  Yeah.  So it's like, if you went to this restaurant, it equals one meal.  But if you go to this one, it equals three meals.  So the French restaurant was amazing, and that was three.  You mean you didn't eat at McDonald's?  Oh, boy.  The Japanese restaurant, which is hibachi and sushi. 
[03:11:00]  Yes, I've been there.  It's great.  It's three.  Fucking great.  How many do you get?  How many do you get?  Yeah, like you said, that's three.  The dining plan, it's one snack, one walk-up meal, and then one dining meal.  One dinner.  That would count as three dining meals?  Three dining meals.  Oh, boy.  And you only get those for, like, how many days you're there?  Yeah.  So that's half your fucking stay at one Japanese place.  One, yeah, one to two days would probably take out all of your dining plans. 
[03:11:30]  And were you drinking?  Of course.  All right.  You have to try the native alcohol.  And that isn't on the dining plan?  No, it's not.  I don't think the alcohol is not.  Alcohol, you've got to pay cash.  That's a separate bill, especially when you have people who enjoy fine wine.  Oh, of course, of course.  I was experienced to sake for the first time.  Different levels I was not aware of.  Now, did you eat responsibly on this vacation?  Oh, no, Jim.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:12:00]  Oh, no.  Whoa.  All right.  Let's talk about the Park Hopper Pass.  But it was quality over quantity.  Of course.  Now I want to talk about Park Hopper Pass.  Yes.  Wait a minute.  Did you have that key that gets you access to every single park on the complex?  I did.  Oh!  All right.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  That, my friend, is a biggie.  The magic your way ticket.  The magic your way ticket. 
[03:12:30]  What is that?  Like, you know, 10, 20 bucks?  That's the one.  You have it.  It's a six-day Park Hopper Pass.  And you could go anywhere.  You slide that bitch in the turnstile.  You are going in.  Oh, it's bracelets.  Bracelets now.  Oh, no more card?  Everything is bracelet and fingerprints.  How do you get in your room?  Bracelet.  Bracelet.  Bracelet in your room?  To get to your floor in the elevator, you have to use the bracelet.  To get in the park, you have to use the bracelet and a fingerprint.  You were staying in a room that's so nice, you got a scan in the elevator.  You couldn't get to my floor unless you had the bracelet. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, man.  Is it a nice hotel?  It's a very nice hotel.  You have your own private concierge.  They're very nice.  Oh, shit.  A nice room in a nice hotel.  Holy fuck.  You really treated yourself.  Treat yourself.  We did.  Parks the club level good.  Six days.  Diamonds.  Oh, man.  One of the top resorts in Disney.  One of the top rooms in that resort.  Top room.  Meals.  Well, he blew through the Japanese in three days. 
[03:13:30]  Includes the gratuity with everything.  Oh, boy.  That pass is fucking huge.  Are you a big tipper?  Well, it's already taken care of with the package.  Uh-huh.  All right.  What else costs?  Well, you're talking about, we talked about the phone.  Yeah, well, the phone itself.  I didn't say it was paid for the phone.  What about some souvenirs, some shirts, and whatnot?  Let's go staying with the Park Hopper Pass, as we're saying.  During this time of year, there's certain events that also go on at these parks. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, right.  So, at the Magic Kingdom, at night, they have their special Halloween party.  Oh.  Where they close the park to everybody else at 6 o'clock.  Wow, yeah.  And you have to have special tickets to stay in the park.  Uh-huh.  And then the whole park turns over to Halloween.  And it looks all orange.  Orange.  The lights and purple.  Purple and green.  And the spider webs.  And all that stuff, right?  I went there once for Halloween.  It was great.  Do you go on the, like, what do you, can you have fun there if you don't go on the rides? 
[03:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You can, yeah, I mean, why would you go there and not go on any of the rides?  Yeah, I don't like rides.  I get sick.  You go on some of the cheesy Disney rides.  Yeah.  You know, the fairy ones.  Yay.  The small world.  Go on the little carousel.  Go on the Dumbo fucking things.  Yay.  Up, down.  Up, down, up, down.  That's it.  Up, down.  Okay.  That's not what he was getting at.  No, no, I swear.  The Dumbo ride.  It is the Dumbo ride.  It is the Dumbo ride.  It's the same thing as the fucking space one in Tomorrowland.  Well, you have to pay extra for the Halloween passes. 
[03:15:00]  Uh-huh.  I hope so.  It doesn't count with your park copper pass.  A special treat.  So you decided to skip it.  So we got the Halloween pass.  Oh, they didn't skip it.  Treated yourself.  Did ya?  Treated yourself.  You got cheap tickets to fly down there, though, right?  Oh, we'll get to that.  Oh, no, oh, no.  And the best part about this time of year is that there's a lot of people, but not enough  to crowd everything.  Uh-huh.  So you're getting into every ride within five minutes.  Wow.  Good choice.  Yeah.  That's nice. 
[03:15:30]  Space Mountain multiple times.  No line.  It's great.  It was great.  So the Halloween passes.  Then on Thursday, we decided, you know what?  Maybe we should change it up a little bit.  Uh-oh.  Sure.  Uh-oh.  And decided to go to Universal Studios and Island of Adventure.  Oh.  What?  Wait, what?  Wait, what?  A whole nother park.  Dude, put it this way.  Everything they got at Disney has no value at Universal. 
[03:16:00]  Nope.  At least they'll get my little apology out of this.  We did almost every park but the water parks for Disney.  So that's four parks.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Outside of the water parks.  So then we had the two park passes for Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.  Oh, my God.  And then.  That's going to.  And a dinner at one of the fancy hotels that are at the Universal property.  The Portofino Hotel. 
[03:16:30]  Oh, you ate at the Portofino Hotel.  That sounds fancy.  No all-inclusive shit there.  That's all cash on the barrel head right there.  The Italian restaurant is amazing.  What did you have?  I had.  Well, they did not have the lasagna.  Iraq will have the linguine and white clam sauce and a Coke with no ice.  They had a traditional Sunday sauce.  Oh, wow.  With spaghetti and meatballs that had beef and pork and all that.  Oh, my God.  Some wine was mixed into it. 
[03:17:00]  Did you indulge?  A little wine?  Oh, I ate it.  Sugar.  Oh, my God.  So that was fun.  And then, you know, cab to and from the park back to Disney.  Absolutely.  How far was the park?  Maybe 20 minutes.  That's a cab ride.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's.  And this was spur of the moment.  So it's not like you could find a deal on park passes.  No.  You had to go and it was just two adults.  Just splurged. 
[03:17:30]  Just splurged.  And what airline did you take?  Uh, we'll get to that.  Whoa.  Also at Epcot was the food, international food and wine festival.  Oh, no.  That's right.  Hey.  How lucky.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Fuck you all.  Yes.  As you go around the world.  You go around the world from, I believe, Canada to a Mexico and everything in between.  Yep.  And, um, wow.  Yeah.  And that isn't included.  No.  No.  Why would it be?  Because they open up exhibits for countries that aren't featured at Epcot. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, they do.  Yeah.  Wow.  So, of course, you have your, uh, you know, your little bracelet and your, and your little  food passport that they give you.  Oh.  And you go eating and drinking around the world.  Around the world.  Well, did you treat yourself to that?  Oh, yes.  Let's, uh, try, uh, Germany.  It was a two-day ordeal.  Ah.  Oh, look, France.  We're in France.  Let's try some French wine.  Let's take a two-day ordeal around the world.  Oh, my God.  Two-day ordeal.  Two days.  Three days.  Not a fan of the, uh, the, uh, the Ouzo from Greece. 
[03:18:30]  Oh, Ouzo's terrible.  At least you tried it.  Black licorice liqueur.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Terrible.  Not pleasurable.  I'm happy for you.  Oh, some French, uh, French wines must have been nice.  Yes, there was a lot of, uh, different types of sangria.  Ah.  From Argentina and Chile and Mexico.  And the Italy, of course.  Italy.  Probably a nice, uh.  They had some, uh, some nice, uh, food exhibits, some nice wine.  Oh.  And then, you know, right next to Italy is Morocco.  Which had great wine.  Going into France, which had great wine. 
[03:19:00]  Of course.  And you have to stop everywhere.  And you're paying for each time you, you get something.  Yeah.  And then, you know, they have a little concert.  Yeah, yeah.  They have a concert there that you, you don't know what band's playing.  Sure.  But you're kind of hammered, so you need to maybe take a little break.  Yeah.  And sat down and watched the Go-Go's.  The Go-Go's were there.  The Go-Go's were playing.  The actual Go-Go's.  All right.  Yes.  Yeah.  Doing both Go-Go's and Belinda Carlisle songs.  Of course.  Yeah.  Did she do Heaven is a Place on Earth? 
[03:19:30]  No, that's the one they didn't do.  What?  We got the beat?  Yes.  We got the beat.  Vacation?  Vacation.  All the hits.  It was great.  Our lips are sealed?  Yes.  Ha ha!  Right!  Oh.  Why would you just...  Jeez.  You get it, because when you eat and...  Oh, God.  You know what he's getting at.  You know what he's getting at.  Because no one's paying attention.  No.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  And then the next day, because they switched up the bands every three days. 
[03:20:00]  Sure, I wouldn't do it for a special vacation.  But we were at the end of the Go-Go's run.  Uh-huh.  The next day, it was Air Supply, and who wants to sit there and watch Air Supply?  Oh, no.  Air Supply.  No.  No.  Jesus.  So you go back and continue eating and drinking until you somehow make it back to your hotel.  Wow.  So that was fun.  And, you know, of course, shopping and other little extras.  You go to a downtown Disney?  Oh, we did.  Now, what did you do there?  There's some shows. 
[03:20:30]  There's a lot of shopping.  A lot of shopping.  Yeah, restaurants.  A lot of shopping, a lot of exclusive stuff.  Did you eat at the Rainforest Cafe?  No.  That seemed a little tacky.  That's just so maul and cheesy.  But I watched the, they have a volcano that erupts.  Of course, yes.  So I watched that.  I remember that.  But then there was a specialty toy store that they had there where you get to build your own things.  Oh, was this the Lego store?  No, there was the Lego store near there.  Yeah, yeah.  But, no, this was all Disney stuff where you could build, you could build droids and lightsabers. 
[03:21:00]  Okay, so because Disney now owns Star Wars, a lot of that merchandising.  Did you go there?  Yeah, I did.  Did you pick up some gifts for yourself?  No, I didn't buy, I bought for some other people, but I didn't buy any of the Star Wars stuff for me.  Did you build anything?  No, not from there.  Oh, man.  That's too bad.  What do you mean not from there?  From where?  Where I bought stuff?  Where did you build stuff from?  Oh, no, I didn't build stuff or anything for myself. 
[03:21:30]  I bought stuff from other places.  Uh-huh.  But not from there.  I spent a lot of money when I was at Universal at the new Springfield, USA section of the park.  Oh, Simpsons Land.  Yes, Springfield.  So you bought some things.  A lot of things.  Picked up a few things.  Treated yourself.  A lot of things.  Wow.  This just sounds crazy.  It was amazing attention to detail that they did in that park.  Sure.  Good, good.  What are we getting at here? 
[03:22:00]  Oh, boy.  Well, you must have been happy when you got the news, when you heard the audio.  Wow, look.  It's like you're in Springfield.  This is terrific.  It looks stupid.  It looks stupid.  It looks pricey.  Oh, man.  It's got Moe's.  Krusty Burger's there.  Krusty Burger.  Quickie Mart.  And I'll bet Krusty Burger isn't exactly fast food prices.  No.  It is quite pricey.  Did you eat at Krusty Burger? 
[03:22:30]  Yes.  Did you have a drink at Moe's?  I had a flaming Moe at Moe's.  You had a flaming Moe.  And I had...  You know what the secret ingredient is, right?  I had a duff.  You have to have a duff.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's cough syrup.  Was Moe behind the bar?  No.  There were other people there.  Where was Moe?  I don't know.  Moe wasn't there.  Are there any Simpsons people walking around?  Yeah.  I got a couple of photos with some characters. 
[03:23:00]  Okay.  Then they had Lard Lad Donuts.  Ah, yeah.  Did you get yourself a snack?  I did.  We're good.  Or two.  Is it not as long as?  Three.  Four.  I don't know.  Five.  Oh, maybe a mobile one.  Six.  Seven.  Oh.  Well, I got to tell you.  It's another Eric Nagel?  No, that's me.  Oh, you defriended me and then refriended me?  Yeah.  You just defriended me then.  When did you defriend me?  Who knows?  Probably Friday.  Probably Friday.  Yeah, he had enough. 
[03:23:30]  And then he refriended me.  Thank you for refriending me.  Are we unfriended too, Eric?  Oh, the big Springfield.  No, I like the Jim Norton page.  Thank you.  Look at that.  Very nice.  Jabba Diah Springfield.  Jabba Diah Springfield statue.  They went all out on the Simpsons world, which means they must charge quite a bit once  you're in there.  Yeah.  Things are not...  See that donut there?  Wow, yeah.  It's this big.  Oh, man.  That's probably like eight inches long, nine inches long.  Did you eat it?  I had a couple of bites.  It's too sweet, but... 
[03:24:00]  Oh, man.  Not for you.  Duff Gardens.  Yeah.  Wow.  God, that's crazy.  I would do nothing here.  Surly?  You'd do nothing?  No, it's just not my world, you know?  Oh, my God.  They got the Android's dungeon and baseball card shop.  Yeah.  Right.  Where the comic book guy works.  Yeah.  Did you go in there?  No, it's a facade.  A false front.  Oh, they got some false fronts.  They got some false fronts there.  Well, that was the only one.  Everything else is a store.  It's just a stupid cartoon.  But it's still in characters.  It says, sorry, we're closed for Bi-Mon Sci-Fi Con. 
[03:24:30]  Right.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Which is the bi-monthly science fiction convention.  Really funny.  Let's go through a show somewhere.  Quickie Mart.  Wow.  You can get a Squishy.  Squishy.  Did you?  Squishy.  No, I didn't get Squishy.  Look at this.  I was drinking a lot.  You can get Buzz Cola.  Did you walk around with a solid Buzz for most of the trip?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Very, very, uh...  Fucking zooted.  Look at the details here.  Do not accept checks from Chief Wiggum, Reverend Lovejoy, Homer J. Simpson, Homer S. Simpson,  H.J. Simpson, Homor Simpson, or Homer J. Fong. 
[03:25:00]  I love it.  A lot of inside jokes.  Yes.  They ran out of Bort name tags.  Another inside joke.  I like it.  But anyway, so, yeah, went through Springfield, went through, um, all this stuff.  There was shopping and extras.  Extras.  Which had to be accounted for.  Did you buy any, uh, clothing at the Simpsons World?  Oh, I did.  You did?  You'll see a lot of shirts starting to circulate, too.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Putting them into rotation.  Ah, the Frying Dutchman. 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  Seafood.  Wonderful.  So there was that.  Um, then the flights that you had asked about.  Yes, what airline?  We flew United.  Oh, okay.  Very nice.  Did you use miles?  Uh, we did.  Oh.  Nice.  First class?  Um, no, not first class.  But whatever that new section is that they have right outside of first class.  Business?  Oh.  Economy Plus?  I guess, or whatever.  Because we were right by the curtain to...  Okay, that's Economy Plus.  A little more leg room. 
[03:26:00]  Yep.  So you used miles to fly, so the flight didn't cost anything?  Uh, no, it did.  It's just some miles, but it didn't cover everything.  Okay.  Just miles to upgrade to Economy Plus.  So there's round trips for that.  And then, of course, you know, you have, uh, uh, some baggage fees because of the, uh...  Sure.  ...limits that they put on the bag.  Oh, boy.  50 pounds.  Right.  And when, you know, when you're doing that much shopping, there's, you're going to have  to pay it.  That sounds, uh... 
[03:26:30]  And then airport parking, when you get back.  All right.  That's not free.  All right.  We get it.  Airport parking's a lot.  It sure is.  You treated yourself.  We get it.  Money well spent.  Yeah.  So there's a nice subtotal here for that.  And then, uh, the expenses for the phone.  Okay.  Right.  Which, um...  I don't remember that being part of the deal.  I was helped with, uh, that to get the quote.  I don't remember that being part of the deal.  Does anyone remember that being part of the deal?  Uh, the phone?  I, I do.  Yeah.  I do remember hearing that.  I do remember that.  No, that was Sam trying to push it forward. 
[03:27:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  I brought it up, and it seems right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sam and, uh, Roland were very helpful with that.  What do you mean?  I didn't agree to that.  You should, though.  You did.  You said you would cover the, uh, the phone.  And then Jim had said, you know, because it was going to take a year, um, so people who  had the old number would, you know, I could keep in contact with.  Are you pretending to be on this phone next to Nelson?  Uh, I'm actually on the phone.  Ooh.  On the phone.  He's answering a call and yelling, slobbo.  Oh.  So when you pick up the phone.  Like at Moe's? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Terrific.  Oh.  It's just horrible.  This sounds like the worst vacation ever.  It was fantastic.  B-Rock is holding up a donut next to the statue holding a donut.  Why did you pick up a phone so you can be pranked?  Oh, he's like, who gives a fuck?  Jesus, I get you like the show.  Oh.  Are you pretending to be Homer in this picture?  No, I'm just having a beer at Moe's Tavern.  And watching the Simpsons TV.  Yep.  They have it up on the TV.  They sure do. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  So would you like the bill?  Well, I guess all this boils down to a total of some way, shape, or form.  Obviously, I fucked up.  Yeah.  All right.  It was a horrible mistake.  I openly admit that.  Hold on.  And I'm taking full responsibility.  That's why I said I would pay for this shit.  Because other people say I take full responsibility, but nothing ever.  But they don't mean it.  Right.  When nothing happens, they just say it, and that's good enough.  Yeah, lip service.  Exactly. 
[03:28:30]  There's a lot to pay for, dude.  I'm prepared.  All right.  And flight, hotel, vacation expenses, and the brand new phone.  The grand total comes, too.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM on demand.  After ONA Live is next.  Feel like telling someone to fuck off?  Fuck you.  Hey, fuck you.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, fuck you, too.  What's your name?  Fuck you.  That's my name.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  To my pancreas.  And if your call doesn't suck, it just might make it on the air.  Fuck you.  You're cool.  Fuck you.  I'm out.  This is after Opie and Anthony live. 
[03:29:30]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  All right.  Good to have E-Rock back in the mix of things.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the number to call after Opie and Anthony live.  I guess money can do a lot.  Money can do a lot.  Would you say that a lot of the forgiveness, E-Rock, is centered around the money? 
[03:30:00]  Once the check's deposited and cleared.  Have you gotten a check?  Or is that still not?  It's in the works.  It's in the works.  All right.  Good luck.  Good luck.  617, you're on after Opie and Anthony live.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  Um, what's up with Audible?  Yeah, I don't know.  I get some tweets about that.  We're working on it, but, you know, I know that the show's been sent to Audible.  Uh, yeah, the show didn't pop up yesterday, right?  It didn't pop up yesterday. 
[03:30:30]  There's still one missing from last week.  I don't know.  I'll send some emails.  We'll try to get that resolved because it's, uh, it's very strange.  We just have a really strange system of getting the show to them.  And I don't know if it's on their side or what it is that there's confusion.  But for those that don't know, the show goes on audible.com every day and people pay and  they subscribe to Audible to listen to the show and they get it that way.  Um, and so, yeah, sometimes it doesn't pop up and people have concerns because they're  paying for it.  I don't blame them, but yeah, we'll figure, we'll figure it out. 
[03:31:00]  It shouldn't be happening.  617.  Yeah.  Uh, I can't tell you how pissed off I am.  I actually missed a meeting so I could pull over and listen to the show.  Okay.  Yeah.  And I wanted to hear what the bottom line was.  Right.  Okay.  Wait, where's the money?  All right.  And then all of a sudden, oh shit, the show's over.  I fucking hate you guys.  The amount didn't, didn't make it across the air, huh?  Oh, fuck. 
[03:31:30]  Well, look, you had to see it coming.  Sometimes you guys that listen to the show a lot, anybody that's willing to miss a meeting  has to know that as far as the Opie and Anthony show goes, anytime there is anything that is  promised, it's not going to get delivered at the time you think it is.  I have been listening for over 15 years.  Okay, but since I, I, oh, my God, I just, I am beside myself.  I want to kill somebody.  That's the art.  That's the art of it, my friend. 
[03:32:00]  And guess what?  You'll be listening tomorrow to figure out what that amount is, won't you?  Oh, fuck, get out of here.  Thank you, my friend.  Uh, 508.  Hey, hello?  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  You're on the air.  Hey, I listen to you, like, every day from 10 to 11.  Nice.  And, like, I hate it.  I, I, I, I have no other time in the car, but I don't like the other music on the radio.  You don't like music?  No, I like the music on the radio, and I don't like listening to you.  All right, well, then I'm going to say that the problem is probably in your tastes. 
[03:32:30]  If you can't find any music that you like, then I don't think I'm going to be able to  provide you with anything today.  Uh, 336.  Yeah, my radio seemed to go to commercial before we heard the bottom line.  Should we give out that bottom line number since we're already giving out phone numbers?  I don't know if we're still in the process of giving out phone numbers.  No, I think, uh, I don't know.  Do we need to get a bigger calculator, or what?  Yeah, maybe that we need a bigger calculator.  I'm surprised that that number didn't go out.  I don't know what the problem is.  Uh, let me go to 315. 
[03:33:00]  315, you're on the show.  Hey, did I hear a little bit of Opie's mom come out of him today when, you know, the focus  wasn't all on him?  How do you mean?  Uh, you know, Iraq was talking to the guys about where he was staying and what he was doing,  and all of a sudden Opie's yelling, trying to get the focus back.  Iraq, you did get Opie with a zinger today as far as that was concerned.  You walked in feeling very confident in that regard, didn't you?  I was stunt, you know.  Stunting.  Stunting is what you were doing.  I was stunting now.  I mean, despite all of this, you know, I still was quite aggravated over all of this. 
[03:33:30]  Are you still aggravated?  Because to me, it seems like you're at the phase now where you realize you've accepted  the fact that you're going to forgive that it happened, and you're kind of just enjoying,  you know, the attention and sort of having...  Not the attention, but we're getting to the process where everything's going to be taken  care of.  Well, you have people over a barrel.  Are you eating candy in there?  Yes, I am.  Of course you are.  Travis was selling candy, so...  So you had to purchase, right? 
[03:34:00]  You got a lot of money coming in.  But I think that you're at the point now where I believe on all weekend, I'll bet, you were  fuming furious, okay?  I was not happy.  I believe that because I would be absolutely beside myself if something like that happened  to me.  Like, you wouldn't be...  I don't know what I would do, but anybody who wished that they didn't have me on the  show would probably get their wish, at least for a small period of time.  But I think now you realize what's gone on. 
[03:34:30]  You've solved the problem to some extent in the sense that you got a new phone number.  You're not getting harassed like you were.  You're getting Opie calling you and apologizing.  You're getting Jim emailing you to apologize.  And now you're going to get yourself a nice little cash reward.  I think you're at the phase now where you might be enjoying this a little bit.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  I think I will be at a point once that deposit is made and everything is cleared, I think 
[03:35:00]  that will be the point where we can put all of this behind us.  I don't think you will, though, because I think you'll still have that little chip on  your shoulder of, ah, ah, ah, I caught you doing something that was really, really bad.  So it's one of those things where the show did something to you that was so bad, worse  than, it's, this is probably the worst thing the show's done to anybody I can think of.  I'm not going to make the definite statement that it's the worst thing it's ever done because  we've done.  Because we'll probably be proven wrong. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, we've done horrible, horrible shit.  But it's, I think the worst thing that's ever happened to you, correct?  Um, yeah, I would say.  So.  If, if not the top thing, it's right up there.  Right.  And so I think that now you have that and you have this confidence where you know that they're,  they won't go too hard on you for a little bit and you know that you'll always have this  complaint that whenever, if they complained about your work, for example, you could bring  up your phone number and everything would be okay. 
[03:36:00]  Giving out your phone number on the air can work as a positive to you and I think you're  figuring that out.  I think you'd be correct.  Okay.  All right.  I like the other, that you're, uh, that you're admitting that.  Let me go to, uh, Daniel.  It's funny.  It's because, you know, and you know what?  And I was thinking about this and it's, dude, it's the same thing I'd be doing.  I'm not faulting you at all for this.  I was thinking, okay, because I was putting myself in your position when it happened on  Friday.  Opie accidentally gives out, uh, oh, Daniel, you don't know what's going on?  No, dude.  I fucking slept late today. 
[03:36:30]  I fucking slept late.  I haven't, I got, as soon as I got in my truck, your show was starting and obviously  something fucking big happened and I missed it and just driving these fucking nuts.  On Friday, on Friday, uh, Opie was trying to call E-Rock while E-Rock was on vacation and  he put the phone up to the microphone while the voicemail was playing and E-Rock had one  of those automated voicemails that reads off the phone number.  So Opie gave E-Rock's phone number out on the air and, and, and it just completely destroyed  E-Rock's phone. 
[03:37:00]  Like, basically what you're telling me is Opie is almost as dumb as fucking Rich Voss.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I, and that's what it was compared to.  A lot of people, a lot of people brought up Rich Voss giving out his password and that,  yeah, I believe Opie made a mistake and it was one of the dumbest mistakes ever made on  the show because of the power that it gives E-Rock.  I was thinking to myself about how furious I would be at first, right?  But then I was thinking, okay, I would know that I'd have to some extent Opie over a  barrel because he feels so bad. 
[03:37:30]  I would know that I'd have Sirius XM over a barrel as I think E-Rock does because it's  a horrible thing that happened to me at the workplace.  So I was starting to think in my head of all the demands I'd be making.  And I think that's where E-Rock is.  He's got this little tiny window of time where I wouldn't be surprised if you saw E-Rock  getting some money, maybe a title change.  He's going to be confident in E-Rock for at least a couple of weeks before they bring  him back down to reality. 
[03:38:00]  Anthony in Staten Island.  Samuel Roberts, how are you today, sir?  Good.  Is E-Rock trying to say that this is worse than when the show actually tried to kill him during  the cinnamon challenge?  Okay, that's a great call.  Cinnamon challenge, E-Rock.  You took the cinnamon challenge.  You might have seen it on YouTube.  You're supposed to take a small like tablespoon full of cinnamon and you can't swallow it.  You start coughing, E-Rock took a full like whatever's bigger than a tablespoon, like a  kitchen spoon, whatever you eat cereal with. 
[03:38:30]  Bob Kelly filled it up with cinnamon and shoved it down the back of his throat.  I think all of us in studio, at least for a moment, were worried that E-Rock was going  to die that day.  You can see the video if you YouTube or Google E-Rock cinnamon challenge.  You can see that it looks as though he will never be able to breathe again.  E-Rock, this was worse than that?  Um, like I said earlier, it might be worse if not up there.  And I think the cinnamon challenge is the worst thing.  Now the cinnamon challenge, but here's where the phone number thing is, is bad. 
[03:39:00]  It's the psychological effect of it.  You're on vacation, you're trying to enjoy yourself, and then you start getting all these  texts and phone numbers from a bunch of assholes.  Then you realize the show has fucked me again.  Even while I'm on vacation, they're fucking me over.  Yeah, well, that develops anger and spite.  Right.  But in the whole scheme of all of this, almost dying really takes precedence over harassment. 
[03:39:30]  But you saw in their faces, when they thought you were going to die, Opie and Anthony, they  were, uh, they felt guilty.  Oh, I thought they were checking their phones.  At one point they were checking their phones, sure.  But for a moment, they felt guilty when they thought they had killed you, correct?  You can't confirm that.  I can't confirm that because I was dying.  Okay.  Well, I'm telling you, I think that this one might be a little worse because it seemed like  they were guilty when they thought they had killed you.  RC in Texas.  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Sam Roberts, how are you doing today?  Very good, buddy.  I was wanting to know if E-Rock was going to give us his new phone number so we'd be able  to get a hold of it.  Great call, RC.  E-Rock, if you could give the audience your new phone number so they can get a hold of  you.  Sure.  It starts with 417.  Oh.  Uh, whose phone number is that?  Oh, that's RC's?  Yeah.  No.  Jeff, that's, it'd be so funny if your new phone number got out there.  Jeff in Maryland.  Yeah, what's up?  No one catches this, uh, vacation, a kid's vacation at Disney World eating out. 
[03:40:30]  What kind of faggot vacation is this?  Jeez.  Dude, I gotta tell you.  It's not a kid's vacation, sir.  You know, you know I like to pile on E-Rock more than anyone.  If E-Rock's getting thrown under a bus, I like to jump on top of the bus and jump up  and down on it just so he's feeling that little tiny extra tire tread on his back.  However, Disney World is fucking awesome.  I don't have any kids and I've gone to Disney World with my wife.  I will go again before we have kids.  Okay, we are actually, we want to make sure before we have kids that we go back there 
[03:41:00]  so we can actually enjoy it the way it's supposed to be enjoyed without children.  That's a great, it's the most, it's the happiest place on earth, dude.  Oh, come on.  There's a lot of man things you can do.  Disney World is for kids.  Disney World is a lot of fun, okay?  What man things, sir?  Yeah, what, what, what?  What man things are you going to take your wife to?  What man things do you do?  We're taking Hawaii.  Go to the beach.  Go, go to Disney World.  They, look, you can go to the beach or you can go to Disney World, okay?  I've been to the beach.  I would like to go to Disney World. 
[03:41:30]  You get to go to Simpsons Land.  You get to ride Big Thunder Mountain.  It's a blast.  It's a blast.  The only thing I didn't get to do was Sam's favorite ride.  What's that?  The Aerosmith Rock and Roller Coaster.  Dude, I, why couldn't you do the Rock and Roller Coaster?  It was because about an hour before we got to the park, something happened and it took  a while to get the people that were on the ride off and then it was closed for the rest  of the day.  Oh.  They gave you passes, those fast, uh, fast passes.  Yeah, those things saying, you know, if it reopens, we'll get you right to the front  of the line and I, I love the Rock and Roller Coaster and I love the, uh, Expedition. 
[03:42:00]  I love Tower of Terror, of course, but I love Expedition Everest in Animal Kingdom, but that's  because I got to ride that ride like the first year it was open when the giant Yeti on the  ride was still working.  Now it doesn't work.  It just stays still, but it used to be animatronic.  They realized it was, uh, it was still stuck.  I mean, it kept getting stuck and broken, so they realized it was too expensive.  Uh, Snowy in Michigan. 
[03:42:30]  Snowy!  Oh, Snowy's usually good.  Stu!  Hey, Sam.  How you doing?  What's up, buddy?  How you doing, buddy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah.  Uh, I think, uh, you know, I've showed great restraints, you know, uh, I think, uh,  you should maybe have Chargers or a little Learjats or a little Gulfstream for the trip  back.  Yeah, dude, I can't tell you.  When did you find out that OB was going to take care of the vacation?  Not until, uh, late Friday.  Were you at home?  Not late Friday.  Uh, I was, yeah, I was, I just had gotten back. 
[03:43:00]  Ah, okay.  So, yeah, because I would have said, I, I, I'm with Stu.  Like, that's when you find out you're upgrading to first class immediately.  Thanks, Stu.  Uh, Sean in Ohio.  Hey, Mr. Sam Roberts.  Love the show.  Love the after show.  Thanks, bud.  Now, the man of the hour, Mr. Erock Nagel.  I'd like to say, welcome back.  And that was a wonderful show today, sir.  I love the new confidence.  Thank you, sir.  Get your slobo out of the way.  How long do you think the confidence is going to last, Erock? 
[03:43:30]  It'll, it'll last for a while.  I don't think so.  How long do you think?  Honestly.  Like, not on the after show.  Yeah.  I'm talking about on, on Opie and Anthony.  How long do you think your new confident ways will last?  I think, uh, you know, it's time for a change.  I think you'll be confident for, I don't think you'll make it to November still confident.  Well, thank you for saying that.  I don't.  Okay.  Do you?  I think I, yeah, I think things are, uh, things, I know that.  Things are on an upswing.  I know after the grace period, you know, it'll go back to jokes and songs and all that other 
[03:44:00]  nonsense.  But I think things are going to be a bit different now.  Okay.  All right.  I don't, but okay.  All right.  Snowy in Michigan.  I'm telling you, you're not going to make it to November.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I think it's ironic.  They always complain about Erock not paying attention, not having proper things line up.  And then the one time they had this phone message come up, they weren't paying attention  and didn't hit the dump button in time.  I think it's kind of ironic.  You think there might be conspiracy afloat?  I don't think it, I really, you know, I agree. 
[03:44:30]  I don't think Opie did it on purpose, but he was so busy trying to think of something mean  to say.  Yeah.  He was distracted.  Well, he did admit that, sir.  Yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the problem for Opie that he was, he didn't do it on purpose, but he was  distracted trying to think of a rude comment.  Now, do you believe what Anthony said today about being confused as to what exactly Opie was  doing?  And that's why he didn't hit the dump button.  Do you believe that?  Uh, I mean, here's the thing, you know, list, uh, until you're in the room looking at them 
[03:45:00]  and seeing and interacting and, and, you know, getting a feel for it, listening to it, you  think it's, it's bullshit, but when they're talking about it, I've seen them when all three  of them are having interviews on, um, discussions on the phone or talking about something, playing  audio, all three are not looking at each other.  Right.  They're doing other things and, you know, listening to something ready to comment when,  you know, audio stops, here's where we talk kind of thing.  I got to think that might've been the case. 
[03:45:30]  I got to tell you, I was in this room in the studio with them.  And when Opie was giving out your phone number, there was this kind of look around the room  like me, Jim and aunt, we're all looking at each other.  Like, what is Opie doing?  You know, none of us, I don't think anybody in there, I think Anthony is telling the truth.  I think he didn't hit the dump button because none of us thought for a second that Opie would  actually give your phone number out on the air.  And I, I agree with that.  Right.  Nobody here, even if I, if it was somebody else's number and I was on the board that day, I would 
[03:46:00]  think the same exact thing.  It's like, Opie's going to cut this off at some point.  What about Travis, who is running the board in that room, who has a dump button?  He came in here today and said, I hit the dump button, but it didn't dump.  I don't understand that.  Do you believe that?  Um, I don't know.  The Travis situation, I'm, you know, I'm discussing with him.  And then he said, Sal was a witness.  Sal comes forward and says, Travis, I am not a witness, which I think is repercussion. 
[03:46:30]  That's news to me.  But you know why, you know why that happened?  Oh, you weren't, were you here?  Yeah, you were here a couple of weeks ago.  When Travis and Sal got into a big fight because Sal was coming to work at six o'clock  and didn't understand why people were upset.  I have the production piece here.  Of course.  Of course.  Uh, let me go to Max in Massachusetts.  What's up, Max?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Enough about this fat male kid.  I want to see the boat movie.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you, Max.  Doesn't happen on this show, sir.  Uh, Doug in Boston.  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  I'm still crazy about the fact.  I want to know how much money Opie has to come up with.  Yeah.  I mean, I thought that we got to that at the end of the show.  I'm just not sure.  Bill in Maine.  Hey, I just wanted to know, E-Rock, how's it feel to, uh, to get an enormous pay raise  from Sirius?  And Sam, how come you don't talk a shit like you were on Friday about E-Rock?  I wasn't talking, I mean, E-Rock, you heard the segment, right?  Yeah, you, you threw in your little, uh, jabs here and there.  Well, I threw my jabs in today, too, I thought.  I know you did.  I mean, I don't think, I don't think...  Look, Sam's an asshole, but he's consistent. 
[03:47:30]  I'm not two-faced.  I tell the truth.  If I think something's funny, I'll take some jabs.  But I'll certainly say that as far as whether or not I think E-Rock should have been furious  about what happened on Friday, I'm 100% for E-Rock.  I would have been livid.  Sam reached out.  Yeah, because I was thinking, whether it was a, whether it was...  It took me a while to realize you did, but you sent me a message.  Well, I sent it to your wife because I figured it might get lost.  I thought there might be a couple people texting you on your phone number, so... 
[03:48:00]  You know what?  There was something that was actually kind of funny in today's show that Ope said he  was proud that the last text I was able to send from that phone...  Was to him.  ...was to him saying, what the fuck are you doing, asshole?  Larry in Indiana.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  What's up, buddy?  Hi, I wanted to ask Eric a question or two if I could, please.  Rock and roll.  Of course you can, Larry.  My show is your show.  Hi, Larry. 
[03:48:30]  Hello, Eric.  Um, first I have to get this out of the way.  Legos!  Legos.  Okay.  Now that's over with.  Um, I called the show previously, a long time ago, when you were especially getting pounded,  and I said, is Eric any good at his job?  And they said you were the absolute best.  Was I here when they said that?  Yeah.  I mean, who said that?  I don't think I would have said that.  This was about two or three years ago.  Oh.  Because I don't, I don't, I don't want you. 
[03:49:00]  I'm just saying, like, Larry, if we're talking about keeping things, you know, truthful and  making sure everybody's on the same page, I don't want my name being associated with  that quote.  I understand.  I didn't say it was you, Sam.  Okay, good.  Someone behind the scenes, whoever was call screening, and they said, well, he's the best.  I see, I see.  So it's somebody probably not terribly informed.  Probably an intern.  Why would you put up with this shit from these assholes, and they hung up on me?  Ah, Larry, why anybody would hang up on you ever is beyond me.  Well, just ask my ex-wife, and she'll tell you exactly why they would. 
[03:49:30]  But, Eric, I posit that question again.  Why do you put up with this shit from these assholes?  Good question.  Eric, why do you put up with this shit?  Well, Larry, unfortunately, you know, there is real work out there that I don't seem interested  in doing, and I like having my career.  You're telling me you're a very lazy man.  You like getting an exorbitant paycheck for a minimal amount of work.  Would you like to go back to loading a truck or any kind of manual labor outside, like landscaping? 
[03:50:00]  Not that there's anything wrong with that stuff, but do you want to go do that after doing this  kind of job?  No, I don't want to go back, and I'd be back at work in the Clearview Movie Theater in  Maronek or something like that.  So, you know, you have to pick and choose your battles, and, you know, be an adult about  things sometimes, put up with shit, and...  Or throw a little bit of a hissy fit, and then see if you can get a whole bunch of money  out of Opie.  That's true, too.  That's one thing you could do.  We have a question from Jason in Detroit. 
[03:50:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey, E-Rock, before I get to my question, I hope you post some pictures on Twitter from the  Simpsons line.  I'd really like to see those.  You know what?  I'll put them up on the O&A Facebook.  Okay.  Just give me a little while.  I'll do it.  Okay.  How bad were the comments and stuff like that?  And I'll admit I sent you a Slavo that I...  But I'm going to admit it, but then I go back.  Like, I'm sorry, you know, but, you know, I was trying to get in with the phone.  Did you get...  Thank you, Jason.  Did you get to read...  Did you get to read any of the texts or hear any of the voicemails, or did your phone 
[03:51:00]  just shit out because of the volume?  The voicemails, I couldn't get to because that whole thing just fucking, you know, locked  up.  I got to scan some of the voicemail...  The text that I was getting before the thing shit to bed.  Slavo, at some points, was the least offensive.  Least?  The least offensive.  And you're very offended by that term.  Yeah, I'm not a fan of it, but that was the least of some of the comments that I was 
[03:51:30]  getting.  And what were some of the more offensive comments?  Well, there was people, you know, who don't understand, even though they're fans of the  show, they don't understand where certain lines are.  So, you know, when you're...  Yeah, I hear from those guys from time to time.  When you get threats, especially, you know, made towards people that aren't on the show.  Right.  That's crossing a line, but...  I'll never understand that.  Like, how can...  I don't understand it either.  Psychotic behavior.  Especially for something like, whether you like us on the show or not, just listening to 
[03:52:00]  the show every day, it's almost...  Why you would go and threaten somebody's family and just...  Who knows?  I mean, obviously they're deranged, whatever.  I mean, we do get those.  Everyone on this show does get those threats at some point, some more than others.  Right.  But, you know, there does come a point where we do get those kind of threats, but we're  on the air, it comes with the territory.  But when, you know, it involves family and other people, that's where you're just like,  really, dude?  And you're a fan of this show, and you're not understanding what you're doing with this? 
[03:52:30]  So your phone just gave up because of the volume of calls coming into it?  The calls, the voicemails, the text, plus the photos being sent in.  Now you know how your stomach feels.  I could just hit the sweeper and go to Ron and Fez right now.  I'm just kidding.  I was just sitting on that for a while, and I'm sorry that I said it, but I got to take  calls.  Jody in Canada.  See, you move quickly.  You move quickly.  Jody.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't hit the button. 
[03:53:00]  I was moving too quickly.  Jody.  How's it going there, Sam?  Good, Jody.  Good.  I just got a question.  I was listening to you guys, Tony, yesterday, and fucking to start off the show, fucking Norton  there, he was talking about Opie's cat, or Anthony's cat.  Now, they went into that little segment, but after the show was over and I went into replay,  I clicked over to Howard Stern, and they had a fucking cat segment on there, too.  Is there any way that you guys are intertwined?  I hope not.  Yeah, no.  Actually, what they're doing is they're trying to change the platform of SiriusXM. 
[03:53:30]  An email went out from our new CEO at the end of last week, and they're trying to shift  as many of the shows on the platform to cat programming.  They're trying to see if we can slowly infuse more cat topics.  They did some research and found out that most of the people who subscribe to SiriusXM  are cat lovers, so we're trying to shift all programming to more cat-centered themes. 
[03:54:00]  So I hope that's something that you guys are into.  Dan in North Carolina.  Good one, Sam.  That's funny.  Hmm?  That's funny.  You're sarcasm with that dude.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Go ahead.  Yeah, man.  It's a cat thing, man.  It's a cat thing.  No, I know.  I was being sarcastic with you, too.  I knew what you were talking about.  Okay, fine.  Eric, you best not fucking apologize.  Yeah, you better not apologize.  Why would I apologize?  Good.  No, yeah, exactly. 
[03:54:30]  But the reason why I call it, it's all this is the buildup's going to be for nothing.  You know all Opie's going to do is turn around and say, I'm a fucking millionaire.  Who cares?  And then the end of all of this.  Yeah, Opie better not try to downplay this.  And let me tell you something.  I know the number that E-Rock is looking at and the range in which E-Rock is looking, that  number is going to hurt Opie.  I don't care how much he says he's a millionaire.  It's a big number.  It's going to hurt Opie.  Don in Texas.  Hey, yeah, just, you know, it's sad that what, you know, happened to E-Rock and everything, 
[03:55:00]  but I did, you know, go ahead and send him some pictures.  I wanted to make sure that, you know, I wasn't one of the ones that offended him and everything  and that he really did enjoy the pictures of the horrible vaginas that I was sending him.  Did you enjoy the horrible vaginas that Don sent you, Eric?  I did favorite them, sir.  You did.  You saved them to the photo stream.  I had a little sunshine on your, you know, on your bad vacation there.  Good, good.  So you were sitting there going, like, your vacation was ruined, Disney World was ruined, 
[03:55:30]  your phone number's out there, and what'd you show to your wife?  Well, at least Don sent me some nice vaginas.  Followed by a bunch of sis, sis, sis.  Yes, yes.  Jared in Wisconsin.  Now, E-Rock, your vacation was done Friday afternoon or Friday night, right?  You got home Friday night.  We got home Friday night.  Okay, and Opie released this information on Friday, correct?  Friday morning.  Friday morning, yeah.  Why does Opie have to pay you for a whole vacation?  This should be prorated, man.  This doesn't wreck your whole vacation.  This might have wrecked, like, three, four hours of it. 
[03:56:00]  Because Greg Hughes is a man of his word, and this is what he said on the air.  He offered it, and, yeah, I mean, I hope he was dumb enough to offer it,  and at the same time, the psychological, and I'm going to be E-Rock's lawyer on this,  the psychological trauma that E-Rock had to endure.  And my family.  And E-Rock's family had to endure on Friday morning, the last day of his vacation, 
[03:56:30]  closed his vacation on such a terrible note that it clouded the entire memory of it.  I'm seeing prorated.  You hope only wrecked, like, probably, what, seven, eight hours of your vacation?  Jared, I'll see you in court.  I'm going to win this one, Jared.  Later, boys.  Later, buddy.  I also wanted to say that we were talking about Curt Schilling on the show today.  I don't know if you heard it from the beginning, but listen to the replay or On Demand if you didn't.  I couldn't feel worse for this dude. 
[03:57:00]  Like, as much as E-Rock, it sucks for E-Rock that he got a bunch of vaginas sent to his cell phone,  imagine making the money of a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox like Curt Schilling,  not just a Major League Baseball player, but a famous Major League Baseball player, a star.  And he puts all his money into this video game that fails.  We were talking about him.  We were going through.  He's now selling everything in his house. 
[03:57:30]  I mean, it's just – it's hilarious when you're outside of it, but if you give it any thought whatsoever,  it's the most – it's one of the more tragic things you could ever think of.  I am going to – we played a couple clips, but this Sunday, because a couple people were asking me,  this Sunday on my show here on the Opie and Anthony channel, it's at 4 p.m. Eastern,  I'll play the whole Curt Schilling interview.  He came in and did an interview with me promoting this video game  and talking about how great it was going to be and how he was going to – 
[03:58:00]  this was something he was going to excel at and this was the next stage of his life and all this stuff.  He came in guns blazing, ready for this game to be a huge success.  There's no awareness that this decision would be the worst one he ever made in his entire life, bar none.  So I will re-air that interview on Sunday for those that want to hear it.  E-Rock, welcome back.  Thank you.  Everybody's enjoying the confident E-Rock while we have him.  Once again, I've been here for a long time. 
[03:58:30]  It's not going to last long.  So enjoy it while you can.  And if you do get a check from Opie tomorrow, we do lunch maybe?  We'll see.  Let's do it.  We'll do lunch tomorrow.  In the meantime, stay tuned because Ryan and Fez are coming up next.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 16. </pre>
